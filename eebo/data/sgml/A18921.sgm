<P>_AGainst my booke (<HI>touching Error on the Right ha~d</HI>) certaine fiddle-fad|dle Spirits do take exception.</P>
<P>Some say there be certaine formes of speech farre vnworthy the pen of a Preacher. I grant that somethings be much vnworthy, both my <HI>writing</HI> &amp; many their <HI>hearing;</HI> howsoeuer the Schismatikes thinke the things<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezec. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> 5. 16. 17. 5 16. 17. 25. 26. &amp; 23. 3. 8. &amp;c.</NOTE> not vnworthy their <HI>Doing. Ezekiel</HI> was forced to speake more grosly then he would; when from filthines of the body, he would delineate the soules vncleannes for Idolatry. The like also did Saint <HI>Iohn.</HI> Let the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reu. 17. 4</NOTE> Factious be ashamed of <HI>so</HI> doing, and
<PB REF="4">
we will be ashamed of so writing and hearing.</P>
<P>Some say that in the Diologicall speeches, I seeme to point at certaine particular persons, vpon whom some of my speeches cannot be truely faste|ded. I grant; first that I haue aymed at some particular persons, so well as they in their Dialogues of the <HI>Barwicke Souldier,</HI> the Host and Chaplaine &amp;c. with many such Mar|tinicall libels, haue done right often. But as their magnaticall one-eard Inuectiues were set on fire from hell, for destroying the Church peace, so, I doubt not but my feruent breathings, will be found to haue beene kindled by the coales of the Altar, for the con|sumption of Schisme Let them con|sider the parable of <HI>Iothams</HI> trees, that gathered together for electing a King; when as none but the brabling<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iudg. 9. 8. &amp;c.</NOTE> Bramble would accept of the offer. That parable will fit them, as if it one|ly
<PB REF="4">
had propounded vnto them. Se|condly I answere, though all there spoken, cannot bee auerred of euery person in a faction, (by reason no fa|ction is at vnity in it selfe) yet it may sit close to some other they thinke not of, in the same faction: and <HI>po|tentially,</HI> though <HI>not actually,</HI> con|cord with the leud spirit of that whole Corporation.</P>
<P>Besides, to such as say, that <HI>Aria|nisme</HI> was long since confuted by the Fathers, and what neede <HI>Clapham</HI> meddle with it, &amp;c? I answer: first by Retortion: So <HI>Donatisme, Ana|baptisme, Reordination Nicolai|tisme, Atheisme &amp;c.</HI> were confu|ted by the Fathers (so was the very adultery, murder, &amp;c.) what need a|ny preacher then iterate these argu|ments? The answer to the last, will fit<NOTE PLACE="marg">So M^r. More in his tables doth re|cord.</NOTE> the first. Secondly, I answer: Our heretikes haue added vnto the ancie~t teaching such conclusions as of old
<PB REF="5">
were not dream'd of. And had I not<NOTE PLACE="marg">one Arrian Anabap|tist, &amp; ano ther, a lu|ish Arrian, both burnt at <HI>Norwich</HI></NOTE> by trauaile abroad found out that, I might seeme vnto many to speake but in darke parables. Search all the bookes that I haue writ, and that is from <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1595. hitherto, 1608.) and consider if still I pro|noked not all the Factious, specially on the right hand, howsoeuer hither|to vnanswered of any. VVhich doubt|les they would haue done, had I not too truely pressed them. Thirdly I an|swere, I know none that condemne my labours, of that kind, but suchas be either <HI>open</HI> foes, or <HI>hypocriticall</HI> brethren. If open foes, then no mar|uaile though they ball and barke a|gainst me, whenas they raile against the whole body of the Church. If <HI>Hy|pocriticall</HI> brethren, who let some Factious haue their hearts, and for maintenance sake let vs haue their bodies onely, I waie not of their doome no more then of <HI>Laodiceans</HI> deuotio~:
<PB REF="5">
for what is such an Hypocrite, but an <HI>Ambo</HI> between two, a bifronted <HI>Ia|nus</HI> looking two wayes, and a <HI>Neu|ter</HI> faithfull to none? The opposite side do spit at them, and can we do lesse then spurne them?</P>
<P>In this booke is acted <HI>Errour on the Left hand.</HI> In the fore-front wherof I haue Marshalled the <HI>Roma|nist,</HI> as one who primordially through a frozen security, did decline towards <HI>Libertinisme,</HI> establishing such de|uises, as vnto flesh and blood might be most acceptable. Vnto which side also, if I had reduced the carnall Familist, (for there be a second sort more spi|rituall) I suppose I had done him no wrong. But sit as they shall, naught be they all, and it is the naughtines of their opinions that I specially dart at.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Male-content,</HI> I make him the <HI>Nicka-fidge</HI> here (running from one faction vnto another) as I
<PB REF="6" MS="y">
did the <HI>Flyer</HI> in the former. VVho al|so here doth at last meet with <HI>Medi|ocrity;</HI> and so (after some dehateme~t) become an honest man. Worse I wish to no <HI>Flyer,</HI> nor a straw the worse to any Mal-contented. <HI>Dei est non er|rare, hominis errare, insipientis perseuerare in errore.</HI></P>

<P>If thou canst well relish the <HI>Mat|ter,</HI> but not the <HI>Maner</HI> of handling: (for euery one doth quickly conceit a Dialogicall <HI>Prosopopeia</HI>) I then re|ferre thee to my <HI>Antidoton,</HI> my <HI>New Ierushalem,</HI> my <HI>Manuall of the Bibles doctrine,</HI> together with diuers of the heades, sparsed in my <HI>Bibles briefe,</HI> in my poeme <HI>Aelo|him,</HI> and fiue parts of my labours of <HI>Salamons Song;</HI> not to mention
<PB REF="6">
any of my imperfect workes printed abroad ouer immaturely.</P>
<P>But to helpe the slowe conceited (for these two bookes of Dialogues were penned, almost altogether for such about the citie of London, who are ordinarily toyled with the Fa|ctious) it must first be obserued that the maine thing I driue at, is, to vn|fold the principall argument, where|by euery sort of Schismatique doth fabricate vnto himselfe a new society or Church. Secondly, to shewe, how that principall argument is laide at home by our <HI>Mal-content,</HI> where|upon others build their rendings from vs. Thirdly, to disclose such their ar|gume~t, by that forme of introducting them, in their mutuall brablings, wherein, as sometimes one of them confuteth another, so, much of their extrauagant speech is so absurd, <HI>Vt recitare, idem est quod refutare,</HI> As the bare repetition is a sufficient
<PB REF="7">
refutation. Lastly, my drift is, in the person of <HI>Mediocrity,</HI> to esta|blish a <HI>Meane;</HI> Which held and kept according to knowledge may keepe our people from flying out into ex|treames, as they would auoide the grosse and leaud consequents insuing their breach from vs.</P>
<P>Had not some learned (in authori|ty) obserued so many points (at least) in my former booke it had not obtai|ned a <HI>passe</HI> to the presse: For sure I am, that it stood vpon more sufficient examination, then all the books which besides I haue diuulged. So much is sufficient for reasonable spirits. As for such as be wilfully malitious and ignorant, nothing will content them; <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Pro. 26. 4.</NOTE> Neither will I answere such a foote to his full, lest I be|come like him. <HI>Neque Iupiter omnibus pluens placet, neque abstinens.</HI> The Lord deliuer our Church from euill.</P>

<HEAD>THE FIRST DIALOGVE <HI>between</HI> Mal-content <HI>and</HI> Romanist.</HEAD>
<STAGE>First, it must be conceiued, that <HI>Malcontent</HI> sitting vnder a tree, in the Hie-way, hee thus alone expostulates with himselfe.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Malcontent.</SPEAKER>
<P>_O <HI>Mal-content,</HI> how vn|happy art thou in this life, whither shalt thou go, and what will be|come of thee? Go to the Brownist, shall I do so? In them and their proceedings, I find no vnity, no concordance; Their hand being a|gainst all, and the hands of all against them. The <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Geo. Io.</NOTE> brother of that Chur|ches Pastor, hath writ a great booke against them, their vnsetled resoluti|ons, bloody excommunications, and hie-handed tyrannies; as if the Pastor were a Pope, taking more vpon them (for the measure of strength they haue) then do all the English prelates. In so much as, howsoeuer he per|swades
<PB N="2" REF="9">
people to ioine with the cause of Separation, as himselfe had (and therein since hath died) yet, at no hand to ioyne with his brothers con|gregation: for manifold reasons there alledged.</P>
<P>Since which time, one (whose<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">M^r. Sm.</NOTE> name soundes vpon an Anuile) hath dra|wen certaine <HI>Principles and inferences, touching a true visible Church;</HI> where in he quoteth scripture for another forme of discipline, then that which the Brownist practise, and most of vs haue taught in our sermons and wri|tings: He purposing as it seemeth, to receiue others into communion with him, who shall separate, as he hath&punc; and so shew themselues willing to be ruled by his discipline. Aes me, which side shall I leane vnto? Both of them hold a <HI>set forme</HI> of discipline to be contained in the word. Both of them alleadge (for the substance thereof) the very sarue scriptures; but both of them differ exceedingly in the sense of such Scriptures.</P>
<P>Another side, hauing no Baby for
<PB N="3" REF="9">
their leader (although his sir name begin with a <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Him and his words I haue al+ledged in my preface to my <HI>Ma+nuall.</HI></NOTE> B.) he holds both with the gouernement at home by Lord Bishops; as also, with that of Lay|elders abroad; as being in the scrip|tures neither commanded, nor for|bidden, but things in themselues of an indifferent nature. So he holdes, and yet denies to <HI>subscribe,</HI> for sundry reasons. Shall I separate with the first two? or shal I continue in the Church of England with the third?</P>
<P>But miserable man, how shall sepa|ration, or not separation be good? If I separate from the Church as Antichristian, then the Anabap|tist take hold vpon me, and saith&punc; that I must separate not so much for the prelaticall discipline; as for that the spirit of Antichrist there breath|eth Antichristian doctrine. Yea that the Church becomes to be Antichri|stian: for that their groundes of faith therein held, be principles opposite to Christ. And in my co~science, if the first be granted, the second will ine|uitably follow.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="10">If I separate not, but continue still in the Church, I shall in my worke iustifie that which I haue condemned in word. In word I haue condem|ned the Tippet, the Surplice, the Corner-cap, the Crosse in Baptisme, and the like for markes of Antichrist. But forsaking my ministry, I may liue in some other calling, and so be put to the vse of no such ceremonies. Yea but if I haue a child, I must bring it, where before I will not, it cannot be baptized without the crosse. Come I to the Co~mon seruice, I must sit in the sight of a Surplice; and come I to the Co~munion, I must there kneele &amp; re|ceiue at the hands of one that vseth the ceremonies. And be I called to be a Church-warden&punc; I must take an oath to present the sincere-sort&punc; that omit, or speake against such ceremonies. I am diuided in my selfe, what shall I doe? <HI>H. I.</HI> his followers do say very well, that this persecution is worse then that of Queene <HI>Maries:</HI> for that made an end of a man quickly; but this grants life with a continuing
<PB N="5" REF="10">
misery. Wo is me, how is my soule pained within me? Though hereto|fore Ifumed against the author of that booke, intituled <HI>Errour on the Right|hand,</HI> yet now mine affections bee cooled and calmed: for well I see, that there is nothing yet right amongst them. And at home I know not how to liue, as I would not be held an Hypocrite or turne-coat. The eua|sion must be by some third meanes, &amp; that as yet I know not. Rest poore head, rest&punc; rest against this trees roote, and take a little nap in the shade.</P>

<P>What fast asl&eacute;epe? who may he be? By his habite h&eacute;e should be some Scholar or Citizen. Whoo I know him, it is <HI>Male-content,</HI> whose head is full of whirligigs, and whose pen spins nought but Cob-webs.

<P>Fire, fire, <HI>Elias</HI> fire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Romanista.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is calling for fire from heauen, as did <HI>Elias:</HI> But it will burne as fast, I thinke&punc; as did our Uault-gun|powder, that should haue blowne vp the Parliament-house in West|minster, together with all the heads of the Country. But stay, some po|litique retch now or neuer: for an inch of policie, I hold better then an ell of Diuinity. In the time of discontent it is best working vpon <HI>Malcontent:</HI> for vpon <HI>conceit</HI> it is then most easy to worke. I re|member a Dialogue in <HI>Erasmus</HI> his great <HI>Colloquium;</HI> where one pas|sing by the hie-way, was desire us to fasten some strange conclusion vp|pon the conceit of his fellow Pas|sengers. Hereupon h&eacute;e stops his course, with his eies vpon the fir|mament fixed, gaping, gazing, cros|sing, blessing, trembling. The pas|sengers thereupon stay, looke vp, and wonder whereat he should so wonder. Anon, as with much ado, he tels them what a fearefull signe
<PB N="7" REF="11">
he saw in the firmament, a Dragon&punc; a terrible thing in description, I warrant you; hereupon he startles&punc; holds vp his hands and wondreth at all the rest, that they should say they see nothing. Anon, one of the~ think|ing scorne, but he should see as much as another, he also affirmeth that he saw such a terrible wonder: After|wards, some and some, euery one said he saw it, and trembled. In this dialogue (some haue thought) that <HI>Erasmus</HI> flouted people in England, for conceiting a certain great prelate in the Churches firmament, beyond that they should conceit, &amp;c. But howsoeuer, I will take aduantage of the time, and see if so I can worke some strange thing vpon him. I hope it the rather, because one of this spirit (a <HI>Sole&punc; sincerian</HI>) being of late conuented before a great Prelate of this land, he offred, that if he the said Prelate, could proue but one point then in hand, hee would without more adoe turne back to the Church of Rome. whereupon the Prelate
<PB N="8" REF="12">
spake to this effect: I, is it true in|d&eacute;ed? are you now ready to go a po|ping? what a poping I had thought there had bin many grou~ds of oppo|sitio~ between vs &amp; them (howsoeuer this stands) y^<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> would haue kept you fro~ poping: wel, I wil break one cud|gel of my inuentio~ vpon him.

<P>But stay, stay, this can be but some notable delusion: for what holines can there be in Romes religion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roman.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Sir, he told me, that you would not submit your selfe to the truth, but vpon palpable reasons. I was this morning, as you haue beene, and yet are, a desirer of Reformation. But all in vaine, to s&eacute;eke after a reforming of <HI>Israel,</HI> beeing once schismed from <HI>Iudah.</HI> To k&eacute;epe vs at home, from going vp to <HI>Rome,</HI> the place of the <HI>High Priest;</HI> loe, <HI>Dan</HI> hath b&eacute;ene builded at Yorke, and <HI>Bethel</HI> at Can|terburie. As the vpstart ministry of <HI>Ieroboam</HI> did make their people be|l&eacute;eue,
<PB N="11" REF="13">
that all was naught at <HI>Ierusa|lem;</HI> so this ministry of <HI>Harry</HI> the eight, sowes all false rumors of the holy <HI>Sea</HI> of <HI>Rome.</HI> Stand not (Sir) mazing at the matter. I hated the Church of Rome till now; but the holy Angell no sooner breathed vpon me, but my bowels yearned after her presence, yea, me thought such a light flashed vpom my senses, as therwith|all, all intricate scruples vanished. There was a booke published by <HI>Doctor S.</HI> Hars. concerning falshood of certaine Priests about London, in counterfeiting possessions &amp; dispos|sessions, specially practised vpon the bodies of yong tender damsels. That booke made me loath the holy Priest|hood, as being but false packing com|panions. O sir, I repent my creduli|ty; for new it was reuealed vnto me, that such as came to bee exami|ned, and so deposed by the Prelates of England, they were but such, as sought profits &amp; pleasures, amongst the Protestant Libertines, by so reui|ling the eldest sonnes of their mother.
<PB N="12" REF="14">
Her discipline was too strait for the~.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Malcon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were I assured, that you had such a Reuelation, I could bee contented to reconcile my selfe with you, vnto the Church of Rome.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roma.</SPEAKER>
<P>O sir, must you put your fingers into the wounds, and see also the print therof, before you can beleeue? well, y^e Angel hath told me a secret of yours, vpon the rehearsall wherof, you are to haste~ your soule vnto faith. What if I tell you, what was in your mind, when you were now sl&eacute;eping?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Malcon.</SPEAKER>
<P>That would moue me much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then this; your mind ran of <HI>E|lias.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Malcon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tis very true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roma.</SPEAKER>
<P>And vpon that part of <HI>Elias</HI> his story, wherin he called fire from hea|uen. Why gaze you so at me? Speak, is it not true?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Malcon.</SPEAKER>
<P>True? yea, as true as the Gospell. Now I perceiue that you haue had a Reuelation, and a Reuelation most true. Euen as <HI>Daniel</HI> brought <HI>Nabu|chadnetsars</HI> dreame to his mind; so, haue you brought that into my mind,
<PB N="13" REF="14">
that till now I had forgotten. O man of God, thou art more welcome vnto me, then thousands of gold and of sil|uer. But reuerend father, for so I must henceforth call you.</P>

<P>Good sir, giue me no such title, for if I take titles to my selfe, my Crea|tor will destroy me. <HI>Ego quidem Mi|nimus Seruorum Dei:</HI> the least place in my mothers house, is too good for me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Malcon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well brother, I would intreate you to resolue me of some obiections, that so I may stand firmer in the <HI>Faith.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Set we on forward, and propound what you will, but alwayes with an heart, willing to receiue the truth.</P>

<P>How shall that Action be made good, which commonly is called, <HI>The Gun-powder treason.</HI></P>

<P>Uery well sir, it being but an at|tempt against Heretiques, for main|tenance of the Catholique faith. <HI>Da|uid</HI> slue the Ammonites, for but cut|ting the haire and garments of his seruants; and shall not the <HI>Pope</HI> cut short hereticall princes, for cutting

The <HI>Pope</HI> hath exco~municated and accursed this peo|ple of England for a <HI>Babel</HI> (and the Brownists will witnes that is is a <HI>Babel</HI>) and therefore, as the Psalmist saith of <HI>Babel,</HI> I say of this synagogue of Gospellers, <HI>O worthy to bee de|stroyed: blessed shall hee be that re|wardeth thee, as thou hast serued vs. Blessed shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy children against the stones.</HI></P>

<P>True sir, because in his place, he was but a priuat man. But this o|ther is done by publike authority. Otherwise you fall vpon the rocke of <HI>Anabaptisme.</HI> For they reason thus; Our Sauiour and the Apostles vsed no swords; therefore not to be vsed of

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roma.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is to be denied; for though Christ carried no sword, yet hee al|lowed his successor S. <HI>Peter</HI> to car|ry two; and said that there should be a time to vse them. Now, our holy Father the Pope succeedeth him, so verily as did S. <HI>Peter:</HI> and so the sword Ciuil, and the sword Ecclesia|stique are both in his hands. Now, when we are too weake for them, S. <HI>Peter</HI> and his successor must put vp the sword left they perish with it: but when we are able to ouertop the~, out must the sword; for as the Apo|stle saith, the sword is not carried for naught. O father <HI>Garnet,</HI> father <HI>Gar|net,</HI> how glorious is thy martyr|dome, and how miraculously shineth thy physnomy vpon a strawe!</P>

<P>Your religion, what is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Libert.</SPEAKER>
<P>First, I doe beleeue that there is a God.</P>
<P>Secondly, that his sonne came in|to the world to saue sinners, by suffe|ring in our nature. And S. <HI>Iohn</HI> saith, <HI>Euery spirit that confesseth that Iesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of God:</HI> but I do so confesse, therefore I am of God: So are you, and you, and you, and my hostesse <HI>Blowse,</HI> in so confessing that Iesus Christ is come in the flesh. And therefore lawfull for me to heare Pa|pist, Protestant, Anabaptist or any that so professe. This point I learned of a William, that sometimes liued in Ne|therland; who running from the Eng|lish Church here, to the Brownist; from the Brownist to a particular fa|ction of his owne, wherto he did bap tize himselfe; from that to one sect of the Anabaptists, where they bapti|zed him againe; from that to another sect of the Anabaptists &amp;c, finding no
<PB N="23" REF="19">
rest in any, till hee setled (from that place of S. <HI>Iohn</HI>) to heare all, to walke with all, and to hold all true Christi|ans that confessed Christ as afore.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roma.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Diuell confessed him to bee Christ and the son of <HI>Dauid,</HI> and so to be come in the flesh: therefore you must vnderstand S. <HI>Iohn</HI> better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Libert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yea, these varieties of vnderstan|dings, causeth varieties of sects, and therefore I leaue them to such as loue to contend. Mine Host, <HI>Loue</HI> (as the Apostle saith) <HI>beleeues all things and ex|tends it selfe to all,</HI> as my stomach ex|tendeth to all these dishes, sauing the Smelts.</P>

<P>Hostesse, on the faith of a gentle|man, such things are not vnlikely to be acted of them. I haue seene some of their fashions in my trauels Talk what they shall of religion, when all comes to all, they iump with mee in Religion, excepting their treasons. I will tell you a prety story of some of them, then iudge of their Religion. The Scene of my discourse shall lie at home. In <HI>Wisbich</HI> castle there were many Priests and Friers of sundry fashions; what time the foule railing schisme fell out, betweene the secular Priests and Iesuites. Let these fellowes haue gone to bowles in the castle yard, as viually they
<PB N="25" REF="20">
did; you should haue had some of the~ to play for their <HI>Deuotions,</HI> that is, for so many <HI>Pater-nosters,</HI> so many <HI>Aues,</HI> and so many <HI>Creedes.</HI> If you had asked, how these should haue bene paid? they would haue answe|red; the loser shall pay them on his bare knees. For when he went to say ouer his owne deuotions; then hee was after that, to say ouer so many of the <HI>Paters, Aues</HI> and <HI>Creedes</HI> as hee had lost; and that in the behoofe of y^e winner. This is my tale: now iudge of their religio~: for my part I think y^<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> most of their religion to be but m&eacute;ere|ly <NOTE PLACE="marg">This cau|sed the Au|thor to cast Popery on the left hand, as begetting Liberti|nisme.</NOTE> political, for keeping people in a ti|morous obedie~ce: otherwise, for the learned of them, let them be alone by themselues, they can turne that into gl&eacute;e and gladnes, which the Lay-lort must tremble at in sadnes. <HI>Machia|uel</HI> could well say, that the bringing of people into such seruile feare, it fainted their hearts in fight, wherby the Empire still lessened. But hee should haue further obserued; that howsoeuer it decreased the Empire,
<PB N="26" REF="21">
it was the meanes to strengthen the Popedome.</P>

<P>And whereas they plead <HI>Vnity,</HI> &amp; taxe all other Churches for <HI>Distra|ction;</HI> I protest, a man shall finde more emulations, heart-burnings, vituperies, bloudy practises, amongst them (with mutuall oppositions one against another) then amongst all o|ther Christians in the world besides.

As for the bloody <HI>Inquisition,</HI> they plague all, and all curse them, what shall I say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Malcon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay you haue said enough, and yet but that, which I oft before haue heard. I beseech you sir of your coun|sell: I haue beene one of them, which haue stood heere for the new disci|pline, holding that we haue for po|pish and Antichristian. And seeing this discipline would not be had, I lastly resolued to separate, and so enter into that course, which is called <HI>Brownisme.</HI> As I thus resolued, there comes a booke into my hands, touch|ing <HI>Principles and inferences of a true visible Church.</HI> This booke teacheth a Separation as do the writings of the former: but when he comes to the dis|cipline, he then differs much from the former; and so from the most of our Reformistes, heere at home, so well as from the Church of Scotland and the like.</P>
<P>First we haue held, that the <HI>Pastor</HI> might onely administer the Sacra|ments: but the author of this booke,
<PB N="37" REF="26">
holdeth that the <HI>Doctor</HI> may admini|ster them also.</P>
<P>Secondly, we haue taught, that the <HI>Elders</HI> were to be imploied in Church gouernement onely (I meane in the discipline) but he affirmeth further, that they are all of them <HI>apt to teach;</HI> and so to assist in doctrine.</P>
<P>Thirdly, we haue published, that the Church is to giue the officers their <HI>Calling;</HI> meaning thereby all the men of the Church were to giue their voice: but he intimates further, that women and children are to giue their consent also for such election and calling.</P>
<P>Fourthly, we held <HI>Excommunication</HI> to be the casting out of a contumati|cus person; and that to the excu|tion thereof, there appertained only, rebukes, the word and prayer; as all spirituall: but he infinuates further, that some <HI>bodily punishment also</HI> is to be annexed.</P>
<P>What shall I say? in many things he is crosse to the discipline, which before hath beene applauded: and
<PB N="38" REF="27">
yet the man (they say) an honest man, reuerend and learned.</P>
<P>In the necke of this booke, I met with another, called <HI>Errour on the right hand.</HI> The author thereof being sometimes intangled about <HI>Discipline,</HI> (and yet it must be confessed that ma|ny yeares he hath in print checked ours, for the which we euer caried an hard hand ouer him) and during such time of the entanglement about that point he trauailing into forren parts, and there abiding some yeares (where all sorts of factions were daily in his eies and eares) he, (about some nine yeares since) came ouer, and in Lon|don continuing, hath all this while conflicted with factions, and not a little vexed vs. The foresaid book he <HI>now</HI> publishing, it plainely euinceth, that if separation bee made from the Church of England for An|tichristian, then will ineuitably fol|low an endles wandring from facti|on to faction. These two bookes haue put me to my wits end; I know not what to do: and to subscribe vnto this

<P>Now sir, they can propound no|thing so erroneous and wicked, but it doth agree with some part of Gods word: As for example, if they pro|pound any thing for Christian, which is ind&eacute;ed Antichristian, it doth agr&eacute;e with the <HI>word of prophecy,</HI> who foretelleth that such euils shall be. If they propound obedience to the beast in <HI>Reuelation</HI> the 13. it agrees with the <HI>word of Prophecie,</HI> which saith, such euils shall be propounded; And in such sense you onely subscribe, namely, that all their euill agr&eacute;eeth

with the <HI>word of prophecy:</HI> &amp; not y^<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> you meane, that their euill is good; o|therwise then respectiuely, as it is a fulfilling of the holy <HI>Prophecy.</HI> Muse not at the matter, the case is plaine, the pearle of your meaning is not to be cast before them, no more then <HI>A|braham</HI> would deliuer his <HI>preserua|tiue</HI> meaning vnto the licentious <HI>Pharaoh:</HI> nor Christ would deliuer his <HI>Reseruatiue</HI> meaning vnto them of <HI>Emmaus,</HI> when he looked another way.

yet in the heele of our discourse (let me make my selfe no wiser then I am) I could not collect, what (after the bodies death) became of that soule, except it then entred into some other body, <HI>Uegetatiue, Sensitiue,</HI> or <HI>Rationall.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Atheos.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, ouer while you liue, obserue when he that dilateth vpon an argu|ment, doth insist in his <HI>owne</HI> person, or in the person of <HI>another.</HI> The im|mortality of the soule was mine owne, but the passage of it into some other body, y^e I deliuered in y^e person of another, namely of certaine ancie~t Philosophers very iudicious &amp; lear|ned. And hereto some haue of late the rather inclined, for that these great Polititians which penned the scrip|tures, do call <HI>Iudah</HI> a Lion, <HI>Isachar</HI> an Asse, <HI>Dan</HI> a Serpent, <HI>Herod</HI> a For, with the like, as either ha|uing had the spirits of such beasts within the~, or else, for that their spi|rits were destinated (vpon y^e bodies death) to enter into such Beasts.</P>

<P>Uery true; else how should they giue life to inferiour bodies? <HI>Plato</HI> y^e Philosopher, read him well.

Whereupon else co~meth it, that not|withstanding all sortes of daily dy|ings, there is yet a plentious conser|uation of euery creature in this kind?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Malcon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surely, it must needes bee so. And I now perceiue, that is impossible
<PB N="48" REF="32">
for a man that pores much vpon the Scriptures, should euer bee a wise man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Atheos.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tut, the writers of the scriptures, were very politick men. The sum|mer of <HI>Trogus Pompeius,</HI> notes <HI>Moses</HI> to haue beene a very pollitick Cap|taine, and <HI>Ioseph</HI> a notable Magician, who well knew, that such an itchie people as <HI>Israel,</HI> would neuer be kept vnder, but by propounding some formes of Religion, whereby they might be imbusied in these religious deuotions, as time should not afford, (ouer and besides that) any leasure to looke into their Captaines purposes. Vnto which religion, they being once fashioned, in hope of a reward, at the hands of one they called GOD, they afterwards, neither durst do other|wise, as they would auoid certaine torments, in a place they called Hell. What was it that <HI>Mahomet</HI> else inten|ded in the deuice of his <HI>Alcoran?</HI> And hath hee not thereby, purchased to himselfe abundance of Kingdomes, with subiugation of very many Chri|stians?
<PB N="49" REF="32">
And this the rather, by ob|seruing a want in the others policie, (at least, in the exercise of their poli|cy) when as he leaues no liberty to his people, for calling so much, as any one point of their religion in questi|on, but die therefore he must. Wher|upon followes that differences they haue none; and so are at all times a|mongst themselues vnited, and fit with one heart and spirit, to fly con|fidently in the faces of any their ad|uersaries. Whereas distraction in our policy, weakeneth our affections one toward another; and infirmeth the whole bodie against our forraine Ad|uersary.</P>

I will tell you further, if shee can draw her sting back againe, the~ all is well enough with her, howsoeuer she haue tickled her molestor. But if she leaue it quite behind, then through want of choser to inflame her vnto duty she becommeth a drone and loi|terer, liuing vpon the spoile of others. All which may put vs in mind; First that a Christian is to be zealous in a good cause, but so as he ouershoot not the compasse of his owne good. Secondly that a man ouerlashing in zeale, doth finally grow to be as cold as a clocke, a plaine loiterer, liuing, vpon the vndeserued paines of others: For extremity of zeale, ordi|narily is turned into extreame secu|rity.

<P>Whia, this was an idle b&eacute;e&punc; and seeing shee would not worke (as the Apostle vrgeth) she shall not eate a|mongst them.

Now sir, marke againe how some come forth to fly about for more prouision: Others againe, see how they come with their thighes laden with matter for effecting of hony. And in the third place obserue, how some others help to beare in their burthen. From hence may wee not learne, that as euery Christian is to haue his calling and therein to bee painfull; so, the stronger are to sup|port the weaker, one bearing ano|thers

<P>Now sir, all these maintaine V|nity in the bonds of peace; and so their small beginnings increase to a mightie lump: whereas on the other side, the greatest things by discord and dariance, do come vnto nothing. Furthermore, as they haue a gouer|nor to goe in and out before them, so they do camp round about his person as willing to be slaine before y^<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> their anointed be touched. And may not the obseruation hereof bring confusi|on of face vnto such as not only make away, but also themselues ioyne in traiterous violences against the Lords annointed, our dread Soue|raigne king <HI>Iames?</HI> Besides, how may it plainly demonstrate the leaud spirits of some <HI>Zeloists,</HI> who being called to inuiron the Church, as the Tribes with their tents in the wil|dernes inuironed the Sanctuary, are not onely, not such, but in deede
<PB N="72" REF="44">

of Christ Iesus, exhibite a plen|teous blessing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Malcon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Amen, I beseech him. The first question is, how may I be assured that the ministrie of our Church, is one with that ministry which Christ left vnto the ministration of the new Te|stament, that is, of the Gospel, or glad tidings, through Faith in Christ, op|posite (in respect of the forme of iu|stification) to the workes of the Law. The doubt ariseth; First from their diuersity of titles; the one called Bi|shops and Deacons; the other called Arch-Bishops, Lord Bishops, Priests, Parso~s Vicars. Secondly, our Bishops seemto haue greater dignities &amp; prero gatiues in the world the~ the other had.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Medioc.</SPEAKER>
<P>To the first I answer: The house of <HI>Ioseph</HI> made no separation from their master; nor the Iewes from <HI>Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael</HI> and <HI>Aza|riah:</HI> howsoeuer <HI>Pharaoh</HI> altered the first and <HI>Nebuchadnetsar</HI> gaue bad ones to the second. Names are not of the <HI>essence</HI> or being of things, other|wise, false Christs should bee true
<PB N="74" REF="45">
Christs, and false Prophets, true Prophets, because they be inuested with y^<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> commendable titles of <HI>Christ</HI> and <HI>Prophet.</HI> And yet no such euill in our names, (for what is <HI>Archbi|shop</HI> but <HI>chiefe ouerseer?</HI> Lord Bi|shop, a ruling ouers&eacute;er: Priest (the cor|rupt word of <HI>Presbyter,</HI> as Bishop of <HI>Episcopos</HI>) signifieth onely an <HI>El|der</HI> (which phrases of Bishop and El|der were giuen to the Apostles also) The first in respect of ouerseeing Church or Churches; the second in respect of their yeares sufficiencie, be|fore they entred into the worke of the ministry. As for the terme <HI>Parson,</HI> you may call him <HI>Pastor</HI> if you will (the Law giues you leaue) the terme <HI>Par|son</HI> arguing rather the nature of his <HI>Maintenance,</HI> then of his <HI>Office.</HI> The same may be said of <HI>Vicar</HI> also: and therefore hee that in Lancashire said <HI>God hath giuen me a liuing, and the diuell hath giuen me a name:</HI> ar|gued therein more precipitate zeale then sadnes of learning. I wonder why Phanatique spirits, (so well as
<PB N="75" REF="45">
at this) do not brabble with their Pa|rents for <HI>giuing,</HI> and with them|selues for <HI>bearing,</HI> such names (as <HI>Richard, Robert, Roger, Hercules, Diana, Mar-prelate</HI> (for so one was baptized) and these &amp; thousands moe, be not onely, not in the Bible, but, many of them rapt from heathen Po|ets, &amp; what not? But they haue litle to do, that will contend with their owne shadow.</P>
<P>Secondly for the greater dignities &amp; prerogatiues, which our Bishops haue in the world: I answer, the A|postles had right to far greater dig|nities<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 9. 1. &amp;c.</NOTE> then ours be possessed of, the A|postle had right to euery vineyard<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 8. 20. 21.</NOTE> h&eacute;e planted, to euery flocke hee had fed; and that is, right to maintenance from multitudes of Churches, and countries. If it be replied, y^<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> Apostles had it not, no, not y^<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> Arch-apostle S. <HI>Paul:</HI> I answere, y^<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> was not because it was not their right; but because the people would not giue vnto the~ their right. If here it be obiected, but our Bishops haue not so laboured and
<PB N="76" REF="46">
conuerted y^<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> people from whom they haue such dignities; I answer, the first had to do with meere <HI>Infidels</HI> without the Church, but ours with <HI>Christians</HI> within the visible face of the Church, and therefore no such cause nor n&eacute;ed. But as the Apostles hauing ordained Presbyters (or Priests) to euery Church, for y^<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> n&eacute;ere ouer sight thereof, did notwithstan|ding <HI>care for all the Churches,</HI> and<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 11. 28.</NOTE> visite them as opportunity was of|fred:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 1. 3. Tit. 1. 5.</NOTE> so it is y^<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> duty of ours, and their maine duty. If any one faile herein, <HI>Est quidem error personalis, non le|galis,</HI> the fault is in the person, not in the function confirmed by Law.</P>
<P>As for their <HI>Prerogariues,</HI> what haue they, wherein the Apostles ex|ceeded not?

<P>Indeede sir, I must needes say, it would come to no better. Experience euery where, will giue testimony vn|to it. But I beseech you (sir) another question; how shall wee cleare, that the Surplice is not an Idolothyte?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="79" REF="47">
<SPEAKER>Medioc.</SPEAKER>
<P>By the definition of an Idolothyte: for, an Idolothyte is, whatsoeuer is dedicate or consecrate to an Idoll by way of deuotion: But none of our Surplices haue been so deuoted, ther|fore none of them Idolothytes. If any can fetch out a Surplice, that hath beene by the Papists consecrated to their Idol-idle&punc;masse; such a one may be termed an Idolothyte, and it skils not though it were burnt. As for ours, they be not such, though like to such; no more then the Animal-offe|rings of Israel vnder the lawe&punc; were Idolothytes; howsoeuer like to the oblatio~s of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> out of which they made their exode and passage. But that which is more; if the idolatour had abused it, may I not vse it? The Apostle teacheth otherwise: vnto the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> he layes downe the case<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cor. 10. 23.</NOTE> thus: Of cattle offered vp to the I|dols, some part comes to the offerers; and from them sometimes, that part comes to the flesh market. Some in|fidell buyes of it, dresseth it, and sets it before thee. Let thy co~science make
<PB N="80" REF="48">
no scruple to eate of it, how soeuer it was Idolatrized for as the earth is the Lords (not the Diuels) so, the ful|nes thereof is his&punc; and created for the vse of his. Yet, this <HI>prouiso</HI> withall: If any one at table w^t th&eacute;e, doe pointe at it, and say&punc; certainly this is an I|dolothyte, I like it not; then because of his conscie~ce (not because of thine) let it alone: for the Lord hath things know besides in the earth for thee to feede vpon. Otherwise, thou eating of it and giuing thankes to God for it, why should another speake end of thee? Hence it is plains, that the children of God may lawfully vse a|ny creature in the earth, howsoeuer it haue beene by others prophaned. Only, in case of anothers weaknes, he is to forbeare, euen from his owne right. This <HI>Prouiso,</HI> I know, is the maine of all their speech, who k&eacute;epe such a stir about the poore garme~t: but in pressing this <HI>prouiso,</HI> they must take with them this&punc; they must con|fesse themselues to bee but (as yet) very yong Christians, and not fitted
<PB N="81" REF="48">
to be Pastors ouer flocks of people: no more then they were fit for mini|steriall function, which were but <HI>Ne|ophyts,</HI> newly come from heathe~ I|dolatry vnto Christianity: for, such were they, of whom the Apostle spea|keth. And then it will followe; first, that they haue sinned, in medling w^t the strongest function in the congre|gation, being but as yet nouices in the faith. Secondly, that they de|serue to be sharply censured, for ma|king their people weaker then they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ound them&punc; who at first, could brooke the Garment well, but now must <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span">&punc; as if it were an Ido|lothyte. And if they say, they knowe their owne Christian liberty therein&punc; but many about them will be offen|ded: I answere, there be none about them, that can (as the former <HI>Neo|phyts</HI>) plead tollerable infirmity. All about them be Christians borne, of Christian parents, in the profession of Christianity, for some thousand yeares and vpward. Let them s&eacute;e to it then, if such their exception doe not
<PB N="82" REF="49">
growe; not from infirmity, but from wilful p&eacute;euishnes; as willing to stick, rather in their owne preiudged opi|nion, then to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">eeled forward vnto Christ. With the Apostlo to the <HI>Co|lossians,</HI> I say thus; If they be dead<NOTE PLACE="marg">Colos. 2. 20.</NOTE> with Christ from the ordinances of the world, why, as though they liued in the world, are they burdened with traditions, as touch <HI>not,</HI> taste <HI>not,</HI> ha~|dle <HI>not?</HI> wee say, (to shew the liber|ty wherewith Christ hath made the~ free) they ought to weare it. They answere, that they may <HI>not.</HI> We say, besides the former reason, the Chri|stian Princes commandement (pro|pounding it, but as a garment for seemelines and order) it ought to moue their conscience, to the vse of it. They answere, it doth <HI>not.</HI> Propou~d what we shall, they still with the su|perstitious <HI>Colossians,</HI> doe returne vs a not: as if their only study were, to crosse Christ, to crosse a Christian King, and to crosse the Churches af|firmatiue, with their <HI>Ethelothreskia,</HI> their Negatiue Not.</P>

<P>I wonder, how (reading that place to the Corinths, so often as I haue, so well as this last to the Colossians) I could neuer enter into the Apostles true meaning; which now (after these fewe words of yours) are so plainly e|uident, as the Sunne at Noone-daies. God haue the praise for it. I beseech your patience (sir) a little longer, for my further assurance in the faith.

<P>GOD giue the truth to preuaile timelily with me and all his people.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Medioc.</SPEAKER>
<P>I answere, something in the trans|lation may bee <HI>diuers</HI> to the Origi|nall, and yet not <HI>Repugnant</HI> to the word. <HI>Nam diuersa non sunt opposita.</HI> vnderstand you that?</P>

</SP>

<P>Surely, that must needes bee; else, there will neuer be any vniformity or orderly communion; where euery one shall be left to their owne priuate in|terpretation and meaning.</P>

<P>What should let then, that there cannot bee a subscription to our Church?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>Malcon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because some learned in the to~gues, doe find some wants in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>By that reason, there can bee no subscription to any Translation,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>I</HI> meane, the septua|gint, for the old Testame~t.</NOTE> <HI>Greeke,</HI> Latine, English or any. For what tra~slation (that I say no more) euer <HI>was</HI> there, <HI>is</HI> there, or euer <HI>shall</HI> be, which shall not sauour of mans weaknes?

<P>Then it vnauoidably followeth; y^<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> either subscription is due to euery true Churches translation, or else to none at all. And if to none at all: then much lesse to the Pastors sermons, or to the churches constitutions or Ar|ticles; seeing all these doe depend vpon the iudgement of men also, which haue their wants and Igno|rances.</P>

<P>It must needs be so.</P>

<SPEAKER>Medeoc.</SPEAKER>
<P>This puts mee in minde of one,
<PB N="87" REF="51">
who within these fewe yeares said thus vnto mee: <HI>what if I poue that there is no true bible &amp;c?</HI> God tooke him soone after away, I hope for his owne good; but sure I am, for the Churches good. Good friend, our mother church knowes what shee doth herein; but these excepters are blinde in their manner of exception&punc; leading the high-way vnto <HI>Atheisme</HI> For thus they must argumentate.</P>
<P>No lawfull subscription (in such sort as our Church vrgeth) can bee made to any Translation, in any thing dissenting from the Originall.</P>
<P>But euery Translation in some things dissenteth from the Originall:</P>
<P>Therefore no Translation to be sub|scribed to, as our Church vrgeth.</P>
<P>Then hereupon will followe;</P>
<P>1 No such subscription is due to any Bible, sauing to the <HI>Hebrew</HI> for the Old testament, &amp; the <HI>Greeke</HI> for the newe.</P>
<P>2 These <HI>Not-subscriptors,</HI> besides may ioyne w^t some <HI>Romanists,</HI> &amp; s&eacute;em to haue as lawfull exception against
<PB N="88" REF="52">
the said Hebrue and Greeke also. If they know what I meane in this, the~ let them be ashamed of their ignora~t p&eacute;euishnes. If they know not; then with the Apostle I say, <HI>Let the igno|rant<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 14. 38.</NOTE> be ignorant.</HI></P>
<P>3 (Not to say any thing of our Sauiour, &amp; some others of his Dis|ciples) Then they will bring the cre|dit of S. <HI>Luke</HI> into question; who in|troduceth S. <HI>Stephen,</HI> saying&punc; that 75 soules went downe into <HI>Aegypt,</HI> whereas <HI>Moses</HI> mentioneth only <HI>70</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 7. 14, Genes. 45.</NOTE> soules. Nor can <HI>Beza</HI> deny, but that all Greeke copies hee met with, doe read <HI>75.</HI> As also the Syrian and A|rabian, and the Latine, with <HI>Ierome</HI> and <HI>Augustine.</HI> And herein ind&eacute;ede (to speake only what is probable) S. <HI>Stephen</HI> followed the Greeke trans|lation of the old Testament, called the Septuagint (of the 70, or 72 Rab|bines, that translated it so, at the re|quest of the Egyptian King, <HI>Ptolemy Philadelph</HI>) which translation in our Sauiours time was most vulgar, &amp; best knowne to the Iewes the~selues.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="52">And therfore followed of S. <HI>Stephen:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Master Broughton standeth stifly for this.</NOTE> that I speake nothing of others; nor yet here, what the Septuagint might intend by 75: nor, how in very many places, they differ from the Hebrue.</P>
<P>4 Then neither may there be such Subscription to any Sermons, Arti|cles of faith, Ecclesiastique constitu|tions, Leitourgie or the like. For ma~ failing in his worke, vppon the Ca|non or Rule of faith, then likewise (if not much more) he is like to faile in his maner of building vpon that rule of Faith, yea, not only in <HI>maner,</HI> but in the <HI>matter</HI> also.</P>
<P>5 Then necessarily followeth, that no such subscription is at all to bee made; but euerie mole is left to dig in the earth, as pleaseth his owne blindnes. And in such libertie, they may go shake hands with <HI>Segnior Li bertino;</HI> and of Libertines become <HI>A|theists,</HI> and of Atheists Diuels incar|nate.
