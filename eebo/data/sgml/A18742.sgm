<P>_SOme men (righte Ho|norable) searche many soyles, and trauell very farre, to finde out a pre|tious Iewell or rare de|uise, to presente vnto their friende when they come home. And gayning by their gift and honest intent a thankefull bene|fite and special good turne, makes of their labours a pleasure and co~moditie.

or paynes with my penne could yeeld, can not finde any thing worthy acceptation, where I made promise, and purposed long ago, to offer a presente. And the longer I haue tarried (and looked about me) the worse I am furnished for the answering of my hope, and the lesse able I feele my iudgemente, to performe that I purpose: like a ma~ that would fayne trauell a great iourney, hauing a weake body, and a lusty mind. And before he commes halfe way to the ende of his pilgrimage: his legges waxe lame, and he calleth for his crutche, and yet when there is no remedy, must ei|ther of force hoppe homewarde againe, or hale forward as fast as he may, to come to the knitting vp of his attempted labour. But though with like weakenes my body is discouraged (when the mind glories too muche in his owne strength,) yet another thing comforts me, which may be a great help to my smal ability, &amp; a special cause

<HEAD>Of the Warres and troubles in <HI>Flaunders,</HI> during the raigne of the Emperoure Charles the fifth, and since those dayes a rehearsall of sundrie things, till the late death <HI>of Don Iohn de Austria.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_IN the raigne of y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> mightie Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">th, whose victories &amp; conquests are registred in Chronicle, <HI>Flaunders</HI> did flourishe with Souldioures, abounde in wealth, prospered in w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">r, and wanted neyther wise men to make peace at their aduantage, nor good Go|uernoures, to maynteyne their publike stare &amp; com|mon co~moditie: and yet their Countrey stoode neuer fr&eacute;e fro~ troubles, nor their Townes, Fortes, and fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">tifications coulde any long whyle in quietnesse remayne, the occasion whereof may proc&eacute;ede, eyther of the ambition of this gr&eacute;e|die worlde, or the plagues prepared of God and poured on the people, whose wealth and pride was so great, that they were wart so wanton with abundaunce of treasure, that sometymes they fell to open rebellion, treason, and inso|lencie, and sometime to such disorder of life, as was not to be suffered. For the which cause, the Emperour made in <HI>Gaunt</HI> a great Castel, and kept such a garrison in the same, as might feare the offenders, and animate good subiectes in well doing. So the whole Country of <HI>Flaunders, Braban<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">, Se|land, Holland, Artoys, Henalt, Namure</HI> (and other members
<PB N="10" REF="10">
thereof whatsoeuer) were gouerned by a Regente, called the Qu&eacute;ene of <HI>Hungary,</HI> sister to the Emperoure, in whyche season fell out many matters, but especially suche warres as I meane to make mention of, and ought not to be for|gotten in this shorte rehearsall of the affayres of <HI>Flaun|ders.</HI></P>
<P>Nowe to touche briefelie the broyles and businesse of those dayes, it is to be presupposed, that <HI>Fraunce</HI> hadde a clayme to some partes of the Countrey of <HI>Flaunders,</HI> for whyche clayme or gr&eacute;edie desire of dominion, a most cruell and pitifull warre burst out betweene the Emperoure, and the French King. And continuing long in diuers exploytes and exercises of armes, the King of <HI>Na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">arre</HI> with an ar|mie entred the lowe Countrey (n&eacute;ere vnto <HI>Saint Homers</HI>) burning and spoyling what h&eacute;e thought conuenient, or had by sworde conquered.</P>
<P><HI>Monsieur Grand Maeter,</HI> called <HI>Count Dernes,</HI> dyd lea|uie another power of <HI>Burgonyons, Flemmings,</HI> and Eng|lishmen, and so marched, to withstande the furie of the Frenche, and encamped himselfe n&eacute;ere vnto the King of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> called <HI>Duke de Vandoem,</HI> where was oftentimes hote skirmishes, and good leaping of dikes, the seruice was so well plyed on both the parties. At whyche seruice, were sundrie English bands, and many Gentlemen of <HI>Englande,</HI> as Sir <HI>Anthonie Storley,</HI> Captayne <HI>Matson, Francis Hor|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ey,</HI> Sir <HI>William Drurie,</HI> Captayne <HI>Mitchell,</HI> Captayne <HI>Plonket,</HI> Captayne <HI>Hinde,</HI> my selfe, and a great number of others, whose names I haue forgotten.</P>
<P>This businesse b&eacute;eyng done, and the Frenchmen re|tyred, <HI>Monsieure Grand Maeter</HI> bes&eacute;eged <HI>Hedding,</HI> and battered the Castell, where Duke <HI>Orace</HI> was slayne, and manye other noble men of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> and at length, the Ca|stell and Towne was assaulted, and Captayne <HI>Matsons</HI> Auntiente was the fyrste that entred the Towne (<HI>William</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="10">
<HI>Hinde</HI> bearing it) and gaue the fyrste signe of victo|rie: after whyche Conquest, with the pause of thr&eacute;e dayes aduisemente, the Castell of <HI>Hedding</HI> was y&eacute;elded to <HI>Monsieur Dernes,</HI> and the Frenche Souldyoures marched away with bagge and baggage, to the greate glorie of the <HI>Burgonyons,</HI> and discontentmente of the French.</P>
<P>The Emperoure not long after, wyth a puissante po|wer, and a mightie armye, bes&eacute;eged <HI>Meatz</HI> in <HI>Lorraine,</HI> in whyche Towne was a greate number of the floure of <HI>Fraunce</HI> placed, as Duke <HI>D'Aumail,</HI> Duke <HI>De Namures,</HI> and the <HI>Vidaem de Chartoys,</HI> a lustie and noble Gentle|man, wyth whyche <HI>Vidaem</HI> was the Lorde <HI>Charles Ho|warde</HI> of <HI>Effingham</HI> that nowe is. And the Frenche so wor|thilie behaued themselues in that Towne, (by sallies, and issuing out vppon the Emperoures Campe) that the Emperoure was fayne to rayse hys s&eacute;ege, wyth the losse of twentye thousande menne by Sworde and Pesti|lence, and so departed, and missed the thyng h&eacute;e looked for&punc;</P>
<P>From <HI>Artoys</HI> the meane whyle, <HI>Monsieur Grande Maeter,</HI> with a greate power, wente along the water of <HI>Some,</HI> and spoyled two Townes of good strength, the one called <HI>Noyon,</HI> and the other <HI>Roye,</HI> wyth a number of other Uillages. And in the same iourney, before <HI>Pyroen,</HI> was Sir <HI>William Drurie</HI> shotte through the bridle hande by a Frenchma~, y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> offered to breake a Lance vpo~ him, who threwe downe his staffe when h&eacute;e shoulde haue putte it in the rest, and so discharged hys Dagge at Sir <HI>William Drurie,</HI> whyche was accompted the parte of a Co|warde.</P>
<P>At the same instant, or very soone after, the Frenchmen bes&eacute;eged <HI>Hedding</HI> agayne, where <HI>Monsieur Byron</HI> was, as Generall. His Father <HI>Mon. Grand Maeter</HI> came to raise y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">
<PB N="12" REF="11">
s&eacute;ege with a sufficiente power, but came too late, for the French hadde wonne it the same nyghte that we laye in Campe, within two leagues of <HI>Hedding,</HI> and <HI>Monsieur Byron</HI> commyng away wyth bagge and baggage, sente vs worde of hys misfortune, whyche newes so tooke away the courages of oure people (I meane <HI>Burgonyons,</HI> and suche as were in oure Campe) that we marched without sounde of Drumme or Trumpet that nyght, to <HI>Saint Poule,</HI> a neutre Towne on the frontiers, and the season was then so terrible cold, that all the way we had but Snowe and sl&eacute;ete in oure faces, with suche a winde and blustering storme, as many dyed by the way, and many fell sicke of their suddayne and sore trauell.</P>
<P>H&eacute;ere I must a little tell you of the strange manner of both oure Camps at all times and extremities, whyche in d&eacute;ede was of the worlde to be wondered at: for the French woulde sometimes make hast to followe vs, but when they came n&eacute;ere, then woulde they retyre, wyth as greate ex|pedition, as they made hast before: and in lyke sorte, we followed them vppon the lyke aduantage. But when our Campe came in the smell of theyr Poulder, away w&eacute;e trudged as fast (God knowes,) without any greate occa|sion. And in this trade and manner the whole forces of both the sydes continued a maruellous tyme, and yet assuredlye on both partes were manye stoute and vali|ante Captaynes, and menne of suche fame, as to these dayes there are but a fewe lefte alyue of theyr worthy|nesse.</P>
<P>About this time <HI>Rentie</HI> was besieged, where manye no|ble things were done, so valiantly, and with suche courage and conduct, as merits great praise: but in fine, the French were faine to withdraw themselues, and the <HI>Burgonians</HI> succoured the Fort with no little losse or hazarde.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="11">The greate Citie and Towne of <HI>Arras</HI> had like to haue bin betrayed, but the treason was espied, and the practise preuented, to some losse of the French side.</P>
<P><HI>Monsieur Dernes</HI> dyed, and in his place came <HI>Monsieur Benningcourt,</HI> who, being Graund Maister, prepared to besiege <HI>Dorlean,</HI> and laye neare it with a huge power, the French by a great pollicie, laide an ambushe of horsemen and footmen in a place conuenient, and the <HI>Burgonions</HI> ca|sting no doubt, went about some enterprise, and fell in the lapse of the French, where was a maruellous great fighte and sharpe encounter, horsemen to horsemen, at the leaste fiue thousand on a side, and the <HI>Burgonians</HI> at the first wan a gyddon or two from the French, and tooke manye priso|ners. But in the end, the broile began to be so hote, that the Prince of <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">anoys</HI> was smored to deathe in hys armoure, and the Duke of <HI>Ascot</HI> was take~ prisoner, and the <HI>Burgo|nions</HI> were forced to make the best shift for the~selues that they coulde, at whiche seruice and other exploites before, was Sir <HI>William Drurie,</HI> and moste of the Gentlemen and souldioures of <HI>Englande</HI> before named.</P>
<P><HI>Hedding</HI> was againe besieged by the <HI>Burgonions,</HI> and wonne from the French, and rased to the verye grounde, to the vtter disgrace of the Frenche, and great glorie of the o|ther side.</P>
<P>The Emperoure his owne person, and his sister the Re|gent, came with a wonderfull great armie to <HI>Cambris,</HI> and abode the French Kings co~ming, for a battell. The French King came, and presented the battel, with such a multitude of braue Souldyers, horsemen and footemen, as seldome I euer sawe before, and in d&eacute;ede they marched full in the face and viewe of the Emperours campe, which was so entren|ched, that the French coulde not haue any aduauntage, and so, after the great ordinance had gone off a long season, the Frenche in a moste noble and braue order retired.</P>
<P>A strong and goodly Towne called <HI>Turwaine,</HI> was besie|ged
<PB N="14" REF="12">
by the <HI>Burgonions,</HI> battered and assaulted, at which assaulte we lost many men. But the <HI>Spaniardes</HI> were euen with the towne after: For at a parl&eacute;e, the <HI>Spaniarde,</HI> so|dainely entred the towne, and so a greate murther of all sortes of people was made, in somuche, that I sawe sun|drye wounded and sicke Gentlemen and Gentlewomen, leape downe from the toppe of the walles, but that preuai|led not, for the murther continued, and the towne was cleane spoyled, throwne down, and rased in moste cruell dispite.</P>
<P>There was many other seruices in <HI>Flaunders,</HI> the whiche I saw not at that seaso~, wherfore I do commit the reporte thereof to those that are better experimented with the cau|ses, and haue a minde to set them out at large. For my on|lye meaning was, but briefly to make a rehearsall of suche things as I knewe to be true, and may not wearye a wil|ling Reader.</P>
<P>Nowe after a number of broyles and warlike af|faires were ended, the Emperour and the Qu&eacute;ene of <HI>Hun|garie</HI> tooke shypping, and went into <HI>Spaine,</HI> and ended their liues in a Monasterie, and in <HI>Flaunders</HI> was placed, King <HI>Phillip,</HI> in whose time was many great actes done, and sundry battels worthily gotten.</P>
<P>The greatest of those victories was at Saint <HI>Quintines,</HI> whiche towne King <HI>Philip</HI> besieged.

<P>At this siege was the Erle of <HI>Penbrooke</HI> sent from Qu&eacute;en <HI>Mary,</HI> as Generall ouer fiue thousande Englishemen, and in that company, the Lorde <HI>Grey</HI> of <HI>VVilton,</HI> the Earle of <HI>Leycester,</HI> called then Lorde <HI>Robert Dudley,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Henry</HI> his brother, Lorde <HI>Bray,</HI> Lorde <HI>Delawaer,</HI> Sir <HI>Wil|liam Courtney,</HI> Sir <HI>Iohn Pollard,</HI> and a greate number of nobilitie, and worthy Gentlemen, which being mustred and putte in order of battell on Saint <HI>Peters</HI> gr&eacute;ene by <HI>Cal|lice,</HI> made as gallant a shewe as was s&eacute;ene in those partes a long season before.</P>

<P>The Dutchesse of <HI>Parma</HI> remaining Regent, had much adoe to quiet things in hir time, for the state beganne to be deuided, and a quarrel betw&eacute;ene the Cardinall <HI>Granduiell,</HI> and <HI>Monsieur Degmond</HI> (who gaue the Cardinall a blow) encreased such dissention, as coulde not be a long w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ile b&eacute;e pacified: and then the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> Counte <HI>de Horne,</HI> Counte <HI>de He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">traed,</HI> and others of the greatest calling, ad|uaunced Religion, and brought suche matters in question,

<P>The first of this ruffling and sturre began at <HI>Antwerpe,</HI> where they threwe down Images, and made a greate vp|roare among the common people, so that they fell to sides and factions, and thereby a grudge of ranckor tooke roote in their heartes, in suche sorte, that the one side sought the others ouerthrow and vtter subuersion.</P>
<P>At thys tyme, a greate Citie called <HI>Valentian,</HI> taking holde and sauoure of Religion, reuolted from the Regent, whiche towne was besieged a long season by the Regents power, and by practise and policie surprised, taken, and cru|elly handled.</P>
<P>But in the mean season, there was one called <HI>Monsieur Tolouse,</HI> that assembled a company of souldioures, to the number of two thousand, and fortified a place neare <HI>Ant|werpe,</HI> called <HI>Auste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">uiel,</HI> in minde to exercise Religion there, and to draw as many vnto them, as were fauorers of that enterprise.</P>

<P>The common people of <HI>Antwerpe</HI> standyng on their walles, and beholding this murther and massacre, began to murmure at the matter, and so burst out in open words of malice, and swore to reuenge the bloudshed they be|helde of their brethren and countrimen. Whervpon a com|mon crie was sodain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ly raised throughout the str&eacute;etes, of <HI>Viue le geuxe,</HI> &amp; all the people arming themselues in eue|rye parte of the Citie, came running to the <HI>Mear Broeg,</HI> a wide and large str&eacute;ete, adioyning to the <HI>Borse,</HI> &amp; when they

<P>The people liked no whit that councell, and gaue the Prince euil wordes, and a greate number of them burst in|to my lodging.

<P>At our co~ming in, the prince of <HI>Orange</HI> came to me, &amp; gaue me thankes, for sauing the liues of so many men that had bin abroade, which <HI>Monsieur Beauoys</HI> was like ynoughe to ouerthrowe, bycause he had a great band of horsemen in his campe.</P>
<P>The Regentes power in the market place hearing, that oure men woulde fight, and hadde prepared thinges for that purpose, and s&eacute;eyng oure companye encrease continuallye, stoode in a doubt and durste not issue oute of the market place, whiche was well fortified and guarded rounde aboute with greate chaines and greate p&eacute;eces rammed full of haile shotte, and other mischiefe m&eacute;ete for a murther.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="15">Now I asked of my companie, if they woulde fight, and desired such as would be in their houses to depart, whereat they flang vp a thousande Cappes, and cryed, arme, arme, <HI>Battallia, Battallia, viue le geuxe.</HI> I hearing this crie, and noting their courage, as well as I could, set them in order, and tooke with all possible sp&eacute;ede the high way towards the Market place, willing all those that woulde saue their hou|ses from spoyling, to ayde vs with Munition, and suche things as we wanted.

<P>The day was faire, and the people left in their houses, re|ioyced so at our comming by them, and made such a shoute and crye, that we had good hope of victorie: and to atteyne the same, we marched a great pace, cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ing all the way <HI>Vi|ue le geuxe,</HI> in so muche, that the very noyse of thys crye came to the hearing of the enimie, and neyther Drumme nor Trumpet could be heard of any side, the crye that w&eacute;e made was so greate, (the like of whiche noyse since I was borne I neuer hearde.) And as we approched almost to the mouth of the Cannon, and view of the enimie, the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and all the Nobilitie (to saue bloud, and the liues of thousands) came betw&eacute;ene both the armies, and desired vs to retire, declaring, the enimie was stronger (by meane of their good Souldioures and artillerie) than we: and as he sayde, it was impossible for vs to enter vpon them. At which words, our people fell in so greate a rage, that they cryed, <HI>kill the Prince,</HI> and surely, had not some saued him (I name them not) he had bin slayne. But both the Prince, and a number of the noble men, being frighted with the fu|rious follie of the people, retired so hastilie forwarde, that their Horses fell downe: and the Prince beyng conuayde safelie into another Str&eacute;ete, we tooke the aduantage of time. And making a shew, as though we had ouerthrowne

<P>Nowe hauing this peaceable victorie, we soughte all possible meanes to reste in suretie, and come by that w&eacute;e desired, whiche was (as the people confessed) the libertie of the Gospell. And for oure most aduantage, we tooke wyth vs diuers of the enimies chiefetaynes, and foure and twen|tie Cannons and greate p&eacute;eces, whiche they hadde all rea|die charged, and marching from the enimie, we came to the <HI>Mear Br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">eg,</HI> and there encamped, chayning and choking the corners of euerie str&eacute;ete with Cartes, bigge timber, Barrels, and other necessaries, to holde out the enimie, and to debate the matter at the push of the Pyke, if n&eacute;ede re|quired. And finishing these fortifications, we thrust eue|rie windowe full of shotte that might serue for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">lanc|king of the str&eacute;etes, (and commande the rest of y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> houses in the compasse of our shotte) that nothing might be a lette or hind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">rance to our desired hope.</P>
<P>By this time, the Prince had the keyes of the Towne, and no man coulde eyther enter, or go out, without the li|ce~ce of the people encamped in the <HI>Mear Broeg,</HI> for we kept the watch and ward, and had the only rule of all <HI>Antwerp,</HI> without any empeachment or contradiction.</P>
<P>And aboute midnighte after this victorie, diuers of the Souldioures in greate companyes came vnto me, and de|sired to go and spoyle the Catholikes houses. I tolde them, that it was more m&eacute;ete to watche and be in readinesse for the enimie, for the Prince hadde tolde me, how they pre|pared

<P>The seconde daye, the enimies beganne newe practises, and the Margraue and <HI>Burgo</HI> maisters went busilie about some mischiefe towards vs, and deuised many wayes how they mighte weaken our power, and augment their owne strength, and had secret communication with many of our camp (who were rich men of the Towne) to bring to passe the effect of their deuises.</P>
<P>Aboute dinner time, I being with the Prince at the Table, the people had broken into the Friers, and spoyled their house, which was a beginning of a bloudie businesse, had it gone forward. The Prince hearing thereof, sent me to pacifie the hurly burly, and I came, when sixe Friers were going to hanging, and the people were determined to kill all the Papistes in the Towne, especially the Priests, Monckes, and Friers: but I persuaded the people to be in quiet, and preserued the liues of the Friers, and thousands of their betters, both honest Gentleme~, and wealthie Bur|geses. The same nighte, the rudest, and most disordred of al our company, came in a great heate, and told me, that in one <HI>Battes</HI> his house, an Englishman, was a great flocke of Friers and Religions persons, and all the treasure that they could gather and bring: but by this time had a practise of the <HI>Burgo</HI> Maisters take~ such place, that I was fayne to k&eacute;epe watch all the night, with all the armed men, &amp; chiefe

shotte in our Camp, and yet cleane againste oure hope; dy|uers of our people were fledde from vs to a contrarie side.</P>
<P>Then I was sent to the Prince from our people, to de|maund what was the meaning of these matters, for he had daylie conference with the <HI>Borgo</HI> Maisters, and others, a|bout a common quietnesse (which our rude and basest sorte of Souldioures vnderstoode not.) And the Prince to my de|maunde aunswered some what sharplie, and declared, that the <HI>Calui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">stes</HI> had sworne to kill the <HI>Martinistes,</HI> whyche he would not suffer, and by the threatning of himselfe to his owne face the firste daye, he smelled some suche smoke as woulde breede a furious flaine of fire. Wherefore he willed the people to vse more temperance, and shew more fidelitie and seruice to God and his person.</P>
<P>This message so vered the vayne heads of numbers in our Camp, that they determined to the last droppe of their blouds to maynteyne their purpose for their liues and li|bertie. And the grauest and wisest sort, who were of great wealth and experience, confessed openly, that the brute rai|sed, for the killing of the <HI>Martinistes,</HI> was a deuice of some diuelishe inuention, to set br&eacute;ethren at variance. But in a little while after, our company grewe so weake, that w&eacute;e were but fift&eacute;ene thousand left, of fiue and twentie, whych fift&eacute;ene thousand were become so resolute, that they purpo|sed the nexte morning to giue all their enimies a battell, and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">are, neither to spare one nor other. And in this heate and furie, they badde me looke to my promise, and k&eacute;epe my faith, for they doubted not, but God would giue them vic|torie, for their quarrell was onely for the aduancemente of Gods glorie and hys word.</P>
<P>The next day, the enimies grew very strong, what with <HI>Spanyards Easterlings, Burgonions, Almaynes,</HI> and <HI>Marti|nistes,</HI> the str&eacute;etes were all couered with their assemblyes. And we hearing they were sparckled abroad, and without

order, suddaynely we thought to charge them: and so put|ting our selues in battell, began to march: the brute where|of so amazed the enimies, that they caused the Prince to send and stay vs, and that they were glad to talke of peace, and would not any way offend vs, the Prince sent. Wher|vpon we stayed, and I was agayne sent from the people to the Prince, to will all our aduersaries immediately to lay downe weapon, and goe home to their houses, for otherwise there was no hope of peace. The Prince willed me to per|suade them to goe home first, and promised that all the Ci|tie should be in quiet, so soone as they were in their houses: to the which I replyed, and sayd, that our people were now able and strong ynough to debate the matter in any maner of sort, and being in their houses, and the enimie in armour, the suretie of our people mighte be doubtfull. And I knew I shoulde but offend the people, to bring them newes, that they must giue place to their enimies, when they were maisters of the Towne, and the enimie scattered abroade, and not like to be in order, if we tooke the aduantage that God had put into our hands. Wherfore in hast there was no more to be saide, but eyther the enimie must defend &amp; fight, or without delay withdraw themselues home ward, and let them vse victorie that gat it.</P>
<P>The Prince gaue no aunswere to this, and our men hal|led me away, that were sente to the Prince with me. And when I came to the people, there was a new crye, <HI>Viue le geuxe, Battailia, Battailia,</HI> and suche a shoute and noyse was suddaynely raysed, as made y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> enimie afrayde and trem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">le, and the whole Towne to draw to some accorde and pacifi|cation. And in greate post hast came a messenger from the enimies, that they woulde lay downe weapon, and agr&eacute;e, that there shoulde be a fr&eacute;e libertie of Preaching, and no person shoulde (of this our assemblie) be troubled, for anye matter or cause co~mitted. And to performe this that the enimies offered, they promised to sweare on a Bible, and
<PB N="34" REF="18">
so they did, at which othe and offer our people reioysed, and clapped handes, but still they manfullie stoode in order of battell. The enimies duly obserued the appoyntme~t made, and went euery man to his lodging, accordingly as the or|der was taken, and when we sawe and found all things in quiet, we marched along the str&eacute;etes with Anciente dis|played, and as euery man came by his owne house, he en|tred. But before we wer all placed in our lodgings, it grew very late. Thus ended this greate reuolte, without bloud|shed or hurte to any one person liuing. And for our paynes, and true performance in things that we promised, we rea|ped trouble and persecution: and in a little season after, both Prince and people were driuen through a thousande hazards, to saue life and libertie. The Prince was fayne to depart to a Towne of his owne called <HI>Breda,</HI> and hauing hast away (or for some great cause) left his sonne and heyre called <HI>Monsieur Debuer</HI> in <HI>Louaine</HI> at Schole: and dyuers Gentlemen shifted away as they might: among the rest I seambled hardly into <HI>Englande,</HI> being layde for, and yet so desguised, that I escaped the handes of my enimies, who hadde a commaundement from the Regente, to put m&eacute;e to death with Martiali law (a badde recompence for so great good and diligence bestowed on hir people, and a naughtie reward for the frute of a good meaning mind.)</P>
<P><HI>Flaunders,</HI> and all the lowe Countreys belonging to the King of <HI>Spayne,</HI> after this time, fell in a maruellous mislike of King <HI>Philips</HI> friendes, and so to bridle that Countrey, and k&eacute;epe the people in awe and feare, were appoynted streighte lawes, and seuere Gouernoures.

<P>The Spanyards, as maysters and rulers of all Fortes, Townes, and strong holdes, prospered in wealth, brauerie, and benefite, and became so hauty and stoute, that neyther <HI>Burgonion</HI> nor <HI>Flemming</HI> durst struggle with them, in a|me sort or manner: by whiche meanes, the people murmu|red, and thought all amisse, but knew not how to amend a|nye p&eacute;ece thereof.

And in that kinde of seruitude the poore Coun|trey continued a long season.</P>
<P>Upon the mislike of some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ractions, and other streyghte handlings, there grewe a grudge and a common hatred a|mong the people agaynst the Spanyards, but they were so hardly held &amp; looked vnto, y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> both their power fayled to an|swere their mindes, and their courage was daunted, and could do nothing in recouering their former liberties and priuiledges belonging to their state. Then diuers fledd&eacute; from their patrimonies and liuing, and came to the Count <HI>Lodwike,</HI> who hadde gathered a good power, and lay in <HI>Freeseland</HI> to anoy the Spanyards, and wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e a Towne called <HI>Groening.</HI> And this vali&aacute;t Earle had many followers and fauourers, and many times wanne of the Spanyards, and put the~ to the foyle. But in conclusion, his people b&eacute;e|ing not all sound (nor so desirous to sight as they were wil|ling to haue warres) in a maner at a great extremitie and pushe of seruice, for sooke their noble Captaine, &amp; cowardly behaued themselues, when valiancie should most haue bin s&eacute;ene, and force of manhode &amp; sword might by fortune haue gott&eacute; great victory. In which ouer sight &amp; f&eacute;eble spr&eacute;ete of y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> <HI>Almaynes,</HI> the Counte <HI>Lodwike</HI> was put to flight, all his pow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">r eyther ouerthrowne or dispersed, and he himselfe

<P>The <HI>Spaniardes,</HI> as occasion fell out, on this victorie (be|sides the other greate hopes they had) waxed some what more stoute than they were wont to be, and hauing the brydle caste on their neckes, (and holding the bitte in their t&eacute;eth) ranne what course they thought conuenient, not fea|ring the myre that a headstrong horse mighte happen in, nor suspecting any danger that ouermuch libertie myghte bring them to, fell after in a mischeuous Labyrinth, and could not get out of the same, since that present time, to this day, as h&eacute;ereafter in playne discourse shall app&eacute;ere.</P>
<P>Nowe the Countrey of <HI>Flaunders,</HI> perceyuing that the <HI>Spaniardes</HI> soughte not to preserue the people thereof, nor vse anye meane to encrease credite, and continue in good li|king, and finding (as they thought) those that should haue proued guides and shepeheards, became Wolues and spoi|lers of their common wealth, the willing obedie~ce of thou|sands grew to a common contempt and wilfull stubborn|nesse, and fewe was the number were lefte willinglye to obey the Duke of <HI>Aluaes</HI> direction, and new deuised orders that the straungers had offered them.</P>
<P>So some ran to y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> some sled to <HI>England,</HI> (and that in greate numbers) some slypped into <HI>Fraunce,</HI> and some were readye to tourne any way, and goe where For|tune assygned them.

<P><HI>Flaunders</HI> and all the lowe cou~trie being in this perplexi|tie, began to decline and waxe f&eacute;eble, both of force and cou|rage:

the souldioures little set by: their marchaunts despised: and their noble men so daunted (by meanes of the pride of the <HI>Spaniarde,</HI> and plague of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">nquisition) that they thou|ghte themselues rather in a slauishe bon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">age, than handled like subiectes: and woulde haue faine shaken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">st the yoke of this seruitude, but their power was so small, and their mise|rie so greate, that little or nothing at all coulde they doe, and were forced to beare and su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">er with patience, a burthen most heauie, and a loade that ouercharged both bodye and conscience.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> hauing hope, that sundrie of the towns and str&eacute;ets of the Countrey, in this extremitie would haue ioyned with him (for the recouering of their libertie and priuiledges) drewe himselfe among his friendes in <HI>Ger|manie,</HI> and practised for money and men to be ready with an army to encounter the Duke of <HI>Alua,</HI> and either by battaile to ende tho miseries of <HI>Flaunders,</HI> or by strong hande to driue oute the perturbers of their publske state and quietnesse.</P>
<P>And so resolued to trie, what good fortune, and fast friends woulde doe in those affaires. He remained at his house (ten Dutche leagues beyonde <HI>Collen</HI>) called <HI>Dille<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">burgh,</HI> a goodlye seate, and a faire strong Castell, to which place repaired ma|ny noble personages of <HI>Germany</HI> and Capitaines of greate conduct and charge, to deuise and talke of matter conuenient for the purpose rehearsed. In whiche communication was concluded, that as soone as an army mighte be leuied, they woulde m&eacute;ete and assemble at an Abbey neare vnto <HI>Ander|nake,</HI> which Monasterie was beyond the riuer of <HI>Rhein,</HI> and stoode wel for the suretie of the people that there should be mustred.</P>
<P>It came well to passe after a long prouision, and that a braue regiment of Frenchmen were readye (that <HI>Monsieur Maulberg</HI> brought out of <HI>Fraunce</HI>) that the Prince &amp; his peo|ple met &amp; assembled at this Abbey, in such warlike sorte and order, as gaue a great hope of some high attempt and enter|prise.

For in verie troth, the Counte <HI>de Hostraet,</HI> a noble worthye manne, the Counte <HI>Lodwike</HI> a moste valiaunte souldiour, were come to the Prince, and brought with them a great bande of <HI>Burgonions</HI> of great and good houses, and suche as hadde bin well experimented in wars.

<P>The Prince hadde prepared so great a treasure, that im|mediatly after the army was mustred, there was a generall pay for two moneths, and out of hande order was taken for to passe ouer the great riuer of <HI>Rhein,</HI> not far from <HI>Andernak,</HI> the towne being gladde to stand as our friendes, and aide vs with all that they might.

<P>After this, we encamped before <HI>Ayex Ocorken,</HI> where commonlye the Emperoure is crowned, a greate Cittie not very farre from <HI>Mastricke,</HI> the people wherof did feare to be besieged, and so with a great summe of money red&eacute;e|med their towne.

<P>The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> vsed here a noble policie: firste h&eacute;e sente to the Bishop of <HI>Leeg,</HI> willyng hym to let his armye passe through the Citie of <HI>Leeg,</HI> promising to passe quietly&punc; the Bishop being wylie, sente the Prince worde, that he would make a bridge by the Citie, for the army to passe o|uer at, and made the Duke of <HI>Alua</HI> pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">uy to hys practise, who should haue bin on the other side of y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> water with his armye, to haue receiued our people.

And when oure people beganne moste to doubte some danger, &amp; talked of the hazard, the Prince caused our army to turne their faces, (&amp; by that time night approched) and hauing good guydes, we marched swiftly without making

<P>Nowe after this labour, we tarryed ouer long to refresh the army, for thr&eacute;e dayes were spent in ydlenesse, in which time, the enimies heade and body was occupied, lyttle to oure aduantage: yet the thirde daye we marched full vp|on the enimyes campe, whiche daye was so cleare, and the countrey so plaine to marche in, that all the order of oure campe mighte be throughlye discerned.

But the Duke hadde entrenched his Campe so stronglye rounde aboute, that oure horsmen could not gyue a charge.

augmented continuallie, and plyed the seruice, in such sort, that the enimies perforce were driuen into their mayne battel. But this bickering endured so long, that the day was farre spent, and numbers of oure men were hurte. A|mong the chiefe a noble man (and a speciall sparke of life) called the Count <HI>De Hostraet,</HI> was shotte through the legge, of whych wounde, after he dyed.

<P>Now what should more be sayd of this matter, but that the Duke in this mean season had conuayed fiue thousand shotte (the leading whereof hadde <HI>Iulian Romero</HI>) to the bridge and strayte passage, not farre from <HI>Tillemont.</HI> And this <HI>Iulian,</HI> as he was a maruellous valiant and good soul|diour, of greate experience, fame, forwardnesse, and anti|quitie, so did he so cunningly in a woodde at this presente lay an ambushe, that it was to be wondred at: the manner whereof followeth.</P>
<P>First, when he came to this strayte, he caused the <HI>Spa|nyardes</HI> (which in good sooth were noble Souldioures, and resolute men) to lye flatte on their faces, and as closely as could be deuised, withoute making brute or businesse: and commaunded, that no one man shoulde be so hardie as to stirre, til he gaue a warning and watchworde.

<P>The Prince hauing a minde and good occasion to passe this straite before the night came on, marched towardes the brigge, and all the way the Duke wayted on him, ma|king many offers to haue giuen battell: and still greate

And this <HI>Almayne</HI> shotte were so carelesse, that as soone as they came into the woodde, they lay loking ouer a high dyke, how the Princes cariages, stragglers, vangarde, mayne battell, and wings thereof should passe ouer the bridge, and had no further con|sideration, but gazed before them, when behind their backs the enimie was priuilie placed. Well, in fine, the Prin|ces power came on, and the artillerie, the stragglers, the cariages, the vangarde, the mayne battell, and all, sauing the reregard, passed ouer the bridge, but the reregarde, bycause it was nexte the Duke, and in danger to be sette vpon (by the Dukes power) was double garded with horse|men, besides the ordinarie bandes it was wonte to haue. And further, the vancurrers, and gallantest Gentlemen of person and manhoode, attended on the reregard, to s&eacute;e the ende of the matter. And so soone as the reregarde came be|tw&eacute;ene the two wooddes, the <HI>Spanyardes</HI> did shewe them|selues suddaynely, with suche a terrible shotte and thunder, of Muskette, and Calyuer, that the <HI>Almaynes</HI> by terror of the same, flang downe theyr p&eacute;eces, and woulde haue fledde, but most of them were immediately spoyled and flayne.</P>
<P>The Horsemen of the reregarde were so amazed at thys aduenture, that they scarce knewe what was best to b&eacute;e done: yet in conclusion, a noble Captayne, called <HI>Rides,</HI> and diuers other bands of <HI>Swarfe Rutters</HI> wh&eacute;eled about, made head to the enimie, and were readie to giue a charge on Captayne <HI>Iulian.</HI> And albeit a greate dyke was a lette for the charge, yet the <HI>Rutters</HI> scambled ouer the same, and as
<PB N="47" REF="24">
they myght, in the woodde, slewe diuers of the <HI>Spanyardes.</HI> But the Duke plyed the matter so sharply vpo~ the backes of the reregarde, that <HI>Monsieur Maulberg</HI> (a Baron, with a regiment) and most of his band of braue French Souldi|oures, were put to the sword, or drowned, and many <HI>Bur|gonyon</HI> Gentlemen and Souldioures of all sortes were likewise slayne or ouerthrowne in the water: in whyche conflict, we lost foure or fyue thousand men. But the Prince beholding this murther, and in danger of the shotte conti|nually, was dismayed no whitte: for being on a high ground, ful before the Dukes Camp, he sente downe suc|coures to hys people, and bent all his great Ordinance vp|pon the Duke, and stayed his whole straggling armie in the very view and shotte of the enimie, a thing most rare and strange to be s&eacute;ene.</P>
<P>The Dukes power, as they mighte notwithstanding, followed victorie, and till the darke night did separate the armies, the shotte on both sides neuer ceassed. And looke what prisoners the Duke did take, before the day went out of the Skye, he caused them to be burnt all togither in one house, the smoke and smell whereof came with the winde full into oure noses. Thus we encamped in that presente place, hoping for a reuenge the next morning, at whyche season was <HI>Monsieur Ianlees</HI> to come oute of <HI>France</HI> to the Prince, and with him two thousande Horse, and four thou|sand footemen.</P>
<P>The Duke hearing of <HI>Monsieur Ianlees</HI> commyng, wente to m&eacute;ete hym, but woulde not encounter hym that tyme, bycause the Princes Campe was so n&eacute;ere. And <HI>Monsieur Ianlees</HI> came ouer the water at <HI>Namure,</HI> where the garrison resisted him to theyr po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">er, and lost a hun|dreth or fourescore Souldioures at that tyme. <HI>Ianlees</HI> en|tring with bloud, marched forwarde brauely with hys little Campe, in the whyche h&eacute;e hadde fyue good p&eacute;eces of artillerie. And at length he came in the view of the
<PB N="48" REF="25">
Duke of Aluaes Camp, and being resolued to fight, rather than retire, he put his power in battell, and tooke the nexte way to the Prince, in most manly manner, as ind&eacute;ede h&eacute;e was a stoute Gentleman. The Duke s&eacute;eing his boldnesse and courage, gaue him the looking on, and let him passe, and so our Camp and his ioyned togither.</P>
<P>Upon <HI>Ianlees</HI> comming, who broughte a maruellous gallant companye (of Gentlemen, &amp; experimented Souldi|oures) it was thought, that without delay we should haue soughte out the Duke, and haue giuen him battell: and in that minde was oure whole power many a long day, but what was the occasion to the contrarie, I knowe not, and what did k&eacute;epe vs asunder so long, dothe passe the reache of my reason. A w&eacute;erysome time in this sort poore Souldiours turmoyled, who were visited with so many wants &amp; extre|mities, that it would haue pitied any Christians heart and minde to consider of: yet the willingnesse of people to doe some worthy acte or enterprise, tooke away a p&eacute;ece of the heauie burthen, and made the fardell of affliction the ligh|ter to beare, and the lesse repined at: and it was a miracu|lous matter, for men (as some may alleadge) to liue with|out bread, b&eacute;ere, ale, or wyne, so great a time as we did: for most certaine, the scarcitie was such of the same, that some in the Campe (and right good men) for the space of twentie or thirtie dayes, neuer tasted of bread, nor dranke better than water: yet what with Apples, and frute, and other moyst things we found, the Camp was satisfyed, and men (in hope of better sustenance) shifted out a sorowful season, and nothing gr&eacute;eued their heartes more, than that they cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">d not end or ease that miserie with y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> hazard of battell.</P>
<P>Nowe when necessitie compelled the Prince to wyth|draw his power, or desperate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ie to set on the enimies camp in a fixed determination, he sought daylie after the Duke of <HI>Alua,</HI> who still auoyded the fight.

(that the Horsemen myghte charge them.) The Prince marched towards <HI>Leeg,</HI> and bes&eacute;eged that great and goodly City, although the <HI>Rutters</HI> stiffely refused that seruice, say|ing, it was imperiall, and a Towne they ought not meddle withall. But fro~ whe~ce that reason was racked, or wher|of that answere did smel, I report me to those that knowes the handling and scanning of such cunning mysteries.</P>
<P>The Cannons were planted, for all this contradiction, and the greate p&eacute;eces did play vpon the Citie two or thr&eacute;e dayes, and the Duke hearing thereof, came (as it was re|ported) to set on some of the Princes people and forces. The Prince hauing examined a prisoner that was taken at that present, &amp; vnderstanding where and which way the Duke might be found, sent for his chiefe Captaines, &amp; commaun|ded anone after midnight, to dislodge quietly without sou~d of Drumme or Tru~pet, &amp; march (as they might) towards the Duke: albeit the night was darke, and the weather in|constant, which was a great trouble to the Camp, yet the Prince was resolued to trie out by aduersitie, whether the Duke or he had the more hard destiny and aduerse fortune. Nowe the Souldioures beganne to reioyce, and although the way was combersome, and the nighte darke and vn|comfortable, yet euery man bore a portion of the trauell, in hope to come quickly to an end of the trouble. And by my troth, the maner of our march was so difficult and strange, (and y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> Camp went so scattered abroade at all aduentures) that we were like ynough before day to be some of vs t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">nne mile asunder, or to happen in the hands of the Duke of <HI>Al|uaes</HI> watch vnawares, and so we did: for some taking the <HI>Rutters</HI> (that the Duke had) to be our men, and mistaking the way they should haue kept, fell in the middle of y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> Duke of <HI>Aluaes</HI> centinell, but they were but a few that so foolish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">y wandred. Yet by this blind occasion, the Duke gat lightof the Princes purpose, and thereon entrenched himselfe and his Camp in a strong ground, to his greate suretie and ad|uantage.
<PB N="50" REF="26">
And at the breake of day, our Camp bega~ ch&eacute;ere|fully to sounde a marche, full in the hearing of the Dukes power. I doubt, if I made mention of the mirth that oure people had, some fyne fellowes woulde scarcely bel&eacute;eue it: wherefore I proc&eacute;ede to my matter.</P>
<P>The Campes thus being n&eacute;ere togither, were both in order of battell, the Dukes entrenched, and the Princes in open playne: and the Princes power presented the battell in a braue and goodly order, but it was refused.

And the Duke min|ding to shew some rescue to the Towne, came in the sighte of our Camp, and lodged betw&eacute;ene two great wooddes. Yet nothing worthy noting was attempted.

<P>The whole Countrey through, was so farre out of quiet, that y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> Duke not only fylled the new Citadell in <HI>Antwerpe</HI> with Souldiers, but lykewise, put great garrisons in all places &amp; Townes of strength, whych garrisons peraduen|ture behaued themselues not so well towardes the people, as they looked for.

those that were disturbers of his state. Yet suche broyles were abroach, as coulde not be remedyed without muche bloudshed, and hardly that way, as experience in processe of tyme did declare.</P>
<P>Now in the heate of this murmuring, an infinite sort of scattered people drewe to the Counte <HI>Lodwike,</HI> and many made sute to the Prince, to steppe in and thruste out stran|gers, especially <HI>Spaniardes,</HI> that then were generally des|pised.

<P>Nowe the towns in <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> began to bende apace, to be at y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> Princes deuotion, and the Prince hadset oute a number of Shyppes, whyche often encountred their enimyes, and wanne greate and riche prizes, and seldome loste anye thing, but still foughte it oute so valiauntlye, that victorye s&eacute;emed to be theirs by inheri|taunce.</P>
<P>A fl&eacute;ete of Shippes came from <HI>Spaine</HI> to the Dukes aide, and some of the beste of them happen into the Flushingers handes, commyng into the Hauen, whiche shippes were fraught with treasure, that serued the Princes turne a long time after The Counte <HI>Lodwike</HI> had done verye greate things in sundry enterprises, and seruice of no little charge and hazarde, and was like to proue the oddest Souldier of a noble man in his dayes: but the Duke did alwayes so

pursue him with a great power, and great practises, that he could not, nor was not able, to preuent the Dukes pollici<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s and Stratagemes.

<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> many times came n&eacute;ere to <HI>Flushing,</HI> &amp; the English ba~ds met them often, betw&eacute;en whom was diuers hote skirmishes, &amp; couragious encountre: &amp; albeit that the English deserued muche praise for their forwardnesse, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were not behind in any forward seruice, or stri|uing for fame &amp; place: for at euerye m&eacute;eting, the <HI>Spaniarde</HI> both in nimblenesse &amp; stoute behauior s&eacute;emed often to want neither agilitie, courage, nor conduct: &amp; the Gentlemen and old soldiors of them, durst<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">tug and wrastle for the maistery with any one that they encountred, as our wise &amp; stout sol|diors gladly do confesse, &amp; thinke it a greate iniury, to haue a stoute enimy any way euil spoken of.</P>

<P><HI>Harlam</HI> being a place of strength, somewhat by nature thorow the mean of water (&amp; other causes a fortresse requi|reth) was manned &amp; furnished with most assured souldiers.

<P>In thys wandring sorte of disliking, and vncertaine manner of suretie, the poore and common people were cary|ed aboute with suche a multitude of miserable conceites, that they knewe not to whome to complaine, nor vnto what piller they shoulde leane, and in a manner were rea|dye to sincke and drop downe, vnder the masse of mischief, that lay as heauy as lead on their shoulders.</P>
<P>The Duke <HI>de Terra Noua</HI> no lesse troubled in iudge|ment (for the dischardge of his care and aucthoritie) was often times not well in health, and so consuming some yeares in dooyng what he determined, at length he gaue ouer hys lyfe, and <HI>Flaunders</HI> remained a season withoute anye strange Gouernoure, albeit molested, (as the people thoughte, not a little) with the <HI>Spaniardes,</HI> whiche of all griefes, did moste gripe them, and gladdest they were to be cased of.</P>
<P>And to bryng to passe some greate matter, and to be dischar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ged of thys their daylye sorrowe and continuall clogge, the States in companies as their mindes were bent and sauoured that faction whyche wroughte agaynst the <HI>Spaniardes</HI>) dydde deuise and talke of the recoueryng of their liberties. And for the attayning of the same, they
<PB N="59" REF="30">
pollitiquelye layde a playne plotte, and swore among themselues&punc; to performe euery point and p&eacute;ece of theyr pur|pose.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniardes</HI> both by outwarde countenaunce and bending of browes, perceiued there was some priuie pra|ctise a working, and prepared to withstande it by all the meanes possible mighte be deuised: and k&eacute;eping close their owne councell, concluded, that when occasion came, they woulde putte in execution the matter they hadde treated of, and all the meane whyle they furnished themselues wyth euerye thing fitte for their purposed deuice.</P>
<P>The contrarye parte casting no perill, and standyng too muche to the opinion and bayne hope of a multitude, wente openly about their businesse, and assembled of their friendes a greate companye togither, able with good go|uernement to haue gyuen a battell: whiche band and care|lesse company lay in <HI>Antwerpe,</HI> solacing themselues, and making good ch&eacute;ere, as al things should haue gone with the~ according to their wish.</P>
<P>But euen as those people that <HI>Samson</HI> destroyed amidde their banquets and feasting (smarting himselfe with com|mitting the murther) or rather like wilfull weaklings &amp; wanton children that neuer tasted the strength of a man, bel&eacute;eues, that blunt wasters wil byte like sharpe weapo~s, and so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">unne on heade to their owne harmes, and behaue themselues so carelesly for the combate, that one man well aduised, shall beate a hundreth of those harebraines.

<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> wisely and warily (but sure about a blou|dy and cruel act) came as closely as they could, togither into

the Castell of <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">twerpe</HI> (whiche the Duke of <HI>Alua</HI> caused to be builte) and there consulted quickly on the thing they hastily went aboute: and making no more adde, but ei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">er to kill or be killed, aboute dinner time when some haue more mind of their belly, than their safetie (and fall to quaf|fing and bibbing, when greedie hunger and thirste shoulde be moderated with sober diet) the <HI>Spaniardes</HI> issued furiou|slye into the Citie, into whiche the greate Cannon shotte came roaring before them, and with them came suche a thunder of harquebuzers, and trampling of horses, that the Towne thoughte, that Hel hadde b&eacute;ene burste open, or that the skies hadde fallen vppon them by some sodaine rattle aud thunder-cracke from the Heauens. But well away, manye a sily soule by this bloudye bargaine were sente vnto Heauen or Hell, and the simple people that trusted to the wisedome of their leaders, fell all by their owne follie to the mercie of the <HI>Spaniardes,</HI> whyche are not igno|rant in the vsage of victorie, nor ouer-mercifull till they finde themselues Maisters of the fielde, and in secure and peaceable estate.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>Antwerpe</HI> was throughlye spoyled, and in ma|nye places burnte and defaced, where the <HI>Spaniardes</HI> founde suche a deale of golde and treasure, as hath not bin possessed by one spoile in anye two Townes these manye hundreth yeares: and there was taken prisoner, the young Counte <HI>Degmond,</HI> with some others of good reputation: a warniug to all wanton Cities, hereafter to giue and k&eacute;epe better watche of their libertie and wealth, and to cause the inhabitants of euerye Towne and Corporation, to haue suche regarde of God, and the leading of their liues, that they come not into the indignation of the highest, who of|ten doth visite the base conditions of the people, with sword, fire and pestilence, and manye other punishementes and plagues, that oure present daies doeth present vs, and the worldes wickednesse cannot shunne.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="31">It is to be thought, while these things were a doyng, y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> <HI>Don Iohn de Austria</HI> was drawing hymselfe towards <HI>Flaunders:</HI> but as it fell out by matter that followeth, a ve|rie fewe of good calling in the state were willing to receiue him, especially willing to be gouerned with a straunger, or stande any way pleased with the <HI>Spanyardes</HI> in the lowe Countrey.

<P>The comming do~wne of <HI>Don Iohn</HI> to the low Coun|treys, made the <HI>Spanyards</HI> looke for some succoure, and mo|ued the people of <HI>Flanders</HI> to thinke and looke of other ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">|ters, and in a while they openly published, that they coulde not abide the behauiour of strangers, and woulde not per|mitte any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">o to enter and gouerne, before the <HI>Spanyardes</HI> wer e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">pulsed or drawn by the King from their territories, offering all obedience and duties to the King of <HI>Spayne</HI> their Maister, if the <HI>Spanyardes</HI> and strangers were taken from the~.

with his regiment of Scottishmen, had suche a hande ouer the <HI>Spanyards,</HI> as they no whit liked, and yet they as|saulted the Scottishmen, whiche at that time were but ill prouided. All this season, and a long whyle before, was the right Honorable Maister Doctor <HI>Wilson</HI> (now Secretary to the Qu&eacute;enes Maiestie) Lorde Embassador in <HI>Flanders:</HI> and two seuer all times was sent in Embassage thither, at that time, the Captayne of the Ile of <HI>VVight,</HI> called May|ster <HI>Edward Horssey,</HI> for to make peace, and for suche cau|ses as pleased our Prince.</P>
<P>Embassadors were sente thither from the Emperoure, and from the Electors and States of <HI>Germany,</HI> and in long debating of matters (to the which the Bishop of <HI>Leeg</HI> came, a great Segnior, and stoute Prelate) a peace was conclu|ded, and for the ioy thereof, I saw a generall Procession in <HI>Bruzels,</HI> where all the Embassadors and States were (sa|uing the Embassador of <HI>Englande,</HI> and all the Nobilitie of <HI>Flaunders</HI>) whiche made such a shewe, and reached suche a length in the str&eacute;etes, and tarried so long there, as was a wonder to beholde, and the strangest viewe that hadde bin s&eacute;ene in that place many yeares before, the number of Gentlemen was so great, and the commo~ people so many.</P>
<P>But all this reioycing turned to woe &amp; lamentatio~ with|in a short term after, for whe~ the <HI>Spaniards</HI> wer gone, there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ell out such matter betw&eacute;ene y^e States and <HI>Don Iohn,</HI> that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> came agayne, but not to <HI>Antwerp,</HI> for that the States had politikely possessed, &amp; many other Townes be|fore, of great importance &amp; strength: and <HI>Don Iohn</HI> and his people were assembled in <HI>Namure,</HI> &amp; much businesse was set abroche betw&eacute;ene these two sides (after <HI>Don Iohn</HI> had bin triu~pha~tly receiued into <HI>Bruzels</HI>) and either of these parties armed the~selues, &amp; wrought for their adua~tage what plea|sed best their fancies, some sending into <HI>Spaine,</HI> &amp; some sen|ding otherwhere, the necessitie of both their causes so re|quired, &amp; the troublous time they felt, enforced those causes.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="33">The estates nowe beganne to leane to the Prince of <HI>O|range,</HI> and deale throughly and playnely with him, whyche was a greate strength vnto them, and an occasion to re|forme the rest of the nobilitie to drawe one kinde of way, if they determined to withstande <HI>Don Iohn,</HI> as they made shew they would. But some that made promise there vnto, brake suddayncly, and turned to <HI>Don Iohn,</HI> who was lea|uying of a power to inuade <HI>Flaunders,</HI> and had togither both footemen and Horsemen, a very gallante company, and those were auntient and perfite Souldioures, that had serued many yeares in great aduentures and hazards. And to speake as the common fame wente (and right wise and noble men did report,) <HI>Don Iohn</HI> for his owne person was a wise and most famous noble man, that well was wor|thie (for many good partes in him) to haue had the leading of a Camp as great as King <HI>Alexanders</HI> army of <HI>Macedo|nie,</HI> whose men of warre were at the conquering of most parte of the worlde. Thus was <HI>Don Iohn</HI> and his power in a manner readie to marche, and lay aboute <HI>Namure,</HI> to tarrie the comming of some such bands of Horsemen as he looked for, and be fully furnished of such things as he wan|ted.</P>
<P>The States had in like sorte assembled a very great ar|mie, and were as readie to marche, as occasion fell out: and knowing that their enimies must haue much adoe, before they could winne any Towne of credite, the States deter|mined to w&eacute;erie <HI>Don Iohn,</HI> and so by policie and practise to striue with him, rather than with playne force and fight to encounter him: for their mightie walled Townes were a great blocke in <HI>Don Iohns</HI> way, whiche neyther coulde b&eacute;e wonne by their enimies, nor yet well could be bes&eacute;eged, but that the States hadde a meane to aide the Townes, and power ynough to rayse the seege, and could at any aduan|tage giue <HI>Don Iohn</HI> battell, without whiche aduantage it were no wisedome to deale with a strong and stout enimie.
<PB N="65" REF="33">
And on that resolution stande the noblest Souldioures now liuing. And woulde to God that towardly Prince and good Gentleman, the King of <HI>Portingall,</HI> had stoode on that poynte, whiche shall be spoken of in another matter, God sparing me life. But now to my purpose I proc&eacute;ede. But as the States looked to take <HI>Don Iohn</HI> at aduantage, or aw&eacute;erie him and his Souldioures with long warres and much labour, <HI>Don Iohn</HI> and his company were so well ex|perimented with paynes, and accustomed so often to suffer the miserie of warres, that they had such able mindes and bodies to endure and beare off the burthen of aduersitie, y^t the states should not easily that way haue had their willes, ouer them, although that the <HI>Spanyardes,</HI> by long rest and delicacie of <HI>Flaunders,</HI> were become some what slouthfull and effeminate: yet are they of such courage and complexi|on, when force doth compell them to trudge &amp; to toyle, that straightwayes, theyr nature is conuerted to their old ma|ner and custome, and they coulde for a n&eacute;ede frame them|selues to a new trade of trauell. Whiche shewes them as well armed within their mindes (where the man is beste knowen) as clad and defenced without, where nothing is good, if the minde set it not forwarde, and maintaine it to the vttermost. And the opinion of some souldiers is, both at home and abroade, that who so euer is daintie and vnseaso|ned, and can not martch in hardnesse, without a bagge and a bottle, were better be by a warme fire, tha~ in a cold field, &amp; will do more harme in a little p&eacute;ece of b&eacute;efe, than he ca~ to good in a great battaile, he is so loaded with his trinkets, &amp; mindes so much his meat. And although in a splene I haue spoken of the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> (yet no other than he deserues) so haue I s&eacute;ene both Frenchman and Borgonyon (and som&eacute; of our owne nation besydes,) that in the f&eacute;elde are more gr&eacute;edy of glorie, than hungry in the house, when a banquet is on the table. I must leaue off this sp&eacute;ech, and follow an|other humor. So <HI>Don Iohn</HI> &amp; the states, as you haue heard,
<PB N="66" REF="34">
deuised how the one might deceiue the other: and yet ney|ther of them both ventured further than good occasion com|manded them. And in this colde kind of seruice, the souldi|ours remayned, amyd the heate of Sommer a long sea|son, till <HI>Don Iohns</HI> power began to bidde the bace, and by a great mischaunce tooke the power of the states at aduan|tage, and slewe some of them, and hadde the reste in chace as farre as they durste followe, and so that byckering en|ded.</P>
<P>The states vpon this little ouerthrow (wherin the Scot|tish bands had the most hurt) attended both horsemen and footemen, out of <HI>Germanie,</HI> &amp; gaue <HI>Don Iohn</HI> leaue a while to march about a p&eacute;ece of the Countrey, minding as soone as the <HI>Cassemeer</HI> came down, to goe to the fielde agayne. And in the mean time, the states put their people in garri|sons.</P>
<P>Their enemies hauing a little leasure &amp; romth giuen the~ (more for some coulorable cause, than any constraint) bega~ to spurre about, and espy their commoditie: and by sleyght and force (as a camp can not want neither of the~ both) slip|ped into some simple seates and townes, &amp; carrying away credite with them, bycause they kept the fielde, were re|ceiued into many places, and chiefly into <HI>Louain.</HI> And some such as would vntwist the fast thr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">d of Faith &amp; Promise, became so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">pper of their wordes (when they minded to breake that the states coulde not holde them: and so after flickering fortune <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">hey fled, a matter worthy to be touched, but left off by me, to a riper iudgemente, that clearelye can construe the reason of these rotten causes.</P>
<P>A notable souldier called <HI>Monsieur de la Moet,</HI> gouer|nour of <HI>Gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">eling,</HI> went from the states at this time (as h&eacute;e sayd) to keepe the town, for the king. And diuerse others as the Count <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">nes, Monsieur Barlymont,</HI> and more than I can name, made their owne way to go whether they plea|sed: and for the time, the world in <HI>Flaunders</HI> was quicke, &amp;

dead: they were in dolor and heauinesse, that had not a light minde to comfort a sad hart: for the world was so sor|rowful, or so suttle, y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> a man might not scarcely at that sea|son laugh with his friend, nor trust his owne brother.

<P>When time came on to set abroch matters that mighte not runne cleare till the l&eacute;es were settled (and Wine wold be knowne fro~ vineger &amp; Ueriuice,) the euents of weigh|ty matter burste out, and made euery man of both the sids, <HI>Don Iohns,</HI> and the states, loke wel to their footing: for of necessitie, and countreys cause (besides the desire of fame &amp; honour) both these armies must march, to view the one the other, and in open field, do somewhat for reputations sake, and that they came for. And as farre as I can iudge, prince <HI>Cassemeer</HI> at this time was not come to the states. Well, the campes were in march, and both of them desirous to do what best became the time: and among the states, were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">repte (for seruice sake alone) some English Gentlemen, with such bandes as they coulde happen vpon, and furnishe at their own charges. And with these English Gentleme~, ioyned for good will in the fielde, the Scottish regiment (as I hearde.) And the English had an intente to march to the Camp, of the states. <HI>Don Iohns</HI> power hauing intellige~ce therof, made haste to preuente them, and so the skirmishe beganne, and lasted a long season, and for certainetie, had not the Englishe and Scottishe nations done theyr due|tie and verye well withal, they hadde bene repulsed, and peraduenture ouerthrowen. I woulde praise and com|mende anye manne that did well that daye, but for that

I am ignoraunt of that which was truely done, and would be loath to flatter one, and offend another, I omitte al their names, but master <HI>Iohn Norrises,</HI> for this presente, til my next booke of other warres be printed and published, at whiche time I shall know the truth of that I treate of.</P>
<P>The <HI>Casameer</HI> with a greate power of horsemen, and footemen, was come at this presente, or in a short while af|ter, and <HI>Don Iohn</HI> then was to consider and aide the daun|ger might haue followed, for his armye was a great deale lesse in number than the power of the states, and ofte~times the states were in minde to besiege <HI>Louaine,</HI> but neuer vn|readie to watch for the enemies, &amp; offer the battel, whyche was loked for daylye: the <HI>Burgonions</HI> side were also well disposed, &amp; it was certainly thought, that <HI>Don Iohns</HI> side was as gallaunt. Nowe were pollicies and strata|gemes to b&eacute;e s&eacute;ene. Nowe the shewe of warre, and clatte|ring of armes might be hard. Now the poulder and bullets were prepared, and stoute and manly skirmishes began a|freshe, and the souldiers bespredde the plaines, as thicke as the blacke crowes, that flyes swarming out of the wilde wooddes: and the whole people and commons of <HI>Flaunders</HI> thought they should be rid of their enimies, that so long had enpouershed their rich and plentifull countrey. For they smarted (poore soules) that often had bin spoyled, &amp; they felt al the wrong, that knewe not howe to righte themselues, but by Gods grace, and gaping after victorie.</P>
<P>At this present time, victualles began to be maruelous d&eacute;ere, and after the <HI>Rutters</HI> and <HI>Casemeeres</HI> company were payed, money among other bandes was harde to come by, and in that sort, a verie long time was spent and consumed, yet some were relieued with that treasure the States could spare: but in fine, suche scarcitie and miscrie came on and fel among thousa~ds, that both sicknesses and sodaine death ensued. And at length, the plague, (of whiche manye made an ende of their liues) was sparkled both in Campe and in
<PB N="69" REF="35">
Country, &amp; no one place was fr&eacute;e from one disease or other, that either stoode neare the Campe, or where the sicke soul|diers repaired. And some of our English Ge~tleme~ dropped downe in that visitation, as Mayster <HI>Thomas Cobham,</HI> and others, no greate number. This sorrowfull and feare|full sicknesse as much vexed &amp; troubled the poore people, as any miserie they felt, &amp; made the troubled conscience more afraid, than the view of all <HI>Don Iohns</HI> power.</P>
<P>Much practising and working there was for a peace by oure Princes Ambassadors, that were sorie to s&eacute;e so much bloudshed and mischiefe as might fall oute vppon a battell. And manye times peace was expected, and likely to haue happened, if <HI>Don Iohn</HI> woulde haue agr&eacute;ed to any reasona|ble conditions. But in conclusion, <HI>Don Iohn,</HI> by a hope h&eacute;e had in some faction or practise (either among <HI>Pater Noster</HI> men, a company so called, or others fauorers to <HI>Don Iohns</HI> doing) woulde not agr&eacute;e to the peace, nor do any thing that stoode againste his determination. So, continuing in a re|solute minde, he thruste diuers bands of <HI>Spaniardes,</HI> and o|ther souldiours, into such Townes and Fortresses as h&eacute;e hadde possessed, and with suche power as he had lefte, mar|ched towardes <HI>Namure</HI> or those parties, meaning not, as he made shew therof, to trouble the States any further for a seaso~. There were some that threw down churches and ve|xed and troubled religious persons, againste whome rose a company of <HI>Wallons,</HI> naming the~selues <HI>Pater Noster</HI> men, &amp; sometimes encountred those that destroyed religious hou|ses, &amp; made slaughter on the~, as they might make their par|tie good: &amp; that matter is not yet pacifyed, for about <HI>Gaunt</HI> &amp; other townes are many that s&eacute;eke to doe mischiefe, &amp; name|ly to their owne nation and countreymen. Which is a be|ginning of sorrow, &amp; a sore dangerous thing to continue.</P>
<P>The power of <HI>Don Iohn</HI> in manye sortes of seruices hath done what they coulde, to vistresse the bandes that the states giue entertainement too, but the states and their
<PB N="70" REF="36">
people are, and haue bin too strong for <HI>Don Iohns</HI> power. Sundrie skirmishes, &amp; oneof the~ before <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ine,</HI> I could a lit|tle write of: but, for that no great thing was atchieued by the~, I lap the~ vp among other matters, that I neither haue occasion much to dilate off, nor you are desirous to heare. For, he that shall write of euerye thing was done, hadde n&eacute;ede to haue manye bodies, to be in euerye place at once, and twice so many eies, to note in what order the thinges fell out, or otherwise he maye misse of the troth, as some haue, that were in the fielde when seruice was to be s&eacute;ene, whose intelligence I hadde, and yet an other in the same company doth tell me a contrary tale: For whiles one is in the skirmishe, and another is a forraging, they are seue|callye occupyed, and will make sundry discourses: and for my owne parte, I proteste before God, I hadde rather followe the truth of the matter, than the flatterie of the time: so that if anye error haue passed my pen, it oughte to be pardonable, for that I hate to publishe &amp; set out a fable, and loue to preferre the knowledge and vnderstanding of a troth: and speaking of any man or matter, enimy or friend, I woulde y&eacute;elde them due praise and commendation, not onely for to winne my workes the more credite, but lyke|wise to vse a kinde of duetifull courteste, and so to pay in reporte euery person lyuing, the debt that I do owe him.</P>
<P>Nowe it is to be vnderstoode, that whiles <HI>Don Iohn</HI> was busie aboute his warres, the Qu&eacute;enes Maiestie sente Embassadours to treate of amitie and peace, (as you haue hearde before) and the laste that went ouer aboute these chargeable affairs, were two most honorable personages, the Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> &amp; sir <HI>Francis Walsingham,</HI> on whom at|tended as gallant a traine of Gentlemen, as wente from hence to <HI>Flaunders</HI> these twenty yeares. And as the true re|porte goeth, these noble Embassadoures helde and kepte suche ch&eacute;ere (in a d&eacute;ere and scarce season for victualles) that the like hathe not b&eacute;ene s&eacute;ene, neyther of late, nor manye
<PB N="71" REF="36">
yeres agoe. And the bountie that one of the Embassadours vsed (whose d&eacute;edes shall shewe his name) out of hys owne purse and francke liberalitie, exc&eacute;eded, and is to be honou|red for euer. And when these Embassadors had laine there a greate while, (and finished that was thought necessarie &amp; m&eacute;ete) they returned to the Courte. Since whiche time (as God ordaines all thinges) <HI>Don Iohn</HI> is dead, and many o|ther noble men more. And the plague is so hote among the <HI>Spaniardes,</HI> and the rest that lies in camps (as is to b&eacute;e pro|ued) that euen as a shephearde doth point oute his sh&eacute;ep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ulles out those lambe~s that he sendes to the slaughter house: so God (as it s&eacute;emeth) with his stretched out arme, toucheth whome h&eacute;e pleaseth, &amp; by the finger of hys wrath and scourge of plague, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ings thousandes vnderfoote, and tu~bles the~ in their graue. And this is a thing maruelously to be noted (not specially abroade, but wisely here at home) that some haue no power to goe from the plague, and some, goe where they will, the plague doeth followe them. For it skippeth ouer houses and housholdes, and enters in their doores, that maketh sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e bothe doores and windowes, not brought altogither by infection of clothes and garmentes, but sent for foule offences, by a power past our iudgeme~ts, and is to be presupposed a messenger of Gods anger, &amp; an Angell of yre, that waytes as well on the good, to take the~ from the badde &amp; wicked of this worlde, as followes the wicked, to make Gods power knowne, and man confesse his own faults &amp; follie. Now, if men would looke narrow|ly into the sore affliction of <HI>Flaunders,</HI> for the space of thirty yeares, they would thinke they haue had plagues ynowe (if God so were pleased) besides the fearefull pestilence it selfe, which of all things is most terrible, and yet the more is the pitie, there cannot be a worse plague among Christi|ans, than disagr&eacute;ement, and publique dissention, whiche is to b&eacute;e feared hathe taken suche d&eacute;epe roote in <HI>Flaun|ders,</HI> that it wil not, nor can not be holpen, but by the
<PB N="72" REF="37">
pollicie of puissaunt Princes, and prayers of good people.</P>
<P>Thus farre haue I gone (Gentle Reader) to make th&eacute;e conceiue howe mercifully God hathe dealte with oure Countrey, and howe sharply our neighbors hau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> affli|cted, in a manner rounde aboute vs, whiche I wil (God willing) speake of in an other volume, if fououralby you can afoorde to giue this my bare and barraine Discourse youre good reporte, and at the least (for my study and labor (althoughe you mislike it) recompence me with silence, or else, as this was done in little time, so take what leysure you list, and write another worke of more value &amp; weight, whiche I shall be as gladde to giue commendation vnto, as I shall be sorie, when I knowe these paines haue not contented you: as witnesseth our liuing Lorde, who multiply his graces among vs, and sende concorde and quiet|nesse to the iarring and troubled state of <HI>Flaunders.</HI></P>

<LG>
<L>GO sillie Booke to suttle Worlde, and shevv thy simple face,</L>
<L>And forvvard passe, and do not turne agayne to my disgrace.</L>
<L>For thou shalt bring to peoples eares but troth that needes not blush,</L>
<L>And though Maell Bouch giue thee rebuke, care not for that a rush,</L>
<L>For euill tongs do ytch so sore, they must be rubbing still</L>
<L>Against the teeth, that should hold fast the clapper of the Mill.</L>
<L>Desire those men that likes thee not, to lay thee dovvne againe,</L>
<L>Till some svveete nappe, and harmelesse sleepe hath settled troubled brayne.</L>
<L>And vvhen one house doth shutte thee out, creepe to another streight,</L>
<L>And though thy mayster be but playne, yet looke thou vse some sleight</L>
<L>To purchace loue, and credite both, for that shall breede good bloud,</L>
<L>And thou vvith prayse, and honest brute, mayst do thy Maister good.</L>
<L><PB REF="38" MS="y">But if they reade thee in disdeyne, slippe from them if thou may,</L>
<L>Let enuye svvell, and malice poult, I heare not vvhat they say.</L>
<L>I made thee for to please the best, the vvorst may mend the vvhile,</L>
<L>So vvisedome bids thee vvelcome Booke, thou mayst at folly smile.</L>
<L>An ounce of prayse from vvise mens mouth, vvayes dovvne a pound of fame,</L>
<L>That fooles do giue, vvhose slender skill, scarce scannes mens honest name.</L>
<L>If Court embrace thee for my sake, to Countrey then in post,</L>
<L>Be sure then neyther thy bare vvords, nor my poore vvorke is lost.</L>
<L>Where Souldioures are, aduance thy selfe, for though some faults they spye,</L>
<L>Their martiall minds vvill make them cast on thee a friendly eye.</L>
<L>Among Diuines and Scholemen oft, come not, but for a change,</L>
<L>For at thy levvde and rubbish phrase, the learned vvill looke strange.</L>
<L>To men of Lavv do freelie goe, for they good fellovves are,</L>
<L><PB REF="38">And can vvith toyes sometimes vvell ease, the vveight of Countreys care.</L>
<L>With Merchant men make thine aboade, vvho loues to heare of Peace:</L>
<L>So shall it be, vvhen bloudie broyles in Flaunders ginnes to ceasse.</L>
<L>Thus haue I taught thee vvhat good course thou oughtst of right to hold,</L>
<L>Thou art a Booke, goe vvhere thou vvilte, like Bayard blind be bold.</L>
<L>Thou shalt haue mates to follovv thee, and help thee if thou fall.</L>
<L>I haue vvide scope at vvill to vvalke, yea Penne and Muse at call,</L>
<L>And other Bookes that I must needes committe to Worldes report.</L>
