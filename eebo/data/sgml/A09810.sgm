<P>_GOod Friend: As wee cannot but account it an extraordina|ry blessing of God in direct|ing our course for these parts, after we came out of our natiue countrey, for that we had the happinesse to be posses|sed of the comforts we receiue by the bene|fit of one of the most pleasant, most health|full, and most fruitfull parts of the world: So must wee acknowledge the same blessing to bee multiplied vpon our whole company, for that we obtained the honour to receiue allowance and approbation of our free possession, and enioying thereof vnder the authority of those thrice honou|red Persons, the <HI>President</HI> and <HI>Counsell</HI> for the affaires of <HI>New-England,</HI> by whose boun|ty and grace, in that behalfe, all of vs are ti|ed to dedicate our best seruice vnto them, as those vnder his Majestie, that wee owe it vnto: whose noble endeuours in these their

<P>As for this poore Relation, I pray you to accept it, as being writ by the seuerall Actors themselues, after their plaine and rude manner; therefore doubt nothing of the truth thereof: if it be defectiue in any thing, it is their ignorance, that are better acquainted with planting then writing. If it satisfie those that are well affected to the businesse, it is all I care for. Sure I am the place we are in, and the hopes that are apparent, cannot but suffice any that will not desire more then enough, neither is there want of ought among vs but compa|ny to enioy the blessings so plentifully be|stowed vpon the inhabitants that are here. While I was a writing this, I had almost forgot, that I had but the recommendation of the relation it selfe, to your further consi|deration, and therefore I will end without saying more, saue that I shall alwaies rest</P>

<P>_COurteous Reader, be intreated to make a fauorable construction of my forwardnes, in publishing these inseuing discourses, the desire of carrying the Gospell of Christ, into those forraigne parts, amongst those people that as yet haue had no knowledge, nor tast of God, as also to procure vnto themselues and others a quiet and comfortable habytation: weare amongst other things the inducements (vnto these vndertakers of the then hopefull, and now experimentally knowne good enterprice for plantation, in <HI>New England,</HI> to set afoote and prosecute the same &amp; though it fared with them, as it is common to the most actions of this nature, that the first at|temps proue diffecult, as the sequell more at large expresseth, yet it hath pleased God, eue~ beyond our expectation in so short a time, to giue hope of let|ting some of them see (though some he hath taken out of this vale of teares) some grounds of hope, of the accomplishment of both those endes by them, at first propounded.</P>

<HEAD>CERTAINE VSEFVL ADVERTISEMENTS SENT in a Letter written by a discreete friend vn|to the Planters in <HI>New England,</HI> at their first setting saile from Southhampton, who earnestly desireth the prosperitie of that their new Plantation.</HEAD>
<P>_LOuing and Christian friends, I doe heartily and in the Lord salute you all, as being they with whom I am present in my best affection, and most earnest longings after you, though I be constrained for a while to be bodily absent from you, I say constrained, God knowing how willing|ly and much rather then otherwise I would haue haue borne my part with you in this first brunt, were I not by strong necessitie held backe for the present. Make account of me in the meane while, as of a man deuided in my selfe with great paine, and as (naturall bonds set aside) hauing my better part with you. And though I doubt not but in your godly wisedomes you both foresee and re|solue vpon that which concerneth your present
<PB REF="5">
state and condition both seuerally and ioyntly, yet ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e I thought but my dutie to adde some further spurre of prouocation vnto them who run already, if not because you need it, yet because I owe it in loue and dutie.</P>
<P>And first, as we are daily to renew our repentance with our God, speciall for our sinnes knowne, and generall for our vnknowne trespasses; so doth the Lord call vs in a singular maner vpon occasions of such difficultie and danger as lieth vpon you, to a both more narrow search and carefull reformation of our wayes in his sight, lest he calling to remem|brance our sinnes forgotten by vs or vnrepented of, take aduantage against vs, and in iudgement leaue vs for the same to be swallowed vp in one danger or other; whereas on the contrary, sin being taken away by earnest repentance and the pardon thereof from the Lord, sealed vp vnto a mans conscience by his Spirit, great shall be his securitie and peace in all dangers, sweete his comforts in all distresses, with happie deliuerance from all euill, whether in life or in death.</P>
<P>Now next after this heauenly peace with God and our owne consciences, we are carefully to pro|uide for peace with all men what in vs lieth, especi|ally with our associates, and for that end watchful|nes must be had, that we neither at all in our selues do giue, no nor easily take offence being giuen by others. Woe be vnto the world for offences, for though it be necessary (considering the malice of Satan and mans corruption) that offences come, yet woe vnto the man or woman either by whom
<PB REF="5">
the offence cometh, saith Christ, Math. 18.7. And if offences in the vnseasonable vse of things in them selues indifferent, be more to be feared then death it selfe, as the Apostle teacheth, 1. Cor. 9.15. how much more in things simply euill, in which neither honour of God nor loue of man is thought worthy to be regarded.</P>
<P>Neither yet is it sufficient that we keep our selues by the grace of God from giuing offence, except withall we be armed against the taking of them when they are giuen by others. For how vnperfect and lame is the worke of grace in that person, who wants charitie to couer a multitude of offences, as the Scriptures speake. Neither are you to be exhor|ted to this grace onely vpon the common grounds of Christianitie, which are, that persons ready to take offence, either want charitie to couer offences, or wisedome duly to weigh humane frailtie; or lastly are grosse, though close hypocrites, as Christ our Lord teacheth, Math. 7.1, 2, 3. as indeed in mine owne experience, few or none haue beene found which sooner giue offence, then such as easily take it; neither haue they euer proued sound and profi|table members in societies, which haue nourished in themselues that touchey humour. But besides these, there are diuers spe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iall motiues prouoking you aboue others to great care and conscience this way: As first, you are many of you strangers, as to the persons, so to the infirmities one of another, and so stand in neede of more watchfulnesse this way, lest when such things fall out in men and wo|men as you suspected not, you be inordinately af|fected
<PB REF="6">
with them; which doth require at your hands much wisedome and charitie for the co|uering and preuenting of incident offences that way. And last<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y your intended course of ciuill com|munitie wil minister continuall occasion of offence, and will be as fuell for that fire, except you dili|gently quench it with brotherly forbearance. And if taking of offence causlesly or easily at mens do|ings be so carefully to be auoided, how much more heed is to be taken that we take not offence at God himselfe, which yet we certainly do so oft as we do murmure at his prouidence in our crosses, or beare impatiently such afflictions as wherewith he pleaseth to visit vs. Store we vp therefore pa|tience against the euill day, without which we take offence at the Lord himselfe in his holy and iust works.</P>
<P>A fourth thing there is carefully to be prouided for, to wit, that with your common emploiments you ioyne common affections truly bent vpon the generall good, auoiding as a deadly plague of your both common and speciall comfort all retirednesse of minde for proper aduantage, and all singularly affected any maner of way; let euery man represse in himselfe and the whole bodie in each person, as so many rebels against the common good, all pri|uate respects of mens selues, not sorting with the generall conueniencie. And as men are carefull not to haue a new house shaken with any violence before it be well settled and the parts firmly knit: so be you, I beseech you brethren, much more care|full, that the house of God which you are and are
<PB REF="6">
to be, be not shaken with vnnecessary nouelties or other oppositions at the first settling thereof.</P>
<P>Lastly, whereas you are to become a body politik, vsing amongst your selues ciuill gouernment, and are not furnished with any persons of speciall emi|nencie aboue the rest, to be chosen by you into of|fice of gouernment: Let your wisedome and godli|nesse appeare, not onely in chusing such persons as do entirely loue, and will diligently promote the common good, but also in yeelding vnto them all due honour and obedience in their lawfull admi|nistrations; not beholding in them the ordinarinesse of their persons, but Gods ordinance for your good; nor being like vnto the foolish multitude, who more honour the gay coate, then either the vertu|ous mind of the man, or glorious ordinance of the Lord. But you know better things, and that the i|mage of the Lords power and authoritie which the Magistrate beareth, is honorable, in how meane per|sons soeuer. And this dutie you both may the more willingly, and ought the more conscionably to per|forme, because you are at least for the present to haue onely them for your ordinary gouernours, which your selues shall make choise of for that worke.</P>
<P>Sundrie other things of importance I could put you in mind of, and of those before mentioned in more words, but I will not so far wrong your godly minds, as to thinke you heedlesse of these things, there being also diuers among you so well able to admonish both themselues and others of what con|cerneth them. These few things therefore, and
<PB REF="7">
the same in few words I do earnestly commend vn|to your care and conscience, ioyning therewith my daily incessant prayers vnto the Lord, that he who hath made the heauens and the earth, the sea and all riuers of waters, and whose prouidence is ouer all his workes, especially ouer all his deare childre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for good, would so guide and guard you in your wayes, as inwardly by his Spirit, so outwardly by the hand of his power, as that both you and we al|so, for and with you, may haue after matter of prai|sing his Name all the days of your and our liues. Fare you well in him in whom you trust, and in whom I rest</P>

<HEAD>A RELATION OR IOVRNALL OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE Plantation setled at <HI>Plimoth</HI> in New ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<P>_WEdnesday the sixt of <HI>Septem|ber,</HI> the Wind comming East North East, a sine small gale, we loosed from <HI>Plimoth,</HI> ha|uing beene kindly intertained and curteously vsed by diuer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> friends there dwelling, and af|ter many difficulties in boy|sterous stormes, at length by Gods prouidence vpon the ninth of <HI>Nouember</HI> following, by breake of the day we espied land which we deemed to be <HI>Cape Cod,</HI> and so afterward it proued. And the appea|rance of it much comforted vs, especially, seeing so good|ly a Land, and woodded to the brinke of the sea, it caused vs to reioyce together, and praise God that had giuen vs once againe to see land. And thus wee made our course South South West, purposing to goe to a Riuer ten leagues
<PB REF="8">
to the South of the Cape, but at night the winde being con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rary, we put round againe for the Bay of <HI>Cape Cod:</HI> and vpon the 11. of <HI>Nouember,</HI> we came to an anchor in the Bay, which is a good harbour and pleasant Bay, circled round, except in the entrance, which is about foure miles ouer from land to land, compassed about to the very Sea with Okes, Pines, Iuniper, Sassafras, and other sweet wood; it is a harbour wherein 1000. saile of Ships may safely ride, there we relieued our selues with wood and water, and re|freshed our people, while our shallop was fitted to coast the Bay, to search for an habitation: there was the greatest store of fowle that euer we saw.</P>
<P>An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uery day we saw Whales playing hard by vs, of which in that place, if we had instruments &amp; meanes to take them, we might haue made a very rich returne, which to our great griefe we wanted. Our master and his mate, and other<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> experienced in fishing, professed, we might haue made three or foure thousand pounds worth of Oyle; they preferred it before Greenland Whale-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ishing, &amp; purpose the next winter to fish for Whale here; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">od we a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ayed, but found none, there is good store no doubt in their season. Neither got we any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h all the time we lay there, but some few little ones on the shore. We found great Mussles, and very fat and full of Sea pearle, but we could not eat them, for they made vs all sicke that did eat, as well saylers as pas|sengers; they caused to cast and se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ure, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t they were soone well againe. The bay is so round &amp; circling, that before we could come to anchor, we went round all the points of the Compasse. We could not come neere the shore by three quarters of an English mile, because of shallow water, which was a great preiudice to vs, for our people going on shore were forced to wade a bow shoot or two in going a|land, which caused many to get colds and coughs, for it was many times freezing cold weather.</P>
<P>This day before we came to harbour, obseruing some not well affected to vnitie and concord, but gaue some appea|rance of faction, it was thought good there should be an as|sociation and agreement, that we should combine together
<PB N="3" REF="8">
in one body, and to submit to such government and gover|nours, as we should by common consent agree to make and chose, and set our hands to this that followes word fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> word.</P>

<P>Having vnder-taken for the glory of God, and advance|ment of the Christian Faith, and honour of our King and Countrey, a Voyage to plant the first Colony in the Nor|therne parts of <HI>VIRGINIA,</HI> doe by these presents solemnly &amp; mutually in the presence of <HI>God</HI> and one of another, cove|nant, and combine our selues together into a civill body po|litike, for our better ordering and preservation, and furthe|rance of the ends aforesaid; and by vertue hereof to en|act, constitute, and frame such iust and equall Lawes, Ordi|nances, acts, constitutions, offices from time to time, as shall be thought most meet and convenient for the generall good of the Colony: vnto which we promise all due submission and obedience. In witnesse whereof we haue here vnder subscribed our names. <HI>Cape Cod</HI> 11. of <HI>November,</HI> in the yeare of the raigne of our soveraigne Lord King IAMES, of <HI>Eng|land, France,</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> 18. and of <HI>Scotland</HI> 54. <HI>Anno Do|mino</HI> 1620.</P>
<P>The same day so soone as we could we set a-shore 15. or 16. men, well armed, with some to fetch wood, for we had none left; as also to see what the Land was, and what Inha|bitants they could meet with, they found it to be a small neck of Land; on this side where we lay is the <HI>Bay</HI> and the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rther side the Sea; the ground or earth, sand hils, much like the Downes in <HI>Holland,</HI> but much better; the crust of the earth a Spits depth, excellent blacke earth; all wooded with Okes, Pines, Sassafras, Iuniper, Birch, Holly, Vines, some Ash, Wal|nut; the wood for the most part open and without vnder|wood, sit either to goe or ride in: at night our people retur|ned,
<PB N="4" REF="9">
but found not any person, nor habitation, and laded their Boat with Iuniper, which smelled very sweet &amp; strong, and of which we burnt the most part of the time we lay there.</P>
<P>Munday the 13. of <HI>November,</HI> we vnshipped our Shallop and drew her on land, to mend and repaire her, having bin forced to cut her downe in bestowing her betwixt the decks, and she was much opened with the peoples lying in her, which kept vs long there, for it was 16. or 17. dayes be|fore the Carpenter had finished her; our people went on shore to refresh themselues, and our women to wash&punc; as they had great need; but whilest we lay thus still, hoping our Shallop would be ready in fiue or sixe dayes at the furthest, but our Carpenter made slow worke of it, so that some of our people impatient of delay, desired for our better furthe|rance to travaile by Land into the Countrey, which was not without appearance of danger, not having the Shallop with them nor meanes to carry provision, but on their backes, to see whether it might be fit for vs to seate in or no, and the ra|ther because as we sayled into the Harbour, there seemed to be a river opening it selfe into the maine land; the willingnes of the persons was liked, but the thing it selfe, in regard of the danger was rather permitted then approved, and so with cautions, directions, and instructions, sixteene men were set out with every man his Musket, Sword, and Corslet, vn|der the conduct of Captaine <HI>Miles Standish,</HI> vnto whom was adioyned for counsell and advise, <HI>William Bradford, Stephen Hopkins,</HI> and <HI>Edward Tilley.</HI></P>
<P>Wednesday the 15. of <HI>November,</HI> they were set a shore, and when they had ordered themselues in the order of a sin|gle File, and marched about the space of a myle, by the Sea they espyed fiue or sixe people, with a Dogge comming to|wards them, who were Savages, who when they saw them ran into the Wood and whilled the Dogge after them, &amp;c. First, they supposed them to be master <HI>Iones,</HI> the Master and some of his men, for they were a shore, and knew of their comming, but after they knew them to be <HI>Indians</HI> they mar|ched
<PB N="5" REF="9">
after them into the Woods, least other of the <HI>Indians</HI> should lie in Ambush; but when the <HI>Indians</HI> saw our men fol|lowing them, they ran away with might and may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e and our men turned out of the Wood after them, for it was the way they intended to goe, but they could not come neare them. They followed them that night about ten miles by the trace of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ootings, and saw how they had come the same way they went, and at a turning perceived how they r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n vp an hill, to see whether they followed them. At length night came vpon them, and they were constrained to take vp their lodging, so they set forth three Sentinells, and the rest, some kindled a fire, and others fetched wood, and there held our Randevous that night. In the morning so soone as we could see the trace, we proceeded on our iourney, &amp; had the tracke vntill we had compassed the head of a long creake, and there they tooke into another wood, and we after them, supposing to finde some of their dwellings, but we marched thorow boughes and bushes, and vnder hills and vallies, which tore our very Armour in peeces, and yet could meete with none of them, nor their houses, nor finde any fresh water, which we greatly desired, and stood in need off, for we brought neither Beere nor Water with vs, and our victuals was one|ly Bisket and Holland cheese, and a little Bottle of <HI>aquavite,</HI> so as we were sore a thirst. About ten a clocke we came into a deepe Valley, full of brush, wood-gaile, and long grasse, through which we found little paths or tracts, and there we saw a Deere, and found springs of fresh water, of which we were heartily glad, and sat vs downe and drunke our first <HI>New-England</HI> water with as much delight as euer we drunke drinke in all our liues. When we had refreshed our selues, we directed our course full South, that we might come to the shore, which within a short while after we did, and there made a fire, that they in the ship might see where wee were (as we had direction) and so marched on towards this sup|posed River; and as we went in another valley we found a fine cleere Pond of fresh water, being about a Musket sho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> broad, and twise as long; there grew also many small vines,
<PB N="6" REF="10">
and Foule and Deere haunted there; there grew much Sasa|fras: from thence we went on &amp; found much plaine ground, about fiftie Acres, fit for the Plow, and some signes where the <HI>Indians</HI> had formerly planted their corne; after this, some thought it best for nearenesse of the river to goe downe and travaile on the Sea sands, by which meanes some of our men were tyred, and lagged behind, so we stayed and gathered them vp, and struck into the Land againe; where we found a little path to certaine heapes of sand, one whereof was cove|red with old Matts, and had a woodden thing like a morter whelmed on the top of it, and an earthen pot layd in a little hole at the end thereof; we musing what it might be, digged &amp; found a Bow, and, as we thought, Arrowes, but they were rotten; We supposed, there were many other things, but because we deemed them graues, we put in the Bow againe and made it vp as it was, and left the rest vntouched, because we thought it would be odious vnto them to ransacke their Sepulchers. We went on further and found new stubble, of which they had gotten Corne this yeare, and many Wallnut trees full of Nuts, and great store of Strawberries, and some Vines; passing thus a field or two, which were not great, we came to another, which had also bin new gotten, and there we found where an house had beene, and foure or fiue old Plankes layed together; also we found a great Ketle, which had beene some Ships ketle and brought out of <HI>Europe</HI>; there was also an heape of sand, made like the former, but it was newly done, we might see how they had padled it with their hands which we digged vp, and in it we found a little old Basket full of faire <HI>Indian</HI> Corne, and digged further &amp; found a fine great new Basket full of very faire corne of this yeare, with some 36. goodly eares of corne, some yellow, and some red, and others mixt with blew, which was a very goodly sight: the Basket was round, and narrow at the top, it held about three or foure Bushels, which was as much as two of vs could lift vp from the ground, and was very handsomely and cunningly made; But whilst wee were busie about these things, we set our men Sentinell in a round ring, all but two
<PB N="7" REF="10">

We were in suspence, what to doe with it, and the Ketle, and at length after much consultation, we concluded to take the Ketle, and as much of the Corne as we could carry away with vs; and when our Shallop came, if we could find any of the people, and come to parley with them, we would giue them the Ketle againe, and satisfie them for their Corne, so wee tooke all the eares and put a good deale of the loose Corne in the Ketle for two men to bring away on a staffe; besides, they that could put any into their Pockets filled the same; the rest wee buried a|gaine, for we were so laden with Armour that we could car|ry no more. Not farre from this place we found the remain|der of an old Fort, or Palizado, which as we conceiued had beene made by some Christians, this was also hard by that place which we thought had beene <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> river, vnto which wee went and found it so to be, deviding it selfe into two armes by an high banke, standing right by the cut or mouth which came from the Sea, that which was next vnto vs was the lesse, the other arme was more then twise as big, and not vnlike to be an harbour for ships; but whether it be a fresh river, or onely an indraught of the Sea, we had no time to discover; for wee had Commandement to be out but two dayes. Here also we saw two Canoas, the one on the one side, the other on the other side, wee could not beleeue it was a Canoa, till we came neare it, so we returned leauing the further disco|very hereof to our Shallop, and came that night backe againe to the fresh water pond, and there we made our Rande<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ous that night, making a great fire, and a Baricado to windward of vs, and kept good watch with three Sentinells all night, euery one standing when his turne came, while fiue or sixe inches of Match was burning. It proved a very rainie night. In the morning we tooke our Ketle and sunke it in the pond, and trimmed our Muskets, for few of them would goe off because of the wett, and so coasted the wood againe to come home, in which we were shrewdly pus-led, and lost our way, as we wandred we came to a tree, where a yong Spritt was bowed downe over a bow, and some Acornes strewed vn|der

Wee also did spring three couple of Partridges; and as we came along by the creake, wee saw great flockes of wild Geese and D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ckes, but they were very fearefull of vs. So we marched some while in the Woods, some while on the sands, and other while in the water vp to the knees, till at length we came neare the Ship, and then we shot off our Peeces, and the long Boat came to fetch vs; ma|ster <HI>Iones,</HI> and master <HI>Caruer</HI> being on the shore, with many of our people, came to meete vs. And thus wee came both weary and well-come home, and deliuered in our Corne in|to the store, to be kept for seed, for wee knew not how to come by any, and therefore were very glad, purposing so soone as we could meete with any of the Inhabitants of that place, to make them large satisfaction. This was our first Discovery, whilst our Shallop was in repairing; our people did make things as fitting as they could, and time would, in seeking out wood, and heluing of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ooles, and sawing of Tymber to build a new Shallop, but the discommodiousnes of the harbour did much hinder vs for we could neither goe to, nor come from the shore, but at high water, which was much to our hinderance and hurt, for oftentimes they waded to the midle of the thigh, and oft to the knees, to goe and come from land; some did it necessarily, and some for their owne pleasure, but it brought to the most, if not to all, coughes and colds, the weather prouing sodainly cold and stormie which afterward turned to the scurvey, whereof ma|ny dyed.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="11">When our Shallop was fit indeed, before she was fully fit|ted, for there was two dayes worke after bestowed on her, there was appointed some 24 men of our owne, and armed, then to goe and make a more full discovery of the rivers be|fore mentioned. Master <HI>Iones</HI> was desirous to goe with vs, and tooke such of his saylers as he thought vsefull for vs, so as we were in all about 34. men; wee made master <HI>Iones</HI> our Leader, for we thought it best herein to gratifie his kindnes and forwardnes. When we were set forth, it proued rough weather and crosse windes, so as we were constrained, some in the Shallop, and others in the long Boate, to row to the neerest shore the wind would suffer them to goe vnto, and then to wade out aboue the knees; the wind was so strong as the Shallop could not keepe the water, but was forced to harbour there that night, but we marched sixe or seaven miles further, and appointed the Shallop to come to vs as soone as they could. It blowed and did snow all that day &amp; night, and frose withall; some of our people that are dead tooke the originall of their death here. The next day about 11. a clocke our Shallop came to vs, and wee shipped our selues, and the wind being good, we sayled to the river we formerly disco|vered, which we named, <HI>Cold Harbour,</HI> to which when wee came we found it not Navigable for Ships, yet we thought it might be a good harbour for Boats, for it flowes there 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. foote at high water. We landed our men betweene the two creekes, and marched some foure or fiue myles by the greater of them, and the Shallop followed vs; at length night grew on, and our men were tired with marching vp and downe the steepe hills, and deepe vallies, which lay halfe a foot thicke with snow: Master <HI>Iones</HI> vvearied with marching, was desi|rous we should take vp our lodging, though some of vs would haue marched further, so we made there our Randevous for that night, vnder a few Pine trees, and as it fell out, wee got three fat Geese, and six Ducks to our Supper, which we eate with Souldiers stomacks, for we had eaten little all that day; our resolution was next morning to goe vp to the head of this river, for we supposed it would proue fresh water, but in

the morning our resolution held not, because many liked not the hillinesse of the soyle, and badnesse of the harbour, so we turned towards the other creeke, that wee might goe over and looke for the rest of the Corne that we left behind when we were here before; when we came to the creeke, we saw the Canow lie on the dry ground, and a flocke of Geese in the river, at which one made a shot, and killed a couple of them, and we lanched the Canow &amp; fetcht them and when we had done, she carryed vs over by seaven or eight at once. This done, we marched to the place where we had the corne formerly, which place we called <HI>Corne-hill</HI>; and digged and found the rest, of which we were very glad: we also digged in a place little further off, and found a Botle of oyle; wee went to another place, which we had seene before, and dig|ged, and found more corne, <HI>viz.</HI> two or three Baskets full of <HI>Indian</HI> Wheat, and a bag of Beanes, with a good man, of faire Wheat-eares; whilst some of vs were digging vp this, some others found another heape of Corne, which they dig|ged vp also, so as we had in all about ten Bushels, which will serve vs sufficiently for seed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> And sure it was Gods good providence that we found this Corne, for els wee know not how we should haue done, for we knew not how we should find, or meete with any of the <HI>Indians,</HI> except it be to doe vs a mischiefe. Also we had neuer in all likelihood seene a graine of it, if we had not made our first Iourney; for the ground was now covered with snow, and so hard frosen, that we were faine with our Curtlaxes and short Swords, to hew and carue the ground a foot deepe, and then wrest it vp with leavers, for we had forgot to bring other Tooles; whilst we were in this imployment, foule weather being towards, Ma|ster <HI>Iones</HI> was earnest to goe abourd, but sundry of vs desired to make further discovery, and to find out the <HI>Indians</HI> habi|tations, so we sent home with him our weakest people, and some that were sicke, and all the Corne, and 18. of vs stayed still, and lodged there that night, and desired that the Shal|lop might returne to vs next day, and bring vs some Mat|tocks and Spades with them.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12">The next morning we followed certaine beaten pathes and tracts of the <HI>Indians</HI> into the Woods, supposing they would haue led vs into some Towne, or houses; after wee had gone a while, we light vpon a very broad beaten path, well nigh two foote broad then we lighted all our Matches, and prepared our selues, concluding wee were neare their dwellings, but in the end we found it to be onely a path made to driue Deere in, when the <HI>Indians</HI> hunt, as wee supposed; when we had ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ched fiue or six myles into the Woods, and could find no signes of any people, we returned againe ano|ther way, and as we came into the plaine ground, wee found a place like a graue, but it was much bigger and longer then any we had yet seene. It was also covered with boords, so as we mused what it should be, and resolved to digge it vp, where we found, first a Matt, and vnder that a fayre Bow, and there another Matt, and vnder that a boord about three quarters long, finely carued and paynted, with three tynes, or broches on the top, like a Crowne; also betweene the Matts we found Boules, Trayes, Dishes, and such like Trin|kets; at length we came to a faire new Matt, and vnder that two Bundles, the one bigger, the other lesse, we opened the greater and found in it a great quantitie of fine and perfect red Powder, and in it the bones and skull of a man. The skull had fine yellow haire still on it, and some of the flesh vnconsumed; there was bound vp with it a knife, a pack-needle, and two or three old iron things. It was bound vp in a Saylers canvas Casacke, and a payre of cloth breeches; the red Powder was a kind of Embaulment, and yeelded a strong, but no offensiue smell; It was as fine as any flower. We opened the lesse bundle likewise, and found of the same Powder in it, and the bones and head of a little childe, about the leggs, and other parts of it was bound strings, and brace|lets of fine white Beads; there was also by it a little Bow, a|bout three quarters long, and some other odd knackes; we brought sundry of the pretiest things away with vs, and co|vered the Corps vp againe. After this, we digged in sundry like places, but found no more Corne, nor any things els but

graues: There was varietie of opinions amongst vs about the embalmed person; some thought it was an <HI>Indian</HI> Lord and King: others sayd, the <HI>Indians</HI> haue all blacke hayre, and never any was seene with browne or yellow hayre; some thought, it was a Christian of some speciall note, which had dyed amongst them, and they thus buried him to honour him; others thought, they had killed him, and did it in tri|umph over him. Whilest we were thus ranging and search|ing, two of the Saylers, which were newly come on the shore, by chance espied two houses, which had beene lately dwelt in, but the people were gone. They having their pee|ces, and hearing no body entred the houses, and tooke out some things, and du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st not stay but came againe and told vs; so some seaven or eight of vs went with them, and found how we had gone within a slight shot of them before. The houses were made with long yong Sapling trees, bended and both ends stucke into the ground; they were made round, like vnto an Arbour, and covered downe to the ground with thicke and well wrought matts, and the doore was not over a yard high, made of a matt to open; the chim|ney was a wide open hole in the top, for which they had a matt to cover it close when they pleased; one might stand and goe vpright in them, in the midst of them were foure little trunches knockt into the ground, and small stickes laid over, on which they hung their Pots, and what they had to seeth; round about the fire they lay on matts, which are their beds. The houses were double matted, for as they were mat|ted without, so were they within, with newer &amp; fairer matts. In the houses we found wooden Boules, Trayes &amp; Dishes, Earthen Pots, Hand baskets made of Crab shells, wrought together; also an English Paile or Bucket, it wanted a bayle, but it had two Iron eares: there was also Baskets of sundry sorts, bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ger and some lesser, finer and some courser: some were curiously wrought with blacke and white in pretie workes, and sundry other of their houshold stuffe: we found also two or three Deeres heads, one whereof had bin newly killed, for it was still fresh; there was also a company of
<PB N="13" REF="13">
Deeres feete, stuck vp in the houses, Harts hornes, and Eagles clawes, and sundry such like things there was: also two or three Baskets full of pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ched Acornes, peeces of fish, and a peece of a broyled Hering. We found also a little silke grasse, and a little Tobacco seed, with some other seeds which wee knew not; without was sundry bundles of Flags, and Sedge, B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll rushes, and other stuffe to make matts; there was thrust into an hollow tree, two or three peeces of Venison, but we thought it fitter for the Dogs then for vs: some of the best things we tooke away with vs, and left the houses standing still as they were, so it growing towards night, and the tyde almost spent, we hasted with our things downe to the Shal|lop, and got abourd that night, intending to haue brought some Beades, and other things to haue left in the houses, in signe of Peace, and that we meant to truk with them, but it was not done, by meanes of our hastie comming away from Cape Cod, but so soone as we can meete conveniently with them, we will giue them full satisfaction. Thus much of our second Discovery.</P>
<P>Having thus discovered this place, it was controversall a|mongst vs, what to doe touching our aboad and setling there; some thought it best for many reasons to abide there.</P>
<P>As first, that there was a convenient harbour for Boates, though not for Ships.</P>
<P>Secondly, Good Corne ground readie to our hands, as we saw by experience in the goodly corne it yeelded, which would againe agree with the ground, and be naturall seed for the same.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Cape Cod was like to be a place of good fishing, for we saw daily great Whales of the best kind for oyle and bone, come close aboord our Ship, and in fayre weather swim and play about vs; there was once one when the Sun shone warme, c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me and lay aboue water, as if she had beene dead, for a good while together, within halfe a Mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ket shot of the Ship, at which two were prepared to shoote, to see whether she would s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ir or no, he that gaue fire first, his Mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ket flew in peeces, both stocke and barrell, yet thankes be to
<PB N="14" REF="14">
God, neither he nor any man els was hurt with it, though many were there about, but when the Whale saw her time she gaue a snuffe and away.</P>
<P>Fourthly, the place was likely to be healthfull, secure, and de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ensible.</P>
<P>But the last and especiall reason was, that now the heart of Wint<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r and vnseasonable weather was come vpon vs, so that we could not goe vpon coasting and discovery, with|out danger of loosing men and Boat, vpon which would follow the overthrow of all, especially considering what va|riable windes and sodaine stormes doe there arise. Also cold and wett lodging had so taynted our people, for scarce any of vs were free from vehement coughs, as if they should con|tinue long in that estate, it would indanger the liues of ma|ny, and breed diseases and infection amongst vs. Againe, we had yet some Beere, Butter, Flesh, and other such victu|als left, which would quickly be all gone, and then we should haue nothing to comfort vs in the great labour and toyle we were like to vnder-goe at the first; It was also conceived, whilst we had competent victuals, that the Ship would stay with vs, but when that grew low, they would be gone, and let vs shift as we could.</P>
<P>Others againe, vrged greatly the going to <HI>Anguum</HI> or <HI>Angoum,</HI> a place twentie leagues off to the North-wards, which they had heard to be an excellent harbour for ships; better ground and better fishing. Secondly for any thing we knew, there might be hard by vs a farre better seate, and it should be a great hindrance to seate where wee should re|moue againe. Thirdly, The water was but in ponds, and it was thought there would be none in Summer, or very lit|tle. Fourthly, the water there must be fetched vp a steepe hill: but to omit many reasons and replies vsed heere a|bouts; It was in the ende concluded, to make some disco|very within the Bay, but in no case so farre as <HI>Angoum</HI>: be|sides, <HI>Robert Coppin</HI> our Pilot, made relation of a great Na|vigable River and good harbour in the other head land of this Bay, almost right over against <HI>Cape Cod,</HI> being a right

line, not much aboue eight leagues distant, in which hee had beene once: and because that one of the wild men with whom they had some trucking, stole a harping Iron from them, they called it theeuish harbour. And beyond that place they were enioyned not to goe, whereupon, a Company was chosen to goe out vppon a third discovery: whilest some were imployed in this discovery, it pleased God that Mistris <HI>White</HI> was brought a bed of a Sonne, which was called <HI>Pe|regrine.</HI></P>
<P>The fift day, we through Gods mercy escaped a great danger by the foolishnes of a Boy, one of <HI>Francis Billingtons</HI> Sonnes, who in his Fathers absence, had got Gun-powder, and had shot of a peice or two, and made squibs, and there being a fowling peice charged in his fathers Cabbin, shot her off in the Cabbin, there being a little barrell of powder halfe full, scattered in and about the Cabbin, the fire being within foure foote of the bed betweene the Deckes, and many s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ints and Iron things about the Cabbin, and many people about the fire, and yet by Gods mercy no harme done.</P>
<P>Wednesday the sixt of December, it was resolved our discoverers should set forth, for the day before was too fowle weather, and so they did, though it was well ore the day ere all things could be readie: So ten of our men were appointed who were of themselues willing to vndertake it, to wit, Cap|taine <HI>Standish,</HI> Maister <HI>Carver, William Bradford, Edward Winsloe, Iohn Tilley, Edward Tilley, Iohn Houland,</HI> and three of London, <HI>Richard Warren, Steeuen Hopkins</HI> and <HI>Edward Dotte,</HI> and two of our Sea-men, <HI>Iohn Alderton</HI> and <HI>Thomas En|glish,</HI> of the Ships Company there went two of the Masters Mates, Master <HI>Clarke</HI> and Master <HI>Copin,</HI> the Master Gun|ner, and three Saylers. The narration of which Discovery, followes, penned by one of the Company.</P>
<P>Wednesday the sixt of December wee set out, being very cold and hard weather, wee were a long while after we lun|ched from the ship, before we could get cleare of a sandie poynt, which lay within lesse then a fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">long of the same.

We then directed our course along the Sea-sands, to the place where we first saw the <HI>Indians,</HI> when we were there, we saw it was also a <HI>Grampus</HI> which they were cutting vp, they cut it into long rands or peeces, about an ell long, and two handfull broad, wee found here and there a peece scattered by the way, as it seemed, for hast: this place the most were minded we should call, the <HI>Grampus Bay,</HI> be|cause we found so many of them there: wee followed the tract of the <HI>Indians</HI> bare feete a good way on the sands, as length we saw where they strucke into the Woods by the side of a Pond, as wee went to view the place, one sayd, hee thought hee saw an <HI>Indian</HI>-house among the trees, so went vp to see: and here we and the Shallop lost sight one of another till night, it being now about nine or ten a clocke, so we light on a path, but saw no house, and followed a great way into the woods, at length wee found where Corne had beene set, but not that yeare, anone we found a great bury|ing place, one part whereof was incompassed with a large Palazado, like a Church-yard, with yong spires foure or fiue yards long, set as close one by another as they could two o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> three foot in the ground, within it was full of Graues, some bigger, and some lesse, some were also paled about &amp; others had like an <HI>Indian</HI>-house made over them, but not matted those Graues were more sumptuous then those at <HI>Corne-hill,</HI> yet we digged none of them vp, but onely viewed them, and went our way; without the Palazado were graues also, but not so costly: from this place we went and found more Corne ground, but not of this yeare.

found two Baskets full of parched Acorns hid in the ground, which we supposed had beene Corne when we beganne to dig the same, we cast earth thereon againe &amp; went our way. All this while we saw no people, wee went ranging vp and downe till the Sunne began to draw low, and then we hasted out of the woods, that we might come to our Shallop, which when we were out of the woods, we espied a great way off, and call'd them to come vnto vs, the which they did as soone as they could, for it was not yet high water, they were ex|ceeding glad to see vs, (for they feared because they had not seene vs in so long a time) thinking we would haue kept by the shore side, so being both weary and faint, for we had ea|ten nothing all that day, we sell to make our Randevous and get <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ire wood, which alwayes cost vs a great deale of labour, by that time we had done &amp; our Shallop come to vs, it was within night, and we fed vpon such victualls as we had, and betooke vs to our rest, after we had set out our watch. About midnight we heard a great and hideous cry, and our Senti|nell called, <HI>Arme, Arme.</HI> So we bestirred our selues and shot off a couple of Muskets, and noyse ceased; we concluded, that it was a company of Wolues or Foxes, for one told vs, hee had heard such a noyse in <HI>New-found land.</HI> About fiue a clocke in the morning wee began to be stirring, and two or three which doubted whether their Peeces would goe off or no made tryall of them, and shot them off, but thought nothing at all, after Prayer we prepared our selues for brek-fast, and for a journey, and it being now the twilight in the morning, it was thought meet to carry the things downe to the Shal|lop: some sayd, it was not best to carry the Armour downe, others sayd, they would be readier, two or three sayd, they would not carry theirs, till they went themselues, but mis|trusting nothing at all: as it fel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> out, the water not being high enough, they layd the things downe vpon the shore &amp; came vp to brek fast.

So after wee had given God thankes for our deli|verance, wee tooke our Shallop and went on our Iourney, and called this place, <HI>The first Encounter,</HI> from hence we in|tended to haue sayled to the aforesayd theeuish Harbour, if wee found no convenient Harbour by the way, having the wind good, we sayled all that day along the Coast about 15. leagues, but saw neither River nor Creeke to put into, af|ter we had sayled an houre or two, it began to snow and raine, and to be bad weather; about the midst of the after|noone, the winde increased and the Seas began to be very rough, and the hinges of the rudder broke, so that we could steere no longer with it, but two men with much adoe were same to serue with a couple of Oares, the Seas were growne so great, that we were much troubled and in great daunger, and night grew on: Anon Master <HI>Coppin</HI> bad vs be of good cheere he saw the Harbour, as we drew neare, the gale be|ing stiffe, and we bearing great sayle to get in, split our Mast in 3. peices, and were like to haue cast away our Shallop, yet by Gods mercy recovering our selues, wee had the floud with vs, and struck into the Harbour.</P>
<P>Now he that thought that had beene the place was decei|ved, it being a place where not any of vs had beene before, and comming into the Harbour, he that was our Pilot did beare vp North-ward, which if we had continued wee had

beene cast away, yet still the Lord kept vs, and we bare vp for an Iland before vs, and recovering of that Iland, being compassed about with many Rocks, and darke night grow|ing vpon vs, it pleased the Divine providence that we fell vpon a place of sandy ground, where our Shallop did ride safe and secure all that night, and comming vpon a strange Iland kept our watch all night in the raine vpon that Iland: and in the morning we marched about it, &amp; found no Inha|bitants at all, and here wee made our Randevous all that day being Saturday, 10. of December, on the Sabboth day wee rested, and on Munday we sounded the Harbour, and found it a uery good Harbour for our shipping, we marched also into the Land, and found divers corne fields, and little run|ning brookes&punc; a place very good for scituation, so we retur|ned to our Ship againe with good newes to the rest of our people, which did much comfort their hearts.</P>
<P>On the fifteenth day, we waighed Anchor, to goe to the place we had discovered, and comming within two leagues of the Land, we could not fetch the Harbour, but were faine to put roome againe towards <HI>Cape Cod,</HI> our course lying West; and the wind was at North west, but it pleased God that the next day being Saturday the 16. day, the winde came faire, and wee put to Sea againe, and came safely into a safe Harbour; and within halfe an houre the winde changed, so as if we had beene letted but a little, we had gone backe to <HI>Cape Cod.</HI> This Harbour is a Bay greater then <HI>Cape Cod,</HI> compassed with a goodly Land, and in the Bay, 2. fine Ilands vninhabited, wherein are nothing but wood, Okes, Pines, Wal-nut, Beech, Sasifras, Vines, and other trees which wee know not; This Bay is a most hopefull place, innumerable store of fowle, and excellent good, and cannot but bee of fish in their seasons: Skote, Cod, Turbot, and Herring, wee haue tasted of, abundance of Musles the greatest &amp; best that ever we saw; Crabs, and Lobsters, in their time infinite, It is in fashion like a Cikle or Fish-hooke.</P>
<P>Munday the 13. day, we went a land, manned with the Maister of the Ship, and 3. or 4. of the Saylers, we marched
<PB N="22" REF="18">
along the coast in the woods, some 7. or 8. mile, but saw not an <HI>Indian</HI> nor an <HI>Indian</HI> house, only we found where former|ly, had beene some Inhabitants, and where they had planted their corne: we found not any Navigable River, but 4. or 5. small <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">unning brookes of very sweet fresh water, that all run into the Sea: The Land for the crust of the earth is a spits depth, excellent blacke mold and fat in some places, 2. or 3. great Oakes but not very thicke, Pines, Wal-nuts Beech Ash, Birch, Hasell, Holley, Asp, Sasifras, in abundance, &amp; Vines euery where, Cherry trees, Plum trees, and many other which we know not; many kinds of hearbes, we found heere in Winter, as Strawbery leaues innumerable, Sorrell, Yarow, Caruell, Brook-lime, Liver-wort, Water-cresses, great store of Leekes, and Onyons, and an excellent strong kind of Flaxe, and Hempe; here is sand, gravell, and excel|lent clay no better in the Worlde, excellent for pots, and will wash like sope, and great store of stone, though some|what soft, and the best water that ever we drunke, and the Brookes now begin to be full of fish; that night many being weary with marching, wee went abourd againe.</P>
<P>The next morning being Tuesday the 19. of December, wee went againe to discover further; some went on Land, and some in the Shallop, the Land we found as the former day we did, and we found a Creeke, and went vp three En|glish myles, a very pleasant river at full Sea, a Barke of thirty tunne may goe vp, but at low water scarce our Shallop could passe: this place we had a great liking to plant in, but that it was so farre from our fishing our principall profit, and so incompassed with woods, that we should bee in much dan|ger of the Salvages, and our number being so little, and so much ground to cleare, so as wee thought good to quit and cleare that place, till we were of more strength; some of vs hauing a good minde for safety to plant in the greater Ile, wee crossed the Bay which there is fiue or sixe myles ouer, and found the Ile about a myle and a halfe, or two myles a|bout, all wooded, and no fresh water but 2. or 3. pits, that we doubted of fresh water in Summer, and so full of wood,

as we could hardly cleare so much as to serue vs for Corne, besides wee iudged it colde for our Corne, and some part very rockie, yet diuers thought of it as a place defensible, and of great securitie.</P>
<P>That night we returned againe a ship boord, with resolu|tion the next morning to setle on some of those places, so in the morning, after we had called on God for direction, we came to this resolution, to goe presently ashore againe, and to take a better view of two places, which wee thought most fitting for vs, for we could not now take time for further search or consideration, our victuals being much spent, espe|cially, our Beere, and it being now the 19. of <HI>December.</HI> Af|ter our landing and viewing of the places, so well as we could we came to a conclusion, by most voyces, to set on the maine Land, on the first place, on an high ground, where there is a great deale of Land cleared, and hath beene planted with Corne three or foure yeares agoe, and there is a very sweet brooke runnes vnder the hill side, and many delicate springs of as good water as can be drunke, and where we may har|bour our Shallops and Boates exceeding well, and in this brooke much good fish in their seasons: on the further side of the river also much Corne ground cleared, in one field is a great hill, on which wee poynt to make a plat-forme, and plant our Ordinance, which will command all round about, from thence we may see into the <HI>Bay,</HI> and farre into the Sea, and we may see thence <HI>Cape Cod</HI>: our greatest labour will be fetching of our wood, which is halfe a quarter of an English myle, but there is enough so farre off; what people inhabite here we yet know not, for as yet we haue seene none, so there we made our Randevous, and a place for some of our people about twentie, resolving in the morning to come all ashore, and to build houses, but the next morning being Thursday the 21. of <HI>December,</HI> it was stormie and wett, that we could not goe ashore, and those that remained there all night could doe nothing, but were wet, not having dai-light enough to make them a sufficient court of gard, to keepe them dry. All that night it blew and rayned extreamely&punc;
<PB N="24" REF="19">
it was so tempestuous, that the Shallop could not goe on land so soone as was meet, for they had no victuals on land.

<P>Friday the 22. the storme still continued, that we could not get a-land, nor they come to vs aboord: this morning Good wife <HI>Alderton</HI> was delivered of a sonne, but dead borne.</P>
<P>Saturday the 23. so many of vs as could, went on shore, felled and carried tymber, to provide themselues stuffe for building.</P>
<P>Sunday the 24. our people on shore heard a cry of some Savages (as they thought) which caused an Alarm, and to stand on their gard, expecting an assault, but all was quiet.</P>
<P>Munday the 25. day, we went on shore, some to fell tymber, some to saw, some to ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, and some to carry, so no man rested all that day, but towards night some as they were at worke, heard a noyse of some <HI>Indians,</HI> which caused vs all to goe to our Muskets, but we heard no further, so we came aboord againe, and left some twentie to keepe the court of gard; that night we had a sore storme of winde and rayne.</P>
<P>Munday the 25. being Christmas day, we began to drinke water aboord, but at night the Master caused vs to haue some Beere, and so on boord we had diverse times now and then some Beere, but on shore none at all.</P>
<P>Tuesday the 26. it was foule weather, that we could not goe ashore.</P>
<P>Wednesday the 27. we went to worke againe.</P>

Families they were, willing all single men that had no wiues to ioyne with some Familie, as they thought fit, that so we might build fewer houses, which was done, and we reduced them to 19. Families; to greater Families we allotted larger plots, to every person halfe a pole in breadth, and three in length, and so Lots were cast where euery man should lie, which was done, and staked out; we thought this propor|tion was large enough at the first, for houses and gardens, to impale them round, considering the weaknes of our peo|ple, many of them growing ill with coldes, for our former Discoveries in frost and stormes, and the wading at Cape <HI>Cod</HI> had brought much weakenes amongst vs, which increa|sed so every day more and more, and after was the cause of many of their deaths.</P>
<P>Fryday and Saturday, we fitted our selues for our labour, but our people on shore were much troubled and discoura|ged with rayne and wett that day, being very stormie and cold; we saw great smokes of fire made by the <HI>Indians</HI> about six or seaven myles from vs as we coniectured.</P>
<P>Munday the first of <HI>Ianuary,</HI> we went betimes to worke, we were much hundred in lying so farre off from the Land, and faine to goe as the tyde served, that we lost much time, for our Ship drew so much water, that she lay a myle and al|most a halfe off, though a ship of seaventie or eightie tun as high water may come to the shore.</P>
<P>Wednesday the third of <HI>Ianuary,</HI> some of our people be|ing abroad, to get and gather thatch, they saw great fires of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and were at then Corne fields, yet saw none of the Savages, nor had seene any of them since wee came to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s Bay.</P>
<P>Thursday the fourth of <HI>Ianuary,</HI> Captaine <HI>Miles Standish</HI> with foure or fiue more, went to see if they could meet with any of the Savages in that place where the fires were made, they went to some of their houses, but not lately inhabited, yet could they not meete with any; as they came home, they shot at an Eagle and killed her, which was excellent meat; It was hardly to be discerned from Mutton.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="20">Fryday the fifth of <HI>Ianuary,</HI> one of the Saylers found aliue vpon the shore an Hering, which the Master had to his sup|per, which put vs in hope of fish, but as yet we had got but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Cod; we wanted small hookes.</P>
<P>Saturday the sixt of <HI>Ianuary,</HI> Master <HI>Marten</HI> was very sicke, and to our iudgement, no hope of life, so Master <HI>Carver</HI> was sent for to come abourd to speake with him about his ac|compts, who came the next morning.</P>
<P>Munday the eight day of <HI>Ianuary,</HI> was a very fayre day, and we went betimes to worke, master <HI>Iones</HI> sent the Shallop as he had formerly done, to see where fish could be got, they had a great storme at Sea, and were in some danger, at night they returned with three great Seales, and an excellent good Cod, which did assure vs that we should haue plentie of fish shortly.</P>
<P>This day, <HI>Francis Billington,</HI> having the weeke before seene from the top of a tree on an hie hill, a great sea as he thought, went with one of the Masters mates to see it, they went three myles, and then came to a great water, devided into two great Lakes, the bigger of them fiue or sixe myles in circuit, and in it an Ile of a Cable length square, the other three miles in compasse; in their estimation they are fine fresh water, full of fish, and foule; a brooke issues from it, it will be an ex|cellent helpe for vs in time. They found seaven or eight <HI>Indian</HI> houses, but not lately inhabited, when they saw the houses they were in some feare, for they were but two persons and one peece.</P>
<P>Tuesday the 9. Ianuary, was a reasonable faire day, and wee went to labour that day in the building of our Towne, in two rowes of houses for more safety: we devided by lott the plot of ground whereon to build our Towne: Af|ter the proportion formerly allotted, wee agreed that every man should build his owne house, thinking by that course, men would make more hast then working in common: the common house, in which for the first, we made our Rende|vous, being neere finished wanted onely couering, it being about 20. foote square, some should make morter, and

some gather thatch, so that in foure dayes halfe of it was that|ched, frost and foule weather hindred vs much, this time of the yeare seldome could wee worke halfe the weeke.</P>
<P>Thursday the eleuenth, <HI>William Bradford</HI> being at worke, (for it was a faire day) was vehemently taken with a griefe and paine, and so shot to his huckle-bone; It was doubted that he would haue instantly dyed, hee got colde in the for|mer discoveries, especially the last, and felt some paine in his anckles by times, but he grew a little better towards night and in time through Gods mercie in the vse of meanes reco|vered.</P>
<P>Friday the 12. we went to worke, but about noone, it began to raine, that it forced vs to giue over worke.</P>
<P>This day, two of our people put vs in great sorrow and care, there was 4. sent to gather and cut thatch in the mor|ning, and two of them, <HI>Iohn Goodman</HI> and <HI>Peter Browne,</HI> having cut thatch all the fore noone, went to a further place, and willed the other two, to binde vp that which was cut and to follow them; so they did, being about a myle and an halfe from our Plantation: but when the two came af|ter, they could not finde them, nor heare any thing of them at all, though they hallowed and shouted as loud as they could, so they returned to the Company and told them of it: whereupon Master <HI>Leaver</HI> &amp; three or foure more went to seeke them, but could heare nothing of them, so they retur|ning, sent more, but that night they could heare nothing at all of them: the next day they armed 10. or 12. men out, verily thinking the <HI>Indians</HI> had surprised them, they went seeking 7. or 8 myles, but could neither see nor heare any thing at all, so they returned with much discomfort to vs all.

They are much in|censed and provoked against the English, and about eyght moneths agoe slew three English men and two more hardly escaped by flight to <HI>Monhiggon</HI>; they were Sir <HI>Ferdinando Gorge</HI> his men, as this Savage told vs, as he did likewise of the <HI>Huggerie,</HI> that is, <HI>Fight,</HI> that our discoverers had with the <HI>Nausites,</HI> &amp; of our tooles that were taken out of the woods, which we willed him should be brought againe, otherwise, we would right our selues. These people are ill affected to|wards the English, by reason of one <HI>Hunt,</HI> a master of a ship, who deceived the people, and got them vnder colour of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ruk|ing with them, twentie out of this very place where we inha|bite, and seaven men from the <HI>Nausites,</HI> and carried them away, and sold them for slaues like a wretched man (for 20. pound a man) that cares not what mischiefe he doth for hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> profit.</P>
<P>Saturday in the morning we dismissed the Salvage, and gaue him a knife, a bracelet, and a ring; he promised within a night or two to come againe&punc; and to bring with him some of the <HI>Massasoyts</HI> our neighbours, with such Beuers skins as they had to trucke with vs.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="25">Saturday and Sunday reasonable fayre dayes. On this day came againe the Savage, and brought with him fiue other tall proper men, they had every man a Deeres skin on him, and the principall of them had a wild Cats skin, or such like on the one arme; they had most of them long hosen vp to their groynes, close made; and aboue their groynes to their wast another leather, they were altogether like the <HI>Irish</HI>-trou|ses; they are of complexion like our English Gipseys, no haire or very little on their faces, on their heads long haire to their shoulders, onely cut before some trussed vp before with a feather, broad wise, like a fanne, another a fox tayle hanging out: these left (according to our charge giuen him before) their Bowes and Arrowes a quarter of a myle from our Towne, we gaue them entertaynement as we thought was sitting them, they did eate liberally of our English victuals, they made semblance vnto vs of friendship and amitie; they song &amp; danced after their maner like Anticks; they brought with them in a thing like a Bow-case (which the principall of them had about his wast) a little of their Corne pownded to Powder, which put to a little water they eate; he had a little Tobacco in a bag, but none of them drunke but when he li|sted, some of them had their faces paynted blacke, from the forehead to the chin, foure or fiue fingers broad; others af|ter other fashions, as they liked; they brought three or foure skins, but we would not trucke with them at all that day, but wished them to bring more, and we would trucke for all, which they promised within a night or two, and would leaue these behind them, though we were not willing they should, and they brought vs all our tooles againe which were taken in the Woods, in our mens absence, so because of the day we dismissed them so soone as we could. But <HI>Samoset</HI> our first acquaintance, eyther was sicke, or fayned himselfe so, and would not goe with them and stayed with vs till Wednesday morning: Then we sent him to them, to know the reason they came not according to their words, and we gaue him an hat, a payre of stockings and shooes, a shirt, and a peece of cloth to tie about his wast.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="25">The Sabboth day, when we sent them from vs, wee gaue every one of them some trifles, especially, the principall of them, we carried them along with our Armes to the place where they left their Bowes and Arrowes, whereat they were amazed, and two of them began to slinke away, but that the other called them, when they tooke their Arrowes, we bad them farewell, and they were glad, and so with ma|ny thankes giuen vs they departed, with promise they would come againe.</P>

<P>That day we had againe a meeting, to conclude of lawes and orders for our selues, and to confirme those Military Orders that were formerly propounded, and twise broken off by the Savages comming, but so we were againe the third time, for after we had beene an houre together, on the top of the hill over against vs two or three Savages presented them|selues, that made semblance of daring vs, as we thought, so Captaine <HI>Standish</HI> with another, with their Muskets went o|ver to them, with two of the masters mates that follows them without Armes, having two Muskets with them, they wher|ted and rubbed their Arrowes and Strings, and made shew of defiance, but when our men drew nere them, they ranne away.

<P>Thursday the 22. of <HI>March,</HI> was a very fayre warme day.

We sent to the King a payre of Kniues, and a Cop|per Chayne, with a Iewell at it. To <HI>Quadequina</HI> we sent likewise a Knife and a Iewell to hang in his eare, and withall a Pot of strong water, a good quantitie of Bisket, and some butter, which were all willingly accepted: our Messenger made a speech vnto him, that King IAMES saluted him with words of loue and Peace, and did accept of him as his Friend and Alie, and that our Governour desired to see him and to trucke with him, and to confirme a Peace with him, as his next neighbour: he liked well of the speech and heard it attentiuely&punc; though the Interpreters did not well expresse it; after he had eaten and drunke himselfe, and giuen the rest to his company, he looked vpon our messengers sword and armour which he had on, with intimation of his desire to buy it, but on the other side, our messenger shewed his vnwil|lingnes to part with it: In the end he left him in the custodie of <HI>Quadequina</HI> his brother, and came over the brooke, and some twentie men following him, leaving all their Bowes and Arrowes behind them. We kept six or seaven as hostages for our messenger; Captaine <HI>Standish</HI> and master <HI>Williamson</HI> met the King at the brooke, with halfe a dosen Musketiers, they saluted him and he them, so one going over, the one on the one side, and the other on the other, conducted him to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> house then in building, where we placed a greene Rugge, and three or foure Cushions, then instantly came our

The Governour called for some strong water, and drunke to him, and he drunke a great draught that made him sweate all the while after, he called for a little fresh meate, which the King did eate willingly, and did giue his followers.

<P>Lastly, that doing thu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, King IAMES would esteeme of him as his friend and Alie: all which the King seemed to like well, and it was applauded of his followers, all the while he sat by the Governour he trembled for feare: In his per|son he is a very lustie man, in his best yeares, an able body, graue of countenance, and spare of speech: In his Attyre little or nothing differing from the rest of his followers, on|ly in a great Chaine of white bone Beades about his necke, and at it behinde his necke, hangs a little bagg of Tobacco, which he dranke and gaue vs to drinke; his face was payn|ted with a sad red like murry, and oyled both head and face, that hee looked greasily; All his followers likewise, were in their faces, in part or in whole painted, some blacke, some

red, some yellow, and some white, some with crosses, and other Antick workes, some had skins on them, and some naked, all strong, tall, all men in appearance: so after all was done, the Governour conducted him to the Brooke, and there they embraced each other and he departed: we dili|gently keeping our hostages, wee expected our messengers comming, but anon word was brought vs, that <HI>Quaddequina</HI> was comming, and our messenger was stayed till his returne, who presently came and a troupe with him, so likewise wee entertained him, and convayed him to the place prepared; he was very fearefull of our peeces, and made signes of dis|like, that they should be carried away, whereupon Comman|dement was given, they should be layd away. He was a ve|ry proper tall young man, of a very modest and seemely countenance, and he did kindely like of our entertainement, so we convayed him likewise as wee did the King, but diuers of their people stayed still, when hee was returned, then they dismissed our messenger. Two of his people would haue stayed all night, but we would not suffer it: one thing I for|got, the King had in his bosome hanging in a string, a great long knife, hee marveiled much at our Trumpet, and some of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">men would sound it as well as they could, <HI>Samoset</HI> and <HI>Squanto,</HI> they stayed al night with vs, and the King and al his men lay all night in the woods, not aboue halfe an English myle from vs, and all their wiues and women with them, they sayd that within 8. or 9. dayes, they would come and set corne on the other side of the Brooke, and dwell there all Summer, which is hard by vs: That night we kept good watch, but there was no appearance of danger; the next morning divers of their people came over to vs, hoping to get some victuales as wee imagined, som of them told vs the King would haue some of vs come see him; Captaine <HI>Stan|dish</HI> and <HI>Isaack Alderton</HI> went venterously, who were wel|commed of him after their manner: he gaue them three or foure ground Nuts, and some Tobacco.

<P>Fryday was a very faire day, <HI>Samoset</HI> and <HI>Squanto</HI> still re|mained with vs, <HI>Squanto</HI> went at noone to fish for Eeles, at night he came home with as many as he could well lift in one hand, which our people were glad of, they were fat &amp; sweet, he trod them out with his feete, and so caught them with his hands without any other Instrument,</P>
<P>This day we proceeded on with our common businesse, from which we had beene so often hindred by the Salvage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> comming, and concluded both of Military orders, and of some Lawes and Orders as wee thought be|hoofefull for our present estate, and condition, and did likewise choose our Governour for this yeare, which was Master <HI>Iohn Carver</HI> a man well approo|ved amongst vs.</P>

<P>_IT seemed good to the Company for ma|ny considerations to send some amongst them to <HI>Massasoyt,</HI> the greatest Com|mander amongst the Savages, borde|ring about vs; partly to know where to find them, if occasion served, as also to see their strength, discover the Country, prevent abuses in their disorderly comming vnto vs, make satisfaction for some conceived jniuries to be done on our parts, and to continue the league of Peace and Friendship betweene them and vs. For these, and the like ends, it pleased the Governour to make choice of <HI>Steven Hopkins,</HI> &amp; <HI>Edward Winslo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> to goe vnto him, and having a fit opportunitie, by reason of a Savage, called <HI>Tisquantum</HI> (that could speake English) comming vnto vs; with all expedition provided a Horse-mans coat, of red Cotton, and laced with a slight lace for a present, that both they and their message might be the more acceptable amongst them. The Message was as fol|loweth; That forasmuch as his subiects came often and without feare, vpon all occasions amongst vs, so wee were now come vnto him, and in witnesse of the loue and good will the English beare vnto him, the Governour hath sent him a coat, desiring that the Peace and Amitte that was

betweene them and vs might be continued, not that we fea|red them, but because we intended not to iniure any, desiring to liue peaceably: and as with all men, so especially with them our neerest neighbours. But whereas his people came very often, and very many together vnto vs, bringing for the most part their wiues and children with them, they were well come; yet we being but strangers as yet at <HI>Patuxet, alias New Plimmoth,</HI> and not knowing how our Corne might prosper, we could no longer giue them such entertainment as we had done, and as we desired still to doe: yet if he would be pleased to come himselfe, or any speciall friend of his desired to see vs, comming from him they should be well|come; and to the end wee might know them from others, our Governour had sent him a copper Chayne, desiring if a|ny Messenger should come from him to vs, we might know him by bringing it with him, and hearken and giue credite to his Message accordingly. Also requesting him that such as haue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">kin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, should bring them to vs, and that he would hinder the multitude from oppressing vs with them.

And last of all, our Gouernour requested one favour of him, which was, that he would exchange some of their Corne for seede with us, that we might make tryall which best agreed with the foyle where we liue.</P>
<P>With these presents and message we set forward the tenth Iune, about 9. a clocke in the Morning, our guide resol|ving that night to rest at <HI>Namasches,</HI> a Towne vnder <HI>Massa|soyt,</HI> and conceived by vs to bee very neere, because the
<PB N="42" REF="29">
Inhabitants flocked so thicke vpon every slight occasion a|mongst vs: but wee found it to bee some fifteene English myles. On the way we found some ten or twelue men wo|men and children, which had pestered vs, till wee were wea|rie of them, perceiving that (as the manner of them all is) where victuall is easiliest to be got, there they liue, especially in the Summer: by reason whereof our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay affording ma|ny Lobsters, they resort every spring tide thither: &amp; now re|turned with vs to <HI>Namaschet.</HI> Thither we came about 3. a clock after noone&punc; the Inhabitants entertaining vs with ioy, in the best manner they could, giving vs a kinde of bread cal|led by them <HI>Maixium,</HI> and the spawne of Shade, which then they got in abundance, in so much as they gaue vs spoones to eate them, with these they boyled mustie Acorns, but of the Shads we eate heartily. After this they desired one of our men to shoote at a Crow, complaining what damage they sustained in their Corne by them, who shooting some fourescore off and killing, they much admired it, as other shots on other occasions. After this <HI>Tisquantum</HI> told vs we should hardly in one day reach <HI>Pakanokick,</HI> moving vs to goe some 8. myles further, where we should finde more store and better victuals then there: Being willing to hasten our Iourney we went, and came thither at Sunne setting, where we found many of the <HI>Namaschecks</HI> (they so calling the men of <HI>Namaschet</HI>) fishing vppon a Ware which they had made on a River which belonged to them, where they caught a|bundance of Basse. These welcommed vs also, gaue vs of their fish, and we them of our victuals, not doubting but w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> should haue enough where ere we came. There we lodged in the open fieldes: for houses they had none, though they spent the most of the Summer there. The head of this Ri|ver is reported to bee not farre from the place of our abode, vpon it are, and haue beene many Townes, it being a good length. The ground <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> good on both sides, it being for the most part cleered: Thousands of men have lived there, which dyed in a great plague not long since: and pitty it was and is to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ee, so many goodly, fieldes, &amp; so well seated, with|out

<P>But to returne to our Iourney: The next morning wee brake our fast, tooke our leaue and departed, being then ac|companied with some sixe Salvages, having gone about sixe myles by the Riverside, at a knowne shole place, it beeing low water, they spake to vs to put off our breeches, for wee must wade thorow. Heere let me not forget the vallour and courrage of some of the Salvage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, on the opposite side of the river, for there were remaining aliue only 2. men, both aged, especially the one being aboue threescore; These two espy|ing a company of men entring the River, ran very swiftly &amp; low in the grasse to meete vs at the banck, where with sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll voyces and great courage standing charged vppon vs with their bowes, they demaunded what we were, supposing vs to be enemies, and thinking to take advantage on vs in the water: but seeing we were friends, they welcommed vs with such foode as they had, and we bestowed a small bracelet of Beades on them. Thus farre wee are sure the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ide <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bs and flowes.</P>
<P>Having here againe refreshed our selves we proceeded in our Iourney, the weather being very hote for travell, yet the Country so well watered that a man could scarce be drie, but he should haue a spring at hand to coole his thirst, beside smal Rivers in abundance: But the Salvages will not willingly drinke, but at a spring head. When wee came to any small Brooke where no bridge was, two of them desired to carry vs through of their owne accords, also fearing wee were or would be weary, offered to carry our peeces, also if we would lay off any of our clothes, we should haue them carried: and as the one of them had found more speciall kindnesse from one of the Messengers, and the other Salvage from the other so they shewed their thankefulnesse accordingly in affor|ding
<PB N="44" REF="30">
v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> all helpe, and furtherance in the Iourney.</P>
<P>As we passed along, we observed that there were few pla|ces by the River, but had beene inhabited, by reason where|of, much ground was cleare, saue of weedes which grewe higher then our heads. There is much good Timber both Oake, Wallnut-tree, Firre, Beech, and exceeding great Chessnut-trees. The Country in respect of the lying of it, is both Champani<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and hilly, like many places in England. In some places its very rockie both aboue ground and in it: And though the Countrey bee wilde and over-growne with woods, yet the trees stand not thicke, but a man may well ride a horse amongst them.</P>
<P>Passing on at length, one of the Company an <HI>Indian</HI> espi|ed a man, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">old the rest of it, we asked them if they fea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed any, they told vs that if they were <HI>Narrohigganset,</HI> men they would not trust them, whereat, we called for our peeces and bid them not to feare; for though they were twenty, we two alone would not care for them: but they hayling him, hee prooved a friend, and had onely two women with him: their baskets were empty, but they fetched water in their bottels, so that we dranke with them and departed.

<P>After wee came to a Towne of <HI>Massasoyts,</HI> where we eat Oysters and other fish.

<P><HI>Massasoyt</HI> being come, wee discharged our Peeces, and

saluted him, who after their manner kindly well commed vs, and tooke vs into his house, and set vs downe by him, where having delivered our foresayd Message, and Presents, and having put the Coat on his backe, and the Chayne about his necke, he was not a little proud to behold himselfe, and his men also to see their King so brauely attyred.</P>
<P>For answere to our Message, he told vs we were well-come, and he would gladly continue that Peace and Friendship which was betweene him &amp; vs: and for his men they should no more pester vs as they had done: Also, that he would send to <HI>Paomet,</HI> and would helpe vs with Corne for seed, ac|cording to our request.</P>
<P>This being done his men gathered neere to him, to whom he turned himselfe, and made a great Speech; they some|time interposing, and as it were, confirming and applauding him in that he sayd. The meaning whereof was (as farre as we could learne) thus; Was not he <HI>Massasoyt</HI> Comman|der of the Countrey about them? Was not such a Towne his and the people of it? and should they not bring their skins vnto vs? To which they answered, they were his &amp; would be at peace with vs, and bring their skins to vs. After this manner, he named at least thirtie places, and their answere was as aforesayd to every one: so that as it was delightfull, it was tedious vnto vs.</P>
<P>This being ended, he lighted Tobacco for vs, and fell to discoursing of <HI>England,</HI> &amp; of the Kings Maiestie, marvayling that he would liue without a wife. Also he talked of the French-men, bidding vs not to suffer them to come to <HI>Nar|rohiganset,</HI> for it was King IAMES his Countrey, and he al|so was King IAMES his man. Late it grew, but victualls he offered none; for indeed he had not any, being he came so newly home. So we desired to goe to rest: he layd vs on the bed with himselfe and his wife, they at the one end and we at the other, it being onely plancks layd a foot from the ground, and a thin Mat vpon them. Two more of his chiefe men for want of roome pressed by and vpon vs; so that we were worse weary of our lodging then of our iourney.</P>

<P>_THe 11^th of <HI>Iune</HI> we set forth, the weather being very faire: but ere we had bin long at Sea, there arose a storme of wind and raine, with much lightning and thunder, in so much that a spout arose not far from vs: but God be praysed, it dured not long, and we put in that night for Harbour at a place, called <HI>Cummaquid,</HI> where wee had some hope to finde the Boy.

In the morning we espied Savages seeking Lob|sters, and sent our two Interpreters to speake with them, the channell being betweene them; where they told them what we were, and for what we were come, willing them not at all to feare vs, for we would not hurt them. Their answere was, that the Boy was well, but he was at <HI>Nauset</HI>; yet since wee were there they desired vs to come ashore &amp; eate with them: which as soone as our Boat floated we did: and went sixe a|shore, having foure pledges for them in the Boate. They brought vs to their Sachim or Gouernour, whom they call
<PB N="50" REF="33">
<HI>Iyanough,</HI> a man not exceeding twentie-six yeeres of age, but very personable, gentle, courteous, and fayre conditioned, indeed not like a Savage, saue for his attyre; his entertaine|ment was answerable to his parts, and his cheare plentifull and various.</P>
<P>One thing was very grieuous vnto vs at this place; There was an old woman, whom we iudged to be no lesse then an hundred yeeres old, which came to see vs because shee neuer saw English, yet could not behold vs without breaking forth into great passion, weeping and crying excessiuely. We de|maunding the reason of it, they told vs, she had three sons, who when master <HI>Hunt</HI> was in these parts went aboord his Ship to trade with him, and he carried them Captiues into Spaine (for <HI>Tisquantum</HI> at that time was carried away also) by which meanes shee was depriued of the comfort of her children in her old age. We told them we were sorry that any English man should giue them that offence, that <HI>Hunt</HI> was a bad man, and that all the English that heard of it con|demned him for the same: but for vs we would not offer them any such iniury, though it would gaine vs all the skins in the Countrey. So we gaue her some small trifles, which somewhat appeased her.</P>
<P>After dinner we tooke Boat for <HI>Nauset, Iyanough</HI> and two of his men accompanying vs. Ere we came to <HI>Nauset,</HI> the day and tyde were almost spent, in so much as we could not goe in with our Shallop: but the Sachim or Governour of <HI>Comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">quid</HI> went a shore and his men with him, we also sent <HI>Tisquantum</HI> to tell <HI>Aspinet</HI> the Sachim of <HI>Nauset</HI> wherefore we came. The Sauages here came very thicke amongst vs, and were earnest with vs to bring in our Boate. But we nei|ther well could, nor yet desired to doe it, because we had lest cause to trust them, being they onely had formerly made an Assault vpon vs in the same place, in time of our Winter Discouery for Habitation.

So they de|parted from vs.</P>
<P>Here we vnderstood, that the <HI>Narrohigansets</HI> had spoyled some of <HI>Massasoyts</HI> men, and taken him. This strucke some feare in vs, because the Colony was so weakely guarded, the strength thereof being abroad: But we set foorth with resolution to make the best hast home wee could; yet the winde being contrary, having scarce any fresh water least, and at least 16. leagues home, we put in againe for the shore. There we met againe with <HI>Iyanough</HI> the <HI>Sachim</HI> of <HI>Cu~maquid,</HI> and the most of his Towne, both men women &amp; children with him.

<P><PB N="54" REF="35">Vpon this Newes the Company assembled together, and resolued on the morrow to send ten men armed to <HI>Namas|chet</HI> and <HI>Hobbamock,</HI> for their guide, to reuenge the supposed death of <HI>Tisquantum</HI> on <HI>Coubatant</HI> our bitter Enemy, and to retaine <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pcof,</HI> another Sachim or Gouernour, who was of this confederacy, till we heard, what was become of our friend <HI>Massasoyt.</HI></P>
<P>On the morrow we set out ten men Armed, who tooke their iourney as aforesayd, but the day proved very wett. When wee supposed we were within three or foure myles of <HI>Namaschet,</HI> we went out of the way and stayed there till night, because we would not be discouered. There we con|sulted what to doe, and thinking best to beset the house at mid-night, each was appointed his taske by the Captaine, all men incouraging one another, to the vtmost of their power.</P>
<P>By night our guide lost his way, which much discoura|ged our men, being we were wet, and weary of our armes: but one of our men hauing beene before at <HI>Namasch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t</HI> brought vs into the way againe.</P>
<P>Before we came to the Towne we sat downe and ate such as our Knapsacke affoorded, that being done, wee threw them aside, and all such things as might hinder vs, and so went on and beset the house, according to our last resolu|tion.

terrified all the Inhabitants, except <HI>Tisquantum</HI> and <HI>Tokama|hamon,</HI> who though they knew not our end in comming, yet assured them of our honesty, that we would not hurt them.

<P>For these ends the Governours chose ten men, fit for the purpose, and sent <HI>Tisquantum,</HI> and two other Salvages to bring vs to speech with the people, and interpret for vs.</P>
<P>We set out about mid-night, the tyde then seruing for vs; we supposing it to be neerer then it is, thought to be there the next morning betimes: but it proued well neere twentie Leagues from <HI>New Plimmouth.</HI></P>
<P>We came into the bottome of the Bay, but being late wee anchored and lay in the Shallop, not hauing seene any of the people. The next morning we put in for the shore. There we found many Lobsters that had beene gathered together by the Saluages, which we made ready vnder a cliffe. The Captaine set two Sentinels behind the cliffe to the landward to secure the Shallop, and taking a guide with him, and foure of our company, went to seeke the Inhabitants, where they met a woman comming for her Lobsters, they told her of them, and contented her for them. She told them where the people were; <HI>Tisquantum</HI> went to them, the rest returned, hauing direction which way to bring the Shallop to them.</P>
<P>The Sachim, or Gouernour of this place, is called <HI>Obba|tinewat,</HI> and though he liue in the bottome of the <HI>Massachu|set</HI> bay, yet he is vnder <HI>Massasoyt.</HI> He vsed vs very kindly, he told vs, he durst not then remaine in any setled place, for feare of the <HI>Terentines.</HI> Also the <HI>Squa Sachim,</HI> or <HI>Massa|chusets</HI> Queene was an enemy to him.</P>

<P>On the morrow we went ashore, all but two men and mar|ched in Armes vp in the Countrey. Hauing gone three myles, we came to a place where Corne had beene newly gathered, a house pulled downe, and the people gone. A myle from hence, <HI>Nanepashemet</HI> their King in his life time had liued. His house was not like others, but a scaffold was largely built, with pools and plancks some six foote from ground, and the house vpon that, being situated on the top of a hill.</P>
<P>Not farre from hence in a bottome, wee came to a Fort built by their deceased King, the manner thus; There were pools some thirtie or fortie foote long, stucke in the ground as thicke as they could be set one by another, and with these they inclosed a ring some forty or fifty foote ouer. A trench breast high was digged on each side; one way there was to goe into it with a bridge; in the midst of this Palli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ado stood the frame of an house, wherein being dead he lay buryed.</P>
<P>About a myle from hence, we came to such another, but seated on the top of an hill: here <HI>Nanepashemet</HI> was killed, none dwelling in it since the time of his death. At this place we stayed, and sent two Saluages to looke the Inhabitants, and to informe them of our ends in comming, that they might not be fearefull of vs: Within a myle of this place they found the women of the place together, with their Corne on heapes, whither we supposed them to be sted for feare of vs, and the more, because in diuers places they had newly pulled downe their houses, and for hast in one place had left some of their Corne couered with a Mat, and no bo|dy with it.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="37">With much feare they entertained vs at first, but seeing our gentle carriage towards them, they tooke heart and en|tertained vs in the best manner they could, boyling Cod and such other things as they had for vs. At length with much sending for came one of their men, shaking and trem|bling for feare. But when he saw we intended them no hurt, but came to trucke, he promised vs his skins also. Of him we enquired for their Queene, but it seemed shee was far from thence, at lest we could not see her.</P>
<P>Here <HI>Tisquantum</HI> would haue had vs rifled the Saluage wo|men, and taken their skins, and all such things as might be seruiceable for vs, for (sayd he) they are a bad people, and haue oft threatned you: But our answere was; Were they neuer so bad, we would not wrong them, or giue them any just occasion against vs: for their words we little weighed them, but if they once attempted any thing against vs, then we would deale far worse then he desired.</P>
<P>Hauing well spent the day, we returned to the Shallop, almost all the Women accompanying vs, to trucke, who sold their coats from their backes, and tyed boughes about them, but with great shamefastnesse (for indeed they are more modest then some of our English women are) we pro|mised them to come againe to them, and they vs, to keepe their skins.</P>
<P>Within this Bay, the Salvages say, there are two Riuers; the one whereof we saw, hauing a faire entrance, but we had no time to discouer it. Better harbours for shipping cannot be then here are. At the entrance of the Bay are many Rockes; and in all likelihood very good fishing ground. Many, yea, most of the Ilands haue beene inhabited, some being cleered from end to end, but the people are all dead, or remoued.</P>

<P>And although the most of the opposites are such as either dreame of raising their fortunes here, to that then which there is nothing more vnlike, or such as affecting their home-borne countrey so vehemently, as that they had ra|ther with all their friends begge, yea starue in it, the vnder|goe a little difficultie in seeking abroad, yet are there some who out of doubt in tendernesse of conscience, and feare to offend God by running before they be called, are straitned and doe straiten others, from going to forraine plantations.</P>
<P>For whose cause especially, I haue been drawne out of my good affection to them, to publish some reasons that might giue them content and satisfaction, and also stay and stop the wilfull and wittie cauiller: and herein I trust I shall not be blamed of any godly wise, though thorow my slender iudgement I should misse the marke, and not strike the naile on the head, considering it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the first attempt that hath beene made (that I know of) to defend those enterprises.

<P>But now the ordinarie examples and precepts of the Scriptures reasonably and rightly vnderstood and applied, must be the voice and word, that must call vs, presse vs, and direct vs in euery action.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Reas.</HI> 2.</NOTE>And first seeing we daily pray for the conuersion of the heathens, we must consider whether there be not some ordi|nary meanes, and course for vs to take to conuert them, or whether praier for them be only referred to Gods extraordi|narie worke from heauen. Now it seemeth vnto me that we ought also to endeuour and vse the meanes to conuert them, and the meanes cannot be vsed vnlesse we goe to them or they come to vs: to vs they cannot come, our land is full: to them we may goe, their land is emptie.</P>

As the ancient Patriarkes therefore remoued from straiter places into more roomthy, where the Land lay idle and waste, and none vsed it, though there dwelt inhabitants by them, as <HI>Gen.</HI> 13.6.11.12. and 34.21. and 41.20. so is it lawfull now to take a land which none vseth, and make vse of it.</P>

<P>Secondly, this composition is also more particular and applicatorie, as touching our selues there inhabiting: the Em|perour by aioynt consent, hath promised and appointed vs to liue at peace, where we will in all his dominions, taking what place we will, and as much land as we will, and bringing as many people as we will, and that for these two causes. First, because we are the seruants of <HI>Iames</HI> King of <HI>England,</HI> whose the land (as he confesseth) is, 2. because he hath found vs iust, honest, kinde and peaceable, and so loues our company, yea, and that in these things there is no dissimulation on his part, nor feare of breach (except our securitie ingender in them some vnthought of trecherie, or our vnciuilitie pro|uoke them to anger) is most plaine in other Relations, which shew that the things they did were more out of loue then out of feare.</P>
<P>It being then first a vast and emptie <HI>Chaos:</HI> Secondly ac|knowledged the right of our Soueraigne King: Thirdly, by a peaceable composition in part possessed of diuers of his lo|uing subiects, I see not who can doubt or call in question the lawfulnesse of inhabiting or dwelling there, but that it may be as lawfull for such as are not tied vpon some speciall occasion here, to line there as well as here, yea, and as the enterprise is weightie and difficult, so the honour is more worthy, to plant a rude wildernesse, to enlarge the honour and fame of our dread Soueraigne, but chiefly to displaie the

Neither of the little loue to the Gospell and profit which is made by the Preachers in most places, which might easily driue the zealous to the Heathens who no doubt if they had but a drop of that knowledge which here flieth about the streetes, would be filled with ex|ceeding great ioy and gladnesse, as that they would euen plucke the kingdome of heauen by violence, and take it as it were by force.</P>

<P>But can there be two neerer friends almost then <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Lot,</HI> or then <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas,</HI> and yet vpon as little oc|casions as we haue heere, they departed asunder, two of them being Patriarches of the Church of old; the other the Apo|stles of the Church which is new, and their couenants were such as it seemeth might binde as much as any couenant be|tweene men at this day, and yet to auoid greater inconue|niences they departed asunder.</P>
<P>Neither must men take so much thought for the flesh, as not

to be pleased except they can pamper <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> bodies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> varie|ty of dainties. Nature is content with little, and health is much endangered, by mixtures vpon the stomach: The de|lights of the palate doe often inflame the vitall parts: as the tongue setteth a fire the whole body.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iames</HI> 3.6.</NOTE> Secondly, varieties here are not common to all, but many good men are glad to snap as a crust. The rent taker liues on sweet morsels, but the rent payer eats a drie crust often with watery eies: and it is no|thing to say what some one of a hundreth hath, but what the bulke, body and cominalty hath, which I warrant you is short enough.</P>
<P>And they also which now liue so sweetly, hardly will their children attaine to that priuiledge, but some circumuentor or other will outstrip them, and make them sit in the dust, to which men are brought in one age, but cannot get out of it againe in 7. generations.</P>
<P>To conclude, without all partialitie, the present consump|tion which groweth vpon vs here, whilst the land groaneth vnder so many close fisted and vnmercifull men, being com|pared with the easinesse, plainenesse and plentifulnesse in li|uing in those remote places, may quickly perswade any man to a liking of this course, and to practise a remoual, which be|ing done by honest, godly and industrious men, they shall there be right hartily welcome, but for other of dissolute and prophane life, their roomes are better then their companies; for if here where the Gospell hath beene so long and plenti|fully taught, they are yet frequent in such vices as the Hea|then would shame to speake of, what will they be when there is lesse restraint in word and deed? My onely sute to all men is, that whether they liue there or here, they would learne to vse this world as they vsed it not, keeping faith and a good conscience, both with God and men, that when the day of account shall come, they may come forth as good and fruit|full seruants, and freely be receiued, and enter into the ioy of their master.</P>
