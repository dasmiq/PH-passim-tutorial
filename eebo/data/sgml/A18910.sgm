<P>_I Haue heere for thy

of the Sacred-writ,
vsually caled BIBLE,
from the greek word
that in English is, BOOKE: be|cause
it is the Book of al books;
with which Book, other books
compared, they are but blots
of mans braine, whereas this is
the Sacred-writ and wisedome
of ELOHIM, or, of that
ONE ESSENCE IN TRI|NITIE.
That Holy-booke,
before the Incarnation of the
PROMISED SEED, was divi|ded
into Lavve and Prophets:
<PB REF="4">
but since the CHRIST assu|med
our nature, &amp; in the same
ascended to the right hand of
Majestie, from whence HE sent
downe the HOLY-GHOST to
fill all thinges, especially the
hearts of his APOSTLES, for
speaking &amp; penning the minde
of IESVS: after that time (I say)
The Book of God was divided
into PROPHETS and APO|STLES,
Iesus Christ himselfe

<P>Betweene this <HI>Malachi</HI> and
the NEVVE TESTAMENT,
haue (too inconsideratlie) bene
inserted, certaine PRIVATE
writings, called <HI>Apocrypha:</HI> an
Humaine Breath, betwixt the
Lips of the two Testamentes.
<HI>Malachi</HI> (in English, Messenger
or Angel) (prophecieth plainly,
(Chap. 3. 1. and 4. 5.) that IE|HOVAH
will sende vnto the
Iewes a Messenger, even <HI>Elijah,</HI>
to prepare the way before the
<PB REF="5">
MESSENGER OF COVE|NANT,
viz. CHRIST. These
speaches of <HI>Malachi,</HI> (or last
ANGEL of the old Covenant)
are the very Face of the Newe
Testament or Covenant made
for Many. <HI>Matthew,</HI> he repor|teth
the ANGEL from Hea|uen,
Chapter 1. 20. bringing
newes of IESVS: and Chap. 2.
1. The Messenger of Covenant
is borne: and Chap. 3. IOHN
BAPTIST the PREPARER
of Christ his way, is introduced
in that worke. <HI>Mark</HI> begin|neth
with the same: and <HI>Luke</HI>
(Chap. 1.) bringeth in the AN|GEL
publishing the birth of
the Messenger appointed to
prepare the waye: as also pro|claiming
the birth of the AN|GEL
of the NEVVE COVE|NANT,
for whome he was to
prepare the waye, calling this
IOHN, ELIAS: because hee
<PB REF="5">
goeth before Christ in the SPI|RIT
and POVVER of ELI|AS,
or <HI>Eliiah.</HI> The Evangelist
<HI>Iohn</HI> in his 1. Chapter, bring|eth
in the saving LIGHT Ie|sus,
and the MAN SENT from
GOD, viz. <HI>Iohn.</HI> Thus the
last BREATH of the olde Te|stament
in <HI>Malachi,</HI> &amp; the first
BREATH of the Newe Testa|ment
in the mouthes of the E|VANGELISTS,
is all ONE
BREATH CANONICALL
from Heaven. They looke not
with <HI>Ianus,</HI> into two contra|ry
Coastes: but Hand in hand
they joyne, kissing each other,
and both of them looking in|to
the EAST, from whence
the Glorious DAY-STAR did
visit the Earth.</P>
<P>Who nowe dare hinder their
lips from meeting, by inserting
Vn-canonicall writs, a Darke-Cloude,
and Private (if not, a
<PB REF="6">
stinking) Breath. The Iews that
kept the Canon, received them
not: As also, they were not writ+ten
in <HI>Hebers</HI> sacred tongue: a
sufficient Brand, that they were
no Orackles from IEHOVAH

<P>Exercise thy selfe in pervsing
the Bible, the whole of al these
several writs, and thereby thou
shalt easilie (God his Spirite as|sisting
<PB REF="6">
thee) discerne the true
Christ from False, the True
Church from the False: True
writ from False: and so conse|quently,
all holy Trueth from
Falshood. And for helping thy
weake Memorie, as also, for gi|uing
a taste of that large Truth,
in short speach, I haue (throgh
God his helpe) manifested my
poore power, but riche good|will,
in this little booke. First,
I haue in English Po&euml;sie (drawn
according to an ancient <HI>staffe</HI>)
delivered summarily the hysto|rie
of the olde and newe Testa|ment:
Secondly, vpon the most
difficult points of the Po&euml;sie, I
haue dilated by way of Illustra|tion,
not only for the fulfilling
of the hystorie: but also for dis|cussing
sometimes, some neces|sarie
question: as also annexed
hereto, such certaine computa|tion
of time, for speciall joynts
<PB REF="7">
of the Story, as whereby the
spirituall minded, may some|thing
bee furthered to deeper
points contemplatiue. As thou
shalt receiue any good hereby,
so I pray thee be thankful vnto
God therfore, &amp; quickly thou
shalt finde his hand vpon thee
to every good work. The Lord
be with thy spirit Amen.</P>

Having Created that Hea|uenly and Earthly Matter. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">oe it was as a confused Chaos, or rude Lumpe, but over-covered by the Breath (or Spirit of EL) as egges covered by the Hen, for bringing soorth a more excellent Crea|ture: without which sitting vpon, as not only there woulde be no newe Creature, but also the egge wold in time cease to be that it first is so (and much more than so) without that over-spreading of the Spirit, that first Matter would haue returned into Nothing, and haue ceased Being. But brieflie, (for I professe brevitie in this Book) that Matter Crea|ted, all being darknes, ELOHIM calleth Light out of darknes, and separating them, hee calleth Darknes (for it first had Being) Night; and the Light, day, and so was Created the first daye. Into which day, most liklie may be referred the Crea|tion of Angels, wherevnto I am the rather led, be|cause they are tearmed by the holy Ghost, <HI>Angels of Light,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. Cor. 11. 14. and it may be, they had their Being from the Heavenly nature. But in which of<PB N="16" REF="9"> the Six daies soever they were Created, sure it is, that before Man his Creation, they had forsaken their Originall, <HI>Iob. 4. 18. Iude</HI> 6. compared with his time of tempting the Woman.</P>
<P>In the second day, was created the Firmament or superiour Region, calling it Heauen, putting a separation betwixt the superior &amp; inferior waters.</P>
<P>In the third day, ELOHIM first commanded the inferiour waters to gather into appointed pla|ces, calling them waters so collected, Seas: and the drye part, Earth. Secondly, hee commaundeth the same Earth to bring forth Hearbs and Trees.</P>
<P>In the fourth day, the Lord commaunded two great shining Starres to Exist in the firmament, ap|pointing the Greater (namely, the Sun) for the day: and the lesser (namely, the Moone) for the Night.</P>
<P>In the fift day, God commaunded divers Crea|tures to haue their Being out of the Waters: first, creeping water Creatures, as Eeles, Snakes, &amp;c. Secondly, he commaundeth Being to Whales and all Fishes: Thirdly, to all feathered Fowles: blessing all of them to multiplication.</P>
<P>In the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">xt day, hee commaundeth the Earth to bring forth every kind of Beast, pasing or creeping. As I vnderstand the Serpent (<HI>Genes.</HI> 3. 1.) in English <HI>Creeping,</HI> not to be a Creeper of the Waters, long|ing to the fift daies work; but of these Earth-cree|pers, because there he is called a Beast of the Feild: So, I marvell at some, who haue peremptorilie af|firmed, because ELOHIM there commaundeth him to go on his bellie, that he crept not before As <HI>M. Caluin</HI> thereon, might haue staied such resolute heades: so (in a case at least doubtfull) they should haue feared, lest they should haue rushed on <HI>Mo|ses:</HI> who in the fift day, giveth amongst watry Cre|atures, the Creepers first place: as in this sixt daies work, placeth the creeping Beast next immediatly<PB N="17" REF="9"> before Man: being in the same day, and in the place next before man Created: which done,</P>

The <HI>Minde</HI> conceiveth and vnderstandeth things: the <HI>Wil,</HI> affecteth the obiect, accordingly as the minde first conceiveth of the thing: and from this minde conceiving, and will af|fecting, there proceedeth a working power, or a power by which something is done.

And as them three Persons make but one God: so these three Faculties (for the Sou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e being a single Sub|stance it cannot be parted) do make but one spiri|tuall Essence, or Soule. But as the Father worketh not without his Sonne; nor the Holy Ghost with|out the Father and the Sonne: so neither doth the minde, or will, or working power, effect any thing sundred, but ioyntly: yet as wee attribute Creation to the Father: Redemption to the Sonne: Illumi|nation to the Spirit: So, to the Minde we attribute Vnderstanding, conceipt: to the Will, we attribute well or ill affecting: and to the working power, we attribute the thing wrought or done. As in that one God, no Person is before or after another in Time<PB N="18" REF="10"> but in Order of some externall work to vs wrought: So neither in that one Soule, is the minde before the will in Time, nor the working power behinde them in time (<HI>For the power of working is before the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">hing wrought</HI>) but onely in Order: for there is no sooner a Soule, but there exist all them three, and without any one of them the Soule cannot be. If one demaund, what is it that Createth all things? I answere, God. What is it that Redeemeth Man falne? God. What is it that enlightneth man? God: yet there are not three, but One God So demand what it is in mee that vnderstandeth? I answere, a Soul. What is that which willeth or affectionateth any thing? the Soule. What is it, whereby thou art enabled to liue, mooue? I answer, a Soule. yet are there not three, but one Soule in me, whereby them things are wrought. <HI>Philosophandi quia non institutum, Dixi.</HI> But as no Image can almost any whit attaine the pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">fection of that <HI>Thing,</HI> whereof it is an Image: so neither this Image of GOD in man, able to attaine the excellency of the <HI>Highest,</HI> who in every thing is Infinite, Onely, and the Cause of other things.</P>

<P>(b) As the Tribe of <HI>Levi,</HI> was chosen to service of the Tabernacle, so neither might they meddle therewith in their vnripe yeares: for boyes are vn|fit for holy Ministrie. At 25. yeares they entred in|to the Tabernacle for doing common, inferiour du|ties, as also to see and behold their Elder Brethren howe they slaughtered the Beastes, howe they cut them vp and disposed things. And shall wee admit foolish Boyes, or Foole-Elders into the Church, there to meddle with the worde, before they haue learned <HI>Orthoto-mein,</HI> To Cut, or Divide, <HI>The word aright.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, the Levites having spent some 5. years that way, then at 30. they begun to serue. At 50. yeares, the time of impotencie, they were not ex|alted into higher roomes; for there was no higher for them, but discharged of the former painefull place; for all this, Compare <HI>Nombers</HI> 4. 47. with <HI>Nomb.</HI> 8. 24. 25&punc; 26.</P>
<P>The Priests lippes were to preserue knowledge, and the People were to seeke the Lawe at his mouth, <HI>Malachi</HI> 2. 7. and herewithall, <HI>Moses</HI> char|ged <HI>Levi, Deut.</HI> 33. 8. 10. 1. The People bringing Beastes to the doore of the Tabernacle, that they might bee slaughtered for sinne, did thereby pro|fesse, the necessitie of the <HI>Death</HI> of the <HI>Promised Seede,</HI> for sinne: as also, 2. by putting their hand on the Beasts heade, they professed that themselues deserved the same death for Sinne. 3. And in as much as they brought the Beastes to be offered vp (not by their owne hand, but by the Priestes, they thereby professed, that it was not in their owne power to sacrifice for the least Sinne, but that it must be offered vp by him, that was figured out vn|der<PB N="56" REF="30"> that Priest-hood: namely, by Christ, who was both the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> and <HI>Sacrificer.</HI> 4. By the High|Priest, his once a yeare entring into the <HI>Holiest place,</HI> was more plainly typed foorth the <HI>Messiah,</HI> who <HI>Once</HI> should offer vp for altogither, <HI>Heb.</HI> 7. 27. a Sacrifice and oblation, that neither needed to be offered vp daily (as were the former) nor can|not be offered by any, but by him that is Priest (not according to <HI>Levi,</HI> on whome Rome holdeth her Priest-hood&punc; but) according to the order of <HI>Melchi|sedech:</HI> but of Christ himselfe that is testified, <HI>Heb,</HI> 7. 17. namely, that onely to HIM, that <HI>Everlasting</HI> Priest-hood was committed: a Priest-hoode that needeth no Successor as did <HI>Aarons</HI> (because they were ever dying) for this <HI>Priest</HI> continueth for ever with his One sufficient, perfect Sacrifice, <HI>Heb.</HI> 7. 22. 23. 24. 25. 26. 27.</P>
<P>That <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Wine</HI> therefore, left by Christ vnto his Church, hath beene improperlie called a <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> seeing they are but <HI>Signes</HI> of that Sacri|fice: Signes of that Body and Blood. Nor yet, Na|ked Signes, but Signes exhibitiue: sealing as verily Christ vnto the soules of the Faithfull, as they veri|lie receiue into their mouth, the Bread and wine. Their Mouth no more surely receiveth the Signes, then their Soule the <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ing signified.</HI></P>
<P>5. By the Peoples washings and Purifyings, they professed what puritie was required of such as bare the Name of IEHOVAHS <HI>Israel.</HI> 6 By the Priests Garments, as also other their pure observa|tions: they were taught howe Pure, Spotles, and without Sinne, the exspected Priest, Messiah shuld be. Neither might such, having fallen from IEHO|VAHS service to Idoles, minister before the Alter againe: but onely (after Repentance) were to bee exercised in common Leviticall duties, <HI>Ezech.</HI> 44. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">0. 11. 12. 13.

But their ig|norance in This, as in Other things deepely appea|reth, in labouring to make an open Dissimilitude, a Similitude.</P>
<P>1. Them Levites fell away from a ministeriall calling: but some of these Christians did fall but as Private men.</P>
<P>2. The Levites fell from open trueth, to open grosse Idolat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">, even to the <HI>Idols</HI> of the Gentiles<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> as for these Christians, they fell divers of them vp|on a doubting of the truth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e they fell vnto, be|ing likewise Professours of Christ, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> for the Name of Christ: whereas the Levites fall was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> inexcusable (and more too) as if a Christian should become a Iewe, or Turke.</P>
<P>3. The Levites falling, they served before the Idoles: so haue not many of these during their fall.</P>
<P>4. The Levits returning by Repentance, were not debarred all Ministeriall service: but they wold debarre the poore Christians, simplie for ever from all office Ministeriall.</P>
<P>5. If it may please them to ponder the Lord his <HI>Word</HI> better, before they publish their owne <HI>Word</HI> to the whole world, they shall finde (as I ob|served in the former Staffe) that all sortes of Levits, (though spotles) were not capable of Priest-hoode, and so, of standing before the Alter: As <HI>Gershom</HI> &amp; <HI>Aaron,</HI> their Familie was chosen to the Priestes worke: so this sort of Levites, could onely be saide to be debarred the Alter: as for the other, though they never fell, yet they might not medle with that peece of Service. If the Levites of the Families of <HI>Kohath</HI> and <HI>Merari</HI> so fel, they notwithstanding are not debarred their former place. Onely, One sorte<PB N="58" REF="31"> of Levites <HI>Beare that shame,</HI> of being debarred their former height of Calling: and they bee such, as in the former <HI>Height,</HI> did beare a liuely resemblance of <HI>Christ.</HI> For such as had made so fearfull a Fall, to haue beene restored or lifted vp into that place, that specially typed out <HI>Our spotles Priest</HI> IESVS; having bene so notablie spotted with open palpa|ble Idolatrie, would haue beene derogatorie vnto Christ figured. If a blemish in one of their bodies made him vncapable of Priesthood, then no mar|uell, if so grei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ie a fall, put him from that sacred <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">i|guring Seate.</P>
<P>Thus, where divers (whose names I willinglie conceale) haue thought that that Deposition was nothing Ceremonial, and therefore with too open sounde, did smite vp their drum, and display their Banner, they see the very ground of all their hope, cashierde, &amp; quasht with a wet Finger, <HI>Obiec.

Nay, this is worse than that of <HI>Novatianus,</HI> for he denied the dignitie of Christian to him, that before had fallen in a Christian place: but this Newe-learning denieth office to him, that never fell in office.</P>
<P>Wiselie fore-sawe the holy Ghost this soare, and therfore hath left a plaster accordingly in the Gos|pell, where hee propoundeth vnto vs Persons Re|bukeable, both before and after their Calling: yet neither it debarred the first from entrie, nor the se|cond from the continuance in their holy Church Function. <HI>Matthew</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> notablie rebukeable <HI>Before; Peter</HI> and <HI>Barnabas,</HI> notablie Rebukeable <HI>After</HI> their Calling. <HI>Mathew</HI> a Publicane: <HI>Paul</HI> an abhominable Bloodsucker. <HI>Peter</HI> first an Apostate, secondy, togither with <HI>Barnabas</HI> taken tardye with fowle dissembling. And if in any there shuld of ab|solute necessity haue bene conversation vnrebuke|able, it had bene highly necessary in the <HI>Maister Build<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rs.</HI></P>
<P>If any of absolute necessitie, should haue beene vnrebukeable as was Christ, then necessarily such should haue bene his <HI>Hands,</HI> for such were they in their work. Every one will cast their eye back vnto the Master workman, and think themselues happy if they can but attaine to bee so perfect: why then would Christ call into office, such as might after fal and scandalize the holy truth; had it not bin more credit to his cause, that such should first haue prea|ched, as might every way be vnrebukeable? would not people the sooner haue beleved, when they had seene the <HI>Faith of Christ</HI> so powerful in the Apostle, as hee never once fell after the preaching thereof?<PB N="60" REF="32"> Surely, surely, Brethren, as it woulde haue gone hard with a man that should come to his Deaths-bed vnrepentant: if Christ had not left one Presi|dent of graunting Remission of Sinne at the last houre: so, had we not sufficient Presidents, of Iesus his Calling men To, and continuing men IN the Church-office, (ey a more excellent office than a|ny of vs can beare) it would go hard with the poor Church. Except Angels came from Heauen, Itrow she would never be furnished with men. As the Priests were called to figure Christ spot|les, even as the spotles Lamb figured his Sacrifice: so there was required in them Persons, all outward shewe of Puritie. <HI>Dauid</HI> was a speciall figure of Christ the Warriour: <HI>Salomon,</HI> of Christ the Chur|ches Spouse: but they and their seede might enioy that Regall roome, notwithstanding they had ble|mishes in their Bodies, and though they weare vn|washen Garments, &amp;c. But for the Levites of <HI>Aa|rons</HI> Family, one blemish would put them by: and herein they fully represented our Sacrifice and Sa|crificer spotles; without which, there had bene no Redemption for sinne. If Church-Officers nowe shadowe Christ his Priesthood, as did the former, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">hen there were some likelyhood of this: namely, That Persous reprooueable for passed fact, were ever afterwards (notwithstanding Repentance) vt|terlie vncapable of entring into, and still retaining any Ecclesiasticall function. But I trowe, none are so grosse as to affirme, that the Newe Church, or Newe Testaments Church her Ministery, doth so fore-type, fore-figure, or shadowe the Priest ever|lasting, even Iesus, ordained by oath, a Priest fore|uer after the Order of <HI>Melchi-sedech:</HI> which if, I see not why any shuld any longer, retaine such an Ar|gument of Angellike ministery.</P>

The word importing Halfe, some vnderstand it of

teach, that Iesus his Baptisme begun the first year

the Newe Testaments Revelation, where it is

<P>(b) <HI>Iohn Baptist</HI> (the so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> of <HI>Zacha|riah</HI> the Priest, <HI>Luke,</HI> 1.) allyed by his Mothers side to blessed <HI>Marie,</HI> (for though the other Tribes might not marry one with another, for avoyding confusion of <HI>Lotted</HI> in|heritance: yet might <HI>Levi</HI> (who had no such inhe|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">itance, and therefore not like possibilitie of con|fusion) marrie with other Tribes. This <HI>Iohn</HI> begun to preach <HI>The Baptisme of Repentance for the remis|sion of Sinnes,</HI> in the 15. yeare of <HI>Tiberius, Romes Ce|sar, Pon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">us Pilate</HI> being then Governour in <HI>Iudea:</HI> but afterwards beheaded by <HI>Herod</HI> for reproving his vnlawfull marriage. This <HI>Iohn</HI> (having the Spirit of <HI>Elias</HI>) prepared the People vnto Iesus, by hewing squaring, and smothing their hearts, lest otherwise<PB N="132" REF="68"> Iesus should haue smit the Earth with cursing.</P>
<P>Vnto this <HI>Iohn</HI> came Iesus to be baptised. <HI>Iohn</HI> refusing as being fitter to be baptised by Iesus: our Saviour tels him it must be so, for fulfilling of righ|teousnes. <HI>Iohn</HI> baptizeth him in Iordan (through which <HI>Iesus</HI> or <HI>Ioshua</HI> safely led Israel) at what time the holy Ghost manifested himselfe vnder the bo|dilie shape of a <HI>Doue,</HI> lighting vpon Iesus: togither withall, a voice passed from Heaven: saying, <HI>Thou art my beloued Sonne, in thee I am well pleased.</HI> Here was the <HI>Father,</HI> the <HI>Sonne,</HI> and the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> con|curring in this Baptismes solemnization. The <HI>Sonne</HI> presents himselfe for fulfilling Righteousnes. The <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> sheweth <HI>Iesus</HI> to bee simple and inno|cent as a <HI>Doue:</HI> the <HI>Father</HI> proclaimes him, first his <HI>Beloved Sonne:</HI> Secondly, <HI>In whome hee rested well pleased.</HI> Thus was the <HI>Dore-sacrament</HI> of the newe Testament graced by ELOHIM, that <HI>Three-one.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> Why should Iesus be baptized with wa|ter, seeing he was sinles, and that Sacramentall wa|ter teacheth the baptized, first that sinne is put a|way by the blood of Iesus: secondly, that the bap|tized is to die to sinne, and to rise vnto a newe life.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Circumcision signified the like, yet was he circumcised, as he is here baptized. Yet I easilie graunt, nay, I do boldlie affirme, that hee was nei|ther circumcised nor baptized for the two forme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> ends: and yet of absolute necessitie, he was both to be circumcised and baptized, &amp; that for this cause: As Circumcision and baptisme were inioyned man because of sinne (seales of sinnes forgiuenesse by blood-shed, even by the blood of the Lambe slaine from the beginning of the world) so, howe should them Sacraments of the Olde and Newe Testa|ment haue bene holy and liuely to the receivers, if so the holy Lambe and Lord of life had not in our nature so sanctified them? Hee for giving Life vnto<PB N="133" REF="68"> both them, did therefore vndergoe both in his bo|die. Thereby, Circumcision was made <HI>Heauens-doore</HI> vnto the old Church <HI>Zion;</HI> and thereby was Baptisme made <HI>Heauens-entrye</HI> vnto the Newe Church, <HI>Ierusalem</HI> from aboue. So the Sacrament was not onely given, to <HI>Preach Life</HI> to the first <HI>A|dam:</HI> but also, <HI>To be made Life</HI> by the second <HI>Adam:</HI> even as was the whole Lawe, not only given to the olde Man&punc; but also to bee performed without blot by the newe Man, from Heaven heavenly.

<P><HI>Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">st.</HI> Was <HI>Iudas Iscariot</HI> present in both these Suppers?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> In the first hee was. Neither might any soule-maime debar any Circumcised from the old Supper: nor yet any Soul-soare vnseene in the bap|tized, debarre from the newe Supper. Seene and knowne pollutions in the bodies of the Circumci|sed, would debar them the holy Congregation and Supper: so, only seene and knowne sin vnrepented, can debarre such the newe Testaments Assemblie and their holy Supper.</P>
<P>To the question therefore I answer thus: Many learned and worthie deep reverence, haue written, that <HI>Iudas</HI> was present: but yet I see somthing that keeps me from so thinking. But first let it be gran|ted, that <HI>Iudas</HI> was there a Communicant, what then? you wil (it may be) with others conclude, <HI>Then may wicked ones</HI> be admitted to the Lords Supper; I answer, it prooveth not, that <HI>Knowne wicked</HI> may bee admitted: for <HI>Iudas</HI> was not an open wicked one, but a secret wicked one, and therefore vnder God his Iudgment, that knowes the heart, and not vnder mans censure, who knowes not the heart.</P>
<P><HI>Obiect.</HI> The man Christ knewe him for a Tray|tour, and yet would not debarre him.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="70">First, the Man Christ knewe him not alreadie a Traytor, for as yet he had not betrayed Iesus: and Man must censure <HI>Actions,</HI> or things that bee <HI>Pa|tent,</HI> not <HI>Latent.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Christ as he was man knewe not that hee had such a trayterly thought in his heart, no more then as he was the sonne of man hee knewe the latter day: for every meane wit knoweth, that Thoughtes of men, and personall Future Actions, were communicated vnto his Man-hoode by the God-head, or his divine nature. If <HI>Iudas</HI> then had beene present, hee was to Man there, considered as man, an hypocrite or vnseene Traytor: and there|fore nothing maketh, for admission of vnrepentant knowne wicked, to the Lords Table.</P>
<P>But as before I saide, I rather think he was not there, for this cause: Blessed <HI>Iohn</HI> in his 13. Chap. 30. Verse, saith: <HI>As soone as he</HI> (namely, IVDAS) <HI>had received the soppe, he went immediatly out.</HI> Now, the <HI>Soppe</HI> was no part of this <HI>Newe Supper,</HI> but ap|pertaining to the old Testaments Supper: if there|fore <HI>Iscariot</HI> went out from them, <HI>Immediatly</HI> vpon the receipt of the <HI>Soppe,</HI> (and so saith <HI>Iohn</HI>) then went he out to go vnto the high Priests, before the Institution of the Newe Supper: and this let the godlie hearted consider.</P>

<P>(c) As <HI>Marie</HI> had much forgiven, so shee-loved much. Her loue partly appeared, in this her earlie repaire to the Sepulcher. Before her comming, an Angel from Heaven had rowled the sealed stone a|side, Iesus was risen, and the hyred watchmen were gone to the Rulers; who bribed the Soldiers, to the end they should say, that Iesus his Disciples had in the night stole away the body. Shee comming to the Sepulcher (as did <HI>Salome</HI> and another <HI>Marie</HI>) the Angel informes them of his Resurrection, com|manding them to returne, and tell the same to <HI>Pe|ter</HI> and the other disciples.

<P>Fourthly, he appeared to <HI>Cleopas,</HI> and the other Disciple, as they were going to <HI>Emmaus,</HI> 60. Fur|longs from <HI>Ierusalem, Luke</HI> 24. 13. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Fiftly, hee appeared to the Eleven (the greater number bearing name of the whole) at night being assembled to holy exercise, <HI>Luke</HI> 24. who brething on them, said: <HI>Recciue the holy Ghost: Whosoeuers sins ye remit, they are remitted vnto them: and whose sins soeuer yee retaine, they are retained.</HI> At this time, <HI>Thomas Didymus</HI> was wanting. No blessing got by absence from holy Assemblie. Thus our Lord spent the whol day in <HI>Apparitions</HI> and <HI>Doctrine.</HI> No mar|uell then, if the eleven gathered togither the eight day after, or next Lords day.</P>
<P>Sixtly, hee appeared the 8. day after, vnto the Eleuen. <HI>Didimus</HI> was then present, and therfore he schooleth him. And this was the second time of his appearance vnto the Apostles convened.</P>
<P>Seventhly, he was seene of more than 500. bre|thren at once, 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 15. 6.</P>
<P>Eightly, he was seene of <HI>Iames</HI> alone. 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 15. 7.</P>

<P><HI>Answ.</HI> No, the Lot remaineth in holy vse for a|voiding contention, <HI>Prov</HI> 18. 18.

<P>For the Elders, there is all the question.

<P>Hereabouts, many haue written great Volums, and multitudes knowe, that I haue written not a litle, let it then here suffice, that the <HI>Patterne Chur|ches</HI> had <HI>In</HI> them and <HI>To</HI> them, two sortes of El|ders or Over-seers: the former sort was speciallie<PB N="156" REF="80"> (thogh not only) exercised in <HI>Doctrine</HI> and <HI>Exhor|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ation,</HI> Rom 7. 8. called <HI>Pastors</HI> and <HI>Doctors,</HI> Ephes. 4 11.

This watching is, in cast|ing (not a curious eve, but) an eye of loue, (as first to our owne waies, so after) to the footesteps of our fellowe members: that if there be any slip or hal|ting, wee may help that member, in making more right steps.

<P>The Rule is this, if the fact be private, admonish that fellow member privatlie as thou maist winne him, not loose him: If he heare thee, that is, <HI>If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ee repent,</HI> Luke 17. 3. there is an end. If he repent not, thou art to take <HI>One</HI> or <HI>Two</HI> with thee (no delight should be in publishing a brothers sinne, no, not within the Church) these are to witnesse thy maner of dealing with him, as also his carriage towardes thee. If hee nowe repent, an end: if not, thou must bring it before the Church, not publish it in <HI>Gath,</HI> or amongst the Vncircumcised, I meane, to these that are not of the Church, for that is not only the way to destroy the cred<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">te of a brother, but also to make vile the holy profession: If hee heare not the Church, or mysticall body, whereof hee is a mem|ber, and whereof Christ is Heade, accompt him as an Heathen: that is, barre him the spirituall Tem|ple, and accompt of him, as of a Publicane, that is,<PB N="158" REF="81"> do not eate or drink with him, as the Iewes would
not with Publicanes.</P>
<P>This course of proceeding (even to the very ca|sting

member, and to bring home the wandring sheep.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> If the Sinner denye the private sinne to
mee, or if not to mee dealing alone; vet hee doeth
before my witnesses deny his sinne, what am I now
to do? must I there stay, lest I trouble the Church
with that wherof I haue no witnes, or must I go on.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> If the sinne be pregnant and plaine, (as

go on by the rule without stop, till he stop his sinne.
The denyall of the sinne, maketh the man so much
more monstrous, and vnto thee he should remaine

but to thee an open wicked one.</P>
<P><HI>Obiect.</HI> But if (I proceeding) he shou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d likewise
confidently deny the sinne before the Church, and
the sinne should rest vnconvicted, then I should be
censured for a slaunderer.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> If the danger of such issue, should hinder
thee from proceeding, then likewise the feare of
such issue, should ever keepe thee from admonish|ing
any <HI>One,</HI> so much as in priuate: for thou admo|nishing
privatlie, he might likewise impudently de|ny
it: or hee might reply thus, <HI>Though I haue done
this sinne, yet I will deny it to all men: and except
thou wilt ask me forgiuenes for thus reproouing me,

that there is no stoppage with the vnrepentant. Se|condly,<PB N="159" REF="81">
it cannot fall out, that such Sin shall not be

that Temple was a figure not onely of the whole

conclude, that Christ the heade, will not haue his

the honour of his own name. If <HI>Faith</HI> in Gods pro|mise,

<P><HI>Obiect.</HI> But some Sin is in it owne nature publike,
as Incest, Adulterie, Murder, &amp;c and therefore not
to be satisfied for by private Repentance.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> If a woman within the Church bring forth
a Child besides the order of continencie, her sin is
indeed publik, and therfore the vncleane man and
woman both (if both be within the Church) must
satisfie by publick Repentance.</P>

friend, should secretly entice vnto Idolatrie, that
friende (notwithstanding the sinne was secreet)<PB N="160" REF="82">
was not to bee concealed: therefore some secreet
sinnes are not at all to be concealed.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> You might rather conclude, <HI>Therefore
some secret sinne was once not to be concealed. Mo|ses</HI>
must end where Christ begins. <HI>Moses</HI> enioyned
<HI>That</HI> then: Christ eniovneth <HI>This</HI> nowe.</P>
<P><HI>Obiect.</HI> Such grosse sinnes cannot bee satisfied
for by publike Repentance, for the death of their
bodies is due.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Thogh the body deserue death, yet pub|like
Repentance satisfieth the Church. The Ince|stuous
person being humbled in his flesh, that is, in
the vnregenerate part: the Church of <HI>Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">inth&punc;</HI> was

<P>As all these Epistles tend to the advancing and
confirmation of the christian faith: so, for this time,
I will propound some speciall heades of Doctrine,
wherein one Epistle is more copious than another,
or at least, first in order according to the vsuall pla|ces
of the Epistles.</P>
<P>In the Epistle to the <HI>Romanes,</HI> I obserue: First,
the Apostles concluding all (Iewe and Gentile) vn|der
sinne, taking away all merit by workes: there|withall
delineating or plainly picturing foorth the
difference betwixt the <HI>Carnall</HI> and <HI>Spirituall</HI> per|son.
Secondly, I obserue his plaine proving of <HI>Isra|els</HI>
generall calling and obedience to the Christian
Faith, what time the <HI>Fulnes of the Gentiles be come
in.</HI> Hereof see, 1. part, at <HI>Iuda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s Ozias.</HI> Thirdly, the
doctrine of obedience to Princes and Magistrates,
not so much for feare of the sworde, as for consci|ence
sake. Fourthly, I note the doctrine he delivers
for supporting the weake brethren.</P>
<P>In the first Epistle to the <HI>Corinths,</HI> I obserue spe|ciallie;
First, the <HI>Methode</HI> of truly preaching Christ.
Secondly, the danger by having any communion
with an open leavened, or vnrepentant brother: to|gither
with the carriage due towards such. Thirdly,
I note the power is given to the Saintes for iudging
their owne causes civill. Fourthly, the Apostle put|teth
an end to questions touching single life, touch|ing
such married Couples, as whereof one was an
vnbeleever; touching the dutie of such as were cal|led
to the Christian faith, in such or such Vocation.
Fiftly, I note his doctrine concerning the vse of
meates sacrificed first to Idoles. Sixty, the true vse
of spirituall guiftes. Seaventhly, the absolute neces|sitie
of <HI>Loue</HI> (or <HI>Charity</HI>) in a Christian. Eightly, the<PB N="164" REF="84">
description of the <HI>Schoole of Prophecie.</HI> Chap. 14.</P>
<P>Vnto this holy exercise of <HI>Prophecie,</HI> hee stirreth
vp every particular man (for women <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ere</HI> may not
speake) as to labour after every spirituall guift, so
specially after Prophecie. Every man that hath a
publick profiting guift, in this exercise it is to bee v|sed,
but every thing in order.</P>
<P>The brother that is able onely, or specially, to
teach in a strange tongue, hee in this holy Congre|gation
is to speak, providing that there be another
to interpret his speach to the Auditorie: This no|tablie
overthwa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">teth such as will not heare a bro|ther
Prophet, thogh he speak no strange language.</P>
<P>They that Prophecie, that is, which divide the
word and apply it to the soule (<HI>Verse</HI> 24. 25.) are at
the most to be but three, (for one season of Assem|blie)
every one orderly teaching after another: the
Iudgement of whose doctrine and discreet Appli|cation,
appertaineth in the first place to the other
Prophets. The principall of this holy Schoole, I be|leeue
to be the <HI>Doctor,</HI> even as is the <HI>Pastor</HI> over o|ther
peculiar exercises.</P>
<P>Fiue peculiar <HI>Graces</HI> or <HI>Guifts</HI> are in this School,
to be vsed for aedification. 1. The guift of a Psalme.
2. of Doctrine 3. of Tongues. 4. of Revelation.
5. of Interpretation, All (saving that of Revelation)
is granted generally: yet simply neither can all Re|velation
be debarred: for at sometime may bee re|vealed
(and that vnto the meanest member) that
the whole Congregation hath in former time bene
carried away into some error. If any one such thing
(or any speciall point not revealed to the former
speaking Prophet) be vnto another revealed (<HI>Vers.</HI>
30.) he is orderly to be heard.</P>
<P>But because that of a <HI>Psalme</HI> is easilie graunted
of all, I would gladly demand, <HI>What is it for a man
there to haue a Psalme&punc;</HI> Heere a number lay their<PB N="165" REF="84">
hand on their mouth, or else they foolishlie answer,
<HI>It is the singing of som<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Psalme in the Bible:</HI> or else,
<HI>It is to pen a Psalme, and afterwards to sing it.</HI> Alas,
alas&punc; no: neither the one nor the other. The Apostle
commendeth to the Church <HI>Spirituall guifts, pecu|liar
guifts of the Spirit of Iesus,</HI> not fearing in the
first place to prefix the guift of a Psalme, as no
common guift, but at least as vneasie to be attained
as that <HI>of Doctrine, of Tongues, Interpretation, &amp;c.</HI>
Howsoever other Churches, yet <HI>Corinth</HI> (the Apo|stle
testifieth) was destitute of no guift, Chap. 1. 7.
No marvel then, if this guift be rather commended
to vse amongst them. As onely to pen a Sermon,
and then to reade it, cannot properly be called the
<HI>Guift of Preaching or Prophecying:</HI> so neither can
the singing of a penned Psalme, be truly called, <HI>The
guift of a Psalme:</HI> I therefore conclude; even as <HI>Do|ctrine</HI>
and <HI>Exhortation,</HI> is by the immediate instinct
of the Spirite, so is this <HI>Psalme</HI> vttered or soong.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> Who ever heard of any man, that could
so sing the praises of God and his wonderful works&punc;
that could deliver his holy meaning in <HI>Number</HI> &amp;
<HI>Measure.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> I praise God for it, I haue heard of the
guift, and heard the brother that hath bene so ex|ercised
in the midst of a Christian Congregation.
And lest he should sing but something he had co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d
by heart, the brethren thus tryed him. First, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
two brethren had taught from two severall Scrip|tures,
(onely fore<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> knowne to the speakers them|selues)
he was appointed to ground his <HI>Psalme,</HI> vp|on
that doctrine they first had delivered. He did so
presently, enlarging the doctrine and vse thereof:
and that without vnseemly pawse. Secondly (which
was the next time of Prophecie) he was placed in
the face of the holy Assemblie, and vnto him was
read a certaine Text (agreed vpon by the Church,<PB N="166" REF="85">
but at that instant) and therevpon, without more
adoe, he vttered a <HI>Psalme.</HI> After that, he was again
<HI>Proued,</HI> and so of the Brethren <HI>Approued.</HI> I my self
was an eate and eye-witnes of all this. So much of
the 8. Observation.</P>
<P>Nynthly, <HI>Paul</HI> confuteth the deniers of the bo|dies
resurrection (as for the supporting of the weak,
I observed it to the <HI>Romanes</HI>) And lastly, hee com|mandeth
laying aside somewhat for the helping of
the poor, appointing thereto the Lords day, or first
day of the weeke.</P>
<P>In his second to the <HI>Corinths,</HI> I mark specially, 1.
His care of having the <HI>Humbled</HI> sinner comforted.
2. His care to haue one Church to contribute to
anothers necessities. 3. His care of suppressing the
insolent contemners of his letters &amp; reprehensions.</P>
<P>In his Epistle to the <HI>Galatians,</HI> specially I note,
1. The curse of all false Doctrine and Gospels, al|thogh
published by an Angel from heaven. 2. That
<HI>Moses</HI> yoke of bondage, is not to bee ioyned with
<HI>Iesus</HI> his Gospell: the former longing to the sons of
<HI>Hagar</HI> the bond-woman, for whipping them vnto
Christ: the latter longing to the sons of <HI>Sarah,</HI> the
Free-woman, whose Children are of a newe Citie,
even of <HI>Ierusalem</HI> from aboue.</P>
<P>In his Epistle to the <HI>Ephesians,</HI> First, I beholde E|lection
to be before (not only our b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rth, but also be|fore)
the foundation of the World: and that Electi|on
to be in Christ Iesus onely: which Election be|fore
time, maketh it selfe knowne to vs in time, by
the sanctification of the holy Spirit. 2. I cast mine
eye to the immediate end of Christ his Ascension,
which, as touching his Church, was this: vz. <HI>To fill
all things, by giuing gifts vnto men:</HI> the end of them
guifts being twofold: First, for converting People,
and bringing them into holy constitution: Second|ly,
for edifying or building them more and more vp<PB N="167" REF="85">
in their newe-byrth, after they be once constituted
in orderly communion. Vnto this two-fold end, he
appointeth two sorts of Teachers: First, <HI>Apostles, E|uangelists,
Prophets,</HI> for the planting Churches: Se|condly,
<HI>Pastors</HI> and <HI>Teachers</HI> to the Churches once
planted: whereof see more in the next Staffe but
two following, in number the 17.</P>
<P>Thirdly, in this Epistle, I obserue his care of en|forming
Husbands and wiues, Parents &amp; children,
Masters and servants, in their mutuall duties.</P>
<P>In his Epistle to the <HI>Philippians,</HI> specially I pick
out: First, that it is a matter of reioycement, that
Christ bee preached, though some preach of envie,
and with affections impure. 2. That Bandes or im|prisonement
maketh the Gospell more glorious.
3 That the imprisoned Saintes (specially Ministers
of the word, &amp; more speciallie <HI>Kopiontes</HI> they that
haue traveled Churches planting, and delivering
Canonicall ordinances, are to bee provided for of
their Churches.</P>
<P>In his Epistle to the <HI>Colossians,</HI> (besides former
mentioned doctrines) I note, that such <HI>Religion</HI> as
is not in the writings of the Prophets and Apostles
<HI>Seene,</HI> but rather forbidden in the new Testaments
Canon, (as, worshipping of Angels, Touch not, tast
not, handle not, &amp;c.) is but a <HI>Wil-worship,</HI> carying
onely a shew of wisdome, and herein my Brethren
faile, that wold tie men to such Legal observances.</P>
<P>In his first to the <HI>Thessalonians,</HI> specially I take
heede: First, to the <HI>Thessalonians,</HI> true hearing and
receiving the Apostles wordes; who heard and re|ceived
that word, not as the worde of men, but as
the word of God. 2. That to mourne much for the
Saintes departed, is Gentile-like. 3. That Iesus his
comming to Iudgement, will be very sodaine, and
therefore needfull, that the Saintes be watchfull.</P>
<P>In his second to the <HI>Thessalonians,</HI> onely I nowe<PB N="168" REF="86">
obserue: That there was a general Apostacie from
the Christian faith, plainely foretolde. Which <HI>De|parture</HI>
should fall out by reason <HI>The Man of Sin,</HI>
the <HI>Antik<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">imenos,</HI> or <HI>Layer of a contrary Founda|tion,</HI>
should arise in the Church (through Chur|ches
not watching,) and so cause the Churches
for to vndergo his <HI>Spirituall Badge.</HI> Which Beast
(notwithstanding) in time should bee destroyed,
by the bright powerfull appearance of the Go|spell:
he in the meane time prevailing onely over
such, as had not received the loue of the truth, and
therefore iustly giuen over to beleeue lies, that so
they may be damned.</P>
<P>In his 1 Epistle to <HI>Timothie,</HI> I specially take vp:
First, <HI>Supplications, Prayers, Intercessions, Thankes|giuings</HI>
are to be made for all sortes of People. Se|condly,
howe <HI>Church-Overseers,</HI> and <HI>Seruitours</HI> are
to be qualified. Thirdly, that the Church<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ministers
at home (that is, in their owne Assemblie) is to be
provided for. Hee that provideth for his Oxe, and
with-holdeth necessaries from him that watcheth
over his soule, is no better than an Oxe, and vnwor|thie
the Gospell: yet Teachers must measure the
weak, and loose bodily right, if thereby they haue
hope to winne vnto Christ. Fourthly, that one ma|ner
of Rebuke appertaineth not to all the Saintes:
nor yet to receiue an Accusation against an Elder
so easilie, as against others.</P>
<P>In his 2&punc; to <HI>Timothie,</HI> First, an encouragement
for <HI>Timothie</HI> against al adversitie. 2. A plaine prog|nosticating
of our covetous sals Prophets, who sell
themselues &amp; their people to the devill for money.</P>
<P>In his Epistle to <HI>Titus,</HI> I only pick out the end of
the Evangelist <HI>Titus</HI> his abode in the litle Iland <HI>Cre|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI>
viz. to plant Churches, and in every Church her
Elders. In his Epistle to <HI>Philemon,</HI> the Apostle sen|deth
<HI>Onesimus</HI> back to his Maister <HI>Philemon,</HI> who<PB N="169" REF="86">
before had run away from his Master, therewithall
robbing <HI>Philemon</HI> of somewhat. The fellowe com|ming
to <HI>Paul</HI> at <HI>Rome</HI> (by some secreet draught of
the Spirit) <HI>Paul</HI> there begets him to the faith, &amp; so
returning him with this Epistle, he laboreth to qua|lifie
good <HI>Philemon. Thus endeth</HI> Paul <HI>his Epistles.</HI></P>

and therefore flat pride for any man to say, <HI>It was</HI>
Pauls, <HI>It was</HI> Marks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The chiefest point the ho|ly
Ghost there laboreth for, is: the removall of <HI>Mo|ses,</HI>
whose <HI>Letter</HI> was vnto the <HI>Hebrewes</HI> as a <HI>Vaile,</HI>
hindering them from seeing vnto the end of the
things abolished by Iesus anoynted our <HI>King, Priest</HI>
and <HI>Prophet</HI> 2. He denounceth fearefull Iudgment
against such as fell from Christian communion and
fellowship. 3. Hee stirreth them vp to Hospitalitie,
specially for receiving of Strangers.</P>
<P><HI>Iames</HI> his Epistle must needs be written before
any of <HI>Pauls,</HI> consideritg he died, <HI>Acts</HI> 12. Besides
my obserues in the former Epistles, I note speci|allie
in him: First, that <HI>Prayer</HI> must bee offered vp
without wavering. 2. That the <HI>Word</HI> must not on|l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
be heard, but also done. 3. That the Christian
Faith is not to be held in respect of Persons; be they
many, be they fewe; be they noble, be they igno|ble;
seeme they learned, seeme they vnlearned.
4. That a Person with gold-fingers is not therefore
to be seated vpmost at our Table. 5. That <HI>Faith<PB N="170" REF="87">
without Workes,</HI> is but the Devils faith. 6. That
Elders ar to visit the sick; and if the sick haue some
sinne troubling their conscience, they are with loue
to take notice thereof, and fervently therefore cal
vpon God by Prayer, for that sins remission. These
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lders must not want the spirite of Prayer. They
must therein bee driven from reading on a booke.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. That it is a most blessed work to convert a siner.</P>
<P>In <HI>Peters</HI> first Epistle I note: First, that a Chri|stian
must beware he suffer as a Righteous, not as
an vnrighteous doer. 2. That the Church Elders
are to feede their flock without constraint, not car|rying
themselues like Lords over God his heritage.</P>
<P>In his second Epistle, specially I excerpe: First,
that true Believers are made partakers of the <HI>Na|ture
divine.</HI> 2. That open Atheists (mocking at
the dissolution of all things b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> fire from Heaven)
shall arise in the last dayes. 3. That <HI>Pauls</HI> Epistles
contain some things hard to be vnderstood, which
the vnlearned should pervert.</P>
<P>In <HI>Iohn</HI> his first Epistle: First, that many <HI>Anti|christes</HI>
were gone out in his time. 2. That such as
are once borne of God, no more doe sinne: that is,
letteth not sinne <HI>Rule</HI> (howsoever <HI>Dwell</HI>) in their
mortall members. 3. That the <HI>One</HI> God, is distin|guished
into the <HI>Father,</HI> the <HI>Word,</HI> and the <HI>Holie
Ghost.</HI> 4. That there is a certaine sinne not to bee
prayed for.</P>
<P>In his second Epistle: I note, that to him (that
bringeth doctrine contrary to godlines) we are not
to say so much as <HI>God speed,</HI> much lesse receiue him
to house.</P>
<P>In his third Epistle: First, that it is worthy praise,
to entertaine brethren, and assist them in their voy|ages.
2. That it is no newe thing to be cumbred
with pratling busie bodies, who will neither further
Christs worke themselues, nor willinglie suffer such
as would.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="87">In <HI>Iude</HI> his Epistle, over and besides I obserue:
First, that the wicked are but as menstruous cloths
in our Feastes of Loue. 2. Lastly, that the man <HI>Ie|sus</HI>
our Saviour is God, and he onely able to keepe
vs from falling away, as also to present vs faultlesse
before the Father.</P>
<P>Nowe followeth a litle to be said of the Book<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
of Revelation.</P>
<P>Blessed <HI>Iohn</HI> (beloved of <HI>Iesus</HI>) being banished
into the Ile <HI>Patmos,</HI> and that by all probabilitie by
<HI>Domitianus</HI> (who succeeded <HI>Nero</HI>) There, on the
Lords day, <HI>Iohn</HI> was deeply ravished in the Spirite,
during which time, blessed <HI>Iesus</HI> commendeth vn|to
him the state of his Church vntill the last. First,
he enioyneth <HI>Iohn</HI> to write vnto the 7. <HI>Churches</HI> of
<HI>Asia the lesse.</HI> Secondly&punc; to set down in writing such
visions and their adiuncts, as might continue for the
Faithfuls vse for ever. And indeede, this Booke so
pictureth out the <HI>False Churches,</HI> (whether Idola|trous
Christian, or Mahumetane) as I cannot mar|uell,
though Satan hath almost driven this Booke
out of vse. The olde Church <HI>Zion,</HI> had her golden
prophecies for future events: and this was left to
the Newe Testaments Church, as a Loue-letter of
<HI>Iesus,</HI> whereby she should discerne Times, Persons,
Thinges. But marke this, that the <HI>Iewe</HI> is never
brought in within this book, as an Adversary. Their
number is sealed, <HI>Cap.</HI> 7. The same number of <HI>Them</HI>

<P>That <HI>Prophet</HI> (distinguished there from the resi|due) I hold of absolute necessitie, to be meant pro|perly of such as God stirreth vp (not to fore-tell of things, like <HI>Agabus,</HI> but) to gather People vnto the Faith, and to constitute Churches.</P>

<P>Secondly, the title <HI>Prophet</HI> (seeing they are not properly Apostles, who had their Calling immedi|atly from Christ: nor Evangelists, who had their Calling immediatly from the Apostles: nor Pastors nor Doctors, who haue their <HI>Nomination</HI> and <HI>Or|dination</HI> immediatly from a People already a true visible Church) seeing (I say) they are not properly such, but plainly distinguished from such (and other preaching ministeries besides these 5. there be not in the Newe Testament) it necessarilie therefore followeth, that such <HI>Worke-men</HI> are properly <HI>Pro|phets.</HI></P>

<P>When the Prodigal Gentile was received home to eat of the fat Bullock, and well liking Sacrifice <HI>Iesus,</HI> the Iewe stubbornly stood without the spi|rituall Tent, refusing to come in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">y, they haue re|fused hitherto to come into the spirituall banquet, and to communicate with vs. But the <HI>Fulnesse</HI> of<PB N="182" REF="93"> the Gentiles once accomplished, then shall <HI>Israel</HI> be called to the Faith of Christ Iesus: who percei|uing that <HI>Messiah</HI> was slaine before by them; they shall wayle Familie by Familie, with a great La|mentation, <HI>Zech.</HI> 12. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14.

Their Fall brought a blessing to the Gentiles, but their Rising shall bring much glory to such, as will walke in their light <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. 12. 15.</P>
<P>This their Rising, the Apostles were not igno|rant of, who (the last time that ever they asked a question of Iesus) did demaunde, <HI>If so hee would at that time Restore the Kingdome to Israel,</HI> ACT. 1. I well knowe that some (otherwise godly and lear|ned) haue blamed the Apostles there, for exspe|cting a worldly Kingdome: but (<HI>Tantorum pace</HI>) I dare not thinke that the Apostles are blame-wor|thie: nay, I deeme them praise-worthie, who had so speciall care for their owne peoples good.</P>
<P>First, If they dreamed that <HI>Israel</HI> should haue restored to them a Kingdome not onely spirituall, such a dreame cannot be infringed: nay, reade the Prophets attentiuely, and they insinuate a King|dome not onely spirituall.</P>
<P>Secondly, they saying <HI>Wilt thou at this time Re|store the Kingdome to, Israel,</HI> what answer doth <HI>Iesus</HI> returne? doth he reproue them? No: what saith he? Thus he answers, <HI>It is not for you to know the times or seasons, which the father hath put in his own power.</HI> Hee is so farre from denying the Kingdome they dreamed of, as he doth plainly graunt it. He grants it by answering only to the <HI>Tyme,</HI> wherein they ex|spected such <HI>Restauration:</HI> as though hee should say, <HI>You are greedy of vnderstanding, WHEN the Kingdome I shall be restored: the Time thereof is in the Fathers hand, neither is it necessarie for you to know:<PB N="183" REF="93"> looke you to your own present busines, &amp;c.</HI> This I take to be open &amp; plain ynough: specially, if we remem|ber that in the next place before, <HI>Hee had taught them the things that concerned his kingdome,</HI> imme|diatly wherevpon, they demaunde onely the <HI>Tyme</HI> of <HI>Israels Restauration,</HI> and onely hee answereth to the <HI>Tyme,</HI> as graunting their meaning of the King|dome. If they had now erred in Iudgement, I can|not think, but hee would not haue ascended before he had reformed it: considering the holy Ghost af|terwardes was not sent downe, so much to teache them any <HI>Newe thing,</HI> as to bring vnto their re|membrance <HI>The things he had before taught.</HI></P>
<P>First, God dwelled in <HI>Shems</HI> Tent, even in the middest of <HI>Israels</HI> People, and such Gentiles were blessed, as had recourse vnto them.</P>
<P>Secondly, God hath inhabited amidst the Gentiles, and such Iewes haue bene happy as haue had recourse to them.</P>
<P>Thirdly, God will againe dwel amidst the Iews; and blessed shall such Gentiles be, as gather them|selues vnto them. Thus the Lord concludeth both vnder Sinne, that on both hee may haue mercy: and that neither may swell in any thing of their owne; he hath shut vp all in vnbeliefe, that so hee may haue mercie vpon all: The first shall be last, and the last shall bee first.

<HEAD>A PREFACE TO
Prayer, by way of
Dialogue.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Qu.</HI> _HAue you penned the
subsequent <HI>Forme</HI> of
praier, to the end that
any other shuld think
they had well prayed,
in having read or said the same over?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> No: Saying over wordes is no
more <HI>Praying,</HI> than reading over wordes
is <HI>Preaching.</HI> As the <HI>Guift</HI> of Preaching is
an immediate vtterance of the Lord his
will conceived in the heart by the spirite
of Iesus: so is the <HI>Guift</HI> of Prayer an im|mediat
vtterance (<HI>Vocall</HI> or <HI>Mentall</HI>) of
things presently conceived in the heart,
by the Spirit of Iesus. For this cause doth
<HI>Paul</HI> tell the <HI>Galatians</HI> 4. 6. that whome
God adopteth in Christ, to them he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> gi|ueth
the sprit of Christ: even to this end,
that he may stirre vp the <HI>Heart</HI> of the a|dopted
to crye, <HI>Abba,</HI> Father: that is, <HI>To
call vehemently vpon God, as vpon a merci|full
Father, not a Tyrant or Iudge.</HI> And be|cause
none can truly pray, that haue not
this Spirite, as also, because no Requests
<PB N="190" REF="97">
(<HI>Vocall</HI> or <HI>Mentall</HI>) is true Prayer, that is
not conceived and suggested by the spi|rit

plainly (putting himselfe in the number)
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">aith, <HI>Wee knovve not hovve to Pray as vve
ought, but the Spirite it selfe maketh request
for vs:</HI> that is, <HI>The Spirit of Iesvvs putteth in|to
the mouth of our spirite vvhat to praye.</HI>
To prescribe therefore and enjoyne <HI>Set|vvordes,</HI>
is to strip the Spirit of his office,
and the way to quench our Spirit.</P>
<P><HI>Obiect.</HI> Every one hath not knovvledge
to pray, therfore set formes do help such.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> True: and so doe the written set
Scriptures help such: but yet it followeth
not, that that is praier it selfe: The helpe
to Praier &amp; Preaching, is not our Prayer
and preaching it selfe: the first is a <HI>Cause,</HI>
the second the <HI>Effect:</HI> no Cause and his
Effect are the same: every halfe-pennie
Sophister knowes that. Secondly, where
you say, <HI>Euery one hath not knowledge to
pray,</HI> thereto I answer: every one that is
adopted (as afore) hath the spirit of Ie|sus:
every one that hath that spirit, hath a
speaking (not a dumbe) spirite, a spirite of
knowledge and holy Light.</P>
<P><HI>Obiect.</HI> But every one (who is to be ho|ped
to haue Gods spirite) cannot vtter
words orderly as were to be wished.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="97">
<HI>Ans.</HI> That is besides the Question: the
Question is this: <HI>Can every one of God his
children</HI> (meaning of aged Persons) <HI>pray
rightly?</HI> I haue saide, they can. Nowe, for
praying so orderly as were to be wished,
I graunt, that young ones in Christ Iesus
cannot pray so fully and methodically, as
these that haue spent som years in Christ
his Schoole. Children cannot speake as
do Elder persons: yet Children (aswell as
Elder persons) can cry vnto the Parents
vpon the feling of some <HI>Want:</HI> even so can
the youngest Babe in Christ. That, the
blessed Apostle teacheth, (<HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 15.)
when he saith, that the <HI>Adopted do cry:</HI> as
also (<HI>Verse,</HI> 26. 27.) when hee affirmeth,
that the Spirit teacheth vs to pray <HI>vvith
grones vnvtterable,</HI> the meaning of which
grones is well knowne to God: for hee is
not ignorant of the meaning of his own
spirit. And most grosse headed are such,
as think that any words please God, but
what hee himselfe first breathes into our
hearts by his spirit: for he only accepteth
the fruites of his owne spirit, the fruits of
his Sonnes spirit: which first fruites are
the sanctifier of our whole lumpe. Other|wise
to think is flat Idolatrie, and dero|ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">orie
to the spirite of our onely Sacri|ficer
IESVS.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="98">
<HI>Quest.</HI> Do you then simply condemne
all such as vse the wordes of our Saviour,
as they are set downe?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> No: S. <HI>Peter</HI> (1. 4. 11.) saith, <HI>If
any man speake, let him speake as the vvords
of God.</HI> Better wordes than our Saviour,
than the Apostles, than the Prophetes
haue vsed, we cannot vse: nay, wee must
learne to speake as they before vs haue
spoken, as in other speach, so specially in
<HI>Prayer,</HI> which is, <HI>An holy speach vvith
God.</HI> Whosoever shal vse all or any of our
Saviors words according to knowledge,
and that by the instinct of God his spirit,
which Spirit teacheth the soule, what is
most fit &amp; necessary for the time, to him I
say, <HI>Go in peace.</HI> But if any for customes
sake, and of a foolish superstitious affecti|on
to the words, shall vse them, or any o|ther

<P>OH, dul heart, vn|towarde
Soule,
why art thou so lumpish and so
heavie? trust in God thy delive|rer:
cast out, yea breath strong|lie
out, what God his spirit hath
conceived in thee, &ocirc; my heart.</P>
<P>Sweete <HI>Father,</HI> when thou by
thy powerful word had created
all Creatures for <HI>Man</HI> his vse,
then thou created <HI>Man</HI> and <HI>Wo|man</HI>
to vse them. Man thou didst
make of the earth, woman thou
took from Mans side, by draw|ing
from thence a <HI>Rib,</HI> whereof
<PB N="195" REF="99">
thou builded <HI>Her,</HI> that she vnto
him might be an <HI>Helper.</HI> And so
(having put thy Image in them)
thou placed them in <HI>Eden,</HI> yea,
in the garden of <HI>Eden,</HI> the beau|tie
of the whol earth, vnto them
thou gaue two Commaunde|ments:
the first, <HI>That they should
dresse the garden:</HI> the second, <HI>That
they should not eate of the tree entit|led,
The Tree of Knowledge of good
and euill,</HI> and so they should liue,
whereof thou gaue them an o|ther
Tree, sacramentally called,
<HI>The tree of Life:</HI> but if they diso|beyed,
then in the Daye of such
disobedience, <HI>They should die.</HI> But
thy commandeme~ts were soone
broken: for Satan (adversary to
thy glory &amp; Mans wel-fare) did
even in the same daye possesse
the Dragon (the subtillest beast
of the fielde) and speaking with
the <HI>Beasts</HI> mouth, <HI>Woman</HI> negle|cted
<PB N="196" REF="100">
her Calling, and with an
idle eare stood harkening vnto
the Serpentes voice, by whose
subteltie, she was soone drawne
to break the other commande|ment;
and then by <HI>Her</HI> was man
also caryed into Transgression.
<HI>Sinne</HI> so seazing on their <HI>Bodies

and Corruption effe|cted
the period of death. Sinne
seazing (not on the Substance,
but) on the <HI>Faculties</HI> or <HI>powers</HI> of
the Soule, thereby it came to
passe, that their souls were <HI>Pow|erfull</HI>
in the waies of perpetuall
death, but vnable to all <HI>Good.</HI></P>
<P>Sweete Father, as their Crea|tion
was the Creation of the
<HI>Matter</HI> whereof all Mankinde
is come; so, this fearfull <HI>Fall</HI> was
not onely to them <HI>Two,</HI> but to
<HI>Me</HI> and all <HI>Mankinde:</HI> conside|ring

their loynes. A fountain of gall,
can send forth no sweet waters:
nor could wee bee borne <HI>Holy,</HI>
that were conceived in Sin. As
is the Roote, even such are the
branches, nay, our <HI>Actuall</HI> sinnes
do testifie, that that <HI>Original</HI> sin
was convayed vnto vs in our
<HI>Nature:</HI> by reason wherof, I and
<HI>All Mankinde</HI> haue beene justly
vnder thy <HI>Curse.</HI> Oh that wee
should fall from thee our <HI>Crea|tor,</HI>
from thee our <HI>Father,</HI> that of
base earth did make vs glorious
creatures stamping in our souls
thy <HI>Image,</HI> whereof justly wee
were deprived: carrying vpon
vs (in steade thereof) the <HI>Blacke
vnholy</HI> Image of Satan.</P>
<P>But thou <HI>Our</HI> sweete <HI>Father,</HI>
didst thou vtterly leaue Man|kind
to be damned with Satan?
Oh, no. Thou soughtest vp our
fore-parents (<HI>Adam</HI> &amp; <HI>Heuah</HI>)
<PB N="198" REF="101">
and Catechized them: freely,
promising vnto them, that of
womans <HI>Seed</HI> one should come,
by whome the seed of man and
woman shuld overcome Satan.
When the fulnesse of time was
expired, thou accordingly didst
send thy <HI>Sonne made of a vvoman,</HI>
who in our Nature triumphed
over Sinne, Death, Hell, Sathan,
and so finaly sitteth at the right
hand of Majestie, making con|tinuall
intercession for all such
of Man-kinde, as do come vnto
thee (oh Father) by him: in and
by whome, Salvation onely is
come vnto Iewe and Gentile.</P>
<P>Thus, when of a <HI>Father,</HI> we had
justly made thee our <HI>Foe,</HI> it plea|sed
thee, sweete Father, to ap|point
a Mediator betwixt thee
and vs, that so by him, thou and
wee might bee reconciled and
made one. Oh Mercie of mer|cies,

(that at what time soever a
sinner doeth repent him from
the bottome of his heart) thou
wilt wype all his trespasses out

repentant harts, bleeding harts,
that so every our iniquities may
be crossed out of thy book, and
blotted foorth of thy remem|brance.</P>
<P>This <HI>Remission,</HI> and blotting
out, oh Lord, it cannot fall out
by any vertue in our selues, but
by vertue of that humiliation
of Iesus, who by thee was bro|ken
for our sins, and by whose
stripes we <HI>Onely</HI> are healed: yet
(oh Father) in as much as for
whome thy Son was so broken,
vnto them thou likewise giues
contrite and broken spirits, by
vertue of which contrition, (as

by a seale) they ever rest assured
of thy free favour in Christ Ie|sus
towards them, we therefore
humblie beg a continuance of
Contrition, and all other the

<P>Because wee carrie mercifull
