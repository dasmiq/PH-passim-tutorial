<HEAD>THE BIRTH OF THE MUSE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>DEscend, Celestial <HI>Muse</HI>! thy Son inspire</L>
<L>Of thee to sing; infuse the Holy Fire.</L>
<L>Belov'd of Gods and Men, thy self disclose;</L>
<L>Say, from what Source thy Heav'nly Pow'r arose,</L>
<L>Which from unnumb'red Years deliv'ring down</L>
<L>The Deeds of Heroes deathless in Renown,</L>
<L>Extends their Life and Fame to Ages yet unknown.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Time</HI> and the <HI>Muse</HI> set forth with equal Pace;</L>
<L>At once the Rivals started to the Race:</L>
<L>And both at once the destin'd Course shall end,</L>
<L>Or both to all Eternity Contend.</L>
<L>One to preserve what t' other cannot save,</L>
<L>And rescue Vertue rising from the Grave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To thee, O <HI>Montague,</HI> these Strains are sung,</L>
<L>For thee my Voice is tun'd, and speaking Lyre is strung;</L>
<L>For ev'ry Grace of ev'ry <HI>Muse</HI> is thine,</L>
<L>In thee their various Fires united shine,</L>
<L>Darling of <HI>Phaebus</HI> and the tunefull Nine!</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="3">To thee alone I dare my Song Commend,</L>
<L>Whose Nature can forgive, and Pow'r defend,</L>
<L>And shew by turns the Patron and the Friend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Begin, my <HI>Muse,</HI> from <HI>Iove</HI> derive thy Song,</L>
<L>Thy Song of right, does first to <HI>Iove</HI> belong:</L>
<L>For thou thy self art of Celestial Seed,</L>
<L>Nor dare a Sire inferiour boast the Breed.</L>
<L>When first the Frame of this vast Ball was made,</L>
<L>And <HI>Iove</HI> with Joy the finish'd Work survey'd;</L>
<L>Then change of Things, the rise and fall of States,</L>
<L>Tho' yet to come, were destin'd by the Fates.</L>
<L>Then <HI>Time</HI> had first a Name; by firm Decree</L>
<L>Appointed Lord of all Futurity.</L>
<L>Within whose spacious Womb the Fates repose</L>
<L>Causes of Things, and secret Seeds enclose,</L>
<L>Which ripening there, shall one Day gain a Birth,</L>
<L>And force a Passage thro' the teeming Earth.</L>
<L>To him they gave, to rule the spacious Light,</L>
<L>And bound the yet unparted Day and Night;</L>
<L>To wing the Hours that whirl the rowling Sphere</L>
<L>To shift the Seasons, and conduct the Year.</L>
<L>The Term of Empires, and Extent of Power</L>
<L>To him they trust, and fix each fated Hour.</L>
<L>This mighty Rule, to <HI>Time</HI> the Fates ordain,</L>
<L>But yet to hard Conditions bind his Reign.</L>
<L>For ev'ry beauteous Birth he brings to light,</L>
<L>(How good soe'er and grateful in his sight,)</L>
<L>He must again to Native Earth restore,</L>
<L>And all his Race with Iron Teeth devour.</L>
<L>Nor Good, nor Great shall scape his hungry Maw,</L>
<L>But bleeding Nature prove the rigid Law.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="3" REF="3">
<L>Not yet, the loosned Earth aloft was flung,</L>
<L>Or pois'd amid the Skies in ballance hung.</L>
<L>Nor yet, did Golden Fires the Sun adorn,</L>
<L>Or borrow'd Lustre silver <HI>Cynthia</HI>'s Horn.</L>
<L>Nor yet, had <HI>Time</HI> Commission to begin.</L>
<L>Or Fate the many-twisted Web to spin;</L>
<L>When all the Heav'nly Host assembled came</L>
<L>To view the World yet resting on its Frame;</L>
<L>Eager they press, to see the Sire dismiss</L>
<L>And rowl the Globe along the vast Abyss.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But deep revolving Thoughts the God retain,</L>
<L>Which for a space suspend the promis'd Scene.</L>
<L>Again, his Eyes inspect <HI>Time</HI>'s pregnant Womb,</L>
<L>Again, he reads the World's predestin'd Doom.</L>
<L>Abroad the bulky Volume he displays,</L>
<L>And present views the Deeds of future Days.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A beauteous Prospect paints the foremost Page,</L>
<L>Where Nature's Bloom presents the Golden Age.</L>
<L>The Golden Leaf to Silver soon resigns,</L>
<L>And fair the Sheet, but yet more faintly shines.</L>
<L>Of baser Brass, the next denotes the Times,</L>
<L>An impious Page deform'd with deadly Crimes.</L>
<L>The Fourth yet wears a worse and browner Face,</L>
<L>And adds to Gloomy Days an Iron Race.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He turns the Book, and ev'ry Age reviews,</L>
<L>Then all the Kingly Line his Eye pursues:</L>
<L>The First of Men, and Lords of Earth design'd,</L>
<L>Who under him should rule the rest of Human-kind.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="4">Of Future Heroes, there, the Lives he reads,</L>
<L>In search of Glory spent, and Godlike Deeds;</L>
<L>Who Empires found, and goodly Cities build,</L>
<L>And Savage Men Compel to leave the Field.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All this th' Eternal saw, and seen approv'd;</L>
<L>When Lo! but thence a Narrow Space remov'd,</L>
<L>And Hungry <HI>Time</HI> has all the Scene defac'd,</L>
<L>The Kings destroy'd, and laid the Kingdoms waste:</L>
<L>Together all in Common Ruins lie,</L>
<L>And but anon and ev'n the Ruins die.</L>
<L>Th' Almighty, inly touch'd, Compassion found,</L>
<L>To see Great Actions in Oblivion drown'd;</L>
<L>And forward search the Roll, to find if Fate</L>
<L>Had no Reserve to spare the Good and Great.</L>
<L>Bright in his View the <HI>Trojan</HI> Heroes shine,</L>
<L>And <HI>Ilian</HI> Structures rais'd by Hands Divine;</L>
<L>But <HI>Ilium</HI> soon in Native Dust is laid,</L>
<L>And all her boasted Pile a Ruine made:</L>
<L>Not Great <HI>Aeneas</HI> can her Fall withstand,</L>
<L>But flies, to save his Gods, to foreign Land.</L>
<L>The <HI>Roman</HI> Race, succeed the <HI>Pardan</HI> State,</L>
<L>And first and second <HI>Caesar</HI> God-like Great.</L>
<L>Still on to after-days his Eyes descend;</L>
<L>And rising Heroes still the Search attend.</L>
<L>Proceeding thus he many Empires pass'd;</L>
<L>But fair <HI>Britania</HI> fix'd his Sight at last.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Above the Waves she lifts her Silver Head,</L>
<L>And looks a <HI>Venus</HI> born from Ocean's Bed.</L>
<L>For rowling Years, her happy Fortunes smile,</L>
<L>And Fates propitious bless the beauteous Isle;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="4">To Worlds remote, she wide extends her Reign,</L>
<L>And wields the Trident of the stormy Main.</L>
<L>Thus on the Base of Empire firm she stands,</L>
<L>While bright <HI>Eliza</HI> rules the willing Lands.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But soon a Lowring Sky comes on apace,</L>
<L>And Fate revers'd shews her ill-omen'd Face.</L>
<L>The Void of Heav'n a Gloomy Horrour fills,</L>
<L>And Cloudy Veils involve her shining Hills;</L>
<L>Of Greatness pass'd no Footsteps she retains,</L>
<L>Sunk in a <HI>Series</HI> of Inglorious Reigns.</L>
<L>She feels the Change, and deep regrets the Shame</L>
<L>Of Honours lost, and her diminish'd Name:</L>
<L>Conscious, she seeks from Day to shrowd her Head,</L>
<L>And glad would shrink beneath her Oozy Bed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus far, the Sacred Leaves <HI>Britania</HI>'s Woes</L>
<L>In shady Draughts, and dusky Lines disclose.</L>
<L>Th' ensuing Scene revolves a Martial Age,</L>
<L>And ardent Colours gild the glowing Page.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Behold! of radiant Light an Orb arise,</L>
<L>Which kindling Day, restores the darkned Skies;</L>
<L>And see! on Seas the beamy Ball descends,</L>
<L>And now its Course to fair <HI>Britania</HI> bends:</L>
<L>Along the foamy Main the Billows bear</L>
<L>The floating Fire, and wast the shining Sphere.</L>
<L>Hail, happy <HI>Omen</HI>! Hail, auspicious Sight!</L>
<L>Thou glorious Guide to yet a greater Light.</L>
<L>For see! a Prince, whom dazling Arms array,</L>
<L>Pursuing closely, plows the wat'ry Way,</L>
<L>And tracks the Glory thro' the flaming Sea.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="5">
<L><HI>Britania,</HI> rise; awake, O Fairest Isle,</L>
<L>From Iron Sleep; again thy Fortunes smile.</L>
<L>Once more look up, the Mighty Man behold,</L>
<L>Whose Reign renews another Age of Gold.</L>
<L>The Fates at length the Blissful Web have spun,</L>
<L>And bid it round in Endless Circles run.</L>
<L>Again, shall distant Lands Confess thy Sway,</L>
<L>Again, the wat'ry World thy Rule Obey;</L>
<L>Again, thy Martial Sons shall thirst for Fame,</L>
<L>And win in foreign Fields a deathless Name,</L>
<L>For <HI>WILLIAM</HI>'s Genius ev'ry Soul inspires,</L>
<L>And warms the frozen Youth with warlike Fires.</L>
<L>Already, see, the Hostile Troops retreat,</L>
<L>And seem forwarn'd of their impending Fate.</L>
<L>Already routed Foes his Fury feel,</L>
<L>And fly the Force of his unerring Steel.</L>
<L>The haughty <HI>Gaul,</HI> who well till now, might boast,</L>
<L>A Matchless Sword and unresisted Host,</L>
<L>At his Foreseen approach the Field forsakes;</L>
<L>His Cities tremble, and his Empire shakes.</L>
<L>His tow'ring Ensigns long had aw'd the Plain,</L>
<L>And Fleets audaciously usurp'd the Main;</L>
<L>A gathering Storm he seem'd, which from afar</L>
<L>Teem'd with a Deluge of destructive War.</L>
<L>Till <HI>WILLIAM</HI>'s stronger Genius soar'd above,</L>
<L>And down the Skies the daring Tempest drove.</L>
<L>So from the radiant Sun, retires the Night,</L>
<L>And Western Clouds shot thro' with adverse Light.</L>
<L>So when th' assuming God, whom Storms Obey,</L>
<L>To all the warring Winds at once gave way;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="5">The frantick Brethren ravag'd all around,</L>
<L>And Rocks, and Woods, and Shoars their Rage resound;</L>
<L>Incumbent o're the Main, at length they sweep</L>
<L>The liquid Plains, and raise the peaceful Deep:</L>
<L>But when superiour <HI>Neptune</HI> leaves his Bed,</L>
<L>His Trident shakes, and shews his awful Head;</L>
<L>The madding Winds are hush'd, the Tempests cease,</L>
<L>And ev'ry rowling Surge resides in Peace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now the Sacred Leaf a Landskip wears,</L>
<L>Where, Heav'n serene, and Air unmov'd appears.</L>
<L>The <HI>Rose</HI> and <HI>Lilly</HI> paint the verdant Plains,</L>
<L>And <HI>Palm</HI> and <HI>Olive</HI> shade the Sylvan Scenes.</L>
<L>The Peaceful <HI>Thames,</HI> beneath his Banks abides,</L>
<L>And soft, and still, the Silver Surface glides.</L>
<L>The <HI>Zephyrs</HI> fan the Fields, the whisp'ring Breeze</L>
<L>With fragrant Breath remurmurs thro' the Trees.</L>
<L>The warbling Birds applauding new-born Light,</L>
<L>In wanton Measures wing their airy Flight.</L>
<L>Above the Floods the sinny Race repair,</L>
<L>And bound aloft, and bask in upper Air;</L>
<L>They gild their scaly Backs in <HI>Phaebus</HI> Beams,</L>
<L>And scorn to skim the Level of the Streams.</L>

<L>No more the Lab'ring Hind regrets his Toil,</L>
