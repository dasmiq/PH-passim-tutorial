<P>Having heard from those Persons who have of|ten the Happiness of waiting on You, how easie an Access You give to All, I have presum'd to ask the Honor of being admitted into Your Presence.
<PB REF="4">
If this Address may be thought too forward, it will be some Excuse, to have it known, that I was justly afraid of being prevented by those Numbers of Men, Eminent in all Faculties and Professions, who are preparing to make the same Attempt upon You. The <HI>Peace,</HI> which His Most Sacred <HI>MAJESTY</HI> has with the greatest Glory brought Home to us, as much as it owes to the Influence of Your particular Counsels, will be very far from allowing You any Share of that Rest, which it affords to all <HI>Europe</HI> besides: Believe me, <HI>SIR,</HI> the Men of Letters knowing now, that Your Thoughts are no longer taken up by the <HI>War,</HI> are all ready to break in upon You with their Offerings; they look on You as their declar'd Patron and Protector; they have upon this Prospect recover'd their Spirits, and en|larg'd their Hopes; and some of them have gone so far, as to think they find You Born for their Advancement, under that very Star, which was never before observ'd to shine out in all its Lustre, but only at the Birth of the Roman <HI>Mecaenas,</HI> and the French <HI>Rich|lieu</HI> and <HI>Colbert.</HI></P>

<P>The Favor of Great Ministers to the Learn|ed, is a Subject that takes up but little Room in our <HI>British Annals.</HI> It has been thought to be the Defect of some Former Reigns, Fa|mous in all other respects; and was reserv'd, we believe, to Compleat the Glories of This.

<HEAD>THE INTRODUCTION Explaining the ANIMAL OECONOMY.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Contemplation of Humane Bodies is doubtless one of the most Diverting and Noble A|musements, in which a Philo|sophical Mind can employ it self. The Structure, Contri|vance, and Disposition of the Parts are Astonishing, and we can hardly desire more plain and convincing Proofs of the Wisdom and Providence of the Author of Nature, than what may be deduc'd from this Source. How surpizing are the Discoveries which the Hap|py Industry of the present Age has made in the Animal World: The Doctrine of the Circulation of the Blood; the <HI>Vnity</HI> of the Veins and Arteries; the Origin and Distribution of the Chyle and <HI>Lympha</HI>; the <HI>Ovaria</HI> in Females; the <HI>Em|briunculi</HI> in the Masculine Seed, are equally certain and ama|zing; besides a Multitude of other Curious Observations we Daily make by the Help of Microscopes, Mercurial Inje|ctions, and such like Methods.</P>
<P>These are sufficient Motives to induce all Inquisitive Per|sons, and Lovers of Natural History, to the Study of <HI>Ana|tomy</HI>; but all Professors of Medicine are more immediately concern'd to be Acquainted with it; this being little less than the <HI>Basis</HI> and Foundation of their Art. Without a due Knowledge of the Animal Mechanism, I doubt all our Attempts to Explain the Multiform Appearance of Ani|mal Bodies, will be Vain and Ineffectual, and our Ideas of the Causes of Diseases and their Symptoms, as Extravagant and Absurd as those of the <HI>Chinese</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI>; nay I am afraid the whole Art of Physick will be little better than Em|pirical.</P>
<P>But if the Knowledge of our Bodies do's so much con|duce to advance true Philosophy and Medicine; it is not less required in the Practice of Surgery: In this Case it seems not meerly convenient, but absolutely necessary; I mean so far as concerns the External Parts, since the Ar|tist here, do's not as in the former Instances, Acquiesce in Contemplating his Subject, and the Manner how it is Affe|cted; but is often oblig'd to Perform some Difficult, and per|haps Hazardous Operation on it. For my Part I cannot forbear wondring at the Confidence of Ignorant Men, who dare Attack a Humane Body, make Incisions, apply Cau|sticks Actual and Potential; without a due Knowledge of the Site, Position, Dependance, and other necessary Conside|rations of the Parts concern'd. The Fatal Consequences of these bold Practices are frequently felt, an Instance or Two of which, are Accidentally shewn, <HI>Tab.</HI> 13. <HI>Fig.</HI> 1. <HI>Tab.</HI> 15. <HI>Fig.</HI> 2.</P>
<P>I must confess frequent seeing and assisting at Chirurgical Operations may dispose Men to Perform the like again, when Circumstances in all Points shall agree; but without a Com|petent, if not Accurate Knowledge of <HI>Anatomy,</HI> and actual Administration of Dissection, such Persons must be a long Time Spectators, before they can Arrive at a tolerable Pre|tence to a General Practice: And therefore as I cannot but deplore the Profound and Universal Ignorance which pre|vails, so I would candidly recommend it to most of the Sur|geons in this vast and populous City, to apply themselves with more Industry than they have hitherto done, to so Use|ful a Part of their Art; who would soon then be convinc'd this was no Dishonour to themselves, and cease to Reproach others who have spent some of their vacant Hours in these Exercises.</P>
<P>But this is foreign to my purpose, and therefore I shall Address my self to the Business now before me, which is to Present the Reader with a Brief and General Plan of the <HI>Animal Oeconomy,</HI> as an Introduction to the following Ta|bles.</P>
<P>All the Functions of an Animate Body may be well enough divided into <HI>Natural</HI> and <HI>Animal</HI>; by <HI>Natural,</HI> I mean all which Terminate in the Body, and Conduce to the preserva|tion of the Individual or Propagation of the Species; by <HI>Animal,</HI> I understand such, in which the Soul is concern'd, which in Regard of the Body to which it is United, are Pas|sive or Active; the First is Sense; the Latter Voluntary Mo|tion. For the more Orderly Distribution of the Whole, we shall first Treat of the Former, leaving the <HI>Animal</HI> Fun|ctions to succeed; and here we shall follow the Process of Nature; beginning with the First Reception of the Aliment in the Mouth, and pursuing it thence thro' its several Sta|ges.</P>
<P>After the Aliment is taken into the Mouth, (for the more Commodious doing of which, the <HI>Dentes Incisorii</HI> are often Employ'd) it here suffers Comminution, and is mixt with <HI>Sa|liva,</HI> which is Previous to the Second Preparation, it receives in the Stomach. This Operation is call'd Mastication, and is perform'd by the Lower Jaw, Variously mov'd by its Pro|per Muscles, and Assisted by the Tongue, Cheeks, and Lips; which last, still apply the Less divided Parts of the Mass, to the <HI>Dentes Molares,</HI> for it's due Comminution; while all the Neighbouring Muscles in their several Actions, Compress the Parotid, Maxillary, Sublingual Salivary Glands, and those of the Lips, Cheeks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and force them to Discharge their Contents to mix with the Masticated Aliment, now ready for <HI>Deglutition.</HI></P>
<P>The Aliment after it has undergone this Alteration, do's not Descend into the Stomach by its own Weight, but is con|vey'd thither by the joint Action of the Muscles of the Tongue, <HI>Os Hyoides, Fauces,</HI> and <HI>Oesophagus</HI>; all which Con|spire in <HI>Deglutition,</HI> by Raising and Dilating the <HI>Gula,</HI> and Protruding the Meat into it. The whole Action do's very much resemble the pouring Corn into a Sack, and is done in the Manner I shall just now Describe. The Root of the Tongue being Deprest by means of its Muscular Fibres, its Tip and Sides are applied in a Semicircular Manner, to the Insides of the whole Range of Teeth of the Upper Jaw or Gums, when these happen to be wanting; and the Whole in this Position is drawn Upwards, by the <HI>Musculi Styloglossi</HI> and <HI>Stylohyoidei, Tab.</HI> 14. <HI>Fig.</HI> 1. <HI>Tab.</HI> 15. <HI>Fig.</HI> 1. At the same Time the <HI>Fauces</HI> are Rais'd by the <HI>Musculi Stylopharyngaei,</HI> which by their Oblique Position, (as is Noted <HI>App. Fig.</HI> 38.) draw open their Mouth, and Dilate that Cavity. Now Two Thirds at least of the Upper Surface of the Tongue, being applied to the Roof of the Mouth, and drawn as we have now Describ'd, Upwards, and Inwards; the <HI>Epiglottis</HI> is De|prest in such Manner, that the Aliment is Protruded over it (as on a Bridge) into the Dilated Cavity of the <HI>Fauces,</HI> and thence by the Contraction of the <HI>Musculus Pterygopharyn|gaeus</HI> and <HI>Oesophagaeus, App. Fig.</HI> 38. it is Deprest into the <HI>Gulae,</HI> which Helps its Descent into the Stomach, by the Action of its Muscular Fibres.</P>
<P>We must not omit to observe here, That in the In|stant the Aliment passes thro' the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of the Throat, the <HI>Gargareon</HI> is drawn Upwards and Backwards, by the <HI>Musculi Sphaenostaphylini,</HI> (Exprest <HI>Append. Fig.</HI> 8.) and the
<PB REF="7">
<HI>Foramina Narium</HI> by this means occluded, while the <HI>Epiglottis</HI> below covers the <HI>Rimula,</HI> as was above Noted; and by this means the Matter in its Passage is hindred from Reverting by the Nose, or Descending into the Wind-Pipe; The first hap|pens when the <HI>Gargareon</HI> is wanting, whether by Venerial Ex|ulcerations or otherwise; or Intumified and Inflamed as in the Small Pox, and cannot yield to this Motion. We may like|wise Note, That the <HI>Musculus Mylohyoideus</HI> (<HI>T.</HI> 15. <HI>F.</HI> 1.) in its Action does press the Sublingual and Maxillary Glands, and force them to discharge their secreted Liquors, by the <HI>Papillae,</HI> situated at the <HI>Fraenum</HI> or Ligament of the Tongue; and that the Muscles which Contract the <HI>Fauces,</HI> have the same Effect on the Tonsills and other Glands of that Part; all which Liquors, discharged from the Mouths of their Excretory Channels, do facilitate the Passage thro' the <HI>Gula,</HI> and serve to Compose the Stomachick <HI>Menstruum</HI>; of which further in the next Paragraph.</P>
<P>After the Aliment, thus alter'd by Comminution and Ad|mistion with the <HI>Saliva,</HI> is received into the Stomach, we proceed next to consider, how its Second Preparation is perform'd. The great Agent in Digestion is the Sto|machick Juice, secreted from the Blood by numerous Glands in this Part, and discharged into its Cavity, in Conjun|ction with the Spittle. This is that which acts promptly upon the Meat lodg'd in the Capacity of the Stomach, and from the Mixture of these two Juices, is compounded a proper <HI>Menstruum,</HI> by which the Parts of the Aliment are dissolved, and receive their first Transmutation with|in the Body. In this Action, which is a Dissolution of the Texture of the Alimentary Mass, the Aerial Parts included in its Pores, now escape from their former Prisons, and being rarified, distend the whole Body of the Stomach; and this I take to be the true Reason why most Men have less Appetite at some distance of Time, <HI>viz.</HI> when this Intu|mescence is made, than immediately after they cease from Eating: From the same Cause arise frequent Eructations, great Inflation from divers <HI>Meats,</HI> such as Old Pease, Cabbage, Roots, Herbs, and other Vegetables, which very much disturb decay'd debilitated Stomachs. I am apt to suspect the Stomachick <HI>Menstruum</HI> may excite an Intestine motion of the Particles of the Mass in Digestion; which yet I do not think fit to call Fermentation, fearing so bold a Term may mislead us into a False Idea of a greater Con|flict than really happens.</P>
<P>The Intumescence or Dilatation of the Stomach has two Effects: First to compress the Gall Bladder and <HI>Pancreas,</HI> and oblige their <HI>Ductus Excretorii</HI> to spue out their Contents into the <HI>Duodenum</HI>; next to retard the Refluent Blood, and by this means dispose the Muscular Fibres of the Ventricle to a Contraction. The Reason of this last Hint will appear by what we have offer'd concerning Muscular Motion, in the Introduction to our <HI>Myotomia Reformata.</HI></P>
<P>For the Cause of Hunger which is an observable <HI>Phaeno|menon</HI> belonging to this part, I conceive it to be an Irrita|tion of the Stomach, arising from a copious Quantity of this <HI>Menstruum,</HI> when it wants Matter to act upon. This con|jecture seems more probable, since it is Natural to discharge the Spittle out of the Mouth which comes into it at that Time, rather than suffer it to descend into the Stomach; and we may perpetually observe a depraved Appetite does follow a Vitiation of the <HI>Saliva,</HI> as in Scorbutick Ha|bits, Salivations by Mercurial Medicines, and such like Cases.</P>
<P>When the Mass is sufficiently prepar'd and reduced to a Pultaceous Consistence, the Stomach by the help of its Mus|cular Fibres contracts it self, and expels its Contents thro' the <HI>Pylorus</HI> into the <HI>Duodenum</HI>; where the Digested Mass is mixed with the Bile and Pancreatick Juice, (forced to discharge it self here as was just now described) which Volatilize, Subtiliate, and Separate the more Fluid and Fine Parts of the Aliment, from the more Impure and Gross, and here it is that Chylification is first made perfect. Now the Bile abounding with Lixivial Salt, is apt to intangle with the grosser Parts of the Chylaceous Mass, and its Saline Qua|lity not only cleanses the Cavities of the Guts from the <HI>Mucus,</HI> Excreted by their Glands (<HI>App. Fig.</HI> 40.) (to smear their Inmost Coat, and defend the <HI>Ostia</HI> of the Lacteal Ves|sels from being injured by Extraneous Bodies, which may happen to pass that way) but Stimulates the Intestines in their Peristaltick Motion.</P>
<P>The Peristaltick or Wormlike Motion of the Guts being thus Accelerated by the Acrimony of the Bile, the Contents of the Intestines are carried on, and the Thinner and more Fluid Parts, fitted for the Pores of the Lacteal Vessels, is absorbed by them, and the Thicker move on more slowly, till by the many Stops they meet with in the Connivent Valves, all the Chyle is at length absorbed, and the Remains being meerly Excrementitious, are only fit to be excluded by Stool.</P>
<P>This Vermicular Motion of the Guts, is perform'd by the Alternate Contraction of their Longitudinal and Transverse Fibres, (<HI>App. Fig.</HI> 39.40.) which at the same Time convey the Digested Mass thro' the Intestinal Tube, and express the Chyle into the Orifices of the Lacteal Ves|sels adapted to receive it; whose Progress from the Intestines, till it is discharged into the Mass of Blood, next presents it self to our Consideration: By the reciprocal Action of these differing Fibres, and the Apposition of the Connivent Valves (<HI>Tab.</HI> 39. <HI>Fig.</HI> 2.) the Chyle is forced into the Lacteal Vessels, <HI>Tab. ib. Fig.</HI> 1.) and hence it is we cannot make any Fluid pass from the Cavity of the Guts into the same Vessels, when the Peristaltick Motion ceases. A farther Use of the Con|traction of these Muscular Fibres, is to Accelerate the Chyle in its Progress, till the <HI>Lympha</HI> derived from the Arteries of the Guts joyn with it, which is done before it leaves the External Surface of the Intestines; by this Addition the Chyle is diluted and assisted in its Progress towards the Me|senterick Glands; in the Cells of which it is a Second Time Mixed with a Juice or Lymphatick Liquor there Secreted from the Arteries, and so carried on to the <HI>Vasa Lactea se|cundi Generis.</HI> These Vessels resembling Pipes, convey the Chyle from hence, all emptying themselves into the <HI>Common Receptacle</HI> or <HI>Cistern</HI>; the happy Discovery of which, we owe to the Observation of Mons. <HI>Pecquet</HI>: It is here the <HI>Lympha</HI> re|turned from the Inferior Limbs and adjacent Parts, is mixed with the Chyle, (<HI>App. Fig.</HI> 11.) which not only serves to di|lute, but promotes its Ascent thro' the Thoracick Duct, (<HI>Fig. ib.</HI>) to the Lest Subclavian Vein, (<HI>Fig. ib.</HI>) where this Channel empties its Contents into the main Current of the Blood. If we consider in this Duct, its several Divisions and Inosculations, (resembling the Veins of the Testicles) its numerous Valves looking from below Upwards, its advan|tageous Situation between the Great Artery and <HI>Vertebrae</HI> of the Back, together with the Ducts discharging their Refluent <HI>Lympha</HI> from the Lungs, and the other Neighbouring Parts, we shall find all conduce to demonstrate the utmost Art of Nature, used in furthering the Steep and Perpendicular Ascent of the Chyle; which Beautiful Order is Represented <HI>App. Fig.</HI> 11. and cannot but equally Create in us Delight and Admiration.</P>
<P>Having traced this Animal Juice to its Reception into the Blood, with which it is at last Circulated and Assimulated, we shall proceed to the Blood it self, whose Circular Motion, the various Artifices of Nature for adjusting the Proportions and other subordinate Contrivances; the Manner and Cause of the Contraction of the Heart and Arteries, Respiration, with the whole Theory of the <HI>Lympha</HI> and Glandular Secretion in the Order of Nature, follow.</P>
<P>The Refluent Blood in the Upper and Lower Trunk of the <HI>Vena Cava</HI> meeting in the Right Auricle of the Heart, is thence expelled by its Contraction into the Right Ventricle, when the Heart is in its Diastole; but by its Systole or Con|traction, it is thence driven into the <HI>Arteria Pulmonaris,</HI> from whose Capillary Vessels it passes into the Extremities of the <HI>Vena Pulmonaris,</HI> and thence returning, is discharged into the Left Auricle and Ventricle of the Heart: From whence it is again by the Systole driven into the <HI>Aorta,</HI> by whose Branches it is convey'd thro' the whole System of the Body: But when it arrives in the Capillary Arteries, it do's not stop there, but passes into the like Capillary Veins, and from thence into the greater Branches, next into the Trunk of the <HI>Vena Cava,</HI> and so into the Right Ventricle again. In the mean time the Three Tricuspid Valves in the Right (<HI>Tab.</HI> 22. <HI>Fig.</HI> 6.) and the two Mitral Valves (<HI>Tab. ead. Fig.</HI> 12.) in the Left Ventricle of the Heart, oppose its return into the <HI>Vena Cava</HI> and <HI>Vena Pulmonaris</HI>; and the Semilunary Valves of the <HI>Arteria Pulmonaris</HI> (<HI>Tab. ead. Fig.</HI> 14.) and <HI>Aorta,</HI> (<HI>Tab. ib. Fig.</HI> 13.) prevent its Reflux into the Ventricles. The Structure and Position of which Membranes, are sufficient alone to lead all Observing Men into a compleat Knowledge of its Motion and Progress.</P>
<P>The Circular Motion of the Blood was first Explain'd, and the whole Demonstrated in a Treatise expresly Writ upon that Subject, and Published in the Year 1628. by our Learned and Ingenious Dr. <HI>Harvey</HI>; To omit all dis|putes here how far this was known to <HI>Cesalpinus, Colum|bus, Servetus,</HI> or any of the Anatomists or Virtuoso's of the last Age. But the Manner how this Animal Liquor is transmitted from the Arteries to the Veins, has remained hitherto a Secret, and afforded Matter of Controversie. Some pretend this is done by some blind Imperceptible <HI>Meatus</HI> in the Carnous Parts, and perplex themselves to give Irrational and Chimerical Accounts, which we shall not here lose Time to enumerate or refute. But the late great Improvement of Microscopes has put an end to all these un|certain Conjectures, by discovering to our Naked Eye, that the Veins and Arteries are but one continued inflected Tube, and the Blood passes from one to the other in an uninterrupted Current; which Unity of the Blood-Vessels by a Parity of Reason, we infer extends to the whole System, and will hardly be questioned by those who consider the Prompt Pas|sage of Mercury, and other injected Liquors from the Ar|teries to the Veins, or see the Globules of Blood passing these <HI>Angustia,</HI> and reverting with incredible Rapidity in the
<PB REF="7">
Fins of Fishes; (<HI>App. F.</HI> 4, 5.) which curious Discovery ought not to be reputed the least Advancement which this Part of Natural History has receiv'd.</P>
<P>The great Engine which sets all this Motion on Foot, is the Heart, (<HI>Tab.</HI> 22. <HI>Fig.</HI> 9.) by whose repeated Elastick Con|traction, the Blood is driven to the remotest Parts thro' the Arterial System, (<HI>App. Fig.</HI> 3.) and forced to continue its Motion back thro' the Venous Channels. This Elastick Force is primarily seated in its own Muscular Fibres, whose Spiral Contortion (<HI>Tab.</HI> 22. <HI>Fig.</HI> 2, 3.) is very well described by Dr. <HI>Lower</HI> in his Book <HI>De Corde</HI>; but the Pendulous Position and the Fibres, which compose its Great Arteries, <HI>i. e.</HI> the <HI>Pul|monaris</HI> and <HI>Aorta,</HI> assist very much; and the Heart taken out of the Body and held up by the Arteries, will continue the least gentle Motion imprest on it for a considerable Time, which Effect can only be ascribed to the Elasticity of the Arterial Trunks by which it is suspended.</P>
<P>The Heart is the immediate Instrument, but what is the <HI>Vis Motrix</HI> which forces its Fibres to a Contraction, is a far greater Difficulty, and one of the most Abstruse, Inscrutable Myste|ries of Nature. It is in this respect our Bodies differ from Ar|tificial Machines; the Former having in themselves a perpetual Principle of Motion, which the Latter by no Invention of Men can arrive at. In my Opinion the Heart of an Animal bears a great Analogy to the Pendulums of those Artificial <HI>Automata,</HI> Clocks and Watches, whilst its Motion is per|form'd like that of other Muscles, the Blood doing the Office of a <HI>Pondus.</HI> The Observation of the Curious Mons. <HI>Peyer in Parergo Septimo,</HI> seems to favour this Opinion; who tells us, He has with Pleasure seen the Heart renew its Con|traction, by blowing into the Thoracick Duct, when the Parts have began to grow stiff after Death. The like Motion of the Heart I have more than once observ'd to be restor'd, by blowing into the Veins of a Dog, and pouring warm Water on it, or applying the Palm of the Hand not long after its Cessation.</P>
<P>Besides the Quantity, doubtless the Quality of the Blood has a Share, since all Distempers which alter the Mass, at the same Time create a Hurry and Disorder in its Motion. To explain the Action of the Blood in this Case, and the Influence it has over the Motion of the Heart, we must con|sider its Nature, Constituent Parts, and the Alterations it is disposed to receive. This Animal Fluid consists of Two Parts, Serous and Globular. The Distinction of these Parts of the Blood is evident to the Naked Eye, after its Stagna|tion in any Vessel, but is clearly evinced by the Microscope in its Circulation thro' the Tails and Fins of Fishes, and other Transparent Parts, in the same manner as is Repre|sented <HI>Appendix Fig.</HI> 4, 5. where the Globules seem to Swim in the <HI>Serum</HI> in this state of Mixture. Now the Blood being in this manner a Heterogeneous Liquor, Compos'd of Particles of various Magnitude and Figure, must be subject to an In|testine Motion; but the great Rapidity of its Current thro' the Arteries, and the <HI>Angustiae</HI> in the Extremities of the Blood-Vessels, not admitting any Retrograde Motion to be there made, it is deferr'd till it arrives in the Great Veins, where its Progress is retarded, and the Room more spatious, and the Intestine Motion there Commences, which arises to a Greater or Less Height, as the Blood is more or less Charged with Incon|gruous Parts. The Alteration which the Blood by this means receives, has no inconsiderable Share in the Heart's Con|traction; and tho it be not the prime efficient Cause, yet we cannot deny but that it is Partial and Incitative, as appears in Fevers and several other Distempers, where the whole Mass is Accelerated, and the Pulse more frequent.</P>
<P>Besides all these Causes, the Brain by its Nervous Trunks sent to this Part, which are very Thick and Tense, yet lie very loose, contributes much to this Action. And here we may observe, not only these of the Heart, but the whole System of Nerves which serve the <HI>Viscera</HI> in the <HI>Thorax</HI> and Lower Belly, have their Propagines very Numerous and Tense, notwith|standing which, they lie Loose or Free in their Progress from the Brain to their respective Parts; both which concur in dis|posing them to Receive and Retain all Impressions from their Extremities: This Faculty beginning to Exert it self even while the <HI>Foetus</HI> is in <HI>Vtero,</HI> grows Familiar and Natural, and from this early Habit and Practice of the Infant, they after perform their Duty Sleeping or Waking, without the least Advertence; but this by the by. And now if what has been Noted, shall be thought sufficient to give ground to Hope Future En|quiries may discover more Adequate Causes of this great <HI>Phaenomenon,</HI> we have obtained our Desire, and shall leave these Hints to be improv'd by Men of more Industry and Leasure.</P>
<P>Before we leave this Subject, we must not omit to Remark some Observable Artifices of Nature, for the better carrying on the Circulation. The First is the Valves placed in the several Divarications of the Veins, between their Capillar Extremities and Larger Trunks: These are Membranes pro|ceeding from the inner Coat of the Vessels, in the Form of a Crescent or <HI>C.</HI> which was the Ancient Greek <HI>Sigma,</HI> and are generally Double, with their Concavity looking towards the Heart, and readily give way to the Current of the Blood thither, as is Represented: (<HI>Tab.</HI> 23. <HI>F.</HI> 7.) But if by its Weight, or any other Cause, the Blood should Revert, they oppose it, and being Distended, prevent its Return from the Great Trunks of Veins to the Lesser, and at the same time hinder the Superincumbing Blood from pressing on the Inferior; con|cerning which consult <HI>Tab.</HI> 23. <HI>Fig.</HI> 6.</P>
<P>Another Considerable Artifice in Nature, is the Conveying great Quantities of Refluent Blood from several Parts of the Trunk by particular Channels, instead of discharging it by the next and most immediate Passage into the Neighbouring Cur|rent. Dr. <HI>Lower</HI> has well Observ'd, that the Heart is not placed in the Center of the Body, but inclines to its Upper Part, which Position is necessary to Drive the Blood in its Systole to the Head, with more Force then is required to make it Descend to the Feet, to which its own Weight and Fluidity do's not a little Conduce. Now the Heart being seated so near the Upper Part, as that Two Parts in Three of the whole Fabrick, appear to be below it, there must be a like Inequality of Blood sent to the Inferior Parts, to that which Ascends to the Superior. And this we see Confirm'd by comparing the Diameter of the Blood-Vessels Descending with the Ascending, the Former being much Larger then the Latter. This great Dispropor|tion of Blood in the Upper System to that of the Lower, seems to threaten a great Disturbance in the Animal Order, but is prevented by the Provident Care of the Author of Nature, in the Manner we are now about to Describe.</P>
<P>The Intercostal Arteries <HI>App. F.</HI> 3. which arise from the Low|er System, are accompanied with Veins (that Return the Blood they Exported) which do not enter into the next Large Trunk according to the ordinary Process of Nature in other Parts; but are all United into One Channel (and sometimes Two) which Ascends by the Side of the <HI>Aorta,</HI> and Empties it self into the Descending Trunk of the <HI>Vena Cava,</HI> there Discharging all its Refluent Blood; which had it been Inserted into the Ascending Trunk, it must have added so great a Weight, that the Blood could not have past up to the Heart, which it now easily do's. Beside these, the Mammary Veins likewise Empty themselves into the Subclavian, so that all the Blood Ari|sing from the <HI>Parietes</HI> of the <HI>Thorax,</HI> the Back and its Mus|cles, as well as those of the <HI>Scapulae,</HI> returns again to the Heart, by the Upper Trunk of the <HI>Vena Cava,</HI> tho' it was sent thi|ther from the Lower Trunk of the <HI>Arteria Magna.</HI></P>
<P>Another Contrivance of this Nature is Observable in the <HI>Vena Porta,</HI> which Receives the Blood from the Stomach, <HI>Omentum,</HI> Spleen, <HI>Pancreas,</HI> Guts and Mesentery, sent thither by the Coeliack and Mesenterick Arteries, which large Quan|tity had it Enter'd into the <HI>Vena Cava,</HI> immediately below the Liver or Kidneys, its Weight so far beneath the Diaphragm, must have Hindred its Ascent; wherefore the <HI>Vena Porta</HI> (not unlike the <HI>Azygos</HI> of the <HI>Thorax</HI> before Noted) carries up all the Blood by another Channel, and Discharges it into the Extremities of the <HI>Vena Cava</HI> within the Liver, where it is Diluted and Propell'd by the Refluent Blood from the Splenick Vein, and afterwards assisted in its Ascent, by the Contraction of the Diaphragm.</P>
<P>Here I cannot forbear making a Digression, and presenting my Conjectures of the Use and Office of the Spleen, since it ministers in this Part of the <HI>Animal Oeconomy.</HI> The <HI>Arteria Splenica</HI> is not only very large in Proportion to the Magnitude of the Spleen, but has a Remarkable Tortuous Passage to it, (<HI>Tab.</HI> 36. <HI>F.</HI> 1.) whence we may conceive as the Quantity of Blood sent to the Spleen is very great, so its <HI>Impetus</HI> is very much Abated: Next the Communications between the Ex|tremities of its Arteries and Veins are very Large, as ap|pears by the Prompt Exit, which Water pour'd into one Finds by the other, and the Inflation of the Veins which is easily made by Blowing into the Arteries, when the whole Spleen and its Veins become Distended with it. The Lym|phe-ducts of the Spleen we have Observ'd, (<HI>Tab.</HI> 36. <HI>Fig.</HI> 1.) to Arise from the <HI>Vesiculae</HI> at the Extremities of its Veins, and Discharge their Contents into the Neighbouring Lym|phatick Glands, whence it is sent into the <HI>Receptacule</HI> of the Chyle: Its Nerves are Distributed thro' its whole Sub|stance, and serve to preserve its Tone and Regulate the Separation of its <HI>Lympha</HI> and Nutritive Juice. But the most exact Scrutiny of <HI>Anatomists</HI> could never yet Discover any Excretory-duct arising from this <HI>Viscus</HI>; and indeed the Patent Communication of its Vessels seems a convincing Proof, that no such Excretory-duct can Exist but must ap|pear very plain. Besides it seems Extravagant and Unbecom|ing the Wonderful Providence of Nature, to Separate any particular Juice in the Arteries here to be instantly Refunded into the Veins, and we can hardly conceive the Blood can suffer any Alteration, in a Place where the Transit from the one to the other, is so Ample.</P>
<P>After these Considerations Premis'd, if the Problem be Pro|pos'd, What can be the Design of the great Architect of our Bodies, in the Fabrication of so Large and Remarkable a Part, without any Fluid Secreted in it, besides its own Nutritive Juice and <HI>Lympha</HI>? I believe our <HI>Hypothesis</HI> will enable us to give a sufficient Reply to this seeming invincible Difficulty, with which Learned Men have exceedingly perplex'd them|selves. I conceive then the Spleen is Design'd by Nature, as
<PB REF="8">
a Diverticle to receive a large Proportion of Blood to be Refunded by its Veins into the <HI>Porta,</HI> and promote the Re|flux of the Blood Imported thither from the Stomach, Guts, <HI>Pancreas,</HI> Mesentery, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by whose slow Progress thro' the innumerable Glands of those Parts, it returns Thick and unfit for Motion: And this seems but Necessary that a new Quantity of Blood, charg'd with a Copious <HI>Serum,</HI> should be Infunded into this Refluent Liquor before it Arrives at the Liver, to dispose it to pass the Extremities of the <HI>Vena Cava,</HI> and add a fresh <HI>Impetus</HI> to its Languid Motion caus'd by its Long and Tortutous Progress. This I take to be the Use and Office of the Spleen, and seems to have all the Cir|cumstances the Laws of Mechanism require for this Purpose. The Novelty of which Opinion will (I hope) be no Preju|dice to its Reception in the Minds of Candid and Impartial Men.</P>
<P>Having thus Represented the Circulation; the Order of Nature leads us to Respiration, which serves in conveying the Blood from the Right to the Left Ventricle of the Heart, and Impregnates it with Parts proper for its further Elaborations.</P>
<P>Respiration or Breathing is a double Action, <HI>i. e.</HI> Inspi|ration or Receiving of Air into the Lungs; and Expiration or Expelling it again: The whole is done by means of Wide|ning and Straitning the Cavity of the <HI>Thorax,</HI> in which the Lungs are contain'd.</P>
<P>How the Cavity of the <HI>Thorax</HI> may be Enlarged and Con|tracted, we may easily conceive, if we consider the Order of its Bony <HI>Parietes,</HI> (<HI>Tab.</HI> 27, and 28.) and observe the Oblique Descending Position of the Ribs from the <HI>Vertebrae</HI> of the Back, with their Cartilaginous Connection to the <HI>Os Pectoris,</HI> and the Position and Action of the Diaphragm, as is ex|plained <HI>Tab.</HI> 52. whence it appears when the Ribs are drawn up, and the Superior Convex Surface of the Diaphragm de|prest towards a Plain, the Included Space must necessarily be Enlarged; and on the contrary very much Straitned when the Ribs are drawn down, and the Upper Surface of the Dia|phragm Convex towards the Lungs, as it is Represented in the last mention'd Table.</P>
<P>The Elevation and Depression of the Ribs is perform'd by the <HI>Proper</HI> and <HI>Common</HI> Muscles of the <HI>Thorax</HI>: The First have their Rise and Termination confined to the Parts Composing its <HI>Parietes</HI>: The Other, notwithstanding their Relation to other Parts, yet chiefly respect This: Of the <HI>Common</HI> Muscles some are <HI>Principal,</HI> immediately moving This, together with those Parts from which they are de|rived: Others are <HI>Auxiliary,</HI> which by moving the Con|tiguous Bodies, Contribute to the better performing the Grand Motion: Thus the Elevation of the Shoulder-Blades is required in violent Respirations, without which the <HI>Musculi Serrati</HI> (<HI>Tab.</HI> 20.) (which spring from the <HI>Scapulae</HI>) (<HI>Tab.</HI> 29. V. W.) could not Act; hence it happens that Re|spiration is Interrupted when the Arms are in Action, by reason the <HI>Scapulae</HI> at that time engage all their Muscles (espe|cially the <HI>Serrati T.</HI> 20.) to render them Stable; and the Extension of the <HI>Vertebrae</HI> of the Neck becomes necessary, to the end the <HI>Musculi Scaleni</HI> (<HI>Tab.</HI> 18. B B.) may Raise the Upper Ribs.</P>
<P>The <HI>Proper</HI> Muscles of the <HI>Thorax</HI> are the <HI>Intercostales Ex|terni</HI> and <HI>Interni,</HI> (<HI>Tab.</HI> 26. <HI>Fig.</HI> 1.) the <HI>Triangulares,</HI> (<HI>Tab.</HI> and <HI>Fig. ead.</HI>) the <HI>Serrati Superiores</HI> and <HI>Inferiores Postici, Tab.</HI> 28.</P>
<P>The <HI>Principal Common</HI> Muscles, are the <HI>Scaleni,</HI> (<HI>Tab.</HI> 18.) the <HI>Subclavii, Tab.</HI> 20. the <HI>Serrati Majores &amp; Minores Antici,</HI> (<HI>Tab. ead.</HI>) and the <HI>Sacrolumbales,</HI> (<HI>Tab.</HI> 29.)</P>
<P>The Auxiliary Muscles are such as Raise the <HI>Scapulae,</HI> and draw them Backwards, and those which Extend the whole Spine.</P>
<P>The Cavity of the <HI>Thorax</HI> being dilated in the manner above mention'd, the Ambient Air necessarily rushes thro' the <HI>Aspera Arteria</HI> and <HI>Bronchia,</HI> into the <HI>Vesiculae</HI> of the Lungs, whereby their whole Substance becomes Distended; and this we call Inspiration.</P>
<P>In Expiration, the Air contain'd in the <HI>Vesiculae</HI> of the Lungs, is Excluded; in this Action the Lungs are not meerly Passive as in the Former, but the Elasticity of the Ligaments of their <HI>Bronchia,</HI> draw their Small Cartilages over each other, and Conduce to the Expulsion of the Air contain'd in their <HI>Ve|siculae.</HI></P>
<P>This Alternate Diastole and Systole of the Lungs and <HI>Tho|rax,</HI> bears an Analogy to a Pair of Bellows, whose Two Boards being drawn from each other, the Ambient Air neces|sarily rushes in between them, and Fills the Internal Space enlarg'd by the Deduction of their Sides; which Air is again Expell'd from thence, by Approaching them towards each other.</P>
<P>The Inducements the Author of <HI>Nature</HI> had to Frame this Pulmonary Organ, are many; by this the Aerial Parti|cles pass to the Mass of Blood, which Rarifie, Subtilize and render it fit for those Elaborations it afterwards undergoes: By these the Tenacious <HI>Serum</HI> of the Blood is Attenuated, and the whole Mass rendred fit for Motion; the Effects of which are Evident in those Rhumatick <HI>Asthmas</HI> and other Cases, which Oblige some to leave this Town for a Clearer Air.</P>
<P>The Lungs are the Intermediate Passage between the Two Ventricles of the Heart, whereby the whole Mass of Blood passes thro' their Large Blood-Vessels in an equal Rapidity and Quantity, with that of all other Parts of the Body be|sides, and do by this means discharge the Blood of a great Quantity of its <HI>Serum,</HI> by <HI>Halitus</HI> in Expiration; wherefore the Accurate Dr. <HI>Tyson</HI> Reckons them among the Num|ber of Glands.</P>
<P>This Alternate Action in which Respiration consists, is Ne|cessary, to the End the Blood may pass the Lungs, whose <HI>Ve|siculae,</HI> if they were constantly Distended by the Inspired Air, the Extremities of the Pulmonick Blood-Vessels would be Comprest; and on the contrary, if these <HI>Vesiculae</HI> were Col|laps'd (as after Expiration) their Blood-Vessels would be con|sequently Corrugated; but by this Vicissitude they become Permeable, and the Blood easily passes their Extremities.</P>
<P>We have Traced the Aliment from its First Reception till it is Elaborated into Blood, and pursued in its Motion and Circulation thro' its several Channels. We ought next to take a View of the several Liquors or Fluids separated from it in its <HI>Tour.</HI> All Animal Juices except the <HI>Chyle</HI> are separated from the Arterial Blood, which common Material in its Per|colation in the Brain and Nerves, yield the Contents of their Fibres; in the Glands of the Mouth and Throat, the <HI>Saliva</HI>; in the <HI>Mammae,</HI> the Milk; in the Kidneys, the Urine; in the <HI>Testes,</HI> Sperm; (not to name the Sweat, Mucilage of the Joints, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) and thro' the Universal Body, a Copious Quantity of <HI>Lympha</HI>; which is not applied to any distinct Use in the <HI>Animal Oeconomy,</HI> but is all discharg'd into the Great Cystern or Re|ceptacle of the <HI>Chyle</HI> and Subclavian Vein, and so Refunded into the Refluent Blood.</P>
<P>The Doctrine of Secretions is the last and only remaining Part of those Natural Functions, which are directed to the Preservation and Subsisting of the Individual. For the Na|ture and Properties of these Liquors, their Use and Office, and the peculiar Structure adapted for the Percolation of one, and excluding the rest; we must remit the Reader to the De|scription of the Organs themselves, contenting our selves here with the Theory of the Origin of the <HI>Lympha,</HI> and Se|cretion in General.</P>
<P>The Knowledge of this Animal-liquor call'd <HI>Lympha,</HI> and the Ducts which Convey it, is owing to the Industry and Searches of this present Age. But whether <HI>Rudbeck, Bartholine</HI> or our Countrey-man Dr. <HI>Iolive</HI> ought to carry the Honour of the Discovery, I shall not pretend to decide. But the Rise, Course, and other particular Circumstances needful to inform us of their Use, and the Design of Nature in the Fa|brication of these Ducts, has not been hitherto, at least fully, Demonstrated. Some have pretended to derive these Ducts from the Nerves, others from the Membranes or Tendinous Parts of the Muscles; but these are Impertinencies scarce worth a serious Refutation.</P>
<P>The diligent <HI>Melpighius</HI> in his Epistle to the <HI>Royal-Soc&iacute;ety,</HI> is follicitous in enquiring whether they are not Excretory-ducts to Export the Juice Secreted in the Conglobate Glands, since there is none of these Glands so inconsiderable to be found which has not its Lymphe-ducts belonging to it, as well as its Nerves and Blood-Vessels. After several Observa|tions premis'd, he concludes they Arise in exceeding Minute, and scarce perceptible <HI>Sirculi,</HI> from the Lesser Glands, which afterwards are United to those Arising from other Glands, forming Greater Trunks, and so proceed till they Empty themselves into the Common Cystern of the <HI>Chyle.</HI> I shall not repeat the Reasons or Experiments of that Curious Gentle|man to sustain his Opinion, which mainly amounts to this, That in pursuing these Ducts, we cannot by the most exact Scrutiny, or any Art yet known, Trace them further. But we must crave leave to differ from him in this Point, and per|haps the Reasons we shall offer, will be sufficient to justifie our Dissent, and give a more clear and satisfactory Account of the First Source of this Fluid.</P>
<P>The Glands I must confess have a great Concern in prepa|ring the <HI>Lympha,</HI> insomuch that no Lymphe-duct can absolve its Course without Touching on them; and their Necessity ap|pears yet further, while we see other Lymphe-ducts, (when the main Trunk passes by,) yet emit several Lateral Branches which Insert themselves into these Glands, and after being remitted from thence, are rejoin'd to the Former Trunk (<HI>App. Fig.</HI> 14.) Besides these Lymphe-ducts which Enter the Glands, are frequently divided into several Branches; which make their Exit again divided, and after approaching each other, join into one Current, <HI>ib. Fig.</HI> 13. But however Im|portant the Glands may be, I think they are far enough from being their Source.</P>
<P>The Glands of the Mesentery have their Lacteals which Import, and others which Export the <HI>Chyle</HI> from them. We shall find the Case of these Vessels to be entirely Parallel; every Lymphatick Gland we have yet been able to Discover having both Species of Ducts, the one to Import, the other to Export the <HI>Lympha</HI> from them; whence it is probable the Lesser not differing from the Greater in Structure, but Magni|tude only, they serve to Transmit the <HI>Lympha,</HI> and not give it its First Rise: This will be still more evident, if we
<PB REF="8">
consider the Great Communication between the Blood-Vessels and these Ducts.</P>
<P>The First Origination and Extremities of these Lymphe-ducts, are too Subtile and Fine to be discern'd by the Eye, even Assisted by the Microscope, and must give Room for Suspi|tion and Conjecture. The Arteries and Veins, we have above Demonstrated, are but one continuous Reflected Tube: For the Truth of this Assertion, in the Transparent Parts of Ani|mals (<HI>App. Fig.</HI> 4, 5.) we have the Evidence of our Senses; and that the same Continuity is kept thro' the whole System of the Body, no Rational Man who will please to Reflect on the Uniformity of Nature, can with any Pretence of Reason doubt. Now as these Vessels Communicate with each other, and admit a Prompt Passage of Air, Tincted Liquors, Mercu|ry, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from each to other, so by some Experiments we find they have with the Excretory-ducts, and <HI>Vice-versa,</HI> those Li|quors which we can convey into the Excretory-ducts after Death, will pass from them into the Blood-Vessels and Lym|phe-ducts, which Experiment I have remark'd (<HI>Tab.</HI> 43. <HI>Fig.</HI> 5.) as an Objection to those who suppose Valves in the begin|ning of the Excretory-ducts.</P>
<P>From these Demonstrative and Convincing Experiments, we may conceive the true Origin of the Lymphe-ducts, is from the Extremities of the Blood-Vessels; and their Office to carry Back the superfluous <HI>Serum,</HI> which is more Copious in the Ar|teries, than is perhaps convenient in the Veins, where the Pro|gress of the Blood is Slower, and the Quantity much greater. This Rise of the <HI>Lympha</HI> is still more clear,* if we consider in some States or Habits of Body, when the <HI>Crasis</HI> of the Blood is deprav'd, some Parts of it pass this way, and the <HI>Lympha</HI> is Ting'd by it; as it happens by Injecting Water by the Arteries after Death, when Part of the Blood still remains in its Vessels, you will see the Lymphe-ducts fill'd with a Bloody Water.</P>
<P>This Origination of the Lymphe-ducts from the Extremi|ties of the Blood-Vessels, we don't take to be altogether im|mediately from their Sides, as we do that of the Secretory Tubes, (<HI>App. Fig.</HI> 7.) but that they have a Double Origin, the one from the Extremities of the Arteries, and the other from the Cells or Tubes which contain the Nourishment of the Parts they Arise from: By this means not only the super|abundant <HI>Serum</HI> of the Blood in the Arteries, is carried off before it Arrives in the Veins, but the superfluous Nutritive Juice also, is return'd with the <HI>Lympha.</HI></P>
<P>In those Parts where we find the Passage of the Blood be|tween the Arteries and Veins very Patent, as in the Spleen and <HI>Penis,</HI> the Lymphe-ducts Arise from their <HI>Vesiculae</HI>; as has been Observ'd in the Former by the Accurate <HI>Nuck,</HI> and by my self in the Latter.</P>
<P>The like Origin of these Ducts may be Observ'd from the Spermatick Veins of the <HI>Testes</HI> and <HI>Ovaria,</HI> in which the Blood returns very little Divested of its Serosity, to the end its Globular Parts may the better Ascend in those Veins, with a Less Proportion of <HI>Serum.</HI></P>
<P>These Ducts Empty themselves into the <HI>Vesiculae</HI> of their Glands, as is Represented (<HI>App. Fig.</HI> 13, 14.) from whence the Exporting Ducts Arise, and carry the <HI>Lympha</HI> on to the next Gland or Thoracick-duct, (<HI>App. Fig.</HI> 11.) and so to the Subclavian Vein. Thus we find the Motion of the <HI>Lym|pha, Chyle</HI> and Nutritive Juice, is propell'd by means of the Systole of the Heart, by which all the Secretions of the Ani|mal Fluids, are in like Manner carried on.</P>
<P>In the Seventh Figure of our <HI>Appendix</HI> we have Exprest the Secretory Tubes Arising from the Venous, as well as the Ar|terious Part of the Sanguineous Channel before its Inflection; because we find there is a Transit from the Veins into these Vessels; yet in my Opinion most of them Arise from the Artery, where it Commences to grow Conical, where the Sides of the Vessel thro' the Efforts made by the Parts of the Blood propell'd, receive a more direct Pressure than in their Cylindrical Extremities, and the Particles Adapted to their Pores, are driven into the Tubes deriv'd from them.</P>
<P>By this Scheme, the Origin of the <HI>Lympha,</HI> and the Man|ner of Secretion, is well enough Explain'd. But why the <HI>Sa|liva</HI> is separated in the Parotid Maxillary and Sublingual Glands, the Bile in those of the Liver, the Urine by the Kid|neys, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> must be deduc'd from their peculiar Structure; the Magnitude, Figure of their Pores, and Various Disposi|tion of their Arteries, having a mighty share in these Opera|tions. Thus we may Observe the Arteries of the <HI>Testes,</HI> have a long and Flexuous Progress, and contrary to the ordinary Method of Nature, are smaller at their Origina|tions from the <HI>Aorta,</HI> than in their Trunks after a farther Descent, as we have Noted (<HI>Tab.</HI> 45.) all which conduce to abate the <HI>Impetus</HI> of the Blood, before it Arrives in the <HI>Testes.</HI> On the other Hand the Current of the Blood to the Kidneys, (by the Largeness, Short and Streight Course of the Emulgents, and their Vicinity to the Left Ventri|cle of the Heart,) is very Rapid, which discharges a great Quantity of Urine, soon after the Use of Chalybeat Wa|ters, or other plentiful Drinking, whilst it is infinite|ly more slow in the Salival Glands, <HI>Pancreas,</HI> Liver, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> We shall not here recite any further Particulars, hoping the Reader will peruse our Tables and Discourse of the seve|ral Organs.</P>
<P>Having done with our Doctrine of the First Order of Natu|ral Functions, we proceed to the Second, or those which serve for the Propagation of the Species; which Naturally divides its self into Two Parts, (<HI>viz.</HI>) Generation, and Accretion, or what concerns the <HI>Foetus</HI> in its Formation, and by what means and steps it's carried on to an Adult State. Since Animal Bodies are Transient and Temporary, the Author of Nature has endued them with the Power of Propagation, and a Set of Proper Organs to continue their <HI>Species,</HI> and furnish a constant Supply of new Individuals. From the Difference of which Organs of Generation Arises the difference of Sexes.</P>
<P>All Animals have been Divided into Viviparous and Ovi|parous, till Dr. <HI>Harvey</HI> remov'd the Distinction, by Demon|strating all Living Creatures to derive their Original from Eggs, with this Difference only; in one the <HI>Foetus</HI> is perfected within, and in the other without the Mothers Body. This Doctrine of that great Man has since been fully evinc'd by the repeated Dissections, Observations, and Experiments of Later <HI>Anatomists</HI>: No <HI>Species</HI> of Fowls, Fishes and Quadru|pedes are found to want them: The <HI>Foetus</HI> being sometimes found in the passage between the <HI>Ovarium</HI> and <HI>Vterus,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad the <HI>Alveoli</HI> deserted by them, are sufficiently discernable in all <HI>Animals</HI> after Impregnation; so that the Existence of These cannot be doubted, or that there is a perfect Confor|mity between the <HI>Pullus in Ovo,</HI> and the <HI>Foetus</HI> in the Womb. But here we must distinguish the Essential and Constituent Parts, from those which are only Alimentary and Accessory. It is the <HI>Cicatricula</HI> alone in the Eggs of Fowls, in which re|side the Rudiments of the <HI>Foetus,</HI> whilst the <HI>Vitellus</HI> and <HI>Al|bumen</HI> prepare and supply its Nourishment; both bearing an exact Analogy to the <HI>Lobes</HI> and <HI>Plantula Seminalis</HI> in Vegeta|ble Seeds. The Seminal <HI>Vesicula</HI> or <HI>Ovum</HI> found in the <HI>Testes</HI> of Women, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> agrees in every respect with the <HI>Cicatricula,</HI> and the other Parts are unnecessary, because the <HI>Foetus</HI> is nourish'd by Aliment supplied from the Mothers Body. Since the Dis|covery of these Eggs, the Ancient Doctrine that the <HI>Foetus</HI> was Form'd from the Commistion of the Male and Female Seed, has been by all Rejected, and that Liquour which has been taken by all preceding Ages for Seed in the Latter, is found to be only a Mucous Matter, Secreted from the Glands of the <HI>Vagina,</HI> (<HI>Tab.</HI> 51. <HI>F.</HI> 3. C.) and discharg'd without the Body; which in Mares, Cows, and many other <HI>Animals</HI> is in much greater Quantity, than is possible to be contain'd in their <HI>Testes.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' Generation <HI>ex Ovo</HI> may be justly reputed among the Modern Improvements of Anatomy, yet this did not altoge|ther escape the Notice of the Sagacious <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> who in his Book <HI>De Natura Pueri,</HI> informs us, the <HI>Embryo</HI> after Conception is Included in a Membrane, exactly resembling an Egg without its Shell, and describes the Rudiments of the <HI>Vmbilicus</HI> and <HI>Placenta,</HI> with its <HI>Plexus</HI> of Blood-Vessels, and the Pellucid Liquor of the <HI>Amnios</HI> after the same Manner as Represented (<HI>Tab.</HI> 57. <HI>Fig.</HI> 2.) This Accurate Observation, he acquaints us he made from an Abortion artificially pro|cur'd within Six Days after Conception, to preserve the Reputation of an Incontinent Wench; which remarkable Passage (not ordinarily taken Notice of) was shewn me by my very Ingenious Friend Dr. <HI>Fern.</HI> Much of the same Age or something more, and agreeing with the Description of <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> are the Secundines which the Learned Dr. <HI>Hannes</HI> keeps among his other Anatomical Collections.</P>
<P>Upon the Invention of these <HI>Ova, De Graaf</HI> and Others, who have successfully employ'd themselves in their Enquiries on this Subject, began to Erect an Opinion, That the Fe|male only furnish'd the Matter of the <HI>Foetus,</HI> and the Male serv'd to Actuate it by its Prolifick Influence. This Opinion, which derogates much from the Dignity of the Male-Sex, prevail'd till <HI>Mons. Leeuwenhoeck</HI> by the Help of his Exquisite Microscope, in which he has been well pursued by Mr. <HI>Melling,</HI> detected Innumerable small <HI>Animals</HI> in the Masculine Sperm, and by this Noble Discovery, at once remov'd that Difficulty, and added much to the Theory of Generation: In his Let|ter to the <HI>Royal-Society,</HI> he Acquaints them he had observ'd Incredible Numbers of these <HI>Animalcula</HI> in the Testicles of Froggs, so slender, as not to exceed the Thousandth Part of a single Hair, with a Head proportionably larger than the rest of their Body, all Variously moving to and fro; That he had found the same in the Testicles of all <HI>Animals,</HI> which he had Inspected; and in another, he gives them an Account, That in the Spawn of a <HI>Cabeliaw</HI> he had found them to be still Lesser, and more than Ten Thousand Swimming about in a Portion of Seed, not exceeding a Grain of Sand; and pre|tending to find by a Formal Computation all the <HI>Animals</HI> contain'd in the <HI>Lactes</HI> of this Fish, to exceed more than Ten times the Number of Men on the Surface of the Earth. Foe|cundation he esteems to proceed from one of these Nume|rous <HI>Animalcula,</HI> after Ejection, striking thro' the Pores or Perforations on the Sides of the <HI>Ovum,</HI> and Lodging it self in the <HI>Cicatricula,</HI> which is dispos'd to Receive and Nourish it.</P>
<P>From this surprizing Discovery, it is evident That
<PB REF="9">
no <HI>Aura Seminalis,</HI> or Influx of Active Spirituous Mat|ter do's Delineate the <HI>Foetus</HI>; and that Observation of <HI>Malpighius</HI> Illustrated, That before Impregnation, no <HI>Vesti|gia</HI> of the <HI>Pullus</HI> could be found, and yet in some few Hours after, it is distinct and visible. Having thus taken a short Prospect of the Materials, we must proceed to the Or|der and Progress of Generation, from the Inchoation, till the Perfection of the <HI>Foetus</HI> in the Womb, and its Exclusion, and thence till its full Growth, or Dimensions prescrib'd by Nature to the Species.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arteriae Spermaticae</HI> in Men bring the Blood to the <HI>Te|stes,</HI> in whose Convolutions, it is Prepar'd and carry'd by the <HI>Vasa Deferentia</HI> to the <HI>Vesiculae Seminales,</HI> where it is Lodg'd till in the Time of Coition, it is Injected into the <HI>Vagina Vteri.</HI> The Manner of the Erection of the <HI>Penis</HI> in applying it to the Transverse Ligament of the <HI>Ossa Pu|bis,</HI> by the <HI>Musculi Erigentes</HI> and the Constriction of the <HI>Cor|pus Cavernosum Vrethrae,</HI> by the <HI>Musculi Acceleratores,</HI> to Stop the Refluent Blood, and Inflate the Bulb and Cavernous Bodies, I shall wave Repeating, having amply Describ'd this Artifice, in the <HI>Appendix</HI> to my <HI>Myotomia Reformata.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Semen</HI> Injected into the <HI>Vagina</HI> of the Woman, is Con|vey'd to the <HI>Ovaria,</HI> thro' the Womb it self and the Fallop|pian Tubes; which, in the Time of Coition, by means of their Reticular Structure, are Inflated and strictly Em|brace them. We have Describ'd the Manner how the Fo|liated Expansions of the Left Falloppian Tube, Embrace the <HI>Ovarium</HI> on that Side, and are Distended by the Refluent Blood from the <HI>Vagina,</HI> whose Veins being Comprest by the <HI>Penis</HI> in Coition, all, or the greatest Part of its Blood, passes up by the Spermatick Veins, (which Inosculate with the Hy|pogastrick) and the Distended Tubes are Incurvated by the Broad Ligaments of the <HI>Vterus,</HI> and the <HI>Fundus Vteri</HI> being Distended also, and at the same Time the External Air Pent out by the <HI>Penis,</HI> a free Passage is left for the <HI>Se|men</HI> to the <HI>Ovarium.</HI> This I prefer as a more Compen|dious way of Conveying it, than either thro' the whole Mass of Blood, which must in my Opinion too much alter it, or thro' the Porous Substance of the <HI>Vterus,</HI> as others would have us believe. Nor can I conceive why any Man should scruple to think these small Animals may pass some Pore in the External Membranes, as they do in Froggs, Fish, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> where the <HI>Ovula</HI> are ejected out of the Female, before they are Impregnated by the Male, rather than suppose they should pass by the Spermatick Arteries to the <HI>Ovarium,</HI> after se|veral <HI>Circulations</HI> thro' the whole System of the Body. The immediate and direct Passage of the <HI>Semen</HI> is very much confirm'd, by comparing the Appearances of these Uterine Parts in Fowl, especially Hens.</P>
<P>One, or sometimes more of these <HI>Ova</HI> happening to be Foe|cundated at a Time, are distended and break the <HI>Pedunculi,</HI> by which they are affix'd, and leaving their <HI>Folliculi,</HI> pass into the Falloppian Tube, which resembling the Ovi-ducts in Birds, re|ceive and convey them to the <HI>Fundus Vteri.</HI> The manner how they are carry'd on is not less Mechanical, than most other Operations in the <HI>Animal Oeconomy</HI>; for as the Tur|gescence of the <HI>Penis</HI> first remits in its Extremity, so do's this exactly after the same manner, and by Consequence drives the <HI>Ovum</HI> contain'd in it to the <HI>Fundus</HI> of the Womb.</P>
<P>After the <HI>Ovum</HI> is arriv'd here, it Fluctuates about some Time without being fix'd, and receives Nourishment by Ap|position only, till at length some of its Vessels begin to Ger|minate, and afterwards Inosculate with those of the <HI>Vterus.</HI> The Arteries of the <HI>Ovum</HI> protruding themselves into the Veins of the <HI>Vterus,</HI> and the Veins <HI>Vice-versa</HI> into the Arte|ries, from which mutual Intertexture of the Vessels, the <HI>Pla|centa</HI> is compos'd.</P>
<P>By Intervention of the <HI>Placenta</HI> and Umbilical Vessels, the <HI>Foetus</HI> receives Blood from the Mother, and a common Circulation is continu'd, the Particulars of which, and the Difference of its Course from the Circulation after the Birth, is Describ'd in the Explication of the following Tables.</P>
<P>The Aliment for Nutrition of the <HI>Foetus,</HI> seems to be a sort of Chylous Juice separated by the Glands of the <HI>Pla|centa,</HI> and reposited in the Capacity of the <HI>Amnios</HI> (<HI>Tab.</HI> 55, 58.) which Grows considerable for its Quantity in the Se|cond and Third Month, and the <HI>Foetus</HI> begins to take it in at its Mouth, for some time before its Birth, whence it is con|vey'd to the Stomach and Intestines, and Part passes into Chyle and Blood-Vessels, according to the Ordinary Method of Nature in an Adult; the remainder Composing the Ex|crement we find in the Intestines of the <HI>Foetus,</HI> and some|times Floating in the Liquor of the <HI>Amnios.</HI> Besides which, the <HI>Mammill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> of Recent-born Infants of both Sexes, con|tain a Serous Milky Liquor, which is discharg'd into the Li|quor of the <HI>Amnios.</HI></P>
<P>After the <HI>Foetus</HI> has lain Nine Months in the Womb, it Arrives at such a Magnitude as makes it uneasie both for want of Room and Aliment. Besides the Excrements voi|ded from its <HI>Anus</HI> foul the Contents of the <HI>Amnios,</HI> and mo|lest the <HI>Foetus,</HI> which by its frequent and strenuous Strug|lings, shakes the <HI>Placenta,</HI> and breaks the slender Vessels, which Connect it to the <HI>Vterus</HI>; from the Conspiring of which Circumstances, Parturition must necessarily follow.</P>
<P>After the Secundines are remov'd, and the Infant first Opens its Mouth, the Ambient Air rushes into the Lungs, and Di|stends the <HI>Vesiculae Aereoe,</HI> which afterwards remain in some measure Inflated, because the Extremity of the <HI>Bronchia</HI> which Open into them, are much Less than the <HI>Vesiculae</HI> themselves, and some Part of the Air will still continue in them; whence they Gain a greater Specifick Lightness, and Swim in Water. The Pulmonick Blood-Vessels which before the Birth lay Collaps'd, have their Trunks and Ramifications Extended, and admit the Blood to pass thro' them; the <HI>Foramen Ova|le,</HI> and <HI>Canalis Arteriosus</HI> not lying in a Direct Line to the Propulsion of the Blood; these Passages in Tract of Time, become Obliterated, and all the Blood from the Right Ven|tricle of the Heart, passes thro' the Lungs, before it can Ar|rive at the Left. These Alterations of the <HI>Oeconomy</HI> happen af|ter the <HI>Foetus</HI> is brought into the World, and Expos'd to the External Air.</P>
<P>Having seen how the Infant is Generated and Usher'd into the World, with the Alterations which attend its Birth, we must consider next by what means Nutrition and Accretion are Effected, or the Steps by which it proceeds insensibly from such small Beginnings, to its due Size and Dimensions. It is certain, that the Bodies of <HI>Animals</HI> are nothing else than a Vascular Compages, and all their Parts Exist in the Foecun|dated <HI>Ovum,</HI> which by the Accession of New Matter, are only Distended and become Visible. From which Consideration we may infer, That the Augmentation of the Body is made by a Simple Extension of all the Tubes, Vessels and Cells; which when they will no longer recede to admit the Nutri|tious Particles, to be Lodg'd in the Interstices of the Fibres which Compose their Parietes, and there remain no more <HI>Ostiola</HI> in the Sides of their Vessels, by which the Fluids can Open a Passage, the Body is Arriv'd at the utmost limits of its Growth. This Tenseness and Contiguity of the Fibres which refuses to admit more of the Nutritious Parts, is that which Determines the Magnitude of <HI>Animals,</HI> and the same Hypothesis will serve to Explicate the differing Sizes of Individuals of the same Species. In this Manner the Bones Arrive at their full Dimensions, and then preserve their Sta|bility and Figure, whose Accretion and other Accidents Ari|sing from its Vitiation, are very well Explain'd by Dr. <HI>Havers</HI> in his <HI>Osteologia.</HI> But besides the gradual Increase and For|mation of the Tubes and Vessels, there is a necessity for a Supply of Fluids to maintain a Plenitude, with a constant Reparation of the Blood and Humours to prevent the Col|lapse: Thus in an <HI>Atrophy,</HI> the great Emaciation and appa|rent Loss of the Substance, proceeds from a want of Proper Fluids to preserve the Arteries, Veins, Lymphe-ducts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and other Channels of the Body in their due Distention. I must confess a Corrosive Salt in some deprav'd Crases of the Blood, may consume the Stable and Organick Parts, as in the <HI>Spina Ventosa,</HI> and such like Cases, where the Bones some|times (as I have seen in one of the Fingers) are wholly Dis|solv'd, while the External Teguments have not been injur'd; but in this Case, contrary to the other, the Loss is Irreparable. Hence Appears the necessary Distinction between Accretion and Nutrition, the First being an Accession to the Organical Parts, by New Matter Intruding into the Interstices of their Fibres, and there remaining; and the Latter only a Supply of a Proper <HI>Pabulum</HI> to the Fluids, to preserve them in a due Temper and Proportion. The First being fix'd and perma|nent, and scarce alter'd once in the Term of a Man's Life, and the Last in a perpetual Succession and Flux; which there|fore requires the superfluous Part of the <HI>Succus Nutritius,</HI> not retain'd in the Proper Tubes and Cells to be Infunded into the Lymphe-ducts, by which it is again return'd to the General Mass; the Manner of which we may Conceive by <HI>Fig.</HI> 6. of the <HI>Appendix.</HI></P>
<P>From the <HI>Natural,</HI> we pass to the <HI>Animal</HI> Functions: That the Brain and Nervous System are the Common <HI>Medium</HI> of Sense and Motion is uncontested; but the manner how the Impressions are convey'd from the External Organs to the <HI>Sedes Animae,</HI> and <HI>Vice-versa</HI> from thence to the Organ, and how a Material Substance can affect and be affected by an Immaterial, is Obscure and scarce to be conceiv'd. Where|fore waving all Precarious Hypotheses, I shall confine my self to the Description of such <HI>Phaenomena</HI> as are Matters of Fact, and undeniable, and leave the Reader at Liberty to erect what System he pleases. The Seat of Sense is the Brain, whose Nervous Dispensations are the Intermediate Bodies between it and the Organs, on which the External Objects act. When the Impression is made by the Object, and receiv'd into the Organ of Sense, it is convey'd from thence with the same Type or Character, by an Agitation of its Nervous Expansions and their continued Trunks, to the common Sensory: This is common to Men and Brutes, and is by <HI>Des Cartes</HI> made the First Degree of Sensation: The Second is the Perception of the Soul attending that Mo|tion, which immediately follows the former Degree, by rea|son of the intimate Connexion of the Soul to the <HI>Sensorium Commune.</HI> The Third comprehends all those Judgments which we form by the Occasion of those Motions: Hence
<PB REF="9">
it follows, all Corporeal Objects are only Perceivable by us, in as much as they affect the Nerves expanded, in such and such Organs. This is the general Idea of Sensation so far as can be explain'd without Engaging in particular Schemes.</P>
<P>Before we enter on the Consideration of the External Senses, we shall offer a short Account of the Structure of the Brain and Nerves in general. The <HI>Cerebrum,</HI> (Tab. 10. Fig. 1.) <HI>Cerebellum</HI> and <HI>Medulla Spinalis</HI> (Tab. and Fig. ib.) are evidently compos'd of Two Parts: the first which appears on the Surface of the <HI>Cerebrum</HI> and <HI>Cerebellum</HI> is of a Cineritious Colour, and is call'd the Cortical and Glandulous Part; the other or internal is Whiter and Harder, and is call'd the Medullary, Callose, and Fibrous Part: This Order is inverted in the Spinal Marrow, where the External Part is Callose and White, and it's Internal, Soft and Cineritious. The Ci|neritious or Cortical Part of the <HI>Cerebrum</HI> is remarkable in those Turnings and Windings which are deeply divided by the <HI>Pia Mater</HI> within the Body of the <HI>Cerebrum</HI> (<HI>Tab.</HI> 10. <HI>Fig.</HI> 1. C.) from whence it appears to have a very large Surface. The like Contrivance is observable in the <HI>Cere|bellum</HI>; the outward Appearance of the <HI>Sulci</HI> of which differ from those of the <HI>Cerebrum,</HI> and are ranged in Parallel Lines according to its Length, as exprest <HI>Tab.</HI> 7. <HI>Fig.</HI> 2. Besides the Cineritious Part of the <HI>Cerebrum</HI> plac'd on its Surface, it has still other Cineritious Bodies or Protuberances added to its <HI>Corpus Callosum</HI>; as the <HI>Corpora Striata,</HI> (App. Fig. 30. &Dgr;&Dgr;.) <HI>Na|tes</HI> and <HI>Testes.</HI> (Tab. 10. Fig. 1.)</P>
<P>In a Horizontal Section of the <HI>Cerebrum,</HI> its Cortical and Me|dullary Parts Appear, as Represented <HI>App. Fig.</HI> 30. In a Trans|verse Section of the <HI>Cerebellum,</HI> an Arboreous Disposition of the Latter Appear within the Former (<HI>Tab.</HI> 10. <HI>Fig.</HI> 1.) The Cineritious Colour of the Cortical Parts of the Brain Arises from the Number and Contortion of its Proper Blood-Ves|sels, which Pass according to the Length of the Fibres in the Callose and White Part.</P>
<P>In Viewing the Surface of the Cortical Parts, it Appears Compos'd of a vast Number of small Glands of a Deprest Oval Figure, from each of which Spring the Medullary Fi|bres, which Compose the Callose or White Part; all which make the <HI>Centrum Ovale</HI> of <HI>Vieussens</HI> (App. Fig. 30. n n.) be|fore they Compose the <HI>Crura Medullae Oblongatae,</HI> (<HI>App. Fig.</HI> 29. B B.) In this Progress, the Medullary Fibres of the <HI>Ce|rebrum,</HI> give Originals to the Olfactory and Optick Nerves: At the Conjunction of the <HI>Crura,</HI> the Third Pair of Nerves Arise, <HI>App. Fig.</HI> 28, 3, 33: soon after the Annular Process or <HI>Pons Varolii,</HI> (which partly Arisies from the <HI>Cerebellum</HI>) (<HI>App. Fig.</HI> 28. s s) is Join'd with the <HI>Crura.</HI> In this Part of the Conjunction of the Medullary Parts of the <HI>Cerebrum</HI> with the several Processes of the <HI>Cerebellum,</HI> the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Pair of Nerves Arise: and at the Beginning of the <HI>Medulla Oblongata,</HI> (whence Spring the Eighth and Ninth Pair of Nerves,) there is a compleat Union of all the Medullary Parts of the <HI>Cerebrum</HI> and <HI>Cerebellum</HI>; Where a Cineritious Part may be seen in its Middle, as Appears <HI>App. Fig.</HI> 29. d d. This Inversion of the Order of the Callose and Cineritious Parts, is kept thro' the whole <HI>Medulla Spinalis.</HI></P>
<P>From what has been above Observ'd, it Appears, the Sur|faces of the Cortical Parts of the <HI>Cerebrum</HI> and <HI>Cerebellum</HI> are much larger than those of their Medullary, consequently each Gland which helps to Compose them, must be larger in its Diameter than the Medullary Fibre, which Arises from it. This Consideration will lead us still farther; for since it's plain, the Surfaces of the Medullary Parts of the Brain and <HI>Cerebellum,</HI> are much larger than they are afterwards in the <HI>Medulla Oblongata,</HI> therefore the Fibres which Compose them, must necessarily be thicker in their Diameters, at each Gland, than they are afterwards in their Progress to the Beginnings of the Nerves, where they are considerably contracted, and frame the <HI>Apex</HI> of a Cone.</P>
<P>Here we must not omit to take notice, that all those Medullary Fibres inservient to Motion in general, and the Organs of Tasting and Touching, are very much Con|tracted at the Beginnings of their Nerves, without the Bo|dy of the Brain and <HI>Medulla Spinalis</HI>; and on the other hand, all those Medullary Fibres employ'd in the Organs of Seeing, Hearing and Smelling are contracted, or have the <HI>Apices</HI> of their Cones within the Body of the Brain: Thus the Nervous Fibres concern'd in Motion in general, and such as are Mov'd by the Contact of Gross Objects, are lessen'd between their Originals and several Divarications, <HI>extra Cerebrum</HI>; but those affected by the Mediation of Light and Air, within the Brain.</P>
<P>The utmost I could yet Observe in Viewing the Nervous <HI>Fibrillae</HI> with a Microscope (whether Composing the <HI>Corpus Callosum</HI> of the Brain, or the Bodies of the Nerves themselves) is, that they are Form'd of a Reticulated Compages of Fi|bres; which in the Latter Appear Globular; but in the For|mer or <HI>Corpus Callosum</HI> (by reason of the irregular Section, or Expanding a Thin Divided Transparent Part of it on the Ob|ject-Plate of the Microscope) it Appears Reticulated, and the Interstices of its <HI>Rete</HI> of various Angles. This Structure of the Nervous System, seems to Plead against those Hypotheses of the Animal Functions, Founded on the Motions of the Spirits or Fluids, Deriv'd immediately from the Brain, and Transmitted by the Nervous Channels. We shall here only present the Reader with an Anatomical Plan of the Organs of the External Senses, and shew how Objects may be Im|prest on them and Convey'd to the <HI>Sensorium Commune,</HI> and leave him to Contemplate on the Elegant Fabrick of the Brain, whose particular Contrivances have hitherto escap'd the Dis|covery of the most Sagacious Enquirers.</P>
<P>The Five External Senses, are so many differing Species of Perception from the Applications of Bodies to their several Organs; either Immediate, as in Feeling and Tasting; or thro' a Proper <HI>Medium,</HI> as in Smelling, Hearing and Seeing. The Sense of Feeling is Extended thro' the whole Body, except some few Parts, as the Bones, Cartilages, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but chiefly Re|sides in the True Skin, whose Structure, so far as it Relates to this Sense, is as follows. The <HI>Cuticula,</HI> (Tab. 4. Fig. 1, 2, 3.) (which is a common Covering to the whole Surface of the Skin) being Remov'd, certain Papillary Protuberances Dis|cover themselves, which View'd with a Microscope (<HI>Tab.</HI> 4. <HI>Fig.</HI> 6.) Appear made up of many Roundish Sudoriferous Glands, with a vast Number of Nervous <HI>Fibrillae</HI> Expanded on their Surface: This Uneven Papillary Surface is necessary, to the end those <HI>Fibrillae</HI> may be the more Expanded and Ap|ply'd to Tangible Objects; so that the Figure, Modification and other manifest Qualities may be Discern'd, and the Im|pressions Convey'd to the Common Sensory, by the Media|tion of their Nerves. Since the Extremities of the Fingers and Thumbs are (for many Reasons) necessary Parts to be En|dued with an Exquisite Sense of Feeling; therefore the Or|der of these <HI>Papillae</HI> are there Converted to a Contorted Series, which Appear like so many <HI>Rugae</HI> under the <HI>Cuticula,</HI> as is Represented in the last Mention'd Table, <HI>Fig.</HI> 4. The <HI>Cuticula</HI> here, as well as in other Parts of the Skin, is a ne|cessary <HI>Medium</HI> between the Object and the Organ; but when it Grows very Thick, as in some Laborious Mecha|nicks, it becomes an Impediment. From the vast Number of these Nervous Filaments, any Solution of Continuity of the Skin it self, is more Painful, than most of its subjacent Parts.</P>
<P>The Fabrication of the Tongue, its Papillary Surface, and the Manner of its Application to Objects, bears a great Simi|litude to that of the Skin now Describ'd, in so much that some have reckond the Sense of Tasting a <HI>Species</HI> of <HI>Tactus.</HI> The Structure of this Part, as well as its Coverings and Papilla|ry Bodies, are Represented <HI>Tab.</HI> 13. where <HI>Fig.</HI> 2. Shews the External Membrane, in which the Papillary Bodies lying un|der it, Appear variously Figur'd, some Conical, others Round, and others with their Extremities Forked. In some Animals these <HI>Papillae</HI> are externally Large, and their Extremities Cartilaginous and Horny, but in Humane Tongues it is far otherwise; the Outward Membrane here being very Soft, the <HI>Papillae</HI> Numerous and Small, and appearing Villous to the Na|ked Eye. This Membrane being Rais'd (after sufficient Boyl|ing the Tongue) the next which offers, is more Spongy, Softer and full of Blood-Vessels, <HI>Tab. ib. Fig.</HI> 6, 7. This is Perfo|rated by the many Nervous <HI>Papillae,</HI> immediately Plac'd un|der it: (<HI>Tab. ib. Fig.</HI> 8.) the Tops of which are afterwards Re|ceiv'd in the <HI>Vaginulae</HI> of the External Membrane. These <HI>Pa|pillae</HI> Cleave to the Fleshy Fibres of the Tongue, and are of various Sizes and Figures as above Noted. In the Inter|stices of these <HI>Papillae</HI> are Plac'd Divers Salival Glands, the Excretory Tubes of which, Discharge themselves by certain Apertures; (<HI>Tab. ib. Fig.</HI> 2. G G.) whereby the Villous Covering of the Tongue is Moisten'd, and the Saporiferous Particles are readily Admitted to the <HI>Corpora Papillaria,</HI> whose Nervous Expansions (on their Surface, like those of the <HI>Cutis</HI>) Transmit the several Impressions (made by Objects of Va|rious Figures) to the Common Sensory, by the Mediation of the <HI>Par Quintum.</HI> Thus the Structure of the External Parts of the Tongue, Agree with that of the Skin, with this Difference, the Former being Cloth'd (in Humane Bodies) with a very Thin Soft Membrane, and its <HI>Papillae</HI> very Nu|merous, Less and more Extruded or Longer; whereas the <HI>Papillae Cutis,</HI> are Larger, Shorter, and Cover'd with a more Dense Membrane or <HI>Cuticula.</HI> Hence the Tongue Appears to be an Exquisite Organ of <HI>Tactus.</HI> However the Sense of Taste principally Resides in the Tongue, yet we must Refer the Or|gans of Smelling hither, since Experience Shews us the For|mer Sense cannot be Compleat, where the Latter is Defi|cient.</P>
<P>The External Organ of Smelling is not Confin'd within the Cavities of the Nostrils, but is Compos'd of a very Large Glandulous Nervous Membrane, in like manner Extended within the Cavities of the <HI>Ossa Frontis</HI> (Tab. 89. Fig. 1. ib. Tab. 91. Fig. 2.) Fourth Pair of Bones of the Upper-Jaw, (<HI>Tab.</HI> 92. <HI>Fig.</HI> 1. E.) and in that Part of the <HI>Os Sphenoides</HI> composing the <HI>Sella Tur|cica,</HI> (Tab. 89. Fig. 2.) all which Open into the <HI>Foramina Na|rium.</HI> Besides these Cavities, the Nostrils are furnish'd with Divers <HI>Ossa Spongiosa,</HI> Describ'd, <HI>Tab.</HI> 92. <HI>Fig.</HI> 1. H. on which the same Membrane is Expanded. This Membrane is in a great Measure compos'd of the Extremities of the Olfactory Nerves, and is the Organ of this Sense, which receives the Impression made by the Odoriferous <HI>Effluvia,</HI> whether in Inspiration, as in the Proper Action of Smelling; or Expiration, as in Tasting, which happens in Mastication or Deglutition of the Aliment.
<PB REF="10">
What we have hinted concerning the Complication of Tast|ing with Smelling, will in some Manner be evinc'd, if we re|flect on that Common Practice of Holding the Nose to avoid Nauseous Tasts: And when the <HI>Foramina Narium</HI> are partly Obstructed, (as after taking Cold) how little we Distinguish the Proper Tasts of some Things, especially such as are Odoriferous.</P>
<P>The Organs of the Fourth External Sense, are the Two Ears, by which the Various Sounds Imprest on the Ambient Air, are Represented to the Common Sensory. The Exter|nal Ear or <HI>Auricula</HI> (Tab. 12. Fig. 1.) is Compos'd of a Car|tilage Cover'd with the <HI>Cuticula</HI> and <HI>Cutis</HI>; whose many Con|torted Foldings, are Fitted for the Reception of the External Undulating Air, and Transmitting it to the <HI>Meatus Audito|rius.</HI> The Winding Progress of the <HI>Meatus</HI> seems purposely contriv'd, to prevent some Inconveniences which might Arise, from the Violent Irruption of the Air thro' too Direct a Passage to the <HI>Membrana Tympani,</HI> plac'd at the farther End of it: (<HI>Ap. Fig.</HI> 15. e.) For the same Intent, the <HI>Cerumen</HI> or Ear-Wax, seems to be Separated by the Numerous Glands in the Membrane of the <HI>Meatus,</HI> to Infringe its Motion. The Air which thus Passes the <HI>Meatus,</HI> Shakes the <HI>Membrana Tympani</HI> more or less, according to the Various Impressions made on it <HI>ab Extra</HI>: The Long Process of the <HI>Malleus</HI> (App. Fig. 15.) which is Contiguous to this Membrane, is necessarily Mov'd, consequently the <HI>Incus</HI> which is Articulated with the <HI>Malleus,</HI> (App. Fig. 16. H, I.) and the <HI>Stapes,</HI> which is Articulated with the <HI>Incus,</HI> by the Mediation of the <HI>Os Orbiculare,</HI> (App. Fig. 17. H I.) are all successively Mov'd by each other: Nor could any Tremulous Motions be Imprest on the <HI>Membrana Tym|pani</HI> by the External Air, if the Cavity of the <HI>Tympanum</HI> it self had no Aperture, by which its Contain'd Air could Fluctuate, no more than a Drum it self would Sound if there were no Holes in its Sides. For this Reason a Passage from the Palate to the <HI>Tympanum</HI> is Form'd, (<HI>Vid. App. Fig.</HI> 8. N N.) By this Curious Artifice the Various Sounds Arising from the Vibrations of the External Air, are Modifi'd, and Ar|ticulately Represented to the Auditory Nerve, Expanded within the Winding Cavities of the <HI>Labyrinth</HI> or Three Se|micircular Ducts and <HI>Cochlea</HI> (App. Fig. 17, 18.) by means of the <HI>Stapes,</HI> whose <HI>Basis</HI> immediately Covers the <HI>Foramen Ova|le</HI> or Entrance to those Cavities, where the <HI>Aer Insitus</HI> or <HI>Con|genitus,</HI> is said to Reside. This Air tho' call'd <HI>Innate,</HI> must Arise from that Contain'd in the <HI>Tympanum,</HI> and necessarily has a Communication with it, else we cannot see how the Vibrations made by the <HI>Stapes,</HI> should be Communicated to these Contorted Channels. Nor can it be suppos'd, the <HI>Ba|sis</HI> of the <HI>Stapes</HI> has any loose Membranous Connexion to the Margin of the <HI>Foramen Ovale</HI> (which it must have, to keep out the Air Contain'd in the <HI>Tympanum</HI>;) Or that the <HI>Sta|pes</HI> adequately Closes that <HI>Foramen</HI>: Both which would meet with Equal Impediments from the Grosser Air in the <HI>Tym|panum,</HI> pressing on the <HI>Basis</HI> of the <HI>Stapes,</HI> and hindring its Elevation.</P>
<P>The Small Muscles which move the <HI>Malleus,</HI> and that of the <HI>Stapes,</HI> like the Heart, Diaphragm and Muscles concern'd in Respiration, do their Office Inadvertently, and are Useful herein, as we have Represented them in <HI>App. Fig.</HI> 15, 16, 17. This Structure of the <HI>Auricula</HI> and Parts within the <HI>Tym|panum,</HI> Prepare the Impressions made in the External Air, and Represent them to the Expansions of the Auditory Nerve; not unlike the Membranes and Humours of the Eye, Refracting the Rays of Light in passing to the <HI>Tunica Retina</HI> in the Eye, which falls next under our Consideration.</P>
<P>As the Air is the Vehicle of the Objects to the Two For|mer Organs, so the Light is to this. The Nature and Pro|perties of Light, the Magnitude, Figure or Motion of Lu|minous Particles, as well as the Shape or Conformation of those Parts, which Affect the Organs of the other Senses, we omit as more Proper for the Disputes of the Schools than an Anatomical Discourse, confining our Theory of Vision to the Structure of the Parts.</P>
<P>In the Fabrication of these Organs, the Eye-lids or <HI>Pal|pebrae</HI> (Tab. 11. Fig. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.) are none of the least Re|markable. The Upper is Elevated and Deprest by Two Muscles, the External of which is Circular and call'd <HI>Or|bicularis.</HI> (Tab. 12. Fig. 4.) This Draws the Upper Eye-lid down; the Internal is Straight (<HI>Tab.</HI> 11. <HI>Fig.</HI> 4.) and Pulls it up. By this Contrivance the Eye is not only Defended from Extraneous Bodies, but the Discharge of the Lachri|mal Humour is Accelerated by the several Ducts, into the Internal Part of the <HI>Palpebrae</HI> next the Bulb of the Eye, <HI>Vid. Tab.</HI> 11. <HI>Fig.</HI> 5. The Eye it self is Spherical and Mov'd by its Proper Muscles, Represented in the last mention'd <HI>Tab. Fig.</HI> 7, 8, 9, 10.

The Chrystalline Humour Receives the Rays First Infracted in the <HI>Cornea,</HI> and beginning to Diverge again in the Aqueous Humour, and Refracts them a Second Time; So that all the Rays proceeding from the same Point of the Object, by Pass|ing thro'. this Dense <HI>Medium,</HI> do Converge again, and Ter|minate in the same Point on the <HI>Retina.</HI> From this Refraction or Direction of the Rays of Light, to a Point, distinct Pictures or Images of Visible Objects are Represented on the <HI>Retina,</HI> as the Figures of External Bodies in passing thro' a Single Convex Glass on a Paper on the Wall of a dark Chamber, the whole will be better Conceiv'd by the following Figure, which Represents the same Section of the Eye, as the For|mer with the Luminous Rays passing thro'.</P>

<P>Thus the Rays in Passing thro' the <HI>Cornea</HI> and Humours of the Eyes, are Inverted, and the Image of the Object is so Depicted on the Concave of the <HI>Retina.</HI> How this Inver|sion is Reduc'd in the <HI>Sensorium Commune</HI> to a Right Per|ception, may be Accounted for in our Proper Knowledge of Things, in the same Manner, as we know when we hold a Stick in each Hand cross each other, that the Stick in the Right Touches such an Object, and that in the Left another: Thus Vision being made by the Rayes of Light proceeding from the Object, and making Due and Various Motions of the Nervous Fibres of the <HI>Retina,</HI> which are Com|municated to the Common Sensory by the Optick Nerves with the same Type and Character; we may reckon this Sensation to be not altogether unlike that of <HI>Tactus.</HI></P>
<P>The Last of the Animal Functions which we should here speak of, is Muscular Motion, but having already Publish'd my Thoughts conerning that <HI>Phaenomenon</HI> in my <HI>Myotomia Reformata,</HI> I shall not trouble the Reader here with a Repe|tition, since no Experiment, nor Observation (besides that mention'd in <HI>Tab.</HI> 64. <HI>Fig.</HI> 2. concerning the Fleshy Fibres) has since Occur'd, which should Add to those Conjectures, or Favour any other.</P>

<P>_THE Fate of Authors, when they appear on the Publick Stage of the World, is extreamly uncertain; Good or Ill Success, Reputation or 'Disgrace fre|quently depend more on the Humor and Prejudice of the <HI>Reader,</HI> than the Merit of the Performance. This hard Fortune of all Writers has made it Dangerous for any Book to venture Abroad, without some Ha|rangue or Apology before it, to bespeak a favourable Treatment. For my Part, I have no Excuse to offer for not Complying with this reasonable Cu|stom; but wholly resign my Cause to all Well-wishers, to the Advancement of <HI>Anatomy,</HI> the proper Iudges of this Matter; whose Candor and In|dulgence, I doubt not, will be a better Protection, from the Defects that shall be Discover'd in this Work, than any Reasons I shall be able to alledge in my Defence.</P>
<P>This Volume contains a General Description of the Fabrick of Humane Bodies, after the Manner of a Commentary on the Tables, which Represent their several Organs. The present and last Age, have been Industrious in making Discoveries in the <HI>Animal Machine,</HI> by Detecting the Structure of the Heart, and Artifice of the Circulation, the Origin and Course of the Lymphe-ducts, the se|veral Salival Glands and their Channels, the Texture of the Bones, and Medullary Cells, the Mu|cilaginous Glands of the Ioints, the Organs and Process of Generation, the Organs of the External Senses, in reforming the Myology, (an Essay on the Last of These, with some Remarks on the Stru|cture and Erection of the <HI>Penis,</HI> I some time since Publish'd,) all which the <HI>Reader</HI> will find in the following Descriptions, with my own Observations and Conjectures, which in many Places differ from the General receiv'd Opinions. Besides the History of the Natural Structure, I have thro' the whole <HI>Series</HI> of the Work, Inserted some <HI>Phaenomena,</HI> I have found in Dissecting Morbid Bodies, and such Practical Instructions, as I hope will be Useful in many Cases, to the Chirurgical Operator.</P>
<P>The whole is dispos'd in this Order: In the first Hundred and Five Tables, after a Prospect of the Body, with the Teguments, Hair, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Parts of the Head, Neck, Brain, <HI>Medulla Spinalis</HI> follow, and so proceeds to those of the Breast, Back, Loins, Lower-belly, <HI>Uterus</HI> with the <HI>Foetus</HI> and its Adjuncts; next the Muscles of the Limbs, and lastly the <HI>Osteology.</HI> These Figures were Drawn after the Life, by the Masterly Painter <HI>G. de Lairess,</HI> and Engrav'd by no less a Hand, and Represent the Parts of <HI>Humane Bodies</HI> far beyond any Exstant; and were some time since Publish'd by <HI>Dr. Bidloo,</HI> now <HI>Professor</HI> of <HI>Anatomy</HI> in the University of <HI>Leyden.</HI> I shall take the Li|berty here to acquaint the <HI>Reader,</HI> That in these Tables I have added above Seven-hundred Refe|rences, all which are Letter'd with a Pen in the several Figures; among which it is hardly possi|ble, but Mistakes may occur in some Places, (by those who have Inserted them) which I hope will not be imputed to my Inadvertence. The Parts which in many Places had their Nomenclature barely annex'd, are here Copiously Describ'd; to which, as I before Noted, are added such Observations of the Male Conformation and Vitiated Structure, as may Illustrate the <HI>Pathology</HI> or History of Diseases, their Symptoms and Causes; I have likewise interspers'd several Remarks on the usual Method of Chirurgical Operations, with Directions for performing them in a more Exact and Successful Man|ner; and lastly given an Account of several Cases and Accidents rarely occurring, and not (at least commonly) observ'd by Authors. The <HI>Appendix</HI> is partly a Supplement to the preceding Tables, and partly a Correction of such Things as are not well Exprest; for Instance, The two First Tables present a Prospect or General View of the whole Body, both on the Fore and Back-side, Denuded of its Teguments, and Clear'd from its Fat; where the External Muscles with their Ten|dons, <HI>Fasciculi</HI> and <HI>Series</HI> of Fibres, Appear on the Surface. These are not Drawn by Invention, but are Touch'd on after an Original Cast from the Life in <HI>Plaister of Paris,</HI> which I have now by me. The Third Table contains a System of the Arteries Dissected from a <HI>Foetus,</HI> with their several Trunks and Ramifications, Delineated from the Life, which I have also by me Injected with VVax; how much this differs from that Describ'd (<HI>Tab.</HI> 23.) may be soon Discover'd. In two other Fi|gures of the same Table, are the Prospects of the Extremities of the Veins and Arteries, as they Appear in the Transparent Finns of a Grigg and Flounder, view'd thro' a Microscope. Here the Method of Circulation, the Continuity of the Venous and Arterious Channels, the <HI>Globuli</HI> pas|sing them in an uninterrupted Current, is Demonstrated. In another Figure is Exprest our Con|jecture of the Rise of those Ducts, which Export the <HI>Lympha</HI> and redundant Nutriment. In the Fourth Table, the <HI>Receptaculum Chyli</HI> is Represented, Fill'd with Mercury, with the Various Course of the Chyle-Vessels and Lymphe-ducts, their Communicant Branches, the Lumbal Glands, the Triple-Division of the Receptacle, hitherto Unobserv'd, at least not Delineated. In the remain|ing Tables (I fear the tedious Enumeration of Particulars may tire the <HI>Reader</HI>'s Patience) are the Organs of Hearing, with the <HI>Meatus &agrave; Palato ad Aurem,</HI> and that from the Inner Ear to the Ex|ternal <HI>Meatus</HI>; the <HI>Foramina</HI> of the Tonsils which Evacuate the <HI>Pituita</HI>; the several Parts of the Tongue and <HI>Aspera Arteria</HI>; the <HI>Basis</HI> of the Brain, that of the <HI>Cranium</HI>; the Muscles of the Face and Lips, several of which are not Describ'd, and the rest Erroneously.</P>
<P>In this Undertaking I have been Oblig'd to my Learned Friend <HI>Dr. Tancred Robinson,</HI> in Re|vising as many Sheets as his Leasure would give him leave. In the last Place, to render the whole more Useful, a Copious <HI>Index</HI> is added at the End; which if the <HI>Reader</HI> finds Useful, he is Oblig'd to return his Thanks to the Deserving Mr. <HI>James Fern</HI> the <HI>Surgeon,</HI> who was at the Trouble of digesting the Contents of this Work, into an <HI>Alphabetical</HI> Order, which my Avocations would by no means permit me to do.</P>
<P>&mdash;If the <HI>Reader</HI> happens to Discover any Literal Errors, of which some may be found, it is hop'd he will Excuse them, upon Account of the Haste and Distance of the Press; the Practice in my Profession not suffering me always to Revise every minute Passage.</P>

<HEAD>THE ANATOMY OF HUMANE BODIES.</HEAD>
<P>_BEFORE we enter on the Anatomical Description of Hu|mane Bodies, let us take a View of their External Parts, as they appear in the Living State: Here we shall First briefly take notice of their most remarkable Appearance in the Embryo and Foetus of the Womb; and thence proceed to observe the several Stages of Proportion from Children to those of a Full|grown State, and Old Age: To these we shall add the dif|ferent Proportions of Men and Women; and lastly the Ex|ternal Appearance of the Muscles and other Parts in divers Actions.</P>
<P>If a Praeexistence of Parts in an Embryo was allowable, that at Twenty five days after Conception (Figured <HI>Tab.</HI> 57. <HI>Fig.</HI> 3.) would incline us to believe the Brain and whole Head had a Precedency, since its Magnitude then exceeds the whole Bulk of the rest of the Parts; but as the time of the Birth advances, the Head of the Foetus does not commonly exceed a Fourth Part in its whole Length.</P>
<P>The Center or Middle Part between the two Extreams of the Head and Feet of an Infant, is in the Navel; but that of an Adult in the <HI>Ossa Pubis</HI>: And this Pro|portion of dividing Children into Four Parts, whereof the Head is one, is common|ly made use of by <HI>Painters</HI> and <HI>Sculptors,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>A Child Two Years old has about Five Heads in its whole Length; but one of Four or five Years, has about Six; thus measured, by dividing the whole Body into so many Lengths, whereof the Head must be one. Hence it appears, as the Growth of the Body advances, there is a gradual Approach to the Proportion of an Adult of Eight, nine, or ten Faces in the whole Length.</P>
<P>There are many Bodies in a Full-grown State, which have not above Four or five Lengths or Faces; but those are Miscarriages in Nature, and therefore not Subjects of our present Consideration.</P>
<P>About the Fifteenth or sixteenth Year, Seven Faces or Lengths are then the Proportion or Measure, and the Center inclines towards the upper Parts of the <HI>Ossa Pubis</HI>; and tho' this Proportion may serve indifferently for a short well-set thick Person, when the Shoulders are broad, and the Limbs thick, and strong; yet if on the contrary the Shoulders are somewhat narrow, and the Limbs slender, it will represent a Youth: And however Paradoxical it may seem at first, yet an Old Woman, or the Goddess <HI>Vesta</HI> will fall under this Proportion of Lengths, thro' the bending forwards of the Back-bones; and tho' the Limbs bear a Propor|tion to one of Eight or nine Faces, yet they not being duly extended (for want of the vigorous Action of the Muscles) render the Appearance of the whole Fi|gure very short.</P>
<P>The Ancients have commonly allowed Eight Heads to their Figures, says the Author of the Observations on Mr. <HI>Du Fresnoy</HI>'s Art of Painting, made English by the Incomparable Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>; but we, says he, divide the Figure [of a Hu|mane Body] into Ten Faces, from the Crown of the Head to the Sole of the Foot, in the following manner: <HI>N.B.</HI> That this Number of Faces depends on the Age, as above hinted, and the Quality of the Persons represented. The <HI>Apollo</HI> and <HI>Venus de Medices</HI> have more than Ten Faces.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="table">
<PB REF="12">
<HEAD>THE FIRST TABLE.</HEAD>
<P>_FROM the Crown of the Head 1, to the upper part of the Forehead A, is the Third Part of a Face.</P>
<P>The Face begins at the Roots of the lowest Hairs, which are upon the Forehead AB, and ends at the Bottom of the Chin I.</P>
<P>The Face is divided into Three proportionable Parts; the First contains the Forehead AB; the Second the Nose C; and the Third the Mouth and Chin GHI.</P>
<P>From the Chin to the Pit between the Two Coller-bones, or upper Part of the <HI>Sternum,</HI> are Two Lengths of a Nose.</P>
<P>From the Pit between the Two Coller-bones to the Bottom of the Breast, called <HI>Scrobiculus Cordis</HI> N, One Face.</P>
<P>From the Bottom of the Breasts to the Navel R, one Face; the <HI>Apollo</HI> has a Nose more.</P>
<P>From the Navel to the <HI>Pudenda</HI> S, One Face; but the <HI>Apollo</HI> has Half a Nose more: and the upper Half of the <HI>Venus de Medices</HI> is to the lower Part of the Belly, and not to the Privy Parts.</P>
<P>From the Genitories or <HI>Pudenda,</HI> to the upper Part of the Knee, called the Thigh W, Two Faces.</P>
<P>The Knee contains Half a Face.</P>
<P>From the lower part of the Knee to the Ancle, call'd the Leg, Two Faces.</P>
<P>From the Ancle or <HI>Malleolus internus</HI> to the Sole of the Foot, Half a Face.</P>
<P>A Man, when his Arms are stretched out, is from the Extremity of the Longest Finger of his Right Hand to the Extremity of the Longest of his Left, as broad as he is long.</P>
<P>From one side of the Breasts to the other below the Paps M M, Two Faces.</P>
<P>The Bone of the Arm call'd <HI>Humerus</HI> is the Length of Two Faces from its Conjunction with the Shoulder-blade to the Elbow. Here we think our Author is mistaken, for if you allow Two Faces to that Part of the Arm between the Shoulder and bending of the Cubit, and Two more from the Elbow to the Root of the Little Finger, when the Fingers contain Half a Face, and the Distance between the Point of the Shoulder, and Pit of the Throat, a Whole Face; you will make Five Faces and Half on each Side or Half Length, which amounts to Eleven Faces in the Whole: But if you add to this what he says afterwards, that the Boxes of the Elbows with the <HI>Humerus,</HI> and of the <HI>Hu|merus</HI> with the Shoulder-blade, bear a Proportion of Half a Face, when the Arms are stretched out; then the Whole Distance between the Extremities of the Two Middle Fingers, when the Arms are so extended, will amount to Eleven Faces and a Half; wherefore we think the Account may stand Corrected thus.</P>
<P>From the Pit of the Throat to the Top of the Shoulder or Extremity of the Spine of the <HI>Scapula,</HI> One Face; from thence to the bending of the Cubit or Elbow, one Face and a half; thence again to the Wrist, One Face and a Nose. The Hand with the Fingers Extended contain One Face: hence it follows that Four Faces, a Nose, and Half a Face, is the distance between the Throat Pit, and Extre|mity of the Middle Finger; which upon extension of the whole Arm, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> will amount to Five Faces, or rather more than less.</P>
<P>The Sole of the Foot, is the Sixth part of the whole Figure, says our Author; but the Foot ought not to exceed a Face, and a Nose in Length.</P>
<P>As for the Breadth of the Limbs, no precise Measure can be given, because the Measures themselves are not only changeable according to the Quality of the Persons, but according to the Movement of the Muscles.</P>
<P>A Man is Two Lengths or Faces from the Point of each Shoulder; that is to say, from the Upper Part of the <HI>Sternum</HI> between the <HI>Claviculae</HI> call'd the Pit of the Throat, to the Extremity of the Spine of the <HI>Scapula,</HI> call'd the Top of the Shoulder, One Length; and so on the other Side.</P>
<P>The Breadth of the Hips of a Man is One Length and a Half; that is, from the great <HI>Trochanter</HI> of the Thigh Bone of one Side, to that of the other: The precise Places of which Bones are intersected by an Horizontal Line drawn from the <HI>Pubes</HI> to each Side.</P>

<HEAD>THE SECOND TABLE</HEAD>
<P>_REPRESENTS the Fore-part of a Woman, in whom the <HI>Symmetry</HI> or Proportion differs from that of a Man: First, that most remarkably the Shoulders are narrower; the Man having Two Lengths or Faces in the Breadth of his Shoulders, and One and a Half in his Hips; whereas a Wo|man on the contrary, has but one Face and a Half in her Shoulders, and Two in her Hips: Secondly, the <HI>Claviculae</HI> or Channel-bones, and Muscles in general do not appear in Women as in Men; whence it is, the out Line of the one, as <HI>Painters</HI> call it, differs very much from that of the other. Nor will any Action, in which a Woman uses her utmost Strength, occasion such Swellings or Risings of the Muscles and other Parts to appear, as they do in Men; since the great Quantity of Fat placed under the Skins of Women so cloaths their Muscles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as prevents any such Appearance.</P>
<P>We cannot conceive this one Quantity, and more equal Distribution of Fat under the Skins of Women does intirely proceed from any peculiar Qualification, either in their Whole Frame, or intimate Structure of their Parts where it is produced; but by reason they lead a more sedentary Life, and are scarce at any time ac|custom'd to hard Labours, whereby their Fatty <HI>Vesiculae</HI> (exprest <HI>Tab.</HI> 4. <HI>Fig.</HI> 14.1, 2, 3.) are comprest, by the frequent Operations of their Muscles, so as to prevent that more equal Distribution, and increase of their contain'd Oyl: Yet on the other hand, it must be acknowleg'd, that the Legs, and Feet of Women, and even those who walk much, do not afford those Muscular Appearances like those of Men, which we might expect, were it not that Women did suffer very much in those Parts; whether in the time of Impregnation, when the <HI>Uterus</HI> by its Extension so presses the Iliack Veins, as to hinder the Progress of the refluent Blood, whence the whole Legs become Swell'd, and frequently <HI>Varices</HI> of their External Veins pro|ceed; or when the <HI>Menstrua</HI> are Obstructed, the Legs (thro' a Plenitude of Sero|sities in the Vessels) are incident to suffer in like manner in their outward Inclo|sures, by reason of the Unaptness of their Position to discharge their refluent Blood.</P>

<HEAD>THE THIRD TABLE.</HEAD>
<P>_WHAT has been said, in the preceding Table, relating to the Appearance of the External Parts of a Man, or Woman, may indifferently serve this Place; wherefore we shall proceed to the last Part of our Design in these Animadversions, <HI>viz.</HI> Of the External Appearance of the Muscles, and other Parts, in divers Actions. If a strong Person is to be represented in a vigorous Action, such as <HI>Hercules</HI> &amp;c. after a suitable Proportion to such a Figure, and the Action is design'd; the next Thing the <HI>Painter,</HI> or <HI>Scul|ptor</HI> is to consider, which are those Parts, or Limbs imploy'd in the chiefest Force of the Action; and if the Figure is standing, let him be sure one Leg, and particularly its Foot, be in a Right Line, or Per|pendicular to the Trunk, or Bulk of the Body, where the <HI>Center</HI> of its <HI>Gravity</HI> may be plac'd in an <HI>Aequilibrium</HI>: This <HI>Center</HI> is determin'd by the Heel; or if the Figure is on Tiptoe, as it's call'd, then the Ball of the Great Toe is the <HI>Center</HI>; the Muscles of this Leg, which thus support the Body, ought to be exprest more in Action, or Swelled in their Bellies, and their Ten|dons drawn more to an Extension, than those of the other Leg, which is plac'd only in Order, to receive the Weight of the Body towards that Way, to which the Action inclines it: As for Example, suppose <HI>Hercules</HI> was with a Club, or the like, stri|king at any Thing which stood before him towards his Left Side; then let his Right Leg be plac'd so as to support the whole Weight of his Body, and the Left loosly touching the Ground only with its Toes. Here the External Muscles of the Right Leg ought to be exprest very Strong, or much Tumified: but those of the Left, scarcely appearing more than if the whole Figure was in some sedentary Posture; except, as in the Case now mention'd, the Foot being extended, then the Muscles, which compose the Calf of the Leg, are in Action, and appear very Strong; as it is well exprest in the Right Leg of that excellent Figure of the Ancients, the <HI>Gladiator</HI> in Prince <HI>Borgheses</HI>'s Palace at <HI>Rome</HI>; of which, we have only a Copy, or Cast, plac'd by the Canal in St. <HI>Iames</HI>'s <HI>Park.</HI> When we say, the External Muscles of the Right Leg, or that which supports the Weight of the Body, ought to be exprest very Strong; we don't mean that all those Muscles should be exprest equally Swell'd, or in Action; but that those chiefly Concern'd in that Action, or Posture, that the Leg is then in: As for Example, if the Leg, or <HI>Tibia</HI> is extended, then the extending Muscles, plac'd on the Thigh, are most Swell'd; if it is Bended, then the Bending Muscles, and their Tendons appear most. The like may be observ'd of the whole Body in General, when it is in pursuit of some vigorous Action; as appears in that Figure of the <HI>Gladiator</HI> last mention'd. The <HI>Laocoon</HI> in the <HI>Vatican</HI> Garden at <HI>Rome</HI> also furnishes us with an Example of this Muscular Appearance thro' the Whole; but in the <HI>Antinous, Apollo,</HI> and other Figures also of the Ancients, in the <HI>Vatican,</HI> and other Places, in Postures where no considerable Actions are design'd, we see their Muscles exprest but Faintly, or scarcely Appearing; whence we can't but think the <HI>Sculptors</HI> of those Times were very well ac|quainted with these Observations. Tho it be granted, the ancient <HI>Greeks</HI> were accustom'd to see <HI>Nudities</HI> very Often, nay, almost Constantly; yet the Difficulty of Copying these things from the Life is so Great, that unless they were well acquainted with such like Remarks, they would fall short of Nature in such Performances; since it is well known, even the Life it self, when expos'd to the Artist, can't continue those vigorous Actions for any time; but the Muscles fall, and the Parts loose their necessary Appearance in Action, tho' the Posture is the same. Hence it is, that Limbs, tho' Cast, or Moulded from the Life it self, are not strictly to be follow'd, unless the Life could continue the whole Spirit, or Force of the Action during the time, that the Mould was making from it, which I am apt to think is next to an Impossibility; however it might be attempted, at least in some particular Parts. Wherefore a rational Theory must help us, at least, to such Hints, that when we see, we may know what to observe, and the Reason why it appears so in the Life.</P>
<P>This is indeed a very Entertaining Study, which many of our Modern <HI>Painters</HI> and <HI>Sculptors</HI> are least acquainted with.</P>
<P>Thus far, in General, relating to the Muscles, &amp;c. In the next Place, let us take Notice of some particular Appearances of the External Muscles, and other Parts: First, of the <HI>Musculi Mastoidii (vid. App. Fig.</HI> 1.14.14.) if either of these Act, the Head is turn'd to the contrary Side, and the Muscle, which performs the Action, appears very Plain under the Skin, and is often well exprest both by <HI>Painters</HI> and <HI>Sculptors,</HI> as is represented in the Neck of the Figure of the First Table.</P>
<P>If the Arms are lifted up, the Swelling of the Muscles, plac'd on the Shoulders, which perform that Action, call'd <HI>Deltoides, (App. Fig.</HI> 1.20.) make the Extremities of the Spines of the Shoulder-blades, (<HI>App. Fig.</HI> 2.<HI>ii.</HI>) call'd the Tops of the Shoulders, appear Hollow, or Indented.</P>
<P>The Shoulder-blades follow the Elevation of the Arms, their <HI>Basis (App. ib. l, l.)</HI> incline, at that Time, Obliquely Downwards.</P>
<P>If the Arms are drawn Down, put Forwards, or pull'd Backwards; the Shoulder-blades necessarily vary their Positions ac|cordingly; all which is to be learnt by consulting the Life only; when being well acquainted with what then appears in the very Action, the Artist will be able to comprehend an <HI>Idea,</HI> how to express it: Hence it is, we seldom find the Back so well exprest, as the Fore-parts; the Latter not being subject to such various Alterations, as the Motions of the Shoulder-blades cause in the Former.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Cubit,</HI> or Arm is Bended, the Two-headed Muscle call'd <HI>Biceps Internus (App. Fig.</HI> 22.) has it's Belly very much Rais'd; as appears in the Left Arm of the Figure of the First Table: The like may be observ'd of the <HI>Biceps Externus,</HI> call'd <HI>Ge|mellus, (App. Fig.</HI> 2.17, 17.) when the Arm is extended.</P>
<P>The Right Muscle of the <HI>Abdomen (App. Fig.</HI> 1.41.41.) appears very Strong in Rising from a decumbent Posture.</P>
<P>Those Parts of the great Saw-Muscle before, (<HI>App. ib.</HI> 40, 40.) which are receiv'd in the Teeth, or Beginnings of the Oblique Descending Muscle (<HI>ib.</HI> 38, 38.) are very much Swell'd, when the Arm on the same Side is thrust Forwards; that Saw-Muscle then being in Action in drawing the <HI>Scapula</HI> Forwards also.</P>
<P>The long extending Muscles of the Trunk, plac'd on each Side the Back-bone, (<HI>App. Fig.</HI> 2. **) Act alternately in Walk|ing after this manner; if the Right Leg bears the Weight of the Body, and the Left is in Translation, as on Tiptoe; the last mention'd Muscles of the Back on the Left Side, may be observ'd to be Tumified about the Region of the Loyns; and so on the other Side.</P>
<P>The <HI>Trocanthers,</HI> or outward, and uppermost Heads of the Thigh-bones (<HI>App. Fig.</HI> 2. <HI>r, r.</HI>) vary in their Positions, in such manner, as no precise Observations can explain their several Appearances; but the Study after the Life will soon inform the diligent observing Artist.</P>
<P>If the Thigh is Extended, as when the whole Weight of the Body rests on that Side, the <HI>Glutaeus,</HI> or Buttock-Muscle, (<HI>App. Fig.</HI> 2. 32, 32.) makes a different Appearance, from what offers at another Time; but if the Thigh is drawn Back|wards, that Muscle appears still more, and more Tumified.</P>
<P>When the whole Leg is drawn Upwards, Forwards, and at the same time the Foot inclin'd Inwards, the upper Part of the <HI>Musculus Sartorius (App. Fig.</HI> 1.44.) appears rising very strong; in other Positions of the Thigh that Muscle makes a furrowing Appearance in its whole Progress, as is exprest in the Figure of the First Table.</P>
<P>If a Man is on Tiptoe, the extending Muscles of the Shank, placed on the Forepart of the Thigh (<HI>App. Fig.</HI> 1. 46, 47, 48.) and those of the Foot, which compose the Calf of the Leg, (<HI>App. Fig.</HI> 2. 43, 44.) appear very strong, and the <HI>Musculus Peroneus primus (App. Fig.</HI> 1.55.) makes a considerable Indentation, or furrowing at that time in its Progress, on the Outside of the Leg.</P>
<P>Besides these Remarks we could mention many more, which will soon be taken Notice of by the observing Artist in consulting the Life; to which he ought to apply himself, after he is well acquainted with the <HI>Anatomy</HI> of the External Parts; see the First, and Second Figures of our <HI>Appendix.</HI></P>

<P>_REPRESENTS a Portion of the <HI>Cuticula</HI> or Scarf-skin, rais'd from the Back of the Hand, and viewed with a Microscope.</P>
<P>A A, The Perforations or Pores, whereby the Sweat is discharged.</P>
<P>B B, The Indentures or Furrows.</P>
<P>C C, The Bladder like Protuberances; both these arise from the Inequallity of the Papillary Surface of the Skin it self.</P>
<P>D D, The Hairs which break forth through the <HI>Cuticula.</HI></P>
<P>E E, The Asperities or Filaments, by which the <HI>Cuticula</HI> is fastned to the True Skin.</P>
<P>With the Assistance of the Microscope, the <HI>Cuticula</HI> appears composed of divers <HI>Strata</HI> or Beds of Scales, fastned to the Papillary Surface of the Skin; and are so intangled with each other, as that they appear a con|tinued Pellicle or Membrane when rais'd from the True Skin, whether by the Application of Blister-Plasters in Living People, or Scalding Water, Hot Irons, or the like, in Dead Bodies: According to the Number of these <HI>Strata</HI> or Beds of Scales, the Skin appears to be more, or less Fair, and the Person is commonly said to have a thicker or thinner Skin; tho' ve|ry frequently the Jaundice and other Diseases give it an ill Tincture. The <HI>Cuticula</HI> like the True Skin is not Uniform, in divers Parts of it the Number of its Scales and their <HI>Strata</HI> exceed those of others; on the Lips not above two <HI>Strata</HI> appear; on other parts more, seldom less; in the Bottoms of the Feet of those who walk much, and the Palms of the Hands of Laborious Mechanicks, these <HI>Strata</HI> are not only very nu|merous, but each Scale is thickned. If you Macerate the <HI>Cuticle</HI> in Water, after some days, its <HI>Strata</HI> of Scales will appear, and you may divide it in|to Two, sometimes Three, or Four Pellicles; the like Division of it may be also observ'd in <HI>Vesicatories</HI> or Blisters rais'd on Living Persons.</P>

<P>The External Surface of the Skin, when view'd with a Microscope; where its Internal Structure or <HI>Rete</HI> of Blood Vessels are also exprest.</P>
<P>A A, The <HI>Papillae Pyramidales</HI>; made up of divers Pyramidal Round|ish Glands, in whose Composition the Nerves have a considerable Share.</P>
<P>B B, The Capillaments of the little Aqueous Vessels placed between the <HI>Papillae</HI> according to <HI>Bidloo.</HI> I must confess notwithstanding all the Diligence I could yet use in examining this Part with the Micro|scope, or otherwise, I have hitherto doubted of the Existence of these Aqueous Vessels, between the <HI>Cuticula</HI> and <HI>Cutis</HI>; in which some have placed the Seat of that Tawny Tincture of the <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> and that Black one of the <HI>Aethiopians.</HI></P>
<P>C C, The Sudoriferous Glands, which compose the <HI>Papillae.</HI></P>
<P>D D, The Sweat Vessels or Excretory-ducts arising from the last mentioned Glands.</P>
<P>E E, The Hairs arising near the Pores of the Sweat Vessels: Be|sides these Vessels, the Skin is furnished with Arteries, Veins, Nerves, and Lympheducts; the Trunks of the Two former are well exprest in this Figure F F: Hence it appears the Skin can no more be esteem'd a Similar or Simple Part, than any of those call'd Dissimular or Compoun|ded Parts. Nor is there any Part of the whole Animal Oeconomy, that can be justly esteem'd Simple or not Compounded; even the Blood Ves|sels, Nerves, and Lympheducts are Compounded Parts, as shall be else where demonstrated. Besides the Pyramidal Sudoriferous Glands, which compose the <HI>Papillae Cutis,</HI> there are other Sudoriferous Glands placed on the Internal Surface of the Skin; the most considerable of these we find in the <HI>Axillae,</HI> where they are sometimes call'd <HI>Axillares,</HI> but more properly <HI>Miliares,</HI> from their Figure; the Axillary Glands lying un|derneath these Sudoriferous ones; they receiving the <HI>Lympha,</HI> brought into them by the Lympheducts springing from the whole Arm, do dis|charge it again into the Exporting Lympheducts in its Way to the Tho|racick Duct. There are other Sudoriferous Glands, tho' not so evident to the naked Eye, under the Skin of the Fingers, <HI>Inguina,</HI> and behind the Ears: The Hairy-scalp, Skin of the Forehead, Palms of the Hands, and Soles of the Feet are also furnished with these Glands; wherefore we shall not distinguish them with the Names of the Places of their Si|tuation, but choose to give them a more general Denomination, either as to their Office, as <HI>Glandulae Sudoriferae,</HI> or Figure, as <HI>Miliares.</HI> In the Skin also are placed those Bodies whence the Hairs arise; these, by some are also esteem'd Glands, and call'd <HI>Piliferae</HI>: These Piliferous Bo|dies or Glands, are furnished at their Roots with Importing and Exporting Blood Vessels, Nerves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Hairs being as it were their Excretory Ducts with this Difference from those of other Parts, <HI>viz.</HI> They receiving their separated Juyce immediatly from the Pores in the Extremities of the Blood Vessels; whereas the Hairs, as we conceive, have their Radi|cal Moisture transmitted to them by the Mediation of a Spongious Body which absorbs it from the circumjacent Parts: Hence it is that the Hairs grow in dead Bodies, when the Natural Motions of the Fluids cease. The Hair between the Light, and naked Eye, appears pellucid; but if viewed with a Microscope in that Position, it appears Spongy, or not unlike the Internal Part of a Cane: It seems to be compos'd of horny globular Particles variously joyn'd together, and colour'd, where it hath Plenty of Moisture, it is commonly Pendulous; if more Dry, it is Curl'd.</P>

<HEAD>Fig. 15.</HEAD>
<P>The Inside of the Membrane last described: The rise of this Membrane is commonly said to be from the Spines of the <HI>Vertebrae</HI> of the Back, because as I suppose that is the most stable Part to which it's Connected: It is co|extended with the Skin it self, as appears in most Parts, and has its Cor|responding <HI>Foramina</HI> for the Eyes, Nostrils, Ears, Mouth, <HI>Anus,</HI> and <HI>Pudendum</HI>: As to its Intimate Structure, I have always met with con|curring Experiments and Observations, of its being an Extensible Bo|dy, compos'd of divers <HI>Strata</HI> or Membranes, framing Cells, which have divers lesser Cells or <HI>Loculi</HI> within them; and in divers Parts, where the Loosness of the Skin it self would admit, those lesser Cells or <HI>Loculi,</HI> are fill'd with Oil, and are call'd Fat; but in other Parts where either the Hardness of the subjacent Bone, when the Skin is extended, as on the Top of the Skull, or the repeated quick Motions, as of the Eye|lids, or the Structure of the Part, as of the <HI>Penis</HI>; these Membranous <HI>Loculi</HI> are not so extended with Oil, as to make an Appearance of Fat; whence it is we find this Membrane much thicker in those Parts last mentioned, than in others; and on the contrary, thinner and fewer <HI>Strata</HI> of <HI>Laminae,</HI> where its Cells are partly possest with Fat. This Common Membrane is furnished with Vessels of all sorts; nor is it con|fin'd to the Surface of the Muscles only, but insinuates in their <HI>Intersti|tia,</HI> and helps to compose their Coverings; whence it happens that by blowing into the divided <HI>Strata</HI> of the Cells of this Membrane, the whole Body of the Animal is Tumified; which is commonly practised by Butchers, especially in dressing their Veal.</P>
<P>The common Integuments of the whole Body being demonstrated, we proceed to those particularly belonging to the Head; nor shall we omit speaking again of these hereafter, where any thing in their par|ticular Parts occurs to our Observation or Memory, which the suc|ceeding Figures may help us to explain.</P>

The De|sign of these Curvations in the Arteries, before they enter the Cavity of the Skull, is to prevent too great a Swiftness of the Current of the Blood through the whole Substance of the Brain, which being placed so near the Heart, would also suffer by its too great Pulsation; were it not that the Contorted Trunks of these Arteries lessened its force; else the frequent disorderly Motions of the Heart, would make us as often incident to suffer great Inconveniences in the Brain; yet neverthe|less we are incident to suffer in some Degree; whence 'tis that the Passions of the Mind, where|in the Heart is affected so suddenly, disorders the Reason.</P>

<P>The Structure of a Nerve exprest by the Assistance of a Microscope.</P>
<P>A, The Branch of a Nerve dissected from the Neck.</P>
<P>B, The Bloud Vessels passing in the Nervous <HI>Fibrillae</HI>: These Bloud Vessels I had an Opportunity once of discovering with my naked Eye in a very small Branch of the <HI>Par Quintum</HI> of the Head, where they were fill'd with <HI>Mercury,</HI> by pouring it into the Carotid Artery; but in examining the same Branch of the Nerve with my Microscope, I discovered a vast Number of smaller Branches of Blood Vessels, which did not before appear, lying still parallel with the Nervous Fibres, as here exprest; tho' without doubt divers of the Trunks of those Blood Vessels do intersect, and pass obliquely over the Nervous Fibres, espe|cially near their Extremities. From those Blood Vessels I am in|clin'd to think the Globular Contents of the Nervous Fibres take their rise immediatly, and not from the Brain, as it has been generally suppos'd; since the Fibres of the Brain, as well as the Nerves themselves do neither of them appear Tubulated, or hollowed Pipes according to their Length; but their Cavities are frequently interrupted with divers Cells, which make a Globular like Appearance; and this Structure of the Nervous Tubes is very easily demonstrated in the <HI>Tunica Retina</HI> of the Eye by the Assistance of the Microscope.</P>

H. and are evident to the naked Eye, especially in those, who Cry much, and are call'd, <HI>Puncta Lachrimalia</HI>: Soon after these Two Ducts leave the Great <HI>Can|thus</HI> of the Eye, they are united into One Trunk, call'd the Lachrimal Duct, which de|scends in a <HI>Foramen</HI> of the Second Bone of the Upper Jaw, <HI>Tab.</HI> 92. <HI>Fig.</HI> 1. D. into the Cavity of the Nostrils. In the great <HI>Canthus</HI> of the Eye arise those Tumours, call'd <HI>Aegilopes,</HI> whose contain'd Matter, when it degenerates into an Abscess, frequently frames <HI>Fistula's</HI> in that Part; and when the Membrane, which composes the Lachrimal Duct, within the Cavity of the Bone, becomes Tumified; the Passage of that Duct is rendred impervious, and Part of the Humor imploy'd in moistning the Eye-lids, is hindred in its Discharge that Way; whence the Cheeks become inflam'd by its running down on them; in which latter Case, besides opening the Tumor largely, we must also Perforate the Second Bone of the Upper Jaw or <HI>Os Lachrimale,</HI> into the Cavity of the Nose, whereby the Lachrimal Humor will afterwards be discharg'd: This Operation is best Practis'd with a pointed Actual Cautery, fitted with a proper <HI>Cannula</HI> or Director. The Incision in these Cases may be made according to the Direction of the Fibres of the <HI>Musculus Orbicularis Palpebra|rum</HI>; and in using the Actual Cautery, great care must be taken to defend the <HI>Palpebrae</HI>; which we have sometimes seen expos'd to the heated <HI>Cannula</HI> thro' the Strugling of the Pa|tient: After this Operation is thus perform'd, it is not necessary you should keep the Ex|ternal Wound open to expect an Exfoliation of the Fragments of the Bone thro' it; but after Three or Four days, when the Callosity is remov'd, and the Matter discharg'd, you ought to lessen your Dozils, or Tents, and permit the <HI>Sinus</HI> to fill with Flesh, and hasten a Cicatrice, and the Edges of the perforated Bone will pass off by the Nostril, as well as that Part of the Bone thrust in by the Cautery. Nor will any great Inconveniency fol|low if the Healed up Part should Imposthumate again, thro' the moving of the Frag|ments of the Bone towards the External Wound, if it is again open'd by Incision to dis|charge them; but should you keep the External Wound open long, either by hard Tents, or Escharoticks, you will not only procure a Discharge of the superfluous Tears, or Moisture that way; but the Perforation made in the <HI>Os Lachrimale</HI> will fill up, and you must be oblig'd to repeat the Use of the Actual Cautery, or thrust a Probe thro' it. I had almost forgot to tell you, that after the First Incision made in the External Parts, it is necessary you should pass your Knife down to the very Bone, and divide the Trunk of a large Artery, and Vein, which pass that way with the Lachrimal Duct, least the Flux of Blood at the time of the Operation should so cool the Cautery, as to prevent its Action.</P>

<P>B, A Muscle, whose Position renders it capable of pulling up the <HI>Ala Nasi</HI>; whence it is called <HI>Elevator Alae Nasi</HI>; and by <HI>Casserius, Pyramidalis,</HI> from its Figure; nor do we com|monly find this Muscle in Dissection; the fleshy Fibres on this Part, frequently taking the same Course with those of the <HI>Orbicularis Palpebrarum,</HI> do pass by the <HI>Ala Nasi.</HI></P>
<P>C, The <HI>Musculus Elevator Labii superioris proprius.</HI></P>
<P>DD, The <HI>Orbicularis Palpebrarum</HI>; This is a thin fleshy Muscle, circularly environing the Eyelids, to which it is inserted, not unlike the <HI>Sphincter</HI> Muscles of other Parts, as of the Lips, and the Bladder of Urin: It acts in drawing the Eyelids nearer each other; which we call shutting the Eyelids; but if this Muscle Acts vigorously, it not only draws the Eyelids close together, but forces the Bulb of the Eye into the Orbit. <HI>Galen</HI> and the ancient Anatomists not discovering the <HI>Musculus Ape|riens Palpebrarum Rectus,</HI> (since found out by <HI>Fallopius,</HI>) were at a loss for assigning a proper Instrument to draw up the Upper Eyelid; wherefore they erroneously divided this Or|bicular Muscle into Two: The like error has been incident to some later Writers, among which <HI>Bidloo</HI> falls into the same Mistake.</P>

<P>I have frequently met with Tumors on this Part, which have required Incision; in which Case the dividing of this Artery ought to be regarded; wherefore I have rather cho|sen first to make Two Perforations, one on each Side this Ar|tery, whether by Caustick or otherwise, and then pass a Liga|ture to comprehend the Artery for some Days; and tho' I cannot advise the Practice of letting the Ligature divide the whole, by frequently straightening it; yet in Three or Four Days time the Ligature will so compress the Artery, that you may cut through free from any dangerous Flux of Blood.</P>

<P>The Outward Covering of the Tongue view'd with a Microscope: This Figure together with the 3^d, 4^t^h, 5^t^h, 6^t^h, 7^t^h, and 8^t^h, were done after the Tongues of some <HI>Quadrupedes,</HI> as of Bulls, Sheep, or the like. With the Assistance of a Microscope, an Appearance not altogether unlike this may be found on a Humane Tongue; without any Horny Covering like that described by <HI>Bidloo</HI> in these Figures, as follows.</P>
<P>A, That Part towards the Tip of the Tongue,</P>
<P>B, That towards the Root may be seen, arising from the Membrane underneath, a sort of Bodies of a Toothlike Form C C, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> hard as Cartilages, or the Nailes; for which reason (says he) I call them <HI>Ungulae</HI>: Betwixt these (he further adds) are placed certain forked Bodies of the same Stru|cture: (See <HI>Fig.</HI> 3.) Between these Two Kinds of Bodies, and sometimes upon them, are placed cer|tain Bladder-like <HI>Pyriformal,</HI> and <HI>Pellucid Glo|buli.</HI> (<HI>Fig.</HI> 2. D.) These <HI>Ungulae</HI> are framed by the manifold joyning together of <HI>Fibrous Lamellae.</HI> (See <HI>Fig.</HI> 4. A.) whose Middle B, is Medullary and Pervious; but the <HI>Globuli</HI> are hollow like Blad|ders: Both these kinds are clotted about with a strong tensile Membrane (<HI>Fig.</HI> 2. E.) to which they are fastned on their Sides. This Membrane is supported with Hairy <HI>Stamina</HI> F. like the Mem|brane immediatly under it, which subjacent Mem|brane is Perforated by the aforesaid Bodies, as ap|pears in (<HI>Fig.</HI> 6.) In some of the Interstices of these Bodies there may certain Cavities G, <HI>Fig.</HI> 2. be disco|ver'd; whose Bottom is very Porous. The Appea|rance of the Back Part of these Bodies is represented in <HI>Fig.</HI> 5. A, The broken <HI>Globuli.</HI> B, The <HI>Aspe|rities</HI> of the <HI>Ungulae.</HI> C, The Hairy Membranous Covering. D, The porous Apertures. The Upper Covering being remov'd, the Second or Subjacent Membrane, mention'd above, comes in view. <HI>Fig.</HI> 6. Spread like a Net; the Duct of whose Fibres is so intricate and various, that nothing certain can be determin'd of their Order; For in a Raw Tongue it is glutinous, in a Boyl'd one exten|dible; its Superiour Part exprest in this Figure, is whitish and thinner; but the Lower is observ'd to be thick, and more tenacious. (See <HI>Fig.</HI> 7.) Its Per|forations AA, <HI>Fig.</HI> 6. answer to the Number of the <HI>Ungulae</HI>: Here also may be observ'd several small Vessels B, creeping along, and running to the Su|perficies of the Tongue. The Edges of these Per|forations are made rough by small Fibres and Vessels of their own, as well as of the broken <HI>Un|gulae.</HI> The like Structure may be observ'd every where in the Membrane in the Inside of the Mouth, especially in the Palat. Under this Net|like Covering some Nervous Papillary <HI>Plexus. Fig.</HI> 8. A, and certain Glands B are hid; the Tops of which are inseparably joyn'd to the above nam'd Medullary Middles of the <HI>Ungulae</HI>: So that these <HI>Ungulae,</HI> like little Horns, cover those Pa|pillary Bodies like a Membrane spread over them: These <HI>Papillae</HI> are tyed in several Places to the Carnous Fibres of the Tongue; of these, some are Large C; some Smaller D; some confused and in Heaps E; others more distant, and distinct, and of different Figures; about These are placed a great many Glands F, to which the Vessels of the Net-like Covering do adhere.

<P>C C E, The <HI>Rectus Minor Posticus</HI> on the Left Side laid bare, and remaining <HI>in Situ</HI>; on the Right Side it is partly hid by the <HI>Rectus Major.</HI></P>
<P>D D, The Insertions of the <HI>Recti Minores</HI> to the <HI>Os Occipitis</HI>; they derive their Originations from the Back-part of the First <HI>Vertebra</HI> of the Neck, and not from any Condyliform Process of that <HI>Vertebra,</HI> as <HI>Bidloo</HI> discribes them; the First <HI>Vertebra</HI> of the Neck, not only wanting such a Process, but is constantly without any Process in that Part, as has been taken Notice of by most, if not all Anatomists.</P>
<P>Those <HI>Recti Minores</HI> pull the Head backward on the First <HI>Vertebra</HI> of the Neck, and from their Use may be call'd <HI>Renuentes</HI> or Nodders backwards, and are An|tagonists to a small Pair of Muscles in the Forepart of a Right Position also; to distinguish which, from these, we call them <HI>Recti Minores Antici,</HI> and <HI>Annuentes</HI> from their Use, of which, we shall add a Figure in our <HI>Appendix.</HI></P>
<P>F F, The <HI>Obliqui Inferiores</HI>; that of the Right Side remaining <HI>in Situ,</HI> the Left being free'd from its Insertion and remaining at its Origin: Either of them, arises from one of the Double Spinal Process's of the Second <HI>Vertebra</HI> of the Neck, and after an Oblique Ascent, is Inserted to the Transverse Process of the First <HI>Vertebra.</HI></P>
<P>When either of these Inferior Oblique Muscles Acts, it draws the Trans|verse Process of the First <HI>Vertebra</HI> near the Spine of the Second, and the Head by Consequence, is mov'd to the same Side, and is very much assisted by the <HI>Ma|stoideus</HI> on the contrary Side, of which in the following Table; If both Act, they conspire to hold the Head more stable.</P>

<P>_DIVERS Muscles of the Head and Neck, which appear in the Forepart after the Lower-Jaw, Tongue, <HI>Larynx, Aspera Arteria</HI> and <HI>Gula</HI> are removed.</P>
<P>A A, The <HI>Musculi Longi Colli,</HI> which arise partly Tendi|nous, but chiefly Fleshy, from the Foreparts of the Five Superior <HI>Vertebrae</HI> of the <HI>Thorax,</HI> and after a Dilatation, in the Middle of their Progress to Fleshy Bellies, they are inserted, in like Manner as they begin, to the Foreparts of all the <HI>Vertebrae</HI> of the Neck:</P>
<P>These may be called <HI>Flexores Colli</HI> from their Use.</P>
<P>B B, The Three <HI>Scaleni in Situ</HI>: The First of these Muscles arises Fleshy from the Forepart of the Second, Third and Fourth Transverse Processes of the <HI>Vertebrae</HI> of the Neck, and descending obliquely forewards, becomes Tendinous at its Insertion to the First Rib, the Axilary Nerves pass between this and the fol|lowing: <HI>Scalenus Secundus,</HI> in like manner springs from the Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth Transverse Processes of the Neck, and is inserted to the Second and sometime Third Rib. <HI>Scalenus Tertius,</HI> arises from the same Trans|verse Processes with the former; as also from the Fifth and Sixth, and is soon implanted into the First Rib.</P>

<P>The Origin, Progress, and Insertion of this Muscle, not being duly consi|dered, has led Anatomists into Errors concerning its Use: For if this Muscle Acts on either Side, the Mammillary Process on the same Side, is brought towards a Right Position with its Original at the <HI>Sternum,</HI> and the Head is turned to the Contrary Side; and this Action of it is commonly well exprest by <HI>Painters</HI>; but should it more and more contract, it will draw the Head to one Side fore|wards, as we see in Wry Necks (commonly so called) where one of these Muscles remains contracted; but if they, both Act together, the Head is rather pulled back than forewards, by how much their Insertions are rather behind the Mam|millary Processes, than upon them; which Processes are <HI>e Diametro</HI> opposite to the Articulation of the Head, with the First <HI>Vertebra</HI> of the Neck.</P>
<P>L L, The <HI>Recti Interni Majores Antici,</HI> by some called <HI>Par Rectum Internum Colli,</HI> says <HI>Bidloo</HI>; we have elsewhere called them <HI>Flexores Capitis</HI> from their Use: They Arise partly Fleshy, but chiefly Tendinous from the Fore-part of all the Trans|verse Processes of the <HI>Vertebrae</HI> of the Neck, except the First and Second be|coming Fleshy, are Inserted to the Anterior <HI>Appendix</HI> of the <HI>Os Occipitis,</HI> before the great <HI>Foramen</HI> that transmits the <HI>Medulla Oblongata.</HI></P>

<P>To examine the <HI>Papilla</HI> or Nipple, the following Method may be Practis'd. Insert a Blow-Pipe into one of the largest of the Lactiferous Tubes on the Top of the Nipple C C, <HI>Fig.</HI> 3. and after making a straight Ligature on the Nipple and Blow-Pipe, you may Blow up all the Lactiferous Tubes of the <HI>Mamma,</HI> thro' their Communications with each other, before they approach the Nipple Figur'd by <HI>Nuck A|denog. Curiosa,</HI> Fig. 11. Fol. 15. All the Lactiferous Tubes of the <HI>Mamma</HI> being thus extended with Wind; those Parts of Them which help to compose the <HI>Papilla</HI> (C C;) together with their Extremities within the Glands D D, being very much extended; make a straight Ligature on the Inferior Part of the Nipple next the Breast, then cut off the Nipple from the Breast and Dry it, and afterwards by cutting it Va|riously, you may easily examine its Structure: By these means the Nip|ple appears to be compos'd of a Double Series of Fibres; the one some|what Large, the other Less; both of a Net-like Disposition, being full of Perforations of divers Forms; the like of which is not to be found in other Parts of the Body, says <HI>Nuck</HI> in his Tract above mention'd; to this add a vast Number of Blood-Vessels which every where adorn the <HI>Papilla</HI>: Hence an Account may be given how the Nipples strut out, and are so extended in Nurses, and on the contrary so Limp in those who discontinue giving Suck.</P>
<P>I could never discover any Valves in the Lactiferous Vessels of the <HI>Mammae</HI> of Women, which some describe; tho' I have made Inje|ctions of divers Liquors, and sometimes Mercury into them; the like has been done by the Accurate <HI>Nuck,</HI> who, with what I have frequently observ'd, also takes Notice that the Mercury so Injected passes into the Blood-Vessels of the <HI>Mamma,</HI> especially its Arteries. But our last nam'd Author takes Notice of divers Straitnesses in the Lactiferous Vessels, occasion'd, as He suspects, by divers fatty hard Substances compressing Them, even to that Degree, that if their contain'd Milk becomes a little Thickned, it there stops thro' the Narrowness of the Duct, or requiring a longer Stay, it becomes so Vitiated as to Affect the Breast variously, especially with what are commonly call'd Milky Tumors; in which Case an Abscess succeeds, and the Milky Tubes break and discharge their Contents with the <HI>Pus.</HI> The Milk by these means flowing at the Ulcer, frequently proves troublesome, and hinders its Cicatrice or Closing, as it happen'd in the Case of a Patient I not long since had under my Care, who at the same time was infected with the Itch, in whom the Milk flow'd from the Ulcer for at least Three Months; nor could I find any tollerable Abatement of the Milky Flux, notwithstanding her dry Diet, and Drinking of a Decoction of <HI>Sarsa, China, Guaiacum,</HI> &amp;c. till she had taken proper Remedies for the Itch.</P>
<P>The Expert <HI>Nuck</HI> takes Notice that the Lactiferous Tubes, tho' ve|ry Capacious in the <HI>Mamma,</HI> yet are Straitned at their Orifices in the <HI>Papilla,</HI> insomuch, that a Bristle of the smallest Size will not enter them: This Contrivance, He adds, is very necessary, least the separa|ted Milk contain'd in the Tubes should be continually apt to run out, and that it should be only so retain'd, that the Nipple of the Mother when Suckt by the Infant may easily void it: This Structure is ve|ry evident in the Tets of Quadrupedes, especially where their pendu|lous Position renders this Contrivance very necessary; yet when the Lactiferous Tubes are fill'd with Milk, it is apt to run out.</P>

<P>The Arteries which convey Blood to the <HI>Mamma,</HI> are many small Branches, Springing from the Mammary and Intercostal Arteries; of these I told Six, which afforded a Flux of Blood without Pulsation in taking off a Schirrous Breast Here I cannot omit recommending to Pra|ctitioners of Surgery the Tying of these Arteries; the doing of which is so easie, that it is hardly possible for One tollerably acquainted with the same Practice in taking off of Limbs, to be at a loss in this. The Trunks of these Arteries Arising from the Mammary and Inter|costal Arteries, are very small, as they pass between the Pectoral Mus|cle and <HI>Mamma,</HI> as appears from the Blood not having any Pulsation as it flows from them when divided in Living Bodies, except the Breast which was taken off is much Tumified. You must not expect to ful them with Wax by Injecting into the <HI>Aorta</HI>; because you are oblig d to raise the <HI>Sternum</HI> in order to Practice that Operation; whereby you cut off their Communication with the large Mammary Artery adjacent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">; nor do's Wax commonly pass the Intercostal Arteries so far as to reach these. The Veins of the <HI>Mamma</HI> are Numerous, and pass on the Outside of the <HI>Mamma</HI> under the Skin only, and are very Conspicuous in those who give Suck, or have had Children: These Arise, or are continued from the Extremities of the Arteries and com|posing many large Trunks which discharge their Blood into the Mam|mary and Intercostal Veins; some pass up to the Subclavian Vein. The Nerves are commonly said to Arise from the Thoracick Nerves, and pass thro' the Intercostal and Pectoral Muscles to the <HI>Mamma</HI>: I must confess I never yet trac'd Them, nor do's <HI>Vieussemus</HI> Figure Them; but in his XXIV. Table Expresses Two Branches U, X, Arising from the Sixth and Seventh Nerves of the Neck composing one Trunk, which descends and gives Branches to the <HI>Musculi Serratus minor anticus, Pectoralis, Serratus major anticus,</HI> and to the Coverings of those Muscles: From the same Nervous Stock I am apt to think may also Spring some Branches passing to the <HI>Mamma,</HI> whence those pain|ful Communications between the <HI>Mamma</HI> and <HI>Axilla</HI> may proceed. Besides these Vessels the Lymphe-Ducts of the <HI>Mamma</HI> are also men|tion'd; I must confess I never yet saw these Ducts Arising from the <HI>Mamma,</HI> yet I can't doubt of their Existence on that Part, when I reflect on what Use they are of in General, in the Animal <HI>Oeconomy,</HI> of which elsewere. The Communication between the Lactiferous Tubes and Blood-Vessels, is demonstrated in the above mention'd Expe|riment, by Injecting Mercury into the Former, and its Running out again by the Later. The Opinion that the Chyle is transmitted to the <HI>Mamma</HI> immediately from the Thoracick Duct is now altogether Ex|ploded, and the last mention'd Experiment seems to evince the Milk to be deriv'd immediately from the Blood within the <HI>Mamma.</HI> It is evident, the Milk is not Transparent like other Liquors separated from the Blood, as the <HI>Saliva, Urine, Bile,</HI> &amp;c. but by a Microscope it appears compos'd of Globules not unlike those of the Blood, except that the Globules of the Blood are somewhat larger than those of Milk.</P>

<P>_DIVERS Muscles on the Superior and Fore-Part of the Trunk of the Body.</P>
<P>A, The <HI>Musculus Subclavius in Situ</HI>; when free'd from the Trunk of the Body and left to the <HI>Clavicula</HI>; (see <HI>Tab.</HI> 66. P.) It ariseth Fleshy from the Inferior Part of Half the <HI>Clavi|cula</HI> next its Connexion to the <HI>Spina Scapulae,</HI> whence its Fi|bres Descend Obliquely Forewards, to its partly Tendinous and partly Fleshy Implantation at the Superior Part of the First Rib next the <HI>Sternum.</HI></P>
<P>The Office of this Subclavian Muscle is to draw up the First Rib, and con|sequently the rest in Inspiration.</P>
<P>B, Part of the <HI>Clavicula</HI> on the Right Side.</P>
<P>C, The Cartilaginous Ending of the First Rib at the <HI>Sternum.</HI></P>
<P>D D, The <HI>Musculus Serratus Major Anticus in Situ</HI> on the Left Side; It ariseth Broad and Fleshy from the whole <HI>Basis Scapulae, Tab.</HI> 65. G G, and running on the <HI>Subscapularis Tab. ib.</HI> E, becomes broader and thicker as it passes Forewards to its Fleshy Insertions at the Eight Superior Ribs Laterally E E <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by di|vers distinct Portions by some called <HI>Digituli</HI>; of which, the Three Inferior, are Indented with the <HI>Musculus Obliquus Descendens Abdominis,</HI> as is here Exprest on the Left Side; on the Right Side the <HI>Serratus Major Anticus</HI> E F is raised.</P>
<P>G, Part of the <HI>Obliquus Descendens</HI> on the Lest Side Indented with the last men|tioned <HI>Serratus.</HI></P>
<P>H, The <HI>Pectoralis in Situ,</HI> on the Left Side; this Muscle has a Broad Semicir|cular Fleshy Beginning; above from near Half the Inferior Part of the <HI>Clavi|cula</HI> B; below from the <HI>Os Pectoris</HI> L, and all the Cartilaginous Endings of the Six Superior Ribs M M, and from the Bony Part of the Seventh Rib, it hath some|times a distinct <HI>Fasciculus</HI> of Fleshy Fibres which I have frequently seen Confound|ed with the <HI>Obliquus Descendens</HI>; hence it passeth Transversely over the Upper-Part of the <HI>Biceps Cubiti,</HI> where it is made into a short and broad strong Tendon In|serted to the Superior and External Part of the <HI>Os Humeri,</HI> above the Termina|tion of the <HI>Deltoides.</HI></P>
<P>I, The Right Pectoral Muscle rais'd, where the Decussation of its Fibres near its Insertion is well Exprest: This crossing of its Fibres is a Contrivance in Na|ture to render its Action more Vigorous; the Fibres of its Upper-Part De|scending to the Lower-Part of its Implantation to the <HI>Os Humeri,</HI> and those of its Lower-Part Ascend to the Superior; crossing each other with Acute Angles. This Muscle is call'd <HI>Adductor Humeri</HI>; when it Acts, it moves the Arm variously ac|cording to the Operation of its several <HI>Series</HI> of Fibres.</P>
<P>K, The <HI>Serratus Minor Anticus,</HI> raised from its Implantation at the Bony Parts of the Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth Ribs, and left at its Origin at the <HI>Pro|cessus Carocoides Scapulae.</HI></P>
<P>L, The <HI>Os Pectoris</HI> or <HI>Sternum.</HI></P>
<P>M M, The Cartilaginous Endings of the Superior Ribs Connexed to the <HI>Sternum.</HI></P>
<P>N N, The <HI>Deltoides. Vide Tab.</HI> 66. XX.</P>

<HEAD>THE TWENTY-FIRST TABLE.</HEAD>
<P>_SHEWS the <HI>Sternum</HI> Rais'd, and the Principal Organs contain'd in the <HI>Thorax</HI> partly in View. A, The Inner-Face of the <HI>Sternum</HI> or <HI>Os Pectoris.</HI></P>
<P>B B, The Cartilages of the True Ribs, cut from the Bony Extremities of the Ribs, and left at their Con|nexions to the <HI>Sternum</HI>: Upon these Cartilages are plac'd the <HI>Musculi Triangulares</HI>; which Muscles Arise from the Inferior and Internal Part of the <HI>Sternum,</HI> and after an Oblique Progress are inserted to the Bony Endings of the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and sometimes Seventh, and Eight Ribs. These Triangular Muscles scarcely appear in Macilent Subjects, as is Exprest in this Figure.</P>
<P>C, The <HI>Mediastinum</HI> free'd from the <HI>Os Pectoris,</HI> where, in Humane Bodies it appears Double, being a Continuation of the <HI>Pleura</HI> from both Sides the Internal Part of the <HI>Thorax</HI>; whence it Descends and firmly Cleaves to the <HI>Pericardium,</HI> dividing the <HI>Thorax</HI> into Two Cavities, and the Right Lobes of the Lungs from the Left: In this Progress of the <HI>Mediastinum</HI> it parts with One of its <HI>Laminae</HI> to cover the large Blood-Vessels within the <HI>Thorax.</HI> A Triangular Interstice is fram'd immediately under the <HI>Sternum</HI> at the Approach of the <HI>Pleura,</HI> from each Side as it Descends to compose the <HI>Mediastinum</HI>: Nor is this Interstice an empty Space as it is commonly suppos'd, but is interwoven with various Orders of Fibres, framing <HI>Loculi</HI> or little Cells. <HI>Real. Columbus</HI> Lib. xi. Cap. iii. Proposes the letting out of <HI>Pus,</HI> collected in this Interstice by Perforating the <HI>Sternum.</HI> As the Fore-part of the <HI>Mediastinum</HI> plainly appears a Continuation of the <HI>Pleura</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> so its Back-part is evidently a Continuation of the same Membrane, as it advances towards the <HI>Vertebrae</HI> of the Back. In Dissecting a Morbid Body, I found the Right Side of the Ca|vity of the <HI>Thorax</HI> so extended with a Serous Humor, as its External Appearance, (especially at the Cartilaginous Endings of the True Ribs,) was Prominent: Nor would the least Portion of the Lungs on the same Side Swim in common Water, but Sunk to the Bottom of the Vessel: In this Subject I could not find any Part of the Hydropick or Serous Humor in the other Side of the <HI>Thorax</HI>; but the Lungs on that Side in no very ill State. By this, we may be assur'd that the <HI>Mediastinum</HI> ade|quately divides the Right Side of the <HI>Thorax</HI> from the Left. The <HI>Mediastinum</HI> also supports the <HI>Pericardium,</HI> leaft its Flacci|dity impede the <HI>Systole</HI> of the Heart, and sustains the Trunks of the Nerves of the <HI>Par Vagum</HI> in their Progress thro' the <HI>Tho|rax.</HI> The Diaphragm is also said to be suspended by the <HI>Mediastinum,</HI> leaft the Liver, to whose Lower-Side it's Connexed, should become Insupportable. The <HI>Mediastinum</HI> receives Arteries from the Mammary and Intercostal Branches; it has Two large Veins which discharge their Blood into the Subclavian and Neighbouring Trunks: Its Nerves are said to Spring from the Eighth Pair. The Lymphe-Ducts of the <HI>Mediastinum</HI> pass towards the <HI>Thymus.</HI></P>
<P>D D, The <HI>Pericardium</HI> or <HI>Capsula Cordis</HI> Open'd and Pinn'd up. The <HI>Pericardium</HI> Arises from the large Vessels at the <HI>Basis</HI> of the Heart, and seems to be compos'd of a Continuation of the <HI>Pleura</HI> or <HI>Mediastinum.</HI> It adheres to the Diaphragm below, and laterally to the <HI>Mediastinum.</HI> It has Blood-Vessels from the Diaphragm and Mammary-Vessels, according to the Accu|rate <HI>Ruysch</HI> in his lately publish'd Epistles: The Capillary Extremities of these Blood-Vessels are very Numerous, as will appear when Injected with Mercury. There are divers Lymphe-Ducts on the <HI>Pericardium,</HI> which convey the <HI>Lympha</HI> to the Thora|cick-Duct. The Glands, which are in the <HI>Pericardium</HI> and at the <HI>Basis</HI> of the Heart, which separate that Humor imploy'd in Moistening the Inside of that Membrane and Surface of the Heart, are not to be discover'd by the naked Eye in ordinary Dissections; no more than those on the Inside of the <HI>Peritonaeum</HI> and Surface of the Intestines, which afford a Humor to Lu|bricate those Parts; but when either of these Parts are Diseased so that those Glands are Affected, their Existence then is De|monstrable; as appear'd in the <HI>Pericardium</HI> of an Infant I lately Dissected, where the Neighbouring Parts and <HI>Pericardium</HI> its self were Apostumated. In the <HI>Pericardiums</HI> of this Subject we found Two or Three Ounces of Purulent Matter in place of the Serous Humor; and the External Membrane of the Heart so loosned, as its Surface appear'd Villous; nor did any Fat appear on the <HI>Basis</HI> of the Heart. In an Adult Person who Died suddenly I found the <HI>Pericardium</HI> somewhat Thickned and no Humor contain'd in it; but in Two, or Three Places cleaving to the Heart especially near its <HI>Basis,</HI> and the Heart it self intirely cover'd with Fat; The Use of the <HI>Pericardium</HI> is to defend the Heart in its <HI>Systole</HI> from the Neighbouring Parts, and to contain a Humor to Moisten the External Surface of the Heart.</P>
<P>E, The Heart lying within the <HI>Pericardium.</HI></P>
<P>F F, Parts of the Lungs on both Sides the <HI>Thorax in Situ.</HI></P>
<P>G, The <HI>Thymus in Situ.</HI> The Magnitude of the <HI>Thymas</HI> varies according to the Age of the Body; in a <HI>Faetus</HI> Two Months after Conception it is larger in Proportion to the Bulk of the Body than in One of Five or Six Months: In a <HI>Faetus</HI> of Nine Months it almost fills the Interstice which the Lungs after the Birth begin to take up in the Upper-part of the <HI>Thorax.</HI> The <HI>Thymus</HI> after the Birth gradually decreases, except the Upper-part of the Cavity in the <HI>Thorax</HI> is Capacious enough for its Reception, as appear'd in an Anatomical Subject I lately Dissected of Thirty Years of Age, in whom the <HI>Thymus</HI> was very large: I must confess I never yet met with a Subject, tho never so Old, in whom the <HI>Thymus</HI> was wanting. In those Bo|di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the <HI>Thymus</HI> is less than ordinary, we find the Subclavian Glands, those of the Internal Jugular Veins, and the <HI>Glandule Thyraidam</HI> larger; as they lately appear'd in a Boy of about Eight Years of Age. In Women the <HI>Thymus</HI> and Thyroid Glands are larger than in Men, but the Subclavian Glands are less; by reason the <HI>Claviculae</HI> in Women are straight and shorter than those of Men; whence a much less Interstice is frain'd for entertaining those Glands. I have more than once found the Lymphe-Ducts fill'd with Wax, which Arise from the <HI>Thymus,</HI> and empty themselves into the Upper-part of the Thoracick-Duct; by Injecting that Duct by the <HI>Vesica Chyli</HI>: See <HI>App. Fig.</HI> 12. D.</P>
<P>From what has been abovesaid, it appears the <HI>Thymus</HI> bears a Proportion to the Head; whether in the <HI>Faetus</HI> or in Bodies before they become Adult, which we conceive, is in order to receive a Proportionable Quantity of <HI>Lympha,</HI> deriv'd from thence: And as the Subclavian Glands of Women are less than those of Men; so the Thyroide Glands and <HI>Thymus</HI> are larger: Hence also it appears the <HI>Thymus</HI> is a Lymphatick Gland, and Varies its Magnitude according to the Quantity of the <HI>Lympha,</HI> that is necessarily transmitted thro' it from the Superior Parts; or as the Neighbouring Lymphatick Glands do more or less transmit their <HI>Lympha</HI> to it: Besides this common Office of the <HI>Thymus,</HI> whether in the <HI>Faetus</HI> or Adult; it has another Use which was first suggested to Me by Injecting a Liquid into the Thoracick-Duct; when finding it not only fill the Lymphe-Ducts of the <HI>Thymus,</HI> but the <HI>Thymus</HI> it self was Extended with it: The like Observation, I since found, was made by the Expert Ana|tomist Dr. <HI>Tyson,</HI> some Time since; whence I conceive, the <HI>Thymus</HI> and its Lymphe-Ducts are <HI>Diverticula</HI> to the Chyle, when too great a Quantity is pressing forewards towards the Subclavian Vein. I know it may be Objected that the Valves of the Lymphe-Ducts oppose this contrary Course of Liquours in them; but repeated Observations convince me, that not only these Lymphe-Ducts of the <HI>Thymus,</HI> which are large and have very few if any Valves, (as appears by their being Injected with Wax) but those of the Loins, and their Glands from whence they Arise, are frequently fill'd with Chyle, when no Compress is made on the Thoracick-Duct. Hence it is, a Milky Liquor has been commonly found in the <HI>Thymus,</HI> but more frequent in that of a <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tus</HI> than i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> an Adult; and that not only because the <HI>Thymus</HI> and its Lymphe-Ducts are much larger Proportio|nably in the former State or <HI>Faetus,</HI> but the bended Position of the Thoracick-Duct of the <HI>Fetus in Vter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> renders the Ascent of the Chyle by that Duct more liable to Regurgitate by the Lymphe-Ducts of the <HI>Thymus.</HI></P>

The great Trunks of the Arteries do evidently appear to consist of a greater Number of <HI>Strata</HI> of Fibres, than those of the Veins; but the farther they recede from the Heart, they are both still more and more subdivided, and their Trunks and Capillary Branches become still thinner and thinner, till their outmost Extremities con|sist of one single transparent Membrane; chiefly composed of such Tubes, as only convey their <HI>Succus Nutritius.</HI> And this I am apt to think may serve for the Description of Blood-Vessels in general; and shall farther consider the Organization of the several Extremities of the Blood-Vessels, in speaking of their particular Offices relating to Se|cretion in the several Parts; wherefore at present shall only men|tion, that the Extremities of Veins and Arteries are continued Chan|nels, variously contorted and not all of them of an equal Size, even in Parts which are uniform or the same. <HI>Vid. App. Fig.</HI> 4.5.</P>
<P>After the Blood has past the Extremities of its Vessels, and is in its Return to the Heart again by the Veins; it there meets with divers Valves or Stops, which prevent the Weight of the Blood of the In|ferior Parts of the Body, and the Recoiling of it in the Superior, (when any violent Motions affect the <HI>Thorax,</HI> as in Coughing, from pressing on the Extremities of the Vessels, and hindering its progressive Motion. That there is a Recoiling of the Blood in any extraordinary Motions of the <HI>Thorax,</HI> in the Jugular Veins, may be observ'd in taking Blood from thence, especially in Children. Hence it is the Valves in those Veins are necessary; least the Blood should again repass into the Vessels of the Brain with great Violence; which is also prevented in the Contortion made in the Internal Jugular Vein, in its <HI>Specus</HI> in the <HI>Basis</HI> of the Skull. I must confess I never yet observed above Two Valves (one opposite to the other) in the largest Vein that is fur|nished with Valves; however Anatomists commonly mention Three, and Professor <HI>Bidloo</HI> tells us of Four and Five Valves, as they ap|pear in the following Figures.</P>

<P>Represents (according to <HI>Bidloo</HI>) a System of the Arteries injected with Wax, and free'd from the Body of an Infant Six Months Old; which he tells us he has reserved: If so, it is a great Rarity indeed! For having more than once free'd the Arteries from the Body of an Infant, as well as from an Adult, and finding them far differing from this Figure, and not much disagreeing with the Descriptions and Fi|gures of <HI>Vesalius</HI> and others; I cannot look on this, but as a Prodigy in Nature. Wherefore I shall here give you his Description of it, and refer you to my <HI>Appendix. Fig.</HI> 3. Where their common Ap|pearance is exprest, as I now have them injected by me, and dissected from the Body of an Infant.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arteria Aorta</HI> (say's <HI>Bidloo</HI>) arising from the Heart, soon sends out Two small Coronary Branches. B, in the Body of the Heart. Its Trunk is divided on the <HI>Pericordium</HI> into the Ascendens C, and Descendens D. The First gives Branches to the Parts above the Heart, and is divided into the <HI>Subclavii</HI> E, from which the <HI>Axillares</HI> F, and Internal Mammary G, Three or Four <HI>Intercostales</HI> H, and <HI>Cervicales</HI> I. do arise. From the Axillary Artery are Branches com|municated to the <HI>Scapula</HI> K, and to the Superior Parts of the <HI>Thorax.</HI> When it has got between the Muscles of the Cubit, it is divided into Two little Branches; the First of which L, goes to the Wrist, Thumb, and Fore-Finger; the other to the Three other Fingers. It divides into Two about the <HI>Thymus,</HI> and Forms the <HI>Carotides</HI> M. These ascen|ding near the Wind-pipe after having sent several Branches to the Tongue, <HI>Larynx</HI> and Parts adjacent, and are divided into the Exter|nal N, and Internal Branch O, the Exterior supplies the Face, Lips, partly the Ear and lower Teeth; the other Branch serves the Forehead, Temples and Neighbouring Parts.</P>
<P>The Inward Branch ascending streight through the <HI>Os Sphoenoides</HI> creeps under the <HI>'Dura Mater,</HI> and forming various <HI>Plexus's,</HI> in that Part within the Skull, it is cover'd with a particular Coat already de|scrib'd; it sends out small Branches near the Optick Nerves; but the large Trunks creep back again, sometimes united and by and by se|parated from each other. There are small Branches convey'd to the Spinal Marrow, partly above and partly below the Heart. From the Axillarie's, and ascending and descending Trunks, it derives several Branches which reflected into a Circle, creep through its Coverings and several Parts of the Head. The descending Trunk of the <HI>Aorta</HI> D, supply's some of the Intercostals 1, and the Neighbouring Muscles and Parts; there is a large Trunk 2, also sent to the Diaphragm; under the Diaphragm the Branches of the <HI>Viscera</HI> of the <HI>Abdomen</HI> are re|markable. <HI>viz.</HI> of the Stomach, 3. The Inferior and Superior Me|seraic Branches, 4, 5, those of the <HI>Omentum,</HI> or Caul, 6, of the Liver, 7, of the Kidneys 8, the Spermatics 9, and so on. About the <HI>Os Sa|crum</HI> this Trunk is divided into Two Branches, from which others are again deriv'd to the Right Gut and <HI>Pudenda,</HI> some to the Hips, some to the Thighs and Legs, as well Internally, as Externally. Thus much concerning the principal Distribution of the <HI>Aorta.</HI></P>
<P>In the next Place Professor <HI>Bidloo</HI> gives us the Anatomy of the Blood. In the Anatomy of the Blood Chymically performed (say's he) it is manifest there is a Water in it, which as well as it can be, is simply to be considered) a Spirit and Salts both fixt and volatile. Tho' by this Method (he very well say's) some Parts are very accurately disco|ver'd; yet doth it exceedingly destroy the Appearances of some Figures, which ought by no means to be alter'd; wherefore he proposed the following Figure.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="16" TYPE="illustration">
<HEAD>Fig. 16.</HEAD>
<P>A, A small Drop of Blood inclosed in a Glass Tube, and its Parti|cles by the Help of a Microscope are represented very much magnifyed.</P>
<P>B, The Globular Bladders.</P>
<P>C, The little Fibres variously turned, laid, and disposed, accord|ing to <HI>Bidloo.</HI> I must confess I have frequently view'd the Blood in the same Manner as here Exprest with a Microscope, and have con|stantly observed its Appearance as here represented: Nor could I ever apprehend the Blood was furnished with Fibres (so much talk'd of) but that the Fibrous Appearance it has, (when any Blood-Vessel is open in the Mouth, or in Bleeding into warm Water and the like) is owing to a Coagulation of its <HI>Serum,</HI> by which Means its Globules are entangled and frame those Fibrous Bodies: The Streaked Mass repre|sented at D, E. (according to <HI>Bidloo</HI>) I am apt to think proceeded from a Coagulation of the Serous Part of the Blood, by sealing the Tube Hermetically; in doing which the Glass must be heated. To this our Author adds another Way of Anatomizing the Blood, thus:</P>
<P>The watery whitish Liquor, which is of a different Substance, being separated from the cold coagulated Mass of Blood, and set on the Fire, thickens in a short Time; the red Part which remains, (of which the more fluid Part being frequently washt away with warm Water,) appears like a grumous Heap; every Particle of which resembles a Glo|bular Bladder; of which, some are Transparent, others not. The rest of the Mass which consists of very flexible Fibres, according to <HI>Bidloo,</HI> and being exposed to the Air and Cold, become very tough, tensile, and seem like Net-work, owe that Appearance to a Combination of the Globules variously stratified on each other.</P>
<P>The Third Way (which our Author proposes) of enquiring into the Blood, is when the Blood is separated from the <HI>Serum</HI> or Li|quor it swims in, and put on a Piece of Paper dawb'd over with Lard, is become a little dry; after an External View of the Particles, gently with the Finger break off a little of the Mass of Blood; in which, you will presently behold little Globes of a differing Frame and Fi|gure, little Fibres, and Streaks of the same Kind.</P>

I must confess I have more than once Attempted to Divide these <HI>Lobuli,</HI> but could not be satisfied of their Appearance like this Figure: The Ex|ternal Surface of the <HI>Lobuli</HI> in the <HI>Foetus</HI> Appear Angular, and are in a Cubical manner plac'd by each other.</P>
<P>A, The Inside of the <HI>Bronchia,</HI> where the Holes for divers of its Ramifications which pass out of it; and the Straight Progress of the Fibres of its Internal Membrane do Appear.</P>
<P>B B, The <HI>Bronchia</HI> divided into lesser Branches; to which the <HI>Lo|buli</HI> are Fastned.</P>
<P>C C, The <HI>Lobuli,</HI> which may be more or less Divided, and are com|pos'd of the <HI>Vesiculae.</HI> The <HI>Vesiculae</HI> as above hinted, are Fram'd by the Extremities of the <HI>Bronchia,</HI> and the Pulmonick Blood-Vessels.</P>
<P>N. B. <HI>The</HI> Lobuli <HI>in this Figure may be observ'd to have the Extre|mities of the Blood-Vessels Branch'd on Them. Each</HI> Vesicula <HI>also has One of the Extremities of the Pulmonick Veins and Arteries Branch'd on it; and without doubt (Conformable to the Extremities of the Blood-Vessels of other Parts) those Vessels also are continued Channels on the</HI> Vesiculae <HI>of the Lungs. Here the Art of Nature is very Extraordina|ry, in Framing the Extremities of these Blood-Vessels of the Lungs so very small, and confining their vast Number in so narrow a Compass, as the Body of the Lungs; for these Pulmonick Blood-Vessels Correspond to those of the whole Field of the Body, in constantly 'Discharging the Blood thro' them, as well as thro' the Heart; whilst Life with perfect Health is maintain'd. And notwithstanding One Half of the Lungs is compleatly Vitiated, (as I have more than once found in Dissecting Morbid Bodies) yet nevertheless the Circulation of the Blood has been still carried on for some time. Tho' in this Case Respiration must not only be very Quick and Attended with no small Difficulty on frequent Occa|sions; but the Heart must also Labour very much to drive the Blood on.</HI></P>

Besides freeing the <HI>Bronchia,</HI> as in <HI>Fig.</HI> 8. there is another way of Demonstrating their Ramifications by pouring of Melted Tin into them; which may be Practis'd in the following Manner. Cut off one Side of the Humane Lungs at the Division of the <HI>Trachea</HI> B B, <HI>Fig.</HI> 8. and with the Feather End of a Goose-Quill so wipe the Inside of the <HI>Bronchia,</HI> by often thrusting it into their Various Ramifications, that at length it no longer comes out wet with the <HI>Mucus</HI> they have in them. The Insides of the <HI>Bronchia</HI> being thus throughly Dri'd with a Feather: In like Manner Anoint them with Linseed Oyl. This done, Tye the Mouth of the Divided <HI>Trachea</HI> to a Tin or Iron Tunnel: This Tunnel must be so plac'd that the Lungs may hang Pendulous and Free; but least their Flaccidity should too much Compress the <HI>Bronchia,</HI> it's conve|nient to pass divers Threads thro' the External Parts of the Lungs, and so Fasten them to the Floor and other convenient Places, that the Lungs may be Extended thereby: In doing of which, be sure you do not distort the Lungs from a direct Pendulous Position; but that the large Trunk of the <HI>Bronchia</HI> remains Perpendicular to the Tunnel. This done, Melt Block-Tin and pour it into the Tunnel; in doing of which, stand at some Distance, least the Conflict which arises from the hot Metal in its meeting with the remaining Moisture in the <HI>Bronchus,</HI> scat|ters it on your Hands, or Face, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> N. B. <HI>If the Metal is made very hot it will so Scorch the First Passages of the</HI> Bronchia <HI>as to Contract them, and thereby Obstruct the rest: Nor must it want Fluidity, least its passing into the smaller Branches is thereby Hindred. The</HI> Bronchus <HI>being thus Injected in the Lungs; lay them in Water, Nine, or Ten Days&punc; till they begin to Putrifie; then Boyl the whole Lungs off the Block-Tin, and you may expect to see it much fuller of Branches than it's Exprest in the</HI> 11<HI>th Figure.</HI></P>

<P>ABCDEFG, _THE <HI>Obliquus Descendens,</HI> or <HI>Declivis</HI> Rais'd: See <HI>App. Fig.</HI> 1.38, 38. It Arises with several partly Fleshy and partly. Tendinous Acute Pro|ductions from the Lower Margins of the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh and Eight Ribs; where its several se|parate Origins lie between the Indentations of the <HI>Serra|tus Major Anticus</HI>; these, for better distinction we call its Former Origin; Besides which, it continues to derive more Heads in like Manner from the Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, and sometimes from the Extremity of the last Bastard-Rib; (<HI>Vid.

<P>1 K K, The <HI>Musculus Transversalis</HI> Rais'd from the <HI>Perito|naum</HI> and Reclin'd Laterally; It derives a Tendinous Origin from the Transverse Processes of the <HI>Vertebrae Lumbares,</HI> and a Fleshy One, from the Cartilaginous Endings of the Ribs, Spine of the <HI>Os Ilium,</HI> and <HI>Ligamentum Pubis</HI>; whence it passes over the Convext Surface of the <HI>Peritonaeum,</HI> composing a Broad Tendon as it Marches under the <HI>Rectus</HI> to its Termi|nation in the whole Length of the <HI>Linea Alba.</HI> When this Muscle and its Partner Act, they press the <HI>Abdomen</HI> directly Inwards.</P>
<P>L M N O P, The <HI>Recti Abdominis</HI>; One remaining <HI>in Sat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> the other being Rais'd: Either of these Muscles derives its Origin from Two of the Cartilages of the True, and One of Bastard Ribs; and in its Descent has Four, sometimes Five Tendinous Intersections O O O O; still Lessening it self be|low the Navel, becomes Tendinous, immediately above the <HI>Os Pubis,</HI> where it's Implanted M: This Bends the Trunk of the Body.</P>
<P>P P, The Under-Side of the <HI>Rectus,</HI> where the Epigastrick and Mammary Blood-Vessels may be seen.</P>
<P>Q, The <HI>Pyramidales,</HI> which derive their Fleshy Origin from the Upper-Part of the <HI>Ossa Pubis,</HI> and Terminate in the <HI>Linea Alba.</HI></P>
<P>R R S S, The <HI>Obliquus Ascendens,</HI> or <HI>Acclavis in Situ</HI>: It A|rises from the Fore-Part of the Spine of the <HI>Os Ilium</HI> and <HI>Li|gamentum Pubis,</HI> whence Mounting with an Order of Fibres Inclining Forewards, Forms a Broad Membranous Thin Ten|don SS, Marching over the <HI>Rectus</HI> to its Implantation in the <HI>Linea Alba</HI>; the Posterior Part of it being Inserted to the Car|tilages of the Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, and Twelfth Ribs. Besides its Office in Compressing the Contents of the Lower Belly; that Part of it that's between the Spine of the <HI>Ilium</HI> and Cartilaginous Endings of the Ribs, is not only Use|ful in drawing the Ribs Downwards in Expiration; but its Fleshy Fibres (Intersecting those of the <HI>Descendens</HI> in the <HI>Ilia</HI>) are also imploy'd in Converting the Trunk of the Body to the same Side, as the <HI>Descendens</HI> above Noted, do's to the Contrary. In the Structure and Reciprocal Cooperations of these Parts of the Ascending and Descending Oblique Muscles, the Art of Nature is very Admirable.</P>
<P>T T V V, The <HI>Peritonaeum</HI> under which the Intestines Ap|pear TT. Tho' the <HI>Peritonaeum</HI> is a Transparent, Thin Mem|brane, yet it consists of divers <HI>Laminae,</HI> and is apparently Double in divers Parts, especially between the Navel and <HI>Os Pubis</HI>: Besides its giving an External Double Integument to all the <HI>Viscera</HI> of the Lower Belly, it Provides still others Investing each <HI>Viscus,</HI> and Helps to compose the <HI>Omentum</HI> and Mesentery. What vast Extensions the Membranes of the <HI>Peritonaeum</HI> are capable of, is well known to those who have seen it Affected with a Dropsie; for in its Duplicature I have often taken out above Fourscore Pints. <HI>Iob Meekren</HI> in his <HI>Ob. Med.</HI> at <HI>Chir.</HI> tells us of a Hundred and Twenty-Five Pints of clear Water contain'd within the Duplicature of the <HI>Pe|ritonaeum</HI>; besides, the Membranes themselves (in the Case now mention'd) were Thickned beyond a Thumbs Breadth, and their Internal Surface furnish'd with many Fleshy Bodies and Water-Bladders, call'd <HI>Hydatides</HI>; so that the whole, when taken out, seem'd to be a Monstrous Mass of Fleshy Matter.</P>

<P>In Dissecting the Morbid Body of a Young Gentle-woman, by the Order of Dr. <HI>Radcliff</HI>: A|mongst other <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of the <HI>Viscera</HI> in the <HI>Abdomen,</HI> I found the <HI>Omentum</HI> so Lessen'd, that at first Sight, it Appear'd doubtful wether there ever had been such a Part fram'd in that Subject; but upon stricter Enquiry, that little Remains of it seem'd to Represent a Heap of small Glands, con|taining a Steotomatous or Suet-like Matter. Nor was this Appearance of these <HI>Steotomae</HI> on the <HI>O|mentum</HI> only; but a Multitude of Little White Bo|dies or Specks (not unlike those of the <HI>Omentum</HI>) plac'd at some small Distance from each other, were spread on the Outward Membrane of the Sto|mach, Intestines, and Internal Surface of the <HI>Pe|ritonaeum.</HI> In this Subject the External Parts of the Small Guts so stuck to each other, that they seem'd to be contain'd in One proper Covering, or not unlike the Brain Cover'd with the <HI>Pia Ma|ter</HI>: so strictly did the Intestines Cleave to each other, that it was not without Violence I could any where Divide them to see the Mesentery: By this means the Peristaltick Motion of the Guts must needs be very much Lessen'd, if not quite Hindred; so that it was no wonder to find their whole Chanel fill'd with Excrements, even from the <HI>Pylorus</HI> to the <HI>Anus</HI>: Besides the Inte|stines had suffer'd Mortifications in divers Parts, whilst other Parts of them were Inflam'd and ve|ry much Thickned: Nor was there any Part of them Appear'd of a Natural Constitution; so general did this Diseas'd-Habit Affect the <HI>Peri|tonaeum,</HI> in all its Expansions. Nor can I omit doing Justice to the Inquisitive Dr. <HI>Radcliff,</HI> who upon frequent Observations of the Symptoms of this Case, left this Prognostick, <HI>That there was scarce any of the</HI> Viscera <HI>of the Lower Belly which had escap'd the Attacks of the Disease:</HI> All which he suppos'd to Arise from a Scrophulous-Ha|bit, as Appear'd by very large Tumified Glands of the Mesentery; of which Two very Remark|able Ones had so Comprest the <HI>Receptaculum Chy|li,</HI> as very little (if any) of the Aliment could at Length pass into the Blood. Whence the Bo|dy became so very much Emaciated, that scarce any thing but Bones Appear'd under the Skin: Nor did I any where see the least Lobe of Fat in the whole Dissection. From what has been above taken Notice of in the <HI>Omentum,</HI> and Surface of the <HI>Peritonaeum,</HI> whether Covering the Inside of the <HI>Abdomen,</HI> or Outsides of the Intestines; It Appears, that when the <HI>Mucus,</HI> which is neces|sary in Lubricating the Intestines, is obstructed; those Parts are Subject to Adhesions, and the Pe|ristaltick Motion of the Latter can no longer be Perform'd, and tho' the Existence of proper Glands for separating this <HI>Mucus</HI> from the Blood do's not offer in Common Dissections, yet it may be hop'd that the frequent Examining of Morbid Bodies, will at one time or other Demonstrate them; which, I am apt to believe, not unlike the Sweat|ing Glands of the Skin, are plac'd at certain Distances, and do discharge their <HI>Mucus</HI> from their Excretory Pores in like Manner; which <HI>Mucus</HI> may joyn with Fatty Exsudations from the <HI>Omen|tum,</HI> &amp;c. and make a Composition necessary for making the Intestines slide on each other. That there is a Slimy Matter besmearing these Parts, may be observ'd in Opening any Large Ani|mal, not Diseas'd, soon after Death. It is well known to the Butchers that this <HI>Mucus</HI> makes the Hands Glib or Smooth; to which End they commonly Use it, so soon as they have Open'd any Animal, by Rubbing their Hands with the Intestines. I know it's commonly suppos'd the Water in an <HI>Ascites</HI> proceeds from a broken Lym|phe-Duct within the Cavity of the <HI>Abdomen</HI>; but it's not unlikely that that Scrosity may at least sometimes Arise from an Exsudation by thos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Glands; since we constantly find the <HI>Peritonaeum</HI> very much Thickned in those Cases.</P>

<P>The <HI>Plexus</HI> of Blood-Vessels Appearing in the Inside of the Stomach, <HI>Fig.</HI> 8. are Remarkable, and their Appearance is owing to the Stagnation of the Blood in them. The Stomach cannot be Wounded into its Cavity, but many of these Ves|sels, especially the Arteries must be Divided, and no small Effusion of Blood must necessarily hap|pen, which if it flows into the Cavity of the Sto|mach, must either be Ejected by Vomit, or pass down the Intestines with the Excrements, if the Patient Survives: An Instance of which lately occur'd, where my Friend Mr. <HI>Goodier</HI> call'd me to see the Patient; who had receiv'd a Wound by a Sword on the Right <HI>Hypochondrium,</HI> which past Obliquely to the <HI>Linea Alba,</HI> imme|diately below the Ensiformal Cartilage: A Vo|mitting of Blood soon follow'd with Syncopes, which denoted the Stomach to be Wounded, not less than a Pound of Coagulated Blood being E|jected by the Mouth so soon as he was brought to his Bed. After some Hours the Vomiting ceas'd, and the Pulse was recover'd which before was very feeble: Nor was it many Days before the Patient Recover'd and could Drink Two or Three Quarts of Strong Drink at a Sitting; what became of him afterwards, we could by no means learn. By this it Appears that Wounds in the Stomach are not always Mortal, tho' they very frequently prove so, as in the Case of one Wounded in like manner with a Sword on the Left <HI>Hypochondrium,</HI> in whom the Stomach was Wounded also; but in this the Contents of the Stomach in no small Quantity, were Discharg'd with a great deal of Blood into the Cavity of the <HI>Abdomen,</HI> as Appear'd on Dissecting his Body. If the Trunk of a Large Artery happens to be Wounded on the Stomach, it is a great Chance but it proves Mortal thro' the Flux of Blood, but if the Wound happens where the Blood-Vessels are Capillary, the Flux of Blood do's not prove Fatal.</P>

<P>R, One of the Lympheducts arising from the Spleen pinn'd out. In Blowing into the <HI>Vena Splenica</HI> of a Castling Calf, I have frequently observ'd the Lympheducts of the Spleen distended with Wind: The like has happen'd by Blowing into the Splenick Artery after tying the Vein, tho' not so immediatly as by Blowing into the Vein. The same <HI>Phaeno|mena</HI> I have observ'd in the <HI>Penis</HI> of a Dog by Blowing into the Veins of that Part. The Accurate <HI>Nuck</HI> in his <HI>Adeno|grap. Curio.</HI> p. 52. tells us by forcibly Blowing into the Sple|nick Artery, he has not only seen divers <HI>Vesiculae</HI> to rise on the Surface of the Spleen; but divers Lymphatick Vessels arising from those <HI>Vesiculae</HI> and distended with Wind also: In the Subsequent Page he takes Notice that the Spermatick Vein of the Testicle being distended with Wind, shews the Lym|pheducts on the <HI>Tunica Vaginalis,</HI> but in Blowing into the Spermatick Artery of that Part, the Lymphe-Ducts are by no Means distended with Wind: By this, it appears the Lym|pheducts of the Spleen, <HI>Penis</HI> and Testicles, do not arise from the Extremities of the Blood-Vessels of those Parts, as the Lympheducts of other Parts seem to do; but that the Ve|nous Chanels of those Parts seem to give the immediate Originations to their Lympheducts.</P>

<P>Among the Opinions hitherto held concerning the Office of the Pancreatick Juice, that of <HI>Brunnerus</HI> seems most pro|bable: That like the <HI>Saliva</HI> it is a Dissolvent or <HI>Menstruum</HI> for a farther Concoction, in Order to Chylification. Nor can I conceive the <HI>Succus Pancreaticus</HI> can Act with any Ho|stility by Way of Fermentation with the Bile and Aliment, as <HI>Franc. Sylvius, Bern. Swalve, Rog. de Gaff,</HI> and <HI>Isbrand de Diemerbroek</HI> apprehend; or that it takes off the Acrimony of the Gall; which Latter, would be to rectifie a Mistake in Nature that might have been avoided in the First Design: Wherefore the <HI>Pancreas</HI> appears to be a Large Salival Gland, or One of the Largest of the Glands of the Intestines, which continually supplies a proportionable Quantity of Liquor for the End above mention'd. Besides, the <HI>Pancreas</HI> has ano|ther as it were accidental Use, (<HI>viz.</HI>) To discharge those Sero|sities from the Blood which we find in taking of Purging Medicines; Or at other Times, when the Blood is disordered so that a <HI>Diarrhaea</HI> happens, the <HI>Pancreas</HI> as well as the Glands of the Intestines are those Strainers which discharge the Vi|tiated Juices from the Mass of Blood.</P>

<P>The Blood-Vessels of the Liver and Gall-Ducts Injected with Wax, and free'd from their Extremities which compose the Glands. This Scheme or Distribution of these Vessels may be prepar'd after the fol|lowing Manner. The whole Liver being taken out with the Trunks of its Blood-Vessels left to it of a convenient length; wash out the Blood from its Vessels by Syringing of warm Water into Them: This done, fill the Blood-Vessels with Spirit of Wine or Alum-Water, or In|ject them with Oyl of Turpentine a little warm'd. After some Hours, dip the whole Liver in hot Water, and Inject Wax of a different Colour into all its Blood-Vessels and Secretory-Ducts; the Arteries being fill'd with Red; the <HI>Vena Porta</HI> with a Dark Colour; the <HI>Vena Ca|va</HI> of a Distinguishable Colour; and the Gall-Ducts with Yellow Wax: This done, free the Liver of its Outward Membranes, and with your Fore-Finger begin to divide the <HI>Lobuli</HI> from each other, by thrusting it thro' the Glandulous Surface even to the Trunks of the Large Blood-Vessels. The <HI>Lobuli</HI> of the Liver being very much divided, dip the whole in warm Water, and with a stubbed Brush, made of the stiffest Hogs-Bristles, begin to Brush off the Glandules of the Liver from the Extremities of the Injected Blood-Vessels.

<P>Hence it Appears the Liver is a Glandulous Body compos'd of Blood-Vessels, Excretory-Ducts, Nerves and Lympheducts. The Vessels which Import Blood into it, are the <HI>Vena Porta</HI> and <HI>Arteria Hepati|ca</HI>; at their Extremities Arise, or are Continued, the Branches of the <HI>Vena Cava</HI>: Nor are the Extremities of the Blood-Vessels of the Liver equally lessen'd like the Veins and Arteries of other Parts, as the above mention'd Experiment of pouring Water only into the <HI>Vena Porta,</HI> and its running out by the <HI>Vena Cava</HI> do's Evince; or by gentle Syringing Water by the Hepatick Arteries, and its easily passing by the <HI>Vena Cava</HI>; so that the Extremities of the Hepatick Blood-Vessels seem to be largely Inosculated with each other, especially the <HI>Vena Porta</HI> with the <HI>Cava.</HI> The Gall-Ducts Arise from the Extremities of the Blood-Vessels, and tho' they Communicate immediately with the Blood-Vessels, yet Liquors convey'd into the <HI>Vena Porta</HI> and the like, do not so rea|dily pass into these Ducts as the other Blood-Vessels; because the <HI>Or|tiolae</HI> in the Sides of the Blood-Vessels whence those Ducts Arise, are much less than the Pore of those Vessels themselves. Besides the Blood-Vessels of the Liver, which are furnish'd with Pores for the Secre|tion of the Gall, there are still other Branches of the same Vessels which Administer a proper Nourishment to the Gland it self. By <HI>the Gland it self.</HI> I mean the <HI>Parietes</HI> of those Vessels which compose the Liver: For I cannot conceive the Liver to be any thing else then a <HI>Compages</HI> of Vessels more or less Distended. As there is a proper Nourishment due to <HI>the Gland it self,</HI> so it is Necessary, that besides its Secretory-Ducts, the Liver should be also furnish'd with Lympheducts, to car|ry off the Redundancy of its Nutritive Juice, continually supplied by the Arteries; but of this elsewhere. The Nerves are necessary in the Liver, as they are in all Parts where Membranes are Useful; not be|cause they Import any Liquor as some conceive, as an Ingredient to the Matter separated; but by the Nerves the Tone of Parts is in a great Measure maintain'd; for if the Nerves are Relaxt, the Parts to which they belong, suffers an <HI>Atrophia,</HI> tho the Blood has its free Accession to the Part as before; but of this also in another Place.</P>
<P>In Dissecting a Morbid Body which before Death was much afflicted with Hypochondriack Pains, I found the Liver very much lessen'd, and its Surface uneven, not unlike a heap of small Bullets. In Dis|secting the Body of a Noble-Man afflicted with the like Pains, I found that Part of the Liver which Appears below the Cartilaginous Endings of the Ribs, of a Livid Colour, and the whole somewhat Lessen'd, the Gall-Bladder very much Contracted, and fill'd with Two or Three small Stones; the <HI>Peritonaeum</HI> on the Parts adjacent being much Thick|ned, and its Blood-Vessels Turgid. In the Body of a Young Lady (reduc'd to a <HI>Marasmus</HI> from a Scrophulous Indisposition) I found the whole Surface of the Liver very Black. In a Person who is now Living, and in tollerable Health, I could Three Years since discover (by feeling the Right <HI>Hypochondrium</HI>) the Lower Part of the Liver ex|ceedingly Tumified and Hard; which is now intirely Vanish't.</P>

<P>The Lacteal-Vessels carry both <HI>Chyle</HI> and <HI>Lympha</HI> Promiscuously, and have a Two-fold Origin; the One from the Extremities of the Arteries; the Other from divers <HI>Ostiolae</HI> in the Cavities of the Guts: The Former Appears not only by Injecting of Mercury by the Arte|ries of the Mesentery D, and its passing into the Lacteals B; but when these Milky-Vessels are not imploy'd in conveying of <HI>Chyle,</HI> they are constantly charg'd with <HI>Lympha</HI>: The Latter Origin of these Milky-Tubes from divers <HI>Ostiolae</HI> in the Cavities of the Guts, Appear in their receiving of <HI>Chyle</HI> from thence. The <HI>Lympha</HI> from the Arteries meets with the <HI>Chyle</HI> at the beginnings of the Lacteal-Vessels, by which means its Progress towards the next Lymphatick Gland is promoted: The <HI>Vasa Lactea primi generis,</HI> Arise with Capillary Branches very much Divided, and become United into large Trunks, in the Mid-way between the Intestine and Lymphatick Gland; and are sometimes again Divided before their Entrance into the <HI>Vesiculae</HI> of the Gland. The <HI>Chyle</HI> and <HI>Lympha</HI> thus re|ceiv'd into the <HI>Vesiculae</HI> of the Mesenterick Glands, there meets with other <HI>Lympha</HI> brought into those <HI>Vesiculae</HI> by the Arteries; whereby the <HI>Chyle</HI> is not only more diluted, but its Ascension towards the <HI>Ve|sica Chyli</HI> is promoted, by its receiving a fresh <HI>Impetus</HI> from the <HI>Lympha</HI> so mixing with it. Thus we may conceive the Progress of <HI>Chyle</HI> towards the <HI>Receptaculum Commune</HI> is carri'd on, by means of the <HI>Lympha</HI> joining with it in its several Stages thither. Nor would the Valves of the Lacteal-Vessels be of any considerable Use, if the <HI>Chyle</HI> did not receive an Additional <HI>Impetus</HI> from the Arteries in their supplying it with fresh <HI>Lympha,</HI> as well in the Lymphatick Glands, as at the Beginnings of the <HI>Vasa Lactea primi generis.</HI></P>

<P>A B C D, The Various Disposition of the Valves in the Cavity of the Intestine; some of them taking up near Two Thirds of the Cir|cumference of the Inside of the Gut, A, Inferior: Others B D, about a Fourth Part; whilst others are Semicircular.</P>
<P>As the Upper Part of the <HI>Duodenum</HI> next the <HI>Pylorus</HI> is Furnish'd with large Valves, so they gradually Decrease in the small Guts as well in Magnitude as Number, as they approach the Lower Parts of those Intestines towards the <HI>Colon</HI>: Hence the <HI>Valvulae Conni|ventes</HI> of the <HI>Duodenum</HI> are very Large; that at the <HI>Pylorus</HI> being Circular; The Valves of the <HI>Iejunum</HI> less; those of the <HI>Ilium</HI> still less; insomuch, that the Lower Part of this Gut next the <HI>Colon</HI> scarce affords any Appearance of them: See <HI>Fig.</HI> 3.</P>
<P>These Valves are compos'd of the Internal Membranes of the Inte|stines, which being much larger then the Exterior, are necessarily laid up in Foldings, and Frame these Parts. These Connivent Valves hinder the quick Descent of the Contents of the Intestines, least the <HI>Chyle</HI> as well as the Excrementitious Parts should escape the Mouth of the Lacteal Veins.</P>

<P>By this Contrivance we may easily conceive how the Excrements, when they have past the Small Guts into the <HI>Colon,</HI> cannot return again: A likeness of which, may be imitated if you take a Piece of Gut and put One End of it into the Neck of a Bottle, and tying the other end of the Gut on the Outside of the Nosel of the Bottle, filling the Bottle with Water by that Gut; and tho' you afterwards turn the Nose of the Bottle downwards, yet no Part of the contain'd Water can come out, till it has so Prest out the end of the Gut in the Bottle that it becomes Inverted. This may serve to give us an <HI>Idea</HI> how it may happen in this Part when the Excrements are rejected by the Mouth in Cholick and Iliack Passions.</P>
<P>G G, The large Valves of the <HI>Colon,</HI> which like those of the small Guts are partly Fram'd by the Loosness of the Internal Membrane of the Gut; and are here in the <HI>Colon</HI> chiefly made by a Corrugation or Folding of the Membranes of the Gut it self, by means of its Ligaments, <HI>Tab.</HI> 40. <HI>Fig.</HI> 1. D, and <HI>Tab.</HI> 54. d d. These Ligaments of the <HI>Colon</HI> are truly Fleshy Fibres, and I am apt to think are capable of contracting themselves and promote the passing on of the Contents of this Gut. When the Ligaments of the <HI>Colon</HI> are divided, the Foldings of it which help to compose its Valves, are loosned, and the whole Gut becomes almost plain without any Inequalities. As the Ligaments of the <HI>Colon</HI> Descend towards the <HI>Rectum</HI> they begin to Expand themselves, and at length Frame an External Membrane for the <HI>Rectum.</HI></P>

<P>A B, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Internal Tunicle of the <HI>Rectum,</HI> which being much larger than the External, necessarily Appears in many Folds in this Po|sition. This Internal Tunick of the <HI>Rectum</HI> is compos'd of a vast Number of Glands, to which divers Blood-Vessels belong; of these, the Veins are considerably Large and are commonly fill'd with Blood, by reason of their Position and the Blood Ascending directly in them; whence it happens they become very much Distended when the Blood do's not readily pass on in their Superior Trunks; or when any sharp Humor Affects this Membrane, these Veins become Tumified, and sometimes discharge their Blood, and are call'd <HI>Haemorrhoides Apertae</HI>; if no Blood flows from those Tumified Veins, they are call'd <HI>Haemor|rhoides Caecae.</HI> The Glandules imploy'd in separating a Matter to Lubri|cate the Inside of the <HI>Rectum,</HI> and cause the Excrements, tho' very much harden'd to pass off easily, are in this Case also very much Swell'd, and a great Quantity of <HI>Mucus</HI> flows from them: Hence the whole Inward Membrane of the <HI>Rectum</HI> becomes much Thickned, and when prest down beyond the Stricture of the Sphincter Muscle of the <HI>Anus,</HI> it is call'd <HI>Procidentia Ani.</HI> Tho' it is commonly suppos'd the Outward Membrane of the <HI>Rectum</HI> as well as the Internal, is driven out in a Common <HI>Procidentia Ani</HI>; yet the following Case seems to evince the contrary, and that it is the Internal Membrane of the <HI>Rectum</HI> only that is then Prolaps'd.</P>
<P>A Gentleman of about Twenty Seven Years of Age, had for se|veral Years been very much Afflicted with the <HI>Haemorrhoides</HI> and a <HI>Procidentia Ani,</HI> who after a sudden Debauch had a great Inflamation and Tumor Affected the <HI>Anus,</HI> attended with great Pain: In the space of Twelve Hours, the Parts about the <HI>Anus</HI> Appear'd of a Livid Co|lour; soon after a Mortification follow'd. The Sphincter Muscle of the <HI>Anus</HI> being Relaxt, a <HI>Procidentia Ani</HI> follow'd; the Prolapsed Inte|stine (being expos'd to the Matter which flow'd from the Adjacent Parts) soon suffer'd Mortification. The Patient after some Weeks recover'd his usual Strength, and in a few Months became perfectly Well. Nor did any inconveniency follow by reason of the Mortification of the Prolapsed Intestine; but on the Contrary, He continued Well, and was free'd not only from the Habitual <HI>Haemorrhoides,</HI> but was after|wards free'd from a <HI>Procidentia Ani.</HI></P>

The <HI>Glandula Renalis</HI> of the Right Side has Arteries from the Emulgent, and <HI>Arteria Phrenica.</HI> The Gland of the Left Kidney has divers small Arteries from the Descending Trunk of the <HI>Arteria Magna</HI>: Their Veins are Two Trunks; One to each Gland, that of the Right Side Arising only from the Gland of the Kidney it self, is Less than the Left, and empties its self into the Ascending Trunk of the <HI>Vena Cava,</HI> above the Emulgent Vein; that of the Left, Arises from the Arteries of the Neighbouring Parts, as well as from those of the Gland it self, and Discharges its self into the Left Emulgent Vein K.</P>

In all the Subjects I have hitherto Examin'd, I have constantly found the Spermatick Arteries to Arise near each other, on the Fore-part of the <HI>Aorta,</HI> as is Exprest on the Left Side, and commonly Describ'd by Anatomists. <HI>Riolan</HI> tells us he has observ'd One of the Spermatick Arteries to Arise from the Emulgent; the like I have more than once thought I had seen, but upon strict Examination, I found it a Branch from the Emul|gent Artery, Descending in the Duplicature of the <HI>Peritonaeum</HI> with the Spermatick Artery and Vein; nor could I observe any Inosculation between it and the Spermatick Artery.</P>
<P>The Spermatick Arteries being very small as they Arise out of the <HI>Aorta,</HI> I don't much wonder that they have escap'd the Eyes of the less Accurate Dissectors, and give them occasion to suppose they were sometimes wanting.</P>

<P>The Nerves of the Kidneys as well as of other Glands in the <HI>Abdomen</HI> furnished with Excretory Ducts, are very few, and their Trunks very small; nor do's any exquisite Pains affect the Kidneys themselves, tho' Stones compos'd of divers Angles are lodg'd in their Glandulous Parts; but the Parts whose Nerves are Complext with those of the Kidneys, suffer most in such Cases. Tho' we reckon the Nerves among the Parts which compose the Glands of the Kidneys, yet we cannot think they are any otherwise Use|ful here, than Subservient to the other Vessels which are immediately imploy'd in the Secretion of the Urine, as the Blood-Vessels and Urinary Tubes; which are the Parts Or|ganiz'd for Separating the Urine from the Blood. Nor are the Lympheducts otherwise imploy'd here than we have elsewhere taken Notice of, as in the Liver; to carry off Part of the <HI>Succus Nutritius</HI> which is constantly convey'd to the Gland it self. How these Parts are Organiz'd, the following Experiments may a little Inform us.</P>
<P>If you Blow into the Emulgent Artery, the Wind will pass into the Vein of that Name, <HI>Vreter,</HI> and Lympheducts; the the like will happen if you Blow either into the <HI>Vreter</HI> or Emulgent Vein. If you Inject Mercury, all these Vessels will in like Manner be Distended. If you Syringe Water into the Emulgent Arteries, it will at first pass the Veins and <HI>Vreter</HI>; but if you continue Injecting it for any time, the whole Kidney will at Length become Distended, and the Water will no longer pass off again by those Vessels. Hence it Appears the Blood consisting of Globular Bodies, (Propor|tionated to the Magnitude of the Extremities of the Vessels moving in the <HI>Serum</HI>) readily pass on by a Succession of <HI>Glo|bules</HI> still driving others before them; whilst the Urinary Tubes (as they Arise with small Orifices from the Sides of the Extremities of the Blood-Vessels) receive the Thinner or Urinous Part of the Blood, and Discharge it into the <HI>Pelvis</HI> of the Kidney. In the Body of a Person of the First Rank I lately Dissected, I found the Left Kidney Large, its Texture very Loose; and by Blowing into its <HI>Vreter,</HI> the Emulgent Vein very suddenly became Distended: In this Person among other Disorders, he had near Twenty Years before his Death, very Feculent Urine: If his Urine was Evaporated by Heat as in a Spoon over a Candle, its Fe|culent Part became still thicker; by which it appear'd the Nutritious Parts of the <HI>Serum</HI> of the Blood as well as the Urinous Part, past off by the too great Laxity of the Uri|nous Pores in the Sides of the Blood Vessels in the Kidney.</P>

<P>C C, The Bladder of Urine cover'd with Fat, as it is commonly found in Humane Bodies.</P>
<P>The Bladder of Urine may be said to be a Dila|tation of the <HI>Ureters</HI>; the intimate Structure of the Membrane of both agree, except that the Muscular Fibres of the Bladder are Stronger and Larger than those of the <HI>Ureters</HI>; the Superior and Largest of them embracing the Bladder, like a Hand, as <HI>Spigelius</HI> compares them; the Internal are Less, and Decussate the Superior with Various Angles: Some Anatomists reckon these among the Muscles, and call them <HI>Detrusores Urinae.</HI> The Glands of the Bladder of Urine are also Larger than those of the <HI>Ureters,</HI> and are frequently Tumified as well as the Fibres in Diseas'd Bodies, especially in those who for some time have been Afflicted with a Stone in this Part, the Sides of the Bladder have been very much Thickned; and by Compressing them a <HI>Mucus</HI> may be seen to Arise from its Internal Surface, thro' divers <HI>Ostio|la</HI> or Excretory Ducts. The Bladder is Situated in the <HI>Hypogastrium</HI> in the Duplicature of the <HI>Peri|tonaeum</HI>: When it's Inflated in the Body, it exact|ly fill's that Cavity of the <HI>Abdomen,</HI> call'd the <HI>Pelvis</HI>; its Upper Part is Suspended by the <HI>U|rachus,</HI> which in some Animals would be liable to fall on its Neck and hinder the Evacuation of Urine.</P>
<P>The Use of the Bladder is to Receive the Urine from the <HI>Ureters,</HI> and Contain it till the Time of Excretion; whence it's Squees'd out partly by its own Carnous Fibres, but chiefly by the Mus|cles of the <HI>Abdomen.</HI></P>
<P>D, That Part of the <HI>Urethra</HI> that is Bended under the <HI>Os Pubis</HI> in its Proper Situation, and is plac'd between the Sphincter Muscle of the <HI>Anus</HI> and <HI>Prostatae.</HI> This Part of the <HI>Urethra</HI> is lia|ble to be Wounded, and sometimes Perforated by too hastily Introducing the <HI>Conductor</HI> into the Bladder, after an Incision is made in the <HI>Peri|naeum</HI> in Cutting for the Stone; whereby the O|perator afterwards thrusts his <HI>Forceps</HI> between the Bladder of Urine and <HI>Rectum.</HI> This Inad|vertency I am perswaded is very often Practis'd among the Pretenders to <HI>Lythotomy,</HI> and fre|quently proves fatal to the Patient. One would think it was hardly possible a Man in his Senses, and but tollerably acquainted with Anatomy, could commit such Errors; yet of this I have met with more than one Instance, when being call'd to Dissect the Deceased, in whom such O|perators have been so Unfortunate as to leave the Stone still in the Bladder.</P>

<P>A, The <HI>Arteria Spermatica</HI> continued from a Portion of the Descending Trunk of the <HI>Arteria Magna</HI>: I can't but suspect this Part of the Figure to be Erroneous, since in the many Subjects I have always observ'd the Origin of the Spermatick Artery to be very Small, even much Smaller than its Inferior Trunk; insomuch, that its Ca|vity Arising from the <HI>Arteria Magna,</HI> would scarce admit the Smallest Probe commonly us'd, it being but just Capacious enough to receive a Large Hogs Bristle.</P>

<P>E E, The Valves of the Spermatick Vein which look from below Upwards, and prevent the Descent of the Blood in that Vessel. Should it be askt why the Spermatick Veins in Humane Bodies, and the Arteries in Quadrupedes should have a Tortuous Progress towards the Testicles; and <HI>Vice Versa</HI> the Humane Spermatick Arteries and Veins of Quadrupedes should pass Straight? We answer, Tho' the Separation of the <HI>Semen</HI> in the Testicle is after the Manner of that of other Li|quors in Conglomerate Glands, yet we constantly find in all Animals, that the Arteries of the <HI>Testes</HI> are Propagated from their Large Trunks at a considerable Distance from them; and those of the Conglomerate Glands, are always supply'd with Blood-Vessels from the next Neighbouring-Branch: And this Practice in Nature we can't at present Account for otherwise, than that the Blood in the Testicles should not pass with that Velocity as it do's in other Glands; else what should be the Design of those many Turnings and Windings made in the Spermatick Arteries of most, if not all Quadrupedes? But that every An|gle of their Contortions should take off the <HI>Im|petus</HI> of the Impell'd Blood from the Heart. But the Subject of our present Animadversions here, offers an Objection. Why than are the Sperma|tick Arteries in Humane Bodies Straight, when their Progress is towards a Perpendicular Descent, upon the Account of the Erect Position of the Body? We answer, That the Descending Progress of the Blood might be a very good Argument of its Enjoying a freer Accession to the <HI>Testes</HI>; but we constantly Observe in all Humane Bodies, that the Spermatick Arteries are (as we have Inti|mated above) very Small at their Originals from the <HI>Arteria Magna,</HI> which is a sufficient Impe|diment to any great <HI>Impetus</HI> of the Blood from the Great Artery: Nor was this Contrivance in Nature necessary in Quadrupedes, because it would be an Impediment in them in providing that Requisite Stock of <HI>Semen</HI> to Impregnate the Female with her Numbers; or in regard a greater Proportion of <HI>Semen</HI> was in them necessary on the Account of the Length of the <HI>Cornua Uteri,</HI> which it must first pass thro', before it can Arrive at the <HI>Fallopian Tubes</HI> and <HI>Ovaria</HI>: Whence it is, that the <HI>Testes</HI> of Quadrupedes are much Larg|er in Proportion, than the Humane. But why the Humane Spermatick Veins are thus Divided and Inosculated with each other, when those of Qua|drupedes are Straight and fewer Trunks, is Ac|countable from their Positions; those of Men being towards a Perpendicular Ascent to convey the refluent Blood; and those of Quadrupedes near Horizontal. From hence the Necessity of making one of these Blood-Vessels Varicous, do's Appear, especially the Humane Spermatick Veins; which, if had the Arteries been also, as in Qua|drupedes; the Spaces or Perforations in the Mus|cles of the <HI>Abdomen</HI> for their Egress, must have been so Large, as that the Intestines would have been continually liable to an Extrusion.</P>

The Experiments I have made in Examining the <HI>Testes,</HI> convince me that the Extremities of their Blood-Vessels which Com|pose their Glands, are much Less or more Tender than those of other Parts; whence it is, if you Inject Mercury by the Spermatick Artery, it will not pass back again by the Vein, as in the Kid|neys and other Glands; but the Mercury upon pushing it Forwards, will sooner break the Extre|mities of these Vessels, and get out in the <HI>Tunica Albuginea,</HI> and Extend the whole Stone than re|turn again by the Spermatick Vein: Nor could I ever find the Lympheducts fill'd with Mercu|ry, upon Injecting it into the Spermatick Artery; but by Blowing into the Vein of that Name, the Lympheducts soon become Distended, as <HI>Nuck</HI> has also taken Notice in his <HI>Adenographia Curio|sa,</HI> Pag. 53.</P>

<P>The Muscles of the <HI>Anus</HI> and <HI>Penis in Situ.</HI></P>
<P>A, B, C, D, The <HI>Musculus Sphincter Ani</HI>: The Figure and Situation of this Muscle is here well Exprest; tho' Part of it be frequently divided in Opening a Fistulous <HI>Sinus</HI> of the <HI>Anus,</HI> yet the remaining Part of it is sufficient for its pro|per Office of retaining the <HI>Faeces.</HI></P>
<P>E, E, The <HI>Levatores Ani</HI>: The Origination of which Muscles are best seen after dividing the <HI>Ossa Pubis,</HI> to take out the Bladder of Urine with the <HI>Penis</HI>: They spring from the Internal Parts of the last mention'd Bones, and descend close over the <HI>Corpus Glandulosum</HI> or <HI>Prostatae.</HI> The Hinder Parts of these Muscles derive their Broad, Thin, Fleshy Be|ginnings from the <HI>Ossa Ischii</HI> and <HI>Os Sacrum</HI>; from these Places their Fibres descend to their Implantation, into the Lower End of the <HI>Intestinum Rectum</HI> in the <HI>Anus.</HI></P>
<P>These Muscles have a Two-fold Office; first in drawing up the <HI>Anus,</HI> least it should be too much press'd upon by the <HI>Foeces</HI>; secondly they Compress the <HI>Prostatae</HI> and <HI>Vesicu|lae Seminales in Coitu,</HI> in Order to discharge their Contents or <HI>Semen</HI> into the <HI>Vrethra.</HI></P>
<P>F, F, The <HI>Directores Penis</HI> or <HI>Erectores</HI>: They arise Fleshy from the Lower Margin of the <HI>Ossa Pubis</HI> where they are join'd to the <HI>Ischii</HI>; whence they ascend to their Implanta|tions near the Beginnings of the <HI>Corpora Cavernosa Penis.</HI></P>
<P>The Position of these Muscles renders them capable of pulling the <HI>Penis</HI> Inwards and Downwards; but by Means of a Ligament arising from the <HI>Ossa Pubis,</HI> which is fastned to the Upper Part of the <HI>Penis,</HI> they have a different Ef|fect by drawing the <HI>Penis</HI> somewhat Upwards and Nearer the <HI>Pubes,</HI> whereby the great Vein on the <HI>Dorsum Penis</HI> is Comprest, and the Erection of the <HI>Penis</HI> Promoted.</P>
<P>G, G, The <HI>Corpora Cavernosa Penis.</HI></P>
<P>H, H, The <HI>Musculus Accelerator Vrinae</HI> covering the Bulb of the Cavernous Body of the <HI>Vrethra</HI>: This derives its Origin from the Upper-part of the <HI>Vrethra</HI> L, <HI>Fig.</HI> 1. on both Sides, and encompassing the Bulb, meets on its Inferior Part, but after a considerable Progress on that Part of the <HI>Vrethra</HI> in the <HI>Perinaeum</HI>; this Muscle divides its self and makes Two Tendinous Insertions on both Sides the <HI>Corpora Cavernosa Penis,</HI> as is Exprest in this Figure.</P>
<P>Besides the Offices commonly ascrib'd to this Muscle of compressing the <HI>Vrethra</HI> in driving out the Remains of Urine, and promoting the Ejaculation of the <HI>Semen,</HI> both which Actions are chiefly done by the last describ'd Parts of it, em|bracing the <HI>Vrethra.</HI> It also Assists the <HI>Musculi Directores</HI> in promoting the Erection of the <HI>Penis,</HI> by compressing the Bulb whose contain'd Blood is then driven towards the <HI>Glans,</HI> in a greater Quantity than can immediately be discharg'd by the Veins of the Bulb; the <HI>Glans</HI> thereby suddenly becomes distended: But the Vigorous Action of this Muscle not con|tinuing long, the Veins of the Bulb which were then com|press'd, are again at Liberty to discharge the retain'd Blood, and the <HI>Glans</HI> suddenly Sinks: Whence it comes that the <HI>Glans</HI> is not always duly extended, when the <HI>Corpora Cavernosa Pe|nis</HI> are Erected.</P>
<P>This Part of the Bulb and <HI>Accelerator</HI> Muscle, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are di|vided in <HI>Lithotomy,</HI> or Cutting for the Stone in the Bladder; Whence it happens that the Cicatrice of these Parts after|wards, often hinders a compleat Extention of the <HI>Glans Penis</HI> in an Erection. The like happn'd in a Patient I was not long since call'd to, who had a Fistulous <HI>Sinus</HI> in the <HI>Pe|rinaeum,</HI> in whom I found this Bulbous Part of the Caver|nous Body of the <HI>Vrethra</HI> very much Indurated: Upon Enquiry he told me, <HI>When his</HI> Penis <HI>was Erected, the</HI> Glans <HI>remained shrivelld and no Ways Extended</HI>: Nor could the <HI>Cor|pus Cavernosum Vrethrae</HI> be extended, and therefore he could by no Means Ejaculate the <HI>Semen</HI> at the Time of Erection; but the <HI>Semen</HI> often came with the Urine.</P>
<P>I, The <HI>Musculus Transversalis Penis</HI> on the Left Side, that of the Right not being Letter'd; It Arises from the Knob of the <HI>Os Ischium</HI> immediately below the Origination of the <HI>Musculus Director,</HI> and passes transversly to the Superior Part of the Bulb of the Cavernous Body of the <HI>Vrethra.</HI></P>

<P><HI>De Graaf de Mul. Organ. Generat. Inseroi.</HI> Cap.

The like is taken Notice of by <HI>Spigellius,</HI> Lib. VIII. Cap. XXIII. As the Time of the <HI>Partus</HI> draws in, the <HI>Os Tincae</HI> still becomes Larger, and the Glutinous Matter encreases, whereby it pre|vents Abortions by opposing any Extrusion of the <HI>Chorion,</HI> notwithstanding the Efforts made by the <HI>Foetus</HI> from within towards the Time of the <HI>Partus</HI>: This Glutinous Matter also hinders the Intrusion of any Thing from the <HI>Vagina</HI> after Impregnation.

<P>_THE Cavity of the <HI>Ab|domen</HI> after its <HI>Viscera</HI> are remov'd.</P>
<P>A A, The Common and Proper Integuments of the <HI>Abdomen,</HI> Dis|sected and turn'd Aside.</P>
<P>B B, The <HI>Diaphrag|ma in Situ</HI>: It Arises Tendinous on the Right Side from the Third, Second and First <HI>Vertebra</HI> of the Loins, and last of the Back (H); On the Left, from the First of the Loins, and Last <HI>Vertebra</HI> of the Back; hence Ascending with Fleshy Fibres on each Side running Straight, but towards the Middle they pass somewhat Curvedly, Intersect|ing each other near the <HI>Oesophagus</HI> (D), do as it were Embrace it: After which they become Ten|dinous and join with its Upper-part (F), which Arises Thin and Fleshy from the <HI>Os Pectoris</HI> or <HI>Sternum</HI>: Its Lateral Parts derive their Origins from the Cartilaginous Endings of the Ribs and Lower Margin of the Last Rib (G) on each Side. From these Parts the Fleshy Fibres of the Dia|phragm (like Lines drawn from a Circumference towards a Center) pass to its Middle Part, where its Tendinous Fibres are Intercussated with each other and Exhibit a <HI>Rete.</HI> Besides its Perforation for the <HI>Oesophagus</HI> in its Fleshy Part, it has ano|ther in its Tendinous one, no less remarkable, to Transmit the <HI>Vena Cava</HI> (C). Its Double Origin at the <HI>Vertebrae</HI> of the Loins gives Way to the Descending Trunk of the <HI>Arteria Magna</HI> (E), and Two Ascending of the <HI>Ductus Chyliferus</HI> and <HI>Vena Azygos</HI> on the Left Side. In Expiration this Lower Surface of the Diaphragm is Concave towards the <HI>Abdomen</HI> (as here Exprest), and its Upper, Convex towards the <HI>Thorax.</HI> In Inspira|tion it Approaches towards a Plane next the <HI>Tho|rax</HI> as well as the <HI>Abdomen.</HI> If the <HI>Viscera</HI> of the Lower Belly are taken out in Vivisection, the Inferior Surface of the Diaphragm will Appear Convex in Inspiration, and more especially if Two small Wounds should be made into the Ca|vities on both Sides the <HI>Thorax,</HI> so that the Am|bient Air may Rush into its Cavities on each Side the <HI>Mediastinum</HI>; the <HI>Diaphragma</HI> than will still remain Concave towards the <HI>Thorax,</HI> and Convex towards the <HI>Abdomen.</HI> Nor can Respiration be perform'd, except the Wounds in the <HI>Thorax</HI> are Large enough to Discharge its contain'd Air free|ly again; whence it happens that Wounds in the <HI>Thorax</HI> may suddenly prove Mortal, when no contain'd Part is Injured. But in such Cases the External Wounds ought to be Enlarg'd that the Air may have a Free Egress, which the Perforation of the Skin and Muscles not corresponding, Hin|ders; but this seldom happens, because both Sides of the <HI>Thorax</HI> are not very liable to be Wounded in such Manner at the same time. If one Side of the <HI>Thorax</HI> only is Wounded, the External Air ought by all means to be Pent out, tho' the Pa|tient is not Incident to be Suffocated; because the other Side of the Lungs are not Incommoded, yet the Intruded Air ought to be let out, tho' it only Hinders the Dilatation of one Side of the Lungs. In Dissecting a Morbid Body which had one Side of the Diaphragm very much Deprest, (by the contain'd Water on the same Side of the <HI>Thorax</HI>) I found the Lungs on that Side in great Part Mortified, and the Blood Stagnated; there being some Air also broke out from the <HI>Bronchia</HI> into the Cavity of the <HI>Thorax,</HI> which compleatly Hinder'd Inspiration on that Side of the Lungs.</P>

It also hastens the Discharge of those Liquors contain'd in the Excretory Ducts of those many Large Glands within the Cavity of the <HI>Abdomen,</HI> as the Liver, Pancreas, Kid|neys, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Not to mention many other contin|gent Offices of this Part; as in the Exclusion of the <HI>Foeces</HI> and Urine in both Sexes, and <HI>Foetus</HI> in Women, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>F F F, The Veins of the <HI>Uterus</HI> very much Dilated.</P>
<P>As the Time of the Birth draws on, so the Thickness of the <HI>Uterus</HI> is still said to encrease, and the Trunks of the Veins become still more and more distended. The Trunks of the Arteries of the <HI>Uterus</HI> are also at that Time proportionably Dilated. These Blood-Vessels of the <HI>Uterus</HI> are inosculated with those of the <HI>Placenta,</HI> as may appear by the Passing of Mercury from One to the Other, so that if you pour it into the Hypogastrick Arteries of the Mother, it will pass into the Veins of the <HI>Placenta</HI> as well as those of the <HI>Uterus</HI>: And on the contrary the Mercury will pass from the Arteries of the <HI>Placenta</HI> to the Hypogastrick Veins of the Mother, as also into the Veins of the <HI>Placenta.</HI> Hence it appears there is a Circulation of Blood between the Mother and <HI>Foetus</HI>; and it seems as if the Blood-Vessels of both did Germinate and Inosculate with each other. But this requires too much Speculation for my Occasions to admit of a farther Enquiry at present. There|fore I shall here only speak of some <HI>Phaenomena</HI> which offer in Child-bearing.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Fundus Uteri</HI> remain Tumifi'd after Child-bearing or an Abortion, the Flux of Blood proves very great and sometimes destructive to the Mother, be|cause the <HI>Uterus</HI> do's not Collapse, and by that Means close the Orifices of the Broken-off Arteries of the Mother.

<HEAD>THE FIFTY-EIGHTH TABLE.</HEAD>
<P>A,_SHEWS the External Convext Surface of the <HI>Placenta Uterina</HI> free'd from the <HI>Vterus.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Placenta</HI> is compos'd of Blood-Vessels of both Kinds deriv'd from the Mother and <HI>Foetus,</HI> which Frame Glandulous Bodies and Fibres, to which divers Succiferous Ducts are Inserted, says <HI>Bidloo.</HI></P>
<P>These Succiferous Tubes and Glands I must confess never yet Occur'd to my Observation in Dissection, nor do I at present know who besides Pro|fessor <HI>Bidloo</HI> mentions them: Here he only Names them among other Vessels of the <HI>Placenta,</HI> and in <HI>Tab.</HI> 66. he Represents divers Succife|rous Ducts in the Umbilical Rope; nor do's he any where mention what Juice these Ducts of the <HI>Placenta</HI> carry, or those of the Umbilical Rope; wherefore I shall here Venture to add my Conjecture, and so proceed. If any Liquor Transcolated by Glands of the <HI>Placenta</HI> is convey'd towards the <HI>Foetus,</HI> it is most likely that contain'd in the <HI>Amnios</HI>; and tho' we have Observ'd <HI>Tab.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">5. divers Glands plac'd at Various Distances in the <HI>Amnios</HI> of Cows, yet we can by no means think they are sufficient to supply that Membrane with a Necessary Quantity of Liquor for Entertaining the <HI>Foetus</HI>: And since we have Observ'd divers Tubercles on the Surface of the Um|bilical Rope, mention'd in the following Table (P). We cannot tell how to reconcile those <HI>Phae|nomena,</HI> but by supposing the greatest Part of the Liquor of the <HI>Amnios,</HI> is convey'd thither from the Glands of the <HI>Placenta,</HI> by the Ducts of the Umbilical Rope.</P>
<P>This Liquor of the <HI>Amnios</HI> not only serves to Facilitate the Motions of the <HI>Foetus,</HI> but towards the time of the <HI>Partus</HI> it is partly receiv'd by its Mouth, and is convey'd into its Stomach and Guts, and Administers Chyle to its Lacteals and Thoracick-Duct; which is receiv'd by the Subclavian Vein of the <HI>Foetus,</HI> and there joins with the Blood Transmitted from the Mother to the <HI>Foetus.</HI> Thus the Stomach and Intestines as well as the Common Passages of Chyle and <HI>Lympha</HI> of the <HI>Foetus</HI> are im|ploy'd in the <HI>Uterus</HI>; by which means those Channels are the more readily made use of, soon after the Birth, when the Infant has no other way of receiving its Nourishment but by the Mouth. The Chyle thus mingling with the Blood of the <HI>Foetus,</HI> so Thins it, that its Circulation may be the bet|ter carried on by the weak <HI>Systole</HI> of its Heart; whereby its Blood may be again Discharg'd into the Hypogastrick Veins of the Mothers <HI>Uterus.</HI> The Liquor of the <HI>Amnios</HI> has another, as it were Ac|cidental Use, in Lubricating the <HI>Vagina</HI> at the Time of the <HI>Partus</HI>; the <HI>Foetus</HI> then breaking the <HI>Amnios</HI> by its Strugling, its Contents flow by the <HI>Pudendum,</HI> which they commonly call <HI>The Breaking of the Water.</HI></P>
<P>B B, The Furrows or Clifts of the <HI>Placenta,</HI> which more or less Result from its Tubercles.</P>
<P>C C, The Tubercles of the <HI>Placenta,</HI> which are Thick and Large towards their Center, and Less towards their Circumference.</P>
<P>D D, The <HI>Chorion</HI> or External Membrane Involving the <HI>Foetus,</HI> Varigated with Blood-Vessels Springing from the <HI>Placenta,</HI> (and Umbilical Rope in some Animals) and the <HI>Vterus</HI> it self in Hu|mane Bodies.</P>

<P>The Existence of this Membrane is much Doubted of in Humane Bodies. I must confess I never met with a Subject in which I could Discover it. The Midwives take Notice of a <HI>By Water,</HI> as they call it, near the Time of the <HI>Partus</HI>; which I am apt to think is the Contents of this Membrane breaking forth, which often happens some Weeks before the Birth, and no ill Consequence follows.</P>

<P>_THE <HI>Abdomen</HI> of a Female <HI>Foetus</HI> Seven Months after Conception open'd, to shew the Progress of the Umbilical Vessels towards its Navel.</P>
<P>A, The Umbilical Rope suspended.</P>
<P>C C, The Common and Proper Integuments of the <HI>Abdomen</HI> turn'd aside.</P>
<P>E G, The Umbilical Vein entering the Liver at a Fissure near the Mid|dle of its lower Part, whence the <HI>Ligamentum Suspensorium Hepatis</HI> may be here seen continu'd to the Ensiformal Cartilage and Diaphragm.</P>
<P>F, The Liver, which in Proportion to the rest of the <HI>Viscera</HI> in a <HI>Foetus,</HI> is very large, extending it self to both <HI>Hypochondria.</HI></P>
<P>The Magnitude of the Liver in a <HI>Foetus</HI> rather Proceeds from a greater Quantity of Blood car|ri'd into it by the <HI>Vena Umbilicalis,</HI> than any proper Office it then Executes: This Disproportion of the Liver do's not remit in an Infant, but seems to continue in some Measure, till they are Four or Five Years Old: Hence it is, that the Intestines of Infants and Children are suppli'd with more Gall than those of riper Years; and are therefore incident to be gript much in the lower Belly, and attended with a <HI>Diarrhoea.</HI> Nor do I in this conceive Nature has any Ways committed a Mistake; for sure it is very necessary some notable Discharge ought to be made of the Serosities in Children, whilst their Limbs are not able to perform those Exercises which promote Perspi|ration and the like.</P>
<P>The Blood imported into the Liver by the Umbilical Vein meets with a contrary Current of Blood in the <HI>Vena Porta,</HI> as it passes the <HI>Sinus</HI> to the <HI>Vena Cava</HI>; whereby some of the Capillary Vessels about the Liver or Umbilical Vein are frequently broken, and the Blood is discharg'd in|to the Cavity of the <HI>Abdomen.</HI></P>
<P>In an Abortive Humane <HI>Foetus</HI> (after Seven Months Conception) I found the <HI>Abdomen</HI> with|out any Integuments; its <HI>Viscera</HI> being expos'd, as in this Figure: Nor could I find so much as any Part of the <HI>Peritonaeum</HI> that had cover'd them; which I suspected might have been broken. The Left Kidney also was expos'd to View. Besides this, the Top of the Skull was wanting, and in|stead of it a Membrane distended with Grumous Blood. Very little Part of the Brain appear'd on the <HI>Basis</HI> of the Skull, but it was chiefly contain'd in the <HI>Specus</HI> of the <HI>Vertebrae</HI> of the Neck. The Left Eye and Ear were wanting, as well as the Nose. A Ligament of about an Inch in Length, fasten'd the great Toe of the Right Foot to the Bone of the upper Jaw. The Left Arm was want|ing; and instead of it, something like a Hand was fram'd, seeming to have a Thumb and Fore-Finger: This was ty'd by Two Ligaments; the one springing from the <HI>Carpus</HI> was short, and fasten'd it to the <HI>Scapula</HI>; the other Ligament was longer, and arising between those Parts which repre|sented a Finger and Thumb, was sixt to the <HI>Basis</HI> of the Skull on the same Side.</P>
<P>Upon opening the <HI>Thorax</HI> I found the Cone of the Heart pointing upwards; its <HI>Basis</HI> towards the Diaphragm. And both Extremities of the Bastard Ribs of the Left Side resting on their <HI>Vertebrae.</HI></P>

<P>C, D, F, G, E, H, I, K, Their Tendinous Extremities: When any Additional Matter passes into these Fleshy Fibres and Distends them, the Breadth which they thereby Acquire, necessarily Shortens them, and their Tendinous Ex|tremities fixt to the most Movable Part, is pull'd nearer the more Stable. This Additional Matter we take to be the Blood, which is constantly in a Progressive Motion, as well in the Capillary as in the Larger Trunks of its Vessels; and when a sudden Stop or Retardation of it happens in the Trunks of the Veins in Muscles, the Blood in the Extremi|ties of those Veins necessarily breaks forth by their Colla|teral Pores, and passes into the Cells of the Fleshy Fibres; whence an Intumescence of those Fibres follows, and their Length is necessarily Lessen'd. When I say the Blood as a <HI>Pondus</HI> Acts in Muscular Motion: I mean that as a Fluid, it Insinuates where ever there is a Passage, and necessarily Di|stends the Cells of the Fleshy Fibres, when it is push'd on by the Arteries, and d
o's not readily return by the Veins. This Structure of the Extremities of the Blood-Vessels in Muscles, renders the Appearance of their Fleshy Fibres Red or more Bloody than other Parts, which are Furnish'd with a far greater Number of Blood-Vessels than the Muscles; as the <HI>Pancreas,</HI> Salival Glands, and Cortical Part of the Brain. The Liver, Spleen, and Kidneys have their Colour, from the Number and Magnitude of their Blood-Vessels always fill'd with Blood. The Question is, How the Venose Chan|nels are so instantaneously Comprest that the Refluent Blood is Retarded? Till Enquiry and Observation affords me something to the purpose, I shall say no more; choosing to Recommend such Speculations, to those who have more Ta|lent and Time to bestow on them.</P>

<P>We come next to the Muscles of the <HI>Artus</HI> or Limbs; and First to those of the Whole Arm, by which is understood all the Part fastned to the Upper-part of the Trunk of the Body, Arising at the Shoulder. <HI>Fig.</HI> 8. The Arm in com|mon Acceptation, is taken to be all that Part between the Neck of the Shoulder-blade and Wrist (H). The Arm strictly speaking, is that Part between the Shoulder and Elbow (B), which, otherwise, is call'd <HI>Humerus</HI>: It consisting of One Bone, and is call'd <HI>Os Humeri,</HI> the Shoulder-bone, or Arm|bone. The Lower-part of the Arm from the Elbow (B) to the Wrist (H), is call'd the Cubit, and consists of Two Bones, call'd <HI>Vlna</HI> and <HI>Radius</HI>; we shall elsewhere speak of the Articulations of these and other Bones. As some have Comprehended the Shoulder or Arm, Cubit, Hand, and Fingers under the Title of the Whole Arm; so others have call'd all those together, <HI>The Whole Hand.</HI> The Hand in com|mon Acceptation, is meant all that Part below the Cubit, or Wrist, consisting of Four Fingers (M N O P) and a Thumb (L). The Palm (C) call'd <HI>Vola Manus</HI>; opposite to which is the Back of the Hand or <HI>Dorsum Manus.</HI></P>

<P>E, The <HI>Subscapularis</HI> or <HI>Immersus</HI>: It fills the Internal Concave Part of the <HI>Scapula,</HI> Arising Fleshy from its whole <HI>Basis</HI> and Superior and Inferior <HI>Costa</HI> Internally, and in its Progress Lessens its self according to the Configuration of the <HI>Scapula,</HI> and Running over its Juncture; it's Inserted to the Neck of the <HI>Os Humeri</HI> in a Semicircular Manner. This draws the Arm to the Trunk of the Body, and is made Use of by the Bag-pipe-Player to Compress his Bellows under his Arm.</P>

<P>C, D, E, The <HI>Biceps Externus</HI> or <HI>Gemellus</HI>: It has a Twofold Origin; the First (C) or Superior, Arises Tendinous from the Superior Part of the Inferior <HI>Costa</HI> of the <HI>Scapula</HI> Internally, and Marching out from between the Two Round Muscles, soon Grows Fleshy, and joins with its Second Be|ginning (D), which Arises Broad and Fleshy from the Upper and Back-part of the <HI>Os Humeri</HI> under the <HI>Deltoide</HI> Muscle; soon after the Conjunction of these Two Heads, it becomes Externally Tendinous (E), and is so Im|planted to the Superior and External Part of the <HI>Ulna,</HI> call'd <HI>Olecranum, Ancon,</HI> or the Elbow. Its Office is to Extend the Cubit, which it do's the more Advantageously, by how much the more it is Intertext with Various Orders of Fibres.

<P>_SOME of the Muscles Employ'd in Bending the Fingers and <HI>Carpus.</HI></P>
<P>A, B, C, D, E, The <HI>Per|foratus,</HI> or <HI>Sublimis,</HI> or <HI>Flexor Secundi Interno|dii Digitorum,</HI> Dissected from its Original: It A|rises partly Fleshy and partly Tendinous, from the Internal Extuberance of the <HI>Os Humeri,</HI> be|tween the <HI>Flexores Carpi</HI>: It has also a Disgre|gated Fleshy Origination from the Fore-part of the <HI>Radius,</HI> between the <HI>Pronator Radii Teres,</HI> and <HI>Flexor Pollicis Magnus,</HI> soon Composing a Fleshy Belly, Lessens its self where it begins to Divide into Two Parts, each of which being again Subdivided, makes Four Roundish Tendons (c c c c), included in their Proper Mucilaginous Membranes, and pass under the Annular Liga|ment of the <HI>Carpus</HI> thro' the Palm: Near the First Internode of the Fingers, each of these Tendons are again Divided or Perforated (E), to admit the Tendons of the following Muscle to pass thro' 'em; these Tendons joining again, are Inserted to the Superior Parts of the Second Bone of each Finger.</P>
<P>F, G, H, I, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The <HI>Perforans in Situ</HI>; it's also call'd <HI>Profundus</HI> and <HI>Flexor Tertii Internodii Di|gitorum</HI>: It Arises Fleshy from near Two Thirds of the Superior and Fore-part of the <HI>Ulna,</HI> and Internal Edge of the <HI>Radius,</HI> as also from the Li|gament between the <HI>Radius</HI> and <HI>Ulna</HI>; it be|coming a Large Thick-Bellied Muscle; it Grows Outwardly Tendinous before it passes over the <HI>Pronator Radii Quadratus,</HI> where Dividing in|to Four Round Tendons, which March under those of the <HI>Perforatus</HI> (last Describ'd) beneath the Transverse Ligament of the <HI>Carpus,</HI> where the Lumbrical Muscles M, M, M, M, are said to Arise: These Tendons pass the Palm H, H, H, H, and run thro' the Tendons of the former Muscle and proceeding over their Extremities, Termi|nate in the Superior and Fore-part of the Third Bone of each Finger I I I I.</P>
<P>The Tendons of the First of these Two last De|scrib'd Muscles A, B, C, D, being Perforated E, to Transmit those of the Inferior Muscle F, H, and to their Insertions I, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is a no less Useful than Stupendious Artifice in Nature: For since its re|quisite the Fingers should be Bended with a con|siderable Strength, and each of their Internodes should be Accommodated to different Tactile Bo|dies, it was therefore Necessary the Muscles em|ploy'd in that Action, should not only be Large, Proportionable to the Force required; but that each Internode should be Furnish'd with a Parti|cular Instrument. The Internal Protuberance of the <HI>Os Humeri,</HI> being a Necessary place for the Rise of Part of these Muscles; but upon the Account of Bending the Cubit, the Extreams of that Part of them might suffer some Ap|proximation; it was therefore thought fit, that Place should be allotted to the Bender of the Se|cond Internodes of the Fingers, to which not so much Force is requir'd, as to the Bender of the Third Internodes; for the Fingers like so many Leaves are more effectually mov'd, when the <HI>Vis Movens</HI> is fastned to their Extreams, which is their Third Internodes; wherefore the Strongest Muscles are there Inserted: Now the Origin of the Superior Muscle being confin'd to the Inter|nal Extuberance of the <HI>Os Humeri,</HI> and Part of the <HI>Radius</HI> only, these Places could not Furnish Spaces for a Muscle so Large as that of near Two Thirds of the Superior and Forepart of the <HI>Ulna,</HI> Internal Edge of the <HI>Radius,</HI> and Intermediate Li|gament of the Bones of the Cubit, whence the Inferior Muscle Springs: Hence it Appears the Inferior Muscle is much Stronger than the Su|perior; wherefore the Tendons of the Latter are Perforated, to Transmit those of the Former in a right Progress to their Terminations, at the Ex|tremities of the Fingers: Nor is this Constructure only Advantageous in Bending the Fingers only; but if the External Muscle should be Divided Transversely, as I have sometimes seen it; yet the compleat Flexion of the Fingers has never|theless been perform'd by the Internal Muscle; which is a provident Contrivance in Nature.</P>

<P>_AS the Arm, Cubit, and Hand are compre|hended under the Title of the Whole Hand; so the Thigh, Leg and Foot, are in common call'd, the Foot. The Bones of those Parts are Represented, <HI>Tab.</HI> 103, 104, 105. where we shall speak of the particular Denominations of the Parts last mention'd: Our Business at present being to Explain the Muscles which move the Bones; First of the Muscles which move the Thigh-Bone. The Skin and Fat of the Buttocks being Rais'd, the Muscle which First offers its self to View, is the <HI>Glutaeus Major,</HI> here Rais'd and laid aside to shew its Inferior Surface (A.) The Superior or External Surface of this Muscle Appears Compos'd of divers Muscles, in whose <HI>Interstitia</HI> the Fat is Inserted, and requires an Artificial Ma|nagement of the Knife in freeing the Muscle of it, so as to leave no Part of the Fat behind, nor Wound the Fleshy Fi|bres of the Muscle.</P>
<P>A, B B, C, The <HI>Glutaeus Major</HI> Rais'd and Turn'd Down|ward. This Muscle is not well Describ'd by <HI>Anatomists,</HI> they only mentioning its Fleshy Part here Exprest; besides which, it has a Large Broad Tendinous Part, Springing from the Whole External Margin of the Spine of the <HI>Os Ilium</HI> (O O) next the <HI>Musculus Communis</HI> of the <HI>Membranosus,</HI> whence March|ing over the External Part of the <HI>Glutaeus Medius</HI> (D); at the Great <HI>Trochanter</HI> (E E), it meets with the Fleshy Part of this Muscle, Arising from the Posterior Part of the Spine of the <HI>Os Ilium,</HI> hindermost Part of the <HI>Sacrum</HI> Laterally, and <HI>Os Coccygis,</HI> and Cleaving to the Broad Ligament that's Extended between the Two last mention'd Bones and Tubercle of the <HI>Os Ischium</HI>; its Fleshy Fibres Descend Disgregately in an al|most Semicircular Manner, and become Tendinous as they approach the Great <HI>Trochanter</HI> where it's United with its First Describ'd Tendinous Beginning, which together De|scending over the Great <HI>Trochanter,</HI> joins with the Tendon of the <HI>Membranosus</HI> (of which hereafter,) and proceeds to Frame a Large, Thick, Strong Tendon (C,) Inserted to the <HI>Linea Asperia</HI> on the Back of the <HI>Os Femoris,</HI> near Four Fingers Breadth below the Great <HI>Rotator.</HI></P>
<P>The First Describ'd Tendinous Origin of this Muscle, do's not only serve to support its Fleshy Body, but its Fibres Ex|tending themselves, Intersect those of the <HI>Membranosus</HI> as they Cover all the Muscles of the <HI>Tibia,</HI> do more Adequate|ly Include those Muscles, and Corroborate them in their Actions; as we have elsewhere Observ'd of the Muscles of the Cubit and Fingers. When this Muscle Acts, it draws the Thigh directly Backwards.</P>
<P>I was lately Consulted in the Case of a Fistulous Ulcer a little above the Great <HI>Trochanter</HI>; the <HI>Sinus</HI> tended Upwards, and was at least Two Inches Deep from the Surface of the Skin, and about Three Inches in Length: I could Discover the Bottom of the <HI>Sinus</HI> to be very hard like a Cartilage; nor was it at all sensible to the Touch of the Probe, as the Patient Inform'd me; but on the contrary, told me, <HI>I than seem'd to Grate against the Bone.</HI> The <HI>Sinus</HI> had been divers times Open'd, and the hard Body at the Bottom of it laid bare, but the Wound could not be Cicatric'd: I Open'd it again, and afterwards cut out the hard Cartilaginous Body which Co|ver'd the External Part of the <HI>Glutaeus Medius</HI>; the Wound afterwards Incarn'd, and was Cur'd in a few Days. This Pre|ternatural hard Body was Fram'd in the First Describ'd Ten|dinous Part of the <HI>Glutaeus Major,</HI> and the Blood-Vessels would not Spring from it to afford Incarnation; nor would common Escharoticks Act on it, wherefore it continued to lie Bare; but after cutting it out thro' the Blood-Vessels from the Sub|jacent Muscle, the <HI>Glutaeus Medius</HI> Sprung up, and join'd with those of the Membranes under the Skin, by which means a Confirm'd <HI>Ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">atrice</HI> was made. By this we may be Inform'd how Useful Anatomy is in Surgery.</P>
<P>The like Case may happen on the Tendinous Expansion of the Inferior Part of the <HI>Membranosus,</HI> on the Muscles of the <HI>Tibia</HI> and <HI>Tarsus,</HI> where dividing it only according to its Length may be sufficient.</P>
<P>D, E E, F, <HI>Glutaeus Medius</HI>: This lies chiefly under the Tendinous Beginning of the <HI>Maximus,</HI> Arising Fleshy from almost the Whole External Part of the Spine of the <HI>Os Ilium,</HI> whence Descending becomes Thicker and Fleshy, and is In|serted (in a Semicircular Manner E E) by a Short Strong Ten|don, to the Superior and External Part of the Great <HI>Trochanter.</HI></P>
<P>This Muscle is not only Employ'd in Extending the Thigh, but is chiefly Serviceable in Turning it Inwards; and this Action of it will Manifest it self, if in Time of Dissection you give the Thigh that Motion as it lies on the Table; you may then Observe the Fore-part of this Muscle Notably Re|laxt; and in Living Persons when the Thigh is turn'd In|wards, you may see the Fore-part of this Muscle Tumified, which ought to be taken Notice of by Painters; or, if in Performing that Action with your own Thigh you lay your Thumb on this Muscle, you may easily Feel it move under the Skin: Besides these Actions, it's also Employ'd in Strad|ling or Pulling the Thighs and Legs from each other; it Co|operating with the <HI>Musculus Membranosus</HI> in that Action.</P>

<P>B, Part of its Tendi|nous Expansion Rais'd and Pinn'd out; it's call'd <HI>Membranosus</HI> and <HI>Fascia Lata,</HI> from its large Membranous Expansion, Com|prehending all the Muscles of the <HI>Tibia,</HI> together with Part of those of the Thigh: It hath an Acute Fleshy Beginning from the Fore-part of the Spine of the <HI>Os Ilium,</HI> between the Origination of the <HI>Sartorius,</HI> and First Describ'd Tendinous Beginning of the <HI>Glutaeus Magnus,</HI> being Dilated to a Fleshy Belly after an Oblique Descent, it becomes Tendi|nous Four Fingers Breadth below the Great <HI>Tro|chanter</HI>; whence it Descends Directly over the <HI>Va|stus Externus,</HI> to its Proper Termination at the Su|perior <HI>Appendix</HI> of the <HI>Fibula</HI>; but in its Progress thither, it is conjoyn'd with the Tendinous Ex|pansion of the <HI>Glutaeus Magnus,</HI> that Arises from the Spine of the <HI>Ilium,</HI> Covering the External Part of the <HI>Glutaeus Medius,</HI> and all the Exter|nal Muscles of the <HI>Tibia,</HI> as well as those of the Thigh-bone, and Descending over the <HI>Patella,</HI> Comprehends all the External Muscles of the <HI>Tarsus</HI> and Toes, and joins with the <HI>Ligamentum Annulare,</HI> which retains the Tendons of the Mu|scles of the Toes and Foot: Unless it may be sup|pos'd this <HI>Fascia Lata</HI> should End at the Lower|part of the Thigh-bone, or Superior Parts of the <HI>Tibia</HI> and <HI>Fibula,</HI> and that the last Nam'd Bones should give an Origin to the Inferior Part of the <HI>Fascia</HI>; which seems to be Matter more of Con|troversie than Use. When this Muscle Acts, it draws the Leg Outwards; its Tendon being join'd with Part of the Tendinous Beginning of the <HI>Glu|taeus Magnus,</HI> having a differing <HI>Series</HI> of Fi|bres Intersecting each other, do thereby Com|pose a Strong <HI>Involucrum,</HI> as well Including all the Common Muscles of the Leg, as Covering the Proper; whereby those Muscles are Corrobo|rated in their Actions.</P>

But the All-wise Architect of Humane Bodies has so Fram'd these Muscles, as not only to make them Useful in Supporting the Whole Body, and rendering them Effectually Serviceable in Walking, Running, and the like: But thro' the great Proportion of Strength of these Extending Muscles of the <HI>Ti|bia,</HI> they are also Capable (upon Inflection at the Knees) by their sudden Acting to Extend the Legs with such a Force, as to remove the Whole Body from the Place where it stood, as in leap|ing: In which Action, the Extending Muscles of the Back, namely the <HI>Sacrolumbales, Longissimi Dorsi,</HI> &amp;c. and the <HI>Gasterocnemii</HI> of the Feet do in like Manner Concur in Extending those Parts: A likeness of which is Represented in a piece of Whale-bone, <HI>Vid.

It must be Granted, that if the Tendon of this <HI>Semimembr anosus</HI> had past further on, and Terminated with those of the <HI>Seminervo|sus, Gracilis,</HI> and <HI>Sartorius,</HI> it would have rendred it capable of Performing its Action with Force; but in regard the Number of Tendons here on this Internal Side of the Ham are already Increas'd to Three, the Fourth could not well be ad|mitted without some Inconveniency, either in Performing its Office together with the Rest, or in the Figure of the Part: Besides it seems to be no small Artifice in Nature, as well here in the Leg, as in the Arm, to Furnish both with Proper Muscles, which should Gradually Bend them: Thus the Shorter Beginning of the <HI>Biceps Femoris</HI> and the Muscle now Treated of, are Analogous to the <HI>Brachialis In|ternus, Flexor Cubiti</HI>; and this Contrivance here seems the more convenient in re|spect of Walking; in which a moderate Flexion of one of the Legs is only Neces|sary, in Order to its Translation before the other.</P>

<P>When this Muscle Acts, the Foot is said to be Extended or pull'd Backwards, which Motion of it is very Necessary in Walking, Running, Leap|ing, and Standing on Tiptoe, &amp;c.

<P>C, The <HI>Musculus Popliteus,</HI> by some call'd <HI>Sub|popliteus</HI>: It Ariseth with a Short Strong Tendon from the External Head of the Inferior <HI>Appen|dix</HI> of the <HI>Os Femoris,</HI> whence Descending Ob|liquely over the Juncture, it becomes Fleshy or more and more Expanding it self, till it's Im|planted to the Superior Part of the <HI>Tibia</HI> Inter|nally, immediately below its Upper <HI>Appen|dix</HI> (a): This Muscle not only Assists the rest Imploy'd in Bending the <HI>Tibia,</HI> but it is Advan|tageously Situated to Antagonize the <HI>Biceps Fe|moris,</HI> when the Leg or Knee is Bended in Turn|ing the Foot and Toes Inwards.</P>

<P>The Office of this Muscle is very Obscure; its Tendinous Expansion on the Bottom of the Foot, is chiefly Serviceable in Defending the Subjacent Muscles, Tendons, Nerves, and Blood-Vessels, from being Comprest in Standing, Walking, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE EIGHTY-EIGHTH TABLE.</HEAD>
<P>_IS the Back and Side of a Humane <HI>Skel&eacute;ton.</HI></P>
<P>What has been said in the preceding Page relating to the Position of the Bones, with respect to their Bearing on each other, seems better Explain'd in the Figure of this Table: Whereby it Appears, if the Muscles which draw the Head Up, or Backwards, as well as those plac'd on the Back-part of the Whole Spine, were not very Large as well as Numerous, the Trunk of the Body as well as the Head, would be continually subject to fall Forwards. Nor could we Stand, much less Translate the Body from one Place to another, if the Extending Muscles of the Thigh-bones, those of the <HI>Tibiae</HI> and Feet, were not very Strong, as is elsewhere taken Notice of in the Description of those Muscles. Hence we may easily Conceive, why we can with less Difficulty continue a Progressive Motion for a longer Time, than in a Standing Posture; the Former being an Alternate Acting of most of the Muscles; the Latter a Continued or Tonic Action of some few Muscles only. Hence also we may be Inform'd, why the greatest Part of the Gravity of the Whole Body is sustain'd by one Leg only in Standing, rather than with both at once: And divers other <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of which my Time at present will not give leave so much as to make mention.</P>

<HEAD>THE EIGHTY-NINTH TABLE.</HEAD>
<P>_THIS and the Three following Tables Represent the Bones of the Skull, and those of the Upper and Under Jaws.</P>
<P>The Bones which Compose the Skull are the <HI>Ossa Frontis, Sincipitis, Occipilis, Temporum, Sphenoides</HI> and <HI>Cribriforme</HI>: Of these the Four First are esteem'd Proper to the Skull; the Two Latter are said to be Common to the Skull and Upper Jaw. The Bones of the Upper and Under Jaws will be more particularly Treated of in <HI>Tab.</HI> 92.</P>

<P>The Convex Fore-parts of the Forehead bone, with those of the Upper-Jaw and <HI>Os Sphenoides,</HI> as they Appear Separated from the rest of the Bones of the Skull.</P>
<P>A, The Forehead-bone whose Superior Margin, Sutur'd with the the <HI>Ossa Sincipitis,</HI> Composes near Two Thirds of a Circle.</P>
<P>B B B, Parts of the Superior <HI>Lamellae</HI> or Table which sticks out with Sharp Edges and Points, which are receiv'd in the <HI>Interstitia</HI> of the like Fram'd by the <HI>Ossa Sincipitis,</HI> which Conjunction is call'd <HI>Sutura.</HI></P>
<P>C C, The Lower-part of the Frontal-bone, Composing the Superior Part of the Orbit of the Eye.</P>
<P>D, A Process of the <HI>Os Frontis</HI> near the Great <HI>Cantbus</HI> of the Eye.</P>
<P>E, Another Process of the same Bone towards the Lesser <HI>Can|thus.</HI></P>
<P>F, Part of the <HI>Os Cuneiforme</HI> join'd to the Frontal-bone, by <HI>Bidloo</HI> call'd Two Eminencies of the last nam'd Bone, on both Sides towards the Temples.</P>
<P>G, In this as well as the rest of the Bones of the Skull, may be seen divers <HI>Foraminulae</HI> for the coming in and going out of Blood-Vessels, whether belonging to the <HI>Dura Mater</HI> and Common Integuments of the Skull, or <HI>Duploi</HI> of the Skull it self.</P>
<P>H, That Part of the <HI>Os Frontis,</HI> where a Cavity is Fram'd contain|ing a Pituitous Membrane, which is continuous with that of the <HI>Fora|mina Narium,</HI> and Helps to Separate Part of the <HI>Mucus</HI> that is Ex|creted at the Nose. This Cavity is often Divided with a <HI>Septum Osseum</HI>; as Appears in <HI>Tab.</HI> 91. <HI>Fig.</HI> 2. In some Humane Skulls this Cavity scarce Appears, in others it is very Large, especially in those who have Projecting Eye-brows. Those that take much Snuff may have Part of it, get up into this Cavity, and there Lodge, and prove Pernicious. In Quadrupedes these Cavities are Large and Di|vided by divers Bony Partitions, and Communicate with each other by Various Apertures: In Sheep I have frequently found in those Cavities divers Large Maggots, not unlike the Great <HI>Eruca Terrestris.</HI> In Cows, Bulls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> these Cavities are very Large; in these Animals the Pituitary Membrane which Invests these Cavities, frequently be|comes Inflam'd and Thickned; whereby the <HI>Pituita</HI> is Pent up in these Cavities, and causes a Disease in those Animals, call'd <HI>the Stag|gers</HI>; for which the Country People (particularly in <HI>Sussex</HI>) perform this following Operation, and the Animal is presently reliev'd.</P>
<P>The Head of the Beast being held in a convenient Posture, and the Operator Furnish'd with a Mallet and Large Broad Chisel: With One or Two Stroaks he drives his Chisel into the <HI>Os Frontis,</HI> which Com|poses this Cavity; this done, he raises up the Bone with its Superja|cent Parts, by means of the Chisel; then with his Fingers he Sepa|rates the Pituitary Membrane from the Bone, and draws it out: This done, he presently Depresses the Rais'd up Parts with his Hand; and the Divided Bone afterwards Unites, and the Animal is seldom Trou|bled with the like Disease afterwards.</P>
<P>This Membrane fill'd with <HI>Pituita</HI> (they tell you) is a Water-bag lying on the Brain.</P>

<P>These are Distinguish'd into Three Parts; <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Carpus</HI> or <HI>Brachialis,</HI> (1, 2, 3, 4, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) the <HI>Metacarpus</HI> or <HI>Postbrachialis</HI> (E E E); and the Fingers (F G H I); First of the Bones of the <HI>Car|pus</HI> or Wrist: These are Eight in Number, and Compos'd of Two Orders or Ranks of Bones; of which the First Rank is commonly reckon'd to have Four 1, 2, 3, 4; the Two First of these Bones jointly Compose a Smooth Convext Surface, Cover'd with a Cartilage which is re|ceiv'd in a Shallow <HI>Sinus</HI> at the Inferior Part of the <HI>Radius,</HI> Tab. 96. Fig. 5, 6. C D; which Articula|tion is call'd <HI>Arthrodia</HI>: The Third Bone here Exprest, do's not Help to Compose the Articula|tion of either Rank, but is Fasten'd on the Fourth by a Ligament, which Conjunction is call'd <HI>Syndesmosis</HI>; the Use of this Third Bone, is to Help to Support the Transverse Ligament, under which the Tendons Bending the Fingers pass: The Fourth Bone (plac'd between the Second and Eighth) do's not Compose either Rank, whe|ther Articulated with the <HI>Radius</HI> or Metacarpal Bones, but is Inserted between the Two Ranks: The Fifth Bone here Exprest, is not properly to be reckon'd among those of the Two Ranks, but like the Fourth is plac'd between them, and is Ar|ticulated to the First Bone of the Thumb; which Articulation may be call'd <HI>Synarthrosis</HI>: The Sixth Bone here Exprest, ought to be reckon'd the Seventh, the Sixth not being Exprest in this Figure, but is Represented in <HI>Fig.</HI> 2. *: This may be properly reckon'd the First of the Second Rank, to whose Lower Part the Metacarpal|bone of the Fore-Finger is Articulated: The Se|venth Bone of the <HI>Carpus</HI> (here Sign'd the Sixth as above Noted) like the preceding, is Articu|lated with the Metacarpal-bone of the Middle-Finger, and may be properly Esteem'd the Se|cond Bone of the Second Rank or Order: The Eighth Bone of the <HI>Carpus</HI> (here Sign'd Seventh and Eighth) is the Third and Last Bone of the Second Rank: The Lower-parts of the Metacar|pal-bones of the Little and Ring-Fingers, are Conjoin'd to this Eigth Bone of the <HI>Carpus</HI> by <HI>Synarthrosis</HI>: The Upper-parts of the Three Bones of the Second Rank last Treated of, (not unlike the Two First of the First Rank) do Con|junctly Frame a Convext Oblong Smooth Surface on their Upper-parts, which is receiv'd in a Con|cave fitted for it, fram'd by the Inferior Parts of the Two First Bones of the First Rank: This Articulation made by the Two Ranks of Bones of the <HI>Carpus,</HI> may also be call'd <HI>Arthrodia.</HI></P>

<P>The Back-part of the Skeleton of a <HI>Foetus</HI> of about Four Months after Conception.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Embryo,</HI> or First Rudiments of the <HI>Foe|tus</HI> within the Womb; those Parts which after|wards become Bones, are than Intirely Cartilagi|nous, till about the End of the First Month after Impregnation; at which Time divers Bony Specks or Ossifications begin to Appear about the Middle of the Larger Bones of the Limbs, especially in the <HI>Claviculae.</HI> Two Months after Conception, the Whole Head do's not afford any Bony Appear|ance, except the Third Pair of Bones of the Upper Jaw, and the Two Bones which Frame the Lower Jaw, which about this Time Appear Distinct. The Middle-parts of the <HI>Claviculae</HI> are Bony after the First Six Weeks. The Shoulder-blades are with|out any Proper Figure about the Second Month after Conception, at which Time their Ossifica|tions begin in their Middle-parts: About the Third Month their Spinal Process's begin to be Bony, as well as their Coracoidal and Short Pro|cess's: Near this Time the Whole Spine, or <HI>Ver|tebrae</HI> of the Neck, Back, Loins, <HI>Os Sacrum</HI> and <HI>Coccygis,</HI> begin to be Bony. The Sixth <HI>Vertebra</HI> of the Back Internally, some Bony Specks in each <HI>Vertebra</HI> Appear, and Gradually Lessen them|selves to the Fifth <HI>Vertebra</HI> of the Neck; the like Ossifications may be Observ'd to become Less and Less in each <HI>Vertebra,</HI> towards the Lower-part of the Spine, to the Third <HI>Vertebra</HI> of the <HI>Os Sa|crum.</HI> The Incurvation or Bending Forwards of the Whole Spine at this Time, is Remarkable. The Four Upper <HI>Vertebrae</HI> of the Neck, afford some Bony Appearances Laterally, about the Third Month; near which Time the Bodies of the Three Upper <HI>Vertebrae</HI> of the <HI>Os Sacrum,</HI> seem to Frame One Bone, but its Lateral Parts are not Bony till the Fourth Month; at which Time the Bodies of the Third and Fourth <HI>Vertebrae</HI> of the Neck begin to Appear. The Fifth and Sixth Month, the <HI>Epistropheus</HI> or Second <HI>Vertebra</HI> of the Neck has a Bony Speck; but its Tooth-like Process is yet Cartilaginous: The Fore-part of the <HI>Atlas</HI> or First <HI>Vertebra</HI> is yet wanting. The <HI>Os Coccygis</HI> is Cartilaginous till about the Eighth or Ninth Month; at which Time, in its Internal Part, call'd its Body, Two Offeous Specks Appear about the Bigness of Two great Pin's Heads. All the <HI>Vertebrae</HI> of the Spine of the <HI>Foetus</HI> (at this Time) Appear Compos'd of Three Bones; First that of the Bodies of the <HI>Vertebrae</HI> Forwards; Secondly its Two Lateral Parts which Frame their Transverse Process's: Their Spinal Process's not Appearing Bony till some Time after the <HI>Par|tus</HI>; whence (as <HI>Spigelius</HI> Observes) Rope-Dan|cers, Tumblers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by early Practice whilst they are Children, the Spines of the Back-bone give way to the Inflection of their <HI>Vertebrae</HI> Back|wards; the common Position of the Spines being Obliquely Descending, they do thereby incline more Horizontal, and their Points are also ren|dred more Obtuse.</P>
<P>The <HI>Os Innominatum</HI> about the Second Month after Conception is Cartilaginous, except that Part of it call'd <HI>Ilium,</HI> where it Frames the Upper-part of the <HI>Acetabulum,</HI> it has a Bony Speck about the Bigness of a Common Pin's Head. In the Fourth Month the <HI>Os Coxendicis</HI> or <HI>Ischium,</HI> (another Part of the <HI>Os Innominatum</HI>) has a Bony Appear|ance, where it meets the <HI>Ilium</HI> within the <HI>Aceta|bulum,</HI> not exceeding the Head of a common Pin in Magnitude; the like may be Observ'd of the <HI>Os Pubis</HI> within the <HI>Acetabulum</HI>: These Three Bones which Compose the <HI>Innominatum,</HI> remain Distinguish'd in the <HI>Foetus</HI> by a Cartilaginous In|terposition, which continues till the Seventh Year, at which Age those Cartilaginous Marks Disappear. In the Second Month all the Ribs except the First and Last, are so harden'd, that the Channels (Exprest <HI>Fig.</HI> 4. <HI>Tab.</HI> 94. E,) or <HI>Si|nus</HI>'s for the Intercostal Blood-Vessels and Nerves, Appear.</P>
<P>The Time of the Ossification of the <HI>Sternum</HI> is uncertain; but <HI>Eustachius</HI> is mistaken in saying, It's altogether Cartilaginous in Children Newly Born. <HI>Kerckringius</HI> affirms he never Diffected a <HI>Foetus</HI> of Four Months, but he found some Little Bony-Bodies in the <HI>Sternum.</HI> Their Number and Figure Varying in most Subjects, we need not say more of them in this place. The Ossification of the <HI>Artus</HI> is very Early, as Appears by the First and Second Figures of this Table, where the Mid|dle-parts of the Bones First Appear in little White Specks a Month after Conception, as above No|ted; but some of their Appendages are Intirely Cartilaginous for some Months after the Birth. The Eight Cartilages of the <HI>Carpus</HI> become Bony some Time after the Birth. The Appendages of the Bones of the <HI>Metacarpus</HI> and Fingers, conti|nue Intirely Cartilaginous some Months after the Birth; the like may be Observ'd of the Feet and Toes; the <HI>Patellae</HI> in like Manner are Intirely Cartilaginous some Months after the Birth.</P>

<P>One of the Nails.</P>
<P>A, The Upper-part of the Nail, commonly call'd its Root.</P>

<P>The Nails Arise from their Subjacent Parts, call'd their Roots, Fram'd of a Complication of Nerves and Blood-Vessels; whence Horny Fibres or Tubes Arise, and being United, Compose that Hard Bo|dy call'd the Nail. The Horny Fibres which make the Outside or Convex Surface of the Nail, Arise from the Lower-part of its Root next the Second Internode of the Finger; the rest of the Horny Fi|bres which Arise from the Superior Part of its Root towards the Top of the Finger; successively make the Internal Concave Surface of the Nail: So that the Extremity of the Nail which Extends it self be|yond the Top of the Finger, is Fram'd of all the Fibres which Arise from the Surface of its Root, and is much Thicker than its other Extream towards its Root: Hence it happens that the External Surface towards the Root of the Nail is Protruded Forwards towards its Top; as may be Observ'd if you Mark the Lower-part of the Nail towards its Root, you will see it advance to the Top; which at Length is either Worn away or cut off. When any Corosive Matter (as in a <HI>Paronychia</HI> or the like) destroys the Tender Roots of the Horny Fibres, the Nail necessarily falls off; but nevertheless it will Bud again, and a New Nail will Grow in its place; which commonly do's not prove so Beauti|ful as the Former, whether occasion'd by too early Using it, or its being Expos'd to the External Air, or some inconvenient Covering made Use of, to Defend it from Outward Injuries.</P>

If any Parts of the Legs or Thighs are Diseas'd, as in an <HI>Anasarca,</HI> with an <HI>Erysipelas,</HI> Abcess, Exulceration, especially with a <HI>Caries</HI> of the Bone, and the like; you will most commonly find the Inguinal Glandules Tumid and Hard: The like may be Observ'd of the Axillary Glands, when the <HI>Mammae,</HI> Arms, Cubits, or Hands are in like Manner Affected. The Intumescence of these Lymphatick Glands, in the Cases above mention'd, is caus'd by the Vitiated <HI>Lympha,</HI> Arising from the Diseas'd Parts, not pasting the <HI>Vesiculae Glandulosae</HI>; whence a Tumor is begun, and is still Increas'd by the Accession of the succeding <HI>Lympha,</HI> and the Whole Gland becomes Distended to a vast Magnitude; as Appear'd in the Case of the Late Sir <HI>William Cranmer,</HI> in whom, after Death, I found the Glandule of the Right Inguine to Weigh above Six Pounds, and the Trunk of the Crural Artery passing thro' the Lower-part of it. Tho' the Surface of this Tumified Gland seem'd to have Matter Fluctuating in divers Parts of it, yet no other than a Glandulous Appearance Offer'd on Dividing it Variously. The like Intumescence of the Inguinal Glands happen'd after Castration, in a <HI>Hernia Carnosa</HI> of the same Side, which in like Manner prov'd Fatal. In the Case of an <HI>Anasarca</HI> of one Leg, on which an <HI>Erysipelas</HI> happen'd, I found the Inguinal Gland on the same Side very much Indurated and somewhat Distended. When the Excoriation from the <HI>Erysipelas</HI> began to Abate of the Flux of Matter, the Inguinal Gland above became more and more Distended; at length the Outward Skin on it began to look Red, and soon after Imposthumated: After the contain'd <HI>Pus</HI> was Discharg'd, I could pass my Probe very Deep into divers Interstices of the Gland, in which the Matter was Lodg'd; all which <HI>Sinus's</HI> after some Weeks Clos'd by the Use of Desiccative Topicks, with convenient Bandage, without Hard Tents or Dozils. In this Case the Patient took divers Doses of <HI>Cala|mel,</HI> and Strong Purges. The like Intumescence of these Glands also happens in Venerial Cases, especially when the External Parts of the <HI>Penis</HI> are Ulcerated, as I have elsewhere taken Notice of.</P>

<P>f, The Parotide Salival Gland.</P>
<P>Under this Parotide Salival Gland, are plac'd divers Lym|phatick Glands, which receive <HI>Lympha</HI> from their Importing Lymphe-ducts, Arising from the Neighbouring Parts as well as the Parotide Salival Gland it self. Besides these Lympha|tick Glands immediately under the Parotides, there are still others of the same kind below them, lying near the Jugular Veins, and are continued to the <HI>Claviculae</HI>; all these Transmit <HI>Lympha</HI> (by their Exporting Lymphe-ducts) either to the Subclavian Glands, or to the Upper-part of the Thoracick-duct immediately. These Lymphatick Glands become Tu|mid in Scrophulous Cases, and may be happily remov'd by Incision, and no great Flux of Blood follow; which Practice is Preferable to the Application of Escharoticks which are commonly made use of. I have at this Time a Patient in whom not only the above mention'd Superior Lymphatick Glands of the Left Side were Distended, but the Parotide Sa|lival Gland of the same Side was very much Indurated, and not a lit
tle Distended also; in the Middle of which Indura|tion of the Parotide Gland, I found an Aperture whence the Spittle Flow'd in no small Quantity, in Mastication: In Pressing the Part near the Aperture, I found the Spittle Gush out, which had Lodg'd it self between the Skin and the Gland. After the External Skin was Divided, I could plainly see the Spittle Arise from divers Interstices of the <HI>Lobuli</HI> of the Gland; when he Chaw'd any Thing, the Spittle Flow'd on his Handkerchief (<HI>per Stillicidium,</HI>) which he was wont to hold under his Ear to receive it. The <HI>Sinus's</HI> from whence the Spittle was Discharg'd being thus laid Open, the Quantity of Spittle which Flow'd, soon Abated; the Fungous Flesh being remov'd by the Application of Gentle Escharoticks, the Flux of <HI>Saliva</HI> Lessen'd. He Drinking of a Decoction of <HI>Sarsapa|rila, China, Lig. Guiaci,</HI> &amp;c. for his common Drink, and Eating of a very Drying Diet, such as Biskets, Almonds, and the like.</P>
<P><HI>Aquapendens</HI> in Treating of the Wounds of the Cheeks, mentions a clear Water not unlike the Tears of the Eyes, which he saw Flow from a very small Hole when the Patient Eat; to which he adds, <HI>Vnde &amp; quomodo effluat, Ego certe nescio.</HI></P>
<P>The Accurate <HI>Nuck</HI> tells us (from <HI>Roonhuyse</HI> a Dutch Wri|ter) of a Patient in whom the Spittle Flow'd from an Ulcer in the Cheek, not unlike that above mention'd: Nor was the Flux of Spittle Abated, and the Ulcer brought to a <HI>Cicatrix</HI> without a Drying Diet, as the Incomparable <HI>Nuck</HI> takes No|tice. A Flux of <HI>Lympha</HI> sometimes happens in Wounds of the Limbs, where the Lymphe-ducts are Wounded. After Letting Blood in the Flexure of the Cubit, I saw (the next Day) a vast Quantity of Lympha had Stain'd the Shirt which lay over the Orifice, and about the Arm; the next Day af|ter, the Flux of Lympha Abated, and the Orifice soon after Clos'd. Perhaps a great Part of that Thin Matter call'd <HI>Gleet,</HI> which we find some Days after Amputations, or large Wounds, Flows from the Divided Lymphe-ducts as well as Nutritive Tubes of the Part. When Lymphe-ducts are broken in Old Ulcers, and the Flux of <HI>Lympha</HI> do's not ea|sily Abate, tho' the Patient is confin'd to a Drying Diet. The like Difficulty attended the restraining of the Flux of <HI>Lym|pha</HI> when a Lymphe-duct was Open'd in an Issue in the Leg, as was Communicated to me by <HI>Mr. Bernard</HI> and <HI>Mr. Guddier</HI> both Experienc'd Surgeons of this Town; in which Case a Drying Diet stopt the Flux, and the Ulcer was soon after Ci|catric'd; tho' many Desicatives Topicks, as well as Actual and Potential Cauteries, had before prov'd Ineffectual. By this we may see (however some endeavour to Disparage Anatomy) how Useful it is in the Practice of Surgery.</P>

<P>_SHEWS the Trunks and large Ramifications of all the Arte|ries of a Humane <HI>Foetus,</HI> Injected with Wax, and Display'd after Dissection.</P>
<P>1, The <HI>Aorta,</HI> or <HI>Arteria Magna,</HI> cut from its Origin at the Orifice of the Left Ventricle of the Heart.</P>
<P>2, The Trunk of the Great Coronal Artery of the Heart Ari|sing from the Beginning of the <HI>Aorta</HI>; the Rise of the Lesser Coronal Artery, not Appearing in this Position of the <HI>Arteria Magna.</HI></P>
<P>3, The <HI>Canalis Arteriosus</HI> Fill'd with Wax, by Injecting it into the <HI>Aorta</HI>: This Arises from the Upper Part of the Trunk of the Pulmonick Artery (near its Two Ramifications which pass into the Lungs) and after an Oblique Descent under the Beginning of the <HI>Aorta,</HI> Empties it self into the Upper Part of its Descending Trunk, as here Exprest 28. Besides this Communication between the Right Ventricle of the Heart of a <HI>Foetus,</HI> and <HI>Arteria Magna</HI>; there is another call'd <HI>Foramen Ovale,</HI> by which Part the Blood, at its Entrance into the Right Ven|tricle, passes into the Pulmonick Vein, and the Left Ventricle of the Heart, thence to the <HI>Aorta.</HI> Hence it Appears, That the Blood which Flows into the Right Ventricle of the Heart of the <HI>Foetus,</HI> Passes immediately (by the <HI>Canalis Arteriosus</HI>) to the <HI>Arteria Magna,</HI> as well as the Blood of the Left Ventricle (which is Receiv'd immediately from the <HI>Vena C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a,</HI> or Right Article of the Heart) into the Pulmonick Vein, and Left Ventricle: So that the Blood in the <HI>Foetus,</HI> which Runs into the Right Ventricle, passes immediately to the <HI>Aorta,</HI> by the <HI>Systole</HI> of the Heart, as well as the Blood of the Left Ventricle: Not do's any Part of the Blood of the Right Ventricle pass into the Left; Or any Blood of the Left Ventricle first pass the Right, as in the Adult. Hence the Heart in the <HI>Foetus</HI> may be said to have but One Ventricle in Effect, since the Blood which passes One, do's not come into the Other, before it arrives at the <HI>Aorta.</HI> After the Birth, when the Infant has Receiv'd Air into the Lungs (and their <HI>Vesciculae</HI> remain Distended, and the Rami|fications of the Pulmonick Arteries and Vein consequently are more Display'd) the Blood th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> begins to pass their Extremities, more freely than before; and the Arterious Chanel at length becomes neglected, as well as the <HI>Foramen Ovale</HI>; the Former becoming a Li|g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">, and the Latter

So soon as the Subclavian Artery has past the <HI>Claevicula,</HI> it marches thro' the <HI>Axilla,</HI> wherefore it's call'd <HI>Axillaris,</HI> whence it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. Trunk Descends between the <HI>Masculus Brachiaeus Intermu</HI> and <HI>Externus,</HI> on the Inside of the Arm, and is Divided below the Bending of the Cubit, as you see it Exprest in the Figure; it Parting with Several Branches to the Neighbouring Muscles, and Parts it Passes by; Their Distribution not being alike in any Two Subjects, I have hitherto Examin'd, or in the Right and Left Sides of the same, as appears in this Figure: Tho' the Progress of their Large Trunks are commonly Uniform; yet in that too, they vary considerably, and the Trunk of the Artery at the Flexure of the Cubit sometimes runs Collateral with the <HI>Vena Basilica,</HI> tho' it most commonly passes Under that Vein: Of this, Those that Let Blood ought to take Notice, and that the Vessel they See or Feel has no Pulsation, before they thrust their Launset into it. Nor can I omit a Useful Observation in this Place; which is, That the Operator before He applies his Ligature on the Arm, should first feel for the Artery, because afterwards its Palsation cannot be so easily Discover'd; the Reason of which is Obvious. After Amputation, above the Elbow, the Trunk of the Axillary Artery only, affords any Considerable Flux of Blood: In Amputations below the Elbow, we find Two, some|times Three, and Four Considerable Trunks, which may require <HI>Tying Up</HI>; the Manner of which Practice is so well Describ'd in the Works of <HI>Ambrose Pary,</HI> I shall omit saying any Thing of it in this Place, tho' it has been most commonly Disus'd in this King|dom till of Late; the many Conveniencies of which Practice will (I don't doubt) suffi|ciently Recommend it to a General Use, as well in other Impetuous Fluxes of Blood, as in those after Amputations. After the External Iliack Artery (54) is past out of the Ca|vity of the <HI>Abdomen,</HI> it obtains the Name of the Crural Artery, (69.) and Descends ob|liquely on the Crural Vein, on the Fore-part of the Thigh, immediately Under the <HI>Mus|culus Sartorius</HI>: About Four Fingers Breadth above the Knee, these Two Large Blood Vessels pass thro' the Lower Part of the <HI>Musculus Triceps</HI> to the Ham, (71.) here the Vein is Plac'd Above the Artery as in other Parts, and so Descends to the Foot, after being Divided in Three Branches, as is Exprest in <HI>Fig.</HI> 72.</P>

<P>F, The Great <HI>Foramen,</HI> through which the <HI>Medulla Spinalis</HI> Descends from the Head.</P>
<P>G, A Small Muscle, which from its Position I call <HI>Rectus Lateralis</HI>: I first met with it in Dissection, some time since, and afterwards found it was partly Mention'd by <HI>Galen,</HI> and De|scrib'd by <HI>Fallo~ppius</HI>: It Arises from the Superior Part of the Extremity of the Transverse Pro|cess of the First <HI>Vertebra</HI> of the Neck, and Ascends directly to its Implantation in the <HI>Os Occipitis</HI>; when it Acts, it Nods the Head Laterally.</P>

Tho' this Passage thro' the <HI>Tympanum</HI> is not commonly so Open as in the First Case, yet naturally there is a Small Passage by the Upper Part of the <HI>Membrana Tympani</HI> into the <HI>Measus Auditorius,</HI> which seems necessary, to the End when the <HI>Tympamon</HI> is Fill'd with Air, any Sudden <HI>Impetus</HI> of the Ex|ternal Air should not Violate the <HI>Membrana Tympani.</HI> The <HI>Meatus &agrave; Palato ad Aurem</HI> do's not only Convey Air into the <HI>Tympamon,</HI> but (constantly remaining Open) it Admits of a Flu|ctuation of the Contain'd Air of the <HI>Tympamon,</HI> as well as a Fresh Supply: If this Passage is Straiten'd, a Difficulty of Hearing necessarily Follows; if it is totally Obstructed, a Deafness; in which Case, the Taking of Sneezing Powders gives Relief.</P>

<P>C C, Parts of the Two Iliack Veins, which may be seen Distended with Wind below the Right Iliack Artery, as the <HI>Vena Cava</HI> is above; The External Iliack Veins, as well as the Cru|tal Veins, lie immediatly under the Trunks of the Arteries that Accompany them, till they Pass by the Lower Part of the <HI>Musculus Triceps</HI> and <HI>Os Femoris,</HI> to the Ham, where the Vein is Upper|most and the Artery Passes Underneath, after the same Manner the Great Trunks of Veins and Arteries do in other Parts. This Contrivance in Nature of Placing the Trunks of the Iliack and Upper Parts of the Crural Arteries on the Veins, is an Admirable Artifice to Accelerate the Ascention of the Blood to the <HI>Vena Cava</HI> and Heart, as it Arises from the Inferior Parts, by means of the Pulsation of the Arteries. If you Inject the Arteries with Wax and afterwards Fill the Veins with the same, you will see by the Figure of the Wax Contain'd in the Veins, what Ef|fect the Pulsations of the Arteries have on them, in Order to Promote the Ascention of the Re|fluent Blood from below. In this Compressure made by the Iliack Artery of the Right Side, on the Inferior Part of the <HI>Vena Cava</HI> its Contain'd Blood is Forc'd to Ascend towards the Heart, the Valves in the Crural Veins Opposing its Descent: By this means also the <HI>Pondus</HI> of the Re|fluent Blood from below is Lessen'd, to the End its Motion may be the better Carri'd on at the Extremities of the Vessels in the Legs and Feet, and a Kind of a Pulsation made by the <HI>Vena Ca|va,</HI> whereby the Lymphatick Lumbal Gland R R, lying between it and the Bodies of the <HI>Ver|tebrae</HI> is gently Comprest, of which hereafter.</P>

<P>Here we can't but take Notice of a Considerable Artifice in Nature in the Disposition of these Lymphatick Lumbal Glands, whereby the Progress of the <HI>Lympha</HI> is Promoted towards the <HI>Re|ceptaculum Chyli.</HI> As the Lympheducts Pass from the Inferior Parts, they Accompany the Trunks of the Arteries, by whose Continual Motion of <HI>Systole</HI> and <HI>Diastole,</HI> the Ascent of the <HI>Lympha</HI> is Promoted as well as the Blood; but when the <HI>Lympha</HI> Arrives at the Lumbal Glands, the Pul|sation of the Ascending Trunk of the Great Artery being not sufficient (by reason those Glands are much Larger than the Exterior Surface of that Artery can give a Sutable Impulse to;) One of the Lumbal Glands R R, is Plac'd under the <HI>Vena Cava</HI> B, or between it and the <HI>Ver|tebrae Lumbares,</HI> by which its <HI>Vesiculae</HI> are gently Comprest, and their Contain'd <HI>Lympha</HI> is Push'd on towards the <HI>Receptaculum Chyli.</HI></P>

<P>The Use of the <HI>Epiglottis</HI> is to Cover the <HI>Glottis</HI> in Deglutition, so that the Aliment may Descend over it into the <HI>Gula</HI> and Sto|mach.

In ta|king out the Brain you'll find them under the Fore-part of the Second Process of the <HI>Dura Mater</HI> near the <HI>Sella Turcica</HI>: They March into the Duplicature of the <HI>Dura Mater</HI> immediately un|der the Former, and pass the Second <HI>Foramen</HI> of the <HI> Os Sphenoi|des</HI> with them into the <HI>Orbita Oculi</HI>: They are call'd <HI>Par Patheti|ciam,</HI> either because some Branches of them pass to the Oblique Mindes of the Eye, or that considerable Branches (if not their Whole Trunks) pass the <HI>Trochleae</HI> Cartilages of the Eyes.</P>
<P>5, 5, The Fifth Pair are very Large in their Originals, at the Upper and Lateral Part of the <HI>Processus Annularis,</HI> near the <HI>Pe|dunculus</HI> or Second Process of the <HI>Cerebellum.</HI> In taking out the Brain from the <HI>Basis</HI> of the Skull, you'll find these Nerves im|mediately under the Pathetick: Nor can you well see them to cut them off (in this Operation) unless you First Divide the Second Process of the <HI>Dura Mater,</HI> where it's Fasten'd to the Extremity of the Inner Process of the <HI>Os Petrosum</HI>: After they pass over the Extremity of the last mention'd Process they Frame Gangleons, and each is Divided into Three Branches Repre|presented in the preceding Figure.</P>
<P>6, 6. The Sixth Pair of Nerves are about the Bigness of the Third, and Arise from the Hinder-part of the Annular Process, not far from the <HI>Basis</HI> of the <HI>Corpora Pyramidalia</HI>; as they pass on the Annular Protuberance, some Branches of the Cervical Artery run over them: They Enter the Duplicature of the <HI>Dura Mater</HI> below the Former. <HI>Vid.

<P>7, 7, The Seventh Pair are the the Auditory or Hearing Nerves, each of which are Compos'd of Two Nerves; the One being Hard, the other Soft, which have Distinct Originals: The For|mer or Hard Trunk Springing from the <HI>Medulla Oblongata</HI>; the Latter or Softer Arising very Remote from it, being continu'd from divers Bright Medullary Fibres that Appear in the Fourth Ventricle of the Brain, whence they Creep on the Sides of the <HI>Caudex Medullaris,</HI> till they meet with the Harder Trunk, which they Accompany to the <HI>Ossa Petrosa,</HI> Fig. 26. 7, 7. The Soft Nerves being Expanded within the Labyrinths and Cochleas of the Organs of Hearing; whilst the Hard Trunks pass thro' the Bone, and Expand themselves in a Larger Field, as the Accu|rate <HI>Vieussens</HI> Represents them.</P>
<P>8, 8, The Eighth Pair of Nerves or <HI>Par Vagum</HI>; each of those have Ten or Twelve Nervous <HI>Fibrillae</HI> Springing from the <HI>Me|dulla Oblongata,</HI> immediately below the Annular Process m, m, and under the <HI>Corpora Olivaria</HI> o o, or between them and the Third or Cordal Processes of the <HI>Cerebellum, Tab.</HI> 10. <HI>Fig.</HI> 1.

<P>9, 9, The Ninth Pair of Nerves, whose Various Originals of the Right Side differ from those of the Left: They continue to derive their Beginnings at Various Distances from the Upper-parts of the <HI>Corpora Olivarea,</HI> to Half an Inch in Length on the <HI>Caudex Medullaria</HI>; some of the Fibres of that on the Left Side, passing over the Vertebral Artery of the same Side, when those of the contrary Side pass from under it: After passing a short Space, these Nervous Fibres Collectively pass the Third Perfo|ration of the <HI>Os Occipitis.

<P>* * The Spinal Accessory Nerves as they Ascend from under the Vertebral Arteries to the <HI>Par Vagum</HI>: They Arise much Lower from the <HI>Medulla Spinalis</HI> than <HI>Vieussens</HI> describes them, even from the Formost and Hindmost Beginnings of the Seventh Pair of Nerves of the Neck (16) and in their Collateral Ascent to the Spinal Marrow, they still receive New Roots from all the Ner|vous Origins they pass by, except those of the Ninth Pair of the Brain.</P>

<P>The Back-parts of the Muscles of the <HI>Pharynx</HI> and <HI>Oesopha|gus.</HI></P>
<P>A A A, That Part which Composes the <HI>Pharynx.</HI></P>
<P>B B, The <HI>Musculus Pterygopharyngeus</HI>: This is Erroneously Divi|ded into Two Pair of Muscles by Authors, as Appears by <HI>Tab.</HI> 34. <HI>Fig.</HI> 3, 4. after <HI>Bourdon</HI>: It has Two Thin Fleshy Origins from the Roots of the <HI>Processus Pterygoides,</HI> and in a Semicircular Manner Em|braces the Back-part of the Glandulous Membrane of the <HI>Fauces</HI> as well as the <HI>Tonsillae.</HI> When it Acts in Deglutition, it not only Strai|tens the <HI>Fauces,</HI> but Compresses the <HI>Tonsillae,</HI> as well as the Lesser Glands of the <HI>Fauces,</HI> and Forces out their contain'd Matter at the same Time, to join with the Aliment in its Descent to the Stomach; this Muscle Acts in like Manner in Secretion or Hawking up any Te|nacious Matter, whither Log'd in the <HI>Fauces</HI> or Excretory Ducts of the <HI>Tonsillae.</HI> I chuse to make this a Distinct Muscle from the <HI>Oeso|phageus,</HI> not only because its Extended on that Part call'd the <HI>Pharynx,</HI> but it Acts Distinct from the <HI>Oesophageus</HI>; for when this is Contracted in Deglutition, that is Dilated.</P>

<P>F, Part of the Superior Long Process of the Scutiformal Carti|lage, whence the last mention'd Muscle partly Arises.</P>
<P>G, The <HI>Musculus Vaginalis Gulae,</HI> Cover'd with its External Mem|brane. The Fibres of this Perforated Muscle of the <HI>Gula,</HI> have a Double Order of Fibres; the External Descend according to their Length, the Internal Parts Obliquely; the Former seem to Arise from the Arytenoi|dal Cartilages under the <HI>Glottis,</HI> and passing somewhat Obliquely to the Back-part of the <HI>Gula,</HI> Descend to the Stomach; the Latter Or|der of Fibres seem to be a Continuation of the <HI>Constrictor Gulae,</HI> and Descend Obliquely to the Upper Orifice of the Stomach. The Office of this Muscle is to Press the Aliment after Deglutition into the Sto|mach, to which, by its own Weight it is apt to Descend in Humane Bodies; but in Quadrupedes the Position of the <HI>Gula</HI> being Horizon|tal, this Muscle is Compos'd of a Double Order of Spiral Fibres, mu|tually Intercussating each other; as it is Describ'd by Dr. <HI>Willis</HI> and Others.</P>

<P>B, The External Surface of the Gut with the last mention'd Mem|brane remaining on it.</P>

<P>D, The Orbicular or Circular Fibres plac'd immediately under the Former, which by Dr. <HI>Cole</HI> are thought to be Spiral, and a continued Thread from one Extream of the Gut to the other, by which means the Peristaltick Motion of the Intestines are continued.</P>
<P>By what I could ever Observe in Examining these Fibres, whether after Boyling or not, I must confess I could never be satisfied whither they are Continued and of a Spiral Disposition, nor indeed is it pos|sible to Untwist a Single Fibre if they were so Dispos'd, by reason of its Smallness and Collateral Adhesion to each other, by means of their Blood-Vessels; but on the contrary they rather Appear on very strict Examination, to be Semicircular, some longer and others shorter; by which means they more Adequately bring the Sides of the Intestine nearer each other, in Order to drive on its Contents. Be|sides this Office of the Muscular Fibres of the Intestines, by their Reciprocal Co-operation, they not only Compress their Subjacent Glands, and Drive out their contain'd <HI>Mucus</HI> to join with the Ali|ment; but by Collaterally pressing each Side of the Guts, they Open the Mouths of the Lacteal-Vessels to receive the <HI>Chyle.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Fig. 40.</HEAD>
<P>Represents a Portion of the <HI>Intestinum Iejunum</HI> Distended with Wind; its External Membrane and Muscular Fibres being taken off.</P>
<P>A A, Some of the Semicircular Fibres still remaining on the Inte|stine.</P>
<P>C C, Divers Small Glands scater'd at Various Distances between the last mention'd Clusters of Glands.</P>
<P>We are beholding to the Learned <HI>Wepher</HI> and the Accurate <HI>Peyer,</HI> for the Discovery of these Clusters of Glands of the Small Guts, as well as those Solitary Glands scatter'd up and down in the Large Guts: Tho' Dr. <HI>Willis</HI> and Others had mention'd a Glandulous Membrane of the Guts, yet it Furnisht us with no tollerable <HI>Idea</HI> of their Exi|stence and Office. They are supplied with Blood-Vessels, Nerves and Lympheducts, in Common with the Intestines and Excretory Ducts of their own; but I can by no means think the Nerves Import any Part of the Matter, which these Glands Discharge by their Excre|tory Pores, into the Cavity of the Intestine.</P>
<P><HI>Peyer</HI> takes Notice that these Glandulous Clusters are plac'd in that Part of the Gut, Opposite to its Connection with the Mesentery, but you will frequently find them near the Mesentery; yet I never found them in that Part of the Gut, to which the Mesentery is Con|nected.</P>
<P>The Matter they separate from the Blood, and Discharge by their Excretory Pores into the Cavity of the Gut, is very Tenacious, and since its Comprest from them by the Peristaltick Motion of the Guts, at the very instant the Alimentary Contents are passing by, it affords us no mean Argument, that it cannot so join with them, as to render any of the Chylous Particles more fit to pass the Mouths of the Lacteal Vessels; but that it only serves as a Vehicle to those Contents of the Guts, and Defends the Inward Villous Membrane from being Offended, either by Sharp Humours, or any Acuminated Bodies which often pass that Way.</P>
<P>The Glands of the <HI>Coecum, Colon</HI> and <HI>Rectum,</HI> which are Analogous to these of the Small Guts, differ very much from them in Figure and Situation; the Former lying in Clusters, whereas these from their Appearance, <HI>Peyer</HI> and Others call Solitary Glands; they being Small, Lentiformal, and very Numerous, plac'd from each other at Various Distances, not unlike the Stars in the Firmament.</P>
<P>All these Glands of the Intestines, as well as those of the Stomach, Liver, and <HI>Pancreas,</HI> are Affected with Cathartick Medicines, and Help to Discharge the Matter Evacuated by Stool; by <HI>Affected,</HI> I don't mean that the Purging Medicine bestows any Particles, immediately as it passes by them into the Cavity of the Gut; but that after its Particles are past into the Blood by the Chyle Ducts, it meets with a Fit Strainer in the Parts last mention'd, as well as these Glands by which it passes off again with the Serous Part of the Blood.</P>
