<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please Your LORDSHIP,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THOUGH the proof of Your ob|liging and generous Virtues hath fixed in Wisemen a confidence of Your favourable acceptance of whatever Wisdom and Worth (<HI>under the Patronage of Your endeared Name and Greatness</HI>) presents to the Publique;
<PB REF="3">
and that it cannot but be thought rather a cer|tainty then presumption, that You will treat those with ingenuous kindness, who are am|bitious to perpetuate Virtue, and to adorn the dead Monuments of it with all those Tropheys of revival and amplitude, which their greatest parts and most elaborate endeavours to that honestly-ambitious end can possibly arrive at: Yet may it (<HI>My Lord</HI>) be doubted how this enterprise of mine, by which I humbly (<HI>under the favour of Almighty God and Your Lordship</HI>) design to revive the Me|mory, and illustrate the Learning of that <HI>Ve|nerable and Profoundly-Scientifique Antecessor in the Office of the Chan|cellourship, Sir JOHN FORTESCUE,</HI> may be from my hand accepted, who am none of the first Three in adaptation to such a Service. But since it pleased God as to im|pregnate me with resolutions to attempt, so to vouchsafe me health to finish what I proposed in these Commentaryes, I trust Your <HI>Honour</HI> will accept the Protection of them, though they be but the <HI>Umbra</HI> and <HI>Eccho</HI> of the various
<PB REF="3" MS="y">
and transcendent Learning that the Text of the Chancellour <HI>FORTESCUE</HI> abounds with.</P>
<P>For truely (<HI>My Lord</HI>) had I not well|weighed my Reverend <HI>Original,</HI> and found in him that <HI>Pondus</HI> and Affluence of general and well-digested Science, which would exer|cise the pains and curiosity of a Gentleman and generous Artist, I should never have ambition'd the exploration of what God would enable me to, in so incessant a progress of study as this has occoasioned. Yet forasmuch as by the as|sistance of God I have in such proportion as his merciful indulgence has favoured my hum|ble industry with, perfected these Commenta|ryes, and obtained the favour and encourage|ment of an <HI>Honourable, Learned, and Grave Permission of them to the Press for publick View</HI>; I humbly beseech Your Lordship to pardon me while in pursuance of those primitive resolves of my first undertaking them (which was above five years since) I devote them to <HI>Your Perspicacious and Oracular Self, Whom of all His most Excellent MAJESTY'S Favourites and

<P>And therefore (<HI>My Lord</HI> there being so true a Parallel between my Noble Text-Master and Your Noble Self, <HI>Both Gen|tlemen by birth, Both Lawyers by breeding, Both Knights by degree, Both Wisemen by experience, Both loyal Attendants on your Sovereigns recesses abroad,</HI> and <HI>Both honoured by your Sovereigns with the trust and state of Chancellours:</HI> these Instances of likeness relating to, and uniting in you both, make me bold to conclude, that to no <HI>VVor|thy</HI> alive are these Commentaryes so properly

<HEAD>AN INTRODUCTION TO THE COMMENTARY UPON FORTESCUE.</HEAD>
<P>_BEfore I treat on the Text, I think it convenient to write somewhat concerning the Parties introduced, and the manner of introducing them.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dialogus est oratio, in qua disputantes introducuntur quot|quot Authori libis|erit.</HI> Cic. <HI>ad</HI> At|tic. <HI>lib.</HI> 13&punc;</NOTE> The manner of their Exhibition is by way of <HI>Dialogue,</HI> a form very ancient and significant, whereby Authours, as <HI>Trismegistus, Pla|to, Plutarch, Tully, Athenaeus, Aristophanes, Lucian,</HI> and hundreds of others, brought in such persons, and fictions, as conduced to the va|rious expression of their design, and the useful instruction of after-Ages: and therefore <GAP DESC="foreign">, which is <HI>the inward reasoning of the minde,</HI> whereby a man proposes things <HI>Pro</HI> and <HI>Con,</HI> as if really acted, is by <HI>Ruffinian</HI> ranked <HI>inter schemata <GAP DESC="foreign">,</HI> and he that skills this Art aright, called <GAP DESC="foreign"> so that <HI>Dialogues</HI> are proper Modes of Speech and writing, whereby one and the same person both frames Questions and Answers, under names and notions of Persons distinct and several. Thus does our <HI>Chancellour</HI> act both his own and the <HI>Prince</HI>'s part, laying down those Rules, which Ex|perience had taught him, the best Conduct and Regulation of life, and in producing the Prince as assenting to or dissenting from them, and so occasioning either his first adhesion to what he positively as|serted, or his further addition of such Proofs as should resolve the
<PB REF="7">
doubt, and make the Dose prescribed Palatable. So that in this Text, by the help of <HI>Dialogue,</HI> there is not onely a calm and plea|sant delight for Youth and Novice-wits, but grave and pithy Di|rection for the most accomplished mindes, who from it cannot but be enriched;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lilius Gyraldus, Syntag. 15. De Diis. p. 425.</NOTE> since, in <HI>Lampridius</HI> his words of <HI>Severus</HI> his <HI>Larari|um,</HI> it contains <HI>Christum &amp; Abrahamum, Orpheum &amp; Apollonium,</HI> mat|ter of all Variety and useful Institution both in Morals, Prudentials, and what's the most excellent in the knowledge of Things Heavenly. This for the <HI>Dialogue.</HI></P>
<P>Now of the Persons in this <HI>Dialogue,</HI> which are Two, and those under a pair of Illustrous Names, the <HI>Prince</HI> and the <HI>Chancellour,</HI> or as here they ought rather to be marshalled, the <HI>Chancellour</HI> and the <HI>Prince.</HI> The one apt and willing to teach, the other prone and ready to learn; which harmony cannot but produce a profitable and desired effect: for that heart is sure to be wise whose ear accepteth Counsels, and who turneth not his eye from the Precepts of Wisdome. Now though by the Lawes of Civility and Nations, precedency be due to the Person most dignified, and Princes of the Bloud have the Preheminence of Temporary Officers, where their Offices have not immediate representation of Sovereigns, their Masters; yet I shall crave leave to treat first of the <HI>Chancellour,</HI> and then of the <HI>Prince</HI>: because in this <HI>Dialogue,</HI> and as to this occasion, the <HI>Chancellour</HI> is the first both <HI>Ordine temporis,</HI> as the Commencer of the Discourse, and <HI>Dignitate sermonis,</HI> as intending to distil into the Youth of the re|presented <HI>Prince</HI> what his grave Experience observed necessary to make his Life exemplary, and his Government, when ever it should begin, successful.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chancellour</HI> I finde described three wayes, 1. By his Name, <HI>For|tescue.</HI> 2. By his Office, <HI>Chancellour.</HI> 3. By his personal Dignity, <HI>Miles Grandaevus</HI>: which represents him a man doubly honoured, from his Title <HI>Miles,</HI> from his Experience <HI>Grandaevus; For multitude of years teach Wisdom.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Forte Scu|tum Salus Ducum. Fortescue's Motte.</HI></NOTE> For his name <HI>Fortescue</HI> 'tis ancient and Knightly, possibly derived <HI>&agrave; forti scuto,</HI> which some Founder of the Family was espe|cially noted to have; either his Integrity which covered him from top to toe from the malice of his foes, who <HI>like cruel Archers shot at him, though his Shield, like</HI> Joseph'<HI>s Bow, abode sure through the mighty God of his Salvation,</HI> Gen. 49.24. or else from some more then ordinary Valour, which the many blows received on his Shield did amply express.</P>
<P>I shall not here engage in the Story of Names, nor take upon me to dive into the Well of Science to fetch thence that, which we would call the truth of their Original. If we understand a Name, as <HI>Logicians</HI> doe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tholoss. Syntag.

After whose Example the <HI>Hebrews,</HI>

So generally are Names given <HI>ad placitum,</HI> that it is hard to limit Names to Natures or Actions, when even fictive occasions have been Parental of them, and that <HI>ubique locorum,</HI> no Nation not taking the liberty so to doe. And at home to be ignorant of this would be our shame, when every dayes experience lessons it, and no man that is Clerk|ly, but knows, that Names are occasional, and varied as occasi|on serves, as Master <HI>Cambden,</HI> our learned <HI>Antiquary,</HI> every where in his <HI>Britannia</HI> acquaints us. Amongst us therefore in <HI>England,</HI> we have onely two Names usual, the <HI>Christian</HI> given at the <HI>Font,</HI> or <HI>Baptistery,</HI> by the <HI>Bishop</HI> or <HI>Presbyter</HI> ordinarily, as <HI>John, James, Robert, Edward</HI>: and the <HI>Sirname</HI> for distinction of the Family from whence Children descend. Both these are usually expressed in Deeds,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en dici putant quod rem notam faciat, sitque velut rerum imago.</HI> Ma|nertus <HI>apud</HI> Tho|loss.

And for this cause (if no other could be added) men are obliged in Justice to their Fames, Persons, Posterities, and Families, to own their in|dividual persons by those Names <HI>Christian</HI> and <HI>Familique,</HI> which they ordinarily go by; since as many Authours, not living to publish their pains, become unprofitable to the World, to enrich which they in their Lives and Studies were probably ambitious, as I think amongst many others, <HI>Julius Caesar Scaliger</HI> was in that Noble Compilement of an hundred and ten Books <HI>De Originibus,</HI> which are lost: or else others come after the Author's death, and thrust themselves into that praise which they never merited, and call themselves Fathers of those Speculations, which, if they could vindicate themselves by a Reply,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Epist. Dedicatory before</HI> Fortescue. Pitsaeus p. 597.</NOTE> would disown their impudent, and but Suposititious Au|thours. I the rather observe this, because in the mention of my Text-Master, not onely Mr. <HI>Mulcaster</HI> a learned man, and a Student in the Law, terms him <HI>Master Fortescue Knight</HI>: but also <HI>Pitsaeus</HI> out of

So that he was of a Knightly Race, and of so renowned a Gravity, that he was Chief Justice to <HI>Henry the Sixth</HI> for the latter half of his Reign; and, as appears by Records, that he might <HI>Statum suum decentius manu-tenere,</HI> the then King gave him an Annuity of an hundred and eighty <HI>Marks</HI> out of the <HI>Hamper,</HI> together with 116. <HI>s.</HI> 11. <HI>d.</HI> &frac12; <HI>percipiendum singulis annis ad Festum</HI> Natalis Do|mini <HI>pro una Roba, &amp; Furrura pro eadem erga idem Festum; &amp;</HI> 66. <HI>s.</HI> 6. <HI>d. singulis annis ad Festum</HI> Pentecostes <HI>pro una Roba, &amp; Linura pro eadem erga idem Festum</HI>: so greatly did this Worthy Knight de|serve of his Prince, that he was thought the meet subject of all Fa|vours. For he well demeaned himself in all Trusts, and as he lived no shame to his Family, so dyed he not ashamed of Fidelity to his So|vereign; for him he accompanyed in his misfortunes, and to him did he express the ardour of a just and ingenuous gratitude, in applying to his Son and Heir, whom he hoped should inherit his Throne and Dominions, such wholesom Documents, as best fitted him to sub|mit to God while a Sufferer, and to rule in the place of God when he should restore him to his Government, and subject his people and the guidance of them to him.

This Method, prevailing with our <HI>Chancellour</HI> in these words, makes me ready to write that of him, which <HI>Seneca</HI> does of his <HI>Fa|bian, That he seems to him,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mihi non effunde|re videtur Oratio|n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m, sed fundere.</HI></NOTE> <HI>not so impetuously to multiply words, as weightily, and profita|bly to express his minde by them.</HI> So compt, so seasonable, so peculiar to his purpose is this Courtly Frontispiece, that therein our <HI>Fortescue,</HI> like <HI>Seneca</HI>'s <HI>Fabian,</HI> may well be written of, as <HI>non negligens in oratione, sed securus,</HI> and his Book, to which this is the Inlet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seneca <HI>Ep.</HI> 100.</NOTE> be termed <HI>Electa verba, non captata,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Choice words, not wrested, as the manner of men is, from their proper meaning, but significant to the purpose for which they are al|leadged, and expressive of an high Genius, and a Magnanimous Soul, that uttered them.</HI></P>
<P>For here the <HI>Chancellour</HI> displays both the <HI>Prince</HI>'s Endowments, and his own Affecti|on to the Glory and Extent of them; that as, by the one, he appears to have tutour|ed a Noble mind, so, in the other, does he insinuate such Tuition to take the first fire from his Example, who loved the virtue in others, which was first ingenerated in him|self.</P>
<P>This Clause then, <HI>Gaudeo, Serenissime Princeps, super Nobilissima Indole tua,</HI> re|lates both to the <HI>Prince,</HI> and to the <HI>Chancellour,</HI> in the Expansion of it. To the <HI>Prince,</HI> as, <HI>Serenissimus,</HI> and <HI>Nobilissimae indolis</HI>; to the <HI>Chancellour,</HI> as affected with, and rejoycing for the futurity of good to the Nation, over which his Accomplishment was to be influential. This is the purport of this Introductional Artifice, which I the rather touch upon, because it is a Course both Christian, and artly, not to prejudicate our
<PB N="2" REF="13">
Success by rude Prefaces; but to make our ends on men in honest ways, through the Mediation of Favour, honestly begg'd, and readily, with Consent of those we ask it of, obtained. And, because the Cause preceeds the Effect in Nature's Order, and it will become us to treat of the Root, before of the Fruit, the <HI>Prince</HI>'s Perfections shall preceed the <HI>Chancellour</HI>'s Affection to Him for them, even in our Comment.</P>
<P>The <HI>Prince</HI> is represented first, as <HI>Serenissimus.</HI> Then, as <HI>Nobilissima indolis.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ser&eacute;nissimus.</HI> Antiently <HI>Emperours</HI> and <HI>Princes</HI> were pleased to be called by Names of singular Beneficence; <HI>Pii, Clementes, Mansueti, Tranquilli, Sereni, Felices</HI>: but, of late, they have assumed Superlatives to their Condecoration, so that not onely <HI>Iupi|ter</HI> had the Name of <HI>Optimus Maximus,</HI> but all Supremes are now represented by su|perlative Expressions, because they challenge sole Power within their Dominions. Hence comes it to pass, that though <HI>Princes</HI> do communicate many Attributes of theirs to men of Virtue, and Eminency (as to Patricians, Senatours, and Ministers of Learning, and State) such as are the Titles of <HI>Illustres, Spectabiles, Nobiles, Clarissimi, Perfectissimi,</HI> (of which <HI>Pancirol</HI> gives us a particular Accompt) yet the Title of <HI>Serenissimus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In Notitia digni|tatis utriusque Imperii, &agrave;</HI> p. 3. <HI>ad</HI> p. 20. <HI>&amp;</HI> c. 4 17.

Thus of old did Saint <HI>Leo</HI> term the <HI>Emperour Leo,</HI> to whom he wrote, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>To Our most glorious, and most serene Son,</HI> Leo <HI>the Emperour</HI>: and that, because Serenity in a <HI>Prince</HI> is that temperament, which keeps him aequilibrious, and properly qualified to rule, and all the Concomitants to it. And therefore though <HI>Herodian,</HI> to flatter a vile <HI>Commodus,</HI> may call him <HI>Nobilissi|mum Imperatorem,</HI> and <HI>Licinius Valerianus</HI> may, because none others will, give himself that Title; yet none deserves the Title of <HI>Serenissimus,</HI> but he, that, in <HI>Lactantius</HI> his words, <HI>in opere misericordiae largiter fecerit,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>He that is merciful, generous, and ha's expressed in his life,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>De</HI> Opi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ic. <HI>c.</HI> 15.</NOTE> <HI>and Actions, Perfect Virtue.</HI> Indeed Serenity being a Supralu|nary may well be accounted more then ordinarily of: nor is it so much a Courtesie, as a due debt, and homage to Serenity, to admire it. The Catholique Rational Nature conspires to pay a Devoir to this Deity for the Diffusion of its quality to every thing.</P>
<P>Serenity is that temper, that gives opportunity to all Virtue; <HI>and then is the Season to do worthily, when there is no Cloud, no Storm of Obliquity in the Minde, but all the Re|gion of it is clear</HI>: therefore all <HI>serene</HI> things were accounted excellent, <HI>aestas serena, coelum serenum, color serenus, lux serena, animus serenus, doctrina serena, frons tran|quilla, &amp; serena,</HI> yea, <HI>vitam serenare,</HI> and <HI>domum largo igne serenare,</HI> are frequent in all good Authours to express the greatest pleasure, content, and comeliness by. And therefore the Positive being so significant, its Superlative must have a supereminency of sense, reflecting most intense Lustres on a <HI>Prince,</HI> and prolating him, not as onely disposed to, but accomplished with the liberallest Proportions of humane Capacity, whereby lofty Nature is reduced to such an harmonious Mansuetude, as makes Ma|jesty comply with Meaness, and forbear those superb and monstrous Titles, which both intimidate men, and intrench on God's Patience provoked by the Arrogancy of them. For though <HI>Attila</HI> may glory in the Title of <HI>Ira Dei ego sum, &amp; Or|bis vastitas, I am the Anger of God, and the World's Devastation,</HI> and <HI>Abbas</HI> the <HI>Per|sian</HI> King vapour, that he is King of Kings, and Sultanies, Lord of the Imperious Mountain of <HI>Ararat,</HI> Commander of all Creatures from the River <HI>Corazon</HI> to the Gulph of <HI>Persia,</HI> Governour of all Sultans, Emperour of <HI>Musselmen,</HI> Bud of Ho|nour, Mirrour of Virtue, Rose of Delight; while <HI>Sapores</HI> vaunts himself to be King of Kings, Equal to the Stars, and Brother to the Sun and Moon; and <HI>Cozroes</HI> will be Lord of Lords, Prince of Peace, Salvation of men, the great Conquerour rising with the Sun, giving Lustre to the Night: notwithstanding the great <HI>Cham</HI> give out, he is the Son of the highest God, and Quintessence of the purest Spirits; and <HI>Prester Iohn</HI> challenges to himself,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Animosa vox vi|detur, &amp; regia. c&ugrave;m sit stultissi|ma</HI> Senec. <HI>lib.</HI> 2.

<P>Our <HI>Chancellour</HI> then meant much by <HI>Serenissime Princeps,</HI> yet not all that he had to bless God for in his matchless Pupil. To be of a towardly and pliant Nature, to be a <HI>sub|actum solum</HI> to virtuous Implantations, was a blessing, which the rough and sanguineous truculencies of some Natures abhorr: but to have <HI>nobilissimam indolem,</HI> a fertility, and profuseness of addiction to Good; to have, as it were, Good connatural to, and radicated in the very Free-hold, so that it is, as it were, inseparable from it, This is a noble Second to the former, nay it is the Parent of it, at least the <HI>sine qua non</HI>: for such most an end <HI>Princes</HI> prove, as they are in the Oar of their natural Temper. Hence the <HI>Chancellour</HI> expresses the accomplishment of the <HI>Prince</HI> by <HI>Indoles nobilissima,</HI> as the <HI>significatio futurae probitatis</HI>; so <HI>Tully</HI> uses the Word, <HI>Caesaris ver&ograve; pueri mirifica indoles virtutis.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. <HI>ad</HI> Brutum 3 <HI>lib.</HI> 1. <HI>Ep.</HI> 7. c. 12.

'Twere endless to mul|tiply instances out of Authours to this purpose: that only, which the Phrase imports, is a natural edg both to Good, or Evil; for <HI>indoles</HI> barely is applicable to either: for though <HI>Livy</HI> writing of <HI>Lavinia,</HI> understands her <HI>Indoles</HI> to be <HI>generositas quaedam virtutis atque animi</HI> (1 <HI>Ab Vrbe</HI> 9.) yet, when he uses the word of <HI>Hannibal,</HI> he makes it to Evil as well as to Good, <HI>cum hac indole virtutum ae vitiorum sub</HI> Asdrubale <HI>meruit.</HI> And therefore the <HI>Nobilissima</HI> here is not onely a Complement, but a Characteristical discrimination of the <HI>Prince's</HI> propension to Good, as his Choice, and that which God had so tinctured his Temper with that he could as soon cease to be, as not to be Nobly Virtuous. <HI>Indolem valent, quantum terrae proprietas, &amp; coeli, sub quo aluntur.</HI> And hence is it, that as curious and thrifty Planters, that delight in choice Fruit, do not onely preserve choice Seed, and choice Grafts, but also sow and plant them in proper Soils; that so their Natural <HI>Indoles</HI> may have no Alloies, and Debasements, but Additions from the Position of their Fixa|tion: so do prudent and diligent Parents, and Supervisours express their Affection and Judgment in the Nurture of Youth to Virtue, that, their Natural Towardness not being nipped and blunted, they may in time come to a virtuous Tapering, and to that pro|portion of Plenitude, which their Natures and Opportunities capacitate them to.</P>
<P>Which Connaturality of the fruits of Education with the Impressions of their Birth make Virtue so habitual to them, that they may well be called theirs as (by Divine Concession) they are the temporary Possessours of them; since by their Coalition with them, and their Appropriation of them, as their peculiar Treasure, they are onely and properly termed <HI>serenissimi</HI> and <HI>nobilissimae indolis.</HI> For though Titles, and Terrour may cause ascriptions of Perfection to Men, who otherwise as they deserve them not, so would not obtain them, Shews of Virtue, or claims to the credit of Her from the real Alliances of Her, to their Ancestours, is not currant Coyn to purchase the <HI>Prince</HI>'s Character here. For those remote and dubious Titles, though they derive faint and refracted lines from the Centre of Merit, yet are but the by-blows of its excellent Heroickness. They are as <HI>Monogenes, Pompey</HI>'s Cook somewhat like him, but not very <HI>Pompey the Great</HI>: they
<PB N="4" REF="14">
are as <HI>Serapio Scipio</HI>'s Slaughter-Man, not indeed Famous <HI>Scipio, Africk</HI>'s Master. They are <HI>Spintheris</HI> the despicable Player, not <HI>Publius Lentulus</HI> the Grave Senatour. They are <HI>virtutis umbrae,</HI> little conducing to <HI>Princes</HI> praise, but rather the Vizzard of such Deformities as seek, and take Sanctuary and relief from creditable appearances. That which onely is worthy <HI>Princes,</HI> is <HI>propriis gemmis coruscare,</HI> to see that the Virtue they pretend to, be <HI>vera, non fucata; propria, non aliena.</HI> For that the <HI>Chancellour</HI> here admires the <HI>Prince,</HI> as One <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat was worthy his Descent, and Degree, and thereupon He assures him the Serenity of his Mind consorted with that Noble Towardliness, which he undoubtedly discovered to be his Own, unstudied, unaffected, naturally His, had so affected him with Joy, that he could not but declare his thoughts with Gratitude to God the giver, and with admiration of Him the Subject of so much and so rare Endow|ment, <HI>Gaudeo, Serenissime Princeps.</HI></P>
<P>This the <HI>Chancellour</HI> adds, to shew the Sense Wise men have of <HI>Princes</HI> Worthinesses: for since they are the great Examples of their People, and have, as it were, the power of making them Good, or Bad; the preponderation of them to Virtue, which will be the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urn of the Common-Scale, and make it incline to the right, cannot but highly re|joyce those,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In</HI> Augusto.</NOTE> that rightly conceive it. <HI>Augustus</HI> was a brave <HI>Prince,</HI> yet <HI>Suetonius</HI> writes, he never commended his Sons to the People's love <HI>nisi cum hac exceptione, si merebuntur,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>but with this proviso, that they deserved, professing, that Honour ought to be the reward of Virtue, and not the Companion only of great Birth, and high Blood.</HI> For well he knew, that if the Wisdom and Calmness of their Minds did not balance, and over|bear their Passions, and make them tenable against Temptation and the fierce and too often prevalent sieges of it, they would do by their People, as that General in <HI>Cedrenus</HI> wrote he would do, in case their Good and his Will were competitours, <HI>aut mundus pro Imperatore</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Either the World shall acknowledg Me an Emperour, or I will make my self <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o, whether they will or no.</HI> Or, as <HI>Paul the Fourth,</HI> who was so great a Self|admirer, that he blushed not to say, that either he would have his Will, or he would set the World on fire, and go up in the flame thereof.</P>

And for men, they are usually estimated by their Company, Pleasures, and professed Engagements. And such is the rate of their Exchange, in the Reputation of men, as their Judgment is either dignified, or depreciated in its choice: <HI>Moses</HI> lost himself almost in the Peoples eyes, for chusing a <HI>Zipporah</HI> to breed upon; so course a ground they thought unmeet to draw a fair-figur'd Posterity upon; especially Princes, as they are <HI>altioris molis,</HI> and are the great Sea-marks, by which Subjects are directed, are to avoid indiligence therein: Neglects in them are ominous, and of tragick interpretation, because their Duty being <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>to adorn their Charges by Actions Kingly</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Adag. 1. <HI>Chil.</HI> 2. <HI>Cent.</HI> 5. <HI>p.</HI> 652.</NOTE> their <HI>Torpor</HI> is the hazard of their Government.</P>

Their Minds must be kept ever stirring, that through inoccupancy of Virtue they con|stagnat not Vice, which being habituated to men is not easily rooted out of them. Here|upon the Wisdom of these Architects is to raise aRoof of Action upon the Foundation of sober Virtue; to keep the Mind within bounds, and to spend its volatility on Corporal Exercises, which are of virile invention and performance. For the Tutors and Dire|ctors of Princes Educations, after they have seasoned their Charges with Letters, and secured their Breedings and younger years from the Censures of Illiterateness, prompt them to Corporal Exercises, and athletary Activities, such as are skill in handling the weapon, for defence of their persons (a very great ornament and security to any man of power and honour to excel in) not that he shall need either to provoke, or be provoked the more by it: for his Passion ha's no stimulation thereby, nor will his Skill betray him to Pride over others, because true Science abhors Boast, but rather keeps it self latent a|gainst a time of need, and proves a Reserve to his security against secret Attempts, and false Treacheries, which seldom are acted upon Princes of spirit, and Corporal Manlyness. Next to this, Tutors present to Princes riding of the great Horse, and the right ma|naging of them in all the parts and punctilio's of Cavalry; then they allow Justs, Bar|riers, Tournaments, Tiltings, or such other Manly Recreations, as are fashionable to greatness in the age of their life and breeding. And they at last allow them to try the proof of all these preparatory Inductions by Field-service; that is, such venture, as may display boldness, and bravery; but be as little in the Eye and Road of Danger as may be: their Design being not to end, but to enamel his life with all those embossings, which illustrate the Fame, and aggrandith the Military Virtue of arising Majesty. For wont|edness, and assuscency to any thing connaturalizes it, which <HI>Pythagoras</HI> gave us long ago the rule of, <GAP DESC="foreign">. <HI>To chuse the best way of life and custom,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plutarchus <HI>lib. de exilio.</HI> p. 602.</NOTE> <HI>will make it delightful to us.</HI> The experience of which, even in Military Affairs, rules the practise of great Commanders (not ordinarily to draw raw Souldi|ers, and fresh men into present service, but to put them into Garisons to be trained, and their best men to draw out, that their Novices, by the sport that now and then they have, may be gradually perfected in the Habit of couragious Boldness. Those <HI>actus Militaris</HI> then that our Prince here do's embrace, may be thought those onely; that are the Recreations and expressions of their spirits in times of Peace. And to these he is said <HI>to be not ably addicted, and affectionately acted.</HI> As well he chose, so to his choice, does he resolutely adhere; and this displays both Judgment and Constancy. A good Choice, and a grave Mind, not to waver in, or be cold to it: Levity is one of the Alloys and exuberances of Youth, and that which ha's so great a party in those early Flowers; that though they smell sweet, and come timely, yet they are soon gone. And therefore, the Prince young and wise, in age probable to chuse and chuse again; yet fixed to his first worthy Choice, deserves well the praise of his Tutor while he lives; as did such another Babe of Grace and Greatness, <HI>Iames</HI> the Son to the King of <HI>Scots</HI>; of whom <HI>Erasmus</HI> gives us almost an incredible accompt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Adag. <HI>Chil.</HI> 2, <HI>Cent.</HI> 5 <HI>p.</HI> 564, 565.</NOTE> concluding, <HI>Saetis demum dolori nostro, satis discipuli memoriae,</HI> deserve of him.

<P>There was much then of freeness and irritation in the desire of the Prince towards Arms; so that his Mind all on fire with love to, and valuation of it, testified itself, by hasting to, and embracing the <HI>Theory,</HI> as inlet to the practise of it. For so <HI>amplecti</HI> signi|fies here.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. <HI>De Oratore</HI> 120.</NOTE> And not onely <HI>cognoscere &amp; intelligere,</HI> but <HI>vehementer amare</HI>; so <HI>Tully, Nec quod jus civili (Crasse) tam vehementer es amplexus</HI>: so in <HI>Salust.

<P>So that all the result from this of the Chancellour in portraying the Prince to be Martial, will amount to this, that use and custom made it not onely affected by, but connatural to him: so that as <HI>Aristides</HI> could sooner not be, then not be just, <HI>Citi&ugrave;s Solem &egrave; coelo,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Sooner the Sun could be displaced the Firmament, then</HI> Aristides <HI>be re|moved from his integrity.</HI> So our Prince could as soon deny his Stomach food, or his Eye pleasure, as his delight Martial Exercise. And hence was it, that as to shew his forwardness, <HI>avidit as &amp; amplecteris</HI> is asserted: so to evidence him more led by sense and passion, then reason and speculation, this delight of his is rendered by <HI>Militares actus.</HI> For Youth is more pleased with Corporal Traverses, then Mental Agitations; those are introduced, when the Senses exterior are glutted, and the wild Oats are fowed, as we say; but Bodily Feats, as they are in Youth most seasonable and fragrant, so are they most delighted to express them, because Sense pleases it self in its perfectest model, and vivid'st Representation, which is that of the Body in Youth, when the Sails of the Skin are filled, and the Veins reaking hot with lively blood, and the Joynts uncti|ously motive with metaled Youth, and the Spirits energically diffusive, when the Circulation is uninterrupted, and the Violets scent in the Breath, the Roses colour in the Cheek, and on the Lip, the Lilies whiteness on the skin, when the Plushy Mantle on the Head, and the succulent Moysture of the Bones, rouse up to agility, and per|form creditably their undertakings. Then, then, are men chiefly delighted in, and carried to <HI>actus militares.</HI> Yea, then is the impression of Custome more durable when it's fixed on Nature's marble and adamant, which was the reason that <HI>Solomon</HI> advises, <HI>to teach a Child in the Trade of his Youth, that he may not depart from it in Age</HI>; it be|ing not often seen that vertuous Youths degenerate into vicious Old-ages. Hence con|sidering the Chancellour presents the Prince as so earlily generous, and so towardly inclined in his first Dawning as it were. I cannot but greatly admire him, and believe the Chancellour by these Representations of him was much a Votary to him. For, since there is nothing amiable in Man, but Virtue, because that has abundant remains of the image God, and the primeve Sculpture of omnipotence, so without that is there nothing less estimable then he in his degradation. And this was the sense of <HI>David. Man in honour abode not, but became as the Beast that perished</HI>; yea, the Heathen <HI>Agamemnon</HI> when by the <HI>Sycionian</HI> he was presented with the famous Mare <HI>Aetha,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plutarch in Gryll <HI>p.</HI> 98<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>Edit.

So dangerous a thing it is to give way to any evil, that, a battery and breach being once made upon Integrity, all the residue and remain of Virtue is in peril.</P>
<P>Well may the Prince then here be a person of wonder, and of the Chancellour's love, who gives up himself to such innocent and graceful Recreations, as are purely Princely, and become him as peculiarly such: for so it follows, <HI>Convenit namque tibite taliter delectari.</HI></P>
<Q><P>Convenit namque tibi te taliter delectari.</P></Q>
<P>This is added, to carry the Prince's praise to its true merit; 'twas not onely a good, but a graceful choice, that he made, proportionable to his quality, and station; his de|lights were not like the <GAP DESC="foreign">,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cent. 1.

Men of honour, who look upon themselves as born and bred for publique good, are acted by principles of suavity and munificence, consulting no accumulation to themselves but fame, no practice on men but that of Justice and Obligement; their delights are to be Patrons of Virtue, and Store-houses of munificence. This the Duke of <HI>Guise</HI> made good to his enemy, the Prince of <HI>Coude</HI>; for having taken him at <HI>Blainville,</HI> he so gloriously treated him, that they both supped at Table together that night, and after lay together in the same bed.

The Secretary from this understood his pleasure, and desisted. All this I instance in, to shew that what men chuse as their delights, are so commensurate to the addictions of their souls, that the one is discernable by the other. Our Prince then by chusing <HI>militares actus,</HI> as the subject of his embraces, may very fitly be saluted with a <HI>Convenit tibi, Princeps, taliter delectari.</HI> For he, in thus doing, answered all, that could be expected from him, <HI>ratione famae, familiae, fortunae, potentia,</HI> all which were either hopeless, or hopeful, as he proceeded to the improvement of this choice. For if the Prince fit still, and cry <HI>Leo in via,</HI> fearing to hazard his person to gain his right, he both contemns his Government, and animates Rebellion, upon hope of no disturbance for recovering it: and the infamy of such pusillanimity, being a Hell on earth, makes a brave mind kindle, and engage to recuperate, which if God pleases not to permit, yet he dies with the same of an honest valour, and a just resentment of his injured estate, and fells the Fine and Recovery against him at the dearest rate, resolution enraged, and desire doubly edg'd, can part with it at.</P>

Perhaps our Prince might not be so early a Knight, but one created either when he grew fifteen years, or before. Whensoever he was Knighted, is not much material; that such he was, is without doubt; and that such he deserved to be, according to the addictions of his manly mind, is plain from our Chancellour's words, which I take to be not pompous in courtiery, but real, according to the latitude, and very truth of its History, and accomplishment in him, <HI>Rex futurus.</HI> This is the other Argument on the behalf of Martial Acts, as our Princes choice. He was born the Heir of a Crown, and had Title to Regality, when God should disseise his Father of Regality by death; till when, the Prince was but a Subject: for the Law abhors depri|vation, or resignation,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Null&acirc;viverborum null&acirc; ingenii sa|cultate exprimi potest, quantum opus sit, qu&aacute;m laudabile, qu &aacute;m&abque; nanquam &agrave; me|moria hominum exiturum posse hoc dicere, Parentibus meis parui, cessi imperio corum, five aquuns, five iniquum fuit, obsequentem sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> miss&uacute;mque me praebui, ad hos unum contumax fui, n&egrave; beneficiis vincerer</HI> Senec. <HI>lib.</HI> 3. De Benefi|ciis <HI>p.</HI> 50.</NOTE> upon any pretense whatsoever, Allegiance being indispensable, and determining no how but by death. Now the Prince being by Inheritance, if he should survive his Father, a King, this <HI>Rex futurus</HI> is proper, as to that probability and the regality of a Title; but it had another sense also from our Chancellour: it is as it were a Prophecy of Loyalty, concerning the ruine of Usurpation, and the Introduction of <HI>H.</HI> 6. the rightful Lord, or at least of him the Prince (now his Father is dead) King. <HI>Rex futurus is indeed the voice of Loyalty, but it ha's an associated per adventure</HI>; because what we are is before, what we shall be behind the Curtain of Providence mysterious to us. 'Twas bravely said of our Text-Master, but he (good man) reckon'd without his Host, and was not a Prophet in the upshot: yet this he did, to keep up the Prince's spirit, to harden him against despondency, to rivet on him magnanimity, which erects a Kingdom of content in the very quarters of Crosses. This, I believe, he did, to lesson him, that power lost by Battle, is by Battle to be regained; that Princes fighting stre|nuously are probable bravely to succeed; that diligence makes those fortunate, whom dissoluteness reduces to want, and, what's worse, contempt; that if there were no other Argument to Courage, this were enough, that Princes are impatient to be the Vassals and Tennis-Balls of Fortune, and that their probablest Rescue and Restitution is from Resolution.</P>
<Q><P>Regis nempe officium est pugnare bella populi sui, &amp; eos rectissim&egrave; judicare.</P></Q>
<P>In this Clause the office of Rule, both as to War and Peace, is fet down; and this the Chancellour appropriates to Kings, as the meetest persons to carry on both good Of|fices. This was primitively <HI>familisrique,</HI> all power being vested by God in the Heads of Families, over those that were theirs by Generation, Emption, Compact, or Con|quest. And as the power of life and death, which was Civil Judicial power, was in them; so also was the Military and Bellatory power in them also; for, if they were to rule their Family, they were also to protect their Rule from inroads upon, and injuries to it. Thus did <HI>Abraham,</HI> very soon after the World's peopling, arm his menial servants, to propel danger from them, and redeem his captive Nephew, <HI>Gen.</HI> XIV. 14.</P>
<P>After when power was more publique, and increase of people dwelling together called for a Magistrate; the Sword, both to repel evil, and compel to good, was lodged in him as well by the determination of God as the consent of the people. This did <HI>Moses, Ioshuah,</HI> and the Judges execute, and after them the Kings, God having written this <HI>Sa|pience</HI> on man's nature; according to which, generally, all Nations, and unions of men in all places, and at all times, assented to the position of power in one or few, for the good of their respective Combinations. And, if the Holy Writ had been silent in this, there had been good authority for its practice,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quis erg&ograve; magis naturam rerum ignorat, qu&agrave;m qui optimo ejus operi &amp; commendatisis|mo hoc ferum &amp; perniciosum vitiu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> assignat.</HI> Seneca De iral. 1. <HI>p.</HI> 542</NOTE> merely upon the rules of civil conve|nience, and social necessity, which is an original Law, and paramountly takes place, as having its warrant in its weight, importance, and utility; nor could it be doubted, but the general compliance of the rational nature with it would have silenced all pretensi|ons to doubt about it. But St. <HI>Paul,</HI> from the Spirit of God, ha's partly asserted Ma|gistracy thus accommodated, as our Chancellour describes it. <HI>The Magistrate bears not the Sword in vain,</HI> that excludes power from being made a Cypher. <HI>If thou doest well,

<P>The Law then in the Chancellour's words, <HI>Pugnare bella populi sui,</HI> ha's this Inter|pretation, That the King is by Office to fight the Battles of his People; that is, by his people to battle, for the adjunct of propriety, ha's here but a sense of ministry, not cau|sality; that is, 'tis not to fight the Wars of his people, as they are Warranters of, and Regents in it; but of his people, as they are those Instruments he fights by, and fights for, since the end of War is Peace, as it follows, <HI>Et eos rectissim&egrave; judicare.</HI> This the Chancellour adds, to shew the amiable, as before he had the terrible Check of Maje|sty. So wisely ha's God provided for Order, and the tuition of the Magistrate's power, that between Force and Law it should be intermerate. Force supports Law, and Law moderates Force; were it not for punishments, we should be <HI>Ravilliacks</HI> to one ano|ther, <HI>Homo homini lupus</HI>; and were it not for Laws, Property would be determined by Might, and lame and helpless <HI>Mephibosheths</HI> be popped off with nothing, though they are the rightful Heirs, and ought to be the real Possessours of their Rights.

<PB N="15" REF="19">
which a good Conscience makes to its Possessour in all the vicissitudes, and varieties of life. For Kings being but men, and so under the Law of mutability and misery, do need, how great soever they be, the prayers, fidelities, and assistances, both by purse, and person, of their Subjects, as often as their legal and necessary needs shall call for them; and if they that are to pay and serve, love not their Lord, they will part with their money but slowly, perhaps after the season be past, and serve him but coldly, him in shew, and his Antagonist in truth: 'tis love, alas! mixed with fear, both subtilly, and yet innocently blinded in the gubernative activity of power, that makes Kings secure and beloved.

<P>Indeed, the pleasure of Kings is, in a sober sense, the Law; because Kings please to do nothing but Justice, the just Counsels of God being with them, <HI>qu&agrave; Kings,</HI> and they knowing, that they are accountable to God, for the ryot of the man, against the King, in them, ought <HI>so to demean themselves to their Subjects, as God does to the World,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rex est</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">.

And as God can do no injustice, because he is essentially just, and all Justice is originally in him, and what is in us, is but by derivation from him; so Kings are to do nothing unjust, because not onely so far as they do it, they are inconform to God, but for that they are responsible for what they do to God, whose rectitude they ought to imitate. <HI>Caveant igitur sibi Reges &amp; Iudices, n&egrave; conquerentes repellant, vel perverse judicent, ob quod in judicium justi Dei corruant,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 1. <HI>c.</HI> 17. <HI>Art.</HI> 10. <GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp;c. <HI>Idem loco prec.</HI></NOTE> <HI>ubi judex terribiliter discretus, &amp; intolerabiliter severus, immoderat&egrave; offensus, &amp; vehementer iratus, cujus sententia immutabilis, carcer irremeabilis, tormenta sine fine,</HI> saith <HI>Fleta</HI> notably.

And that <HI>Solomon</HI> here mentioned (for the eighth of the second of <HI>Kings</HI> wholly treats of him) is not a person less matchless, then is generally and truly presu|med of him.

<P>Now as to the Divinity of his Prescript, in that which our Chancellour here instan|ces, in the eighth Chapter of the first of <HI>Kings</HI>; which Chapter, having many re|markable passages in it, was purposely quoted by our Chancellour.</P>
<P>First, In it there is <HI>Solomon</HI>'s regard to, and valuation of the Ark of God (the visible sign of God's presence) expressed in the Assembly of State, that he summoned to at|tend its remove, <HI>The Elders of</HI> Israel, <HI>all the Heads of the Tribes, and the chief of the Fa|thers of the Children of</HI> Israel, <HI>unto the King,</HI> vers. 1. 'Tis not fit any thing of Gods should be passed over without due honour, nor his Ark change his station, without the attendance of a decent Equipage: Princes that serve not Religion with all their might, are not worthy the blessings that attend it. Therefore, gracious King <HI>Charles,</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="21">
our late martyred Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eiconn Basilie. <HI>pag.</HI> 212. <HI>art.</HI> 24.</NOTE> made a rare choice, <HI>Nor could I follow better Presidents</HI> (said he) <HI>if I were able, then those two eminent Kings,</HI> David, <HI>and</HI> Solomon, <HI>not more famous for their Sceptres and Crowns, then one was, for devont Psalms and Prayers; the other, for his divine Parables and Preaching, whence the one merited, and assumed the name of a Prophet, the other of a Preacher. Titles, indeed, of greater honour, where rightly pla|ced, then any of those the</HI> Roman Emperours <HI>affected from the Nations they subdued, it being infinitely more glorious, to convert souls to God, by the Word, then to conquer men to a subjection by the Sword.</HI> Thus he.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ver.</HI> 23, 24.</NOTE> Solomon <HI>the King solemnly pours out his Soul to God in prayer before the people, as not ashamed of the humility of a sinner, in the heighth of the state of a Sovereign.</HI>] Nothing de|bases Majesty but sin, nor disparages a King in his Peoples eyes, but flagitiousness: he can never miss acceptation with men, that first gains by prayer and humility accepta|tion with God: nor does he ever miss to finde God propitious, who seeks him with all his heart, and serves him with all his might.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ver.</HI> 29.</NOTE>Solomon <HI>builds a magnificent Temple, which he devotes to God, and which he prays, that God would accept as his own.</HI>] 'Twas not the King's prayer, nor the bounty he had ex|pressed in the costly furniture of it, that at all advanced those ends <HI>Solomon</HI> had in its designation: he intended it as a refuge to the peoples distress, and an oracular reperto|ry, in which the secret of God's power and goodness should be (as it were) deposited, which it could not prove, unless God ratified it for such: therefore prays he to God to grant his Petition, and to accept those services, that he and his people should in that place perform to him. Good Princes would willingly bring God and their Subjects to an accord, and leave his blessing as the guard of their government when they are gone&punc; There is no policy like that of Religion, which ever keeps God on its party.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ver.</HI> 55.</NOTE> <HI>The King blessed the Congregation again after, as well as he had done before his prayer.</HI>] To teach Princes, that their love to their people, should be ever in their memory, and that Religion is the cement of their reciprocation; nor do the Laws of Holy Church lesson ought to Prince, or People, beside love, and duty.</P>

<P>These are the main Poles, upon which this Chapter moves towards a fitness of di|rective influence on the Prince, for in that he ha's his life and breath from God, and even for his Crown, and Power, is but a Feudatary to the Almighty, who deals by Mo|narchs, as by Pismires, and exalts, or suppresses, as he pleases, in the Kingdoms of the World. And inasmuch as Kings have no readier way to preserve God their Tutelar, then by securing his rights inviolate, and by promoting the glory of his Divinity above all secular Projects, and extern conveniencies, as <HI>Solomon</HI> here did, and as Nature her self dictates to her very own Sons not enlightened by Divine Revelation, or Scripture-Regulation, according to that <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>The first care of Kings is that of Religion, and the Worship of God.</HI> In that, this wife and worthy Monopoly of devoting to God the totality of our prime and principal affection and reverence is in this Chapter pithily and particularly set down; and that it conduces, being punctually observed, to so much felicity and greatness in the outward state, parados, and pomp of a Prince, it well deserves the perfection and distinct observance of him: and the Chancel|lour ha's done wisely and faithfully to direct him to it.</P>

<P>This the Chancellour marshals in this order, to make good what he had formerly gained: for, as in the former clause, he had made the Prescript; so in this he subjoyns the reason, Kings, as mix'd persons of Mercy and Justice, are Keepers both of Laws and Swords, the purports of both Tables; and, being such, are to practice the activities of both hands, to apply Law to their ordinary, and force to their extraordinary admini|stration; since as Food and Physick preserve the Body-natural,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.

And hence is it, that the Government of <HI>England</HI> being so transacted by the Law, produces Justice, Riches, peace, and Piety, to a won|der.

<P>The use then both of Arms and Laws, must be connected in a Prince, that he may be indefectuous: For as Arms are like the Muscles, that move and plump out the joynts and proportions of the Body, that they are symmetrious to the beauty of the whole; so are Laws like the Veins and Arteries vehiculary of the blood, and succulency into all the parts, by a right orderly circulation, and distribution. And the counsel Laws give, is not to suppress the use, but advise to the right use of the Sword: not to condonate through easiness great offences, nor to punish passionately, and with severity, small dis|gusts and errours of infirmity; but to give to every offence its proper chastisement, to arbitrate the Law's Prescript, and become its Patron. This, while a Prince promotes, he declares himself an <HI>Agesilans,</HI> a rare Prince. For of him <HI>Xenophon</HI> writes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In Oratione</HI> De Agesilao, <HI>p.</HI> 66<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> '<GAP DESC="foreign"> &amp;c. <HI>That though he could do what he would, yet he d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d what onely he ought, professing himself to be under the direction of the Law, though not the subjection of it.</HI></P>
<P>Our Chancellour then had good reason for his advice, since he caressed, and smooth|ed the young Prince into the love of the Law; fore-seeing, with <HI>Timon</HI> of <HI>Athens,</HI> that if he were onely a Martialist, he might be as <HI>Alcibiades</HI> was by him fore-seen to prove, <HI>Patriae exitio futurus</HI>; so the Prince might, <HI>patriis legibus exitio futurus</HI>: since what Youth sucks in, it retains, and propagates in its Manhood, and Age: which considered, good Princes aim to do; as <HI>Iustinian</HI> says, <HI>armis decorari,</HI> to use force as a jewel for shew, <HI>ad faciendum populum,</HI> to purchase dread and estimation; but, <HI>armari legibus,</HI> to speak favour and terrour to subjects, in Law terms, <HI>per delegatos judices, non per ut lega|tos milites, mor&egrave; curiali, non militari, By Pen and Paper, not Guns and Pikes,</HI> the Pa|radoes of Conquests, not the practice of Civil Governments, except on extraordinary occasions, and then, as necessary as Physick, in bodily distempers.</P>

For God who had provided him such a Nurse-Mother, as a King's Daughter; such a Cradle, as an Ark of Flags, and exposed him to the ruffles, and hazards, of merciless Waters, when but a Babe, onely able to cry under the burthen of a helpless Infancy, shadowed out what he was, in time, to be, who broke out upon the World, through such a Mist, and Cloud of Dangers; which, when dispelled by mercy, evidenced h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to be what God appointed him, <GAP DESC="foreign">,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 2.

<P><HI>Moses</HI> is then here mentioned in both capacities, both of a Civil Magistrate, and a Martial Conductor.

of Heaven and Earth together, was but a little time Lord of those Conquests, obtained them by blood and oppression, and of them had far less then <HI>Alexander</HI> had atchieved, before he arrived at <HI>Caesar</HI>'s age: yea; what <HI>Caesar</HI> had, he held with Troubles and Conspiracies, and at last paid his life for the revenge of his affection, wherein the Se|nators were Assassines, and the Capitol the Slaughter-house: nor did <HI>Caesar</HI> obtain ever after such a Marble of himself by the largess of Posterity, as <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great had, <HI>Quod instinctu divinitatis, mentis magnitudine cum exercitusuo, tam de Tyranno quam de omni ejus factione, uno tempore, just is Rempubl, ultus est armis.</HI> No such Trophy to his memory, but a tacit reproach of his practice, in the Inscription under <HI>Brutus</HI> his Statue in after-times, <HI>utinam none viveres; Caesar,</HI> I say, was potent, but cruel; pre|valent, but injurious; and this made him execrable, and envyed. But <HI>Moses</HI> was an Heroick that might have had what he would, God in wrath would have extirpated <HI>Israel,</HI> and multiplyed <HI>Moses</HI> into a great Nation: but <HI>Moses</HI> interposes with God; and mediates for <HI>Israel</HI>; yea, was contented to be onely what God cut him out for, and general good would quietly permit him to be.</P>
<P>And herein he was himself <HI>fortior Caesare,</HI> and his example ought to invite more ir|refragably then <HI>Caesar</HI>'s did, because <HI>Caesar</HI> could not deny himself, taking what was takable by him. No sooner had the Common wealths divisions weakned opposition against him, every potent Patrician standing single, and the union of them refracted and subdivided into inconsiderable nothings, but <HI>Caesar</HI> puts in for the whole: No Re|conciler he; for then he had been <HI>felo propositi,</HI> but a subtile tent rather to keep the Wound open, till at last he and his party marched in at the breach, Victors; and when he was in possession, then he wins those by love, that would be made loyal by it, and destroys those that were implacable; and in this he did in his Generation wisely: But <HI>Moses</HI> had leave to chuse, and refused; might have been the Prince, but continued still the Captain of <HI>Israel</HI>; yea, when Fame surrounding his actions, and consolidating the People to him, rendered him more then probable, sure not to be defeated of their Ac|clamations, and complyings with his establishment, in all this croud of tryal, which bulges and swallows down ordinary mens continencies, and ingenuities. <HI>Moses</HI> stands firm to his veracity, and therefore in all things excels <HI>Caesar,</HI> as a Prince, and a Souldier: yea, if <HI>Iustinian,</HI> from whom our Chancellour cites the pre-alleadged Position, be the proper, <HI>Caesar,</HI> he means; yet <HI>Moses</HI> will still be more swasive with a good Prince then he. <HI>Iu|stinian</HI> did but employ his <HI>Trebonian,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lege</HI> Justinianum <HI>in confirmatione digestorum ante</HI> Tom. 1. <HI>p.</HI> 27. <HI>Et seq.</HI></NOTE> to collect the Laws of other men famous in their Ages, that is, to bring them into a body, and to render them useful to all occasions, of justice, and accommodation; and in this work was, though famous, yet fallible. But <HI>Mo|ses</HI> was taught of God to know, and approved of God, to practise the right duty of a King, <HI>ex utroque Caesar.</HI> And that this is so, the testimony of the seventeenth Chapter of <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth Verses following will de|monstrate,</P>
<P><HI>And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the Throne of his Kingdom, that he shall write him a Copy of the Law in a Book, out of that which is before the Priests, the Levites; and it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life, that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, to keep all the words of this Law, and these Statutes to do them; That his heart be not lifted up above his Brethren, and that he turn not aside from the Commande|ment, to the right hand, or to the left; to the end, that he may prolong his days in his King|dom, he and his Children, in the midst of</HI> Israel.</P>
<P>Which words contain two parts, <HI>Actio</HI> and <HI>Finis</HI>; the King's Action, <HI>He shall write him the Copy of his Law in a Book, which is before the Priests, the Levites; and it shall be with him; and he shall read it all the days of his life.</HI> And then the King's end in this, as prescribed by God, <HI>That he may learn to fear the Lord his God; to keep all the words of this Law, and these Statutes to do them.</HI> This is the Analyse of them, but not to be passed over:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tradunt</HI> Judzi <HI>circa hunc locum, qu&acirc; ratione, modo, &amp; ordine &amp; in qua item membrane quo demque atramente liber legis sit describen|dus.</HI> Fagius <HI>in</HI> Loc. <HI>Lorinus</HI> also reproaches the <HI>Iews</HI> for this out of <HI>Munster.</HI></NOTE> for though I wave the Rabbinique conceits, that this Law contained six hundred and thirteen Pre|cepts, three hundred sixty five affirmative, the number of the days of a year, and two hundred fourty eight negative, according to that computation they had of the joynts in man's body, which they perhaps conceived the King was to be remembred of, that he might know his life con|sisted of days, and his body of joynts, which might soon be severed from their contribu|tion

to life, and government acted in it. To omit these, and such conceits which learned men have, the Holy Ghost's drift is, to teach us: First, the order of God's dispensation to Majesty. He first gives them a Throne, and settles them in it; so 'tis their right. And then he <HI>shall write him the copy of this Law.</HI> Princes duties in their Oaths, Exam|ples, and Rules of Restraint, are subsequent to their Titles, not to puss up Princes in a contempt and disesteem of their Subjects, whom because they depend not upon, they may use as they list; but to lesson Subjects to look on Majesty, as God's Vicarage, no Creature of theirs; First, he is seated in his Throne, then minded of his Duty.</P>
<P>Secondly, the obligation of Princes, as they are <HI>Deo subditi,</HI> and <HI>vice Deiregnantes.</HI> First, to endeavour their own accomplishment, in this literal Prescript, to be able to write, that they may write this, that God commands them to rivet on themselves by such means. I confess, possible it may be, that a Prince may be letterless, hate, and be wholly ignorant of letters. Some have been such, and such not unworthy Princes in their actions: For that their Memories being vast, and their Passions keen, as by the latter they might be impatient to write, as well as impotent; so by the former, possible to reap the fruit of writing without writing; and the Spirit of God not so much look|ing at writing, as the means; as at remembring to do the end: I confess, 'tis possible much of the mind of God may be here observed by Princes void of letters: but yet in that, Writing is the probablest way of durable fixing, and the Holy Ghost specially en|joyns it, it were good, nay best, the letter of this Scripture should be observed, that thereby Princes may know the Laws of God, and of their Government.</P>

But I ra|ther conceive the former (yet with humble submission, yea, and without exclusion of the latter) because I suppose thereby the greater and stronger testimony lyes against the King, in case of violation by oblivion, since as the Gospel says, <HI>Out of thy own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked Servant, and perverse.</HI> So from thine own hand may God say to Princes, <HI>shall your sins be proved and reproved; Oftendam digitum, &amp; debitum,</HI> God marshals then our faults effectually, when Reason condemns the viola|tion of Religion.</P>

<P>This is added, to take away all Arguments of excuse, which Martial Natures are apt to make in Apology for their artlessness; they say, it effeminates the mind: Did it so in <HI>Moses, David, Alexander, Caesar, Iulian, Constantine, Antoninus?</HI> nothing less: nor did they allow all time to their accomplishments as Souldiers, Schollars they knew they ought to be, and onely could be by Study, and learned institution, and the Laws of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Jacob. <HI>c.</HI> s.</NOTE> and Men, as the Treasuries of that they read and considered, and this made them calm Governours, tender Parents, prudent Warriours, politique States|men, victorious Princes, and yet continues them in the reputation of Heroiques. Di|vide a Prince from knowledge and action, curtail him of either of those Diadems, and his Crown is abated; by how much either prevails against other, by so much is he pro|pended to the extream, which is the over-reach of virtues mediocrity. And therefore, as I hold a Prince ought not wholly to neglect Military Affairs, but verse himself in, and accustome himself to them, that he may intonate fear into Neighbours, not to pro|voke him to War, or to contemn him in his appearing; as vainly did the Emperour by the <HI>Swedish</HI> King, who was the bravest Hector of his Age; no, nor ought he wholly to rely on them, contemning Arts and Policies of Justice and Law; because they direct best how <HI>parta &amp; propria conservare,</HI> and are the nerves and sinews of success and ho|nour: but joyn them together,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>In Epift.</HI> De Ju|stiniano, <HI>Codice confirm.</HI></P>

<P>This is added, to restrain the King for the Matters of God, to God's own appoint|ment and institution; the Priesthood was setled on <HI>Levi</HI> by God, <HI>Numb.</HI> 1.2, 3. and no portion had <HI>Levi</HI> with his Brethren, for the God of his Priesthood was his portion. Now, God to put a dignity on the Priesthood, does not onely enjoyn the people to consult the Priest, who had the custody and knowledge of the Law; but even the Prince, he was to write the Law from the Original, with the Priests, called here the <HI>Levitical Tribe</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In loc.</HI></NOTE> not as <HI>Aben-Ezra</HI> thinks, to distinguish them from other Priests, which were not of the seed of <HI>Levi</HI>: for <HI>Drusius</HI> refuses that, upon the ground that the Priests were of the Kindred of <HI>Aaron,</HI> who was of the Race of <HI>Levi</HI>; but to keep us close to God's Ordination, who made the Priesthood the Repertory of Law-Learn|ing, <GAP DESC="foreign">, as <HI>Philo</HI>'s words are: And hence learned <HI>Grotius</HI> writes; <HI>H&igrave;s vero ratio habetur meliorum temporum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Grotius <HI>in</HI> Deut. xvii. 9.</NOTE> &amp;c. <HI>Here,</HI> saith he, <HI>is an account of the flourish|ing times of</HI> Levi; <HI>for then all controversies, judgments, difficulties, were brought before, and resolved by them; but afterwards they declining, and the incomes of the Priesthood be|ing great, and inclining the Priests to sloth and luxury, it fell out in time, that the Learn|ing of the Priesthood was translated into other Tribes, amongst which there were those that excelled the Priests in knowledge of the Law: so that the people did not onely wave the</HI> Levites, <HI>but even sometimes the</HI> High-Priest, <HI>and applyed themselves for introduction in the Law of God, to those that were learned, though not</HI> Levites, <HI>but</HI> Lay-men; saith he, out of <HI>Maimonides,</HI> lib. 2. <HI>De Synedrio.</HI></P>
<P>Though therefore the Priests misbehaviour, might eclipse their credit with the peo|ple; yet God's dignification of <HI>Levi</HI> is plain from Scripture throughout the whole Book of <HI>Numbers</HI>; and the Authour to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> mentions it in the fifth of the <HI>He|brews,</HI> as an augmentation of it.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib. quod</HI> Det. <HI>potiert insidi so|leat.</HI> p. 166.</NOTE> <HI>No man,</HI> saith he, <HI>takes this honour upon him, but he that is called of God, as was</HI> Aaron.

And therefore Princes enjoyned to transcribe the Law from their Original, were to apply themselves to them; so under the Law: nor is it otherwise under the

Gospel. For as God under the Old Law by <HI>Moses</HI>; so under the New Testament by who was faithful in God's Church as a Son, has ordinated an Evangelical Priesthood, not less conspicuous, then the <HI>Aaronick</HI> one; for, as that was ordained of God for men in things pertaining to God, as it is <HI>Heb.</HI> v. 1. as that was an honour to those that were of it, who were counted God's portion, as that had the dispensation of offering both gifts and sacrifices,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>De differentia</HI> Mosaici <HI>sacerdo|tis &amp; Evangel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i lege in Orat.</HI> Car|lerii <HI>in</HI> Concil.

Thus they an|swer each other; and in one thing the Gospel Priesthood excells the legal.

<P>Though I say the Chancellour might have illustrated the beauty and use of the Law from other Scriptures, yet in that he waves them all here, and refers to this Book, and this Chapter of this Book, 'tis a strong Argument, he thought it the most opposite to the Prince's instruction, <HI>Partem Scripturae politicam &amp; legislativam</HI>; as <HI>Aure<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lus</HI> his words are.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In</HI> Pentateuch.</NOTE> Well he knew, good Chancellour, that every word of God was good; but that these were like those of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Apples of Gold in Pictures of Silver, the onely words he could artlyly use to his purpose, <HI>Deuteronomium est quasi incensa, &amp; perpetua concio, e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">que de causa</HI> Mosis, <HI>c.</HI> 17. <HI>v.</HI> 18. <HI>jussit ut novi Reges, elegendique de|scribunt sibi</HI> Deuteronomium,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In argumento an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e</HI> Deuteronom.</NOTE> <HI>ut discant timere Deum,</HI> &amp;c. saith <HI>A.

<P>It's true indeed, every Book of <HI>Moses</HI> has his peculiar excellency, as it answers some useful end of God in the Production of his Designs there described: in <HI>Genesis</HI> there is description of God as the enjoyner of the Law; in <HI>Exodus,</HI> of <HI>Moses</HI> the Minister of the Law;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lorinus <HI>in pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fat ante</HI> Deuteron. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Beda <HI>In loc.</HI></NOTE> in <HI>Leviticus,</HI> of the Heads and Content of the Law; in <HI>Numbers,</HI> of the Na|ture of the People, to whom this Law was given; but in <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> there is a short Recapitulation and Conclusion of the Law given; the last words of <HI>Moses,</HI> most pithy, most memorable, most cull'd: and <HI>A.

First, for supply of Mortality, because all the old men that came out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and heard the Law delivered on Mount <HI>Sinai</HI> were dead. Secondly, because <HI>Moses</HI> was now to dy, and being to leave the people of his care and love, he leaves them instructed in the Law by this Copy, and perfect Accompt of it. Thirdly, for that the words of Rulers and Princes have most sway with the people they govern, he leaves them this Book, as the lasting <HI>Memorandum,</HI> and <HI>Iournal</HI> of their duty, and enjoyns Gover|nours to transcribe it, that by remembring it themselves, and ruling their people ac|cording to it, they may be happy and beloved as <HI>Moses</HI> was.

<P>Well did <HI>Moses</HI> know the temptations of greatness, that Kings are but men in na|ture, though Gods in sacredness; that Power is apt to arrogate a Prerogative above Mortal Restraints, and that the nature of man frail in them, is apt to pervert God's in|tention in the latitude of their Commission. Therefore <HI>Moses</HI> claps the Clog of God on the King's Conscience, and enjoyns him to read and write over the Law of him and his Government, as he will answer the violation of it through ignorance or perverse|ness to the God of that Law, in whose hand his life and breath is, <GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp;c. saith <HI>Philo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> De Nomi|num Mutatione. p. 1048.</NOTE> <HI>That his corrupt Nature being awed by God's Soveraignty, may by fear and aw of it be restrained from exorbitant rigours, and vain excursions.</HI></P>

In an evil fear, forbidden by God, perfect love casteth forth this fear; 'tis a fear of servility, not ingenuity; the fear of Bastards, and not Sons: 'tis the nail in our heads, after the butter and milk in a Lordly dish, which this World's flatteries, and the <HI>Iael</HI>'s of infirmity treat us deceitfully, and to our ruine. But holy fear, to fear the Lord and his goodness, is the felicity, as well as duty, of not onely Sub|jects but Princes: nay, 'tis paramountly pertinent to Princes, because the onely object of their fear, as a Superiour to them, employs it, and as a God to them, deserves it.

<P>This is well inferred from the presumption of its cause; to write the Law, is the way to remember it; to love it, the way to practice it; and to practice it, is to be what the Law here is told us to aim at, <HI>Fear God, and keep his Commandements,</HI> fully and con|stantly. This our Chancellour calls an effect of the Law, because the Law is in God's intention, and the ordinary way of his dispensation, thus to dispose Kings, as it offers them the Rational and Religious answering of the end of their Power, and his Pre|script: for <HI>Philo</HI> makes the Law as <GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp;c. <HI>God's declaratory of his Will,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> De Migrat.

And indeed, to this end has the Will of God concerning man its patefaction in the Law, that man might not be under any impossibi|lity of knowing what he is, and is not to do; nor plead ignorance, when his omissions and errour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> shall come to Arraignment: and therefore as here is much mercy in God's promulgation, so is there a call to us in it of eternal gratitude. For the Law written on the heart, and rivetted in the created nature, would have compurgated God from cruelty to his Creature, in punishing the breach of his Law, which they had such pre|vious and plenary warning of. But in that he has been pleased to write his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aw, and our duty, in such legible, and indelible Characters, as are learnable; not to know his Will by the Law, is to despise God from Heaven, and to sin against our Maker, and his Mercy. To fear then the Lord, as it is an act of service to God, so of mercy to our own souls, because it puts us out of fear of his fury; who is a consuming fire, who has power of soul and body; and it puts us into the protection of his promise, that <HI>No good thing shall be wanting to those that fear him,</HI> Psal. 34.9. And for asmuch as this fear is as in God causally, so in the Law institutionally; and <HI>Moses,</HI> by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pirit of God, directs Kings to the Law as their <HI>Academy</HI> and <HI>Oraculary</HI>; because they being <GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp;c. as <HI>Philo</HI> calls them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.

This, this is to know the Will of God, which is written in his Law; because this is perfect Charity, which is the fulfilling of the Law; and without this all the Notional and Grammatique Knowledge of the Law abstracted from pra|ctise of the duties postulated, is but nothing. So true is that of Saint <HI>Augustine, Pro bonis operibus sperastiterrenam quandam felicitatem</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In prima quin|quagena ex Pro|l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> Psal. 31.</NOTE> <HI>impius es, non est ist a merces fidei, cara res est fides, vili illam addixisti, impius ergo es &amp; nu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a sunt operatua, move as licet in bonis operibus lacertes, &amp; videaris navem optim&egrave; gubernare, in saxa festinas.</HI> So that Father; and so our Lord Jesus, <HI>If ye know these things, blessed are ye, if ye do them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Principium omnis famulatus, est scire voluntatem domini cui servitur.</HI> Here the Chancellour proceeds to confirm what went before, from the consideration of do|mestique Order, which is suitable to the greater Polity of Kings and People; nay, of God and Man: for in Families there is a Lord and Servants; the one commands, be|cause he is Master of all, and his Will is their Law: the other obeys, because he is bound, as he eats, drinks, is cloathed, and lives by, and under his Master. Now in this service, which the Chancellour calls <HI>famulitium,</HI> as after <HI>Festus</HI> he does, <HI>servus famula|tus,</HI> the first and chiefest thing is to know the Master's pleasure,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ep.</HI> 47.</NOTE> and to study, and actu|ally answer it, <HI>Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> cum inferiore vivas, quemadmodum tecum superiorem velles vivere.</HI> And because the Will of the Lord and his humour was best seen by frequent being in his company. <HI>Seneca</HI> tells us antiently, the Masters did admit their Servants to eat with them; yea, and that the Masters might see what tempers their Servants were of, and what commands could best bear, <HI>Instituerunt diem festum quo non solum cum servis do|mini vescerentur, sed quo utique honores illi in domo gerere, jus dicer&eacute; permiserunt, &amp;

<P>This was the state of Servants bound to obey; yet had they also a priviledge, when they were veteranes and faithful: For then, as they were <HI>secundi liberi,</HI> where Chil|dren were, so where they were not, they did <HI>in jus liberorum transire.</HI> To which pro|bably our Apostle alluded, when he made the priviledge of Adoption to consist in tran|slation from Servants to Sonship.

I know God by Miracle can instruct Kings, as he rained <HI>Mannah,</HI> and raised the Apostles from letterless Fisher-men, to learned Metropolitans, and profound Doctours. He can do by his absolute omnipotence what he will, and therefore is not obliged to qualifie Princes with fear and observance of him according to the method of Nature or Art, his Will being the Law: 'tis but say, and do: so the <HI>Chaos</HI> testified a passivity to his information; nor did in the pre-existent Matter ought reside, that had any refractory|ness in it. It did not, it could not appeal from his Will; for that had no superiour, no equal. But in that, God now discovers himself to us in familiar and natural methods, and leaves causes to their natural operation, ordinarily interposing no Power to suspend or impede the production of effects from causes; and inasmuch as the effect is first in nature of project, though last in order of time, the cause Physically precedeing it: Therefore the Chancellour advises to get holy and humble fear from the Law, which is God's un|doubted will to us; and that which we knowing, and doing, in such knowledge and deed shall be blest. This is the sum of this Clause.</P>

<P>Our Chancellour having wrote great things of <HI>holy fear,</HI> and made it, that <HI>Lucifer</HI> which shines in the Souls firmament, as an effect of God's Law read and practised, now comes to limit us to a right notion of it, that we may not mistake its counterfeit for the currant and noble grace of fear;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Timor filialis ori|tur &agrave; duplici ra|dice</HI>; 1. <HI>a co|gnitione divinae magnitudinis, &amp; a dilectione Dei</HI> Aragonius <HI>in S. Secundae, Diui</HI> Thomae. 919. Art. 2. De Timore, <HI>p.</HI> 264.</NOTE> and this he does, by distinguishing of fear, as a nude and rude passion, from what it is as a complex of graces, and a renovated prin|ciple, which makes us commensurate, in such degrees as humane frailty allow, to God's requiry of us in order to his glory, our Neighbours good, and our own personal and soulary felicity. For as it is not every Medicine that cures, every Suitor that succeeds, every Valour that is victorious, every Speaking that is oratory; so is it not every fear that is this fruit of the Law this favourite of God. There is fear that quivers through a guilty pusillanimity; there is fear that precipitates to a desperate ferocity; there is fear that sinks men beneath their station, into the stupidity of dull insects of sensless in|animation; fear that petrifies, and obdurates to an immobility; fear that lethargizes the spirits, and makes a man dead, while living. These fears may sometimes be useful, and God by their Revulsions work great effects preparatory to the fear of Worship and Reverence,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Timor Dei est me|tus reverentiae, &amp; cultus,</HI> A Lapide <HI>in</HI> Ecclus. xxiv. 24. <HI>p.</HI> 28.</NOTE> so often brings the terrour into the Conscience, and thereby pricks the sinner at the heart, letting out all the purulency, and impostumation of sin by its Lan|cet; and that removed, makes a kindly Avenue to his fuller work of Repentance and Conversion. In which sense, Saint <HI>Paul</HI> calls the Law, <HI>our School-Master to bring us to Christ</HI>: because as the School-Master cultivates youth, and weeds out by his Disci|pline all the trash, and corrects him for all the wilful breaches of his Rules, and so brings him at last into a pliant and regular temper, in which all after proficiencies
<PB N="39" REF="31">
thrive from their implantation to a great and graceful increase: so does God by toe|ling the sinner to read, and in reading to be taken with the terrours of the Law against the sin he is guilty of; so dismount and caress him, that for ever after he is a changed man; that as God did call off <HI>Paul</HI> from his eager <HI>Pharisaism,</HI> and Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> from his prophane <HI>Manichism,</HI> by the voyce of his power and mercy effectually touch|ing them; so does he often do by others, through the ministration of the Law; the threatnings of it being as so many voyces, and Counsels of desistance and abhorrence.

Therefore this fear <HI>qu&agrave;</HI> such being not of stanch materials, and loyal composure, is not able to fortifie against evil, and to provoke to good; not make the soul as compleat towards God, as the Queen of <HI>Navar</HI>'s accom|plishments rendered her to the World, when <HI>she not onely bore up the degree and esti|mation of a Queen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">D'Avila, <HI>p</HI> 363.</NOTE> <HI>though she had no Kingdom, but kept up her self, and built up the greatness of her Son, in spight of adverse fortune</HI>; but it flags, and renders the man that is acted by it mercenary, illiberal, and constrainedly onely good, being so far from enfranchising the soul, that it servilize it, and reduces it to an angustation of per|plexity.</P>
<P>Whereas the fear of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Greg. Naz. <HI>Orat.</HI> 53. <HI>on</HI> Eccles. <HI>p.</HI> 756. expresses it.</NOTE> which <HI>Moses</HI> magnifies as the Laws work in the sacred heart of Kings, is <HI>quasi auriga animae, quasi nauclerus animae, quasi specula animae</HI>; 'Tis <GAP DESC="foreign">, a salutiferous, but a rare endowment; and a good Prince applyes that of <HI>Synesius</HI> to the fear of God, makes God's fear the Philosophy he sets down to, <GAP DESC="foreign">, in <HI>Ep.</HI> 45. <HI>ad Herculianum.</HI> That which carryes him not <HI>Phaeton</HI>-like, furiously up to the Clouds of Pride, but Christianly, by the safe path of Humility, steers him to secure his immortal soul from those exitials that are occasioned by two much either of presumption or de|spair, gives him a Prospect of God in his Soul and in Heaven, in the Throne of his af|fections, and in the bliss of his divine supereminency; and by this incoats glory even in this state of mortality;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Lapide <HI>in loc.</HI></NOTE> which <HI>A Lapide,</HI> on those words of the Son of <HI>Syrach, Chap.</HI> 34.15. <HI>Blessed is the soul of him that feareth the Lord, to whom he doth look, and who is his strength.</HI> Thus descants on, <HI>parata <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st anima</HI> (saith he) <HI>sapientis tum in spe, quia per timorem, &amp; amorem Dei sperat cert&oacute;que assequetur speratam &agrave; se Beatitudinem, tum in re, quia beatitudo hujus vitae consist it in timore filiali, hoc est, in amore Dei, quia per eum fit amicus, filius, &amp; haeres Dei, &amp; cohaeres Christi, quare ut filius, &agrave; Deo protegitur, dirigi|tur, omnique bono cumulatur.</HI> Thus he.

<P>In this conclusion of his first Chapter, our Chancellour has reduced into a compen|dium, all that he writes concerning the subject of <HI>Fear,</HI> as the Lesson of the Law to the Prince. And, as in the former Clause, he shewed what <HI>fear</HI> the Law wrought not as its proper and most noble work, that is, in the effectuation it expresseth to the mind, that is taught by God: so in this does he set forth specially what it is in the use|ful and proper proceed of it towards a gratious and well-inclined person; and this he
<PB N="40" REF="32">
does out of that of the <HI>Psalmist, Psal. The fear of the Lord endures for ever</HI>: not by a duration of time; for the absorption of Faith by Vision, and Hope by Frui|tion, determines all <HI>fear,</HI> as it is in order to beatitude; for that being enjoyed, <HI>fear,</HI> the means to it, is lodged in its end; but <HI>the fear of the Lord endures for ever,</HI> that is, it makes the <HI>fearers</HI> of God so walk before God, while they are in the way to him; as that he shall take them into glory with him, and give them a coeternity of beatitude with him, which shall as little cease to be what it is, as his own Essence shall: so that he being for ever and ever his united to him by grace, shall in glory also have a be|ing and endurance for ever and ever, or else for ever and ever, <GAP DESC="foreign">, is an ac|cumulate expression, denoting a constant method of God in all distributions of his to men by <HI>holy fear,</HI> to usher in all their subsequent services. And this is but as the way to that he wages; whether one or both senses amounts, but to the acclamation of <HI>filial fear,</HI> which is the Oyl of Charity, the odour of a sweet-smelling Sacrifice to God: so far from being inconsistent with the Charity, that is, the bond of Perfection, that it is the very Charity, that is, the Bond of Perfection. Since thus to fear God, and keep his Commandements, is the whole duty of man. And this to do, though it does not <HI>paenam non merere,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Caten. Graec. Patrum, <HI>p.</HI> 439. <GAP DESC="foreign">. Isidor <HI>in</HI> Job xxviii</NOTE> as the Chancellour's words are, which attributes too much to the <HI>opus operatum,</HI> in the desert of it; since all our righteousness is but as a filthy rag before God; and when we have done all, we are commanded by our Lord to say, <HI>we are but unprofitable servants,</HI> and so no meritters, but demeritters. Yet does the acceptance of God's mercy crown this <HI>fear</HI> so far in us, that it makes us more then Conquerours over our corruptions, which are deservedly our fear, and entails us to the sure mercies of <HI>David,</HI> which are emanations of fidelity, and munificence inseparable from the fearers of God, because founded upon the veracity of his immutable Godhead. And hence it is, that <HI>Iob</HI> his determination of God's <HI>fear</HI> to be wisdom, and to depart from evil to be understanding, <HI>chap.</HI> 28. is literally and infallibly to be understood, as inde|fatigble; and the same is expressed to be, because it is the fear of the fontal and dura|bly wise being, and so is objectively Wisdom, and it worketh a practice in man suitable to the purpose of God in his Creation and Endowment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gregorius Theo|log. <HI>apud</HI> Caten. Graecorum Pa|trum <HI>in</HI> Job xx. <HI>p.</HI> 436.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp;c. <HI>A holy life is the first and most excellent Wisdom, and that which is most clean and acceptable with God</HI>; which is, to abhor and recede from evil, as God's opposite and Antagonist in his soul, and so argues understanding, and makes him subjectively wise, because wise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Jer. 13. <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Greg. Naz. Orat.</HI> 53.</NOTE> both the witness of wise actions, since sin is absolute folly, as God charges it in his people. <HI>My people have committed two evils; forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and digged to themselves broken Cisterns that will hold no water.</HI> So that the Law of God, in all senses, teaching man his duty, and quickning his endeavour by grace, imparted him to a capacitation of it, and a resignation of him to the conduct and empire of it, may well be magnified by our Chancellour in this first Chapter; and the Scripture he re|fers the Prince to from the Book of <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> of all other, be the most peculiar to the ends of his Instruction in the fear of God, and to the observation of his Precepts all the days of his life; saying of our Chancellour, as <HI>Synesius</HI> does of his <HI>Herculian,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp;c. If there be question, <HI>Whether there be</HI> Syrens, <HI>so long as your Instructions remain,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ep.</HI> 145.</NOTE> <HI>they will put them out of question, since in every line of them they have such melodious notes,</HI> as wholly <HI>Fortescue,</HI> the Prince, and render him unable for ad|miration to contain himself. And so I end the first Chapter, referring the <HI>Reader</HI> for the fuller satisfaction of the latitude of holy and servile <HI>fear,</HI> to the many Authours, whose Works have much of it; as they may be read in <HI>Fabian Iustinian</HI> his <HI>Index Universa|lis.</HI> Printed at <HI>Rome, Anno</HI> 1612. <HI>p.</HI> 529. and in the <HI>Scholemen,</HI> who generally have written as largely on the Head of <HI>Fear,</HI> as on any other common place whatever. And so I proceed to what follows in</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P><HI>HAEC ut audivit Princeps, erecto in senem vultu sic locutus est</HI>] because I look up|on these Dialogues, as to the Persons, as well as to the Matter real, and not fictive: therefore I term this Chapter the Prince's Replication to the Chancellour. And three notable things it is considered for: First, the Prince's civility, in a speedy repay of his love; <HI>haec ut audivit Princeps.</HI> Secondly, the Prince's preparatory pertness, to op|pose
<PB N="41" REF="32">
his youth to this grave and wise Chancellour's age, <HI>erecto in senem vultu, sic locu|tus est.</HI> Thirdly, the Prince's pregnant and pathetique Reply in the following matter.</P>
<P>First, the civility of the Prince's return to the Chancellour's counsel, is notable: no sooner had he a sense that he was obliged, but instantly he meditates the compensation, <HI>haec ut audivit Princeps.</HI> 'Tis true, men may have courtesies done them they know not of, and then their detinue of thanks, till they have notice that they have received kind|ness, is their excuse: but when a kindness is done, and so palpably, as we our own selves, are privy to, and convinced of the reality of it; if then we either do it not at all, or not seasonably, and while 'tis warm and fresh, we do amiss. For, as <HI>ingratum est bene|ficium quod diu inter manus dantis haesit</HI>; so is the thanks suspectable not to be real, when it is cold, and comes by grand paws, and tedious crawlings to those we ow it to. This our Prince abhorring, as knowing the suspition of ingratitude, too great a blot for Majesty to be branded with, suffers nothing to impede his thanks to the Chancellour, but sends by the same Post that brought the Narrative Packet, his recoil of acceptance, <HI>haec ut audivit</HI>: no Arrow as it were, is impelled toward the Mark; no thought ejacu|lated to its object, no volubility of the eye more quick, then this courtesie of his Prince|ly heart, <HI>haec ut audivit,</HI> that is, <HI>non citi&ugrave;s audivit quam retribuit</HI>; well knowing that of the <HI>Moralist</HI> was true, <HI>qui cit&ograve; dat, his dat</HI>; and that he who makes no haste, has lit|tle good will.</P>
<P>It is I know, a way, of narrow minds, to defer rependments, in hope that time may wear out the expectation in those that deserve it, as it does the gratitude of those that are deserved of: such spirits are frequent to vulgar births and brats of self-admira|tion, who are content, every body, should admire them, and as divine, offer to them; while they in no sort divine, are immunificent; no rain of their bounty, no sun-shine of their favour falls on their adorers, though their loves to them, make them their costly Votaries: all they sow upon this Rock, and commit to this Cormorant, is sure to be thin come up, though thick sown. And well it were, if such degeneracy were the botch and deformity of men of low degree:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ingrata patria non habebis essa mea. Dictum Scipionis.</HI></NOTE> but greatness sometimes has been capable of these ingratitudes; yet the Prince takes no president from them that are great, but not good, and have prelation above others in body and blood, but not in mind and vir|tue. Therefore his practice is to haste out of debt, to accept of what is in love presented him, and to represent himself the owner of it: this is the first thing, the Prince's acce|leration, <HI>reddere quod recepit, cui recepit</HI>;
<Q><L>Haec ut audivit Princeps,</L></Q></P>
<P>Secondly, the Prince's preparatory pertness is notable; pertness, in that he takes fire immediately upon the stroke, and kindles by his own innate candor, and the vestal touch of his gentle mind; and preparatory, I term it, because it was ordinated to usher in the subsequent matter, more conveniently. It was the Preface to the Dis|course, and the Porch to this Pupil-like entertainment of the grave Chancellour. <HI>Erecto in senem vultu</HI>; he does not roughly frown, or rudely grin, but gravely youth out his mind to his Instructor, <HI>erecto in senem vultu.</HI> Of all the parts in man, the face we call the Market-place, and in the face the eye is the jewel of it. Of all the senses of man, sight is the noblest; not onely because it is the Organ even of our Clarification in Hea|ven, and that which we see the face of God by, but because here in this World it is the instrument of our Earthly Heaven, Wisdom, and Philosophy; which, in <HI>Philo</HI>'s words, have their initiation from no other thing in us, <GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp;c. then from it as the Prince of the Senses;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> De Abraha|mo, <HI>p.</HI> 373.</NOTE> therefore, though he calls it small in bulk, yet he adds, 'tis that organ which views the great things of Heaven and Earth. Thus, as <HI>Phidius,</HI> to use his words, <HI>Did out of every material, make Statues, Gold, Wood, Stone, Iron, his Art appearing in every Figure, let the Materials be never so trite, that any one that had artly eyes might see him the Workman: so God the great Architect of man, though he has made him to consist of parts more and less noble; yet in the minutest and least glorious part has he instanced his matchless power and goodness.</HI> Alas! the face, it is but a ball of flesh, and the eye but a bubble, which Omnipotence keeps clear and plump; yet how inexpressible is the prevalence of these to captivate love, to search into art, nay to do actions, second in a sort, to those of miracle and astonishment.</P>
<P>But I say no more of the face, for that's <HI>ipsa oris species</HI>; our Prince is here said, <HI>eri|gere
<PB N="42" REF="33">
vultum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> De Orator. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">.3 De Oratore 12.</NOTE> and that's to present his Will, <HI>quae pro motu animi, infacie ostenditur.</HI> So <HI>Tully, Vultus qui sensus animi pler&uacute;mque indicant</HI>; and <HI>Imago animi vultus est, indi|ces oculi</HI>; and as dejection of Countenance shews a guilt, which <HI>Cain</HI> confirms after that <HI>fraticidial facinus,</HI> when God told him his Countenance was fallen from his brightness to be sad:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ep.</HI> 94.</NOTE> so erection of Countenance is a token of God's <HI>primaeve largess,</HI> and Nature's innocency resting in us. <HI>Ille vultus nostros erexit in coelum, &amp; quicquid mirificum magn&uacute;mque fecerato &agrave; suscipientibus voluit,</HI> &amp;c. saith <HI>Seneca.</HI> Indeed, the Antients, and men of wisdom in all Ages, have made the Countenance the Horizontal Line, upon which the <HI>Idaea</HI>'s of the Mind, and the possessions of the Regency there, turn themselves open to a perfect view; when there is a sad disastre, and a lugubrious uncouthness within, there will be a flag of defiance to joy, and gentleness in the Vi|sage; there will be <HI>ambiguus, ac consceleratus vultus,</HI> as <HI>Horace</HI> says; <HI>Quintilians, di|stortus vultus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 6. <HI>c.</HI> 3.

And when again there is contentment, and a virtu|ous habit; when all is placid, and averse to mischief: then there is on the Virgin <HI>Visual Table,</HI> the Inscription of <HI>Decorus, Dilectus, Hilaris, ingenuus.</HI> Then there is <HI>Ovid</HI>'s <HI>Laetus &amp; loquens nitidus vultus,</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI>'s <HI>Virgineus,</HI> and <HI>Placidus</HI>; and <HI>Claudian</HI>'s <HI>Comptus &amp; Coruscus vultus.</HI> In short, the face and hew of it, is an undeniable gnomon of the in|terns that reflect their beams of intention, or remission, of brightness, or obsuscation, ac|cording to the nature of them in their original: So that whereas our Chancellour ex|presses the Prince as erecting his Countenance on them; he concludes him pleased with|in, and evidencing of it in a conformity of looks on the visual superficies of so compo|sed a soul and sense; and by <HI>erecto vultu,</HI> here he means what other Authours do by the most benign Epithites; and what <HI>Ovid, Placido vultu respice mea munera.</HI> 2 <HI>Fa|stor.</HI> 4. and as one that did not <HI>addere vultum verbis</HI> onely, but <HI>praeire verba vultu ami|cali.</HI> He makes way for the main address of his gratitude in the following words, <HI>sic locutus est.</HI></P>
<Q><P>Scio, Cancellarie, qu&ograve;d liber <HI>Deuteronomii,</HI> quem tu commemor as sacrae Scripturae volu|men est, leges quoque &amp; Caeremoniae in eo conscriptae, etiam sacrae sunt, &agrave; Domi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> editae, &amp; per <HI>Mosen</HI> promulgatae. Quare eas legere Sanctae contemplationis dulcedo est.</P></Q>
<P>These words argue the Prince both gentle of nature, and satisfied in reason and judg|ment; that as by the one he accepted the counsel of age, so in the other he owns the gratification of youth, in the firm perswasion of the Chancellour's Arguments to be valid, and his quotations Scripture. And to make his ingenuity more transparent, I shall first observe his Assent to the Canonization of the Book, out of which the Scri|pture-counsel is taken; <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> that, he owns to be <HI>Sacrae Scripturae Volumen.</HI> Secondly, his Recognization of the Laws and Ceremonies in it as sacred, because part of the Canonique Scripture, <HI>Leges &amp; Ceremoniae in eo conscriptae, etiam sacrae sunt.</HI> Thirdly, his mention of the Authour of them, <HI>GOD, &agrave; Domino editae.</HI> Fourthly, his notice of the Instrument of their Promulgation, <HI>Moses, Et per</HI> Mosen <HI>promulgatae.</HI> Fifthly, the Conclusion he subjoyns, deduced from the preconcessions, <HI>Quare ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> legere Sanctae contemplationis dulcedo est.</HI> These, as the oratorious and pious Prelimi|naries to his weighty subsequent Reply, are worthy notice. But yet I proceed.</P>
<Q><P>Sed lex, ad cujus scientiam me invitas, humana est, ab hominibus edita &amp; tractans ter|rena: qu&ograve; lic&egrave;t <HI>Moses</HI> ad <HI>Deuteronomii</HI> lecturam Reges <HI>Israel</HI> astrinxerit, cum per hoc Reges alios ad consimiliter faciendum in suis legibus concitasse, omnem effugit rationem, cum utriusque lecturae non sit eadem causa.</P></Q>
<P>This Clause has the Nerves, Sinews, and Ligament of the Prince's reason in it, and had need of athletary and masculine Arguments to resolve and repel it. No doubt, the Law of God which <HI>Moses</HI> proposes, is that which has an <GAP DESC="foreign"> in it self, and ought
<PB N="43" REF="33">
to have a more then moral swasion on men, nay, a divine Empire over them, to be|lieve, embrace, and follow the Prescript of it; the reason is, because flesh and blood is non-plussed, and has no Rampier to raise against the Battery of its Divinity; God does assist it with such an inseparability, that no wit of man shall hold out siege against it; but if he be not sealed up to the day of destruction, shall yield up his reason and pre|possessions to it. No doubt therefore, but <HI>Israel</HI>'s King would hold himself concerned in a punctual consistency to it. God, whose the spirits of Kings are, was in it, and he dinted the edge of it, to cut through the oppositions of all argumentation against it. And therefore it was capable to teach the fear of God in God's method, and to the propor|tion of his requiry, because he fitted it to that end. 'Twas mighty, through God, to dismantle the strong Holds of Satan, and to rescind every obstruction that adversateth that end of God. It had a mighty Authour, <HI>GOD</HI>; and a mighty Minister, <HI>Moses,</HI> and a mighty appearance with Thunder and Lightning; and thence ought to have a mighty power with Kings, to teach them how to rule men under God, that they and their subjects may live with God for ever. But, Sir <HI>Chancellour,</HI> quoth he, <HI>Saul</HI>'s Armour will not fit <HI>David,</HI> nor will the Prerogatives appropriated to this one onely Law, be appliable to all, no more then the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Pharisees</HI> come up to <HI>Moses,</HI> be|cause they sit in <HI>Moses</HI> Chair: <HI>Moses</HI> was a man mighty in word and in deed, his Law was written by the Finger of God; the Statutes and Appointments of it were contrived in the Divine Mind; and no wonder, if they directed to God their Center whence they originated: no wonder, though they taught the Kings that were to be, what they might, and might not do, and possessed them with a fear to do the contrary, and with a care to do their positive injunction, in reverence to God the enjoyner, and to the injunction, as a part of his Worship. All the scruple is, How humane Laws that are made by men, subject to like infirmities with others: perhaps, <HI>Tyrannos, trucu|lent,</HI> prophane, per jurious. How these so weak and wicked should arrogate the autho|rity of God, and command indisputable obedience to their Laws. And how Kings that are holy, pious, and beloved, should be reasonably thought to read them, or be obliged to conform to them; since <HI>qualis causa, talis effectus,</HI> shrewdly presumes the Laws of vio|lence and injurious contexture and impression like themselves. This the Prince ob|jects, as holding himself not so strictly obliged to peruse the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> since they are but humane in their subject matter, and earthly in the objects that they re|spect. And this concludes the second Chapter.</P>

<P>THese words bring in the <HI>Chancellour,</HI> acknowledging both the candor in the Prince, and the favour of the Prince to him; which he the rather here mentions, because good counsel, and noble Precepts, have not ever such returns from <HI>Pupils</HI> on their <HI>Tutors.</HI> 'Twas rare counsel that <HI>Seneca</HI> gave <HI>Nero,</HI> in his Book <HI>De Clementia,</HI> which he says he begun and continued, <HI>Vt quodammodo speculi vice fungerer, &amp; te tibi ostenderem per|venturum ad voluptatem maximam omnium.</HI> And yet, though it had the sublimest strains of rhetorique love, and pathetique zeal to his aggrandization, that it might po|lish the roughness, and attenuate the superbity of his nature tending him to practices, as victorious over passion, and as obliging to subjects gratitude; as <HI>Augustus</HI> his was, whom he brings in as justly glorying, <HI>Praestitisti,</HI> Caesar, <HI>civitatem incruentam, &amp; hoc quod magno animo gloriatus es, nullam te toto orbe stillam cruoris humani misisse</HI>; yet had he no other answer but death from that patricidial Monster.

<P>Whereas then the Chancellour says, Laws are sacred, and adds, <HI>Lex est sanctio sancta jubens honesta, &amp; prohibens contraria</HI>; What doth he but speak, what God and Na|ture inspires him concerning it; for Laws being the <HI>inventa deorum,</HI> and the universal suffrages of Nature, propagating good, and impeding evil, are so deservedly accounted sacred,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Illustres conditores legum, inventionem legum in Deum, sed per diversa nomina atque media retulerunt, lege annumerationem Le|gislatorum apud</HI> Ficmum <HI>in Argum. ante</HI> Minoe, Platon. <HI>p,</HI> 564.</NOTE> as nothing can be more, because they are from the sacred being, example, authority, and tend to a sacred issue, God's glory, and mens good.

because they, as <HI>omissi casus,</HI> being not in the ordinary Canon; and must on that ground be passed over,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> De Joseph, <HI>p.</HI> 531.</NOTE> as if Magistrates were unconcerned in them. And this evil prudence, and self-preservation, the supreme Law, next that other, obviates, and that warrantably. <HI>Philo</HI> says Government is <GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp;c. <HI>a various and prudent adaptation of man to times. As a Sea-Master does not always steer one course, nor put out alike Sails, but varies and alters, as the Seas and Winds, and his Marchan|dizes, and men occasion; and as a Physitian does not always give one dose, but varies his prescript as the Patient changes,</HI> by intentions, remissions, repletions, all to health: so should a Governour order his affairs, as he sees best according to emergencies, regard|ing publique good, and mens profits. And this <HI>Seneca</HI> makes a most notable care of a Governour to prospect, so that he must needs no other eyes but his own to direct him. And hence is it, that as he proposes Laws, <HI>ad docendum,</HI> as well as <HI>imperandum,</HI> yet he improbates <HI>Plato</HI>'s long Laws, preferring short Laws soon learned, and easily re|membred far beyond them, and cryes out, <HI>nihil videtur mihi frigidius, nihil ineptius qu&agrave;m lex cum Prologo</HI>; yet does he suffragate to the use of additional Laws to those that are constitutional and primaeve, according to the requiry of extraordinary Occurrences,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Budaeus <HI>in</HI> Pand. <HI>priores,</HI> p. 194. <HI>Iura constitui oportte in iis quae</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>accidunt, non in iis quae <GAP DESC="foreign">, id est, iis quae pler&uacute;m&abque; accidunt, non in iis quae nec opinat&ograve;, vel praeter hominum opinionem.</HI></NOTE> which surely but for this, would be such an <HI>hiatus,</HI> as would swallow up all Gods and Mens Constituti|ons. For though it may be disputable, whether the World does <HI>senescere vigore</HI>; and many, on both sides, have variety and reason for their adhaesions for and against it; yet is it out of doubt, that the World, in the acceptation of it for men, the noblest part of it, do every day decrease in virtue, and with their new fashions, new habits and diet, introduce new vices; which, if not caution'd against by Laws, (slips cut out of the whole piece of pristine Wisdom) all that is sacred and ci|vil, will quickly be absorp't And therefore as <HI>Fabius Cunctator</HI> was by the <HI>Romans</HI> called <HI>Imperii scutum,</HI> because he taught them the way to master and ruine <HI>Hannibal</HI> by not fighting him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 1. <HI>p.</HI> 642. <HI>edit.</HI> Sylb.</NOTE> and for that was called by <HI>Iornandes, prima redeuntis &amp; revivi|scentis Imperii spes</HI>: so true subsequent Laws, woven out of the materials of Legisla|tive Wisdom, which the Antients had, and we from them received the principles in. These I say improved, are rightly termed <HI>reviviscentis sapientiae naturalis indicia,</HI> the amputations of vice and eradicators of pestilent annoyances, and Magistrates that carry them on to these ends indisputably to be adored.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Porphyrius, De Abstin. <HI>lib.</HI> 1. <HI>p.</HI> 6.</NOTE> And therefore that King amongst the <HI>Bramins,</HI> that made the Law against the venery of Women, by enjoyning that eve|ry Wife should be burned with her Husband, was an eternal Benefactor to the Nation whom he governed, and to the Successions of them: For whereas their Lust satis|fiable by others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Linschotten, <HI>in his Voyages to the</HI> India's, <HI>c.</HI> 36.</NOTE> better as they thought then their Husbands could, made them poy|son their Husbands, to enjoy their Leachers, and so filled Families with degenerous Broods: his Law drew them, for love of their own lives, to do nothing against, but all things for the lives of their Husbands, that they themselves might also live with them. And this was the break-neck of that Leachery; and so a good instance, that even by the light of nature, there is a latent power in Governours wisely to enact such Laws, as times, places, persons, and occurrences shall require; and such enacti|ons being sacred, ought as such to be obeyed, and that upon the ground that they are <HI>sanctae,</HI> because they do <HI>sancta jubere &amp; honesta, &amp; prohibere contraria,</HI> and have no name above their nature, but answerable to their appellation, according to our Chan|cellour's words, <HI>Sanctum enim esse oportet, quod esse sanctum definitum est.</HI></P>
<P>This I conceive is added, to discriminate just from unjust Government: in just Go|vernment, a just Law is the Rule, that teaches <HI>unicuique quod suum, est tribuere,</HI> and im|pedes and punishes whatever is contrary to it; that makes God and his right, mens aws, and expects their zeals to appear asserters of them; whereas other Governments set up wickedness by a Law. Nay, are set up to be what they are by wickedness; such a Government is that of the <HI>Turks,</HI> and was that of the <HI>Mammalucks.</HI> Now as the Government is, so must the Laws of its support be; for holy and righteous Laws will no better suit with unrighteous power, and unjust manages, then old Cloth will with new in a Garment; or new Wine with old Bottles, to use our Lord's compari|son. That then, which the Chancellour intends, is, that things ought in nature to an|swer their definitions; and if Laws be defined holy from the holy Sanctions, they are
<PB N="47" REF="35">
presumed to command, and the contrary to them, to forbid: Then the Laws ought to be preserved in their account of holy, from forbearing enactions that are diametral to ho|nesty, and of evil report. And on this ground the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> since Christianity, have not onely eliminated foolish Laws,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. <HI>lib.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>p.</HI> 245. <HI>De his quiser&egrave; &agrave; numine puniuntur,</HI> p. 550.</NOTE> like those of the <HI>Argives, that Women when they coupled with their Husbands, should put on Beards</HI>; or that of the <HI>Romans</HI> against their manumitted servants; or that of the <HI>Lacedemonians,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, that is, men should not suffer their <HI>Mustachio's</HI> to grow. Not onely have the Laws of <HI>Eng|land</HI> avoided fond enactions, but also eliminated all <HI>Ethnique</HI> Laws, and <HI>Dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ydize</HI> Cu|stoms; yea, and the Reformation has since refined things, which in, and under Popery, had at least negative legality, as dispensations for Leachery; and all this upon the Chan|cellour's Rule, <HI>Sanctum enim esse oportet, quod esse sanctum definitum est.</HI> Again, <HI>Lex est sanctio sancta jubens, &amp; prohibens contraria,</HI> is the definition of all Authours accord|ing to truth it self; as is proved from the fore-cited Authorities; <HI>Lex,</HI> not onely <HI>&agrave; li|gando,</HI> from the obliging nature of it, because none are exempt from its cogency as a rule; but also <HI>lex &agrave; legendo, quia public&egrave; legatur ut omnibus notus sit.</HI> For though of late Laws have been printed, and the Laity educated to read and practise them; yet in the elder times, the Laws were onely read and proclaimed from the authographon of their Entry, that all might at their peril take notice of it; which was one reason, I conceive, that <HI>Magna Charta</HI> being declaratory of the antient Common-Law which obliged all persons, was wont to be read not onely at the County Town by the She|riff, but also in Churches once a year at least, that all persons of what degree soever, though they could not read, or might not, if they could read, come safely to the sight and perusal of it, might hear to know it.</P>
<P><HI>Sanctio sancta</HI>] Not <HI>consensus populi,</HI> but <HI>sanctio Principis.</HI> For, though <HI>Plato</HI>'s rule be much to favour of People in formation of Laws; yet he fixes the sanctional power on the Prince as inseparable from him, as God's Vicar, and under him Legislator, and so our Laws do also. For the enaction which gives being to the Law-Statute, is the Kings; the consent of the Estates is but <HI>sine qua non.</HI> The Divinity of the King's Unction derives a sacredness on the Law; Subjects co-operation is but to frame them into useful methods, and to draw them to be obeyed more willingly, because con|sented to by their delegates in their passing. And to render them more probable to be just and wise, when so many Peers, of honour and learning, Spiritual and Lay, and wise and worthy Gentlemen, consider of, and consent to the enaction of them.</P>
<P><HI>Iubens honesta &amp; prohibens contraria.</HI> This I said was added to distinguish between Law and Law; for 'tis not the outward sanction onely, but the internal virtue, and the excellency of the end and drift of Sanctions, that makes them obligatory and cogent on men to obey them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Syntagmat. De Diis 13. <HI>p.</HI> 374.</NOTE> And therefore, if a Law should be any where made like those fore-cited, or like that which <HI>Lilius Giraldus,</HI> out of <HI>Herodotus,</HI> mentions among the <HI>Babilonians,</HI> that the native women should once a year couple with forraigners, for their recreation and content, that (as it were) they might the better bear the company of their Husbands and Countrey-men all the year after. This Law, I suppose, being so hard and obscene, so dishonest, and so unnaturally putid, would have no force on men and women further, then to make them suffer for disobedience to it; for since the Laws of every Nation are to accommodate the people of it in their way to virtue and serenity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. <HI>lib.</HI> 3.

<P>But I forbear more of this; though I think the Chancellor's Etymologie will not agree to the name, as it denominates universally the men, and is exegetical of them; for they do not always <HI>sacra dare,</HI> nor do they ever <HI>sacra docere. Ferdinand</HI> King of <HI>Spain</HI> knew that; for when he sent <HI>Pedrarias</HI> Vice-Roy into the <HI>West-Indies,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Naudaeus <HI>in proemio,</HI> De studio militari.</NOTE> he forbad him, <HI>Iuris con|sultos aut causidicos secum deducere</HI>; adding the reason, <HI>Ne litium semina quae illis re|gionibus nulla erant, ab ipsis importarentur, &amp; pernitios&acirc; contagione pacem illarum ac tranquilitatem interficerent.</HI> The like is reported of the <HI>Pannonians,</HI> that when <HI>Mat|thias Corvinus</HI> their King, sent for the best Civilians out of <HI>Italy</HI> to set over them, they requested the King to send them back again, and so he did, <HI>ad lites eorum ingeniis natas sedandum.</HI></P>
<P>Nor did our <HI>Sacerdotes</HI> trulier, <HI>sacra dare,</HI> or <HI>docere,</HI> here in <HI>England</HI>; for in <HI>H.</HI> 3 ds time <HI>William York,</HI> and <HI>Robert Lexington,</HI> pretended, as Justice <HI>Itinerants</HI> over the Land, to reform Justice; but instead thereof, exacted great sums of money from the Sub|jects for the King, contrary to the Law.

<PB N="51" REF="37">
and other severity, could possibly express, to their eclipse and diminution; notwithstanding all which, their loyalty and Consciences kept them close to the princi|ples of Integrity, which they are now deservedly compensated for, in the peace of their Consciences, the favour of their Sovereign, and the love of all good men: Which is a sufficient ballance to the levities of others, as well elder as later; and gives me the just occasion to assert a truth, to the honour of God, the King, and the Nation; That the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> distributed by the Reverend Judges, are with more integrity, and im|partiality, accommodated to the people then in any part of the World, Laws are: Nor is there any Nation under Heaven so void of corruption in judgment, as <HI>England</HI> is, wherein the Judges chosen for virtue, knowledge, and gravity, descended mostly out of Knightly Families, and endowed, for the most part, with great Estates. Neither need, nor possibly almost can, those circumstances considered, be suspected of favouring any thing, but Justice in their Judgments; nor fearing any thing, but to offend God, the King, and the Law; if otherwise then according to their Oaths they should do. And hereupon I shall use the <HI>Psalmist</HI>'s words, <HI>Blessed are the people that are in such a case, and who do receive the Law, &agrave; Talibus Sacerdotibus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sacerdotes,</HI> then, in a borrowed sense, Judges and Lawyers are; but in the true no|tion of <HI>Vlpian,</HI> and our <HI>Fortescue</HI> too, I suppose Lay-men were not intended to be expressed by it; for they did <HI>militiam poti&ugrave;s qu&agrave;m literas administrare</HI>; but in all parts, both of <HI>France,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">M.

<P>Which words contain an irrefragable Argument, for the sacredness of humane Laws made by a lawful Power. For the Chancellour being to deal in a nice point, wherein Carnal Reason, and Interests in Religion, is apt to byass beyond, and besides the one and onely mark of truth; the right fixation of which, having a strong influence on practice, and carrying a not to be retunded Argument of duty, to be obedient to the
<PB N="52" REF="38">
Laws of Powers for Conscience sake. This so necessary to prevent Murmur and Re|bellion, which first by derogation from, then by insolency against Magistratique Power, threatens, if not enervates it, our Chancellour backs and confirms from Scripture and Reason. From Scripture, that of Saint <HI>Paul, Rom.</HI> xiii. 1. <HI>Let every soul be subject to the higher Powers, for there is no Power but of God; the Powers that be, are ordained of God: whosoever therefore resisteth the Power, resisteth the Ordinance of God; and they that resist, shall receive to themselves damnation.</HI></P>
<P>This Scripture I have ever held the <HI>Magna Charta</HI> of Power, and because it hath such a pat and direct aspect on the supportation of it, Pride and Treachery have ever discharged their witty Canon on it, to batter, or at least abate the Obligation of it: nor were there ever more dangerous glosses, and religious cheats, put upon the literal truth of it, then of late by some of our seduced pretended Zealots, and their Theological Enthusiastiques. For though the Apostle has guarded this Canon of so great concern, with all possible strength, through which nothing but levelling fury, and Anabaptisti|cal Treachery can possibly break; yet have as great endeavours been made by men of more pretended sobriety, as could well, by wit and ill-will, be machinated. But this Scripture has, and I hope, ever will hold its own with all sober Christians, as well of these, as of the Primitive Ages; and so Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> defended it against the <HI>Dona|tists,</HI> who would disobey Magistrates, upon pretence, that God was rather to be obey|ed then they; which was true, but not in their sense; and then boast, they suffered for Conscience,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> De Corre|ctione Donati|starum, <HI>c.</HI> 6. <HI>ad</HI> Bonifac.</NOTE> and so were Martyrs, I say, as he reproached them, saying, <HI>Non ergo qui propter iniquitatem, &amp; propter Christianae unitatis impiam divisionem, sed qui propter justitiam persequutionem patiuntur, ii Martyres veri sunt.</HI> And again, <HI>Potest esse im|piorum similis pana, sed dissimilis est Martyrum causa.</HI> So that divers Orthodoxly amongst us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dr. F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rn.</NOTE> and by name, and very early, when the poyson of it did but pullulate, the late learned Bishop of <HI>Chester.</HI> So that considering, what is in the Text, and what has been said upon it, one would wonder, what confidence of man durst own so reasonless a Principle, as prophanation of this Text, endeavours to set up to the ruine of all Go|vernours, and confusion of all Government. For, first, the Apostle being to preach a Doctrine necessary for the suffering times of the Church, under <HI>Ethnique</HI> Princes, and rigid Step-Fathers, terms them yet Powers, and Powers ordained of God; and then knowing, men-sufferers would be tempted to stand upon terms, when they had multi|tudes to back them, and so would raise a purpresture against the Design of God in his Churches Clarification by suffering, and on the waste, and to the nusance of the Lords of these Earthly Soils, publishes obedience and subjection to them. Why; they are Powers, and higher Powers then to be coped with, or resisted by any their Subjects, while they command things lawful and just, actively, when otherwise, passively to be o|beyed; <HI>Si contr&agrave; Proconsul jubeat,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Serm.</HI> 6.

<P>This is a good inference, and carries a great Argument to the study of humane Laws, that they are, in a sense, God's Laws, because made by God's Power, and to God's end, order, and justice; and therefore as study of Gods the primaeve and origi|nal Law, whether <HI>Natural, National,</HI> or <HI>Mosaique,</HI> is the best adjument to the un|derstanding of those humane Laws, which are formed from them: so the comfort, de|light,

For though in the Laws of nature and men, there is mysterious abstru|sity, which toils and troubles the Learners brain, in perscrutating and understanding them; the effects whereof are visible in the morosity and separation of their Students, from the pleasures of conversation and diversion; yet are the events and issues in com|prehension of them to such degrees, as are consectaries and rewards of double diligence, very grateful, and perceptively congenial to the expectation of those excellent minds, who after busie disquisition into them, reap <HI>dulcedinem consolationis sanctae.</HI> There may God be seen in all his emanations and bounties to man, in the Work of the World, in the harmony and consent of Creatures, in a natural Worship of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quae c&ugrave;m se disposuit &amp; partibus suis consen|sit, &amp; ut ita dicam continuit, summum, bonum <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eligit nihil enim pravi, nihil lubrici superest, nihil, in quo arietet, aut labet, omnia fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iet ex imperio suo, uthilque inopinatum accidet, sed quicquid agit, in bonum exibit facile, &amp; pa|rat&egrave; &amp; sine tergiveratione agentis.</HI> Senec. <HI>lib.</HI> De Vita Beata, <HI>p.</HI> 654.</NOTE> and a noble conservation of themselves, in the various ex|pressions of virtues and vices, according to the differences of Cli|mates and Tropicks, under which Nations are, and the accidents of their Changes, Subversions, Discoveries, and Laws, in the preva|lencies of Interests, which hurry up and down, sublevate and de|press persons and things, as they are acted by the Furies and Con|cerns of their Entrigo's and Composures. These, and such like particulars, learned by study of the Laws of Nature, Nations, and Countreys, do so enrich and fortifie the mind against penury and ignorance, which the divinity of it abhors; that truly 'tis not possible to be a stranger to God, the chief good, and to be ignorant of the wisdom that is above, while we study that, which is revealed of that wis|dom, in these several things,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Natur.

<Q><P>Nec tamen, ut tu conjicis dulcedo hujusmodi causa fuit; cur <HI>Moses,</HI> Reges <HI>Israel, Deu|teronomium</HI> legere praeciperat; nam causa haec, non plus Reges quam plebeios ad ejus lecturam provocat, nec pl&ugrave;s <HI>Deuteronomii</HI> librum quam alios <HI>Pentateuchi</HI> libros legere, pulsat causa ista.</P></Q>
<P>Here our Text-Master prevents the mistake of <HI>Moses</HI> his intent in this Prescript to the <HI>Israelitish</HI> Kings, that <HI>Deuteronomy</HI> is referred to, because it, in the matter of it, or in the intent of God, relates to the pleasure of a King more then other men. For God and <HI>Moses</HI> in it takes no notice of this; 'tis an Argument which, by the bye, has a su|peraddition comes in, like that <GAP DESC="foreign">, our Lord mentioned, <HI>Matth.</HI> vi. 33. that which God and <HI>Moses</HI> from him commends in <HI>Deuteronomy</HI> to the King, is the <HI>utile dulci associatum &amp; conjunctum,</HI> the holiness, the justice, the conformity to God, which a holy and divine soul counts its chief comfort, and that peculiar erudition in the me|thod of Kinglyness, which from that Book Entry is perspicuous and knowable. For though all the parts of Scripture are full of Instructions, and savoury Precepts, directive to man in the latitude of his duty, and holy meditation will, by an effectual Chimistry, drain from them spiritual succulency: yet none are so fitted to a King, as those parts of it which treat of Kingly matters; <HI>These words, in season, have the beauty of Apples of Gold in Pictures of Silver</HI>; all parts alike, all parts of them beauteous. And there|fore 'twas not the sweetness of meditation, nor the particular affection that <HI>Moses</HI> had to this Book, as his <HI>Ioseph,</HI> that made him specially refer his love and direction of the

Prince thereto: but <HI>quia in Deuteronomio, plus qu&agrave;m in aliis libris veteris Testamenti leges inferuntur quibus Rex</HI> Israel <HI>populum regere obnoxious est, ejusdem mandati circumstan|tiae manifest&egrave; nos informant,</HI> that is, as I said before; because in <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> as the se|cond thoughts of <HI>Moses,</HI> the Laws formerly delivered but in part, and, as it were, con|fusedly, as the emergent occasions produced them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">onius <HI>in</HI> Claudio, <HI>c.</HI> 14.</NOTE> is compleated and digested into a fit and formal method. And the Prince that follows them, will know how <HI>duritiam mul|tarum legum ex aequo &amp; bono moderare</HI>; for as it follows,
<Q><P>Quo &amp; te princeps c&acirc;dem caus&acirc; non minus quam Reges <HI>Israel</HI> exhortatur, utlegum qui|bus populum in futurum Reges, tu sis solus indagator, nam quod Regi <HI>Israel</HI> di|ctum est, omni Regi populi videntis deum Typic&egrave; dictum fuisse intelligendum est.</P></Q></P>
<P>Still there is a perfect coherence in our Text, every thing ushers in its fellow, every antecedent word its subsequent, and that upon a reason of order; for in that <HI>Moses</HI> did not write this Law as a Prescript of <HI>Israel</HI>'s Kings, and determined the direction to them, in the line of their order, and succession of their Government; but made it morally typical of all Governours, and Governments, who thence should take pat|tern. Our Chancellour tells the Prince, the direction of the Law in <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> will reach him, as well as the Kings of <HI>Israel</HI>; and that God having given the Law as a Counsel and Prescript to all Kings, will require the breach or neglect of it from all Kings, as well others, as <HI>Israels.</HI> Indeed, some things there were delivered to the <HI>Iews,</HI> which were appropriate to them, and determined with their Oeconomy, the Rites of their Priesthood, the Judicials of their Civil Government, was literally limited to them, though there was some fiber and string, as it were, of moral duration and influence in them also: but for things that relate to conversation with God, men, and ones self; that, being moral in its nature, was adapted to the <HI>Iews</HI> as <HI>prior</HI> in time to us: but not more obliged by the bond, or priviledged by the franchise of it then others their Successours. And therefore as our Lord renewes the Precepts of old by his Go|spel mentioned <HI>Matth.</HI> v. and Saint <HI>Paul</HI> says, What is written, was written for our instruction. So may I say, in this case of the King, as referred to <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> God intended the direction there to all Successours to the first Kings in their Kingship, and to such enlargements of Governments, as time should discover, and power and pru|dence erect; and having done this, the counsel or command there reaches all in their duty to understand, attend, and obey it. And therefore the Chancellour proceeds.</P>
<Q><P>Autunc non convenienter utilit &eacute;rque proposui tibi mandatum regibus <HI>Israelis</HI> latum de eorum lege addiscenda, dum nedum ejus exemplum, sed &amp; ejus authoritas figu|ralis te erudivit, &amp; obligavit ad consimiliter faciendum de legibus regni quod annuente domino haereditaturus es.</P></Q>
<P>This the Chancellour concludes with as a reddition of the premises, with an appeal to his reason, for justification of his service to the Prince's accomplishment therein; no vain ayrie Romance, no nugatory delight, no sordid mendication is preferred by our Chancellour; those would weaken, not fortifie, the Prince's mind; and beweed, not cultivate it to an artly trimness; that which he promotes, is apparently worthy. 'Tis the Law of God, Nature, Nations, and what is as becoming him, to observe as any of these, because these all brought into, and become the Law of his Government. Now this so antient, exact, approved, idoneous esteemed, as he conveniently, so profitably presenting to him, was a good office, without all doubt or peradventure: many things, experience tells us, are convenient, but not profitable, (if profit be calculated accord|ing to the common notion) many things are profitable, but not convenient: but this being profitable for the nature, and convenient for the season, deserves to derive an honour on the giver, and oblige the receiver to a gratitude. And with this he ends his third Chapter.</P>

<P>HEre the Chancellour prosecutes his precedent Argument for the Laws, by shew|ing, that the Laws of Government,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">, Theolog. <HI>apud</HI> Stobaeum, <HI>Serm.</HI> 210. <HI>p.</HI> 703.</NOTE> and especially those of <HI>England,</HI> the marrow of all the fore-mentioned Laws, do not onely instruct Princes in the way of Religion to God, and of Justice to men; but also of self-conservancy, by a well-ordered virtue, and a through-paced prudence, to attain temporal felicity of state and mind. And the better to possess the Prince with the opinion, that this the Law does, he engages him to the belief and tryal of them by these gradations.</P>
<P>First, in that he complements him, as <HI>Princeps colendissimus,</HI> he does bespeak him to love and follow the Law as that was has all the learning of right living, and just go|verning in it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Natur. Deo|rum. Cic. <HI>post r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">di|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">um.</HI></NOTE> and that which makes men submit willingly to, and venture resolutely for him, men being apt <HI>pi&egrave; san&eacute;ctque colere naturam excellentem &amp; prastantem,</HI> as <HI>Tully</HI> has it, and <HI>memoriam beneficii colere memori&acirc; sempetern&acirc;,</HI> as the same Orator: For though <HI>nobilissimus,</HI> and <HI>clarissimus,</HI> may make men dreaded and awed; yet <HI>colendissi|mus</HI> supposes a virtue, which seises on the Reason of man, and aws his Conscience, and thence works a divine veneration, performed to a Prince, as a mortal God, whom Religion commands to honour, because good, just, merciful, as well as because great, terrible, and not to be resisted.</P>
<P>Secondly, in that he proposes the Laws of Government, as founded upon the Law of God, Nature, and Nations, to be prescriptive of all virtue, accumulated in the fear of God, <HI>the beginning of wisdom,</HI> and applyes that Text, which King <HI>David</HI> spake as a Prophet to the Law, as hers, in his mouth; <HI>Come my Children, hearken to me, I will teach you the fear of the Lord.</HI> Words of weight and wisdom, like those the <HI>Moralist</HI> calls for,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ep.</HI> 75.

<P>Thirdly, in that he works upon passions of love and desire, which the Prince, as man, and young, might have eager set on felicity and blessedness, as attainable by this fear of God, wrought in him by the Law. This is to decorate, and introduce the Law into his love, by that <HI>lata porta,</HI> which is august, and by an entertainment of amplitude. In|deed, the Chancellour herein seems more happy,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ep.</HI> 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> then <HI>Seneca</HI> thought himself, when he was discoursing of <HI>Plato, Mille res inciderunt, cum fort&egrave; de Platone loqueremur, quae nomina desiderarent nec haberent</HI>; for whereas that <HI>Rhetorician</HI> had an excellent person to speak of, but by exility of words failed in a reddition of him commensurate to his merit, and his mentioners intendment and ambition, to evidence, our Text-Master, as writing of a better subject, <HI>the Laws,</HI> then he did of a <HI>Plato,</HI> who was but a man, <HI>passant</HI> through the Zodiaque of mutability and infirmity, neither wants words to wast his matter in, nor matter to ballast and carry his Reason to his Readers perswa|sion; but having <HI>temperamentum ad pondus,</HI> produces it to a very serious and savoury purpose, telling him, that though life was short, and felicity in, and beatitude after this life, was the instigation and reward of all Endeavours in Kings and Com|moners, <GAP DESC="foreign">,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. <HI>Lib.</HI> De Py|thiae Oraculis, <HI>p.</HI> 401.</NOTE> &amp;c. <HI>that Princes must devote to God Altars of Iustice, Temperance, Magnani<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>not of Gold and Silver, but of Virtue, which they

fear more then he ought, nor endeavour to do otherwise to God, Man, or himself, then as perfect virtue limits. This is the <HI>perfectus usus virtutum,</HI> which Saint <HI>Paul</HI> translates <HI>into carrying a Conscience void of offence both towards God, and towards man.</HI> But Saint <HI>Paul</HI>'s definition of it, transcending the <HI>Heathen</HI>'s notion, is not to be insisted on as <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s meaning, which went no further, then that before-mentioned.

But I refer the Reader to them, avoiding the superfluity of quoting them here, and concluding with that of <HI>Philo,</HI> that God doing all things like himself in weight and measure, <GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp;c. <HI>indulges his Creature nothing defective beneath perfect, though not in the ab|solute and exact act, yet in such degrees as he accepts perfect.</HI> And thus <HI>Noah, Daniel, Iob,</HI> and others have been accounted perfect by him, and been blessed, in such the perfect use of virtue, from him.</P>
<P><HI>His jam praesuppositis considerare te volo, etiam ea quae sequuntur leges humanae, non aliud sunt qu&agrave;m regula quibus perfect&egrave; justitia edocetur.</HI>] This is to set forth, that as beatitude is attainable by virtue, so virtue is by knowledge of the Law: And as all virtue, so that, which though inclusively, is general; yet, in common understanding, one particular justice. This the Law inclines to, and teaches a Prince so the method of, as nothing else besides it can, or does. For Laws being the wisdom of Ages, and men having such additions, and subtractions, as make their compilements symmetrious to their end, must needs be the most faithful, and unerring Counsellours, which has caused Monarchs, in power and wisdom, to dye for Laws, and the <GAP DESC="foreign">, as well as for Religion, because Religion and they, directing one rule of Justice equally, call for cou|rage and constancy in mens observance of them. Now, though it were too bold a con|fidence, for any one to arrogate this rule of perfect justice to any single body of hu|mane Law; yet it is well-beseeming a sober man, to own the Chancellour in his vin|dication of humane Laws as such; because some, or other Laws of men, do supply what others want; and so amongst them, while yet they are together, but <HI>humanae leges,</HI> do notwithstanding <HI>perfecte justitiam edocere.</HI> For since the Rule of Justice with men, is the Laws of their Government, and the topique Customs of the place of their being, and those are knowable by study and practice, and the knowledge of them in both kind; is the perfectest acquisition, our nature is capable of. In the same sense they may perfectly be known, may they be accounted perfect Rules of virtue; since the vir|tue perfected in us by the Law, is but a conformity in practice to the speculation we have of it. And hence it is, that, as in common speech, we call that &aacute; perfect Copy, which is <HI>verbatim</HI> to the original; and that a perfect Child which has all the integral parts, and that a perfect book which has no leaves torn out: so the Law may be taken for a perfect Mistriss of Justice, when it gives, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Rules for Iustice,</HI> and is as inde|fectuous in it, as integrity of method and prudence, equity and exactness, composed by man, and generally approved by experience, can arrive at; which <HI>Budaeus</HI> well expres|ses, <HI>Quod in legibus; senatus consultis, rebus judicatis, juris peritorum authoritate,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In</HI> Pandect.

And hence is it, that he calls Laws, Rules; now Rules do not in|cline to things, but things conform to Rules; because there is no ametry in Rules, but a fixed and exact rectitude, Rules being truth adapted to ends of use, and tracks, according to Wisdoms discovery of her self, in the practiques of Sciences and Mysteries: so the Laws, as Rules, are not to condescend to mens mutable humours, but to retain their majesty, and immobility, as Rules do, and ought; allowing always Rea|son and Magistracy regent in it, liberty, <HI>in licitis &amp; honestis,</HI> to alter, as Prudence ad|vises, and Providence, in affairs, shall over-rule them.</P>
<P>While then Laws are Rules, and such as do <HI>perfect&egrave; justitiam edocere,</HI> they must be of high descent, <HI>From the Father of Lights,</HI> larded with virtue and wisdom, in every part and nook of them: not framed, as if <HI>Epicurus</HI> were their Patron, who taught, that nothing was just, <HI>su&acirc; natur&acirc; sed metu</HI>: or according to <HI>Thrasimachus</HI> his latitude, whom <HI>Plato</HI> brings in,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 1.

<PB N="63" REF="43">
&amp; regulam</HI>; heights <HI>ad perpendiculum</HI>; and corners, <HI>ad normam,</HI> and respond they all must to these, or else there is not just mensuration. So does our Chancellour, in terming the Law a Rule, refer perfect virtue to it, as well to be gain'd by, as prote|cted in it. Nor is there any virtue learnable by any man, but what the Law can, and will teach him, if he will hear, and obey it.</P>
<P>And as <HI>Demosthenes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ep.</HI> 203.</NOTE> whom <HI>Pliny</HI> stiles, <HI>ille norma Oratoris &amp; regula,</HI> had not been an Orator so eminent; nor at all, if he had not conformed <HI>norma loquendi.</HI> Nor he, in <HI>Tully,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pro Muraena, 2.</NOTE> a good man, had he not resolved, <HI>Dirigere vitam ad normam rationis.</HI> So can|not the Prince be, what be ought in charity to be; good to his own soul, <HI>nisi servat&acirc; ill&acirc;, qua quasi delapsa de caelo est, ad cognitionem omnium regul&acirc;, ad quam omnia judicia rerum dirigentur</HI>; as <HI>Tully</HI> smartly.</P>
<P>Which considered,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 1.

<P>Here our Master disclaims that narrow sense of Justice, which mistake may impose upon him, and lays claim to the latitude of Justice, as that which is in, and teaches men, from the Law, the practice of it. And this the better to obtain, he premises, that Ju|stice, as it is in <HI>fonte,</HI> and essentially in God, is like God himself inscrutable, having the vail of inaccessible glory before it, and dazling mortal eyes to an inperception of it; which yet, through the mediation of the Laws composed by wise men, and worded apt|ly to ordinary capacity, is in such a measure revealed, as it may be learned in some com|petent measure by them. And this adds much to the renown of the Law, that it dis|covers so excellent a Jewel, as harmonizes the World, and keeps it in any tolerable Concord; which because Justice does, 'twill be pertinent here to write somewhat addi|tional, to what is before delivered of her.</P>
<P>Justice, either is considerable alone, as one of the Virtues, or as <HI>complex,</HI> and inclu|ding all virtues in her. In the first sense, my Text-Master intends her not here; nor shall I in that here inlarge on it: but as she is the Lesson, that the Law learns both Prince and People; so she is to be acknowledged summarily all virtue. The Schools define Justice to be <HI>rectitudo impressa voluntati &agrave; rectitudine rationis quae dicitur veritas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sanctus</HI> Thom. <HI>prima secunda,</HI> 960. <HI>art.</HI> 3.

This shall suffice, for what our Chancellour, out of <HI>Leonardus Are|tinus, Homer,</HI> and <HI>Aristotle</HI> quotes, to the phrase of Justice, as it is the Parent of all other Virtue; and particularly the Prerogative, and Royal Embelishment of Kings: For so it follows.</P>
<Q><P>Iustitia vero haec, subjectum est omnis regalis curae, quo sinc illa Rex just&egrave; non judicat, nec rect&egrave; pugnare potest.</P></Q>
<P>In this sentence, our Master applyes Justice to the King, as the Rudder that must move and actuate him that is the Mover and Spirit of all his Government: For in Go|vernment, the King and the Law, though two in number, yet are but one in nature, both making but one Head; which Head, our Authour says, ought to be filled with no Proclamations but Justice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eurypid. <HI>in</HI> Ale|maeo, <HI>in</HI> Stobaeus, <HI>p.</HI> 148, 504.</NOTE> and the care of it. Care did I say, yes to purpose; Princes find it so, that rule well and justly, <GAP DESC="foreign">: Oh! the tortures and troubles of Crowns! what anxious thoughts, what discomposed plea|sures, what Earth-quakes of popular murmure and insolence, does greatness totter upon? <HI>Antigonus</HI> had so much of it, that on a day, when a poor Woman admired him for his Diadem and Purple Robe; he cryed out to her, <HI>O Mother, if thou knewest the guilt and trouble of th&eacute;se,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Stobaeus, <HI>Serm.</HI> 148.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp;c. that is, <HI>thou would'st not take it up from the ground, if there it lay, and thou mayst have it for taking up, the charge attends it.</HI> In|deed, did people know how real deservers Princes are of their duties, what laborious Bees they are to bring them the honey of peace; what Clouds of plenty they are, and all to disgorge their Tributes and Customs in protection and orderly government of them, they would make more Conscience of duty to them then now they do. <HI>Est enim ea hominum conditio,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Corda <HI>in vita</HI> Virgilii.</NOTE> <HI>ut si quando justum Regem nacti sunt velint potius illi subdi quam esse liberi, etiamsi Rex hic sit Tyrannus, quare Dominarite &amp; tibi Orbi conducit,</HI> was <HI>Virgil</HI>'s counsel to <HI>Augustus,</HI> wen he was in a quandary, whether to hold, or resign the Empire.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In</HI> Panegyr.</NOTE> For what <HI>Pliny</HI> said to one is here true, <HI>Parens tibi imperium dedit, tuilli reddidisti, ultro dantem obligasti, communicato enim imperio solicitior tu, ille securior fa|ctus est.</HI> People have more from Princes, in care and vigilance, for, and over them, then Princes have from people, in tributes and perquisites of their Crown, which they carefully wear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dion.

What then they do besides the Rule, and beyond Justice, lyes on them to answer to God; for their
<PB N="65" REF="44">
square and tether is Justice thats the onely subject matter that Regality should express care in; and that done, security will flow in upon King and Kingdom. For to promote this there is a kinde of necessity in a Prince to take this glorious Mancipation on him. And did not God kindle ambitions of glory, by publick beneficencies in great mindes, they would never deny themselves the delights of private living, to take the envy and murmure of Government and Rule upon them; for when Subjects sleep, Princes wake; when they eat and drink to freedom, Princes are to keep cool heads, that they may be ripe and ready in counsel and action; when they love and marry whom they please, Princes are, and must be bound up by Reason of State, and marry to their best Interest, and strongest Allyance; when they command hours for private devotions, and hug their pillows as their ease, casting off care with their cloaths; Princes are masters of no privacies; hurried they are up and down in the day, and perplexed in the night with myriads of thoughts, tumultuating one upon another; every shadow presents su|spition and fear to them. And they knowing not what a moment may bring forth, are in no moment hereby quiet: when they see a Subject popular and wise, they fear his discontent, disaffection, and the fruits of it Rebellion: When they hear of Multi|tudes querulous, and parties among the people, their prudence aims to head none of them; but to ballance them both, so that neither may have the advantage of other, but the Law regulate both. When they observe Princes their Neighbours, in warlike paradoe, they must arm too, that the noise of their vigilance and preparation, may pre|vent what is malevolently designed from abroad against them. And when their own Subjects are in Arms, they take care, lest they should not be distributed into their first particles without inconvenience. When they are to court Forreign Favourites, they are dubious to trust, where they have not tryed, and found fidelity; and when their way is made, then their care is to improve by subtilty, what prudently they have gained. For not to proceed wisely in what is begun, is to retrograde in publique reputation; and to proceed faster then the good speed of Affairs dictates, is to be less advised then Princes ought to be. When Affairs are on foot, they must be sup|plyed with Instructions, money and all other necessaries; and when they are brought to their growth and birth, then the case is, how to produce them gallantly, and to be moderate under the interpretation of them with men, whose bolts will be diversly shot, and censures boldly delivered upon them. These, and myriads of such like emer|gencies, discompose the lives and peaces of Princes, and great men, and deny them the serenato's and calms that privacy delights their possessours with. When <HI>Bajazet</HI> the Fourth had lost his Son <HI>Orthobulus,</HI> and his City <HI>Sebastia,</HI> he could sing no Notes so cherrily as the shepherd, whom he sighingly cryed out happy, because he had none of them to lose.</P>
<P>Yet these cares are all but in order to the highest care of Kings; Justice, which be|ing the project of God, in the government of the World, calls them as dutiful Chil|dren, wise servants, and worthy Patrons of Popularities, to imitate him the Father, Ma|ster, and Defender of his Creation, and the Polities in it, which they can no ways to the life do, but by Justice.</P>

<P>This is added, to shew the necessity of the presence of Justice in every act of Rega|lity, Peace and War are the two hands of Government; and both these are to be bound and loosed by Justice.

For God having intrusted power with Princes, to felicifie, and not ruine their people by it, prescribes Justice, as the me|thod of its dispensation to this end;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alciat. <HI>ad leg.</HI> 15. <HI>Lib.</HI> De Verbor. signific <HI>p.</HI> 43.</NOTE> and the Laws of God and men stating Justice in every application to them, conducts Princes to their Prerogative, and instructs people in their Allegiance readily and religiously; so that the Law being <HI>ars aequi &amp; boni,</HI> and justice the end of it, being that which Prince and people are made happy by, there is reason that the Law, in assertion of Justice, should be adhered to.</P>

<P>This is the recollection of the premises to produce the conclusion, which our Text|Master makes in justification of the Law, and of the excellency of Justice taught by it. For since the end of all active virtue is felicity, &amp; that is acquired by nothing more then Justice; and that Justice is specificated by the Law, which is the Rule and Model of it, and which onely can teach it perfectly, and make the knowledge of it productive of those fruits, which are comportable with Justice, in all the latitude of her relation to God, men, and a mans self, it reasonably follows, that not onely the Law is excellent, as it is repleat with Wisdom, and answers the ends of Gubernative Policy; but as it implants in, and exercises the mind that is furnished from it, with that perfect notion of felicity by vir|tue; which because it is a complex of all attainable goodness, and furnishes a man to every good word and work, is here called Justice; for so are the next words.</P>
<Q><P>Sequitur qu&ograve;d Iustitia fruens faelix per legem est, &amp; per eam ipse sit beatus, cum idem sit beatitudo, &amp; faelicitas in hac fugaci vita.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Iustitia fruens faelix per legem est.</HI> The phrase <HI>fruens</HI> referring to the Will, <HI>Quia frui est in voluntate,</HI> helps much to the comprehension of the Chancellour's meaning, That the felicity which man attains by the knowledge of the Law, ariseth from the de|light of the subject, in which it is to Justice; when in the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI>'s words, <HI>I de|light in thy Law in my inward parts</HI>; or as the Prophet <HI>David</HI> said, <HI>I had hid thy Law in my heart, that I should not sin against thee.</HI> In this case, the Soul that is every way quadrate,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign"> Stobaeus, <HI>Serm.</HI> 1. <HI>p.</HI> 2.</NOTE> and that looks to all God's Commandements with an indifferent and just eye, not daring to dispense with any part of his duty, may well be pronounced happy by the Verdict of Law. For God has given it that just confidence, that it shall stand in Judg|ment, that it shall not fear evil tydings, since its principle, which is fixed on the Rule, leads to Beatitude, and to what is the Porch of it, humble confidence. And indeed,
<PB N="67" REF="45">
what can make a man happy, but that Justice of principle and practice, which the Law justifies?<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Injuria semper in|justa est. Laedi etiam aliques ju|st&egrave; potest. Nam &amp; qui jure damnan|tur, laduntur, sed non injuri&acirc;.</HI> Asco|nius Praedianus, <HI>apud</HI> Philoxe|num. <HI>Lib.</HI> De Serm. Latino, <HI>p.</HI> 747.</NOTE> And what of this nature does the Law allow as a virtue, worthy its encou|ragement, but that which is tending to Justice: There is a mutual reciprocating of Ec|cho's, 'twixt Law, Happiness, and Justice; they answer each other, as parts of that Line of Communication which connects <HI>Heaven and Earth</HI> together: For when all things are at a stun, when Beauty gives way to putrefaction, Riches, Honours, and Wisdom weep out their woful farewel, <HI>Righteousness delivereth from death</HI>; not from death, as a debt to Nature, for it is appointed for all men once to dye: but from death, as a terrour; from the despair of comfort in, and mercy after death. This it delivereth from, thus in <HI>Hezekiah</HI>'s cafe, That <HI>Remember, O Lord, I have walked before thee with an upright heart,</HI> was his Cordial against the cutting off of his days; it being the course of God, to give unto all men somewhat of comfort, or terrour in their departure, suitable to the merit, or demerit of their lives.</P>
<P>But, I trow, there is another sense more genuine of this <HI>Iustitia fruens faelix per le|gemest</HI>; which is this, he that has the benefit of Justice, is by the Law happy; for that the Magistrate, which is the <HI>living Law,</HI> is appointed by God to speak, and do comfortably to those that live under his charge, and are inoffensive to his power. And truly, it is no mean degree of happiness, which the Justice of Magistrates conveys to those under their charge, if the particulars of it be duly weighed; <HI>To live peaceable lives in all godlyness and honesty, to sit under our own Vine and Fig-tree, and to possess ones good things in peace; to drink of the water of our own Fountain, and to have the credit and comfort of God's blessing on our propagation; to keep our fleece on our backs, and not to have them shaven, and our lives taken from us, to colour the injury. To have the know|ledge of God run down in the Land like a mighty stream,</HI> is happiness, carrying its witness with it. <HI>And blessed are the people that are in such a case</HI>; and with this outward ad|vantage, <HI>have the Lord for their God. But all this is from that Iustice, which the Law, by the Magistrate,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quod sol mundo est &amp; sanitas cor|pori, hoc animo &amp; Reipubl. est Iu|stitia.

And therefore the Chancellour had a good reach when he said, <HI>Iustitia fruens faelix per legem est</HI>; for as he told the governed their happiness, so the Governour his duty, which is to love justice in himself, that he may administer it to his Subjects. For it is a sin not to be just, and a greater in the Prince, then in the People, because of the eminency of the one above the other. And that Prince that is unjust, and yet will be owned as <HI>Custos utri&uacute;sque tabuls,</HI> had need seize his Subjects reason as an Escheat, and make a Law, that people should believe no|thing good or bad, but as it is published to be by him; for if men be left to the just la|titude of their Reason, they will conclude him no worthy Prince that is not just. Where|fore the happiness that people enjoy under just Princes, is not onely from their good will, free concession, and gracious indulgence, but from a benefit also drilling down from Princes by the Laws of Nations, on People, as the Vallies which they water, <HI>and therefore Laws are accounted publique Treasuries, that buy out common slavery into En|franchisement.</HI> And therefore the Law is called by the <HI>Greeks</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, some say <GAP DESC="foreign">, which signifies, to distribute; as telling us, that whatever happiness subjection has, is from the justice of Kings by their Laws. <HI>Eurypides</HI> says there are but three virtues which he would have his Child learn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stobaeus, <HI>Serm.</HI> 1. <HI>p.</HI> 1.</NOTE> <HI>To fear the Gods, to honour our Parents, and to reverence <GAP DESC="foreign"> <GAP DESC="foreign">, the common Laws of</HI> Greece; as conceiving the reverence of the Law to be next duty to God, and our Parents: and whatever assurance Government has, is from the same sourse; for the Law of Natural Justice teaches, that protection is to be recompenced with subjection, and subjection to be maintained by protection; both which are best kept up by Justice; which Justice makes man happy according to Law.</P>

<L>Quo &amp; per cam ipse fit beatus, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
<P>Well added, for no man can be sure of a good end from an ill beginning, <HI>non habet eventus sordida praeda bonos</HI>; the just God has joyned together Justice, which is in effect, all virtue, to happiness, that men may know the way to the one by the other. For men must pay toll at the Castle of Justice, before they come to the Basileopolis of Hap|piness. And since Pairs are so beautiful in their conjunction, the Chancellour has by an elegant Synonyma identified <HI>beatitudo &amp; faelicitas,</HI> at least <HI>in has fugaci vita,</HI> in the con|dition whereof, we men are onely meet apprehenders of them. For he supposes, that the upshot of all man's motion in his calling and sphere, is but to attain rest; and that rest, from the toil of life, he fixeth in his Chair of State old Age, under the Canopy of his Night-Cap, and in the Robe of his Gown, having in his hand the scepter of his staff, and his Cough as the Herald, making room for him to the grave. Now that obtain|ed, he accounts himself happy to live in credit, dye in peace, leave a good name to survive him; that's all that the beatitude and felicity of this life amounts to, and this is only attainable by Justice. <HI>The just,</HI> saith the Wise-man, <HI>shall he had in everlasting remem|brance</HI>; and in another place, <HI>the memory of the dead shall be blessed.</HI> And this bles|sedness shall the Law pronounce, when it testifies, that we have lived to the true and just purposes of life.

<Q><L>Cujus &amp; per justitiam ipse summum habet bonum.</L></Q>
<P>The Chancellour, as one in love with Justice, makes the <HI>summum bonum</HI> of life to consist in it; and so it must, considering he asserts it beatitude and felicity, which is the <HI>summum bonum</HI> of any thing; for what is the beatitude of a thing more then the per|fection, and what is the perfection less then the felicity of it: so that there being as per|fect a concord in the Chancellour's words,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In</HI> Pandect. <HI>fo.</HI> 58.

<Q><L>Tamen non nisi per gratiam lex poterit ista operari.</L></Q>
<P>Herein, as in other places, the Chancellour, like a devout man, and a knowing Christian, recalls his former extolling of the Law (as the Rule of Justice bestowing upon man the felicity of this life) by interpreting himself, as ascribing the main work

to Grace, and to God the giver of it. For though that be true of Laws, which <HI>Plato</HI> desires of men, <GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp;c. <HI>When God intends well to any man, or place, he raises up, and increases good men in it,</HI> which <HI>Morellus</HI> says, has been verified in <HI>France,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Praefatione in lib.</HI> Senec.

For though I well know the Law is just, holy, and good, and all Laws have the most presumptions of success, in what they undertake to teach, and seldom do lead into any thing beneath the most exact habit and action of virtue; yet in that they do this in conjunction with, not abstracted from divine grace, I think it just to ascribe all the perfection in virtue that man attains to by the Law, to God's blessing which derives energy to it. Indeed the Law can, as a System, and collection of divine truths, and prudent Rules, method us in justice, and teach us to use virtues,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Durand.

This is solely an act of grace from God, whose Prerogative it is to do, and not to do, as he pleases; and therefore without God, man's free will is nothing; no|thing without God's co-operation.

And therefore our Chancellour has written no more here of grace, then the Schools generally assert. And <HI>Brulifer,</HI> though he would allow as much to man's will, and Piety's merit, as may be presumptuously arrogated, yet brings in a four-fold grace of God indulged man, suit|able to the four-fold evil he is immersed in: The evils are, 1. <HI>Combat with Satan's temptation.</HI> 2. <HI>The wrath of God.</HI> 3. <HI>The guilt of sin.</HI> 4. <HI>The sequel of sin.</HI> The grace that God vouchsafes, are, <HI>Protection, Deliverance, Extraction, Salvation.</HI> So that the triumph of a sinner over his toil and impossibilities, is from this grace of God, which enables him to every good word and work. This grace is therefore as the gift of God to, so the work of God in us; 'tis that which excites us to, retains us in, and rewards us for well-doing; because it is a largess of God to us expressive of eudochy, and complacentialness; it's that which God answers men by: if not <HI>secundum identita|tem desideriorum,</HI> yet <HI>secundum aequivalentiam</HI>: if not just as they desire, yet in the best exposition of their desire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. Mirandul. <HI>in</HI> Hexap. <HI>c.</HI> 5. <HI>p.</HI> 30.</NOTE> that is, in such good as he sees best for them. No won|der then that <HI>Heathens,</HI> in all great undertakings, addressed to their Gods, praying their aid and influence, since they found themselves impotent to reach any things of remoteness without them. For God himself has declared it his Prerogative, <HI>to bless, and curse; to raise up, and pull down.</HI> And the Law can do nothing, either to con|vince of sin, or conduct to virtue, but as God's fescue in Magistrates hand. 'Tis God above, that must open the eye of the understanding, and incline the heart to good; yea, and 'tis God's grace onely, that when the good and excellent path of life is discovered, puts man in,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dist. 26. <HI>q.</HI> 1. <HI>lib.</HI> 2. <HI>p.</HI> 395</NOTE> and keeps him on from halting or deviation; not onely by an act <HI>informa|tionis &amp; denominationis subjecti,</HI> presenting good to us, <HI>sed redditionis operis meritorii</HI>; as <HI>Durand</HI> too durely phrases it, that is, rendring it accepted in the beloved <HI>Lord Iesus.</HI></P>
<P>The consideration of which brings in grace in Scripture, under so many honourable, and useful attributes, that it's hard to think of benefits, whereof our nature and con|dition is capable, which this grace and favour of God does not accommodate us with; it restrains from sin, it excites to duty, it conflicts with despair, it actuates faith, it erects fortitude, it debases pride, it adorns humility, it promotes self-denial, it is victoriously

valiant against the enemies of the soul; yea, it keeps the heart equanimous, neither presumptuous, nor despondent, but equilibrious, as a Son should be, between the fear of duty and mercenariness.

For, as in the body, the prepotency of malignant humours, impedes the opera|tion of the noblest Potions; so in the soul, till grace have obtained the mastery over the brutal and lower Regents, there is no effects of grace probable to appear. It must be God that first excites, then by a concomitation crowns our endeavours with a desi|red issue. He gives recompence to diligence by wealth; to patience by victory; to humility by exaltation; to penitence by pardon. All that art and industry can do (ab|stracted from this grace as its benediction, which includes it's <HI>fiat</HI>) is nothing. <HI>Lewis</HI> the Ninth of <HI>France</HI> was a wise and pious Prince, yet he made but two Voyages against Infidels; one into <HI>Egypt,</HI> and the other into <HI>Barbary,</HI> and miscarried in both. In the first, he himself was taken prisoner, and his whole Army overthrown. In the latter, he dyed of the Plague. <HI>Caesar Borgia</HI> fearing that his Father Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> the sixth dying, the Papacy would come into the hands of his Enemy, ordered affairs so dexter|ously as he thought, that which way soever they steered, he should be out of danger: Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> shortly after dyed; and <HI>Caesar Borgia</HI> fell so sick, that he could exe|cute nothing he had designed; and so the Popedom came nnto his professed Enemy: so that the Chancellour's Position is most true, <HI>Non nisi per gratiam lex poterit ista operarii.</HI></P>
<Q><P>Neque legem aut virtutem sine gratia tu addiscere poteris, vel appetere, c&ugrave;m &ugrave;t dicit Parisiensis (in libro suo <HI>cur Deus homo</HI>) virtus hominis appetitiva interior per pec|catum originale it &agrave; vitiata est, ut sibi vitiorum suavia, &amp; virtutum aspera opera sapiant.</P></Q>
<P>This is added, to shew how impotent the best Prescripts of Nature are to any excel|lent and certain end, in their abstraction from God's grace: neither the whole duty of man, which our Chancellour means by the Law, in which 'tis proposed; nor any part of it contained in single virtues, can be either desired, or practised by us, but with assistance of God's grace. First, we cannot, <HI>appetere legem aut virtutem,</HI> without grace; for <HI>appetuntur quae secundum naturam sunt,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 3. De Natur. deorum.</NOTE> deelinantur contraria,</HI> is <HI>Tully</HI>'s rule. Now the nature of man is so averse to virtue, as subverted from its created rectitude, that it op|poses it self to it, and declines it so, that if it be brought upon the love and practice of it, it must be by a divine perswasion, and sweet compulsion, from grace moving the Will to follow an enlightened understanding, and engaged affections. And then secondly, man cannot <HI>addiscere,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Offic. 21.</NOTE> that is, not onely learn, as Oratours sometimes use the word, but <HI>quasi aliquid addere adea quae didiceris,</HI> as our Text intends. No man can add to what na|ture instructs him in, concerning virtues divine and moral, but by grace; for thereby onely corruption is discovered, and the means of recuperation and restitution, by im|provement, revealed. Neither of these so necessary to our compleatness, are attainable, but by the grace of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Non dat natura virtutem, ars est bonum sieri. De|erat illis justitia, deerat prudentia, deerat temperan|tiae ac fortitudo, omnibus his virtu|tibus babebat si|miliae quaedam rudis vita, virtus non contingit ani|mo nisi instituto &amp; edocto, &amp; ad sum|mum assidu&agrave; ex|ercitatione perda|cto</HI> Senec. <HI>Ep.</HI> 90.</NOTE> which brings the light and truth of God's discovery to the Conscience, in compunction and contrition; and then carryes the convinced subject to <HI>Iesus,</HI> the anchor, the price, the pattern, the donour of integrity, from which corrupted nature is the lapse. Indeed, in <HI>Heathens,</HI> and pure moral men, there may be suddain options, and passionate transports, reflected from the terrours of natural Conscience, which may cajole a man to ingenuous confessions, and seemingly serious protestations of amendment. But these being the products of no solid and sincere conviction, but the fruits of God's terrour, which he often injects into, and sometimes long continues upon wicked men, are but <HI>splendida peccata,</HI> no acts of grace, but of power: which as a Crea|tour, not a Father, God expresses himself to his Creature in. By these he over-wrought <HI>Balaam</HI> to bless, whom he resolved to curse, and <HI>Abimelech,</HI> not to take <HI>Sarah,</HI> whom he resolved to prostitute; which had they not been, neither the good words of the one,

So that whatever these, and other <HI>Heathens</HI> did, in order to self-mastery, magnanimity, contentation, patience, justice, charity, though they are effects of general grace, that is, of the largess of God the Creatour, to man his creature, yet are they but imperfect works, because they did them as lures to their own same, and as defensatives of them|selves from miscarrying in the deluge of censure and defamation, which hurries down into the lake of dishonour all sordid, illiberal, debauched courses; and hence they deserve to be accounted not so properly virtues, as the umbra's of them: because, beyond the Elysium of fame, there is no reward for these; for so, according to their calculation, is their reward in this World: for all they aimed at, was to appear to men; God, the principle of their activity, was superiour to, though not at all in their intendment and purpose;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bradward; De Causa Dei, <HI>lib.</HI> 20 <HI>c.</HI> 5. <HI>p.</HI> 287.</NOTE> and subjected they were, to what they could not oppose. <HI>Bona ipsa opera quae faciunt infideles, non ipsorum esse, sed illius qui ben&egrave; utitur malis,</HI> said that renowned Father of our Church against the <HI>Pelagians.</HI> And therefore there is vast difference be|tween the Works of Grace and Nature, of <HI>Heathens</HI> and <HI>Christians</HI>; because, though in the externity, and materials of them, they may have an equipollency; yet in the in|tention, rule,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beda, <HI>cap.</HI> 13. <HI>contra</HI> Julianum.</NOTE> principle, and purpose, (which bears away the reputation with God) there is no agreement.

<P>This is a good inference from the premised assertion; since all mans chief good, by Philo|sophy is made to consist in felicity or beatitude, this felicity or beatitude is attainable by Justice; this Justice taught and learned by the Law, the Law made effectual by Gods grace accompanying it. Hence argues the <HI>Chancellor</HI>; if such be the attainments by the Laws, then the Laws of God, Nature, Nations, are to be chiefly learned by a Prince, Indeed the Ar|gument has as much of <HI>cogency,</HI> as <HI>utile</HI> and <HI>decorum</HI> can give it; and while there is a tye of grace upon the Laws, without which they are counted ineffectual, there is no fear, supererogation, or attribution of ought to them in derogation to grace, which is the gift of God by them; as it is not bread that supports life, nor air that cools and re|freshes the inwards, nor light that promotes order, nor physick that procures health, but God's <HI>fiat</HI> and creative permission and benediction, whereby not onely their innate and specifique virtue, in a beneficent exertion, accommodates it self to, but is conducted and confirmed by the omnipotence of God so to do: so is it not the Law that can bring the mind by understanding the definition, to affect the direction, and execution of justice, except God incline, and circumact the heart to the comple|tion of it; and that by a grace of prevention, taking out of our way those rubs that im|ply avocation, making us of unwilling willing; and then by carrying on those begin|nings to procedure, by breaking out the crepusculum into the bright day, <HI>n&egrave; frustra velimus,</HI> that is, by assisting us <HI>to run the race with patience that is set before us, looking unto Iesus.</HI> O 'tis a rare Prospect of the Crucifix, that brings us to make our selves vild, and of no reputation, that we may be obtainers of preventing grace, and do the will of God, by aid of his co-operating grace. Our <HI>Lord Iesus</HI> gave us the presi|dent to follow him, that we might be enjoyers of happiness with him, <HI>Gratias agamus domino &amp; salvatori nostro, qui nos nullis praecedentibus meritis vulneratos curavit, &amp; ini|micos reconciliavit, &amp; de captivitate redemit, de tenebris ad lucem reduxit, de morte ad vitam revocavit, &amp; hxmiliter confitentes fragilitatem nostram illius misericordiam depre|cemur, &ugrave;t quia nos misericordia sua praevertit,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 1 Homil.

<P>Without grace then, the Law is ineffectual to bring Princes by Justice to beatitude, since it will not inform them of the excellency of virtue, nor subdue them to its method by efficacy of conviction, which makes practique virtue, and carries to, and ends in beatitude, but by help from above. Moral swasions are weak Physick, to carry away peccant humours prepossessing: it must be grace from God that vehiculates them to the parts disaffected, and by them works evacuation and restitution to a better habit. If our righteousnesses, that are as filthy rags, become clean garments before God: if our Salt that has lost its savour, be savoured by his acceptance; if our darkness become light in the Lord, through the Lord of Lights irradiation on us; if our covetousness of the Earthly Mammon be converted into the earnest covering of the best things; if instead of crying out against our selves, when we have done all we can, <HI>that we are unprofitable servants,</HI> as our Lord commands us. It must be the work of grace.</P>

This, this, is the soul, rule, guide to the Laws, wherein Justice, as the way to beatitude, is deposited. And without this grace of God, the Worlds Philosopy, the Laws learning, nay, Justice to the highest proportion imaginable for man to arrive at, will be but Ap|ples of <HI>Sodom,</HI> beauteous in appearance, but rottenness aud nullity in the proof of it: so true is that of the Wise-man, even in this riches, as well as in any other; <HI>The blessing of the Lord maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow thereto.</HI></P>
<P>And therefore no wonder, though our Chancellour says, <HI>toto conamine addiscendae sunt leges,</HI> when he joyns the grace of God with the Law, and makes the Law sacred by its conjunction with, or rather subserviency to God's grace. For this premised, nothing can be imagined more pleasing and profitable to the Reason and Religion of a Prince, then the Laws, because they lead to the chief good by the best aids; to God, by God. This is no other then Scripture Divinity, God the chief good apprehended by Faith in the eye, Hope in the heart, Charity in the hand, Humility in the knee, per|severance in the foot, which are all but other wordings of grace, preventing and ac|companying. Since to attain these, as there is no means but that of God's grace in chief, and our obsequiousness to it, as the consequent of it: so are those to be fol|lowed to this heavenly purpose <HI>toto conamine,</HI> no saint, remiss, refracted, minute de|sires, will do to purpose this deed. This Heaven on Earth is for the violent and labori|ous Bees, that let no endeavour pass untryed to attain it, refuse no hazard or toil to conquer and atchieve it. He that wrastles with God in prayer night and day, he it is that <HI>toto conamine,</HI> endeavour knowledge of the Laws: For <HI>Conamen</HI> here signi|fies not so much the act, as the endeavour and desire to it, which expresses it self in a fixation and unmovableness of intention upon it, when all the man sets to it (<HI>conari ma|nibus, pedibus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Andr. 5. 4. <HI>Pro Quinto</HI> 27. <HI>Pro Scylla</HI> 56.</NOTE> as <HI>Terence</HI> says,) 'tis such an expression as <HI>Cicero</HI> meant, when he uses <HI>magno conatu studioque agere,</HI> to set out industry, or a <HI>conatus cum impetu,</HI> such an one, as Beast and Bruits express, when they are carryed to or fro from things they love or hate; <HI>To do what we do with all our might,</HI> as <HI>Solomon</HI>'s words are: This is <HI>toto conamine addiscere</HI>; nor can it well be otherwise, for it is in order to the greatest and utmost good, to Justice, the delight of God, and perfection of a Prince: yet this, though insisted on with all imaginable strenuity, will not be effected but by grace; and that present and concurring, nothing can be wanting; That God has declared the true <HI>Elixar</HI> that makes what ever it touches partaker of its virtue, and transforms it from what it was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theatrum Chy|micum. <HI>p.</HI> 481.</NOTE> to what is more excellent; not by Sir <HI>Edward Kellets</HI> mystical jugling (no better then commerce with <HI>Satan</HI>) whereby brass is transformed to silver, and copper-wyre into gold, as some Chymists report him to have done.

<P>And this I conceive our Text-Master found experimentally in himself, God had made him a Martyr for Loyalty, a Champion for the Laws, whom because they could not bend, (who would have their wills the Law, and not make the Law their Wills) they resolve to banish, and break in mind, fortune, body; and he, though he had undoubt|edly many friends of <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth's party, who would, and could have made his peace, and procured his freedom to live at home, yet he rather chose to live free abroad, then a slave in a free Countrey, and under a free Law, as <HI>England</HI> ought to have been, but was not. Hereupon his leisure, and loss of practice by business at home, proves his opportunity to study God, affliction, men, his own heart, more and more throughly.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 119.</NOTE> And now he cryes out, <HI>If it had not been for God's Law his delight, he had perished in his affliction.</HI> Now he owns gratefully to God, <HI>that it was good for him to be afflicted.</HI> Now the fruits and comforts of Justice in his profession, place, practice, quondamly return on him the reward of their integrity: Sure he that writes so divinely of Justice, &amp; presses the Law as the Rule of Princes in it, found the Justice of Laws great subterfuges to his disconsolacy, and retreats to his once mistakes of God's dealings. The greatest discoveries men have of God's light and truth, are from the midst of Lightnings and Thunders, Afflictions Storms end in a calm of merciful sublevation; when the bush burns, and is not consumed, <HI>Isaac</HI>'s throat is under the knife, then the Ram caught by the horns is welcome to <HI>Abraham,</HI> as God's provision for a sacrifice of redemption. So often as I think of <HI>Patmos,</HI> the place of Saint <HI>Iohn's Revelation</HI> of, and prospect into the mysteries of glory, of which the fuller sight is reserved for hereafter, I cannot but conclude our Chancellour, was made what he so divinely by his being driven from house and home; for now he being taken off from the troubles of visits, and distractions of business, which storm-like, come in crouds, and cross waves of different import, has thereby leisure to converse with God, and to commune with his own heart; and being removed from the impulsion of this World's Hell, which by force and fraud either ter|rifie or allure men into snares. The judgment that he (in this condition of separation being more impartial) gives, carryes the stronger reason, and will be more influen|tial, by how much the more sincere it is presumed to be, since nothing so embases coun|sel and instruction, as the prae-occupation of interest, to the proportion and scope of which it is often experimented mercenary:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Leges Magistra|tus &amp; judicia quaedam quasi sunt numina divi|nit&ugrave;s constituta in Republ</HI> Hop|perus, <HI>lib. unico,</HI> De justitia Prin|cipis.</NOTE> which being not to be suspected in our Chancellour, renders his words not onely swasive but in a sort imperative, as they flow from the almost infallible Oracle and Fountain of great Learning, grave Experience, entire Affection, and noble Loyalty.</P>
<Q><P>Ver&egrave; etsi non haec te moveant qui regnum recturus es, movebunt te, &amp; arctabunt ad di|sciplinatum legis Prophetae verba, dicentis, erudimini, qui judicatis terram.</P></Q>
<P>Still our Text-Master proceeds to inculcate on the Prince a valuation of the Law, which, though he had by many pregnant Arguments, commended to him, he yet fur|ther urges from a higher Authority then that of Philosophers, and men of age and wis|dom: For though it were enough to youth, that antiquity found in the way of righ|teousness, commended this or that to them, because multitude of years teach wisdom, and the Spirit of God in that counsel or command, <HI>Thou shalt rise up before the Hoar-headed,</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="49">
gives youth to know his acceptation of respect shewed to them, then which, greater cannot be testified then to be directed and instructed by them: yet the Chan|cellour brings in the irrefragable advice of God's Spirit, by the Kingly Prophet, in the person of Christ Jesus, who being the Prince of peace, as well as power, allures all his Delegates, to submit themselves to his Scepter willingly, throughly, constantly, and to be lessoned, that thus to do, is to advance their power, and attone the displea|sure, that obstinacy may treasure up against them: <HI>Be instructed</HI> (saith he) <HI>ye Iudges of the Earth.</HI> Now this he brings in out of the second <HI>Psalm,</HI> not primarily, (for then he might have been thought to distrust the efficacy of his pre-engagements of the Prin ces reason, since Justice lodged in, and learned from the Law, is of concern enough to move a man, a Prince, in order to a King, to value, and endeavour to understand the notion and practice of it, as the <HI>sine qu&acirc; non,</HI> to his very essence and being <HI>qu&acirc;</HI> such.) But the cause that this Scripture is superinduced, is rhetorically to overbear the Prince, that all excuse laid aside, he should as a man, and as a King, incessantly apply himself to holy instruction in the will of God, revealed in his Law moral, and in the extracts from it, the National Laws fitted to his Government. For though true it be, that per|haps when our Chancellour wrote to the Prince, <HI>Henry</HI> the Sixth was alive; or if dead, the Prince was not actually King, as in Title and Truth after his Father the Chancel|lour conceived he ought to have been: yet the good Chancellour bespeaks him, to pre|pare before against the time of tryal, to imitate <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Pismire, that laid up in the Winter of ruines store, against the Summer of rule, provokes him by all the engage|ments of Providence and probability, to antedate his Regality, and become a King in Learning and Endowment, before he becomes King in fact and acknowledgment. And this he does not, by kindling in him thoughts of revenge, and flames of abhorrence to those persons and practices, that raised War against his Father, and forced him abroad; yea, threatned his never return, but by courting him to learn of God, how to want, and how to abound; how to be without subject or subsistance, and how to use both moderately, and to the ends of God's glory, and Governours institution: which wisely, and well to learn, he directs him to attend the counsel of holy <HI>David,</HI> a King and a Prophet, <HI>Ex utroque Caesar,</HI> a man of valour, and a Prince of piety, to be instructed, and that because he is to judge others: and thereupon that he may not ei|ther not do what, or do otherwise then what he ought to do to men, as one of the Judges of the Earth, to be well grounded in knowledge, the rule of action. Now, though I know it becomes not any Subject to treat of the duties of Princes but with reverence, which many men have forgot in their late Treatises concerning them: yet shall I be hold to touch upon this subject here, as my method leads me, in the Exposi|tion of this Scripture, though that but shortly, modestly, and I hope with submissive wisdom above offence. The quotation then out of <HI>Psal.</HI> ii. 3. <HI>Erudimini qui judica|tis terram,</HI> though it was largely intended to all, to whom instruction is proper; yet presly and primarily was directed to the great men of the World, whom the Prophet foresaw to be industriously composed, and pertinaciously resolved, against the recepti|on of Christ in his Gospel, Government, and Doctrine. And this I suppose the <HI>Psal|mist</HI> had revealed to him particularly from God, whose prescience and omniscience dis|covered it to be such in the Revolutions of time, and productions of men, that both the prenunciation of it might accord with other Prophecies in the testimony and truth of mens opposition to the Son of God; and that as the godly might be prepared not to stumble at it, so the wicked might be left without excuse, when their pertinacy suf|fers the just indignation of God's Son against them.</P>
<P>Which premised, the words have respect to somewhat implyed, and somewhat ex|pressed: The implication is, that great men, Judges of the Earth, need instruction: not onely as they are men in common with others, subjected to the consequences of sin, which have labefacted all the Integrals of created Faculties, and made us dark in our Intellects, averse in our Wills, dull in our affections to good; yea, in a sort estranged us from the love of duty to, and subjection under God, but as they are persons pecu|liarly elevated above others, apt to be flattered by, and inflamed from the vain delusions of their Parasites, that they are made believe (unless God give them more humility to know themselves) the best and happyest of men, when (God knows) their Cedar heighth, lyes in the storm and heat of all temptations; and having such snares about them, better

But the <HI>Erudimini</HI> here is, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>'tis to follow and imitate nature; embrace plain and naked truth, <GAP DESC="foreign">, to see good Laws and right Constitutions obeyed in all parts of Government,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> De Temu|lentia, <HI>p</HI> 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">5 <HI>p.</HI> 261.</NOTE> as <HI>Philo</HI>'s words are; and this to do, as to do it, is that <HI>which is insculpt on the Table of man's heart, to obey God, who has fixed Governours to rule for him, and will have account of their trusts from them.</HI> So is it <HI>to be followers of God as dear children,</HI> in all those imitable acts, which as a Father, and King of order, he proposes to them in his example. The prophetique King here takes great men to task as their Monitor, and he bids them, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>castigate vos,</HI> he bids them understand, that whereas God has given them exemption from mens casti|gation, yet he requires they should restrain and curb themselves; for the root, <GAP DESC="foreign">, signifies such a restriction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pagninus <HI>in</HI> Verbo.</NOTE> as men in bonds and setters have, <HI>n&egrave; pro sua libidine evage|tur &amp; vivaet</HI>: 'tis not barely to know; for that the Holy Ghost have expressed by <GAP DESC="foreign">, for of that the wise King speaketh, <HI>Prov.</HI> xxii. 6. <HI>Teach a child in the trade of his youth,</HI> that is, as <HI>Rabbi Ionah</HI> expounds it, teach him <HI>pausatim paulatim, ut ferre pos|sit</HI>; nor is it an instruction like that of <HI>Tyro</HI>'s, who learn methods of War and Com|bat by exercise; for then the word would have been <GAP DESC="foreign">, as the <HI>Psalmist</HI> uses it, <HI>Psal.</HI> xxxiv. 12. <HI>Come my little children, hearken unto me, and I will teach you the fear of the Lord</HI>: nor is it <GAP DESC="foreign">, such a fear as is preparatory to God's instruction, such, as <HI>Kimchi</HI> says, implyes, <HI>praeparationem verborum cujuspiam in alterum cum rationibus, &amp; ostensione juris</HI>; but it is chiefly <GAP DESC="foreign">, that is here used. And the Prophet's sense is, <HI>Learn to know God's mercy to you,</HI> that though he has prelated you, yet 'tis, that you should deny your selves what you might, to do what you ought.

And hence comes it to pass, that the <HI>Erudimini</HI> here has much more in the scope, then the meer phrase carryes with it.

takes off all those exuberances, that besot and lose Princes in obscenity and dissoluteness.

<P>So that all these considered, the <HI>Erudimini</HI> here has much in it, and a strong force it carryes to the gaining of Princes to follow it, if they would be subject to the reason of it, the Prophet is no lax and saint Rhetorician in this soft, yet significant language; but he does by a pathetique, <HI>arctare &amp; movere verbis,</HI> as our Text-Master comments on him; he does <HI>movere vigore,</HI> and <HI>arctare ratione,</HI> and as he sets all his spiritual love on work to perswade, so all his learned Reason to compel and over-rule the Judges of the Earth, <HI>scire institutum Dei, &amp; sequi disciplinatum legis</HI>; for as learned King <HI>Iames</HI> of happy memory once wrote.</P>

but in analogie of good wishes, would to God we had more good, and less bad Law|yers then we have. And this I wish, for God, the King, and the Countreys sake, that Religion, Allegiance, Justice, and Charity, might be, by their Learning and practice, the more and better promoted. But I return to the Text.</P>
<Q><P>Non enim ad eruditionem artis sactivae aut mechanicae h&igrave;c movet Propheta, cum non di|cat, <HI>Erudimini</HI> qui colitis terram, nec ad eruditionem scientiae tant&ugrave;m theoreticae quamvis opportuna fuerit incolis terrae, quia generaliter non dicit, <HI>Erudimini</HI> qui inhabitatis terram, sed sol&ugrave;m ad disciplinam legis, qu&acirc; judicia redduntur, reges specialiter invitat propheta in his verbis, <HI>Erudimini</HI> qui judicatis terram.</P></Q>
<P>These words our Text-Master adds, as an expatiation and ornament of his main Ar|gument; not that he thought it not sufficient to carry the weight he superstructed it, but to obviate any mistake of the sense of Scripture, apt to be distorted through pee|vishness, or mistaken by ignorance. To rectifie which digressions, from the intend|ment of the Prophet, our Chancellour proposes this allegation of the Holy Ghost's, as directly relative to Rulers of all ranks; not onely as they are men, for so they are con|cerned in common with all others; but also, and chiefly, as they are the highest and most influential of men, either to good or evil. And because they may be engaged to do good, their Architect who has built their power so many Stories high beyond other mens, whose foundations are more in the dust, and whose houses are of Clay, when theirs are of Cedar and Marble; whose Companions are the Dogs of the Flock; when these sit among the Gods, is by the Prophet more presly catechetique to Princes, not onely to call them to, but to instigate them by the commemoration of their received bounties from God, to learn their duty, and practice their subjection to, and zeal for him, that has so dignified them.</P>
<P>It's true indeed, there is an <HI>Erudimini,</HI> which all men, at all times, in all stations, need; the Apostle, by the Spirit of God, calls on Christians to study, and exhibit to view that Catholicon that cures prejudice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 4.5.</NOTE> and commends to peace and Charity, <HI>Let your mo|deration,</HI> saith he, <HI>be known to all</HI>; and there are particular Scriptures exhortative to men in mechanique and active Callings, which are to be heeded, God has left no man without his <HI>mortalis genius,</HI> his <GAP DESC="foreign">; yea, and his Monitor from above, such Scripture-dictates as if he follow, he will please God, and pleasure himself in the peace of a rightly informed from, and rightly conforming Conscience to, God. To this purpose are Scriptures applicable to particular conditions: <HI>The Priests are to read the Law,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mark 9.50. 2 Tim. 2.15. 1 Cor. 9.19. Mal. 2.7. 1 Tim. 5.17.

Phil 3.14.</NOTE> <HI>to preserve their savour as salt, and lustre as light, to study to shew themselves work-men; To carry Consciences void of offence both towards God, and towards men; To become all to all, that they may gain some; and the people are to enquire the Law at the Priests lips.

degrees of men. But this Scripture before us, <HI>Erudimini qui judicatis terram,</HI> is the Scripture that concerns Kings and Judges, that they should consider what God requires from them, and what their Prelacies, <HI>ex aequo,</HI> imports them to do. And this, if ever any man did, I believe our late King <HI>Charles</HI> the blessed, was taught by God to do: Hear him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eicon. Basilic. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 19. <HI>p.</HI> 177.</NOTE> <HI>I never had any victory, which was without my sorrow, because it was on mine own Subjects, who, like</HI> Absalom, <HI>dyed many of them in their sin; and yet I never suffered any defeat, which made me despair of God's mercy and defence: when Providence gave me, or denied me victory, my desire was neither to boast of my power, nor to charge God foolishly, who I believed at last would make all things work together for my good. I wished no greater advantages by the War, then to bring mine enemies to moderation, and my friends to peace. I was afraid of the temptations of an absolute Conquest, and never prayed more for victory over others, then over my self: When the first was denied me, the second was granted me, which God saw best for me.</HI> This was the Piety and probity of a King, <HI>vi|vendo nobilis, moriendo nobilior,</HI> which I believe he had conveyed to him, through the mercy of God, by the instructions of his learned and pious Father of happy memory King <HI>Iames,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Basilicon.

<P>By these, and the like senses, which good Kings have had of their duty to God and men, it appears, that the Prophet's words here to Kings, are of more consequence, by how much they tend by the greatest project, to end in the greatest emolument, that of <HI>Kings</HI> bettered both to God and men in their beneficence, as I may so say to both, in that they do as <HI>Marcus Antoninus</HI> advises,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 4. <HI>Sect.</HI> 2. <HI>p.</HI> 23.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp;c. <HI>Do nothing rashly nor vainly, nor otherwise, then as exactly corresponds with the rule.</HI> When they do as Artists do,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gatakeri An|notat. <HI>n lib.</HI> 4. <HI>sect.</HI> 2. <HI>p.</HI> 122.</NOTE> <HI>in minutissimis quib&uacute;sque artis suae, &amp; praecepta observant, &amp; specimen edunt, it &agrave; &amp; Apelles ex lineae unicae ductu solo, Protogeni innotuit,</HI> saith this learned Commen|tator on him.</P>
<P>Which considered, as good Princes are to be ever solicitous of their duties, and vigi|lant over their thoughts and works, that they wander not to an eccentricity, and disho|nour themselves by the returns of the ventures they have made unhappily on them: So are all good Subjects to pray for their Princes in secret, and pitty their temptations, rather then revile their seductions by them.

<P>This is quoted, as it is added in the <HI>Psalm,</HI> to acculeate the perswasion, to learn to know how to judge for, as God, that is righteously. For though it be enough to a good man, to do what is good and just, because good and just are the properties of God, and the provisions of his Institution in Magistracy: yet forasmuch as the servility of our nature being the effect of sin, evidences us more driven by fear, then drawn by love, the Holy Ghost has brought up the duty with a danger in the failer of it: And the sense is this, that the wisdom of God is not to be perverted by us, nor the power which he has intrusted great men with, to be abused to rage and fury, which is but the back|side, and dark Representation of that Cloud, in which Magistracy is wrapped, for its fur|ther and fuller awe on Mankinds disorders, left God reveal from Heaven his wrath a|gainst such unrighteousness of great men, and they perish from the right way, that is, lest when they are too big for men to deal with, God take them short by death, or other anticipation, and they have not the just power continued to them, which, while they had, they unjustly abused. And this indeed, is a great Argument, which should move men in power to study knowledge, and practice of their duty; to consider, that God is higher then they, that they are but dispensers of his talents; and that therefore they ought to carry wise minds, and wary hands, in ordering publique affairs.

<P>Still our Chancellour fills the Prince's ears with fresh Reasons; fain he would that he should be just, who is a King's Son, and he hopes is to be a King in God's time: And here|upon, as he had formerly acquainted him, that Justice he must know and practice; sonow he tells him, that the must do what he does not so much in policy, as in love to Justice: not because he would be well thought and spoken of; not for that it is commodious to fix Government, though this is a warrantable motive; but from love to Justice, as the imi|tation of God, and a partaking of his essential perfection in such a measure as we are ca|pable of, and it is possible to be derived on us. And hereupon Princes are to love Justice, and to hear the Laws that commend it;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 1. De Absti|nentia, <HI>p.</HI> 7.</NOTE> which Laws were not made by men of force, <GAP DESC="foreign">, as <HI>Porphyrus</HI>'s words are, but <GAP DESC="foreign">, by wise and worthy men, who considered them, as they were suitable to the rea|son of Nature, and the Religion of right Reason. And thus our Chancellour presses it from the first of <HI>Wisdom,</HI> v. 1. as both a Moral Divinity, and a Divine Morality. That which both to <HI>Heathens</HI> and <HI>Christians</HI> as men, is commendable, and without it, what|ever is seraphiquely pretended in either, is just nothing. For whereas the Text in <HI>Wisdom</HI> is, <HI>Love righteousness, ye that be Iudges of the Earth</HI>: our Translators refer|ring to Texts in the Canon, suitable to this <HI>Apocrypha</HI> in the Margent, mentioned 1 <HI>Kings</HI> iii. 3. The words are, Solomon <HI>loved the Lord, walking in the Statutes of</HI> Da|vid <HI>his Father</HI>; and <HI>Esay</HI> lvi. 1. where the words are, <HI>Thus saith the Lord, keep ye Iudgment, and do Iustice</HI>: which put together, do in their, and any good man's sense, amount to our Chancellour's drift, That to love Righteousness, is to love the Lord the fountain of it, and the best way to see him with his reward with him, that is, with comfort and salvation from him, is to keep Judgment, and do Justice, that is, to do Justice, by keeping Judgment, since no King can be just to his own power, and peoples preservation, who keepeth not the Judgment to discern of good and evil, and dili|gently searcheth not out the conveniencies and contraries that are in his Government, and suits not Laws congruous to them. And so our Chancellour, and I after him, con|clude the fourth Chapter.</P>

The consideration of which, in the consequence of it, has dictated to men, prudently to acquiesce in the judgments of learned and well-parted men, as the competentest distributers of Justice to the rest of the World, who being better qualified to act, yet are less exact in matters of design and decision then they: So that the great work of enablement to Legislation, for which <HI>Fabius</HI> and <HI>Sabinus</HI> were called the <HI>Cato</HI>'s; <HI>Domitius Vlpian,</HI> and <HI>Iulius Paulus,</HI> the two Poles <HI>Vertices Legum; Pomponius</HI> the Oracle skill'd, <HI>usque ad finibriam &amp; ex|trema scientiarum; Papinian Iuris Asylum, the Prince of Law, and Refuge of distress:</HI> I say, that which proclaimed these so useful in their times, was the universal Science they had of right and wrong, good and evil, and the Catholique disquisition that they had made of the usages and apprehensions of Nations, and men concerning them.</P>

And hence comes it to passe that learning is so necessary for a man in power. For learning in a man of power and place makes him unprejudiced, and cleares his Eyesight to an Eagle-eyed clarity, it distinguishes between Subjects and accidents, between what learning does, and what the man in which learning is, does; and when it condemns the man, it justifies his art; hence comes <HI>Quintilian</HI> to account arts happy, if Artists onely judged of them: because, they will not onely value them as they are, but not undervalue them for some adjunct defects; <HI>Protogenes</HI> valued one plain line of <HI>Apelles,</HI> and the foam, or any minute and unbeauti|fied particle of Picture from <HI>Zeuxis,</HI> or any he that does <HI>pingere aternitatem.</HI> Or one sentence of Masculine wit boldly and bravely worded, shall have more Commendation from a knowing and accomplished Master, then all the <HI>Hecatombs</HI> and <HI>Pyramids</HI> of rodo|montado'd Impertenances, which are Darlings to the <HI>plebs,</HI> shall have: whereas others judge of arts as blinde men do of colours, hab-nab, hit or miss, no matter whether, crying up as the superstitious <HI>Athenians</HI> did, a false god; nay inscribing an Altar to the unknown God, when they decry the true one onely God; so they advancing trite, vain vile, artlesse art, decry real and regular art, reversing the Escutcheon of recti|tude, and making that vile which is excellent, as <HI>Polaemon</HI> the Grammarian did by <HI>Marcus Varro,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Petrus Crinitus <HI>lib.</HI> 9. <HI>c.</HI> 10.

humble and submiss then they; I say while men and things are thus misjudged, and the keen edge of ill will, or the blunt of ignorance is turned to them in their judgement of them, no <HI>Halcyon</HI> dayes of art can be hoped for.

<P>If knowledge be the window that lets in love, ignorance is the nusance that annoyes and obscures the light and lustre of it, for it does not onely cause an inexpression of love, but an expression of hatred its contrary, since hatred of good arises from igno|rance of it; for did we know good to be what it is, we would love it as we ought, which caused the Philosopher not onely to light a Candle at noon day, to seek a wise man in the multitude; but professe that if virtue could be denuded, so that men could see her pulchritude, they would be impatient to be absent from her, and to be in any condition without her.</P>

to make use of them; nor numbers of men, but discipline and courage, that declares a man rich, learned, fortunate, victorious; so is it not the notion, but practice of Philoso|phy, that derives on men the honour of being true Philosophers.

<P>Which premised, the divisions of Philosophy into parts, is rather a matter of me|thod and order, then any thing else; and since it is the contemplation of wisdom, in preparation for action, can have no variety in it, but what is gradual, and has a sense of ministration to the consequution of the noble end of it, to wit, how to know to do.</P>
<P>Whereunto, because the several Attoms and minute Particles (making the mass and bulk) with the variety of their use, and operation in ascent to the culmen of it, is to be considered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Anead. 1. <HI>lib.</HI> 3. <HI>p.</HI> 21.</NOTE> which perhaps is somewhat towards that which <HI>Plotinus</HI> lays down, <GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp;c. <HI>the understanding gives perspicuous principles, which done, the soul compounds couples, and distributes them, till they come to perfect understanding.</HI> I crave leave therefore not so much to cherish and confirm debate of words, and variety of ex|pression, as to write somewhat useful to the practical Philosophy, to which the specula|tive is but ducent.

<P>Order then is to be kept in Sciences, which will best be done by love to them, found|ed upon knowledge of them; for whence come heats but upon ignorance, on the as|saylants part, and zeal of knowledge on the Defendants: the composure of which will best be brought about by their unanimity, to credit study with practice. For when all is done that art can witness to, and woo the world by to love her; if it leave the man that has it like <HI>Barlaam</HI> the <HI>Monk,</HI> whom the Historian makes a rare Critique in <HI>Eu|clid, Aristotle, Plato,</HI> but vitiating all this <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>by filling a peaceable Church with discord and cavils,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Contacuzenus Hist. <HI>lib.</HI> 2. <HI>c.</HI> 39.</NOTE> <HI>fire-balls thrown about by his wit.</HI> Better I say, know nothing, then thus to know any thing: better to know a little usefully, then much to no other end; but to dishonour God, and disturb men.</P>
<P>As then there must be knowledge in Science to make men value them, so where there is not, there will be contempt of them, which their followers not enduring, proceeds to enmity at last between them; yea, and if the learned side get the Victory by argument, yet if they have not a strenuity of practice to consort with their learning, well they may obtain of men flashes of fame, but real and true Victors they will not be. <HI>Philo</HI> elegantly reasons this with the learned man in these words,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> De ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i|num mutatione. <HI>p.</HI> 1055.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp;c. <HI>What reason,</HI> says he, <HI>hast thou, O man, to consider the nature of Heavenly bodies, and vault up into the knowledge of things beyond thy reach: What sensuality hast thou by this skill purged out of thee?

<P>From all which, argued upon occasion of our Texts instance of Arts so far, and no farther loved then known, the conclusion is, that knowledge is the key to love, and all the fruits of it. And where it truly and soberly is, does not heighten passion, but trims and polishes it to a serious purpose, that is, to magnifie God, accord with men, and exem|plifie virtue in a daily practice of it; which well executed, will evidence to men, that God has made a connection of Sciences, and that where any truly is, there are such de|grees of universality,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Caelius Calcagni|nus <HI>nepoti suo. Quaestionum, lib.</HI> 2.</NOTE> as make men civil to those Arts they are not Masters of, and rude Dictators in nothing that is cryptique and mutable: so true is that of <HI>Calcagninus, It&agrave; juncta &amp; copulata sunt inter se natur&acirc;, &ugrave;t sine piaculo disjungi non possunt; nam sicut. in corpore humano nihil frustr&agrave; positum est, quod ad suum opus est institutum, caterisque par|tibus respondeat, ut non sine pernicie avelli possit, it&agrave; disciplina, id est, humanae vitae mem|bra inter se connexa sunt, ut seorsim positae mancae &amp; mutiles sunt, nemo ergo Phisica sine Logicis, nemo Logica sine Mathematicis, nemo omnia sine orationis praesidio assequatur.</HI></P>
<P>Though therefore, there may be upon various degrees of apprehension, more or less proportions of zeal and indifferency towards Arts, and the Rules of them, accord|ing to the measure of mens expending of themselves upon them; yet will there ever be in true Philosophers such a moderation, as keeps from the <HI>deridebit</HI> of our <HI>Text.</HI> For though our Chancellour phrases thus the effect of ignorance and disaffection, yet does

<P>This Clause was that for which the fore-going was instanced in; for the Chancel|lour intending instigation of the Prince to the study of the Law, as before he had infor|ced it from the excellency of the Law, as the guide to Justice, which Justice he propo|ses as the desert of fame, and the foundation of duration in Government: so now does he in this Clause shew how impossible it is to love what we know not, and to be zea|lous for that, which our Conviction of the excellency and use of it, does not excite us to. And this, as he does rhetorically, by presenting the worst effect of ignorance, op|position, and that with vehemence of whatever is unknown to, and unbeloved by us, so does he discover the dreadful effect of that prepossession by <HI>deridere,</HI> a carriage of contempt and vilipendency. And this he tells the Prince, if he knows not the Law, he will make appear by his personal demeanour to men of Law, whom thereby he will disoblige and discourage. To prevent which, he inculcates his counsel of him to the study of the Law, which alone can make him love it, because acquaiut him with, and sit him for the execution of it.</P>
<P>The great consequence of which wise men fore-seeing, do so direct Princes in their edu|cation, that next the knowledge of God, they prefer the instruction of them in the Laws of their Polities above all other parts of breeding, as that which mightily relievs them in all the exigencies of Government, and shews them the Prescript of serenity, if any there be in those heights of honour and sublimation, which <HI>Charles</HI> the 5. assured his Son he never found in them; and thereupon in the Session at <HI>Bruxels,</HI> when he resigned up the Government to <HI>Philip</HI> the second his Son, he thus spake to him, <HI>Compatlor tibi, mi fili,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>I pity thee my Son, on whise shoulders, by my resignation of my Crown and Go|vernment
<PB N="95" REF="59">
to thee, I put a very weighty burthen; for in all the years that I possessed it, I enjoyed not a minutes time of ease and joy, free from cares and fears.</HI></P>
<P>So that the Chancellour's application to the Prince in the precedent clause, being con|firmative of <HI>nihil amatum nisi cognitum,</HI> points at some inconveniencies; which unskil'd|ness in the Law will devolve on him.</P>
<P>First, the Municipe Law, which is obvious and clear, <HI>Angliae perito &amp; in lege Angliae docto,</HI> will be strange to him.</P>
<P>Secondly, he will be to seek of the Law and reason of that, which as King he must de|fend, and according to which, by his Judges in his Courts, he must determine in cases of the half and whole blood.</P>
<P>Thirdly, he will not know whether estates go, if they have no legal Inheritour, and the owner of them dies, <HI>sine haerede sanguinis.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, he will be grieved, when he sees the ill effects of them, which are onely avoided, and the trouble of them waded through by knowledge of mind.</P>
<P>Fifthly, a Prince will know, that if ignorance does so incommodate him and his af|fairs, and art so promote and beautifie them, in pure Justice this art and knowledge, where by such advantages are acquired, ought to be promoted and valued, since <HI>ars non habet inimicum praeter ignorantem.</HI></P>
<P>First, As all arts are obvious to Artists, so is it in the Lawes, they are plain <HI>peritis, &amp; in legibus doctis,</HI> such the Chancellor calls not those <GAP DESC="foreign">, who are all for prate and noise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1.

<P>Fourthly, These things as they are obvious to men of parts, study, and businesse in the Law, so would be very troublous and hard for a Prince to understand, that wholy neglects the consideration of them; to prevent which, the Chancellour conjures the Prince to study the Law, that he may be ready in understanding of, and right judge|ment concerning it.</P>
<P>And lastly, All the precedent Arguments he presses to hinder a dangerous and ne|cessary effect of ignorance, Enmity to Art and Law: for notwithstanding all the good Offices, Knowledg of Art, and of that of the Law, doth, yet will it not carry a letter|lesse minde above a barbarons hatred of that which is most beneficial; nor has ever learning been more coursly dealt with, then from those that know it least, <HI>Ars non ha|bet inimicum nisi ignorantem.</HI></P>
<P>For God having made man after his own Inage, in the Endowments of his reason|able Soul, with those Perfections in remiss Degrees which are eminently in himself, has no doubt in him, if improved to the utmost of his ingenuity, a capacity to act to the life the specifique actions of every creature under his Subjection, as <HI>Phavorinus</HI> very notably asserts:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Parte prim&aacute;</HI> De Excell. Hom. <HI>c.</HI> 55. <HI>p.</HI> 160.</NOTE> and that he does not effect great things by the illuminations of his in|tellect, proceeds, partly from the penal accessions of sin, which have blunted their edg, and dulled their perception; and partly from the torpor and negligence of us, who do not put forth what of the remains of our creation is yet upon us. From whence alone it is, that we are so ignorant of our duty, and so unprovided to comply with the Pro|vidences of God towards us: this makes us ignorant of and pertinacious against things, because we are at a losse concerning them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ep.</HI> 56.</NOTE> <HI>Si bona fide sumus,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>If we were in ear|nest, and answered the Prescript of God, we would contemn the meretricious avocations of this world, no delights of sense should interrupt our commerce with divine objects; 'tis a light wit that lookes nothing inward, but is wholy swallowed up in the gaity of externals.</HI> And in his 95. Epistle, <HI>Totum mundum</HI> (saith he) <HI>scrutor,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>I search the whole world and give my self a liberty of delight, great things rouse me up to contemplate their tran|scendency, this makes me fortified against all unpleasing accidents, which I eye not as ca|sualties, but God's designs, which I am readily to comply with, and chearfully to follow, not as that I cannot, but will not wave, because it is the best fruit of my duty.</HI> Thus does Divine learning fit a man to deny himself, and to be free to persue the Errand of his Maker, St. <HI>Ierom</HI> tells us, that <HI>Hippias</HI> the Philosopher called by the Greeks <HI>Omni|scius,</HI> was wont to glory that he made every thing about him with his own hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ep. ad</HI> Heliodor.</NOTE> while he had a knowing head, and a contented minde, his hand was able to supply him with necessaries to nature; and for humour and phantasie he had the Mastery of those; his
<PB N="97" REF="60">
learning had made him free from all those little states and airy Punctilio's, that ignorance affects, and now he being arrived at wisdom, was by it manu-mitted: no wonder then <HI>Galen</HI> calls arts, <GAP DESC="foreign">, and <HI>Aristotle</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, and <GAP DESC="foreign">, which <HI>Budeus</HI> opposes to those,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In reliquis pan|dectis p.</HI> 298.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="foreign">, and <GAP DESC="foreign">, be|cause when these deceive a man, and prove no subtersuges in want; the liberal arts are a kind of portable Mines, and Magnetequ's that draw fame and fortune to them every where, which confirms that as all knowing men do love Knowledg in others and promote it, so none are Enemies to, and oppose themselves against it, but such as are ignorant; which that the Prince may not be, the Chancellour proceeds to dehort him in the subsequent words.
<Q><P>Sed absit &agrave; te, fili Regis, ut inimiceris legibus regni, quo tu successurus es; vel, ut eas spernas quum justitiam deligere, praedicta sapientae lectio te erudiat.</P></Q>
These words do signifie some fears in the Chancellour, and those probably not ground|lesse ones, that the Prince being young, bred abroad, and martially addicted, might be drawn by those treacherous lures of love and revenge, to decline the love of the common-Law, and admire some other Law, which had more complyance with abso|lutenesse, and Martial rigour then our Law has: now this the grave Judge foreseeing of evil consequence, the people of <HI>England</HI> admiring nothing above their Lawes, nor loving any Governor further then he rules according to them; he seriously dehorts him from, and cautions him against such humours, and that not cooly and Courtlyly, but by an amicitial vehemence, and oratorious <HI>Pathos,</HI> in which all arguments of dis|swasion were couched.</P>
<P><HI>Absit &agrave;te,</HI> as much as if he had said, Sir, such an errour in judgement and choice becomes you not, nay rather you are so to abominate, as men do Carrions, and Sacri|ledges, Incests and Sodomies; the Hebrews expresse this <HI>absit</HI> by <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>quod pro|phane &amp; impurae rei notionem habet,</HI> and the learned say 'tis used <HI>c&ugrave;m rem diram atque atrocem abominamur,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Masius <HI>in</HI> Josh xxii. 29.</NOTE> when the Children of <HI>Reuben</HI> were charged to have built an Altar to confront God's Altar, their answer begins with this <HI>absit, God forbid that we should rebel against the Lord, and turn this day from following the Lord,</HI> c. xxii. v. 24. <HI>res prophana est, servis tuis hujusmodi facinus designare,</HI> so the <HI>Chaldee</HI> Paraphrase; <HI>absit abominantis sermo est, Estius, Erasmus,</HI> and <HI>Grotius</HI> jointly affirm, and so Saint <HI>Paul</HI> uses it, <HI>Rom.</HI> iii. 4, 6, 13. vi. 2, 15. vii. 13. ix. 14. xi. 1. 1 <HI>Cor</HI> vi. 15. <HI>Gal.</HI> ii. 17. iii. 21. vi. 14. yea the Jews long afore <HI>Gen.</HI> xliv. 7. 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> xii. 13. xx. 2. 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> xi. 19. <HI>Iob.</HI> xxvii. 5. <HI>Luk.</HI> xx. 16.</P>

<P>Especially when this to do, is an <HI>Inimiceris</HI>; for to be ignorant of the Law is not to love it, and not to love the Law the rule of justice, is to affect injustice, and to resolve ir|regularity, and that is to proclaim an enmity against the Law, and against such a Law as is the Law of your own Country, to which your Father and his Progenitors swore Observation, in the presence of the great God of Heaven, and the great men of your Nation.

<Q><L>Praedicta sapientiae lectio te erudiat.</L></Q>
<P>This refers not to the vulgar saying immediately before, <HI>Art hath no Enemy but ignorance</HI>; but to the passage out of the second <HI>Psalm,</HI> mentioned in the fourth Chap|ter, <HI>Be wise, O ye Kings, and be instructed, ye Iudges of the Earth, Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way.</HI> Which being the counsel of the Holy Ghost, and penned by his amanuensis, and that to the intent of pressing Justice on them (upon account of propitiating the chief Justice of quick and dead, the Son of God <HI>Christ Iesus</HI>) may well be called <HI>electio sapientiae,</HI> and justly termed <HI>illos erudire</HI>; for if any prudence be by man in this militant state expressed, 'tis this, <HI>of laying up a good foundation, of labour|ing for the meat that perisheth not,</HI> of confirming him our friend, who is commissionated by God with all power in Heaven and Earth. And if any method be more indubitate and exquisite to this end then other, 'tis that which Justice, known, beloved, and pra|ctised, directs us how, when, and where to use, this virtue therefore as the rapsody and accumulation of all excellency. Our Chancellour does evertouch upon, as that which is <HI>subjectum regalis curae,</HI> and without which the <HI>foundations of the Earth will be out of order.</HI></P>
<Q><P>Iterum igitur, atque iterum, Princeps inclytissime, te adjuro, ut leges regni patris cui successurus, addiscas.</P></Q>
<P>The consequence of Justice, as our Chancellour has largely explicated in the fourth Chapter, so does he here re-intimate, by his earnest and vehement conjuration, seising upon all that is tender and noble in him, to love and embrace Justice, treasured up in the Laws of <HI>England.</HI> And first he bespeaks him to do this, as what best becomes him, as he is <HI>Princeps inclytissimus</HI>; the first Head on a Subjects shoulders; the second in the Kingdom, because the Heir, but one degree, as was supposed, on this side the Throne; and then he is as <HI>Inclytissimus,</HI> one that was for endowment of mind as conspicuous, as for external accomplishment acclamated; for so <HI>Inclytus</HI> (of which <HI>Inclytissimus</HI> is the superlative) signifies in its bare positive notion, <HI>inclytus, insignis, gloriosus, veluti ful|gore quodam samae resplendens.</HI> Hence every thing of remarkable and signal eminency, is expressed by this word. <HI>Livy</HI> writing of the justice of the elder <HI>Romane</HI> times, expresses it thus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Livius I. <HI>aburts</HI> 73. Plautus <HI>in milite</HI> Virgil 6.

And then the Chancellour's edge to propend the Prince to the Law, as the rule of Justice expresses it self by such rhetorical Charms as are not to be avoided, <HI>Iterum atque iterum te adjuro,</HI> a form of compreca|tion, which emphatizes it self in the reduplication,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2.

<P>This Clause has indeed the marrow of all perswasion in it; for it not onely acquaints the Prince with what is fit for him to learn from the Law concerning Justice, as it is therein prescribed; but it presents him with solid Reasons, why in love to himself, and in reason resulting from it, the Law (<HI>ars aequi &amp; boni</HI>) ought to be known, and de|lighted in by him.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ea debent in hi|storia poni ab</HI> Hi|storiographis. <HI>qua aut sugienda sint aut sequen|da</HI> Julius Capitolin. <HI>in</HI> Gordian. <HI>Tr. p.</HI> 238. <HI>edit.</HI> Sylb. Cic. <HI>lib.</HI> 1, <HI>offic</HI> 23. 2 De Nat. Deorum 78.</NOTE> And these Reasons are privative, and positive. There are incon|veniencies, that a Prince by knowledge of the Law shall avoid, and there are advantages to be acquired; for by knowledge love is gained, and by love delight in, and joy at the prevalence of the Law over injury and disorder. This is the sum of this Clause. And indeed what can be prescribed to a Prince's accomplishment, which this method leads not to: For as to attain conveniencies, is to possess ones self of virtue; so to avoid inconveniencies, is to shun all the diversions from it, and from the comfort of its enjoyment. As then <HI>convenientia</HI> is an Oratour's word for fitness and aptitude of any thing to our purpose, and that in a measure of proportion between extreams, as whole|some and nutritive diet is called convenient food by <HI>Agur,</HI> and a house suitable to ones degree and family, a convenient house, and a fortune proportionable to a man's charge and breeding, a convenient fortune, and a wind to fill out the sails, yet not en|danger the Mast, a convenient wind; so is <HI>inconvenientia</HI> the opposite thereto, betokening exaberance, and somewhat uncomely redundant: which flaw in the Chrystal, or rather Adamant of Princes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide</HI> Heresba|chium, <HI>lib.</HI> De Educandis Prin|cipum liberis.</NOTE> much abates them. For as in <HI>Architecture,</HI> the essential beauties of building are delight, firmness, convenience; so in the formation of Princes minds, and in the building of them up to their after glory, no delight in, no firmness of their esteem, except there be a proportionation of their loves and natures to the Nation they preside over. The best help to which is, the knowledge of Laws, for they rightly understood and conformed to, take away wholly, or at least lessen inconveniencies in Government; so that the rule of Law, <HI>Quod est inconveniens aut contra rationem non est permissum in lege,</HI> reduces inconveniencies of disproportion to the Law, as the first-born of Reason, the King is <HI>caput regui &amp; legum</HI>; for an inconvenience it would be, that the Head should be thought incapable to direct, judge, and order, what is to be done, both regally and judicially. The King is, though a Child, <HI>plevae aetatis</HI>; it would be inconvenient that his Council should not supply his corporal inabilities, during his personal nonage. The King can do no wrong, because he judges <HI>in curia,</HI> by Judges, and not <HI>in camera</HI> by his Will, and it would be inconvenient, it otherwise should be. These, and such like in|conveniencies, being <HI>publico malo,</HI> and injurious to the compleat and indefectuous be|ing of Majesty, the Law supplies, by directing how they shall either not wholly be, or
<PB N="101" REF="62">
be wholly compensated for. Thus as men stop up an inconvenient light, and fill an in|convenient Pond, and repair an inconvenient way, and improve an inconvenient house, and change an inconvenient air, and avoid inconvenient company and diet; so does a wise Prince by the Law judge of what is inconvenient in Government, and either wholly abrogate, or mutilate and new form it to an improvement; and hereby does he avoid the inconveniencies of either real vilipendency, (for in that he discerns by the Law evil from good, he vindicates his knowledge of, and affection to the means of such his judiciousness) or reputed negligence, which being so great a fear to him, will best be disowned by his acceptation of the Laws for his rule to govern by. For he that governs men rationally by Laws, and justly by the Laws of their own Government; doth not onely <HI>intra se vivere &amp; addiscendo leges sapere,</HI> but appeals to God for prote|ction and success in his Government, and cannot easily fall into the paroxisms and di|stempers, which extrajudicial courses occasion, and in which Princes and people are un|happy. For a sure rule it is, <HI>vim facit qui patitur,</HI> Princes that either abate their Sub|jects of their rights, or suffer themselves to be abated (by their Subjects) of their Royal Rights, are accessary to the inconveniencies that follow them, and by so much the less know they the Law, as they permit the invasion and breach of it, either in themselves, or others. The Chancellour then that counsels, <HI>quomodo tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> evites has inconvenientias,</HI> is well to be listened to; for as the counsel is grave in the conception and mind of the giver, so is it generous wise and affectionate in its tendency and scope, which is <HI>gravem &amp; securum reddere principem, dum modum rect&egrave; evitandi inconvenientias, &amp; realis &amp; sup|positiae ignorantis legis addiscit.</HI> For since the mind of man will be busie in some disquisitive activity, and natural desires are to nothing but what is either really and in very deed good, or else semblably, and in appearance such, which is the reason, the Schools say, <HI>finis &amp; bonum convertuntur,</HI> the Chancellour does wisely and worthily, to bespeak the Prince's youth to adhere to the Law, as his choice and pleasure, and to expect no good as a man, and a King, but such as that informs him of, prepares him for, and onely will render useful to him; as <HI>Antoninus Pius</HI> found it, who by the <HI>Historian</HI> is chara|ctred to be <GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp;c. <HI>An honest upright private man, but signally, and to a greater degree, honest and upright, when made publique. For no sooner was he in the Throne; but he grew the admiration of all; terrible he was to none, bountiful to all; moderate in using power, a preser<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er of just men to rule under him.</HI> Learning then in the Law must not onely enter the Prince in the love, but confirm and establish him in such love, to a delight in,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>O praeclara infor|matio doctrina rum munere cale sti indulta felici|bus quae vel vitto|sas naruras sape excolusti.</HI> Ammi|anus Marcelli|nus, <HI>lib.</HI> 29 <HI>p.</HI> 483. <HI>in</HI> Valentiliano <HI>&amp;</HI> Valente.</NOTE> and a resolution of prelating the Law above all. For else, as in a calm, the ship moves not though all the sails be out; and in the midst of dainties, there is yet want where there is no stomach; so in the love of the Law, there will be but remiss|ness, if knowledge and valuation of its use, enhance not its appreciation, valuation is the daughter of discovery and Science, and so far do we esteem, as we understand: there|fore all the ports of Science are to be set open, that love and delight may enter at them; yea, and daily increase, as the knowledge of them increaseth. For so it follows in the words.</P>
<Q><P>Quo doceris quod si leges praedictas quas jam ignoras; intellexeris per doctrinam, cum optimae illa sint, amabis eas, &amp; quanto plus easdem mente pertractaveris, delectabi|li&ugrave;s tu frueris.</P></Q>
<P>This the Chancellour subjoyns by way of application, for having reasoned before with him, that knowledge causes love, and love desires to enjoy, and enjoyment fixeth delight, and crowns it with a <HI>non ultra</HI> of felicity, he deduces this from it, <HI>That the Laws of</HI> England <HI>being the measure and Mistris of her Governours happiness, not to know them, is not to know how and whereby to be happy</HI>: And therefore he advises him once and again, not onely to content himself onely to know there is a Law, and to appoint men of Learning to judge in Courts of Law according to the Law, and to see that right be done to all, as well poor as rich, and to punish them that do contrary; though this, I say, be a rare Princely virtue: yet is not this the very specifique virtue, he perswades the Prince hereto; which is <HI>intelligere leges per doctrinam,</HI> that is, <HI>to dig for the wis|dome of them, as for hidden treasure: to knock early, often, and loud at Wisdoms gate; to gain by search, and sweat, the language, terms, books, sense, and reason of the Laws, and

<Q><P>Nam omne, quod amatur, trahit amatorem suum in naturam ejus; unde &ugrave;t dicit Philo|sophus, usus altera fit natura.</P></Q>
These words give the reason of the former from the mouth of Nature by the hand of her Secretary <HI>Aristotle,</HI> whose position is, that love is of a transforming quality, make|ing the lover become so much what it loves, that he rather lives where he loves,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tunde quantum vales,</HI> Anaxarchum <HI>non ranges, tunde quantum voles, opinionem non mutabis; nihil</HI> Anaxarchus <HI>bonum esse credi|dit, quod animi non esset, nihil malum quod ad animum non pertineret.</HI></NOTE> then where he lives; which is the reason, that of all the effects of love that's mentioned by <HI>Solomon,</HI> he is the most conclusive of this, <HI>Love is stronger then death</HI>; not onely because it survives and evicts death, having aboad in Heaven where death is not,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heinsius <HI>in</HI> Orat. <HI>de Stoica Philosophia an|nexa</HI> Senec. <HI>p.</HI> 48. <HI>ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI></NOTE> but chiefly because death can but part the bodyes, which by union of soules were combin'd in a fierce and firm resolvednesse of willing, nilling, joying, fearing, delighting, abhorring, chusing, refusing, imbracing, avoiding; but it cannot by its terrour cause those latent simi|larities to be inexpressive or neglectfull of keeping an unisone in touch and time: for while they continue a capacity to love, they will expresse the fervour and Constancy of the resolution they have to each other, and the reason is, because love is a perfect surprize and conquest which rests not in a bare Sympathy, but passes from those in|choat Novicisms to the <HI>non ultr&agrave;</HI> of Con-naturality; nor is it hard for any man or wo|man to be brought of to be of the same judgement, dyet, delight with those they love; for in the assimilation each to other is the Continuation maintained, and the Degrees of love sublimated: there was no Key to <HI>Sampson</HI>'s strength till the dallying with <HI>Dalilah</HI> delivered it to her, and taught her how to ruine him, who, but for that lubricity, had not been to be dealt with by <HI>Philistins</HI>; nor could <HI>David</HI>'s warmth so have afflicted his own Soul, and blasphemed his God, (as in the case of <HI>Vriah</HI> slain and <HI>Bathsheba</HI> en|joyed) it did, but that his love was the sole Provocation to that action of Infamy.</P>
<P>No wonder then the <HI>Philosopher</HI> attributes so much to use, as to call it as another Nature (<GAP DESC="foreign">,) and quotes <HI>Evenus</HI> his verses to confirm it.

Here the Text-Master instances the force of custome and conjunction from that, which is somewhat equivalent to it in vegetables, and has analogie in that kinde with the effects of virtues and vices on the minde; for though it be true, that no general rule is exempt from an exception, and no second cause is so absolute but may be overruled by its first cause, yet is it also ordinarily true, that God leaves Nature to her work, and impedes her not but upon high Concerns, and in notable Cases: indeed there are Instances that God, contrary to all humane probability, has brought men and things into esteem and renowne which have been unlikely so to be. <HI>Valerius Maxi|mus</HI> brings in <HI>Tarquinius Priscus</HI> in the Head of these,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 3. <HI>c.</HI> 4.</NOTE> a man born at <HI>Corinth,</HI> and <HI>Da|maratus</HI> a Hogherd his father, and a bastard to boot, yet for all this miraculously brought to <HI>Rome,</HI> and that with such multiform advantages to his greatnesse, that in short time, he grew the Love, Dread, and Soveraign of all degrees, and the Historian gives us such a Record of his Bravery, as eternally monuments him for a Mirrour of men, <HI>Dilatavit fines</HI> Romani <HI>Imperii,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>He enlarged the</HI> Romane <HI>Empire by brave Con|quests, he honoured the Solemnities of religion with additional graces to them, he made the Senate and Orders of Knighthood more ample and capacious for great merits; and besides these the great virtue in him, was, that he so demeaned himself in his charge, that the City of</HI> Rome <HI>had no cause to repent she chose a stranger for her Emperour, and passed by her own Sons.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 2.

These things, I say, have been and yet are at the pleasure of God further to permit, but this extra|ordinary course is not God's frequent Method of his Manifestation to men; his usual direction to Attainments are by Industry and Assuescency of ones self to labours of the minde and body, and by that he gives men the successe of facility and pleasure in that, which before they were habituated to, was difficult and displeasing; that as in Vege|tables, fruits generically the same, are reconciled in their specifique difference by in|serting them into one anothers stock, the Cyons of a Pare or Apple being grasted on the stock each of other, and Plumbs inoculated into each other will produce the fruit of the stock and kinde, into which they are let: so in the minde of men, there is a real transformation suitable to the nature of the Company men consort with, and the Ob|jects they fix their delight upon; for use begets an habit, and habits delight in suit|able activity, and such as the soul and minde of man is, such will be his delight either in good or evil,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> De beata vi|ta <HI>p.</HI> 654. <HI>lib.</HI> De Tranquil. <HI>p.</HI> 620.</NOTE> so true is that of <HI>Seneca, Natur&acirc; duce utendum est, hane ratio obser|vat, hanc consulit, idem est ergo beat&egrave; vivere &amp; secundum naturam,</HI> and surely where virtue is in the soul, <HI>in quocunque habitu est, prodest,</HI> as he notably.</P>
<P>For it is the <GAP DESC="foreign"> of virtue habituated to, and radicated in man, that transforms him; naturally he is void of all good, and sets himself in a resolved hostility against whatever is divine, and may dissociate him and his rude praepossessions by vice and enmity to virtue: but when God touches the natural Conscience, and causes the beauty of virtue to irradiate, when there is one Beam of discovery let into the understanding, of a more excellent way then it has found, this causes it so to augment and dilate itself in desires and endeavours, that at last it brings in the perfect discovery of virtue, and re|leases men from their bondage to sins service, so that they once being accustomed to be

<P>The former Clause was but illustrative of the force of Use and Custome; this is ap|plicative to the Prince, in the habituation of whose mind to Justice, as the Law pro|pounds

pounds it, there will be a suitable effect: For since all Laws that are just, being extracts out of the Law of God in nature, and the positive enlargement of it as emergencies required them, are to all respective Countreys, and the men in them, the measures of just and unjust; and the Law of <HI>England</HI> is such to the King and People respectively therein, his humble address to the Prince is, that the Law he would study, and by considering of, so delight in it, that his principles being Law and Justice, his practice may be also such, and so he not erre in Judgment, nor cause the people to wander out of the way by his ill example, or complain of hard usage under his Government, when God should reduce him to it. This is the scope of the Chancellour, which he wisely prosecutes, by not onely commending the Law as a study of delightful knowledge, the Magazine of Justice, but as that which is attainable to some kind of intellectual pleni|tude, I mean to such a proportion as is necessary for him: so that from knowledge of, he shall proceed to love, delight, and take a complacentiality in the Law, as the Scheme of Justice, that his mind ought to be conformed to, and thence his actions.

Thou hast not onely said to Kings, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>as much as Laws are not to be violated,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Inter dicta</HI> Phythagorae, <HI>apud</HI> Porphyrium <HI>in vita ejus,</HI> pag. 199.</NOTE> <HI>because they are the exemplars of Iustice, the glory of Crowns; and injustice in the Soul of a Prince, is the riot of sen|suality against Reason, and a warp of the less noble faculties from the Law of their conjunction with, and subserviency to the more no|ble</HI>: but thou hast (O Lord Jesus) to thine eternal honour and admiration,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Injustitia in anima, est ig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">bili|um partium &agrave; naturali lege dis|sidium.</HI> Tapia, <HI>lib.</HI> 9.<HI>p.</HI> 9. <HI>De Triplici bono &amp; ver&acirc; hominis nobilitate.</HI> Grot. <HI>in</HI> Locum.</NOTE> loved righteousness as thy choice, thy self, <HI>bonum tuum quiae bonum te</HI>; Oh! but how does that appear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the next words confirms it, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">disti iniquitatem,</HI> as thou lovest Justice, so thou hatest whatever is contrary to, and inconsistent with it. Thou hatest thy Scepter which is <GAP DESC="foreign">, should be other then of pure Gold, and endure the touch of all tongues, thine enemies be|ing Judges; thou wilt not by that oppress the weak, nor bruise the broken, but bind them up, because thy Scepter is like thy Kingdom, which represents all righteous|ness, having no fellowship with iniquity. Here, O holy soul, thine eyes may see the King of Saints in his beauty, far greater then <HI>Solomon</HI> in all his Royalty, <HI>loving Iustice, and hating iniquity,</HI> as never man or King did, or could do before, or ever can, or shall do after him. Now also consider the compensation that the Father is mentioned to give the Son for this his love to righteousness; that follows, <HI>Wherefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee</HI>; because thou art so qualified to rule as a King, God has called thee to Kinglyness by <HI>unction</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 2.</NOTE> <HI>as he has given thee a name above every name,</HI> so has he preferr'd thee in thy <HI>unction</HI> above all <HI>unctions</HI> of men. Their <HI>unctions</HI> make their heads and hearts often ake with care, because their affairs are sometimes disasterous, and at best troublesome: their Crowns gird their Brows, and make them bend them for pain; but <HI>God hath anointed thee, O blessed Iesus, <GAP DESC="foreign">, with such oyl, as chears and in|candorates thy face, (for <GAP DESC="foreign"> signifies the same with <GAP DESC="foreign">, oblectumentum, ornamentum, honestamentum.</HI>) God has put such sovereign oyl into the Springs of thy Rule,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 110 3. Cant. 1. 4.</NOTE> that thy Scepter easily turns thy Subjects to thee; <HI>Thy people are a willing peo|ple in this day of thy power, and they call unto thee to draw them, and promise to run after thee gladly and constantly, and all this above thy fellows</HI>; no Angels in Heaven, no Kings on Earth, are so anointed as the King of the Church was: For whereas their <HI>unction</HI> is but the work of art, Christ's <HI>unction</HI> was the work and spirit of God whereas theirs was but poured out in measure, Christ's was an effluxion of divine virtue without measure, whereas theirs was but temporary, as their Kingdoms are: Christ's was eter|nal and perpetual, as his Kinglyness is; whereas theirs was but to signifie their separa|tion and sanctification to the rule of their Subjects onely, and those onely during their lives, Christ's was emblematical of his indeterminable and capacious power, which was
<PB N="106" REF="65">
to extend to all persons, and to indure beyond all time; and therefore well expressed, <HI>Prae consortibus tuis, regibus terrae; quippe qui etiam habuit potestatem,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>For</HI> Christ <HI>the King of the Church had the prerogative above all Kings, to forgive all sins on Earth, and to have an everlasting Kingdom, as he had deserved, so to have his glory be by his pur|chase of it with his body on the Cross, which was an expiatory sacrifice for the sins of the World,</HI> as <HI>Manster</HI> and <HI>Clarius</HI> both on the Text.</P>
<P>This Scripture thus applyed to Christ, our Chancellour brings in here to his aid, the better to prevail upon the Prince to love the Laws, that declare the measure and pro|portion of <HI>English</HI> Justice: For as the end of Laws is to determine right and wrong,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Brompton <HI>in</HI> Chronicis, <HI>pag.</HI> 956, 958, <HI>edit.</HI> Londini.</NOTE> (and the Common-Laws of <HI>England</HI> were com|posed and methodized so to do out of the <HI>farrago</HI> of Laws that of old were here amongst us, and which <HI>Brompton</HI> says, were <HI>nimis par|tiales</HI>; and therefore by Saint <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessour meliorated,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Legum ministri magistratus, legum interpretes judices, legum idcirco omnes servi sumus, ut liberi esse possumus.</HI> Cic. <HI>pro</HI> Cluenti.</NOTE> and by all Princes added to, explained, or substracted from, as their wisdom in Counsel saw fit:) so is the exactest and unerringst me|thod of Justice to be learned by Prince and People from these Laws; which they that addict themselves to know, will love, and in loving be just and happy in life and death.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P><HI>HIc epilogat</HI> Cancellarius <HI>totius persuasionis suae effectus,</HI> saith the Editor of my Text in <HI>Hen.</HI> the 8. time on this Chapter: And not amiss, for having pre|discoursed of the excellency of Justice, and the consequentiality of its being, and being beloved in a King, who is to distribute it according to the Law of his Government, which Law known, will be delighted in, and conformed to by him: He now comes to annex, by way of motive and assurance, the felicities that do flow in upon just Princes, and do distinguish them from others, both in life and death. And this he doth; first, by telling him, that Righteousness and Justice is so peculiarly the Garment of Kings, that they must wrap up their whole man in it, as garments cover all the body, and the Robes of Princes are long from top to toe, significative of their plenary power and augustness. In which sense, God is said to put on Righteousness as a Garment, and the Saints are said to be cloathed in the garment of their elder brother, and that to ren|der them beloved.</P>
<P>So the Chancellour intimates to the Prince, that by knowledge of, and love to the Law, he shall be so invested with, and habituated to Justice, that it shall be his nature, and as impossible for him not to be just, as not to be in warmth motion and sense while living.</P>
<P>Secondly, he presents him with another benefit, <HI>ignorantiae legis evitare poteris igno|miniam,</HI> and that's no small one: For as ignorance is the botch and deformity of hu|mane nature, (which God has endowed with a reasonable soul, <HI>divinae particula aurae,</HI> and made capable by the vastness of its intellect, to understand and judge of all things:) so is ignorance of the Law in a Prince, so great a deformity, as no corporal one comes near in the despicableness of it. For as he will make but an ill oration, that knows not the rules of speaking, and he but a pitiful Sea-man, that skils not the use of the Com|pass, and he a rash Souldier, that considers not of the advantages and disadvantages,
<PB N="107" REF="65">
which he is to provide for in fighting; and he an ill Counsellour, who has never read the Rules of Policy, nor seen the effects of them in practice, so will he prove himself but a sost and despicable Prince, who knows little or nothing at all of the Law, accord|ing to which he is sworn to govern. For as all other mens eating, sleeping, fruitions, are inbeneficial to him, if he have not health to enjoy them himself; so is the know|ledge of all other things incontributive to his real quiet and effulgency; if in the Law, which is <HI>anima regiminis,</HI> he be unversed, and letterless, <HI>frustra foris strenu&egrave; si domi mal&egrave; vivitur.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. As knowledge of the Law will avoid the shame of ignorating it, so will it accrew a complication of positive goods, contributive to the comfort of life and acquirement of same after death, <HI>Per legem felicitate fruens beatus esse poter is in hac vit&acirc;,</HI> that is, the Conscience of just governing his people, according to his Oath and his Laws, which are their Birth-right, will give him such a calm and stability on his Subjects love, and such an humble confidence in God's mercy and protection, that he shall not fear the evil day that it should come on him; or if it do, he shall be assured to overcome it by magnanimity, and innocent Hectorism. And whereas guilt makes Kings <HI>succumbere,</HI> ashamed and unbold to assert themselves, the Justice of a royal soul, notably evidenced in a just Reign, shall make him that has it, more then a Conquerour in life, and no|thing less then a Martyr at death; yea, it shall go near, (though not come home to the pitch of merit, for that's no proper phrase in reformed Oratory and Doctrine.) to de|serve a Canonization, by the favour of him that accepts and re|wards all admirable actions flowing from virtuous principles;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quomodo justitiae vindex erit, qui expoliat alios? quomodo su|am amabit Remp. qui de The|sauris cogendis, dies, noct&eacute;sque cogitat? quomodo rebus agen|dis advertet animum, quilucro totus inhiat?

I say these effects of Justice, resulting from the knowledge and practice of the Law, will so exhilerate and quicken the spirits of a Prince, that he will not onely be calm within, and not incumbred with the terrours of the Almighty, but be abun|dantly beloved by his Subjects, live in peace and plenty, dye re|nowned and lamented, I <HI>King.</HI> iii. last <HI>v.

Since then it is incident to youth to be ill-principled, as he was,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In</HI> Nerone. <HI>c.</HI> 16.</NOTE> whom <HI>Suetonius</HI> reports, <HI>Luxuriam, libidinem, crudelitatem veluti juvenili errore exercuit</HI>; and as <HI>Coligui,</HI> who was heard often to say, <HI>That neither</HI> Alexander <HI>nor</HI> Ju|lius Caesar <HI>were superiour to himself,</HI> and the ill habits that are atcheiued then, are sel|dom if ever receded from, but remain as dead flies to inquinate the compositions of the most eminent virtues. It is of high concernment to inure the minde of youth to virtue and humility, to courage and justice, for this will so ballast and steer the after|ages, that nothing will disseise them but death, which is the great Usurper of all mor|tal glories and triumphs in their determination.</P>
<P>Which premised, our Chancellour does most worthyly to attack the youth of our Prince with such desensatives, as may abortivate the Attempts of passion and lubricity upon him; for in that he commends not airy Romances, not Po&euml;tique fictions, not parasitique drolleries, but sober reason and sacred Scripture to his rumination: what doth he lesse then endeauour to make his choice in youth, an Iliads to repose his fame in, and teach him to live in the glory of a matchlesse piety, far more then <HI>Homer</HI> did in his Poems; which yet <HI>Tully</HI> sayes were so contributive to their Author, <HI>Vt nisi Ilias extitisset illa, idem tumulus qui corpus ejus contexerat, nomen ejus obruisset.</HI></P>
<P>And truely if the holy Scriptures, which are the most antient record extant, far be|fore the <HI>Peleponesian</HI> war,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bochartus <HI>praefat. in lib. de</HI> Coloniis</NOTE> beyond which <HI>Thucydides</HI> acknowledges in the Greek stories nothing is certain, and which was but about <HI>Artaxerxes</HI> and <HI>Nehemiah</HI>'s time; I say, if the Scripture does discover to us, <HI>Moses, Iob, Samuel,</HI> three notable Instan|ces of sober youth, and such men in their age as few exceeded, and thus probably they became by the seasoning of their youth with piety and probity. Is there not much more from the authority of the Book, from whence these authorities are quoted, and the nature of the Instances hence made to perswade a Prince of reason and religion, then from any Ethnique Author, or lesse credible Examples: surely I think, yes, and so I believe the Chancellour doubted not but to convince the Prince of; for since the word of God is a sword and a Hammer to cut asunder and mall down all opposition a|gainst and interposition between it and its end and drift, the Chancellour has done well to draw forth this weapon to terrifie all contradictions, that he did but fear pro|bable; for since nothing became a young Prince more then readynesse to learn, and ductility to take learning in that Method his Tutors should convey it to him, it was a dexterous practice that our Chancellour uses to implant virtue by, to wit, the Com|mendation of Justice from the Law of God and the Law of <HI>England.</HI></P>

<P>As the former Clause had <HI>argumentum ab utili,</HI> so this has an argument <HI>&agrave; damno contrarii</HI>; if virtue be not suprerinduced, vice will be; for <HI>natura non patitur vacuum</HI>: so his Motive to virtue is not onely a <HI>decoro</HI> from the beauty, but a <HI>damno evitato</HI>; for if he give up himself to virtue (and abandon every evil way, and every evil consort; then there will be no vacuity for vanity and vice to portray it self on: that, as proba|bly of old, <HI>Candidates</HI> in any arts had Tables in which they wrote, or on which drew; what they had to say or do, which when all was full, and no room left; those that had no place therein could not be carryed up to the Judges to be approved of and chosen: so from thence does he apply to the Prince the <HI>simile,</HI> beseeching him so to fill up the Virgin-Table of his minde with virtues of all kindes to his Princely compleatnesse; that when the heat and vigour of youth importunes him to release that severity his resolu|tion has virtuously brought him under, he may deny those insinuations admission and acceptance, conside<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing that what's once well done, ought not to be undone: nay, there is a kind of necessity to persist in an inexorablenesse, where to change is to be|come worse, and to retreat the field, to lose it.</P>
<P>For youth is the foundation of ages superstructure, and though it sometimes falls out, that dissolute youths prove stanch ages, yet mostly 'tis otherwaies, since the in|dications of Manhood are conjecturable even from youth, <HI>Iulius Caesar</HI> told the world what he would be man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cuspinian, <HI>in vita ejus.</HI></NOTE> when but a boy, <HI>animum habuit semper ingentia semper infinita expetentem,</HI> and those drowsie inactivities that many have, who do <HI>pl&ugrave;s quiet&egrave;, qu&agrave;m ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ndo, atque movendo proficere,</HI> shew, that to place them in active lives is to make them unhappy and uselesse, so that the great secret of institution is to know the Ge|nius and delight of youth, and to give it prospect and scope that way, not to abate their courage by continual droppings of displeasure, nor to raise their insolence by in|temperate praises, but so to carry a mean in all things, that they may be kept warm, and not put into a flame and feaver of distemper, for <HI>tant&ugrave;m ingenii, quant&ugrave;m irae,</HI> and so to be cooled as not to be chilled and mortified; for if wisdom said, <HI>vellem in ju|vene aliquid amputandum,</HI> and <HI>Politian</HI> foretold of <HI>Peter de Medices,</HI> that he was like to make a wise man, who was so forward a Boy; then there is danger in breaking the spirit of youth by frequent and imprudent discouragements. As barren grounds brings forth nothing good, so over-lusty grounds too much to be good; extreames are the errors which Mediocrity corrects: such a strength of Soyl as enables production kind|ly and plentifully, and no more then does inable so to do, is good in ground. The like proportion of discretion is to be allowed to the Tillage of youth, neither too much severity, or too great liberty, but an even hand is to be exercised here; for hereby not onely the ingenuity will be dexterously fed, and the stomach of it kept quick and unnauseate, but the memory will also remain unbroken; and that being the <HI>sine qua non</HI> to all learning, <HI>Quintilian</HI> allowes a youth onely capable of so much ingenuity to learn, as he has memory to retain; because it is the Christal Glasse, which has in it lifes, yea arts <HI>Elixar,</HI> set that over too great a flame, and the Glasse breaks and the <HI>E|lixar</HI> is lost: burthen a youths memory with immense cares and manifold studies tran|scending his proportion, and he is ruined by an immemorativenesse: and again, whol|ly disuse memory, and it will shrivel up into a narrownesse and incapacity; the right use of memory is moderately to exercise it, for action perfits habits as food and moti|on increase life and all the concomitants of it; yea and this prudence will exercise it self towards youth in a right disposing of it to delights, and a real principling of it against ill manners,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alexand. <HI>ab</HI> A|lexand. <HI>l.</HI> 2. <HI>c.</HI> 25.</NOTE> and ill Maxims. <HI>Timotheus</HI> the Musician would have a double reward from those Scholars, whom he took to teach from other Masters, with whom they were en|tred; and his reason was, because he had a double labour with them, <HI>dedocendi, do|cendi,</HI> unlea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ning them what they had been ill taught, and then teaching them what was better: and true it is, that he that will be a good Tutor to youth, must imitate both the plastique Artist and the Carver, add and substract as he sees occasion, as they

So in the next words it follows:
<Q><P>Quis artifex tam negligens profectus suae prolis est, ut non eam dum pubescit artibus instruat, quibus poste&acirc; vitae solatia nanciscatur, sic lignarius faber secare de labro, Ferrarius ferire malleo filium instruit, &amp; quem in spiritualibus ministrare <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">upit, literis imbui facit, sic &amp; Princeps filium' suum qui p&ograve;st eum populum regulabit, le|gibus instrui dum minor est, convenit.</P></Q></P>
<P>Here the Chancellour tells the Prince, that the zeal that he has to his understand|ing of, and delight in the Law as the rule of <HI>English</HI> Justice, arises from that principle of paternal sagacity, which age and experience has brought to perfection in him, and his duty to <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, his Liege Lord, and the Prince's Father, (now either in pri|son, or made away, could not in regard of the troubles of his life, and the absence of the Prince from him disenable him to) commanded from him. For though it be true, that young Princes, probable Heirs to Crowns, are in reputation above all other per|sons; yet may they want helps of instruction from their inferiours in station, who be|ing zealous for their good, may not be rude and uncourtly, in communicating their counsels to them, in words pregnant, and with reasons solid. Nor will any but <HI>Reho|boam's</HI> despise it, since whatever love offers, is not to be reproached, though discretion may not accept it at the rate it is offered. If our Lord commended the Widows Mite cast into the Treasury, because she gave it freely according to the penury of her con|dition; surely any address that good will makes, is to be received with kindness, espe|cially when it comes a <HI>digno,</HI> and <HI>dign&egrave;,</HI> when the Chancellour, a Father in years, presents to the Prince, as a youth of Majesty, his humble and hearty counsel; yea, in|deed not to be concerned in the education and principling of this Prince, according to Honour, Law, and Justice, had been an offence against, and a breach of all the Laws of Charity and gratitude, which called the Chancellour forth to a more then usual mani|festation of himself; that by producing a proportionation of care and zeal in Parents, <HI>qu&acirc;</HI> such to their Children, he might convince the Prince, that what other disci|pline to meaner mens Children is, that, the Justice of Law known, is to a Prince, who without it, will be to seek of one of the Flowers, and choicest Jewel of his Crown.</P>
<P>As therefore it is the care of worthy Parents to provide for their Children, fortunes to live splendidly upon, if God please to succeed them in that just and commendable solici|tousness; so is it no less their study, to instruct them in such Arts, Callings, and courses of life, as renders honest industry, and convenient support and reward. And this the very reason of nature, in the lowest impartment of it, teaches Parents to do to their Chil|dren;
<PB N="113" REF="68">
for besides that Brutes do teach their young how to forrage, prowl, and provide for themselves according to the nature of their kind. The most rude, as well as know|ing of men do train up their Children in Callings, that they may know how to live ano|ther day, as the Proverb is. The Carpenter he accustoms his Child to cut with an Ax, and a Saw; the Smith to beat with the hammer; and if a Child prove, as that brave Butchers Son of <HI>Ipswich</HI> did Cardinal <HI>Woolsey,</HI> so spriteful and eager after Learning, so zealous in Religion, that a Clerk, or a Church-man he must be; then all that the Fa|ther can wrap and wring shall be expended in Schooling, and all this that youth may be sitted to the purpose his <HI>genius</HI> directs him to, and best furnishes him for performance of; so does it become Princes to express a proportionable care of their Sons educati|ons, as their proof is of greater consequence for good or evil: nay, there is no such a <HI>convenit,</HI> that a common Parent should be intent on his Child, to provide him good breeding and a Calling on which he may live comfortably, as for a Prince, because his influence being general, the care of him, in order to a general good, concerns the ge|nerality, whom his not being virtuous, endangers to be in no degree happy. The King|dom of <HI>Macedon</HI> was lost by the covetousness of <HI>Perseus</HI> the King of it. The Treason of one <HI>Count Iulian</HI> was the cause that the <HI>Moors</HI> conquered <HI>Spain,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plutarch <HI>in</HI> P. Aemilio. Tolet. <HI>l</HI> 5. <HI>c.</HI> 14.

The temerity of <HI>Consul Varro,</HI> in giving battle to <HI>Hannibal,</HI> was the loss of the <HI>Romanes</HI> at <HI>Canna.</HI> These, and such like evils, are produced by the defects of men in place, and therefore great care is to be used in their education and conduct, that they appear in their actions compleat to the extent of their quality, and the proportion of their influence. To promote which, in a more then ordinary mea|sure, the Chancellour presents Justice, resident in the <HI>English</HI> Law, as the aptest aidant of him, and the thriftiest enterprize he can set upon; yea, because the pliancy of youth gives advantage to the perfection of acquirements, and fixes attained habits in an unal|teredness to their age, he perswades him to accept of serious and virtuous institution in his youth, and to believe that the Laws of <HI>England</HI> are the best study he can engage in, because they are not onely the effects of reason experienced and methodized, but the pe|culiar Rule of right Government, and Religious Order; the learning of which will be most facilitated, by beginning early, and persisting earnestly in the love and study of it from ones youth; which the Chancellour inculcates on him the rather, because he sees the inconveniencies that want of Justice in the minds of Princes, brings on them and their Subjects, making them not meditative of their respective duties, but vigilant to over-reach and afflict each other: which evil spirit, so contrary to God's institution, and approbation, he beseeches him to abhor and discredit, by being the example of a just Monarch, who by a religious and righteous Reign over Subjects, conjures them to a subjection suitable to his Government: and this, if he does, he will not onely be a Son of his incomparable Father <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, but of his Heavenly Father <HI>GOD,</HI> whose place he in reigning bears.

<P>THis Chapter represents the Prince, as sweetly and gratefully recoyling upon the Chancellour, whom he not onely confesses potently oratorious, but sweetly a Vi|ctor of his Reason, into a resignation of practice to his Precept; so mild so ductile was our Prince, that though it was not <HI>Iob</HI>'s hand-maid, whose counsel he desp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sed not, yet in that he was so observant of the wise advice of his inferiour, it argued him not onely not evil, like him the Prophet mentions, <HI>who hated him that reproved in the gate,</HI> but

very good, whom sober suasion, and affectionate tenderness did so effectually move, which is not ever the issue of good counsel given, to be kindly taken, and exactly fol|lowed.

<P>And justly such, for he was no <HI>Rufus Egnatius,</HI> more a Ruffian then a Long-robe|man, but one singled out to this service, <HI>Egregius, quasi ex toto grege electus,</HI> saith <HI>Fe|stus</HI>; one, not to be pared in his age, nor to be fellowed for loyalty, not like <HI>Nazi|anzens</HI> Country of <HI>Ozizala,</HI> abounding in flowers but barren of Corn, that is a man of shew and talk, but of no sincerity and truth of wisdom; no such man was our Chan|cellour, but a Sage of incomparable honour, piety and ability, whom no advantage would buy off from Loyalty, and such he being, good reason he should be accounted, as indeed he was <HI>vir Egregius</HI>; yea, and without dishonour might his Soveraign son say to him, <HI>vicisti me suavissim&acirc; or atione tu&acirc;</HI>; for surely whatever his judgement di|ctated fit, his love put him to promote to his Princes improvement; no unprincely narrownesse did he principle him in, or counsel him to follow; though undoubtedly he had <HI>Metrodorusses</HI> enough to solicite him to accept of treachery to a good end: for his brave soul, like that of <HI>Sextus Pompeius, disdained to gain great things by indirect means</HI>; and thus he serving his Prince, could not but be acceptable to him, and the onely man of influence on him; yea happy in some sort beyond the usual propor|tion of superlutive meriters; for least he should have enter commoned with them in the misfortunes that the brave old Marshal <HI>Memorancy</HI> (had by a remove from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ourt, and Mounsienr <HI>de Vins</HI> notwithstanding his receiving a Bullet at the Siege of <HI>Rochel</HI> into his body to save King <HI>Henry the third,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">D Avila <HI>p.</HI> 25. <HI>p.</HI> 507.</NOTE> to his grief found true, according to the saying of <HI>Lewis the ninth</HI> of <HI>France,</HI>

<P>By this it should seem, the Chancellour baited his hookes to catch the Prince by very subtilly like a Master of the Assembly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eras.

<P>THis our Chancellour begins his Reply to the Prince, that he may appear to him re|solved, to give his scruples a fit and full satisfaction. The Law indeed, the Prince very much seemed to approve, and the study of it to acknowledge convenient, and in a sort necessary for a Prince; but that which he doubted of, was his possibility to attain it to any competent degree, in some convenient time; as also which of the Laws he should adhere to as his choice, to study and govern by. To both these our Text-Ma|ster gives solution in this Chapter, and that by such a breadth and depth of foundation, as will carry currantly all his superstructure. To explicate which his design, he brings in what he has to write with this Position of <HI>Aristotels, That every thing is then said to

De Causis rerum, <HI>c.</HI> 1. <HI>vol.</HI> 1. <HI>p.</HI> 283.</NOTE> particles, and small beginnings of them, and the advances they being (blessed by God) make to after grandeur. Which <HI>Philosophers,</HI> as wise search|ers after nature and reason, do therefore busie themselves in, because they find the ascent to a close view, and accurate prospect of them attainable onely by these degrees of mo|tion from the Centre, <HI>God and Nature,</HI> to the Circumference, effects of them. Three words then here are proposed to couch the gradations of knowledge under; <HI>the causes, principles, elements of things:</HI> which the Commentator, probably <HI>Averroes,</HI> thus ex|plains, <HI>Per principia intellexit causas efficientes,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>By the principles, he understands the causes efficient; by the causes, the causes final; by the Elements, matter and form.</HI> Thus that Commentator.

<P>The principle of every thing some say is the nature, rather then the matter of it; so says the <HI>Philosopher,</HI> for he makes it somewhat above what is gross; therefore he says, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>that from which any thing moves, is called the principle of it</HI>; and <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>this is common to all beginnings to be first in order of time, existence and influence.</HI> Hence is it, that <HI>Philosophers</HI> call these principles efficient causes, because they are the Parents of all increase, and the products of all existence; for whatever is, is, what it is, by force and actuation of its principle, God the first cause, and his bene|diction on the specifique nature, to which it appertains, and is principle. Thus the prin|ciple of all Being is in God, and the delegation of it from him to every created form and species under him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gassendus <HI>lib.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> De causa effici|ente rerum, <HI>c.</HI> 2. <HI>c.</HI> 5. <HI>c.</HI> 7.</NOTE> And therefore that passage of the Apostle, <HI>In him we live, and move, and have our being,</HI> is exegetical of our dependance on God, as our supream and sovereign principle.

For causes have order in their operation, because the end is the reason of the agent, as the Schools say, and thereupon because acts declare ends; (for knowledge is not <HI>secundum quod est in po|tentia, sed quod est in actu</HI>) we are onely made knowing by the perception of cau|ses in their actings, which we call effects, or the ends of their regency over, and energy in things. And thus God being the cause of the cause, is cause of the thing caused, be|cause he gave to such causes power in subserviency to him the chief, and what the un|der causes does, the upper cause is entitled to, either as effecting, or permitting. For though reason be the order of procession from the cause, yet the cause is the impulse producing the act: And hence is it, that some learned men have derived <HI>causae</HI> from <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>ardor</HI> and <HI>incendium</HI> because men are inflamed and set on fire with desire to do, as if they could do no other, but do what they do.</P>

Thus knowledge is perfected by understanding the principle, whence all things arose, God's power, goodness, wisdom, manifested in natures order and efficacy. The Causes final, or end, wherefore God reduced them to the position they are in, and has given them a Law which they cannot disobey without Rebellion and Apostacy, that is, his glory and praise, for which they are, and were all created.

These Lawes thus formed and emanating are the third Basis of our Lawes, and indeed the most probable Engine of our rectification imaginable, since by this blessed act of wise and worthy Legislation, Lawes in cases omitted may be made, in cases dubious explained, in cases obsolete be vacated, in cases hard be indulged; in all cases be accomodated to God's glory, the King's honour, and safety, the Peers lustre and dignity, the peoples peace and prospe|rity. But because, of this I should have occasion to write in the notes on the 18. Chap. Ile desist further proceedure on them here.</P>
<P>Onely in that the Chancellour says, all the Laws of <HI>England</HI> do proceed from these as their Elements, and constituent parts, there is a good Argument to admire the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> as most useful in, and most just for the Government of the people. For since the wisdom of God in the Law of Nature, the Customs of People in the common consent of the Nation, the divine soul and sentence of the King assisted with his Peers, reverend Prelates, and renowned Lay-Lords, (men in whose Counsel, there is science, seriousness, and security.) Since these, I say, do all co-operate in maintaining the Laws in this their Triangularity, there is a most undeniable Argument, that the Law of
<PB N="121" REF="72">
<HI>England</HI> is a choice Law, extracted from, composed of the quintessence of all Laws, and suitable to all gubernative purposes, and in no sort defective to the carrying on of piety to God, loyalty to the Prince, and charity to one another. And therefore, though the Rules and forms of Law, are the marrow of the knowledge of it, yet are the letters of which the words, and the words which make the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ense of Law, as of all other Learning, to be well understood by the Student, since they are as the elements of compound bodies, the grounds and inchoat ducts to the more consequential parts. 'Tis true, as in the body, the eye, brain, heart, face, as the most conspicuous and useful parts, are first honoured, yet cannot the body subsist, nor the anatomist exactly read of the structure of it, without knowledge of the less useful and honourable parts, and conside|ration of them in their respective position and use: so in Arts and Sciences, as this of the Law, without elementary knowledge, all other is unattainable, not possible to subsist: therefore the Text says, <HI>Et ut ex literis, quae etiam elementa appelantur, sunt omnia quae leguntur.</HI> What Attomes are to the Earth, Drops to the Ocean, Rays to the Sun, Sparkles to the Center of fire, that are Letters to Science. Nature works gradually, and her increment is by progression from little to more, and from more to most of her capacity. And hence is it, that as Painters that are Masters in Picture, have Pensils of all sizes and colours, intense and remiss, in the equality of whose mix|ture, the vigour of colours, mediocrities of shades consist: so is there in the Rule of Nature such a Lesson taught us, as first to inure our minds to the smaller and less bur|thensome things of Science, Letters, before we approach those that are ingenerated by their introduction: Principles must, in this sense, follow Elements, as words do suc|ceed Letters.</P>

<P>The Chancellour pretermits no Animadversion that may adorn the Law, and make it venust and taking, for though it has its Pendants and knots of Elements, which trick and adorn onely, yet has it also the more elaborate and becoming parts of lovelyness and feature, which are so necessary to its operation, and rational acceptance, that without them it would not evidence so just and ingenuous a merit. Now these he calls <HI>Maxims,</HI> which carries a sense of grandeur in it, as intending to dignifie the things understood by it with a note of transcendency. These <HI>Maxims</HI> are the <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>the depths, and restorative quintessences of Law</HI>; that from whence all inferiour things have their invigoration and spiriting. Thus the <HI>Lawyers,</HI> as the <HI>Mathematicians</HI> in their Art call <HI>Maxims,</HI> such notions as are the best in their kind, and productive of many excellentillations from them, and that from the authority of Antiquity, which not onely termed God the Architect of the Universe, <HI>Maximus,</HI> but all things superlative in their kind by this Title.

<Q><P>Ipsa rever&acirc; non argumentorum vi ant demonstrationibus logicis dignoscuntur, sed, ut se|cundo Posteriorum docetur, inductions, vi&acirc; sensus, &amp; memoriae adipiseuntur.</P></Q>
<P>In these words, the Text-Master shews the nature of principles transcending grosse|ness of sense, and therefore not to be examined by, and calculated exactly according to it. For as in matters of Faith, there is no reduction of it to the narrow limits of humane bruitishness, but the Rule of belief is the perswasion of the truth believed, &amp; the recum|bency of the believer on God, who is truth it self, in the assertion of that which from him mans understanding is informed of, and affections sharpned on to believe: So in Maxims and Principles of Science, there is no pre-existency to be imagined to them in the art; but all that is knowable, is emanation from them, and the majesty and reason of their conclusion and positivity, which is the reason that the Philosopher allows no disputer to deny a principle; for that done, undoes all that is subsequent, and takes away the very being of Argumentation. For how can any Artist advance an Argu|ment in any Art beyond the first discoveries of that Art? And how can any demonstra|tion be made beyond the line of discovery, and demonstrability? For the Rule and Principle being the <HI>ultra auod non,</HI> beyond that there is no discourse or discovery. Let then Principles remain Mysteries, not to be dived into, but adored, because of their coparcenry with Divinity, and let the senses and memory of man content it self with such attainments, as are conceded them by God, in the right improvement of Nature, and the religious use of her indulgencies. And as no man can define light, as it is in its principle, because it is like God, indiscribable, being a Ray from his essential glory: so can no wise man properly and wisely determine principles by any common notion, or rational apprehension of them. For though they are, and are declared to be what they are by their effects, yet are they hidden, and cryptically reserved by God from the ple|nary discovery of our senses, that we by them unknown, might be kept humble and dependant on his Omniscience, which onely has access to all things, or rather, from whose brightness all natural things are illuminated: And this being, as I humbly conceive, the true apprehension of Principles according to the here alleadged authorities of the Phylosopher, <HI>primo Physic.</HI> and <HI>Topic,</HI> his inference is rational.</P>
<Q><P>Igitur Principiis imbuendi sunt, quiqui gliscunt aliquas intelligere facultates, ex eis etenim revelantuar causae finales, ad quas rationis ducta per principioram agnitio|nem pervenitur.</P></Q>
<P>That is, as no man can regularly build without square and line, which do measure pro|portion, and keep the symetry inviolate; and no man can war, except he have knowledge of, and care to adhere to the principles of Conduct and Battle; so no man can under|stand Science, unless he allows Principles, and conform his notions to the Canon of them. For his end in study and disquisition, being to attain knowledge in, and mastery over the difficulties of the Art, and so subjugate them to his understanding, and to accomplish himself by helps of them, there is a necessity (miracle not being taken in) that Reason operating, by the Principles yielded to, can onely bring him, and his end together. For Principles are the advances, to the end knowledge; they are the single numbers, by which the numerals of Art are made up; they are the <HI>guttulae,</HI> which in their Musters, and Rendevouzes, amount to a Sea of Art. And those that contemn these steps of ascent, will never mount the Throne of Science. Take away the knowledge of these, and Arts will be under as great an Eclipse as the Earth would be, when the Sun were routed the Firmament: dispute these, and deny them to be their own testimony: we shall be all <HI>Sceptiques,</HI> and seekers after what we know not, nor shall ever find: and as he that builds without a foundation, will be but a foolish builder; so he that studies, without acquainting himself with these <HI>fundamental universals,</HI> shall bring his study to
<PB N="123" REF="73">
a vain issue, and prove ridiculous; for as by the pregnancy of the soul, the <HI>faetus</HI> is fo|mented and invigorated to birth, and from the life thence commenced, takes augmen|tation by the nourishment of its Mother; so Art is quickned by the principles of obser|vation and experience, which imbibed, render the means study (next under God) able to produce something towards perfection of knowledg. And as where there is not a hailness of constitution, &amp; the body is not prepared by the <HI>common good</HI> habits of health, to nou|rish the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mbrio</HI> to quickning, and after to assist it in birth, no compleat vigorous Infant comes forth, but rather a Chix, or a lump of flesh and blood, appearing articulately per|fect, but not compleat, as to the integrals of internal soundness; So where there is an unsavouriness of Conception, and the mind, by being vitiated by ill prepossessions, ca|vils at, and is carryed with a leaven against old Rules and Maxims received, there the greater pains is taken, to know the further perplexity, and mental fury is contracted, and men grow rather averse and obstinate, tetrical and opinionative, then sober, civil, use|ful, and learned. For true knowledge begins first at our selves, <GAP DESC="foreign">, and pro|ceeds to know others <HI>aright,</HI> by valuing their virtues, and pittying their infirmities, then it comes to view in the glasse of a pure speculation, what it may possibly, ought ra|tionally, and doth effectually know; and because it finds its knowledge, is but as a point in the latitude of the Universe, it more endeavours to search, then boasts of attain|ment.</P>
<P>And hence it comes to pass, that the great <HI>boasters</HI> are not the great <HI>gainers,</HI> nor are men of singular ways and expressions, always of soundest judgment, and sincerest hearts: For as Creatures that are of wild &amp; ravenous nature, affect devious paths and avoid the ways of conversation; so men of design, to be tragical, and ruinous to any cause or profession, forsake the old way, the good way, and in just return, are often forsaken; for as the truth makes men free, so errour leaves them in bondage. And therefore the old Chan|cellour has drawn herein to the life the portraicture of a good Artist, while he presents him <HI>oculo ad calum, manu ad clavum,</HI> calling on God for a blessing, and expecting it from him, while he keeps in his way. God has an especial favour to order, 'tis himself, and what of it is in us, is of him, a drop from his Ocean, a Ray from his Sun, a beam from his light, an emblem of his infinite perfection. And those that go the way of God and Nature, may expect the reward of both. For minds and bodies are so near of kin, that a roving head seldom keeps a healthy man; and none are so apt to lose all that is in this world of value, time and health of body and mind, as those that are inquisitive after more then is fit for them to find, or appointed for them to know. God has confined study to his Rules; and the principles of every Art, are to bound the Artist; for they are necessary to the knowledge of it, <HI>necessitate medii.</HI> Therefore (faith the Chancellour) <HI>Principiis imbuendi sunt,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<Q><P>Ex eis enim revelantur causae finales, ad quas rationis ductu per principiorum agnitio|nem pervenitur.</P></Q>
<P>Now that a <HI>Pythagorean,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, may not bind up the Prince to a rigid confor|mity, and implicite belief, without any conviction of his own reason, which is a kind of Divine Judicatory in him, the Chancellour here shews the necessity of knowing the principles of any Science from this consideration, that they are the Lines of Communi|cation, which reach to the end, center, tendency, and drift of every Profession; for the Rule and Principle is of the heighth and marrow of every Constitution, and the end is the perfection of every thing. Since it is that, for which every thing is; and there|fore because it is to be advanced to with much consideration and resolution, notwith|standing the impediments to proceed, and not to be hindered, the Chancellour adds, <HI>Ad quas rationis ductu per Principiorum agnitionem pervenitur.</HI> For as there can be no mo|tion without life, no augmentation without motion, no sensation without organs of sense; so there can be no apprehension of principles without rational organs: for it is Reason which apprehends and improves every rational Creature, not onely by dire|cting it to what is good, but fore-warning it against what is hurtful. And therefore no man's procedure is lesse or more then his reason; nor his reason other then suitable to the organs prepared for them. For the soul in the formatory of all our Reason, and
<PB N="124" REF="74">
the emanation of it, and the actions of rational Creatures are so far praise-worthy, <GAP DESC="foreign"> as they are directed to a good end, which ever is carryed on by good means.</P>
<Q><P>Vnde his tribus Principiis, causis, &amp; elementis ignoratis, scientia de qua ipsa sunt, pe|nitus ignoratur.</P></Q>
<P>That is, the Science consisting of the knowledge of the efficient cause, the final cause, and the elements. If these be not known in their command, subserviency, and con|gruity each to other, all that is thought to be known is but <HI>Babel,</HI> Rubbish and Mortar to the noble structure of Art, a Chaos of notions or omniformity of fancy, no polish'd or trim fabrique of Learning. For example, In the point of Law, and knowledge of that, the efficient cause of the Law are Governours and People excited by God, out of ends of good to <HI>civil society,</HI> to make Laws by consent, or obey <HI>good Laws</HI> made by com|mand of their Superiors, though against their wills, yet for their good; For Laws are the effects of Power, and have the stamp of Empire before they are owned such. And again, Laws are <HI>in remedium &amp; tutelam,</HI> and therefore are ever acknowledged to be made for good, or at least so apprehended, therefore I term them made for ends of good, and I consent to them, as made by men excited by God: for since Laws are advantageous to good, and hinderances of evil, and man naturally is evil, and inclinable to evil. What he is an efficient of good, must needs be by the over-ruling of the supream cause <HI>God, who is the author of every good and perfect gift,</HI> and who emphatically is called <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>the Law-giver.</HI> For <HI>Kings, Princes, Parliaments,</HI> and all the learning of men and ages, are but feskues in the hands of God to point us to duty; and if he does not sit in the Assembly and Judge among the Gods, Laws will be <HI>ligule non regulae,</HI> Withs to bind the Poor, but not able to hold <HI>Sampson</HI>'s, whereas Laws ought to be <HI>regulae ad omnes.</HI></P>
<P>Then the <HI>causae finales</HI> of Law are Order, Justice, Concord, Peace. These were in the mind of God, when he thought upon making man, and politizing the World; and these he works in the hearts of men in place and power, to propagate and effect, as they have opportunity. And therefore the Student of the Law must endeavour to know what Justice is, and how it respects not onely the peace of his own soul, but of the whole Nation, and how it has regard also to for reign correspondency. For <HI>Iustice is indeed all virtue.</HI> Hence was it that <HI>Athenaes</HI> tells us, that Antiquity represented Justice to have,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deipnos. <HI>lib.</HI> 12. <HI>p.</HI> 547.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp;c. <HI>a golden face, and golden eyes, tokens of amability, and purity</HI>; yea, the first Altars they erected were to <HI>Iustice,</HI> as the diety subsidiary of all. And he that is deservedly an <HI>Aristides</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, may well be prayed for, that his Children may be numerous, and that they may in Justice be like their Father; since <HI>Iustice</HI> is like the Cement, which keeps the parts of the structure together under the common bond of union; and by such connexion, prevents scissure and fraction, which in time, effects dissolution. And therefore as Divines that preach sanctity of life, and likeness to God, that call on the people to be mortified, and to be subject for Conscience, should themselves, of all others, be most holy, most pure, presidents of piety and patience to others; not heady, high-minded, effeminate, disturbers of order because they have daily Lectures of preciseness herein from the severity of their pro|fession, and the effect it should have on their own lives: so of all men none should be so averse to injury, so free from strife, so gentle in bearing with the follies of the <HI>plebs.</HI> so resolute to propagate order, honour, and learning, as men of Law. For their profes|sion is <HI>jus dicere &amp; docere,</HI> Right is the <HI>genius</HI> of their study; and to prevent wrong, ought to be their practice. Since the end of Laws, is to keep men in government by the contexture of Law, and the distribution of Justice according to it; and they who pro|fess the Law, and use it onely as a decoy, to call fortune to them, by over-reaching weak men, and suppressing right by power of argument and favour, are Lawyers <HI>per Anti|phrasin,</HI> as <HI>Richard</HI> the third was Heir to his Nephews, of whom the Bishop of <HI>Carlile</HI> said, he was <HI>malus haeres,</HI> they are possessours of the name, but not virtues of those pri|stine Lawyers, <HI>Pomponius, Cajus, Aquilius, Servius, Papinianus, Bracton, Glanvil, Littleton, Gascoyn,</HI> and others since, who were not temptable to injury, neither by fa|vour nor frown.</P>
<Q><PB N="125" REF="74">
<P>Vnde his tribus, videlicet principiis, causis, &amp; elementis ignoratis: scientia de qua ipsa sunt, penit&ugrave;s ignoratur.</P></Q>
<P>That is the <HI>media</HI> and passes to perfections being obstructed, or rather not made; there is no possibility of the perfection to be attained which they are ducts and con|voyes to; as without eyes and eares man can see or hear no Letters, without reason not judge, without Memory not retain, so without consistency and sobriety, not submit to Principles, and be ruled and swayed by them; the want of which rational passivity causes all the pedantry and scepticism that is in the world. I or though it be a brave daringnesse of reason to consider and search into things, and perfection, as it is attainable by man, is thus advanced to, yet is there danger in too far ventures, to be immerged and in the depth of new discoveries to lose all footing of pristine science; for laxation of Principle once assaulting new Discoverers, brings them to such a levity and itch of Progresse, that they acquiesce in nothing but uncertainty, and grow un|natural to the pristine Principle of their fixation, which if they would as to the main adhear to, would encourage them to many rational advances, by which from the con|cluded root and maxime of art, many notable slips of science might be attained, which would make a pleasant shew in the knots and borders of arts implantation: tho I well know it's a very hard matter to form with nobly ingenious <HI>des Cartes</HI> a new Philosophy, and not with his transcendent Genius to resolve to do it by a declension of all former preconceptions, and a pleasure to unlearn whatever he has afore learned. Thus as the civil Law accounts a house or ship, that has been so much and so often mended, <HI>ut nihil ex pristina materia supersit,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tit.

<P>For since all the knowledge and discovery our nature can make, is but confused and dark, by effects to know the causes, so far as they explicate themselves, and are served by proper instruments. As it becomes the reasonable soul of man to actuate it self pro|portionably to the Divinity of its constitution, so does it also import it to keep close to truth, and to be conducted by sobriety to the search and service of truth, least while it peepes into the secrets of God to see what there is, (which it ought onely to admire, contenting it self with what God has revealed as its boundary) it fall into a phrensy and raving in which it loses its self, and gives too just cause to censure, that not desire to know, as knowledg is the Image of God, and in the rectitude and sanctity of it is use|full to man to inform him of his duty to God, his neighbour and himself, was the Mo|tive to disquisition, and the unctious liquour that fed the Lamp of its persistency, but pride and sacrilegious ambition to exceed others, and thereupon to brave with, and boast against them: that I say these were sinister proposes of their minds, which kept them in this fruitlesse toyl. But it followes,
<Q><P>Sic Legem divinam nos n&ocirc;sse judicamus, dum fidem, charitatem, &amp; spem, sacramen|ta quoque Ecclesiae, ac Dei mandata nos intelligere sentiamus, cetera Theologiae my|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eria Ecclesiae praesidentibus relinquentes.</P></Q></P>
<P>This is added to shew, that all men in the Church called Christians, as they have not alike in place and office, so have not like endowments, nor ought necessarily to be alike knowing and scientifique. All men without doubt that believe there is a God, and are baptized into the name of <HI>Christ,</HI> and have resigned up themselves by Baptis|mal vow to be God's, in knowing his will that they may do it, and deny all ungodly|nesse contrary to, and inconsistent with it.

<P>This is subjoyned, to teach us, that there are many things in knowledge appendicious, and exploratory of compleatness, which are not fundamental, and requisite absolutely to make us secure from the wrath to come.

<P><HI>Etymologia,</HI>] As Orthography marshals Letters into words, so Etymologie pre|sents the true Notion or Notation of Letters in their word: the Latins call it <HI>Verilo|quium, Qu&ograve; verborum explicatio probatur,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Etymology the Greeks call the Expli|cation or the reason, why things are called so as they are</HI>: after him, <HI>Quintilian</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg">1.

<P>The third part of Grammar is <HI>Syntax,</HI> the Concord and Regimental Order of parts of speech, whereby they are made to coincide, and mix together in the harmony of propriety and exactnesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grantus <HI>in Gr.

<P>Still the Chancellour proceeds to animate the Prince in his persuit of the Law by the example of successe in elementary learning, for as in Grammar a man may attain e|nough to be termed a Grammarian, though as I said before, he be none of the first three, so in the Law a man may have credit of Proficiency, though he be none of the profound ones. Indeed to be exact a <HI>Papinian,</HI> a <HI>Pomponius,</HI> a <HI>Plowden,</HI> a <HI>Dyer</HI> requires a whole man in his best expence of time, and with the best of Divine blessings on his reading and rumination; and that no man can reasonably have ambition to attain to, or greive in falling short off, but he that by length of time, eagernesse of study, strength of memory, sharpnesse of conception, approaches it: but to be entred into and have a superficial knowledge of the Law by which the Student (suppose the Prince) may have (as I said before) insight in the language and common Notions of it, will give the Prince as great a title to the praise of the knowledge of the Lawes of his government, as he shall need to have; and in having them will abundantly finde himself accompli|shed;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Selden <HI>notes on</HI> Fortescue, <HI>p.</HI> 20. <HI>K</HI> James <HI>speech</HI> Whitehall, 1607. <HI>p.</HI> 513. <HI>Of his works in</HI> folio.</NOTE> <HI>For as they are the best Lawes for any place, that most suit with the disposition of the State and Manners of the people that there live,</HI> so is it the best knowledg that a Prince can acquire, to know Gods mercy and indulgence to him in the Method and Prescripts of the Topique Lawes of which h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is Guardian, and according to which his prudence and piety makes him conformable; the degrees of which knowledge are not necessary to the latitude of the Continent, but to such Ascents as are in order to Regal Enablement.</P>

<P>This the Chancellour expresses, to take of all doubt in the Prince, of more expe|cted from him, then is probable for him to attain to with convenient industry: For though he press upon the Prince love to, and skill in the Law; yet 'tis not such a skill as is irksome to get, or takes up all his time to arrive at; 'tis not <HI>Sacramenta legis ri|mare,</HI> but 'tis to know what is common and introductional to knowledge of use, and credit of conversation. For though necessary it be to know <HI>Legis Sacramenta,</HI> the all that is to be known of the Law, the rise, reason progresse, variation, policy, and in|terest of the Law, and what in all these Notions is couched, and how these have bene|ficial operations on the mindes of those that know them, to inable them to every scien|tifique and practique purpose, yet is this not fit for Princes so far to engage them, least it take up their thoughts too strictly, and possesse them too fully to give way for other regal Offices to be thought upon and beloved by them.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ipse jus dixit assi|du&egrave;; &amp; dixit au|tem jus non modo summa diligentia, sed &amp; lenitate</HI> Sueton. <HI>de</HI> Octa|viano Aug <HI>c.</HI> 33.

<P>This inference is very proper from the premised matter: for since the <HI>King</HI>'s of <HI>England</HI> are furnished with learned Judges, Serjeants, Apprentices, and other men of learning in the Law, whose life is spent in study of the Anatomy of the Law; and since they, how well versed soever in it, or any part of it, are obliged to serve the <HI>King</HI> by their Counsel, and otherwise with such their parts, whereby the <HI>King</HI> is politiquely compleated in all points of his Regal Function. Since these things thus are, they do excuse the <HI>King</HI> from that pains and care to understand the legal distribution of Justice in his person; which, but for these supplements, he must have held himself obliged to: so that now, all the <HI>King</HI> is in this case to do, is, to give his mind to love and comprobate the Law, and in that delightful humour to please himself, such minutes as he can spare from action and pleasure. For though a Serjeant at Law, whose glory and grace it is, <HI>Vt serviendo discat,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Selden</HI>'s Notes on <HI>Forteseue,</HI> fol. 56.</NOTE> <HI>&amp; discendo alios perdiscat,</HI> as men of that degree did at their <HI>Parvise</HI>; of which <HI>Chaucer</HI> speaks,

<P><HI>Sufficienter eruditus</HI> then, must have a soft and sober sense allowed it, for in the lati|tude of the Notion, no mere man, no Prince but <HI>Solomon</HI> ever had sufficient learning in the Laws of Nature and Government; for fince art is long, and the well out of which truth is fetched, very deep, and the life of man, though inched out to the ut|most period of <HI>David</HI>'s computation, be a long time, compared to lesser portions of li|ving; yet in order to Art, and the expatiations of Art to be inquired into in that time: nay, though the whole time should be spent in the one onely study of the Laws, the Stu|dent would notwithstanding be o're-taken, before he were an attainer to his <HI>meta ulti|ma.</HI> For if consideration be had, how many years of life are lost in Childhood, in Youth, in mistake, which we are to rescue our selves from and retrograde, what casu|alties of sickness, necessities of life, pleasure, friends, avocate and steal away time, what treacheri&eacute;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Punctam e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> quod vivimus, &amp; adhuc puncto minus.</HI> Se|nec.

For as in Souldiery, he may be said to be <HI>sufficienter eruditus,</HI> who knows all parts of Souldiery, Horse and Foot, Field and Garrison, the Laws of Command and Obedience, the use of all Machins, the Enemy he is to fight with, the ground he is to fight upon, the forces he is to fight by; and so in other Arts and Mysteries, as I say, an Artist thus able to perform his undertaking, may be said to be <HI>sufficienter eruditus</HI> in it, though he be not an <HI>Hannibal,</HI> a <HI>Porphyrie,</HI> an <HI>Aristotle,</HI> a <HI>Drake:</HI> so he may be a Prince <HI>sufficienter eruditus in legi|bus,</HI> who does know what he himself is, and other under him ought to do according to the Laws of his Government, of which he is the maintainer and defender.

<P>The Fathers appropriate much to industry; Saint <HI>Chrysostome</HI> advises to it, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>that we fall not short of eternal good things,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp;c. <HI>the time of labour is but short, and the reward in rest eternity: the Bee is but a small Bird, but the Parent of all sweetness, she alone brings honey.</HI> So is <HI>Industry,</HI> but a small time to be expressed in, but always to be rewarded in the fruit of it. So true is that of <HI>Democritus,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp;c. <HI>men attain to great and good things onely by industry.</HI> And therefore the <HI>Hebrew</HI> word is <GAP DESC="foreign">, coming from <GAP DESC="foreign">, signifying, <HI>cogitare, computare, ratiocinari,</HI> implyes the intention of the whole man, which <HI>Solomon</HI> calls, <HI>do|ing with all our might,</HI> that is, actuating our reason to design, and seconding it by the subserviency of sense, leaving no stone unturned, to effectuate our projection.

conspicuous, and to be regarded as the wise Builder in <HI>Luke</HI> xiv. 8. who <HI>before he layes the foundation of his structure, sitteth down, and counteth the cost.</HI> The <HI>Hebrews</HI> knowing the consequence of this <HI>Industry,</HI> have according to the variety of its na|ture several words to expresse it by <GAP DESC="foreign">, a word of large extent, pri|marily denoting <HI>riches</HI> and <HI>substance,</HI> but translated by <HI>Industry,</HI> because thereby <HI>riches</HI> and <HI>substance</HI> is gotten. It also signifies <HI>Pecus, Angelus, Nuncius</HI>; because as the <HI>Ea|stern riches</HI> consisted in Cattle, and those nourished to increase by <HI>Industry,</HI> as was re|markable in <HI>Iacob</HI>; and as an Angel is the Guardian of man, and watches over him by God's Command, to keep evil from him; so <HI>Industry</HI> is the probable means to keep the Woolf from the door, to prevent poverty and want, which ever follows <HI>Idleness,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, also is a word for <HI>industry,</HI> and that denotes such a vigilancy, as is that of a Commander, who keeps a Garrison in an Enemies Countrey, he is ever on his charge, diligent to con|sider every useful occurrent, and to improve it, no person, no moment is out of his eye, but his thought is bufied about it, and careful to make it commodious to his purpose. This word is opposed to <GAP DESC="foreign">, or <GAP DESC="foreign">, which signifie <HI>incogitancy,</HI> and <HI>vain levity</HI>; such as the Holy Ghost reproaches in the <HI>Ostritch, Who lays her Eggs in the Sand, and con|siders not the foot of the Traveller may crush them.</HI></P>
<P>The sense then of our Chancellour by <HI>industry,</HI> is to commend such a proportion of time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Basilic. Doron. 2. Book. <HI>p.</HI> 177. Works in <HI>fol.</HI></NOTE> as the Prince can spare from the more important things of his office, to spend in the study of the Law. <HI>As for the study of all liberal Arts and Sciences, I would have you reasonably versed in them, but not preassing to be a</HI> Pass-Master <HI>in any of them, for that can|not but distract you from the points of your Calling.</HI> So wise King <HI>Iames</HI>; which he pro|bably might thus intend, that he in his industry in the study of the Law should aim; first, <HI>scire linguam,</HI> to know the Language of it, that he may understand what he reads; then <HI>scire libros legis,</HI> that he may, by knowing Authours, and culling the most pithy and methodique of them, improve the most he may, the time that he spends in perusing them. Then thirdly, <HI>scire regulas legis,</HI> for they are the Tropiques upon which the Law moves. Then fourthly, <HI>scire rationes legis,</HI> for that's of the form and constitu|tion of it, and declares the mind of the Legislators of it. Fifthly, <HI>scire fines legis,</HI> for the end of the Law, is the motive to, and the merit of the Law: so that when he does think of little time, and little toil, there must be a vigorous and thrifty expence of that little, and that will make it go a great way. For all time is lost, and all travel in study to no purpose, if there be not a close application of the mind to the thing we prosecute; and that once vigorously set a work, carryes all to the desired upshot; not onely lets a man into the secrets and abstrusities of knowledge, so that he knows good and evil, and employs his time and diligence in obtaining the one, and avoiding the other; but it prevails against even the morosity and untractableness of wild Beasts, as <HI>Plutarch</HI> in his excellent Book,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 599. &amp;c. <HI>edit.</HI> Paris. Acts 2.</NOTE> <HI>De solertia animalium,</HI> has made good. Therefore <HI>dummodo ad ejus ap|prehensionem tu animum conferas,</HI> is the indispensable limitation. For though by Mi|racle God can, as he once did, give learning <HI>imbre linguarum</HI> in a moment, without any contribution of mans, previous to the collation of it, as was plain in the case of the Apostles, on whom the spirit descended in <HI>fiery tongues</HI>: yet the ordinary way of God is by those steps and assistances of time and labour, that bring about Conquests in Arts, as stupendious as <HI>Alexanders</HI> in Arms, and that <HI>parvo tempore,</HI> and <HI>parv&acirc; industri&acirc;,</HI> that is, while the searchers into, and after them, are young, and their pains is in the na|ture of expression of a pleasure; that as extraordinary fire, aptly conveyed through meet conducts, intends more to the liquefaction, and rarefication of any thing in a day, then otherwise it would in a longer time; and apt Moulds prepared, and reflexions on Fruits and Plants maturateth them in three or four Moneths, which in the ordinary course of season would be a much longer time in production: so in study, intentness of mind, and earnestness of labour, brings about that in a little time to great perfection, which but for it, would not be so circumacted. For here the Proverb is true, <HI>Faint heart never wins fair Lady.</HI> Time and toil will never bring to the Port of Learning, ex|cept the addition of the Students mind, proceeding from a love of Learning, accompany opportunity and endeavour: love and labour do sweeten each other, and promote their consequent success; it being pleasure, not labour, to follow our loves, though we lose our lives and wits in the chase and pursuit of them, and bury our beings in the

Mine where her Oar lyes even <HI>Archimedes,</HI> and <HI>Eudoxus,</HI> will both lose their lives to illustrate the Art they were enamoured of; and <HI>Aristotle</HI> not think the compiling of his History of Creatures tedious, because he loved to search and know what was to be found and known. O this application of the mind, is that which has all natural potency in it; 'tis the door to all speculation and action: This makes men excellent and gene|ral, because indefatigable in study; the praises of <HI>Miltiades,</HI> the renown of heroick ac|quisitions, rewarded in those that have preceded them, stirs them up to an emulation, which draws off their eyes from sleep, and keeps their hearts musing upon their darling. This is that holy charm, that <HI>Moses</HI> prays God to bestow upon his people, <HI>Psal.</HI> 90.12. <HI>So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom, <GAP DESC="foreign"> ut adducemus cordi sapientiam,</HI> which is <HI>ad verbum,</HI> that we may bring to our heart wisdom, that wisdom and our hearts may be one and the same, the root <GAP DESC="foreign">, in <HI>niphal,</HI> signifies (according to <HI>Rabbi David</HI>) <HI>vaticinari, receptionem &agrave; Deo &amp; sermonem quem jubet Deus ut loquatur,</HI> &amp; then the sense may be, that our hearts may have wisdom, as truly and fully revealed to them, as the Prophets had Visions, and that by considering the nature of our days on Earth, we may fore-tell our future condition, either of weal or woe, and endeavour to <HI>make us friends of this unrighteous Mammon, that when we fail, they may receive us into everlasting habitations.</HI> So that <HI>dummodo ad earum apprehensionem tu animum confer as,</HI> imports a delight in, and an endeavour after the knowledge of the Law: for <HI>animum conferre ad aliquid,</HI> is as much as to ponder on, and steer all ones actions to a thing, to make it the mark we aim at, and the Goal we make to, and the Centre we acquiesce in. This, though the Chancellour did not in the strictness of the notion perswade the Prince to, since he had other employments, which did more imme|diately take him up, the intrigoes of State, and secrets of Policy, the interests of his Crown, and the conducts of Counsels. These being the more weighty matters of Re|gality, and requiring more of the personal intention of the Prince, were in order of concern and prudence, to be the chief and main of his study. Though I say in the severity and heighth of the notion, the Prince is not here pressed <HI>animum conferre ad ea|rum apprehensionem,</HI> yet in such a competent and convenient measure, as he can, and his other affairs will permit, he is, and the more he is, (other things not being negle|cted) the more accomplished is he like to prove; since as <HI>Lucius Crassus,</HI> that great Lawyer said, <HI>Omnia sunt posita ante oculos.</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Every day, and with every man there is good use to be made of the Law</HI>; which may be understood not one|ly as in the bulk and greatness of the Author, containing the Ocean of its variety and learning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cicero Dialog.

<P>To conclude this Head then, I presume our Text-Master well knew what knowledge in the Law was necessary to accomplish the Prince, and that it was acquirable in that small time, and with that pleasurable industry, that a year well and profitably spent therein, may in a good mea|sure perform;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nil est quod perti|nax opera, &amp; dili|gens cara non ex pugnat.</HI> Seneca.</NOTE> and thereupon he says, <HI>Parvo tempore, &amp; parv&acirc; industri&acirc;, Because there is nothing which constant endeavour, and diligent care will not attain and over|come.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Nosco enim ingenii tui perspicacitatem.</L></Q>
<P>Here the Chancellour by a Courtly Concession, tempts the Prince to a rendition of himself to his swasion;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Qui vel</HI> Roscinm <HI>illum histrionum decus, hypocrisi &amp; arte mimica supe|rare etiam possunt.

Indeed, this is the best construction Christian inge|nuity can make of extraordinary mercy; not to abuse it, but to fix it upon the noblest object God, and to be satisfied in no sphear beneath, or besides his glory promoted, and charity to man auxiliated by it. It was undoubtedly a noble Proposal that <HI>Tully</HI>
<PB N="147" REF="85">
made to his mind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Budaeus <HI>in</HI> Pan|dect. <HI>loco prae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t|tato,</HI> p. 17.</NOTE> or rather his mind to him, when he thought, <HI>Iuris civilis disciplinam in artis rationem form&aacute;mque redigere; And that by these steps, the whole body of the Law he would refer to several common heads, then reduce every general head into members, then determine the state, use, and operation of every of them.</HI> Every brave and generous mind should do so by the memorie of the mercies of God considering them in the latitude, as they are effluxions from the soveraign bounty of the Creatour to his Creature and then applying them to his condition, and affecting his soul with the obligation of them, and ex|citing himself there from to a proportionation of every virtue, which God requires to be performed, and when performed, he promises to accept.</P>
<P>Now this being the duty of men endowed with such rare perfections, as ripe wit and ready apprehension, which the Text calls, <HI>ingenii perspicacitatem,</HI> the good Chancellour remembers the Prince in the excellency of the blessing, to perform the requiry of the obligation;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Xenophon, <HI>lib</HI> 20 De Sociat.

For to the amazement of all his Contemporaries, he not onely boldly came in the head of an Army to fight the Usurper; but when he by misfortune of War was a Prisoner, justified his fact to the teeth of his Opposite; which declares, that he had <HI>ingenii perspicacitatem,</HI> and saw that it was his interest above all things, to be in his addiction Martial; and this he accordingly being, is said to be <HI>perspica|cissimi ingenii,</HI> as being a man in wisdom, while a youth in years; yea, a Prince, who had a complication of all the promising excellencies of prudence in him. And this the Chan|cellour thus charactering in him, informs us, that a Gentleman he was above his years: For <HI>perspicax</HI> implyes <HI>Prudence.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Offic.</HI> 142. 2. <HI>Offic.</HI> 132.</NOTE> <HI>Tully</HI> writing of <HI>Palumedes,</HI> says there was in him <HI>perspicax prudentia,</HI> and the <HI>Greeks</HI> calling this by <GAP DESC="foreign">, which <HI>Suidas</HI> expresses by <GAP DESC="foreign">, and intends such an insight into things, as men have who look with not onely both their own eyes, but with all the other mens eyes they can be helped to see through things by. And the Chancellour seeing in the Prince a more then ordina|ry Princely smartness,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Such another was our <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth.</NOTE> (I say Princely, for God ordinarily does qualifie them above others, as he designs them for greater charges then others have) the Chancellour I say, perceiving by the first appearance of the Sun in the Morn, and the early appearance of his life, calls upon him to direct his ripeness to a right object, and by right and proper means, to wit, the Law, which he may sufficiently, to credit himself to men, and to answer comfortably to God, learn knowledge in <HI>parvo tempore &amp; parv&acirc; industri&acirc;</HI>; since as quick and intense fires,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Patriclus Instit.

<P>This is added, to evidence the Chancellours judicious experience of his assertion, and it extends not onely to <HI>noscoingenii perspicacitatem,</HI> but to the whole scope of his words precedent, that he could by God's help, and would by his submission to his Prescription, make him undoubtedly sufficiently learned as a Prince in the Laws of <HI>England, parvo tempore, &amp; parv&acirc; industri&acirc;,</HI> which he limits to one year.

Yet have more brave men and Families been degenerous, and abated the splendour of their Ancestry by their vicious imparities to them, as <HI>Zuinger</HI> in many examples con|firms. And so, though in the Law some may be culled out, that extraordinarily pro|fit, and are for learning, temper, grace, and integrity, fit betimes for Judges, per|haps some time within the space of twenty; yet such are but <HI>rarae aves</HI> (one <HI>Phoenix</HI> per|haps of this kind is in an Age) generally the rule is peremptorily true, that a Judge's Knowledge and Learning is hardly got in twenty years time, if then.</P>
<P>A Judge then therefore is so long attaining his qualifications, because not onely they are many in number, and different in nature, but depend upon some masteries of self, and intuition into the mysteries of things, which are the product of great years, and much wisdom collected from them: while youth is warm, and passion keen, when the apprehension is not fixed, nor experience has corrected the volatility of fancy and humour, there is no room for unmoveableness, and a rectitude equally distant from the extreams.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Non enim aut se|veritatis, aut cle|mentiae gloria est affectanda, sed propenso judicio prout quequae res expostulat, est statuendum.</HI> Hopperus, De ver Jurisprud. p. 22. <HI>Tit.</HI> 15.

<P>Here the Chancellour applyes himself to the Prince by a wise insinuation, adapted to the humour of youth; which being delighted with actions of pleasure and gayety, is frequently kept from other more serious and useful accomplishments, by the prejudices it has, as if they were inconsistent with the other things of recreation, and externity of pomp; which because the Chancellour knew a dangerous anticipation of his counsel, he endeavours to remove by a calm and swaviloquious grant of Recreations, and a com|petency of time to Military Affairs, without any frustration of his sufficient accom|plishment in knowledg of the Laws in the proportion, and within the time aforesaid. And to good purpose does he do it, for had he told him, that the recreation he had chosen, was to have been refused, that learning in the Laws alone could make him good in his person, and good to his Government, had he kept him to the rigid and austere Rule of Study, and not given him some relaxation, and allowed that best spent, in what he most delighted in, and would really find a great ornament to him, <HI>Military Discipline,</HI> he had wholly lost his ear and heart; which done, all the reason he could speak or write, would have been ineffectual, because coming from a Tongue and Pen unfavoured, and therefore suspected; but in that he does so comply with the Prince's youth, and yet follows on his intendment, argues him to be both a man of civility and sageness: For as labour is wearyness to the bones, a punishment of sin, and the waster of life; so is Recreation, and cessation from it a re-invigoration, or second enablement of Nature to bear her burthen.

For as the eye, always intent on reading, will at last be weak, though its composition and visual Organ be never so strong, and the Bow, if always bent, will grow weak, and the Treasure always drawn from, will in time be exhaust; and as shades are made of many colours, which any one colour will not perfect: so is the mind not onely pleased with, but refreshed by variety; and therefore, as wise Physicians prescribe no physick to the body, but such as it will bear, nor no oftner to repeat it, then they find morbid matter adhering, and then the strength and spirits of the Patient will permit, but prescribe intervals by which the body is restored, and the strength in some measure recuperated: so do wise Tutors gratifie their Pupils with such refracti|ons of them from their intentness on study, as may make them come to it fresher, and continue at it willinger, since by them they are made more apprehensive of their read|ing, and more emulous to deserve well, which they are so kindly dealt with. Though then our Chancellour did press vehemently for the Princes training up in the know|ledge of the Law, and that by an intentness of mind for one year, in which he (so in|genious and docile) might be by the Chancellours method taught it; yet did he not desire all that years time to the Law, but allowed him part of it to matters of Arms and Chivalry, part to Devotion and Piety, part to Food and Necessity, and part to Friend|ship and Courtesie; which he I suppose did in a method,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Bencher of <HI>Grays.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AS the first disanimation of the Prince was taken from the perplexity of the Laws study, and the supposed impossibility of conquering it to any tolerable perfecti|on in short time and with moderate study; so the second is, whether Law the Prince shall choose as the subject of his Study, whether the particular, Insular, Municipe Law; which no Nation knows or owns but <HI>England</HI> alone, or the civil Lawes which are the Lawes of the Continent, and to which almost all Nations, and the learned men of them generally subscribe.</P>
<P>This I confesse is a rational seruple, and that which in point of choice, a man of parts and single eye who unengaged seeks truth, and would bottom his actions there|upon, would be diligent to seek, and rejoyce in the obtainment of. For Good being the end of mans desire and action, and it being deposited in the Lawes of God and Nature, whence all active good, that of Prudence and Conduct is extracted: to chuse the best Method of them is the highest Act of Concernment, next the souls affairs, man can be imployed in. This the Perspicacity of the Prince diving into, conveyed such doubts into him, that he could not <HI>jurare in verba Magistri,</HI> and take his Chancel|lour's choice till he had concocted the Arguments he proposed to his Solution, and Satisfaction therein. And truely, if it be considered what <HI>Tully</HI> sayes of the civil Law, <HI>O rem praeslaram vobisque retinendam Iudices,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Apud</HI> Budaeum <HI>in Pandect. priores</HI> p. 23.

For since the Prince had long, and fruitlesly (as he thought) waited God's return, which the heighth of his forward youth would ripen sooner then Omnipotence pleased, since he saw another in his Father's Throne besides himself, and was greedy to contend and evict that which was supposed his right; this considered, I say, may give us shrewd suspicion, that the Grave Chancel|lour saw him impatient, like that ill-advised man in 2 <HI>King.</HI> vi. last verse, <HI>This evil comes from the Lord, why should I waite for the Lord any longer</HI>; and in a hurry and storm of passion meditate to be revenged of the Lawes, the sacredness of which seem|ing

to shrowde his Antagonists possession, made his accession upon him more difficult. This probably the old Chancellour sadly considering, occasioned his Counsel of recol|lection to the Prince, not onely to allay the present servor of his youthful Mettal, but to convince him, that when he had bussled all he can, and fretted his minde into a tempestuous heat, hazzarding all the serenity of his hopes and the comfort of God's Reverter in mercy to him, he could do nothing Princely, but what must and ought to be legal and just: and this he tells him is in the Lawes Case resolved, past doubt or alteration; As a man that is married cannot use his Wise as he please, but according to the Nature of Marriage, and the right of the Privileges thereof; so the King of <HI>Eu|gland</HI> cannot <HI>salvo Sacramento, salvo iure, salv&acirc; Conscienti&acirc;,</HI> change the Lawes of his Government at his pleasure, but does and holds himself obliged to do nothing re|gally, but what legally he may, which he not being able (<HI>salvis his</HI>) to do, the Questi|on is answered in the Negative,, <HI>Non potest Rex Angli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI></P>

<P>This the Chancellour wrote not to assault or lessen the King's power, but to render it by its soft and gentle Edge not onely lesse terrible, but more obliging to the Subjects, towards whom it expresses it self so mercifull; and truly did I not humbly resolve by God's grace assisting me, to be just to truth, and modest to the great power of my dear and dread Soveraign, it would have become me rather to do by this subject, as <HI>Patroclus</HI> did by <HI>Achilles</HI> his Spear,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. <HI>Plu|tarch,</HI> lib. <HI>De Adulat. &amp; amici discri|mine,</HI> p. 59.</NOTE> not meddle with this of any to comment on, because it is so easie to err about it: But as I humbly implore the wisdom of God to direct me to write the words of truth and soberness; so do I in all humble reverence to the Majesty of my Lord the King, beg his pardon and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">avour, that what I write may be esteemed to proceed from a Justice and Loyalty, which aims at nothing but the real explication of the truth herein; to which, since the Text leads me, and a truth there is much to the illustration of the excellency of the Monarchy of this Nation re|ported in it, I will, with all ingenuous modesty, write a few words of it.

For <HI>non potest</HI> does not respect the absolute and strict power of a King, for then who of his Subjects shall dare to withstand his pleasure, and impede his resolutions any more then a Whippit dare ruttle and enrage a Lyon, or a Smelt contend with a Whale. As God over the World, so Kings over their Subjects, have an omnipotence not to be disputed with, but adored by them. If <HI>David</HI> will eat the <HI>shew-bread,</HI> which is onely the viands of the Priests, and take the Wife of <HI>Uriah,</HI> which is the proper treasure of her Husba&nacute;d,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cook 2 Instit.

All these come in to modifie the <HI>non potest,</HI> and to put weight upon it, so as to make it as the Centre of the Earth unmovable.

For though in some times, and upon heats and cholers, there has been somewhat interpreted like a tendency that way; yet has it ever been but an <HI>embrio,</HI> and soon turn'd into ruine of those that advised it.

De Constitutioni|bus Principum.</NOTE>This Sentence cited out of the Civil Law is <HI>Ulpians,</HI> and the application of it is thought to fix the power of absolute Regality, upon whatever is of Subjects for it to take hold of, which perhaps is not the Lawyers meaning, but with some restriction; that Kings do not make Laws upon their own Wills, but as assisted in Council by their learned and sage Counsellours, who advising them what to declare Law, accompany them also in a mild interpretation and execution of it. For so the same Law qualifies the generality of this rule by that <HI>omnia sunt Principis quoad jurisdictionem &amp; protectionem,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Digest. p.</HI> 42. in <HI>gl. ad Prooem.</HI> C.</NOTE> <HI>non quoad proprietatem</HI>; and therefore though in absolute Regalities, where no Laws of modifica|tion are, this rule is made use of to warrant high courses; yet may this have a calmer interpretation in the nature and intendment of it. A Woman is under her husbands plenary power, he may do with her, so he destroy her not, as he please; her person is at his pleasure; her fortune subject to his dispose; her allowance and manner of living solely to the <HI>quantum &amp; quale</HI> of his proportioning them: yet no wise man will hence conclude, that Husbands do, where good, improve this to a Tyranny over, or a vexa|tion or diminution of their Wives; rather wise men know, and worthy wives finde, that from deserving Husbands their Virtues have all the Compensations and Rewards that this Prerogative of the Husband over them can devolve upon them, and though
<PB N="163" REF="93">
the nature of Marriage favour the man, yet the Courtesie and nature of man retorts the fruit and kindness of such favour and prelation on the Wise, because she is willing to obey, she rules, and by resigning to her Husband, has assignation of his right to rule by him all he has and himself too: so in the case of absolute Kingship, though Kings may by the high Sovereignty of their Dignity curb their Subjects, that they dare not deny whatever they ask, or refuse what they command, because God has made their Swords of straw, against their Princes of Steel; and their hands are bound, when their Sove|reigns are loosed, and onely can be bound by God: yet that by virtue of this position, and the sacredness of it, they should so do, is no necessary consequence, though too often true. And truly, we in <HI>England</HI> have cause to sweeten this hard Exposition of this Rule, when we consider our Princes, as true Monarchs as any, and as independent on any but God; yea, as well protected against the insolencies of Subjects, as any Mo|narchs, yet have for the most part been very calm, considerate, and ruleable by the Laws of the Land, and not laid yoakes upon us, but such as either, some of them, have been ill counselled to,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Instit. <HI>p.</HI> 152 on Stat. <HI>W.</HI> 1.</NOTE> or by necessity of affairs put upon, and have remitted, with a kind pro|mise of not so doing hereafter.

Kings may have necessities more then ordinary upon them, and they must have suitable supplyes for them, which if they have by Parliamentary Levies, they have them by undoubted Legality, and the Subject re|pines not against the Prince for it, but owns the Law, which by his own consent has bound him from repining, and to the payment of his proportion towards it. Such a favourable interpretation then being given of this <HI>Quod Principi placuit, legis habet vi|gorem,</HI> it follows, that the rigidness of the general rule may be allayed by a particular instance of goodness. And therfore the Kings of <HI>England</HI> having never made Laws but in Parliament (Courts that they call not only <HI>modestiae ergo antiquam consuetudinem servare,</HI> as a Forreigner falsely writes, as if they signified no more, then to do whatever they were commanded to by the King; so that (in his words) <NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="marg">Thesauro Politico Impress.

<P>Here the Chancellour shews, that where Regalities own no National Laws; yet if they restrain their power and wills, to prize Justice, and gratifie not their passions above general good, and so tyrannize over their Subjects, making their lives grievous them, there also people cannot choose but be happy.

For it is not greatness of power, that betrays men to abuse of it, but their own corruption, which thence takes occasion to vexati|ously exercise it.

So long as there is a noble heart and a vice-less mind, which to gratifie greatness descends not beneath it self, there is no danger: nay so long as Lawes of mitigation, gagg'd by Reli|gion, have onely the force of remembrances to Princes; Subjects are more to pray for good Princes then good Lawes.

<Q><P>De quali Rege dicit Philosophus tertio Politicorum, quod melius est civitatem regi viro optimo qu&agrave;m Lege optim&acirc;.</P></Q>
<P>This Maxim of the Philosopher, is, I suppose to be accounted, true upon Considerati|on of two things. First, That good men were more ancient then good Lawes; for good Laws were invented by good men, instituted by God in Providence to the declension of men from rectitude, as conversation and discovery of the world occasioned their warp: for in Patriarchal times, &amp; in the Innocency of the golden Age, Nations and Continents submitted to one or few in whom they saw most Divinity and Heroiqueness, and from those did they willingly receive the rule of life and all the Prescripts of their publick and private Concern; and when to such Rulers and Law-givers there was no Law but their own wills, no question of their Commands but presently they were obeyed; yet even then did the virtue of these Chiefs and Patrons keep them from Tyranny, and affe|ctation to themselves with injury to the publick. But when once Vice had boyled off the grain Colour of virtue, and there was adoration given by men to the Idols of Pomp, Power and Magnificence; then there was a necessity to limit Encroachments, and to impede Advantages against popular Credulity by politique Sanctions, and to make those accessable to rule, who were most demonstratively just, and had the most gene|rous and open latitude of epidemique Justice in them, which policy made all men of E|mulation Candidates to Gouernment, and those onely sure to have it by publique suffrage, who had the most pure and publique Spirits in them. Secondly, Better good Kings and Rulers then good Lawes, because good Lawes are nothing without good Kings and Rulers that execute them; Alas; the Law is but a dead Letter, 'tis
<PB N="170" REF="97">
the Minister of it that quickens it, without him the best Laws are but like Medicaments in the Apothecary's shop, unavailable to the sick man, who dies notwithstanding them. Indeed as <HI>Demosthenes</HI> said, <GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp;c. <HI>Lawes are the soul of Gover|nments</HI>; but what are souls without bodies in which they move: <HI>Israel</HI> had good Laws in <HI>Ahab</HI>'s, <HI>Rheheboam</HI>'s and other ill Kings times, but the Nation was never the better but the worse for them, because God was more provoked by them, as they were not improved aright under evil Kings, and thereupon all people are to pray earnestly for good Governours, <HI>That under them they may live peaceable lives in all Godliness and Honesty.</HI> For as it is not fire in the hearth that makes warm; nor air in the sky that carryes to the Port; nor light in the Candle that enables to read; nor money in the purse, that feeds man, unless they be adapted to us; and we within the sphear of these, whereby they may properly effect their end upon us: So is it not good Lawes that felicifies a Nation, unless they be made happy by a good Guardian and Defender of them. <HI>Isocrates</HI> calls <HI>Evagor as</HI> such an one, for his Empire was so moderate and just,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isocrat. <HI>in</HI> Eva|gora <HI>apud</HI> Sto|baeum <HI>serm.</HI> 46. p. 329.</NOTE> that all his life time in it he led <GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp;c. <HI>without injury to anyone, honouring the good, ruling over the bad, and punishing evil men onely according to the Lawes</HI>; for such an one will not onely execute good Lawes in being, and suspend the rigour of ill ones, till they can be repealed; but festinate the substitution of good Lawes in room of ill ones, and remove the snare in which Subjects may be harmfully caught; and hence good Kings are called Fathers of their Countries, because as they do <HI>ignoscere delicta,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">, <GAP DESC="foreign">, Arist. <HI>lib.</HI> 5.

<P>This is well subjoyned, to excite the Prince to a just return to God for his favour, in giving him the reputed Title to so fair a Crown, and so flourishing a Law as it was held by. Indeed, every mercy should oblige a man to gratitude, and he is not worthy the Air he breaths in, the Earth he treads on, the meanest indulgence he enter commons with the Creation in, that does not express his gratulation to the fountain of his en|joyment: but Princes that have Crowns put upon their heads, and are to rule by just and wise Laws, have myriads of thanks to return God for their prelation, and ought to be paramount to others, in returns of service suitable to their predignification. And this is the sense of the Texts <HI>Gaude</HI>; not to kindle in the Prince a joviality, arguing le|vity, and youthful froliqueness; but to raise him to a comfortable demeanour under so great an indulgence: so to be affected with the mercy, as to think of King <HI>David</HI>'s <HI>quid retribuam</HI>; for it is a mercy to have a Law; and gracious Princes think it so, that they may testifie, that they fear: if their Wills were the Law, the Law of God and Ju|stice would not command their Wills:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign"> &amp;c.

This, this is matter of joy to a Prince, probable to succeed his Father to it; and that because where all parties concerned, are agreed in their respective stations, to promote the noble ends of this politique Harmony, both peace will be to the Prince in soul and body, and comfort to the subjects in their enjoyment of their good things in peace; which thing, in other words, was notably declared, to the satisfaction of all sides.

could impeach his Regality, no nor could the Moth of time or periodique fatality, which determins Governments and transfers them from one to another, work on his Government, that was from everlasting in the root, and would have been to everlast|ing, not onely in a sense of divine Perennity and essential Indeterminateness over the whole world, as Lord of the Universe, but as to such a proportion as the sense of his temporal exercise over the Jewes was applicable to, over them: but by condescention to their desire, and in punishment to their murmure and machination, which rather aimed to gratifie their curiosity in being like other Nations, then to acquiesce in a gratefull submission to God, and a willing subjection to his Deputies set over them. And the Chancellour not onely sets down their sin in desiring man rather their King, then God, but the Instrument of their Prevalence, and the Engine they imploy, which is Prayer to have their Government passed over to a King of flesh and blood, bone and bulk as themselves, yea and the effect of their desire they begg'd inordinately, and God gave them their hearts desire to their after-terrour. This does the clause set forth, not to depreciate their desire of a King, but to blemish their inordinate Princi|ple in desireing a King in opposition to and declension of God their King; and there|fore God, though he gave them their desires upon their requests, yet he so imbittered his gift, that it should ever carry the memorial of their sin with it. And this shews us both the corruption of nature, which delights in change, and the danger of change by reason of such corruption. Not onely, <HI>Man being in honour abode not,</HI> but in his prevarication became <HI>se ipso humilior,</HI> beneath the beast that perisheth; so that not onely the Principles of which Nature consists being changeable, incline to change, but even the tendency of man in the lubricity of his will inclines to it, and that by a Judge|ment of God on his understanding, that takes evil for good, and is restive in loveing and improving it to his ruine and annihilation. Nor is it ever seen that changes in this Militant State, without great grace from God, are for the better, but most an end for the worse; of all the changes of <HI>Israel</HI> 'tis said, <HI>They changed their glory for shame</HI>: their freedom for bondage, first, to the <HI>Aegyptians</HI>; then to the <HI>Babylonians</HI>; then to the <HI>Romans,</HI> and now to the Turks; and of all personal changes, little can better be said then was in that, That of all the <HI>Caesars, Solus Vespasianus mutatur in melius,</HI> yea when people are fond on change, what products do such incests bring, but ty|ranny and confusion, unless God be in the change by a gracious influence on it, as he was in <HI>David</HI>'s change from a Shepheard to a King; in <HI>Ioseph</HI>'s from a neglected younger Brother to a Father to <HI>Pharoah</HI> and all <HI>Aegypt,</HI> in <HI>Saul</HI>'s change from a Persecutor to an Apostle; in Time's change of <HI>Iulians</HI> for <HI>Constantines.</HI></P>
<P>I say, unless God be the effectual mover of changes, and fortunates them to their blessed and lawful issue, Changes <HI>qu&agrave;</HI> such are dangerous, and when they are gratifi|cations and holocausts to popular levity, become plagues and torments to their promo|ters; who because they are Children in discretion and are led by hurry and eddy are to be resisted in such Attempts, and the rods of severity are by Lawes made for such fools backs. Thus then it came to passe with <HI>Israel,</HI> God was their King, and an|other they would have as the Nations had; the Contumacy of <HI>Isra&euml;l</HI> under God's gentle Empire had provoked him to conclude a punishment for them, and now their corruption gives the occasion to its operation upon them; God gives them their hearts desire, but not to their end but his own, <HI>To be his Punisher of their Perverness</HI>; and thus that which they intended the Display of their Triumphal Banner, and a Trophy of their National Grandeur, becomes their breaking a pieces; so that no Grain of their pertnesse and mettle remained unpounded; broken they were under the Iron Mall of their own designation: and just it was with God, that since Liberty caused Insolence, Oppression should compel Duty, and the Law of God dictating to Duties, moral and religious, being contemned, the will of man contrary to these, even when it commands contrary to these, as a Curse on people, be in place of a Law, and chearful obedience to a lawfull Government being stomach'd at; if not denyed, a lawless smart and severe one should be introduced, for the justice of God punishes sin in the kinde it is committed; because People are voluntarily rebellious against good Princes, God makes them ne|cessarily subject to bad, who trample them and thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s under foot.</P>

<P>THis Chapter is spent in maintenance of the Dialogical Continuity, and it has that spirit of reason in it, which keeps the Chancellour in preparation for an answer of what's therein interrogated; the common Rule is, <HI>ubi cadem ratio idem jus,</HI> and why the politique, mixed with regal Government, since it is a real Kingship, should not have so much Priviledge as its brother Kingship nomore divine, nor no trulyer instituted of God then it is? Is the scruple now to be resolved. For since Regality in both is of, God, the Condescension of it in the one and not in the other is no alteration of the Essential dignity, but an adumbration of it for ends of good; which since God does seem for our sakes often to do, when yet he retains his absolute Soveraignty; why the King so doing should seem less then otherwise he would be, is the question to which the Chancellour frames an answer in the next Chapter.</P>

<P>THis Chapter is the pithy breviary of the Chancellour's Response to the former Chapters Proposals, and it is by way of Concession, that the power of both Kings is the same as his arguments and reasons in the formentioned tract purposely thereupon written, doe make good: all that is of diversity in the powers is not <HI>fundamenti sed exercitii,</HI> not in the nature of the power; for that being God's in the trust of Kings <HI>qu&acirc;</HI> such, is equally God's, and equally in the Dignity and Majesty of it. Theirs; but the emanation or rather modification of it, is diverse upon diverse reasons, which in the twelfth Chapter be enlarges upon. For as there is no general rule but admits of some Exceptions, and the same Sun melts wax that hardens Clay, so the same power and prerogative variously expresses it self in the one and in the other, according to the subjects it is conversant about and the juncture of affairs it has to cope with, which, because the Chancellour has discoursed upon before, and now remembers, <HI>frustr&agrave; fit per plura, quod fieri potest per pauciora,</HI> he in that part referrs to what he had formerly resolved in it, and for what is undiscoursed of, promises additional Information, and that he makes good, not by a bold braving, but a modest veracity, <HI>cujus diversitatis causam, &ugrave;t potero, tibi pandam.</HI></P>

Now though he sayes the greatest Monarchs were but men in na|ture, yet by the stimulations they had to great actions, and the successes they had by them, they appear to be more then men, because stirred up by desire of glory and ho|nour to contemn danger and hazard, which in contest with, and conquest over men their fellowes in nature and station, they must resolve to cope with. Now this so pa|tiently works in the nature of great mindes, that it makes them set upon Nations to Master and Lord it over them, and our Text-Master cals it the rise of great Empires. And if all the Heroiques of the world were asleep, and the memory of them perished; the truth of this would be confirmed from the actions of one onely <HI>Alexander,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">, Plutar|chus <HI>in lib. an Seni sit gerenda Resp. in Notis ad lib.</HI> 3. polit. cor. <HI>c.</HI> 3. <HI>p.</HI> 145.</NOTE> who was not onely the worlds Master before he was thirty years of age, which he did <HI>by Counsel, Eloquence, and the art of Rule and conduct,</HI> but envyed any Commander of his own that was successefull: yea <HI>Lipsius</HI> is my Authour for it, <HI>That he was more wrath with his fortunate and well-deserving Commanders, who did things with merit of glory resulting there from, then with those that executed his Commands, infeli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iter &amp; ignav&egrave;, unpro|sperously and with dishonour,</HI> which perhaps is the reason that ambitious Princes disfa|vour great Merits, least they themselves by them should be lessened, and have Rivals and Competitours in that power, which they would have solely theirs, and which they can attain to by no readyer an Artifice, then reputation of bold and fortunate, which as it was a serviceable Harbinger to designs of rule and Soveraignty, so made Subjects admire the obtainers of it beyond reason, and arrogate to them a participation of Di|vinity; so that men no sooner heard but feared, and no sooner saw but submitted to them, as thinking every frown a thunderbolt,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In Notis ad c.</HI> 6. <HI>lib.</HI> 3.

And thus comes it to pass that <HI>Nimrod, Iulius Caesar,</HI> and the mighty Chieftains of the world have subdued Countryes, wasted Continents, prostrated stately Edifices, rent asunder goodly Libraries, dissipated well compacted Combinations; yea in sort uncreatured the world by the Prodigality of their furies, and the tragicall effects of it; which though God has often turned to good, and most of the good Lawes and good Magistrates that the world and every part of it has seen, be the issue of this original Grandsier Cruelty; yet was the Commencement of it alto|gether roystrous and sauage, and in this <GAP DESC="foreign"> was there no aim at any thing at first, but to Master, and to have all at the Conquerours pleasure, which was the Go|vernment mentioned <HI>Daniel</HI> v. 19. where 'tis said of <HI>Nebuchad-nezzar.

This opinion the World had of <HI>Iulian,</HI> which made him so successful every where; and of <HI>Iulius Caesar</HI>; and all that have been Victors, who have become absolute, by the awe their virtues either Togal or Mar|tial have prevailed by. And this in time has been the Ancestor to all after calmness; for when the stomachs of men have come down, and both the Ruler &amp; ruled have had enough of force and fight; to prevent it for the future, both of them have consented to terms of civil order and quiet, which in time has antiquated and eliminated all fierceness, and brought in credit, mutual kindness and politique consciencious respect and fidelity each to other: for so the Chancellour proceeds,
<Q><P>Quarum perpetione divina subjectus sic populus, dum per subjicientes &agrave; caterorum inju|riis defendebatur, in subjicientum dominium consenserunt.</P></Q></P>
<P>Here the Chancellour shews, that though Conquest possessed the great Monarchs of the World of their Commands; yet consent of the people conquered, recogniz'd and ascertain'd them peaceful to them, and hereditary to their Heirs and Successours; and that not onely upon fear and necessity, because otherwise they could not help themselves, but upon choice, and as we say in Law, a valuable consideration, the Con|querour was to protect them from injuries, and to warrant (with his utmost hazard) their security, against all persons that would annoy them, and they were obliged to be loyal to him, and to live subject-like under him. So that there is hence a reciprocation of advantage; the Governour is secure from treachery and mutiny, the governed from rapine and cruelty: for there is a double rule of the Law that makes to this purpose, <HI>subjectio trahit protectionem,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">. Iuris.</HI></NOTE> &amp; protectio subjectionem,</HI> and <HI>quibus modis aliquid acquiri|tur, iisdem &amp; conservatur.</HI> In both which respects, the joynt concord to so noble and be|neficial ends, appears to be wise and worthy, since security from danger is one of the great blessings of life, and that is not to be purchased but by submission to power, which is able to compel, but is willing to comply, and by adhering to that power, to those pro|fitable issues of peace and order. This is the Golden Chain of power, by the Links of which 'tis made conspicuous, durable and communicative; and this composition being so athletique and virile, so rational and effective of good to all parties indifferently, makes it so beautiful, and so lasting. For as it commenced through the wise project of both sides, conspiring to make each other happy in a respective conjunct fatiation; so it cannot be dissolved, but with the dissolution of all that is lovely and desirable. For as it follows,
<Q><P>Opportunius esse arbitrantes se unius subdi imperio, quam omnium cos infestare volentium oppressicnibus exponi.</P></Q></P>
<P>Indeed here is the marrow and motive of all subjection, 'tis <HI>ration<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> boni inde proveni|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntis.</HI>
<PB N="181" REF="102">
For as God the <HI>Proto-Monarch</HI> is not made happy by the Worlds obedience to him, but the World made happy by his defence and preservation of them, whom as a King he protects; as a Law-giver he directs; as a Father he feeds; as a Husband he tenders; and as a Benefactor he will reward: so Kings (just and worthy) are not more happy in the subjection of their Subjects, then their subjects are in the watchful eye, powerful hand, subtle head, affectionate heart, and every way expressive largeness he discovers towards them: Nor is there any so compendious a way of peace, as for the Subjects readily and freely to submit to their Prince for Conscience sake; yea, and for the goods sake that thence results to them. For when one takes the duty, and ex|pects the subjection, he puts an end therein to all those pretenders, whose injurious spirits flatter them into a right of doing wrong; &amp; whether it be not better to obey one then many; and a King noble by birth, blood, and endowments, then fellow subjects, let not onely men in the experience of all Ages be Judge, but even God, who in the uni|versal inclination of all Nations to Monarchy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tolossanus Syn|tagm Juris, <HI>lib.</HI> 47. <HI>c.</HI> 15. <HI>tit.</HI> 6.</NOTE> has sufficiently determined the dignity of it, as a Ray from his Oriency, who is King of Kings.

<Q><L>Quia &ugrave;t venator, feras libertate fruentes; ipse homines sibi compes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uit obedire.</L></Q>
<P>This is explanatory of the precedent words, and the Chancellour by it shews how he exercised his strength and activity, to wit, in chasing beasts as a preface to his Tyranny over men. Wilde beasts are the subjects of the hunters pursuit, because they being <HI>ferae naturae,</HI> and <HI>nullius in bonis,</HI> and God creating nothing in vain, made them not one|ly as tokens of his power and omniform wisdom, but as exercises of mans industry and sageness, and as helps to his lustre and accommodation of life; and should not man by hunting and slaying wilde creatures lessen the increase of them, not onely would the world be overlaid with them; but man himself the Lord of all creatures, of whom na|turally the dread and fear is in all Creatures, be overborne by the number of his rude and ravenous Subjects, and be less able to master them then comported with the order and absoluteness of his Empire. Therefore God has implanted in man a spirit thus active and daring, that the Creatures void of reason might (though in bulk and strength excelling man) be by the reason of man brought into subjection to him; and this being the secret implant of God in order to mans Dominion over the Creatures, the cor|ruption of man extends further then God originally intended, though not beyond the bounds he has successefully permitted, and in a sort, <HI>ex parte p&ograve;st,</HI> blessed. For though he loves not Tyranny as 'tis the lustfull and insolent rule of one over many; yet as one good Governor may by his rule over many bad, meliorate them, so he is not a disap|prover of it: order and subjection he wills, though the irrectitude of the means, and the
<PB N="185" REF="104">
truculency of the Subject, who transacts this, he approves not. That which then was reprovable in <HI>Nimrod,</HI> was, that he did violently and savagely hunt men, and suffer them to be quiet no where, till they had taken his yoak and would answer his spur and lash; which our Chancellour expresses by <HI>compescuit obedire.</HI> Because, as Beasts of prey that use to be at liberty and not fettered, are not got into Ginns and Snares, but in order to their destruction, either for the skin, horn, flesh, feathers, or some other parts sake about them; so men are not compelled to submit and obey, but sore against their wills:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Herodot. <HI>in</HI> Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">liope.</NOTE> for though all men dare not do so much for freedom as <HI>Hegesistratus E|laeus</HI> did, who taken by the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> and put in Iron Chains, cut off half his foot to be at liberty, and after that leaped over the Wall and escaped his Imprison|ment; yet all love freedom as well as he,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Xiphilinus Epi|tom.

And I suppose our <HI>quondam Kings,</HI> un|der whom it first appeared like indulgent Fathers, seeing their Subjects as dutiful Children, prostrate before them to beg the blessing of kindness and freedom from them, did in paternal commiseration and regal condescension, vouchsafe their desires: and thus they did <HI>erumpere gaudio propter concessum regimen politicum.</HI> For the Chancellor does not <HI>novum dogma propalare,</HI> not make the freedom and relaxation of our govern|ment to be a fruit of War, or (as it were) a trophey from the spoil of Princes, but he makes it an acquisition of favour, a reward of duty, a stimulation to obediential per|severance. And then lastly, he shews the reason why he does thus produce the go|vernments in their respective nature and fruits, to wit, that his Reason might be satis|fied, that <HI>Antiquity</HI> was herein <HI>found in the way of righteousness,</HI> and therefore to be ho|noured, and that as well King as People consented so to rule, and so to obey; and this takes off all the acrimony of People against their Prince, and all rage and severity of the Prince against his People; which a <HI>Commodus</HI> would never have consented to, for he laid aside the gravity of a <HI>Roman Senator,</HI> and appeared like a <HI>Fencer,</HI> using no com|panions, but such lewd Roysters; and the reason was, his design was, <GAP DESC="foreign">,

Now the Prince be|ing young and unfix'd, ready to evaporate his resolution with the next humour of in|stability, that took this Youth not yet radicated and well principled, his Chancellour runs out into this Discourse of Governments, that he might upon the good foundation of universals introduc'd, make this particular instance a more advantageous Superstru|cture.

He thus exposed to his shifts, casts about with himself what best and most advisedly he was to do; necessity tempted him to action, and resolution despising the danger of any attempt, made him in his own mind a Victor before an Undertaker. In his wander, (straights being the Womb and Sier of all desperate Atchievments; which though at first improbable, yet many times have glorious events (as in the case of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Empire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Egnatius, De Origine Turca|num, <HI>D'Avila.</HI> Hist, Et. <HI>p.</HI> 5.</NOTE> and the <HI>Fraconians</HI> com|ming into <HI>France</HI>) having no direct aym, but taking the best Road he thought proper for a booty, to <HI>Greece</HI> he comes, and there meets with some trusty <HI>Trojans,</HI> miserable and discontented like himself. Them in servitude to <HI>Pandrasus</HI> he commiserates; and as their concerned Countrey-man, whose blood boyled with disdain to see <HI>Trojans</HI> of stoutness reduced to Vassalage, promises either their redemption, or his own mancipa|tion: yet he wisely concealed his regret, and served his masculine intendment by such silence, as gave no mistrust to <HI>Pandrasus,</HI> or in any degree defeated the feasibility of his intendment. Finding therefore, that Prowess and Martial Activity was the Darling of <HI>Pandrasus</HI> and his <HI>Peers,</HI> he presents himself the Challenger of all comers to those manly Engagements; wherein he deserved to be, and justly was accounted the first of all the <HI>Youngsters.</HI> Being thus fortunated to a <HI>Military Grandear,</HI> he looks upon Envy as a Foe probable enough to advance her fatal Standard against him; and knowing that the invisible, though for midable power of that Tyrant, as to others she had, so to him might be, the ruine and marr of all his possibilities, immures himself as wise and sub|tlely as he might, against her. As he taught his Companions valour by his example, and order by his Discipline; so did he gratifie their merits by the spoil of his Atchiev|ments, endearing himself by that munificence to them, that they were but eccho's to his voice, and vassals to his commands. His first Rendezvouz was in <HI>Greece,</HI> whither all the roving <HI>Trojans</HI> and disbanded <HI>Debauche's,</HI> resort to him. (<HI>Asaracus</HI> of the Race of the <HI>Trojans,</HI> living in <HI>Greece,</HI> giving entertainment to them on <HI>Brute's</HI> account) when in a Body they were, they complement <HI>Pandrasus</HI> for leave to march through his Coun|trey; but with resolution to force, what they could not be granted. And though their pretence was to return to <HI>Troy,</HI> and to recover their Native Land; yet their design was to seize on whatever their power could master, and their Lust and Avarice be sa|tiated by. <HI>Pandrasus</HI> looking upon armed intreaties, but as modest Treasons and silent Threats, answers them with an Army well appointed, and martially com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ilio|nated, doubling also Guards upon the prisoners, whom he thought confederate with armed <HI>Brute</HI> and his <HI>Trojan Hectors.</HI> But alas <HI>Pandrasus</HI> the King being in possession of plenty, was becalmed with Luxury; and <HI>Brute</HI> being indigent and watchful, soon found an advantage to let him and his Army into their hopes, suddainly surprises the King and his Army, and seizes on the Town, and for himself fortifies it, loosing his imprisoned Companions from the servitude they were in, and enlarging them to be <HI>Compartizans</HI> in his prosperity. The released <HI>Trojans,</HI> who had smarted under <HI>Pan|drasus</HI> his severity, call upon <HI>Brute</HI> for Justice against the King; but <HI>Brute</HI> knew the meaning of those clamours, and unwilling to violate the sacred person of Kings or to pull down vengeance on him by so sacrilegious a fact, thought of some expedient diversive of their clamour, and propitious to his original design of acquisition and per|petuation. Thereupon he proposes in his Council of War, what course they would advise him to steer, that their co-operation being in the Council, the consequence, if evil, should not be onely attributed to his precipitance and ill conduct, but to that publique spirit that was the <HI>genius</HI> to it, and to that Fate, which (as regent) commands (under God) the issue of adventures. Amongst all the Sages of that Senate, none in this exigent, gave so oracular counsel, none so obstetricated the birth of the expedient to answer both <HI>Brute</HI> and his <HI>Trojans</HI> advantage, and King <HI>Pandrasus</HI> his freedom and restoration to his Crown (thus fraudulently and hostilely evicted from him) but old <HI>Memprisius</HI>; who being of great experience and grave courage, gave <HI>Brute</HI> and his Companions the swasive, not to violently come near the intemerate person of the King,

His counsel is that <HI>Pandrasus</HI> be treated with for the Marriage of his Daughter to <HI>Brute,</HI> and that in lien of her (and supplyes to <HI>Brute</HI> and his <HI>Trojans</HI> transportation) <HI>Pandrasus</HI> be released and restored to his Kingdom, and <HI>Brute</HI> with his Lady and armed Company, left to try and take their fortunes, and to disburden <HI>Greece</HI> both of their force and fears: this as wise and seasonable, neither beneath the spirit of Vi|ctors, nor insolent beyond the proportion of those that were under Mortal mutability, and might be shortly where King <HI>Pandrasus</HI> was, had the universal Concurrence.

Such <HI>Tygers</HI> and <HI>Monsters</HI> are men become, through the mistakes of Religion, that 'tis rare to find order in <HI>Communities,</HI> nor more civility then is the effect of fear and force.

<Q><P>Vt per hoc se &amp; sua quorum dispendia formidabant, tutius quam antea possiderent.</P></Q></P>
<P>When man by sin had broken his peace with God, then not onely the Creatures were let loose to great degrees of insolence against him; but the powers of mans soul that before were orderly and restrained, then rioted one against another, and all against him that rebell'd against his Maker. And then the security that men had each with other, while they were at truce with God, gave up its Charter and Priviledge. Now every man grows a <HI>Cormorant</HI> to his fellow, the weak the prey of the strong, and the fewer the spoil of the more in number. This keeping men in terrours, lesson'd them recollection of their dispersion. And therefore of old they did gather together, and make a common pact to defend each other; and to method their common defence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Covarruvias, practic. Qu. <HI>lib.</HI> 1. <HI>p.</HI> 419.</NOTE> appoint a Head by whom they would be led and ru|led. For Nature teaching self-conservation as a primitive lesson, found out no better or other method, then that of Government; nor any Government so peculiarly safe and contributive to peace and security as that of one. For besides, as I said before, Mo|narchy is of God, and generally approved the perfectest of Governments; it has been found, that more often and fatal disturbances have fallen out in <HI>Aristocracies</HI>; or <HI>Demo|cracies,</HI> then in or under <HI>Monarchy.

When men grow great and popular, they prove often Earth-quakes to Nations and places; for do but discontent them, and all is in a flame. Thus <HI>Rome</HI> felt <HI>Caesar</HI> and <HI>Pompey, Catiline, Mark Anthony, Sylla,</HI> and who not, that had a name and would thereupon be sure of an Antagonist. So in <HI>Italy,</HI> between the State of <HI>Venice</HI> and <HI>Genoa</HI> upon point of Rivalry; so great were the animosities between those two States for 100 years together, that they never met one another but with the mettle of Furies and the spight of Devils:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. <HI>Venice,</HI> 1 Book. <HI>p.</HI> 163.</NOTE> yea, though they had the <HI>Trevisian</HI> sports to dandle them into a calmness; yet even there, their Jest became a fatal earnest; and so much did their stomachs disdain Captivity each to other, though upon meerly the contingence of War (which ebbs and flows Victory, by an unsteady and blind event to men) that <HI>Andrea Dandulo,</HI> one of the <HI>Venetian Generals,</HI> being taken in a fight, and carryed to the <HI>Genoesse</HI>'s Gallies a Captive,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 165.</NOTE> rather chose furiously to beat out his own brains against the side of the Gallies, then be a prisoner of War to his Countrey's Enemies: and amongst the <HI>Venetians</HI> themselves,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 166.</NOTE> what Plots have the Governments of many Dukes been endangered by? witness that of <HI>Marino Baconio,</HI> who plotted to kill <HI>Pietro Gra|donico,</HI> the Duke,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 168.</NOTE> and such of the Senate, as pleased him not; and that more fatal one of <HI>Bajamonti Tepulo,</HI> who assaulted the Duke and Senate in the Palace; That of the Rabble in <HI>Giovanni Dandalo</HI>'s time.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 160.</NOTE> These and such like do shew, that as all Govern|ments are upon prudencies tending to conservation, so are those probablest best effected, when the Multitude are anticipated their mad fits, which ordinarily they are, more in Regalities then other forms.

thought upon and effected. For Kings for the most part have so much of divine Magnani|mity in them, that as they were in the first time of the first ages chosen Governours, and since are justly become Lords of their Countreys to do good offices, as Fathers, Shepherds, husbands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Law of <HI>Free Monarches,</HI> King <HI>Iames,</HI> p. 201. of his Works.

<P>This is the Argument that the Chancellour brings as inferential from the precedent reason; for <HI>posito,</HI> that Governments were of old by consent of the people, and that such their consent was to better their condition, to defend them from the rapes and violencies of men of fierce spirits, who came upon them with sword, and over-powr|ing them, took away their goods, forced their Wives and Daughters, and sometimes took away their lives, to prevent the clamour of their fact. These things yielded, it will (says the Chancellour) rationally follow, that if the Governour they put them|selves spontaneously under, do with their bodies, goods, and souls, what he pleases, they do not avoid the inconvenience against which they intended their subjection a mu|niment, but are under the same misery under another name, and so are little less then miserable, through the incorrespondence of the actions, with the intent of the Designers of them. For though true it be, that casualties may alter cases, and sweeten demeanours, which but for them would be tragical and barbarous.

I say, what can this be called less then a notable instance of great love to ones Countrey, which onely could come from a Princely spirit: which action had its

<P>Inconveniencies seldom come single: when Princes are other then they ought to be, Lawes will signifie little to minde or manage them; and ever it is seen, that as vir|tuous and pious Princes reverence Lawes, and will do nothing knowingly and design|edly to the affront and denigration of the credit of them, but let the Law have a free passage, and countenance the modest and legall averrment of it: so the contrary Prin|ces take pleasure in nothing more then in despising the Lawes and making them truckle under their Contempts and Violations; this the Chancellour calls <HI>laesio populi</HI>:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sit vox legis terror, sit legis paena fulmen; Draco non sum</HI> Atheniensis <HI>ille, neque leges sanguine conscriptas volo, sed hoc velim, ut voce panaque legis deterreantur omnes,</HI> Ca|sus <HI>in</HI> Sphaera Civitatis, <HI>lib.</HI> 4. <HI>cap.</HI> 8. <HI>p.</HI> 246.</NOTE> and that because the Lawes are the <HI>asylum</HI> and refuge that Subjects have, and if that be no shelter to them, they count themselves miserable; for some Law must be, and if the native Country Lawes do not rule, forein exotique Law must; and that, the Prince is brought in acknowledging too heavy for their stomachs to bear.

<P>This is added to shew, that as nothing discourages people more then not to be an|swered in the end of their loyal confidence, so nothing is more to be admired in and va|lued by Princes, then the practise of doing what they are by office and conscience bound to do; that is, ruling by Law to the prosperity of themselves and their Subjects. For as the King is then said to command,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Instit. <HI>p</HI> 186. <HI>on</HI> Westm. 1. <HI>c.</HI> 15. <HI>Resolution of the Iudges</HI> loco pre|citato, <HI>p.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">87.</NOTE> when he wills by the Law any thing to be done; <HI>and the King cannot do it by any Commandment, but by Writ or by Order or Rule of some of his Courts of Iustice,</HI> as Sir <HI>Edward Cook</HI>'s words are; according to which the Statute <HI>Marlbridge</HI> c. 1. sayes, <HI>Dominus Rex de aliquo contemptu sibi illato alium Iudicem in regno qu&agrave;m curia sua habere non debet</HI>; so the King is then said to act like himself not onely to his Subjects, but even to his own souls health and happiness, when he does what he does precisely according to rule and prudently according to seasons: for this is that which will best comfort him in his sicknesse and death, <HI>That he has walked up|rightly before God, and done that which was right in his sight,</HI> yea if a King should put the day of death, as a day of evil, far from him, and fancy (as I may so say) a tem|poral Eternity, generous and patronique actions to Subjects are the onely way to ac|complish it. <HI>Augustus</HI> made his Subjects happy and rich by governing them, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>according to Law and prudence</HI>; looking upon them as reasonable Crea|tures and treating them with no more rigour, nor no less goodness then the paternal Charity and Magisttatique care he was to expresse towards them required,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Xiphilinus Epi|tom.

<P>Here our Chancellour asserts the Law in absolute Monarchies of Conquest-Foundation, to be other then the former, and that upon no less valid grounds. For suppo|sing the Victor to be a Vassal to Justice, which restrains from violence and irrectitude, even when there is the greatest advantage and provocation thereto. I say, allowing this the wills of Victors over them, whom they have manlyly overcome, ought to be as effectually binding to obedience and contentedness under the Providence of God in the pleasure of such Princes, as in the former case; for as here people provided Laws of regulation and preservation of them, in what they had against the abreption of it from

<P>This the Prince is introduc'd to mention, not onely to insinuate to great men, that their duty it is, gratefully to remember fidelity and love of counsel to them; but in Pre|face to the memory of an excellent Treatise of the Chancellours, in which the fuller debate of the matter in Argument is handled. The Title of the Book is here mentioned to be <HI>De vigore legis natura,</HI> a Book no doubt of worth and weight, not onely be|cause the work of the Authour, who in all things was a very great Master, but also of the consequence of the matter, and the testimony it has to be backed by learned Rea|son. <HI>Pitsaeus</HI> mentions it,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ad Ann.</HI> 1460. p. 650.</NOTE> as no doubt there is but it was common in his time: but most of his Works, besides our Text, are lost, at least in such private hands, that they are as good as lost, which I ingenuously profess, I should be loath, if I could help it, any line of our Text-Masters should be: but it fares with Books as with Pictures, that pass from their first to after and other own|ers, till at last they are unknown almost whose they are,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tametsi quid libris commune cum pictura: pascit illa tantum oculos, hic animum men|temque instruunt; illa mutam, nanem, &amp; plae|rumque falsam descriptionem continet, libri, viventem praeceptionem, atque exactam spon|dent; Tabulas ctiam imperiti pingunt, lite|rarum monumenta non nisi ductisumi consi|ciunt.</HI> Baptist.

<PB N="214" REF="120">
which I dare call so great a weakness and vanity in them, as deflowrs the merit of all their other excellencies. Nor do I believe there is any true art in any man that envies the good eye of God on others, in making them instruments of addition to men and ages Science. Yea, I know there can no inglorious principle raise men that write to deny themselves the pleasure of life, as they must therefore necessarily do, if they were not excited to, and kept in the resolution of it, by that inclination that virtue works to beneficence, and that testimony they would give to men and times, that they did not live unprofitably,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Q.

And for my part, I think <HI>Tacitus</HI> his commendation of <HI>Haterius, to be as much a reproach as eulogie to him. Haterius</HI> (said he) <HI>was a Senator by family and wisdom, noted for eloquence in speech, but died intestate as to any Records of it. What the age he lived in accounted him, was more Natures bounty then his care; for he did all on the suddain, as inconsidering after-times, so becomes his immortal wit mortal, and the main of his Eloquence inaudible to us.</HI> Thus fell it out with <HI>Haterius,</HI> and thus will it fall out with those negligent and incontributive souls, which treasure up (Miser|like) for no purpose, but to be said to be learned; <HI>Not considering, that there is no wisdom nor counsel in the Grave whither they go</HI>; and that it is a kind of <HI>self-felony</HI> to ab|breviate the life of God's gifts in them; which they do, that make themselves, though learned, die and be forgotten, who by their Works of Learning would live as long perhaps as <HI>Homer,</HI> or <HI>Virgil,</HI> or any Authours, which do out-last Lands and Con|quests, Families and issues. This premised, I return to our Chancellour, concerning whose learned Work the Prince is produced in testimony. And that to which he speaks is to this assertion, that the Power of both absolute Kings, and Kings by politique con|stitution, are equal; not as they are <HI>in actu exercito,</HI> for so they do evidently differ, but as they are <HI>in actu primo,</HI> that is, as they are proper exercises of power. For power as descending from God, and a Ray of his lustre accompanied with Justice, are in Con|fort with Equity, which environs and circumvallates it. And as God can do nothing but what is just, because every thing that is in God is God, and every thing that pro|ceeds from God is as God, good and holy and just in its cause and foundation: so every proper act of Power supposing an ordinateness to a good end,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Derivativa pote|tesias est ejusdem jurisdictionis cum primitiva.</HI> Reg. Juris, 2 Instit. <HI>p.</HI> 71.</NOTE> and by right and suitable means thereto, cannot exceed the bounds of such restraint, without a forfei|ture of its nature and denomination; which makes, that vice and excesses are no proper expressions of power, but rather privations of power, sin having defaced the Image of God in Man, and rendred him naked of that ability and exercise of a right understanding, and a conform'd will to the rule of rectitude, and standard of power. For the abusion of power in its conversion of itself to one mans accommodation, with the injury and vexation of millions of others, as well the Image of God, as that one, is not the true tendency of power; nor does <HI>dare formam</HI> to power, <HI>qu&acirc;</HI> such; but is ra|ther the absence of power, in which Lust and lawlessness, as <HI>Master of Mis-rule,</HI> rants and rages to an <HI>excerebration,</HI> which is the reason that Laws of modification are taken in, to qualifie the distemper of surprised power. For if the soul of man were emanci|pated by virtue, it would not need any regulation or monition, besides that of its in|ward Tribunal, which because sin does usurp upon, has some relief from those <HI>extern adjuments.</HI> Otherwise, suppose a Prince so tender conscienced as <HI>David</HI> was, when himself, that he durst not cut off the lap of <HI>Saul</HI>'s garments. Suppose his heart so soft and flexible, that with <HI>Iosiah</HI> he melts before God, and dare not abide the hearing of the Law, which so represents his own sins to him, that he is ashamed to make his re|turns so unsuitable to God's indulgencies to him. Suppose a Prince so chaste, as was restrained <HI>Abimelech,</HI> and upright <HI>Samuel,</HI> in whom there was no immorality visi|ble. Here the great indulged power to such a Prince, would be no other then what ex|pressed itself in just, holy, and good actions, because the power of them is in being and full oriency in the soul: but when the inundations of justice, kind|ness, and equity breaks out,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nobis ergo qui de jure disputamus qua sit in principe potestas, non licet nec licebit unquam in principe, constituere potestatem, qua ejus libidine &amp; liberae voluntate absque recta ra|tionis limitibus ducatur.</HI> Covarruvias, <HI>lib.</HI> 3; Va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">resolut. <HI>c.</HI> 6. <HI>p.</HI> 261.</NOTE> then is not the heighth of power to be accused, but want of power by a prevalence of weakness against it. <HI>Moses</HI> was as mighty a Monarch as ever was; his Will was the Law with <HI>Israel</HI>: yet do we not read, that ever he did that to <HI>Israel</HI> that they complained of (excepting onely in their petulant and frenzy fits) and the reason was, he proposed to himself no by-end;

For though true it be, that God's restraint on men be the superadded Curb to exorbi|tancy; yet true also it is, that there are laid from Nature, though lapsed according to the good Constitutions and habits of some men, or the particular extemporary or premeditated Resolutions of others, such restraints visible and emanant, as make the opportunities they have to the contrary, frustrate to all ends but those of virtue and power, as in contradiction to turpitude.

<P>Indeed the power of man is little but vanity and vacuity; as this life, the time of power, is but a span in length, so but a flower in duration; and all the sphere wherein mortal power acts, is but this vain and vild World, and no further is it capable of Re|gency, then by, and under God, and according to the Commissions of his permission.

<P>This conclusion of the Chapter presents the Prince both rational and tractable; and in the one an acknowledger of the Chancellour's learned assistance: so in the other an expecter of his further satisfaction, in what he yet rests uninformed in: having therefore from the prealleadged Arguments found relief, he subjoyns an insinuation o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a restant scruple, which his oracular Head is to salve, <HI>Solum igitur mihi superest.</HI></P>

For notwithstanding it cannot be denied, but that God does give often those that are born to greatness, wits and minds suitable thereto, and paramounting the ordinary indulgency to other men, as far as their hopes and fortunes are beyond them, as <HI>Salmuth</HI> makes good in many notable examples: yet are the highest accom|plishments in them but rude and dangerous, if not polish'd, prun'd, and regulated by grave and virtuous tuition: nor is all the know|ledge Youth has, any true ornament, if it reduce not the mind un|der the Empire of virtue, and settle it not on the appetition of useful knowledg; for as the body may be without delicate food, and thrive well, yet will have no grand strength without bread, which is the staff of life: so the mind may be variously adorned with studds, and embroideries of art; and yet being void of true applicative Wisdom, need its <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> to remove it from imprisonment of errour and ignorance, to have benefit of the <HI>solum superest,</HI> that necessary, proper, and prudent knowledge, which it is losingly wanting in.

For as where there is no Law, there is no transgression; so where the transgression is not breach of a publish'd Law, there ought to be no punishment; for punishment is the effect of a sin committed, and by a known Law violated, the Magistrate provoked and despised; which in this Case not always being, since there are many offences against these Laws, which men may not know. Our Text says, that whatever the offence of not ob|serving Customs, and the Laws of nature, be in themselves; yet as <HI>Humane Laws,</HI> they are not in <HI>Magistratique Construction,</HI> till magistratically they be made such; and that they can onely be made, by being form'd into the method of Statutes, and passed as such by the <HI>Royal Assent,</HI> which chiefly gives the life and noble energy to them. And this the Chancellour sets down pithily and orderly;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Antiquitus leges Solonis axibus lig|neus inscriptae &amp;</HI> Romanorum <HI>in are</HI> 12 <HI>Tabul.</HI> Tholoss.

And surely the writing of Laws the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> mentions as a blessing in this regard, when he commanded <HI>Mo|ses to write the Law, and the Kings of</HI> Israel <HI>to write the Law</HI>; yea, when God wrote the Law (which omnipotently and primarily he had written on the Tables of man's heart) in <HI>Tables of Stone,</HI> to be a <HI>Monument</HI> of the <HI>perpetuity</HI> of its obligation, and the inexcu|sibleness of his breach, who knowing the will of God, and Law of his duty, yet does it not, but is rebellious against it; He exemplified to man the greatness of the blessing, to have not onely a Law, according to which he was to live, but a Law written; the sanction and imperation of which he might certainly know, by having it penned under his eye, and within the reach and capacity of his reason.

<P>This is the unalterable method of enacting and repealing Laws by the King, as Head of the three Estates, the Lords of the Spiritualty and Temporalty, with the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, all assembled in the two Houses of Parliament.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THis is the first instance of the dissimilitude of the proceedings of the two Laws, and 'tis in the enquiry of the truth of the matter of fact which is in controversie, upon which duly cleared, the Sentence of the Laws is given: for though both Laws aim at the discovery of truth, and in both Laws the Judges are to proceed, <HI>secundum allegata &amp; probata,</HI> and to deliver righteous judgment according thereunto; yet in the man|ner of the proof, not in the end whereto it tends, arises the discrepancy.</P>
<P><HI>Si coram judice contendentes</HI>] Here is set forth the parties <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con</HI> called <HI>conten|dentes</HI>; not that always there actually is, or religiously ought to be enmity of mind, where there is legal difference: for then the power of God in the Magistrates hand, would support a breach of that Commandement, which says, <HI>Love one another,</HI> and thou shalt not hate thy Brother in thy heart; because where ever there were rancour of mind, there would be a subterfuge to that distemper, in the pretence of legal justice;
<PB N="249" REF="136">
which though it too often be, yet is it not always, nor necessary to be so charged on all Contenders at Law; since sometimes that course is unavoidable, and may consist as well with habitual Charity, and amicitial integrity and fervour, as did <HI>Lots</HI> and <HI>Abra|ham's</HI> parting upon the contention of their servants; notwithstanding which, their friendlyness was full and cordial: but they are called <HI>contendentes,</HI> because the parties in course of Law are in a politique battail, wherein juridiquely they draw forth their Forces each against other;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Contendere pro de|fendere &amp; affir|mare.</HI> Celsus, <HI>in Praesat. lib.</HI> 1.</NOTE> the Plaintiff affirming, and the Defendant denying the matter he is accused guilty of; and because what men either love or hate, desire to have, or are loath to lose, that according to the impetuosity of their passion they apply themselves to the obtainment of.

So <HI>Tully, contra vim gravitatemque morbi contendere,</HI> and <HI>omnibus nervis contendere,</HI> and <HI>plurimis verbis aliquid ab aliquo contendere.</HI> This and the like shew, that the parties that would legally evict one ano|ther, are therefore thus called, because they do manage a civil Combat, and try a ju|ridique mastery, upon which they are said, <HI>coram judice contendentes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Coram judice</HI>] This makes contention lawful, <HI>in foro saeculi,</HI> because it is an ap|peal to the Civil Magistrate, as the Oracle and Judge; and it supposes him to have power, because it appeals to him for tryal and sentence, which it could not reasonably do, if it did not allow him cognizance of the Cause, which it doing, takes off all pri|vate revenge, and all contumacy against the Ordinance of God: for the Magistrate is set by God to settle debates, and thereby to prevent disorder, injustice, and con|fusion. Hence is it, that by the Law of Nature and Nations Judges are every where, and in all times, set up and repaired to, and all Contentions setled by them. And that this Office was Patriarchally in the Heads of Families, after in the Priests, after in Judges, civil Magistrates, and so is to this day, no Nation affords not testimony to it, no man can be ignorant of it.</P>

<P>This is written, to shew the danger that the positivity of two Witnesses that do af|firm, may do to the right of a cause; for if two in number assert upon oath what must stand, and the Judge must accordingly judge upon; then industry to seek out, and influence to perswade for love, compel by fear, or bribe by reward, may do what it pleases with two, that it may find out for its purpose: Which done, be the Judge never so learned &amp; just; yet by the Civil-Law, he is supposed <HI>by our text</HI> to give Sentence accor|ding to the fulness and positiveness of the Evidence; which though it be a reason urgable against any thing, which is mortal and mutable; yet is thought by our Chancellour an

So that all things considered, I do not understand our Chancellour's mean|ing, to impeach the Civil-Law of any defect; but to commend the Common Law, which to that way of proof by Witnesses which it allows also, superadds the tryal of Ju|ries as a remedy, if any subornation of Witnesses should be; which because 'tis easier done with two Witnesses alone, then with them and 12 Jury men, which are, and ought to be men of fortunes and integrity, when Witnesses are not required to be so strictly such. The Chancellour applauds the way of tryal in <HI>England,</HI> upon this conside|ration, that it is less probable to be tortuous, then that of bare Witnesses is. Con|cerning the stoutness of Juries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Holingshed, <HI>p.</HI> 1105. <HI>&amp;</HI> Seq.</NOTE> in keeping close to their Evidence in point of Fact, and not to be tempted or threatned there-from, see the carriage of Sir <HI>Nicholas Throg|morton</HI>'s Jury, <HI>primo</HI> Queen <HI>Mary</HI>: And by reason of the sufficiency of the Jurors re|turned, and the penalty in their corruption, there is (1 dare say) less errour in Ju|stice with us in <HI>England,</HI> then in any part of the World: yea, our Justices being such learned and grave Gentlemen, as they ever have been, and are, do so rightly inform Juries, in the right method of digesting their Evidence, that a nobler and braver tryal can no man desire,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note this.</HI></NOTE> then by a Jury of twelve men, <HI>Good men and true.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Et si contra eos pars altera dicere velit, vel contra eorum dicta, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
<P>This is added, to shew that every Action consists of two Parties: and as it is the Af|firmants, or Libellers part, to impeach; so the Libelleds, or Defendants, to justifie them|selves against it. This the Text calls in the Defendant, or Opponent, <HI>contra eas dicere,</HI> a crimination of their persons; or <HI>contra eorum dicta,</HI> an impeachment of their Evi|dence. For as the Law does not allow an infamous person to bear witness; so not his witness to be believed, but excepted against, if he be rationally presumed not to be upright in it: onely that which seems hard, is, <HI>Non semper continget eos eorum mores, eut facta apud contradicere volentem agnosci, ut ex eorum faeditate, &amp; vitis testes illi pos|sunt reprobari.</HI> 'Tis true indeed, it were to be wished, that Witnesses might be en|quired into, what fashion they are of, and where they live, and how they behave themselves, before their testimony pass in a Court of Law. It were also to be wished, that mens hearts were so far knowable; that the fruits of them, in the faedity of their actions, and the contagion of their practice, might be publique and they not pass for <HI>Cato</HI>'s, who are <HI>Nero</HI>'s; nor for Saints, who are Devils: but that not being possi|ble, nor any humane Law usurping cognizance of the good or evil intent of men, but as they are manifested and visibilitated in the practice. How are the Civil Laws to be blam'd, which when it appears, do provide against it, and by reason thereof, account the testimony weakned in a great measure. For though the Judge cannot arbitrate in the positive Rule of Law; nor in a civil Cause, deny the affirmatives of two Witnesses

Digest. Lib.</HI> 1. <HI>Tit.</HI> 16. <HI>B. in</HI> Text.</NOTE> though it be not such a curb, as that in tryal by Juries is. For there, though positive Evidence is the <HI>trump</HI> that ruffs all before it; yet that positive testimony is scan|nable, and having so many eyes upon it, may have a hole picked in the coat of it; and though the Jury cannot take notice of a negative oath, to ballance an affirmative; yet they may see such cause of doubting the clearness and veracity of such affirmatives, and they may hear truth, denying the charge against it by such circumstances, as if true, are inconsistent with the affirmative Depositions. And frequent it is with Juries to ver|dict, as they think in their Conscience, the truth of the Fact is, upon consideration of the Evidence on both parts; and if so they do, they do (as I humbly conceive) what they ought. For they being Judges of the Fact, are to determine, what their Con|sciences judges clearly proved concerning the Fact, and no more: and the Fact once stated and fixed, the Sentence of Law is pronounced by the Judge. So that all that hence, can be argued, is, that still falshood seems to be put upon a harder task, and amore inex|tricable labour, and to grapple with (as it were) an impossibility, which it cannot so ea|sily overcome or evade, in the evidencing before Justices and Juries, as before Judges alone; where they do but deal with two Witnesses, and one Judge, (who are a less number then the Electors of the Empire were, who yet by <HI>Richard</HI> Duke of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> were so made plyable, that they chose him King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> who was no <HI>German,</HI> and who was onely Brother to our <HI>Henry</HI> the 3^d;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tum propter ej<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s fidelitatem &amp; sa|pientiam, tum pro|pter sui thesauri abundantiam.</HI> M.

<Q><P>Quis tune poterit suorum aut sui ipsius, sub lege tali vivere securus; dum cuilibet sibi inimicari volenti, lex tali praestat subsidium.</P></Q>
<P>This is to be understood moderately; not as if our Text did make the Civil Laws subsidiary to injury; for that were to cast an odium upon the sacred Law of the Em|pire, which so great and so many Nations have in all Ages been governed by, and as strenuous <HI>Patrons</HI> as himself, do defend to be a very noble and learned Law, and con|form in the greatest part of it to natural equity. But in that the Chancellour says, <HI>Quis tunc poterit esse securus,</HI> &amp;c. both in body and fortune, when such may be evi|cted by two Witnesses of dissolute condition, who may be Sons of <HI>Belial,</HI> and for swear themselves, to act a malice against him. His sense is, that to him it seems a greater latitude is left thereby to such sinister courses, then in <HI>England</HI> by the Common-Law tryals are. For I take the words not to be <HI>verba approbatoria,</HI> but <HI>oratoria,</HI> and to have no further intent, then to make the Common-Law more popular, and applicable to general security, then he would have the Civil-Law accounted. Nor is this thus inter|preted piaculary in our Chancellour; considering, that the Municipe Law of <HI>England,</HI> is the Darling of the Nation, and to speak well of what's Native, is much the honour of an <HI>English</HI>-man; though always it be a generous man's quality, to praise what he loves, with no reproach to what is rival with it, at least with as little reflexion, as his fide|lity to what he prefers, permits him.

And though men may possibly be secure in body and goods under tryals by Witnesses, according to the Civil-Law, as we suppose men are abroad: yet do I not question, but that the security of an <HI>English</HI>-man, under the Common-Laws defence and administration, is equivalent to any, if not para|mount to all.

The second propalates the activity of Prudence; 'tis no <HI>Dormonse</HI> that lyes snudging, and creeps softly, or ap|pears cooly: no, when it has well chosen, what, when, and by what means, and to

what end it is to act; it vigorously, and with a masculine fortitude executes them, <HI>aut vincere, aut mori,</HI> is the Motto of <HI>Prudence.</HI> The third discovers the fortitude of <HI>Pru|dence,</HI> 'tis big of a generous indefession, and a noble heroiqueness; what it has chosen it prosecutes, and in the prosecution is weariless and undiscouraged: these are the <HI>gradations</HI> of <HI>Prudence.</HI> Our <HI>Lord</HI> then does not in the first sense strictly predicate this <HI>(wiser) of the children of the world,</HI> in this place. For according to the <HI>examen</HI> of de|fecated and primitive reason, as the World is under sin, and the wisdom and tendency of it folly of sin; so the wisdom of the World is <GAP DESC="foreign">, a very senseless choice; 'tis the choice of <HI>Leah</HI> before <HI>Rachel, darkness</HI> rather then <HI>light, Belial</HI> with refusal of <HI>Christ</HI>: but our <HI>Lord</HI> says they are <HI>wiser in their Generation,</HI> because in the choice of the world, they do choose what's more quadrate to their sensual selves, a sensual world will best please a sensual heart, and sensual affections; and because the world is so con|sanguineous and proportionate to corrupt reason, will, and affection, therefore all the sails and streamers of endeavour are flying, to take the Worlds full wind in them; they make the World onely their choice, and admit nothing in competition with it; they have no other <HI>Diana Valentina,</HI> no other Mistriss they value and apply to; they <HI>rise up early, go to bed late, and eat the bread of sorrow,</HI> that they may obtain the world, and that had, care not what they miss: and herein they out-strip in generation the <HI>children of light.</HI> For though they have a more transcendent object, in whom are concentred all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, and <HI>though the Kingdom of Heaven, and the righteousness of it</HI> draw with it all superadditions; yet the whole thoughts of the de|vout soul fix not upon God, but scatter and remit their intention to couple with other objects, which makes them miss the mark of having God always ready to be their help in trouble, because they tempt him to punish their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rail inconstancy with some temporary withdrawings. O how rare is it for a soul to be of <HI>David</HI>'s temper, <HI>My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: the desire of my soul is to thee, and to the remembrance of thy name.</HI> Where are the Saintly Merchants, that sell all they have to purchase <HI>God</HI>'s pearl? and the <HI>Mary</HI>'s that forsake all the trash of the World to sit at their <HI>Lord</HI>'s feet? where are the <HI>Mary Magdalens</HI> that prefer to be mourners in the Sepulchre of a crucified Saviour to the theatres of mirth and the rooms of state and pleasure. The world, alas! has these <HI>Minions</HI> and <HI>Zealots</HI> for it, that will adieu <HI>God,</HI> a good <HI>Conscience, Relations,</HI> yea, even life for it; and all this with an heroiqueness and chearful gallantry, as they say, when <HI>God</HI>'s Clyents come to him with cold zeal, and serve him with refracted and divided affections, looking aside upon the world, when they seem to look direct upon <HI>God</HI>; like those of old, whom <HI>God</HI> reproaches for their prevarication with him, and requires them <HI>to cast away their abominations,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezek. 20.8.</NOTE> <HI>and not to defile themselves with the Idols of Egypt</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zeph. 1.5.</NOTE> and those whom he detects for <HI>worshipping and swearing by the Lord, and by Malchom.</HI> Such parcel guilt Christians, his Holiness cannot endure; because their pro|ject is to serve themselves of him, not to serve him with all their might: when a storm they see, they consult evasion of it, though it be with abnegation of the truth of <HI>God</HI> deposited with them, and professed by them.

<P>A formal trial it must be, and but formal; for <HI>Naboth</HI>'s vineyard had made him cri|minal before accused, and <HI>Iezabel</HI>'s malice condemned him before found guilty; Wit|nesses there must be, and two; three <HI>Iosephus</HI> will have, which <HI>Grotius</HI> says was usual upon a person of note,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nam adversus in|signis famae virum tres requiruntur.</HI> Grotius <HI>in loc.</HI></NOTE> as <HI>Naboth</HI> was: but alas, they are loose profligate men, that know not what they ought, nor care not what they do swear; something they must depose to convict him, and they boggle at nothing <HI>Iezabel</HI> will put them upon.

<P><HI>Iezabel</HI> gave the counsel, to falsly impeach him, and by Witnesses of ratification to sentence him; so is the Holy Text, <HI>ver.</HI> 10.

<P><HI>Vxor castissima</HI> Susanna] Three words of our Text pointing out her persons name, her minds virtue, her relation and state of life. Concerning names, to write at large, would be endless; divers Authours have purposely done it, and somewhat I have touch|ed of it in the <HI>Introduction</HI> to this <HI>Comment</HI>; That names were used ever, and are at this day every where, is plain; and that by the wisdom of the humane nature, to di|stinguish persons and things, and to nourish order, converse, and society, is plain also. And I suppose, as plain it is, that <HI>Susanna</HI> is not an <HI>Heb</HI> but a <HI>Greek,</HI> or exotique name. There is in all Scripture but once besides here mention of it, and that is <HI>Luke</HI> 8.3. where amongst those Women, <HI>that had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Susanna</HI> is one; by which I may conjecture, that as probably the name was given to persons of excellency, and bodily beauty; so were such named persons, troubled with impure so|licitations, the usual temptation and attendant of rarity and transcendency. And if they are not injured by, and prevailed on from those subdulous and captivating insinu|ations, 'tis by miracle of mercy, that reserves them to their future conspicuity, as in the case of the two <HI>Susanna's,</HI> the first whereof is the <HI>she</HI> of our <HI>Text,</HI> who is set forth in the story of her to be fair, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>a beauty,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, saith <HI>Suidas, to have no disproportion in her.</HI> Hence the Septuagint render that place, (<HI>God saw every thing that he had made,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 1. last.</NOTE> <HI>and behold it was good,</HI>) by <GAP DESC="foreign">, that is, it was
<PB N="273" REF="148">
such as answered the perfection of its kind. That then in <HI>Susannah,</HI> here termed <HI>good</HI> or <HI>fair,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. Suidas <HI>in</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> is a beauty of body and gate, of speech and utterance; a Jewel she was in flesh, and one that feared God, and as a chast Wife, made <HI>her husband the covering of her eyes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Vxor castissima</HI>] As she was honestly born, the Daughter of <HI>Chilchias,</HI> and vir|tuously bred, <HI>ver.</HI> 3. taught according to the Law of <HI>Moses:</HI> So was she wealthily mar|ried to <HI>Ioachim,</HI> a very rich and hospitable man in <HI>Babylon.</HI> And as to him, she was obliged by vow; so to him did she keep by resolution, and from him could she not turn, without blemish to her virtue, and loss to her happiness, <HI>for he was more honourable then all others,</HI> v. 4. These Charms notwithstanding on her, their lust endeavours to entice her to avoid; and that by such occult &amp; dexterous methods of design, as were propitious to their end, and but for the impediment of a miracle could not but succeed. First, they consider what she takes pleasure in, and mostly frequents as her retreat of safety and pleasure, her husband's garden; and there, <HI>Iews</HI> as they were, they would have made the sepulchre of her modesty. There where the senses are most pleased and satia|ted with the favour of scents, and the sight of colours, the melody of birds, the tast of fruits; there, where are shades against heat, and springs to relieve thirst, and re|treats for contemplation; there, are the lyers in wait to work mischief; as our <HI>Lord</HI> had the bloudy Agony in the Garden: so had <HI>Susanna</HI> her tryal in the garden. And se|condly so impudent are these <HI>Var<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ets,</HI> that though the garden were near the house, and in the close view of her husband; yet there would they have rap'd the onely lovely flower of his garden,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Qui suasione ple|ctenda matrimo|nia dividere niti|tur aliena, ipsius conjugium habea|tur illicitum.</HI> Edi|ctum Alathar. Regis, <HI>lib.</HI> 9. <HI>c.</HI> 49.</NOTE> his <HI>Susanna.</HI> As no fear of God, or love of the husband; so no prudence perswades them to choose another place, then that, which they thought least suspected, because adjoyning to the house. Oh the impudence of vain desire! it hurries men of age and wisdom into actions of folly and madness: no <HI>Sampsons</HI> of for|titude, no <HI>David</HI> of piety, no <HI>Solomon</HI> of wisdom, but lyes open to the temptation of his flesh. If he give way to its wander, and foster its suggestion. Oh danger! thou attempt us from all quarters; from men of high and low degree; from things lawful, abus'd; unlawful, used. Thou art on the earth of covetousness, in the air of ambition, upon the waters of tumult, with the fire of lust, in our beds of pleasure, in our shops of profit, in our studies of Learning, on our Benches of Justice, in our fields of labour, in our journeys of business, in our pleasures of retreat, in our Assemblies of Devotion. Thirdly, this fact was aggravated, by the advantage they took of her constant hours, as well as place to walk in, <HI>ver.</HI> 8. they saw her go in every day. Because use creates de|light, <HI>Satan</HI> watches to take us napping where our delights are, and if he cannot one day, hopes another to prevail: so did he use <HI>Potiphar</HI>'s Wife, to subvert <HI>Ioseph</HI>'s con|tinence, <HI>Gen.</HI> 39.10. <HI>she spake to him day by day,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>dietim,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, the word here. Poor soul! she took the garden to prevent temptation, and there she finds it; she walked there to see no body with desire inconsistent with chastity, and a wively fidelity, and there she is lustfully looked upon, and tempted to be made unchast. Oh! how studious ought we to be to please God, that being at peace with him, he may direct our paths, and keep evil from us, since our ruines are so often involved in our contents. How careful ought we to be to prevent evil, by denying the occasions of it, who are so watched by, and so stollen upon, by the many disguises of its Ave|nue. If a light dress, and a loose gate, and a bright active eye; let <HI>Hamor</HI> lose up|on <HI>Dinah,</HI> and the harmless disports of marriage seen by others, then the marryed en|joyers of them provoke <HI>Abimelech</HI> to attempt <HI>Sarah,</HI> whom thence he thought prova|ble the same to any Courtier as to her <HI>Abraham.</HI> If <HI>Caesar</HI>'s Wife prostituted her name by intuition of onely pictur'd naked men; and if <HI>David</HI>'s eye lost him body and soul in the lust of <HI>Bathsheba,</HI> and the murther of <HI>Uriah,</HI> how much care ought to associate our repasts, and the least appearances of us; considering, that the frequency of <HI>Susannah</HI>'s repair to her husbands garden to walk, prov'd an occasion of their des<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gn on her there. Fourthly, their lust was aggravated in the combination and unity of it, <HI>v.</HI> 14. <HI>they made one joynt stock of counsel, and to one purpose of action.</HI> Wickedness knows union car|ries on all enterprises, and therefore it's ever for agreement and conjunction. The <HI>Kings</HI> of the Earth are said <HI>to set themselves and the rulers to take counsel together against the Lord, and against his anointed,</HI> Psal. 2. And by this that of <HI>Iob</HI> is true of these <HI>Levia|thans; One is so near to another,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Job 41.16, 17.</NOTE> <HI>that no air can come between them. They are joyned one
<PB N="274" REF="149">
to another, they stick together that they cannot be sundered.</HI> Thus they conduct their de|signs to their issue, <HI>fortiter &amp; suaviter.</HI> No eye, as they think, seeing; no tongue censuring them. And if they fail of that, and discerned they be; then by their union are they more plausible in their defence, more pardonable they think in their guilt: as many hands make quit riddance, so many heads form deep counsel: then they ma|chinate how to put a creditable gloss on their putidness. O how glad are these Misere|ants of a <HI>Zoar,</HI> though it be but a fig-leav'd Palliado. Thus <HI>Hectorean madness,</HI> they call generous valour; <HI>Absalomish Treason, high-metled discontent; Tarquinian lust, kindness of nature</HI>; and <HI>high-bred civility, Solomonique lubricity,</HI> A <HI>Spring-tide</HI> of rea|son, covetous to know infinity of objects: And to this the unity of sinners inclining them, makes their union destructive to <HI>God</HI> and a good Consciences interest in us.</P>
<P>Fifthly, their lust was aggravated by the effrontery of it; they come upon her not with Pyrates colours, not with the soft and modest pretensions that win on credulity, and steal under the vizards of kindness, the monsters of lust; but rush open-mouth'd, like Beasts of prey that are in haft, and must do what they do on the suddain, <HI>v.</HI> 20. <HI>We are in love with thee, lye with us.</HI> O courtless rudeness! O mercyful mistake! by which they were prevented to win, whom they were resolved to ruine. O the mercy of <HI>God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jer 5.6.8, 12.</NOTE> that guards innocence! by its assault reversed, and its temptation disarm'd; <HI>because they were not ashamed, when they endeavoured these abominations,</HI> therefore <HI>God</HI> counter-courted them, and undermin'd their machination. If the <HI>Lord</HI> be on his <HI>Su|sanna</HI>'s side, she need not fear what men, old in sin and counsel, can plot, to act against her.</P>
<P>Sixthly, their sin was aggravated by the reserve of their malicious revenge, in case of her consent denied, and their plot defeated, <HI>v.</HI> 21. <HI>If thou wilt not, we will bear witness against thee, that a young man was with thee,</HI> v. 30. <HI>And therefore thou didst send away thy Maids from thee.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Deprehendimus ipsam</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>ut est,</HI> Joh. 8.4. <HI>Draco dixit,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Solon,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">.

When thus they were charged, <HI>Mot</HI> the Ravisher stood by trembling, but not discovered. When he saw, if he should re|store her, she would appear ravished, he meditated, to hinder the discovery by mur|thering her, and that he does; and that done, cuts the body in pieces, puts it in a sack, and casts it into the next River. Behold! the bloudy event of lust! Nor much unlike was that intended by the <HI>Elders.</HI> What defence has innocence against calumny: poor soul! she innocently went to cool her self in the Water of her Husbands garden; out she sends her Maids, probably not having confidence enough to be seen naked by her own Sex, whom she seen, could have been but the reflex of their own bodies, shut they must after them the doors, that no one may enter, but she alone may be private; this was her chast care, this her innocuous modesty, and sincere zeal to her <HI>Ioachim.</HI> But see how all this is by malice and intended rape frustrated of its purpose on her, turned as they think to her disadvantage.

<P>These words are the conclusive deduction from the Premises by which the Chan|cellour is not to be understood to lay blame on the Law-Civil, which allows deposi|tion of Witnesses, to cast causes, and rules Judges to sentence according to them; though they be, as in the prealledged Cases, never so unjust and perjurious: but serves onely to commend those Lawes most, where the greatest care is expressed to prevent them; which though the wit of man cannot do, without the Grace of God restrain; yet there is most probability of obviating it, where the se|verest scrutiny is of the Witnesses, and the most materiall Exceptions to invali|date them allowed: which for as much as the Civil Lawes do their part in the Empire, and the Common and Statute Law performs its part here; there is no cause to charge either of them for the Mischief of ill Accidents in their respective Orbs.

<P>HEre the Chancellour takes off the asperity of some Civilians against the pro|ceedings of the Common-Law by Juryes as well as Witnesses, upon consider|ation that even <HI>France,</HI> where the Civil-Law is the National Law; yet does allow the Rack to prevent false witness in criminal Causes, which is besides the ordinary Prescript of the Civil Law; whereby deposition of Witnesses is onely allowed to Conviction. Nor surely is it amiss that Lawes should be framed according to the Natures of the people over which they have influence, but very prudent and just it should be so; yea inconsistent it would be if it were otherwise. For as all people have cloaths,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tortura quantitas &amp; qualitas statue|tur seoundum mo|rum regionum.</HI> Tholosl. Syntag.

And as there was reason that led our Ancestors to try mat|ters of Fact by Juryes; so was there no doubt like reason in <HI>France</HI> for the use of the Rack, not onely the Purgatory, but the Hell to torture falshood, and by confessi|on of latent mischiefs to prevent innocent bloud-shedding. For though we in <HI>En|gland</HI> have a Rule <HI>Nemo tenetur seipsum accusare,</HI> and in Judgement of Law he is no offender that is not proved such; yet in <HI>France,</HI> because perjury hath brought many to death that have not deserved it, but onely had a charge from malevolence, and the effect of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>At in</HI> Gallia <HI>pro|miscu&egrave; omnes cu|juscunque dignita|tis &amp; nobilitatis fuerint cum lucu|lentioribus delicti indiciis torquentur si indic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">a duorum idoneorum testium fide constent.</HI> Im|bertus <HI>lib.</HI> 3.

For since the end of torture is punishment for indagation of the truth, it is thought fit there to do it by this means, which is <HI>Quinquepartite,</HI> and consists 1. of threats of Rack|ing. 2.

<P>This the Chancellour adds to shew his abhorrence of the wicked ingenuity of these torments; and his vehement abjuration in (<HI>Proh pudor</HI>) is first observable; for any thing that affects the heart with grief or the face with shame, Authours have ex|pressed by <HI>Proh dolor, prob pudor:</HI> and though <HI>pro</HI> be used sometimes and but rarely, yet <HI>Prohob aspirabilem literam plus afficit,</HI> say the Critiques, perhaps doing respect to <HI>H</HI> out of that Rabbinique reason, because 'twas a Letter of the name of God, and so dignifiing what ever it was conjoined with.

Our Lord <HI>Iesus</HI> when he prophetically beheld the City near to those exigencies, that the <HI>Romans</HI> soon brought it unto, wept over it; saying, <HI>O that thou hadst known, eventhou, in this thy day, the things that belong to thy peace,</HI> &amp;c.

'Tis well with the world, as now it effeminately is modell'd, that Ethnicism is over; for if such times should have been now as was then, the Text's <HI>innocens ille</HI> would have been a <HI>nemo scit.</HI> No courage can be in any soul but in the soul that is sincere; which because men are not, therefore God gives them up to fear fordidly, and deny the truth shamefully, as those Carpet and Out-side Reverends did I <HI>Mariae,</HI> who were zealous Protestants in King <HI>Edward</HI>'s, and as zealous Papists in Queen <HI>Mary's</HI> dayes: yea in the Convocation of 1 <HI>Mariae,</HI> there were of all the Clerks but six,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fuller's <HI>Church History,</HI> 2. part. <HI>p.</HI> 11.</NOTE> that withstood the reduction of Popery; and the Goodly Prolocutor <HI>Weston,</HI> told Master <HI>Philpot</HI> one of them; that because he stickled so against Transubstantiation, which was against the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England</HI>' consti|tuted in <HI>Edward the Sixth's</HI> time, <HI>That he was a Mad-man, meeter to be sent to Bed|lam then continue there:</HI> Lo a taste of innocency which will never cope with flames and tortures. That which enables to endure, notwithstanding all, must be faith in God and frailty supported and sublimated by him; this will make a man not onely dye dayly by mortification, but dy strenuously and suffer patiently for a good cause: and that not from a <HI>durities animi</HI> the effect of sin, but from a resolution hardned by the fire of holy zeal, which none has but that <HI>innocens ille</HI> which our Text speaks of. Who will do by the cause of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shutes <HI>History of</HI> Venice. <HI>p.</HI> 250.</NOTE> as <HI>Matheo Fasceolo</HI> did by his Country? He being a Citizen of <HI>Chioggia,</HI> when the <HI>Genoesses</HI> wann it from the <HI>Venetians,</HI> lost a great E|state in it; after which he repaired to <HI>Venice,</HI> and finding the City in a great strair, went to the Senate, and told them he was willing to serve his Country with all he could; his Estate he had lost, and had nothing left but his Wife and Children, and them he tendred to serve the State, though it were to be sold to raise money for the States use. So if God's glory be concerned, a good Christian, <HI>Innocens ills,</HI> will part with all that's dear to promote or rescue it.</P>
<Q><P>Et non semel mori mallet, dum mors sit ultimum terribilium, qu&agrave;m toties occidi, &amp; to|tidem gehennales furias morte amariores sustinere.</P></Q>
<P>This our Tex-Master adds as the reason why an innocent man would rather chuse once to dye, then long and often to be tormented; because in death there is but one short brunt which over, all terrours are past: but in tortures and torments, as there is scarce perfect life; so neither is there compleat death, but an interpendance of the miseries of both, and the mercyes of neither. Whereupon the Chancellour concludes, 'twere more eligible to an innocent man to dye for <HI>adoe</HI> as we say, then to be tormen|ted, which is protracted death: And that the Chancellour's intendment may more signally appear, 'tis fit to consider his order in that he proposes; 1. He concludes that a good man's choice is alwayes <HI>De re licita &amp; possibili</HI>; if he had his choice, he would desire nothing but what ought and is to be, <HI>semel mori mallet.</HI> Sin requires natures punishment by death, and God has appointed that all, that do live, shall dye. The Canon is, <HI>Dust thou art</HI> in nature, dust thou shalt be in dissolution by death; <HI>To dust thou shalt return</HI>:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gen.</HI> 3.19. <HI>Heb.</HI> 9.27.</NOTE> and Saint <HI>Paul</HI> declares this the second time, <HI>It is ap|pointed for all men once to dye</HI>; not for all Creatures, for good Angels live eternally, yet they are Creatures, <HI>But for all men, once to dye</HI>: not that all shall dye but once, for there is a second death mentioned in Scripture, which is the punishment of sin,
<PB N="299" REF="161">
and which wicked and impenitent sinners are condemned to; but once to dye as a pay|ment to Nature, which the best of men are to make then, this the innocent man chuses, because he knows 'tis God's appointment and Nature's order; and he yields to it, not onely as 'tis inevitable, but as certainly it is <HI>lucrosum quiddam.</HI> For Death to him is <HI>ultimum terribilium,</HI> that is, of natural terribles; his pains, his terrours, his wants, his defects, which in life pinch him, then adieu: and therefore to be rid of those incommodations,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.

And our Text seems to make tortures by this, a local Hell, an Engine of cruelty, and that not to be endured. <HI>Gehenna</HI> is a word adopted into the Greek and Latin tongues from <GAP DESC="foreign">, a Valley <HI>South</HI> of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> in the possession of <HI>Hinnom</HI> an eminent <HI>Iebusite</HI>; 'tis called also the Valley of <HI>Tophet,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iudges</HI> 15.8. 2 <HI>King.</HI> 23.10. <HI>Ier.</HI> 19.6. <HI>Ier.</HI> 7.3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> because abused to Idolatry and cruelty, <HI>For there they caused their Sons and Daughters to pass through the fire alive to</HI> Molech; for which God cur|sedd its fertility and changed its name: so that at last it became the lay-stall of the City, and every filthy thing was cast on it, this was <HI>Gehenna</HI> in the History. Now the sense of our Chancellour was, I conceive, to set forth the sanguinariness of Tor|ments, not only by furies, but by Hellish furies; which none, but he that is the Prince of darkness, and whose <HI>odium is versans circa totum genus humanum,</HI> could invent. And therefore I repeat my thanks to God and the Lawes of <HI>En|gland,</HI> that though Offenders do deservedly dy, when guilty; yet that their bodyes are not <NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="marg">Resolut. of the Judges in <HI>Felton's</HI> case. <HI>Difficile immo &amp; impossibile est, ut &amp; prae|sentibus quis &amp; futuris fruatur bonts, ut &amp; hic ventrem &amp; ibi mentem impleat, ut de deliciis transeat ad delicias, ut in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> utro|que saeculo primus sit, ut &amp; in coelo &amp; in terra appareat gloriosus.</HI> Sanctus Hieron. <HI>Epist. ad</HI> Julianum.</NOTE> tortured, but they left to that repose that Conscience will afford them, this is Christian-like in the Law: nor shall they need to be tortured here in their death, who are to be tor|tured (if they dye impenitent) for ever after death. Nor surely does the God of nature design to it an Hell every where, for since the good man's Heaven is hereafter, he may bare with his Hell here; and since the e|vil man's Heaven is here, it seems not just to add to his affliction, to torment him be|fore his time: this the Devils cryed out upon, <HI>Art thou come,</HI> say they to our Lord, <HI>to torment us before our time.</HI> And this, God, I am apt to think, did insinuate to men in the Patriarchal and pure Ages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tholoss.

Idem c.</HI> 17.</NOTE> yea and to the <HI>Iews</HI> his own people; for though dye Malefactours did by God's own judgement, either by stoning or by the Sword of the Magistrate, or by some immediate hand of God: yet those deaths were quick and dispatching, not protractive of time and augmenting torture. And when the <HI>Romans</HI> brought in the Cross, which was an Ethnick and torturous death, which the <HI>Iews</HI> in token of malice executed on our Saviour because of the torture of it which was inhu|mane, I suppose they are, in the Prophecy of their Conversion, and the sorrow that then should seise on their natural obstinacy,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Zachar.</HI> 12.10.</NOTE> said <HI>to look upon him whom they had pierce|ed</HI>;
<PB N="301" REF="162">
which is prophetical not so much of the spear that pierced his side, as of the nails that fastened his hands and feet to the Cross: By all which I humbly conceive the deaths of Malefactours by tortures may be thought not so Christian, as dispatches of them more calmly, by a quick stroak or sudden throatle, are. But it follows.</P>
<Q><P>Et nonne Princeps tu novisti criminosum quendam, qui inter tormenta hujusmodi, mi|litem nobilem, probum, &amp; fidelem, de proditione quadam, super qua, ut asseruit, ipsi duo insimul conjurarunt, accusare.</P></Q>
<P>Still the Chancellour multiplies instances of the invalidation of torments to discover truth, and the uncertainty of proceeding according to them; and as before he quoted <HI>Fringe</HI> for suborning Witnesses to depose falshood, so here now he produces an Ex|ample, in the Prince's own knowledge, of one that accused a man of Honour of Trea|chery; which he after Racking ratifyed to be so, and being racked again, when he found himself unable to live, confessed his Accusation false and himself only guilty. And this the Chancellour does, not more to shew the danger of relying too much on frail man, who in his best estate is altogether vanity, apt to be seduced by his cor|rupt heart to deal falsly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shute's <HI>Hist. of</HI> Venice. <HI>p.</HI> 292.</NOTE> and not to be pityed in being punished therefore, as <HI>Pipus</HI> the <HI>Florentine</HI> was, who being sent by the <HI>Hungarian</HI> with great forces to invade <HI>Italy</HI>; was bought off from that Warr, and betraying his trust returned, whom, the King of <HI>Hungary</HI> punished by causing him to have poured down his throat Molten Gold: I say, not onely does our Chancellour produce this example to shew mortal Villany,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Si ego latens in caverna &amp; quasi sub mo|dio non quidem lucens sed fumigans vento|rum quidens impetus, nec sic declinare suf|ficio, sed continuis tentationum variisque fatigatus impulsibus instar vento agitatae a|rundinis huc illucque circumferor; quid po|situs supra montem, supra candelabrum.</HI> Sanct.

they were to carry their Provisions with them, there being no Inns in the way, there this Provision was called <HI>Viaticum.</HI> Hence <HI>Plautus</HI> mentions the <HI>Viatica caena quae datur abituro,</HI> like those parting meals we call <HI>Foye's,</HI> as I take it, which men give their Comrades when they go to travel.

Saint <HI>Bernard</HI> thought so when in those words he said, <HI>Et sensum minuat in minimis, &amp; in gravioribus peccatis tollit omnino consensum.</HI> And hence was it that the Church,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Serm.</HI> In Caena Domini.</NOTE> when the Minister was satisfyed a sinner was penitent and had confessed ingeniously his offence, did for his comfort give him the Sacrament called here <HI>Corpus Christi</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Magdeb. <HI>Cent.</HI> 5. <HI>c.</HI> 6. <HI>p.</HI> 134.</NOTE> and a purgation of any one from suspicion by solemn taking of the Sacra|ment to oblige the truth of a thing was quittance enough: this was done in the case in hand, the Knight, that was by the person racked accused, is upon the Sacrament taken at his death,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Innocens dicitur, non qui nocet levi|ter, sed qui uihil nocet.</HI> 5 Tusc.

<P>This Clause notably shews the disarmation of not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">onely manhood, but even of in|tegrity by fear, the terrour of which, in the penalty that the bodyes of offenders feel under Racks and Tortures, is not onely probable at some times, but even apt with most to make them say or do any thing, though never so untrue and unjust, to avoid them. This, there is evidence of in this example, where not onely the fear of <HI>Peter,</HI> but the falshood even of <HI>Iudas</HI> seem concentred. An innocent person he accuses, stands to his Accusation in Tortures, then having no hope to out-live them, confesses the Knight innocent and free, and seals his vindication with the Sacrament to confirm the truth of it; yet, for all this, publishes his so great dread of the Tortures, that rather then suffer them, he would accuse any innocent man; nay his own Father.

<P>All that I observe from this Clause is onely, I. Curse of God on cowardise; ma|ny think to avoid tortures and death by fallacious complyances with wickedness: and God when they have shewed their naughtiness, has indurated the bowels of those they thought thereby to oblige, so that though they have loved the Treason yet they have hated the Traytor. For though confession of guilt be a due from every Christian at all times, and at death especially, that those that hear may be warned and admonished to live better that they may dye better; yet, when a man is near death to be so yarc of life, as to confess or rather fancya nothing and set it up as something, to lengthen out a few minutes of ease and life by what is indulged to it, as supposed truth, is to dishonour God and deserve no attainment of so cursed ends. 2. That though life con|ceal much of truth yet death often reveals it, <HI>demum suspensus, tempore mortis suae militem purgavit.</HI> 'Tis time to speak truth to men when men cease to a Malefactor, as they do when he is judicially dying; then cryes he for his Confessor, and decryes

his sewd Companions; then he execrates his debauchery, and exclaims on his costly idleness which made him facinorous, and for the punishment whereof he is a sufferer. 'Tis good and welcome news to charity, when a sinner converteth, and concludes well an ill life; and therefore the Angels in Heaven rejoyce for a sinner that repenteth, because not onely he by repentance puts himself into the arms of mercy, but also desists from that enormity which illaqueates and makes unhappy the life of many innocent holy ones, whom he traduces and misrepresents. There was not in all <HI>Scotland</HI> a more brave and pious noble man then <HI>Archibald,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Spotswood. <HI>p.</HI> 371, 372.</NOTE> Lord of <HI>Angus,</HI> in his time was; yet he dyed by incantation and witchcraft: nor was there here a braver Knight then this in our Text, yet he was accused of Treachery, and not acquitted by his Accuser till at the Gallows, and then the false Accuser had his reward; not that which the Priest by order of the Star-Chamber in <HI>Anno</HI> 1544. had, who was set on the Pillory and burnt in both Cheeks with an hot Iron with the letters <HI>F.A.</HI> which the paper over his head expounded for false Accusation;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stow's <HI>Chronicle Summ. p.</HI> 257. 312.</NOTE> or as the other in 1556. was, for accusing one of the Court of Common pleas of Treason: but by hanging at the Gallows by the head while dead, and then cut down and buried without Christian Burial.</P>
<Q><P>Taliter proh dolor &amp; quam plures alii miseri faciunt, non veritatis causa, sed solum urgentibus torturis arctati, quid tunc certitudinis resultat, ex confessioni|bus taliter compressorum</P></Q>
<P>This Clause affirms that which i affirmable of all relating to erring man, to wit, that nothing he fayes or does, is infallibly to be concluded upon further then it is regulated by a divine Principle, which regards truth and fears falshood as a provocation of the pure God, who is the revenger of it. Nor is the Argument here applyed more strong against tortures then any other tryal wherein men are instruments, who by being possi|ble to be corrupted, may so be under Juryes as well as tortures; onely this it shews that then the excuse of the invention of torments is detracted from, in the ineffectuali|ty that they prove to the discovery of truth, which, notwithstanding them, is con|cealed; and justifies lighter punishments (though mortal) to be both lesse barbarous, and as much, if not more effectuall then those. For whereas in <HI>France,</HI> where tor|ments are, trust is altogether to the acuteness of those sufferings, as if the terrour of them would work enough without any softer applications; With us in <HI>England</HI> be|cause our kindes of punishments are lighter, we do apply religious Arguments to the Conscience, and lay home the terrours of God to sinners; and because the Magistrate comes not to encounter this <HI>Goliah</HI> of Desperation <HI>in his own strength, in which no man shall prevail,</HI> but with spiritual weapons which are mighty through God; there|fore God makes them prevalent to work contrition and confession. Piety is the no|blest and nearest way to politique permanent Issues and Successes, Nor are Statists ever more wanting to themselves then when they neglect the spiritual weapons of the Church to second the carnal ones of the State. The bottom of any villany will soon|er be founded by an holy and serious Divine's humble Prayer, serious conviction, prudent encounter with a wicked Conspirator, then by all the terrours and allure|ments whatever; because <HI>Satan</HI> and his own corruptions incrust him against the one, but against the other which is God's Engine and Key by which he turns all the springs and wards of resolution and secrecy, they are invalid: this is evident in experience, not onely in many examples with us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shute, <HI>p.</HI> 209.</NOTE> but also abroad; the History of <HI>Venice</HI> has a notable story of <HI>Beltrand</HI> a popular man in that State, who was privy to the Conspiracy of <HI>Phalerio</HI> against the Government, whose Conscience so troubled him that he re|vealed it, brought the Conspiratours to execution and delivered his Country. And yet how hard is it to perswade the world that Piety is the best Policy; when as, if men would observe it, there is no folly like that of the worldling, who serves a Master which cannot support him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quam misera hominis conditio quae quasi mercenaria aliis laborat, sibi indiget, &amp; nisi aliena misericordia sustineri nequit, quotidie sub timidine sub timore gravem tolerans servitutem, &amp;c.</HI> Sanctus Ambro|sius, <HI>lib.</HI> De Interpell. <HI>c.</HI> 3.</NOTE> but leaves him as Saint <HI>Ambrose</HI> sayes, in an helpless and hopeless misery. And yet the world is a goad in holy men's sides, and often a snare to them; nay, ever so, when they love it above their boundary, when they take it as their friend, and delight in the repasts and umbrages of it, when they suffer it to corrupt their moderation, and to tickle and
<PB N="306" REF="165">
hallucinate their passions, and by them surprised, to engage them to foedity. There is a notable instance of this in Master <HI>Mountgomery</HI> the Minister of <HI>Striveling</HI> in <HI>Scot|land,</HI> who was a fierce a man against Episcopacy as any his contemporary; yet short|ly after this man accepted the Bishoprick of <HI>Glascow,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Spotswood <HI>Hist. Church</HI> Scotland. <HI>p.</HI> 316.</NOTE> which he fordidly came to by making over to the Duke of <HI>Lenox</HI> (who was his Patron thereto) the Land of the See, which the Duke had a minde to, and by taking in liew thereof a thousand pound <HI>Sco|tish,</HI> to be paid by the Duke and his Heirs; to which, I had almost said sacrilegious, Condition, no Clergy-man in <HI>Scotland</HI> would yield, and by yielding have the Bi|shoprick, but onely he. In which frailty we are taught to mistrust our selves, and to look on men, as temptable and various; and therefore the Text's inference is good, <HI>Quid tunc certitudinis ex confessionibus taliter compressorum.</HI>] For men not being them|selves when they are in pain and under pressure, <HI>the Oppression of it often making a wise man mad,</HI> there is little heed to be had to what is said or done under the torture of it. Nor has God given certitude to any thing that is extrinsique, for every thing being subject to his interposition, there is no certainty to be conclu|ded, but that he will rule all for the best of his glory and his Saints good; but as to outward things, alas they go cross, and are vicissitudinarious, and that by the spe|cial appointment of God; nor can any thing be depended on in them, or collected from them, but what is subject to contingency: Men intend one thing and God dis|poses another; States make Lawes to one end, but God nulls those Enactions by his occult pleasure, <HI>which alone must stand:</HI> yea, if Counsels and Lawes are never so well made and laid, if God do not reveal the seasons and opportunities when to set them on foot, and whereby to improve them; all the wisdom of Law-makers is de|feated. <HI>Doria</HI> the <HI>Genovesse</HI> was a brave General and got a mighty victory against the <HI>Venetians</HI> in <HI>Phalerio</HI>'s Dukedom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shute's <HI>History, p.</HI> 237.246.</NOTE> which had he prosecuted, as he might, and come directly to the City, he had utterly determined the <HI>Venetian</HI> Government and Power: so had the <HI>Genovesses</HI> after the taking of <HI>Chioggia,</HI> but God gave them no certain knowledge of the event; and so they missed the improvement of the victory. No more certainty is there of the truth of that which a tortured person confesses to avoid his pain, then there is of that which may, and may not be. Tortures are like Physick, on some trinid and easy natures they work fully and readily; but on others they must have notable acuteness to stir them: and when sink they do, 'tis their bodyes and nature, not their malice and venom that yields; confess truth they may, but as often they confess nothing at all; or if any thing, not that they should: And therefore the Text sayes, <HI>Quid tunc certitudinis resultat, ex confessionibus taliter compressorum.</HI></P>
<Q><P>Caeterum si innocens aliquis non immemor salutis aternae, in hujusmodi <HI>Babilonis</HI> for|nace, cum tribus pueris benedicat Domino, nec mentiri velit in perniciem animae sue, quo Iudex eum pronuntiat innocentem, nonne eodem judicio Iudex ille, seipsum reum judicat, omnis saevitiae &amp; poenarum quibus innocentem afflixit?</P></Q>
<P>This Clause is brought in to shew how instrumental some Powers of the world are to torment <HI>Christ</HI>'s Innocents, who are for the most part the onely sufferers in the world; at least in those exquisite torments which are the effects and instruments of the implacablest Malice. For as lenity in man is a ray from God's oceanal Mercy, so the contrary is a con sectary of God's absence and retraction from man; and when the spirit of man is simply natural, and has no adjunct good which sweetens and abates the tartness of its peccant rage; then is it virulent and demoniacally rapacious to make others as unhappy as its malice can, and to oppose its self to whatsoever is not as impetuously depraved as its self is. This being the Rise of Antipathy, the Road to Persecution, Tortures, the Emanation of it, fall to no Lot more directly then to God's lot, whom the world is said to hate, <HI>because it hated me</HI> (saith Christ) <HI>first,</HI> and be|cause they are not of the world; therefore they do not onely speak all manner of evil against,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Non exhibemns ullum gestam ho|norisicum coram statua obstante Decalogi praecepto seeundo.</HI> Grot. <HI>in locum,</HI></NOTE> but act all manner of evil to them, specially that of making their lives un|quiet and their deaths bitter to them. The <HI>proto</HI> instance of this in the latitude of its inhumaneness is here borrowed from <HI>Daniel</HI> 3.13. where the three children, <HI>Sha|drach, Meshach,</HI> and <HI>Abednego,</HI> more timorous to sin against God then to incurr the King's displeasure, refuse the adoration of the Idol, and accept the punishment that

Now this our Chancellour makes use of to shew the force of pas|sion, however it be objected; for as love to Idolatry, and indignation not to see it propagated, moved <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> to make the Decree, and the <HI>Chaldaeans</HI> to in|form against the three Children as Contemners of it, and criminal for so doing; so love to God, and confidence in his mercy and power, kept the three Children from complying with the Text's terms, <HI>mentiri in perniciem animae suae,</HI>] and made them chuse rather the fiery fornace then to worship the Image: Whence our Chancellour collects, that to sentence an Innocent is so great a crime that it not onely deserves from God a sentence of retaliation,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Matth.</HI> 7.2.</NOTE> according to that of our Lord, <HI>For with the same measure ye meet to others, it shall be meeted to you again</HI>; as befell the busie Informers in <HI>Daniel</HI> by judgement of <HI>Darius</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dan.</HI> 6. <HI>v.</HI> 24.</NOTE> but it also makes such a torment in the Consci|ence of a Judge that condemns him, that he never or very hardly sedates and abates it; but in the Text's words, <HI>Seipsum reum judicat omnis saevitiae &amp; poenarum quibus inno|centem afflixit.</HI> And how much a prudent natural man will decline the guilt of bloud, innocent bloud, we may see in <HI>Pilat</HI>'s case, who though he was cunning enough to make the best of his Deputy-ship, and knew the way to cajoul the <HI>Iews,</HI> and to ren|der them supple to Acclamation of him; yet, when his Wife sent to him word of her Dream; wherein she had discovery from God, that the Prisoner to be brought before him was a just man, and that the <HI>Iews</HI> thirsted after his bloud; which judi|cially they could not come at,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Matth.</HI> 27.19.</NOTE> but by <HI>Pilat</HI>'s sentence and delivery of him to them to be crucified: when, I say, in the 21, 22, and 23. verses, <HI>Pilate</HI> had done as much as he cunningly could, to blunt the rage of the prosequuting <HI>Iews,</HI> and to weaken and evir|tuate their evidence;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vers.</HI> 20.</NOTE> and yet for all this, obstinate they were, being set on by the chief Priests and Elders: when all this, I say, was done, and yet they would not be dis|couraged, then he took water and washed his hands before the Multitude, saying, <HI>I am innocent of the bloud of this just person, see you to it,</HI> v. 24. which, though I take to be no absolution of him, yet declares that he thought, that to judge Innocence to death is to draw judgement on ones self, and to bring Hell into a man's own Conscience; which <HI>David</HI> felt so sore, that he cryeh out to God, that of all Mercies he would bless him with <HI>Delivery from bloud-guiltyness.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 51.1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> And therefore our Chancellour, in terming cruelty <HI>Pernicies animae,</HI>] writes emphatiquely here, as every where; for <HI>pernicies</HI> comes &agrave;

<P>This <HI>Apostrophe</HI> our Chancellour uses to shew the tenderuess of his soul, which, though it can serve justice in pronunciation of its sentence on Malefactors, yet can|not abide the view of that execution it judicially awards criminals to; and this the good man thus sets forth to call men to tryal, whether they have bowels of compassion to Manhood, when they have resolutions of vehemence against vice the abusion and dis|honour of it. For since it is tragical to behold sanguinary executions, and custome is apt to naturalize cruelty to men, the Chancellour dehorts (as I think) in this ex|pression all Judges from seeing Execution of their sentences; least they should lose that softness and lenity which the Law intrusts them to express, where not derogato|ry to Equity and prudence.

<P>Here our Text-Master shews whence it comes to passe, that <HI>Ahab</HI> was thus seduced and that not from a contingency or a fortuitous casualty, but from a just and sovereign preappointment of the penal act of Justice upon him, <HI>&agrave; Domino prodiit judicium.</HI> He that made the World with a word can with a word doe what he pleaseth in it; He it is that commands times and seasons, men and Angels, creatures and Elements: the whole Regiment of Nature is his, to order and disorder it as he pleases; from this matchless Potentate, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, comes <HI>Ahab</HI>'s final and fatal Period, <HI>&agrave; Domino prodiit judicium</HI>: and that not onely that Prophets should be the men, by a lye in their mouths, the means of his deception; but that as God permitted the thing to be effected by Instruments proper thereto, so did he imploy none but such to those ends, because <HI>non decuit Spiritum bonum talia exequi.</HI>] If holy Spi|rits cannot in respect of their purity and charity condescend to those derogatory Acts of seduction and fraud, and such Artifices must be practised to effect the punishment of sinners demeritings; then either those that are proper for it must do it, or it must not be done, which omission not being allowable, for God's will must succeed, the deducti|on will be, that evil Spirits must be the Instruments; for the <HI>non decuit</HI> relates to the nature of good Spirits which is to do good, which execution of punishments <HI>qua&agrave;</HI> punish|ments and laesive to nature are not, nor is it suitable to the office of good Spirits (who are tutelars; to keep off) not Executioners to intrude upon men perplexities and discom|forts.

<P>This is that which makes the wound <HI>nunquam in cicatricem venire,</HI>] that is, <HI>never heal</HI>; for when a wound tends to a scarr, which is the sign of it on the <HI>superficies</HI> of the skin, then men reckon the festery matter is outed and all the noxiety removed, by reason of which nature closes its orifice and shuts its mouth from craving further aid from art, leaving onely the scarr as the testimony of its danger being over and esca|ped; but when the Conscience of a prodigious cruel sinner has got a wound from God's stroak upon it, and the sins of a cruel life, with all the aggravating circumstan|ces are marshalled and set in rank and file before a man, then he sees nothing but despair and horrour, terrours and amazements, such as <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Iudas</HI> had, and such as all bloudy wretches shall finde to their consternation, for God who is good and does good, cannot away with evil men and evil actions, but brings them home upon the Actors in all the tragical fruits of them.

<Q><L>Quos inter caeteros ejusdem Comitatus ipsi opinantur melioris esse dispositionis &amp; famae.</L></Q>
<P>Herein appears, that as they must be Knights and Gentlemen of the County, that (truely I think) primitively was intended <HI>resident, dwelling, and abiding there,</HI> as the words of the Stat. of 8 <HI>H.</HI> 6. <HI>c.</HI> 7.10 <HI>H.</HI> 6. <HI>c.</HI> 2. in the Case of Elections to Parliament are; though I know use interprets it, having Estates in the County, which is a kinde of fortunary residence. So, as they are to be men of Bloud, Birth, and Estate, so, of Fidelity and Intelligence, knowing men in the duty of their Place, and faithfull men according to what they know they ought to do; for this I take to be the sense of <HI>me|lioris dispositionis &amp; famae</HI> in general, and to this sense incline the words of the Stat. 42 <HI>E.</HI> 3. <HI>c.</HI> 4. where men fit to be intrusted with Commissions of Inquiry are called, <HI>The most worthy of the Country as well for the King's profit as the Commons,</HI> and the 23 <HI>H.</HI> 6. <HI>c.</HI> 8. calls him that is to be a Sheriff, <HI>a meet and sufficient man.</HI> But the speci|fique sense of <HI>melioris dispositionis &amp; famae</HI> here, I suppose is, Men of sober and re|gular life, Men of orderly Conversation, that walk worthy of their places and conspi|cuities; for so <HI>dispositio</HI> is ranked with <HI>ordo</HI> in <HI>Columella,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Columell. <HI>lib.</HI> 5. <HI>Ep.</HI> 101. <HI>Epists</HI> 45.</NOTE> <HI>Quis enim dubitat nihil esse pulchrius in omni ratione vitae dispositione atque ordine</HI>; so, <HI>disposita hominum vita pro bene constituta, &amp; quae non fluctuatur</HI> is in <HI>Pliny.</HI> Thus we say a man is well disposed when he does keep a good guard upon himself and lives virtuously,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic <HI>pro</HI> Muraena.

Injury is done which the Law must right, a Complaint or Declaration is entred in the Court, pleaded to, Issue joined, and to compleat it a Writ is directed to the Sheriff to summon a Jury of twelve able and ho|nest men to try the matter of fact; the Sheriff observes it, considers, and frames fit men into a Pannell, summons them to the certain Service upon the certain day of the return of the Writ; the Writ with the Pannell he returns to the Court, <HI>iisdem Iu|stitiariis,</HI> from whom he had his Writ to summon, and this brings the cause to tryal by twelve, or the failing Jurors to lose their Issues: so exact is the Law that it leavs nothing uncertain, but requires an account of all its Intrusts, <HI>Returnabit coram iis|dem Iustitiariis breve praedictum.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Ac dilucide exponetur eis exitus placiti.</HI>] What the <HI>exitus placiti</HI> is see the Notes on the twentieth Chapter.

This then, as to do it shortly and pithyly, requires ability, so declares honesty in the doing of it; For, it is almost <HI>sine qua non,</HI> to Right Judgment: therefore the Text adds, <HI>De cujus veritate Iurati illi curiam certificabunt,</HI>] that is, they shall give their Verdict according to their Evidences and the Righteous Instructions of the Court; both which if they follow they may be said <HI>curiam certificare de veritate.</HI>] For, the discreet Verdict of the Jury is a Certificate to the Judges, how they finde the Cause to be, and accordingly are led to dispose their Verdict upon it.</P>

<P>This remembers the method of Pleading Causes; <HI>per se &amp; Consiliarios.</HI>] Of old probably men that knew how, and would venture the Cause upon their own Memory and Judgment to manage it, were permitted to Plead their Cause; but laterly it has not been in any degree so: but as the Courts to encourage the Study of the Law, ex|pected Causes before them should be Pleaded and prosecuted by Juridique men; so have all Parties in Suit chose rather to take the cooperation of a man of Law, whose Profession it is to know the Patriall Lawes, then to hazard his Cause to save a Fee: And for as much as <HI>Counsell and Strength is for the War</HI> (not onely the Field, but the Court-Warr) and Causes are best defended by the Truth of their Cause, and the pru|dence of the Parties carriage in it: The Text sayes, <HI>per se &amp; Consiliarios suos in pra|sentia curiae referet &amp; manifestabit</HI>; That is, as the Plea is framed by Counsell, so is the defence or stabilition of it to be made by Counsell, and that vocally, <HI>in praesentia Cu|riae</HI>; and this the Text terms <HI>referre &amp; manifestare</HI>; that is, <HI>referendo manifestare</HI>: and this insinuates great accomplishments in Counsellours; Prudence <HI>tempestive refe|rendo</HI>; this <GAP DESC="foreign"> is the wisdom of a man exactly to observe, if he would succeed in what he attempts.

<P>Secondly, As the Counsellour must <HI>referre,</HI> which implies prudence, so he must <HI>ma|nifestare eisdem Iuratis omnes &amp; singulas materias &amp; evidentias</HI>;] and this implies Memory, Art, Elocution: For <HI>Manifestare</HI> is a word that argues a rescue of any thing from its shade and obfuscation, and a reddition of it apert and visible. This potency of Oratory, and strenuity of Memory and Invention, is that Engine which from the Can|nons and Sacars of Language discharges such batteries on the eares of Auditours as makes them intenable against them: which, when Counsellours abound in, and by it express the learning of their minds, they prevaile in all Causes, and over all Persons they are retained to Plead in,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Adeo negligitur Oratoria ab horum tempo|rum dyscolis ut in actionibus eorum faex quo que quotidiani sermonis fada ac pudenda vitia deprehenduntur ut ignorent leges, non teneant senatus consulta, Ius civitatis ultro derideant, sapientia vero studium &amp; prae|cepta prudentium penitus reformident.</HI> Quin|till.

<P>This then being the circumspection of the Law to prevent Perjury in Jury-men, the Chancellour is by me to be considered, not in opposition to the course of other Laws, but as recollecting his precedent arguments for the triall of truth by Juries; as that the Act of God and Nature determine not the remedy of Justice, that Witnesses are not taken hab nab, as we say, <HI>Ignoti</HI>] such as no body ownes, but are their own affir|mers; whose condition, life and way men are unsatisfied in, because secret and sub|dolous; Men never known in their own, nor ever known out of other mens way: nor <HI>Conductitii,</HI>] bought, and made Witnesses, as <HI>Plautus</HI>'s <HI>Fidicina Conductitia</HI> was, who played what Tune his Company called for: and <HI>Varro</HI> calls all works of Pay <HI>Conductitiae operae.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Epid</HI> 6.8. <HI>Lib.</HI> 1. <HI>de Re Rust.</HI> 17. <HI>Omnia conductor solvit,</HI> Ovid 1.

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><P>Sed quomodo in criminalibus Leges <HI>Angliae</HI> scrutantur veritatem, etiam rimare per|necessarium est.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HEre the Chancellour, like an exact Master, observes Method to the clear and kindly attainment of his end, which was to endear the Law to the Prince, and the Prince to it; and that upon conviction that it is the most expedite way to govern En|glish men by, and has the best means of discovering offences and providing remedies for them in <HI>England,</HI> that can possibly be found out: to which end considering, that causes relating to justice are either such as are civil, or criminal, having fully in the two forgoing Chapters treated of civil Actions with their remedies and manner of pro|secution, he now comes to Criminals, as they are tried and proceeded against in <HI>En|gland</HI> by the Common Law or by the Statute Law, which come under the title of <HI>Le|ges Angliae.</HI> And this he thinks not onely convenient to explorate and detect, <HI>sed peruecessarium,</HI> as that which unles removed will obstruct his after and more effectual passage; for his Errand being to the Prince, whose soul and reason he would conquer to and confirm in, so just and behovefull a thing both to King and people, as a good opinion of the Law of <HI>England</HI> is, he judges it <HI>peruecessarium</HI> throughly and abso|lutely requisite to evidence to the Prince, that the Law is not more defensive of privi|ledge, then Prerogative; nor a stouter Bulwark to civil Rights between man and man, then of the Sovereign's Person, Honour, and Prerogatives, the violation of which endowments of Soveraignty it judges criminal.</P>
<P><PB N="360" REF="192">And that the Chancellours intentness may more illustrate it self, I shall crave leave to touch upon two things in this transitionall clause. 1. The Epithite he gives the Lawes Enquest after Criminall Offences, <HI>Scrutantur Veritatem:</HI> the <HI>Greeks</HI> express the Verb <HI>Scrutor</HI> by <GAP DESC="foreign">,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ab</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>vel</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign"> Bec|man, <HI>lib. de Orig. Lingua Lat.</HI></NOTE> <HI>quod proprie est interrogando aut colloquendo scrutor, eli|cio, indago:</HI> and by this the Chancellour informs us the meanes and way of discovery of Treasons, Felonies, and Breaches of the Peace, which are all Criminalls, to wit, by way of Enquiry, Examination, and following offences by a wise and diligent persuit, while the bruite of them is fresh, and the stinch of them warm and reaking; Not but that the truth of some Facts lie a great while unfound out, because either secret, or not ripe for vengeance in their discovery: But when ever the Law has intelligence of offen|ces and offenders, by the Ministers of Justice, and Officers of the Crown, it eagerly pursues them, and dives into the Nature, Circumstances, and aggravations of them; and this to know is <HI>pernecessarium,</HI> because it implies zeale to Justice, and gubernative se|verity; which by prosecuting offenders is tender, and conservative of well doers: and this the Chancellour intends by <HI>Scrutantur Veritatem.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, The Chancellours drift in bringing Criminals to be discoursed on is no|table, <HI>rimare pernecessarium</HI>; it should, I think, be <HI>rimari,</HI> for the Verb is <HI>deponent,</HI> and has no active, because it is of active signification; the Nown <HI>Rima</HI> signifies a Cleft, Chap, or Chink, which is not close joyned: and by allusion <HI>plenus rimarum</HI> is by <HI>Te|rence</HI> the discription of a babler, who has such wide chinks and chops in his mouth be|tween his lips, that all secrecies pass thorough them: <HI>Plautus</HI> also uses <HI>invenire rimam</HI> to finde excuse, or means to escape, as little Vermin do at the least crevise, or chinke. Hence one sense of the Verb <HI>Rimor</HI> is to cleave,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. John. 5.39. <HI>Rimari est quae|rere valde, Festus</HI></NOTE> as Timber that is shaken by the winde doth, though the usuallest be to search out narrowly in every corner and cleft; so <HI>Clau|dian</HI> uses <HI>Iuga rimari canibus,</HI> for to Hunt with Hounds in every corner, to which our Chancellour without doubt has respect: telling the Prince, that as the Law is very ex|act in its appointment of all things that concern King and Subject, and is defective in no point of regimentall prudence; so is it his care to finde out apt words to carry his ardent affection to the Lawes of <HI>England,</HI> pleasingly to the Princes ear, and from thence to his love and affections.</P>
<Q><P>Vt in cis plenaric aguita ambarum legum forma, quae earum efficacius latentem re|velat veritatem certius agnoscamus.</P></Q>
<P>Here the Chancellour intimates to us three things; First, The end and use of good Lawes, <HI>latentem revelare veritatem.</HI> Secondly, The <HI>modus,</HI> by which Judgment is rightly made, and in what manner the Law does this, that's <HI>plenaria agnitione ambarum legum formae.</HI> Thirdly, The danger of civil broils to render National Law odious, and forraigne Lawes amiable; This I collect from the expression of <HI>ambarum legum</HI>: For our Chancellour would never have so eagerly asserted the Common Law of <HI>England,</HI> and debacchated against other Laws, had he not seen them probable to be competitors with the Municipe Laws, the love of which exotique Lawes probably he perceived, either stealing into the Princes heart, or whispred into his eare by Adulatorious Forraigners in the time of his Exile.</P>
<P>The end and use of good Lawes he makes to be <HI>latentem revelare veritatem</HI>: Truth is the precious Jewell which does <HI>latere,</HI> and is not come at but with toile and hazzard; which made the <HI>Pythagoreans</HI> say, <HI>veritas in puteo:</HI> indeed methinks <HI>Solomon</HI> had some meaning analogick to this, when he bids us <HI>get wisdom rather then gold</HI>; now both Wis|dom and <HI>Gold</HI> do not lie on the surface,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 16.16.</NOTE> nor are they obvious, but obtained with diffi|culty. Since therefore her lustre has such damps, and her price is so invisible,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp;c. Dyonisius Areopag. <HI>apud</HI> Sto|baeum <HI>Serm.</HI> 60, 61.</NOTE> the work of us mortalls is to prosecute truth so hard, and follow after her so earnestly, that we give no rest to our eyes, nor recreation to our lives, till we apprehend her <HI>Dulcis veritas in interiora melodia</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. Evagrius <HI>apud e|undem.</HI></NOTE> This therefore the Chancellour here publish|es to be the labour of the Law, <HI>Latentem revelare veritatem:</HI> to res|cue the beauty and virginity of truth from the rape and force of pre|tended virtue, but reall falsehood her antagonist.</P>
<P>For, such is the craft of the World's <HI>Polycrates</HI>'s, that they do <HI>omnem movere lapi|dem</HI>;
<PB N="361" REF="192">
to bury truth in the heap of fallacies, and to make Justice set up somewhat as a Law, which should bastardize her, and, in stead of her, legitimate that spurious product of villany, in justice. This makes the Law so exact to trie, so vigilant to avoid trapan|ning, and from this are often delayes occasioned, which are reall advantages to truth, not (as is supposed) methods purposely studied to enhance gain: For as Mariners, when they have but a bad winde often shift sayles, and waft from shore to shore, that they may make some way to their Port, and not lose all progress because they have not a full gale: so are Law-Makers necessitated to use all means to right Truth, and use all instruments to her clarification, rather then lose one grain or atome of her. For all truth <HI>qua</HI> such is mysterious, and to be sought after till it be found, if ever it be; and the least dram of it that we attaine as the consequence of our acquisition, will be well|come to us; and we shall account our selves to be recompenced for all our labour by it.</P>
<P>The truth then that the Law seeks for here, and having found reveales, is the truth of Fact; that is, whether a Malefactor be so bad as he is suspected, and accused to be: For it sometimes falls out, that the clamour is greater then the offence deserves; and if the punishment should be in hast executed, the Magistrate would be <HI>artifex injuriae non opifex Iustitiae:</HI> therefore Policy, that is well advised, cautions that a just assay should be taken of every man and thing, and that such Arts should be practised as may <HI>sever the precious from the vile,</HI> and the <HI>Gold</HI> from the <HI>dross</HI>; and that is done by examina|tions of Witnesses upon such heads as may best conduce to knowledge of what they un|derstand in the cause: For Lawes are intended to settle the rule of equall distribution both of mine and thine, rewards and punishments: and being directed to so usefull an end as is the decision of debates by the line and plummet of Truth, what more usefull benefit to humane Societies, then Lawes?</P>
<P>But how shall good Lawes be fitted to answer these good ends, or how shall men make use of good Lawes to the latitude of these good ends. That the Chancellour re|solves in the second place, <HI>Plenaria agnitione ambarum legum formae.</HI>] For knowledg of the forms which do <HI>dare esse,</HI> makes a man capable to judge of their fitness and con|ducibility to those ends. As it is not a trite skill in simples, and a bare book learned spe|culation that makes a good Physician; but the knowledge of the operation, and the view of them in practice upon Patients that makes an expert practicer: so is it not a light and oscitant touch in the study of Law that makes a man capable to judge of the Law, but an accomplished Mastery of the reason of it, and a coylification of it into ones Mother reason, rectifiing it thereby, that entitles a man to judgement of what the Law is, and is not. For Formes, as they are modelled and fixed to the freehold of the Law, are not purprestures that are destroyable without great inconvenience, but they are so fastned to the maine Principles of Polity, that with them they endanger the ruine of Government: For we must reasonably imagine that the setters up of them, wise, (and in their times) worthy men, had solid reason for what they did; and thereupon doing it, we are to conclude there is some inconvenience will ensue that demolition, which was on purpose raised as a Sanctuary to Order: The consideration of which may lead us in|to the reason, why judgment of Forms, Methods, and Regulations of Government in the World, is not committed usually to young and green-headed men, whose brains are too Mercuriall to fix, and too Sultanish to deliberate of things; but to grave and sad men, who are above the levities of youth, and beneath the dotages of old age. <HI>Byas</HI> that wise Law-Maker appointed no man to be Governour of his People till fourty yeares of Age;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> and the reason was, Youth is light and heady, Age is soure and infirm: and the usuall saying was, <HI>con|silia senum hastas esse juvenum</HI>; pointing out no doubt at this, that <HI>Experience the fruit of yeares is the season of Iudgment.</HI> And therefore as to the Case in point, he that will judge of whether Lawes Proceedings are best, must know the forms of both, which few fully do that are not of yeares; and spend not their yeares in study and search into both Lawes. Yea, suppose a man had the Law-learning of <HI>Volufius Metianus</HI> the Master of that renowned <HI>Marcus Antoninus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Epist. ad Pollio|nem.</HI></NOTE> who gives this testimony of him, that he was <HI>in legibus interpretandis experientissimus</HI>; yet if he be as <HI>Volusius</HI> was, <HI>in iisdem violandis longe magis exercitatus,</HI> what is he profited by it? Such a <HI>Volusius</HI> who askes, whether one thinks there be any Law in the World which he knew not, may be
<PB N="362" REF="193">
answered as he was, <HI>Dic mihi, estne ulla lex in mundo quam praestes &amp; observes?</HI> That then which must give a man a right judgment of Laws, will be consideration thorow|ly of the Forms, Steps, and Marches by which they move; and how suitable they are to the People, they are to Order: For our Chancellour now speaks to the Prince as sol|licited by his breeding and conversation abroad, to close with Forreign Lawes, under which he saw People Obedient and Loyall, and Countreys in peace: when in <HI>England</HI> where the Common Law had, in pretence, its course, at least where no other Law but the Common Law was admitted, Rebellion prevailed, and Civill Wars continued (a mote or beam in the Princes eye, which made him look as it were a-squint, or unpleasingly on the Common Law, and delightfully on other Lawes) the Chancellour Courts him to continue the Common Law his darling, though the other Law had some, yea much re|spect, as, in its kinde, it was worthy to have of him.</P>

<P>This vehemence of our Chancellour's well becomes his pious and divine soul; which knew, that to erre on the right hand, by too much lenity, was safer, then to erre on the left by too much rigour: And as I am bound to believe that his afflictions had brought God and him into intimacy, so does he in his actions resolve to follow God in all the actions of Judicature his Providence shall interest him: And hence it is, that as Gods delight is Mercy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isay. 28.21.</NOTE> <HI>and Iudgment is declared by him to be his strange work</HI>; so does our Chancellour here profess his alienation from injustice, and that if he must be a Judge he had rather rid the World of many Miscreants, then be accessary to the oppression of one Righteous Person unrighteously adjudged to death by him. And good reason he had thus to prefix his <HI>Mallem</HI> to that truth, because not onely the righteous man <HI>is bet|ter then his neighbour,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 12.26.</NOTE> and the best is to be preserved; and the destruction of one good man is afflictive to God, according to that of the <HI>Psalmist, Precious in the eyes of the Lord is the death of his saints</HI>:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 116.15.</NOTE> but also as one good and just man may be more worth then a World of dissolute (and God Damne Me) sinners; so is the testimony of God him|self, who,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 6. v. 12.</NOTE> when he <HI>looked upon the Earth, and beheld it was corrupt, for all flesh had cor|rupted his way upon the earth:</HI> yet in the seventh Chapter <HI>v.</HI> 1.

the unjust cruelty of the <HI>Iewish</HI> Nation against that <HI>Holy One, and that just One our Lord Iesus,</HI> whom they barbarously and with high contempt crucified, did God bring the fierce and puissant <HI>Roman</HI> upon them, who rifled the Temple, sacked the City, carried away the Nation captive, and determined the account of <HI>Iewes</HI> and <HI>Iudaism</HI> all the World over. These examples tell us, there is reason for the Chancellours <HI>Mallet</HI>; nor are the instances only in Scripture, whence the prepollency of one to many may be confirmed, but in other Authours also. <HI>Aristides</HI> is represented to us so just, that the <HI>Graecian</HI> Judges would preferr his word to many other mens oaths: and <HI>Socrates</HI> so matchlesly wise and exemplary, that after his Countreymen put him (the eye and soul of <HI>Greece</HI>) to death, they never did any brave action either at home or abroad; but dwindled away,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vnus ille vir ipse consul Rempublicam susti|nuit.</HI> Livius <HI>lib.</HI> 2.</NOTE> as if God revenged in their infamy the death of that Heroick.

So <HI>Fabius Cunctator</HI>; these and such like are famous above many. And if one worthy man whose Justice has the oriency of a Car|buncle, and glisters in the night of degeneration, to the dislustre and eclipse of those whose interests in the domineering follies of Ages make them dark as Hell, and dismall as those subterraneous labyrinths that the fiends of <HI>Satan</HI> retreat to: If thus, I say, one just person may be corrective of a multitudes exorbitancy, and reduce them from the e|vil of their wayes; good reason is there for this choice of our Chancellour, in desiring rather to pardon twenty evill doers, then punish unjustly with death one just man. Since in the one he contributes time (if God will give grace) to their Repentance, who by li|ving longer may live better:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 51.</NOTE> but in the other he drawes innocent blood upon himselfe, which <HI>David</HI> deprecates, <HI>Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou God of my salva|tion.</HI></P>
<Q><P>In hoc equidem processu nihil est crudele, nihil inhumanum, nec laedi poterit Innocens in corpore aut membris suis.</P></Q>
<P>As the guilty being impeached cannot (<HI>salvis legibus</HI>) go unpunished, so cannot the innocent be charged in his body, or any member of it; for the Law of <HI>England</HI> is a mercifull Law, and sayes, disclaimingly as to cruelty, as <HI>Perseus</HI> in a like nature did, <HI>Ne|que enim mihi cornua fibra</HI>: for the Law has nothing of the Adamant, Flint, Steel, which are said <HI>Cornu in pectore gestare</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Satyr.

<P>HEre the Chancellour mindes the Prince of the necessity his youth has to be in|structed in the Country of <HI>England,</HI> who is to judge of the Lawes of <HI>England</HI>; for in as much as the wisdome of Legislators is seen in conforming Lawes to the nature of the people they are to regulate, and the Lawes of <HI>England</HI> being thus suited to it and the Subjects of it, the right judgement of those Lawes will best be presumed to be, where the best knowledge of the Country, where they rule, is had. Now that not being possible to be in the Prince, whom the fury of what the Chancellour thought Rebellion, drove away; the good Man, who had long been a man of Law and Pru|dence, applyes himself to supply that to him, which the force of his Father's Extruder denyed him to be accomplished with.</P>

much cost, labour, and hardship, no Nation would have been eager after us: but when every conquering slave that could not live in his own Countrey but miserably, lives here bravely, and with ease; this made those attempts on us, which some times were repulsed, but when prevailing, took the season of the Nations dissension, and the Nations dissociation into Parties. So that God having indulged the Land of <HI>England</HI> with a brave Soyle, nobly planted, pleasantly watered, inhabited by Lords, Knights, Gentle|men and Yeomen, with Artificers, Labourers, and Common people in abundance: though this nineteen years here has been a fierce Civil War, in which funest Battells have been fought, and multitudes of men of all ranks, ages, and artifices; yet is there almost little sign of a Warr, no want of men, no visible depopulation; so fruitfull has God made this time of Captivity, that though many of the wealthy Subjects have been beggered and dimini|shed, especially such as had personal and portable estates, yet Forraigners went not away with the spoyle of it, the Nation still kept it, it is but transferred from men to men; <HI>Eng|land</HI> yet, blessed be God, holds its own. And therefore if it please God to give us, that are Natives, duty to our superiours, and love to one another, the ruine of <HI>England</HI> by these Wars may yet be its making; For there is a third way of Fertility, and that is Mans industry, which is in the effect a <HI>nemo scit</HI>; for it brings impossible things to pass: This industry, O! it can almost do any thing, it has (as it were) removed Moun|tains, or at least made wayes thorough them, so did <HI>Caesar</HI> over the <HI>Alpes,</HI> and <HI>Alex|ander</HI> in his voyage to the <HI>Indies</HI>: it has dried up and diverted Seas and navigable Torrents: it has erected <HI>Hecatombs</HI> and <HI>Pyramids</HI> from little attoms of principall materialls; it has made glass malleable, instructed in all Arts, Languages, Sciences, Pro|fessions: found out the use of Simples and their Compositions; of Mettalls, and their digestion; of Mineralls and their use; of Peace, Warr, Justice, Religion: nothing has been too hard for the industry of man to cope with and conquer. Yea, so far has it usurped upon Gods peculiar, that it has found out many secrets: and if <HI>Archime|des</HI> did not delude himselfe, could move the Center of the Earth if it might fix its En|gine.</P>
<P>Now though I do not believe industry can do all that's boasted of it, yet I do advised|ly conclude, that in the industry of man there is such a latent power and life of actuation, that it comes neer the verg of miraculous: thus have men devised engines of bat|tery and Military use, whereby the strongest Castles are surprised and won, and which seconded by diligence can do every thing: and hereupon have sundry noble atchieve|ments and notable been performed; yea industry has formed politics, and founded Empires;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vt ingenium ad|hiberetur ad tur|rim.</HI> M.

Deep and fat soyls, that need no soyling from sheep, are not proper for breed of them, though for raising the bodies of sheep they may be; therefore the breed is in hungry and lean grounds, where the Corn-fields are madefyed by their foldings.</P>
<P><HI>Vnde homines Patriae illius vix operis sudore gravantur</HI>] This is onely to be under|stood candidly, that <HI>England</HI> is no iron flinty Soyl, lying under the perpendicular of the curse, <HI>Bryers and Thorns onely to bring forth</HI>; but it is a full and free soyl, on which the Tiller lives as easily, and from whence he has as comfortable support for himself and his family, as any Nation in the world yields its inhabitants; and because the feeding of cattel is more advanced by prudence and care, then by toyl and labour, our Text sayes, the Country man, <HI>vix Iudore gravatur,</HI> that is, his flocks yield him profit when he stands still and lyes down by them as they feed: but this is not the condition onely of Country-men, their lives are divided between the Plough and the Flock; some there are that in some places wholly stock their grounds with flocks, but alas this Land has not many parts of it so fitted to it, but that even there are many Ploughs jogging also. It's true indeed, I believe <HI>England</HI> is the richest in flocks for number and goodness of any Island in the world, and men we have had, whom re|ports have made incredibly rich in Sheep, as that Ancestor of the Lord <HI>Spencer,</HI> whom same speaks (as is pretended, but with what truth I affirm not) to be by Record in the Tower richer in cattel then <HI>Iob</HI>; and that L. <HI>Cheyncy</HI> owner of one of the Islands in <HI>Kent,</HI> either <HI>Sheppey</HI> or <HI>Thanet,</HI> who being in <HI>France,</HI> and laying a wager with the then King of <HI>France</HI> of 100000. <HI>l.</HI> and when the King asked whether he was able to pay it if he lost it, he replyed, <HI>That his Sheeps tayls in the Isle should pay for it,</HI> and reported they are to have been of that value. I say, these and other instances may be produced of men very rich in sheep, but that thence <HI>England</HI> should be made onely a sheep-walk, and the ground rendred such, as yields fruits and profits without labour, is more a noble Character of the Chancellour's love to his native Country, then that which can be made strictly good; that it is a brave soyle, and that sheep abound in it, is true, so is the assertion, that men are as soon made rich by the standing of sheep, as by any thing, but that sheep are gold to all, and that all parts of the Land are proper for sheep, is not inferrable hence; though truely I think (but ever with submission to better judgements) that breeding sheep, and tending flocks is not onely a gainfull,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">, Philo <HI>in lib.</HI> De Josepho, <HI>p.</HI> 526.</NOTE> but a very divine Patriarchal course of life, and those that follow it have in a kinde opportunity <HI>Spiritu vivere</HI>: for besides that the care of flocks is in <HI>Philo</HI>'s words <HI>The Tyrociny to State-Government,</HI> and that the minde is exercised more in intel|lectual acts then corporal ones, gives the opportunity to meditate and dwell more at home then other Callings permit: thus <HI>Iacob</HI> is said <HI>To go out and meditate in the field,</HI> which probably was to read and contemplate while his flocks fed, whereas in the occupation of the Plough, no longer is there thrift then the Plough joggs; whereupon the Statute of 1 <HI>R.</HI> 3. <HI>c.</HI> 1. calls <HI>Handicrafts, easie Occupations,</HI> and <HI>going to plough and cart,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Budaeus <HI>lib.</HI> De Asa, <HI>&amp; ejus par|tibus, lib.</HI> 5. <HI>p.</HI> 261,</NOTE> <HI>laborious Occupations</HI>; for though in such soyles as <HI>Babylon</HI> and the <HI>Sybarites</HI> Country, there be 100, 200, 300 for one, as <HI>Pliny</HI> tells us; or truer 30, 60, and some 100 fold, which our Lord alluded to in that 13 <HI>Matth.</HI> 8. yet in most Coun|tries there being tougher soyles and less increases, the toils of Husbandmen are great, and their wayes and manner of life scant, narrow, and full of hardship, which makes the poorer sort of people, born and bred to misery, take to that, as the calling which is most suitable to their mean birth, breeding, and spirits, for by hard labour, con|stant tugg, and incessant vigilance, they do <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>rifle the monuments of natures riches,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chil.</HI> 1. <HI>Cent.</HI> 9. <HI>Adag.</HI> 12. <GAP DESC="foreign">, Eurypid. <HI>in</HI> Hecuba, <HI>Adag.</HI> 78. <HI>Chil.</HI> 1. <HI>Cent.</HI> 8.</NOTE> for the gain that arises by the crop on her, which when they attain, they have what they ex|pect in compensation of their diligence and charge, when as in the pastoral life there is not that pain and trouble required.

<P>This is added to shew that Juries are peculiar to <HI>England,</HI> because Country-men of estate are onely in <HI>England,</HI> in the several Hundreds of the Counties of it; now though it be usual for men of the Plough to be and abide up and down in the Country in Nations abroad, yet onely with us are they men of estate, and allowed, as such, to be judicial Members of Juries, and fit they should be Judges of fact on other mens e|states; because they have estates of their own, and so knowing what an estate is, are presumed to be more intent upon, and considerate about their Verdict in their Neigh|bours case. And this is the reason that not onely the Law requires they shall have solid and solvent estates, but acordingly such in very deed they have, most of them to a very convenient proportion, but some, and that not a few, <HI>qui plusquam sexcenta Scuta expendere possent.</HI></P>

<P>The Premises considered, and the Members of Juries being affluent men (above the
<PB N="392" REF="208">
exigences and pressures of life, which follicite men often, and sometimes, yea too too often prevaile with them, to exchange a good conscience for a transient accommod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|tion) and being also such as disdaine to stain their honours, infamize their posterities, endanger their fortunes; and displease God the righteous Judg, <HI>who delights in truth in the inward man</HI>; and being such as those in whom the <HI>posse</HI> and <HI>velle</HI> of integrity is upon no ordinary termes presumed to be: How, I say, these things well weighed, can by the wit of men and Governments, any more probable way be excogitated to preserve Ju|stice and right Trial then <HI>England</HI> by Juries has, I cannot conceive? For, surely there can|not be any thing cohibitive and repellent of temptation, if the fear of God and shame a|mongst men be not prevalent to the formidation of, and the abstinence from it.</P>
<P>First, <HI>Obtimorem dei.</HI>] For that being the beginning of wisdom, is that which layes the ground-work for all the after-superstructure; Feare of God keeps the soule stiff girt against all temptations, intent upon duty, vigilant over its affections, exact in charitable distributions: Fear of God is a complex virtue, that has <HI>omnis religionis &amp; boni rationem</HI> in it; 'Tis that which adapts a man to every command without dispute, to avoid every thing prohibited without seeking evasions, and attempting dispensation for non-performance, to observe every voice of God, either in his Word, by his Spi|rit, or of his Rod, and to follow the dictations of it: 'Tis that which searches the souls sesters, quickens its dimm prospect, sharpens its devoute appetite, nimbles its obse|quious foot, elevates its active hands, invigorates the whole man, to be what God will have him, and suffer what he has preappointed for him: And therefore <HI>Solomen</HI> who was an incarnate <HI>Lucifer,</HI> and knew experimentally, and thorough practice, what wisdom was, <HI>initiates it from the feare of the Lord,</HI> because that directs a man to make God the aime, center, and achme of his wisdom, and to be wise for his soul and eternity, both concerned and advanced by Gods glory, which his feare propagates; and therefore though heathens determine wisdom by knowledge of Men, Creatures, Books, Arts, and Politick Practiques upon them, though they are excited to good, and deterred from evil, by rewards and punishments, which bribe them to either one or other; yet the best prescript is, to take and leave, as Gods fear principles and excites us; <HI>Fear God and keep his Commandments,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccles. 12.13.</NOTE> <HI>for this is the whole duty of man: Feare God,</HI> and that will make us keep his Commandments, which are not grievous to his fearers, but pathes of plea|sure and peace: <HI>And feare God,</HI> by keeping his Commandments, for that is the best indication of our fear, and <HI>all his Commandments,</HI> for that testifies our internall sincerity; yea, and <HI>Feare God</HI> and <HI>keep his Commandments,</HI> for 'tis <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>the whole duty of man</HI>: Though not wholly the duty of man, for Angells and Saints feare, yea Devills fear God, and 'tis their duty so to do, as well as mans; But 'tis the <HI>whole duty of man</HI>: because, whatever God requires of renovated man, whatever he accepts as the reparation of lapsed Nature, thorough the Interposition of <HI>Christ,</HI> who fortifies the soul in his fear, and out-brazens it against its Worldly confronts to a per|sistency, is couched in this fear; This do O holy soul and live a Saint, and die and e|ver after live an Angell.</P>
<P>So then, the feare of God being such a curb, as heretofore in this Book in the notes on the fourth Chapter I have shewed it is to all good men, in the examples of <HI>Abra|ham, Moses, Ioseph, Iob, Ieremiah, David, Paul</HI>; the Primitive Martyrs, and all the Seraphick comprehenders, and Militant Heroicks, who keep themselves unspotted of the world, and meddle not with that abominable thing that God hates, <HI>ea ratione,</HI> be|cause he hates it, and because it makes them unlike him; whom their piety indeavours to assimilate, it must needs work upon precise pious soules <HI>proprie &amp; quarto modo,</HI> and restrain others of morall and civill principles, by way of proportion, and as result|ing from that surviving awe of God that is left upon their souls intemerate, and so it is amulettick. For, if the fear of man, whose power is only temporary, and terrible to the outward parts, the subject of its violence and dirily is such, that it forces him to do or not do against the eddy and propension of his genius and affection: How much more shall the feare of an immortall God (ruling in the soul by a golden scepter of love, and impending over the soul, erring from him by perfidie and elective dege|neration, clouds of fire and brimstone; and those eternally to be suffering in, without any possibility of reprieve, relaxation, or discharge) preporiderate it to do what he commands, and decline what he forbids, <HI>ob timorem dei.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="393" REF="208">Secondly, <HI>Honorem suum conservandum,</HI>] That's another stimulation to integrity, and a disanimation to perjury and prostitution of conscience; And this is so suasive with mortalls, that they will part with life rather then with that they account honour: though some will do as the old doting and unfortunate Captain did, who rendred a City of the King of <HI>Spain's</HI> to his enemy,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mariana in</HI> Hist Hispan.</NOTE> to save his head; but the King told him, <HI>Perdista mi villa y guardast&eacute; la barba cana.</HI> Sir, <HI>You have rendered my Town to save your white beard, which you shall be no gainer by</HI>: Thus sometimes it is, aud usually aske Hectors what the chiefe Article in the Creed of Gallantry is, and they will quote <HI>Honor &amp; vita aque passu ambularent</HI>; this is the <HI>Diana</HI> of this Worlds <HI>Ephesians,</HI> this the Image that came down from their <HI>Iupiter</HI>; such gods in the likeness of men they venerate: and what assaults this they execute, and are quickly in arms against; and by this zeale to their imaginary eminence (which consists chiefly in opinion and popular suffrage, and has it's systole's, and diastole's, as the ages humour is, more or less, quicker, or less smart) they think themselves safe in point of honour and reputation: Now the wit of man cannot contrive, should it be intent on the exploration many ages a more durable and certain way of stabilizing that, then Justice, the ready way to a good name, the great Idol that men fall down before sinlesly:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tholoss.

Therefore wise Governments have ever exal|ted those to Nobility, who either have had ample fortunes, or virtues attractive of such, ingenuity and diligence being magnetick of them; which, though it be not ever im|ployed in gross and corporally laborious courses of life, yet if it be in callings, that equally merrit of Governments, ought to be suitably rewarded by them: And here|upon, as Peace and Warr are the two poles on which the world of Government turnes, as the common sort of Arts-men and Labourers do follow those professions of Peace; fo the Nobles and Gentry do engage in courses of Chivalry, especially in <HI>France,</HI> where the Cavalry is made up of them, and that is the strength and glory of that Kingdom: For the Infantry being so kept under, by their indigent and suppressed lives, are not so considerable as ours are, whose spirits being boayed up by the freedom of the Lawes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pedites ut bellicosi &amp; fortes evadant, opus est ut in conditione aliqua non servili aut inopi sed libera &amp; copiosa degant, itaque si quod regnum &amp; status in nobiles generosos potissimum excrescat, Agricola antem &amp; aratores loco tantum &amp; conditione operario|rum inserviunt, aut sorte Tuguriastri meri existant, qui pro mendicis tecto coapertis haberi possint, equitatu certe pollere possit, sed peditaru mini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, Dom</HI> Baconus <HI>Can|cellar, in Hist.</HI> H. 7. p. 45. <HI>Edit.

And this is the reason that the Commoners of <HI>England</HI> being landed, are so subsidiary to their Princes and Laws in all kindes of aide and duty, because they have whereon to keep up their own spirits, and to breed their servants and sons to manly and lusty exer|cises, from which as their train, they ascend to ambitions of rivalry with men of gene|rous birth, and often have more of prowess in their minds then great born and bred men have, for though the Nobles and Gentry with us have the great Royalties and Demesnes, the vast estates and revenues, the lofty and towring Woods, the bottomless and rich Mines, yet the Yeoman and his fellows have very much riches in money, land, yea and Royalties too in every Shire. And therefore though it is the <HI>French</HI> Crown's interest to keep the Commoner poor, and the Noblesse their Cavalry may eat him up, and he not dare to begrudg their hard dealing, but crouch and cringe to their Great|ness, as thinking his answallowed down Carcass happiness and priviledge enough for him to have; yet the <HI>English</HI> Commoner is on better terms, live he in what part of <HI>England</HI> he will, as remote from Neighbours as he can, yet the Law is his Buckler, and the Nations justice so just a Guardian to him and his, that he (following his honest vocation, and serving God, his Prince, and Country according to the Laws) need fear no man further, then the fear of prudence and civility obliges inferiours to be dis|posed to their superiours: for though the Law and Custome of the Nation exclude High shooes from services of Honour and Command, such as are Deputy Lievte|nantships, Justiceships of the peace, Memberships to Parliament, from being Cap|tains of Trained Bands, personal service to Princes at Coronation, (I mean near their body, according to the nature of some Tenures, and sundry other things of the like nature;) yet do they not stand out-lawed and excommunicate from being rich in land and money, free in house-keeping and cloathing, but are what the Commoners of <HI>France</HI> are not, <HI>Possessores agrerum aliorumque immobilium.</HI></P>

but right without inconvenience to either Lawes, and the contenders for them, since all the zeal and fervour that men passionately appear in to the averrment of their darlings, is but that squib of wit, which, though it soars high, and blazes in the firmament of popular admiration, evaporates and dissolves in a crack and issue of nothing but smoak and stench; for God that made nothing in vain, but has given every living thing not onely breath but pabulary subsistence for its continuation, and a providence of sup|port to make that by his benediction effectual to that end; that same great and good God, directing Neighbourhoods to join into Cities, Counties, and Kingdoms, and to be governed by Rules and Lawes of prudence and order, has no doubt fitted every thing, not Lawes excepted, to every Country, and every Country to the Lawes his wisdom in the humane nature appointed for them; and the Lawes of one Nation will universally no more fit another, then all cloaths will fit one body, or one bodies pro|portion fit every bodies: In the common Principles, Lawes in civilized Nations all agree, though in the particulars they differ, as cloaths made all of one shape for mens bodies doe in the more or lesse of them; and as that is the best suit of cloaths that best sets forth, and most accommodates the body with warmth, agility, and defence a|gainst injury, so is that the best Law for any Nation, that most promotes its peace, piety, and wealth, and impedes the cankers and subversions of them; which since the Civil Law does abroad (and for ought I know deserves in that regard that character which a learned Professor of it gives, <HI>That if all the Rules, Maxims, Constitutions, and Lawes of all other people and Countries were put together,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dr.</HI> Ridley <HI>in his view of the Civil and Canon Law.</HI> p. 3.</NOTE> <HI>I except none</HI> (saith he) <HI>save the Lawes of the Hebrews which came immediately from God, they are not com|parable to the Law of the</HI> Romans, <HI>neither in wisdom nor equity, neither in gravity nor in sufficiency,</HI> thus largely he;) yet notwithstanding all this (which truely, being taken <HI>pro confesso,</HI> is very much for the honour of those Lawes) the Common Law of <HI>England</HI> has that specifick energy and adaption to the Land of <HI>England,</HI> as no Law in the world hath or can have:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Au|thour's wish.</HI></NOTE> And I pray God I and mine, and all the true men of <HI>England,</HI> may live and dye in the love and under the obedience of it, and of the Protectors of it, Kings; and their Counsellours, Parliaments.

<P>IN this Chapter the Prince is personated as scrupling the goodness and lawfulness of Juries, by reason of the seeming opposition the constitution of them has to the Law of God; for the Prince, supposing that God in <HI>Deut.</HI> 17.6. settled the decision of matters upon the mouth of two or three Witnesses, does exclude all determinations of judicial causes from any interest in them, but what is of the nature of that consti|tution, which the Prince sayes was a proof according to the Law of nature and reason, and not a temporary Law in the ceremoniality of it, determining with the Jewish Po|lity, which the Scholes call <HI>Vetus Lex figurae vel umbrae</HI>; and therefore our Lord, who was the dissolution of whatever was not moral, but by his coming abrogated, con|firms this to the <HI>Pharisees</HI> in <HI>Iohn</HI> 8.17. and <HI>Grotius</HI> sayes, that this was so generally received that it became proverbial,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Caterum Lex ista</HI> Mosis <HI>proprie ad facti controversium pertinens, in Proverbium transiit, ita ut de rebus aliis usurpatur,</HI> Grotius <HI>in Matth.</HI> 18.16.</NOTE> and so he takes the meaning of <HI>Iohn</HI> 8.17. &amp; 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.1. yea, because the weight of proofs shall not be scanted and want its full advantage, the Holy Ghost adds <HI>two</HI> or <HI>three Witnesses,</HI> not therby onely to exclude one,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hoc dicit ne pasiim sed cum discretione ad judicium mortis procedatur, in quo com|pescitur malitia invidorum,</HI> Hugo Cardin. <HI>in Deut.</HI> 17.16.</NOTE> but to take in a third for down weight if need be&punc; and this is the reason undoubtedly why the Lawes of Nations, and our Law chiefly, though they allow two Witnesses, <HI>good and stanch,</HI> proof enough,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sub testimonio trium peribit omnis malus, &amp; salvabitur omnis bonus; Patris scilicet Filsi &amp; Sp.

and ought to be believed upon his own assertion, but he appeales to the Lawyers themselves, who were his great opposites, and critically carped at him, and exhibits himself forinsecally to them, as one that ought to be credited, because his words and works had the testimony of God by miracle; and of their consciences, by the con|viction of them upon what he said and did: and therefore he sayes, having approved himself according to the method of their own Law, from the appointment of their own Law-giver <HI>Moses,</HI> not to beleive his words thus attested, was not onely to con|temne <HI>Moses,</HI> but to proclaime their enmity and malice against him, who, by testimony Juridick, was affirmed to be the true God-man he asserted himself to be: This is the Princes objection, that in as much as God had set down the way of condemnation to be by <HI>two or three Witnesses</HI>; and <HI>Christ</HI> the new Law-giver confirmed this, and subjected himself to the manner of triall concerning the truth of his Doctrine and Divinity; <HI>Huit legi contraire est legi divinae refragare:</HI> that is, to prescribe another method then what God has set, is to wander from Gods appointment, and to contradict the wisdom of God the Father in the positivity of his appointment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. 13.14.</NOTE> and of the <HI>Iudge of quick and dead,</HI> who approves it; yea, 'tis to set up mortall weakness against immortall Power, Goodness, Wisdom, and Soveraignty, which is Treason against the Soveraign of our soules: <HI>Nemo enim potest melius aut aliud fundamentum ponere quam posuit dominus,</HI> saith the Prince in our Text; and upon this doubt, not narrowly or pusilly raised, but breaking forth from reason and piety regnant in him, and evidencing it self in the pro|posall of its arrest to his gravity, who is able, ready, and willing to enlarge it, by his resolution of the difficulty does he apply to the Chancellour; this is the summ of this one and thirtieth Chapter.</P>

God, to which it's promulgation is the rule and line, so does the Lawes of Nationall prudence conform to the <HI>Mosaick Norm</HI> in the Moral and Natural rules of it, though they may alter and vary in some explanatory methods,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lex vetus dissert a lege naturali non ut ab ea penitus a|liena sed ut ali|quid ei superad|dens, S.</HI> Thom. 1.2. q. 89. art. 2.</NOTE> or additions of circumstance adapted to time and men; the liberty whereof may be conceived indulged to Govern|ment, by the <HI>Magna Charta</HI> of Christian liberty, to those notable and noble ends of carrying on order and Justice in the World: And, of this nature is the addition of Juries in <HI>England</HI> unto the <HI>two or three witnesses,</HI> which our Law does not do <HI>actu domi|nii,</HI> as if it arrogated a power of antiquation in the point of <HI>witnesses</HI> (for the Law does every thing by <HI>witnesses</HI>; where <HI>witnesses</HI> can be had that are <HI>fide digni,</HI> which the Lawes of God and all Nations enjoyne:) but it adds to <HI>witnesses,</HI> Juries; <HI>nutu pru|dentiae &amp; sub ratione majoris certitudinis,</HI> who upon their oathes and consciences are to Judge whether they think the depositions are true, and the <HI>witnesses</HI> creditable in that they have averred: For, as in bonds, the security men have by sureties bound with the prime debtor, does not make the payment of the debt less, but more sure: so in matters of <HI>witness,</HI> Juries empannelled to hear and verdict a cause in Triall, does not depreciate and abate the justice of decisions by <HI>witnesses,</HI> but enhanse the reputation, and imply the more credit and conscience in them. And hence I humbly conceive the Law of <HI>England</HI> may, on good grounds, be argued a very pious and just Law, in that it takes all advantages to promote Justice, the great soder of civill societies; and that not onely by <HI>witnesses,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 17.6. <HI>c.</HI> 19.15.</NOTE> which God prescribes signally, but also from that honour he does <HI>witnesses,</HI> by terming himselfe by that Name: <HI>Iob.</HI> 16.16. <HI>Mal.</HI> 2.14. and by terming his holy Spirit the <HI>witness</HI>; and his holy Apostles <HI>witnesses</HI>: all which proving his approbation of <HI>witnesses,</HI> concludes the Lawes wisdom and justifiableness in allow|ing <HI>witnesses,</HI> and without them (where to be had) ordinarily doing nothing. But yet, hence is there no ground to conclude that the addition of Juries is supererogative; and not onely more then needs must, but a sinfull supplement to that which is already perfect; which suspition the Chancellour takes off in those words, <HI>Non contrariantur licet aliter quodammodo ipsae in dubiis eliciant veritatem</HI>:] which is as much as if in other words I humbly conceive his sense had uttered; That, though there be a variation of the method in some adjuncts to it, yet no aberration from the end, discovery of Justice: For, as the intent of God was not the precise letter (sit hence then the number,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In ore duorum vel Trium] Bona fama, jus testimonii moribus Hebrais non habent a|mentes, pueri ante annum tredecim, fures e|tiam post restitutionem qui de alea victuant, publicani qui plus &aacute;quo exigunt, caprarii &amp; si qui alii ea factitant, qua verberibus digna sunt, Rejici etiam possint qui valde propinqui au<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> famili&aacute;res aut inimici sunt partium alteri,</HI> Grot. <HI>in</HI> c. 17.

By all which it appears, that the Church, which the Prince acknowledged the Pope his Cardinals and Councils to be, (appointing other|wise in this case then the word of God does in the prealledged Authorities of Scripture set down) doth as much seem to go above and besides Scripture as the Law of <HI>England</HI> does in case of Juries; since they, added to Witnesses two or three, do onely corrobo|rate truth and make it less capable to be deluded and prevaricated with, then upon the single account of Witnesses and their depositions, it might in probability be: and this I conceive to be the intendment of our Text in alledging this Canon concerning Cardi|nals, wherein the rule of God in <HI>Deut.</HI> 17. is in the Letter of it departed from, and yet without the Prince's scruple, which the Chancellour insinuates to dissolve this his scruple in the case of Juries upon no less if not a more rational and equitable ac|count. And therefore as this sanction of the Church concerning Cardinals, which the Prince (according to the Religion of our Chancellour's time) thought unerrable, was not by him concluded sinfull, because an addition of a greater number to that of two or three, and all to promote right (as was pretended) to truth, relating to those <HI>Praesulary Eminencies</HI>; so ought not the annexing of twelve Jury-men to the evidence, which is to the same end of evincing right and subverting its contrary,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quanto magis ponderat in Iudiciis pluri|um idoneorum testium fides, quam unius tantum, tanto tutiore aquitate nititur ista constitutio, quam duellum.

<P>This is relative to the story of the mercifull <HI>Samaritan, Luke</HI> 10. who did not onely come to the distressed and wounded man (when the Priests and Levites, who saw his misery, turned the deaf ear to his moans, and the pittiless eye to his sad misfortune (for the Text sayes, <HI>They passed by on the one side,</HI>) but <HI>bound up his wounds, putting in oyl and wine</HI> to purge and heal them, <HI>and set him on his own beast,</HI> and <HI>brought him to an Inn,</HI> and took care of him; and to compleat his courtesie, <HI>on the Morrow when he departed, he took out two pence and gave them to the Host, and said unto him, take care of him, and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again I will repay thee,</HI> v. 35.

Now these, if they came in question, if the parties were alive to prove them, were by them proved; but, if they were of old date, and free from suspition, upon production of them they were allowed (every man being as it were a witness for reverend and unspotted antiquity:) In these and such like cases the Law allows, and accepts of proofe by witnesses; but where the causes are referrable to a proper County, and a Jury of the neighbour can be had, <HI>Per testes solum lex ipsa nunquam litem dirimit,</HI> saith the Chan|cellour, adding the reason, because it is the most excellent form; <HI>Et remotior &agrave; corrupti|onis periculo,</HI> as our Text is, concerning the excellency of the triall by Juries, which this Chapter proceeds to treat of, see the Notes on the 25^t^h and 26^t^h Chapters, where|in truely I have written my thoughts of Juries, not, I hope, passionately, but with that gravity which becomes a sober Author, considering that legal Juries are not made up of simple men, of which scarce foure of the twelve understand the Evidence; <HI>so that it may seem rather to be a matter of superfluity then of good policy, to refer a mat|ter to their verdict, when, as they say, no other thing then as the judge taught them before; Stultum enim est id facere per plura quod fieri potest per pauciora,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Doctor <HI>Ridley</HI> in his View of the <HI>Civill</HI> and <HI>Ec|clesiasticall</HI> Law. <HI>p.</HI> 184.</NOTE> (as the words of a more learned then (in that) wise man's were) but Juries are, and ought to be made of men of worth and prudence, and when such, they are the readiest way to right judge|ment of fact of any in the world; and the <HI>mos patriae</HI> and ancient triall of <HI>England</HI> being established by these, no wise and worthy mans mouth is to be opened against them: the Rule of Law being,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Reg.

And this our Text referrs to the case of Marriage, the most excellent,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note this.</HI></NOTE> social, and free life imaginable (perfect Virginity and calm Chasti|ty, much professed but rarely attained, onely excepted.) This <HI>Marriage</HI> is called <HI>Matrimonium,</HI> because it of old was the Act of the will and affections, fixing parties upon each other in a constant and faithfull bond of love, cohabitation, and communi|cation of all things each to other.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ne quis in Matri|monis vinculo in|dissolubili. fraude deciperetur,</HI> Alex. ab Alex. <HI>lib.</HI> 1. <HI>c.</HI> 19.</NOTE> <HI>Alexander ab Alex.</HI> tell us that the Temple <HI>Virilis Fortunae</HI> was the place <HI>whether all women repaired that would stand to be chosen, and there they stood naked, that every one might see they had no imperfection, but were such indeed as their choosers took them to be</HI>: but from the beginning it was not so; for the purer ages, though they allowed candidation, yea, and as it were <HI>candida veste,</HI> the fairest carrying usually the Market away: yet there was much sobriety and modest kindness expressed each to other, and these parties were called <HI>Pater</HI> and <HI>Materfamilias,</HI> as much as those that though they had not yet coupled, yet did intend a Race of Natures improvement from them.

And this respect that the Law has ever had to Marriage, is the reason that <HI>clandestine Marriage</HI> has been decryed, as that which evil persons have pretended to credit leachery; and good persons, though they did it upon weighty reasons as to the world, and warrantable as before God, yet did not avoid that censure, which no humour or prudence, as they account this act of theirs, could countervaile. Better a thousand times not marry at all then privately, then to one that dares not, or will not be known of it. 'Tis a slavery which no inge|nious minde can content itself to be under, because it is subject to be upbraided, and dares not justifie its loyalty. Upon all which considered, the Chancellour's minde is now to be learned, and that is, that where the Law judges onely by witnesses, that being proved which is less, as promise of Marriage before witness, shall oblige; when the greater (<HI>Marriage</HI>) being clandestine and secret, though lawfull and firm before God, may be condemned, and one and the same man, by one and the same Judge, compelled to performance with the one, and suffer penance for per|formance with the other,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eorum appelat</HI> Quintilianus <HI>in quo ju|dicia publica exercebantur.</HI></NOTE> though that in different Tribunals, called <HI>Fora</HI> because the Judges sat in the Market places which were the most conspicuous and tenacious places,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Budxus <HI>in Pandect. in p,</HI> 35, 67, 269.</NOTE> and because thither people applied, the seats of Justice are called <HI>Fora.</HI> For as penance may be enjoyned in <NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="marg">Glanvil. <HI>lib.</HI> 10. <HI>c.</HI> 12. <HI>Quia Ecclesia non po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">est judicare de his qua latent, &amp; ideo si de clam contractis nuptiis coram judice Ecclesiastico agatur, cam dubium illi sit non interveniente Ecclesiasti|ca solennitate an fuerat factum Matrimo|nium, non potest compellere servare illud.</HI> Tholoss.

<P>Which considered, the Chancellour urges this effect of witnesses upon the positivi|ty of their Oathes (which cannot be softned by consideration of circumstances which in case of a Jury would be probably in some sort allowed) to be very hard, <HI>O quam horrendum &amp; detestabile diserimen,</HI> as his words are, which are an emphatick ejacula|tion, arguing admiration and vehemence, as if he considered a man thus straightned, as not knowing what to do, which way to take, but to be perplexed, as the <HI>Leviathan</HI> is described in <HI>Iob,</HI> so it followes.</P>

And this the Chancellour charges on the proceeding by witness, as causall of the confusion and uncertainty,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ligula modus magicus frequens apud Gal|los, quo excellentia Matrimonia solvantur, &amp; conjugale vinculum &agrave; deo institutum la|befactatur; &amp; tamen hoc agere non tantum perditorum hominum est, sed virorum bono|rum &amp; honestarum foeminarum, nec putant hoc tam enormi facinore deum offendi, quod id impune patrant omnes &amp; doceant.</HI> Boissardus, lib. <HI>de divinat.</HI></NOTE> but whether so or not, I deter|mine not, since arguments from accidents to Subjects do not follow alwayes, For though I know there be no such Magick Girdle in our Law, as <HI>Boissardus</HI> sayes amongst the <HI>French</HI> is usuall, and ap|proved to dissolve Marriages, by incapacitating the parties to act their kindenesses each to other, which is a perplexity, which every unhappy sufferer cries <HI>Prob pudor</HI> upon; yet, in as much as possible it is, that witnesses credited over-much by Juries, may drive a mat|ter to this fatall issue, I will not peremptorily say, that 'tis impossible, though I may safely say, 'tis improbable any such thing should, and, I think, without president, that <HI>Tale malum aut diserimen in casu aliquo evenire possit, etiamsi</HI> Leviathan <HI>ipse ca generare nitatur,</HI> as the words of the Text are; And so with a recollection of what has passed, and an application of the reason of them to the credit of the Common Law in this

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THis Chapter is purely transitional, and framed, by the liberty of Dialogue, to ac|commodate the continuity of the discourse; and to introduce the Chancellour, not so much imperiously commanding (for that had not well become him though the Nonages of Princes level them also to their Tutour's temporary and disciplinary Sove|reignty) as sweetly following the Prince with such tuition as might occasion his Que|stions, and such solidity as by answer might resolve them. Now, as in Comparisons there cannot be a total and compleat correspondence, but in some of the four feet they move upon, they are defective and untunable; so in Discourses Dialogique, there is not a direct and strict verity of History and Fact in every part of the questionary and to be resolved part, because that (like <HI>Chancery</HI>-Bills) being formed to discover, is composed of such generalls, as in the answer to them, will comprehend the matter aimed at to be resolved. For, as Rivers by circumambiency and circularity of current and channel bring themselves to their Center, and the Rider on them to his Port; so do Questions vagely, if with strength of art proposed, promise proper resolution to what is most material and of consequence in them. And hereupon, though I am apt to believe the Prince might answer in the love of his heart and satisfaction of his judge|ment this personation here, in those words; <HI>Video, &amp; cas inter totius Orbis Iura in casu quo tu sud&acirc;sti praefulgere</HI>;] yet do I, under favour of our Text-Master, much doubt his privity to the next clause, <HI>Considero tamen Progenitorum meorum,</HI> &amp;c.] because (as I shall in the next Chapter make appear) I know not whom of the Kings of <HI>England</HI> he could intend here; for none of them do I ever remember, so little concerned in their own stability as to part with the Municipe Common Law, the firm|est Bond of Sovereignty and Subjection next Religion, according to which it is fra|med, and which, in all the severity of it, it affirms; nor is it (were there any truth in the story of such mistake) usual for, or commendable in Princes, to mention their Predecessours with dishonour, as truely this is, <HI>not to be delighted in their own, but enamoured with forein Lawes.</HI> This, I say, being the Subject of this Chapter, and so onely the Prince's, as by it he is personated in the order of the Dialogue, courts me to no long stay on the consideration of it, but serves me for a Pass to the following Chapter, in the Notes on which the fuller display of these matters will appear.</P>
<Q><P>Satagentes proiude Leges Civiles ad <HI>Angliae</HI> Regimen inducere, &amp; Patrias Leges repudiare fuisse conatos.</P></Q>
<P>Master <HI>Selden</HI> on these words confesses, <HI>He understands not the Prince,</HI> and his reason is, because the Chancellour here, speaking in the person of the Prince, tells of some of his Progenitors, who, admiring the Civil Lawes, endeavoured extrusion of the Lawes of the Land, commonly used, and alwayes approved best for this Na|tion: <HI>and what Kings</HI> (saith he) <HI>of</HI> England <HI>ever desired the Laws of</HI> Rome? As inti|mating, that no president can be brought for this averment. But, with leave of that <HI>learned Gentleman,</HI> I think, if due consideration be had to the form of speech, 'twill not be strange, that he should put a question at large to receive an answer in point: For the Chancellour, being desirous to take occasion to speak of both Lawes, and of the conveniencies and inconveniencies of those to good Government and Order, and coveting a just provocation to bring them in view with reproach, who endeavoured to remove the ancient bounds, and to take off the dishonour from Kings, the faults of

<P>Of this see the Comment on the ninth Chapter, where the Text being the same with what it here is, the discourse thereon is proper to be recurr'd to; onely let me hint an instance of the moderation and bounty of one of our Kings, who commanded very sovereignly, yet was himself commanded to part with his own advantage for their good. 'Tis of <HI>Edward</HI> Grandchilde of <HI>Edgar,</HI> who remitted the <HI>Danegeld</HI> to the people, which he looked upon as the Devils heap, being exacted from the poor Subject by violence,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Et de tam fera Exactione, n&egrave; Iota u|num voluit retinere,</HI> Ingulphus Edit. Savell. <HI>p.</HI> 510. Voluminis.</NOTE> and therefore commanded the return of it to the owners, protesting, <HI>Not one far|thing of it so unjustly obtained should ever bide with him</HI>; which I in|troduce, not as the onely instance of such Monarchique bounty and benevolence (for later examples there are as great as it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">12 Car. 2. Note this O <HI>England</HI> and be thankfull.</NOTE> <HI>The Act of oblivion or free and general pardon, &amp;c.</HI> not being a lesser but a far greater indulgence, thanks be to God for giving his Majesty a heart to do it, and thanks be to his Majesty for being so free too, and so constant in that magnificent Action, which has, to use the Scripture phrase though in another sense,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Isa.</HI> 16.1.</NOTE> <HI>prepared salvation for Walls and Bulwarks of safety in the loyalty of his people</HI>) I say, I quote not that now, as the only instance of Regal Heroicism; but to minde men, that are strait-laced, and think Monarchy not so free a Government as the Republican way is, that Greatness of minde directs Princes to bound themselves where no bound is besides that of their own fixation; and that, be the Regal power what in the Ocean and Altitude of it, it can in a mortal man and managery be, yet even this great power, when it is dispensed with an eye to God the Judge, (to whom Princes as well as o|thers are, and shall be accountable, and in conscience to justice which Princes are to propagate and carry on) cannot be but beneficial to pious and peaceable Subjects; and that the freest <HI>Regiments</HI> men fancy to live under, will without this restraint either finde occasions by arrogations of advantage to it self, or take occasion of derogation from others, to exercise its power vexatiously. Enough then of this part of the Chapter, I proceed.</P>

<P>Who these were which the Chancellour predicates this of, I do not well know; for though King <HI>Iohn, Henry the Third, Edward the Second, Richard the Third,</HI> and <HI>Henry the Fourth</HI> may be as probable to be intended as any, in regard that the Chan|cellour might think, that the rigour of some of their proceedings, transcending the moderate tenour of the Common Lawes, tended unto somewhat incongruous with po|litick Dominion, and came too near to that which he here calls, <HI>Libere dominari in sub|ditos, ut faciunt Reges regaliter tantum principantes.</HI>] Yet that any of them did declare and produce so much displeasure against the Native Lawes, (because they were such a Sanctuary to liberty and such a Mall to the contrary, as <HI>libere dominari</HI> in our Text's sense would be, and shewed so great desire of other Lawes by which they might be the more lawless) as might give rise to this assertion of our Text, is to me a Riddle. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">confesse the confession of my <HI>learned Antecessor</HI> on this service to <HI>Fortescue,</HI> Mr. <HI>Sel|den,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Notes on Chap.</HI> 33. <HI>p.</HI> 41.</NOTE> who sayes, here <HI>I understand him not,</HI> from him I learn that there was a protesta|tion against forein Lawes, and that the King in Parliament declared, and that with a plenary concurrence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11 R. 2.</NOTE> <HI>That the Realm of England, unques ne serra rule ne gouerne par la Ley Civil,</HI> which shews, that they ever accounted the patrial Lawes most fit for <HI>England</HI>; and satisfies me, that there was no signal endeavour in our Princes to alter the frame of our Lawes, but that this, which the Chancellour here insinuates, has an eye more to some particular actions that signified, in the externity of them, some such tendency, rather then any studied and designed scope to such an impossible Atchiev|ment.

tim jecit,</HI> he waved all Titles of Arms, and betook himself to his native right, and built up his regality by those durable and firm foundations of Law and inheritance, which he would so use, as a King by just claime and right of descent ought to do. And though he discarded not other pretenses as second to this,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>E. Bacons</HI> Hist. <HI>H.</HI> 7.</NOTE> but kept them to obviate private enmity and publick contradiction; yet his great trust, next to God, was in the Law, which devolving the Crown on him, with it brought all perquisites of it, and laid all the obligations (<HI>I write the word with reverence</HI>) on him, to rule <HI>More Majo|rum,</HI> that is, by the <HI>Patriall Lawes:</HI> and how the issuant successive Monarchs from him have strenuously propagated this president all men know, that know any thing, and all men must confess, that will owne the truth. For though mistakes and preju|dices have given being to some seemingly-unpleasing actions, yet in truth there has been as great alienation in the mindes of our Monarchs, from introducing <HI>Persicam servi|tutem,</HI> (as <HI>Tully</HI> calls that Government which is <HI>Non modo Romano homini sed nec Persae cuiquam tolerabile,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In notis ad</HI> lib. 2.

And in <HI>Charles the Sixth's</HI> time, by reason of high Government, it came to that pass, that his very Servants banded against him, his Counsell plotted his ruine, and the chief Controulers of his actions were the Princes of the bloud.

This boundless Will in the dangerous ef|fects of it, is the cause of that <HI>His non ponderatis,</HI> which produces <HI>Tallagia alia,</HI> &amp;c. to the ruin and grief of subjects; for when Greatness is set upon the carier, and will go on <HI>non obstante</HI> Religion and Justice: O then 'tis nothing but God can <HI>remora</HI> it. Saint <HI>Clovis,</HI> the Founder of the <HI>Gallique</HI> Greatness, is storyed to commence his At|chievements after a method very dreadfull; He slew all his Kinsmen that their Princi|palities might come to him and his Race, he spoiled men prodigeously of their goods, he seised and slew <HI>Chararie</HI> and his son, condemning them (as they were polling) to be put into a Monastery; the son seeing the father weep bitterly said, <HI>These green branches will grow again, for the Stock is not dead, but God will suffer him to perish that causeth them to be cut off</HI>; which speech <HI>Clovis</HI> hearing of, said, <HI>They complain for the loss of their haire, let their heads be cut off,</HI> and slain they were. Add to this his Con|spiracy with the servants of <HI>Raguachair,</HI> and when they had brought <HI>Raguachair</HI> bound into his presence, he reviles him for unworthy the bloud of <HI>Merovee</HI> thus to suffer himself to be bound; and when those that he hired to binde him came for their re|ward, he reproached them with <HI>Avaunt Traytors,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">French <HI>Hist. p.</HI> 16, 17.</NOTE> <HI>Is't not enough that I suffer you to live, I love the Treason but I hate the Traytor:</HI> these and sundry the like which <HI>Gregory of Tours</HI> charges on him, make him a most grievous sinner though a great King, and the more grievous because so great a Personage. All these confirm, that <HI>Oppression</HI> proceeds from unlimited Wills. When Princes give way to vage desire, they bound no where, but think what they have too little, when what they would have, is farr further too much. Alas, What would the <HI>French</HI> Monarch have more then he has, who has all his Subjects have? Enlarge his Revenues he would, but to what proportion he knows not himself, nor doe his Subjects: <HI>Lewis the Eleventh</HI> advanced the Revenue of <HI>France</HI> one Million and half of Crowns; <HI>Francis the First</HI> doubled that Advance; his Suc|cessour <HI>Henry the Second</HI> doubled the first double; <HI>Charles the Ninth</HI> added to the six Millions a seventh; <HI>Henry the Third</HI> brought the seven to ten Millions, and after to fifteen; in <HI>Henry the Fourths</HI> time the Treasurer of the Duke of <HI>Mayenn</HI> said that his Master had more improved the Revenues of the Crown of <HI>France</HI> then any King had done before him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heylin's <HI>Geogr.</HI> p. 238.</NOTE> advancing it from two to five Millions Sterling, and yet not a tenth part come clearly to the King's Revenue, the Crown having 30000 Officers to gather its Revenue.

<P>This <HI>Leut</HI> all the year with the poor Drudges of <HI>France,</HI> our Text produces as a further argument of the tenuity of their condition, and their Taxes exhaustion from them. For that they eat no flesh, is not (I conceive) from any religious observation, or any State-injunction, but purely for cheapness sake; and by their hard dyet to enable them to keep somewhat about them to entertain their Masters with, when they come abroad: and without which to treat and appease them, they would be cruelly tyrannous. For flesh they breed up and have, and stomachs they have to eat it, and <HI>a snap now and then</HI> they get of it; but they dyet on roots, grains, and fruits, which they make into pottages: this the Text calls <HI>Pulmentaria</HI>] the same in effect with <HI>Pul|menta,</HI> that we call,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Horat. 1. <HI>Ep.</HI> 19. <HI>Ius porcorum, pul|lorum, piscium, &amp; jus pulmentorum, Largissimas epu|las.</HI> Apuleius. <HI>Pulmentum pri|dem si eripait.</HI> Accius Plautus <HI>in</HI> Aulul. 9.37.</NOTE> water-grewel, pulse, or thin pottage, the dyet of poor people: to which <HI>Horace</HI> alludes, <HI>Canes ut pariter pulmenta laboribus empta</HI>; and that which <HI>Apuleius, Plautus,</HI> and others mention as thin dyet: this the Text sayes they do make hearty and strong with a small piece of lard of bacon, or, as I rather believe, by the lard of bacon in the broth, they so quat their stomachs that they make it go fur|ther by it; to this use of it <HI>Plautus</HI> alludes when he sayes, <HI>Ipse ego pulmenta utor un|ctiusculo</HI>; and for this use lard of bacon is fitly called <HI>Lard</HI> from <HI>arduo, quia ardor

<P>This disgression I have thought fit to make in relation to that sensibleness which good Princes have of their poor Subjects conditions, which surely they must needs relent at, who have Subjects dutifull to them, yet so miserable, that though they breed up flesh and dainties, hardly can keep on egg, the most trite thing about a Country, dwelling, for their own dainties, but are fain to crouch to the Souldiers that quarter with them to their undoing, so sayes the Text, the misery of the poor Peasant is, <HI>Vix ova eorum ipfis relinquuntur pro summis vescenda deliciis,</HI>

<P>This Clause presents the Nobless not sometimes very happy: for since Greatness is subject to temptation and Envy, both which are productive of Enemies, and Enemies contrivers of Accusations, and Accusations too often believed, and proceeded upon before the truth of things be throughly examined, greatness is even in <HI>France</HI> a thing of danger: for, who can be secure there, where his enemy may accuse, and he not be capable to defend himself juridickly; nay, how can innocence stand in judgement, if it may not be tryed <HI>per Pares,</HI> Persons of Honour, as the Peers of a Nation cannot but be presumed to be.

Common Law does so preserve to the owners Propriety, that no man can come upon his ground against his will but is a Trespasser; no man lodge in his house without his consent and against his declared minde but is punishable, and, as the case may be, a felon for so doing.

<P>THIS Chapter commences with a quotation from Saint <HI>Tho|mas,</HI> and from that little Tract of his,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cogitanti mihi quid offerrem Regia cel|situdini dignum meaque professioni congru|um &amp; officio, id occurrit potissime <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fferen|dum at Regi Regni de Regno conscrib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rem.

The first whereof is from the Authour <HI>Thomas Aquinas,</HI> whom the Text terms <HI>Sanctus Thomas,</HI> which title our Chancellour not onely gives him as he was sanctified by divine grace, and a Member of that mystical body of <HI>Christ,</HI> but as also this holy man was canonized by <HI>Pope Iohn</HI> the 22. about the year 1323. and that not so much for the piety of his life, as for that miracle which by invocation on him is pretended to be wrought on his decayed Niece. Now though this Canonization (to write gently of his <HI>Holiness</HI> and his <HI>Saintings</HI>) have some things in it, which in the design of them presume those that by it are (as far as it can) honoured; yet the many natural, religious, learned accomplishments he above the rest of his Con|temporaries had, render him semi-divine with me, though he were abstracted from his Registry in their <HI>Calendar</HI>; and these (amongst many others) are, First, His Origin was noble, <HI>Aquine</HI> in <HI>Campany,</HI> and from Parents in it, as some write, descended from the Earl of <HI>Apulia</HI> and the Kings of <HI>Sicily</HI>; or as others from the <HI>Lombard</HI>-Race, and that Earl of <HI>Aquine</HI> who lived in <HI>Charles the Great</HI>'s time about the year 800, which honour of his bloud and birth no doubt kindled him to great endeavours,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Autor vita San|cti</HI> Aquinatis.</NOTE> and to such expressions

Secondly, The prediction of his after-proof by an holy man, who, when his Mother was with childe with him, told her, She was with childe with one that would be most famous, adding his name, profession, addiction, and acceptation with God and the world, <HI>Nec res san|ctissimi viri mentem fefellit,</HI> saith his <HI>Biographer.</HI> Thirdly, His early entry upon se|rious study; for coming very young to <HI>Naples,</HI> he quickly mastered Logick and na|tural Philosophy, disputing so notably in them, that every one that heard him admi|red, and expected a sutable progress.

This, This, is the Saint <HI>Thomas,</HI> the Authour of the book quoted by our Text-Master.</P>
<P>The Book this matchless Authour wrote, was of the Government of Princes, a very high subject worthy his incomparable Genius, which made its nest with the stars,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Libri qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s de Regimine Principum ad</HI> Cypri <HI>regem conscripsit, ostendunt quod il|luc usque suarum virtutum fama, no|minisque reverentia penetraverit, quid au|tem libris illis huic Regi conscribendo oc|casionem prastiterit, nondum mihi comper|tum est, nisi quod crediderim suarum vir|tutum samam, gratum <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">um &amp; amicum tunc illi regi, tunc aliis multii ipsam red|didiss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Aut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r vitae ejus.</HI></NOTE> and thought triter Texts were beneath the Majesty of its endowment; that it was His, is praise enough to it, and that he wrote to a Prince of Princely qualities and offices, commends his prudence in so proportionate a choice: for surely he must have some rayes of a Princely minde in himself, who has the confidence to write to Princes of matters purely Princely, and to treat aptly and with counsel of those secrets which are lock'd up in the Cabinets of Gran|deur, and to which none can unsacrilegiously approach, but those that are pious, modest, loyal, and prudent; and such in every degree Saint <HI>Thomas</HI> therein approving himself, directed his thoughts to the then King of <HI>Cyprus.</HI> These things premised as emphatique in that our Chancellour here quotes out of him, we will humbly and in God's fear consider the particulars as they are pertinent to the order of our Commentary.</P>
<P><HI>Rex datur propter Regnum &amp; non Regnum propter Regem</HI>] This is a truth no wise man can, and no just Prince will deny; for God instituting Government in nature, which requires something regitive in every multitude, and having in that institution a regard to the generality of his creatures and the propagation of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Oportet esse in om|ni multitudine ali|quod regitivum. Lib.</HI> 1. <HI>c.</HI> 1.

For in that God gives one the Prerogative and Jurisdiction over multitudes of others, 'tis not as that one is such numerally, but as that One in number, is Many and All in dignity, as having a divine Vicarage in him, in the worth whereof he's worth 10000 of them, the Sun, Shield, Father, Oracle, the All of them. And hence, though true it be that the <HI>Philanthropy</HI> of God displays it self in putting the Many of his creatures under One for their good and profit, which is <HI>Rex datur propter Regnum</HI>;] yet true also it is, that though multitudes are not made for Holocausts to the rage of Princes, which is <HI>Non Regnum propter Reg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m</HI>] yet com|fort,

observances, and supports of Princes they are appointed to be, and Princes that love, govern, and discipline them deserve, <HI>ex opere operato,</HI> they should be such to them; and therefore God has endowed Princes not onely with such qualities as are at|tractive of Subjects loves, and have cogency on the wise and worthy of them, Justice and Generousness,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. Plato <HI>lib.</HI> 1. De Rep. <HI>p.</HI> 576.</NOTE> whereby their hearts are pleasingly and to their profit stolne from themselves and set on their Princes with resolutions of loyalty and reverence towards them; but also with such adjuments of extern terrour, as shall make the good safe in their fidelity, and the refractory punished for their mutiny and disorder. Now this Doctrine of the Text quoted out of <HI>Aquinas,</HI> all good Princes have in the sense of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> and all good Authours owned, especially our own; so is the sense of the Preamble to the 1 <HI>E.</HI> 6. <HI>c.</HI> 12. shewing, that Princes as Fathers are to make Lawes best suting to the tempers of their people and to the time of their Reigns: so King <HI>Iames of blessed memory</HI> acknowledged the duty of Kings in those words,<NOTE PLACE="marg">K. <HI>Iames</HI> in his book of <HI>The true Law of Free Mo|narchies.</HI> p. 195. of his Works in folio.</NOTE> <HI>As a loving father and carefull watch-man, caring for them more then for himself, knowing himself to be ordained for them, and they not for him; and therefore countable to that great God who placed him as his Lieutenant over them, upon the peril of his soul, to procure the weale of both souls and bodies, as far as in him lyeth of all them that are committed to his charge,</HI> &amp;c. not to encourage their Subjects petulancy and peremptoriness, (<HI>For though Princes are so generous that their Subjects cannot ask more then they can give, yet Princes may reserve to themselves the incommunicable Iewel of their conscience,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eicon.

And therefore Kings being as Angels, <HI>Dati &agrave; divina bo|nitate propter homines, non solum Christianos, sed &amp; Gentiles, &amp; cujuscunque generis atque conditionis,</HI> as <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.

And therefore this position is true in its just and prudent sense, in which onely our Text-Master quotes it, and I after him discourse on it; for in the <HI>Anabaptistique</HI> and <HI>Iesuitique</HI> sense of ju|dicial power in multitudes over their supreme Magistrates, 'tis treasonous, execrable, irreligious, anti-scriptural; 'tis all that is pestilent to Monarchies, dishonourable to Religion, and every way unsafe for the sacred persons of Princes. Concerning these things then, I having written in my Notes on the 13, 14, and 15. Chapters of this Book, I shall pursue it here no further, onely pray, <HI>That Princes and People may ever keep close to the Lawes of their Sovereignty and Subjection</HI>; for otherwise, <HI>Nulla est secu|ritas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 1. <HI>c</HI> 2.

<P>Here the Chancellour shews, that as the Mastery men act over themselves, is more noble then that they can over others; so the weakness men expresse in being con|quered by their lawless wills and reasonless passions, is more notorious and defamatory then to be victor'd by an Adversary: and this he applies in the reason of it to Prin|ces in order to themselves and their Subjects; for God having endowed them with di|vine souls, and with Authority over their Subjects, men in common nature with them, and to whom they as Fathers, Shepherds, and Guardians ought to evidence them|selves; for such to sauciate and exhaust them, and by a leontine voracity to consume them and theirs, and all to bring their Wills to be the Law, and their pleasures the Iron-Saw by which they hackle the persons, fortunes, and freedoms of their poor Vas|sals,

Now this impuissance our Chancellour layes down as God's punishment of vice, which so allayes the soul, that by un|innocencing it, leaves onely in it a pavidness and irresolution to any act of Heroickness, that look as an unchaste wife cannot comfort herself against all the infirmities of life and crosses of her Marriage state, That she has a good conscience to God and her Husband, whom by disloyalty she has not abused; so a Prince that is never pleased better then when he by negligence reduces himself to straits, and then mercilesly relieves them upon his Subjects, <HI>Depilati|one subditorum</HI>] frequently; not once and away, but to such a pro|portion as it may be said, <HI>Depauperat subditos</HI>:] and to suffer his Subjects so to be made miserable by it, as <HI>Nec sinet vivere, &amp; sus|tentari propriis substantiis.</HI>] Surely thus to put the Yoke of servitude on Subjects, to gratifie the licentious Insubjection of the Prince's Soul to Reason and Religion, seems to bode ill to any Prince that is guilty of it. And therefore<NOTE PLACE="marg">Herodotus <HI>lib.</HI> 3. <HI>Hist.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Praxaspes, Cambyses</HI> his favourite did friendlyly by his Master, whom, when he saw <HI>Persianly</HI> luxurious and rubi|fied by an high and ranting compotation, he with civil affection and majesty of prudence, admonished him from reiterating such a King|less jovialty, telling him, <HI>That Kings, who are the Chiefs of Na|tions, on whom all their eyes are, and after whose examples they all do, ought to be wary what they do, least by an ill President they undoe thou|sands of their Subjects</HI>; for one ill example shall more pervert then many good Lawes can rectifie. And therefore one of the most Kingly qualities, that mortality is capable of, is <HI>Self-Mastery,</HI> because where that is endeavoured by us, and from God consolidated to us, we are able to keep our pro|spect into things clear, and not judge by the false Glasses of extremes, which magni|fie or diminish, multiply or lessen, as our addictions to those vices are more or lesse prevalent, or intense: for still judgement being obfuscated, our power is transferred to that we are enjoyed by,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Potens etiam non solum &agrave; possum verbo. verum etiam &agrave; potior deducitur.</HI> Turneb. <HI>lib.</HI> 29. <HI>c.</HI> 24.</NOTE> which is the victor|lust. Therefore where ever wisdom resides in Princes, I mean not onely cathedrally but personally, there is in those Princes a con|stant study to keep free from all Preoccupations;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Non enim me cuiquam mancipavi, nul|lius nomen fero, multorum magnorum viro|rum judicio credo, aliquid &amp; meo vindico.</HI> Senec. <HI>Ep.</HI> 45.</NOTE> and so to ascribe to others, as not to exclude themselves the liberty to consider and judge what they themselves are to doe.

By this then it ap|pears that our Law considering, and our Princes willing themselves to be considered politick Monarchs, whose Soveraigntyes admit mixtures of paternity to them, did onely intend such practice of power over their subjects as should render them able to support themselves by their subjects, and willing (their subjects in such subjecti|on to them) to preserve in the free use of what God, Nature and Industry had made theirs. This is the sense of all that the Chancellour doth or can write on this argument, for the glory of a King is to be <HI>Liber</HI> in his Prerogative, and <HI>Potens</HI> in his Subjects; so is the King by his, How?

<P>This is added to shew that the absolute power of Kings, if just, is much more tole|rable and to be admired, then that, which under the pretext of it, is practiced by some that rule by it; for if there were a consideration of Subjects as the Mines and Quarries out of which the gold and silver of Princes incomes must be fetched, and they were by Princes studied and secured, that so they might the more safely bring their rich ladings to the Port of their Princes Exchequer, and having paid their duty there, make the most (with their Prince's blessing and good will) of what is theirs neat and clear, as by the rules of Justice under the absolutest Monarch in the world they ought, then would they have encouragement to blesse God and their Prince for the mercy of a Government, which did thus permit them to be happy under the Allegiance and Ju|stice of it. For it is not the strictness of Government associated with Justice, that makes Subjects grieved and discontented, (no more then the vigilant eye of a prudent husband over his beloved wife makes her discomposed, for this being an argument of a wise minde to keep her to himself, and to prevent all bold attempts upon her (in the negation of which chiefly lyes that sexes security) is the great argument of her virtu|ous gratitude and resolved loyalty to him) but that which offends Subjects, and makes them entertainers of fears and cross humours, is not <HI>ex Legis defectu</HI>] want of a right rule to walk by, (for that the Law of Nature and Nations prescribes to every man, who more or less has the Principles of it legible in his minde) but the grievance is,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vbi jam sum ista regula, ubi quid sit justum ab injustis cogn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">scitur; ubi descri|pta sunt, nisi in libris illius lucis qua ve|ritas dicitur, ubi lex omnis ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tae describitur, &amp; in cor hominis qui operatur justitiam: non migrando sed tanquam imprimendo transfertur, sicat imago annuli ex an|nul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> Sanctus Augustin. <HI>lib.</HI> 14. <HI>De Ci|vitate Dei.</HI> c. 15.</NOTE> in the distorted will and the loose affections of the Go|vernour, who, regardless of the main ends of Government, Justice, and National Prosperity, launches out into the Ocean of pleasure, and in the endearings of them (not onely drenched but drowned) looses all thoughts of that distributive Regality, which from the in|tentness of a real greatness and virtuous care of and conscience to Subjects, ought to be manifested; which <HI>Seneca</HI> found true in <HI>Nero,</HI> and thence was bold to tell the World, <HI>That Tyrants and Kings differ not so much in their outward appearance of State,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quid interest inter Tyrannum &amp; Regem; specie enim ipsa, fortuna, as licentia par est, nisi quod Tyranni voluptate s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">viunt, Reges non nisi ex causa &amp; necesiitate, lib.</HI> 1.

<P>This has several parts of its answer worthy consideration, First, that the <HI>primus con|cubitus</HI> was a sin, because a violation of chastity and an act of lust and irregular concupi|scence; for it being not an observance of the institution of God, nor to the end of prolification, (which though it happeneth unexpectedly to be, yet was not the end of the coition, but meerly the effect of brutish sensuality, which titillated the concupiscence to acts of inordinacy, and took the object it first lusted as the creature of its pleasure, not the beloved and solitary object of its adhesion,) there being no end of God in the institution of Marriage designedly promoted thereby, no blessing of God on such conjunction can be expected there-from, though the patience of God forbear punish|ment of such a sin against his Law, the breach whereof this act was, and does not in the very act destroy the sinner; yet is the sin entered on record in heaven and without repentance is damnable: and therefore the <HI>subsequens Matrimonium</HI> does not purge that, for then the remedy must antidate it self and work before it had a being, then it must be either in its own nature, or in God's acceptance of equivalence with guilt|lesseness, for else how can it purge from the guilt of sin committed, not that then can it do, but all that it can do is to mitigate scandal and to give restitution in point of fame, as thereby it imports to the world, that there was an inclination and addiction of them to a Marriage completion,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A contrahentibus publicata Matri|monia olim valida.

<Q><P>Dicunt etiam quod peccati illius conscii, tanto minus inde poenitent, quo Leges trans|gressoribus illis favere desiderant.</P></Q>
<P>This is a sure consequence, as impenitency arises from obcaecation and sin not dis|covered: so impudence and confirmation in sin, from sin by Law not censured or dis|allowed; for the rule being, <HI>Quod non vetat Lex, id mandat,</HI> if there be not a notori|ous manifest of the Lawes displeasure, the corruption of mortal nature will thence de|rive an encouragement to commit and justifie it. And therefore the Lawes of our Nation having the Lawes of God for their Original and Exemplar, do according to it justifie themselves to claim obedience from men, because they enjoyn those moral and just acts that the Law of God does, which is, <HI>That every man shall enjoy his own wife and every woman her own husband,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. <HI>Heb.</HI> 13.4.</NOTE> <HI>because Whore-mongers and Adulterers God will judge</HI>; And that whatsoever is beside or against the honour and loyalty of Marriage, is a breach of the Divine Law, and a Trespass upon the Civil Magistrate the Keeper of both Tables, by which these Lawes retain their Majesty and worth, <HI>Cum Lex sit san|ctio sancta, jubeus honesta &amp; prohibens contraria,</HI>] as the Text saith: while they do by no connivance at the sin make the sin either little or none at all, and so tacitely invite to the Commission of it. And this our Chancellour gives as the reason of the Law a|gainst Legitimation upon subsequent Marriage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philo <HI>lib. de Spe cialibus Legibus.</HI> p. 780.</NOTE> because if this should be allowed, all vageness of fruition would be practised, and unless issue come which they neither ex|pect nor welcome who are lustfully acted, never subsequent Marriage would be. There|fore the Law to honour and establish Marriage, necessitates persons to be in that state, if they would have their issue descendable to estate or bloud.</P>

<P>This is here introduced to shew the reason of man's dotage on generation-enjoy|ments, 'tis because the good of being ever he cannot obtain, (his body being ele|mentary, mixed, and so dissolvable) his great drift is to contribute to the being of his kinde, though by it he pay the death and determination of his person; for though the life of man be dear to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iob.</HI> 2.4.</NOTE> <HI>skin for skin,</HI> that is, one part of his substance after ano|ther 'till all be exhaust, <HI>will a man give for his life:</HI> yet to be a benefactour to suc|cession in prolification is that which preponderates life, and more natural and noble is it for man to carry on the succession of man by generation, then to enjoy individual life if it were possible to a perpetuation, because the one is but a solitary good, the other a diffusive and general one; which <HI>Abraham</HI> no mean Artist in nature as well as in piety apprehending,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gen.</HI> 15.2.</NOTE> complaints to God, that all he had, did him no good <HI>since he went childeless,</HI> as conceiving, he lived not at all to the purpose of nature who had not generative energy, or having it, expressed it not; nor did he seem to himself fa|voured by the God of nature, whose natural endowment orderly expended brought no harvest to succession. Now though I am apt to think there was some sensual instinct that impresses this desire and urges on this impetuosity of man; yet do I not believe but that some ambition of a temporal eternity as pledge of assimilation to the first cause (in a degree and apprehension of perpetuity, and as it were indeterminateness of being) acts man to this: &amp; God having furnished him with soulary powers to it, proportionates corporal Organs to those offices of life and activity, <HI>Vnde fit quod plus delectatur homo in sensu tactus, quo servatur species ejus, quam in sensu gustus.</HI>] <HI>The Senses of man are the deficient participations of Intellect,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sensus est quadam deficiens participa|tio Intellectus.</HI> Sanct.

For reasonable it is, that he that has the power of an estate should settle it as he pleases, and to those he best judges to deserve, which certainly those must by any reasonable man be judged to be who are his children, though not legitimate, he having none such, yet natural, and such he having. Which I write not in the least degree to apologize for looseness which I hate, or to dishonour Marriage by the benefit of which (I bless God) I have been happy in a serene life and an hopefull issue; but to dissallow that execrable oblivion and sordid folly, which too much swayes with wanton and wilde persons, who first sin against God in begetting children in vage lust, and then sin against their own bo|dies, in disowning such support of the fruit of them, as they are able in point of estate to allow.

This is that which brands her and disables her son to in|herite, which so boyles in the stomach of this blazing star of lust, that he meditates the ruine of all his fathers lawfull sons.</P>
<P>In which story there are sundry things observable. First, There is the Bastards craft, he enters not on the act alone without a strong party, nor craves aid of any that would come in to him, but solicits the <HI>Sichemites,</HI> whom he calls <HI>his Kindred, Bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, The Bastard's confidence to attack the <HI>Sichemites</HI> and to solicite them to such a design, and so to engage them by his plausible insinuations, as not onely they should connive at and underhand approve his project, but give him money to enter|tain men to effect it, <HI>Chap.</HI> ix. 4.</P>
<P>Thirdly, The Bastard's cruelty to slay so near relations, Brethren, so many of them, sixty nine; in that place, their father's house; at one time, upon one stone, in sight of one another, upon no provocation, but because they were legitimate and must in|herit, not he. <HI>v.</HI> 4. compared with <HI>v</HI> 2. and 6.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Here is the Bastard's subtlety, rage, and cruelty, partly frustrated by God, and his fancyed Sovereignty disturbed by the reservation of <HI>Iotham</HI> one of <HI>Gi|deon</HI>'s sons unslain, whom God preserved to revenge the bloud of the sixty nine slain, upon the Bastard and his <HI>Sichemites,</HI> from the 7. to the 24. <HI>vers.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly, The effectualness of small means cunningly carryed and subtlely imployed to bring portentuous things to passe, seen not onely in <HI>Abimelech</HI> his sin in soliciting the <HI>Sichemites,</HI> and murthering the sixty nine sons of his father, but in <HI>Iotham</HI>'s Pa|rable, who set all <HI>Israel</HI> a-gog to revenge the fratricide purely by the cogency of a Pa|rable and the intention of it, which explicates the falseness and ingratitude of the <HI>Si|chemites</HI> to <HI>Gideon</HI> their Deliverer, <HI>v.</HI> 8. and prophecies God's vengeance on them for it, <HI>v.</HI> 19, 20. and God's means to unravell the rope of sand that they twined together to hold their wickedness fast, by sending an evil spirit between <HI>Abimelech</HI> and the men of <HI>Sichem, v.</HI> 23.</P>
<P>Lastly, The commensuration of the punishment to the sin, rule he would who was born to serve, ruine his brethren he would who ought to have reverenced them as his betters, Partizans he would have in the fact, that having begun he may go through with it; but God turned his Confederates into conspirators against him, that the cru|elty done to the threescore and ten sons of <HI>Ierubaal</HI> might come, and their bloud be

layd upon <HI>Abimelech</HI> their brother which slew them, and upon the men of <HI>Sichem</HI> which ayded him in the killing of his brethren, so is it <HI>v.</HI> 24. Thus may we see how just God is to make the sin men design for their greatness, their shame and diminu|tion; which not onely happened to this Bastard and his misguized Partizans here, but to sundry others to this day; For though it be not an infallible rule that Gods vengeance alwayes meets with sinners in this world, in the punishments that are declarative of their sin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Surius <HI>Commen|tar. ad Annum</HI> 1541.</NOTE> yet often it is so.

<P>That this blindman was of old held a Bastard, was not only the opinion of the Ancients who wrote before our Text, and the beleif of many Christians according to it; but also the consent of <HI>Grotius, Pererius</HI> and others, and that because he is said to be <HI>totut natus in peccato, a Toting sinner,</HI> as we say, a monstrous great sinner, such an one as has not only the blemish of his genitors naturall sin, in which all the sons of <HI>Adam</HI> are concei|ved and born, but an over and above-sin upon him, not only of the nature, but also of the state which his Parents who begat him were dishonourably in,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Incomparably Learned Doctor <HI>Hammond</HI> in his Annotations on this Text 9. <HI>Iohn.</HI></NOTE> to wit, not the state of marriage which has the presence and allowance of God with it, and thereupon being a kind of sinless and <HI>Innocent state is honourable among all men,</HI> but a state of contempt and sculkingness, a lucifugous state, which is that of the night, a state of prey and vio|lence, that derives on the procede of it, the reproach and scorn of a thorough and to|tall turpitude.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. 4. <HI>de Finib.</HI> 2.

For as sin is that which promerits a divine curse and impends it over Kingdoms sure to sink under the weight and terrour of it; so Lawes in Kingdoms which do <HI>cast forth the abomina|ble thing that God hates,</HI> and preserve the integrity of soul which God accepts and will reward, are certainly the most to be approved and chosen.

<P>THIS whole Chapter, as the 41. is onely serviceable to the compleatness of the Dialogue, and to the vehiculation of the Chancellour's design to that perfection, which his aim (through the mediation of providential advantages well observed and improved) promised him to arrive at; for though many men and things properly fitted and industriously followed do not attain what, in the enterprises of their actours mindes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In corpus huma|num pars divini spiritus mersa.</HI> Se|nec. <HI>Ep.</HI> 66. <HI>ar|bitria bonorum &amp; malorum Ep.</HI> 7<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>Ep.</HI> 92. <HI>lib.</HI> 2. <HI>De Benefic. c.</HI> 8. <HI>&amp;</HI> 4. <HI>De Ben. c.</HI> 10.</NOTE> they are studious to dispose themselves and their endeavours towards: yet so long as reason, which <HI>Seneca</HI> calls, <HI>A portion of divinity, sunk and lodged in us, and that which leads the creatures and follows the Gods in the wisdom and conduct of it,</HI> so long, I say, as reason swayes men, they are well guided, and probable to arrive at the law|full issue they expect. This being the Chancellour's argument in the personated Prince, that he makes it <HI>omnis honesti comes,</HI> and thence concludes on the Law of <HI>Englands</HI> side, is but what he has throughout this Treatise done, and which he thinks the Lawes of <HI>England</HI> deserve: and that because they do not onely shew themselves just to give to every one their due, that will sue to them for right, but establish right to innocent and impotent babes that are not able to help themselves. And hereupon the rule of reason and Law is, as here quoted, <HI>Odia perstringi &amp; favores convenit ampli|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ri</HI>] which is the rule of the Civilians,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>Digest. <HI>lib.</HI> 4. <HI>tit.</HI> 4.

Now the law in this is not more jealous then wise, nor more vigilant then rational; for there no greater villanies have been acted in the world then those who from hopes to gain by their success have been encouraged to act them, <HI>This is the heir lets kil him that the inheritance may be ours,</HI> was the cursed combination of the evil terre-tenants in the Gospel parable,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A friend that is near, is better then a brother that is far off</HI></NOTE> nor are any acts of truculency more tran|scendently horrible then those that have been acted by, or connived at by relations of bloud and kindred; Were not <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Abel</HI> brothers, yet <HI>Cain</HI> who should have been his brothers keeper was his butcher?

And who considers that not only falsehoods in friendships but even in brother-hoods are frequent, and that it was <HI>Reuben</HI> who vitiated his Fathers Concubines, and <HI>Absalom</HI> that intruded his Fathers Throne, and <HI>Amnon</HI> that stuprated his own Sister, and <HI>Zimri</HI> that slew his Master, will conclude, <HI>that mens enemies are often those of their own house</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Theatr. vita hu|mans p.</HI> 1646.</NOTE> nor shall men readilyer finde greater fallacies, and more real ruines from any then from false Brothers, and perfidious Uncles, the confirmation of which <HI>Zuinger</HI> has collected in the instances of <HI>Danaus</HI> to his bro|ther <HI>Egiptus, Xerxes</HI> to <HI>Masistes, Horatius Romanus</HI> to <HI>Curiatius, Atila</HI> to <HI>Buda, Vitiosa</HI> to <HI>Theofred, Gondebald</HI> to <HI>Childeric, Perinus Fregrose</HI> to his brother <HI>Ni|cholas</HI> with many others, but above all, the enmity of <HI>Zaringensis</HI> Prince of <HI>Carinthia</HI> to his kindred, is notable, which he dying expressed by <HI>willing that all his plate, jewels, and utensels of worth might be gathered together to provoke his Kindred to fight, and stay one another about the obtaining of it,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Idom p.</HI> 2174. 2375. 3406.

he dreaded trouble, and at last ascends the Throne; Which nefarious fact ratifies the reason of the Law, to commit the heir to none that by the miscariage of it can possibly inherit, but to the next kindred of the contrary side, who may be presumed to have affection enough to perform a trust, and not any temptation from advantage arising to him to forfeit and betray it.</P>
<Q><P>Sed si hereditas illa non in socagio, sed teneatur per servitium militare, tunc per leges terra illius, infans ipse &amp; baereditas ejus, non per agnatos neque per cognatos, sed per dominum feodi illius custodientur, quousque ipse fuerit aetatis viginti &amp; unius annorum.</P></Q>
<P>This is added to shew, that as there are men of arts and arms in every Nation, so there are tenures and services by which these men hold lands in order to peace and warr, arts and arms; having therefore in the former clause declared, how the infants of socagers, which are men of the plough and plain, are secured during their minori|ty, he proceeds to evidence, how the infants of the more noble Tenurers, who hold by military service are provided for, and those he sayes are to be kept by the Lords of the fees, of whom they hold their estates, and to whose persons they in warr, when a|ble, are to do service.</P>
<P><HI>Per servitium militare</HI>] Here the Chancellour passes over lands held by Homage Ancestrel, because, though the custody is the same with those in Escuage and Serje|antry, which are the military services here, yet perhaps there was at the time of our Chancellours writing little land held by Homage Ancestrel, both Lords and Tenants altering and changing, and the land nor continuing in the bloud of Lords and Tenants as by the precise nature and rule of that tenure ought.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Escuagia a scuto quo militare dicun|tur,</HI> Bracton <HI>lib.</HI> 2. <HI>c.</HI> 36. <HI>scutagi|am dicitur quod talis prastatio per|tinet ad scutum quod aessumitus, &amp; servitium militare dicitur. lib.</HI> 1. <HI>c.</HI> 14.

<P><HI>Honestate morum</HI>] By this I think the Chancellour intends <HI>Fair condition and civil deportment,</HI> that kindeness and truth of conversation which excludes all elation and falsehood, and abhorrs mixtures of fraud and levity with that which seems amiable and worthy in men. This <HI>Plato</HI> is so precise in, <HI>That though he expects not men should be irreprebensible, yet he would have them that would be accounted honest to do no evil pre|mediately, and for the once as we say.</HI> This <HI>Honesty</HI> the <HI>Philosopher</HI> calls, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>the good of justice,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>the victory and honour of all good men and good things,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>the utmost procedure of virtue, beyond which nothing by man can be acted here on earth.</HI> This Pleonasm to the honour of <HI>Honesty,</HI> the <HI>Mo|ralist</HI> gives the reason of, <HI>'Tis no mortal Principle that moves to Honesty of manners,</HI> but a consideration of God above, and conscience within and men without, all Supervi|sors or Judges of our Behaviours. Upon this ground the Ancients mate the most noble virtues and rewards with <HI>Honest as, Tully</HI> joyns <HI>Dignitas</HI> with <HI>Honestas,</HI> and writes of <HI>Honestatem &amp; decus conservare,</HI> and <HI>Honestatibus partis &amp; omni dignitate privare</HI>; thus <HI>Honest a dicta, nonestus dies, nonesta virgo, nonesta forma, nenesto loco natus, nonesta arma, nonesti exitus, nomen nonestum, mors nonesta,</HI> are so frequent to express the best of excellencies by, that there is no doubt but our Chancellour by <HI>morum nonestate</HI>] means the best and most unspotted accomplishments of generousness, blamelessness of life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Offic. c.</HI> 8. <HI>Lib.</HI> 3. <HI>c.</HI> 4.19. <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> En|chyrid. <HI>lib.</HI> 4. <HI>c.</HI> 2. <HI>p.</HI> 380.</NOTE> and exemplarity of conversation, <HI>Honest as turpitudini vitae contraria,</HI> as <HI>Tully</HI> and <HI>Quintilian</HI> often mention them. This Saint <HI>Paul</HI> calls <HI>walking circumspectly and in|offensively,</HI> and <HI>Epictetus, A freedom and friendship with God, which</HI> (saith he) <HI>God expects I should walk worthy of; for he has not given me in charge adorning my body, or getting a great estate, or an honourable fame, but he has commanded me upon the penalty of his disfavour and his abhorrence and rejection of me, to be sober and solid, to live orderly and conform to the moral Dictates of reason, avoiding all turpitude as the dis|luster of his image in me.</HI> Indeed, next to that we <HI>Christians</HI> call <HI>Grace,</HI> this <HI>Honesty of manners</HI> is to be valued and endeavoured; for it not onely keeps from every ex|treme, but carryes on and continues in such a direct line of mediocrity, as is glori|ous to behold and imitate: and therefore is so much the more to be pressed on great men, because they are so apt to love and practise licentiousness, and are by it so influential to mislead the meaner sort, that without it prevail over them, all good Virtue and Order is like to be discarded the World. For my part, I think so|briety and civility of Manners and Garb the great Ornament of Nobility and Gen|try, and conclude,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philostratus <HI>in vita</HI> Apollonii. <HI>lib.</HI> 4. <HI>c.</HI> 10. <HI>p.</HI> 190.</NOTE> as <HI>Apollonius Tyanaeus</HI> did of <HI>Sparta, They doe,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp;c. <HI>extend their glory to the Heavens by it,</HI> and in the failer of it, <HI>E|clipse and drownd them,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>not onely in the Sea but on the Land.</HI> The consideration of which made <HI>Pliny,</HI> that grave Au|thour, brand the Aedility of <HI>Marcus Scaurus,</HI> with mischief to the Common|wealth, because it introduced new toyes into it, to the dishonour and abolition of the old fashions and manners.

This is to become <HI>A man without welt or gard, the same he seems to be,</HI> and this is the noblest end of generous education. And this our Chancellour sayes young Lords and Gentlemen are probabler to have abroad then at home, and in the Lord's Houses rather then in their father's house, because 'tis <HI>Altior nobiliorque Curia,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P>Yet the Law of <HI>England</HI> is otherwise, for though it hate Ingratitude, ranking it a|mongst those sins which are in the very forlorn and main <HI>Battalia</HI> of Hell; yet when servitude was in being with us, it punished it not with reduction to servitude, be|cause that is an undoing what the Law has done, and a playing fast and loose with the states and conditions of men, which are bond while manumission, and after that con|tinue free. And perhaps our Law is so consistent in this, from the apprehension it has
<PB N="513" REF="268">
of God's abhorrence of the <HI>Iews</HI> cruelty and hypocrisie in <HI>Ieremiah</HI>'s time; for God having commanded them <HI>that every man should let his man-servant,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ier.</HI> 34.10.</NOTE> <HI>and every man his maid servant go free, that none should serve themselves of them any more,</HI> which they o|beyed, and let them goe: <HI>But afterwards</HI> (sayes the Text) <HI>they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let goe free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for hand-maids</HI>; which act of recess from their lenity and justice to their servants, God took so ill, that he for it, <HI>Proclaimed Liberty for them, to the Sword, to the Pestilence, and to the Famine, and I will make you to be re|moved into all the Kingdoms of the earth,</HI> vers. 17. By which sad return of their cruelty and unmercyfulness, we are told that God loves no double dealing, but delights in righteousness persisted in, and mercy thoroughly extended. And this I suppose may be some ground of the reason of the Law, which manumits once for all; for if the Lord does enfranchise his Villain, he must be free, revillain'd he cannot be, <HI>Because the Lord's act shall be construed most forcibly against himself:</HI> and no new Villainage can be made,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sect.</HI> 172. <HI>c.</HI> 11.</NOTE> <HI>licet gratus vel ingratus sit Libertinus,</HI> saith our Text.

<P><HI>Alii quoque sunt hujusmodi casus,</HI> &amp;c.] These and sundry other cases there are wherein the variation of the Lawes do evidence themselves; but the Quotation of these, as the Chancellour, so his humble Commentator enlarges not upon, because they are not of very great moment, nor require any elaboration in the treaty of them, but onely serve to the compleatness of the Dialogue, in which the Prince is introduced by our Text- Master in the following words.</P>

Chapter shewed the discrepancy of the Civil and Common Lawes in determination of Theft and Enfranchisement, in which he con|ceives the Common Lawes to be more terrible to Theft and more indulgent to freedom then the Civil Lawes are.

The mind of man being restless, and chosing rather employment, then musing, antiquity invented the disports of Dice and Ball. These dice are by the <HI>Latines</HI> termed <HI>Tali,</HI> from <HI>Talus</HI> the anckle bone of the foot, or the postern bone of a beast, of which, they were wont to make these Dice; whence our Proverb, when one will act cruelty on a man, they are said, <HI>to make Dice of his bones</HI>: this is near of kin, in the nature of the word to that game of Cock-all, which boyes use amongst us, which Cock-all, is as much as <HI>win and take all,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Proprie ludus in facto, ut jocus in verbis non seriis.</HI> L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur.

This is Cock-all; hence <HI>Talorum ludi,</HI> is that cast of the dice that carries the game and wager. Now these <HI>Talorum ludi</HI> are things of factive, as the other were of verbal recreation, and <HI>Tully commends them, when moderately and without injurie to grave things</HI>; and surely though 'tis good to keep the minde alwayes well employed, and the less levities doe avocate men from serious thoughts the better is the heart made: yet harmeless and decent recreations, whereby release is given to those austerites, is very necessary and lawful, and not to doe it, is a kinde of homicide and self-felony. For as God in point of duty commands us no more, then we (if we will put our selves out to the utmost) are enabled to doe, nor in point of suffering, layes no more upon us then we are able to beare; so men ought not to be more vexatious to themselves, and put greater bur|thens and harder lawes of restraint on themselves, then may consist with the hilarity, as well as sincerity of piety. And therefore, though I am no delighter in these luso|ry recreations, but notwithstanding my general and long converse with men of all Ages, fashions, addictions, sciences, am yet designedly and in prosequution of a long determined resolution, a novice in, and stranger to all play, being wholly ignorant of the termes, method and delight of it, and i hope as happy in, and as contented with the ignorance and unsurprisedness of it as any Infant is, or as the most captivated lover of it is with the witchery of it; yet doe I not disapprove the recreation that persons of worth and wisdome take in it, but rather believe it as wisely and worthily by them used, to be harmeless and practicable.

<P>This is added to shew the force and influence of use and habituation, in that it works another nature in men, which is the reason wise Law-givers have cautioned against ill customs and habits, as the great <HI>Apollyons</HI> of grave and good manners. For the na|ture of man being prone to evil, and endeared to the object of its familiar intuition and converse, does not onely at first civilly bear, and friendlyly affect what it so fami|liarly meets with, but at last passionately dotes on even to a delight of surprise by that it so is acquainted with and accustomed to. Which God, who knew the heart of <HI>Is|rael</HI> better then they did their own, foreseeing to be the sin of them under their cap|tivity to the Nations,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lev.</HI> 18.30.</NOTE> to whom their sins were penally to bring them, forewarns them not to follow the Statutes of abomination which were set before them: God has told them, that because of the evil customs and practices of the Nations, he had made their Land <HI>spew them out,</HI> vers. 26, 27. and because <HI>Israel</HI> that came into their Land, and with whom some of the Inhabitants would be left, whom they mingling and treating with, might be intangled in the love of their Idolatry and Immorality; therefore does he forewarn them to keep close to their directory, his Law, and not to observe the <HI>Statutes of Abominations,</HI> that is, such customs as by continuance has obtained the re|putation and authority of a Law, and therefore were <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Abominations to God,</HI> because practices against his Law and the Prescripts of nature, which he calls <HI>vain,</HI> Jer. 10.3. because they entertain men in their appearance without any reall satisfaction of or reward to them for their confidence.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. <HI>Hist.

Of this sort besides many others were those customs of <HI>Rome</HI> to sanctuary Thieves and promulgate lewdness, which <HI>Socrates</HI> sayes were used many hundred years till <HI>Theo|dosius</HI> exploded them. Hereupon as all Law-givers have enjoyned severity of man|ners, so have they looked upon avoidance of converse with and neighbourhood to evil, as the best means to preservation of good manners; for vices come into credit by use, and fashions into request by example and practice: so did the <HI>Ambitus</HI> for Magistra|cy among the <HI>Romans,</HI> for though begging of Votes made servile Magistrates, who did sordid and wicked things, yet when the <HI>Lex Ambitus</HI> came to reform this ill use; it found notable opposition and was decryed, many Factions appearing for it because it had long been in use. So is it in the most enormous things Storyes acquaint us with, and therefore more probable it is in things of indifferent nature, as playing for recre|ation is; yet by them sayes the Text is the <HI>French</HI> terms of play and account kept to our Chancellours, and to this day.</P>

Therefore, since long custome had rivetted <HI>French</HI> terms and forms into use in forming of Writs and Entryes of books concerning them, the Statute not directing its inhibition to work on those, men and time conspired to continue them as to this day they are, and that I think to keep the Law more secret from the insolence and arrogance of the illiterate and vulgar, who, did they understand these terms of art, or were they so explicated to them as use and business renders them to the learned, they would take upon them to value the Law less, or to understand more then they do, or then consists with their subjection to it, or their charity with their Neighbours; which I think is the reason why that Declaration of <HI>November</HI> 1650. <HI>That all Report-books of the Resolution of Iudges, and other books of the Law of</HI> England <HI>shall be translated into the</HI> English <HI>tongue;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Scobells <HI>Collecti|ons,</HI> p. 148, 149.</NOTE> <HI>and that all Writs, Processes, Returns,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>shall be in the</HI> English <HI>tongue, and not in the</HI> Latine <HI>or</HI> French, being not <HI>more Majorum,</HI> is obsoleted by the introduction of the old Method, of which our Text sayes, <HI>Plus proprie placitantur in</HI> Gallico <HI>quam in</HI> Anglico; and the Declarations upon Original Writs, <HI>tam connenienter ad naturam illorum pro|nunciare nequeunt.</HI>]</P>

<P>The use of <HI>Latine</HI> was probably introducted by the Clergy, when sundry of the Bishops and others of the Spiritualty were Judges and chief Officers in the Kings Courts of Law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Instit. <HI>p.</HI> 304.</NOTE> as from after the Conquest to the middle of <HI>Edw.</HI> 3. time they in a good measure were.

<P>This clause recollects the force of all the Premises, and answers the Quaere, <HI>Why the Lawes of</HI> England <HI>were not taught in the Vniversities of</HI> England <HI>as well as the Lawes Civil are,</HI> to wit, because the Civil Lawes are originally writ in the learned Lan|guages, which are common to all Scholes and Scholars, and without which the Arts cannot be attained; and the <HI>Latine</HI> tongue being there publickly spoken, (for the <HI>solum</HI> referrs to the place not to the tongue, as if onely <HI>Latine</HI> were there spoken and exercised and no other learned language, for <HI>Greek, Hebrew,</HI> and other languages are, in the same sense the <HI>Latine</HI> is, exercised therein:) but therefore it is said <HI>solum lingua Latina,</HI> because the <HI>Latine</HI> tongue is therein more used in discourse and exer|cise then any other tongue there, or in any other place of the Nation is, Exercises in <HI>Latine</HI> being as it were entailed to the Scholes, and fixed to the Freehold of the Uni|versities, for thither all persons of learning repairing, and there staying to study, thereby merit their degrees. And as all wits and perfections of promptness are there presumed to be; so all Exercises, Authors, and Dexterities in Art are also, which is the reason that the Universities have the onely opportunities to institute youth in mat|ters of speculation into Arts and Languages. And therefore the Lawes of Nations, <HI>The Civil Law,</HI> being in the <HI>Latine</HI> tongue, and being the Law of the Continent, which a Professor of it may practise and own in any part of the <HI>Christian</HI> and civilized World, (when as the Common Law is but a Topique Law, and serves onely for a municipe purpose, being thereupon writ in a municipe language) is proper to be taught in the Universities, and has degrees and honours therein, when our Common and Statute-Lawes have none there.</P>

<P>This Clause introduces the discourse of the famous Societies of the Law, called <HI>The Inns of Court.</HI> Of which to write to the proportion of their Augustness is alto|gether impossible for any man, who has so little help to their illustration, as (for ought I see) the learned and generous Professors of them are enabled to communicate to him that has a desire to blazon the Beauty, Antiquity, and Accommodation of them. I confess my hopes and expectations were to have found much assistance herein from my friends of the Long-Robe; but truely, save that the learned and most civil Gentleman Sir <HI>Thomas Witherington,</HI> Serjeant at Law imparted a discourse w^c^h in the conclusion of this Chapter I mean to print <HI>verbatim,</HI> nothing has been communicated from any of them to me. It is probable at first men that studied the Common Laws dwelt &amp; lodged in diffusion, where being far from the Courts of <HI>Westminster,</HI> and uncertain to be found by those that desired their skill and advice,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>How proba|bly the Inns of Court first began.</HI></NOTE> they to avoid that trouble to themselves and their Clyents, did associate and joyn their studies and lodgings each to other, which in time came to be ac|counted <HI>Studium publicum</HI>; all of the Profession resorting to the common residence, and so making one publick presence of Law and Lawyers. After as they encreased, men of name withdrawing themselves for convenience of more room and better air, as their Clyents followed them, so also young Students, admirers of them, joyned themselves to them; till at last by time and agreement they grew into some propor|tion of a body, which had so much of Head and Members, Lawes and Servants, as are necessary to a subsistence of Honour, and a perpetuation of Being: Study being best carryed on in a place of repose, and by numbers that are ambitious to search that they may know, to know that they may professe, to professe that they may gain, to gain that they may enrich their Heirs and Families, and by these riches acquired by the Law, encourage a Continuation of Students in the Law.

<P>THIS Chapter is purposely designed to treat of the <HI>Inns of Court,</HI> and of all those circumstances in and about them; which the Chancellour, whose delight and stay was much in them, endeavours to impart to the honour and advantage of them. For since our Chancellour was no heady and desultory Writer, (who passes over the solid parts, and treats onely of the trifles of his undertaking) but a grave and learned Au|thour, which gives every limb and part its due <HI>Emphasis,</HI> proportion, and ingrediency, whereby he makes the whole symmetrious. As he had before in the eight Chapter
<PB N="526" REF="275">
discoursed of the <HI>Forma Iuris,</HI> which every good Student should embrace and prose|cute; so here he does discourse of the <HI>Forma &amp; Imago Studii,</HI> of the nature and or|der of the <HI>Inns of Court,</HI> wherein the Law, which is so useful to Order and Religion, is studyed. Concerning these I must profess my unhappiness not to be able to write as I would, and they deserve; (for that they being no Corporations, but Convents of men who have no sanction from the Prince to incorporate them, but are what they are by mutual Consent and an Order of common understanding, which passes between the gravity and youth of them, who are for the most part so considerate each of o|ther, that what the Bench and Parliaments in them conclude upon, the rest observe; or otherwise must expect not onely the scandal of being rebellious, but the disfavour of the Judges who will not hear any <HI>Korah's</HI> that are disorderly to the Ancients rules: which loss of their practice and reputation makes some as plyable to the Benchers or|ders, as the Benchers are obsequious to reason and justice in the dispensation of them to the Youngsters.) I say, concerning these I would more elaborately discourse, but that I yet neither finde, nor have communicated to me any thing but what is too nar|row to compleat such an undertaking. Wherein therefore I am defective herein (as I am in many other parts of this endeavour) as I humbly crave the Learneds pardon for it, so I promise an hereafter-supply if God shall bring this Commentary to a second E|dition, and betwixt this and then I shall endeavour such Collections as may most con|tribute thereto; in the mean time I am to consider these Houses or Lodges of Law as our Text calls them <HI>Hospitia.</HI> Concerning <HI>Hospitia</HI> I have written in the Notes on <HI>cap.</HI> 36. that which I shall add here, is, that the Lodges and places of receipt to Soul|diers in their advance to or retreat from the Warrs, were of old so called. For though the Souldiers had among the <HI>Romans</HI> their <HI>Hospitia Campestria,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hospitiorum no|mine Domini te|nentur praebere Hospitibus, qua habitationis causa tantum necessaria sunt.</HI> Tholossan. <HI>lib.</HI> 7. 8, 9.</NOTE> which were their Tents in the Field; yet their <HI>Hospitia Militaria</HI> were fixed to some settled place or other, from which they departed not, but to which resolutely adhered. These were called <HI>Inns</HI> for their receipt and charitable accommodation, because what receipt they gave was free and in an orderly and sutable manner to such expectations as strangers could hope to receive upon travel. Hence comes it to pass, that because <HI>Hospitia Militaria</HI> are properly intended to receive Military men; the <HI>Inns</HI> of these Military men termed <HI>Templars,</HI> residing in the <HI>Temple, London,</HI> gave name to the most anci|ent and eminent of the <HI>Inns of Court, The Temples,</HI> which became <HI>Inns of Law,</HI> as heretofore I have shewed.</P>
<P>These <HI>Hospitia</HI>] our Chancellour sayes, are either <HI>Minora,</HI> preparatory Lodges of Freshmen;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Order of <HI>Lincolns</HI> 4 <HI>&amp;</HI> 5 P &amp; M. <HI>An.</HI> 1557. <HI>lib.</HI> 4. p. 317.</NOTE> for none were to be admitted of an <HI>Inns of Court,</HI> but such as first have been in an <HI>Inns of Chancery</HI>; and such as probably were forced by exigency of for|tune to live near: or <HI>Majora,</HI> such as received not the Gudgeons and Smelts, but the Polypus's and Leviathans, the Behemoths and the Gyants of the Law.

<P>By this it appears the Honour of being an <HI>Inns of Court</HI> man was great in our Chancel|lour's time, because none were admitted of them but men as of bloud so of fortune; since to live and study there was so chargeable that a thrifty liver there could not come off for less then 80 <HI>Escues,</HI> w^c^h I take not to be as Mr. <HI>Mulcaster</HI> makes it to amount to twenty Marks, but casting the <HI>Escues</HI> into those that are <HI>Escue vicil,</HI> worth 7 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> Ster|ling a piece,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Si vis vacare ani|mo, aut pauper esse aportet, aut pauperi similis; non potest Studium esse salutare sine frugalitatis cura.

For although most men now repair thither for fashion, and to spend mo|ney; yet of old they thither went and there resided to acquire parts of virtue and action, and to compleat themselves as good Christians and stout Gentlemen; and this to doe, nothing contributes more, next God's blessing, then frugality of living and keeping close to study: for large fortunes and allowances make youth preys to vice and baits to seduction. For when in elder Ages there was more severity conveyed to youth by education and frugality of nurture, then were effeminacies anticipated, and luxury was wholly borne down by the prevalence of resolved virtue; the moderation

of which as it directed the affections and desires to God and goodness, so did it take a|way the necessity of a great fortune, which in this deviation from it, is indispensably to concur with the charge and state of immoderate and high living, which is the rea|son of the change of times in portions and expences; for whereas the portion of <HI>H. the third,</HI> Son to the Conquerour, when he was a younger brother, was but bare 5000 pounds, and that was then thought a good estate, now such a portion is thought but small for an <HI>Aldermans</HI> Son;<NOTE PLACE="marg">In his Character of some Kings of <HI>England. p.</HI> 150</NOTE> <HI>So much,</HI> saith Sir <HI>Henry Wotton, is either wealth increased, or moderation decreased.</HI></P>
<Q><P>Et si servientem sibi ipse ibidem habuerit, ut eorum habet pluralitas, tanto tuno ma|jores ipse sustinebit expensas.</P></Q>
<P>In our Chancellours time, men of honour and worship, sent no children to these <HI>Inns of Court,</HI> but such as they could honourably and plentifully treat there, which they not opinionating to be done, other then by adding to their convenient Chamber, de|cent furniture, rich apparel, different Masters for every science, and a full purse for every pastime, a well apparated servant to attend them, enhaunsed the expence of their stay there, which they very willingly allowed to train their Sons up to generous purposes of recreation and profession, since, as they were the best of the Nation that so placed them, so they having sufficient estates to defray the charge of their conspi|cuity, expended it on them in their persons and equipage. For as then none but men of estate entred themselves in the <HI>Inns of Court</HI>; so being there entred, none almost lived but with a servant to attend him when an under-bar student, which was very comely and useful, if the servant were well chosen, and proved well. For though a mean and trifling servant,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Servus, perpetuus mercenarius est. Lib.</HI> 3. Senec. <HI>De Benefic. p.</HI> 47.</NOTE> be but a harpy, and serves onely to promote a debauched Masters vanity, by the instrumentality to which he takes confidence to become a Quarter-Master with his Master, as knowing he must not displease him, least the se|crets intrusted with him take ayre by his discovery; the convenience of which servant to carry on his secret as it first assisted the Master in his clancular designs of vice, so the awe of his detection upon discontent, makes him so mean a vassal to his servant, as nothing meaner can be. For nothing is more insolent then a necessary servant, which the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> found true in Sir <HI>Anthony Bacon,</HI> whom he made use of in all his se|crecies in the difference he had with <HI>Cecil,</HI> and thereby did so inflame <HI>Bacons</HI> merce|nary soul, that he covetous to dreyn the Earl of some notable reward, gave out that he could mend his fortune under the <HI>Cecilians,</HI> which the Earl of <HI>Northampton</HI> hearing, friendlily discovered to the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> with this concurring advice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir. <HI>Henry Wot|ton. p.</HI> 14, 15.</NOTE> <HI>to keep</HI> Bacon <HI>his confident, whatever he gave him,</HI> least his discoveries should ruine the Earl in his fortune and honour. The Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> followed the counsel, and gave him <HI>Essex</HI> house, which he was fain after to redeem with 2500 pounds in money, and 1500 pounds he before had upon a like trick, which shews that servants if not well chosen, and warily trusted, are dangerous attendants. That then which the servant is an advan|tage in, is when he is sober and sincere, when he understands his duty, and makes con|science to perform it, and both will and can serve his Master to honest and worthy purposes, to excite him to worthy actions, to advise him humbly in doubts, this is a servant that deserves to have <HI>patrimonium libertini</HI> as well as he has <HI>ingenium libertini,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Senec. <HI>Ep.</HI> 27.</NOTE> as <HI>Seneca</HI> sayes, not as <HI>Lipsius</HI> interprets <HI>ingenium libertini, humile, terreum &amp; quod sa|peret stirpem,</HI> but in that he has a free and virtuous soul, deserves to be sutably rewar|ded for his service.

<P>This unavoidably follows upon the Premises truth: If none can be learned in the Lawes but those that study it, and none can to a latitude of learning study it but they that do it <HI>in proprio Studio,</HI> that is, <HI>take the water at the springs head,</HI> and attend the Courts in their debates and resolutions; and those that study it must be able and wil|ling to undergoe the charge, which few in <HI>Henry the Sixth</HI>'s time were but the <HI>No|biles,</HI> that is, the Gentry, who had fair Lands and Offices, by the income whereof they plentifully supported themselves, if by all these Gradations there is ascent to learning in the Law, then the learning that is attained to, must be by the Nobles, that is, the Gentry, who are so <HI>docti in Legibus,</HI>] that they are <HI>Sacrarum opinionum Condito|res,</HI> as after they have been double Readers or Serjeants they are accounted. I grant there might be some then, as now there are many more who are learned; yet not of the <HI>Nobilium genere,</HI> which is the reason of the <HI>vix</HI> to qualifie the peremptoriness of the position: but to one that was, twenty were not of any race below that of Gentry by the Father, which is the right line, and so are <HI>Nobiles</HI> within the Text; or by the Mother, who being <HI>de genere Nobilium,</HI> her son may by our Chancellour be said to be <HI>de Nobilium genere egressus.</HI></P>
<Q><P>Vnde magis aliis consimilis stat&ucirc;s hominibus, ipsi Nobilitatem curant &amp; conser|vationem honoris &amp; famae suae.</P></Q>
<P>This is added to shew the trust that the Nation puts in men of the Law, and the con|fidence they have in them from the consideration that they have honours and fortunes to aw them from all fordid and trucking practices. For though every man is, as an honest man, bound to keep himself just and upright, because of God his Judge, and Conscience his accuser or excuser; yet are some seemingly more obliged hereto then others, because they have superadded restraints and favours to those common ones, which the humane nature promiscuously hath, and by which it is circumscribed and confined: and this the Text makes to be <HI>Riches</HI> and <HI>Bloud,</HI> the two Darlings of all Po|lities, and those pair of Favourites that accommodate Peace and Warr. Now though no man can endow himself with either of these further then God gives him opportu|nity thereto, and gives him wisdom to discern and co-operate with his opportunities; yet every man that has the use of reason and the fervour of Justice in him, can chuse whether he will be fordid or not, and can (if he will) resolve to keep himself from a just arraignment of dishonesty and injustice. And therefore men, next to the fear of God, should propound to themselves great examples and great exceedings of any thing in their family before them, as that which might both keep them in aw of lessening their family by doing any thing minute, and put them forth to do somewhat beyond what is almost effectable: my reason is, because where there is not something of merit and un|vulgar floridness appearing in men, the disappointments of life will so lessen and abate them, that they shall have nothing able to cope with or prevail against them, but must take down their top-sayls and strike Mast, leaving all that is dear to them to the mercy of those cruel vicissitudes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sic <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nit mihi, quod plerisqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> non suo vitio ad inopi|am reda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tis; Om|nes agnoscunt, ne|mo succurrit.</HI> Sen. <HI>Ep.</HI> 1. <HI>Non suo vitio] sed temporum fortuna judicat callide in aula sibi tempus perire.</HI> Lipsius <HI>in Not. ad Ep.</HI> 1. p. 157.

A misery that facetious and generous spirits are so often flattered into and deluded by, that they bemoan themselves too late to be accounted either wise or recompensed.

<P>This the Chancellour writes to shew the generous accomplishment of a noble Stu|dent, whom, though he knows sent to the <HI>Inns of Court</HI> to be a professed Lawyer; yet he presents here as apt, by the quaintness of his general breeding to comply with all conditions of life, to which God, his genious and his opportunities shall most in|cline him to.

Of the first sort are singing and playing n instruments very great additions to a Gen|tleman; for though Musique seem to be but of an aiery and volatile nature, yet in the consequence of it it proves to be a very notable furtherer of the minds delight, order, and composure, which is the reason that the ancients prescri|bed Musique not onely in Civil, but sacred rites: and that not to make those myste|ries light and jovial, but to draw up the heart and soul by every occasion of joy, and expressive agility to actuate it self upon that divine Opificer, whence these powers and art to improve them come,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cantus est modulatio, se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fluxus &amp; trans|itus vocis a gravi in acutum, &amp; vice ver|sa, per intervalla concinna, qui aptus est ad animi latitiam, dolorem, aut alium effectu~ exprimendum vel commovendum.</HI> Merseni|us Harmonicorum <HI>lib,</HI> 7 <HI>p.</HI> 113. <HI>In Tabul, proposit.</HI></NOTE> and by whom they are ingenerated in us.

This <HI>dulcimer</HI> of the voice, whether it be sacred or civil, is very effectual to excite the minde to all facetious pleasure, and to recruite it of those spirits which are exhaust by intentness and labour; therefore the Holy Ghost by <HI>Moses</HI> excites the people to praise God by singing <HI>Exod.</HI> 15.21. And in all the book of God, nothing is set forth as a devouter part of worship then vocal Musique, <HI>Sing unto the Lord</HI> is the exhortation of every <HI>Psalm</HI>; yea in the primitive times singing of Holy Anthems and Psalmes, was the peculiar character of Christians, the Heathens from this practice of the <HI>Iewes</HI> uttered most of the praises of their Gods and their He|roe's by singing, which is so harmeless and tunable a token of foulary joy, that no|thing can better testifie internal contentation and rapture then singing.</P>
<P>Whereas then 'tis said, <HI>Cantare ipsi addiscunt</HI>] it means not rude and artless sing|ing, for that is natural, (being the expression of the air or breath from the lung, which invigorates and sonifies it) but that which they learn is artly, singing by book and rule according to the Gammuth, and the true position and order of sounds, to give every note its heigth and depth, and time its length and breadth:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Omnis Cantus certis pthongis, interval|lis &amp; temporibus constat.</HI> Mersenius <HI>lib,</HI> 8, Harmonicorum <HI>p.</HI> 161.</NOTE> thus to sing, is to divide time into proper portions, and to observe order in the transports of our joyes, and this <HI>Ma|phius Vegius</HI> thinks so necessary to good institution, that nothing can be more graceful,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Musica ad degendum recte in otio vi|tam, moderandosque animorum motus, le|niendasque perturbationes ediscitur, qualis est maxime qua fortium virorum gesta, di|vinaque landes decantantur; nihil certe co|gnitione ejus utilius, nihil homini libero con|venientius.

And there|fore artly singing, as it is a very wholesome thing to keep the breath sweet, and has a taking acceptation with the ear and heart of all auditours; so has it a very useful influence on the content of all actions. For as we are to eat, sleep, recreate, study in proporti|on; so we are to be merry in due and convenient manner. Nothing more rocks asleep and reposes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Forte inter epulas</HI> Aulicis <HI>(uti mos est) canentibus.</HI> Aurel, Victor <HI>c.</HI> 5. <HI>De</HI> Cae|saribus <HI>p.</HI> 512&punc;</NOTE> nothing more renders entertain|ments acceptable then singing, which is the reason that all treat|ments at meales, all festivals of joy are associated with singing, the pleasure of which does not onely in a sort disgest the meat, but affa|blize the nature of the communicants each to other, especially when hereto <HI>instrumen|tal Musique</HI> is added, which the Text calls <HI>genus harmoniae.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In omni genere harmoniae</HI>] This is not so much winde and pipe, as touch and string|musique; not the Musique that is loud, Stentorian, and clamarous, as that which is sweet, silent and undisturbing: Musique which goes so soft that it may sweetly note it <HI>in a Ladies Chamber,</HI> as the Proverb is. This musique of the Lute-Viol, and the like, is that which becomes an <HI>Inns of Court,</HI> and an <HI>Inns of Court-man</HI>; nor is there any thing in the World more disposes men to sweet and social temper;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>None hate Musique, but rude mindes.</HI></NOTE> then Musique and Voices, these by a pleasing and harmonious witchery, harmelesly sedate and surprise mindes to a delightful comportment with all humours, accidents, companies. Nor are any men more acceptable companions then men of Musical addiction; For if <HI>Orpheus</HI> as the Poets fein, surprised trees, &amp; <HI>Arion</HI> fishes by their Harpes; If instruments well tuned, lay evil spirits in <HI>Sauls</HI>; and pacifie the distempers of brainless furies; if this be the effect of Harmony, to incline the eye to kindness, the hand and foot to agility, the ear to attention, the whole man to grace of behaviour, Our <HI>Inns of Court</HI>-man is to be ac|complished therewith, and not to stay there, or come away thence without it.</P>

<P><HI>Ac Iocos singulos Nobilibus convenientes</HI>] <HI>Iocus</HI> is properly verbal mirth, telling of Romantique Stories, and proposing Riddles, exercising Questions and Commands, acting passions of love, which therefore is called Courtship.

the Student of the Law, though he may keep his Chamber <HI>post divina obsequia,</HI> yet after he has been at the publique prayers (wherein his devotion dictates the most hum|ble and un-pharisaical posture to him) yet even his retirement and holy-day recrea|tion must be reading of Scripture and of History, that thereby he may know how as a Christian and a good man, to demean himself. For the word of God being notified to man, as the declared will of his maker, and the Law of his eternal soul, as by reading, understanding, and practising of it, it is <HI>able to make him wise unto Salvation</HI>; so by reading the Records of past ages, he satisfies himself in the virtues, vices, humours, lawes and reasons of the transactions of them, and is thereby enabled to discourse of, and judge concerning the nature and impulses of the same. For as in order to the grace that leads to, and the glory that is in the triumphant world, the Sacred Scriptures are the surest Oracle, <HI>and he that trusts to them shall never be ashamed or deceived, be|cause they are not onely the power of God to salvation, but the light that shines in the dark|ness of errour and infidelity; and discovers those things, that eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor hat entred into the heart of man to conceive or think of,</HI> which is the reason <HI>Our Lord charges his Disciples to search the Scripture, assuring them that therein they have eternal life, and they are they that testifie of him</HI>; So in relation to this world so full of sin sorrow and dissatisfaction,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nihil earum re|rum scire, quae an|tequam nasceris factae sunt. hoc est, semper esse pueru~, cognoscere vero res gestas antiquitali, exemplorumque memorabilium ha|bere notitiam uti|le decorum. lauda|bileque ac prope divinum est.</HI> Cic.</NOTE> the study of Chronicles, in which ages long since past, are presented men as in then being, is the second best expence of time wisdom can possibly prescribe, since conversation with wise mens books and actions are no less instructive in wisdome then personal converse with them: which because men who are not contem|porary with, or near livers to, or timelily acquainted with them, cannot have, History and Record of them is onely able to become supplement to those great defeats, which sin on mans, and judgement on Gods part, has incommodated mortality with, and a|gainst which there is no compensation but that of continuation, by which the excellent and immortal penns of heroique men, doe by Histories in a sort eternize men and a|ges. Which is the reason our Text makes holy dayes spent in reading Scripture before prayers in the morning, and History after prayers in the after-noon (for so I under|stand <HI>divina obsequia</HI> as referring to the <HI>Inns of Court</HI> devotion-orders) to be a most notable account of time, and the probablest engine to adorn a Students life with piety and knowledge.</P>

Indeed travel when men are of yeares, have conduct, and design it an accomplishment to their understanding, and accordingly employ it, is very soveraign to excellent ends; but as it is afforded youth, and they by it are seduced from that gravity and sobriety, that more restrained breeding would ac|quaint them with, so 'tis dangerously enervative of all future stayedness, which our Ancestors well understanding, chose rather to put their Sons, how well born, honoured and fortun'd soever, to these <HI>Inns of Court</HI> there to learn the mode of living, sutably to their quality, rather then to send them abroad, fearing nothing more, then the infection of forein toies and the tinctures of forein vices.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nihil enim mori|bus hujus atatis publicum, praeter aerem &amp; pluviam censetur.</HI> Budaeus <HI>lib.</HI> 4. <HI>De Asse, p.</HI> 171. <HI>edit.</HI> Vas|cos.</NOTE> But now the times are such, that the <HI>Inns of Courts</HI> are thought mean lodges for Nobility and the eldest Sons of Gentry, who all goe abroad to travel, leaving the younger brothers or Gentlemens sons of smal|ler fortune to inhabite them: so that the young <HI>Inns of Court-men</HI> of our age, are such as mostly study to profess the Law, and by it become great and rich, which they well deserve to be who preferr a learned diligence and industry in a profession, before a vain sinful and needy idleness and latitude of life, which is so great a burthen to a noble and actively virtuous humour, as nothing can be more, since that onely answers the end of Gods mercy to our beings, births, and lives, which enables us to glorifie him, benefit men, and serve our own fames, in the opinion of those that either knew us alive, or read us dead, which they will hardly] with pleasure delight to do those who studied themselves onely as all persons of vice and vanity doe.</P>

<P>All the residue of learners are called Inner-Barresters, which are the youngest men, that for lack of learning,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Inner-Barresters.</HI></NOTE> and continuance, are not able to argue and reason in these Motes, nevertheless whensoever any of the said Motes be brought in before any of the said Benchers, then two of the said Inner-Barresters sitting on the said forme with the Utter-Barresters, doe for their exercises recite by heart the pleading of the same Mote-Case, in Law-<HI>French,</HI> which pleading is the declaration at large of the said Mote-Case, the one of them taking the part of the Plaintiff, and the other the part of the Defendant.</P>

<P>And besides this, daily in some houses after dinner, one at the Readers board, be|fore they rise, propoundeth another of his Cases to him, put the same day at his read|ing, which Case, is debated by them all in like forme, as the Cases are used to be argued at his reading, and like order is observed at every messe, at the other Tables, and the same manner alwayes observed at supper, when they have no Motes.</P>

In this <HI>Christmas</HI> time, they have all manner of pastimes, as singing and dancing; and in some of the houses ordinarily they have some interlude or Tragedy played by the Gentlemen of the same house, the ground, and matter whereof, is devised by some of the Gentlemen of the house.</P>

<P>The Clerks Commons amounteth by the year to five pounds six shillings eight pence, which is after the rate of 2 shillings 2 pence a week.</P>
<P>These, most redoubted Sovereign Lord, are the most universal and general things con|cerning the Orders and Exercises of learning in the houses of Court, which we thought meet to describe, and to present into your Grace's hands; and having regard to o|ther particular or private things, we thought it not convenient to trouble Your Highness with them, partly, because of the multitude of them, and partly, because they are things of no great importance, or weight.</P>

<P>THIS Chapter begins with a reference to the conclusion of the 47. Chapter, where according to the order of the Dialogue, the Prince is introduced query|ing, <HI>Why the Lawes of</HI> England <HI>are not taught in Vniversities, and why Degrees inchoate and consummate are not conferred in them.</HI> Now the Chancellour being willing to let no Query of the Prince pass unresolved, after he has written of the Academies of the Law, (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">Inns of Court and Chancery) which are the subjects of the 49. Chapter, proceeds in this, to a replication in satisfaction to him; that though the Lawes of <HI>England</HI> do differ from the Civil Lawes in the names and kindes of their Degrees: yet in the import and signification of them, they are sutable in every notation of desert and dignity, <HI>Licet gradus hujusmodi,</HI> &amp;c. saith our Chancellour.</P>

For besides that it is coupled in the Stat. 1 <HI>Mar. Sess.</HI> 2. <HI>c.</HI> 8. with the great men of <HI>England,</HI> and has place next to Knights;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sir Edw.

For though it has not been said that this Degree has 130 grand priviledges attending it as <HI>Ludovicus Bologninus</HI> has computed those of a Doctor of the Law, (thanks be to him, who being himself a Doctor has generously amassed and propalated the dignity of his degree.) Which none of the learned Serjeants has ever, that I know, done to the lustre of their Dignity (being more intent on gain by it, then glory from it, which truely I beg their favour to say, is none of their greatest praise and emeritingest commendation,) yet is there much undoubtedly to be said and written in exemplification of the renown and worship that is due to this state and dignity of the learned Long-Robe. Now though I cannot serve them here in to the proportion I would, because to write of it strenuously and to the <HI>non ultra</HI> of the nature of it, would become a distinct work of some largeness, and a noble Compiler of some more then ordinary industry and exactness, learnedly and with judgement to do it; though I say I cannot undertake to write to the ampli|tude it calls for, yet so far as my tenuity can contribute thereto I readily shall, being a servant to all and a particular friend to some of them that are dignified with this state and degree: in testimony whereof, I shall crave leave according to the method of my Comment, to write what I finde sutable to the matter of our Chancellour's Text, and apposite to be insisted on in the illustration of his language and meaning. The form of which solemnity of Creation he thus describes.</P>

<P><HI>Quoties sibi videtur opportunum</HI>] This is to be understood when the degree of Serjeants growes thinn by death, or other disablement, when there are not enough to serve the King and his people in the great affaires of Law; <HI>For Serjeants of old</HI> (saith the Lord Chancellour <HI>Coventry) were men of Learning and great cunning, who did love the Law for the Law's sake, and intended their Clyents Cases for God, and a good Conscience sake, in order to which heretofore Counts and Pleadings were received at the Barr, and every little doubt was prepared and cleared by a debate there openly before either Demurrer or Issue were joyned, such was the care of the Serjeants not to disad|vantage their clyents cause,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord <HI>Coventry</HI>'s Speech in Chan|cery. 12. <HI>Car.</HI> 1. <HI>Anno</HI> 1636. at the creation of Serjeants.</NOTE> <HI>by any suddain or indigested conceptions, or by omissions or neglect, and then the Prothonotary entre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">it on record,</HI> thus that Sage.

<P>As Kings at their Coronations give Medals in token of their Entrance on their Government, and in memory of the lustre of their triumphs; so have they indulged men of worth in favour with them to symbolize with them in such partial imitations of greatnnss, as are competible with their being Subjects.

From this use of good Kings and Cheifs so to do, probably grew the example of our Ancestours, and the use to our Chancellour's time (as I think) for Serjeants upon Creation-dayes, to bestow peices of gold, artlyly form'd and inscrib'd, in token of their admission to honour by the King s favour, which I ground upon the former insi|nuations, and that which is additional to it in the Text; for notwithstanding there is mention of Rings after in this Chapter, yet here 'tis said, <HI>Dabit aurum secundum con|suetudinem.</HI> But of this, as of all other the Solemnities of Serjeants, because our Chan|cellour who was long an Ancient of <HI>Lincolns Inn,</HI> under the name of <HI>Fortescue senior,</HI> and I take to be serjeanted about the 12. of <HI>H.</HI> 6. thinks it too tedious to discourse, <HI>Cum Scripturam majorem illa exigant,</HI> as his words are; I thereupon restrain my pen the la|bour to enlarge, referring the plenary satisfaction in it to such discourses as are purposely intended for illustration of it.

So it followeth.</P>

<P>Herein the account of the whole, and every particular's expence at his call to be Ser|jeant, is set down, 1600 <HI>Scuta,</HI> which here if he means half-rose Nobles at 3. <HI>s.</HI> 4. <HI>d.</HI> a piece, comes to 266. <HI>l.</HI> 13. <HI>s.</HI> 4. <HI>d.</HI> to each of them, which being multiplyed by 8. the number in the Text mentioned to be called, it makes up the 3200.

<P>Expence then they must be at, and a great one too, rather more then now-a-dayes; for then Serjeants (as all other Honours) were fewer then now, and those onely had calls to them who were men of great estates, able to live like themselves in all points of greatness sutable to their Degree, which was expensive not onely as to the quantity predescribed, (which I take to be the charge of their Robes, Attendants, Dyet, and Equipage:) but also further in Donaries of Rings which they are to give: so the Text proceeds.</P>

For as women are wedded to their Husbands by Rings, and Doctors to their Profession by Rings; so is the Serjeant evidenced to be wedded to the Law by his donation of Rings, as the Ensign of his Creation in the state and dignity of a Serjeant. And these our Text sayes cost the

Therefore it has been known that Liveryes given upon this occasion have stayed by the meaner sort of men many years, though the better, after the Solemnity, give them a|way; for when their service (by the expiration of the Solemnity) determines, then also their Liveryes grow with them out of season.</P>

<P>Herein the Serjeants degree is to the office of a Justice necessarily precursive above that of a Doctor to a Bishop; for he that is a Graduate in the Universities may be a Bishop, though a Doctor he be not: but no man how learned soever he be can be a Justice, but he that is already a Serjeant; nor can he sit in the King's Courts but with that particular habiliment of a Serjeant, which (with reverence to that noble Dignity) is in a kinde <HI>nayled to his head,</HI> I mean so fixed that thence it is not to be removed, no not (I beg the boldness to say) in the King's presence, this is the Caul on his head called the <HI>Coyff.</HI> The Chancellour words it by <HI>Birretum,</HI> others by <HI>Birrus</HI> or <HI>Bir|reta, tegmen capitis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>De liabitu quo <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> oportet extra <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">om.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Pileus</HI> saith the <HI>Codex Theodos.</HI> It was permitted servants of old as a token their servility was <HI>On its last leggs,</HI> as we proverbially call service that is de|termining, after-times adopting the use of these Night-caps or <HI>womens gear,</HI> as we

<P>This is subjoined as a notable instance of this Serjeants dignity, to wit, that whereas of old no man might come capp'd into Princes or Great mens presences, without a par|ticular grant so to doe, which I collect from the use till <HI>Henry the Eighth</HI>'s time, when I read one Mr. <HI>Brown</HI> had Letters Patents,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fuller</HI> Church History. <HI>part.</HI> 2. <HI>p.</HI> 167.</NOTE> confirmed by Act of Parliament, to enable him to put on his Cap in the presence of the King or his Heirs, or any Lord Spiritual or Temporal in the Land, Whereas I say no man might come capp'd into the King's presence without special leave, the Serjeant <HI>Privilegio stat&ucirc;s &amp; grad&ucirc;s</HI> might; and the reason perhaps might be, for that the head of a Serjeant, so full of law and learn|ing useful to the King and his people, should suffer no injury by cold, nor appear no not with the defects of old age, or other accident, which might injure or diminish his reputation: but that he may retain that reverence that becomes so venerable a Pro|fession as the Law is, and so grave a Sage as He the Serjeant is presumed to be. This may be one reason why Princes permits these <HI>worthy Persons</HI> to wear that in their pre|sence to which they thereby command reverence from others, who are much ruled by the practice of their betters, especially of their Prince, who not onely suffers these to appear before him Coyff'd, but often speaks with them and is counselled by them in matters that concern his Crown and Dignity; and even then when they are nearest him, <HI>Licet cum Celfitudi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e sua ipse loquatur</HI>] they do stand capp'd and coyff'd</P>

<P>Till the Chancellour be sat in the Court, the Serjeant appears not; for the intent of the Solemnity being to magnifie the grace of the King and the office of the Judge, the best means thereto is to do it <HI>plena Curia,</HI> when there is the greatest appearance both of Judges, Officers, and Auditors, which then being, when the Chancellour is fat, the to be promoted Serjeant appears, and then the Chancellour, who is alwayes a man of learning and oratory, declares the King's favour to his people in supplying them with Seats of Judgement, and with judicious and just Sitters on them: and that in such a number as sutes best with the expedition of justice, and the prevention of delay, er|rour, or iniquity; yea, who continually provides against the supersedals of death, impotency or demerit, by additional Justices to compleat the necessary and usual number.

For as the Patent read declares what the King's will is; so the Oath read and administred which is that of 18 <HI>E.</HI> 3. shews him what he is to perform in duty to the King and his people, To the King he takes the Oath of Allegiance kneeling,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crook 3 <HI>Rep.

<P>This is a summary of the <HI>juramentum Iustitiariorum</HI> 18 <HI>E.</HI> 3. and it consists of those heads, which comprehend the pious and plenary dispatch of Justice, <HI>freely with|out sale, fully without denyal, speedily without delay,</HI> which though it were declared in those words, <HI>Nulli vendemus, nulli negabimus aut differemus Iustitiam vel rectum</HI>; yet is more fully here charged on the Judges, who as the King's distributers of it to the people,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vet.

For therefore is the subject of <HI>England</HI> rich, free, secure, and what not that is emulable; because his Prince pleases to rule by the Lawes, which Lawes are distributed by such Justices as fear God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 Instit. <HI>c.</HI> 6<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>p.</HI> 146, 147.</NOTE> and reverence man no further then they reverence God in Heaven, and the Law on Earth, which is the true and during support of Sovereignty and subjection.</P>

<P>Here the Text tells us, that there is no cost of Presents, entertainment or equipage at this advancement of a Serjeant to a Justiceship; and the reason why none there is, to wit, that the cost of solemnities attends Degrees, Dignity and State of Honour con|ferred on a person,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hac est voluntas Regis per Iustitia|rios suos, &amp; per legem suam, &amp; non per Dominum Regem in Camera sua vel aliter.</HI> 2 <HI>R.</HI> 3. <HI>fol.</HI> 12. 3 Instit. <HI>p.</HI> 146.</NOTE> from the result whereof others, attendants, relations and friends are seen in service and gratified for it: but Justiceship being onely delegation to an of|fice executable by and determinable at the pleasure of the King, there is no Degree proceeded in beyond that of Serjeant, but an additional faculty to express Magistratique|ly and with judicial authority, the learning of Law, that in the Serjeant was seen in pleading, and now may further appear in judging. It is true, in the Case of Bishops it is otherwise, for though when they were Doctorated they kept Feast; yet shall that not excuse them, but at their Consecration, they so shall doe also, because they are ad|mitted into a superiority of order,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Episcopatus est Sacerdotium com|pletum &amp; perfe|ctum, inferiores or|dines sunt antece|cedentia ad Sa|cerdotium ex con|gruitate, sed non ex necessitate.</HI> Du|randus <HI>lib.</HI> 4. <HI>dist.</HI> 24. <HI>Q.</HI> 1. <HI>art.</HI> 8. <HI>p.</HI> 809.</NOTE> and have a dignity of temporary Baronage, though not personal, yet in the rights of their Sees, and are therefore to gratulate the King's fa|vour and their friends kindness in attending the Ceremonies of their Consecration with preparation for, &amp; entertainment of them with gloves, and good cheer, and with sober, hearty and generous welcome, the cream, marrow and Musique of all entertainments: but in this of a Justice, the official Improvement of a Serjeant, there is no cause of further joy and triumph, then as it is an opportunity to glorifie God, serve the King, and his people, honour the Law, his study and profession, nor is the reward of it more, if so much, as by a good round practice is gained; And therefore when it comes to a Serjeant of yeares that has plyed hard at the oare when young, and has feathered his nest well, it comes very seasonable to alleviate his toyl and to be a port to his old

Thus the learned Knight understands these very words of our Chancellour;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spelm.

<P>This clause is insinuative to the Prince why, and upon what reason Formalities were established, and civil Ceremonies first nourished, to wit, in order to the great and more consequent ends of stability and government. For as hedges of thorn and bry|ars preserve fields of Corn and Grain, and locks of Iron on doore of wood defend Carkanets of jewels, and Treasuries of gold, as Souldiers that have hardly a tatter (as we say) at their breeches, protect rights that have Kingdomes depending on them, and farthing Candles help men to finde a gemm that is invaluable, and without them would be lost; so the little things (as they are thought) of forms and methods, habits and proceedings, doe so conduce to the greater and nobler parts and portions of ad|ministrative prudence and virtue, that without them and their punctilio's in every thing duly observed, Errors and Inconveniencies will ensue. This is the reason our Chancellour mindes the Prince, when God shall doe well with him, to doe well by the Law, not onely in the greater and more considerable matters of securing it from all

encroachment upon it, but also in the very circumstantial and ritual appendances to it, <HI>qualem habitum te plus ornare optarem</HI>] and that not so much for love to mee, your Chancellour who have followed your misfortunes and disasters, and resolve to live and die your Votary, who though now a Banished Person from the Bench, and from the Countrey I love because I was born in it; yet cannot but wish well to the Law my study,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>Cic. <HI>pro lege</HI> Ma|nilia.</P>

I say Our Chancellour does not here barely desire their esteem, but somewhat more <HI>decretis ornare,</HI> to declare favours to them by Law, <HI>Aedificare &amp; ornare classes,</HI> to enlarge the borders and boun|daries of houses of Law, and to make the habits of Lawyers, <HI>vestitum pulcherrimum, &amp; ornatum Regalem,</HI> to account the professors of the Law as the Orator did Eloquent men of his time, <HI>The Flower of the Nation, the Firmament of the</HI> Roman <HI>splendor, the Ornament of the Cities Dignity</HI>; This is the generous temper, and supereffluent ca|taract of his love to his profession and study beyond any private and narrow emolu|ment of his own. For He presents not to the Prince his Fidelities and Sufferings, his Eclipses and hazzards, his Relations and Countrey, whom for his Sovereigns sake, he has quitted and is dubious ever to see, He beseeches him not to remember his Family <HI>when He comes into his Kingdom, and to set one Son of his at his right hand, and ano|ther at his left in the glory of his restitution,</HI> no such mercenary sallies of a mean soul does he in these words discover; but all that He remembers him of as a grave Counsellour and Father to his youth, so winnowed and chaffed to and fro by the <HI>Euro|clydon</HI> of a distracted Nation,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Orat. pro</HI> Milone</NOTE> a potent Antagonist in a possessed Throne, and his doubt|ful victory over his present dislustre,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Orat.</HI> 3. <HI>in</HI> Cati|lin.</NOTE> All that I say he craves of Him, is that he would make the Law which he counted <HI>lumen &amp; ornamentum Reipublicae,</HI> as <HI>Tully</HI> stiled <HI>Hor|tensius,</HI> in all the Ceremonies of it honourable, and the habit of it <HI>Honoris ornamenta, monumenta gloriae &amp; landis insignia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Orat. pro Domo sua.</HI></NOTE> as the Orator said against <HI>Catilin.</HI> And this he does, not from a spirit of opposition or in <HI>remora</HI> to the conspicuities of other artists; but as a brave and true spirited <HI>Englishman pro bono publico,</HI> this (saies he) will make men esteem well of the Law, and the professors of it, <HI>&amp; ornatissimam de illis sententiam dicere,</HI> as the Orator's words are, and this comes to our Texts <HI>ad decorem status Legis,</HI> that men by the honours and riches they attain to by study of the Law, may be invited to apply themselves to it, and acquire excellent knowledge in it, and in the Conclusion fill the Nation with learning and skill, which accomplishes that which the Chancellour here presses, <HI>honorem regni.</HI> Thus the Chancellour evidences in his advice to the Prince, his love to the Law, which yet as a wise man he desires not exhibition of, till a fit sea|son to shew it self in, is effectually administered. He, Good man, is <HI>not all agog,</HI> for he has learned <HI>patience and submission by the things he has suffered</HI>; but resolves by a holy and humble obsequiousness to serve Providence, and submit to the Regency of it. Therefore while he shewes his Love in this Advocation for the Law, he also ma|nifests his submission to God for the time when his pleasure shall most advantage it self in the discovery of it, so it follows.</P>
<P><HI>Cum potestas tibi fuerit</HI>] Those are his modest limits. Princes as well as Subjects are in and under the power of God, and he will have his will on them as well as on meaner men; for they are all but <HI>clay in the hand of the Potter,</HI> and the vessel he makes to honour is but still a vessel, the work of his hand. 'Tis not for us wormes, who crawl on a soyl of dust, and are busied in a World full of shaddowes and snares, to stand upon termes, and be dictatorianly haughty.

<P><HI>Non sedent in Curiis.</HI>] That the Justices <HI>sit</HI> argues their authority, that they <HI>sit in the King's Courts</HI> displayes and declares the publickness of it; but that <HI>they sit not above three hours,</HI> and that in the first and clear part of the day, when there is time to pre|pare for the Court before it sets, and to dispatch the subsequent business in the After|noon when the Court sits not, is contrived with great prudence. For Lawing is not the <HI>Totum Regni,</HI> but the Plough and the Ax, the Shop and the Barn, the Field and the Market is to be tended as well as the Study and the Barr. Therefore as there are but certain times which are called Terms, wherein the Courts of the King sit, and by them causes in dispute can be determined: so are there in those Terms certain hours in the day, in which onely those Courts sit to hear causes, which hours are the hours that are neither so early that weak and sickly persons cannot rise at them, nor men, when they rise be without sleep, and drowsiness not shaken off them, fit presently to come to the Court: but they are the three middle hours in the fore-noon, which in the time precurring them, gave way to devotion, and preparation for the Court by consulta|tion with Counsel before the Court sits, and takes the wits of both Clyents and wit|nesses in their coolness and keenness before they be loaden and surcharged with visce|ration, which the antecession of meat burthens the After-noons hours with. I say, the order of the King's Justices sitting those hours, from eight to eleven, that is, from that time more or less as emergencies require, (for strict minutes, no nor hours in this case are precisely stood upon, that Maxim of the Law being true here, <HI>Apices Iuris non sunt Iura,</HI>) argues a prudent appointment of experience to avoid the temerity and drowsiness, the indisposition and unfitness, that After-noons clogg dispatches with. For though as to Formalities and Entryes, as to matter preparatory to Tryals and Courts of Law, the fallows of Afternoons do well; yet as to the judicial and wise determination of affairs of life, reputation, and estate, the Morning judgement is most

subtile, sincere, and undisturbed: which is I believe the reason that the chief service and devotion of the Church was ever accounted her Morning Exercise.

<P>This inference is to have a modification to reduce it to rectitude in the Court of ex|perience and truth.

For though true it is, that Children are the gift of God, and that posterity to preserve a name, is much the delight of men and the mercy of God to many, that are in their families eternized by it, as has been our Royal-Family, in which,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Speech</HI> White-Hall. 1607. <HI>p.</HI> 520 of his works.</NOTE> in which, King <HI>Iames</HI> said he was in descent to the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> 300 yeares before Christ, and may it so continue in them I beseech God, and so is the suf|frage of all true <HI>Englishmen,</HI> till <HI>Shiloh</HI> come, that is, for this Worlds ever.

For though I know all the vigour and kindness nature has in her Repertory, and the most endeared expression of it parties can testifie each to other, availes nothing to encrease without Gods <HI>fiat,</HI> and his benedictive <HI>Amen</HI>; yet where those are, and are properly expressed, issue may come as the work of nature, as well as from a more hallowed cause, which our Chan|cellour calls here Gods grace, <HI>magna &amp; appropriata benedictio Dei.</HI> And therefore, though I concurr with Sir <HI>Edward Cook,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Preface to</HI> Lit|tleton.</NOTE> who to this of our Chancellour adds ano|ther Crown to Judges, That they die not will-less; yet doe I think both these if they be peculiar blessings, yet are onely so to Judges as to other wisemen, who walk hum|bly before God, are diligent in their callings and advice, and act for the peace and plenty of their families living and dying. For though I know to be Childless is a curse as in the case of <HI>Coniah,</HI> and to have no Male Children is a death to a family, daughters with their persons carrying all they are and have into their Husband families; yet is it better to have no Sons then lewd and for did ones.

And if wise Sons the Justices of <HI>England</HI> have eminently had, as truely I think, they more conspicuously then any profession of men have had, because they have given them better breedings then o|thers have done, 'tis much towards that our Chancellour intends in that clause, <HI>quasi appropriate benedictions Dei est.</HI></P>

<P>This our Chancellour grants, that by how much the greater improbability of it is, the greater may appear the blessing of it, to improve it to so unlikely an end. For though I think it well-becomes the Chancellour to advance his purpose by all the plausible arguments, that art with truth can forme to so noble a tendency; yet that thus he magnifies the estate of Merchants beyond that of Judges, and yet concludes the Judges children to be more durably fortunate &amp; worthily honoured then the sons of Merchants are, seems to me high-wracked, perhaps beyond the proportion that can be made out in confirmation of it. For though I believe in <HI>H</HI> 6. time the Justices were not so great gain|ers as since they have been, by reason whereof they might be so much excelled by Mer|chants as now they are not; yet, that either they then should be so mean in estate, that one Merchant should in wealth exceed them all, or that any Merchant should be so great, as that he should so vastly exceed ordinary calculates, seems to me strange I confess Trade is a thing of gain if well followed, and timelyly left; (for there are <HI>Apoplexies</HI> in Trade, and men sometimes had they known well when to have given over, had dyed great in estate, who persisting in it have dyed beggars:) but that it operates such Mountains and Mines of wealth, as one man of the number may thereby get twelve mens estates, and those Justices, who are for the most part men of great years and great fortunes, is to me strange, and as in the Text, <HI>Hyperbolique.</HI> Yet in that our Chancellour sayes what historially I will believe rather then dispute, unless I could think his age produ|ced what Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> Reign, the rise of riches and trade, did, a race of Sir <HI>Iohn Spencers,</HI> Sir <HI>William Cravens,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Greshams,</HI> to which may be added Sir <HI>Baptist Hicks,</HI> Sir <HI>William Cockain,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Middleton,</HI> and Sir <HI>Stephen Soams,</HI> un|less I say these were matched by men in our Chancellour's time, I see no reason he should so advance the gains of trade above that of the Law, when as there are instances of late as well as former Judges, Judge <HI>Gawdy, Mounson, Cook, Popham,</HI> and the Chan|cellour <HI>Coventry</HI> &amp; others equal to them. So that in what Profession soever, if God move the heart to ingenuity and diligence, and fortunate them to a prosperous event, there may be great encrease as well as in the Profession of the Law; for it is God alone that <HI>maketh men by his blessing rich,</HI> and addeth no sorrow to the riches he blesses men to get,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prov.</HI> 10.22. <HI>Prov.</HI> 11.25.</NOTE> <HI>For the liberal soul shall be made rich, and he that watereth shall be watered also himself.</HI></P>

<P>Because men of trade as well Strangers as others, are the inhabiters of Towns and Cities of trade, and their affaires will not permit them long stay; therefore the Law of <HI>England</HI> has allowed them a speedy course for the obtainment of right against de|tainers of it from them, so Stat. <HI>Acton Burnel</HI> 13 E. 1. 9 E. 3. <HI>c.</HI> 1, and other Sta|tutes, the execution of which being in Corporations (where of course by the local custome and Law there are weekly Courts, in three or less of which judgement may be obtained) Delayes are in a great measure out of doores.<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 <HI>H.</HI> 6. <HI>cap.</HI> 1.</NOTE> For those <HI>Chapiters</HI> and <HI>Assemblies</HI> of men having much of contract and contest, and of Buying and Selling for great summs upon barely the Royalty of the faith of traders, without Bond, Bill, or Witness, if it should not be speedily and without delay be made good by the Law of the place, so great inconveniences would follow, as the Law thinks not fit to permit, but to prevent the fatality of them, has by act of Parliament ever saved the rights of them, and that for the better carrying on of Justice, Honesty and Civil living with|in them; yet is not <HI>the haeste</HI> (as we say) <HI>a cause of waste,</HI> for though the tryals are speedy, yet not quicker then is convenient, both for the Plaintiff to prove his charge, and the Defendant to provide himself of defence; for if there were <HI>nimia praecipitatio</HI> it might cause <HI>Quaerentis partis laesionem,</HI> as well as in the <HI>nimia cunctatio</HI> there would be. That then which is by our Text aimed at is to present the Justice of <HI>England,</HI> in the legal Administration of it, admirable both as to the allowance of delay as a mode|rate and proper assistant to ripeness, and the disallowance of it as a dissipation of those ill humours speedy trial would draw to an head and expell.</P>

<P>This is added to shew that the greater and more valuable the nature of the thing is that the Law is to determine, the more time does the Law allow to the tryal and deci|sion of it. Real Actions what they are I have touched in the Notes on the 25 and 26. Chapters, yet as to the mention of them here, this is to be added, that the Lawes of all Nations esteem them the greatest and most valuable of things Civil, not in the sense that the <HI>actiones extraordinariae</HI> in the Civil Law are, which doe wholly depend on the Judges pleasure,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Et hae extraordinaria actione implora|tar officium judicis nobile, quia in ejus arbi|trio situm est ad agendum admittere vel non, cum Magistratus sit custos bons &amp; aqui.</HI> Tholoss. <HI>Syntag.

No such notion of real actions are we to have; for in that they are extraordinary actions, and cause more delay then other less consequent ones doe, arises from the value,
<PB N="582" REF="303">
intricacy, and difficulty of them, since title of Land and the fee's of Estate are much more weighty in their nature and value <HI>qua</HI> such, then Debts, Damages, and the like. This is the reason why in all Actions that are to try and determine solid parts of E|states, Lands,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vsque eo difficiles ac morosi sumus ut nobis non satis|faciat ipse</HI> Demo|sthenes. Cic. <HI>in in Oratore</HI> 56.</NOTE> Offices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> every where in the World, <HI>Morosi sunt processus,</HI> sayes our Text, that is, not onely tedious and crabbed, but difficult and hard to bring a|bout; <HI>Difficiles ac morosi Tully</HI> couples, to shew, that all things that are of Concern are leisurably to be transacted, and capable by many pauses and sluggs on them to be retarded: <HI>Sed in Anglia sunt celeriores,</HI>] For that the Law, as has been heretofore made good, hates delay as it is opposite to justice, which ought to be free, full, and speedy as farr as may stand with reason and convenience. For though Essoines upon solid reasons are allowed, and Protections in case of service to the King and Kingdom against the enemies of it been given some time, but ever by allowance of Law: yet did Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who maintained many Warrs, grant few or no Protections, and her reason was,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note this well.</HI></NOTE> <HI>That he was no fit Subject to be employed in her Service that was subject to other mens actions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cook <HI>on</HI> Little|ton. <HI>p.</HI> 131.

For though no Law can well hinder turbu|lentness, which is a sufficient vexation to its self; yet the Lawes of <HI>England</HI> do as much to discourage and punish it as may be,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3.

Which the Law doing to out-law those <HI>lyers in wait,</HI> whose onely work and wages it is to do mischief, does con|tribute much to the expedition of justice and to the absorption of unnecessary delayes, which are faults and errours of men, not of the Law, for that decrees righteous things, and proceeds according to evidence, allowing no delay but what is contributive to dis|covery and determination of right; if the indulgence of the Law to these purposes be abused by one parties industry, and not opposed by sutable vigilance in the other par|ty, the Law is not to be blamed, but the party whose the remissness is: for the Law gratifies alwayes the diligent Prosecuters, presuming those have ever good desires to come to issue, who prosecute the means thereunto most vigorously. Now that it may appear that the Chancellour's averrment, that proceedings legal in <HI>England</HI> are more speedy then in other parts they are, he quotes his own experience while he lived in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<Q><P>Sunt in Regno Franciae, in Curia ibidem suprema, quae Curia Parliamenti vecitatur, processus quidam, qui in eis plusquam triginta annis pependerunt. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P></Q>
<P>This instance acquaints us with the misery of seeking justice where justice is hard to be found;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cum</HI> Parisiam <HI>ve|nisset</HI> Ludovicus <HI>conventu generali habito, Rempubl. reformavit, statutis optimis Legibus de jure &agrave; judicibus dicendo, &amp; de offi|ciis non emendis.</HI> Gaguini <HI>Hist. in</HI> Ludovico Divo. <HI>lib.</HI> 7.</NOTE> for though true it be, there were of old good Laws and brave Parliaments in the constitution of <HI>France</HI>: yet, since Absoluteness has been affected, and Armies necessary to support it, since these must live upon the spoils and sharks from the poor Peasant, and all Offices must to sale to raise Revenues and to maintain the equipage of Fa|vourites, Causes that come into Advocates hands must be so lengthened out, that not years of Apprenticeship but even of life must be the measure of them. This the Chan|cellour makes out in instances of great oppression and excessive delay; which though it may perhaps in some few cases be parallel'd, some Law-suits being hereditary and con|tinuous: yet is that not because judgement of Law has not been effectually given in them, but for that the parties have resolved an incessancy of suit, and bequeathed the Christianless legacy of persistance to their Children and Successours, whereby they have immortaliz'd the suits and differences in their families, to the ruine and disquiet of one or both parties of them. This indeed has sometimes fallen out in <HI>England,</HI> but that has been in case of Honour and Arms bearing; as in that matchless memorable Contest between <HI>Reginald</HI> Lord <HI>Gray</HI> of <HI>Ruthen</HI> and Sir <HI>Edward Hastings,</HI> which lasted undetermined from <HI>R.</HI> 2.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bissaeus <HI>in Notis ad</HI> Spelmanni Aspilog. <HI>p.</HI> 95.</NOTE> time to 11 <HI>H.</HI> 4. when judgement I think was given in it, from which there was Appeal to the King, by reason of which it rested litigious till
<PB N="585" REF="303">
<HI>Henry the Sixth</HI>'s time: but this being but in a case of Arms, reaches not the instance of our Text, which charges <HI>France</HI> in the High Court of Parliament (which ought to be the readiest and more effectual Court of dispatch) to be in so great a degree dila|tory, that Plaintiffs had better lose their cause then sue for it, and Defendants answer the Demands of it then defend it in that Court, where not onely there are detentions of suit without Judgement thirty years in some cases and ten in other, but those charge|able evils brought upon Subjects, for seeking remedies of small evils, the remedies whereof have been worse then the diseases, witness the allegation of the Chancellour, who in the Text recites a case of one in <HI>Paris,</HI> who for a right of eight pence <HI>English</HI> in Rent, eight years in the Parliament of <HI>Paris</HI> prosecuted the detainer of it, and all in vain, for as the words are, <HI>Nec speravit se in octo aliis annis se judicium obtentu|rum.</HI> Many other such cases of <HI>ruining Delay</HI> I have my self been acquainted with from those, whom I could name if it were convenient, who have been undone or at least un|repairably maimed by Suits in the Parliament of <HI>Paris</HI>: so that true our Chancellour conceives it to be <HI>Angliae Leges non tant as ut mihi visum est dilationes sortiuntur ut fa|ciunt Leges Regionis illius</HI>] which is confirmed by the prementioned Statutes made a|gainst <HI>Delay,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">4 Instit. <HI>p.</HI> 67. <HI>c.</HI> 6.</NOTE> and particularly by the 14 <HI>E.</HI> 3. <HI>c.</HI> 5.

<Q><P>Sed revera pernecessarium est, dilationes fieri in Processibus Actionum omnium, dum|modo ipsae non fuerint excessivae.</P></Q>
<P>This the Chancellour asserts not to gratifie delayes of <HI>Subtilty,</HI> but delayes of <HI>Secu|rity</HI> and <HI>Discovery</HI>; for many things are either composed or conquered by time, which in Post-hastes are lost and infeasible: which is the reason that there are such steps and gradations to judgement, that when ever it is gained it may appear to be after <HI>Consi|deratum est per Curiam,</HI> and after all, that diligence on both sides could inform the Court by, has been used. As therefore the Law does grant Essoines in certain cases, as hereafter shall be specified; yet those because they are in view of Law Delayes (though not evil-intended ones) shall be restrained as much as possible. <HI>Item, It is accorded and established, that it shall not be commanded by the Great-seal nor the Little|seal to disturb or delay common Right,</HI> so sayes the Statute, 2 <HI>E.</HI> 3. <HI>c.</HI> 8.

<Q><P>Nam sub illis, partes &amp; maxim&egrave; pars rea, quam saepe sibi provident de defensionibus utilibus, similiter &amp; consiliis, quibus ali&acirc;s ipsi carerent.</P></Q>
<P>Though the Law provides not for the guilty person, as he is an offender against the Law, to answer which the Plaintiff compells him; and therefore ought and is rather favoured in tryals then the Defendant: yet that the equity and impartiality of the Justice of the Law may appear, the Text sayes, that Delayes are useful and good as they steed all parties, even the guilty side with discoveries and improvement of men and things to its vindication and defence. For as it is the noblest victory that is obtain|ed in a field foughten, and against an enemy disputing terms <HI>ultimis viribus</HI>; so is that the most creditable decision and judgement on causes and persons, which is after the causes and persons have not been surprised, and had all convenient latitude to free and evince their sentence and condemnation: Then then the sentence of the Law is most clear and justified. And hence come the unavoidable Delayes of the Law, Delayes do
<PB N="584" REF="304">
I terme them, rather deliberations of the Law. (For delay being a word taken in the worst sense, is not properly attributable to the Law, which is <HI>ars aequi &amp; boni</HI>) but when the Law seems to be guilty of it, 'tis to be charged on Men the Lawyers, not on their Mistriss the Law, for the Law is precisely against delay, wherein then it does not speed processes, as eager persons desire, proceeds from the wisdom resident in it, which dictates to doe all things by deliberation, to a just and not to be repented of conclusion. And Magistrates who are in love with Justice, as that <GAP DESC="foreign">, which becomes the wearing of reigning <HI>Darius's.</HI> (I allude to the Story in <HI>Strabo,</HI> which tells us, that because <HI>Syloson</HI> having a garment that <HI>Darius</HI> when a private man loved,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 14.

This is the Chancellours sense, that the Law of <HI>England,</HI> and the <HI>Iudges</HI> in it, are therefore so blessed by God in the accomodation of their integrities, with Monuments of tempo|ral eternity, <HI>their posterities in Name, Fortune, and Honour,</HI> because they doe not, either precipitate or retard justice, but so proceed upon Tryal to Sentence, that during the pendence of the cause, there is time given <HI>recte consulere, perite defendere, utiliter consummare,</HI> what is pertinent, if not to their total vindication, yet at least to their mitigation in point of judgement.</P>

This I say a Judge being enabled to doe and not according to his enablement doing is much to be blamed. And this our Text instances in, to minde how dangerous suddenness is. For here was a woman accused and condemned for murther of her husband, and bur|ned therefore, who was clear of it, and that by the confesson of a servant that did it, and owned afterward the fact, who besides that he charged himself onely with it, and was deservedly executed for it, did purge the woman executed from all hand in and all knowledge of it; <HI>Magistram suam uxorem ejus tunc combustam innocentem omnino fu|isse de morte ejus</HI>] So are the words of the Text which shew not onely a plenary pur|gation of her, that was so speedily concluded the Murtherer; but also a sad sentence on himself for suffering an Innocent person to be condemned for his offence, which was accompanied also with such a terrour to the Judge, that he never clawed it off (as we use to say) but had the memory of it before his eyes, as his daily terrour and a|mazement.

The Monarchs of <HI>England</HI> have ever had great encouragement as to rule by the Lawes, so to know the Lawes they are to rule by. For as that of <HI>Vegetius</HI> quoted by Saint <HI>Thomas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 3. <HI>De Regi|mine Principum: cap.</HI> 21. <HI>p.</HI> 322.</NOTE> or <HI>Aegidius Romanus</HI> is true, that a Souldier is heartned on to battel when he has fit armes, and competent knowledge to use them, when he knowes what he enterprises and delights in it, as it is the object of his intellect and by reason thereof is not strange to him, <HI>quia nemo facere metuit quod se bene didicisse confidit</HI> as the Text's words are] So is it in Government. No Magnetique is more potent, no inducement more cogent, then Lawes of reverence to Princes and punishments of the contrary, then power to defend, protect, order, re|ward, punish, all which being due to Princes by the Law of <HI>England,</HI> they have great encouragement to <HI>adorn their Province,</HI> to go on couragiously, and to proceed to know more and more of the Law, which is thus a buckler to them, and a beautify|er of them. For though as I wrote before in the Notes on the eighth Chapter, a Prince is not to be expected so furnished with <HI>discreta determinataque peritia &amp; scientia</HI>] as a Justice has need to be; yet in the nature and forme, in the general and inchoate knowledge of it, he must have insight. For as those passages of Fathers and Scriptures which require in a Prince <HI>Scripturarum Divinarum peritiam</HI>] and ascribe to a Prince infallible knowledge,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prov.</HI> 16.12.</NOTE> according to that of the <HI>Wiseman A Divine sentence is

I say, though to be scientifique to this proportion be the glory of them; yet, <HI>Earum in confuso de|gustare sententias</HI>] less proportions in our Chancellour's sense would have creditably adorned them, because they have Councils <HI>in Sacris,</HI> whose place it is to know the more cryptique parts of Scripture knowledge:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>ad</HI> Attic. <HI>lib.</HI> 1.13. 1 <HI>Offic.</HI> 118.</NOTE> so that Princes need not <HI>Vitam pro|fundere, omnes nervos intendere, &amp; omnem ingenii vim applicare,</HI> as <HI>Tully</HI> phrases it; not are Princes to be put upon such exactnesses as reside in those who endeavour to do by sacred science, as he in <HI>Plautus</HI> is brought in, saying, <HI>Ejus nunc Regiones,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Panul.</HI> 2.</P>
