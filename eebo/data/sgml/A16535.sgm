<P>This is for to be an aw-band aboue the heads of all men, least they should sinne in any particular ma|ner against God, <HI>wee faile all in ma|ny things:</HI> If it had beene said heere, Fooles because of their extortions or of adulteries are afflicted, the proud Pharisee would thinke to goe free:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Luke.</HI> 18. v. 11.</NOTE> <HI>Lord I thanke thee,</HI> said hee, <HI>that I am not lyke other men,</HI> who are a|dulterers, extortioners, &amp;c. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> But was hee free of pryde or of hypo|crisie?

of trangressours: David was not an idolater, but hee was an adulterer, that was his transgression.
