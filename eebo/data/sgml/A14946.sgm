The whych spyryte and mynde the more precyous, it is then the bodye, the more daungerous be hys sores and syknes, and the more thancke worth the cure thereof, For a well quyeted mynde to a troubled bodye, yet maketh quyetnes, and sycknes of bodye or losse of goodes is not muche paynfull, to hym that estemeth it not, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">aketh it pacyently.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>That all trouble and af|fliccion cometh from God.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_I Call all that, trouble and affliccyon, what|soeuer is reputed to be co~trary to y^e desyre and appetite of mans na|ture, as the vnquyete suggestio~s of the flesh, the temptacions of the deuyll, syckenes of body, a wycked and frowarde mate in matrimony, to haue disobedient children, vnkynd and vnthanful frendes, losse of goodes, to be depryuyd of any old liberty
<PB REF="10">
or priuiledge losse or blemish of name and fame, the malyce &amp; displeasure of me~, ho~|ger, dearth, pestylens, warre, imprisone|ment and death. And in this regyster do I put al kyndes of crosses and affliccio~s, whether they be bodyly or ghostlye, oure own or our frendes, priuate &amp; singular or vniuersal &amp; general, pryuy &amp; secret or ope~ &amp; manifest, deserued or vndeserued. In al such thinges, I saye, euery Christen man ought first of al to co~sider the very roote, grou~d, &amp; beginning, after this wise. That al thinges whatsoeuer God sendeth, we ought to take &amp; receiue the~ paciently. For this is ones true that god is our creator &amp; maker, &amp; we his workema~ shyp, he is our kyng, our Lord &amp; father. And lyke as it is not semyng that the put should murmur <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. ix</NOTE> agaynst the po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">maker, euen so is it much lesse co~uenient that we should murmur &amp; grudge against Gods wil and iudgeme~t Ro. ix. And although trouble &amp; affliccion ryseth and spryngeth often tymes by the wyckednes of enemies and thorowe the instigacyon of the deuell or els by some other meane, yet ought we neuer to yma|gyne that it cometh by fortune or chau~ce wythout the permyssyon, sufferance, de|mynacyon
<PB REF="10">
and wyll of God, but by and wyth the fore knowledge, prouydence, and appoyntement of god. And to speake properly, concernynge safegard, it is all one (su that we tempte not God) whether we lyue in pouertye, or in ryches, in the fyre or in the water, among our enemies, or among our frendes, seynge that God seyth, knowyth, dysposyth, and rulyth all thynges. As wytnessyth the fyrste booke <NOTE PLACE="marg">i. re. ij. b. deu. xxxij Sa. xvi. c Tob. xiij</NOTE> and seconde chapter of the kynges. The Lord bryngeth death, and restoreth again vnto lyfe, bryngeth into the graue and rai seth vp agayn, puttyth downe and exal|teth also. And Iob also testyfyeth in hys myserye, the Lorde dyd geuen it, and the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob. iij</NOTE> Lord hath taken it agayne. And Christ in the tenth of Mathewe, There falleth not a sparrow vpon the earth wythoute your fathers wyll, yea the heares of your head are all u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">mbied.</P>
<P>Seyng then that al our troubles &amp; afflic cions come from God, we ought to hum ble &amp; submit our hartes and mindes vnto the obedience of god, and to suffer him to worck w^t vs according vnto his most holy wil and pleasure. Wherfore whensoeuer vnseasonable whether shall hurte and
<PB REF="11">
peryshe the corne and fruite of the earth, or when a wycked man shall mysreporte vs or rayse vp anye slaunder of vs, why should we murmur &amp; grudge against the eleme~tes or go about to reuenge vs of our enemies? For if we lift not vp oure min|des &amp; consyder, that God laieth his hand vpon vs, &amp; that it is he that stryketh vs, we are euen lyke vnto dogges and no bet ter, which if a man do cast a stone at the~, wyll byte the stone wythout any respecte who dyd cast the stone. And again no ma~ <NOTE PLACE="marg">mat. xxv</NOTE> ought to be vnwilling or disco~tent to ren|der againe that talent or pledge, y^t was co~mitted to him onely, to reserue &amp; kepe. It is that God, that geueth vs lyfe, helth of body, strength, wyfe, children, frendes riches, honor, power, auctorite, peace, rest &amp; quietnes, for a time, so longe as plea|seth him. Now if the same God wil take again some of these things, or al, he taketh nothing, but his owne, &amp; euen that which we did owe vnto him. For y^t which cause to murmur against his wil, &amp; to stryue a|gainst his iudgeme~t, it can not be but an heynous and a greuous synne.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>&para; That trouble and affliccyon and ad|uersyte
<PB N="iij" REF="11">
are sent vnto vs of God, euen for the punishment of our synnes.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>NOw what thing moueth or cau|seth god, to send home vnto vs &amp; visite vs w^t affliccio~, trouble &amp; ve xacion? concerning this point marke this wel. Whatsoeuer anye ma~ hath merited &amp; deserued that ought he to beare &amp; to suf|fer willingly &amp; gladly. Let euery man ap pose &amp; examine him selfe whether he hath not deserued to be correcte &amp; chastened of god, (if it be not for any special thing at y^t present insta~t,) yet for other sins co~mitted at other times. Now wil our lord god in al maner of punishme~tes &amp; visitacio~s, de|clare y^t order of his rightuousnes &amp; his he up wrath &amp; indignacio~ against sinne &amp; wic kednes: for he saith in y^t. ij. co~maundeme~t: I y^t lord which am thy god, am a gelous &amp; an ernest god, &amp; I wil visyte the sinnes of the fathers vpon the children, euen vntill the third &amp; fourth generacion, if they hate <NOTE PLACE="marg">Exo. xx</NOTE> &amp; contemne me. <Q>And in the. xxviij. chap. of the. v. boke of Moises, are all y^e plages rehersed one after another, whych shal be poured out vpo~ the wicked &amp; vngodly, &amp; in the. xiij. of Luke it is said thus.</Q> If ye do not amend ye shal al perish: &amp; y^t we may
<PB REF="12">
perceiue eue~ before our eyes euide~tly how that punishme~t &amp; plages are the dewe re warde vnto synne, God temperyth &amp; fra|myth the punishment, eue~ like vnto y^e syn <NOTE PLACE="marg">God pu+nysheth syn with like syn. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">. Re. xi</NOTE> so that they do both agree together as wel in forme &amp; lykenes, as in proporcion &amp; qua+lyte. As for an example like as Dauid de|fyled Wrias wife, euen so were his wines defiled vnto him again also. He caused W|rias to be slaine &amp; destroied, &amp; therfore did his sonne destroy his own brother again, &amp; stirred a sedicion &amp; vproure, &amp; hunted &amp; droue his father out of hys kingdome, so y^t no man can sufficiently expresse y^e great misery &amp; punishment, y^t Dauid &amp; his peo ple suffered, For the shameful wichednes &amp; abhominacion y^t he had co~mitted. Now co~sider &amp; wey, as it were in a true balance the righteousnes, which god requireth of vs on y^e one syde, &amp; again the whole trade of our life, on the other syde. If the gene|racio~ of mankind had bene co~formable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">n to the law of god, &amp; had not swarued fro~ y^e same it had bene altogether thorowlye happy &amp; blessed euermore, &amp; shulde neuer haue rottyd &amp; dried away like y^e fruit and floures of y^e feld. But it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">waruyd &amp; fel a|way, at y^e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">irst eue~ fro~ the beginning.

despise gods co~maundeme~tes, &amp; so we tho row their fall are corrupt &amp; infected, our reason, senses, &amp; vndersta~ding blinded, &amp; our will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">. We fele &amp; find in vs wicked lustes &amp; affeccions, we seke in the world lust &amp; pleasure, eue~ against y^e holye word of god. And like as if an asse were trimmyd &amp; decked in a lionsskyn &amp; wold nedes be a lyo~, yet his long eares being al wayes vpward, shuld easely descrie &amp; be|wray him. Eue~ so if we adourn garnishe &amp; set furth our selues w^t certe~ glorious bew tiful workes neuer so much, so y^t no ma~ ca~ say but y^t we are vtterly innoce~t &amp; vnc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">l|pable in diuers &amp; many poyntes, yet not w^t standing we haue filthy, vnclene &amp; wic ked hartes, ful of securite &amp; neglect of god altogether geue~ to y^e loue of our selues, &amp; to al maner of dissolutenes.

<P>Adam and Eue when they were put into paradyse, were they not plentuously endued wyth all good thynges? But they could not order nor vse them ryghtly, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">oue of as all can, but assone as we haue all thynges, at pleasure and lack nothing

<P>As we maye take example by our for|sayd fyrst parentes Adam and Eue, when as God was fullye determyned vpon y^t very poynt, to exclude and banishe them out of paradyse: Fyrste he clothed them agaynst the frost and vyolence of the we|ther. And he comforted them also wyth the promes of the blessed sede, whych ma|keth al maner of affliccion, not only easy &amp; harmles, but also holsome &amp; profitable vnto vs. And this same nature doeth the immutable god neuer change but kepeth it co~tynually, he wyll not vtterly forsake vs, but only suffer vs a lytle to smart for the synnes, that we haue committed, and so preserue vs from synne afterwarde, that we runne not into the daunger of eternall payne.</P>
