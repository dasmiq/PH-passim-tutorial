of gentlemen. As I do not alowe
al that be called preachers, so do I
not approue the doinges of al the~
that be called gentlemen. And as
I do not condemne all preachers,
so do I not dispraise all gentleme~.
For as they are, whiche are trewe
<PB REF="34">
preachers in dede, so lykewyse are
ther whiche are true gentlemen in+dede.
But some abuse the name of
preachers, by teaching papistrie, a
nabaptistry, Epicurisme, &amp;c. &amp; are
no prechers in dede, but rather pra+ters
&amp; deceiuers of the people: so
lykewise are ther many which are
called gentleme~, &amp; are no gentleme~
in dede, but pollers and pillers, ra+kers
and catchers, bribers and ex|torcioners,
yea and very caterpil|lers
of the commo~ weale. For they
abuse the name of a gentleman,
whiche is vnfeynedlye a name of
muche worship and great honour,
and worthy to be had in reuerence
and hye estimacion. Wythout the
true gentlema~ the common weale
can no more safely be, then the bo|dye
wythout eyes. For as the eyes
are the principall co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">forte of an

true gentleme~ of the co~mon weale.
<PB REF="34">
And looke what the nose is with|out

iuels to a realme, &amp; as necessari for
the co~seruacio~ of a publike weale,
as fyre, water, and heate is for the

Then is there another sort, which

And they are suche, as this co~|mo~
prouerbe noteth: As ryseth my

thinke al nobilitie to consist in the

nobilitie, not caringe howe
they come by it, so they haue it. All
is fyshe that cometh to the nette:
it is good to be takinge. <HI>Bonus est

weake, to cherishe their nedy tenau~+tes,
neither seke they the co~modity

to posses much,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccle. iii</NOTE> but thei distribute
nothing. Their hande is stretched
<PB REF="36">
out to receiue, but shut when they
shoulde geue. If they once exe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">pe
in to a towne or vyllage, they for
the mooste parte neuer ceasse, tyll
they haue deuoured and eaten vp
the whole toune. What soeuer is
pleasaunte or profitable, muste be
theirs by hoke or by croke. It ly|eth
handsomlye for them &amp; so nere
their nose, though it be a myle of.
If there be either farme or shepe|ground,
vpon the which some ho|nest
pore man liueth, both he and
his familie, oute he muste. Had it
must be whatsoeuer it cost, though
the pore man &amp; all his should go a
begging, it lyeth so co~modiouslye
for our newecome gentleman. If
they bye any tenement, &amp; let it out
againe to the pore man, O how do
they racke it, and stretche out the
rentes therof, almost from a peny
to a pounde? yea and some of them
biynge house and land in a toune,
<PB REF="36">
suffer the houses to falle downe,
and turne the grounde vnto pa|sture,
the poore man not hauynge
where to hyde his head. Who wyl

you againste this sollicitude and
thought taking for the belly, wher+wyth
manye at this presente are

what importune su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">er the bel+lye

therfore continually knocketh at

him in remembraunce to prouide
for her, saiyng: <HI>Adfer, Infer,</HI> bring

continuallye consumeth, wasteth,
but getteth, prouideth nothinge.
Therefore is she full of thoughte
and care for her liuynge, euen as a

beggare is, whiche is so ielouse o|uer
hys drynke, that he wyll not
suffer the lytle flye to sitte vpon

Thys belly care causeth the Law+ers
to corrupte the lawe, the iudge

to be vntrue to their Lordes and

more of value then raymente? Be|hold

<P>Whych of you (thoughe he tooke

vnto his stature? And whye
care ye then for rayment? Consider
the lylies of the fyelde, howe they
growe. They labour not, neyther
spyn. And yet for all that I say vn+to

his royaltie was not arayed lyke
vnto one of these. Wherfore if god
<PB REF="77">
so cloth the grasse, whych is to day
in the field, &amp; to morow shal be cast
into y^e furnace, shall he not muche
more do y^e same vnto you, o ye of ly+tle

saying: what shal we eate, or what
shall we drinke, or wher w^t shal we
be clothed? After all these thinges
seke y^e ge~tiles. For your heaue~ly fa+ther
knoweth that ye haue nede of
all these thynges. But rather seke
ye fyrst the kyngdome of god, and
the ryghteousenes thereof, and all
these thynges shall be caste vnto
you. Behold what goodly and na|tural

&amp; not to be carefull for the

And because we shuld not be care|ful

our eies the foules of y^e ayer for an
example, who~ seing god the father
feedeth so plenteouslie y^t they want

that they neuer lyue after, muche

are not only hys creatures, but al|so

<P>Me thinke the occasion of

liue cleane contrary to the doctrine

malice, in wa~tonnes of lyfe. &amp;c. thei
geue place to none. Another sorte

it shall serue their phansie) nor the

then sende his plages, where
such impiety &amp; vngodlines reigne?
It commeth from gods great mer|cies,

whyche is, that there be no
straunge God amonge vs, nor that
we worshyppe any other God, but
hym alone, whych only is the lorde
our god that deliuered vs oute of

this abundaunce &amp; wealth, we may

These straunge &amp; new founde
