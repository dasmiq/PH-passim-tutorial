<HEAD>Vpon this Choice and Remarkable piece of Historie.</HEAD>
<P>_AMong those various delights and advantages which accrew to a Reader of <HI>Historie,</HI> one is, That no modern accident can seem <HI>strange</HI> unto him, much less <HI>astonish</HI> him: Hee scarce can wonder at any thing, in regard hee may remem|ber to have read of the same, or much like the same, that happened in former times; therefore hee doth not stand staring like a childe at every sudden spectacle, like that simple <HI>American,</HI> who, the first time hee saw a <HI>Spaniard</HI> on hors|back, thought the Man and the Beast to bee but one Creature, and that the hors did chew the Rings of his Bit.</P>
<P>Now indeed, not to bee an Historian, that is, Not to know what Forrein Nations, and our Fore-fathers did, <HI>Hoc est semper esse puerum,</HI> as <HI>Cicero</HI> saith, this is still to bee a childe, who gazeth at any thing; whence may bee inferred, There is no knowledg that ripen's the judgment, and put's one out of his <HI>nonage</HI> sooner then Historie.</P>
<P>If I had not formerly read the <HI>Baron's</HI> Wars in <HI>England,</HI> I had more admired that of the <HI>Liguers</HI> in <HI>France.</HI> Hee who read the near upon fourscore years Wars in <HI>Low Germanie,</HI> never wondred at those thirtie two years late Wars in <HI>High Germanie.</HI> I had more wondred that <HI>Richard</HI> of <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> was knockd down with a halbard, had not I read formerly that <HI>Edward</HI> of <HI>Carnar|van</HI> died of a hot Iron that was thrust up his fundament; It was strange that <HI>Murat</HI> the great <HI>Ottoman</HI> Emperor should bee lately strangled in his own Court; yet considering that <HI>Osman</HI> his predecessor had been knock'd down by an ordinarie slave not many years before, it was not strange at all. The blazing Star in
<PB REF="5">
<HI>Virgo,</HI> 33 years since, did not seem strange to him who had read of that which appeared in <HI>Cassiop&eacute;a,</HI> and other constellations som years before, and how portentous they proved to poor Mortals. Hence may bee inferred, that among all other kindes of contemplations, <HI>Historie</HI> may bee called the great <HI>Looking Glass,</HI> through which wee may see with <HI>Ancestrall</HI> optiques, not onely the various <HI>Actions</HI> of men, and odd <HI>Accidents</HI> of time, but also discern the Constitutions, the Humors, and Genius of Nations.</P>
<P>This faithful piece of Storie will displaie the very intrinse|cals of the <HI>Castillian,</HI> (who entitle's himself to bee the prime <HI>Spaniard</HI>) and make that opinion a meer paradox, whereby hee is cried up to bee so constant to his principles, so loial to his Prince, and so conformable to Government: for it will discover as much levitie and tumultuarie passions in him as in other peo|ple; Which may bee the reason why these Annals were sup|pressed, and called in, in <HI>Spain,</HI> yet procur'd by a Gentleman of qualitie and of exquisite knowledg, and now made <HI>English,</HI> with much exactness and fidelitie; Therefore most worthie of the perusal, beeing a pure <HI>maiden</HI>-storie, never <HI>blown</HI> upon hitherto; for to my knowledg shee never travell'd over the Pyrenean Hills, or cross'd the Seas in any language till now.</P>

<P>_COurteous Reader! if likeness breeds liking, and if in Histories, as in Humane bodies, may bee admitted any Sympathetical ope|rations, I cannot but promiss my self, that this Narration will not bee unwelcom to your curious eies, in regard it doth punctually relate the no less strange, then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rue transactions, betwixt <HI>Charles</HI> the fift in his Minoritie and his Subjects in <HI>Spain,</HI> which had so much similitude to divers late passages in this our Nation, that had not those in <HI>Castilla</HI> had the privilege of many years before us, wee might have been said to have been their pattern, although the suc|cesses are different. The Autor was a man of no mean eminencie, neither for knowledge or extraction, and who (though somwhat violent in his tearms against the Commonaltie by reason of his dependance on the Court of <HI>Spain)</HI> wrote so plainly, and with such impartiali|tie, that all his books were suppressed by especial com|mand from the King, whose Historiographer hee was, which rendereth the truth of the Historie less questionable: Herein, as in our troubles, you shall finde the Clergie-men on both sides no less busie in distracting peoples mindes, then in fomenting and aggravating their unhappie dissentions: Herein you shall see besides the
<PB REF="6">
policies, and subtile correspondencies betwixt the several Cities of that Countrie, the Statutes and Decrees enacted by the Commissioners or Substitutes of the Commonalties assembled in Parlament, after their King's departure into <HI>Germanie,</HI> whither they were sent to bee ratified by him, his answer, and their proceedings afterwards. The names of places, as well as men, are left in <HI>Spa|nish,</HI> becaus they cannot bee so well rendered in any other language, as in their own, and som terms likewise, whereof though our tongue admitteth not of a simple, and direct version, you shall finde them paraphrastically expounded in the margents, therefore I hope you will not impute this as a fault to the Translator, and in case your more penetrating judgment should discover any other defects, my humble supplication is, that you will not bee a Captious, but a Cautious Reader, and careful of the reputation of him, whose chief aim, in this labor, was to procure you both profit and pleasure, as beeing</P>

<P>IN mean time <HI>Don Fernando,</HI> beeing married to the Queen <HI>Germana,</HI> and distasted in <HI>Castillia,</HI> retired himself into <HI>Ara|gon</HI>; from thence beeing upon his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ournie to <HI>Naples,</HI> the <HI>Ca|stilli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ns</HI> gave him notice of <HI>Don Philip's</HI> death, and of the ne|ces<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itie that there was of his <HI>Roial</HI> presence; but hee refused to return, beeing incensed against som of them for their ingra|titude to him. By the death of <HI>Don Philip,</HI> and the absence of <HI>King Fernando,</HI> divers tumults and seditions arose in the <HI>kingdom,</HI> the people refusing to obeie the Magistrates and Of|ficers of Justice; and the Nobles wanted not factions and partialities amongst them to trouble and disquiet the Coun|trie, and almost everie Citie throughout the Kingdom was infected with the same contagion: Som crying up <HI>Charls,</HI> or <HI>Don Carles</HI>; others <HI>Fernando</HI>; no small number stood for <HI>Maximiliano,</HI> but verie few made anie mention of <HI>Donnia Iuana,</HI> who, whether out of a sens of her own disabilitie, or overcom with melancholie for her husbands deceas, had re|tired her self at <HI>Tordesillas,</HI> refusing to govern or trouble her head with State-affairs. Whereupon, with the consent of most part of the <HI>Peers</HI> and Nobles of the <HI>Realm,</HI> the <HI>Cardi|nal Ximenez Don Bernardino de Velasso</HI> Lord high <HI>Constable,</HI> and
<PB N="8" REF="10">
<HI>Don Pedro Manrique Duke</HI> of <HI>Naxara</HI> took upon them the administration of Government for the present; they made <HI>Don Alonso Suarez</HI> Bishop of <HI>Iaen, President</HI> of their Council, assisted by Doctor <HI>Tello, el Licenciado Polanco,</HI> and other learn|ed Lawyers. They called a Parlament, wherein they or|dered to send to <HI>Don Fernando,</HI> desiring him in the name of the Queen and the whole Kingdom to return, and under|take the Government for his Daughter and Grandchilde. Which hee, beeing more readie to accept then they to offer, did not refuse, but returned answer, that having setled the business which had called him to <HI>Naples,</HI> hee would satisfie their desires: And after som time, leaving <HI>Don Iuan de Ara|gon</HI> Earl of <HI>Ribagorsa,</HI> his <HI>Vice-Roy,</HI> hee embarqued himself for <HI>Spain</HI> with his Queen <HI>Germana, Don Gonsalo Fernandez de Cordova,</HI> commonly called the <HI>gran Capitan,</HI> and a great train of <HI>Spanish</HI> Gentlemen that attended him in his voiage. Beeing arrived at <HI>Valentia,</HI> the Queen <HI>Donnia Iuana</HI> went to meet him, whom hee received with signs of much affecti|on and fatherlie tenderness, which shee answered with all the honor and due obedience that could bee exspected from an observant Daughter; for although the excess of sorrow had weakned her intellectual faculties, yet shee never lost her respect to her Father, but paied him with all humilitie and filial dutie; neither was shee ever heard to utter anie mis becoming words, which is common to people tainted with her infirmitie. The eighth of October the <HI>King</HI> and Queens came to <HI>Arcos,</HI> where <HI>Donnia Iuana</HI> desiring to staie, <HI>Don Fernando</HI> went with his Court to <HI>Burges,</HI> leaving her a good number of Noblemen and Ladies, besides guards, suitable to the dignitie of her person.

blood in his aged veins, gave him a certein provocative po|tion; which, instead of raising a part, cast the whole bodie into the grave. After his death, arose manie differences amongst the <HI>Grandees</HI> concerning the Government. <HI>Adriano</HI> (Dean of <HI>Lovain,</HI> and <HI>Tutor</HI> to <HI>Don Carles</HI>) produced a Commissi|on, which the young <HI>Prince</HI> had given him to succeed <HI>Don Fernando</HI> in the Government, until his coming into <HI>Spain</HI>; this was opposed by <HI>Cardinal Ximenez,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dispute about the Govern|ment of the Kingdom.</NOTE> who alleged, that by virtue of his <HI>Catholick Majestie's</HI> last Will and Testament, hee was to bee Governor of the Kingdom, until the <HI>Prince</HI> should com himself, or give som special order to the contrarie&punc; that <HI>Adriano's</HI> Commission was dated long before <HI>Don Fer|dinando's</HI> deceas, therefore not valeable; besides, that hee was a foreigner, which was sufficient reason to bar his preten|sions.

<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<P>_IN this and the following Books, I am to re|late the the Insurrections or rising of the People (commonly called <HI>Communidades,</HI> or <HI>Communalties</HI>) which continued in <HI>Spain,</HI> from the year 1519 to 1522. A Subject, truly, very sad and unpleasant, and which I would willingly pass under silence, becaus som Illustrious Families, Noble Cities, and principal Towns of the King|dom were interessed therein, which never had been disobedi|ent to their <HI>Kings,</HI> but alwaies esteemed for their loialtie. Neither do I conceiv that they thought anie waie to disserv his <HI>Majestie,</HI> but rather to releas him out of that oppression (as I may term it) in which his Favorites held him. And, it is manifest, in that they so earnestly importuned and petitioned, that their <HI>King</HI> would not go out of the Kingdom, that they desired, and delighted to see, and enjoie his Roial presence; which was no sign, that they intended to do him anie disser|vice: It will appear more evidently in the Progress of this Historie, and by the letters which passed between them,
<PB N="28" REF="20">
whereof som I have set down in the same manner, as they were written in the originals, becaus the particularitie of the Historie doth require it, in a matter of such weight and dan|ger. And since the <HI>Loialtie</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> come's in question, who have alwaies had their Princes in so high a reverence, that they honored and respected their verie Statues and pictures, as if they had been their <HI>Sovereign's,</HI> whom they represented: I will, before I go anie further&punc; declare the ground and reasons, upon which the <HI>Castillians</HI> founded their com|plaints and grievances, as I have gathered them from those who were eie-witnesses, and have penn'd all the several pas|sages, with much discretion, respect, fear of God, and with a minde free from partialitie.</P>

<P>THe familiaritie of <HI>Monsieur de Xeures</HI> with the <HI>King</HI> was so great, that hee rather seemed to bee the <HI>King,</HI> and the <HI>King</HI> his <HI>Son,</HI> then to bee <HI>Xeures</HI> his <HI>Vassal</HI> and <HI>Crea|ture,</HI> as hee was. There was no access, nor speaking with the <HI>King,</HI> but when <HI>Xeures</HI> pleased: if anie thing succceded well, <HI>Xeures</HI> assumed the glorie to himself, giving out that hee had don it; if ill, hee alwaies laid the fault upon the <HI>King,</HI> saying, The <HI>King</HI> would have it so. And, indeed, this was the first occasion that begat the innocent <HI>Prince</HI> the ill will of his <HI>People.</HI> I have seen a memorial of these Passages, which a Gentleman (one of the <HI>King's</HI> Domestick servants) wrote, and averreth to have been an eie-witness of them. Hee report's, that while the <HI>King</HI> was yet in his minoritie, and unacquainted with <HI>State-affairs, Xeures</HI> would suffer no bodie to speak with him, unless hee were first informed of the business, that so hee might put into the <HI>King's</HI> mouth, what hee would have him to answer; and if anie refused to impart their business to him, they were so far from having
<PB N="29" REF="20">
audience, that hee would not suffer them to enter into his <HI>Majestie's</HI> presence; Thus did hee deal with those that were sent from <HI>Toledo,</HI> and divers other <HI>Cities.</HI> Indeed, at that time all the <HI>Castillians</HI> were very much discountenanced, and not treated as their's and their Predecessor's services had deserved. The <HI>Flemings</HI> perceived the mindes of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> disposed for all mischief; much ambition, and little friendship bee|ing amongst them: for som devoted themsel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s particularly to <HI>King Ferdinand</HI> the <HI>Catholick,</HI> others to <HI>King Philip</HI> the <HI>Fair.</HI> These were kindes of Factions, wherewith were pos|sessed for som daies the mindes of manie People.</P>
<P><HI>Mercurino Gatinara</HI> Lord high <HI>Chancellor</HI> was second in the <HI>Emperor's</HI> favor, and as the Autoritie and familiaritie with <HI>Princes</HI> admit of no Competitor, <HI>Xeures</HI> and this <HI>Chancellor</HI> could not endure each other: they both presumed so much, that each of them would command alone, and ambitioned a Power above the other; these made themselvs the Heads of those two Factions, and added more poison to their ma|lice and discontents. <HI>Xeures</HI> favored those of <HI>Ferdinando</HI>: and the Chancellor sided with those of <HI>Don Philip's</HI> Partie. And all was ill (as the Proverb saie's) for the poor Pitcher; for the distressed Countrie of <HI>Spain</HI> had all the sufferings. <HI>Xeures</HI> was so corrupt and covetous, that he sold all the King's Favors, <HI>Offices, Bishopricks, Honors,</HI> and whatso&euml;ver hee conceived would yield him money. The <HI>Chancellor</HI> did the like with all <HI>Iustice-ships</HI> and other Offices; so that secluded <HI>Iustice</HI> was enforc'd to give up her Seat, and Sword to the Tyrannie of over-ruling <HI>Avarice</HI>; onely monie then bore the swaie; no <HI>Right,</HI> no <HI>Equitie</HI> was able to counterpoiz the weight of <HI>Gold</HI>; all things and places (as in the times of <HI>Ca|tiline</HI> at <HI>Rome</HI>) were then put to sale: The <HI>Flemings</HI> were much encouraged with this fine gold, and Ingots of pure Silver, that came from the <HI>Indies</HI>; and the <HI>simple Spaniards</HI> so blinde, in giving it for their pretensions, that it became as common, as a Proverb, for a <HI>Fleming</HI> to call a <HI>Spaniard, My Indian.</HI> And, indeed, it was not improper, for the <HI>Indians</HI> never gave so
<PB N="30" REF="21">
much gold to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> did to the <HI>Fle|mings</HI>: this in time grew to such a pass, that it was pub|lickly sung along the streets,
<Q><L>Double Pistol, it's well for thee,</L>
<L>That from <HI>Xeures</HI> thou art free.</L></Q>
It is reported that a certain <HI>Pretendent,</HI> or Petitioner who had presented <HI>Xeures</HI> with a very handsom <HI>Mule,</HI> and hee beeing asked by another Gentleman, where hee had gotten that curious beast, answered, That hee knew not who had gi|ven it him; beeing within hearing, and very much ag|grieved to see himself so soon forgotten, and the business hee had communicated to <HI>Xeures</HI> so neglected, give's forth|with order to have his <HI>Mule</HI> cried, declaring all his marks, and describing the furniture hee had bestowed on him; which the same Gentleman hearing of, went presently, and told <HI>Xeures,</HI> that according to the marks, it must needs bee that this <HI>Mule</HI> had been stolen; Thus the poor Petitioner re|covered what hee had given him, and lost not all, as most men do in such occurrences: for there is no memorie so weak, as that of a covetous man in Power, who digest's gold with more facililitie, then Estriches do Iron.</P>

<P>THere was no monie to bee got in the whole Kingdom, but pieces of nine <HI>Marauediz,</HI> which is three half|pence English, for all better coins <HI>Xeures</HI> had transported&punc; What shall I saie? Besides that which was ship't for <HI>Flanders</HI> from <HI>Barcelona,</HI> beeing 750 Millions; from the <HI>Groyne,</HI> 950 Millions; and from other parts, 800 Millions; so that it exceeded the number of twentie five hundred millions; which was enough to make him equal to the most power|ful and richest King. But consider in what condition did poor <HI>Castillia</HI> remain after such a dreining. Besides all this,
<PB N="31" REF="21">
the <HI>Flemings</HI> held the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">paniards</HI> in so mean esteem, that they insulted over them as if they had been their slaves, or rather beasts; they would break open their houses at their plea|sures, abuse their wives in their own presence, carrie away their goods, and no Justice to bee had against them. It hap|ned that a <HI>Castillian</HI> having killed a <HI>Fleming</HI> at <HI>Valladolid,</HI> took Sanctuare in S^t <HI>Marie Magdalen's</HI> Church; Som <HI>Flemings</HI> violently breaking in upon him, and stabbing him in divers places, there made him a sad sacrifice to their revengeful fu|rie; which don, they went cleer away unchastiled, unque|stioned; That which bred the People's greatest dislike of their <HI>King,</HI> was, that they could not bee admitted into his Presence, treat with him, nor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o much as know him: For <HI>X<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es</HI> would suffer no bodie to speak with him; if at anie time hee did give audience, <HI>Xeures</HI> would still bee at his el|bow, and in regard hee did not throughly understand the <HI>Spanish</HI> Tongue, hee seemed as if hee had not been spoken to. This gave the rise of the People's general ill opinion of him: They presently spake him a man of a weak apprehension, and of an ill disposition, they call'd him <HI>Dutchman,</HI> and an Enemie to <HI>Spaniards</HI>; They said, hee wanted Judgment as well as years, neither was hee of a Talent fit to govern: by these prejudicial Censures of their <HI>Prince,</HI> which were for som time generally noised abroad amongst the People, like|ning him to his Mother: Som that never had seen him, said, It could not bee otherwise; and that, for that respect onely, <HI>Xeures</HI> would suffer no bodie els to confer with him, lest hee should too much discover his own imperfections. Others that had been admitted to speak with him, much vin|dicated his honor in that particular, protesting, That they found him verie discreet, and of no mean capacitie; That hee was no way guiltie of those pretended weaknesses, but his Favorites infinitely to bee condemn'd; neither was it to bee wondered at, if hee suffered himself to bee governed by them, in regard hee was but a youth, and unacquainted with the Customs of that Countrie, and the dispositions of
<PB N="32" REF="22">
the People. Those that have near relations about the Persons of <HI>Kings,</HI> ought to bee verie careful and circumspect, how to avoid the occasions of Murmurings and Envie, consi|dering, that <HI>Kings</HI> are like that Sun which diffuseth his light to all.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. IIII.</HEAD>
<P>THe whole Countrie of <HI>Castillia</HI> was imbrued with these factious discourses, before they ever thought of the departure of their <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Emperor,</HI> as will appear by the Letters, which were interchangeably sent from Citie to Ci|tie. But when they heard of his resolution to bee gon, and that his calling of a Parlament would en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">reas their Contri|butions and Taxes, they out-stript the bounds of patience. The principal Causses of their Commotions were these three ensuing: First, to see the <HI>King</HI> go out of that Kingdom, bee|ing alwaies accustomed to keep their Courts in <HI>Spain</HI>; for when <HI>King Alonso</HI> the Wise deserted it, out of an ambitious covetousness of possessing th' <HI>Imperial Scepter,</HI> hee not onely lost that Kingdom, but was incumbred with insurrections, not of the Common people, but of <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Princes,</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t levied arms against him. Their second grievance was, To see all Offices, and places of Honor, Trust, or Profit, con|ferred upon strangers. The third was an universal crying out, That the <HI>Treasure</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> was all transported into fo|reign Nations. And wee may add for a fourth Reason, That in that verie occurrence, som evil Star dispersed the maligni|tie of it's influence over all <HI>Castillia, Sardinia, Sicilia</HI> and <HI>Austria,</HI> which at one instant were all infected with the same poison, as if they had all conspired and agreed together. This they made the ground of their insurrections; becaus their King left them to live in a strange Countrie; becaus their wealth was exhausted, and their Countrie impoverished, to inrich foreigners; and becaus the high <HI>Treasurer-ship</HI> was given to
<PB N="33" REF="22">
<HI>Xeures,</HI> and the <HI>Arch-Bishoprick</HI> of <HI>Toledo</HI> to <HI>William de Croy,</HI> his Nephew, and all presentations to spiritual preferments, and other Offices to strangers; But that which they chiefly resented was the <HI>King's</HI> going to the <HI>Empire,</HI> and had they really wished him ill in his own person, they would not have been so sensible of his departure.</P>
<P>I cannot let pass with silence the audacitie of a certain gentleman of those parts, named, The <HI>Martial Don Pedro,</HI> who refused to swear Alleageance to <HI>Charls,</HI> as <HI>King,</HI> alledging, that in regard hee was not born in <HI>Spain,</HI> nor descended from the blood of the <HI>Castillian Kings,</HI> by the Father's side, hee was not obliged to acknowledg him, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Martial Don Pedro</HI> re|fuseth the Oath of Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ance.</NOTE>but, like a true <HI>Castillian,</HI> to keep strictly that Oath, and Loialtie to his Countrie, and the precedent <HI>Kings.</HI> Upon which words hee was appre|hended, his goods confiscate, and his person committed close prisoner in the Castle of <HI>Atienza.</HI> The <HI>Emperor</HI> after this coming to <HI>Valladolid,</HI> sent for him, and promised him, that if hee would yet take the Oath, hee should not onely bee enlarged, but bee restored to the quiet possession of his whole estate, as formerly, which favor beeing refused, hee was thence carried to the Castle of <HI>Simancas,</HI> where hee ended his life through his own indiscreet obstinacie. Som men through a desperate fool-hardiness think it a piece of cou|rage and gallantrie to precipitate themselvs into the most eminent dangers.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Worshipful, Noble, and most Virtuous Sirs!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN regard somtimes wee have written to you in particular, you may wonder why wee now write to you all in general: But considering the imminent necessitie that there is in this case, and the danger that may ensue by deferring anie longer; wee shall rather bee condemn'd as beeing too slack for not doing it before, then thought importunate for doing it now. You know, and may remember, how vehemently <HI>King Charls</HI> our <HI>Soeverign Lord's</HI> arrival in <HI>Spain</HI> was desired of all, and how sudden is his departure from us; his absence now is no less torment to Us, then his Presence at that time afforded us de|light and comfort; the long continuance of his <HI>Roial</HI> Person in the Kingdom of <HI>Aragon,</HI> and the small time hee hath vouchsafed to re|side in this our kingdom of <HI>Castillia,</HI> hath been a great occasion that the affairs of this kingdom are yet in so unsettled a condition: And if his <HI>Majestie</HI> doth go away, as hee hath determined, the longer wee delaie, the wors our case will bee. Therefore (Sirs!) our opinion is, if you think good, since the damage is universal, That 'twere con|venient, that wee should all meet and consult upon a remedie; the bu|siness is of no small moment, besides, in manie other particular things (Sirs!) wee finde an extreme necessitie of your advise, and after your advise wee shall have as much need of your favor, and helping hands.

Sirs, wee beg thus much favor of you, that having read our Letter, you forth|with send us your answer; for it is necessarie, that those who are to car|rie our Messages should go together, and make their Propositions all at once; for our demands beeing in the names of the whole kingdom, wee

<P>The contents of this short Letter were much approved of by the Readers; but in that Occurrence of time they were of dangerous consequence, for the ill managing of the affairs of <HI>Castillia</HI> was generally much resented, and this Letter bred no mean varietie of thoughts in the alreadie wounded hearts of the suffering People; it did this mischief, that all men suspecting wors evils, unanimously said, Since <HI>Toledo lift's up the hand, som great disaster must befal this Kingdom.</HI> They all returned their answers, although the Citie of <HI>Burgos</HI> dis|approved their general meeting; <HI>Granada</HI> answered, that they should do better to exspect another opportunitie, and carrie a more specious form. <HI>Salamanca</HI> and <HI>Murcia</HI> were not backwards in their promises and fair offers, but they did not agree in that particular, touching the general <HI>Assem|blie,</HI> yet all wrote that they would send their <HI>Burgesses,</HI> as <HI>Agents,</HI> who in the <HI>Parlament</HI> should bee conformable to the <HI>Toledians.

<P>SOon after was publisht through the whole kingdom, the <HI>Emperor's</HI> determination to go into <HI>Germanie,</HI> to receiv
<PB N="36" REF="24">
the <HI>Imperial Crown</HI>; Everie one lamented his departure, out of a presaging fear, that those so long contracted fogs of murmuring Discontent, condensing more and more through the privation of his resplendent presence, might at last break forth into som furious storm of intestine Commoti|ons, to the ruine of their whole Countrie; Which Consi|deration meeting with the complaints, and general grie|vances of the whole Kingdom, they began at length to mut|ter out their resentments in these following words. That the <HI>King</HI> shewed verie small affection to that Countrie; and despising it as too mean for him, would betake himself wholly to <HI>Germanie.</HI> That <HI>Xeures</HI> had robbed <HI>Spain</HI> of all her Treasure; That the <HI>King</HI> beeing at <HI>Burgos</HI> (<HI>Capital Citie of Castillia</HI>) did not staie one week there. That <HI>Xeures</HI> would not have the <HI>Parlament</HI> to bee in <HI>Valladolid,</HI> although all the <HI>Gran|dees,</HI> and divers others of the Kingdom had petitioned for it. That <HI>Don Pedro Giron</HI> had given the <HI>King</HI> som unbe|seeming Language, which hee thought good to put up, be|caus hee was not man enough to punish his temerarious au|dacitie. That <HI>Xeures</HI> had called a <HI>Parlament,</HI> but for no other end, then to charge the Kingdom with a new Cessment of four hundred thousand Duckets. From these and such other seeds of discontents sown amongst the Common People, grew suddenly a multitude of turbulent Imaginations in their factious hearts; and the seditious <HI>Clergie,</HI> casting the oil of their, pretended, Religious Doctrine into the fire of the People's ill-grounded zeal, made the flame blaze the higher, pricking them daily forwards with their sacrilegious Exhor|tations in the Pulpits, in these or like words&punc; <HI>Why do you, that are a Free born Nation, suffer such exorbitancies? Why do you suffer strangers to reap the fruits of your labors, in your own Coun|trie? You have not yet fully paid the Cessment, that was granted to the King in the last Parlament; and yet hee will impose more Taxes on you, till hee hath swept this kingdom clean, and quite beggar'd us, to inrich his Germane Nation; and there's</HI> Xeures, <HI>who was but a private Gentleman in Flanders, hath made himself one of the richest men in the world, by the spoils of us</HI> Castillians.</P>

<P>THe <HI>Emperor</HI> beeing at <HI>Valladolid,</HI> and the People's mindes much distracted with these several grievances, hee sent for the <HI>Corregidores, Regidores,</HI> and all other Publick Magi|strates to his Palace. Upon their appearance hee told them that beeing then to go into <HI>Germanie,</HI> to receiv the <HI>Imperial Crown,</HI> hee was in great distress for want of monies to de|fraie his charges, to which hee desired, they would not onely give their consents, but bee assistant in the raising of three hundred <HI>Millions</HI> of <HI>Marauediz,</HI> which might bee easi|ly don in <HI>Castillia,</HI> by waie of <HI>Subsidie</HI> and <HI>Pole-monie,</HI> everie Town paying according to their qualitie and Cessments; Presuming, that if those of <HI>Valladolid</HI> subscribed, the other places of the Kingdom, would not bee backwards to an|swer his exspectation; And in case they did satisfie his de|sires therein&punc; hee promised to grant them all the Favors their <HI>Burgesses</HI> or <HI>Commissioners</HI> should demand of him in <HI>Parlament.</HI> There was present at this Conference, the <HI>Arch|Bishop</HI> of <HI>Santjago,</HI> the <HI>Bishop Mota,</HI> the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Venavente,</HI> the <HI>Marquis</HI> of <HI>Astorga,</HI> and <HI>Xeures</HI> who was never from the <HI>Emperor's</HI> elbow. Those of <HI>Valladolid</HI> desired som time to give in their answer, but (they said) They could see no pos|sibilitie of effecting what the <HI>Emperor</HI> demanded of them. Thence began tumultuous <HI>meetings</HI> in the streets, <HI>Conventicles,</HI> and outragious <HI>murmurings,</HI> insomuch that they were even readie to rise in arms against the <HI>Flemings.</HI> At last <HI>Valladolid</HI> returned the <HI>Emperor</HI> this answer, That they humbly desired his <HI>Majestie</HI> would bee pleased to staie, and make his resi|dence in their Countrie, and that upon those terms hee should not onely command the three hundred Millions hee desired, but they would furnish him with much more, and if need required, they would not stick to part with their
<PB N="38" REF="25">
lands and goods, but fell their Children also to do him ser|vice. But, in their opinions, that hee should go away and deprive the kingdom of his <HI>Roial</HI> Person, besides, that vast summe monie which hee desired to carrie into forreign Countries, seemed verie unreasonable, and they would sell nothing to further anie such designe, neither did they be|liev that <HI>God</HI> required they should paie him anie such obe|dience. Upon this answer of <HI>Valladolid,</HI> there were several meetings and Consultations, but they prevailed nothing. But the <HI>Emperor's</HI> Favorites, (against whom <HI>Castillia</HI> was chiefly incensed) <HI>Viz. Xeures, Don Garzia de Padilla,</HI> and <HI>Mota, Bishop</HI> of <HI>Badajos,</HI> went again to the Magistrates, desiring them that they would consider well upon his <HI>Majestie's</HI> demands, since the performance thereof was so important to his pre|sent service, and so easie for them to accomplish: that the necessitie of his going to receiv the <HI>Imperial Crown</HI> was ex|tremely urgent, and redounded not a little to the reputation and honor of that Kingdom. That they should look upon what <HI>Castillia</HI> had furnished to <HI>King Alonso</HI> the <HI>Wise,</HI> when hee went into <HI>Germanie</HI> upon a pretended claim of the <HI>Empire,</HI> and how much more reason they had to do the like now, (which they might well do, the Kingdom beeing in a far better condition.) That the <HI>King</HI> undertook not that voi|age, as <HI>Don Alonso</HI> did, upon a doubtful matter, his business was already most certainly concluded and agreed upon. This was closely followed, for during the three daies time which the <HI>Emperor</HI> staied in <HI>Valladolid,</HI> The <HI>Gentrie, Magistrates, and Burgesses</HI> of the Town, with <HI>Bishop Mota</HI> (whom the <HI>Em|peror</HI> had sent, to entreat them to condescend to his desires) did nothing els all daie and night, but go from the Court to the Town-hous, and back again; the Bishop of <HI>Osma, Don Alonso Enriques</HI> and som of the Magistrates were of opinion, that they should do well to satisfie his <HI>Majestie's</HI> desires. Others stood strongly to the contrarie, and turned their Op|ponents out from their consultation, with manie reviling words, calling them disloial, disobedient, and other injuri|ous

The third daie that his <HI>Majestie</HI> was there, It beeing divulged to and fro in the Citie, that the Magistrates had consented to and subscribed the <HI>Emperor's</HI> demands, The People cried out, <HI>That ought not to bee suffred.</HI> The <HI>Emperor</HI> beeing informed of all these passages, was very much perplext, and gave order presently to prepare for his departure. It is r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ported that hee said, hee desired no more then that consentment, and those subscriptions which som of the Magistrates had given in, As for the rest, who had refused, hee should take his time to bee even with them.

The <HI>Emperor</HI> gave them a gracious answer, thanking them for their good wishes, but (hee said) it was expedient for him to depart without anie further delaie, for the good and advancement of that Kingdom, and hee promissed them, that assoon as hee had received the <HI>Imperial Crown,</HI> hee would com back again, at the farthest within three years.

<HI>Valladolid,</HI> bearing date the 8^t^h of June of this year 1520. de|claring (to the same effect as in the former) the great necessi|tie, into which the absence of their <HI>King</HI> would plunge the Countrie, and the great inconveniences that were likely to proceed from that occasion. That it was expedient, that all the <HI>Cities</HI> of the Kingdom should make an <HI>Assemblie,</HI> and consult what were best to bee don in a case of such high con|sequence;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">do</HI> write's to <HI>Vallad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lid.</HI></NOTE> That they would consider of the manner and place of meeting; That they would conform themselvs to <HI>Valladolid,</HI> and that <HI>Valladolid</HI> should communicate the mat|ter to the bordering Towns and Cities.

that you desire to remedie anie thing touching this King|dom or that Citie, send your messengers or <HI>Commissioners</HI> to the <HI>Governor,</HI> and those of the <HI>Council,</HI> and wee will procure them a free arrival hither, protect them while they staie here, and obtein them a safe conduct back again, to which wee doubt not but the <HI>Governor</HI> will easily condescend, and wee will also join with them in all that is just and lawful.

<P>THese private Treaties increased daily the publick re|sentments, and the more in respect of the <HI>King's</HI> de|mands, and his so unexspected determination to leav that Countrie.

They urged moreover that it was most expedi|dient,
<PB N="42" REF="27">
that forthwith Letters should bee dispatched to all the Cities of the Kingdom (that had Vote in Parlament) to incite them to assemble in som place convenient for their treating upon the forementioned remedies. That there should im|mediately bee sent a Petition to the <HI>King</HI>; beseeching him not to depart the Kingdom, but that hee would bee pleased to give som Order for the remedying, and better managing of Affairs. That, in case his Majestie would not, the King|dom intended to indeavor it, and would more narrowly see into that which concerned the Common good. These and divers such like things were that daie there propounded. And in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">egard they carried a specious apparence of the Pub|lick Good, which was so generally desired, throughout the whole Kingdom, the Major part of the <HI>Assemblie</HI> was of opinion, That it was most fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ting and convenient so to do. But som dissented (though they were the fewer in number) fearing that if the affairs were carried on in that manner (al|though under colour of the Common good) they would produce very sad consequents, neither were they satisfied of the lawfulness of the Citie's assembling such <HI>Iunta's,</HI> without the <HI>King's</HI> licence and autoritie <HI>Antonio Alvares de Toledo,</HI> an anci|ent gentleman of that Citie, Lord of <HI>Cedillo,</HI> and som others, which leaned to his faction, were of this opininion, either out of desire to do the <HI>King</HI> service, or becaus they could not agree with the rest, (for such kinde of sidings have pro|duced a world of mischief in all places) or that like prudent men and free from passion, they fore-saw with clearer eies, the danger that would ensue th'assembling of the Cities without the King's Autoritie; They gave their Votes against writing to the Cities, declared against all publick, or parti|cular meetings in that kinde, and said openly, that in case there were a necessitie of rectifying anie thing, they should in an honest and humble manner petition the <HI>Emperor</HI> to take it into his consideration. Whereto those of the contrarie Judgment made several replies. After long debate and con|tention about this matter, at last those few, which were of

the most safe and wholesom opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Corregidor</HI> is as our Majors are in Eng|land.</NOTE> protested and re|quired according to that which they had voted, that the <HI>Corregidor</HI> and Citie would take an especial care what they did,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dissentions in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">emblie at <HI>Toledo.</HI></NOTE> as for their parts they absolutely disapproved of <HI>Iohn de Padilla's</HI> and the other Gentlemen's Propositions.

Yet the busi|ness was so imbroiled, that no resolution could bee given that daie. This difference and contention amongst the chief men of the Citie beeing noised abroad, the people began to mutinie, and divide themselvs into Parties and Factions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Here the Au|tor mislook his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">carms, speaking like a flattering Fri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r.</NOTE> But the Major part inclined to the <HI>worst</HI> Opinion, beeing allured and drawn on with the fair pretence of the <HI>Comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n good</HI>: Those few, who prudently perceived the contrarie, gave the <HI>Emperor</HI> forthwith notice of all these passages in the Citie, and <HI>Antonio Alvarez de Toledo</HI> in par|ticular, who had great intimacie with the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Pa|lencia Mota.</HI> This Advice came to the <HI>Emperor's</HI> hands, just upon his <HI>departure</HI> from <HI>Aragon</HI> to <HI>Valladolid.</HI> But soon after at another meeting in <HI>Toledo,</HI> the Major part voted that they should write to the other Cities of the King|dom, as formerly had been propounded, and that they should send to the <HI>Emperor</HI> two <HI>Regidores,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gidores</HI> and <HI>Iu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ados</HI> are in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he nature of our Alder|men and Common-Council men.</NOTE> and two <HI>Iurados,</HI> or <HI>Iurates</HI> of the Citie, humbly to demand of him as shall bee set down hereafter.

Don Lewis de Palma</HI> hee wrote likewise, reprehending him of his lukewarmeness and small resolution, and gave him order what to do thenceforwards: but hee did not punctually obeie his <HI>Majestie's</HI> Orders, nor observ the manner which was most convenient, for hee was a man of too milde a disposition, which suit's very ill with those who are to govern, especially in cases of that nature.

That hee should not give anie Office or Charge in that Kingdom to anie <HI>stranger,</HI> and that hee should take those away again which hee had so bestow|ed. That hee should not take anie monie out of the King|dom for anie person in the World, becaus they had already contributed so much, that the Kingdom was reduced to great povertie.

<P>I Have declared already the combustions that were in <HI>Valla|dolid,</HI> and the <HI>Emperor's</HI> determination to depart thence, purposing to take his waie by <HI>Tordesillas</HI> to visit the <HI>Queen,</HI> his mother. Which beeing known, and noised through the Citie (moreover that hee would carrie his mother out of the Kingdom with him) the Citizens, and Common Peo|ple were so much troubled at it, that they vented divers as bitter exclamations as a furious passion could dictate to their disturbed mindes. But the chief <HI>Burgesses, Deputies</HI> and other <HI>Officers</HI> met in Consultation at the Monasterie of S^t <HI>Paul,</HI> to take order for investing their <HI>Commissioners</HI> with a ge|neral Power, to grant what the <HI>Emperor</HI> should demand in <HI>Parlament,</HI> to petition his <HI>Majestie</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">om things in their favor, and to kiss his hand before his departure. While they were thus assembled on Mondaie morning, <HI>Don Pedro Lasso</HI> with his Companions, arriveing the same daie at <HI>Valladolid,</HI> and beeing alighted went to visit them. But <HI>Alonso Ortiz,</HI> his fellow <HI>Commissioner</HI> (who resided in Court) said, in regard the <HI>Emperor</HI> was gon to <HI>Church</HI> to praie for his good journie to
<PB N="47" REF="29">
<HI>Tordesillas,</HI> that hee thought it convenient for them to go first to the <HI>Palace,</HI> for perchance his <HI>Majestie</HI> beeing informed of their arrival, would vouchsafe to staie a little, and give them Audience. In this interim som Inhabitants of <HI>Vallado|lid</HI> beeing told of the <HI>Toledo-Commissioner's</HI> coming, went to salute them, desiring that they would indevor to procure som Remedie against those miseries and grievances under which the Kingdom then so much groaned. Hereupon, it was agreed amongst them that the Towns-men should pre|sently put themselvs in a readiness, to oppose and hinder the <HI>Emperor</HI> from going out of the Kingdom, or depart that Ci|tie (in which attempt <HI>Don Pedro Lasso</HI> offered to venture his fortune with them, if they would stand to him,) and that they should seiz upon <HI>Xeures,</HI> and som Flemings of the chief of his <HI>Majestie's Council,</HI> and <HI>Bed-chamber,</HI> binding first those Towns-men with a solemn oath, not to desert him in that enterprize. Beeing pricked with this over-dilligent itch of putting in execution the orders and Commands which their Citie had imposed upon them, before they went to kiss the <HI>Emperor's</HI> hands (which had been the right waie) beeing ac|companied with a gang of <HI>Common People,</HI> and som <HI>Deputies</HI> of the <HI>Wards</HI> (who by this time were come in to them) they went directly to the Monasterie of S^t <HI>Paul</HI> to salute, and communicate their design with the chief of the Citie there assembled; To whom they made a speech, signifying the Causses of their comming, and what they intended to de|sire of his <HI>Majestie</HI> in behalf of their Citie, justifying their de|mands, and coloring them with the most specious pretences that could bee: And indeed, (as at first their meaning was) their affection and zeal to their <HI>Prince</HI> were such, that their thoughts (I believ) differed nothing from their expressi|ons, until things were brought unto such a pass, that there was no hopes of remedie, and that those that had the power, or the wisdom, made a breach through their mise|ries; as did <HI>Don Pedro Lasso</HI> and divers other gentlemen. And at the last they desired, that (as they had written, and offered
<PB N="48" REF="30">
to the Citie of <HI>Toledo</HI>) they would send their <HI>Commissioners</HI> with them, to make a Joint-demand of the same things, which <HI>Salamanca</HI> and other Cities desired:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lladolid's</HI> answer to the Commissio|ners of <HI>Toledo.</HI></NOTE> for a Petition bee|ing countenanced by so manie Cities, would bee much more available. Their speech beeing thus ended, by the general consent of the Assemblie, <HI>Don Hernando Enriquez</HI> (bro|ther to the Lord <HI>Admiral</HI>) returned them this answer; That as yet they were not fully determined what to do, and for that caus they were there assembled, That they would resolv upon that, which should tend most to the <HI>King's</HI> service, and the good of the Kingdom; That they might do what they saw good.

While things were thus in agitation, a rumor be|gan to spread amongst the People, that their Magistrates had granted what the <HI>Emperor</HI> did desire, that hee was going away, and that hee would carrie his <HI>Mother</HI> out of the King|dom with him; and as the <HI>People</HI> are apt to believ all they hear, this report much troubled them, and beeing drunk with passion, they ran madding through the streets; and here and there making stands (after that Countrie fashion) they as|sembled divers circuler consultations, saying, that it would bee fitting to petition the King not to depart; Beeing all up in this confusion without understanding each other's meaning, a certain Rope-maker, by Nation a <HI>Portuguez,</HI> inhabitant of that Citie, seeing that the <HI>King</HI> was readie to depart, and that no bodie would petition him to staie, hee got into the steeple of S^t <HI>Michael</HI> (which is a very ancient Parish in that

The <HI>People</HI> seeing themselvs so numerous, manie of them (as it appeared) would have stop't the <HI>Emperor's</HI> Journie.

And in regard there was no ground for this tumult, it was pre|sently appeased, and the people were ashamed, and sorrie for the irreverence and disrespect they had shewn the <HI>Emperor.</HI> The Officers of Justice of <HI>Valladolid</HI> began to make diligent inquirie, who had rung the Bell, or who gave order for the ringing of it. But the <HI>Portuguez</HI> could not bee found, so others paied for him. Som had their feet cut off; Som were whipped: Som banished and their goods confiscate, Som others had their houses pluck't down. There was whip't amongst others a Goldsmith (a man of good account, a Citizen of the Town) becaus it was proved that hee had received som Letters from the said <HI>Portuguez</HI>: som other Goldsmiths, and som officers of the Town beeing also ta|ken, were very much afraid that they should bee brought to the like publick shame and punishment. But the <HI>Emperor</HI> beeing informed of the good intention of that Citie to|wards him, and that what they had don was not out of malice, or anie premeditated design to do him anie inju|rie, hee sent an Order for releasment of the prisoners, and commanded that there should bee no more said of it.

<P>THe <HI>Emperor</HI> came to <HI>Tordesillas</HI> soundly wet and durtie, and no bodie with him but <HI>Xeures,</HI> the rest could not keep pace with him, and having refreshed himself there one daie, hee continued on his journie to <HI>Villalpando,</HI> where hee had appointed the <HI>Commissioners</HI> of <HI>Toledo</HI> to attend him. They beeing com thither before, met with the <HI>Commissioners</HI> of <HI>Salamanca,</HI> who were <HI>Don Pedro Maldonado,</HI> (who was afterwards beheaded) and <HI>Antonio Fernandez, Regidores</HI> of that Citie; with them were their <HI>Messingers</HI> also, (viz. <HI>Iohn Alvarez Maldonado,</HI> and <HI>Antonio Enriquez</HI>) who were chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fly sent to underfeel, what instructions those of <HI>Toledo</HI> had in all particulars, and had order to conform themselvs in all points to the Messengers of that Citie. At <HI>Villalpando</HI> a Town belong|ing to the Lord High <HI>Constable,</HI> did these <HI>Commissioners</HI> and others exspect his <HI>Majestie's</HI> coming. Upon Sundaie after they had been at Church, they went to the Palace, to the end the <HI>Emperor</HI> should give them audience; while they were at|tending his <HI>Majestie's</HI> pleasure in the Hall, came to them <HI>Don Garzia de Padilla,</HI> and <HI>Mo~ta Bishop</HI> of <HI>Palencia,</HI> who wished them in the Emperor's name (but they thought it was from <HI>Xeures</HI>) to tell them the message they had from their Citie. <HI>Don Pedro Lasso,</HI> and <HI>Don Alonso</HI> answered. That their Citie had commanded them to speak to his <HI>Ma|jestie,</HI> and though they importuned them never so much, they would not declare unto them their business. Thereupon the <HI>Bishop</HI> and <HI>Don Garzia</HI> returned into the <HI>King's</HI> Chamber, but after a little time came out again, and told these <HI>Commis|sioners,</HI> that if they would not give them an account, wherefore they were com, before they kissed his <HI>Majestie's</HI> hand, they should not have audience.

of their Message to them, which done, it was agreed that at two a clock in the afternoon, (if they returned to the Palace) they should have audience. They suspected that this diligence and earnestness of the <HI>Bishop's,</HI> and <HI>Don Garzia'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> to know their business was, becaus the <HI>Emperor</HI> at that time beeing very young, and not much versed in State-affairs, <HI>Xeures</HI> (who was verie discreet and politick) had put them on to urge it before they were admitted, to the end hee might prepare the <HI>Emperor</HI> to give them an answer. The <HI>Commissioners</HI> returned at the hour, and delivered their mes|sage to the <HI>King,</HI> but would not consent that anie others should bee present, onely the <HI>Bishop</HI> and <HI>Don Garzia,</HI> the sub|stance of their discours was as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> have said. They insisted chiefly that his Majestie ought not to go out of the Kingdom, and conluded with this Article, saying, however, if hee did resolv upon his departure, that hee would command such order to bee left for the Government, that the Cities of the Kingdom might have their share therein; And like|wise that hee would bee pleased to demand no Subsidies at all, and other things reasonable enough; as wee sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll see hereafter. Which indeed were so just, that a Dore-keeper nam'd <HI>Duranges</HI> wep't to hear them, considering the great reason the <HI>Castillians</HI> had to complain; But it availed them little at that time; for they were then discountenanced, and not treated according as their's and their Ancestor's good ser|vice had deserved. The <HI>Emperor</HI> told them onely, that hee had heard them, and would give order for their answer. The same hee said to those of <HI>Salamanca,</HI> (who spake to him afterwards) and in effect desired the same things as the <HI>Toledians</HI> had, telling him moreover, that they had order from their Citie to conform themselvs in everie thing with the <HI>Commissioners</HI> of <HI>Toledo.</HI> To whom the <HI>Emperor</HI> sent word by the <HI>Bishop Mota</HI> and <HI>Don Garzia de Padilla,</HI> That in regard his <HI>Council</HI> was at <HI>Venavente</HI> (whither hee was to go within two daies) they should not fail to meet him there, to receiv their answer, which they did accordingly. The
<PB N="56" REF="34">
<HI>Emperor</HI> beeing arrived at <HI>Venavente, Don Pedro Lasso</HI> and his Companion, presented themselvs for their answer. Whereupon the <HI>Emperor</HI> commanded his <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Iu|stice</HI> and of <HI>State</HI> to assemble, who having considered the circumstances and manner of those <HI>Commissioners,</HI> joint|ly gave their opinion, that they deserved rather to bee pu|nished, then to receiv anie good answer or satisfaction to their demands;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Emperor displeased with the <HI>Tole|dians.</HI></NOTE> wherefore the <HI>Emperor</HI> sent for them into his chamber, and with a severely frowning Countenance (as <HI>Don Pedro Lasso</HI> afterwards declared) told them, that hee was not pleased with what they did, and that if hee did not consider from what Parents they were descended, hee would have them punished according to their deserts, for medling with what they had undertaken, and that they should go to the <HI>President</HI> of his <HI>Council,</HI> who would tell them fur|ther what they were to do. They began to excuse themselvs, but the <HI>Emperor</HI> not willing to hear them, retired himself. Then <HI>Don Garzia de Padilla</HI> taking them aside, gave them a no|table schooling, and reproved them sharply for what they had done, telling them that their boldness in insisting so much to the hinderance of a journie, which so deeply concerned not onely the honor and reputation of the Emperor, but al|so the securitie and preservation of his Estate, was beyond the thought of pardon. And that the things which they had done, had been the occasion of disaffecting and disqui|eting the mindes of other <HI>Commissioners,</HI> and of the whole Kingdom, by reason of the precedence and Autoritie, which <HI>Toledo</HI> had amongst all the Cities of <HI>Castilla,</HI> which they should do well to consider, and seriously to reflect upon. After this they went to the <HI>President</HI> of his <HI>Maje|stie's Council</HI> (who was the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> of <HI>Granada</HI>) as the <HI>Emperor</HI> had commanded them. The <HI>President</HI> told them, that what hee had to give them for answer, was that his <HI>Majestie</HI> was going to hold a <HI>Parlament</HI> in the Citie of <HI>Santjago,</HI> where all the <HI>Commissioners</HI> of the Kingdom were to assemble, That <HI>Toledo</HI> should send theirs thither, with a memorial of the

things they desired, which beeing perused and examined, The <HI>Emperor</HI> would give such Orders as should bee most expedient for his service, and the general good of his King|doms and Subjects, moreover hee willed them to desist from medling anie further in those matters, but to return and deal with their Citie, to send their <HI>Commissioners,</HI> as the other Cities of the Kingdom did, and not to affect such innova|tions, as they had begun. Whereunto they made answer, that indeed they were not imploied by the Kingdom, but they desired however that those things might bee granted for the good of the Kingdom, And refusing to follow his advice, but rather thinking it a point of honor to persist in what they had begun, they followed the <HI>Emperor</HI> to <HI>San|tjago.</HI></P>

bee out of <HI>Spain,</HI> and that if there should fall out anie muti|nie, or disorder in Parlament, beeing near the Sea-side, hee could with more facilitie secure his person and goods.

Although som <HI>Com|missioners</HI> would have opposed the granting him anie such Subsidie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Commis|sioners of <HI>Sa|lamanca</HI> refuse the Oath in open Parla|ment.</NOTE> they did not however discover their intention that daie, onely the forenamed of <HI>Salamanca,</HI> who openly refused the solemnitie of the ordinarie Oath, unless his <HI>Maiestie</HI> would first grant them the things which they desired.

<P>THe Kingdom of <HI>Galicia</HI> was much distasted at this <HI>Par|lament,</HI> becaus <HI>they</HI> had no <HI>Commissioner</HI> allowed, and that <HI>Zamora</HI> spake for <HI>them,</HI> notwithstanding <HI>Galicia</HI> was one of the greatest and most ancient Kingdoms of <HI>Spain,</HI> and the source of the greatest Nobilitie.

And in so doing they would oblige them very much: but in case they were refused, they protested, that they would not stand to anie thing, that the <HI>Commissioners</HI> of <HI>Zamora</HI> should denie or grant; and of that they desired witness. Hence grew som hurlie-burlie and tumult in the Parlament. For one <HI>Garci Ruyz de la Mota</HI> (Bishop <HI>Mota's</HI> brother) who was Commissioner for <HI>Burgos,</HI> took upon him to answer, and thwarted the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Villalva,</HI> with language that was much displeasing.

Hee was hardly at the gate of the Cloister, where the <HI>Parlament</HI> was held, when hee met the <HI>Arch-Bi|shop</HI> and the <HI>Earl</HI> coming forth. The <HI>Bishop</HI> perceiving the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Villalva</HI> much incensed, to pacifie his choller, accost|ed him with very smooth and civil Language, expressing much sorrow, that his brother had so much forgotten him|self.

Manie persons of note were wit|nesses to this <HI>Protest,</HI> and it occasioned much scandal in the Court. <HI>Don Pedro Lasso</HI> and his companion slighted his Majestie's commands, which were signified to them by the Secretarie <HI>Covos.</HI> Which beeing told the <HI>Emperor,</HI> hee gave immediate command to banish them that verie daie (beeing Palm Sundaie); and accordingly in the evening his Secreta|rie <HI>Francisco de los Covos,</HI> and <HI>Iohn Ramirez</HI> Secretarie to the <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Iustice,</HI> went to the lodging of those <HI>Toledo-Commis|sioners,</HI> and in the <HI>Emperor's</HI> name signified to each of them severally his <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">jestie's</HI> pleasure, commanding <HI>Don Alonso de Suarez</HI> the next daie (beeing mundaie) to leav the Court, and that within two moneths hee should go serv <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd reside, where that Companie of men laie whereof hee was Cap|tain, where hee should remain until further order from his <HI>Majestie,</HI> under pain of forfeiting his goods, and the said Captain's place. <HI>Don Pedro Lasso</HI> was likewise commanded to absent from Court, the same Mundaie, and within for|tie daies, to go and reside in the Government of the Fort of <HI>Gibraltar</HI> (which was his own inheritance) and not to de|part thence, without the Emperor's leav, under penaltie of forfeiting that Command, and all the rest of his estate what|soever. The <HI>Iurates</HI> were also commanded to leav the Court immediately. And there was order given in their lodgings, that they should not entertein them anie longer. They demanded Copies hereof, but were refused, so they went to <HI>Iohn Ramirez</HI> chamber, and by much importunitie they ob|teined one, but not signed. The <HI>Toledians</HI> beeing extreamly troubled that they were banished the Court with so much rigor, two hours within night, <HI>Don Pedro,</HI> and <HI>Don Alonso</HI> with the <HI>Iurate Ortiz</HI> went to the <HI>Palace.

<P>The next daie, beeing Tuesdaie, in the morning they went away, l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aving <HI>Alonso de Ortiz</HI> onely to sollicite <HI>Xeures,</HI> and to put him in minde of what was agreed betwixt them, and to tell him that <HI>Don Pedro Lasso</HI> and <HI>Don Alonso Suarez</HI> were gon to <HI>Padron</HI> (four leagues from <HI>Santjago</HI>) in obedience to his <HI>Majestie's</HI> Commands. <HI>Alonso de Ortiz</HI> returned to the <HI>Palace,</HI> and meeting <HI>Covos,</HI> hee desired him to help him to the speech of <HI>Xeures. Xeures</HI> beeing com forth, <HI>Ortiz</HI> be|seeched him to perform what hee had promised to those gentlemen. <HI>Xeures</HI> told him, that hee had moved it alrea|die to the <HI>Emperor,</HI> but could not prevail: And that (for ought hee saw) there was no remedie, but that they must obeie the extremitie of his Commands. <HI>Ortiz</HI> replied, that they should have a care what they did therein, and that it would not redound to the <HI>Emperor's</HI> service, not so much becaus those <HI>Commissioners</HI> were of the chief gentrie of the King|dom, as that they were deputed and sent by the Citie of <HI>Toledo,</HI> who must take upon their accompt what trouble or injurie soever they suffered, in regard they had done no|thing beyond, or contrarie to that which their Citie had encharged them, for the good of the Kingdom. <HI>Xeures</HI> answere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, that they had not shewn the respect which they owe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to their <HI>King,</HI> and for that they deserved the punish|men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> which hee had inflicted upon them, and much more. <HI>Ortiz</HI> replied, That since hee had the greatest privacie and
<PB N="65" REF="38">
freedom with his <HI>Majestie,</HI> hee was the more obliged to see to this matter, and to consider with attention, that the whole Kingdom knew that <HI>Toledo</HI> had sent those gentlemen to treat of that which concerned them all, and that seeing them thus banished the Court, they would not think it was for anie disrespect to his <HI>Majestie,</HI> (for if any such thing were they de|served double punishment) but that they were turned out of the <HI>Court,</HI> that they might not solicite the <HI>Kingdom's</HI> good, and thereupon they would bee all scandalized, and such mischiefs would insue, as they would not bee able to remedy when they listed. Whereto <HI>Xeures</HI> very formally thus replied, what lightness is this of <HI>Toledo,</HI> what lightness I say? is the <HI>King</HI> no <HI>King?</HI> why doth no body think of putting <HI>Kings</HI> in and out at their pleasure? <HI>Alonso Ortiz</HI> answered again, that hee wondred, hee should speak so much against <HI>Toledo,</HI> it beeing of such consequence, that it was reputed the best and most considerable Citie of the Kingdom, and had the greatest priveleges and immunities, which the natives did enjoie, for the notable services they had don to the deceased <HI>Kings.</HI> Therefore it could not bee thought, that <HI>Toledo</HI> treated or in|tended anie thing, but what might suit with his <HI>Majestie's</HI> service; Moreover, if hee pleased to look upon what gentlemen had gon into <HI>Flanders,</HI> to serv his <HI>Majestie</HI> against King <HI>Fernando's</HI> will (venturing there, not onely their own lives and fortunes, but their friend's and Kindred's also) hee would finde that the most of them were of <HI>Toledo.</HI> And that those of that Citie, were the cheif means of paying the subsidies to <HI>King Phillip.</HI> And since that Citie produced such gallant men, hee ought not to beleiv that It's intention ever was other, then to do his <HI>Majestie</HI> service. The Secretary <HI>Francisco de los Covos</HI> heard all this discours. These and divers other means the <HI>Toledian Commissioners</HI> used by favor of som great one's about the <HI>Emperor,</HI> to obtain a revocation of their banishment, but nothing would do, for <HI>Xeures</HI> and other <HI>Castilians</HI> of the privie <HI>Council,</HI> opposed it. <HI>Don Alonso Suarez</HI> prudently considering that their business was foyled, and in
<PB N="66" REF="39">
danger of beeing utterly lost, performed what hee was com|manded, and never after put himself into those troubles, nei|ther did hee meddle during all the commotions of <HI>Castilla,</HI> whereby hee lost nothing. <HI>Don Pedro Lasso</HI> did the like (though late) not understanding sooner that hee disserved the <HI>King.</HI> Thus ended the Embassage of <HI>Toledo,</HI> which was so boldly and couragiously performed by these gentlemen.</P>
<P>Before the <HI>Emperor</HI> departed from <HI>Santjago</HI> hee installed Knight of the Order the Earl of <HI>Santisteuan,</HI> the <HI>Marquess</HI> of <HI>Villena's</HI> son.

<P>ON Tuesday in the Holie week before Easter, a Post came from <HI>Toledo</HI> with an express to recall their <HI>Com|missioners</HI>; This Post was dispatch't before there was any notice of their beeing banished from <HI>Court.</HI> Hee brought letters to his <HI>Majestie,</HI> som from the <HI>Assemblie</HI> of the Citie, others from the <HI>Chapter</HI> of their <HI>Cathedral</HI> Church, and from the Monasteries and Fryeries, humbly begging therein a fa|vorable treatment of their <HI>Commissioners,</HI> not as yet knowing what had passed. Moreover they mentioned how <HI>Don An|tonio de Cordoua</HI> (the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Cabra's</HI> brother) their Governor, then beeing at <HI>Toledo,</HI> had produced certain orders from his <HI>Majestie</HI> to <HI>Iohn de Padilla, Hernando de Avalos,</HI> and <HI>Gonsalo Gaytan,</HI> whereby they were commanded to make their perso|nal appearance at <HI>Court,</HI> within a certain time, under penaltie for default. The reason that <HI>Toledo</HI> gave, why these gentle|men did not obey, was, that they were emploied about som affairs concerning the publick good, and that their absence would bee prejudicial to the whole Citie. And therefore they beseeched that his <HI>Majestie</HI> would suspend his command for the present. The gentlemen that stayed at <HI>Padron,</HI> sent
<PB N="67" REF="39">
this dispatch, with the instructions they had from <HI>Toledo,</HI> to <HI>A|lonso Ortiz,</HI> who remained at <HI>Court.</HI> Hee presently went to the <HI>Monasterie</HI> of <HI>San Salvador,</HI> half a league from the Citie (where the <HI>Emperor</HI> had retired himself for the Holie week) and desi|red to enter to deliver the letters to his <HI>Majestie,</HI> but hee found no admittance. Meeting Secretarie <HI>Covos,</HI> hee acquainted him with his business, and told him that hee had letters to deliver to the <HI>Emperor</HI> from <HI>Toledo, Covos</HI> told <HI>Xeures</HI> this, who forthwith sent for <HI>Ortiz,</HI> and bad him give him the letters. But <HI>Ortiz</HI> desired to bee excused, for hee had order to deliver them into the <HI>Emperor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> own hands, and to none els. <HI>Xeures</HI> told him, that the <HI>Emperor</HI> having received the <HI>Sacrament</HI> that morning, was yet at his devotion, and hee could not speak with him. Then they fell to discours again about those gentlemen's banishment, and grew so hot at it, that <HI>Xeures</HI> went away distasted, and <HI>Ortiz</HI> remained with small satisfacti|on. A little after <HI>Covos</HI> came, and told <HI>Ortiz</HI> that <HI>Xeures</HI> cal|led him. <HI>Ortiz</HI> went, and <HI>Xeures</HI> told him, that resolvedly hee could say nothing as touching their banishment, so with|out any more words hee went into another room. <HI>Ortiz</HI> stayed behinde with <HI>Don Garcia de Padilla,</HI> who blaming ex|ceedingly the proceedings of <HI>Toledo,</HI> said, if his counsel might bee taken, the <HI>Emperor</HI> should go thither (it would bee but ten daies work) and inflict som exemplary punishment upon them, that were occasion of those troubles, whereby the rest might bee deterred and quieted. I wish to God hee would, said <HI>Ortiz,</HI> for then his <HI>Majestie</HI> would see the great damages they suffered, and give order for som redress. So they parted, and <HI>Ortiz</HI> went that night to speak with the <HI>Lord Chancellor,</HI> for hee saw there was no possibilitie of delivering his letters to the <HI>Emperor,</HI> nor of speaking with him. The <HI>Chancellor</HI> and <HI>Ortiz</HI> spent a great part of the night, without concluding anie thing to the purpose.</P>
<P>The <HI>Emperor</HI> remained at <HI>Santjago,</HI> untill the thursday in <HI>Easter</HI> week, and then departed for the <HI>Groyn,</HI> where hee made his entrance on Saturday following. Thither repaired also
<PB N="68" REF="40">
the Parlament-men and <HI>Commissioners</HI> to conclude all their businesses. There were produced the testimonies, supplications and Acts, which the <HI>Regidores</HI> and <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Toledo</HI> had made concerning the commanding them to appear at the <HI>Court,</HI> and the Power which the <HI>Citie</HI> sent to <HI>Alonso Ortiz,</HI> charging him to do all the diligences therein expedient, which hee did, and presented himself to the Secretary <HI>Ramirez.</HI> And more|over were delivered the second Orders for their appearance, with greater penalties, which had bin sent to <HI>Toledo</HI> and noti|fied to the gentlemen there.</P>

<P>BY this time <HI>Toledo</HI> had notice of their <HI>Commissioner's</HI> banish|ment, and of the ill success of their affairs in <HI>Court,</HI> which, added to the distaste those <HI>Orders</HI> had bred in them, so exasperated their mindes that their passions grew beyond the bounds of moderation.

<PB N="69" REF="40">
<HI>Donia Maria Pacheco,</HI> who was one of the Kingdome's fire|brands. They possessed the vulgar with a thousand follies, and lies intermingled with som trueths. That the <HI>Emperor,</HI> deserted the Kingdome, that hee left Strangers to govern, that his favorites and Officers had robb'd the Kingdom, leaving the Countrie lean, poor and dismantled of all it's fruits and wealth: These things they caused to bee publish|ed in the Pulpits, And to the end they might the better com|municate their passion, and give everie one a dose of this in|fectious drug, they advised to assemble the people. In that Citie there is a great <HI>Congregation</HI> or <HI>fraternitie</HI> called the <HI>frater|nitie</HI> of <HI>Charitie,</HI> which used every year to make a Solemn <HI>Pro|cession</HI>; upon this occasion there was one ordained to go from <HI>S^t Iusta's</HI> Church to the <HI>Cathedral.</HI> Som (especially <HI>Don Her|nando de Silva, Antonio Alvarez de Toledo,</HI> and others of their o|pinion) knowing to what end this Solemnitie was orday|ned, highlie opposed it, saying that, it was prejudicial to the <HI>King,</HI> and that it was onely a plot and cunning trick of those that were disaffected, and <HI>Don Hernando</HI> required the chief of the Congregation not to make anie such tumultuous meetings (under color of devotion) to disturb the People to the <HI>King's</HI> prejudice and dishonor of justice, for if they did, hee with his friends and servants would hinder it. They valued not these words but rejoiced that <HI>Don Hernando de Silva</HI> did ap|pear in the business, for that would open them the way (as they desired) to augment the distemper of the People, and enkindle their indignation. And it fell out so, for the <HI>People</HI> resenting and condemning highly <HI>Don Hernando's</HI> request, looked on him as an enimie of the Countrie, and as one that did not onely contradict and hinder the good of the common people; But also the most sacred practices of devo|tion. To bee short, they did go in <HI>Procession</HI> and in the <HI>Let|anie</HI> they praied that God would enlighten the understanding and direct the Heart of the <HI>Emperor</HI> well and piously to rule and govern those Kingdoms. <HI>Don Hernando</HI> did not exe|cute his Intention, beeing advertised to the contrarie by the

That they should bee loaded with new taxes, That every head of Cattle should pay such a rate, and every hous so much. And that in this respect whosoever would ingage himself in the defence of the King|dom, with the liberties and freedoms thereof, should purchase an eternall memorie. Hereupon the fire grew so violent that those who discreetly would not ingage in these combustions, for fear of beeing murthered, were enforced either to flie from the Citie, or confine themselvs to their own houses.

Thence hee sent to his Tenants in several places to bring him in provisions, for the sodain and unexspected ne|cessitie of his flying thither did not permit to furnish himself with what was needful. And those of the <HI>Communalty</HI> (as they already styled themselvs) which was the rest of the Citie, following them who took upon them to bee the most wise, set themselvs to fortifie and repair the wals and places of im|portance, fearing the damage they might receive from abroad (for within they feared nothing) and possessed themselvs of the gates and Bridges which were under <HI>Don Iohn's</HI> com|mand.</P>

<P>THe Common People of <HI>Toledo</HI> beeing thus distempered, they determined to possess themselvs of the Fort as well as of the Gates and bridges of the Citie. To this effect a nois was spread amongst them that <HI>Don Iohn de Sylva</HI> was a Traytor to the good of the Communalty, and that it was fit to take the Fort from him and turn him out of <HI>Toledo.</HI> The Multitude gathered together to assault it, and in regard during the Reigns of the Catholick <HI>Kings</HI> there had bin so much peace and so little use of armes, all Forts and places of strength were very ill repaired, and unprovided aswel of arms as victu|als. <HI>Don Iohn</HI> perceiving the People's fury and malice (as you have heard) fortified himself the best hee could, taking into the Fort with him divers gentlemen and others to the number of about four hundred, all resolved to defend themselvs against the People, if assailed by them. The multitude perceiving this, determined first to take the Gates and Bridges of the Citie; so they went forthwith to the Gate of <HI>Visagra,</HI> and to the Port of <HI>Cambron</HI> which they gained without resistance. One of the <HI>Iurates</HI> called <HI>Miguel de Hita</HI> (who the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was joint-Commissioner with <HI>Don Pedro Lasso</HI> and <HI>Don Alonso Suarez</HI>) was commander of the Bridg of <HI>Alcantara,</HI> in whose absence his Lievtenant could not so wel defend the tower of the bridg but that in short time they were masters of it. Thence they went to S^t <HI>Martin's Bridg,</HI> whereof was Commander <HI>Clement de Aguayo</HI> a man of great courage, and hee had provided himself with som friends and servants to help him, they assaulted him desperately, and hee with no less resolution defended himself, until by meer strength they forced an entrance into the first Tower of the Bridg on that side towards the Citie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their grounds were good and had su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ceeded better if they had not bin betrayed by som of the Nobility.</NOTE> for such infinites of Common People and gentry flocked thither (many thinking that rising to bee upon better grounds and
<PB N="78" REF="45">
with a better intention then afterwards it appeared) and the boyes flowed in such multitudes thither, that with brick|bats and stones from an eminent place neer t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ey made them quit the top of the Tower. The assault beeing thus hot from several parts, at last they made breaches and entred with such fury, that taking the Commander they wounded him sorely in two places and threatned to hang him, if hee would not send to command the other tower of the bridg towards the fields to bee surrendred to them; but hee couragiously putting his life to the venture would send no such Order. Hee beeing secured they fell desperately upon the other tower, but they within seeing the success of the former and their Commander taken, had not the courage to stand out, but delivered it immediately to the Citie, Thus they got all the bridges and Gates into their own hands. Thence they mar|ched in very great numbers (All armed) to the Fort, resol|ving to take it by assault if it were not sodainly surrendred to them. Som religious men grieving much at the mischiefs and death of divers persons which must needs ensue so violent an assayling, became mediators betwixt <HI>Don Iohn de Sylva</HI> (who defended the Fort) and the better sort of those that came against it: This treaty continued a good while; at length <HI>Don Iohn</HI> seeing divers of his neer kinsmen against him, his friends and Allies, and considering that hee wanted provisions to make anie long resistance, to avoid the damages his standing out might have occasioned, suffered himself to bee per|swaded to deliver up the Fort, upon condition that one of his own servants should remain as Commander having first taken the Oath of fealty. Thus on Saturday 21 of April <HI>Don Iohn</HI> and his Children with the other gentlemen and friends that were retired thither, came out of the Fort, and went to a village of his four leagues thence, from which place hee wrote again to the <HI>Emperor</HI> informing him how the People had taken the Fort from him, and possessed themselvs of all the Gates and Bridges of the Citie, which news incen|sed his <HI>Majestie</HI> very much, yet hee did not resolve to send any
<PB N="79" REF="45">
Souldiery thither, becaus every one told him that beeing a business of no foundation, it must needs fall again of it self. All this passed before the Governor went out of the Citie, or gave up his Staff. So all the Common People, con|ducted by their Chiefs, went next unto his hous and made him swear that hee should hold his staff, or acknowledg his autoritie and Office as from the <HI>Communalty</HI> of <HI>Toledo.</HI> Hee beeing affrighted with this tumult, condescended to what they would have him do; the People soon after broke out, and did what they listed, seeing him so helpless and so void of reso|lution. The Citie thus wanting both <HI>Governor</HI> and <HI>Don Iohn de Sylva,</HI> Those of the <HI>Communaltie</HI> became freemen and Lords of all, They constituted Deputies, and began to settle a form of government at their own pleasures, Saying they did it in the name of the <HI>King, Queen</HI> and <HI>Communaltie.</HI> In this manner began the great troubles and commotions of <HI>Toledo.</HI></P>

<P>THe <HI>Cardinal</HI> and his Council being arrived at <HI>Vena|vente,</HI> an express from <HI>Don Iohn de Acunia</HI> Governor of <HI>Segovia</HI> came to them purposely to inform them of a notoriously haynous accident befallen in that Citie, which was thus, One of the <HI>Commissioners</HI> or <HI>Burgesses</HI> that was sent thence to the <HI>Parlament</HI> at <HI>Santjago</HI> named <HI>Iohn</HI> or <HI>An|tony de Tordesillas, Regidor</HI> and native of that Citie, gave his consent to the granting the Subsidies his <HI>Majestie</HI> demanded. Hee brought for the Citie the <HI>Pole-money</HI> to bee payed by
<PB N="92" REF="52">
way of excise and a gratuity of one hundred thousand <HI>Maravediz</HI> for reparation of the walls, and for himself hee had procured a very good governement and received an office which the <HI>Mint</HI> or coyning house had given for lost. It is a custome in <HI>Segovia</HI> every Tuesday in whitsonweek that the <HI>Collectors</HI> meet to treat concerning the Revenue of <HI>Corpus Christi</HI> Church. It hapned that being all together one of them inconsiderately sayed, <HI>Gentlemen! you know that Don Iohn de Acunia is Governor of this Citie, and that hee never set foot in it, and yet not satisfied to under value us, hee main|tein's here certain Officers to robb us, rather then to administer Iustice.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tumults in <HI>Segovia.</HI></NOTE> <HI>And I vow to God, if the former stole away our Cloaks, these strip us to the very Skins. Moreover know that the Governor hath put in here a Deputy, more fool then valiant: Hee is not satisfied with the injuries hee doth us by day, but hee leads a dog to catch men in the night. And my opinion is, That if any one hath done what hee ought not to doe, Hee should apprehend him in his house like a Christian, and not hunt him with doggs in the Mountains like a Moore; For a man of any credit is more troubled at his being apprehended in the open street then at his Imprison|ment.</HI> A certain old man, called <HI>Melon,</HI> chanced to bee present at these words, who had for many years executed the office of a <HI>Sergeant</HI> or <HI>Catch-pole</HI> (as they call them); and therefore was hated and abhorred by all the people. This poore man having heard the other out, and every body else holding their peaces, stood up and spake these words in favor of the Justice. <HI>Indeed (Gentlemen!) that which this man hath sayed seemeth to me not well, and mee thinks it is wors that men of such honor and credit (as here are) should give eare to such a man: for hee that will speak in publick of the Ministers of Iustice ought to have some respect and moderation in his tongue; and in an officer of the King's, hee ought not to look onely at his person, but to consider what his staff represent's, As touching the dog hee speak's of, that my Master carrie's with him, I sweare by this cross, that, being a yong man, hee takes him with him more for his pleasure in the day time, then to catch men in
<PB N="93" REF="52">
the night; and if it had been so you doe not, (I hope) take me to be so base, but that I should haue made it known to the people, for I am more beholding to my friends and neighbors then I am to Strangers. If the Officers doe any thing against Law and Iustice, (which hitherto they have not done) like Christians and Gentlemen wee are obli|ged to advise and reprove them in secret, and not defame them publick|ly; and if this which I say now unto you, soundeth not well in your ears, perchance that which will result hereof will please you wors; for ill words inconsiderately spoken somtimes are dearly repented.</HI> This speech was so ill taken by them all, that with shouting and great violence they seized on him, cast a rope about his neck, and with huge nois and exclamations they dragged him out of the Citie, but they bruised him with so many stripes that hee was dead before hee came to the gallowes, yet they hung up his body upon it. As they returned from hanging this unfortunate <HI>Melon,</HI> they met by the way a com|panion of his, called <HI>Roque Portalejo</HI>: To whom one of them said, as they came along, <HI>Portalejo! thy Companion</HI> Melon <HI>re|member's him to thee, there hee hang's upon the gallows, and hee saies hee hopes thou wilt beare him Company there to morrow, and t'were no great matter if wee made thee accept of his invitation, for since thou wast his companion in the fault, it is but reason thou shouldst beare a share of the punishment. Portalejo</HI> replyed, <HI>God preserve the King my Lord and his Iustice, for one day you may repent you for what you haue done and Segovia for permitting it. for the blood of the Innocent, although men doe forget it, is alwaies crying out for vengeance before God.</HI> Hereupon, and because they saw him with a pen and paper, one of them began to say, that hee tooke the names of those that had killed <HI>Melon,</HI> upon which words they all cryed out <HI>kill him, kill him,</HI> So with the same fury in a disorderly rout, as they had done to <HI>Melon,</HI> they layd hands on him, and dragged him to the gallows where they hang'd him by the feet, so the poore man dyed. They spent all that day in execution of those two; The next day being wednesday The Citie sat in counsell; the <HI>Regidor Torde|sillas</HI> went thither to give account of what hee had don in
<PB N="94" REF="53">
<HI>Parlament</HI> although hee was advised to the contrary. The place of meeting was at S^t <HI>Michael's Church.</HI> The People beeing told, that <HI>Tordesillas</HI> had granted the subsidie and that hee was at the Council, a great number of <HI>Carders</HI> ran in a tumultuous manner thither, and climing over the dores and breaking in at the windowes, they violently layed hands upon him and dragged him out of the Church. <HI>Antonio de Tordesillas</HI> intreating them to forbeare, sayed, <HI>Gentlemen! heare me, I come to give you an account. See here the Articles which I bring, bee pacified, and let us goe to some place where you may bee informed of the truth.</HI> But this satisfied not, the multitude of Teazers was so outragious, some cryed, let us carry him to <HI>Santa Olalla</HI>; and poor <HI>Tordesillas</HI> said, <HI>whither you please Gentlemen.</HI> Others cryed, <HI>Kill <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">im, kill him,</HI> Others sayed, <HI>Tordesillas give us those articles.</HI> Hee answered, <HI>Since you will haue it so, there, take them</HI>; then hee drew a paper out of his pocket, wherein was conteined all that hee had done in the <HI>Parlament,</HI> Which they tore in peeces without ever reading it. And with one voice they cryed out, <HI>to prison with him, there wee shall see his treason.</HI> then they set him upon a Mule, beeing clad with a long cassock or gaberdine of crimson velvet. Hee had not gone fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r but some of them crying, <HI>Art thou catched</HI>? layed hands again upon him, and having knocked him off the Mule, they hurried him into the Prison, others cryed out, <HI>A rope, a rope, let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">im not stay in prison, let us have him strait to the gallowes.</HI> And pre|sently with lowd exclamations they cryed out all together, <HI>Let him die, let him die.</HI> And a rope beeing brought they put it about his neck, and plucked him down to the ground, then dragged him along the streets, punching him and giving him great blowes upon the head with the pum|mels of their swords, and although hee cryed out to them with grievous sighs and pitiful groans, saying, <HI>Gentlemen! heare me, why doe you kill mee?</HI> it availed nothing. Hee desired to confess, and they would not suffer him. The <HI>Dean</HI> and <HI>Canon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> with their <HI>Sacerdotal</HI> habits came forth to them, carry|ing the holy <HI>Sacrament.</HI> And (which was most grievous of
<PB N="95" REF="53">
all) <HI>Tordesilla's</HI> own brother, a <HI>Franciscan</HI> Fryer, a very grave man in his habit ready to say mass, and the holy <HI>Sacrament</HI> in his hands, with all the rest of the Fryers of S^t <HI>Francis</HI> order came out, and kneeling all before this crew, they begged of them with tears to spare his life for <HI>Christ Iesu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> sake.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nio de Tordesillas R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gidor</HI> and <HI>Commissioner</HI> of <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">govia</HI> hanged by the People.</NOTE> But in regard all that Rabble was of the common and baser sort of People, they made no reckoning of them, nor bore any respect or reverence to the Church. Then the Fryers de|sired, if there was no remedy but that hee must die, that they would give him leav to make his confession, which they refused. And when they had brought him to the gallows, half choaked already with the rope, they tyed his feet and hung him with his head downwards, betwixt the two others they had hanged the day before. Thus this poor Gentleman ended his life, and doubtless his companion <HI>Iohn Vazquez</HI> had tasted of the same cup, had hee not absented himself, but hee escaped being advertised by this disaster.</P>

About that time was come to <HI>Segovia Don Hernando de Bovadilla Earl</HI> of <HI>Chinchon,</HI> who had great power in the Citie, having the command of the Forts, Gates and Mint-hous; which place was given his ancestors and him by the <HI>King</HI> for former services.

<P>THis message which the Post brought from <HI>Segovia</HI> to the Governors, declaring the crueltie done in that Citie, possessed them with much trouble and care. These risings touched the <HI>Cardinal</HI> to the heart, and hereupon hee entred into consultation with those Gentlemen whom his <HI>Majestie</HI> had appointed to assist him. After this the Gentlemen and <HI>Regidores</HI> of <HI>Segovia</HI> sent another Messinger to make their ex|cuse to the Governor, alledging, <HI>That</HI> they had nothing to doe in the Death of <HI>Tordesillas,</HI> nor the other two men, neither were they able to hinder it in regard of the Mutinie of a great multitude of teazers of Wooll, who made that scan|dalous uproar and outrage, men of strange places, vagabonds, and who were already dispersed and fled from the Citie. That if it could bee proved that anie man of account or worth in the Citie was amongst them, or but anie waie favoured, assisted, or so much as consented to their barbarous proceeding, they would willingly submit themselvs to anie Punishment that could bee inflicted on them. The President of the Council <HI>Don Antonio de Rojas Arch-Bishop of Granada</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="54">
grew so cholerick and furious, that through excess of passion hee gave the Messengers (whom the Gentlemen <HI>Regidores</HI> and Citizens had sent to make their excuses) such reproachful language and high threatnings, that it spoiled all. For return|ing to their Citie much distasted with this answer, They were all scandaliz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d at it, and those that before were very quiet and peaceable began to incline to the Mutiniers. The <HI>Cardinal</HI> beeing arrived at <HI>Valladolid</HI> the 5^t^h of <HI>Iune</HI> 1520, the day before <HI>Corpus Christi</HI> eve, (the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> beeing gon thither two daies before) Hee assembled all the Council and asked their opinions, which were very different concerning this matter. And becaus they are of so much importance to the Historie, I will set down som of the most remarkable which were then taken in writing. The first that spake was <HI>Don Antonio de Rojas President</HI> of the Council, who de|clared himself in these words.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="commentary">
<HEAD>The opinion of <HI>Don Antonio de Rojas</HI> concerning <HI>Segovia.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MY LORDS! wee, who are dedicated to the Divine Sacra|ments, have not the libertie to speak over boldly i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> matters which concern humane rigors and chastisements, becaus our profession is to shed tears for those which transgress against the God <HI>of</HI> Heaven, and not spill the blood of those who offend earthlie Kings. You see, My Lords! if the dignitie of Arch-Bishop invite's me to Clemencie, the office of President (which is conferred upon mee) constrain's me to Iustice. This I say, My Lords, that you m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y not bee scandalized if I declare my self in this my vote. I denie not that our Lord God giveth a beginning to all things with his Providence, but yet manie of them hee persu's and concludeth with his rigor and Iustice. And this hee doth, that the Good may bee incouraged to serv him, and the wicked refrain from displeasing him, According to this saying of the Prophet, <HI>Misericordiam &amp; Judicium cantabo tibi Domine.</HI> To com to the Purpose which now is in agitation, This action of <HI>Segovia,</HI> for my particular I hold it so hainous and scandalous, that I cannot think of any Punishment great enough for it. For where the offence is
<PB N="98" REF="55">
without weight, the Penaltie ought to bee beyond measure. Those of the Citie of Segovia have offended God in so barbarously putting to Death a man, who better deserved to live then They. Which wicked action is of no less consequence, then that it should wreak God's Iudg|ments upon them, for the blood of his Innocencie is no other then the Crier, or Proclaimer of Vengeance. Again, in my sense, they are guiltie of <HI>Crimen laes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Majestatis,</HI> and it is very palpable; for they did not murther <HI>Tordesillas</HI> for any offence hee had done them, but for the service hee did the King in the Parlament. And since for the King hee lost his life, the King is obliged to see him revenged: and in respect his Majestie is gone out of Castilla, to receiv the Imperial Crown in Germanie, It will bee sufficient, if hee return in prosperitie, that hee reward his wife and Children with some gratuity; And wee are to pro|ceed according to Iustice, considering that the offence is as hainous, as if it had been done to his own person. For if I have served his Majestie, beeing here present, in giving him good Counsel, I shall serv him more now, My Lords, in punishing misdeeds in his absence. Moreover, Since the King our Sovereign took shipping at the Groyn, This is the first act of disobedience in Spain. Wherefore I judge their crime the greater. For an offence committed in absence, alwaies argueth the more malice, and where the malice is so great, the Punishment ought to bee corre|spondent. <HI>Item,</HI> it is alleadged by those of Segovia, that the Citie in general is not guiltie of this fact, but only som particular men, Carders, did hang Tordesillas upon the Gallows. I would fain know of them, what was the reason, why they did not punish those fellows, since they were but few; for there is no such testimonie of Innocence, as to exe|cute Iustice upon offenders. In my opinion the Citie of Segovia cannot plead Non-Guiltie in this case, for Five Thousand Citizens (if they had listed) might easily have withstood the furious insolence of Fiftie Teazers, and those Strangers too. But some secretly with their counsels, others publickly using violence, committed this insolent outrage. For if it bee a crime in Wicked men to murther the good, It is no less crime in good men not to resist the Wicked. You have seen, My Lords, the peremptoriness of those of Toledo, The King our Lord beeing at his Parlament in Sant|jago and the Groyn: which was so great and scandalous, that for my part I know not which was more to bee condemned their malic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in so doing, or
<PB N="99" REF="55">
Xeures his negligence in not remedying it. Wherefore I say, that if that which was done, hee being here, hath pas't unpunished, and this, which hath bin committed in his absence, be not remedyed, from henceforwards I give all Castilla for lost and ruined. For this is a General maxime, if Iustice once lose her force, presently start's up insulting Tyrannie. <HI>Item</HI> since his Majestie's departure out of this Kingdom, This is the first scandal wherein it is requisite that the Council make appeare their Counsel and wisdom. And there is nothing that can give a greater evidence thereof, then in governing the People in such sort, that wee may gain the affections of the good, and bee no less feared by the evil. If the death of this <HI>Regidor</HI> bee thus smothered, and the inso|lence of Toledo dissembled, the Carders of Segovia will thinke, and the Cap-makers of Toledo will Proclaime, that wee doe not let these things pass with our good wills, but that wee dare not punish them. And by this means Iustice will bee defamed in that shee cover's Feare, and which is worst of all, will lose the credite of being feared. In summ of all that I have spoken, I say, that my determinate will and opinion is, that an <HI>Alcalde de Corte,</HI> (who is in n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ture of a Iudge of <HI>Oyer</HI> and <HI>Terminer,</HI> here in England) should goe to Segovia, and what hee ought to doe in this (although I know it) my Sacred Orders doe not give me leav to express. I onely say thus much, that the Iudge ought to do wors to them by Iustice, then they did to Tordesillas without Iustice. Let all that I have said in this consultation bee under your most Reverend Lordship's correction: and if these Lords bee of any other opinion, I shall bee content to conform my self to them, for in matters of weight and moment, a man is not to defend his own opinion, but to follow that which is most expedient for the publick good.</P>

<P>IT chanceth often-times amongst the most expert Cap|tains, that being upon the point of giving battle, they dif|fer in the manner and order of their Combate, and if such men take oath of their dissenting opinions, I say that kind of discord proceedeth not from any particular difference betwixt them, but that each one of them thinkes, that what hee sayes is the best and most secure way to gain the Victorie that day. This I say, most Reverend Lord <HI>Cardinal,</HI> in order to my Lord Arch-Bishop and President his Speech, which was very good and beseeming a Prelate that is desirous of the publick good. But if hee and I doe differ in the meanes which is to bee used for the remedying of so great a scandal, wee shall not, I am confident, in our intentions be dissenting.

Hee that is to give his sens in such occurrences, ought not only to see to the remedying of mischiefs, but to bee cir|cumspect and warie lest the fulfilling of his Vote should bee the occasion of a greater Inconvenience.

then that the more cruel and barbarous they have shewd themselvs in that murther, the less pitie wee should shew in chastising them. I would say in this case, that wee are able to punish <HI>Segovia,</HI> or we are not able, and so likewise <HI>Toledo</HI> of their rebellion: and to speak the truth, to my best sens to chastise <HI>Segovia,</HI> or correct <HI>Toledo</HI> is yet too soon. For being, as we are, but newly come to the government, we should grant som privileges and libertie to the People at first, to win their obedience; and afterwards chastise them, that we may bee feared. Put case wee are not powerful enough (as I believ we are not) to quell that high couraged stubborn People, (if my Iudgment fail me not) I hold for most certain, that if <HI>Segovia</HI> lose their respect to us, the like we shall find through all the Cities of <HI>Spain.</HI> Moreover you know, my Lords, that it hath been averred to us, that there was never a Gentleman nor Citizen at the murther of <HI>Tordesillas,</HI> and that those Teazers which had committed the fact, were fled already. The Judge whom wee shall send thither, to seem that hee doth som|thing, must rob the Poor, chastise the Innocent, disquiet the Rich, defame the Noble, and chiefly scandalize the bordering People, so that the untimely punishing of one man's death, may bee an occasion of destroying all. <HI>Item</HI> you know, My Lords, that the King, our Lord, had the ill will of all his Subjects for the ill Government of his Tutors, and certainly those of this Kingdom desire to express their discontents. Me think's, we should rather provide for and hinder the manifestation of the ill intentions of <HI>Castilla,</HI> then to stand so much upon the rigorous chastising of the Carders of <HI>Segovia,</HI> for it is the part of wise men to dissemble and defer the punishment of faults already past, and forthwith apply a remedie to a present evil. <HI>Item, Segovia</HI> cryeth out and desire's, that if Fifty or a Hundred weavers committed that outrage, the whole Citie should not lose its Innocence. And in my Judgment we should bee very injurious and unjust, if we should declare a whole Citie Traytors, when but few are guiltie, and I know the King hath manie faithful servants in
<PB N="102" REF="57">
<HI>Segovia</HI>: therefore wee should commit a great offence there|in. <HI>Besides,</HI> it is as much the Propertie of Clement Princes to pardon many wicked men, for the respect of som few good, as it is the Practise of cruel Tyrants to condemn many good, for a few evil. <HI>Item,</HI> it is sufficiently known that <HI>Toledo</HI> is in Rebellion, and beeing (as it is) so powerful a Citie, wee cannot exercise Justice upon it. Now, if wee doe chastise <HI>Segovia,</HI> wee cannot do it so much dammage, as wee shall do favor to <HI>Toledo</HI> thereby. For all those whom wee take now for enemies, wee make friends to <HI>Toledo.</HI> And by this means there will bee manie favorers of their Tyranie, and but few to assist our Justice. <HI>Item,</HI> it is to be considered that the Citie of <HI>Segovia</HI> and the Town of <HI>Medina del Campo,</HI> by reason of the Cloaths of the one, and the fairs of the other, Those two People used alwaies to bee like Brothers. My end in saying this is, becaus the best Artillerie the King hath in <HI>Castilla</HI> is at <HI>Medina,</HI> and if the business were come to that, They would sooner give it <HI>Segovia</HI> for their defence, then to us to punish them. And by this means <HI>Segovia</HI> will get the Ar|tillerie, and wee shall lose <HI>Medina. Item, Segovia</HI> hath not taken the Fort as yet, nor disobeyed the Justice, nor shut the Gates, nor taken up Armes; And if a Judge go thither to chastise them, perchance wee shall (the Guiltie beeing fled away for fear of punishment) give occasion of fear to those that are Innocent, and they put themselvs into a defensive posture thereupon. And this will bee the way to make those whom wee have as yet for subjects, declare themselvs our enemies, My Lords, I will not extend my self any further in my dis|cours, but only that for the reasons which I have alleged, and for others which I could produce, I doe not deny but <HI>Segovia</HI> ought to bee chastised: But my vote is, that for the present, it should bee dissembled. For prolonging a punish|ment never did harm: and an over-hastie execution of Justice never did good.</P>

At length, hearing that they were retired into that Monasterie, they sent to the Friers to turn them out, if not, they would go and set fire to the hous.

de la Rixa,</HI> who with this rout went to seek <HI>Don Diego de Oso|rio</HI> Lord of <HI>Abarca,</HI> a gentleman of great qualitie, inhabitant of the Citie of <HI>Burgos,</HI> but met him not until the Evening; having found him, they brought him by violence into the market-place with much nois and tumult, saying, Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t hee must bee their Chief, and must govern them: they put a white staff of Justice into his hand, and upon his left arm a Target. <HI>Don Diego</HI> bid them be quiet, and tell him where|fore they brought him out of his hous, and put him in that equipage. They answered, That as a gentleman hee should protect them and free them from that slaverie wherein they lived. They would not hear him speak, but threatned him, if hee would not do as they required him: they continued pressing of him thus till night, and staied for his resolution till next daie. <HI>Don Diego</HI> at that time was Governor of <HI>Cordo|va,</HI> and came thither onely to see the Ladie <HI>Isabel de Rojas</HI> his wife and his children, so hee presently got out of their hands, and that same night took his waie towards <HI>Cordova,</HI> leaving his hous to the charge &amp; care of <HI>Don Pedro de Cartagena</HI> Lord of <HI>Olmillos</HI> (who had married the Ladie <HI>Marie de Rojas</HI> his daugh|ter) to the Dean of <HI>Burgos Don Pedro Xuarez de Velasco,</HI> and <HI>Fran|cisco Sarmiento,</HI> who was his kinsman.

This resolution of their's daunted the Assailers, so that none offered to stir, but went all quietly away. <HI>Don Pedro Xuarez de Velasco</HI> went along with them, for <HI>Bernal de la Rixa</HI> the Cutler, their Captain, bore him much respect, becaus hee had received a son of his nam'd <HI>Valoradico,</HI> to be a singing-boie

An humor took them to burn down the <HI>Carthu|sian's</HI> wood, and as they were going with this resolution, <HI>Don Pedro Xuarez</HI> met them by the waie, and told them, that it would bee very well done of them, indeed, to set that wood on fire, but the world would bee so rosted with the heat, that it were better to keep the wood till winter, and not to burn it in the field to no purpose; so hee turned them back again from S^t <HI>Paul's Bridg.</HI> They were so audacious as to assault the Lord <HI>Constable</HI>'s hous, hee beeing Chief of that Citie, and ha|ving heard that the Dutchess <HI>Donia Maria de Tobar</HI> Marquess of <HI>Berlanga,</HI> a Ladie of great worth, had threatned them, they came one daie in great number thither, and having enviro|ned the hous, they shot off a piece of Ordnance, which beat down a corner of the Tower, so they entred into the hous, &amp; the Dutchess was forc'd to hide her self in som secret by-place. They went also to <HI>Garci Ruiz de la Mota</HI> his hous, (who had been Commissioner in that last Parlament, brother to <HI>Maestro Mota</HI> Bishop of <HI>Badajos</HI> and <HI>Palencia</HI>) with intent to kill him, but not finding him (for hee was fled) they burned and pluck't down his hous, where were consumed great num|ber of Writings, as Deeds and Charters, and manie other papers concerning the King and Kingdom, which hee had in keeping. That which they burned in <HI>Mota's</HI> hous, was va|lued above three Millions, when they carried it to the place where they made the Bonfire, into which they cast all the moveables they could finde in the hous; as pure linnen, rich tapistrie-hangings, cloaths, houshold-stuff, and manie chests or trunks full, all which they burned, without making be|nefit of anie thing (which was a wonder, considering the condition of such mean people).

<P>THe distempers of <HI>Madrid</HI> (for as I have said, that Citie rose also) were no less then those of the other Com|monalties of <HI>Castillia. Francisco de Vargas</HI> a man of honor and approved fidelitie, mainteined the Fort against the People, notwithstanding all the diligences they could make to turn him out, and possess themselvs of it. They required him of|tentimes with manie threats, that if he would not deliver it up to them, they would hang as manie as they could light upon, of those that were within. <HI>Francisco de Vargas</HI> perceiving the streight hee was in for want of men, got secretly out one night and went to <HI>Alcala</HI> (six smal Leagues from thence) for som assistance. Hee procured about fortie men, whom (that they might get into the Fort without beeing discovered) hee ordered to enter by two and two on hors-back. This could not bee carried so close, but the Citie had som intelligence thereof. Whereupon the People beeing all Alarmed, in great hast and furie, som on Hors-back som on foot, ran out to in|tercept him, taking som Gentlemen to bee their Captains. Beeing in the field they ranked themselvs in better order, and when the Captain of the Fort was readie to enter with his men, they fell upon him, who beeing but a smal number, were forced to seek their safetie by flight; <HI>Francisco de Vargas</HI> beeing advantagiously mounted, with som others that were able to follow him, returned to <HI>Alcala.</HI> The people after that, grew more careful, and kept Spies out and Guards in all the Avenues of the Citie, then they fell upon the Fort with great furie, encompassing it round, but they durst not ap|proach too near, for those that were within defended them|selvs very stoutly, welcoming them with manie musket-bul|lets

The Fort beeing in this streight, <HI>Diego de Vera</HI> with his men approched, &amp; faced <HI>Madrid.</HI> Hee had force enough to have relieved the Fort with men and provisions, and ill treated the Commoners of <HI>Madrid.</HI> But hee was wearied with a tedious march, and discontented that hee had not received of a long time paie, neither for him|self, nor his Souldiers; besides, at the same time Letters were brought him from the Citie of <HI>Avila</HI> (where hee was bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and had his estate and familie) wishing him to let those of <HI>Madrid</HI> alone, and no waie to molest them, for if hee did, they would pluck down his hous, and set fire on all his goods. Out of this fear <HI>Diego de Vera,</HI> dissembling his design, would not enter into <HI>Madrid,</HI> nor do anie thing to help the one partie, or prejudice the other. <HI>Madrid</HI> finding themselvs but weak in men, and not very well provided with Arms, sent to <HI>Toledo</HI> for succor, who forthwith furnished them with five hundred men and thirtie Lances, under the Com|mand of <HI>Goncalo Gaytan.</HI> Having received this supplie, they resolved to undermine the Fort in four places, w^c^h they within perceiving, shot still more and more fiercely, and killed som of their workmen, which made them leav mining by daie, &amp; labor onely in the night, with Blindes and Engines, made like Carts, which they might go safely under, and for their better securitie, at the front of all, they placed the Children and nea|rest of kin to those that were within the Fort, to make them refrain from shooting, for fear of killing them; yet for all this, <HI>Francisco de Vargas</HI> his wife (who was within) was so ready to assist, and so wittily cunning to endeer and encou|rage her men to fight, (lest her husband should bear anie blame) that they still held out, and defended themselvs cou|ragiously. The Towns-men sent to require them to surrender the Fort, if not, they threatned that none should go either in or out, but should bee either killed or taken; whereunto shee made Answer, that they troubled themselvs in vain, and shee would have them know, <HI>That</HI> although her husband was absent, neither shee, nor anie of the rest with her, were of

such low and unworthie spirits, as, out of fear of their threat|nings, to do an act so prejudicial to his Majestie's service, <HI>That</HI> they were all resolved rather to die in their own defence, then commit so High a Treason; for where shee was, her Hus|band's honor should not suffer in the least. The People hear|ing this, broke into a furious rage, crying out with loud voi|ces, Let them die though wee all perish. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o all beeing armed, they environed the Fort on all sides, and planted their Artille|rie in order against it. Those within stood stoutly in their de|fence, discharging all the great Guns they had, which were manie and good, and put in a readiness their Muskets and other Arms, but they wanted men to plie their smal shot, The Artillerie began to plaie on both sides. The Fort battered down all the neighboring houses, and the Gunners shewed much skill both within and without, yet did not so much mischief on either side, as they might have done. At last came som Religious men to mediate a peaceable agreement. And as it was half concluded, a Gentleman stept in and crossed all, saying with a loud voice, <HI>O you traitors, rogues, Iews of</HI> Ma|drid! <HI>What have yee done? What Agreement is this you will make, so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> prejudicial to the King and your Citie? you do it but out of cowardise.</HI> This and manie things more hee said, insomuch that the peo|ple mutinied, and grew rather more distempered then before; som favored him, others were enraged to kill him, so there grew a great tumult, and a bloodie confusion, dealing blows and thrusts of Swords and Lances on all sides. But my Gen|tleman was taken at last by the Common people, whereof som would have killed him presently, others more discreet, thought fitter to keep him prisoner, until they knew what mo|ved him to cast that seed of dissention amongst them, to hin|der the Agreement which was then concluding. The next daie, the people returned to assault the Fort, and their Gunner killed the Gunner of the Fort, and left them none to manage the Artillerie. Then they cut off their water, and their pro|vision of Victuals growing short, at last they were enforced to surrender the Fort to the Commander of those of the Com|monaltie.

Which at first they did obey: and the Judg began to make his privie search and examination, whereby hee found som guiltie, which hee gave order to apprehend. This pleased not the People, who began to think of turning him out of the Citie. Hee sentenced a Shoomaker to bee whipp'd, who beeing brought through the streets,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The people re|scue the offen|dor, and mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i|nie against <HI>Le|guiz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ma.</HI></NOTE> the Beadles still whipping him, the people mutinied, and manie beeing armed, they rescued the prisoner with great nois and hubbub; which done, they went into a hous to consult what they were to do. The Judg perceiving that presently betook him to his heels, and fled into the Marquess of <HI>Velez</HI> his hous, who then was in the Citie. The Marquess hearing that the Judg was gone to his hous, hee would not staie with him, but presently took hors and rode out of the Town as fast as hee could to <HI>Mula,</HI> a Citie ten leagues from <HI>Murcia.</HI> The Judg made all haste possible after the Marquess, and overtook him in the field a good waie from <HI>Murcia,</HI> where hee shewed him his Orders, charging him in the King's name, under pain of Death and Confisca|tion of all his Estate, to go back again with him into the Ci|tie, and to aid and assist him to do Justice. The Marquess an|swered him very angerly, (for hee had desired him before to bee very careful how hee proceeded, to consider the times, and not to be too rigorous, but he would not follow his counsel) saying,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Marquess of <HI>Velez</HI>'s an|swer to <HI>Legui|zama.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Iudg!

By this time the Commonaltie was monstrousty di|stempered, and a multitude not onely of the Towns-people,

And the Spaniards, although they had som reason to com|plain, could not bee excused for rising up in Arms. <HI>Mon|sieur de Xeures</HI> grew much discontented and ashamed upon the report of this breaking out of <HI>Spain,</HI> partly becaus hee knew what opinion went of him in the Court, but chiefly becaus hee thought (as justly hee might) the Emperor would derive the fault upon him: who, whil'st hee was in <HI>Spain,</HI> commanded with so absolute a power, that it was commonly said, The Emperor <HI>Don Carlos</HI> is King by right, and <HI>Monsieur de Xeures</HI> in effect. The Emperor beeing thus disquieted, called a Council, and desiring to have their advices, hee propounded, That they would consider what means was to bee vsed, that Hee might go into <HI>Germanie,</HI> and receiv that Crown which Hee so much desired, and provide som reme|die to settle the disturbances of <HI>Spain,</HI> which was of no less importance to him, for his Coronation could bee no longer suspended, and the remedying of <HI>Spain</HI> ought not to bee dif|ferred. Hee had of his Council in this occurrence, <HI>Germanes, Flemings, Italians, Aragoneses</HI> and <HI>Castillans</HI>; and their opinions were as different as their Nations. For the <HI>Germanes</HI> urged, that it was repuisite his Majestie should continue his journie into <HI>Germanie.</HI> The <HI>Italians</HI> said, it was necessarie that hee should make<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a progress into <HI>Italie.</HI> The <HI>Flemings</HI> were very importu|nate for him to staie in their Countrie. The <HI>Aragoneses</HI> pleaded, that <HI>Valencia</HI> was also risen up in Arms.

But at last the resolution of the business was given by few&punc; as great Princes use to do in like occurrences. The result of this Consultation was, <HI>That</HI> the Emperor should continue his journie into <HI>Germanie,</HI> and having received the Imperial Crown, there to remain until hee had fully settled the affairs of that Countrie, not being everie daie to return thither. It was likewise resolved, <HI>That</HI> his Majestie should send amiable and gracious Letters to all the Cities and Towns of <HI>Castilla,</HI> requi|ring
<PB N="154" REF="83">
som of them to return unto themselvs and his service, and expressing his thankfulness to others for their good in|tentions towards him; <HI>That</HI> hee should desire and encharge the Nobles and Gentrie to favor and assist those of his Roial Council; promising to all upon the faith of his Roial word, that with all possible expedition hee would return into <HI>Castil|la,</HI> (for the thought of the Emperor's never returning into <HI>Spain,</HI> bred in the Common people the boldness to commit such outrages and exorbitances). Moreover it was determi|ned, <HI>That</HI> the Emperor should write unto the President and Council, condoling their troubles and persecution, comman|ding them withall, that in one place or other, six of them should alwaies bee about the Cardinal and hold Council: To the end they might serv as a Refuge for the good people to appeal unto, and bee a terror to the evil: for if the Council omitted the doing of Justice, the Roial Autoritie must needs fall. And also, <HI>That</HI> the Emperor should appoint two other Governors to bee joined in Commission with the Cardinal, and those to bee men of noble extractions, well experienced, and advanced in years, of generous dispositions, powerful in estates, but chiefly Natives of that Kingdom. This advice see|med very sound and pertinent to the Emperor, whereupon hee gave order it should bee put in execution accordingly, and those whom they Voted to bee joined in Commission with the Cardinal were, <HI>Don Fadrique Enriquez</HI> Lord High Admi|ral of <HI>Castilla,</HI> and <HI>Don Inigo de Velasco</HI> Lord High Constable, who were both antient Gentlemen of great generositie and gallantrie. Which Election gave no small satisfaction to the <HI>Castillan</HI> partie, for they had shewen themselvs in their com|mands not onely wise but valiant, and were alwaies fortunate in their undertakings. These Noblemen governed with such valour and prudence, that the Emperor in his Letters to the Lord High Constable, give's him thanks for his services, ac|knowledging that by his means hee was King of <HI>Castilla.</HI> And indeed the Emperor said but what was true. Besides all this, his Majestie sent an especial Command, <HI>That</HI> the subsidie
<PB N="155" REF="83">
which was granted him at the <HI>Groyn,</HI> should not bee exacted from those Cities which continued in their obedience to him, nor from those which were willing to submit and bee redu|ced, for it was his will and pleasure graciously to forgive it them. This grace hee did likewise to the whole Kingdom, <HI>That</HI> the Roial Revenue should bee allowed for the Taxes, as during the Reigns of other Catholick Kings, his Ancestors. Hee resolved also to abrogate the sale, farming and enhaunce|ment of all Taxes and Impositions, (which indeed were ve|ry great): and besides hee sent to offer and certifie, <HI>That</HI> no Office in that Kingdom should bee conferred upon anie whomso&euml;ver, unless hee were a Native; which if hee had granted when hee was desired, these Commotions had never happened. Of all this were ingrossed his Majestie's Patents and Commissions of sufficient power. Yet notwithstanding these three things were the principal grievances and most im|portant reasons that <HI>Toledo</HI> and the other Cities alleged for ex|cuse of their tumultuous risings: The granting all these de|mands was not available enough to quiet their Commotions and reduce them to obedience;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Here the Au|tor flatter's&punc;</NOTE> for the Contrivers and Ring-leaders, who had seduced the people into those mischievous practices, finding profit in fishing in that troubled water, hindered all they could that these graces of his Majestie might not com unto the people's knowledg, and when they were known, they gave out that they were vain promises, and onely fained or framed by the Council, becaus they were not able to do any thing els untill they had divided the people, and then that they would fall upon them.</P>

And in regard one of the most notorious Actors in these tragi|call disorders, was <HI>Don Antonio de Acunna,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Zamora,</HI> who is famous to this very daie, for the strangeness of his dis|position, and manner of the death hee suffred, which was not suitable to the dignitie of a <HI>Prelate,</HI> (but very answerable to his Actions, since it was done with very great justification of the <HI>Emperor,</HI> and by the Autoritie of <HI>Pope Clement</HI> the 7^t^h, as appear's upon Record in the Arches of <HI>Simancas,</HI> which I have seen) you shall briefly hear who this Bishop was, and what his conditions. During the time of <HI>Don Iohn</HI> the second his raign in <HI>Castilla,</HI> lived in that Kingdom <HI>Don Luis Osorio de Acunia,</HI> a Gentleman of eminent note and account, father to <HI>Don Diego Osorio</HI> and this <HI>Don Antonio de Acunia,</HI> to whom his father dying left the Arch-Deakonship of <HI>Valpuesta,</HI> be|sides other meanes, In these times hee beeing in service to their Catholick <HI>Majestie's</HI> was sent by them Embassador into <HI>France,</HI> after which the Bishoprick of <HI>Zamora</HI> was conferred upon him. The King was not very well pleased with him, becaus hee was of a turbulent Spirit, a lover of broils, impatient, adventurously bold, and one that did take more upon him, then his profession and degree required. Hee was naturally inclined to Arms, his ambition was to make himself Lord and Master of <HI>Zamora,</HI> where the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Alva de Lista</HI>
<PB N="158" REF="85">
then lived, son in law to the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Alva,</HI> a stout gallant Gentleman and a great lover of honor. The Bishop and the Earl meeting about certain affairs betwixt them they grew to such odds, that very good Mediators were not able to pacifie them. <HI>Zamora</HI> beeing in Rebellion, and paying no obedience but to the <HI>Junta</HI> or <HI>Assemblie,</HI> the Bishop on one side and the Earl on the other, used all means possible to draw the people to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ir factions. The Earl was better beloved, and bore the greater sway in the Citie, so that the Bishop was forced to leav it: It made him half madd to lose his hous, and so desperate seeing his Enemie prevail so far against him, That hee presently went to <HI>Tordesillas</HI> (where the Commissioners of the <HI>Iunta</HI> were then assembled) with whom hee joyned in confederacie, desiring them to assist him and furnish him with forces to beat the Earl of <HI>Alva</HI> out of <HI>Zamora.</HI> They all received him with great respect and contentment, thinking it an honor to their caus, to have so eminent a <HI>Prelate</HI> amongst them, they gave him men and Artillerie, wherewith hee marched back towards <HI>Zamora.</HI> The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arl beeing informed of the manner of his enemie's advance, thought not fit to stay for him, but quitting the Fort, went and associated himself with the <HI>Cavaliers</HI> of the Loyal Partie, as you shall hear. Thence forwards the Bishop stuck close to the <HI>Iunta,</HI> and the Farl as eagerly followed the King's counsel, each of them so much favoring their Partie, that there were not anie two more remarkable then they. The Bishop was threescore years of age, but as vigorous and lively as if hee had been but five and and twentie. I was acquainted with one that knew him and received orders from him, who told me that hee was excellent at handling his arms. That hee had more then foure hundred Priests under his command all well armed and valiant men, and that hee still charged at the head of them himself, Saying, <HI>Here my Priests.</HI> The rest hereafter.</P>

<P>I Have told you in what manner <HI>Segovia</HI> was fortified, the resolution of the Inhabitants, the relief which they receiv|ed from manie places, notwithstanding <HI>Ronquillo's</HI> endeavors to hinder it; how <HI>Toledo</HI> incouraged them with promises both of men and monie, <HI>Madrid, Guadalaxara,</HI> and <HI>Salamanca</HI> did the like, making their case their own. <HI>Medina del Campo</HI> secured them their trading, offering to bear what loss so&euml;ver they should sustein either of persons or goods.

That hee would command <HI>Ronquillo</HI> to rais his Siege, and that hee should not molest, nor use such crueltie against <HI>Segovia.</HI> The Cardinal and those of the Council did not weigh much this Petition of <HI>Avila,</HI> which so incensed that Citie, that thereupon they sent them word

peremptorily, that since they would not rectifie those disor|ders, they were resolved to seek their own remedie.

It happened that two young men coming out of <HI>Segovia,</HI> fell into the hands of <HI>Ronquillo's</HI> Guards, who asking them whence they were, and whither they went?

At first the Guards were in the minde to let them go, becaus they seemed to bee but poor fellows, yet afterwards they laid hands on them and brought them before <HI>Ronquillo</HI>; who asking them who they were, whither they went, and whence they came? They said, they were Carders, who seeing <HI>Segovia</HI> streightned, and trading dead, they were upon their return to their ovvn houses.

Al|though the Mightie and Illustrious <HI>Don Carlos,</HI> her son, had governed <HI>Spain,</HI> yet by reason of his sudden departure, the Kingdom was risen in such Commotions and Disordrous manner, that all <HI>Spain</HI> was ready to bee destroied, and that now hee was com with a certain Armie of <HI>Toledians</HI> to serv her Highness, whom hee desired to see, and know what Com|mands shee had to laie upon him, for hee was ready to spend his life in her service. The Queen was much astonished to hear such things, and said, shee never knew any thing of it be|fore: For shee had been sixteen years shut up within a cham|ber, under the Guard of the Marquess of <HI>Denia,</HI> and wondred to hear anie such stories, but if shee had known of her Fa|ther's death, shee would have gon abroad and set som reme|die to those mischiefs. So forgetful and void of Judgment was the Queen. Then shee said to <HI>Iohn de Padilla,</HI> Go you now, I command you, take the charge, and execute the office of Captain General in the Kingdom, and give you order for all things as need shall require, until I provide otherwise. This said, shee retired into her chamber; and <HI>Iohn de Padilla</HI> return|ed to his Quarters, well attended and very jocund for the fa|vour

the Queen had done him, in giving him that Commissi|on. Manie times after this, <HI>Iohn de Padilla</HI> had conference with the Queen, and she seemed to give Audience to him and others of the <HI>Iunta,</HI> very willingly. They told her once, that the King her son, had done great damage to the Kingdom, whereunto shee answered, That her son was not greatly in fault, for hee was but a youth, but the Kingdom rather ought to bee con|demned for suffering it. Then shee commanded, that the As|semblie of the Kingdom should bee kept there, that shee would autorize it. Hereupon an Order was forthwith issued out, That Proclamation should bee made in <HI>Medina</HI> and other places, for all the Commissioners that had assisted in Parlament at the <HI>Groyn</HI> to make their appearance and render an account at <HI>Tor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">esillas</HI> under pain of death.</P>

<P>THe <HI>Iunta</HI> was yet held at <HI>Avila,</HI> whither was sent an Or|der from the Queen, commanding them to remove to <HI>Tordesillas,</HI> w^c^h they presently obeied, for it was their only waie so to do; The Queen understanding nothing what belonged to businesses. The Antagonists of the <HI>Junta</HI> gave out, That those Dispatches which were produced and publshed in the Queen's name were fals, and the testimonies likewise made by counterfeiting hands. The <HI>Junta</HI> took a resolution to turn the Marquess of <HI>Denia</HI> out of the Queen's service, for the ill opinion hee (beeing a loial subject) conceived of the Com|moners, alleging, that shee was not well pleased with him. And becaus they would bee informed how the Marquess did serv the Queen, they sent to <HI>Maestro Fray Pablo</HI> a Dominican Frier, a grand Commoner, Commissioner of <HI>Leon,</HI> and to the <HI>Commendador Almaraz,</HI> Commissioner of <HI>Salamanca,</HI> and <HI>El Ba|chiller de Guadalaxara</HI>:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Here the Au|tor jeer's his own Coat.</NOTE> And from these men's relation (which was never the holier for the Frier's having any part in it) re|sulted

a determination to turn the Marquess and his Ladie from the Queen. Whereupon they were not onely cast out of their hous, but driven out of <HI>Tordesillas,</HI> with such strictness and precipitation, that they had not one hour's time to take a|way their goods and housholdstuff, and although they made their Requests to the contrarie, they were no whit the more regarded. In their places were presently put <HI>Donia Catalina de Figueroa,</HI> wife to <HI>Quintanilla,</HI> and som other women of the Town.

Soon after, <HI>Salamanca, Avila, Madrid,</HI> besides other places, sent manie Companies of Foot and Hors, paid at the charge of the said Cities, with their respective Captains, who had Orders to bee at the King and Queen, his Mother's ser|vice, and in favor of the <HI>Junta.</HI> There was already so great a confluence of Gentlemen and Captai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, that <HI>Tordesillas</HI> was not able to contein them, although the Common Souldiers were quartered in the adjacent Villages. The Citie of <HI>Vallad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|lid</HI> sent a thousand chois men well Armed, under the Com|mand of <HI>Don Diego de Quiniones,</HI> a valiant and well-born Gen|tleman. The Commissioners, Gentlemen, Captains with ma|ny grave and learned Friers, beeing assembled in the <HI>Junta,</HI> there was a motion made, that they should send to <HI>Valladolid,</HI> to seiz upon the President and the rest of the King's Council, and to have them brought to <HI>Tordesillas,</HI> or at least, to take such or|der, that the Citie of <HI>Valladolid</HI> should not back them or con|ceal them, but should give waie that the <HI>Junta</HI> might appre|hend and bring them away. To this (the report is) there wanted no Votes, neither were the Friers backwards in giving theirs, alleging, that the securing of those men was very ne|cessary for the good of the Kingdom. To this effect was dis|patched a Dominican Frier (who was a man of honor and great leaning) with Letters of Credence to the Commonaltie of <HI>Valladolid,</HI> and to the <HI>Infante</HI> of <HI>Granada,</HI> their chief Cap|tain
<PB N="167" REF="89">
The Frier having delived his Letter and Message to the <HI>Infant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> hee thus answered, Father, as far as it concern's mee (as beeing Captain of <HI>Valladolid</HI>) I do obeie the Orders here sent from the <HI>Junta,</HI> but it is convenient the whole Commo|naltie should bee assembled, that you may deliver your Mes|sage to them all together, and receiv their answer. Hereupon the Deputies of the Wards, Jurates, Common Council-men and other Officers, were all ordered to warn the Inhabitants of their respe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tive quarters and parishes, to make their appear|ance the next morning by nine of the clock at the Church of <HI>Santa Maria la Mayor,</HI> which was done accordingly. The <HI>In|fante</HI> of <HI>Granada, Don Pedro Giron</HI> and other Gentlemen, beeing there assembled, with the rest of the Commonaltie, at the hour and place appointed, the Frier went up into the Pulpit, and with smooth fair language, hee told them the substance of his Message, saying, That he came thither from the Lords of the <HI>Junta</HI> at <HI>Tordesillas</HI> (who were the greater part of the Kingdom, and were there assembled for the remedying of the distractions and mischiefs which abounded in that King|dom, as appeared by the Power &amp; Letters of Credence) which hee had already shewed to that very noble Commonaltie of <HI>Valladolid,</HI> and the <HI>Infante</HI> their Captain. Yet becaus it was thought fit that a business of such weight (as that wherewith hee was intrusted to impart to them) should rather bee mani|fested to them all in that place, then communicated to any members in particular, and in regard they were then all assem|bled, hee again notified those Letters unto them, giving them to understand that the Lords of the <HI>Junta,</HI> moved with a ve|ry holie zeal, and desire of procuring the Kindom's good and his Majestie's service, had found it convenient (to the end the Intent of the <HI>Junta</HI> might the better take effect) that there should bee no Council Roial at all, but that the President and the rest should bee sent prisoners to <HI>Tordesillas,</HI> and to shew that their Intentions were holie, and tending onely to the ser|vice of God, and the King, in the name of the Lords Com|missioners of the <HI>Junta,</HI> hee did assure the lives of the Council,
<PB N="168" REF="90">
but not their goods and estates. For they must know, that whoso&euml;ver of that Council had offended, his estate was liable to confiscation, according to the qualitie of his delict, and that the monie which should accrue, should repair in part the dam|mages which they had occasioned. Hereupon the Frier ex|tended himself into manie Rhetorical expressions, to cog the peopl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> into a Consent, urging, that if they did otherwise, it might bee the occasion of bringing the whole Kingdom to destruction: for if there was both a <HI>Junta</HI> and <HI>Council,</HI> the <HI>Jun|ta</HI> governing contrarie to the sens of the <HI>Council,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nta</HI> send'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to <HI>Val|ladol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d</HI> to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s|sol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">g'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Counc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">.</NOTE> and the <HI>Coun|cil</HI> abrogating what should bee enacted by the <HI>Junta,</HI> what could bee exspected but confusion and utter ruine? Hereunto hee desired their speedie answer, becaus hee was to return to <HI>Tordesillas.</HI> They forthwith replied, That it was a business of no small moment, and required great consultation, yet if hee would stay till night, hee should have their answer. They divided themselvs into several Assemblies to consult hereupon, and they were generally of opinion, that it was a difficult and strange attempt for them to dissolv a <HI>Council</HI> of so great Auto|ritie, beeing constituted by their King, especially that Citie having received, in particular, so manie Immunities and other favors from them, and they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eeing so good friends, that the Council had,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dolid's</HI> Answer.</NOTE> in a manner, entrusted them with their per|sons, it were an act of high inhumanitie and baseness to laie violent hands upon them. On the other side they thought, that they were bound in conscience not to leav undone the Commands of the <HI>Junta,</HI> in regard their Commissioners were there, they had acknowledged their power, and had sworn to obey whatso&euml;ver should there bee ordered or enacted. In the end, they agreed to give the Frier this answer, That if the <HI>Junta</HI> did desire to apprehend those of the <HI>Council,</HI> they should send their own Captains and souldiers to do it, for <HI>Valladolid</HI> would have no hand in either helping or hindering them in that design, neither would they favor the one side, or oppose the other.

<PB N="169" REF="90">
with this Answer, The Frier reckoned up those of the Coun|cil whom the <HI>Iunta</HI> demanded, which done, it was agreed, that everie Deputie of a Ward should take four or five of the said names in writing, and go with a Notarie publick to their respectiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> houses, or lodgings, requiring them to meet the next daie in the cardinal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s hous, where hee should tell them what further they were to do.

And having ended his discours, hee produced and read aloud to them a copie signed by three publick Notaries, of what passed between the Queen and the Com|missioners of all the Cities and Towns in the Kingdom, that had Votes in Parlament.

Where|unto shee answered to this effect, That shee loved that Coun|trie

and her Subjects with so much tenderness, that it grieved her exceedingly to hear of any of their sufferings, But shee had been so long mued up there, and alwaies such bad People about her, who fed her with falsities and lies, insomuch that shee knew not of her Father's death, nor of their opression, And that when shee was informed of those strangers coming into <HI>Castilla,</HI> it troubled her very much, yet shee thought it might bee for her Children's good, though, it seemed, it proved otherwise. But shee wondred much at them that they did not revenge themselvs, if any thing was don contrarie to Ju|stice. And forasmuch (said shee) as you intend to remedie the ill-government of the affairs of the Kingdom, it doth re|joyce me, and if you do it not let it lye upon your own Consciences, besides I Command you so to do, and as far as lyeth in my power, I shall bee readie to do any thing for the good of the Kingdom, here or whereso&euml;ver I am.

<P>THe Cardinal, governor of the Kingdom, seeing the dis|turbed estate of things, and that in <HI>Valladolid</HI> hee was not
<PB N="177" REF="94">
obeyed, as the dignitie of his person and place required, but rather in danger daiely to bee affronted, took a resolution to re|tire himself to a Gentleman's hous out of the Citie, where hee might bee secure. This was no sooner known in <HI>Val|ladolid,</HI> but some of the Citie-Officers came to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">peake with him, desiring to know wherefore hee would go away from them. The Holy man with much meekness, answered, that hee would willingly retire himself with the Lord Admiral at <HI>Medina de Rioseco.</HI> But those of <HI>Valladolid,</HI> holding it their best waie to keep him there, would not let him go. They present|ly set guards at the Gates of the Citie, that none of the Com|mon people should go out, for they began already to feare, lest they should go joyn with the Lord high Constable, who was levying forces to resist and suppress those Tumults, which were grown so excessive in the Kingdom, to whom were repaired those of Council, that escaped from <HI>Valladolid,</HI> to the end that <HI>Castilla,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cardinal indeavouring to go out of <HI>Valladolid</HI> is stopped by the people.</NOTE> might not remain without Justice. The next morning early the Cardinal, beeing fully resolved to bee gon, departed from his hous with an hundred and fiftie men on horsback and on foot, besides divers of the principal persons of the Citie, who guarded him on both sides. But coming to the bridg they would not let him pass, there hee stayed a good while, still commanding his people to bee quiet and offer no violence, for they would have broke down the Gates and forced their way through. This beeing known in the Citie, there was presently a great hubbub, and a cry|ing out, <HI>The Governor's goeing away, The Governor's goeing away.</HI> Hereupon one <HI>Alonso de Vera,</HI> a Deputie of a ward, without any Command or Order from the Captain Generall of the Commonaltie, ran in great hast to ring the Council Bell, which beeing heard the Citie presently took the Alarme, and in a trice there was such a hurly-burly and confusion of people in the stree<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, that it was wonderful, they all locked up their houses and shops and posted with their Arms towards the bridg, (as if the Citie had been stormed by an enemie) where in a moment's time (in a manner) was assembled a very
<PB N="178" REF="95">
numerous Armie of compleat men, with new shining arms, but without order and without Captain. The Cardinal see|ing this tumult, turned back againe towards the Citie, and beeing half way ouer the bridg some of his servants said to him, <HI>My Lord! your Eminence should do well to stand still there, un|till you see what is the meaning of this boldness of the People.</HI> So hee did remain a while, having a strong guard before him. But the people came swarming to that place like emmets. Whilest the Cardinal was at this stand, came <HI>Don Pedro Giron,</HI> to whom all the people bore as much respect, as if hee had been their Lord. Hee was mounted upon a stately Ginnet, his body was covered with Armor as bright as silver, his head with a richly guilded helmet, his hors proudly praunsing along the streets, made waie through the disorderly throng, untill hee came where the Governor stood, to whom after salutation,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Don Pedro Gi|ron's</HI> speech to the Cardinal, persuading him to return to his Palace&punc;</NOTE> hee thus spake. <HI>My Lord! I am sorry that your Eminence would offer to go away thus without the consent of the Citie and Kingdom, if my Counsel might prevail, you should return to your lodging, for if you stay longer here, it will not bee in the power of man to remedie or hinder the mischief, which your departure may produce.</HI> The Cardinal's men not throughly understanding <HI>Don Pedro's</HI> speech, began to draw their swords; which some of the people, that had crowded neer, seeing, cryed out, <HI>Arm, Arm Commoners, help, help.</HI> Hereupon grew such a noise and so great a tumult, that had not the President of the Chancerie, <HI>Don Pedro Giron,</HI> and other Gentlemen been there to appease the furie of the people, they scarse had left one man alive of all those that were with the Cardinal. But all beeing pacified, hee returned with his guards to his lodging, accompanied with other Prelates and divers Gentlemen of qualitie, and after all, followed his traine of bagage in the same order as they marched outwards. The Common People went be|fore him all armed, with sound of drums and trumpets con|ducting him to his lodging, with all due honor and reverence. By this time it was full twelve of the clock, so that they spent six hours at least in this contention. The <HI>Infante</HI> of <HI>Granada,</HI>

Captain of <HI>Valladolid,</HI> was so much displeased that S^t <HI>Michael's</HI> Bell had been rung, and that the people had all taken Arms in that manner without his order or knowledg, that hee threatned to leave his charge. Thereupon strict order was given, that no man thenceforwards should dare, under a great penaltie, to ring the Bell or to rise in Arms, without their Captains order. <HI>Vera</HI> who rung the Bell, to avoid the punish|ment which was intended, and his offence deserved, fled to <HI>Tordesillas.</HI> After this, <HI>Valladolid</HI> ordered that every five and twentie men should have a particular Captain, that should command them upon occasion, having first received orders from the Captain General. The newes beeing carried to <HI>Tor|desillas,</HI> how those of <HI>Valladolid</HI> had opposed and detained the Cardinal, besides the good order they kept for the guard and defens of their Citie, The <HI>Iunta</HI> sent an express with Letters to give the People thanks in their names, extolling their valor to the skies, which puffed up the people's hearts with a kinde of vanitie, and incouraged them to commit greater exorbitan|cies another time.</P>

<P>THe Cardinal seeing it was not possible for him to go publickly out of <HI>Valladolid,</HI> and considering how much it behoved him to depart thence, where hee had no more then an honorable prison, resolved to steal away privately: which hee did one night all alone, beeing disguised, and hee had been gone ten daies before it was known in the Citie, or his own Guard of Hors missed him. His Foot Guards went away the daie before by two and two. After which time hee sent to entreat the Citie, to suffer his goods to bee brought unto him, assuring them that his going away should bee no waie pre|judicial to them, that hee was in a manner enforced so to ab|sent himself from them, both for respect of his Majestie's ser|vice,
<PB N="180" REF="96">
and that hee had not left him wherewithal to defraie his charges in the Citie, but whereso&euml;ver hee was, they might bee confident hee would do all that might be for their<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and the whole Kingdom's good. <HI>Valladolid,</HI> with much complement and civil expressions, sent him all his Linnens and other hous|hold-stuff to the Town of <HI>Rioseco,</HI> whither hee was gone in exspectation of the Lord Admiral. About this time there were great differences betwixt those of the Commonaltie, and their Captain the <HI>Infante</HI> of <HI>Granada.</HI> They would have killed him, manie of them coming violently against him with their Arms, and giving him very reproachful and abusive language. As hee advanced into the market place with above six hun|dred Lances to apprehend <HI>Alonso de Vera,</HI> (they saie) it was a Bridle-maker and som such like audacious fellows, that were the occasion of stirring the people to this insolent attempt. The <HI>Iunta</HI> beeing much displeased <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ereat ordered that the <HI>Infan|te</HI> of <HI>Granada</HI> should leav the Office of Captain, becaus it was too great a charge to allow him everie month 30000 <HI>Maradiz,</HI> alleging moreover, that none but a native of the Citie, ought to execute that Command. But the <HI>Infante</HI> giving notice of his discontent, by command of the <HI>Iunta</HI> this matter was put to Votes, and hee having the major part on his side, it was ordered, that hee should bee confirmed in his Office, but withal, that hee should pardon <HI>Alonso de Vera,</HI> with the rest that had offended him, and strict command was given, that the people should make no more meetings, nor demand any thing from thenceforward with Arms in their hands, but by waie of Justice and Reason.

<P>WHil'st the Commonaltie of <HI>Valladolid</HI> was in con|sultation, whether the <HI>Infante</HI> should continue in his Charge or not, arrived a Commissioner from the <HI>Junta,</HI> desiring that Citie in their names to agree, and bee all as one, and not to give waie to their particular pas|sions, which might breed division among them, to the great weakning and disenabling of that Citie, for they were now to consider that they had manie enemies, who had already begun one of the highest and greatest attempts in the world. <HI>That</HI> if their hearts were not united &amp; stirred up therewith, they, with their wives and children, should bee reduced to most wretched slaverie. <HI>That</HI> with couragious mindes and upright desires, they ought to prosecute this matter, and bee as|sistant to those Gentlemen who were already engaged therein, and bo&uuml;y them up out of that gulf of miserie whereinto they were plunged.

Several prodigious signs pre|saged this miserable dissention in <HI>Valencia.</HI> In the yeare 1517. The river which runneth by the Citie of <HI>Valencia,</HI> so shallow that somtimes there is scarse any water, on a sodain swelled, and overflowed the bankes in such manner, that it put those

Manie daies and nights, was seen running along the streets a furious great Lyon, which made so hideous a roaring that the people ran trembling away from it, and if any had the courage to stay, and see what it would do, they could see nothing. Other strange sights were likewise reported to have been observed there in the yeares 1517, and 1518. You have heard how the Emperor, before his departure from the <HI>Groyn,</HI> appointed for <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> of <HI>Valencia Don Diego de Mendosa,</HI> son to the Cardinal <HI>Don Pedro Gonsalez de Mendosa,</HI> and brother to <HI>Don Rodrigo Marquis</HI> of <HI>Cenete.</HI> Who executing his command and charge in <HI>Valencia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Confed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|rates of <HI>Vale<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+cia.</HI></NOTE> whenas the people, already linked in a Confederaoie, began to stand in a competition with the Nobles, to molest and prosecute the Gentrie, abusing their servants and vassals with great audacitie and disrespect: It hapned that two <HI>Morisco's</HI> vvho belonged to <HI>Don Ramon de Cardona,</HI> Lord of <HI>Castalla,</HI> passing along the street of <HI>Nuestra Seniora de Gracia,</HI> which was in that part of the Citie, where most of the meaner sort of people lived; Some Trades-men, that were working at their dores, flouted and laughed at them as they used to do, but the <HI>Morisco's</HI> answering them they presently rose in Arms, and cut one of them so grievously that hee died; And beeing about to kill the other also, who defended himself, a man by chance pass|ing by (whose name was <HI>Diego Pisador,</HI> by trade a salt-maker) took compassion of the poor fellow, and did what hee could to defend him. Whereat those Towns-men were so incensed that leaving the other they ran after this <HI>Diego Pisador,</HI> follow|ing him quite through the Citie to his own hous (whither hee fled to save his life) and fell a storming it in a furious manner about mid daie, the officers of Justice not daring to gain-saie them. The Priests of S^t <HI>Nicholas</HI> Church (which was close by that hous) came forth all with the Holie <HI>Sacra|ment,</HI> at the nois of this Combustion, to pacifie the furie of the People, which their presence and intreaties did somwhat mitigate. But <HI>Diego Pisador,</HI> not holding himself secure in
<PB N="186" REF="99">
his hous, thought it a safer waie to take sanctuary in the Church; so beeing come down, the Priest that carried the <HI>Sacrament,</HI> took him next unto him, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o advanced towards the Church; which the people seeing, they violently ran a|gain upon him, and killed him with their daggers. Upon this, came amongst them one <HI>Avendanio</HI> a Cloath-worker, who was the Autor and chief of this confedracie (it vvas thought) to hinder and keep them from doing mischief, but seeing that man so barbarosly killed, hee vvent presently into a hous, vvhere hee burst and died miserably (som saie) for anger and grief, to see such excessive disorder. These and manie other such like outrages vvere done by the People of <HI>Valencia,</HI> before the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mperor departed, whereof his Majestie was advertised by the Nobles and Gentlemen of that Citie; and hee referred it to <HI>Xeures,</HI> but hee beeing more sollicitous for the transporting of his treasure, then the remedying of the troubles in <HI>Spain,</HI> neglected it. All that was ordered herein, was to remit the quelling and reducing that People to reason, to the care of the <HI>Infante Dou Enrique, Duke</HI> of <HI>Sego<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">be,</HI> but the People beeing launched into the depth of mischief, slighted his Autoritie; which manifestly declared the rebellion and pernicious intentions of that Confederacie. Soon after, a man condemned for haynous crimes beeing led along to exe|cution, the People came out with Arms, and rescued him from the officers of Justice, abusing and ill treating them in a horrid manner. No Noblemen or Gentlemen could pass through the streets, but those of the Confederacie would deride and flout them with base reviling language. Inso|much that a Hat-maker's wife, dressing a Hat at the door, with her children about her, as some Gentlemen were go|ing by, shee bid the children look at those men that passed there, and the boyes asking her why shee bid them look at them, shee answered, Becaus when you are grown up to bee men, you may say, that you have seen Gen|tlemen. This the woman said, becaus the Common People were then in the minde to destroie all the
<PB N="187" REF="99">
Gentrie of the whole Kingdom root and branch. <HI>Aven|danio</HI> the Cloth-worker beeing dead, the Confederates chose another Captain, one of the same trade as the former, his name was <HI>Sorolla,</HI> a pestilent audacious villain, who a|mongst other wicked facts, went to the Citie Hall, when they were consulting about the Election of <HI>Iurates,</HI> and with a confident impudence told those of the <HI>Regimiento,</HI> in the name of his <HI>Confederacie,</HI> that if they did not admit them to bee of the <HI>Regimiento,</HI> those stones should flow with blood. And his threats were accomplished; for they made their Election ac|cording to the rights and custom of the Citie. Whereat the people were so enraged, that they committed those outrages which shall bee set down hereafter. In this distemper and ex|travagant hare-brainedness, <HI>Don Diego de Mendosa</HI> found the mindes of the people in <HI>Valencia,</HI> when hee came to bee their Governor. <HI>Sorolla, Vicente Periz,</HI> one <HI>Iohn Caro,</HI> and other lead|ing men of the <HI>Confederacie,</HI> understanding that the Vice-Roy had been fully informed of their demeanors, and of the state of things, but yet dissembled the knowledg thereof out of fear, considering what power and credite their <HI>Confederacie</HI> had with the people: they complotted that <HI>Sorolla</HI> should hide himself in his own hous, and that the rest should go up and down the Citie and acquaint all his friends and allies that the Vice-Roy had sent for <HI>Sorolla,</HI> and that (as they were inform|ed) hee either had already hanged him, or was then about it, and that for manie respects, they ought not to let such a man suffer, who was the defendor and mainteiner of the publick good. This report beeing thus cunningly spread through the whole Citie, so incensed the people's mindes, that in an in|stant all was up in Arms, Drums beating, and Colours flying, and in this manner they marched to the Vice-Roy's hous, cry|ing out, <HI>Let the Vice-Roy die, if hee deliver us not Sorolla.</HI> The Vice-Roy, and som Gentlemen that were in the hous at that time with him, besides his servants, defended the windows and doors, where the assault was hottest all daie long, and night beeing com (as God would have it) a good woman one

The other Gen|tlemen having left their wives and children in secure places, with what arms, horses, and men they could get toget<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er, re|paired

som to the Vice-Roy, others to the <HI>Infante Don Enrique,</HI> and to the Duke of <HI>Segorbe Don Alonso,</HI> agreeing all unanimous|ly to adhere to the Emperor's service against the Rebels. All these Gentlemen's houses within the Citie, the people plucked down or burned, and plundered their goods; a thousand more abominable mischiefs they did, which I am ashamed to relate (so cruel and unruly is that Beast, the Common Peo|ple when it hath broke the bridle.) They armed all the slaves, and received manie <HI>Moriscos</HI> for souldiers. From <HI>Cozentayna</HI> the Vice-Roy went to <HI>Xativa</HI>; the Inhabitants of that Citie de|sired him to give them leav to muster upon S^t <HI>Bartholomew</HI>'s daie, which hee denying, they marched out of the Citie in de|spight and contempt of him, and mustered before his face. The Vice-Roy hereupon, fearing a second trick of <HI>Valencia,</HI> re|tired into the Fort, which those of <HI>Xativa</HI> perceiving, they pro|claimed, that no bodie, under pain of death, should furnish him with victuals, or anie provision whatso&euml;ver. Hereupon hee went from thence to <HI>Denia,</HI> becaus if hee was pursued by land, hee might escape thence by sea. Those of <HI>Valencia,</HI> hear|ing that the Vice-Roy was fled to <HI>Denia,</HI> after that <HI>Xativa</HI> had rebelled against him, resolved to seiz upon all the King's Reve|nues and Customs: which to effect, they went to the Custom houses and broke the Records, took away the Books, and spoke words which were wors then their deeds. Those of <HI>Valencia,</HI> seeing themselvs masters of the Citie, the Vice-Roy and all the Gentrie beeing gone, they ordered the Government thereof. They appointed thirteen persons to govern and defend it, whom they call'd the <HI>Thirteen</HI> of the <HI>Confederacie.</HI> These Thir|teen chose for the General of their Armie <HI>Iohn Caro,</HI> (who was a Sugar-baker) and held intelligence with the whole Kingdom: Insomuch that assoon as the news was heard of the Rebelli|on of <HI>Valencia</HI> and <HI>Xativa,</HI> and that the Vice-Roy was fled, pre|sently the Citie of <HI>Oribuela</HI> &amp; the <HI>Marquisat</HI> of <HI>Helche</HI> did the like, and at length there was no Citie or Town but rebelled also, in imitation of <HI>Valencia,</HI> treating the Gentrie and nobler Citizens with the like dis-respect and tyrannie. And the Gentrie, with
<PB N="190" REF="101">
their servants, arms, goods, and all they could get, joined toge|ther in their King's service. So that (which is a thing wor|thie of note and esteem) there was not one Gentleman, nor person of any birth or qualitie through that whole Kingdom that sided with that vile <HI>Commonaltie,</HI> but valiantly and unani|mously ventured their lives and fortunes in their Prince's ser|vice, although hee was out of the Kingdom; they suffered patiently their houses to bee pulled down, their goods to bee burned, their towns destroied, and all to shew their fidelitie to their King. The Citie of <HI>Oribuela</HI> chose for their Captain one <HI>Palomares,</HI> who made himself so absolute Lord of those people (beeing but a poor Serving-man) that often|times hee drew out five thousand men into the field to fight, though hee paied dearly for it afterwards. The <HI>Confederates,</HI> having lost their respect to the Vice-Roy, a|greed to lose likewise the fear of God. They made a Conspi|racie amongst them, the result whereof was to rob and take away all the riches of the Monasteries and Churches. Which beeing discovered, the loial Partie desired <HI>Don Rodrigo de Men|dosa</HI> Marquess of <HI>Cenete,</HI> to take upon him the Autoritie of the Justice for the King, which hee did, and like a good resolute Gentleman, hee hung up three or four of the chief Conspirators, and so the robberie which they intended was prevented, and the Citie quieted for certain daies. But soon after the Confe|derates marched into the field towards <HI>Denia,</HI> to drive the Vice-Roy out of the Kingdom. Ten thousand men in Arms <HI>Va|lencia</HI> furnished to that effect. The Clergie with their Hoods upon their heads, and Crosses in their hands, stood all at the gate of <HI>San Vicente,</HI> and as the Confederates passed by them, the Priests and Friers said to them, Sirs! <HI>Misericordia, Misericordia</HI>; and they answered, swearing, <HI>Cuerpo de Dios, Iusticia, Iusticia.</HI> And indeed God's Justice did abundantly fall upon their heads; for the greatest part of those that answered so, were ei|ther killed in battle, or executed by Justice afterwards. <HI>Iohn Caro</HI> and <HI>Sorolla</HI> were Captains of this Armie. The Confede|rates having the sole power and command of <HI>Valencia, Iohn
<PB N="191" REF="101">
Caro</HI> was sent with a sufficient force to besiege the Castle of <HI>Corbera,</HI> six leagues from <HI>Valencia,</HI> which while hee was batter|ing with some peeces of Artillerie, <HI>Don Geronimo Vique</HI> (who at that time was at a Monasterie of Friers of the order of <HI>San Geronimo,</HI> half a league from the Castle) desired to speak with him, who, overcom with his persuasions and powerful rea|sons, raised his siege. Which the Thirteen of the <HI>Confederacie</HI> hearing, took t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Office of Captain General from <HI>Iohn Caro,</HI> and conferred it upon <HI>Sorolla.</HI> By this time the Vice-Roy, with some forces, which hee had raised, was came to <HI>Gandia,</HI> to succor the Castle of <HI>Corbera</HI>; And <HI>Sorolla</HI> with his Armie went seeking the Vice-Roy: as hee passed hee ruined and spoyled all the places, that belonged to <HI>Don Geronimo Vique,</HI> becaus hee had persuaded <HI>Iohn Caro</HI> to leave the Castle. At last coming to <HI>Gandia,</HI> hee met with the Vice-Roy's Armie and gave them battle, wherein manie were killed on both sides, but at length the Confederates won the daie, and the Vice-Roy, with the Earl of <HI>Oliva,</HI> and divers other Lords and Gentlemen that re|mained alive, were inforced to retreat to <HI>Denia,</HI> whither <HI>Sorol|la</HI> with his men still pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sued them. And beeing arrived at a town called <HI>Vergel</HI> (one league short of <HI>Denia</HI>) <HI>Mossen Bal|tazar Vives,</HI> Lord of that place, refreshed them, and afterwards conveied them safe to <HI>Denia,</HI> where hee imbarked for <HI>Penisco|la,</HI> whence they w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt to the town of <HI>Morella,</HI> where they rais|ed more men. <HI>Sorolla</HI> returned to <HI>Valencia,</HI> where hee entered with his Armie very joiful and content with his conquest. By this time the Duke of <HI>Segorbe Don Alonso de Aragon</HI> was com in|to the field with above four thousand Foot, and divers gentle|men with their servants and others on hors-back, to the num|ber of one hundred and sixtie, whereof was Captain <HI>Don Jayme Ferrer,</HI> son to <HI>Don Luis Ferrer,</HI> who was Lord Steward to the Queen <HI>Donia Iuana,</HI> at <HI>Tordesillas.</HI> And beeing quarte|red at <HI>Almenara,</HI> a league and half from <HI>Monviedro</HI> with intent to besiege it, which was the strongest and most considerable Fort the Confederates had, but four leagues from <HI>Valencia</HI>; no|tice was given him that the enemie appeared with no less then
<PB N="192" REF="102">
eight thousand Foot and some Hors, fleshed with their Victo|rie over the Vice-Roy, and recruited with many fresh men from <HI>Valencia.</HI> Whereupon the Duke sent <HI>Don Iayme</HI> with the Hors to discover, and according to his advice, hee would fol|low as speedily as might bee with the Foot. This was car|ried with so much discretion and valor, that the Duke gave them an absolute rout, leaving above five thousand men dead upon the place, for which it is called to this daie, <HI>The field of slaughter.</HI> This Victorie restored the Kingdom, which if it had otherwise succeeded, the Common People had become absolute Masters without any contradiction. Things beeing in this condition, the <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> returned with a fresh supplie, and incamped his Armie about <HI>Alcira</HI> and <HI>Xativa</HI>; The People were som|what amazed, and startled at the rout the Duke had given them. Yet those of <HI>Alcira</HI> and <HI>Xativa</HI> marched out very strong to meet with the <HI>Vice-Roy,</HI> and finding him a league from the Citie, they gave him battle, the conflict was so hot, and so well maintained on both sides, that it was hard to saie which had the advantage, the combate continued all daie, and at night both Armies beeing very wearie, and great store of men hurt, they were both glad to retreat, seeking re|freshment and medicaments to dress their wounded men. About this time the Cities of <HI>Oribuela</HI> and <HI>Alicante,</HI> with all the Towns and Places under their jurisdiction, associated themselvs with the People of <HI>Valencia.</HI> But all the Gentrie and persons of qualitie followed their Governor <HI>Don Pedro Masa,</HI> who was inforced to quit those two Cities, and the Castle of <HI>Oribuela,</HI> whereof hee was Governor. But <HI>Don Iayme de Puyg,</HI> a valorous Gentleman (who was Lievtenant of the Castle under the Governor) with fifteen or sixteen men defended himself gallantly against the furie of the Com|mon people, when in their violentest heat they killed, burned and sacked the Gentlemen's houses. The <HI>Marquis de los Ve|lez, Don Pedro Faxardo, Adelantado Mayor</HI> (that is Lord Deputie or Lord Lievtenant) of the Kingdom of <HI>Murcia,</HI> having
<PB N="193" REF="102">
notice of the rising of <HI>Oribuela,</HI> levied what force hee could, and marched to reliev the distressed Gentrie, having order from the Emperor, to assist the Governor of <HI>Oribuela</HI> upon all occasions. <HI>Don Pedro Maca</HI> with his hors, beeing joyned with the <HI>Marquis de los Velez,</HI> the Common People of <HI>Oribuela,</HI> and the jurisdiction thereof, (who were above eight thou|sand) marched in pursuit of them to the top of a moun|tain, called <HI>Rajolar,</HI> with intent to give them battle, their in|tilligence assuring them that they were far the greater number. The Governor advised with the Marquis about relieving the Castle of <HI>Oribuela,</HI> which was in great necessitie, every one of his Troopers carrying in, a sack of provision behinde him, whilest the Marquess amused the enemie with skirmishes, for hee doubted not to bee back with him time enough to dis|comfit them. This was don accordingly, and beeing drawn up in <HI>Batalia,</HI> the Marquis secured the waie to the Castle, that the Governor might go thither with his Hors, and having put in his provisions, return to the battle, which was dexte|rously and successively effected, with the slaughter of above four thousand of the Rebells: So the Marquis cleared all the Countrie about <HI>Oribu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">la.</HI> But seeing how infected the whole Kingdom was, and what multitudes of people were com in to the Commoners, encouraged by their Victorie (for it is the nature of the Common people to follow the strongest partie) he advanced higher into the Countrie with his Armie, which daily increased, insomuch that before hee could reach <HI>Valencia,</HI> hee had above eleven thousand men and thirteen pieces of Ordnance, wherewith hee encamped at a place called <HI>Paterna,</HI> within sight of <HI>Valencia,</HI> and sent the Citie a Summons, which beeing surrendred upon Articles, and the Vice-Roy re|possessed of his Command, the Marquis returned with his Armie to <HI>Murcia.</HI> After his departure, the Articles beeing not well performed, the Confederates retired themselvs to <HI>Xativa,</HI> where they chose for their Captain one <HI>Vicente Perez</HI> a fellow whose trade was to gather Acorns. They assaulted and entred the Fort, it beeing ill provided. Besides the aforemen|tioned,
<PB N="194" REF="103">
there were divers strange presages in <HI>Valencia</HI> of these prodigious disorders; amongst others, upon a Tuesda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e the 27 of <HI>Maie</HI> in the evening, a Thunder-bolt fell upon a Church called <HI>El Asseu de Valencia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Other Prodi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ious signs in <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lencia.</HI></NOTE> which threw down one of the Pin|nacles, and burst the Clock in pieces. Upon a Fridaie morning in the same month, fell a sudden storm of hail, with most ter|rible Thunder-claps, after which, in a ground betwixt the Countie of <HI>Oliva</HI> and Dutchie of <HI>Gandia,</HI> were found three stones (which fell from the skie) in colour and make like flints. <HI>Fray Antonio de Guevara</HI> Chronicler to his Imperial Ma|jestie, and Bishop of <HI>Mondoniedo,</HI> reporteth, that hee saw one of them hung in a chain in <HI>Santa Maria</HI> Church, a league from <HI>Oliva,</HI> which weighed no less then five and twentie pounds. The passage which I am now about to relate is so remarkable, that men cannot but admire the blindness which possessed the miserable people that affected these novelties and Insurrections. There was nothing more certainly known in <HI>Spain,</HI> then that the Prince <HI>Don Iohn</HI> (onely issue male of his father and mother, the Catholick Kings, and immediate Heir to these Kingdoms) died at <HI>Salamanca,</HI> to the exceeding grief and resentment of his parents and all <HI>Spain,</HI> and in those daies there was no further scruple or question thereof. But since in the time of these unhappie Commotions, the Confederates of <HI>Valencia</HI> were so besotted, that a strange mean fellow of no ac|compt (who came in a fugitive manner out of <HI>Africa,</HI> and associated himself with them) that they received him, and beleiving, or seeming to believ him, to bee the <HI>Prince Don Iohn,</HI> they swore allegeance to him, as King, and hee Com|manded and ruled over them for two years, until hee met with the end hee deserved, as shall bee seen hereafter. In the year of our Lord 1512, a certain Merchant of <HI>Biscaya,</HI> named <HI>Iuan de Vilvao,</HI> or <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Bilbo,</HI> went to trade at the Citie of <HI>Oran.</HI> In the ship which carried him and his commodities, hee light upon a passenger, who addressing himself to him, told him that hee could write and read in several languages, and that if hee pleased to give him any competent subsistence,
<PB N="195" REF="103">
hee would bee glad to serv him as his factor, and teach his children; the Merchant entertained him, and took him on board with him at <HI>Cartagena,</HI> thinking himself the happiest man living, that hee had so luckily met with a man of such abilities to instruct his children and follow his business be|sides. This fellow was of a low stature, thin-faced, of a sal|low complexion, hee had a terrible look, his eies beeing of a black and green color, little hair, and thin upon his head, his beard wors furnished; hee was a man of verie few words, in his Conversation somwhat too strict and austere, seeming|ly intemperate in his diet, a great eater, but drank little, hee spoke <HI>Spanish, Arabick,</HI> and <HI>Hebrew.</HI> It never was known di|rectly who his father was, onely hee confessed, while hee was under the lash, that hee was a Jew's son, and that hee was Circumcised, but never Baptized, for his father carried him into <HI>Barberie,</HI> in the same year the Jews were driven out of <HI>Castilla.</HI> Hee remained in this Merchant's hous until the year 1516, which vvas four years: and to ingratiate himself the more vvith his Master, hee told him, thenceforvvards hee vvould call himself by his name <HI>Iuan de Vilvao.</HI> But the Merchant having occasion to absent himself often from his hous, leaving his wife, children, and goods, all in charge with this servant, one time at his return from <HI>Castilla,</HI> hee was told by his neighbors that <HI>Iuan de Vilvao,</HI> his man, was a slepperie companion, and that in his absence hee was too familiar with his wife; others said, hee had abused his daughter. Hereupon without any further examination, hee turned him presently out of his hous, not declaring anie occa|sion, or reason hee had for so doing, becaus hee could not have his servant punished otherwise, without bringing his own honor in question. At that time there was a young man <HI>Corre|gidor</HI> of <HI>Oran,</HI> who not knowing wherefore the Merchant had discarded his servant <HI>Iuan de Vilvao,</HI> entertained him to bee his Steward. The <HI>Corregidor</HI> having a handsom young wench, which hee kept privately in his hous, <HI>Iuan de
<PB N="196" REF="104">
Vilvao</HI> used all means possible to gain her acquaintance and affection, and withall to persuade her to learn witchcraft; for amongst other good qualities, this wicked fellow was a great Practitioner in Negromancie. The young maid beeing little pleased with his sollicitations, resolved at last to acquaint the <HI>Corregidor,</HI> how hee importuned her, and that hee would per|suade her to learn witchcraft, but chiefly that hee had made her promise to give him poison, that so they two might with more freedom enjoie each other's affection. The <HI>Corregidor</HI> was much startled and amazed hereat, for hee thought his hous and Paramour as secure with <HI>Iuan de Vilvao,</HI> as if hee had committed her to the custodie of an Eunuch, and therefore hee did not absolutely credit her accusation of him; but after|wards observing with a more strict eie the carriage and de|meanure of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">teward, hee was confirmed and satisfied of the truth, especially when hee found the spells and poison w^c^h he was to use. Hee committed him to the publick Gaol, whence upon a market daie hee was fetch't out, set upon an Ass, with his sorceries about his neck, and whipped through all the principal streets of the Citie. The people were all asto|nished that hee should bee so close a villain, for every bodie had a very good opinion of him; After this, beeing banish|ed <HI>Oran,</HI> hee returned into <HI>Spain,</HI> and dis-embarked upon the Coast of <HI>Valencia,</HI> just in the time of these disastrous troubles. Hee, by his juggling inventions, begat himself a great esteem and credit first amongst the Confederates of <HI>Algecira.</HI> After|wards hee came to <HI>Xativa,</HI> under the name of <HI>Don Henrique Manrique de Ribera,</HI> and beeing a subtil Impostor, and the Con|federates simple, and besotted with passion, hee wrought so much upon their blinde credulitie, that they made him their General, and by little and little hee so in|veagled them that they held him for their God, and their King. <HI>Vicente Periz</HI> (who was Captain General of the Confederate Rebels of <HI>Valencia</HI>) made great submissions to him, saying, that God had sent him to give them libertie, and that hee
<PB N="197" REF="104">
would procure them much monie and arms. Those of <HI>Xati|va</HI> adored him as their Redeemer, and called him <HI>El Encubierto,</HI> or the man disguised,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>El Encubiert<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI></NOTE> saying, God had sent him for the redress|ing of the oppressed People. Hee made them believ that hee was the <HI>Prince Don Iohn,</HI> Son to the Catholick King and Queen deceased, and that for certain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ecret causes and Revelati|ons of God's Judgments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The notable imposture of <HI>Iuan de Vilvao.</HI></NOTE> it was convenient for him not to bee publickly known in the world for long time past, but now since the Kingdom's were in so distressed a condition, and in so great necessitie of their naturall King, to own and defend them, and settle them in the same peaceable Govern|ment, as they injoyed during his Father's Reign, hee desired to reveal himself unto them, and that it was God's will also. This those wretched Confederates beleiving, followed and honored him, as if hee had been their God. Thus having gained the affection and esteem of these Rebels, hee conferred with divers of the Citie of <HI>Valencia,</HI> of <HI>la Huerta,</HI> and other places thereabouts, inticing them to put in execution what that Tyrant, <HI>Vicente Periz,</HI> had alreadie moved. Hee dealt likewise with some places of <HI>Aragon,</HI> and <HI>Catalunia</HI> (which were alreadie tottering and half, at least, inclining to Com|motion, ingaging them, that at the same instant (if pos|sible) as hee should make his Attempts upon <HI>Valencia,</HI> they should all rise in arms, and secure those parts for him. With|in <HI>Valencia</HI> hee had his intelligencers, and instruments, whom hee imployed to murder the Marquis of <HI>Cenete,</HI> then Govern|or of the Citie; These were so faithful to him in this treacherous design, that hee wanted not assistants to convey him over the walls into the Citie, whereby hee might the better contrive his plot, seeing the disposition of the place, and (having a more free communication with the inhabi|tants) allure and draw to his byas more complices, to strengthen his partie, and execute his wicked intention. This was so cunningly carried, that if God had not otherwise disposed it, the whole Kingdom at that time ran a notable hazard of beeing absolutely destroied. The Citie of <HI>Valencia</HI>
<PB N="198" REF="105">
(as I have told you) beeing in so miserable a condition, the Religious men, with other good and loial people, went to petition the Marquis of <HI>Cenete</HI> (who then was in the Camp) to take upon him the Government of that distressed Ci|tie. Which hee did (like a noble man as hee was). The people expressed so much contentment and comfort in his presence, that in all the Monasteries and Churches, they sung with great solemnitie, the <HI>Te Deum laudamus,</HI> and all the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lls rung out in testimonie of an universal joie. The Marquis was a man of such courage and resolution, that when, throughout the whole Citie of <HI>Valencia,</HI> no bodie durst so much as name <HI>God, King</HI> or <HI>Iustice,</HI> hee took divers of the re|bellious disturbers and hanged them. So that they began to bee affraid, and sculked in corners. Soon after having notice of a band of these Confederates, which were fled from <HI>Valen|cia,</HI> hee marched out against them, and meeting them about <HI>Monviedro,</HI> hee brought away their Colors, having routed and put them all to flight. Amongst divers great hazards which the Marquis ran of losing his life, by the insolence or treacherie of these Confederates, one I shall give in particular; A mon|strous disorderly multitude of these wretches beeing gathe|red together in <HI>Valencia,</HI> fell like a furious storm upon the Mar|quis his hous, with huge clamorous out-cries and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lashing of weapons, not understanding each other's minde, nor know|ing what they would have. The Marquis hearing the nois, went down to quiet the tumult, beeing well provided and at|tended, but his Ladie seeing him engaged amongst a throng of such vile respectless people, and fearing lest hee should bee murthered by them, took such a fright, that her weak Consti|tution beeing not able to resist the violence of that sudden ap|prehension, shee presently expired. <HI>Vicente Periz</HI> Captain of the Rebells, with a numerous Armie intrenched himself and planted his Cannon within sight of <HI>Valencia,</HI> where hee re|mained som time: In his Camp hee had a bell, at the sound whereof a numberless gang of thievs, such as his Armie was composed of, ran out of the Citie to him: And had not the
<PB N="199" REF="105">
Marquis been very circumspect, without question they had suprised the Citie; but finding little probabilitie of effecting their design upon <HI>Valencia,</HI> they marched towards <HI>Monviedro,</HI> thinking to make the Vice-Roy rais his siege thence, but within two daies after <HI>Monviedro</HI> was surrendered to him (which was of no small importance) for thereby hee had an open and free passage to receiv succour out of <HI>Castilla.</HI> The Marquis hearing that the Confederates were marched to|wards <HI>Monviedro</HI> with their Cannon, and having intelligence of their intentions, followed them (but with no consider|able force) and meeting some of his own foot companies, which having been much galled by their Cannon and small shot, were retreating towards <HI>Valencia</HI> quite disheartned, hee strove to incourage them as well as hee could, representing to them the service of God and their King; but prevailing not with them, how&euml;ver he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> advanced and set upon the enemie, crying aloud, <HI>Let the King live, and the Traytors die,</HI> and with|out fear of their muskets or Cannon, which played fiercely upon him, hee charged into the middest of them, God (whose caus hee fought) preserving him, and striking their baser hearts with fear, insomuch that hee had them all at his mercie. Yet his nobleness and generositie was such (though they deserved it not) that hee commanded his men (who were very busie in killing) to forbear further execution, cry|ing out, <HI>Let them not die, let them not die</HI>: having thus quite routed these Mutiniers, hee returned to <HI>Valencia</HI> with the spoil, and all their Artillerie, where hee was received with joy and tears. The Vice-Roy afterwards, beeing before <HI>Xativa,</HI> with intent to reduce it to the Emperor's subjection, the Re|bels dealt so cunningly with some of his Souldiers (who sowed the same dissention in his Camp, as was within the Town) that by certain signs they understood each others in|tentions, and they agreed at one and the same time to fall upon the Loyall Partie, and murther them; and having taken their Artillerie, to storm <HI>Valencia,</HI> sack it, and kill all that were for the Emperor in it. This conspiracie was discovered,
<PB N="200" REF="106">
but there was no remedie to hinder it, neither in the Vice-Roy's Camp, nor in <HI>Valencia</HI>; for the Confederates were very numerous and the Loyall P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">sons but a small Partie; The Marquis, at the intreatie of the honest people of <HI>Valencia,</HI> went to the Vice-Roy's Camp before <HI>Xativa,</HI> where hee found more disorder then was reported, and the infection less cura|ble then hee imagined. The sign that these Conspirators had agreed upon, was, that in the night at a certain hour those of the Camp should cry out, <HI>Paie, Paie, Mutinie, Mutinie,</HI> and those within the Citie should answer, <HI>Paie, Paie, Mutinie, Mutinie.</HI> The Vice-Roy and the Gentlemen with him in the Camp, desired the Marquis to venter himself, and indeavor by going into the Citie, and reasoning with the people, to de|fer the execution of this horrid treason: Although it seemed an act of great timeritie (as indeed it was) for him to ex|pose him<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">elf to the furie of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eople so mutinous, and bent upon mischief, yet the Marquis valorously did as hee was re|quired: And it was miraculous, how his presence and fair deportment pacified the inhabitants minds, and brought them to submit to reason. The Adversaries beeing mad at the good success the Marquis had wrought within <HI>Xativa,</HI> con|spired how <HI>Vicente Periz,</HI> their Captain might secretly convey himself into the Citie, and gathering as manie of the people, as hee could, together, apprehend the Marquis. This was effected, and <HI>Vicente Periz</HI> with a multitude of well armed men went to assault the Marquis, who beeing but slenderly provided, and weakly attended, and seeing a squadron of these thievs advance towards him, dissembled, and made as if hee knew them not, asking them thus, <HI>Are you our friends? do you com to serv the King?</HI> To which they answered neither yea, nor no, but seemed to bee daunted at the very sight of the Marquis. Hereupon with much seeming affection hee spake aloud, <HI>Nay then my boies, Viva el Rey; viva el Rey</HI>; which said, hee fell upon them, and took away their Arms. Presently upon this the rest of the e|nemies discovered themselvs, and began to fight, discharging
<PB N="201" REF="106">
their Cross-bows and Musket-shots as thick as hail against the Marquis and his men, which the Marquis seeing, hee cried with a loud voice, <HI>O you Traitors! now force is requisite</HI>; and flinging down his staff, hee took a pike, and saying, <HI>God preserv the King, and let the Traitors die</HI>; hee fell in amongst them, fighting so desperately, that before his men could com to se|cond him, hee had made them turn their backs, but at last be|ing over-powered and wounded in the left arm, hee was ta|ken prisoner, and carried by the people into the Castle, where at that time the Duke of <HI>Calabria</HI> was also prisoner, who re|ceived the Marquis with much honor. The Marquis was af|terwards put into a Dungeon under S^t <HI>George</HI>'s tower, where they kept him close prisoner som time, thinking thereby to make the Vice-Roy, his brother, condescend to what they listed: But at last hee was released, and perceiving the Coun|trie to bee infected beyond hope of remedie, hee retired to his own hous. Those of <HI>Valencia</HI> found a great miss of him, and seeing most of the people of the Citie becom of the Confede|racie, <HI>Vicente Periz</HI> having possessed himself of <HI>la Huerta,</HI> and other places thereabouts, the <HI>Iurates,</HI> and Chapter of the Church called <HI>el Asseu,</HI> sent to beseech him, that hee would bee pleased to condole the miserie of that Citie, and bee tender of the King's service. The Marquis was at <HI>Ayora,</HI> a town of his, &amp; up|on receipt of this message, hee took his waie towards <HI>Valencia.</HI> Thursdaie 27 <HI>Februarie,</HI> 1522, the Tyrant <HI>Vicente Perez,</HI> trust|ing to the multitude of his partie within the Citie, took the boldness to enter into <HI>Valencia,</HI> with intention to plunder it, and kill all that should resist him, and having intrenched and fortified himself within the walls to that effect, it struck great terrour into the loial partie. But the Marquis, well Armed, came to a large place, called <HI>la Placa del Asseu,</HI> and caused to bee rung that bell, which they used to ring in Uproars, to the end all those of the loial partie might repair thither to him; where hee staied until noon, having used all fair means possible to pacifie without blood-shed the advers partie; but seeing no|thing could avail, hee took a view of his men, and what
<PB N="202" REF="107">
Arms they had; and finding his no competent force to en|counter <HI>Vicente Periz,</HI> who had made himself very strong; hee betook himself to his invention and policie, which suc|ceeded so advantagiously, that <HI>Vicente Periz</HI> came short of his design, all his men beeing dis-banded, and returned to their own dwellings. This was a happie daie for <HI>Valencia,</HI> for if <HI>Periz</HI> his plot had taken, hee had been absolute master of the whole Citie; and ever after, that daie was called the Thurs|daie of <HI>Vicente Periz</HI>: Yet staying within the Citie hee rallied again, and what with those of <HI>Valencia,</HI> what with the fresh supplies which were sent him from <HI>Xativa,</HI> and <HI>Algezira,</HI> by the disguised Prince <HI>Don Iuan,</HI> or <HI>Iuan de Vilvao,</HI> who went thither to that purpose: Hee was so strongly recruited, that hee gave the Marquis Battle in the streets of <HI>Valencia,</HI> and had won the daie undoubtedly, if the Marquis had not shewed as much policie as resolution. In the Combate the Marquis pur|suing <HI>Vicente Periz</HI> (who was glad to take his heels) was knocked down by a great pot full of earth, which a woman flung from the top of a hous upon his head, which though it killed him not out-right, did stun and bruis him very sore: Hee was presently taken up again by his servants, but his par|tie supposing him to bee dead, lost courage, and withal the advantage they had gained of the enem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e: which hee perceiv|ing, assoon as hee was com again to himself, ran amongst them, saying, <HI>If the Marquis bee dead, the King is alive.</HI> These words put new vigor into the hearts of his despairing men, who following the Marquis, gave a fresh charge to the Con|federates, so hot, that they were glad to hous themselvs, which proved no Sanctuarie, for there they were killed and taken, not beeing able to make resistance. <HI>Vicente Periz</HI> had his head presently struck off. This Victorie quieted the Citie of <HI>Valen|cia,</HI> vvhich vvas so infected vvith the poison of Rebellion, that in the very Cloisters and Monasteries, there was as much division and passion as elswhere; insomuch that one part praied God to favor the Confederates, the other to give the Cavaliers the Victorie. The disguised Prince exspected a
<PB N="203" REF="107">
quite contrarie success, hoping by the death of the Marquis, and the routing of his partie, to reign victoriously in <HI>Valencia</HI>; but God,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iuan de Vilvao,</HI> or the disgui|sed Prince exe|cuted by the Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">quis of <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|nete</HI> in <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n|cia.</HI></NOTE> who had otherwise decreed the Event, made him likewise fall into the hands of the Marquis the 19^t^h of <HI>Maie,</HI> 1522, who commanded him to bee hanged, drawn and quar|tered, and his head to bee set upon the point of Lance. And thus that villanous head was crowned, who of an infamous Jew, and abominable Sorcerer, would have made himself King of <HI>Spain.</HI> After this grew several other Commotions in that Kingdom, but nothing near so dangerous; which I shall omit now to particularize, in regard I am called away by those of <HI>Castilla.</HI></P>

<P>THe Earl of <HI>Salvatierra,</HI> and other Mountaniers, infected the people of the Mountains of <HI>Burgos,</HI> as far as <HI>Alava</HI> and <HI>Vitoria,</HI> with other places of <HI>la Rioxa</HI>; and <HI>Burgos</HI> was very near revolting also. All which was opposed by the Lord High Constable, not becaus the Emperor commanded him so to do (for hee received no orders from his Majestie to that effect till afterwards) but moved with the magnanimitie of his own generous spirit, and the sens of Loialtie, which was Hereditarie to that noble familie. I do not finde that any of the Grandees of <HI>Castilla</HI> were very forward to break the ice in this undertaking, though afterwards, like honest men, they all set their helping hands. The Lord High Constable at first prudently feared the Event, and was loth to engage himself in so perillous an enterprise, hazarding no less then his life and whole estate, in endeavouring to oppose so manie, especially without arms, monie, or order from the Emperor. For the enemies were very manie and powerful, no less then thirteen of the most considerable Cities of <HI>Castilla,</HI> with divers other Towns and Villages, beeing declared for the Commonaltie;
<PB N="204" REF="108">
besides that many Gentlemen of qualitie &amp; great estates (much animated against the Emperor and his Ministers) had involved themselvs in the same Interest. It vvas an attempt of so much consideration and danger, that the other Grandees thought it the best vvay (seeing they vvere not able to do otherwise) to sit still and look on, and manie of them advised the Lord High Constable to do the like. But his Ladie <HI>Donia Maria de Tovar,</HI> onely daughter and heir to <HI>Don Luis de Tovar,</HI> Marquis of <HI>Ber|langa,</HI> beeing one of the discreetest and most magnanimous Ladies in all <HI>Spain</HI> of her time, was not of the opinion of those that gave her husband that Counsel; but she never ceased, representing to him the advancement of his Majestie's service, and that for the good of the Kingdom, hee ought to resist and suppress the exorbitances of the insulting Commoners, al|though hee put himself to the hazard of losing both life and fortune, in regard hee bare the Office of <HI>Lord High Constable, Captain General,</HI> and the second person of the Kingdom next his Majestie.

<P>YOur Letter I received by <HI>Pedro de Velasco.</HI> And my opinion is, since his Majestie from the place where hee is doth what hee can, to give you his power and Revenue here, That you determine to preserv it. For if hee lose his right, no wonder if you, and all those, that have done what they were obliged to do, bee dispossest of your's; But if you maintain his interest, you and his other Servants will bee all secured. That which (in my judgment) your Lordship and the Lord Admiral are now to do, is to raise men and monie with all possible expe|dition and trie your fortunes. I write to <HI>Pedro de Melgosa</HI> to use all means and shifts, that may bee, to procure you monie. The greater the danger, more glorious is the attempt.

<PB N="207" REF="109">
Ordinances, which with incessant labor and watching, the Holie <HI>Iunta</HI> had agreed to publish and dispers through the whole Kingdom, whereby they hoped to make that Repub|lick flourish, as one of the most happie and best governed in the whole world. The people were big with glorious hopes of injoying a second golden Age; and those of the <HI>Iunta</HI> were so well pleased with the thanks and applaus of the People, that their Ordinances beeing finished; they resolved to send them to the Emperor, by two Gentlemen and a Frier, not doubting but therefore his Majestie would confer som hono|rable dignities upon them. But what these were, I will not mention, onely I may say, that hee was so incensed at their message, that they held it a great mercie they escaped with their lives. They wrote moreover a kinde of requisitorie let|ter for the Cities and Towns where their Embassadors were to pass, and therein they inclosed their Letters to the Empe|ror, with the Articles and Ordinances, which in the name of the Kingdom, they desired his Majestie to confirm; and though already I have declared the substance thereof, I will set them down in the same form they sent them; that the cu|rious and patient may read and see the pretensions of the Commonalties, and what the Kingdom demanded. Let eve|ry one judg what reason they had, for my own part, I will neither excuse nor condemn them, but onely relate faithfully the truth, which is as much as can bee required of mee, con|sidering my office. In their Letters to the Emperor, they give his Maj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">stie an account of all the troubles and insurrections of the Kingdom, which they told him, proceeded from the evil Counsel which his Majestie entertained about his Roial Per|son, who, for their disordinate Covetousness, private passions and interests, besides other sinister ends (they said) might more properly bee styled the Deceivers, Cheaters, and Enemies of his Majestie's Kingdoms, and the publick good thereof, then Counsellors, such as they ought to bee. For they were the oc|casion that the Kingdom of <HI>Castilla,</HI> which abounded in riches, and all other things that could bee required of the most opu|lent
<PB N="208" REF="110">
and flourishing Kingdoms of the World, was now bee|com the poorest and most miserable of all the neighboring Kingdoms: Which did not onely concern the publick, but was also particularly prejudicial to his Majestie's Roial Patri|monie, and which was insufferable, That the desolation of his Majestie's Kingdoms, and the exhausting of his treasure, to his own exceeding inconvenience, and the ruine of his sub|jects, was to no other purpose, then to enrich his evil Coun|sellors, and divers other persons strangers, who bare no af|fection to his Majestie, nor had any zeal to advance his service, or the publick good, but to build their own fortunes. Next they complained that the Commissioners of several Cities (who desired his Majestie in the name of the Kingdom, at <HI>Santjago</HI> and the <HI>Groyn,</HI> not to demand any Subsidies) were by his Counsel sentenced rather worthie of punishment then au|dience, and order given, that they should not bee admitted to sit in Parlament, but bee confined and banished, som of them to the remotest parts of the Kingdom. That since his Maje|stie's departure out of the Kingdom, the Cardinal, with the President, and rest of the Council, had given Commissions to <HI>Antonio de Fonseca,</HI> and the <HI>Alcalde Ronquillo,</HI> to sack and make de|solate the Citie of <HI>Segovia,</HI> notwithstanding they sent to excuse and submit themselvs to the Council, and that becaus of their so rigorous proceeding, they sent to <HI>Toledo,</HI> and other Cities, for assistance, who before they raised any forces to succour them, desired the Cardinal and Council by waie of Petition to deal more favorably with those of <HI>Segovia,</HI> but receiving no satis|factorie answer, they sent an Armie into the field. They ag|gravated the crueltie of <HI>Antonio de Fonseca</HI> in burning <HI>Medina,</HI> whereby the Town was endammaged above two millions of Ducates, and which occasioned the rising of divers other places. They declared how the Queen had commanded the <HI>Iunta</HI> to remove from <HI>Avila</HI> to <HI>Tordesillas.</HI> That they had un|dertaken the care of the Queen's person, and put the Marquis of <HI>Denia</HI> and his Ladie from her, holding them destructive to the advancement of the publick good. They alleged reasons
<PB N="209" REF="110">
for dissolving the Council, which his Majestie had settled be|fore his departure. And why they paied their Armie out of his Majestie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s Revenues. At last they desired his Majestie would bee pleased to grant and confirm all those Articles, which their Embassadors should present him from the King|dom, the intent and scope of them beeing meerly for his good, and the peaceable Government, by regulating and repairing the miseries and great dammages that had been occasioned through the evil Counsel of those, which thitherto had abused and mis-led his Majest<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e; urging moreover, that for the be|nefit of the Publick, and the improving of his Roial Patrimo|nie, it was necessarie and expedient, that until such time as his Majestie should appoint other persons of better temper, and uprighter intentions to reside in his High Council then the former were, his Majestie should give power to those Cities and Towns, which had Vote in Parlament, to provide and see to the Administration of Justice, and other things wherein those of his Council ought to have been more circumspect and moderate. And also, that hee would revoke the Com|missions and Autoritie which hee had sent to the, then ruling, Governors, becaus they were men whom the Kingdom could not endure. Besides this letter to the Emperor, they sent another to those of the Citie where hee then was, desiring them to join with them in supplication to his Majestie, and procure his consent and approbation of all the Kingdom's de|sires, in regard they tended to his Majestie's service, the pub|lick good of the Kingdom, the increasing of his Roial Patri|monie, and were exceedingly conducing to a peaceable and quiet government.

<HEAD>MOST HIGH AND MIGHTIE CATHO|LICK PRINCES, QUEEN AND KING OUR SOVEREIGNS, That which the Cities, Towns, Villages, Commonalties, and Natives of your Kingdom of <HI>Castilla</HI> and <HI>Leon,</HI> do desires your Majesties will bee pleased to grant for a perpe|tual Law, is here ensuing: That which concern's his MAIESTIES ROIAL PERSON.</HEAD>

staying here your Majestie may give Laws and Command over the whole World, as your Predecessors have done: And nothing of all that which they desire of your Majestie will bee so pleasing to these Kingdoms (although you should grant them much more, for they hope your Majestie will condescend to all these things) then your speedie coming to them. For it is not the custom of <HI>Castilla,</HI> to bee without their King, neither can they b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e governed by others in peace and quiet, which is very necessarie for your Royal service.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> These Kingdoms humbly beseech your Majestie at your return, to bee pleased to marrie, it beeing necessarie for the universal good of these Kingdoms, that there should bee some issue to succeed your Royal Person, as they desire, your Majestie's age now requiring it. And that you would bee pleased to take a wife according to the Vote and good l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">king of these your Kingdoms, for so shee shall bee of some Countrie in amitie with them, as is most convenient for your service and the contentment of your Royal Person.</P>

<HEAD>That which concern's the Royal Familie.</HEAD>
<P>THat our Ladie and Sovereign the Queen's Royal hous bee put in such order and estate, as is becoming her Royal Person, and the honor of these Kingdoms. That the Officers about her bee persons of qualitie. That her hous bee sufficiently provided of all thing befitting her dignitie, for so her Highn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ss will bee well pleased with these Kingdoms, and they obliged.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> That his Majestie would bee pleased at his return into these Kingdoms, to bring neither <HI>Flemings, French,</HI> nor other strangers whatso&euml;ver, to bear any Office in his Royal Familie. But that hee would confer all such Offices upon Natives of these Kingdoms, there beeing multitudes of able and sufficient persons, who will serv his Majestie with much affection and loyaltie, and that his heirs and successors for ever should continue the like order.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> That neither his Majestie, nor his successors, bring in,
<PB N="212" REF="112">
or entertain any forreign souldiers for the guard of their Per|sons or defens of their Kingdoms, in regard there are war-like and courageous men enough amongst the Natives, not onely to defend their own Countrie, but to conquer others, as they had done heretofore.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> That his Majestie beeing in these Kingdoms, and having none but Natives about him, would bee pleased to order his Familie in all respects as <HI>Don Fernando,</HI> his grandfather, and <HI>Donia Isabel</HI> his Queen, and the rest of the Catholick King's, his Progenitors of glorious memorie, had done before him. For in so doing hee would save a number of unneces|sarie expences which were made in his table and houshold; and this would palpably appear, for his Majestie will find that in the dishes for his own table, and those that are made for the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vorites and great persons of his familie, is daiely spent one hundred and fiftie thousand <HI>Maravediz,</HI> and that the table-expences of <HI>Don Fernando</HI> the King and <HI>Donia Isabel</HI> (who were excellent and powerfull Princes) besides the Prince <HI>Don Iohn</HI> (whom God receiv in his glorie) and the <HI>Infantes,</HI> with a multitude of attendants, amounted to no more then twelv or fifteen thousand <HI>Maravediz, per diem.</HI> And hence proceed's his Majestie's wants, and the impoverishing of the People and Commonalties, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ubsidies and other taxes im|posed upon them.</P>

But if any man should die in his Majestie's service, in satisfaction or equivalence thereof, hee might allow a pension or stipend to the wife or children of the deceased, although they bee not of age to serv.</P>

<P><HI>Item,</HI> That in his Majestie's houshold no Grandee might have any office concerning the Revenue or Royal Patrimonie, and if any enjoy any such office at present, that it maie bee taken from them.

<P><HI>Item,</HI> that the Provisions, Orders or Commissions which his Majestie had given in those Kingdoms, contrarie to the above specified form, might be declared void, and that hee would command those and every of those Governors, whom hee had autorized, to forbear the execution of that office.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> that the Governor or Governors, beeing constituted in the abovesaid manner and form, may bee invested with power to confer dignities, offices, administration of Justice,

<P>THe lodging by Billets (which is practised no where neither amongst Infidels nor Christians, but in this Kingdom) beeing a thing most exorbitant, and whence have proceeded and do proceed inconveniences and dam|mages so excessive, that a small volume cannot contain them, and his Majestie's subjects suffer thereby not a little, aswell in their honors and lives, as in their estates, <HI>That</HI> for ever henceforth they may bee freed from so abominable and pre|judicial a servitude.

<P><HI>Item,</HI> That these lodgings which are allowed for his Ma|jestie's familie, are not intended for those of the Council, for the <HI>Alcaldes</HI> of his hous and Court, nor the <HI>Alguaziles,</HI> or other Judges or Officers whatso&euml;ver, nor the High Treasurers, or any such like, for these are to paie for their lodgings, by the order and form before mentioned.</P>

<P>THat the Customs and Thirds which belong to the Crown, may bee reduced to the same number and quantitie as they were instituted by the Catholick King <HI>Don Fernando</HI> and <HI>Donia Isabel, Anno</HI> 1494. That at the same rates and value all the Cities, Towns, Villages, with their several Lordships and Leases of Abbie-lands, may remain taxed for

Those of the <HI>Iunta</HI> answered, That they knew very well, that his Lordship came to speak with them concerning the Commonalties of the Kingdoms, but they desired him not to put himself to the trouble of coming thither, until he had dismissed those Gentlemen, with their sou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|diers, out of <HI>Medina,</HI> and his own lands, &amp; those of the Council likewise, in regard they disserved his Majestie, and hindred the good of the Kingdom, which don, they should be very glad to serv him, and shew him all the respects due to his person. The Admiral replied, that hee was well contented to discharge all those souldiers, and send away all those of the Council, except the Cardinal and the Lord High Constable of <HI>Castilla,</HI> who were the Governors and principal men of the Kingdoms: Those of the <HI>Iunta</HI> would not bee satisfied, unless they were all sent away. Whereupon they sent two Heralds with a Nota|rie publick, to require him with great protestations, that hee should not permit the mischiefs and dammages which might bee occasioned by the <HI>Iunta,</HI> and the Armies of the Advers Partie. They sent others also with trumpets, to require the Lord High Constable, and the Earl of <HI>Alva,</HI> not to levie anie Souldiers, becaus that would bee prejudicial to the Roial Crown, and hurtful to the Kingdoms. The Lord High Constable received those that brought him this message very courteously, and commanded a dinner to bee prepared for

them; After which, hee sent them to the Earl of <HI>Alva,</HI> with twelv of his own men on hors-back. The Earl apprehended the chief man of them, commanding him to bee clapt in pri|son, and afterwards, they saie, hee caused him to bee stran|gled, and gave no other Answer to the <HI>Iunta</HI>: whereat they were very much displeas'd; others said, The Earl did like a wor|thie Gentleman, for no Law or Word is to be observ'd or kept with Traitors.

That they had made a new Broad-Seal, contrarie to the Laws of the Kingdom, wherewith they did seal Orders against his Maje|sties Subjects, and contrarie to all right and Justice. That they did favor and uphold those of the evil Counsel; and that they had apprehended her Majesties Chamberlain, all which was in dis-respect or contempt of her Majestie, and to the pre|judice of the publick good.

<P>I Mentioned in the rising of <HI>Burgos,</HI> the prudence and courage which the Lord high Counstable, to detain and suppress the furie of that disorderly people, had shewed, in taking upon himself the Autoritie and care of administring Justice, to the great contentment and rejoicing of the Citizens. But the inconstant Vulgar, upon no occasion, lost the respect which was due to so honorable a person, never considering how advantageous it would have been for them to have suff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|red themselvs to bee governed by him in such troublesom times. That which they pretended to bee the caus of their respectless audacitie was, That when <HI>Medina del Campo</HI> did be|siege <HI>Alaejos, Segovia, Salamanca, Avila,</HI> and other Cities, having assisted them with men to destroie that Town, out of the ex|ceeding hatred which they bore <HI>Antonio de Fonseca: Burgos</HI> would do the like out of revenge of the Merchandise which they lost in <HI>Medina,</HI> by <HI>Antonio de Fonseca</HI>'s burning it: But the Lord High Constable satisfied them otherwise; And becaus his son offered himself to bee their Captain, which the people imagined hee did onely out of subtiltie and cun|ning to amuse them or for som other by-respect, they began to bee jealous of him; this suspicion ingendred a mortal hatred, insomuch that their furie grew beyond the bounds of moderation and obedience. The Lord high Counstable had privately conveyed into his hous four hundred Lances: Which beeing known in the Citie, the <HI>Regidores</HI> and Gentle|men assembled, and sent two of their companie to summon him. Hee excused himself, saying, hee was very ill, and could not go to them: But they told him, that they could not bee satisfied with that answer, hee must rise, and go with them. At last hee went, and was civilly received; beeing com amongst them, two of the Assemblie in the names of all the
<PB N="248" REF="130">
rest, rose up and thus bespake him; Wee are very sorrie and grieved that the honor and affection wherewith this Citie hath alwaies served your Lordship and your Ancestors (bee|ing Persons of so great qualitie, natives, and in a maner, Lords of all this Citie, which is the chief of <HI>Castilla</HI>) should bee so ill requited, as that you should keep secretly in your hous four hundred Lances, to destroie the people: wee require you forthwith to dismiss them, and reserv onely twentie servants about you, if not, the Citie will take their remedie. This was not very pleasing to the Lord Constable, but it behoved him to satisfie their desires. Yet notwithstanding hee condescen|ded to their wills,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Burgos</HI> riseth up in Arms a|gainst the Lord High Constable.</NOTE> the suspicions ceased not, neither were the people pacified. Upon our Ladie's daie of September their furie broke out, and all the Commonaltie rose up in Arms against him, in such a raging manner that they had killed him, if hee had not retired to his hous, where almost two whole daies they kept him besieged, and <HI>Don Diego Sarmiento</HI> the Earl of <HI>Salinas</HI> with the Dutchess and the Countess their wives. After this, seeing himself the object of the people's malice, and every hour in danger to lose his life; hee con|ditioned with the people to let him go freely with all his familie out of the Citie; Which beeing granted, hee went to a Town of his called <HI>Briviesca.</HI> This example of the Peo|ple of <HI>Burgos,</HI> made other places commit the like audacities against their Lords; as <HI>Haro</HI> against the Earl of <HI>Haro,</HI> Son to the Lord high Constable; <HI>Duenias</HI> against the Earl of <HI>Buendia</HI>; and also <HI>Naxara</HI> against the Duke; although that Citie doth allege and prove that they rose not for the Com|monaltie, but for the King, whose subjects and tenants (they saie) they are. The Lord high Constable beeing at <HI>Bri|viesca,</HI> very full of care and sorrow to see the Kingdom in so great distempers, and so little probabilitie of any remedie; about the middle of September arrived <HI>Lope Hurtado de Mendo&ccedil;a</HI> with dispatches and orders from the Emperor, im|porting that hee should bee Governor of <HI>Castilla</HI> and <HI>Navarra</HI> joyntly with the Cardinal and the Admiral of <HI>Castilla</HI>; Which
<PB N="249" REF="130">
having read, hee presently accepted the Government of the Kingdoms: But becaus the Commission was for them all three, hee could not so suddenly execute the Command. For the Cardinal was as yet at <HI>Valladolid,</HI> and the Admiral in <HI>Cata|lunia,</HI> in the Countie of <HI>Cabra,</HI> whither the dispatches were sent to him, who was of opinion to defer the acceptance of that Charge, until his return into <HI>Castilla,</HI> and to use som means in the <HI>interim</HI> to agree and accommodate the differences of the Commonalties, as you have already heard. Which difficul|tie beeing related to the Emperor, beeing on the waie to <HI>Aquis|gran,</HI> where hee was Crowned; hee sent other Letters dated the 17 <HI>October</HI> following, with special command to the Lord High Constable, that having assembled som of the Coun|cil, hee should, alone with them, execute the charge of Gover|nor of the Kingdoms, &amp; provide for the remedying of the pre|sent disorders, until such time as the Cardinal, and the Admiral could com to join with him; which hee did, as shall appear hereafter.</P>

<P>THe Lord High Constable seeing the remedie of the Kingdoms to lie upon his account (although hee was much offended with those of <HI>Burgos</HI>) without seeking any reparation of honor, prudently endeavored by fair means and treatments full of courtesie, to appeas that people, and reduce them into the Roial waie of doing their Prince service; for it was of no small importance for him, at the beginning of his Government, to gain that Citie, and settle himself in it, bee|ing the chief of <HI>Castilla,</HI> and a place of such greatness and esteem. Hee kept intelligence with som principal Gentlemen of <HI>Burgos,</HI> by whose industrie the Citie was so well disposed and ordered, that within a short time after, hee became ma|ster of it; This was the first symptom of the Countrie's

The Lord Admiral, having intelligence of all that passed in <HI>Valladolid,</HI> wrote them a Letter, saying, That although hee did not desire to bee pe|stered with those troubles and confusions, yet his coming thi|ther should not bee deferred much longer. <HI>That</HI> his intention was to do good to them all generally, being very much grieved for what had passed amongst them. <HI>That</HI> he could not choos but admire at the tumultuous risings of the Kingdom. <HI>That</HI> if they had but written twice or thrice to his Majestie, he would have remedied all those disorders, by granting what they desir'd. <HI>That</HI> their keeping Guards, and going their Rounds about the Citie, tended to nothing but the consuming of their Estates, destroy|ing of their Trade, the undoing of the Husbandmen and Com|mon People, for which hee was very sorrie. <HI>That</HI> the whole world took notice heretofore of the nobleness and loialtie of these Kingdoms: And now their inconstancie, divisions, and factious insurrections, afforded matter of discours to all other Nations. <HI>That</HI> they should take notice that the great Turk was com with a mightie Armie against <HI>Rodes,</HI> ravaging and spoiling Christendom both by Sea and Land, and that by rea|son of these dissentions, animosities, and confusion amongst
<PB N="257" REF="134">
the people, it were no hard matter for him to gain footing in these Kingdoms. Therefore hee affectionately desired them all to bee pacified, and to believ, that his Majestie was very much troubled and aggrieved at these sad occurrences: And that at his return hee would procure the good of the King|doms. This Letter beeing read in the publick Assemblie of <HI>Valladolid,</HI> did sufficiently startle som of them, but they hoped for a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">emedie from heaven. After this the Lord Admiral bee|ing at <HI>Zerbera,</HI> wrote another Letter to them in a manner to the same effect. Which beeing heard and seen by those of <HI>Valladolid,</HI> t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ey were astonished at the words and counsel wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch hee gave them therein, not knowing how to answer his reasons, nor to what they should attribute his counsels. Som that were of opinion that the <HI>Iunta</HI> was wicked and un|lawful, would have it bee dissolved; others extolling it to the skie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, urged, that every bodie ought to conform themselvs thereunto. The Nobles and Gentrie at <HI>Rioseco</HI> were very de|sirous to re-unite and pacifie <HI>Valladolid,</HI> it beeing so conside|rable a place, thinking besides, that if they were but Masters thereof, they should with more facilitie compass their design upon the other Cities: To this effect they used all the po|licie and subtil inventions possible, sending messengers, and holding private intelligence with those of the Citie, who were well affected and desired the King's service. The Citie was in this season more strictly watched then before, they making secret Rounds, and placing strong Guards at all the Gates; for the contrarie parti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> (which was the most powerful) was jea|lous, and afraid of som double dealing.</P>

<P>AT the same time that <HI>Valladolid</HI> received the Lord Admi|ral's Letters, others were brought to them from <HI>Burgos,</HI> which were likewise read in the publick Assemblie of the

The Reader may imagine what various humors, what speeches, what factions, what passions were engendred, by the Contents of those Letters; finally, what confusion they might breed in so noble and spatious a Citie, (the seat of the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI>) and what judgments and censures might there-hence take their rise, and fill the malicious heads of the Common people; not knowing well which hand they had best to use, they resolved to plaie with both, and sent again to the Cardinal, Governor, and those of the <HI>Junta</HI> also, their Embassadors <HI>Don Pedro Va&ccedil;an,</HI> and the others before men|tioned, with certain Articles which they thought were con|venient for the pacification of the Kingdoms, The Cardi|nal with those of the Council, gave them a fair reception, and a satisfactorie answer: Those of the <HI>Junta</HI> did no less, desiring to make them of their pack, and moreover, they wrote a Letter to those of the Commonaltie in <HI>Valladolid,</HI> with some expressions of zeal and affection mingled with re|prehensions for their luke-warmness and indifferencie.</P>

<P>ON Sundaie the eleventh of <HI>October,</HI> one <HI>Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nso de Vera</HI> got up into the Pulpit of the Cathedral Church of <HI>Valladolid,</HI> and read to the people two Letters, one from those of the <HI>Iunta,</HI> wherein they desired, that <HI>Valladolid</HI> would assist and stand to them, as they had promissed, and fulfil what they had commanded them. The other was from <HI>Don Pedro Giron,</HI> in which hee offered them his service, desiring that as hee had alwaies shewed a particular affection to that Citie, and been tender of their welfare, they would receiv him, in regard hee was Captain General of the <HI>Junta's</HI> forces, and de|sired nothing but the good of the Kingdom, and his Majestie's service, neither would hee act any thing but with the good liking and consent of <HI>Valladolid.</HI> The people were ex|ceedingly
<PB N="259" REF="135">
taken with these Letters, and said, they would do whatsoever therein was required, and that <HI>Don Pedro</HI> should bee welcom into the Citie; And the next daie hee made his entrie, all the people of <HI>Valladolid</HI> going forth to receiv him with great applause. This War beeing betwixt kindred, friends, and Countrie men, there was as much diligence used to gain places, and good wills, by Letters, as by force of Arms. The Earl of <HI>Venavente,</HI> and the Lord Admiral of <HI>Castilla</HI> were in a manner Natives and Citizens of <HI>Valladolid,</HI> their families from many generations, having had their principal mansions there, and the Citie bare them great respect, as they had reason. These Noble-men shewing their affection to <HI>Valladolid,</HI> as their Native soil, and seeing it so far plunged in these distra|ctions, either out of hope to reduce it by fair means, or meerly out of their love and desire of its good and preservation, they both endeavored by Letters to make them sensible of their errors. The Lord Admiral chiefly desired, <HI>that</HI> they would let him com into their Citie, promising, <HI>that</HI> hee would bee as vigilant and careful of their general good, as of any particular persons&punc; <HI>That</HI> hee would imploy in their defens his own life, and fortune: If that could not bee granted, <HI>that</HI> they would send any three, whom they thought fittest, to meet and confer with him, two or three leagues thence, where they pleased. But <HI>Valladolid</HI> would accept of none of these con|ditions, alledging that such enter-views would bee ill taken, and that people would bee apt thereupon to saie, <HI>Burgos</HI> ha|ving Articled and agreed with the Lord high Constable, that <HI>Valladolid</HI> would do the lik<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. So they returned the Lord Ad|miral no other Answer, then that for the present they could not condescend to any of those things which his Lordship desired. To the Earl of <HI>Venavente's</HI> Letter they briefly thus re|plied, That since his Lordship was so Noble, as to offer them his own person, and men, they desired that hee would keep his promise, in letting them have the said men to send to <HI>Tor|desillas,</HI> in the <HI>Iunta</HI>'s service, and upon that condition, they should carrie the Colours and Arms of <HI>Valladolid.</HI> These
<PB N="260" REF="136">
Letters were dispatched in the name of the Citie by the Prior of the great Church, who was a grand Commoner. These answers beeing sent to the two Noble-men, the Citie gave order for the raising of more men to send to the <HI>Iunta,</HI> becaus there were many wanting of the thousand which they had sent. Moreover, Command was given for the gathering of one hundred Duckets out of every Ward, which amounted to one thousand four hundred Duckets. Which was forth|with done, and the thousand men compleated. After this they caused a Proclamation to bee made throughout the Citie, commanding all and everie of the Commonaltie to appear un|der pain of beeing accused for Malignants, or Ill-affected to the <HI>Iunta.</HI> Who beeing all assembled, they made them swear by the Holie Evangelists, and upon the Cross <HI>in forma, that</HI> under pain of beeing infamous perjurers and faith-breakers, they should bee readie to serv, favor, and assist in whatsoever those of the <HI>Iunta</HI> should do, in order to the ser|vice of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Engage|ment of those of <HI>Valladolid.</HI></NOTE> the King, Queen, and Commonaltie of the Citie of <HI>Valladolid</HI>; and <HI>that</HI> they should not do, or saie, directly or indirectly, any thing to the contrarie, or suffer anie thing to bee said or done by their children, servants, or housholds. <HI>And</HI> if they should know or hear any thing said or done to the con|trarie, <HI>that</HI> they should forthwith inform the Assemblie of the Citie of <HI>Valladolid</HI> thereof, to the end the offenders might re|ceiv condigne punishment; The Oath beeing thus pro|nounced, they all cried with one voice, This wee swear.</P>

<P>I Have already declared, how the Citie of <HI>Segovia</HI> was divi|ded by several factions, insomuch that they seemed to bee in Civil War amongst themselvs. The Earl of <HI>Chinchon</HI> defen|ded the Forts.

<PB N="261" REF="136">
others did the like in the Cathedral Church. The Fort bee|ing but slenderly mann'd, the Earl of <HI>Chinchon</HI> went to <HI>Burgos,</HI> to desire succour from the Lord High Constable, who sent ten Musketiers, valiant and resolute men, with order to get into the Fort, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s they could.

<P>_THe Passions of the people in <HI>Castilla</HI> grew to such mortal animosities, that pens and tongues beeing wearied, they fell to pre|paring arms and munition of war: as when an Impostume fester's, no cure can bee exspected, but by the applying of hot burning Iron. Those Gentlemen who were the chief sticklers for the Commonalties, beeing lanch'd forth into the deepest of the sea of passion, knowing how ill a name they had acquired (which exceedingly offended their
<PB N="263" REF="137">
presumption,) were already grown so desperate, that they cared not to lose their Countries, Estates, Wives, Children, or their own Lives, desiring to hazard all in the Lotterie of Arms, and make or destroie their fortunes in one Battle; wherein, if their designs had been crowned with success, doubtless, they would have changed their styles, and beeing victorious, remained with the glorious attribute of Redeem|ers and Defenders of their Countrie: for humane judgments determine by the Event, not by the middle or beginning of any Enterprise. Though it hath been the ordinarie defect of other Commonalties to have but slender forces, this was so powerful,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Cap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ns were good e|nou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h, if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hey had not h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d som <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eache<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+rous great ones amongst them.</NOTE> that had there been the least good Conduct <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mongst them, and som experienced Captains, <HI>Don Carlos</HI> hardly ever would have recovered the Crown of <HI>Spain.</HI> The Common people were to blame, and the Gentrie not to bee excused, for opposing and rising against their Sovereign's Ministers; yet wee must of necessitie confess, that they were valiant. That there were divers exorbitancies, outrages, and insolencies com|mitted, What wonder is it amongst the respectless and liber|tine People? and that the Gentlemen depended more upon them, then they upon the Nobles, who assisted them. If wee see an Armie well disciplined, the Souldiers subject and obe|dient to their Captains, shall wee saie absolutely all those in that Armie are Traitors? for my part I would not; neither is it any such great marvel that children rise up against their own fathers;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Here the Au|tor con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">leth in a manner the justnes, of the Caus, and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">emeth him|self to justifie it.</NOTE> for if wee look back to som passages of our Coun|trie of <HI>Spain,</HI> what shall wee see, but the like unnatural acti|ons; the factions of Princes, the sidings of Grandees, and private Gentlemen, who were so audacious, as to rise in arms, against their lawful Kings? and yet they are not so spotted and foul as som would make those of the latter times appear to bee. I do not saie this in justification of these Commonalties, but onely to excuse, in what I may, my own Nation, and the Gentrie thereof. But to return to the purpose: Nothing was left unattempted on either side, that might conduce to the increasing or securitie of their Partie. You have seen in the
<PB N="264" REF="138">
precedent Book, that the <HI>Iunta</HI> sent their Instructions to <HI>Val|ladolid,</HI> where <HI>Don Pedro Giron,</HI> and other Captains of the Commonaltie, were assembled. The time beeing com (al|though the season was very sharp and unfit for an Armie to keep the field, beeing almost in the depth of Winter) they all put themselvs in a readiness, and in the name of the <HI>Iunta,</HI> they wrote fresh Letters to the Cities and Towns of their Combi|nation, to send immediately all the forces they could possibly rais; which they did. Those of the <HI>Iunta,</HI> according to agreement, Voted <HI>Don Pedro Giron</HI> Captain General of their Forces, and sent him a Commission from the Queen, and the Kingdom, Thinking that hee beeing a person of so noble ex|traction, and allied to so many Grandees of <HI>Castilla,</HI> would gain a great reputation to their Partie; And most men were of opinion, that <HI>Don Pedro Giron</HI> accepted thereof, and wed|ded the Interest of the Commonaltie meerly for his own ends, and that by means of these troubles and commotions, hee might get possession of the Dukedom of <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dina Sidonia,</HI> which (as hath been already said) hee pretended was his right. This Election did not digest well in <HI>Iohn de Padilla</HI>'s stomach, who, till then, had executed the office of Captain General, and presumed it should bee confirmed upon him, and for his sake, neither the Commissioners of <HI>Toledo,</HI> nor of <HI>Madrid,</HI> would give their Votes for <HI>Don Pedro. Iohn de Pa|dilla</HI> beeing informed of all these passages, before that <HI>Don Pe|dro Giron</HI> came to take his staff, pretending I know not what occasion, rode poste to <HI>Toledo</HI>; and his men, seeing their Cap|tain gone, would staie no longer in the Armie, but the next daie took the same waie after him. Notwithstanding all this, <HI>Don Pedro Giron</HI> accepted the Charge, and came to <HI>Torde|sillas</HI> with fourscore Lances of his own, appointed a <HI>Rande|vous</HI> for his Armie, wherein hee was much assisted by the in|dustrie and diligence of the Bishop of <HI>Zamora,</HI> who brought to the service of the <HI>Iunta</HI> near five hundred men with arms, of the antient Guards of the Kingdom, (for the rest were gone to the Lord High Constable) hee brought
<PB N="265" REF="138">
moreover, seventie Lances of his own, and almost a thou|sand Foot, four hundred whereof were Priests of his own Bishoprick, besides the people of <HI>Zamora,</HI> whom hee had at his devotion; for by favor of the <HI>Junta,</HI> hee had driven the Earl of <HI>Alva</HI> out of <HI>Zamora,</HI> and made himself Master thereof. Every daie came fresh supplies from the other Cities, both of Hors and Foot, all well armed, and with them som Gentle|men and Commanders. From <HI>Salamanca</HI> came <HI>Don Pedro Maldonado,</HI> with about a thousand Foot: Other Cities appoin|ted those who were their Commissioners in the <HI>Junta</HI> to bee their Captains; As <HI>Leon</HI> chose <HI>Gonsalo de Guzman,</HI> son to <HI>Ra|miro Nun~ez</HI>; and the Citie of <HI>Toro, Don Hernando de Ulloa,</HI> who were their Commissioners; and so likewise did other places. Thus those of the <HI>Junta</HI> grew from daie to daie more powerful, beeing resolved to end the business by force of Arms. Their mouths were all filled with reproachful and threatning language, especially the Common-people's, who cal|led the Grandees and Gentrie of the Countrie, Traitors &amp; ene|mies of the Kingdom, saying, they had destroied &amp; taken away their estates; (w^c^h availed them nothing) but who can restrein a multitude? Amongst other impertinencies, they said, That the Queen should do well to marrie the Duke of <HI>Calabria, Don Her|nando de Aragon,</HI> son to <HI>Frederick</HI> last K. of <HI>Naples,</HI> who, since the time of the Catholick King, had been kept prisoner in <HI>Xativa,</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Valencia</HI>; I believ this was onely put up|on those of the <HI>Junta,</HI> and that they neither did, nor thought any such thing. But the truth is, their passion was grown to such an height, that they never so much as named the Empe|ror in their Proclamations, though they had sworn Allegi|ance to him, as their King, but all passed in the names of the Queen and Kingdom: Insomuch that the hatred and enmi|tie betwixt the two parties became implacable, and both made all preparations possible for a war. In short time those of the <HI>Junta</HI> had put their forces in a readiness, and equipage to march unto the field, as was determined.</P>

Hee expressed much gladness to see so many gallant men, and persons of such eminent qualitie: Y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t hee had no intention, to wade through blood to the ac|complishment of his desires, but rather by fair means, if possible, to settle the disturbed State of the Kingdoms; which to effect, hee left no stone unturn'd, and at last hee obtained, that three or four of the Commissioners of the <HI>Iunta</HI> should give him a meeting at <HI>Torrelobaton,</HI> where they consumed five or six daies in treating, but all his reasons, persuasions, and fair promisses could bring them to no reason: Before they would harken to any proposition of his, they demanded that the Lord high Constable should renounce, and leav off the exercise of Vice-Roy and Governor, which hee had begun to execute; And whilest the Lord Admiral was thus treating with them, the <HI>Iunta</HI> commanded a Proclamation to bee made against the Lord high Constable, and the Earl of <HI>Alva de Lista,</HI> as is before mentioned, and other Noble-men: And <HI>Don Pedro Giron,</HI> with the Bishop of <HI>Zamora,</HI> had orders to draw their Armie into the field, which was seaventeen thou|sand Foot, besides good store of hors, and much Artillerie, which had been brought from <HI>Medina del Campo.</HI> Where|upon the Lord Admiral despairing of any Peace, protested against them, and returned to <HI>Rioseco,</HI> beeing resolved to ac|cept the Government joyntly with the Cardinal and the Lord high Constable, in regard those fair conditions of agreement, which hee offred, were slighted and rejected. <HI>Don Pedro Giron,</HI> Captain-General for the <HI>Iunta,</HI> and the Bishop of

And indeed, if the Commoners had been men at that time, they might have done it. From their head-quarters at <HI>Villabraxima,</HI> they wrote to the Citie of <HI>Valladolid,</HI> giving them an account of their advance, and that, before they fell upon <HI>Rioseco,</HI> they would send a King at Arms to require the Lord Admiral, and those of the Town of <HI>Rioseco,</HI> to cast out those thievs, and destroyers of the Kingdom, (as they called the <HI>Cavaliers</HI>); if not that they would use means to take them, and hinder the Cardinal's Government, it beeing a thing contrarie to the Laws, and Rights of the Kingdom.</P>

Thus the two Armies faced one another, each watching an opportunitie to get the advantage of their enemies, and so they remained both drawn up in <HI>Batalia</HI> one whole daie, after which, the <HI>Cavaliers</HI> retreated to <HI>Tordehumos,</HI> and the <HI>Iunta's</HI> Armie to <HI>Villabraxima,</HI> both neer <HI>Rioseco.</HI> The four hundred Priests, which had left their Altars, in Imitation of the Bishop of <HI>Zamora,</HI> to sacrifice their bloods in this Holie enterprise, remained at <HI>Tordesillas,</HI> for the guard of the Town and of the <HI>Iunta,</HI> who out of respect to their Sacer|dotal Dignities, would not permit them to march amongst the rabble of the Common Souldiers.

To this effect, having m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">de a general muster, they marched with all their Artillerie in very good order towards <HI>Rioseco.

At last, <HI>Don Pedro Giron,</HI> having commanded som of his Cannon to bee discharged against the Town, (but the bullets never reach't the Walls) returned with his Armie into his Quarters, losing and neglecting that occasion, which pro|ved very prejudicial to his Partie.

Insomuch that hereby they held themselvs stronger then their enemies; not that they exceeded them in number, but in virtue and courage, besides the Caus which they mainteined was more just, and warran|table, which add's much confidence and boldness to the hearts of men, and make's their souls insusceptible of any Panick fears.</P>

<P>UPon the agreement between the Lord Admiral, the Earl of <HI>Venavente,</HI> and <HI>Don Pedro Giron,</HI> the Armie without know|ing any reason wherefore, marched from <HI>Tordehumos</HI> and <HI>Villa|braxima</HI> to <HI>Villalpando,</HI> where, after some small resistance, they were received and quartered peaceably. <HI>Don Pedro Giron</HI> took up his lodging, in his unkle, the Lord high Constable's hous. All were of opinion that <HI>Don Pedro</HI> juggled, and plaied legerdemain in this business, and so it appeared by his dislodging his Armie, and leaving the enemie free, besides having nothing at all to do at <HI>Villalpando.</HI> And indeed <HI>Don Pedro Giron</HI> might well bee suspected herein, for the Grandees, who were his neer kindred, wrought much upon him, as shall bee seen hereafter. The <HI>Cavaliers</HI> see|ing
<PB N="276" REF="144">
themselvs free from the incumbrance of that powerful Armie, which blocked them up in a manner, and finding the waie cleer and secure from thence to <HI>Tordesillas,</HI> marched all out of <HI>Rioseco,</HI> seizing on all Posts and Travellers, that might give notice of their approach, making as if they had a design upon <HI>Valladolid,</HI> but with as much speed as an Armie could advance, they went directly to <HI>Tordesillas</HI>; Those of the <HI>Iunta,</HI> hearing of their coming, dispatched presently a Post to <HI>Valladolid,</HI> telling them, that the <HI>Cavaliers</HI> were marching thither with all expedi|tion, therefore they desired them to send them speedie succor. But <HI>Valladolid</HI> having sent neer four thousand of their choisest men already to the Armie, and hearing that the enemie was like to fall upon them, desired to bee excused, thinking they might better have relief from the Armie, where were men enough. But they beeing in good quarters at <HI>Villalpando,</HI> were not over|hastie to go to <HI>Tordesillas,</HI> for the plot was so well laid, that no man knew the certaintie of the design, but that which <HI>Don Pedro</HI> did a little after, confirmed the suspition the world had conceived of him. One night the <HI>Cavaliers</HI> stormed the Town, having clapt a Petar to the Gates, but finding strong resistance, the Earl of <HI>Haro</HI> sent a Trumpet, to tell them they came onely to kiss the Queen's hands, and to set her at libertie, and required them to yeild; Whereunto they giving no satisfactorie answer, the Earl resolved to force them, and encouraged his Souldiers, promising them the pillage of the Town. But what by the natural strength of the place, what through the courageous resist|ance of the besieged, the Earl lost above 250 men, before hee could make any breach. The Priests, which the Bishop of <HI>Zamora</HI> left there, behaved themselvs very valorously in this Holie caus: One amongst the rest was particularly observed to have given eleven men their <HI>Viaticum</HI> with his musket, from behinde the Battle|ments of the Wall, where hee thought hee stood secure, and as he saw occasion sent his <HI>Benediction</HI> amongst them, which seldom mist his man.

The Cavalier-Souldiers, beeing thus entred the Town, used no vio|lence to either man, woman, or childe, for that they were for|bidden; but neither Houses, Churches, nor Monasteries escaped from plundering: So that no man had so much as a bed left to sleep upon, unless the Souldiers, out of charitie, would let him have any; which punishment they did deserv, for fighting and defending their goods no better, after they were engaged, and put themselvs into a posture of resistance. The Grandees and Gentlemen, beeing entred into <HI>Tordesillas,</HI> went directly to the Palace to kiss the Queen's hands, and shew her their due re|spects, they found her with the <HI>Infanta,</HI> her daughter, <HI>Don~a Ca|talina,</HI> in her own chamber, whence <HI>Don Pedro de Ayala,</HI> Com|missioner of <HI>Toledo,</HI> had persuaded her to withdraw during the fight: Som say, to the end, that from the wall, shee might have commanded the besiegers not to storm the Town; others think, it was with intent to conveie her thence, and carrie her by the Bridg-waie to <HI>Medina del Campo</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Som of the Commissio|ners of the <HI>Iunta</HI> make their e|scapes.</NOTE> But this escape that was inten|ded for the Queen, beeing attempted just upon the entrie of the enemie into the Town, <HI>Don Pedro de Ayala</HI> left her, and fled him|self to <HI>Medina del Campo.</HI> Shee shewed the Gentlemen that came to kiss her hands very gracious countenance, though, by reason of her infirmitie and want of judgment, shee cared little how things went; onely it is reported, that while they were batter|ing the Town, som of the Commissioners beeing there, desired that shee would send a Command to the Besiegers to desist; and shee answered, Open you the gates, and let them in. The Earl of <HI>Haro</HI> staied at the gates, to see his Artillerie and Hors let in until midnight; which done, hee went likewise to kiss her Majestie's hands, where hee found the rest of the Nobles, who soon after, taking their leavs, went to take their rest; but the Earl of <HI>Haro</HI> spent all the night in placing his Guards, and taking
<PB N="278" REF="145">
order for securing of the place. Nine or ten of the Commissi|oners of the Cities were taken and imprisoned; the rest fled, som to <HI>Medina,</HI> others to <HI>Valladolid,</HI> where they arrived so man|gled and stript, that 'twas a pitie to see them.

In this manner was taken the Town of <HI>Tordesillas</HI>; but not the <HI>Iunta,</HI> nor the good will of the revolted Cities, whose furie was hereby more enflamed. A|mongst the dead in the field were found divers dangerously wounded, and som Gentlemen, as <HI>Don Diego Osorio,</HI> son to the Marquis of <HI>Astorga,</HI> who was shot through the arm, <HI>Don Fran|cisco de la Cueva</HI> hurt in the face with a stone, the Earl of <HI>Venaven|te</HI> wounded in the Arm with an arrow, the Earl of <HI>Alva</HI> had his hors killed under him, and divers Commanders, and other persons of account. The King's Standard was shot and tattered with two musket bullets, the Earl of <HI>Cisuentes</HI> holding it in his hand. However, that daie's work was of exceeding great im|portance, and was the means of giving a glorious end to these miserable distempers, although not so suddenly; For hereby the Common people were disabused, the allegations and excu|ses, of those of the <HI>Iunta,</HI> appearing to bee no less fals then mali|tious: for to give a more specious lustre to their forgeries, and gain credit with the People, they cunningly gave out, that the Queen was perfectly well, and in her right senses, and that all they did, was by her order (which was nothing so), whereby the blinde ignorant Commonaltie ran themselvs headlong into the precipice of those disasters, which I have, and hereafter shall relate. The glorie of this memorable exploit was properly to bee attributed to the Earl of <HI>Haro</HI>'s valor, who, contrarie to the Votes of divers others, would assault <HI>Tordesillas,</HI> in stead of fol|lowing their Armie, to seek satisfaction for having been out-da|red by them to fight, and blocked up in <HI>Rioseco,</HI> according to the others opinions and propositions.</P>

They wrote in like manner to the Bishop, and other Captains, but <HI>Don Pedro</HI> took no great notice thereof, neither did hee make any other shew, then that hee would go to <HI>Valladolid</HI> himself. Divers disorderly Captains, like sheep without a shepherd, with their Companies, came and took up their Quarters at <HI>Villa|nubla,</HI> two leagues from <HI>Valladolid</HI>: Others went to <HI>Valladolid</HI> with their plunder, 'mongst others, two horsmen brought in a thousand Sheep, others fiftie, others two hundred Mules, Mares, and Carts loaden with linnen, and all manner of housholdstuff, taken from the poor Countrie-men, to the value of above three Millions of <HI>Maravediz,</HI> which they sold in the Citie, for little or nothing; a Wether was sold for two <HI>Ryalls,</HI> an Ewe for one, and a Cow for two <HI>Duckets</HI>; But the mischief was the greater, in that the poor shepherds and husbandmen, having ransomed their cattle and goods, before they had gon half a league, the Souldiers would plunder them again, spoiling and robbing friend and foe, as much as they could. By which exorbitancies they began to see, how much better it would have been to have satisfied their King's demands, although the tax was somwhat heavie; But so great acts of disobedience never passed long with|out such just punishments: Their outrageous impudence grew to such a height, that without any reverence or respect, they robb'd and spoiled the very Churches, as if they had been In|fidels; Women were not secure in their houses, nor men by the high waies. <HI>Valladolid,</HI> to prevent further disorder in this kinde, Commanded that those straggling Souldiers, which were to the number of six hundred, should return to their Colours at <HI>Villanubla,</HI> where their Captains were, and there they gave them ten daies paie more to endear them to go before <HI>Tordesillas</HI>; whither also marched, with all expedition, men from <HI>Salamanca, Toro,</HI> and <HI>Zamora,</HI> in great numbers, thinking to catch the <HI>Cava|liers</HI> in the Climm.

The Nobles in <HI>Torde|sillas</HI> sent for the Cardinal, who remained in <HI>Rioseco,</HI> with those of the Garrison. <HI>Don Rodrigo de Mendo&ccedil;a,</HI> Earl of <HI>Castro,</HI> who came to <HI>Medina de Rioseco</HI> with his men, too late for the expedi|tion of <HI>Tordesillas,</HI> attended upon the Cardinal thither; where, his Eminence beeing arrived, the Lord Admiral solemnly accep|ted the Joint-government of the Kingdoms, with the Cardi|nal, and the Lord High Constable, having first tried all means possible to reduce the people fairly to the obedience of his Ma|jestie; for after the taking of <HI>Tordesillas,</HI> hee sent <HI>Gomez de Avila,</HI> (who was there made prisoner) making him first swear to re|turn, to treat with <HI>Don Pedro Giron,</HI> and the rest of the <HI>Iunta,</HI> of|fering them very honorable Conditions, if they would laie down their Arms and com in. But <HI>Gomez</HI> beeing returned without concluding any thing, there was no apparent hope of any ac|commodation: besides, seeing that the <HI>Iunta,</HI> and the forces of the Commoners, were retired to <HI>Valladolid,</HI> (which was but five leagues from <HI>Tordesillas</HI>) and that it was no time of year to keep the field, or besiege any other Citie, leaving the enemies to them|selvs; the Governors, with consent of the rest of the Nobles, put all their Souldiers in Garrison in the adjacent Towns; For divers of their men were gon away, having enriched themselvs with the plunder which they took at <HI>Tordesillas.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Haro,</HI> with som chois companies, remained in <HI>Tordesillas,</HI> for the Guard of her Majestie's person, and defence of the Town. <HI>Don Pedro Velez,</HI> Earl of <HI>On~ate,</HI> with som Hors and Foot Companies, was placed in <HI>Simancas,</HI> though the Government thereof belong|ed to <HI>Don Hernando de Vega,</HI> but hee beeing of the Emperor's;

Betwixt the Towns which were for the Commoners, and those wherein were Garri|sons for his Majestie, was such killing, robbing, and spoiling, as if they had been the most mortal enemies in the world, as shall bee declared hereafter. Artificers could get no emploiment; Husband|men could not till their grounds, Merchants had no traffick, Cities lost their correspondence with each other, becaus the waies were unsecure; Justice was quite out of date; Ex|cise, Tributes, Levies, Impositions increased daily, by reason of the excessive charges of the Armie, the Revenue of the Roial Crown (which they had usurped) not bee|ing sufficient to defraie them. These, and such like, were the fruits and profit which <HI>Castilla</HI> reaped by their dis|obedience: And yet for all their miserable condition, they did not humble nor submit themselvs, neither would they accept of the honorable and advantageous Conditions which were offered them: But everie daie they were sending fresh men to maintein and foment the War from <HI>Valladolid,</HI> where those, who cast the Kingdom into this precipice, had taken up their seat. Although they were so jealous and displeased at their Captain General DON PEDRO GIRON, (especially the Com|mon people) that they did neither obey nor respect him, neither did hee hold himself secure amongst them, and therefore hee left them soon after, as you shall see.</P>

But those of <HI>Alava,</HI> beeing much inclined to the Earl of <HI>Salvatierra,</HI> said, That they were upon a certain agreement with those of the Province of <HI>Guipuzcoa,</HI> which beeing concluded, they would obey as far as they were obliged. But the Deputie <HI>Diego Martinez,</HI> and all his friends, received the said notification with due respect. The Citie of <HI>Vitoria</HI> returned an answer to the Lord High Constable, but would not give him the title of Governor; whereupon som words passed between <HI>Iohn de Alava,</HI> &amp; the rest, who bade him, in scurvie terms, go out of the Assemblie; but he boldly answered, Get you gon, like Traitors and Rebels: for which words, they caused him to bee apprehen|ded. In this <HI>interim,</HI> a Priest, from the Earl of <HI>Salvatierra,</HI> desired to have conference with those of the Assemblie: which the Deputie, <HI>Diego Martinez,</HI> knowing, privately stole out from the rest, and laid hands upon this Priest, clapt him in prison, and having opened his packet, hee found several Letters to Friers, and other particu|lar men, desiring them to induce the people to denie their obedi|ence to the Governors. This bred a main disorder, and libels were scattered about by the people: yet <HI>Martinez,</HI> &amp; <HI>Pedro de Alava,</HI> with all those of their kindred and alliance, resolutely determi|ned to maintein his Majestie's Interest, pressing and requiring all the rest to subscribe also to his Commands; if not, they protested against them, styling them no otherwise, then Rebellious and disloial Traitors.

Here|upon <HI>Fray Francisco</HI> took a resolution to go himself to <HI>Tordesillas,</HI> to confer, with the Cardinal and Lord Admiral; and beeing there, they sent for <HI>Ortiz,</HI> who went to them upon Shrove-tues|daie, <HI>Anno</HI> 1521, hee alighted at the Monasterie of <HI>Santa Clara,</HI> where <HI>Fray Francisco</HI> lodged, and in regard it was past midnight, there was then no possibilitie of speaking with the Lord Admi|ral; but the next morning, hee coming to hear Mass in the same Monasterie, went up into <HI>Fray Francisco</HI>'s chamber, where <HI>Ortiz</HI> hid himself; all that morning until dinner time they spent in treating about the Articles, in the Afternoon they did the like; and it was God's will, that before they parted, all was fully con|cluded, to the contentment and satisfaction of each partie, where|of were transcribed two Copies, one signed and sealed by the Cardinal and Lord Admiral, as Governors, obliging themselvs punctually to perform all and every the Articles therein contein|ed, and procure them to bee confirmed by his Majestie, provi|ded that <HI>Don Pedro Lasso</HI> did make good what hee had promised. <HI>Ortiz</HI> durst not carrie this writing to <HI>Valladolid,</HI> fearing lest the Guards should search him. So it was agreed, that <HI>Fray Francisco de los Angeles</HI> should carrie it to <HI>Abrojo,</HI> a Monasterie of Friers, a league short of <HI>Valladolid,</HI> (for hee durst not venture to go into the Citie with that about him) and that <HI>Ortiz</HI> should send som trustie messenger thither for it. <HI>Ortiz</HI> returned the same night (half
<PB N="314" REF="163">
frozen) to <HI>Valladolid,</HI> and the Guards let him in without tou|ching him, hee telling them that hee came from <HI>Medina del Cam|po.</HI> Beeing entred the Citie, hee went immediately to <HI>Don Pe|dro Lasso,</HI> whom hee informed fully of all the passages, and that <HI>Fray Francisco de los Angeles</HI> was to bring the Articles of agreement in writing, signed and sealed that same night to <HI>Abrojo</HI>; which hee did, the Earl of <HI>On~ate</HI> giving him a Convoy of twentie Hors from <HI>Simancas,</HI> who put him safe within the gates of the said Monasterie, <HI>Don Pedro</HI> and <HI>Ortiz</HI> were in pain long time, how they should send with safetie for this writing, and at last they re|solved one <HI>Fray Pedro de san Hippolito</HI> (of the Monasterie <HI>Del Prado</HI> (which was without the Citie) who was <HI>Don Pedro</HI>'s Confessor) should go for it. Hee accepted the emploiment, and went to <HI>Abrojo,</HI> and having received the writing of <HI>Fray Francisco de los Angeles,</HI> hee returned; but beeing com near to <HI>Valladolid</HI> about Sun|setting, hee met with certain souldiers which had been roving abroad, who seeing the Frier in that rode, imagined that hee came from <HI>Simancas,</HI> and thinking him to bee a Spie (or rather for greediness of his mule) they laid hands on him, saying, Hee was a Traitor, and that hee came from <HI>Simancas</HI> to give the Ca|valiers intelligence of what passed in <HI>Valladolid.</HI> In this rude manner they led him into the Citie, calling him Traitor, and saying, that they wovld strip him, to see what Letters hee brought to any particular persons; so they brought him to an hous close by the gate, where they made him alight to bee stript. But it was God's great mercie to deliver <HI>Don Pedro,</HI> and the rest that were engaged with him out of this danger: for just as <HI>Fray Pedro</HI> was forced to alight from his mule,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note that seldom hath there been any Trea|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">herie com|mitted, but a Frier, or som Cler|gie man, had a hand in it.</NOTE> two <HI>Franciscan</HI> Friers came most happily thither, to whom <HI>Fray Pedro</HI> addressing him|self, with a neat slight of hand, and a notable resolution, drew the papers out of his own sleev, and slipt them into one of theirs, beseeching him for God's sake to fling them into the fire, and let no bodie see them: thus hee deceived the eies of above five hun|dred people that were gathered together to strip him: vvhich they did, but finding no papers at all about him, they carried him before <HI>Pedro de Touar,</HI> one of the <HI>Regidores,</HI> and Captain of <HI>Valladolid,</HI> vvho knovving him, commanded them presently to

<P>THe <HI>Franciscan</HI> Friers, having read these Articles, did burn them, as <HI>Fray Pedro</HI> desired; but they could not refrain from speaking thereof to som others, and they to others, so that at last it was the common Town-talk, and it was carried to the <HI>Iunta. Don Pedro Lasso</HI> somwhat troubled, asked <HI>Ortiz</HI> what they should do; who bad him bee of a good courage, and if any questi|on came of it, to saie, it was a trick of the Cavaliers, to sow dis|cord amongst them, and although they had begun with him, doubtless, ere long, they would do the like to others. It fell out (as <HI>Don Pedro</HI> feared) that hee was questioned in the <HI>Iun|ta</HI> hereupon; but hee was so well prepared to answer them, ab|solutely denying the Charge, that with his smooth and resolute answers they were satisfied; in regard there was no evidence, nor any ground of suspecting, but meerly from the bare words of the Friers. This sore beeing well salved, <HI>Ortiz</HI> wen again to <HI>Fray Pedro,</HI> desiring him to venture once more to <HI>Tordesillas,</HI> and acquaint the Lord Admiral of what had passed, and be|seech him to send another Copie of the Articles, like the former, which was lost; which hee told him, hee might safely enough do in the night, there beeing a Monasterie of his Order just in the waie to <HI>Tordesillas,</HI> whither hee would send another mes|senger to bring it to <HI>Valladolid.</HI> The Frier went, and beeing arrived at <HI>Tordesillas,</HI> hee told the Lord Admiral the storie of his adventures, and how the former Copie had miscarried, and therefore <HI>Don Pedro,</HI> and <HI>Ortiz,</HI> desired him to send another. The Lord Admiral wondered at the Frier's strange relation, and thanked God with him for his deliverie, and gave him forth|with another copie <HI>verbatim</HI> like the first, wherewith hee re|turned in the night to his Monasterie, whither <HI>Ortiz</HI> sent one of his own servants, who brought it safe into <HI>Valladolid.</HI> Hereupon <HI>Don Pedro Lasso</HI> began to undermine, &amp; cunningly to confer with som gentlemen &amp; Comissioners of the <HI>Junta,</HI> concerning the mi|series
<PB N="316" REF="164">
of the times, persuading them to condescend to a peace, &amp; to bee reduced to the good, and tranquillitie of the Kingdoms, in re|gard that was the end of their Assembling and rising up in arms. Som thought this Proposition but just and reasonable, others absolutely dis-approved it. All these passages were particularly related to the General of the <HI>Dominican</HI> Order, then beeing at <HI>Tordesillas,</HI> who persuaded the Grandees of the Kingdom to send Letters to those of the <HI>Iunta</HI> General, and to the Particular <HI>Iunta</HI> of <HI>Valladolid,</HI> to this effect; That in regard both Parties did fer|vently desire the good, and quiet of the Kingdom, and that each in particular did pretend to advance it, yet they spoiled and but|chered one another without sens or reason, beeing all Natives of the same Countrie, and their intentions (though in a different waie) steering the same Cours. Therefore for the better under|standing of each other, if the Gentlemen of the <HI>Iunta</HI> would no|minate any two of the Commissioners, and send them to the Monasterie of S^t <HI>Thomas,</HI> which is without <HI>Tordesillas,</HI> to treat with them, they would at the same time appoint two of their partie to go to the Monasterie <HI>del Prado,</HI> not far from <HI>Valladolid,</HI> to confer with those of the <HI>Iunta</HI>; by which means they might com to som reasonable agreement, for the satisfaction and gene|ral good of the Kingdoms, and that there might bee no more war or dissention amongst them, which had been the occasion of so much damage and miserie. Those of the <HI>Iunta</HI> (divers of them beeing indifferently well inclined, and seeing <HI>Don Pedro Lasso,</HI> who was one of the principal amongst them, lean that waie) were so far from dissenting, that without further delay, they appointed him, and <HI>Alonso de Guadalaxara,</HI> Commissioner of <HI>Segovia,</HI> to go in their names to <HI>Tordesillas,</HI> giving first notice to the Cavaliers thereof, and wishing them to send their Agents to <HI>Prado,</HI> as was agreed, both giving securitie and pledges that their Messengers should pass without danger or molestation. This was concluded on Fridaie, <HI>March</HI> the 10^t^h 1521. On Saturdaie night following arrived at <HI>Valladolid,</HI> those whom the Governors sent for pledges; but those who were against this Treatie, ha|ving consulted with <HI>Iohn de Padilla,</HI> who likewise did not relish it, gave order to those upon the Guard, not to let any into the
<PB N="317" REF="164">
Citie that came from <HI>Tordesillas,</HI> but to take away their Letters, and seiz upon their persons: Insomuch that a messenger with a Pass for them, beeing com to <HI>Valladolid,</HI> the Guards would have apprehended him, but hee was so circumspect, that hee got clear of them, and returned to <HI>Tordesillas.</HI> This was not done by the general consent of the <HI>Iunta,</HI> but onely by those which were against the Treatie; and the rest of the <HI>Junta</HI> marvelled that the Cavaliers did not keep their words, in sending their Pass, or safe Conduct for the Commissioners, according to their own motion.</P>

The <HI>Iunta,</HI> to satisfie them, did name <HI>Don Pedro,</HI> but hee desired som time to think upon it, before hee would accept it, and those that bare him no good will, began to divulge his beeing made General, in a disparaging manner, saying, It was more honor then hee de|served, in regard hee had given them so much reason to suspect his fidilitie, for holding correspondence with the Governors to sell them, and that <HI>Iohn de Padilla</HI> was much more fit for that Command. This was so much buzz'd amongst the people, that they began to murmur highly against <HI>Don Pedro.</HI> The mutinie

growing to such an height, that <HI>Don Pedro,</HI> and his friends, not thinking themselvs secure, prepared to make resistance, in case they should assault them in their houses, as som gave out they would. And (they saie) the very school-boys, instructed by their masters so to do, ran crying up and down the streets, Let <HI>Iohn de Padilla</HI> bee General, and not <HI>Don Pedro Lasso.</HI> The Bishop of <HI>Zamora</HI> sent him word that his safest waie would bee to ab|sent himself from the Citie, or at least, to retire into some secret place, for the people were very jealous of him, and in their furie would bee apt to do him some displeasure, but this was onely a plot to entrap him. <HI>Don Pedro</HI> very resolutely returned the Bishop this answer, That hee had done nothing that hee was ashamed of, or ought to run awaie for, and that hee would not stir out of his hous, if the people had any thing to saie to him, there they should finde him. The people's design upon <HI>Don Pedro Lasso</HI> bee|ing publickly known, some principal persons of the Citie came amongst them, and so handled the matter, that they all retired to their houses, and there was no harm done.</P>

<P>THose of the <HI>Junta,</HI> beeing in consultation about the order|ing of their Armie (for there was no more thought of peace) some said, that it was very requisite that they should have a Captain General, and although <HI>Iohn de Padilla</HI> had executed the office ever since <HI>Don Pedro Giron</HI> had left it, yet hee had not his Commission from the <HI>Junta,</HI> neither had the present Armie (which the several Cities had raised) acknowledged him. Som stood for <HI>Don Pedro Lasso de la Vega</HI>; but the major part of the <HI>Junta,</HI> and all the Common people Voted for <HI>John de Padilla.</HI> Hee seeing that they would make him their Captain General, out of a feigned modestie refused it, earnestly desiring them all to give their Votes rather for <HI>Don Pedro Lasso,</HI> who was more worthie and capable of so high a Charge then hee, not that hee declined their service however, but hee would content himself with the Command of the two thousand men which hee brought from <HI>Toledo,</HI> with whom, and with his own person,
<PB N="319" REF="165">
hee would serv the Commonaltie to the last breath. The peo|ple hearing that <HI>John de Padilla</HI> was like to bee outed, they came crying in a tumultuous mannertothe <HI>Junta,</HI> and pres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing them to make <HI>John de Padilla</HI> their General, for no man els should bee. And thinking that <HI>Dom Pedro Lasso</HI> was the onely man that hin|dred the election of <HI>John de Padilla,</HI> the multitude ran presently to apprehend him in his hous, laying to his charge that hee had used means to reduce them to his Majestie's service, that hee had been caus that the Cavaliers had taken <HI>Tordesillas,</HI> having been in the conspiracie with <HI>Don Pedro Giron.</HI> But the Bishop and <HI>John de Padilla</HI> followed, and staied them in the great market place. Assoon as ever the rabble saw the Bishop and him, they flocked round about them crying out, <HI>Let John de Padilla live, let the Bishop live, long may live John de Padilla, who take's away the taxes of Castilla.</HI> In this manner did the multitude carrie him up and down the market place, hooting and shooting as if they had been all mad; insomuch that <HI>Iohn de Padilla</HI> could not speak to them, if hee would have said any thing, they kept so horrid a nois, saying, Hee should bee their General, and no other. <HI>Iohn de Padilla,</HI> and the Bishop, seeing this fond madness of the people, withdrew themselvs into a hous, out of a window, whereof <HI>Iohn de Pa|dilla</HI> spake to them in this manner;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hn de P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|dilla</HI>'s speech to the Com|mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> peo|pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in <HI>Val|lado<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">id.</HI></NOTE> Sirs!

But the Lords of the <HI>Iunta</HI> have determined to choos a Captain General for thir Expedition: Believ mee (sirs!) it is most fit that place should go by Election, and I assure you that I was the first man that made that motion, for that is the best and safest waie; moreover, those Gentlemen know very well what they do. Hee scars had uttered these words, but they all cried out, <HI>Wee will have none but</HI> John de Padilla, <HI>and the Bi|shop.</HI> Thus they continued for the space of a long hour, and
<PB N="320" REF="166">
more, <HI>Iohn de Padilla</HI> entreating them to give their consents, that <HI>Don Pedro Lasso</HI> might execute that office, for nevertheless hee should bee readie to spend his father's and his own estate, be|sides the ventring of his life in that Holie Caus, for the service of the Commonaltie. But no reason would stop their mouths, they still continued crying, hee and non els should bee their Captain. Which obstinacie of the people, beeing reported to those of the <HI>Iunta,</HI> they Voted <HI>Iohn de Padilla</HI> Captain General of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll their forces. From that daie forwards, <HI>Don Pedro Lasso</HI> began to relinquish the Commonaltie, and divers of his friends did the like, seeing how blind and void of reason the people were, and how much prejudice they did themselvs, in following a people so overswaied with passion, and the greatest part of them too but men of mean and obscure extraction.</P>

<P>ALthough the Cavaliers did treat of an Accommodation, yet they ceased not to get what arms, and assemble what for|ces they could. The general Letters signed by the Cardinal, Lord Admiral, and Earl of <HI>Haro</HI> at <HI>Tordesillas,</HI> with the date in blank, I have seen in the Lord High Constable's hands, with di|vers other originals.

<P>THe Commonalties, especially <HI>Valladolid,</HI> were much dis|pleased that those of the <HI>Iunta,</HI> and the Commanders of the Armie did so prolong the War, for alreadie they were so ex|hausted, that they found themselvs not able to sustain it. And <HI>Valladolid,</HI> who had so vast a charge of souldiers to maintain, and suffered exceedingly, by the continual assaults and incursions, which those of <HI>Simancas</HI> made into their Territories, was more sensible of the smart then any of the other Cities, and never left praying and threatning in publick and in private, until they had persuaded or forced the Captains to march out with their Armie, and to end the dispute with the Cavaliers in on battle. Upon Saturdaie night of the first week in Lent the 17 of <HI>February</HI> 1521. <HI>Iohn de Padilla,</HI> with the greatest privacie that might bee, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t his design should bee discovered, marched with his men out of <HI>Valladolid</HI> to <HI>Zaratan</HI> (a Village within a league of the Citie) where hee quartered that night. From whence hee went the

same night with fourtie hors directly to <HI>Simancas.</HI> Beeing ar|rived at the Watch-Tower, which was upon a hill a little above the Town, <HI>Iohn de Padilla</HI> asked the fellow which kept it, if hee had perceived any thing of the enemie; The man thinking hee had been som of their Garrison, said, Yes; I saw a great number of men march from <HI>Valladolid</HI> to <HI>Zaratan,</HI> which make's my heartake, for wee have but a few left in <HI>Simancas. Iohn de Padilla</HI> presently laied hands on him, and carried him to his Quarters, where having secured him, hee returned tow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rds <HI>Simancas,</HI> by the waie hee lighted upon a partie of their hors, that had been scouring the Countrie, those hee charged and chased into the very Town, after which hee returned to <HI>Zaratan,</HI> with a great prise of sheep, which hee took from them. Three daies after this, came more men out of <HI>Valladolid</HI> with the Artilerie of <HI>Medina.</HI> Next daie after them, marched out those that came from <HI>los Gelves,</HI> who were quartered in <HI>Zaratan, Arroyo,</HI> and other places about <HI>Simancas,</HI> with them came the Bishop of <HI>Zamora,</HI> who although sick, would not staie behind the Armie, saying, That in defence of the liberties of the Kingdom, dead or alive, sick or in health, how|ever hee would follow the Camp, such was the courage and animositie of a Prelate threescore years old at least. Besides all these, came to joyn with him likewise <HI>Iohn Bravo</HI> and <HI>Francisco Maldonado,</HI> with all their forces and divers hors-men. Some daies they remained in <HI>Zaratan,</HI> pillaging and taking what they could from those of <HI>Simancas</HI> and <HI>Torrelobaton.</HI> Some daies they took from the Inhabitants of the enemie's Quarters 1500 sheep <HI>per diem,</HI> and though it was Lent, their Bishop gave them leav to eat flesh, so they wanted for no good cheer. Another time <HI>Iohn de Padilla</HI> marched out of his Quarters with a great partie of hors, and met with some of <HI>Simancas</HI> and <HI>Torrelobaton's</HI> Gar|risons, and after an hot skirmish, wherein som on both sides were killed, <HI>Iohn de Padilla</HI> took fiftie Cavaliers, horses and arms, for which hee might have had great sums of monie, if hee would have ransomed them, but hee refused it.</P>

<P>IT beeing a holie time (in <HI>Lent</HI>) and the War dangerous and prejudicial, divers good Religious men interceded for an Ac|comodation of these differences, and to procure an absolute Peace, if possible.

<P>ON Thursdaie, the 21 of <HI>Februarie, Iohn de Padilla</HI> marched out of <HI>Zaratan</HI> with his whole Camp (which consisted of seven thousand Foot, and five hundred Lances) at two of the clock after midnight, going very silently in good order, and taking Guides along with them to shew them the waie to <HI>Tor|relobaton,</HI> in the very Suburbs whereof hee took up his quarters, robbing and plundering all they could lay hands on; but the people had carried all their best goods into the Town, which was very strong.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hn de Pa|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lla</HI> besie|geth <HI>Torre|l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bation.</HI></NOTE> The next daie <HI>Iohn de Padilla</HI> commanded his great Ordnance to bee planted in convenient places, to batter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he Town, which hee did very smartly; but all his shots were
<PB N="327" REF="169">
to little purpose, for the rampires were extraordinarie. After this hee gave them a brisk assault, with great clamors of men, and bouncing of Guns, but hee got nothing by that, for the be|sieged defended themselvs with much resolution. In this Con|flict (which lasted all daie) were divers slain and hurt, but the most part were of <HI>Iohn de Padilla's</HI> men, who fought at disad|vantage, having no defence nor rampires to shelter them; so that seeing the great loss hee received, and the little good hee did, mos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of their ladders beeing too short, and those that ventured to mount up, were either knock'd down dead, or shrewdly woun|ded, hee thought it his best waie to fall off, and sound a Retreat; so the combate ceased for that time: All that night <HI>Iohn de Padilla</HI> labored to entrench himself, and rais a batterie in another place, that hee might give them another fresh assault the next daie. The Lord Admiral, and the others at <HI>Tordesillas,</HI> beeing advertised of <HI>Iohn de Padilla's</HI> beeing advanced to <HI>Torrelabaton,</HI> sent presently to draw the Garrisons out of <HI>Simancas,</HI> and <HI>Portillo,</HI> with intent to reliev <HI>Torrelobaton,</HI> if possible, although they were but weak in Foot, and the enemie had great store, and very good. First they sent out two Troops of Hors to discover the order and strength of the enemie's Camp, with whom they had som slight skir|mishes. This daie <HI>Iohn de Padilla</HI> wasted in raising a new bat|terie, and planting his Artillerie, but hee found that p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rt of the Town no less strong then the former, so that hee could do no execution; but on the morrow (which was the third daie of his beeing there) hee removed his Ordnance to another part of the wall, which was weaker, where hee made som brea|ches, which those of <HI>Valladolid</HI> and <HI>Toledo</HI> spying, ran present|ly hurrying without order to enter; the dispute continu|ed very hot a great while; but the Besieged behaved them|selvs so gallantly, that they were forced to retreat with no smal loss. The same daie the Earl of <HI>Haro,</HI> Captain General, having left a sufficient Guard in <HI>Tordesillas,</HI> marched out to face the enemie, with a matter of a thousand Lances, intending to give the Alarm on one side of the Town, whil'st the Governor <HI>Don Francisco Ossorio,</HI> Lord of <HI>Valdonquillo</HI> carried in a fresh suppli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of souldiers on the other. Hee desired of the Lord Admiral
<PB N="328" REF="170">
that they might bee Horsmen, but the Earl of <HI>Haro</HI> thought that not so convenient, hee having more need of the Cavalrie for the field-battle: Beeing com within sight of the Town in the Evening, they staied upon the top of a hill, whence the Earl sent a partie of his Hors to skirmish with som Arcabusiers, (who beeing betwixt the besieged, and the mud-walls, stood much to their advantage) but seeing his men cruelly galled, and able to do no good there, hee commanded they should retreat to the bo|die, which was still upon the hill expecting <HI>Don Francisco Ossorio</HI> to put in execution their intended design: but whil'st they were thus staying, arrived a Gentleman with a Letter from the Lord Admiral, to the Earl of <HI>Haro,</HI> saying, That hee might return a|gain, for hee had notice since, that there was no such need of putting any succor into <HI>Torrelobaton,</HI> for there was already strength sufficient to defend it; notwithstanding this counter|mand, divers Gentlemen offered to go into the Town; but it could not bee attempted, the Lord Admiral having forbidden the Ladders to bee brought, which were agreed upon. So it beho|ved the Earl to go back again that night to <HI>Tordesillas,</HI> without bringing his purpose to effect, to satisfie the Lord Admiral, who (as it afterwards proved) was very much over-seen therein: But som say, hee was angrie becaus the Earl of <HI>Haro</HI> did not follow his advice in the prosecution of that design. <HI>Iohn de Pa|dilla</HI> beeing alarmed by these thousand Hors, and finding that hee had not force enough for the offensive and defensive both, sent presently to <HI>Valladolid</HI> for more. Upon receipt of his Letter, three thousand Foot, and four hundred Hors were ordered to march to the Armie at <HI>Torrelobaton,</HI> vvho vvent vvith as good a will to fight, as if they had gon to gain the <HI>Iubilee.</HI> On Satur|day 28 <HI>Febr.</HI> they arrived in the suburbs, to the no less rejoicing and encouragement of the Besiegers, then the dis-heartening and terror of the Besieged; who sent to the Lord Admiral, com|plaining very much of <HI>Valladolid,</HI> saying, That onely that Citie <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">id them all the mischief. Sunday, Munday, and Tuesday they bat|tered incessantly with all their Ordnance, and very many were killed on both sides: A man could not peep above the wall, but hee had presently a bullet, or an arrow in his head: yet the Ca|valiers
<PB N="329" REF="170">
stood out manfully; but beeing not above four hundred Foot, and som few Hors, they were not able to defend them|selvs, and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">thstand the continual assaults of the Enemie, ha|ving no intermission nor time to take any rest, besides provisions began to fail them. <HI>Iohn de Padilla</HI> having raised several batte|ries against the Town, at last one of them made a breach, where (whil'st the besieged were defending themselvs in another part of the Town) those of <HI>Valladolid</HI> entred with their Colors; they sacked the Town with the greatest crueltie in the world: they killed the poor laboring men, becaus they could not give them what they demanded, spilled all their Wines, breaking the tubs in pieces; they plundered the Churches, stript the Altars, and broke open the Tombs, thinking to finde som hidden treasure therein. Finally they did such things, that the most savage bruits, who have not the use of reason, could not do wors, respecting neither humane things nor divine. Next daie beeing Wednes|daie, they fell to battering of the Tower, which defended it self stoutly, but beeing full of women and children that had retired themselvs thither for securitie (who feeling it shake at everie shot that hit it) cried out, fearing it would fall upon their heads, and having nothing to eat, it was surrendered upon condition to secure all their lives,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>John de Pa|dilla</HI> take'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Torreloba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> and the Tower.</NOTE> and half their goods. Thus <HI>Iohn d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Padilla</HI> took <HI>Torrelobaton,</HI> which was no inconsiderable piece of service&punc; Hereby hee gained himself much reputation amongst the Com|mon-people, it beeing but three leagues from <HI>Tordesillas,</HI> where the Governors, with all their forces, were. The Towns which stood for the Commonaltie, made great shews of rejoicing for this Vi|ctorie. The Lord Admiral, and those that were with him, were cruelly netled hereat, and beeing vexed more for their honor's sake, then for the importance of the place, they resolved to bee revenged. So they gave notice forthwith to the Lord High Con|stable of all passages, who commanded immediately four thou|sand men (which hee had ready) with four pieces of Ord|nance, to march by the waie of <HI>Palencia</HI> to <HI>Tordesillas,</HI> whereof <HI>Don Iohn de Mendo&ccedil;a</HI> having intelligence, sallied out of <HI>Valladolid</HI> with above four thousand Foo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and stopt their passage.

<PB N="330" REF="171">
men enough in <HI>Tordesillas</HI> to encounter <HI>Iohn de Padilla,</HI> who was very strong, besides all the Cities beeing their enemies, they sent to demand a Truce for eight daies of <HI>Iohn de Padilla,</HI> which al|though he, and som of the Commissioners that were with him, were not unwilling to grant, yet they durst not, without con|sulting with <HI>Valladolid</HI>; for in regard they stood in great need of that Citie, and were very much favored and assisted by them, they bare them a singular respect, and would determine nothing without their privitie. This was communicated to all the people of <HI>Valladolid,</HI> and discussed; at length they all agreed to return this answer, That they should by no means grant them any truce, no, not for one hour, but proceed against them with all manner of rigor; for it was most certain, that they demanded a Truce for nothing els, but meerly to recruit themselvs of men and provisions, to the prejudice of the Commonaltie; and if they did grant them eight or fifteen daies libertie, by the ancient law of the Kingdom they might renew their Cessation still to ninetie and six daies, and so from ninetie six to ninetie six, until the year were out; by which procrastinations, the Commonalties would bee destroied and ruined, and the people lose their courage and good zeal, which at present did animate them to defend their Liberties: yet notwithstanding <HI>Valladolid</HI> sent this answer, the Commissioners of the Kingdom, and the Commanders of the Armie did grant the Truce for eight daies, from Sunday to Sundaie.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="39" TYPE="section">

<P>THis Cessation was demanded after the taking of <HI>Torreloba|ton,</HI> although that much displeased the Lord Admiral, and <HI>Fray Francisco de los Angeles</HI> went to <HI>Valladolid,</HI> in his and the Car|dinal's name, to treat thereof, whom <HI>Alonso de Vera</HI> a bridler and one of the worshipful Citie officers, meeting at the Gate <HI>del Campo,</HI> treated very uncivilly, and would not suffer to enter into the Citie. After this, <HI>Alonso de Ortiz,</HI> with danger enough of his life, ventured to return thither, with Letters of credence to treat about the same business. Who beeing entred into the Citie,
<PB N="331" REF="171">
communicated his errand to <HI>Don Pedro de Ayala,</HI> and <HI>Don Her|nando de Ulloa,</HI> (whom hee found died in grain for his purpose) and forth with they gave order, that the <HI>Iunta</HI> should assemble to hear the message that <HI>Alonso de Ortiz</HI> brought from <HI>Tordesillas.</HI> Which beeing heard, and the Articles and conditions of the Truce being almost concluded, and the time for the continuance thereof limited; it chanced that <HI>Fray Pablo</HI> and <HI>Sancho Zimbron</HI> (who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ar|ried the Articles of the Kingdom into <HI>Flanders,</HI> to get them gran|ted and au<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">horized by his Majestie, as hath been alreadie menti|oned) arrived at <HI>Valladolid</HI>: And hearing that they were about a Treatie of Cessation of Arms, <HI>Fray Pablo</HI> presently sent notice of his arrival to the <HI>Iunta,</HI> desiring them that they would not con|clude of either Peace, or War, or Truce; until hee came to give them an account of the employment, upon which they had sent him into <HI>Flanders.</HI> Hereupon that business was suspended until the evening: And then the Commissioners of the Kingdom beeing set againe, <HI>Fray Pablo</HI> came and gave them an account of his journie, and what hee had done. Amongst other rela|tions, hee told them, that when hee came into <HI>Flanders,</HI> the Em|peror was gon into <HI>Germanie,</HI> whither hee and <HI>Sancho Zimbron</HI> in|tended to follow him; but by the waie hee was informed that his Majestie had given order (if they came into <HI>Germanie</HI>) to have them hanged; Whereupon they went no further. More|over, that hee knew that his Majestie was so displeased with those Articles, and so incensed against those that had a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y hand in the making of them, or in raising those Commotions in the Kingdom, that at his return into <HI>Spain,</HI> they should bee all severely punished, notwithstanding any engagement or promises the Governors had made to the contrarie in his name. This infor|mation the Frier gave the Commissioners of the Kingdoms, be|sides divers other particulars, which are too tedious to relate. In conclusion, hee told them that his advice was, that they should contract neither Peace nor Truce with the Grandees, but stand firm and unanimously persevere in their former resolution. So that if his Majestie would com again into their Kingdom, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> might bee through their means,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wholsom counsel of the Frier.</NOTE> and not by the Grandees. For that beeing done by a permissive will of the Kingdom, they
<PB N="332" REF="172">
might make their own conditions, and have what securitie they pleased; besides, they might so make their bargain, that if his Majestie did not perform his agreement with them, the King|dom might remain united and agreed, That all the people should assemble whensoever occasion did require, and stick close one to the other in what concerned them for their defence, and have sufficent assurance that the agreement made with them should bee performed. Wherefore his opinion was, that they ought not onely, not to grant the Truce which was desired, but couragiously to persist in the War, until they had destroyed the Grandees, and made the Commissioners of the Kingdom with the <HI>Iunta,</HI> Lords of the Countrie. Notwithstanding this dis|cours of <HI>Fray Pablo,</HI> the Commissioners commanded <HI>Ortiz</HI> to continue the Treatie. After all this, it hapned that the Frier sitting next to <HI>Ortiz,</HI> and taking him to bee a Commissioner of som Citie, that was com to the <HI>Iunta</HI> since his departure, hee be|gan to repeat som thing of his discours to the other Commissi|oners, but chiefly harped upon the Emperor's intent to punish the Commoners, notwithstanding any pardon the Governors should promise them in his behalf. Whereupon, not well brooking his speeches, <HI>Ortiz</HI> asked him how hee knew the Em|peror had any such thought: Hee answered hee was told so. Then <HI>Ortiz</HI> could hold no longer, but with a voice that might bee heard by all in the room, said, That hee wondred that a man of his coat and gravitie, beeing a Doctor of Divinitie, who ought to give good example, should positively saie a thing of such importance (as that which hee had verified to those Gentlemen in these words, (<HI>That notwithstanding any pardon the Gavernors should grant, confirmed by his Majestie, those who had raised the Commotions in the Kingdom, his Majestie would punish at his return, as if they had been taken in the fact</HI>) upon no other certaintie, but onely hear-saie; In regard those words were enough to disturb and hinder the conclusion of the Truce, which might produce a Peace, and those of his dignitie and profession ought rather to endeavour to make Peace, when other hopes failed, then to hin|der and obstruct the means of procuring it. The Frier hearing this, was very wrath, and asked who hee was; It beeing told him
<PB N="333" REF="172">
that <HI>Ortiz</HI> was the man that sollicited for the Truce in behalf of the Cavaliers, hee stole out of the <HI>Iunta. Ortiz</HI> staied still, treat|ing with the Commissioners about the conditions of the Truce. In mean time <HI>Fray Pablo</HI> went to som of the Citie, telling them that they had suffered a Traitor to com in amongst them, whom the Grandees had sent under the notion of treating a Truce, to espie what was done in the Citie, and to sound the People's in|clinations: That in his opinion they ought to turn him out of the Citie, or apprehend him, and make him confess the principal caus of his coming thither. Presently the Commoners, in whose heads hee had buzz'd these things, went along with him to the <HI>Iunta,</HI> all armed, and boldly rushed into the Chamber where they sate, asking them very peremptorily, why they suffered a Traitor to com into the Citie, to spie and make advantage of their proceedings; requiring the Commissioners forthwith to discharge him the Ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ie, otherwise they would apprehend him and make him give them an account of his business there; Other high language and threatnings they used, which put <HI>Ortiz</HI> in a bodily fear. The Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">missioners with smooth and flat|tering words pacified them in such sort, that they went quietly awaie. Which done, <HI>Ortiz</HI> thus spake unto them, Gentlemen, If becaus I came hither upon your words and assurance to treat of the Truce, this stir and combustion hath been rais<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, rather then the people shall turn mee out of the Citie, I will depart: But if you pleas to treat further of the business, for which I have undertaken this journie, and will promiss as you are Gentle|men to secure and defend mee, notwithstanding their me|naces, I will staie until all bee concluded. Those of the <HI>Junta</HI> answered, that they were contented, and gave him their words, upon the faith of Gentlemen, to defend him.

<P>_THe passions seated in the Souls of men are in effect not unlike to the recoverie of a bodie out of some desperate sickness: For any the least excess cast's the affected Partie into a re|lapse, and by an untimely precipitation hur|rieth him into the Sepulchre. The Cavaliers and the Commoners did not treat with that realtie as they ought: Some made a fair shew, and seemed to desire a Peace, though they were best contented with the War, for divers particular interests which they did receiv thereby.

Others dissembled (though not altogether) and the most part of those (which were called Commoners) were prepossessed with a diffident and distrustful humor, holding for uncertain and onely pretences, all the conditions that were offred them on the behalf of his Majestie and the Cavaliers. Whilest they were in a treatie during the eight daies of Truce, two things hapned which destroyed all the Impostume or poison where|with their hearts were swoln, bursting out into the disorders which in this Book shall bee related, and shall conclude this de|plorable Historie.

<P><HI>JOhn de Padilla</HI>'s staying so long at <HI>Torrelobaton</HI> was very prejudi|cial to the Commonalties; for besides that hee lost many men, hee gave the Cavaliers time to recruit and strengthen themselvs notably, whereas questionless if hee had fallen upon <HI>Tordesillas</HI> assoon as hee had taken in <HI>Torrelobaton,</HI> hee had driven them to extraordinarie straits. But he remained there hugging himself with that small victorie, and the applaus of the people, which hee had thereby procured: Hee fell to repairing the walls which hee had battered down, as if hee intended to make that the seat and residence of his Armie, which lasted not long after. The Cities of <HI>Toro</HI> and <HI>Zamora</HI> sent him som fresh supplies, whereof the Cavaliers having notice, they sent out a Partie of seven hundred Lances to cut off their waie, and their lives too, if they could; near <HI>Pedrosa</HI> they met, and after a prettie hot skir|mish, the Cavaliers forced them into the Town, where they besieged them close; but <HI>Iohn de Padilla</HI> having notice of his men's distress, soon came to reliev them with three thousand Foot, and five hundred Hors, leaving a sufficient Guard in <HI>Tor|relobaton</HI>: whom when the Cavaliers saw with so great force, they made their retreat good to <HI>Tordesillas</HI>; And <HI>Iohn de Padilla</HI> marched with his men to <HI>Castromonte</HI> (another Town of the Lord Admiral's) and having taken it, left a Garrison in it, and thence returned to <HI>Torrelobaton,</HI> intending to exspect the suc|cor

On the other side, the Governors agreed to put in effect what they had discussed amongst themselvs, which was, That the Lord high Constable coming from <HI>Burgos</HI> with his forces, they should all joyn in one bodie, and make up an Armie sufficient to en|counter <HI>Iohn de Padilla,</HI> in case hee should take the field, (the succors which hee exspected beeing arrived) or to besiege him where hee was: for beeing divided, they could not attempt ei|ther of those enterprises, without danger and a doubtfulness of the success, neither indeed had they strength enough to perform either design, considering they must leav a competent Garrison in <HI>Tordesillas.</HI> According to this resolution, the Lord High Con|stable,

the Bishop of <HI>Zamora</HI> present themselvs unto my pen. When hee marched from <HI>Valladolid,</HI> by the <HI>Iunta's</HI> order, hee gave out that hee went to take possession of the Arch-Bishoprick of of <HI>Toledo,</HI> then vacant by the death of <HI>Guillermo de Crouij,</HI> nephew to <HI>Monsieur de Xeures.</HI> Hee carried with him an hand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">om Armie of both Foot and Hors, with five field-pieces. In <HI>Toledo</HI> hee was very well received, and the Citie furnished him with more men and Artillerie, from <HI>Alcala de Henares</HI> hee took six Pieces more, so that hee had in all fifteen Pieces of Ordnance. <HI>Don Antonio de Zun~iga</HI> his adversarie was likewise very strong, having at least six thousand Foot, and pro|portionable number of Hors, besides divers Gentlemen that were com to assist him. Amongst whom <HI>Don Pedro de Guz|man,</HI> a valiant young Gentleman (whom his Majestie made the first Earl of <HI>Olivares</HI>) was chiefly taken notice of for his good service. I have already mentioned how the Dutchess of <HI>Medina Sidonia, Don~a Leonora de Zun~iga,</HI> by her masculine courage and re|solution, appeased the disorders and insurrection which <HI>Don Iohn de Figueroa</HI> attempted to rais in <HI>Sevilla</HI>: since which, hearing of the Commotions in the Kingdom of <HI>Toledo,</HI> and that her brother <HI>Don Antonio de Zun~iga,</HI> Prior of <HI>San Iuan,</HI> was engaged in the suppressing of them, shee pick'd out a thousand of her choicest Foot, and an hundred Hors, with six field-pieces, all at the Duke, her eldest son's charges, and sent <HI>Don Pedro de Guzman,</HI> her third son with them, to the end, in <HI>Don Antonio de Zuniga,</HI> his unkle's companie, hee should give testimonie of his valor and fidelitie to the Emperor, against those revolters. <HI>Don Diego de Caravajal,</HI> Lord of <HI>Todar,</HI> and his brother <HI>Don Alonso,</HI> came likewise to as|sist <HI>Don Antonio</HI> in this expedition with a reasonable number of men.

<P>AMongst other transactions in this War, the expedition of the Town of <HI>Mora</HI> was the most remarkable, and the most desastrous that yet hath been related: It was thus, The In|habitants of that Town beeing inclined to the interest of the Commonaltie, rose up in Arms, and so continued a certain time; But seeing the Power and Victorious proceedings of <HI>Don Antonio,</HI>
<PB N="351" REF="181">
they capitulated with him, and promised obedience to his Ma|jestie, (yet so little constancie there is amongst the Vulgar) af|ter their agreement, they revolted again, declaring for the Com|monaltie, as before: and not contented with this, seeing one of <HI>Don Antonio</HI>'s Captains pass by the Town, with som sheep and other cattle, which hee had taken in the confines of <HI>Toledo,</HI> they sallied out to the number of three hundred men, and rescued the Prize, forcing him to flie: whereupon, the next daie <HI>Don Diego de Caravajal,</HI> who was quartered two leagues thence at <HI>Almona|cid,</HI> marching out with his Hors, joined with <HI>Don Hernando de Robledo,</HI> who had the Command of som Foot companies, whom <HI>Don Antonio,</HI> at the instance and persuasion of <HI>Diego Lopez de Ava|los, Commendador</HI> of <HI>Mora,</HI> had sent to keep them in aw, and make them stand to their conditions; who advancing toge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her to the very walls of the Town, (which the Inhabitants had made as strong as they could) summoned them to deliver it for his Ma|jestie, and give them a peaceable entrance: But they sturdily re|fused, calling them Traitors, and reviling them in base injuri|ous terms, accompanied with many musket shots, and arrows. <HI>Don Hernando de Robledo,</HI> and those with him, enraged at this un|civil treatment, entred the Town by storm, and forced the Inha|bitants to retreat to the great Church, wherein they had put all their wives and children, having fortified it, as they could, and dammed up all the doors but one, which, though open, was barrocadoed lustily, and in it they had planted two Fawkenets, with som barrels of powder for their defens. <HI>Don Hernando</HI> bee|ing com thither with his men, required those that made good the Church to submit; whereunto they answered with a shot from one of their Guns, which killed a Corporal of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s: where|at his souldiers growing desperate, without any order or com|mand, presently fetched a great quantitie of sprey, or bavins, which they heaped against the other doors, and set fire to them, thinking when the doors were burned down, to enter into the Church. But the fire coming to the barrels and the tubs where|with the doors were barrocadoed on the inside, made such a blaze, that the timber of the Church taking fire therewith, all was immediately of a flame; and the poor people's having no

The Citie made exceeding demonstrations of joie for his coming thither, and forthwith granted him the administration of the Arch-Bisho|prick, according to his desire, as if they had been Popes. In accomplishment whereof, they carried him with great solemni|tie to t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Cathedral Church, and placed him in the Arch-bishop's seat: Which act and form of taking possession beeing past, they gave him monie, and a good quantitie of Church-plate, where|with to paie his souldiers.

<P>THus the confusion and war daily grew more violent in the miserable Kingdoms of <HI>Castilla, Toledo,</HI> the Province of <HI>Alava,</HI> and in the Mountains of <HI>Burgos.</HI> In the Kingdom of <HI>Va|lencia</HI> there was nothing but cutting of throats, and robbing one another: And <HI>Valladolid,</HI> seeing the Kingdom in so distracted a condition, began to murmure against those that sate at the helm, charging them with the ill managing of the affairs, and that they did nothing but trifle and delaie the time, without knowing when or how to set a period to their miseries: They desired to bring their differences to an end, but chiefly by the conquest of the Cavaliers, that they might bee exempted and free'd from such great mischiefs. The fault of not concluding, either by a firm peace, or an open war, they imputed to the Commissioners of the Kingdom; who to enrich themselvs, and becaus they would not bee brought to an account of one hundred and fiftie thou|sand Duckets, which they had received, were glad to keep things from a conclusion; of which <HI>Valladolid</HI> having suffered the most of
<PB N="346" REF="184">
any place, and which had been at the greatest expences, was most sensible, and did exceedingly lament. To say the truth on both sides, as well of the Cavaliers, as of the Commonalties, there was trouble and hard measure enough. In <HI>Montealegre</HI> the Bishop of <HI>Osma,</HI> and the Earl <HI>Don Hernando,</HI> put a great num|ber of the <HI>Toledian</HI> souldiers to t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e rout, beeing there with their Captains, swaggering and rioting, and never suspecting to bee surprised by the Enemie. They killed som of them that made resistance, and carried near two hundred prisoners to <HI>Rioseco.</HI> Thus both parties studied to weaken &amp; ruine each other, and be|twixt them consumed the whole Countrie. <HI>Iohn de Padilla</HI> kept his Court in <HI>Torrelobaton,</HI> like another <HI>Annibal</HI> in <HI>Capua.</HI> Upon a Mundaie, the 8 of <HI>April,</HI> all the people of <HI>Valladolid</HI> rose up in a tumultuous manner, beeing wearied out with those of the <HI>Iunta,</HI> and discontented at their secret and long consultations, without concluding any thing. In this disorder they went seeking them from place to place, beeing fully resolved to turn them out of the Citie, or know of them the reason of their delaies; for the dam|mage which they daily receiv'd from those of <HI>Simancas</HI> was insuf|ferable. There was no trading at all, every thing grew so excessive dear, that a bushel of wheat was worth eight hundred <HI>Maravediz.</HI> The people flocked in multitudes to the great Church, where the Deputies, with the Captains of the Citie, were assembled, with loud voices, and lamentable cries, beseeching them to seek som remedie, for their miserie was insupportable, desiring them moreover, to let them know the reason, why the war was so procrastinated, and urging, that fiftie daies were past without any action of war, neither could their imaginations reach to what they intended. The Officers answered them, That the occasion of those demurres was, the often going to, and coming from <HI>Tordesillas</HI> about the Treatie of Peace with the Cavaliers, bidding them return quietly to their houses, and before night they should know particularly all the circumstances and passages of the business. Whereupon the people praied them to consider well what they did, and not to let them suffer any further detri|ment, or bee burthened vvith any more expences, for vvithin less then seven months they had dis-bursed above one hundred
<PB N="347" REF="184">
thousand and five hundred Duckets, besides other charges and losses, which they had sustained beyond number, yet they did grudg none of all this, if they could close up their miseries with peace, or revenge themselvs by war, and that they might bee permitted to fall upon <HI>Simancas</HI> and <HI>Tordesillas</HI>; for nothing grie|ved them so much, as that they could not have their wills on them. Towards the Evening, the people of every Ward bee|ing called together, they were shewed certain Articles which two Commissioners of the <HI>Iunta</HI> had concluded with the Go|vernors, and brought from <HI>Tordesillas</HI>; the substance of them beeing according to the contents of the General Articles of the Kingdom, specified at large already, I shall spare to trouble the Reader with a second relation.</P>

<P>THe people having perused these Articles, would by no means approve of them, nor consent to any agreement, al|leging, that what the Cavalier promised therein was not suffici|ent, neither was it certain to bee performed, for they had no warrant from his Majestie so especial, as a business of that conse|quence did require; besides, they refused to give any pledges, or deliver any strong holds into the Commonaltie's possession for their securitie. And since the conditions they offered them were neither good nor sure, they would have no Peace, but War with them: in regard they found no securitie of their persons or lives without it. The Commissioners and Captains, seeing all the people fully determined and bent to give the Cavaliers battle, and either live with libertie, or end their miseries with death, (most of them beeing of the same opinion, deeming that to bee their onely safe way) cherish'd them in that resolution, presently giving order to all the people of <HI>Valladolid</HI> to bee in a readiness, all the Artillerie to bee prepared and fitted to carrie into the field: the like was done through all the Cities and Towns of the Com|monaltie, every Commissioner repairing to his own Citie and Town to that purpose: Thus they intended in one daie to end all their troubles, and that this last bout should paie for all their

For those from <HI>Valladolid,</HI> with the two thousand which hee had in <HI>Torrelobaton,</HI> and those which hee exspected hourly from <HI>Salamanca, Toro,</HI> and <HI>Zamora,</HI> (who were six thou|sand Foot, and two hundred lances) besides two thousand five hundred from <HI>Palencia,</HI> fifteen hundred from <HI>Duen~as,</HI> four hun|dred from <HI>Palacios,</HI> and others from the <HI>Beherrias</HI> and <HI>Merindades,</HI> would make him an Armie of fourteen thousand. But those of <HI>Valladolid</HI> were so long before they could bee in fit equipage to march, and the other Tovvns and Cities not sending in their supplies time enough, <HI>Iohn de Padilla</HI> could not execute his design against the Lord high Constable; vvho (as you have heard) took <HI>Vezerril,</HI> and marched into <HI>Rioseco</HI> vvith four thousand Foot, six hundred lances, three or four pieces of Artillerie, &amp;c. So that, through the vveakness and vvant of care of the Commoners Captains, hee soon after set a period to that so miserably conten|tious and destructive War. The Cavaliers on the one partie, and the Cities for the Commonaltie on the other, raised all the force they could possibly for this expedition. The Citie of <HI>Palencia</HI> sent six hundred men and tvvo pieces of Ordnance. <HI>Duen~as</HI> four hundred men and tvvo pieces of Ordnance. <HI>Baltanas de

Cerrato</HI> two hundred. Those of <HI>Segovia, Avila,</HI> and <HI>Leon</HI> came not; <HI>Salamanca</HI> made good the number before mentioned. All these were without any discipline or experience in Martial affairs, and amongst their Officers there was such emulations, every one standing so upon their <HI>punctillio's</HI> of honor, each Captain would bee chief, scorning to receiv orders from any other: In a word, they were ill bred people, possessed with no less igno|rance then unadvisedness&punc; The Merchants, and other Citizens of <HI>Valladolid,</HI> seeing the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">siness brought to the push, and the people resolved to decide <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eir difference with the sword, fearing or doubting the event, ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ied all their goods and Merchandises into Monasteries, having shut up all their ware-houses and shops, and laid all other trading aside, onely for matter of arms, every one providing himself the best hee could. The poorer sort of people beeing ready to starv, made lamentable com|plaints in the streets, crying out to God for mercie, and to releas them out of those calamities, though it were with the loss of their lives. They feared the power of the Cavaliers, who had an Armie of two thousand Lances, and seven thousand Foot, of the choicest men in the Kingdom, all well armed, and in good order, with stout and experienced Officers, under the Com|mand of the Earl of <HI>Haro,</HI> who with great Vigilancie, answe|rable to his Courage, executed the place of Captain General.</P>

Whereupon a certain Priest sitting at the table with him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Priest dissuade's <HI>Iohn de Pa|dilla</HI> from encounter|ing the Ca|valiers.</NOTE> thus said, S^i^r!

Which done, his Armie marched out with all silence possible, and in good order, the Ar|tillerie in the Van, his Foot divided into two squadrons, and hee bringing up the rear with the hors. The Governors and their Captain General soon had intelligence of <HI>Iohn de Padilla's</HI> march, and presently made after him three several waies, whom with|out any great difficultie they took prisoner, and routed all his Armie. The manner of their fight is diversly reported by several Authors, but one (who saie's hee was a spectator thereof) relate's it thus: That upon S^t <HI>George's</HI> daie, the Cavaliers having notice of <HI>Iohn de Padilla's</HI> departure from <HI>Torrelobaton</HI> towards <HI>Toro,</HI> they sallied out upon him from three several places, those of <HI>Tordesillas</HI> charged his Armie in the Van, those of <HI>Medina de Rioseco</HI> in the Rear, and those of <HI>Simancas</HI> falling desperately in upon the Flanks, put all in disorder. The Commoners marched un|til they came neer <HI>Villalar,</HI> in very good order, and the Cavaliers were of several opinions concerning the giving of them battle&punc; Some said it was enough to make them flie, and lose their credits; and that it was wisdom not to put a business of such importance to the hazard of one battle. That their Foot was very nu|merous, and in appearance good: that those which the Lord high Constable brought, were but few and much harassed, be|sides
<PB N="362" REF="187">
if they miscarried in this enterprise, their hopes were all de|stroied with their forces. But the Marquis of <HI>Astorga,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Al|va,</HI> &amp; <HI>Don Diego de Toledo</HI> insisted with much eagerness to charge them, &amp; their voices carrying it against the more timorous partie, they did make after them: Who having great store of excellent hors, &amp; <HI>I. de Padilla's</HI> men being ill disciplin'd, besides the waies being so deep that they could hardly march, &amp; seeing the enemie advance towards them in great bodies several waies, their courage began to fail, yet their Captains animated them all they could. The Cavaliers follow'd them stil in this manner, their hors skirmishing now &amp; then with them, until they came neer <HI>Villalar,</HI> where, having got within shot of them, they let flie their Ordnance amongst their ranks (who march'd very close) w^c^h kill'd them by heaps. This made their hearts fal to their heels, &amp; for hast to get into the town, they ran one over the other, notwithstanding all their officer's en|deavors to keep them in order, &amp; for their further misfortune there fel so fierce a shower of rain, that the Foot stuck fast, engaged in the mire to the very knees, neither could they make any use of their Artillerie, partly by reason of the ill wether, &amp; partly through the baseness of their gunners, the chief wherof nam'd <HI>Saldan~a,</HI> a native of <HI>Toledo</HI> not wel understanding his office, fled awaie, &amp; left the Artillerie in a plowed field.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A private plot of <HI>Don Pedro Mal|donad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'s</HI> with the Earl of <HI>Ve|navente,</HI> to betraie the Artillerie.</NOTE> Although some have reported that <HI>Don Pedro Maldonado</HI> dealt privatly with the gunners, so to engage the Ordnance, that they should do no execution against the Cavaliers, having so promised his Uncle, the Earl of <HI>Venavente,</HI> who had made him sensible of his error. However it was, the Cavaliers seized upon all their Artillerie, and divers of <HI>Iohn de Padilla</HI>'s men both Hors and Foot, saved themselvs by coming to them, having first changed their red crosses into white ones, which was the sign of the Loial Partie. <HI>Iohn de Padilla</HI> expressed a great deal of courage and valour in his own person, and seeing his game quite lost, hee, with five Horsmen more, charged into the Earl of <HI>Venavente</HI>'s troop, and beeing known to bee the General of the other Partie by the richness of his Armor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Notable courage of <HI>Io<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n de Pa|dilla.</HI></NOTE> was presently encountred by <HI>Don Pedro Ba&ccedil;an,</HI> Lord of <HI>Valduerna,</HI> native of <HI>Valladolid. Iohn de Padilla</HI> was in complete Armor, and bore in his hand a Lance all plated with iron, where|with meeting <HI>Don Pedro Ba&ccedil;an</HI> (who was a corpulent heavie

man, and but slightly armed) him hee gave so rude a saluta|tion, that hee was soon unhors't: <HI>Iohn de Padilla</HI> still charged on, crying, <HI>Santjago, Libertad,</HI> (which was the Commoner's word, and the Cavalier's word was, <HI>Santa Maria y Carlos</HI>) at last hee broke his Lan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e to the cost of som of his enemies, after which <HI>Don Alonso de la Cueva</HI> singled him out, and having wounded him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iohn de Pa|dilla</HI> taken prisoner.</NOTE> bade him deliver his Arms, which hee did. Beeing thus a prisoner, <HI>Don Iohn de Ulloa,</HI> a Gentleman of <HI>Toro,</HI> came riding up, and asking who that was, som told him that 'twas <HI>Iohn de Padilla,</HI> whereupon hee gave him a cut over the Bever, and hurt his nose, but not much, for which hee was mightily condemned by all that saw or heard of that ungentleman-like action. So <HI>John de Padilla</HI> was dismounted, and remained Prisoner. <HI>John Bravo,</HI> Captain of the <HI>Segovians</HI> (who would also signalize himself) was likewise taken: and <HI>Francisco Maldonado,</HI> Captain of the <HI>Sa|lamanca</HI> forces, had the like destinie; but his men having all for|saken him, hee was catch't running after them as hard as hee could. The Cavaliers spent all the rest of that daie in woun|ding, killing, and taking, having the pursuit of their enemies two long leagues and a half. Many dying men desired to make their confessions, but there was no bodie would assist them, nor take any compalsion of their condition, which was a la|mentable spectacle, beeing all Christians, friends, and kindred. The Cavaliers beeing masters of the field, stript all both living and dead, sharing the spoil equally amongst themselvs. <HI>John de Padilla</HI> vvould oft bemoan his sad misfortune, saying, If, after the taking of <HI>Torrelobaton,</HI> hee had followed on his victorie, hee should never have been reduced to so deplorable a condition, vvhich vvas very true; for by his staying tvvo months there, the Cavaliers cunningly delaied the time vvith Cessations, until they had so strengthened their Partie, that they over-povvered him. But the All-seeing Providence disposed it othervvise. At first, the Commonalties hearing that their Armie vvas routed, and <HI>John de Padilla</HI> taken, gave out, that it vvas som plot or treacherie of his to lose the battle, laying many other things of this nature to his charge, but they vvere better satisfied of his realitie to their Caus&punc; vvhen they savv hee lost his head for it.</P>

<P>THe next morning betimes, the Governors commanded <HI>Don Pedro de la Cueva</HI> to convoy the prisoners, <HI>Iohn de Padilla, Don Pedro Maldonado, Francisco Maldonado,</HI> &amp; <HI>Iohn Bravo</HI> to the Castle of <HI>Villalva.</HI> While they were preparing to go, <HI>Iohn de Padilla</HI> asked <HI>Don Pedro,</HI> whither hee was commanded to carrie them; who answered him, That for the present they were to go to <HI>Villalva,</HI> whither afterwards hee knew not. Soon after they were sent for thence to <HI>Villalar,</HI> and put into a hous, with a good guard up|on them. The Governors beeing infomed of their arrival there, gave order that <HI>Iohn de Padilla, Iohn Bravo,</HI> and <HI>Don Pedro Maldo|nado</HI> should bee beheaded, and <HI>Francisco Maldonado</HI> carried to the Castle of <HI>Tordesillas</HI>: But as hee was on the waie thither, a mes|senger overtook him from the Governors, who told <HI>Malbaseda,</HI> Lievtenant to <HI>Don Diego Hurtado de Mendo&ccedil;a,</HI> (who had the charge of him) that hee should bring <HI>Francisco Maldonado</HI> back again to execution,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Don Pedro M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ldonado</HI> was s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ved for be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ray|ing the Ar|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">erie.</NOTE> for the Earl of <HI>Venavente</HI> had desired them not to behead <HI>Don Pedro Maldonado</HI> in his presence, beeing his Ne|phew. And becaus it had been divulged, that <HI>Don Pedro Maldo|nado</HI> should bee beheaded, which at the Earl's entreatie was coun|termanded, the Lords had Voted that <HI>Francisco Maldonado</HI> should bee executed in his place. So hee beeing returned, the Gover|nors sent for the <HI>Alcalde</HI> of the Chancerie of <HI>Valladolid,</HI> Comman|ding him to execute Justice upon the persons of <HI>Iohn de Padella, Iohn Bravo,</HI> and <HI>Francisco Maldonado.</HI> The <HI>Alcalde</HI> presently went to the hous where they were prisoners, and bade them prepare themselvs, for the Governors had given order for their executi|ons. <HI>Iohn de Padilla</HI> desired him to send him a learned Priest to confess him, and a Notarie to make his Will, and som witnesses. The <HI>Alcalde</HI> replied, That in the place where they then were, hee could not exspect to finde any men of extraordinarie learning, yet hee would enquire, and if hee could finde one, hee would sa|tisfie his desire therein: but as for a Notarie to make his Will, hee need not trouble himself, for all his goods and estate were Con|fiscate. In the condemnation of these Gentlemen, there was no
<PB N="365" REF="188">
process, nor formal proceeding made, as used to bee in other cri|minal causes, by reason of the evidence of the fact, and the qua|litie of the offence. At last a Priest was sent to them, and <HI>Iohn de Padilla</HI> beeing at Confession, a <HI>Franciscan</HI> Frier came, who was thought an abler man, so <HI>Iohn de Padilla,</HI> and the rest, made use of him. Their Confessions beeing ended, they were brought forth and carried upon Mules to the place of Execution. Before them went a Crier, saying, <HI>This is the Justice which his Majestie, and the Lord High Constable, with the other Governors, do command in his name to bee executed upon the persons of these Gentl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">men, Their command is, that they shall bee beheaded as Traitors, disturbers of the Kingdom, and usurpers of the Roial Crown, &amp;c.</HI> The said <HI>Alcalde Zarate,</HI> and the <HI>Licenciado Cornejo Alcalde de Corte</HI> went along with them to auto|rise the execution of the Justice.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Resolute Answer of <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hn Bra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o.</HI></NOTE> <HI>John Bravo</HI> hearing the Crier saie that they were to suffer for beeing Traitors, hee replied, <HI>Hang|man! thou liest, and those that bid thee saie so, we are no Traitors, but zealous for the publick good, and defendors of the Kingdom's liberties.</HI> Hereupon the <HI>Alcalde Cornejo</HI> bid <HI>John Bravo</HI> hold his peace; whereunto <HI>John Bravo</HI> answered, I know not what, and the <HI>Alcalde</HI> gave him a punch in the breast with his staff, wishing him to consider his present condition, and not affect such vanities. And <HI>John de Padilla</HI> said moreover to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christian admonish|ment of <HI>John de Pa|dilla.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Sen~or John Bravo,</HI> yesterday was the time to fight, and shew your self a valiant Gentleman, this daie to die like a Christian. So the Crier continued his lesson until they came to the place of execution, where being arrived, they all alighted from their Mules to receiv the fatal blow. <HI>John Bravo</HI> beeing first called to execution, they bid him bend and settle himself in a fit posture; hee replied, That they might force him, if they would, and so they did, seizing on him, and stretching him upon a car|pet, which done, the Hangman cut his throat, and would do no more, until the <HI>Alcalde Cornejo</HI> commanded him to cut his head quite off, saying, <HI>Traitors were so to bee used, and their heads to bee set upon the gallows,</HI> which was done accordingly. The next beeing <HI>Io<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n de Padilla</HI>'s turn, hee very willingly prepared himself, and having taken of certain Reliques, which hee wore about his neck, hee gave them to <HI>Don Enrique de Sandoval y Rojas,</HI> (eldest son to the Marquis of <HI>Denia,</HI> who amongst other Gentle|men

A Gentleman of the Loyal Partie, the daie before the battle, wrote a letter to one of the contrarie opinion, telling him, that now the business was brought to such a push, that there was nothing to bee thought on els, but everie one to stand upon his guard, for whosoever fell, should bee sure to bear the ignominious brand of Traitor: As questionless it had been; for wee see all the acti|ons and exploits of this life are more esteemed, and censured by their successes and events, then any other waies. If <HI>Cortes</HI> had not been fortunate in <HI>Mexico,</HI> when hee took <HI>Motezuma,</HI> wee should have said hee had been a rash fool-hardie fellow, but For|tune having crowned his valiant enterprise with success, all men now applaud his gallantrie, giving him the attributes of Coura|gious and Prudent.</P>

<P>TO saie the truth, in all that I have read of <HI>Iohn de Padilla,</HI> I finde him a gallant valerous Gentleman, though hee was engaged in that unfortunate business.

In my judg|ment, if there had been any such passage betwixt him and his

wife, hee would have expressed some discontent or anger in the letter, which hee wrote to her the same daie hee was beheaded: But there was no such thing mentioned in it, quite contrarie, hee expressed therein very much affection and tenderness to her, seeming to bee more sensible of her grief and sorrow for his sad fortune, then of his own suffering.

<P>THe Victorie beeing obteined at <HI>Villalar,</HI> and the Commo|ners Armie quite routed, presently dispatches vvere sent post to the Emperor, giving him account of this good fortune: And the Earl of <HI>Haro,</HI> as Captain General, wrote a particular re|lation to the Emperor of all the passages, vvhich hee receiving at <HI>Bruxels,</HI> the eighth of <HI>Julie,</HI> hee ansvvered, saying, That al|though by other Letters, of the 24 <HI>April,</HI> hee had intelligence of the vanquishing and punishing of those Traitors, (for so hee called them) yet hee vvas better satisfied to receiv it from his hand, thanking him very much for all that hee had done in or|der to his service, and for the affection and zeal vvhich hee expres|sed tovvards him in that emploiment; promising, at his return into that Kingdom, to gratifie him according to the merit of his extraordinarie services; hoping, that by his endeavors hee should finde means to settle the whole Kingdom, which hee particularly encharged him to use all his vigilance and industrie to procure: And chiefly hee recommended to his care the War

of <HI>Navarra,</HI> which was of so great importance, and that hee would assure the Grandees and Gentlemen which had engaged in his service, that at his return hee would gratifie their Loialties according to their qualities and deserts.

Whereupon the most valiant and violent of all the people began to bee crest-fallen: Others that had (as much as they durst) op|posed those past Commotions, seeing the Governors victorious and powerful, declared themselvs. There was no Captain nor Commander left in the Citie. Whereupon to make short, and prevent a Summons, they thought their onely way was, to yield themselvs upon good conditions, which they hoped the Lord Admiral (though much offended) out of compassion and af|fection to that Citie, would grant them. In which resolution they sent som religious men, and persons of respect, with much submission and humble acknowledgment of their faults, to de|sire mercie and pardon of the Lord Admiral: Who at first shewed himself very much displeased and unwilling to hearken to their desires, saying, Hee ought, and would make an example aswel of the principal offendors, as of the Common people. The Souldiers, who exspected notable plunder, their fin|gers itching to measure out the silks and velvets with their Pikes, (as they bragg'd they would) were mad becaus the word of command, To fall on and enter the Citie, was so long a giving out; which the Inhabitants knowing, every one secured their commodities the best they could. But by God's help, and the indulgence of the Governors, a Peace and pardon was con|cluded and proclaimed in the market places and streets of <HI>Vallado|lid,</HI> with great acclamations of joie, and sound of Trumpets,

<P>THe Emperor beeing desirous to express the Contentment which hee received by the Pacification of his Kingdoms, and that hee might shew himself a gracious Prince to those that had offended his Majestie in so high a measure, hee comman|ded that two daies after the general pardon was proclaimed, there should bee great Feasts celebrated in <HI>Valladolid,</HI> with great solemnitie, with Tiltings, fighting on hors-back with Bulls, and a Turnament or Just-Royal. And the Emperor himself beeing in compleat Armor, and so disguised, that no bodie could know him, entered the List, and brake several Lances with those that had gotten the greatest honor that daie, behaving himself with such dexteritie, courage, and gallantrie, that hee drew the eies of all the Spectators upon him, and kindled a curiositie in their brests to know who hee was, which beeing discovered, their gusts increased with their admirations. Light-winged Fame having filled the World with the Emperor's good success, many Princes and Embassadors, from all parts, thereupon came flocking to his Court. The King of <HI>England</HI> sent his Embassadors, and <HI>Don Luis de Silva,</HI> in the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> his Master's name, came to congratulate his Majestie's return, his reception of the Imperial Crown, and the pacification of the troubles in <HI>Spain,</HI> desiring moreover, that hee would give order that the <HI>Castillians</HI> might go no more into the <HI>Moluccas,</HI> which his Majestie remitted to bee determined by judicious and experienced men.</P>

<P>HIs Majestie's goodness and clemencie to his Subjects, had it been in the antient Greek's or Latine's ages, should have been celebrated with a never dying memorie, since of so many offendors so few were excepted in the general Pardon, and well
<PB N="381" REF="196">
near all those too obteined an exemption from all punishments, aswel of Persons, as Estate: And the Nobles were restored to the same height of honor and esteem as they possessed formerly, the Emperor shewing as much favor and liberalitie towards them and their children, as if they never had committed any offence against him. Whosoever take's the pains to peruse the historie of these fore-related Commotions will finde, that <HI>Her|nando de Avalos,</HI> a Gentleman of <HI>Toledo,</HI> was one of the greatest sticklers for the Commonalties, one of the chief Ring-leaders of these disorders, and one that persevered in them with as great obstinacie and perversness as might bee; for which hee was ex|cepted, yet nothing was done to him. But whether out of fear, or otherwise, hee privately slunk away out of the Kingdom; for which the Emperor (as hee had reason) was the more displeased at him. And having continued in this voluntarie exile some time, at last having disguised himself, as hee thought, sufficiently, hee took the boldness to return to the Court and en|deavor to procure his pardon, which coming to the knowledg of one that was neer his Majesties person, hee thinking to do an acceptable piece of service, went presently and told the Emperor, that <HI>Hernando de Avalos</HI> was in the Court, and that, if his Majestie was so pleased, hee would apprehend him, for hee knew where to finde him. The Emperor took no great notice hereof at the first time. Two or three daies after, the Gentleman think|ing his Majestie had not well understood him, or els had for|gotten what hee had told him, gave him a second advice of <HI>Her|nando's</HI> beeing there. Whereunto the Emperor with a counte|nance that express'd no great pleasure in any such like actions, answered; Thou should'st have done better to have advised <HI>Hernando de Avalos</HI> to leav the Court, then to press mee to give command to have him apprehended. So the pick-thank re|mained ashamed and confounded, (as all those which delight in such base unworthie offices for the most part are, when their malicious practises do not take effect). It is moreover re|ported, the testimonie of the goodness of this Emperor, that beeing told hovv fevv had been executed of those offendors, hee replyed, It is enough, let there bee no

<P>THe general pardon beeing known through all <HI>Spain,</HI> the hearts of all the people were filled with no less rejoycing then affection to their Prince, having such notable experience of his clemencie and valour, and thenceforwards the Peace and quietness grew daily more and more in the Kingdom. Those of <HI>Valencia</HI> hearing what his Majestie had done at <HI>Valladolid</HI> for the Kingdom of <HI>Castilla,</HI> presently sent their Commissioners, humbly craving the same grace and favor from the Emperor, and in particular they desired his Majestie would bee pleased to re|move thence their Vice-Roy <HI>Don Diego de Mendo&ccedil;a,</HI> whom they abhorred exceedingly, deriving upon him all the fault of their past Commotions, by reason of the many Tyrannies and oppres|sions wherewith hee had overburthened the people. But those Commissioners not coming in the name and with a general power from the whole Kingdom, their desires were not granted at that time. Whereupon the 12 of <HI>November, Anno</HI> 1522, four other Commissioners were sent with full power, from the Kingdom of <HI>Valencia,</HI> to tender, without reserv, into his Ma|jestie's hands all their honors, lives, and fortunes, that hee might dispose of them at his will and pleasure, absolutely re|signing themselvs to his clemencie, and desiring onely that hee would give them another Vice-Roy, for they could not endure <HI>Don Diego de Mendo&ccedil;a,</HI> and that hee would change som other Of|ficers; Which the Emperor, to satisfie them, did, placing in <HI>Don Diego</HI>'s stead, the Queen <HI>Germana,</HI> and making <HI>Don Iohn,</HI> Marquis of <HI>Brandeburg,</HI> her husband, Captain General of the whole Kingdom, who died in the same year. After which, the Emperor considering the fidelitie and Roial descent of <HI>Don Her|nando de Aragon,</HI> Duke of <HI>Calatria,</HI> (who beeing a prisoner in the Castle of <HI>Xativa</HI>) in the time of Troubles the People would have set him at libertie, and made him their Captain General, and married him to the Queen, but hee discreetly refused their

offer, saying, That hee would not go out of prison without the Emperor's consent) sent for him to <HI>Valladolid,</HI> where hee did him great honor and respect, and having married him to the Queen <HI>Germana,</HI> (who was second wife to the Catholick King <HI>Don Fernando</HI>) invested them in the Government of the King|dom of <HI>Valencia.</HI></P>

But the Spring following, they took the field again, and marched near fortie thousand strong toward <HI>Paris,</HI> spoiling and burning without mercie as they went, which put the <HI>Parisians</HI> to a terrible fright.

Hee continued a Prisoner a year and upwards, af|ter which time, hee was released upon Articles betwixt him and the Emperor, whereof one principal was, That hee should mar|rie the Emperor's sister, <HI>Don~a Leonor,</HI> widow to <HI>Don Manuel</HI> King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and restore the Dukedom of <HI>Burgundie</HI> to the Hous of <HI>Austria,</HI> for performance of their agreement, his two eldest sons,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Francis</HI> the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rst ex|chang'd for his two sons.</NOTE> <HI>viz Francis</HI> the <HI>Dolfin,</HI> and <HI>Henrie</HI> Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> were, at the same time as hee was set into <HI>France,</HI> delivered as Pledges to the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> But beeing in his own Countrie, whether by persuasion of ill Counsellors, or, thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">king the conditions too unreasonable, and hee not obliged to make good his promise, having been forced thereunto in his imprisonment, hee sent the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> to the Emperors Court, requiring him (in regard it was not in his power to give away any part of his Countrie) that hee would give his children their enlarge|ment upon any reasonable ransom. Which Embassage the Emperor, with great indignation, answered thus briefly; That if the King of <HI>France</HI> could not perform the conditions (as hee pretended) yet desired to have his Sons at libertie; hee should com back and take their places, (which was in his power to do, and hee had promised by oath) otherwise, hee must not ex|spect to have his children so soon released.
