<L>MY Lord, 'tis thought the world was but a plain</L>

<L>In idleness, the Nurse of Ignorance;</L>
<L>Which lulls mens braines, in a Lethergean Trance;</L>
<L>At th' last <HI>Necessity</HI> seem'd to infuse</L>
<L>In them the Art of Arthitect, the use</L>
<L>Of Huts and Houses; every one began</L>
<L>To shew himself or more, or lesse a Man.</L>
<L>Left their wilde kinde of living, and did build</L>
<L>Cities for safety, in the which they held,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="7">A Civiliz'd comunication, each</L>
<L>By a Divine instinct the Arts did teach;</L>
<L>Nor did they perish when the World was drown'd</L>
<L>Their Hyrogliphicks were in pillars found,</L>
<L>That by degrees succeeding ages did</L>
<L>Reveale to one another secrets hid;</L>
<L>Which though before were seeds in them, yet they</L>
<L>Shew'd not untill Experience taught the way.</L>
<L>Then did the Navigator search the Mayne,</L>
<L><HI>How</HI> to steere forth, how to return again</L>
<L>With prize and safety? straight that art was hurld,</L>
<L>Into our lap, the center of the World,</L>
<L>By divine hand; that we in a short time,</L>
<L>Made our selves countrymen of every clymb,</L>
<L>Searching the spacious Universe, our skill,</L>
<L>And courage did the mouth of wonder fill,</L>
<L>Riding on dangers neck, as though t'were meant,</L>
<L>We should be Lords of the whole Continent.</L>
<L>Such were our darings, that, what, Histories</L>
<L>Forget to speak of our discoveries.</L>
<L><HI>Greenland, Lapland, Michar, Isles</HI> remote</L>
<L>And many more, which later times denote,</L>
