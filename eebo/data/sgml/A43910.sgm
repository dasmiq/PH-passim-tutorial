<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF SIR EGER Sir Grahame, and Sir Gray-steel.</HEAD>
<L>INto the Kinrick of Bealm,</L>
<L>There winn'd a Lord of that Realm:</L>
<L>He was the greatest of renown,</L>
<L>Except the King that wore the Crown.</L>
<L>His name was Earl Diges,</L>
<L>And his Lady Dame Biges:</L>
<L>And his Daugh'er Winliane,</L>
<L>Husband would she never have nane,</L>
<L>Neither for gold nor yet for good,</L>
<L>Nor yet for highness of his blood,</L>
<L>But only he that through swords dint,</L>
<L>That ever wan and never tint.</L>
<L>Als there was men in that Kinrick,</L>
<L>Many one, but very few sik,</L>
<L>They sought far off her for to fang,</L>
<L>And she was maiden wonder lang.</L>
<L>Her Father had a noble rout</L>
<L>Of bold Knights strong and stout:</L>
<L>But in that Court there was a Knight,</L>
<L>An hardy man both good and wight,</L>
<L>They called him Sir Eger,</L>
<L>And he was but a Batcheler:</L>
<L>His eldest brother was livand,</L>
<L>And brooked all his fathers land,</L>
<L>Yet was he courteously taught,</L>
<L>And he sought battels far, and fought,</L>
<L>And conquered the honour,</L>
<L>With weapons and with armour:</L>
<L>Both in battels and in fight:</L>
<L>While on a time that she him heght,</L>
<L>And she granted him her good-will,</L>
<L>Her Father assented soon theretill,</L>
<L>Her friends were fain that she would</L>
<L>Once in her heart it for to hold.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="2">That she would have to her a pier,</L>

<L>Ye grieve you more then mister were,</L>
<L>Is none seemly in his weed,</L>
<L>To prove his man-hood on a steed,</L>

<L>Why should his man-hood be reproved?</L>
<L>Or yet his Ladyes love to tine.</L>
<L>Sir Eger said, let be Sir Grahame.</L>
<L>I rode aventures for to see,</L>

<L>Weapons and steed thereto,</L>

<L>I saw no man, so God me reed,</L>

<L>Neither of heart nor yet of hand,</L>

<L>Weapons, for they will stand in stead,</L>

<L>I took my leave and forth I fure,</L>

<L>That he had teached me full right,</L>
<L>And understood which was the Land.</L>
<L>A Forrest lay on every hand,</L>
<L>A River that was deep and wide,</L>
<L>I found no entress at a side:</L>
<L>Unto a Foord, and over I rode,</L>

<L>He crap together, &amp; would have run,</L>
<L>I hearkned where that din should come:</L>
<L>I looked a little me before,</L>
<L>I saw a knight ride on a sore:</L>
<L>With red shield, and red spear,</L>
<L>And all of red shined his gear,</L>
<L>He rode upon a sturdie s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eed,</L>

<L>His spear again to him he drew,</L>
<L>He mist my self, my steed he slew:</L>
<L>Then lighted I deliverlie,</L>
<L>But not so soon ready was he,</L>
<L>Ere ever I might my good sword weild,</L>
<L>Again he strake me in the shield.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="4">Through force of him and of his steed,</L>
<L>He bare me down, and over me yeed.</L>
<L>And then on foot I started soon,</L>

<L>The great defoul my self had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ane,</L>
<L>And even as he by me out drew,</L>

<L>To counter on foot he was full thra,</L>

<L>He drew a sword, a worthie weapon,</L>
<L>The first dint on me could happen:</L>

<L>Then I him hit upon the crown,</L>
<L>A cantil of his helm dang down:</L>
<L>And for that strake I would not let,</L>
<L>Another upon him soon I set:</L>
<L>Upon his breast with a fell braid,</L>
<L>At the ground I thought he had been laid:</L>
<L>Also I thought well he had gotten,</L>
<L>But at that strake my sword was broken,</L>
<L>I drew a knife, I had none other,</L>

<L>And with mine hef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> behind the hand,</L>

<L>While there came blood through the steel,</L>

<L>And with mine hands I could them wail,</L>
<L>A truncheon of mine own spear,</L>
<L>Me thought it heavie for to bear:</L>
<L>Of a sadled horse I got a sight:</L>
<L>He was right lean but he was wight</L>
<L>He had gone bridled dayes nine,</L>

<L><PB N="8" REF="5">When day was gone, and come was night,</L>

<L>That ever I saw since born was I,</L>
<L>I lean'd me on my sadle to rest,</L>
<L>Bethinking me what was the best.</L>
<L>For I had need some me to mend,</L>
<L>And I was loath for to be kend:</L>
<L>I had been but a short while there,</L>
<L>When that a woman sweet and fair,</L>
<L>Came walking from the harber green,</L>
<L>And at the bour she would have been:</L>
<L>She stinted when she could me see,</L>
<L>A Lady seemed she to be.</L>
<L>And in scarlet she was clad,</L>
<L>And all the weed that she on had,</L>
<L>In red gold could it birn,</L>
<L>And rich pearles set therein.</L>
<L>It seem d to me by her parrage,</L>
<L>She was a Lady of great linage:</L>
<L>And though that I had bled my blood,</L>
<L>Yet still upon my feet I stood.</L>
<L>And she discribed me full right,</L>
<L>And hailsed me then as a knight.</L>
<L>Right as a knight she hailsed me,</L>
<L>And I her in the same degree:</L>
<L>Sir, she said, by mine intent,</L>
<L>Ye have need of better easement.</L>
<L>And here beside there is an hall,</L>
<L>A little space under the wall,</L>

<L>Thereto the kindest Lord at will:</L>
<L>Since I am the first that with you met,</L>

<L>Then said I to the Lady fair,</L>
<L>I would not be in such repair.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="5">But I require you it ye might,</L>

<L>A lawer they have gotten soon,</L>
<L>Warm water into it was done,</L>
<L>And in a silver basen</L>
<L>Her own hands washed mine een:</L>
<L>And when she saw mine hands bare,</L>
<L>Then waxt mine anger far the mare,</L>
<L>My glove was haile, my finger was tint,</L>
<L>She might well know it was no dint:</L>
<L>For Gray-steel he was of such pride,</L>
<L>And his word waxed ay so wide,</L>
<L>Of what countrey that he was commin,</L>
<L>She might wit well I was overcommin.</L>
<L>She perceived that I thought shame,</L>
<L>She asked not what was my name,</L>
<L>Or of what countrey I was come,</L>
<L>Into what place, or in what room:</L>
<L>Or of what countrey that I were,</L>
<L>But eased me in all manner.</L>
<L>Such drink then as she gave me there,</L>

<L>What countenance ever she made,</L>
<L>Some heavy thing in heart she had.</L>

<L>Sir Grahame ceased not, nor would blin,</L>

<L>He speaks not, what ever they say,</L>

<L>He said, yestreen when he came home,</L>
<L>His tongue was not all from him gone,</L>

<L>The field he took against all tha:</L>

<L>And with that he was wounded so,</L>
<L>That scarcelie he might ride or go.</L>
<L>An horse of theirs then by him stood,</L>
<L>Like to his own, but not so good,</L>

<L>The Countess mourns for sir Eger,</L>

<L>Sir Pallias his own brother,</L>

<L>Sir Grahame was nothing of his kin,</L>

<L>But it was more then dayes three,</L>

<L>To him she made small courtesie:</L>
<L>UUhen she came to the chamber within,</L>
<L>Little company made to him,</L>
<L>Sir Eger might not one word speak,</L>
<L>Sir Grahame before the bed could sit,</L>
<L>And to sir Grahame said she than,</L>
<L>Sir, how doth your sore wounded man,</L>

<L>Said, not so well as mister were:</L>

<L>The Lady said, so have I feel,</L>
<L>I might have thold he had done well,</L>

<L>Sir Eger asked where he lay.</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="10">Then meekly said the Lady free</L>
<L>To sir Eger, Now how do ye?</L>
<L>I rede you be of counsel clean,</L>
<L>Ye will not cose, Sir, as I ween.</L>
<L>I think your love be in no weer,</L>
<L>Therefore I rede you make good chear.</L>
<L>Sir Eger said, My chear well is,</L>
<L>But even as I may with this,</L>

<L>I will not mend suppose I mean.</L>
<L>Then said the Lady, Certes nay,</L>

<L>She no more tidings did refrain,</L>

<L>Then Sir Grahame stood before the door,</L>
<L>And held the Lady on the floor,</L>

<L>Sir, This the Lady telleth me,</L>
<L>What makes her biding to delay,</L>
<L>And why she goes so soon away.</L>
<L>She was forbidden by the leech,</L>
<L>And also by her fathers speech,</L>
<L>And the first night that ye came home,</L>
<L>So great a sorrow hath she tane,</L>
<L>That she hath been as sick as ye,</L>
<L>And thus his fellow comfort he</L>
<L>Eleven weeks, as I heard say,</L>
<L>Sir Eger there in leeching lay,</L>
<L>And seldom came the fair Lady,</L>
<L>But when she came, she was right dry.</L>
<L>Her drieness and als here strange fare.</L>
<L>Sir Grahame then said to sir Eger,</L>
<L>That she durst not otherwise do,</L>
<L>Nor yet in presence come him to:</L>

<L>He is a man that is well kend,</L>

<L>I cannot treat him for to bide,</L>

<L>The Earl bethought him on a thing,</L>
<L>How this young Lord, sir Garrentine,</L>

<L>Was brought to dead upon a bear,</L>

<L>The Lady said, so God me speed,</L>
<L>It is a quarter of a year,</L>
<L>Sen that time that a knight came here,</L>
<L>Right sore wounded with sword and knife,</L>

<L>He was a ventrous Knight of weer:</L>
<L>And he had met with sir Gray-steel,</L>
<L>As many did, and he might feel.</L>
<L>When I had seen that of the knight,</L>
<L>I held him in my bower all night,</L>
<L>Dispoyled him of all his gear,</L>
<L>Then the most wound that did him dear,</L>
<L>My stones of vertue stemd the blood,</L>
<L>I made him salve both fine and good,</L>

<L>And laid him down, and could him keep,</L>
<L>And in the dawning of the day,</L>
<L>He bowned him, and made his way.</L>
<L>Fra that he would no longer bide,</L>
<L>Another salve to him I made,</L>

<L>I heard him say that came him fro,</L>

<L>The Earl said to the Lady bright,</L>
<L>When heard ye tidings of the knight?</L>
<L>From him the streen there came another,</L>

<L>And courteously he asked tythance,</L>

<L>The Earl he would no longer stand,</L>
<L>But took the Countess by the hand.</L>
<L>The Lady was as white as Swan,</L>

<L>The knight before the Chimney stood,</L>

<L>Sir Eger came into that time,</L>

<L>The knight lay still, and spake no more,</L>
