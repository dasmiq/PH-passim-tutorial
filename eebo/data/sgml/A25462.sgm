<P><HI>YET</HI> as there is a secret digested Art by the wisdom of the Spirit, in the compileing of that sacred Record in general; so there may be avowed a hidden connexion, even of these words, to the former: for His assertion of His coming down from Heaven, implieth evidently His being there, and that He was there, He proves by His Descending thence; which words when the Jews were offended at, to enstall their admiration, and heighten their wondering. He proposeth His <HI>What and if,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
