<HEAD TYPE="sub">King Charles the second, his Promises and Decla|rations
for the Liberty of tender Consciences.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IN the Kings Letter from</HI> Bredah, <HI>that was sent to the House
of Peers, and read in the House, May the 1st. 1660. and
which Letter was ordered by the Lords in Parliament assem|bled,
that it should be forthwith printed and published for
the service of the House, and satisfaction of the Kingdoms;
it is said in the Book of Collections of the Kings Speeches, Page
8, and</HI> 9. And because the passion and uncharitableness of the times
have produced several Opinions in Religion, by which men are engaged
in Parties and Animosities against each other; which when they shall
hereafter unite in a freedom of Conversation, will be composed, or better
understood. We do declare a liberty to tender Consciences, and that no
man shall be disquieted or called in question for differences in Opinion in
matters of Religion, which do not disturb the Peace of the Kingdom;
and that we shall be ready to consent to such an Act of Parliament, as
upon Mature deliberation, shall be offered to us for the full granting
that Indulgence.</P>
<P><HI>And in the Kings Declaration, concering Ecclesiastical Af|fairs,
which was dated October the 25th, 1160. it is said,</HI>
In a word we do again renew what we have formerly said, in our Declara|tion
from <HI>Bredah,</HI> for the liberty of tender Consciences, <Q>That no
<PB N="4" REF="3">
man shall be disquieted, or called in question for differences of O|pinion
in matters of Religion, which do not disturb the Peace of the
Kingdom; and if any have been disturbed in that kind, since our
arival here, it hath not proceeded from any direction of ours. <HI>And
it is said,</HI> We do in the first place declare, Our Purpose and Resolu|tion
is, and shall be, to promote the <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>Godlines,</HI> and to
encourage the Exercise of <HI>Religion,</HI> both in publique and private.
<HI>And in the same Declaration it is said,</HI> our present Considera|tion
and work is, To gratifie the private Consciences of those who are
grieved with the use of some Ceremonies, by indulging to, and dis|pensing
with the omitting these Ceremonies.</Q></P>
<P><HI>In the Kings Speech to both houses of Parliament, the 8th of
July,</HI> 1661. It is to put my self in mind, as well as you, That I
so often (<HI>I</HI> think so often as <HI>I</HI> come to you) mention to you my Decla|ration
from <HI>Bredah;</HI> And let me put you in mind of another Decla|ration,
published by your selves about the same time, and which <HI>I</HI> am
perswaded made mine the more effectual; An Honest, Generous, and
Christian Declaration, signed by the most eminent Persons, who had
been the most eminent Sufferers; in which you renounced all former
Animosities, and memory of former Vnkindnesses. And my Lords
and Gentlemen, let it be in no mans power to chargeme, or you, with the
breach of our Words or Promises, which can never be a good Ingredi|ent
to our future security.</P>
<P>And in the Chancellors Speech to both Houses, May the 8th,
1661. It is said, <HI>He told you, but now</HI> (meaning the King) <HI>that
he vallued himself much, upon keeping his word, upon performing all
that he promiseth to his People.</HI></P>
<P>And also in the Kings discourse with <HI>Richard Hubberthorn,</HI>
soon after he arrived in <HI>England,</HI> he said, <HI>Well, of this you may
be assured, That you shall none of you suffer for your</HI> Opinions <HI>or</HI> Re|ligion,
<HI>so long as you live peaceably, and you have the</HI> Word <HI>of a</HI>
King <HI>for it; and I also have given forth a Declaration to the same pur|pose,
That none shall Wrong you, or Abuse you.</HI></P>
<P>And further in the Kings Declaration, dated <HI>Decem.</HI> 26. 1662.
wherein he declares, first, his wonderful Restoration without the
least blood-shed by the <HI>Military Sword.</HI></P>
<P>And he expresseth his Clemency, or the Clemency of his
Nature.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="3">
And he vindicates himself from divers suggestions, of dis|affected
Persons, particularly from that, of intending to sub|ject
Persons and Estates to revenge or spoil, &amp;c. and from
intending to introduce a <HI>Miliary</HI> or <HI>Arbitrary</HI> way of Go|vernment.</P>
<P>Also he expresseth these words, <HI>as a malicious Scandal (viz.)</HI>
<Q>That having made use of such solemn Promises from <HI>Bredah,</HI>
and in several Declarations since, of ease and liberty to tender
Consciences, instead of performing any part of them, we
have added streighter Fetters then ever.</Q></P>
<P>And further adds, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>We find it as artificially, as maliciously
divulged throughout the whole Kingdom, that at the same
time we deny a fitting Liberty to those other Sects of our
Subjects, whose Consciences will not allow them to conform
to the Religion ectablished; We are highly indulgent to
<HI>Papists,</HI> even to such a degree of countenance as may even
endanger the <HI>Protestant</HI> Religion.</Q></P>
<P>These, and such like, in the said Declaration are related as
venemous Insinuations, most false and malicious Scandals,
wicked and malicious Suggestions, and the Fomenters of them,
as the most dangerous Enemies of his Crown and of the Peace
and Happiness of the Nation.</P>
<P>And these words are further added, <HI>(viz.)</HI> <Q>It having been
alwayes a constant profession of ours, That we do, and shall
ever think our royal dignity and greatness much more hap|pily
and securely founded on our own Clemency, and our
Subjects Loves, then in their Fears and our Power.</Q></P>
<Q><P>To give our People a Testimony of our founding all our
security, rather in their affections, then in any Military Pow|er;
the sole strength and security, we shall ever confide in,
shall be the hearts and affections of our Subjects indeared and
confirmed to us by our <HI>Gratious</HI> and <HI>Steady</HI> manner of <HI>Govern|ment,</HI>
according to the antient known <HI>Laws</HI> of the Land, there
being not any one of our Subjects, who doth more from his
heart abhor (then we our selves) all sorts of <HI>Military</HI> and
<HI>Arbitrary</HI> Rule.</P>
<P>As concerning the non performance of our Promises; we
remember well the very words of those from <HI>Bredah, (viz.)</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="4">
We do declare a liberty to tender Consciences, and that no
man shall be disquieted, or called in question for diffe|rences
of Opinion in matters of Religion, which do not
disturb the Peace of the Kingdom; and that we shall be
ready to consent to such an Act of Parliament, as upon
Mature deliberation shall be offered to us, for the full grant|ing
that Indulgence. We remember well the Confirma|tions,
we have made of them since upon several occasions in
Parliament; and as all these things are still fresh in our me|mory,
so are we still firm in the Resolution of performing
them to the full.</P>
<P>We do conceive our selves so far engaged, both in ho|nour,
and in what we owe to the Peace of our Dominions,
which we profess we can never think secure, whilst there
shall be a colour left to the disaffected, to inflame the
minds of so many Multitudes, upon the scores of Consci|ences,
with dispair of ever obtaining any effect of our Pro|mises
for their ease.</P>
<P>Such an Act, as in pursuance of our Promises the wisdom
of our Parliament shall think fit to offer unto us for the ease
of tender Consciences.</P>
<P>We profess it would be grievous unto us to consent,
to the putting any of our Subjects to death for their Opi|nions
in matter of <HI>Religion</HI> only.</P>
<P>Our expressing according to Christian Charity, Our dislike
of Blood-shed for Religion only.</P>
<P>Our Parliament is an Assembly so eminent in their Loyalty
and their Zeal, for the Peace and Prosperity of our King|domes
&mdash;can no wayes be doubted in the performance of all
our Promises, and to the effecting all those gracious inten|tions,
which God knows our heart is full of, for the
PLENTY, PROSPERITY, and UNIVERSAL
SATISFACTION of the NATION.</P>
<P>We think to give them the most important Marks of our
care: First, In punishing by severe Laws that Licentiousness
and Impiety, which we find to our great grief, hath overspread
the Nation.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="4">
And lastly so to improve the good consequence&mdash;to the ad|vancement
of trade, that all our Subject finding the advan|tage
&mdash;in that prime foundation of plenty, they may all, with
minds happily composed by our clemency and indulgence
(instead of taking up thoughts of deserting their profes|sions)
apply themselves comfortably, and with redoubled
industry to their several vocations, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Also in the Votes and Advice of the House of Commons,
<HI>Febr.</HI> 5. 1662. Upon reading the Kings Declaration and
Speech, are these words, <HI>(viz.)</HI> And our hearts are further
enlarged in these returns of Thanks-giving when we consider
your Majesties most Princely, and Heroick professions of rely|ing
upon the affections of your People, AND ABHOR|ING
ALL SORTS OF MILITARY AND
ARBITRARY RULE, &amp;c.</P></Q>

<HEAD>SECT. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Here follows some remarkable Observations, col|lected
out of a Book, entituled, <GAP DESC="foreign">,
A Discourse of the Liberty of
Prophesying; shewing the unreasonableness of
prescribing to other mens Faith, and the Ini|quity
of persecuting different Opinions; by
Ier. Tayler D. D. (so stiled) Chaplin in Or|dinary
to his late Majesty.</HEAD>
<P>IN his Epistle Dedicatory are these words: <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>As con|trary
as <HI>Cruelty</HI> is to <HI>Mercy,</HI> as <HI>Tyranny</HI> to <HI>Charity;</HI> so is
<HI>War</HI> and <HI>Bloodshed</HI> to the <HI>Meekness</HI> and <HI>Gentleness</HI> of <HI>Christian
Religion.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And further speaks, to dispute men into Mercies, Compli|ances
and Tollerations mutual; and further adds.</P>
<Q><P>I designed a Discourse to this purpose, with as much gree|diness,
as if I had thought it possible with my Arguments
to have perswaded the rough and hard handed Souldiers to
have disbanded presently; for I had often thought of the
Prophesie, that in the Gospel, our Swords should be turned
into Plow-shares, and our Spears into Pruning-hooks.</P><P>I thought it my duty to plead for Peace and Charity, and
Forgiveness, and <HI>Permissions</HI> mutual.</P>
<P>Although we must contend earnestly for the Faith, yet this
contention must be with Arms fit for the Christian Warfare,
the Sword of the Spirit, the Shield of Faith, &amp;c. but not with
other Arms; for a Church-man must not be a Striker, for the
Weapons of our Warfare are not Carnal, but Spiritual.</P>
<P>I being most of all troubled, that men should be persecuted,
and afflicted, for disagreeing in such opinions, which they
<PB N="9" REF="5">
cannot with sufficient grounds obtrude upon others necessarily,
because they cannot propound them infallibly.</P>
<P>Considerations (are to be had) to the Persons of men, and
to the Laws of Charity more then to the trimmphing in any
Opinion, &amp;c.</P>
<P>If the Persons be Christians in their life, and Christians in
their profession; if they acknowledge the Eternal Son of
God for their Master, and the Lord, and live in all relations
as becomes Persons making such professions, why then
should I hate such Persons whom God loves, and who love
God, who are partakers of Christ, and Christ hath a Ti|tle
to them, who dwell in Christ, and Christ in them, because
their understandings have not been brought up like mine,
have not had the same Masters, they have not met with the
same Books&mdash;have not the same Opinions that I have, and
do not determine their School Questions to the same sence of
my Sect or Interest?</P>
<P>And whatsoever is against the Foundation of Faith or con|trary
to good Life&mdash;or distructive to humane society&mdash;is
out of the limits of my Question, and doth not pretend to
compliance or tolleration.</P>
<P>The fault I find and seek to remedy is, That men are so dog|matical
and resolute in their Opinions, and impatient of others
disagreeing in those things wherein is no sufficient means of
Union and Determination, but that men should let Opinions
and Problems not be obtruded as Actions, nor Questions in
the vast collection of the Systeme of divinity be adopted into
the Family of Faith.</P>
<P>3. Its hard to say, that he who would not have men put to
death or punished corporally for such things, for which no
humane authority is sufficient for Cognizance, or Deter|mination,
or competent for infliction; that he perswades to
an indifferency when he refers to another Judicatory, which
is competent, sufficient, infallable, just, and highly severe&mdash;for
God alone must be Judge of these matters, who alone is
Master of our Souls, and hath the Dominion over humane
understanding&mdash;God alone is Judge of erring Persons.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="6">
I earnestly contend, that another mans Opinion shall be
no Rule to mine, and that my Opinion shall be no Snare and
Prejudice to my self; that men use one another so charitably,
that no error or violence tempt men to <HI>Hypocrisie,</HI> this very
thing being one of the Arguments I used to perswade Permis|sions,
lest Compulsion introduce Hypocrisie, and make Since|rity
troublesom, &amp;c.</P>
<P>From the Dictates of holy Scripture, it is observable, that
this, with its appendant degrees, I mean, restraint of Prophe|sying,
imposing upon other mens understandings, being Ma|sters
of their Consciences, and lording it over their Faith,
came in with the retinue and train of Antichrist, as other abu|ses
and corruptions of the Church did, by reason of the ini|quity
of the times, and the cooling of the first heats of
Christianity, and the encrease of interest, and the abatements
of Christian simplicity, when the Churches fortune grew bet|ter,
and her Sons grew worse, and some of her Fathers worst
of all: For in the first three hundred Years there was no sign
of persecuting any man for his Opinion, though at that time
there were very horrid Opinions commenced&mdash;and they who
used all means&mdash;Christian and Spiritual, for their disim|provement
and convi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">tion, thought not of using corporal force
&mdash;and therefore I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> not only urge their not doing it, as an
Argument of the unlawfulness of such proceeding, but their
defying it, and speaking against such practises as unreasonable,
and destructive to Christianity, for so <HI>Tertullian</HI> is express,
<HI>Humani juris &amp; naturalis potestatis uni cuique quod putaverit colere,
sed nec religionis est cogere religionem quae suscipi debet sponte non vi:</HI>
its of humane right and natural power for every one to wor|ship
what he thinks; but neither is it the part of Religion to
compel Religion, which ought to be undertaken of its own
accord.</P>
<P><HI>The same is the Doctrine of</HI> Cyprian, Lactantius, Hillary,
Minutius, Faelix, Sulpitius, Severus, Chrisostom, Hierom,
Austin, Damascen, Theophilact, Socrates Scholasticus, <HI>and</HI>
Bernard.</P>
<P>All wise Princes till they were over-born with Faction, and
<PB N="11" REF="6">
solicited by peevish persons, gave Tolleration to differ|ing
Sects&mdash;But at first there were some heretical persons,
that were so impatient, they were the men that first in|treated
the Emperor to persecute the Catholicks: but till
four hundred years after Christ, no Catholick persons, or
very few, did provoke the secular Arm, or implore its aid
against the Hereticks; save only that <HI>Arrius</HI> behaved himself
so seditiously and tumultuarily, that the <HI>Nicene</HI> Fathers pro|cured
a temporary Decree for his relegation; but it was soon
taken off, and God left to be his Judge.</P>
<P>But as the Ages grew worse, so men grew more cruel and
unchristian; and in the Greek Church <HI>Atticus</HI> and <HI>Nestorius</HI>
of <HI>Constantinople, Theodocius</HI> of <HI>Synoda,</HI> and some few others,
who had forgotten the mercies of their great Master, and their
own duty, grew implacable, and furious, and impatient of con|tradiction.</P>
<P>It was a bold and arrogant Speech which <HI>Nestorius</HI> made in
his Sermon before <HI>Theodotius</HI> the younger; <HI>Da mihi, O Empe|rator,
terram ab Haereticis repugnatum &amp; ego tibi vicissim ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">lum
dabo; disperde mecum Haereticos, &amp; ego tecum disperdam Pers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s;</HI>
which is in English, O Emperor, give to me the Land purg|ed
from Hereticks; and I, instead thereof, will give thee Hea|ven:
destroy me the Hereticks, and I will destroy with thee
the <HI>Persians:</HI> It was as groundless, as unwarrantable, as it
was bloody and inhumane. And we see the contrary events
prove truer; for <HI>Theodosius</HI> and <HI>Valentinian</HI> were prosperous
Princes, and have the reputation of great piety; but they
were so far from doing what <HI>Nestorius</HI> had suggested, that they
restrained him from his violence and immanity; and <HI>Theo|dosius</HI>
did highly commend B. <HI>Proclus,</HI> for his sweetness of
deportment towards erring persons, far above the cruelty of
his Predecessor <HI>Atticus.</HI></P>
<P>And the experience which <HI>Christendom</HI> hath had in this last age,
is Argument enough&punc; That Tolleration of differing Opinions
is so far from disturbing the publick peace, or destroying the
Interest of Princes, and Common-wealths, that it doth ad|vant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ge
the Publick, it secures the Peace, because there is not
<PB N="12" REF="7">
so much as the Pretence of Religion left to such persons to
contend for, it being already indulged to them.</P>
<P>When <HI>France</HI> fought against the <HI>Hugonots,</HI> the spilling of
their own Blood was Argument enough of the imprudence of
that way of promoting Religion; but since she hath given
permission to them, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The great instance is in the differing Temper, Govern|ment,
and Success which <HI>Margaret</HI> of <HI>Parma,</HI> and the Duke
of <HI>Alva</HI> had; the clemency of the first had almost distinguished
the Flame; but when she was removed, D. <HI>Alva</HI> succeeded, and
mannaged the matter of Religion with Fire and Sword, he
made the Flame so great, that his Religion, and his Prince
too, had both been almost turned out of the Countrey; <HI>Pelli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e
medio sapientiam quoties vi res agitur,</HI> said Ennius, <HI>[Wisdom is dri|ven
out, when the matter is acted by force.]</HI></P>
<P>[And therefore the best of men, and most glorious of Prin|ces,
were alwayes ready to give <HI>Tolleration.</HI>]</P>
<P>Esebeus <HI>in his second Book of the life of</HI> Constantine, <HI>reports
these words of the Emperor,</HI> <Q>Parem cum fidelibus ij qui errant
pacis, &amp; quiet is fruitionem gaudentes accipiant: ipsa si quidem com|municationis
&amp; societatis restitutio ad rectam etiam veritatis viam
perducere potest; nemo cuiquam molestis sit, quisque quod animo de|stinat
hoc etiam faciat;</Q> Let them which err with joy receive the like
fruition of Peace and quietness with the faithfull, sith the restoring
of communication and society may bring them into the right Way of
Truth: Let none give molestation to any; let every one do as he de|termines
in his mind.</P>
<P>And indeed there is great reason for Princes to give Tol|leration
to disagreeing persons, whose Opinions cannot by
fair means be altered; for if the persons be confident, they
will serve God according to their perswasions; and if they be
publickly prohibited, they will privately convene, and then
all those inconveniences, and mischiefs, which are Argu|ments
against the permission of Conventicles, are Arguments
for the publick permissions of differing Religions, &amp;c.&mdash;they
being restrained, and made miserable, indears the dis|contented
<PB N="13" REF="7">
persons mutuall, and makes more hearty and
dangerous confederations.</P>
<P><HI>King</HI> Iames <HI>in his Letters to the States of the</HI> Vnited-Pro|vinces,
<HI>dated</HI> Mar. 6. 1613. <HI>thus wrot&mdash;</HI><Q>Ita ut prohibeatis Mi|nistros
vestros ne eas disputationes in suggestum aut ad plebem feran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s,
ac districte imperetis ut pacem colant se in vicem tolerando in ista opini|onum
ac sententiarum discrepantia</Q>&mdash;So that you may sorbid your
Ministers, that they bring not those Disputations into the Pulpit, or
to the People, and strickly command, that they embrace peace among
themselves, by Tollerating in that difference of Opinions, and Iudg|ments.</P>
<P>The Counsel like in the divisions of <HI>Germany,</HI> at the first Re|formation,
was thought reasonable by the Emperor <HI>Ferdi|nand,</HI>
and his excellent Son <HI>Maximilian;</HI> for they had ob|served,
That Violence did exasperate, was unblest, unsucces|full,
and unreasonable; and therefore they made Decrees of
Tolleration.</P>
<P>And the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> repenting of his War, undertaken
for Religion against the <HI>Peidmontans,</HI> promised them Tolera|tion;
and was as good as his word&mdash;As much is done by
the nobility of <HI>Polonia:</HI> so that the best Princes and the best
Bishops gave Toleration and Impunities (but it is known,
that the first Persecution of disagreeing Persons was by the
<HI>Arrians,</HI> by <HI>Circumcellians,</HI> and <HI>Donatists,</HI> and from them they
of the Church took Example, &amp;c.) And among the <HI>Greeks</HI>
it became a publick and authorized practise, till the question of
Images grew hot and high; for then the Worshippers of Ima|ges,
having taken their example from the Empress <HI>Irene,</HI> who put
her sons eyes out for making an Edict against Images, began
to be as cruel, as they were deceived, especially, being encou|raged
by the Pope of <HI>Rome,</HI> who then blew the Coales to some
purpose.</P>
<P>I may upon this occasion give account of this affair in the
Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> It is remarkable that till the time of <HI>Iusti|nian</HI>
the Emperor, <HI>A. D.</HI> 525. the <HI>Catholicks</HI> and <HI>Novatians</HI>
had Churches indifferently permitted even in <HI>Rome</HI> it self, but
the Bishops of <HI>Rome,</HI> whose interest was much concerned in it,
<PB N="14" REF="8">
spoke much against it, and laboured the eradication of the <HI>No|vatians;</HI>
and at last when they got power into their hands
they served them accordingly; but it is observed by <HI>So|crates</HI>
that when the first persecution was made against them
at <HI>Rome</HI> by Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> the first, at the same instant the
<HI>Goths</HI> invaded <HI>Itally,</HI> and became Lords of all, it being just
in God, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And I have heard it observed as a blessing upon S. <HI>Austin</HI> (who
was so merciful to erring Persons) as the greatest part of his
life&mdash;to tolerate them, and never to indure that they should
be given over to the secular power to be killed) that the very
night the <HI>Vandals</HI> set down before his City of <HI>Hippo,</HI> to besiege it,
he died, and went to God; being taken from the miseries to
come.</P>
<P>But in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> the Popes were the first Preach|ers
of <HI>Force</HI> and <HI>Violence</HI> in matters of Opinion, and that so
zealously that Pope <HI>Vigilius</HI> suffered himself to be imprisoned,
and handled roughly by the Emperor <HI>Iustinian,</HI> rather then he
would consent to the restitution and peace of certain disa|greeing
persons, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The first that preached that Doctrine was <HI>Dominick,</HI> the

in memory of which the Inquisition is intrusted only
to the <HI>Fryars</HI> of his order; and if there be any force in

be signified by his mothers Dream, who the night before <HI>Do|minick</HI>

his Disciples expound the Dream, it was a better sign that
he should prove a <HI>Rabid,</HI> furious incendiary then any thing
else, what ever he might be in the other parts of his life;
in this Doctrine he was not much better, as appears in his de|portment
towards the <HI>Abligences,</HI> against whom he so preached
<HI>&mdash;Adeo quidem ut centum hereticorum millia ab octo millibus ca|tholicorum

<PB N="15" REF="8">
this was the the first Example of putting erring Per|sons

<P>By this time I hope it will not be thought unreasonable to say,
He that teaches mercy to erring Persons teaches indifferency
in Religion, unless so many Fathers, and so many Churches,

abused by Tyranny, Popery and faction) did teach indiffe|rency:

<P>I have shewn that Christianity doth not puni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">h corporally

<P>The <HI>Donatists,</HI> and <HI>Circumcelians,</HI> and <HI>Arrians,</HI> and <HI>Itaciani,</HI>
they of old did in the middle Ages; the Patrons of Images did,
and the Papists at this day do, and have done ever since they
were taught it by their St <HI>Dominick.</HI></P>
<P>Let all Errors be as much, and as zealously supprest as may
be, but let it be done by such means as are proper instruments of
their suppression, by Preaching and Disputation, by Charity
and Sweetness, by Holiness of Life, Assiduity of Exhortation,
by the Word of God, and Prayer.</P>
<P>For these wayes are most natural, most prudent, most peace|able
and effectual, only let not men be hasty, in calling every
disliked Opinion by the name of Heresie; and when they
have resolved that they will call it so, let them use the erring
person like a Brother, not beat him like a Dog, or convince
him with a Gibbit, or vex him out of his understanding or
perswasion.</P></Q>
<Q><P>Thus far <HI>Ier. Taylor;</HI> these Passages being truly collected out of
his Epistle, where are many more to the same purpose; to
which the Reader is referred for further satisfaction, if he de|sire
it: And further in his Sixteenth Section, for the lawfulness
of Princes giving Tolleration to several Religions, he hath
these Passages.</P>
<P>For it may be safe in diversity of perswasions; and it is al|so
a part of Christian Religion, that the Liberty of mens
Consciences should be preserved in all things, where God hath
not set a limit&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="9">
That the Soul of man should be free, and acknowledge no
Master but Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>That matters Spiritual should not be restrained by punish|ments
corporal.</P>
<P>That the same meekness and Charity should be preserved in
the promotion of Christianity, that gave it foundation, and
increment, and firmness in its first publication.</P>
<P>And that Persons should not more certainly be condemned
then their Opinions confuted.</P>
<P>And lastly, That the Infirmities of men, and difficulties of
things, should be both put in ballance, to make abatement in the
diffinitive sentence against mens persons.</P>
<P>As Christian Princes must look to the interest of their Go|vernment;
so especially must they consider the interests of
Christianity, and not call every redargution, or modesty, dis|covery
of an established Error, by the name of the disturbance
of the Peace; For,</P>
<P>It is very likely that the peevishness, and impatience of con|tradiction
in the Governors may break the peace.</P>
<P>Let them but remember the Gentleness of Christianity;
the Liberty of Consciences which ought to be preserved; and
let them do justice to the persons, whoever they are that are
peevish; provided no mans person be over-born with preju|dice:
For</P>
<P>If it be necessary for all men to subscribe to the present esta|blished
Religion; by the same reason, at another time, a man
may be bound to subscribe to the contradictory, and so to all
Religions in the World. Uncharitableness is much prevented
when no person is on either side engaged upon revenge, or
troubled with disgrace, or vexed with punishments, by any de|cretory

<HEAD>REASONS
FOR
Liberty of Conscience.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Several Reasons rendred, why no outward
Force, nor Imposition, ought to be used in
Matters of Faith and Religion, by R. H. S. F.
and F. H.</HEAD>
<P>LIBERTY of CONSCIENCE ought to be al|lowed
in the dayes of the Gospel, in the free Exer|cise
of it to God-ward (without Compulsion) in all
things relating to His Worship, for these <HI>REASONS</HI>
following.</P>
<P>1. Because the General and Universal Royal-Law of Christ
commands it, <HI>Matth. 7. 12. All things whatsoever ye would that
men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the Law and
Prophets&mdash;</HI>That which every man would have,
and receive from another, he ought by Christs <HI>RVLE</HI> to
give and allow it to another. But every man is willing to have
the <HI>LIBERTY</HI> of his <HI>OWN CONSCIENCE,</HI> there|fore
ought to <HI>ALLOW</HI> it to another.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="12">
2. Because no man can perswade the Conscience of another,
either what God is, or how he should be worshipped, but by
the Spirit, which God hath given to instruct man in the Ways
of Truth.</P>
<P>3. Because, all Obedience or Service that is obtained by
force, is for fear of Wrath, and not from Love, nor for Con|science
sake; and therefore will but continue so long as that
fear or force abides upon them.</P>
<P>4. Because, that by forcing, no man can make a Hypocrite
to be a true Believer; but on the contrary, many may be made
Hypocrites.</P>
<P>5. Because, that in all forced Impositions upon mens Con|sciences,
there is something of the wrath of man exercised, which
works not the Righteousness of God, but rather begets enmity
in the heart one towards another.</P>
<P>6. Because, that by forcing any thing upon mens Consci|ences,
as to matters of Faith and Worship, many are hardened
in their hearts against the things imposed; when as otherwise,
through Love and gentle Instructions their hearts might be
perswaded to willing obedience.</P>
<P>7. Because, that Persecution for Conscience contradicteth
Christs Charge, <HI>Matth.</HI> 13. who bids that the Tares (or false
Worshippers) be suffered to grow together in the Field (or
World) till the Harvest (or End of the World.)</P>
<P>8. Because, Force is contrary to the end for which it is
pretended to be used <HI>(viz.)</HI> The preservation and safety of
the Wheat, which End is not answered by Persecution, be|cause
the Wheat is in danger to be plucked up thereby, as
Christ saith.</P>
<P>9. Because to Force is inconsistant with the belief of the
Jews Conversion (and other false Worshippers) which is pray|ed
for by the publick Teachers, and cannot be attained, if Per|secution
for Conscience be prosecuted.</P>
<P>10. Because they that impose upon mens Consciences, exer|cise
Dominion over mens Faith, which the Apostles denied, say|ing,
<HI>They had not Dominion over any mans Faith.</HI></P>
<P>11. Because, Imposition upon mens Consciences necessitates
<PB N="24" REF="13">
them to sin, in yielding a Conformity contrary to their own
Faith; for whatsoever is not of a mans own Faith, is sin.</P>
<P>12. Because, that Imposition and Force wrestles with flesh
and blood, and carnal Weapons, which are contrary to the A|postles
Doctrine, who said, <HI>Our Weapons are not Carnal, but Spi|ritual,
and Mighty through God; and we wrestle not with Flesh, and
Blood.</HI></P>
<P>13. Because, there is but <HI>One Iudge, Law-giver,</HI> and <HI>King</HI> in
and over the Conscience, as the Saints have testified in the
Scriptures of Truth; and whosoever would intrude, so as to
be Judge and Law-giver over the Conscience, intrencheth up|on
the Perogative of Christ, <HI>Isa. 33. 22. Iames</HI> 4. 12.</P>
<P>14. <HI>Because, it is prophesied in</HI> Isa. 11, The Woolf shall dwell
with the Lamb, and the Leopard shall lie down with the Kid, and there
shall be no Destroyer in all the Holy Mountain: <HI>And therefore no
Imposition upon mens Consciences.</HI></P>
<P>15. <HI>Because, to impose upon mens Consciences for differences
in Faith, is contrary to the Advice of the Apostle, who directs
People</HI> to wait upon God to be satisfied, <HI>and not to the Magistrates,
or others, to be forced; who saith,</HI> Whereunto we have attained,
let us walk; and wherein any man is otherwise minded, God shall re|veal,
even that unto him.</P>
<P>16. Because, to force mens Consciences, and to lay Yoaks
upon them, is to make void the Blood-shed and Sufferings
of Christ, who sits upon the Throne of the Conscience, and
gives liberty there; and commands us to stand fast in that liber|ty,
and not to be entangled through the Impositions of men, or
Yoak of bondage, <HI>Gal.</HI> 5. 6.</P>
<P>17. Because, in all Nations the different Professions and
Perswasions of Religion, are either Friends or Enemies to
the Governors; if Friends then obliged by that bond; if
Enemies then Christ's Command is to take place, who saith, <HI>Love
your Enemies,</HI> which if observed, Persecution for Conscience
will be avoided.</P>
<P>18. Because Toleration of different Perswasions in Religion
was allowed in the <HI>Iewish</HI> State, as not inconsistant with their
<PB N="25" REF="13">
Safety, and that in things contrary each to other, as the <HI>Saddu|ces,
Pharisees, Esaeans, Herodians,</HI> with others.</P>
<P>19. Because, the true <HI>Religion</HI> cannot be preached up by force
of <HI>ARMES,</HI> and the primitive <HI>Christians</HI> detested that Form
of Proceedings.</P>
<P>20. Because, no man hath such power (by outward com|pulsion)
over the Souls and Consciences of other men, as to
lay a necessity on them to believe that which they do not believe,
or not to believe what they do believe; true Faith being the
Gift of God.</P>
<P>21. Because, If the Magistrate imposeth upon the Con|science,
he must either do it as a Magistrate, or as a Chri|stian.
Not as a Magistrate, for then <HI>Heathens</HI> (being Ma|gistrates)
have the same power to impose; and so, by Revo|lutions,
and Conquests, may come to give Laws to Christians,
and compel them to Idolatry. 2. Not as <HI>Christians,</HI> for that
contradicts Christ's saying, <HI>The Kings of the</HI> Gentiles <HI>exercise
Lordship over them, but it shall not be so among you, for all ye are
Brethren.</HI></P>
<P>22. Because&punc; by the same <HI>Rule</HI> and <HI>Reason</HI> that the Magi|strates
of one Nation ought to impose upon, and persecute for
Conscience, the Magistrates in all other Nations ought to do
the same, and so the greatest part of Mankind may come to be
destroyed, there being more that Dissent, than are at Unity in
Matters of <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Religion.</HI></P>
<P>23. Because the strength of <HI>Truth,</HI> and its Conquest over
<HI>Falsity</HI> and <HI>Deceit</HI> is best discovered by letting both have their
<HI>Liberty,</HI> from outward Compulsion; For no doubt, had out|ward
<HI>Force</HI> been less used, the prevalency of Truth had been
more manifest, and that wise Saying, truly experienced in the
World, <HI>viz. That which is of God will stand, and that which is not,
will come to nothing.</HI></P>
<P>24. Because, the Disciples of Christ are rebuked by him for
desiring the Destruction of those that were contrary to him,
and would not receive Him; which zeal is sharply reproved in
his Saying, <HI>They knew not what Spirit they were of.</HI></P>
<P>25. Because, to impose upon mens Consciences, and to de|stroy
<PB N="26" REF="14">
their Persons for difference in <HI>Religion,</HI> is contrary to the
end of Christ's coming, who saith, <HI>He came not to</HI> Destroy <HI>mens</HI>
Lives <HI>but to</HI> save <HI>them.</HI></P>
<P>26. Because&punc; People of divers <HI>Religions</HI> in one Nation, if not
tollerated, must some of them be destroyed or removed, by ba|nishment?
If destroyed, the Constancy and Patience of the
Sufferers for their Faith, moving <HI>Pitty</HI> and <HI>Commiseration,</HI> makes
men more ready to own, then to reject their Faith; and so rather
multiplies, than lessens the number of its <HI>Professors;</HI> if banish|ed,
this renders the Banished as so many Enemies abroad, rea|dy
upon all occasions to disturb the Peace and Tranquillity of
their own native Country. There is therefore in order to the
outward welfare of all Nations, a kind of necessity for a <HI>Tolle|ration</HI>
in them of all <HI>Religions.</HI></P>
<P>27. Because, to impose upon mens Consciences begets a hatred
against the Imposers in those who are imposed upon, and forced
thereby to violate their Consciences towards God, in matters
of Worship.</P>
<P>28. Because, men are commanded to be subject to the Pow|ers
that are, for Conscience sake, and therefore such Powers
ought not to persecute men for <HI>Conscience sake,</HI> being that is pre|scribed
for the Rule of Obedience, the Scriptures saying, <HI>Be ye
subject not only for Wrath, but for Conscience sake.</HI></P>
