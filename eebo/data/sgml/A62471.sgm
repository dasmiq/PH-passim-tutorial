<P>I Have perused this learned and pious discourse concerning the

<P>_WHen the glad tidings of the Gospels sounding in Ame|rica by the preaching of the English arrived hither, my soule also rejoyced with|in me, and I remembred certaine papers that had been laid aside a long time, upon review of them, and some additions to them, they were privately commu|nicated unto such as perswaded earnestly they might behold further light; being thus fini|shed, and licenced also to walke abroad, as

as they occurred in reading and observing, to stirre up and awa|ken more able inquisitors, to looke after the beginning, nature, civilizing, and Gospellizing those people, and to cast in my poore mite towards the encouragement of our Countreymen in such their pious undertaking; and though some men have spoken meane things of them in reference to their labours that way, as if they had been negligent therein, such men consider not I feare, how long their Countreymen have been wrastling with divers difficul|ties, and busily employing their minds and time in providing out|ward accommodations for themselves in a strange land, they re|member not the naturall perversenesse of all mankind to spirituall things, nor with what counterworkes Satan doth oppose the un|derminers of his Principalities, nor how he hath broken the language of the Natives into severall tongues and dialects to im|pede their conversion, nor how the Novangles have themselves been broken into divers ruptures, lest they should be at leasure to further the enlargement of Christs Kingdome upon the spoiles and dimination of his; this was in the purpose of their hearts at first, and now to their comfort they do abundantly see that the Na|tives are a docible people, who for their contempt of gold &amp; silver, and for some other reasons, have been deemed bruitish, and almost irrationall; but to what is after written it may be mentioned in this place, that in <HI>Mexico</HI> they were observed to be wise and politique in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Id. p. 37.</NOTE> government, to the admiration of Christians, yea they were not ig|norant in those parts of letters and writing, though in a different fashion from others: <HI>Acosta</HI> did observe, the Iewes write from the right hand to the left, others from the left to the right, the Chinois<NOTE PLACE="marg">l 6. c. 9.</NOTE> or East-Indians write from the top to the bottom, &amp; the Mexicans from the bottome to the top, the Reformed Dominican in his new<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr <HI>Gage.</HI> p. 18<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"></NOTE> survey of the West-Indies, tells of a Town as he travelled, called <HI>A|mat Titlan,</HI> a Towne of Letters, and of very curious Artifices of<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 50. &amp;c.</NOTE> their Citizens, of Goldsmiths worke and otherwise, their inge|nuity, cunning and courage is marvelously manifest in their lea|ding<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acost. l. 3. c. 15.</NOTE> a Whale as big as a mountaine, with a cord, and vanqui|shing him in this manner; by the helpe of their Canoes or little Boats, they come neare to the broad side of that huge creature, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">and with great dexterity leape upon his necke, there they ride as on horsebacke, and thrust a sharpe stake into his nosthrill, so they

And yet they have more a|bundantly testified their pious integrity in serious endeavours to propogate Gospel-holinesse, even to those that be without, their godly labours Christianizing the Natives must be remembred to their praise, they have had long and longing preparative thoughts and purposes that way, and as Saint <HI>Paul</HI> once to his Corinthians, 2. 6. 11. they have seemed to say O Americans, <HI>our mouth is opened unto you, our heart is enlarged, you are not straightned in us, be not straightned in your owne bowels, and now for a recompence of all our endeavours</HI> to preach Christ unto you, we aske no more, but be ye also enlarged with gladnesse to receive the Lord Iesus Christ: their active industry in this kind with the successe is now famously visible in severall discourses, which whosoever shall read will be sufficiently contented in his spirituall

<HEAD>An Epistolicall Discourse Of Mr. <HI>IOHN DURY,</HI> TO Mr. <HI>THOROWGOOD.</HI></HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Concerning his conjecture that the Americans are descended from the Israelites.</P>
<P>With the History of a Portugall Iew, <HI>Antonie Monterinos,</HI> attested by <HI>Manasseh Ben Israel,</HI> to the same effect.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Am bound to thank you for the communication of your booke, which I have read with a great deale of delight and satisfaction; for the rarity of the subject, and the variety of your observati|ons thereupon, which you have deduced with as much probability to make out your theme, as History can afford matter: I did shew it to another friend of great judgement and ingenuity, who was so taken with it, that he said he would have it to be coppied out at his cost, if you would not publish it to the world, which hee and I have resol|ved
<PB REF="15">
to imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">rtune you to doe: for although at first blush, the thing which you offer to be believed, will seeme to most men incredible, and extravigant; yet when all things are laid ratio|nally and without prejudice together, there will be nothing of improbability found therein, which will not be swallowed up with the appearance of contrary likelyhoods, of things possi|ble and la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ely attested by some to be truths: whereof to con|firme your probable conjectures, I shall give you that informa|tion which is come to my hands at severall times in these late yeares, which you, (if you shall thinke fit) may publish to the world, as I have received them&punc; which to the probability of your conjectures adde so much light, that if the things which I shall relate be not meere fictions (which I assure you are none of mine, for you shall have them without any addition, as I have received them) none can make any further scruple of the truth of your assertion; but before I come to particulars, I shall tell you of some thoughts which are come upon this occasion into my minde, concerning Gods way of dealing with mens spirits for the manifestation of his truth and wisdome to those that seeke after it; and concerning the wonderfull contrivances by which he brings his counsell to passe beyond all mens thoughts: I have observed&punc; and every one that will take notice must needs perceive, that the spirits of men in reference to spiritual matters, whether divine or humane (by humane, I meane all matters of science and industry depending upon judgement and saga|city) are distinguishable into two kinds, the one are stedfast to some principles, and the other are unstable; this distinction in divine matters is clear, from 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3. 17. <HI>Iude,</HI> ver. 3, 4, 6, 12, 13, 17, 18, 20, 21. and in humane matters wee need none other proofe but daily experience. Againe, these that are stedfast to their principles, will be found of two sorts; some are led in an ordinary common way and rest therein, admitting of nothing further then what they have attained unto; some (though they doe not undervalue the ordinary waies which in their owne kinds are usefull and necessary, yet they) aspire to something more then ordinary and rest not where they are, they believe that both in humane and divine matters, there is, as long as we are in this life, a <HI>plus ultra,</HI> and that we never ought
<PB REF="15">
to rest in seeking after the advancement of learning and the increase of knowledge, till wee shall come to see the Father of lights face ro face; the different inclinations of these three sorts of men in the world, leading them to different courses and straines in their proceedings, and these begetting divers encounters amongst them wherein they disagree, and know not how to right matters towards one another for mutuall con|tent and edification, are the causes of all our strife and confusi|on in all affaires, as well of Religious as of civill concernment; nor is it possible to be free from the disorders and distempers, which make the life of mankinde uncomfortable in this kind, and full of vexation, till God hath removed those that fall away from their owne stedfastnesse out of the earth, which will not come to passe till hee hath <HI>filled the earth with the knowledge of</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Esa. 11. 9.</NOTE> <HI>the Lord as the waters cover the sea;</HI> till hee hath brought us all that are stedfast unto true principles, and that walke by rules, <HI>unto the unity of the faith and knowledge of the sonne of God, un|to</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 4 13.</NOTE> <HI>a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fulnesse of Christ:</HI> which things because they are clearely promised, wee may expect shall come to passe, but till then we shall be carried<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 4. 14.</NOTE> differently about with severall winds of doctrine, and ensnared in our owne ignorance by the cunning craftinesse of men who lie in waite to deceive; for the unstable are either wickedly set to worke changes upon those that are setled for ends of their owne, or weakely carried up and downe through the un|certaine apprehensions of things differently represented unto them, sometimes one way and sometimes another; so that be|tween the motions of mens spirits subtilly unstable tending to unsettle others, and weakely stable susceptible of any unsettle|ment from others, all our changes and disorderly carriages, both in divine and humane affaires doe arise; when either those that have no principles of truth to walke by, study lies to puz|zle those that pretend to walke by rules, or those that have true principles vary from one another in their degrees of under|standing, and in their manner of applying the same to advance knowledge, and to make discoveries of Gods manifestation of himselfe; for as these motions meet with one another in opposite courses, and men led thereby, stand by one another
<PB REF="16" MS="y">
in disproportionat frames, or justle one another out of their places for contrary ends; so all our confusions and revolutions of Churches, and States, and therein of scientificall straines, and of practicall undertakings, arise differently in the world: here then is a threefold diversity in acting, the changeable and moveable disposition of the one sort, is made to try the stabili|ty of the other two, and those that are setled in an ordinary way, are tryers to those that are led forth to something that is extraordinary; and those that upon allowed principles do ratio|nally bring forth something more then ordinary, try the in|genuity of the other two, how farre they love truth for it selfe; So that each of these puts his neighbour to the triall of his pro|perty, and constraines him to manifest the nature of his way, how farre it is, or is not from God: And although every thing which is beyond the ordinary straine, is liable to be censured and contradicted by men of ordinary apprehensions. who con|demne for the most part as extravagant and ridiculous whatso|ever is not levell with their capacities; yet I am inclined to believe, that there is alwaies something of God in all men, that are led forth by extraordinary motions, namely when their spi|rits doe not reject the common true principles, and yet are rai|sed above them, to apprehend conclusions and inferences which are not common; and when their affections are regularly con|stant to their workes, and their undertakings pursued with so|briety in the feare of God, then I conceive that God hath put upon them a speciall stampe and character of his vertue, by which he doth fit them for some designe and service whereun|to he hath raised them. I have observed this in very many men of publike spirits, most commonly they have bin laught at by others for going out of the common road-way of acting; whether to make good some opinions, which others never dreamt of, or to doe some businesse which others have thought impossibilities to be effected; (I say) I have observed, that when they have been led forth with modesty, without selfe concei|tednesse and vanity, and when they have prosecuted their en|terprises with remarkable perseverance, that God hath made them one way or other remarkably instrumentall and usefull to|wards their generation for the advancement of his worke,

which is the reformation of this world, and the restauration of all things by the kingdom of Iesus Christ, whereunto all extraordi|nary gifts, and the unusuall leadings forth of mens spirits are pre|paratives. I could instance in severall men which I have known, and doe know abroad and at home, of severall professions, whose studies and endeavours have been lookt upon as whim|sies and extravagancies by the road-way-men of that profession; and yet I am perswaded that they are led and acted by that Spirit which leadeth the children of God in all truth; and because other men otherwise rationall and observant, (who though not altogether destitute of the spirit, yet are not raised above the ordinary pitch) do not know the drift of the spirit of these; therefore these are lookt upon by them as men of odde conceits: I have seen some of the great Rabbies of our times, heretofore much scandalized at the proposals and under|takings of Mr <HI>Comenius;</HI> but it hath pleased God to assist him so with grace, and support him with constancy in his way, not|withstanding many trialls and temptations; that he hath been able during his owne life, to see the usefulnesse of some of his endeavours, whereof a more full account will be given to the world very shortly. I could speake of others, whose attempts, though not so apparantly successefull during their life, yet no lesse usefull in their kind, and which in due time, will prove the grounds of great advantages and discoveries unto posterity, although in the generation where their lot is fallen to live, they have not been believed nor received. Gods way to dispence grace is not according to outward appearances, and for this cause, the multitude doth not entertaine the instruments there|of with due esteem, nor the meanes by which it is offered to the world with respect, because they come in a homely dresse, and without the affectation of any shew; neverthelesse wisdom at all times is justified by her children, and there take notice of her paths, and trace the counsell of God therein, for they can see that Gods waies and counsels reach from end to end, and that he comprehends in his aime both that which is past, and that which is present, and that which is to come in future ages; so that in the conclusion of all, he will make it appeare, that the unusuall motions of his servants, which the world have
<PB REF="17">
disesteemed and counted foolishnesse, have been the extraordi|nary worke of his Spirit in them, whereby he doth convince the world of sinne, of righteousnesse, of judgement: of sinne, because the testimony which they bore to the truth was not re|ceived; of righteousnesse, because they who served their ge|neration faithfully with the righteous use of their talent in the midst of scorners, are justly taken away from an unthankfull generation and the evill day, to rest from their labours, that their workes may follow them; and of judgement, because the selfe conceited pride and partiality of the wise and prudent of this world, shall be judged and condemned by the worke of his spirit, when he shall bring all the effects thereof together to make out his compleate designe against the world, and by the conjunction of the seemingly scattered parts which his ser|vants have acted upon their stages, produce the new frame of a perfect Scene, the catastrophe whereof shall make up a buil|ding fit for the kingdom of his Son.</P>
<P>I am fallen upon these thoughts, and acquaint you thus with them, partly to support mine owne spirit against the contra|dictions which I meet withall in the way wherein God hath set me, for the constant prosecution of peace and truth without partiality amongst my brethren; partly to apologize for the drift of your spirit, whereby I perceive you have been led these many yeares in some of your studies; for it is very evi|dent to me, that you have sought after a matter, which to most men will seem incredible, rediculous and extravagant; and to tell you the truth, before I had read your discourse and seriously weighed matters, when I thought upon your theme, that the Americans should be of the seed of Israell, it seemed to me some what strange and unlikely to have any truth in it; but af|terward when I had weighed your deduction of the matter, and lookt seriously upon Gods hand in bringing into those parts of the World where the Americans are, so many religious pro|fessors, zealous for the advancement of his glory, and who are possessed with a beliefe from the Scriptures, that all the Tribes of Israell shall be called to the knowledge of Jesus Christ, be|fore the the end of the world: and when I had recollected and laid together some other scattered and confused thoughts
<PB REF="17" MS="y">
which at several times I have received, partly from the places of Scripture, which foretell the calling of the Jewes, and their restitution to their owne land, together with the bringing back of the ten Tribes from all the ends and corners of the earth, partly from some relations which I had heard a few yeeres agoe concerning the ten Tribes, which the Jewes here in <HI>Europe</HI> had given out; and partly from the observations of Gods way, which he seemes to make by all these changes&punc; and the dissolu|tion of the States and Empires of the world, towards some great worke, and extraordinary revolution which may shortly come to passe: all which things when I had called to mind and represented unto my selfe, I was so far from derogating any thing from that which you have conjectured concerning the American Indians; that I beganne to stand amazed at the ap|pearances of the probabilities which so many waies offered themselves unto me, to make out and confirme the effect of that which you have said: And then I begun also upon ano|ther account, to wonder at the strangenesse of Gods conduct o|ver your spirit, that he should have set you a worke twelve or more yeeres agoe, after the search of such a matter, by histo|ricall observations, whereof then so few, and almost no foot|steps at all were extant to be traced, and whereof now, of a suddaine, the world is like to be filled with such evidences, that it wil be an astonishment to all that shall heare of it, and lay it to heart; and that all who have any ingenuity will be constrai|ned to confesse, that indeed there is a God who ruleth in the earth, and that he hath ordered the affaires of the Nations by an universal providence, to bring to passe his own counsels, and that the things which hee hath revealed by his word, should in the latter times be accomplished; for to my apprehension, this will be the great benefit of these discoveries; namely, that the mouths of Atheists will be stopped, and convicted of irratio|nality and foolishnesse: For when it shall appear to all men un|deniably, that the transmigration of Nations, and the affaires of this world, have not been carried hitherto by meere chance, or by the craftinesse of humane counsels, or by force; but by the wisdome of a Supreame conduct, who hath ordered all things from the beginning towards an end which hath been
<PB REF="18" MS="y">
foreknown, and to a designe foretold. (I say) when this shall appeare, and that in the midst of all these changes and confusi|ons, there is a conduct over-ruling the force of man, and dis|appointing the councels of the crafty; then the eyes of all men will be upon the Lord, and God alone will bee exalted in righ|teousnesse, and the Holy one of Israell in judgement: For see|ing it is evident that the ten Tribes of Israell have been as it were lost in the world neare about the space of two thuusand yeeres, if now they should againe appeare upon the stage, first as it were in another world by themselves, and then afterward speedily come from thence hither to the land of their ancient inheritance, where they shall be joyned to their brethren the Jews (which is clearly foretold by the Prophets shall come to passe) if (I say) those things should now begin to come to passe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 2. Ezec. 34 &amp; 37. Jer. 3c. &amp; 46. Amos. 9. Micha. 4. &amp;c.</NOTE> what can all the world say otherwise, but that the Lords coun|sell doth stand, and that he hath fulfilled the words spoken by his Servants the Prophets concerning Israel; that although all the sinfull kingdoms of the Nations shall be destroyed from off the face of the earth, yet that the house of <HI>Iacob</HI> shall not be ut|terly destroyed, but shall be corrected in measure, <HI>for loe I will command</HI> (saith God by the Prophet) <HI>and I will sift the house</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jer. 30. 10, 11. Amos&punc; 9. 8, 9.</NOTE> <HI>of Israell among all Nations, like as corne is sifted in the sieve, yet shall not the least graine fall upon the earth.</HI> These Prophe|cies must needs be fulfilled, if there be a God in heaven who hath foretold them, and when he shall make this his word good unto Israell, he will thereby make it undeniably apparent, that it was he himselfe and none other who did foretell it: and that it is also none but hee who brings the worke about beyond all humane appearances, according as he did foretell it: and by all this he will shew to all the world, that which he oft-times repeates by the Prophet <HI>Isaiah,</HI> that he alone is the Saviour, and that there is none besides him, <HI>Isa.</HI> 45. 5, 6, 15. <HI>till the end.</HI> The destruction then of the spirituall <HI>Babylon</HI> by the restauration of Israel, shall make out this to all the earth, that God alone is the Lord over all, and the Saviour of the people that put their trust in his name.</P>
<P>Now the appearances which offer themselves unto me, that these Prophecies are towards their accomplishment, are
<PB REF="18" MS="y">
many, which now I shall not insist upon, (perhaps God will direct me to declare them in due season more fully then now I can intend) but I shall onely mention that which I find to be a confirmation of your conjecture, leaving it to your owne discre|tion, what use you will make of it.</P>
<P>First then I shall impart unto you some stories which I heard five or six yeeres agoe, when I was in the Low Countries, concerning the ten Tribes; and then I shall adde some informati|on concerning the state of the Iewes in our Europaean and Asia|atique worlds, which I have learned at other times by some pro|vidences which God hath offered unto mee; and upon the whole matter I shall leave you to your further conjectures, by that which I shall guesse at.</P>
<P>The first story which I heard was at the <HI>Hague,</HI> a person of chief quality about the Queen of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and one of her Coun|sell, and a discerning godly man, and my speciall friend told me, that the Jew (a Jeweller residing ordinarily at the <HI>Hague</HI>) whom I knew, had been there at Court, and with great joy had told, that they of his Nation had received from <HI>Constanti|nople</HI> Letters, bringing to them glad tidings of two speciall matters fallen out there; the one was, that the Grand Seignior had remitted the great taxes which formerly had been laid upon the Jewes of those parts, so that now they were in a manner free from all burthens, paying but a small and inconsi|derable matter to that Empire; the other was, that a messen|ger was come unto the Jewes who reside neere about the Ho|ly Land, from the ten Tribes, to make enquiry concerning the state of the Land; and what was become of the two Tribes and the half which was left in it; when they were transported from thence by <HI>Salmanasser.</HI> This Messenger was described to be a grave man, having some attendance in good equipage a|bout him. He told them that the people from which hee was sent were the Tribes of Israel, which in the daies of <HI>Hosea</HI> the<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 King. 17.</NOTE> King, were carried captives out of their owne Land by the King of <HI>Assyria,</HI> who transported them from <HI>Samaria</HI> into <HI>Assyria</HI> and the Cities of the Medes; but they being grieved for the tronsgressions which caused God to be angry with them, they tooke a resolution to separate themselves from all Idolaters, and
<PB REF="19">
so went from the Heathen where they were placed by <HI>Salma|nassar,</HI> with a resolution to live by themselves, and observe the Commandements of God, which in the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> owne Land they had not observed: in prosecuting this resolution, after a long journey of a yeere and six moneths, they came to a countrey wholly destitute of inhabitants, where now they have increa|sed into a great Nation, and are to come from thence into their owne Land by the direction of God; and to shew them that hee was a true Israelite, hee had brought with him a Scroule of the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> written according to their cu|stome.</P>
<P>The Gentleman who told me this story, as from the mouth of the Jew, said that it brought to his mind fully (by reason of the agreement of circumstances almost in all things) the story which is recorded in the Second Booke of <HI>Esdras,</HI> which is cal|led Apocrypha, Chap. 13. ver. 40. till 50. which will be found a truth if that Messenger came and made this Narrative. This was the first story; and not long after <HI>viz.</HI> Within the space of five or six moneths, a little before I came from the Low Countries, I was told of a Jew who came from <HI>Ame|rica</HI> to <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> and brought to the Jewes residing there, newes concerning the ten Tribes; that hee had been with them upon the border of their Land, and had conversed with some of them for a short space, and seen and heard remarkable things whiles he stayed with them, whereof then I could not learn the true particulars; but I heard that a Narrative was made in writing of that which he had related, which before I went from <HI>Holland</HI> last, I had no time to seeke after, but since the reading of your Booke, and some discourse I have had with you about these matters, I have procured it from the Low Countries, and received a Copie thereof in French, attested un|der <HI>Manasseh Ben Israel</HI> his hand, that it doth exactly a|gree with the originall, as it was sent me, the translation thereof I have truly made without adding or taking a|way any thing; and because I was not satisfied in some things, and desired to know how farre the whole matter was believed among the Jewes at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> I wrote to <HI>Manasseh Ben Israel,</HI> their chiefe Rabbi, about it, and his answer I have gotten
<PB REF="19">
in two Letters, telling me that by the occasion of the Questions which I proposed unto him concerning this adjoyned Narrative<NOTE PLACE="marg">This narrative so attested and translated, is at the end of this Book.</NOTE> of Mr. <HI>Antonie Monterinos,</HI> hee to give me satisfaction, had written insteed of a Letter, a Treatise, which hee shortly would publish, and whereof I should receive so many Copies as I should desire: In his first Letter dated <HI>Novem.</HI> last, 25. he saies that in his treatise he handles of the first inhabitants of <HI>Ameri|ca,</HI> which he believes were of the ten Tribes; moreover, that they are scattered also in other Countries, which he names, and that they keepe their true Religion, as hoping to returne againe into the Holy land in due time.</P>
<P>In his second Letter, dated the twenty three of <HI>December,</HI> he saies more distinctly thus: I declare how that our Israelites were the first finders out of <HI>America;</HI> not regarding the opinions of other men, which I thought good to refute in few words onely: and I thinke that the ten Tribes live not onely there, but also in other lands scattered every where; these never did come backe to the second Temple, and they keep till this day still the Jewish Religion, seeing all the Prophecies which speake of their bringing backe unto their native Soile must be fulfilled: So then at their appointed time, all the Tribes shall meet from all the parts of the world into two provinces, namely <HI>Assyria</HI> and <HI>Egypt,</HI> nor shall their Kingdome be any more divided, but they shall have one Prince the Messiah the Sonne of <HI>David.</HI> I do also set forth the Inquisition of <HI>Spaine,</HI> and rehearse divers of our Nation, and also of Christians, Martyrs, who in our times have suffered severall sorts of torments, and then having shew|ed with what great honours our Jewes have been graced also by severall Princes who professe Christianity. I prove at large, that the day of the promised Messiah unto us doth draw neer, upon which occasion I explaine many Prophecies, &amp;c.</P>
<P>By all which you see his full agreement with your conjecture concerning the Americans, that they are descended of the Hebrewes: when his booke comes to my hand, you shall have it God willing.</P>
<P>In the meane time I shall adde some of my conjectures con|cerning the Jewes which live on this side of the world with us in <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Asia;</HI> these are of two sorts or Sects, the one is
<PB REF="20" MS="y">
of Pharisees, the other of Caraits, the Pharisees in <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Asia</HI> are in number farre beyond the Caraits, they differ from one another wheresoever they are, as Protestants doe from Papists; for the Pharisees, as the Papists, attribute more to the Authoritie and traditions of their Rabbies and Fathers, then to the word of God; but the Caraits will receive nothing for a rule of faith and obedience but what is delivered from the word of God immediately: and their name imports their professi|on, that they are readers of the Text, or Textuaries, for so the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> you know when it relates to bookes and writings, is to be rendred. These two Sects are irreconcilably opposite to each other, and as the Papists deale with Protestants, so do the Pharisees with the Caraits, they persecute and suppres them and their profession by all the meanes they can possibly make use of: Nay as Mr <HI>Ritangle</HI> (of whom I have all the informati|ons which I know concerning the Caraits) tels me, the hatred of the Pharisees is so fierce against their opposites the Caraits, that they have Anathematized them so; as never to be reconci|led unto them; insomuch, that it is counted unlawfull so much as to speake to any of them, or to any that belongeth unto them, but at the distance of foure cubits at least; their Bookes and all things belonging to them, are avoided as things abomi|nable and to be abhorred; nor will the Pharisees, although the Caraits should become penitent, and desire to be joyned to their Congregations, and renounce their owne way, admit of them as a Caraite reconciled unto them: but the Caraite must first become a Christian, a Mahumetan, or an Idolater, before he can be admitted to joyne with them, that it may never bee said that a Pharisee was reconciled to a Caraite, or that a Ca|raite is become a Pharisee. As their principles and affections are thus different, so are their opinions, and the course of their life extremely opposite; the Pharisees are full of superstitious imaginary foolish conceits, and thalmudicall questions and ni|cities in their Sermons and Bookes; the Caraits are rationall men that take up no doctrines but what the Scriptures teach, by comparing one text with another: The Pharisees have wild and extravagant fancies concerning the Messiah and his reigne; but the Caraits have true grounds of spirituall and raised thoughts
<PB REF="20">
concerning the Messiah and his Kingdome, little different from that which the better sort of Christians truly believe, and professe of these misteries. The Pharisees in their Sermons insist upon nothing but their traditions and ceremonies, and foo|lish curiosities; but the Caraits insist onely upon necessary and profitable duties, teaching the way of Godlinesse and honesty, to bring men from the outward forme to the inward power and spirituall performance of divine worship.</P>
<P>As concerning their course of life, the Pharisees live every where by a way of trading &amp; usury, which is destructive to those with whom they have commerce; but the Caraits abhor that way, as pestilent unto humane societies, and betake themselves to trades, and manufactures, to become husbandmen, and ser|vants in the places where they live, and to serve as Souldiers un|der the Magistrate, who doth protect them.</P>
<P>This being the state and difference of these two Sects, (as he who in <HI>Asia</HI> and some part of <HI>Europe</HI> hath been above twenty yeers conversant with them, and a Doctor in their Sy|nagogues, hath informed me) I shall acquaint you with my Conjectures concerning the event of our present troubles in the world over all, and the revolution of the Jewish state, which are these; that it is not unlikely to me that the issue and effect of these changes which now are wrought, and afoot to bee wrought in the world, (wherein the highest powers are sha|ken, and a generall distresse is brought upon all the Nations of the earth) will be a breaking of the yokes of tyranny and op|pression, under which not onely the Jewes every where groan, but with them most of the Gentiles, or rather all of them that are under an arbitrary power of absolute Potentates, and super|stitious selfe-seeking teachers; that the breaking of these yokes is already a great way advanced. First, in the Easterne <HI>China</HI> Empire by the invasion of the Tartarians. Secondly, in the Northerne and Easterne Mahometane Empire, by the changes brought upon, and likely to fall out in the <HI>Ottoman</HI> house and line; and by the liberty which of late hath been granted to the Jewes, not onely from taxes, but of repairing to <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and having Synagogues there, which heretofore was utterly prohibited. Thirdly, in the Westerne, which is called the Ro|man
<PB REF="21">
or German Empire, by these late troubles, and the assi|stance which the King of the <HI>North</HI> the Swede, hath given to Protestants to maintaine their liberty: All the power of these yokes must yet further be broken in the Supreame and Subordi|nate Ministers thereof&punc; in respect of the whole bodies of these Empires, and of the particular Kingdomes and States which resort under the same; for all Nations by the light of naturall reason, but chiefely those, whom the Gospel hath enlightned, and prepared in a measure, to apprehend the hope of the glo|rious liberty of the Sonnes of God, will more and more every where resent their priviledge and right to a freedome, from which they have been restrained, by the mistery of iniquity in spirituall and corporall matters; and when the grounds of righ|teous order, of impartiall love to mankinde, and of common preservation, shall breake forth at last, and be taken notice of in the midst of these confusions and great troubles which fall up|on all sorts of men; then the Jewes will come and appeare in their owne ranke, and for their own interest, they will by o|thers be respected; for their interest will be upon the dissolu|tion of the Mahometan, to resist and oppose the Spanish Monarchy, that it may not propagate it selfe Eastward, and Southward, beyond the Mediterranean Sea; and that the In|quisition by which they have been so cruelly persecuted, may be every where abolished; but above all things, kept out of the holy Land and their beloved City <HI>Ierusalem:</HI> If then there should be any transactions (as it is said there is like to be) between the <HI>Ottoman</HI> house and the house of <HI>Spaine</HI> about the Holy Land, the Jewes who are now at some liberty there, and begin from all parts of the Earth to lift up their eyes to looke thitherward, will quickely resent it, and finde their interest to be the enjoy|ment of their owne inheritance; and to helpe them to it, they will finde assistance from all Christians that are not slaves to su|perstition and tyranny, and that assistance and favour which by such Christians will be given them, may in Gods hand be a meanes to open the Pharisee his eyes, to see somewhat in Chri|stianity, from which he hath been hitherto blinded, by reason of the prejudice which the Idolatry of the Papall Sea, and the Spa|nish Inquisition hath begotten in him. As for the Caraits, God
<PB REF="21">
hath so ordered it, that the greatest bodies of them are in the Northerne parts of the World, by which the ten Tribes, if ever they come to the Holy Land, are like to come; there be some few in <HI>Russia,</HI> some in <HI>Constantinople,</HI> some in <HI>Alcair,</HI> some in <HI>Persia,</HI> and some in other places of <HI>Asia</HI> and of <HI>Africa;</HI> but Mr <HI>Ritangle</HI> told me that their chiefe bodie is amongst the Asi|atique and European Tartarians, who now appeare upon the stage as beginning to be conquerers. For besides that which they doe fully possesse in <HI>China,</HI> they have tasted somewhat of a victorious progresse of late in <HI>Poland,</HI> and they are the next pretenders to the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Crowne, if the line faile, which is like to be: their rising and dissipation abroad from their owne centers to their circumferences towards neighbour Nations, will weaken them at home; and if then, when they are not strong within their owne bounds, and by their invasions have weake|ned their neighbours Southward on; God call the ten Tribes to march toward the place of their inheritance: the Caraits their brethren will be leaders of them on their way, and so their march may be, as <HI>Manasseh Ben Israel</HI> saith, to make their Rendezvous in <HI>Assyria;</HI> and on the other side, the Jewes that are Pharisees, may make their Rendezvous from <HI>Arabia</HI> and other neighbouring places, and out of all <HI>Europe</HI> into <HI>Egypt;</HI> that so when the Shunamite shall returne (as it is said in the <HI>Canticles,</HI> chap. 6. ver. 13.) the world may looke upon her, and may see in her <HI>the company of two Armies,</HI> which both shall look towards <HI>Ierusalem.</HI> Then will the great battaile of Harma|geddon be fought, whereunto all these troubles and changes are but preparatives: then shall the sword of the Spirit, the word of God, prevaile mightily over the spirits of all men; the two edges thereof on the right hand and on the left, will cut sharpe, and pierce to the dividing asunder of soule and spirit, and of the joynts and marrow, and to the discerning of the thoughts and intentions of the heart: and when this sword shall be thus powerfull in the hands of his Saints, (the true Pro|testants with the one troope, and the true Caraits with the o|ther) then shall be fulfilled the Prophecie of the Psalmist, that<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psa. 149 7, 8, 9.</NOTE> vengeance shall be executed upon the Heathen, and punish|ments upon the people; that their Kings shall be bound with
<PB REF="22">
chaines, and their Nobles with fetters of iron; and that the honour due to all Saints shall be given them, to be made execu|tioners of the judgement written in the word of God against them. We know not how neare these things are at hand, let us therefore be watchfull, and put on the armour of light, to be ready, when the Bridegroome comes, to goe with him in our wedding garment, having our lamps burning, and provision of oile, into the wedding chamber. And to this effect, the Lord teach us to be diligent, to be found of him in peace, without spot and blamelesse, that in the midst of these fightings and con|fusions, we may not be found as many are, smiting their fellow servants, eating and drinking largely of the spoile of those that are spoiled, and being drunken with the passions of malice, en|tertained for the revenge of injuries, or of covetousnesse and ambition, prosecuted for self-interests: and with this prayer I shall commend you to the grace of God, and rest,</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> The sixth Conjecture.</HEAD>
<P>THE Americans calamities are suitable to those plagues threatned unto the Jewes, <HI>Deut.</HI> 28. Such a comment upon that terrible Scripture is not any where to be found, as among the Indians, by this also it will appear probable that they be Jews: and here three things shall be touched upon. 1. The Jewes were a very sinfull people. 2. The Indians were and are tran|scendent sufferers. 3. In that way <GAP DESC="foreign"> litterally, as was threatned to the Jewes.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Jewes were grand offenders; <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">De Arcan Ca|thol. Vent. c. 24. p. 282.</NOTE> <HI>Galatinus</HI> mentions fon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e of their enormous transgressions, with their ensuing vengeances. 1. The selling of <HI>Ioseph</HI> in|to <HI>Egypt,</HI> where themselves were kept afterwa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">d in an iron furnace, and dwelt a long time in an house of bon|dage. 2. Their first rejection of the Messiah, typified in <HI>David,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 20. 1. which was punished by the Assyrians. 3. The sacrificing of their owne children to Idols, and murthering the Prophets that deterred them from such abominations, he calls their third great offence, for which the Babylonian captivity fell upon them. 4. Their fatall and most grievous crime was
<PB N="27" REF="35">
the denyall of the <HI>Holy one, and the just, with desire that a murtherer should be given them,</HI> Act. 3. 14. and this brought upon them, first the tyranny of the Roman conquest, and then all those hideous and horrid tribu|lations that presse and oppresse them to this day.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Natives of <HI>America</HI> have endured the extre|mities of most unspeakable miseries: They are a Na|tion saith <HI>Lerius</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Lerius p. 230.</NOTE> cursed and forsaken of God, and the men of <HI>Spaine</HI> to their other cruelties added that most abominable reproach, these Barbarians are <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Benzo p. 77. 111. 167.</NOTE> dogs, unworthy of Christendome; tis too true they were so used by them, as if they had bin such or worse, they did so weare them up with labour, that they became weary of their lives, the poore creatures chusing rather to die any kind of death, than to live under such bloody Ma|sters and Monsters; they scared the Indians into woods, where the men and women hanged themselves together, and wanting instruments sometimes for such selfe exe|cution, they helped one another to knit their long locks about the branches of trees, and so cast themselves downe headlong, their owne haires being their halters; and thus many thousands of them ended their daies with most lamentable yellings and out-cries; their intestine violences and injuries among themselves were woefull by rapine, warre, and sacrificings of one another, ma|ny <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Surius in Ap|pend. ad Nau|cler. p. 775.</NOTE> thousands of them have been immolated in one day at <HI>Mexico;</HI> but their sufferings by the spaniards ex|ceed not onely all relation, but beliefe, and surely the savages could not have outstripped the Spaniards in bar|barous savagenesses, if those Infidells had gotten the upper hand of these Christians; a very prudent Cacique saith <HI>Benzo</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">P. 222.</NOTE>, that was neere an hundred yeeres old, reported freely, that when he was young, a very
<PB N="28" REF="36">
strange disease invaded those countrys, the sick common|ly vomited many filthy wormes, such a wasting plague he said followed this calamity, that we feared none of us could survive it: and a little before your comming we of <HI>Iucatana</HI> had two cruell battailes with the Mexicans, in which above one hundred and fifty thousand were slaine, but these were all light and easie vexations, in respect of those terrible examples of intollerable in|solence, avarice, and cruelty, exercised by your selves upon us; thus he: we read, when the Prophet of God soretold <HI>Hazael,</HI> the evill hee should bring upon Israel <HI>Hazael</HI> said, <HI>Is thy servant a dog that he should doe this?</HI> 2 King. 8. 13. But the Spaniards did more evill things to the Indians, and shewed themselves with shame to be worse than dogs, witnesse that bloody <HI>Bezerill,</HI> though not so bloody as his Master <HI>Didacus Salasar</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Ovied Hist. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">nd. l. 16. c. 11. <HI>in</HI> Benzo.

<P N="3">3. The Indian sufferings have runne so parallel with those threats, <HI>Deut.</HI> 28. as if they had been princi|pally intended therein also. Was Israel offending to be calamitous, <HI>in all places, towne and field, at home and</HI>

<HI>abroad, &amp;c.</HI> The poore Indians <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Casa, Benzo, alij Historici passim.</NOTE> for their gold and labour, were by the Spaniards hunted out of all places, corners and Islands, as if the end of their discovery had been indeed to make a full end, and a totall devastation of the American Nations. Against the sinning Jewes it was said, <HI>Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body, &amp;c. vers.</HI> 18. <HI>The pestilence shall cleave unto thee, &amp;c. The Lord shall smite thee with a consumption, &amp;c.</HI> ver. 21, 22, 35, 29. Strange diseases have destroyed the Natives, as the histories of those countries doe relate; their cruell task|masters the Spaniards, did so much overburthen them with load and labour, that the <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Iidem,</NOTE> cohabitation of man and wife did cease: seven thousand infants of <HI>Cuba</HI> did perish in three moneths space, their mothers worne out with toyling had no milk to give them. The Lord said, <HI>He would smite Israel with blindnesse, madnesse, and astonishment of heart, and thou shalt grope at noone day, as the blind gropeth in darknesse, &amp;c.</HI> ver. 28, 29. And woefull indeed is the veile of ignorance that is come o|ver the Natives <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg"><HI>Pet.

And these Americans were made by the Spa|niards every where and every way miserable, without any helpe or reliefe: <HI>Barthol&punc; las Casas</HI> upon fourty two yeeres sight of their suffering, sympathized so much with them, that he represented the same to King <HI>Philip,</HI> in hope to obtaine for them some favour and mercy, but he little prevailed.

and fifty, of two millions were left alive. In a|nother place hee professeth their tyranny was so cruell and detestable, that in fourty six yeeres space they cau|sed, he verily believed, more than fifty millions of them to pay their last debt to nature; for I speak, saith hee, the truth, and what I saw: they dealt with the poore Indians, not as with beasts, <HI>hoc enim peroptarem,</HI> but as if they had bin the most abject dung of the earth: and<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Id. ib.</HI> P. 7. &amp; 8</NOTE> is this the way saith <HI>Benzo</HI> to convert Infidels?

For very much is said of their suffering in riches and honour &amp;c. And the Spanish Christians that brake into <HI>Ame|rica</HI> shewed themselves so covetous of their treasure, that the Natives with wonder said <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg"><HI>Casa.</HI> P. 12. 22, 29. 54.</NOTE> surely gold is the Spaniards God; they broiled noble Indians on gridirons, to extort from them their hidden wealth, gi|ving no respect at all to their Caciques or Kings.

<P>It were endlesse to mention all the parallels that the Spaniards have drawne upon the poore Indians, accor|ding to the threats of God upon the sinning Jewes, Deut. 28. 43, <HI>The stranger that is within the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> shall get up above thee very high, and thox shalt come downe very low.</HI> 48.

<P>Their Kings and Caciques were no more regarded by them than the meanest, they enthralled all the Natives in most woefull servitude and captivity; their suffe|rings have bin most wonderfull, such as the Book of the Law hath not registred, nor any other record; they spared no age nor sex, not women with childe; they laid wagers who could digge deepest into the bodies of<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Casa.</HI> P. 19. 11.</NOTE> men at one blow, or with most dexterity cut off their heads; they tooke infants from their mothers breasts and dash'd their innocent heads against the rockes; they cast others into the rivers with scorne, making them|selves merry at the manner of their falling into the wa|ter; they set up severall gallowses, and hung upon them thirteen Indians in honour they said of Christ and his twelve Apostles: And yet further the same Bishop mervailes at the abominable blindnesse and blasphemy of his Countrymen, impropriating their bloudy crimes unto God himselfe, giving him thanks in their pros|perous tyrannies, like those thieves and Tyrants he sayth spoken of by the Prophet <HI>Zachary,</HI> 11. 5. <HI>They kill,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Id.</HI> P. 57.</NOTE> <HI>and hold themselves not guilty, and they that sell them say, Blessed be the Lord, for I am rich.</HI></P>

<PB N="37" REF="40">
never man dwelt, that they might there keepe their sta|tutes, which they never kept in their owne land, and they entred into <HI>Euphrates,</HI> by the narrow passages of the river, for through that Countrey there was a great way to goe, namely of a yeere and an halfe, and the same Region is called <HI>Arsareth,</HI> &amp;c. 2 <HI>Esdr.</HI> 13. 40. &amp;c. <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Acost. l. 1. c. 9</NOTE> <HI>Acosta</HI> is of opinion that these words thus produced by many, make in truth against this conjecture, and that for two reasons. 1. The ten Tribes went so farre to keepe their statutes and ceremonies, but these Indi|ans observe none of them, being given up to all Idola|tries: And is this at all consequent, such was their pur|pose, therefore the successe must be answerable? is it likely they should be so tenacious in a farre and for|raigne land, that never kept them in their owne, as the next words expresse? His second Argument is of like force, for tis not said, that <HI>Euphrates</HI> and <HI>America</HI> be contiguous, or places so neere one the other, much|lesse that the entries of that River should stretch to the Indies; but hee tells of a very long journey taken by them, suitable to the places of their removall, and ap|proach, which was to a Countrey where never man dwelt, and what Countrey could this be but <HI>America?</HI> all other parts of the world being then knowne and in|habited: Besides there hath bin a common tradition a|mong the Jews, and in the world, that those ten tribes are utterly lost; in what place are they then like to be found if not in <HI>America?</HI> for they shall be found againe.

Their barbarous properties are most like the Tartats of any; this argument mili|tates with more force for their Judaisme, to which ma|ny of their rites be so consonant, both sacred and com|mon, as hath been said. And thirdly the West side of <HI>America,</HI> if it be not continent with <HI>Tartary,</HI> is yet disjoy|ned by a small straite; but the like may be said of some other parts, that they be or may have been neer some o|ther maine lands, and so by that reason of some other race and extract. 4.

<P>THE whole Countrey of Jewry, whence wee would have it probable that the Americans came, is not above one hundred and sixty miles long, from <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>T.</HI> 3. <HI>Ep.</HI> p. 69</NOTE> <HI>Dan</HI> to <HI>Beersheba,</HI> and the breadth is but sixty miles, from <HI>Ioppa</HI> to <HI>Iordan,</HI> in St. <HI>Ieromes</HI> ac|count, who knew it so well; and how some few Colo|nies, as it were removing from thence should multi|ply into such numbers, that so large a Countrey should be filled by them, is a scruple that hath troubled some considering men. <HI>America</HI> in the latitude of it is <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><HI>Lerius.</HI> p. 169.</NOTE> is foure thousand miles; and Bishop <HI>Casa's</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Ante p. hujus 24. n.</NOTE> hath said already, that the Spaniards in his time had forraged and spoyled Countries longer then all <HI>Europe,</HI> and a great part of <HI>Asia;</HI> it seemes incredible therefore that the In|commers, who were but few in comparison, as a little flocke of Kids, should so marvelously spread into all the Westerne World; for the Americans before that Spa|nish devastation, filled all the Countrey.

<P>IF such a passage through <HI>Tartary,</HI> or some other Countrey for them were granted, and the probabi|lity of so numerous multiplication acknowledged, the perswasion will not yet be easie, that Jewes should ever become so barbarous, horrid and inhumane, as bookes generally relate of these Americans.</P>

<P>Wee marvaile at the Americans for their naked|nesse, and man-devouring, we cannot believe the Jewes should be given over to such barbarity: But in our own Nation the Inhabitants were anciently as rude and horrid, <GAP DESC="foreign"> saith <HI>Herodian,</HI> the Britons<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In Sev.</HI> p. 83.</NOTE> knew not the use of apparell, lest their cloathing should hide the severall formes and figures of beasts and other creatures which they paint, and imprint upon their bodies; and <HI>Hierome</HI> saith, when he was a young man, he<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>T.</HI> 2. <HI>Ep.</HI> p. 75.</NOTE> saw the Scots, <HI>Gentem Britannicam humanis vesci carnibus,</HI> and that even here of old were Anthropophagi, is aver|red<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 6.

If when <HI>Moses</HI> was alive, saith he, they were so stubborne and rebellious, and went after other Gods, they may be now much more prodigiously wic|ked, <HI>even as these Americans,</HI> being unknowne to o|ther people, confounded also in their language and life, and God so revenging their abominations. 2.

Yea and before that time there was a lamentable defection of religion in Israell.</P>
<P>While they were in their owne land, for a long sea|son
<PB N="52" REF="48">
they <HI>were without the true God, and without a reading Priest, and without Law,</HI> 2 Chron. 15. 3. yea and as <HI>Chry|sostome</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Chrisost. in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2. m. p. 218.</NOTE> affirmes that the Book of Deuteronomy had been lost along time among Christians, and was lately recovered from dust and rubbish a little before his daies; so tis most certaine that in <HI>Iosiahs</HI> reigne, <HI>Hilkiah</HI> the Priest found the Booke of the Law in the House of the Lord, which when the King heard read unto him, hee was <HI>astonisht, as at a new and strange thing, and rent his clothes,</HI> 2 King, 22. 8. &amp;c. <HI>and this was the Booke of the law of the Lord given by Moses,</HI> 2 Chro. 34. 14. <HI>which was then little knowne or regarded among them,</HI> ver. 24, 25. &amp;c.

</LIST>
<P>Deep considerations, without doubt, and mature, were in those that hence transplanted themselves into that other part of the world, but <HI>quo jure,</HI> by what right and title they could settle in a forraigne land was surely none of their last enquiries. <HI>Io. Bodin</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Meth. Hist.</HI> p. 522.</NOTE> rec|kons five reasons why Colonies may be planted in other Regions. 1. Expulsion from their own native Coun|trey. 2. Increase of inhabitants upon a land. 3. Want of necessaries at home, and unseasonable times. 4. De|sire to preserve and enlarge their owne territories. 5. Favour to prisoners and captives. The ampliation of the Kingdome of Christ was expected here as a mo|tive in vaine; but I finde it elsewhere among our No|vangles, and it shall be mentioned in due place: for those are causes why men goe out of their owne land, but for the <HI>jus</HI> and right of setling in another they say nothing.</P>
<P>When the Bishop <HI>De las Casas</HI> had set forth his tract<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Casas.</HI> p. 134. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> of the Spanish cruelties committed in the Indies, some guilty persons he supposeth suborned Doctor <HI>Sepulveda,</HI> the Emperours Historian, to undertake their patro|nage, which he did in an elegant and rhetoricall dis|course, endeavouring to prove, that the Spanish wars against the Indians were just and lawfull, and that they were bound to submit unto the Spaniards, as Ideots to the more prudent; but he could not obtaine leave to print a booke so irrationall and unchristian.</P>
<P>Their more plausible plea is, that <HI>Columbus</HI> was first employed by them to discover some of those parts; but the same offer was before tendred to this our Nation,
<PB N="56" REF="50">
and the King thereof; yea and the English were as early in that very designe as the Portingales, for our <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><HI>Stow ad An.</HI> 1501, &amp; 1502.</NOTE> Chronicles shew that <HI>Sebastian Gabat</HI> or <HI>Cabot,</HI> borne at <HI>Bristol,</HI> was employed by King <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, and he with some <HI>London</HI> Merchants, adventured three or foure ships into those New-found lands, <HI>Anno</HI> one thousand foure hundred ninety eight; and it cannot be doubted, but they had made some former sufficient ex|periments, before that their so confident engagement: Thence tis affirmed by others <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Purchas. l. 4. c. 13.</NOTE>, that the English were there before <HI>Columbus,</HI> and about the yeere <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Stow.

But wee of this Nation have yet a more ancient claime, three hundred yeeres before <HI>Columbus,</HI> in the time of <HI>Henry</HI> the second, <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> one thou|sand one hundred and seventy; when <HI>Madoc ap Owen Gwineth</HI> did not onely discover the Countrey, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">lan|ted in some part of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and left Monuments of the Brittish language, and other usages, taken notice of by the Spaniands, since their arrivall thither. Mr. <HI>Her|bert</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><HI>L.</HI> 3. p. 360.</NOTE> in his travailes doth not onely remember this, but sheweth it to have bin mentioned by many worthy men of late, and ancient times, as <HI>Cynwic ap Greut, Me|redith ap Rhice, Gul. Owen, Lloyd, Powell, Hackluit, Davis, Broughton.</HI> And <HI>Purchas. l.</HI> 4. <HI>c.</HI> 13. <HI>p.</HI> 807.</P>
<P>But yet more particularly, Dr <HI>Donne</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Sermon to <HI>Virginia</HI> Plan|ters. <HI>An.</HI> 1622. p. 20. 26.</NOTE> allowes that as a justifiable reason of mens removall from one place to another, publique benefit; <HI>Interest Reipublicae ut re sua quis bene utatur,</HI> every one must use his private for
<PB N="57" REF="50">
the common good: and if a State may take order that every man improve what he hath for the benefit of the Nation where he lives, then, <HI>interest mundo,</HI> all man|kinde may every where, as farre as it is able, advance the good of mankinde in generall, which not being done by the Natives there, others are bound, at least have li|berty to interpose their endeavours, especially, when by divine providence one land swells with inhabitants, and another is disempeopled by mutuall broiles, infe|ctious diseases, or the cruelty of Invaders, all which have helped to sweepe away the Americans, while the English in the meane time did multiply in such manner and measure, as they could scarcely dwell one by ano|ther; and because man is commanded more than once to <HI>bring forth, multiply, and fill the earth,</HI> Gen. 1. 28. 9. 1. he may well therefore, and justly looke abroad, and if he finde convenient and quiet habitation, he may call the name of that land <HI>Rehoboth, because the Lord hath made him roome,</HI> Gen. 22. 26. That is also a lawfull cause of setling in other lands, when a right therein is acquired by purchase, as <HI>Abraham bought of Ephron the field of Machpelah,</HI> Gen. 22. 17. And thus <HI>Paspehai</HI> <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Declara. of <HI>Uirginia.</HI> p. 11.</NOTE> one of the Indian Kings sold unto the English in <HI>Vir|ginia</HI> land to inhabit and inherit; and when Mr <HI>Wil|liams</HI> of late <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">M. <HI>Cott.</HI> ans. p. 27&punc; <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> called upon our Planters in New Eng|land to be humbled for making use of the Kings Patents, for removing hence, and residing there, he is well an|swered among other things, that they had those lands from the Natives by way of purchase and free consent. Againe, the Territories of strangers may be possessed upon the donation and fore-gift of the naturall Inhabi|tants, as <HI>Abimelech</HI> said to <HI>Abraham, behold the land is before thee, dwell where it pleaseth thee,</HI> Gen. 20. 15. and

<HI>Pharaoh</HI> said to <HI>Ioseph, in the land of Goshen let thy father and brethren dwell,</HI> Gen. 47. 5, 6. So in <HI>Virginia</HI> King <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Declara. of <HI>Virgin.

The English in|vaded the Britons the ancient inhabitants of this Island, and crowded them into the nooke of <HI>Wales,</HI> themselves in the meane time taking possession of the fat of this Land; by what right, or by what wrong I dispute not, saith <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Metrop. 129.</NOTE> <HI>Crantzius;</HI> but such in those daies were the frequent emigrations of people to seeke out new habi|tations.</P>
<P>To these that other expression of the eloquent Deane <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Ibid:</NOTE> may be added, <HI>accepistis potestatem,</HI> you have your Commissions, your Patents, your Charters, your Seale from that soveraigne power upon whose acts any private subject in civill matters may rely; and though our forenamed Country-man seemeth to slight the Pattent of New-England, as containing matter of falsehood and injustice, that <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib.</HI> Mr <HI>Cott.</HI></NOTE> imputation also is sufficiently removed by Mr <HI>Cotton</HI> in that his answer be|fore mentioned.

<P>SAint <HI>Paul</HI> enforced himselfe to preach the Gospell where <HI>Christ was not yet named,</HI> Rom. 15. 20. such is the condition of that forlorne Nation, a good subject to worke upon, and if so good an end be pro|pounded, the successe by divine blessing will be answe|rable: and though the Countrey hath been knowne more than a Century of yeeres to Christians, yet those that came first among them, minded nothing lesse than to make them such. <HI>Benzo</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Benzo.</HI> p. 76. 77. <HI>possimqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">.</HI></NOTE> relates abundantly how the Spaniards laid the foundation of their endea|vours in bloud, their Fryers and religious persons at first instigating them thereto.

they destinate all the Nations to bitter bondage, pro|ceeding therein with so much rigour and severity, that the Dominicans are constrained at length to complaine thereof to the Pope <HI>Paul</HI> the third, imploring from him a Bull for the reinfranchisement of the Indians, which they obtained, and brought into <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">aine,</HI> and presented it to <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, who made them free to the griefe and losse of some of the Grandees, whose wealth and grandour consisted most in slaves; they were most pro|digiously libidinous <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Id. p. 11. &amp;c.</NOTE> also, contracting upon them|selves most foule and pernicious diseases, that loath|some lust first brought into this world, the filthy and infectious contagion, now so much spoken of. Their covetousnesse was notorious also, the Indians scorned them for it, and for their sakes abominated the name of Christianity; and when they tooke any <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><HI>Id.</HI> p. 100. 104. 248. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> of the Spaniards, they would bind their hands, cast them up|on their backs, and poure gold into their mouths, say|ing, Eate, O Christians, eate this gold: Yea their lives were generally so odious, and opposite to godli|nesse, that the same writer professeth, their scandalous conversation deterred the Americans from the Gospell; they did indeed teach some children of their Kings and Nobles, to read, and write, and understand the princi|ples of Christianity, which they acknowledged to be good, and wondered that the Christians themselves so little practised them; and thus one of them bespake a <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Id. ibid. &amp;c.</NOTE> Spaniard, O Christian thy God forbids thee to take his name in vaine, and yet thou swearest upon eve|ry light occasion, and forswearest; your God saith, you shall not beare false witnesse, and you doe nothing else almost but slander, and curse one another; your God commands you to love your neighbour as your selfe,

but how are the poore injured by you? how doe you cast them into prison, and fetters, that are not able to pay their debts? and you are so farre from relieving needy Christians, that you send them to our cottages for almes, spending your meanes and time in dice, thefts, contentions, and adulteries: He tells also of an Indian Prince, that was very apt and ingenious, he attained to a very good measure of learning and knowledge in reli|gion, and was hopefull above others in both; but a|bout the thirtieth yeere of his age, he deceived the ex|pectation of friends, and became extremely debauched and impious, and being blamed for his bad change, his excuse was, since I became a Christian I have learned all this, to sweare by the name of God, to blaspheme the holy Gospell, to lie, to play at dice; I have gotten a sword also to quarrell, and that I may be a right Chri|stian indeed, I want nothing but a concubine, which I intend also shortly to bring home to my house; And <HI>Benzo</HI> further addes, when himselfe reprehended an In|dian for dicing and blaspemy <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><HI>Id.</HI> p. 251.</NOTE>, hee was presently answered, I learned this of you Christians, &amp;c.

<P>IT is the unfeigned desire of every pious soule, that God would please to guide and blesse some holy and happy hand, in taking up the differences that are growne up among those that are named by the sweet name of Christ, that all who love the Lord Jesus in sincerity, would also sincerely love one another; that mutuall forces were conjoyned to promote the glo|ry of our common Master, not onely every man in his owne person, family, place, and Countrey, but by ap|prehending all opportunities to publish the eternall Gospell of our Lord even to those other ends of the earth. <HI>Gregory</HI> the great <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">In <HI>Bed.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> The Novangles religious care to advance Piety and Learning.</HEAD>
<P>IT hath been laid and left at the doores of those whom some call Independents here in this <HI>England,</HI> that they have shewed little love to others going astray, and that their zeale hath been wanting against those blas|phemies and heresies that have manifestly dishonoured the most sweet and holy name of God, Father, Son, and Spirit. Our booke tells us of <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Agathen <HI>in</HI> Doroth. Doctr. &amp; vita patrum.</NOTE> a good man in former times when hee was accused of lust, pride, &amp;c. He said, I confesse I am a sinner, and I beseech you pray for me, but when they laid heresie to his charge, his heart was hot within him, his zeale was inflamed, and hee said, <HI>Haereticus non sum, &amp; hoc vitium nulla pa|tientia possum aut volo dissimulare, hoeresis enim separat hominem a Deo, &amp; adsocrat Diabolo: alienatus a Christo non habet Deum, quem oret propeccatis suis.

<P>At the title of haeresie, <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">p. 24.</NOTE> this is the preface. Al|though no humane power be Lord over the faith and consciences of men, and therefore may not constraine them to believe or professe against their consciences, yet because such as bring in damnable heresies, tending to the subversion of the Christian Faith, and the de|struction of the soules of men, ought duly to be restrai|ned from such notorious impiety, it is therefore ordered and decreed by this Court:</P>
<P>That if any Christian within this jurisdiction shall goe about to subvert and destroy the Christian Faith and Religion, by broaching or maintaining any dam|nable herefie, as denying the immortality of the soule, or the resurrection of the body, or any sinne to be re|pented of in the regenerate, or any evill done by the

And before <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><HI>Tit. Ecclesi|asticall.</HI> p. 19. 20</NOTE> having said, that the open contempt of Gods word, and the messengers thereof is the desolating sinne of civill States, &amp;c. It is therefore ordered, and decreed, That if a|ny christian, so called, within this jurisdiction, shall con|temptuously behave himself towards the word preached, or the messengers thereof&mdash;either by interrupting him in his preaching, or by charging him falsely with any error, which he hath not taught, or like a son of <HI>Korah</HI> cast upon his true doctrine, or himselfe, any reproach&mdash;every such person or persons (whatsoever censure the Church may passe) shall for the first scandall be con|vented and reproved openly by the Magistrate at some Lecture, and bound to their good behaviour, and if a second time they breake forth into the like contemptu|ous carriages, they shall either pay five pounds to the publique treasury, or stand two houres openly upon a blocke or stoole foure foot high on a Lecture day with a paper fixed on his breast, written in capitall letters, AN OPEN AND OBSTINATE CONTEM|NER OF GODS HOLY ORDINANCES, that others may feare and be ashamed of breaking out into the like wickednesse. 1646.</P>
<P>There be some in this <HI>England</HI> that account it piety and Religion to speake evill of Christs Ministers, and
<PB N="100" REF="72">
cast off his Ordinances; now blessed of God from hea|ven and earth be our Novangles, Magistrates, Ministers, and people that have so seasonably witnessed against these abominations.</P>
<P>They are great lovers of peace and government, these therefore be their words in another place; <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><HI>Tit. Anabap|tists.</HI> p. 1.</NOTE> For as much as experience hath plentifully &amp; often proved that since the first rising of the Anabaptists about an hun|dred yeeres past they have bin the Incendiaries of Com|mon-wealths, and the infectors of persons in maine matters of Religion, and the troublers of Churches in most places where they have been, and that they who have held the baptizing of infants unlawfull, have usual|ly held other errors or heresies together therewith (though as heretiques use to doe they have concealed the same untill they espied a fit advantage and opportunity to vent them by way of question or scruple) and whereas divers of this kinde have since our comming into New-England appeared amongst our selves, some whereof, as others before them, have denyed the Ordinance of Magistracy, and the lawfulnesse of making warre, o|thers the lawfulnesse of Magistrates and their inspe|ction into any breach of the first Table, which o|pinions, if connived at by us, are like to be increased among us, and so necessarily bring guilt upon us, infe|ction and trouble to the Churches, and hazard to the whole Common-wealth: It is therefore ordered by this Court and authority thereof, that if any person or persons shall either openly condemne or oppose the baptizing of infants, or goe about secretly to seduce o|thers from the approbation, or use thereof, or shall purposely depart the Congregation at the administra|tion of that Ordinance, or shall deny the Ordinance of

<P>And that wee may discerne how worthy they are that wee should doe all the good wee can for them, for they love the nation where they inhabite, and are very seri|ous in <HI>preparing them for one husband, to present them a pure virgin unto Christ,</HI> 2 Cor. 11. 2. Severall there|fore are their decrees in order to their conversion.</P>
<P><NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg"><HI>Tit.</HI> Indians&punc; p. 28, 29.</NOTE> 1. Every Towne shall have power to restraine all Indians from prophaning the Lords day. 1633. 1639. 1641.</P>
<P>2. The English shall not destroy the Indians corne&punc; but shall help them to fence in their grounds.</P>
<P>3. Considering one end in planting these parts was to propagate the true Religion unto the Indians, and that divers of them are become subjects to the English, and have engaged themselves to be willing and ready to un|derstand the Law of God; It is therefore ordered and decreed, that such necessary and wholesome Lawes which are in force, and may be made from time to time, to reduce them to civility of life, shall be once in the yeer (if the times be safe) made knowne to them, by such fit persons as the generall Court shall nominate, having the helpe of some able Interpreter.</P>
<P>4. Considering also that interpretation of tongues is appointed of God for propagating the truth; It is therefore decreed that two Ministers shall be chosen e|very yeer, and sent with the consent of their Churches (with whomsoever will freely offer themselves to ac|company
<PB N="102" REF="73">
them in that service) to make knowne the heavenly counsell of God among the Indians, and that something be allowd them by the Generall Court to give away freely to those Indians whom they shall perceive most willing and ready to be instructed by them.</P>
<P>5. They decree further that no Indian shall at any time Powaw, or performe outward worship to their false gods, or to the devill, and if any shall transgresse this law, the Powawer shall pay 5 l. the procurer 5 l. &amp;c. 1646.</P>
<P>Their love to learning also is meet to be remembred, and encouraged, wherein they have <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg"><HI>Tit. Sch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">els.</HI> p. 47.</NOTE> observed a chief project of that old deluder Satan to keepe men from the knowledge of the Scriptures, as in former times kee|ping them in an unknowne tongue, so in these latter times by perswading from the use of tongues, that so at least the true sense and meaning of the originall might be clouded with false glosses of saint-seeming deceivers, and that learning may not be buried in the graves of our forefathers in Church and Common-wealth, the Lord assisting our endeavours, It is therefore ordered by this Court and authority thereof, That every Town|ship encreasing to the number of fifty housholds, shall appoint one within their Towne to teach all such chil|dren as shall resort to him, to write and read, whose wages shall be paid either by the Parents or Masters of such children, or by the Inhabitants in generall by way of supply, as the major part of those that order the Pru|dentialls of the Towne shall appoint, and where any town shall encrease to an hundred families or househoul|ders, they shall set up a Grammer school, the Masters thereof being able to instruct youth so far, as they may

be fitted for the University, and if any town neglect this above a yeere, every such Towne shall pay five pound <HI>per ann.</HI> to the next such Schoole, till they shall performe this order. 1647.</P>
<P>And an Academy or University is not onely in their aime, but a good while since they had more than begun well, and therefore wee read these words in another <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg"><HI>Tit.

the things of their peace, they were conducted into the principall Wigwam of <HI>Waaubon,</HI> their chiefe minister of justice, who like another <HI>Cornelius,</HI> Act. 10. 24. <HI>had called together</HI> many men, women, and children to hear and learne, they began with prayer in English, not for want of language, but to shew them the duty was sa|cred,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Page. 1. &amp;.</NOTE> and that wee might agree together in the same heart-sorrowes for them, even in that place where God was never wont to be called upon: It was an affecting spectacle, after prayer, to see a company of forlorne outcasts diligently attending upon the word of salvati|on, which in the space of an houre and a quarter disco|vered to them the grounds of Religion, repeating, ex|pounding, and applying the ten Commandements, then preaching Jesus Christ the onely meanes of reco|very from sinne and wrath, perswading them to repen|tance for severall sinnes which they live in. Wee next<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 3.</NOTE> asked them if they understood what was spoken, which they affirmed with many voices, and then wee desired to know if they would propound any questions to us, for their further satisfaction, and this they did, but not such curiosities as some others of them had done before, as, <HI>what was the cause of thunder, of the ebbing and flowing</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Questions o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> the Indians.</NOTE> <HI>of the sea, of the wind:</HI> no, the wisdome of God directed them to aske, <HI>How wee may come to know Iesus Christ?</HI> one of them after wee had answered, said, hee was praying in his Wigwam to Christ that hee would give him a<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 4.</NOTE> new heart, but another Indian interrupted him, saying, hee prayed in vaine, because Christ understood not what Indians speake in prayer, as not being acquainted with their language, his question therefore was, <HI>Whe|ther Iesus Christ did understand the prayers of Indians?</HI> a|nother demanded, if <HI>English men were once so ignorant of</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 5.</NOTE>
<PB N="106" REF="75">
<HI>Christ as themselves?</HI> and <HI>how can there be an image of God, seeing it is forbiden in the second Commandement?</HI> If <HI>the father be bad, and the child good, will God be offen|ded with that child? for tis said in the second commande|ment, hee will visit the sinnes of the fathers upon the chil|dren? How is all the world become so full of people, being all</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 6.</NOTE> <HI>were once drowned in the floud?</HI></P>
<P>Wee then asked them three questions. 1. If they<NOTE PLACE="marg">Questions to them.</NOTE> did not desire to see God, and if they were not tempted to thinke there was no God, because they could not see him? some of them replyed they did indeed desire to see him, but we had taught them that could not be, yet they believed, though their eyes could not see him, hee was to be seen with their soules within. 2. Wee as|ked if it were not strange to them there should be but one God, yet this God should be in <HI>Massachusets, Co|nectacut, Quimipenik,</HI> in old England, in this <HI>Wigwam,</HI> in the next, every where? It is strange one of them said, as all else is we hear preached; yet they thought it might<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 7.</NOTE> be true that God was so big every where. 3. Whether they did not finde something troubling them within af|ter the commission of sinne, as murther, adultery, theft, lying, &amp;c. they confest the trouble, but could not tell what to say to it, he therefore that first spake to them concluded with a dolefull description (as far as his language permitted) of the trembling condition of e|very soule that dies in sinne, and shall be cast out of fa|vour from God. Having thus spent three houres, wee asked them if they were not weary, they said no, wee resolved to leave them with an appetite; the chiefe of them seeing us conclude with prayer, desired to know when wee would come againe, wee appointed the time, gave the children some Apples, and the men
<PB N="107" REF="75">
what was at hand, they asked more ground to build a Towne together, which wee liked well, and promising our furtherance for them at the Generall Court, wee departed with many welcomes from them.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 11. 1646, Wee came againe to the same<NOTE PLACE="marg">Second com|ming.</NOTE> Wigwam, there was a greater concourse, and seats pro|vided for us, wee began againe with prayer in English, and then catechized the younger sort, wee asked them<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 8.</NOTE> onely three questions in their own language. 1. Who made you and all the world? 2. Who shall save you from sinne and hell? 3. How many commandements hath God given you to keepe? The Preacher then pro|ceeded, Wee are come to bring you good newes from the great God, and to shew how evill men may come to be good, and be happy while they live, and goe to God when they die; then in familiar descriptions hee set forth God to them in his glorious power, goodnesse and greatnesse, shewing what his will was, and what he required, even of the Indians, in the ten Commande|ments, and how angry God was for any sinne, yet that hee sent Christ to die for their transgressions, and to pacifie God by suffering in their roome, if they did re|pent and believe the Gospell, and that hee would love the poore Indians if now they sought God, threatning wrath against all such as stood out and neglected so great salvation, &amp;c. In hearing these things about sinne, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 9.</NOTE> hell, and Christ, one of them shewed much affliction, desiring to conceale his griefe; about an houre thus spent, wee desired them to propound some questions, and the first was by an old man, <HI>If it were not to late for</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Questions.</NOTE> <HI>such an old man as hee to repent and seeke after God?</HI> which cleared, 2. They demanded, <HI>How the English came to differ so much from the Indians in knowledge, seeing at</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 10.</NOTE>
<PB N="108" REF="76">
<HI>first they had all one father?</HI> 3. Being satisfied in this also, they said, <HI>How may wee come to serve God?</HI> which being answered, their fourth question was, <HI>Why the seawater was salt, and the land water fresh?</HI> and their fifth, <HI>If the</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 11.</NOTE> <HI>water be higher then the earth, why did it not overflow it?</HI> a Philosophicall answer was given to this, and they conferred much among themselves about these questi|ons, but night hasting wee desired them to proceed, thereupon one of them said, <HI>If a man hath committed a|dultery,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 12.</NOTE> <HI>or stollen goods, and the Sachim doth not punish him, and hee restore the goods, is not all well, will no punish|ment come from God, as if restitution made God amends?</HI> this answered, wee asked two things. 1. What doe<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 13.</NOTE> you remember of that spoken to you the last time wee were here? after some speech among themselves, one of them said, They did much thank&punc; God for our comming, and the things they heard were wonderfull to them; then Secondly&punc; wee said, Do you believe the things we tell you, and that God is <HI>Musquantum, i. e.</HI> very angry for the least sinne in your thoughts, or words, or works? they said yes, and we spake further of the terrors of God against sinners, and his mercy to the penitent, seeking after Christ; night being almost come, considering the Indians desired to know how to pray, and thought that Christ did not understand their language, one of us ther|fore prayed in their tongue above a quarter of an houre, divers of them holding up eyes and hands, and one of them hung downe his head, with his rag before his eyes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A weeping In|dian.</NOTE> which when hee had wiped, hee held up his head againe, yet such was the power of God upon his heart, that hee hung downe his head againe, covered his eyes, wiping them and weeping abundantly, till prayer was ended,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 14.</NOTE> then hee turned to a corner of the Wigwam, and wept
<PB N="109" REF="76">
more by himselfe, which one of us perceiving, spake encouraging words, hee then wept more and more; when he came out of the Wigwan, wee spake to him a|gaine, hee then fell into more abundant weeping, like one deepely affected, so as wee could not forbeare wee|ping over him also; wee departed greatly rejoycing for such sorrowing. And while I am transcribing this, I know not whether first, to pitty the poore Natives in their spirituall distres, or sympathize with the English in their holy compassion, or praise God more for dis|covering to the Indians their lost condition by n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ture, or that hee hath made our Countreymen so industrious in recovering them out of it; however I cannot but re|mind my Reader of the relators observations hereupon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Observations.</NOTE> at least some of them.</P>

<P>There be sundry of them begin to enquire after Bap|tisme and Church Ordinances, and Mr. <HI>Elliot</HI> with con|sideration speakes solemnly not suddenly, nor lightly, but before the Lord, As I apprehend, saith he, in my conscience, were they but in a setled way of civility and government, cohabiting together, and I called, accor|ding to God, to live among them, I durst freely joyne into Church fellowship with them, and could find out at least twenty men and women in some measure fitted of the Lord for it. That Indian that was Mr <HI>Elliots</HI> In|terpreter, and first taught him words, was joyning him|selfe to the Church of <HI>Dorchester,</HI> and the very day of this writing was the day for the triall of that Indian in order to his admission, and this was 2. of the 12. 1648. Since which time these labourers with the Lord have not been idle in this Vineyard, they are digging, and fencing, and gathering out the stones thereof, and plan|ting it with the choisest vine, &amp;c. <HI>Esa.</HI> 5. 2. and though some informations of their happy endeavours have un|happily miscarried, there be other passages that have arrived hither, to give us assurance that they wax not faint in that Gospel worke, they are not indeed yet printed, but I have obtained leave to give the Reader a little taste thereof, for as we here long to understand what further footsteps be made, so the discoveries there|of will in due time and better manner be recommended.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="83">Mr <HI>Elliot</HI> in the beginning of the last spring prepared<NOTE PLACE="marg">Letter to Mr <HI>Winslow.</HI> 18. of the 8. 1649.</NOTE> for his journey among the Indians, to a great fishing place upon <HI>Merimak,</HI> and hired an Indian to mark trees, and pilot him thither, which he did, with the helpe of some Indians, they passed by other of the Natives, who had heard of his preaching, and were very glad of his comming that way, but sicknesse prevented him at that time; howbeit upon his recovery, he went to another place call'd <HI>Pantukct,</HI> where from all parts they meet, there he asked them if those Indians were desirous to pray to God, and when they said yea, he demanded how many desired it, they answered <HI>Wam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e, i. e.</HI> all. The chiefe Sachim of this place had heard him before, and now shewed great affection to him, and the word of God, using many arguments to perswade him to tarry among them, saying, his comming but once a yeere did them little good, it was as if one should come and throw a fine thing among them, and they like it well, but can|not tell what is within, whether something, or nothing, but if it be opened and they see it precious, they should believe it, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Another Indian learning from Mr. <HI>Elliot</HI> that hee had five sonnes, asked him if they should all teach the Indians to know God, as he did, which when hee affir|med, the other was well pleased, and Mr. <HI>Elliot</HI> him|selfe much encouraged, for hee had often dedicated them in his prayers to that service of the Lord, desi|ring no better preferment for them, than to be fitted for that worke, hee endeavours therefore with that smal meanes he hath to traine them up in learning, and God will I doubt not raise up some liberall hearts and hands to assist him therein.</P>
<P>This summer hee was making another journey, but
<PB N="123" REF="83">
in regard of some quarrells among the Indians, the Church was doubtfull at first of his going, which when the <HI>Nashaway</HI> Sachim heard, he took twenty men armed after their manner, and was his guard, with many o|ther neerer Indians, so much do they hunger after instru|ction; this was a long journey into the wildernesse of sixty miles, it proved very wet and tedious, so that hee was not dry three or foure daies together night nor day, but the Lord upheld him and his company in strength and health. One of the Indians would needs know of Mr <HI>Elliot</HI> the reason why they that pray to God, love the Indians so doing, more than their owne Brethren, and when the rest of them said they all found it so in their hearts, this gave him occasion to discourse to them of the unity of the spirit.

<P>About two yeeres and an halfe agoe, the said <HI>Monteri|nos</HI> going from the port of <HI>Honda</HI> in the West Indies&punc; to go to the Government of <HI>Papian</HI> in the Province of <HI>Qui|to,</HI> did hire some M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">les of a certaine Indian Mystique, called <HI>Francis du Chasteau,</HI> in which company, together with other Indians, went a certaine owner of Mules who was also called <HI>Francis,</HI> whom all the Indians named Cacique, to whom it fell out, passing over the moun|taine <HI>Cordecilla,</HI> in a day of great winde and raine, that their carriages fell to the ground, whereat the Indians being grieved, as also at the evill weather, they begin to
<PB N="130" REF="87">
complaine of their ill fortune, saying that they deserved all that, and more also for their sinnes, which the said <HI>Francis</HI> hearing answered, that they should have pati|ence, that shortly they should have rest; whereunto they answered that they deserved it not, having used the holy people so ill, and the most noble of all the Nations in the world; but contrariwise that all the cruelties which the Spaniards had used against them did befall unto them for the expiating of that sin; after they were gone a little while, they stopt upon the Mountaine to rest, and passe the night season, at which time the fore|said <HI>Monterinos</HI> did take out of a box some few biskets, some cheese and sweet-meates, and offered some to the foresaid <HI>Francis,</HI> saying to him, take this though thou dost speake evill of the Spaniards, whereunto hee an|swered, that he had not told the halfe of the hard usage which they received from that cruell and inhumane Na|tion; but that after a short space they should see them|selves avenged upon them by a hidden Nation: after these discourses between them, M^r <HI>Monterinos</HI> arrived at the Town of <HI>Cartagena</HI> in the Indies, where he was ta|ken by the Inquisition and put in prison; one day pray|ing unto God, hee uttered these words, Blessed be the name of <HI>Adonay,</HI> that hee hath not made me an Idola|ter, a Barbarian, an Ethiopian, nor an Indian; and pronouncing the name of Indian hee reproved himselfe, saying the Hebrewes are Indians; and then comming againe to himselfe said, am not I a foole, how can it bee that the Hebrewes should be Indians? the same fell out the second and third day, making the same prayer and giving the same thankes unto God, whence hee ga|thered that that fancie did not come to him by meere chance, remembring also that which passed between
<PB N="131" REF="87">
him and the aforesaid Indian; so that hee tooke an oath hee would so informe himselfe of the whole matter, that hee should know the truth, and that comming out of prison hee should instantly seeke the Indian, and would bring to his minde the discourse which they had together, to obtaine by that meanes the satisfaction of his desires. Being then come out of prison by the good|nesse of God, he went to the forenamed Port of <HI>Honda,</HI> where hee had so much good lucke that hee found in|stantly the foresaid Indian, to whom he made his appli|cation, and brought into his memory the discourse which they had upon the Mountaine, whereunto he an|swered that he had not forgotten it, which <HI>Monterinos</HI> hearing, said that he would goe a journey with him, to which hee answered that hee was ready to doe him ser|vice: So the said <HI>Monterinos</HI> gave him three Pataques to buy some provision; whiles then they followed their journey and talked together, the said <HI>Monterinos</HI> at last discovered himselfe unto the said Indian, and told him in these words, I am an Hebrew of the tribe of <HI>Levi,</HI> my God is <HI>Adonay,</HI> and all the rest are nothing but mis|takes and deceites; whereat the Indian being some|what surprized, did aske him the name of his predeces|sors, whereunto hee did answer that they were called <HI>Abraham, Isaac, Iacob</HI> and <HI>Israel,</HI> which the Indian hearing, did aske of him whether hee had none other Father, hee said yea, and that hee was called <HI>Lodwick</HI> of <HI>Monterinos;</HI> but the Indian being not well satisfied as yet, said these words unto him, on the one side I did re|joyce at that which thou hast said unto me, and on the other I am resolving to disbelieve thee, because thou canst not tell mee who were thy Fathers, whereunto the said <HI>Monterinos</HI> answered with an oath, that the thing
<PB N="132" REF="88">
which hee said was truth, having spent some time in questions and answers, and the Indian being wearied at the matter said to him, art thou not the sonne of <HI>Israell,</HI> to which he answered, yea, which the Indian having heard said, make an end then of thy sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ch, for certainly thou didst put me in such a confusion that I would have been perplexed at it all my life time; nevertheles let us rest a little and drinke, and then follow on our discourse. After a little space, the Indian said unto him, if thou hast the courage and boldnesse to follow me, thou shalt know all what thou desirest, but I tell thee before hand thou must go a foot and eate roasted Mayz, and do that which I shall bid thee; the said <HI>Monterinos</HI> answered, that hee would not at all transgresse his orders; the day following which was Monday, the Indian came to the said <HI>Monterinos,</HI> and bid him take out all that which he had in his pockets, put on his Alpergatas (these are a certaine sort of shooes which the Indians weare) and take this staffe and follow him, which the said <HI>Monteri|nos</HI> did, leaving his cloake and his sword and all what hee had, and so they followed on their way, the Indian car|rying on his backe three measures of roasted Mayz, two ropes, the one made with knots and an hooke with two teeth to climbe up by the Mountaine, and the other un|tied, to be made use of in the Marshes and passages of Rivers, with a little Axe and the Alpergatas; they went then after this manner the whole weeke till Saturday on which they rested, and returned to follow their course the whole Sunday and Monday; on Thursday about eight of the clocke they came to a River as broad as the <HI>Duero</HI> in <HI>Spaine,</HI> and the Indian said unto him thou shalt here see thy Brethren, and making a flag of two peeces of Cotten cloath which were their girdles, made a signe,
<PB N="133" REF="88" MS="y">
after which they saw a great smoake, and in a moment afterward the same signe with another flagge; and it was not long after that they saw in a Boat comming to them three men and one woman, which being arrived to the banke of the River, the woman leapt a shoare, and the men tarried in the Boate, which after a long discourse which shee had with the Indian, which the said <HI>Mon|terinos</HI> could not at all understand, went back to the Boate, and told the three men all that shee had heard of the Indian, which came instantly out of the Boate (ha|ving alwaies lookt with attention upon him, <HI>viz.</HI> the said <HI>Monterinos</HI>) and did embrace him, and the woman did the like; after this one of the three men went backe againe to the Boate, and the other two together with the woman did stay there; which comming neer unto the Indian hee did prostrate himselfe at their feete, and they received him with demonstrations of civility and affe|ction, and begun to talke with him; after a little while the Indian said to M^r <HI>Monterinos,</HI> be not amazed, and doe not believe that these men will tell thee a second thing, before thou hast well understood the first; the two men instantly put him between them, and told him the verse following in Hebrew out of <HI>Deut.</HI> Chap. 6. vers. 4. <HI>Semah Israel Adonay Elohim Adonay Ehad, Heare O Israel the Lord our God is one Lord;</HI> and hee in|forming himselfe of every thing by the Indian Interpre|ter, and learning to say it in the Spanish tongue, the two men told him that which followeth, putting a little space of time between one sentence and another.</P>

</LIST>
<P>These discourses being all ended, which lasted all that day, they came backe and told him the same Wednes|day and Thursday, not adding a word more thereunto. And <HI>Monterinos</HI> being wearied, that they answered him nothing to that which hee asked, and that they would not permit him to passe the River, did draw neere the Boate in a dissembling way, and would have cast him|selfe therein to goe to the other side, but they thrust her from the shoare with a staffe, and the said <HI>Monte|rinos</HI> falling into the water hee was in danger of being drowned, because he could not swimme; the men cast themselves suddenly into the water, and drew him out, and shewing themselves angry, said unto him, doe not
<PB N="135" REF="89">
think that thou wilt bring to passe thy purpose by force; which the Indian declared unto him, and they shewed unto him by signes and words.</P>
<P>Notice is to be taken that the Boat for the space of those three daies did not at all stay in one place, but four men went and foure other came, which all of them said the same nine things which we have mentioned, being all the men who during that time came to see him, about 300 more or lesse.</P>
<P>These men are somewhat burnt with the Sunne, some of them weare their haire to their knees, some others shorter, and others as wee use to weare it, faire bodies, good countenances, well made of foot and leg, with a lin|nen about their heads.</P>
<P>Moreover the said M^r <HI>Monterinos</HI> declared, that go|ing from that place on Thursday at night with a great deale of provision which they brought to him, he tooke his leave of them, having been entertained by them, during the three daies which he staied there; and having shewed him how they enjoyed all things which the Spa|niards have in the Indies, aswell of meates as of other things needfull for the life of man. Being come the same day to the place where they had lien the night be|fore, M^r <HI>Monterinos</HI> said to the Indian, <HI>Francis,</HI> thou dost know that my Brethren said unto me that thou shouldest tell me something, therefore I pray thee tell it now to satisfie my desire, whereunto the Indian said, I shall tell thee what I know, if thou wilt not anger mee, and shall relate unto thee the truth so as I have heard it from my Ancestors, but if thou dost vex me (which I apprehend, perceiving thee to be so speculatif) thou wilt oblige me to tell thee lies; so then I beseech thee take onely heed to what I shall say unto thee.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="90">Thy Brethren the sonnes of <HI>Israel</HI> were by divine pro|vidence brought into these Countrys, God doing many miracles for them, which thou wouldst not believe, if I should tell them to thee as I have heard them of my Fathers; Wee Indians went into those Countries and made warre against them, and did use them worse then the Spaniards doe us: Afterwards by the command of our Mohanes (these are their Sorcerers) wee went as Souldiers towards those parts where thou hast seen thy Brethren, to wage warre with them, and of all those that entred there, not one came backe againe alive; wee made a great Armie, and entring into his lands, all fell downe dead, so that not one escaped; at last wee raised another Army, for the making of which the Countrey was dispeopled wholly, so that none but old men, wo|men and children remained therein, which came to an end as the former had done; which those who remained alive, and were not gone to that warre perceiving, said, that the Mohanes had deceived them and were the cause of the death of their Fathers, for which they deserved to be put to death, having then killed many of them, those that remained alive did intreat them to hearken to them, and they would discover to them all the truth of that which they knew, which having gotten leave, declared that which followeth.</P>
<P>The God of these sonnes of <HI>Israel</HI> is the true God, all that is written in his stories is true, they shall be Lords of all the world in the latter end, a people shall come hither which will bring many things to you, and when the land shall be well provided, these sonnes of <HI>Israel</HI> shall goe out of their habitations, and shall become Lords of all the earth as it was theirs before, if you will be happy joyne your selves to them. The Indian ha|ving
<PB REF="90">
made an end to relate the prediction of the Mo|hanes, followed on his discourse after this manner, My Fathers were Caciques, and there are yet four of them. These 5 Caciques then having heard what the Mohanes had foretold, as if they had been some of the Sages of the Hebrewes, came and tooke their habitation neere that place, to see if they could get acquaintance with some of thy Brethren. They satisfied their desire after a long&punc;time by the intercession of an Indian woman: be|cause thy Brethren would never speake to our Fathers, and he of us that went into their Lands, did fall downe dead, and none of thy Brethren did passe over to us; we therefore made a League with them, by the meanes of that woman, under these conditions. First, that five men, sonnes to five Caciques or their successors, should come to visit them every seventy Moones, and that none should come with them. Secondly, that the man to whom the secret was to be declared, should be three hundred Moones old, and that nothing of this should be revealed to him in a place inhabited, but on|ly in the open field, and when it should be revealed, that it should be in the company of all the Caciques; thus then (said the Indian) wee keepe this secreet a|mongst us, for the great reward which wee hope, for the innumerable services which wee have done to thy Brethren. Wee cannot go to see them, but from seventy to seventy Moones, if no new thing fall out; there hath not been any in my time except thy arrivall which they have so much desired and waited for. I finde no more but three new things according to my reckoning; the first, the arrivall of the Spaniards in these Countries, the second that Ships arrived in the
<PB REF="91">
South sea, and the third is thy arrivall. Of all three they have greatly rejoyced, for they say that the Prophecies do come to passe.</P>
<P>Moreover the said <HI>Monterinos</HI> declared, that after|ward hee came to <HI>Honda,</HI> where the said Indian did bring to him three Indian young men, not telling him their names, till hee told him that hee might speake freely with them, seeing they were his companions, whith whom hee was in league, and that the other namely the fift was old, and for that cause was not a|ble to come. The three Indians did imbrace him af|fectionately, and asked him of what Nation hee was; to whom hee answered, that hee was of the Hebrew Nation, of the Tribe of <HI>Levi;</HI> and then they imbra|ced him the second time, and said to him, Thou shalt see us one day, and shalt not know us, wee are thy Bre|thren by a speciall favour which God hath shewed us, and having saluted him they went away: the Indian <HI>Francis</HI> bid him also farewell, and that hee went to speak with his Brethren in the company of the other Caciques. As concerning this Countrey, wee have all the Indians at our command, and when wee shall have made an end of these cruell Spaniards, wee shall goe and draw you out of the slavery wherein you are, if it please God; which he will permit, because his word cannot faile.</P>
