Notwithstanding mine own priuate iudgement &amp; resolution, mistake me not, I can very well digest the publishing of other mens la|bours.</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Plut.

I iustly ranke my selfe amongst the later sort, and would haue followed the counsell that I giue to others, but that I am weyed against my owne mind by such reasons as I hope wil passe for weighty in the iudgements of others as wel as of my selfe. When by the commandement of the right reuerend Father in God, the Lord Bishop of London (by whom I was and euer will gladly be commanded) I was called vnto this seruice, and deliuered this sermon in that honourable presence where it was bestowed, I found that it was swoln farre too bigge for the time al|lotted to that exercise: which might by me haue been more fitly proportioned to the time, if I had endeuoured (as heretofore I haue done) to drawe my speech into knots and borders, and set my words checkerwise for the delight of the eare only. But I thanke my good God, who hath set me in the country to be schooled by expe|rience (which teacheth fooles and all) at whose hands I haue learned to intend not mine owne credit, but the glory of my great Master, and the soules health of the Lambes of his little flocke.

<P><HI>These are the reasons which induce me to present that vnto the eye, in his full shape and proportion, which came maimed vnto the eare, and much abbridged for want of time. Vnto mine own purpose, for publishing hereof, there hath not wan|ted the concurrence of the desires of men of good sort and ranke.

As if the Prophet should haue sayd, O ye men of Isra|el, especially you of the house of <HI>Ephraim,</HI> concupiscence boiling within you hath made you hot as an ouen. Kings, and Iudges haue been your fuell, you haue not called vp|on the Lord: by reason of the mixture of your selues a|mong the people, you haue been tainted with idolatrie, partly rawe and partly rosted, you haue had a knee for God, and a knee for Baal: you might haue beene warned by the inuasion of strangers and by the approche of olde age, yet you haue beene possessed with blinde and lame, and lumpish spirits, for I obserue your dulnesse, and your slownesse, and your simplicitie: you haue beene without eyes not knowing: without feete not returning: without hearts, and as a doue deceiued: yet (sayth God by the Prophet) when you goe, I wil see you by my prouidence, and spread a net for you by my wisdom, and drawe you downe by my power, and chastice you by my iustice, and make good the truth of that which you haue heard affir|med in your congregations.</P>
<P>They are all hotte as an ouen. Which is a borrowed <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ouen.</NOTE> speech, implying their sin bred at home. There is a fire <HI>wherewith Christ baptizeth, Matth.</HI> 3. and wherewithall, <HI>the Apostles were inriched, Acts</HI> 2. (I meane the vertue of Gods holy spirit) which when it takes possession of a man, <HI>it makes his heart hot within him</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Psal. 39. 4</NOTE>, <HI>and while he is mu|sing the fire kindleth, and he speakes with his tongue.</HI> But his words are like the words of <HI>Nepthali</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Gen. 49</NOTE>, <HI>Who is like a Hinde giuing good words:</HI> they are eyther prayses vnto his God, or charitable comforts vnto his brethren, or holy medita|tions vnto himselfe. Yet the same diuel that had <HI>a floud of water to send out of his mouth to drowne the Church and her children, Reuel.</HI> 12. hath water also to quench this holy fire, and in stead thereof hee hurls balls of wilde-fire into our soules, hee fanneth them with the blandishments of the world, that the sooner <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Iam. 1. 15</NOTE> <HI>Lust might conceiue &amp; bring forth sinne, that sinne when it is finished might bring forth death.</HI> Such is the forme of an ouen, that by reason of the vault
<PB N="4" REF="5">
and damming vp therof, the inward parts therof are black and vnclean, and the fire worketh more vehemently then in ordinary places: so it is with sinne.</P>
<P>It takes possession of the heart (the strongest holde) <NOTE PLACE="marg">Vncleaut.</NOTE> which is the throne of the minde, and by degrees surpri|seth the other parts of the body: <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Psal. 14. 5.</NOTE> <HI>The tongue by dropping the poyson of aspes vnder it: the hand by making them the hands of iniquitie: the feete by making them swift to shed bloud: the eyes by making them swell with lust: the wayes by making them exorbitant from the wayes of peace:</HI> So that when God seeth the garment of righteousnesse, which he hath besto|wed, rent and torne, the work of sanctification out of reparations, and his owne image canceld, he may say as his sonne our Sauiour did once say of the Romane coyne, <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Mar. 12. 87</NOTE> <HI>Whose image and superscription is this? It is</HI> Caesars: <HI>then giue vnto</HI> Caesar, <HI>that which is</HI> Caesars, <HI>and vnto God, that which is Gods.</HI> Whose image and superscription is this? It is the diuels, or the worlds, or the fleshes; then giue vnto them that which is theirs: they are not stam|ped with my seale, I acknowledge them not to bee mine owne.</P>
<P>When <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Plut. &amp; Su|ct.</NOTE> <HI>Caesar</HI> was wounded vnto death by the Senators of Rome, it grieued him much, but much more when hee perceiued himselfe to bee hurt by <HI>Brutus,</HI> whome he loued aboue the rest: therefore his dolefull tongue co|pied out of a more dolefull mind these words, <HI>Et tu fili?</HI> And thou my sonne also? So no doubt but it grieues God to bee pierced through with the sinnes of Atheists, and irreligious men: but it grieues mee more (may God say) when thou that art my childe rebelst against mee: thou whome as mine owne sonne I haue created, vvhome I haue redeemed, whome I haue iustified, whome I haue sanctified, whome I meane to glorifie: For, <HI>where the more debt is forgiuen, there the most loue and obedience is due,</HI> sayth Christ to <HI>Simon,</HI> Luke, 7. The world is olde and very sickly: and one (wee see) is distempered with a consumption of enuy, an other with a hotte feuer of ma|lice,
<PB N="5" REF="5">
another with lunaticke and rauing fittes of swea|ring, an other with a tympany or swelling of ambition, an other so loseth himselfe by drunkennesse, that a man may seeke a man in a man and not finde him. Yet, if you in this sinne-sicke world, can auoide the tinc|tures and staynings of concupiscence, and make wrack neyther vpon the Rockes, nor vpon the Sandes, ney|ther vppon open nor secret sinnes, <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Psal. 91. 5</NOTE> then <HI>neyther the arrowe that flyes by day, nor the Pestilence that walketh in the darkenesse, nor any euil that destroyeth at the noone day, shall do you any harme.</HI></P>
<P>I exhort you therefore vnto that warmth of the holy Spirit, which softned the hearts of the <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Luke, 24. 32</NOTE> <HI>two Disciples as they went vnto Emmaus,</HI> or if you wil to that higher degree of zeale <HI>for God and Gods house</HI> <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Iohn 2. 17. Psal. 69. 19.</NOTE> <HI>that eate vp</HI> DAVID. So may your Soules (Salamander-like) liue by <HI>that spirit of burning which purged the bloud of Ierusalem. E|say,</HI> chapter 4. So being free from staynings and black|nesse by that smoake of that other fire, you may bee cleane, and fit to stand before the Lord your God. Say therefore vnto concupiscence I will not nurse thee vp: harbour not that smooth faced enemie which vvill not only pollute (which first I noted) but it will make your owne affections rebells and mutinous within you, it will worke violently.</P>
<P>Witnesse the three effects of this home-borne sinne. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Violent.</NOTE> First. Their Iudges were deuoured. Secondly, Their Kings were fallen. Thirdly, They did not call on God. Behold how they were infatuate: in all their difficulties whither were they to flie? To their Iudges: yea but their Iudges were deuoured. Their Iudges being gone, whither then? to their Kings: yea but their Kings were fallen. Their Kings being fallen, whither then? to God; there was their highest Court of appeale: yea, but they called not vpon mee (sayth God). Loe here, with their owne hands they haue pulled downe all the sanctuaries they had, and 1. their Iudges.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="6">
Iudges and iudgement <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Ex. 18. 21</NOTE> (to auoid confusion) are bles|sings giuen vnto kingdomes by God, who is the God of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iudges.</NOTE> order and not of confusion.

Ma|chiuel,</HI> who for his villanie is exempt from comparison, though hee haue long since spawned in the world, and dipped in his opinions much of Christendome, sets down a rule, how a Conquerour may weaken a subdued king|dome, vnioint the sinewes thereof, and make them fall by their owne weight, that is <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">See Simon Patrichs an|swere to Mach. part. 3. maxim. 5.</NOTE>; by taking from them order and gouernment, by laying the reanes on their owne neckes, and allowing them to liue lawlesse. But lift you vp your voices in prayse and thankesgiuing <HI>among such as keepe holy day,</HI> because you liue in a kingdome, where <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 15. 41</NOTE> <HI>one starre differeth from another in glory,</HI> where the Iudges in their seuerall ranks, haue their mouthes as oracles, &amp; their bosomes as treasuries of good counsaile: who when they see <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Hos. 4. 2</NOTE> <HI>bloud swelling to touch bloud,</HI> they giue it <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Iob. 38. 10</NOTE> <HI>barres and doores: saying, Hitherto shalt thou come, and thou shalt come no further, here shalt thou stay thy proud waues.</HI> They are <HI>vines, and oliues and figge trees, Iudg. 9. They leaue their fatnesse, and their sweetnesse, and their wine, to raigne ouer the trees of the forrest,</HI> both ease &amp; pleasure for the good of Gods people. Prize at no lowe rate these iewells in your own ground, let not your sinnes serue as brokers to embeazle these co~|modities, and conuay them from you; but rather by good meditations and indeauours, husband your <HI>graines of mu|stard seed,</HI> that from the lesse you may grow to more grace, and become so louely in the sight of God, that your case may neuer be as <HI>Ephraims</HI> was, who for their sinnes had their Iudges deuoured, and <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Zecha. 11. 10</NOTE> the staffe of beauty (that is, comely gouernment) broken among them.

lance the impostumes, and prune the luxury of this king|dome, weigh well your high standing, looke vpward, and downward: vpward, &amp; consider that <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Psal. 81. 6.</NOTE> <HI>you are Gods;</HI> down|ward, and consider also that <HI>you shall die like men.</HI> There be two sins, whose forges, and anuils are neuer cold, but like Pyoners they are euer vndermining your seats of iustice: they are bribery and partialitie brethren in euill, <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Gen. 49. 6.</NOTE> <HI>into their secrets let not my soule descend.</HI></P>
<P>Bribery is marked in the forehead for a sinne, and ther|fore <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bribery.</NOTE> dares not approach neere your seates of iustice: but I pray God it play not the vsurper, and take possession of some about you, by vnlawfull intrusion. If it be true which is commonly receiued in the world, then there haue been many belonging vnto men of great place, who haue deceit and nimblenesse of wit, and bribery, and other sinnes, like as many porters to bring them in <HI>Pretium sanguinis, the price of bloud.</HI> Yet haue they cryed like the siluer-smith in the Acts: <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Acts 19. 18</NOTE> <HI>The great goddesse</HI> Diana, <HI>great is</HI> Diana <HI>of the Ephesians:</HI> the great goddesse Iustice, great is shee: when their care was not for iustice, but for their owne gaine, by pretending iustice, as the siluer-smithes inte~ded their own thriuing by making images in <HI>Dianaes</HI> temple. These things I haue heard, but I hope for better things in you, and yours, else may the seruant breake the masters <HI>head with precious balmes,</HI> and make them (like <HI>Re|hoboam)</HI> <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">1.

<P>Now though Bribery dare not be seene in the place of Iustice, yet Partiality is not such a stranger to flesh and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Partiality.</NOTE> bloud: and the more acquaintance, the more danger.

<P>The reason Theologicall, or diuine, is drawen first from the weakenesse of man, secondly from the commaunde|ment <NOTE PLACE="marg">Theologi|call.</NOTE> of God.</P>

<P>Besides the weakenesse of man, there is the commaun|dement <NOTE PLACE="marg">The com|mandment of God.</NOTE> of God also inforcing; the tenor whereof is, that <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Leuit. 22. 9</NOTE> <HI>no ground should be sowen with two seedes, that no garment of linsie wolsie should be worn, that no ground should be plowed with an oxe and an asse together:</HI> all which were shadowes of two religions, whereof there ought not to be a mixture.
