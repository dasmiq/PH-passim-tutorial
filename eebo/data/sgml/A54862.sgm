<P>_THE Dean of <HI>Sarum</HI> superstructs the <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> Rights in <HI>Thesi,</HI> (to things of humane Establishment) upon the Foundation of the <HI>Regal,</HI> as upon a <HI>Rock</HI> which cannot fail them. And also the Rights of the Bishop of <HI>Sarum</HI> in Hypothesi, upon the only sure Foot which it can possibly stand upon. The <HI>Moral Necessity</HI> of distinguishing (with the Judi|cious Bishop <HI>Sanderson</HI>) between an <HI>Original,</HI> and <HI>Derivative</HI> Right: As also (with the famous Chief Justice <HI>Coke</HI>) between a <HI>Subordinate,</HI> and the Su|preme.

who assert a <HI>Church-man's</HI> Right, <HI>with an Exclusion of the King</HI>'s; and strive to take down the Stairs, to which they owe their own Advancement.

<HEAD>A VINDICATION OF THE King's Sovereign Rights, As in all Cathedral Churches, so especially in the Church both of Old and New <HI>Sarum,</HI> as asserted in the Dean of <HI>Sarum</HI>'s <HI>Narrative,</HI> drawn up and presented to the most Noble Lords Commissioners.</HEAD>
<P>_HAving laboured of Late under the Obloquy of Some, and the Ill-will of Others, and the impotent Re|vengefulness at least of One, for having delivered what I had found of the King's Sovereign Rights, and his Royal Exercises thereof, as well in <HI>All Causes, as over all Persons Ecclesiastical, All Bodys Corporate and Cathedrals,</HI> more particularly ap|plied
<PB N="2" REF="5">
unto His Majesty's Free Chappel and Church of <HI>Sarum;</HI> tho' I did nothing of my self as a <HI>Vo|luntier,</HI> but by <HI>Commission</HI> and <HI>Command</HI> from the most Noble and the most Honourable the Lords Commissioners, appointed by his Gracious Majesty for Ecclesiastical Promotions, (whom God knows I did believe it my bounden Duty to obey;) I am induced to give the Reasons of my having made so bold with my <HI>Master</HI>'s Enemies and mine own, as to be dutifully Loyal without their Leave. I was loth to ask of them, by whom I was sure to be denied; And&punc; did Presume I might as pardon|ably assert the King's and the Churches Rights, now that the King is on His Throne, and the Church less Militant, as I did safely and with Suc|cess, before the Great Year of their Restauration.</P>
<P><HI>Sect.</HI> 1. <HI>First</HI> I was of an Opinion (before I had it from a most excellent and most Noble Lord Commissioner) <HI>That 'tis the Duty of every Subject, and especially of the King's Chaplains, to discover all they know of His Majesties Prerogative, tho' not Com|manded by Authority, as I had been.</HI> Which saying of a Judicious and a most Honourable Lord (in the Council Chamber, and elsewhere,) is agreea|ble to another of two Lord Chancellors in their times, whereof the first was the Lord <HI>Bacon;</HI> from whom 'twas borrowed by the Second, who used it in his Speech to Sir <HI>Edward Thurland</HI> when made a Baron of the Exchequer. To wit, <HI>That the Subjects of</HI> England <HI>in General, as well as the Iudges in particular,</HI> (and particularly the Judges of <HI>Ecclesiastical Courts,</HI> such as is the Dean of <HI>Sa|rum,</HI>) <HI>are bound to maintain the Prerogative, and not distinguish it from the Law. The King's Prerogative being Law, and</HI> (in the words of Chief Justice
<PB N="3" REF="5">
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Coke Instit. Part. 1. Sect. 648 P. 344.</NOTE> <HI>Coke,</HI>) <HI>The Principal part of the Common Law; as That from which all other Laws are derived, and on which they do depend.</HI> With these I compared that famous Saying of a full Parliament, which I found cited by my Lord <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Inst. Part. 4. c&punc; 1. p. 44.</NOTE> <HI>Coke</HI> too, <HI>That no King or Kingdom can be safe, but where the King has Three Abilities,</HI> 1. <HI>To live of his own, and defend his King|dom;</HI> 2. <HI>To assist his Confederates, and</HI> 3&punc; <HI>To reward his deserving Subjects.</HI> From whence I thought it would follow, that to take from the great Number of Ecclesiastical Promotions in the Kings Gift, is to act against the safety of King and Kingdom, 'Tis reckoned one of those things which even a <HI>King</HI> cannot do Lawfully, and which a <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rot. Parl. 42. Ed. 3. n. 7. ibid p. 14.</NOTE> <HI>Parliament</HI> cannot consent to. Besides I thought it most unworthy, that he who had not been afraid in the worst of Times, and without a Warrant, and under none but God's Protection, to defend the King's Rights and the whole Church of <HI>England,</HI> by many Arguments in Print, (when some <HI>New Royalists</HI> durst not join in a <HI>Petition</HI> for the Kings wished Return, <HI>for fear</HI> (as they then said) <HI>of setting their Hands to their own Ruine,</HI> as having reason to suspect the Restauration would be General, that All <HI>Usurpers</HI> must be <HI>Ejected,</HI> and all <HI>Ejected</HI> for their <HI>Loyalty,</HI> would have <HI>their own,</HI> which passed with some for <HI>an heavy Iudgement,</HI>) should now descend unto the <HI>Meanness</HI> of <HI>hiding</HI> himself behind <HI>Another,</HI> and behind <HI>such</HI> another as he knew to be <HI>Unqualified</HI> for such service, as I was irrationally suspected and most maliciously reported to have engaged <HI>Another in.</HI> No, the <HI>Pretenders</HI> to that Suspicion, and the <HI>Inventers</HI> of

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>WHereas 'twas affirmed by the Bishop of <HI>Sarum</HI> to the Lords, <HI>That there never was a Time when either the Dean and Canons were exempt from all Iurisdiction of the Bishop of</HI> Sarum. The contrary to it is <HI>confessed</HI> and <HI>strongly proved</HI> by his Lordship himself in the very next Words follow|ing, wherein his Lordship cites <HI>The Composition</HI> that was made between Bishop <HI>Waltham,</HI> Dean <HI>Mon|tacute,</HI> and the Then <HI>Chapter</HI> of the said Church, which was no longer since than in the Year 1391. whereas the <HI>Absolute Exemption</HI> of the Dean and All the Canons from the Bishops Jurisdiction, was in the Year 1095. Between which two Dates, there was an Interval of almost 300 Years.</P>
<P>Which <HI>Composition,</HI> so called, was indeed a <HI>Con|spiracy</HI> of the said <HI>Bishop, Dean</HI> and <HI>Chapter</HI> with <HI>Pope Boniface</HI> the <HI>Ninth,</HI> by whom it was con|firmed, and for which by the Laws of <HI>England</HI> (even (<HI>c</HI>) <HI>Then in force</HI>) they did incur a <HI>Praemu|nire:</HI> Which All the Bishops ever <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Judge <HI>Ienkins,</HI> p. 24. say, <HI>'Tis</HI> Treason <HI>to pay Obedience to the Pope, or to any other than to the King.</HI> For which he cites 23 Eliz. cap. 1. and 3 Jac. cap. 4. &sect;. 22, 23.</NOTE> since are humbly conceived to have incurred, who have presumed to Act according to <HI>That Conspiracy,</HI> I. Against the Supremacy, and Prerogative of the King; II. Against the Common, and Statute Law of the Land; III. Against the Fundamental Statute of our Subordinate Founder <HI>Osmund;</HI> IV. Against their own Souls in two respects, first in respect of the Several Oaths, which<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">25 Ed. 3. c. 22. 7 Rich. 2. c. 12.</NOTE>
<PB N="48" REF="28">
have severally been <HI>Sworn</HI> by all the Bishops, Deans and Chapters. That they would keep, and cause to be kept (as much as in them lay) that Fundamental Statute of <HI>Osmund,</HI> with all the Priviledges, Dignities, Immu|nities, and Exemptions therein contained; of which Oaths the said Conspiracy or Composition is a <HI>Professed</HI> Violation, as shall be shewn in its proper place. Secondly, in respect of the heavy Curse, which <HI>Osmund</HI> denounced against All those who should dare to pervert the said Fundamen|tal Constitutions in any kind. V. Against its own <HI>Being,</HI> by reason of its several <HI>Inconsistences</HI> with it self, and of the several Nullities contained in it. Lastly, Against the <HI>Well-being,</HI> if not against the very <HI>Being</HI> of the whole College within the Cathedral Church of <HI>Sarum,</HI> by reason of its most scandalous and most mischievous Effects. But of each in its Order.</P>
<P>&sect;. 1. First, It was a Conspiracy against the King of <HI>England</HI> and his Prerogative, who is in Law declared to be the <HI>Founder</HI> as well as <HI>Patron</HI> of all the Archibishopricks and Bishopricks in <HI>England,</HI> but took care in his Original Char|ter granted to his Favourite <HI>Osmund,</HI> (sealed first with the Seal of <HI>Will.</HI> I. and <HI>then</HI> with the Seal of <HI>Will.</HI> II.) to <HI>exempt</HI> his Dean and All his Prebendaries or Canons from the Bishops Juris|diction in as <HI>full</HI> and as <HI>plain</HI> a manner, as Latin words could express an <HI>Exemption</HI> by. In words so carefully contrived against all possible Affectation of Jurisdiction over the College of Dean and Chap|ter in any succeeding Bishop of <HI>Sarum</HI> that what the present Lord Bishop of <HI>Sarum</HI> would make an Argument for himself and his Affected Juris|diction,
<PB N="49" REF="28">
makes quite <HI>against</HI> him. For the <HI>Voice</HI> and the <HI>Place</HI> which the Bishop has in <HI>Chapter</HI> (common to him with all the 52 Canons) he has as <HI>Prebendary of Pottern,</HI> not as Bishop of <HI>Sarum;</HI> nor has he so much as a <HI>Second</HI> Voice as he is <HI>Prebendary of Blewbery,</HI> because he was never ad|mitted to it by Installation, nor lawfully could be. For when <HI>Hen.</HI> 2. <HI>had given two Prebends to One man in one Church,</HI> Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> the <HI>Third</HI> complained of it in his Letter, as Unlawful, and Uncanonical. (Not denying the <HI>King's Right</HI> of conferring Prebends, but the <HI>Evil use</HI> of it.) So that the Bishop in <HI>Capitulo</HI> has but one single Vote, and the liberty to propose what he thinks may tend to the good of the Church, or to com|plain of what he takes to be amiss, (as every other Prebendary has as free liberty to do,) and to be punished or amended by the Authority of Dean and Chapter. Nor is it said to be the <HI>Duty,</HI> but the <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Dignitas est Decani, &amp; omnium Can<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter">nicorum, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Dignity</HI> of the Dean and of all the Canons, <HI>ut Episcopo in nullo respondeant, nisi in Capitulo.</HI> To which 'tis added in the next words, (what his Lordship does not mention) &amp; <HI>judicio</HI> Tant&ugrave;m <HI>Capituli pareant,</HI> where the word <HI>Tantum</HI> excludes the Bishops <HI>Iudgment</HI> or definitive Sentence of any matter, &amp; limits it wholly to the Body of the Great Chapter (con|sisting of All the Canons Non-Resident and Re|sident) whereof the Dean is the Head, and the Prebendary of <HI>Pottern,</HI> a worthy Member; but the Bishop as Bishop is neither of them. Nor was this <HI>Signal Exemption</HI> only in the <HI>Foundation</HI> of the Cathedral, made at once by the <HI>Supreme</HI> and the <HI>Subordinate Founder;</HI> but it was <HI>Repeated</HI>
<PB N="50" REF="29">
and <HI>Confirmed</HI> by <HI>Hen.</HI> III. and Bishop <HI>Poor,</HI> in the Removal of the same from <HI>Old</HI> to <HI>New Sarum,</HI> in the years 1220. And the same <HI>Oaths</HI> for the due observance of it, have been ever since Sworn by all the Bishops, Deans, and Chapters without Exception. All which was alledged <HI>with effect</HI> in the Chapters <HI>Accusation</HI> of Bishop <HI>Erghum to</HI> Archbishop <HI>Sudbury</HI> (1375,) whom they charged before his Grace at once with <HI>Perjury</HI> and <HI>Usurpa|tion,</HI> for affecting a Jurisdiction over the Canons when the Dean was Dead, and the Deanry Va|cant, at a Time wherein the Bishop had a <HI>little colour for it,</HI> which might excuse his Sin <HI>a Tanto.</HI> Much more might they have done whilst the Dean was yet Living, if such an Incroachment had been attempted. Besides it was against the <HI>Imperial Crown of this Realm,</HI> by being against the Decanal Jurisdiction, which is <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Dignitas est Decani, &amp; omnium Can<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter">nicorum, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> <HI>for ever and inseparably thereto annexed,</HI> and granted unto the Dean under the Great Seal of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. II. Next it was against the <HI>Common</HI> and <HI>Statute Law</HI> of the Land. Against the first, be|cause the King's <HI>Prerogative is Law,</HI> and <HI>the Prin|cipal part of the Common Law,</HI> as that from which our Statute Laws are derived; and 'tis a Princi|ple with my Lord <HI>Coke,</HI> <Q><HI>The</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">1 Ed. 6. cap. 2. &sect;. 3. 1 Eliz. cap. 1. &sect;. 17, 18, &amp; 8 Eliz. cap. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Common Law disallows Acts done to the prejudice of any Subject of this Realm (much more of the Sovereign) by any Foreign Power out of the Realm, as things not Au|thentick.</HI></Q> Such was the Power of <HI>Boniface</HI> the <HI>Ninth</HI> meerly <HI>Foreign,</HI> and Prohibited <HI>as such</HI> by several Statutes then in force, and ever since.<NOTE PLACE="foot">(<HI>g</HI>) Cok<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter"> 1.

Against the second, because there were <HI>ab An|tiquo</HI> (before the Petition made to the Pope by the then Bishop, Dean and Chapter for the <HI>Papal Con|firmation</HI> of the Conspiracy aforesaid,) Acts of Parliament in force, against <HI>Appealing</HI> to, or <HI>Peti|tioning</HI> the Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> or any other <HI>foreign</HI> Power, either for <HI>Grants</HI> or <HI>Confirmations</HI> of any Acts, or <HI>Combinations,</HI> or <HI>Associations</HI> whatsoever, within these Realms; and therefore one <HI>Abbot Moris</HI> in the 46 of <HI>Ed.</HI> 3. incurr'd the Pain of <HI>Praemunire,</HI> for sending to <HI>Rome</HI> to <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><HI>27 Ed. 3.

a Right to confer, or a Power to hinder.

And although such an Act of <HI>Intercession to the Pope,</HI> as is pretended, had had an absolute <HI>Nullity</HI> in it self, had it been True; yet hardly any man can believe it, who shall consider the Statute made in the <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">16 R. 2. cap. 5.

But that the <HI>Trick</HI> I now mentioned was <HI>often</HI> used by the Popes, we cannot prove by a better Testimony than that of the most Learned and most sincere <HI>Padre Paul,</HI> who speaking of the Times of <HI>Paul</HI> the <HI>Fourth,</HI> in giving that to Queen <HI>Mary</HI> which was her <HI>own</HI> long before, and inherited from her Father, King <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. concludes with this signal Observa|tion: <HI>Cosi spesso i Papi hanno donato quello, che non hanno potuto levare a possessori; &amp; questi per suggire le contentioni, parte hanno ricevuto le Cose proprie in dono, &amp; parte hanno dissimulate di saper' il dono, &amp; la pretensione del Donatore.</HI> Add to all this, that the said Conspiracy was expresly against <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> by which the Deans and Chapters Liber|ties, Exemptions, and Jurisdictions, were confirm|ed

<P>&sect;. III. Thirdly, The foresaid Composition was even <HI>knowingly</HI> and <HI>professedly</HI> against <HI>The great Fundamental Statute</HI> (commonly called in our Books <HI>Magna Charta</HI> Osmundi,) <HI>of the Subordinate Founder Osmund,</HI> and by a Consequence unavoid|able against the <HI>Sovereign Founder</HI> also, whose Royal Seal alone was affixed to it.

But that 'twas <HI>knowingly</HI> and <HI>professedly</HI> against the same, is moreover to be proved from the Conclusion of the Conspiracy. For as there is a <HI>Contradiction</HI> to the Fundamental Statute and Charter both Legal and Episcopal, <HI>fol.</HI> 76. so in the next page of that Leaf there are these bold and unexcusable Words&mdash;<HI>Non obstante Statuto, &amp; Chartapraedicta,</HI> The King himself in Parliament could not have spoken in a more Imperial strain.

<PB N="59" REF="33">
the Bishop pretends to be the Deans Visitor; which is to take upon him a <HI>Regal,</HI> or <HI>Metropoliti|cal</HI> Authority, to <HI>which two alone</HI> the Dean of <HI>Sa|rum</HI> is <HI>subordinate</HI> in his <HI>Peculiars,</HI> as all others are who have Episcopal Jurisdiction within <HI>the Pro|vince;</HI> even abstracting from the Relation the Deans of <HI>Sarum</HI> ever had to the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Free Chap|pel,</HI> whereof the <HI>Privileges</HI> remain, and were ever reserved, though the <HI>Formality</HI> is obscured in a Great Cathedral Church. This last Absurdity spoken of, may be made to appear by these fol|lowing Degrees.</P>
<P><HI>N.</HI> I. First, There never was a Time since the <HI>Foundation</HI> of the Cathedral within the Kings Castle of Old <HI>Sarum,</HI> or since its <HI>Removal</HI> to the <HI>Close</HI> of <HI>New Sarum,</HI> (which <HI>Close</HI> must be distin|guished in all our Discourses from the City, which no body denies to be in the <HI>Bishops</HI> Jurisdiction, and in the <HI>Sub-Deans</HI> two Years in three,) where|in the Bishop <HI>was,</HI> or wherein the Dean of <HI>Sarum</HI> was <HI>not Immediatus Loci Ordinarius.</HI> Let them <HI>name</HI> it, and <HI>prove</HI> it, who were bold enough to say there was such a Time, as the Dean has na|med plainly, and also proved the Space of Time of almost 300 Years, between the Kings and <HI>Osmund</HI>'s Charter on one side, and the Infamous <HI>Composition</HI> on the other side, by which the Bishop hath pretended some Jurisdiction over the Close, five days in seven years, though none at all <HI>before</HI> or <HI>after</HI> so great a space as seven years: Which (by the way) is another Absurdity and Inconsistence. No Instance can be given of any <HI>Will proved</HI> within the Close by any Bishop, or any Letters of Administration granted, or any matter of Instance tryed, or any Fornication punished by any Bishop since the Foundation:
<PB N="60" REF="34">
but only by the Dean of <HI>Sarum,</HI> who is confessed|ly in the Statute of Bishop <HI>Roger</HI> himself (though an high-flying Bishop) <HI>Loci Ordinarius Immediatus.</HI> See the Statute <HI>De Testamentis Decano insinuandis.</HI> Now that is clearly <HI>an Immemorial Practice and Possession of the Dean which has been a Tempore, &amp; per Tempus, cujus contrarii memoria hominum non existit.</HI> Which Allegation to the Archbishop, for the Chapters <HI>Exemption</HI> from the Bishops Jurisdiction, Bishop <HI>Ralph Erghum</HI> could not deny, and thereupon was decreed against. 2. Next, the <HI>Decisions of Authority</HI> have been <HI>for</HI> the Dean, and <HI>against</HI> the Bishop, as often as Authority hath been appealed unto, which has been sel|dom.</P>
<P>1. In the Year 1301, when the then Bishop <HI>Simon de Gaunt</HI> endeavoured to invade the Deca|nal Jurisdiction over the Canons and other Mem|bers of the Cathedral Church of <HI>Sarum, Petrus de Sabaudia</HI> then Dean of <HI>Sarum,</HI> did by his In|strument in Writing, on the Third of <HI>October,</HI> Prohibit the Prebendaries or Canons, and all other Members of the said Church, and dis|charge them from submitting to the said Bishops Visitation.</P>
<P><HI>N.</HI> II. No longer since than in the Year 1665, <HI>Iohn Elliot, LL. Doctor,</HI> Chancellor then to Dr. <HI>Alexander Hyde</HI> Lord Bishop of <HI>Sarum,</HI> cited one <HI>Iohn Wickham,</HI> Servant to Mr. <HI>Chafin,</HI> living then in the Close of <HI>Sarum,</HI> unto the Bishops Con|sistory for Incontinency, &amp;c. <HI>Wickham</HI> not obey|ing the Summons, was by the said Chancellor <HI>de facto</HI> Excommunicated. Whereupon Mr. <HI>Richard Kent,</HI> then <HI>Prebendary</HI> of <HI>Sarum</HI> and <HI>Sur|rogate</HI> to the Reverend Dr. <HI>Richard Baily, Dean</HI> of <HI>Sarum,</HI> perceiving the Invasion committed
<PB N="61" REF="34">
upon the Dean's peculiar Jurisdiction, by Dr. <HI>Elliot</HI> the Bishops Chancellor, in citing <HI>Wickham</HI> within the Close, <HI>Absolves</HI> the said <HI>Wickham.</HI> Whereupon the Bishop makes his complaint to the Archbishop Dr. <HI>Gilbert Sheldon.</HI> The business came to an Hearing in St. <HI>Iohn</HI>'s <HI>College Gallery</HI> in <HI>Oxford,</HI> before the <HI>said Archbishop,</HI> and <HI>Edward</HI> Earl of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> Lord <HI>Chancellour of England;</HI> (the King then residing in <HI>Oxford.</HI>) And the Issue was this; That the Bishop should not intermeddle with any Ecclesiastical Censures, things, or Persons, out of his own Palace and Family; but that the whole decision of Ecclesiastical Matters within the said Close, did, and do purely, wholly and solely belong unto the Dean.</P>

<P><HI>N.</HI> III. Yea, since the present Lord Bishops, and the present Dean's Time, there was a Crime committed within his Lordships own Pallace, and by his Lordships chief Domestick; which being a Crime of Ecclesiastical cognizance, was by consequence to be punished by the King's Ec|clesiastical Laws. The Bishop applied himself first by Letters to the Dean and Chapter <HI>conjun|ctim,</HI> for the Punishing of the chief Party in
<PB N="62" REF="35">
that Commission; proposing the <HI>Composition</HI> to them, whereby his Lordship was in hopes a Correction <HI>de bene esse</HI> might be favourably inflicted. The Dean and Chapter met on purpose in Dr. <HI>Drake</HI>'s House, to Read and to consider of the said <HI>Com|position.</HI> Which having done, They unanimously agreed in this Judgment, (of which they sent his Lordship word,) That the whole <HI>Composition</HI> (sup|posing it to be valid,) was wholly impertinent to the Matter in hand: And that none but the Dean alone, as the <HI>Sole Ordinary of the Close,</HI> could Summon both Parties into his Consistory Court, and put the Law in Execution. The Dean how|ever made a delay, because the Principal Offender had committed the Fact in the <HI>Bishop's Palace,</HI> which he was willing to esteem a place <HI>Exempted</HI> from the Decanal Jurisdiction. And this he pleaded to the Lord Bishop, whom he desired to correct his own Domestick in his own Family, or in his own Court, which the Dean said, he would warrant his Lordship the doing of by Letters Dimissory, or License under the Seal of his De|canal Office. But his Lordship urged with great strength of Reason, as well as Earnestness; (1.) That such a Liberty in the Close, was more than either the Dean could give away lawfully, or the Bishop receive. (2.) That the Party cited into his Court might appeal to the Arches from the Bishop <HI>tanquam a non Iudice,</HI> and make the very <HI>Iudge</HI> of that Court a <HI>Criminal.</HI> (3.) That the Dean might Summon a Prebendary to ap|pear in his Court by a certain day from any part of the Kingdom; but (4.) That the Bishop could not cite him into His, however nearly an Inhabitant. Whereupon the Dean of <HI>Sarum,</HI> acknowledging the Bishop too hard for him in the Contest, was
<PB N="63" REF="35">
forced to own his Unavoidable Authority in the Close, <HI>as inseparably annexed to the Imperial Crown of these Realms,</HI> (which is the language of <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">See 25 Hen. 8. 20. &amp; 26 Hen. 8. 1. &amp; 1 Eliz. 1. &sect;. 17. n. I. &amp; &sect;. 18. n. 1. and other Statutes recited 8 Eliz. cap. 1.</NOTE> several Acts of Parliament,) and not without Trouble and Self denial, did satisfie the Law upon both the offending Parties.</P>
<P><HI>N.</HI> IV. Since which time also, no longer since than on the <HI>15th</HI> of <HI>September</HI> 1681. the present Dean was desired by Mr. Archdeacon <HI>Woodward,</HI> then the <HI>Bishop of</HI> Sarum's <HI>Surrogate,</HI> (Now <HI>the Chancellor of this whole Diocess,</HI>) to permit and allow the People of <HI>Broad-Chalk</HI> in <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> to ask the voluntary Benevolence of Persons living with|in the Close of <HI>Sarum.</HI> To whom the Dean gave his leave, or permission rather, in these words following: <HI>As far as the Laws of this Realm permit, and being earnestly requested, as well as moved with the Resentment of so many mens Losses within the Parish of</HI> Broad-Chalk, <HI>I do allow the said Sufferers to try the Charity of the Inhabitants within my Peculiar of the Close of New</HI> Sarum, <HI>though not in any other Place under the Decanal Iurisdiction of</HI></P>

</TEXT></Q>
<P>Now it is to be noted, that the Parish of <HI>Broad-Chalk,</HI> is under the Bishop's Jurisdiction; and that the Lord Bishop was then at home, in his Palace within the Close; and that his Leave had been sufficient without the Deans, had he had any Jurisdiction within the Close; much more had his Jurisdiction been <HI>Archiepiscopal,</HI> or <HI>Regal,</HI> and so Superior to the Deans. Lastly, That the
<PB N="64" REF="36">
Bishops <HI>Surrogate,</HI> knowing well that his Lordship had none at all within the Close, (though his Lordship and the Sub-Dean have all between them in the City,) did therefore make his Ap|plication, to the Dean, and the Dean only. In like manner the Collection which was made with|in the Close for the rebuilding of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Lon|don,</HI> the Redemption of Captives, and the like, was made and returned by the Dean only and his Officers, according to the King's Order and Direction.</P>
<P><HI>N.</HI> V. If we step as far back as to the Year of our Lord 1584. we shall find the great diffe|rence between a <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Sarum,</HI> who was <HI>first Dean</HI> of <HI>Sarum,</HI> and a Bishop who <HI>never was</HI> Dean of the same Church. For Dr. <HI>Iohn Pierce,</HI> whilst Dean of <HI>Sarum,</HI> did in conjunction with his Chap|ter, and by Command of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> (to whom he was <HI>Almoner</HI> many years,) upon the <HI>17th of October,</HI> 1573. <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Testante <HI>Blacker</HI> Notar. Publ. <HI>f. 89.</HI></NOTE> begin the good work of abolishing Superstitious and Popish Statutes, <HI>without</HI> the consent or the assistance of the then Bishop <HI>Edmund Ghuest.</HI> (Though he so swept the Church, as to leave some Dust behind the Door.) But being afterwards <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Sarum,</HI> (as after that, Archbishop of <HI>York,</HI>) he got a Commission from the <HI>Archbishop of the Province</HI> to visit the Church upon occasion of the Case of Dr. <HI>Zouch,</HI> and said, he was <HI>fultus Iurisdictione Metropolitana;</HI> knowing well, and confessing, that, <HI>as Bishop of Sarum,</HI> he had no right to Visit the <HI>Choral Vicars,</HI> much less the <HI>Chapter,</HI> much less the <HI>Dean;</HI> for if he had, he would not have needed any Com|mission
<PB N="65" REF="36">
from the Archbishop of the whole Pro|vince.</P>
<P><HI>N.</HI> VI. The said Exemption of <HI>All the Canons</HI> of the <HI>greater</HI> and <HI>lesser</HI> Chapter, who make a <HI>Su|periour</HI> Corporation whereof their Dean is the Head, may be yet farther proved by the Exemp|tion of <HI>All the Vicars,</HI> who are an <HI>Inferiour</HI> Cor|poration, from the Bishop of <HI>Sarum</HI>'s Power and Jurisdiction. For it appears by the Vicars Char|ter, which they enjoy from the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> (as the Dean and Chapter do Theirs,) that they are only subjected to the correction of Dean and Chapter, not at all to the Bishops, who can nei|ther <HI>put in, nor punish;</HI> much less, <HI>put out</HI> a Vicar, or a Lay Clerk, however criminal. And accor|dingly the Vicars, (as well as the Lay Clerks) take an Oath at their Admission of paying Obe|dience unto the <HI>Dean,</HI> and to the <HI>Dean only</HI> whilst he is present, and in the Dean's Absence to the Deans <HI>Locum-tenens,</HI> authorized under the Seal of the Decanal Office: But none at all to the <HI>Bishop,</HI> whether Present, or Absent; which was eminent|ly acknowledged by this present Bishop in his own Palace, when in the presence of the Dean and Chapter, and all the Vicars, his Lordship protested three several times to Mr. <HI>Hardwick,</HI> the Vicars Procurator, and Prolocutor, and to his Brethren then present, <HI>That if it were in his Power, he would expel them every one,</HI> for their then Recalcitration and Opposition, both to the Bishop and to the Chapter, when good Lawyers told the Vicars, they had the Law on their Side. The Vicars were not a little pleased at his Lordship's <HI>Brutum Fulmen,</HI> and confession of his <HI>No-Power</HI> over the Vicars within the Close, three times repeated. Nor could any but the Dean bring
<PB N="66" REF="37">
those Vicars to a Submission and full compliance, which he soon after did with the best effect.</P>
<P><HI>N.</HI> VII. Even since my coming to keep my Re|sidence at <HI>Sarum,</HI> the <HI>20th.</HI> of this instant <HI>Iune,</HI> I find two <HI>Notorious and Publick Confessions in effect, of</HI> the Lord Bishop of <HI>Sarum</HI> his having no Power to Visit <HI>within the Close,</HI> whether the Dean will or no, or without the Dean's <HI>Leave, Concurrence,</HI> and <HI>Consent,</HI> under the Seal of his Decanal Office, as well as under his own Hand; which being <HI>sought,</HI> but <HI>refused</HI> (very honestly and prudently) by the Dean's Surrogate <HI>in his absence,</HI> and <HI>without his knowledge;</HI> the Dean's <HI>Locum-tenens,</HI> for the Chapter, (as the Sub Dean Mr. <HI>Kent&punc;</HI> is the Dean's Surrogate for his Court and his peculiar Juris|diction, wherewith the Chapter hath nothing to do, nor any mortal Besides the King, and the Arch-Bishop of the Great Province,) did as ab|surdly, as unfaithfully, clap the Common Seal of the Dean and Chapter, (of the Dean chiefly as the Head, and of the Chapter as his Members,) by <HI>usurping my Name in it,</HI> and by counterfeiting my <HI>Will, against</HI> my Will, my Interest, my Juris|diction, <HI>without asking</HI> my Consent or Permission, without so much as saying, <HI>By your Leave Sir,</HI> yea studiously and in haste without my <HI>knowledge,</HI> even when He and the Rest knew I was but few Miles from them, and even then <HI>coming</HI> (tho' not yet come) to my House at <HI>Sarum.</HI> Being come, I soon found <HI>Two Citations</HI> in the Choir, made by a Fiction of my Name, and of my Name only, beginning Thus, Thomas Pierce <HI>Sancta Theol. Professor, Ecclesiae Cathedralis</HI> Sarum <HI>Decanus, &amp; ejus|dem Ecclesiae Capitulum, Universis &amp; Singulis,</HI> &amp;c. Finding This to be done 1. Without my know|ledge; and 2. With my very great Abhorrence;
<PB N="67" REF="37">
3. Against my Judgment; 4. Against my Right of Jurisdiction; 5. Against the King, of whom I hold my Jurisdiction under the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> (and unto <HI>whose Imperial Crown my Iuris|diction is annexed by 32 Acts of Parliament;</HI> 6. A|gainst <HI>my self in mine own name,</HI> and Poetically brought in upon the stage, <HI>Citing my self, and the Bishop,</HI> as the Prebendary of <HI>Blewbery,</HI> but not as Prebendary of <HI>Pottern,</HI> (which the Bishop is also) Comically personated whether I will or no, like a Puppet <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">St. fol. 44. b.</NOTE> moving by Wires; 7. Against Express Statute to the contrary; 8. Against the Oaths of the Members of the Chapter, who had an Hand in the usurpation (which I am sure but few had;) 9. Against the Trust reposed in my Depu|ty; and 10. Against the very License or Consti|tution, whereby I had enabled him in my Absence to call Chapters for the taking care of God's worship, the keeping of Statutes and Laudable Customs of the Church, as far as they agree with the Word of God, and with the Law of the Land, and for the Correction of the Canons and Members, but so limited, as I have said, not for the using the Common Seal at all, much less at his Pleasure, without my knowledge, and con|sent, and against my self; I say finding This, and a world of Absurdities (too many, and too great to be recounted in this Pinch of Time;) I inferred their <HI>Conviction of my sole Right,</HI> as Dean, to cite the 52 Prebendaries and all other members who had sworn obedience to me, from their conceiving themselves forced to run so great a Risque, as that of <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">D. <HI>D.</HI> Longland. Harwards Acts. pag. 61. 125.</NOTE> <HI>Crimen Falsarii,</HI>
<PB N="68" REF="38">
Rather than set up such a Citation <HI>without&punc; my Name,</HI> or in Any man's Name but Mine; and for their false using the <HI>Common Seal</HI> of <HI>Dean and Chapter,</HI> for want of the Decanal Peculiar Seal, which Alone had been Authentick. Therefore under my Seal of Office belonging to me, and me only, as an Ordinary, and Judge, of the King's Ecclesiastical Court within my Peculiar the Close of <HI>Sarum,</HI> and elsewhere, I made my <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dated</HI> Jun. 20. 1683.</NOTE> Prote|station against That usurpation of my name, de|claring it unlawful, Null, and Void, as shall be set forth at Large in the Second part of my De|fence, if Occasion shall serve, or Need require.</P>
<P>&sect;. 6.

<P><HI>N.</HI> I. First, The Statutes which have been made by Deans and Chapters without the Bishops, and others made by several Bishops with the Permis|sion
<PB N="69" REF="38">
or Consent of Deans and Chapters, being no way obliging beyond the Time of the Con|trivers, (nor even <HI>Then</HI> but by our Monarchs having no notice of them,) succeding <HI>Setts of Legislators,</HI> as good as Those who went before them, and as destitute of Authority to take up|on them a <HI>Legislation,</HI> made other Statutes at their Pleasure, as inconsistent with the former as Light with <HI>Darkness.</HI> Insomuch that they who <HI>swear</HI> to <HI>keep</HI> the Statutes, as they are now, (without any distinction of Good or Evil, Valid or Invalid, Loyal or Disloyal, Protestant or Popish, made by Sovereigns or by Subjects without Commission, Obsolete or in use,) do take an Oath they will be perjured, so far forth as they are not saved by a <HI>Quatenus conveniunt cum verbo Dei &amp; cum Statutis hujus Regni;</HI> which is a <HI>necessary</HI> help, but <HI>not suffi|cient,</HI> because there is not added to it another <HI>Quatenus</HI> or <HI>Qousque conveniunt Statut<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter"> inter se, &amp; sibi invicem non repugnant.</HI> For standing All as they do, partly <HI>lawful</HI> but <HI>laid aside,</HI> partly <HI>unlawful</HI> but yet <HI>observed</HI> and <HI>in use,</HI> and flatly repugnant to one another, (as shall be demonstrated by and by) it plainly follow's that for a man of the Church of <HI>Sarum</HI> to <HI>keep one Statute,</HI> is <HI>ipso facto</HI> to <HI>break and violate another.</HI></P>
<P><HI>N.</HI> II. Before I come to prove This, by de|scending to some Particulars, I think it useful to premise this General Observation, to wit, that the Statutes which are Authentick, both by Law, and in themselves, as having been made by our Founders, the <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Osmund,</HI> and by our Later <HI>Monarchs</HI> of <HI>England, Hen. 8. Ed.</HI> 6. and Q. <HI>Eliz.</HI> which alone are obliging both to the Bishop, Dean and Chapter, are of All other Statutes the <HI>most neglected and out of Use,</HI> (to say no more
<PB N="70" REF="39">
at this time) whilst the Statutes of several <HI>Popes,</HI> and of several Popish Bishops and Deans and Chapters of <HI>Sarum,</HI> however selfish and presump|tuous, against the Law of the Land, and the Canons of the Church, and very oppressive to Posterity, and therefore fit to have perished with Those that made them, have been hitherto <HI>ob|served</HI> (to the hazarding of Souls) with too much strictness.</P>
<P><HI>N.</HI> III. Now to demonstrate the Contradictions, and other Mischievous effects, which have been principally caused by the Infamous <HI>Composition</HI> of the said <HI>Boniface</HI> the Ninth, with the then Bishop, Dean and Chapter (Birds of a Feather every one at that Time, during the loose and weak Reign of the most careless <HI>Rich.</HI> 2. of whom Historians give This Character, That of All Coun|sellors and Councils he did constantly take the Worst,) I cannot better begin than with the Words of Bishop <HI>Henchman,</HI> once the <HI>Chantor,</HI> and a <HI>Residentiary,</HI> and after Bishop of <HI>Sarum,</HI> and at last Bishop of <HI>London;</HI> when being con|sulted by Dean <HI>Brideoak</HI> about the compelling of certain Prebendaries at large to confirm their Leases by the Common Seal of Dean and Chap|ter, and also to pay the <HI>Fifth part</HI> of their Prebends for their Non-residence Thirteen Weeks in the Year, according to <HI>Osmund</HI>'s Constitution, and the Statute of Bishop <HI>Iewel</HI> with the concurrence and combination of the then Dean and Chapter, sent his <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">From <HI>London</HI> House, <HI>May 7. 1668.</HI></NOTE> Answer in these Words following. <Q>You must also understand, that the <HI>great Vicissi|tudes and Changes</HI> which <HI>Those</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>H. 8.

themselves unto, <HI>did require Rules and Statutes, fitted to the disturbed Condition of Church Affairs Then.</HI> And you may observe in your Books, that <HI>Continual Controversies</HI> did arise, partly because they did <HI>injoyn</HI> Things <HI>Contrary</HI> to each other, and partly because they were adapted to <HI>Those Times only,</HI> and <HI>were not practi|cable in after times.</HI> I will give an Instance. Do you think that now a Prebendary <HI>not admit|ted into Residence</HI> may be <HI>mulcted</HI> at <HI>Quinta parte Praebendae,</HI> because <HI>he doth not Reside in the Close of</HI> Salisbury <HI>Thirteen Weeks in every Year?</HI> Yet this is the Statute of Bishop <HI>Iewel.</HI> Roga|tu <HI>Fratrum nostrorum cum consensu Capituli</HI> (the Dean was absent) <HI>statuimus veterem Antecessoris nostri</HI> Osmundi <HI>Constitutionem, quam de ea retulit, in integrum esse restituendam; hoc est Canonicos hujus</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Subaudi Residenti&acirc;.</NOTE> <HI>Ecclesiae nostrae</HI> Omnes <HI>&amp;</HI> Singulos, <HI>nisi juxta formam Veterum Statutorum,</HI> adsint <HI>&amp;</HI> re|sideant, Quinta parte Praebendae suae mulctan|dos esse; <HI>Pecuniam autem omnem ita collectam ad Fabricam Ecclesiae nostrae Cathedralis conferri volumus.</HI> What think you? Can a Prebendary <HI>not Residentiary</HI> be <HI>compelled</HI> now so to <HI>Reside?</HI> Indeed he that lives upon his own Land, or Farm, and not in his Parsonage with Cure; nor where his Residence is by Law allowed, is a great Offender. But if an Archdeacon or Prebendary take upon him to Reside in <HI>Sarum</HI> (<HI>being no Residentiary</HI>) he is liable to a Sore Mulct upon an Information in the <HI>Exche|quer.</HI> Will you admit every one into Resi|dence that shall offer himself, and <HI>protest de Re|sidendo?</HI> You will soon be weary of that. Or
<PB N="72" REF="40">
will you <HI>tax a man</HI> at <HI>Quinta parte Prebendae,</HI> be|cause <HI>he doth not Reside,</HI> and yet you will <HI>not ad|mit him to Reside?</HI></Q> Thus far Bishop <HI>Henchman</HI> exposed those Statutes to ridicule, by which All the Canons (in number 52) are <HI>obliged</HI> to Resi|dence, yet <HI>not allowed</HI> to Reside; Have a <HI>Right</HI> to be Residents, yet <HI>no permission</HI> to enjoy it. 'Tis their <HI>Duty</HI> and their Crime, to Reside in the Close and the Cathedral Thirteen weeks every Year. They <HI>must,</HI> and yet they <HI>may not</HI> perform the Will of the Founder, confessed by Bishop <HI>Iewel</HI> to be expresly the <HI>Subordinate</HI> Founder's Will, and by consequence <HI>the Will</HI> of the <HI>Sovereign</HI> Founders, <HI>Will.</HI> 1. and <HI>Will.</HI> 2. whose Seals were set to <HI>Osmund</HI>'s Charter. Men are <HI>punishable</HI> for That, for which they ought to be <HI>rewarded.</HI> Not <HI>permitted</HI> to keep a Residence, to which by Statute they are <HI>compelled,</HI> and <HI>compelled</HI> to pay money for <HI>Not doing</HI> That which they <HI>must not do.</HI> The <HI>work</HI> is incumbent on 52 Canons or Preben|daries; but Six of their Number ingross the <HI>Wa|ges</HI> unto themselves. This Absurdity is so great, that hardly any can be greater, unless it be That which follows. For</P>
<P><HI>N.</HI> IV. In flat contradiction to the Fundamen|tal Statute, and Oath of <HI>Residence,</HI> and to the late repeated Statute of <HI>Bishop Iewel</HI> with the <HI>then Chapter,</HI> the present Bishop and the then Chapter made a New Statute (<HI>Octob.</HI> 3. 1672, Sethi <HI>Anno sexto</HI>) to this effect, That if they who have taken the Oath of continual Residence, keep not so much as <HI>Three Months Residence,</HI> they shall pay Five Pounds for each Months <HI>Non-Resi|dence,</HI> or 15 <HI>l.</HI> for the <HI>Non-Residence</HI> of the <HI>Year:</HI> so that for 15 <HI>l. per annum</HI> they may be <HI>Residents</HI> good enough <HI>without Residing,</HI> and save 100 <HI>l. per</HI>
<PB N="73" REF="40">
<HI>annum</HI> (which any mans Residence will cost him,) by paying only Fifteen Pounds. So as the Resi|dentiaries are <HI>tempted,</HI> (not to keep, but) to <HI>vio|late</HI> their <HI>Oath of Residence,</HI> (if such a Titulary Statute can have any force in it,) by <HI>Compounding</HI> or <HI>Commuting for breach of Oath,</HI> the Price of which Sin is but Fifteen Pounds. I do not know if Men are <HI>Taxed</HI> for the Sins by them commit|ted at so favourable a Rate in the Court of <HI>Rome.</HI> Now considering, that the Residents were shrunk and reduced long before, from 52 or 53, (for the Prebendary of <HI>Pottern</HI> was <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Per Stat. Decani <HI>Richardi</HI> &amp; Capituli, &agrave; <HI>Rogero</HI> de <HI>Morti|val</HI> Episcopo confirmati. 1214.</NOTE> bound to Re|sidence at first,) to the Dean and 12, and after that to the Dean and 6, and now at last by this last Statute (so called) to <HI>None at all,</HI> if each of the Residents will redeem himself from that Du|ty, or buy out his Residence for the said Sum of <HI>15l.</HI> (as some have done, and all may do,) here seems to be a way made to the very <HI>Dissolution of the whole College,</HI> if not in Time of the whole <HI>Ca|thedral Church</HI> of <HI>Sarum,</HI> notwithstanding his Majesties Ecclesiastical Laws, which do oblige unto the Residence of 90 Days, or 3 Months. And all Local Statutes have a <HI>Nullity</HI> in the mak|ing, which are repugnant to the <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Mod&ograve; Verbo Dei, aut <HI>Praerogativae Regiae non repugnent,</HI> Can. 42.</NOTE> Prerogative of the King, to the Law of the Land, or the Word of God.</P>
<P><HI>N.</HI> V. Another Statute has been made since his Majesties Restauration, enjoyning Prebendaries to bring their Leases to be <HI>Confirmed</HI> by the Com|mon Seal of the Dean and Chapter, to which they cannot be compelled, unless by the King,
<PB N="74" REF="41">
or an Act of Parliament. Of whieh the afore|said Bishop <HI>Henchman</HI> in his Letter to the said Dean, did write these words&mdash;[And I must add, That since <HI>Prebendaries</HI> and their Tenants have understood, that Leases Demised by Sole Corporations (according to the Statutes of the Realm) receive no strength by Capitular Confirmation, you shall do well to <HI>perswade</HI> and <HI>invite</HI> the Members of your Church to observe the good Rules lately made concerning Leases; but be not hasty to <HI>compel</HI> by Censures or Penalties, &amp;c.&mdash;<HI>A little after, touching the Statute en|joyning Prebendal Contributions, by way of Tax towards the Repairing of the Church, the Reverend Bishop adds thus,</HI>&mdash;Take the best and surest course you can to have the Help of the <HI>Prebenda|ries;</HI> but take heed you adventure not to compel them, lest you meet with Consequences which may to a good degree frustrate a Work of so high Importance.]</P>
<P><HI>N.</HI> VI. All the Oaths which have been <HI>Admini|stred,</HI> much more those which have been <HI>imposed,</HI> by Bishop, Dean and Chapter upon <HI>Prebendaries</HI> or <HI>Vicars,</HI> in any Matter not belonging to their Spiritual Jurisdictions, or not in a way of Ad|ministring Justice, have been <HI>against Law,</HI> and <HI>the King's Prerogative.</HI> The power to give and impose Oaths being so peculiar to the Prerog|ative Royal, that 'tis punishable to do it, <HI>without,</HI> or <HI>beyond</HI> the bounds of the King's Commission, by way of Indictment or Information, as an high Misdemeanor: Nor can any Custom legitimate such an invented Oath, unless it had a <HI>Lawful</HI> and <HI>just</HI> beginning. The House of Commons are so sensible of the want of this Power, not only to <HI>impose,</HI> but <HI>administer</HI> Oaths to Witnesses, (who, being <HI>voluntary,</HI> are as ready to Swear, as to appear,) that they often accept of Evidence
<PB N="75" REF="41">
upon bare Averments. Nor can the Voluntary <HI>Submission</HI> of the Prebendaries or Vicars create unlawful Power in the Bishop, Dean and Chapter conjoyned, which otherwise by Law they have not, either to <HI>impose</HI> or to <HI>administer</HI> an Oath, nor excuse them in so doing. For however such Oaths so administred and taken, not to lett a Lease upon such or such Terms as the Law allows, (as for Example for Three Lives without Li|cense,) do bind the Takers of them in <HI>Conscience,</HI> yet <HI>in Law</HI> they are illegal, null, and void. And so 'twas declared by the late Lord Chancellor upon occasion of a Suit in that Court depending.</P>
<P><HI>N.</HI> VII. By a Statute or a Decree of the Bishop, Dean and Chapter of <HI>Sarum,</HI> made in <HI>October</HI> 1671. no Lease is to be Lett by any Prebenda|ry (however he is singly a Corporation,) <HI>without three Conditions,</HI> (by Law allowed, but prohibited by them,) and <HI>all Three under the pain of Excom|munication;</HI> which yet ('tis well known) cannot lawfully be inflicted for any matter or crime which is not made to be <HI>so punishable</HI> by some Statute of the Land: Nor can any thing less than the King or Parliament <HI>de novo</HI> create, or make a thing criminal. And though the breach of such Conditions in the letting of a Lease (which Conditions are wholsom) be supposed to be a Crime in such as have consented to them, yet the <HI>Matter being Temporal</HI> it is not punishable in Law by an <HI>Excommunication.</HI> Yet this is ano|ther of the sore Mischiefs, whereof the aforesaid <HI>Composition</HI> hath been the Occasion of the Cause.</P>
<P><HI>N.</HI> VIII. But there are other effects of it, where|by <HI>Simony</HI> seems plainly not only to be <HI>allowed,</HI> but even <HI>established</HI> by a <HI>Law,</HI> (such as a Bishop
<PB N="76" REF="42">
and the Chapter can make <HI>de facto</HI> by the afore|said <HI>Composition,</HI> which owes its chief force to Pope <HI>Boniface</HI> the <HI>Ninth;</HI>) whilst men are made to pay dearly for their Places of Preferment, which by the King are freely granted. For no sooner have the Residents in the Church of <HI>Sarum</HI> taken their Oaths, That they neither have given, nor will give any Sum or Sums for those Places unto which they are admitted; but presently, by the <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">De Finibus Canonicorum ad Residentiam Receptorum. <HI>St. fol. 58, 59.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Statute</HI> of Pope <HI>Eugenius</HI> the <HI>Fourth,</HI> even af|ter he was deposed by the Council of <HI>Basil</HI> (when for Money he would do any thing,) there is (besides all other payments by way of customary Fees) a great Fine for <HI>Entrance, Finis pro Introitu,</HI> to be paid in ready Money, or well secured by Obligation. And though at first no more was paid than <HI>Forty shillings</HI> to the Fabrick, (<HI>A. D.</HI> 1319.) yet by the Statute of <HI>Dean Sydenham,</HI> and his then Chapter, (1428.) Authorized at <HI>Florence</HI> by the said Titular Pope, (1442.) each Resident <HI>with</HI> Dignity is to pay for his Entrance 105 <HI>l.</HI> and each <HI>without</HI> Dignity is to pay for the same <HI>71 l. 13s. 4d.</HI> (besides a greater Sum required by a much younger Statute, of which hereafter.) This <HI>Statute</HI> is bad enough; but the <HI>Custom</HI> is worse: For besides that the Fines for Entrance are <HI>diverted</HI> from the <HI>Fabrick,</HI> and <HI>divided</HI> among the <HI>Residents</HI> of the <HI>Chapter;</HI> the <HI>Custom</HI> hath violated the Statute, in exacting no more from men <HI>with</HI> Dignity, than <HI>without</HI> it; so that the latter pay <HI>too much</HI> (though less than the Statute does require,) and the former <HI>too little,</HI> because much less than is due by Statute, which yet they
<PB N="77" REF="42">
pretend (and that with Contention) to be in force. Only the Dean of all four Dignities must be excepted, who pay by Custom to the heighth of what the Statute does enjoyn, and by Custom much more. Nor is this all: For Tyrant Cu|stom which keeps up that Statute, does beat it down at the same time in five remarkable degrees, for which no Creature was ever yet able to give a Reason. Yet these are Customs and Statutes, which they who take to be Obliging do Swear to keep. But as if this were not enough, for a Learned poor man to be beggared by in his Ad|vancement, (as how many the most deserving have the least Portion of Mony, and none to spare, and often dye without Re-imbursement?) there was another Statute made by a <HI>Bishop, Dean</HI> and <HI>Chapter,</HI> as well without the <HI>King's</HI> as the <HI>Pope's</HI> concurrence, and without the concurrence of <HI>Common</HI> Sense: For by force of that Statute (another effect of the <HI>Composition</HI>) every Resident who is living, must fast a Year from all Commons; and every Resident when he is dead, must eat a Years Commons in his Grave. At least in <HI>Ari|stotle</HI>'s sense, <GAP DESC="foreign"> for what he does by his Executor, he interpre|tatively does; and accordingly 'tis said (with as much Pithiness, as Impropriety,) to be the Dead Resident his <HI>Annus post Mortem;</HI> that is, his <HI>U|nius anni proficua undecunque Provenientia.</HI> 'Twas not the Christian Self-denial of those Usurping Legislators, who first invented this Law in their own behalf. A Law resented very deeply by some Publick-spirited Bishops of other Churches, who have expressed their Resentments to the now Dean of <HI>Sarum,</HI> with a great deal of holy
<PB N="78" REF="43">
Indignation; and heartily <HI>wished</HI> for a Remedy of this and other Impositions.</P>
<P><HI>N.</HI> IX. But hardly can a Remedy be brought about, but by the long and mighty Arm of Sa|cred Majesty, which in a Royal Visitation can abolish Old Statutes, and make us New Ones; Statutes suitable to our <HI>Religion,</HI> by Law estab|lished. Statutes not repugnant to the King's <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Prerogative.</HI> Statutes agreeable with themselves, and to be sworn to the <HI>safety</HI> of all mens <HI>Consciences</HI> and <HI>Souls.</HI> Lastly, Statutes not expiring with the Breath of them that make them, like those Royal Statutes which were made heretofore for the Church of <HI>Sarum:</HI> For those of <HI>Edw.</HI> 6. and Q. <HI>Elizab.</HI> were never yet so much as <HI>entred</HI> into the Statute Book; insomuch that the former and present Dean could never get a sight of them. And those of King <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. by one of his Masters of Requests, Sir <HI>Iohn Tregon|well,</HI> (Commissioned under the Great Seal of <HI>En|gland,</HI>) were only enter'd like an Old Almanack, and stand as a Monument of Contempt, which for many years past have been put upon them; no more regarded than the <HI>Great Charter</HI> both of the Sovereign and Subordinate Founders. Not|withstanding our Monarchs are declared by Acts of Parliament to have all such <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">This is a short account of the Statute at large 1 <HI>Eliz. cap. 1. &sect;. 17, &amp; 18.</HI> compared with 25 <HI>Hen. 8. cap. 19. &amp; 26 Hen. 8. cap. 1.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Iurisdictions, Pri|vileges, Superiorities,</HI> and <HI>Preeminences Spiritual and Ecclesiastical, as by any Spiritual or Ecclesiastical Power or Authority hath heretofore been, &amp;c.</HI> And have <HI>full Power</HI> by Law to Commission <HI>whom they please,</HI> and for <HI>so long time as they please,</HI> to <HI>Visit</HI>

<P><HI>N.</HI> X. Now because the Dean of <HI>Sarum's</HI> Ec|clesiastical Court and Jurisdiction over the Close of New <HI>Sarum</HI> and the Liberties thereof, and elsewhere in four Counties, is for ever united and annexed to the Imperial Crown of this Realm, even as firmly and as fully, as the Courts and Ju|risdictions of any Bishops. (those of <HI>Sarum, Exe|ter,</HI> and <HI>Bristol</HI> in particular;) it concerns the Bishop of <HI>Sarum,</HI> as much as all he hath in the World is worth, not to usurp the King's Authori|ty, nor to invade the Metropolitan's Right, by invading the Dean's; nor to attempt a New Do|minion (from Pope <HI>Boniface</HI> the <HI>Ninth</HI>) without a new Act of <HI>Parliament,</HI> which none were ever yet able (in almost 600 years) to prevail with any King, or any Parliament to endure.</P>
<P><HI>N.</HI> XI. upon the whole matter, All the Pre|misses being consider'd, there can be nothing
<PB N="80" REF="44">
more desirable, if 'tis not absolutely necessary, than that His MAJESTY now in being, will be graciously pleased with the Assistance and Ad|vice of the Archbishop of the Province, (if His Majesty thinks fit) to make and Authenticate such a Body of Statutes for His Majesties Free Chappel and Cathedral Church of <HI>Sarum,</HI> as King <HI>CHARLES</HI> the <HI>First,</HI> of Glorious Memory, did make and constitute for the Cathedral Church of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> with the Assistance and Advice of Archbishop <HI>Laud.</HI> The Church of <HI>Sarum</HI> having as much, if not a much greater need.

Besides that such as they, they are Tumultuary, and Imme|thodical, according to the different Times where|in, the different Occasions whereupon, and the different Authorities whereby they were made. <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">E. g. <HI>those of</HI> Hen. 8.

The like Change is made in the Corporations of Vicars Choral. All oc|casioned (as I suppose) by Marriage permitted to the Clergy. None of our Statutes can be oblig|ing to any beyond the Contriver's Time, unless as made or confirmed by the Law of the Land, or the Kings of <HI>England.</HI> But our Royal Sta|tutes, which alone are Authentick, are most des|pised, as hath been shew'd.</P>

The mischievous consequences of which are too many and too great, within these last Twenty years, to be expressed without a Volume. Whereas our Two Universities can furnish us with men of very good Learning and Degrees, who have much better Voices and greater Skill in Musick, than our Illiterate and Ungraduated
<PB N="82" REF="45">
Songsters. And it is but too evident, how sadly the Church is overstocked with men of Learning and Degrees: the Universities sending out yearly many more of such Men, than the Church hath Employments, (I do not say Preferments) to en|tertain.</P>
<P><HI>N.</HI> XIII. We need say no worse of the <HI>Composition,</HI> made on purpose to overthrow the Fundamental Charter and Statute, than what was said by <HI>Paolo Sarpi</HI> of the <HI>Concordat,</HI> purposely made by <HI>Leo</HI> the <HI>Tenth</HI> to overthrow the <HI>Pragmatic Sanction.</HI> If the Bishop of <HI>Sarum</HI> had no Jurisdiction with|in the Close, <HI>without,</HI> or <HI>before</HI> that <HI>Composition,</HI> why was it not <HI>Invented</HI> almost 300 years sooner?

<P>_SHewing the Dean of <HI>Sarum</HI>'s Inno|cence (if not his Merit) in his <HI>Ser|vices</HI> for the <HI>King,</HI> by the Lords Commissioners special Order; and in his <HI>Obedience</HI> to their <HI>Lordships ex|press Command;</HI> and also in <HI>his per|fect Ignorance</HI> of Mr. <HI>Yeats</HI> his <HI>Address</HI> to the said great Lords with his Four Heads of Infor|mation, until the Lord <HI>Bishop</HI> and the <HI>Chapter of Sarum</HI> gave the Dean his First knowledge and notice of it.

<HI>Abused</HI> by men of Malice; it is the honour and the duty of All the Dean of <HI>Sarum</HI>'s Friends (in the number of whom I profess my self) to <HI>con|vert,</HI> or to <HI>shame</HI> those Fanatical Enemies to the Government, who do <HI>pretend</HI> to suspect him, though indeed they do <HI>not,</HI> and <HI>cannot</HI> suspect him <HI>in Reality,</HI> of having dealt <HI>underhand</HI> in the Design of Mr. <HI>Yeats,</HI> or of having acted otherwise towards any <HI>the least Occasion</HI> of any Controver|sie or Difference with any Creature <HI>Antecedently</HI> to the Command of the Lords Commissioners, the Evidence of the contrary is so <HI>manifold</HI> and <HI>convincing.</HI> But yet they hitherto Resolve to <HI>pretend</HI> suspition, (when they have <HI>None</HI>) where|by to <HI>justify,</HI> or <HI>excuse,</HI> their Diabolical Defama|tion of an innocent Man.

from Mr. <HI>Yeat</HI>'s his own Letters, sent to several Persons of Honour, and to some others of lesser Quality, strongly asserting unto Him|self the whole Design of the Four Heads, which he addressed to the Lords Commissioners; and confuting those Malignants, who out of <HI>Envy</HI> to his Performance, would have him taken (to his Disparagement) for Another man's Tool.

<DIV2 TYPE="appendix">
<HEAD>An <HI>APPENDIX</HI> to the Three fore|going Chapters.</HEAD>
<P>&sect;. 1. MR. <HI>Yeats</HI> was so unwilling, that either the Dean of <HI>Sarum,</HI> or any other of that Church, should have any share with him in the Honour or in the Blame of his Project of the Four Articles, that he writ an honest Letter to a Person of Quality in the Countrey, (as before to some at Court, and to the Lord Bishop him|self) who permitted the Dean's Son to transcribe as much of it, as he thought would conduce to his Father's Service and Satisfaction: And 'tis as follow's.</P>
<P>[<HI>I am heartily sorry that any should be so Atheisti|cal, as still to suspect the Dean's privity to my design, after so much evidence and conviction to the contrary; and therefore to shame them, I am ready to undergo</HI> whatever Test <HI>shall be put upon me, to declare that the Dean was neither</HI> directly <HI>nor</HI> indirectly, nec per se, nec per alium, <HI>acquainted with my design, but every way as ignorant thereof, as the Child unborn; and much less abetting me therein, than the Bishop himself from whom I had indeed two Inducements, but</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="48">
<HI>from the Dean none, nay less than none; this being the only way I had to incur the Dean's Displeasure, but withal to procure a Favour from the Bishop, or at least from the King himself. The</HI> only offence <HI>that I Can charge my self herein to be guilty of,</HI> and for which I do, and must ever beg the Pardon of Mr. Dean, <HI>is not only that I drew up those Articles with|out his</HI> Privity, <HI>or</HI> Assistance, but also without his knowledge or consent, <HI>referr'd my self for Proof of them</HI> to Books and Papers in his Hands. <HI>Truth is, the knowledge I had of the chief things suggested by me to the Lords Commissioners, was principally</HI> from a Sheet of Reasons whereof Copies had been dis|persed into several mens hands, as well of both Houses of Parliament, as private Persons, One of which Copies I have here with me, <HI>penned by the Dean about Six Years since, which Sheet was Entitled,</HI>&mdash;Certain Memoirs of things pleadable a|gainst a Bill then prepared for the taking away of all Peculiar Jurisdictions, &amp;c. <HI>wherein among others, I found this very observable Passage.</HI></P>
<P>The Dean and <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Note that this was an error in those Memoirs. For the Dean was <HI>Alone</HI> before the Conquest, and some while <HI>After</HI> without any Chapter, as now the Dean of the King's Chappel at <HI>White-Hall is.</HI></NOTE> Canons of <HI>Sarum</HI> had their abode before the Conquest in <HI>Old Castle</HI> called <HI>Caesar</HI>'s <HI>Burg,</HI> and corruptly <HI>Sarisberg,</HI> by the <HI>Brittains, Sorbiodunum.</HI> It was at the first <HI>the King</HI>'s <HI>Free Chappel, as Windsor is</HI> at this day, wherein the Dean (<HI>under the King</HI>) had more than Episcopal Jurisdiction. <HI>Vide Vetus Registr. Miscell. &amp; Registr. Dom.</HI> Richardi <HI>Episc.</HI> Sarum.</P>
<P>[<HI>'Twas from this, and certain other Passages there following, (seconded by what</HI> I heard from some
<PB N="90" REF="49">
<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><HI>N. B.</HI> He consulted with others, though not with the Dean.</NOTE> Persons better known, as I thought, in the Affairs and Records of that Church, than I can be supposed to be,) <HI>that I thought I had reason enough humbly to tender those Four things to be inquired into by their Lordships. But for the Reverend Dean of</HI> Sarum, <HI>he had no manner of knowledge of my De|sign, or of my Two Inducements <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter">o it, nor of the Pe|tition of the Mayor and Magistrates of</HI> Marlborough, <HI>nor of those Noble Persons who did promote it; and therefore as I have highly though undesignedly diso|bliged him, by acting as I did, without his Privity, and (as I found since) against his Will; so I have, and do, and ever will beg his Pardon; which whether I ever obtain, or not, I will be ever his Vindicator in the bottom of my Heart, from his having had the least share, or so much as knowledge of my Rashness and Precipitancy.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. II. Thus far Mr. <HI>Yeats</HI> word for word; and as truly as ever any man spake: He offered also to confirm it in open Court upon Oath, which makes me say, that those men are unworthy, and must not expect to be believed upon their Oaths, much less upon their Words, who will not be|lieve the Dean of <HI>Sarum,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Cornelius Yeats</HI> of <HI>Marlborough</HI> either upon their Words, or upon their Oaths. Mr. <HI>Yeats</HI> his Character is no where fitter to be seen, than in the famous Petition of the Mayor and Magistrates of <HI>Marlborough</HI> to the King, Presented by the hands of the Lord <HI>Bruce</HI> in his behalf, whose great Parts and greater Piety are celebrated by Them, (both to the King, and the Lords Commissioners,) who have the best <HI>ex|perience</HI> and <HI>knowledge</HI> of him. And not yet to
<PB N="91" REF="49">
mention those Horrid and Scandalous Reports, which Mr. <HI>Yeats</HI> his bitter Enemies have labour|ed under, and still do labour.</P>
<P>There are not any either of his, or of the Dean of <HI>Sarum</HI>'s Enemies, who can prove so convin|cingly that they had not any hand in, or Assent to, or Connivance at, or Knowledge of the most execrable Murder of Sir <HI>Edmundbury Godfrey,</HI> (until they had it by report,) as the said Dean hath proved, and can prove, that he had <HI>no hand in, or Assent to, or Connivance at, or Knowledge of,</HI> Mr. <HI>Yeats</HI> his Project of the Four Articles, until he was informed of it by the Lord Bishop of <HI>Sa|rum,</HI> and by the Chapter of the same, in a Letter from Mr. <HI>Frome.</HI> For Sir <HI>Edm. Godfrey</HI> being dead, can attest nothing on their behalf; and they have nothing but their own Oaths whereby to clear their own Innocence, to which they have forfeited all Belief with considering men. But Mr. <HI>Yeats</HI> is still living to clear the Dean of <HI>Sarum</HI> upon his Oath, the which he offered in open Court, and will be ever ready to take, and who will ever find Belief from All who are ac|quainted with his unblameable Conversation, which will every where have credit, where his Enemies have None. Nor hath he, or the Dean of <HI>Sarum</HI> any Enemies they know of, who are not Enemies at the same time, both to God, and the King, and the Church of <HI>England.</HI> 'Tis the Nature of Christian Charity, not to suspect others hastily, of any ill thing which it abhors; whilst they who are wont to do Injuries, suspect others of the like. Nothing hitherto can be said to clear the Regular and Episcopal Clergy from a suspition of being Papists, or Popishly affected, with the whole Dissenting and Schis|matical
<PB N="92" REF="50">
Party; and they who suspected, or rather <HI>pretended</HI> to suspect the Dean of <HI>Sarum</HI> of a Plot to deprive the Bishop of a Right to give Prebends, even immediately after the Bishop had promised a Prebend to the Dean's Son, (of his own accord, and undesired, which added most of all to the Obligation,) are like those most Malitious, and Unexcusable Fanaticks, who pretended to suspect the King himself, not only of contriving the Fire of <HI>London,</HI> but also of being in the plot a|gainst his own Life and Kingdom. See the ex|cellent <HI>Address to all the Freeholders and Freemen of</HI> England; part. 1. pag. 45, and 50. and part. 2. pag. 2, 3, 5, 6.</P>
<P>&sect;. 3. But now suppose the Dean of <HI>Sarum</HI> had not only permitted, but perswaded Mr. <HI>Yeats</HI> and the Magistrates of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> to apply them|selves unto the King for a Prebend of <HI>Sarum,</HI> and to plead, that the Supremacy of Right to give Prebends is in the King, from whose Original Right, the Bishops Right to give them is but derivative, (and therefore only a good and un|doubted Right, because derived from the Crown,) he had not abjured the doing of it, but rather had owned it with Ambition. The only Reason why he denies it, is because it is a Lye; and be|cause he is a lover of Truth and Justice; and be|cause he will not willingly fully the Merit of his Obedience to the very express Commands of the Lords Commissioners; who finding him averse from his being a Voluntier, were therefore pleas|ed to press him for his Majesties Service, where|in he had not been else employed.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="50">&sect;. 4. In compliance with the said Order and peremptory Command of the Lords Commissio|ners, (to which no Churchman could refuse to pay Obedience,) the Dean of <HI>Sarum</HI> drew up a <HI>Narrative</HI> of <HI>Matters of Fact&punc;</HI> which he had found in Old Registers; wherein he took occasion to censure Mr. <HI>Yeats,</HI> &sect;. 9. and to assert the Lord Bishop of <HI>Sarum</HI>'s Right to dispose of Dignities, Sub-Dignities and Prebends at large, &sect;. 10. as well as the Right of the Dean singly, together with the Rights of Dean and Chapter in conjunction. And all upon the same principle or ground, on which he humbly did conceive the several Rights were all held: He did conceive, that all Rights are either <HI>Subordinate</HI> or <HI>Supream:</HI> He thought it dangerous to assert the Subjects Rights to be <HI>Supream,</HI> and therefore called them <HI>Subordinate:</HI> And lastly, He thought their Rights the <HI>Firmer,</HI> for being derived from, and depending on, and standing upon so <HI>sure a Bottom</HI> as the <HI>Supream.</HI> He shew'd what our Monarchs had done <HI>de facto</HI> in and over the Church of <HI>Sarum,</HI> which was not to reveal a Secret; for some of the Alienations of several Prebends, and one Archdeaconry, from that Church, are publickly written in Let|ters of Gold on the several Stalls, and exposed to the Reading of all Mankind. But whether such Alienations were, or could be <HI>de Iure,</HI> the said Dean left humbly to the Consideration of his Superiors.</P>
<P>What more or less could have been said to that purpose, by any of the Chapter, or by them All, or by my Lord Bishop himself, if either of them had been so commanded to speak his Knowledge, or his Sense, as the Dean of <HI>Sarum</HI> was, they
<PB N="94" REF="51">
themselves can best tell; but the Dean of <HI>Sarum</HI> is yet to learn.</P>
<P>&sect;. 5. One thing is fit to be considered by those Pretenders to a suspicion of Persons more credi|ble than themselves; which suspicion 'tis thought they have not, and cannot have in good earnest, against the Evidence and Conviction they have several times met with; if at least they have Faith and Charity, and do really believe there is a God, and a Devil, and Heaven and Hell. Sup|pose that two of their Number shall be pretended to be suspected of two grand Crimes, the one of <HI>Simony,</HI> and the other of <HI>Incest;</HI> and that the Whispers of those Suspicions shall be disseminated and spread into publick Fame. Will not those Persons be glad to be allowed to prove the Nega|tive upon their Oaths? Will they not take it ex|treamly ill, to get no more by their Vindication, than to have the Fame of <HI>Perjury,</HI> superadded to the suspicions both of Simony, and Incest? Will they not expostulate, <HI>si accusasse suffecerit, Quis erit Innocuus?</HI> Will they not probably break out into the Learned <HI>Diatribist</HI>'s Exclamation, <GAP DESC="foreign">! They can|not hope to be believed upon their own single Oaths, who dare pretend not to believe honester Men upon their double ones. Besides that <HI>Simony</HI> and <HI>Incest</HI> will be accounted more scandalous, even by the Whigs in these worst of Times, than to be zealous for the King's Rights, or to obey the Lords Commissioners. And therefore, if the In|venters of silly Jealousies and Lyes, shall at any time chance to suffer the heinous things which they have done, they will learn for the future to deal with their Neighbours and their Friends, as
<PB N="95" REF="51">
they would that their Enemies should deal with Them.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>Part of Mr. <HI>Cornelius Yeats</HI> his LETTER to a Person of Great Honour, an Eminent Officer at Court, and afterwards to another of lesser Quality; giving an Account of his Un|dertaking, after the Petition of the Mayor and Magistrates of <HI>Marlborough</HI> to the KING in his behalf.</HEAD>
<P><HI>BEsides my appearing for the King's Prerogative and Right, which was a principal Motive to this so strange Attempt of mine, I had likewise two other Inducements, which I hope may in some</HI> measure take off the blame, <HI>and very tolerably account for a Proce|dure of this Nature.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The One, that</HI> the Bishop <HI>of</HI> Sarum <HI>some years since</HI> voluntarily promised, and that with repea|ted Asseverations, (<HI>I do not say the next Prebend, but</HI>) whatever lay in his Power to do for me; <HI>though being since that time, again and again Requested by me, and by many Others,</HI> (<HI>not considerable Persons</HI>) <HI>on my behalf, at what time there were vacant Prebends many in one Year, yet he never did any thing towards the Augmentation of my Poor Maintenance: so that indeed I was weary of depending any longer upon Com|plements.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Next, I did but follow</HI> (<HI>as I was led,</HI>) <HI>the Bishops own Example; for having observed, that his Lord|ship applyed himself to the King for a Royal</HI> Mandate, <HI>whereby to over Rule the Dean and Chapter of</HI> Sarum <HI>to Praeelect his Nephew Mr.</HI> Seth Ward <HI>into the next Place of Residence which should be void,</HI> (<HI>the only Good Thing which is in the Gift of the Dean and Chapter, when the King does not oppose his Original Right to</HI>
<PB N="96" REF="52">
<HI>their Derivative,</HI>) <HI>I thought I might with greater Reason apply my self</HI> (<HI>in such a way as I did,</HI> viz. <HI>by asserting the Kings Original Right,</HI>) <HI>to obtain from His Majesty a Prebend at large of a lesser Value</HI> (<HI>not the only Good Thing in the Bishops Gift, by a De|rivative Right, whereof the Original is in the King,</HI>) <HI>because that Nephew had been before provided for by two Uncle-Bishops, with as much as would have ser|ved five or six Worthy men, and did not want an Augmentation; as I evidently did; nor was his Task so great, as mine is very well known to have always been; nor did his Uncle want Things in his particular Disposal, as most of my Patrons did, and do; nor had the Bishop more Right Derivative to bestow a Prebend at large, than the Dean and Chapter to be|stow the Places of Residence: and his Lordships apply|ing himself to the King for such a Canonry was</HI> (<HI>accor|ing to the Rules of all the Logick that I ever have been acquainted with</HI>) <HI>a Confession of his Iudgment, that All Promotions in the Cathedral Church of</HI> Sarum <HI>are in the King by an Original Right, though by a Derivative in the Bishop partly, and partly in the Dean and Chapter; and truly Sir, I had a fairer Opini|on of his Lordship than to think he would blame that in me, which he approved of in himself: Nor did I imagine, but that a Poor Vicar might beg what he wanted of his King, as well as a Great and Rich Bishop, who wanted nothing.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sir, I have here freely and fully discovered the very sense and thoughts of my Heart to you, and do humbly hope, that I may from You at least obtain a merciful and candid Opinion of my Proceedings. But I am afraid I have wearied you with the unusual length of this Letter; I am sure I have wearied my self in writing it, having already preached twice this day, and being also to prepare another Sermon at a Funeral</HI>
