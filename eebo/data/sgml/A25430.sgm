<HEAD>To the Right Honourable the Lord ALTHAM.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAving taken occasion to present the following Papers of your Noble and Learned Father to the World, I held my self obliged to make a particular Dedication of 'em to your self, in whom so much of the Acuteness of his Wit, and of his incomparable Mo|desty, and of his Loyalty to his Prince, and Conformity to the Church, Fidelity in Friend|ship, and Candour of Disposi|tion and Manners, is Conspi|cuous to the World: And by which latter Qualification your
<PB REF="3">
Conversation is perfectly char|ming to all who have the Ho|nour of it.</P>
<P>His Lordships great value of these generous qualities in you, was often signified to me by him in my more than twenty five years frequent Conversati|on with him in the latter part of his Life; and wherein you gave him so much just Cause to presage, that your Lordship would be both a Propp and an Ornament to his Family.</P>
<P>And I doubt not but those Great and Manly efforts of his Reason, Religion and Learn|ing that I here lay before your thoughts, will be further In|ducements to you to make a Na|tural use of his great Example, and to spend as much of your
<PB REF="3">
Life, as you can spare from the Service of your Country, in the most vigorous pursuits after Knowledge, and in the investi|gation of Truth; and for your doing which, you have in the Course of Nature so fair a prospect of a long race of Life before you.</P>
<P>His Lordship used often to quote occasionally that saying of my Lord Bacon's, <HI>Actio est Conversatio cum Stultis, lectio autem cum Sapientibus</HI>: The thought whereof induced him to spend so much of his time in his Library; and where he u|sually loc'kd himself up so close, that in stead of fortifying his Interest at Court, as great Men do, by frequent giving of Visits to one another he very
<PB REF="4">
much avoided the receiving them.</P>
<P>And therefore he having so vast a Collection of Choice Books both in the Ancient and Modern Languages, and especially of Divinity, Com|mon-Law, Civil Law, Canon-Law, and History; and laying the Scene of his Life so much among them&punc; and living to a good Old Age, the World might well expect that what he should leave behind him of his own Composing, should be worthy of himself, and it: And such your Lordship will find this Volume to be.</P>
<P>The first Work of your Fa|thers, that I shall Entertain your Lordship and the World with, is that of his Letter to
<PB REF="4" MS="y">
my self, of <HI>Iuly</HI> the 18<HI>th.</HI> 1683, Writ on the occasion of my minding him of his yearly Cu|stom of sending Venison to Sir <HI>George Ent</HI>; and which Letter is variously instructful to the Age. I placed before his large <HI>Dis|course</HI> by way of <HI>Letter</HI> to me in Answer of Mine to him of that Nature, because the Or|der of time required it.</P>
<P>He had my entire <HI>Discourse</HI> by him in his Study, Printed and bound up long before he dyed. And his Lordship telling me, that he intended his by way of return to it, and to be Prin|ted in <HI>Folio</HI> to be bound up with mine; mine thereby happen'd not to be Published in his Life time.</P>
<P>It was afterward Published with the Title of <HI>the Happy Fu|ture
<PB REF="5">
State of</HI> England, and since by a new Title, viz, <HI>A Discourse of the growth of</HI> England, <HI>in po|pulousness and trade since the Re|formation,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Printed for</HI> Wil|liam Rogers, <HI>at the Sun over a|gainst St.</HI> Dunstans Church <HI>in</HI> Fleet-Street.</P>
<P>And as all great Writers (and especially of such Subjects that refer to various kinds of Learn|ing) have Customarily employ|ed several persons in gathering Quotations for them, and ab|stracting them (and as for this purpose, I have some where Ci|ted the <HI>Lord Secretary Falkland,</HI> for saying of <HI>Cardinal Peron,</HI> that <HI>Baronius</HI> and <HI>Bellarmine</HI> were but fit to gather Quotati|ons for him) so your Father was pleased to Crave the Aid
<PB REF="5">
of Quotations from his Learn|ed Friend <HI>Bishop Barlow,</HI> in two or three Points relating to The|ology and the Canon Law, and which were sent to him in Let|ters. I scarce know any one Man who is so absolute a Ma|ster of all the various kinds of Learning refer'd to in your Fa|thers large following <HI>Discourse,</HI> as to have commanded the pro|per use thereof, without apply|ing to the Labour of some o|ther Friend in this kind. Nor have any of the most Learned of the Jesuits presumed to Pub|lish the most Famous and Ela|borate of their Volumes, either Historical or Mathematical, without owing a beholding|ness to others for Quotations.</P>
<P>And as any one here, who
<PB REF="6">
entertains a great Prince in a Splendid manner, holds himself obliged not to confine himself to his own Ground for all the Materials of his Treat, so he who invites to his Entertain|ment no meaner a <HI>Guest</HI> than the <HI>World</HI> by his Writings, ought not to Disdain the use of the Heads or Hands of others in finding out the most Curious Provision for it, and especially in so Critical an Age as this.</P>
<P>But even herein was your Fa|thers great Modesty so Signal, as to shew that he designed not the Appropriating wholy to himself the Honour of all the <HI>Bishops</HI> Learned and Judicious Quotations (and which yet by the Custom of other great Wri|ters, he might have justifiably
<PB REF="6">
done) that he is pleased to no|tifie to the World in <HI>p.</HI> 21. his having apply'd to the <HI>Bishop</HI> on that account, and what Com|munications he had from him by Letters, and his desire of their Publication.</P>
<P>Another great instance of his Exuberant Modesty, I shall here Entertain your Lordship with, is the great Complement he was pleased to put on me, when not very long before his last Sickness, he delivered to me his large <HI>Discourse</HI> as fair|ly Writ out by his <HI>Amanuenses,</HI> and variously altered by his own Hand (and the which af|ter the Printers have made use of, I intend to offer to your Lordships Cabinet) and desired me, that I would take the same
<PB REF="7">
Freedom in putting out, or De|leting any thing I thought Su|perfluous or proper to be ex|punged, as he told me, Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI> had desired me to do when I Published his Excellent Book of <HI>The Style of the Scriptures.</HI> Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI> in a Letter to me Printed before that Book, Addrest it to me with the Initial Letters of Mr. <HI>P.P. A.G. F.I.</HI> (by which he meant to refer to me as <HI>Ad|vocate General for</HI> Ireland, and giving a Friendly Reason for not more openly naming me.) And he is there pleased to say, <HI>I have been obliged, that I might obey you, not only to Dismember, but to Mangle the Treatise you perused, cutting out here a whole side, and there half, and in ano|ther place perhaps a quarter of one.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="7">And if it had so pleased God, that your Father had lived any considerable time longer, I would have humbly offered it to his Consideration, to have some Passages there omitted, and par|ticularly that wherein he giveth his thoughts of somewhat in <HI>p.</HI> 70. of my <HI>Discourse,</HI> and like|wise those wherein his Lordship is pleased to signifie his over-va|luing of my poor Sixth-rate Ta|lents, and my performance in my Work. But since he lived not long enough for my having an opportunity to satisfie him with my Reasons, for the leaving out any passages, as I did the in|comparable Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI> I presum'd not to delete any thing therein, worth the speaking of. But as I took great Care to watch the
<PB REF="8">
Press in my Publication of that Noble Work of Mr. <HI>Boyles,</HI> to prevent the Printers <HI>Errata,</HI> so I have in this of your Fathers.</P>
<P>The Author of the <HI>Athenae Oxonienses</HI> having among the <HI>Lives</HI> of the <HI>Oxford Writers,</HI> Writ that of your Father, is there plea|sed to mention, that in the be|ginning of the <HI>year</HI> 1686. <HI>He began to be admitted into the Fa|vour of King</HI> James <HI>the</HI> II. But he was admitted into his Maje|sties Favour before; and Mr. <HI>Ryley</HI> after your Fathers Death, shew'd me this in his Lordships <HI>Diary,</HI> viz. <HI>On</HI> March 8.85. <HI>Spent most at home in Business; and Duty</HI> (i. e. Prayer) <HI>In the Even|ing was private with the Lord</HI> Sunderland, <HI>my good Friend; and then was with the King a full hour
<PB REF="8">
at Mr.</HI> Chiffinches; <HI>who was ve|ry kind, free, and open in Discourse: Said, he would not be Priest-rid|den; Read a Letter of the Late King, said I should be welcome to him.</HI> I refer to this, to shew like|wise on what Terms he stood in the Royal Favour (and which was so great to him, that his Friends supposed, that had he lived a Month longer, he would have been Lord Chancellour) and that his zeal for his Religion, suf|fered no Diminution thereby, and which sufficiently appeared by the Picture of his mind drawn by himself in the following <HI>Dis|course,</HI> and to which he was then applying his finishing Touches.</P>
<P>And hence the Reader may guess, that his private Belief of his Prince not designing the un|settlement
<PB REF="9">
of our Religion, En|couraged him in his thoughts of Loyalty, and in his Inculca|ting the Moral Offices of it so much throughout the follow|ing <HI>Discourse.</HI></P>
<P>And indeed his Advices then about it, were but Eccho's to the Pulpits of the Divines of the Church of <HI>England</HI> in general, that rang with it till the time of the setting up the Ecclesiastical High Commis|ssion, and by virtue of which, they had apprehensions of their being removeable out of their Church-Freeholds in two or three days time: And where|upon they had (as I may say, in the School-Divinity Terms) the <HI>motus primo primi,</HI> to think that the <HI>Affirmative</HI> precepts of
<PB REF="9">
Preaching up Loyalty in their Sermons as before, did not bind <HI>Semper &amp; ad Semper.</HI> But your Father was in his Grave, before the Birth of that Commission, and it was several Months after in that year 1686. before the Commissioners opened their Commission, and which they did on <HI>Tuesday</HI> the 3<HI>d.</HI> of <HI>August</HI> that year.</P>
<P>However it may be said that no Revolutions time can cause, can make persuasives to Loyal|ty wholy useless, or it cease to be a Vertue, or to want the Sup|port of any Government, and which must be supported by it.</P>
<P>But your Fathers growth in his Habitual <HI>Loyalty,</HI> when he was so near his End, needs no <HI>Apology.</HI> And according to the
<PB REF="10">
observation I have met with from some of our Practical Divines that <HI>God watcheth when his Child is at the best, and his Graces ripest, and then takes him,</HI> thus was it with your Noble Father.</P>
<P>And as no thought can be more obvious to a prudent States-Man&punc; who was for a time Employed by his Prince in a Provincial King|dom under his Vice-Roy, and was preparing to return to his King, and to be under his Eye, than that 'tis his great concern to part fair|ly with the <HI>Vice-Roy,</HI> and not to be conscious of having Dishonoured, or of having render'd him uneasie in the discharge of his Office; so neither can it be unthought of by any Pious Minister of Kings (who are Gods Vice-Gerents) that it highly imports him after his splen|did
<PB REF="10">
Sojourning here, to have the Testimonials of a good Consci|ence, ready to carry to Heaven with him, that he here Honoured the great King of Heaven and Earth, in the persons of such Vice-gerents, and did not by stirring up any popular ferments, trouble their Administration and frustrate their Counsels.</P>
<P>Had your Father lived to have come to the Helm of State, as a <HI>primier Ministre,</HI> I believe his in|fluence would have prevented ma|ny inconveniences that happened by the Bigotry, Pedantry, and blind zeal of some particu|lar papists. For tho I have own'd to the World in print, the excel|lent Tempers and Justice and prudence of some Great Roman-Catholicks then, yet I have often
<PB REF="11">
been diverted by the impotent passion of some certain Popish Bi|gots, who, because I in my Book which I designed as perswasive a|gainst the Exclusion, &amp; the growth of the popular fears of Papists and Popery, and wrote in the tur|bid interval of the Kingdom, the interval of panic Fears, and when the Ayre of Mens fancies was ge|nerally infected, and the Kingdom was in a Chaos-like condition, thought it necessary to Demon|strate, that I was a <HI>Non-Papist,</HI> and not to dilate in invectives against the Belief of any popish Plot what|soever, and against all the Witnes|ses in particular, were pleased in common talk, to shoot the bolts of their Censures against me and my Works. And the truth is, for any writer for the aforesaid pur|poses,
<PB REF="11">
to have then appeared in such a <HI>Dress,</HI> as they would have had him, would have shew'd as strangely, as when it once happen|ed, that one being to Act <HI>Theseus</HI> in <HI>Hercules furens</HI> coming out of Hell, he could not for a long time be perswaded to wear some old sooty Clothes, but would needs come out of Hell in a white Sat|tin Doublet.</P>
<P>Your Fathers Learned Book may in various places, teach such Censorious bigots common sense. And his Lordship justly coming under the Character of <GAP DESC="foreign">, I may account his single acknow|ledgment of my performance, to out-weigh Myriads of such Igno|rant Censurers, and be very well content with my having escaped the Scandal of their praise.</P>
<P><PB REF="12">But here I must needs say, that as I have sufficiently shewn in print, the aversion of my Humour from courting the popular praise of any party (as having judged that the medicament of Notions I applyed to each, would be neces|sarily helped in the working by the ungratefulness of the Taste) so by my having so long delay'd the publication of this excellent Volume of your Father, I have shewn some uneasiness or back|wardness in receiving the various Honour he was pleased in his short Letter prefixed, and following large one, to do to that Work of mine, which in obedience to his Commands, and for the doing him Justice I wrote.</P>
<P>And I believe, had not a Learn|ed and Prudent Friend of mine
<PB REF="12">
of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> told me, that my being thus accessory to the publishing of your Fathers Lauda|tory Acknowledgments of my per|formance, was as much consistent with the Laws of Modesty as is many grave and wise Authors pre|fixing Commendatory Verses or Prose-testimonials from others be|fore their works (and for which pur|pose, he told me of Mr. <HI>Hobbes</HI> having before a philosophical and politi|cal Work of his, printed some ex|cellent verses of Dr. <HI>Bathurst</HI>; and of Dr. <HI>Templer</HI> having printed some of another before his admirable Confutation of <HI>Leviathan</HI>) and withal represented it to me, that I was in Conscience bound to the supporting the Honour of our Church, by the publishing the New Matter contained in your Fathers
<PB REF="13">
Book against popery, and likewise to the supporting the Justice of our Compassion, for the sufferings of our Brethren in <HI>France</HI> by the Bigottry of the <HI>French</HI> Clergy, upon the account of their not owning the Faith of the Council of <HI>Trent,</HI> (your Fathers Book beyond all o|ther Writings published, so clearly shewing it out of the most Authen|tick Histories, that that Council was never published and received in <HI>France</HI>) I should have been incli|ned to have Transmitted this in|comparable <HI>Discourse</HI> of his Lord|ship, to have lived only in the <HI>Ar|chives</HI> of the <HI>Oxford-Library.</HI> And so chiefly by the weight of this latter Consideration, I have held my self obliged to make it pub|lick: And I doubt not but all pro|testants, and especially our <HI>Divines</HI>
<PB REF="13">
of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> will bid it welcome to the World.</P>
<P>But <HI>My Lord,</HI> I am to crave your Lordships Pardon, for thus long detaining your thoughts from the Great and Noble ones of your Fa|thers in the following <HI>Discourse</HI>; and will no longer offend therein, than by Subscribing my self,</P>

<HEAD>From my <HI>Tusculanum, Totte|ridge, Iuly</HI> 18. 1683.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir <HI>Peter Pett.</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> Obeyed your Commands in giv|ing the great Sr. <HI>George Ent</HI> a taste of my <HI>villa</HI> fare. I hope you seasoned it with your wonted good discourse; I envy you nothing of your Happiness, but that I had not a part in it; for I delight in nothing more than such Company from whom I ever part the better and the wiser. I acknowledge the favour in the two <HI>Sheets</HI> you sent me, which were so far from satisfying me, that they served but to whet my appetite to desire, that you would after so long an expectation given, <HI>ultimam manum ponere</HI> to that work, wherein you do <HI>pingere aeternita|ti</HI>; and from which it is pitty the
<PB REF="14">
publick should be with-held longer.</P>
<P>I remember after <HI>Cicero's</HI> incom|parable parts and learning had advanced him in <HI>Rome</HI> to the high|est Honours &amp; Offices of that fa|mous Common wealth, that by <HI>Cae|sars</HI> Vsurpations upon the publick, there was no longer place either in the Senate or Hall of Iustice, for the <HI>Romanum Eloquium</HI> he had made so much his Study, and where|in he had before <HI>Caesar</HI> himself shewed how much he excelled, he betook himself wholy to the com|mon consolation of wise Men in di|stress, the use and practice of Phi|losophy, and therein with an indu|stry and stile answerable to the di|viness of the purpose, undertook for the benefit of all Ages, the most Re|ligious and Sacred part of Philo|sophy, the <HI>Nature</HI> of the <HI>God-Head,</HI>
<PB REF="15">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">

wherein amidst a cloud of various and opposite errours, and the thick darkness of a benighted ignorance, he acquitted himself to admiration, insomuch, that I may account <HI>him</HI> as some great Au|thors have done, the <HI>Divine</HI> Phi|losopher as well as <HI>Seneca.</HI></P>
<P>And if I had reason to doubt what his opinion might be concer|ning a <HI>Deity,</HI> or whether his works evince not the <HI>true</HI> Deity and Re|ligion, yet I am sure they tend strongly to the overthrowing the <HI>False</HI>: Which the very worship|pers of those <HI>ignoti Dei</HI> were so sensible of, that they conspired the Destruction of this work of his, in|somuch that in the Reign of <HI>Dio|clesian</HI> that great <HI>Bigott</HI> (as I may call him) of the <HI>Heathenish</HI> Ido|latry, and the Enemy of the <HI>Chri|stian</HI>
<PB REF="16">
Religion, these three Books <HI>De natur&acirc; Deorum,</HI> and his other two of <HI>Divination,</HI> were publickly <HI>burnt</HI> in company with the writings of the Chri|stians, <HI>Anno Christi 302.</HI> as most fa|mous <HI>Chronologers</HI> and others have recorded. In particular <HI>Arnobius</HI> sharply (tho then no <HI>Christian</HI>) in|veighs against the burners of these Books of <HI>Cicero,</HI> in these words, viz. <HI>But be|fore all others,</HI> Tully <HI>the most Elo|quent of the Romans, not fearing the imputation of Impiety, with great Ingenuity, Freedom and Ex|actness shews what his thoughts were, and yet</HI> (saith he) <HI>I hear of some, that are much transported a|gainst these Books of his, and give out, that the Senate ought to De|cree the abolishing of them, as bringing countenance to the Chri|stian Religion, and impairing the
<PB REF="17">
Authority of Antiquity: rather</HI> (said he) <HI>if you believe you have ought certain to deliver, as to your Deities, convince</HI> Cicero <HI>of Error, confute and explode his evil Do|ctrine. For to destroy Writings, or go about to hinder the common Reading of them, is not to defend the Gods; but to be afraid of the Testimony of Truth.</HI> Thus far <HI>Arno|bius.</HI> And I could not leave <HI>Cicero</HI> and his Books in a more illustrious place than amidst those bright flames, where|in the Divine writings were consumed&punc; For what greater Honour than for him to be joyned with <HI>Christ,</HI> in the same cause and punishment? I should not have so far advanced the pattern of <HI>Cicero</HI> in a <HI>Christian</HI> Kingdom, but that we are so far degenerated from the primi|tive ones, that <HI>Tullyes</HI> Morality if not Divinity, goes beyond us. When the Age
<PB REF="17">
is Receptive of better examples (though you need them not) I should willingly in|sinuate them to others.</P>
<P>Now if by the beginnings of <HI>Persecu|tion</HI> in <HI>France</HI> and other parts, and the dangerous Divisions and Circumstances at home, we seem to be hurrying to the like sad times, you may guess what makes me embrace so much a Country life as <HI>Cicero did,</HI> and that from the Noise and Contrivances of a croud in the City, I am retired to the sweet <HI>quiet of a Tusculanum,</HI> and to converse with the dead <HI>qui non mordent:</HI> and if I de|clare I should be glad (among the Tombs) of such company as you and other my good friends that perhaps in kindness to me think me wanting there, you will be|lieve me no ill chooser for my self, and I hope squander away some time upon a friend. You see I give a beginning to our entercourse, wherein you were not wont
<PB REF="18">
to flinch; and when you write to <HI>Bug|den,</HI> pray let the Learned and good <HI>Bi|shop</HI> know, I am as much his as ever, tho the whole Body of <HI>Papists</HI> seem now to be confuting his before Iudged irrefragable Book, and bring in the pro|testants by Head and Shoulders, to what he evinced were their Maxims and practice; so that now <HI>Mutato no|mine de nobis fabula narratur.</HI> But the <HI>God</HI> of truth, in the <HI>thing</HI> wherein they deal <HI>proudly</HI> and falsly will shew himself above them; to him I commit you, and in him I am</P>

<PB N="17" REF="26">
while in expecting your <HI>Second</HI> thoughts, and without <HI>boding</HI> ill of your being any way par|tial therein; yet shall here at present acquaint you, that as I am a <HI>Member</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> as now by <HI>Law</HI> Esta|blished, I will not Recede a <HI>Iot</HI> from its <HI>Doctrine,</HI> by Judging the <HI>Papacy</HI> not to be <HI>Antichrist,</HI> or by judging the Worshipping the <HI>Host,</HI> not to be <HI>formal</HI> Idolatry, as my Ho|noured Friends, Dr. <HI>Hammond</HI> and <HI>Bishop Taylor</HI> (as you say) have done: And shall here ob|serve to you, that tho' Bishop <HI>Taylor</HI> in his <HI>Liberty of Prophe|cying,</HI> pronounced <HI>Worshiping</HI> the <HI>Host,</HI> to be not <HI>FORMAL Idolatry,</HI> yet afterward upon more Mature thoughts, he in
<PB N="18" REF="27">
his <HI>Disswasive against Popery,</HI> did make it <HI>FORMAL Idolatry.</HI></P>
<P>I shall likewise tell you, that Bishop <HI>Sanderson,</HI> whom you so often <HI>quote,</HI> and whose Judgment you so deservedly Celebrate, doth amongst his <HI>Sermons</HI> printed <HI>Anno</HI> 1657. in the <HI>fifth</HI> Sermon, <HI>Ad Populum p.</HI> 287. in plain Terms call the Pope <HI>the Man of Sin</HI>; the <HI>Text</HI> of the Sermon is 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.4. The Bishop there represents the <HI>Church of Rome</HI> as <HI>injurious</HI> to our <HI>Christian Liberty,</HI> whom St. <HI>Paul</HI> in this <HI>passage</HI> (saith he) hath branded with an indeli|ble note of <HI>Infamy</HI>; in as much as those very <HI>Doctrines,</HI> where|in he gives an instance, as <HI>Do|ctrines of Devils,</HI> are the <HI>receiv|ed Tenets</HI> and <HI>Conclusions</HI> of that <HI>Church,</HI> not to insist on
<PB N="19" REF="27">
other prejudices done to <HI>Christi|an Liberty</HI> by the <HI>intolerable Vsur|pation</HI> of the <HI>Man of Sin</HI>: where he refers in his Margent to 2 <HI>Th.</HI> 2, 3. who <HI>exerciseth a Spiritual Tyranny</HI> over Mens <HI>Consciences,</HI> as opposite to <HI>Evangelical Li|berty,</HI> as <HI>Antichrist</HI> is to <HI>Christ. Let us a little see how she hath fulfilled St.</HI> Pauls <HI>Prediction, in teaching Lying and Divelish Do|ctrines, and that with seared Consciences and in Hypocrisie,</HI> in the <HI>two Specialties mentioned in the next verse,</HI> viz. <HI>Forbidding to Marry; and commanding to ab|stain from Meats.</HI> And then the Bishop saith, <HI>Marriage, the Holy Ordinance of God, is yet by this purple Strumpet forbidden, and that</HI> Sub Mortali to <HI>Bishops, Priests, Deacons, &amp;c.</HI> and he
<PB N="20" REF="28">
there for that Appellation of <HI>purple Strumpet,</HI> refers in his Margent to, <HI>Rev.</HI> 17.13.</P>
<P>And as I have here cited this great B. for this purpose; so I may likewise refer you to the work of our B. of <HI>Lincoln</HI> called <HI>Brutum Fulmen,</HI> as proving the Pope to be <HI>Antichrist,</HI> contrary to the Assertions of <HI>Grotius</HI> and Dr. <HI>Hammond</HI> and others: I never think of this Bishop, and of his Incomparable Knowledge, both in Theology and Church-History, and in the Ecclesi|astical Law, without applying to him in my Thoughts, the Character that <HI>Cicero</HI> gave <HI>Cras|sus,</HI> viz. <HI>Vir non unus &eacute; multis, sed unus inter omnes, prop&egrave; sin|gularis</HI>: And I desire here to own my beholdingness to his

communicative Disposition, for assisting me with quotations and his Judgment when I have occasion to Crave his Aid there|in, as you know I have late|ly done; and shall be glad that the learning in such Let|ters as I have received from him, wherein there are many excellent Notions, which I had no occasion to quote, may sometime see the light.</P>
<P>But I am in the next place with Justice, to acknowledge it to you, that you have in your <HI>Reflections</HI> on the <HI>Vsurpations</HI> of the <HI>late</HI> times, acquainted the World with several things use|ful to be inserted in the <HI>History</HI> of that <HI>Age,</HI> and could wish that such a <HI>Writer</HI> as your self, would undertake the writing of it.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="29">Nor can I forbear to observe, that your occasional propping up the great <HI>Characters</HI> of ma|ny of his Majesties <HI>Ministers</HI> in your <HI>Discourse,</HI> in very warm <HI>Conjuncture,</HI> when a <HI>Factious</HI> Multitude was so busy in De|molishing their Reputations, was worthy your great thoughts and generosity: And your par|ticular painting the <HI>Character</HI> of the late <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Clarendon</HI> in such Noble <HI>Colours</HI> (and with Somewhat as <HI>bold</HI> strokes too of your Fancy and Judgment, as <HI>Aerodius</HI> shew'd in his penne's <HI>Nulling</HI> the <HI>Laws</HI> made above a thousand years ago, against the <HI>Heroical</HI> Men you have menti|on'd) was in you an adventu|rous piece of Justice.

several persons <HI>off</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Stage, whom you mention'd as then living, and particular|ly the late Duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> of whom in <HI>p.</HI> 174. of your <HI>Dis|course</HI> you speak as one of the <HI>three Earls</HI> then <HI>Living,</HI> who went from the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> to the Roman-Catholick Communion; and whom you since told me, you there intro|duced only with his Title of <HI>Earl</HI> (a Title that was due to him as <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Norwich, Arun|dell</HI> and <HI>Surry</HI>) making bold to Level him with the Title of the other two, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the late <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Bristoll,</HI> and the late <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Inchiqueen,</HI> as intend|ing thereby, that if he had liv|ed to have read your <HI>Discourse,</HI> (of which you told me, you

communicated several parts to him) he might by that little Obscurity, see the Reverence you had paid to that picture of your known great <HI>Friend,</HI> by your drawing a <HI>Curtain</HI> before it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Radnor,</HI> and the late <HI>Lord Keeper North,</HI> whose Characters you have so greatly painted to Eternity, left the World, without seeing the right that you had so gene|rously done them in <HI>Defiance</HI> of the vulgar Clamour.</P>
<P>I am moreover here to own my thanks to you, for giving me occasion by your so fre|quent <HI>quoting</HI> of D' <HI>Ossat,</HI> to re|new my Conversation in my <HI>Library,</HI> with that great Author.</P>
<P>His Excellent <HI>Letters</HI> were
<PB N="25" REF="30">
formerly fresh enough in my Memory; and time was here|tofore, when not to be well <HI>versed</HI> in him, was a Reproach to a Man employed in <HI>Affairs</HI> of the <HI>State,</HI> as you will see by my <HI>Lord Falkeland</HI> the <HI>Se|cretary</HI> of <HI>State</HI>'s printed <HI>Let|ter,</HI> in <HI>answer</HI> to Mr. <HI>Walter Montagues</HI> Letter, where speak|ing of <HI>D' Ossat,</HI> he adds, viz. <HI>An Author which, I know, Mr.</HI> Montague <HI>hath read; because whosoever hath but considered State Matters, must be as well skill'd in him, as any Priest in his breviary.</HI></P>
<P>You very well in <HI>p.</HI> 38. ob|serv'd how one <HI>Priest,</HI> that in his <HI>Book</HI> considered <HI>State Mat|ters</HI> and quoting <HI>D' Ossat</HI> about the same, was not so well
<PB N="26" REF="31">
skilled in him, as in his <HI>Brevi|ary</HI>; I mean, Mr. <HI>Browne</HI> the <HI>Franciscan,</HI> who in his <HI>ADVO|CATE of Conscience Liberty,</HI> Cited <HI>D' OSSATS Letter,</HI> to shew that the <HI>Gunpowder-Trea|son</HI> was <HI>contrived</HI> by <HI>CECIL.</HI></P>
<P>But it was the ill fate of that <HI>Cardinal,</HI> on the account of his great Fame for the <HI>Politicks,</HI> to be falsely <HI>Cited,</HI> and even as to the point of the <HI>Gunpow|der-Treason,</HI> by several who ne|ver read him, and particularly by Mr. <HI>Osborne,</HI> in his <HI>works</HI> bound together, <HI>p.</HI> 487. among the <HI>Memoirs of King</HI> James, where he saith; <HI>And here I cannot omit, that after this hap|py Discovery, his Catholick Ma|jesty sent an Agent, on purpose to Congratulate King</HI> James <HI>his
<PB N="27" REF="31">
great preservation from the Gun|powder-Treason, a flattery so pal|pable, as the Pope could not for|bear Laughing in the face of</HI> Car|dinal D' Ossat, <HI>when he first told it him: Nor he forbear to imform his King of it, as may be found in his printed Letters.</HI></P>
<P>You have truly shewn it out of the <HI>Cardinals</HI> Epitaph, prin|ted in the <HI>Edition</HI> of his <HI>Letters</HI> in <HI>Folio,</HI> that he dyed in the <HI>year</HI> 1604.</P>
<P>I am very glad, that for the Honour of the <HI>Reformation,</HI> you have with so much <HI>Candour,</HI> and likewise with Substantial <HI>Calculation,</HI> Confuted an Un|just insinuation against it, made by the <HI>Author</HI> of the <HI>Compendi|um,</HI> who there in p. 77. saith, <HI>can it be said that the Monarchy
<PB N="28" REF="32">
of</HI> England <HI>hath gotten by the Reformation (and what desperate Enemies that hath created, us may be easily imagined) that no|thing but</HI> Popery, <HI>or at least its</HI> Principles, <HI>can make it again emerge or lasting.</HI></P>
<P>It was fit that the clearing of the truth in that matter, should be undertaken by some one or other of our <HI>Church</HI>; and it hath been by you very Satis|factorily performed: And your thus Confuting that <HI>Author,</HI> without naming him or his <HI>Book</HI> in that part of your <HI>Dis|course,</HI> where you were doing it, was the more Congruous to the measures of Charity and <HI>Candour</HI>; and the more for the advantage of your underta|king.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="32">It was likewise fit, that the minds of so many People, whose Humour in the late Fermentati|on was <HI>desperare de Republic&acirc;,</HI> should be fortified with Reason: And that the popular <HI>Nusance</HI> of <HI>FEARS AND IEALOV|SIES</HI> should be removed, and which you have so much <HI>ex pro|fesso</HI> (I think) beyond any of our late Writers done.</P>
<P>And while the <HI>vulgus</HI> of <HI>Wri|ters</HI> were entailing <HI>Fears</HI> and <HI>Iealousies</HI> upon us; your <HI>predict|ing,</HI> from <HI>Natural</HI> Causes, the Happy <HI>Future STATE</HI> of your <HI>Country</HI>; and that the <HI>Fermen|tation</HI> would be <HI>perfective</HI> to it, (as your words are) was an Attempt of a great <HI>Genius.</HI></P>
<P>And I cannot but in Justice say to you, that your thoughts
<PB N="30" REF="33">
in <HI>p.</HI> 194, 195. of the Folly and Madness of any <HI>Republican</HI> Mo|dellers here, are <HI>new</HI> and <HI>great.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, as I always had a Just and High value and Ho|nour for the Endowments of his Present Majesty, that were in him <HI>Conspicuous</HI> to the World, when <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>York</HI>; and was as much ashamed of the oppro|brious <HI>Calumnies,</HI> that his <HI>great</HI> Character was then exposed to, as any Man whatsoever; (and was likewise more con|cern'd for the ill usage he had, than for my own, when my poor Name was in the printed <HI>Affidavit,</HI> enforced to March round the Kingdom with his Great and Illustrious one;) so I was glad that in the late Con|juncture, I found by some prin|ted
<PB N="31" REF="33">
<HI>Sheets</HI> of your <HI>Discourse</HI> then sent me, your papers Re|presentation of his <HI>Character</HI> made him amends for the <HI>San|benito</HI> of the <HI>Affidavit.</HI></P>
<P>And the <HI>Strictures</HI> of your great <HI>Fancy</HI> and <HI>Iudgment,</HI> with which you so apparently refer to his Character in <HI>p.</HI> 122.176.211.271. and others in your <HI>Casuistical Discussion,</HI> tho' they were but short, and seemingly <HI>en passant,</HI> yet they were like the <HI>slanting</HI> of Lightning, and like glances, whose quick Move|ments, might probably Create much more powerful Passions of <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Admiration</HI> in a <HI>Reader</HI>; than if you had <HI>pen|ned</HI> his Character in <HI>Set</HI> formal <HI>Panegyricks,</HI> whose Hony soon cloys, and leaves no sting or

Impression in the Mind.</P>
<P>But that which I may para|lel, with any <HI>Coup de Maitre</HI> in your, or perhaps any Discourse, and Writ with such great Ad|vantage for his present <HI>Maje|sties</HI> Service; and wherein the Mixtures of your great Co|lours is so Admirable, and wherin you have painted accor|ding to the height of a <HI>pittore,</HI> that the <HI>Italians</HI> say, must paint <HI>con diligenza &amp; con amore &amp; con fortuna,</HI> is what I find in your <HI>page</HI> 217, and 218. For 'tis there, that in your great pi|cture of His <HI>Late</HI> Majesty as an <HI>Agonist,</HI> and laying the <HI>Crown of Righteousness</HI> before him, <HI>eo no|mine,</HI> and as <HI>Contending</HI> for the <HI>Succession</HI>; You have inter|weaved the <HI>picture</HI> of your own

<HI>Loyalty</HI> and <HI>Contention</HI> for it, with such <HI>bold</HI> Touches, as I shall not name; but <HI>refer</HI> the <HI>Reader</HI> to them, which it was pitty but your <HI>Index</HI> had done, with a <HI>hand</HI> in the <HI>Margent.</HI></P>
<P>There is no doubt; but the very <HI>Curiosity</HI> of the <HI>Calculati|ons</HI> in your <HI>Discourse,</HI> would have brought it into the <HI>late</HI> Kings <HI>Cabinet,</HI> and to his peru|sal, had he lived till its <HI>Publi|cation</HI>; and your great Maje|stick <HI>Insinuations</HI> of perswasive Arguemnt, there brought ap|parently w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">th a Design to fortifie his great Mind against any possible further Batteries from Members of any of the three Estates, to occasion his consenting to the <HI>Exclusion,</HI> must necessarily have been soon

perceiv'd by so quick an Appre|hension as his Majesties; and could not but have made deep <HI>impressions</HI> on him, for the con|tinuance in his former pur|pose.

mentioned, and which was by her so well taken, was not a harder Task to be performed, than what you presented to the consideration of his Late Ma|jesty from the <HI>Press,</HI> in the Af|fair of his preserving the <HI>Line|al</HI> Succession of his present <HI>Majesty.</HI></P>
<P>As it is natural to Men, on the sight of any Combatants or Wrestlers, whom they had never before seen, to wish bet|ter to the one, than the other; and to have their <HI>Fancy's</HI> by the <HI>Current</HI> of <HI>Nature</HI> constantly carryed along, to favour the Fortunes of this or that Con|tender, whom yet they never saw, so I have during the course of our long acquaintance, obser|ved in you on all occasions, a

<PB N="37" REF="36">
Natural cause, in some degree, of Men's being Animated to bring them to effect.</HI></P>
<P>And indeed, I receiving ma|ny of your printed <HI>Sheets,</HI> du|ring our late <HI>Fermentation,</HI> when so many <HI>Writers</HI> seemed <HI>Associ|ated</HI> in the <HI>praediction</HI> of the <HI>worst</HI> of <HI>Events,</HI> under a Popish <HI>Successor,</HI> was the more plea|sed to find one Man that was not like a dead fish carryed down with the <HI>stream</HI> of the <HI>Times,</HI> as to the point of ill <HI>bo|ding</HI> to the <HI>publick</HI>; and the strength of whose <HI>fancy</HI> mixt with his great <HI>Reason</HI> and Judg|ment, might be able to help to turn that <HI>stream.</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>God</HI> be thanked, that by his <HI>Majesties</HI> coming to in|herit the <HI>Throne</HI> of his <HI>Ancestors,</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="37">
with almost as equal <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Ioy</HI> of the <HI>People,</HI> as his <HI>Royal</HI> Brother was Restored to the same, (and for your Descripti|on of the <HI>Figure</HI> I made in which latter, or to speak more properly of my <HI>Duty</HI> I dischar|ged therein, I return you my Just Acknowledgments) and by his so early and voluntary Gra|cious <HI>Declaration,</HI> of his defend|ing the <HI>C.</HI> of <HI>E.</HI> and the Civil Go|vernment, as by <HI>Law</HI> Established; and so publickly owning the Loyalty of the Principles of that <HI>Church,</HI> and by his conti|nuance of the <HI>prosperity</HI> of that Church, and the <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Prosperity</HI> of the <HI>Kingdom,</HI> while <HI>the whole Creation</HI> (as I may say) <HI>groans</HI> under the pressure of some of our Protestant <HI>Bre|thren</HI>

<P>I am likewise glad hereby, that another Learned Person of our Church, I mean Dr. <HI>Tho|mas Sprat,</HI> the <HI>Lord Bishop</HI> of <HI>Rochester,</HI> taking his view of the Future <HI>State</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> in his <HI>History</HI> of the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> and there saying, as you have Ci|ted it, that <HI>we may safely con|clude, that what ever vicissitude shall happen about Religion in our time, it will probably be neither to the advantage of implicit Faith, nor of Enthusiasm,</HI> has hitherto appear'd so fortunate in that <HI>praediction.</HI></P>
<P><HI>God</HI> be thanked that such as in the late <HI>Conjuncture,</HI> troubled us with the being <HI>Lachrymists</HI> in

<P>We have had presently after the Kings coming to the Throne, a little <HI>Cloud</HI> of Calum|ny cast on the Reputations of four of the most Eminent <HI>Di|vines</HI> of our <HI>Metropolis,</HI> by some of their fellow Subiects, sup|posed Roman Catholicks; but it soon <HI>passed</HI> off: And God
<PB N="41" REF="38">
<HI>brought forth their Righteousness as the Light, and their Iudg|ment as the Noon-Day:</HI> And the thing scarce deserves to be re|membred, that after they had thus <HI>misrepresented</HI> four such Protestant <HI>Divines</HI> with so much falshood, some others of those published a Book, called <HI>The Papist Misrepresented, and Represented,</HI> and which is late|ly answer'd with that Candour and Strength of Reason, that ought to be in <HI>Theological</HI> Wri|tings; and wherein as the Lord <HI>Falkeland</HI> who was then Secre|tary, was wont to say, <HI>it was as absurd to mingle angry reviling expressions, as to do so in a Love-Letter.</HI> There was a despicable Childish <HI>Pamphlet</HI> (and Writ with too much <HI>petulant</HI> inso|lence)

<P>The Book is full of great Learning, and Dedicated to the then <HI>Lord Keeper, Bishop of</HI> Lin|coln:
And there under his third <HI>proposition,</HI> (viz.) the <HI>King is not Subject to any Foreign Iurisdiction,</HI> he tells us in p. 40. <Q>that K. <HI>Henry</HI> the 8th. being at Variance with the Pope, a Parliament was called within two years, and a Motion was made therein, that the King should be declared Head of the

as a most prudent <HI>Solomon,</HI> minding the good of his Sub|jects, over whom God hath placed him; and deeply ponder|ing with himself, how he might make good and wholsom Laws for the Government of his Common-Wealth; and above all things, taking care that nothing be there resolved upon against the <HI>Holy Scrip|tures</HI>; (which he is, and ever will be ready to Defend with Hazard of his Dearest Blood) out of his deep Wisdom, and after great pains taken herea|bouts, hath Transmitted, and sent unto his University of <HI>Oxon,</HI> a certain question to be Disputed, <HI>viz.</HI> whether the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> hath any great|er Jurisdiction granted to him

from God in the Holy Scrip|tures, to be exercised and used in this Kingdom, than any o|ther Foraign Bishop; and hath commanded us, that dis|puting the question, after a di|ligent and mature Delibera|tion and Examination of the premisses, we should certifie his Majesty, under the Common Seal of our University, what is the true meaning of the <HI>Scriptures</HI> in that behalf, accor|ding to our Judgments and Apprehensions.

Submissions, Obediences and Charities, to foreshew the way of Truth and Righteousness, to as many as desire to tread in her steps; and with a good, sure and quiet Conscience, to Anchor themselves upon Gods Word: We could not but endeavour our selves, with all the possible care that we could devise, to satisfie so Just and Reasonable a Request of so great a Prince (who next un|der God, is our most Happy and Supream Moderator and Governor.)

time enough, and many days space to Deliberate thereof di|ligently, religiously, and in the fear of God, with zealous and upright Minds; first searching, and searching again the Book of God, and the best Interpreters thereupon dispu|ting the said questions, So|lemnly and Publickly in our Schools, have in the end, una|nimously, and with joynt consent, resolved upon the Conclusion; that is to say, That the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> hath no greater Jurisdiction given unto him in Scripture, than any other Bishop, in this King|dom of <HI>England</HI>: Which our Assertion, Sentence, or De|termination, so upon delibe|ration maturely and through|ly

And then follows the Transla|tion of the whole in <HI>English</HI>; and which makes about half of that page 338, and wherein the same Judgment for substance is given, with that of the <HI>Ox|ford Rescripts: That the Bishop of</HI> Rome <HI>hath no more State Au|thority and Iurisdiction given him of God in the Scriptures over this Realm of</HI> England, <HI>than any
<PB N="62" REF="52">
other extern Bishop hath.</HI> That <HI>Instrument</HI> hath not there the <HI>Date</HI> of any <HI>Month</HI> to it, as the <HI>Oxford Rescript</HI> hath: But in the Body of the Instrument 'tis mentioned, that the <HI>Iudgment</HI> of <HI>that Vniversity</HI> was therein <HI>required,</HI> though not by whom; and towards the Conclusion of it, 'tis Styled an <HI>Answer, in the Name of that Vniversity</HI>; and 'tis probable, that the <HI>Iudgment</HI> of that <HI>Vniversity</HI> might have been <HI>required</HI> by some of the <HI>Ministers</HI> of King <HI>Henry</HI> 8<HI>th.</HI> and by his Order; whereas the <HI>Oxford Rescript,</HI> mentioned his <HI>Majesties</HI> having <HI>himself</HI> requi|red the <HI>Iudgment</HI> of that <HI>Vni|versity</HI> in that point.</P>
<P>What I have here mentioned of the <HI>Iudgment</HI> of our two <HI>Vni|versities,</HI>
<PB N="63" REF="52">
gives me occasion to take notice of an <HI>Oversight</HI> of my <HI>Lord Herbert,</HI> in this place of his <HI>History,</HI> by me Cited; For he in this <HI>p.</HI> 408. makes <HI>the Vni|versities Determining, that the Pope had no Iurisdiction warran|ted to him by Gods Word in this Kingdom</HI>; whereas he <HI>should</HI> have Represented their <HI>Sense</HI> of his not having <HI>more</HI> here, than any other Foraign Bishop. And thus you truly express the Sense of their Judgment in this Case, when you say <HI>p.</HI> 70<HI>th.</HI> of your Book, that <HI>the Popes Cards were, by the Clergy that plaid his Game, thrown up, as to all claim of more power here by the Word of God, than every other Foraign Bishop had: And both our Vniversities sent their Iudgments about the same
<PB N="64" REF="53">
thing to the K.</HI> which, <HI>methinks, might make our Papists approach a little nearer to us, without any fear of Infection. For we allow the Bishop of</HI> Rome <HI>to have as much power by the Word of God here, as any other Foraign Bishop; and 'tis pity but that the Iudgment of our Vniversities, were shewn the World in Print, and sent to the</HI> French <HI>King; and particularly the Iudgment or Rescript of the Vniversity of</HI> Oxford, <HI>as not be|ing any where in Print as I know of; But in an Old Book of Dr.</HI> James's, <HI>against Popery.</HI></P>
<P>But as to your thought of having that <HI>Rescript</HI> of the <HI>Vni|versity</HI> of <HI>Oxford,</HI> sent to the <HI>French</HI> King; I for my part, am disinclined to it. The printing of it here, may probably bring
<PB N="65" REF="53">
it to the notice of his Ministers, and so perhaps to his. I have heard how the <HI>French</HI> Em|bassador, not long ago ap|plyed to a Learned Friend of ours, of the long Robe, and of the Church of <HI>England</HI>; and one who is a great <HI>Antiquary,</HI> and desired him to furnish him with <HI>Copies</HI> of <HI>Records</HI> not prin|ted in Dr. <HI>Burnets</HI> Works, that related to <HI>Henry</HI> 8<HI>th's</HI>&punc; withstand|ing the <HI>Papal</HI> Usurpation; and no doubt but the <HI>Copy</HI> of this <HI>Oxford Rescript,</HI> would have been as welcom to him, and as necessary to Compleat his Col|lection, as any could have been; and the publication of it, may perhaps be of use in some pla|ces of the Roman Catholick World abroad: But I fear, that
<PB N="66" REF="54">
the present <HI>French</HI> King, will never without some strange un|expected provocation, received from the Papacy, advance so far towards the confines of Re|formation, as <HI>Henry</HI> 8<HI>th.</HI> did. I know it was but Congruous to Worldly Politicks (however contrary to Justice) for <HI>French</HI> Kings formerly to use very high Severities to their Protestant Subjects, in the Conjunctures of their quarrelling with the Pope; and this you well observe in <HI>p.</HI> 329. out of the <HI>Book</HI> cal|led, <HI>the Policy of the Clergy of France</HI>; Namely, that <HI>the French Kings never made any Assaults on the Papal Power; but what cost their Protestant Subjects very dear.</HI> And of the like Nature, were the <HI>Political</HI> Measures of <HI>Henry</HI>

<P>But there is another use we may now well make of the <HI>publication</HI> of this <HI>Rescript</HI> of the <HI>Vniversity</HI> of <HI>Oxon</HI>; and that is to observe how <HI>awkwardly</HI> and <HI>unseasonably</HI> the Author of <HI>The Papist Misrepresented, and Repre|sented,</HI> hath thought fit to Re|present the <HI>Pope</HI> as now dedu|cing a Claim to a Higher Pow|er here by the <HI>Word</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> than what our Roman-Catholick Universities allowed him in <HI>Henry</HI> the 8<HI>th's</HI> time.
For in his 18<HI>th. Chapter,</HI> he tells us, <Q>That the Papist believes, that
<PB N="78" REF="61">
there is a Pastor, Governor, and Head of Christs Church under Christ, to wit the <HI>Pope,</HI> or <HI>Bi|shop</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> who is the Suc|cessor of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> to whom Christ committed the Care of his Flock, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and now be|lieving the Pope to enjoy his Dignity, he looks on him|self obliged to shew him the Respect, Submission and Obe|dience which is due to his place. <HI>And afterward,</HI> in this manner is he ready to behave himself towards his <HI>CHIEF PASTOR,</HI> with all Reverence and Submission, never scru|pling to receive his Decrees and Definitions, such as are issued forth by his Authority, with all their due Circumstan|ces, and according to Law, in
<PB N="79" REF="61">
the concern of the whole Flock,</Q></P>
<P>His <HI>Answerer</HI> doth well reply to him in that point, and with a Candour suitable to the <HI>Paci|fick</HI> State of the <HI>Realm</HI> you have predicted, under any <HI>Prince</HI> of the <HI>Roman-Catholick</HI> Communi|on; say, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>How doth it appear that Christ ever made St. <HI>Peter</HI> Head of the Church, or committed his Flock to him, in contradistinction to the Rest of the Apostles? This is so far from being evident by Scripture, that the Learned Men of their Church, are asha|med of the places commonly produced for it, <HI>&amp;c. And af|terward saith,</HI> 'We need not in|sist on the Proof of this, since the late mentioned Authors of
<PB N="80" REF="62">
the Roman Communion, have taken so great pains not only to prove the <HI>Popes</HI> Supremacy to be an Encroachment and Usurpation in the Church; but that the laying it aside, is ne|cessary to the Peace and Unity of it. And until the Divine Institution of the Papal Su|premacy be proved, it is to no purpose to debate what man|ner of Assistance is promised to the Pope in his Decrees.</Q></P>
<P>It was (I think) an under|taking, that none but a very Sanguine Man, could suppose fesable to engage us to believe in this Age, that the <HI>Pope</HI> was by <HI>Divine</HI> Right, <HI>Head of our</HI> Church under Christ.

have come to nothing.</P>
<P>By what I have heard of the <HI>Doctors</HI> Loyalty, I believe him to be one who with <HI>Effectual Fervent Prayers,</HI> doth Importune Heaven, for his <HI>Majesties</HI> long and prosperous Reign; and doth his Duty of <HI>praising</HI> God for his <HI>Majesties</HI> being so far a <HI>Nursing Father</HI> to the Church of <HI>Eng|land</HI>; And I have that opinion of the largeness of his Christian Charity and Justice, that he is ready to retaliate with the <HI>Re|presenter,</HI> in not <HI>blackning</HI> the whole <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> with the <HI>principles</HI> lately held by some <HI>Iesuits</HI> and others <HI>Casuists</HI> re|ferred to in the <HI>Popes</HI> Decree of <HI>March</HI> 2<HI>d.</HI> 1679. in &sect;. 13, 14, 15. by the 1<HI>st</HI> of which, it is rendred <HI>no Mortal Sin, to be troubled for

be no more just cause to charge any Papist, except the Actors, with the Blood of <HI>Godfrey,</HI> than there was to cast the <HI>odium</HI> of the Execrable Murder of the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> of St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> on any of the Presbyterians, ex|cept the Ruffianly <HI>Actors.</HI></P>
<P>And as to the case of <HI>God|frey,</HI> I remember you told me, <HI>that since your warm aggravations about it in your DISCOVRSE, you were a colder Concurrer with the Iustice of the Nation therein, and that you, thought there was still somwhat of the</HI> Intervallum <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>uncertain, or <GAP DESC="foreign">, fabu|lous, in the case of his Death.</HI></P>

from thinking there MAY BE something; they will think it is very LIKELY there is something; and from LIKELY THERE IS, they will conclude THERE IS, surely there is some PLOT working</HI>; hath still since inclined me to be <HI>cautious,</HI> how in my most private thoughts I charged any Men, and especially, any great Bodies of Men, with <HI>PLOTS:</HI></P>

<P>But since the <HI>Author</HI> hath in this <HI>case,</HI> thought fit to <HI>invite</HI> us to a <HI>view</HI> of the <HI>Principles APPROVED,</HI> and <HI>Conform to the Religion taught by his Church,</HI> I

<Q>I cannot but say, that though no <HI>Tenet</HI> of their whole Church (which I know) makes at all against it; yet there are prevailing opinions of that side, which are not fit to make good Subjects, when their Kings and they are of different perswasions; <HI>and

having quoted D'</HI> Ossat, for say|ing, that it is the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Maxim, that Faith is not to be kept with Hereticks, and more, that the Pope intimated as much in a Discourse, inten|ded to perswade the King of <HI>France</HI> to forsake the Queen of <HI>England</HI>; and that they hold at <HI>Rome,</HI> that the Pope to avoid a probable Danger of the en|creasing of Heresy, may take away a Territory from the true owner, and dispose of it to another; and many also defend, that he hath power to Depose an Heretical Prince, and of Heresy, he makes him|self the Judge:</Q> <HI>His Lordship with a profound Charity and Iudg|ment, thus goeth on, viz.</HI>
<Q>So that though I had rather my
<PB N="108" REF="76">
Tongue should cleave to the Roof of my Mouth, than that I should deny that a Papist may be a good Subject, even to a King, whom he accounts an Heretick; since I verily be|lieve, that I my self know very many very good: Yet Popery is like to an ill Air, wherein, though many keep their Healths, yet many are Infect|ed, (so that at most, they are good Subjects; but during the Popes pleasure) and the rest are in more danger, than if they were out of it.</Q></P>
<P>Moreover, as to the <HI>firing</HI> of <HI>London</HI>; which the <HI>Author</HI> referreth to, in his <HI>Papist Mis|represented,</HI> as well as the <HI>Death</HI> of <HI>Godfrey,</HI> I was always as careful as you were, to charge

no more Papists with the <HI>Odium</HI> of it, than such as the Justice of the Nation Criminated therewith.

<HEAD>Question the <HI>24th.</HI></HEAD>
<P>In the 24<HI>th.</HI> place, I en|quire whether a whole City may be burn'd, or otherwise destroyed, in which are some Hereticks? And the gloss on the Canon, <HI>Si audieris,</HI> argues, that 'tis so by the Text. And <HI>Iohannes</HI> &amp; <HI>Laurentius,</HI> seem to be of opinion that any Person whatsoever, may do it. But other Authorities are brought for the contrary, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And <HI>Archidiaconus</HI> saith, that the Church doth grant the general power of Exter|minating Hereticks. And by the Authorities Cited, the pow|er
<PB N="131" REF="87">
for so doing, is not only directed to Princes: And like|wise, the Indulgence is gran|ted to the <HI>Cruce signati,</HI> for the exterminating Hereticks: But as to the killing and despoil|ing of such, it is safe, that it be done by the Edict of the Prince, or the Church: Lest any should seem to fight ra|ther out of Lust or Revenge, than out of Justice or Obedi|ence, the which <HI>Raynerius</HI> doth also assert, and likewise <HI>Gof|fredus</HI> and <HI>Hostiensis. Iohan|nes Andreas,</HI> goes in the same Track, who subjoyns, that the Declaration of a Judg on the Crime of Heresie, ought ne|cessarily to precede to the ef|fect, that execution be so done. But those things seem
<PB N="132" REF="88">
to me (under favour) to be too crudely and indigestly spo|ken: And in so great a que|stion, where the danger of so many is treated of, and es|pecially, where the innocent are punished for the guilty, the Subject is to be Writ of more gravely, and more pro|foundly; and ones pen was to have been more temper'd. Wherefore I would say, that though some of a City are Hereticks, yet while the City it self hath not incurr'd the guilt of Heresie, and so that that Crime cannot be ascribed to the Body of the City, it may not therefore be burn'd, or otherwise destroyed; For this is not found ordered by any Law. Nay, the Laws are evi|dent
<PB N="133" REF="88">
to the contrary; Name|ly, that Sins ought only to reach to their Authors.</P>
<P>To the Laws that are brought to the contrary, the Answer is clear, and to the Canon, <HI>Si audieris,</HI> by which the gloss doth found it self, much may be said: As first, that that was a Precept of the Old Judicial Law, as appears clearly. For 'tis found in the 13<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>Deuteronomy</HI> And commands of that kind ceased to oblige under the new Law, unless the institution thereof, had been renewed. Nor do we read of any such new In|stitution: For <HI>Cyprian,</HI> to whom that Text in the <HI>Decrets</HI> is ascribed, had not the pow|er of issuing out the General
<PB N="134" REF="89">
Laws (for as much, as he was not Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI>) nor es|pecially in a Case, wherein or|der is given concerning Burn|ing, and Death; as appears in the Text, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Or otherwise you may say, that, that Text doth not speak of Hereticks, but of Idolaters; and those Crimes are different, as appears out of what hath been before said.</P>
<P>And again, otherwise it may be said, that it speaks so, when all Persons of a City were infected with that Crime. And if they were not all in|fected, yet that was lawful at that time, while there was a Command of God for it, who is the Lord of Life and Death; and for which, there
<PB N="135" REF="89">
is a good Text, where menti|on is made of <HI>Sampson</HI>'s Ho|micide. But to the other Laws which <HI>Archidiaconus</HI> ur|geth, 'tis answered, that those things were done by Gods Authority, who did inwardly inspire the Authority of kil|ling, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and it is to be said, that he speaks, when these things were done by the Au|thority of the Judge, as ap|pears in the end of the Text, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And as to somewhat else Cited, you may say, that 'tis understood, when in a lawful Case, War was waged against them; and there was added also to that the Authority of a Superior, who could grant it: Otherwise this Absurdity
<PB N="136" REF="90">
would follow; that for an Act unlawful, and disallowed, the Pope might grant Indulgen|ces; which are only to be granted for a work of Chari|ty: According to what is na|med by the Doctors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and for which the Text makes, for as much as Saint <HI>Thomas</HI> holds out of the same 4. <HI>Sen|tentiarum. distinc.</HI> 20.</P>
<P>The Result of the whole, will rest here, that if a City doth fall into Heresie, then it may be burn'd and destroy'd, and not otherwise.</P>
<P><HI>Bartolus</HI> Confirms this Re|solution in the Case of Heresie, and of Treason, and in all o|ther Cases where the Son is punished for the offence of the Father. And thus it was done
<PB N="137" REF="90">
in the Case of <HI>Carthage,</HI> which for its Rebellion, was plough|ed up, as appears in the <HI>Pan|dects.</HI> He saith likewise, that he saw the Definitive Sen|tence of <HI>Henry</HI> the Emperor, which he gave against the City of <HI>Brixia,</HI> that Rebelled against him, wherein he men|tioned, that the City was to be ploughed up: The which punishment he afterward out of his Mercy released, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And thus <HI>Boniface</HI> did, who by reason of the faults of some of the Templars, destroy|ed their whole order, because they were Hereticks.</P>
<P>But none inferior to a Prince, can give this Sentence, nor can it be done, without the Au|thority of a Prince, according
<PB N="138" REF="91">
to what <HI>Bartolus</HI> doth at large pursue.
<HI>And</HI> Salycet <HI>was of the same Opinion.</HI></P>
<P>But when shall we say, that a City commits Heresie, so that it may be punished in the manner aforesaid?</P>
<P>I Answer, then, if they were all Hereticks, or the Ma|jor part: And it is requisite that they should meet toge|ther as a Community to com|mit this Crime; Namely, by joynt Councels. Otherwise single Persons would be said to do it and not the Commu|nity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Nor would I have you believe by this, that the Innocent are punished with Corporal Punishment for the guilty, which appears mani|festly from what is said by <HI>Bartolus, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="91">
But accrding to the premis|ses, the question is, Whether the Community being punish|ed for Heresie, every single Person be deem'd to be pun|ished so, as that he may be judged to be severally punish|ed for it; and so ought not to be punished further?</P>
<P>To this I Answer, that Per|sons singly, may neverthe|less be punished, if they are found guilty of this Crime; because what the Communi|ty doth owe, Persons do not singly, and so on the contra|ry, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For this Decision, those things do serve, that are noted by <HI>Ioannes</HI> and the Moderns, and by <HI>Barto|lus.</HI></P>

<P>If any one would know
<PB N="140" REF="92">
what figure <HI>Gundissalvus</HI> makes in the account of the Learned <HI>Papal</HI> World, you may tell him, that I suppose that <HI>Tra|ctate</HI> of his against <HI>Heretical</HI> pravity, was Printed long be|fore it was bound up with the <HI>Tractatus Criminales,</HI> before mentioned: For that by one whom I Employed to Consult the <HI>TRACTATES</HI> in 17 <HI>Volums,</HI> in the Edition of <HI>Lions,</HI> in the <HI>Year</HI> 1544. I am informed, that, that Work of <HI>Gundissalvus,</HI> is there in the Second <HI>Volume, fol.</HI> 267. (the which alone, would shew him to be a considerable <HI>Author</HI>) and in the course of my Cursory View of some <HI>Ci|vil</HI> Law Books writ of matters of State, I have read him res|pectfully cited by <HI>Magerus de
<PB N="141" REF="92">
Advocati&acirc; Armat&acirc;,</HI> cap. 8. and p. 205. and by <HI>Klockius</HI> in his <HI>Book De Contributionibus.</HI> And as an Indication of his not being va|lued as a singular or Heterodox Author by <HI>Passerus,</HI> who pub|lished the <HI>Criminal Tractates</HI> a|foresaid, you may find som|what of the Famous <HI>Boerius</HI> his <HI>Tractatus de Seditiosis,</HI> publish|ed in the same Volume, <HI>viz. char.</HI> 57. <HI>n</HI> 18. asserted to the same purpose.</P>
<P>But none need wonder at <HI>Gundissalvus,</HI> giving his opini|on as he did, when he tells us, that <HI>Iohannes Andreas,</HI> and <HI>Lau|rentius,</HI> two Famous <HI>Canonists,</HI> seemed to be of opinion, that an Heretical City, might be de|stroyed by any one; and with|out the Judgment of the
<PB N="142" REF="93">
Church, particularly ordering it.</P>
<P>Yet here in this place, I have Cited out of <HI>Gundissalvus,</HI> it is worthy of observation, that some passages may render him appearing no <HI>Slave</HI> to <HI>Impli|cit</HI> Faith, or one as I may say that roweth in the <HI>Popes</HI> Galleys. His Judging of the Case, as he did with so much <HI>Horror,</HI> was very Commendable in him; as was likewise his reproof of the <HI>Cannonists</HI> by him <HI>Cited</HI>; and his saying that <HI>ones pen was to have been more tempered,</HI> and his differing from the measures of the <HI>Text</HI> and <HI>Gloss</HI> about the Canon <HI>Si audieris,</HI> and the In|terpretation of the 13<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>Deu|teronomy</HI> and answering the ob|jection thence taken, and from
<PB N="143" REF="93">
the Authority of <HI>Cyprian,</HI> seems to have in it something of the <HI>Noble Berean.</HI> But after all he doth in reality shew himself an arrant <HI>Canonist,</HI> and with other <HI>Canonists</HI> by him cited, he founds the <HI>Papal</HI> power of de|stroying <HI>Heretical</HI> Cities, on the <HI>Popes</HI> being a kind of <HI>Prince</HI> or fifth Monarch over the World, and on Heresie being a rebellion against him: And that where the <HI>Major</HI> part of a City are <HI>Hereticks,</HI> the most mode|rate of the <HI>Canonists</HI> think the destruction of it is lawful, if there be the Judgment of the <HI>Church,</HI> that is to say, of the <HI>Pope</HI> in the case, as any could think the Destroying of a City, where the <HI>Majority</HI> were <HI>Rebels</HI> when decree'd by a <HI>Soveraign Prince.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="94">No doubt but to all <HI>Loyal</HI> Roman Catholicks who are willing on all occasions to testify their <HI>Loyalty</HI> by the oppo|sing that <HI>Irreligionary</HI> part of <HI>Popery</HI> (as you call it) which re|fers to the <HI>Vsurpations</HI> of the <HI>Papaute,</HI> and to its pretended Universal <HI>Monarchy,</HI> the Pub|lishing of this or any <HI>Tenet</HI> that sheweth the <HI>Absurdity</HI> of the Popes claiming such a <HI>Power</HI> cannot be unwelcom. And as you have well urged it that the <HI>Canon</HI> Law was never in <HI>Gross</HI> received in <HI>Eng.</HI> in the time of our <HI>Roman Catholick</HI> Ancestors, so it would be a vain expence of time to shew that this parti|cular Canon, <HI>Si Audieris,</HI> never was, and that <HI>Malicious</HI> and Voluntary <HI>Burning of Houses</HI>
<PB N="145" REF="94">
being an Hostile Action, is presumed in our <HI>Law</HI> to be done for <HI>Revenge,</HI> and as by an <HI>Enemy,</HI> to Consume the same by <HI>Fire,</HI> in time of <HI>Peace.</HI> Any such <HI>For|aign</HI> power would by our <HI>Roman Catholick</HI> ancestors have been Presently Adjudged to come under the <HI>Notion</HI> of what I before referred to, as <HI>Ignis Alienus,</HI> and of outraging our Country <HI>Modo guerrino</HI>; and the very claim thereof in the <HI>Canon</HI> Law cannot but make all considerate and Loyal Roman Catholicks startle at the thought of the Extravagance of the former papal <HI>Vsurpations</HI> in the world abroad.</P>
<P>But you have from <HI>p.</HI> 259. to 265. with so much <HI>Candour</HI> and Fairness, discoursed of this
<PB N="146" REF="95">
Savage <HI>Tenet</HI> in the <HI>Canon</HI> Law, that you have saved any one else much of his Labour in do|ing it; and I could wish, that all Writers of Religionary <HI>Con|troversie,</HI> would proceed by such your Measures of <HI>thinking them|selves Morally obliged, to say all that the matter will fairly bear on both sides.</HI> And I accord with you, in Judging any wri|ter to be a kind of <HI>Falsarius,</HI> who doth not so: And am glad that you having so Justly branded that poor partial way of Writing, wherein too ma|ny Protestant, as well as Popish Authors, have appeared so defe|ctive, you have afforded the Age so fair a <HI>Specimen</HI> of Writing with Morality about a <HI>Tenet</HI> very unmoral, and in so Cool
<PB N="147" REF="95">
and Dispassionate a manner of a <HI>Tenet</HI> so fiery.</P>
<P>I am not now to tell you, what you have so long known of me, <HI>viz.</HI> That I never was a Lover of the <HI>Canon</HI> Law: And that though I always had a great Honour for the Princi|ples of <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Reason,</HI> ap|pearing in the <HI>Civil</HI> Law, yet as I never thought better of the <HI>Canon</HI> Law, than <HI>Albericus Gen|tilis</HI> did in his 9<HI>th. Chapter,</HI> and Second Book, <HI>De Nuptijs,</HI> where he saith, <HI>sed hoc jus brutum &amp; barbarum san&egrave; est, natum in tene|bris Saeculorum Spississimis, pro|ductum a Monacho, Tenebrione,</HI> &amp;c. So my finding particularly <HI>Cyprian</HI> so miserably abused in the <HI>Canon</HI> of <HI>Si audieris,</HI> hath made me the more to <HI>Nauseate</HI>
<PB N="148" REF="96">
it. For it is evident, that the place in <HI>Cyprian,</HI> doth not prove what <HI>Gratian</HI> proposeth, <HI>viz.</HI> That a whole <HI>City</HI> now under the <HI>Gospel,</HI> may be burned for a few <HI>Hereticks</HI> inhabiting in it.</P>
<P>'Tis plain, that <HI>Cyprian's</HI> de|sign there is to encourage all good Christians, rather to suf|fer Martyrdom, than to com|mit Idolatry, by Worshipping <HI>other</HI> Gods; that being the <HI>Ti|tle</HI> and <HI>Subject</HI> of the <HI>Epistle, De exhortatione Martyrij</HI>; and in order to this, he shews Gods great Hatred, and severe punish|ing of Idolatry, Namely, from <HI>Deut.</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">.6. (the which making nothing for that <HI>Monks</HI> pur|pose, he wisely leaveth it out of his <HI>Canon</HI>) and from <HI>v.</HI> 12<HI>th.</HI> and
<PB N="149" REF="96">
13<HI>th.</HI> of that <HI>Chapter,</HI> viz. <HI>If thou shalt hear say in one of thy Cities, which the Lord thy God hath given thee to dwell there, certain Men, the Children of</HI> Be|lial, <HI>are gone from among you, and have withdrawn the Inhabi|tants of their City, saying, let us go and serve other Gods,</HI> &amp;c. 'Tis therefore plain, that this severe Law&punc; concerned only the <HI>Cities</HI> of <HI>Israel</HI>; the words in that <HI>Text</HI> being <HI>One of THY Cities, which the Lord thy God hath Given THEE.</HI> And as the <HI>Law</HI> under that penalty, was given only to the <HI>Iews</HI> in <HI>Cana|an,</HI> so it obliged them only, and not any other People of any other Country. Moreover as to the Words in the <HI>Text,</HI> viz. <HI>withdraw the Inhabitants of their
<PB N="150" REF="97">
City, and which Gratian</HI> thought fit to leave out, they may be said to be Indefinite, and may mean all the Inhabitants: And then it was evidently Just, to kill them all, according to the words in <HI>Cyprian, Etiam si uni|versa Civitas consenserit ad ido|lolatriam.</HI> But if the <HI>Major</HI> part be not indeed meant then, if you will consult <HI>Ainsworths</HI> ex|cellent Commentary, on <HI>Deut.</HI> 13. <HI>v.</HI> 12, 13. you will find, that the <HI>Doctors</HI> among the <HI>Iews,</HI> say, that if a <HI>Major</HI> part of the Ci|ty be drawn to Idolatry, then that <HI>Major</HI> part shall be slain, and the City be burned. But if the <HI>Minor</HI> part only be drawn to Idolatry, then they say, that <HI>Minor</HI> part shall be Slain; but the City shall not be burnt. This
<PB N="151" REF="97">
the <HI>Iewish</HI> Doctors, who un|derstood that <HI>Text,</HI> much bet|ter than <HI>Gratian</HI> or <HI>Iohn Se|meca</HI> his <HI>Glossator,</HI> took to be the meaning of that <HI>Text,</HI> and so likewise many Learned Chri|stians did.</P>
<P><HI>Cyprian</HI> then having shewn how great a Sin <HI>Idolatry</HI> was; and how hateful it was to God, he adds, <HI>Si ante Adventum Chri|sti Circa Deum Colendum &amp; Idola Spernenda haec precepta servata sunt, quanto magis post adventum Christi servanda sunt?</HI> But we know, <HI>Mosaical precepts</HI>&punc; are either <HI>De officijs,</HI> or <HI>de poenis.</HI> And as to the former, namely, <HI>Moral</HI> Offices, or <HI>Duty</HI> to <HI>God,</HI> and our <HI>Neighbour</HI>; Of precepts for these <HI>Cyprian</HI> says, that if they were observed before <HI>Christ,</HI>
<PB N="152" REF="98">
then <HI>quant&ograve; magis post adventum Christi,</HI> &amp;c. who had in his <HI>Sermon</HI> on the <HI>Mount,</HI> fully ex|plained, and given us the true meaning of them. And the clearer understanding of any Laws, doth certainly in|duce a stronger Obligation from them: And hence it is, that <HI>Cyprian</HI> thinks truly that Christians are more <HI>strictly</HI> ob|liged to observe the <HI>Moral</HI> Law, than the <HI>Iews</HI> were. But the Laws <HI>de paenis &amp; supplicijs, Cy|prian</HI> doth not at all mention, nor in that place intend or mean. For Christians are not bound to inflict the same punishments on the Transgressours of the Law, to which the <HI>Iews</HI> by the <HI>Mosaical</HI> Law were bound. For to the <HI>Iews</HI> Adultery, or breach
<PB N="153" REF="98">
of the Sabbath, were <HI>Capital</HI> Crimes: But not so among the Christians. Theft was not Ca|pital by <HI>Moses</HI> his Law: Yet by the Law of <HI>England</HI> it is. By the <HI>Iews</HI> Law, it was <HI>an Eye for an Eye, and a Tooth for a Tooth</HI>; but our Blessed Lord declares against that severity, as not to be used amongst <HI>Chri|stians.</HI> And yet our <HI>Monarchus Tenebrio,</HI> would have <HI>Cyprian</HI> understood <HI>de poenis</HI>; and against Truth and the Sense of <HI>Cyprian</HI> concludes, that because <HI>Idola|try</HI> was by the <HI>Iews</HI> Law pun|ished with Death, therefore it should be so punished, since <HI>Christ,</HI> under the Gospel.</P>
<P><HI>Gratian</HI> ends his Quotation out of <HI>Cyprian,</HI> with these words, viz. <HI>Si ante adventum Christi
<PB N="154" REF="99">
haec praecepta servata sunt quan|to magis post adventum servanda sunt, quando ille veniens non verbis tantum nos hortatus est, sed &amp; factis?</HI> By which words he would prove, that our Lord did both by <HI>Words</HI> and <HI>Deeds,</HI> exhort us to <HI>Kill</HI> Hereticks: Whereas there is not one word in <HI>Cyprian,</HI> or the <HI>Texts</HI> of Scrip|ture he Cites, which any way concerns <HI>Hereticks</HI> or <HI>Heresie</HI>; but only <HI>Idolaters</HI> and <HI>Idolatry,</HI> which are things of a far diffe|rent Nature. And had <HI>Grati|an</HI> considered what immediate|ly follows there in <HI>Cyprian</HI> (and which he there unluckily leaves out) he might have clearly seen that <HI>Cyprian</HI> neither said nor meant, that the <HI>Meek</HI> and the <HI>Holy Iesus,</HI> did, by <HI>Deeds</HI> or
<PB N="155" REF="99">
<HI>Words,</HI> Exhort Men to kill <HI>He|reticks.</HI> But that which <HI>Cypri|an</HI> truly saith, our Blessed <HI>Sa|viour</HI> did by <HI>Deeds</HI> and <HI>Words</HI> Exhort us to, was that <HI>Christi|ans</HI> should patiently suffer, and by no means renounce the Gospel by serving Idols, and by Idolatry. For as to those words with which <HI>Gratian</HI> ends his <HI>Ca|non,</HI> viz&punc; <HI>Christus veniens non verbis tantum nos hortatus est, sed factis,</HI> there should have been only a <HI>Comma</HI> after <HI>factis,</HI> though <HI>Gratian</HI> makes a <HI>full</HI> point, as if it <HI>concluded the</HI> Sen|tence. It immediately follows in <HI>Cyprian</HI> thus, viz. <HI>Non ver|bis tantum nos hortatus sit, sed &amp; factis, post omnes Injurias &amp; contumelias passus &amp; Crucifixus, ut nos pati &amp; mori exemplo suo
<PB N="156" REF="100">
doceret, ut nulla sit homini ex|cusatio pro se (pro Christo) non patienti, Cum ille passus sit pro nobis, &amp;c.</HI> In short, that which <HI>Cyprian</HI> saith, Christ taught us with <HI>Words</HI> and <HI>Deeds</HI> was not, that we should <HI>Kill</HI> Hereticks, as <HI>Gratian</HI> would have it; but that we should willingly suffer Death for the Gospel, rather than be Idolaters.</P>
<P>We know that in the case of the <HI>Samaritans</HI> (who were both <HI>Hereticks</HI> and <HI>Idolaters</HI>) when <HI>Iames</HI> and <HI>Iohn</HI> would have had <HI>fire</HI> from <HI>Heaven,</HI> to <HI>Con|sume them,</HI> our Blessed <HI>Saviour</HI> Rebuked them, and said, that <HI>the Son of Man was not come to destroy Mens Lives; but to save them.</HI></P>
<P>Because I love to make no

<P>And there is the Work of ano|ther <HI>French</HI> Historian, that may be here referred to, viz. <HI>Histo|riarum Galliae ab excessu</HI> Hen. 4. <HI>Libri</HI> 18. <HI>Authore</HI> G.

(the year in which <HI>Cressy</HI> out of <HI>Cabassu|tius</HI> says, the <HI>Clergy</HI> received the <HI>Trent</HI> Council) <HI>Proposita &agrave; Clero Concilij Tridentini promul|gatio,

Estate) the issue was, that the third Estate carryed it a|gainst the Clergy; and the Re|ception and Promulgation of the</HI> Trent <HI>Council, was absolutely re|jected,</HI> and (p. 69.) <HI>PRAEVA|LVITQVE CLERO POPV|LVS.</HI></P>
<P>Where it is evident. 1. That what <HI>Cabassutius</HI> in his <HI>Notitia Conciliorum, p.</HI> 720. names only a <HI>Convention</HI> of the <HI>Clergy</HI> in that <HI>year</HI> 1615. (as if that had
<PB N="217" REF="130">
been all) was in Truth, <HI>Con|ventus trium Regni Ordinum,</HI> a Convention of the <HI>three</HI> Estates, the greatest and Supream Con|vention of <HI>France,</HI> and as <HI>Gra|mondus</HI> saith, <HI>p.</HI> 58. 2<HI>dly.</HI> That whereas <HI>Cabassutius</HI> says, the <HI>Trent</HI> Council was received in that General Convention of the <HI>Gallican</HI> Clergy; <HI>De Marca</HI> saith, and evidently proves, that no such <HI>Convention</HI> of the <HI>Gallican Clergy</HI> had any <HI>Authority</HI> to <HI>Receive</HI> or <HI>Promulgate</HI> the <HI>Trent</HI> Council&punc; or any other. <HI>Approve</HI> it they might; but receive it they could not. But it was so far from being <HI>recieved</HI> by the Convention of the <HI>French cler|gy,</HI> that it was absolutely re|jected by the Supream Conven|tion of the <HI>three</HI> Estates, and
<PB N="218" REF="131">
that after a long and free De|bate.</P>
<P>It is true and most Notori|ous, that not only in <HI>France,</HI> but in <HI>England</HI> heretofore, ma|ny of the <HI>Papal</HI> Clergy were generally more addicted to ad|vance the Papal <HI>Power,</HI> than the Just <HI>Prerogatives</HI> of their own Kings, or the Rights of the Laity: Because as by the <HI>Clergy's</HI> help and assistance the <HI>Papacy</HI> grew greater, their Jurisdiction and Revenues were thereby encreased. And thus <HI>Anselme</HI> and <HI>Becket</HI> being zea|lous for the Pope, and Disobe|dient to their King, found their account in the Pope's Assisting and Favouring them with his Power while they lived, and <HI>Canonizing</HI> them, and making
<PB N="219" REF="131">
them (what their Loyalty could not while they lived) Saints af|ter their Death. But as our Magnanimous Roman Catho|lick <HI>Princes</HI> did then bridle the Papal <HI>Power,</HI> so likewise those of <HI>France</HI> have done; and even where <HI>Cabassutius</HI> saith, that the <HI>Trent</HI> Council was <HI>received</HI> in the <HI>year</HI> 1615. <HI>&agrave; Clero Galli|cano sub Ludovico</HI> 13. he doth not say that the <HI>King</HI> received it, and thus <HI>De Marca</HI> tells us in his <HI>De Concordi&acirc; Sacerd. &amp; Imperij.</HI> Lib. 2. Cap. 17. S. 7. p. 33. <HI>Decreta Conciliorum legis vim in Galli&agrave; non habent, nisi recepta &agrave; Clero, &amp; Regi&acirc; Autho|ritate munita.</HI> But <HI>De Marca</HI> had in that <HI>Book</HI> informed us, that in the time the <HI>Trent</HI> Council Sate, when it evidently appear|ed
<PB N="220" REF="132">
by the Decrees of that Councel, the <HI>Liberty</HI> of the <HI>Gallican</HI> Church was <HI>in quam|plurimis apitibus</HI> destroyed, the <HI>Embassadors</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the 2<HI>d.</HI> and <HI>Charles</HI> the 9<HI>th.</HI> left the <HI>Synod,</HI> being called home by their Kings: And had com|plain'd in that Council, that the <HI>Liberty</HI> of the <HI>Gallican</HI> Church, <HI>&amp; Regia dignitas erant immi|nutae</HI>; and their <HI>recesse</HI> from and leaving the <HI>Council</HI> was a good reason, as <HI>De Marca</HI> there proves, <HI>non admittendae Synodi (i. e.)</HI> of their not <HI>receiving</HI> that Council.</P>
<P>Father <HI>Paul</HI> likewise in his <HI>History</HI> of that <HI>Council</HI> saith, that <HI>the French Bishops</HI> left it on the same account.</P>
<P>But moreover <HI>De Marca</HI> in
<PB N="221" REF="132">
the same place tells us, that the whole <HI>Clergy</HI> of <HI>France</HI> did most frequently in their <HI>Sy|nods</HI> Petition their <HI>Kings,</HI> that they would <HI>Publish</HI> and <HI>Recieve</HI> the <HI>Trent</HI> Council (excepting those things which were repug|nant to the <HI>Liberty</HI> of the <HI>Gal|lican</HI> Church) and that they would never grant their <HI>Petiti|on,</HI> nor <HI>Publish</HI> or <HI>Recieve</HI> the <HI>Trent</HI> Council, though with that <HI>Exception.</HI> His words are, <HI>Totius Cleri Gallicani Conventus Con|cilij Tridentini promulgationem &agrave; Re|gibus nostris supplicibus libellis postu|laverit, e&acirc; lege ut ea Capita excipe|rent, quae libertatibus Ecclesiae adversa|rentur: Quorum desiderijs Principes, toto hoc negotio saepe in Consilium prudentissimorum relato, se accommo|dare non potuerunt.</HI> From whence
<PB N="222" REF="133">
it is evident, if that great <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> says true, that the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>France</HI> would never <HI>recieve</HI> any of the <HI>Trent</HI> Council, no not that part of it, which was not against the <HI>Liberty</HI> of their <HI>Church,</HI> or their Kings <HI>Rega|lities.</HI></P>
<P>But after all this, I must not forbear to observe how here it appears, that the Learned <HI>De Marca</HI> doth contradict himself. For in the same <HI>page</HI> and <HI>Co|lumne,</HI> viz. <HI>p.</HI> 133. <HI>Col.</HI> 1. he saith, that the <HI>Definitions</HI> of the <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Trent</HI> concerning <HI>Faith</HI> were admitted in <HI>France</HI> by a publick <HI>Edict, Anno</HI> 1579. (which must be in the 6th. <HI>year</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the 3<HI>d.</HI> of <HI>France</HI>) and yet he tells us in this same <HI>page</HI> and <HI>Columne,</HI> that al|though
<PB N="223" REF="133">
the whole <HI>Clergy</HI> of <HI>France</HI> did most frequently <HI>Pe|tition</HI> their <HI>Kings</HI> to <HI>Promul|gate</HI> and <HI>admit</HI> only that part of the <HI>Trent</HI> Council, which was not against the <HI>Liber|ties</HI> of the <HI>Gallican</HI> Church, yet their <HI>Kings</HI> would never <HI>admit</HI> it. If these words of his mean any thing, I think they must mean the <HI>Definitions</HI> of <HI>Faith,</HI> which <HI>De Marca</HI> saith were re|cieved by the <HI>Edict</HI> 1579. But if their Kings would never ad|mit any of it, though the whole Clergy did Petition them to do it, then was it not admitted by any Publick <HI>Edict</HI> in the <HI>year</HI> 1579.</P>
<P>I remember the Learned <HI>Au|thor</HI> of the <HI>Nouvelles de la Republi|que des letteres,</HI> for the <HI>Month</HI> of
<PB N="224" REF="134">
<HI>March</HI> 1685. there mentioning the <HI>Histoire critique du Vieux Testa|ment par le P. Richard Simon Pr&ecirc;tre de la Congregation de l' Oratoire</HI> of the <HI>New Edition</HI> at <HI>Rotterdam</HI> that <HI>year,</HI> saith that <HI>that New Edition contains a Letter of a Protestant Doctor, who procured the</HI> 5<HI>th. Edition of that Cri|tical History</HI>; and further quotes that <HI>Protestant</HI> Minister for giving an <HI>Answer</HI> to the ordinary <HI>Distincti|on, viz.</HI> that the <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Trent</HI> hath been recieved in <HI>France,</HI> in what concerns <HI>Faith,</HI> but not in matters of <HI>Discipline</HI>; and he speaks of an <HI>Assembly</HI> of the <HI>Clergy</HI> held, which he saith, <HI>Deliberated how to present a Petition to the King, that that Council might be recieved as to what concerns Faith only, and that what|ever deliberation the Prelates made there upon, the Court would not grant
<PB N="225" REF="134">
their Request. And if that Council</HI> (saith he) <HI>hath been received, let them produce us the publication of it, or any Act that shews us that it hath been truly received and publisht; for according to the Rules of Right, a Council cannot</HI> Faire Loy, <HI>if it hath not been published.</HI></P>
<P>But if any one were minded to speak Argumentatively, and shew that the <HI>French</HI> do not now receive the <HI>Trent</HI> Council, no not in <HI>rebus fidei,</HI> he might urge. 1. That the whole <HI>Cler|gy</HI> of <HI>France</HI> in their <HI>Assembly, March</HI> 19. 1682. declared that a <HI>Council</HI> is above the <HI>Pope.</HI> 2. That he hath no Power in <HI>Tem|porals</HI> in any Princes Domini|ons. 3. That he hath no Pow|er to <HI>Depose</HI> Princes. 4. Nor to <HI>Absolve</HI> Subjects from their
<PB N="226" REF="135">
<HI>Oaths</HI> of <HI>Allegiance.</HI> 5. That he is not infallible. And though the <HI>Pope</HI> declared by his <HI>Bull</HI> Dated at <HI>Rome Apr.</HI> 11<HI>th.</HI> 1682. that those <HI>Acts</HI> of theirs were <HI>Null</HI> (the words of <HI>Improbamus, Rescindimus, Cassamus, &amp;c.</HI> being in the <HI>Bull</HI>) yet the <HI>French</HI> King had before in his <HI>Edict</HI> of <HI>March</HI> 23. 1682. Registred in <HI>Parliament,</HI> Ratified and Con|firm'd them all. Nor is it de|niable, that these 5 Propositi|ons, contradict many things in the <HI>Trent</HI> Council, which are setled in it as Doctrinal Points.</P>
<P>And moreover 'tis obvious to any one to observe, that in the <HI>Acts</HI> of the General Assem|bly of the <HI>French</HI> Clergy in the <HI>year</HI> 1685. they <HI>Cite</HI> their new <HI>Trent</HI> Creed <HI>(i. e.) some PART</HI>
<PB N="227" REF="135">
of it: For the last of it they cite, is <HI>p.</HI> 38. of that <HI>Book,</HI> and leave out the <HI>LAST part</HI> of that <HI>Creed,</HI> which is contained in these words, <HI>Caetera item omnia Sacris Canonibus &amp; aecumenicis Concilijs, ac praecipu&egrave; &agrave; Sacro-Sanct&agrave; Tridentin&agrave; Synodo tra|dita, definita &amp; declarata, indubi|tanter recipio ac profiteor, simulque Contraria omnia atque haereses quascun|que ab Ecclesi&acirc; damnatas &amp; rejectas &amp; Anathematizatas, ego pariter rejicio, damno, &amp; Anathematizo.

Ego idem N.
<PB N="228" REF="136">
spondeo, voveo, juro,</HI> &amp;c. These are the words which the <HI>French</HI> Clergy leave out in their <HI>Book</HI> above mentioned, and they knew the Preservation of the <HI>Li|berties</HI> of the <HI>Gallican</HI> Church, obliged them to such omission.</P>
<P>For by this part of the <HI>Trent Creed,</HI> they are bound to be|lieve and profess, <HI>Omnia &agrave; Con|cilio Tridentino tradita, definita, declarata,</HI> and so not matters of Doctrine and <HI>Definitions</HI> of <HI>Faith</HI> only: And 'tis most plain, that the Council intended both matters of <HI>Discipline</HI> and <HI>Do|ctrine.</HI> And in the aforesaid words of the <HI>Trent</HI> Creed, a firm Belief is required to be given, <HI>omnibus in Concilijs oecu|menicis traditis</HI>; and then a long <HI>farewel</HI> to all their <HI>Liber|ties</HI>
<PB N="229" REF="136">
of the <HI>Gallican</HI> Church would ensue, and their <HI>Sanctio Pragmatica,</HI> which is the Au|thentick Comprehension of them is Damned by <HI>Leo</HI> the 10th. <HI>approbante Concilio,</HI> in the General <HI>Lateran</HI> Council.</P>
<P>It may be moreover said, that the words above mentio|ned that the <HI>French Clergy</HI> left out of their Book are a part <HI>Fidei Catholicae extr&agrave; quam non est salus</HI>: and therefore if the <HI>French</HI> do not receive (as it seems they do not) this part of the <HI>Trent</HI> Creed, then it may ve|ry well be doubted, whether they receiv'd the <HI>Definitions</HI> of <HI>Faith</HI> of the <HI>Tridentine</HI> Coun|cil, as <HI>De Marca</HI> would have us believe.</P>
<P>The <HI>Trent</HI> Creed I have re|ferred

to, is at the end of that Council in most of the <HI>Editi|ons</HI> of it; but in the <HI>Edition</HI> at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> which is the best, <HI>viz. Anno</HI> 1633, it is in the <HI>Body</HI> of the <HI>Council. Ses.</HI> 24. <HI>p.</HI> 450, 451.</P>

<P>Monsieur <HI>Iurieu</HI> in his <HI>Hi|storical</HI> Reflections on Councils, and particularly on that of <HI>Trent,</HI> which were Translated into <HI>English,</HI> and Printed in the <HI>year</HI> 1684. Saith that <HI>the</HI> French <HI>Kings their Parliaments and Bishops dislike several things in the Decrees of the Council of</HI> Trent; and mentions as the <HI>Reasons</HI> why the <HI>Council of Trent</HI> is not <HI>received</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> these following. 1.
<Q>That the Coun|cil hath done and suffered many things that suppose and confirm a Superiority of the Pope over Councils. 2. It
<PB N="236" REF="140">
hath confirmed the Papal en|croachments upon ordinary's by exemption of Chapters, and priviledges of Regulars, who are both withdrawn from Episcopal Jurisdiction. 3. That it hath not restored to the Bi|shops, certain Functions ap|pertaining to their Office and taken from them, other|wise than to execute them as delegates of the See of <HI>Rome.</HI> 4. That it hath infringed the priviledges of Bishops, of be|ing Judged by their Metrapo|litan and Bishops of Provin|ces, by permitting a removal of great Causes to <HI>Rome,</HI> and giving Power to the Pope, to Name Commissioners to Judge the Accused Bishop. 5. That it hath declared, that
<PB N="237" REF="140">
neither Princes, Magistrates nor People, are to be consul|ted in Setling and placing of Bishops. 6. That it hath Em|powered Bishops, to proceed in their Jurisdictions by Civil pains, by Imprisonment, and by Seisures of the Temporal|ties. 7. That it hath made Bi|shops the Executors of all Do|nations, for Pious uses. 8. That it hath given them a Superintendency over Hospi|tals, Colledges, and Fraterni|ties, with power of disposing their Goods, notwithstanding that these matters had been al|ways managed by Lay Men. 9. That it hath ordained, that Bps. shall have the examining of all Notaries Royal and Impe|rial, with power to Deprive
<PB N="238" REF="141">
or Suspend, notwithstanding any Opposition or Appeal. 10. That it hath given power to Bishops, with consent of two Members of their Chap|ter, and of two of their Cler|gy, to take and retrench part of the Revenue of the Hos|pitals, and to take away feu|dal Tithes belonging to Lay-Men. 11. That it hath made Bishops the Masters of Foun|dations of Piety, as Churches, Chappels and Hospitals, so as that those who have the Care and Government of them, are obliged to be accountable to the Bishops. 12. That in con|firming Ecclesiastical Exemp|tions, it hath wholy ascribed to the Pope and Spiritual Judges, all power of Judging
<PB N="239" REF="141">
the Causes of Accused Bishops, as if Soveraign Princes had lost the right they had over their Subjects, as soon as they became Ecclesiasticks. 13. That it hath empower'd the Ordina|ries and Judges Ecclesiastick, in Quality of Delegates of the Holy See, to enquire of the Right and Possession of Lay-Patronages; and to quash and annul them, if they were not of great necessity and well founded. 14. That in Prohi|biting Duels, it had declared, that such Emperor or Prince, as should shew favour to Du|els, should therefore be Ex|communicated and Deprived of the Seignory of the place holding of the Church, where the Duel was fought. 15.
<PB N="240" REF="142">
that it hath permitted the Mendicant <HI>Fryars</HI> to possess Im|moveables. 16. That it hath or|dained an Establishment of Judges it calls Apostoles in all Dioceses, with Power to Judge of Spiritual and Ecclesiastical Matters, in prejudice of the Ordinary. 17. That it hath declared, that Matrimonial Causes, are of the Churches Jurisdiction. 18. That it hath enjoyn'd Kings and Princes to leave Ecclesiasticks, the free and entire possession of the ju|risdiction granted them by the Holy Canons, and General Councils, that is to say, usur|ped by the Clergy over the Civil Power. These are the Principal Points Disputed in <HI>France</HI>: These that tend to the
<PB N="241" REF="142">
Diminution of the Authority and Priviledges of Bishops, to enlarge the Roman power, are Rejected by the Bishops: And those that would extend the power of Bishops to the Prejudice of the Civil Autho|rity are Rejected by the Par|liaments. Between both, this Council, as enacting contra|ry to the Rights and Liberties of the <HI>Gallican</HI> Church&punc; was never at all received in <HI>France,</HI> so as to obtain the force of a Law.</Q>
He then shews, that the <HI>Popes</HI> Superiority over <HI>Councils,</HI> is a <HI>point</HI> of <HI>Doctrine,</HI> and was decided in the Council of <HI>Trent</HI>: And yet that the <HI>Gallican</HI> Church <HI>believes</HI> the <HI>contrary.</HI>
<Q>I know it will be said (saith he) that the Council of
<PB N="242" REF="143">
<HI>Trent</HI> hath not decided, that the Pope is Superior to Councils. Men may talk as they please; but things for all that, will continue as they are. It is true, that among the Decrees and Canons of the Council, there is none that saith in express Terms, that the Pope is Superior to Coun|cils, and can be judged by none: But the effect of such Decision is apparent in all the Acts, and through the whole Conduct of this Coun|cil.</Q>
And he afterward saith, that the <HI>Clause</HI> of <HI>proponentibus legatis,</HI> was a plain <HI>Decision</HI> of the Popes <HI>Superiority</HI> over the <HI>Council.</HI></P>

<P>And if we consider how in the 22<HI>d.

<P><PB N="245" REF="144">There was a Book called <HI>a Review of the Council of</HI> Trent, written by a Learned Roman-Catholick, and Printed <HI>A.</HI> 1600. and <HI>Translated</HI> by Dr <HI>Langbain</HI> and Printed at <HI>Oxon</HI> 1638.

<Q>That after the Various Intervals in which the <HI>Dis|course</HI> was Written, it having happened that the <HI>Papists</HI> are to the General Satisfaction of Impartial Judges of Men and things, become as sound a part of this Nation, as they were and are of the <HI>Dutch</HI> States, and as throughout the Discourse you always suppo|sed them Capable of being, and in <HI>p.</HI> 361.</Q>You say,

that your Information of the Temper of the Generality of them, might be what arrived not at my Knowledge, and that therefore you pronounced there|of as you have done.

<PB N="325" REF="185">
good a warrant, as any Subject of the Crown I know, to repre|hend <HI>Mercenary</HI> Loyalty; since on your modest Application to the late <HI>King</HI> upon the impor|tunity of your friends, for a Compensation of your <HI>varicus</HI> Services done him almost ever since his <HI>Restoration,</HI> and the <HI>Re|inbursment</HI> of your <HI>expences</HI> in his Service, and on his <HI>Ministers</HI> by <HI>reference</HI> consulting my Judg|ment about your <HI>Case,</HI> I found several thousands of pounds due to you on that account, and do Judge that you never since ap|ply'd to his late <HI>Majesty,</HI> nor any of his <HI>Ministers</HI> about the same. But one instance more of your <HI>unmercenary</HI> Loyalty I shall not conceal, that I was assured of from a Lord in High Favour
<PB N="326" REF="186">
with his late <HI>Majesty,</HI> Namely, that when in his late <HI>Majesties</HI> Reign, he knowing your Abili|ties to serve the King, did of his own accord offer to you his readiness to move his Majesty to afford you a fair <HI>Pension,</HI> you Over-Modestly requested his Lordship to move no such thing in your behalf, professing to his Lordship that it should be the business of your life, to promote all his Majesties Just Measures in what you could, without any expectation of other reward than what the pleasure of all Actions of Loyalty necessarily included in the doing of them. And to this too I might add, that in the time when the late <HI>Western</HI> Rebellion was most con|siderable, your having with o|ther
<PB N="327" REF="186">
Gentlemen appear'd to his Majesty, as ready at your own expence, to be then in Arms to serve the Crown at an Hours warning, was a further fair ex|ample of your <HI>unmercenary</HI> Loy|alty.</P>

<HI>Protestant</HI> Divines favoured, was in the least designed by you as any <HI>humouring</HI> of a <HI>Project</HI> to <HI>reconcile</HI> Churches, a <HI>project</HI> that you have expressed to be so in|effectual, when some well mean|ing Men had it in their Heads in a <HI>Conjuncture</HI> long ago, and when <HI>Withers</HI> a dull <HI>Poet</HI> of the Age, yet a favorite of the <HI>vulgus,</HI> did in his <HI>Emblems p.</HI> 3 of his <HI>ep. dedicat.</HI> (as you once told me) amuse them with his fancies of the <HI>Vnion</HI> of Religion.</P>
<P>And as you have in your <HI>pre|face</HI> observed it that <HI>the few flo|rid Sheets lately published on the Subject of Toleration, have made no other figure than that of the poor resemblances of flowers extra|cted by Chymical Art out of their ashes, and that a little shaking
<PB N="333" REF="189">
them together in the glass of time, must make them presently fall in pieces,</HI> I have observed likewise, that the perhaps well meant <HI>Vel|leities</HI> or Wishes or little <HI>Essays</HI> of some few private Persons that since his Majesties Reign, amused any by propounding a <HI>Reconciliation</HI> of <HI>Churches,</HI> have appeared but like extracted re|semblances of the <HI>flowers</HI> of pri|vate Mens proposals of that kind in the <HI>Conjuncture</HI> before the <HI>year</HI> 1640; and since his Majesties happy Reign, they have been easily <HI>shaken</HI> in <HI>pie|ces.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Prynne</HI> in his <HI>History of the Tryal of</HI> Arch Bishop <HI>Laud,</HI> in <HI>p.</HI> 191. tells us what a ferment Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> his <HI>Case</HI> made in the <HI>Vniversity</HI> of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> in the
<PB N="334" REF="190">
<HI>year</HI> 1637. who Preaching in St. <HI>Mary's,</HI> and there asserting the necessity of <HI>Auricular Confes|sion,</HI> was by Dr. <HI>Brownrig</HI> the <HI>Vice-Chancellor</HI> enjoyned to <HI>Re|cant</HI> that <HI>Doctrine,</HI> and about which great Heats arose among the <HI>Heads</HI> of <HI>Houses</HI> there.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Sharpness</HI> of the <HI>ca|nons</HI> of 40 against <HI>Popery,</HI> shew|ing the zeal the Arch-bishop ex|pressed in the making of those <HI>Canons,</HI> and of that <HI>Clause</HI> in the <HI>Oath</HI> there for the abjuring <HI>Po|pery,</HI> viz. <HI>and that I will not Sub|ject the Church of</HI> England, <HI>to the Church of</HI> Rome which <HI>Oath</HI> the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> in <HI>his Defence</HI> saith, was <HI>a more strict Oath, than ever was made against Popery in any Age or Church,</HI> may easily Convince the Sagacious, of the
<PB N="335" REF="190">
Church of <HI>Englands</HI> Sense then, about any Project of Reconci|ling the Church of <HI>England</HI> to that of <HI>Rome,</HI> being altogether vain.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> had it seems by long and deep observation found the <HI>project</HI> of the <HI>reconci|ling</HI> of our <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>Romes,</HI> a thing utterly unpracticable; however, as to his having been formerly a <HI>Visionaire</HI> about the possibility of the same I remem|ber I have seen some angry re|flections of <HI>Dr&punc;</HI> Williams <HI>Bish|op of</HI> Lincoln against him, and Writ with that Bishops own Hand in the <HI>Margent</HI> of the <HI>Arch-Bishops Printed Star-Cham|ber Speech,</HI> where over against those passages that seemed to be somewhat <HI>trimming</HI> in <HI>favour</HI> of
<PB N="336" REF="191">
the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> Bishop <HI>Wil|liams</HI> wrote <HI>the nearer you come to the Church of</HI> Rome, <HI>the fur|ther she will fly from your Court|ship and Caresses, and will tell you</HI> that <HI>Rusticus es Corydon, nec mu|nera curat Alexis.</HI></P>
<P>But what thing the <HI>Reconci|lers would be</HI> of <HI>Churches</HI> mean, to themselves is sufficiently plain. As to the <HI>natural</HI> mean|ing of any thing of that nature, I call to mind, that a <HI>Presbyte|rian</HI> Minister speaking to you once of <HI>Comprehension,</HI> and of the <HI>Divines</HI> of his perswasion, and that of the Church of <HI>Eng|land</HI> being that way <HI>Reconci|led,</HI> you told him you wished a <HI>Coalition</HI> of such with the Church of <HI>England</HI> as were for|merly of his Perswasion: But
<PB N="337" REF="191">
that you supposed by his <HI>com|prehension,</HI> he desired to be a <HI>Comprehensor</HI> of some of the <HI>Livings</HI> of the <HI>Divines</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> and that therefore when you found any Divine speak of the Essaying to Reconcile Churches, you naturally thought of those Words in the <HI>Acts</HI> of the <HI>Apo|stles.</HI> C. 17. v. 18. <HI>What will this Babler say</HI>? and <HI>Rendring</HI> the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> there by <HI>Church Robber, Altar Robber,</HI> and <HI>Sa|crilegious</HI> Person as our <HI>Brough|ton</HI> did, and justifying that your Critical Acception of the word out of the Greek <HI>Classick</HI> Authors, viz. <HI>Demosthenes</HI> and <HI>Aristophanes,</HI> whom you had said, you had found Cited for that Sense of the word, at the
<PB N="338" REF="192">
end of <HI>Cloppenburg de Sacrificiis,</HI> and who Citing <HI>Aristophanes</HI> his <HI>Comedy</HI> of <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>aves</HI> where the <HI>Birds</HI> threaten <HI>Iupiter</HI> with a Holy War, shews that by <GAP DESC="foreign"> was meant, <HI>Avis Se|minilega,</HI> and that the <HI>Athe|nians</HI> thought St. <HI>Paul</HI> would despoil the <HI>Altars</HI> of the <HI>Gods</HI> of the Provisions of their Of|ferings: And in <HI>Fine</HI> you said, that such various readings of that word, would certainly meet in any ones being thought <HI>a Babler</HI> by those of the <HI>Reli|gion</HI> Established, if he would <HI>interlope</HI> in their Maintenance.</P>
<P>I doubt not but you have heard of the late Candidate Beyond-Sea, for the <HI>Office</HI> of the <HI>Reconciler</HI> of <HI>Churches,</HI> I mean the <HI>Author</HI> of <HI>TVBA

are sufficiently shewn it out of <HI>Mores</HI> Reports, f. 1.282. that <HI>the Popes Bulls giving Monaste|ries to</HI> Wolsy, <HI>with the consent of the King, and the Surrender of the Priors to</HI> Wolsy, <HI>would not serve the turn: and that nothing but an Act of Parliament would alter the Property.</HI></P>
<P>You have here an instance of our present Foraign <HI>Recon|cilers</HI> of <HI>Churches,</HI> being very poor <HI>Middle Region Men,</HI> in Comparison of <HI>Cassander</HI> and <HI>Antonius de Dominis,</HI> and o|thers; as our late little <HI>Recon|cilers</HI> likewise have been, Compared with the unfortu|nate ones of the Old Con|juncture. The <HI>question</HI> of <HI>what will this Babler say,</HI> is proper|ly
<PB N="344" REF="195">
applicable to them from all Parties.</P>
<P>But one thing I cannot but here observe to you, that as I was very well pleased with your <HI>Design,</HI> that you <HI>Com|municated</HI> to me after you had begun this <HI>long VOY|AGE</HI> of your <HI>THOVGHTS</HI> (as I may call it) and writ the <HI>former</HI> part of your <HI>Dis|course,</HI> namely, that <Q>because in your occasional Conver|sation with People of all sorts, you have found that Mens Fancies were (as you said) Nail'd to <HI>POPERY,</HI> and their Tongues Ty'd up as to any thing but <HI>PO|PERY,</HI> and that they could not go beyond the Tedder
<PB N="345" REF="195">
of that in their Discourse; and that <HI>POPERY's</HI> Mo|nopolizing so much of their Discourse, had been one of its <HI>VSVRPATIONS,</HI> you intended to try to divert them from it, and make them pass <HI>ad au|tres,</HI> by laying before them such various Matters of Cal|culation, relating to their own Country and many places of Christendom, as might give them somewhat beside <HI>POPERY</HI> and <HI>PLOTS</HI> to think and speak of in Company;</Q>
So I am much better pleased with your Performance of that your Curious Enterprize, and do think that your <HI>Book</HI>
<PB N="346" REF="196">
by containing in it so many <HI>MISCELLANEA,</HI> must <HI>eo nomine,</HI> prove highly use|ful to our <HI>English</HI> World in this Conjuncture.</P>
<P>It here occurs to me to <HI>observe</HI> to you, that after an <HI>Erratum</HI> of the <HI>Press</HI> in <HI>Page</HI> 38. of your <HI>Discourse,</HI> Namely, where you referred to P. 325 in the <HI>Advocate of Conscience Liberty,</HI> instead of <HI>Page</HI> 225, you make the last <HI>Letter</HI> of <HI>D'Ossats</HI> to be from <HI>Rome An.</HI> 1596, and I sup|pose you happened to do so, by casting your Eye on the Old Date of the <HI>last</HI> Letter but <HI>one</HI> Printed in the <HI>Volume</HI> of his <HI>Letters</HI> in <HI>Folio</HI> of the <HI>Paris</HI> Edition, <HI>An.</HI> 1625. and
<PB N="347" REF="196">
finding it to be <HI>An.</HI> 1596. But it came not into your Mind then, to observe that the <HI>last</HI> of his <HI>Letters</HI> as they are <HI>Ranged</HI> in <HI>Order,</HI> was the 199<HI>th.</HI> and in the <HI>End</HI> of <HI>Book</HI> 9<HI>th.</HI> and which was to <HI>Ville|roy</HI> from <HI>Rome, March</HI> the 6<HI>th. An.</HI> 1604, and in which <HI>Year</HI> he dy'd, as you right|ly refer to his <HI>Epitaph</HI> to shew. But it seems after that last <HI>Letter</HI> in <HI>Book</HI> 9<HI>th.</HI> of the <HI>Paris</HI> Edition, the <HI>Pub|lisher</HI> saying that he had re|covered some others of his <HI>Letters,</HI> Prints them with|out respect to the <HI>Order</HI> of <HI>time</HI>; and there makes the <HI>Date</HI> of the <HI>last</HI> Letter save <HI>one</HI> in the <HI>Volume,</HI> to be in
<PB N="348" REF="197">
the <HI>Year</HI> 1596. as you have there done.
