<HEAD>PROLOGUE
TO A
Commonwealth of Women,
Spoke by Mr. HAYNES,
Habited like a WHIG, Captain of the
Scyth-men in the West, a Scythe in his
Hand.</HEAD>
<L>FROM the <HI>West,</HI> as Champion in defence of Wit,</L>
<L>I come, to mow the Critticks of the Pit,</L>
<L>Who think we've not improv'd what <HI>Fletcher</HI> Writ.</L>
<L>This Godly Weapon first invented was</L>
<L>By Whigs, to cut down Monarchy like Grass;</L>
<L>But I know better how to use these Tools,</L>
<L>And have reserv'd my Scythe to mow down Fools:</L>
<L>Yet o' my Conscience they wou'd sprout again,</L>
<L>And the <HI>Herculean</HI> Labour were in vain.</L>
<L>The Pit, like <HI>Hydra</HI>'s, still wou'd yield supplies,</L>
<L>From one lop't Block-head, twenty more would rise.</L>
<L>A sort of paltry Critticks yonder sit,</L>
<L>For this destroying Engine not unfit,</L>
<L>Cuckolds were always Enemies to Wit;</L>
<L>For Wit oft draws the Wife to leave her Spouse,</L>
<L>To take a small refreshing bit with us.</L>
<L>Phantastick Tastes how hard it is to please!</L>
<L>Critticks, like Flyes, have several Species.</L>
<L>There's one that just has paid his grutch'd half-Crown,</L>
<L>Cries, Rot the Play, Pox on't, let's cry it down.</L>
<L>The censuring Spark wou'd fain seem Great and Witty,</L>
<L>Yet Whispers Politicks with Orange <HI>Betty;</HI></L>
<L>She cracks his Philberds, whilst he, in her Ear,</L>
<L>Is Fighting o're again the Western War,</L>
<L>Bragging what numbers his sole Arm has kill'd,</L>
<L>Tho' the vain Fop perhaps was ne're i'th' Field.</L>
<L>Thus Worm that snugs in Shell where it was bred,</L>
<L>Is nothing to the Maggot in his head,</L>
<L>For Harmless Insect that those Nuts create</L>
<L>Is nothing to the Maggot of the Pate,</L>
<L>Now such a Fop as this wou'd I be at.</L>
<L>Another to compleat his daily Task,</L>
<L>Fluster'd with Claret, seizes on a Mask,</L>
<L>Hisses the Play, steals off with Punk i'th' dark,</L>
<L>He Damns the Poet, but she Claps the Spark.</L>
<L><PB REF="2" MS="y">
I wonder if the Law cou'd doom one dead,</L>
<L>That now should lop off such a Fellow's Head!</L>
<L>It cannot be found Murther.&mdash;And to share</L>
<L>This dreadful Fate, You Critticks all prepare.</L>
<L>For besides all my Scythians yet unseen,</L>
<L>We've yet a Female Common-wealth within,</L>
<L>Who strongly Arm'd, like Furies venture on,</L>
<L>And if y'approach their Trenches once, y'are gone.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<L>HOW silly 'tis for one, not yet Thirteen,</L>
<L>To hope her first Essay should please you Men:</L>
<L>You cannot taste what such a Creature speaks;</L>
<L>Would she were three years older for your sakes;</L>
<L>Two handfuls taller, a Plump pretty Lass,</L>
<L>I doubt not then my Epilogue would pass.</L>
<L>But, as I am, for your Applause I sue,</L>
<L>Pray spare me for the Good that I may do.</L>
<L>Gallants, I better shall perform e're long,</L>
<L>Despise not a poor thing because she's young.</L>
<L>Twigs may be bent, Trees are too stubborn grown;</L>
<L>And th' Roses Bud is sweet as Roses blown.</L>
<L>In <HI>China</HI> (as I often have been told)</L>
<L>The Women marry at eleven years old:</L>
<L>Our Play-House is a kind of <HI>China</HI> too,</L>
<L>And nothing like the Stage to make me grow;</L>
<L>For, tho' not Power, I have the Will to please,</L>
<L>And Will's a mighty help in such a Case.</L>
<L>We on this fruitful Soyl have Women seen,</L>
<L>That in few Months have grown as big agen.</L>
<L>Oh Iemminy! what is the Cause of that?</L>
<L>I wonder what they Eat to grow so Fat?</L>
<L>We young ones know not how that business is;</L>
<L>But for all that we may be allow'd to guess;</L>
<L>And I beginning now to chatter Sence,</L>
<L>Encourag'd, may divert a Twelve-month hence:</L>
<L>And therefore humbly thus I make Address,</L>
<L>Excuse Faults, and accept my Will to please;</L>
<L>But if you fail me, may you nevermore</L>
<L>Kiss Woman under (at the least) fourscore.</L>
