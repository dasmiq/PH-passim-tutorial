<HEAD>&leaf; Phillip Mornay,
Lord of Plessis his Teares:
to his wife CHARLOTTE
BALLISTE.</HEAD>
<P>_DEare wife, see|ing
that in this
aboundant sor|row,
wee can
haue no solace
but from the
sorrow it selfe, nor any ease for
this deepe wound, but what
must be fetched from the wou~d,
let vs make much of it: stoppe it
too soone, it spoiles vs: stay it
too long, it kills vs. I doe not
therefore exhort you to exclude
lamentation: farre bee that want
of feeling from vs; let vs euer
want this want of true affect.
Should you become obdurate,
flinty, free from sence of sorrow?
<PB REF="5">
oh no: Gods corrections neuer
propound vs this condition:
the Lords punishments are to
far other purpose: No, let vs be
mooued, let vs bee melted. And
my desire is that we acquaint our
selues fully with this accidentall
(not eternall) affliction: let vs
affoord this corrosiue vlcer som|what
to feede vpon easily, least
it feed vpon our owne bosomes
too fiercely: let vs tame this vn|tamed
accident, and take it into
our essence: let vs make it a part
of that substance which it hath
already wholy transformed: it
is now become one of our essen|tiall
parts, no more a passion, no
more an imperfection. Heere
then are our teares for thee
to vse, if it bee inflamed, to
coole it; if it bee ranckled, to
<PB REF="5">
supple it: put it from vs, nay
shake it off vs we cannot, &amp; wic|ked
were we truely if wee could;
wee are depriued of a sonne,
(deare wife) an onely sonne: and
ah how good a sonne! our God
the true comforter, be our com|fort:
he that hath caused our sor|rowes,
conclude them: bee hee
our cure, that hath procured our
hurt: onely comforter, onely
Chirurgian. But stay: hee hath
spared our sonne, that s<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter">ared not
his owne onely begotten for vs:
he hath acquitted him from this
world, and admitted him into a
better: timely, in respect of his
owne age, &amp; no more but time|ly
in respect of the ages of most
besides him: freeing him from
the conditions, nay the corrup|tions
of this age, maugre all the
<PB REF="6">
vainely-banded vowes of all
such as wisht his presence, and
wept for his departure.</P>
<P><HI>PHILIP MORNAY, PHILIPS</HI>
Sonne, making an enterprise
vnder the <HI>Graue Maurice,</HI> vp|on
the Citty of <HI>Geldre,</HI> hauing
broken open the first and se|cond
gate, and bending all his
power and endeuour against the
laste, with a Musket-shot was
struck through the brest, and fel;
leauing behind him the reward
of his vertues, included in the
worlds generall lamentation for
him, as hee had possessed it with
honorable hopes of him.</P>
<P><PB REF="6">
Hee was borne at <HI>Antwerp</HI> in his
fathers Embassage: 1579. the
20. day of Iulie: and was
made immortall, 1605&punc; the 23.
of October.</P>
<P>Nature hath wept out the
teares shee had: Now let rea|son;
and piety weepe their
partes, for they haue their
springs of sorrow as well as the
other: though not so fluent, not
so abundant; yet more pure,
more excellent, more eternall.
When Nature hath drain'd the
source of her teares dry, then
come these two, and supplie
sorrowes current.</P>
<P>What, shall I then speake
out my woes, or shall I entombe
them in silence? I had but one
<PB REF="7">
one onely sonne, perhaps I shall
neuer haue more. This sonne,
our God bestowed bountifully
vpon our vowes: and this same
sonne (our God) our vowes re|turned
dutifully vnto thee, and
that instantly after. Hee was but
now borne, thou hadst but now
giuen him vs, when wee gaue
him back againe to thee: he but
now sawe the world, when the
world saw him thine in his edu|cation,
and our dedication.
Grace hir selfe was the grace|woman,
the Midwife that recei|ued
him from his Mother, gaue
him Milke, and attended his first
houre of birthe: so did Piety
his infancie, Learning his child|hood,
Vertue his youth, Hone|stie
his fuller growth and firmer
age. And yet so kinde was this
<PB REF="7">
contention of the corporall and
mentall vertues, being all en|ranged
&amp; enrooted in him, that
neither did his strength make
him decline vnto pride, his good
shape to loosenesse, his learning
to vanitie, his valour to cruelty,
or his loue of vprightnesse vnto
any sowrenesse of manners: his
towardnesse so happily preuen|ted
his education, his fruite
stept in before his flower, and
true grauitie tooke place in his
heart, ere any little downe had
spred it selfe on his face. So gra|ciously
were these contraries ga|thered
together, each one to be|stowe
the proper grace, without
endamaging the residue. And al|ready
now began hee to be stiled
the Staye of his Parents, the
Starre of his countrie, that I
<PB REF="8">
(faine foole) was a saying. <HI>My
roote is spred out by the waters,
and the dew shall lie vpon my
branch. My glory shall renew to|wardes
me, &amp; my bow shalbe restor|ed
to my hand.</HI> In him I am renew|ed,
in him I am reniued, that was
otherwise halfe dead, and more
then halfe dust. But behold! thou
breathed'st but vpon him, &amp; as y^<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">
downe of a flower he flew away
in fleeces.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob. 14. 3. &amp; 15. 33</NOTE> <HI>He shot forth as a flower,
and is cut downe: thou hast taken
him away, as the vnripe grape:
thou hast cast him off, as the O|liue
doth her flower.</HI></P>
<P>Here, is the heart-strings of
comfort, all cut! here (LORD)
how can I speake inough,
though I were all tongue! how
can my stupid silence bee suffici|ent,
were I all flint? Thy <HI>Ionas,</HI>
<PB REF="8">
Lord, for who~ thou preparedst a
<HI>goord,</HI> in the shadow wherof his
faint sadnes might be refreshed,
as soone as the touch of the
worme turned the verdure into
canker, and the beames of the
Sun beat vpon his head, his cou|rage,
at an instant, conuerted into
faintnesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ionah. 4. 8.</NOTE> <HI>It is better for me</HI> (saith
he) <HI>to die then to liue.</HI> Thus this
great Prophet grew in passion a|gainst
thee for shewing thy
power vpon his poore shelter,
vpon that little shade he sat in:
what then shall poore I say to
one so potent? I, that am sodden
in sorrow, and yet my boy|ling
brought to no end! ex|posed
to the sonnes fierie ri|gor,
neuer to bee remooued,
neuer to bee refreshed! Oh my
LORD! I feele a rebellious
<PB REF="9">
battell within me! keepe downe
my tongue, let it loose to no
language, but those sounds of
the Psalmist: <HI>I am dumbe; and
do not open my mouth, because thou
hast done it.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 39. 10</NOTE> <HI>But thou Lord, laye
thine hand vpon my mouth,</HI> that
my redoubling dolour burst not
out into outragious murmure;
and I beeing a foole my selfe,
<HI>charge GOD with foolishnesse.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob. 1. 22.</NOTE></P>
<P>My sonne, when as yet his
child-hood swayed his estate in
nature, bent his full endeuour to
the attaining perfection in the
principall tongues, and all ho|nest
and honourable disciplines:
hee neuer wanted instigation,
but rather inhibition, his for|wardnesse
was so toward, and
his towardnesse so forward: and
still as his growth enabled him,
<PB REF="9">
so hee enured himselfe to all il|lustrious
exercises, sharing his
time betweene the splendor and
light of learning, and the thun|der
and lightning of warre: that
<HI>Mars</HI> did seeme to grudge that
<HI>Minerua</HI> had so great a part in
his perfections. His youth saw
him a traueler in most countries
Christian, extracting what euer
made for vertue, where euer he
found it, and expelling vicious
affect farre from him, where e|uer
he met it.</P>
<P>The industry, and ornament
of each peculiar, was in his ob|seruation
(as in a store-house)
carefully reposed for practise:
the defects and exorbitance of
each, obserued also, but without
the slightest acquaintance and
with the carefullest auoydance
<PB REF="10">
of their least touch, or tainte.</P>
<P>But now, growing to one de|gree
rearer y^e ful man, &amp; behold|ing
<HI>France</HI> her pacification with
a minde not minding peace,
resoluing to set forth his vertue
vpon y^e quest of Honor, away he
departeth to <HI>Holland,</HI> (y^e worlds
Theater or the sepulcher whe|ther?)
to giue his valour action
vnder Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> the <HI>Fort|razer</HI>
of this our age, and there
duely performeth all the due|ties
of a future captaine, and a
present-hearted souldior. For
hauing had command in diuers
seruices vnder the vnconque|red
King of <HI>France,</HI> by his es|peciall
appointment, hee was
firmely resolued to write in
wounds vpon his enemies bo|dies,
that he was worthy of that
<PB REF="10">
enstalment from so worthy an
aduocate. Many held his resolu|tion
too hot, and heady, but that
he would haue left, had he liued:
the tempera<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">e affects that at|tend
vpon the years of maturity
would haue allaied his youthful
feruor, had he surniued to haue
seene maturty. Meane while, all
these illustrious instruments
of industrious verture, stored he
togither, for y^e glory of his God,
the seruice of his King&punc; the bene|fit
of his country, &amp; the defence
of honesty, in euery son of hirs:
they were also prepared by pie|ty,
so seasoned by equity, and
so preserued by charity: it was
admirable to see Zeale haue so
faire an harbour in such a youth|full
and fiery spirit: and Piety
to stand&punc; supported with diuine
<PB REF="11">
studies, higher by the head and
shoulders the~ al y^e other (though
high &amp; honorable vertues. Here
againe began I to set vp my rest,
and trust vpon him, as on a stay
to my feete and a staffe to mine
age: O my Lord (said I) <HI>Thou of
thy louing kindnesse hast made my
mountaine to stand strong:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ps. 30. 7.</NOTE> <HI>thou</HI>
(Lord) <HI>art the shadow on my right
hand.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ps. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter"> 21. 5.</NOTE> But ah! behold: <HI>the thing
I feared, is fallen vponmee: the
thing I was afraid of,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter">. 25.</NOTE> <HI>is befallen
mee.</HI></P>
<P>Here is a sad breach of na|tures
order, for the father to
prepare the funerall of the
Sonne: for the father to bee the
sons suruiuer.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob. 7. 10</NOTE> <HI>All the thoughts of
my heart are now turned into con|fusion.</HI>
All my affaires in my
house, in my heart, all quite
<PB REF="11">
confou~ded: vtterly out of frame!
<HI>Goe then and guird thy selfe with
sackcloth</HI> (wretched man) <HI>wal|lovv
thy selfe in ashes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter">erem. 6 27</NOTE> <HI>make la|mentation
and bitter mourning.</HI>
Why, let mee goe meete with
death also, what delight is there
in delay? I, I, that haue out-li|ued
so many sorrowes, so ma|ny
perills, nay now the losse of
mine owne bowells, and nerues,
and yet liue to record the cut|ting
of mine owne heart-stringes,
nay my heart it selfe?
Thou hadest a King (LORD)
and Israell had a light, who
when hee heard of the death
of his Sonne, albeit hee was
a rebell and would haue beene
a parricide, yet burst out in
a full presence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 18</NOTE> and cried: <HI>O Ab|salon
my sonne, vvould God I had
<PB REF="12">
died for thee:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 18</NOTE> <HI>O</HI> Absalon <HI>my son.</HI>
Thus turned hee the safety of
his people into teares and
mourning, and shamed the fa|ces
of all his seruants, beeing
so loath to leaue the dust hee
layd in, that <HI>Ioab</HI> was faine to
threaten him with the sedition
and departure of the people
from him. What then shal I do?
ah what shall I not doe? hauing
lost an only sonne, a companion,
a kinsman, a brother the~! whom,
(choose which of these you can)
neuer man had a better! what
life is worth loue, nay what
death is not worth life to mee in
this helplesse extremity!</P>
<P>Oh but, my soule, my soule,
returne a little vnto thy rest:
mans waies, nor his life thou
knowest are in his hand: <HI>In the
<PB REF="12">
Lords hand is the breath of eue|ry
liuing thing and the soule
of all mankinde.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob. 12. 10.</NOTE> And <HI>GOD
cutteth of the daies of man:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob. 14. 16.</NOTE> <HI>for
in his hand is in the number of
his monethes:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob. 24. 12</NOTE> which none ei|ther
preuenteth, or surpasseth,
and yet doth not GOD de|cree
any thing with follie.</P>
<P>Therefore say rather to thy
selfe and bee not sorie for say|ing
so.</P>
<P>I am dumbe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psa. 39. 1.</NOTE> and doe not open
my mouth, because thou hast
done it.</P>
<P>But thou (LORD) keepe a
bridle within my mouth, be sure
(Lord) that thou see, that my lips
be not let loose to impute vnius|tice
vnto thee: oh no but let the~
<PB REF="13">
euer oppose iniquity, &amp; attri|bute
righteousnesse vnto my
maker.</P>
<P>Ah! but (my gracious Lord)
I am full of (dolorous) matter:
my spirit swells within me, and
compells mee! Behold, my bel|ly
is as the wine that hath no
vent: &amp; wanting vent, resembles
the embotteled aire that
breakes through all that bind|eth
it in.</P>
<P>Therefore I wil speake (I thinke
it bee best) that I may take
some breath, against this abun|dant
excesse of sorrowe. Thou
knowest (LORD of all mine,
and all others life) what I ay|med
at, in my Sonne, my scope
in him was not excluded from
thy supereminent vnderstand|ing.
Had I any thought, any
<PB REF="13">
intent but to imploy his lustre
wholy to the illustration of thy
glory, the Churches good in|crease,
and his Kings &amp; countries
grace? no, no, I consecrated his
yeeres in their fullest maturity,
his vnderstanding, in the grea|test
perfection, wholy and soly
to those sacred employments.
At that, all my vowes leuelled;
vnto that, all my prayers ten|ded;
with that, all mine instruc|tions
concluded; &amp; in y^<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">, all mine
endeuours were bounded: that,
ah! nothing but that, was the
center from which all my cogi|tations
were drawne, and the
circle to which they tended. But
it was thy pleasure (Lord) in
the meane space, to make mee
the point, the marke, where-at
thou wouldest shoote, so that I
<PB REF="14">
am now become mine owne
burden. Nay thou hast shot me
thorow, &amp; that through the sides
of mine onely sonne: striking
Father and childe starke dead
both at one stroke. Alas, thou
Lord of mine, are thine eares
become deafe? is thine heart
growne obdurate also: is that
that eternall, neuer-dried foun|taine
of thy free mercy, frozen
with colde, or dryed with heate,
when I come to drinke, and vnto
none but mee? It is true&punc; Lord
that <HI>If I should dispute with thee,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob. 9. 3. &amp; 12.</NOTE>
<HI>I should not answere thee to one
thing in a thousand!</HI> Thou art
wise in heart, and mightie in
strength: <HI>When thou takest a
prey, who can enforce thee to re|store
it? who shall say vnto thee,
why didst thou thus?</HI> I, but I do not
<PB REF="14">
sticke in the courts of thy pow|er
Lord, I presse in, vnto thy
very sanctuarie, and looke all
about mee, vpon thine exceed|ing
power, commixt and con|temperate
with thine vnmeasu|red
goodnesse, and thine inscru|table
wisdome.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 73,</NOTE> <HI>Thou Lord art
righte<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">us in all thy wayes, &amp;</HI> mer|cifully)
<HI>holy in all thy workes:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 145. 17,</NOTE> Nay,
<HI>thy mercy is aboue all thy workes.</HI>
Therefore are thy iudgements
deep, &amp; thy mercies a boundles,
a soundlesse depth: thou giuest
these, as Cauterismes in Phisick,
not as hurtes in hostilitie. Wee
thoght thou hadst not heard our
vowes, and see thou hast heard
them truer then wee were aware
of: our wordes it may bee thou
refusedst, but our intents thou
hast admitted: and signed both
<PB REF="15">
our desires with a better condi|tion
to vs both: to our sonne
thou hast done better, in taking
backe as thy iust due, him that
thou hadst but lent vnto vs du|ring
thine Almighty pleasure,
and seating him in Heauen,
whome thou hadst but shewen
(and scarcely that) vnto the
Earth: to vs thou hast done bet|ter,
in taking him out of the
dangers of the worlds deuou|ring
whirle-pittes, wherein per|haps
wee might (vnto our more
excesse of sorrow) haue seene
him swallowed, and haue swum
after that Funerall in a Sea of
more bitter teares.</P>
<P>Once againe, here Lord, seale
vp my lippes: once more, here
binde mine organs of speech:
for the flesh rebels, and compels
<PB REF="15">
me, nor see I meanes to bridle
it, it is growne so head-strong,
and so impatient of suppression.
It bids mee say, why tookest
thou him away ere his time?
thou inexorable creditor that
wouldest not stay thy day, but
catche him vp ere his fate was
ready to call him.</P>
<P>True, thou fraile flesh and
bloud: why was it not his time
to take him, that was Times
Creator? and what is fate, but
the will of GOD the Father?
And what better limite hath
life in any of vs all, then the rest
from all our labour? And what
matter is it whether the ship of
our mortality bee brought to
the hauen by a sterne tempest,
or a gentle gale? by winde, or
by tide? had not hee that from
<PB REF="16">
all eternitye predestinated the
moment of his birthe, the same
power to decree the houre of
his death by? If thou haue any
reason to complaine that thou
lost him so soone, the same
cause hast thou to expostulate
why thou hadst him no sooner,
or no later, but e<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">en then when
hee was giuen thee: and doost
thou thinke hee hath not liued
long enough, whose life his
countrie extolleth, &amp; whose fu|nerall
song the purest Christ of
God singeth?</P>
<P>This, as vertues desired re|warde,
haue many worthye
men bestowed much toyle to
attaine, hardly deseruing it in
their declining age, and their
frostiest part of nature, which
hee gotte signed him, ere hee
<PB REF="16">
gotte out of his youth, ere his
age was at the Summer Solstice:
namely his wish, and want, in the
hearts of al such as honor good|nesse?</P>
<P>Therefore thou talkest like
a foolish Woman: goe and
learne better language of the
wise:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wis. 4. 10.</NOTE> <HI>It is not length of time,
but wisdome,</HI> a life well lead, a

<P><HI>The sanctified man, dye hee

euer.</P>
<P>But thou hast no measure, thou
fraile corruption, thou art in my
<PB REF="17">
bosome againe with an other
friuolous obiection. Hee was

vs grant them (that which God
seldome granteth,) their full
growth: the fruite they bring, is
vnprofitable, not relishing any
taste, nor befitting any vse. But
<PB REF="18">
call thy thoughts home to thine
owne issue: why in him, his
sweetnesse of fruite thrust his
sweete blossome from the stalke,
his vnparalleld vertue pressed
out the delicious iuice of his
sweete fruite, and left it to bee
casked vp by all succeeding po|steritie.
And now the tents of
the godly are perfumed with
his rare, and redolent fragrancie:
his heate, nay and that in the
height, his ardor, armes, and ani|mates
them all to emulation of
vertue. Time ranked many with
him in respect of age, and gaue
his fore-lock into diuerse hands
assoone as his, yet were there not
any of his time that knit that
lock into so many knots of vertue
as he did: what canst thou grum|ble
further at? yet mee thinkes
<PB REF="18">
thou art not satisfied: oh thou
wouldst faine haue had him, as
thou thoughtst thou hadst be|gotten
him, to beene the heire
of thine intents, to haue beene
enfcoffed in thy determinations,
and haue suruiued to haue inhe|rited
thine honest and goldy en|deuoures.</P>
<P>I pray thee now looke after
him once for mee, that hast
longed so for him in thy selfe.
Now, blind man, hath he not dis|cerned
his heritage himselfe, and
is he not now seized of that re|all
inheritance where thou woul|dest
share with him with all
thine heart? hath hee not left
thee, his countrie, and the church
possessed with as plentifull and
as pleasant fruit, as such a greene
stock as his could possibly bring
<PB REF="19">
to perfection? yes: and GOD
himselfe hath layde it vp in his
<HI>Granary:</HI> &amp; that I thinke makes
thee most melancholie, because
thou thinkest that God hath lost
the more absolute vse that thy
sonnes farther yeares might
haue affoorded him.</P>
<P>Goe to, keepe thy selfe con|tent,
and let Gods losses lye vp|on
his owne hand: it is in his
power out of this heape of
stones, to rayse himselfe ser|uants,
the country souldiers, and
the Church supporters: cannot
he fill the heauens with legions
of Saints, the earth with hoasts
of Protectors, and his Church
with millions of assistants, but
hee must bee faine to take a cor|ruptible
mans direction, and
stand drawing out the life of this
<PB REF="19">
man or that, longer then his e|ternity
liketh? ah farre bee it
from true sence to bee so bee|sotted.</P>
<P>Why so then, I am satisfi|ed:
giue mee leaue, I will now
take the bitte out of my mouth
my selfe, and plead the cause of
the all-sufficient Creator, euen
against mine owne soule. Why
doost thou not see then (deere
wife) how all the worlde like a
Bowle, is ouer-swayed by the
ouer strong byas of iniquitie, &amp;
bends (despite all opposition,) to
black corruption? oh how secu|lent,
how pestilent a vapour of
sinne drawes euery man in with
the first breath hee takes, attrac|ting
vices as innumerable as <HI>At|tomes,</HI>
euen in his first moment of
respiration: and the longer hee
<PB REF="20">
liueth to draw his breath, the su|rer
foote-hold hee giueth vici|ousnesse
in his foule bosome,
and settleth the contagion in
his soule: which the deuill is
sure of, though he be sencelesse
of: Sathan hath a beadroll of
those impious, and daily increa|sing
inhabitants, though the
poore Land-lord taketh no note
of their entrie to possession, nor
receiues any rent of them but
ruine: happy hee (too few so
happy!) that can bring his acti|on
against them before GODS
bench, or in that celestiall starre-chamber,
and remooue them
from possession by a bill of re|pentance:
but few such suites go
forward: the world comes with
one bribe, and the flesh with an|other:
&amp; either too easily (GOD
<PB REF="20">
knowes) can perswade the poore
plaintiffe to let his action fall: for
this flesh, let the soule, let the spi|rit
come neuer so fresh, neuer so
zealous, neuer so hot in that zeale
fro~ the hand of God, it will finde
one angle or other in, wherein it
may sow the seed of sin, &amp; plant
a too fruitefull infection. And
when the soule is once dipped in
worldly delights, what should
deliuer it from being drowned
therein? What hold hath any
one that is once ouer the shooes
in iniquity, vpon any thing that
may saue him from slipping in
ouer the shoulders? &amp; what pri|uiledge
had the court of heauen
granted our sonne more then an|other?
had he a lease of his soules
life letten him? none.</P>
<P>And wee see, (and might learne
<PB REF="21">
by sight of it) that vertue when
it is exalted, and eleuate, if it be|gin
once to drawe damnation
in, it becometh graduate in the
most extreame degree of vici|ousnesse.
Yes. yes, when good|nesse
once misseth the true tract,
and lights into the broade way
of blacke destruction, it will
hardlye heare of any reclaime,
but maketh the more speede to
mischiefe, and runnes headlong
to euident ruine.</P>
<P>So then, was it not better for
our sonne to haue taken paye
for a little space in the Campe
of Vertue, then to haue beene
enranked as an olde attendant
in the Court of vice? and had
hee not better haue beene ex|posed
to an houres sharpe
toyle, then to a yeares subtle
<PB REF="21">
temptation? Thinke but of him
as hee was indeed. A youth of
an egregious alacritye, a pene|trating
spirit, and an vnbounded
ayme. His vigorous vertue
would enter vpon any enter|prise,
and generally the effect
would answere his endeauour:
his valour found no obstacle so
obstinate but it would through
it, and bring glorie through
it againe? breaking the squa|drons
of the most sollid opposi|tions,
and mounting his honor
vpon the rubbish of their ruined
forces.</P>
<P>Now beeing such an one (and
such hee was indeed!) his heart
lay open to all the assaults of af|fect,
of glory: desire of renowne
(you know) might soone haue
put him out of the pace that
<PB REF="22">
vertue had taught him: ambiti|on
is a great fowler, and of ex|ceeding
cunning in her baytes:
why might not hee haue start
out, and haue slipt into one of
her sprindges? might not that
(holy) hunger after honor haue
turned his wrong side outward
and haue led him cleere out of
the sight of sobriety in affecti|on?
yes, and this hunger is most
commonly an vtter enemie to
the temperate diet of vertue,
and cannot endure to eate any
thing that moderation prouid|eth.</P>
<P>Besides, lofty spirits (if they
bee really eleuate) can neuer
brooke the horrible decay of ho|norable
worth in these decli|ning
times, and this Sunne-set
of the world, but will some|times
<PB REF="22">
flie out, and aduance their
spirit in his ful freedome against
these ages neglect of the deser|uing
worthie, and then comes
porte and power, together
with their appendants or hang|bies,
and treades out the light
of their most glorious lustre: Ah
this is too true, and thus might
our sonne haue beene lost, had
hee liued any longer.</P>
<P>But indeede true sorrowe
will alwaies build vpon false
grounds to augment it selfe, if
it bee not taken vppe in time,
and if it once gette heade, it
will haue a reason to shewe
for any vnreasonable passion
that it shall entertaine. In truth
it is true.</P>
<P>For hee that greeueth vn|fainedlie,
greeueth also that
<PB REF="23">
any one should hold his griefes
cause not sufficient to procure
a greater affect of sorrow then
hee endureth. But tell mee
now I pray thee (louing wife)
wouldst thou not haue lost thy
sonne? no, wouldst thou not
haue had him transported from
this ruined state that earth stand|eth
in, vnto that excellence of e|eternity
that heauen affordeth?
yes. Why, now then, seeing that
thou seest hee hath preuented
thine expectation, and is gotten
vp thether long before thou
thoughtst hee should, why hast
not thou reason to say with the
wise man:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wis. 4. 10. 11.</NOTE> <HI>He pleased God, and was
beloued of him, so that where as hee
liued amongst sinners, hee trans|lated
him:</HI> This was <HI>Henock</HI> (wife)
a man that was full of the feare
<PB REF="23">
of God. <HI>And hee was taken a|way
least wickednesse should alter
his vnderstanding, and least de|ceite
should haue beguiled his
minde.</HI> And thus, and no other|wise
but thus, hath our glorious
GOD taken away our Sonne,
like a good Father, who seeing
his Sonne placed in the broadest
beeach of peruersenesse, takes
him out of danger in time, least
hee should bee drawne into too
euident danger, and bee strucke
downe by one shot or other
from the assaylant enemy: The
deluge of wickednesse, hath al|most
couered the highest moun|taine
of Godlinesse, and good
manners; and therefore blessed
be God that hath set our son in a
place of so blessed security.</P>
<P>The sonnes of men growe
<PB REF="24">
more and more peremptory a|gainst
the prescriptions of the
highest, the monuments of
goodnesse are so weather-bea|ten,
that iniquity and antiquity
hath almost left no character
thereof vndefaced: the rust of ir|religiousnes
hath eaten into the
most steely tempers of our age:
&amp; had our son (thinkest thou) any
especiall protection promised
him? no, effect in others con|firmeth
this to vs. Wipe away
those teares once more that gush
out in such abou~dance (seeming
as if hee were not dead already,
to drowne him in his graue:) and
consider but this: How inumera|ble
and almost ineuitable trap|falls
are set in the tract of ver|tue,
in all her walkes? Here you
shall haue one that will kisse the
<PB REF="24">
visar of vertue: but shew them
her true face, and you turne all
their kisses vnto curses.</P>
<P>You shall haue other some
that while shee is vnderfoote,
will lend her a hand to helpe her
vp: but when shee is vppe and
hath gotten wing, and mount|eth,
then they either suspect
hir themselues, or buzze
suspicions of her into the heads
of others.</P>
<P>Affording hir all their dili|gent
culture while shee is a
springing, but growing once
aloft, they make haie of
her ere shee come to her
hight, and rend her vp by the
rootes.</P>
<P>And then there is that
pestilence reigning euer a|mongst
men of equallity, in
<PB REF="25">
what ranke soeuer, I meane <HI>En|vye:</HI>
and her nature, and conse|quently
her practise is euer to
persecute that good which shee
cannot paralell. That hight
which she cannot mount vnto,
shee presently vndermines, set|ting
all her <HI>Pioners, cauillation,
detraction,</HI> and <HI>derision</HI> on worke
vpon the ruine of that glorie
which shee cannot reach: it is
her food to bee felt heauy vpon
the highest fortunes. And this
is the source of all the grudges,
malice, and altercations that
haue beene the pestilence which
hath swept such multituds from
the bosome of our mother
<HI>France:</HI> this malice, oh this
madnesse of the Nobility, that
(for ought I can see) are now but
bastards to their ancestours
<PB REF="25">
valour: these adulterous births,
haue obscured the rising glory
of <HI>France,</HI> with the mystes ari|sing
from the bleeding bodyes
that haue fallen in this fatall
warre: wherein with thoughts
more bloudy piercing then their

of goodnesse beeing thrust ou<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">
of the true place, the brother

as vppon his fiercest ene|mie.</P>
<P>And looke now; our sonne
is acquit from hauing any hand
in these desperate hacksters ac|tions,
and sittes aloft, looking
downe, and laughing at this lit|tle
lumpe of earth, (so ouer|growne
with <HI>Spuma Cerberi,</HI> and

<PB REF="26">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">

<PB REF="27">
which he hath left beneath

<P>But what comfort canst thou
haue of this, or I, that share
with thee in this sorrow if wee
stand shaking our hands, or ar|ming
our hearts against GOD,
who is the onely consolation in
the extreamest agonie, and an|guish
of heart? Are not wee of
them that haue receiued the
seale of the Lion of <HI>Iudah?</HI> are we
not Christians? Downe, downe,
perturbed spirit! thou abortiue
of misery.</P>
<P>Why? but God might haue
shielded him from all these en|counters
of vicious extreames.
You neede not tell mee that:
I know hee might: but had hee
not made him a fraile mortall?
<PB REF="27">
nay, and had hee not appointed
him a place in warres, and instil|led
a Military vigor into him?
Being euery day betweene the
chaps of death, why might hee
not be catcht at length? is it pos|sible
to stand in a shower of hail|stones,
&amp; haue not one to touch
him?</P>
<P>GOD had made him valo|rous:
the likelier to bee ouer|ha<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">dy
in daring of death, and so
ouer-taken in his too much heat,
and too little dread. God had
made him with an heart that
put forth his rigour in all the
endeuoures of masculine ver|tue:</P>
<P>Alas, what was hee in this,
but a fayre shotte-marke for
foule Enuie? a rocke for the
<PB REF="28">
vntaught billowes of iniurious
suspect to beate against, and
perhaps (though breaking ma|nie
of themselues first) at length
to shake downe into ruine?</P>
<P>Didst thou looke to haue him
miraculously lifted vp from his
seate in this sea of deprauati|on?
What warrant hath GOD
giuen the for that? what bar|gaine
had Fate made with thee,
or mee, including any such
condition?</P>
<P>How much more com fort
should we finde, and how much
more easily should wee settle
the rebellious affects that keepe
this coyle in our bosomes, if
wee would steppe a little out of
this wildnesse of conceite, and
suffer our imaginations to bee
<PB REF="28">
guided vnto Truth by the sette
order of nature, by mans fraile
estate in this order, and by the
reall cause of this frayltie of
state?</P>
<P>Death ending man in this or|der,
time bringing him on to
death, and originall sinne (the
due deseruer of death) bring|ing
man forth to his first mo|ment
of time? Such considera|tions
as these, were farre more
fitte for vs, then to cast off our
thoughts at randon, to suffer
them flye beyond the pitche
of our obedience to our ma|ker.</P>
<P>And now tell mee true (<HI>con|sideratis
considerandis</HI>) and all
accompts beeing cast, is not
our sorrow exceedingly lighte|ned,
<PB REF="29">
to see our beloued sonne
deliuered from those complete
armed Battailions of deadly dan|gers,
that enuironed him on e|uery
side? Tell mee now thou
vile and mis-beleeuing flesh, hast
thou not now reason to turne
ouer a new leafe, and to say with
that holy singer: <HI>I acknowledge O
Lord, that thy iudgements are iust:
and that thou hast afflicted me, for
my faith: for tryall of my faith.
God is</HI> (euer) <HI>good vnto Israel, and
pure in heart.</HI></P>
<P>He is so, and when his wrath
seemeth to threaten vs in most
terrible thunder, then raigneth
hee his mercy vpon vs in a most
mellifluous dew. I will there|fore
turne mee, (I will leaue all
and turne mee) to my GOD,
<PB REF="29">
and on him will I build my con|fidence.</P>
<P>And now shall my mouth bee
shutte no more: but I will turne
it into a Trumpet, in the cause
and quarrell of the Almightie:
This will I resound, and of this
shall all the world returne an
Eccho, <HI>Thou hast done it O Lord,
and well hast thou done it.</HI></P>
<P>Well hast thou done it: for
thou canst doe nothing but well:
being thy selfe the neuer dryed
Well of goodnesse. Vnto the
good, nothing befalls but good:
come it in neuer so horred a
shape of mischiefe; in a forme
neuer so fearefull.</P>
<P>Well hast thou done vnto our
sonne, in taking him out of the
perillous conflicts where-into
<PB REF="30">
hee had nowe set foote (and
that was all, if hee had done
that) and bestowing his free|dome
<HI>gratis</HI> vpon him nay and
besides, crowned him with a
Garland of such glory. Had hee
liued longer, hee might haue
runne astray the more, the larger
weight of worldly experience
might haue bent him downe|wards,
and haue fixed his affecti|ons
vpon fading glories. For
there was <HI>Salomon,</HI> whose emi|nence
of wisdome is by the di|uinity
of wisdome it selfe eter|nized
vnto all after ages, as also
his fall is, beeing the more a|mazefull
vnto all posteritie, by

<P><PB REF="30">
Oh what a goodly haruest of

fallen sooner himselfe. What a

sighes to see it.</P>
<P>Well hast thou done also vn|to
mee his Father: for it is not
vnknowne to thee, what an

of thought possessed mee,
concerning his passage out of

all about him: And of his de|scent
from so tottering a stand

like a feuer still hung at mine

<PB REF="31">
which now I see effected, now

stand the last vpon earth.</P>
<P>That is thy Christ (O Lord)
euen our onely Sauiour and
supporter. And though that
wormes turne all our one bo|dies
into themselues, yet shall
wee resume the selfe same flesh,
and behold the blessed in his
Maiesty with these selfe same
eyes.</P>
<P>And there and then shall wee
see our Sonne againe (deere
wife): yes assuredly, in these ve|ry
bodies, wee our selues and no
other for vs, shall see him in that
selfe same house of flesh that hee
held on earth, and in no other.
O thou incomprehensible, sa|cred,
<PB REF="36">
vnbounded, indiuidu|all,
and vnconfounded Trinitie,
grant that our meeting bee to
all our ioyes. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>IN these teares (beloued wife) and
in this manner of sorrow, it is no
sinne to take our orders and pro|ceed
graduates: Wee may weepe
lawfully thus, as long as the
streames that raine from our eyes,
do not make the riuer of our griefes
ouer flowe their bankes, so then,
keeping this channell, let them
droppe from our cheekes eternal|lie:
Let vs make vs pearles of
them, which no bloud, no vine|ger
may euer dissolue. Wee
<PB REF="36">
must say, adieu the worldes com|fort:
needes must wee then lay
faster hold vpon that in Heauen.
Adieu then <HI>Philip</HI> our sonne,
for a while, and welcome
<HI>Iesus</HI> our Sauiour
for euer.</P>
