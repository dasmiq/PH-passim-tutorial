<P><HI>_REader,</HI> this Booke stands at the mercy of thy capacity for thy censure. Perhaps thou wilt iudge it done for oppositions sake; the <HI>Blacke Deuill</HI> to the <HI>White:</HI> perhaps for imitation; perhaps for affectation.

If you would, look here, and detest it. If you will take out a good lesson, and hate to doe it; neither you nor I shall haue cause to re|pent our labours.

<BIBL>Math. cap. 12. ver. 43.</BIBL>
<Q><P>When the vncleane spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.</P>
<P>44. Then he saith, I will returne into my house, from whence I came out. And when hee is come, hee findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.</P>
<P>45. Then goeth he, and taketh with himselfe seuen other spirits more wicked then himselfe; and they enter in, &amp; dwell there. And the last state of that man is worse then the first. Euen so shall it be also vnto this wicked generation.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_OVR <HI>Sauiours</HI> manifold and manifest <HI>Miracles,</HI> which he wrought among and vpon the <HI>Iewes,</HI> were requited with a blasphemous interpretation; that they were done in the power of <HI>Beelzebub.</HI> Which hauing disproued by inuincible
<PB N="2" REF="5">
arguments, he concludes against them in this <HI>Para|ble. When the vncleane spirit &amp;c.</HI> This is clearely manifest in the application. <HI>Euen so shall it be also vn|to this wicked generation.</HI></P>
<P>A double occasion giues vs the hand of direc|tion to this <HI>Speach.</HI> Either it hath a reference to the <HI>Man</HI> dispossessed of the <HI>dumbe</HI> and <HI>blinde Deuill.</HI> ver. 22. Or intends a conuiction of the contumelious blasphemies of the <HI>Iewes.</HI> Perhaps it may be refer|red to the former, but certainely is directed to the latter. It may serue for both: so two gappes be stopp'd with one bush: two sores couer'd with one plaister.</P>
<P N="1">1 It might serue for a charge to the <HI>cured,</HI> to pre|uent recidiuation. He was <HI>dumb;</HI> behold he speaks: he was <HI>blinde;</HI> behold he sees: he was <HI>possessed,</HI> be|hold he is enfranchised. He hath recouered his <HI>eyes,</HI> his <HI>tongue,</HI> his <HI>heart;</HI> hee is rid of the Deuill. Now he that is quit of so bad a Guest, shall septuple his owne woes by his re-entertainment. Such a cauti|on did the same&punc; <HI>physitian</HI> giue another of his Pati|ents. <HI>Iohn 5. Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn 5. 14.</NOTE> <HI>least a worse thing come vnto thee.</HI> It is well for thee, that the <HI>vncleane spirit</HI> is <HI>gone,</HI> but it will be woorse with thee then euer, if he gets in againe.</P>
<P N="2">2. He that did speake life, and to the life, doeth especially meane it to the <HI>Iewes,</HI> with an indubitate appropriation. Cast your eyes vpon the <HI>Text,</HI> and your minds vpon the renegant <HI>Iewes;</HI> and obserue how diametrally they looke one vppon another; running together without alienation, till they come to the end.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="3" REF="5">
1. The <HI>vncleane spirit,</HI> the power of sinne, was <HI>cast out</HI> of the <HI>Iewes,</HI> by <HI>Moses law;</HI> and God had great stirre about it. He was faine to speake <HI>early</HI> and <HI>late,</HI> and attend them <HI>all the day long, with out|stretched</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay. 65. 2.</NOTE> <HI>hands.</HI> Till he appeales to censure. <HI>What could haue beene done more to my Vineyard?</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay. 5. 4,</NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2. At last he is out; and then like a disconten|ted Guest, hindred of his old Lodging, and desti|tute of so warme a bed, he <HI>walks through dry places,</HI> revisites the Heathen. But finding them as strong|ly his owne, as the infrangible chaines of wicked|nesse could make them; he disdaines <HI>rest,</HI> like an Ingrosser, in his owne Lordship; so long as there are other purchases to bee made abroad. Or per|happes the <HI>Arke</HI> of <HI>saluation</HI> is now brought to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and then the <HI>Dagon, Dragon</HI> of hell must needs be packing. A new <HI>King,</HI> the true <HI>King</HI> be|ginning his Raigne in the <HI>Conscience,</HI> deposeth, de|iecteth, eiecteth that vsurping Tyrant. There is no remedy: out he must.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Prince</HI> of the <HI>Ayre</HI> thus discouered, and discomfited by the <HI>Sunne</HI> of <HI>Righteousnesse,</HI> break|ing through the grosse and foggy Clouds of <HI>Igno|rance</HI> and <HI>Impiety,</HI> wherein the <HI>Gentile</HI> world was wrapped: VVhat doth he? but re-salutes his former habitation. He liked the <HI>old seat</HI> well, and will ven|ter a fall, but recouer it.</P>
<P N="4">4. Thether he flyes; and loe, how fit he findes it for his entertaine! The <HI>heart</HI> of the <HI>Iewes is empty</HI> of <HI>Faith; swept</HI> with the beesome of <HI>Hypocrisie,</HI> a iusticiary, imaginary, false-conceited righteousnes;
<PB N="4" REF="6">
and <HI>garnished</HI> with a few broken traditions and ce|remonies; suppellectile complements in stead of substantiall graces.</P>
<P N="5">5. Glad of this, he recollects his forces: <HI>takes with him seauen other spirits,</HI> a greater dominion of sinne, then he was earst armed with all: <HI>more wicked then himselfe;</HI> as if hee would make inuincible pro|uision, and preuention of any future dispossession.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>He enters in</HI> with his crew; not purposing to be as a <HI>Guest,</HI> but a <HI>Tenant;</HI> not a <HI>Tenant,</HI> but a <HI>Land-Lord;</HI> not a <HI>Land-Lord,</HI> but a <HI>King,</HI> a Commander, a Tyrant: till at last he may presume of an indubi|tate right. As Vsurpers that come to a Kingdome by a violent or litigious title, are at first so modest &amp; dainty, that they signe not their Graunts, Edicts, and such publike Acts in their owne particular and singular names, but require the conscription, and euident consent of their Counsell. But once esta|blished by succession, and vnriual'd by opposition, they grow peremptorily confident in their owne right and power, and in their most tyrannous acts dare signe, <HI>Teste meipso.</HI> So <HI>Sathan</HI> at first erecti|on of his Kingdome in the <HI>Iewes,</HI> conscious of his vniust title, was content to admit the helpe of fond Ceremonies, Tales, Traditions, &amp;c. to make for him against <HI>Christ,</HI> whose <HI>Kingdome</HI> hee vsurpes. This he condiscended to out of a mannerly couze|nage, and for the more subtle insinuation into the <HI>Iewish</HI> hearts. But now established in his Throne and confirmed in his title, by their hard-hartednes, and wilfull obstinacy in reiecting their <HI>Messias;</HI> hee
<PB N="5" REF="6">
is bold to signe all his oppositions to the <HI>Gospell</HI> with a <HI>Teste meipso.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Hereupon their <HI>latter end</HI> becomes <HI>worse then their beginning.</HI> A stronger <HI>delusion</HI> hath taken hold of them, and that in the iust iudgement of the wise Ordinatour of all things. <HI>For this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should beleeue a lye:</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Thes. 2. 11. 12.</NOTE> <HI>that all they might bee damned, who be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">eeued not the truth, but had pleasure in vnrighteousnesse.</HI> For if <HI>He that despised Moyses law, dyed without mercy, vn|der two or three Witnesses:</HI> then verse 29. <HI>Of how</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 10 28.</NOTE> <HI>much sorer punishment shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden vnder foote</HI> (not the Seruant, but) <HI>the Sonne of God:</HI> &amp; <HI>hath counted the bloud</HI> (not of Buls and Goates, but) <HI>of the Couenant, wherewith he was sanctified,</HI> (whereby he shall now bee condemned) <HI>an vnholy thing: and hath done despite to the Spirit</HI> (not of <HI>bondage,</HI> but) <HI>of grace.</HI> His beginning was farre better, or at least lesse bad, then his <HI>ende</HI> shall be.</P>
<P>The Occasion was so materiall, that it hath led me further, then eyther my purpose or your pati|ence would willingly haue allowed me. <HI>What soeuer is written, is written</HI> eyther <HI>for our instruction,</HI> or de|struction: to conuert vs, if we embrace it; to con|uince vs, if we despise it.

<P>The <HI>White Deuill,</HI> the <HI>Hypocrite</HI> hath beene for|merly discouer'd, and the sky-colourd vaile of his <HI>dissimulation</HI> pulled off. I am to present to your view and detestation a sinner of a contrary colour, swarthy rebellion, and besmeared <HI>Profanesse:</HI> an <HI>A|postate</HI> falling into the clutches of eight <HI>vncleane spirits.</HI> Needs must he be fowle, that hath so many fowle deuils in him. <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> had but sea|uen, and they were cast out: this hath gotten one more, to make his soule the <HI>blacker,</HI> and they keepe in. If <HI>Hypocrisie</HI> there, were iustly called the <HI>White Deuill; Apostacie</HI> here may as iustly bee termed the <HI>Blacke Deuill.</HI> In the former was a <HI>white</HI> skinne of profession drawne ouer an vlcerous corps: here hyde and carcasse, hand and heart, shadow and sub|stance, seeming and being, outward profession and inward intention, are <HI>blacke,</HI> foule, detestable.

It hath power to informe their iudge|ments, not to reforme their liues.</P>
<P>Now so farre as this illumination, swimming, nimble, and discursiue knowledge is let in; so farre is <HI>Satan</HI> said to be <HI>cast out.</HI> There is, saith <HI>Solomon,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccle. 1. 18. 1.

true heate of zeale. When the most flinty heart shall be hit against the steele of Gods iudgements, it will strike fire: but those sparkles are too weake to kindle the true warmth of grace; the fewell is so greene, the affections so vicious, whereon it works. <HI>Peccaui</HI> was <HI>Dauids</HI> voyce after his sinfull Arithme|ticke: <HI>Iudas</HI> his voyce after his abhorred treason. <HI>Vox eadem, non poenitentia: talis sonus, non sinus.</HI> The same voyce or sound, not the same heart or peni|tence. <HI>Esau wept</HI> hauing lost the blessing: <HI>Peter wept</HI> hauing denyed his <HI>Mayster:</HI> nether wept with|out bitternesse. <HI>Similes lachrymae, non animae.</HI> The like <HI>teares,</HI> not the like <HI>Consciences.</HI> Iron and steele heat in the fire, are plyable to the fashioning ham|mer: let them be colde, and they resume their for|mer hardnesse.

But let the fire cease, and giue him leaue to be cold againe, and he becomes harder then e|uer before. <HI>Nil facil&egrave; quamuis non tueare, perit.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Satan</HI> is so farre said to be <HI>gone out,</HI> as he lyes hidden, like mudde and slime vnder a thicke snow. The <HI>Deuill</HI> may bee within the grate, though hee thrust not out his apparant hornes. Or say, he be walked abroad, yet he returnes home at night: and in the meane time, like a mistrustfull Churle, lockes the doore after him; sparres vp the heart with secu|rity, that his treasure be not stolne. Thus as a snaile,
<PB N="20" REF="14">
he gathers vppe himselfe into his shell and house of the heart, when he feares discouery, and puts not forth his hornes. Sometimes he playes not in the Sunne actually, but borroughes deepe in the affec|tions. The foxe keepes his den close, when he knowes that Gods hunts-men bee abroad to seeke him. He knowes that oftentimes <HI>armis pollentior astus,</HI> his fraud is beyond his force: that he is <HI>pesti|lentior arte qu&agrave;m marte:</HI> that hee poysons more mortally <HI>melle qu&agrave;m felle:</HI> that he may doe as much hurt in a maske of <HI>white,</HI> as in his owne <HI>blacke</HI> habit: that he may spoyle more Lambes in a Sheepe-skin, then appearing as a wolfe. He is content to yeeld to a shew of holinesse, that he may worke the more mischiefe. It is sufficient for him if he may, though (not <HI>turbare</HI> yet <HI>turpare)</HI> not disquiet, yet dishonest the soule of man. Now so farre as this touch of religion enters, is this <HI>vncleane Spirit</HI> saide <HI>gone out.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Satan</HI> may be saide <HI>cast out,</HI> in the opinion of the party, in whom he resides. Euery one pre|sumes, there is no <HI>Deuill</HI> within him. The <HI>proud</HI> hath no <HI>Lucifer,</HI> the <HI>Couetous</HI> no <HI>Mammon,</HI> the <HI>Ido|later</HI> no <HI>Melchom,</HI> the <HI>Adulterer</HI> no <HI>vncleane spirit.</HI> Let me catechise thee. <HI>I did promise in my Baptisme, to for sake the Deuill.</HI> VVhat? doest thou stay there?

Whilst thou slu~brest in thy waftage, the vessell goes on stil. <HI>Satan</HI> is not out, though thou conceitest him
<PB N="21" REF="14">
<HI>gone:</HI> and so as it is in our phrase, he is <HI>gone in conceit.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. This <HI>vncleane spirit</HI> may seeme <HI>gone</HI> in the opinion of the <HI>Church.</HI> Sometime the Deuill is <HI>gone</HI> from a man in his owne iudgement, not the worlds: sometimes in the worlds iudgement, not his owne. The <HI>Church</HI> had a good estimation of <HI>Iudas,</HI> as conformable to the outward duties of o|bedience, and the rather because <HI>Christ</HI> trusted him with the <HI>stewardship:</HI> but God and his owne consci|ence knew him a <HI>theefe.</HI> The Deuill wil not alwayes be hunted by the sent, or followed by the print of his steps. The world shall not euer haue him in pal|pable view and full cry; by reason of his notorious and grosse impieties. If he can but now and then shoot in an instigation to some wickednes, it serues his turn. He doth not euery day sally out of his fort, and charge his enemies in the face; but watcheth opportunity, when his excursions may do most mis|chiefe. The <HI>Deuil</HI> may be within, though hee stand not at doore to be seene.</P>
<P N="6">6. Lastly <HI>Satan</HI> is said so far to be gone out, as there is an interruption in the soueraignty of sinne for a season. The flouds of iniquity are not so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">iolent, as if they were kept within the dam by shutting down the sluce. The <HI>Dromedary,</HI> the vngodly, runs not so madly, whiles that infernall rider forbeares their sides with his spurre.</P>
<P>As he is said to <HI>come in,</HI> when he was in before: because there commeth in a more forcible &amp; stron|ger illusion of <HI>Satan,</HI> the~ the hart erst suffred. Lu. 22. It is said, that <HI>Sata~ entred into Iudas</HI> before the <HI>Pass|ouer:</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 22. 3.</NOTE> yet we cannot thinke that Gods <HI>Spirit</HI> was in
<PB N="22" REF="15">
him before: but onely now a greater power of <HI>Sa|tan</HI> got in; that like a ripe tumour would bee no longer hid within the thinne skinne of hypocrisie. Corruption now gets eruption, and the rancorous vlcer of wickednesse bursts forth.</P>
<P>So of the contrary, <HI>Satan</HI> is said to <HI>go out,</HI> when he stil holds in; but like a bird in the net, that hangs by one claw. <HI>Nero</HI> is still in <HI>Rome,</HI> though he re|mittes taxations, and forbeares massacres for a sea|son. The loue of drunkennesse may be in the heart, though there be a day when the Tauerne is auoy|ded. Be the Adulterer asleepe, he is an adulterer still. What maister so cruell, but sometimes lets his slaue rest? <HI>Certa quiescendi tempor a fata dabunt.</HI> The Deuill is not continually impelling or com|pelling his seruants to publicke and notorious ini|quities. Sometimes he supends his tyranny, and sits close in the heart, banketting on the lusts which he findes there, and sends not abroad for new cates. The tempestuous wind eftsoone lyes still: the most robustious and malignant force of wickednes bates of the vsuall violence, and breaks not forth into the same shew of malice without some intermission. So farre as this suspense, remission, and interrupti|on of sinne extends, so farre is <HI>Satan</HI> said to be <HI>gone out.</HI></P>
<P>You see the <HI>Measure.</HI> Onely giue mee leaue, to set you downe two short rules, as two reflecting perspectiues; wherein you may behold, whether this <HI>vncleane spirit</HI> be truely, or hypocritically <HI>cast out</HI> of your hearts.</P>
<P N="1">1. So farre is <HI>Sathan cast out,</HI> as sinne is cast out.
<PB N="23" REF="15">
The tenure, whereby <HI>Satan</HI> holds any Lorshippe in the heart, is sinne: He that would ouerthrow his title, must labour an eiection of wickednesse. Piety in the heart, purity in the life, are true testimonies of the Deuils exile. <HI>Satan</HI> fights against vs with 2. weapons. 1. That he found in vs. 2. That he brings vpon vs. That he found in vs, is <HI>flesh</HI> and <HI>bloud:</HI> that he brings vpon vs, is <HI>death.</HI> By this latter he could not haue hurt vs, except wee had giuen him the former: and so reach'd him a weapon to pierce our owne hearts. In what measure <HI>sinne</HI> rules or is ruled: <HI>Satan</HI> is held in or eiected.</P>
<P N="2">2. The discontinuing of some sinnes, and retai|ning others giues no comfort or argument of <HI>Sa|tans departure.</HI> If he be truely <HI>gone,</HI> there comes in his place a perfect detestation, and resolute op|position against all sinne. It is in vaine to <HI>cast out Satan</HI> by auoiding auarice, when thou letst him in by a wastfull prodigality: to admit him by hypo|crisie, whom thou throwest out by profanesse. This is to put the <HI>Deuill</HI> out at the porch, and let him in againe at the posterne.

Our frailty giues the Deuill a presumptuous confidence of in|trusion.
<PB N="39" REF="23">
Hence he saith (not <HI>fortasse,</HI> but <HI>proul du|bio) I will returne.</HI> He thinkes we are too weake, to turne him away without his errand, when he comes with a picture of lust, a bag of gold, a staffe of office and promotion.

Or as the Statuary can make an Image, which the timber and axe could neuer haue effected without him.

<P>Such a course takes this malignant Physitian for the death of the soule; obseruing first when a de|light in any sinne cast vs downe: and then, when the faculties of our soules forbore their functions, in <HI>hungring after righteousnesse,</HI> or digesting the <HI>word</HI> of <HI>truth:</HI> and lastly, when hee hath found, which way our natural inclination is giuen, and the graine of our affections runs, he labours to helpe vs for|ward into the practicall custome of that wickednes.

<P N="3">3. Man is by <HI>Christ</HI> aduanced to that place, whence God disthroniz'd him. Now he cannot endure, that a humane creature should ascend to that heauen, whither himselfe (once an Angell) may not be admitted.</P>

<P>Hence he affects his old house: there hee is sure of good cheare and welcome: a fire of lust to warm him: a bed of vncleannesse to lodge him, and a ta|ble furnished with all manner of impieties to feast him.

<P>This is the effect of an ouerly and superficiall <HI>re|pentance:</HI> like a slight beesome, it sweepes away the dust and cobwebs, and such lighter stuffe, but the filth and dirt is caked and baked on.

<P>Sinne is congealed, concorporated, baked on; and must be pared and digged away by greater vi|olence then <HI>sweeping. Swept Satan</HI> yeelds it, so not pared. Impiety is habituated by custome, hardned

<P>How peruerse is their course and thought, that imagine, they may repent more in an houre, then they sinne in an age! As if, hauing in many yeares kindled a thousand fires, thou wouldst think to put them out all with one teare: whereas indeede, ma|ny teares can scarse put out one. Then boldly, staine the cloth a whole vintage, and at last let one wash|ing serue for all. Alas! man is quickly made mise|rable, but not with such speed happy. How easily, how suddenly got man his damnation: it was but eating an apple; soone done. <HI>Esau</HI> quickely hun|ted away his blessing, but could not with <HI>manie teares</HI> recouer it. <HI>Dauid</HI> is not long in falling, his ri|sing is tedious. With much paines and contention doth a man climbe vp some high Tower; but loo|sing his hold, he comes downe apace. It is no easy thing to stand, it is easie to slip, to stumble, to fall. The thicke and foggy aire of this sinfull world, as the smoake and stenchfull mistes ouer some popu|lous Cities, can soone fully the soule: the continu|all tramplings of sinne brings mire and dirte vpon the conscience: these corruptions are not so pre|sently rid away, as taken.</P>

<P>These <HI>hypocrites,</HI> being erst so themselues abused and deluded of <HI>Satan,</HI> perswade others to villany, by arguments of vertue.

<P>Three inferences from hence must not passe a|way vnobserued.</P>
<P N="1">1. That there is difference of sinnes, sinners, &amp; consequently of punishments. The first was said to be an <HI>vncleane spirit,</HI> yet are the latter <HI>seuen worse.</HI> By the witnesse of <HI>Christ</HI> we haue it already. Mat. 5. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 5, 22.</NOTE> and by his Iudgement shall finde it heereafter, that an <HI>angry</HI> affection is liable to <HI>Iudgement:</HI> a prouo|king <HI>gesture</HI> to the punishment of a <HI>Councel:</HI> but rai|ling inuectiues are worthy of <HI>hell-fire. Chorazin</HI> &amp; <HI>Bethsaida</HI> shal speed worse then <HI>Tyre</HI> and <HI>Sidon,</HI> and yet these were already in hel. <HI>The seruant that knowes his Maisters will, and doth it not, shal bee beaten with many stripes.</HI> Simple nescience hath an easier iudge|ment, then sinfull knowledge. If <HI>Barbaria</HI> wring her hands, that she hath knowne so little; <HI>Christen|dome</HI> shall rend her heart, that she hath knowne so much to so little purpose.</P>
<P>Parity of sinnes is an idle dreame: a <HI>Stoickc</HI> and <HI>Ioni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">an</HI> imagination. For though the <HI>wages</HI> of all <HI>sinne</HI> be <HI>euerlasting death;</HI> yet some sinnes shal feele the torments of that death more violent and terri|fying, then others. I haue other-where shewed, that <HI>Iudas</HI> his villany inbetraying his Master, was more horrible, then if a <HI>Barrabas,</HI> a notorious butcherer had done the deed.

<P>This <HI>Dauid</HI> instanceth, Psal. 1, 1. <HI>Blessed is he that hath not walked in the counsel of the vngodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sate in the chaire of the Scor|ner. Walking</HI> is bad enough, but it is worse to <HI>stand</HI> then to <HI>walke,</HI> and to <HI>sit</HI> then to <HI>stand</HI> in the waies of wickednesse. Though <HI>idle wordes</HI> be an <HI>vncleane spirit,</HI> yet actuall disobedience is a fouler Deuill.

<P N="2">2. God doth seuerely reuenge himselfe vpon <HI>Ingratitude</HI> for his graces: &amp; squares out his iudge|ment according to the proportion of the blessing conferred &amp; abused.

hell with the greater precipitation. This <HI>peiority</HI> of his <HI>state</HI> may be amplified in 6. respects.</P>
<P N="1">1. Whilst this <HI>blacke Deuil</HI> had a <HI>white</HI> face, &amp; car|ried the countenance of religion, he was wrap'd vp in the general prayers of the Church. He seemed of that number, for whom as the friends to <HI>christ,</HI> there was a continual remembrance in good mens inter|cessions. <HI>If any man see his brother sin a sin, which is</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Ioh. 5, 16</NOTE> <HI>not vnto death, he shal aske, and he shal giue him life for them that sin not vnto death. But there is a sinne vnto death: I do not say that he shal pray for it. Samuel</HI> will pray for <HI>Saul,</HI> till he perceiue that he hath giuen o|uer the Lord, and the Lord him.</P>
<P>But when the white scarffe is plucked off this <HI>Moores</HI> face, and his <HI>blacke</HI> leprosie appeares: when the Wolfes sheepskin is stripp'd off, and he is seene to worry the lambes: then is he singled out as an e|nemy to <HI>Christ,</HI> and Gods iudgement hastened on him at the intreaty of his seruants. He is so much the worse, as he hath lost the benefit of good mens prayers. When once in this <HI>gall of bitternesse,</HI> and <HI>bond of iniquity,</HI> in vaine <HI>Simon Magus</HI> requests <NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 8, 24.</NOTE> <HI>Simon Peter</HI> to request God for him. <HI>Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which yee haue spoken, come vpon me.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Whilst this <HI>blacke Deuil</HI> mantled his tawny skin, and vlcerous hart with dissimulation of piety, there was outwardly some hopefull likelihood of his re|formation, and winning to heauen.

God; the Minister did preach to him the tydings of peace with a good opinion, and admitted him to the communication of the <HI>Sacrament.</HI> But now, his eruption into manifest contempt of sacred things, and despite done to the <HI>spirit of truth,</HI> hath deaded that hope so that the Minister hath not that confident comfort, that the <HI>word</HI> will be the <HI>fa|nour of life</HI> vnto him. His <HI>Hypocrisie</HI> hath decei|ued the world; his <HI>Apostacy</HI> hath deceiued himselfe: therefore his <HI>state is worse.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. His <HI>latter end is worse</HI> in regard of <HI>him|selfe:</HI> and this may bee amplified in foure circum|stances.</P>
<P N="1">1. Before he was sicke of spiritual drunkennesse, now he is lethargiz'd. VVho knowes not that a continued lethargy is worse then a short ebriety Such is his <HI>state.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Impenitence hath brought him to impudence: and by often prostitution of his heart to vncleanes, he hath gotten a <HI>whores forehead,</HI> that <HI>cannot blush.</HI> Ier. 3. <HI>Thou refusedst to be ashamed.</HI> And Ier. 8. <HI>Were they ashamed when they had committed abhomination?</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ieremy 3, 3. 8. 12.</NOTE> <HI>Nay, they wer not at al ashamd, neyther could they blush.</HI> He hath so little repented for wickednes, that now he thinkes there is no wickednesse standeth in need of repentance. A brasen face, which no foule deed, nor reproofe for it, can make to change colour. How can it be otherwise? For a <HI>blacke Deuil</HI> can no more blush, then a blacke Dog.</P>
<P N="3">3. He is in <HI>worse state,</HI> by so much as a relapse is more perilous then the first sicknesse. By reason that strength is now spent, and nature made more
<PB N="74" REF="42">
weake, and vnable to helpe it selfe, or to receiue be|nefit by what is ministred. The sparlies of good|nesse are now dying, or quite extinct, &amp; the flouds of iniquity more violent against him. There be so|rer assaults, and lesse strength to encounter.</P>
<P N="4">4. Before he was quiet in himselfe, and might haue a flattering hope, that the night would neuer come. But now breaking forthinto palpable con|tempt and obduracy, he finds his conscience open to condemne him, and hell gates open to receiue him. His vlcer seemed to be fairely skinn'd ouer, and in his owne sense healed; but now to come to a new incision, is greater terror then euer. The sound of feare is now in his eares, the sense of a dagger at his heart. His body would, his mind can|not rest. The horror of future punishment lyes at <HI>Cain's</HI> doore, and is at euery noyse ready to wake. There is a fearefull conflict betwixt <HI>Sensuality</HI> and <HI>Reason</HI> in him: that he may vse <HI>Iobs</HI> words, though in a deeper and direr sense. <HI>Pactus sum mihimet</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob. 7. 20.</NOTE> <HI>ipse grauis: I am a burden and trouble to my selfe.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the great Parasite of the soule, that here|tofore matched the number of Gods threatnings with as many faire promises, &amp; flatter'd this wretch with the paucity of his sinnes; now takes him in the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">rch, and ouer rec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ons him. Hee that so long kept him in a beautifull gallery of hope, now takes him aside, and shewes him the darke dungeon of despaire. He engrosseth his iniquities in text-let|ters, and hangs them on the Curtaine at his beds f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">te, to the racking amasement of his distracted soule. Before the Deuill did put his shoulders vnder
<PB N="75" REF="42">
the burthen; but now he shifts it off, and impo|seth it on the sinner. And as I haue read, the Spa|nish <HI>Index</HI> deales with <HI>Velcurio:</HI> who commenting on <HI>Liui</HI> saith, that <HI>the fift age was decrepite vnder the</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ind.

<P>This ague, or rather agony, is made more vexing by the sting of conscience: which is now Gods bai|liffe to arrest him; his witnesse against him; his whip to lash him. His Register, that reades ouer the long booke of his offences; and after a terrible aggrauation of their heynousnes, tells him his pe|nance, direfull and intollerable; and that <HI>Coneordat cum actis Curiae,</HI> it agrees with the iust decree of Gods Court, neuer to be auoyded.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>His last state is worse</HI> then <HI>his first,</HI> in respect of God: who will now turne him out of his protecti|on. When he hath once proclaimed open warre and rebellion against God, and hath manifestly de|clared himself an outlaw; no maruell, if God throw him out of the circumference of his mercy, &amp; let his Prouidence take no charge ouer him; sauing one|ly to restraine his sauage fury, from forraging his grace-empaled Church. But for himselfe, the Scrip|ture giues a renunciation. <HI>If he will go into capti|uity, let him goe.</HI> Reuel. 22. 11. <HI>If he will be vntust, let him be vniust still. If he will be filthy, let him be filthy still.</HI> I will not hinder his course, <HI>Abea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">, pere|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">t, prafundat, perdat,</HI> said that father in the <HI>Comedy;</HI>
<PB N="76" REF="43">
Let him goe, perish, sinke, or swimme. He hath full liberty to swill the cup of his owne damnation vp to the brim.</P>
<P N="5">5. In respect of the Deuil, <HI>his latter state is worse.</HI> Which may be demonstrated by a familiar smili|tude. A man is committed to prison for debt, or some light trespasse; is there indifferently wel vsed, hath (for his money) all the liberty that the layle and layer can affoord him; nay, is permitted to go abroad with keepers. At last, he spies opportunity, and breaks away: then the layler fumes and fomes and rageth; and perhaps, sweares away that little share of his owne soule, which he had left. The prisoner had need looke to himselfe: if the layler catch him, he had better neuer haue stirr'd. At last he is taken; now bolts, and lockes, and heauy yrons, a strong guard, and a vigilant watch; til he be made safe for stirring againe. This bondage is far worse then the first.</P>
<P>The sinner in the deuils keeping is let alone to enioy the liberty of the prison, that is, this world; he may feed his eye with vanities, his hand with extor|tions, his belly with iunkets, his spleene with laugh|ter, his eares with musicke, his heart with iollity, his flesh with lustes; and all this without controll. But if he be wonne by the <HI>Gospell</HI> preached to break pri|son; and thereupon giue the deuill the slippe: let him take heed, <HI>Satan</HI> doe not catch him againe. If he once recouers him into his prison, he will dun|geon him; remoue from him all meanes, whereby he might be saued; let him see, heare, feele, vnder|stand nothing but temptations and snares; blinde
<PB N="77" REF="43">
his soule, harden his heart; loade him with heauy irons, and locke him vp in bolts and fetters of euer|lasting perdition.</P>
<P N="6">6. Then lastly, <HI>his end shal be worse at the last;</HI> when the least parcell of Gods wrath shall be hea|uier, then all the anguish he felt before. When his <HI>Almond</HI> tree shall be turned to his <HI>yron</HI> rod; his af|flictions to Scorpions. VVhen the short and mo|mentany vexations of this world shall no sooner cease to him, then the eternall torments of Hell shall begin, and (which is most fearefull) shall ne|uer end. Be his body burned to death in fire, yet those flames shall go out with his ashes: but come his flesh and soule to that infernall fire, and when they haue beene burned myriads of yeares, yet it shall not be quenched.</P>
<P>The <HI>Application</HI> doth immediately concerne the <HI>Iewes;</HI> which hath before beene plentifully in|stanced. For our selues. 1. The <HI>vncleane spirit</HI> hath by Gods holy <HI>Gospell</HI> beene cast out of vs. 2. Doe you thinke, he is at quiet? No: he esteemes al <HI>places dry</HI> and barren, till he get into vs againe. 3. He <HI>resolues</HI> to try for entrance. 4. Now is it e|nough, that we leaue ourselues <HI>empty</HI> of <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>good workes?</HI> for all our abhominable sinnes <HI>swepe</HI> with an ouerly <HI>repentance?</HI> and <HI>garnished</HI> with <HI>hy|pocrisie,</HI> and with our old <HI>affections</HI> to sinne still? 5. Take we heed; he will come with <HI>seauen spirits, more wicked</HI> then the former, and giue vs a fiercer as|sault.</P>
<P>But <HI>our helpe is in the name of GOD, who hath made heauen and earth:</HI> in whose mercy we trust, be|cause
<PB N="78" REF="44">
his <HI>compassions faile not.</HI> Our owne <HI>strength</HI> is no confidence for vs; but the grace of that <HI>stron|gest man,</HI> who is alone able to keepe out <HI>Satan.</HI> Let vs adhere to <HI>Him</HI> by a true <HI>faith;</HI> and serue <HI>him</HI> in an holy integrity of conuersation: and <HI>our latter end shall bee better</HI> then our <HI>beginning.

<HEAD>TO THE TRVE|ly vvorthy Gentleman M. HENRY FORTESCVE, <HI>Esquire, a fauourer of vertue</HI> and good Learning.</HEAD>
<P>_SIR, I haue put vp the <HI>VVolfe,</HI> though not <HI>hunted</HI> him; as iudg|ing my selfe too weake for that sport-earnest. It is no desert|lesse Office to discouer that subtle and insatiate Beast; to pull the Sheepe-skinne of Hypocrisie ouer his eares; and to expose his feming malice and sangui|sugous cruelty to mens censure and detestation. Let those hands strike him, that haue darts of authority put into their Quiuers. Our Land is no <HI>Forrest,</HI> literally or metaphorically vnderstood: but whether for <HI>Church</HI> or <HI>Common-wealth,</HI> profession or soile, an <HI>Orchard</HI> of Gods owne planting; fruitefull in goods and good workes. <HI>VVolues</HI> we haue none, but some <HI>Mystical</HI> ones; whose ferocity is yet hidden vnder the habites and
<PB REF="46">
cases of those <HI>Lambes,</HI> they haue deuoured. These I haue set in view, or at least meant my best to do it. I haue seldome pretended that common poyse, that (by their owne report) sets so many mad pens, like wheeles, a running, <HI>Importunacy</HI> of friends. I haue willing|ly published, what I had hope would do good published. Onely this I feared to keep from the Presse, lest it should steale thither another way. Being there, I could not with better confidence fasten vpon a knowne <HI>Patron,</HI> then your selfe: who can both vnderstand it, and will reade it: not onely the <HI>Epistle,</HI> but the whole <HI>Booke.</HI> Though that fashion with many patrons, of perusing more then their owne Titles, bee now as a Sute of the old make. I know you spend some houres of all dayes in such good exercises; abandoning those idle and exces|siue customes, wherein too many will please themselues, and none else.</P>
<P>It is an vnthrifty spending of time, and a sorry successe will conclude it, when we are curious in plotting a method for our inferior delights; and leaue our <HI>Sal|uation</HI> vnwrought vp. Wee striue to settle our Lands, to secure our monies, to confirme our estates; but to conforme our liues, or to make <HI>sure</HI> our <HI>Election</HI> is vi|lipended. And yet when all is done; braines haue plot|ted, meanes haue seconded, bonds and lawes haue esta|blished; nothing can be made <HI>Sure</HI> but onely our <HI>Sal|uation.</HI> But goe you forward to adorne your eternall mind; and to plant your soule full of those <HI>Flowers,</HI> which giue already a pleasant odour on earth, and shall one day be stucke like glories in Heauen. So shall your <HI>memory</HI> be sweet in the mouths and hearts of future generations; whiles the vicious, euen aliue, doe not e|scape

<BIBL>Luke 10. 3.</BIBL>
<Q>Behold, I send you forth as Lambes among Wolues.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE <HI>Great Bishop of our soules</HI> beeing now at the Ordination of his Mini|sters; hauing first instructed them <HI>in via Domini,</HI> doth heere discipline them <HI>in vita Discipuli:</HI> and pre-armes them to that entertainment, which the <HI>Samaritans</HI> of the world are likely to giue all those, whose <HI>faces looke toward Ierusalem.</HI> Math. 10. ver. 22. <HI>You shall bee hated of all men for my names sake.</HI> If they had but some opposers, there were some comfort; then it is probable that the rest would helpe: nay, <HI>All.</HI> Yet if they were but indifferently affected toward

vs, and would neyther defend nor offend. but re|signe vs vp to our selues: nay, they shall oppose, they will <HI>Hate:</HI> your <HI>persecutors shalbe in euery Citty,</HI> not few but many, not neuters but maligners. If there were many and not <HI>haters,</HI> then as it is in the Prouerbe, <HI>The more the merrier:</HI> if <HI>haters</HI> and not many, then <HI>the fewer the better cheare:</HI> but they are for nature persecutors; for number many me~, most men, innumerable, <HI>all men.</HI> But we are here <HI>praemo|niti,</HI> and therefore should be <HI>praemuniti:</HI> neyther need we grudge to suffer in measure for <HI>Him,</HI> that hath suffered beyond measure for vs. VVhatsoeuer we endure for his names sake, the patience and pas|sion of others hath matched it: but <HI>His</HI> greefe for vs could not be fitted with a <HI>Sicut</HI> in all the world.</P>
<P>But I would not, like a carelesse Porter, keepe you without dores, til you had lost your stomacks. There is some cheare coming, and I will now vn|locke the gates of my <HI>Text,</HI> to let you in to it.

<P>This is the Tree, and the branches: shall wee now steppe forward to gather and taste the fruite? But stay. Here is a Gardiner must first be spoke with: one that stands in the very entrance of my <HI>Text;</HI> for some purpose sure. <HI>Behold.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Behold,</HI> is like <HI>Iohn Baptist,</HI> in holy <HI>writte,</HI> euer|more the vant-currer of some excellent thing. <HI>Pon|tan:</HI> compares it to the <HI>sounding of a Trumpet, be|fore some great Proclamation.</HI> It is like the hand in the margine of a booke, pointing to some remark|able thing, and of great succeeding consequence. It is a Direct, a Reference, a dash of the <HI>Holy-Ghosts</HI> penne; seldome vsed repletiuely: but to impart &amp; import some speciall note, worthy our deeper, and more serious obseruation. It is like the ringing of the great Bell, before the Sermon of some famous Preacher; &amp; bids vs here, as a <HI>monitor,</HI> keep silence, to heare what the Eternall <HI>VVord</HI> speaketh vnto vs. In a word, it is but a word, and yet the <HI>Epitome</HI> of that whole sentence. <HI>Let him that hath eares to heare,
<PB N="5" REF="48">
heare:</HI> let him that hath eyes to see, <HI>Behold.</HI></P>
<P>Thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> was our Sauiour <HI>Christs Sermon ad Clerum;</HI> whose Pulpit is now in Heauen: and sends vs to preach on his preachings, to paraphrase his Le|ctures, and no more but to deliuer that to you, which he hath dictated to vs. Your attention is therefore charged in this <HI>Behold.</HI> Open your eares, those organical conduits of discipline: nay, your hearts are liable, and therefore should bee pliable to this charge. Keepe then patience in your minds, attention in your eares, meditation in your hearts, practise in your liues. <HI>Behold.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Behold</HI> what? S. <HI>Mathew</HI> recites this <HI>Deputation,</HI> together with a <HI>Direction. Behold, I send you forth as</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 10, 16.</NOTE> <HI>Lambes in the middest of Wolues: be ye therefore wise as Serpents, and harme-lesse as Doues.</HI> Where <HI>Christ</HI> doth not onely conferre a Charge, but inferre a Carriage. The former is <HI>Institutio viae,</HI> the other <HI>Instructio vitae. I send: Be you,</HI> &amp;c. The <HI>Deputation</HI> or designing their office, shall onely limit my speech, and your attention for this time. This Current parts it selfe into two rivulets, a <HI>Commission,</HI> a <HI>Com|mixtion.</HI> The <HI>Missure, I send you:</HI> the <HI>Mixture, as Lambes among wolues.</HI> Euery <HI>Commission,</HI> consists on necessity, besides the meere act, of at least two persons, the <HI>Sender,</HI> the <HI>Sent.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Sender,</HI> may be consider'd his <HI>Greatnesse,</HI> his <HI>Goodnesse.</HI> His <HI>Greatnesse</HI> that he can <HI>send:</HI> his <HI>goodnes,</HI> that he wil <HI>send,</HI> for the benefit of his <HI>church</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. His <HI>Greatnesse.</HI> The <HI>Sender</HI> is greater then the person <HI>Sent:</HI> as <HI>Paul</HI> saide in a shallower inequality of <HI>Melchisedech</HI> &amp; <HI>Abraham,</HI> being both men. <HI>Heb. 7
<PB N="6" REF="49">
Without al contradiction, the lesse is blessed of the grea|ter.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hebr. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE> Here the <HI>Sender</HI> is God and man: a King, the King; of pure, absolute, and independant authori|ty: a <HI>reall</HI> Prince, a <HI>royall</HI> Prince. <HI>Reall</HI> in his right, in his might: <HI>Royall</HI> in his affects and effects: hee purposeth, and disposeth good to his <HI>Church.</HI> Ty|rants are the Kings of slaues: liberall Princes are the Kings of men: <HI>Christ</HI> is the King of Kings: here dispatching his <HI>Legates</HI> on an Ambassage to the world. This his <HI>Greatnesse.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. His <HI>Goodnesse:</HI> he that is King doth send to his subiects, abiects; or rather to rebels, to make them subiects: with a pardon of all their treasons, ready signed and sea'ld to their accepting hands. Ephes. 4. 8. <HI>When he had led captiuity captiue, he gaue gifts vnto men. When hee had ledde captiuity captiue;</HI> there's his <HI>Greatnes: he gaue gifts vnto men;</HI> there's his <HI>Goodnesse.</HI> By the former he is <HI>mirificans: mi|tificans</HI> by the latter. Behold; he must <HI>send</HI> to vs: we knew not, desired not accesse to him. He is <HI>the way, the truth, the life:</HI> and therefore <HI>sends</HI> out these as describers of the <HI>way,</HI> dispensers of the <HI>truth,</HI> co~|ductors to the <HI>life.</HI> If the <HI>way</HI> had not found vs, wee should neuer haue found the <HI>way.</HI> Here then is his <HI>Goodnesse;</HI> though a King, yet hee preacheth him|selfe, and sends Preachers. As was <HI>Solomon,</HI> his type; both a <HI>King</HI> ouer <HI>Israel,</HI> and a <HI>Preacher</HI> to <HI>Israel.</HI> Time was; <HI>Christ</HI> refused to be a King, denyed to be a Iudge, but vouchsafed to be a Preacher. VVith|out this sweet dignation to vs, we shold neuer haue ascended to him, <HI>nec opibus, nec operibus, nec opera:</HI> neyther by our wealth, nor by our worth, nor by

our wils, nor by our workes, nor by our wits, nor by our worship. Thus for the <HI>Sender.</HI>
<Q><L><HI>In a</HI> Messenger sent</L></Q></P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>VVherefore.</HI> Good reason: he that <HI>sends</HI> the~ forth was a <HI>Lambe.</HI> Iohn 1. <HI>Behold the Lambe of God that taketh away the sinnes of the worlde.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>the</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn 1, 29.</NOTE> <HI>Lambe, that Lambe of God,</HI> euen from his owne bo|some: <HI>taking away the sinne of the world.</HI> Other Le|uiticall <HI>Lambes tooke away sinne</HI> typically; this real|ly. They were slaine for the sins of the <HI>Iewes,</HI> this of all the <HI>world.</HI> There is <HI>tacita antithesis in</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">. <HI>Christ</HI> was a <HI>Lambe,</HI> (that we may take with vs our Precedent) especially in three respects. Of his <HI>In|nocency, Patience, Profite.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. For his <HI>Innocency,</HI> Ioh. 8. <HI>VVhich of you can con|uince</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 8, 46,</NOTE> <HI>me of sinne?</HI> You may reproue, can you dis|proue?

But he was <HI>Agnus ille immaculatus.</HI> 1. Pet. 1. 19. <HI>A lambe,</HI> that <HI>lambe</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Pet. 1, 19.</NOTE> <HI>without blemish, without spot.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="53">
A Sunne without a mote, a rose without a canker, a cleare heauen without any cloud.</P>
<P N="2">2. For his <HI>Patience.</HI> Esay 53. <HI>He was oppressed, he was afflicted, yet hee opened not his mouth: hee is</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay 53, 7.</NOTE> <HI>brought as a Lambe to the slaughter; and as a sheep be|fore the shearer is dumbe, so openeth he not his mouth.</HI> First, the shearers fleece him, and then the butchers kill him, yet he <HI>opens not his mouth:</HI> to wit, against them, but for them. <HI>Father forgiue them, they know not what they doe.</HI> He wrote that in the dust, which many engraue in brasse and marble; wrongs. Be|hold, the King of heauen is <HI>factus in terris,</HI> &amp; <HI>frac|tus in terris:</HI> yet calls not fire from heauen to con|sume his enemies: but quencheth that fire with his owne blood by them shedde; which they in shed|ding it had kindled against themselues. It is pro|bable, that some of the agents in his death, were sa|ued by his death. O strange inuersion, wrought by mercy; that <HI>Iniusti in homicidio,</HI> should be made <HI>Iusti per homicidium;</HI> and that the <HI>bloud,</HI> which was scarce washed from their guilty hands, should now whiten their consciences. Like that impostum'd Souldior; the blow that was thought to haue kill'd him, cur'd him.</P>
<P N="3">3. For his <HI>Profite.</HI> He was <HI>profitable</HI> in his fleece, <HI>profitable</HI> in his flesh, <HI>profitable</HI> in his blood, in his life, in his death, and after death eternally <HI>profita|ble.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. His <HI>Flesh</HI> is <HI>meat indeed;</HI> though <HI>non dentis, sedmentis. Our fathers did eate Manna,</HI> which was the food of Angels, as it were; and yet dyed cor|porally: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 6, 19.</NOTE> but whosoeuer <HI>eate</HI> the God of Angels
<PB N="15" REF="53">
spiritually, shall not dye eternally.</P>
<P N="2">2. His fleece good. We were cold, and naked. Is this all? Nay, and polluted too. The <HI>fleece</HI> of his imputed <HI>Righteousnes,</HI> keeps vs warme, cloaths our nakednesse, hides our vncleannesse. Hence the <HI>Prophet</HI> calls him, <HI>The Lord our righteousnesse.</HI> Ours not inherent, but imputatiue. 2. Cor. 5. 21. VVe are made no otherwise <HI>the righteousnesse of God in him,</HI> then he was made <HI>sinne for vs:</HI> which was onely by imputation. So Luther, <HI>Christiana sanctitas non est actiua, sed passiua sanctitas: extra nos est iustitia nostra, non in nobis.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. His <HI>bloud</HI> excellent, and of most transcendent vertue; whether <HI>lauando,</HI> or <HI>leuando:</HI> we were <HI>macu|lati, et mactati:</HI> speckled with corruptions, dead in sinnes. Not onely as the <HI>Remists</HI> say, <HI>Diseased:</HI> but as <HI>Paul</HI> saith, <HI>Deceased:</HI> Ephe. 2, 1. <HI>Dead in sinnes and trespasses.</HI> His <HI>bloud</HI> hath recouered our life, our health; and washed vs as <HI>white,</HI> as <HI>the snow i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> Salmon.</HI> Thus he is in euery respect <HI>profitable</HI> to vs; more then we could eyther <HI>expetere,</HI> or <HI>expectare;</HI> deserue, or desire. <HI>Satan</HI> is against vs: behold <HI>Christ</HI> is with vs; <HI>and wee ouercome him by the bloud of the</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Reuel. 12, 11.</NOTE> <HI>Lambe.</HI></P>

<P N="2">2. Time and your expectation call me to the <HI>In|nocency</HI> of these <HI>Lambes.</HI> It is not enough for them to suffer wrongs: but they must offer none.

<P>It is no wonder, if those <HI>lambes</HI> be stricken, that strike. He that will be an agent in wrongs, must be a patient.

Especially (blame me not, if I be) loth to come <HI>among the wolues:</HI> whereupon, by the next point of my <HI>Text,</HI> and last I purpose now to handle, I am enforced to venture. Of the <HI>Wolfe</HI> I must speak: but I hope it cannot bee said, <HI>lupus in fabula:</HI> there are any such present to heare me.</P>
<P>This is the <HI>Description</HI> of those, among whom the <HI>Lambes</HI> are sent. There is a naturall antipathy of these, one against another; euer since God put <HI>emnity,</HI> an irreconcilable hatred and contrariety, betweene the <HI>seed</HI> of the <HI>Woman</HI> and of the <HI>Serpent.</HI> I haue read, that a string made of <HI>Wolues</HI> guts, put amongst a knotte of strings made of the guttes of sheepe, corrupts and spoiles them all. A strange secret in nature: and may serue to insinuate the ma|lice of these <HI>Lycanthropi</HI> against <HI>Lambes:</HI> that they do not onely persecute them liuing, but euen infest them dead.</P>
<P>No maruell then, if the <HI>lambes</HI> care not greatly for the company of <HI>wolues.</HI> For if one scabbed
<PB N="23" REF="57">
sheepe infect the whole flocke for <HI>morality:</HI> what will one <HI>wolfe</HI> doe among the <HI>lambes</HI> for <HI>mortality!</HI> Therefore so farre as we may, let vs flye the society of <HI>wolues. VVith the mercifull thou shalt shew thy selfe</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 18, 25.</NOTE> <HI>mercifull, &amp;c.</HI> Therefore with the <HI>Poet;</HI> flye wic|ked company, <HI>et te melioribus offer.</HI> But how can this be, when we are sent as <HI>Lambes in medio lupo|rum?</HI> The <HI>lambe</HI> would not willingly be alone: yet is farre better when solitary, then in <HI>woluish</HI> society. <HI>Plutarch</HI> speakes of certaine Law-giuers, that wold haue their Priests abstaine from Goats: a luxurious beast, and making men by contact obnoxious to E|pilepsie. (As the <HI>Iewes</HI> were commanded in <HI>Leuiti|cus,</HI> to abstaine from <HI>vncleane</HI> things.) Though we cannot escape the company of <HI>wolues:</HI> let vs abhor <NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 5, 10.</NOTE> all participation of their vices.</P>
<P>The holy word of God, who can giue most congruous names to natures, often compares the wicked to brute and sauage creatures. God doth not onely send reasonable <HI>man,</HI> to learne wisedome of the vnreasonable beast. So he school'd <HI>Israel</HI> by the <HI>Oxe, Balaam</HI> by his <HI>Asse;</HI> and <HI>Solomon</HI> sends the <HI>Sluggard</HI> to the <HI>Pismire.</HI> For it is certaine, that many beasts exceed man in diuers naturall facul|ties: as the dog in smelling, Hart in hearing, Ape in tasting, &amp;c. But he matcheth degenerate man with beasts of the most notorious turpitudes.</P>
<P>The proud enemies of the <HI>Church</HI> are called <HI>Ly|ons.</HI> Psal. 58. <HI>Breake out the great teeth of the young</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 58, 6. Psal. 80, 13.</NOTE> <HI>Lyons, O Lord.</HI> Wilde Boares. Psal. 80. <HI>The Boare out of the wood doth waste it: and the wilde beast of the field deuoures it.</HI> Buls. Psal. 22. <HI>Many buls haue com|passed</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 22, 12.</NOTE>
<PB N="24" REF="58">
<HI>me: strong Buls of Bashan haue beset me round.</HI> And in the same <HI>Psalme; Vnicornes.</HI> The <HI>Bull</HI> hath 2. hornes, the <HI>Vnicorne</HI> one. The roaring <HI>Bull,</HI> (I had almost said the roaring Boy) the swaggering Ruffi|an hath two hornes; <HI>Ishmaels</HI> tongue, and <HI>Esau's</HI> hand: with one horne wounding our bodies and estates, with the other our good names. The <HI>Vni|corne,</HI> that's the <HI>Hypocrite,</HI> the fowle-brested, fayre crested, factious Puritaine hath but one horne: but therewith he doth no smal mischiefe. This <HI>Vnicornes</HI> horne might bee very good, if it were out of his head: but so long as it is there, it hurts rather.</P>
<P><HI>Dauid,</HI> Psal. 32. compares refractary men to <HI>hor|ses</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 32, 9.</NOTE> <HI>and mules; which haue no vnderstanding: whose mouth must be held in with bitte and bridle, lest they come neere vnto thee.</HI> The <HI>Mule,</HI> if you heed not, will take his rider in his teeth, and lay him in the manger. And the <HI>Horse,</HI> when hee hath cast his loade, giues him a kind farewel with his heeles. Ex|perience iustifieth this truth amongst vs: for many of our Parishioners are so full of Iadish qualities, that the poore Minister can hardly keepe his sad|dle.</P>
<P>Sometimes we haue the wicked likened to fowles There is the <HI>Peacocke,</HI> the <HI>proud</HI> man, stretching out his painted and gawdy wings. The desperate <HI>Cock,</HI> the <HI>contentious,</HI> that fights without any quarrell. The house-bird, the <HI>Sparrow,</HI> the Embleme of an incontinent and hote <HI>adulterer.</HI> The <HI>Lap-wing,</HI> the <HI>Hypocrite;</HI> that cryes, <HI>here t'is, here t'is:</HI> here's holi|nesse: when he builds his nest on the ground; is earthly minded; and runnes away with the shell on
<PB N="25" REF="58">
his head; as if he were <HI>perfect,</HI> when he is not be|gunne. There is the <HI>Owle,</HI> the night-bird, the Ie|suited Seminary; that sculkes all day in a hollow tree, in some Popish vault; and at euen howtes his masses, and skreeks downefall and ruine to King, Church, and Common-wealth. There is the <HI>Batte,</HI> the <HI>Neuter;</HI> that hath both wings and teeth, and is both a bird and a beast; of any religion, of no re|ligion. There is the Cormorant, the Corne-vo|rant; the Mire-drumble, the <HI>Couetous:</HI> that are euer rooting and rotting their hearts in the mire of this world. There is also the <HI>vulture,</HI> that followes armies to prey vpon dead corpses: the <HI>vsurer</HI> that waites on Prodigalls, to deuoure their decaying fortunes. Some haue in them the pernicious na|ture of all these foule fowles.</P>
<P>VVe may say of a wicked man, as their Schoole|glosse saith of their Soule-Priests. <HI>Malus Presbiter aequiparatur Coruo, in nigredine vitiorum, in rauce|dine vocis, in voracitate oblationum mortuorum, in foetore spiritus, in garrulitate, et in furto.</HI> Such a man is resembled to a Rauen; in the blacknesse of his vi|ces, in the hoarcenesse of his voyce, in his insatia|ble voracity, in his stench of breath, in his tatling garrulity, and in theft.</P>
<P>VVee finde the wicked otherwhiles compared to <HI>Dogs.</HI> Psal. 22. <HI>Dogs haue compassed me.</HI> And ver. 20. <HI>Deliuer my soule from the sword, and my darling from</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 22, 16.</NOTE> <HI>the power of the Dog.</HI> And Psal. 59. <HI>They returne at E|uening: they make a noyse like a Dog, &amp; go round about</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 59, 6.</NOTE> <HI>the City.</HI> Saith <HI>Paul,</HI> Philip. 3. <HI>Beware of Dogs,</HI> &amp;c. eyther grinning in malice, or barking with repro|ches, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Philip. 3. 2.</NOTE>
<PB N="26" REF="59">
or biting with mischiefe.</P>
<P>There is the great Mastiffe, the <HI>vsurer;</HI> that worryeth all the <HI>lambes</HI> in a Country. The Bloud|hound, the malicious <HI>Murderer,</HI> that kills any man which angers him; relying on a friend in the Court for pardon. There is the nimble Beagle, the cun|ning <HI>Persecutor;</HI> that hath alwayes the innocent in the winde. The proud Gray-hound, the gay Gal|lant, that out-runnes all moderation. The fawning Spaniell, the flattering <HI>Sycophant,</HI> that hath onely learn'd to fetch and carry; to spring the Couey of his maisters lusts, and to arride, and deride him. You haue also Setters, Quicke-setters I should say, that vndoe the Countrey by making Commons seue|rall. You haue your trencher-dogs, lazie Seruitors, that do nothing, but eate, drinke, play, and sleepe. There be Tumblers too, luxurious Scortators, and their infectious harlots. Some haue yard-<HI>dogs,</HI> chur|lish Porters, to keepe the poore away from their gates. And there be bawling Curres, rurall igno|rants, that blaspheme all godlines vnder the name of Puritanisme.</P>
<P>To come home, there bee <HI>wolues</HI> euery where in abundance. I doe not meane literally those, who~ the Greekes call <GAP DESC="foreign">: whereof I haue read in diuers stories. And more authentically reported by Doctor <HI>Ioseph Hall,</HI> in his short Epistolicall dis|course of his Trauels, to abound in <HI>Ardenna;</HI> called by the Inhabitants <HI>Lougarous;</HI> in English, <HI>VVitch|wolues;</HI> witches that had put on the forme of those cruell beasts. <HI>Aristotle</HI> in his second booke of the nature of beasts, saith that in <HI>India</HI> is a <HI>wolfe,</HI> that
<PB N="27" REF="59">
hath 3. rowes of teeth aboue, hath feet like a Lyon, face like a man, and the tayle of a Scorpion: his voice like a mans voice, and shrill as a Trumpet: and is <GAP DESC="foreign">, as these <HI>wolues</HI> are.</P>
<P>But mysticall <HI>wolues:</HI> rauenous in the formes of men: hauing a greater similitude to <HI>wolues</HI> in the disposition of their minds, then dissimilitude in the composition of their bodies. The wicked haue ma|ny resemblances to <HI>wolues.</HI> Desire of breuity shall reduce them to foure. <HI>Sterrillity, ferocity, voracity, subtlety.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. For <HI>Sterrillity.</HI> The <HI>wolfe</HI> is not very fertile in producing the one kind: (if lesse, better.) But vt|terly vnprofitable in any good thing redounding from him. The horse carrieth his Maister, the oxe is strong to draw the plough, the sheepe giues vs wooll for warmth, and flesh for nourishment, the Cowes vdder drops milke into our pailes. The Ele|phant hath vertue in his tooth, the Vnicorne in his horne, the Ciuet-cat in her sent, the Goate in his blood, the Beuer in his genitals. The dogge hath his seruice, and the catte keepes away vermine: not the ape, but makes some sport; and the very poyson of serpents is by art made medicinall. For hyde, or haire, or horne, or hoofe, or blood, or flesh, most beasts yeeld some profite; but the <HI>wolfe</HI> is good for nothing.</P>
<P>A fitte Embleme of a wicked man; that is vni|uersally euill whiles he liues: and not often doth so much good as a hogge when he dyes. Onely death hath bound him to the good forbearance, and re|straines him from doing any further mischiefe. Per|haps
<PB N="28" REF="60">
he may giue away some fragments in his Te|stament: but he parts with it in his will, against his will: and it is but a part, whereas <HI>Iudas</HI> returned al, yet went to hell. The <HI>wolfe</HI> liuing is like <HI>Rumney Marsh. Hyeme malus, aestate molestus, nunquam bonus.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Liberts Pe|ramb. <HI>of</HI> Kent.</NOTE> Tide and time, morning and euening, winter and summer, neuer good. Thus euery way is this <HI>wolfe infructuous.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. For <HI>Ferocity.</HI> The <HI>wolfe</HI> is sauage and cruell; and loues to licke his owne lippes, when they reeke with the luke-warme goare of the <HI>lambes.</HI> There is no such complacency to the wicked, as the wrea|king their malicious teenes on the good. If they cannot reach with their clawes, they vomite out fire, or at least smoke. <HI>Omnis malitia cructat fumum.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fulgent.</NOTE> The tongue of such a <HI>wolfe</HI> is often like a warre-ar|row, which doubly hurts where it lights. It wounds the flesh in going in, and it rends it worse in pulling out. This is the <HI>arrow they make ready on the string, to shoote priuily at the vpright in heart.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalme 11, 2.</NOTE></P>
<P>Their <HI>atrocity</HI> is not thus satisfied; but if oppor|tunity giue power, they will wound and <HI>worry</HI> the <HI>lambes</HI> first, and proclaime their guiltinesses after|wards. As <HI>Cyrill</HI> obserues, the <HI>lambe of God</HI> was ser|ued by the <HI>Iewes. Prim&ugrave;m ligant; deinde causas in eum</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">In Ioh. lib. 12. cap. 45.</NOTE> <HI>quaerunt.</HI> First they binde him, and then they seeke matter against him. As it is reported of a Iudge of the Stemery at <HI>Lydford</HI> in Deuonshire; who hauing hangd a felon among the Tinners in the forenoon, sate in iudgement on him in the afternoone. So the <HI>wolues</HI> in Queen <HI>Maries</HI> daies, imprisoned the inno|cent <HI>lambs</HI> that had broken no law; and afterwards
<PB N="29" REF="60">
deuised a law to conde~n them. And hauing first mar|tyrd the~, then held disputation whether the act were authenticall. These were the sanguisugous <HI>wolues, Papists.</HI> There are still <HI>rapidi, rabidi lupi,</HI> that must haue somwhat to expiate their sauage fury. <HI>Auicen</HI> speaks of the <HI>wolfe;</HI> that if the Fishermen leaue him no offall, he wil rend their nets. These <HI>Canibals</HI> look for somwhat; if it be but for a <HI>Ne noceant.</HI> Other <HI>wolues</HI> are afraid of burning flames: but these <HI>Lycan|thropi</HI> budge not an inch for all the fire in hell.</P>
<P N="3">3. For <HI>voracity.</HI> The <HI>wolfe</HI> is rauenous of al beasts; especially the she-<HI>wolfe,</HI> when she hath a litter: and eates the very earth when she hath no other prey, saith <HI>Isiodore.</HI> These mysticall <HI>wolues</HI> rob the Mini|sters, &amp; take away the <HI>portion of their meate,</HI> as <HI>Mel|zar</HI> did from <HI>Daniel,</HI> though against our wils; and force vs to liue with <HI>pulse &amp; water-gruell.</HI> They loue to haue the Priest look through a Lattice; &amp; would be loth, all his meanes should keepe his house from Dilapidations. The maine policy &amp; piety of many, that would seeme to be most religious &amp; pure, con|sists in plotting and parlying how to lessen the Cler|gymans estate. They grudge not the Merchants wealth, nor enuy the ditation of Lawyers, nor hin|der the enriching of Physitians. These occupations prouide for their bellies, their bodies, their estates. But (as if all were more precious then their soules) their whole labor is to deuoure the Ministers due, and to begger him. I could tel them what <HI>Paul</HI> saith, <HI>If wee haue sowne to you spirituall thing, is it a great thing if we shall reape your carnall things?</HI> but these <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 9, 11.</NOTE> haue no faith in the <HI>Scriptures.</HI> They are very hot
<PB N="30" REF="61">
for the Gospell, they loue the Gospell: who but they? Not because they beleeue it, but because they feele it: the wealth, peace, liberty that ariseth by it.</P>
<P>To cousen the Ministers of their tythes in pri|uate; or to deuoure them in publicke, and to iusti|fie it when they haue done, and to haue the wrested law taking their parts. (But alasse! how should it be otherwise, when it is both Iudges and Iurors owne case too often!) to laugh at the poore Vicar, that is glad to feed on crusts, and to spinne out 20. markes a yeare into a threed as long as his life; whiles the <HI>wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">fe</HI> innes a Crop worth three hundred pound <HI>per annum:</HI> this is a prey somewhat answe|rable to the <HI>voracity</HI> of their throats. Let euery ma~, of what profession soeuer, necessary or superfluous; be he a member or scabbe of the Common wealth, liue: so the Priest be poore, they care not.</P>
<P><HI>Aristotle</HI> saith, that when <HI>wolues</HI> goe out of their dennes to prey; they first sharpen and whet their teeth with <HI>Origanum,</HI> or wilde Margerom. Before these <HI>wolues</HI> speake in publike, or conferre in priuate, theyedge their tongues against the Cler|gy: and like the mercilesse Spaniards to the Indi|ans, they will set them a great deale of worke, and but a little meate. Let them preach their hearts out: for they will see their hearts out, ere they restore them ought of their owne.</P>
<P>Goe to thou <HI>wolfe:</HI> put that thou hast robbed the <HI>Minister</HI> of into the Inuentory of thy goods: it shall be grauell in thy throat, hookes in the bellies of thy posterity, and ingender destruction to al the
<PB N="31" REF="61">
rest. <HI>Aristotle</HI> saith, that the wooll of that sheepe which was deuoured by a <HI>wolfe,</HI> infecteth and an|noyeth the wearer. So the goods stolne from the Minister, though neuer so closely, is an infectious contagion, and a deuouring pestilence to thy bo|dy, to thy state, to thy conscience; and will bring all thou hast to confusion. The world sayes now, <HI>Alasse poore Lambe:</HI> It shall say one day, <HI>Alasse poore VVolfe;</HI> how art thou caught in the snares of Hell! Meane time they lye in the bosome of the <HI>Church;</HI> as that disease in the brest, call'd the <HI>Cancer,</HI> vulgar|ly the <HI>wolfe:</HI> deuouring our very flesh, if wee will not pacifie and satisfie them with our substance.</P>
<P N="4">4. For <HI>Subtlety.</HI> The Foxe is admired for craft: but he hath not stolne all from the <HI>wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">fe.</HI> It is ob|serued of <HI>wolues,</HI> that when they goe to the fold for prey, they will be sure to aduantage themselues of the winde. And <HI>Solinus</HI> reports of them, that they hide themselues in bushes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> thickets, for the more suddaine and guilefull preying vpon Goates and sheepe. These <HI>Lycanthropi</HI> in our times doe more hurt by their <HI>subtlety,</HI> then by their violence. More is to be feared their <HI>pax, quam fax: malitia, quam militia. Beware of them which come to you in sheepes</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 7, 15.</NOTE> <HI>cloathing, but inwardly are rauening wolues.</HI></P>
<P>They haue outsides of <HI>Christianity,</HI> but insides of rapine. <HI>Intus, linum subtilitatis, extra lanam simplici|tatis</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Greg. Mag. Tertull.</NOTE> <HI>demonstrant.</HI> Saith <HI>Tertullian. Quaenam sunt istae pelles ouium, nisi Christiani nominis extrinsecus superficies?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hic dolus est magnus, iupus est qui creditur agnus.</HI> If you take a <HI>wolfe</HI> in a <HI>lambe-</HI>skinne, hang him vp,
<PB N="32" REF="62">
for he's the worst of the generation.</P>
<P>You will aske how we should know them. A <HI>wolfe</HI> is discerned from a sheepe, by his howling, and by his clawes; <HI>tanquam ex vngue leonem.</HI> For the how|ling of these <HI>wolues;</HI> you shall heare them barking at the Moone, rayling, reuiling, swearing, blasphe|ming, abusing, slandering: for this is a <HI>woluish</HI> lan|guage. For their clawes. Mat. 7, 16. <HI>By their fruites</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 17. 15. <HI>Anselm.</HI></NOTE> <HI>you shall know them. Etsi non ex omnibus fructibus, tamen ex aliquibus cognoscetis eos.</HI></P>
<P>Their <HI>woluish</HI> nature will burst forth to their owne shame, &amp; the abhorring of all men. Thus saith <HI>Me|lancthon. Ex malo dogmate, et ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">is moribus dignosce~|tur.</HI> You see the nature of these <HI>wolues.</HI> O that they would consider it, that haue power to menage the~: that they would protect the <HI>lambes;</HI> and as we haue detected their enemies, so punish them. Muzzle the <HI>wolues,</HI> that they may not deuoure the flocks: giue them their chaine and their clog; binde them to the good behauior toward the Minister; and restraine their violences. <HI>Wolues</HI> flye him that is annointed with the oyle of Lyons. If Magistrates would vse that sword, which the <HI>Lyon,</HI> the King hath put into their hands, to Gods glory, the <HI>wolues</HI> would be in more feare and quiet.</P>
<P>Let him that hath <HI>Episcopall</HI> Iurisdiction con|sider what S. <HI>Bernard</HI> writes to <HI>Eugenius:</HI> that it is his office, <HI>Magis domare lupos, qu&agrave;m dominari ouibus.</HI> And as they say, the Subiect of the <HI>Canon</HI> law is, <NOTE PLACE="marg">De Consider. lib. 2.</NOTE> <HI>Homo dirigibilis in Deum, et in bonum commune:</HI> so that Court, which is called <HI>Forum spirituale,</HI> should specially consider the publike tranquillity
<PB N="33" REF="62">
of these <HI>Lambes,</HI> &amp; to eneruate the furious strength of <HI>wolues.</HI></P>
<P>Let them that are deputed Superuisors of Pa|rishes, Church-wardens; remember that nothing in the world is more spirituall, tender, and delicate, then the conscience of a man: and nothing bindes the conscience more strongly then an oath. Come ye not therefore with <HI>Omne ben&egrave;,</HI> when there are so many <HI>wolues</HI> among you. If you fauour the <HI>wolues,</HI> you giue shrewd suspition, that you are <HI>wolues</HI> your selues. Is there nothing for you to present? Gods house, Gods day is neglected: the Temples vnre|paired, and vnrepaired too: neyther adorned, nor frequented. Adultery breaks forth into smoke, fame, infamy. Drunkennes cannot find the way to the Church, so readily as to the Alehouse: and when it comes to the Temple, takes a nap iust the length of the Sermon. And yet <HI>Omnia ben&egrave; still.</HI> Let me say; <HI>Security</HI> and <HI>Partiality</HI> are often the Church-war|dens: <HI>Conniuence,</HI> and wilfull <HI>Ignorance</HI> the Side|men. You wil say, I take for the profit of the Com|missary. I answere in the face and feare of God; I speake not to benefit his Office, but to discharge my owne office.</P>
<P>VVhen all is done, and yet all vndone still, the <HI>lambs</HI> must be patient, thogh <HI>in medio luporu~.</HI> God wil not suffer our labors to passe vnrewarded. <HI>Emit|tuntur, non amittuntur agni.</HI> VVhen we haue <HI>finished our course,</HI> there is <HI>laid vp for vs a crown of righteous|nes, which the Lord, the righteous Iudge shal giue vs at</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Tim. 4, 8.</NOTE> <HI>the last day.

If the Tempest comes, call on him with <HI>Peter, Lord saue vs;</HI> and he will <HI>rebuke the windes and the Seas;</HI> they shal not hurt you. <HI>Storme and tempest,</HI> winds and waters obey his voyce.

Decline them so well as you may; and consider what Prouidence guides your course: this <HI>Sea</HI> is <HI>Before</HI> Gods <HI>Throne.</HI> Keepe you the Cape of <HI>good Hope</HI> in your eye: and what euer becomes of this weake Vessell, your <HI>Body;</HI> make sure to saue the Pas|senger, your <HI>Soule,</HI> in the day of the Lord <HI>Iesus.</HI> What is here directed you, shall be faithfully prayed for, by him</P>

<Q>Before the Throne there was a Sea of Glasse like vnto Chrystall.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_I Haue chosen a member of the <HI>Epi|stle</HI> appointed by our Church to be read in the celebration of this <HI>Feast</HI> to the most <HI>Sacred Trinity.</HI> There is <HI>One sitting on the Throne,</HI> which is <HI>God</HI> the <HI>Father:</HI> on his <HI>right hand</HI> the <HI>Lambe which was slaine, onely worthy to vnseale the Booke,</HI> which is <HI>God</HI> the <HI>Sonne:</HI> and <HI>seauen Lampes of fire burning before the Throne,</HI> the seauen-fold <HI>Spirit,</HI> which is <HI>God</HI> the <HI>Holy Ghost. Vnus potentialiter, trinus personaliter.</HI> Which blessed <HI>Trinity</HI> in <HI>Vnity,</HI> and <HI>Vnity</HI> in <HI>Trinity</HI> inspire mee to speake, and you to heare. <HI>Amen. Before the Throne</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="66">
The <HI>Reuelation</HI> is a booke of great depth; con|taining <HI>tot Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">menta, quot verba;</HI> as many won|ders <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ieron. Ep. Paulin.</NOTE> as words, mysteries as sentences. There are other bookes of the Gospell; but <HI>Bullinger</HI> cals this <HI>Librum euangelicissimum,</HI> the most Gospel-like <NOTE PLACE="marg">In. Ipoc. con. 61</NOTE> booke, a booke of most happy consolation: deliue|ring those euentuall comforts, which shall succes|siuely and succesfully, accompany the <HI>Church</HI> vnto the end of the world. It presents, as in a perspec|tiue glasse, the <HI>lambe of God</HI> guarding, and regar|ding his <HI>Saints:</HI> &amp; giuing them triumphant victory ouer all his and their enemies. The <HI>writings</HI> of S. <HI>Iohn,</HI> as I haue read it obserued, are of three sortes. He teacheth in his <HI>Gospell</HI> especially <HI>Faith;</HI> in his <HI>E|pistles loue; hope</HI> in his <HI>Reuelation.</HI></P>
<P>This last (as of great consolation, so) is of great difficulty. There is <HI>Manna</HI> in the <HI>Arke,</HI> but who shall open it to vs? Within the <HI>Sanctum Sancto|rum</HI> there is the <HI>Mercy-seate;</HI> but who shall draw the Curtaine for vs, pull away the <HI>veile?</HI> Our <HI>Saui|our</HI> lies here; (not dead, but liuing) but <HI>who shal roll away the stone for vs;</HI> open a passage to our vnder|standing? The impediment is not <HI>in Obiecto perci|piendo,</HI> but <HI>in Organo percipiendi;</HI> not in the obiect to be seene, but in our organ or instrument of see|ing it: not in the <HI>Sunne,</HI> but in the dimme thicknes of our sight. God must say vnto vs, as the <HI>man</HI> of God spake to <HI>Eli</HI> in the name of <HI>Iehouah.</HI> 1. Sam. 2. <HI>Reuelando reuelaui &amp;c. I haue plainely appeared vnto the house of thy father.</HI></P>
<P>For my owne part, I purpofe not to plunge to the depth with the <HI>Elephant;</HI> but to wade with the
<PB N="3" REF="66">
<HI>lambe</HI> in the shallowes: not to be ouer-ventrous in the <HI>Apocalypse,</HI> as if I could reueale the <HI>Reuelation:</HI> but briefely to report what expositions others haue giuen of this branch: and then gather some fruite from it, for our owne instruction and comfort. Be|ing bold to say with S. <HI>Agustine,</HI> whosoeuer heares me, <HI>vbi pariter certus est, pergat mecum; vbi pariter</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 1. de Trin. cap. 3.</NOTE> <HI>hasitat, quarat mecum; vbi errorem suum cognoscit, redeat ad me: vbi meum, reuocet me.</HI> If he be cer|taine with me, let him go on with me: if he doubt with me, let him seeke with me: if he finde out his owne error, let him come vnto me: if mine, let him recall me.</P>
<P>VVith purpose of auoiding prolixity, I haue limited my selfe to this member of the 6. <HI>ver. And before the Throne there was a sea of glasse like vnto Chrystall.</HI> I finde hereof seauen seuerall expositi|ons. I will lightly touch them, and present them onely to your view; then build vppon the soun|dest.</P>
<P N="1">1. Some expound this <HI>glassy</HI> and <HI>Chrystal-like Sea,</HI> of <HI>Contemplatiue</HI> men: so <HI>Emanuel Sa.</HI> But I find this foundation so weake, that I dare not set any frame of discourse on it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Some conceiue it to be an abundant <HI>vnder|standing</HI> of the <HI>Truth;</HI> a happy and excellent know|ledge, giuen to the <HI>Saints;</HI> and that in a wonderfull plentitude: so <HI>Ambrose. Per mare historica, per vi|trum moralis, per Chrystallinum spiritualis intelligen|tia.</HI> By <HI>Sea</HI> is intended an <HI>historicall knowledge;</HI> by <HI>glasse</HI> a <HI>morall;</HI> a <HI>spirituall</HI> and supernaturall by <HI>Chrystall.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="4" REF="67">
3. Some vnderstand by this <HI>glassy Sea-like Chry|stall,</HI> the <HI>Fulnesse</HI> of all those guifts &amp; graces, which the <HI>Church</HI> deriues from <HI>Christ. In him dwels all ful|nesse:</HI> yea so aboundant is his <HI>oyle of gladnesse,</HI> that it runnes (as it were) ouer the verges of his <HI>humane nature,</HI> vnto the <HI>skirts of his clothing;</HI> plentifully blessing his whole <HI>Church.</HI> Thus it is conceiued by <HI>Brightman.</HI> As if this <HI>mare vitreum</HI> were an <HI>anti-type</HI> to that <HI>mare fusum:</HI> spoken of 1. Kings 7. <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 King. 7, 23.</NOTE> this <HI>glassy sea,</HI> to that <HI>molten sea.</HI> Among other admirable works of that heauen-inspired King. ver. 23. <HI>Hee made a molten sea, ten cubites from the one brimme to the other: it was round all about, and his height was fiue cubites: and a line of thirty cubites did compasse it round about, &amp;c. It contained two</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">ver 26.</NOTE> <HI>thousand Baths.</HI> The end why it was made, and vse for which it serued, you shall finde, 2. Chron. <NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Chro. 1, 6.</NOTE> 4. <HI>The sea was for the Priests to wash in.</HI> Now this might well seeme to prefigure some great <HI>pleni|tude.</HI> For otherwise, for <HI>Aaron</HI> and his sonnes to wash in, <HI>Exiguus aliquis vrceolus vel guttulus suf|fecisset:</HI> some cruet, bason, or lauer might suffici|ently haue serued.</P>
<P N="4">4. Some intend this <HI>glassy sea, like to Chrystall,</HI> to signifie <HI>Coelum Chrystallinum,</HI> the Chrystalline heauen: which they affirme to bee next vnder that heauen of heauens, where the eternall God keepes his Court, and sits in his <HI>Throne.</HI> And somwhat to hearten the probability of this opinion; it is saide here, this <HI>Sea is before the Throne.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Some expositions giue this <HI>sea</HI> for the Gos|pell. And their opinion is probably deduced from the two attributes, <HI>Glassy</HI> and <HI>Chrystalline.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="5" REF="67">
1. The first expresseth <HI>perlucidam materiem,</HI> a bright and cleare matter. Which sets a difference betwixt that <HI>legall,</HI> and this <HI>Euangelicall Sea.</HI> That was <HI>ex aere constatum,</HI> which is <HI>densa et opaca mate|ries:</HI> of <HI>molten brasse,</HI> which was a thicke, duskish, and shaddowy matter; not penetrable to the sight. This is <HI>mare vttreum, a Sea of glasse;</HI> more cleare, perspicable, and transparent. That was a <HI>Sea</HI> of <HI>Brasse,</HI> this of <HI>Glasse.</HI> In which disparity this latter farre transcends the former. So that if <HI>Dauid</HI> saide, Psal. 84. <HI>How amiable are thy Tabernacles, oh Lord of Hostes! My soule longeth, yea euen fainteth for the</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalme 84, 1.</NOTE> <HI>Courts of the Lord:</HI> speaking but of that <HI>Legal Sanc|tuary;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 9, 1.</NOTE> which was adorned with those <HI>Leuiticall</HI> Or|dinances, and <HI>Typicall</HI> Sacrifices: How much more cause haue we to reioyce with <HI>Peter</HI> &amp; those two <HI>brethren,</HI> Mathew 17. to see <HI>Iesus Christ trans|figured in the Gospell: his face shining as the Sunne,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mathew 17, 1</NOTE> <HI>and his rayment white as the light?</HI> Being not come to the <HI>Mount</HI> of terror, full of <HI>blacknesse, and dark|nesse,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">, 18.</NOTE> <HI>and tempest;</HI> whereat euen <HI>Moses</HI> himselfe did exceedingly <HI>feare and quake.</HI> But <HI>vnto Mount Sion, vnto the City of the liuing God, the heauenly Ie|rusalem, and to an innumerable company of Angels.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">ver. 22.</NOTE> <HI>To the generall assembly and Church of the first borne, which are written in heauen, &amp;c.</HI> The greater glo|ry giues <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s the greater ioy. For, saith Saint <HI>Paul</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 3, 9.</NOTE> sweetly, <HI>If the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousnesse ex|ceed in glory.</HI> They saw <HI>(Christum velatum,</HI> we <HI>reuela|tum) Christ</HI> shadowed in the law, we see him mani|fested in the <HI>Gospel. Great, without controuersie, is the</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 3, 16</NOTE>
<PB N="6" REF="68">
<HI>mystery of godlines: God manifested in the flesh, iusti|fied in the Spirit, &amp;c.</HI> They saw <HI>per fenestram,</HI> wee <HI>sine medio:</HI> they darkely through the windowes, we without interposition of any cloud. Great then is the difference betweene that figuratiue <HI>molten sea of brasse,</HI> and this bright <HI>glassy sea</HI> of the Gospell.</P>
<P>This <HI>Glasse</HI> liuely represents to vs our selues, and our Sauiour. Our selues wicked and wretched, <HI>dam|natos priusqu&agrave;m natos,</HI> condemned before we were borne: sinfull, sorrowfull: cast downe by our owne fault, but neuer restore-able by our owne strength: without grace, <HI>without Christ, without hope, without God in the world.</HI> Our Sauiour descending from <NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 2, 12.</NOTE> heauen to suffer for vs; ascending to heauen to pro|uide for vs: discharging vs from hell by his suffe|rings, and interessing vs to heauen by his righte|ousnesse. Oh looke in this blessed <HI>Glasse,</HI> and <HI>Be|hold the Lambe of God taking away the sinne of the</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 1, 29.</NOTE> <HI>world.</HI> Looke in it againe, and behold all the spots and blemishes in your owne consciences: as you would discouer to your eye any blot on your face, by beholding it reflected in a materiall glasse. See, contemplate, admire, meditate your owne misery, and your Sauiours mercy, in this <HI>Glasse</HI> presented.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Chrystalline</HI> is the other attribute: which is not <HI>idem significans,</HI> but <HI>plenioris, nec non planioris virtutis:</HI> not signifying the same thing, but of a ful|ler and plainer vertue, or demonstration. <HI>Chrystal|lum est quasi expers color is, accedens proxime ad puri|tatem a&euml;ris. Chrystall</HI> is described to bee (as it were voide of colour, as comming next to the simple purity of the ayre. Now as the other attribute
<PB N="7" REF="68">
takes from the <HI>Gospell</HI> al <HI>obscurity:</HI> so this takes from it all <HI>impurity.</HI> There is no humane inuentions, carnall traditions, or will-worship mixt with this <HI>Sea:</HI> it is pure as <HI>Chrystall. Abundant plagues</HI> shal be <HI>added</HI> to him, that shall <HI>adde to this Booke:</HI> and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Reue. 22, 18.</NOTE> his <HI>part</HI> shall bee <HI>taken away out of the booke of life,</HI> that shall sacrilegiously <HI>take ought from it.</HI></P>
<P>Let me say: God beholds vs through this <HI>Chry|stall, Iesus Christ;</HI> and sees nothing in vs leane, lame, polluted, or ill-fauour'd. What euer our owne proper, and personall inclinations and inquinati|ons haue beene, this tralucent <HI>Chrystall,</HI> the merits and righteousnesse of our Sauiour presents vs <HI>pure</HI> in the eyes of God. Through this <HI>Chrystall Christ</HI> himselfe beholds his <HI>Church;</HI> and then saith: <HI>Thou art all faire, my Loue, there is no spot in thee.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cant. 4, 7.</NOTE></P>
<P N="6">6. There is a sixt opinion. Some by this <HI>glassy</HI> and <HI>Chrystall-sea,</HI> conceiued to be meant <HI>Baptisme.</HI> Prefigured by that <HI>Red sea.</HI> Exod. 14. To which <HI>red sea Paul</HI> alludes in the point of <HI>Baptisme.</HI> 1. Cor. 10. <HI>I would not haue you ignorant, how that all our fa|thers</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 10, 1, 2.</NOTE> <HI>were vnder the Cloud, and al passed through the Sea. And were al baptised vnto Moses in the Cloud, and in the Sea.</HI> Of this minde are <HI>Augustine. Trac|tat.</HI> 11. in Ioh. <HI>Rupertus. Euthymius.</HI></P>
<P>The accordance of the <HI>Type</HI> and <HI>Anti-type</HI> stands thus. As none of the children of <HI>Israel</HI> entred the terrestriall <HI>Canaan,</HI> but by passing the <HI>redde Sea:</HI> so ordinarily, no <HI>Christian</HI> enters the celestiall <HI>Canaan,</HI> but through this <HI>glassy Sea.</HI> The <HI>Lauer of regene|ration</HI> is that <HI>Sea,</HI> wherein we must all wash. <HI>Verily, verily, I say vnto thee:</HI> (He said so, that could tell;
<PB N="8" REF="69">
and he doubles his asseueration) <HI>except a man bee borne of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn 3, 5.</NOTE> <HI>kingdome of God.</HI> Ordinarily, no man comes to heauen dry-shod: hee must wade through this ford. The Minister must <HI>irrigare.</HI> 1 Cor. 3. <HI>Iohn Baptist</HI> must powre on <HI>water:</HI> and <HI>Christ</HI> must <HI>Christen</HI> vs <HI>with the Holy Ghost and with fire.</HI> There must bee a <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mathew 3, 11</NOTE> <HI>washed</HI> body, a <HI>clensed</HI> conscience. This is that the <HI>Apostle</HI> calls <HI>pure water.</HI> Heb. 10. <HI>Let vs draw neere with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, ha|uing</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 10, 22.</NOTE> <HI>our hearts sprinkled from an euill conscience, and our bodies washed with Pure water.</HI> So let vs <HI>draw neere:</HI> without this no daring to approach the <HI>Throne</HI> of <HI>grace.</HI> Through this <HI>Sea</HI> we must all saile, the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> being our Pilot, the <HI>word</HI> of <HI>God</HI> our Compasse; or how should we thinke to land at the hauen of heauen!</P>
<P N="7">7. Lastly others affirme, that by this <HI>glassy Sea</HI> is meant the <HI>World.</HI> So <HI>Bullinger,</HI> &amp;c. This being the most generall and most probable opinion, on it I purpose to build my subsequent discourse. A spe|ciall reason to induce me, (as I think, the best light to vnderstand the <HI>Scripture</HI> is taken from the <HI>Scrip|ture:</HI> and as God best vnderstands his owne mea|ning, so he expounds it to vs by conferring places difficult with semblable of more facility) I deriue from <HI>Reuel.</HI> 15. verse 2. <HI>I saw as it were a Sea of glasse mingled with fire, and they that had gotten the victory</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Reuel. 15, 2.</NOTE> <HI>ouer the beast, and ouer his image, and ouer his marke, and ouer the number of his name, stand on the sea of glasse, hauing the harpes of God.</HI> Where the <HI>Saints</HI> hauing passed the dangers of the <HI>glassy sea,</HI> all the
<PB N="9" REF="69">
perils and terrors of this brittle and slippery <HI>World:</HI> and now setting their triumphant feete on the shores of happinesse; they sing a victorious song. <HI>Great and maruellous are thy workes, Lord God Al|mighty, iust &amp; true are thy wayes, thou King of Saints.</HI> Praising God with <HI>harpes</HI> and <HI>voices</HI> for their safe waftage ouer the <HI>sea</HI> of this <HI>World.</HI></P>
<P>Now for further confirmation of this opinion, in the 3. <HI>verse,</HI> the exultation which they sing, is called the <HI>song of Moses the seruant of God.</HI> So that it seemes directly to answere in a sweet allusion, to the deliuery of <HI>Israel</HI> from the <HI>Egyptians.</HI> At what <NOTE PLACE="marg">Exodus 14.</NOTE> time the diuided waters of the <HI>redde sea</HI> gaue them way; standing vp as a wall on their right hand, and a wall on their left; and that so long, till the little ones, and the women with childe might passe ouer dry-shod. But at last returning to their old course, swallowed vp their pursuers. Immediately here|on, Exodus 15. <HI>Moses</HI> and all <HI>Israel</HI> turning backe to behold the <HI>Egyptians</HI> drown'd in the <HI>sea,</HI> or flo|ting on the waues, whiles themselues stood secure on dry land; they sung a <HI>song</HI> to the <HI>LORD.</HI> The Children of <HI>Israel</HI> hauing passed the <HI>redde sea,</HI> sing a <HI>song</HI> to the <HI>LORD:</HI> the children of GOD ha|uing past the <HI>glassy sea</HI> sing a song also; and this lat|ter song is called by the name of that first, euen the <HI>song of Moses.</HI></P>
<P>So that the <HI>Analogy</HI> stands thus. 1. The <HI>redde sea</HI> was a type of this <HI>glassy sea, the VVorld.</HI> 2. The olde <HI>Israelites</HI> of the new and true <HI>Israelites,</HI> the <HI>Faithfull.</HI> 3. The <HI>Egyptians</HI> of all wicked perse|cutors and enemies of Gods Church. 4. <HI>Canaan</HI> the
<PB N="10" REF="70">
Land of promise, of <HI>Heauen</HI> the Land of purchase, which <HI>Christ</HI> bought for vs at so great a price. Our Aduersaries like theirs, our dangers like theirs, our waftage like theirs: but the <HI>Countrey</HI> we saile to, far transcends that earthly <HI>Canaan.</HI> That did but flowe with <HI>milke</HI> and <HI>hony</HI> for a time: this with infinite ioy, and illimited glory for euer. Against this con|struction it is obiected.</P>
<P N="1">1. This <HI>Sea</HI> is before the <HI>Throne:</HI> how can the <HI>World</HI> be so said? <HI>Answ.</HI> Properly: to shew that all things in the World are not subiect to fortune, but gouern'd by <HI>Him that sits on the Throne.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>world</HI> is rather thicke and muddie: how can it be called <HI>Chrystall? Answ.</HI> Fitly: not in regard of the owne nature; for so it is polluted: but <HI>respe|ctu Intuentis,</HI> in regard of God that beholds it: who sees all things done in it so clearely, as in <HI>Chrystall.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Allegorie</HI> then giues the <HI>World</HI> 1. for a <HI>Sea.</HI> 2. for a <HI>Sea</HI> of <HI>glasse.</HI> 3. Like to <HI>Chrystall.</HI> 4. Lastlie, it is <HI>before the Throne.</HI> Two of the circumstances concerne the <HI>world in thesi,</HI> two in <HI>hypothesi.</HI> It is described <HI>taliter</HI> and <HI>totaliter:</HI> simply, and in refe|rence. <HI>Simply,</HI> what it is in it selfe. <HI>In reference,</HI> what it is in respect of God.

<P>The <HI>World</HI> is not a materiall, but a <HI>Mysticall Sea.</HI> Time was, that the whole <HI>world</HI> was a <HI>Sea.</HI> Gen. 7. <HI>The waters preuailed exceedingly vpon the earth, and</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen 7. 19, 20.</NOTE> <HI>all the high hils, that were vnder the whole Heauen, were couered.

Sometimes it <HI>swels</HI> with <HI>Pride,</HI> as the <HI>Sea</HI> with waues; which <HI>Dauid</HI> saith, <HI>mount vp to heauen.</HI> Behold that <HI>Babilonian Lucifer,</HI> saying, <HI>I will exalt</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalme 107.</NOTE> <HI>my throne aboue the stars of God.

Especially the <HI>proud</HI> man, like the <HI>Sea,</HI> swels if the <HI>Moone</HI> inclines, if his Mistris grace him.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Vaineglory</HI> is the winde, that raiseth vp the billowes of this <HI>Sea.</HI> The off spring of the reuiued <NOTE PLACE="marg">Genesis 11.</NOTE> world are erecting a turret, whose battlements were meant to threaten heauen.

<P N="3">3. The <HI>World</HI> like the <HI>sea,</HI> is blew with enuy, li|uid with malice. It is the nature of <HI>worldlings</HI> to ouer-vexe themselues at the succesfull fortunes of others. God must do nothing for another man, but his <HI>euill eye</HI> thinkes himselfe wrong'd. He repines at that shower, which fals not on his owne ground. The <HI>pretions balmes</HI> distill'd from heauen on neigh|bours <HI>breake</HI> the <HI>malicious mans head.</HI> Hee hath in him no honesty, but especially wants an honest eye. He wounds himselfe to see others healed. Ney|ther are the blowes, he giues his owne soule, transi|ent flashes, or lashes that leaue no impression be|hind them: but markes that he carries with him to his graue: a leane, macilent, affamished body; a soule selfe beaten blacke and blew.</P>
<P N="4">4. Sometimes it boyles with <HI>wrath:</HI> and herein the <HI>world</HI> and the <HI>sea</HI> are very semblable. A mad &amp; impatient element it is; how vnfit to figure man! Ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> such is his indignation; if in the rage and fury of the <HI>sea</HI> there be not more mercy.</P>
<P>There is a time when the <HI>sea ceaseth from her raging:</HI> but the turbulent perturbations of this
<PB N="14" REF="72">
passion in the <HI>world</HI> continue without remission or interruption. The <HI>angry</HI> man is compared to a Ship sent into the <HI>sea quae Daemonem habet gubernator<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">m;</HI> which hath the Deuill for the <HI>Pilot.

But we say of many, as <HI>Va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">er. Max.</HI> of <HI>Sylla: It is a question, whether they or their anger dye first:</HI> or whether death preuents them both together. If you looke into this trou|bled <HI>Sea</HI> of <HI>anger,</HI> and desire to see the Image of a <HI>man:</HI> behold, you finde fiery eyes, a faltring tong, gnashing teeth, a heart boyling in brine, and dry|ing vp the moysture of the flesh; till there be scarse any part lest of his right composition. The tumul|tuous rage of the <HI>world</HI> so reekes with these passi|ons, that the company of those men is as ominous and full of euill bodings, as the foming <HI>Sea.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. The <HI>Sea</HI> is not more deepe then the <HI>World.</HI> A bottomlesse subtlety is in mens hearts, and an honest man wants a plummet to sound it. Pollicy and Piety haue parted company; and it is to be fea|red, they will hardly euer meete againe. He is coun|ted a shallow fellow, that is, as the <HI>Scripture</HI> com|mends <HI>Iacob, a plaine man, dwelling in tents.</HI> New deuices, trickes, plots, and stratagoms are only in <NOTE PLACE="marg">Genesis 25, 27</NOTE> request. Doe you not know the reason hereof? The <HI>world</HI> is a <HI>Sea;</HI> and in this <HI>Sea</HI> is <HI>plaine-dealing</HI> drown'd.</P>
<P N="6">6. There is foming luxury in this <HI>Sea:</HI> a cor|rupt and stinking froth, which the <HI>world</HI> casts vp. The steame of <HI>lust</HI> in this <HI>mare mortuum</HI> fumes per|petually; poysons the ayre we breathe; and like a

thicke fogge, riseth vp to heauen, as if it would ex|hale vengeance from aboue the clouds. This spumy fome is on the surface of the <HI>world,</HI> and runnes like a white leprosie ouer the body of it. Commend the <HI>world,</HI> ye affecters and affected of it: there is a <HI>fome</HI> that spoiles the beauty. Praise it no further then <HI>Naaman</HI> was, 2. King. 5.

The <HI>world</HI> you say, is <HI>spa|ciosus, speciosus;</HI> beautifull, bountifull; rich, delight|full: But it is <HI>leprous.</HI> There is a <HI>Sed</HI> to it: a filthy <HI>some</HI> that defiles it.</P>
<P N="7">7. The <HI>world,</HI> as the <HI>Sea,</HI> is a swallowing Gulfe. It deuoures more then the <HI>Sea</HI> of <HI>Rome:</HI> yea, and will deuoure that to at last. It swallowes those that swallow it: and will triumph one day with insulta|tion ouer the hugest Cormorants, whose gorges haue bene long ingurgitated with the <HI>world; In vis|ceribus meis sunt: They are all in my bowels.</HI> The Gentleman hath swallowed many a poore man: the Merchant swallowes the Gentleman: &amp; at last this <HI>Sea</HI> swallowes the Merchant. There are foure great deuourers in the <HI>world, Luxury, Pride, Glutto|ny, Couetousnesse.</HI> The <HI>Prophet I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">l</HI> speakes of foure horrible destroyers. <HI>That which the Palmer worme</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioel. 1, 1.</NOTE> <HI>hath left, hath the Locust eaten: that which the Locust hath left, hath the Canker-worme caten: and that

which the Canker-worme hath left, hath the Caterpil|ler eaten.</HI> The <HI>Palmer</HI> is <HI>Luxury:</HI> the <HI>Locust Pride:</HI> the <HI>Canker Gluttony:</HI> and you all know that the <HI>Ca|terpiller</HI> is <HI>Couetousnesse. Luxury,</HI> like the <HI>Palmer,</HI> swallowes much in the <HI>world:</HI> that which <HI>luxury</HI> leaues vnspent, <HI>Pride</HI> the <HI>locust</HI> deuoures: the scraps of <HI>Pride,</HI> the <HI>Canker Gluttony</HI> eates, and the frag|ments of all the former, the <HI>Caterpiller Couetousnesse</HI> soone dispatcheth. These be the <HI>worlds</HI> foure wide|throated <HI>Swallowers.</HI></P>
<P>These circumstances haue demonstrated (the first instance of this comparison) the tumultuous <HI>turbulency</HI> of the <HI>world.</HI> There be many other resem|blances of it to the <HI>Sea.</HI></P>

Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of Aspes within him.</HI> He that swims in a full <HI>sea</HI> of ri|ches, and is borne vp with whole flouds of delights, is but like a Sumpter-horse, that hath carried the Trunkes all day, and at night his treasure is taken from him, and himselfe turned into a foule stable; perhaps with a gall'd back. The rich <HI>worldling</HI> is but a hir'd Porter, that carries a great load of wealth on his weary backe all his day, till he grone vnder it: at night, when the Sun of his life sets, it is taken from him; and he is turn'd into a foule stable, a squallid graue: perchance with a gall'd shoulder, a raw and macerated conscience.</P>
<P>Say, the delights of this <HI>world</HI> were tollerably sweet; yet eue~ this makes them <HI>bitter,</HI> that the swee|test ioyes of eternity are lost by ouer-louing them. There was a <HI>Romane,</HI> that in his will bequeathed

a Legacie of a hundred Crownes to the greatest foole.

All men consented, that he was the greatest foole. If such a Legacie were now giuen, the Heires neede not trouble themselues in scrutiny: there be fooles enough to be found euery where: euen so many, as there bee <HI>worldlings:</HI> that refusing the honors of heauen, and the riches of glory, turne Hog-keepers, nay rather Hogges; rooting in the earth, and eating huskes.</P>
<P>But how <HI>bitter,</HI> saltish, and vnsauourie soeuer the <HI>Sea</HI> is, yet the Fishes that swim in it, exceeding|ly like it.

(And what should a <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">od</HI> serue for, but to please children and fooles?) Heereupon they refused to pay the

<P>Well yet, as salt and bitter as this <HI>Ocean</HI> the <HI>world</HI> is, there is some good wrought out of this ill. That supreme and infinite goodnesse deswades his Chil|dren from affecting it, by their experienced tart|nesse of it. So the Nurse embitters the dugge, when she would weane the Infant.

<P>Oh the shrill cry of our Land for this sinne, and the loud noise it makes in the eares of the Lord of Hoasts!

<Q>Before the Throne there was a Sea of Glasse like vnto Chrystall.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_IF I haue beene somewhat long on the <HI>Sea,</HI> you will excuse me. It is a great and vaste Element to trauell ouer in so short a time. Some Ob|seruations I haue giuen you; that I might not crosse the <HI>World</HI> with|out some fruite of my voyage. Onely what I haue spoken of the <HI>waters,</HI> let it not be drown'd in the <HI>wa|ters,</HI> as the prouerbe saith; not perish in your me|mories, without some fruite in your liues.</P>
<P>The next circumstance giues the <HI>world,</HI> not on|ly for a <HI>Sea,</HI> but <HI>Mare vitreum, a Sea of glasse.</HI> You see, I must carry you further on this Element, and yet at last leaue many coasts vnuisited, much smo|therd

in silence. Let not all be <HI>via nauis,</HI> as the <HI>Wise man</HI> speaketh, the <HI>way of a Ship on the sea,</HI> lea|uing no tracke or print in your meditations.</P>
<P>This <HI>glassy</HI> attribute shall giue vs obseruable <HI>three</HI> properties in the <HI>world. 1. Colour. 2. Slipperinesse. 3. Brittlenesse.</HI> As certainely as you finde these qua|lities in <HI>Glasse,</HI> expect them in the <HI>world.</HI>
<Q><L>Colour.</L></Q></P>
<P>There is a <HI>Glassy colour</HI> congruent to the <HI>Sea.</HI> So <HI>Virgil</HI> insinuates, describing the <HI>Nereades,</HI> certaine <HI>marine Nymphs.</HI>

<P>All the beauty of <HI>Glasse</HI> consists in the <HI>Colour:</HI> and what in the <HI>world,</HI> that is of the <HI>world,</HI> is com|mendable, <HI>praeter Colorem,</HI> besides the <HI>Colour?</HI> A Cottage would serue to sleepe in, as well as a sump|tuous Pallace, but for the <HI>colour.</HI> Russets bee as warme as silkes, but for the glistering <HI>Colour.</HI> The <HI>Egyptian bondwoman</HI> giue as much content, as Queene <HI>Vashti,</HI> but for the <HI>colour.</HI> The beauty of the fairest woman is but skin-deep: which if <HI>nature</HI> denies, <HI>arte</HI> helpes them to lay on <HI>colours.</HI> And when they are most artificially complexion'd, they are but walking and speaking pictures. It is the <HI>colour</HI> of
<PB N="40" REF="85">
gold, that bewitcheth the auarous: the <HI>colours</HI> of lewels, that make the Ladies proud. If you say, these are precious and comfortable in themselues: then feed on them; and try, if those mettals can (without meate) keepe your life and soule together.</P>
<P>The truth is: mans corporall eye sees nothing but <HI>colour.</HI> It is the sole indefinite obiect of our sight, whither soeuer we direct it. We see but the <HI>lay-part</HI> of things with these opticke organs. It is the vnderstanding, the soules interiour eye, that con|ceiues and perceiues the latent vertues. All that we outwardly behold, is but the fashion of the <HI>world:</HI> and S. <HI>Paul</HI> saith, <HI>The fashion of the world perisheth.</HI> The <HI>colour</HI> fades, and the splendor of things is de|cayed. <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 7, 31.</NOTE> That if the <HI>world,</HI> like aged and wrinckled <HI>Helen,</HI> should contemplate her own face in a <HI>glasse;</HI> she would wonder, that for her beauties sake <HI>Troy</HI> should be sack'd and burn'd: mans <HI>soule</HI> endanger'd to eternall fire.</P>
<P>Oh how is the splendor and glory of the <HI>world</HI> bated &amp; empair'd since the originall creation! The skye lookes dusky: the Sunne puts forth a drowsie head: as if he were no longer, as <HI>Dauid</HI> once descri|bed him, like <HI>a Bride-groome comming out of his cha~|ber, or a strong man reioycing to runne his race.</HI> The <NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 19, 5.</NOTE> Moone lookes pale, as if she were sicke with age: and the starres do but twinckle; as if they were dim, and look'd vpon the earth with spectacles. The <HI>Co|lours</HI> of the <HI>Rain-bow</HI> are not so radiant: &amp; the whole earth shewes but like a garment often dy'd, desti|tute of the natiue hew.</P>
<P>It is but <HI>colour,</HI> that delights you, ye <HI>worldlings:
<PB N="41" REF="85">
Esau</HI> lusts for the <HI>pottage,</HI> because they looke <HI>redde:</HI> and the drunkard loues the wine, because it lookes <HI>redde,</HI> and <HI>sparkles</HI> in the cup. Prou. 23. <HI>Looke not thou vpon the wine when it is redde, when it giueth his</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Prou. 23, 31.</NOTE> <HI>colour in the cup, when it moueth it selfe aright.</HI> VVhat babes are we to bee taken with these <HI>colours,</HI> that onely please the eye, or the sensuall part of man, &amp; harme the soule? like children, that play with <HI>Glasse,</HI> till they cut their fingers.</P>
<P><HI>Auicen</HI> saith, that <HI>glasse</HI> among stones, is as a foole amongst men. For it takes all paint, and fol|lowes precious stones in <HI>colour,</HI> not in vertue. So does this <HI>world</HI> giue <HI>colours</HI> to her riches, as if there were some worth and vertue in them: till wee are cosen'd of heauenly and substantiall treasures by o|uer prizing them. No matter (saith <HI>Isiodore)</HI> is more apt to make mirrors, or to receiue painting then <HI>Glasse.</HI> So men de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ke the <HI>world,</HI> as the <HI>Israelites</HI> did their <HI>Calfe:</HI> and then superstiously dote vpon it, as <HI>Pigmalion</HI> on his carued <HI>Stone.</HI></P>
<P>But can <HI>colour</HI> satisfie? Is mans imaginatiue pow|er so dull and thicke, as to be thus pleased? Shall a man toyle to dig a pit, and laboriously draw vp the water; and then must he sitte by, and not drink? or drinke, and not haue his thirst quenched? Yes. Thus do we long after earthly things, which obtai|ned giue vs no full content: thus disregard spiritu|all and heauenly; whereof but once rafting, we go away highly satisfied. Say then with <HI>Bernard.</HI></P>

<P>The decay of the parts argues the dotage of the whole. <HI>Aetna, Pernassus, Olympus</HI> are not so visible, as they were. The <HI>sea</HI> now rageth where the ground was dry: and fishes swimme, where men walked. Hilles are sunke, flouds dryed vp, rockes broken, townes swallowed vp of earth-quakes: plants lose their force, and planets their vertue. The Sunne stoopes like an aged man; as weary of his course, and willing to fall asleepe. All things are subiect to violence and contrariety; as if both the Poles were ready to ruinate their climates. <HI>The end of all</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 4, 7.</NOTE> <HI>things is at hand:</HI> when

<P>All beings are of one of these 4. sorts. 1. Some are from euerlasting, not to euerlasting. 2. Some to euerlasting, not from euerlasting. 3. One only thing is both from, and to euerlasting. 4. The rest are nei|ther to, nor from euerlasting.</P>
<P N="1">1 Some are from euerlasting, not to euerlasting: as Gods eternal <HI>decrees;</HI> which haue an end in their determined time, but had no beginning. So God before all worlds <HI>determined</HI> the sending of his <HI>Son</HI> to dye for vs: but hee came <HI>in the fulnesse of time,</HI> saith the <HI>Apostle.</HI> This <HI>decree</HI> had no beginning; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 2, 23.

<P N="2"><PB N="49" REF="90">
2. Some are to euerlasting, not from euerlasting: as <HI>Angels,</HI> and mens <HI>Soules;</HI> which had a beginning in time, but shall neuer end; because they are crea|ted of an immortall nature.</P>
<P N="3">3. One onely thing, which is indeed <HI>Ens Enti|um,</HI> God himselfe, is both from euerlasting and to euerlasting. For he is an vncreated, and eternal sub|sistence: <HI>Alpha,</HI> and <HI>Omega;</HI> that <HI>first, and last;</HI> that had neither beginning, nor shal haue ending.

<P N="4">4. Other things are neyther from euerlasting, nor to euerlasting: for they had a beginning, and shall haue an end. Of this sort are all <HI>worldly</HI> things. God will giue them their end as he is <HI>Omega,</HI> that gaue them their creation as he is <HI>Alpha.</HI> All these things do decay, and shall perish.
<Q><L>Mors etiam saxis, nominibusq&abque; venit.</L></Q>
Death shall extend the force euen vpon stones and names.</P>
<P>VVho can then deny this <HI>world</HI> to be brittle? we see how slowly the tired earth returnes vs the fruits, which wee trusted her bowels with. Her vsury growes weake, like a decayed debter, vnable to pay vs the interest, she was wont.
<Q><P>Ni vis humana quotannis Maxima quaeque manu legeret.</P></Q></P>
<P>The <HI>World</HI> is lame, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Georg. 1.</NOTE> and euery member, as it were out of ioynt. It caught a fall in the Cradle, as <HI>Mephibosheth</HI> by falling from his <HI>Nurse;</HI> and the older it waxeth, the more maimedly it halteth. Sinne entred presently

<P>Now, since the <HI>world</HI> is a <HI>Sea,</HI> and so <HI>brittle,</HI> a <HI>Sea of glasse,</HI> let vs seeke to passe ouer well, but espe|cially to land well.

<P>Oh the infinite things and actions, that the <HI>eie</HI> of God sees at once, in this <HI>Chrystal glasse</HI> of the <HI>world!</HI> Some caring to come out of debt, others to get in|to debt. Some deluing for gold in the bowelles of the earth, others in the bowels of the poore. Some buying and bargaining, others cheating in the mar|ket. Some praying in their Closets, others quaf|flug in Tauernes.

There run honour and pride <HI>aequis ceruicibus.</HI> There walkes fraud cheeke by iowle with a Trades-man. There stalkes <HI>pride,</HI> with the pace of a Souldiour, but habit of a Courtier; striuing to <HI>adde to her owne stature:</HI> fetherd on the crown, cork'd at the heeles, light all ouer: stretching her legges, and spreading her winges like the Ostrich, with ostentation of great flight: but <HI>nil penna, sed vsus;</HI> not an inche higher or bettet. There slugs <HI>Idlenesse:</HI> both hands are in the bosome, whiles one foote should bee in the stirrop. Hollow in his eare, preach to him: if he will not waken, prick him with goads; let the cor|rectiue Law discple him.

<P>There slides by the meager <HI>ghost</HI> of <HI>malice,</HI> her blood drunke vp, the marrow of her bones wasted, her whole body like a meere Anatomy. There flye a crew of <HI>Oaths,</HI> like a flight of dismall Rauens; cro|king the <HI>Plague to the House,</HI> where the <HI>Swearer</HI> is. Zach. 5. Nay, ruine to the whole Land.

There goes murther from <HI>Aceldama,</HI> the field of blood, to <HI>Golgotha</HI> the place of dead sculs, and from thence to <HI>Hinnon</HI> the valley of fire and torments. There see <HI>Atheisme</HI> proiecting to displant the Paradise of God, and turne it to a wildernes of Serpents. Heauen is held but a Poets fable: and the terrors of hell, like <HI>Hercules</HI> club in the Tragedy, of huge bulke, but ragges and straw are the stuffing. Creatures that haue a little time on earth, &amp; then vanish. <HI>Tu qui dicis, Transit Christianus, ipse transis sine Christianis.</HI> Thou that sayest, the <HI>Christians</HI> pe|rish,

In hell they are indeede, but not as <HI>Atheists.</HI> They no sooner put their heads within those gates, but <HI>Atheisme</HI> drops off: they beleeue and feele now, there is a God.</P>
<P>There you shall heare <HI>Hypocrites,</HI> a pipient broode, cackling their owne ripenesse, when they are scarce out of their shelles. Whose wordes and workes differ, as it is seene in some Tappe-houses: when the painted walles haue sober sentences on them, as <HI>Feare God, honour the King, watch and pray, be sober, &amp;c.</HI> and there is nothing but drunkennes and swearing in the house. There is <HI>Ignorance,</HI> like a strucken <HI>Sodomite,</HI> groping for the way: nay in|deede, neither discerning nor desiring it. He sees neither <HI>Numen,</HI> nor <HI>Lumen;</HI> neither <HI>Diem</HI> the day|light of the Gospell, nor <HI>Deum,</HI> the God of day and Gospell.</P>
<P>There goes slouenly <HI>Faction,</HI> like a <HI>mal content,</HI> that with incendiary scruples labours to deuide <HI>Iu|dah</HI> from <HI>Israel.</HI> It was a strange doome, that <HI>Va|lens</HI> the Emperour gaue against <HI>Procopius;</HI> causing him to bee ty'd to two great trees bowed forcibly togither, and so his body to be pulled asunder, that would haue pulled asunder the body of the Em|pire. The <HI>Humourists</HI> thrust themselues into this throng, or else I would haue spared them, and that for loues sake: but truth of loue must not preiudice
<PB N="55" REF="93">
loue of <HI>Trueth.</HI> If they had as Imperatiue toungs, and Potential hands as they haue Optatiue minds, they would keepe an Infinitiue stirre in the lacera|ted Church. God sees the malicious <HI>Iesuite</HI> cal|ling vp a Parliament of Deuils, to plot treasons. He heares their damnable consultations: and obserues them, whiles they apparrell bloud-red murther, and blacke conspiracie, in the white robes of Religion.

<P>Hee beholds as in a cleare mirrour of <HI>Chrystall</HI> all our impurities, impieties; our contempt of Ser|mons, neglect of Sacraments, dishallowing his Sa|boths. Well&punc; as God sees all things so clearely; so I would to God, wee would behold somewhat. Let vs open our eyes, &amp; view in this <HI>Chrystall glasse</HI> our owne workes.

The Landlords oppression, Vsurers extortion, Patrons Simonie, Commons couetousnesse: our vnmercifulnes to the poore, o|uer-mercifulnes to the rich; malice, ebriety, pride, prophanation. These, these are the works, that God sees among vs: &amp; shall we not see them our selues? shall we be vtter strangers to our owne doings? <HI>Be not deceiued. Neither fornicators, nor Idolaters, nor a|dulterers,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 6. 9.</NOTE> <HI>nor theeues, nor couetous, nor drunkards, nor reuilers, nor extortioners shall inherite the king|dome

<P>Lastly, this <HI>glassy sea</HI> is not onely as <HI>Chrystall</HI> for the transparent brightnesse; that the Almighties eye may see all things done in it.

Therefore it is said verse 3. there is a <HI>Raine-bow about the Throne;</HI> which is a signe of Gods couenant, a seale of his eternall mercy towards vs. This is <HI>round about the Seat;</HI> that God can looke no way, but he must needs see it.

<PB N="57" REF="94">
<HI>helpe in time of need.</HI> If there be the fire of <HI>Iudge|ment,</HI> there is also the raine of <HI>Mercy</HI> to quench it.</P>
<P>Neither is this a transitory <HI>Throne,</HI> subiect to changes and chances, as all earthly <HI>thrones</HI> are: but Heb. 1. <HI>Thy throne, oh God, is for euer and euer: a scep|ter</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 1, 8.</NOTE> <HI>of righteousnesse is the scepter of thy kingdome.</HI> Lu. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 1, 33.</NOTE> 1. <HI>He shall raigne ouer the house of Iacob for euer; and of his kingdome there shall be no end.</HI></P>
