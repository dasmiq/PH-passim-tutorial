<HEAD>TO HIS GRACE THE Duke of Ormond.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE World has not been displeas'd to see in <HI>Rinaldo</HI> a Character Resembling Your Grace's, a Character of a Heroe who neither Rants nor Whines, but is great with a solid and real Greatness, very Valiant without Extravagance, and very Human with|out Weakness, and deserting Pleasure for Glory. And that Character naturally claims your Protection, which resembling yours has pleas'd all sorts of People: For your Grace
<PB REF="4">
at the same time that you have been the Darling of the Fair, has been the Passion of the Brave, and the Esteem of the Wife. The University of <HI>Oxford</HI> is proud of such a Chancellour, and the Armies of the King of such a Lieutenant General. All who are engag'd in the Cause of Truth, whether they defend her by Force or Argument, are animated and excited by having your Grace at the Head of them. But at the same time that you have been the Darling of the Fair, and the Esteem of the Wise, the Largeness of your Soul, and the Height of your Cou|rage, the Love of your Country and the Love of Glory, have made you almost the Adoration of the Armies. Whenever you were Encamp'd, the old Officers beheld with Wonder in you a double Portion of the greatness of Soul of the Noble Duke of <HI>Or|mond,</HI> your Grandfather. And whenever you were engag'd in the Field, the old Ani|mated Soldiers Review'd with Ravishment the Heroick Courage of your Father, the Brave Earl of <HI>Ossory.</HI> I must confess, My
<PB REF="4">
Lord, the commendation of any Man's Ancestors, is for the most part a Superfi|cial and a Foreign Praise; But to shew the High Esteem that we have of yours, is to shew the Value that we have for your Grace. I admire indeed the old Noble Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and the Brave Earl of <HI>Ossory,</HI> but I admire them most in your Grace. For the Blood of your Illustrious Family, like the Flood of a noble River, becomes more great and more august the farther it descends from its Source.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Ossory</HI> did as much as Man could do at <HI>Mons,</HI> and Success attended his Actions. Your Grace deserv'd to be Victo|rious at <HI>Landen,</HI> but Fortune would not have it so. But 'tis easie, my Lord, to look great in Prosperity; To be great in Adversity that is the Work. Your Grace in yours appear'd so exalted to your Enemies, that they al|most condemn'd that Fortune which had de|clar'd for them, and blush'd in their Captive to behold their Superior. I am afraid that I have gone too far, while I have ende|vour'd
<PB REF="5">
to please; For to shew that I am sen|sible of your extraordinary Merit, cannot but be pleasing to all the World but your Grace. But to shew that I had rather have your Approbation than that of the World, I here restrain the Passion which I have to proceed, and subscribe my self,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>My LORD, </SALUTE> <SIGNED>Your Grace's most Obedient Ser|vant, and most Humble Admirer, <HI>JOHN DENNIS.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Prologue to this Play is a sort of Preface to it; yet because Prose seems to be more Adapted to Criticism than Verse, I desire the Reader's leave to say something more largely of things which were men|tioned there. I had only the Hint of <HI>Rinaldo</HI>'s Character from <HI>Tasso,</HI> but the Character is my own. And if any one objects that by differing from <HI>Tasso,</HI> I offend in this Cha|racter against the Resemblance of the Manners, to him I answer; That the Manners of <HI>Rinaldo</HI> in <HI>Tasso</HI> being un|equal, they are Consequently not well mark'd, and that by Consequence there can be no Character. I was therefore at Liberty to form a Character from <HI>Tasso</HI>'s Hint the most agreeable to my Subject that I could.</P>
<P>I design'd <HI>Rinaldo</HI> then neither a Languishing nor a Brutal <HI>Heroe</HI>; He is Fond of <HI>Armida</HI> to the last de|gree, and yet resolves to leave her; but ow's that Resolu|tion to the Strength of his Reason, and not the weakness of his Passion. And as he resolves to leave her out of a sense of his Duty and Honour, and not any Levity or Bar|barity
<PB REF="6">
of Nature; so upon their meeting in the fourth Act, he demurrs upon executing that Resolution, neither thro' Fear, nor any tender Infirmity, but something that happen'd which seem'd to Require it from his Goodness, and his Humanity.</P>
<P>For <HI>Armida,</HI> some Gentlemen who have read <HI>Tasso,</HI> may expect to see that wanton alluring delicious Creature who appears in the fourth Canto of the <HI>Gierusalemme,</HI> with all that's tempting in Art; but I desire those Gentlemen to consider that in that Canto she only appears in Masquerade, and Acts a part at the Request of her Vnckle.</P>
<P><HI>Fa manto del vero ala Menzogna,</HI> making use of Arti|fices that were contrary to her Nature, in order to the Se|ducing the Heroes of Godfrey's Army. The Poet gives her true Character in the <HI>38th</HI> Stanza of the <HI>16th</HI> Canto of that Poem.</P>
<Q><L>E cosi pari al fasto hebbe lo sdegno</L>
<L>Ch' amo d esser Amata, odi&ocirc; gli amanti.</L></Q>
<P>She is by Nature a Proud and a disdainful Beauty, Proud of her Triumphs, yet disdaining the Slaves which adorn'd them, and so much the more violent in the Love she bore to <HI>Rinaldo,</HI> because he was the only Person who had touch'd her Soul with tenderness. And therefore I was oblig'd to shew her, as the Nature of her Character and of my Subject requir'd. I say not this to Arraign <HI>Tasso,</HI> who is certainly one of the greatest of Modern Poets; but to defend my self: for I leave it to any Man of Sense to Iudge, whether affectation be becoming of a Poem which
<PB REF="6">
ought only to express Nature; or the little Arts of a Iilt, of the Gravity, and Severity, and Majesty of the Tragick Muse.</P>
<P>But now 'tis time to answer an Objection. There is, say some Gentlemen, a Softness that is Natural to Love, and only that Softness, say they, should be capable of Engaging <HI>Rinaldo</HI>'s Heart; for 'tis hard to conceive, say they, how such a Heroe should be passionately fond of a Woman, who appears always either in a furious disorder, or using of horrible Incantations.</P>
<P>To this I answer, that the Action of the Play begins, but between three and four Hours before the Death of <HI>Ar|mida</HI>; That before that, the Lovers had been three Months together in the Enchanted Island, where she had enter|tain'd him with all that is Soft and Engaging in Art and Nature; That the fury of her disorder began but an hour be|fore the Beginning of the Action of the Play, from a Hint which one of her Spirits had given her of the approaching Danger. All this will appear to the discerning Reader from the Play it self, who then may perhaps be in|clin'd to believe that I have had a little Discretion in my Conduct, and that I have taken up the Story in that very part of it which alone is proper for Tragedy.</P>
<P>The Action is very Great and Important; upon the last Event of it depends the Success of the most Happy, and most Glorious Croisade, in which ever the Christians engaged a|gainst the Infidels. <HI>Godfrey</HI>'s Army had Beleaguer'd <HI>Jeru|salem,</HI> which, according to the Fable, could not possibly be taken till <HI>Rinaldo</HI> was return'd, and had cut down the
<PB REF="7">
Enchanted <HI>Grove.</HI> As the Action is Great, the Characters are Illustrious, and the Scene is extraordinary. All the Objects that appear to the Agents are almost intirely new; ev'ry thing they see in Nature, being wonderful, and sur|prising; ev'ry thing that they see in Art, being Terrible, and Astonishing.</P>
<P>I resolv'd therefore to do my Endeavour to treat this Sub|ject with something at least of that Sublime at once and Pathetick Air, which reigns in the renown'd <HI>Sophocles.</HI> I resolv'd to use some Effort to make the Greatness of the Sentiments and of the Images answer to the Height of the Subject, and the Dignity of the Expression to the Great|ness of the Sentiments. I design'd in this Poem to make Terror the prevailing Passion, which is likewise the predominant Passion in that admirable <HI>Grecian.</HI></P>
<P>The Action is not only Regular in the Mechanism, (the Incidents falling without any restraint into the narrow com|pass of the Representation) but Decent too, I hope, in the Conduct of it; and (to the Reserve of the Machines to which the necessity of the Subject oblig'd me) reasonable.</P>
<P>I have endeavour'd to shew as much Address as I could in the management of it. The first Act but just opens the Design, and just shews <HI>Armida</HI> in such a Light as was likeliest to prepossess an Audience in her Favour, and make them Espouse her Interests. As soon as I had done that by the mouth of <HI>Urania,</HI> I thought fit to oblige her to kreak off the Narration, according to that Important precept of <HI>Horace.</HI></P>
<Q><PB REF="7">
<L>Ordinis haec virtus erit et Venus aut ego fallor,</L>
<L>Ut Jam nunc dicat, Jam nunc debentia dici,</L>
<L>Pleraque differat, &amp; praesens in Tempus omittat.</L></Q>
<P><HI>Armida</HI> resumes and continues the Narration in the second Act, and by displaying the grounds of her Iealousie, shews the fundamental qualities of <HI>Rinaldo</HI>'s Character, and her own; the greatness of her Mind, the Pride of her Soul, the Violence of her Temper, and the Height of her Passion; and prepares what she says and does in the fourth Act, as <HI>Phenissa</HI> by endeavouring in this second Act to bring <HI>Armida</HI> off from her Passion, lays the Foundation of, and prepares the <HI>Catastrophe.</HI></P>
<P>It may now perhaps be expected that I should say some|thing in the defence of the Catastrophe. But the Objection against that being almost Vniversal, I should be unpar|donably Presumptuous, if I should Imagine that I could be in the Right, against the Consent of so many Illustrious As|semblies as Composed the Audiences of this Tragedy. All that I shall say in my Defence is this, that perhaps I may one Day Retrench that which displeas'd them, and that I shall be a little more Cautious the next time I am to en|tertain them.</P>

<L>Vsing Incentives to the Amorous Game,</L>
<L>And with affected, Meretricious. Arts,</L>
<L>Secretly Sliding into Hero's Hearts.</L>

<L>The great <HI>Torquato's</HI> Heroine shall appear,</L>
<L>But Proud, Fierce, Stormy, terribly severe,</L>
<L>Such as the <HI>Italian</HI> has <HI>Armida</HI> shown,</L>
<L>When by the Worlds disorder, she'd revenge her own.</L>

<L>And only Burns, and only Bleeds for everlasting Fame.</L>
<L>In a Iust Play such Heroes nere have part,</L>

<L>TO some fine Sparks methinks in yonder Rows,</L>
<L>The Brave <HI>Rinaldo,</HI> a Barbarian shows:</L>
<L>His leaving for a Camp his Amorous Care,</L>
<L>Is a rude thing they'l ne're Forgive they swear:</L>
<L>They ne're could think so barb'rously they say,</L>
<L>No, that Young Hero's meer Reverse are they:</L>
<L>On his young Cheeks Love's Charming power abides,</L>
<L>While in his Manly Breast the God of War resides:</L>
<L>In their soft Hearts, Ten Thousand Loves have places;</L>
<L>But Wars stern God dwells on their dreadful Faces:</L>
<L>While the late War in all it's fury Rag'd,</L>
<L>They ne're with <HI>Gauls</HI> in <HI>Belgian</HI> Plains Engag'd:</L>
<L>Nor Towring Fame on <HI>Alpine</HI> Mountains sought,</L>
<L>But here with Frightful looks, while others Fought,</L>
<L>They guarded the weak places they had Bought.</L>
<L>But you, who to your Country and your Fame,</L>
<L>Great Souls, still sacrific'd your Amorous Flame:</L>
<L>Who in each Spring, the season of Desire,</L>
<L>Left the Bright Dames, that set your Souls on Fire;</L>
<L>To follow <HI>William,</HI> forcing <HI>France</HI> to yeild,</L>
<L>And hunting Glory thro' the Dusty Field:</L>
