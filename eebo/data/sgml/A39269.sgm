<OPENER><SALUTE>My most Noble Lord and Patron.</SALUTE>
<SALUTE><HI>May it please your</HI> EXCELLENCY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THe Duty which I owe, first unto <HI>GOD,</HI> as his <HI>Mi|nister,</HI> then to my <HI>SOVERAIGN,</HI> as his <HI>Subject,</HI> and in the next place to Your <HI>EXCEL|LENCY,</HI>
<PB REF="3">
as Your <HI>Domestick Chap|lain,</HI> made the <HI>threefold cord</HI> where|by <HI>I</HI> found my self indispensibly obliged, to contribute that little I was able, towards the Solemnity of that memorable and happyest <HI>Day,</HI> which this poor <HI>Kingdome</HI> hath in many yeares beheld. And having, after my <HI>weak</HI> manner, preach'd this <HI>plain</HI> and <HI>short Sermon,</HI> which had then <HI>Your</HI> Excellency's <HI>approbation,</HI> and (I hope) since <HI>GOD's pardon</HI> for my failings there|in; I had very well satisfied my self; as I shall alwayes have great reason to doe, when by <HI>serving GOD, I</HI> can <HI>please</HI> Your <HI>EXCEL|LENCY. I</HI> confesse, <HI>I</HI> then understood no <HI>obligation</HI> that lay
<PB REF="3">
upon me to doe, what now <HI>I</HI> am <HI>commanded</HI> to doe, to preach it o|ver again this <HI>Second</HI> time to the VVorld; beeing <HI>(I</HI> blesse <HI>GOD</HI> for it) yet uninfected with that <HI>ambitious</HI> itch of making my self known abroad, and loving to be <HI>gazed</HI> upon, as some-body by the <HI>Multitude.</HI> 'Tis very fitt that <HI>they,</HI> and <HI>onely</HI> they, should wear great <HI>names,</HI> who have great <HI>meritts</HI> to support them; and that <HI>they</HI> alone should be permitted to praesent their labours to the <HI>publike</HI> eye, whose great <HI>abilities,</HI> by being so made <HI>manifest,</HI> may become more instrumentall to the <HI>publike</HI> Good: But (My <HI>LORD)</HI> Your <HI>HO|NOUR</HI> seem'd very well to <HI>un|derstand</HI>
<PB REF="4">
the' extent of that <HI>Talent</HI> wherewith GOD hath intrusted mee, when You presented mee to the charge of my <HI>little Flock</HI> in the Country; but too much to <HI>value</HI> it, when You committed to mee that <HI>other</HI> of Your <HI>Family:</HI> being thus <HI>en|tertain'd</HI> and <HI>employ'd, I</HI> need not seek abroad for more <HI>worke</HI> or more <HI>honour:</HI> and therefore (My <HI>LORD)</HI> that <HI>I</HI> now expose this <HI>rude</HI> piece, &amp; my <HI>selfe</HI> with it, to the <HI>forward cen|sures</HI> of all that see it, it is a piece of <HI>meer Obedience</HI> to Your <HI>EXCEL|LENCYS</HI> expresse, and indeed, <HI>importunate</HI> Commands: <HI>I</HI> alwayes resolving, soe farre as they are <HI>Iust</HI> (and <HI>I</HI> know they will ever be most exactly so) rather to <HI>suffer</HI> by them, then to <HI>disobey</HI> them.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">
<HI>I</HI> have often heard Your <HI>EX|CELLENCY,</HI> and My Lord, (would it signifie any thing to say what <HI>pleased mee) I</HI> would say, with much <HI>pleasure I</HI> have hearken'd to You, discoursing of that satisfa|ction You reap'd, from that sweet <HI>privacy</HI> and <HI>retirement</HI> his <HI>MA|IESTY</HI> is pleased to grant Your <HI>LORD-SHIP</HI> here in the <HI>Coun|try,</HI> where You live free from the <HI>Noise</HI> and <HI>Cumbrance</HI> of <HI>Court</HI> and <HI>Citty.</HI> Indeed, the greatest <HI>reward</HI> his <HI>MAIESTY</HI> can possibly re|compense Your <HI>matchlesse</HI> services withall, is thus to bestow <HI>YOUR-SELF</HI> upon <HI>YOUR-SELF;</HI> and <HI>I</HI> know You think it greater hap|pinesse to enjoy <HI>My LORD
<PB REF="5">
MARQVIS</HI> of <HI>NEW CASTLE</HI> at <HI>WELBECK,</HI> then all the <HI>Offi|ces</HI> and <HI>Honours</HI> which your <HI>exem|plary Loyalty</HI> has meritted: And there's all the reason in the VVorld for it, that <HI>Hee</HI> who hath so <HI>Nobly</HI> sacrificed the <HI>Fairest</HI> of his <HI>Yeares,</HI> and the <HI>Amplest</HI> of his <HI>Revenues,</HI> to the service of his <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Country,</HI> should now have leave to Conse|crate the <HI>remainder</HI> to his <HI>Health</HI> and <HI>Quiet.</HI> My LORD, could I ever hope to <HI>merit</HI> of Your EX|CELLENCY, <HI>I</HI> would not yet leave begging a <HI>Favour</HI> of the <HI>same</HI> kind; that, as <HI>I</HI> have an <HI>Ho|nourable</HI> place in Your <HI>Family,</HI> so <HI>I</HI> might live <HI>retiredly</HI> from all the world besides. But seeing. (My
<PB REF="5">
LORD) Your commands lye so <HI>heavy</HI> upon me, I will endeavour to bear them with the best strength <HI>I</HI> have, and still incourage my selfe with this confidence, that it is all one with Your <HI>EXCELLENCY</HI> to <HI>Command</HI> and <HI>Patronize:</HI> And therefore after others have served in their solemne joyes, with all be|coming <HI>State</HI> and <HI>Magnificence, I</HI> hope <HI>I</HI> may (atleast) obtaine a <HI>par|don,</HI> If <HI>I</HI> make bold to drop in, in the <HI>Rear,</HI> and offer too my <HI>poor dish of cold water in the name of a Disciple.</HI> Many, 'tis true, goe <HI>before</HI> mee, and it is very <HI>fit</HI> they should; Others come with <HI>richer cloathing,</HI> and <HI>finer language,</HI> and why not? <HI>They that weare soft rayment,</HI> and <HI>they that speak
<PB REF="6">
soft words too, are in Kings houses.</HI> It is the great <HI>freedome</HI> Your <HI>EXCEL|LENCY</HI> is pleas'd to indulge me, to speak mine <HI>owne sense</HI> in mine <HI>own words,</HI> fully and freely; and <HI>I</HI> am so much the servant of my <HI>greatest Master,</HI> that <HI>I</HI> greedily embrace all the <HI>Liberty</HI> can be granted mee in this kind. If there be any thing in this short Discourse, disrelishing to the palates of those that read it; it will be enough for mee to tel them, it is a <HI>Sermon,</HI> and therefore not <HI>pur|posely</HI> suited to any man's <HI>humour:</HI> and yet, <HI>I</HI> will adde; it hath passed Your <HI>EXCELLENCY'S ap|probation,</HI> and that will be enough to answer whatever may be obje|cted against it. Let men say what
<PB REF="6">
they will, <HI>I</HI> have abundantly satis|fied my selfe, by praying that <HI>all,</HI> even they that <HI>dispise</HI> it (if it be pos|sible) may be <HI>better'd</HI> by it; and in taking this opportunity of expres|sing my selfe, by this, as by all <HI>ho|nest</HI> meanes, <HI>I</HI> shall alwayes labour to doe, My LORD,</P>

<Q><P><HI>v:</HI> 22. The stone which the builders refused, is become the Head-stone of the Corner.</P>
<P>23. This is the LORD's doing, and it is marveilous in our Eyes.</P>
<P>24. This is the day which the LORD hath made, we will re|joyce and be glad in it.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_SHould the great GOD forbear to expresse his Goodnes to|wards the sinfull sons of men, 'till man begin to un|derstand what is best for himself; we should soon become all as <HI>mi|serable,</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="8">
as at present we are <HI>ignorant;</HI> we should die in our sins, and drop into Hell, ere we would understand the happynes of an Heaven, or the lovelinesse of that way which leads unto it. And yet doth our grossest <HI>Ignorance</HI> fall much short of our <HI>per|versenes;</HI> what now aggravates our <HI>guilt,</HI> and (without a timely repentance) will adde to our <HI>torments</HI> hereafter, is this, that we so often <HI>know</HI> what we ought to <HI>doe,</HI> when we yet stubbornly refuse to <HI>doe</HI> what we <HI>know</HI> to be our duty. So that if our good GOD did delight only there to shew <HI>Mercy,</HI> where he meets with <HI>meritt,</HI> did he not, on the contrary, love to <HI>magnifie</HI> his <HI>Goodnes,</HI> by pittying even those, whose dayly busines it has been to <HI>provoke</HI> his <HI>Iustice:</HI> Blessings would soone be as rare, as Sins are rife; and Heaven would at last be as empty of <HI>men,</HI> as Hell is of <HI>Saints.</HI></P>
<P>But (Blessed be our Good GOD!) <HI>his mercy endureth for ever.</HI> The unnaturall sin|ner ever <HI>Kicks</HI> and <HI>spurns</HI> at the yerning bowells of a tenderly compassionate Father;
<PB N="3" REF="8">
and they onely <HI>swell</HI> the more, and <HI>extend</HI> the wider towards the miserable wretch; even so wide, till they reach a <HI>Miracle;</HI> such a miracle as forceth Stupidity it self into wonder and <HI>Admiration;</HI> yea such a won|der as cannot contain it self, but suddenly breaks forth into a signall <HI>joy,</HI> and a solemne <HI>thanks-giving.</HI> This, and more then all this, we read in the Text.</P>
<P N="1">1. A blessing proffer'd, no sooner proffer'd but rejected, and though rejected, yet sent againe, and that with advantage. <HI>The stone which the builders refused is become the Head stone of the Corner.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. This great mercy thus rejected, and thus returning, is (as it ought to bee) hum|bly acknowledged, highly admired. <HI>This is the</HI> LORD's <HI>doing, and it is marvailous in our Eyes.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. This great wonder and Humility are seasonably seconded with an Hearty Joy, and Solemne Thangs-giving. <HI>This is the day which the</HI> LORD <HI>hath made, we will rejoyce and be glad in it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="9">
Thus, the <HI>Text</HI> wants nothing that's fit: for the <HI>day,</HI> presenting us with a <HI>Wonderfull Blessing,</HI> an <HI>Humble Reception,</HI> and a <HI>Ioy|full Thanks-giving:</HI> In all which we shall. briefly consider, first, the History and the Doctrine; next, the Parallel and the Use.</P>
<P N="1">1. We begin with the great <HI>Blessing:</HI> con|cerning which, let us enquire, 1. What it was? 2. To whom it was proffer'd? 3. What welcome it found?</P>
<P N="1">1. This <HI>Blessing</HI> in the Metaphor, is a <HI>Stone;</HI> in the History, <HI>David</HI> in the Prophecy, <HI>Christ:</HI> and whether <HI>David;</HI> the Type of <HI>Christ,</HI> or <HI>Christ</HI> the Seed of <HI>David;</HI> still wee shall find it a Precious <HI>Stone,</HI> and a great <HI>Blessing.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Stone</HI> in the History is <HI>David,</HI> thatho|ly King, in whose Royall <HI>Person</HI> most of the Happinesse of the <HI>Old,</HI> &amp; in whose Heaven|ly <HI>Seed</HI> all the Happinesse of the <HI>New Israel of GOD</HI> did consist. <HI>David</HI> the <HI>Author</HI> and the <HI>Subject</HI> of this Gratulatory hymne, an Hymne composed and set for the Solemne Quire of Israel to be sung by them in their
<PB N="5" REF="9">
joyfull commemoration of the happy return of <HI>God's Anointed,</HI> and their long exiled <HI>King:</HI> He is the <HI>stone.</HI> A <HI>stone</HI> hewen out of the rock, by <HI>God's</HI> own hand; consecrated with the Holy Oyle by <HI>God's</HI> own Prophet; set apart by <HI>God's</HI> appointment, to smite down the great <HI>Goliah</HI> of the Philistines, to dash in pieces the Tyranny of a wicked <HI>Saul,</HI> to crush to nothing the Enemies of <HI>God</HI> and of his chosen <HI>Israel.</HI> A <HI>stone</HI> fitted and squa|red to be the foundation, and pillar of his <HI>Hierusalem,</HI> his <HI>Sion;</HI> solid and <HI>firme,</HI> such as the hottest fires of Persecution could not crack; nor all the stormes and tempests of Af|fliction impaire; of that weight, and so well fixable, that all the strength and art of Sa|than and his Instruments could not remove or shake it; but still he stood fast, the Foun|dation, the Pillar, the sure stay and support of <HI>God's</HI> Church and People committed to his Charge. Hee is the <HI>stone</HI> in the History: which in the Prophecy is.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Christ IESVS</HI> our <HI>Lord,</HI> the everlasting <HI>seed</HI> of <HI>David.</HI> The sure <HI>rock</HI> of our <HI>Salva|tion.</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="10">
So <HI>He</HI> himself applies the text to him|selfe. <HI>Math:</HI> 21.) and after him, his Apo|stle <HI>S^t Peter</HI> (1 Pet: 2.) <HI>He,</HI> who was a <HI>stone of stumbling,</HI> and <HI>a Rock of Offence,</HI> to the <HI>Iew</HI> first, and then to the <HI>Gentile;</HI> is a most sure hold, and a strong Tower of defence to all those that stedfastly believe in him; the firme and everlasting Foundation of the <HI>New Hierusalem:</HI> the chief <HI>corner-stone, In whom all the building fitly framed together, groweth unto an Holy Temple in the Lord. Ephes: 2. 20. &amp;</HI> 21. This is the living <HI>stone,</HI> of which that former was no more but the bare shadow: the <HI>stone</HI> whereon our Hopes, our Comforts, our present pri|viledges, and our future Inheritance, all are surely founded: the Rock on which, if we be once well bottomed, let the <HI>winds blow,</HI> and <HI>the waves beat,</HI> and all these with all the violence they can, yet shall we stand sure and unshaken to all eternity. These be the <HI>stones</HI> here proffer'd in the Text, <HI>David</HI> first and afterwards <HI>Christ;</HI> and (what I would desire you to note) both these <HI>Kings</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="10">
A good <HI>King</HI> is indeed a most precious <HI>stone,</HI> the most solid foundation of the Church's peace and the Peopl's happynes: remove this <HI>stone,</HI> and the whole house comes down upon your head; touch but the <HI>Lord's anoin|ted,</HI> and you disjoint all, the whole King|dome shatters into confusion; all falls into pieces, and all the wit of man is not able to bind it up again: Proofs and instances of this sad truth we have too many, our own lamentable experience, still fresh in our me|mories, renders all citations of them at pre|sent needlesse: Hereby we have found, that whosoever wildly pushes at these sacred <HI>stones,</HI> he onely runs his head against an hard Rock, which though he should have the unhappy strength to shake a little, yet he shall be sure withall to dash out his own brains, at lest he must expect to receive such a wound, as cannot easily be healed but he is like to bleed into a too late repentance: He that fights against the <HI>powers</HI> set up by God, can onely beat the skin off his own fingers. It will be therefore our <HI>Prudence</HI> as
<PB N="8" REF="11">
well as our <HI>duty,</HI> not to strike with too much violence upon these holy <HI>stones,</HI> left like men hammering too boldly on a good flint, wee thence produce such a fire as will not again be quenched: <HI>Saint Paul</HI> dares not warrant so strange a Confidence, when he tels us, <HI>(Rom. 13.) They that resist the power shall re|ceive to themselves Damnation.</HI> Rather pray we, that we may never come to want such a <HI>Stone</HI> as God here profer'd in the Text. but,</P>
<P N="2">2. To <HI>whom</HI> did he proffer it?</P>
<P>Even to <HI>those,</HI> who wanted not eyes to see it, nor experience to understand the worth and value of it, nor skill sufficient to make a right use of it. <HI>David</HI> was profer'd, not to the poor <HI>rude Israelites,</HI> that could not distinguish their right hand from their left, but to the <HI>Grandees</HI> of <HI>Israel,</HI> to <HI>Saul</HI> and his <HI>Councellours;</HI> whose businesse and Profes|sion it was to deal in such <HI>Stones.</HI> Our Bles|sed <HI>IESVS</HI> was profer'd, not onely to a few blind Gentiles, who had all their knowledg but at the second hand; the wonder had
<PB N="9" REF="11">
not been great if these had refused what they so little understood; but he was proffer'd to the <HI>VVise men</HI> and <HI>Rulers</HI> of the <HI>Iews,</HI> to the great <HI>Maister-builders</HI> of that Church, <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Pharisees, Lawyers</HI> and <HI>Doctors;</HI> those that knew the <HI>Law,</HI> and had read the <HI>Prophets,</HI> and understood what was fore|told, and prefigured concerning him: whose bare <HI>acceptance</HI> of him, had been precedent and warrant enough for the Peo|ples <HI>Faith;</HI> as appears by that question <HI>(Iohn 7, 48.) have any of the Rulers or of the Phari|sees believed on him?</HI> So would they doubt|lesly have said, Have any of the <HI>Rulers</HI> or <HI>Pharisees received</HI> this <HI>stone?</HI> If they have, then so will <HI>we.</HI></P>
<P>This is God's method, he so proffers his great <HI>Blessings</HI> as to leave the refuser without excuse; to those who best could discerne the worth of it, and therefore should first in all reason have begun to use it, was this Gift proffer'd: lest afterwards they should goe about to excuse themselves with a <HI>Non novi|mus, we knew is not:</HI> The fittest <HI>Blessing</HI> to
<PB N="10" REF="12">
the fittest <HI>persons,</HI> the <HI>stone</HI> to the <HI>builders.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Lett's now see, what's it's <HI>welcome.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed very <HI>course</HI> and more <HI>strange,</HI> con|sidering the persons to whom it was prof|fer'd: so <HI>foolish</HI> were they, or so <HI>selfish,</HI> or <HI>both;</HI> they <HI>refused</HI> it.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>David</HI> is thrust out from the presence of <HI>Saul,</HI> bannish'd the Land, driven into Caves and Dens, to lead a sad &amp; melanchol|ly life with Bears and Tygres; or at best, a|mongst strangers, too frequently more in|humane and barbarous, then those beasts of prey. He is hunted like a silly partridge upon the Mountains, and no means that a cruell and jealous <HI>Saul</HI> could invent, left un|attempted, to rid him of his Kingdome and the world at once.</P>
<P N="2">2. And in this particular too, was our Blessed JESVS, very truly the <HI>Son of Da|vid.</HI> He is <HI>refused</HI> of his own People and Nation: rejected by the chief <HI>Rulers,</HI> and <HI>High-priests,</HI> with a&mdash;No King but <HI>Caesar:&mdash;</HI>Not this man, but <HI>Barabbas.</HI> Any murthe|rer, rather then the Lord of life; a bloody
<PB N="11" REF="12">
Tyrant, rather then the God of mercies; a|way to the <HI>Crosse</HI> with him. This is the ve|ry voyce of the builders, No stone of God's squaring for our building, out with it a|mongst the rubbish: Give us rather a <HI>Nero,</HI> any lump of clay kneeded up in Christian blood: Give us such stones as will admit of no Cement, but what's made of the <HI>blood of us and of our Children:</HI> that blood which <HI>Caesar</HI> sheds, be it on the heads of us and ours, but this stone which God would in mercy bestow upon us, be it thrown out in|to the streets, and trampled under our feet forever. This is the language of these prudent <HI>builders.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, even thus doe the <HI>builders</HI> too of|ten prove the unhappy <HI>demolishers,</HI> and when they should strengthen, rase to the ground the walls of <HI>Hierusalem:</HI> whilest they lay their own <HI>ambition,</HI> their <HI>Humors,</HI> and their <HI>Interests,</HI> the onely Foundations of all their actions; they are sure to <HI>refuse</HI> that <HI>stone,</HI> which is sent down from Heaven. Here's the Wisedome of the Wise, this is the Coun|saile
<PB N="12" REF="13">
of the Prudent, when they have not God before their Eyes. The <HI>stone is refused,</HI> which yet in spite of all their little Policies, and petty devices, shall most certainly return the <HI>Head-stone of the building.</HI> Which brings us from the Folly and Basenesse of the <HI>buil|ders,</HI> to the unerring Wisedome, and Con|stant Goodnesse, of <HI>God Almighty.</HI></P>
<P><HI>They</HI> cast out the <HI>stone, God</HI> brings it in a|gain, <HI>They</HI> reject it with <HI>scorn, He</HI> sets it in with <HI>advantage, They refuse</HI> it as uselesse, and unfit for any thing, <HI>He restores</HI> it the Beuty, the strength of the whole Fabrick.</P>
<P><HI>David,</HI> after his long and tedious exile, is call'd home again, even by those same per|sons who at first were as ready as any to re|ject him; with the shouts and acclamations of <HI>Israal</HI> he is welcomed, and made the Glory of that people, and their bulwark, by whom he had been so much sleighted.</P>
<P>And thus was it with the great <HI>Rock of our Salvation,</HI> after his numerous and grie|vous sufferings, hardly ending in a bitter and a shamefull death; He rose again, and as|cended
<PB N="13" REF="13">
into Heaven in Glory and Triumph, and is become the <HI>Head</HI> of the <HI>Universall Church,</HI> and the onely Sanctuary those very Enemies who refused him can confide in.</P>
<P><HI>God</HI> will have his designe, let man do his worst; he will make all those in his due time to understand their own folly, who would not when they ought, embrace his Counsaile. The <HI>stones</HI> which He sends are more precious in his eyes then to lye always unreguarded on a Dung|hill: <HI>David's</HI> Palace and Kingdome shall not forever be a Cave and a wildernesse; <HI>Christ</HI>'s Crown shall not alwaies be made of Thornes; Those Cruell hammerings, and rougher usages, which the despised <HI>stone</HI> at present undergoes, shall not break and Crush it, but, on the Con|trary, Square and smooth, and polish it, and make it the more serviceable, and fitter for the building; His Enemies at length shall know, that those many torments they barbarously in|flicted on him, shall reflect with doubled force upon themselves; and by a seasonable and un|expected restauration they shall be made to ac|knowledge, that the undeserved exile of their
<PB N="14" REF="14">
<HI>David,</HI> was not the punishment of his Sins, but the greatest curse could be lay'd upon his very Persecutors.</P>
<P>And here, on the one hand, we may clearly be|hold, the folly and blindnesse of worldly men, even of those who would fain be esteem'd the wisest and skilfull'st <HI>builders</HI> &amp; repairers of a broaken state; on the other hand, the Infinite Wisedome and Providence of <HI>God,</HI> even in those actions which seem lest considerable to the dim eyes of men. Here we see man's Unworthy|nesse and perversnesse in slighting and <HI>refusing</HI> the very choisest of God's blessings, <HI>there</HI> God's Infinite mercy and unalterable Goodnesse in <HI>re|doubling</HI> his blessings after they have been <HI>refused:</HI> In short, <HI>here's</HI> man's impiety in rejecting the <HI>stone</HI> which <HI>God</HI> had design'd, and by <HI>proffering</HI> it, Commended: <HI>there's God's</HI> Justice in mak|ing that despised <HI>stone</HI> to become at last, all that he intended it for at first, even the <HI>Head-stone of the Corner.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Thus are we, from the <HI>wonderfull mercy,</HI> come to the <HI>cheerfull reception</HI> thereof. It is received (as so great a blessing ought to be) with an <HI>humble
<PB N="15" REF="14">

<P>Let us therefore be Glad and Rejoyce: be <HI>Glad</HI> inwardly, and <HI>Rejoyce</HI> outwardly, be so <HI>glad,</HI> that <HI>God</HI> may accept of our Joy, as an accep|table sacrifice of praise and thansgiving for his great and provident mercy, in having reguard unto his holy One: and so <HI>rejoyce</HI> that the world may see we are glad indeed, &amp; acknowledg him the Author of our Happinesse. It is most fit, that as the world hath seen us sad, yea, perhaps too sinfully dejected in the <HI>Day</HI> of our Afflictions; so it should now behold us cheerfull and full of joy, but still without sinfulnesse, in this <HI>Day which the LORD hath made.</HI></P>
<P>Onely let us here beware, lest we so rejoyce as to forfeit againe the ground of our joyes: In vain do we observe this <HI>Day</HI> as a <HI>Thanksgiving|day,</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="26">
except we labour to keep every <HI>Day</HI> of our life henceforward <HI>Holy-day.</HI> It is not enough to say LORD we thanke thee, but we are to Sa|crifice our Persons and our endeavours to his honour and glory; returning him not onely the Calves of our lips, but the Affections of our hearts, and the labours of our hands, and the o|bedience of the whole man for the abundance of his mercies. Our <HI>King,</HI> our <HI>Church,</HI> our <HI>Land</HI> have all too long groaned under our <HI>Sinfull</HI> re|joy cings, and let us take heed lest all these suffer over again by our confident and presumptuous re-assuming of such carnall Joyes: Why should it be any longer said, and that with so much co|lour of truth, that <HI>Loyalty</HI> and <HI>Piety</HI> cannot dwel together in the same brest? Why should it be any longer said to our shame, that <HI>swearing,</HI> &amp; <HI>drink|ing,</HI> and <HI>deriding Religion,</HI> and <HI>making a mock of Holinesse,</HI> are the Principall badges of such as call themselves <HI>Royallists?</HI> We know <HI>who</HI> and <HI>what</HI> they are who have long agoe publikely boasted, that they have been the <HI>King's</HI> best Subjects and Friends, the way to confute them is not to <HI>swear</HI> they are not so, but to prove by our <HI>actions</HI> that
<PB N="39" REF="26">
we indeed are so: and to do this, there's no way left us but to be as <HI>sincerely</HI> Religious, as they <HI>hypocrytically:</HI> We may safely give leave to the <HI>Covenanter,</HI> the <HI>Engager,</HI> and the rest of a <HI>Schisma|ticall</HI> people to pretend as high as they can, whil'st we are sure we are as much as they can pretend to Let us but once <HI>out-doe</HI> and <HI>out live</HI> them, 'tis no great matter who <HI>out-talks,</HI> and <HI>out|braves</HI> us: but let us by no meanes <HI>give occasion to the enemies of God to Blaspheme;</HI> but whilst we endeavour to expresse our <HI>Loyalty</HI> in our <HI>Ioy,</HI> let our <HI>joy</HI> be most clearly manifested in our <HI>Obedi|ence</HI> to <HI>His</HI> just commands, and in our <HI>Confor|mity</HI> to his <HI>good</HI> example; whose <HI>first Proclamation</HI> was to <HI>condemne</HI> and <HI>prohibit,</HI> and whose whole course of <HI>life</HI> is to <HI>shame</HI> all manner of <HI>Profane|nesse</HI> and <HI>debauchery.</HI> Let but our good and righ|teous actions first stop the <HI>mouthes</HI> of our Ene|mies, and then our Righteous <HI>God</HI> will undoubt|edly bind their <HI>hands,</HI> and turne their <HI>hearts,</HI> and make us all at last charitably and unanimous|ly to joyne in the Praises of that great <HI>God,</HI> who hath miraculously restored our <HI>Corner-stone,</HI> and rebuilt our <HI>Hierusalem,</HI> and made her once more
<PB N="40" REF="27">
<HI>a Citty</HI> in a fair way to be <HI>at unity within herself. He</HI> will then make our <HI>King</HI> a glorious <HI>Prince,</HI> and us happy <HI>Subjects,</HI> and all of us at last more happy <HI>Saints,</HI> when we shall all obtain <HI>Crownes</HI> and <HI>Kingdomes,</HI> and be <HI>built</HI> up together one tri|umphant Church on our <HI>Head Corner-stone Christ IESVS;</HI> full of all <HI>Gladnesse,</HI> and <HI>Rejoycing,</HI> and perpetuall singings, to the Honour and Glory of him that sitteth upon the everlasting Throne, who is LORD of <HI>Lords,</HI> and KING of <HI>Kings;</HI> to whom for his unspeakable mercy to our Gra|cious <HI>King,</HI> and to us his Subjects in his happy Restauration, let us ascribe all <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Glory, Praise</HI> and <HI>Thanksgiving</HI> now and for ever.</P>
