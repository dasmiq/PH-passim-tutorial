<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HO|NOVRABLE, AND TRV|ly Noble Lord, WILLIAM, Earle of PEMBROKE.</HEAD>
<P>_BY your Honours fa|uour, I had a place in the sad Court of <HI>Whitehall</HI> this last Lent: and it was so disposed by our blessed Maker, that I know not whether, my Text was a Comment vpon the Occasion, or the Occasion vpon my Text: they met together with such vnhappy happi|nesse. As this Sermon tooke Birth in the highest Sphere of our King|dome, so there learning to presume on the helpe of your Noble wing, it

hath aduentured to flie abroad. And whither, iustly, should it take the first flight, but to your Honours Protection, from whom it receiued Breath and Motion? I haue beene bold also to send a paire of Seruants to wayt vpon it, which were produ|ced by other solemne occasions. I humbly beseech your Lordsh. to giue them all your Passe: and then I feare not, but that for your Noble Names sake, (not their owne me|rite) wheresoeuer they light, they shall find kind entertainment; and doe yet some more good to the Church of God. Which successe, together with your Honours happinesse, is still prayed for, by</P>

<P>_THis is in many deare re|gards a mourning and pe|nitentiall season, therefore I thought best to accom|modate it with a peniten|tiall Sermon. <HI>I abhorre my selfe, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Affliction is a winged Chariot, that mounts vp the soule toward hea|uen: nor doe wee euer so rightly vnderstand Gods Maiestie, as when wee are not able to stand vnder our owne miserie. It was <HI>Naamans</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="4">
leprosie that brought him to the knowledge of the <HI>Prophet,</HI> and the <HI>Prophet</HI> brought him to the sauing knowledge of the true God: had he not beene a leper, hee had still beene a sinner. <HI>Schola crucis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Zepper.</HI></NOTE> <HI>schola lucis:</HI> there is no such Schoole instructing, as the crosse afflicting. If <HI>Paul</HI> had not beene <HI>buffeted by Satan,</HI> hee might haue gone nigh to buffet God, through danger of being puffed vp with his reuelations.</P>
<P>The Lord hath many messengers, by whom he solicites man: He sends one health, to make him a strongman: another wealth, to make him a rich man: another sicknesse, to make him a weake man: another loss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, to make him a poore man: another age, to make him an old man: another death, to make him no man. But among them all, none dispatcheth the busines surer or sooner then affliction: if that faile of bringing a man home, nothing can doe it. He is stil impor|tunate for an answere; yea, hee speakes, and strikes. Doe wee complaine of his incessant blowes? alas, hee doth but his office, he waites for our Repentance; let vs giue the messenger his errand, and hee will be gone. Let him take the proud man in hand, he will humble him: he can make the Drunkard sober; the Lascinious chast: the Angry patient; the Couetous cha|ritable; fetch the Vnthrift Sonne backe againe to his Father,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 15.17.</NOTE> whom a full purse had put into an itch of trauelling: the only breaker of those wild Colts. <HI>Ier.</HI> 5. the waters of that Deluge, which (though they put men in feare of their
<PB N="3" REF="4">
liues) beare them vp in the Arke of Repentance higher toward heauen. It brought the brethren to the acquaintance of <HI>Ioseph,</HI> and makes ma|ny a poore sinner familiar with the Lord <HI>Iesus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Iob</HI> was not ignorant of God before, while he sate in the Sun-shine of peace; but resting his head on the bosome of plenty, hee could lye at his ease, and contemplate the goodnesse of his Maker. But as when the Sunne shines forth in his most glorious brightnesse, we are then least able to looke vpon him: wee may solace our selues in his diffused rayes and comfortable light, but wee cannot fixe our eyes vpon that burning Carbuncle. These outward things do so engrosse vs, take vp our consideration, and drowne our contemplatiue facultie in our sense; that so long, wee onely obserue the effects of Gods goodnesse, rather then the goodnesse of God it selfe. Necessitie teacheth vs the worth of a friend; as <HI>Absynthium,</HI> wormewood rub|bed vpon the eyes, makes them smart a little, but they see the clearer. Therefore <HI>Iob</HI> confes|ed, that in his prosperity hee had onely (as it were) heard of God; but now in his tryall hee had seene him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vers. 5.</NOTE> <HI>I heard of thee by the hearing of the eare, but now mine eye seeth thee</HI>: that is, he had obtained a more cleare and perspicuous vision of him; the eye being more apprehensiue of the obiect then the eare. <HI>Segnii&ugrave;s irritant animos di|missa per aures.</HI> When wee heare a man descri|bed, our Imagination conceiues an Idea or forme of him but darkely: if wee see him, and in
<PB N="4" REF="5">
tentiuely looke vpon him, there is an impression of him in our minds: wee know his stature, his gesture, his complection, his proportion. <HI>Sic o|culos, sic ille manus, sic or a ferebat.</HI> Such a more full and perfect apprehension of God did cala|mity work in this holy man; and from that spe|culation proceedes this humiliation; <HI>Wherefore I abhorre my selfe, and repent in dust and ashes.</HI></P>
<P>Where wee may consider three degrees of mortification; the Sicknesse, the Death, and the Buriall of Sinne. <HI>I abhorre my selfe,</HI> there sinne is sicke and wounded: <HI>I repent,</HI> there it is wounded and dead: <HI>In dust and ashes,</HI> there it is dead and buried. To <HI>denie</HI> ones selfe, maimes concupi|scence, that it cannot thriue: to <HI>repent,</HI> kills it, that it cannot liue: <HI>in dust and ashes,</HI> buries it, that it cannot rise vp againe. I throw it into the Graue, I couer it with mould, I rake it vp <HI>in dust and ashes.</HI></P>
<P>But I will not pull the Text in peeces; on|ly I follow the manuduction of the words: for there is not a superfluous word in the verse, as the Psalmist said of the Army of <HI>Israel, There was not one feeble person among them.</HI> It beginnes as high as the glory of Heauen, and ends as low as the basest of Earth. The first word [<HI>Therefore</HI>] respects an infinite God: the last words [<HI>Dust and ashes</HI>] declare an humbled man. The meditation of the former is the cause of the latter, and the condition of the latter is the way to the former. To study God, is the way to make an humble man: and an humble
<PB N="5" REF="5">
man is in the way to come vnto God. Such a consideration will cast vs down to <HI>dust and ashes:</HI> such a prostration will lift vs vp to glory and blessednesse. Here then is a <HI>Iacobs Ladder,</HI> but of foure rounds. Diuinitie is the Highest, <HI>I haue se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, Therefore.</HI> Mortalitie is the lowest, <HI>Dust and ashes.</HI> Betweene both these, sit two o|thers, <HI>Shame</HI> and <HI>Sorrow</HI>; no man can <HI>abhorre</HI> himselfe, without <HI>Shame</HI>; nor <HI>Repent,</HI> without <HI>Sorrow.</HI> Let your honourable patience admit <HI>Iob</HI> descending these foure staires; euen so low as he went; and may all your soules rise as high as he is.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Wherefore.</HEAD>
<P>This referrs vs to the motiue that humbled him; and that appeares by the context, to be a double meditation; one of Gods maiestie, ano|ther of his mercie. 1. Of his maiestie; which being so infinite, and beyond the comprehensi|on of man, hee considered by way of compari|son, or relation to the creatures; the great <HI>Be|h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">moth</HI> of the Land, the greater <HI>Leuiathan</HI> of the Sea; vpon which hee hath spent the precedent Chapters. Mathematicians wonder at the Sun, that it being so much bigger then the Earth, it doth not set it on fire, and burne it to ashes: but here is the wonder; that God being so infinitely great, and wee so infinitely euill, we are not con|sumed. <HI>VVhatsoe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r the Lord would doe,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalm. 135.6.</NOTE> <HI>that did he, in heauen, in earth, in the Sea, and in all deepe places.</HI> If mans power could doe according to his will, or Gods will would doe according to
<PB N="6" REF="6">
his power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Genes. 6.7.</NOTE> who could stand? <HI>I will destroy man from the face of the earth,</HI> saith the <HI>Lord.</HI> The ori|ginall word is, I will <HI>steepe</HI> him, as a man steepes a piece of earth in water, till it tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne to dirt: for man is but clay, and forgets his maker, and his matter. None but God can reduce man to his first principles, and the originall graines where|of he was made: and there is no dust so high, but this great God is able to giue him stee|ping.</P>
<P N="2">2. Or this was a meditation of his mercy, then which nothing more humbles a heart of flesh.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalm. 130.4</NOTE> <HI>VVith thee, O Lord, is forgiuenesse, that thou mightest bee feared.</HI> One would thinke, that pu|nishment should procure feare, and forgiuenesse loue: but <HI>nemo magis diligit, qu&agrave;m qui maxim&egrave; veretur offendere:</HI> no man more truely loues God, then hee that is most fearefull to offend him. <HI>Thy mercie reacheth to the heauens, and thy faithfulnesse to the cloudes</HI>; that is, aboue all sub|limities. God is glorious in all his workes, but most glorious in his workes of mercie: and this may bee one reason, why Saint <HI>Paul</HI> calls the Gospell of Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 1.11.</NOTE> a <HI>Glorious Gospell. Salomon</HI> tels vs, <HI>It is the glory of a man to passe by an offence:</HI> herein is God most <HI>Glorious,</HI> in that he pasleth by all the offences of his children. Lord, who can know thee, and not loue thee; know thee, and not feare thee? feare thee for thy Iustice, and loue thee for thy mercie: yea feare thee for thy mercie, and loue thee for thy Iustice, for thou art infinitely good in both.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">Put both these together, and here is matter of humiliation, euen to <HI>dust and ashes.</HI> So <HI>Abra|ham</HI> interceding for <HI>Sodome</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 18 27.</NOTE> <HI>Behold, I haue ta|ken vpon mee to speake vnto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g. mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">8.</NOTE> <HI>Quanto magis Sancti Diuinitatis interna consp&icirc;ciunt, tanto magis se nihil esse cog|noscu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t.</HI> It is a certaine conclusion; no proud man knowes God. <HI>Non sum dignus, I am not wor|thy,</HI> is the voice of the Saints: they know God, and God knowes them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 33.17.</NOTE> <HI>Moses</HI> was the <HI>meekest</HI> man vpon earth, and therefore God is said <HI>to know him by name.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 32.10.</NOTE> <HI>I am lesse then the least of thy mercies,</HI> saith <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">acob</HI>; loe, hee was honoured to bee Father of the 12.

I am the least of the Apostles,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 15.9.</NOTE> saith <HI>Paul, not worthy to be called an Apostle</HI>: therefore hee is honoured with the title of <HI>The Apostle. Behold the hand|maid of the Lord,</HI> saith the holy Virgin: there|fore shee was honoured to be the Mother of the Lord, and to haue all generations call her <HI>Bles|sed.</HI> This <HI>Non sum dignus,</HI> the humble annihila|tion of themselues, hath gotten them the honor of Saints. In spirituall graces, let vs study to be
<PB N="8" REF="7">
great, and not to know it: as the fixed Starres are (euery one) bigger then the earth, yet ap|peare to vs lesse then torches. <HI>In alto non altum sapere</HI>; not to bee high-minded in high deserts, is the way to blessed preferment. Humilitie is not onely a vertue it selfe, but a vessell to con|taine other vertues: like embers, which keepe the fire aliue that is hidden vnder it. It emptieth it selfe, by a modest estimation of the owne worth, that Christ may fill it. It wrastleth with God, like <HI>Iacob</HI>; and winnes by yeelding: and the lower it stoopes to the ground, the more aduan|tage it gets to obtaine the blessing. All our pride, O Lord, is from the want of knowing Thee: O thou infinite Maker, Reueale thy selfe yet more vnto vs; so shall wee <HI>abhorre our selues, and repent in dust and ashes.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>I abhorre my selfe.</HEAD>
<P>It is a deepe degree of <HI>mortification,</HI> for a man to <HI>abhorre</HI> himselfe. To abhorre others is easie: to deny others, more easie: to despise others, most easie. But it is hard to despise a mans selfe: to deny himselfe, harder: hardest of all, to <HI>abhor</HI> himselfe. Euery one is apt to thinke well, speake well, doe well to himselfe. Not only Charity, a spirituall vertue, but also Lust, a carnall vice, be|gins at home. There is no direct Commande|ment in the Bible, for a man to loue himselfe; be|cause we are all so naturally prone to it. Indeed, we are bound to loue our selues; so much is im|plied in the Precept; <HI>Love thy neighbour as thy selfe</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>August.</HI></NOTE> therefore loue <HI>Thy selfe,</HI> But <HI>Modus praecipi|endus,
<PB N="9" REF="7">
vt tibiprosis</HI>; so loue thy selfe, as to doe thy selfe good. But for a man, vpon good termes, to <HI>abhorre</HI> himselfe; this is the wonder! He is more then a meere Sonne of <HI>Eue,</HI> that does not ouer|value himselfe. <HI>Qui se non admiratur, mirabilis est</HI>: hee that doth not admire himselfe, is a man to be admired.</P>
<P>Nor is this disease of proud flesh, peculiar onely to those persons, whose imperious com|mands, surly salutations, insolent controule|ments, witnesse to the world how little they <HI>ab|horre</HI> themselues. But it haunts euen the baser condition, and fomes out at the common iawes. A proud beggar was the Wisemans monster; but pride is the daughter of Riches. It is against reason, indeed, that metalls should make diffe|rence of men: against religion, that it should make such a difference of Christian men. Yet commonly, Reputation is measured by the acre; and the altitude of Countenance is taken by the Pole of Aduancement. And as the seruant va|lues himselfe higher or lower, according as his master is: so the master esteemes himselfe grea|ter or lesse, according as his master, that is, as his Money or Estate is. His heart is proportio|nably enlarged with his house: his good, and his blood riseth together:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. 4.30.</NOTE> <HI>Is not this the great Baby|lon, which I haue built for the honour of my Maie|stie</HI>? But you know, hee was turned into a <HI>beast</HI> that said so. Gold and siluer are heauy metalls, and sinke downe in the ballance: yet by a prepo|sterous inuersion, they lift the heart of man vp|wards:
<PB N="10" REF="8">
as the plummet of a clocke, which, while it selfe poyseth downewards, lifts vp the striking hammer. As <HI>Saul</HI> vpon his annointing, so many a one vpon his aduancing, is turned quite into another man.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 18.11.</NOTE> <HI>God I thanke thee,</HI> sayes the Pha|risee, <HI>that I am not as other men are, nor as this Publican:</HI> not as other men, and for this hee thankes God: as if because hee thought better of himselfe, God must needs thinke better of him too. Now hee must no more take it as hee hath done; a new port, for a new report. He <HI>ab|horres</HI> all men, but admires himselfe. Yet after these blustring insolencies, and windie ostenta|tions, all this thing is but a man, and that (God knowes) a very foolish one.</P>
<P>But the children of grace haue learned ano|the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> lesson, to thinke well of other men, and to abhor themselues. And indeed, if we consider what Master we haue serued, &amp; what wages de|serued, we haue iust cause to <HI>abhorre</HI> our selues. What part of vs hath not sinned, that it should not merit to be despised? Run all ouer this little <HI>Ile of man,</HI> &amp; find me one me~ber of the body, or faculty of the soule, that can say with <HI>Iobs</HI> mes|senger, <HI>Ego solus aufugi</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob. 1.15.</NOTE> <HI>I alone haue escaped.</HI> What one action can wee iustifie? Produce <HI>ex tot mil|libus, vnum.</HI> Where is that <HI>Innocencie,</HI> which de|sires not to stand onely in the sight of <HI>Mercie?</HI> There is in our worst workes wickednesse, in our best weaknesse, errour in all. What time, what place, are not witnesses against vs? The very Sabbath, the day of Rest, hath not rested from
<PB N="11" REF="8">
our euills. The very Temple, that holy place, hath beene defiled with our obliquities. Our chambers, our beds, our boords, the ground we tread, the ayre wee breath, can tell our follies. There is no occasion, which, if it doe not testifie what euill we haue done, yet can say, what good we should, and haue not done.</P>
<P>If all this do not humble vs, looke we vp (with <HI>Iob</HI> heere) to the Maiestie which we haue offen|d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d. To spoile the Armes of a common Sub+iect, or to counterfeit his Seale, is no such hay|nous or capitall crime. But to deface the Armes of the King, to counterfeit his Broad Seale, or priuy Signet, is no lesse then Treason: be|cause the disgrace redounds vpon the person of the King. Euery sinne dishonors God, &amp; offers to sticke ignominy vpon that infinite Maiestie; therefore deserues an infinite penaltie.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 51.4.</NOTE> <HI>Against thee, O Lord, against thee haue I sinned. I,</HI> thy crea|ture; against <HI>Thee,</HI> my Maker: heere is a trans|cendencie, which when a man considers, hee is worthie to bee abhorred of all men, that does not <HI>abhorre himselfe.</HI></P>
<P>Yet when God, and our owne selues, stand in competition, which do we most respect? Temp|tation is on our left hand, in a beautifull resem|blance, to seduce vs. The will, the glory, the Iudgement of God, is on our right hand, to di|rect vs: doe we now <HI>abhorre</HI> our selues? Com|moditie sets off inquitie, &amp; wooes vs to be rich, though sinners: Christ bids vs first <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ek thee king|dome of Heauen,</HI> and tells vs that other things
<PB N="12" REF="9">
shall come without seeking, <HI>they shall bee added vnto vs:</HI> Doe we now <HI>abhorre</HI> our selues? Such a sinne is pleasing to my lust and concupiscence, but it is displeasing to God and my Conscience: Doe I now <HI>abhorre</HI> my selfe? That wee loue God farre better then our selues, is soone said; but to prooue it, is not so easily done. Hee must <HI>Deny himselfe,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mark. 8.34.</NOTE> that will bee Christs ser|uant. Many haue denied their Masters, many haue denied their Friends, many haue denyed their Kinred, not a few haue denied their Bro|thers, some haue denied their owne Parents, but to <HI>denie themselues, durus hic sermo,</HI> this is a hard taske. <HI>Negare suos, sua, se</HI>; to denie their profits, to deny their pleasures, to denie their lustes, to denie their reasons, to denie themselues? no, to doe all this they vtterly <HI>denie.</HI></P>
<P>Yet hee that repents truely, <HI>abhorres</HI> himselfe; <HI>Non se vt conditum, sed se vt perditum</HI>; not the creature that God made, but the creature that himselfe made. Repentance loues <HI>Animam, non malitiam, carnem, non carnalitatem</HI>; the Soule, not the venime of the soule; the flesh, not the fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">shli|nesse of it. So farre as hee hath corrupted him|selfe, so farre he <HI>abhorres</HI> hims<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lfe; and could ra|ther wish <HI>non esse,</HI> not to be at all, then <HI>malum <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sse,</HI> to be displeasing to his Maker.</P>
<P>Thus, if wee <HI>despise</HI> our selues, God will ho|nour vs: if we <HI>abhorre</HI> our selues, God will <HI>ac|cept</HI> vs: if wee <HI>denie</HI> our selues, God will <HI>acknow|ledge</HI> vs: if wee <HI>hate</HI> our selues, God will <HI>loue</HI> vs: if wee <HI>condemne</HI> our selues, God will <HI>acquite</HI> vs:

<HEAD>I repent.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Repentance</HI> hath much acquaintance in the world, and few friends: it is better knowen then practised; and yet not more knowen, then tru|sted. My scope, now, shall not bee the definiti|on of it, but a perswasion to it. It is euery mans medicine; an vniuersall Antidote, that makes many a <HI>Mithridates</HI> venture on poyson. They make bolde to sinne, as if they were sure to <HI>re|pent.</HI> But the medicine was made for the wound, not the wound for the medicine. Wee haue read, if not seene, the Battell betwixt those two venimous creatures, the Toad and the Spider: where the greater, being ouer-match'd with the poyson of the lesse, hath recourse to a certaine hearbe, some thinke the Plantane; with which shee expells the infection, and renewes the fight: but at last, the hearbe being wasted, the Toad bursts and dies. Wee sucke in sinne, the poyson of that <HI>old Serpent,</HI> and presume to driue it out againe with <HI>Repentance:</HI> but how if this <HI>Hearbe of grace</HI> bee not found in our Gardens? As <HI>Tra|ian</HI> was marching foorth with his armie, a poore woman sollicited him to doe her iustice vpon the murderers of her onely sonne. I will doe thee Iustice, woman, sayes the Emperour, when I returne.

euen, when Repentance comes: but what if <HI>Repentance</HI> neuer comes?</P>
<P>It is not many yeares, more incitations, and abundance of meanes, that can worke it: but <HI>Re|pentance</HI> is the faire gift of God. One would thinke it a short Lesson; yet Israel was fortie yeares a learning it; and they not sooner got it, but presently forgot it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reu. 16.11.</NOTE> <HI>Reu.</HI> 16. We reade of men plagued with <HI>heat,</HI> and <HI>paines,</HI> and <HI>sores</HI>; yet they <HI>repented not. Iudas</HI> could haue a broken necke, not a broken heart. There is no such induce|ment to sinne, as the presumption of ready Re|pentance: as if God had no speciall riches of his owne; but euery sinner might command them at his pleasure. The King hath Earth of his owne, he lets his subiects walke vpon it: he hath a Sea, lets them saile on it: his Land yeelds fruit, let them eate it: his fountaines water, let them drinke it. But the moneys in his Exche|quer, the garments in his Wardrope, the Iewels in his Iewel-house, none may meddle with, but they to whom hee disposeth them. Gods com|mon blessings are not denied:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 5.45.</NOTE> his <HI>Sunne shines,</HI> his <HI>raine falls,</HI> on the righteous and vnrighteous. But the treasures of heauen, the robes of glory, the Iewels of <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Repentance</HI>; these hee keepes in his owne hands; and giues, not where he may, but where he will. Mans heart is like a doore with a Spring locke: pull the doore af|ter you, it lockes of it selfe; but you cannot open it againe without a key. Mans heart doth natu|rally locke our grace;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reuel. 3.7.</NOTE> none but hee that <HI>hath the
<PB N="15" REF="10">
Key of the house of Dauid,</HI> can open the doore, and put it in. God hath made a promise <HI>To</HI> Re|pentance, not <HI>Of</HI> Repentance: wee may trust to that promise, but there is no trusting to our selues. Nature flatters it selfe with that singular instance of mercy; one malefactor on the crosse repenting at his last houre. But such hath beene Satans policie, to draw euill out of good, that the calling and sauing of that one soule, hath bin the occasion of the losse of many thousands.</P>
<P>Wheresoeuer <HI>Repentance</HI> is, shee doth not de|liberate, tarries not to aske questions, and exa|mine circumstances; but bestirres her ioynts, cals her wits &amp; senses together: summons her tongue to praying, her feet to walking, her hands to wor|king, her eyes to weeping, her heart to groaning. There is no need to bid her goe, for shee runnes: she runnes to the word for direction, to her own heart for remorse and compunction, to God for grace and pardon: and wheresoeuer shee find|eth Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Kings 4.30.</NOTE> shee layeth faster hold on him, then the <HI>Shunnamite</HI> did on the feet of <HI>Elisha; As the Lord liueth, and as thy soule liueth, I will not let thee goe:</HI> no <HI>Gehesi</HI> can beate her off. She resolues that her knees shall grow to the pauement, till mercy hath answered her from heauen. As if she had felt an earth quake in her soule, not vnlike that Iaylor, when he felt the foundations of his prison shaken;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 16.29.</NOTE> shee <HI>calls for a light</HI> the Gospell of truth, and <HI>springs</HI> in trembling; and the fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st voice of her lips is, <HI>O what shall I doe to be saued</HI>? Shee lowes with mourning, like the <HI>Kine</HI> that carried
<PB N="16" REF="11">
the <HI>Arke</HI>; and neuer rests till shee comes to <HI>Beth|shemesh,</HI> the fieldes of mercie. The good Starre that guides her, is the promise of God: this giues her light through all the darke clouds of her sorrow. Confidence is her life, and soule: she drawes no other breath then the perswasion of mercie;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 King. 20.31.</NOTE> that the <HI>King of Israel is a mercifull King. Faith</HI> is the heart-blood of <HI>Repentance.</HI> The matter, composition, constitution, sub|stance of it, is amendment of life: there be many counterfets that walke in her habite, as King <HI>A|hab</HI> had his shadowes; but that's her substance. Her countenance is spare and thinne; shee hath not eyes standing out with fatnesse. Her diet is abstinence; her garment and liuery, Sackcloth and ashes: the Paper in her hand, is a Petition; her dialect is <HI>Miser<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re</HI>; and lest her owne lusts should bee bane within her, she sweats them out with confession and teares.</P>
<P>Wee know, there is no other fortification a|gainst the Iudgements of God, but <HI>Repentance.</HI> His forccs be inuisible, inuincible; not repelled with sword and target: neither portcullice, nor fortresse can keepe them out: there is nothing in the world that can encounter them but <HI>Repen|tance.</HI> They had long since laid our honour in the dust, rotted our carkases in the pit, sunke our soules into hell, but for <HI>Repentance.</HI> Which of those Saints, that are now saued in heauen, haue not sinned vpon earth? What could saue them but <HI>Repentance?</HI> Their infirmities are recorded, not onely for the instruction of those that stand,
<PB N="17" REF="11">
but also for the consolation of them that are fal|len. <HI>Instruunt Patriarchae, non sol&ugrave;m docentes, sed &amp; errantes.</HI> They doe not onely teach vs by their Doctrines, but euen by their very errours. <HI>Noah</HI> was ouercome with a little wine, that esca|ped drowning with the world in that Deluge of water. <HI>Lot</HI> was scorched with the flame of vn|naturall lust, that escaped burning in the fire of Sodome, <HI>Sampson,</HI> the strongest; <HI>Salomon,</HI> the wi|sest, fell by a woman. One Balme recouered them all, blessed <HI>Repentance.</HI> Let our soules, from these premises, and vpon the assurance of Gods promises, conclude; that if we <HI>repent,</HI> our sinnes are not greater, Gods mercies cannot bee lesse. Thus was <HI>Niniueh</HI> ouerthrowen, that she might not be ouerthrowen. <HI>Quae peccatis perit, fletibus stetit.</HI> Euery man must either bee a Niniuite, or a Sodomite: a Niniuite sorrowing for sinne, or a Sodomite suffering for sinne. <HI>Doleat peccata reus, vt deleat peccata Deus.</HI> If wee grieue, God will forgiue.</P>
<P>Nor yet must wee thinke, with this one short word (<HI>I repent</HI>) to answere for the multitude of our offences; as if we that had sinned in parcels, should be forgiuen in grosse. It were a rare fa|uour, if we paying but one particular of a whole Booke of debts, should be granted a generall ac|quittance for them all. No, let vs reckon vp our sinnes to God in confession, that our hearts may find a plenary absolution. Nor is it enough to recount them, but wee must recant them. Doe we thinke, that because wee doe not remember
<PB N="18" REF="12">
them, that God hath forgotten them? Are not debts of many yeares standing, to be called for? Mans Iustice doth not forbeare olde offenders: no tract of time can eate out the Characters of blood.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob 13.26.</NOTE> <HI>Thou writest bitter things against me, when thou makest mee to possesse the sinnes of my youth.</HI> These things hast thou done,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 50.21.</NOTE> saith God, and I held my peace: therefore thou thoughtest mee altogether such a one as thy selfe: <HI>but I will re|prooue thee, and set them in order before thine eyes.</HI> Therefore let vs number all the sinnes wee can, and then God will forgiue vs all the sinnes that wee haue.</P>
<P>If wee could truely weigh our iniquities, we must needs find a necessitie, either of <HI>repenting,</HI> or of <HI>perishing.</HI> Shall wee make God to frowne vpon vs in heauen, arme all his creatures against vs on earth? shall w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e force his curses vpon vs and ours? Take his rod, and teach it to scourge vs with all temporall plagues; and not <HI>repent?</HI> Shall wee wound our owne consciences with sinnes, that they may wound vs with eternall torments; make a hell in our bosomes heere, and open the gates of that lower hell to deuoure vs hereafter; and not <HI>repent?</HI> Doe wee, by sinne, giue Satan a right in vs, a power ouer vs, an ad|uantage against vs; and not labour to crosse his mischiefes by <HI>repentance?</HI> Doe wee cast Brim|stone into that infernall fire, as if it could not bee hote enough, or wee should faile of tor|tures except wee make our selues our owne tormentors; and not rather seeke to quench
<PB N="19" REF="12">
those flames with our penitent teares?</P>
<P>If we could see the farewell of sin, we would abhorre it, and our selues for it; Could <HI>Dauid</HI> haue conceiued the griefe of his broken bones, before-hand; he had escaped those aspersions of lust and blood. Had <HI>Achan</HI> foreseene the stones about his eares, before he filch'd those accursed things, hee would neuer haue fingerd them. But it may be said of vs, as it was of our first parents; when they had once sinned and fallen;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Genes. 3.7.</NOTE> <HI>Tunc a|perti sunt oculi eorum, Then their eyes were opened; Then,</HI> not before. In this place comes in <HI>Repen|tance</HI>; as a rectifier of disorders, a recaller of a|berrations, a repairer of all decayes and brea|ches. So it pleaseth Gods mercy, that the daugh|ter should be the death of the mother.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Aug.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Peccatum tristitiam peperit, tristitia peccatum conteret.</HI> Sin bred sorrow, sorrow shall kill sinne: as the oyle of Scorpions healeth the sting of Scorpions.</P>
<P>If I should giue you the picture of <HI>Repentance,</HI> I would tell you, that shee is a <HI>Virgine</HI> faire and louely: and those teares which seeme to doe violence to her beautie, rather indeed grace it. Her Brest is sore with the strokes of her owne penitent hands; which are alwayes, either in <HI>Moses</HI> his posture in the Mount, <HI>lifted vp towards heauen</HI>; or the Publicans in the Temple, <HI>smiting her bosome.</HI> Her knees are hardened with con|stant praying, her voyce is hoarce with calling to heauen; and when shee cannot speake, she de|liuers her mind in groanes. There is not a teare falles from her, but an Angell holds a <HI>bottell</HI> to

catch it. Shee thinkes euery mans sinnes lesse then her owne, euery mans good deeds more. Her compunctions are vnspeakeable; know|en onely to God, and her selfe. Shee could wish, not onely men; but euen beasts, and trees, and stones, to mourne with her. Shee thinks, no Sunne should shine, because shee takes no plea|sure in it; that the Lilies should bee cloathed in black, because she is so apparelled. <HI>Mercy</HI> comes downe, like a glorious <HI>Cherub,</HI> and lights on her bosome, with this message from God; <HI>I haue heard thy prayers, and seene thy teares:</HI> so with a handkerchiefe of comfort, dries her cheeks, and telles her that she is accepted in Iesus Christ.</P>

<P>An adorned body is not the vehicle of an humbled soule. <HI>Iob,</HI> before his affliction was not poore. Doubtlesse, hee had his Wardrobe, his change and choise of garments.

<P>O how goodly this building of man appeares, when it is clothed with beautie and honour! A face full of maiestie, the throne of comelinesse; wherein the whitenesse of the Lilie contends with the sanguine of the Rose: an actiue hand, an erected countenance, an eye sparkling out lu|stre, a smoothe complexion, arising from an ex|cellent temperature and composition: where|as other creatures, by reason of their cold and grosse humours, are growne ouer, beasts with

haire, foules with feathers, fishes with scales. O what a workman was this, that could raise such a Fabricke out of the earth, and lay such orient colours vpon <HI>Dust</HI>! yet all is but <HI>Dust,</HI> walking, talking, breathing <HI>dust:</HI> all this beautie but the effect of a well concocted food, and life it selfe but a walk from <HI>dust</HI> to <HI>dust.</HI> Yea, and this man, or that woman, is neuer so beautifull, as when they sit weeping for their sinnes in the <HI>dust:</HI> as <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> was then fairest, when she knee|led in the <HI>dust,</HI> bathing the feet of Christ with her teares, and wiping them with her haires: like heauen, faire sight-ward, to vs that are with|out; but more faire to them that are within.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dust</HI> is come of the same house that wee are: and when she sees vs proud, and forgetfull of our selues, shee thinkes with her selfe, Why should not shee, that is descended as well as we, beare vp her plumes as high as ours. Therefore she so often borrowes wings of the winde, to mount aloft into the ayre, and in the streets and high wayes, dasheth herselfe into our eyes: as if shee would say, Are you my kinred, and will not know me? will you take no notice of your owne mother? To taxe the folly of our ambi|tion, the <HI>dust</HI> in the street takes pleasure to bee ambitious.</P>
<P>The Iewes in their mourning, vsed to rend their garments; as if they would bee reuenged on them, for encreasing their pride, and keeping them from the sight of their nakednesse. Then they put on sackcloth, and that sackcloth they
<PB N="24" REF="15">
sprinkled ouer with <HI>dust,</HI> and ouerstrawed with <HI>ashes:</HI> to put God in minde, that if hee should arme his displeasure against them, he should but contend with <HI>dust and ashes</HI>; and what glory could that bee for him?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal 30.9.</NOTE> <HI>Shall the dust praise thee, O God; or, art thou glorified in the pit?</HI> Nay, ra|ther, how often doth the Lord spare vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 103.14.</NOTE> <HI>because hee remembers wee are but dust?</HI> To shew that they had lifted vp themselues aboue their crea|tion, and forgot of what they are made; now by by Repentance returning to their first Image, in all prostrate humility they lay in the <HI>dust</HI>; confes|sing, that the wind doth not more easily disperse the <HI>dust,</HI> then the breath of God was able to bring them to nothing.</P>
<P>Thus, <HI>Dust</HI> is not onely <HI>Materia nostra,</HI> or <HI>Ma|ter,</HI> our Mother,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob. 4.19.</NOTE> or matter wherof we are made; for <HI>our foundation is in the dust.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Esai. 26.19.</NOTE> But <HI>Patria nostra,</HI> our Countrey where we shall dwell; <HI>Awake yee that dwell in the dust.</HI> We are no better then the <HI>dust</HI> wee shake off from our feete, or brush off from our clothes.

vs, that wee haue deserued the dissolution of our bodies; <HI>Ashes</HI> put vs in mind that wee haue merited also the destruction of our Soules. <HI>A|shes</HI> are the leauings of the fire, the offalls of consumed substances. When God shall giue vp the largest buildings of Nature to the rage of that Element, it shall reduce them to a nar|rowe roome, the remnants shall bee but <HI>ashes.</HI> This was all the Monument of those famous ci|ties, <HI>Sodome,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Pet. 2.6.</NOTE> <HI>Gomorra,</HI> and the rest; <HI>heapes of ashes.

<P>For this cause, the Ancients vsed to repent in <HI>Ashes</HI>; remonstrating to themselues, that they deserued burning in endlesse fire, more then those <HI>Ashes</HI> wherein they wallowed. Yea, if <HI>Abraham</HI> compared himselfe to <HI>dust and ashes,</HI> I may compare my soule to a <HI>sparke</HI> hid in the <HI>Ashes:</HI> which, when sickenesse and death shall stirre vp; like fire, shee takes her flight vpwards, and leaues the heauy fruitlesse <HI>ashes</HI> of my bodie behind her.</P>
<P>In both, wee haue a L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sson of our owne mortalitie.

Peraduenture so: Will it be mor|tall? Yes, this is without peraduenture; it will die. Euen a Heathen, when hee heard that his son was dead, could say without changing coun|tenance, <HI>Scio me genuisse mortalem</HI>; I know that I begot a mortall man.</P>
<P>An olde man is said to giue <HI>Alexander</HI> a little Iewell; and tolde him, that it had this vertue; so long as hee kept it bright, it would out-value the most fine golde or precious stone in the world; but if it once tooke dust, it would not bee worth a feather.

a Soule,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccl. 9.4.</NOTE> commanded the world; but once fallen to dust, it would be worth nothing: for a <HI>liuing dog is better then a dead Lyon.</HI></P>

<P>_THere bee certaine royall Lawes, which Christ and his Apostles made for eter|nal vse: to the obseruation whereof all Christian Na|tions and persons are vn|changeably bound. And there be some ritual things, which were at the first conuenient, but variable according to the difference of times and places. Strictly to impose all these circumstances on vs, were to make vs, not the sonnes, but the slaues of the Apostles. That is a fond scrupulositie, which would presse vs in all fashions with a conformitie

to the Primitiue times: as if the <HI>Spouse</HI> of Christ might not weare a lace or a border, for which shee could not plead prescription. <HI>Diuersitas ri|tuum commendat vnitatem fidei,</HI> saith our <HI>Anselme.</HI> Let vs keepe the substance; for the shadow, God hath left vs at libertie. But yet when wee looke backe vpon those first patternes, &amp; find a rule of discipline fit for the present times; in vaine wee should study a new, that are so wel accommoda|ted with the old. The businesse of the <HI>Text,</HI> and <HI>Day,</HI> is a <HI>Visitation:</HI> a practice, which at the first view of the words, can plead Antiquitie; and by a reuiew, shall plead the great vtilitie.

<P><HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas.</HI> There is difference, I know, betwixt the Apostles and Bishops. For besides their immediate calling, and extraordinary en|dowments; the Apostles function was an vnlimi+ted circuite, <HI>Ite in vniuersum orbem,</HI> the Bishops is a fixed or positiue residence in one Citie. All those acts, which proceeded from supernaturall priuiledge, ceased with their cause; as the gift of tongues, of miracles,&amp; the like.

<P>Take away difference, and what will follow, but an Anabaptisticall ataxie or confusion?

<P>Bishops are <HI>brethren</HI> to Ministers in a three-fold relation. 1. By nature, so are all men. 2. By grace, so are all Christians. 3. By office, so are all Pastors.

So in the State Ecclesiasticall, in respect of the ge|nerall seruice of Christ, the dispensation of his Word and Mysteries, Bishops and Priests are all <HI>Brethren,</HI> and fellow-Presbyters: yet though the Stiles be communicable, the termes are not con|vertible: for euery Bishop is a Priest, but euery Priest is not a Bishop.

We see in our Parishes strange motions; a drunken compa|nion bearding his Minister, a contentious Incen|diary vexing him with actions and slanders: an obstinate Papist carries away his Recusancie, scornes the Preacher, seduceth the people: this is a strange kinde of Puppet play: but God knowes who it is behind the curtaine, that giues them their motion: onely we are sure, they can|not thus moue themselues. There are many mee|tings, and much adoe, as if sinne should be puni+shed: a Iury is impannell'd, a sore charge is gi|uen: the drunkard shall bee made an example, Good-ale shall be talk'd with, whoredome shall

be whipt, and all shall be well: we looke for pre|sent reformation. But it commonly proues like the Iugglers feast in <HI>Suidas</HI>; a Table furnished with all manner of dainties in shew, wherof when they came to taste, they found nothing but aire. But I passe from the <HI>Extent,</HI> to</P>

<HEAD>The Limitation, <HI>or</HI> restraint of it.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Where wee haue preached the Word of the Lord.</HI> Not <HI>euery citie,</HI> but euery citie and place that hath receiued the word of Instruction. No <HI>visi|ting</HI> a Garden, but where some seeds haue beene planted: that which is all weeds, is left to an higher visitation;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 3.13.</NOTE> <HI>God shall iudge them that are without.</HI> One would think that the word of God were so preuailing, that it should beat downe e|normities faster then Satan can raise them. But wee finde by miserable experience, that euen in those cities where the Gospell hath abounded, sinne hath superabounded; and that this glorious Sun hath not dispelled and ouercome all those fogges and mists that haue surg'd from hell. But if the Sunne cause a stench, it is a signe there is some dunghill nigh: let it reflect vpon a bed of Roses, there is all sweetnesse.</P>
<P>Shall wee lay the blame vpon the Preachers? that were vniust in our owne consciences. What Citie in the world is so rich in her spirituall pro|uision, as this? Some whole countreyes within the Christian pale, haue not so many learned and painefull Pastors, as bee within these walles and liberties. It lookes light the firmament in a cleare night, bespangled with refulgent starres,

of different magnitude, but all yeelding com|fortable light, <HI>to guide our feet in the way of peace.</HI> The Church in <HI>Constantinople,</HI> wherein <HI>Nazian|zen</HI> preached, was called <GAP DESC="foreign"> the <HI>Resurrection Church</HI>; in respect of the great concourse and as|sembly of people. Most Churches in this Citie may well beare that name. Where is the fault then? I could happily tel you of some causes: the great profanation of Gods Sabbath, the perfun|ctory hearing of his sacred word, the cages of vncleane birds, Brothels and drinking Schooles, the negligence of the secular Magistrate, the ex|emplary corruption of Rulers, the sinfull indul|gence of parents and matters in their families, when the mouths of their children and seruants bee filled with vncorrected oathes and blasphe|mies. O that wee might see an end of these things, before wee see an end of all things. The last poynt is,</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Intent, <HI>or</HI> end of all</HEAD>
<P><HI>To see how they doe.</HI> First, to see how the Pa|stors doe, whom they had set ouer particular Congregations. The Apostles had been carefull in their first election; and good reason; <HI>Lay hands suddenly vpon no man,</HI> saith Saint <HI>Paul.</HI> There is a Story in the Legend, how a Bishop deuoted to the seruice of our Lady, in the agony of death, prayed her to bee his Mediator, as hee had been her Chaplaine. To whom she answered, that for his other sinnes she had obtained pardon, but his rash imposition of hands, was a case which her Sonne would reserue to hims<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lfe. But some that
<PB N="48" REF="27">
were fit in the choise, may prooue vnworthy in the progresse; therefore must be visited, to <HI>see how they doe.</HI> For if the Physician be sicke, what shall become of his patients? Certainly, a Ministers life is full of honour heere and hereafter too, so it is full of danger heere and heereafter too. O what an honour is it to labour in Gods har|uest, to bee an Ambassador from Christ, to re|mit and retaine sinnes, to dresse and leade the Bride, to sit on thrones, and iudge the nations? Againe, what a danger is it to answere for soules lost by our silence, to bee guilty of blood, by ei|ther teaching, or liuing amisse? For howsoeuer the doctrine it selfe bee the Light, yet the Prea|chers life is the Lanthorne that carries it, and keepes it from blowing out: and it is an easier defect to want Latine or learning, then to want honestie and discretion. God hath giuen vs the <HI>Keyes</HI>; but if they rust vpon our hands, whether through foule carriage, or want of vse, they will but serue to lock our selues out of doores. Ther|fore we must submit to a Visitation.</P>
<P><HI>How they doe.</HI> What must it be examined, what store of soules they haue conuerted? No, it is the measure, not the successe, that God looks to. Saint <HI>Paul</HI> himselfe doth not say, <HI>Plus profui om|nibus,</HI> I did more good then the rest:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.10.</NOTE> but <HI>Plus la|borani omnibus,</HI> I tooke more paines then the rest. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> laboured more abundantly then they all.</HI> Our <HI>re|ward</HI> shal be <HI>according to our works,</HI> not according to the fruit of our workes.

We giue God what we haue, he askes vs no more: this is enough to honour him, and reward vs.</P>
<P><HI>How they doe.</HI> What, how they thriue in their temporals, what riches or preferments be giuen them? no, as this is none of our ambition, so it is none of our lucke or portion. Men sucke our milke, like Mules, and then kicke vs with their heeles. <HI>Cominaeus</HI> sayes, he that would be a Fauo|rite, must not haue a hard name, that so he might bee easily remembred, when promotions are a dealing. It seemes that Preachers haue hard names, for none remember them in the poynt of benefit. The world regards them, as poore folks doe their children; they would bee loth to haue any more of them, because they are troubled to maintaine them they haue. In <HI>Ier<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">boams</HI> time the lowest of the people were made Priests, &amp; now Priests are made the lowest of the people. A lay|man, like a Mathematicall line, runs on <HI>ad infini|tum:</HI> onely the Preacher is bound to his compe|tencie, yea, and defrauded of that. But let all preferments goe, so long as wee can find prefer|ment in your consciences, and bee the instru|ments of your saluation, we are content.</P>
<P><HI>How they doe.</HI> Not onely the Pastors, but euen all the <HI>Brethren</HI>; their errors must also be looked into. S. <HI>Paul</HI> mentions the house of <HI>Clo&ecirc;,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.
<PB N="50" REF="28">
<HI>It hath been declared to me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 1.11.</NOTE> by them which are of the house of Clo&ecirc;, that there are contentions</HI> and faults <HI>among you</HI>; from thence hee had information of their disorders. Answerable to which, we haue Church-wardens, they are the house of <HI>Clo&ecirc;,</HI> bound by oath to present misdemeanors, that sins may haue their iust censure. Let them on the one side, take heed of splene, that they do nothing maliciously. So their accusation may be iust, and their affection vniust: &amp; in doing that they shall sin, which they had sinned in not doing. <HI>Ill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t poenam, tu amisisti laudem.</HI> On the other side: of conniuence and partialitie; for there is an <HI>Omnia ben&egrave;</HI> that swallowes all vanities. Drunkennes, vn|cleannes, swearing, profanation of the Sabbath, goe abroad all the yeare; and when the Visitati|on comes, they are lock'd vp with an <HI>Omnia bene.</HI> This is not that Charitie that <HI>couereth sinne,</HI> but a miserable indulgence that cherisheth sinne.</P>
<P>In the Creation there was an <HI>Omnia bene</HI>; God reviewed all his workes, and they were <HI>exceeding good.</HI> In our Redemption there was an <HI>Omnia be|ne; He hath done all things well, hee hath made the Blinde to see, and the Lame to goe</HI>; a iust confes|sion &amp; applause. Here was an <HI>Omnia bene</HI> indeed, but there neuer was an <HI>Omnia bene</HI> since.</P>
<P>Let there bee therefore a Visitation with the Rod, lest God come to visite with f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re. God hath a fourefold Visitation. 1. A Visitation of Grace and Mercie:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 1.68.</NOTE> <HI>Visitauit &amp; redemit, He hath visited and redeemed his people.</HI> He came not onely to see vs, but to saue vs: not only to liue among vs, but

Lastly, a visitation of wrath and fury;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iere. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.29.</NOTE> <HI>Shall I not visite for these things, saith the Lord?

<PB N="52" REF="29">
this shall bee the portion of their cup.</P>
<P>Gods visitation cannot be eluded or auoyded; there will be no appealing to a higher Court, no reuoking by Prohibitions, no hiding from the censure, no corrupting the Iudge, no answering the matter by Proxie, no commuting the penal|tie; no preuenting, but either by liuing innocent, or dying penitent.</P>
<P>Therefore let vs all visite our selues, that wee may saue God the labour. This is a dutie to which wee are all naturally backward: like Ele|phants, that chuse troubled waters, and refuse to drinke in cleare springs, for feare of seeing their owne deformities. Or vnthrifts, that are run so farre in arrerages, they are loth to heare of a rec|koning. Or, it may bee, we haue chiding consci|ences; and then, like those that are troubled with curst and scolding wiues at home, loue to be ram|bling abroad. But it is better to haue our wounds searched while they are greene, then to haue our limbes cut off for being festered. Descend wee then, into the depth and corners of our owne hearts; let vs begin our visitation there; mortify|ing all our rebellious lusts, and subduing our affe|ctions to the will of our Maker. So onely shall wee passe cleare and vncondemned by the <HI>great Bishop of our Soules, Iesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>I haue done; <HI>Deo gloria, vobis gratia, mihi venia. Amen.</HI></P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>ACTES. 1.24.</BIBL>
<P>And they prayed; and said, Thou Lord, which know|est the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THe businesse of the day is an <HI>Election</HI>; an election into one of the most No|ble Offices of the Kingdome; the go|uernment of this Honourable Citie, which (let not enuie heare it) hath no parallel vnder the Sunne. The businesse of my Text is an <HI>Election</HI> too; an election into the highest office in the Church, to be an <HI>Apostle</HI> and <HI>Witnesse</HI> of Iesus Christ. If you please to spare the paterne in foure circumstances; as, 1. This office is spiritual, yours temporall. 2. This place was voyd by A|postasie or decession, yours is supplied by succes|sion. 3. This election is by Lots, yours is by Suf|frages. 4. This choice was but one of two, it may be your number exceeds: the rest will sute well enough, and the same God that was in the one, be also present in the other, by the assistance of his holy spirit.</P>
<PB N="56" REF="31">
<P>The argument of the Text is a prayer to God for his direction in their choice: yea indeed, that hee would chuse a man for them: including a strong reason of such a request, because he doth <HI>know the hearts of all men.</HI></P>
<P>They begin with <HI>prayer</HI>; this was the vsuall ma|ner in the Church of God. So <HI>Moses</HI> prayed for the choice of his Successor.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Num. 27.16.</NOTE> <HI>Let the Lord, the God of the spirits of all flesh set a man ouer the Congrega|tion.</HI> Christ sent not his Apostles to that holy work,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn 17.27.</NOTE> without a prayer&punc; <HI>Sanctifie them through thy truth.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Actes 6.6.</NOTE> In the chusing of those seuen Deacons, they first prayed, and then <HI>laid their hands vpon them.</HI> Thus were Kings Inaugurated, with <HI>Sacri|fice</HI> and <HI>Prayer.</HI> It is not fit, he that is chosen for God, should bee chosen without God. But for this, <HI>Samuel</HI> himselfe may be mistaken, and chuse seuen wrong, before hee hit vpon the right. In this; I cannot but commend your religious care; that businesses of so great a consequence be al|wayes sanctified with a blessing. Those which in a due proportion, must represent God to the world, ought to be consecrated to that Maiestie which they resemble, by publike deuotions. E|uery important action requires <HI>Prayer,</HI> much more that which concernes a whole citie. When <HI>Samuel</HI> came to <HI>Bethlehem</HI> to annoynt <HI>Dauid,</HI> he calls the whole Citie to the Sacrifice. Indeed the Family of <HI>Iesse</HI> was sanctified in a more spe|ciall manner: this businesse was most theirs, and all Israels in them. The feare of God should take full possession of all our hearts, that are this day
<PB N="57" REF="31">
assembled: but those with whom God hath more to doe then with the rest, should bee more holy then the rest.</P>
<P>The choice of your Wardens and Masters in your seuerall Companies hath a solemne forme; and it is the honour of your greatest Feasts, that the first dish is a Sermon. Charitie forbid, that any should think, you admit such a Custome, ra|ther for conuenience then deuotion&punc; as if Prea|ching were but a necessary complement to a So|lemnitie, as Wine and Musicke. I am perswaded better things of you: but if there should be any such peruerse spirits, that like the Gouernor of a people called <HI>Aequi,</HI> when the Romans came to him, <HI>Iussit c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s ad quercum dicere,</HI> bade them speak to the Oake, for he had other businesse: but they replied, <HI>Et h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">c sacrataquercus andiat f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dus a v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bis violatum</HI>; let this Oake beare witnesse, that you haue broke the league which you haue couenan|ted. So when we come to preach to your soules, if you should secretly bid vs speake to the walls; loe euen the very walls will be witnesses against you at the last day. Though <HI>Saul</HI> be King ouer <HI>Samuel,</HI> yet <HI>Samuel</HI> must teach <HI>Saul</HI> how to bee King. Wee may instruct; though wee may not rule; yea, wee must instruct them that shall rule. Therefore as wee obey your call in comming to speake, so doe you obey Gods command in vouchsafing to heare. Let vs apply our selues to him with deuotion, and then hee will bee graci|ously present at our Election.</P>

<P>Omnipotence; Lord. Wee acknowledge thy right, thou art fit to bee thine owne chuser. <HI>Lord,</HI> there bee many on earth called Lords; but those are Lords of earth, and those Lords are earth, &amp; those Lords must returne to earth. This Lord is Almightie; raising out of the dust to the hon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur of Princes, and <HI>laying the honour of Prin|ces in the dust. Lord,</HI> of what? nay, not qualifi|ed; not Lord of such a Countie, Barony, Seigni|orie; nor Lord by vertue of Office and Deputa|tion: but <HI>in abstracto,</HI> most absolute: His <HI>Lord|ship</HI> is vniuersall: <HI>Lord</HI> of heauen, the owner of those glorious mansions: <HI>Lord</HI> of earth, disposer of all Kingdomes and Principalities: <HI>Lord</HI> of hell, to locke vp the old Dragon and his crew in the bottomlesse pit: <HI>Lord</HI> of Death, to vnlocke the graues: hee keepes the Key, that shall let all bodies out of their earthy prisons. A potent <HI>Lord</HI>; whither shall we goe to get out of his Do|minion? To heauen?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 139.7. &amp;c</NOTE> there wee cannot misse him: To hell? there wee cannot bee without him: In ayre, earth, or sea; in light or darknesse, wee are sure to finde him. Whither then, except to Purgatory? That <HI>Terra incognita</HI> is not men|tioned in his <HI>Lordship:</HI> the Pope may keepe the
<PB N="59" REF="32">
key of that himselfe. But for the rest, hee is too sawcie; exalting his vniuersal Lordship, and hed|ging in the whole Christian world for his Dio|cesse. Stretching his arme to heauen, in rubric|king what Saints he lift: to hell, in freeing what prisoners hee lift: on earth, in setting vp, or pul|ling downe what Kings hee list: but that some haue cut short his busie fingers.</P>
<P>To the <HI>Lord</HI> of all they commend the choyce of his owne seruants. Euery mortall Lord hath this power in his owne Family: how much more that <HI>Lord,</HI> which makes Lords? who is so fit to chuse, as he that can chuse the fit? Who so fit to chuse, as hee that can make those fit whom he doth chuse? It is He alone that can giue po|wer and grace to the elected, therefore not to be left out in the election. How can the Apostle preach, or the Magistrate gouerne, without him; when none of vs all can mooue but in him? It is happy, when wee doe remit all doubts to his decision, and resigne our selues to his dispositi|on. Wee must not be our owne Caruers, but let Gods choyce be ours. When we know his plea|sure, let vs shew our obedience. And for you, vpon whom this Election falls, remember how you are bound to honour that Lord of heauen, that hath ordained such honour for you vpon earth: that so in all things wee may glorifie his blessed Name.</P>
<P>Omniscience: it is Gods peculiar, to bee the searcher of the heart. <HI>The heart of man is deceit|full aboue all things, and desperately wicked; who
<PB N="60" REF="33">
can know it?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iere. 17.9.10.</NOTE> Who? <HI>Eg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Domi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s, I the Lord search the heart.</HI> Hee hath made no window in|to it, for man or Angel, to looke in: onely it hath a doore, and he keepes the key himselfe.</P>
<P>But why the <HI>Heart?</HI> Here was an Apostle to bee chosen: now wisdome, learning, eloquence, memorie, might seeme to bee more necessary qualities, then the <HI>Heart.</HI> No, they are all no|thing to an honest <HI>Heart.</HI> I denie not, but Lear|ning to diuide the Word, Elocution to pro|nounce it, Wisdome to discerne the truth, Bold|nesse to deliuer it, bee all parts requireable in a Preacher. But as if all these were scarse worth mention in respect of the <HI>Heart</HI>; they say not, Thou that knowest which of them hath the sub|tiler wit, or abler memory; but which hath the truer heart: not which is the greater Scholer, but which is the better man; <HI>Thou that knowest the Heart.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Samuel</HI> being sent to annoynt a sonne of <HI>Iesse,</HI> when <HI>Eliab,</HI> the eldest came foorth, a man of a goodly presence, fit for his person to succeed <HI>Saul</HI>; he thinkes with himselfe, This choyce is soone made, sure this is the head vpon which I must spend my holy Oyle. The priuiledge of Nature and of Stature, his primogeniture and proportion giues it him; This is hee. But euen the holyest Prophet, when hee speakes without God, runnes into errour. Signes and apparances are the guides of our eyes; and these are seldome without a true falshood, or an vncertaine truth. <HI>Saul</HI> had a goodly person, but a bad heart: hee
<PB N="61" REF="33">
was higher then all, many were better then hee. It is not hard for the best Iudgement to erre in the shape. <HI>Philox<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">menes,</HI> a magnanimous and valiant Souldier, being inuited to <HI>Magyas</HI> his house to dinner, came in due season, but found not his Host at home. A seruant seeing one so plaine in clothes, and somewhat defor|med in bodie, thought him some sorry fellow, and set him to cleaue wood. Whereat <HI>Magyas</HI> (being returned) wondering, he receiued from him this answere; <HI>Expendo poenas deformitatis meae</HI>; I pay for my vnhandsomnesse. All is not valour, that lookes bigge, and goes braue. Hee that iudgeth by the inside, checked <HI>Samuel</HI> for his misconceit;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 16.7.</NOTE> <HI>Looke not on his Countenance or Stature, for I haue refused him: for the Lord seeth not as man seeth. Dauids</HI> countenance was inge|nuous and beautifull, but had it promised so much as <HI>Eliabs</HI> or <HI>Abinadabs,</HI> hee had not been left in the field, while his Brethren sate at the table. <HI>Iesse</HI> could find nothing in <HI>Dauid</HI> worthy the competition of honour with his brethren: God could finde something to preferre him be|fore them all. His father thought him fit to keepe sheepe, thought his Brethren fit to rule men. God thinkes him fit to rule, and his Bre|thren to serue; and by his owne immediate choyce destines him to the Throne. Here was all the difference; <HI>Samuel</HI> and <HI>Iesse</HI> went by the outside, God by the inside: they saw the com|position of the body, hee the disposition of the mind. Israel desires a King of God, and that
<PB N="62" REF="34">
King was chosen by the Head: God will chuse a King for Israel, and that King is chosen by the <HI>Heart.</HI> If in our choyce for God, or for our selues, wee altogether follow the eye, and suffer our thoughts to be guided by outward respects, we shall be deceiued.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1"> Why doe they not say, <HI>Thou that knowest</HI> the estates of men, who is rich, and fit to support a high place; and who so poore that the place must support him?

To speake morally, Actiue worth is better then Passiue; this last we haue from our Ancestors, the first from our selues.

So <HI>Cain</HI> answered God, when hee que|stioned him about <HI>Abel, Am I my Brothers kee|per?</HI> As if hee would say, Goe looke. 4. It di|uided tongue from tongue, at the building of <HI>Babell</HI>; that when one called for Bricke, his fel|low brings him morter: and when hee spake of comming downe, the other falles a remoouing the ladder. 5.

fore-gates are shut against it. This makes many aspire to Offices and great places, not to doe good, but to get goods; as some loue to bee stir|ring the fire, if it bee but to warme their owne fingers. Whatsoeuer affaires passe through their hands, they crooke them all to their owne endes; and care not what becomes of the pub|like good, so they may aduance their owne pri|uate: and would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et their neighbours house on fire, and it were but to rost their owne egges. Let them banish Couetousnesse, with as great a hatred as <HI>Amnon</HI> did <HI>Thamar</HI>; first thrust it out of their hearts, then shut and locke the dore after it: for the couetous heart is none of them that God chuseth.</P>
<P>Next let vs see what kinde of hearts of God will chuse; and they be furnished with these vertues fit for a Magistrate.</P>
<P N="1">1. There is <HI>Cor sapiens,</HI> a wise heart; and this was <HI>Salomons</HI> suite;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Kings 3.9.</NOTE> <HI>An vnderstanding heart.</HI> Hee saw, hee had power enough, but not wise|dome enough; and that Royaltie without wise|dome, was no better then an eminent disho|nour; a very Calfe made of golden Eare-rings. There is no Trade of life, but a peculiar wise|dome belongs to it; without which all is tedi|ous and vnprofitable: how much more to the highest and busiest vocation, the gouernment of men? An ignorant ruler is like a blind Pilot; who shall saue the vessell from ruine?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Cor patiens</HI>; a meeke heart: what is it to discerne the cause, and not to bee patient of the
<PB N="70" REF="38">
proceedings? The first Gouernour that God set ouer his Israel, was <HI>Moses</HI>; a man of the meekest spirit vpon earth. How is hee fit to gouerne o|thers, that hath not learn'd to gouerne himselfe? He that cannot rule a Boat on the riuer, is not to bee trusted with steering a Vessell on the Ocean. Nor yet must this patience degenerate into co|wardlinesse: <HI>Moses</HI> that was so meeke in his owne cause, in Gods cause was as resolute. So there is also</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Cor magnanimum,</HI> a heart of fortitude and courage. The rulers and squares that regulate others, are not made of lead or soft wood, such as will bend or bow. The principall Columnes of a house, had need be heart of Oke. A timo|rous and flexible Magistrate is not fit for these corrupt times. If either threatnings can terri|fie him, or fauour melt him, or perswasions swerue him from Iustice, hee shall not want temptations. The Braine that must dispell the fumes, ascending from a corrupt liuer, stomach, or spleene, had need bee of a strong constitu|tion. The couragious spirit that resolues to doe the will of heauen, what malignant powers soe|uer would crosse it on earth, is the heart God chuseth.</P>
<P N="4">4. Lastly, there is <HI>Cor. honestum,</HI> an honest heart. Without this, courage will prooue but legall Iniustice, policie but meere subtiltie, and abilitie but the Deuills Anuile to forge mis|chiefes. Priuate men haue many curbes; but men in authoritie, if they feare not God, haue
<PB N="71" REF="38">
nothing else to feare. If hee bee a simple Da|stard, hee feares all men: if a head-strong com|mander, he feares no man; like that vniust Iudge, that <HI>feared neither God nor Man.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 18.2.</NOTE> This is the ground of all fidelitie to King and Countrey, Religion. Such was <HI>Constantines</HI> Maxime; Hee cannot bee faithfull to mee, that is vnfaithfull to God. As this honourable place of the Kings Lieutena~t-ship hath a Sword-bearer, so the Ma|gistrate himselfe is the <HI>Lords Sword-bearer,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 13.4.</NOTE> saith Saint <HI>Paul.</HI> And as hee may neuer drawe this Sword in his priuate quarrell, so hee must not let if bee sheathed when Gods cause calls for it. It is lenitie and conniuence that hath inuited con|tempt to great places. Did Iustice carrie a se|uerer hand, they durst not traduce their Rulers in Songs and Saty<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, the burden whereof will bee their owne shame. Magistrates are our ci|uill Fathers: and what deserue they but the curse of <HI>Cham,</HI> that lay open the nakednesse of <HI>their Fathers?</HI> When <HI>Alexander</HI> had conque|red <HI>Darius,</HI> and casually found his slaine bodie lying naked, hee threw his owne coat ouer him, saying, I will couer the destinie of a King. It is God alone that <HI>casteth contempt vpon Princes</HI>; which that hee may not doe, let them preserue <HI>Cor mundum,</HI> a cleane heart, not conscious of ill demerits.</P>
<P>Such a one sits on the Iudgement-Seat, as one that neuer forgets that hee must appeare before the Iudgement-Seate of Christ. So hee execu|teth Iustice, as neuer losing the sense of Mercy:
<PB N="72" REF="39">
so hee sheweth Mercie, as not offering violence to Iustice, Hee can at once, punish the offence, and pitie the offender, Hee remembers his oath, and feares to violate it: to an enemie hee is not cruell, to a friend hee will not bee partiall. And if euer hee haue but once cut the skirt of Iustice, as <HI>Dauid</HI> the lappe of <HI>Sauls</HI> garment, his <HI>Heart smites him</HI> for it. Hee minds no other clocke on the Bench, but that of his owne Conscience. Hee will not offend the Iust, nor affoord a good looke to varlets: nor yet doth hee so d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sregard their persons, as to wrong their causes. Hee will maintaine Pietie, but not neglect Equitie. In Court, hee lookes not before him on the per|son, nor about him on the beholders, nor behind him for bribes; nay, hee will not touch them in his Cloffer or Chamber, lest the timber and stones in the wall should-witnesse against him. So hee helpes the Church, that the Common-wealth bee no loser: so hee lookes to the Com|mon-wealth, that the Church may not bee wronged. The lewd feare him, the good praise him, the poore blesse him; hee hath been a Fa|ther to Orphans, a Husband to distressed Wi|dowes. Many prayers are layde vp for him in Heauen; and when hee dies, they with the as|sist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nce of Angels, shall beare him vp to bles|sednesse.</P>
<P>Lastly, let vs see why God will chuse men by the heart. I denie not, but wisedome and cou|rage, moderation and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">atience, are all requisite concur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ences: but the <HI>Heart</HI> is the <HI>Primum
<PB N="73" REF="39">
Mobile,</HI> that sets all the wheeles a going, and im|prooues them to the right end. When God be|gins to make a man good, he begins at the heart: as Nature in forming, so God in reforming, be|gins there. As the eye is the first that begins to die, and the last that begins to liue: so the heart is the first that liues, and the last that dies. It is said of the Spider, that in the morning, before shee seekes out for her prey, shee mends her bro|ken webbe; and in doing that, she alwayes begins in the midst. Before wee pursue the profits and baits of this world, let vs first amend our life; and when wee vndertake this, let vs bee sure to begin at the heart. The <HI>Heart</HI> is the Fort or Ci|tadell in this little Ile of man; let vs fortifie that, or all will bee lost. And as naturally, the heart is first in being, so here the Will (which is meant by the Heart) is chiefe in commanding. The Centurions seruants did not more carefully o|bey him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math 8.9.</NOTE> when hee sayd to one <HI>Goe, and he goeth, to another Come, and hee commeth, to a third, Doe this, and hee doth it:</HI> then all the members ob|serue the <HI>Heart</HI>; if it say to the eye, See, it seeth: to the eare, Heare, it hearkeneth: to the tongue, Speake, it speaketh: to the foot, Walke, it wal|keth: to the hand, Worke, it worketh. If the <HI>Heart</HI> lead the way to God, not a member of the body, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a facultie os the soule, will stay be|hinde. As when the Sunne ariseth in the mor|ning, Birds rise from their nestes, Beastes from their dennes, and Men from their beds. They all say to the <HI>Heart,</HI> as the Israelites did to <HI>Io|shuah;

<P>No part of man can sinne without the heart, the heart can sin without all the rest. The Wolfe goes to the flocke, purposing to deuoure a Lambe, and is preuented by the vigilancie of the Shepheard; yet <HI>Lupus exit, Lupus regreditur</HI>; hee went foorth a Wolfe, and comes home a Wolfe. The heart intends a sinne, which is ne|uer brought into action; yet it sinnes in that ve|ry intention. The hand cannot offend without the heart, the heart can offend without the hand. The heart is like a Mill: if the winde or water bee violent, the Mill will goe whether the Miller will or not; yet hee may chuse what kind of graine it shall grind, wheat or darnell. If the affections bee strong and passionate, the heart will bee working: yet the Christian by grace, may keepe out lustes, and supply it with good thoughts.</P>
<P>The <HI>Heart</HI> is Gods peculiar; the thing hee e|specially cares for: <HI>My sonne, giue mee thy heart:</HI> and good reason, for I gaue my owne Sonnes heart to death for it. <HI>Non minus tuum, quia me|um</HI>; It is not lesse thine, for being mine: yea, it cannot be thine comfortably, vnlesse it bee mine perfectly.

<P>If wee compare this Citie with many in for|raine parts, how ioyfully may wee admire our owne happines! Those murders and massacres, rapes and constuprations, and other mischiefes, that bee there as common as nights, be rare with vs. I will not say that all our people are better then theirs, I dare say, our Gouernment is bet|ter then theirs. Merchants make higher vse, and are more glad of calme Seas, then common pas|sengers. So should Christians more reioyce in peace, then can the heathen: because they know how to improoue it to richer ends, the glory of God, and saluation of their owner soules. Pro|ceed yee graue and honourable Senatours, in your former approoued courses, to the suppres|sing of vice and disorders, and to the mainte|nance of Truth and Peace among vs. It is none of the least renownes of this famous Citie, the

Wisedome and Equitie of the Gouernours. To repeat the worthy acts done by the <HI>Lords Maiors</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> were fitter for a Chronicle; they are too large for a Sermon.</P>
<P>But it is high time to blesse you with a Dis|mission, and to dismisse you with a Blessing. That Almightie God, <HI>that knowes the hearts of all,</HI> sanctifie your hearts to gouerne, and ours to obey; that wee all seeking to doe good one to another, <HI>He</HI> may doe good vnto vs all.

<P>_I Neither affect those Rheumaticke Pennes, that are still dropping vpon the Presse: nor those Phlegmaticke spirits, that will scarse bee coniur'd into the orbe of employment. But if modest forwardnesse be a fault, I cannot excuse my selfe.</P>
<P>It pleased God Almighty, to make a fearefull Comment on this his owne Text, the very same day it was preached by his vnworthiest seruant. The argument was but audible in the morning, before night it was visible. His holy Pen had long since written it with inke, now his hand of Iustice expounded it in the Characters of bloud, There, was onely a conditionall menace, So it shall be: here a terrible remonstrance, So it is. Sure! He did not meane it for a nine daies won|der. Their sudden departure out of the World, must not so suddenly depart from the memorie of the World. Woe to that soule that shall take so slight a notice of so extraordinary a Iudge|ment. We doe not say, They perished: Chari|tie forbid it. But this wee say, It is a signe of Gods fauour, when hee giues a man Law. Wee
<PB REF="46">
passe no sentence vpon them, yet let vs take war|ning by them. The Remarkablenesse would not be neglected&punc; for the Time, the Place, the Per|sons, the Number, the Maner. Yet still wee conclude not, This was for the transgression of the dead: but this we are sure of, It is meant for the admonition of the liuing.</P>
<P>Such is our Blessed Sauiours conclusion, vpon a paralel instance: <HI>Except ye repent, YE shal all LIKEWISE perish.</HI> There is no place safe. e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ough for offenders: but when the Lord is once vp in armes, happy man that can make his owne peace! otherwise, in vaine we hope to runne from the Plague, while we carry the Sinne along with vs. Yet will not our wilfull and bewitched Recu|sants, from these legible Characters, spell Gods plaine meaning. No impression can bee made in those hearts, that are ordained to perish. For their malicious, causelesse, and vnchristian censures of vs, God forgiue them: our requitall be onely pitie and prayers for them. Howsoeuer they giue out, (and I will not here examine) that their piety is more then ours: Impudence it selfe cannot de|nie, but our Charitie is greater then theirs. Now the holy feare of God keepe vs in the wayes of Faith and Obedience; that the properation of Death may neuer preuent our preparation to die. And yet still, after our best endeauor; <HI>From sudden death good Lord deliuer vs all.</HI> Amen.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>LVKE. Cap. 13. Vers. 7.</BIBL>
<P>Then said hee to the Dresser of his Vine|yard; Behold, these three yeares I come seeking fruit on this Fig-tree, and find none: cut it downe, why cumbreth it the ground?</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_NEwes is brought to Christ, of a certaine Iudgement, which was not more <HI>Pilates,</HI> then Gods, vpon some Gali|leans; who, while they were sacrificing, were sacrificed; their blood being mingled with the blood of the beasts,
<PB N="2" REF="47">
on the same altar. Lest this should be whol|ly attributed to <HI>Pilates</HI> crueltie, without due respect had of the omnipotent Iustice, hee samples it with another; of eighteene men miscarrying by the fall of a Tower. No <HI>Pi|late</HI> threw downe this, here was no humane Executioner: the matter of their death was morter and stones, these had no purpose to kill them. This therefore, must bee an inui|sible hand, working by an insensible creature: the Instrument may bee diuers, the Iudge is the same.</P>
<P>Now, <HI>Poena paucorum, terror omnium:</HI> as an exhalation drawne from the earth, fired and sent backe againe to the earth, smites onely one place, but terrifieth the whole countrey. So their ruines should be our ter|rours, let them teach vs, that they may not touch vs. They are hitherto but like <HI>Moses</HI> his <HI>Rodde</HI> turned into a Serpent: not into a Beare or Lyon, lest it should haue deuoured <HI>Pharaoh:</HI> but into a Serpent, that hee might be more afraid then hurt. It is Gods speciall fauour to vs, that others bee made examples for vs, and not wee made examples for o|thers. Nothing could teach them, let them teach vs.</P>
<P>Of these fearefull Instances our Sauiour makes this vse; setting downe a peremptory couclusion: <HI>Vel poenitendum, vel pereundum: Except yee repent, yee shall all likewise perish.</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="47">
Such venge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nce is no way to bee auoyded, but by repentance. But here the Iewes might flatter themselues; If wee be greater sinners then they, how comes it to passe that wee speed better then they? To this silent obie|ction, Christ makes an Apologicall answere, <HI>verse</HI> 6. You are not spared because you are more righteous, but because God to you is more gracious. You deserue such or sorer Iudgements; and the reason of this impu|nitie is not to bee looked for in your inno|cence, but in the Lordes patience: not be|cause you are not worse to him, but be|cause hee is better to you: who offers you space and grace to amend, if (at least) at last you will bring foorth the fruites of Repen|tance.</P>
<P>There be some termes in the Text; (as that the <HI>Vineyard</HI> is the Church, euery Christian a <HI>Fig-tree,</HI> God the <HI>Owner,</HI> euery Pastor a <HI>Dresser:</HI>) wherein your vnderstandings may well preuent my discour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e: these known and familiar things I take as granted of all hands.</P>
<P>It is a Parable, therefore not to bee forced euery way, nor made to warrant a conclusion which the Author neuer meant. This were, when it <HI>offers vs the company a myle, to compell it to goe with vs twaine:</HI> or to make Christes Messenger speake our errand. Such is the trade of Rome; what their owne policie hath made necessarie, they will teach God
<PB N="4" REF="48">
to make good: this is to picke darknesse out of the Su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e. No, <HI>Verificatur in sensu suo.</HI> like a good creature, it does onely that it was made for. A Parable is not like a Looking-glasse, to represent all formes and faces: but a well drawne Picture, to remonstrate that person whereof it is a counterfeit. It is like a knife, with the haft it cutts not, with the backe it cuts not, it cuts with the edge. A Candle is made to light vs, not to heate vs: a Stoue is made to heate vs, not to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ight vs: if this Parable, like the Sunne, may giue both light and heate; the more profitable, the more acceptable.</P>

How easily would man haue reiected his hopelesse brother&punc; as when a piece of clay will not worke to his minde, the Potter throwes it away: or wee cast foule ragges to the dung-hill, little thinking that they may become white paper.

That wee might see our miserable e|state, and fall to timely deprecation: that so punishing our selues, wee might saue him a labour.</P>
<P><HI>Dixit, non destinauit:</HI> as if the Lord would <MILESTONE N="2">

double and repeat his thoughts, before hee decreed it to irreuocable ruine. A diuine president of moderation!

It is too common with vs, to attempt dange|rous and desperate actions, without further counsell then our owne greene thoughts. So Anger is made a Solicitor, Passion a Iudge, and Rashnesse an Executioner. The wise man first considers, then speakes or does: the mad man first speakes or does, and then consi|ders. Which driues him on necessitie to pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y the after-game; with shame and sor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow to recouer his former estate, or giue it lost for euer.

It is a Porter at the Gate of Gods spirituall Temple, Man; that would be as sure to keepe out his enemies, as <HI>Dauid</HI> would haue bin ready to let in his friends. How ma|ny desperate precipices of sin would be pre|uented, were this Rule remembred; <HI>Consule Cultorem?</HI> For matter of estate, we are coun+selled by the Lawyer: for health of body, aduised by the Physician: we trust the Pilot to steere our course by Sea, the Suruey or to mete out our Land: but for the soule let it be

as barren as this Fig-tree, we take no counsell of the Gardiner. Doe worldlings consult the Preacher, concerning their vsurious trade before they vndertake it? Doe Gallants ad|uise with him, before they meet in <HI>Aceldama,</HI> the field of blood? O that they would admit an answere from such a friend, before they giue an answere to such an enemy.</P>

Thus doth hee credit his owne Ordinance, teaching the world how to esteeme of them whom him|selfe so singularly honors.

Now, is the Ministery of the Gospell inferi|our to that of the Lawe? Was the seruice of death more glorious then the seruice of life, and saluation? lf the Euangelicall Couenant bee better, is the Ministration worse? The Sonnes of the great thinke scorne of such an imployment: what they held an honor, these count a disparagement: In one and the same subiect meets their ambition and our scorne.

<P><MILESTONE N="5"><HI>These three yeares.</HI> Much time hath beene spent about the Interpretation of this time; how it is appliable to the Iewish Synagogue, to whom, it was immediatly referred. I find no great difference among Expositors, sauing onely in their tearmes. Some by the first yeare vnderstand the time before the Cap|tiuitie; by the second, their returne to Iury; by the last, the comming of Christ. Some by the first yeare, conceiue the Lawe giuen by <HI>Moses:</HI> By the second, the Propheticall at|testations: by the third, the grace of our Lord Iesus. Some resolue it thus; the first yeare was the time of Circumcision, from <HI>A|braham</HI> to <HI>Moses:</HI> the next, the Leuitical Law from <HI>Moses</HI> to <HI>Christ:</HI> the last is the yeare of Saluation by the <HI>Messias.</HI> Others vnder|stand the first yeare to bee of the Patriarchs, the middle yeare of the Iudges, the third of the Kings.

The Lord will roote out such bastard Plants, and replenish his Garden with fruit|full Trees.</P>
<P N="2">2 It drawes away nourishment from bet|ter <MILESTONE N="6"> Plants, that would beare vs fruits. For this Christ denounced a woe to those Iewish Clarkes, that keeping the Keies of heauen would <HI>neither enter themselues,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. 23.13.</NOTE> <HI>nor suffer o|thers.</HI> What should become of them, that wil neither do good, nor suffer good to be done, but cutting downe?

There is maintenance due to the Minister, but the barren Impropriator stands in his way, &amp; sucks it al from him: per|haps he leaues him some few drops, to cool<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his temples, but not enough to preserue life.</P>

He that feares God, would iustly ren|der the Church her dues, did he driue such trades, and dwell in such houses, as you do. But that God, who disposeth all as it plea|seth him, mend all when it pleaseth him, euen for his owne mercies sake.</P>
<P>Thus from a plaine Text I haue deriued you familiar perswasions: for I came not hi|ther to satisfie the curious head, but the ho|nest heart. Admit but two considerations more, and I haue done.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="9"> First the Lord hath shewed vs the way to be fruitful, by his owne example. He owes vs nothing: if he withold good things, we can|not
<PB N="53" REF="72">
chalenge him: if he sends vs good things, we are bound to thanke him. The last yeare, how generall was the complaint all ouer this Kingdome? The Mower could not fill his sythe, nor the binder vp of sheues his bo|some. The beasts perished for want of fodder, yea, children dyed in the street with hunger: the poore Father not being able with all his weekes labour to buy them (onely) bread. The fields were thin, and the barnes thinner: little in many places there was to gather, and the vnseasonable weather preuented the ga|thering of that little. The emptines of their bowels did iustly fill our bowels with com|passion: Famine is a sore plague. Wee then cryed vnto the Lord for fruits, and he heard vs: Loe in how plentifull a haruest hee hath answered our desires, to his owne praise, and our comfort! Yea, he concluded all with songs and triumphs, a ioyfull haruest-home; the best sheafe of our Wheat, the best grape of the Vintage, the best flower of our gar|land, the best fruit of that royall Tree, the safe returne of our gracious Prince. These be the fruits of his mercie to vs, where be the fruits of our thankefulnesse to him?</P>
<P>Secondly, the barren Fig-tree is of all most <MILESTONE N="10"> miserable, and so much the more, as it is bar|ren in the Vineyard.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezech. 15.3.</NOTE> The Vine fruitlesse, is of all trees most vselesse. It is compared to

But if barren it is good for nothing, not so much as to make a pinne to hang a hat on. Oakes and Cedars are good for building, Popplars for Pales, very bushes for hedging, doted wood for firing: but the fruitlesse Vine is good for nothing.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. 5.13.</NOTE> Salt keepes other things from putrefying, but if it selfe be putrefyed, what shall season it? A sweet Singer delights vs all; but <HI>Quis medebitur cantatori a Serpente percusso?</HI> If a Serpent hath stung him, who shall recouer his voice? If the eye be blind, what shall looke to the eye?</P>
<P><HI>Ad nihilum valet, quod non valet ad finem suum.</HI> It is good for nothing, that is not good for the end it was made. If a knife bee not good to cut, we say it is good for nothing: yet may some other vse be inuented for it. If a Plough be not good to breake the ground, we say it is good for nothing; yet it may stop a gap. If a hound be not good to hunt, we say he is good for nothing, yet may he in the night giue warning of a theefe. But if a <HI>Fig-tree,</HI> a Professor be not good for fruit, he is indeed, good for nothing. The refuse of other things haue their vses: sowre Wine will make Vi|neger, olde Rags make Paper, Lees are for Dyers, Soile is good to fat the Land, Pot|sheards and broken tiles to mend high waies, all good for somewhat: yea, they offer to sel
<PB N="55" REF="73">
the combings of haires; Ladies and Gentle|women know whether they be good for any purpose or no. But the fruitlesse vine, the sa|uourlesse Salt, the lightlesse Lampe, the Fig|lesse Figge-tree, the gracelesse Christian, is good for nothing.</P>
<P>We all haue our Stations in the Vineyard, to bring foorth fruits, but what bee those fruits? It was a smart Inuention of him, that hauing placed the Emperour, and the <HI>Pope,</HI> reconciled, in their Maiestick Thrones, he brought the States of the world before them. First comes a Counseller of State, with this Motto, <HI>I Aduise you two:</HI> then a Courtier <HI>I Flatter you three:</HI> then a Hus|bandman, <HI>I Feed you foure,</HI> then a Mer|chant, <HI>I Coussen you fiue:</HI> then a Lawyer, <HI>I Robbe you sixe</HI>: then a Souldier, <HI>I Fight for you seuen</HI>: then a Physician, <HI>I Kill you eight:</HI> Lastly a Priest, <HI>I absolue you all nine:</HI> This was his Satyre. But in the feare of God, as our Soueraigne doth gouerne vs in Truth and Peace; So let the Counseller ad|uise, the Iudge censure, the Husbandman la|bour, Merchant trafficke, the Lawyer plead, the Souldier beare armes, the Diuine preach; all bring forth the fruites of righteousnesse: that this Kingdome may flourish, and bee an exemplary encouragement to our neigh|bours: that our Children may bee blessed after vs, our Enemies conuinced, Aliens

conuerted, Satan confounded, the Gospell honoured, the Lord glorified, and our owne soules eternally saued. Which grace, the happy fruit of the Gospell; and glory, the happie fruit of Grace; God the Father grant vs all for his mercies sake, God the Sonne for his merits sake, God the Holy Ghost for his Names sake: to whom three Persons, and one most glorious God he rendred all honour and obedience, now and for euer. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, SIR HENRY CAREY, Lord HVNSDON, Viscount Rochford.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_AMong the many absurdities, which giue vs iust cause to abhorre the Religion of the present Roman Church, this seemeth to me none of the least; that they haue filled all the Temples vnder the commaund of their politike Hierarchy, with Idols: and changed the glory of the Inuisible God, into the worship of visible Images. They inuocate the Saints by them, yea they dare not serue the Lord without them. As if God had repea|led his vnchageable Law; and in stead of condem|ning all worship by an Image, would now receiue no worship without an Image. I haue obserued this one, among the other famous markes of that Synagogue; that they striue to condemne that which God hath iustified, and to iustifie what he hath condemned. For the former; He hath precisely directed our Iustifica|tion only by faith in the merits of Christ: this they vehem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntly dispute against. For the other; He hath (not without mention of his Ie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ousie) for bidden all worship that hath the least tang of Idolatry: this they eagerly maintaine. What large Volumes haue they written against the <HI>Second Commaunde|ment!</HI> as if they were not content to expunge it out
<PB REF="76">
of their Catechismes, vnlesse they did also <HI>Dogma|tice</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it to the whole world. They first set the people vpon a plaine rebellion, &amp; then make shew to fetch them off again with a neat distinction. Thus doe they pumpe their wits to legitimate that by a di|stinction, which God hath pronounced a Bastard by his definitiue sentence: as if the Papall <HI>Decrees</HI> were that law, wherby the world should bee iudged at the last day. But who will regard a house of magnificent structure, of honourable &amp; ancient memory, when the plague hath infected it; or theeues possesse it? And who, in their right senses, will ioyne themselues to that Temple, which after pretence of long standing, stately building, and of many such prerogatiues and royalties, is fou~d to be be smeared with superstitions, and profaned with innumerable Idols? Why should wee delight to dwell there, where God hath refused to dwell with vs.</P>
<P>I publish this argument as no new thing to your Lordship: but, wherein your well experienced know|ledge is able to informe mee. Onely I haue beene bold, through your thrice honoured Name, to trans|mit this small Discourse to the world: emboldened by the long proofe I haue had of your constant loue to the Truth, and the gracious Pietie of your most noble Mother, the best encouragement of my poore labours on earth. The best blessings of God bee still multiplied vpon her, your selfe, your religious La|dy, and your honorable Family: which is continu|ally implored by.</P>

But they that be alien or opposite to vs in Faith and Profession, are manifest, and we haue a
<PB N="2" REF="77">
frequent charge <HI>De non commiscendo.</HI> Now the neerer this ill match'd coniunction, the more intolerable; the same boord, ill; the same bed, worse; worst of all, the same <HI>Temple.</HI> So the Apostle begins his dehor|tation, <HI>Bee not vnequally yoked with vnbelee|uers:</HI> so he ends it, <HI>What agreement hath the Temple of God with Idoles!</HI> Diuers seeds of graine in one ground, diuers kinds of beasts in one yoke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deuter. 22.</NOTE> diuers sorts of cloth in one gar|ment, were expressely forbidden vnder the Law: and shall seuerall Religions bee al|lowed in one Church vnder the Gospell?</P>
<P>The absurdnes of such a mixture is here illustrated by many oppositions; the sound of all which is Interrogatiue, the sense Ne|gatiue. <HI>Righteousnesse</HI> and <HI>Vnrighteousnesse, Light</HI> and <HI>Darknesse, Christ</HI> and <HI>Beliall,</HI> the <HI>Beleeuer</HI> and the <HI>Infidel</HI>; these can haue no societie, communion, no concord, no con|iunction; and <HI>What agreement hath the Tem|ple of God with Idols?</HI></P>
<P>I need not by Art diuide these words, for they are diuided by nature. Now as <HI>Quae Deus coniunxit, nemo separet,</HI> Those things that God hath ioyned together, let no man put asunder: so <HI>Quae Deus separauit, nemo coniungat,</HI> Those things that God hath put asunder, let no man ioyne together. The scope of the Text, and the matter of my Discourse, is to separate <HI>Idols</HI> from the
<PB N="3" REF="77">
<HI>Temple</HI> of God; the holy <HI>Ghost</HI> hath diui|ded them to my hands: they cannot agree in his sentence, let them neuer agree in our practise; cursed is hee that goes about to compound this controuersie. The <HI>Temple</HI> is holy, <HI>Idols</HI> prophane, it is not lawfull to mixe <HI>Sacra profanis.</HI> The <HI>Temple</HI> is for God, <HI>Idols</HI> for the Deuill: God and the De|uill admit no reconciliation. Therefore as two hostile nations, after some treatie of peace, neither liking the proposed conditi|ons, breake off in a rage, <HI>In hoc vterque con|sentimus, qu&ograve;d consentire nolumus,</HI> in this we both consent, that we wil not consent at all; so be it heere agreed, that no agreement can bee made. In composing differences be|twixt man and man, betwixt family and fa|mily, betwixt kingdome and kingdome, <HI>Beati Pacifici,</HI> Blessed are the Peace-makers. But in reconciling Christ and Belial, the <HI>Temple</HI> of God and <HI>Idols, Maledicti pacifici,</HI> Cursed are the peace-makers. Heere <HI>Bella geri place at magnos habitura triumphos.</HI> God himselfe in Paradise did first put the quar|rell, his Apostle hath heere giuen the A|larme, and hee deserues a malediction that sounds a retreat.</P>
<P>But as no battell can be well fought with|out order, and martial array, so no discourse can bee made profitable without some me|thod. The <HI>Temple</HI> therefore wee will sup|pose
<PB N="4" REF="78">
to be Gods Castle, and <HI>Idolatry</HI> the In|uasion of it. This Castle is but one, Idols are many. The Champions that God hath set to defend his Castle, are especially or principally Princes and Pastors, the Magi|stracy and the Ministery; the aduersary for|ces that fight against it bee the Deuils mer|cenary Souldiers. The Munition on the one side is the Diuine Scripture, the sacred Word of God: the Engines, Ordnance, and Instruments of assault on the other side, are <HI>Idols.</HI> Traditions, and those carnall in|uentions, wherewith the corrupt heart of man seekes to batter it. This Siege is con|tinuall, this feud implacable, the difference irreconcileable. Yet at last the warre shall end, with the ruine of those enemies, in the triumph of the righteous, and to the euer|lasting glory of God?</P>
<P>Now though this warre bee euery way spirituall, it is diuers wayes considerable. There is a materiall, and there is a mysticall <HI>Temple:</HI> there are externall, and internall <HI>Idols:</HI> there bee ordinary, and extraordi|nary Souldiers. Euery Christian, as hee is a <HI>Temple</HI> of God, so not without the assault of <HI>Idols:</HI> there is a ciuill warre, a Rebellion within him, wherewith hee is continually exercised. In this militant estate of the Church none are free: onely he that giues full allowance to his owne corruptions, is
<PB N="5" REF="78">
not a Temple of God, but a Synagogue of Satan; a sinke of vncleannesse, rather then a Sanctuary of holinesse. Thus from one ge|nerall arise many particulars; and you will say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gene. 30.11.</NOTE> <HI>Behold a company</HI>; as <HI>Leah</HI> said of her sonne <HI>Gad, a Troupe commeth.</HI> Yet all these branches haue but one root: they are but like the wheeles of a Clocke, taken a little in sunder to view, then to bee put together againe. Let not their number discourage your attention. When a wealthy fouourite of the world sent his seruant to be speake lodging for him, he told the Host, Here will come to night the Lord of such a Mannor, the Land-lord of such a Town, the Keeper of such a Forrest, the Master of such an Of|fice, the Lay-parson of such a Parish, a Knight, a Iustice of Peace, a Gentleman, an Vsurer, and my Master; Alas, answeres the Host, I haue not lodging for halfe so many: Bee content, replies the seruant, for all these are but one man. So if you distrust your memories for roome to entertaine so many obseruations, yet be comforted, for all haue but this one Summe, <HI>There is no agreement betwixt the Temple of God and Idols.</HI></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Temple.</HEAD>
<P>That which was built by <HI>Salomon,</HI> was iustly called the <HI>Wonder</HI> of the world: a white and glorious Monument, set on the
<PB N="6" REF="79">
hill of <HI>Sion,</HI> inuiting passengers to see it, and amazing their eyes when they beheld it. It was of white Marble without, of Cedar and Gold within, all of the best, all beautifull, precious, durable. So magnificent was that holy Structure, that al nations haue admired it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalm. 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, 2.</NOTE> all times celebrated it. <HI>Beautifull for situa|tion, the ioy of the whole earth is Mount Sion.</HI> While the fauour of heauen was set vpon Ierusalem, the ioy of the whole earth was mount Sion. It is fit, hee that made the world a house for Man, should haue a house in this world made for himselfe: neither could it be too costly, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eeing all the materi|alls that went to it were his owne. Euery rotten Cottage is too good for Satan, no Fabricke could be too sumptuous for God. While his people dwelt in Tents, Himselfe was content to dwell in a Tabernacle: in the flitting condition of Israel, hee would haue his owne house a moueable, that they might neuer remoue without him. But when their residence was setled in the pro|mised Land, he would haue his Tabernacle turned into a Temple; that they dwelling where he appoynted them, Hee might also dwell among them. The former was for motion, the latter for rest: the one for pro|gresse, the other his standing house. All this while God had but one House at once: first the Tabernacle, then that gaue place to
<PB N="7" REF="79">
the Temple, and <HI>Salomons</HI> Temple being defaced, was supplied by <HI>Zorobabels.</HI> Now he hath many houses, euen so many as there bee nations, as there bee congregations, as there bee persons professing Christ. Wee haue houses of our owne, why should not God haue his? A Prince hath more hou|ses then one, why should the King of Hea|uen be abridg'd? A King in his owne per|son can dwell but in one house at once; let God haue neuer so many, hee can at once fill them all. Hee hath a house of flesh, so euery Beleeuer is his Temple: a house of stone, so this materiall one is his Temple: a house neither of flesh nor stone, but imma|teriall, immortall in the heauens. And as Christ sayes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn 14.</NOTE> that <HI>in his Fathers House there are many Mansions</HI>; so in his Fathers militant Church there are many houses.</P>
<P>It were vaine to aske what God should doe with a house, when wee consider what we do with our owne: what, but dwell in it? But how God doth dwell in it, seemes to be a question: seeing the Apostle saith, that <HI>hee dwells not in Temples made with hands:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Actes 17.24.</NOTE> Indeed he dwels not in them, as wee dwell in ours. Our house defends vs, God defends his house: our house comprehends vs, God comprehends his house. Wee are onely within our houses, and they are without vs: God is so within his house, that hee is also
<PB N="8" REF="80">
without it, elsewhere, euery where, yea his house is within him. When we are abroad, we cannot keepe our houses; yea when wee are in them asleepe, they serue to keepe vs. God can neuer be absent from his, nor doth the keeper of this <HI>Temple</HI> euer sleepe. Now euery materiall Temple, wherein the Saints are assembled, the truth of the Gospell is preached and professed, the Holy Sacra|ments duely administred, and the Lords Name is inuocated and worshipped, is the <HI>Temple of God.</HI></P>
<P>Why is it called <HI>His</HI> Temple, but for the testification of his presence? When <HI>Cain</HI> stood excommunicated for murdering his brother, and might not come to the place appointed for Gods seruice, he is said to be <HI>cast out from the presence of the Lord.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Genes. 4.16.</NOTE> Some haue interpreted the like of <HI>Ionahs flying from his presence</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ionah 1.3.</NOTE> that he fled from the place where the Prophets vsed to stand ready to be sent of God.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leuit. 10.2.</NOTE> <HI>Nadab and Abihu dyed be|fore the Lord</HI>; that is, before the Altar of the Arke or Altar, in the Tabernacle or Tem|ple, was said to be done <HI>coram D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mino.</HI> And yet too many come to the Temple with so little reuerence, as if they thought God were not at home, or did not dwell in his owne house. But the Lord is present in his Temple: in vaine shall wee hope to finde
<PB N="9" REF="80">
him elsewhere, if we do not seek him here <HI>I will bee in the midst of you,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Math 18.20.</NOTE> <HI>gathered together in my Name:</HI> not any where, not euery where, but here. Indeed, no place excludes him, but this place is sure of him: hee fills all places with his presence, hee fills this with his gracious presence. Heere hee both heares vs, and is heard of vs:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bern.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Audit orantes, docet audientes</HI>; hee heares our pray|ers, and teacheth vs our lessons. No place sends vp faithfull prayers in vaine, no place hath such a promise of hearing as the Tem|ple. It is the Lords Court of Audience, his Highnesse Court of Requests. There humble soules open their grieuances, from thence they returne loaden with graces. Why are many so voyd of goodnesse, but because they are negligent of the publike deuotions? They seek not the Lord where hee may bee found, therefore deserue to misse him where they pretend to seek him. Why should they thinke to finde God in their Closets, while they care not to seeke him in his Temples? When wee need the helpe of our friend, do we tarry till we meet him by chance, or till hee come to vs, or shall wee not rather go home to his house? <HI>Peter and Iohn went vp into the Temple at the houre of Prayer:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Actes 3.1.</NOTE> they thought it no suffi|cient to pray in their priuate chambers, but ioyne themselues with the Congregation,

Beside these, the Temple of God hath two kinds of foes.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Anabaptists tell vs; that the old su|perstition hath made those houses fitter for Stables then for Churches; that they ought no more to be called <HI>Templa Dei,</HI> but <HI>Tem|pla Idolorum</HI>; as they pretend, the Passeouer was called in those corrupt times,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn 2.13.</NOTE> not <HI>Pas|cha Dei,</HI> but <HI>Pascha Iudaeorum.</HI> By the same reason they would haue remoued all Prin|ces, because some haue abused their go|uernments. But we say, though euill men abuse good things yet if a kingdome were not a lawfull State, <HI>Dauid</HI> and <HI>Iosias</HI> would neuer haue been Kings; for good men doe not vse euill things. The Temple in Christs time was become a denne of theeues, yet euen then and there did hee send vp deuout and holy Prayers. It is a grosse ignorance that cannot distinguish betwixt a fault that proceeds <HI>ex natura facti,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Th.</HI> 1. <HI>qu.</HI> 41. <HI>art.</HI> 6.</NOTE> and that

<P N="2">2. The <HI>Sacrilegious,</HI> to whom God is be|holding, if they let his Temple stand; but for the maintenance of it, they will bee so bold with him, as either to share halfe, or leaue him none. There bee many that pray in the Temple, who yet also prey on the Temple: as if a thiefe should doe homage to that house in the day, which hee meanes to robbe in the night.

aboue, the glorious kingdome of Iesus Christ.</P>
<P>These bee the enemies to the Temple, whereof the first would separate <HI>Dominum &agrave; Templo,</HI> the other <HI>templum &agrave; Domino:</HI> they would take God from the Temple, these would take the Temple from God. Let mee conclude this poynt with two watch-words.</P>
<P N="1">1. The first concernes vs of the Ministe|ry, the wayters of the Temple. It hath been an old saying, <HI>De Templo omne bonum, de Templo omne malum:</HI> all good or euill comes from the Temple.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chrys.</HI></NOTE> Where the Pastor is good, and the people good, hee may say to them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 9.1.</NOTE> as <HI>Paul</HI> to his <HI>Corinthians, Nonne opus meum vos estis in Domino, Are not ye my work in the Lord?</HI> Where the Pastor is bad, and the people no better, they may say to him, <MILESTONE N="10"><HI>Nonne destructis nostra tu es in seculo,</HI> art not thou our destruction in the world? It is no wonder, if an abused Temple make a disor|dered people. A wicked Priest is the worst creature vpon Gods earth: no sinne is so blacke, as that shall appeare from vnder a white Surplesse. Euery mans iniquitie is so much the hainouser, as his place is holyer. The sinne of the Clergy is like a Rheume, which rising from the stomach into the head, drops downe vpon the lungs, fretting the most noble and vitall parts, till all the
<PB N="16" REF="84">
members languish into corruption. The lewd sonnes of <HI>Eli</HI> were so much the lesse tolerable, by sinning in the Tabernacle. Their sacrifices might doe away the sinnes of others; no sacrifice could doe away their owne. Many a soule was the cleaner for the blood of those beasts they shed; their owne soules were the fouler by it. By one and the same seruice, they did expiate the peoples offences, and multiply their owne. Our Clergie is no Charter for heauen. Such men are like the conueyances of Land, Eui|dences and Instruments to settle others in the kingdome of heauen, while themselues haue no part of that they conuey. It is no vnpossible thing, for men at once to shew the way to Heauen with their tongue, and lead the way to Hell with their foot. It was not a Iewish Ephod, it is not a Romish Cowle, that can priuiledge an euill doer from punishment. Therefore it was Gods charge to the executioners of his Iudge|ments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezek. 9.6. 1 Pet. 4.17. Iohn 2.15.</NOTE> <HI>Begin at my owne Sanctuary:</HI> and the Apostle tells vs, that <HI>Iudgement shall begin at the house of God:</HI> and Christ entring into his Propheticall Office, began reformation at his Fathers house. Let our deuout and holy behauiour preuent this; and by our reuerent carriage in the Temple of God, let vs ho|nour the God of the Temple. It should be our endeuour <HI>to raise vp seed vnto our elder
<PB N="17" REF="84">
Brother,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Aug.</HI></NOTE> to winne soules vnto Christ. <HI>Nun|quam cessate lucrari Christo, qui lucrati estis &agrave; Christo.</HI> If Christ, while hee was vpon the Crosse, saith <HI>Bernard,</HI> had giuen mee some drops of his owne blood in a Violl, how carefully would I haue kept them, how dearely esteemed them, how laid them next my heart? But now he did not thinke it fit to trust me with those drops, But hee hath intrusted to me a flocke of his lambes, those soules for whom hee shed his blood, like whom his owne blood was not so deare vn|to him: vpon these let mee spend my care, my loue, my labour, that I may present them holy Saints to my deare Lord Iesus.</P>
<P N="2">2. The other concernes all Christians; that they beware, lest for the abuses of men, they despise the Temple of God. For as the Altar cannot sanctifie the Priest, so nor can the vnholinesse of the Priest dishallow the Altar. His sin is his owne, and cannot make you guiltie: the vertue and comfort is from God, and this is still able to make you holy. When wee read,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 2.17.</NOTE> that <HI>the sinne of the Priests was great before the Lord, for men abhorred the offering of the Lord</HI>: this we all confesse, was ill done of the Priests; and I hope no man thinks, it was well done of the people. Say their sinnes, yea their very persons were worthy to be abhorred, shall men therefore scorne the Sanctuary, &amp; cast that contempt
<PB N="18" REF="85">
on the Seruice of God, which belongs to the vices of man? This were to adde our owne euill to the euill of others, and to of|fend God because he was offended. Cannot the faults of men displease vs, but wee must needs fall out with God? Doe we not pro|uoke him iustly to abhorre our soules, when we so vniustly contemne his seruice? Know, that he is able to sanctifie thy heart, euen by the ministery of that man whose heart hee hath not yet sanctified. The vertue consists not in the humane action, but in the diuine Institution. Wee say of the Sacraments themselues, much more of the Ministers; <HI>Isti non tribuunt, quod per istos tribuitur:</HI> these doe not giue vs, what God doth giue vs by them.</P>
<P>But this age is ficke of such a wanton le|vitie, that wee make choyce of the Temple, according to our fancy of the Preacher: and so tye vp the free Spirit of God from blowing where he pleaseth, that he shall be beholding to the grace of the Speaker, for giuing grace to the hearer. So whereas <HI>Paul</HI> ties Faith to hearing, they will tie hearing to Faith; and as they beleeue the holinesse of the man, so they expect fruit of the Sermon. This is to make <HI>Paul</HI> something, and <HI>Apollos</HI> something; wheras <HI>Paul</HI> himselfe sayes they are <HI>both nothing.</HI> God onely giues the en|crease, and who shall appoint him by whom
<PB N="19" REF="85">
he shall giue it? Let the feed bee good, and the ground good, and the Lord will send fruit whosoeuer bee the Sower. But while you make hearing a matter of sport, Prea|ching is too often become an exercise of wit. Words are but the Images of matter, and (you shall heare anon) it is not lawfull to worship Images. It dangerously mis becomes the Temple, when any thing shall bee intended there, but the glory of God, and gaining of soules to Iesus Christ.</P>
<P>Thus much concerning <HI>the Temple</HI>; the next poynt I must fall vpon is</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Idols.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Idol</HI> in Greeke signifies a resemblance or representation, and differs not from <HI>Image</HI> in Latine: both at first taken in a good sense: but the corruption of times hath bred a cor|ruption of words; and <HI>Idol</HI> is now only ta|ken for the Image of a false god. Euery <HI>Idol</HI> is an Image, but euery Image is not an Idol: but euery Image made and vsed for religi|ous purposes, is an Idol. The Images of God are Idols; wherwith Popery abounds. An old man, sitting in a chaire, with a triple Crowne on his head, and Pontificall robes on his backe, a Doue hanging at his beard, and a Crucifixe in his armes; is their Image of the Trinitie. This Picture sometime serues them for a god in their Churches,
<PB N="20" REF="86">
and somtime for a signe at th ir tap-houses: so that it is a common saying in many of their Cities, Such a Gentleman lyes at the Trinity, and his seruants at Gods head. This they seeme to doe, as if they would in some sort requite their Maker: because God made man according to his Image, therfore they, by way of recompence, will make God ac|cording to mans Image. But this certainly they durst not doe, without putting the second Commandement out of their Ca|techismes, and the whole Decalogue out of their Consciences.</P>
<P>I intend no polemicall discourse of this poynt, by examining their Arguments: that businesse is fitter for the Schoole, then the Pulpit. And, O God, that either Schoole or Pulpit in Christendome should be troubled about it! that any man should dare to make that a question, which the Lord hath so plainely and punctually forbidden! Beside the Iniquity, how grieuous is the absurdity? How is a body without a spirit, like to a spi|rit without a body? A visible picture, like an inuisible nature? How would the King take it in scorne, to haue his picture made like a Wesell or a Hedgehog? And yet the difference betwixt the greatest Monarch, and the least Emmet, is nothing to the di|stance betwixt a finite &amp; an infinite. If they alledge with the Anthropomorphites, that
<PB N="21" REF="86">
the Scripture attributes to God hands, and feet, and eyes: why therefore may they not represent him in the same formes? But we say, the Scripture also speaks of his couering vs with the Shadow of his wings; why ther|fore do they not paint him like a Bird with feathers? If they say, that he appeared to <HI>Daniel</HI> in this forme, because hee is there called the <HI>Ancient of dayes:</HI> wee answere, that Gods Commandements, and not his apparitions, be rules to vs: by the former we shall be iudged and not by the latter. It is mad Religion, to neglect what he bids vs doe, and to imitate what he hath done: as if we should despise his Lawes, and goe about to counterfeit his thunder. God is too infi|nite for the comprehension of our soules, why should we then labour to bring him in|to the narrow compasse of bords &amp; stones? Certenly, that should not be <HI>Imaged,</HI> which cannot be <HI>Imagined.</HI> But Christ was a man, why may not his Image be made? Some answer, that no man can make an Image of Christ, without leauing out the chiefe part of him, which is his Diuinitie. It was the Godhead vnited to the manhood, that makes him Christ: sure this cannot be pain|ted. But why should wee make Christs I|mage without Christs warrant? The Lord hath forbidden the making of any Image, whether of things in heauen, where Christ
<PB N="22" REF="87">
is; or of things on earth, where Christ was; to worship them. Now till God reuoke that precept, what can authorise this practice?</P>
<P>Their Images of the Saints, employed to such religious purposes, make them no lesse then <HI>Idolaters.</HI> It is a silly shift to say, the honor done to the Images, reflects vpon the represented Saints. When they cloath an Image, is the Saint ere the gayer or warmer? when they offer to an Image, is the Saint ere the richer? When they kneele to an Image. the Saint esteemes himselfe no more wor|shipped, then the King holds himselfe ho|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oured, when a man speaks to his picture be fore his face. Therefore some of them ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> driuen to confesse plainly, that the Image is worshipped for it selfe. But could the Saints in heauen be heard speak vpon earth, they would disclaime that honour, which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">reiudiciall to their Maker. As <HI>Caluin</HI> is not afraid to say of the blessed Virgin, that shee would hold it lesse despite done to her, if they should pull her by the haire of the head, or trample her in the dirt, then to set <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er in riuality with her Sonne and God and Sauiour. But they tell vs, that they worship not the Images of false Gods, as did the Pagans; but onely the Images of Gods <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wne seruants, and choise friends. But will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he iealous God endure this, that his hono<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e taken from him, vpon condition it be no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="23" REF="87">
bestowed vpon his enemies, but on his friends? <HI>Idolatry</HI> is called <HI>Adultery</HI> in the Scriptures: and shall a woman quit her selfe from offence, because though she doe com|mit adultery, yet it is with none but her hus|bands friends? Is this done in a good mea|ning, or in loue to Christ? It is but a bad excuse of a wife, to say that shee exceeding|ly loues her husband, therefore must haue some other man to kisse and embrace in his absence, and all this in loue to her husband.</P>
<P>Wee are all by nature prone to <HI>Idolatrie:</HI> when we were little children, we loued ba|bies: and being growne men, we are apt to loue Images. And as Babies be childrens I|dols. so Idols &amp; Images be mens Babies. It seemes that Idols are fittest for Babes, there|fore so the Apostle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">its his caution,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 John. 5.21.</NOTE> <HI>Babes keepe your selues from Idols.</HI> As all our know|ledge comes by sense, so we naturally desire a sensible obiect of deuotion: finding it ea|sier to see Pictures, then to comprehend Doctrines, and to forme prayers to the Ima|ges of men, then to forme man to the I|mage of God.</P>
<P>Nor can they excuse themselues from I|dolatry, by saying they put their confidence in God, not in the Images of God. For when the Israelites had made their golden Calfe, and danced about, one calfe about another; they were not such beasts, as to
<PB N="24" REF="88">
thinke that beast their God. But so can Su|perstition besot the mind, that it makes vs not men, before it can wake vs Idolaters. What doe they say?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 32.1.</NOTE> <HI>Make vs gods that shall go before us.</HI> Euery word is wicked, ab|surd, sensles. 1. They had seene the power of God in many miraculous deliuerances be|fore their eyes; the voice of God had scarce yet done thundering in their eares: he had said, <HI>I am Iehouah, thou shalt haue no other gods</HI>; and this they trembling heard him speake out of the midst of the flames: and yet they dare speake of <HI>another god.</HI> 2. The singular number would not serue them, make vs <HI>gods.</HI> How many gods would they haue? Is there any more then one? 3. <HI>Make</HI> vs gods; and were not they strange gods that could bee <HI>made?</HI> In stead of acknow|ledging God their <HI>Maker,</HI> they command the <HI>making</HI> of gods. 4. This charge they put vpon <HI>Aaron,</HI> as if he were able to make a god? <HI>Aaron</HI> might helpe to spoyle a man, either himselfe or them, but hee could not make a man, not one haire of a man, much lesse a god: and yet they say to him, <HI>Make vs gods.</HI> 5. And what should these gods doe? <HI>Goe before vs?</HI> Alas, how should they goe, that were not able to stand? how goe before others, that could not moue themselues? Oh the blockishnes of men, that make blocks to worship! Otherwise, how
<PB N="25" REF="88">
could they that are the Images of God, fall downe before the Images of creatures.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wisd. 13.18.</NOTE> <HI>For health, they call vpon that which is weake: for life, they pray to that which is dead: and a pro|sperous iourney they beg of that which cannot set a foot forward.</HI></P>
<P>Yet as their sinne was bad enough, let not our vncharitablenesse make it worse. Let vs not thinke them so vnreasonable, as to thinke that Calfe a God; or that the Idoll which they made to day, did bring them out of Egipt three moneths before. It was the true God they meant to worship in the Calfe, and yet (at the best) euen that Idolatry was damnable. So charitie bids vs hope of the Papists, that they doe not take that bord or stone for their God, yet withall wee find that God doth take them for Idolaters. They tell vs (with a new distinction ) that they forbid the people, to giue Diuine wor|ship to Images: but we say, they had better forbid the people to haue Images. A blocke lies in the high way, and a watchman is set by it to warne the Passengers; Take heed, heere is a blocke. But how if the watchman fall a sleepe? Whether is the safer course, quite to remoue the blocke out of the way, or to trust the passengers safetie vpon the watchmans vigilancie? As for their watch|men, commonly they are as very Images as the Images themselues: and how should
<PB N="26" REF="89">
one blocke remoue another? When <HI>Iero|boam</HI> had set vp his two Idols in Israel, hee I rakes vp his Priests out of the common kennell; the basest of the people were good enough for such a bastard deuotion: wood|den priests were fit enough to wayt vpon golden Deities. So when <HI>Micah</HI> had made him a costly Idol, he hires him a beggerly Leuite. No ortherwise did the Painter ex|cuse himselfe, for drawing the Images of <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> too ruddy and high coloured in the face; that howsoeuer they were while they liued, pale with fasting and preaching, yet now they must needs become red with blushing at the errors and ignorance of their successors; for such with a lowd noyse they giue themselues out to be.</P>
<P>To conclude, if it were as easie to con|uince Idolaters, as it is to confound &amp; tread downe their <HI>Idols,</HI> this labour of Confuta|tion had bin well spared, or were soone en|ded. But if nothing can reclaime them from this superstitious practice, let them reade th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ir fearefull sentence.

<PB N="27" REF="89">
and sanctifie their hearts to yeeld, that <HI>there is no agreement betwixt the Temple of God and Idols:</HI> which is the next point, whereof I shall speake with what breuitie I can, and with what fidelitie I ought.</P>

<HEAD>No agreement.</HEAD>
<P>There bee some points which the wrang|ling passions of men haue left further asun|der, then they found them; about which there needed not haue bin such a noyse. But things that are in their owne natures contra|ry, and opposed by the ordinance of God, can neuer be reconciled. An enemy may be made a friend, but enmity can neuer bee made friendship. The ayre that is now light, may become darke: but light can neuer be|come darknesse. Contraries in the abstract are out of all composition.

In the morning they come to thanke <HI>Dagon</HI> for the victory, and to fall downe before him, before whom they thought the God of Israel was fallen: and loe, now they find the keeper flat on his face before the prisoner. Had they formerly of their own accord, with awfull reuerence, laid him in this posture of an humble pro|stration; yet God would not haue brooked the indignity of such an entertainment. But seeing they durst set vp their Idol cheeke by cheeke with their Maker, let them goe read their folly in the Temple floore, &amp; confesse that hee which did cast their god so low, could cast them lower. Such a shame doth the Lord owe all them, which wil be making matches betwixt him and <HI>Belial.</HI> Yet they consider not, how should this God raise vs,

who is not able to stand, or rise himselfe? Strange they must confesse it, that whereas <HI>Dagon</HI> was wont to stand, and themselues to fall down, now <HI>Dagon</HI> was fallen down, and themselues stood; &amp; must help vp with their owne god. Yea, their god seemes to worship them on his face, and to craue that succour from them, which he was neuer able to giue them. Yet in his place they set him againe; and now lift vp those hands to him, which helped to lift him vp; and prostrate those fa|ces to him, before whom he lay prostrate. So can Idolatry turne men into the stockes and stones which they worship? <HI>They that make them, are like vnto them.</HI> But will the Lord put it vp thus? No, the next fall shall burst it to pieces; that they may sensibly per|ceiue, how God scornes a Competitor, and that there is <HI>no agreement</HI> betwixt <HI>Him</HI> and <HI>Idols.</HI> Now what is the difference betwixt the Philistims and Papists? The Philistims would set God in the Temple of <HI>Idols,</HI> the Papists would set <HI>Idols</HI> in the Temple of God.

<HI>Israel</HI> cals for gods; but why should this god of theirs be fashioned like a <HI>Calfe?</HI> What may bee the reason of this shape? Whence had they the originall of such an Idol? Most likely in Egypt: they had seen a blacke Calfe with white spots worshipped there. This Image stil ran in their minds, and stole their hearts, &amp; now they long to haue it set vp before their eyes. Egypt wil not out of their fancies: when they wanted meat, they thought of the Egyptian flesh-pots: now they want <HI>Moses,</HI> they thinke of the E|gyptian Idols. They brought gold out of E|gypt; that very gold was contagious; the ve|ry Eare-rings and Iewels of Egypt are fit to make Idols. The Egyptian burdens made them run to the true God, the Egyptian ex|amples led them to a false god. What meane our wanderers by running to Rome &amp; such superstitious places; vnlesse they were weary of the Church of God, &amp; would fetch home Idols? If it were granted, that there is some little truth among them, yet who is so sim|ple, as to seeke his corne among a great heap of chaffe, and that far off; who may haue it at home, winnowed and clensed to his hand?</P>

<P>Consider it well, ye that make no scruple of superstitious assemblies; it will bee hard for you to dwell in a Temple of Idols vn|tainted.

<P>Thus farre we haue taken a literall suruey of the Text; concerning the materiall Tem|ple, externall or obiectuall Idols, and the impossibilitie of their agreement. Now to come neerer home to our selues in a morall Exposition: here first</P>
</DIV2>

<PB N="38" REF="95">
<HEAD>The Temple of God</HEAD>
<P>Is the <HI>Church</HI> of Christ, and they are so like, that we often interchange the tearmes, calling a Temple the Church, &amp; the Church a Temple of God. The materiall Temple vnder the Law was a figure of the spirituall vnder the Gospell. The former was distin|guished into three roomes; the Porch, the holy place, and the <HI>Sanctum Sanctorum,</HI> or Holy of holies. The Porch prefigured Bap|tisme, which is the doore whereby we enter into the Church of Christ. The Holy place, the communion of the militant church vp|ly earth, separated from the world. The Ho|on of holies, whereinto the high Priest only entred, &amp; that once a yeare, presignified the glorious kingdome of heauen, wherinto the Lord <HI>Iesus</HI> entred once for all. There was one Court of the Temple common, whither accesse was denied to none: though they were vn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">leane or vncircumcised, thus farre they might be admitted. There was another Court within that, allowed to none but the Israelites, &amp; of them to none but the cleane. There was a third, proper only to the Priests and Leuites, whither the Laitie might not come: thus farre they might bring their of|ferings, but further they might not offer to goe. In the Temple it selfe there was one roome, into which the Leuites might not
<PB N="39" REF="95">
enter, the Priests might. Another, whither the Priests might not come; but onely the high Priest, and euen hee but once yearely. Some passages of the Christian Church are common to all, euen to the vncleane hypo|crites, and foule-hearted sinners. They haue accesse to Gods holy ordinances, and tread in his Courts; as the Pharisee came into the congregation, and <HI>Iudas</HI> receiued the Com|munion. Other are secret and reserued, wherein the faithfull onely conuerse with God, and solace themselues in the sweet fruition of his gracious presence.</P>
<P>The materiall Temple in three diuisions, seemed to be a cleare representation of the Church in three degrees. The first signified the externall and visible face of the Church, from which no professor of Christ is debar|red. The second, the communion of the in|uisible Church vpon earth. The last, the highest heauen of Gods glorified Saints. Neither did those roomes more exceed one another then do these parts of the spirituall house of Christ. What are the most polished corners of the Temple, to the spirituall &amp; li|uing stones of the Church? What be pebles to Saphirs, or marbles to Diamonds? How|soeuer some are more transported with in|sensible monuments, then with liuing Saints. As it was a complaint long since, <HI>Fulget Ec|clesia in parietibus, luget in pauperibus.</HI> Yet
<PB N="40" REF="96">
Temples are built for men, not men for Temples: and what is a glorious edifice, when the whole world is not worth one soule? Dead walls bee of small value, to the liuing Temples of the holy Ghost: yea, the temple of our body, to the temple of Christs Body, his Church: yea the Temple of Gods Church militant on earth, to that which is triumphant in heauen. What is siluer and gold, Cedar and Marble, to those diuine gra|ces, faith, truth, pietie, holinesse? <HI>Salomons</HI> Temple did last but some 430. yeares, the Church is for eternitie. The Temple took vp but a little space of ground, at most the Hill Sion, the Church is vniuersally spread: in all parts of the world God hath his chosen.</P>
<P>Did our intellectuall eyes truely behold the beauty of this Temple, wee would with that good Emperor, esteeme it better to be a member of the Church, then head of the kingdome. We would set this one thing a|gainst all worldly glories. As when <HI>Henry</HI> 4. that late <HI>Great</HI> king of France, was told of the king of Spaines ample dominions: as first he is king of <HI>Castile,</HI> and I (quoth <HI>Henry</HI>) am king of France: he is king of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> and I am king of France: he is king of <HI>Portugall,</HI> and I am king of France: he is king of <HI>Na|ples,</HI> and I am king of France: he is king of the <HI>Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ilies,</HI> and I am king of France: hee is king of <HI>Noua Hispania</HI>&punc; the West Indies, and I
<PB N="41" REF="96">
am king of France; he thought the kingdome of France equiualent to all these. So let thy soule, O Christian, solace it selfe against all the wants of thy mortall pilgrimage, in this, that thou art a member of the church. Another hath more wit or learning, yet I am a Christian: an|other hath more honour and preferment on earth, yet I am a Christian: another hath more siluer and gold and riches, yet I am a Christian: another hath large possessions, yet I haue an In|heritance in heauen, I am a Christian. <HI>Dauid</HI> thought it not so happy to bee a King in his owne house, as to bee a doore-keeper in Gods house. Were our hearts throughly sanctified, we would vnder-value all honours to this, that we are parts of this spirituall Temple, the mem|bers of Iesus Christ.</P>

Sure, wee reade no such matter. To distribute among the Saints departed seuerall Offices; as one to haue the charge of women in child-bed, another to bee the Patron of such a Citie or Countrey; (to o|mit their protection of beasts, one for hogs, an|other for horses) seemes to honour God in thus honouring them: but it is a lye, and a plaine derogation to his vniuersall prouidence: yea as absurd, as if the flies should take vpon them to giue the charges and offices of this kingdome. To say, the Saints in heauen know the occur|rents of this nether world, and the condition of their ancient friends or children below, reading them in the Deitie, as by the reflection of a glasse; this is a fiction that carries a shew of ho|nouring God: but it doth indeed dishonor him, by making creatures as omniscient as their Ma|ker. Besides, how absurd is it to say, that <HI>Iohn</HI> in <HI>Patmos</HI> seeing Christ, did see all that Christ saw. If I standing on the ground, see a man on the top of a high Turret, doe I see all that hee seeth. If the sight of him that looketh, bee to be measured by the sight of him on whom hee looketh; it will follow that hee which looketh on a blinde man, should see no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hing at all. And who seeth not the blindness of this conseque~ce?</P>
<P>To say that all the worship done to the Virgin
<PB N="43" REF="97">
mother, redounds to the honour of her Sonne and God, is a grosse falshood.

Did this make for the honour of Christ, when the red blood of our Sauiour is not so able to bring men to heauen, as the white milke of his mother? which must needs be the morall or meaning of it.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Barrhad in Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Euang.</HI></NOTE> Or the obseruation of <HI>Barrhadius</HI> the Iesuite, who made bold to aske Christ, why in his ascension to heauen he did not take his mother along with him; and makes himselfe this answer: It may be, Lord, for feare lest thy heauenly Court should bee in doubt, which of the two they should goe first to meet, <HI>An tibi Domino suo, an ipsi Dominae suae,</HI> whether thee their Lord, or her their Lady: as if it had been well aduised of Christ to leaue his mother behind him, lest she should share part of his glo|ry. Did this make for the honour of Christ? To choke vp the knowledge of God, by preaching that Ignorance is the mother of Deuotion, hath
<PB N="44" REF="98">
small colour of honouring God. The ascribing of false miracles to the liuing or departed Saints, seemes to honour God, but sure he will neuer thanke them for it. Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> being sick, a blind man came to him, expecting that he could miracu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ously restore his sight: but that good Father sent him away with a check, <HI>Doest thou think that if I could cure thee by miracle, that I would not by miracle cure my selfe?</HI></P>
<P>It is a foolish thought, that God will bee glorified by a lie. Our iudiciall Astrologers, that tye mens destinies to the Starres and Pla|nets, pretend Gods honour, who hath giuen such vertue and influence to his creatures; but indeed make the~ no better then Idols. Though the Sunne and Moone bee good and necessary, yet to adore the Sunne and Moone is flat Idola|try. It was not <HI>Mercury</HI> that made the theefe, nor <HI>Venus</HI> that made the strumpet: as when the husband cudgeld his adulterous wife, and shee complained that he was vnnaturall to strike his owne flesh; alledging that it was not <HI>shee</HI> that playd the harlot, but <HI>Venus</HI> in her: to whom he replied, that neither was it <HI>shee</HI> that he did beat, but <HI>Venus</HI> in her, or rather <HI>Venus</HI> out of her.</P>
<P>To make this vsefull to ourselues; let vs take heed of fancying an other seruice of God, then hee hath prescribed vs. Euery Master in his owne family, appoints the manner how he will be serued. He that requires our seruice, requires it his owne way; or else he holds vs to serue our

selues, not him. Shall we make ourselues wiser then our Maker, as if he did not best know what would best please him? Shall heauen giue a blessing to that, which was deuised against the will of heauen? Doth not God threaten them with the addition of plagues, that shall adde to his precepts? If such deuices be good and ne|cessary, why did not God command them? Did he want wisdome? If they bee not neces|sary, why doe wee vse them? Is it not our pre|sumptuous folly? The Lords Ielousie is stirred vp by the rivalitie, not onely of a false God, but of a false worship. Nothing is more dangerous, then to mint his seruices in our owne braines. <HI>In vaine doe they worship mee,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 15.9.</NOTE> <HI>teaching for doctrines, the commandements of men.</HI> Is it not gricuous for men to lose all their labour, and that in the maine busines of their life?

Like a dog that hunts counter, and takes great paines to no pur|pose.</P>
<P>Euill deeds may haue sometimes good mea|nings; but those good meanings are answered with euill recompences.

<P>Thus wee haue looked abroad, but now haue we no Idols at home? O how happy was it, if they were as farre from the Temple, as they are, from agreement with the Temple?

O that a man should take pleasure in that which makes him no man: that he should let a thiefe in at his mouth, to steale away his wit: that for a little throat-indulgence, he should kil in himselfe not onely the first <HI>Adam,</HI> his reason; but euen the se|cond <HI>Adam</HI> his regeneration; &amp; so commit two murders at once! In euery Brothell this Idol hath her temple; where the bed of vncleannes, is the Altar, the Priest a strumpet, and the sacri|fice, a burning flesh offred to <HI>Moloch.</HI> It is no rare thing for a man to make an Idol of his Mistres, and to spend more time in her courtings, then he doth at his prayers&punc; more cost on her body, the~ vpon his own soule.

Invaine doth that man pursue honor, his shadow, while he turnes his face from vertue and goodnes; he shall misse what hee so labors to catch: but let him set his face toward Christ, the Sun of righ|teousnes, and run to the high prize of eternitie, this shadow shall wayt vpon him; for <HI>those that honour me, I will honour,</HI> saith the Lord.</P>
<P><HI>God resisteth the proud</HI>; and good reason, for the proud resisteth God. Other sins diuert a man from God, only Pride brings him against God, &amp; brings God against him.

Thus the Romists presume to do more good works, and those more perfect then God requires: so that he is become a debter to them, &amp; bound to make them satisfaction.

<P>lt is the Deuils especiall ayme, to bring these Idols neere the Temple: he finds no such plea|sure to dominere in his owne hell; but he hath a mind to Paradise.

Will the Lord dwell in a drunken body? Must we not cease to be his Temples, when we become <HI>Bacchus</HI> his Tuns and tunnels? There is <HI>Manna,</HI> the bread of life within vs; will not Epi|curisme &amp; throat-indulgence corrupt it? There is peace in vs, will not pride and contention af|fright it? There is the loue of heauen in vs, wil not the loue of the world banish it? Shall the graces of God cohabitate with the vices of Sa|tan? Wil the Temple of God indure Idols? No&punc; these Eagles plumes wil not brook the blending with co~mon fethers: this heauenly gold scornes the mixture of base and sophisticate metalls.</P>
<P>Let vs search our hearts &amp; ransake them nar|rowly: if we doe not cast out these Idols, God

will not own vs for his Temples.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">1.13</NOTE> <HI>My House shall bee called the house of prayer:</HI> this was Gods <HI>Ap|propriation: But you haue made it a den of theeues:</HI> this is mans <HI>Impropriation.</HI> Let vs take heed of impropriating Gods house; remembring how he hath reue~ged such a profanation with scourges. <HI>Wee are bought with a price,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 6.20</NOTE> <HI>therefore let vs glo|rifie God both in body &amp; spirit, for they are his:</HI> His purchase, his Temple, his inheritance, his habi|tation: do not lose so gracious an owner, by the most vngracious sacriledge. You see many rui|ned houses, which haue bin once kings palaces: learne by those dead spectacles to keepe your selues fro~ the like fortunes: left God say of you, <HI>Hoc Templum meum fuit,</HI> this was my house; but now because it took in Idols, I haue forsaken it.</P>
<P>Or what if wee doe not set vp Idols in these Temples, when we make the Temples themselus Idols? or say not with <HI>Israel, Make vs gods,</HI> while we make gods of our selues? while we dresse al|tars, and erect shrines to our own braines, &amp; kisse our own hands for the good they haue done vs?

Shal we refuse to adore the Saints &amp; Angels, and yet giue diuine worship to our selues, dust and ashes? If victory crowne our battels, if plenty fill our garners, or successe answere our endeuours; must the glory of all re|flect vpon our own atchieuements? This is a ri|vality that God will not endure, to make so ma|ny Temples nothing but Idols. But as the Lan|cashire
<PB N="64" REF="108">
Iustice said of the ill-shap'd Rood, thogh it be not well fauoured enough for a god, it will serue to make an excellent deuill. So proud dust and ashes, that arrogates the honor of God, and impropriates it to himselfe; though he be too foule for a Temple, yet he is fit enough for an Idol. When <HI>David</HI> prayes, <HI>Libera me ab homine malo, Deliuer me from the euill man, O Lord.</HI> Saint <HI>Augustine,</HI> after much study and scrutiny to find out this euill man, at last lights vpon him; <HI>ab ho|mine malo,</HI> that is, <HI>&agrave; me ipso: Deliuer me from the euill man,</HI> deliuer me from <HI>my selfe</HI>; Deliuer <HI>Au|gustine</HI> from <HI>Augustine</HI>; I am that <HI>euill</HI> man. So, of all Idolatries, God deliuer vs from a supersti|tious worship of our selues. Some haue Idolized their Princes, some their Mistresses, some their Manufactures; but they are innumerable that haue Idolized themselues. He is a rare man that hath no Idol, no little god in a boxe, no espe|ciall sinne in his heart, to which he giues vxori|ous and affectionate Indulgence.</P>
<P>The only way to mend all, is for euery man to begin with himself. In vain shall we blame those faults abroad, which we tolerate at home. That man makes himself ridiculous, who leauing his own house on fire, runs to quench his neigbors Let but euery man pull a brand from this fire, the flame will go out alone: if euery soule clense his owne Temple, all shall be quit of Idols, and God wil accept of all. A multitude is but a heap of vnities; the more we take away, the fewer we leaue behind. When a field is ouer growne with weeds, the best course to haue a good generall
<PB N="65" REF="108">
haruest, is for euery man to weed his owneground. When we would haue the street cleansed let euery man sweep his owne doore, and it is quickly done. But while euery man censures, &amp; none amends, we do but talk against Idols, with still vnclensed Te~ples.</P>
<P>Let vs pray for vniuersall repentance, like a good <HI>Iosias,</HI> to purge the houses of God. till lust and pro|fanenesse, pride and couetousnesse, fraud and wan|tonnesse, malice and drunkennes, be no more found among vs: till euery thing be cast out, and nothing let in, that is vncleane. So shall the Lord dwell in vs with content, and we shall dwell in him with com|fort. Here we shall be a Temple for Him, hereafter he shall be a temple for vs. So we find that glorious Citie describe, <HI>I saw no Temple therein,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reu. 21.22</NOTE> <HI>but the Lord God Almightie, and the Lambe was the Temple of it.</HI> Wee are Gods Temple on earth, God shall bee our Temple in heauen. To this purpose, the Spirit of God sanctifie vs, and bee for euer sanctified in vs. Amen.</P>
<P>Some may haply (long ere this) haue preuidica|ted in their censures; How is this <HI>O pus diet in die sou?</HI> What is all this to the businesse of the day? I might haue preuented the obiection, by comparing Idola|trie with Treason: the one being a breach of Alle|giance to the Lord, the other a breach of allegiance to the Lords Annointed. Idolatry is a Treason a|gainst God, and Treason is kind of Idolatry against the King. From both which the diuine grace, and our holy obedience deliuer vs all. I conclude with application to the Time.</P>
<P>This is one of those blessed dayes celebrated for the deliuerance of our gracious Soueraigne: and
<PB N="66" REF="109">
well may the deliuerance of a King, of such a King, deserue a day of gratulation. When God deliuers a priuate man, he doth, as it were, repeat his Creati|on: but the deliuerance of a King, is alwayes a choyce piece in the Lords Chronicle. The Story, how he was endangered, and how preserued, this place hath diuers times witnessed; and that in a more punctuall manner, then I haue either strength, or art, or time to match. A hard time it seemed to be, when a King was imprisoned, when he had no guard with him but his Innocency, no subiect but a Traytor. But there was a stronger with him, then all they could be against him. A good Prince hath more guards then one: he hath, 1. a subsidiary guard, con|sisting of morrall men. 2. An inward guard, the in|tegritie of his owne Conscience: 3. A spirituall guard, the prayers of his faithfull subiects. 4. A ce|lestial guard, the protection of diligent &amp; powerfull Angels. 5. A diuine guard, his Makers prouidence that fenceth him in with a wall of fire, which shall at once both preserue him, and consume his enemies.</P>
<P>But my purpose is not to bring your thoughts back to the view of his perill, but to stir your hearts vp to thankfulnesse for his preseruation. He is iustly styled, <HI>The Defender of the Faith:</HI> he hath euer de|fended the Faith, and the Faith hath euer defended him. Hee hath preserued the Temple of God from Idols, and therefore God hath preserued him from all his enemies. Surely that Prouidence, which de|liuered him from those early Conspiracies, where|with he hath been assaulted from his cradle, meant him for some extraordinary benefit, and matchlesse good to the Christian world. Hee that gaue him
<PB N="67" REF="109">
both life and Crowne(almost)together, hath still miraculously preserued them both, from all the ra|ging violences of Rome and Hell. Now when the Lord deliuered him, what did he else but euen deli|uer vs all? That we might reioyce in his safety, as the Romans did in the recouery of <HI>Germanicus</HI>; when they ran with lampes and sacrifices to the Capitoll, and there sung with shouts and acclamations; <HI>Salua Roma, salua Patria, saluus Germanicus:</HI> the Citie is safe, the Country is safe, and all in the safetie of <HI>Ger|manicus.</HI> While we consider the blessings which we enioy by his gracious Gouernment; that the estates we haue gotten with honest industry, may be safely conueyed to our posterity: that we sit vnder the sha|dow of peace, and may teach our children to know the Lord: that the good man may build vp Tem|ples and Hospitals, without trembling to thinke of sauage and barbarous violences to pull them down: that our Deuotions be not molested with vproares, nor men called from their callings by mutinies: that our Temples be not profaned with Idols, nor the Seruice of God blended with superstitious deuices: that our temporall estate is preserued in liberity, our spirituall estate may bee improued in pietie, and our eternall estate assured vs in glory: that our liues be protected, and in quiet our soules may be saued: for such a King of men, blesse we the God of Kings; and sing for his deliuera~ce, as they did for their <HI>Germani|cus</HI>; as priuatly euery day, so this day in our publike Assemblies; <HI>Salua Britannia, Salua Ecclesia, saluus</HI> IACOBVS: Our Kingdome is safe, the Church of God is safe, our whole Estate is safe, wee are all safe and happie, in the safetie and happinesse of King

IAMES. O that as we haue good cause to emulate, so also we would truly imitate the gratulation of <HI>Israel</HI>; we for our King that hath preserued the Temple,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Chron. 5.12.13.</NOTE> as they for their King that built the Temple; while the Leuites and singers stood with Harps and Cymbals and Viols, and the Priests blowing with Trumpets; as if they had all been one man, and made one sweet harmony to the praise of God.</P>
<P>For these publike &amp; extraordinary blessings, God requires publike and extraordinary praises: that this great Assembly with prepared hearts, and religious affections, should magnifie his glorious Name: &amp; if it were possible, by some vnusuall strain of our vnited tha~ks, pierce the very skies, &amp; giue an Eccho to those celestiall Quires, singing, Honor, &amp; praise, and glory, bee to our gracious God, for all his mercifull deliue|rances both of Prince and people. Yea, O Lord, still preserue thine own <HI>Annointed</HI>&punc; conuert or confound all his enemies; but vpon his dead let his Crown flo|rish. Long, long liue that royal keeper of Gods holy Temple, &amp; the <HI>Defender</HI> of that <HI>Faith</HI> which he hath of old giuen to his Saints: and let all true-hearted <HI>Is|raelites</HI> say, <HI>Amen:</HI> yea, let <HI>Amen,</HI> the faithfull witnes in heauen, the <HI>Word</HI> &amp; <HI>Truth</HI> of God, say <HI>Amen</HI> to it. For our selues, let vs heartily repent of our former sins, religiously amend our future liues, abandon all our intestine Idols, serue the Lord with pure hearts; and still, and still, God shall deliuer both Him and vs from all our enemies. This God grant for his mer|cies sake, <HI>Iesus Christ</HI> for his merits sake, the Holy+Ghost for his Names sake; to whom, three persons, and one eternall God, be all praise and glory, ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">di|ence and thanksgiuing, world without end.</P>
