The Right Honourable, the Lady
ARBELLA WENTVVORTH;
The accomplishment of her
Divinest wishes.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_SOme moneths are
past, since I made
bold to recom|mend
to my Right
Honorable LORD
your Husband, an
<HI>ENGLISH
GENTLEMAN;</HI>
whom hee was
pleased, forth of
his Noble disposi|on,
to receive into his Protection. Into whose
most Honourable service hee was no sooner en|tertained,
<PB REF="3">
and upon due observance of his inte|gritie
approved; then upon approvement of
his more piercive judgement, he became gene|rally
received. Out of these respects, my most
Honourable Lady, I became so encouraged, as
I have presumed to preferre unto your service
an <HI>ENGLISH GENTLEWOMAN,</HI>
one of the same Countrey and Family, a deser|ving
sister of so <HI>generous</HI> a brother: Or (if you
will) a pleasing Spouse to so <HI>gracious</HI> a Lover.
Whom, if your Honour shall be but pleased to
entertaine, (and your noble Candor is such, as
she can expect nothing lesse) you shall finde
excellently graced with sundry singular quali|ties,
beautified with many choice endowments&punc;
and so richly adorned with divers exquisite
ornaments, as her attendance shall be no dero|gation
to your Honour, nor no touch <HI>to your</HI>
unblemish'd <HI>Selfe,</HI> to retaine her in your favour.
Sure I am, the sweetnesse of her temper, sorts
and sutes well with the quality or disposition
of your Honour: For shee Loves without any
painted pretences to bee really vertuous, with|out
popular applause to be affably gracious,
without any glorious glosse to bee sincerely
zealous. Her Education hath so enabled her,
as shee can converse with you of all places, de|liver
her judgement conceivingly of most per|sons,
and discourse most delightfully of all
fashions. Shee hath beene so well Schooled in
the Discipline of this <HI>Age,</HI> as shee onely de|sires
<PB REF="3">
to retaine in memory that <HI>forme</HI> which is
least affected but most comely; to consort with
such as may improve her <HI>Knowledge</HI> and <HI>practise</HI>
of goodnesse by their company; to entertaine
those for reall and individuate friends, who
make actions of pietie expressivest characters
of theyr amity. Diligent you shall ever finde
her in her imployments, serious in her ad|vice,
temporate in her Discourse, discreet in
her answers. Shee bestowes farre more time in
eying the glasse of her life to rectifie her errors,
if there bee any, then the glasse of her face in
wiping of such outward staines as might ble|mish
her beautie. Neyther in preserving that,
is shee altogether so remisse, as not to retaine
that seemely grace in her feature, as may put
her in remembrance of the unexpressive beauty
and bounty of her Maker. Neate she goes usu|ally
in her attire, which she puts on with more
<HI>care</HI> then <HI>cost.</HI> And to these shee addes such a
well-seeming grace, as she bestowes more beau|ty
on them, then shee receives from them.
Phantasticke habits or forraine fashions are so
farre from taking her, as with a sleight but
sweet contempt they are disvalued by her. She
wonders how a wise state should employ so
much time in inventing varietie of disguises to
disfigure theyr <HI>Shape.</HI> This makes her desire
rather to bee out of request with time, then
with a civill and well-composed mind; whose
honour it is to bee prized more by her owne
<PB REF="4">
internall worth, then any outward weare.
Constant shee is in her <HI>behaviour;</HI> wherein she
<HI>affects</HI> little, but <HI>observes</HI> much. With a bash|full
admiration she smiles at these civilized si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|pring
Dames, whose onely glory it is to affect
a kind of reserved state; which, as they hold,
consists principally in a minc'd speech, set
looke, or ginger pace. Shee loves alwayes to
bee her selfe, nor to entertaine ought which
may estrange her from her selfe. So as, there is
nothing in the whole posture of her <HI>Behaviour,</HI>
but with a native gracefull propriety doth infi|nitely
become her. Take upon her to instruct
others, shee will not, such is her Humilitie; al|beit,
every moving posture which comes from
her, may be a line of direction unto others to
follow her. <HI>Complement</HI> shee affects not, as the
world takes it. The word in his owne native
and unborrowed signification is good, and in
that sence she admits it; but to be restrained to
an inforced formality, shee cannot relish it.
Whence it is, that she preferres the incompara|ble
Liberty of her mind, before the mutable
formality of a Deluded age. Shee desires to be
<HI>Compleat</HI> in the exercise of goodnesse; to im|prove
her Honour not by titles but a lovely
and lively proficience, graced with a continuate
practise in all vertues. She cannot indure this
later introduc'd kind of Complement, which
consists in Cringies, Congies, or supple salutes.
A cheerefull modesty is her best <HI>Complement,</HI>
<PB REF="4">
which shee ever weares about her as her chie|fest
ornament. <HI>Decency,</HI> shee affects in her
<HI>Cloathes,</HI> affability in her Discourse; shee hath
made a covenant with her eyes never to wan|der,
nor intentively to bestow themselves on
any other object than the glory of her Maker.
A proper personage is no such attractive mo|tive
to her eye, to make her loose her selfe.
Whatsoever shee undertakes beseemes her, be|cause
shee affects naught but what naturally be|comes
her. Her beauty is her owne; and
whatsoever else may better accomplish her.
Her pathes are evenly vertuous; her desires
truely religious; Piety is her practise; which
shee expresseth so fully in every action; as the
whole course of her well-disposed life is not so
much as justly conscious of the least aspersion.
So highly shee values her <HI>Estimation,</HI> as she will
not engage it to suspition. Promises cannot
tempt her, nor hope of advancement taint her.
She wonders one should preferre a conceit of
being <HI>great</HI> before a desire of appearing <HI>good.</HI>
Protesting Lovers she holds for no better then
deceiving Lures. Bee their vowes of <HI>seruice</HI>
never so incessant, their assaults never so vio|lent;
her resolves have vow'd her constant.
Hope of <HI>Profit</HI> cannot surprize her, nor
thought of <HI>Pleasure</HI> vainely delude her. <HI>Esti|mation</HI>
she holds her highest grace; with which
untainted shee purposeth to goe to her Grave.
Shee knowes how to <HI>fancie;</HI> and in her shee
<PB REF="5">
retaines what shee <HI>fancies</HI> most: A <HI>chast soule;</HI>
this is that she <HI>loves,</HI> and with which she cheere|fully
<HI>lives.</HI> Shee was neuer yet acquainted with
a passionate <HI>ah me;</HI> nor a carelesse folding of her
armes, as if the thought of a prevailing Lover
had wrought in her thoughts some violent Di|stemper.
So seriously doth she taske her selfe
to imployment, as she never reserues so much
time as to treate of so light a Subject. Yet shee
unfainedly vowes, that if it be ever her fortune
to make her <HI>choyce,</HI> her constant affection must
never admit any <HI>Change.</HI> To be <HI>Generous</HI> in e|very
action, hath beene ever the height of her
ambition. Howsoever she might boast of <HI>Des|cent,</HI>
her desire is to raise it by <HI>Desert.</HI> Shee
holds, no family can bee truely <HI>Generous,</HI> un|lesse
it be nobly vertuous. Her <HI>life</HI> must ex|presse
the <HI>line</HI> from whence shee came. Shee
scornes to entertaine one thought below her
selfe. Or to detract from the glory of that
house from whence she came. As the blood
that streames through her veines was nobly
Derived, so must it not by any <HI>action</HI> or <HI>affection</HI>
drawne from the rule of her direction, become
corrupted. For <HI>Honour,</HI> she admits it, but sel|dome
or never admires it; the <HI>Staires</HI> by which
she meanes to clime to it, must be faire &amp; firme,
or she will never mount them. She rather ad|mires
the Ages folly; while shee observes how
many hazard their high-priz'd liberty, for a
vading glimpse of popular glory. Her desires
<PB REF="5">
are higher seated, where they are onely to bee
sated. A secure State consists not in <HI>styles</HI> but
<HI>vertues,</HI> which are <HI>Honours</HI> surest stayes. There|fore
her highest <HI>Honour</HI> reflects on her Creator,
wherein she is so farre from fearing, as shee is
ever wishing more <HI>Corrivals.</HI> THIS is the
<HI>GENTLEWOMAN</HI> whom I have presumed
heere to present vnto your <HI>Ladiships</HI> seruice;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Such, to your <HI>Honour,</HI> is her zealous affecti|on, as shee makes it the sole Apologie of her Pre|sumption: which shee weaves vp in this Dimensi|on:</NOTE>
whose sweete converse will at retired houres
afford you choicest solace. Neyther, should
you ranke her amongst the lowest of your me|ney,
will it displease her, such is her Humility:
for she hath learned as well to <HI>obey</HI> as <HI>command.</HI>
Nor will she spare for any paines, so her dili|gence
may please. Onely (<HI>Madam</HI>) be pleased to

favour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To serve some <HI>GREAT ONES</HI> l've bene oftimes wood.</NOTE> to shrowd her bashfull endeavours un|der

<HEAD>TO THE
GENTLEVVOMAN
READER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEVVOMEN:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Have heere presented
vnto your view one of
your owne Sexe; One,
whose improved Educa|tion
will bee no blemish
but a beautie to her Na|tion.
Peruse her, and I
make little doubt, but
you will so approve of
her Behaviour, as you shall acknowledge her right
worthy the title of a <HI>Sister.</HI> More shall you
finde in her, by freely conversing with her, than
in those <HI>YOVNG</HI> but loose <HI>ENGLISH
GENTLEWOMEN,</HI> whose long mer|cinarie
Prostitution vpon the <HI>Stall,</HI> hath brought
them out of Request, and made them grow too
<HI>Stale,</HI> by being exposed to publike <HI>Sale.</HI> Ma|ny
Countries hath shee coasted, sundry Dangers
<PB REF="7">
accoasted, Courts and Cities hath shee frequen|ted,
to returne home better freighted, and re-con|vey
the benefit of that fraught to this <HI>Iland,</HI> where
shee was first bred and now arrived. Doe yee itch
after <HI>Fashion?</HI> She is for you; yet not that, which
the vanity of this Age admits; but what Modestie
onely affects. She hath observ'd much in forraine
Courts, which deserv'd rather <HI>Contempt</HI> than
<HI>Imitation;</HI> this shee would not for a world intro|duce
into a well-govern'd <HI>State;</HI> so tender shee
is of her Fame, as no <HI>place</HI> nor <HI>person</HI> shall derive
from her the least staine. Whatsoever shee hath
commended to be seene, is no lesse fully than faith|fully
showne, and with that temporate style drawne,
as in every line some one precept of <HI>Vertue</HI> seemes
to shine. Neither in this her strict or serious Ob|servation
of Times, doth shee resemble those <HI>La|miae,</HI>
who vse to take their eyes with them when
they goe abroad, but lye them aside when they come
home: No; so little doth shee favour her selfe, as
shee preferres others Censures before her owne; and
in no one particular so much expresseth her owne
true glory, as in the constant practise of Humilitie.
Hence it is, that shee is no curious pryer into others
actions, nor too cens<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rious a reproover of others
Directio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s; being indeed, a <HI>TYRESIAS</HI> in the
eying or descrying of others errors, an <HI>ARGUS</HI> in
her owne. What is good and amiable in the eye
of Vertue, she imbraceth with an affectionate tender;
making it her highest honour, to promote the glory
of her Maker. But least by being too serious, shee
<PB REF="7">
might become tedious; she will not sticke to walke
abroad with you into more pleasing groves or pa|stures
of Delight: where shee will converse with
you of Love, and intermixe her Discourse with
such time-beguiling Tales as varietie shall no lesse
sharpen your attention, then the modesty of her
Method beget admiration. Every Subiect she treats
of, you shall finde so equally tempered with <HI>profit</HI>
and <HI>delight;</HI> as the one shall no lesse benefit your
minde, than the other solace your Eare. Shee
can reprove without <HI>gall,</HI> blush without <HI>guilt,</HI> love
without <HI>guile,</HI> live without <HI>gaine.</HI> Her <HI>gaine</HI> is
to purchase <HI>vertue</HI> more followers; her <HI>guile,</HI> to de|prive
the <HI>world</HI> of her favourers; her <HI>guilt,</HI> to
defeat all vitious pioners; her <HI>gall,</HI> to disrelish all
Voluptuous practisers. She can discourse of Love
without lightnesse; converse with Love without
loosenesse; and consort with those shee loves with|out
leudnesse. She knowes how to retaine a seeme|ly
state without pride; to expresse her selfe praise|worthy
without selfe-praise; and in all her acti|ons
to make <HI>Vertue</HI> her highest prize. <HI>Humilitie,</HI>
which is the princesse of Vertues, the conqueresse of
Vices, the mirror of Virgins, and Crowne of Chri|stians,
shee so much honours, as shee values it above
all humane glory: whence it is, that shee hath e|ver
reapt more spirituall profit by <HI>dis-esteeme</HI> then
<HI>selfe-esteeme.</HI> Day by day shee recreates herselfe
in her <HI>Garden</HI> of <HI>goodwill;</HI> and in her recreati|on,
shee makes this her soule-solacing Meditation:
<HI>Who be they that neighbour neare me, and
<PB REF="8">
whose weake estates stand in need of me?</HI> Con|cluding
with this charitable resolution: <HI>There is
none so poore, but to my power I will relieve,
so long as I live, for the honour of his Image
whom I love.</HI> Shee devides her day into houres,
her houres into holy taskes. Employment takes a|way
all occasions of distraction. Should she suffer
a light or indisposed thought to worke upon her ima|gination:
or giue way to any such intruder to di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">sturbe
the peace of her <HI>inward house,</HI> she would en|dure
her selfe worse for many yeares; and inflict
vpon her extravagant affections such a censure, as
might deterre them thenceforth to wander. She
distastes none more than these <HI>busie house-wives,</HI>
who are ever running into discourse of others fami|lies,
but forget their owne. Neither holdes shee it
sufficient to be onely an <HI>House-keeper;</HI> or Snayle-like
to be still vnder roofe: she partakes therefore of
the <HI>Pismire</HI> in providing, of the <HI>Sarreptan</HI> wid|dow
in disposing: holding ever an absent providence
better then an improvident presence. She is no
common frequenter of publique feasts, but if neigh|bourhood
require it, she will admit of it: wherein
she demeanes her selfe so civilly, as there is no dis+creete
person but ioyes in her society. There is no|thing
must beget in her a distemper, having ever
a tender eye o're her honour. In the report of others
praises she is attentive, but deafe to her owne. Bee
she in places of publique resort or privately retyr'd,
she ever enioyes her selfe; neither can excesse of
mirth transport her; or any crosse occurrent much
<PB REF="8">
perplexe her. There is nought that aliens her mind
more from those with whom shee consorts, than an
immodest discourse, which shee interrupts with a
discreet anger. Wheresoever she sets her rest, shee
makes <HI>Vertue</HI> her guest, whom she entertaines with
so sweet an embrace, as nothing can divide them:
so firme and inviolable is the league that is be|twixt
them. She conceives no small delight in E|ducating
the young and unexperienced Damsels of
your sexe: wherein she retaines an excellent facul|ty
and facility. It shall not be amisse therefore for
you who have Daughters, to recommend them to
her direction; whose government is such, as neither
her too much indulgence shall spoile them; nor re|straint
dull them. Whatsoever she in many yeares
hath learned (so desirous is shee to benefit where
her <HI>Observations</HI> may afford profit) she is wil|ling
to impart; to the end shee may procure <HI>her</HI>
mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> servants, whom she<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> religiously hath ever
vow'd to serve. Long hath she beene a Learner,
neyther is she asham'd to be so still. Onely for <HI>ver|tues</HI>
honour, is shee become a Teacher; that the
<HI>Younger</HI> may be instructed by those that are <HI>El|der;</HI>
the vndisciplin'd by such as are riper. Ney|ther
shall you find her slow in performing, what she
hath so perfectly learned. For her very Life is a
continued line of Direction, being solely dedicated
to a vertuous profession. St. <HI>Cyprian</HI> did sharpe|ly
reprove a rich woman, for comming into the
Lords Temple without her Oblation: But this re|proofe
she would be loath iustly to incurre: there|fore
<PB REF="9">
she goes better prepar'd, that her portion of
Glory may be sooner shar'd: having an Oblation in
her hand, Devotion in her heart, and a Crowne of
consolation in hope. You then, who love modesty,
entertaine her; for she will sort well with your hu|mour,
and through her acquaintance improve your
honour. For such who sacrifice the Morne to their
Classe, the Afternoone to the Stage, and Evening to
revelling; she holds no correspondence with them.
These she holds for no employments; nor the Profes|sors
of them worthy her knowledge. They must not a|buse
time, that are commended to her trust. She is
not so weary of time, neither doth she so disvalue it,
as with such impertinences to consume it. Those like|wise,
who preferre <HI>Fashion</HI> before <HI>Decency,</HI> formal
<HI>Punto'es</HI> before reall <HI>Formality,</HI> &amp; will suffer the~|selves
to be deluded by Vanity; they must not be ad|mitted
into her family. She hath learned <HI>better
things</HI> than to foole her selfe in a painted disguise, or
to labor of that Vniversall disease, which the corrup|tion
of a full and flourishing State usually produceth.
She hath learned with that <HI>better Sister,</HI> to <HI>chuse</HI>
the <HI>better part.</HI> Constant be her purposes, content|ment
her desires, consonant her delights. Be it then
your <HI>honour</HI> to be informed by her, seeing her in|structions
are equally mixt with <HI>profit</HI> and <HI>plea|sure.</HI>
Now if you obiect, that shee hath beene too
flow in comming, seeing her <HI>GENTLEMAN</HI>
so long since arrived; heare mine answer; and sus|pend
your Censure, by imputing this fault to our
English Error. Where <HI>Venus</HI> is longer in trim|ming,
<PB REF="9">
than <HI>Mars</HI> in training. Many provisions
were required by her, before the World were to be
possessed of her. Much likewise expected from
her, before the World had knowledge of her; this
made her the longer to retire, that shee might pro|fit
the more in her returne. May you,
<HI>Gentlewomen,</HI> bee the instance of it; so shall
both the <HI>Author</HI> and his <HI>labour</HI> reioyce in it.
To draw then to a Conclusion, lest my <HI>Portell</HI>
rise too high for my <HI>building;</HI> as you are not
to expect from her any guga-tyres, toyes, or trifles;
love-sented gloves, amorous potions, perfumed pi|ctures,
or love-sicke pouders; so shee doubts not, but
to finde in you an <HI>Eare,</HI> prompt to attention; a
<HI>Tongue,</HI> cleare of invection; a <HI>Spirit,</HI> free from
detraction? with an <HI>Heart</HI> apt to harbour affection.</P>
<P>Now for the <HI>Volume,</HI> I had purposely made it
more portable, that it might become your more so|ciable
follower; had not my observation told mee,
that albeit <HI>amiablenesse</HI> consist in a lovely feature,
the <HI>goodlinesse</HI> of a <HI>Gentlewoman</HI> rests in her
comely Stature. Besides, this corresponded better
with the Portraiture of the <HI>ENGLISH
GENTLEMAN,</HI> her affianc'd Lover. For
the <HI>Margin,</HI> I have not charg'd it with many Notes,
lest you should neglect the <HI>Garment,</HI> by being taken
too much with the <HI>border.</HI> Improve it to
your best profite, and let <HI>GOD</HI> have
the glorie of it.</P>

made him flye to the

shame compelled him
to play the artlesse Tay|ler,
and through meere
<HI>necessity</HI> to make him a
Couer. Well enough
was he before that time attyred, albeit naked: and
<PB N="2" REF="25">
so happily stated, as we are to imagine, that igno|rance
kept him not from the knowledge of his na|kednesse,
but that his Originall purity freed him
from these necessities. But no sooner was the forbid|den
fruit tasted, then poore <HI>Adam</HI> became tainted,
his nakednesse discouered; so as now for honour of
modesty, he must of <HI>necessity</HI> betake himselfe to that
<HI>science,</HI> whereto (being <HI>free</HI> till that time) he was ne|uer
<HI>bound Apprentice.</HI> His inhibited taste made him
sensible (and therein more miserable) of what be|fore
he felt not. No distemperature of cold or heat
could before that time annoy him. Now his failing
in performing what he ought, brings him to a feeling
of that he neuer knew. Now tender <HI>Eue,</HI> whose tem|perate
repose ministred her all content in a sweet
and cheerefull Arbour, with all the varieties and de|licacies
of nature, feeles a shaking &amp; shiuering in her
ioynts: Such a strange distemper hath the tast of an
Apple wrought in her. Shee must fit her selfe then
to endure that with patience, which she procur'd to
her selfe and second selfe, through disobedience; and
put on what before she needed not, a Vaile to couer
her Nakednesse, and subiect her selfe to these Neces|sities.
It is true, that <HI>Cloathing</HI> keeps the body warme
two wayes: By keeping in the naturall heat of the
body; and by keeping out the accidentall cold of
the Ayre. All Creatures enter the world sheelded
and shrouded, saue onely poore man, who enters
lists naked. Tender and delicate hee is by nature;
more subiect to preiudice by distemper, than any o+ther
Creature. Now to fence himselfe against all
occurrents, and the better to endure all intemperate
violence, the Diuine Prouidence hath accommoda|ted
it selfe to his <HI>Necessity,</HI> from the very first en|trance
of his <HI>infancy:</HI> yet were it fit, when hee re|flects
vpon himselfe thus decked and attired, to recal
<PB N="3" REF="25">
to minde the prime occasion of these <HI>Necessities.</HI> So
equally tempered was the Ayre where he first brea|thed;
so farre from the distemper of heat or cold
freed; with such variety of all delights stored; as
then in all happinesse he seem'd to be stated: but pre|sently
after his fall, began these to faile. That soyle,
which before was naturally fruitfull, became wilde
without manuring: Those Riuers, which before
were purely relishing and delighitng, became mud|dy,
brackish, and distasting: Yea, that Ayre, which
before was euer sweetly and temperately breathing,
became vnseasonably scorching or freezing. <HI>Neces|sity</HI>
then hath prouided for <HI>Adam</HI> and his Collapsed
posterity a Coat, to shroud them from the incle|mency
of all seasons. And whence came this <HI>necessi|ty,</HI>
but from sinne? To glory then in these <HI>necessities,</HI>
is to glory in sinne. Which were, as if some graue
Capitall offender, hauing committed high Treason
against his Soueraigne, should, notwithstanding, out
of a Princely Clemency be pardoned; yet with this
condition, that hee should weare a Cord or Halter a|bout
his necke during his life, to put him in remem|brance
of his disloyalty and treason. In which Badge,
this frontlesse Traytor should pride himselfe more,
than if it were some ancient Crest of honour. Re|flect
then vpon the originall source of your sorrow,
<HI>Eue,</HI> ye daughters of <HI>Eue.</HI> Ambition prompt her to
sin, sin brought her to shame, shame to her shroud.
Meere <HI>necessity</HI> compelled her to weare what before
she knew not, and to prouide her selfe of that which
before she needed not. How is it then, that these
ragges of sinne, these robes of shame, should make
you idolize your selues? How is it, that yee conuert
that which was ordained for <HI>necessity,</HI> to feed the
light-flaming fuell of licentious liberty? Was <HI>Ap|parell</HI>
first intended for keeping in naturall heat, and
<PB N="4" REF="26">
keeping out accidentall cold? How comes it then
that you weare these thinne Cobweb attires, which
can neither preserue heat, nor repell cold? Of what
an incurable cold would these Butterfly-habits pos|sesse
the wearer, were pride sensible of her selfe?
Sure, these attires were not made to keepe cold out,
but to bring cold in. No <HI>necessity,</HI> but meere vanity,
introduced these Pye-coloured fopperies amongst
vs. Vnuaile many of our light Curtezans, whose
brothell practice hath reft them of the ornament of
a woman, and you will finde a strange Metamor|phosis;
<HI>Venus armata</HI> turn'd to <HI>Venus calua.</HI> We say
there is no good congruity in a proud heart and a
beggers purse. Why should we then pride our selues
in that which displayes our beggery? Before wee
had cloathes, we wanted nothing; hauing cloathes,
we stand in need of all things. Primitiue purity ex|empted
vs from these <HI>necessities;</HI> Originall impurity
subiected vs to these <HI>necessities.</HI> Cold wee grew in
Charity, cold in euery Christian duty; garments
then stood wee in need of, to shroud vs against the
tempest of a benummed Conscience. These habits
then, it appeares, were ordained, at first, for <HI>neces|sity</HI>
to shield vs: Vanity had not then set inuention
on worke, nor the age sent her Phantastickes abroad
to trafficke with sorraine fashions. Winter made
choyce of his garment to fit the season; so did Sum|mer,
without an affected singularity, fit him to a
seasonable fashion. They stood not much either vp|on
colour or curious border; temperate heat they
desired to retaine, intemperate to repell; cold to
keepe out, naturall warmth to keepe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">in. This was
that, ancient times intended; this was all that they
affected. <HI>Necessity</HI> enforced them to doe what they
did; otherwise, I am perswaded, they had not beene,
to this day, made. Those then that esteeme more of
<PB N="5" REF="26">
<HI>Apparell,</HI> how gorgeous soeuer, than of a worke of
<HI>Necessity,</HI> detract from their owne glory, to sute
themselues in stuffes of vanity.</P>
<P>THere is nothing in its owne nature so absolute|ly
good,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The vse of <HI>Apparell.</HI></NOTE> but it may be corrupted; what was
at first intended for some good <HI>Vse,</HI> if peruerted, de|clines
into some apparant <HI>Abuse.</HI> Now <HI>Gentlewomen,</HI>
(for to you I direct this discourse) would you ob|serue
the right <HI>vse,</HI> and diuert in no particular from
the Ordinance of <HI>Apparell;</HI> Modesty must be your
guide, vertuous thoughts your guard, so shall hea|uen
bee your goale. When the Roman Princes, in
their Conquests, or triumphant honours, were with
acclamations and vollies of salutes receiued, by the
generall applause of the people extolled, and in their
triumphall <HI>Eb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">r</HI> or Chayre of estate seated; there
stood alwayes one behind them in their Throne, to
pull them by the sleeue with this Memoriall; <HI>Re|member
thou art mortall.</HI> A more vsefull Memoriall
you cannot haue, than these Robes you weare, of
your owne frailty, nor a more effectuall motiue to
humility. Had not sinne worne you out of Gods <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">a|uour,
and reft you of your natiue splendour, you
had neuer worne these habits, signals of your dis|honour.
I commend her for the good vse which she
made of her <HI>Apparell,</HI> who neuer dyed her garment,
but shee watred it with a teare, remembring what
<HI>necessities</HI> her ambitious thoughts had brought her
to: for by aspiring to know more than shee did, she
became depriued of that excellent beauty which she
had. Patternes likewise of modesty you may be, and
herein singularly vsefull by your examples, vnto o|thers
of your sexe. Nor can you possibly expresse it
better, then in obseruing that diuine precept, by lear|ning
<PB N="6" REF="27">
how to <HI>array your selues in comely apparell, with
sham<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> fastnesse and modesty, not with broided haire, or
gold, or pearles, or costly apparell: But, as becommeth
women that professe the feare of God. For euen after this
manner in time past did the holy women, which trusted in
God, tire themselues.</HI> Here is a prescript forme by way
of direction; for your habit. Choicer ornaments you
cannot haue to adorne you; nor any fashion that
will better seeme you. Where you walke, you may
enioy your selues freed from light eyes, gazing and
admiring vanity: your very <HI>habit</HI> is your <HI>Testate</HI> to
witnesse for you: loose thoughts nestle not in your
bosome, nor doe wandring distractions surprise your
breast: you haue learned to your highest solace, euen
in euery motion, action, posture, gesture, to obserue
modesty, as an ornament to honour. For, seeing that
the very habit of the minde may bee best discerned
and discouered by the state or carriage of the body,
the disposition of the body by the habit; to auoyd
scandall, and retaine that Christian opinion which e|uery
one ought to preserue, wee are to make choyce
of that attire, which conferres most seeming graui|ty
on vs. This the very Heathen, whose best dire|ction
was morality, were carefull of: for in the <HI>vse</HI>
of <HI>Apparell,</HI> they retained such constant course, as
they held it the greatest blemish they could asperse
vpon their Nation, to introduce any new or exo|ticke
fashion, either to effeminate the dispositions
of their people, or to derogate from the honour of
their memorable predecessours; whose modell was
their direction in habit, and all other obseruable cu|stomes.
What a simple, honest Rusticity our An|cestors
retained in their weare, might bee easily di|scerned,
if wee should make recourse to one of their
ancient Wardrobes; where antiquity may prescribe
for many ages, and constancy second what antiquity
<PB N="7" REF="27">
had introduc'd. Yea, so obseruant were former times
of those fashions which preceding ages had recom|mended
to them, as they held it ominous to inno|uate
or bring in any new forme, euen in matters of
indifferency. When <HI>Darius</HI> had altered the fashion
of his Sword, which vsed to be Persian, into the
forme of the Macedonian (in the yeere immediately
before he fought with <HI>Alexander)</HI> the Chaldees or
Sooth-sayers prophecied, that into what fashion as
<HI>Darius</HI> had altered his Sword, time would reduce his
State; and that the Persian glory was drawing to|wards
her last period, by subiecting her selfe to the
Soueraignty of Macedon. Which prediction was
soone confirmed by the next yeeres Conquest. But
tell me, ye curious Dames, who hold it a derogation
to your honour, to entertaine ought that is vulgar;
whereto were Cloathes first ordained, but to couer
that nakednesse which sinne brought, and to skreene
that shame which the effect of sinne first wrought?
The <HI>vse</HI> of <HI>Apparell</HI> is not to dignifie the wearer, or
adde more beauty to the Creature. Sure I am, that a
iudicious eye, who measures dignity by desert,
scornes to preferre the <HI>Case</HI> before the <HI>Instrument,</HI>
the <HI>Rinde</HI> before the <HI>Pith.</HI> Those who are worthy
to be your Iudges, will determine your worth by
what there is in you, not by what you weare on you.
Let May-games and Morrices beautifie themselues
with Anticke dressings, to captiuate the vulgar eye;
your breeding hath beene better, your iudgements
clearer, your obseruations wiser, than to stoope to
such base Lures. Our life consists in the perfection
or temperate infusion of naturall or radicall humour,
or in the conseruation of naturall heat: to preserue
this, to increase that, Nature hath prouided meanes
inward and outward. To inuert the <HI>vse,</HI> is to per|uert
the <HI>Ordinance</HI> it selfe: So <HI>vse</HI> the outward, that
<PB N="8" REF="28">
you darken not the inward; so dispose of the in|ward,
that it may rectifie the outward. Reflect on
antiquity, yet no farther than may suit with the de|cency
of the age wherein you liue. I am not igno|rant,
how many fashions formerly vsed, would in
this age deserue rather derision than approuement.
And that the infancy of the world had many shapes,
as then but onely in their <HI>Embrio</HI> or rather Concep|tion,
which succeeding times, accommodated by
more exquisite artists, brought afterwards to per|fection.
<HI>Vse</HI> your habit as an ornament of decency;
let it not haue the least Edging of vanity. Many
Eyes are fixed on you, sundry motiues of imitation
are deriued from you. Send not out one fruitlesse
sigh for any phantasticke fashion which you see:
they cannot be sighes of compassion, that are sent
meerely out for fashion. Sigh rather that your
Country should labour of so vaine a birth, as to
preferre forraine inuentions before the ornament of
a <HI>Maiden Ile,</HI> constant modesty. Spend not a fruit|lesse
houre in an vnprofitable garnish of corruption:
<HI>Vse</HI> these outward dressings as if you did not <HI>vse</HI>
them: Let them be rather your <HI>scorne</HI> than your <HI>pride;</HI>
your <HI>contempt</HI> than <HI>content.</HI> Be those curious Cases
of mortality decked or dawbed with neuer so much
adulterate beauty, they cannot conferre vpon them|selues
one beameling of lasting glory. Looke vpon
those poore <HI>bases</HI> of frailty, your <HI>feet,</HI> what a <HI>tinkling</HI>
they make, to partake of a lasciuious meeting in pri|uacy:
Eye those <HI>rising mounts,</HI> your <HI>displayed breasts,</HI>
with what shamelesse art they wooe the shamefaste
passenger: View those <HI>wandring Lamps,</HI> how they
roue abroad, as if they would flye out of their
Lodges, and spheere themselues in some amorous
Orbe. Call them home, lest <HI>Dina<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>-like they lose
themselues by straying, impeach their honour by
<PB N="9" REF="28">
wandring, bring themselues woe by their lasciuious
wooing. Affect no fashion that may beget in your
generous bosomes a light thought; Contemne that
fashion which detracts from the natiue beauty of
the feature, or which brings it to that admiration of
the Creature, as it makes it forgetfull of the Crea|tor.
O how contemptible a thing is man (the word
may reflect equally vpon either sexe) if he erect not
his thoughts aboue man! What a poore <HI>vse</HI> makes
that miserable creature of his being here, who be|stowes
so much time in the <HI>Tyring house,</HI> as hee for|gets
what part he is to play on the Stage? O consi|der
the preciousnesse of time! it is all that may bee
properly said ours. Neither can we terme that por|tion
of time which we call <HI>ours,</HI> yeares, or dayes, or
houres. A moment is our portion, and the Com|mandingst
Emperour hath no larger proportion. Of
which moment, whatsoeuer is past, is not now;
and whatsoeuer is to come, is not yet. Eye then
your Houre-glasse, vye in teares with graines of
sand. Bestow not this little scantling, this moment
shorter than nothing, in too curiously attiring of
vanity, but in meditating of your owne frailty, and
redeeming the time you haue lost in security. As
<HI>Apparell</HI> was ordained for <HI>necessity; vse</HI> it with Chri|stian
ciuility. In obseruing this, you make the <HI>vse</HI>
good, which shall hereafter redound to your grea|ter
gaine.</P>
<P>O But the misery and leuity of this age is such,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Abuse <HI>of</HI> Apparell.</NOTE>
as that becomes generally least aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">cted, which
adornes vs most; that valued most, which beseemes
vs least. Time was indeed, and may that time once
re-shine vpon vs, when the onely flower to beloued
of women, was a natiue red, which was shamefast|nesse.
<PB N="10" REF="29">
The face knew not then what painting was,
whose adulterate <HI>shape</HI> takes now acquaintance from

to Christian eyes, which vsed painting their
skinne, powdring their hayre, darting their eye.
Our Commerce with forraine Nations was not for
fashions, feathers, and follies. There was distinction
in our attires; differences of ranks and qualities; a
ciuill obseruance of decent habits; which confer|red
no lesse glory on our Ile at home, than victori|ous
mannagements by the prowesse of our Inhabi|tants,
did abroad. If we reflect on them, wee must
of necessity blush at our selues: seeing, what wee
haue receiued for <HI>vse,</HI> we haue conuerted to <HI>abuse&punc;</HI>
That distinction which decency found out for ha|bits
vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ile and feminine, what commixture hath it
found in latter times? What neare resemblance and
relation hath womans to mans: suting their light
feminine skirts with manlike doublets? <HI>Semiramis,</HI>
that victorious Princesse, commanded all to weare
<HI>Tyres</HI> vpon their heads, and to put vpon them wo|mans
apparell without distinction, that shee might
reigne securely without exception: Thus the come|ly
habit of modesty became a pretended vaile to an
vsurped Soueraignty. But these succeeding times
haue tyred our women with tyres; translating them
to a plume of Feathers. Fashion is now euer vn|der
saile: the Inuention euer teeming; Phantasticke
Wits euer breeding. More time spent how to <HI>abuse</HI>
time, and corrupt licentious youth, than how to ad|dresse
employment for the one, or to rectifie the di|stempers
of the other. Take a suruey of all degrees,
and tell me what vniformity you finde in this par|ticular.
And to make instance in three seuerall pla|ces
(for to these all others may haue proper relation)
take a more precise and punctuall perusall of <HI>City,
<PB N="11" REF="29">
Court,</HI> and <HI>Countrey,</HI> and returne me a briefe of your
Suruey. In the <HI>first,</HI> you shall finde many graue Ma|trons,
modest Maids, deuout Widdowes; but are
these all? No; with these you shall finde a strange|ly
mixt generation. Some affecting nothing more
than what is most nouell and phantasticke; Others
enuying what they disdainfully see in others, which
fashion rather than they will misse, they will not
sticke to set their honour at sale: All, or most, true
<HI>Biantines,</HI> carrying all their wealth about them. For
the <HI>second,</HI> you shall find, amongst many other plants
of promising growth and excellent proficience, sun|dry
sweet-sented sprigs of <HI>Cynnamon,</HI> whose rinde is
worth all the body. No discourse can rellish their
formall palate, but fashion; if <HI>Eues</HI> Kirtle should
be now showne them, how they would geere their
Grandam? For the <HI>last,</HI> though it be long ere they
creepe into forme, hauing once attain'd it, they can
take vpon them as vnbeseeming a State in a Coun|trey
Pew, as if they were Ladies for that yeare, and
had beene bred in the Art of mincing since their
childhood. But what are these, but such, whose ex|pence
of time is scarcely valued? Sacrificing more
houres to their Looking-glasse, than they reserue
minutes to lament their defects. Such, whose vertu|ous
thoughts neuer harbour the least conceit that
may betray their honour, or depraue those more no|ble
parts wherewith they are indowed; scorne to
drowne their <HI>better part</HI> in these dregs of sensuality.
Vertue is their attendant, Honour their obiect, all
inferiour delights their lowest subiects. Day by
day haue these their taske imposed, that the poyson
of sloath may be better auoyded: No day passeth
without a line, no action without a limit: obser|uing
the course of that vertuous Mirror, of whom it
is said:
<Q><PB N="12" REF="30">
<L>In distinct houres she did diuide the day,</L>
<L>To walke, to worke, to meditate, and pray.</L></Q></P>
<P>Much different from this pious resolution, was
that Libertines impious conclusion, who held that
none could bee frequently deuout in prayer, and
fashionably decent in attire. Shee bestowed too
much time on her <HI>Glasse,</HI> to reserue any for her
Lampe. Pride had exiled her zeale; delicacy of ha|bit,
sanctity of heart. Her day might be easily diui|ded:
Shee bestowed the forenoone on her skinne,
the afternoone on a Play, clozing her Euening Le|cture
with a reere supper: and this was her Christi|an
Taske. Miserable is the condition of that Crea|ture,
who, so her skin be sleake, cares not if her soule
be rough. So her outward habit be pure and without
blemish, values little her inward garnish. Such an
one hath made a firme Contract with vanity, clo|zing
her contemptuous age with a fearefull Cata|strophe.
Thus farre haue we discoursed of the effect
or <HI>abuse</HI> it selfe, wee are now to treat of those two
sources, from whence these <HI>abuses</HI> properly arise; to
wit, <HI>Delicacy</HI> in being more curious in our Choyce
of <HI>Apparell</HI> than <HI>necessity</HI> or <HI>decency</HI> doth require; se|condly,
<HI>Superfluity,</HI> in storing more variety and
change of rayments than either nature needs, or
reason would admit, were shee not transported with
a sensuall affection, by giuing way to what vnboun|ded
appetite requires.</P>
<P>IN the search of any Minerall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the <HI>vse</HI> of <HI>Apparell</HI> may be inuer|ted to <HI>abuse.</HI></NOTE> we are first to digge
for the veine; and in the curing of any maleuo|lent
effect, we are duely and seriously to inquire the
producing cause, that by stopping the Spring or
source, wee may stay the violence of the streame.
We are then to insist of those two precedent means,
<PB N="13" REF="30">
by which the <HI>vse</HI> may bee inuerted to <HI>abuse;</HI> and
that which of it selfe is approueable, if obserued with
decency, becomes iustly reprehensible by corrupting
so necessary and consequent an <HI>vse,</HI> either by <HI>de|licacy,</HI>
which weakens and effeminates the <HI>spirit,</HI> or
by <HI>Superfluity,</HI> which euer darkens the beameling
of <HI>reason</HI> with the Cloud of <HI>sense.</HI></P>
<P>Reproofe touching <HI>Apparell</HI> may bee occasioned
from foure respects:</P>
<P>First, when any one weareth <HI>Apparell</HI> aboue their
degree, exceeding their estate in precious attire.
Whence it is that <HI>Gregory</HI> saith; there be some who
are of opinion, that the weare of precious or sump<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tuous
<HI>Apparell</HI> is no sinne: Which if it were no
fault, the diuine Word would neuer haue so punctu|ally
expressed, nor historically related, how the
<HI>Rich man,</HI> who was tormented in hell, was cloathed
with Purple and Silke. Whence we may note, that
touching the matter or subiect of attire, humane cu|riosity
auaileth highly. The first stuffe or substance
of our garments, was very meane; to wit, Skinne
with Wooll. Whence it is we read, that God made
<HI>Adam</HI> and his wife <HI>Coats of Skinnes,</HI> that is, of the
Skinnes of dead beasts. Afterwards (see the grada|tion
of this vanity deriued from humane singulari|ty)
they came to <HI>Pure Wooll,</HI> because it was lighter
than Skinnes. After that to <HI>rindes of trees,</HI> to wit,
<HI>Flax.</HI> After that to the <HI>dung and ordure of Wormes,</HI> to
wit, <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ke.</HI> Lastly, to <HI>Gold and Siluer, and precious
Stones.</HI> Which preciousnesse of attire highly displea|seth
God. For instance whereof (which the very
Pagans themselues obserued) we read that the very
first among the <HI>Romans,</HI> whoeuer wore <HI>Purple,</HI> was
strucke with a Thunder-bolt, and so dyed suddenly,
for a terror and mirror to all succeeding times, that
none should attempt to lift himselfe proudly against
<PB N="14" REF="31">
God in precious attire.</P>
<P>The second point reprehensible is, <HI>Softnesse</HI> or <HI>De|licacy</HI>
of <HI>Apparell:</HI> Soft Cloathes introduce soft
mindes. Delicacy in the <HI>habit,</HI> begets an <HI>effeminacy</HI> in
the <HI>heart. Iohn Baptist,</HI> who was sanctified in his mo|thers
wombe, wore sharpe and rough garments.
Whence wee are taught, that the true seruant of
God is not to weare garments for beauty or de|light,
but to couer his nakednesse; not for State
or Curiosity, but necessity and conuenience. Christ
saith in his Gospell, <HI>They that are clad in soft ray|ments,
are in Kings houses.</HI> Whence appeareth a
maine difference betwixt the seruants of Christ and
of this world. The seruants of this world seeke de|light,
honour, and pleasure in their attire; whereas
the seruants of Christ so highly value the gar|ment
of innocence, as they loath to staine it with
outward vanities. It is their honour to <HI>put on</HI>
Christ Iesus; other robes you may rob them of,
and giue them occasion to ioy in your purchase.</P>
<P>The third thing reproueable is, <HI>forraine Fashions:</HI>
When we desire nothing more than to bring in some
Outlandish habit different from our owne; in
which respect (so Apishly-anticke is man) it be|comes
more affected than our owne. Against such
the Lord threatneth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zephan. 1.</NOTE> <HI>I will visit the Princes and the
Kings children, and all such as are cloathed with strange
Apparell.</HI> Which <HI>strange Apparell</HI> is after diuers
fashions and inuentions, wholly vnknowne to our
Ancestors. Which may appeare sufficiently to such,
who within this 30, or 40, or 60 yeares neuer saw
such cutting, caruing, nor indenting as they
now see.</P>
<P>The fourth thing reproueable is, <HI>Superfluity of Ap|parell,</HI>
expressed in these three particulars: first, in
those who haue diuers changes and suits of Cloaths;
<PB N="15" REF="31">
who had rather haue their garments eaten by
mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ths, than they should couer the poore members
of Christ. The naked cry, the needy cry, and
shreekingly complaine vnto vs, how they misera|bly
labour and languish of hunger and cold. What
auailes it them that wee haue such changes of ray|ments
neatly plaited and folded; rather than wee
will supply them, they must be starued? How doe
such rich Moath-wormes obserue the Doctrine of
Christ, when he saith in his Gospell; <HI>Hee that hath
two Coats let him giue one to him that hath none?</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, wee are to consider the <HI>Superfluity</HI> of
such who will haue long garments, purposely to
seeme greater: yet, which of these can adde one cu|bit
to his stature? This puts me in remembrance of
a conceited story which I haue sometimes heard, of
a diminutiue Gentleman, who demanding of his
Tayler, what yards of Sattin would make him a
Suite, being answered farre short in number of
what he expected: with great indignation replied,
<Q>Such an one of the <HI>Guard</HI> to my knowledge had
thrice as much for a Suite, and I will second him.</Q>
Which his Tayler with small importunacy conde|scended
to, making a <HI>Gargantn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">'s Suite</HI> for this <HI>Ounce
of mans flesh,</HI> reseruing to himselfe a large portion of
shreads, purposely to forme a fitter proportion for
his <HI>Ganimede</HI> shape.</P>
<P>The third <HI>Superfluity</HI> ariseth from their vanity,
who take delight in wearing great sleeues, misha|pen
Elephantine bodies, traines sweeping the earth,
with huge poakes to shroud their phantasticke
heads, as if they had committed some egregious
fact which deserued that censure: for in the Easterne
Countreyes it hath beene vsually obserued, that such
light Women as had distained their honour, or laid
a publike imputation on their name, by consenting
<PB N="16" REF="32">
to any libidinous act, were to haue their heads
sow'd vp in a poake, to proclaime their shame, and
publish to the world the quality of their sinne.</P>
<P>NOw to insist more punctually on that effemina|tour
both of youth and age,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Delicacy of <HI>Apparell.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Delicacy of Appa|rell;</HI>
I would haue our Daughters of <HI>Albion,</HI> reflect
vpon themselues, those poore shells of corruption:
what a trimming and tricking they bestow on their
brittle houses. <HI>Petrarchs</HI> aduice was, that we should
not be afraid though our out-houses, these structures
of our bodies, were shaken, so our soules, the guests of
our bodies, fared well. Whereas contrariwise, these,
whose onely care is to delude the outward appea|rance
with a seeming faire, so they may preserue the
varnish, disualue the foundation. O may this folly
be a stranger to our Nation! To allay which fury,
at temper which frenzy, I hold no receit more so|ueraigne
than to enter into a serious meditation of
your frailty. As first to consider, what you were be|fore
your birth; secondly, what from your birth to
your death; lastly, what after death. If you reflect
vpon the first, you shall finde that you haue
beene, what before you were not, afterwards were
what now you are not, first made of vile matter (see
the Embleme of humane nature) wrapped in a poore
skinne, nourished in an obscure place, your Coate
the second skinne, till you came to a sight of the
Sunne, which you entertained with a shreek, imply|ing
your originall sinne. Thus attired, thus adorned
came you to vs; what makes you then so vnmind|full
of that poore case wherein you came among vs?
Hath beauty, popular applause, youthfull heate, or
wealth taken from you the knowledge of your
selues? Deriue your pedigree, and blush at your
<PB N="17" REF="32">
matchlesse folly, that pride should so highly magni|fie
it selfe in dust, or glory most in that which brings
with it the most shame. Why doe you walke with
such haughty necks? why doe you extoll your selues
so highly in these Tabernacles of earth? Attend and
consider; you were but vilde corrupted seede at the
first; and now fuller of pollution than at the first.
Entring the world with a shreeke to expresse your
ensuing shame, you became afterwards exposed to
the miseries of this life and to sinne, in the end
wormes and wormes meat shall you be in the graue.
Why then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> you proud, ye dusty shrines, yee ear|then
vessels; seeing your conception was impurity,
birth misery, life penalty, death extremity? Why
doe ye embellish and adorne your flesh with such
port and grace, which within some few dayes
wormes will deuoure in the graue? Meane time you
neglect the incomparable beauty of your soules. For
with what ornaments doe ye adorne them? With
what sweet odors or spirituall graces doe ye perfume
them? With what choyce Flowers of piety and de|uotion
doe ye trim them? What Habits doe ye pre|pare
for them, when they must bee presented before
him who gaue them? How is it that ye so disesteeme
the soule, preferring the flesh before her? For the
Mistresse to play the Handmaid, the Handmaid the
Mistresse, is a great abuse. There can be no successe
in that family, where the houshold is mannaged so
disorderly. O restraine your affections, limit your
desires, beare an equall hand to the better part! The
Building cannot stand vnlesse you remoue the rub|bish
from the foundation. The Soule in the body is
like a Queene in her Palace. If you would then haue
this little Common-wealth within you to flourish,
you must with timely prouidence suppresse all facti|ous
and turbulent molesters of her peace: your pas|sions,
<PB N="18" REF="33">
especially those of vaine-glory, must bee re|strained;
motiues to humility cherished; chast
thoughts embraced; all deuious and wandring Co|gitations
excluded; that the soule may peaceably
enioy her selfe, and in her Palace liue secured. Where|to
if you obiect, that this is an hard lesson; you
cannot despise the world nor hate the flesh; tell mee
where are all those louers of the world, cherishers of
the flesh, which not long since were among vs?
Nothing now remaineth of them but dust and
wormes. Consider diligently (for this considerati|on
will be a Counterpoize to all vaine-glory) what
they now are, and what they haue beene. Women
they were as you are: they haue eat, drunke, laugh|ed,
spent their dayes in iollity, and now in a mo|ment
gone downe to hell. Here their flesh is appor|tioned
to wormes, there their soules appointed to
hell fire: till such time as being gathered together
to that vnhappy society, they shall be rowled in e|ternall
burnings, as they were before partakers with
them in their vices. For one punishment afflicteth,
whom one loue of sinne affecteth. Tell mee, what
profiteth them their vaine-glory, short ioy, world|ly
power, pleasure of the flesh, euill got wealth, a
great family, and concupiscence arising carnally?
Where now is their laughter? Where their iests?
Where their boasting? Where their arrogance?
From so great ioy, how great heauinesse? After such
small pleasure, how great vnhappinesse? From so
great ioy they are now fallen into great wretched|nesse,
grieuous calamity, vnsufferable torments.
What hath befallen them, may befall you: being
Earth of Earth, slime of slime: Of Earth you are, of
Earth you liue, and to Earth you shall returne. Take
this with you for an infallible position in these your
Cottages of Corruption: If you follow the flesh,
<PB N="19" REF="33">
you shall be punished in the flesh: if you be deligh|ted
in the flesh, you shall be tormented in the flesh:
for by how much more your flesh is cockered in this
world with all <HI>delicacy;</HI> by so much more shall your
soules bee tormented in hell eternally. If you seeke
curious and delicate rayments, for the beauty and
brauery of your rayments shall the moath bee laid
vnder you, and your Couering shall bee Wormes.
And this shall suffice to haue beene spoken touching
<HI>Delicacy of Apparell:</HI> we are now to descend briefly
to the second branch, <HI>Superfluity;</HI> whereof we intend
to discourse with that breuity, as the necessity of the
Subiect, whereof wee treat, shall require, and the
generality of this spreading malady may enforce.</P>
<P>DIuine is that saying,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Superfluity of <HI>Apparell.</HI></NOTE> and well worthy your re|tention:
The couetous person before he gaine
loseth himselfe, and before hee take ought is taken
himselfe. He is no lesse wanting to himselfe in that
which hee hath, than in that which hee hath not.
Hee findes that hee lost not, possesseth that hee
owes not, detaines that he ought not, and hates to
restore what hee iniuriously enioyes. So vnbounded
is the affection, or rather so depraued is the auariti|ous
mans inclination, as hee cannot containe his de|sires
within bounds, nor enter parley with reason,
hauing once slaued his <HI>better part</HI> to the soueraignty
of a seruile affection. This may appeare euen in this
one particular. Food and rayment are a Christians
riches: wherein he vseth that moderation, as hee
makes that Apostolicall rule his Christian direction:
<HI>Hauing food and rayment, I haue learned in all things to
be contented.</HI> But how miserably is this golden rule
inuerted, by our sensuall worldling? Competency
must neither be their Cater in the one, nor Conue|niency
<PB N="20" REF="34">
their Tayler in the other. Their Table must
labour of variety of dishes, and their Wardrobe of
exchange of raiments. No reason more probable
than this of their naked insides, which stand in need
of these <HI>superfluous</HI> additaments. What myriads of
indisposed houres consume these in beautifying rot|ten
tombes! How curious they are in suiting their
bodies, how remisse in perferring their soules suit to
their Maker! How much they are disquieted in
their choyce, how much perplexed in their change,
how irresolute what they shall weare, how forgetfull
of what they were! This edging suits not, that pirle
sorts not, this dressing likes not: off it must after
all be fitted, and with a new Exchange, lesse seemely,
but more gaudy suited. The fashion that was in
prime request but yesterday, how it begins to dis|rellish
the wearer, as if it had lost the beauty by vn|seasonable
weather; thus is fashion fallen into a quo|tidian
Feuer: See our compleatest <HI>Fashionmongers,</HI>
how much they tyre themselues with their attiring,
how they trouble themselues with their trimming!
It seemes wonderfull to me, that they are not whol|ly
crushed, with that onerous burthen with which
they are pressed. What a shop of guga nifles hang
vpon one backe? Here the remainder of a greater
worke, the reliques of an ancient Mannor conuerted
to a pearle Chaine. There the moity of an ill-hus|banded
demaine reduced to a Carknet. Long traines
must sweepe away long acres: the Epidemicall va|nity
of this age doth exact it; and shee is held least
worthy affecting, that doth least affect it. What;
sayes my delicate Madam; <Q>Is it for one of my
ranke or descent to affect what is vulgar? how
then should I become popular? I confesse, we are
all composed of one <HI>Earth,</HI> yet is there to bee pre|supposed
a difference in our <HI>birth.</HI> Were it fitting
<PB N="21" REF="34">
that I should fall off, either from that <HI>delicacy</HI>
which is generally approued, or that <HI>variety</HI> which
is by our more generous formalists applauded?
What auailes a mighty fortune to a miserable dis|poser?
Or braue meanes, where a base mind is the
dispenser? <HI>Apparell</HI> must be with <HI>delicacy</HI> sorted,
<HI>variety</HI> suited, or the dignity of the person, be it
neuer so conspicuous, will be obscured. Admit,
variety be meere <HI>superfluity,</HI> at worst it is but the
ages <HI>vanity:</HI> which is such an vniuersall malady, as
it pleads exemption without far<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">r apology.</Q>
Whereto I answer; it is true, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> labours of
this disease: where the eye becomes a determiner
of our worth, by the outward habit which wee
weare: It reflects not on what is in vs, but what is
on vs. She is not to be accounted a Court visitant,
who restraines her selfe either in her choyce of <HI>deli|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">acy,</HI>
or <HI>variety</HI> of habit. What then? Shall a vitious
or effeminate age depraue your iudgement? Or a
corrupt time depriue you of iudgement? No; you
haue more absolute perfections within you, than to
be blemished with these imperfections which you
too frequently carry about you. The more you dis|play
your pye-coloured flagge of vanity; the more
Lures you throw out of loosest liberty; the more fo|ments
you vse of soule-soyling <HI>delicacy;</HI> the deeper
Lodging you bespeake your selues in the Lake of e|ternall
misery. To such I onely speake, who, so they
may furnish themselues of a dainty artist, to teach
them how to <HI>dye</HI> well, make it the least of their care
how to <HI>liue</HI> well. These who loue to dye their <HI>haire,</HI>
but neuer change the dye of their corrupted <HI>heart;</HI>
These will not sticke with frontlesse impudence to
boulster their depraued liberty. They may be, with|out
controule, dispensers and disposers of their owne.
This <HI>variety</HI> and <HI>delicacy</HI> wherein they expresse
<PB N="22" REF="35">
themselues by an especiall marke of distinction from
others, they deriue it from the affluence of their
owne fortunes, and not from others: which being
so iustly enioyed, and without iniury, admits no ex|ception
in all probability. Whereto I reply, with
the words of a Diuine Father,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Basil.</NOTE> <Q>Art not thou,
whosoere thou bee, a Robber, who hast receiued
goods as a Steward or dispenser; and entitlest thy
selfe the impropriator or owner? for what faire

selfe, to gil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> thy shame, or mince thy sinne, it is
the bread of the needy, which thou with-holdest;
the Coat of the naked which in thy Chest thou
storest; the shooes of the barefoot, which with
thee lye rotting; the coyne of the begger, which
with thee lyes moulding.</Q> Away then with these
<HI>Superfluous</HI> dressings; you see daily obiects of your
charity, bring out your wardrobe, and cloath the
naked. That which you so prodigally spent vpon
your selues, conuert it to the more glorious <HI>attiring</HI>
of your naked soules. See that your <HI>Kings daughter</HI>
be all glorious within, that the <HI>King of Kings</HI> may
take pleasure in her. Let not so precious an Image
be defaced, so specious a Virgin defiled, so glorious
a Creature dishonoured. Instead of <HI>Delicacy,</HI> decke
your selues Modestly; instead of <HI>Superfluity,</HI> out of
your variety communicate freely to others necessi|ty.
We are now to descend briefly to the <HI>last branch</HI>
of this <HI>first Obseruation,</HI> declaring, how, That <HI>Appa|rell</HI>
is most comely, which conferres on the <HI>Wearer</HI>

<PB N="23" REF="35">
there is nothing which confers more true glory on
vs, then in displaying our owne Countries garbe
by that we weare vpon vs. The Crowe in the fable
was sharply taxed for her borrowed feathers: The

it be our <HI>custome</HI> to change our <HI>Habit?</HI> With what
constancy some other Nations obserue their natiue

informe vs. Nothing is held more con|temptible
with them, than apishly to imitate foraign

their Tutor. Amongst the ancient Heathen, euen
their very habit distinguish'd Widdowes from Ma|trons,
Matrons from Virgins. So as not onely sexes,
states, conditions, yeeres, but euen linages, races, and

on her own inue~tion, nor compose her selfe to the fa|shion
of any one particular Nation, but make her selfe
an Epitomized confection of all. Thus becomes she
not only a stranger to others, but to her selfe. It were
to be wished, that as our Countrey is iealous of her
owne inuention in contriuing, so shee were no lesse
cautelous in her choice of wearing. <HI>Gregory</HI> the great
thought that <HI>Angles</HI> did neerely symphonize with
<HI>Angels,</HI> not so much in letter, as in fauour and fea|ture:
Were it not pitty that these should darken
their beauty with vailes of deformity? Truth is,
there is nothing which conferres more natiue beau|ty
on the <HI>wearer,</HI> than to be least affectiue in whatso|euer
she shall weare, Shee asperseth a great blemish
on her better part, who tyes her selfe to that forma|lity,
<PB N="24" REF="36">
as she dare not put off the least trifle that shee
weares, nor put on ought more than shee weares,
lest she should lose the opinion of Compleat. There
is a natiue modesty euen in attire as well as gesture,
which better becomes, and would more fully ac|complish
her, if <HI>fashion</HI> were not such a <HI>pearle</HI> in her
eye, as it keepes her from the sight of her owne va|nity.
I confesse, light heads will bee easily taken
with such toyes: yea, I haue sometimes obserued a

Gooseling sooner into a passionate <HI>ah me,</HI> with
a carelesse loue sicke wreathing of his enfolded

one, whom pouerty did enforce to <HI>actions</HI> of such ne|cessity:

<P>THere is nothing which requires more discreti|on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">AFFECTION.</NOTE>
than how to <HI>behaue</HI> or carry our selues while

(saith wise <HI>Plat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>) with <HI>affection</HI> towards his be|loued.
<HI>Reason</HI> is laid asleepe, while <HI>Sense</HI> becomes the
master Wooer. Whence came that vsuall saying,
<HI>One cannot loue and be wise.</HI> But I wholly oppose my
selfe to their assertion, who seeme thus farre trans|ported
with the sensuall opinion of <HI>affection.</HI> My Te|net
is, <HI>One cannot truely loue, and not be wise.</HI> It is a
Beldam frenzy and no fancy, which giues way to fu|ry,
and admits not reason to haue soueraignty. Yet
in this Subiect, <HI>Gentlewomen,</HI> is your temper best
tryed, your discretion most required, and your Pa|tience,
oft-times, most exercised. Looke therefore
how you plant it, lest you bootlesly repent it, when
it is misplaced.</P>
<P>It is most certaine, there is nothing more impa|tient
of delay than loue, nor no wound more incu|rable
while we liue. There is no exemption, all haue
a taste of this Potion, though it haue seuerall degrees
of operation.
<Q><L>Looke all about you; who so young that loues not?</L>
<L>Or who so old, a comely feature moues not?</L></Q></P>
<P>Yet what different passions arise from one and the
selfe-same Subiect? Heere, <HI>Gentlewomen,</HI> you shall
see some of your Sexe so surprized with <HI>affection,</HI> as
<PB N="33" REF="40">
it bursts out into violent extremes;<NOTE PLACE="marg">BEHAVIOR</NOTE> their discourse
is semi-breu'd with sighes, their talke with teares;
they walke desperately forlorne, making Launds and
desolate Groues their disconso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ate Consorts. Their
eyes are estrang'd from sleepe, their weakened ap|petite
from repast, their wearied limbs from repose.
Melancholly is their sole melody; They haue made
a Contract with griefe, till griefe bring them to
their graue. And these poore wenches are much to
be pittied, because their owne tender hearts brought
them to this exigent; hauing either set their <HI>affecti|ons,</HI>
where they thought verily they might bee re|quited
and were not, or else where they receiued
like seeming tender of <HI>affection,</HI> but afterwards reie|cted,
what they wished to effect they could not. So
as, in time, if continuance of absence reduce them
not to a better temper, they fall into a poore <HI>Maud|lins</HI>
distemper, by giuing raines to passion, till it e|strange
them from the soueraignty of reason. Where|as
others you shall see, though not such kind soules,
nor halfe so passionate, yet more discreet in their
Choyce, and in the passages of loue more tempe|rate.
These will not deigne to cast a loose looke vpon
their beloued: but stand so punctually vpon their
termes, as if they stood indifferent for their choyce,
albeit constantly resolued neuer to admit of any
change. These scorne to paint out their passions in
plaints, or vtter their thoughts in sighes, or shed
one dispassionate teare for an incompassionate Louer.
Their Experience hath taught them better Notions:
they wil seemingly fly to make them follow, and so
take them by whom they are most taken. They can
play with the flame, and neuer cinge their wings;
looke loue in the face, and preserue their eyes; con|uerse
where they take delight, and colour their <HI>af|fection</HI>
with a seeming disdaine. These are they who
<PB N="34" REF="41">
can walke in the Clouds to their intimatest friends:
make their eyes strangers to their hearts, and con|clude;
nothing more foolish than Loue, if discoue|red;
nothing more wise, if artfully shadowed. But
I neither approue the <HI>violence</HI> of the former, nor <HI>in|difference</HI>
of the latter. The one interlayeth <HI>affection</HI>
with too much passion, the other with too much
dissimulation. These were well to bee so allayed or
attempered, as neither too much eagernesse taxe
the discretion, nor too much remisnesse argue coole|nesse
of <HI>affection.</HI> For the former, I must tell them
they giue great aduantage to an insulting Louer, to'
entertaine Loue with such vehement ardour: it fares
with these, as with hot <HI>duellists,</HI> who fight them|selues
out of breath, and so subiect their relenting
<HI>force</HI> to the command of a better tempered enemy.
For the latter, they hold constantly that position in
arguments of <HI>Loue,</HI> as well as in other actions of
their <HI>life;</HI> She knowes not how to <HI>liue,</HI> nor how to
<HI>loue,</HI> that knowes not how to dissemble. I must tell
these, <HI>Dissimulation</HI> sorts not well with <HI>affection:</HI> Lo|uers
seldome read Loues Polliticks. Let them ap|peare
what they are with that discreet temper, as
they may deserue the embraces of a Noble Louer.
In briefe, let such as are too hot in the quest of their
desires, attemperate that heat with intermissions:
such violence is best rebated by absence. Contrari|wise,
such as are too coole, let them quicken that ea|sinesse
with their more frequent conference, and assi|duate
presence.</P>
<P>VVHat a furious and inconsiderate thing is
<HI>Woman,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PASSION</NOTE> when Passion distempers her? how
much is her <HI>Behauiour</HI> altered, as if <HI>Iocasta</HI> were
now to be per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">onated? True it is, some with a bite
<PB N="35" REF="41">
of their lip, can snppresse an intended reuenge: and
like dangerous Politicians, pleasingly entertaine
time with one they mortally hate, till oportunity
vsher reuenge, which they can act with as much
hostility, as if that very moment were the Actor of
their iniury. But this <HI>Passion</HI> neuer workes more
tragicke of fearefull effects, than when it streames
from Iealousie or Competition in the Subiect where
they loue. Whereof wee haue variety of instances
euen in our owne Iland, to omit <HI>Italy,</HI> which is a ve|ry
Theatre of Tragicke Conclusions in this kinde. It
is not long since we had one matchlesse President of
this stampe. <Q>It sometimes pleased a young <HI>Gen|tlewoman,</HI>
whose fortunes had swell'd her high, to
settle her affection on a <HI>Gentleman</HI> of deseruing
parts, which he entertained with a generous re|quitall:
nothing was omitted that might any way
increase this respect, or second the height of their
ioyes. Continuall resort and frequent made them
inseparably one: No day so pleasing, as when they
were together; No houre so tedious as when they
were asunder. But how short is that moment of
vading happinesse, which hath in it a rellish of
lightnesse, and is not grounded on essentiall good|nesse!
Long had they not thus liued, and sociably
loued, but the <HI>Gentlewoman</HI> conceiued some pri|uate
suspition, that her selfe was not sole soue|raignesse
of his heart, but that another was become
sharer in his loue. Neither was this Competitrice,
whom shee suspected, any other than her owne at|tendant,
whose Caskets shee secretly opened,
where she found a Ring of especiall note, which
shee had formerly bestowed on him. This confir|med
her Conceit, changed her reall loue into
mortall hate; which shee seconded with this tra|gicke
act: Inuiting him one day to a Summer Ar|bour,
<PB N="36" REF="42">
where in former times they were vsually
wont to repose, amidst of an amorous discourse,
she <HI>casually</HI> fixt her eye vpon three <HI>Lennets,</HI> one
whereof picking some priuet leaues purposely to
build her neast, flew away, while the two which
remained, louingly billed one with another: which
she intentiuely obseruing, vsed these words; <HI>How
tenderly and intimately doe those poore fooles mate it?
Were it not pitty they should euer be diuided?</HI> Which
words she had no sooner vttered, then the <HI>Shee-Lennet</HI>
flew away, and left the Male alone, till an|other
returned: with whom the <HI>Hee-Lennet</HI> bil|led,
and amorously wooed as hee had done before.
Which shee more seriously eying, <HI>O,</HI> quoth shee,
<HI>How light these males are in their affection! This may
seem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> to you an easie error, but were I Iudge of Birds, it
should receiue due censure. Why Lady</HI> (replyed hee)
<HI>These poore Birds doe but according to their kinde. Yea,
but what doe ye kind men then, who ingage your loues,
interest your selues, empawne your soules to bee constant
where you professe loue, and performe nothing lesse than
what you professe most.</HI> Nor would her long intended
reuenge admit more liberty to her tongue; for
with a passionate enterbreath shee clozed this
speech with a fatall stabbe: leauing so much time
to her vnfortunate and disasterous Louer, as to dis|couer
to one of that sorrowfull family the ground
of her hate, the occasion of his fall, which hastned
on the dolefull Scene of her Tragedy.</Q> Now to al|lay
or abate these passionate furies, there is no better
meanes than to enter parley with reason; to chastise
all such innouating motions as disquiet the inward
repose of the mind; to vse the helpe of such whole|some
instructions, as may attemper the heat of those
indisposed and inordinate passions. Anger, being an
inflammation of blood about the heart, is such a fu|ry,
<PB N="37" REF="42">
as to giue way to it, is to disclaime reason: much
wisedome is then required, mature aduice to bee v|sed,
all assistants of <HI>Art</HI> and <HI>Nature</HI> to be employed
before this <HI>Adder</HI> can be charmed. For wee shall
hardly see any one more forget themselues, than
when they are surprized with this <HI>Passion.</HI> Some you
shall obserue so amazed or entranced, as they become
wholly silenced: They cannot vtter an articulate
word to gaine a kingdome. Gladly would they ex|presse
their distaste, and menace reuenge, if their
tongues would giue them leaue, but wrath hath tyed
them to <HI>good behauiour.</HI> Others are so voluble of
tongue, as nothing can passe them vntouch'd, to a|sperse
disgrace on such by whom they hold them|selues
wrong'd. If any infamy (which to that time
lay buried) offer it selfe to their memory, how they
ioy in the occasion of venting their malice on their
persons, be their Calumny seconded with words of
fowlest aspersion: Which sort of people the euerli|uing
<HI>Pindarus</HI> termes persons of vnbounded and vn|brideled
tongues. To remedy which enormities,
take along with you these instructions: they will be|nefit
you much in the height and heat of your anger,
and allay your <HI>passion</HI> when it rageth and riseth into
hugest distemper. Forthwith, so soone as you shall
perceiue your selues moued, restraine your passion;
but if you cannot appease nor compose your inward
Commotion, at least restraine your tongue, and in|ioyne
it silence, that if it speake no good, it may
speake no euill, lest being loose and set at liberty, it
vtter what <HI>wrath,</HI> and not <HI>reason</HI> dictates: More so|ueraigne
and peacefull it will bee for you to retire
from society, make recourse to your Oratory, by re|commending
to your best Physician the cure of this
infirmity. Vse likewise this Cordial salue to your cor|roding
soare; the receit is Diuine, if seasonably ap|plyed,
<PB N="38" REF="43">
and will minister you comfort when you are
most distempered. So soone as your disquieted minds
begin to expostulate with the quality of your
wrongs, which your Enemy is apt to aggrauate and
exasperate, purposely to hasten your precipitate re|uenge;
propose and set before you all the disgraces
which possibly you can suffer, and conferre them
with those that were aspersed on your Sauiour: this
will prepare you to suffer, teach you to conquer: for
Arrowes foreseene menace lesse danger.</P>
<P>Likewise, when you consider the iniuries which
are done you by others, you may reflect vpon the
wrongs which are done by you vnto others: for
the consideration of your owne infirmity, will ex|act
of you towards others an impunity. Weigh with
your selues how much others suffer of you, how
much God himselfe suffers of you, who, if he should
haue inflicted reuenge for euery particular offence,
you should haue perished long since. In a word, you
your selues are frequently grieuous, and displeasing
to your selues: Seeing then you are so distastefull vn|to
your selues, as you must of necessity suffer many in|iuries
and affronts from your selues, repine not at the
sufferings which are inflicted by others on our selues.</P>
<P>You are likewise to consider these discommodi|ties
which arise from this <HI>Passion;</HI> which will arme
you with patience, if of your selues you haue any
compassion. What auailes it to be reuenged, after our
iniury be r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ceiued? Is your wou~d by anothers wound
to be cured? Or disgrace tendred, by rendring
disgrace restored? Besides all this, see what hee
obtaineth, who <HI>anger</HI> obeyeth: 1. He is depriued of
the Crowne of glory, and reward of eternity: 2. He
becomes a Minister and Instrument of the Deuill:
3. He destroyeth his owne soule, that he might hurt
an others body:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Greg.</NOTE> For a dispassionate or angry person
<PB N="39" REF="43">
is like vnto him, who that he may kill his Asse, de|stroyeth
himselfe; or rather like him, who for huge
debts which he is not able to discharge, is throwne
into prison, and disdainefully refuseth any ones offer
to pay his debt for him. For by him, who doth you
wrong, is the debt which you owe to God, forgiuen,
if with patience you suffer the iniury which is done.
Whereas the angry person, who will bee his owne
reuenger, telleth God how and in what sort he is to
deale with him: that as he suffered not small disgra|ces
from another, so neither should small things be
suffered in him by God. As it is written, <HI>With what
measure you mete, the same shall be measured to you againe.</HI>
Six other detriments or discommodities there bee
which arise from the exorbitancy of this passion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. lib. 5.</NOTE>
For by Anger is lost;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Moral&punc; cap. 31.</NOTE> first, <HI>Wisedome,</HI> while reason
becomes blinded. Secondly, <HI>Righteousnesse:</HI> for <HI>the
wrath of man worketh not the righteousnesse of God.</HI>
Thirdly, <HI>Society,</HI> for the Acquaintance of one angry
man, is pleasing vnto none. <HI>Be not,</HI> saith the Wise|man,
<HI>a companion with the angry man.</HI> Fourthly, <HI>Con|cord:</HI>
while peace is disturbed. Fifthly, the <HI>Light of
Truth,</HI> because anger casteth the darkenesse of con|fusion
vpon the mind or vnderstanding, from whom
God hideth the cheerefull beame of his Diuine
knowledge. Sixthly, the <HI>Splendor of the holy spirit: vp|on
whom,</HI> saith the Prophet, <HI>shall my spirit rest, but vp|on
the humble and quiet?</HI> that is, vpon the meeke,
mild, and compassionate.</P>
<P>Thus you see what benefits may bee procured by
attempering what discommodities incurred by fo|string
this <HI>Passion.</HI> Whereon I haue the rather insi|sted,
because I am not ignorant, how the strongest
and constantest tempers haue beene, and may be di|stempered
and disparraged by it; much more you,
wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e mainest strength consists in the expression of
<PB N="40" REF="44">
that <HI>Passion.</HI> At all times therefore vse a moderate re|straint;
in the prime of your yeares, when youth
sends forth her first promising blossomes, <HI>behaue</HI>
your selues mildly without bitternesse, humbly
without haughtinesse, modestly without lightnesse,
soberly without childishnesse. The Caske will re|taine
her first taste; the Wooll her first dye. If you
shew too much way wardnesse in your youth, small
good is to be expected in your age. As you tender
your preferrement, seeme milde while you are
maids, lest you proue scare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">crowes to a young mans
bed. Conforme your selues likewise to a nuptiall
State, and preserue your honour without staine. Con|test
not with your <HI>head</HI> for preeminence: you came
from him, not he from you, honour him then as he
cherisheth the loue he conceiues in you. A domestick
fury makes ill harmony in any family. The discord
which was hatched and increased towards <HI>M. An|thony</HI>
by <HI>Fulu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">a,</HI> was euer allayed and attempered by
the moderation of <HI>Octauia.</HI> Be you all <HI>Octauia's;</HI> the
rougher your crosse, the richer your Crowne. The
more that iniuries presse you, the more shall your pa|tience
praise you. The Conflict is but short and mo|mentanie,
the Triumph glorious and impa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">l'd with
eternity. And thus much touching those three par|ticulars,
whereon your <HI>Behauior</HI> principally reflects;
wee are now to descend to the next branch, which
shall shew how a <HI>Gentlewoman</HI> of ranke and quality,
(for to such onely is my discourse directed) is to <HI>be|haue
her selfe in Company.</HI></P>
<P><HI>SOciety</HI> is the solace of the liuing, for to liue with|out
it, were a kinde of dying. Companions and
friendly Associats are the <HI>Theeues</HI> of time. No houre
can be so tedious, which two louing Consorts can|not
<PB N="41" REF="44">
passe ouer with delight, and spend without dis|taste.
Be the night neuer so darke, the place neuer
so meane, the cheerefull beames of conceiuing con|sorts
will enlighten the one, and their affections mu|tually
planted, enliuen the other. What a Desert then
were the world without friends? and how poselesse
those friends without conceiuing mindes? and how
weake those mindes, vnlesse vnited in equall bonds?
So then, loue is the Cement of our life: life a load
without loue. Now, <HI>Gentlewomen,</HI> you are to put on
your vailes, and goe into <HI>Company.</HI> Which (I am
perswaded) you cannot enter without a maiden|blush,
a modest tincture. Herein you are to be most
cautelous, seeing no place can be more mortally dan|gerous.
Beware therefore with whom you consort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How to <HI>be|haue</HI> her selfe in <HI>Company.</HI></NOTE>
as you tender your repute: for report will brute
what you are, by the Company which you beare.
<HI>Augustus</HI> being at a combat, discerned the inclinati|ons
of his two daughters, <HI>Iulia</HI> and <HI>Liuia,</HI> by the
Company which frequented them: for graue Senators
talked with <HI>Liuia,</HI> but riotous persons with <HI>Iulia.</HI>
Would you preserue those precious odors of your
good names? Consort with such whose names were
neuer branded, conuerse with such, whose tongues
for immodesty were neuer taxed. As by good words
euill manners are corrected, so by euill words are
good ones corrupted. Make no reside there, where
the least occasion of lightnesse is ministred; auert
your Eare when you heare it, but your heart especi|ally,
lest you harbour it. To enter into much dis|course
or familiarity with strangers, argues light|nesse
or indiscretion: what is spoken of Maids, may
be properly applyed by an vsefull consequence to all
women: <HI>They should be seene, and not heard:</HI> A Tra|ueller
sets himselfe best out by discourse, whereas
their best setting out is silence. You shall haue ma|ny
<PB N="42" REF="45">
trifling questions asked, as much to purpose as if
they said nothing: but a friuolous question deserues
to be resolu'd by silence. For your <HI>Carriage,</HI> it should
neither <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e too precise, nor too loose. These sempring
made fac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s partake more of <HI>Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">mbermaid</HI> than <HI>Gen|tlewoman.</HI>
Modesty and mildnesse hold sweetest cor|respondence.
You may possibly be wooed to inter|change
fauours: Rings or Ribonds are but trifles;
yet trust me, they are no trifles that are aym'd at in
those exchanges. Let nothing passe from you, that
may any way impeach you, or giue others aduan|tage
ouer you. Your innocent credulity (I am resol|ued)
is as free from conceit of ill, as theirs, per|haps,
from intendment of good: but these inter|courses
of Courtesies are not to be admitted, lest by
this familiarity, an Entry to affection bee opened,
which before was closed. It is dangerous to enter
parley with a beleagring enemy: it implyes want
or weakenesse in the besieged. Chastity is an <HI>inclosed
Garden,</HI> it should not be so much as assaulted, lest the
report of her spotlesse beauty become soyled. Such
Forts hold out best, which hold themselues least se|cure,
when they are securest. <HI>Nasica,</HI> when the <HI>Ro|man</HI>
Common-wealth was supposed to bee in most
secure estate, because freed of their enemies, and
strongly fenced by their friends, affirmed that
though the <HI>Achaians</HI> and <HI>Carthaginians</HI> were both
brought vnder the yoke of bondage, yet they were
most in danger, because none were left, whom they
might either feare for danger, or who should keepe
them in awe.</P>
<P>How subiect poore <HI>Women</HI> be to lapses, and recidi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ions,
being left their owne Guardians, daily ex|perience
can sufficiently discouer. Of which num|ber,
those alwayes proued weakest, who were con|fidentest
of their owne strength. Presumption is a
<PB N="43" REF="45">
daring sinne, and euer brings out some vntimely
birth, which viper-like depriues her vnhappy pa|rent
of life. I haue knowne diuers so resolute in their
vndertakings, so presuming of their womanish
strength, so constantly deuoted to a single life, as in
publike consorts they held it their choycest merri|ment
to giue loue the affront, to discourse of affe|ction
with an imperious contempt, geere their a|morous
suiters out of Count'nance, and make a very
<HI>Whirligig</HI> of loue. But marke the conclusion of these
insulting spirits: they sport so long with loue, till
they fall to loue in earnest. A moment makes them
of Soueraigns Captiues, by slauing them to that de|seruedly,
which at first they entertained so disdain|fully.
The way then to preuent this malady, is to
weane you from consorting with folly. What an
excellent impregnable fortresse were <HI>Woman,</HI> did
not her <HI>Windowes</HI> betray her to her enemy? But
principally, when shee leaues her Chamber to walke
on the publike Theatre; when shee throwes off her
vaile, and giues attention to a merry tale; when she
consorts with youthfull bloud, and either enters par|ley,
or admits of an enter-view with loue. It is most
true what the sententious moral somtimes obserued:
We may be in <HI>security,</HI> so long as we are sequestred
from <HI>society.</HI> Then, and neuer till then, begins the
<HI>infection</HI> to be dispersed, when the sound and sicke be|gin
to be promiscuously mixed. Tempt not Chastity;
hazard not your Christian liberty. You shall encoun|ter
with many forward youths, who will most pun|ctually
tender their vselesse seruice to your sha|dowes
at the very first sight: doe not admit them,
lest you prostitute your selues to their prostrate ser|uice.

What a serious intercourse or sociable dialogue is

The poynt or pendent of her feather wags

<P>Deuout mention is made of zealous <HI>Anna,</HI> who
made recourse to the Temple, offring her incessant
prayers, a viall of sweet odours, that she might con|ceiue
a sonne: of whom, to her succeeding memory,
the Scripture recordeth, that after her teares so de|uoutly
shed, her prayers so sincerely offred, her re|ligious
vowes so faithfully performed, her counte|nance
<PB N="46" REF="47">
was no more altred; Piety begot in her diuine
loue, faith in Gods promise made her beleeue, and
zeale to Gods house caused her to perseuere: thus
sighing she sought, seeking she obtained, and obtai|ning
she retained a gratefull memory of what she re|ceiued.
No lesse feruour shewed <HI>Ester</HI> in preferring
the suite of her distressed <HI>Israelites;</HI> what perswa|siue
Oratory, what powerfull Rhetoricke, what in|ducing
reaso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s she vsed, to haue their vniust censure
reuersed, their insupportable wrongs redressed, their
agrieuances relieued, the incensed King appeased,
and them to fauour restored? Shee wooed with
teares in her eyes, faith in her heart, almes in her
hand; Gods cause was the progresse of her course;
shee desired nothing more then how to effect it,
which was seconded with a successiue conclusion, be|cause
begun, continued, and ended with deuotion.
The like zeale expressed <HI>Iudith</HI> for her besiedged <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|thulites;</HI>
the loue of God had so inflamed her, as no
feare of the enemy could amate her; faith armed her
with resolution; constancy strengthned her against
all opposition. Her armour was prayer, <HI>Bethulia's</HI>
cure her care; holy desires her sole attendants; she
enters her enemies pauilion with a zealous confi|dence;
implores the Diuine assistance in her entrance;
and discomfits a <HI>daring</HI> foe with cautelous silence. Her
sighes and teares were as the <HI>first</HI> and <HI>second raine;</HI>
they brought successe to her thirsty soule, and a glo|rious
Conquest to her natiue soyle. No lesse are we
to admire the wonderfull deuotion of that teare-swollen
<HI>Magdelen,</HI> who with deuout loue sought
her deare Spouse intombed, whose body with obse|quious
Odours she had embalmed before euer he

But obserue the comfortable effect of her ef|fectuall
loue! For as much as shee loued more than
the rest, and louing wept more than the rest, and
weeping sought more than the rest, and seeking per|seuer'd,
allowing her selfe no rest: therefore deserued

bickring and embattailing with the <HI>Leader</HI> of

Enemies are euer lying in ambuscado for
you; how many soule-tempting <HI>Syrens</HI> are warbling
notes of ruine to delude you; what <HI>feares</HI> within you,
what <HI>foes</HI> without you, what <HI>furies</HI> all about you;
you would not suffer one graine of sand to drop

Make then your Chamber your priuate

to Gods honour. Be <HI>still</HI> from the world, but <HI>stir|ring</HI>
towards God. Meditation, let it be your compa|nion.
It is the perfume of the memory; the soules

of choyce and delicious viands, to discourse of
vanity, and suffer himselfe to famish in the presence
of such plenty? This is your case, if amidst so many
soule-solacing dainties of spirituall comforts, you
diuert your eye, by fixing it on these Obiects of
earth: and repose not your selues in those fragrant
borders of Diuine Contemplation; which, by how
much they are more frequent, by so much they be|come
more sweet and redolent. Surely, there is no|thing
that relisheth more sweetly, tasteth more
daintily, with-draweth your mindes from the

world more speedily, strengtheneth you against the
temptations of your enemy, excites or exerciseth
you in euery spirituall duty, as the soule-rauishing
<HI>Contemplation</HI> of the Supreme Deity. All other Ob|iects
are vanity. They may play vpon your fantasie,
and so delude you; but being weakely grounded on
pitty, they can neuer suffice you. Taske your selues
then priuately, lest <HI>priuacy</HI> become your enemy. As
mans extremity is Gods oportunity, so the Deuils
oportunity is mans security. Let not a minute bee
mis-spended, lest security become your attendant.
Be it in the exercise of your Needle, or any other
manuall employment: attemper that labour with
some sweet meditation tending to Gods honour.
Chuse rather with <HI>Penelope</HI> to weaue and vnweaue,
than to giue Idlenesse the least leaue: Wanton
Wooers are time-wasters. They make you idolize
your selues, and consequently hazardize the state of
your soules. Let not their <HI>Lip-salue</HI> so annoynt you,
as it make you forgetfull of him that made you. Be
you in your Chambers or priuate Closets; be you
retired from the eyes of men; thinke how the eyes
of God are on you. Doe not say, the walls encom|passe
mee, darkenesse o're-shadowes mee, the Cur|taine
of night secures me: These be the words of an
<HI>Adulteresse:</HI> Therefore doe nothing <HI>priuately,</HI> which
you would not doe <HI>publikely.</HI> There is no retire from
the eyes of God. I haue heard of some, who for want
of more amorous or attractiue Obiects abroad, haue
furnished their priuate Chambers with wanton
pictures, <HI>Aretine</HI> tables, <HI>Sibariticke</HI> stories. These
were no obiects for Christian eyes: they conuay too
inordinate an heat from the eye to the heart. Eye
no obiect which may estrange you from thought of
your Maker. Make euery day your <HI>Ephemerides.</HI> Let
your morning imitate your purposes for the day, the

purchase. And so I descend to the next branch: how
you are to <HI>behaue</HI> your selues in <HI>publike,</HI> which should
be by so much more punctuall, for as much as the
world is more Stoicall.</P>
<P>VVOmen in sundry Countryes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This branch might seeme included in our former discourse of <HI>Company;</HI> but that reflected on <HI>persons,</HI> this on <HI>af|faires.</HI></NOTE> when they
goe into any <HI>publike</HI> concourse or presse of
people, vse to weare vayles, to imply that secret in|screened
beauty which best becomes a <HI>Woman, Bash|full
modesty.</HI> Which habit our owne Nation now in
latter yeares hath obserued: which, howsoeuer the
intention of the wearer appeare, deserues approue|ment:
because it expresseth in it selfe <HI>Modest shame|fastnesse,</HI>
a Womans chiefest Ornament. I second his
opinion, who held it for diuers maine respects, a
custome very irregular and vndecent, that <HI>Women</HI>
should frequent places of <HI>publike</HI> resort, as Stage-playes,
Wakes, solemne Feasts, and the like. It is
<HI>Occasion</HI> that depraues vs; <HI>Company</HI> that corrupts vs.
Hence it was, that some flourishing States, hauing
eyed the inconueniences which arise from the vsuall
resort of <HI>Women</HI> to Enterludes and other <HI>publike</HI> So|lemnities,
published an expresse inhibition against
such free and frequent meetings. Had <HI>Hippodamia</HI>
neuer wandred, shee had prou'd an <HI>Hypemnestra,</HI> and
had neuer wantoned. Had <HI>Dinah</HI> neuer roaued, shee
had prou'd a <HI>Diana,</HI> and had neuer beene rauished.
Yet farre be it from me, to be so regularly strict, or
<HI>Laconically</HI> seuere, as to exclude <HI>Wom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">n</HI> from all <HI>pub|like</HI>
societies. Meetings they may haue, and im|proue
them, by a Ciuill and Morall vse of them, to
their benefit. They may chat and conuerse with a
modest freedome, so they doe not gossip it. For
<PB N="51" REF="49">
these <HI>Shee-Elpenors,</HI> and <HI>Feminine Epicures,</HI> who sur|fet
out their time in an vnwomanly excesse, we ex|clude
them the pale of our Common-weale. Be
they of what <HI>state</HI> soeuer, they are staines to their
<HI>Sexe</HI> for euer. Especially such, who carouse it in
deepe healths, reioyce at the colour of the wine, till
it sparkle in their veines, inflame their bloods, and
lay open a breach to the frailty of their Sexe. For
preuention whereof, we reade that kinsmen kissed
their kinswomen to know whether they drunke
wine or no, and if they had, to bee punished by
death, or banished into some Iland. <HI>Plutarch</HI> saith,
that if the Matrons had any necessity to drinke wine,
either because they were sicke or weake; the Senate
was to giue them licence, and not then in <HI>Rome</HI> nei|ther,
but out of the City.</P>
<P><HI>Macrobius</HI> saith, that there were two Senators in
<HI>Rome</HI> chiding, and the one called the others wife
an Adulteresse, and the other his wife a Drun|kard;
and it was iudged, that to be a drunkard was
more infamy. Truth is, they might ioyne hands as
mates of one society, for I haue seldome seene any
one subiect to Ebriety, preserue long vntainted the
honour of their chastity.</P>
<P>Now for <HI>publike</HI> Employments, I know all are
not borne to be <HI>Deborahs,</HI> to beare virile spirits in
feminine bodies. Yet, in <HI>chusing the better part,</HI> you
may fit and accommodate your persons to <HI>publike
affaires,</HI> well sorting and suting with your ranke and
quality. <HI>Claudia</HI> and <HI>Priscilla</HI> were nobly descended,
yet they <HI>publikely</HI> resorted, where they might be re|ligiously
instructed; and no lesse <HI>publikely</HI> instructed
others in those principles wherein they were infor|med.
It is said of the <HI>Vestall Virgins,</HI> that they first
learned what to doe; secondly, they did what they
had learned; thirdly, they instructed others to doe
<PB N="52" REF="50">
that which they had both done and learned. For
this, the rich <HI>Saban Queene</HI> left her owne Region to
heare the Wisdome of King <HI>Salomon.</HI> Surely, how|soeuer
some, no lesse properly than pregnantly, haue
emblematiz'd <HI>Woman</HI> by a <HI>Snayle:</HI> because shee still
carries her house about her, as is the property of a
good House-keeper; yet in my iudgement (where|in
I ingenuously submit to others censure) a modest
and well <HI>Behaued Woman</HI> may by her frequent or re|sort
to <HI>publike</HI> places, conferre no lesse benefit to such
as obserue her <HI>behauiour,</HI> than occasion of profit to
her priu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">te family, where shee is <HI>Ouerseer.</HI> I haue
seene some in these places of <HI>publike repaire,</HI> expresse
such a well-seeming State without Apish formality,
as euery action deserued imitation of such as were in
their Company. Their Conceits were sweetly
tempered without lightnesse; their iests sauory, yet
without saltnesse; their discourse free without
nicenesse; their answers milde without tartnes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e;
their smile pleasing, mixt with bashfulnesse; their
pace gracefull without too much actiuenesse; their
whole posture delightfull with a seemely careles|nesse.
These are such mirrors of modesty, patternes
of piety, as they would not for a world transgresse
the bounds of Ciuility. These are Matrons in their
houses, Models in <HI>publike</HI> places. <HI>Words spoken in sea|son,
are like apples of gold with pictures of siluer:</HI> So
oportunat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ly are their words deliuered, so seasona|bly
vttered, with such vnaffected eloquence expres|sed,
wheresoeuer this sweet and well-tempered dis|cretion
is seated. Whereas others there be, whose
indiscretion makes discouery of an Ocean of words,
out a drop of reason. They speake much, but ex|pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">sse
little; their conceits are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">uer ballased with
harshnesse; their iests <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">oisted in with too much dul|nesse;
their discourse trimmed vp with too much

nea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nesse; their answers leauened with too much

or vnlo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">iable peruersenesse; their pace either
too q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">icke or too slow in dispatch of businesse; their
whole posture an indisposed frame of irregular ab|surdities.
But to draw in our sayles, touching the
prosecution of this branch; our reproofe shall re|flect
vpon two sorts especially, whose deuious course
drawne by an indirect line, may seeme to deserue re|prehension
worthily. The <HI>first</HI> are such, who giue
too easie raines to liberty; making <HI>Pleasure</HI> their
<HI>Vocation:</HI> as if they were created for no other end,
than to dedicate the first fruits of the day to their
<HI>Glasse;</HI> the residue to the <HI>Stage</HI> or <HI>Exchange.</HI> These,
no sooner haue they layd their <HI>Artificiall Complexion</HI>
on their adulterate faces, than they grow sicke for
their Coach. They must visit such a Lady, or what,
perchance, is worse, such a Lord. A minute now
in their Chambers seemes a moneth. Shall wee
display one of these in her colours? The <HI>Play-bills</HI>
must be brought her by her <HI>Pentioner:</HI> her eye views
and reuiewes, and out of her feminine iudgement
culls out one from among them which shee will see,
purposely to be seene. Much shee obserues not in it,
onely she desires to be obserued at it. Her <HI>Behauiour</HI>
in a <HI>Box,</HI> would make any one thinke shee were a
Bee in a box; shee makes such a buzzing and rusling.
This is her daily taske, till death enter the Stage and
play his part; whom shee entertaines with such
vnpreparednesse, as her <HI>extreme act</HI> presents obiects
of infinite vnhappinesse: <Q>As it sometimes fared
with a Gentlewoman of our owne Nation, who so
daily bestowed the expence of her best houres vp|on
the Stage, as being surprized by sicknesse, euen
vnto death, she became so deafe to such as admoni|shed
her of her end, as shee clozed her <HI>dying scene</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="51">
with a vehement calling on <HI>Hieronim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI></Q> So inap|prehensiue
was shee of death at her end, because she
neuer meditated of death before her end. Now for
the <HI>second sort,</HI> they are meere <HI>Antipodes</HI> to the for|mer;
These are onely for <HI>profit,</HI> as the other were for
<HI>pleasure.</HI> These become so wedded to the world, as
they afflict their spirits, macerate their bodies, e|strange
themselues from offices of Neighbourhood,
to improue their reuenewes, by discouering their
too much prouidence to the world. And these are
commonly such, as are matcht to Schollers, whose
contemplation hath taken them from the world, and
recommended the mannagement of their estate to
their wife. Now to both these sorts let me addresse
my instruction: As I could not possibly approue of
the <HI>former,</HI> because they made <HI>pleasure</HI> their <HI>businesse:</HI>
so I cannot commend these, because they make not
their <HI>businesse</HI> a <HI>pleasure.</HI> Let these take heed, that
they incurre not that miserable insensibility, which
I haue heard sometimes befell to a World<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ing of
their sexe: <Q>Who approaching neere her hauen,
and entring now her last Conflict with Nature,
was, by such as stood about her, earnestly moued
<HI>to recommend her selfe to God, tender the welfare of her
soule, and to make her saluation sure;</HI> thus briefly, but
fearefully answered, and forthwith departed: <HI>I haue
made it as sure as Law will make it.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Done Ti|moris.</NOTE> Or as we read in
a booke entituled <HI>The Gift of feare,</HI> how a Religious
Diuine comming to a certaine Vsuresse, to aduise
her of the state of her soule, and instruct her in
the way to saluation, at such time as shee lay lan|guishing
in her bed of affliction; told her, how
there were three thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">gs by her to bee necessarily
performed, if euer shee hoped to be saued: First,
she was to be <HI>contrite</HI> in heart; secondly, shee was
to <HI>confesse</HI> her sinnes; thirdly, shee was to make
<PB N="55" REF="51">
<HI>restitution</HI> according to her meanes. Whereto shee
thus replyed; <HI>Two of those first I will doe willingly:
but to doe the last, I shall hold it a difficulty; for should
I make restitution, what would remain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> to raise my chil|dren
their portion?</HI> To which the Diuine answered;
<HI>Without these three you cannot be saued. Yea but,</HI> quoth
shee, <HI>Doe our Learned men and Scriptures say so?
Ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> surely,</HI> said the Diuine. <HI>And I will try</HI> (quoth
she) <HI>whether they say true or no, for I will restore no|thing.</HI></Q>
And so resoluing, fearefully dyed, fearing
pouerty temporall, more than eternall, which shee
was of necessity to suffer, (without Gods infinite in|terceding
mercy) for preferring the care of her po|sterity,
before the honour of her Maker.</P>
<P>To be short, the <HI>former sort</HI> deserues reproofe, for
making <HI>pleasure</HI> their <HI>vocation;</HI> the <HI>latter</HI> for barring
<HI>businesse</HI> all <HI>recreation.</HI> A discreet temper will mode|rate
both these; the <HI>first,</HI> by holding <HI>pleasure</HI> a pa|stime,
and no <HI>businesse;</HI> the <HI>last,</HI> by applying a cure to
an incessant care, and immixing some <HI>pleasure</HI> with
<HI>businesse,</HI> to attemper it, lest it incline to heauinesse.
Both which, equally concurring, are euer conferring
to the labouring mind, inward quietnesse.</P>
<P>COmplexion inclosed in a box, giues no tincture
to the Cheeke, nor morall precepts vnapplyed,
beauty to the minde. Thus farre haue we proceeded
in directions of <HI>Behauiour;</HI> insisting on such remar|kable
obseruances, as might better enable you in
each particular. Wee are now to lay before you, vp|on

<P>Apes are catcht in Desarts by imitation. Would
not you be caught by indiscretion? Imitate nothing
<PB N="56" REF="52">
seruilely, it detracts from your <HI>gentility.</HI> I haue noted
some of our Chambermaids take vpon them such an
vnbeseeming state, when they came to visit their
poore friends in the Country, as they punctually re|tain'd
both gate and garb of their mincing Mistresses
in the City. To their Parish-Church they repaire to

they will not sticke to returne this maiesticke an|swer:
<HI>We thanke you my good people.</HI> It is discretion
that appropriates to euery peculiar degree their pro|per

which agree not with the quality of the

that shee may hide the want or greatnesse of
her teeth. Another contracts with her Tayler, lest
<HI>Nemesis</HI> should bee seene sitting on her shoulder. A
third weares her Gowne with a carelesse loosenesse,
to couer or colour her bodies crookednesse. This,
with <HI>Fabulla,</HI> buyes an artfull Periwig to supply her
art-fallen haire. That enazures her seered veines,
embolsters her decayed brests, to purchase a sweet|hart.
What an <HI>affected</HI> state this generally-infected
state assumes, purposely to gaine a popular esteeme?
Suruey our streets, gaze on our windowes; you
shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ee gazers to entertaine your eyes with variety
of phantasticke <HI>Behauiours.</HI> But these are none of
<HI>Vertues</HI> followers. Would you bee prayse-worthy?
Vertue to her selfe is her chiefest prayse, her choy|cest
prize. There is nothing comparably precious to
<PB N="57" REF="52">
a Continent soule. <HI>Affectation</HI> shee will not admit,
for her habit; both her <HI>Habit</HI> and <HI>Behauiour</HI> are pro|per
and not enforced; natiue and not apishly intro|duced.
Shee cannot wooe a wanton Louer with a
dissembled blush, nor promise more with an out|ward
presence, than shee resolues to admit with a
spotlesse Conscience. Outward semblances, if light,
shee holds apparant blemishes to her life. Her <HI>life,</HI>
as it is a <HI>line</HI> to her selfe, so shee would haue it a <HI>light</HI>
to others. <HI>Lacides,</HI> Prince of <HI>Argos,</HI> was accounted
lasciuious onely for his sleeke lookes, and mincing
gate. So <HI>Pompey,</HI> because hee vsed to scratch his
head with one finger, albeit very Continent and
modest. Beleeue it, though your <HI>Person</HI> be the <HI>Booke,</HI>
your <HI>Behauiour</HI> is the <HI>Index.</HI> Which will require a
large <HI>Comment,</HI> if it expresse it selfe in ought proba|bly
incontinent. Now, for as much as nothing bet|ter
seemes you, more commendably adornes you, or
more absolutely accommodates you, than what is
natiue and vnaffected, so it be by <HI>Education</HI> seasoned:
be your owne Women; dis-value all apish formality;
resort not to the Temple to take a patterne of some
new fashion: modest discretion blusheth at such ser|uile
imitation. What you see in another, may be|come
them, which would not become another. The
Asse in the fable seeing the dogge fawne and leap vp|on
his Master, thought it would beseeme him, but
sorting not with his nature, it got him a beating for
his labour.</P>
<P>Now to distinguish betwixt an enforced and vn|affected
<HI>Behauiour,</HI> it is most easie; the very first blush
will discouer the one by the other. You shall ob|serue
these who are tyed to <HI>affectation</HI> in this kinde,
set their looke, gate, and whatsoeuer else may con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ferre
a phantasticke grace on their vsurped <HI>Behauiour,</HI>
so punctually, as if they had entred a solemne Con|tract
<PB N="58" REF="53">
with eye, face, hand, foot and all, to hold con|stantly
their dimension, to beget in the beholder a
more setled admiration. Whereas contrariwise, these
whose free, genuine, and generous demeanours ex|presse
themselues lesse strictly, but farre more come|ly;
scorne to tye their affections to these seruile re|straints.
They hold it farre more sutable with an <HI>I|talian
Pantomime,</HI> who professeth hope of profit vp|on
the Stage, to confine them to these regularities,
than discreet Women, whose honour is their honest
<HI>Behauiour:</HI> and whose praise it is, to bee exemplary
to others in goodnesse, and not others Apes in imita|ting
their phantasticke fashions. To conclude then
this <HI>Obseruation;</HI> as you are <HI>generous</HI> by birth, dote
not on that which is most ridiculous on this Stage of
earth. Approue your selues chaste Virgins, conti|nent
Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">es, discreet Matrons, honourable Wid|dowes,
in your vertuous and modest demeanour.
Preserue that eternally, which giues accomplishment
to Gentility. Your Educations (as may be presuppo|sed)
haue so beautified you, as the garbe you retaine
is most proper vnto you. The <HI>Hyaene</HI> is a dangerous
beast: yet her subtilty and cruelty take life from <HI>af|fectation</HI>
and <HI>imitation.</HI> Desire you to bee so <HI>Behau'd,</HI>
as others may admire you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> In your choyce of <HI>Beha|uiour,</HI>
inure your selues to what is <HI>neatest,</HI> not what is

more harme than good. So <HI>behaue</HI> your selues, that
too much curiosity may not taxe you of pride, nor
too much maiesty of State: Modesty mixt with hu|mility
will temper both these, and make that <HI>Beha|uiour</HI>
which appeares in you, so well become you, as
if it were borne with you, and not <HI>affectiuely</HI> deriued

those times publikely, but what was by the grauer
Censors first discussed priuately. Iealous were the
Pagans of forraine fashions: for, with such constan|cy
they retained their owne; as they seldome or ne|uer
itched after others. The <HI>Tyrian</HI> and <HI>Sidonian</HI>
were so suspected of pride, through their effeminacy
in attire, and other light fashions which they vsed,
as they were held dangerous to commerce with. So
purely did those poore beamelings of Nature reflect

relisheth not of Ciuility; the author must suffer the
censure of the City. It was very vsuall in former
times, when any Embassie was addressed from one
state vnto another, for the Senate or Councell, from
whence any such Legate was sent, to schoole them in
sundry particulars before they tooke their iourney or
receiued their Commission: but in no caution were
they more strict, than in expresse command that
they should vse no other garbe, <HI>Complement,</HI> nor sa|lute
vpon their approach in forraine Courts, than
what they had seene vsed and obserued at home.
Thus their owne natiue fashion, became a note of

<P>Neither am I ignorant, how euen in one and the

a different or distinct garbe: which procee|deth

or from the Princes Court, where all State and

the Ayre, to which some haue attributed an especiall
preeminence. Whereas, in desart and remote places,
on which the beames of Ciuill society seldome re|flect,
wee shall finde nothing but barbarisme and vn|sociable

<HI>Complement.</HI></P>
<P>Some haue held, it consisted in congies, cringes,
and salutes; of which errour, I would this age
wherein we liue, did not too much labour: others,
meerely in a painted and superficiall discourse; wher|in
they so miserably tyed themselues to words, as
they tyred the impatient hearers with foolish repe|titions,
friuolous extrauagancies; being, in a word,
so affianced to the <HI>shadow,</HI> as they forgot the <HI>substance.</HI>
The last, which were onely <HI>reall</HI> and <HI>complete</HI> Cour|tiers,
held a seemely gracefull presence, beautifide
with a natiue comelinesse, the deseruingst <HI>Comple|ment</HI>
that could attend vs. Certainely, if we should
exactly weigh the deriuation of the word, we could
not imagine so meanely of it, as to consist meerely
of words, or anticke workes. It was first intended
to distinguish betwixt persons of ciuill and sauage
<PB N="62" REF="55">
carriage: yea, to appropriate a title of preeminence to
such, who exceeded others in grounds or pecepts of
Morality; whose liues appeared as Lampes to enligh|ten
others, and consequently perpetuate the memory
of themselues. Many noble and eminent Ladies are
recorded both in diuine and humane writ to haue ex|celled
in this <HI>Complement</HI> of honour. These knew
the <HI>definition</HI> of it, and moulded their conuersation to
it: They knew what belonged to a posture of state;
they could court it without apish curiosity; embrace
loue with a reserued modesty; expresse themselues
<HI>complete</HI> without singularity. Forraigne fashions they
distasted; painted Rhetoricke they disrelished; <HI>re|all
Complement</HI> was all they affected. Loue they could
without dissembling; discourse without affecting;
shew curt'sie without congying; still retaining
what was best beseeming. In the Court they resided
to better it; not a straid looke could promise a loo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e
Louer least hope of a purchase; nor Coynesse dishear|ten
a faithfull seruant from his affectionate purpose.
They knew not what it was to protest in iest; to
walke in the clouds; to domineere ouer their cap|tiues,
or entertaine many Suitors. They freed <HI>Com|plement</HI>
of dissimulation, made vertue their Load|stone
to affection; their actions were dedicated to
good ends: by which meanes they made <HI>God</HI> and
<HI>goodmen</HI> their friends. Nor doe I feare it, but that
our flourishing <HI>Albion</HI> hath many such noble and
<HI>complete</HI> Ladies; who so highly esteeme the true and

<P>THere is nothing on earth so pure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How <HI>Comple|ment</HI> may be corrupted.</NOTE> but abuse may
<HI>corrupt</HI> it; nothing so good, but custome may

which wee haue now in discourse. Former times
were not so <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">aded</HI> to <HI>fashions,</HI> as to esteeme nothing
<HI>formall,</HI> but what was <HI>phantasticall.</HI> It was not then
held the life of <HI>Complement,</HI> to haue the art to set a

were held for vsefull supporters, but no <HI>Complemen|tall</HI>
postures. New-minted words made not their
tongues more <HI>complete;</HI> nor an Outlandish Salute
their Persons more admired. Virgin-modesty made
resolution her <HI>Steletto</HI> to guard her honour. Plumes
and Feathers were held light dressings for staid
minds; suspicious trimmings for stale Maids. Actors
might weare them in their presentments vpon the
Stage, but modest Matrons were neuer allowed to
weare them in the state. Women were admitted to
haue Painters, but not to be their owne painters:
<HI>Campaspe</HI> was pictured out in her colours by <HI>Apelles:
Crotons</HI> fiue daughters liuely depictured by <HI>Ze<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">xes;</HI>
yet these, without any helpe of art, still retained
their owne natiue features. It was the <HI>Complement</HI>
of that age to deliuer their minde freely without
mincing, conuerse friendly without glozing; walke
the street demurely without gazing. Wherein (with
submission euer to graue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> iudgements) this latter
age, in mine opinion, deserues iust reproofe. Edu|cation
is a second Nature, and this hath giuen that

to entertaine time with their amorous seruants;

made beguilers of time; and these mixt now and then
with such lasciuious passages, as modesty might iust|ly
hold it selfe abused to be so encountred. Alas! Who
knowes not what secret traines are laid for credulous
women, vnder these pretenced parlies? Doe you ob|serue
how their tongues are tipt with your prayses;
how they honour your shadowes; admire the earth
you tread on; adore the Ayre you breath on; and
with their ayrie applauses so gild you, as in the end
they palpably gull you; leauing you no lesse misera|bly

It is <HI>Society</HI> that giues vs, or takes from vs our

whatsoeuer in the Countrey deserues most prayse.
And all this in such a proper and familiar manner, as
such who are tied to <HI>Complement,</HI> may aspire to it, but
neuer attaine it. Hee that hath once tasted of the

And there they shall finde <HI>Women</HI> highly cen|sured,
for that their outward carriage onely made
<PB N="83" REF="65">
them suspected. A vaile couered their <HI>face,</HI> modesty
measured out their <HI>pace;</HI> their <HI>Spectators</HI> were as so
many <HI>Censors:</HI> Circumspect therefore were they of
their carriage, lest they should become a scandall or
blemish to their sexe. Their repaire to their Tem|ples
was <HI>decent,</HI> without any loose or light gesture;
Entring their Temples, constant and setled was their
behauiour. Quicke was their <HI>pace</HI> in dispatch of
houshold affaires; but slow in their Epicureall vi|sits
or sensuall gossipings. They had not the art of i|mitating
such hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ing and mounting <HI>gates,</HI> as our
light-spirited Dames now vse. They were not as
then learn'd to <HI>pace:</HI> so far estrang'd were they from
the very least conceit of vanity in this kinde. How
much more should these purer times, where verity
is taught and embraced, vanity so much tax'd and
reproued, affect that most, which adornes and beau|tifies
most? Is it not palpable folly, to walke so
hautily in these streets of our captiuity? Eye your
<HI>feet,</HI> those <HI>bases</HI> of frailty, how they, who so proud|ly
strut on earth, are but earth, and approach daily
nearer their earth. The <HI>Swan,</HI> when she prides her
selfe in her <HI>whitenesse,</HI> reflects on her <HI>blacke feet,</HI> which
brings downe her plumes, and allayes her selfe-con|ceit
with more humblenesse. What anticke Pageants
shall wee behold in this suruey of Earth? With
what <HI>Apish</HI> gestures they walke, which taxeth them
of lightnesse? How like <HI>Colosso's</HI> others walke,
which discouers their haughtinesse? how <HI>punctually</HI>
these, as if they were Puppets drawn by an enforced
motion? How <HI>phantastically</HI> those, as if their walke
were a theatrall action? These vnstaid <HI>dimensions</HI> ar|gue
vnsetled <HI>dispositions.</HI> All is not well with them.
For if one of the <HI>Spartan Ephori</HI> was to lose his place,
because he obseru'd no <HI>Decency</HI> in his <HI>pace,</HI> how may
we be opinion'd of such <HI>Women,</HI> whose <HI>yeeres</HI> exact
<PB N="84" REF="66">
of them stayednesse, whose places retaine in them
more peculiar reuerence, and whose <HI>descents</HI> inioyne
them to a state-reseruance; when they, to gaine ob|seruance,
admit of any <HI>new,</HI> but <HI>vndecent</HI> posture?
Deserue these approuement? No; <HI>discretion</HI> cannot
prize them, nor <HI>iudgement</HI> prayse them, <HI>Vulgar opi|nion,</HI>
whose applause neuer receiues life from desert,
may admire what is <HI>new,</HI> but <HI>discretion</HI> that onely
which is <HI>neat.</HI> It is one thing to walke honestly as
on the day, another thing to walke vnciuilly as on
the night. <HI>Decency</HI> becomes the one; <HI>Deformity</HI> the
other. Neither onely are <HI>modest women</HI> to be caute|lous
<HI>how</HI> they walke, but <HI>where</HI> they walke. Some
places there be, whereto if they repaire, walke they
neuer so <HI>Ciuilly,</HI> they cannot walke <HI>honestly.</HI> Those
who value reputation, will not be seene there; for
<HI>Honour</HI> is too deare a purchase to be set at sale. Such
as frequent these places, haue exposed themselues to
shame; and made an irreuocable Contract with sinne.
They make choyce of the Twy-light, lest their paths
should be discouered; and shrowd their distained
actions with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">able Curtaine of night, lest they
should bee displayed. These, howsoeuer their <HI>feet</HI>
walke softly, their <HI>hearts</HI> poste on swiftly, to seize on
the voluptuous prey of folly.</P>
<P>Farre be these wayes from your walkes, vertuous
Ladies, whose modesty makes you honored of your
Sexe. Though your <HI>feet</HI> be here below, let your
<HI>faith</HI> be aboue. Let no path of pleasure draw you
from those ioyes which last for euer. Though the
<HI>world</HI> be your <HI>walke</HI> while you soiourne here; <HI>hea|uen</HI>
should be your <HI>ayme,</HI> that you may repose eter|nally
there. Liue deuoutly, walke demurely, professe
constantly; that deuotion may instruct you, your
wayes direct you, your profession conduct you to
your heauenly Countrey. It is a probable argument,
<PB N="85" REF="66">
that such an one hates her Countrey, where onely she
is to become Citizen, who thinkes it to bee well
with her here, where shee is a Pilgrim. Walke in
this maze of your Pilgrimage, that after death you
may enioy a lasting heritage. So shall you praise God
in the <HI>gate,</HI> and after your Christian race finished, re|ceiue
a Crowne.</P>
<P>IT is most true, that a wanton Eye is the truest e|uidence<NOTE PLACE="marg">LOOKE.</NOTE>
of a wandring and distracted minde. The
<HI>Arabians</HI> prouerbe is elegant; <HI>Shut the windowes,
that the house may giue light.</HI> It is <HI>death</HI> that enters
in by the <HI>windowes.</HI> The <HI>House</HI> may be secured, if these
be closed. Whence it was, that princely Prophet
praid so earnestly: <HI>Lord turne away mine eyes from va|nity.</HI>
And hence appeares mans misery. That those
<HI>Eyes,</HI> which should be the Cesternes of sorrow, lim|beckes
of contrition, should become the lodges of
lust, and portals of our perdition. That those which
were giuen vs for assistants and associates, should be|come
our assacinats. Our <HI>Eye</HI> is made the sense of
<HI>sorrow,</HI> because the <HI>sense</HI> of <HI>sinne;</HI> yet more apt is she
to giue way to sinne, then to finde one teare to rinse
her sinne. An <HI>vncleane eye</HI> is the <HI>messenger</HI> of an <HI>vn|cleane
heart:</HI> confine the one, and it will be a means
to rectifie the other. Many dangerous obiects will
a <HI>wandring eye</HI> finde, whereon to vent the disposition
of her corrupt heart. No place is exempted, no sub|iect
freed. The <HI>ambitious eye</HI> makes <HI>honour</HI> her <HI>obiect,</HI>
wherewith the afflicts her selfe, both in aspiring to
what she cannot enioy, as likewise in seeing another
enioy that, whereto her selfe did aspire. The <HI>Cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|tous</HI>
makes wealth her <HI>obiect;</HI> which shee obtaines
with toile, enioyes with feare, forgoes with griefe:
for being got they load her, lou'd they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">oile her, lost

they gall her. The <HI>Enuious</HI> makes her <HI>Neighbours</HI>
flourishing field, or fruitfull haruest, her <HI>obiect;</HI> she
cannot but looke on it, looking pine and repine at it,
and repining iustly consume her spirit with <HI>enuying</HI>
it. The <HI>Lasciuious</HI> makes <HI>beauty</HI> her <HI>obiect,</HI> and with a
<HI>leering looke,</HI> while she throweth out her <HI>lure</HI> to catch
others, she becomes catcht her selfe. This <HI>obiect,</HI> be|cause
it reflects most on your <HI>sexe,</HI> let it be thus dis|posed,
that the inward <HI>eye</HI> of your soules may be on
a superiour beauty fixed. Doe ye admire the come|linesse
of any creature? remoue your <HI>eye</HI> from that
<HI>obiect,</HI> and bestow it on the contemplation of your
Creator. Wormes and flyes, that haue laye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> dead all
winter, by reflexe of the Sunne beames, are reuiued:
so these <HI>flesh-flyes,</HI> who haue beene long time buried
in these sensuall <HI>Obiects</HI> of earth, no sooner reflect on
the <HI>Sunne of righteousnesse,</HI> than they become enliue|ned
and enlightened. Those filmes which darkened
the <HI>eye</HI> of their mindes, are remoued, those thicke
Cataracts of earthly vanities are dispersed and dis|pelled,
and a new light into a new heart infused.</P>
<P>I know well, <HI>Gentlewomen,</HI> that your resort to
places of eminent resort, cannot but minister to you
variety of Obiects. Yea, euen where nothing but
chaste thoughts, staid lookes, and zealous desires
should harbour, are now and then loose thoughts,
light lookes, and licentious desires in especiall ho|nour.
The meanes to preuent this malady, which
like a spreading vlcer disperseth it selfe in euery soci|ety,
is neither willingly to take nor be taken. <HI>Dinah</HI>
may be a proper Embleme for the <HI>eye;</HI> shee seldome
strayes abroad, but shee is in danger of rauishing.
Now to preserue purity of heart, you must obserue
a vigilant discipline ouer euery sense. Where, if the
<HI>eye,</HI> which is the light of the body, be not well dis|posed,
the rest of the senses cannot choose but be
<PB N="87" REF="67">
much darkned. We say, that the want of one pecu|liar
sense supplies that defect with an higher degree
of perfection in the rest. Sure I am, there is no one
sense that more distempers the harmony of the mind,
nor prospect of the Soule, then this <HI>window</HI> of the bo|dy.
It opens euer to the <HI>Ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">en,</HI> but seldome to the
<HI>Doue.</HI> Rauing affections it easily conueyes to the
heart; but Doue-like innocence it rarely retaines
in the brest. As it is a member of the flesh, so be|comes
it a seruant of the flesh; apprehending with
greedinesse, whatsoeuer may minister fuell to carnall
concupiscence. This you shall easily correct, by fix|ing
her on that pure and absolute <HI>obiect,</HI> for which
she was made. It is obserued by profest <HI>Oeulists</HI> (an
obseruation right worthy a Christians serious consi|deration)
that whereas all creatures haue but <HI>foure
Muscles</HI> to turn their eyes round about, man hath a <HI>fift</HI>
to pull his <HI>eyes</HI> vp to heauen. Doe not then depresse
your <HI>eyes,</HI> as if they were fixed on earth, nor turne
them round, by gazing on the fruitlesse vanities of
earth; but on <HI>heauen,</HI> your <HI>hauen</HI> after earth. In the
Philosophers scale, the soule of a <HI>flye</HI> is of more ex|cellence
then the <HI>Sunne;</HI> in a Christian scale, the
soule of man is infinitely more precious then all
creatures vnder the Sunne. Preserue then the honour
of a <HI>beautifull soule,</HI> which suffers infinitely when it
is blemished with any soile. So order and dispose
your <HI>lookes,</HI> as censure may not taxe you of lightnesse,
nor an amorous glance impeach you of wantonnesse.
Send not forth a tempting <HI>eye</HI> to take another; nor
entertaine a tempting <HI>looke</HI> darting from another.
Neither take not be taken. To become a prey to
others, will slaue you; to make a prey of others,
will transport you. Looke then vpward, where the
more you <HI>looke</HI> you shall <HI>like,</HI> the longer you <HI>liue</HI> you
shall <HI>loue.</HI></P>

VVIthout <HI>Speech</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SPEECH.</NOTE> can no society subsist. By it

Philosophers which gouerned his house. This Opi|nion
tasted of too much strictnesse (will our <HI>women</HI>

of discourse, be the argument neuer so course
whereon they treat. Truth is, their tongues are
held their defensiue armour; but in no particular de|tract
they more from their honour, than by giuing
too free scope to that glibbery member. For to such
as professe their ability at this weapon, may that say|ing
of <HI>Pand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lphus</HI> be properly applied: <HI>They speake
much ill, but they speake little well; they speake much,
but doe little.</HI> Againe, <HI>They doe little well, but they doe
much ill; they say well, but doe ill.</HI> They promise much,
but doe little. What restraint is required in respect
of the tongue, may appeare by that iuory guard or
garrison with which it is impaled. See, how it is
double warded, that it may with more reseruancy
and better security be restrained! To giue liberty to
the tongue to vtter what it list, is the argument of
an indiscreet person, In much <HI>Speech</HI> there can ne|uer
want sinne, it either leaues some tincture of vain-glory,
which discouers the proud heart, from whence
it proceeded; or some taste of scurrility, which dis|playes
the wanton heart, from whence it streamed;
or some violent and dispassionate heat, which pro|claimes
<PB N="89" REF="68">
a rancorous heart, from whence it issued.
Whereas, a well-disposed mind will not speake be|fore
it conceiue; nor deliuer ought by way of ex|pression,
till it be prepared by a well-seasoned delibe|ration.
That Philosophers speech deserues retention;
who seeing a silent guest at a publike feast, vsed these

whose bashfull silence is an ornament to their Sexe.
Volubility of tongue in these, argues either rude|nesse
of breeding, or boldnesse of expression. The
<HI>former&punc;</HI> may be reclaimed by a discreet Tutor, but the
<HI>latter,</HI> being grounded on arrogancy of conceit, sel|dome

whose generous education hath estranged you

for a <HI>young woman</HI> to be prolocutor. But especi|ally,
when either men are in presence, or ancient Ma|trons,
to whom shee owes a ciuill reuerence, it will
become her to tip her tongue with silence. Touching
the subiect of your discourse, when opportunity shall
exact it of you, and without touch of immodesty
expect it from you; make choyce of such arguments
as may best improue your knowledge in houshold af|faires,

of State-matters, will not become your auditory:

<P>In the whole current of your discourse, let no light

calumny runne descant on your tongue: it discouers
your passion too much; in the meane time, venting

<P>THere is nothing which moues vs more to pride

couer our <HI>shame.</HI> The fruit of a Tree made man a sin|ner;
and the leaues of a Tree gaue him a couer. In
your <HI>Habit</HI> is your modesty best expressed; your di|spositions
best discouered. The <HI>Habit</HI> of the mind is
discerned by the state or posture of the body; the
condition or quality of the body by the <HI>Habit,</HI> which
either addes or detracts from her beauty. As we can|not
probably imagine such to haue modest mindes,
who haue immodest eyes; so can wee not properly
say such <HI>women</HI> to be modest matrons or professors of
piety, who in their <HI>attire</HI> shew arguments of their
immodesty. It skils not much, for the quality of your
<HI>habits,</HI> whether they be silken or wollen, so they bee
ciuill and not wanton. For albeit, some haue affir|med
that all <HI>gorgeous attire</HI> is the <HI>attire</HI> of <HI>sinne,</HI> the
quality of the <HI>person</HI> may seeme to extenuate the qua|lity
of that sinne. For noble and eminent persona|ges
were in all times admitted to weare them; and
<PB N="92" REF="70">
to be distinguished by them: Neither indeed, is the
<HI>sumptuousnes</HI> of the <HI>habit,</HI> so reprehensiue as the phan|tasticknes
of the <HI>habit</HI> respect of the form or fashion.
It is this which derogates highly from the repute of
a Christian, to see her affect variety &amp; inconstancy of
<HI>attire,</HI> more than euer did Pagan. There is nothing
which introduceth more effeminacy into any flouri|shing
State, than vanity in <HI>habit.</HI> Where we may ob|serue
<HI>fashion,</HI> many times&punc; so long affected, til all <HI>fashion</HI>
become exiled. Surely, whatsoeuer our lighter dispo|sed
Curtezans thinke, it is Ciuility which adds most
grace, <HI>Decency</HI> which expresseth best state, and com|lines
in <HI>attire</HI> which procures most loue. Other <HI>habits,</HI>
as they display the mind of the wearer, so are they
subiects of laughter or contempt to any discreet be|holder.
Time is too precious to be made a <HI>Pageant</HI> or
<HI>Morrice</HI> on. These misconceiued ornaments are meer
deformities to good minds. Vertuous and discreet
Matrons would be loath to weare ought that might
giue least scandall or offence to their sexe. Forraine fa|shions
are no baits to catch them, nor phantastick, ra|ther
phanaticke dressings to delude them. They can|not
eye that <HI>habit</HI> which deserues approuing, nor that
<HI>attire</HI> which merits louing, where Ciuility is not pat|tern.
<HI>Decency</HI> is their choycest liberty, which sets the~
forth aboue a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">l Embroydery. There was an ancient
Edict amongst the <HI>Romans,</HI> purposely to rid the State
of all vselesse loyterers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. in lib. de leg.</NOTE> that no <HI>Roman</HI> should goe
through the streets of the City, vnlesse hee carried
with him the badge or signall of that Trade where|by
he liued: insomuch, that <HI>Marc, Aurelius,</HI> spea|king

or what badges they might beare to signifie their
profession. Would not these new-found Artists haue
beene rather derided than approued, geered than ap|plauded?
Sure, <HI>Rome</HI> was more ciuill than to giue
way to so contagious an euill. <HI>Vesta</HI> had her maidens,
so had <HI>Viriplaca</HI> her Matrons; but neither of their
followers could admit of any new-minted fashions.
That Lady City had neuer soueraniz'd ouer so many

had shee exposed her selfe to such vanity, which had
beene the greatest Eclypse to her spreading glory.</P>

The <HI>Spouse</HI> in the <HI>Cantiales</HI> was <HI>blacke&punc;</HI> but <HI>comely;</HI> and

more affection in a light heart, but in a vertuous

age, where the be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters"> shot to be discharg'd is the Ta|uerne
bill, the best Alarum is the sounding of healths,
and the most absolute March is reeling; discretion

measured by what we are, but what we weare. Va|nity
hath set vp her <HI>Flagge;</HI> and more fresh-water
souldiers desire to fight vnder her Banner, than the
<HI>Ensigne</HI> of honour. But all this workes little vpon a
constant and rightly-tempered disposition. Such an
one plants there his loue, where with comfort hee
may liue. Doe you thinke that a jetting <HI>Gate,</HI> a lee|ring
<HI>Looke,</HI> a glibbery <HI>Tongue,</HI> or gaudy <HI>Attire</HI> can
moue affection in any one worthy your loue? Sure
no; he deserues a <HI>light one</HI> for his choyce, who makes
his choyce by one of these. To be an admirer of one
of these, were to preferre in his choyce a <HI>May|marrian</HI>
before a <HI>Modest Matron.</HI> Now there are
some fashions which become one incomparably
more than another; the reason whereof may be im|puted
either to the natiue <HI>propriety</HI> of the <HI>party</HI> vsing
that forme, habit, or complement; or else to the <HI>qua|lity</HI>
of the <HI>person,</HI> which makes the fashion vsed, infi|nitely
more gracious. For the <HI>first,</HI> you shall neuer
see any thing imitated, but it seemes the imitator
worst at the first. Habit will bring it into a <HI>second na|ture;</HI>
but till such time as custome hath matur'd it,
many imperfections will vsually attend it. Whereas,
whatsoeuer is naturally inbred in vs, will best be|seeme
and adorne vs; it needs no other face than
what nature gaue it, and would generally become
worse, were it neuer so little enforced. For the <HI>se|cond,</HI>
as in any Theatrall presentment, what becomes
a Peere or Potentate, would not sort with the condi|tion
of any inferiour substitute; euery one must bee
suited to the person he presents: So in the Theatre of
state, distinct fashions both in <HI>Habit</HI> and <HI>Complement</HI>
are to be retained, according to the place wherein
he is ranked. <HI>Lucrece,</HI> no doubt, stamped a deeper
impression of affection in the heart of her beholder,

lightnesse. This argued, that a youthfull heat had ra|ther
surpriz'd his amorous heart, than any discreet
affection preferr'd him to his choyce. But how va|ding
is that loue, which is so lightly grounded?
To what dangerous ouertures is it exposed? Where
<HI>Vertue</HI> is not directrice in our choyce, our inconstant
mindes are euer prone to change. Wee finde not
what we expected; nor digest well what we for|merly

vertuous and victorious <HI>Theodosius;</HI> no lesse renow|ned
for her learning and other exquisite endow|ments

imperiall title, to which she was afterwards aduan|ced.
The Centons of <HI>Homer</HI> she composed, and into

<P>These were tender Nurses, carefull Mothers, reue|rend
Matrons. Or to giue them that title which an|tiquity
hath bestowed on them; they were in so
darke and cloudy a time, patternes of piety, presi|dents
of purity, champions of chastity, mirrours of
modesty, iewels of integrity. Women (to vse <HI>Plu|tarchs</HI>
words) so deuoted to contemplating, as they
conceiued no delight in dancing; yet could not con|templation
estrange them from performing such
proper offices as did concerne them. They knew
<PB N="110" REF="79">
what it was to obey; that it was not fit for an <HI>inferi|our
member</HI> to command the <HI>head,</HI> nor for them to so|ueraignize
ouer their husbands. What had sometimes
beene taught them by their Mothers, they now care|fully
recommend to the serious reuiew of their
Daughters.
<Q><L>Wiues with obedience husbands should subdue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sen. in Octau.</NOTE></L>
<L>For by this meanes they'le be subdu'd to you.</L></Q></P>
<P>Thus learned they the duty of a wife, before they
aspired to that title: conforme your selues to their
examples: the cloud which kept them from a full
view of their condition, is in respect of you, disper|sed;
your eyes are cleared, not with any Pagan er|rour
filmed. Be then in this your Christian coniugall

if you be so <HI>indeed.</HI> This name both from the
Greeke and Latine hath receiued one consonant Eti|mology;
<HI>depriued</HI> or <HI>destitute.</HI> Great difference then
is there, betwixt those widowes who liue alone, and
retire themselues from publike concourse, and those
which frequent the company of men. For a widow
to loue society, albeit her intentions relish nothing
but sobriety, giues speedy wings to spreading infa|my.
Saint <HI>Hierom</HI> writing to <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">stachia,</HI> giues her this
counsell; <Q>If thou shalt finde any question in Scrip|ture,
harder then thou canst well resolue; demand
satisfaction from such an one, who is of a most ap|proued
life, ripe age; that by the integrity of his
person, thou maist be secured from the least asper|sion:</Q>
for in popular concourse and Court-re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">orts
there is no pace for widowes: for in such meetings
she exposeth her honour to danger, which aboue all
others she ought incomparably to tender. Yea, but
<PB N="111" REF="79">
will you obiect: admit, our inheritance, family, for|tunes,
and all lye a bleeding? may we not make re|course
to publike Courts, for redresse of our publike
wrongs? What of all this? Doe not complaine that
you are desolate or alone, Modesty affecteth silence
and secrecy; a chaste woman solitarinesse and priuacy.
If you haue businesse with the Iudge of any Court,
and you much feare the power of your aduersary, im|ploy
all your care to this end, that your faith may be
grounded in those promises of Christ: <Q>Your Lord
maketh intercession for you, rendring right iudge|ment
to the Orphane, and righteousnesse vnto the
widow.</Q></P>
<P>This inestimable inheritance of Chastity is incom|parably
more to be esteemed, and with greater care
preserued by <HI>Widowes</HI> then <HI>Wiues:</HI> albeit, by these
neither to be neglected, but highly valued. Out of
that ancient experience which time hath taught
them, their owne obseruations inform'd them, and
the reuerence of their condition put vpon them;
they are to instruct others in the practice of piety;
reclaime others from the pathes of folly, and with a
vertuous conuoy guide them to glory. It would lesse
become them to tricke and trimme themselues gau|dily
or gorgeously, then yong girles, whose beauty
and outward ornament is the hope and anchor-hold
of their preferment: for by these doe the husbands
seeke, and hope in time to get what they seeke.
Whereas, it were much more commendable for wi+dowes
neither to seeke them, nor being offred, to ac|cept
them: le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> enforced by necessity, or wonne by
importunacy, or giuing way to their frailty, they
make exchange of their happy estate for a continuate
scene of misery. A widow ought to pray feruently,
to exercise workes of deuotion frequently, that the
benefit of her prayer redound to her effectually
<PB N="112" REF="80">
and fruitfully; and not returne backe from the throne
of God drily or emptily. For I would (according to
<HI>Menanders</HI> opinion) haue a widow not onely to de|meane
her selfe chastely and honestly, but likewise to
giue examples of her b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">amelesse life to such as heare
her instructions attentiuely. For she ought to be as a
Glasse to young Maids, wherein they may discerne
their crimes.</P>
<P>Now I hold her a chaste Widow, who though
she haue opportunity to doe it, and be suited by im|portunity
vnto it, yet will not suffer her brest to
harbour an vnchaste thought, or consent vnto it. In
that Countrey where I was borne (saith <HI>Lud. Viues</HI>)
we vsually terme such widowes the greatest associ|ates
and assistants of vices, whose too much delica|cy
in bringing vp their children, makes them oft|times-depraued,
and to all inordinate liberty addi|cted.
Wherefore, I approue well of their course, who
recommend the care of their children to some dis|creet
and well-disposed person. For such is the too
tender affection of mothers towards their children,
and so much are they blinded with the loue of them,
as they thinke they treat them too roughly, albeit
they embrace them neuer so tenderly.</P>
<P>Saint <HI>Hierome</HI> writing vnto <HI>Saluina,</HI> saith; The
chastity of a woman is fraile and fading&punc; like a flower
quickly perishing and vading, with the least gust
or blast of aduerse Fortune failing, if not falling:
especially, where her age is apt for vice, and the au|thority
of her husband wants to afford her aduice;
from whose assistance, her honour deriues her best
succour and supportance. Who, if shee haue a great
family, many things are required of her, and to bee
found in her, to minister supply to the necessity of
time, and vse of affaires, wherein she stands interes|sed.
Requisite therefore it were, that shee made
<PB N="113" REF="80">
choyce of some one discreetly ripe both in yeares
and inward gifts, by whose honest integrity her fa|mily
might bee better mannaged, with more dili|gence
attended, and to the woman lesse occasion of
disgrace obiected.</P>
<P>For I haue knowne very many women, who albeit
they spent their daies continually within their owne
doores, yet haue fallen into reproach either by some
persons obseruing them, or of their owne families
disposed by them; for suffering their seruants goe a|broad
to neatly, arguing thereby a neglect of their
family: so as the handmaids pride brought her Mi|stresse
into suspition of contemning her honour.</P>
<P>Sure it is, that an honest woman, whose fame is
her highest prize, requires nothing else, desires no|thing
else, than to satisfie her husbands bequest,
though dead: honouring him with a due Comme|moration
and admiration of his vertues: for the liues
of those that dye, consist in the memory of those that
liue. So did <HI>Anthonia</HI> the daughter of <HI>Marc. Autho|nie,</HI>
and wife to <HI>Drusus:</HI> leading all the remainder of
her life with her stepmother, and retaining alwayes
the remembrance of her dead husband. The like did
<HI>Liuia,</HI> who left both her house and land, that shee
might dwell vnder one roofe with <HI>Noemia:</HI> fearing,
perhaps, lest the Maids of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">r family growing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">oo
lasciuiously wanton and inordinate, might by their
lightnesse preiudice her honor, which she incompa|rably
valued aboue any treasure. See you not hereby
our discourse (<HI>Gentlewomen</HI>) what excellent Lights
darted out from those darke times! <HI>Estimation</HI> was
their best portion; nothing of equall prize vnto it
vertues were their choycest Ornaments, which they
preseru'd with such constancy, as feare of death could
not depriue them of them, though after death they
had scarce the least glimpse of immortality.</P>

that it becomes not a Maid to speake of marriage in
her parents presence, for that were small argument of
modesty or shamefastnesse. There is a pretty pleasing
kinde of wooing drawne from a conceiued but con|cealed
<HI>Fancy;</HI> which, in my opinion, suits well with
these amorous younglins: they could wish with all
their hearts to be euer in the presence of those they

Might they chuse, they would conuerse with them
freely, con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ort with them friendly, and impart their
truest thoughts fully, yet would they not haue their

<P>Now in this Subiect of <HI>Fancy,</HI> as there is nothing
more dangerous than entertaining it without due
and deliberate aduice: so there is nothing growes
more generally fatall to the indiscreet Louer, than by
grounding affection on outward respects, without
relation to that <HI>inward faire,</HI> which onely makes the
Obiect of <HI>Fancy</HI> full of beauty, and presents euery
day as a Marriage-day to the party. Neither affluence
of estate, potency of friends, nor highnesse of descent
can attemper the griefe of a loathed bed. These may
play vpon the <HI>Fantasie,</HI> but neuer giue satisfaction to
the <HI>Fancy.</HI> Wherefore <HI>(Gentlewomen)</HI> to the end you
may shew your selues discreetest in that, which re|quires

euer reflecting on those best deseruing endowments

your loue. Affection, though it enter in by the

<PB N="132" REF="90">
which, vnlesse it be seasoned by iudgement, it can

<P><HI>Iustin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> a <HI>Roman</HI> Maid, no lesse nobly descended, than

rich than wise, exclaimed against her fate, that folly
should hale her to so loathed a bed. And good reason
had she to repine, when his groundlesse iealosie made
her a tragick spectacle of misery before her time. For
seeing her white necke, that obiect begot in him pre|sently
an argument of suspect, which hee seconded
with reuenge, to vent the fury of his nature, and pub|lish
to the world the weaknesse of his temper. Let
<HI>deliberation</HI> then be the Scale, wherin you may weigh
Loue in an equall poize. There bee many high and
consequent Circumstances, which a discreet woman
will not onely discourse but discusse, before shee en|tertain
so mysterious and honorable estate. Disparity
in descent, fortunes, friends, with other like respects,
many times beget distraction of mindes. Whence it
was, that <HI>Pittacus</HI> of <HI>Muylene,</HI> being intreated by
a young man, to afford him his best aduice, in the
Choyce of two wiues tendred him, whether hee
should marry; the one whereof was equa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">l to him|selfe
both in birth and wealth; the other surpassing
him in both; Wish'd him to goe along the streets
of the City, where children vse to play, and there
obserue what they did aduise him. Truth is, inequa|lity
in these, procures distaste; but where there is a
difference in the seazure or disposure of the heart,
(which should be the firmest and strongest Cement
to vnite affection) there ariseth the greatest hazard.
Thence is it, Suspition workes vpon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">uery light and

<P>THe selfe-same rule which <HI>Augustus</HI> was said to

are not to be worne like fauours: now in your hat,
or about your wrist, and presently out of request.
Which to preuent, entertaine none to lodge neere
your heart, that may harbor in his brest ought wor|thy
your hate. Those two Motto's I would haue you
incessantly to remember; for the vsefull application
of them may highly conduce to your honour. The
one is that of <HI>Caia Tranquilla,</HI> which she euer vsed to
her royall Spouse <HI>Caius Tarquinius Priscus; Where
th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters"> art Caius, I am Caia.</HI> The other, that of <HI>Ruth</HI> vn|to
<HI>Naomi; Whither thou goest, I will goe; and where thou
dwellest, I will dwell.</HI></P>
<P>There is no greater argument of lightnesse, then
to affect the acquaintance of strangers, and to enter|taine
variety of Suiters. These, as they distract the
<HI>eye,</HI> so they infect the <HI>heart.</HI> Constant you cannot be
where you professe, so long as you affect change.
Vowes deliberately aduised, and religiously groun|ded,
are not to be dispenc'd with. But say, you neuer
vowed: haue you made outward professions of loue,
and entertained a good opinion of that obiect in your
heart? Againe, are you resolued, that his affection
is reall towards you? That his protests, though de|liuered
by his mouth, are engrauen in his heart? Let
not so much good loue be lost; insult not ouer him,
whom vnfained affection hath vow'd your ser|uan.
<Q><PB N="136" REF="92">
<L>Let Wolues and beasts be cruell in their kindes,</L>
<L>But Women meeke, and haue relenting mindes.</L></Q></P>
<P>It were too much incredulity in you to distrust,
where you neuer found iust cause of distaste, Yea,
but you will againe obiect; we are already by your
owne <HI>Obseruations</HI> sn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ficiently instructed, that <HI>Fancy

laid on, lasts not long. Should we then affect before
we finde ground of respect? Should wee entertaine
a Rhetoricall Louer, whose protests are formal Com|plements,
and whose promises are gilded pills, which
couer much bitternesse? No, I would not haue you
so credulous, lest your Nuptiall day become omi|nous.
Make true triall and experiment of his Con|stancy,
who tenders his seruice to you. Sift him, if
you can finde any branne in him. Taske him, before
you take him. Yet let these be sweetly tempred with
lenity; Let them not be Taskes of insuperable dif|ficulty.
This were to tyrannize, where you should
loue. This was <HI>Ompha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">es</HI> fault, to make her faithfull
seruant, a seruile slaue. Alas! shall hee fare the worse
because hee loues you? This would induce others,
who take notice of your cruelty, to loath you. And
make your discarded louer, surprized with an amo|rous
distemper, to reply, as <HI>Absal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">m</HI> to <HI>Hushai, Is this
thy kindnesse to thy friend?</HI> My counsell is, that, as it
will be vsefull for you to <HI>deliberate,</HI> before you take
so much as the least Notions of an affectionate Ser|uant;
yea, and to second that <HI>deliberation</HI> with some
probable proofe or triall, that hee is truly constant:
so it will be a gratefull office in you, to retaine him
in your fauour with a gracious respect; to counte|nance
the improuement of his constancy with a
cheerefull and amiable aspect: to banish all clowds of
seeming discontent, and to giue him some modest
expressions of the increase of your good Conceit to|wards
<PB N="137" REF="92">
him. Let this be done, till <HI>Hymen</HI> make you
indiuidually one. Then, and neuer till then, may
Loue enioy her full freedome. She stands priuiledg'd
by a sacred rite to taste that fruit, which before was
forbidden. Mutuall respects, like so many diametrall
lines, pointing all to one Centre, are then directed
to one exquisite obiect; the <HI>purity</HI> of <HI>loue;</HI> which
produceth this admirable effect: it makes one soule
rule two hearts, and one heart dwell in two bodies.
Now, I would haue you, when your desires are
drawne to this period; to become so taken with the
loue of your choyce, as to interpret whatsoeuer hee
shall doe, euer to the best sense. It were little enough
that you retained a good opinion of him, who stands
in so many seuerall ingagements obliged for you.
Should your riot bring him into debt; his restraint
must make you free. <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rance</HI> must be his suit, while
better stuffe makes you a Coate. Yea, what Consci|ence
is there in it, but hee should receiue an affable
and amiable respect from you; seeing, if your <HI>Con|sci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nce</HI>
be no <HI>Conformalist,</HI> he must pay for you?</P>
<P>These respects should perpetually tye you, to ho|nour
him, who becomes so <HI>legally</HI> ty'd for you. Re|quite
these then with constancy, and retaine this en|suing
Example euer in your memory. <HI>Theogena,</HI> wife
to <HI>Agathocles,</HI> shew'd admirable constancy in her
husbands greatest misery, shewing her selfe most his
owne, when he was relinquisht and forsaken of his

<P>Conforme your selues to this <HI>Mirr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">r,</HI> and

<P>Now, that we may vse the method of Art; to cure
the <HI>effect,</HI> is to take away the <HI>cause:</HI> my purpose
shall bee first to discouer those incendiaries or fo|ments
of this inordinate passion, or intoxicating
poyson; secondly, the effects arising from them;
lastly, the cure or remedy of them.</P>
<P>For the first, wee may very properly reduce the
prime grounds of this <HI>wanton fancy,</HI> or <HI>wandring
<PB N="139" REF="93">
frenzy</HI> to a Catalogue included in these two verses:
<Q><L>^1Sloth, ^2Words, ^3Books, ^4Eyes, ^5Consorts, &amp; ^6luscious fare,</L>
<L>The Lures of lust, and sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nes of honour are,</L></Q></P>
<P>On euery of which particular to insist, would en|large
this <HI>branch</HI> too much; we will onely poynt at
them and so leaue them. For the first, sententious
<HI>Seneca</HI> saith, he had rather endure the vtmost of for|tunes
extremitie, than subiect himselfe to <HI>Sloth</HI> or
<HI>Sensuality.</HI> For it is this only, which maketh of men,
women; of women, beasts; of beasts, monsters.
This then is to be shunned, if the reward of vertue
be to be shared. Secondly, <HI>Words</HI> corrupt the dispo|sition;
they set an edge or glosse on depraued Liber|ty:
making that member offend most, when it
should be imployed in profiting most. The tongue is
more effectuall than any Letter; let it be then so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">m|ployed,
as it may improue the hearer. Thirdly, <HI>Books</HI>
treating of light subiects, are Nurseries of wanton|nesse:
they instruct the loose Reader to become
naught, whereas before, touching naughtines<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e he
knew naught. A story of the rape of <HI>Ganimedes,</HI> or
of light <HI>Lais</HI> in <HI>Eurypedes,</HI> are their daily L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ctures.
<HI>Plato</HI>'s Diuine Philosophy, or <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> pious Pre|cepts
Morality, must va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">le to <HI>Alcaeus,</HI> or <HI>Anacre|ons</HI>
wanton Poesie. <HI>Venus</HI> and <HI>Adon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> are vnfitting
Consorts for a Ladies bosome. Remoue them time|ly
from you, if they euer had entertainment by you
left, like the <HI>Snake</HI> in the fable, they annoy you.
Fourthly, <HI>Eyes</HI> are those <HI>Windowes</HI> by which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
enters; your inward house cannot shine, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
these be shut; Obiects they haue of more beauty to

shee co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ted, coueting shee tasted, tasting she peri|shed.
Thus aspiring to the knowledge of good and
<PB N="140" REF="94">
euill, became to her and her posterity euill. The <HI>Eye</HI>
is a <HI>Liuing glasse,</HI> but if wee make it a <HI>false glasse,</HI> it
will neither represent vs truly, nor discouer our ble|mishes
freely; but make that seeme faire which is o|dious
and vgly. By this meanes, many good ob|iects
become <HI>Eye-soares</HI> vnto vs, which, if clearely
viewed, would like a soueraigne <HI>Eye-bright,</HI> restore
sight vnto vs. Fifthly, <HI>Consorts</HI> are theeues of time,
they will rob you of opportunity, the best treasure
time can afford you, if you suffer them to incroach
on you and abuse you. Chuse such then for your
<HI>Consorts,</HI> of whom you may haue assured hope, that
they will either better you, or bee bettered by you.
Chuse such, whom you may admire both when you
see them and heare them: when you see their liuing
Doctrine, and heare their wholesome instruction.
Lastly, <HI>Luscious fare</HI> is the fuell of euery inordinate
concupiscence. Nothing so much feeds it, nor insen|sates
the vnderstanding by delighting in it. By re|straint
of this, you shall learne to moderate your de|sires.
Whence you may reioyce, yet in him, who is
your ioy, if you can liue sparingly, and embrace the
meanes that may chastise in you all sensuality: for by
your spare life is lust extinguished, vertue nourished,
the minde strengthened, the vnderstanding to hea|uenly
things raysed. Yea, abstinence auaileth much
for preseruing health of body and length of life.
Whence it is said: <HI>He that di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">teth himselfe, prolongeth
life.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccles. 37. 30.</NOTE> Which the profound <HI>Stagirian</HI> confirmes in
these words: <HI>To abstaine from riot and superfluity, is
the soueraign'st prescription or physicke for the body.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist dereg. Princ.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now to descend to the second <HI>branch</HI> of our diui|sion
in this <HI>Obseruation;</HI> wee might here enumerate
those many odious and inhumane effects, which haue
and doe daily arise from the violence of this <HI>Wanton
fancy</HI> or <HI>Wandring frenzy;</HI> and what tragicke euents
<PB N="141" REF="94">
it hath in all times produc'd: but they would seeme
relations too full of horror to your modest and time|rous
Natures. Onely let mee tell you, if you desire
to be satisfied in subiects of that kinde, our <HI>Italian</HI>
Stories will afford you variety: Where indiscreet
Loue clozeth her dolefull Scene with so miserable an
<HI>Exit,</HI> as no Pencill can expresse any picture to more
life, than an historicall line hath drawne out the web
of their miseries. So as, that ancient Adage might
seeme verified: That from slaues and miserable peo|ple
God hath taken away the one halfe of their <HI>vn|derstanding.</HI></P>
<P>Now to cure this desperate malady (though to you
the cure, I hope, be needlesse, being free from all such
violent distempers;) the best and soueraignst receit
is to fortifie the weaknes of your sexe with strength
of resolution; that, with incessant deuotion. Be not
too liberall in the bestowing of your fauors; nor too
familiar in publike conuerse. Presume not too much
on the strength of a weake Fort. Make a Contract
with your eyes not to wander abroad, lest they bee
catch'd in comming home. Treat not of loue too
freely; play not wagges with the blinde boy; hee
has a dangerous ayme, though he hath no eyes. Sport
not with him, that may hurt you; play not with
him, that would play on you. Your Sports will turne
to an ill iest, when you are wounded in earnest: the
<HI>Fly</HI> may be then your Embleme:
<Q><L>So long the foolish <HI>Fly</HI> playes with the flame,</L>
<L>Till her light wings are cinged in the same.</L></Q></P>
<P>Fly to an higher Sphere: you are yet vntouch'd;
this <HI>wandring frenzy</HI> hath neuer yet surpriz'd you;
preuent the meanes, and it shall neuer inuade you.
Be not such foes to your selues, as to purchase your
owne disquiet. Examples you haue of all sorts, both
to allure and deterre you. Pure loue admits no staine.

Continuance of time, with discontinuance of his

there seated, where it may be more sweetly sea|soned.</P>
<P>THere be <HI>Haggards</HI> of that wilde Nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How <HI>Fancy</HI> may be che<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|red if too cold.</NOTE> as they
will by no meanes be reclaim'd; Neither Loue
nor feare will cause them stoope to any Lure. Em|blemes
these are to such wayward Girles, whose in|flexible
natures will neither be woo'd nor wonne at
any rate. These had rather dye for loue, than bee
deem'd to loue. Their hearts are smeer'd ouer with
<HI>Salamanders oyle,</HI> and will admit no heat. They may
entertaine Suiters, but it is with that coldnesse of af|fection,
as the longer they resort, the lesser is their
hope. They may boast more of the multiplicity of
their Suitors, than their Suitors can of any probabili|ty
to be speeders. As it chanced sometime in a Con|test
betwixt two Maids, who comparing one with
the other their descents, friends, and Suitors:
<Q><HI>Make no comparison with me,</HI> replyed the one to the
other, <HI>for I must tell thee, I haue more Suitors than thou
hast friends, More shamelesse you</HI> (answered the o|ther)
<HI>vnlesse you meane to set vp an house of good fel|lowship.</HI></Q>
These vnsociable Natures, who many times
deferre making their choyce, till age bring them to
contempt, and excludes them from all choyce, Or
<HI>Dana&euml;</HI>-like, liue immured in their Chamber, til their
Fort be vndermined by some <HI>golden</HI> Pioner; detract
much from the relenting disposition of their Sexe.
It is their honor to be woo'd &amp; won. To be discreet
in their <HI>choyce,</HI> and to entertaine their <HI>choyce</HI> without
<HI>Change.</HI> Of such I speake, who haue not dedicated
their dayes to Virginity; which is such a Conditi|on,
as it aspires to an Angelicall perfection. Good,
(saith venerable <HI>Bede</HI>) is coniugall chastity, better
<PB N="147" REF="97">
is viduall continency, but best is the perfection of
Virginity. Yea, Virginity exceeds the condition of
humane nature, being that, by which man resembles
an Angelicall Creature. Wee reade likewise, that the
<HI>Vnicorne,</HI> when he can be taken by no force nor sub|till
Engine, will rest and repose in the Lap of a Vir|gin.</P>
<P>To those onely I direct my discourse, who haue
a mind to take themselues vnto the world, and to en|tertaine
their <HI>Louer:</HI> but it is with such coolenesse,
as it driues their dispassionate <HI>Sweet-hart</HI> into strange
extremes. And this proceeds commonly from an
ouer-weening Conceit, which these dainty Dam|sels
haue of their owne worth: with the apprehen|sion
whereof they become so infinitely taken, as
they can finde none worthy their choyce. Of this
disdainefull opinion was that vnhappy Gentlewo|man,
who after many faire fortunes tendred, Sui|tors
of deseruing quality reiected, made her incestu|ous
brother her licentious louer.</P>
<P>A crime detestable euen to Barbarians and bruit
beasts. Insomuch as, it is reported of the <HI>Camell,</HI>
that they vsually hood-winke him, when at any
time they bring his mother vnto him; which act he
no sooner knowes, than hee tramples her vnder his
feet, and kickes her to death with his heeles; so hate|full
is Incest euen to bruit beasts, whose natiue in|stinct
abhorres such obscene commi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tures. You,
whose discreet affections haue cast anchor, by ma|king
choyce of some deseruing Louer; afflict him
not with needlesse delayes; if he merit your choyce,
one day is too long to deferre him; if vndeseruing,
taxe your owne indiscretion to rashly to entertaine
him.</P>
<P>Is it bashfull modesty that with-holds you? I com|mend
it; it well becomes you. Chastity cannot ex|presse
<PB N="148" REF="98">
it selfe in a fairer Character, than in blushing
lines of louing shame fastnesse. Is it consent of friends
that detaines you? I approue that too; These rites
are best accomplished, when they are with consent
and consort of friends solemnized. But if the ground
of your delay trench either vpon some future ex|pectance
of better fortunes; or indifferency of
affection in respect of your Choyce: the issue can|not
possibly proue well, being built vpon such
weake grounds. For, to insist cursorily vpon either
of these two; Shall a deceiuing hope of preferre|ment
dispossesse him of your heart, whom personall
deserts make worthy of your loue? Looke to it;
Such fortunes cannot purchase you content, which
are got with an aged husbands contempt. It shewes
a seruile nature, to cashiere a faithfull Louer, because
he is poorer; and to preferre another lesse desertfull,
because hee is richer. This inconstancy cannot suc|ceed
well, because the foundation is grounded ill.</P>
<P>Againe, are you indiff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rent or Luke-warme in af|fection;
in respect of your choyce? for shames sake,
what doe you make of loue? Doe you vse it like a
toy or tyre to put off or on as you like? Must it re|semble
the fashion? This day in request, and next
day out of date? This, indeed, is such a coole and
easie-tempered Loue, as it will neuer mad you; yet,
trust me, it may well delude you. <HI>Fancy</HI> will not so be
playd with. You will obiect, I imagine, your sto|macks
are too queasie to digest Loue. Why then did
you euer seeme so greedily to feed on that, which
your stomackes now cannot well digest? Haue you
surfetted on the <HI>substance?</HI> Lay that aside for a while,
and bestow your eye on the <HI>Picture.</HI> Such impressi|ons
haue sharpened the dull affections of many Lo|uers.</P>
<P><HI>Alexander</HI> being much in loue with <HI>Apelles,</HI> as
<PB N="149" REF="98">
one highly rapt with the exquisitenesse of his art,
proposed him that Modell for a taske, which hee of
all others, affected most; commanding him on a
time to paint <HI>Campaspe,</HI> a beautifull woman, naked;
which <HI>Apelles</HI> hauing done, such impression wrought
the <HI>Picture</HI> in his affection, as <HI>Apelles</HI> fell in loue with
her, which <HI>Alexander</HI> perceiuing, gaue him her. It
is incredible, what rare effects were sometimes
drawne from a <HI>Morian-Picture,</HI> being onely hung
vp in a Ladies Chamber. If such impressiue motiues
of affection draw life from a <HI>Picture,</HI> what may bee
conceiued by the <HI>Substance? Oris Apollo</HI> writeth, that
the Egyptians, when they would describe the heart,
&amp; fit her with a proper Embleme, paint the bird <HI>Ibis:</HI>
because they thinke that no Creature, for proportion
of the body, hath so great an heart as the <HI>Ibis</HI> hath.</P>
<P>It is the <HI>Bird of loue</HI> must be the Embleme of your
heart. It is neither picture nor posture can content
her. Much lesse these <HI>inferiour pictures,</HI> which we call
<HI>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">neyes:</HI> which are so farre from satisfying the affe|ction,
as they are onely for the Mold or Worldling:
whose grosser thoughts neuer yet aspired to the
knowledge of loues definition. As then, the precious
stone <HI>Diacletes,</HI> though it haue many rare and excel|lent
soueraignties in it, yet it loseth them all, if it be
put in a dead mans mouth: so <HI>Loue,</HI> though it bee a
subiect so pure, as none of a more refined nature; so
firm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">, as none of a more holding temper; so hot, as
none of a more lasting feruour: yet becomes her
splendour darkened, her vigor weakened, her feruor
cooled, when she is in a cold brest entertained. Re|semble,
rather, the <HI>Iuniper-tree,</HI> whose coale is the
hottest, and whose shadow is the coolest: be hot in
your <HI>affection,</HI> but coole in your <HI>passion.</HI> If you finde
any thing which cooleth loue in you, remoue it; if
any thing which vrgeth passion, quench it: contra|riwise,
<PB N="150" REF="99">
feed in you loues heat; but represse in you all
passionate hate. Take into your more serious thoghts,
a view of his deserts whom you affect: increase the
conceit of them by supposing more than hee expres|seth.
The imagination of <HI>Loue</HI> is strong, and works
admirable effects in a willing subiect. Yet in all this,
let not one straid thought wrong your Mayden-mo|desty
so much, as to suggest to you a straine of light|nesse:
Other Closet-treaties you may entertaine
safely and freely, without touch of modesty. As to
thinke of the <HI>honour</HI> of that <HI>State,</HI> to which you are
approaching; the mutuall Comfort from that my|sterious
vnion arising; how griefes will be attempe|red
by one anothers suffering; how ioyes will bee
augmented by one anothers sharing. These thoughts
cannot but well become you; nor otherwise chuse
than with a pure affection inflame you; nor receiue
lesse than free acceptance from you.</P>
<P>Thus may that Loue, which seem'd before to
haue beene as <HI>chilled,</HI> by these modest motiues bee
<HI>cheered.</HI> That day no blacke Cloud should by right
sit on your faire brow; no cold dampe seaze on your
heart. You haue got one whom a sacred gage hath
made yours; with a cheerefull requitall render your
selfe his. This cannot choose but highly please the
pure eye of heauen, to see that <HI>Mysterie</HI> so sweetly
solemniz'd, which was honoured by Christ, with his
first Miracle on Earth.</P>
<P>IN this last branch of our <HI>Obseruation,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">An attempe|rament of both.</NOTE> wee are to
propose an <HI>attemperament</HI> of both those indispo|sed
<HI>Fancies</HI> before mentioned, and deseruedly taxed.
First, the <HI>wildenesse</HI> of the one; secondly, the <HI>coolenesse</HI>
of the other: by seasoning them both with an indif|ferent
<HI>temper&punc;</HI></P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="99">
In a <HI>Vine,</HI> wild and luxurious branches are to bee
pruned, that such as are free and kindly may bee bet|ter
cherished. In the spirituall field of your heart, is
neuer to be expected any fruitfull increase of vertues,
till there be weeded out of it all the thornes of vices.
The difference betwixt a <HI>Wise</HI> and <HI>wilde</HI> Loue, is this:
the one euer deliberates before it loue; the other
loues before it deliberate. The first question that she
askes, who <HI>wisely</HI> loues: <Q>Is he, who is here recom|mended
to my choyce, of good repute? Is he rich
in the endowments of his minde?</Q> Next question
shee askes, are of a lower siege: <Q>May his perso|nage
giue content? Are his fortunes such, as may
not beget in loue a contempt?</Q> Thus beginnes shee
that loues <HI>wisely,</HI> with goods inward, and ends with
outward; whereas, shee that loues <HI>wildly,</HI> beginnes
with outward, and ends, or else neuer remembers the
inward: <Q>Is hee, you tender to mee, of promising
personage? Is hee neat in his cloathes? Complete
in his dresse? Can he Court mee in good words?
and perfume them with sweet protests? Can hee
vsher me gracefully in the street? and in his very
pace expresse a reserued state?</Q> Next question shee
askes, must be neare the same verge: <Q>Is he rich in
Manors? Hath not fortune made him a younger
brother? Can he, to buy himselfe honour, pawne
the Long-acre? May his swelling meanes furnish
me of Coach, Caroach, and daily fit mee for some
<HI>Exchange</HI> trifles? I haue a moneths mind to see the
man!</Q> Hee cannot but deserue my loue. Wherein
shee sayes well, for in very deed hee could deserue
little else. Now as the <HI>former,</HI> seldome bestowes her
selfe, but where shee findes content; so the <HI>latter,</HI>
seldome or neuer, but either she with her Choyce, or
her Choyce with her falls into contempt. The rea|son
is, this <HI>wilde</HI> Girle neuer cares for more than to
<PB N="152" REF="100">
be married. If she may but see that day, it accompli|sheth
her content: though shee haue but one Comi|call
day all her life. Yea, it is as well as can be expe|cted
from her hands, if she attaine that <HI>style</HI> without
some apparant <HI>soile.</HI> Such as these I could wish, to pre|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ent
the worst, they were married betime, lest they
marre themselues before time. Albeit, moderate re|straint,
seasonable aduice (presupposing some seeds
of grace to worke on) haue wrought singular effects
in many of these <HI>wilde-ones,</HI> who afterwards became
graue and modest Matrons.</P>
<P>To you then, <HI>kind-hearts,</HI> am I to recommend some
necessary cautions, which carefully obserued, may
make you wiser than you thought of; and cause you
haue a tender care of that, which before you had ne|uer
mind of. Your brests are vnlock'd, your tongues
vnty'd; you cannot loue, but you must shew it; nor
conceiue a kinde thought, but you must tell it. The
<HI>Index</HI> of your <HI>hearts</HI> you carry both in your <HI>tongues</HI>
and <HI>eyes;</HI> for shame, learne <HI>silence</HI> in the one, and <HI>se|crecy</HI>
in the other. Will you giue power to an insul|ting
Louer, to triumph ouer your weakenesse; or
which is worse, to worke on the opportunity of
your Lightnesse? Doe not; rather ramme vp those
<HI>portells</HI> which betray you to your enemy, and preuent
his entry by your vigilancy. Keepe home and stray
not, lest by gadding abroad, you incurre <HI>Dinahs</HI> fate.
You haue Consorts of your owne sexe to passe time
withall; their society wil teach you to forget, what is
better forgot than kept. Let not a straid thought be|tray
your innocency. <HI>Checke</HI> your madding <HI>Fancy,</HI>
and if it vse resistance, curbe it with restraint. It will
doe excellently well, if you forbeare to resort to pla|ces
of publike meeting; till you haue drawne vp and
seal'd a Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">enant with your eyes, to see naught that
they may not lawfully couet. These, when they wan|der,
<PB N="153" REF="100">
they breed in the heart, a dangerous distemper.
Lastly, addresse your imployment euer to something
that is good; so shall your <HI>fantacy</HI> finde nought to
worke vpon that is ill. This shall afford you more li|berty,
than the whole worlds freedome can afford
you.</P>
<P>Now to you, <HI>Coy ones,</HI> whom either <HI>coldnesse</HI> of na|ture
hath benummed, or <HI>coynesse</HI> hath made subtill to
dissemble it. You can looke and like, and turne ano|ther,
way, where you like most. No obiect of loue
can take you, till it ouertake you. Be not wise too
much. True affection cannot endure such dissimulati|on.
Diuide not him, whom you loue, into such ex|tremes:
you may be modest, and spare a great deale
of this <HI>Coynesse;</HI> It is the rule of Charity to doe as
you would be done to. Now, would it content you
to be entertained with disdaine, where your deserts
merit acceptance? Rectifie this then on your selues,
which you would not haue done by another to your
selues. It is an ill requitall, to recompence fancy with
contempt, or constant loue with disdaine. This were
to incurre ingratitude, a vice so odious, as no age
could finde euer ought more vnciuilly impious. I do
not moue you to be too open-hearted, or if so, not too
liberally to expresse it; this were no discouery of
<HI>fancy,</HI> but <HI>folly.</HI> So conceale your loue, as your louer
may not despaire of all hope to obtaine your loue. In|different
Curtsies you may shew without lightnesse,
and receiue them too in lieu of thankfulnesse. I leaue
it to your discretion to distinguish times and places;
for these may either improue or impaire the oppor|tunity
of such like Curtsies.</P>
<P>Doe not immure your beauties, as if a iealousie of
your owne weaknesse had necessitated this restraint.
There can be no <HI>Conquest,</HI> where there is no <HI>Contest,</HI>
Conuerse with loue; conceit with your selues whom
<PB N="154" REF="101">
you could like. This your <HI>cooler</HI> temper may admit,
and st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">l retaine that liberty which is fit.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">alconers vse many meanes to make their Hawks
sharpe; they begin with short flights, till weathring
bring them to endure longer. <HI>Pigmalions</HI> image recei|ued
no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> life in all parts at once; first, it took warmth,
after that, vitall motion. Is loue <HI>coole</HI> in you? let a
kindly warmth heat that coldnesse. Is Loue <HI>dull</HI> in
you? let a liuely agility quicken that dulnesse. Is loue
<HI>coy</HI> in you? Let a louely affability supple that coy|nesse:
So, in short time, you may haue a full rellish
of loues sweetnesse.</P>
<P>Now wee come to the <HI>attemperament</HI> of these;
wherein we are to extract out of grosser mettals some
pure Oare, which wee must refine, before it can giue
any true beauty to this specious palace of loue. Draw
neare then, and attend to what of necessity you must
obserue; if euer you meane to deserue HER loue,
whom you are in Ciuility bound to serue.</P>
<P>In <HI>Sicilia</HI> there is a fountaine called <HI>Fons Solis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">p. Mela.</NOTE> out
of which at Mid-day, when the Sun is nearest, flow|eth
cold water; at Midnight, when the Sunne is far|thest
off, sloweth hot water. This should be the liue|ly
Embleme of your state (<HI>Gentlewomen:</HI>) who, now
after those cooler vapours of your frozen affection
dispersed, those lumpish and indisposed humors di|spelled,
and those queasie risings of your seeming <HI>coy|nesse,</HI>
dispossessed; haue felt that chaste amorous fire
burne in you, which will make you of shamefaste
Maids, modest Matrons. When the heat of passion is
at Mid-day, I meane his full height, with those, to
whom faith hath engag'd you, and loue, before the
hostage of that faith, confirm'd you; then are you to
resemble the quality of that fountaine, by flowing
with <HI>col<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> water</HI> of discretion and sweet temper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Explana|tion of the Embleme.</NOTE> to
allay that heat; lest it weaken those you loue, by gi|uing
<PB N="155" REF="101">
way to passion, which patience cannot chuse but
loath. Againe, when heat is farthest off, and proui|dence
begins to labour of a lethargy; when seruants
remit their care, neglect their charge, and the whole
family grow out of order, through the coldnesse of a
remisse Master; resemble then that fountaine, by
flowing with <HI>hot water;</HI> win and weane these whom
loue and loyalty haue made yours, with warme con|iugall
teares, to compassionate their neglected estate,
and by timely preuention to auert the fate of impro|uident
husbands.</P>
<P>Or thus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Another pro|per applicati|on of this Embleme.</NOTE> if you please, may you make your selues
gracious Emblemes of that fountaine: Doth the Sun
shine at Mid-day, and in his fullest height on you? Do
the beams of prosperity reflect brightly on you? Flow
with <HI>cold water;</HI> allay this your heat and height of
prosperity, with some cooling thoughts of aduersi|ty,
lest prosperity make you forget both the Author
of it, and in the end how to bestow it. Againe, doth
the Sunne shine farthest off you? Doth not one small
beameling of prosperous successe cheere you? Flow
with <HI>hot water;</HI> vanquish aduersity with resolution
of temper. Desist not from labour, because fortune
seconds not your endeuour. To conclude, as your <HI>wild
fancy</HI> (if you were euer surpriz'd of any) is now re|ctifi'd;
your <HI>coolenesse</HI> heatned; your <HI>coynesse</HI> bani|shed;
so conforme your selues to them, whom <HI>one
heart</HI> hath made one with you, as no Clowd of aduer|sity
may looke so blacke, no beame of prosperity
shine so cleare, wherein you may not with an e|quall
embrace of both estates, beare your share.</P>

all those our <HI>Ancestors,</HI> who for so many preceding

His Kinsfolkes hee could not much boast of,
they were such inferiour Creatures; no strutters in

<P>Let me now reflect vpon you, <HI>Gentlewomen,</HI> whose

both in life and death.</P>
<P>Are you nobly descended? Ennoble that descent
with true desert. Doe not thinke that the priuilege
of greatnesse, can bee any subterfuge to guiltinesse.
Your more ascending honour requires more than a
Common lustre. In places of publike resort you chal|lenge
precedency, and it is granted you. Shall the
highest place haue the least inward grace? No; let
not a word fall from you, that may vnbeseeme you.
Others are silent when you discourse; let it be worth
their attention; lest a presumption of your owne
worth draw you into some friuolous excursion.
There is not an accent which you vtter, a sentence
you deliuer, any motion in your carriage or gesture,
which others eye not, and eying assume not. Your
Retinue is great; your family gracious; your acti|ons
should be the life of the one, and line of directi|on
to the other. To see a light Lady descending from
a noble Family, is a Spectacle of more spreading in|famy,
than any subiect of inferiour quality. I cannot
approue of this Apish kinde of formality, which
many of our better sort vse; it detracts from their
<HI>descent,</HI> to make <HI>affectation</HI> their <HI>Tutresse.</HI> They were
free-borne; nothing then that is seruile can become
them. It is nothing to retaine the fauour or feature
of your <HI>Ancestors,</HI> and to estrange you from that
which truly dignifi'd your <HI>Ancestors.</HI></P>
<P>Vertues haue more liuing Colours, and are secon|ded
<PB N="160" REF="104">
with more lasting honours than any outward
beauties. You deceiue your selues, if you thinke that
honour receiued her first life from descent; no, It
was <HI>demerit</HI> that made <HI>descent</HI> capable of honour. A
Pedigree argues your <HI>Gentility:</HI> but had not some de|seruing
action beene, you had neuer attained to any
noble Pedigree. For <HI>Gentility</HI> is not to be measured
by antiquity of time, but precedency in worth. If
brackish or troubled water seldome come from a pure
Spring; wild and vnsauory fruit from a good tree;
whence is it, that noble Predecessors, whose pure
blood was neuer corrupted with any odious staine,
should bring forth such degenerating scienes? Sure|ly,
this generally proceeds from the too much liber|ty
that is granted to our youth; whose inclinations,
though otherwise good and equally disposed, are v|sually
by <HI>Custome,</HI> which becomes a <HI>Second nature,</HI>
miserably depraued. Society they affect, and this in|fects
them; repaire to publike places they admit,
and this corrupts them. Those eminent examples
which their Noble Progenitors left them, become
buried with them. They comply with the time;
<HI>Vertue</HI> (they say) can hardly subsist, where <HI>Vice</HI> is in
highest request. What though <HI>Plato</HI> aduise them to
make choyce of the best way of liuing, which may
be easily effected by assiduate vse and daily custome:
they haue learned to inuert his rule, by affecting that
custome most, which tends to the practice of vertue
least. Besides, there is another reason which may be
probably alleaged, why <HI>generous descents</HI> become so
much corrupted; and vertuous Parents by vitious
Children so frequently seconded. Our Nobler wo|men,
though in other respects truly imitable, and
for their vertuous Conuersation admirable; come
short in one peculiar duty, which euen Nature exacts
of them, and which being duely perform'd, would,
<PB N="161" REF="104">
doubtlesly, no lesse enable and ennoble them who
are descended from them, than any particular, were
it neuer so powerfull, that could informe them. These
which are mothers by generation, are seldome their
Nurcing-mothers by education. No maruell then,
if they degenerate, when they partake of the natures
of other women. Though their owne mothers blood
streame through their veines, a strangers milke must
feed them, which makes them participate of their
<HI>nature,</HI> as they are fed with their <HI>substance.</HI> Where|soeuer
the Nurses milke is receiued, the Nurses man|ners
are likewise retained. Whence it was, that
<HI>Chrysippus</HI> expresly commanded that the very best
and wisest Nurses should be made choice of; that what
<HI>good blood</HI> had infused, might not by <HI>ill milke</HI> be infe|cted.
It was the ioynt aduice both of <HI>Plutarch</HI> and
<HI>Pha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">orine,</HI> that a mother should bee her childrens
Nurse: because, commonly, with the milke of the
Nurse, they sucke the quality or condition of her
life. Yea, according to ancient Decree, women were
bound to nurse their owne children, and not to ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e
any other women (vnlesse necessity enforc'd them) to
nurse them.</P>
<P>Let this then bee rectifi'd; yee, whose Noble de|scents
haue made you eminent in the eye of the
world; and whom Gods blessing hath made fruitfull
Mothers, to bring forth a faire and hopefull increase
vnto the world: nurse them with your owne milke;
this will expresse in you a motherly care<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> to them;
&amp; beget in them a greater measure of child-like loue
to you. Your care, the more it is parentall, will exact
of them a loue more faithfull and filiall. Nurse them,
I say, with the milke of your owne brests to feed
them; with the milke of your owne liues to informe
them. So shall their actions proue them to bee your
Successours; when they shall not onely <HI>deriue</HI> their
<PB N="162" REF="105">
blood from you, but on this Theatre of humane frail|ty,
shall publish themselues to be true <HI>representers</HI> of
you. For in vaine is your blood to them <HI>deriued,</HI> if
your memory by their vertues be not <HI>reuiued.</HI> Giue
them then that which may make them yours. Good|nesse
may bee blamed, but her succeeding memory
can neuer be blanch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d. Thus shall you not onely
shew your selues worthy of that <HI>house,</HI> from
whence you came, but after your period on earth,
bee receiu'd into a more glorious house in time to
come.</P>
<P>IT is not the Nobility of <HI>descent,</HI> but of <HI>vertues,</HI> that
makes any one a gracefull and acceptable Seruitour
in the Court of heauen. Houses are distinguished by
<HI>Coats</HI> and <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">sts;</HI> but these are dignifi'd by something
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">se.</P>
<P>In Heraldry those are euer held to be the best <HI>Coats,</HI>
that are deblazon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters"> with least charge.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vertue</HI> the best <HI>Coat.</HI></NOTE> Consequent|ly,
then must <HI>vertue</HI> needs be the <HI>best Coat.</HI> Shee re|quires
the least charge, in her attire, shee is not
sumptuous; in her fare, delicious; nor in her re|tinue
(the more is the pitty) numerous. She confines
her desires vpon earth within a strait Circumfe|rence;
a very small portion of that mettall will con|tent
her. She sees none so great in the Court, as may
deserue her enuy; none so rich in the City, as may
beget in her an earthly desire; none so repos'd in
the Countrey, as to induce her to change her state.
Shee is infinitely happy, in that shee aymes at no o|ther
happinesse, than where it is to bee found. Am|bition
may display her Pie-colour'd flagge; but shee
will neuer get <HI>vertue</HI> to be her follower: Her desires
are pitcht vpon a farre more transcendent honour,
than these <HI>State-corriuals</HI> on earth can ere afford her;
<PB N="163" REF="105">
or by their competition take from her. Pleasure may
cast out her Lure, but <HI>vertue</HI> is so high a flyer, as shee
scornes to stoupe to ought vnworthy of her: it plea|seth
her to contemplate that on earth, which she is
to enioy in heauen. Profit may seeke to vndermine
her; but all her pollicie cannot worke on <HI>vertues</HI> con|stancy.
Content is her Crowne; Contempt of the
world, her care; what worldlings seeke, she shuns;
whence it is, that her beauty, in the darkest Night of
aduersity, shines. In a word, shee is an absolute
Commandresse of her selfe; and easie is it to haue
that Command, where no turbulent passions labour
to contend.</P>
<P>Farre otherwise is it with those, who be they ne|uer
so <HI>generously</HI> descended, popularly graced, nor
powerfully guarded, yet being not adorned with this
<HI>Crest,</HI> distinguished by this <HI>Coat,</HI> they can neither
enioy freedome within, nor safe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">y without.</P>
<P><HI>Lewis</HI> the eleuenth had a conceit, which, no doubt,
proceeded from his m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lancholicke and indisposed
humour, that euery thing did stinke about him; all
the odoriferous perfumes, or fragrant sauours they
could get, would not ease him, but still he smelled a
filthy st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ke. So fares it with them, whose corrupt
hearts, like musty vessells, not throughly seasoned
with <HI>vertue,</HI> fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d forth no other smell than what is
most distastefull to a pure and well-disposed minde.
Now, there bee many, who make an outward sem|blance
of conscience; and promise to the world ap|parant
arguments of their vprightnesse; whose in|ward
Cells, like corrupt Charnell-houses, afford no|thing
but filthinesse. Y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">a, these, to make the world
more confident of their s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nctity, will not sticke to
condemne themselues, dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">value their owne worth,
and rank them amongst the vnworthiest that breath
on earth. Yet, though they disprayse themselues be|fore
<PB N="164" REF="106">
others, they cannot endure to bee dispraysed by
others. Whereof we read one excellent example to
this purpose: There was a certaine woman, who
had taken her selfe to a Cloyster-life, and seemed ve|ry
deuout; so as shee vsually said to her Confessor,
who came often vnto her, to heare her Confession,
and partake of her Deuotion: <Q><HI>Good father, pray vnto
the Lord for mee; for I am a woman so euill, yea, euen
so vtterly nought, as I much feare left the Lord punish
others for my sinnes.</HI> Vpon this, the Priest out of a
discreet zeale, desired to try whether there were
in her the foundation of true humility or no. Next
time therefore, that shee vttered the like words
vnto him, saying; <HI>That shee was the very worst of all
women;</HI> the Priest forthwith answered: <HI>I haue of|ten
times at many hands beard thus much of thee before
this.</HI> Whereat she being presently incensed, replyed:
<HI>You lye in your throat: And whosoeuer hath told you, or
reporteth such things of mee, are all lyers.</HI> To attemper
which immoderate passion, the Priest humbly re|turned
her this answer: <HI>Now I perceiue thy pride and
hypocrisie; for as much as thou speakest that of thy selfe,
which thou disdainest any other should speake of thee.
And this is no signe of true humility, but of inward pride
and grosse hypocrisie.</HI></Q></P>
<P>These dissembled, be they neuer so assiduate, sem|blances,
are no colours for <HI>Vertues crest.</HI> They must
be dyed in graine, or they will not hold. These, who
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">xpresse modesty in their outward carriage, are
good examples to those that consort with them; yet
if their priuate Parler be a witnesse of their dishonor,
they deface the figure of goodnesse in themselues.
<HI>Vertue</HI> consists note in seeming, nor piety in appearing
but practising. What is it to bee outwardly retyred
from the world, and inwardly affianced to the world?
How are those women in <HI>Turkie</HI> affected, that most
<PB N="165" REF="106">
part of the yeare come not abroad? Those <HI>Italian</HI> and
<HI>Spanish</HI> Dames, that are mewed vp like Hawks, and
lockt vp by their iealous husbands? This is such an
enforced restraint, as it many times begets loose de|sires
in the restrained. It is the preuention of occasi|on
that crownes vs. More prayse-worthy were those
women of <HI>Sio,</HI> could they confine their actions with|in
the bounds of modesty, than these restrained Li|bertines.
For those Iland Women, as they are the
beautifull'st Dames of all the Greekes, so haue they
more liberty granted by their auaricious husbands,
than all the Dames in Greece. For their wiues pro|stitution
is their promotion. So as, when they see
any stranger or promising factor arriue, they will
presently demand if he would haue a Mistris: which,
for want of better supply, they mercenarily ten|der
him in the person of their owne wiues: so wil|ling
are they to weare the lasting Badge of infamy,
for base lucre or commodity.</P>
<P>It is not then an enforced moderation of our affecti|ons,
that deserues the stile of goodnesse. Wee are to
enioy freedome in our desires, and ouer those a noble
Conquest, if we merit the name of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">rtuous.</HI></P>
<P>Come then, <HI>Gentlewomen,</HI> you see what <HI>Coat</HI> will

<L>And haue no <HI>gen'rous vertues,</HI> is a scorne.</L></Q></P>
<P>Let it be your highest scorne, to stoupe to any base
thought. It is not priority nor precedency of place,
but propriety and proficiency in grace that makes an
honourable Soule. That Cloath is of most worth
that weares best; and that fashion of most esteeme
that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lds longest in request. <HI>Vertue</HI> is right <HI>Sempi|ternum</HI>
for weare; and of that complete fashion, as

Make choice of this stuffe then to suite you, of this

those that serue her; harbour those that flye for

stand in defence of her honour. There is nothing can

Retaine those diuine impressions of goodnesse in you,
that may truly ennoble you: display your <HI>gentility</HI>

<P>PAinters are curious in the choice of their colors,
lest their Art become blemished, through those
decaied colours, wherewith their Pictures are por|trayed.
Some are of opinion, that the receit of Pain|ting
or Colouring the substance of glasse through, is
vtterly lost; neither that these late succeeding times
can regaine, as yet, that mysterious perfection. Farre
more is it to be doubted, lest <HI>vertue,</HI> which we haue
proued by infallible arguments to be the best <HI>Coat,</HI>
want her true colour, and consequently become de|priued
of her chiefe lustre. Some Pictures, I know,
will doe well in white; yet it is colour that giues
them life, Beauty neuer darts more loue to the eye,
nor with quicker conuoy directs it to the heart, then
when it displayes her guiltlesse shame in a crimson
blush. There is <HI>one flower</HI> to be loued of women,

this is a <HI>good red,</HI> which is shamefastnesse.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A shamefaste+red the best Colour to de|blazon <HI>ver|tues Coat.</HI></NOTE> These

Picture could enforce such affection in a knowing
Commander, what effects may we thinke will a li|uing
substance produce? Truth is, there is such sweet
and amiable correspondence betwixt <HI>vertuous</HI> beau|ty,
and <HI>shamefaste</HI> modesty, as the one cannot subsist
without the others society. Not a light passage can
want the attendance of a blush, whilest modesty is in
presence. Yea, though shee be not conscious of any
conceit, that might beget in her face a shamefaste
blush; out of a modest Compassion shee will not
sticke to blush, when she obserues ought in another,
deseruing blame. Her eares glow at any light re|port;
which, lest they should grow too credulous,
shee fortifies with reason, to oppose the too easie en|trance
of suspition. Shee partakes of no resemblance
lesse than that of the <HI>Chameleon,</HI> whose naturall pro|perty
it is to represent all Colours saue white. She is
a milde and moderate interpretor of others actions;
but a serious Censor of her owne. Light discourses,
which tend rather to the deprauing of the hearer,
than ministring any vsefull subiect to an attentiue
Obseruer, she excludes; vnciuill Complement shee
abhorres; what onely is modest she approues; and
seconds her approuement with a gracefull smile. She
holds an infected minde to be more dangerous than
an infected house: such Company shee shunnes, on
whom the rayes of <HI>vertue</HI> seldome or neuer shine.
There is not that Condition, bee it neuer so meane,
<PB N="169" REF="108">
which shee cannot with cheerefulnesse entertaine:
so as, shee holds outward pouerty the best enricher
of an inward family. Her desires are so equally poy|zed,
as shee neither seekes more than shee enioyes,
nor wants freedome to dispose of what she enioyes.
Honour shee affects, yet with no such eagernesse, as
to hazzard the losse of a dearer honour, for so vncer|taine
a purchase. Friends and fauourites she admits,
and with that constancy, as it neither repents her of
accepting, nor them of tendring such vertuous fruits
of amity.</P>
<P>Here you haue her, <HI>Gentlewomen,</HI> who will
tell you, and in her selfe exemplifie what shee tells
you; that <HI>modesty</HI> is the choycest ornament that can
adorne you. Now if you purpose to trace her path,
or conforme your selues to her line; you must worke
on your affections, to embrace what shee loues, and
reiect whatsoeuer she loathes. Are you conuersant at
any time with such <HI>protesting seruants,</HI> as make deepe
Oaths meere Complements; and whose tongues are
witty Orators in running descant on a wanton Tale?
These are such Consorts as <HI>Modesty</HI> would be loath
to conuerse with. She can neuer endure any of these
discourses without an angry blush. Should you de|light
in these, you should quickly heare her out of a
vertuous passion, cry out with the Poet:
<Q><L>O Age! most of our women know not now,</L>
<L>What 'ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> to blush, till <HI>painting</HI> tell them how.</L></Q></P>
<P>Againe, should you entertaine in your naked bo|somes,
what some wantons haue too much affected,
light amorous Poems; perusing them with no lesse
Content, than if they had beene purposely penned to
worke on your Conceit; this cannot stand with
your <HI>modesty;</HI> These may corrupt you, but neuer
rectifie what is wandring in you. Suffer not a wan|ton
passage to play on your fantasie. Sinne would
<PB N="170" REF="109">
neuer enter in vpon you, if she found but a prepara|tion
of resistance in you. Tell me, what a sweet grace
conferres it on you, to mixe your salutes with mo|dest
blushes, and entertaine your Suitors with a
shamefaste bashfulnesse! Sure I am, where loue is
discreetly grounded, this cannot chuse but be an espe|ciall
motiue to affection. There may bee, I grant,
such <HI>wilde louers,</HI> who preferre the loose loue of an
inconstant <HI>Phaedra,</HI> before the chaste embraces of a
continent <HI>Antiope:</HI> but their indiscreet choyce is e|uer
seconded with a fearefull cloze. Those, who e|steeme
more of a painted cheeke, than a natiue blush,
shall finde all their imaginary happinesse resolued to
a painted blisse. It is <HI>Modesty</HI> and not <HI>Beauty</HI> which
makes the husband happy. Would you then deserue
the title of Chaste Virgins, constant Wiues, modest
Matrons? While you are ranked amongst the <HI>first,</HI>
conuerse not priuately with a wanton thought; send
not forth a wandring eye to fetch in a Sweet-heart.
Dis-value not your owne worth so much, as to wooe
others to become your Suitors. This would bee a
meanes rather to depresse loue, than increase it; im|payre
loue, than improue it. If you be worthy win|ning,
you cannot chuse but be worthy wooing. Meane
time, let not a straid looke betray your too forward
loue; nor a light conceit tax you of deserued reproofe.
Dye your cheeks with a Rosie blush, when you heare
ought that may detract from the <HI>modesty</HI> of your
Sexe. Be as silent as the night; your best Rhetoricke
consists in maiden blushes, and bashfull smiles; which
will worke more powerfully on a Louers heart, than
a Rhetoricall tongue, bee it neuer so curiously tipt
with Art.</P>
<P>For the <HI>second</HI> ranke; you know how strict a duty
is imposed on you; now are you not to conuerse with
strange loue: or suffer any other person haue the
<PB N="171" REF="109">
least share in your affection. To Court loue, or vse
any Complement, purposely to winne a priuate fa|uourite,
would detract as much from your honour,
as for a Souldier to flye from his Captaine, and ad|here
to a stranger. He hath inuested you in himselfe,
and ingaged himselfe yours by a sacred vow, which
death onely may reuerse: the dispersed loues which
you entertained before, must now be reduc'd to one,
and that but one, by whose mutuall choyce two are
indiuidually made one. A heart diuided cannot liue;
no more can the heat of diuided loue. You are now
so farre from entertaining any stranger; as you haue
vow'd with your heart, not to enter so much as any
treaty with an vniust intruder. It is dangerous to
conuerse with a profest foe, whose drift it is to vn|dermine
you; and such an one is euery loose louer,
who labours with the licentious art of adulterous
Oratory, to depriue you of that inestimable gemme,
which of all others, most adornes you.</P>
<P>For you that are <HI>Matrons;</HI> ripenesse of yeares
hath enioyned you to bid a lasting adew to the vani|ties
of youth. Now are you set as examples of gra|uity,
for others to imitate.</P>
<P>It were dotage in you now to begin to loue, when
your decay in Nature tels you, it is not long you are
to liue. You haue hitherto performed your parts
with a <HI>generous</HI> approuement of your actions, faile
not in the conclusion. This small remainder of
your declining pilgrimage, should be wholly dedi|cated
to the practice of goodnesse; that your pious
end may second your vertuous beginning. The Sunne
shines euer brighter at his setting than rising; so
should your life appeare better at your departing
than entring.</P>
<P>It were incomparably beneficiall for you, now in
this your <HI>Exit,</HI> to haue your affections seated in hea|uen,
<PB N="172" REF="110">
before you depart from earth: leauing some me|morable
examples of your wel-spent life, which may
eternize you after this li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e.</P>
<P>This will make your names flourish; and cause o|thers
in a vertuous emulation of your actions, to re|taine
your memory in thier liues. To bee briefe, be
you of what Condition soeuer, either in respect of
your age or state; there is nothing can better become
you than a modest shamefastnesse: which consists
either in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">uerting your eare from your owne prayse;
or with-drawing your presence from dishonest or
vnciuill discourse; or reiecting an importunate Sui|tor,
whose too inconsiderate entertainment might
question your honour. I haue noted in some women
a kind of zealous and deuout passion, when they
chanc'd but to heare any light or wanton communi|cation;
they could not hold but reproue them for
their impudence, and amidst their reproofe, to adorn
the Rosie Circlets of their cheekes with a blushing
shamefastnesse. Surely, this expressed a singular <HI>mo|desty</HI>
in them; which I would haue you (<HI>Gentlewomen</HI>)
in a serious imitation of them, to represent in your
selues. It will happen, many times, that you cannot
chuse but encounter with some frontlesse <HI>Buffoun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI>
whose highest straine of obscene wit, is to iustifie
some fabulous story, or repeat an vnciuill Tale; which
you are to entertaine with such disgust, as these odi|ous
relaters may gather by your Countenance, how
much you distaste such vnciuill discourse. For it is a
sweet kinde of euincing sinne, to discountenance it
with a modest shame.</P>
<P>Thus shall you make your very frowne an ingenu|ous
<HI>Index</HI> of your vncorrupt heart: and to adde one

of your guiltlesse shame in a Mayden blush, a Virgin-colour.</P>

She considers, how he, by whom our corrupt blood
was restored, our vnualuable losses repaired, and our
primitiue nakednesse compassionately couered, was
not with a Diadem crowned, nor in a stately bed
couched; yea, scarcely rather with one poore coat
couered: which he wore not as an ornament to his
body, to bestow on it trimnesse, but for necessity to
couer his nakednesse. What a pouerty is it then for
you, whose ancient descent promiseth something ex|traordinary
<PB N="175" REF="111">
in you, to haue nothing to boast of, saue
onely a gilded outside? It was Necessity that in|uented
Cloathes for you; now were it fit to pride
you in that, which depriu'd you of your prime beau|ty?
You shall obserue in many of our graue Matrons,
with what indifferency they attire themselues. Their
inward ornaments are their chiefest care; their re|newing
and repairing of them, their highest cure.
They haue found such choice flowers, as they afford
more spirituall delight to the soule, than any visible
flowers or odours doe to the smell. And what are
these, but diuine and morall precepts, soueraigne in|structions;
which haue taught them how to con|temne
earth, conquer death, and aspire vnto eterni|ty?
These by a continued custome or frequent con|uerse
with heauenly things, cannot now conceiue
any obiect to be worthy their beholding on earth.
Fashions may be worne about them, but little obser|ued
by them. The WEDDING GARMENT
is their desired raiment. This they make ready for
the Nuptiall day; the meditation whereof so trans|ports
them, as nothing below heauen can possesse
them. It is not beauty which they prize; for they
daily and duely consider the Prophets words,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioel. 2.</NOTE> <HI>All fa|ces

threats which God denounceth vpon beautifull, but

Which, howsoeuer it is, as one wittily ob|serues,

But the medicine was made for the wound, not

<P>Come then, <HI>Gentlewomen,</HI> beginne now at last to

These, who haue their <HI>iudgements</HI> in their

who haue their <HI>eyes</HI> in their <HI>heads,</HI> will onely
prize you by your inward worth. Were it not a

fashion to memorize your vanity after death? So
liue, that you may euer liue in the memory of the
good. It will not redound much to your honour, to
haue obserued the <HI>fashions</HI> of the time, but to haue re|deemed
your time; to haue dedicated your selues to
the practice of vertue all your time; to haue beene
Mirrors of modesty to your succeeding sexe; to haue
dis-valued the fruitlesse flourish of fading vanity, for
the promising hopes of a blessed eternity. Supply
then that in you, which bleered iudgements expect
without you. You challenge precedency in place, ex|presse
your selues worthy of that place. Vertue will
make you farre more honoured, than any garish ha|bit

derision, the other of true and <HI>generous</HI> approbation.
This you shall doe, if you season your desires with
discretion; if you temper your excursiue thoughts,
and bring them home with a serious meditation of
your approaching dissolution. It is said of the <HI>Palme</HI>

to apply ashes to the root of it, and it forthwith re|couers:
that the peacefull <HI>Palmes</HI> of your vertuous

some sweet and soueraigne meditation. That when

the Philosopher) in euery good man: and these will
finde time to expresse themselues.</P>
<P>It was <HI>Dauids</HI> testimony of himselfe: <HI>From my
youth vp haue I loued thy Law.</HI> An excellent preroga|tiue
giuen him, and with no lesse diligence improued
by him. Now these <HI>Natiue seeds,</HI> as they are diffe|rent,
so are the fruits which come of them, vari|ously
disposed. Some haue a rellish of true and <HI>gene|rous
bounty;</HI> wherein they shew that noble freedome
to their owne, in their liberality towards others: as
their very actions declare vnto the world, their com|mand
and soueraignty ouer the things of this world.
Others discouer their noble disposition, by their no|table
<HI>pilty</HI> and <HI>compassion;</HI> These will estrange them|selues
from no mans misery. If they cannot succour
him, they will suffer with him. Their bosomes are
euer open with pittifull <HI>Zenocrates,</HI> to receiue a di|stressed
one. Ouer a vanquish'd foe they scorne to
insult; or vpon a deiected one to triumph. They
haue teares to partake with the afflicted; and reall
expressions of ioy to share with the relieued. Others
shew apparant arguments of their singular <HI>modera|tion;</HI>
abstemious are these in their dishes; temperate
in their Companies; moderate in their desires. These
wonder at the rioters of this time; how they con|sume
their daies in sensuality and vncleannesse. Their
account is farre more straight; their expence more
strait; but their liberty of mind of an higher straine.
Cloathes they weare, but with that decency, as cu|riosity
cannot taxe them; meats they partake, but
with that temperance, as delicacy cannot tempt
them. Others from their Cradle, become braue
sparkes of <HI>valour;</HI> their very Childhood promiseth
vndoubted tokens of succeeding honour. These can|not
endure braues nor affronts. <HI>Generous</HI> resolution
hath stampt such deepe impressions in their heroicke
<PB N="179" REF="113">
mindes, as fame is their ayme; which they hunt af|ter,
with such constancy of spirit, as danger can nei|ther
amate them, nor difficulty auert them from
their resolues. Others are endued with a natural preg|nancy
of <HI>wit;</HI> to whom no occasion is sooner offe|red,
than some dainty expression must second it. O|thers
with more solidity of <HI>iudgement,</HI> though of lesse
present conceit. And these are such, as generally im|ploy
themselues in State-affaires; wherein Experi|ence,
purchased by an vsefull expence of time, doth
so ripen them, as the Publike State takes notice of
them, and recompenceth their care with honours
conferred on them.</P>
<P>These and many other excellent endowments shall
we obserue to bee <HI>lineally</HI> deriued from Ancestors to
their successors; which, as they retaine a neare re|semblance
of their persons, so they represent their
Actions: so powerfull is <HI>nature</HI> in bestowing her di|stinct
Offices on euery creature, wherein they gene|rally
partake of their <HI>disposition</HI> as wel as outward <HI>fea|ture:</HI>
whence the Poet,
<Q><L>Stout men and good are sprung from stout and good,</L>
<L>Horses and steeres retaine their parents blood.</L></Q></P>
<P>Yet see the iniquity of time! It fareth oft-times
with those who are endowed with these vertues, to
be most traduced, where their more noble and emi|nent
parts are to be highliest honoured. Which, as
it was a maine error in former ages, so descends it to
these present times. When <HI>Rome</HI> was in her glory,
this eclipsed her light, by detracting from their de|merits
most, whose free-bred vertues deserued of
their Countrey best. Sundry Families shee had, fa|mous
for their vertues, which by a depraued and
mis-interpreting Censure, became branded with vn|deserued
aspersious. If the <HI>Piso's</HI> were frugall, they
<PB N="180" REF="114">
were held parcimonious; if the <HI>Metelli</HI> deuout, they
were superstitious; if the <HI>Appij</HI> strict, they were ri|gorous;
if the <HI>Man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">j</HI> affable, they were ambitious;
the <HI>Laelij,</HI> if wise, they were dangerous; the <HI>Publico|lae</HI>
popular, by being courteous. But with good and

though it bee neuer so much impeached by a

<P>Thus you haue heard, <HI>Gentlewomen,</HI> what <HI>vert<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">es</HI>
haue <HI>lineal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">y</HI> and by <HI>blood</HI> descended from Parents to
their Children; what especiall inward graces vsual|ly
attend some especiall families, which no lesse me|morize
them, than those natiue honours which are
conferred on them. Now, to select such as sort best
with your sexe and condition; in my opinion there
is none that ennobles you higher, or makes you
more gracious in the eye of the beholder than <HI>Mo|desty,</HI>
which was the greatest aduancer of many <HI>Ro|man</HI>
families. This is that <HI>vertue,</HI> which expresseth
you to be women; this is that, which makes you ho|noured
amongst women. Chaines and Carken<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ts,
Iewels and Habiliments may bee valued; but this
Ornament is of that high estimate, as it is not to be
prized. Now, there is nothing that will cause this
to appeare more pretious vnto you, next to the te|stimony
of a good Conscience within you, with an
ardent desire of promoting his glory who made you,
than a reflexion to your <HI>Family</HI> which bred you;
whose honour to preserue, as it is your especiall du|ty,
so no obiect of profit or pleasure, no attractiue
Lure of deceiu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ng honour should remoue this opini|on
from you: <Q>To bee high borne and basely min|ded,
is to ingraffe bastard slippes in a noble stocke.</Q>
High and heroicke vertues become great house&punc;
for, as they were first made <HI>great</HI> by being <HI>good,</HI> so
should they by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">rceasing from being <HI>good,</HI> lose their
<PB N="181" REF="114">
title of being <HI>great.</HI> If by abusing the liberty of time,
you detract from your Ancestors fame, you lye a
blemish on his shrine; which, though it touch not
him, yet it taints you who represent him.</P>
<P>This, no doubt, was that Noble Lady right mind|full
of, when on a time being sollicited by a power|full
Suitor, who wooed her first in person, and after
in a wanton Rhetoricall Letter, she, as one tender of
her honour, and perceiuing that the scope of his suit
tended to her dishonour, answered his fruitlesse sol|licitancy
in this sort, with great modesty: <Q>Should
I condescend to your Suit, I should not only dero|gate
from the honour of my present state, dis-value
that which I hold most deare, make my selfe a sub|iect
of contempt to euery eare, but asperse that in|famy
on my family, which would beare record of
my inconstancy. O what would the next age re|port
of me, that I should so farre degenerate from
those that bred me? No; pouerty may enter in at
my gate, but dishonour shall neuer lodge in mine
heart. Reserue these promises of honour for such,
as prize them aboue their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">nour: That <HI>generous</HI>
blood which distreames through my veynes, shall
sooner be dried, than it shall be for any hope of ad|uancement
ingloriously stained.</Q></P>
<P>Such singular resolues many of our <HI>Albion</HI> Ladies,
questionlesse, euen at this day retaine; who, rather
than they would incurre the least dishonour, or oc|casion
suspition by their too free entertaine of light
Suitors, would confine themselues to their Cham|bers&punc;
and debarre themselues of publike recourse.
Seeing then, that there are <HI>natiue Seeds of goodnesse
sonne in generous bloods by lineall succession;</HI> which euen
in their first infancy giue faire promises of their in|ward
beauty: expresse your selues Daughters wor|thy

Enioy their vertues too, and their memories shall
liue fresher in you. All memorials, being materials,

to your graue. All which by <HI>instruction</HI> onely may

more bound to them for their <HI>breeding</HI> than <HI>bearing,

<P>But for as much as it is not giuen to most of you to

be Linguists, albeit many of their workes be transla|ted
in your mother-tongue, you may conuerse with
sundry English Authors, whose excellent instructi|ons
will sufficiently store you in all points; and if vse|fully
applied, conferre no small benefit to your vn|derstanding.
I shall not need particularly to name
them to you, because I doubt not, but you haue made
choyce of such faithfull Retainers and vertuous Bo|some-friends,
constantly to accompany you. Neither,
indeed, are <HI>bookes</HI> onely necessary; conference will
singularly improue your knowledge; but that is not
altogether so conuenient nor decent for your sexe in
publike places. So as, I much condemne their opini|on,
who hold no meanes so fitting to bring their
daughters to audacity, as a frequent consort with
Company. This, in time, begets in them rather <HI>im|pudence</HI>
than <HI>boldnesse.</HI></P>
<P>It was held a touch to a Maid to bee seene talking
with any one in a publike place. But in priuate Nur|series,
which may be properly termed your <HI>houshold
Academies,</HI> it will suit well with your honors to treat
and enter into <HI>Conference</HI> one with another; or in such
places, where your owne sexe is onely conuersant.
For such indiscreet Mothers, who vsually trim and
deck their daughters, to send them forth to Showes,
Meetings, or Enterludes, they annoynt bauin with
oyle, that it may burne the better. But much more
blame-worthy bee those, who take them along to
Tauernes and gossippings; which Educat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">on a little
time will bring into custome, and make modesty a
stranger to her selfe. For aboue all things (saith the
Philosopher) ought young Girles to be kept from E|briety:
which he confirmes with this reason: <Q>It
is good, saith hee, for young men and maids to bee
kept from wine, lest such become afterwards pro|fest
drunkards, profuse rioters, and prodigall expo|sets
<PB N="188" REF="118">
of their honour: the maine occasion whereof,
are their parents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">it. 7.</NOTE> by meanes of their ill <HI>instruction,</HI>
and worse example.</Q></P>
<P>It is the very <HI>first instruction</HI> that takes the <HI>deepest im|pression;</HI>
how necessary then is it for you, <HI>Gentle wo|men,</HI>
whose sexe is the Embleme of weakenesse, and
whose best resolues are oft-times weakned by youth|full
promises, to furnish your blooming youth with
wholesome instructions: and so to improue them,
that they may increase in vigour, as you doe in sta|ture?
This your sexe exacts of you; this your pre|sent
estate requires of you: and this shall easily be ef|fected
by you, if hauing (as is to be presupposed) dis|creet
and religious Mothers, you submit your selues
in all humble obedience to their direction. For as it
is very hard for any one to know how to command,
vnlesse she know first how to obey; so will it be vn|to
you to performe the office of a Mother, if you ne|uer
knew the duty of a daughter. Strict and seuere
may those Commands seeme to your youth, which
riper age will easily digest. Againe, you that
are Mothers, become patternes of modesty vnto
your daughters. Your liuing actions are the lines of
their direction. While they are vnder your com|mand,
the error is yours, not theirs, if they goe astray.
Their <HI>honour</HI> should be one of the principall'st things
you are to tender; neither can it be blemished, with|out
some touch to your Credit. I haue knowne some
inconsiderate mothers, and those none of the lowest
ranke or quality, who either out of a confidence they
had of their daughters good carriage, or drawn with
the hopes of some rich Suitors to aduance their mar|riage,
haue vsually giuen too free way to opportuni|ty,
which brought vpon their daughters names a
spreading infamy.</P>
<P>Your <HI>instructions</HI> will doe well with them, till so|ciety
<PB N="189" REF="118">
depraue them: diuert then the occasion, so shall
your daughters, be they neuer so poore, haue good
portions of reputation. Suffer not then those who
partake of your image, to lose their best beauty. Sigh
then if they bee soyled, for their shame must bee on
you aspersed.</P>
<P>Grace is a pure balme, and consequently requires a
pure and sound vessell. In vaine is it infused, if the
vessell be not whole and sound to preserue it. Looke
then to your own actions; these must informe them;
Looke to your owne examples, these must confirme
them. Without you they cannot perish; with you
they may. What will you doe with the rest that is
left, when you see a part of your selfe lost?</P>
<P>The <HI>Harpie</HI> hath the face of a man, but a Bird so cru|ell
by nature, as when she is an hungry, she wil assault
any man and kill him. After which bloudy repast, she
becomes thirsty, so as, going to the Riuer to quench
it, she sees her owne face; and recalling&punc; to mind how
it resembles him whom she slew, she conceiues such
griefe, as she dyes therewith. If your Education or
<HI>instruction</HI> depraue those who deriue their beginning
from you, the resemblance of this story may haue
proper relation vnto you. But if your pious examples
enable them, their proficiency in vertue shall enno|ble
you; your comforts shall be multiplyed in them;
your hopes seconded by them; and to your euer-li|uing
fames, the memory of your vertues preserued by
them.</P>
<P>Let not that adage proue true, in respect of your
Charge: <Q><HI>The most precious things haue euer the most
pernicious Keepers.</HI></Q> Nothing more precious than a
Virgins honour; it were shame for the mother to
proue a <HI>Tarpeian</HI> or treacherous keeper. That Con|ceit
was elegantly expressed by the Emperour <HI>Charls</HI>
the fifth, in his instructions to the King his sonne;
<PB N="190" REF="119">
<Q><HI>That Fortune had somewhat of the nature of a woman;
that if she be too much woo'd, she is the farther off.</HI></Q> But
I hope I shall not finde that auersenesse in you. I haue
wooed you in words; expresse your selues wonne by
the testimony of your workes. I would not follow
the indiscretion of Empericks, which minister same
medicines to all Patients; I know well, that such
Physicke as agrees with age, would not agree with
the hot constitution of youth: To either sort there|fore
haue I applyed my seuerall receits: and to both,
doe I addresse my conclusion.</P>
<P><Q>Let the whole progresse of your Conuersation
be a continued Line of <HI>instruction;</HI> Let the mother
discharge her office in <HI>commanding,</HI> and that with|out
too much rigour or indulgence; Let the daugh|ter

Morall Philosophy, much more our Christian theo|ry,

which had not neare relation to <HI>goodnesse.</HI> Those on|ly
they esteemed worthy <HI>honour,</HI> who did not seeke

knew not what it was to admire the <HI>purple,</HI> nor
fawne on a rising <HI>fauorite;</HI> but interueined their a|ctions
with the precious Oare of Diuinest vertues.
Such as had attained to a singular Command or so|ueraignty
of their affections: so as, they had lear|ned
to say as <HI>Chilo</HI> answered his brother, <HI>We know how

<PB N="193" REF="120">
or countenancing vniust actions. These detract from
<HI>honour;</HI> neither can their memory liue long, who
makes authority a Sanctuary to wrong. Know then,
(noble <HI>Gentlewomen</HI>) that your <HI>Honour,</HI> be it neuer
so eminent; your <HI>Descent,</HI> be it neuer so ancient; lose
both their beauty and antiquity, if <HI>vertue</HI> haue not

painted and trimmed in neuer so demure or hypo|criticall
disguise; Be your ambition or Courtly aspi|ring
neuer so shrouded with gilded shadowes of hu|mility;
Be your vnbounded desire of reuenge neuer
so smoothly coloured with the seeming remission of
an impressiue iniury. In a word, should you neuer
walke so couertly in a Clowd; nor neuer so cunning|ly
with a dainty kind of dissembling gull the world;
all this will not auayle you. When your bodies shall
come to be shrouded, then shall all your actions be
vncased. Rumour then will take more liberty to dis|couer
vnto the world, what you did in it. Shew me
that deepest dissembler, who retired himselfe most

<P>Many you haue knowne and heard of, that were

for <HI>vertue,</HI> would you know how to define her, that
you may more eagerly desire to become her retainer?
Or would you haue her described, that you may

Heare the Poet;

<P>Such a noble resolued temper euer accompanies

their lips. Though their mold be but the same, they
would faine change themselues into another mold.
These are such as deserue not your knowledge;
though they be by their titles honoured, their titles
by their ignoble actions become blemished. Let
them therefore study making of a face; composing
of their gate; preseruing of their vaine pompe; with

an vnbeseeming port: while your Contemplation
shall fixe it selfe on no other obiect, than that true

<P>That Mot of the <HI>Athenians</HI> to <HI>Pompey</HI> the Great,
<HI>Thou art so much a God, as thou acknowledgest thy selfe to

man, is to confesse himselfe to be a man. Vio|lets,
though they grow low and neare the earth, smel
sweetest; and <HI>Honour</HI> appeares the fullest of beauty,
when she is humblest. Alas! what are titles worth,
when deserts are wanting? The best signall of <HI>de|scent,</HI>
is distinguished by <HI>desert. Antiochus</HI> was at one

it approues or applauds, any permanent <HI>honour.</HI>
It is miserable (saith the Poet) to rely on anothers
fame;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Horace&punc;</NOTE> but worse, to begge fame from them that are
infamous. It is prayse-worthy to bee by some dis|praysed;
yea, vertuous actions, should they bee by
vicious persons commended, would rather lose of
their lustre, than become any way improued. To be
cheerefull in aduersity, humble in prosperity, and in
both to shew a temperate equality, is worthy praise,
and deserues <HI>Honour</HI> for a prize. Yet, should these be
but onely pretences to gull the world, or delude the
simple admirer, they would in time vnmaske them|selues,
and display their counterfeit insides with
shame to the world. False and adulterate colours will
not hold, nor vertuous semblances long retaine the
esteeme they haue. We haue euer held them for most
ridiculous, who follow the fashion, and were neuer
yet in fashion. And such are all those Counterfeit
followers of <HI>vertue,</HI> who pretend fairely, but fall

off fowly. These may be properly, in my opinion,
compared to our new counterfeit stuffes; which, as at

Your Cloath, <HI>Gentlewomen,</HI> must be of another nap:
it must not be the best a farre off. Flowers, Edgings,
Laces, and Borders doe beautifie the outward attire,
but adde no grace to the inward man. Now, that
<HI>Cloath</HI> is the best, which shrinks the least.</P>
<P>Doe any extremities encounter you? Let the inno|cency

<P>It is the argument of a <HI>generous</HI> spirit, to expresse

not therefore pride her selfe in her shame, nor glori|fie
her selfe in the couer of sinne. Shee cannot eye

her selfe with any selfe-loue, seeing she lost her selfe

<P>She is none of these, who are Saints in their tongues,
but Deuils in their liues: Shee propounds nought
fit to be done, which shee confirmes not with her
owne action. Againe, for her actions, shee is free
from publike scandall, as her whole life is a golden
rule of direction, a continued precept of instruction.
In a word, she considers from whence she came, her
<HI>descent</HI> was noble, and this she graceth with noble
vertues. Her <HI>house</HI> must receiue no dishonor fro~ her,

it; no Moath of deserued detraction eat into

blemished the <HI>honour</HI> of that <HI>house</HI> from whence they
came, and corrupted that <HI>noble blood</HI> from which
they sprung, as their memory rots, yet their infa|my
liues. Againe, others there haue beene, who
though obscurely borne, yet by those eminent ver|tues
which did adorne them, those Diuine parts
which did truly ennoble them, they became enlight|ners
of their obscurity, filling Annals with their glo|rious

is not worth receiuing, vnlesse it be entertained
by one that is deseruing: yea, how many haue in|curred
disgrace by dis-esteeming <HI>vertue,</HI> when they

<P>Seeing then no <HI>Cloath</HI> takes such <HI>deepe tincture</HI> as

becomes he piece-meale diuided from himselfe, be|cause
he reflects not with a pure and impartiall eye
vpon himselfe. What great need stands he in then
of direction in this Maze of misery, vale of vanity?
He portraid him well, who in the description of him,

<P>An <HI>honourable</HI> minde is best showne in her <HI>Liberall</HI>
and <HI>compassionate</HI> exhibition to such, whose necessities
require reliefe. Yea, she loues those best, to whom
these arguments of bounty are in highest measure ex|prest.
She auerts not her eare from the needy beg|gar,
she will shew him all fauour for his image or
feature. She holds it an vnbeseeming state, to enter|taine
a sowre looke, where noble pitty should beget
in her a compassionate loue. She is so daily and duely
inured to <HI>workes</HI> of <HI>mercy,</HI> as shee ioyes in no obiect
more than occasion of bounty. Shee considers (and
this she Diuinely applies vnto her selfe) how nought
but vanity is to be attributed to them, retaine they
neuer so much earthly glory on them, who dwell in
houses of clay, whose <HI>foundation</HI> is in the <HI>dust,</HI> which
are <HI>crushed</HI> before the <HI>Moath.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob 4. 19.</NOTE> Silken vanity cannot
delude her, nor any opinionate conceit of her owne
estate transport her. Her minde is not subiect to wa|uering,
nor her walke to wandring. Be her life long;
her goodnesse becomes improued: be it short; her
desires are crowned. Neither reserues shee the glea|nings
for him, that is Master of the Haruest. Pouer|ty,
appeare it neuer so despicable to her <HI>eye,</HI> it con|ueyes
compassion to her <HI>heart.</HI> Shee giues Almes of
the best, for his sake whom shee loues best. A mi|serable
minde she hates; for she conceiues how no|thing
can be better worth enioying, than a liberall
desire of disposing: which she expresseth with that
<PB N="203" REF="125">
cheerefull alacrity, as it inhanceth the value of her
bounty. Thus shee liues in a free and absolute com|mand
of what she enioyes; with an <HI>hand</HI> no lesse o|pen
than her <HI>heart;</HI> that <HI>action</HI> might second her pi|ous
<HI>intention.</HI></P>
<P>Neither is the true Nobility of her minde lesse
discerned by her loue to <HI>Chastity.</HI> Pure bee her
thoughts, and vnstained. The Sanctuary of her heart
is solely dedicated to her Maker; it can find no roome
for an inordinate affection to lodge in. Shee knowes
not how to throw out her loue-attracting Lures;
nor to expose the glorious beauty of her soule to
shame. A moments staine must not blemish her
state. Shee will not therefore giue her eye leaue to
wander, lest it should betray her <HI>honour</HI> to a treache|rous
intruder. How weak proue those assaults, which
her home-bred enemies prepare against her? Her
<HI>looke</HI> must bee set on a purer Obiect than vanity:
Shee will not eye it, lest shee should be taken by it.
Her <HI>Discourse</HI> must be of a better subiect than vani|ty:
She will not treat of it, lest she should be engaged
to it. Her <HI>thoughts</HI> are not admitted to entertaine
vanity: They must not conceit it, lest they should
be deceiued by it. Occasions wisely shee foresees,
timely preuents, and consequently enioyes true free|dome
of minde. You shall not see her consume the
precious oyle of her Lampe, the light of her life, in
vnseasonable reere-bankets; vnprofitable visits; or
wanton treaties. Those will shee not admit of for
companions, who are prodigall of their <HI>honour.</HI> These
she reproues with a mild spirit, labouring to reclaime
them with an ingenuous tender of her vertuous
compassion towards them. None shee more distasts
than these Brokers or Breakers of licentious bar|gaines:
Shee excludes them the List of all ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ill so|ciety.
How cauteious shee is, lest suspition should
<PB N="204" REF="126">
tax her? Outwardly, therefore, shee expresseth,
what she inwardly professeth. That <HI>honourable bloud</HI>
which she from her Predecessors receiued, till death
surprize her, will shee leaue vntainted. Neither is
there ought shee hates more than <HI>pride,</HI> nor scornes
more than <HI>disdaine.</HI> Shee rightly considers how her
daies are <HI>mensurable,</HI> being but a span long, which im|plies
her breuity; and <HI>miserable,</HI> being <HI>altogether va|nity</HI>
Shee disclaymes that state which consists in
scornefull lookes; A sweet and affable Countenance
shee euer beares: The <HI>honour</HI> she enioyes makes her
humbler; and the prayses which are giuen her, work
in her thoughts no distemper. So farre is shee from
affecting the pompe of this world, as it growes con|temptible
to her higher-mounting thoughts. A
faire and well-seeming retinue shee euer keepes a|bout
her: but none of these must be Sycophants, with
their oylie tongues to delude her; neither must any,
who cloaths his Countenance with scorne, attend
her. Shee obserues on what steepe and dangerous
grounds ambition walketh. Her sleepes are sweeter;
her content higher; her thoughts heauenlier. It is
one of her greatest wonders, that any one should be
so rest of vnderstanding, as to forget what infirme
ground he stands on. The purest Creature, be she ne|uer
so absolute in her feature, is of no richer temper
than <HI>Earth,</HI> our Common-mother. She is wiser than
to preferre a poore handfull of <HI>red Earth</HI> before her
choycest treasure. Though her deserts merit <HI>honour,</HI>
shee dis-esteemes her owne deseruings; being high|ly
valued by all but her selfe. Thus shee prepares her
selfe daily for what shee must goe to. Her last day
is her euery dayes memoriall. Lower may her body
be, when interred; but lower ca~not her mind be, than
at this instant. So well hath shee attained the <HI>Know|ledge
of her selfe,</HI> as she acknowledgeth all to be fraile,
but none frailer than her selfe.</P>

<P>The way to <HI>contemplate</HI> these, and <HI>consort</HI> with

<P>Consider, how the eyes of heauen are vpon you;

the <HI>Court,</HI> is for <HI>occasion,</HI> not <HI>fashion:</HI> where her de|meanour
euer giues augmentation to her honor. Her
winning modesty becomes so powerfull a Petitioner,
as she euer returnes a preuailing Suiter. During her
abode in the <HI>City,</HI> she neither weares the Street, nor
wearies her selfe with her Coach; her Chamber is
<PB REF="136">
her T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ring-roome, where she bethinks her how she
may play her part on the worlds Theatre; that shee
may gaine applause of her heauenly Spectators. Her
constant reside is in the <HI>Country;</HI> where hospitality
proclaimes her in-bred affection to workes of piety.
All which she exerciseth with that priuacy, as they
will witnesse for her, she feares nothing more than
vaine-glory. In her house shee performes the office
of a Mistris, no imperious gouernesse. Shee knowes
when to put on a smooth brow, and to cherish indu|stry
with moderate bounty. Her discreet prouidence
makes her family look with a cheereful countenance:
Her posterity cannot chuse but prosper, being nurs'd
by so naturall a mother. The open field she makes her
Gallery; her Labourers, her liuing Pictures; which,
though she finds <HI>meere Pictures,</HI> hanging on, rather
than labouring, Passion transports her not aboue her
selfe, nor forceth her to the least expression vnwor|thy
of her selfe: she passeth by them with a modest
reproofe, which workes in them a deeper impressi|on,
than any fiery or furious passion: Her Neighbors
she daily wooes and winnes: which she effects with
such innocent affability, as none can iustly tax her of
flattery. An <HI>Ouer-seer</HI> for the <HI>poore</HI> she appoints her
selfe, wherein she exceeds all those that are chosen by
the <HI>Parish.</HI> She takes a Suruey daily and duly of them,
and without any charge to the <HI>Hamlet,</HI> relieues them.
She desires not to haue the esteeme of any <HI>She-clarke;</HI>
shee had rather be approu'd by her <HI>liuing,</HI> than <HI>lear|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ing:</HI>
And hath euer preferr'd a sound professant be|fore
a profound disputant. A president of piety shee
expresseth her selfe in her family, which shee so in|structs
by her owne life, as vertue becomes the ob|iect
of their loue. Her taske shee sets her selfe daily,
which she performes duely&punc; Her owne remisnesse,
(if any such be) shee reproues by so much more than
<PB REF="136">
obserue her, could be well content to serue her. Shee
is <HI>generous</HI> in all; Not a Look but giues Life to Loue;
and that so vertuously dispos'd, as not a light thought
can distract it. Her very motion is a mouing dire|ction;
She neuer learned to <HI>tinkle</HI> with her <HI>feet,</HI> to <HI>wan|der</HI>
with her <HI>eyes,</HI> to <HI>stai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e</HI> her spotlesse honour with
a <HI>painted blush.</HI> All shee doth is her owne; All her
owne doth incomparably please; which she clozeth
with this impreze: <HI>Louing Modesty is a Liuing
Beauty.</HI></P>
<P>COMPLEMENT she admits, but not that which
this Age affects; she preferres <HI>Substance</HI> before meere
<HI>formality. Pith</HI> before the <HI>Rinde, Performance</HI> before
<HI>Ceremony.</HI> She distasts nothing so much as that Courts
sustian; which, in her esteeme, is quite out of fashi|on,
<HI>your Seruants Seruant.</HI> She cannot protest in iest,
nor professe what shee meanes not in earnest. Shee
cares not for this Rhetoricall varnish, it makes a
good cause suspitious; her desire is to expresse her
selfe in <HI>action</HI> more than <HI>discourse.</HI> That COMPLEMENT
which consists in congies, cringies, and salutes, dis|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">sheth
her pallate most: it tastes too much of the
Caske; for the rest she is secure, so her actions bee
really pure; her selfe <HI>completely</HI> honest. Thus shee
summes vp her dayes, makes <HI>vertue</HI> her prayse, this
her Impreze; <HI>Ciuill Complement, my best Accomplish|ment.</HI></P>
<P>DECENCY is her natiue Liuery; though shee
make no shadow of it, her owne shadow is not more
indiuiduate. In her attire she is not so sumptuous as
seemely, not so costly as comely; in her discourse she
deliuers her mind not so amply as fully, not so quick|ly
as freely; in her whole course shee expresseth her
inward beauty. Her Glasse is not halfe so vsefull to
her selfe, as the glasse of her life is to others. What|soeuer
is worne by her, receiues a singular grace from
<PB REF="137">
her. Her fashion is neuer out of request; though
more constant in it, than the Age would admit. She
liues to bring <HI>time</HI> into some better <HI>tune:</HI> this is her
taske in euery place; this is that which crownes her
with peace; while shee deuiseth this for her im|preze:
<HI>Virgin-Decency is Vertues Liuery.</HI></P>
<P>ESTIMATION is that precious <HI>odour</HI> whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">h
giues sweetnesse to her <HI>honour.</HI> Dye had shee rather
with it, than enioy an Empire and liue without it. It
is the Goale of all her actions. The Crowne of all her
Labours. Pouerty she holds an incomparable blessing,
so her name be inriched by ESTIMATION: No
<HI>dead Fly</HI> can corrupt that <HI>Ointment.</HI> Happy needs must
be her <HI>State,</HI> that preserues this without <HI>Staine.</HI> This
she feeds not with the i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">yce of vain-glory; nor seeks
to augment it with a fabulous story. Many haue pur|chas'd
praise in Oylie lines, that neuer merited ap|plause
all their liues. Her desire is to <HI>be,</HI> rather than
<HI>seeme,</HI> lest <HI>seeming</HI> to <HI>be</HI> what she <HI>is not,</HI> shee gull the
world, but her selfe most, by playing the counterfeit.
Resolute is she in this her Impreze: <HI>My prize is her
owne prayse.</HI></P>
<P>FANCY shee entertaines with a cheerefull but
chaste bosome. Though Loue be blind, her loue has
eyes. No lesse faithfulll is shee in retaining, than
doubtfull in entertaining. Protests are dangerous
Lures to credulous Louers, but her FANCY is too
staid to stoope vnto them. She can loue well, but lest
she should repent soone, and that too late, shee will
<HI>try</HI> before she <HI>trust,</HI> haue some reason to <HI>like</HI> before
she <HI>loue.</HI> She holds that FANCY <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Fren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">y,</HI> which
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s onely led by <HI>Sense.</HI> She makes <HI>reason</HI> her <HI>guide,</HI> that
<HI>Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tent</HI> may be her <HI>Goale.</HI> Long time shee debates
with <HI>Loue,</HI> before euer she giue <HI>Loue</HI> her <HI>heart;</HI> which
done, shee confirmes the bargaine with her hand.
Her Constancy shee displayes in this Impreze: <HI>My
<PB REF="137">
Choyce admits no Change.</HI></P>
<P>GENTLITY is not her boast, but that which
dignifies that title most. Vertue is her soueraignesse;
in whose seruice to liue and die she holds the absolu|test
happinesse. Gentry shee thinkes best graced by
aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">bility: To be surly, derogates as much from her
worth, as basenesse from Nobility of birth. Her <HI>Li|nage</HI>
is best distinguish'd by her <HI>Crest,</HI> her <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">orth</HI> by
<HI>her selfe.</HI> Her <HI>desert</HI> giues life to her <HI>descent.</HI> Not an
action comes from her, but excellently becomes her.
Shee euer reflects on the <HI>House</HI> from whence shee
came, whose antiquity she ennobles with numerous
expressions of piety, from the rising height of which
increase, she drawes this Christian Impreze: <HI>Desert
Crowne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Descent.</HI></P>
<P>HONOVR she <HI>deserues</HI> more than <HI>desires;</HI> This she
may <HI>admit,</HI> but not <HI>admire.</HI> Weake shee holds that
foundation of HONOVR, where <HI>vertue</HI> is not a sup|porter.
The more HONOVR that is conferr'd on
her, makes her the humbler; she cloathes not her
Looke with a disdainfull scorne, nor clouds her brow
with an imperious frowne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Farre more esteemes she
the title of <HI>goodnesse</HI> than <HI>greatnesse.</HI> Shee holds no|thing
more worthy of her approuing, than a daily
drawing nearer to <HI>Perfection,</HI> by her vertuous liuing.
Her whole Pilgrimage is nothing else than to shew
vnto the world what is most requisite for a gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t
Personage. In a word, shall wee take a re-view of
her Noble carriage in each of our <HI>Obseruances?</HI> For
the <HI>first,</HI> she is fashionably neat; for the <HI>second,</HI> for|mally
discreet; for the <HI>third,</HI> ciuilly complete; for the
<HI>fourth,</HI> amiably decent; for the <HI>fifth,</HI> precious in re|pute;
for the <HI>sixth,</HI> affectionately constant; for the
<HI>seuenth, generously</HI> accommodated; for the <HI>eighth, ho|nourably</HI>
accomplished. Whence it is, that she im|palls
her diurnall race with this imperiall Impreze:
<PB REF="138">
<HI>Honour is Vertues Harbour.</HI></P>
<P>Goe on, then, she may with <HI>Honour,</HI> seeing the
<HI>King</HI> in her <HI>beauty</HI> takes such <HI>pleasure.</HI> A Diuine pre|sage
of promising goodnesse was her infancy; A
continuate practice of piety was her youth and ma|turity;
The cloze of her Pilgrimage a calme passage
from frailty to felicity. Long would the earth keepe
her, but so should she be kept from that which
shee values farre better. Her Husband
cannot stay long behind, seeing
his <HI>better part</HI> is gone
before.</P>
