For in a true Bishop in deed, his words are edifi|cations, his life righteousnes; his presence delightfull, and his memorie blessed. Thus shall your Lordship bring to passe, that those who are not, may be made wise; that those who are, may not be deceiued, that such as haue beene decei|ued may be wise againe: that vnbeleeuers may be conuer|ted vnto the faith, that such as were conuerted, may not be turned from it, that those who are, may returne vnto it, that men peruerted may be directed aright, that men sub|uerted may be called vnto the truth, and that the subuerters themselues, may be conuinced with strong reasons, eyther to amend if it be possible, or if not, to loose their authoritie, that they hurt not others. Of these I may say as Saint Ber|nard doth, (but I will speake to their owne vnderstanding) they are <HI>Canes ad scissionem, vulpes ad fraudem</HI>; and by your Lordships care, and the rest of the Bishops: <HI>aut cor|rigendi, ne pereant, aut ne perimant coercendi.</HI> Now particulerly vnder your Honours fauour, I will expresse in few words, why the answere of this Apologie is directed vn|to your Lordship, as to one to whom in many respects I am especially bound.

<HEAD>A Preface to the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>_THERE are few resolutions that are filled with more hazard, then those which are vnderta|ken to giue satisfaction to dis|tempered humors; wherein whilest euerie man would seeme eyther not to erre at all, or to haue some colourable excuse for that which they had rather call freedom of conscience and Christian libertie then tearme errour, the state of the Church hangeth ballanced with some oppo|site contrarieties, as if it were the most profitable wis|dome to stand in consultation, and not to aduenture to hold any thing. Doubtlesse no cause hath gained lesse to the defendants then this of the Church gouerne|ment; for first being in it selfe barren, it hath little wherein there can be vse of the ancient Fathers: for whilest men out of their owne fancie will frame dis|likes, wee can but in the generall alleage the constant moderation of our forefathers, and without war|rant for particulers, satisfie them so farre as Religion and reason will giue leaue: Secondly, all men are ca|ried with a pittie naturally toward such whom they suppose to suffer for the testimonie of a good consci|ence, whilest others are suspected to flatter the present state; as if nothing could be reputed honest, which were not a bold opposition (vnder colour of con|sciene)
<PB REF="5">
to a setled gouernment, vnto these may be ad|ded that which is not the least euill, that whilest impa|tience &amp; zeale openeth the mouthes of our enemies for any fault in our answering committed by vs; en|uy doth open the mouthes of our supposed friends, for that which may be thought to be done well. So that though the reco~pence hath nothing in it to be desired, this only remaineth as the comfort against all trobles, that it is a right vse of our small talent dispensed with Humility and dutie for the benefit and peace of the Church of Christ; <HI>where,</HI> first in the daies of our late dread soueraigne of blessed memory some fearing su|perstition might returne (like a troublesome guest, nei|ther long nor farr absent) sundry of the most learned &amp; most sincere, not called to the honor &amp; the burden of a Bishopprick were consulted with all, to giue satisfacti|on to such who seemed rather to follow the example of forraine Churches, then to haue iust reasons to mis|like their owne.</P>
<P>To this end letters were sent from the reuerend fa+thers of the Church, to desire the resolution concer+ning the apparell of ministers, Ceremonies, and other indifferent things to <HI>M. Bullinger, F. Martyr, Gualter, Bu|cer,</HI> &amp; others, men without comparison for integrity &amp; learning equall to the best in those times, &amp; not much exceeded by any, to my knowledge that haue liued since; their answers to these questions for the content|ment of our brethren (if they loue peace) we thought to haue published in the end of this treatise.<NOTE PLACE="marg">By Master Cartwright Martin. &amp;c</NOTE> After these times, by the suggestion of some both from Geneua &amp; Scotland, the Church had not long rest, but that di|uers admonitions, were written to the Parliament, de|siring a new discipline, sundry Inuectiues against the
<PB REF="5">
Bishops &amp; diuers vnhallowed pa~phlets from the brood of <HI>Cham,</HI> who gloried in the discouery of the supposed nakednes of their owne fathers; a little more then or|dinary rigor (for their malypart boldnes had awaked the accustomed cleme~cy of a most gracious prince) by the execution of some few, stopped in a manner for a time the mouthes, &amp; the Pennes of all; letting the ages that come after vnderstand thus much, that writings how learned soeuer (as what could be more excellent for modesty &amp; iudgement,<NOTE PLACE="marg">D. Whitgift.</NOTE> then the pains of that most worthy Archbishop) are able to do litle good for the quiet of the Church, if the magistrates be wanting to giue aid: &amp; that they who at first make holines &amp; refor+mation the scope of whatsoeuer they say or write, pre|tending to aime at nothing but to make men better; in the end, by degrees fall to a vanity prophanely to libel to make others laugh, &amp; in my weak opinio~ few things euer hapned in this kingdom more auailable to breed Atheisme then that was. But the scope being for a Presbyteriall discipline it found with the most of that faction this fauour to be reprooued no more sharpely then the sin of the sons of <HI>Hely</HI>: hitherto all stroue for a Presbitery, wherof at the first comming of our most gracious soueraigne to this kingdom many were filled with a vain hope, doubtle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> deceiued by such men, who either vnderstood not the state of this co~monwealth or had little care of the happy prosperity of this Church.</P>
<P>But in the end, when authority was more blessed, &amp; assisted from aboue, then to be deluded with such mists or to giue any hope to couetous affections gree|dily longing for the fall of Bishops (which one Act of preseruing their state and honour) amongst many thousand arguments of fauour shewed towards them shall stirre vp the praiers of all that now liue for
<PB REF="6">
the continuance of his state, and make his memorie blessed amongst all posterities to the worlds end; then I say many began to make a rent in the Church, and to breake from vs (chusing rather (with what consci|ence they know) to forsake their function and calling, then to yeeld their conformitie to the cerimonies of this Church; which hitherto by themselues were euer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eputed as things indifferent; and doubtlesse neither so many nor so dangerous, but in this time of light and knowledge they may be admitted without supersti|tion at all: forseeing (as <HI>Peter Martyr</HI> saith) we be so free as we haue but a few Ceremonies, and those easie and gentle, it would be an intollerable thing, and wor|thie to be condemned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P Martyr. 20 C. Coun. part. 4. cap 11. sect. 9</NOTE> if we should not performe them without corruption. I wish those to consider well, who are desirous to make these things simply vn|lawfull, both how they differ from themselues and others at other times, and what bondage (vnder the name of libertie) they impose vpon the Church by de|nying her authoritie to ordaine ceremonies; in which if little or nothing be left vnto her, neither shall she need much the directio~ of Gods spirit to guid her con|sultations, nor challenge any great obedience in her owne name, if all things that are, be simply either good or euill: to which errour if Zeale or opinion shall tran|port any, he must eyther make the worship of God to be without Ceremonies, or those Ceremonies simply necessarie, without which there is no wor|shippe; none that I know would haue religion to want all Ceremonies, sauing onely those who would haue all men to want Religion: some there are which wish that these ceremonies were simple, chast, and few, that is not significant at all: It were doubtlesse a
<PB REF="6">
great folly (if not an idlenes in God seruice) eyther to admit or retaine those ceremonies, which they pur|posed should signifie nothing; but moderate minds do think otherwise, that neither ceremonies nor their sig|nification, are to be misliked as vnlawfull, whilest no|thing is signified, but that which the~selues wil account lawfull. So then, neither depriuing the Church of the vse of ceremonies in diuine worship, nor making these of that vnchangeable nature as simply eyther her good or euill, but onely as things of themselues indifferent, (for better place and respect they neuer retained in our Church) we will briefely set downe for the satisfying of some men; that indifferent things by Ciuill or Ec|clesiasticall constitution do change their nature, and by vertue of commaundement become necessarie; so that eyther they must be not indifferent, but simply vnlawfull; or being indifferent, such as by command|dement are made necessarie. To denie that there are things indifferent, is to take Christian libertie from men: and to denie the ceremonies in their owne nature to be such, is to take al liberty from the Church for without these what is there wherein the Church is not expresly and necessarily directed by the word of God? we are taught that all things which happe~ vnder the compasse of human action are of three sorts; eyther good, or euill, or indifferent: of the first and the se|cond kinde are all things commaunded or forbidden in the law of God, (except the ceremonie of the Sab|bath) commaunded to the Iewes but not to vs: Indiffe|rent things are of that nature, that by themselues, and properly they are neither good nor euill, but in respect of some other thing,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> as to drinke Wine, Ale, or Wa|ter, to vse these or those garments which of themselues
<PB REF="7">
haue no holines in the~, &amp; by which a man is not made better: &amp; of these only, &amp; such like, the Apostle speaketh, all things are lawful forme:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.12. 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.22.</NOTE> wherin whilst he professed his freedome, yet he acknowledgeth that he became bou~d, &amp; to the Iew a Iew, to those that were vnder the law, as vnder the law, to those that were without the law, as without the law, to the weak he became weake, to co~clude, he became al to al, that he migh win some: thus he made a vow at <HI>Cenchrea,</HI> circumcised <HI>Timothy</HI> which he did not to <HI>Titus,</HI> by reason of false brethren crept in to spy their liberty: so that all things were law+ful, not only which co~cerned co~mon life, but also in ce|remonies &amp; the outward worship of God, in which (as one wel noteth) the spiritual worship is shadowed, but not contained. But when experience had taught, that such liberty became dangerous to the Church &amp; the co~monwelth, being turned ofte~times into a lice<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tious impiety or superstition, vnlesse it were bounded with some limits, the one sort aduenturing to do all things that seemed pleasing, and thereby reiecting the cere|monies as too great a burthe~, being things not as plea|sing to God, who will be worshipped in truth: the o|ther strictly obseruing all ceremonies, as if the greatest holines &amp; principall parts of Gods worship consisted in them: thus the one led to prophanenes, &amp; the other to superstition, the two dangerous extreames o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> true religion. For which mischiefe necessitie hath onely found out this remedy, to moderate this liberty that it neither erre on the right hand nor the left, that it ney|come short nor go beyond a meane; therfore the Apo|stle saith all things are lawful for me, but al things pro|fit not, all things are lawful, but al things are not expe|die~t, wherin he toucheth the extemities at both hands. Now then the means to keep our liberty, that it neither
<PB REF="7">
be too much, nor too little are of two sorts: general, &amp; speciall: the general is charity the principal direction of mans life. For whatsoeuer we desire to do or omit (being in it selfe indiffere~t) charity must consider how farre to proceed without offence: for why should our liberty (saith S. <HI>Paul</HI>) be conde~ned of another mans con+science? &amp; therfore in this case we are rather to depart from that liberty we haue, then to be offensiue to those who are more weak, &amp; so giue occasion for the~ to speak euil of vs, &amp; of that which was left free: for charity wil|leth vs in these things to respect others more then our selues, &amp; rather to omit that which is lawful for vs, the~ to do that which is hurtfull for them: the other rule to limit indiffere~t things is speciall: which is not so distin|guisht from the other, as if it were without charity, but that charity which ought to be in all, is here directed in a speciall maner: for howsoeuer charity so extendeth it selfe that it may serue to all parts of our life, as though we need not to be directed by any other law, yet be|cause al men are not so wel sighted perfectly to discern what is expedient at all times, &amp; for that the offices of charity are somtimes changed, (for times &amp; occasions may fal out, that things iust &amp; to be done, may be clean contrary) therfore there is required an experienced and mature iudgment to determine what is fit, least whilst we labour to profit we iniury the Church &amp; the com|monwealth, in which are contained the charities of all. God therefore respecting mans weaknes hath ap|pointed magistrates &amp; Gouernours in both, to serue as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ies to guide &amp; direct what is fit to be done, &amp; to this end to make lawes concerning indifferent things, that so the whole body may be gouerned with <HI>comelines, order,</HI> and <HI>edification.</HI> This no man can denie, but such as desire to be exempted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rom all lawes; For executi|on wherof God hath appoynted Magistrates to be his
<PB REF="8">
Ministers to whom we must be subiect, not for feare but for conscience; obeying also our spirituall rulers, for they watch ouer vs to giue account vnto God for our soules.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 13 Heb. 13</NOTE> And therefore no man can denie, but that in things of this nature, all men are to be gouerned by their lawes; which whilest they are in force, comman|ding or forbidding binde the conscience as the De|calogue doth. Herein if any would seeme to see more then those that doe make lawes (a thing not likely se|ing the most, and the wisest, and the best experienced are assembled to that end) we cannot think it warran|table to be so presumptuous, nor expedient to dispute (but in place of counsell) of the equitie of lawes when they are once established: this moderati|on if all men had obserued, doubtlesse long since this Church had beene blessed with a happie peace. But if any man be perswaded that the ceremonies inioy|ned are not of this nature, it is but an opinion lately sprung vp, whereunto the necessitie of obedience in indifferent things hath compelled them to flie, and it satisfieth vs (though it cannot then) that with all an|tiquitie, and the Church we do thinke otherwise: God grant vs all in due time truly to thinke and to speake the same things.

We account Ceremonies in religion, if they be harm|lesse, and tend to edification (such as are the Ceremo|nies of our Church) the second <HI>Intentions</HI> of the <HI>Law, Intermediate meanes,</HI> not to be dispised of a better and more religious seruice: for as to thinke that Ceremo|nies (without true &amp; inward holinesse) could cleanse from sinnes, were to erre; and to bee lewish and su|perstitious, so to account them of no vse, were to bee meerely prophane. For both the <HI>Iudiciall</HI> and the <HI>Ce|remoniall</HI> Lawe, being in a sort Morall (as the schole|men speake) the one in an order to our neighbours, the other, in an order to God; these haue no other allow|ance in Gods worship, but as they are vertuous furthe|rances of his honour. In the Ceremonies of the olde Lawe, there were three things to be obserued. First, that they were all ordained <HI>for the expressing of the in|ward

and morall worshippe,</HI> to serue to true holinesse, <HI>Faith, Hope</HI>&punc; and <HI>Charity,</HI> without which, all the rest were reiected (euen as a burden) by him that comma~|ded them; saying, <HI>I will haue mercy, but not sacrifice.</HI> Se|condly, if Ceremonies bee contrary to true holinesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1.

In this respect they were dispensable, when either by the place or time, two violent circumstances of all our actions or for som Impediment they could not wel be vsed, this made, that euen Circumcision was omitted for those who were born in the desart;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ios. 5.</NOTE> as being vnfit to moue Immediatly after that wound, and beeing vncertaine to rest, seeing they must follow the fire &amp; the cloud when they mo|ued.

Those times beeing fittest to serue GOD with greater reue|rence and more holy solemnities which are com|passed about with greater rest, and more happie blessings. Lastly, when Ceremonies are requi|site to testifie our faith (as doubtlesse they are then when they are either vpon malice or through misvn|derstanding oppugned) wee may not in conscience re|mit any part of them: for the refusing of such can be no small sinne, where the vsing is blessed with the crowne of Martyrdome.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1.

In your first, concerning the gouern|ment of the Church (which you call discipline) nei|ther is it vndetermined what was prescribed by the A|postles of Christ, nor what succession of Bishops was continued in all Churches, euen from their time, so that it must needes seeme strange, that the gouern|ment by Elders or by Bishoppes should in your opi|nion, be a thing so indifferent, as that neither beeing prescribed <HI>by the Apostles of Christ, neither of them repug|nant to the word of God, may wel &amp; profitably be both vsed.</HI> It seemeth stra~ge to my vnderstanding, that after so ma|ny sharpe conflictes for the discipline of the Churh, after such bitter inuectiues against the authority of Bi|shops; After so confident commendation of the go|uernment by Elders maintained, as onely warrantable and inioyned out of Gods word; fancies wherwith ye haue filled the Church for this fifty yeares, that you should now confesse neither to be co~maunded, neither to bee repugnant to Gods word. What meant the de|monstration of discipline, and others, to indeauour to proue the gouernment by Elders not to bee the inuen|tion of wise men, and not against the word of God, but to be the expresse commaundement (in euery particu|ler) of GOD himselfe, accounting those to haue no Church (this being as essential as either the Word or Sacraments) where this is wanting: What meant the
<PB N="34" REF="25">
vehement commendations of this discipline, in a booke called the <HI>Humble Motion,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 31.27.74.64.</NOTE> that if this were esta|blished, God would blesse our victuals and satisfie our poore with bread, that he would cloath our Priests with health, and his Saints should shout for ioy, that it is best and surest for our state; that it would cut off contentions and suites of Law; that it would norish learning; that then there would bee vnity in the Church, that it would bee strength and victorie and many other benefits like these. Why haue they stri|uen so earnestly for it, if it were not absolutely com|maunded in Gods word,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quod de scriptu|ris sacris autho|ritatem non ha|bet eadem facili|tate contemnitur qua probatur.

But though you haue dealt so liberally with vs for the gouernment of Elders, yet we dare not doe so with you in the gouernment of Bishops. For, if <HI>Clement</HI> saide true (whome <HI>Polidore</HI> alledgeth to that end) that <HI>Peter</HI> in euery Prouince appointed one Archbishoppe, whome all other Bishops in the same Prouince should obey, if the name of Archbishoppe and Bishoppe were not so vnusuall, that <HI>Volusianus</HI> was not afraid to say,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Volustanus wrot.

<P>A Weeke after I was called before the Bishop of London, the Deane of the Chappell being with him, and (after many sharpe rebukes for my Sermon preached before his Ma|iestie) vrged to subscribe to the three articles; we stood a time in clearing some exceptions then taken: at last, I prayed leaue to write downe the same limitation which I had written to his Maiestie, and then read before them. Which being denyed as idle and needlesse to be exprest, because it was alwaies im|plied and vnderstood, I (taking them both and God to witnes that I did subscribe in the same sence, and with the same li|mitations that I had expressed in that sent vnto his Maiesty) did then subscribe. This done, I pretested vnto them that I had in the some manner, and with the same protestation sub|scribed twise before, yet wished that my present subscription might not be diuulged, but as I my selfe should open it, least I should be thoght to haue done that at this time out of feare, &amp; for desire of inlargment (which God knew, I had done accor|ding to my iudgement) &amp; so become lesse profitable in my cal|ling, &amp; lesse able to satisfie other men. The bishop replied that the King must know it, otherwise for his part it should be con|cealed,
<PB N="39" REF="27">
which the Deane also promised as well as he, I answe|red that I knew well his Maiestie must know it, and ca|red not who knew it but in the former respect, and that my selfe would make it knowne, (which thing I did the same houre and neuer yet denyed) beseeching them to informe his Maiestie that I had done no more now then before, least his Maiesty should thinke me caried by feare as a man of an euill conscience, which they both promised to doe: his Lord|ship and Master Deane then exhorted me to conformitie in practise, I answered, that for my iudgement of the ceremo|nies, they knew it (as did also many of the ministers) amongest whom I had at sundry conferences discouered and maintay|ned my opinion of their lawfulnes: but for practise, I should yeilde to haue them vsed in my cure, but in my owne per|son who had neuer vsed them, and once lost my place for not vsing them, I durst not promise it (at least) vntill I had done what I could to preuent offence. Two daies after this, I was called againe before the Bishop to be discharged of mine imprisonment by order from his Maiesties Counsell. At what time the Bishop exhorted me to conforme my selfe, and perswade other men, for conformitie I besought his Lord|ship not to expect it at my hands, nor to say, I doubled with him, if I performed it not so long as the feare of scandall should restraine me, adding that his Lordship might gaine much honour to himselfe, and peace to the Church by shewing compassion vpon the ministers in a few lighter things, when their hearts were so inclinde to peace, his Lordship replied that I should haue time to teach and satisfie my people, I an|swered that I did not so much feare the offence of those, with whom I now liue, as of other places where I had liued. And as touching the satisfying of other men I tolde him, I might not vndertake to perswade, but
<PB N="40" REF="28">
would be readie vpon any occasion to professe freely what I thought, as I had done alreadie at sundrie conferences, and that I had that day receiued some obiections of a friend in writing, to which I had promised Answer. His Lordship wished to see the arguments, but I craued pardon, bycause they were committed to me from a friend, and vpon trust, he then required to see mine answer before I should send it to my friend, which I yeilded vnto, and haue not yet bro|ken, for I neuer sent answer to it, nor euer shall. And this my Lord to my best remembrance is the whole summe of that which I haue done, and the world speaketh of so much, and diuersly out of all which this summe ariseth: First, that I haue foure times subscribed to the Booke of common prayer with limitation and reference of all things therein contay|ned, vnto the purpose and doctrine of this Church of Eng|land, and limitation I eyther wrote down or protested before witnesse: Secondly, that I neuer promised present confor|mitie in practise, howsoeuer I confessed the ceremonies not simply vnlawfull, as I did since also before your Lordship.</P>

<P>IT is the desire of all men who are willing to conti|nue the reputation without wrong, to be able to giue account of what they doe, and to render a rea|son of what they speake. The narration of your beha|uiour and trouble, as also your opinion concerning conformitie with this Church, as we haue receiued it vnder your owne hand, so wee desire leaue without of|fence to obserue some few things materiall to this end, and although your reducing the summe of the whole storie to those two heads: first, that you haue foure
<PB N="41" REF="28">
times subscribed to the booke of common praier with limitation and reference of all things therein contay|ned vnto the purpose and doctrine of this Church of England. Secondly, that you neuer promised confor|mitie in practise, howsoeuer you confessed the ceremo|nies not simply vnlawfull; be the principall things contayned in it; yet, because some other things are pertinent to this cause, wee will rather examine then answer what you haue alleadged.</P>
<P N="1">1 You haue yeilded to subscribe with limitatio~, which limitation is the purpose and intention of the Church of England, a caueat (doubtlesse) not needful to be ex|pressed, seeing it is the same Church that requireth subscription, who would not haue any within her own bosom require an allowance to the fancies &amp; opinions that others hould. And peraduenture wise men will thinke that the distinctions found out, are but euasions do what they would not seeme, whilst in the meane time they might lurke vnder some equiuocall cloud as the Iesuits doe.</P>
<P N="2">2 Further, you desire that your present subscription might not bee diuulged, but as your selfe might open it, a thing you see both yeilded vnto, and performed by those, in whose power it was but doubt|full what intention you had, in concealing of it; I can easily afford you so much charity as to thinke it was, least some sinister and false collections might be deri|ued from it, whilest some others (peraduenture) more probably think, that you meant to beare your brethren in hand, that you yeilded not so farre as in truth ye did. Consider if the concealement of this subscrip|tion haue not some proportion with the hypocricy of
<PB N="42" REF="29">
<HI>Saul,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Sam. 15, 30.</NOTE> but <HI>honour me I pray thee before the elders of my people:</HI> and that which you feare would be taken to be an euil conscience, could not (but in the iudgement of so wise a Prince) be thought an obedient and an humble mind.</P>
<P N="3">3 The third thing is, that notwithstanding your al|lowance of these ceremonies, yet you could not con|forme your selfe, but would willingly allow the prac|tise of them by some other, euen in your owne cure, this in my apprehension doth seeme strange, for seeing your flocke haue that good opinion of you as is fit for sheepe to haue of their pastor, and that you feare not any scandal amongst them (as your selfe afterward con|fessed) your example might haue remooued both from them &amp; others neare vnto you all offence (if there were any) who peraduenture might haue stumbled at the same things being vsed by others, and scandal being so, dangerous is not fit to be offered by a Curate.</P>
<P N="4">4 Fourthly, you intreat compassion towards the ministers in a few lighter things. Let me tell you that mildnesse in some other cases may be a vertue, but in this a vice: and surely he fayleth in his episcopall cou|rage, who through remisnesse or pitie suffereth the lawes of the Church (by being wilfully broken) to be vnhallowed disturbers of the Churches peace, and surely if the vrging of subscription which the law re|quired, haue beene the cause of the seuerall dissentions in our Church, a worse effect could not haue procee|ded from so good a cause, then that that which was a vertuous inuention to make peace, by the vnquiet dis|position of some few should become the originall fountaine of so much warr. Besides, experience telleth vs that the mildnes which that Reuerend Archbishop
<PB N="43" REF="29">
<HI>Grindall</HI> vsed in those times little auailed with those men for to make them better, and the last Archbishop of famous memory found it to be most true that such as were spared eyther from his owne compassion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whitgif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> the im|portunity of others, or a hope to win the~ by this means, the fauour shewed them in that kind they esteemed but desert, &amp; his mildnes &amp; patie~ce to be their own merit: besides, the things are not to be esteemed few or light which are manifold disobedie~ces to those peaceable or|ders &amp; lawful co~stitutions which the Church maketh.</P>

If they vrge vs further with the councell of Laodicea, which forbiddeth a|ny thing to be read, that is not Canonicall, we must tell them that the same councell accounteth that Canonicall which is not. Further, we must craue leaue of those who vrge so strictly the reading of the whole Scripture in Churches, in what part of
<PB N="80" REF="48">
the world; or in what to~gue the new testame~t was read in the purest times. Besides, if the authority of Saint <HI>Hierome</HI> (which you vrge against vs) may be accepted as sufficient in this case against you, he will tel you that some part of the beginning of Genesis,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In praefat. in Ezech.</HI></NOTE> the Canticles, the beginning of Ezechiel were not amongst the Iewes permitted to be read of any, vnlesse they were comne to the age of priesthood, which was thirtye, from whence (paraduenture) the gouernors of our Church haue re|strayned their voyces fro~ speaking (by bare reading) to the comon people, who either vnderstand them not at all (being so read) or else peruert them to their owne harme, this is not to sylence them (as you say) but ra|ther to reserue them to a better and safer vse, that those (who for soundnes of Iudgment &amp; knowledge are able) maye reade and expound them at seasons, which are more conuenient. This, if it weare not by lawes strictly commaunded to be obserued of all, but should giue li|berty (as you seeme to desire) to some able ministers to doe otherwise, Ignorance (which is euer boldest) would take aduantage continually to be reading the obscurest chapters, whereby the church of necessity could not chuse, but receiue greate harme, &amp; therfore the desires of a few (peraduenture) by reason of their sufficiency not hurtfull, ought to be no motiue why lawes should not be made or executed, which preuent that the worst disposed may not haue libertye to doe harme, or the weakest to receiue. The Chronicles (some part) the Canticles, the Apocalipse, the chapters of some Genealogyes (things wherin ignorant men haue beene euer most forward to deale) contain (in the iudg|ment of wise men) many things not so requisit for silly

And surely if men well considered eyther the generall weakenesse of many that take vpon them to expound, or the common ignorance of silly people mixt with a pron|nesse to euill, when such Scripture is read, hee must needes thinke the wisedome of our forefathers in this choyce of Scripture to be great, and esteeme the in|struction of the people to be the principall end that was propounded by them, this made the Vniuersitie of Cambridge to giue permission onely to such, to in|terpret Saint <HI>Paules</HI> Epistles, as were thought in diui|nitie fit to be admitted to the degree of <HI>Bachelers,</HI> because Saint <HI>Peter</HI> saith, that in them are many

Yet, howsoeuer, they haue wrongfully accused our Church, in this point, we are glad to see them now so earnest in|treaters, for reading the Scriptures in the Church, see|ing heretofore, the most of them haue beene content for a Sermon of small edification, but of great length, to omit the reading of many Chapters, which might haue beene done at that time, so that, in true vnder|standing, the silencing of the Scripture, was rather to be feared at their hands, who desired to haue it indiffe|rent, and left free for to read it at all.</P>

<P>IT seemeth, there is a curious desire of reprehension in those men, who are willing to reproue the practise of their owne Church, for that which is a custome an|cient, necessarie, and of much vse: wherein wee repre|hend not alone the disposition of such, but wee are ready to let the world see, that the things themselues are most innocent, which they doe reproue. Most of them are not yet come so farre, as to deny Baptisme to Infants (an arrour which may follow from their former opinions, if they suffer Scisme to growe in them, and humours to bee rules for conscience but they are rea|dy to professe, that there is no saith in the childe required to Baptisme, and that to bee borne of faith|full Parents, is as much for their admission into the Church, as the profession of the faith, which they make by the mouthes of others. This, as it is vnthank|full to spurne at the indulgence of the Church; so, it is a contempt of duety, which God requireth on our part: there is no attainment to life, but through the onely begotten sonne of God, nor by him otherwise, then being such for beleefe as wee ought: as if those Articles in the iudgement of God, were set downe for all men: first, to subscribe vnto whom, by Baptisme,

the church receiueth into Christs schoole; and seeing no religion inioyeth sacraments, the signes of Gods loue, vnlesse it haue also that faith whereupon sacra|me~ts are built, could there (as one well noteth) (which I am sory you obserued not before you stumbled at these doubts) be any thing more conuenient,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hooker lib. 5. Page 152.</NOTE> then that our first admittance to the actuall receipt of his grace in the sacrament of Baptisme, should be consecrated with profession of beleefe, which is to the kingdome of God as a key, the want whereof excludeth Infidels both from that, and from all other sauing grace; And howsoeuer we say with S. Austin that <HI>Infants haue not a present Actuall habit of faith</HI> yet they haue then the <HI>foundation</HI> of that wherupon afterward they build, the first ground whereof was laid by the sacrament of Baptisme; so that without any <HI>madd presumption</HI> (as you tearme it) we may say truly of infants, that they are then <HI>beleeuers,</HI> because in Baptisme they <HI>begin</HI> to be, which continuance of time doth afterwarde make perfect. For if we call them beleeuers for their out|ward profession sake who are much further from faith then infants, why may we not without <HI>madnes</HI> or <HI>pre|sumption,</HI> account infants to haue faith which haue that grace giuen them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quem potue|runt illi nosse nec habere, isti potuerunt habere ante|quam nosse&punc; <HI>Aust.</HI></NOTE> which is the first and most effectual cause, out of which our beleeue groweth: and whilest others that know him beleeue not in him, these beleue in him before they know him. Now seeing then that Baptisme implyeth as Circumcision a couenant be|twixt God and his people, it is to be thought that as God in that sacrament bestoweth remission of sins &amp; the holy Ghost, binding himself as it were to bestow all other graces requisite in time to come; so euery in|fant receiuing the same sacrament at the hands of god

tyeth himselfe likewise for euer, to doe and beleeue what the Lord commaundeth. Now, who is there (considering this contract) that can blame either the interrogatories, or the suretyes which vndertake in this stipulation, seeing the thing is required, nay, inioyned with such necessity for the Church, to exclude infants, because they cannot by their owne tongues contract, were ouer rigorous: and not to take securitie at all, for those who cannot answere for themselues were to bee to carelesse; for the profession of faith, beeing ne|cessarie to a publike admittance into the house of God, what cause is there why suretyes may not law|fully doe it, seeing they know they are the children of fathfull Parents, and so consequently partakers of the promise, and that they are such as would make the same profession themselues, if they were of yeares, or that the Church should not require it, euen to put men in minde vpon what condition they admit them into the Church, and to manifest a reason, why they refuse others: so that for any thing I see alledged a|gainst it, as faith and repentance are necessarie to make the Sacraments effectuall, so this faith in this case is lawfully professed by the sureties, and effectuall for the infant, whome to accept into the Church without this, were to wrong the Sacrament, and not to receiue with this, were to wrong those infants, to whom the couenant belongeth by an euerlasting promise.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE></P>

Now to adde hereunto is to ordaine somewhat, as a thing absolutely necessary, &amp; pertaining to the essence of worshippe, and which so bindeth the conscience as the word it selfe, and there|fore they adde not to the word, which by the consent of the Church, do ordaine any ceremony in the exter|nall worship (obseruing the limitations of order, com|linesse, and edification) not as necessary, but as a thing indifferent and free, binding the conscience not out of the qualitie of the thing, but onely from hence, that it is commaunded: for as there are (as the schoolemen say) somethings which are <HI>mala quia prohibita,</HI> some|things which are <HI>prohibita quia mala,</HI> so there are some things <HI>mandata quia necessaria,</HI> some things <HI>necessaria quia mandata,</HI> of which kinde in Baptisme we account the crosse.</P>
<P>But as wee neither allowe vnmeete, nor purpose the stiffe defence of any vnnecessarie custome heretofore vsed in Baptisme, so wee knowe not yet any reason why infants should be the worse, if at their first admission

<P>Now it is plaine, that sauing the verie point of adoration and worship, with which popery crowned this Idoll, there is nothing ascribed to the crosse, in or out of Baptisme, by the ranckest Papists, but the fathers are as deeply ingaged in the same. So, if we vse it as the fathers, wee hold it to be so ne|cessary for our defence, as was the bloud of the passouer vpon the Israelites posts, or as the marke on their foreheads in the ninth of <HI>Ezechiell</HI> without which none can be safe. For so did the fathers, and we take the soule to be fenced by the cros|sing of the body, and the crosse to haue vertue of consecra|ting the sacrame~t or the childe: of driuing away diuels witch|craft and diseases, of strengthing against temptations. And if we will excuse the fathers by saying they spake thus rela|tiu&egrave;, with reference to the crosse of Christ and his death, nei|ther will all their speaches heare this releefe, nor haue we at all distanced them from the Papists, who say as much for themselues: and then what Popish superstition is that, from which we haue purged it? Specially if his maiestie were truely informed at the conference, that in Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tisme the Papists ne|uer ascribe any power or spirituall grace therto (as indeed he was not) witnesse their writers, and how either skilfully or negligently haue we vnder the faier name of the Primitiue and Apostolicall Churches, reduced it to that vse of holinesse and consecration, which in the name of the Papists could not haue beene borne: I confesse my Lord, I had rather thinke some committies to whom the penning of this Canon was be|trusted to haue failed therin then misdeeme all that reuerend assembly to haue intended such a meaning. But so long as this interpretation stands as the mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">de of our Church I shall

feare it iustly, knowing how vnder the couert of phrases, the maine points of trueth haue beene surprised, and therefore may be againe.

<HEAD>ANSERE.</HEAD>
<P>WHILST some men, in the sincerity of an vpright minde, haue laboured with humili|ty to giue satisfaction to contentious spirits, both those persons runne more speedily from vs, whom wee de|sire to ouertake, and also a common enemie surpriseth vs with aduantage, making vs to seeme in the eye of the world to bee of their minde, because with greater moderation we abstain from that veheme~t zeale to re|formation, that others more rashly are tra~sported with; so that in this case, the labour is neither easie nor safe. For to answere our brethren at home with that trueth and freedom, which both the cause and our loue to their persons doth chalenge from vs, is but to open the mouth of the common aduersarie, as if wee spake and thought as they doe, and out of this feare, to suppresse our answere, were with much weakenesse to betray the trueth.</P>
<P>This consideration, as it is not of small importance in the whole cause, so especially in this point con|cerning the crosse, where the diffence of a lawful ce|remony, may easily bee thought the erecting of that Idoll, whereunto the most superstitious in those later times haue beene corruptly perswaded to giue honor.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="73">For mine owne pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t in satisfaction to the Church of Christ (whereunto I owe the vttermost of that simple talent which GOD hath giuen mee) I Protest, that neither out of malice I oppugne our brethren at home, nor willingly would bee thought to Patronize the least errour of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI>; neither, I hope, hath any thing euer passed my pen with so sleight consideration since I was able to deale in this cause, whereof I cannot giue a suffici|ent reason that it is farre from the defence of any error of the <HI>Romish Church.</HI></P>
<P>And therefore in my opinion, the late Au|thour of the Protestantes Apologie hath dealt somewhat vnkindly with mee and others, to al|ledge vs as witnesses for their side, but most in|considerately, to the disaduantage of his owne cause, who now in the latter end beeing driuen from Scriptures, Fathers, and Councelles, are compelled to support themselues with the <HI>wres|ted mistaken Testimonies</HI> of such as haue and are willing to fight against them, and yet if wee erre of what valewe are our errours to conuince a trueth?</P>
<P>The daunger of this euill, if it were fully con|sidered by our brethren that will needes striue with vs, would make them forbeare all fur|ther contention in this cause; and Ioyne with our Church in cerimonyes, as they doe in doctrine, that all like the children of the same wombe might bee readye as with one heart and one voyce, to resist their subtill and malicious attempts, who vnder colour of Religion, and the Catholike faith, seeke treacherously the ruine, and subuer|sion
<PB N="133" REF="73">
both of this Church, and this common|welth.</P>
<P>And therfore (in the Iudgment of all wise, and religious men) vnexcusable is their paynes, and trauell, who extend their witts to the vtter|most of that they are able, to deriue an enuye vpon that gouerment, (as Infected with Popish superstition) wherein, hitherto they haue lo|uingly peaceably and plentifully bene brought-vp.</P>
<P>It seemeth that the vse of the Crosse in Bap|tisme offendeth not so much, as that the Infant by this means is dedicated to Gods seruice; because (say you) If dedicated (at which word you take all your offence) then either <HI>Initiated</HI> or <HI>consecrated</HI> (for the words in the Hebrewe doe onely signifie one of these two) of which if we graunt the first, you peremp|torily conclude that Baptisme is made voyde, if the second that then this signe is <HI>operatiue</HI> and hath ver|tue in it: and yet (say you) in the true vse of speach, to dedicate and to consecrate is all one; I am sorry that in matters of this consequence for which men can perswade themselues that it is warrantable to forsake their flockes, that at the last, the conclusion being summed vp, it should bee onely a contention of wordes; yet I must tell you that to speake properly, and as men of Iudgment haue done before vs; to conse|crate is to make of prophane thinges holy; to dedicate is when they are appoynted to some cer|tayne GOD;<NOTE PLACE="marg">P.

<PB N="122" REF="74">
<HI>Martyr</HI> saith, is nothing else but to apply to diuine &amp; religious vses, or to prepare himself to offer some thing to God.</P>
<P>Now if it may appeare (as doubtlesse it will) that not onely religious things were dedicated, but other things also, and that their dedication was in another kinde, without any worship diuine, but by first vsing; what in|conuenience wil follow, if in the whole action of bap|tisme, and those prayers that are vsed, the Infant be de|dicated, which in the canon is ascribed vnto the crosse, that being the onely externall cerimonie expressing the intention of the whole act? Thus <HI>Dauids</HI> house was dedicated, for which was made the thirtieth Psalme: the walles of a citie. <HI>Nehem.</HI> 12.27. were dedi|cated, which was nothing else, as <HI>P. Martyr</HI> saith, but that the wals of a citie being made vp, the people to|gether with the <HI>Leuites</HI> and Priests, and also the Princes went thither, and there gaue thanks vnto God, because the walle; were reedified, and prayed that the city might bee righteously vsed. This kinde of Dedication was called by the Hebrewes <HI>Canach.</HI> The other which was <HI>Chadash,</HI> was to consecrate things holy to God. Now, which of these you vnderstand to bee done by the crosse in Baptisme, it will not bee greatly material against vs, seeing the verie act of Dedication or conse|cration dependeth not vpon the signe of the crosse, but yet so said, because the crosse is an ancie~t significant co~|uenient signe of that act of dedication or consecration which is done in Baptisme, by the worde and prayer.</P>
<P>For our Dedication in Baptisme is as it were, a sur|re~dering of al that tight which our pare~ts, or our selues might haue in our selues into Gods hands: wherein as
<PB N="135" REF="74">
in the dedication both of the Temple and the Taber|nacle, God gaue a manifest signe that hee tooke posses|sion of both: so it standeth with reason, that on the In|fants behalfe, hereafter to put him in minde, and for the present to admonish those that are lookers on, that the minister signe him with that badge, which is the ensigne of his merit &amp; victory, whom the child must serue. The ancient vse of the crosse at all other times was for infidels, but in Baptisme for the good of be|leeuers, which is intended still: but as they haue done in this, so they exclude the crosse in the dedication of Temples, as if it were all one to build a house to God, and a parlour or Kitchin to our selues; wherin though I allow not greatly, the superstitious number of twelue in the building of Churches: yet I am not altogether of their opinion, who hold crosses vnmeete at the de|dication of Temples, which if some corruptly haue v|sed to a false end, wee cannot but mislike their super|perstitious intention, and yet retaine that warrantable signe, which wel becommeth that place, which ought to be the religious Schoole-house of Christs death. If wee may credit antiquity in the storie of <HI>Iulian,</HI> when hee looked the intrals of beasts (for south-saying,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sozo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. pag, 108.

<PB N="126" REF="75">
strength of his arme, even in that which they most contemned, shall wee then bee ashamed of that badge? or bee vnwilling to dedicate our selues vnto his seruice by that sygne, which was the note of his fearefull power to such as resisted his right hand, and so farre honored by the holy ghost that it often expresseth the whole meritt of his passion, by the bloode of the Crosse, so that if strange conclusi|ons be not vrged vpon vs, It is neither to make Bap|tisme voyde, to say wee are dedicated by the Crosse, (ascribing that to the signe which is done in the whole act) nor to make it, or Baptisme operatiue in that sence, to say that by Baptisme and so ma|nifested by that signe, we are consecrated to gods seruice, and that consequently, our <HI>dedication by this signe, is such as the auncyent fathers before poperye did vse.</HI></P>
<P>But least the Innocencye of the auncient tymes, should seeme to be a warrant for the simple vse of the Crosse among vs, (who thought it ever Honor and vertue enoughe to treade in the harme|les steppes of our forefathers) you laye an equall burthen for this corruption vpon them, as if <HI>nothing were ascribed to the Crosse, in or out of Baptisme by the rankest Papists (saving the very poynt of adorati|on) but the fathers are as deepely ingaged in the same</HI>; this If I had vttered, the Church of Rome would Iustly haue thought, that I had done them a great honor, in allowing their superstitious abuse of this signe, sauing onely in one poynt, to be the verye same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or vertue, and power, as the aun|cyenter fathers did ascribe vnto it; so that whilst you desire to make the Church of England as guilty
<PB N="137" REF="75">
of superstition in the vse of this signe, as they are now of the Church of Rome, you Inconsiderately and perhaps vntruely make the rankest papists no lesse Ignorant in that poynt, then the auncyentest and purest fathers haue bene before them: whatso|ever is capable of corruption (as the best thinges and actions wherein man concurreth, of necessity are) (for wee haue all corrupted our owne wayes) commeth not vpon the sodayne to that height of euill but that more evident markes of the former Integritye remaine, which in continuance of time, are not onely blemished, but whollye turned into another corrupt nature.</P>
<P>This is evident in that great and Antichris|tian defection of the trueth, which was not all eclipsed or ouershadowed at once; but Ig|norance breeding superstition; superstition never satisfying it selfe in the surmised acts of religion, but erring in the excesse, as prophanenes in the defect, hath added daylye to the first corrup|tions, that she is nowe as the heade of a smalle riuer, which sendeth forth but one streame, which cannot knowe her owne daughter in, continuance of time, being growne like vnto an Ocean, by the manyfold additions of sundrie and strainge wa|ters.</P>
<P>The Histories of former ages doe record vnto vs the beginning, the increase the perfecti|on of the grouth in the superstitious corrupti|ons of the Church of Rome; and howsoeuer all agree not, when this defection beganne, yet most men knowe, that there was a time in
<PB N="138" REF="76">
the priatiue age of our fathers, when few or none of the ceremonies of the Church were infected with such corruption as now they are. So that the seueritie of those is ouer great, who would wrap the fathers imme|diatly succeeding the Apostles time, with the same superstition (saue only in the point of adoration) wher|with the Papists are iustly accused to bee infected at this day: I confesse, when the Papists are charged by vs to haue corrupted the truth, by rehearsall of many false miracles done by the signe of the crosse, they al|ledge the testimonies of all fathers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bellar. Marshall.</NOTE> saying (which you confesse, but I doe not) that they haue esteemed no o|therwise of the crosse then the fathers of the Church haue done before them. Wee then say for sa|tisfaction in this point, that it had beene equall and right in you, before the imputation of so much corrup|tion to the blessed memory of those holy men, to haue showed what the Papists ascribe vnto the crosse, what the fathers, and what wee; No man can deny, but that God, after the death of his sonne, manifested his power to the amazement of the world in this contemptible signe, which peraduenture gaue iust occasion, beeing the instrument of so many miracles, that corrupter times, as those that succeeded were, did ouerburden it with fables and worshippe, the one false, the other I|dolatrous, both seruing to poyson the after ages with dangerous superstition: the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> at this present, differeth from the ancient fathers, as we differ from them, in making the very crosse wherupon Christ died, to bee a relick, and all other crosses to be as Ima|ges: and lastly the vere figure made in the ayre, to haue a spirituall and diuine vertue, to cast out diuels and to worke miracles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beller. lib. 2. de Imag. cap. 30.</NOTE> and as <HI>Bellermine</HI> saith <HI>Terret &amp; fu|gat
<PB N="139" REF="76">
daemones, pellit morbos, &amp; omnia mala; sanctificat ea quibus imprimitur</HI>; which vertues or some of which, if God manifested in the crosse in the dayes of our fore|fathers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sanctit as acce|dit rebus cum signantium cru|ce.</NOTE> to ascribe the same vnto now, is not to say truly as they fathers did, but superstitiouslie to err with the church of Rome, as if the power of healing which followed annoynting in the primitiue church, might be a warrant either for the annointing vsed a|mongst papists at this day, or imbolden any man to say that nothing is ascribed by the rankest papist (for that is your phrase) to annointing, but the fathers are as deeply ingaged in the same; so that whilst our church professeth the vse hereof as the fathers did, they neither tie themselues to the example of all, nor can be iustly denyed to haue the warrant of the soun|dest fathers for the vse hereof. For the moderate vse as now it is retayned in the church of England seemeth to be an apostolicall constitution, being accounted as a thing auncyently &amp; generally receiued in Tertulli|ans time, who was within two hundred yeares after Christ, and within lesse then a hundred yeares after, Saint <HI>Iohn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Conser. pag.</HI> 73 74.</NOTE> in which shortnes of time, it were Iniury to think, that a superstitious Idolatry, should gaine that honor, to be accounted an <HI>auncyent</HI> and a <HI>reuere~d sygne.</HI> And therefore in my opinion lesse excusable is their fault, who laye the imputation of false dealing with his maiestie by the Bishops at the conference, be+ing informed (but as you say) (<HI>vntruly</HI>) <HI>that the papists neuer ascribe any power or spirituall grace in Baptisme vn|to the Crosse</HI>; surely wisedome must account it if not ma+lice, yet great rashnes to giue the ly to those reuerend persons, in answere whereof I only say thus much; that what the Bishops had informed his maiestie in this

<P>My last exception about the sacrament is about the knee|ling at the co~munion, which for my owne part I neuer stuck at, as at a thing vnlawfull to be vsed, because it is admini|stred with a prayer ouer euerie receiuer, and for that it is not vnlawfull, nor (if superstition had not staynd it) vnfit to take such a token of Gods fauour (aswell as the fauours of a prince) vpon our knees. But my reuerend Lord this so ex|treame vrging of it, in the Canon as to make the only omiss|ion of it (in a poore man who of a tender conscience and in detestation of the late popish and Idolatrous vse thereof shall forbeare it) so deepe a cause of seperating a man from all part in Christs death, as that the minister himselfe shalbe suspended if he suffer him to co~municate, seemes a charge of more waight, then an indifferent cerimonie should beare, &amp; such as thrusteth me~ vpon a breach of gods commaundeme~t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. <HI>15.6.</HI> Zanch. compe. de Trad.

And if the punishment of excommunication be thought by any ouer greeuous for the omission of so indifferent a ce|remonie (which in your opinion is a small offe~ce) you must know that wise men cannot account the offence small, where the disobedience is great; and the disobedience cannot be little, where there is a contempt of those lawes which the church doth make: nay as the seruants answered Nahaman the Sy+rian, if you had beene commaunded any great thing especially in the humility of our soules to

receiue so great a benefit, ought we not to haue done it? and therefore howsoeuer we pitty their case, yet vn|excusable is the error of those men who chuse rather to want the food of their soule by this blessed sacra|ment, then to receiue the sacrament prostrate vpon their knees, as if an opinio~ of that superstitio~ wherwith some others had stayned it, could hurt him that knee|leth in obedience and humility, especially knowing his owne heart to be vpright in that point, and seeing no reason sinisterly to suspect the vertuous intentio~ of this church which professeth an vtter abolishing of al superstitious ceremonies.

And amongst those manifould misteries which accompanyed the King into this land, this is not the least, that when a strong continuance of a setled truth, dispersing all wandering opinions vnder a learned prince, was more then hope|fully assured to be the blessing of our Land, that then, euen then there should be an increase both of papists and puritans, as if both had discouered an extraordina|ry fauour, to be showed to either; but I can better satis|fie my selfe in those of the church of Rome, then in the other, for all men in afflictio~ (which surely though

And therefore without any other answere, we will only put you in minde of those harsh speeches, which may peraduenture in this discontent|ment be agreeable to your fancie, but are no way su|table to your cause, nor verie well beseeming a man of your place.

in your case like fathers with their owne children, lea|uing nothing vnattempted to reforme your opinion, before they proceeded to giue sentence.

<P>Wherein if both partes remayne equally stiffe in their owne opinions, a mutinie must fol|low for want of Discipline: sometimes I confesse <HI>va|rietie</HI> and <HI>alteration</HI> of <HI>cerimonies</HI> are thought fit; both to shew the authoritie of the Church, (for you selfe haue confessed when you read your articles <HI>that eue|rie particuler or nationall Church hath authoritie to or|dayne,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Articles of</HI> 156. <HI>Artic.</HI> 34.</NOTE> <HI>change, and abolish ceremonies, or rites of the Church ordained onely by mans authoritie, so that all things bee done to aedifying.</HI>) Secondly, that they are but furthe|rances of deuotion, and no partes of diuine wor|ship.</P>
<P>But when they are established as thought fit for <HI>de|cencie, edification,</HI> and <HI>order,</HI> by such as haue au|thoritie from Christ to moderate those thinges: then by inferiour persons (such as wee are) eyther to bee <HI>oppugned, misconstrued, despised,</HI> or <HI>disobeyed,</HI> it is daungerouslye, to kindle a fyre of Rebellion in the principall parts of Gods house. But that which followeth, is much worse.</P>
<P><HI>O my good Lord, will it not bee enough to keepe safe and well fenced your Iurisdictions and personall digni|ties? not enough to deuide the Honours to your selues, and labours to vs?</HI> Haue the last Canons no other end, <HI>but to fence the Iurisdictions, and personall digni|ties vnto the B B.</HI> Doubtlesse the diminishing of their honors, which could neuer haue been without wrong

vnto the Church, was little to be feared (though the Canons had not beene) where so wise a King ruled ouer vs, who had throughly tasted the cala|mities and miseries of that Church, which placed the greatest part of their Zeale in suppressing of Bishops; and whilest they laboured that none might haue too much, they presently brought it so to passe that scarce any had what was reasonable enough: besides if you knew the vnwearied paines, the in|tollerable burthens, that diuers of the Reuerend Fa|thers, who watch ouer vs dayly, sustayne for the peace and the happinesse of this Church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Episcopi.</NOTE> you would plainely acknowledge preaching not to be the grea|test paines, and that it is a misdeeming of their care to thinke, <HI>That they haue deuided the honours to them|selues, and the labours to you.</HI> Surely there is no greater or more vehement exercise of faith amon|gest so many perils, then prayers for the publicke peace of the Church, and it is our parts to vnderstand those perils, and to iudge them to appertaine to our owne safeties.</P>
<P>Besides it is our dutie to ascribe to the Magis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rates, <HI>Wisedome</HI> and <HI>Iustice,</HI> that is, that wee doe not pre|ferre our priuate iudgements before the lawes, and decrees of the Church, but obey them: This ho|nour is most agreeable to publicke peace, not to ca|uill against the lawes, nor to interprete them with <HI>Iea|lousie</HI> or <HI>Enuie</HI>; but to <HI>couer,</HI> to <HI>excuse,</HI> and <HI>mitigate</HI> the ouer-sightes of Magistrates and lawes if there be any. This as it is in priuate the ornament of a Christian, so it is in publicke the honour of a good subiect.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1, Cor. 13 Coloss. 3</NOTE> <HI>Loue beareth all things: Loue is the bond of perfection,</HI> to pre|uent dissolutions of a Church or a commonwealth.

And heerein if the requisite seueritie which the pal|sie of the Church exacteth from the Reuerend Fa|thers, draw them to punish, whom they desire to fa|uour, to aduance and cherish, it is not a casting out of borne Israelites (as you terme it) but a iust repre|hension, setting a marke vpon that sonne, that hath made no conscience to discouer the supposed naked|nesse of his owne father.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">.</NOTE> In whose place it any <HI>wild beasts</HI> (Papists you meane) <HI>shall multiply,</HI> I doubt not but their religious care, will be as readie to suppresse the one, as depriue the other: And if in the ende (as you prophesie) (which God forbid) vnfortunately it happen, that the Bishops shall want you, as King <HI>Henry</HI> did <HI>Cromewell,</HI> it shall be much safer to indure the hazard of those times, then to buy an aduan|tage at so deare a price. In the meane time beleeue (which it is fit for you to acknowledge) <HI>that if you for|beare vpon the poynt of Conscience, their Lordshipps haue better reasons for that they do, then to stand vpon termes of their owne pleasures.</HI> Now to conclude this vnpleasing worke, which wee laid aside, in hope to haue rested without trouble, vntill such time as we saw their bookes of this argument to increase still, and heard that as much of this as was then printed, was by them confuted; wee desire all men to think of vs, as of those that account the infirmities of our brethren our owne harmes, and the modest directions of men as meane as our selues, to be no blemish vnto vs, who propound not <HI>victory,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A prayer.</NOTE> <HI>but truth, and the Churches peace.</HI> The God of all loue, and the giuer of all graces multiply his bles|sings vpon this land, let them be poured (O Lord) as an oyntment vpon the Kings head, strengthen the weake hands of the reuerend fathers, the chiefe buil|ders
