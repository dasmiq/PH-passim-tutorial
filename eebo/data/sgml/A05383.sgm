<P>_MAy it please you, Cha|rity
is the great office
of Christianity and
humanity: for the
lawes of God and na|ture
inioyne all men
the workes of common profite. There|fore
<PB REF="3">
is action better then contemplati|on,
because this doth respect our pri|uate

into the common Treasure of mens
prosperities.</P>
<P>This cause hath made mee vnder|take
these paines. For though I am yet
vnprofest in any particular place of
charge, eyther in the Church or state,
whereby I might imploy (my little) to
more aduantage, yet my very being a
Christian doth challenge from me the
best performance I can, for the commo~
good.</P>
<P>The reasons of my dedication are
these. First, there is non of you to whom
I owe not some respect of duty, but to
you two Principals, principall respects;
the whole Kingdome being in debt to
your labours, which God make pros|perous
to his glory; and for the honour
of (this our little world) great Brittaine.
Againe, I did purpose you a booke,
which might haue done some seruice
to your princely charge, and in whose
argument I did professe to bee much
more able then in this. That beeing
<PB REF="3">
(for a time) stayed from printing, by
their authority in the State, that may
commaund mee, I haue presumed with
this (such as it is) intreating you to giue
it your allowance of fauour, because I
freely cast it into the common Trea|sure.</P>
<P>God make all your labours respect
the glory of his name, that you may
liue in the honour of his seruice, and
obtaine the reward of faithfulnesse.</P>

<HEAD>The Preface to the
Reader.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_CHristian Reader, the visi|ble
Church is compared to
a Vineyard, God is the ma|ster
of it, his Ministers are
his Labourers, his people
his vines. Our great Maister God, giueth
his entertainement to none but labourers:
yet in this Vineyard are both loyterers and
lookers on. The true Labourers are they
who in that sacred profession faithfully en|deuour
their best diligence. And these bles|sed
ones shall receyue from God, this happy
sentence:</HI> It is well done, good &amp; faith|full
seruants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 25. 21, 23.</NOTE> yee haue been faithfull in
little, I will make you rulers ouer much:
enter yee into your Maisters ioy.</P>
<P>The loyterers are halfe labourers. These
are like the Scribes and Pharisees, that <HI>sitte
in</HI> Moses <HI>seate,</HI> but walke not in his stepps.
<PB REF="5">
And <HI>their voice is</HI> Iacobs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 27. 22</NOTE> <HI>but their ha~ds
are</HI> Esaues: their words are holy, but their
workes are prophane, they can deliuer the
doctrines of the Gospell, but not liue in the
duties of the law. And to these will God
be terrible in the day of tryall, &amp; tell them
that though they haue cast out Diuels, and
done wonders in his name; yet he wil deny
them for his,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 7. 22. 23.</NOTE> &amp; bid them <HI>depart</HI> (because)
<HI>they are workers of iniquity.</HI></P>
<P>The lookers on are of two sorts, they are
either <HI>nolentes,</HI> or <HI>non valentes.</HI> The
first sort are such as can, but will not labor
in their spirituall office; these are they that
loue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ase, and fat themselues with prospe|rity,
and then (like <HI>Acsops hen</HI>) they are
so fat they cannot lay, and like that rich
foole in the Gospel, that said vnto his soule,
<HI>Soule,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 12. 19.</NOTE> <HI>thou hast much goods layd vp
for many yeers, liue at ease, eate, drink,
and take thy pastime.</HI> But God will de|ride
such folly, and tell them that their life
is but a dayes length. <HI>For at night their
soules shal be taken from them,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Verse 20.</NOTE> <HI>&amp; then
whose shall all those thinges bee that
they haue prouided?</HI></P>
<P>The last and least worthy in Gods vine|yard,
<PB REF="5">
are such as neyther will nor can dis|charge
the dutyes of their place. These idle
Priestes, are like Idoll Gods t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">at represent
those things which (indeed) they are not.
And to these will Christ say, as in the Pa|rable
of the marriage:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 12. 12</NOTE> <HI>Friends how came
yee in hither, which haue no wedding
garment?</HI> And doubtlesse it cannot but
bee a very desperate presumption to vnder|take
this charge without some conuenient
proportion of sufficiency. Now if any man
aske mee how came these thinges thus to
passe? I will answere with the Gospell. <HI>The
enuious man hath done this.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 13. 28.</NOTE> The Diuel
that wretch enuying the prosperity of the
Gospell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Verse 30.</NOTE> hath sowne his tares among Gods
wheate, which must grow vp together, vn|till
the day of the generall haruest.</P>
<P>By this little of muc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">, mayest thou vnder|stand
(Christian Reader) in what fashion
the world is now suted: the greater num|ber
of men, turning their eyes of care from
<HI>God</HI> and <HI>Religion,</HI> to looke to things of
this world, with affectation. But bee thou
perswaded, that whatsoeuer he bee, of what
estate, degree, or condition soeuer, that doth
not respect God, and the common cause of
<PB REF="6">
religion, more then his owne priuate, hee
may happly haue the name of a Christian,
but doubtlesse, he hath the mark of a repro|bate,
and God will both despise and iudge
him in the generall day. For in this case are
men disposed as <HI>Iobs</HI> cattell were: <HI>His
Oxen were plowing,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob. 1. 14</NOTE> <HI>and his Asses fee|ding.</HI>
So the better sort of men do euer tra|uell
the common cause, but the worse their
owne particular onely, and therefore wor|thy
a worse comparison then <HI>Iobs</HI> asses.
This knowledge haue I thought fitte to giue
thee by way of admonition, that thou mayest
pitty the common cause, and bee zealously
affected in thy self with a desire of thy own
reformation. God succeede thee in all thy
works of holines, and may it be his pleasure
that these poore labours of mine may bee
some cause of thy reducing. </P>

<HEAD>Of GOD. Chap. 1.</HEAD>
<P>_WHen I first beganne to vn|derstand
of GOD, I had
this imagination: that
God was a general power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The gene|rall know|ledge of GOD.</NOTE>
with-in whose Circle all
things are, without whom
nothing; by whome all things were made,
and to whome all men owe theyr seruice.</P>
<P>This learning was taught mee by the
wisedome of my Naturall soule, and
by the common example of Christi|ans:
for all men acknowledge a God,
<PB N="2" REF="9">
and all Christians this dutie. This is
the common knowledge, but not the
profitable; more commendable in Phi|losophers
then Christians: being with|out
vse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How to know God, with vse.</NOTE> without application. I haue
therefore better endeuored my selfe,
and studied to know God my God: to
knowe him in his Diuine nature, in the
Trinitie of persons, and in their offices;
for thus to knowe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To know Gods na|ture.</NOTE> and then to appre|hend
and applie, is saluation. To know
<HI>GOD</HI> in his nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His attri|butes.</NOTE> wee must know his
attributes; all which may bee reduced
to these two generals, Iustice and Mer|cie:
in all which we must consider him
to be infinite; infinite in wisedome, in|finite
in fauour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Tri|nitie.</NOTE> infinite in power, infi|nite
in time. The Trinitie is the di|stinction
of persons without diuiding
the substance or nature of God: the Fa|ther,
Sonne, and holie Ghost, though
they bee three distinct in Name, they
are one in power, without diuision,
without inequalitie. The Sonne begot|ten
as ancient as the Father; the holie
Ghost proceeding from both, equall
with both; no prioritie in their omni|tencie;
<PB N="3" REF="9">
but all of them being alike able
in all things, alwayes conspiring one
end without discord.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The foun|dation of Religion.</NOTE> This diuine my|stery
is the foundation of Christian re|ligion,
without which there is no faith,
no saluation.</P>
<P>It is further necessary to know the Tri|nitie
in their seuerall offices; for though
the Godhead be so vndeuided,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The seueral offices in the Trini|tie.</NOTE> as that
no one person in the Trinitie doth
work without cooperation, the Father,
Sonne, and holy-Ghost conspyring in
euery acte of euery seuerall person; yet
in the wisedome of their owne Decree,
they haue determined to the seuerall
persons of the Trinitie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Trini|tie con|spire in eue|rie worke.</NOTE> seuerall execu|tions
of Offices: wherein though the
whole <HI>TRINITIE</HI> co~spire, yet some
one Person in the Trinitie hath the
name of Principall:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Crea|tor.</NOTE> therefore we say,
<HI>GOD</HI> the Father made the World, the
Sonne redeeemed it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Crea|tion ascri|bed to God the Father, the Sonne, and holy Ghost, coo|perating.</NOTE> the Holie Ghost
doth gouerne it. The Creation of the
world is ascribed to God the Father, yet
hee made the world, and the workes
therein by his Word. This Word was
God, the second person in the Trinitie,
<PB N="4" REF="10">
who did cooperate &amp; worke with God
in the Creation. The holie Ghost also
moued vpon the Waters, to diuide the
Seas and distinguish light: all of them
ioyntly and seuerally executing the De|crees
of their owne diuine councell.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Redemp|tion ascri|bed to God the Sonne.</NOTE></P>
<P>The worke of Redemption is properlie
ascribed to Christ, the second Person,
who descended his Maiestie, and in his
owne person came to make a conquest,
of Sinne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Father and the ho|lie Ghost cooperating The holie Ghost doth gouerne the Word.</NOTE> Hell, and Death: Yet in this
most gracious work, the Father and the
holie Ghost were not absent, but gaue
diuine assistance to our Blessed Sauiour
<HI>IESVS.</HI> Christ when hee ascended,
left the holie Ghost to be a patrone to
the Catholique Church, the which in
all occasions doth support euery mem|ber
of the same; yet the Father and the
Sonne haue their hands of prouide~ce,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Father and the Sonne assi|sting.</NOTE> at
all times working with the holy Ghost,
in this diuine gouernement. Therefore
howsoeuer they haue seuerall assigne|ments,
by themselues appoynted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">One la|bour, one honour in the Trini|tie.</NOTE> yet
they all conspire in euery worke of ho|linesse,
all of them participating one la|bour,
one honour.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="10">Thus to know God is needfull for e|uery
soule that desireth happinesse, or
that coueteth to haue part in the righ|teousnes

<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<HEAD>The Vse.</HEAD>
<P><HI>GOD</HI> beeing then of a Nature infi|nitely
good,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The vse&punc;</NOTE> infinite great, it ought to
moue in euery soule a double affection,
loue, and feare: to feare him because he

men to an imitation of <HI>GOD:</HI> that such

which only is able to make the great

<P>Againe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vse 2.</NOTE> <HI>GOD</HI> is a power, distingui|shed

<PB N="6" REF="11">
and euery person <HI>GOD,</HI> all of them con|spiring
the same ends from Eternitie to

condition of men. Princes and the
great on Earth, are called Gods; these
ought (like God) to combine them|selues
in holy action,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal, 82. 6.</NOTE> and to bend their
power against the enemies of God and
man, sinne and the sinnefull; and not
with implacable displeasure to destroy
themselues,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Such as are meerely po|liticke, and respect greatnesse without goodnes.</NOTE> their estates with ciuill dis|agreements.
For though God say,
they are Gods, hee saith, they shall dye
like men: and if euill men, they are
then no Gods, but diuels, enemyes to
God, enemies to the good. And as in
the nature of God, mercy doth triumph
and hath preheminence: so in all the
godlie, there is a gratious pittie, with
which they are most affected,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mercie the best proofe of goodnes.</NOTE> and God

</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<HEAD>Speciall Application.</HEAD>
<P>When I had thus considered the na|ture
of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Speciall ap|plication.</NOTE> his omnipotencie, his mer|cie,
<PB N="7" REF="11">
and other attributes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This care is euery mans dutie.</NOTE> it caused me to
question my owne life, and search the

I vnderstood the truth of my miserie;
that I was guiltie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mans de|serrs.</NOTE> and deserued death
and torment, and that the Iustice of
God would giue sentence against mee.
Then was the knowledge of Gods Ma|iestie
a terror to me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The effects of a guiltie conscience.</NOTE> I conceiued in my
feare the very formes of his indignati|on,
and I beganne to feele in my soule
the very torment of condemnation; as
if God had giuen sentence, and my
soule in the sense of execution. In this
astonishment I remembred mercie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mercie giues hope in greatest extremities.</NOTE> and
that God was so delighted in the vse
thereof, as that hee carefully watcheth
cause and opportunity to giue it. I did
therefore acknowledge and submit my
selfe to fauour: God did descend his
greatnesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acknow|ledgement|most neces|sarie.</NOTE> accepted my acknowledge|ment,
and gaue me the allowance of his

what my Sauiour had done for the re|demption

promised the Faithfull, what the peni|tent.
I belieued, receyued strength,
<PB N="8" REF="12">
and had my Hope established:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The promi|ses that be|long to the faithful, and penitent onely.</NOTE> and
growing bolde with these encourage|ments,
I desired &amp; obtained the Sonne
of God, to restore mee the Spirite of
God, to continue mee restored, refor|med.
Then could my soule receiue con|tent
in Diuine meditations; then I
could despise the earthly profites, and
the vaine pleasures of men:<NOTE PLACE="marg">How to vn|dersta~d the world.</NOTE> call them,
and esteeme them as dongue, filthy, and
that maketh filthie. Then I could

some alteration;<NOTE PLACE="marg">All worldly things sub|iect to alte|ration.</NOTE> so that nothing in the

of Angels,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The na|ture, the office of Angels. The nature of their sub|stance, Their qua|lity. Power. Their of|fice.</NOTE> is their nature, their office.
In their nature must be co~sidered what

In their quality is considered
their power; being at all times, and vp|on

not that hee needeth their

against their wils to his obedie~ce: these
seuerall imployments of the good and

Now to proue the substa~ce of this do|ctrine
by the testimonie of Scripture,
I might enlarge my selfe with the num|ber
of authorities; the which because
they are frequent, I will produce only
somefew, such as may satifie doubt.
In the 104. Psalme, the Prophet admi|ring
<PB N="24" REF="20">
and praising God for his wonder|full
creating and gouerning the Word,
in the fourth vers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 104. 4.</NOTE> he saith: <HI>God made the
spirits,</HI> (that is, the Angels) <HI>Messengers,
and a flaming fire his Ministers.</HI> This verse
is againe alledged by the author to the
<HI>Hebrewes:</HI> who to proue the prehemi|nence
of the Sonne of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hebr. 1. 6.</NOTE> saith: that
<HI>all the Angels worship him,</HI> and proueth by
the testimonie of the Prophet <HI>Dauid,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hebr. 1. 7.</NOTE>
that Angels are but <HI>Messengers,</HI> or <HI>Mi|nisters:</HI>
&amp; that they are of a substance
like fire or pure aire. By which testimo|nie
is proued both the nature and the
office of Angels: their nature, that they
are spirits like fire; their office, that they
are Ministers of Messengers. Their of|fice
is againe repeated in the 14. verse:
<HI>Are they not all Ministring Spirites,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Verse. 14.</NOTE> <HI>sent
forth to minister for their sakes, which shall
be heires of saluation;</HI> by which is decla|red
the purpose of their ministration &amp;
seruice: that is, for the benefite of Gods
Elect, both to preuent the enemie, and
to further them in their holie exercise.
To prooue the power of Angells, wee
may remember what God by an An|gell
<PB N="25" REF="20">
did for the <HI>Israelites</HI> in <HI>Egipt;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 14.</NOTE> what
he did when he brought them out by an
Angell.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. King. 12. 35.</NOTE> God destroyed of <HI>Saneheribs</HI>
Hoast in one Night 185000.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. 6. 16.</NOTE> An An|gell
preserued <HI>Daniell</HI> from the Lyons:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 12. 7.</NOTE>
deliuered the Apostles out of Prison:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. 3. 23.</NOTE>
the three Children from the Fornace:
the Scripture is full of the demonstrati|ons
of theyr powerfull acts, God wor|king
his admirable effects by the seruice
of his Angells. Againe, if wee reduce
to memorie, the most memorable of all
Gods mercies, we shall finde that in the
execution, his Angels are eyther Mini|sters,
or Messengers, and often both.</P>
<P>To omit all other particulars, that most
worthie, most meritorious and happie:
the Redemption of mankinde, by the
birth, and by the death of Iesus Christ;
were not the Angells continuall wor|kers
in that ministration? God sent his
Angell <HI>Gabriell</HI> to bring the first newes
thereof,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 1. 26. &amp;c.</NOTE> to the most blessed Virgin <HI>Ma|rie.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 29.</NOTE>
Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 2. 13.</NOTE> as soone as Christ was
borne of the Virgin, the holie Angell
did publish and preach it to the Shep|heards;
multitudes of Heauenly Soldi|ers
<PB N="26" REF="21">
praysing and magnifying God for
so great a benefite. How often did the
Angels visit and comfort our Sauiour?
The Diuell could acknowledge that
God had giuen his Angels charge to
prouide,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 4. 10. 11.</NOTE> that his Son should not hurt
his foot (that is) should not perish in
the least particular. Christ being in
his agony vpon the mount, there appea|red
an Angell to him, comforting him.
At his resurrection the Angels attend,
and are the first publishers of that bles|sed
newes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 22. 43. 44.</NOTE> Lastly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 24. 4.</NOTE> at his ascension the
holy Angelles attend to bring him
to the bosome of his Father,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 1. 10. 11.</NOTE> comfor|ting
the Apostles with the promise of
his returne. Thus wee see by testimony
of Scripture, what the Angels are, what
their office is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The graci|ous disposi|tion of good An|gels.</NOTE> and how they are affe|cted;
of so gracious a disposition, &amp; so
inclinable to the good of men, that
<HI>they haue ioy and consolation in Hea|uen

of a sinner.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 15. 7. 10.</NOTE> Therefore in all re|spects
of noblenesse and excellency,
they are the most Soueraigne of all
creatures, whom God hath ordained
<PB N="27" REF="21">
to be continual wayters in his holy pre|sence.</P>
<P>It is by many doubted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A question.</NOTE> by some de|maunded,
whether men may not law|fully
implore the fauor and assistance of
angels: for in their reasons it dooth
seeme equall, that seeing God hath gi|uen
his Angels the charge of his elect,
&amp; hath made them <HI>ministring Spirites,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 1. 14. The angels haue a charge of holy men.</NOTE>
<HI>for their sakes which shall bee heyres of sal|uation,</HI>
that therefore they implore
their gracious protection, giue some
acknowledgement of thanks to the ho|ly
Angels, by whom they haue helpe
&amp; supportation, in the passage of their
Christian pilgrimage.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The answer. First.</NOTE> To answer this,
there is a double doubt to be resolued.
First, I doubt whether euery faithfull
christian man &amp; woman, haue one par|ticular
Angell assigned them, and whe|ther
that Angel he at all times continu|ally
present. Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Secondly, These doubts can|not be sa|tisfied.</NOTE> whether the
Angels of God not present, can heare
the prayers of men directed to them.
The first, that euery man hath his An|gell
assigned him, was neuer yet sub|stantially
proued: and that angels ab|sent
<PB N="28" REF="22">
should be able to heare our praiers
present, is dangerous to acknowledge;
lest therby we take diuinity from God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">We must not take from God to giue his Angels.</NOTE>
and giue it to his Angels. And where|as
they reinforce this argument with
some examples in the Scripture, as in
the 48. of <HI>Genesis,</HI> the 16. <HI>verse,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 48. 16.</NOTE> where <HI>Ia|cob</HI>
blessing the sonnes of <HI>Ioseph,</HI> sayth:
<HI>The Angell which hath deliuered me from
all euill,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">An answere to an obie|ction.</NOTE> <HI>blesse the children, &amp;c.</HI> It is an|swered,
that by Angell, <HI>Iacob</HI> here vn|derstandeth
God. Againe, if the words
will not beare that construction, but
that it must bee graunted to bee an
Angel, the messenger or Minister of al|mighty
God;<NOTE PLACE="marg">God giues his speciall favour to speciall and choyse par|ticulars.</NOTE> it is not therefore gran|ted,
that euery Christian hath the like
degree of fauour as <HI>Iacob</HI> had; he be|ing
a speciall select, by whom God
would declare himselfe to be wonder|full,
giuing him extraordinary degrees
of fauour, and extraordinary protecti|on.
Therefore the Angell of God did
oftentimes assist him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quaere.</NOTE> both in his
griefe, and hopes; the Angell presen|ting
himselfe to <HI>Iacob</HI> in a visible form;
and <HI>Iacob</HI> wrastling with the Angel, the
<PB N="29" REF="22">
which familiarity hath not been gran|ted
but to some choyse particulars on|ly.
And <HI>Iacob</HI> doth not direct his prai|er
to the Angell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">We may pray to God, for the prote|ction of an|gels, but not to the an|gels for Gods pro|tection.</NOTE> but to God, that the
Angel might protect his grandchildre~;
and in praying for this extraordina|ry
blessing for his children, he doth not
conclude that therefore euery Christi|an
man hath the like extraordinary fa|uour.
They are therefore dangerously
deceyued, who for giuing the holy An|gels
their demonstrations of thankes,
giue them adoration and diuine wor|ship;
&amp; so coueting to please, displease
the holy Angels that attend them.</P>
<P>This is one extremity; there is ano|ther,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Another extremity.</NOTE>
and that is a remisnesse: when
men acknowledge no reuerence, no re|spect
to the dignity of holy angels. The
holy men of all ages at the sight of an
Angel would vse extraordinary respect
of humility &amp; reuerence.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A reverence due to holy angels.</NOTE> <HI>Abraha~</HI> he bo|wed
himself in reuerence to the ground
and called the Angell Lord:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 18. 2. 3.</NOTE> so like|wise
in the example of all the godly.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Obiection.</NOTE>
And though men obiect that in these
times the angels do not present them|selues,
<PB N="30" REF="23">
(as in the old world) in visible
formes; and therefore they neede no
reuerence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Answer.</NOTE> there being no knowledge
of their presence. I answer, that though
they appeare not in formes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The angels often pre|sent with vs in their spi|rituall na|ture.</NOTE> yet they
are notwithstanding, often present in
their spirituall natures: which though
our corporall eyes cannot discerne, yet
a spirituall iudgement and holy medi|tation
will remember vs. And this is
answerable to the iudgement of <HI>Saint
Paul,</HI> who would haue men and wo|men
vse decency and respect, euen
because of the angels.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 11. 10.</NOTE> <HI>Therefore</HI> (saith

the end of mans Creation
which is for the glory and honour of
God that made him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isay. 43. 7.</NOTE> <HI>Euery one shall be
called by my name, for I created him for
my glory, formed him &amp; made him.</HI> These
particulars are most materiall, and of
nearest consideration in the creation of
man, and because of their importance,
I will somewhat dilate vpon euery par|ticular.
First of the aduise and delibera|tion
God vsed when hee formed man:
God sayd, <HI>Let vs make man.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 1. 26.</NOTE> When he
created the World, and the Workes
therein, he sayde, <HI>Let there be,</HI> and there
were; but when hee commeth to make
<PB N="38" REF="27">
man, he sayth, <HI>Let vs make</HI> by whom he
putteth a difference betwixt man and
euery other creatur,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The diffe|rence God made be|tween man and his o|ther c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">|tures.</NOTE> that as man should
excell all other in the excellency of
his nature, and in the purpose of his
end; so God would honour him aboue
all in the manner of his Creation. <HI>Let
vs,</HI> that is, the three persons in the Tri|nity,
the Father, Son, and holy Ghost;
the which at the making of man, are
personally vnderstood: at the creating
of the world, they are not personally,
but generally vnderstood, in the vnity
of their Godhead,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> For so I vnderstand
the words of Gods creating, <HI>Let there
bee,</HI> to be meant by the Godhead indi|uisible;
the words, <HI>Let vs make,</HI> to bee
meant by the persons distinguished.
And though no man can bee able to
giue a reason of the secret will of God:
yet this may bee imagined,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A supposed reason of Gods secret will.</NOTE> that seeing
the world and all the creatures therein
(saue man) haue only a generall respect
to the honour of God, &amp; therfore were
they by the generall power of Gods
diuinity created: but man (being de|termined
in the counsell of God) that
<PB N="39" REF="27">
hee should bee an occasion that the
whole Trinity should haue diuine ex|ercise
in the gouernement of his life;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Tri|nity haue divine exer|cise in the governe|ment of man.</NOTE>
and euerie one in their seuerall assigne|ments,
as should please themselues to
appoint: therefore God (in the Trini|ty
of persons) made man, because af|terwardes
in the Trinity of persons
hee was to gouerne him. God he gaue
man a law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">God the Father gaue man a law.</NOTE> which he being not able to
keepe, did condemne him. Christ the
second person, moderateth the law, &amp;
giueth the Gospell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ mo|derateth the law, and giveth the Gospell. The holy Ghost mo|ueth grace.</NOTE> promising saluati|on
to all that will beleeue. The holy
Ghost he moueth in the harts of Gods
elect, and giueth grace to apprehend
by faith, the meanes of saluation. Thus
are they personally busied in the go|uernement
and preseruation of man;
thus were they personally at his Crea|tion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The mat|ter of mans creation. The diffe|rence God made in the creation between man and all other creatures.</NOTE></P>
<P>The second consideration, is the
matter of mans creation. And this in a
double respect is considerable, in the
person of God; first, God when he for|med
other creatures, hee required no
matter, but gaue them beeing by his
<PB N="40" REF="28">
word. But when hee formed man, hee
first prepared his matter, then gaue the
forme, and created man. Wherin God
doth vse a double care, a double dili|gence;
not that hee could not create
man of nothing as he had the rest of his
creatures, but he did it in the wisedome
of his diuinity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The rea|son why God made man of a preexistent matter.</NOTE> for respect and cause|full
consideration. First, to expresse his
double, or rather his manifold affecti|on
to that creature. Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Secondly.</NOTE> to pre|uent
the proude imagination, man
might haue of the noblenesse of his
nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The natu|rall pride of flesh.</NOTE> it being yet in the pride of our
flesh; to boast our descent, and to de|riue
our families from antiquity and
greatnesse.</P>
<P>The third consideration is the di|stinguishing
forme of man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The forme of man his soule.</NOTE> his reaso|nable
soule, whereby God doth distin|guish
him from all the Creatures of
earth, giuing him reason and discourse
to in able him for the gouernement of
the world. This is considerable in
these respects. First, the order God ob|serued
in the creation: God first made
the world, afterwards hee made man,
<PB N="41" REF="28">
and gaue him the possession.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The order God vsed at the ma|king of man.</NOTE> So when
hee made man, he first framed the bo|dy,
then formed the soule, Hee made
not the body and soule at one instant,
but in their times, and in order: for
when hee had made the house, he then
put in the tenant, &amp; not before. Second|ly,
is considered the excellency of the
nature of our soules.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The nature of our soules. Gen. 2. 7.</NOTE> For God neyther
made nor created our soule, but inspi|red
it by the vertue of his diuinity. <HI>Gen.
2. 7. The Lord God also made man of the
dust of the ground,</HI> there is the matter of
his body. <HI>And breathed in his face the
breath of life:</HI> there was the nature and
excellence of his soule; being the breath
of almighty God, diuine, spirituall &amp;
eternall. <HI>And the man was</HI> (then) <HI>a li|uing
soule:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The soule is the distin|guishing forme of man.</NOTE> for before God inspired the
soule, was man onely framed and not
formed, his reasonable soule being that
which doth distinguish him from all o|ther
creatures, being (in respect of his
soule) the nearest resemblance to Gods
diuinity.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 1. 26 Man is Gods i|mage in re|spect of his reasonable soule.</NOTE> For so God determining his
creation, sayth: <HI>Let vs make man in our
own image, according to our likenes.</HI> Mans
<PB N="42" REF="29">
soule, being (in respect of reason &amp; eter|nity,
a resemblance of Gods diuinity.</P>
<P>The fourth consideration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fourthly.</NOTE> is the rule
and gouernment God gaue man ouer
all creatures. <HI>Gen,</HI> 1. 26.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 1. 26.</NOTE> <HI>And let them rule
ouer the fish of the seas</HI> &amp;c. First, it is con|sidered,
that God by giuing man this
authority,<NOTE PLACE="marg">With what cautions God gaue man go|vernment.</NOTE> doth not disinable himself of
the gouernment of his owne creatures,
but doth reserue to himselfe the Soue|raigne
regality; giuing man a steward|ship,
and superintendance onely.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 24. 1</NOTE> <HI>The
earth</HI> (sayth holy <HI>Dauid) is the Lords, and
all that is therin, the round world, and they
that dwell therein.</HI> Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Secondly</NOTE> in that
it is sayd, <HI>God gaue them rule, &amp;c.</HI> there
is a double consideration. First, that
God communicateth his power to
mankind in generall, not to this or that
particular.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The gene|rall descent of power deriued vpo~ all.</NOTE> For God speaketh in the
plurall number, <HI>Hee gaue them,</HI> and not
him power, &amp;c. So that the power is
deriued vpon all, and not vpon one,
or any number of certaine particulars.
Againe, these words, hee gaue them,
haue relation to the words, he created
them. <HI>Gen.</HI> 1. 27.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 1. 27.</NOTE> <HI>God created the man in
<PB N="43" REF="29">
his image, in the image of God created hee
him, he created them male and female.</HI> So
when he gaue man the gouernment of
the world, hee sayth, <HI>He gaue them</HI> that
is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The man and woman had a like authority in Gods creatures.</NOTE> the man and the woman: for as God
did not deuide them in their Natures,
so hee would not diuide them in the vse
and gouernment of his creatures, but
whatsoeuer is lawfull to the one, is law|full
to the other; both of them hauing
equall and indifferent power in the vse
of Gods creatures.</P>
<P>Lastly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fiftly.</NOTE> is considered the end of mans
creation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The end of mans crea|tion.</NOTE> which is, that God may bee
glorified in the seruice of so noble a
creature. <HI>I say,</HI> 43. 7.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isay. 43. 7.</NOTE> <HI>I created him for my
glory, formed him and made him.</HI> God is
glorified or honoured in a double re|spect.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE>
First, in acknowledgement. Se|condly,
in personall seruice. In acknow|ledgements,
when men haue a thanke|full
remembrance of Gods mercy in
the creation, and in the Redemption of
mankind. This acknowledgement is
declared in the meditations, prayers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How we should de|clare our thanks to God.</NOTE>
thankesgiuings, and reuerence of
holy men, to the Name, the Me|mory,
<PB N="44" REF="30">
and the maiesty of God. In the
15. of <HI>Exodus,</HI> the second verse, <HI>Moses</HI>
acknowledging Gods mercy in theyr
deliuerance sayth:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 15. 2.</NOTE> <HI>The Lord is my stre~gth
and prayse, and hee is become my saluation:
he is my God, and I will prepare him a ta|bernacle:
hee is my Fathers God, and I will
exalt</HI> (or honor) <HI>him.</HI> And the Prophet
<HI>Dauid</HI> hath it common in his holy me|ditations,
that he will honour God in
his acknowledgements; and condem|neth
the hypocrisie of euill men, that
honour God with their lips, and haue
their hearts farre from him. And Saint
<HI>Paul</HI> in the heate of his zealous affecti|on,
calleth this glory his reioycing, and
disclameth euery other obiect of glo|ry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 6. 14.</NOTE>
but Iesus Christ, and him crucified.
Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Secondly.</NOTE> God is honoured in the per|sonall
seruices of men, and that is when
they carefully trauell in the exercise of
such Christian duties, as he hath com|manded.<NOTE PLACE="marg">How wee should glo|rifie God in personall seruice.</NOTE>
This hath relation to that
conditionall proposition of our Sa|uiour
Christ: <HI>If you loue mee keepe my
commandements.</HI> For if we neyther keep
nor endeuour to keepe his commande|ments,
<PB N="45" REF="30">
we loue not; and whom we loue
not, we cannot honour. And as Christ
sayth of himselfe. The works which I
doe, be are witnesse of mee, &amp;c. So the
endeuours of our liues,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ouractions witnesse our affections.</NOTE> witnesse what
we are, and whether wee honour God,
and loue him or not. These fiue parti|culars,
are the maine considerations to
be regarded in the creating of man. In
the creator is remembred his delibera|tion,
<HI>Let vs:</HI> in the Creation, the mat|ter

rule, his end: his rule, he was <HI>Steward,</HI>
and superintendent Lord ouer all: his
end, the glory and seruice of his creator
God.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<HEAD>The generall Vse.</HEAD>
<P>The generall vse of this doctrine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vse</NOTE> is a
general acknowledgement of duty that
all men owe to God their creator,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Man made noble out of basenesse.</NOTE> who

to giue him such rule, to ordayne
him such an end, equall to the honour
of Angels,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> equall to their happinesse
This may remember all men what
God had done for them, what God
doth expect from them. It may re|member
all, what they were, what
they are, what they shall be, what they
should be. This knowledge may both
remember and admonish; it will also
preuaile in all their hearts that haue the
least mouings of Gods holie Spirite in
them. For he that knoweth this, con|sidereth
it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The repro|bate onely are carelesse in the state of their sal|uation.</NOTE> and is not mooued, doth
declare against himselfe, and doth
iudge himselfe to bee reprobate, who
fayling in the purpose of a Chri|stian
life, doth not only disinherit him|selfe
of Gods gift, which is earth, but of
Heauen, which hee would giue; and
doth by that act of disobedience, both
depriue himselfe of Gods fauor (which
is happinesse) and purchase to himselfe
a state of damnation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What hee gaineth that leeseth Gods fauor.</NOTE> infinite in time,
infinite in torment. Secondly, seeing
man was made ofso base a matter, of
<PB N="47" REF="31">
the dust of the ground,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The dis|grace of ambitious and aspiring spirits.</NOTE> the basest part
of the basest element, it doth disgrace
the pride and ambitious spirits of men,
who vaunt themselues in the noblenesse
of their descent, or in the prosperity of
their fortunes. For God hath giuen
one and the same beginning to all
men; the honourable and the base, the
rich and the poore, beeing all deriued
from one first matter, a matter so base,
as nothing could be more, being the re|fuse
&amp; of-scourings of the earth, which
all of vs were in our first matter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 3. 19.</NOTE> before
our creation; which all of vs shall be in
our graues, where we shal al be reduced
and brought backe to our first matter.
This being considered, how vaine a
folly is it for men to proud themselues
in their prosperities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pride the vainest folly in mans na|ture.</NOTE> and disgracefully
to repute men for their difference of
fortune? for the best man is but base
earth, and the basest man is created in
Gods image; all of one nature, and in
one office, and all to one end orday|ned.
Therefore in a Christian indge|ment,
there is no difference of men,
but the difference of good &amp; bad. And
<PB N="48" REF="32">
this inequality is not in their nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What the true diffe|rence of men is.</NOTE> but
in the corruption and defect of nature.
And the fasest way to esteeme men, is
to compare them in their gifts of grace,
and not of fortune. For (with God)
the least spirit of grace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The diffe|rence of grace and fortune.</NOTE> though in the

it is doubted whether Predestination

his will is eyther secret or reuealed:
his reuealed Will is the Scripture, his
<PB N="72" REF="44">

that euer were: are or shall bee. This
will is againe distinguished: for in

there is also his consent: God doth
personally in his owne Nature decree
all goodnesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gods con|sent.</NOTE> as his owne act. God
dooth also consent, and suffer that e|uill
bee done: but hee himselfe is not
the doer: yet can hee glorifie him|selfe
in the sufferance of euill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">God can receiue ho|nour from mens euill action.</NOTE> and
make it worke the purpose of his ho|ly
will. To apply this Doctrine to our
purpose, before GOD created man,
he had decreede euery circumstance,
both in his Nature and Life: hee also
did foresee the fal of man, and was con|tent
(for the secret worke of his glory)
it should bee so. So that whatsoeuer
was good in man, was in Gods decree
as his act: whatsoeuer was not good,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How to vn|derstand Gods de|cree.</NOTE>

<HEAD>Of the Morall Law of God,
the ten Commande|ments.
Chap. 7.</HEAD>
<P>_THe law of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The morall law of God and the law of nature is all one.</NOTE> though
it was not giuen to man
with solemne promul|gation,
before the time
of <HI>Moses,</HI> yet was there a
<PB N="83" REF="49">
generall sense thereof giuen to <HI>Adam</HI> in
his creation. For when God gaue him
his nature, &amp; endued him with the vse
of reason &amp; discourse, hee gaue him ca|pacity
to vndersta~d his duty, the which
duty is nothing else but the obseruatio~
of the law of God. And therefore when
<HI>Adam</HI> had transgressed the commande|ment
of God, and eaten the forbidden
fruite;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conscience can preach the law to them that know it not.</NOTE> the reason of his naturall soule
could tell him his offence; and then his
conscience iudging him, he was afraid,
and hid himselfe from Gods presence.
If we compare his sinne with the com|mandements
of the Law, wee shall find
it to be a direct breach of som, &amp; a con|sequent
breach of all. Gods first com|mandement
saith:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 20. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE> <HI>Thou shalt haue none
other Gods but mee: Adams</HI> sinne doth
contradict Gods commandement, and
sayth: nay, but my wife and I will both
be Gods for with this perswasion the
Diuell tempted them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 3. 1.</NOTE> and they did
eate. Againe, <HI>Cain</HI> the second man, he
committed murther,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 4. 13.</NOTE> and thereby di|rectly
broke the sixt commandement:
which when God and his conscience
<PB N="84" REF="50">
made him to vnderstand, hee made a
desperate acknowledgement of his sin.
So that the law being nothing but a
reasonable duetie, which the Creature
oweth to his Creator: there was ther|fore
a generall knowledge of this law
in the reasonable nature of man at his
creation, and so in the succession of
them of the old world, vnto the time
<HI>that the Law was giuen to Moses by the
ordinance of angels.</HI> The old world (the~)
from <HI>Adam</HI> to <HI>Moses,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 3. 19.</NOTE> were not lawlesse
&amp; free from the seruice of law; but had
the law of nature for their direction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The law of nature, the same with the law of the x. com|mandeme~ts.</NOTE>
which being grounded vpon reason.
was euen the very same with the law of
the x. co~mandements. The law then of
the x. comma~dements before it was gi|ue~
to <HI>Moses,</HI> was in the ages before go|ing
commonly transgressed, and that
law did both iudge &amp; condemne them:
the which law God gaue man when he
gaue him his nature, euery man hauing
the knowledge of this law in the natu|rall
vse of his reason. This was the state
of the old world before <HI>Moses,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The state of the olde world.</NOTE> all sin|ned,
and all were iudged by the law of
<PB N="85" REF="50">
nature, the morall law, euen before the
promulgation thereof in mount <HI>Sina,</HI>
condemning the transgressions of men
that were directly against the seuerall
commandements.</P>
<P>Now when iniquity beganne to be
strong in the hearts of men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The pro|mulgation of the law.</NOTE> and that
their consciences became senselesse of
sin, neyther would admonish, &amp; iudge
their transgressions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasons why.</NOTE> then God thought
conuenie~t to publish to al mankind this
law, binding the consciences of men to
a dutifull obseruation of euery particu|lar
statute in that law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 23, 10.</NOTE> denouncing the
iudgment of condemnation to al them
that transgresse against the least branch<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baruch. 4. 1.</NOTE>
or particle of those commandements.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Reasons.</NOTE></P>
<P>A second reason why God ordayned
the law, was that men might rightly
vnderstand themselues, &amp; therby know
in what degree of holines they were, be|cause
that men are often partial in their
own iudgment, &amp; willingly blind them
selus in the view of their own calamity.
<HI>Wherfore then serueth the law?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 3. 19.</NOTE> <HI>it was ad|ded
because of the tra~sgressio~s,</HI> that by the
law men may know wherein they haue
transgressed.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="51">A third reason of the ordination of
the law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3. Reason.</NOTE> is to prouoke men to indeuor
themselues with all diligence to trauell
in godly exercise, &amp; to auoid both euil
action and idlenes; the lawes giuing e|uery
man sufficient matter of imploy|ment,
wherin he is bou~d to suspend his
houres, his dayes, nay his life in carefull
sernice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Esd 9. 31.</NOTE> 2. <HI>Esd. 9, 31. For behold I sow my
law in you, that it may bring forth fruit in
you, &amp; that ye may be honored by it for euer</HI></P>
<P>A fourth reason of the Law, is, that
by the seuerity thereof, wee might bee
disciplined, and made fitte for the mer|cy
of the Gospell;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The vse of the law.</NOTE> for the iudgement of
the law will humble vs, make vs vnder|stand
our misery, and prouoke vs to

was our schoolmaster to bring vs to Christ
that we might be made righteous by faith.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4. Reason.</NOTE> the law was giuen for the glo|ry
and maiesty of God, that all the
world might bee iudge of his infinite
mercy to mankind: In this respect,
<PB N="87" REF="51">
that notwithstanding, all men are
iudged, and condemned by the law of
nature, and by the law of his comman|dements:
yet in the greatnesse of his
loue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gods ad|mirable mercy.</NOTE> he is content to forgiue the tres|pas,
and the iudgements; and finally to
entertaine these transgressors his ene|mies,
into the bosome of his mercy;
giuing them mercy for iustice, and
life when they deserued death with
extremity. <HI>Rom.</HI> 5. 20.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 5. 20.</NOTE> <HI>Moreouer the
Law entered thereupen that the offence
should abound, neuerthelesse where sinne
abounded, there grace abounded much
more, Verse the 21. That as sinne had raig|ned
vnto death, so might grace also raigne
by righteousnesse vnto eternall life, through
Iesus Christ our Lord.</HI> And this is an ad|mirable
degree of loue in the person of

<P>In the law of the ten commaunde|ments,
is to be considered the substance
which is the matter of the law; and the

deliuering it. The matter is contained

the sixe latter our duties to men. This
learning of the commandements, how
to vnderstand, and how to diuide them.
is in the knowledge of euery Childe of
carefull education, it being commonly
taught at the catechizing of Christian
children. I shall therefore spare the
large trauel this Argument requireth,
and refer the desirous Reader to the
learned expositions of other men. In
the manner of giuing the Law, we may
principally consider these circumstan|ces.
<MILESTONE N="1"> First, the principall giuer of the
<MILESTONE N="2"> law, God. Secondly, the seruants atten|ding
this office, the Angels. Thirdly
<MILESTONE N="3"> to whom it was giuen, <HI>Moses.</HI> Fourth|ly,

then the people of God; and by conse|quence
<PB N="89" REF="52">
to euery people that professe
themselues his seruants. These are the
maine particulars in the circumstance
of giuing the law. First, God hee was
the principall author of this worke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 God the giuer of the Law.</NOTE> to
giue it countenance and authority: for
who dare quarrell his Worke, and the
operation of his hands? Therefore did
God himselfe speake all the wordes of
the commandements; hee also spoke in
a terrible and fearefull manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 20. 1.</NOTE> to gaine
the businesse reuerence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 19. 19</NOTE> and a fearefull
estimation he spoke in the hearing of
the people, that they might know it
vvas Gods owne act:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 19. 9.</NOTE> and to preuent
the distrust they might haue of his ser|uant
<HI>Moses.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Secondly, The angels attend at the giuing of the law.</NOTE> Secondly, the Angells
they attend this holy seruice, to de|clare
the most excellent Maiesty of
God, who in all his occasions is ser|ued
and attended by an infinite num|ber
of that excellent Nature. Againe,
the Angells were there, because they
are most desirous of the good of
mankinde:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 1. 14.</NOTE> and doe willingly attend
the seruice of our saluation: <HI>Ha|uing
ioy amongst themselues in heauen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 15. 7. 10.</NOTE>
<PB N="90" REF="53">
<HI>at the conuersion of a sinner.</HI> They were
there also to bee witnesses betweene
God &amp; his people, that the couenants
might remayne established for euer.
And therefore sayeth Saint <HI>Paul,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 3. 19.</NOTE> <HI>The
law was ordained by Angels in the hand of
a Mediator:</HI> not that the Angells did
principally giue the Law, and appoint
the couenant, but that the seruice was
onely attended by their holy Ministra|tion.
Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thirdly, The law was giuen by MOSES.</NOTE> the Law was giuen by
<HI>Moses;</HI> that is, God gaue it <HI>Moses</HI> to
giue the <HI>Israelites,</HI> because the spirite of
God had so sanctified <HI>Moses,</HI> that hee
was able to stand in the prese~ce of God:
the which the host of the <HI>Israelits</HI> could
not do, but became astonished, and ex|ceedingly
afraid at the voyce of Gods
thunders. And therefore they desired
<HI>Moses</HI> that hee would negotiate for
them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 20. 19</NOTE> betwixt God and them, they be|ing
not able to endure the presence of
his Maiesty. Againe, it was giuen by
<HI>Moses,</HI> because God would honor him
aboue the rest of his brethren:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> he ha|uing
been most industrious &amp; constant
in the seruice of God. And therefore as
<PB N="91" REF="53">
God had giuen them deliuerance out
of Aegypt, by the hand of <HI>Moses,</HI> so
would hee giue them by the hand of
<HI>Moses</HI> the couenants of his euerlasting
loue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The pro|mises of the law are now gained by the Gospell.</NOTE> and deliuerance from the bondage
of sinne: all which grace was promised
vnto them that would liue within the
compasse of these lawes, and is now gi|uen
to them that faithfully endeuour,
though they fayle in the maine perfor|mance:
<HI>For the Law was giuen by Moses,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 1. 17.</NOTE>
<HI>but grace and Truth came by Iesus Christ.
Iohn.</HI> 1. 7. Lastly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fourthly, The Law was giuen Israel.</NOTE> the Law was giuen (by
name to the Israelites; but in the pur|pose
of God to all men, all men beeing
vnder the bondage of the Morall law of
God, and the Law being able to iudge
and condemne all men. It was (by
name) giuen to the Israelites, because
then they were the choyce and select
people of God; for whome hee had
done his wonders, and to whome hee
had promised a faire inheritance. It is
also deriued downe vpon vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Law was deriued downe on vs, &amp; not to the Iewes onely.</NOTE> and vpon
all posterity, all men hauing entred co|uenant
with God, to endeuour them|selues,
in the faithfull keeping of the
<PB N="92" REF="54">
commandements of the law. All these
circumstances, are necessarily conside|red
in the manner of Gods deliuering
the law. From this may bee generally
obserued,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Obseruati|ons in the Law.</NOTE> that God in all his actions
hath principall respect to holinesse, and
that no prophane circumstances assist
him in his actions, but as himselfe is
most holy, so his delight is in holy ac|tions,
and hateth al prophanation both
of matter and circumstance. In the
law may be generally obserued,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 An im|possibility in the strict performa~ce.</NOTE> first
an impossibility in the precise perfor|mance
thereof, no man beeing able
(without fauour) to make an euen rec|koning
with the Law: the Law being
able to conclude vs all vnder sinne. It
is an Argument of Saint <HI>Peter, Acts.</HI> 15.

The manner of this iudgement

<P>Now that which hath most busie

the conscience, by which the soule hath
true vnderstanding in what condition
it is; and by whose authority the iudge|ment
of that spirituall Court is swayed:
the conscience giuing testimony of all
our actions, good and euill, whereby
our iudging part is directed (without

all partiality. And therefore saith
the Wise-man. <HI>Blessed is he that is not

therefore the Scribes &amp; Pharisees that

to Christ, and demaunded what iudge|ment

it is a wonderfull degree of power the

<PB N="108" REF="63">
spareth no man, neyther any sinne, but

sayth Saint <HI>Paul:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 2. 15.</NOTE> <HI>Their conscience bea|ring

Almighty God when hee shall gather

hath deuised (in his wisedome,) that
euery one shall haue a witnesse in him|selfe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our con|sciences shal reproue vs in the day of iudge|ment.</NOTE>
(which is his conscience,) the
which in our life time doth register
both our good and euill actions, and
at our iudgement doth witnesse &amp; de|clare
them. And therefore the Holy
Ghost calleth the conscience a Booke,
euery man and woman hauing one,
wherin is writ a true story of euery cir|cumstance,
of euery particular action,
of euery mans life. And these bookes,

Thus wee see what the office of

that conscience vseth in this mini|stration

and to vnderstand this, we must remem+ber

men generally haue a conscience, the
which GOD hath vnited inseparably
to our reasonable Natures. And ther|fore
not only they that are of christian
beleefe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All men endure or shall endure the griefe of conscience.</NOTE> and haue the rules of religion

suffer the affliction of their offen|ded

a farre inferiour degree to that of vn|derstanding
Christians; yet doth it (in
some proportion) exercise a iudgment
on the soule, and doth both remember
and terrifie them that grosly offend a|gainst
the law of nature; which to them
is the law of reason and religion. This
is proued by that place of Scripture I
before alledged:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reu. 20. 12.</NOTE> That the Bookes of
all the dead were opened; the word
(all) excluding none from the accusa|tion

remembers all men, all sinne, without

this difference also; that of Infidels and

calamity of the Soule; and Spirit, to re|proue
and admonish it in needfull di|rections.
And this grace of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How God moueth the conscience.</NOTE> giuing
the conscience sence to vnderstand sin,
and Spirit to reproue it; is the first de|gree
of our reformation, and the pre|paration
to our spirituall conuersion:
GOD himselfe beeing the prime and
principall Author thereof. This begin|ning
of the grace of God spreads it self
<PB N="115" REF="66">
into very large proceedings;<NOTE PLACE="marg">When God doth stirre our consci|ence, it con|tinueth that holy moti|on to our reforma|tion.</NOTE> for when
our conscience is once touched with
this godly desire to examine the er|rours
of our life, God doth not there
leaue vs, but giueth vs a continuall as|sistance,
to finish that needefull care,
without despayre; without fainting.
The manner may bee thus considered.
The conscience (beeing instructed by
grace) vnderstandeth that the soule is
in danger of Gods iudgement: this
knowledge causeth a desire in the soule
to examine the particulars of our life:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The man|ner how a good con|science worketh.</NOTE>
then doth it compare our seuerall ac|tions,
with the seuerall duties of the
law, and thereby is made euident the
many and great defects of our life, and
that therfore our soules and bodies are
guilty, and stand in the danger of con|demnation.
From this knowledge
dooth arise the griefe of a wounded
conscience:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cause of the griefe of consci|ence.</NOTE> for the Statute lawes of
God condemning vs for the trespasse
of our liues; the conscience then (whose
office is to accuse, or excuse) vp|braideth
our sinne, and denounceth the
iudgement of the law against vs, which
<PB N="116" REF="67">
is eternall damnation. And in this
case wee may compare our soules to
fellons at the Barre, who hauing
pleaded guilty, and receyued the sen|tence
of the Lawe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> abandon all hope,
and onely prepare themselues for the
stroke of execution: yet the soueraigne
Iudge, being pleased to descend mer|cy
to these poore condemned Priso|ners,
offers them the benefite of their
Clergie, promising mercy to all them
that shall bee able to reade the lines
proposed them. So our soules bee|ing
arrested for sinne, and standing
at the barre of our owne iudgement,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The guilty soule like a condemned fellon.</NOTE>
beeing accused by conscience, and
hauing the Law against vs, to con|demne
vs; wee are then in a much
more grieuous condemnation then
fellons, because they feare but a
temporall death, but we eternall. Nei|ther
can wee (more then they) free
our soules from these extremities,
vntill GOD (who is the Iudge of all
the world) shall please to offer mer|cy,
and the benefite of his Clergie;
which is nothing else but the storie

Chap. 1.</HEAD>
<P>_THE story of the Bible,
from the first beginning
to the birth of our Saui|our
Iesus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gos|pell.</NOTE> doth for the
most part declare the
miserable condition of mankind, how
he hath faln from the innocency of his
nature, which God gaue him in his first
creation; and how he hath continued in
sinne, and in the curse of God for sin:
hauing no power in himselfe to satisfie
the iustice of GOD, or to reconcile
him selfe to his fauour. Therefore did
God giue the law of the ten comman|dements
(the particulars of his reuea|led
<PB N="132" REF="75">
will.<NOTE PLACE="marg">How to vse and apply the Scrip|tures.</NOTE>) both to prouoke men to en|deuour
in the exercise of all godli|nesse,
and also that by the knowledge
of the Law, men might know theyr
owne defectes, and by their humilia|tion
to bee prepared, and made fitt for
the mercy of the Gospell. For though
Iesus Christ the substance of the Gos|pell,
was (in the counsell of GOD
from all beginnings) determined to
be the Redeemer of mankinde, being
also promised to our first Parents,
and by whome all the faithfull before
his incarnation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The faith|full, before the incarna|tion of Christ, were saued by Christ. The diffe|rence be|tweene the Law and Gospell.</NOTE> had the pardon of
theyr sinnes, apprehending (by faith)
the promise of his righteousnesse:
yet was not this grace declared them
in such plaine and direct euidence, as
now it is in the preaching of the
Gospell: it being then deliuered one|ly
in shadowes, Ceremonies, pro|phecies,
and in the mysticall sense
of Allegories, so that few had capa|city
and grace (rightly) to vnder|stand
them. All which difficulties
are now vanished in the preaching
of the Gospell, the Gospell presen|ting
<PB N="133" REF="75">
vs (in most familiar and easie de|monstrations)
the substance without
the shadow, and the truth without
the figure, withall giuing directions
and infallible rules, not onely to know
the means of our saluation; but how to
make it ours, to apprehend and apply
it to our owne particular comfort. And
this grace doth the Gospell giue with
such fauour, as that the necessary do|ctrines
exceed not the vnderstandings
of men of meanest capacities; but that
all that will (without respect or excep|tion)
may reach their hands of faith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great fauour and liberty of the Gospell.</NOTE>
to the Crosse of Christ, and freelie
apprehend the meanes of their sal|uation,
which is the Lord Iesus, tri|umphing
at the Conquest of his
death, ouer sinne, hell, and damna|tion.</P>
<P>This is a blessed alteration in the state
of the world:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A happy al+teration.</NOTE> for in the time of the law,
when the grace of the Gospell was hid
in the clouds of the ceremonies, the ob+seruers
of the ceremoniall law, did sel|dome
vnderstand the mysticall sense of
the ceremony, which did allude to som
<PB N="134" REF="76">
particular grace in the Gospell.)<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cere|monies of the law did allude to the graces of the Gos|pell.</NOTE> And
therefore though God was pleased to
accept their carefull endeuour in their
religious obseruing the ceremonie,
which was but a figure of the truth in|cluded
in the ceremony; yet they wan|ted
a great part of that spirituall com|fort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tit. 2. 11.</NOTE>
which wee haue in obseruing
the couenant of grace (the Gospell)
the grace of God appearing to them
as God himselfe did to the Israelites
their Fathers at the deliuering of the
law in cloudes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 19. 16.</NOTE> in fire, in smoake and
thunders: but to vs hee dooth ap|peare
more familiarly, Iesus Christ his
Sonne, and the most liuely represent|ment
of himselfe, assuming our nature,
and conuersing with vs, did wound our
sinne, and heale the woundes sinne had
made in our soules; in whom God was
(personally) present, whose wordes
taught saluation, and whose actions
wrought it. This is the difference be|twixt
the law &amp; the Gospell. The Law
commandeth vs to doe and liue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What the law com|mandeth. What the Gospel.</NOTE> if not,
to dye; the Gospell (all mercy) requi|reth
to beleeue onely, and line: and
<PB N="135" REF="76">
this is a wonderfull degree of Gods
fauour, that because wee are not able
to keepe the couenants of his law, is
therefore pleased to yeeld to our infir|mities,
to alter our obligation, and
to enter new couenants with vs:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The coue|nant of Grace.</NOTE> the
couenant of Grace, whereby God doth
indent with man, and bindes the iustice
of his law in the bonds of his mercy,
promising saluation to all them that
faithfully beleeue in the merites and
mediation of his Sonne Christ. Thus
doth God allure vs by easie meane, &amp;
fayre promises to inherite euerlasting
life, which the law denyeth to all men:
no man being able to satisfie the iustice
of the law. If it be obiected then,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Obiection.</NOTE> that
the grace of the Gospell doth destroy
the workes of the law, because that
mercy is giuen of grace, and not of de|serts,
I answere,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Answere.</NOTE> that the Gospel doth
not destroy the substance of the Law,
but doth onely abate and mitigate the
rigor thereof: as God when he preser|ued
<HI>Daniel</HI> in the Lyons denne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. 6. 16.</NOTE> did not
destroy the Lyons, but onely shut their
mouthes, and bound theyr power, that
<PB N="136" REF="77">
they might not hurt <HI>Daniel:</HI> So hee
hath not destroyed the law, but dooth
onely restraine the violence thereof
from hurting his <HI>Daniels,</HI> that is, the
faithfull.</P>
<P>And as when <HI>Darius</HI> tooke <HI>Daniell</HI>
from the denne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. 6. 24</NOTE> and cast in his accu|sers,
the Lyons then had the maistry,
and deuoured them; so the reprobate
shall not auoyde the condemation
of the Law, notwithstanding the pro|mise
of the Gospell, and the new coue|nants
of grace; because no man hath the
benefite of mercy, but hee that (first)
is the childe of faith.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The diffe|rence of re|spect GOD hath to his seruants, and to his slaues.</NOTE> And therefore
the great King of all the World shall
take his faithfull <HI>Daniels</HI> from the po|wer
of the Lyons (the law,) but leaue
the reprobate in the state of theyr
destruction. Thus much in generall
of the Gospell, and of the generall
difference betweene that and the law,
and betweene them that liued vnder
the bondage of the law, and vs that
liue now in the Liberty of the Gos|pell.</P>
<P>The purpose of the Gospell is the
<PB N="137" REF="77">
saluation of men. And therefore the
Angel that was the first preacher of the
Gospell, tolde the Sheepheards that
<HI>hee brought them tidings of great ioy:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 2. 10.</NOTE> (in|deed)
a greater could not bee then to
bring them the newes of their saluati|on.
The matter of the Gospell is the
life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 15. 1. 2. 3.</NOTE> the death, &amp; the doctrines of Iesus
Christ; for they are the only meanes by
which wee attaine to the fauour of sal|uation:
his doctrines were directions,
his life examples, and his death was, &amp;
is life to all that apprehend him, In the
circumstance of the Gospell is princi|pally
considered; First God, who of
himselfe &amp; of his owne election,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cir|cumstance of the Gos|pell.</NOTE> with|out
cause in man, did enter this coue|nant
of grace, being moued only by the
pleasure of his owne will, and by his
own gracious loue to his creatures. For
so saith the holy Ghost:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 3. 16.</NOTE> <HI>God so loued the
world that hee gaue his onely begotten son,
that whosoeuer beleeued in him should not
perish,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The loue of God, the mouing cause of the couenant of grace.</NOTE> <HI>but haue euerlasting life.</HI> Whereby
it is euident that the loue of God was
the onely cause that moued him to this
effect: for God ca~ glorifie himself aswel
<PB N="138" REF="78">
in the damnation, as in the saluation of
men: for hee needeth no addition of
honour, that is infinite both in great|nesse
and goodnesse; but as his mercy
is most eminent ouer all his attributes,
so in this new Couenant of the Gospell
hee doth giue vs the greatest demon|stration
of his mercy that can be, in gi|uing
his onely begotten Son to dye on
the crosse for the redemption of man|kind:
in euery word whereof there is an
emphasis or a passion of loue (infinite|ly)
beyond al comparison:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Secondly.</NOTE> where it see|meth
that God doth (as it were,) put
off his Maiesty, and descend himselfe in
his care to pitty, and redresse the rui|ned
state of sinfull man his enemy. Se|condly,
in the person of Christ (who is
the cause both mouing &amp; finishing the
couenant of the Gospell) there is mat|ter
of most worthy and admirable con|sideration.
For Christ is not onely to
bee vnderstood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How to vn|derstand Christ in the Gospell.</NOTE> as the instrumentall
cause, whereby this couenant of grace
betweene God and man was effected,
but also as the first mouing cause and
deuiser of it, it being impossible to as|signe
<PB N="139" REF="78">
him offices without his owne ap|pointment,
he being equall to God the
Father, and the holy Ghost: and they
all hauing but one diuinity vndiuided.
This the vnbeleeuing Iewes could not
comprehend, and therefore they deri|ded
Christ when he said:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 8. 5. 8.</NOTE> <HI>Before Abra|bam
was, I am,</HI> not knowing that he was
God equall and coeternall with his Fa|ther,
and was begotten before all begin|nings.</P>
<P>It is therefore most wonderfull in
the person of Christ, that hee being
God, and the Lord of all the World:
that he would leaue the bosome of his
Father,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strong wit|nesses of the loue of Christ.</NOTE> and (for a time) to put off the
presence of his diuine Maiesty, and to
take our nature vpon him in humilitie,
and in a base estate, and to vndertake
(not onely) to satisfie the law, &amp; make
good our defects, but also to beare the
displeasure of his father, and to suffer
the malice of wicked men to preuayle,
euen to his death, and that he hath en|dured
all this for the good of man, a
creature that by sin had brought him|selfe
in disgrace with God. And which
<PB N="140" REF="79">
is most of all; that hee hath done al this
by his owne appointment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ suffe|red of his owne will, and not by constraint.</NOTE> without ey|ther
commaund or direction, there be|ing
no power aboue him, by whom he
could be commanded. This incompa|rable
loue is able to astonish a Christi|an
meditation, and to make it admire
&amp; say with holy <HI>Dauid: Lord what is ma~
that thou hast such respect vnto him, or the
sonne of man; that thou so regardest him?

grace is given. The first officers (in this
kind) were the twelue Apostles, of pur|pose
chosen by the Lord Iesus himselfe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Apostles.</NOTE>
that they might be the faithfull witnes|ses
of the whole passage of his life,

vpon the foundation of the rocke
Christ, they haue erected such a frame
as shall remayne to all posteritie.
These holy Ministers were the con|ducts,
whereby God did conferre his
spirituall waters of life into all the parts
of the world, who spreading themselus
(in their painefull trauell) ouer all the
knowne world, spread the Gospell as
they went; &amp; left in euery place where
they came, a memory of their Lord and
maister Christ Iesus. After the~ succee|ded
others in their example, who both
taught the gospell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The state of the primi|tiue Church</NOTE> &amp; confirmed it with
the testimony of their death. These are
the holy officers in the ministration of
the gospell, &amp; all that liue in the church
of God in their office, &amp; in their exam|ple,
shal with them receiue the wages of
faithfulnes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A question in much controuersy</NOTE> Here is offered a large occa|sion
to dispute a questio~ in co~trouersie,
<PB N="142" REF="80">
who are they that are the true Mini|sters
of the Gospell.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Papist.</NOTE> The Church of
Rome challenge to be onely able to de|riue
a true ministery, because (say they)
they haue continued one and the same
succession from the Apostles downe|wardes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pro|testants o|pinion.</NOTE>
The Protestants misproue their
Ministery, and plead intrusion of cere|monie,
and corruption of errour, and
professe to haue reduced a Ministe|ry
in most neare proportion to that of
the Primitiue Church. The Brownist
is peremptory against them both, and
fondly pleads against the names and ti|tles
of the ministery.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Puri|tane and Brownist.</NOTE> And therefore as
these quarrels are vnplacable and out
of hope to be reconciled, I wil leaue the~
in their strife, with this admonition to
my reader: That we despise not Christ,
because vpon his Crosse hee did hang
with theeues; neyther that wee honour
theeus, because they hang with Christ:
for that which is but neare truth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Truth be|tween two extremities of errour. Fourthly.</NOTE> is no
truth, and the best vertue is placed be|tweene
two extremities.</P>
<P>Lastly, is to be considered, to whom
the benefites of the Gospel appertaine;
<PB N="143" REF="80">
and that is to the elect, namely such
as are most industrious in the faithfull
execution of the law; for as I haue sayd
God hath not giuen the Gospell to
destroy the Law, but to preserue and re|uiue
it, that men may be allured by the
sweet promises of the Gospell to ende|uour
with alacritie and hope in the ex|ercise
of the law. And therefore Christ
himselfe sayth: <HI>If yee loue mee, keepe my
commandements:</HI> that is, endeuour to
keepe them with all diligence: for he
that is carelesse in the seruice of God,
is not to hope that God will bee care|full
of his saluation. This is also ap|proued
in the parable of the Labourers
in the Vineyard.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 21. 1. &amp;c.</NOTE> The Mayster of the
Vineyard is God, the Vineyard is the
world, the Labourers are the faithfull
and painefull Christians, their wages is
the benefite of the Gospell. So that not
the lookers on, but the Labourers in
Gods Vineyard shall receyue the wa|ges
of euerlasting saluation.</P>
<P>These considerations are most weigh|ty
in the generall vnderstanding of the
Gospell, to which I will adde this ad|monition:
<PB N="144" REF="81">
That all men esteeme wor|thilie
and reuerently of the Gospell of
Iesus Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s. 2. 10. 11. 12.</NOTE> because God doth iudge
the contemners thereof to be guilty of
deserued damnation. And that if God
present them the meanes to communi|cate
with the benefites of the Gospell,
that they neglect (rather) all the pro|fites
in the world, then the treasure of
the Gospell. For that is that one thing
which is only necessary, and that pearle

it was also in the fulnesse of

issue this foundation of Christian reli|gion,
that the Couenant of grace was

did execute his diuine office with a

to his death on the crosse, in all

Thus is Christ generally to bee vnder|stood,
as hee was the principall matter
of the Gospell, and the onely working
meanes of our saluation. To make this
doctrine familiar and profitable to
Christian men of easie vnderstanding
I will subdiuide this double care of
Christ into particulars. The wordes
of Christ, the time of his Incarnation
<PB N="159" REF="88">
did instruct vs the duties of our soule,
and the duties of society; the duties of
the soule,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The duties of the soule</NOTE> are all those thinges that are
needfully required in the state of Chri|stianity,
whether we respect the neces|sary
faith of the Church, the necessary
orders in the Church; or the necessary
obedience to the Church. The duetie
of society is ciuill action,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The duty of society.</NOTE> and humani|ty;
that is&punc; a louing, charitable and or|derly
conuersing of Christian men.
And this Christ Iesus hath called the
great commandement; great indeede,
and of great consequence, because
without this duty of humanity, wee can
not performe our duty of diuinity: for
hee that first loueth not his neighbour
whom he hath seene, cannot loue God
whom hee hath not seene. And these
duties of the soule, and society, com|prehend
generally the substance of such
doctrines as Christ Iesus himselfe hath
deliuered. The workes of Christ are
also of the matter of the Gospell, and
comprehend such thinges as were ne|cessary
to be done by Christ, and ne|cessary
to be knowne and beleeued of
<PB N="160" REF="89">
vs being the price of our redemption,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Necessary in respect of his own de|cree.</NOTE>
without which it was impossible wee
should be reconciled to Gods fauours,
and by which the couenant of the gos|pell
is both obtained, and confirmed
vnto vs. All which workes of Christ I
reduce to these three principals; to his
birth,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><LIST>
<ITEM>1. The birth.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The life.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The death of Christ.</ITEM>
</LIST></NOTE> to his life, and to his death: what
he did by assuming our nature, what he
did &amp; suffered by liuing in our nature,
and what he did by suffering, when hee
dyed in our nature.<NOTE PLACE="marg">What hee did in being borne.</NOTE> And this (I take) to
bee the most orderly vnderstanding of
the Workes of our Sauiour Christ.
When Christ did assume our nature,
&amp; was borne of the blessed Virgine, he
did an act of great loue, and of great hu|mility:
of great humility, in that hee
daigned to descend his Maiesty, and to
take our nature vnto his Diuinity,
whereby hee became subiect to a tem|porall
death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 2. 9.</NOTE> and in (that respect) <HI>A
little inferiour to the Angels,</HI> his owne
creatures.</P>
<P>Secondly, it was an act of wonder|full
goodnesse, because the end thereof
had not respect to any meanes that
<PB N="161" REF="89">
might enlarge the honour and felicitie
of Christ himselfe, in whome there is
(naturally) an infinite measure of all
happinesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The respect</NOTE> but had respect onely to
poore and sinnefull man, that by this
meanes hee might repossesse the fauor
of God, from which hee had cast him|selfe
by his owne disobedience.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Obiection.</NOTE> Now it
may be demanded, that seeing the na|ture
of man is so poysoned with heredi|tary
sin, as that all the descents of man|kind
haue a naturall corruption deriued
on them, the which like a generall lepro|sie
deformes the ancient beauty of our

the maiesty of God: how the~ could
Christ take such a nature, so deformed,
without imputation of sin, and without
fowling the exact holines and sincerity
of his diuine nature.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Answere. Christ took our nature but not the corruption of nature.</NOTE> I answere that
Christ tooke our nature, nay all our na|ture;
yet not those staines, nor that cor|ruption
wherwith sin had deformed our

yet is it not of the essence of our
nature, but a defect or an accidental de|formity
which happened to our nature
<PB N="162" REF="90">
not when God first gaue our nature,
but after it was giuen. And all those
staines and deformities which natural|ly
are bred in vs in the wombe, and at
our conception, were all voyded and
absent at the Incarnation of our bles|sed
Sauiour: the holy Ghost sanctifi|ing
and preparing the sacred Virgin,
ordayned for that holy office, where|by
shee was onely made able to deriue
her nature with her issue, immaculate,
without sinne, without corruption (but
not without infirmity.) And this sa|cred
deriuing of a sanctified nature
from the blessed Virgine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The blessed virgin.</NOTE> is not to bee
considered, as the act or power of the
holy Virgin, but of the holy Ghost; who
being God, coequal with the Father &amp;
the son, was able to separate our nature
from corruption, &amp; so to sanctifie the

giue satisfaction, wherein is registred
not all his life, but so much as the wis|dome

it is euident that Christ had a double

<HEAD>Of Repentance, the sorrow
of the Soule for
sinne.
Chap. 3.</HEAD>
<P>_WHen Christian men
haue vnderstanding by
the Law of God, of
their miserable estate
(in respect of sinne)
what they were in in|nocency,
what they are in sin, &amp; what
they shall be in iudgement, it bringeth
a general sadnesse on the soules of men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Repentance</NOTE>
and dulleth the spirite and delight they
haue had in their prosperous fortunes:<NOTE PLACE="marg">God giueth the first grace to re|pentance.</NOTE>
For when God giueth grace to any one
to examine his life, and to view his own
deformities, the first knowledge &amp; ap|prehensio~
of his misery is most terrible,
because his conscience dooth forcibly
check the former proceedings of his life
and violently hale him against the cur|re~t
of his own affection: for as riuers are
not forced against their ordinary streme
<PB N="172" REF="96">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="173" REF="96">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="174" REF="97">
but by the tide which is more forcible
then the streame; so our sinfull action,
(being in all men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The diffi|culty of re|pentance.</NOTE> a naturall and com|mon
motion) is not reformed in vs,
but by the Spirite of God, a power a|boue
our nature. Yet is it done, with
such contention in our flesh, and in
our nature, (as for the time) doth won|derfully
distract the soule of the party
repenting.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The reason.</NOTE> And needs it must: for he
that hath wasted his time in the deli|cacy
of fortune, glutting himselfe with
variety of pleasures, and in the height
of this vaine prosperity is admonished
that hee hath fedde on poyson, and
thereby runne his life into a desperate
hazard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The sorrow of a repen|tant soule.</NOTE> will (doubtles) endure the ex|tremity
of griefe that sudden feare
and amazednesse can lay vpon him
For so are sinnefull<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> men, who not re|garding
the danger of their soules be|fore
God and their conscience admo|nish
them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A sudden griefe is violent.</NOTE> are taken vnprouided with a
sudden griefe, which doth alway inflict
an vnexpressable measure of sorrowe,
and sometimes death and desperation.
Now as the Law teacheth vs to know
<PB N="175" REF="97">
our sinne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What must cure disea|sed soules.</NOTE> our miserable condition, and
the disease of our soules: so the Gos|pell
teacheth vs the cure, both what
and how to administer phisicke to our
diseased soules: for else were the
knowledge of our sinnes an extreme
misery without profite, if wee shoulde
not also know the meanes of our reco|uery,
and know also how to administer
and apply them. For vertue hath no
vertue but in vse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The vse of vertue.</NOTE> and that physicke
which the sicke patient receyueth not,
cannot profite him, bee it neuer so ex|cellent,
or standeth neuer so neare
him. But as in corporall, so in spiritu|all
sicknesses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The order in curing.</NOTE> the disease must first bee
knowne, the phisicke then admini|stred;
for hee that administreth before
hee knoweth the cause, or knoweth on|ly
the cause, and administreth not, can
neuer recouer his patient, be hee neuer
so industrious. In repentance therefore
and sorrow for sinne,) which is a sicke|nesse
of the soule) must be (necessarily)
considered these two particulars: The
cause,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cause of repen|tance.</NOTE> the cure. The cause is eyther the
materiall cause, or the mouing cause,
<PB N="176" REF="98">
the materiall cause is sin; that being the
matter of our offence; for which wee so
sorrow and grieue all the time of our
repentance. This is proued in the ex|amples
of all men that haue had the
grace of true and vnfaigened repen|tance;
euery penitent Child of grace
hauing sorrow and affliction in his
soule, because by his sinne he hath pro|uoked
his God, and his creator against
him. Thus did <HI>Iob</HI> and <HI>Dauid</HI> repent
them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob. 42. 6.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Sam. 12. 13.</NOTE> and so doe and will doe all that
would profite by theyr Repentance.
And here is necessarily to be obserued
that though our repentance haue re|spect
to the benefite of our owne
estates, as being a most necessary seruice
in our saluation:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> yet the maine respect
is had to God, whose glory wee must
preferre,<NOTE PLACE="marg">God must be respected before our soules.</NOTE> euen before the saluation of
our soules, making him the principall
and our selues but secondary respectes
of our repentance. And herein appea|reth
the difference betweene true and
false repentance. The false or godlesse
repentance sorroweth for sinne, but for
this cause only, that for their sinne God
<PB N="177" REF="98">
doth punish and afflict them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The diffe|rence be|tweene true and false repentance.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 9. 27</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Sam. 15 24 25.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. King. 21. 27.</NOTE> Therfore
their sorrow is chiefly for the punish|ment,
&amp; but respectiuly for the sin. Thus
did <HI>Pharaoh, Saul, Ahab,</HI> &amp; <HI>Iudas</HI> repent
them, and so do all false and fained re|penters,
that respect God for them|selues,
and not themselues for God. A
true and godly repentance sorroweth
for sin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 27. 3. 4</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">For what cause a god|ly repentant sorroweth.</NOTE> because it is sin, and not because
it deserueth punishment: and heere the
main respect is had to God, and to our
selues onely for Gods sake. For though
the dread and feare of punishment, be
sufficient to mooue any mans repen|tance,
yet we must not make that the
cause of our spirtiual sorrow: but much
rather because we haue offended so gra|cious
a God, who hath declared him|selfe
to vs in so many, &amp; so great demo~|strations
of loue, this ought to be more
sensible to our wounded soules the~ the
horror we haue of our condemnation.
Thus are holy men moued in the griefe
&amp; passion of their repenta~ce. The main
difference then betweene true and false
repentance is this: True repentance
is caused by a reuerence wee haue to
<PB N="178" REF="99">
the loue of God, false Repentance by
the feare wee haue of Gods iustice: the
one is the office of a slaue, the other
the office of a sonne: both of them re|penting
one matter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">God is the moving cause in e|very office of grace.</NOTE> but for diuers re|spects.
Sin then is the materiall cause of
Repentance. The mouing cause is God
who mouing his holy Spirite in the
hearts of his Elect, presents them the
vgly formes of their sins, awakes their
conscience, and stirs them to a serious
cogitation of their wretchednesse; gi|uing
them still such proportion of
grace, as the degrees of theyr Repen|tance
and spiritual sorrow shal require.
And that God is the first mouing cause
of godly repentance, is euident by ma|ny
places of Scripture; by these namely,
2. <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 25. where S. <HI>Paul</HI> aduising <HI>Ti|mothie</HI>
to instruct them that are contra|ry
minded, hee giueth this reason:<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Tim. 2. 25</NOTE> <HI>Be|cause
he shall thereby proue if God at any
time will giue them repentance, that they
may know the truth:</HI> Here repentance is
called the gift of God, which doth vt|terly
barre man from all cause of boa|sting
his ability in this necessatie dutie.
<PB N="179" REF="99">
Also in the 5. of the <HI>Act.</HI> 31. the Apo|stles
(prouing Iesus to be Christ &amp; God
coequall to his Father) vseth this argu|ment
before the councell of the Iewes:
<HI>That God had made him a Prince &amp; a Sa|utour,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 5. 31.</NOTE>
<HI>to giue repentance to Israel, and for|giuenesse
of sin,</HI> where the power of gi|uing
repentance, is made a proofe of
his diuinity, and interposed betweene
his office of Sauiour, and his power of
forgiuing sins. These places (out of ma|ny)
sufficiently proue, that God is the
first &amp; principall mouing cause of fruit|full
repentance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Obiect.</NOTE> Now it may bee de|maunded,
whether God moue repen|tance
in all them that repent for sin, or
in them onely that truly repent, and are
his chose~ elect. I answer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Answer.</NOTE> that God mo|ueth
this grace in his elect only because
they only make profitable vse of repen|tance,
&amp; that such as <HI>Soul</HI> and <HI>Ahab</HI> that
repented for priuate respects,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saul and Ahab.</NOTE> were not
moued by the spirite of grace, but by
their politique &amp; priuate regards only.
For wheresoeuer the holy Ghost shall
please to moue grace, it is not possible
that labour should be fruitlesse: neyther
<PB N="180" REF="100">
doth God euer misse in the purpose of
his ends.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> And therfore that repentance
which his holy Spirit causeth, he conti|nueth
to maturitie &amp; ripenesse of per|fection,
neuer fayling, neuer fainting in
his vndertakings. Thus much of the
cause of our spirituall sorrow (repen|ta~ce.)
Now of the cure or means of de|liuerance
from spirituall griefe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cure.</NOTE> In the
cure is considered, first the preparing &amp;
dressing of the wounded soule, wherby
it is made fit for curing. Secondly, the
matter to be applied to the soule. Third|ly,
the maner of applyment. In the
preparing of the wounded soule, there
are those 4. things necessary. First, a spi|rituall
sorrow for sin, that is, a sence of
sorrow in the soule, caused by a cogita|tion
of sin &amp; guiltinesse. And this is a
necessary preparatiue in a repe~ta~t soule:
for that soule ca~not desire a spiritual re|freshing,
that hath not first a sense of
sorrow, &amp; a feeling of present calamity.
This first preparatiue to repentance,
was in the Iewes, that were hearers of
holy <HI>Peter,</HI> when hee declared to them
their sin in crucifying the Lord Iesus.
<PB N="181" REF="100">
For the Text sayth:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 2. 37</NOTE> <HI>When they heard it,
they were pricked in their hearts, and
sayd: What shall wee doe?</HI> As if the prese~t
sorrow did so astonish them, as they
knew not what to do, nor what to ad|uise
themselues. The next preparatiue
is humble acknowledgement, that is,
an acknowledgment of the soule of the
misery it is in,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Humble acknow|ledgement.</NOTE> and an exposing of
such particular griefes as wee finde in
the register of our conscience. This al|so
is very necessary in the preparing of
our soules: for though God (the Phy|sition
of our soul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s) vnderstand our sins
better then our selues, and can remem|ber
them better then conscience; yet
is it but reason, that hee that desireth
the physicke of his soule, declare so
much of his griefe as hee can remem|ber:
not to instruct or helpe the know|ledge
of God, but to acknowledge our
selues and our dut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">full desires. This ac|knowledgement
of sin, was comon in
the custome of holy <HI>Dauid,</HI> how often
doth hee confesse his sinne, and ex|pose
his griefe before God?<NOTE PLACE="marg">The exam|ple of holy Dauid.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 32. 5.</NOTE> for God
is so desirous of our good, as that
<PB N="182" REF="101">
hee then readily helpeth vs, when wee
doe but (carefully) desire it. Therefore
sayth the Prophet <HI>Dauid: I sayd I would
confesse my sinne, and thou forgauest, &amp;c.
Dauid</HI> did but say he would confesse,
God taketh his word, and forgaue him
his sinne. And certainely, humble and
vnfained acknowledgement in our
repentance, is an vndoubted testimo|ny
that God doth giue vs grace, &amp; that
hee will giue vs fauour. Here is offe|red
occasion to dispute a large contro|uersie
touching auricular confessio~, the
which being conten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">iously disputed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Auricular confession.</NOTE>
hath kindled fire in the faith of manie,

in all, which is onely conuenient in
some.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Auricular con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ession rather poli|cy then pie|ty.</NOTE> For auricular confession (as now
it is vsed) is rather a state policy the~ re|ligious
piety, and therefore I dare not
command it, neyther will commend it.
The third preparatiue consisteth in ho|ly
action,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The third preparatiue.</NOTE> that is, when wee indeauour a
reformation of our selues, and declare
our Repentance in a conscionable dis|charge.
For though no man can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> satisfie
the iustice of God for sinne; that being
<PB N="183" REF="101">
possible for the Sonne of God onely:<NOTE PLACE="marg">No man can satisfie God.</NOTE>
yet ought all men to endeauour so
much as they haue power giuen them
to satisfie men. As for example; hee

to make restitution (if he bee able) and

<P>The last preparatiue is praier, that is
<PB N="184" REF="102">
a lifting vp of the heart to God, with
faith and hopeful confidence.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prayer.</NOTE> In the ex|ercise
of praier there is a double office.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 25. 1.</NOTE>
First, wee must expose our griefe. Se|condly,
we must implore fauour: for as
in the ordinary cures of Surgery, the
patient must first suffer his woundes to
bee ript,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> launst and searcht before the
playster can bee applyed to the sore:
so must we rip, and search the wounds
of our soule, empty the infectious mat|ter;
and when we haue it out, wee must
vse it as <HI>Hezechiah</HI> did the blasphe|mous
letter of <HI>Rabshaketh,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Kin. 19. 14. 15.</NOTE> spreads all
before the Lord; and then with ear|nest
humblenesse, implore his fauour,
point out our sinnes vnto him, and
confesse that these are they that haue
wounded our soules, troubled our con|science,
for which we grieue, for which
we pray. When the soule is thus prepa|red,
there is ioy in our repentant teares,
pleasure in our griefe, and hope in our
spirituall sorrow: and then, (and
not before) are wee made fitte to ap|prehend
and apply the saluation of
our soules, Christ Iesus. The second
<PB N="185" REF="102">
thing in the care of our soules,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The matter of the cure of our souls.</NOTE> is the
soueraigne matter by which the soule
is cured. That is the most soueraigne
Balsame, the sacred bloud of the
Lambe of GOD, of the Sonne of
God, shed for the Redemption of man|kinde:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Pet. 2. 2.</NOTE>
for so sayth his holy Apostle
Saint <HI>Peter, 1. Pet. 2. 24. Who his owne
selfe bare our sinnes in his body on the tree,
that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ee being deliuered from sinne should
liue in righteousnesse, by whose stripes we
were healed.</HI> Our sinnes are taken
from vs, by his bearing them: our

our eternall death preuented by his
temporall death: for but the Sonne
of GOD (Christ Iesus,) there is no
Empiricke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No physick but the bloud of Christ can cure a woun+ded soule.</NOTE> no quintessence, no Phy|sicke,
can cure a wounded soule: so
venemous is sinne, and so incurable
are the wounds of sinne: only the bloud
of the holy Lambe is able to deliuer
and heale; and that is both so certaine,
and present in vertuous operation, as
that one droppe (rightly applyed) is
sufficient to cure the wounds of a world
of soules. The last thing is the cure of
<PB N="186" REF="103">
our soules, is the manner of applying
this most Soueraigne medicine Christ
Iesus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The maner of applying Christ.</NOTE> and that is by a true and a liuelie
faith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 11. 6.</NOTE> for without faith it is impossible
to please God: and without faith it
is impossible to apprehend the Sonne
of God. Neyther neede this seeme
strange to a Christian iudgement, that
wee should bee able by faith to appre|hend
Christ, and apply him to our re|pentant
soules: for hee himselfe hath
taught vs, that whatsoeuer wee shall
aske in prayer (if we belieue) wee shall
haue it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 21. 22.</NOTE> Where hee maketh faith to bee
the couenant and condition of pray|er,
and promiseth that such prayer shal
onely and alwayes preuaile, that is dire|cted
by a liuing faith, against which
there is no resistance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">No resista~ce against a true faith.</NOTE> Therefore to ap|prehend
Christ Iesus, and to apply him
to our wounded soules, we must reach
our handes of faith to the bosome of
his Father, and by faith take him from
the altar of his Crosse, and by faith ap|ply
his bloud, (nay, his bloudy bo|dy)
to our wounded soules. For hee
that doth it faithfully, doth it effectu|ly,
<PB N="187" REF="103">
and shal doubtlesse find assurance in
himselfe, that the woundes of his soule
are cured; and that sinne is for euer
disinabled from doing his soule hurt,
that hath Iesus Christ his Redeemer
faithfully applyed vnto it. For where
hee is in his mercy, there is assurance,
and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">afety of diuine protection,
And this is the order I aduise all chri|stians
in their repentance and spirituall
sorrow.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> First, that they prepare
their soules, and that then they apply
Iesus Christ their saluation, In whom
there is safety, without whome, none.
I might heere bee large in declaring

<P>This doctrine of Repentance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vse.</NOTE> and
spirituall sorrow doth remember all
men many very needfull admonish|ments.
First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">First.</NOTE> seeing that sinne is the
cause for which wee repent vs, and by
whose poysonsome meanes our soules
are so grieuously wounded, and so
fowly deformed; it ought to moue al
men to a loathing and detestation of
sinne, by which we are both grieued in
our selues, &amp; brought in the hatred and
displeasure of almighty God.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> For if we
carefully auoyd all such annoyances as
bring any little taste of griefe to our bo|dies,
or to our temporall life, wee ought
much more carefully to auoyde sinne,
which causeth such extremity of griefe
in our soules, and doth both depriue vs
of Gods fauour, &amp; bring an euerlasting
destruction vpon vs. Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Secondly.</NOTE> seeing
there is no repentance profitable to sal|uation,
<PB N="189" REF="104">
but that which is caused in vs,
by the mouing of Gods holy Spirit,
it behoueth all men to bee serious in
their repentance, and not to content
themselues with a slender examination
of their sinnes, and then againe to re|turn
to their former disobedience, and
remissnesse; but to be carefull to repent
al sinne, and to be constant in that care,
no alteration, no interruption, and that
our repentance respect rather a shame
and griefe to haue offended a gracious
God, then any feare of temporall or e|ternall
punishment: lest by such repen|tance
they gaine no more then <HI>Saul</HI> &amp;
<HI>Ahab;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Saules and Ahabs re|pentance.</NOTE> the one nothing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. King. 21 27.</NOTE> the other no|thing
but a short temporall blessing:
both of the~ leesing their soules by their
false and fained repentance. Thirdly, se|ing
the soule cannot be cured by repen|tance,
neither can apply or apprehend
Christ Iesus, vnlesse it bee first prepared
&amp; made fit by the exercise of these du|ties,
it therefore behoueth all men to be
carefully precise in the office of these
duties, &amp; not to satisfie themselues with
the exercise of one or two of them,
<PB N="190" REF="105">
but to indeauour them all, because they
are al necessary in our true repentance
for as in the commaundements of the
law, he that fayleth in one, breaketh al:
so in these duties of repentanc, he that
neglecteth one, profiteth by none, but
annihilateth the purpose of his spiritu|all
sorrow. Let no man therfore flat|ter
himselfe with this presumption,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The danger of presump|tion.</NOTE>
that if hee haue beene an extortioner, a
thiefe, or a godlesse person, that his re|pentance
will suffice him, if he be sorry
for his sinnes, and acknowledge them
to God, for those though they bee ne|cessary
duties, they are not all the duties
of our soules in our preparation to re|pentance.
Therefore if he haue extor|ted,
or (as <HI>Zacheus</HI> did, taken by forged
cauillation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">k. 19. 8.</NOTE> (that is by any indirect or
dishonest meanes) hee must repent as
<HI>Zacheus</HI> did, and make restitution (if he
can) and as farre as he can: otherwise
saluation can neuer come to his house.
Therefore as they are all necessary, so
they are ioyntly necessary, euery man
being bound to all these duties, as God
and grace shall inable him.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="105">Fourthly, seeing Christ Iesus is that
Empericke, and that onely salue which
is able to cure a wounded sinfull soule,
and that without him there is no wor|king,
no cause, no meanes of spirituall

Christ their saluation, to sell all they

his bloud, &amp; of his righteousnesse, nay,
and to despise all thinges in respect of
him their Sauiour, and the onelie
Soveraigne salue for their wounded
soules.</P>
<P>And that seeing wee haue Iesus
Christ the Sonne of God proposed vs
to be our saluation, who is alwaies rea|dy,
and alwayes willing to bee appre|hended,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The wil|lingnesse of Christ to be apprehen|ded.</NOTE>
and to bee applyed to our
soules: by whom onely wee enioy the
peace of conscience, and the hope of

the besotted people of this world

woundes both in number and griefe,
and making the soule vncapable of
cure, and most vnfitte to haue the

<P>Lastly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fiftly.</NOTE> seeing there is no meanes
to apprehend and apply this Christ, the
physition, and physick of our soules, but
onely by a true, liuely and a iustifying
faith, therefore it most necessarily con|cerneth
all men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ can not be ap|prehended but by a true faith onely.</NOTE> to haue this means of
apprehending Christ; because (as I haue
sayd) the salue though most soueraign)
cannot profite the sore, vnlesse it be ap|plyed,
that being the very maine act of
our spirituall health, alll other duties
and offices beeing but circumstances,
to assist and forward this act. Moreourr
the faith by which wee apprehend
Christ, must be more then a common
<PB N="193" REF="106">
or a generall faith. For it profiteth not
to our health and saluation, to knowe
onelie that Iesus Christ is the present
cure of our soules, vnlesse wee also by a
confident and liuely faith, apprehende
and apply him to the sore of our soules.
Againe, seeing Christ is our onely sal|uation,
&amp; seeing faith is the only means
of apprehending it, we ought not to ap|point
other matter of saluation, neither
any other maner of applying it. And
therfore no man ought to ascribe righ|teousnesse
to himself, to his own works,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE>
or the supererogatiue workes of his
friendes, but onely to Iesus Christ, and
that this Christ is onely apprehended
by a sauing faith.</P>

because nothing can apprehend and

what it is, and of what Nature.

my faith it selfe then must needes bee

I will therefore bee plentifull in

When I haue thus done, I knowe

his sacred bloud; and with a won|derfull
degree of comfort, I will apply

<HEAD>Of Mortification.
Chap. 4.</HEAD>
<P>_HE that is resolued to in|deuour
his godly repe~|tance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mortificati|on.</NOTE>
and laboreth the
reformation of his sin|full
life, must labour
two thinges principal|ly,
and of necessity; the first is Morti|fication,
the next regeneration. He
must first destroy his sinnefull estate,
before he can obtaine the state of grace.
For God and the gifts of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> are so
absolute holy, as that they cannot ad|mit
any mixture or cooperation with
sinne and wicked action. For as in the
curing of bodies infected with poyson|nous
diseases, the Physition by seuerity
and strict dyet, bringeth downe the
body of his patient to extreme pouer|ty,
<PB N="199" REF="109">
and leannes, and then in that extre|mity,
helpeth the weakenesse of Na|ture;
and by restoratiues, and requisite
dyet, bringeth a new flesh wholesome
and without disease, the former disea|sed
flesh being first wasted, and vtterly
consumed with the extremity of phy|sick.
So he that is resolued in his repen|tance,
and hath a loathing and detesta|tion
of his sins, and a desire to free his
soule from the contagion of sinne, must
resolue also to endure such bitter Phy|sicke
and strict dyet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How to mortifie our diseased actions.</NOTE> as the iudgement
of spiritual phisick doth prescribe him;
whereby all the euill, depraued and cor|rupt
affections of his soule, may bee vt|terly
wasted, and thereby his soule may
haue new and fresh indument of grace,
without taint, without disease, without
griefe. This was figured in the manner
of Gods calling <HI>Moses</HI> to his princely
and Propheticall office. For when <HI>Mo|ses</HI>
made offer to come neare the pre|sence
of God in the bush,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ex. 3. 5.</NOTE> God forbad
him: <HI>Come not hither</HI> (saith God,) <HI>put off
thy shoes of thy feet.</HI> That is before thou
presume to approch my presence, thou
<PB N="200" REF="110">
must first put off thy shooes, that is,
thy sinnefull and corrupt affections for
hee that hath base and vile affections
is not worthy, is not fitte for the pre|sence
of GOD. It was also in the
order of the Ceremoniall Law, that
they who were polluted (were it but
with the touch of any vncleane thing)
were for a time <HI>Prohibited the Sanctua|ry,
and the presence of God:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Leuit. 15. 2. &amp;c.</NOTE> and had
a time limited to cleanse them, before
they were admitted and allowed for
cleane persons. All which Ceremonies
doe but note vnto vs the Nature of
holinesse, how vnpossible it is to bee
reconciled with sinne, that as the two
contrary Elements, Fire and Water,
cannot possibly bee in any one Sub|iect
without intestine strife: so God
and <HI>Beliall,</HI> grace and sinne, can neuer
conspire in any one particular: but
where grace is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No peace betweene God and Belial.</NOTE> sinne cannot be, and
where sinne is, grace will not bee: there
being in them a full opposition of Na|ture,
not to be reconciled. There|fore
it is necessary, that before wee
entertaine the graces of Gods Holy
<PB N="201" REF="110">
Spirite, wee first discharge our sinnes,
which haue had entertainement in
vs, and before wee can bee regene|rate,
and made the sonnes of GOD,
wee must mortifie our affections,
whereby we were made the seruants of
Sinne.</P>
<P>Saint <HI>Paul</HI> admonishing the <HI>Colos|sians</HI>
to an imitation of Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Paules direction.</NOTE> and
his holinesse, aduiseth first to Mor|tification,
as if without that meanes,

therefore</HI> (sayth hee) <HI>your Members
which are on the earth, For nication,

liue after the flesh, yee shall die: but if yee
mortifie the deedes of the body by the spi|rit,
yee shall liue.</HI> By which place wee are
taught, what mortification is, and of
what necessity it is.</P>
<P>Mortification is a decay or peri|shing
the deedes of our flesh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Mor|tification is.</NOTE> by the
grace and operation of Gods Spi|rite.
By the deeds of our flesh, is meant
not onely our euill actions, but our
<PB N="202" REF="111">
desires and carnall affections also; the
which Saint <HI>Paul</HI> doth particularize in
the Verse before alleadged: where
he calleth their generall name <HI>members
on the earth. Mortifie therefore your mem|bers
which are on the earth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Colos. 3. 5</NOTE> <HI>fornicatio~, vn|cleannesse,
the inordinate affection, euill
concupiscence, and couetousnesse, which is
idolatry.</HI> In which hee comprehendeth
(not onely) our actions, but affecti|ons;
nay, the very naturall concupis|cence,
and deprauednesse of our Na|ture.
Not that any man is able to
performe these dueties exactly; but
exactly to endeuour them, and that
our defectes may bee in our power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To ende|vour exactly is exactly to performe.</NOTE>
and not in our purpose and endeauour.
And this is the meaning of that Apo|stle,
in naming (for the matter of
mortification) sinnes of action, sinnes
of affection, and sinnes of naturall des|cent.</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Secondly.</NOTE> mortification is an office of
the spirit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Question.</NOTE> &amp; here importeth a question,
whether the word spirite in this place
is to be meant of the Spirite of God,
the Holy Ghost, or of the Spirite of
<PB N="203" REF="111">
man our naturall soule. I answere,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Answer.</NOTE> that
the Spirit executing this office of mor|tification,
is principally meant of the
holy Ghost, who giueth the first
motion of desire in euery Godlie
Act. It is respectiuely also meant
of the care and trauell of our owne
spirites or soules, not that our own spi|rits
can cause our owne mortification,
but being first caused by Gods Spirite,
it is entertained and continued by the
exercise of our owne Spirites, our
Spirites hauing no such strength in
theyr owne Nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> but as they are
prepared by the Grace of the Holy
Ghost. For, as in the casting of a stone
or running of a Bowle, though the
strength of the arme giue the first mo|tion
to the bowle or stone; yet after|wards
is the motion continued a com|petent
time, as wel because of the pow|erfull
mouing of the arme, as also be|cause
of the naturall fitnesse of the
thing moued. So in the office of mor|tification,
and in all other diuine of|fices
of the Soule,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No soule can moue it selfe to di|uine action&punc;</NOTE> though the Soule
moue not it selfe to these holy actions;
<PB N="204" REF="112">
yet by reason of the spirituall nature
of our soules, when it is once mo|ued
by the Holy Ghost, it then conti|nueth
such motion, euen to perfecti|on;
so that the prime houre of the ho|ly
exercise of Mortification (and so of
all other spirituall offices) is wholy to
to bee ascribed to the power of Gods
holy Spirit, which moueth in our harts
enery act, and euery purpose of well
doing.</P>
<P>Thirdly, there is a necessary of mor|tification
imposed vpon euery man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thirdly.</NOTE> vp|on
the paine of condemnation. This is
implyed in the words of S. <HI>Paul</HI> in the
place before alledged, <HI>Rom. 8. 13. For
if ye liue after the Flesh, ye shall die, but if
ye mortifie the deeds of the body by the spi|rit,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 8. 13.</NOTE>
<HI>ye shall liue.</HI> Where the Apostle pro|poseth
life and death before the <HI>Ro|manes,</HI>
admonishing that of a necessity
they must chuse one,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Life and death is proposed euery man.</NOTE> eyther to mortifie
the flesh and liue, or else to pamper the
flesh, and die; there being no meanes,
no cause of auoidance of this necessity.

For as the blade of seede corne cannot

rotten in the Earth: and as there
cannot bee a Resurrection to Life, be|fore
there bee first a separation and

<P>These thinges are most materiall in

<DIV2 TYPE="application">

<P>The necessity of Mortification,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The vse.</NOTE>
doth require in euery one an exact di|ligence

will thinke it expedient, nay, necessary

then himselfe, for one of the two must
of necessity be mortified, suffer death,

<PB N="207" REF="113">
of mortification, as a duty too precise
and of grieuous performance; and shal
thinke that mortification is not of ne|cessary
substance, but rather a seuere
circumstance, which may bee safelie a|uoided;
to him I will say with indigna|tion,
as S. <HI>Paul</HI> sayth to the <HI>Corinthians</HI>
with admiration:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 15. 36.</NOTE> <HI>O foule, that which thou

God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How to esteem God the soule, and sin.</NOTE> and the saluation of his soule.
Therefore it most neerely respecteth al
men, not to esteeme their sinne, which
is their enemy, &amp; would destroy them,
more then God that is their friend, and
would saue them; nay, more then theyr
soules, and their owne saluation; but to
despise their sinnes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Man must warre vpon himselfe.</NOTE> nay themselues in
respect of God, and saluation. And
therefore let euery man make war vp|on

all to hate as God hateth, euen
all sinne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Men must hate as God hateth.</NOTE> because all sin is in Gods ha|tred;

<HI>Amalekites,</HI> God hath commanded vs

<HEAD>Of Regeneration, or new

Chap. 5.</HEAD>
<P>_WHen all thinges were
first created,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 1. 31.</NOTE> euery
thing was perfectly
good; no defect, no
blemish, no need of
correction. The first defection was sin:
<PB N="214" REF="117">
the first sin was the sinne of Angels, the
next the sin of man. God punished the
sinne of Angels in their owne particu|lars
onely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The reason why God did punish the angels in their owne particulars only, but man, in him selfe and posterity.</NOTE> because they were not to
deriue their natures to posteritie by
generation and natural descent; and be|cause
they were ordained for the ser|uice
of God in certain peculiar offices
in the gouernement of his Creatures:
the Creatures not being ordained for
their seruice. But man for whome all
thinges, (euen the Angells themselues)
were created, &amp; from whom was to be
deriued a world of people, when hee
sinned, God punished man himselfe,
his posterity and the creatures hee had
made and giuen him, For as the sinne
of man had infected the whole house
of man (the whole World beeing then
his house) so the curse of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 3. 17.</NOTE> and the
marke of his displeasure was seated on
that house (the world) all thinges being
subiect to alteration, &amp; euil change. Fro~
this cause is the necessity of regenera|tion,
al things being now (in their owne
nature) in the state of corruption, and
death. And therfore saith S. <HI>Peter,</HI> when
<PB N="215" REF="117">
shall come to iudgment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Pet. 3. 10.</NOTE> <HI>the heauens shal
passe away with noyse, &amp; the elements shal
melt with heat, &amp; the earth with the works
that are therein shall be burnt vp:</HI> and that
<HI>there shal be a new heauen, and a new earth
according to Gods promise,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vers. 13.</NOTE> <HI>wherin dwels
righteousnesse.</HI> So that nothing shall bee
able to abide the glory of Gods pre|sence,
but that which is reformed, and
regenerate, not the elements, not hea|uen
it selfe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sin defor|med all, Grace re|formeth all.</NOTE> but as all haue endured (for
sinne) the bad alteration, so they must
also endeuour (by grace) the good alte|ration:
all were transformed by sinne,
all must be reformed againe by grace,
or else remaine in their deformity. And
Saint <HI>Paul</HI> is peremptory in this opini|on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 6. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>
<HI>For in Christ Iesus</HI> (saith he) <HI>neyther
circumcision auayleth any thing, nor vncir|cumcision,
but a new creature:</HI> that is, a re|generation
by an effectual faith, is only
necessary: all ceremony being insuffi|cient
and not effectuall. And our Saui|our
Christ to <HI>Nicodemus</HI> preached the
necessity of regeneration, and affirmeth
his doctrine with a double asseuerati|on.
<HI>Verily, verily I say vnto thee, except a

suffice to perswade the necessary know|ledge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No regene|ration, no saluation.</NOTE>
and the necessary care of regene|ration,
being that without which it is
impossible to be saued. Now it impor|teth
to know what regeneration is.</P>
<P>Regeneration is an act of the holy
Ghost in Gods elect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What rege|neration is.</NOTE> whereby they are
admitted or entred into a constant and
faithfull exercise of a godly life. First, it
is an act of the holy Ghost: for, as I haue
before sayde, all grace is the gift of
God, and euery motion to goodnes is
caused by the spirite of God onely;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iam. 1. 17</NOTE> our
selues being meerly passiue in all diuine
exercise, God himselfe being the actor,
and principall mouer. For as hee that
learneth to write,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Holy Ghost, our spirituall teacher.</NOTE> hath his hand first
led by the direction of his teacher, be|fore
he can merit any little commenda|tion:
so the holy Ghost (by whose di|rections
wee learne the vse of all spiri|tuall
exercise) doth moue both our ca|pacity
and power, to vnderstand the
knowledge &amp; vse of necessary Christi|an
<PB N="217" REF="118">
an performance, without which Ma|ster,
we should neuer bee able to com|prehend
the rudimentes and first ele|ments
of diuine learning. Regenerati|on
then being a Christian office of most
necessary performance, it must needes
bee caused in vs by the holy Ghost;
who is the first mouer of euer grace.
This doctrine Saint <HI>Peter</HI> concludeth<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Pet. 1. 3.</NOTE>
in expresse words: <HI>Blessed</HI> (sayth he) <HI>be
God, euen the Father of our Lord Iesus
Christ, which according to his aboundant
mercy hath begotten vs againe vnto a liue|ly
hope, by the resurrection of Iesus Christ
from the dead:</HI> So that we are regenerate
or new begotte~ by God in Iesus Christ
at the motion &amp; instance of his aboun|dant
mercy.</P>
<P>Secondly, this act of Regeneration
by the holy Ghost,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Secondly.</NOTE> is caused in the
heartes of GODS elect onely. This
Doctrine is grounded vpon this Con|clusion:
That GODS labour is
neuer fruitlesse;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iam. 1. 17.</NOTE> but what hee attemp|teth
is finished, there beeing no resi|stance
to his power, nor any greater to
countermand him. As holy <HI>Dauid</HI> saith:
<PB N="216" REF="119">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="217" REF="119">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="218" REF="120">
<HI>The Lord hath done whatsoeuer pleased
him.</HI> And therefore this grace is moued
in the Elect onely, because the elect
onely haue the benefite of all grace.
And S. <HI>Paul</HI> chargeth all men that chal|lenge
any part in Christ, that they be|come
new and regenerate. <HI>Therefore</HI>
(sayth hee,)<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 5. 17</NOTE> <HI>If any man bee in Christ, let
him bee a new creature,</HI> 2. Cor. 5. 17. As if
to be in Christ, and to bee a new crea|ture,
were reciprocall, all that were in
Christ to bee regenerate, and all that
were regenerate, to be in Christ: the
elect beeing onely in Christ, and rege|nerate
onely.</P>
<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thirdly.</NOTE> by this act of grace they are
admitted and entred into the exercise
of godlinesse. For howsoeuer before
we are regenerate, &amp; come to be made
(as it were) the very actuall sonnes of
God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Regenerati|on maketh vs the sons of God.</NOTE> by spirituall regeneration, wee
passe many dueties of holinesse which
may promise vs an extraordinary de|gree
of hope that we are in Gods fauor;
yet haue wee then our best assurance,
when wee are adopted his children by
regeneration: for then wee bring our
<PB N="219" REF="120">
holy purpose of reformation into act,
and faithfully endeauour those dueties
which (before) we had only determined
And (therefore) S. <HI>Iames</HI> speaking of
this spirituall generation, saith: <HI>Of his
owne will begat he vs with the worde of</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iam. 1. 18.</NOTE>
<HI>truth, that we should bee as the first fruites
of his creatures, Iam.</HI> 1. 18. That is, when
we are regenerate, and made the sons
of God, we are then fruitfull, &amp; not be|fore;
we are Gods first fruites, because
we are then first fruitfull.</P>
<P>Fourthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fourthly.</NOTE> the exercise of good works
in the regenerate, must haue two spe|cial
properties: first it must be faithfull,
then consta~t. It must be faithful because
of this ground:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 14. 23</NOTE> <HI>Whatsoeuer is not of faith
is sin. Rom:</HI> 14. It must be constant be|cause
of this: That not those that saint
in the race of godlines, but those that
run on with hope &amp; alacrity shall ob|taine
the garland: for so sayth the holy
Ghost by S. <HI>Iohn:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reu. 1. 26.</NOTE> <HI>He that ouer commeth &amp;

I giue power ouer natio~s.</HI> Not he that en|deuoreth
the beginning, the middle, or
a part of his life, but he that endureth to
<PB N="220" REF="121">
the end, hee shall bee saued. And the
Authour to the Hebrewes, admoni|nisheth
all men, <HI>that they run with pati|ence
the race that is set before them, looking
vnto Iesus the Author and finisher of their
faith &amp;c.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 12. 1. 2</NOTE> forsaluation by Iesus Christ,
is that crowne of glory for which all
runne, which none can gaine but hee
that runneth the race of his life faith|fully
and constantly.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 9. 24</NOTE> Therefore saith S.
<HI>Paul: So run that yee moy obtaine.</HI> That
is endeuour your strength with your
time to the vttermost, for though yee
begin well, it is nothing vnlesse yee also
end well.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Qualis vita finis. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE> For as the tree falleth so it ly|eth,
and as men dye, so they shal rise to
iudgement, for the graue can giue no
holinesse, no perfection; but doth one|ly
continue vs in the state it found vs.
Now if any man obiect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn. 3. 4. 6.</NOTE> as <HI>Nicodemus</HI>
did to Christ, <HI>How can these thinges be?
Can a man bee borne which is olde? Can he
enter into his mothers wombe again, and
bee borne?</HI> The answer that Christ made
to <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> may auswere such questi|ons.
First. he sayth, <HI>that except a man be
borne of water &amp; the Spiri, he cannot en|ter
<PB N="221" REF="121">
into the Kingdome of God.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Verse 5.</NOTE> That an|sweres
the necessity. Secondly, to teach
him the manner of regeneration, how
the children of God be borne a new,
how it is caused by the secret working
of Gods Spirite in the Children of
grace, he maketh a familiar comparison
or giueth instance by the mouing of
the ayre. That as when wee heare the
whistling of the winde, wee know it
bloweth, yet cannot wee know from
whence: so in the act of regeneration,
when we feele in our hearts the moti|on
of Gods holy Spirite, breathing sal|uation
into our soules. And when our
workes, and consciences giue vs vn|doubted
testimony,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No man ought to search the secret wor|kings of Gods Spirite.</NOTE> that wee are rege|nerate
and borne of God, it is then as
vaine a care to search the secret wor|kings
of Gods Spirit, and by what acti|ons
and circumstance God hath be|gotten
vs by the Spirite, as to enquirc
of the wind, whence it came, or whither
it would; this thing being not necessary
though regeneration it selfe bee most

<PB N="223" REF="122">
and safely without presumption to
conclude our owne ioy: that if we be
truely regenerate, we shall certainly be
saued; it being as impossible to seuer
saluation from regeneration, as God
from his Sonne. And therefore the ho|ly
Scripture concludeth the necessitie
of their saluation that are regenerate
and borne of God: <HI>Whosoeuer</HI> (sayth S.
<HI>Iohn) is borne of God sinneth not, for his
seede remayneth in him, neyther can he sin
because he is borne of God. 1. Iohn.</HI> 3&punc; 9.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Ioh. 3. 9.</NOTE>
Saint <HI>Iohn</HI> sayth hee cannot sinne, that
is, not commit sinne of purpose,
but of infirmity: and such sinnes
God will not impute to his adopted &amp;
regenerate children. And of this kinde
are those sinnes Saint <HI>Iohn</HI> meaneth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Ioh. 5. 17.</NOTE>
when he sayth: <HI>Al vnrighteousnesse is sin,
but there is a sinne not vnto death:</HI> and
that is the sinne of them that are rege|nerate,
who though they sinne, yet they
sinne not vnto death, theyr sinne being
onely a sinne in nature, and not a sinne
to condemne them.</P>
<P>This may prouoke all men to haue a
zealous care to bee regenerate: for by
<PB N="224" REF="123">
being regenerate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The rege|nerate can|not sinne to death.</NOTE> he shall haue honour
with securitie; honour in being the a|dopted
sonne of God, securitie in that

his innocency; for <HI>Adam</HI> was but Gods
seruant, he shall be Gods sonne. <HI>Adam</HI>
had power to fall, &amp; did fal from grace;
he neyther will nor can fall from grace,
the Spirit of God supporting him in a
sufficient strength of holinesse.</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Secondly.</NOTE> seeing regeneration is an
act of the Holy Ghost, euery man
ought so to rectifie and reform the er|rours
of his life, as that the Spirite of
God may not take loathing to enter

and holy exercise, we may bee
prepared to entertain that sacred guest
into our heartes; least when hee com|meth,
he find vs as God will find the re|probate

carelesse, and secure: and so
not seale vs for the sonnes of God, but
mark vs the children of death, and the
<PB N="225" REF="123">
friends of Antichrist. Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thirdly.</NOTE> seeing
the Elect only are regenerate, &amp; made
the children of God, it ought therefore
to be the principal care of euery man to
be regenerate; because regeneration is
the vndoubted witnes of Election; and
S. <HI>Peter</HI> biddeth vs <HI>giue diligence to make
our Calling and Election sure,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Pet. 1. 10.</NOTE> which can
no way be better assured vs, then by as|suring
our Regeneration, which is the
certificate &amp; testimony of our election.
Fourthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fourthly.</NOTE> seeing regeneration is an en|trance
into holy action, it remembreth
all men, that before they be regenerate,
all their actions, and all their endeuors
are but sinne: &amp; that those works which
in a regenerate man are ornaments and
graces,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The best actions of the vnrege|rate are sin.</NOTE> are in them blemishes and sin;
because before wee be Regenerate and

<HEAD>Of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ustification.
Chap. 6.</HEAD>
<P>_IVstification is a graci|ous
forgiuing of sins,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Iusti|fication is.</NOTE>
by imputation of the
righteousnes of Iesus
Christ. S. <HI>Paul</HI> expo|stulateth
this doctrine
with the <HI>Galatia~s,</HI> whom he calleth foo|lish
for doubting it:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 3. 2.</NOTE> <HI>This onely (sayth he)
would I learne of you, receyued ye the spirit
by the works of the law, or by the hearing of
faith preached?</HI> And in the next verse. <HI>Are
ye so foolish, that after ye haue begun in the
Spirit,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ver. 3.</NOTE> <HI>ye would now be made perfect by the
flesh?</HI> Where he admireth their simpli|city
that seek righteousnes in the flesh,
<PB N="231" REF="126">
or in the law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iustificatio~ is of the spi|rite, not of flesh.</NOTE> but rather and onely by
the meanes of faith; because our iusti|fication
is spirituall, &amp; not of the flesh.
And this doctrine hee concludeth by
an inuincible argument in the 26. vers.
That seeing we are regenerate, &amp; made
the sonnes of God by faith in Christ,
we are therfore also iustified and made
the seruants of God by faith.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 3. 26,</NOTE> <HI>For (saith
he) wee are all the sonnes of God by faith
in Christ Iesus.</HI> And if faith be able to
make vs sonnes, it must also bee able to
make vs seruants; for that which is able
in the greater performance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The neare|nes of iusti|fication and regenera|tion.</NOTE> is able in
the lesse. Besides regeneration &amp; iusti|fication
haue such relation and neare|nesse
to one another, as that they seeme
to be (almost) but one act, caused and
effected at one instant of time. For
when wee are regenerate, wee are then
iustified, and when wee are iustified,
we are then regenerate, and not before;
these two offices in our saluation being
distinguished rather by their names,
then by any speciall marke of difference
in their seuerall executions. Again,
the same Apostle in his Sermon at <HI>An|tioch,</HI>
<PB N="232" REF="127">
concludeth both the negatiue and
affirmatiue part of this question:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 13. 38.</NOTE> <HI>Bee it
knowne</HI> (sayth he) <HI>vnto you men and bre|thren,
that through this man</HI> (that is
Christ) <HI>is preached vnto you the forgiue|nesse
of sinnes,</HI> Verse. 39.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Verse 39.</NOTE> <HI>And from all
thinges, from which yee could not be iusti|fied
by the law of</HI> Moses, <HI>by him euery one
that beleeueth is iustified.</HI> So that he ab|solutely
denyeth the power of iustifica|tion
to the Workes of the Law, and
doth absolutely ascribe it to the power
of faith.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 2. 21:</NOTE> And he giueth a reason of
this Doctrine, in the 2. 21. to the <HI>Ga|latians:
For if righteousnesse bee by the
Law, then Christ dyed without a cause:</HI>
So that the very cause why CHRIST
dyed, was, that righteousnesse might
bee imputed and apprehended by
Faith; seeing by workes it was impos|sible.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal: 32, 1, 2</NOTE>
And therefore sayth the Pro|phet
<HI>Dauid: Blessed is hee whose vn|righteousnesse
is forgiuen, and whose sinne
is couered.</HI> And <HI>blessed is the Man,
to whome the Lord imputeth no sinne.</HI>
So that hee thinketh them most righ|teous,
that haue theyr vnrighteous|nesse
<PB N="283" REF="127">

holy that haue their sinnes not impu|ted.</P>
<P>The fourth to the <HI>Romanes,</HI> the
whole Chapter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 4,</NOTE> is an earnest proofe
of this Doctrine, where the Apostle
laboureth by direct euidence to sa|tisfie
all doubte: as if hee had fore|knowne
the stiffe and vnreconcilea|ble
Oppositions of these times a|gainst
his doctrine of Iustification.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The con|troversie of iustification</NOTE></P>
<P>In which Chapter he maketh <HI>Abra|ham</HI>
his instance; in whome there was
as much righteousnesse, and as much
cause of boasting it, as in any other
particular (saue Christ Iesus onely,)
yet hee there prooueth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The exam|ple of holy Abraham&punc;</NOTE> that this <HI>A|braham,</HI>
(vpon whome GOD had
founded his peculiar people) was
not iustified by the righteousnesse
of his Workes: but that his Faith was
imputed to him for righteousnesse:
And alleadgeth Scripture for this
proofe:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 15. 6.</NOTE> And <HI>Abraham beleeued the
Lord, and hee counted that to him for
righteousnesse:</HI> The word <HI>That,</HI> ha|uing
a direct relation to the Word<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="234" REF="128">
beleeued. And this righteousnes by
faith, hee ascribeth not onely to <HI>Abra|hams</HI>
particular: <HI>But to vs also, to whome
it shall be imputed for righteousnes, which
belieue in him,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 4. 24 25.</NOTE> <HI>that raysed vp Iesus our
Lord from the dead.</HI> Verse 25. <HI>Who was
deliuered to death for our sinnes, and is
risen againe for our iustification.</HI> So that
the matter of our iustification is the
righteousnesse of Iesus Christ onelie:
and the meanes of apprehending it, is
faith onely.</P>
<P>This doctrine, howsoeuer it is made
strong and vnresistable by many testi|monies
of holy Scripture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The religi|ons of these times.</NOTE> and though
it bee zealously maintained by men of
learned and religious iudgement, yet
hath it endured violence, and suffered
disgrace, both by ignorance and enuy:
this age maintaining such oppositions
of errour, as the ignorance of former
times first occasioned. Therefore is
it that the mayne controuersie of the
world is at this day in this Argument
of iustification: the one maintaining
iustification by faith: the other by
workes; that defending trueth, this
<PB N="235" REF="128">
opposing it. And though I am most
willing to quarrell in defence of faith:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 6. 16.</NOTE>
faith being my shield of defence a|gainst
sinne and the Diuell, yet know
I not how to giue addition of strength
to them that farre exceede mee, and
whose faithfull paines haue maintay|ned
this quarrell with valour and vic|tory
against all opposition. Neither
is it in the purpose of this businesse to
dispute questions of truth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The pur|pose of this labour.</NOTE> but to deli|uer
truth as it is, by admonitions and
plaine teachings, to men of simple &amp;
easie vnderstandings: for whose christi|an
good, these pains are principally vn|dertaken;
and whose simplicities might
most easily bee confounded in the intri|tate
search of cunning Argumentes,
For these respectes, and because all

in the hatred of my Nature, I will spa|ringly
deliuer my selfe in a large Ar|gument,

and that by a familiar proofe I
may instruct the knowledge of him
<PB N="236" REF="129">
that is lesse learned. They that denie
iustification by faith, and approue it by

from the testimony of Saint <HI>Iames,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iam. 2.</NOTE>
who speaking of a generall faith doth
vtterly disinable it from the office of
iustification.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vers. 17.</NOTE> And therfore he saith that
faith, if it haue no workes, is dead in it

without workes is not liuing, is not
sauing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Faith with|out workes is no faith, but a bare name onely.</NOTE> nay is not faith, but onely a ge|neral

conclude against all such faith. But if
there be a faith that hath depending of

as the soule to the body, and the fruit to

with Saint <HI>Iames</HI> conclude against
them; for hee doth not (as they doe)
disinable all faith in the worke of iusti|fication;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ver. 26.</NOTE>
but that faith onely which is
deade, and without workes, So that
both opinions implore a necessity of
workes, the one as the cause of Iustifi|cation,
the other as an effect in them
iustified. It were easie to bee large
in numbring authorities, and in re|porting
such distinctions and shifts, as
the deceyued vse in supporting their
opinions: they are but inuentions,
and therefore without respect, I
passe them ouer:<NOTE PLACE="marg">No vertue, no truth in extremity.</NOTE> but aduise my
Christian Reader to beware of both
extremities, and modestly and mo|derately
to vnderstand the meanes of
his Iustification, that his zeale carry
him to no extremity, but to the
vertuous meane onely; not to ascribe
all to faith and nought to Workes,
but to giue them both theyr necessa|ry
respects. For as wee are not iusti|fied
but by Faith, so our Faith is
<PB N="238" REF="130">
not iustified but by workes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">We are iu|stified by faith, our faith by workes.</NOTE> For if our
workes bee not faithfull, and our faith
working, we are not iustified, neyther
can bee saued. And thus may the see|ming

<HI>Iames</HI> be reconciled;<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Paul, S. Iames.</NOTE> faith doth iustifie
vs before God, but such a faith as Saint

First, his original or first being. Second|ly,
his powerful &amp; general continuance.
Thirdly, his end, or the death of Death.
The originall cause that gaue Death
life, was sinne:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sinne the cause of death.</NOTE> and therefore when as
<HI>Adam</HI> had eaten the forbidden fruit, &amp;
thereby committed sin, then had death
his first beginning. For though <HI>Adam</HI>
did not at the instant of the act dye, yet
at the very instant of the sinne, was hee
made mortall &amp; subiect to the power of
death:<NOTE PLACE="marg">When A|dam was made mortal Gen. 1. 16. 17.</NOTE> for so God foretold him, that
<HI>whensoeuer hee did eate, he should dye;</HI> and
from this badde beginning was Death
first deriued.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 King: 17. 18:</NOTE> So the woma~ of <HI>Sarephath</HI>
could acknowledge that her sin was the
cause of her childes death: &amp; so haue all
the Children of GOD vnderstood of
death, and of the cause thereof. And S.
<HI>Paul</HI> calleth <HI>Death the wages of sinne:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 6. 16.</NOTE> as
if it were a necessary care in the iustice
of God, that al that haue committed sin
should haue the recompence &amp; wages
thereof, Death.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="135">Now the cause of this cause of death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cause of sinne.</NOTE>
was the Diuell, who enuying the pro|sperity
of our nature, suggested his te~p|tations
to our first parents, by whose
disobedience wee are all made mor|tal.
So sayth <HI>Salomon:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wisd. 2. 24.</NOTE> <HI>Through enuy of the
Diuell came de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">th into the world, and they
that hold of his side, proue it.</HI></P>
<P>And from these two Parentes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The two parents of death.</NOTE> the
Diuell and sinne, was death deriued,
from whom hee had his being and be|ginning.</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Secondly:</NOTE> wee must consider death
in the passage of his life. or in his
powerfull continuance: That is eui|dent
in this respect, that Death hath
a generall power ouer all flesh, the
which he doth execute vpon all, with|out
respect had either to the greatnesse
or goodnesse of any, And therfore is
Death called <HI>the way of all the Worlde,
and the way to our Fathers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen: 15. 15</NOTE> because as
our Fathers are gone the way of death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioshua, 23&punc; 14.</NOTE>
so must wee after them; and our po|sterity
after vs, for euer. For though
death bee but one, and his office the
cutting off the liues of all the World;
<PB N="250" REF="136">
yet it is but an easie performance, ha|uing
the diseases of our flesh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The power of death,</NOTE> and infi|nite
other occasions to attend him
in his deadly office. His power then
is generall ouer all, being limited by
GOD and time onely; who though
hee bring all flesh to corruption, yet
no flesh can corrupt him, or procure
fauour in the strict execution of his
office.</P>
<P>The ende,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thirdly,</NOTE> or the death of Death,
is the liuing righteousnesse of Iesus
Christ, which hee wrought by his
owne death, in his owne person. And
therfore saith the Prophet <HI>Hosea,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hos. 13. 14.</NOTE> <HI>Death
is swallowed vp in victory.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor, 15. 25.</NOTE> And S. <HI>Paul</HI>
sayth: that <HI>Christ Iesus must raigne till
hee hath put all his enemies vnder his feet,
and that the last enemy that shall bee de|stroyed
is death.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ver. 26.</NOTE> Therefore that Apostle
insulteth ouer death: <HI>O death</HI> (sayth he)
<HI>where is thy sting? O graue, where is thy
victory?</HI> Vers. 55.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Verse 55,</NOTE> <HI>The sting of death is sin,

<HI>But thankes bee vnto God who hath giuen
vs victory through our Lord Iesus Christ.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Verse 57.</NOTE>
Wherefore it is euident that God by
<PB N="251" REF="136">
his Sonne Christ, hath giuen man vi|ctory
ouer sinne and death.<NOTE PLACE="marg">By whome wee haue victory o|uer death.</NOTE> And
whereas before wee were all the ser|uants
of sinne, and the slaues of death,
wee are now made conquerours, that
were slaues; and despise them that
did commaund vs. This happy alte|ration
dooth reach benefite to all the
faithfull, but not to all men: therfore
is it limited and doth reach to such
particulars onely, as are in Gods elec|tion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The diffe|rence God vseth in the giuing of his giftes</NOTE>
For though God cast the beams
of his Sunne vpon euery mans face a|like,
and distributes&punc; his temporall
blessings (scatteringly as it were) with|out
any heedfull respect, where they
fall; yet those fauours that are eter|nall,
and import a perpetuity of hap|pinesse,
hee giueth them to his be|loued
elect onely, barring all the re|probate
from spirituall and eternall
grace.<NOTE PLACE="marg">In what respect death is not destroyed, hut made immortall</NOTE> And, therefore though the
death of Christ hath disarmed death &amp;
blunted his weapons that haue woun|ded
holy men: yet are those weapons
still sharpe, and that Death still liuing,
and made immortall against them
<PB N="252" REF="137">
that haue not receyued the image of

enter their graues, as their houses of

sayth the wise man:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccle. 41. 1. 2.</NOTE> <HI>The remembra~ce
of death is very bitter to some, and accep|table

day of feare.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death is the day of hope and of feare.</NOTE> Death then in these di|uers

hath a sting, and wants it; is deade, yet
liuing and by opening the gate of tem|porary

eyther of eternall life, or eternall death:

as this life we breath is but a sacrament

<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<HEAD>The generall vse.</HEAD>
<P>First, seeing death was begotten by

such power as to bee their own meanes
in the cause of their saluation, fondly, &amp;
falsely thinking, that their eyes of Na|ture
are not blinde in spirituall iudge|ment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The eyes of nature are blinde in spirituall iudgement.</NOTE>
but imagine to haue that vertue

then can be had of our ability, who
are in all respects (but sin) <HI>Adams</HI> farre
inferiour, and (by much) lesse able in the
performance of any spirituall duty?</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Secondly.</NOTE> seeing death hath vniuer|sall
power ouer all flesh, and seeing
there is no partiality in his executions,

<P>Lastly, seeing death is a repose, and

sweeten the sorrowes of this life, with

they are obedient,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Insensible things. o|bedient to nature.</NOTE> wherby they glorifie
God in finishing the end of their crea|tion.
God hath co~manded the motion
of the heaue~s, the influe~ce of the starres
the natures of the elements, &amp; the seue|rall
natures of euery seuerall thing. All
these continuing their course &amp; nature,
giue moste notable demonstrations of
Gods glorie, by whom they were crea|ted,
&amp; thus disposed in nature. If these
things which are subiect to time, and
must perish, doe notwithstanding dis|charge
the duties of their nature, and so
by consequence approue themselues to
be instruments of Gods glory: shal men
who~ God hath created for the like ende
of his glorie, &amp; to whom he hath giuen
a soule of excelle~t vnderstanding, &amp; for
whom he hath created the World, the
most admirable worke of his own ha~ds,
shall these bee carelesse in this high du|tie?
and shall the Elements &amp; vnreaso|nable
<PB N="267" REF="144">
creatures be carefull? Shall me~ be
exceeded by beasts, in the execution of
their most reasonable seruice? God hath
not threatned theyr neglect with Hell,
nor promised to reward their diligence
with Heauen.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Men lesse carefull then beasts</NOTE> God doth both promise
&amp; threaten men, yet are men lesse care|full
then Beasts. This may worthilie
remember those men, (or rather those
beasts) who make a God of themselues,
or of their vnlawfull pleasures: &amp; then
dedicate themselues, their labours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To what end men&punc; co~monly de|dicate their trauell.</NOTE> and
the glorie of all their actions, to a pro|phane
and licencious trade of life.</P>
<P>These that will not doe it of choyce,
must doe it by force: For the time will
come when God will whip these slaues
with the rods of his iudgeme~ts, &amp; make
them (in despite of their vngodlines) to
glorifie God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The wou~ds of hell and conscience.</NOTE> in suffering the torments
of hell and their conscience: and (with|out
profit) to acknowledge God, &amp; the
terrible iustice of so great a Maiestie.</P>
<P>This may also reme~ber the children of
God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Secondly.</NOTE> that in all the cares of their Chri|stia~
life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gods glorie the maine of all our cares</NOTE> they haue their main respect to
Gods glory, &amp; that God may haue place
in theyr heartes, euen before the desire
<PB N="268" REF="145">
of their own saluation: &amp; that their sal|uation
be desired, rather that God may
be glorified, then to desire to glorifie
God for their owne saluation:<NOTE PLACE="marg">We must prefer it be fore our owne salua|tion.</NOTE> that so
God may bee the first in all our cares,
that we loue him, more then our owne
soules, and prefer his honor, before our
own saluation. For he that will not des|pise
himself (in respect of Gods honor)
doth but disse~ble his loue, neither doth
willingly glorifie God; for thogh God
bee in his eyes, hee hath himselfe in his
heart,<NOTE PLACE="marg">We must despise our owne selues for the loue of God.</NOTE> and though hee pretend to loue
God, it is for his owne priuate end, not
that God may be glorified. And thus to
glorifie God is to dishonor him, and so
to prouoke his indignation against vs.</P>
<P>Therfore let all men loue God for his
owne sake; loue him for his truth, loue
him for his mercie, loue him for his iu|s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ce;<NOTE PLACE="marg">We must loue God for his own sake.</NOTE>
&amp; let this loue be so respectles of

so much as the reuerence &amp; zealous af|fection
we haue to the loue of God;<NOTE PLACE="marg">To loue God, is to glorify him.</NOTE> for

<P>I will therfore discharge the shame of
all my actions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Speciall application.</NOTE> into this ocean of Gods
glory. I will propose, &amp; persue that end
onely, I will not respect the vain purpo|ses
of men:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The vaine purposes of men.</NOTE> I wil remember that they are
transitory, &amp; will leaue me, flatterers &amp;
will deceyue me. I wil reduce to memo|ry

fortunate in earthly prosperities, when
I examine their worth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The transi|tory estate of worldly states.</NOTE> I shall finde no|thing
but names, &amp; those neglected by
the power of time, themselues, and their
regards are vanished, all those thinges
perish, &amp; are disgraced with the vse of
time; because their actions ran not this
holy race of Gods glory, but had diuers
&amp; disagreeing ends.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The power of death o|uer the world.</NOTE> Death hath depri|ued

I will then with all possible endeuour,
