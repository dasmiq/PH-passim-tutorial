<L>GAllants, I vow I am quite out of heart,</L>
<L>I've not one smutty Iest in all my part.</L>
<L>Here's not one Scene of tickling Rallery;</L>
<L>There we quite lose the Pit and Gallery,</L>
<L>His <HI>London Cuckolds</HI> did afford you sport.</L>
<L>That pleas'd the Town, and did divert the Court.</L>
<L>But 'cause some squeamish Females of renown</L>
<L>Made visits with design to cry it down,</L>
<L>He swore in's Rage he would their humors fit,</L>
<L>And write the next without one word of Wit.</L>
<L>No Line in this will tempt your minds to Evil,</L>
<L>It's true, 'tis dull, but then 'tis very civil.</L>
<L>No double sense shall now your thoughts beguile,</L>
<L>Make Lady Blush, nor Ogling Gallant Smile.</L>
<L>But mark the Fate of this mis-judging Fool!</L>
<L>A Bawdy Play was never counted Dull,</L>
<L>Nor modest Comedy e're pleas'd you much,</L>
<L>'Tis relish'd like good Manners 'mongst the <HI>Dutch.</HI></L>
<L>In you, Chast Ladies, then we hope to day,</L>
<L>This is the Poets <HI>Recantation</HI> Play</L>
<L>Come often to't that he at length may see</L>
<L>'Tis more than a pretended Modesty</L>
<L>Stick by him now, for if he finds you falter,</L>
<L>He quickly will his way of writing alter;</L>
<L>And every Play shall send you blushing home,</L>
<L>For, tho you rail, yet then we're sure you'll come,</L>
<L>Thus Brides are Coy and Bashful the first night,</L>
<L>But us'd to't once, are mad for their delight.</L>
<L>Do not the <HI>Whiggish</HI> Nature then pursue,</L>
<L>Lest like <HI>Whig-Writer,</HI> he desert you too.</L>
<L><HI>Whig-Poet</HI> when he can no longer Thrive,</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Decoy.</SPEAKER>
<P>'TWas Prudently done of you Yesterday (when Mr. <HI>Gerrald</HI> came to know what was become of his Pistols) to send down word you was gone into the City, by that I gain'd time to get 'em Painted, as also the Table in the Closet, where they are to be found.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dame.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's well done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Decoy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have got the Picture of Mr. <HI>Vallentine</HI> that has the Pistols, who took 'em away only because he believ'd the other party would not fail coming to you to know how they were lost; and the Jest is, he thinks he stole 'em-so cunning|ly, that if you discover the Theft, he will think you the greatest Sorceress in the world: and this my Care and Diligence has found out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dame.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Mr. <HI>Decoy,</HI> It shall not be out of your way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Decoy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I spoke not as to that, 'tis sufficient we understand one another; the multitudes of Fools who daily flock to you, cry you up on all sides.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dame.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's not one but this Mr. <HI>Gerrald</HI> that speaks against me, and he rails at me where e're he comes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Decoy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Though you are no Sorceress, yet you have the wit to make the World think so, and that's the same thing as if you really were one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dame.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am much beholden to <HI>Beatrice</HI> for't; well, she's an admirable Wench to draw Fools into the Net, she affects an innocent, simple carriage, which makes 'em believe twenty silly Stories.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Decoy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I always said <HI>Beatrice</HI> was a Treasure; but pray how goes the Business of the Marriage which the jealous Lady wou'd so sain prevent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dame.</SPEAKER>
<P>The misfortunes which I foretold to the Countess (who has been my Client a great while) have disheartned her enough already; she is to come again to know the effects of a pretended Consultation that I am to have with a Spirit which I make her believe is my Intelligence, and acquaints me with every
<PB N="2" REF="4">
thing, and in this Business I have a double advantage, for she not only pays me for this, but the Lady <HI>Noble,</HI> who secretly loves the Colonel, fees me to hinder the Marriage by virtue of my Art.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Decoy.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are not the only Person that takes Bribes on both sides.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dame.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you got those Paintings here that are for carrying on the business of the Pistols we talkt of?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Decoy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let Mr. <HI>Gerrald</HI> come when he will, every thing is in readiness as I told you; nor have I been wanting in my Endeavours to procure you another Carcass, I have been with the Executioner, and he has promis'd me another dead Body fresh from the Gallows, he'll send it you as soon as Execution is over; that trick once more will make you famous as long as you live.</P>
</SP>

<P>I'll study a fit occasion to imploy it to my best advantage. Be gone.</P>

<P>WHat News Mrs. <HI>Hellen?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah Dame <HI>Dobson,</HI> I am almost out of breath, I slipt out at our back door, and came running to acquaint you, that the Countess is in|stantly coming to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dame.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let her come, I am prepar'd what to say, being such a Credulous per|son as I know she is; let her Marry him after that if she dare.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but you don't know that the Collonel whom she'd be well enough pleas'd with for a Husband, comes along with her in disguise of her Footman, whom she has promis'd to make happy, if he can any wayes convince her, that what you do is all but a Cheat; and he has disguis'd himself to try if you or any of your Devils are Cunning enough to discover him; therefore be upon your guard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dame.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad to hear this, for it saves me a great deal of trouble, and in the hurry of business I might not have taken the pains to have found it out. But does not the Countess think you suspect our Correspondence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hel.</SPEAKER>
<P>How shou'd she? I am always speaking against you to her; I say daily to her, that 'tis by meer chance if you tell any thing true, and to convince me of my error, she runs o're all the particular remarkable things of her life, which she pretends you have given her an account of; but little thinks she all this while that 'tis from me you know 'em.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dame.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cou'd with long study. But because this business is in haste, and requires all our diligence, 'tis the more ready way to know all by your Intelli|gence, and cuts out work short.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hell.</SPEAKER>
<P>O well thought on too, I had like to have forgot to tell you, that af|ter she has convers'd with you bare-fac'd, she will presently come again in a Mask; and I am to be with her in a Mask too. I'll point at you with my

finger, or make some other sign by which you shall know us: Besure fail not, but tell the same misfortunes as formerly.</P>

<P>Is any one with her?</P>

<P>No, an please your Honour; but she has lock'd her self up in her black Garret, taken her great Book, and call'd for a glass of Water, I suppose she is at work for your Honour.</P>

<P>I'le expect then, Pray when she comes forth, let me be the first that speaks with her.</P>

<STAGE>Ex. <HI>Beat.</HI></STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Count.</SPEAKER>
<P>I vow and protest Collonel, I am very much troubled to see you in this dress; if any one shou'd come and know you, what would they say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no danger of that, I came in a Chair, I run no hazard of being known, but you might have saved the trouble of this disguise if you wou'd have given less Credit to this Canting she-Fortune-teller, who invents a company of idle stories only to get your Money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Count.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will have it then that Fortune-tellers are Cheats.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis their Profession, they can tell nothing, and only work upon the Credulity of People they meet with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Count.</SPEAKER>
<P>But examine the Case a little, what reason can this Woman have think you, to hinder my marrying of you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not, unless I have some secret Rival that wou'd supplant me&punc; And I cannot imagine how your Woman Mrs. <HI>Hellen,</HI> shou'd be more quick of apprehension than your Honour; She tells you daily you converse with an Ig|norant prating Woman, one, that if you believe, the world will censure you for your easiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Count.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Hellen</HI>'s a Fool, and has no reason to say so; for after those Truths this Woman has told me, so often I ought to Credit her; Do not therefore persist in perswading me to render my self unhappy by Marriage that wou'd prove so disastrous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><PB N="4" REF="5">Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>The misfortune that will make us both unhappy, is, that you will believe her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Count.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have heard my Reasons, and you see I take all care possible tho|rowly to inform my self for your sake, and endeavour more particularly to know what sort of Mischiefs they are that wou'd ensue such an Engagement, and if it be a fatality that cannot be avoided, my resolution depends on what she shall now say; and all this I have done that you may no longer have a pretence to say that what she does, is all but Artifice and Cheat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt not but we shall presently know the truth of that to both our satisfactions. Besure to question her about me, I am certain her Devil can in|form her nothing of my disguise. And as to Mr. <HI>Gerrald</HI> that came to you last Night, do you think she will tell him where to find his Pistols agen?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Count.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>He neither believes, nor hopes it himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Count.</SPEAKER>
<P>If she shou'd not tell him who took 'em, I shou'd not believe her a Cheat, for that she is not oblig'd to know every thing; It suffices me that she never tells any thing but what is true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I submit Madam, I now begin to be convinc'd, that she has some Witch|craft in her; for certainly if she had not set a spell upon you, you cou'd never be so zealous in her Justification; for my part, I know not what can be done more to undeceive you.</P>

<P>He is not in the least inclin'd to Jealousie.</P>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>I'le not marry him, that's for certain; but pray tell me, can you re|solve me one thing, I wou'd fain know what that Party is now a doing.</P>

<P>Nay, I am like my Father for that, I know both when, where, how and what, as occasion shall serve. But as to my Mistress, I wou'd fain have mar|ried her&mdash;I need not tell you that neither&mdash;But since she has been acquainted with a certain sort of People that are come from <HI>Tangier</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> who talk of nothing but Campaigns, Sieges and Battles, wou'd you believe it; she's in a manner asham'd of my Company, and they nothing but make Sport and laugh and jeer her out of conceit with me; and&mdash;now and then I have a devilish mind to be at some of them; But because I have never been in the Army, nor us'd to Fighting, I let 'em alone for fear I shou'd be beaten; and for that reason I hold my Tongue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dame.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have a great deal of Prudence upon my word: But why don't you pass a Campaign in the Wars, that wou'd teach you to be as brisk and as brave as the best of 'em. You only want being flesht.</P>

and when I have come home, I have shot off my Musquet in the Street that I have made the very Houses shake agen&mdash;when&mdash;I am naturally inclin'd to the Wars, and there is scarce a Night passes but I dream of fighting and killing, and never am alone in the dark, but am throwing my Arms about, and striking as if I was beating of this man, and that man, and t'other man&mdash;</P>

<P>That demonstrates your Inclination, and it is a fair Prognostick.</P>

<SPEAKER>Gill.</SPEAKER>
<P>And t'other day being alone in my Chamber, arm'd Cap a-pee, as I came from Training, seeing my self in the Glass, methoughts I had such a Marshal Air, and look'd so like a Warrior, I was extreamly pleas'd, and cou'd not forbear Skirmishing against the great Raw-bon'd people in the Hangings, I made an Ass of <HI>Sampson</HI> with his Jaw-bone. And I find I cou'd be as sharp upon real persons, but that there's one little difficulty I can't o'recome.&mdash;</P>

<SP>

<P>What is that?</P>

<P>She has reason for't, but you know it requir'd time to deceive her Artificially: It was necessary to our purpose to make her put away her former Woman, and to take you in her place, and to continue it without letting her know that you were of our Acquaintance; It was requisite also to let her be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ccustomed to you, that she might put Confidence in you.

<P>I Recant my former opinion, I resolv'd to assist you in convincing the World that she was but a Cheat: But after what she has told me ought to be si|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">&punc; she has reveal'd such things, that 'tis impossible but she must deal with the Devil.</P>

<P>There 'tis now, she's too cunning for all you Women, in that consists her greatest Skill.</P>
</SP>

<P>Collonel, your Countess is a person highly deserving, and I shou&punc;d be very glad to see her Married to a Man of so much Worth and Bravery, and you know I have hither to blam'd her for desisting upon account of any thing this Woman had foretold. But now I find the Countess was much in the right for I am absolutely perswaded the Match will be very unfortunate.</P>

<SP>

<P>Such Predictions shou'd not hinder if the Countess wou'd but consent to Marry me.</P>

<SPEAKER>Nob.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is there no other Woman in the World you cou'd be content with for a Wife?&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I have too strong a Passion ever to leave her.</P>

<P>But you must dispense with things when there are such strong Reasons against you, endeavour to please your fancy in some other Beauty.</P>

<P>What will it avail me to love any other? for in her opinion the Change of the Person does not in the least alter the fate of my Marriage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nob.</SPEAKER>
<P>I Confess she has much puzled me too, she told me I shou'd very sud|dainly be a Widow, but that is no wonderful thing, for my Husband is very old and sickly; and though his Death wou'd be a great grief to me, yet there is some reason for't: For according to the course of Nature, I shou'd outlive him. But that which I don't understand is this, she assures me I will Marry agen, now I don't find in my self the least inclination to a second Hus|band&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coll.</SPEAKER>
<P>By that, you see there's no Credit to be given to what she sayes; for if you never marry agen, what becomes of her Prediction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nob.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but she maintains that I will, and that what she tells me will cer|tainly happen. She assures me moreover, that I shall make him I marry the hap|piest man living.</P>

<P>I verily believe it Madam, for a man cannot but be happy with a Lady of such Beauty and Perfections.

<P>How shou'd I have such a fancy in my Head, I have not a quarter of the Money by me to pay for 'em. And yet I have seen a man that your figure exactly resembles, often standing in a Goldsmith's Shop as I have pass'd by in a Coach, and have taken great notice of him.</P>

<P>Yes, a pretended Heiress. They thought to deceive me with a Story of her being stolen away and Marry'd.</P>

<P>What cou'd be more strange than the Discovery of that? 'Twas the Countess&mdash;to whom the Collonel layes such a close Siege! She is absolutely resolv'd never to have any farther Correspondence with him: And for proof of't. I am to call on her some time to Day to wait on her hither.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dame.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gerr.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am a man that love my Pleasure; I hate delays and laying Siege to Women: who sometimes wanting a little Inclination to betray 'em within, will hold out longer than fortify'd Towns. Now I am for a brisk assault, Taking, Sacking and Plundering them all in a Minute: wherefore I would purchace a Secret of you, that might make all Women that I have a mind to, to fall in love with me at first sight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dame.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand you&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gerr.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am by Nature very inconstant, but do not think the worse of me for't, 'tis the only way to be happy; for if we consider the thing right, what can be more miserable than a constant Lover.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dame.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most men are of your mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gerr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fully to enjoy the sweets of love, we must love all that are Fair and
<PB N="43" REF="24">
Beautiful: The tall, the short, the lean, the plump, the fair, the black, the brisk, airy, wild and the sober phlegmatick demure Lady: They have all some different Charm, and something peculiarly pleasant and diverting in their way of loving, which others have not; and therefore a Lover cannot be completely happy that confines himself to any one, or indeed to less than all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dame.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are one of an extraordinary Gusto.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gerr.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am experienc'd, and know Women: There is a sort of 'em that are proud, haughty, and imperious, who think it a scorn that any man in the World shou'd say he has had the advantage of 'em. There are others of a cold Con|stitution by Nature, and insensible: Some that nothing can change, when once they have plac'd their Affections. And as this sort are very pleasant and de|lightful to a man, whil'st his appetite serves; so are they a most troublesome sort of Cattle, when a Lover begins to retreat: They are Killing, Stabbing, and Poisoning: Others there are that have a natural Aversion both to Love and to Mankind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dame.</SPEAKER>
<P>Those sure are Monsters in Nature!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gerr.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are dough-bak'd Women; there wanted heat at their Genera|tion: And there's as great a difference betwixt them and other Women, as in the Chickens that are hatch'd by the heat of an Oven, and those under a Hen!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dame.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is a great difference indeed: But now as to your Business! I won't say 'tis above my Power; but as I cannot absolutely effect it without the utmost severity of Art, and the most rigorous of my Conjurations, to assemble the Spirits that are most stubborn and difficult to obey; so it cannot be done in a day; and you will not in less than six Months perceive that I have compass'd for you what you desire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gerr.</SPEAKER>
<P>But will you assure me that in Six Months or such a time, I shall have power over all Women that please my fancy?</P>

<P>I understand you: There are 40 Guinneys for the present, I was just going to offer it you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dame.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay,&mdash;I ask not any for my self; I'le freely bestow my pains, but this is for an Ingredient; my Spirits shall go to work upon these, and have time enough to talk before the six Months are expir'd.</P>

<P>I wou'd willingly have contriv'd to have done you the Kindness with|out putting you to the Expence, but that it was impossible to be done without an Extract of Gold; which truly prepar'd and rightly administred, will have a strange Dominion over the Spirits of Women.

And that it wou'd be enough to hear it fall! That done, I had the string ready which I had prepar'd with a running knot, and as I came to Bed in the dark from the Chimney, where I put out the light, I stept and put it o're the Neck of the Jarr; and unwound the bottom all along, as I crept to the Bed side.&mdash;I was no sooner lay'd, but my Lady crept close to me, and clasp'd her Arm

<P>She was here yesterday to consult Dame <HI>Dobson</HI> in matters relating to you; and as she herself affirms, Dame <HI>Dobson</HI> show'd her you in a Glass kissing her Picture.</P>

<P>Perhaps you only tell me this to laugh at me, or try my Confidence in this Woman, because you find me here: But 'tis very true that in my Solitude I was musing on my Window, and kissing her Picture just when the Messenger <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> me the Letter.</P>

<P>I have alter'd my mind, since you have told me she has bin here, and and in two or three days I shall be resolv'd in my scruples, if the Widow keeps her word: And I think I need not doubt it after those assurances which she has given me since my coming to Town.</P>

And this is it for which I sent for you, and other Friends to be in readi|ness; in whose presence I mean to uncase her Devil, that you may be Witnesses of the Cheat, and help to divulge it, that the Town may no longer be impos'd on.</P>
