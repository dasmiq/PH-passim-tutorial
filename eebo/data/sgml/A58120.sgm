<HEAD>Prologue.</HEAD>
<L>VEry unfortunate this Play has bin;</L>
<L> A slippery trick was play'd as by <HI>Scapin.</HI></L>
<L> Whilst here our Actors made along delay,</L>
<L> When some were idle, others ran away,</L>
<L> The City House comes out with half our Play.</L>
<L> We fear, that having heard of this so long,</L>
<L> Your expectation now will do it wrong.</L>
<L> The Poet does a dang'rous trial make,</L>
<L> And all the common Roads of Plays forsake.</L>
<L> Vpon the Actors it depends too much,</L>
<L> And who can hope ever to see two such</L>
<L> As the Fam'd <HI>Harlequin &amp; Scaramouch.</HI></L>
<L> This well he knew.&mdash;</L>
<L>Yet rather chose in new attempts to fail,</L>
<L> Than in the old indifferently prevail.</L>
<L> Great Wits refrain this writing, 'cause 'tis low,</L>
<L> They oftner write to please themselves than you.</L>
<L> Like but the Play, let others have the name,</L>
<L> Let both <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italians</HI> share the fame,</L>
<L> But if't be bad, let them too bear the blame.</L>

<P>Singing and Dancing I understand well enough. But Signior <HI>Alonge,</HI> I don't Comprehend the Mistery of your Vocation, what need is there of killing a Man by Rule?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fence.</SPEAKER>
<P>The art of Fencing consists in two things, to give and not to receive that is, to ofsend, and defend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harl.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is to run a Man through, and not be run through, which is to kill and not be killed, ha-</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fenc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, and 'tis impossible you shou'd receive, if you know how to turn the Sword of your Enemy from the line of your Bo|dy. And this depends only on the Motion of the wrist, As&mdash;&mdash;in thus, and out&mdash;thus.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harl.</SPEAKER>
<P>A man then whether he be valiant or not, If he has but this art, is sure to kill a Man and not be hanged for it.</P>

<P>Come behind him and Shoot him, or kill him pissing a|gainst a Wall, Demonstration, a sure way to kill and not be kill'd,</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wherefore are you thus transported with rage? Have you not learn't Moral Philosophy? which teacheth the Govern|ment of our Passions. Have you never read the Learned Treatise <HI>Seneca</HI> compos'd of Choller. Ought not reason to be Masters of our Passions?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Danc.</SPEAKER>
<P>But Signior <HI>Scaramouch,</HI> he had the impudence t'af|front us, and speak contemptously of our Professions, and under|value singing and dancing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><PB N="4" REF="5">Scar.</SPEAKER>
<P>A wise man is above injuries, and the best return to af|fronts is Moderation and Patience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fence.</SPEAKER>
<P>They had both of 'em the Impudence to compare their two Professions of singing and dancing to the Noble Sci|ence of defence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scar.</SPEAKER>
<P>And ought you to be concern'd at this? is this sufficient to cause such irregular emotions, it is vain Glory to make com|parisons, Wisdom and Virtue only give distinction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sing.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is nothing so profitable to the Publique as Mu|sick.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Danc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor nothing so necessary to Mankind as dancing</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>All the disorders, all the Wars which have been in the World have happen'd, for not having learn'd Musick.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Danc.</SPEAKER>
<P>All the misfortunes of Mankind, all the lamentable Stories which we read of in History, the disapointments of Coun|cils, the failuers of great Generals, and defeats of Armies have bin thro' want of Dancing.</P>

<P>How so?</P>

<P>Does not War proceed from the want of Union among men?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scar.</SPEAKER>
<P>True.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sing.</SPEAKER>
<P>And if all men wou'd learn Musick, wou'd not they ac|cord better with one another? And wou'd not there be an uni|versal peace and quietness in the World? Peace is when all men agree in a Harmonious Concurrence, Peace and Concord are the same thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh!&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Danc.</SPEAKER>
<P>When a man fails in his conduct, whether it be in respect to the affairs of his&mdash;Family, or the Government of the Kingdom, or in the Command of an Army, is it not always said of such a man he did not go well about his business; he did not take the right time? And so,&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Oh!&mdash;&punc;</P>

<P>And how shou'd a man go well, or do any thing in time, that can't Dance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fenc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, Ha, Ha.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Danc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here now you see the profitableness of Dancing, and Musick, Dancing is therefore a Science absolutely necessary to mankind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><PB N="5" REF="5">Sing.</SPEAKER>
<P>And Musick is a Science without which the World can|not subsist.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fenc.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how will you Govern without the Sword? And where are your Generals and Armies without men that under|stand their Weapons? Therefore I maintain against them both, that the Science of Desence is the noblest and most necessary of all Sciences whatever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>A Son to marry without the consent of his Father.</P>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>Yes truly you have so, I was angry my self when I first heard on't, I was so much concern'd for your sake, that I school'd your Son soundly, ask him there what a Lecture I read him for his want of respect to a Father, to whose least commands he ought to show obedience, no man cou'd have said more, not your self. But I have since considered things according to Reason, and find (now my Passion is gone) that they are not so bad as may be imagin'd,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Panc.</SPEAKER>
<P>How? What can be worse, then for a Son to run head|long, and Marry no body knows who?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plaut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, I grant it was not well done, but what? our Acti|ons depend not altogether on us, the Stars have a powerful in|fluence. In sine, it was his Fate.</P>
</SP>

<P>That's a fine Reason indeed, by that means a man may Cheat, Rob, Murder, and say for excuse, 'Twas his Fate so to do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plaut.</SPEAKER>
<P>But Sir, you take my words in too strict a Philosophi|cal a sense, yet Fate is hard to be resisted, and the influence of the Stars, concur much to the Operations of our Minds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Panc.</SPEAKER>
<P>But does not wisdom controul the Stars, and the Fate you: talk of? <HI>Sapiens Dominabitur Astris</HI>&mdash;</P>

<P>'Tis confest, but I had still a regard to my self, I never did what he has done.</P>
</SP>

<P>And what has he done? He saw a young Lady whom he loved, he had that from you to have a kindness for all pret|ty Women. He found her very charming, made her visits, look'd languishingly on her, sigh'd and talk'd passionately, and declared his love in all the gallantries of Courtship. She makes a return, he is weak, the temptation strong, his Stars conspire, Fate helps, Opportunity presents, he makes use of the Critical minute, the Parents surprise him, force him to marry her, he gives her his Hand, and makes the best of a bad Market, and yet you'l be an|gry.</P>

<P>Ah Signior <HI>Plautino,</HI> I meet you very luckily, I was just coming to find you.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plaut.</SPEAKER>
<P>For what Signior <HI>Spittzaferro?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>To ask your advice about a business I have in hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plaut.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm very glad I meet you, here we may discourse with freedom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be cover'd I beseech you, 'tis concerning a matter of great importance, but it is not good to proceed in matters of this nature without the counsel and advice of Friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plaut.</SPEAKER>
<P>I take it as a particular honour, Signior <HI>Spittzaferro,</HI> that you make choice of me. Well Sir, acquaint me with the busi|ness.</P>

<SPEAKER>Plaut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, since you desire it, I will.</P>

<P>You are in the right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>In this Age 'tis very hard to find a sincere friend.</P>

<P>For you to marry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I my self in Person, what wou'd you counsel me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><PB N="18" REF="12">Plaut.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you plainly, that 'twill be very indiscreetly done of you to marry, for marriage is a thing that even young people ought to consider of before they do it, and if marriage at the best be counted the greatest of follies, what can be worse than to be guilty of this folly, at an Age when we shou'd be more discreet. In short Sir, I tell you my opinion, I wou'd not counsel you to marry, and you'l be thought the indiscreetest man in the world, having liv'd free to these years, if you shou'd now thrust your neck into the yoak.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I tell you Signior <HI>Plautino,</HI> that I'm resolv'd to marry, come what will, and that no body will count me a fool for marrying the Gentlewoman I pretend to, when once they see what manner of person she is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plaut.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! that alters the Case, you did not tell me that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>She's one that's very pritty, and one that I love very well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plaut.</SPEAKER>
<P>You love her very well?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart, and I have her Fathers consent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plaut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, you have her Fathers consent too?</P>

<P>Yes, and I have promis'd to be marri'd to morrow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plaut.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Marry, Marry, I have no more to say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was formerly against marrying, but now I consider if I continue as I am, the race of the <HI>Spittzaferro</HI>'s will be at an end, and in marrying I shall live after I am dead, in my issue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plaut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Therefore you'l do very well to marry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, what a pleasure I shall take to see a Company of little Creatures, to whom I gave life and motion, and are so ma|ny small Figures of my self, there shall I see my self drawn to the life in little. O how these little images will be hopping and jumping about me, and calling me Pa pa, talking and prattling, and telling me a company of pritty little foolish tales, O the dear pritty little Poppets, what can be more delightful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Nothing in the world, therefore marry the first thing you do.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aur.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most extremely glad, I'll assure you: For to say truth, my Father's severity has kept me in a most intollerable subjecti|on, I have been almost mad for a little more liberty, and especially e're since he was sick. He has kept me so mew'd up in his warm Chamber, that I have wanted room to breath in. Were it not for you, that I must go abroad to buy things for our Wedding, I shou'd never have stirr'd from him: Ah! the fresh Air is so comfortable to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;And the sight of me,&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aur.</SPEAKER>
<P>Above all,&mdash;I have wish'd a thousand times that he would marry me to somebody, that I might get out of his Juris|diction, and be a little more at my own disposal; and you, I thank you, are come most luckily to do me that good turn.</P>

<P>Eumh; no, no.</P>
</SP>

<P>As for my part, I think there ought to be a mutual compliance, and that people ought not to marry to be trouble|some to one another. In fine, when we are married we'l live like two that understand one anothers humour; no jealousy nor suspitious shall trouble your head, but it shall be sufficient that you have an assurance of my fidelity; as I shall have a good opi|nion of yours. But what troubles you, I perceive your coun|tenance much chang'd on the sudden?</P>

<P>That the education of children&mdash;</P>

<P>Signior, no, that&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Panc.</SPEAKER>
<P>That it is better to bestow it upon a Son than an Estate, because Wealth respects only the body, and may be taken from us; but we cannot be depriv'd of our virtues, which are the riches of the mind, because more permanent, and of greater importance.</P>

<SPEAKER>Scar.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, that&mdash;</P>

<P>It gives me no small trouble.</P>

<P>Life is full of changes; it is good always to be pre|par'd for the worst.</P>

<P>I cou'd ha' born any thing but this.</P>

<P>Every one can bear the evils which might have hap|ned; but 'tis the part of a Philosopher to master his Temper, and command his Passions in the evils which do happen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Panc.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'l tell you, Mr. <HI>Plautino,</HI> nothing but this cou'd have mov'd me:&mdash;This is a thing;&mdash;Well, I'm just going to Coun|sel about it, to know how to remedy it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plaut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray hearken to me, Signior <HI>Pancrace;</HI> try some other way to adjust the business, you are not ignorant that Law re|quires much sawce, and you will hang your self upon dangerous Tenters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Panc.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are in the right; but pray what is that other way?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plaut.</SPEAKER>
<P>I went and found out the Brother of this young Wo|man your Son has marri'd; he is by profession a <HI>Bravo,</HI> one that lives by cutting of throats; he never speaks without an Oath in's mouth, and makes no more scruple to kill a man, than to blow out the snuff of a Candle. I discours'd him upon the Marriage, and found him reasonably inclin'd to accommodate the business for a certain Sum of Money; and provided he may have it, he's contented to suffer a Divorce.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Panc.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is't he demands?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plaut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! 'tis very considerable.</P>

<P>But what?</P>

<P>Extravagant things.</P>

<P>Well, let me hear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plaut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing under 5 or 600 Pistols.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Panc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Five or 600 l evors and Quartan-Agues seize him! he does it to jeer us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plaut.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I told him I wou'd not give ear to such a Proposition, and said that you was not a man of that easy temper to be whistled out of your Money: After a long debate, the result
<PB N="42" REF="24">
was this;&mdash;I am, says he, in a short time, to go to the Army in <HI>Flanders;</HI> I must be well accoutred, and have need of Mo|ney, which makes me consent to what otherwise I shou'd not hearken to: I want a good serviceable Horse for the Wars, which will not cost less than threescore Pistols.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Panc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, threescore Pistols shall break no squares.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plaut.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall want too, says he, a Sword, Pistols, Scarf and Feather; which will cost at least thirty Pistols more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Thirty and threescore, make fourscore and ten.</P>
</SP>

<P>You must spend a world of Money in Law; you must give the Clerks Expedition-Money, pay for Writing, Drawing, Engrossing, Copying, Sealing, Endorsing, and all several Charges.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Panc.</SPEAKER>
<P>I maintain that a man ought to say the figure of a Hat, and not the form; yes, not <HI>forma,</HI> but <HI>figura;</HI> for there is this difference betwixt form and figure, that the form is the external disposition of animate Bodies; the figure is the external dispo|sitions of Bodies inanimate: It ought to be said, the figure of a Hat, and not the form.

<P>Signior <HI>Spittzaferro;</HI> pray alter your positive manner of speaking. Our Philosophy teaches us not to speak any de|cisive Proposition, but to discourse of every thing with uncer|tainty, to suspend always one judgment.

doubt not but she'l be happy in you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, she won't; I have sometimes strange melancholy Fits, and whilst they last, I am very extravagant; and I'm sure 'twill be too much for her to bear with me in those humours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cynt.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Sister is of a very good disposition, and as merry, she'l sing and laugh, and play a thousand tricks to divert you; she'l be the fittest Wife alive for you.</P>

</SP>

<P>Your reason?</P>

<HEAD>Epilogue.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THose that were Iudges forty years ago,</L>
<L>Would nothing but strict Comedy allow,</L>
<L>And humours drawn exactly to the life.</L>
<L>The Poet here, with nature is at strife.</L>
<L>We show'd to day only what's strange and new,</L>
<L>Where tho the Picture was not drawn so true,</L>
<L>Yet th'oddness of the piece may pleasure give,</L>
<L>As that alone makes the <HI>Dutch</HI> painting thrive.</L>
<L>We in this age, which is so much for change,</L>
<L>Have leapt the Hedg, and now with freedom range.</L>
<L>What's naturally witty will not do,</L>
<L>Unless there's something yet more strange than you.</L>
<L>If like your selves an airy Fop we show,</L>
<L>You cry, <HI>Dam-me Jack,</HI> that was stole from you.</L>
<L>No humor on the Stage will pass for Wit,</L>
<L>Cause ev'ry day you act your selves i'the Pit.</L>
<L>In Coffee-House but half the Fool y'expose,</L>
<L>With talk impertinent, and silly Oaths,</L>
<L>The <HI>Mall</HI> the Fop at full proportion shows.</L>
<L>To have you here then were dull Repetition,</L>
<L>'Twould be at least the fourth and worst Edition.</L>
<L>Nor can we now any new humor meet,</L>
<L>In all <HI>Cheap-side, Cornhill,</HI> and <HI>Lumbard-street,</HI></L>
<L>Upon the change, they're formal, dull, precise,</L>
<L>Of <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>French</HI> most gravely telling Lies;</L>
<L>Foretelling the success of Foreign War,</L>
<L>What may portend the <HI>Whale</HI> and <HI>Blazing-Star.</HI></L>
<L>Since they're so gravely dull, aud you so light,</L>
<L>Our Play we hope may've done you both some right.</L>
<L>Even in this Play will be some natural touches,</L>
<L>Whilst you're such <HI>Harlequins,</HI> they <HI>Scaramouches.</HI></L>
