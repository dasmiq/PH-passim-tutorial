<HEAD>To the Honour'd <HI>ALEXANDER POPHAM,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I reflect upon the vast Endow|ments, that inrich the Souls of Poets, and the unlimited Power of Poetry it self; how (by a Noble Conversation with the Immor|tal Labours of Antiquity) they turn the Glass of Time, and make it often run the Golden Age ag&eacute;n; Poetry, whose almost Creating Pow'r, out-strips the slower Race of Nature, to the forming, if possible, of Worlds unknown, and animating even Beings yet Unborn. And if Oblivion, the sole Death of Merit, shoots her ill-aim'd Arrows at the Memory of Vir|tuous and Noble Actions in vain; 'tis only, when they are guarded by such a Quill, whilst Deathless Worth stands transmitted to latest Ages by such Re|cording Hands.</P>
<P>When I consider this, I am obliged (so poor my weak pretensions) to renounce the Name of Poet, so far from being intituled to any legitimate Favours from
<PB REF="3">
any one of the Fair Inspirers, that I have rather com|mitted a barbarous Rape upon the whole Nine.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, when my too daring Confidence enboldens me, to lay this homely piece at your Feet; whatever I may hope from your own pardoning Good|ness, how will the World forgive me such a presump|tion? However, as self-preservation, my only Ex|cuse, has induced me to the Affixing so Great a Name to so worthless a Trifle, for borrowing the Umbrage of so Generous a Protectour: Believe me, Sir, that enter'd under your Honourable Roof, I survey such infinite Merits shine before me. But here let my Unhallow'd Pen advance no farther; 'tis enough my Veneration strikes me silent. And indeed such High Desert, is as much above the want of a Panegyrick, as I am unworthy the writing it. Not, Sir, that such conspicuous Virtues are unknown, but that I am known too much. The greatest justice therefore I can do your Memory, is to let your Name be men|tion'd, and let this Presumption tell Posterity, that nothing could awe a Player into Modesty.</P>
<P>But, Sir, to speak a word of this undeserving Off|spring that begs your Patronage. It is a common vanity amongst Dramatick Writers, to ascribe that Approbation which often is due alone to the Actors, to the Merit of their Pen, when one Man's Grimace
<PB REF="3">
shall sometimes betray an Audience into a general Applause; and thus no one can be sure he is inno|cent of Errors, till some Impartial Iudge has heard his Cause.</P>
<P>As the unexpected success of this Play does not add much, so neither does it take from its worth; there|fore it is as yet unsentenc'd, and tho' perhaps its Er|rors may condemn it, 'tis possible, a free Confession may gain half its Pardon: If your Goodness can forgive my Presumption in this Dedication, the World will pardon the Errors of the Play, since I send it abroad, under the Protection of so Honourable a Pa|tron. To whose Eternal Service, I Dedicate both This and my Self.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE: By Mr. <HI>Congreve.</HI></HEAD>
<BYLINE>Written for Mr. <HI>Hains,</HI> and spoken by him.</BYLINE>
<L>HEre's a young Fellow here&mdash;an Actor&mdash;<HI>Powel</HI></L>
<L>One whose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erson, perhaps, you all may know well,</L>
<L>And he has writ a Play&mdash;this very Play</L>
<L>Which you are all come here to see, to day;</L>
<L>And so it being an usual thing, to speak</L>
<L>Something or other, for the Author's sake,</L>
<L>Before the Play (in hopes to make it take)</L>
<L>I'm come, being his Friend and Fellow Play'r,</L>
<L>To say what (if you please) you're like to hear.</L>
<L>First know, that favour which I'd fain have shown,</L>
<L>I ask not for, in his Name, but my own;</L>
<L>For, without Vanity, I'm better known.</L>
<L>Mean time then, let me beg you would forbear</L>
<L>Your Cat-calls, 'and the Instruments of War;</L>
<L>For Mercy, Mercy, at your Feet we fall,</L>
<L>Before your roaring Gods destroy us all,</L>
<L>I'll speak with words sweet as distilling Honey,</L>
<L>With words,&mdash;as if I meant to borrow Money;</L>
<L>Fair, gentle Sirs, most soft, alluring Beatis,</L>
<L>Think 'tis a Lady, that for pity sues.</L>
<L>Bright Ladies&mdash;but to gain the Ladies Grace,</L>
<L>I think I need no more than shew my Face.</L>
<L>Next then you Authors, be not you severe;</L>
<L>Why, what a swarm of Scriblers have we here!</L>
<L>One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten,</L>
<L>All in one row, and Brothers of the Pen.</L>
<L>All, wou'd-be-Poets, well, your favour's due</L>
<L>To this days Author; for he's one of you.</L>
<L>Among the few, which are of noted Fame</L>
<L>I'm safe; for I my self am one of them.</L>
<L>You've seen me Smoak at <HI>Will</HI>'s, among the Wits;</L>
<L>I'm witty too, as they are&mdash;that's by fits.</L>
<L>Now, you our City Friends, who hither come</L>
<L>By three a Clock, to make sure Elbow-room:</L>
<L>While Spouse, tuckt up, does in her Pattens trudge it</L>
<L>With Hankerchief of prog, like Prull with Budget,</L>
<L>And here, by turns, you eat Plumb-Cake, and judge it.</L>
<L>Pray be you kind, let me your Grace importune,</L>
<L>Or else&mdash;Igad I'll tell you all your Fortune.</L>
<L>Well now, I have but one thing more to say,</L>
<L>And that's in reference to our third day;</L>
<L>An odd request&mdash;may be you'll think it so;</L>
<L>Pray come, whether you like the Play, or no:</L>
<L>And if you'll stay, we shall be glad to see you,</L>
<L>If not&mdash;leave your Half-Crowns, and peace be wi' you.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mrs. <HI>Knight.</HI></BYLINE>
<L>TRoth, Gentlemen, there's such an Itch in Scribling,</L>
<L>That even our puny Whisler must be nibbling.</L>
<L>What though he had seen what stronger Pens had writ,</L>
<L>With all the Nerves of Sense, and Brawn of Wit,</L>
<L>His Pigmey Muses narrower Dimensions,</L>
<L>To that vast Bulk, have no such fair Pretensions.</L>
<L>Well, then, for our small Poet, what Defence?</L>
<L>Troth, none at all. He owns his Impudence:</L>
<L>And if he thought 'twou'd do him any good,</L>
<L>He vows he wou'd be Modest, if he cou'd:</L>
<L>Swears he wou'd blush, with all the signs of Grace,</L>
<L>Only a Blush wou'd spoil his Players Face,</L>
<L>And that were a sad mortifying Case.</L>
<L>But hang't, for once, good Sirs, let his Play hit,</L>
<L>And, if 'tis possible, allow him Wit:</L>
<L>Not that he has it, only you must know</L>
<L>That Wit goes a great way to make a Beau.</L>
<L>Nor can you guess how pressing an Occasion</L>
<L>He has for such a spruce Qualification.</L>
<L>For could he once write Beau, Oh the fine things,</L>
<L>Laces, and Linnen, Points, and Cravat strings,</L>
<L>Would all come trouling in, a Lumping Bargain,</L>
<L>From the Fair Votaries of <HI>Covent Garden.</HI></L>

<P>A plague upon her, this is to refuse any Courtesie to a Widow. A small slip of frailty now, might have soften'd all this indignation; but <HI>Iery,</HI> thou shou'dst have told her, the Debts due to me, wou'd, when pay'd, almost redeem my Mortgage.</P>

<P>She said, 'twas as impossible to know when that time wou'd be, as 'twas for a Navigator to discover the Creeks and Sounds of the <HI>North-East,</HI> and <HI>North-West</HI> passages: And tho' you were so unwise, begging your Honour's pardon, to part with your Money, without good assurance of the return on'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> she was not; no, Sir, she says, she has hook'd in your Estate, and swears she'll quickly have it above water.</P>

<P>Plague on her Gibship; what course must I take? Mony I have none, Credit I have none, Friends I have none, and Igad, if it continues thus for one week longer, I may safely say, Honestly I have none.</P>
