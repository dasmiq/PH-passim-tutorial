<HEAD>The Portrait of WILLIAM MAR|QUIS
of New-Castle.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To his Lady, the Lady MARCHIONESSE.</HEAD>
<L>LEt Painters with dull Lines, and Colours faint</L>
<L>Go Portrait those whose bodies they Depaint,</L>
<L>The Poet, more then painter's requisite,</L>
<L>To Portrait one, who is all Sprit and Wit.</L>
<L>This nature seems full well t'have understood,</L>
<L>Framing him as nigh Spirit as she co'd,</L>
<L>Of Bulke not bigge, to shew Nobility,</L>
<L>Dos more 'ith mind's then body's greatnesse lye;</L>
<L>Of Visage <HI>Aquiline,</HI> as best dos fit</L>
<L>A piercing Judgement, and a piercing Wit:</L>
<L>And Flaxen Hayre, a colour dos presage</L>
<L>As well an Aged Youth, as Youthful Age.</L>
<L>And who would see th' Epitom&egrave; of Wit</L>
<L>Let them but read the Comedies h'as Writ,</L>
<L><PB REF="3">
Whose Excellent VARIETIES do show</L>
<L>That none the world and Men, dos better know,</L>
<L>Nor better understands the Art, then he,</L>
<L>To gain them all by Noble Courtesie</L>
<L>Who have no greater happinesse then when</L>
<L>He speaks, nor greater unhapinesse agen,</L>
<L>Then when he ceases speaking, his discourse</L>
<L>H'as so much quicknesse, Energy, and force:</L>
<L>For Horseman-ship and Arms then, there is none</L>
<L>In our Age fit <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">o Write, but he alone;</L>
<L>As none to Judge of it can be so fit</L>
<L>As those alone, who read what he has Writ;</L>
<L>Surmounts the <HI>Macedon,</HI> in Managing</L>
<L>The furious Beast, and that <HI>Albanian</HI> King</L>
<L>In Arms, whose blows so Inevitable were,</L>
<L>As none co'd Live, but those whom he wo'd spare.</L>
<L>This partly was in cause, his Prince did call</L>
<L>Him, to the Honoured charge of General,</L>
<L><PB REF="3">
When right was weak, if power were away,</L>
<L>And Sword then Scepter boar the greater sway.</L>
<L>Of which so brave accompt he rendred, he</L>
<L>(Whilst Leader) still came off with Victory.</L>
<L>Where 'twas his Valour, Conduct, Vigilance,</L>
<L>(All which, in War, do oft command o'r chance)</L>
<L>Or's popularity (as who commands</L>
<L>Must have his Souldiers Hearts, as well as Hands)</L>
<L>Or finally, his Fortune 'bove the rest,</L>
<L>What er'e it was, most certain 'tis the best</L>
<L>Of other Leaders was or' come, with th' same</L>
<L>Army, with which he alwaies overcame.</L>
<L>But leaving's Warlike vertue now, to come</L>
<L>To's civil ones, who lookt on him at home,</L>
<L>Imagin'd in his House they did not see</L>
<L>A man, but God of Hospitality,</L>
<L>Fed more at's Board, then nature at her Breast,</L>
<L>When shee's most bountiful, amongst the rest</L>
<L><PB REF="4">
His Entertainment of the KING was such,</L>
<L>The state so Royal, and expence so much,</L>
<L>It ever will be questioned whe're that, or</L>
<L>The Entertaining's Army cost him more.</L>
<L>So far he went both in expence and state</L>
<L>Above a <HI>Cressus,</HI> or <HI>Lucullus</HI> rate.</L>
<L>'Bove all, he was so great a Cherisher</L>
<L>Of Artes and Learning, as 'tis doubted where</L>
<L>The Air (by which they vital breath receave,</L>
<L>The Common Aliment, of all that breath)</L>
<L>To th' Lives o'th Learned, did confer more Good,</L>
<L>Then did his benefits, to their Livelyhood.</L>
<L>From which contempt of riches 'twas, that he</L>
<L>'Ith Common losse, lost all so cheerfully,</L>
<L>Who in a Noble cause, no difference made</L>
<L>'Twixt giving, and 'twixt loosing all he had.</L>
<L>Bravely in poverty, comforting himself</L>
<L>That where no other way's t'arive to wealth</L>
<L>But by ignoble means, ther's nothing more</L>
<L><PB REF="4">
Becom's a Nobleman then to be poor.</L>
<L>That petty Cottages when they ruin'd lye</L>
<L>Turn all to dust and rubbish presently;</L>
<L>But mighty pallaces and structures, farre</L>
<L>More Venerable by their ruins are</L>
<L>And in wyld Woods, Robbers and thieves molest,</L>
<L>Your thieves are known by going bravely drest</L>
<L>In others spoyls, but th' honest man's best known</L>
<L>By being rob'd, and spoyled of his own.</L>
<L>So stands he like some goodly Oake had stood</L>
<L>Long time the pride and glory of the Wood,</L>
<L>By stormes and winter, reft of all it's Leaves,</L>
<L>Far more their harm, and detrement, receaves</L>
<L>Shaddow and shelter from it then it's own,</L>
<L>That<HI>'s</HI> more it self, when all these leaves are gone.</L>
<L>And if our spring tide er'e again return</L>
<L>(As w'are not under such a climat born</L>
<L>To have t' perpetual winter) you shall see</L>
<L>All flock agen unto this Noble Tree</L>
<L><PB REF="5">
And th' <HI>Nimphs</HI> &amp; swains of <HI>Sherwood</HI> with their lays,</L>
<L>Dauncing about it, chanting of it's praise,</L>
<L>And Crowning it flowers and laurel, when</L>
<L><HI>Welbeck</HI> and <HI>Bolswol</HI> shall behold agen</L>
<L>Their Noble Lord as flourishing and more</L>
<L>Then er'e in better times, he was before,</L>
<L>So Prophesies (for Poets are Prophets too)</L>
<L>The humblest honourer of him and you.</L>
