<L>Long kept in darkness, and severely staid</L>
<L>From looking forth, by him who thought the dress</L>
<L>He cloth'd her in, too homly to express</L>
<L>That native Beauty, which by birth she drew,</L>
<L>From her first Parent, who exactly knew</L>
<L>How to attire her in so rich a Trim,</L>
<L>As might win honour both to her, and him:</L>
<L>Greeving perhaps to be so coursely us'd,</L>
<L>So long pent up, and as she thought abus'd:</L>
<L>Resolv'd to try if yet her ancient Fame,</L>
<L>Could raise her up to a more glorious Name:</L>
<L>And guided by the Star which rul'd her Fate,</L>
<L>At last she met with one more fortunate,</L>
<L>Then her old Foster Father was: And he</L>
<L>(Fraught with the store of rich ability.)</L>
<L>Bravely adorn'd her,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Translated by Mr. Rich. Fans<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aw, and dedicat|ed to the Prince that then wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI></NOTE> taught her how to speak</L>
<L>A Courtly Language, and thereby to break</L>
<L>Through all the Mists of dark obscurity,</L>
<L>As one now fitted for a Princes Eye.</L>
<L>This rare adventure, wrought a strange conceit</L>
<L>In this more lowly Minion, that my streit,</L>
<L>And rigid resolution held so long,</L>
<L>To Coop them up, had done them both some wrong</L>
<L>For whilest I gave her Sister leave to walk,</L>
<L>From hand to hand by stealth, she heard men talk</L>
<L>Of gracious Favours, and Aspects, cast on her</L>
<L>By Noble persons, and by men of Honour;</L>
<L>And thence concludes, 'twas onely want of scope</L>
<L>To fly abroad which thus destroid her hope.</L>
<L>And that her self (though meanly pris'd by me)</L>
<L><PB REF="3">Might have attaind the same felicitie:</L>
<L>These fond ambitious Thoughts; and sad Laments</L>
<L>Grounded upon her groundless discontents,</L>
<L>Have forc't me yeild unto her mournful plaint</L>
<L>And loose the Fetters of her hard restraint.</L>
<L>Granting her leave to roam abroad at large,</L>
<L>Yet not without this strict, and serious charge</L>
<L>That she should not presume to think her Name</L>
<L>Could purchase her, or me, a lasting Fame;</L>
<L>Nor yet expect, that her best industrie</L>
<L>Could raise her up unto the least degree</L>
<L>Of Grace and Favour, with judicious men,</L>
<L>Who know the failings of my erring Pen;</L>
<L>But rather that she should conform her mind</L>
<L>To my mean fortune, as unlike to find</L>
<L>A way to better hopes, as I am free</L>
<L>From those aspiring thoughts, which use to be</L>
<L>In men of greater Parts, whose merits may,</L>
<L>Challenge a due respect, where worth bears sway:</L>
<L>And since she could not be content to dwell</L>
<L>In my poor quiet, though but homely Cell,</L>
<L>Where she might have been free from all the wrongs</L>
<L>Of envious hearts, and of malicious tongues,</L>
<L>That yet she would put on an humble guise</L>
<L>A modest garb, without desire to rise</L>

<L>The Isle of <HI>Scyros,</HI> this the River where,</L>

<L>All rent and torn, so lately furled up</L>

<L>And ever showring Rain.</L>
<L>Loud claps of Thunder, with their roaring noise,</L>
<L>As Trumpets of the universe were heard,</L>
<L>Now here, now there, in those confused wars,</L>
<L>Of all the troubled Elements to sound</L>
<L>The bold defiance of the winds.</L>
<L>Impetuous Whirl-winds, with most horrid flaws,</L>

<L>To whom high Heaven hath vouchsaf't that Grace,</L>
<L>To reconcile the disagreeing jars,</L>

<L>Opens her fruitful bosome, and displaies</L>

<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<L>O My sweet <HI>Celia,</HI> Scarce had I rob'd</L>
<L>The Fertile Earth of a few fragrant Flowers.</L>
<L>Before I lost the sight of the: But why</L>
<L>Turn'st thou away those eyes, and why those steps</L>
<L>In such a troubled guise? dost thou disdain</L>
<L>That I should look upon thee once again?</L>
<L>What suddain change is this? when first I came,</L>
<L>This morning to thy Lodg, scarce didst thou deign</L>
<L>To entertain me with a seeming smile:</L>
<L>Which yet discovered plainly that thy Heart</L>
<L>Answered not to thy looks: and when thou then</L>
<L>With thy neglecting Arms didst make a shew,</L>
<L>As if thou wouldst embrace me, thou didst not</L>
<L>Hug me close in thy bosom: but at last</L>
<L>From thy cold frozen Lips, thou didst let fall;</L>
<L>Not dart a kiss at me and with a soft</L>
<L>Dull fainting voice, I knew not if thou saidst</L>
<L>Th'art welcome <HI>Cloris,</HI> but 'tis sure enough,</L>
<L>I could not here thee say, as thou wert wont,</L>
<L>(Whilst I was dear to thee) my life, my heart,</L>
<L>My gentle <HI>Cloris</HI> welcome.</L>
<L>After all this thou gav'st thy self to stray,</L>
<L>And wander up and down, troubled and sad,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="13">I follow thee, thou flyest,</L>
<L>I speak, thou wilt not answer me,</L>
<L>I look upon thy lovely Face, thou weepest,</L>
<L>And dost thou hate me then ingrateful Wench</L>
<L>What have I done, that could deserve thy hate?</L>
<L>Or rather, what 'ist that I have not done</L>
<L>To make thee love me? Are we still the same</L>
<L>That we were wont to be?</L>
<L>Am I still <HI>Cloris,</HI> art thou <HI>Celia</HI>?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Celia.</SPEAKER>
<L>O grief that Wounds my Heart, Ah grant me but</L>
<L>So short a respit as may give me leave</L>
<L>To answer her, and yet conceal my grief.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<L>And wilt thou thou then discurtious as thou art,</L>
<L>Deny to me a part of these lost words</L>
<L>which thou so freely spendest in the Ayr?</L>
<L>Who must I speak to now, since thou deniest</L>
<L>To give me Answer? What 'ist I must doe?</L>
<L>Ayme, since thou, who only heretofore,'</L>
<L>Wert wont to lessen my tormenting pains,</L>
<L>Art now she that torments me? but allas,</L>
<L>This happily is some prodigious signe,</L>
<L>Of my more desperate ruine, and perhaps</L>
<L>High Heaven hath decreed, my tears shall be</L>
<L>Eternal, since it now denyes to stay</L>
<L>Her that was wont to wipe them all away.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Celia.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ah <HI>Cloris,</HI> Ah my Life!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<L>That same, my Life, comes from thy mouth <HI>per</HI> force.</L>
<L>I know it well enough, 'twas not thy Heart</L>
<L>That sent it thither.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Celia.</SPEAKER>
<L>Let them dissemble then that can, my Tongue</L>
<L>Cannot tell how to give my heart the lye;</L>
<L>Hear me then <HI>Cloris,</HI> and I do not say</L>
<L>Life, of my Life, because my Life to me,</L>
<L>Is now a burden; but thou art not so.</L>
<L>I am no more that <HI>Celia,</HI> that I was.</L>
<L>Tis true: but what so ere I am, I fly,</L>
<L>And hate my self, not thee:</L>
<L>Thus far thou mayst know of me, but no more;</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="14">Permit me then to wander still alone,</L>
<L>In secret horrors of the savage Woods,</L>
<L>Where through obscurity of darksome shades</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ahyme, what new malignant Star</L>
<L>Hath Heaven produc't that can compel thy grief,</L>
<L>Thus to neglect it self? and shall I then</L>
<L>Forsake thee too? Not till I know thy ill.</L>
<L>Yet what but love, and his most intricate</L>
<L>Turmoyls, can trouble thus thy happy state?</L>
<L>I oft have heard the wisest lovers say</L>
<L>He knows no grief, that knows not loves delay.</L>
<L>For else what can it be? unless perhaps,</L>
<L>(And can that bring so great a misery?</L>
<L>Mongst other Nimphs upon some solemn day;</L>
<L>Thy Darts or Arrows, have not cleft the Mark;</L>
<L>Or by misfortune, happily thou hast lost</L>
<L>Thy goodly Ivory Bow: I see it not</L>
<L>Hang by thy side: Or is thy gentle Kid</L>
<L>Thy dearest dear delight (and this 'tis true</L>
<L>Is the most sad mishap ill luck can send)</L>
<L>Is he, I say, come to untimely end?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Celia.</SPEAKER>
<L>He was at least the cause of all my woe</L>
<L>For by his means I did become the prey</L>
<L>Of <HI>Eurito</HI> the <HI>Centaur</HI>: whence arose</L>
<L>The spring and sourse of all my misery,</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<L>Wert thou the <HI>Centaurs</HI> prey? and how? and when?</L>
<L>Do not conceal so strange an accident.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colia.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ile tell it thee, but ask me then no more.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<L>Be it as thou wilt have it.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Celia.</SPEAKER>
<L>Hear then, and when I have declar'd,</L>
<L>The mournful story of my ravishment</L>
<L>Be thou content to leave me here alone.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<L>Go on I prethee.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Celia.</SPEAKER>
<L>That very day when thou (about to take</L>
<L>Thy journey to those Solemn Festivals,</L>
<L>Which in the Holy Isle they celebrate</L>
<L>To the great Goddess) camest to take thy leave,</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="14">Of me at my poor Cell: I to restrain</L>
<L>Those Tears which thy departure forct me to,</L>
<L>(As if I had foreseen (woes me) that soon,</L>
<L>I should have have far more urgent cause to give</L>
<L>Full scope to their impetuous Torrent)</L>
<L>I gave my self the liberty to sport</L>
<L>And dally with that nimble frisking Kid:</L>
<L>Whose gentle Gamesomeness, was wont to chear</L>
<L>All my sad froward thoughts; whilest they were such,</L>
<L>As could admit of any gamesomeness.</L>
<L>That harmless Beast, or in his harmless shape</L>
<L>My perverse fortune, by a thousand trains<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></L>
<L>Of wanton sports, entic't me to that Shore</L>
<L>Where the proud Sea hath wrought it self so near</L>
<L>Unto the Woods, that shaddows seem to swim,</L>
<L>And flouds repose themselves under the shade.</L>
<L>There whilst I spent some time to gather up</L>
<L>Such Cockle Shels, as Nature had adorn'd</L>
<L>With various pride, that I might weave them streight,</L>
<L>Into a collor for my pretty Kid,</L>
<L>Behinde me I could hear the rushing noise</L>
<L>Of a rude boisterous creature, and ere scarce</L>
<L>I well could turn mine eyes, I might perceive</L>
<L>Close at my back, I know not which to say</L>
<L>A man or beast: Whose fury came so fast,</L>
<L>As flung the smaller Sands into my face,</L>
<L>And forc't me shut mine eyes:</L>
<L>Thus neither seeing how, nor yet by whom,</L>
<L>I felt my self snatcht up and born away.</L>
<L>Fain would I have cryed out, but my weak voice,</L>
<L>Not daring to put sorth it self, retired</L>
<L>And fled in silence to my throbbing Heart.</L>
<L>Whilest I, as one half dead, could not recall</L>
<L>My straggling sences back, till I was brought</L>
<L>Into the inmost parts of those thick Woods.</L>
<L>And found my self become the wretched prey,</L>
<L>Of a most horrid Monster.</L>
<L>I found my self (and tremble yet to think</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="15">What then I found) close graspt within the Arms</L>
<L>Of that mishapen <HI>Cent aur,</HI> that foul fiend,</L>
<L>Whom thou mayst yet if thou hast so much heart,</L>
<L>Lodg'd in thine eyes, behold and wonder at</L>
<L>Thy self, within the Temple.</L>

<L>Alas my hair stands upright on an end</L>
<L>To hear him but describ'd.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Celia.</SPEAKER>
<L>There, to a sturdy Oak, he bound me fast</L>
<L>And re-enforct his base inhumane bonds</L>
<L>With the then danglinst Tresses of my hair,</L>
<L>Ingrateful bair, ill-nurtur'd wicked Locks!</L>
<L>The cruel wretch then took up from the foot</L>
<L>Both my loose tender garments, and at once</L>
<L>Rent them from end to end: Imagine then</L>
<L>Whether my crimson red, through shame was chang'd</L>
<L>Into a pale wan tincture, yea or no.</L>
<L>I that was looking towards Heaven then,</L>
<L>And with my cries imploring ayd from thence,</L>
<L>Upon a suddain to the Earth let fall</L>
<L>My shamefac't eyes, and shut them close, as if</L>
<L>Under mine eye-lids, I could cover all</L>
<L>My naked Members, but considering well</L>
<L>His fell intent, with a deep groaning sigh,</L>
<L>To him I said, behold me ready now</L>
<L>Fit for thy ravenous throat, come quickly, come,</L>
<L>And satiate thy beastly hunger.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<L>And why his hunger, say, poor silly wretch?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Celia.</SPEAKER>
<L>That being once devour'd, I might at least</L>
<L>Within his paunch conceal my nakedness.</L>

<L><HI>Nerea</HI> beleeves it not, but laught aloud</L>
<L>When first I told it her; but prithee say,</L>
<L>Why should he so desire to have me bound,</L>
<L>And naked as I was but that he might</L>
<L>Swallow me up alive, and with more ease</L>
<L>Conveigh me piece-meal gliding down his throat?</L>
<L>And even then he came with open Arms,</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="15">And snatcht to gripe me by the naked Brest,</L>
<L>When, lo, two Shepheads running fast for hast</L>
<L>Came in unto my rescue.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oh! how my heart's reviv'd! and who were those</L>
<L>Whom Heaven in pitty chose out for thine ayde?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Celia.</SPEAKER>
<L><HI>Amyntas,</HI> old <HI>Sirenos</HI> Son, whose joy</L>
<L>And whole delights in Hunting, with his friend</L>
<L><HI>Niso,</HI> a stranger, whom thou dost not know.</L>
<L>Ay me poor soul!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<L>What! art thou sighing still?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Celia.</SPEAKER>
<L>I have good cause.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<L>But how came it to pass that in a place</L>
<L>So far remote, two Shepherds should arrive</L>
<L>Both at one instance?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Celia.</SPEAKER>
<L><HI>Amyntas,</HI> was within the Valley where</L>
<L>He stood to Watch his Toyls, and <HI>Niso</HI> came</L>
<L>From the Sea shore, whither but then the Winds</L>
<L>Had brought him from a Country far away,</L>
<L>And both brought thither by my shrieking cries:</L>
<L>They both arriv'd together; where the one</L>
<L>Lets fly his Dart, the other shoots a Shaft,</L>
<L>And neither one nor other mist his aime.</L>
<L>The cruel <HI>Centaur</HI> thus but lightly hurt</L>
<L>In his left shoulder, and in his right arme</L>
<L>Lost some small blood, which was supply'd with rage:</L>
<L>And so betwixt them three, there soon begun</L>
<L>A fierce and bloody fight, till that proud beast</L>
<L>Scorning that two such Stripling should have power</L>
<L>So to withstand his fury, thought at once</L>
<L>To strike a deadly blow, by which he meant</L>
<L>To speed them both, and brandashing his Beam,</L>
<L>The Tree which happily some pitty felt</L>
<L>Of my sad state, did so involve it in</L>
<L>The knotty intricacies of his boughs,</L>
<L>As it fell from his hand:</L>
<L>And he that found his Arme thus without armes,</L>
<L>And without heart, his heart betook him streight</L>
<L>To a most shameful slight, and from the Woods</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="16">Whilest he up towards the Mountains took his way</L>
<L>It was his fortune to fall in those Toyls</L>
<L>Which to catch other beasts, <HI>Amyntas</HI> had</L>
<L>Before plac't in the Yale.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<L>And so the insolent proud villain was</L>
<L>Himself made now their prey.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Celia.</SPEAKER>
<L>The Shepherds followed him; but yet not far</L>
<L>Ere they fell to the Earth, through loss of blood,</L>
<L>Which from their wounds did like a Torrent flow,</L>
<L>And ran even to my feet, sad Messenger</L>
<L>Of their approaching ends, to crave mine ayd.</L>
<L>I shall now tell thee <HI>Cloris,</HI> what will seem</L>
<L>A wonder to thee, yet it is most true:</L>
<L>Pitty to see their case, made me to strain</L>
<L>My self with so much force, as I got free</L>
<L>From all my bonds, even from those self same bonds</L>
<L>I freed my self, to give another aide,</L>
<L>Which I a thousand times had tried before</L>
<L>For mine own safety, and could not unloose.</L>
<L>When I was free, I had almost for hast</L>
<L>Run to them naked; but consider now</L>
<L>A strange affection.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<L>And what hast thou told yet, that is not strange?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Celia.</SPEAKER>
<L>When I was got where those two Shepherds lay</L>
<L>Half dead, half living, and in reason should</L>
<L>Have stopt their bleeding wounds up with my Vail,</L>
<L>I first beheld the one, and then the other,</L>
<L>To this I went and afterwards to that,</L>
<L>Desiring still to help them both at once,</L>
<L>And yet gave help to neither, as not well</L>
<L>Resolv'd to whom I first should lend my help;</L>
<L>At last I did begin, but knew not where,</L>
<L>And whilst my hand, was busie about one</L>
<L>My heart ran to the other, so that I</L>
<L>Could not well know to which I wisht more ease.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<L>What didst thou do at last?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Celia.</SPEAKER>
<L>All that I could, yet all was nothing worth:</L>
<L>Till those same fearful howlings, which 'gainst Heaven,</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="16">That horrid Monster sent up from the Toils</L>
<L>Made all the Valleys far and neer to Ring,</L>
<L>And drew both Nimphs and Sheapherds to those parts,</L>
<L>Where when they came, too soon to them appears</L>
<L>Two over-whelm'd in blood, and one in tears.</L>
<L>They speedily conveigh'd the wounded pair</L>
<L>To old <HI>Sirenos</HI> House, the Father of</L>
<L>Poor young <HI>Amyntas.</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>

<L>And live they yet? yet their strength restor'd?</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Celia.</SPEAKER>
<L>I cannot tell.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<L>And canst thou take so little care for those</L>
<L>Who for thy safety thus ingaged their lives?</L>
<L>Sure thou art too ingrate.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Celia.</SPEAKER>
<L><HI>Cloris,</HI> no more, this is the Period, when</L>
<L>I must enjoyn thee silence, thou hast heard</L>
<L>All that thou didst demand, now let me part;</L>
<L>Ay me, what do I see?</L>

<P>Those very men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<L>But how could love inflict a double wound,</L>

<SP>

<L>Ile tell thee now a wounder.</L>
<L>Love that before had ever found me arm'd,</L>
<L>Against his shafts and all his subtile trains.</L>
<L>By others wounds; and through anothers heart,</L>
<L>Found passage into mine. And whilst that they,</L>
<L>Wounded to death lay breathing forth their souls,</L>
<L>Love all besmeared with their goary blood,</L>
<L>Usurpt the shape of pitty, and then arm'd</L>
<L>Under this quaint disguise, the traiterous boy</L>
<L>Found means to wound my heart: and after that</L>
<L>Neglecting both mine Arrows, and my Bow,</L>
<L>Despising, Earth, the Sea, and Heaven it self,</L>
<L><PB N="37" REF="26">I found no rest to my tormented soul,</L>
<L>Longer then I stood languishing, besides</L>
<L>Those wounded Shepherds, and with weeping eyes</L>
<L>Mixing my plaints with theirs.</L>
<L>There from their fainting foreheads, I did wipe,</L>
<L>The cold distilled sweat, there with these hands</L>
<L>Did I still dress their wounds, Oh cruel wounds</L>
<L>That whilst I drest them, could thus wound my soul,</L>
<L>Yet had I then some Truce with sorrow, when</L>
<L>I said within my self unhappy Maid,</L>
<L>What new found sighs are these, whence can proceed</L>
<L>This unaccustomed heat which boyleth thus</L>
<L>In thine inflamed heart? Ah silly fool</L>
<L>(Said then my heart to me) this is nought elese</L>
<L>But pitty; well deserved pitty: canst thou be</L>
<L>So ignorant, as not to know it then?</L>
<L>Or dost thou grudg them pitty, who to save</L>
<L>Thee from a fearful death, lye dying now?</L>
<L>Thus whilst I thought it pitty, and not love</L>
<L>Flatring my passion, I still nourisht it,</L>
<L>And still encreased my unknown desire,</L>
<L>But when I after came to know it well,</L>
<L>(Oh too too late discovery) when once,</L>
<L>I found them lovers, then too late I found</L>
<L>I was my self a woful lover too:</L>
<L>And by the light of their bright burning flame.</L>
<L>I saw mine own heart burning in the same.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serp.</SPEAKER>
<L>And art thou then with equal love belov'd?</L>
<L>By both of them again, this may abate</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Celia.</SPEAKER>
<L>By many, many, tokens, for me thought</L>

<L>Answer'd that sound again, and yet deceipt</L>
<L>I know not how, did so obscure my sence</L>
<L>As I could not at first beleeve it true,</L>
<L>Till one day it fell out, that whilst the poor</L>

<L>Which day and night afflicted him so sore,</L>
<L>That he could hardly finde an hour to rest,</L>
<L>Pitty so wrought, as I obtained Truce,</L>
<L>Sometime with sorrow, that I might invite</L>
<L>With the soft accents of my slender voice</L>
<L>His heavy eyes to sleep.</L>
<L>When he with a sad sigh sent from his heart,</L>
<L>Darted a look at me, and to me said,</L>
<L>Ah my dear <HI>Celia,</HI> when I see thee not</L>
<L>I am, but as one dead, and canst thou think?</L>
<L>That when I see thee then, 'tis possible</L>
<L>For me to sleep, before those glorious beams</L>
<L>Which shine out of thine eyes? I thus surpris'd,</L>
<L>Straight fled feom him, and ran unto the place</L>
<L>Where wounded <HI>Niso</HI> lay, opprest with pain,</L>
<L>And calling for mine ayd.</L>
<L>Where whilst I gently did unbinde his wound,</L>
<L>A stream of blood, I know not how gusht forth.</L>
<L>And stain'd my naked breast; which seen he said</L>
<L>Oh <HI>Celia,</HI> do not disdain the blood</L>
<L>Which by instinct of Nature flies to thee,</L>
<L>Thou art my heart, and when man dies 'tis known</L>
<L>That to his heart his blood descendeth down:</L>
<L>Thus in an instant both their loving souls</L>
<L>Lay open to my view, and I who then</L>
<L>Scarce knew that I did live, felt in my heart</L>
<L>(Which yet could not be angry at their love)</L>
<L>Those Maiden thoughts, which labour'd to awake</L>
<L>That usual disdain, which Maidens use</L>
<L>Against loves first assault: but then, alas,</L>
<L>I could not use it, but instead thereof,</L>
<L>Found that in spite of me those amorous plaints</L>
<L>Made in my soul an amorous eccho sound:</L>
<L>Yet did I fly with speed, but all too late,</L>
<L>For all the speed that I could seem to make,</L>
<L>I then fled from them, and will never see</L>
<L>Again my hearts desir'd felicity:</L>
<L><PB N="39" REF="27">But though I fly them, 'tis impossible</L>
<L>To fly from love, who traces still my steps</L>
<L>By the cold drops of my distilling tears,</L>
<L>Even through most darksome shades, whereof I hide</L>
<L>My self from all besides, and sure I think</L>
<L>He knows me by my voice, and groaning sighs:</L>
<L>But to shun love, I yet can fly to death,</L>
<L>Why then <HI>Serpilla</HI> dost thou still delay</L>
<L>To ease me of this sad tormenting grief?</L>
<L>As ever thou didst pitty one distrest,</L>

<L>In vain, I tell thee, still in vain thou tryest</L>

<L>When suddenly the other shews himself</L>
<L>All torn and wounded in my just defence,</L>

<L>Thus in perpetual Wars the victory</L>
<L>Still flies from one to other, and remains</L>
<L>So small a while with either, as I doubt,</L>

<L>Softly! give ear,</L>
<L>Within the twinkling of an eye, he ran</L>
<L>Quite cross the Meadow, till at the last he came</L>
<L>Unto that little streaming Brook which runs,</L>
<L>Next to the Hill, and there began to feed</L>
<L>Upon an Hearb, which yet I never saw,</L>
<L>Grow any other where, and there did graze,</L>

<L>But on a suddain, Oh sad heavy chance,</L>

<L>That in an Instant, I flew to him straight?</L>
<L>I look't upon him, cal'd him, prest his Limbs:</L>
<L>He look't on me again, and seem'd to moan</L>
<L>His sad estate, and trembling seem'd to say,</L>
<L>Ah <HI>Filino</HI> I dye.</L>
<L>Thus did I see his eyes grow dark and dim,</L>
<L>Those pretty eyes of his, I saw retire,</L>
<L>Into his head, his eye-lids closed up.</L>

<P>O cruel and most savage heart!</P>

<L>Tush this was nothing, her fierce angry looks</L>
<L>Spake more than did her tongue; for all her speech</L>
<L>Was full of such obscurity, as I</L>
<L>Could hardly understand her what she meant;</L>
<L>But then I saw her cheeks grow pale as death,</L>
<L>Her ruby lips too lost their colour quite,</L>
<L>I did not see her weep, but yet I saw</L>
<L><PB N="55" REF="35">Her eyes full fraught with grief, though free from tears.</L>
<L>And then as if she had disdain'd her self,</L>

<L>At me without all doubt, and I my self,</L>

<L>This wound again, which is but newly clos'd,</L>
<L>That so her Shaft may find a shorter way,</L>
<L>Yea and a wider passage to my heart:</L>
<L>And since that cruel she denies to hear</L>

<L>And so perhaps in that same point of time</L>

<L>Unhappy Shepheard! ah! alass, those eyes,</L>
<L>Those lovely eyes of thine must not alone</L>

<L>My self weep with thee too for company.</L>
<L>But <HI>Niso,</HI> my sweet youth ('tis fit I should</L>
<L>Give him some comfort) I will not deny</L>
<L>But it is true that <HI>Celia</HI> shew'd her self</L>
<L>Beyond all measure cruel, yet who knows</L>
<L>But that she may for all this counterfeit?</L>
<L>For my part Ile not swear she doth not so.</L>
<L>The art of feigning is by nature taught</L>
<L>To women, so said one, and she said true:</L>
<L>For from their very birth they can conceal</L>
<L>Their inward thoughts, and though but children, yet</L>
<L>Under a frowning brow they have the art</L>
<L>In secret to conceal a loving heart.</L>
<L>But be she as she will, who yet can say</L>
<L>She may not change her mind? For women are</L>
<L><PB N="56" REF="36">Like to the Moon, and vary both their looks</L>
<L>And shapes as well as she, if then they love,</L>
<L>Yet trust them not, despair not though they hate,</L>

<L>Do'st thou not see the heavens in a trice</L>
<L>Both burn and freeze? It was but yesterday</L>
<L>When thou beganst to love, and scarce hast yet</L>
<L>Learnt to breath forth a sigh, 'tis not then time</L>
<L>Already to despair; a short breath'd sigh</L>
<L>Cannot through Loves vast ocean drive a soul</L>
<L>Into the port of rest, and full content:</L>
<L>Thou didst but now begin, and canst thou then</L>
<L>Despair already to attain thy wish?</L>
</SP>
<SP>

<L>'Tis true, alass, my love but now begins,</L>

<L>Thy love to her by any other means?</L>
<L>Didst thou not yet so much as in thy looks,</L>

<L>The first embassages of love?</L>
</SP>
<SP>

<L>Yes! but what profit have I gain'd?</L>
<L>When all my sighs breath'd through the empty air,</L>
<L>Were by the wind disperst ere they could come</L>
<L>Unto the breast to which I sent them forth?</L>

<L>Ah me! would death had shackled up my tongue,</L>

<L>And therefore since, with double <HI>N</HI> (because</L>
<L>One gift will not suffice) a Woman is</L>
<L>In the Italian tongue, call'd <HI>Donna</HI> now.</L>
<L>And if there be such wandring beggars stil,</L>

<L>HEre me <HI>Serpilla,</HI> stay, I held my peace</L>

<L>I understand them not, thou do'st let loose</L>
<L>With too too large a stream, the torrent of</L>
<L>So many comforts on a narrow heart,</L>
<L>Infuse it gently therefore drop by drop,</L>
<L>And tel me first, that <HI>Thirsis,</HI> and that <HI>Phillis</HI> which</L>

<L>They both shall live, and are become withall</L>
<L>The most contented happy lovers that</L>

<L>And was it not then true, that for desire,</L>
<L>Cruel desire of their long wisht for death,</L>
<L>The <HI>Thra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ian</HI> Emperour did with such rage</L>

<L>That I cannot tell, but sure I am that <HI>Thrace</HI></L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nar.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yet <HI>Cloris</HI> did affirm it here, but she</L>
<L>Was certainly deceiv'd by the fraud</L>
<L>Of him in <HI>Smirna</HI> that conceal'd them both,</L>
<L>And with good cause <HI>Melisso</HI> did suspect</L>
<L>That he did but dissemble what he said,</L>
<L><PB N="109" REF="62">That so they both of them for fear of death</L>
<L>Might labour with the greater art to keep</L>
<L>Themselves from being known.</L>

<SPEAKER>Serp.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis true <HI>Oronte</HI> saith it too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nar.</SPEAKER>
<L>O then how vain is humane providence?</L>
<L>He sought to cover that by fear of death</L>
<L>Which now desire of death hath brought to light.</L>
<L>But for the fault about the hoop of gold</L>
<L>Which here was carelesly thrown on the ground</L>
<L>For the contempt against the image shewn,</L>
<L>How could <HI>Oronte</HI> find a means to save</L>
<L>The guilty person thus against the Law?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serp.</SPEAKER>
<L>Their case was dangerous and for my part</L>
<L>I gave them both for dead, and mourned for</L>
<L>Their hard mishap; but see how it fell out,</L>
<L>Wearied with following <HI>Niso</HI> whom I fought,</L>
<L>I sate me down close by the temple side,</L>
<L>Where straight a rumour was disperst abroad,</L>
<L>I know not well from whence, that all in hast</L>
<L><HI>Oronte</HI> then was coming, and did bring</L>
<L>Unto the temple two unhappy wights,</L>
<L>Before condemn'd to dye for their contempt</L>
<L>Unto the royal image of his Lord:</L>
<L>At whose sad coming the proud <HI>Thracians</HI> seem'd</L>
<L>To laugh for joy, and so from thousand tongues</L>
<L>Sent forth one cry that reacht to heaven it self,</L>
<L>Exclaming let him dye, O let him dye:</L>
<L>But presently <HI>Oronte</HI> darts about</L>
<L>A fierce imperious look, at which they all</L>
<L>Amaz'd in silence mutter'd not a word</L>
<L>When he reply'd, Hear O you <HI>Thracians,</HI> hear</L>
<L>The supream Laws of <HI>Thrace</HI> have onely force</L>
<L>Within the <HI>Thracian</HI> Empire, and against</L>
<L>Those that do serve the <HI>Thracian</HI> Emperour,</L>
<L>But <HI>Scyros</HI> is not as you now beleeve</L>
<L>Subject unto that Empire, hear your selves</L>
<L>Th' Imperial decree which in this Ring,</L>
<L>This very Ring it self, in which engrav'd</L>
<L>The royal Image stands, is written here</L>
<L><PB N="110" REF="63">In fair <HI>Egyptian</HI> Charracters, and then</L>
<L>Ile read it with a voyce so audible,</L>
<L>And I with that attention heard it read,</L>

<L>As I dare confidently swear I can</L>
<L>Repeat it word for word.</L>

<SPEAKER>Nar.</SPEAKER>
<L>O amongst all whom the blest sun doth warm</L>
<L>With his reviving heat, and when the Sea</L>
<L>Bathes with his quiet waves, dearly belov'd,</L>
<L>And by Celestial providence now made</L>
<L>Most happy Isle! the winds shall now no more</L>
<L>Conveigh thy mournful sighs, above the waves,</L>
<L>After thy dear lost children: but the babes</L>
<L>Whom thou do'st generate, shall bless their birth,</L>
<L>And be by thee sustained whilest they live,</L>
<L>And when they dye rest in thy graves in peace,</L>
<L>That so thou mayst to thy dear issue be</L>
<L><PB N="111" REF="63">A fruitful Mother, and a careful Nurse,</L>
<L>And left a Tombe to free them from the curse,</L>
<L>Of wandring souls, that find no sepulchres,</L>
<L>But <HI>Phillis,</HI> then and <HI>Thirsis,</HI> what said they,</L>
<L>Or how did they behave themselves?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serp.</SPEAKER>
<L>Their first encounter was, (like such as seem'd</L>
<L>Retir'd for fear, and much perplexed with</L>
<L>The suddain tremblings of a doubtful heart)</L>
<L>Bashful and nice, and being thereto drawn</L>
<L>Even by <HI>Orontes</HI> self, who joyn'd their hands</L>
<L>They seemed to embrace unwillingly,</L>
<L>And kiss as 'twere by force;</L>
<L>But having fuel thus put to their fire,</L>
<L>It quickly then encreased to a flame,</L>
<L>And each hug'd other so, as you may see,</L>
<L>The twining Ivy when it seeks to clasp,</L>
<L>A full grown Elme, as if it seem'd to say</L>
<L>It could not well subsist without that stay.</L>
<L>Then might you see from one to others mouth</L>
<L>A thousand kisses in an instant sent,</L>
<L>And whilst their amorous lips as overcharg'd</L>
<L>Stood sucking here, and there loves <HI>Nectar</HI> thus,</L>
<L>That sweetness, followed, and that Rubie Die,</L>
<L>So grac't those lips as that they seem'd to me</L>
<L>Flowers that did bear both honey, and the Bee,</L>
<L>So that at last you might perceive the cleer,</L>
<L>And lively beams of their quick piercing eyes,</L>
<L>Grow faint and dul, as overcome with sence</L>
<L>Of too much pleasure, and extream delight,</L>
<L>And I that saw it, sayd within my self</L>
<L>Ah me! 'twere to be fear'd these two would dye,</L>
<L>But that ther's hope that in a skirmish of</L>
<L>So many kisses, neithers soul can find</L>
<L>A way to vanish, and leave them behinde.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narete.</SPEAKER>
<L>And could poor <HI>Phillis</HI> then so soon put off</L>
<L>The thought of her disdain? could she so soon</L>
<L>Forget the injury of that new flame</L>
<L>Wherein her <HI>Thirsis</HI> burnt for <HI>Celia</HI>?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serp.</SPEAKER>
<L>It seems that yet thou do'st not understan</L>
<L>The laws of loves kind duels, thou must know</L>
<L><PB N="112" REF="64">A venie of sweet kisses one to one is able to give satisfaction</L>
<L>For any injury love can sustain:</L>
<L>But if thou dost consider all things well</L>
<L><HI>Tirsis</HI> did her no wrong, he was deceiv'd,</L>
<L>And did beleeve her dead; and tis well known</L>
<L>That loves great empire though't be vast and larg,</L>
<L>Doth not extend beyond the bounds of life,</L>
<L>Love hath no jurisdiction ore the dead,</L>
<L>Nor can his fire raise any kindly heat</L>
<L>Amongst those frozen reliques, those cold bones:</L>
<L>Besides all this, if any mark can rest</L>
<L>Of fault in <HI>Thirsis,</HI> he hath shed those tears</L>
<L>That may suffice to wash away the stain,</L>
<L>And what can she have more? poor soul in deep</L>
<L>Repentance for his errour, he did here</L>
<L>Submit himself to death, and happy was</L>
<L>That Errour that could find a way to make</L>
<L>So generous amends.</L>
<L>Or rather happy was that errour which</L>
<L>By erring thus could find a way to make</L>
<L>So many blest, whom it did not offend.</L>
<L>His love to <HI>Celia</HI> was the happy cause</L>
<L>Of all our happiness, for thence it came</L>
<L>That <HI>Thirsis</HI> was first known to <HI>Phillis,</HI> then</L>
<L><HI>Phillis</HI> to him, and last of all, that both</L>
<L>Were to the <HI>Thracians</HI> known.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nar.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thou saist exceeding true, and now behold</L>
<L>How full of windings and obscurity</L>
<L>Those secret wayes are, which the Gods do use.</L>
<L>Who would have thought them so? in sum 'tis true</L>
<L>That heaven is a labyrinth, in which</L>
<L>Who seeks to spy out what th' eternal fates</L>
<L>Have there decreed may easily lose himself.</L>
<L>But then I fear least <HI>Celia's</HI> fervent love</L>
<L>Which yet is fuming hot, should still disturb</L>
<L>If not young <HI>Thirsis</HI> with his late quencht heat,</L>
<L>Yet <HI>Phillis</HI> with a jealous freezing cold,</L>
<L>'Tis not a task of easie labour thus</L>
<L>Within an instant to extinguish quite</L>
<L><PB N="113" REF="64">Both love and jealousie.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serp.</SPEAKER>
<L>What is it thou do'st dream? if <HI>Thirsis</HI> be</L>
<L>Son to <HI>Ormino,</HI> must he not then be Brother to <HI>Celia</HI> too?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nar.</SPEAKER>
<L>Forgetfull that I am! these many strange</L>
<L>And unexpected changes, have almost</L>
<L>Depriv'd me of my sence: <HI>Thirsis</HI> it is true</L>
<L>A brother unto <HI>Celia,</HI> and their love</L>
<L>Must now be at an end. But what becomes</L>
<L>Of <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lia</HI> and of <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">yntas</HI> the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">?</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serp.</SPEAKER>
<L>In that same very point of time (behold</L>
<L>A fatal point of time) they came unto</L>
<L>The Temple: Where fair <HI>Celia</HI> sees fast tied</L>
<L>Within the arms of <HI>Phi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">is</HI> her belov'd,</L>
<L>And yet beleeved <HI>Niso,</HI> guess you then</L>
<L>What posture she was in: She straight grew pale</L>
<L>With jealous rage, and cold as any stone</L>
<L>And that she died not then, I think the cause</L>
<L>Was onely that her grief pend up her soul</L>
<L>Within her froze<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> heart.</L>
<L><HI>Thirsis</HI> that saw it&punc; quickly freed himself</L>
<L>From those imbraces wherewithall he held</L>
<L>His <HI>Phillis</HI> in his Arms: And running straight</L>
<L>Unto her said, O my dear <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lia.</HI></L>
<L>My dearest Sister, but no more my love,</L>
<L>I am <HI>Ormino</HI>'s son, <HI>Thirsi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> and so</L>
<L>Become thy brother, our affections er'd</L>
<L>For nature should have guided them, not love,</L>
<L>Let us submit then to a lawfull love,</L>
<L>And spend our erring flames, where they may find</L>
<L>Fit objects for their heat.</L>

<L>Deserve it well, and I am well content</L>
<L>All that did hear him, smil'd, and she that yet</L>
<L>Amaz'd perhaps at such a sudden change</L>
<L><PB N="114" REF="65">Well understood it not, when more at large</L>
<L>And more distinctly she had been inform'd,</L>
<L>Her fancy freed her heart inlightened with</L>

<P>But then what said she?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serp.</SPEAKER>
<L>Nothing but half asham'd she did cast down</L>
<L>Her eyes unto the ground, when yet her heart</L>
<L>Sent through her eyes, two gentle tears that fell</L>
<L>Like tears of joy and gladnesse, to declare</L>
<L>The sweet content she found.</L>
