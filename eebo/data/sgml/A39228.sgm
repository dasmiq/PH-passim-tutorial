<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I have sometime said unto you, so I now write, That there be none on Earth that have so great and eminent a Calling from man to take care of the <HI>Indians,</HI> that they be instructed in the wayes of life by Christ Iesus, as your selves have. For, besides the <HI>Right Honourable Corporation</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> His <HI>Majesty</HI> our Soveraign hath ordered a Trust to be committed to such as shall be in your Order, namely, <HI>Commissioners of the United Co|lonies</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> to take care of this matter. I finde few English Students willing to engage in|to so dim a Work as this is. God hath in mercy raised up sundry among themselves to a competent ability to teach their Countrymen. Many have been sent forth by the Church this Winter to divers places, and not without good success, through the grace of Christ: of which I shall (if God will, and that I live) give you an account at your next
<PB REF="3">
Sitting. I finde it necessary for me to instruct them (as in Principles of Art, so) in the way of communicating the good knowledge of God, which I conceive is most familiarly done by way of <HI>Dia|logues</HI>; an Essay whereunto I do here present unto you: purposing, if the Lord will, and that I live, to do more of the like kinde hereafter. My earnest Request unto your selves, is, That in all your re|spective Colonies you would take care that due Ac|commodation of Lands and Waters may be allowed them, whereon Townships and Churches may be (in after-Ages) able to subsist; and suffer not the English to strip them of all their Lands, in places fit for the Sustenance of the life of man. Thus commending you to the Lord, I rest,</P>

<HEAD>The Preface.</HEAD>
<P>THese <HI>Dialogues</HI> are partly <HI>Historical,</HI> of some things that were done and said; and partly <HI>Instructive,</HI> to shew what might or should have been said, or that may be (by the Lords assistance) here|after done and said, upon the like occasion. It is like to be one work incumbent upon our <HI>Indian</HI> Churches and Teachers, for some Ages, to send forth Instruments to call in others from Paganry to pray unto God: Instructions therefore of that nature are requisite; and what way more familiar, then by way of <HI>Dialogues</HI>? For sundry weighty Reasons I desire and endeavour, that our Learned <HI>Indians</HI> should learn at least the <HI>English Tongue</HI>; our <HI>Indian Churches</HI> holding Communion with the <HI>English Churches,</HI> must perform that Service in the <HI>English Tongue.</HI> If the Lord give life, and length of dayes, I may hereafter put forth these or the like <HI>Dialogues</HI> in the <HI>Indian Tongue</HI>; but what I shall live to do, is known to God. While I live, I desire to follow this Work, and serve the Lord with all my might, according to my poor measure of Ability, and wait upon the Lord for his Blessing, by the concurrent prayers of the faithfull.</P>

<HEAD>Indian Dialogues.</HEAD>
<P>THe Church did send forth sundry of the Brethren to several parts of the Country among their Friends and Relations, to instruct, exhort and perswade them to pray unto God, to turn from their lewd and lazy life to the Living God, and to come forth from the dark dungeon of their lost and ruined condition, into the light of the Lord Jesus, whose glory in the Gospel, like the ri|sing Sun, beginneth to be displayed among their dead Country|men; who begin to be clothed with sinews, flesh and skin upon their dried bones, by the power of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, in the Preaching of the Gospel unto them.</P>

<SPEAKER>Kinsman.</SPEAKER>
<P>WEll met, and welcome beloved Cousin, I am glad you are still alive; can you make shift to live in that new way of living that you have taken up at <HI>Natik</HI>? I am glad of your coming, because I shall thereby have an opportunity to be informed truly of your wayes, and what your doings be, about which there be such various reports, some commending, some con|demning, some deriding, some wondering; but so far as I see few desire to imitate you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pium.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very glad that God hath guided my way so well, so that I should meet you, whom I have longed to see: you are my friend whom I purposed first to look out, and lo God hath order|ed us to meet each other, at my first coming to your Town. Like|wise I am glad that you are so desirous to speak with me about our Religion, and praying to God, for that is the very Errand I come upon, that I might perswade you to do as we do. I am like a friend that have found honey, and plenty of food, and I come to call my friends to come partake with me. But what noise is this that I hear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kinsm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I perceive you have quite left off those delights and solemnities that your Country men use, and which you were in your young time accustomed to, because you have forgot the meaning of such noises. There is a great Dancing, and Sacrifice, and Play, and that is the noise that you hear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pium.</SPEAKER>
<P>You say right, we have indeed quite left off and cast a|way those works of darkness for we have great light shining a|mong us, which discovers the filth and folly of those things; as when a light is set up in a dark room, in a dark night, it discover|eth all the dirty corners of the house, and all the evil actions, that are wont to be done in the dark, without discovery. We plainly see the sinfulness of our own former, and of your still continued wayes; and I desire that God would help me to open among you some of the Divine Light which God hath shewed us, that it may shame you from such filthy practices and shine them away for ever as the rising Sun doth dissipate and drive away all the darkness of the night, and maketh Wolves, Bears, and all other wilde beasts hide themselves in thickets, and not dare to be seen in the day|light.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kinsm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you go with me unto them, and see what they do? I will give you this encouragement to perswade you to it, becaus<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter"> you shall there see many of your friends and kindred.</P>

<P>I cannot serve two Masters: I have undertaken and pro|mised to serve God, and therefore I cannot now go back again and serve the Devil. I have found that Jesus Christ is a good Master, and I come to perswade you to come and be his Servant: Far be it from me that now I am come among you, I should forsake my Ma|ster, and serve the Devil; or that I should so far grieve my Ma|ster, as to go unto those Games which his Soul hateth.</P>
<P>And whereas you say that many of my friends are there, the more is my grief. I desire that I were able to pull you all out of that deep pit and filthy puddle; which to perform, I should ut|terly be disabled, if I should go in my self, and so be d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">filed with the same filth, which I perswade them to forsake and cast away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kinsm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us go unto my house, that you may take there some refreshment of food after your weary journey, and there we shall have liberty to discourse fully of these matters. And while we are in the way, let me ask you of the estate and welfare of our friends and kindred at <HI>Natik</HI>; doth your praying to God exempt you from Sicknesses, Poverty, Nakedness? will praying to God fill you with food, gladness, and garments?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pium.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our friends at <HI>Natik</HI> were when I left them in good state of health, peace and comfort: for which we give God thanks, who is the Father of all mercies.</P>
<P>Touching your question, Whether praying to God doth exempt us from Sicknesses, Poverty, and fills us with food and garments: I answer, If praying to God did bring with it outward plenty and worldly prosperity, then all carnal people would pray to God, not because they love God, or praying to God, but because they love themselves, and love food, clothing, and worldly pleasures; but the benefits of praying are spiritual and heavenly, it teaches us to know God, and the evil of sin; it teacheth us to repent of sin, and seek for pardon, and it teacheth us to forsake sin for ever: and if we are loth to part with sin, God will chastise us with Sick|nesses, Poverty, and other worldly crosses, to call us to repentance, and therefore many times we fare worse in the world, then wicked men do, that thereby we might be weaned from the world, and brought and taught to love and long for heaven. And yet I fur|ther tell you, that Religion doth teach the right way to be rich and prosperons in this world, and many, English especially, have learn|ed that way. For Religion teacheth us to be diligent in labour six dayes, and on the seventh day to rest, and keep it an holy Sabbath; and God hath promised that <HI>the diligent hand shall make rich:</HI> and when we walk with God in godliness and obedience, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e will give us the blessing of this life, so far as is best for us, he will withhold no good thing from us; if any thing be withheld from us, or ta|ken away from us, it is because it is not good for us: Our Father better knoweth what is good for us, then we our selves know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="5">
<SPEAKER>Kinsm.</SPEAKER>
<P>If your praying to God do indeed teach you the true way of being rich, as you say, how then cometh it to pass that you are so poor still? for you have prayed to God these twenty years and more, and I do not see that you have increased in riches ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> much, you are still poor: where be your Riches? where be you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> flocks and herds of Cattel? where be your Clothes? what grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Houses have you built? where be your fields of Corn, Barns an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Orchards? Alas, you are not like the English; and therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> doubt upon this point, it is not as you say, that praying to Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> teacheth you the right way to be rich.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pium.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is one of the least, the last, the lowest of those things that our Religion teacheth us. There be two sorts of riches; Earthly riches, of which onely you speak, and Heavenly riches, which Gods Word calleth true riches. These Earthly riches are but temporary, and shall soon perish, but the true riches are hea|venly, and eternal, they last for ever. And we have spent these twenty Years in seeking chiefly after heavenly riches, for so God commandeth us in his Word, <HI>Seek first the Kingdome of Heaven,</HI> as for these earthly riches <HI>they shall be added to you,</HI> so much as you need. And the Word of God commandeth us to <HI>be content if we have food and clothes</HI>; Now we have food and clothes more then we were wont to have before we prayed to God, and we have con|tented our selves therewith, and have bent our mindes more to look after heavenly riches, and in those things we have increased more, then in earthly riches.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kinsm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pray tell me what are those heavenly riches of which you speak so highly, and upon which you do bestow your chief care and pains, and so much prefer before earthly riches, which we ac|count so much of, and think to be the best things attainable in this world?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pium.</SPEAKER>
<P>The true riches which we spend our time to seek after, are,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The knowledge of the great God, who hath made this vast World, and governeth the same by his Wisdome and Power, and who hath made Man, and governeth us by his holy Laws and Commandments.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The knowledge of our selves, to be miserable sinners, and do daily o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fend and sin against God, provoking his wrath against us, to pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> for our transgressions against his holy Laws and Com|mandments.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The knowledge of Jesus Christ, the Redeemer of the world, who hath in unspeakable love took a course to deliver us from the wrath of God&punc; for whereas we have by our sins deserved Death &amp; Damn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion Christ became a Man, and died for us, and thereby hath pacified the Justice and Wrath of God, and opened a way of Salvation for us, obtaining a Pardon for us, and offering grace unto us, whereby we may be saved, and be brought to eternal glory and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">appines<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="5" REF="5">4. The knowledge of the grace of God in Jesus Christ, whereby he bringeth us to repent of our sins, to convert and turn from all our evil wayes, and to believe in the Lord Jesus, and to walk with God in the wayes of holiness and righteousness before him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The knowledge of the Means of grace, the Ordinances of God; whereby we walk with God in wayes of Civil Government, in wayes of Justice, and good Order. And in the Ordinances of Worshipping God, in the sanctifying of the Sabbaths, and walking in the Communion of Saints, by the Word of God, and Prayer, and Singing of Psalms.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. In the knowledge of the estate of all men after death; how the godly men that penitently believe in Christ, go to Heaven when they die; and the wicked, that refuse to repent and believe, they go to Hell, and there abide till the Day of Judgement: at which day or time, when it cometh, all men shall rise again, and be judged according to their deeds in this life; and then shall the godly go with Christ to eternal Glory, and the wicked shall be cast into Hell Soul and Body, and there be tormented with the Devils for ever.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kinsm.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are great and strange things you speak of, I un|derstand them not, but yet me&punc; thinks there is a majesty and glory in them. I am amazed at what you say, though I do not under|stand them distinctly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pium.</SPEAKER>
<P>You see then that we are grown rich with Riches that are above your capacity; and these are the <HI>true Riches,</HI> and about these things we spend most of our time. And as for these world|ly Riches, we less regard them, as being poor, low, little, small, contemptible things, in comparison of those heavenly riches about which we spend our time; and in which we have increased and gained, by Gods grace in Christ, so much as doth make you admire at us, though we know but little of what is to be known, but you cannot perceive the glory and excellency thereof.</P>
<P>And indeed it is the wisdome and love of God unto us, that setteth us rather to grow in these riches, which the eyes of world|ly men cannot see, then to grow rich in earthly and worldly riches, which the carnal world can see: because if we should abound in earthly riches, we should be thronged with multitudes of carnal persons, who love the world, and love not God, who would be a cumber and temptation to us. And it is a sign that our wayes are good and godly, and above the world, because so few (in compa|rison) come unto us, but rather fly from us; because they love to live in wayes and deeds of darkness, and hate the light and glory that is in our wayes. But I pray Cousin whose house is that before us, where I see so many going in and out, and standing about in every place?</P>

<P>And I pray Cousin how doth your Wife, my loving Kinswoman, is she yet living? and is she not yet weary of your new way of praying to God? And what pleasure have you in those wayes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pium.</SPEAKER>
<P>My wife doth remember her love to you, she is in good health of body, and her Soul is in a good condition, she is entred into the light of the knowledge of God, and of Christ; she is en|tred into the narrow way of heavenly joyes, and she doth greatly desire that you would turn from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">se wayes of darkness in which you so much delight, and come taste and see how good the Lord is.</P>
<P>And whereas you wish I had come sooner, to have shared with you in your delights of this day; Alas, they are no delights, but griefs to me, to see that you do still delight in them. I am like a man that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve tasted of sweet Win&eacute; and Honey, which h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve so al|tered the taste of my mouth, that I abhor to taste of your sinful and foolish pleasures, as the mouth doth abhor to taste the most filthy and stinking dung, the most sowre grapes, or most bitter gall. Our joyes in the knowledge of God, and of Jesus Christ, which we are taught in the Book of God, and feel in our heart, is sweeter to our soul, then honey is unto the mouth and taste.</P>

<P>We have all the delights that the flesh and blood of man can devise and delight in, and we taste and feel the delights of them, and would you make us believe that you have found out new joyes and delights, in comparison of which all our delights do stink like dung; would you make us believe that we have neither eyes to see, nor ears to hear, nor mouthes to taste? <HI>Ha, ha he!</HI> I appeal to the sense and sight and feeling of the Compa|ny present, whether this be so.</P>

<P>Hearken to me, my friends, and see if I do not give a clear answer unto this seeming difficulty. Your dogs take as much delight in these Meetings, and the same kindes of delight as you
<PB N="7" REF="6">
do; they delight in each others company; they provoke each o|ther to lust, and enjoy the pleasures of lust as you do; they eat and play and sleep as you do&punc; what joyes have you more then d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gs have? to delight the body of f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">h and blood.</P>
<P>But all mankinde have an higher and better part then the body, we have a Soul, and that Soul shall never die: Our Soul is to converse with G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, and to converse in such things as do concern G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, and Heaven, and an etern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l estate, either in happiness with God, if we walk with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">im and serve him in this life, or in misery a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d torment with the Devil, if we serve him in this life. The service of God doth con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">st in Virtue, and Wisdome, and delights of the Soul, which will reach to Heaven, and abide for ever.</P>
<P>But the service of the Devil is in com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itting sins of the flesh, which defile both body and soul, and reach to Hell, and will turn all to fire and flame to torment your souls and bodies to all eter|nity.</P>
<P>Now consider, all your pleasures and delights are such as defile you with sin, and will turn to flame, to burn and torment you; they provoke God to wrath, who hath created the Prison of Hell to torment you, and the more you have took pleasur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in sin, the greater are your offences against God, and the greater shall be your torments.</P>
<P>But we that pray to G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d repent of our old sins, and by f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ith in Christ we seek for, and finde a pardon of what is past, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d grace and strength to reform for time to come.

<P>If these things be so, we had need cease laughing, and fall to weeping, and see if we can draw water from our mournful eyes to quench these tormenting flames.

<P>The Book of God is no invention of English-men, it is the holy Law of God himself, which was given unto man by God, be|fore English-men had any knowledge of God; and all the know|ledge which they have, they have it out of the Book of God: and this Book is given to us as well as to them, and it is as free for us to search the Scriptures as for them. So that we have our instru|ction from an higher hand, then the hand of man: it is the great Lord God of Heaven and Earth, who teacheth us these great things of which we speak. Yet this is also true, that we have great cause to be thankful to the English, and to thank God for them, for they had a good Country of their own, but by Ships sailing into these parts of the World, they heard of us, and of our Country, and of our nakedness, ignorance of God, and wilde condition; God put it into their hearts to desire to come hither, and teach us the good knowledge of God; and their King gave them leave so to do, and in our Country to have their liber|ty to serve God accordi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g to the Word of God.

<P>Now my Kinsmen and Friends let us discourse a little about the Question propounded, <HI>Why we pray unto God before and after Meat</HI>? Our Lord Jesus Christ did so before meat, as it is written of him in many examples; and we are not to doubt but he did the same after meat, because the Lord hath commanded the same so expresly, saying, <HI>When thou hast eaten and art full, then be|ware lest thou forget the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>And to shew you what great reason we have thus to do, consider that God doth some of his chief works in this world, in the matter of our eating, which no creature can do: for take you a Tray of meat, and ask, Who can turn this into blood, and flesh, and si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ew<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and bones, and skin? and who can give every part of our bo|dy its due proportion, that one part sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll not overgrow the other, but every part alike? Who but God can do this? And
<PB N="12" REF="9">
who but God can make our bodies to grow to such an appointe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> stature, and then to grow no more? And who but God can pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">serve our health, and turn away sicknesses? Now these marvello<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hings God doth for us every day, and every time we eat, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> therefore is it not very good reason that we should pray and giv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> thanks to God at such time as he doth such great and obligi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> things for us?</P>
<P>Again, God provideth all our food for us; he provideth Cor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; not we our selves, we do but a little towards it, the great work <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Gods: all that we do is to put our Corn into the ground, and k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> the ground clean about it, but God makes it to grow, he gives <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a root, a blade, a stalk, and ears, whereby one Corn shall becom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> three or four or five hundred. Who but God can do this? there<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fore Corn is of his providing.</P>
<P>Again, who provideth water, and watereth the Corn? is it no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> God? for when Springs and Rivers are dried up, what can me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> do, but cry to God? and the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> God will bring Clouds, like grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Bottles full of water, and drop them down upon the withered an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> parched Earth, and thereby make the Corn and Grass, and all frui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to grow.

<P>Again, God provides Flesh for us to feed upon, for he maket<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the grass and herbs to grow, and when the beasts do feed thereo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he doth turn those Leaves into blood, flesh, sinews and bones; an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> this he giveth us for food, and turneth it into blood, flesh, sine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and bones in us.

<ITEM>1. VVe must give God thanks for all the mercies we have re|ceived all the day, which are more then the moments of the time that we live.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. VVe must pray for Gods protection of us when we are asleep, we lye like so many dead men, and how easily might mischief be|fall us, either by Fire, or by an Enemy, if God did not defend and keep us; but when God is our keeper we may rest quietly, in safe|ty without fear, under the covert of his hand: and by faith in Gods protection we sleep quietly without fear, whereas you that do not pray, nor believe, nor commit your selves to God, you do alwayes sleep in fear and terrour.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Moreover, our sleep and rest is a great reparation of our strength and spirits, and preservation of our health. VVhile we sleep our food is boiled up within us, and digested into all parts of our body, and new spirits are extracted out of our food, and sent up both to our head, heart, and all parts of our body, so that we are fresh and strong in the morning after a good nights rest. Now all this is the special work of God, beyond the power and skill of man to perform for us, and therefore it is great reason to pray for this blessing when we go to rest.</ITEM>

<P>By the mercy of God through Jesus Christ, I am every way well refreshed. The comfort of my Soul doth make my bo|dily infirmities inconsiderable. And that which addeth much to the comfort of my Soul, is the good attention which you and some other of our friends gave unto our disconrse and prayers the last night, which giveth me hope <HI>that you are not far from the Kingdome of God.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kinsm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess my thoughts have troubled me this night, I have a great strife in my heart, I think your way is right, I cannot gainsay any thing of which you discoursed: but on the other side, if I should forsake our former wayes, all my friends would rise up against me like a stream too strong for me to stand against, and I am not able to defend my self against them; I do not know what to do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pium.</SPEAKER>
<P>God is above man. VVhen I began to pray to God, I had the same temptation, but I quickly found how vain and weak it was; God will defend all his servants against all gainsayers: the light and power of Gods word and wayes will soon shame all sin|ners into silence.</P>
<P>But I will tell you a further help in this case: VVe shall endea|vour to convince and perswade all your friends to turn unto God also, and then that Temptation will quite sink. Let us therefore get your Friends and Neighbours together, and labour to perswade them all first to hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the word of God preached among you, and my hope is that God will perswade so many of them, as that the rest will be ashamed to oppose; for darkness and sin are weak, Truth and Light are powerful.</P>

Tear our hair from our heads, our skin from our flesh, our flesh from our bones, you shall as soon perswade us to suffer you to do so by us, as to perswade us to part with our old delights and courses. You tell us of the English-man's God, and of his Laws: We have Gods also, and more then they; and we have Laws also by which our forefathers did walk, and why should not we do as they have done? To change our Gods, and Laws, and Customs, are great things, and not easily to be obtained and ac|complished.

<P>You have spoken many things, which do minister matter to me of much discourse, both concerning God, and our selves, and concerning you, &amp; the offer of Gods mercy to you at this time. You say you have many Gods, but they are no Gods. There is but one God, the great Creator of this great World. Did your Gods make this World? the Heavens, the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, the Clouds, the Seas, and the whole Earth? No, no; God made this whole world. Can any of your gods give Rain, or rule the Clouds? it is the Devil that blindeth your eyes, and covereth you with darkness. We teach you to know the true God, who can kill us, or keep us alive at his pleasure. Your gods shall all perish with you, for they are no gods.</P>
<P>As for your pleasures and delights, they are all sins against God, which provoke his wrath to plague you for ever. VVe now call you to repent of your evil wayes, and to reform your lives to serve the true and living God, to seek for pardon of your sins, and mer|cy to appease his wrath which is kindled against you.

I am ashamed of my old wayes, and loth I am to keep that which I am ashamed to be seen in. The wi|ser men be, the more they abstain from such lusts, and we account such to be foolish, vile and wicked, that are unbridled and un|persw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">deable.

<P>What Book is that you reade in? and why do you call it <HI>The Word of God</HI>?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pium.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is the Book of Gods Law, which he hath taught holy men his Prophets and Apostles to write, and give unto us, to call us out of the broad way of sin and death, and to call us into the narrow way of Repentance, Faith in Christ Jesus, and eternal life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sont.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be the English-men made it, and tell you that they are the words of God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pium.</SPEAKER>
<P>This Book was written long before the English-men pray|ed to God, and English-men have learned all their wisdome out of this Book, and now they have Translated it for us, and if we attend unto it, it will teach us wisdome, as it hath taught them.</P>

<P>You speak much of Jesus Christ, and his pardoning our sins, and saving our Souls; who is this Jesus Christ?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pium.</SPEAKER>
<P>God is One in Three; the <HI>Father, Son,</HI> and <HI>Holy Ghost.</HI> Jesus Christ is God the Son, who became a Man; and when we de|served to die for our sins, he came and died for us: and God hath promised that all that believe in Christ shall be pardoned of all their sins, and be glorified in heaven.</P>
<P>Touching this Point I will teach in the Afternoon.</P>

<P>GOD requires we should give him a whole day, there|fore it is not enough to worship God half a day. We are again come together to worship God, and we shall do the same this Afternoon, as we did in the Forenoon. Let us pray.</P>
<P>After Prayer, he taketh this Text; <HI>Mat.</HI> 1.21, 22, 23.</P>
<P>This Text teacheth three things touching Jesus Christ,</P>
</SP>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. His wonderful Birth; <HI>A Virgin conceived.</HI> Of which, see
<HI>Luke</HI> 1.26, to 39.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Two Names; <HI>Iesus, Emmanuel.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. What Christ did for us, and doth, signified by his Name <HI>Ie|sus; He taketh away our sins.</HI> And this he doth two wayes:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. He taketh away our sins out of Gods sight, by dying in our stead, and so meriting a pardon for all our sins.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="24" REF="15">2. He taketh away our sins out of our own hearts, by working Repentance in us, and Faith in his Name, giving us his Spirit, and sanctifying of us by his Grace, and leading us in all holiness of life and conversation.</ITEM>
</LIST></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The third part of this Text is, how Jesus Christ is enabled to do these great things for us. This signified by his second Name, <HI>God with us.</HI></P>
<P>Christ was God and Man in one Person; and that maketh his death of infinite value with God, to obtain a pardon for all our sins.</P>
<P>And this maketh him of infinite power to overcome our hearts, and turn them unto God.</P>
<P>These things are deep wisdome; therefore pray unto God, and he will give you wisdome to understand them, <HI>Iam.</HI> 1.5.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kinsm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am amazed to hear these deep things: I am now more discouraged about praying to God. Alas, we cannot Pray, nor Reade, how shall we keep a Sabbath? and whall s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">all we do?</P>

<P>Ha! you and I are both alike in sundry things, I wish we might be both alike in one thing more.

<P>Ha, ha, he.

<P>You judge ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ht touching my opinion of that thing which I have not mentioned, but I doubt that you will not be of my minde if I should speak it, and for that reason I did conceal it. Wise men will cover a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d hide their Jewels, and not expose them to every bodies sight, for they know some will lightly esteem them, because they know not their worth: but if they fall in company with such as know the worth of their Jewel, they will be content to let them see it, and take a full view of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your discourse doth the more inflame my desire to know what this matter is that is so precious in your eyes and so doubt|ful to finde esteem with me. I confess I am foolish, but I hope you shall finde me one that would be wise, and love the company of the wise, and willing to learn of others that wisdome which I want; and therefore though I desire not to know other mens se|crets, yet if this other matter you intimate be such as I may know, my desire is raised high to know it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your words are good and wise, and give me hopes that what I have further to say unto you, will finde acceptance with you according to my desire. I will therefore open to you the truth of the matter. I am a <HI>praying Indian,</HI> I have left our old <HI>Indian</HI> Customs, Laws, Fashions, Lusts, Pauwauings, and whatever else is contrary to the right knowledge of the true God, and of Jesus Christ our Redeemer. It repenteth me of all my fore-past life, the lusts, vanities, pleasures, and carnal delights that were formerly very sweet and delightful to me, are now bitter as gall unto me, I hate and loath them. All the works of darkness in which I was wont to take pleasure, I do now forsake and abandon. I am come into the light, I now see things as they are indeed, and nor as they seemed to be in the dark. I now know the VVord of God, which sheweth me the way of eternal Life. I now know God who made all the world, against whom mankinde are turned re|bels and sinners. I know the Law of God which I have broken, and by my sins I have deserved eternal damnation in the world that is to come. I now know Jesus Christ, who hath died for us, to
<PB N="26" REF="16">
procure a pardon for us, and to open a door and way to eternal life and salvation for us. Into this way I have entred, herein I walk, and I have promised to God, that I will live and walk in this way all the dayes of my life.</P>
<P>And not onely so, but my desire is to perswade all others into the same way which I have entred, because I do certainly and ex|perimentally know that my former wayes were darkness, sin, and led unto hell and damnation; and this way whereinto I am now entred, is a way of light, life, holiness, peace, and eternal salva|tion: therefore do I earnestly perswade all that I meet with to be wise, and turn from the wayes of darkness, and come into this way of light and glory. And this is the thing which I did mean, when I said, <HI>that there is another thing wherein I wish that we may be alike.</HI> I do therefore exhort and intreat you that you would do as I have done, forsake your old wayes of sin, of which you have cause to be ashamed, and turn unto God, call on God, be numbred among the <HI>praying Indians.</HI></P>

<P>Of God, know his Greatness, Goodness, VVisdome, and Powe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> He hath made all things in this great world; all things above <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> are his works, he made the Heavens, the Sun, Moon, Stars, Cloud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

damnation: and all this God did in six days; so great is God above man. The Law which he gave to man is holy, just and good: but man by the temptation of evil Angels, who by their sin became to be Devils, I say man broke the Law which God gave him, and sin|ned against God, turned Rebel against God, and served the Devil: and in this rebellion all the children of men go on to this day.</P>
<P>Gods Law is in Ten Commandments, wherein he requireth of man to know and worship God, fear his Name, and keep his Sab|baths; and other Laws forbid Lust, Murther, Stealing, and all other evils. Moreover, God hath annexed unto his Law a great Promise, <HI>Do and live,</HI> with a just Punishment, <HI>Sin and die</HI> eternally; namely, that all the breakers of this Law, and sinners against him, shall be punished in hell fire with eternal torments. And this is the condition of all mankinde, and it is our estate, that by our sins against God we have deserved to die, and then to be cast away down into hell fire, to be tormented among the Devils, who tempt|ed us to sin, and whom we have served in our life time: now toge|ther with them we must be tormented for ever.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh you have now killed me again: By the first light you shewed me, I thought you had made me alive, and I joyed in the light, but I understood it not. Now your light is become a sword, it hath pierced through my heart, by it I now see I am a dead man. Alas, I have been a sinner all my dayes, I am guilty of more sins then I have lived dayes, many sins in a day have I committed: Night and day have I offended God, and broke his Law. I have served the Devil and not God, I have done nothing that God com|mandeth, I have only served the Devil, and committed sin; there|fore I have deserved to be damned in hell, and to be tormented among the Devils for ever, whom in this life I have served with so much delight; And now poor miserable I, what shall I do? These Trees under whose shade we sit, why fall they not upon me and crush this rebellious worm in pieces, and send me away to the place of eternal torment? These Rocks and hills about us, why fall they not upon me and break me into dust and powder, and send me away unto perdition? will God regard these complaints of mine? what are these tears of mine? can they quench hell fire? nay, will they not rather be oyle unto those flames? I am in mi|sery, help I can finde none; the greatness of Gods Majesty and power, against whom I a finite poor worm have sinned, doth most amaze me. I pray help me further to understand the great majesty of God.</P>

God <HI>conceiving</HI> is the Father: God <HI>conceived</HI> is the Son; this intellectual act of <HI>conceiving,</HI> is called Begetting: God <HI>con|ceiving,</HI> and God <HI>conceived,</HI> by an infinite act of volition, lov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">h himself; and this <HI>Love</HI> is the holy Ghost, proceeding from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Fa|ther and the Son. God as he is Father hath made all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ings, and given man a Law. God in the dispensation of the Covenant of Works hath agreed within himself that the Son of God should as|sume unto himself an humane Nature, which is subject unto the Law of God. This glorious Person is God and Man in one Per|son, named <HI>Iesus Christ.</HI> This glorious Person Jesus Christ, is a Person of more worth then all Mankinde beside. This glorious Person Jesus Christ came into this world, and offered to God by Covenant his own life in our stead, and died for us to satisfie divine Justice for the sin of man: with this Sacrifice God hath said he is
<PB N="30" REF="18">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">atisfied for the sin of man. Thus Jesus Christ hath honoured Gods Law, by s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tisfying of divine Justice, and now Jesus Christ hath power to pardon whom he will.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are strange and deep things which you say: in this way I do see that a person is found that is able to pay a ransome to God, and satisfie his Justice. But still I am in the dark about my self, how shall I be inter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sted in this Redemption wrought by Je|sus Christ? If you have obtained it, I have some hope that so may I. I pray tell me how I may be m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">de partaker of this great Redemption, from the condemnation of sin pronounced against me by the Law of God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>According to my poor ability, as well as I can I will tell you, and I will tell you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow I have obtained it, and in the same way you also may obtain it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>O how this hope, by your experience, beginneth to raise my heart. I pray go on and declare it to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>God hath made a new Covenant of grace which he hath opened in the Gospel, and Jesus Christ hath published it to all the world: and the sum of it is this; That whosoever shall penitently turn from sin towards God, and believe in Jesus Christ, he shall have a pardon of all his sins, and be partaker of eternal life, through the grace and mercy of God in Jesus Christ. <HI>Iohn</HI> 3.16. <HI>God so loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Son, that who|soever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">elieveth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>This puts me into another great difficulty: can I penitent|ly turn from sin, and believe in Jesus Christ? Alas, I know not how to go about such a work, much less do I know how to accom|plish the same; therefore I still am under great straights, and know not what to do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>You say true, it is a work past your ability to do: But Jesus Christ hath undert<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ken two great works in the salvation of sinners. The first is to pacifie Gods Justice, and satisfie the Law, and to reconcile God toward us; and that he hath done and finish|ed effectually, when he was here on earth. 2. Christ hath under|taken to conquer the world of all Gods Elect (for it is onely the Elect of God whom Christ hath undertaken for) and the Father and the Son have sent forth God the holy Ghost to effect this work: for none but God himself is able to convert <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Soul, and create faith in the heart of man. We cannot do it of our selves, neither you nor I can do it, but by the assistance of the Spirit of God, by the Word of God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Still the difficulty lyeth before me, I am at a loss, and know not what to do. I fully believe I am not able to do it my self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will help you as well as I can; and the Lord help you by his Word and Spirit. Your heart is now (in some measure) al|ready
<PB N="31" REF="18">
turned away from sin; that part of the work is wrought in your heart, which I will demonstrate to you thus: I ask you, will you hereafter live and walk in the wayes of sin as you have former|ly done?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh no, no: I hope God will keep me and help me; I will never live again as I have f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">merly done, I will binde my self from it. I abhor to do so, I will forsake them for ever: Lord help me so to do</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; therefore you are now converted from your sins: and who wrought this great Change in you? it was not your self did it, nor was it I that did it; I onely opened unto you the word of God, but the Spirit of God, by the conviction of the Law, and by the word of God, hath wrought this work in you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot gainsay you, I yield to what you say, and wonder at it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me manner the Spirit of God by the word is able to cre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">te Faith in you to believe in Jesus Christ. This work the Lord useth to work in us by the Promises of the Gospel. Now I will propound unto you at present but one Promise, <HI>Mat.</HI> 11.28, 29. <HI>Come unto me all ye that la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">our, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall finde rest unto your souls.</HI> Now I ask you, Are you weary and heavy laden with your sins?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh yes, God knows I am so; I never f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lt the like distress in my Soul since I was born, sin is the bitterest thing in the world to my Soul.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then hearken to this call of Christ, for he calls you in particular to come to him, and this coming is believing: are you willing to come to Christ, and ask a pardon of him, and beg his mercy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yea, with all my heart. Lord help me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then see the next words, what he promises, <HI>I will give you rest.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh Lord let it be so, according to thy Word and Promise, thy will be done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, wait here, and see if God doth not quiet your Soul, and give you rest. Mean while I will further ask you in the next words, Are you willing to take upon you Christ his yoke, and this yoke consisteth of two parts: 1. The yoke of Commandments, to do whatever he commandeth. And 2. his yoke of Sufferings in this world for his Name sake: for now that you are converted, the carnal world will hate you, mock you, injure you, speak all evil against you, and it may be if they can they will kill you, as they did Christ; but are you willing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">er all for Jesus Christ his sake, who hath died for you? And further, are you willing to learn meekness of Jesus Christ? For they are the next words; and I
<PB N="32" REF="19">
do assure you, that you will have great need of patience, when you have done all the duties he commands, to suffer patiently what God himself shall inflict upon you by sicknesses, crosses and tempta|tions, or what wicked men shall inflict upon you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>These things which you speak are against the flesh and f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e that I used to be in; and I do finde that they are not so fully kil|led, but that they have a little stirring in them when you propound these cases to me.</P>
<P>But the experience I have now found of the love of God, and of Jesus Christ to my Soul, doth lay such an engagement upon my heart, that I will, by his grace and assistance, be for him onely, serve him onely, do all that ever he shall command me, suffer whatever he shall impose upon me; I will no more be for my self, but for him, who hath done all this for me. Oh what shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits to my poor Soul!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are surprized by the night, we must rest under these Trees this night. I do account this day well spent, though we have made but little progress toward the place of our intendment: but I have been about the work I came abroad upon, though not the persons I intended. Thus God doth over-rule the wayes of men; he foreseeth and ordereth that which we had no thoughts upon: and therefore in that we have spent this day in such Con|ference and Discourse, wherein we have seen so much of the pre|sence of Christ with us; let us now spend this night in prayers and praises unto the Lord, who hath found us before we sought for him. You were going about another business, you little thought of find|ing Jesus Christ by the way, and finding mercy to your Soul, a par|don of your sins, and to become a <HI>praying Indian.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your discourse doth heighten my admiration. I acknow|ledge God hath thought of me when I thought not of him; he had a care of my Soul when I had no care of my self; God hath pluck|ed me out of darkness, and brought me into a most wonderful light, that I should be forced to see the wonderful things of Gods Law, &amp; of my eternal condemnation by it, my helpless and hopeless condition that I was in.</P>
<P>And then, that the Lord should open unto me a possibility of escape, that a ransome and remedy might be found by the infinite wisdome and mercy of God; and that Jesus Christ had not onely accomplished that great work, but offered the fruit and benefit of it to me, and called me to rest in him, and to betrust my Soul with him, for pardon of all my sins, and for eternal life in Jesus Christ. These things are matter of my admiration, and shall be to all eter|nity. My life remaining shall be spent in admiring, and in obeying and suffering, as you have now taught me; I shall account nothing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oo dear for Christ, who hath not accounted his own most precious life too dear for me. Whereas I am now instructed, that he being
<PB N="33" REF="19">
God and Man in one person, his life was of more value then all the lives of all mankinde; and that he did not forbear to offer that precious life for me; I must, I will, by his grace assisting, admire at this mercy for ever: and therefore the motion that you made of spending this night in prayer and praises unto his holy Name, it is a most acceptable motion to my heart. My experience suggest|eth unto me matter abundantly to pray and praise his Name, but my ignorance is such as that I ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">not tell how to utter my minde in words of knowledge suitable unto so great mercies as I have now experienced.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your discourse doth lead me out to inform you in a great point of the grace and kingdome of Jesus Christ, and that is the gift and grace of Prayer, which the Spirit of Jesus Christ teach|eth every new born Soul to perform: for so the Scripture saith, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.15. <HI>He hath given the Spirit of his Son, whereby we cry,</HI> and crying is an earnest manner of praying; and the matter of our cry is to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y <HI>Abba, Father,</HI> that is, to call God our Father, and to ask him a Childes portion in the Name of Jesus Christ, as he hath pro|mised, that whatever we ask in the Name of Jesus Christ, it shall be surely granted, either the same thing or a better; for we are foolish children, and know not what is best for our selves, but our Father doth: and therefore when we make our prayers and request to God, we must leave the matter to his love &amp; wisdome, to give us what, and when, and how he will.</P>
<P>And because we are ignorant what to pray for, therefore the Spi|rit of God who dwelleth in our heart, he is called the <HI>Spirit of Grace and of Supplication</HI>; and <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.26, 27. <HI>Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit it self maketh intercession for us with groanings, which cannot be uttered. And he that searcheth the hearts, knoweth what is the minde of the Spirit, because he maketh interces|sion for the Saints, according to the will of God.</HI> Where we see that our weakness is supplied by the assistance of the Spirit, and he help|eth us to pray for such things as please God; and in such a manner as pleaseth God. And this is the condition of every true convert|ed believer, that he can pray, and desires to pray, and is ever lift|ing up his heart to G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d in prayer: and therefore I like it well that my motion of spending this night in prayer, is so acceptable to you, a good sign it is that the Spirit of Jesus Christ hath taken possession of your Soul.</P>

<P>This little sight and experience I have, hath so filled my heart with a sense of my own vileness, that I see matter of endless confession; and I see so much nothingness in my self, that I see end|less matter of petition and supplication; and I see my self so in|finitely obliged to God for the riches of his free-grace to me a re|bellious worm, that I see infinite matter of praise, thanksgiving

<P>Our state in this world is not perfect, corruption is killed but in part; there be old roots remaining, which upon occasio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> offered will still be stirring, acting, appearing, as a tree that is cut down, the old roots will be growing, which must be kept dow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with a speedy cutting off.

<SP>
<PB N="35" REF="20">
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>The night spent in prayer hath let me finde a sweet taste in it, though I do already finde that it is a weariness to my flesh. I thank you for this Counsel, I desire I may remember and do it. What further Counsel will you give me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must be much conversant in the Word of God, and though you cannot yet reade the Word, yet you must get the help of others, and learn the word of God by heart; and you must meditate upon the same night and day, for so <HI>David</HI> did, Psal. 1.2. And the meditation on the Word will sanctifie the heart, and kill corruption, and will mightily help you to subdue it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt it will be difficult for me to learn to reade, I am dull of capacity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>A strong desire, diligence and constancy, will obtain any thing: and you must pray God to teach you, and to open your heart to learn: <HI>Iam.</HI> 1.5. <HI>If any of you lack wisdome, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">raideth not, and it shall be given him.</HI> And for a further help to you, my fourth Counsel is, That you diligently learn the Catechize, and by learning to reade that, you will learn to reade and understand the whole Bible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see my self very ignorant, and therefore I am very desi|rous to learn Catechism, because I have heard and do perceive that is the foundation of all knowledge in Religio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, being wisely gathered out of the Scripture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>You say right about Catechism; we do therefore teach it our Children, that the principles of good knowledge may be sown and rooted in them from a Childe: and for that reason also do we send them to School, to learn to reade the Word of God, that they may be acquainted with the Word from a Childe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh what a loss is this to me, that I am to begin to learn Catechize and the Word of God now I am a man, which I might have been acquainted with from a Childe, had I been brought up among the <HI>praying Indians.</HI> How happy are your Children that are thus brought up. I suppose you are very diligent in this matter in Training up of your Children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have great cause to judge our selves for too much negligence in this point. A fifth Counsel I give you is, That you be constant and diligent in the exercise of the Worship of God in your Family, in these points: 1. You must Morning and Even|ing pray in your Family, and teach them in Catechism, and read|ing of the Scriptures. 2. Alwayes before and after Meat you must pray and give thanks to God.</P>

<SPEAKER>Waban.</SPEAKER>
<P>MY aged Uncle, I am glad that it hath pleased God once more to give me an opportunity to see you alive in this world. It is not unknown unto you, that I and many others have undertaken a new way of life, which is known to many by the name of <HI>Praying to God.</HI> The way that I formerly, and you still live in, is a way o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> worshipping the Devil, it is a way of dark|ness and sin: and though it is a way pleasant and easie to the flesh, yet it leadeth to destruction and eternal torments. Man is made for another life after this life is ended; and though our body dieth and turneth to dust, yet the Soul is immortal, it dieth not, but at the death of the body it departeth to a place of eternal being, either in glory, or in misery. If we pray to God with a right <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eart, peniten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly turn from sin to God, and believe in Jesus Christ, then we shall have a pardon granted us, and eternal happiness with Jesus Christ, But if we do not turn to God, but worship and serve the Devil, and walk in the wayes of sin, then at death our Soul must be dragged to hell, and there tormented for ever among the Devils, whom we have obeyed and served in this life. These&punc; things, and many more, we do perfectly know, and believe to be true by the Word of God, which is the Sun-light of the Soul, even as the Sun is the great light of the outward world.</P>
<P>God hath put it into my heart to desire that your Soul might be ble<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed for ever; and the Church hath sent me, and I come in the Name of Jesus Christ to tell you these things, and beseech you to turn from these vain and evil wayes, and to believe in Jesus Christ, that your sins may be pardoned, and that your Soul may be saved in eternal glory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nish.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your love and desire of my good, I have no reason but, to accept with kindness; but me thinks one thing in your discourse is doubtful. We see with our eyes, and know certainly that the
<PB N="37" REF="21">
body dieth, and turneth to rottenness and dust, and why may not the Soul d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> so likewise? we see not what becometh of it, and to make such a stir, and change our course upon uncertainties, I have no liking to it, my Age inclineth me rather to be quiet, and not meddle with such un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">een intricacies, fitter for younger heads to minde.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our bodies are the product of the seed of man, and that is made out of the food we eat, and our food grows out of the earth, so that our bodies are made of refined earth; and there|fore at death turn to earth again, out of which it was made, and so God speaketh, <HI>Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return.</HI> But the Soul is not so; it is a Spirit, of a purer nature then earthly things, and it is immediately created by God, and therefore dieth not. Besides, we are assured by many infallible proofs out of the Word of God, and by evidence of good Reason, that the Soul is immortal, which point we are taught in our Catechism. And not onely so, but God hath taught us, that at the end of the world the body shall be raised again out of the dust, and the Soul and body joyned together again, and then the person shall be judged by Jesus Christ, according to their deeds done in the flesh: those that live and die in their sins, shall be turned into hell, to be torment|ed by and with the Devils; but they that turn to God, and believe in Jesus Christ, shall be judged to go with Christ to heaven, and be ever with him in eternal glory.</P>
<P>Therefore this consideration doth more sharpen my request and intreaties of you, how shall I endure to see this body of yours, which I so respect and love, and that Soul of yours also, to go a|way unto eternal torments. And I pray you consider what a wound and torment i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> will then be, to remember, I was exhorted and intreated to turn to God and live; mercy in Christ was offer|ed me, but I refused it: and therefore deservedly do you lose what you refused, and deservedly you suffer that torment you did choose, rather then to trouble your self with this business of pray|ing to God, and believing in Jesus Christ.</P>

and good Law, in Ten Commandments, under the order of a Co|venant of Works, and if he kept and obeyed this Law, he should live in glory and happiness for ever, but if he did break this Law, and sin against God, that great Majesty of heaven, then he should be answerably and justly pun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">hed with eternal torments in hell fire, with the Devil and his Angels for evermore: and this L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w was for himself and all his posterity, in whose stead he sto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d as a publick person.</P>

I d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rst not pray God to pardon my transgression, by any absolute soveraign act of mercy, for then he should have of|fended his own Justice, which is unchangeable, and abolished his own Law, whose perfection is such that it must be fulfilled and sa|tisfied; and to satisfie Gods just Law, was not in the power of any finite creature, Man or Angel: and therefore I despaired, no ran|some could be found in all the world for me a poor sinner. Oh t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e bitterness that my soul felt, in the horrour of my damned estate! No tongue can utter what my soul felt. I had a taste of hell tor|ments in my soul; my meditation of Gods Omniscience, whereby he knew all my sins, not onely open, but secret ones, brought in|numerable sins to my remembrance, one of which was enough to damn me, but I had mountains of guilt heaped upon my distressed soul; the impossibility for me to satisfie divine Justice, and the im|possibility of pardon without satisfaction, because God cannot be unjust, and his Law is unchangeable: Such meditations cast me in|to the horrible pit of darkness and desperation. <HI>The redemption of the soul is precious, it ceaseth for ever,</HI> Psal. 498.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="23">Then God opened the mouth of this dear Servant of his, who told me that the infinite mercy and wisdome of God had found out a ransome, a way to satisfie Justice, and fulfil the Law, and to save poor condemned sinners, and that he himself had found mercy in that way. This bred some hope in my soul, and stayed me from sinking quite down, when I heard of a possibility: but still I was in distressing doubt and fear that it was but some delusion, because I could not see a possibility for Man or Angel, or any Creature, to satisfie and give a ransome to infinite Justice.</P>
<P>Then he declared to me, that it is true that no Creature could give a ransome to satisfie Justice, but God himself was able to sa|tisfie the infinite Justice of God. To that I yielded, that God himself might satisfie his Justice, but still I was in the dark, I could not see this could possibly be. Then he opened me, that adored Doctrine of God his being One and Three; how God was one in Essence, three in Persons, God the Father, God the Son, and God the holy Ghost; how the Father doth by an eternal in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">elle|ctual act conceive the Image of Himself, as being the only adequate Object he understands himself; and this is called the Bege<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ting of the Son, by an intellectual conception of his own Image: and these two Subsistencies, do by an eternal act of Volition love each other; and this Love is the third Person in Trinity, proceeding from both the Father and the Son.</P>
<P>Now the eternal Majesty of God agreed within himself, that God the Son, the second Person in Trinity, should assume humane Nature to himself, and become a man, subject to the Law. This glorious Person is the greatest subject that ever the Law had, and this glorious Person is able perfectly to fulfil the Law, and perfect|ly to pay a ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">some satisfactory to infinite Justice, who hath done it. This depth of divine Wisdome my soul admired, and shall do to eternity.</P>
<P>But still I was at a loss how I should be interested in the ransome that this glorious Person hath paid. Then did this Messenger of God declare unto me, that this glorious Person Jesus Christ had undertaken both parts of this work: First to atone, and reconcile God to man, by paying the ransome required, and by perfect fulfil|ling the Law: Secondly, to subdue the soul and will of man to turn, and submit to be reconciled to God. But this work of converting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> soul to God is such, that as no man can convert him|self, so no other Creature is able to do it, onely God himself can do it; and for that end, both the Father and Son have sent forth the holy Ghost, the eternal Spirit, to work upon the hearts of men, and to create the work of Faith in them by the Word, and then to take possession of, and dwell in believing souls, to mortifie their lusts, to sanctifie their hearts and lives, and to lead them in the way of grace unto glory.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="23">And he further declared to me, that this blessed Spirit of G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, by the Word of God, had already begun this great work in my soul: for a new light is set up in my soul, a work beyond the reach of man; and that light hath convinced me of sin, and of my my damned estate by sin; it had made a separa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion and divorce be|twixt sin and my soul; it had cut me off the old stock, and l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">id my soul down at the foot of Christ, capable with all humble thank|fulness to accept salvation, not by any merit of mine, but by free-grace of Christ unto a vile and unworthy sinner. This I could not deny, but I did finde such conviction, and such a submission to Christ: and this he declared to be the first step and beginning of the work of sound Conversion.</P>
<P>I crave your patience for a few words more. Then he proceed|ed to shew me that the work was finished by the Promise, which also the Spirit of God doth bring home unto the soul, and makes up the match betwixt Christ and the soul. And to that purpose he brought <HI>Mat</HI> 11.28, 29. by which Text he shewed me, as in a glass,

<P>Though I am younger then my Brother with whom I am sent, yet I know my self to be in a clearer capacity to answer to this case, then my Brother is, because <HI>Cutsh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">oquin,</HI> the first great Sachem that prayed to God, and after him <HI>Chikk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k,</HI> and after him <HI>Msqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mmog,</HI> were Sachems in the Town where I live, and they were my Sachems, and I well know how the <HI>praying Indians</HI> did carry the matter towards them.</P>
<P>And first, I say, if any of the <HI>praying Indians</HI> should be disobe|dient (in lawful things) and refuse to pay Tribute unto their Sa|chems, it is not their Religion and praying to God that teache<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> them so to do, but their Corruptions; it is a sickness that need|eth Physick to cure it, and not allowance and countenance to de|fend it: I am sure the Word of God commandeth all to <HI>be sub|ject to the higher powers,</HI> and to pay them Tribute, <HI>Rom.</HI> 13.1, 2, 3, 4, 5 6 7. And Christ Jesus hath commanded to <HI>give unto Cesar the things that belong to Cesar, and to God the things that belong to God.</HI> And thus we have been taught. All the time that <HI>Cutshamoqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> lived, our Town did alwayes honour, obey, and pay Tribute unto him; and so far as I know, so did all the <HI>praying Indians</HI> which belonged to his Jurisdiction After his decease we chose <HI>Iosi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI> or <HI>Chikkatabuk,</HI> but not until he had promised before the Gover|nour and Magistrates of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> at <HI>Boston,</HI> To pray unto God, and to defend and govern us in praying to God all the dayes of his life. And though he fell back from his promise, yet our Town alwayes owned him. And when he began to recover himself a littl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> before his death, the people were ready to adhere unto him, and acknowledge him. In his life time we accepted his Bro|ther, at his request <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and <HI>Msquammog</HI> his leaving us, is his own act and not ours. And therefore, beloved Sachem, let not your heart fear that praying to God will alienate your people from you; nay, be assured it will more firmly oblige their hearts unto you.

<P>All that my Brother hath said I second, and can bear wit|ness unto it; onely I will adde one thing more, of which I know more then he doth, because it was acted in the Town where I live. There was some subtile endeavour to have mingled the <HI>praying</HI> and <HI>non-praying Indians,</HI> and to have reduced the <HI>praying Indians</HI> un|der
<PB N="46" REF="26">
the power of <HI>non praying Indians,</HI> contrary to publick and evident Conditions. Against this, did some of the wiser sort (who saw the Trap) firmly&punc; stand; giving this Reason: The Fox came to the Lambs door, and would fain come in, but the Lambs refused. Then the Fox desired to let him put in but one Claw; the Lambs refused, saying, If he get in but one Claw&punc; he will not rest till he have wrigled in his whole body. Stop waters while they be small and supera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le.

<P>If that be true which you say, all is not true that is talk|ed against the <HI>praying Indians</HI>; and indeed I do see that they are the worser sort of men that do speak so ill of them, the wiser sort are not so minded. I have nothing within the compass of my knowledge, to gainsay that which you have spoken; and I know not but that a course may be taken to oblige both sides, as you took a course to oblige your Sachem.

<SPEAKER>Ant.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess that this is a strong temptation, and requireth much Self-denial and Faith to conflict with it. I pray consider what Counsel Jesus Christ giveth in this case, <HI>Matth.</HI> 16.24. <HI>Let a man deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.</HI> I confess that this is harsh Doctrine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o flesh and blood; but I will tell you a Cordial a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ainst it, <HI>Matth.</HI> 19.29&punc; <HI>Every one that hath forsaken Hou|ses, or Brethren, or Sisters, or Father, or Mother, or Wife, or Chil|dren, or Lands for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y Names sake, shall receive an hundred fold<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and shall inherit everlasting life.</HI> Trust God in this Promise, and see if he do not perform it. And be assured, it is better to trust God in a way of well doing, then to trust to wicked and vile men in a way of sin. If God will punish you, all your men, especially the worst of them, cannot save you; but if all your men should for|sake
<PB N="47" REF="26">
you, and yet you choose Christ, and be true to him, then Christ will certainly take care of you. And further, this is but a fear that humane Reason maketh; try the Lord, it may be he will make all your men to stick the closer to you. You think t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e better sort will stick to you, it is but the loss of the worser sort, at the worst, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d if you trust in the Lord, he can over-rule the hearts of the worst of men, and they shall no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> forsake you. Besides you may put it to the trial, put it to the publick Vote; if you should do so, I do think that they will all promise to stick unto you if you pray to God: and then this Objection is cut off in the beginning of the work. Consider also what Christ ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h said, <HI>Mat.</HI> 11.29, 30. he commands such as come to him, to <HI>take up my yoke, and learn of me, for I am meek, and lowly of heart, and ye shall finde rest to your souls: For my yoke is easie, and my burthen light.</HI> You fear that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">his will be burthensome, heavy, and to your loss; try the Lord if he do not make this Objection easie and light unto you: and see if it do not prove that you are more afraid then hurt. Christ will not suffer any body to lose by him, at last. Nay, you shall be a certain and a great gainer by it, both in this world, and in the world to come.</P>

<P>As my Brother hath said, I acknowledge this to be (in ap|pearance at least) a strong temptation. This was the temptation of <HI>Iosias,</HI> that drew him to his Apostacy, he forsook his praying people, and adhered unto those who did not pray to God: but this was because his own he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rt did not love praying to God, and did better like of the wicked wayes of the <HI>non praying Indians.</HI> But what got he at l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st by adhering to the worst sort of his Sub|jects? When he was in distress they all forsook him, which his praying Subjects would not have done, if he would have adhered unto them. Likewise this very thing which you propose, was a temptation to <HI>Cutshamoquin</HI>; His praying to God did make such of his people as loved not that way, to waver in their sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ection to him, and it did begin to make him waver in the matter of pray|ing to God: but God did mercifully preserve him, and kept him stedfast to his dying day. But this he did, he went sometimes a|mong them, he used them kindly, he treated them with gentle per|swasion, without compulsion; by such wayes he so carried the matter, that they forsook him not. And I do not doubt but that the matter may be so ordered and carried, that you may be secured from that danger, which seemeth to lie in your Objection. But indeed the true Reason why sundry of <HI>Cutshamoquin</HI> his men left him&punc; whereby he fell under poverty, was this, He sold unto the
<HI>English</HI> all our Lands which lay by the Sea-side and Salt water, save onely one Field; and then it was, that they went to such other places as they liked better. And this one Field also, <HI>Iosias</HI> sold away; and the Inland place, where we now live, Mr. <HI>Eliot</HI> pro|cured
<PB N="48" REF="27">
for us, after we prayed to God.</P>
<P>But let the worst of your fears come to pass, suppose all your Subjects that hate praying to God should leave you, what s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ll you lose by it? you are rid of such as by their sins vitiate others, and multiply transgression, and provoke the wrath of God against you and yours. But consider what you shall gain by praying to God: Do not trouble your self by p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ring upon what you shall lose, which at most is but a very small matter. Turn your eye to the other side, and look what you shall gain; you lose a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w wicked men which hate praying to God; but if you pray <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o God, all the <HI>praying Indians</HI> will rejoice at it, and be your friends, and they are no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a few, now, by the grace and blessing of Jesus Christ; all the <HI>Massachusets Indians</HI> will be your friends; all the <HI>praying In|dians</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Nipmuk</HI> Country will be your friends; all the <HI>praying Indians</HI> of <HI>Nop</HI> will be your friends; all the <HI>praying Indians</HI> or <HI>Nan|tuket</HI> will be your friends; all the <HI>praying Indians</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Mahshepog,</HI> and all Eastward from them as far as <HI>Cape Cod</HI>; all the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e will be your friends: and what comparison is betwixt these, and those you lose?</P>
<P>Again, suppose you lose a few Subjects that hate praying to God, but ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> you shall gain a more intim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">te love of the Gover|nour, and Magistrates, and good people of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> who were ever good friends to your Father <HI>Onsamequin,</HI> and to you hitherto; but if you pray to God, you shall finde a difference, they will more honour, respect and love you, then ever they did; they will em|brace you as a Brother in Christ Jesus. Yea further, the Gover|nour and Magistrates of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> will own you, and be fa|therly and friendly to you. The Commissioners of the United Colonies will own you. Yea more, the King of <HI>England,</HI> and the great Peers who are Heads of the Corporation there, who yearly send over Means to encourage and promote our praying to God, they will take notice of you: and what are a few of your Subjects that hate praying to God, in comparison of all these? Yea moreover, and above all these Considerations, that which is said, <HI>Luke</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">5.7. <HI>I tell you, there shall be joy in heaven over one poor sinner that repent|eth</HI>; So that God in heaven, Jesus Christ, the holy Ghost, and the holy Angels in heaven, will joy at your turning to God.

<P>I perceive that in your praying to God, and in your Churches, all are brought to an equality; Sachems and people they are all f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">llow-brethren in your Churches; Poor and Rich are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|qually priviledged; the Vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of the lowes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the people, hath as much weight as the Vote of the Sachem. Now I doubt that this way will lift up the heart of the poor to too much boldness, and debase the Rulers too low: this bringing all to an equality, will bring all to a confusion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ant.</SPEAKER>
<P>This also I confess is a great and weighty Point, and must be looked upon with much prudence and caution. The weight of a Vote lieth not so much in the man, as in the matter wherein he Vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eth. A poor wise man may give a better Reason then a rich man, or a Ruler, and then it is the Reason that prevaileth, not the man. We must all be ruled by the Word of God, both Sachem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and people. The Word of God in the mouth of a poor man, must be regarded for the Words sake, and not for the mans sake, be he rich or poor. The management of Church Liberties is a narrow edge, and may easily be miscarried, and prove hurtful; which difficulty must be helped by good conduct: the well-ordering of a Church is a point of great wisdome and care; but we must not therefore fly off from a Rule, because it is difficult, but it must be acted with the more fear, care and prayer.</P>
<P>There is such a Rule in the Gospel-way of the Churches, as E|quality of Vote among Believers in the matters of Jesus Christ: And herein is a great point of Self denial in Sachems and chief men, to be equal to his Brethren in the things that appertain to Christ, who is no respecter of persons: So it is said, <HI>Col.</HI> 3.11. <HI>Where there i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> neither Greek nor Iew, Circumcision nor Vncircum|cision, Barbarian, Scyth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ond nor free, but Christ is all, and in all.</HI> And as Faith <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es all Believers equal in Christ, so doth the Order of the Gospel: all that are in Gospel-order, are equally concerned in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ffairs of Jesus Christ. And this should not be a trouble, but a comfort and joy to every one; and therefore it is said, <HI>Iam.</HI> 1.9, 10. <HI>Let the brother of low degree rejoyce, in that he is exalted; but the ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h in that he is made low:</HI> for by both these Christ is exal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, and in that we must rejoice.</P>

<P>All that my Brother hath said is weighty: I will adde <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> word further to the edge of your Objection.

<P>I am willing to adde a word or two by way of lenitive. Though the matter be harsh and bitter, yet the manner of applying must be with all reverence, gentleness, meekness, tenderness, and love, so as to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">void all exasperation or provocation. So the Lord hath commanded, <HI>Galat.</HI> 6.1. <HI>If a man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, con|sidering thy self&punc; lest thou also be tempted.</HI></P>
<P>And for your fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ther encouragement, we finde in the Scripture that great Kings and rulers have meekly submitted to this soul|physick. <HI>David</HI> was sharply reproved by the Prophet, and he meek|ly submitted to it, 2 <HI>Sam</HI> 12. and so it was with <HI>Eli,</HI> 1 <HI>Sam</HI> 2.27. Let it not therefore be unacceptable unto you, to imitate so great, so good Examples. If Sachems might sin, and no body might ad|monish them, because they be rulers, and the Ministers and people are the subjects, it were the most miserable condition in the world to be a Sachem or a ruler, they run to hell without controll, and no body may say unto him, Why do you so? It is said, <HI>Isa.</HI> 30.33. <HI>Tophet is ordained of old, yea for the King i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is prepared.</HI> If God have ordained hell for Sachems, then sure he hath ordained means to keep them out of it, as well as for other men; for <HI>God desireth not the death of a sinner, but rather that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e should repent and live.</HI> If therefore you desire to escape hell, and to go to heaven, submit your soul to such means as God hath appointed to bring you to repentance and salvation. When you put the Objection, you s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">id you are a sinful man as well as others: therefore your own heart will tell you that you have need of such helps as God hath ap|pointed to bring you to repentance, else you cannot be saved.</P>

<P>I Have so ordered my occasions, that they will give way to my attendance to the matter you come about, therefore this Afternoon I have set apart, that we may have further Confe|rence about them.</P>
<P>The former points we discoursed, I am willing they should still lie soaking in my heart and minde. I am not ready to make Re|plies, or to draw forth any further speech about them. I choose rather to draw forth some of my other Doubts and Objections; unto which, if your Answers be as considerable and weighty, as they were to my former doubts, I shall then s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e cause to lay them up also a soaking, and pondering in my heart. Know this, that in the rowlings of my thoughts, the disquiet turnings and tum|blings of my minde, do oft-times molest me with variety of pas|sions. I am sometimes in grief and anguish of minde, especially when I over look my life past, and remember the many sins and follies that I have stained my life and honour withall, I think with my self, What a fool have I been, that for the love of a lust, which Dogs and brute Creatures delight in, that I, a Man, a Sachem, should be so besotted, as to stain my honour, wound my Soul, of|fend God, and expose my self to eternal damnation, and all this for a short delight that is gone with a blast, and leaves nothing be|hinde but shame and sorrow; and these are durable and indelible, a sad effect of sensual pleasures. Ah what a fool have I been? when I should have imployed my self in higher and greater mat|ters for the honour of God, and the good of my people&punc; I have wasted my precious time and strength to satiate my pleasures, which have left such a sting and torment in my soul, which all my Estate and Honour cannot ease me of, but they are like to torment me for ever. I am never without wicked company to draw me out unto such iniquities, but none of them can ease the torment of my minde and conscience, though some apply themselves so to do, I do finde their remedies are false and uneffectual.</P>

<P>I thank you for these comfortable words, I feel them in my heart, and I desire to lay them up among other things which I ponder in my heart.</P>
<P>And now I will proceed to open such other doubts which lie in my minde, as impediments which hinder me, and delay me from ac|cepting of this way of praying to God. I perceive in all your dis|courses, that you have a Book which you call <HI>The Word of God,</HI> and you reade it to me. I perceive also that in your worshipping of God morning and night, you reade in that Book: I pray tell me what Book that is&punc; what is written in it? and how do you know that it is the Word of God? Many say that some wise English-men have d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vised and framed it, and tell us that it is Gods Word, when as it is no other then the words of wise men.</P>
<P>Hoh! we shall be interrupted in our discourse, for here cometh in S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">chem that hateth praying to God, and hath been a means of delaying my entrance into this way: but if he come up unto us, we will go on and let him be partaker of our discourse, if he like of it, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d be willing so to do.</P>

<P>I am willing to be present and hear your discourse, but as for this new way of praying to God, I like it not. We and our Forefathers have through all generations lived in our Religion, which I desire not to change; Are we wiser then our Forefathers? And I like not to suffer our people to reade that Book which they call the Word of God. If it be Gods Word, it is too deep for ignorant people to meddle withall; and it will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ill them with new light and notions, which withdraws them from our obedience, and leadeth them to make trouble and disturbance unto us, in those old wayes in which we and our Forefathers have walked: and my Counsel is to suppress the reading of that Book.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ant.</SPEAKER>
<P>With due respect unto you, Sachem, I shall thus answer unto what you s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y. If a great Sachem in a far Country should send unto you a writing, wherein he giveth you wise Counsel, would you not reade it? would you not hear what he saith? and would you not suffer your people to learn wisdome, but continue in their ignorance and blindness? Sure you would shew so much respect to a man, a Sachem, that should do so kindly to you. Now so it is, that the great God who made these high heavens, and the great Lights that be therein; who made this Earth, and all this great World, and all things in it; who is King of kings, and Lord of lords: I say this Great God, pittying to see the ignorance that all men are darkned withall, he hath sent us his VVord, which will make wise the ignorant, and will you not suffer your people to learn that wisdome? do you love darkness better then light?</P>
<P>Besides, all Mankinde live in the wayes of sin, which lead them to hell torments, where they shall be punished with eternal fire: but God pittying this miserable condition of man, hath sent us this VVord of his, which sheweth us the way to escape hell tor|ments, and leadeth us into the way that leadeth us to eternal life, happiness and glory. And will not you suffer your people to learn this good way, when God offereth it unto us? Consider how your people will curse you, when they feel these torments, because you would not suffer them to learn the true way to heaven and happi|ness. And what though we are not wiser then our Forefathers, yet God can teach us such wisdome as our Forefathers did not know. I think, that we are bound to think that our fathers were so wise, that if Gods VVord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad been brought and offered to them, they would have received it, and would have learned by it to be wiser then they were, and why therefore should not we be so wise, as to do that which our wise fathers would have done, if this light had shined unto them, as it now doth unto us. Let not the deepness of that wisdome in Gods VVord, hinder us that are ignorant from searching into it, for by reading of Gods word the ignorant may be made wise, <HI>Psal.</HI> 197. <HI>it maketh wise the simple</HI>: and <HI>Prov.</HI> 1.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>The Word gives wisdome to the simple, and to the young man know|ledge
<PB N="56" REF="31">
and discretion. David</HI> learned to be wise by reading the word of God, <HI>Wiser then his Enemies, wiser then his Teachers, wiser then the Ancients,</HI> Psal. 119.98, 99, 100. and so may we. It is a vain word to say, They are ignorant, and therefore they may not reade the Word; the contrary to this is true, Because they are ignorant, therefore let them search and reade the word of God, be|cause that will make them wise. But you give the reason that lieth in the bottom of your heart, when you say, By reading of the word they will learn new light, which will molest and trouble them that love and walk in their old lusts, and deeds of darkness, and therefore you will keep them from the light. But I pray con|sider at what a dear rate you purchase your quiet in your old ways of sin and darkness, which lead you to hell, when you will compel all your people to live in sin and darkness, for fear lest when they finde the light of Gods Word, they should molest and trouble you in your lusts and sins.</P>

<P>I will adde a few words to what my Brother hath spoken. I have heard that in the other part of the World there be a certain people who are called <HI>Papists,</HI> whose Ministers and Teachers live in all manner of wickedness and lewdness, and permit and teach the people so to do: and these wicked Ministers will not suffer the people to reade the Word of God, and pretend the same reason as you do, Because they be ignorant. But the true reason is the same which you plainly speak out, lest by the knowledge of the VVord, they should have light to see into their vileness, and mo|lest them in their lusts and sins. And they are so cruel, that if they finde any one that readeth the word of God, they will kill him. They choose rather to lead all their people with them to hell, then to suffer them to see the light whereby they may be saved, lest when they see the light, they should discover their filthiness, and trouble them in their way to hell. But God doth account these men Murtherers, and hath threatned to bring upon them fearful destruction, to revenge the blood of Gods people whom they have murthered. Therefore I pray you to consider, that the like ven|geance from God will fall upon you, if you will not suffer your people to search into, and learn the word of God.</P>

<P>What you have said hath fully setled and satisfied my heart in this point. I will never hinder my people from the know|ledge of the word of God, and I wonder at those vile Ministers that do so wickedly abuse the people; and I wonder at the Sa|chems, that they will suffer such vile Ministers to abuse their peo|ple in that manner, why do they not suppress them? and why do they not Command their people to Print the Bible, and let it be free for any man that will buy them, and reade them? I wonder at these things; Can you satisfie me in the reason hereof?</P>

Some Sachems are as bad as the Ministers, and of the same minde with their Ministers, they are li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e minded as this Sachem is; o|ther Sachems that are wiser and better minded, yet they cannot help it, because their Ministers are so rich, and by that means have so many people depending on them, that their Sachems dare not meddle with them; and their Ministers take a cunning course to keep themselves and successors rich, for they will not suffer one an|other to marry, whereby they should have lawful Children to inhe|rit their riches, but when they die the next Minister hath all, or most of the riches that he had. And to the end they may keep one anothe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from marrying, they suffer one another to keep VVhores, so that they have Bastards good store, but no lawful Children.

<SPEAKER>Keit.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh strange! how many of these wicked Ministers be there, that they are so potent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, a great many. The Ministers of I know not how ma|ny Countries combine together, and be of one minde to uphold one another; and they choose one Chief, and call him a <HI>Pope,</HI> and say that he has power to pardon mens sins, and will sel Pardons for Money, and by that means they get a great deal of wealth, for people are such fools as to think that he can pardon them, when as the Popes be as vile sinners as any body, and keep VV<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ores, and get Bastards. Other of these Ministers they call <HI>Cardinals</HI>; others <HI>Lord Archbishop</HI>; others, <HI>Lord Bishop</HI>; other, <HI>Lord Abbot</HI>; o|ther, <HI>Lord Prior,</HI> and I cannot tell how many more: and many of these as rich as Sachems, and leave their wealth to their succes|sors, because they have no lawful Children, onely keep VVhores, and get Bastards. And they will allow their Sachems, or any body else, to keep VVhores, and get Bastards, and the Pope will par|don them for money. And this that I tell you, is but a little of the filthiness that is among these wicked Ministers. Now if peo|ple should but look into the word of God, they would presently finde that no body can pardon sins but God; and they would pre|sently finde, that God has appointed no such Ministers as these, they are all of them the Devils Ministers, and not God's: and if Sachems and people knew this, they would buy no more Pardons of them, and the Sachems would suppress them, and take away their great riches, or imploy them to better uses. And for this reason they will not suffer any but themselves to reade the Scri|pture, they will kill them if they do; and they have <HI>Lords Inqui|sitors,</HI> as they call them, to watch and search if any body have a
<PB N="58" REF="32">
Bible, or any other good Book, that opens and discovers their Villany, he shall be killed: And these Lords Inquisitors are as rich as Sachems. And thus they keep all men in subjection to them, and in fear of them, and Sachems are afraid of them, and they do what they list.</P>

And if all this vileness be maintained by ignorance of the word of God, it seemeth to me, that it is a principal thing in Religion to know and be acquainted with the word of God; and therefore I desire that now we may go on with our intended discourse. And whereas I proposed two questions, me thinks that much may be gathered out of this discourse we have had, tending to shew what matter is contained in the word of God.

<P>This Question is one great Principle in Religion; and I cannot take a surer and better course to answer it, then by decla|ring the Answer that is given in our Catechism unto the Question, and by opening some of the Texts of Scripture, which are there brought for the proof and manifestation thereof.</P>
<P>The Question is, <HI>What is the Word of God</HI>? The Answer is, It is the Will of God written in the Bible, whereby he rightly guideth man, in every thing in this world, and whereby he bringeth us to eternal salvation.

<P>The word and will of God written in a Book, whereby we may not onely hear it with our ears, when it is spoken by others, but we may see it with our eyes, and reade the writing our selves. And this is a great benefit to us, to have Gods word and will writ|ten; for a word spoken is soon gone, and nothing retaineth it but our Memory, and that impression which it made upon our minde and heart; but when this word is written in a Book, there it will abide, though we have forgotten it, and we may reade it over a thousand times, and help our weak memories, so that it shall ne|ver be forgotten; yea, and such as cannot have an opportunity of hearing the word, yet they may alwayes have an opportunity of reading the word, because it is written in the Bible, which they have by them in their houses, and may reade in it night and day. We do therefore call the word of God <HI>Scripture,</HI> because it is written in a book.</P>

<P>The first Text I mention is <HI>Hos.</HI> 8.12. <HI>I have written to him the great things of my Law, but they were counted as a strange thing.</HI> Here God gives to man a Law, and he writeth this Law; and eve|ry thing in this Law is <HI>a great matter</HI>: though some things are grea|ter then other, yet every thing that God hath written is a great matter. But God doth blame men for counting them as <HI>strange things</HI>; we should be well acquainted with them.</P>
<P><HI>Dan.</HI> 10.21. when an Angel spake to <HI>Daniel,</HI> he told him, that <HI>he would declare to him that which is noted in the Scriptures of truth.</HI> And we that teach others must carefully so do, we must teach no|thing but that which is noted in, and grounded upon the Scri|ptures of truth. And we need to teach nothing else, for all things needful for salvation are contained in the Scriptures, as appears 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.16, 17. <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Scripture is given by interpretation from God, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness; That the man of God may be perfect, throughly fur|nished to all good works.</HI> The man of God here, meaneth, or may be applied to any honest man that is willing to walk by the Rule of the word, be he a Sachem, or a Teacher, or a Father, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Every man may finde in the Scriptures a perfect rule to guide him in eve|ry thought, word or deed. So that the word of God is a perfect Law to guide every man, in every thing, all the dayes of his life. And the word of God is not onely a rule to guide us in this life, but it also brings us to heaven; <HI>Acts</HI> 20.32. <HI>I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and give you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n inheritance among them that are sanctified:</HI> and <HI>Iames</HI> 1.21. <HI>Re|ceive with meekness the ingrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</HI> Many such testimonies I might adde, to shew the fulness of perfection of the word of God: but I forbear at present.</P>

<P>I will adde a few words touching the perfection of the Scriptures. <HI>Deut.</HI> 12.32. <HI>Whatsoever I command you, observe to do it; thou shalt not adde thereto, nor diminish from it.</HI> Here be two wayes of wronging the Scriptures; 1. By adding to it; 2. By taking from it. Now these Popish Teachers and Ministers of whom I did discourse before, they do most wickedly wrong the Scri|ptures, especially by adding to them. They say that their Offices are commanded in the Scripture, and that the Pope is Christ his Vicar, and that he hath power to pardon sin, and abundance more such rotten stuff they adde unto the Scripture.</P>
<P>Now this is another reason why they will not suffer people to reade the Scriptures, because then every body would finde out their false dealing; and therefore if any body finde them out, they will presently kill them. The great wrong they do unto the Scri|ptures of truth, is one of their great sins; they adde their own

</SP>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The first Reason to prove the Scriptures to be the Word o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> God, is, Because they teach us the first Creation of the World, and all things in it, which no man nor Angel doth know or ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> teach, onely God; and this is proved in the first Chapter of <HI>Gene|sis,</HI> w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ere we reade the wonderful work of God in the Creation of the World, where man was last made.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The second Reason is fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the holiness and perfection of the word of God. No man or A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gel could give so holy, pure and per|fect a Law, as G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ds Law is, <HI>Psal.</HI> 19.8, 9, 10, 11. also <HI>Psal.</HI> 12.6. <HI>The words of the Lord are pure words; as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The third Reason is, Because the word of the Lord is con|firmed by such Miracles, as onely God himself is able to perform. <HI>Moses</HI> the first writer of Scripture, did many great Miracles, in <HI>Egypt,</HI> in the Red Sea, and in the VVilderness; so did many other Prophets: but especially Jesus Christ did many wonderful Mira|cles, and so did the Apostles, by which our Faith is confirmed, that their writings are the word of God.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Because the Scriptures doth reveal unto us Jesus Christ, and salvation by Christ, according to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. This no man or Angel could ever have found out, onely God, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.19. <HI>God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, and hath committed to us the word of Reconciliation</HI> John 5.39. <HI>Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think to finde eternal life: and they ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they that testifie of me.</HI> Therefore they are the word of God.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Because the word of God doth convert the soul from sin and Satan, unto God. It sanctifieth the soul, and doth lead me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> souls in the wayes of life, unto salvation; it is the sword of the Spirit to conquer the Devil&punc; <HI>Iam.</HI> 1.18. <HI>Of his own will begat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e us with the word of truth.</HI> Joh. 17.17. <HI>Sanctifie them through the

<P>Who can oppose or gainsay the mountainous weight of these Arguments? I am more then satisfied, I am ashamed of my ignorance, and I abhor my self that ever I doubted of this point; and I desire wholly to give up my self to the knowledge of, and obedience to the word of God, and to abandon and forsake these sins which the word of God reproveth and condemneth.</P>

<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will adde one Consideration further, to manifest that the Scriptures are the word of God; and that is, By the great Anti|quity of these writings, which have been extant so many thousand years, and have passed through so many enemies hands, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ave used all art and force to abolish them, or corrupt them, and yet they could never d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it. <HI>Moses</HI> wrote the first Five Books of Scri|pture above a thousand and four hundred years before Christ came, and it is above a thousand and six hundred years since Christ came, and since the G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l, the last part of the Scripture, was written. Put these two Numbers together, and they make three thousand years. So long the Church have had the Scriptures: and all this while the Devil and wicked men have endeavoured either to abo|lish them, or corrupt them, but they could never do it; we have every word of God perfect and pure unto this day, which cannot be said of any other writing in all the world. And this wonderful divine protection of this Book, doth greatly manifest, that doubt|less it is Gods own word, over which he hath bestowed such emi|nent care.</P>

<P>The Scriptures themselves have kept a perfect Record of Times from the beginning of the World unto the coming of Christ, and out of that Chronologie we may perfectly know how long <HI>Mo|ses</HI> was before Christ; and there be other sure wayes to know how many years it is since Christ came. And thus may we know certain|ly how long the Scriptures have been written.</P>

Before we part, I have one motion and request to propose unto you; To morrow is your Sabbath, and I have a desire that you two would teach us that day, and let us see the manner how you worship God; it may please God to make more of his light to shine among us.

I now sit upon the Bench to judge others, then I must stand at the Barre to be judged my self. Oh what mountains of sin have I heaped up in my wicked life! I had forgot my sins, and I thought God had forgot them too; and I had thought my Conscience had forgot them also, but now I see it is not so. God hath numbred all my wayes, my thoughts, my words and works, and I feel now that my Conscience remem|breth them also, though it hath been asleep in the times of my ig|norance and profaneness. Oh I am a wretch: I should have been an example to my people, an example of virtue, of wisdome and of praying to God, but I have done quite contrary to my duty: I have been an example of lust, of profaneness, yea of all sin; and in particular of this great sin of profaning the Sabbath: my heart is wounded with the sense of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in especially, and that forceth my troubled Conscience to gall and afflict my soul with the remembrance of all my sins. But why say I all? I now finde my sins are numberless: my own personal sins are many, great and vile, my heart doth loath my self to remember them, they make me an abhorring to God. But moreover and besides my own personal sins, other mens sins I am guilty of; Oh how many have sinned upon my account, many wayes?

<P>The doctrine of the Sabbath is a great Point in Religion. It is one of the Ten Moral, Univers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l Commandments of God, which are required of all Mankinde; and the fourth Command, a chief Hinge of all the rest. By a religious keeping of the Sab|bath, we act our obedience to all the Commands. By profaning the Sabbath, we turn all Religion and good Order out of doors, and set open a door unto all sin and wickedness, so weighty a matter is the good keeping of the Sabbath-day. For the opening of the Sabbath, I know not a better way, then to open (briefly) the fourth Command; w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ich I shall do, by laying it out into six parts.</P>

<ITEM>1. Here is the Preface, in this word, <HI>Remember the Sabbath-day,</HI> to shew the great weight and worth of the Sabbath, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> our prone|ness to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">light it; and to stablish a perpetual and careful prepara|tion to the Sabbath, <HI>Neh.</HI> 13.19. <HI>And it came to pass, that when the gates of Ierusalem began to be dark before the Sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the Sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the Sabbath day.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Here is the Affirmative part of the Command, wherein we are commanded to keep the whole Sabbath holy, both in thought, word and deed, <HI>Isa.</HI> 58.13. <HI>If thou turn away thy foot from the Sab|bath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day, and call the Sabbath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable, and shalt honour him, not doing thine own wayes, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Here is an exact distribution of all time betwixt God and man, wherein God hath appointed six parts or dayes to man, and the seventh part is dedicated to God: and hence it followeth that the Sabbath was capable of being changed, from the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st of seven, to the first of seven; and so the Lord hath changed it, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 16.2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">

<HI>Acts</HI> 20.7. <HI>Rev.</HI> 1.10. And when this Change was first made, the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urch kept two Sabbaths together, as the Passover and the Lords Supper were together.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Here is the Negative part of this Command, wherein we are forbidden all our own works, in that word or deed, <HI>Thou shalt do no manner o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> work.</HI></ITEM>

<ITEM>2. The second Reason is, Because God hath put a blessing on the head of the Sabbath, and on all that keep it holy: <HI>He blessed the seventh day.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The third Reason is, Because the Lord made it holy, he de|dicated it to holy use, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erefore may not be violated without sacriledge. <HI>Mal.</HI> 3.8. <HI>Will ye rob God</HI>?

<P>Alas, your sorrowful countenance doth indeed discover, that your minde is oppressed with grief, and in such cases men are miserable comforters; God onely knoweth how to speak a word of Comfort to the heart, he made the heart of man, he knoweth all the sorrows and griefs thereof; and usually God doth afflict the heart with grief, out of great love, that he might call the distressed soul to come to him, and to make its griefs known to him, and he is very gracious and pitiful to such afflicted souls: for Christ hath said, <HI>Mat.</HI> 11.28. <HI>Come unto me ye that labour and are heavy laden&punc; and I will give you rest.</HI> My first Counsel therefore is, that you would pray unto God, and believe in Jesus Christ, and he will surely give you rest.

<P>You have prevented me, or rather the Spirit of God hath put into your heart by power and grace, that which I intended to have presented to you by way of Advice and Counsel, namely, To be frequent and abundant in reading the Scriptures, for you see that all Soul-cordials are laid up there, fetch them out therefore from that divine <HI>Treasury,</HI> and make use of them for your com|fort. I know the Devil will oppose you in this matter, and keep you from conversing in the Scriptures, because they are <HI>the sword of the Spirit,</HI> Eph. 6.17. whereby we resist his temptations, as Christ himself hath set us an example, <HI>Mat.</HI> 4.4, 7, 10. when the Devil as|saulted him with a temptation, he drew forth the sword of the Spi|rit, a Text of Scripture, and opposed the temptation thereby, and that presently conquered the Tempter.

<P>All Mankinde are once born, by natural birth they come into this world; but all Gods children are born again, <HI>Iohn</HI> 3.3. <HI>Except a man be born again, he cannot enter into the kingdome of hea|ven</HI>: and this is a spiritual birth, <HI>ver</HI> 5. <HI>Except a man be born of water, and of the Spirit,</HI> &amp;c. Baptism is an outward sign of it, but the inward grace is a work of the Spirit, and the Spirit worketh by the Word of God, <HI>Iames</HI> 1.18, 21. <HI>Of his own will begat he us by the word of truth</HI>; and <HI>ver.</HI> 21. <HI>Wherefore lay apart all fil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the ingrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</HI> By faith in the Promise the soul is united to Christ, and <HI>he that is joyned to the Lord is one Spi|rit,</HI> 1 Cor. 6.17. When an afflicted soul doth venture it self and its All, upon the faithful word of Promise, and sayes to God, as <HI>Iob</HI> said, <HI>Iob</HI> 13.15. <HI>Though he kill me, yet I will trust in him</HI>; this is the new-born soul, and this believing soul shall be surely saved at last, whatever sorrows and afflictions it goes through in this life.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="38">And wh ereas you say that your sorrows and griefs are but world|ly sorrow: I answer, That the question is not what kinde of sor|row it is, so much, as what the effects of it is; for no matter what the sorrow is, if it drive the soul to Christ; our salvation is by Christ, and not by sorrow: the use of sorrow is to imbitter sin, and the world, and to drive the soul to Christ for relief and rest; if worldly sorrow, or rather sorrow about worldly things do this, it hath its end, and proves to be a godly sorrow. Sorrows are not to merit any thing from God, but to force the afflicted soul to fly to him for refuge. We shall finde examples in Scripture, where sorrows about worldly things have effectually driven the soul to fly to God for refuge. <HI>Psal.</HI> 88.18. <HI>Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance into darkness.</HI> This was an out|ward affliction, and yet in the first verse of that Psalm, it drives him to fly and cry to the <HI>God of his salvation</HI>; and this is an act of faith. So <HI>Psal.</HI> 35.15. <HI>But mine adversaries they rejoyced, they g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|thered themselves together, yea the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased not. With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their eeeth</HI>; that is, some broke jests upon him at their Taverns and Tiplings, and others scorned him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all these were outward afflictions, but they drove <HI>David</HI> to fly and cry to God, <HI>ver.</HI> 17. <HI>Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul,</HI> &amp;c. and this is an act of faith. So it was with <HI>Iob</HI> in his affliction, <HI>Iob</HI> 30.8, 9, 10. the basest of the people made songs and jests upon him; but mark what end God made with <HI>Iob.</HI> So <HI>Iames</HI> speaks, <HI>Iam.</HI> 5.12. Therefore whatever your griefs be, turn them into prayers, and cry to God for relief, and then your grief hath a sanctified end, and you will at last learn to say after <HI>David,</HI> in that high strained string of Faith and Expe|rience, <HI>It is good for me that I was afflicted, that I might learn thy statutes,</HI> Psal. 119.71. And <HI>ver.</HI> 67, of that Psalm, <HI>Before I was af|flicted I we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t astray, but now I have kept thy word.</HI> And therefore what though your afflictions be outward afflictions, seeing God is pleased mercifully to bless them unto your spiritual and eternal good.</P>
<P>But I further observe, that sundry of your expressions do hold forth a spiritual sorrow for your sin, and a fear of Gods wrath, and an earnest desire to flee from, and escape wrath to come. I pray therefore express your self what sorrows and griefs you have of that kinde; for although such sorrows do not deserve any thing at Gods hand, yet they are of a more spiritual nature, and spring from a deep reverence and fear of God, and do more immediately and effectually drive the soul for refuge to Jesus Christ, who onely delivereth the soul from the guilt and condemnation of sin.

<P>Still my soul admireth to see the great use is to be made of the word of God, which doth engage my soul more and more, to a more frequent use of the Scriptures. Lord Jesus help me to perform it.</P>
<P>My fore-mentioned griefs about my outward condition, are but the Porch of those troubles that Iodge in my distressed soul. When I look down into the dungeon of my heart, and the dunghill of my life, I am filled with an abhorrence of my self, and wonderment at Gods patience, to suffer such a wretch as I am to live. I know much of the sins of others, but I know more by my self, then I know by any body else, considering circumstantial aggravations. I can truly say with <HI>Paul,</HI> 1 Tim. 1.15. <HI>sinners, of whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> am chief.</HI> If my Companions have mis-led me, or my leaders have ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sed me to erre, it may aggravate their sin, but be no excuse or apo|logie for mine; I have done as evil as I could, and had not God hampered me with outward affliction and trouble, it is not to be said by man how vile I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hould have been. It is sometimes a quiet|ing argument to my heart, to be patient under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y outward crosses, because they be Mustard on the Worlds Nipples, to keep me from surfetting upon the Creature. If I look into the glass of Gods Law, and behold the face of my life, and of my soul, as they are there represented, I am afraid of my self, I abhorre my self, I am confounded. Gods Sabbaths I have profaned; Gods Word I have neglected; Gods Grace I have despised and resisted; I have bro|ken the whole Law of God, every Command have I violated: for there be some acts of sin that I never did actually commit, yet the habit of sin is in me, and in inclination and desire I am guilty of it: and for a foundation of this mountainous heap of guilt, I am guilty of <HI>Adams</HI> fall, the first, the worst, the root of all the sins of the sons of men. My sinful habit and disposition by nature, doth viciously incline me to sin, against my desires, purposes, promises, and resolutions. When I strive and labour, and cry and pray a|gainst my sins, yet upon the opportunity and occasion offered, my sin will return; I am weak, that is strong; I am subdued, and that prevaileth. <HI>Oh wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me?</HI></P>
<P>When I consider the infinite Justice of God offended, the infinite Wrath of God provoked, the eternal Law of God violated, and the eternal torments provided and prepared in hell for sinners, and the insuperableness of my sin, by any means I can use, it will pre|vail over me, it will keep me in bondage, it will inslave me, and I fear it finally will damn me. In these considerations my soul is sunk and drowned. If therefore there be any Balm for my sore, any succour for my distressed soul, shew me the way how I shall escape these everlasting burnings, that are the just recompence of my transgressions.</P>

<P>It joyes my heart to hear these gracious breathings of Gods Spirit in you. I taste in your discourse evident tokens of a living childe of God. I see that my judgement about the spiri|tual state of your soul, was not a product of precipitate charity, but an effect of the spirit of right discerning. I will encourage you in your godly purposes, with a modest application of some of the Angels words to <HI>Gideon,</HI> Judg. 6.12, 14. <HI>Go on, thou mighty man of valour, and go in this thy strength, and thou shalt save thy people. The Lord will be with thee.</HI> But for the manner of your proceed|ing in this matter, my thoughts incline me to propose this way: Be open to own the grace of God bestowed on you, to confess your former known crooked and dark wayes, and the change which God by his grace hath wrought in you. At present, let your first mo|tion be to stay a while at <HI>Natik,</HI> adjoyn your self to the Church, who when they hear your Confession, will joyfully receive you. In due season, request of the Church to send some able, pious, and fitting Teachers with you, among your people. Prudent Counsel may be taken how to prepare and predispose your people for such a motion. I do not doubt but the Governour and Magistrates of the <HI>Massachusets,</HI> will be easily intreated to interpose in so good a work, which may tend to the bringing in so many people to the service of Jesus Christ.</P>

<P>I do well approve and accept of your Counsel, it sa|voureth of discretion and wisdome, in all things God hath guided your lips to drop like the honey-comb into my heart. And now I have one request further unto you, That while we are together in this solitary opportunity, we may spend some time in conversing with God in Prayer, turn all those things that have passed into Prayers, and the future matters also; let us spread them before the Lord, and beg his guidance and blessing.</P>

<SPEAKER>Iohn.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do greatly accept this motion; and it is another sign of the truth of the work of Gods grace in your heart, because this is the property of the new creature, a new-born babe, that he will cry <HI>Abba Father.</HI> Here we leave them at Prayer.</P>
