<P>_I Come now to the Ar|guments, for the clea|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> convincing of our judgements, in the truth of this point. The first is drawne from the necessity of humane Learning: Thus,</P>
<P>That which is necessary for a Di|vine, may not be contemned, [whe|ther the necessity be absolute, or onely of expediency.]</P>
<P>But humane Learning is necessary for a Divine, <HI>Ergo,</HI> It may not be con|temned.</P>
<P>The Major no sober man will deny: The Minor I will prove by its parts. 1. The Languages, Latine, Greek and Hebrew, are some part of hu|mane
<PB N="2" REF="11">
learning,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Et si sine ill&acirc; quidam non in|utiles Ecclesiis fuerunt, cum tamen lingua illa totius Chri|stianismi quasi quoddam com|mune sit vincu|lum, &amp; omnes pen&egrave; ingenio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">um faetus in hac lingua sint edi|ti, mutilam oportet esse cog|nitionen quae si|ne hujus linguae notiti&acirc; habetur.</HI> Walaeus</NOTE> and these are necessa|rie for a Divine 1. For Latine, many learned Commentaries are written in that language, which a man cannot en|joy without some knowledge of this Tongue; besides, many English words of much use in Divinity, are borrowed of the Latine, which no man can well understand without some insight in this Language.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Greek tongue is necessary, because the New Testament was writ|ten in it; besides, many Latine words are derived from it, which we cannot fully understand without some know|ledge here: also many termes of Art (in Grammer, Rhetorick, Logick, Phy|sicks, Metaphysicks, &amp;c.) are borrow|ed from hence. What grosse errors did many of the Antients run into, and what lame interpretations, doe they oft make, for want of insight in the Originall Languages; yea we had ne|ver enjoyed the translation of the Bi|ble, if some men had not attained this part of humane Learning, the Bible would have been as a sealed book; for how could men, women, and children be able to read the Scripture, had there
<PB N="3" REF="11">
not been learned men, who by great paines and study obtained the know|ledge of the Originals?</P>
<P N="3">3.

<P>Humane learning is necessary for the convincing and confuting of a learned adversary, how shall we be able to preserve the truth in its purity, to stop the mouth of a subtle Jesuite, or learned Heretick, without learning? This san|ctified and rightly improved, is an ex|cellent meanes to bring downe Anti|christs Kingdome; and therefore 'tis well observed, that errors were never higher, and truth lower, then when ig|norance prevailed, and learning was suppressed and contemned, when 'twas suspitious for a man to have Greek, and heresie it selfe to have Hebrew.

<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1. 'Tis false, the Title is not
<PB N="211" REF="119" MS="y">
blasphemous, for 'tis given to S. <HI>Iohn,</HI> who is called by way of eminency, and distinction, <GAP DESC="foreign">, The Divine. As Theology and Divinity are termes con|vertible in our language, so is a Theo|logue and a Divine, the same in sense, though it differ in sound: and therefore if the Scots do well (as you say they do) in calling their Ministers Theologues; then ours do not ill, in speaking plaine English, and calling them onely for di|stinction sake, Divines (i) men set a|part for the study of Theology or Divi|nity. Now see the wit, or if you will the malice of this Magus, this Magitian (for hee pleads for the lawfulnesse of such Titles.)

<PB N="212" REF="120">
proper to God. 2. Be cause wee are Holy and Divine by participation onely, therefore wee may not be called Holy and Divine.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> The answer is easie. Though to be holy and Divine, be essentially proper unto God, yet by way of Ana|logie and resemblance, it is also given to Angels and men. Hence the godly in this life, are called Saints, holy, and in the very letter, partakers of the <HI>Divine Nature,</HI> [2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.4.] not essentiallie, but Analogicallie, partaking of those graces whereby we resemble God.</P>

<P><HI>Ans.</HI> What is this but to destroy the Magistracie? to rob them of their coer|cive power, and make them like Saint <HI>George,</HI> that sits with a drawn sword, but never strikes (a sit emblem of Mr <HI>Websters</HI> Magistrates.)</P>
<P><HI>Ob.</HI> But Mr <HI>Webster</HI> would have them punish Theeves, Murtherers, A|dulterers and Drunkards, onely they must not punish the Saints, lest God re|quire
<PB N="213" REF="120">
the blood of his Saints at their hands. [<HI>page</HI> 98.]</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1. If the Magistrate must punish Theeves, Murtherers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> then <HI>&agrave; forti|ori</HI> he must much more punish spirituall Murtherers, Theeves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for as 'tis a greater sinne to kill the soule, then to kil the body, so they deserve severer punish|ment. 'Tis no Policy, but cruelty, to suf|fer Woolves and Foxes to destroy the flock: neither is the coercive power of the Magistracy, under the Law, aboli|shed by the Gospell, as is excellently cleared by Mr <HI>Prin,</HI> in a Treatise called the Sword of the Magistrate; and since by Mr <HI>Cobbet</HI> on the same subject.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Saints must bee considered under a double notion. 1. As Saints walking up to their principles and li|ving in the feare of God, and hee that abuseth and kils such Saints simply on this account, must look to answer for their blood.</P>
<P>But 2. Consider the Saints, as erring and wandring from their Principles, by Adultery, Murther, Drunkennesse, Here|sie, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and so they may and must be punished, though not as Saints, yet as sinning and transgressing Saints: yea
<PB N="214" REF="121">
though they should plead conscience for what they doe, and say, as Mr <HI>Bur|roughs</HI> in his <HI>Irenicum&punc; c.</HI> 6. <HI>p.</HI> 34 proves.</P>
<P>Thus you see, how Mr <HI>Webster</HI> is a|gainst learning, against <HI>Aristotle,</HI> against Magistracie, against Ministrie, against Physitians, and against all that is truly good: like <HI>Ismael,</HI> his hand is against every man, and therefore it's just that every mans hand should be against him.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But what is the summe of Mr <HI>Websters</HI> desires, and what would hee have us to studie?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Hee tels you. 1. That you must lay aside al your paper Idols, and sleight <HI>Aristotle,</HI> who hath in him, many things frivolous, vaine, false and need|lesse.</P>
<P N="2">2.

<P><PB N="215" REF="121">But Sir, if these inferiour Arts (the alwfulnesse of some of them being just|lie questionable) be so usefull and excel|lent as you affirme, then <HI>&agrave; fortior<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Logi|que</HI> (which you sleight as prejudiciall to Theology) and Physicks, Ethicks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with the superiour Arts and Scien|ces, must needs be much more excel|lent, and therefore <HI>Mr Webster</HI> is much to be blamed, for crying up those low, inferiour, emptie things; and crying downe those choice, ingenious, usefull Arts and Sciences, which doe so much fit and further men in their preparation to Divine studies.</P>
<P>To conclude, the world may here see, what stuffe still comes from Lame <HI>Giles Calvers</HI> shop, that forge of the De|vil, from whence so many blasphemous, lying, scandalous Pamphlets, for many yeers past, have spread over the Land, to the great dishonour of the Nation, in the sight of the Nations round about us, and to the provocation of Gods wrath against us, which will certainly breake forth, both upon the actors &amp; tolerators of such intollerable errours, without speedy reformation and amendment.</P>

I have neither leisure nor lust, to examine all his Examen; but yet to know <HI>Hercules</HI> by his foot, I can|not but observe&punc; how in his Chapter of Logick, he Reasons against Reason: and as <HI>Diogenes</HI> accused <HI>Plato,</HI> with a worse pride of his owne; so he prosecutes <HI>A|ristotle,</HI> under the name of Arch-So|phister, indeed with his owne sophisms; which what may we call but envy and pride, those two Mothers (saith <HI>Aqui|nas</HI>) of discord: whil'st one through en|vy, recedes from the way and will of another, through pride, to prefer his owne As <HI>Quintilian</HI> (if that Dialogue

<P>But what if Oratory be thus abused to calumniating, should there be there|fore no Oratory at all? or if Logick to cavilling, no right reason at all? as in|deed there is none such without the orderly use of it, for <HI>rationis est ordinare</HI> (saith <HI>Aquinas</HI>) and that is best done, not by the <HI>Web</HI> which is here woven, to unravell all Humane Sciences, but by the Art of Logick.

<P>But let us see, what against so glori|a light, and to falsifie the sight or sense of all ages hitherto, is here produced by him, who <HI>hoc tant&ugrave;m rectum quod sap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t ipse pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">at.</HI></P>

<P>As to that of <HI>Aristotle,</HI> for which so vehemently he inveighs against, or ra|ther proudly insults over him; the more strongly the opponent maintaines his part (for which purpose in his Topicks, he supplies him with store of Argu|ments) the respondent his, the more effectuall is their disputation, for the end thereof, <HI>viz.</HI> the di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">covery of truth: as <HI>Scaliger</HI> saith, <HI>ut ex silice &amp; ferro elicitur ignis, it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> conflictu ingeniorum veritas.</HI> And besides, in his Politicks also, he observes the rules to be kept for upholding Tyranny: but will Mr <HI>Web|ster</HI> therefore conclude, that he allows of that way of Government?</P>
<P>Sect. 2. Or is truth his owne end, in accusing whole Universities of most rationall men, and even Logick it selfe, as proceeding very preposterously, whereas, Logick is indeed the Mistriss
<PB N="221" REF="124">
of all due method to all Sciences, and to himselfe if methodicall. As if the Prince in whom as supream consists the Order of the whole community, should be ac|cused himselfe for breaking it, which as such, whether good or evil, he keeps, though if evill, not so well as he might; and by keeping his subjects in it, pre|serves them by it: for all things consist in order, which confounded, they come to naught. Logick, as such, proceeds or|derly, directing the minde in the know|ledge of truth, as first in the apprehen|sion of simple Termes, and then in the composition and division of the same, and last of all in Discourse, without confusion, falshood, or fallacy. In which last, it proceeds as well <HI>&agrave; posteriori,</HI> by induction, to find out the truth, or to know that such an affection is the true property of such a subject: as <HI>&agrave; priori,</HI> by demonstration, to perfect the know|ledge of it: for then is the knowledge distinct and perfect, when the thing is known as it is, as the effect by the cause, as it is by its cause, which is the order of Nature: and not the cause by its ef|fect, which is our Method, through the imperfection of our Intellect, deriving
<PB N="222" REF="125">
its notions from sense, and so beginning <HI>&agrave; posteriori,</HI> but <HI>&agrave; parte rei,</HI> indeed pre|posterous. First, then doth Logick pro|ceed preposterously, because to advance our Reason as neer as may bee, to the Angelicall manner of understanding, by knowing things (as they are di|stinctly and perfectly) it teacheth us to proceed in the order of Nature, or to begin <HI>&agrave; priori</HI>? 2. As to say that induction hath altogether been layed a|side, is most false, and against sense: So Reason requires that syllogismes (wherein we prove and demonstrate the effect by the cause) be preferred be|fore it. So that whilest he extols (and for a new method of his own, against all establisht and approved order) so highly cries up induction before syllo|gismes, his owne is the errour which he condemnes, and therein hee proceeds preposterously.</P>
<P>Sect. 3.

For gathering of which Notions,
<PB N="223" REF="125">
the certaine Rules which he seems to desire, but indeed rejects them, are these two. Comparison of things, as to that wherein all agree, for the community, and abstraction thereof, from differen|ces, whether essentiall or accidentall, for the unity of the simple essence, which hath thus the generall denomi|nation of an universall, and is either of one kind comprehending infinite sin|gulars, accidentally onely different, as <HI>Homo,</HI> and so is fitly exprest by the word species: or generally comprehen|sive of divers kinds, both constituted in themselves, and distinct one from ano|ther, by their proper essentiall differen|ces, as <HI>Animal, Animatum, Composi|tum, Corpus, Substantia,</HI> and so as fitly is called Genus; which is either <HI>summum,</HI> and so is not at all; as a species it selfe subordinate, as <HI>substantia,</HI> or <HI>subalter|num,</HI> which in re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pect of a superiour, Genus it selfe is a Species, and to <HI>alter|no respectu</HI> both, as <HI>Corpus, compositum, Animatum, Animal.</HI></P>
<P>The Genus then is divided into se|verall species, which are either <HI>subal|ternae,</HI> as having under them other Spe|cies, in respect whereof they are also

Genera: or <HI>infimae,</HI> as superiour to no species at all, but onely to its owne singulars; in which the division rests, as in so many Individuals.</P>
<P>Now, have we not here, both noti|ons adequate to the things, and words as fit to expresse these Notions? or in all this excellent order, can Mr <HI>Webster</HI> invent confusion?</P>

<P>Sect. 4. The said Notions, and de|terminations, concerning which, there, are given a few, plaine, ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, necessary and usefu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l Precepts, are some of the hardest passages wherein are exercised the unski<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">full and tender wits of young men: and so far are the Questions and Disputes, which are agitated by riper judgements, from derogating from their Art, that rather they add to it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Whereas here he objects that they do not see that they act as foolishly
<PB N="225" REF="126">
(even those of the best judgements) while they dispute of the very Art of Disputing, as he that endeavours to see the proper vision of his owne eye: his owne is indeed the blindnesse, in not seeing the difference of Understanding and sense.</P>
<Q>Turpe est doctori, cum culpa redar|guit ipsum.</Q>
<P>For the eye, or the outward sense, apprehends not its own Act, being nei|ther colour, nor light, nor the difference of its owne, from the proper objects of other senses. e. g. that which pronoun|ceth White to differ from sweet, is nei|ther the sight nor tast, whereof each apprehend but one of them, and so can|not judge of both 3. but the inward or common sense, as judge of the Acts and Objects of all the outward: where|as the Understanding, whose object is universall, or all things knowable, is re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|flexive to know it selfe, its owne Acts and Objects&punc; and then&punc; as the soule of man is both the Object, Subject, and Author of its owne disputes, while by reflexion, it knows it selfe. So the Lo|gician reflecting upon his owne facul|ty, may dispute of what sort it is, whe|ther
<PB N="226" REF="127">
Science or Art, which, as directing the mind by its denominations, propo|sitions, syllogismes, where the end is to act accordingly, is an Art; and yet as reflecting upon it selfe, its owne Acts and Objects, where the end is know|ledge, may be called a Science too.</P>
<P>Sect. 5. How can hee blame the Stagirite, for not defining or dispu|ting, what Logick is, what a Catego|ry is, what substance or quantity is; if herein hee should act as foolishly, as he that endeavours to see the proper vision of his owne eye. But <HI>ad rem.</HI> Neither is he indeed, nor his Interpre|ters, guilty of such defects, as here he fancies, and fastens on him, whose end is contention, to make the contention endlesse. But for the proposition and distribution, two of his subjects.</P>
<P><HI>Magnus</HI> Aristoteles <HI>trutinando ca|cumina rerum</HI>&punc;</P>
<P><HI>In duo divisit quicquid in orbe fuit.</HI></P>
<P>The members of which two heads, he handles in their order: Nor is there|fore his Organon, so organized, a confu|sed headlesse piece.</P>
<P>But such is his owne objection a|gainst his booke <HI>de Interpretatione,</HI>
<PB N="227" REF="127">
where the Moods of Propositions, are made neither more nor fewer then four, <HI>viz.</HI> necessary, impossible, possible, and contingent. For what is so plaine, as that the matter of all discourse, is either necessary, or impossible, or possible, or contingent; and so may well be redu|ced to these foure. Manners or Moods, so called, because they specifie, how the predicate belongs, or not, to the subject of the proposition; For all that we can conceive or expresse, is either necessary, if it cannot but bee, or impossible if it cannot bee, or possible, if it may be, though it be not yet, nor ever shall bee; or contingent, if it be or shall be, though it might not have been, or may never be.</P>
<P>But see here, how Mr <HI>Webster,</HI> so sub|tle and quick-sighted in seeing the De|fects of <HI>Aristotle,</HI> is blind in his owne. See it in his owne instances. Having pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mised the definition of a Mood, that it doth modificate the proposition (i) in|dicate how the predicate is in the sub|ject, he infers, and insults, may not all Adjectives by the like right be Moods? No, because they are all reduced to those foure before mentioned: but hee
<PB N="228" REF="128">
saith, if this be a Modall proposition, it is a necessary thing, that man is a living Creature, these also are Modall; it is an honest thing, that a man should be stu|dious of virtue; it's a just thing, a sonne should obey his Father; it's a gallant thing to dye for ones Country. Where, if his propositions be these, man is stu|dious of virtue, the sonne obedient to his Father, one dyes for his Country, their matter is all contingent. Or if these; man to be studious of virtue, is an honest thing, a sonne to obey his Fa|ther, a just thing, one to dye for his Country, a gallant thing; so his Adje|ctives are no Moods at all (to shew how the Predicate is in the subject) but themselves the Predicates, and in all his propositions, the matter is onely necessary.</P>
<P>So that his errour is, as if <HI>Aristotle</HI> had designed to assigne the Modall, as a distinct species of proposition, and not onely to give one generall Rule, for all the species before enumerated, as that their matter is either necessary, or im|possible, or possible, or contingent.</P>
<P>Sect. 6. Nor is he more Orthodox or busie, to better purpose, in the matter
<PB N="229" REF="128">
of definition, where the office of Lo|gick is, onely to give the Precept or Rule, how it ought to be made, which to explaine by example, it takes the instance from other Sciences: Nor is Logick to define what <HI>Homo</HI> or <HI>Ani|mal</HI> is, this being the part of Naturall Philosophy, as to treat of it's proper subject. Now the precept which Lo|gick gives for the definition of things in <HI>actu signato,</HI> as that it ought to consist of the next Genus, and a constitutive difference, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ost true, exact, and infal|lible: and therefore i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in <HI>actu exercito, animal rationale,</HI> be not indeed the true definition of man, the errour is the Phi|losophers, who must find out for his owne subject, the next Genus, and con|stitutive difference (as <HI>religiosum,</HI> or the like, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> not <HI>rational<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>) according to the Rules and Precepts, which in Lo|gick he hath for both; to make (by the Rules for that too) the definition ex|act and perfect: So that the same which Mr <HI>Webster</HI> before objected against Lo|gicians, as that they seem to make Lo|gick a part of Physicks, hee is guilty of here himselfe.</P>
<P>But because as an open enemy to
<PB N="230" REF="129">
our Physicks, as well as our Logick, he would equally glory in the defects and errours of both; the truth is that the errour is all his owne: for that bruit beasts are irrationall creatures, and so rationall the proper difference of man, it appeares. 1. By comparing, as man with Angels, so the said bruits with man: For Angels are intuitive, meere or simple intelligences, as seeing both in the sight of the subject, what is attribu|ted or denyed to it without compositi|on or division: and in the sight of the Principle, what flowes from it without discourse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and so we men also are intel|ligent creatures, but not as Angels, the operation of whose Intellect, is onely the apprehension of simple termes, and not lyable to falshood; for besides that we have two other, to compound or divide, and to discourse, and so are ra|tionall too; which being thus our essen|tiall difference, little lower then the Angels, is yet common to us with bruit beasts.</P>
<P N="2">2. That <HI>Rationale</HI> is not a graduall onely, but our essentiall difference, it is evident at least by this, that whereas <HI>Gradus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on variat speciem,</HI> in us specifi|cally
<PB N="231" REF="129">
distinct, is the principle of reason, from any in bruit beasts, as appeares <NOTE PLACE="marg">As Mr <HI>Webster</HI> saith, that wee know nothing in nature, but <HI>&agrave; posteriore,</HI> and from the affe|ctions and properties of things must seek for their causes.</NOTE> <HI>&agrave; posteriori,</HI> by the properties of it, as ap|titude to speak, &amp;c. which we have as rationall.</P>
<P>And whereas further he saith, that irrationall is negative, and so can posi|tively prove nothing. This his sequell were true, if it were negative <HI>secundum rem</HI> and not onely <HI>se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">undum <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ocem.</HI> e.g. immortall is also negative, and yet if St <HI>Pauls</HI> Argument from the word mortall, be of force, when he saith, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> not sinne raign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in your mortall bodi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI>; how much more is that of St <HI>Peter&punc; abstaine from fleshly lusts, which warre against your [immortall] soules.</HI></P>
<P>Now as immortall (applyed to God, Angels, and the reasonable souls of men) implyes more then a meere negation of dying, for otherwise, all things but li|ving creatures, should be imortall. So irrationall, speaks the positive and spe|cificall nature of a bruit beast, as rati|onall, that of man, though in so great a scarcity and inequality of words to things we bee destitute of a better way to expresse the same: for why doe wee say, that the Ox<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is irrationall, and not
<PB N="232" REF="130">
as well that the stone is so, since the negative of reason in both is alike, and the habit undue to both; but that irrati|onall&punc; implyes&punc; that positive Nature, whereof the one is partaker, and not the other.</P>
<P N="2">2. I should wonder that one who is so contentious, seeking all occasions to cavill, should omit division; were it not hereby evident, that hee hath no|thing to say against it.</P>
<P>But why doth hee make such hast in his wrath against Reason, to come to Argumentation? or what can be made more absolute (without addition or alteration by some curious wits, in so many ages of men) or so exact as our Art of syllogizing. But Novelists moved with the spirit of pride and envy, are out of love as with all that others have invented, and not themselves, so even most with the best, for the greater glo|ry of reformation. Yea whereas other inventions are concerning such out|ward things&punc; as we use more seldome, wee have continuall use of our owne Reason&punc; and yet still is our Art of syllo|gizing, so imperfect a thing, that now one should presume to abrogate it? He
<PB N="233" REF="130">
mislikes, that so many sorts of our syllo|gismes conclude negatively, since it is sufficiently known, that <HI>de negativis non da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r scientia&punc;</HI> but doth he not know as well, that <HI>por negativa datur</HI>? yea, himselfe saith, and alledgeth his Au|thor for it, that humane Science doth consist in a certaine negation of falsity, rather then in the affirmation of veri|ty.</P>
<P>It is undenyably true (saith he) that the knowledge of the premises is more certaine, then the knowledge of the conclusion, and therefore undoubtedly certaine, that the knowledge of the conformity, betwixt the premises and the conclusion, doth praeexist in us; where both the consequent may bee true, and the antecedent; but how doe they hang together? Grammatically indeed in the Copulative words, <HI>and therefore:</HI> but hee defies all Logicall wayes of Arguing. Or how is it that the said knowledge before, and without the syllogisme, may bee said to be, or praeexist in us? not in Act, but onely in aptitude (as <NOTE PLACE="marg">Alex. Alens<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Metaphys.</HI></NOTE> one saith, that <HI>aptitudo ad rem est aliquid ipsius rei</HI>;) which aptitude is reduced to Act (without
<PB N="234" REF="131">
which it should bee in vaine) or the knowledge (saith Mr <HI>Webster</HI> himselfe) excited by syllogizing; and yet is syl|logizing also in vaine? or in procuring that act, uselesse? else why doth he say, and therefore why dost thou torment and macerate thy selfe in that question, which is more subtile to despise then to dissolve? which (since nothing can bee inferred from a thing wherein it is not contained) is another <HI>therefore</HI> without inference&punc; subtilty beyond sense, and a sleighting or despising (not of some vaine questi|on, but) of so useful a thing, as the best of Logick it selfe, against reason.</P>
<P><HI>Ob.</HI> And so is that which here hee objects, saying, that sometimes from false premises, there doth follow a true conclusion, as in this syllogisme,
<Q><L>Nullum adorabile est Creator,</L>
<L>Omne simulacrum est adcrabile, <HI>Ergo,</HI></L>
<L>Nullum simulacrum est Creator.</L></Q></P>
<P>Nor can it therefore be judged, that the conclusion of syllogismes, doth of necessity compell Assent, or that the
<PB N="235" REF="131">
conclusion doth necessarily depend up|on the premises, as the truth is not con|tained in a lye, nor the knowledge of it.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1. We say not that that in syllo|gisms, which of necessity compels, assent is the conclusion it selfe, but the premi|ses, when out of them it is rightly pro|ved (i) when the premises both are true and well ordered in Mood and fi|gure, Assent to the conclusion is made necessary; for <HI>ex veris nil nisi verum,</HI> and that by vertue of the right order and disposition in Mood and Figure, for otherwise out of true premises, there may follow a false conclusion: as
<Q><L>Omnis asinus est animal,</L>
<L>Omnis homo est animal, <HI>Ergo,</HI></L>
<L>Omnis homo est asinus.</L></Q></P>
<P>So then we are taught in the first and second part of our Logick, to make the premises true, and in the third, so to dis|pose and order them, as to necessitate Assent to that, which we make our con|clusion from; and yet is all this so despi|cable, that Mr <HI>Webster</HI> extolling his owne subtlety, and the force of his Un|derstanding,
<PB N="236" REF="132">
should not onely, not seek, but reject it's true helpes?</P>
<P N="2">2. The conclusion indeed doth ne|cessarily depend upon the premises, in respect of the forme at least, as the con|clusion of a true syllogisme, and so doth that of his syllogisme before mentio|ned: or in respect of the matter too, as a true conclusion&punc; and so not.</P>
<P N="3">3. Whereas it is objected, that as the truth is not contained in a lye, so no more is that true conclusion in the false premises.</P>
<P>The premises both are true (i) they are true propositions for the substance, categoricall, for the quantity univer|sall, for the quality, <HI>vocis</HI>; the one Ne|gative, the other Affirmative; and <HI>re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> both false; yea even because false, they are therefore true propositions. For in simple termes, and in speeches not e|nuntiative, there is neither <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">alshood nor Truth; but if you make <HI>Homo,</HI> or <HI>homo albus,</HI> either true or false, you make a true proposition of it; and if to one such, you add another in Mood, and Figure, there is true disposition too, for a true syllogisme. So that even the true conclusion of false premises is
<PB N="237" REF="132">
contained in and deduced out of them, in respect of the forme, for so are they also true&punc; though not in respect of the matter, since that is false.</P>
<P>Lastly, To all that in the residue of the Chapter, he objects or cavils against Lo|gick, may that serve, which before was answered? as that by direction thereof wee doe defend the truth, as the true definitions of things, and infer out of true premises, rightly ordered, undeni|able conclusions, whereby wee have not onely bare Opinations, Putations, or probable Conjectures; but infallible Science, and Apodicticall to informe and satisfie the Intellect, by evidentiall demonstration.</P>
<P>Whereas Mr <HI>Webster</HI> cavilling a|gainst all reason, contradicts and con|founds his owne. As first, when he saith [<HI>Numb.</HI> 4.] a Chymist when he shews me the preparation of the Sulphur of Acrimony, the Salt of Tartar, the Spirit of Vitrioll and the uses of them, he tea|cheth me that knowledge, which I was ignorant of before, the like of which no Logick ever performed: having said immediately before, that demonstrati|on, and the knowledge of it, is in the
<PB N="238" REF="133">
Teacher, in whom it serves to demon|strate and to shew it others, who learn it of him. Againe [<HI>Num.</HI> 5.] he con|demnes all Logick, as conducing to no other knowledge, then such as is duely probable and conjecturall; as if that were not more then such, which is ac|quired by demonstration.</P>
<P>Besides, he most highly extols Astro|logy, and the now Professors thereof, his friends, as common enemies with him, as well even to Divinity it selfe, as to Logick and humane learning; who presume by their Art, to foretell <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">As the fall of Law and Di|vinity.</NOTE> such future contingencies, as depending on mans free will, are not known to An|gels themselves, unlesse by <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Durand</HI> and others.</NOTE> conjecture onely, or revelation. And have any the best Astrologers, so cleare a Light, as to see by the Heavens more, then these Heavenly lights themselves, or as Mr <HI>Webster,</HI> then all wise men? Yea how grossely have they failed in things even meerly naturall, conjecturing at <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">As Mr <HI>San|ders,</HI> one of the most learned of them.</NOTE> raine and showers, during all the late winter drought; but not at all of the later rain, as if God had provided both to disco|ver their grand Imposturage and pre|sumption, if not impiety, in taking men
<PB N="239" REF="133">
off from himselfe the first, to ascribe all or too much to Nature, and second causes.</P>
<P>All which is to me, a sufficient evi|dence, that this great Examiner, not|withstanding his faire pretences of Re|formation and truth, might, if thorough|ly examined himself, be found not stee|ring his course indeed by right zeale to these,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In his Epistle Dedie.</NOTE> but by that which he also seems to disclaime, even selfe-interest.</P>
<P>However, certaine it is, that truth or reformation, cannot be truly sought in a way against Nature as is here Mr <HI>Web|sters</HI> in preferring himselfe, before all the wisest and best in all Ages, to inform and Reforme his Mothers, the Univer|sities; for
