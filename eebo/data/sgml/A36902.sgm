<HEAD>AN
HUE and CRY
After
CONSCIENCE:
OR,
The Pilgrims search after
Honesty and Plain-dealing.</HEAD>
<P>MUsing with my self one day, how un|prosperous
<HI>Vertue</HI> and her atten|dants
were in the World, and how <HI>Vice</HI>
Triumphed every where; the thought
possessed me with a <HI>Melancholy damp</HI> that
sat heavy on my mind; to divert which, I
could imagine no better expedient, than
to wander in solitary places, and condole
the unhappy estate of erring Mortals.
When <HI>Travelling</HI> towards the private re|cess
of nature, I was somewhat refreshed
with the fragancy of the Fields and
Groves, who breathed sweet Odors,
whilst the Winged Choirestors from eve|ry
Bough and Blooming Shrub, warbled
tribute Praises to their Maker, and all the
fleecy Flocks that spread the <HI>Flowry Plains</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="6">
expressed their bleating joy, cheared with
the Morning Sun, whose thristy Beams
drunk up the Pearly Dew, the considera|tion
of which incited me to contemplate
the Harmony and order of the Creation;
how from the Worlds Original all Crea|tures
<HI>(Man excepted)</HI> have made good the
ends to which they were Created: And
that he alone, who is so proud of being
<HI>Rational,</HI> should suffer himself to sink be|neath
the meanest Animal, in dissenting
from the will of his Creator.</P>
<P><HI>Whilst these Imaginations</HI> run strongly in
my mind, a <HI>sudden drowsiness</HI> sat heavy on
my-Eyes, and as it were compelled me to
repose on <HI>a Grassy Bed, inameld with Na|tures
sweets,</HI> and far removed from noise
and clamour, that still reign in places
Populous, where giving way to the soft
Charmer, soon <HI>I fell a sleep, and sleeping
dreamed a Dream.</HI> I dreamed, and be|hold
a Man stood by me, whose Eyes see|med
brighter than the Morning Star, more
piercing than the sight of Eagles, on his
Brows sat <HI>Gravity and Wisdom,</HI> and in his
front in mistick Characters understanding
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">eep Ingraven, and as he stood he lifted
up his voice, and cryed, <HI>The Secreis of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> are before me, he that will</HI> DISCO|VER
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"> follow the Light of vnderstand|ing.</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="6">
And when he had cryed, I saw in my
Dream a light spring up, as of <HI>a Burning
Tapor,</HI> whose brightness dazled my Eyes,
<HI>which he taking in his Hand,</HI> moved a soft|ly
pace towards a <HI>Spacious City,</HI> whose
glittering <HI>Piramides</HI> reflected the Sun
Beams, and as he moved by a strang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
Sympathy, methought he drew me after
him, nor was I displeased, as being much
desirous to see the end, or what the Ap|parition
(for so I conceived it at first)
could make out of wonder or unusual my|stery.
When coming to the Gates, I
heard a doleful wailing, and looking up
beheld a Woman cloath'd in raggs, mea|ger
as Famine, for her Eyes were sunk,
her withered Breasts hung down, and on
her faded Cheecks <HI>want</HI> and <HI>necessity</HI> im|pressed
their Seals, and after her cry'd
many Infants for their dayly food, but
all in vain, for I perceived she had nought
to feed them with but Tears, which flow|ed
in <HI>Rivolets.</HI> She had it seems been
round the World to ease her mysery, but
found no relief, for every where the Door
was shut against her, by reason Avarice
her Mortal Enemy, had incenced Mankind
to cast her off, vowing her destruction,
for opposing his incroachments in the
days of old. She passed us, and I looking
<PB N="4" REF="7">
after her, as grieved at such a sight, saw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
<HI>Charity</HI> in <HI>Hebrew</HI> Characters, inwove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
on her <HI>tattered Garments,</HI> whereat I sighed
and thus expressed my self.
<Q><L>Hard fate said I, that she who was admir'd</L>
<L>In days of old, and decently attir'd,</L>
<L>Wellcom'd in every place, made the de|light,</L>
<L>And darling of Man-kind thus put to
flight,</L>
<L>Shou'd feed on Air, and dwell in shades
of night.</L></Q>
I would have proceeded, but was put be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">sides
my intention upon the approach of a
Female form half naked, who with ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tended

though in vain, for still the vapours fle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">

that intimated she had a long tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">

her a <HI>prospect</HI> of many desireable things
with a promise that she should posse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="5" REF="7">
them, but after all left her upon the bor|ders
of the Land of <HI>Doubting,</HI> where she
had yet some glimering of light, and ima|gined
she saw things <HI>at a distance,</HI> which
she was hasting towards, as eagerly de|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">iring
to possess them. Now in my <HI>Dream</HI>
I perceived she had not passed above a fur|long,
but she entered a dark Region,
called, the <HI>Province of Despair,</HI> and there
continued wandring in the Air, till the
dissolved to <HI>nothing,</HI> but as she glided along
on her Garments, which were made of
the Skins of <HI>Cammelions,</HI> her name was
written in the Colour of an evening Mist,
by which I understood she was <HI>Hope,</HI> and
pondering with my self, I imagined I had
once been familiar with her, but seeing
how she lost her self, in vainly placing
her mind on things below, I thus discanted.
<Q><L>When <HI>Hope</HI> on Worldly things her mind
does place,</L>
<L>She feeds on Air, and only shades does
chace;</L>
<L>Yet Flatt'ry leads her on, till she at last</L>
<L>Doubting, her self upon Despair does
cast,</L>
<L>Who makes her nothing, or does chain
her fast.</L></Q>
<PB N="6" REF="8">
By this time methought we had passed the
<HI>Gate,</HI> and the <HI>Prespect represented many
stately Buildings,</HI> replenished with Inhabi|tants
of all <HI>Crafts</HI> and <HI>Occupations,</HI> with
every thing desireable for the support of
life, and to gratifie the expectations of
those that Worldly pomp and pajentry
delight, more than sollid joys, when me|thought
I was very desirous to know who
it was that like a <HI>Load-stone</HI> drew me af|ter
him, which <HI>the Man perceiving</HI> by the
earnestness of my countenance, pulled
out <HI>a Scrole,</HI> and opening it, I read there|in
many wonderful things, and conceived
them to be true, because they were deli|vered
under the Seal of <HI>Wisdom,</HI> chief Se|cretary
to <HI>Vnderstanding,</HI> and upon the
Back-side was written in Letters of Gold
DISCOVERY, which he told me
was his Name, and that <HI>Wisdom</HI> whose
Servant he was, had sent him from the
Land of <HI>knowledge,</HI> to discover the ways
of <HI>vice</HI> and <HI>folly,</HI> who have of late made
many inroads into the Region of <HI>vertue</HI>
and <HI>understanding;</HI> where assisted by <HI>Flat|tery</HI>
and <HI>Dissimulation,</HI> they have alinated
divers from ways of <HI>Honesty</HI> and <HI>Plain-dealing,</HI>
paths now allmost unfrequen|ted
and over-grown with Moss,
which in the days of old were wont
<PB N="7" REF="8">
to be fill'd with <HI>Iustling Crouds,</HI> who fre|quently
contended for the way. Being
thus far satisfied, I was about to give my
opinion concerning his undertaking, and
to inform him what little satisfaction such
a discovery would give the World, as now
it stands, but had not time before in my
<HI>Dream;</HI> I beheld an <HI>Image pale</HI> as Death,
with trembling Steps and fluttering wings,
advancing towards us, deeply sighing and
complaining of the hard usage it had met
with from <HI>Ingratitude, Avarice,</HI> and <HI>Ex|tortion,</HI>
with divers others, who for the
good Offices it attemped to do them, had
often put it to torture by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">earing it with
<HI>hot Irons,</HI> scosing and laughing it to scorn;
nay made an Invasion upon it's <HI>life,</HI> by in|deavoring
to <HI>smother and stifle it;</HI> which it
had a long time born in hopes to prevaile
by mild perswasions and meekness, against
such rash proceeding; but in the end be|ing
used worse and worse, and beginning
to complain of such out rages to the Maker
of the World, whose Steward she is. A
Pestilent Fellow called <HI>Atheism,</HI> who has
lately <HI>Invaded Sion,</HI> councelled those with
whom I lived to turn me out of doors,
whose council they gladly Embraced, hard|ning
their hearts to that degree, that they
became <HI>stones,</HI> which I perceiving and
<PB N="8" REF="9">
finding I could not live on such Diet, I as
willingly consented to leave e'm, and am
now going to the <HI>Celestial City,</HI> to give an
account of my <HI>Steward-ship,</HI> where I doubt
not but I shall find better reception. Now
whilst I was wondering who this should be
<HI>Discovery</HI> whispers me in the Ear and told
me it was <HI>Conscience;</HI> how <HI>Conscience</HI> said
I, and with that I cryed out, <HI>O Ingrateful
world, and art thou treated so, who oughtest
to be the square and ballance of Good men, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">egulator of the actions of the just, thou true
Essential good! thou Soul of virtue! and thou
Ray divine!</HI></P>
<P>Now in my Dream methought I was a|bout
to Embrace her, but like a <HI>shade</HI> she
flew from my extended Arms, and <HI>vanish|ed
in a Mist:</HI> yet in token of her kindness,
left a strong <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">pression of her tender|ness
upon my Soul, which made me break
into this Rapture:
<Q><L>Wilt thou blest Guider of our ways be gone,</L>
<L>Like Heaven's swift flame, no sooner blaze
but done;</L>
<L>Return, return, thou Comfort of mankind,</L>
<L>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t some at least so great a blessing find,</L>
<L>Let some have light, though half the
world be blind.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="9">Scarce had I ended, when in my Dream
I beheld <HI>two men</HI> coming towards us
Laughing as loud as possible, whose un|seasonable
Mirth, <HI>DISCOVERY</HI> note|ing,
and knowing they trod the paths of
Unrighteousness, cryed out, <HI>woe be to you
that laugh now, for you shall weep hereafter.</HI>
This put me upon the Inquiry, when I
was quickly informed they were <HI>Vsery</HI>

Agents in starving out <HI>Charity,</HI> deluding
of <HI>Hope,</HI> and banishing of <HI>Conscience.</HI> By

<P>Why first I ask'd her if she had no|thing
but hopes to live upon, for if you
han't said I, you must take up with the

<P>She told me she hop'd better, and she
<PB N="12" REF="11">
hop'd I would lend her some money.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ext.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay said I, if you have any Land
to Mortgage, Plate or Jewels to Pawn or
so.</P>
</SP>

<P>She hop'd, she said, she should have
both. Then said I, I hope you'l be gone and
trouble me no more, till that day comes for
no <HI>Penny no Paternoster,</HI> and with that she
went sighing out of my Shop: and I believe
by this time she finds that her hopes are vain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ext.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay doubtless, but she that trou|bled
us most in the dawn of our undertak|ings.
Was <HI>Conscience</HI> sawcy? <HI>Conscience,</HI>
who wou'd ever be rebelling against our
Inclynations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Use.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay indeed, I for my part found her
very troublesome, although I had her in a
<HI>Kerb-Bridle;</HI> for when she saw me in a thri|ving
way, by lending money upon Bond and
Iudgement, and within a day or two, or so,
sease upon all my Chapmen had, and clap him
into the Bilboes to make him sell or mortgage
his Land. She would tell me of <HI>grinding
the Face of the Poor,</HI> and begin to check
me at a strange rate, for which unseasonable
sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">cyness I have knock'd her down twenty
times in a day, yet she would still be Rebel|ling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ext.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I think I used her severely
enough before I could be rid on her; ne|ver
<PB N="13" REF="11">
were <HI>Bees</HI> smoaked with Brimstone, as
I smoaked her with the fuel of Obstinacy,
by stopping my Ears to her Clamour, and
contradicting her in all her motions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Use.</SPEAKER>
<P>She was no fit Companion for us, for
she would often be talking of Heaven and Hell,
and urging Scripture to us, as if we minded
that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ext.</SPEAKER>
<P>And presenting us with Widdows
and Orpheans tears, the crys of the op|pressed,
and the distress of those we have
genteely out witted and gulled of their
Estates, with twenty the like trivial mat|ters;
but since we are rid of her no more
on't.</P>
<P>Now I saw in my Dream that <HI>Discovery</HI>
came near and interrupted their dis|course,

<P>If we are! Why what if we are,

<SPEAKER>Vse.</SPEAKER>
<P>No indeed Sir, they are none of
<PB N="14" REF="12">
our Acquaintance, nor do we desire they
should; they were our Neighbours once,
but proved so unprofitable and trouble|some,
that none of our profession cared
for living by 'em: So we together with
our Brethren of the faculty, got a decree
to banish 'em out of all places where we
were Concerned; and now I believe it
will be a hard matter to find 'em in these
parts, for as I take it, <HI>they talk'd of Iour|neying
to</HI> America, <HI>to take up with the Na|tive</HI>

'em.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Disc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray Gentlemen of what Profession
are you, that <HI>Plain Dealing</HI> and <HI>Honesty</HI>
should be so offensive to you, I'le assure you, I
have heard a very good Character of 'em in
the days of Old.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ext.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay Friend it may be so, but those
days are past, and we know better things
for all that, than to have any thing to do
with 'em,&mdash;a couple of sneaking Fellows
as they are; I am sure I am five hundred
Pounds the worse for the little Society I
had with 'em, and I believe my Brother
here is little less, for we are Trades-men
if it please you Sir.</P>
</SP>

<P><HI>But know you not that</HI> the way of
the Wicked shall not prosper, <HI>and that</HI>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ext.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! What dos he talk Scripture
to us?&mdash;Stay let us see,&mdash;who can this
be?&mdash;Uds-lid 'tis the Ghost of <HI>Conscience</HI>
in Disguise, with a Candle in her hand,
Fly, fly I say, least she again possess us,
and trouble us worse than ever.</P>
<P>Now I beheld in my Dream, that they
hasted to a gloomy coverture <HI>loving dark|ness,
rather then light, because their deeds
were evil.</HI> And we passed on to another
Path of the City, which by the many In|dentures
that stuck up in the Windows, I
conceited to be <HI>Sheep-Skin Row,</HI> where I be|held
a man coming out of a dark place
with a Libel in his Mouth, and on it was
Written in a mixture of Letters, <HI>Forge|ry,</HI>
being habited like a Scribe, for his
Coat was Laced with the defrauded Or|phans
Sighs, and Spangled with Widdows
Tears; wherefore I conceived it vain to
inquire for <HI>Hones<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">y</HI> or <HI>Plain Dealing</HI> in
that place, and would have passed him,
but <HI>Discovery</HI> would needs discourse him:
Now I perceived when he Addressed him|self,
the man started to meet a Person at
<PB N="16" REF="13">
noon day with a light in his hand, as
doubting it might be <HI>Diogenes</HI> in search of
an honest man, and would have turned out
of the way, but that he imagined <HI>Consci|ence</HI>
lay sculking on the other side in a dark
Celler, whose greeting he dreaded more
than <HI>an Army with Banners;</HI> and therefore
altering his resolves, he came blundering
on, when thus I fancy'd I heard 'em Dia|logue.</P>

<P>And how came you off in that case?
It must certainly be known in the end.</P>

<P>O never Sir! For I repayed the
Money, and took up my Mortgage after I
had used it as long as my occasions requi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">d.
But now I think further Sir I must
bid you adieu. Oh Dear! I had almost
<PB N="18" REF="14">
forgot, I should have been at Mr. <HI>Knave|ries</HI>
two hours since, to affix a Hand and
Seal to a band of 1000 L. by way of imi|tation&mdash;Your Servant Sir.</P>
<P>Now in my Dream I beheld he hasted
towards the Castle of <HI>Deceit,</HI> whereupon
we inquired at Mr. <HI>Simplicities</HI> as we were
directed; but instead of <HI>Honesty</HI> and <HI>Plain-dealing,</HI>
we found <HI>Folly</HI> and <HI>Ignorance,</HI> sit|ting
in two wicker Chairs, in great State,
and about them many attendance who
waited by turns, but having no business
with them, we hasted to <HI>Papers-tree,</HI> a
place for many Letters famed through the
World, and there we found a grave Per|son
sitting in a Volumnious place, incom|passed
with the labours of 5000 Mortals,
Antient and Modern, here or no where
thought I we may be informed, and by the
information cease our further search, but
my expectation failed, for I found soon
after that the Mans Head was wonderous
Airey, being made up for the most part
of Romance and strange imagination, yet
<HI>Discovery</HI> would inquire, though I had be|fore
informed him, he would loose his la|bour.
Now at his approach I perceived
the Man was not a little affrighted, for
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>ground,</HI> he imagined
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> might be the Ghost of some deceased
<PB N="19" REF="14">
Author whom he had Hackneyd to death;
but finding his mistake, and recollecting
himself, he pull'd of his Hat, and made
a crindging congie, which gave me op|portunity
to discern <HI>Self-Interest,</HI> in large
Characters on his forehead, but <HI>Discovery</HI>
not presently perceiving it, fell to asking
him many Questions, as thus.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Discovery.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir does this place call you
Master, know you all your Neighbours here
about?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Self-Interest.</SPEAKER>
<P>To both I answer in the
affirmative, but pray Sir why inquire
you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Disc.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis some thing I want that makes
me so inquisitive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Self-Int.</SPEAKER>
<P>If wares you want of this kind
I can furnish you with all Sorts, I have
what you please, you see not half my store,
will it please you to walk further.</P>
<P>Now I perceived <HI>Discovery</HI> had a mind
to enter his Cabinet of Rarities as he
term'd it, to make some observations,
which willingness he perceiving, he lead
us into a dark entery, crouded on either
side with Leather and Past-board, where
by the light <HI>Discovery</HI> brought, I beheld
<HI>Rebellious Principles</HI> peep out at one Cor|ner,
<HI>Sedition</HI> at an other, <HI>false Doctrine</HI>
stood there Triumphant, and the <HI>Italian
<PB N="20" REF="15">
Art</HI> of <HI>Poisoning</HI> barefaced, <HI>Mahomet</HI> was
rank'd with the <HI>Prophets,</HI> and old <HI>Hobbs</HI>
with the Evangelists, <HI>Mugletons</HI> Sermons
lurked in private, and the rank Weeds of
<HI>Atheism</HI> reached the ceeling, <HI>Debauchery</HI>
the baen of youth, took up a shelf for her
own conveniency, and <HI>Arian Heresy</HI> was
rampant, on the other side were musty
<HI>Legends,</HI> beautified with the conveniency
of a new Title, promising wonderous
things, though not one word in the fol|lowing
pages, and next them stood <HI>In|croachments</HI>
upon the proprieties of his
Breathren in iniquity, and an <HI>Additional
Impression</HI> in Partner-ship, seal'd with the
Ignorance of his <HI>Coleague.</HI> And for all this
was he taken for a Saint and a <HI>Hero,</HI> but
when as you may perceive the light of <HI>Vn|derstanding</HI>
came to Scrutenize him, all
prov'd otherwise.</P>
<P>Now I dreamed that <HI>Discovery</HI> began to
ask him other questions, but especially if
he was acquainted with <HI>Honesty</HI> and <HI>Plain-dealing,</HI>
or knew the place of their aboad,
but he protested he was altogither igno|rant
of them, only had read that they were
many years since Familiar Companions
with divers of the <HI>Philosophers,</HI> and some
few of the <HI>Hermites,</HI> as for himself, he said
he managed his Trade well enough and
<PB N="21" REF="15">
needed not their assistance, and finding we
were not Chapmen for his turn, he whist|led
for a drudg in Petty-coats, and telling
us his Dinner cool'd by this delay, dis|mis'd
us with, <HI>your Humble Servant Gen|tlemen.</HI></P>
<P>Thus far travelling in vain, me thought
I began to be weary, and intreating <HI>Dis|covery</HI>
to stay a while, sat me down on a
pair of stairs to rest my self, where I had
not been long, but I heard a noise above
accompany'd with divers imperfect mur|mours,
which at first I took for a <HI>Leet,</HI>
or Court of <HI>Pypouder;</HI> but hearing at the
same time a knocking, and the noise re|newed
of <HI>two pence, three pence, who bids
more.</HI> I verily believe they were exposing
<HI>Honesty</HI> to sale by Inch of Candle, by rea|son
of the lowness of the rate: Desirous
to be informed I intreated <HI>Discovery</HI> to
accompany me into this place of clamour
who consenting, we no sooner came to
the top of the ascent, but we beheld a <HI>De|minitive
Fellow,</HI> with staring Eyes, Hair
tuckt up, and his Mouth drawn from Ear
to Ear, standing in a kind of a Tubb or
<HI>Quakers Pulpit,</HI> with a Book in his Hand,
as if he intended to edifie the People that
were grumbling out their Sentiments,
when all on a sudden opening as loud as
<PB N="22" REF="16">
<HI>Mugleton</HI> in the height of his damning
dayes, and whilst the Auditory stood with
their Mouths at half cock, expecting the
issue of a long preamble, comes to the
Text and cryes, <HI>Here Gentlemen you have
the true Art of</HI> Phoenix <HI>catching, and infal|liable
Receipts for the Philosophers Stone,
here are directions how to make Pearls of Dew
drops, and how a Man by easily stopping all
the Rivers that run into the Ocean, may
drain it, and catch</HI> Whales <HI>dry shod, with|out
the tediousness of a</HI> Greenland <HI>Voyage.
By this an old Woman of fourscore may be di|rected
to restore her self to fifteen, and young
Gentlemen who have made over their Estates
by conveyance, find means to wrest them out
of the Hands of a griple Vserer. He that has
a generous flame for learning, let him buy
this, and he's made for ever.</HI> But if any of
you have good Money in your Poc|kets
and yet will starve your Brains, you

<P>Now in my Dream I beheld they all
crowded about the party that had bought
this supposed piece of rarety, and what
shou'd it be but <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">m Thumb</HI> in Folio with
<PB N="23" REF="16">
Marginal Notes, whereat the buyer per|ceiving
his Mountain expectations, had
brought forth a Mouse sneak'd away like
a Cur that had lost his Tail, here I fur|ther
observed that when any Book of va|lue
through defect of bidding was likely
to go under rate, the Supervizor of these
fallacies had one at Hand to save it by
bidding higher, or inflaming the bidders
in emulation to each other, advancing it
at it's double value, and if inquiry be
made for whom he Purchases, he has a
name at his Tongues end, pretending a
commission, but all is false, for in the end the
Books return'd from whence it came: Now
in one corner of the Room, I perceived
<HI>Deceit</HI> lay lurking close, but <HI>Folly</HI> flew
about on Wings of <HI>Ignorance,</HI> and <HI>Self-conceit</HI>
prompting the eager multi|tude
to purchase Books at a third
part dearer than their Neighbours
would afford the very same Books;
for but that that sets 'em agoing, is the
rumour of some eminent mans choice,
<HI>Library</HI> Books, which the Ignorant
imagine are no where to be found but
there, when in plain <HI>English,</HI> this Emi|nent
mans <HI>Library</HI> is the Bookseller him|self,
and no body else: Wherefore dis|pairing
to find <HI>Honesty</HI> and <HI>Plain Dealing</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="17">
in this place, we never so much as made
inquiry, but en'e trudged down the same
way we came up, but scarce had time to
take the Aire. When in my <HI>Dream</HI> I be|held
a man coming out of a Dirty place,
rubing his Nose with a pair of dark co|lourd
Hands, his Visage was grim, and
looking this way and that way, as if he
feared some danger, clap'd down a Trap-door
after him, and so came towards us,
giving us a full but before he was aware,
which made him retreat six or seven pa|ces,
and there making a full stop, stood
peering at us, for having been so long in
the dark, or at least by Candle-light, I
perceived he was grown mope Eyed: But
<HI>Discovery</HI> desirous to unravel him, began
to Sift him in this manner:</P>

<P>Now in my Dream I beheld the man
tremble and shake, looking this way and

done many things for some great men of
the <HI>Paper professors,</HI> that have procured
'em a Vension Pasty on a Holy day, or
so; though when they came to the touch
Stone, they had the face to disown 'em,
and made me <HI>Iack hold their staff:</HI> Many
a time have I heard a. <HI>HOG</HI> in Armour
grunting about my Trap-door, but was
not able to turn it up with his Snout: Ay
many a fair business have I done for my
self, for when I saw my Patrons in part|nership
for Supernumerarys, unknown to

Supernumerated 'em both, and that I

<P>Has <HI>Plain-dealing</HI> nothing neither

</SP>
<SP>

<P>No I think not, for should he once
come amongst us, all of our Trade have
such an Antipathy against him, that he'd
either be knockt o'th head with the Barr,

<P>O Yess, a very dang'rous one; why it

it appeared they were dreadful, for they
then shook the Islands: But I can stay no

<P>Now in my Dream I beheld the man
left us and slunk into a dark Entery, which
it seems was a thorowfare, leading to the
Land of Blackness, so that we saw him no
more: But as <HI>Discovery</HI> conversed with
him, I saw the word <HI>Imprinted</HI> pined on
his sleeve, from whence I conceited him
a <HI>Typographer,</HI> and from that time forward,
named him the <HI>Engin of Dissention.</HI> But
we had not gone far er'e we came into
<HI>Feigning Street,</HI> and this I perceived was
chiefly inhabited by <HI>Hypocricy,</HI> who had a
World of votarys, and a train of green
approv'd Sinners to wait on her when ever
she had a mind to take the Aire, for you
must know this is represented as a Female
Iniquity, though too frequently incident
to either Sex; She's a great enemy to
<HI>Faith,</HI> and the only Sister to <HI>Dissimulation;</HI>
she was dressed in the Habit of a <HI>Nun,</HI>
pretending to the greatest strictness ima|ginable,
her Cheeks were furrow'd with
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">asting Spittle, which many took for tears,
sighs she had ever at command, and eve|ry
now and then would strain a gentle
<PB N="29" REF="19">
groan, and would be still reproving Vice
in those that were most vertuous and sin|cere,
talk much of watching, fasting,
Prayer and Alms; but all this talk was
but in publique to gain Applause or Inte|rest
for in private, and with those she
durst trust with the Secret, she would re|vel
it all day, and in Adulterous Arms
spend many a night, counting Religion
than a Ceremony, a meer shade: She's
much in fashion w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">th our modern Strum|pets,

<PB N="34" REF="22">
lifting up my Eyes and finding my self in
a spacious Meadow, I was fully convin|ced
that all that had passed was but a
Dream. The birth of Imagination Mid|wif'd
by fancy, proceeding from the ram|blings
of the Soul, which in its eternal
Wake makes strange discoveries; but
long these thoughts had not travers'd my
more Capacious understanding, e're sleep
that Emblem of Death courted my Eye|lids
afresh, and in his carresses grasped
them so hard that my Sences melted in the
Arms of sweet Repose. When I Dream|ed
and beheld in my Dream that sundry
Phantasius were triping round me, repre|senting,
<HI>Folly, Iealouzie, Self-conceit, Pride,
Ambition,</HI> and a thousand such like Airey
vanities; but whilst I was making obser|vations
on their many antick shapes and
studdied postures, the Curtain was drawn
before the Queen of <HI>Faryland,</HI> whose
Pallace is called the Castle of <HI>Delusion,</HI> a
strong place, to which many give them|selves
up voluntary prisoners, where they
wander from Room to Room; lead con|tinually
by the Spirit of <HI>Vncertainty,</HI> till
they fall into the Quagmire of <HI>Dispaire,</HI>
and there they are lost for ever. But
this Sceen being over, and it clearing up
again, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> on a suddain found my self in the
<PB N="35" REF="22">
place were before I left of the search, and
fancyed it to be the Town of <HI>Vanity</HI> by
the many representations that tended to
no other effect; scarcely had these thoughts
took place, but looking over my shoulder
I beheld my old Companion <HI>Discovery,</HI> and
was not a little glad I had so luckely stum|bled
on him; yet had not time to vaile
my Bonnet and pay my Respects, e're
clapping me on the Cheeks, he whispered
in a soft tone, <HI>Why have you thus unkindly
absented your self in the Dawn of my Pro|gress,
seeing there are many wonders in the
Mist of</HI> Deceit (A gloomy Region) <HI>that
are yet to be discovered by the light of Vnder|standing.</HI>
I blushed at this methought,
and would have replyed, but was hinder|ed
by the unexpected approach of a Fel|low
laden with Mutton-Taffata, and
Calves-Skin; at first I supposed him a
Knight Arrant with Shield in his Hand,
but afterwards found him a Past-board
bearer; his Pockets ratled with Gim|cracks
of divers devices, and at his Arse
hung dangling a Glew-pot, and a Pipkin
of mouldy Past, many Cording quires with
much Thread; and on the Skirt of his
Doublet stuck a hafted Bodkin, with
long Eyed Needles. Now in my Dream
I wondered who this should be, once I
<PB N="36" REF="23">
thought it might be <HI>Time,</HI> but perceiving
neither Hour-Glass nor Seith, I took him
to be an Actor in some Farce, who thus
had dressed himself in Redicule to move a
Laughter; but had not guest, long before
<HI>Discovery</HI> obliged him to make a full stop,
though e're he could be steady, he start|ed
like a Huffing Hector at the Salute of a
Serjeant. Yet recollecting himself, cryed
Sir your Business with me; whereupon I
perceived they began to Dialogue as
followeth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Discovery.</SPEAKER>
<P>My business is to find out
<HI>Honesty</HI> and <HI>Plain-dealing:</HI> Can you di|rect
me to their house Friend?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Book-b.</SPEAKER>
<P>Their house Sir, why do you
imagine then that they are House-keepers:
No no, never conceit it, for I remember
twenty Years agone they were but Lodg|ers
in our Row, and then could scarcely
pay their Chamber rent, their gettings
were so small; and would you have 'em
House-keepers in these dayes, when no
body will give 'em Porridge for their
Labour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Disc.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's hard, But <HI>Time</HI> informed
me, he once knew 'em in a flourishing condi|tion
and high esteem.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Book-b.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay he might perhaps in the
first Age of the World, but these days
<PB N="37" REF="23">
are past, and now they are held in such
contempt, that I who am but a <HI>Book-bin|der,</HI>
scorn to keep 'em Company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Disc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then it seems friend, that you can
give me no directions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Book-b.</SPEAKER>
<P>No verily not I, they were han|kering
about my door a while agone, but
my Wife lead me such a weary life, till I
had sham'd 'em off, with sham Turkey,
Sheep-skin for Calf, Scabards instead of
Past-board, Glew without sowing, and
the like, you would not think it. As for
<HI>Knavery,</HI> if you have any business with
him, he's a very thriving Gentleman that
lives hard by, and one that I have got ma|ny
a fair pound by.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Disc.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know friend as well as you how to find
the man you mention, but our business is not
with him, and so good by to you.</P>
<P>Now in my Dream I beheld we passed
this insiped thing, but had scarce turned
the Corner, before a brisk Fellow bolted
out of a dark Alley, was upon us e're we
was aware on him, and was hung round
with Quires of White and Brown, and
so covered with Parchment, you would
have took him to been in Armour; round
his Neck hung Wax and Wafers; and on
his Crown Quills brustled up in Bundles,
and in his Hands were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">onds, Indentures,
<PB N="38" REF="24">
Releases, Tickets, Warrants, and a
world of such like businesses; whilst his
Pockets strutted with Sand and Ink-Bot|tles.
This thought I must be a Scribe,
and we had past inquirey there before to
little purpose, wherefore I was for jog|ing
on; but <HI>Discovery</HI> catching me by the
little Finger, pull'd me back, and thus
made his address.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Disc.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Honesty</HI> and <HI>Plain-dealing,</HI> there's
an Estate fallen to 'em, and I am sent to
give 'em notice, that they may return and
take possession.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stat.</SPEAKER>
<P>An Estate! No no, I can't be|lieve
it, unless it be in t'other World, for
Miracles are ceased in this: But howsoe|ver
be it as it will, I can't direct you, <HI>Sta|tioners</HI>
have no business for 'em.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Disc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you not heard of him of late?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heard of them, yess, but 'tis a
pretty while a gone. I remember when I
first set up, <HI>Plain-dealing</HI> came sneaking
to my Shop in a Thread-bare Coat, and
was for roosting amongst my stacks; but,
<PB N="39" REF="24">
taking him for a Spye, I bundled him up
and sent him to the Papermill, where
they held his Nose so hard to the Grin|stone,
that they quickly obliged him to
pack up his Awls and be gone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Disc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you not heard of his Brother
the other party I mentioned, if we could find
one he would direct us to the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stat.</SPEAKER>
<P>When I lived with my Master, I
remember I heard him talk much of him,
but do not remember he ever gave him a
visit, though it seems he had been there
formerly, as one more bold than welcom,
which I gathered from his discourse, for
he often railed against him, and called
him Names for the pretended injury he
had done him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Disc.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was unkind, for I am certain
he is so just, that he would not offer the least
injury to any body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stat.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not all the particulars, but
certain I am that thus he would rate him,
though absent. A Rascal, a Villain, says
he, for hindring me from gelding the
Quires, and pretending they shrunk in
wetting if they happened to be missed, a
thousand Sheets cleverly gained in a Mor|ning
will buy a Man a good Breakfast,
when those that take his advice shall be
<PB N="40" REF="25">
obliged to keep Lent all the year. Nay,
when I over reach'd as my manner is, and
made felse Numbers do with a little Pro|testation,
this sawcy <HI>Iack</HI> would be
whispring the lye in my Ear, for which
impertinency I have often snap'd him,
says he, as if I would a bit his Head off,
and cryed, what then you Slave, can a
Trades-man live without the Faculty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Disc.</SPEAKER>
<P>This was very lately sure for he was
not used to be so served in the days of our
Forefathers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not so late Sir as you think, for
it could not be less than forty years agone,
since I heard him tell this story: Nay
further told me he was the very Eves dro|per
to Fortune, and would as times go
now make a hole in a Mans stock as in|sensibly
as the driping rain eats into the
bowels of a Flint, and bid me have a care
of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Disc.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you took the Hint I perceive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay I'll warrant you, and so has
many younger than my self. Alas Sir! I
have a Family to maintain out of hard Wax
and other Tackling, and therefore let
People talk what they will, I know what
I could write with a Pint of Ink, but won't
give my self the trouble, and so fare ye
well.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="25">
Now I perceived he had not gone far
before he slunk into his <HI>Officina</HI> like a
Snail into a Shell, and we past on to an
other quarter: And looking in at the
Mouth of an entery, beheld a Firey-faced
fellow surrounded with Glass-Bottles,
and this put me in mind it might be him,
who (as the old Wives tale has it) girt|ing
himself round with Dew Bottles, was
drawn up by the Sun into the World in
the Moon, but found my self within a
while after mistaken, for he proved to be
a Son of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> and was too much de|lighted
with his own Terce, then to make
such a perilous expedition, for a Cup of
Nectar, which notwithstanding the Man
in the Moon Drinks Claret, for ought he
knew might prove a Cup of small Beer,
when he came to tast it, yet <HI>Discovery</HI>
would enter this place, upon no other ac|count
than the <HI>German</HI> Proverb, <HI>viz. In
Vino veritas,</HI> here says he, or no where
we may stumble upon directions, but no
sooner were we entered, but our Ears
were saluted with the noise of: wellcom,
wellcom Sir. Boy, boy, show up Stairs,
and the confused tinckling of a Bell, with
the ratling of Quart Pots. I would have
been gone, as imagining our inquiry here
would be Fruitless, but <HI>Discovery</HI> over-perswaded
<PB N="42" REF="26">
me, and I stayed.</P>
<P>Now in my Dream I beheld we were
shewed into a large Room, hung round
with divers fancies, wherein the Painter
had been very exact in hitting the humour,
for here sat one a spewing, there another
bleeding with his Pate broke, this had
his Face batterd with a Quart Pot, an
other his Eye struck out with a Tobacco
Pipe, an other lay decently run through
the Lungs, on this side two at Logger-heads,
on that Bottles and Pots flying like
Hail-stones, here one tearing the Cards,
there another damming the Dice, and
shaking his empty Purse, was ready to
tear his own Flesh for madness: The
Cieling blushed with Volleys of Oaths of
a Crimson dye, that spangled it like Prim|roses,
and on the Floor lay scattred like
sedg in Meadow Ditch, bundles of horrid
imprecations. These things confirmed
my first opinion and put me out of all
hopes of intelligence in this place, but
these thoughts had scarce taken Air, when
up comes <HI>Firefacies</HI> and <HI>Discovery,</HI> as loath
to loose any time, thus entered into Dia|logue.</P>

is a lucky hit, here past doubt we may
be informed, and <HI>Discovery</HI> at the first
blush was of the same mind; wherefore
he proceeded to put the Question to her,
when turning up her Head, and stareing
<PB N="46" REF="28">
him wishfully in the Face. She demanded
what time of the Moon it was, which odd
kind of Question made him smile, as like|wise
desirous to know the reason of such a
demand. Why said she, I suppos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d you
are a little crack-braind, which once a
Moon puts you upon extravagancies, or
else you would never have undertaken
such a business. <HI>Honesty</HI> and <HI>Plain-dealing</HI>
saith she&mdash;No Friend I know them not, and
so goodby to ye.</P>
<P>She scarce had left us, when being very
inquisitive to know who she was, <HI>Disco|very</HI>
informed me she was a Dealer in hu|mane
Flesh, and that for the better colour|ing
the matter, she stiled her self a <HI>Mid-wife,</HI>
but her real business was to betray
the honour of silly Wenches to the lust of
Bully Ruffians, to supply the City Dames
with what they wanted at home, to fur|nish
business for Love, intreagues to tra|pan
young Heirs into a Wedlock noose
with her over ridden <HI>Bona Roba</HI>'s, and to
put off the effects of the Ladies great Bel|lies,
who have been tasting the forbidden
Fruit before Hand, or dispence with the
Masters familiarity with his Chamber-Maid.
Nay, said I then, 'tis no wonder
she gave you such an answer.</P>
<P>Now in my Dream I beheld that by

<P>And so we passed on till we came to a

her with mouldy Meal, and stuff of twice

to clear her Eye sight, gave her the
slip, and stept into the other quarter, and
to prevent her following, dam'd up the
passage with great lumps of Dough, pinch'd
from the good Wives Loaves, which
kept her back till I had time to raise the
Fences higher. As for the Gyant I have

<P>Now in my Dream I perceived he hast|ed

<P>Upon this he step'd into a blind Ale-house,
tip'd off his penny pot, snatch'd
his Goose out of the fire, spit upon't,
whip'd out again threaded through the
Company, and jump'd upon his shop-board,
where we left him cross-leg'd,
and suddainly turning the Corner, met
divers Married Females, who had ta|ken
leave of their Husbands under pre|tence
of visiting a sick friend, seeing their
Children at Nurse, taking their farewell
of some pretended Aunt or she Couzen,
who was Coaching it into the Country or
so; when indeed their business was no|thing
less; for looking back, we saw 'em
<PB N="58" REF="34">
dive into a Tavern, where their Gallants
attended their Arrival to entertain them
with Love possest. But we scarce had
passed them, when we stumbled upon a
drove of Painters and Journeymen Shoo-makers,
who came Reeling at a rate that
had like to overset us, but bearing up
briskly, they recoild and jostling together,
decently fell, making the Channel for
that time their Dormitorie; so taking
them for little better than Rubbish, we
left them to fill up the holes, and passed
through a little Wicket, where in my

stood in the way to hinder our Progress
through the Region of <HI>Truth,</HI> but the
Light of Understanding struck her blind
for a time, which gave us opportunity
to pass by her, which we did with as
much speed as possible, to avoid the Hiss|ing
of her feeble Snakes. Now I further
perceived that the way growing wider,
we met a grave Fellow, who resembled a

moisture; and on his Forehead was in|graven

of the same opinion, and resolved to learn
it from himself, when coming up and
clapping him on the Shoulder, he cryed
<HI>Halo Grandsir,</HI> at which rough salute he
seemed to be offended, although he could

then if they were Husbands, Wives, Ser|vants,

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flatt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, many wayes: as when I saw a
Young Lad stand discontented, I'de make
up to him, and ask him his Name, place
of Aboad, and Imployment; in which be|ing
readily satisfied, I'd raile against the
cruelty of his Father or Master, telling
him it was a shame, and that they were
punishable for using such Rigor to so
hopeful a Youth: Then would I underfeel
his resolves, by telling him of much plea|sure
and plenty, and by what means he
might possess it, or that I would help him
to a Master, whose kindness should ap|pear
<PB N="62" REF="36">
beyond expression; which wrought
upon him to that degree, that he went
contentedly, <HI>as an Ox to the Slaughter,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Disc.</SPEAKER>
<P>But met you with none that were
rough and untractable?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flatt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes many, and some came now
and then to put a trick upon me, but I
shew'd them a trick for their Learning;
for getting them to the brims of the Ele|ment,
where I had a little tipling House
for the purpose, I used to put <HI>Opium</HI> in
their Liquor, which charming their Sen|ses
into a slumber, under the favour of
that opportunity, and the dusk of the
Evening, I clapt them aboard my Badger,
and then good by Gaffer, they saw no
more daylight till they found themselves
out of their own Country, and then
though all to late, they began to Ban their
folly that had prompted them to leap out
of the Frying-pan, into the Fire.</P>

<P>But some perhaps would not swallow
this Bait?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flatt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Those I made larger offers, tel|ling
them I was indeed a Merchant, and
had whole Islands of my own, to confirm
which I had ever a voucher at my Elbow.
Then would I send them Aboard with a
fine Key a token to secure them, though
they kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">w no other then that it belong'd
<PB N="63" REF="36">
to a rich Cabbin, for so I told them, fur|nished
with all that was pleasant and de|lightful,
as also that my self would be
with them in the Evening, and accompa|ny
them in all hazards, which made them
on their arrival, begin to command like
Emperours, but their courages were soon
cool'd, for the <HI>Purser</HI> or <HI>Boatswain</HI> under
pretence of conducting them to their Cab|bin,
pulls up a Trap and thrust them head
and shoulders into dark durance, where
they found a Covey of Fools lamenting
their folly, and the Key is returned to
bait for other Wood-cocks. As for the
Married Cattle, they for the most part
Trappan one another under the coaksing
flatterys of renewed affection, having al|ways
one of us at hand, to invite the par|ty
to a splendid Entertainment near the
River, when occasionally, though it seemd
as if it happened by chance, we meet a
person who invites us Aboard, and with
many perswasions, are urged to induce a
complyance, which is no sooner done, but
they are left under the Hatches to lament
their too much Cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">dulity. As for the
Wenches, they are troled thether by such
as getting some small acquaintance, pre|tend
love and good will, feigning them|selves
to be Officers of trust and command,
<PB N="64" REF="37">
and by that means they work upon the
weakness of such Females as are Ram|pant
for Husbands; and thus have I gul|led

them, if we fear a search will be made,

<P>Now in my Dream I perceived tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
this dreadful Story put <HI>Discovery</HI> beside
<PB N="67" REF="38">
his further inquiry for not being longer
able to hear such a cruelty mentioned, he
stopped his Ears, and made hast away,
leaving this Monster of a Man, who could
not be less than a <HI>Mahometan</HI> to trudge
about his business, yet looking behind me,
I perceived him enter a strong place, made
of the Bones of Mother Earth, and forti|fied
with Iron Ribs, through which di|stressed
Mortals breath'd their Lamenta|tions,
whose sad condition whilst I was
condoling, my Ears were saluted with the
shrieks and cryes of a Female, when en|tring
the next Street called the <HI>Way of all
Fles<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> I beheld a mournful Spectacle which
sadded my Heart; and what should it be,
but the <HI>Manes</HI> of a deceased Gentleman,
whom they were carrying to his long
home, followed by a number of Mourners,
who in a manner covered their Faces, and
breath'd out many sighs to wound the Air,
and groans like Peals of Thunder: But
above all the beautyful Widdow, whom
Tears made lovely, was most outragious.
Nor as I then perceived would she be com|forted,
but still exclaimed of her hard
Fortune, to be thus deprived as she said
by cruel <HI>Death,</HI> and her ill fated Stars of
all her happiness on Earth, just in the
Spring-tide of her joys. O! said she, had

<P>This stream of grief, from one so fair
much afflicted me, and methought I
was about to step and comfort her, and
had done it, but that I beheld one very
Officious in that undertaking. By this
time we came to the Repository of the
Dead, and there she a fresh renew'd her
sorrow, and seem'd to give it scope, to
that excess, that her Friends had no small
trouble to keep her from rushing Head-long
on him in the Grave. O part us not?
said she, but let me here embrace him,
ever cling to his cold stiff Limbs, and
with my tears imbalm his senseless Clay,
preserve him from the injury of Time, and

<P>Now in r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">y Dream I perceived <HI>Discove|ry</HI>
grew weary of discoursing with this
lump of mortality, and therefore desired
him since he could give no better account
to be jogging on, when after three or four
scrapes, and twice bussing of his Hand he
left us. But as if Fortune had on purpose
<PB N="76" REF="43">
cast Blockheads in our way, we were no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
sixteen paces, before we perceived a slo|venly
Fellow come toward us, gnawing a
Custard, and this we took to be a Pastrey
Man that was wont to deal in Cat-peys,
but it proved to be <HI>Gluttony,</HI> whom it
seems went up and down from Morning
to Night, devouring all that came to his
Fingering, and so we let him pass, not
thinking it convenient to trouble our
Heads with him, as knowing him to live
upon the spoil of other Mens Tables, and
the decay of their Purses, Drunkenness
followed him in a wretched condition,
spewing and staggering all the way, twice
or thrice had he been in the Kennel, and
after him wallowed a number of fatt
Hostesses, calling to those that were be|fore
to stop him, but he still staggered
on till he came to a Prison-Gate, where
giving a great reel, he burst open the
Wicket with his Head, when his Body
following, it closed upon him, and there
I left him to bethink himself when he was
sober.</P>
<P>Now in my Dream I perceived Vertue
hasting towards us half naked, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lying
amain; for Vice with whom she had a long
time contended for the Mastry, had it
seems gotten the Victory, and was in pur|suit
<PB N="77" REF="43">
of her, she looked me thoughts lovely
and gay as the Rosie Morn, when <HI>Auro|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">a</HI>'s
Gates give way to the swift courser of
the Sun, who gilds the Eastern Clouds
with Purple and with Gold, and as she
flew towards the Clouds, I heard a voice
from the Earth cry after her, return, re|turn:
But it seems she had been so badly
used that she took no notice on't, but kept
on her way till she was out of sight.
Whereupon I began to consider with my
self, that although Vice had much inlarg|ed
his Borders, yet I could not conceive
but Vertue had many fair Territories, and
made some thousands happy with her
smiles, doing every where much good,
though her reward was for the most part
slender, which urged me to believe she
might be gone for new instructions. But
whilst these meandering imaginations
made me heavy and dumpi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">h, me thoughts
<HI>Fornication</HI> came on with a Troop of sin|ners
at his Heels, of all ages and Sexes,
whereat bless me, quoth I, am I in <HI>Sodom,</HI>
and thereupon starting I awaked, and
found it but a Dream.</P>
<P>The precedent imaginations, or won|derous
fancys making a deep impression in
my mind. I lay some time amazed at
what had past; but perceiving the Sun
<PB N="78" REF="44">
was mounted high, and in his burning
course &amp; smoat on me, rousing my self an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
rubbing hard my drowsie Eyes, after a
Yaun or two &amp; stretched my self, I got upon
my feet, when looking round me, I per|ceived
a neighbouring Grove, which at a
distance seemed so pleasant, that having
much of the day to spend, theither I bent
my steps; and entering, was delighted
with the spreading shade, which canopi|ed
me from the scorching eye of day. But
as if Fate had doom'd me to dull drousi|ness,
my Legs denyed support again, &amp; a dis|solveing
quickly slew through every part,
each Sinnew, Artery, and Ligument grew
lank; when finding I must yield, down
I cast my self on a Mossey Banck, beneath
a flowrey shade, whose sweets defused
help'd Leaden handed <HI>So<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">us</HI> Boughs,
which were of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">orce before, to make the

<P>Sleeping I Dreamed, and in my Dream
beheld my self just in the state I was be|fore,
I at last awake, and <HI>Discovery</HI> was at
my right hand, and began to chide me for
deserting him; but had not time to utter
his resentments, e're a Grave old Fellow
briskly bore upon us, wrapt up in Furrs

<P>By turning my aged Father out of

made o're to me what ever was his, and
seeing him without a sence of pitty beg
his Bread, and break his Heart with grief,
by using Artifices to prove a Whore of
her that bore me decently, to bar her of
her Dowrey, by swearing him out of his
life, who was my Faithful Friend, and
once had saved mine, because I knew that
he had layed so deep an Obligation on me
that whilst he lived I must ever have made
acknowledgements, and therefore at one
bold stroak I rid my self of such an ill
conveniency, and if from these you gather
that either <HI>Honesty, Plain-dealing,</HI> or the

me after him, leaving this piece of inhu|manity
to travel to the Regions of <HI>De|struction,</HI>
and had not gone far, but a

often stumbled as I perceived, because his

ever in a dancing motion, touching but
lightly the detested soil. As for his gaudy

every other Trade, that usually contri|butes
to promote our ages vanity. In his
face sat <HI>Youth</HI> and <HI>Age,</HI> his countenance
was feminine, though I perceived him to
partake of either Sex, his Pockets struted
with Perriwigs Powders, Patches, Paints,
Washes, Pomades, and a thousand such
impertinencies; his Eyes were upward,
and therefore he stumbled upon us before
he was awar, when <HI>Pride</HI> (for so was his
Name) somewhat declining from his stif|fer
State, he cast a disdainful look, and
asked us in a haughty manner, how we
durst oppose his way, but little minding

<P>Ay Sir, I know you have confidence

Nay you are the eldest born of <HI>Satan,</HI> that

<P>In my Dream I perceived this Tart dis|course
so thorrowly netled <HI>Pride,</HI> that
swelling with indignation till he well
nigh burst, he was about to revenge the
affront as he termed it, but <HI>Discovery</HI> cast
the mist of <HI>Self-conceit</HI> before his Eyes,
which so dozed his little understanding,
that before he could find his senses, we
were out of reach. But Fate soon crost us
by casting ambi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ion in our way, a thing
that walks on Piramides, whom we found
to be more turbulent than the former, for
his discourse was of nothing but aspiring
greatness, Blood and Reve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ge, grasping
at Crowns, Scepters, and such like in|signes
of Royalty: Though as I perceived
he was made up of nothing but <HI>Airy ima|ginations,</HI>
corded together with <HI>insatiable

desire</HI> and <HI>thirst of Glory,</HI> but so loosly that
they often slipt, and indangered his fall|ing
in pieces, and therefore not finding
a solid substance, we let him pass, when
close at his Heels followed Ruine and
Disgrace: Being almost out of hopes of
finding any Person of whom we might in|quire,
we left this Street, and struck off
into Humility-Lane, where we had yet
some hopes of retriving our lost labour,
but found our selves deceived, for Pride
and Ambition it seems had been there and
taken Hostages of the Inhabitants to be
at their devotion, which did not a little
trouble me, for I had flattered my self,
that here our search might end; but
whilst I was musing on many things, up
comes a Fellow whom I afterward under|stood
to be <HI>Self-conceit,</HI> and it seems he had
been a great Romancer, and understood
something of <HI>Logick,</HI> he appeared very
Airy, and was as brisk as <HI>Bottled Ale;</HI>
thought I to my self this is a <HI>Rambler,</HI> and
may perhaps inform us of more then we

for the propagation of this so much

perfected at the Theorick, he brings
them to the Practick, for hanging a pair
of Breeches upon a Line fastned cross the

the Pocket, and the young Fry command|ed
to take what they find in the Latter,
without so much as Tinkling the Former,

Tobacco dust into their Eys, instead
of pretending to snuff it themselves; or
sprinkling with a little small Brush a little
scattering of Aquafortis upon that part
of your Hand or Wrist that appears
bare, if any do, and for defect of that,
upon your Neck or Face, nay sometimes
in your Shoos, or as opportunity gives
occasion; which burning or smarting,
puts the party into suddain confusion,

seldom it is, but we go two together, by

then the <HI>Budg</HI> by jostling or some other
affront, creates a Quarrel, gathers a
Croud, and oft is beaten to some purpose,
to give his Comrade opportunity to Dive
or nip the Bung; which latter is to cut the

till the <HI>File</HI> has opportunity to do his
business and File off; nay in a narrow
place, but especially in the dark, the
<HI>Budg</HI> will tumble down before you, and
with miserable crys implore your Aide,
protesting he has broke a Leg or Arm, and
whilst you in compassion give him your
assistance towards rearing him an end,
himself will give you the flam for all your
Guilt, and then his Leg or Arm's as sound
as any Roach, for strait away he trudges
to the next Coverture. These and a Cat|talogue

<P>But are they not often Intercepted in

<P>Ay, and often lay'd up in the

but we have as many shapes as
<HI>Proteous,</HI> to prevent our being known a|gain,

<P>Now in my Dream I perceived he gave
the nimble Trip to the next Road, call'd
the <HI>way of Durance,</HI> where being hotly
persued, he was run down in the <HI>Fast|nesses</HI>
of <HI>Stony-stay-him-there,</HI> and thence
taken, sometime after was put Aboard an
Upland Frigget, which wanting a Rud|der,
drove violently upon the Rock call'd

<L>The ways of Sin are ever dangerous found,</L>

<L>Although the Sinners way at first seems

<L>Yet Death and danger in the end he'l meet.</L>
<P>Thus far having Ransacked many

Footed Animals, exposed to Sail where
men of every Shire assembled, to expose
<PB N="138" REF="74">
or purchase, here thought I, we may be
satisfied how matters go in every part.
But <HI>Discovery</HI> perceiving I was big with
such imaginations, singles me out a man
that should as to the present business give
me the sence ef the rest; and who should
this be, but <HI>Mounsier le Iockey,</HI> a big set

<P>If I thought you had any dealing
with them, i'de deny you your request for

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Disc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, waveing that, I hope you'l
be complyant, it may much advantage us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Iock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, it may so, therefore
give attention.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Disc.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall, and think my self Obliged
for the Narration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Iock.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may perhaps be longer then my
business may permit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Disc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Therefore be as concise as you can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Iock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall. As first, he that pre|tends
to a <HI>Iockey ship,</HI> must be well stock|ed
with Impudence, and Oaths, or he
can never arrive at the hight of that bu|siness.
He must in the next place be fur|nished
with false Mains, false Tales, false
Ears, and false Eys, if such be required to
Beautifie an old defective or diseased
Horse, or to disguise one that is stolen, or
has been often blown upon; he must like|wise
be skilled at making Artificial Snips
stars and Blases, for the reason before
<PB N="140" REF="75">
said; he must have Saddles with Sharp-wires
in them, which as he presses for|ward,
passing through divers holes for
that purpose, may prick the Horse, and
make him dance or caper, as if it proceed|ed
from his mettlesome Temper. Then
must he be dexterous at Logging a Foun|dered
Hose with Lead, and by slitting
the flank and pits of the Eyes, blow them
up with a Quill as Butchers do Veal, to
hide the defects of Age or bad keeping;
he must likewise use to baffet a Blind
Horse, whose blindness is not presently
discernable; as likewise to blow Ginger
and Pepper into his Eys, that when he
comes to swear him sure Sighted, he may
with the least wind of his hand, hat, or
noise of his switch, vantle and toss up his
Head, as if he was as sharp sighted as
<HI>Argus.</HI> He must have Balls of Dough,
Eggs, Malmsey and Lickerish together,
with Oats boyled in new Wort, to make
a Horse that is doomed to the Dogs, ap|pear
Fat on a suddain, though it being
but spungy, will lose faster then it is got|ten,
which makes many foolishly imagine
such Horses to be bewitched, when it is
only the Knavery of the <HI>Iockey.</HI> He must
likewise have the art of pricking a dull
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> in the Spurting place, and rub bea|ten
<PB N="141" REF="75">
Glass into the Holes, to make the
Horses winch upon the least touch, that
it may be thought to proceed from his
mettlesome Temper. He must have the
art of taking up the Fetlock vein with a
Needle and a piece of Silk, so to Lame
his Neighbours Horse, that the cure
being dispaired of, he may purchase him
at an easie rate; as likewise to have a
large stone ready to thrust into the Fun|dament
of any Horse he likes, to make
him seem by the trimbling and sweating
posture it will put him into, that he is
just a dying; nor can the Farrier in this
cause tell what to do to him, unless he
knew the cause of his Grief. These and
a thousand other Dexterities calculated ac|cording
to the <HI>Meridian of Knavery,</HI> are
Ingredients that must goe to the making
of a perfect <HI>Iockey;</HI> but for this time let
this suffice, because I see a Chapman
striking my Voucher luck, I must be gone
and manage him, least he fly off, and re|cant
his bargain. Therefore if you seek
for <HI>Honesty</HI> and <HI>Plail-dealing</HI> Friend, you
must inquire some where else, for here's
no room for them in these parts.</P>
<P>Now I perceived in my Dream, that at
the racital of so much Knavery, <HI>Discovery</HI>
shook his head, and made no answer, but
<PB N="142" REF="76">
left this place as dispairing to be further|ed
in his search, in the very Tents of
Wickedness, and so we passed into <HI>Mer|cyless
street,</HI> where we met a Fellow with
sharp Teeth, and long Paws, Monkey
Eyed, and Hawk Nosed, with the spoils
of a Crab-Tree in his Hand, and this I
understood to be a <HI>Catch-pole,</HI> the very
Catterpiller of the Nation; and although
we knew we should not better our selves
by his communication, yet perceiving mis|chief
in his Face, methought we were
somewhat desirous of discoursing him, if
but to divert him from evil purposes; and
therefore <HI>Discovery</HI> put the usual Questi|on,
when at the name of <HI>Honesty</HI> and
<HI>Plain-dealing,</HI> he gave a Leap, which
canted him quite cross the way, crying
out, <HI>I defie ye, I defie ye.</HI> Which at first
made me imagine he took us for fallen
Angels, but after many intreats, we
brought him to a little more moderation&punc;
when I fancyed in my Dream, that thus
the talk went on.</P>

This he joyfully consents to, without de|fesance

of the World is come;</HI> wherefore he admo|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">ed,
<HI>All Men every where to Repent, and
<PB N="149" REF="79">

Secret should be hid, and therefore advis|ed
them <HI>to walk Honestly, &amp;c.</HI> And that
leading him to an exceeding high place,
he had given him a prospect of Eternity,
Judgement, and many glorious things.
But hefore he had time to mention the
particulars, we were arrived at a fair Vil|lage,
called the Village of <HI>Self-deceiving,</HI>
yet he had so much time as to tell me the
mans Name was <HI>Evangelist</HI> e're we En|tered
it.</P>
<P>Now in my Dream I perceived this Vil|lage,
though but a Village in name, might
have passed for a populous City, it being
every where pestered with thro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ghing
Crouds of all Nations; and here it was
that we rosolved to prosecu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e our inqui|ry,
but found the inhabitants so self-con|ceited,
that we began to dispair of gain|ing
instructions, for every where I per|ceived,
they were for <HI>putting far away the
Evil day,</HI> and flattered themselves, that if
in the <HI>December</HI> of their Age they cast off
<HI>Vice,</HI> and open their Arms to <HI>Virtue,</HI> she
would then infallibly conduct them to the
<HI>Celestial City,</HI> for theither I perceived
they hopped to arrive in the end, though
they went the contrary Road, and put off
<PB N="150" REF="80">
all inquiry, as to their being right <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
wrong, till they came to the end of thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ace; though as I understood, ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
were Inns and Stages where Guides resid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">|ed,
on purpose to direct Travellers, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
although they offered their Service with|out
Reward, yet would it not be accept|ed,
because these Guides would not suffer
them to cast their Eys upon the Gaudy
Vanities, <HI>Flattery</HI> and <HI>Delusion</HI> had cast
in the way, nor to harbour wandering
thoughts, and lustful imaginations, which
as I perceived, were their Darling Com|panions,
and if they were check'd for en|tertaining
them, they would presently be
Angry, and cry out, <HI>what a doo do you
make, the way is exceeding long, and would
be tiresome without these our dear Compani|ons,
whom we intend to leave when we come
near the</HI> Celestial Gate; <HI>Ay, shake them
off, e're we come into the presence of the
Lord of that City.</HI> And thus I understood
they put it off from time to time, till in
the end there was no time longer, or at
least so little, that <HI>Grace</HI> having left 'em,
they had not the power to shake off their
worly Companions, who had Accompani|ed
them in the whole course of their
Lives, but they would along with them
into the Regions of <HI>Eternity,</HI> whether
<PB N="151" REF="80">
they would or no; and there <HI>Iudgement</HI>
finding them wandering in an infinite la|brinth
of unmesurable spaces, (for into
the <HI>Celestial City</HI> they were not suffered
to enter) he plundged them into everlast|ing
Confusion, <HI>appointing them their Porti|on
with Hippocrites and Vnbelievers,</HI> to be|wail
their past folly, to Ages without
number, considering too late, that it had
been better for them to have taken the
Council of the Wise-man, <HI>viz. Remem|ber
thy Creator, in the days of thy Youth, &amp;c.</HI>
Then by giving themselves up to <HI>Cove|tousness,
Extortion, Fraud, Oppression,</HI> and
the like, to gain a plentiful Estate for
those that should come after them, who
perhaps by the in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">oyment, were over|whelmed
in <HI>Pride, Luxurie, Vncleanness,
Drunkenness,</HI> and the like, to the hazard
of their Salvation or a Death-bed Re|pentance,
which is seldome sinceir; and
wonderfully questionable whether accep|table
when the party is brought to a peri|od,
and in no longer a Capacity of Sin|ning.
These considerations made me sad,
and I verely perswaded my self, did men
but rightly understand the Excellency of
<HI>Virtue,</HI> or were not willfully blind to the
ugliness of <HI>Vice,</HI> this world would prove as
happy a Paradice to us, as <HI>Eden</HI> did to our
<PB N="152" REF="81">
first Parents in their state of innocence.
But whilst these things carryed me away,
perceived in my Dream, that <HI>Discovery</HI>
was making observations on many antick
figures, and Monuments with inscripti|ons,
which represented in Hirogliphics,
<HI>Vprightness, Truth, Honesty, Conversati|on,</HI>
and the like, to which some of the
inhabitants had great regard; but for the
Major part, I perceived they minded none
of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">, except one richly Guilded. <HI>Sta|tue</HI>
inscribed <HI>Self-ends,</HI> and to him they
payed their dayly offerings, because as I
understood, they imagined he chiefly pro|moted
their intrest in Worldly matters;
here we found likewise the foot-steps of
<HI>Plain-dealing,</HI> which we traced till we
quite lost sight of the Village of <HI>Self-de|ceiving,</HI>
and arrived at the Foot of a high
Mountain, called, <HI>Fond-Imagination,</HI> on
which stood the Town of <HI>Vain-hope,</HI> and
up this Mountain, divers Persons were
Clambering, with might and main, some
made such hast, that not taking good
Footing, when near the Top, they tum|bled
down again unto the Valley, where
falling into the Torrent of <HI>Distrust,</HI> they
were violently hurried into the Lake of
<HI>Dispair,</HI> and there for ever lost.</P>
<P>Now in my Dream, I perceived a Per|son,
<PB N="153" REF="81">
whom I conceited I had formerly
known, puffing and sweating to gain the
Ascent, which I hinting to <HI>Discovery,</HI> he
told me, if I would give him the hearing,
he would enter into a discourse with him.
Ay, gladly said I, and thereupon we soon
over took him, whose Name was <HI>Indiffer|ency,</HI>
and thus I perceived they began.</P>

<P>Now in my Dream, I perceived we
Arrived at the Town of <HI>Vain-hope,</HI> where
we fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nd a great number of People <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
as if they were in the greatest
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> imaginable, every one being
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> of his own opinion, to which they
<PB N="157" REF="83">
were wretchedly Wedded, by <HI>Error, Flat|tery,</HI>
and <HI>Delusion,</HI> to whom they gave
the greatest Credit imaginable, and the
rather because they deceived them with
false Glasses, called the Glasses of <HI>Vain|hope,</HI>
which gave them a prospect of
Heaven and Earth at once, promising
them all the pleasures and delights of this
World, and a full fruition of the next,
which made them chose the broad way,
that was spread with Roses, and over|shaded
with Gessamie, the way that leads to
the Land of <HI>Perdition,</HI> and refuseth the
<HI>Thorney way of Life</HI> as too tedious and
troublesome; when as they fondly ima|gined
they lead to one and the same place,
and so they supinely trifled out their days
in a secure sloath and ease. Till in my
Dream I beheld a dark Cloud arrising
from the Land of <HI>Obstinacy,</HI> overspread
them, whereupon they layed them down
to sleep, whilst the Bride-groom passed
by; but being a little startled at the
noise, they got up on their Feet, and at|tempted
to follow, but being still in a
thick Fog, they stumbled at every three
or four steps, and in the end, fell alto|gether
in the Lake of Fear and Amaz|ment,
where they again found those
Consciences they had stifled, which now
<PB N="158" REF="84">
upbraided them with their neglect and
folly, their slighting the Golden op|portunities
of Grace, Wisdorn, for
trifling Vanities, spending those pre|tious
moments wherein they should
have trod the paths of Righteousness,
at the end of which is Eternal Life,
in studying to overeach their Neigh|bours
Circumvent, their dearest Friends,
meditate revenge, and hoard up ill
gotten gain, which cannot avail in
the day of Death, nor the hour of
Judgement; which Repremands, and
severe Reflections, tormented them to
that degree, that instead of looking
back for succor, they rushed forward
altogether, and getting out of that
Lake, entred another call'd <HI>Hardness of
Heart,</HI> in which they wilfully peri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">h|ed.
At which whilst I was grieving,
I beheld at a little distance, the Town
of <HI>Presumption,</HI> to which we made with
all conveniant speed, and upon our
entering, observed the structures were
exceeding losty, but built upon such
Sandy foundations, that they were
threatned by every blast of Fate, to
be sunk in their own ruines. This
place <HI>Self-conceit</HI> had built. As for
the Inhabitants, they were so Wed|ded
<PB N="159" REF="84">
to their own oppinions, that they
would hearken to no instructions, yet
they pretended to a right in the <HI>Celestial
City,</HI> and would discourse as if they were
very well acquainted with it. But I soon
perceived all was but conceit, they had
it seems Dreamed something on, and
read the promises made by the <HI>Celestial
King,</HI> but were so confident in their
own strength, that they imagined they
had no need of over-shaddowing Grace,
and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">reat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ing of the favorit of Hea|ven,
which made them neglect to cast
away every weighty sin: That did so
easily beset them, that they might be
the abler to run the race. Wherefore
having s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ent their days allowed, to runin
a fond relyance upon their own foundati|ons;
when the Storm of Tryal beat
upon them, they altogether sunk into
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">uine and confusion, the noise of whose
fall Eccho'd to the Remotest part of the
Universe. And now methought the day
being spent, and our search! heitherto
fruitless; <HI>Discovery</HI> being tired, and
loath to wast his Light any further at
this time in vain, bid me Adue, and tak|ing
Wing, Glided like a Metor through
the Gloomy Night, till my Eys could fol|low
him no further; but whilst I was
<PB N="160" REF="85">
wondering to what Region he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ed,
methought I heard a voice as the voice of
a man, sayingin, <HI>He that Reads, and
rightly considers these things, will be a
Friend to</HI> Virtue, <HI>and a Foe to</HI> Vice. At
which starting, I awoke, and found what
had passed was but a Dream, yet was con|firmed
it might not be a little useful and
advantagious to Mankind.</P>
