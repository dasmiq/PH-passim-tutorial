A number that no man could number, that had
passed through the Great Tribulation, and washed their Gar|ments,

Therefore are they before the Throne of God, and serve him
day and night in his Holy Temple; and he that sitteth on the

away all Tears of Sorrow from their Eyes for ever.</P>

And this is your <HI>Portion,</HI> you <HI>Dear Children of the

<P>Here is first a passing <HI>Through the Great Tribulation,</HI>
and to be made of the <HI>Number of the Slain of the Lord;</HI>
and being truly Humbled into his Blessed Will, in the

the Lord,</HI></HI> until he <HI>Create you to a lively Hope,</HI> and give you

<P>And now this <HI>Love of God constrains you to walk</HI> in all
<HI>Strict Observations</HI> that are <HI>Required</HI> of you to be done;
but no more to <HI>Lean</HI> upon them for <HI>Life,</HI> but have now
all your <HI>Obediences</HI> accepted of God through <HI>Faith</HI> in
the <HI>Light, Life,</HI> and <HI>Name</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> in whom you now
<PB N="5" REF="4">

<P>Oh you ever Blessed and Happy People! Who doth
<HI>Witness Fulfilled</HI> in you what is here <HI>Written; Lift</HI> up
your <HI>Heads</HI> and <HI>Rejoyce</HI> in the Lord, and in the <HI>Almighty
Power</HI> of his <HI>Humble, Meek</HI> and Pure Spirit, which makes
<HI>Self</HI> of no <HI>Reputation,</HI> but through your <HI>Obedience</HI> to
Christ Jesus the <HI>True Light,</HI> in whom you come to

the <HI>Tender</HI> and <HI>Tribulated</HI> ones; and in what possible

come into the <HI>Heavenly Vnity</HI> with the <HI>Father</HI> in the <HI>Son;</HI>

to Christ in his Suffering and Death,</HI> that in the <HI>Hea|venly

may Sing <HI>Halelujah,</HI> and High Praises to the Lord their
God, over all the wrath that's in the Children of men;
which <HI>will come to an end, and vanish away like Smoak,</HI>
before you whom the Lord hath called in meekness and

<P>ANd further, I have this to communicate to my
<HI>Friends</HI> and <HI>Brethren;</HI> that what hath come to pass
these late years, for want of <HI>Watchfulness</HI> to be <HI>Guided</HI>
by the Spirit of the Lord: <HI>Love hath been quenched in many,
that Offences hath entred,</HI> and Separation followed; which
hath <HI>Deeply</HI> wounded my Spirit, who have endeavoured
to the utmost of my <HI>Power</HI> in the <HI>Love of God</HI> to <HI>prevent</HI>
such <HI>Proceedings;</HI> and so have I done in many years past,
in <HI>preventing</HI> Papers ready to be <HI>Printed</HI> from being <HI>Pub|lished,</HI>
that were of a tendency to quench the Love of one
towards another: And when <HI>Ieffery Bullocks</HI> Papers were
published in Print, which would appear to the Reader of
a tendancy as to the <HI>Breach of Vnity;</HI> (which would cause
the <HI>Enemies</HI> of God to <HI>Rejoyce,</HI> it did so wound my
Spirit, that for <HI>many Weeks,</HI> they that <HI>saw</HI> me did not
<HI>expect</HI> that I would <HI>continue long</HI> in the Body: But God
in his <HI>Mercy</HI> Restored <HI>Strength</HI> in his <HI>Appointed</HI> time.</P>
<P>And when I did hear that some in the <HI>West,</HI> did intend
to <HI>Publish in Print</HI> some Friends Weaknesses: I <HI>Bore</HI> my
<HI>Testimony</HI> against such <HI>Proceedings,</HI> and told <HI>one that did
Favour what was intended, <HI>That I would have my
Hand Cut off, before I would Exercise it in such
Undertakings</HI> (as the state of Friends was at that time.)</HI>
And desired him, <HI>To speak to</HI> W. R. <HI>that he would
not proceed in Publishing any thing of that Na|ture;
for if he did, it would be a prejudice to Truth,
and would produce very sad Consequences that
would follow, and my Spirit would be deeply
wounded, as it is this day, through these Proceed|ings;
that voluntarily through want of Love, casts
away the Iudgment, that is given to the people of
<PB N="8" REF="6">
the Saints of the most High God (to keep all sweet
and savoury amongst us) into the Hands of the Ene|mies
of God, as an inlet for them to come into
the midst of us, to sit as Iudges and trample up|on
us.</HI></P>
<P>So to <HI>Clear</HI> my <HI>Conscience</HI> of all <HI>False Reports Cast</HI> upon
me, as that I have <HI>Encouraged</HI> what is <HI>Brought forth</HI> as
before written; and to <HI>Satisfie all Friends</HI> in God, I have
<HI>Laboured</HI> according to the <HI>Ability</HI> God hath given me,
to <HI>Prevent</HI> the <HI>Publishing</HI> all things of that <HI>Nature,</HI> as afor|said;
and have <HI>Endeavoured</HI> with all <HI>concerned,</HI> that I
could meet with: to have a care of <HI>watching for Evil,</HI> lest
they <HI>Provoke</HI> one another to <HI>Wrath,</HI> and so <HI>Quench</HI> the
<HI>Love:</HI> But rather <HI>Look</HI> at the <HI>Good</HI> one in another, and in
the <HI>Love</HI> of God, Minister, to <HI>Preserve</HI> them forth of any
<HI>Weakness</HI> they did see lay <HI>near</HI> to attend them; that so
the <HI>Pure Holy Spirit of Light, Life</HI> and <HI>Love,</HI> that first
<HI>Gathered</HI> us into it self, to be a <HI>People in God,</HI> and in his
<HI>Blessed</HI> Authority to <HI>reign over</HI> what was, and is contra|ry
to his <HI>Blessed Nature,</HI> may again <HI>Restore,</HI> (where it is
wanting) in the <HI>Vniversality</HI> of its <HI>Blessed Power,</HI> to make
up the <HI>Breaches,</HI> and to <HI>Restore</HI> the <HI>Desolate ones,</HI> in cau|sing
every one that <HI>Professeth</HI> the <HI>Biessed Truth of God,

as they would have others to do unto them;</HI> that so all <HI>con|cerned</HI>
in the <HI>Exercise,</HI> in the <HI>Measure</HI> of the <HI>Grace of
