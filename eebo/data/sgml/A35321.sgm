<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<L>YOu must to day your Appetite prepare</L>
<L>For a plain English Treat of homely Fare:</L>
<L>We neither <HI>Bisque,</HI> nor <HI>Olli&agrave;s</HI> shall advance</L>
<L>From Spanish Novel, or from French Romance;</L>
<L>Nor shall we charm your Ears, or feast your Eyes</L>
<L>With Turkey-Works, or Indian Rarityes:</L>
<L>But to plain <HI>Hollinshead</HI> and down-right <HI>Stow</HI></L>
<L>We the coarse Web of our Contrivance owe.</L>
<L>Since Laces, Ribbands, and such Modish geer</L>
<L>Fetcht from abroad are now forbidden here,</L>
<L>Amongst those Forreign Toys (for ought we know)</L>
<L>Fine Plots for Plays may be included too.</L>
<L><HI>Greece,</HI> the first Mistress of the Tragick Muse,</L>
<L>To grace her Stage, did her own Heroes chuse;</L>
<L>Their Pens adorn'd their Native Swords; and thus</L>
<L>What was not <HI>Grecian</HI> past for Barbarous.</L>
<L>On us our Country the same duty lays,</L>
<L>And English Wit should English Valour raise.</L>
<L>Why should our Land to any Land submit</L>
<L>In choice of Heroes, or in height of Wit?</L>
<L>This made him write, who never writ till now,</L>
<L>Only to shew what better Pens should do.</L>
<L>And for his Pains he hopes he shall be thought</L>
<L>(Though a bad Poet,) a good Patriot.</L>

<L>THe World must now confess, that Monarchs are</L>
<L>Of him, who rules above, the cheifest care:</L>
<L>For <HI>Richmond,</HI> whom in vain so long I sought,</L>
<L>Whom I with half my Realm had gladly bought,</L>

<L>Heaven could not give me, nor I covet more!</L>
<L>Fond Boy! what madness with such fatal speed</L>
<L>Under my Justice hastens thee to bleed?</L>
<L>I owe thy Frenzy to my kinder Stars,</L>
<L>Who thus conclude my dangers, and my wars.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Lovel.</SPEAKER>
<L>The Powers above are now ambitious grown</L>
<L>To bribe your Favour, and preserve your Throne;</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="4">
They give you <HI>Richmond;</HI> and in giving him</L>
<L>They from the power of chance your Crown redeem:</L>
<L>Should the world joyn this Kingdom to devour,</L>
<L>It would not weaken, but declare your power.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Catesby.</SPEAKER>
<L>Tumultuous, and Unarm'd their Forces are,</L>
<L>And fit to make a riot, not a war:</L>
<L>The Crown tempts <HI>Richmond,</HI> like a silly Fly,</L>
<L>Which dazled with the flame does in it dy.</L>
<L>As Justice here below, so Heaven does blind</L>
<L>Their eyes, whose execution is design'd.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<L>I both his rashness and his weakness know;</L>
<L>But those, who now are weak, may stronger grow;</L>
<L>I therefore have such preparations made,</L>
<L>As form an Army fitter to invade</L>
<L>Whole Kingdoms, then to quell a giddy Rout</L>
<L>Of half-starv'd Fugitives, newly thrust out</L>
<L>From Forreign Lands: Poor Worms! they shall not long</L>
<L>Attend their Fate. Treason though ne're so young,</L>
<L>And weak, should not be dally'd with, but must,</L>
<L>When first it buds, and in the shell be crush't.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ratclife.</SPEAKER>
<L>Great Sir, these Fugitives will soon afford</L>
<L>More bus'ness for your Heads-man, then your Sword:</L>
<L>But 'tis not now their number, nor their armes,</L>
<L>That they confide in; they have other charms,</L>
<L>Which draw into their Circle, and bewitch</L>
<L>All those, whom either discontent, or Itch</L>
<L>Of novelty makes apt to be undone;</L>
<L>The Lady <HI>El'sabeth's</HI> weak right they own</L>
<L>To ground their Treason on: they boldly frame</L>
<L>All Orders, Warrants, Summons in her Name.</L>
<L>And thus the easie <HI>Welch</HI> (a Nation soon</L>
<L>Stirr'd up, and then again as soon laid down)</L>
<L>Caught with this Quail-pipe to their Camp resort,</L>
<L>And with Provisions the lean Troops support.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Catesby.</SPEAKER>
<L>Young <HI>Richmond</HI> does himself her Champion own,</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<L>You now may shew it, <HI>Stanly</HI> in defence</L>
<L>Of your best Friend; For <HI>Richmond</HI> with pretence</L>
<L>Of right as weak, as his starv'd Forces are,</L>
<L>Invades the Land; whom nothing but despair,</L>
<L>Or hunger could have thrust on this design,</L>
<L>Unless some Traitors here should with him joyn.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Stanly.</SPEAKER>
<L>Poor Mushrom! His short date of Life is out,</L>
<L>Since all his hopes are in the fickle Rout;</L>
<L>Whose Favour is more various, then the Winds,</L>
<L>Whose Fortunes are more desp'rate, then their Minds.</L>
<L>But when your conqu'ring Army comes in sight,</L>
<L>You'l find them fit for slaughter, not for fight.</L>
<L>Of this a signal proof now brought me hither;</L>
<L>For having notice there was drawn together</L>
<L>A numerous body of the Borderers</L>
<L>'Twixt <HI>Cheshire,</HI> and <HI>North-Wales;</HI> urg'd by my fears,</L>
<L>Lest, unsupprest at first, this little Flame</L>
<L>Grown wider might become too fierce to tame,</L>
<L>I strait did hasten to their Rendezvous;</L>
<L>And, lest I should the fair advantage lose,</L>
<L>I did not for your Royal Order wait:</L>
<L>And, Sir, the issue was proportionate</L>
<L>Both to my Zeal, and Justice of your cause:</L>
<L>For now our Swords have left them to your Laws.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<L>My Lord, this service to the full does shew</L>
<L>How much a King may to his Subject owe:</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="5">
For <HI>Richmond</HI> these, and these had <HI>Richmond</HI> prop't,</L>
<L>Had not your Hand this budding Treason crop't.</L>
<L>And now, my Lord, I hope, your Forces are</L>
<L>Advancing hither; For I ill can spare</L>
<L>About my Person, and within my call</L>
<L>Such Troops, as yours, and such a General.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Stanly.</SPEAKER>
<L>You are my Sov'raign (Sir) a double way;</L>
<L>Your Wisdom, and your Power bear equal sway:</L>
<L>But, Sir, I fear th' effect, if we should joyn,</L>
<L>And all our Strength within one Camp confine.</L>
<L>You know, the Power by the Invader brought</L>
<L>(Compar'd to yours) will scarce deserve your thought,</L>
<L>Much less your Fear: He all his hopes does place</L>
<L>Upon the Risings of the Populace,</L>
<L>And thinks, his Snow-ball rowling to, and fro,</L>
<L>Though slender yet, to Bulk and Weight may grow:</L>
<L>If this be true, judge how important then</L>
<L>Divided Bodies are of chosen Men,</L>
<L>Who by their several motions may prevent</L>
<L>Risings, and Succours to the Rebels sent.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<L>So let it be: I must confess, my Lord,</L>
<L>Your reasons are convincing, as your Sword.</L>
<L>Honour's your Mistress; and I clearly see,</L>
<L>You mean to rob me of the Victorie,</L>
<L>And make her wholly yours.</L>

<SP>

<L>Sir, I design</L>
<L>The Glory to be yours, the Hazard mine.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<L>Hazard, and Glory are so linkt together,</L>
<L>That without both I can pretend to neither,</L>
<L>But how does your indulgent Lady bear</L>
<L>This rash Invasion of her Son? I fear,</L>
