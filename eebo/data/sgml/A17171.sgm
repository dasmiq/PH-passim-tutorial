<P>_WHa~ our Lord Iesus Christ in the r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">r. of Mathewe, was spoken to in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ertayne poyntes concernynge wedlocke, he hadde a respecte behynde hym in to the olde Testament, &amp; gaue answere
<PB REF="20">
oute of Moses, that he sayd, howe that wedlocke at the beginynge was ordyned of God himselfe. For as muche therfore as I nowe also am myn ded to speake of the begynnynge and fyrst origi|nall of holy wedlocke, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">owe no better, tha~ in lyke manner to stablysh the same out of y^e ryght excelle~t Prophet of God Moses, who writeth &amp; testifieth in the seco~d Chapter of his fyrst boke, y^t God made the ma~ Ada~ altogyther perfect, set h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> in the Paradise or garden of pleasure, and after ward sayd immediately: It is not good that ma~ should be alone. I wyll make hym a fellowe hel|per to stand nexte by hym. For whan the Lorde <NOTE PLACE="marg">The p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ate Gen. ii. Playnelye <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ed</NOTE> had shapen man oute of the earth, he brought vn to hym all maner of beastes, that he myght giue euery one his right name, howe it should be cal|led, &amp; that he might looke vpon the~. But among the~ al found he none apte to be ioyned vnto him selfe, none that he could set his harte vpon, none lyke hym selfe, none that he myghte dwell by as by an helper and conforter. And vpon this sayd God: It is not good, that man should be alone. And therfore determined he withe hym selfe, to make an helpe and conforte vnto man. In the whiche processe we perceaue alreadye, where ho|ly <NOTE PLACE="marg">Wed locke was institu|ted of God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">aradyse.</NOTE> wedlocke was instituted, namely in the Pa|radise and garden of pleasure: yea and whan it was ordined, euen in the begynnyng of y^e world
<PB N="ii" REF="20">
before the fall of ma~ in all prosperite. Of whom also it was instituted euen of no Aungel or ma~ but of God hymselfe, doubtles to mannes great conforte and healpe. For in as much as god him selfe sayth: It is not good for man to be alone: It followeth, that it is good for man to haue his owne lawfull mate. As for that cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">l which some tyme is sene and sound among maried parsons, it commeth not chefely of holy wedlocke, but of the misusyng therof, and because men do not as God commaundeth and as they shulde do.</P>
<P>Nowe wyll we farther consyther, howe God dyd institute holy wedlocke, &amp; he hymselfe made a companion for man, and brought him a wife. It followe the thus in Moses: Then the Lorde God cast a slomber on Ada~, and he slepte. And <NOTE PLACE="marg">The creaci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> of the wom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"></NOTE> he toke out one of his rybbes, and in stede therof hefylle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> vp the place wyth flesh: And thus oydde God make the woman, out of the rybbe that he had taken from Adam. Of this maner dyd god make for man a companion, lyke vnto hymselfe, and mete for hym. Here nowe ought we to consi der the occasion, why GOD made the woman out of the slepynge man, and not whyle he was awake. Of the rybbe, &amp; not as well of the earthe, as he had made the man to fore. For all this ser ueth to the declaracion of our purpose.</P>
<P>Fyrst in the slepe of Adam, dyd he set forthe y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">
<PB REF="21">
death of Christ, out of the which (vnto the same Lorde Christ) there is prepared a pure and holy spouse in the Fountayne of water thorowe the worde, as Paule sayth to the Ephesians y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> fyfte Chapter Of suche health and grace of GOD should marryed folkes also haue vndersta~dynge and knowledge. Moreouer his mynde is to sig|nifye vnto vs that in takyng holy wedlocke in hand, all te~tacions should slepe. The ordinau~ce regard, and feare of God, ought to ioyne them togither, that are disposed to marry. The wo|man was taken from and out of the syde of ma~ and not from the earthe, least ony man shoulde thyncke that he had gotten his wyfe oute of the myer: but to considre, that the wife is y^e husbon|des flesh and bone, and therfore to loue her. yet was she not made of the head. For the husbond is the head and master of the wyfe. Nether was she made of the feete (as thoughe thou mighteste spurne her away fro~ the, &amp; nothyng regard her) but euen out of thy syde, as one that is set next vnto man, to be his helpe &amp; companion. And as the bone of the flesh is strong, so ought the hus|band to be the strengthe, healpe &amp; conforte of the wyfe. Therfore was she also taken and created oute of the ryb or bone, and not out of the fleshe.</P>
<P>But in the circumstau~ce that followeth, shal euery thing be more playne afterward. For now
<PB N="iii" REF="21">
it followeth howe God gaue the woman vnto man, and how that he receaued and toke her.</P>
<P>God brought the woman vnto Adam, and as it is euident in the fyrst Chapter) he blyssed them and sayde vnto them, growe and multiplye, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ada~ &amp; Eu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> were maried togither.</NOTE> fyll the earth. Out of the which wordes we may perceaue clerely, that God was the fyrst causer of wedlocke, and fyrst dyd knyt them togyther, &amp; blyssed them. Nowe as soone as the woma~ was brought vnto Adam, &amp; gyuen vnto him, he sayd immediately: this is once bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh. Afore dyd Adam beholde &amp; con|sidre all beastes and lyuynge creatures here vpo~ earth, and gaue euery one his peculiare name ac cordyng to his kynde, but among all thynges ly|uynge he found none, to whome he myght beare an harte and mynde, namely to dwell by it, to loue it, and of it to procreate one lyke vnto him selfe. And therfore is it reason, that wythe fyre they be punyshed vnto death, which agaynst all kynde and nature of man, haue to do with bea|stes, and not only with women.</P>
<P>As soone now as the woman was set before Ada~, he knowledged immmediatly, that she was <NOTE PLACE="marg">Occasion of loue and con sent into ma riage.</NOTE> for his purpose, that he lyked her well, &amp; that he could fynde in his harte to loue her, as one that was of his owne kynde, of his owne bloud, flesh of his fleshe, and bone of his bone. For thoughe
<PB REF="22">
he slepte, and the woman was created out of his rybbe, yet sawe he well that she was lyke hym &amp; suche one as he hytherto had not found amonge all other lyuynge creatures. God also had pla~ted the~ the kynde, the loue, the harte, the inclinacion &amp; naturall affeccion that it besemeth the one to haue towarde the other. Lyke as Ada~ nowe had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">yuen all other beastes theyr names according to the fyrst originall &amp; operacion of theyr kynd, so gyueth he nowe a name also vnto the wyfe, &amp; calleth her Ischa, that is to say, of man, because she was taken out of the man.</P>
<P>The~ foloweth it farther in Moses. For this cause shall a ma~ leaue his father and mother, &amp; cleaue vnto his wyfe, &amp; they two shalbe into one flesh. These wordes doth Adam (or t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s Moses) <NOTE PLACE="marg">The knotte &amp; coueuaunt of mariage.</NOTE> speake yet out of the mouth of God, &amp; therby de clarethe the dewty knot and couenau~t of maried folkes, namely that the hyghest loue, bonde and vnite among them, should be this, that no man separate them asunder, but only deathe. This de clareth he with two speciall poyntes. Fyrst, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> is no ma~ (nexte vnto God) derer vnto vs by all reason, the~ is our father and mother. But wha~ they wyll make discorde betwene maried folkes, God commau~deth a man in that behalfe to for|sake father &amp; mother, &amp; to kepe hym to his wyfe. The loue therfore in mariage ought to be nexte
<PB N="iiii" REF="22">
vnto God) aboue all loues. The seconde: They two, saythe he, shall be into one fleshe, that is to saye, one body. Nowe lyke as the greatest loue, the moost excellent and vnpayneful seruyce, di|ligence and earnest labour, is in the partes of a ma~s body, one doyng for another, one louynge, defendyng, helpyng &amp; forbearynge another, suffe rynge, also lyke ioye &amp; lyke payne one with ano|ther. Euen so ought it to be betwene man &amp; wo man in wedlocke. And lyke as the partes of a mans body seperate not the~ selues one fro~ ano|ther afore death, eue~ so must wedlocke be a knot vnlooseable. And lyke as the partes of a mans body, whan they are sundred one from another conceaue an exceadynge great anguysh, dolour and payne, euen so ought it to he an exceadynge grefe for marryed folkes to be seperated.</P>
<P>And thus Moses, ouer &amp; besydes that he de|clareth y^e fyrst originall of holy wedlocke, layeth also the foundacion of lawes matrimonyal, out of the which all other statutes are taken. After the fall of Ada~ &amp; Eue, there was nothyng added further vnto wedlocke, neyther altered in those thynges that were ordyned, sauyng that, by rea|son of the faull and synne, there was sorow and payne layd vpon the~ both, and vpon vs all. For vnto man it was sayd: In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread. &amp;c. And vnto the woma~
<PB REF="23">
sayde God: I wyll surelye encreace thy sorowe whan thou art with chylde, &amp; wythe payne shal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> thou be delyuered, and to y^e husbande shalt thou haue respecte, and vpon his pleasure depende.

<P>Thus much thought I to shew out of Moses that excelle~t seruau~te of God, wha~, where, how, of whom, &amp; partly for what intent, holy wedlock was instituted namely, how that God himselfe in Paradyse, at y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> begynnyng of the world (eue~ in the tyme of ma~s innoce~cy &amp; prosperite) ordey|ned thus for the welth of ma~, that one ma~ &amp; one woma~ ioyned togither shulde be one bodye, one to loue the other aboue al thinges next vnto god the one to be coupled to the other without sepa|racion, one to helpe &amp; socour y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> other, and in the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">are of God to bring vp theyr childre~, And this is in a maner the whole summe of the one parte of this boke.</P>

Nowe where as some of the holy fathers had more wy|ues than one, those were but the Actes of certen priuate men, and not such general examples, as are thorowly to be followed.</P>
<P>Agayne, the priuate dede of some, or of many men, make no common lawe. The Lorde in the fore rehearsed place of Mathewe, dyd alleadge &amp; renew y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> olde law of mariage agayne. Therfore he that nowe wyll bryng in the multitude of wi ues, shall follow more the rule of Mahumet, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> of Christ.</P>
<P>Moreouer by yokynge, ioynyng, or couplyng do I vnderstande not only an outwarde dwel|lynge togyther, but also an vniforme agremen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> of mynd, &amp; a comon participacion of bodye and goodes, for asmuch as the Lord sayth playnely: And they two, shall be into one flesh, that is, one body.

<P>Furthermore, wedlocke must not onely be a couplyng togyther, but it must also be such a cou plynge togither as commeth of God, and is not contrary to hys worde and wyll. For where as
<PB REF="25">
certayne men do alleadge out of the holy gospell (what God hath cowpled togyther, let not man separate) &amp; conclude theron, that whan two par|sonnes come once togyther, &amp; the one hath taken the other, it must nedes be fast, &amp; no man maye breake y^e band. Such me~ haue not so good respect to the wordes of the Lorde, as they shoulde. For the Lord sayd not&punc; what so euer is coupled togy|ther, ought not or maye not be separated. But thus he sayd: What God hath coupled togither <NOTE PLACE="marg">Let not man separate y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> God hathe coupled togi ther.</NOTE> let not man separate.

<P>There be many whome God coupled not to gyther, but carnal lust, mony, good, flattery, dro~ kennes, a fleshely arme and frendeshyppe, where God is not thought vpon, &amp; therfore synne they the more agaynst hym.

<P>Elles yf there be parell presente, that the one shalbe caryed away vnto errour, then hath not onely the lawe in the olde Testamente spoken there agaynst, but Paule also commaundeth in the second to the Corinthians the sixte chapter, sayeng: Beare not a strau~g yoke with infidels. For what felowshyp hathe righteousnes wythe vnryghteousnes? What company hathe lyghte with darkenesse? What concorde hathe Christe wyth Belial? Or what parte hathe the beleuer with an Infidell?

<P>Mariage is a co~mon participacion of mynde body, &amp; goodes. Now sayth Paule: What vnyte can a faythfull beleuer haue wyth and infydeler.

And verely what woma~ so euer ta|keth an vnbeleuyng ma~, must drawe after hym in vnbeleue, yea &amp; do, se, &amp; heare that whiche is cleane contrary vnto fayth, and hurteful to her soule. The chyldren also shalbe brought vp in in fidelite. And thoughe it come not to passe whyle the parentes be alyue, yet happeneth it after the death of the faythfull? Whyle such yoked folkes also are alyue, there is no tranquilite: &amp; finally the beleuer must be in continuall discorde wyth the vnbeleuer, or els must he graunt vnto her &amp; so do agaynst God, agaynst his own soule, and agaynst his conscience. Therfore must we take good aduisement afore hand, leest we yoke oure selues, our fre~des or our chyldren with vnfayth ful people, to the great hurt of our selues &amp; ours</P>

And yf an woma~ haue an vn beleuyng husbonde, &amp; he consent to dwell wythe her, let her not departe from hym. For the vnbe leuyng husbonde is sanctifyed by the wyfe, and the vnbeleuynge wyfe is sanctifyed by the hus|band. Els were your chyldren vnclene, but now are they holy.

We must therfore put a difference be|twene it that is done already, and it that is yet to do. A wedlocke is it (no doubte) that after the common custome and law is openly and iuste|ly celebrated, of euery man estemed for wedlock.

Neyther oughte men therfore immediately to conclude &amp; saye: Myne vnsemely mariage is therfore no mariage at al.</P>

<P>It plesed not Paul, that in wedlocke al hope should be sodenly cast of for vnbeleues sake, and vyolence ministred to seperacion.

For to haue chyldren is the greatest treasure. For in the chyl dren do the parentes lyue (in a maner) eue~ after theyr deathe.

For there be other causes also, for the whiche wedlocke was ordeyned, and for the whiche it is contracted.</P>
<P>And namely it is contracted lykewyse of the faythfull, to the entente that they maye auoyde <NOTE PLACE="marg">To auoyde whoredome</NOTE> whoredome and all maner of vnclennes.

But to auoyd whore|dome, let euery man haue a wyfe of hys owne, &amp; euery woman her owne husband.

<P>It foloweth yet more playnely in Paul, how <NOTE PLACE="marg">The worke of martimo ny is no syn.</NOTE> that he not onely vouch saueth the worke of wed locke to them that be maried, but commaundeth also (yee and taketh away the priuate power of either of them both therin) &amp; sayeth clearly, that nether of them maye denye vnto the other the dewe worke of matrymonye. Let the husbande, (sayth he) geue vnto the wife dewe beneuolence. Likewise the wife vnto the husband.

But Paul co~maundeth the~ to mary the one to geue dewe beniuolence vnto the other no doubt for the auoydyng of whordo~e &amp; eschui~g of vncle~nesse. For it foloweth in Paul immediatly after: The wyfe hath not power of hir awne bodye, but the husbande: Lykewyse the husband hath not power of hys awne body, but the wife. Wherby he forbyddethe, that nether of the~ shall denye his body vnto the tother. For <NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. ix.</NOTE> they two, sayth the Lorde also, are one bodye.</P>

For Paule in the same chapter speakyng of wydowes &amp; wydowers saiethe that it is good yf they so remayne, but immediatelye addeth he therto, sayenge: Neuerthelesse, yf they can not absteine, let them mary. For better it is to marye the~ to burne. And within a litle after he sayth moreouer: But and yf thou take a wife thou synnest not. Beholde, what could be more clerely spoke~: To mary (sayth the Apostle) is no synne, then must it folow also that the worckes of mariage are not synne, not of the~ selues but because of the mariage selfe &amp; gods ordinaunce.</P>
<P>And that more is then all that we haue yet <NOTE PLACE="marg">Uirginite is &amp; holy &amp; ex cellent thing.</NOTE> spoken of, it foloweth farther in Paul: And yf a virgyn mary he or she synneth not.

In the which wordes, Salomo~ like as Paule also co~mendeth and prayseth the loue and worke of mariage as clenlynesse, but draweth men from whoredom as from it that is nothing but fylthy.

<P>Paul, Ephe. v. sayeth thus: ye wyues, sub|mytt <NOTE PLACE="marg">The dewtye &amp; obedience of wyues.</NOTE> your selues vnto your husbandes, as vnto the lorde. For the husband is the wyues heade, like as Christ also is the head of the congregati|on, &amp; sauyour of hys body. Now as the congre|gacion or church is in subiection vnto Christe so let the wiues also be in subiection to theyr hus bandes in all thynges. First doth Paule speake of the obedie~ce, that maried weme~ owe to theyr husbandes. Let the weme~ sayth he be in subiecti|on, that is to say, seruiseable &amp; obedie~t vnto their
<PB REF="73">
husbandes. And addeth therto, that they must esteme this obedience none otherwyse, then yf it where shewed vnto god himselfe. Wherout it fo loweth, that the sayde obedience extendethe not vnto wickednesse &amp; euell, but vnto that whiche is good, honest, and comely. In asmuche as god deliteth onely in goodnesse, and forbyddeth euell euery where. It foloweth also, that the disobe|die~ce, whiche wiues shew vnto their husbandes displeaseth god no lesse, the~ whan he is resisted hymselfe.</P>
<P>Secondly, Paul doth lykewyse adde the occa <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">he husba~d is the heade of the wyfe.</NOTE> sion, whye wemen oughte to be subieccion to theyr husbandes. Euen because the husbonde is the wifes heade. Whych, sayenge he toke oute of the thyrde chapter of Gene, where it is wrytten thus: And the lorde sayde vnto y^e woma~. Thou shalt depend and wait vpon thy husba~des beck, him shalt thou feare, and he shall haue aucthori te ouer the. Thus wryteth Paule himself. i. Ti moth. ii. I suffre not a woma~ to teach or preach or to haue dominion ouer her husband. For A|dam was first made and the~ Eua. And Adam was not disceaued but the woman was discea|ued, and brought in the transgressyon. For as|much then as the mastershippe and takynge of auctorite vpon her could not well be dryuen out of the woman, therfore god to punyshe the sin|ne,
<PB N="liiii" REF="73">
humbled her, made her fearfull and subdued her. Such punyshment and ordinaunce of God ought they to regarde, and wyth a good wyll (ac cordyng to the commaundement of the Lorde, to obey theyr husbandes, leest they fall into Gods wrathe and into further punyshment.</P>
<P>But to the intent that the husband shall not <NOTE PLACE="marg">Howe y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> hus|bande <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> the head.</NOTE> turne hys aucthorite vnto tyrany, therfore doth Paule declare, after what maner and howe the husbande is the wyues heade. The husbande (saythe he) is the wyfes head, euen as Christ is the head of hys congregacion. Nowe is Christ so the heade of the congregacion, that he shewethe vnto it the same thyng, whiche the head sheweth vnto the bodye. The head seeth and hearethe for the whole body, ruleth and gydethe the body and geueth it strength of lyfe. Euen so doth Christ defende, teache &amp; preserue his congregacion. To be shorte, he is the sauioure, conforte, eye, harte, wisdome and gyde therof. Therfore muste the husbandes be heades vnto the wyues in lyke ma ner, to shewe them lyke kyndenes, and after the same fashyon to guyde them and rule them with discresion for theyr preseruacion, and not wyth force and wylfulnesse to entreate them.</P>
<P>Thyrdly, Paul setteth an ensample to the wi ues howe they must be obedient &amp; behaue the~ sel ues vnto theyr husbandes, &amp; saythe: Lyke as the
<PB REF="74">
chyrche is in subieccio~ to Christ, so let the wome~ <NOTE PLACE="marg">How the wy+ues muste o+beye and be|haue them sel+ues.</NOTE> be in subieccio~ to theyr husbondes in all thinges But howe is the chyrche in subieccio~ to y^e Lord? She hath respecte only vnto hym, &amp; dependethe vpon his worde. As for straunge &amp; fond husban+des, she harkeneth not vnto them, but kepeth her selfe pure and cleane (and that continually) vnto hym in all faythfulnes: Loke what Christ com+man~deth her, y^e receueth she into her harte, &amp; doth it: Contrary to Christ and wythout his wyll &amp; worde, dothe she nothyng. For in euery thyng y^t she goethe aboute, she seakethe and requireth for Christes worde, she loueth Christ only &amp; aboue al thynges, she is glad and wyllyng to suffer for Christes sake, she doeth all for the loue of hym. Christ only is her conforte, ioye and altogither. Upon Christ is her thought day &amp; nyght, she lo~ gethe onely after Christ, for Christes sake also (if it maye serue to his glory) is she hartely well content to dye, yea she gyueth ouer herselfe whol+ly therto for Christes loue, knowyng assuredly, that her soule, her houour, body, lyfe and all that she hathe, is Christes owne. Thus also must euery honest wyfe submit her selfe, to serue her husband wythe all her power, and gyue herselfe ouer frely and wyllyngly, neuer to forsake hym tyll the houre of death: to hold her content wyth her husbande, to loue hym onely, to harken vnto
<PB N="lv" REF="74">
hym, &amp; in all thynges to order her selfe after hys commaundement. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Nowe followeth it in Paule lykewyse, what <NOTE PLACE="marg">The dewtys and loue of husbandes.</NOTE> the husbandes owe to theyr wyues, &amp; how they ought to loue them. Ye husbandes, sayth he, loue your wyues, as Christ loued the congregacion, and gaue hymselfe for it, to sanctify i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">, and hath clensed it. &amp;c. The husbandes dewetye is to loue hys wyfe. Nowe is loue ge~tle and frendly, she is not disdaynefull, she seketh not her owne profyt she is not proude, she is not pufte vp, she is not hastely prouoked vnto wrathe, she takethe not a thyng soone to the worste, she is not lothsome &amp; tedious, but feruente &amp; seruiseable, and therfore (as we sayde afore) the husbande is the wyues head, that is, her defender, teacher and conforte. Yet nedeth it no farther declaracio~, for as muche as Saynt Paule hymselfe sheweth the maner &amp; fashyon of the loue, that is, howe they oughte to loue theyr wyues, and sayth: Ye men loue youre <NOTE PLACE="marg">How menne shoulde loue theyr wyues.</NOTE> wyues, as Christ loueth the co~gregacion. Howe dyd Christ loue the congregacion. It is wryt|ten: No ma~ hath greater loue, than he y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> ieopar|deth his lyfe for his frend. Such loue hath christ shewed to his congregacion. For it followeth in Paul: Christ gaue hymselfe for it. For what in tent: Euen to sanctify it and to clense it.</P>
