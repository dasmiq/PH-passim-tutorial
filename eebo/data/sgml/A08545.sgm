<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>OF ALL THAT HAPPE|ned</HI> vnto the Emperour Trebatio and the Princesse Bri|ana in their way vnto the Grecian Empire. CHAPTER. I.</HEAD>
<P>_WIth great ioy and contentment, the <HI>Em|perour Trebatio</HI> and the Princesse <HI>Bria|na</HI> trauailed towardes the <HI>Grecian Empire,</HI> as well for the fruition of hir contented ioy, as the pleasure and ease which she hoped to haue, at such time as sh&eacute;e should come vnto the <HI>Empire.</HI> And if it had fallen out that their departure should haue bene knowen, yet at their ease they could not follow them, for that most of their trauaile was by deserts and vninhabited places, and not by peopled townes &amp; vila|ges: and this was the occasion that they could not come so seene vnto <HI>Grecia</HI> as they might, if they had taken the fre|quented waye. And so in great peace and quietnesse they trauailed certaine daies without any accident happaning that is worth the noting, till such time as they had passed through y^e kingdome of <HI>Hungaria,</HI> &amp; entered among certaine mountaines which wer very craggie &amp; troublesome to tra|uaile in, where they chaunced vpon the skirt of the moun|taine
<PB REF="6">
<HI>Sarpedo,</HI> which is verye great, and was inhabited with very furious and vnciuile people. This was the cause which made them to trauaile by the lowest part of the mountaine, where they continued on their iourney till the third day, at such tyme as the Sunne was in the extrea|mest of his parching heate, which caused them to haue an earnest and great desire to drinke, for that they were thyr|stie, by reason that all that daye, and the other day past, they could finde no water, nor any other thing to drinke.</P>
<P>And b&eacute;ecause the great thirst which the <HI>Empresse</HI> sus|tayned was more griefe vnto the <HI>Emperour</HI> then his owne, h&eacute;e diligentlye searched in euery place where he came, to s&eacute;e if h&eacute;e could by any meanes finde any Towne, Uilage, or Fountayne, where they myght haue water to quench theyr thirst.</P>
<P>And h&eacute;e as trauayled in this care and sorrow, within a whyle after h&eacute;e discouered a certayne valley which entred in by the one side of the Mountayne, &amp; in the middest there|of there was as it were a sluce which proc&eacute;eded out of the Mountayne: and it s&eacute;emed vnto him, that it could not h&eacute;e without water, for that the ground about it was very fresh and pleasant.</P>
<P>And presentlye leauing theyr way that they then followed, they tooke the next way which lead them vnto the valley, and with great trauaile they came thether, in the ende whereof they found sufficient of that where|of they had such n&eacute;ede. For that out of the foote of a high &amp; mightie Rocke, the principall beginning of that mountaine, there was a small valley lyke vnto a medow, being verie gr&eacute;ene and fresh, &amp; on the one side it was inclosed with that mightie Rocke, and on the other side inuironed with great and thicke trees of all sortes, both delectable and pleasaunt.</P>
<P>This valley was very playne, and out of the cliftes of that rocke, there issued a sweete and a christalline foun|tayne of most excellent cleare water, which ran into the middest of that valley, whereas it made a stange: b&eacute;e|ing
<PB N="2" REF="6" MS="y">
very pleasaunt to beholde. Likewise they saw in that high Rocke, certayne steppes cut out of the hard stone like vnto stayres, which assended vp vnto a dore which was in the sayde Rocke, and it s&eacute;emed to b&eacute;e aboue fift&eacute;ene <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">adome high.</P>
<P>And they saw that by the dore there was cut out of the same Rocke, holes like vnto windowes, which made them thinke there should be some habitacion or dwelling in the same. And for that the place was very delightfull, it dyd in a manner inuite them to refresh themselues. There the <HI>Emperour</HI> alighted from his horse, and made him fast vn|to a Tr&eacute;e, and tooke the <HI>Empresse</HI> in his armes from hir paulfrie, the lyke dyd hee to all the <HI>Ladyes</HI> and <HI>Damosells,</HI> and they went vnto the Fountayne whereas they did sa|tisfie themselues of theyr desire, thinking all their trauaile well b&eacute;estowed, to come vnto that pleasant and delightfull place.</P>
<P>Then they sate themselues downe, by the head of that spring, and did eate of such meate as <HI>Clandestria</HI> hadde brought with hir: and this mighty <HI>Emperour</HI> had for his table the lappe of the <HI>Empresse,</HI> which he did more est&eacute;eme then all the great abundance of siluer and gold and other furniture in his royall and princely court. Also they re|ceiued wonderfull great pleasure and contentment at the sw&eacute;ete and pittering noyse which the running water made, which by reason of the swiftnesse of his course s&eacute;emed to bee a Fountayne of christall, for the great clearenesse thereof.</P>
<P>And when they had eaten and well refreshed themselues with that which they brought, the <HI>Emperour</HI> dyd pull of his healme, and stretched out his body vppon the gr&eacute;ene grasse, and laide his head on the <HI>Princesse</HI> lappe. And after that h&eacute;e hadde discoursed with the <HI>Princesse</HI> many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">w&eacute;et and amorous sp&eacute;eches, h&eacute;e fell a sl&eacute;epe, wherefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">he Princesse hadde great care of him and commaunded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ell hir <HI>Gentlewomen</HI> to k&eacute;epe silence and to make no noyse
<PB REF="7">
for feare of waking of him, and she was well contented in hir minde that they were passed the Kingdome of <HI>Hunga|ria,</HI> hoping in a short time to enter into the great Empire of <HI>Grecia.</HI> But all this in comparison was nothing vnto the great loue &amp; contented ioy that she receiued, to s&eacute;e that no|ble <HI>Emperour</HI> lie a long with his head on hir lap, and sub|iect vnto hir loue, very much beholding the great seueritie and couragious countenaunce of his faire face, marking his mightie members, and the good proportion of his whole bo|die. And as hee lay vpon the grasse, it seemed to hir that in|all the world ther was not his like to be s&eacute;ene, he was of so excellent a stature and worthy to b&eacute;e b&eacute;eloued aboue all o|ther. And for that the <HI>Princesse</HI> by experience was fully per|swaded of his noble prowesse, shee sayd vnto hir selfe, that ther was not in all the world <HI>lady</HI> or <HI>gentlewoman,</HI> that had better chaunce then she, affirming that although <HI>Fortune</HI> in times past did shew hir selfe cruel, yet at that time she had recompenced hir with more honour and delight, higher dig|nitie and prosperitie then euer she possessed, or thought at any time to attaine vnto. But as it is a thing both gene|rall and common, that at such time as a man thinketh him|selfe to haue most felicitie in this mortall lite, he is n&eacute;erest vnto perills, hauing sodainlye all his mirth tourned into mourning, with misch&eacute;efes vnlooked for: so at this present it happened, for in the meane time that the <HI>Emperour</HI> tooke his rest vpon the lappe of the fayre <HI>Princesse,</HI> and shee like|wise remayned in the toppe of hir prosperitie, all hir Gen|tlewomen being at a Fountaine, washing their hands and faces with that fayre and christaline water, vpon a sodaine and vnaware they heard a great norse amongst the tr&eacute;es, and shrikes that s&eacute;emed to be of women that came toward the place wheras they were, with sorrowfull weepings and lamentecions. The Princesse and all hir Gentlewomen b&eacute;eing amazed at that sodaine noise, saw come forth from among the tr&eacute;es towards the Fountaine, a mightie great and deformed <HI>Gyant,</HI> all armed, sauing the beauer of his healme was vp, and mounted on a mightie horse, hauing in
<PB N="3" REF="7" MS="y">
his hand a great boare speare, which had a very sharp and long blade of a span broad, and he had a fierce and furious countenance, which caused great feare vnto all them that did behold him. After him there followed ten men (meruai|lous vglie and ill fauoured to behold, and no lesse dreadfull) which wer on foote all vnarmed, with a certaine kind of vn|vsed wepons in their hands, who brought in the middest a|mongst them two knights vpon one horse, with their hands fast bound, and two Ladies vpon two palfrayes, which gaue very great and sorrowfull shrikes. But when the <HI>Princesse</HI> saw that monstrous <HI>Gyaunt</HI> come foorth of the thicket, sh&eacute;e gaue lykewise a great shrike, and quaked for feare, in such sort that sh&eacute;e had no more coulour in hir face then a dead body: at which noyse, as well of the <HI>Ladyes</HI> and <HI>Gentle|women,</HI> as of the <HI>Princesse,</HI> the <HI>Emperour</HI> awaked out of his sound sl&eacute;epe, as one that had b&eacute;ene greatlye afrighted, and looking about him h&eacute;e saw that monstrous and vglie <HI>Gyant</HI> with all his internall company comming towardes them: wherefore with a trice h&eacute;e rose vp and laced on his healme, and came vnto the <HI>Princesse,</HI> who was as one that had b&eacute;ene dead, and sayd vnto hir: Take a good hart and b&eacute;e couragious, for it grieueth m&eacute;e very much to s&eacute;e you in this plight, for I doubt not, (such courage receiue I by your presence, but principallie God asisting m&eacute;e) to de|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">iuer you from this monster. The <HI>Princesse</HI> was so trou|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">led and in such feare, that she had not any power to an|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">were him one word agayne: And at that time she would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">aue giuen all the Grecian Empire, yea, the whole world <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">f it had b&eacute;ene hirs, to haue s&eacute;ene hir selfe and the Empe|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">our cleere from that monstrous <HI>Gyant.</HI> At this time the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">reat <HI>Gyaunt</HI> came vnto the place whereas they were, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">nd greatlie meruailed to see them there, although to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ontrarie reioycing, and verye much delighted with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">are and excellent beautie of the <HI>Princesse,</HI> with a dread|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ull and horse voyce hee sayde.</P>
<P><PB REF="8">Oh my Gods, what a rich pray is this that you haue re|serued for m&eacute;e, these fift&eacute;ene y&eacute;eres haue I attempted no other thing but to rob <HI>Ladyes</HI> and <HI>Gentlewomen,</HI> with no lesse per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ll then paynes, and yet all this time haue I not met with one, that so much doth content m&eacute;e as this <HI>Lady,</HI> and in deliuering these words he approched vn to the <HI>Empe|rour,</HI> and sayde.</P>
<P>Tell mee thou vnhappy <HI>Knight</HI> by what euill fortune art thou come hether vnto this place? The <HI>Emperour</HI> who at that time was very angry to heare his diuellish words, and againe to see the <HI>Princesse</HI> so changed, with a stout cou|rage and wrathfull countenaunce answered him.</P>
<P>Tell m&eacute;e thou brute beast, wherfore doest thou in this manner extoll and prayse thy selfe of so euill and diuellish a custome, knowing that there is a God in heauen that will punish th&eacute;e for these thy euill workes which thou doest vse.</P>
<P>The <HI>Gyant</HI> was exc&eacute;eding wrathfull when the <HI>Empe|rour</HI> speake thus, so that he made no reckoning to answere him, but giuing a terrible &amp; hoarse cry, he threw that great and big Boare <HI>Speare</HI> which h&eacute;e brought, at the <HI>Emperour,</HI> with so great strength, &amp; in such sort, that if it had chanced a right with the broad end and steely point, I doubt whether his <HI>Magicall</HI> armour had b&eacute;ene sufficient to haue made re|sistance, but it would haue pearced thorough his body: but the <HI>Emperour</HI> fores&eacute;eing that perlilous blow, mith great lightnesse cl&eacute;ered hmiselfe from the fury thereof by leaping on the one side, so that the Boare speare stroke the ground, and with the great strength wehrewith it was throwen, it entered more then halfe the length therof into the earth.</P>
<P>Which when the valiaunt and couragious Em|perour saw, and finding himselfe to bee so nigh vn|to daunger, the Gyaunt b&eacute;eing on horsebacke, and con|sidering the great aduantage which hee hadde, straight wayes layde holde vppon the bridle of the Horse,
<PB N="4" REF="8" MS="y">
and with his strong armed fist stroke the horse such a vlow vpon the head, that he made the braynes flye out, &amp; h&eacute;e fell to the ground master and all.</P>
<P>The <HI>Gyant</HI> seeing that, with great hast cl&eacute;ered himselfe from his horse, &amp; being on soote, drew out a mightie &amp; broad faulchon, which hung at his girdle and approched vnto the <HI>Emperour,</HI> striking him so great and mightye a blow vppon his healme, that he could not otherwise choose, but that h&eacute;e was constrained to stoope with both his knees to the ground, which did somewhat trouble his remembraunce, but this mightie <HI>Emperour</HI> quickly b&eacute;e thought himselfe agayne, and tooke his sharpe sword in both his hands, and stroke the <HI>Gi|ant</HI> such a blow vpon his thigh, that although his armour was a finger thicke of hard St&eacute;ele, besides a skirt of maile which he had hanging downe, neuerthelesse he cut all a sun|der, &amp; entered through the flesh vnto the hard bone, wher he made a sore wound, from whence great abundance of bloud ran out. The <HI>Gyant</HI> f&eacute;eling himselfe thus wounded, &amp; seeing so great resistaunce to be made with one alone <HI>Knight,</HI> rea|red as though it had b&eacute;ene a <HI>Lyon.</HI> At which noise together with the rushing of theyr harneys, and the sound of theyr mighty blowes, there appeared out of the windowes of the Rocke another <HI>Gyant,</HI> which vnto his seeming was no lesse furious and vglie of semblaunce then the other, who seeing that mighty and well foughten battaile betw&eacute;ene the <HI>Em|perour</HI> &amp; his brother, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> as great hast as was possible for him, he went and armed himselfe. In the meane time the other <HI>Gyant</HI> and the <HI>Emperour</HI> made theyr battale with so great and heauie blowes that the noyse thereof did sound throughout all those mountaynes.</P>
<P>And the more that this <HI>Gyaunt</HI> did force himselfe to strike the <HI>Emperour,</HI> so much the more did the <HI>Emperour</HI> pro|uide to cl&eacute;ere himselfe with great lightnesse from his terri|ble strokes, for that h&eacute;e knew very well it would be very per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">llous, if h&eacute;e should fasten on him but one full blow,
<PB REF="9">
neuerthelesse the <HI>Emperour</HI> at all times did wounde him at his pleasure, in such sort, that what with the strength of the <HI>Giaunt,</HI> and the great pollicie and lightnesse of the <HI>Emperour</HI> the battayle was brought into great doubt, al|though the <HI>Gyaunt</HI> had lost very much bloud by these woundes which the Emperour had giuen him. For when h&eacute;e saw his bloud in such sort scattered vpon the ground, hee was more furious then b&eacute;efore, and with great wrath h&eacute;e b&eacute;esturred himselfe with his Fauchon, cursing himselfe and blaspheming against his Gods, in that h&eacute;e could not in any wise fasten one full blow vpon his enimie, and that one Knight should bring him into so great a per|plexitie. All this while the <HI>Empresse</HI> and hir <HI>Gentlewomen</HI> did very well behold that wonderfull battayle, &amp; had great feare to s&eacute;e the hugenesse of the <HI>Gyant,</HI> and perill in which the <HI>Emperour</HI> was, and so amazed, they were that they could not mooue themselues out of the place whereas they abode, but euery one of them on their kn&eacute;es very earnestly pray|ed vnto <HI>God</HI> with many teares, to deliuer them from that great agonie wherein they were.</P>
<P>And being in this agonie, they heard within the Rocke <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> great noyse &amp; rushing of armour, wherewith they looked a|bout, &amp; saw descending downe the stayres another <HI>Giant,</HI> all armed, of no lesse bignesse &amp; dreadfull countenance then the other, who came downe in great hast, with a mightie ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e of St&eacute;ele in his hand. When the <HI>Princesse</HI> and hir <HI>Gentlewo|men</HI> saw him, they were more afraid then at the first, &amp; y&eacute;el|ded themselues vnto destruction, &amp; therwith gaue meruay|lous &amp; grieuous shrikes &amp; cries, which was the cause that the <HI>Emperour</HI> was in a great feare of some misfortune, and looking about him to s&eacute;e what it might be, he perceiued ano|ther monstrous <HI>Gyaunt</HI> that discended downe his stayres with his mase in his hand: &amp; although h&eacute;e did s&eacute;e the great danger and perill at hand, yet did not his hart faile him one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ot, but with a noble and stout stomacke his strength
<PB N="5" REF="9" MS="y">
the more increased, so that forgetting all the tra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ayle a|gainst that <HI>Gyant,</HI> with new strength hee str<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">k the <HI>Gyaunt</HI> with both his hands such a blow ouerthwart the wast, that the thicke armour and skirt of maile had not sufficient strength to make defence against his mightie and strong arme, but that the sharp cutting sword must needes execute his fury, which diuiding both armour and bones, entered in|to the bowells, wherewith the <HI>Gyant</HI> with grieuous pangs of death straight waies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ell downe to the ground, and with his fall made all the earth to&punc;shake.</P>
<P>At which time the other <HI>Gyaunt</HI> was come downe the stayres, and seeing that terrible and cruell stroke, hee lyft vp his eyes to heauen, and with &agrave; loude voyce h&eacute;e saide. Oh cruell and cursed Gods in whome I b&eacute;el&eacute;eue and wor|ship, which of all you is it that hath co~sented vnto the death of my brother <HI>Argentaria?</HI> in what sort or how shall I bee reuenged of so great an outrage done vnto mee, you b&eacute;eing aboue in the heauens, and I h&eacute;ere vpon the earth.</P>
<P>And in saying these and such lyke wordes hee came to|wards the <HI>Emperour,</HI> with his mightie mase raysed in the ayre, in such forme, that it was most dreadfull to b&eacute;eholde: but this valyaunt <HI>Greeke</HI> whose strength was nothing in|feriour vnto his predecessors, the mightie <HI>Achilles, Pyrrhus,</HI> and <HI>Molosso,</HI> for when h&eacute;e saw the <HI>Gyaunt</HI> comming tow|ards him in that terrible sort, and so fiercely, in great hast h&eacute;e went whereas the Boare Speare stuck, and with exc&eacute;eding strength h&eacute;e pulled it out of the ground, and tooke it fast in his hand about the middest of the staffe, and ther|with h&eacute;e stayed and abode the comming of the <HI>Gyaunt,</HI> who as soone as h&eacute;e was come within eyght or nine paces of him euen as one would throw a dart at a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">aighted <HI>Bull,</HI> so dyd this mightie <HI>Emperour</HI> lyft vp his rygorous arme, and with great strength threw that Boare Speare at the <HI>Gyaunt,</HI> and stroke him in the middest of the breast with so great strength, that passing through armour and flesh,
<PB REF="10">
the broad and St&eacute;ely poynt of the Boare Speare app&eacute;ered at his back all bloody. And the staffe thereof, by reason of the great streangth wherewith it was throwen, dyd shake in the <HI>Gyants</HI> body till such time as h&eacute;e fell downe dead to the ground.</P>
<P>The force of this strong and mightie blow gaue great con|tentment vnto the <HI>Princesse</HI> and hir <HI>Gentlewomen,</HI> and also on the other side those men that came with the <HI>Gyant</HI> were no les amazed when they saw their Lords dead, whom they thought to bee the mightiest and strongest in all the world, and although they were many in number, yet had they no courage to withstand the fury of the <HI>Emperour,</HI> and despay|ring in themselues, of theyr securitie, they all left their prisoners, and euerie one of them procured to saue him|selfe by running away and hiding them in the thickest of that Mountayne. Then the <HI>Emperour</HI> s&eacute;eing that there was no more to b&eacute;e done, but that all was finished with that blow, h&eacute;e reioyced very much, and went vnto the <HI>Princesse</HI> whereas shee stoode (who had lost the <HI>Roseall</HI> cou|lour of hir face) and with a gladde and ch&eacute;erefull counte|naunce h&eacute;e sayde vnto hir thus. Lady, now assure your selfe that these people shall no more trouble you. Then the Princesse who was almost in an extasie with the great pleasure sh&eacute;e receiued, when sh&eacute;e saw the <HI>Emperour</HI> returne vnto hir without any wound or hurt, and the wonderfull strength that sh&eacute;e saw in him, with great pleasure and de|lyght sh&eacute;e saw in him in hir armes and sayd.</P>
<P>My Lord I haue great cause to confesse this my security, hauing so strong and mightie a <HI>Knight</HI> in my companie, but for all that my heart could not but receiue great feare to s&eacute;e you in such daunger, with those terrible and vglie Monsters, and I assure you that many dayes will passe beefore I shall b&eacute;e able to cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">re my selfe of the great feare which by them I haue conceiued: so that these and many other lyke amorous words passed b&eacute;etwixt the <HI>Emperour</HI> and the <HI>Princesse.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="10" MS="y">Then the <HI>Emperour</HI> remembred himselfe of the priso|ners that they brought with them, and left the <HI>Princesse,</HI> and went towardes them, and dyd vnloose them of the bondes wherewith they were fast bound, and saw that the two Ladyes were very fayre and meruailous richlie appa|rayled, and the two <HI>Knights</HI> very well armed, and of a good proportion, although theyr armour in many pla|ces was broken and cut, and they themselues sore woun|ded, whereby issued from them very much blood.</P>
<P>These <HI>Knights</HI> and Ladyes dyd b&eacute;ehold all that passed, and saw with what valoure the <HI>Emperour</HI> dyd deale with those <HI>Gyaunts,</HI> and were greatly astonyed, meruayling who it should b&eacute;e, that beeing but one alone <HI>Knight,</HI> h&eacute;e should by his great myght and force ouercome two so mightie <HI>Gyaunts</HI> as those were, and in so short time as that. And s&eacute;eing themselues set at libertie by the noble and va|lyaunt prowesse of this <HI>Knight,</HI> they knew not how to gra|tifie that great benefit which they had receiued of him, but onely in gieuing him ceaselesse thanckes for the same.</P>
<P>The Emperour commaunded the Ladyes to bynde vp the wounds of the two <HI>Knights,</HI> that they myght loose no more blood: who dyd it with a very good will, for that they were theyr Husbands. And the <HI>Emperour</HI> asked of then who they were, and what was the occasion that the <HI>Gyaunt</HI> brought them prisoners in that sort.</P>
<P>Then one of the <HI>Knights</HI> sayd vnto him. Sir, you shall vnderstand that this <HI>Knight</HI> which you s&eacute;e h&eacute;ere and I are bretherin, and Lords ouer the seauen valleyes: if at any time you haue heard speaking of them. And they are sci|tuated b&eacute;etwixt <HI>Danubia</HI> and <HI>Transiluania,</HI> and are vnder the subiection of the mightie King of <HI>Hungarie,</HI> and these <HI>Gentlewomen</HI> which are with vs are our wyues, and are lykewyse two sisters. And as wee were for our recreati|on passing away the tyme with pleasure and delyght in the company of many <HI>Knights</HI> and <HI>Gentlewomen:</HI> in one of

the sayd valleys high adioyning vnto this Mountayne <HI>Sar|pedo,</HI> b&eacute;eing in the shadow vnder a Forrest side, hauing least care vpon any daunger or trouble, vpon a sodaine wee were beeset with this <HI>Gyant</HI> (that you first slew) and with his men, we defended our selues against the~ as well as w&eacute;e could, but in the ende h&eacute;e slew the most part of the <HI>Knights</HI> that were in our company, and the rest fled, so that w&eacute;e re|mayned all alone, and not beeing able to make any longer resistaunce against him, h&eacute;e tooke vs ioyntly with these two <HI>Gentlewomen,</HI> and brought vs in this sort as you haue s&eacute;en. And this is not the first robberie that these Gyaunts haue committed.</P>
<P>For that of long time they haue done great harme throughout all the Prouinces that are adioyning vnto this Mountayne. And as I haue heard reported of them, the meate which doth most content them is humane flesh, which doth make vs to b&eacute;el&eacute;eue verely, that if your soueraigne bountie, had not succoured vs in this great extremitie, in a short space w&eacute;e had b&eacute;ene eaten vp by these two <HI>Gyants</HI> and his people, and they vse most commonly to haue their habi|tation and dwelling in this <HI>Rocke</HI> which you s&eacute;e h&eacute;ere, for when they are within it, if all the world should come a|gainst them, they are able to make a long resistance.</P>
<P>And the <HI>Knight</HI> concluding with these words, the <HI>Empe|rour</HI> was very glad and ioyfull that h&eacute;e had rescewed and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">t them at libertie from so great a danger, for they s&eacute;emed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> him to be persons of no small estimation giuing great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> to almightie God, for that h&eacute;e had taken away the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> of so great an euill from that land.</P>
<P>And therewith they went all together vnto the Prin|ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">, who receiued them very cur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">eously. And straight wayes, sh&eacute;e was knowen by the <HI>Knights,</HI> for that many times before they had s&eacute;ene hir: where at b&eacute;eing very much amazed, they looked one vpon the other not knowing what to say.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Emperour</HI> perceiued that those <HI>Knights</HI> dyd

<P>When these <HI>Knights</HI> vnderstood the whole matter by the <HI>Emperour,</HI> they could not satisfie them in musing at so sod|dayne and straunge a m&eacute;eting. And falling on theyr knees beefore the <HI>Emperour</HI> and the <HI>Princesse,</HI> they required theyr hands to kisse them, but they with great ioye and pleasure dyd make them arise from the ground, and after that bee|tweene them there had passed many delightfull words of co~|ference, the <HI>Emperour</HI> sayd that h&eacute;e would go s&eacute;e what was within the <HI>Rock,</HI> and so h&eacute;e ascended vp the stayers tyll h&eacute;e came to the doore, which h&eacute;e found shut in such sort, that by no meanes hee could get in, neyther would they open the doore for all his great knocking. And as they might perceiue, those that remayned within that <HI>Rock</HI> were household ser|uaunts, and two sonnes of those Gyaunts, b&eacute;eing about the age of tenne y&eacute;eres, whom they saw at the windowes b&eacute;e|holding all that had passed, and they shut the doore very fast, and durst not open it, for that they thought verily y^t <HI>Knight</HI> would destroy them all, in so much that the <HI>Emperour</HI> was constrayned to retourne back agayne.</P>
<P>After a while that the <HI>Emperour</HI> and all the rest of the companie had eased and refreshed themselues by the <HI>Foun|taine,</HI> h&eacute;e and the <HI>Princesse</HI> determined to depart, and the <HI>Knights</HI> with their wiues would haue borne him company, and dyd desire very earnestly the <HI>Emperour</HI> to suffer them so to doe, yet h&eacute;e wold not consent thereto, but desired them to returne vnto theyr owne Countrie, and to let them so alone as they were, for that he had greater pleasure to tra|uaile in that sort, then with any more company. When these

<HI>Knights</HI> vnderstood his determination, they would not stand in contention with him, nor importune him any farther, but taking theyr leaue of the <HI>Princesse,</HI> they and theyr wyues dyd retourne vnto theyr owne countrie, hauing inough for all their lyfe tyme to declare that which they saw of the worthie <HI>Emperour Trebatio,</HI> and of his high bountie, b&eacute;el&eacute;e|uing that in all the world there was not a <HI>Knight</HI> like vn|to him.

<HEAD>How the Emperour Tiberio and the Princesse Briana ariued in the Empire of Grecia. Chap. 3.</HEAD>
<P>_WHen the comming of the <HI>Emperour Trebatio</HI> and the <HI>Princesse Briana</HI> into <HI>Grecia,</HI> was knowen vnto the Prince of that Prouince, who was a yong <HI>Knight</HI> and one of his sub|iects, h&eacute;e was very much amazed, and lyke|wyse all his Subiects, for that they thought verily that many y&eacute;eres past h&eacute;e had b&eacute;ene dead, and there was no other reckoning made of him, neyther would they b&eacute;el&eacute;eue his comming to bee true, till such time as euerie one of them dyd s&eacute;e him with their owne eyes. And b&eacute;eing certefied thereof, they dyd receiue him with such maiestie as the <HI>Emperour</HI> dyd remaine, and would not proc&eacute;ede a|ny farther, but first wholy and perfectly informed him|selfe of the estate of all things with-in the Empire. And there was giuen him to vnderstand how that the King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> had b&eacute;ene and was gouernour of all the whole
<PB N="8" REF="12" MS="y">
Empire, and how that h&eacute;e had ruled and gouerned it with great discretion and iustice. And how that all people gene|rally were very wel content with his gouernement, at the which the <HI>Emperour</HI> receiued great pleasure, and sent vnto him giuing him to vnderstand of his comming, with the <HI>Princesse Briana,</HI> certifying him by a briefe letter of all that h&eacute;e had passed, and willed him to m&eacute;ete him at <HI>Constanti|nople.</HI> When the King and all the nobles of the Empire, who at this present were in <HI>Constantinople,</HI> heard these newes, I am not h&eacute;ere able to expresse the great admirati|on that they had, and the exc&eacute;eding ioye that they in theyr hearts conceiued for that sodaine newes, in such sort that if each of them had receiued his owne Brother, they could haue possessed no more pleasure, h&eacute;e was so well beeloued. So in a short space these newes was published throughout all <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and was a meruailous thing to beehold the great pleasure and sports that, were in the Cittie, and generally amongst all the people.</P>
<P>Then the King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> with all those noble <HI>Prin|ces</HI> and Lords dyd ioyne themselues together, and depar|ted toward <HI>Dardania,</HI> whereas they receiued the <HI>Emperour</HI> and the <HI>Princesse Briana,</HI> and conducted them vnto the great Cittie of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> with such maiestie and pomp, that neuer Prince nor <HI>Romane Emperour</HI> was so receiued into his countrie.</P>
<P>And when they were come vnto <HI>Constantinople,</HI> that faire and royall <HI>Princesse Briana</HI> was crowned <HI>Empresse</HI> of <HI>Gre|cia,</HI> at which coronation was made the greatest Feasts and Triumphes, with such pompeous solempnity as neuer was in all the world b&eacute;efore that time. To which Triumph and Feasts, there dyd not onely come all the <HI>Princes,</HI> noble men, and valyant <HI>Knights</HI> naturall of the <HI>Empire,</HI> but also of all the <HI>Kingdomes</HI> and <HI>Prouinces</HI> which were nigh adioyning, vnto whom the newes came of the ariual of the great <HI>Em|perour Trebatio.</HI></P>
<P>And for that the excellent and mighty d&eacute;edes which the worthy <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> did in the Castell of <HI>Lindaraza,</HI>
<PB REF="13">
should b&eacute;e manifest vnto all people, and that the memory thereof should not b&eacute;e forgotten, the <HI>Emperour</HI> commaun|ded to call together all the best <HI>Painters</HI> that were in <HI>Gre|cia,</HI> and commaunded them to paynt vpon the fore front of his Pallaice, which was next adioyning vnto the great Court, in singular perfection, &amp; naturall sort, all the whole Iland, the Castle, the gates, and the terrible and wonder|full k&eacute;epers and gards, with the mightie and perilous bat|tayle that the <HI>Knight</HI> of the Sunne had with them, and of all the rest that happened for to cl&eacute;ere him of that inchant|ment, as hath bane told you in this Historie past. And when it, was concluded and set foorth in coulours, it was a thing very straunge to b&eacute;eholde, and of great admiration to all people that dyd looke thereon, insomuch that they could not b&eacute;el&eacute;eue, that any humane man was able to dooe so great d&eacute;edes of armes as was done by the <HI>Knight</HI> of the Sunne.</P>
<P>And all people had great desire to s&eacute;e him, although the <HI>Emperour</HI> had much more desire, with no lesse loue and good will, then if h&eacute;e had knowen him to b&eacute;e his naturall Sonne. And for that this great triumph shall b&eacute;e more spoken of in this Historie, at this present it doth leaue them tyll theyr time, and retourneth to tell you of all that passed in the Court of King <HI>Tiberio,</HI> when h&eacute;e knew of the departure of the <HI>Emperour Trebatio</HI> and of the <HI>Princesse Briana.</HI></P>

presumption thereof, till such time as the nyne dayes were past, and the tenth day come, &amp; s&eacute;eing not the chamber dore of the <HI>Princesse</HI> open they were all in a confusion, not know|ing what it should meane. So in this doubt they remayned vntill the eleuenth day, at which time not s&eacute;eing the cham|ber dore opened, they determined to goe thether, and began to call &amp; knocke at the dore, but ther was none that answe|red them, whereat b&eacute;eing more amazed, they knocked hard, and stroke mightie and great blowes at the dore, neuer the|lesse there was none that aunswered them, although they were there a great whyle knocking: and being much ama|zed thereat, they straight way gaue the Qu&eacute;ene of <HI>Augusta</HI> to vnderstand thereof, who was in the Citie of <HI>Buda,</HI> &amp; b&eacute;e|ing very much amazed at that sodayne newes, she called certayne of hir <HI>Knights</HI> &amp; <HI>Gentlewomen,</HI> and in their com|pany departed to the monestary. And when she came vnto the chamber dore of the <HI>Princesse,</HI> &amp; found none to answere hir, for all their great knocking, shee strayght waies com|maunded hir <HI>Knights</HI> to breake open the dore, and hatchets and other things being brought for the purpose, they broke open the dore, which done the Qu&eacute;ene with hir <HI>Knights</HI> and <HI>Gentlewomen</HI> entered the chamber, and not finding the <HI>Prin|cesse</HI> nor any other person therein, were very sore troubled &amp; amazed, she sat hir selfe downe vpon the floore, and knew nei|ther what to say or doe, but onely to lament and to make great sorrow. And as they were in this confusion they found the Letter that was written lying vppon the Table, and directed either to the King <HI>Tiberio,</HI> or vnto the Qu&eacute;ene, the which Letter they gaue strayght waye vnto the Qu&eacute;ene <HI>Augusta,</HI> who with great anguish did open the same, and saw thereon written all the whole Hostorye of the mightie <HI>Emperour Trebatio</HI> and the <HI>Princesse Briana,</HI> with the true relation thereof, till such time as they de|parted, and in the end of the <HI>Letter</HI> they craued pardon for that they went away in such sort as they had done, without giuing them to vnderstande thereof, alleadging
<PB REF="14">
the reason to b&eacute;e for the death of the Prince <HI>Edward,</HI> for that the <HI>King Oliuerio,</HI> father vnto the Prince, should not with any reason haue cause to quarrell with the <HI>King Tiberio,</HI> neyther account him as pertaker in the death of the Prince.</P>
<P>So when the Qu&eacute;ene vnderstoode the effect of the Let|ter, sh&eacute;e remayned all astonied and amazed, not knowing whether she might giue credit vnto so strange a thing as this was, although to the contrary sh&eacute;e receyued exceeding great ioy and pleasure, for the good fortune of the Princesse hir Daughter, that in all hir life she felt not in hir selfe so much pleasure, &amp; gaue great thanks vnto God for his exc&eacute;e|ding benefit which h&eacute;e had done vnto hir.</P>
<P>At that time the <HI>King Tiberio</HI> was in the Citie of <HI>Ratisbona,</HI> and the Qu&eacute;ene <HI>Augusta</HI> strayght wayes sent messengers, such as sh&eacute;e thought could well declare all that had happened, and by them she sent the <HI>Letter</HI> that the <HI>Em|perour</HI> had left written behinde him in the chamber of the <HI>Princesse,</HI> and the Qu&eacute;ene remained with hir owne <HI>Gentle|women,</HI> and with the <HI>Gentlewomen</HI> of the <HI>Princesse</HI> in the monestary of the <HI>Riuer:</HI> for that it was a place of great qui|etnesse &amp; pleasure, and sent all hir <HI>Knights</HI> and the rest of hir seruantes vnto the Citie, remayning onely with a fewe <HI>Knights</HI> for hir gard, &amp; other seruantes, such as were n&eacute;ede|full for hir seruice.</P>
<P>The messengers which went with the <HI>Embassage</HI> vnto the <HI>King Tiberio,</HI> came vnto the Court before him, at such time as the <HI>King</HI> was accompanied with all his high <HI>Prin|ces</HI> and <HI>Knights,</HI> amongest whome there was that excellent and worthie <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> carrying to heare when the departure of the <HI>Emperour</HI> and the <HI>Princesse</HI> should b&eacute;e declared in the Court. And when the messengers came b&eacute;efore they <HI>King</HI> the strayght wayes declared vnto him theyr Embassage, and gaue him the <HI>Emperours Letter,</HI> which at his commaundement was read openlye in the hearing of all the Court. And when they vnderstoode all
<PB N="10" REF="14" MS="y">
that this History hath told you, the great admiration that all people receyued, was wonderfull: &amp; when the <HI>King</HI> heard the contentes thereof, h&eacute;e remayned a great while as one being in a maze, and speake neuer a word. At last calling to his remembraunce the mightinesse of the <HI>Emperour,</HI> the great maiesty of his estate, the worthinesse of his person, &amp; the excellencie of his royall descent, h&eacute;e thought within him|self that <HI>God</HI> had done much for him, in giuing him so wor|thy &amp; mightie a sonne in law, and that his Daughter was the most happiest <HI>Princesse</HI> then liuing in the world, that in the end of all hir sorrow sh&eacute;e had found so noble &amp; excellent a husband. All this and many other things did greatly de|light his hart, but considering how much he was in charge for the <HI>Prince</HI> of great <HI>Britayne,</HI> h&eacute;e did not make any out|ward shew of his inward contentment, but demeaned him|selfe as one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> in thought, and very much trou|bled.</P>
<P>And after that he had a great while remayned in that traunce, without speaking anye thing, h&eacute;e sodainly arose vp from the place whereas h&eacute;e sate, and leauing all his <HI>Knights</HI> and <HI>Noble</HI> men in the great hall, h&eacute;e intered in|to his closet, and b&eacute;eing there alone, hee b&eacute;eganne again to call to his remembraunce the noble and mighty d&eacute;edes of the worthy <HI>Emperour Trebatio,</HI> and the more ioy and plea|sure he s&eacute;emed to receiue, giuing great thankes vnto <HI>God</HI> for that all thinges by the working of his mightie hand were brought to so good and ioyfull an ende. And thus all thinges well considered, h&eacute;e determined to make an out|ward shew of great anger agaynst the <HI>Emperour,</HI> till such time as he might vnderstand how the <HI>King Oliuerio</HI> did take the matter, at such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ime as h&eacute;e should heare newes thereof.</P>
<P>Likewise at that time came to his remembrance the mighty d&eacute;edes that the <HI>Emperour</HI> declared of the <HI>Knight of the Sun,</HI>
<PB REF="15">
musing with himselfe who that <HI>Knight</HI> should be that was of so great strength and power, and was very gladde and ioyfull that he had hin in his Court. And at this time all the nobles and <HI>Knights</HI> which remayned in the hall did talk one with another, and very much meruayled at the mighty deedes of the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> and all people did b&eacute;ehold him giuing him great prayse, and extol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ing him vnto the heauens, in such sort that he was ashamed to heare himself so praysed: But as it is a thing most common, that against prosperitie of the vertuous there doth not lacke malicious and enuions persons, who neuer resteth to procure the exe|cution of their venimous stomackes, it so fell out amongest the <HI>Knights</HI> that were there present, there was <HI>Florinaldus,</HI> h&eacute;e which the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> did ouerthrow at the bridge before <HI>Albamira,</HI> who for that he was a stout and gallaunt <HI>Knight,</HI> receyued great griefe that the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> should ouerthrow him, and especially b&eacute;efore his <HI>Lady</HI> and mistresse, and therefore h&eacute;e was very destrous to s&eacute;eke to haue opportunitie wherein he might b&eacute;e reuenged, &amp; make satisfaction of the shame and rebuke which he had receyued by him, many of those nobles and <HI>Knights</HI> that were present were his parents and kinsfolke. And I know not whe|ther it was with the great hope h&eacute;e hadde in his owne strength, or in the confidence of his kinsfolkes and friends, which were verye many, h&eacute;e determined with himselfe to s&eacute;eke some occasion of contention with the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne.</HI></P>
<P>Now at such time as these <HI>Knights</HI> were praysing him, and giuing him his deserued commendation, for the good h&eacute;e had done vnto the <HI>Emperour, Florinaldus</HI> replyed vnto them, and with a loude voyce, that he might be heard of all that were there present, h&eacute;e sayde. The <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> cannot in any wise excuse himselfe of a great offence, in that he did not aduertise my <HI>Lord,</HI> the King <HI>Tiberio,</HI> that the <HI>Emperour Trebatio</HI> would secretly car|rye awaye his Daughter contrarye vnto his will,

And for that he hath ben hetherto in his company, it is to be supposed that he was acquaynted with the <HI>Emperors</HI> deter|mination: and if it please my <HI>Lord</HI> the <HI>King</HI> to giue atten|cion vnto my words, he should commaund him for the same to b&eacute;e accordingly punished, for that in no place ther ought to be giuen any credite or trust to traycours, and therfore much lesse in the court of high and mighty <HI>Kings.</HI></P>
<P>When the Sonne of <HI>Trebatio</HI> heard these wordes, his coulour chaunged, and with very anger he gnashed his t&eacute;eth together, striuing to mittigate his cholarike ire by re|son, and to answere <HI>Florinaldus</HI> with patience, but yet this valiant <HI>Del Phoebo</HI> could not execute his vertuous desire, for that his wrath and cholar did much more surmount his calmnesse, which did proc&eacute;ede of his worthy &amp; vexed hart, in such sort that he could not find which way to compasse the same without the great abusing of his honour, especially to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">eare so infurious and vile words spoken against him, but with a surious and frowning countenaunce, which s&eacute;emed to terrifie all them that did behold him, he replied vnto <HI>Flori|naldus,</HI> and sayd: These words which thou hast spoken, <HI>Flori|naldus,</HI> be villanous, and not to be suffered. Therfore vpon the same if thou wilt goe forth into the field with m&eacute;e, I will giue th&eacute;e to vnderstand that thou doest lie falselie, for that I was neuer traitour to <HI>King</HI> nor to any other crea|ture. When this stout &amp; gallant <HI>Knight</HI> heard these words, his youthfull bloud being moued, being politike and nimble, with a trice he wrapped his cloake about his arme, &amp; drew out his sword, with the which he would haue striken the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> who was vnarmed: but giuing the enter|prise against the flower of all <HI>knights,</HI> before his sword could descend to execute his will, with a light leap more then thr&eacute;e paces he auoyded, &amp; drew out his sword (which was a hea|nie and sorrowfull drawing out vnto many.) And for that <HI>Florinaldus</HI> had there many kinsefolkes &amp; friends, and like|wise of his owne squires and seruants&punc; they altogether drew out their swords, some against the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> and
<PB REF="16">
other some to make peace betwixt them, so that there was not any in all the hall but hee hadde his sword readre drawen.</P>
<P>Now at such time as the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> would haue stro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">en his first blow at <HI>Florinaldus,</HI> a brother of his called the <HI>Troyan Earle,</HI> with his sword in his hand, put himselfe forwards, and thought to receiue the blow which descended, cutting the Ayer with great fury, &amp; lifting vp his sword&punc; (with pretence rather to hurt the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> then to make peace, his misfortune was such, that the blow descending with so great fury stroke the sword out of his hand, &amp; the sword of the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> lighted vpon his head, so that h&eacute;e claue it to the shoulders, and he fell downe dead vnto y^e ground, which was great griefe to <HI>Florinaldus,</HI> and vnto all the rest of his kinsfolkes &amp; friends, that dyd s&eacute;e him fall: who with great desire to reuenge the death of their kinseman, did put theyr liues in great daunger, with the perill that was before them. And procured all that euer they could to wound the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne.</HI> And being ma|ny and he vnarmed&punc; he found himselfe in the greatest dan|ger that euer in all his life he had b&eacute;ene in. Yet for all that in this desperate conflict, he did plainely show that he was the most couragious <HI>Knight</HI> of all his predecessours, and of all that followed after him. So that in all the twelue parts of this great historie as <HI>Trebatio,</HI> they haue no small cause to mencion this mighty <HI>Alfebo,</HI> more the~ any other <HI>Knight:</HI> for that this strong <HI>Knight</HI> dyd thinke nothing impossible vnto him that consisted in f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ates of armes, and where so e|uer he came, ther was nostrength nor courageable to make resistauns against his fury.</P>
<P>Now, when this couragious <HI>Gentleman</HI> dyd s&eacute;e him selfe inclosed with his enemies, and so many comming together to discharge and execute their fury vppon him, his wrath and courage increased in such sort, that in leaping forwardes and forwardes, striking about him on euery side, h&eacute;e chaunced on two of them which came
<PB N="12" REF="16" MS="y">
before him, being seruants vnto <HI>Florinaldus,</HI> so that with an ouerthwart blow he cut the one of them cleane a sunder by the middle, &amp; chaunced vpon the other in the same place, that his sword entred into his bowells, &amp; both of them fell dead to the ground. And not staying, he layd about him on euery side, so that no man dyd endure before him that was vnar|med, but hee ouerthrew him vnto the ground, and all that euer he dyd was little enough, for that with the great vio|lence and furie which they vsed without all feare, pressing vpon him in such sort, that they hurt him in thr&eacute;e or foure places, wher at their issued very much bloud.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding what with the great fory h&eacute;e had, and his exx&eacute;eding lightnesse and deadly blowes that hee stroke, hee made the most part of all them for great feare to put them selues apart from him. And hauing space that h&eacute;e could turne and winde his sworde about him, there was none that was so hardye for to assayle him, but that he cut him a sunder in the myddest.</P>
<P>There was at that time many nobles and <HI>Knights</HI> that would haue parted and made peace betwixt them, but the tumult was such and so farre out of order, that by no mea|nes they could reforme it, till such time as the <HI>King Tibe|rio heard</HI> that great rumour and noyse in the hall, he came forth out of his closet, and tooke his royall Septer in his hand, and pressed in amongst the thickest of them very fu|riously and with great anger. And when he came where as the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> was, and saw round about him so many dead persons, and amongst them the <HI>Troyan Earle,</HI> with great anger h&eacute;e layde hold on him and sayd, what is this O <HI>Knight,</HI> that in such order thou d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">st disqui|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">t my court, and hast slaine my <HI>Knights,</HI> so all the rest when they saw the <HI>King,</HI> they immediatly dyd retyre backe and were in quiet.</P>
<P>Then when the valyaunt <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> knew him to be the <HI>King,</HI> and heard what hee sayd, h&eacute;e forthwith dyd moderate his anger all that euer hee could, and sayde:
<PB REF="17">
it is your <HI>Knights</HI> that doth disquiet your <HI>Court</HI> and not I and if I haue slaine any it is in defending my self from the death, which they doe procure to giue me. Of this sayde the <HI>King</HI> I will informe my selfe, &amp; punish them that hath bene the occasion h&eacute;ereof. And in saying these words he demaun|ded of him his sword, which he gaue him, more for curtesies sake then for any other thing, &amp; hauing it, he also tooke the sword of <HI>Florinaldus,</HI> and of all the rest that he suspected to be on his partye, and straight wayes called beefore him all his <HI>Knights</HI> &amp; gard, &amp; commaunded them to take the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> prisoner, &amp; to carry him into a strong <HI>Tower</HI> which was on the one side of the <HI>Pallace,</HI> &amp; likewise to take <HI>Florinaldus,</HI> &amp; all those that were on his side, &amp; to carry them vnto another <HI>Tower</HI> that was on the other side of his <HI>Pal|lace,</HI> so that both the one &amp; the other were put in good k&eacute;e|ping, but if the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> had bene armed, before he would haue ben taken prisoner, he would haue made the <HI>King</HI> to haue giuen eare &amp; to hearke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> vnto that h&eacute;e would haue said in discharging himself, but by reason that he was as it were naked, he yeelded, and had patience with all that which the <HI>King</HI> commaunded, &amp; so they lead them vnto the <HI>Tower</HI> which was very high &amp; well walled. And when h&eacute;e was therin, they made fast a very great chaine to his leg, and for to k&eacute;epe him there was put thirty armed <HI>Knights,</HI> and as many mo other men. Then the <HI>Dutchesse</HI> of <HI>Pano|nia,</HI> did send vnto him a very good <HI>Surgion</HI> to heale him of his woundes. At this time the death of the <HI>Troyan Earle</HI> was published throughout all the Court, and there was made for him great lamentacion, for that the most noblest <HI>Princes</HI> and <HI>Knights</HI> that were there, were of his kins|folks. So both the one &amp; the other complayned very much vnto the <HI>King</HI> of the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> in such sort that h&eacute;e was verye much inflamed agaynst him. At this time there entered into the pallace the <HI>Countesse, Lady</HI> and wife vnto the <HI>Troyan Earle,</HI> in mourning appare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">l, bringing with hir two young sonnes, who entering into the Hall

whereas the King was, beeganne to powre foorth sorrowful complaynts, destring iustice agaynst them that had slayne hir Husband, and seeing him lye dead vppon the floore, shee threw hir selfe vpon him, and made such lamentation, that it was a heauie thing to b&eacute;ehold, at which sight if the King b&eacute;efore were inflamed against the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> his indignation dyd the more increase against him, in b&eacute;ehol|ding the great sorrow of the Countesse, and determyned in himselfe to doo iustice vpon the death of the Earle, and h&eacute;e ioyned vnto his indignation the great authoritie that h&eacute;e had to b&eacute;e called an executer of iustice, (which vnto manie, yea, &amp; very mightie <HI>Monarches</HI> oftentimes is very hurtfull, &amp; the ende of those extremities obtaine them the infamous names of Tyrants.) Then the King commaunded that the dead bodyes should bee carryed out of the hall and buryed, and the <HI>Troyan</HI> Earle was buryed with great honour, and accompanyed with the most noble and principall <HI>Knights</HI> of the Court. Now, hee b&eacute;eing very sorrowfull for the death of the Earle, many <HI>Knights</HI> that had affection vnto the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> dyd labour with him for his discharge, of b&eacute;eing in any fault of that tumult, and dyd informe him of the great cause that he had to do that which he did in his owne defence, but there was nothing that dyd profit at all with the King, but rather h&eacute;e dyd shew himselfe very angry and wrathfull against them that dyd speake vnto him in the <HI>Knights</HI> b&eacute;ehalfe, which was a great griefe vnto many which dyd know the valure and desert of the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> for it s&eacute;emed vnto them no reason that h&eacute;e should b&eacute;e intreated in that sort. And b&eacute;ecause that the King <HI>Tibe|rio</HI> was daylie and hourely vrged on all parts, the one cry|ing and asking iustice, and the other gayne-saying the same, h&eacute;e was for certaine daies very doubtfull, not know|ing how co determine what was best to bee done, but aun|swered them all to their little delyght. By this tyme the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">night of the Sunne was healed of his wounds, and the Dutchesse of <HI>Panonia</HI> prouided for him all things necessa|rie in the prison, performing it with as great care and di|ligence

<HEAD>How the Knight of Cupido dyd take his leaue of the Queene Arguirosa, and entred into the kingdome of Rusia, where he found a strange aduenture. Chap. 4.</HEAD>
<P>_THE mightie d&eacute;edes of the <HI>Emperour Tre|batio,</HI> and the worthy knighthood of the va|liant <HI>Alphebo,</HI> hath put almost in obliui|on that excellent and worthy <HI>Knight Rosi|cleer,</HI> whose amorous loue, and inuincible deedes, doo deserue a more eloquenter wri|ter then my vnskilfull pen can performe. Now if you doo remember in the Historie past, how that one way Fortune caused him to be the most saddest and sorrowful <HI>Knight</HI> that euer was seene, so full of bitter heauinesse, that whatsoeuer thing h&eacute;e dyd accomplish and bring to passe was not suffi|cient to make him merry. And on the other side, Fortune dyd show him very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> in putting beefore him mar|ueilous and wonderfull things and aduentures of so great strangenesse, that ouer comming them by his surmounted valo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">r, in all the world was spred a broad the fame of the <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Cupido.</HI> So after that h&eacute;e had slaine that valyant <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> from all the parts of <HI>Thesalia,</HI> and the confines round about, there came many people for to s&eacute;e him, as a thing of great admiration, in the time that h&eacute;e there remai|n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">d, for to place the Queene <HI>Arguirosa</HI> in full possession of all hir landes, and that all hir vasalls and subiectes were

quieted and setled in good order. For by reason that he was on the Qu&eacute;enes side, in few dayes they were all in peace and quyet.</P>
<P>Now when h&eacute;e saw that there was no more to b&eacute;e done, h&eacute;e was very desirous to go vnto some other place, wheras in recompence of the great honour and seruice done vnto him, hee might bee in some solytarie desart, to b&eacute;ewayle his mis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ortune. Then remembring himselfe, hee determined to take his leaue of the Queene <HI>Arguirosa,</HI> who bare him great good will, and dyd loue him as hir selfe. And if sh&eacute;e had not perceiued that his heart was prisoner in some other place, sh&eacute;e would with a verie good will haue chosen him Lord of hirs, and receiued him for hir husband, without any desire to b&eacute;e informed farther of his estate and discent: for she re|sted wholely satisfied in that which shee saw by experience of his royall worthinesse and bountie.</P>
<P>And when the <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Cupido</HI> dyd declare vnto hir his desire to depart, and craued licence for the same, she re|ceiued so great sorrow therat, that in a long space she could not make him any aunswere. So after a whyle that sh&eacute;e had remained in that traunce, distilling from hir christaline eyes abundaunce of teares which ran downe vpon hir faire and lyllie white ch&eacute;ekes, lyke vnto orientall pearles: sh&eacute;e vttered vnto him these words.</P>
<P>Worthie <HI>Knight,</HI> this thy departure which thou dost pre|tend, is vnto mee so great a griefe, that I hartely wish I had not knowen you, although it had cost m&eacute;e a great part of this my Kingdome.

happiest Gentlewoman in all the world, but s&eacute;eing it is so that another hath possessed that place before m&eacute;e, and deser|ued to bee Lady of your libertie: this one thing I doo desire of thee, that wheresoeuer you become to remember m&eacute;e, and this my Countrie and Kingdome, the which you may take as your owne at all tymes when occasion shall serue, for that there cannot b&eacute;e a greater pleasure vnto m&eacute;e, then for you to commaund m&eacute;e in any thing that is requisit. And if at any tyme Fortune bring you into this countrie, with more delight then at this time you s&eacute;eme to be indued with all, I shall thinck my selfe most happie, that as I haue r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">|ceiued at your hands this kingdome, so I may lykewise ob|taine a husband at your appoyntment, for receiuing him at the hands of so worthy a <HI>Knight,</HI> it cannot be but very con|formable vnto my honour, and conuenient for my estate.</Q></P>
<P>All this the Qu&eacute;ene spake, for the great loue sh&eacute;e bare vn|to <HI>Rosicleer,</HI> giuing him honestly to vnderstand that if it were his pleasure to receiue hir for his wife, sh&eacute;e was very wel content therwith, but <HI>Rosicleere</HI> who had his thoughts very far from hir purpose, would not aunswere any thing wherby sh&eacute;e might take any hold, yet gaue hir great thanks for hir curteous proffer made vnto him, and promi|sed hir alwayes to haue hir in remembrance, and to serue hir in all that euer h&eacute;e could. And although at that time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e dyd excuse himselfe as much as hee might to cl&eacute;ere himselfe of that charge, in prouiding hir a Husband of his owne choyce, yet time did serue that <HI>Rosicleer</HI> had opportunitie, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> dyd est&eacute;eme it very much, &amp; h&eacute;e dyd pacifie very great and troublesome controuersies, hatreds, and discords, by which sh&eacute;e might haue receiued great damage &amp; harme, as in this History shall b&eacute;e shewed vnto you. So in the ende of many curtesies b&eacute;etw&eacute;ene them, <HI>Rosicleer</HI> tooke his leaue of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> Qu&eacute;ene, and would receiue nothing of hir but onely a good horse, which she commanded to b&eacute;e giuen him, &amp; so h&eacute;e depar|ted out of the Citie, and in few dayes after out of the king|dome, and in passing through <HI>Dardania</HI> and <HI>Dacia,</HI> h&eacute;e tra|uayled many dayes, in the which there chaunced sundry
<PB N="15" REF="19" MS="y">
aduentures that I omit, to come vnto the effect of this hi|storie. And b&eacute;eing foorth of the Realme of <HI>Dacia,</HI> the history sayth that h&eacute;e entered into the kingdome of <HI>Russia,</HI> wheras it was told him there were great and meruaylous aduen|tures. So it happened that the third day in the morning he entered into that Countrie, and came vnto a plaine moun|taine, so fresh and delectable as might be pos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ible, and he tra|uayled so long therein, till at the last his way dyd part in twaine, &amp; the one way was more vsed then the other, and by reason that his minde was troubled in thincking vppon his Lady the Princesse <HI>Oliuia,</HI> h&eacute;e was so far from his re|membrance, that h&eacute;e respected not which way h&eacute;e tooke, but followed that way which his horse voluntarily went, who entered into that which was lesse vsed, &amp; h&eacute;e trauailed for|wards in that way the most part of all that day, and b&eacute;e|ing tormented with his loue, he remembred not to eate, nei|ther had h&eacute;e mynde of any other thing, til such tyme as his horse for very hunger stayed and would goe no farther, but striued to eate of the gr&eacute;ene grasse which was in the way. And by this occasion the <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Cupide</HI> came vnto him|selfe, and saw that hee had lost his way, and was entered into that path, and considering the most part of the day was already past, hee quickened vp his spirits, and trauay|led with better remembrance then b&eacute;efore h&eacute;e had done, ma|king great hast to come vnto some place, where h&eacute;e might haue somwhat to eate, and not suffer himselfe to dye despe|rately with hunger. So h&eacute;e followed that euill accustomed way till such time as it was almost night, and it brought him vnto the sight of very high and mightie <HI>Rocks,</HI> which were in the middest of that wildernesse, vnder the which he saw a thing that dyd put him in great admiration which was, that out of the mouth of a caue vnder those <HI>Rocks</HI> there came foorth great flames of fyer, accompanied with darke and thick smoake, which seemed to b&eacute;e some infernall den, the mouth of the Caue was so great, that a <HI>Knight</HI> on Horsebacke myght well enter in thereat: and b&eacute;eing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">|rous to know what it should b&eacute;e, h&eacute;e drew nigh vnto it, but
<PB REF="20">
his horse was so fearefull, that h&eacute;e could not come so nigh as the <HI>Knights</HI> will was, but was constrayned to alight from his back, and made him fast vnto a tr&eacute;e, and he went a foot towards that wonderfull caue. When h&eacute;e came nigh vnto it, h&eacute;e saw towards the right hand ingrauen in the hard <HI>Rock</HI> certaine <HI>Letters</HI> very fayre, which s&eacute;emed to b&eacute;e of great antiquity, and h&eacute;e read them, finding them to be as followeth.</P>
<P><Q>This is the caue of the wise <HI>Artidon,</HI> who dyed for the loue of <HI>Artidea,</HI> daughter vnto king <HI>Liberio,</HI> the onely heyre of this Kingdome, who in recompence of hir cruelty doth and shall remaine h&eacute;ere, giuing true aunsweres vnto all that shall b&eacute;e demaunded of hir, till such tyme as a <HI>Knight</HI> shall come, who with his great bounty and force can ouer|come the terrible k&eacute;epers of the entrie h&eacute;ereof, and set hir at lybertie, and then shall this entrie b&eacute;e fr&eacute;e vnto all those that will know any thing of the wyse man.</Q></P>
<P>When the <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Cupide</HI> had well read these <HI>Letters</HI> and vnderstood them, h&eacute;e very much meruayled at that straunge aduenture, and strayght way it mooued in him a great good will and desire to prooue the same, both to s&eacute;e and know what was within the caue, and euen as one that dyd abhor his owne lyfe, so h&eacute;e delyghted not in any other thing but in great and perillous aduentures, &amp; indeuoured to giue the attempt vnto them when h&eacute;e had opportunitie, but by reason it was late, and that it waxed dark, he deter|mined to let the enterprise alone till the next morning, for that the night might be a hinderance vnto him for the per|formance. And therewith h&eacute;e pulled off his Horse Bridle, to let him f&eacute;ede vpon the grasse there abouts, and he as one that had no care of himselfe, layde him a long vpon the gr&eacute;ene grasse, and then his minde b&eacute;egan a new to b&eacute;e trou|bled with his accustomed thoughts, not remembring that in all the day b&eacute;efore h&eacute;e had not eaten any thing, neyther dyd he know where to get any meat to refresh himselfe at that tyme of the nyght, and calling to his remembraunce the cruell words in the <HI>Letter</HI> of the Princesse <HI>Oliuia,</HI> his
<PB N="16" REF="20" MS="y">
heart suffered so great gr&eacute;ese and passions, that tumbling himselfe vpon the grasse from the one side to the other, hee sayde: Oh earth, that for all mortalytie thou openest thy selfe, and receiuest them into thy bosome, wherefore doost not thou now at this present open thy bowells and receiue m&eacute;e into th&eacute;e, for b&eacute;eing buried, I should receiue great con|tentment. I know not wherefore I lyue any longer, or wherefore I am suffered in this world, for that I haue lost all hope to s&eacute;e any more the <HI>Princesse Oliuia.</HI> Oh that this aduenture which I meane to prooue might b&eacute;e the last, and that I might dye h&eacute;ere within this caue, although the occa|sion of my death b&eacute;e neuer knowen nor heard of. So these and many other words of great lamentation h&eacute;e vttered, that it was most gr&eacute;euous to heare, and passed away a p&eacute;ece of the first part of the night with great sorrow. And the nyght b&eacute;eing very darke, vppon a sodayne h&eacute;e heard a noise and murmuring of people, which caused him to aryse vp to s&eacute;e what it should b&eacute;e, and h&eacute;e saw at the foote of the <HI>Rock</HI> a great fire, and round about the same there were a company of Shepheards, and those were they which made that noyse. And b&eacute;eing desirous to know what they could say more of that caue, h&eacute;e determined to goe whereas they were, and when h&eacute;e came vnto them, h&eacute;e saluted them with very curteous words. When the Shepheards saw him of so goodly a stature, and armed with so precious and rych armour, they receiued him as a <HI>Knight</HI> of estimation, and gaue him very good intertainment, and dyd inuite him to theyr supper, which they had in a readinesse, and after that h&eacute;e had surrendered vnto them thankes for theyr courtesie, h&eacute;e sat downe amongst them by the sier.</P>
<P>Then one of the shepheards, who s&eacute;emed to be the ch&eacute;efe a|mong them, and that had more vnderstanding, and was of a better conuersation then all y^e rest, did demand of the <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Cupide,</HI> what aduenture had brought him at that tyme of the night to that place? The <HI>Knight</HI> aunswered and sayde. I am a straunger in this Countrie, and now it is three dayes since I first entered into this Kingdome,
<PB REF="21">
and for that I dyd not know nor yet doo, this countrie, my fortune hath brought mee hether this euening, and s&eacute;eing that the night drew on, fearing to b&eacute;e intangled in vnaccu|stomed wayes, I determined to remaine there hard by the Court till the morning, pretending to prooue that aduen|ture when the day was come. And afterward when I saw you together h&eacute;ere, I thought it best to come into your co~|pany, as well to eate somewhat (for that I am very hun|grie) as also to informe my selfe of you touching the aduen|ture of this caue of <HI>Artidon,</HI> for till this euening that I did come hether and s&eacute;e it, I neuer b&eacute;efore heard any mention therof. Then the shepheards sayd, sir <HI>Knight,</HI> s&eacute;eing that you haue given vs to vnderstand the occasion of your comming hether, wee will now giue you to vnderstand what w&eacute;e know, and what at any time we could learne of the aduen|ture of this cause, &amp; possiblie after you vnderstand it, it will withdraw you from this great good will and determinaty|on that you haue, to giue the proofe and enterprise. And in the meane time that which w&eacute;e haue for our supper shall be made ready, &amp; of such as w&eacute;e haue with a very good will you shall eate your part, for that your person and presence doth deserue no lesse.</P>
<P><Q>Now, that which w&eacute;e doo know and of long time past haue heard say touching this Caue, is, that in time past almost out of memorie, there was in this Kingdome of <HI>Russia</HI> a <HI>Knight</HI> called <HI>Artidon,</HI> who being a <HI>Knight</HI> of great courage and high lynage, and gentle of disposition, was also the wy|sest in the magicall art that could b&eacute;e found in many coun|tries. And in the chiefest time and flower of all his Knight|hood and science, this Kingdome was gouerned by a Ladie called <HI>Artedea,</HI> who at the death of the King hir father was very yong, but when sh&eacute;e came vnto the state of marryage, th&eacute;e was so fayre and of so great beautie, that many <HI>Princes</HI> and <HI>Knights</HI> desired to haue hir for wife, but among all those that in their seruice dyd most indeuour to obtaine hir loue, there was not one of them that in so noble and valyaunt manner did demeane himselfe as <HI>Artedon</HI> dyd, for not alone
<PB N="17" REF="21" MS="y">
in d&eacute;edes of armes, but also by his science, he dyd mighty &amp; wonderfull things in hir seruice. But his fate &amp; misfortune was such, that the qu&eacute;ene did not onely withdraw hir loue from him, but did also hate &amp; abhorre him to the death: &amp; all that euer he did in hir seruice did moue hir to be melancho|like &amp; very angry. This worthy <HI>Artidon</HI> had his loue so in|tirely fixed vpun hir, that he would doe any thing for hir de|light, but all that he dyd was not est&eacute;emed of the Qu&eacute;ene, which was the occasion that after he was fully certified &amp; vnderstoode hir great crueltie, h&eacute;e sell into a mortall sicke|nesse, &amp; being without all hope of remedy of the Qu&eacute;ene, h&eacute;e determined to reuenge himself on hir before he dyed. So on a night by his great learning, he tooke the Qu&eacute;ene out of hir bed &amp; brought hir vnto his caue: &amp; that night there was thundring &amp; lightning, that with the great noise therof, they thought verely the whole world would haue sonke. But in the morning when they saw that the Quane was gone, &amp; could not finde hir, they sought for hir in all parts, but all was in vayne, for that chauncing to come this way, &amp; rea|ding that which is there grauen in the Rocke, they straight wayes vnderstoode that the wise <HI>Artidon</HI> had brought hir thether, in reuenge of the great cruelty that she vsed to him. Whervpon ther was diuers <HI>Knights</HI> that would proue the entrie into the caue, and it fell out with them as you shall beare. All such <HI>Knights</HI> as were in loue dyd enter in tho|rough the fier, without receyuing any hurt, but within a while after they were put back &amp; throwen out againe some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">arke dead, and other some very sore hurt and ill intrea|ted. And when it was demaunded of them what they saw within the caue, and what happened vnto them, they sayde <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">hat at the entry thereof ther was a great Bull, which dyd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">efend the entry, and at the first encounter he stroke them with his hornes, and dorue them out of the caue, and this Bull was of so great and wonderfull bignesse and fierce|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">esse that the like hath not b&eacute;ene s&eacute;ene, &amp; his hornes were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> so great hardnesse that they s&eacute;emed to be st&eacute;ele, &amp; all such

And in saying these words h&eacute;e went from that place, and on the other side hee saw a great &amp; broad payre of stayres, very wel wrought, which went vp vnto the gallaries, and it s&eacute;emed to bee the way which hee should take, wherefore h&eacute;e ascended vp the stayres, and when hee came into the galleries hee saw that they were very broade, and well wrought with straunge worke, &amp; thr&eacute;e of those galleries were on that side the court whereas h&eacute;e had the contention with the monsters, and on the other side toward a very fayre Orcharde, fresh and de|lectable, full of all sort of gr&eacute;ene tr&eacute;es and sweet flowers, whereas hee heard a meruailous sweet harmony of many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">yrdes, which were in that Orchard, and on the other side of the Gallerie was there meruaylous great and straunge buyldinges, and in the same Gallerie there was a doore open for to enter into that worke, so the <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Cupide</HI> entered in, and came into a Qua|dran: which appeared very cleere, bryght, and fayre,
<PB REF="27">
and on the one side thereof there was a doore, which s&eacute;emed to be shut on the inside, who had to keepe and gard the same a mighty great and dreadfull <HI>Gyant,</HI> with an yron Mase in his hand, who as soone as hee saw the <HI>Knight,</HI> with both his hands lift vp his Mase aboue his head, and dyd abide till such time as the <HI>Knight</HI> should come vnto him, with so ter|rible countenaunce, that any man would haue thought it great solly to haue a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">utted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">im, and ouer the doore was written <HI>Letters</HI> to this effect.</P>
<P><Q>When this doore shall b&eacute;e open, then shall the Qu&eacute;ene <HI>Artidea</HI> b&eacute;e at lybertie, and the entrie heerein shall bee free vnto all people.</Q></P>
<P>And when he had read it, he thought within himselfe&punc; that for to make an ende of that aduenture, h&eacute;e must n&eacute;edes haue battayle with the <HI>Gyaunt.</HI> And so without any more tarry|ing, with his sword in his hand hee went towards him. When the <HI>Gyaunt</HI> saw him nigh, h&eacute;e discharged from a lost his great and mightie Mase, thinking to strike the <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Cupide</HI> on the head, but h&eacute;e who alwaies had in remem|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e what was best for him to dooe, with a meruailous great lyghtnesse leapt on the one side&punc; in such sort, that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">eat yron mase fell downe vpon the floore, and with the fu|ry wherwith it was stroke, it made all the pallace to shake: this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ghtie blow was not so soone giuen, when that the worthie <HI>Knight</HI> threw a some at him&punc; and stroke him on the breast, and according vnto the great strength wherwith it was giuen, it had beene sufficient to haue passed through the <HI>Gyants</HI> body, although h&eacute;e was armed with strong yron, but his armour was made by such art, that it made the point of his sword to double and bow vnto the hilts, and made no signe therof in his armour. Then the <HI>Gyant</HI> lift vp his mase againe to strike him another blow but this valiant <HI>Knight</HI> s&eacute;eing the smal harme that he could doo him with his sword, determyned to assault him by some other meanes, and see|ing that the <HI>Gyant</HI> dyd discharge his blow&punc; h&eacute;e entered in so|close with him, that h&eacute;e was constrayned to fall downe on both his knees for to cl&eacute;ere himselfe from the fury thereof,

and rising vp againe with great lightnesse, finding him|selfe nigh the <HI>Gyaunt,</HI> h&eacute;e threw his sword from him, and with both his handes layde fast holde in the middest of the <HI>Gyaunts</HI> Mase, and pulled at it with so great strength, that h&eacute;e pulled it out of his hands, and was very ioyfull for the winning thereof. But as soone as the <HI>Gyaunt</HI> had lost his mase, vpon a sodaine h&eacute;e vanished away that hee was neuer more s&eacute;ene, and the <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Cupide</HI> remayned all alone very much meruailing at such sodaine and straunge things as hee saw there, and when he perceiued that there was no more to doo but to open the doore, hee went to it and prooued to open it, but h&eacute;e could not mooue it neither on the one part nor on the other, although h&eacute;e put great strength to open the same, &amp; s&eacute;eing that he colde not profit with his strength, h&eacute;e tooke the <HI>Gyants</HI> Mase in his hands and sayd: It dooth come all to one purpose to breake thee by force, as to open th&eacute;e by policie or art, &amp; therewith hee stroke a mightie blow in the middest of the doore, that hee brok it all to small p&eacute;e|ces, and vpon a soda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ne at the same time h&eacute;e heard a great and terrible noyse of Thunder, that the heauens s&eacute;emed to open therewith, and in all the Kingdome of <HI>Russia</HI> was heard that terrible noise, which caused all men to feare and wonder, for that the day was very fayre and cl&eacute;ere, &amp; could not imagine what should bee the occasion to mooue any such thing in the Region of the Ayre, and after that this great Thundering and noise was past, the <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Cupide</HI> saw that the entrie in at the doore was cl&eacute;ere, and without any impediments, so h&eacute;e entered in thereat and came into ano|ther Quadran, which was meruailous bright &amp; cleere&punc; onely by the vertue of precyous stones which were very big, set round about the wals, and in the middest of this Quadran, there was in manner of a stage, very straungel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e wrought and round about it steps like stayres for to go vp vpon, and vpon the same stage there was set in a chayre very richlie wrought, the Queene <HI>Artidea</HI> who was very fayre &amp; roy|ally apparayled, who le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ned hir head vpon hir arme, and there was beeholding a <HI>Knight</HI> of a very good countenance

This <HI>Knight</HI> was the wyse <HI>Artidon,</HI> who willingly and with his owne handes dyd wound and open his breast, after that h&eacute;e had brought the Queene thether, at the houre that the <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Cupide</HI> entered into that Quadran and saw all this, the same houre was the inchauntment vndone, and the Queene was at lybertie, who when sh&eacute;e lyft vp hir eyes and saw him, sh&eacute;e straight waies vnderstood that that <HI>Knight</HI> had fi|nished that aduenture, and set hir at libertie, for the which b&eacute;eing ioyfull, sh&eacute;e arose from the place where sh&eacute;e was set, and when the <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Cupide</HI> saw hir aryse, h&eacute;e went towardes h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">. and dyd salute hir very curteously, and sh&eacute;e spake vnto him saying: O gentle <HI>Knight,</HI> wherewith can I gratifie you for this great benefit which by your mightie bountie and prowesse this day I haue receiued, in that I am at liberty and cl&eacute;ere of this heauy and sorrowfull prison, in the which I haue b&eacute;en so many y&eacute;eres, dooing no other thing but liue in continuall sorrow and lamentation for the death of this <HI>Knight.</HI> Tell me I pray th&eacute;e who thou art, and in what estate doth all my Kingdome remaine, for that I b&eacute;e|leeue, by reason of the long tyme that I haue b&eacute;ene h&eacute;ere, there is no memorie nor mencion of m&eacute;e.</P>
<P>Then the <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Cupid</HI> said, Lady, vnto god thou ough|test to surrender these thancks, and not to mee, for that h&eacute;e hath beene the principal dooer, and h&eacute;e it is that hath deliue|red thee out of this <HI>Inchantment,</HI> and that which I of my part haue done, it is sufficient satisfaction, for y^t I haue done it in the seruice of such a person as you are.

<P>The Qu&eacute;ene was very glad and dyd reioyce to heare those words. And when sh&eacute;e saw the excellent beauty of the <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Cupid,</HI> who had the beauer of his healme lift vp, sh&eacute;e was greatly amazed thereat, and thought within hir selfe that she could not make him better satisfaction for that which h&eacute;e had done for hir, then to take him for hir husband. And thincking the tyme long to s&eacute;e hir selfe cl&eacute;ere out of that place&punc; sh&eacute;e sayde, that if h&eacute;e were desirous to know the truth of any thing of the wyse <HI>Artidon,</HI> that h&eacute;e which was kneeling on his kn&eacute;es vppon the Scaffolde was the same, and that h&eacute;e would giue him the true and perfect aunswere of all things that should b&eacute;e demaunded of him. The <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Cupide</HI> who was very glad thereof, went vnto the wyse <HI>Artidon,</HI> and sayd.</P>
<P>O gentle <HI>Knight</HI> and wyse <HI>Artidon,</HI> let now thy misfor|tune giue comfort vnto my sorrow, which thou doost know is very great, and how that it should bee vnto m&eacute;e a glory|ous death, that in opening of my breast, and shewing my heart vnto that cruell Lady, I might cause hir to w&eacute;epe, and it were but one teare of pittie to haue compassyon of m&eacute;e.</P>
<P>Lykewyse thou doost well know the great misfortune of the <HI>Princesse Briana</HI> my Mother, and how the <HI>Prince Eeward</HI> my Father and my Lord. hir spowse was lost, and w&eacute;e could neuer heare any newes of him, and also my brother the Gentleman of the Sunne was lost b&eacute;eing but an infant, and neuer yet could newes b&eacute;e heard of him, now heere I besire th&eacute;e that thou dost giue me some newes of them, or to tell m&eacute;e whether they b&eacute;e alyue or dead,
<PB REF="29">
or whether I shall goe to s&eacute;eke them, for that whatsoeuer thou shalt tell mee, I shall hold it for a truth, and when thou hast satisfied mee of the truth heerof, then I will desire th&eacute;e to tell mee some newes of that which passeth in the court of King <HI>Oliuerio,</HI> and as for the <HI>Princesse Oliuia</HI> my mistresse, I know well that I doo not deserue to know any thing of hir. And when hee had made an end of saying these words, straight wayes the wyse man dyd open his eyes, &amp; dyd looke vpon the <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Cupide,</HI> and when h&eacute;e had wel beholden him, h&eacute;e answered and sayde: Worthie <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Cupide,</HI> thou oughtest to haue thy selfe in great estimation, for that thou hast finished and made an ende of this aduenture, the which many could not haue done, although they were both mightie and worthie <HI>Knights</HI> that haue come hether, and giuen the enterprise of the same, although they haue done other wonderfull and great d&eacute;edes of armes, for the great compassion which thou hast hadde of my death I giue th&eacute;e thanks therefore, and in reward of the same I will tel th&eacute;e straunge and secret things, which shall giue th&eacute;e great con|tentment, touching that which thou hast demanded of m&eacute;e of the Prince <HI>Edward,</HI> &amp; of thy brother. And in saying these wordes h&eacute;e tolde him perticularly all the whole Historie of the great <HI>Emperour Trebatio,</HI> from the first time that he was in loue with the <HI>Princesse Briana,</HI> till such time as h&eacute;e went out of the Castle of <HI>Lindaraza,</HI> by the high prowesse of the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> &amp; how he went in his company into <HI>Hungaria,</HI> and how hee carryed the <HI>Princesse</HI> into his Em|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">re of <HI>Grecia.</HI> So likewise h&eacute;e tolde him how that mightie and valiaunt <HI>Knight</HI> who tooke the <HI>Emperour Trebatio</HI> his Father out of the inchanted Castell, was the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> of whom h&eacute;e was succoured, b&eacute;eing at the poynt of death in the Iland of <HI>Candramarte,</HI> and how it was that <HI>Gentleman</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> his brother, who beeing a yong in|tant was lost at the <HI>Monestarie</HI> of the Riuer, who at this present is a Pagan and dooth lyue in the law of the Gen|tiles, for that h&eacute;e hath b&eacute;ene brought vp amongst Pagans, and dooth not know whose sonne h&eacute;e is, although hee hath

ben in <HI>Hungaria,</HI> in the court of his grandfather, the <HI>King Tiberio&punc;</HI> &amp; hath done so high &amp; mighty deeds of <HI>Knighthood,</HI> as euer hath ben seene or heard of. When the <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Cu|pid</HI> heard al this, he receyued very great content &amp; was very glad that the long &amp; heauy sorrow of the <HI>Princesse</HI> his mo|ther was remedyed, the which did giue hir <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ally no small sorrow &amp; griefe. And being in this delight the wise man pro|c&eacute;eded forwards in his talke and sayd.</P>
<P>Touching the newes that thou do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">st aske of me of the <HI>Court</HI> of the <HI>King Oliuerio,</HI> I giue thee to vnderstand that all which at this present they doe intreat of there, is, that y^e <HI>Prince of Lusitania</HI> is very much in loue with the <HI>Princesse Oliuia,</HI> and hath demaunded hir of the <HI>King</HI> hir <HI>Father</HI> for spouse, &amp; the <HI>King</HI> hath promised him the graunt therof, and what shall happen therof I cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ell, neyther what the <HI>Princesse Oliuia</HI> doth pretend therin, for that to me there is not graunted so much liberty as to discouer or declare the secrets of harts, neyther of that which hath passed at this present. And now pardon me for that I cannot aunswere th&eacute;e vnto any other thing whatsoeuer thou wilt demaund of me. And in saying these words the wise <HI>Artidon</HI> did close vp his eyes, &amp; remayned dead as before.</P>
<P>But when the <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Cupid</HI> vnderstood what h&eacute;e sayde touching the <HI>Princesse Oliuia,</HI> his bloud wared cold in his bo|dy, &amp; all the pleasure which before he receiued, was now tur|ned into heauinesse, &amp; hauing no power to dissemble any lon|ger, he cast vp his eyes vnto the heauens and vttered words of great lamentation, and with so terrible sighinges and complayntes, that the Qu&eacute;ene <HI>Artidea,</HI> who was behol|ding him, hadde great compassion of his sorrow. And beeing in this griefe, h&eacute;e heard a great noyse of people which were comming vp the stayres into the Gallerye: And looking what it should b&eacute;e, h&eacute;e saw the Shepheards that remayned without the caue abiding his successe, who when they perceyued that hee tarried so long, and came <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">r soorth, and agayne hearing the great noyse of the bat|tayle
<PB REF="30">
of the <HI>Bull,</HI> as also when the <HI>Dragon</HI> was ingendered, they were greatly amazed, whervpon two of them went to carry these newes vnto the <HI>Prince Luziro,</HI> who was in a citie but a mile from that place. And in the meane time that these two Shepheards were declaring vnto the <HI>Prince</HI> all that they heard, after that the <HI>Knight</HI> had entred into the caue, at that instant was heard that great &amp; terrible <HI>thun|dering</HI> which was made when the <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Cupid</HI> brake the doore of the inchaunted <HI>Quadran,</HI> with the yron male of the <HI>Giant,</HI> at which time the Qu&eacute;ene was set at liberty, which when the <HI>Prince</HI> &amp; all his <HI>Knights</HI> heard that terri|ble &amp; wonderfull noyse, they all suspected that that <HI>Knight</HI> had broke vp &amp; vndone that <HI>Inchauntment</HI> and straunge ad|uenture of the caue, for that it was told him by many wise men, that in his time the Qu&eacute;ene should be discharged &amp; set at liberty. So strayght way the <HI>Prince</HI> tooke his horse, &amp; be|ing accompanyed with many noble <HI>Knights</HI> he came vnto the ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e, and when he came thether he saw that the letters that were wont to be there were altered, &amp; other letters conteyning these words in their place.</P>
<P><Q>This aduenture was finished by the <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Cupid,</HI> who did set at liberty the Qu&eacute;ene <HI>Artidea,</HI> and in remem|braunce therof ther doth remaine within the wise <HI>Artidon,</HI> of whom all those that are touched with amorous passions, may passe the flames of fire without any impediment, and know of him all that euer they will aske.</Q></P>
<P>When the Prince and all those that came with him had read that writing, they were meruaylous glad and ioy|ful, and thought long to see the Queene, and the <HI>Knight</HI> that had set hir at liberty. And without any more tarrying they entered in through the flames of fire, and for that the most part of them were young men &amp; louers, they passed in quiet without any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> of the fire, and went forwardes on till they came into the court, &amp; there they did all of them behold the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ll, wheron was portrayed the <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Cu|pid,</HI> making his battayles with the <HI>Bull, Dragon,</HI> &amp; <HI>Gyant,</HI>

which was wonderfull to be s&eacute;ene, as well for the flercenes and straungenes of the battailes, as for the great subt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">itye and art that was in the setting forth of the story vpon the wall. After that they had well perused the same, they went forwards vp the stayres and came into the galleries. This was the noyse that the queene &amp; the <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Cupid</HI> heard, &amp; tarrying to s&eacute;e what it should be, the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Luziro,</HI> ac|companied with all his <HI>Knights</HI> entered into the quadran, &amp; when they saw the queene, whom the <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Cupid</HI> had by the hand they were greatly amazed to see hir so faire &amp; beautifull, &amp; when they came vnto hir, they asked hir hands to kisse them, &amp; told hir who they were. When the Queene vnderstood he was the <HI>Prince Luziro,</HI> who was gouernour of the realme in hir absence, she was very glad and ioyfull, and intertayned him with a very good grace, and asked of him how he did know that the aduenture was furnished, be|cause he came so quicklie thether. And then he told vnto hir what the shepheards had declared to him, and of the great noise of thunder which they heard, he affirmed that to be the occasion that they came thether so soone, and after that the <HI>Prince</HI> had talked with the queene, he turned vnto the <HI>Knight</HI> and did imbrace him, receiuing him with wordes of great curtesie &amp; friendship, who was like wise greatly astonied at his mightie &amp; faire countenaunce, which was agr&eacute;eable vn|to his great curtesie &amp; courage&punc; shewed in that aduenture, &amp; being very desirous to know who y^t stout &amp; valiant <HI>Knight</HI> should be, they requested the queene to demaund it of him, &amp; for that the Qu&eacute;ene heard that which the wise <HI>Artidon</HI> had said vnto him, she strayght waies declared that he was the <HI>Emperours</HI> son of <HI>Greece,</HI> &amp; wondering very much thereat, they could not but looke &amp; behold him with great affection.</P>
<P>So after that among them ther had, passed many cur|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ous wordes, the <HI>Prince Luziro</HI> and all the rest that came with him, dyd indeauour themselues to b&eacute;eholde the straunge thinges of that inchaunted <HI>Quadran.</HI> And when they saw the wise. <HI>Artidon</HI> with his breast open
<PB REF="31">
in such sort that they might discouer his hart, they wer mo|ued &amp; had great compassion on him, &amp; did very much extoll &amp; prayse his wisdome &amp; bounty, in that he would rather dye then profite himselfe of the Qu&eacute;ene agaynst hyr will. And when they had viewed all things that was to b&eacute;e s&eacute;ene, they went forth of that inchaunted <HI>Quadran,</HI> &amp; descended into the fayre &amp; broad court, &amp; returned a new and beheld that time|rous battayle which was ther figured, &amp; would not bel&eacute;eue that in any humane <HI>Knight</HI> there should be so much force &amp; strength, as was shewed to be vsed in those battayles. So that after they had wel debated the matter touching y^e vali|antnesse of that worthy <HI>knight,</HI> they all together went forth of the caue, &amp; went vnto the city, wheras that fayre Qu&eacute;ene was receyned with great honour &amp; admiration of all peo|ple, &amp; within a few dayes after the Qu&eacute;ene and the <HI>Prince Luziro</HI> were made sure together, &amp; at theyr <HI>Marriage</HI> there was made great feasts &amp; triumphs.

<P>_THE great fame which these two <HI>Princes</HI> gate in the iusts that they did maintaine in the Citie of <HI>Paris,</HI> was such, that not on|ly the <HI>Knights</HI> of the <HI>kingdome,</HI> but also di|uers <HI>Knightes</HI> of other prouinces &amp; coun|tries dyd come to proue themselues with them, and as it is a common thing the fame, &amp; in especiall of such not able iusts, doe flie abroad into all parts.

<PB REF="33">
when the fame of these two <HI>Knights</HI> which were in <HI>Paris,</HI> came vnto the <HI>Gyants</HI> eares, and of the rich Tent that was prepared for the prise of this Iust, it strayght wayes gaue him a desire to goe thether, as one that was certaine that ten such <HI>Knights</HI> as they were, were not sufficient to defend the Tent&punc; but that by his prowesse he must bring it away&punc; And to execute his determination, he strayght way departed from the citie of <HI>Paris,</HI> &amp; caryed in his company to the number of ten <HI>Knights:</HI> and came thether one day before that the two moneths of the Iusts did end, wheras the two <HI>Princes</HI> were doing of meruailous deedes of armes.

And when they saw him so great &amp; ill fauored, they al feared him, &amp; made him a large &amp; brode way, that he might passe forwards. And when the <HI>Ci|aunt</HI> saw the rich Tent where it was, hee went towards it and did behold it with great admiration, and it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> on|to him to be very rich and straunge: and after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ad satisfied himselfe with the sight thereof, hee said: which bee the <HI>Knights</HI> which doth defende this Tent.

And if thou dost ouerthrow mee from my horse, the Tent shall b&eacute;e thine, without any deniall of mee or my com|panion. The <HI>Gyaunt</HI> when hee saw him-selfe so little este|med of one <HI>Knight,</HI> he was so full of fury and wrath, that h&eacute;e could not refraine his yre, but drew out a mighty great and broud fauchon which was hanging at his girdell, and went to strike the Prince <HI>Clauerindo</HI> vppon the healme, thincking there-with to cleaue him downe vnto the wast. But the Prince who was a very stout and pollitike <HI>Knight,</HI> and in many things dyd resemble his friend the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> b&eacute;efore that the Faulchin could execute the <HI>Gyaunts</HI> determination, hee gaue a great leap with his horse on the one side, that the <HI>Gyaunt</HI> lost his blow, and it was sticke in vaine. And by reason that the blow descended right downe, hee stroke his owne horse vpon the head, that h&eacute;e cloue it in two peeces&punc; and hee fell downe dead to the ground with his maister&punc; so that the <HI>Gyant</HI> could not rise vp againe without great paine and griefe, for that the horse in his fall caught the <HI>Gyaunts</HI> leg vnder him. The King and all that dyd be|hold them, fell in a laughter, and had great pleasure in that which the <HI>Gyant</HI> had done: Although his comming thether was a great griefe vnto manie. For according vnto the great fame which he had in those parts, they thought verely that the two <HI>Knights</HI> could not haue sufficient force and might for to defend the Tent, but that hee would win it and carrie it away. When the <HI>Gyaunt</HI> saw himselfe without a horse, with great yre hee arose vp and went towardes the <HI>Prince&punc;</HI> who with a trice leaped from his horse back&punc; for that hee would haue no aduantage of him, &amp; drew out his sword and did abide his comming: so that beetwixt the~ there began <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> very angry and well foughten battaile, striking on euery <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e, that it was strange &amp; wonderful to beehold.

tempered by art magicke, which was giuen him by the wise <HI>Lirgandeo,</HI> of the which h&eacute;e was sure that whatsoeuer blow his aduersary dyd fasten vppon him, it should not hurt him, which was the occasion that although the <HI>Gyaunt</HI> were of much more force, yet h&eacute;e should maintayne himselfe verie wel against him and make him to abate his great arrogan|sie and pride. And by reason that the <HI>Gyant</HI> was bigge and heauy, the <HI>Prince</HI> did strike him at all times at his pleasure, and many times h&eacute;e did cut his armour and flesh, whereat issued out great abundance of blood.</P>
<P>The King and all those that did b&eacute;eholde the battaile, greatly maruailed at the prowesse of that <HI>Knight,</HI> but a|boue all, his vnckle <HI>Armineo,</HI> was very glad and ioyfull, that h&eacute;e made his partie so good in the battaile, &amp; said with|in himselfe, that it h&eacute;e dyd perseuer and bring it vnto a good ende, that with great honour the <HI>Prince</HI> might discouer him selfe vnto his Parents: and dyd pray to God with all his hart to aide and help him in that battaile, for that it conti|newed still very dangerous and full of perill.

<P>It was a great incouraging vnto the prince <HI>Clauerindo,</HI> to s&eacute;e himselfe in presence of his Parentes, and hoped that very shortly he would giue them to vnderstand thereof. And this was the occasion that made him to bee the more fury|ous against his enimie. The <HI>Gyant</HI> when h&eacute;e saw himselfe wounded, and all the ground be sprinckled with his blood, h&eacute;e greatly wondred at the strength and resistance of his ene|mie:
<PB N="30" REF="34">
and finding all things cleane contrary vnto his expec|tation before hee began the battell, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> was almost ashamed, yet h&eacute;e b&eacute;el&eacute;eued that the state of his victorie dyd remaine onely in the striking of one full blow vpon the Helme of his aduersary. And therewith hee tooke his great Fauchon in both his hands, and went towards y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> prince, making a show as though hee should strike him vpon the heade, whereat the Prince stooped on the one side, and the <HI>Gyaunt</HI> dyd stay the striking of his blow, till afterward vnaduisedly at his plea|sure, he stroke him vpon the <HI>Inchanted</HI> Healme, that it made all them that looked on, to maruaile how h&eacute;e could sustaine or suffer such wonderfull fury, for that it was sufficient to haue cloue a great rock asunder, but by reason of the ver|tue of his armour, made by that wyse <HI>Lyrgandeo</HI> for such necessities, that the Prince receiued no damage of that fu|rious blow: but by the great strength wherewith it was giuen, hee thought verely all his skull had b&eacute;ene broken to p&eacute;eces, and therewith h&eacute;e bowed his kn&eacute;es to the ground, remayning for a good space all astonied, that h&eacute;e could not arise vp.</P>
<P>When the furious <HI>Gyant</HI> saw him in that trance, h&eacute;e tur|ned againe and lift vp his mightie Fauchon and stroke him an other blow in the verie same place, and by reason that with the other blow his fauchon was crased with the force and strength of the second blow, it brake in thr&eacute;e p&eacute;eces, in such sort, that there remayned in his hands but onely the hilt, which was the occasion that the blow dyd no harme, otherwise it had cost him his lyfe, and with the noyse there|of h&eacute;e came vnto himselfe, and arose vp somewhat amazed, and with the furie of that great blow, hee dyd not see that the <HI>Gyaunt</HI> was without a Sword, but entred in with him in a great rage, and stroke him such an ouerthwrat blow vpon the thigh, that h&eacute;e cut his armour and flesh vnto the hard bone: of the which the <HI>Gyaunt</HI> felt himselfe verie euill.</P>
<P>The <HI>Gyant</HI> s&eacute;eing himselfe without wepon, he wold haue entred in with his enimy, to haue caught him in his armes.
<PB REF="35">
but the Prince vnderstanding his pretence, recoyling back threw a foyne at him, which chaunced on his beauer which was broken, and thrust him thorough and through the head, wherewith this firce and vglie <HI>Brandafuriell</HI> fell downe dead to the ground, it was vnto all them that dyd b&eacute;eholds what passed, a great admyration and wonder, when they saw so sterce and mighty a <HI>Gyaunt,</HI> who in all those parts was greatly dreaded &amp; feared, in so short space ouerthrowen and slayne, by one onely <HI>Knight,</HI> and for that the King could not away with him for certayne angers and griefes which continually h&eacute;e dyd vnto him, hee was very glad and receiued great ioy for his death, and thought long to know the <HI>Knight</HI> who had done that valyaunt and worthie deede, being certified within himselfe, that there was not a <HI>Knight</HI> in all the world lyke vnto him in courage and strength.</P>
<P>When the Prince <HI>Clauerindo</HI> saw himselfe cleere of that monstrous <HI>Gyant,</HI> h&eacute;e lifted vp his eyes to heauen and gaue great thankes vnto the almightie God, and put his sword into his sheath, and went towardes the Prince <HI>Brandizell</HI> &amp; <HI>Armineo</HI> his vnckle, who receiued him with great plea|sure and ioye, s&eacute;eing the honour &amp; prayse which hee had won in that place, and said amongst themselues that it was not then time to k&eacute;epe them any longer vnknowen, but great reason to discouer themselues. And therewith they all thr&eacute;e together went towards the place wheras the King and the Queene were, accompanied with all the principall <HI>Knights</HI> of the Court, and when they came beefore them, without ta|king of their healme, they dyd their duetie and reuerence, the King receiued them verie gladlie, and reioyced much with them. Them <HI>Armineo</HI> beegan to speake and saide.</P>
<P><Q>Most mightie King, you shall vnderstand that these <HI>Knights</HI> are come from straunge Countries vnto this thy court, not so much to get honour h&eacute;ere amongst thy <HI>Knights</HI> as to giue th&eacute;e certaine newes, at the which thou wilt re|ceiue great ioy and contentment, which are concerning thy sonne the Prince <HI>Clauerindo,</HI> who many yeeres past was lost, beeing carried away by a great rouer from his Coun|trie,</Q>

who at this present is a liue and doth very well, and is waxed such a <HI>Knight,</HI> that in the whole world you haue very few lyke vnto him, and in company with him is his vnckle <HI>Armineo,</HI> with no small desire to come and s&eacute;e thee, and euer since they were taken by that Rouer, they haue b&eacute;ene alwaies together, and as w&eacute;e doo vnderstand they wil not b&eacute;e long from hence.</P>
<P>The King when h&eacute;e heard these ioyfull newes, with a loude voyce sayde: Oh mighty God, is it possible that my Sonne <HI>Clauerindo</HI> and my Brother <HI>Armineo</HI> b&eacute;e aliue, and that there hath b&eacute;ene in my court who hath seene them, and neuer tould m&eacute;e till now, and so long time past. And in say|ing these words h&eacute;e turned vnto <HI>Armineo</HI> and said: Gentle <HI>Knight,</HI> s&eacute;eing that you haue brought m&eacute;e so ioyfull newes, I pray you also tell m&eacute;e where you dyd leaue them, that I may send to s&eacute;eke them, so shall I haue my ioye wholy ful|filled. It shall not n&eacute;ede that your highnes doo send to s&eacute;eke them said <HI>Armineo,</HI> for that they are within the Kingdome of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> and will b&eacute;e h&eacute;ere very shortly. When <HI>Armi|neo</HI> had sayde these words, the King was in a great doubt whether this which the <HI>Knight</HI> had told him was true, and whether h&eacute;e spake it in manner of mockage. The Qu&eacute;ene who was present when sh&eacute;e heard these words, thought it a thing impossible to b&eacute;e true. Then the King arose vp from the place whereas h&eacute;e sat, and went vnto <HI>Armineo,</HI> and cost his armes about his neck, saying: O gentle <HI>Knight,</HI> tell m&eacute;e if this b&eacute;e true which thou hast sayde, or whether thou boost it to mocke with m&eacute;e, for that my sad and sorrowfull hart cannot beel&eacute;eue this ioyfull newes to b&eacute;e of truth.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Armineo</HI> sayd. I will not tell any thing vnto your highnesse but that which is of truth, and for that you shall b&eacute;e put in greater admiration vnderstand that h&eacute;e which slew in your presence that vgly and monstrous <HI>Gyaunt Brandafuriell,</HI> is the <HI>Prince Clauerindo</HI> your Sonne, and the other <HI>Knight</HI> his companyon is the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Persia,</HI> and I am thy Brother <HI>Armineo.</HI> And in saying these words they all thr&eacute;e pulled of theyr Healmes, and strayght wayes the

King and the Qu&eacute;ene did know <HI>Armineo,</HI> and although the <HI>Prince</HI> was lost in his tender age, yet in the proportion of his face they did very well remember him, at which words with a sodaine and vnlooked for ioy, they ran vnto him and clasped their armes about him, and remained a great while embraced together, and could not speake one word with the great ioy and pleasure which they receiued. So in the end when that their harls and armes had contented themselues with that louing and ioyfull m&eacute;eting, they fel into commu|nication, wheras b&eacute;etwixt the~ ther passed a great discourse of their liues, whereby the King and the Qu&eacute;ene was fully satisfied of all that the <HI>Prince Clauerindo</HI> and <HI>Armineo</HI> had passed, after such time as they were taken prisoners by the power of that great rouer <HI>Mambriniano.</HI> So when the king and the Qu&eacute;ene heard of the great misfortunes &amp; traualles that their son had passed, &amp; was now in their presence ac|companied with that mightie Prince <HI>Brandizel,</HI> with whom hee was brought vp, there was no ioy that might be compa|red vnto theirs, and they gaue great thanks vnto God, for such his mercifull benefits shewed vpon them.

Incontinentlye all those which did beare them company, at the commandement of the <HI>King</HI> did a part themselues from the two <HI>Knights,</HI> &amp; were appointed for <HI>Iudges</HI> the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Austria,</HI> &amp; the <HI>Earle</HI> of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> who were the best esteemed in all the Court, did deuide the space betwixt the two <HI>Knights,</HI> &amp; put each of them in his place. When the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> saw him|selfe at liberty, he sayd vnto himselfe: Oh mighty <HI>Emperour Trebatio,</HI> how maist thou blame me of forgetfulnes towards thy maiestie, for that I haue not performed the vow which I promised th&eacute;e, to see thee straight after thy comming into <HI>Grecia&punc;</HI> the <HI>Gods</HI> do know how much I haue desired it, not|withstanding if it fortune this day, my purpose is to s&eacute;e th&eacute;e very shortly.

Likewise the strong &amp; mightie <HI>Greeke</HI> came forth to meete him, with so great fu|rye, that in the running of his horse, the ground s&eacute;emed to tremble whereas hee went, and in the middest of their course they ioyned together with theyr Speares, and <HI>Flo|rinaldus</HI> brake his great Speare vppon the fine armour of the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> in such sort that h&eacute;e shieue|red it in a thousand peeces, which flew into the ayre, but this strong and stout <HI>Knight</HI> remayned firme in his Sad|dle, and made his encounter with <HI>Florinaldus,</HI> striking him on the breast with so great power and strength, that he ouerthrew him and his horse to the ground one vppon another, in such for that his horse fell vpon him, that h&eacute;e could not arise by any meanes, whereby this gallaunt and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Knight</HI> was very ill intreated, and lay along vpon

<P>Strayght way there was heard in the great place many shrikes and cryings, and looking what they should b&eacute;e, they saw it was the kinsefolkes of <HI>Florinaldus,</HI> who thought that he had bene slaine, and beganne to lament his death, and the death of the Earle. When the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> saw <HI>Florinaldus</HI> did not rise vp agayne, h&eacute;e went vnto the Iudges and demaunded of them if there were a|ny more to be done to cl&eacute;ere himselfe from that enterprise&punc; To whom the Iudges aunswered, that touching the bat|tayle there was nothing else to bee done, and as for any other thing, they did not know the <HI>Kinges</HI> pleasure. In the meane time the <HI>King</HI> was very sorrowfull, and thought surely that <HI>Florinaldus</HI> had b&eacute;ene dead, wherfore h&eacute;e called his chamberlaine and commaunded him to goe and charge the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> to re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ourne agayne into the pri|son, and that the gardes should beare him company till h&eacute;e came to the Tower, where h&eacute;e should remaine as pri|soner.

<P><PB REF="41">If you doe remember that after the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> had ouercome that stout &amp; valiant <HI>Knight Aridon</HI> of the blacke wood, the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Pannonia,</HI> and he confessed all the treason that was conspired betwixt them against the <HI>Dutchesse,</HI> and how that the <HI>King</HI> commaunded theyr heads should be cut off in the middest of the place, without any pardon, although many <HI>Knights</HI> &amp; great Lords did importunate the <HI>King</HI> for their pardon. Now the History saith that this <HI>Aridon,</HI> of the blacke wood had a brother called <HI>Egion,</HI> a young man of a mightie stature &amp; force, and of a singuler courage for to at|tempt any thing, who was in the blacke wood, at such time as <HI>Aridon</HI> was beheaded. Also the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Pannonia</HI> had likewise another brother called <HI>Farmonte,</HI> a valiant <HI>Knight</HI> and very proud, being Lord ouer many Countries in high <HI>Almaine</HI> nigh vnto the blacke wood, who went abroad s&eacute;e|king his aduentures in those parts, &amp; had got vnto himselfe great fame &amp; renowne, for many d&eacute;edes of armes which h&eacute;e had done in that country. Now when the death of their bre|thren came vnto their knowledge, &amp; in what sort the <HI>King Tiberio</HI> commaunded them to b&eacute;e slaine, they were very sor|rowfull for the same, and eyther of them determined within himselfe to annoy the <HI>King Tiberio</HI> all that euer they could, till such time as they were reuenged of the death of theyr brethren.

whe~ he had opened this vnto <HI>Egion,</HI> they both determined to goe &amp; talke with him, &amp; to desire him if it were his pleasure, to be a companion in that enterprise.

<P>And when they came vnto the blacke wood, <HI>Egion</HI> dyd chuse other ten <HI>Knightes</HI> of the best and strongest that hee had.

And for that purpose they brought with them a Coach. with foure wh&eacute;eles, drawen with six mightie Horsses, and very swift, such as in a short space wold cary them a great way: into the which coach they put the Queene and hir gen|tlewomen, whose lamentacions were so loude, that they might bee heard a great way.

<P>This was the great noyse of r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">mour &amp; the cryes which dyd wake the <HI>Knight</HI> of the Sunne out of his sleepe, in the Forrest, thinking vpon that great traua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e which hee had with the <HI>Knights</HI> of the King <HI>Tiberio,</HI> in the Citie o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> <HI>Ratis|bona:</HI> and in the verie same night dyd this wrong happen vnto the Qu&eacute;ene, and the coach dyd draw neere the place whereas h&eacute;e was a sleepe.

And on both sides of the Coach, rode the two valiant knights <HI>Egion</HI> and <HI>Farmonte,</HI> with ech of them a battaile axe in their hands. And their furious and fearse semblaunce which they showed, was no lesse to b&eacute;e feared, (by reason of the greatnes of their bodies) then the <HI>Gyants.</HI> And after the coach ther followed to the number of fift&eacute;ene knights, which remayned of twentie that they brought foorth, all on horsebacke, and well armed: who went k&eacute;e|ping of the Gentlewomen, that they should not fall out of the coach. All this the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> stayed to b&eacute;ehold, and by the shricks which the gentlewomen gaue, and by the words which they spake, h&eacute;e dyd well vnderstand, that the <HI>Gyant</HI> and those <HI>Knights</HI> dyd carrie the~ away by force.

And before h&eacute;e had any time to settle himselfe againe, the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> entred in with him, and raysing vp himselfe in his Styrops, h&eacute;e stroke with both his hands so furious and terrible a blow at his wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">. that by reason the ioynts of his armour was in that place in a maner broken with his former conflicts, h&eacute;e cut the body in two p&eacute;eces, in such sort, that the one halfe remained in the Saddle, and the other halfe from the wast vpward fell downe to the ground: and it was so quicklie done, that when <HI>Egion</HI> and that mightie <HI>Farmonte</HI> b&eacute;ehelde the battaile, with that wonderfull and terrible blow, &amp; saw the halfe body of the <HI>Gyant</HI> fell vnto the earth. And b&eacute;ehol|ding the knight which had done that d&eacute;ede, with his sword in his hand all bloody, they receiued great admiracion, and either of them thought within him-selfe, that it should bee some selestiall creature, sent from God for to destroy them: for that they could not perswade with themselues that in a mortall man there should b&eacute;e so great force and strength. Yet b&eacute;ecause they were valyant <HI>Knights,</HI> and high minded, and of proude condition, either of them dyd assault him with great yre and wrath: and the first that approched vn|to him was the mighty <HI>Farmonte,</HI> who with both his hands stroke such a right downe blow at the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> which lighted vpon his right shoulder, that it had b&eacute;ene suf|ficient to cleane him to his breast, if that his inchaunted armour had not defended him. And by reason that the hat|chet could not cut, the strength of the blow was the heaui|er, in such sort, that it made him to double and bow his bo|die forwards, that his breast touched the saddle bow, and h&eacute;e hadde not well settled him-selfe in his saddle agayne, when that on the other side, h&eacute;e was assalted by the migh|tie <HI>Egion,</HI> who with his mightie hatchet, stroke a nother right downe blow at him, that if h&eacute;e had chaunsed to hit him, it could not but n&eacute;edes it must haue done him great harme.</P>
<P>But this couragious and valyant <HI>Knight,</HI> whose exc&eacute;e|ding lightnesse and strength, was in all poynts equall:

When the Qu&eacute;ene vnder|stood that it was the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> and knew him by the <HI>Sunn</HI> which h&eacute;e had vpon his armour, hir ioy &amp; pleasure did the more increase, &amp; thincking hir selfe in a great deale more safetie then b&eacute;efore, sh&eacute;e said: Now I doo well know &amp; vnderstand that my fortune is falne out much better then I did make reckoning of, for that it hath pleased God to haue so great a care ouer me, as to bring me such a <HI>Knight</HI> in this our most extremitie, and considering the great good which thy co~ming hath b&eacute;ene vnto vs, I cannot impute it, but vnto the goodnes of God in this our necessity.

So after that they had a great discourse about this matter, the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> tooke his leaue of the Qu&eacute;ene, at which time were come together tenne or twelue of the Qu&eacute;enes <HI>Knights,</HI> who had hid themselues for fear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> of the <HI>Gyaunt,</HI> and when they saw that they could not by anie meanes perswade the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> to retourne vnto the court againe, they suffered him to depart, although it grie|ued them very much that hee should depart in such sort, b&eacute;e|fore the king had rewarded him, for the great benefit which they all receiued at his hands.

<P>Oh worthy <HI>knight,</HI> I doe verely b&eacute;el&eacute;eue that thou art sent of God, to defend and maintayne the feeble and weake persons, &amp; to chastise the proude and arroga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">t&punc; For that I was present at such time as thou wert brought vnto the ci|tie of <HI>Ratisbona,</HI> for to make battaile with <HI>Aridon</HI> of the blacke woode, and now at this present art come for to set m&eacute;e at liberty from this great outrage which these <HI>knights</HI> would haue done vnto me: so that I verely bel&eacute;eue that by great mistery thou art sent for our aid &amp; help, therfore (gen|tle <HI>Knight</HI>) thou shalt vnderstand, that the occasion wher|fore these traiterous <HI>Knights</HI> would haue slaine vs, was, for that the one of them many dayes past, dyd demaund of m&eacute;e for wife my daughter, whom you haue deliuered out of their power. And for that I did know he was an euill, ma|licious &amp; a traiterous <HI>knight,</HI> &amp; a very coward, I would ne|uer graunt vnto the same: neyther wold my daughter con|sent ther&punc; vnto. And for to reuenge themselues thereof, this morning at such time as the gate of the Castell was open, w&eacute;e b&eacute;eing without all feare &amp; suspection, vppon a sodaine, the sixe <HI>Knights</HI> which you haue s&eacute;ene, entred in, &amp; amongst them came the same <HI>Knights</HI> which I haue tolde you of. And because I did perceiue their determination was to kill vs, &amp; to carry away my daughter with violence and parforce, which certainly, &amp; without all doubt had happened in this or|der, if it had not pleased God that thou shouldest haue come hether to giue vs aide and succour.</P>
<P>So at such time as this auncient man hadde made an end in saying these wordes, the <HI>Gentlewoman</HI> his daugh|ter, whom the <HI>Knight</HI> of the Sunne had deliuered from the two <HI>Knights,</HI> came whereas they were.

For whose comming the father and hir bretheren receiued double ioy, &amp; the no lesse ioyfull, for that she found them cleere from the outrage which they would haue done vnto them. So that neyther of them dyd know in what sort they might gratifie the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> for the great benefit which they had receiued at his hands, but offred vnto him all that they had. And for that he found in them so great good will, h&eacute;e determined to way there certaine dayes, to comfort and ease himselfe: for that hee found his bodye in many places brused &amp; ill intreated, with the battailes which he had with the <HI>Knights</HI> of the <HI>King Tiberio,</HI> &amp; the <HI>Gyaunt</HI> and with his <HI>Knights</HI> when he set at liberty the Qu&eacute;ene <HI>Augusta,</HI> for al|though his good armour did defend him from being woun|ded, yet his body could not but receiue great damage, &amp; h&eacute;e tormented by the heauy waight and strength of the blowes which he receiued, &amp; he felt himselfe vory sore therwith, in such sort, that he had great n&eacute;ede to be cured therof. All which he declared vnto the lord of the castle, &amp; vnto his sonnes, who were very ioyfull, &amp; receiued great contentment at the same, as those who were very desirous to serue &amp; pleasure him in all that euer they could. So the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> remay|ned ther certaine daies in which time he was meruailously well cured of his bruses, by the <HI>gentlewoman,</HI> who was cun|ning &amp; expert in chirurgery, &amp; did it with a very good grace.</P>
<P>The <HI>Gentlewomans</HI> name was <HI>Oliuia,</HI> and hir fathers name was <HI>Onorio,</HI> and his sonnes names were <HI>Aurellio,</HI> &amp; <HI>Binnano,</HI> and they all did loue him very much, and would that he should neuer depart from thence, from their compa|nie. But at such time that h&eacute;e would n&eacute;eds depart, the fa|ther requested the <HI>Knight</HI> to graunt him a bowne, which was, that he should receiue into seruice his two sonnes, and cary them with him for his pages.

The newes of all this came vnto the eares of the king <HI>Oliuerio,</HI> who although h&eacute;e had almost forgot the losse of the <HI>Prince,</HI> by reason of the long time passed since it happened, yet these new news of his death was so dolorous, that it did renue within his thought the great loue which hee bare vnto him, as vnto his sonne, that in a small time they thought verely h&eacute;e would die with very sorrow, but the principal remedy that he tooke for his comfort, was to determine himselfe to take reuengement for the <HI>Princes</HI> death vppon the <HI>Emperour,</HI> and although hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> power was not so great as the power of the <HI>Emperour,</HI> ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> h&eacute;e thought that the king <HI>Tiberio</HI> to fulfill the great obly|gation in the which h&eacute;e was bound vnto him, would giu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> him aide and succour: and againe the Prince <HI>Don Silueri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> would likewise succour him with all his power, which wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> very great, giuing him for spouse his daughter the Prince

And touching all his determination he did write him a letter at large, of the which he had an answere againe to his desire, for that y^e king <HI>Tiberio</HI> acknowledging how much hee was bound vnto him, could doe nothing to the contrary but offer himself in all y^t he might to help him, although he wished for his part that all were excused, for it s&eacute;emed vnto him that if the <HI>Emperour</HI> Trebatio slew the prince <HI>Edward,</HI> it was with his speare in his hand, &amp; in battell one with the other, lyke knights, and therfore he should not be blamed in such sort, to take such reuengement against him, and although he had all this within his thought, &amp; was well content to haue y^e <HI>Em|perour</HI> for his son in law, yet h&eacute;e wold not giue any body to vnderstand therof, for that he was a king which alwaies had a great respect in matters of estimation and honour, which was the occasion that the king <HI>Oliuerio</HI> as aforesaid, had of him a very good answere, and to his contentment. Likewise h&eacute;e wrote to the king of <HI>Spaine,</HI> who also did offer vnto him all hee requested when h&eacute;e had n&eacute;ede thereof. In the meane time that all this passed, y^e king <HI>Oliuerio</HI> trauailed with the Princesse <HI>Oliuia</HI> his daughter, that sh&eacute;e should think wel to receiue for hir spouse the Prince <HI>Don Siluerio,</HI> laying before hir his great valure, and the necessitie hee had of him: so considering this matter many times the king did importu|nate hir, sometimes with requestes, and other times with threatenings, in such sort that this fayre.

Likewise it was knowen in <HI>England,</HI> that <HI>Rosicleer</HI> the young knight, who had left so great fame in all that countrie, was sonne vnto the <HI>Empe|rour Trebatio</HI> and the Empresse <HI>Briana,</HI> which newes did greatly content all people. And when the Princesse Oliuia vnderstood the whole misterie, one way hir ioye surmoun|ted, in seeing that hee whom sh&eacute;e loued more then hir owne selfe, was sonne vnto so mightie an <HI>Emperour,</HI> and that ther was not betweene them the kindred which shee thought had b&eacute;ene, and another way shee dyd greatly repent hir selfe of that which sh&eacute;e had done against him, and the more was hir griefe when shee called to remembrance all that which had passed, insomuch that sh&eacute;e did nothing else but w&eacute;epe at all times when sh&eacute;e was alone. Now after the king hir father had receiued an answere from the King <HI>Tiberio,</HI> and from the King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> talking with <HI>Don Siluerio,</HI> h&eacute;e gaue him to vnderstand his determined purpose, &amp; a new h&eacute;e di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> offer vnto him his daughter, the Lady <HI>Oliuia</HI> for his spouse, saying that first b&eacute;efore hee did performe the same, it should be great reason that he returne into his kingdome of <HI>Lusi|tania,</HI> and giue his parents to vnderstand thereof, and to let them know all the warre that hee did determine to b&eacute;egin against the <HI>Emperour Trebatio,</HI> for that h&eacute;e might haue his people in a readynesse for to him giue all the ayde and suc|cour that possiblie h&eacute;e could, for that the Prince dyd in|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">irelie loue the Princesse <HI>Oliuia,</HI> hee desired nothing more then to plesure the king in all that h&eacute;e could, so that straight way h&eacute;e did promise the King to performe all that h&eacute;e had commanded.

Now the History saith, that in this sort they dyd nauigate by Sea a long time, till it happened vpon a day verie earely in the morning they discouered land, which being knowen by the marriners, they said that it was the Kingdome of <HI>Lusitania.</HI> And when these three Princes vnderstood the certantie thereof, they determined there to goe a land hoping y^t they should heare some newes of their friend <HI>Rosicleer,</HI> for that they were certaine wher|soeuer hee did beecome, his noble valiantnesse was such, that

it would be noised throughout all the Countrie. Wherefore they left the sea, and beeing a land they tooke their Horsses and followed the way which they liked best, and trauailed by it a good while, which in the ende brought them vnto the top of a mighty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">, from whence they did discouer somwhat a far of, a mighty great plaine, and in the most therof was scituated a faire Citie, hard by a riuers side, which seemed to be very great &amp; huge.

Then these <HI>Knights</HI> did compasse the <HI>Princes</HI> round about, &amp; demanded of them fro~ whence they came, &amp; what they sought in those parts, and they answered that they were straunge <HI>Knights,</HI> and not knowen in that countrie, and for that they had seene their camp they came thether as <HI>Knights</HI> that doth s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">rue for wages, Then those of the camp when they heard their answere, &amp; saw that they s&eacute;emed to be <HI>Knights</HI> of esti|matio~, as wel by their rich armor which they had, as by their good &amp; gentle dispositions, determined to conduct them before the king their Lord, for that he might determine with them at his plesure, and so they brought them before their Lord, who was king of <HI>Balachia,</HI> which pretended to take the king|dome o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> <HI>Lufitania</HI> (for that it bordered vpon him) and entred into that countrie with a mightie armie, and sh&eacute;e that was Lady &amp; gouernour at that time was widow woman called <HI>Lauinia,</HI> who had a daughter whose name was <HI>Olimpa,</HI> a ve|rie fayre Damsell, and by reason that shee had no husband, neither power to bee compared vnto the King of <HI>Balachia,</HI>

was b&eacute;esiged in the same Citie, defending hir selfe within with such people as she had, in the best maner y^t sh&eacute;e might. All this was told vnto these princes in y^e way as they went before the king.

The Tartarian <HI>Zoylo</HI> who could speake the language, was requested of the rest of his companions to answere for them, who sayde.</P>
<P><Q>You shall vnderstand O king of <HI>Balachia,</HI> that w&eacute;e are tra|uailing knights, &amp; of the countrie of <HI>Tartaria,</HI> and do trauell into the world to s&eacute;eke our aduentures, and although we be exercised in the wars, yet w&eacute;e are accustomed to serue none in them, except first w&eacute;e know what our wages shal b&eacute;e, and it is in this order as I will tell you, and therof there is not to be diminished or taken away any thing, so that we thr&eacute;e will iust with all such knights as will come foorth against vs till such time as w&eacute;e b&eacute;e ouerthrowen, and if so fall out y^t wee at the first encounter b&eacute;e ouerthrowen, then we thr&eacute;e will serue th&eacute;e one whole y&eacute;ere for nothing, and if it b&eacute;e our fortune to ouerthrow any, the~ either of vs so many knights as is ouer throwen by vs, looke how much wages all they together haue, so much must either of vs haue, according to the number that h&eacute;e doth ouerthrow. This is our vse and custome of seruice in the wars, therfore O king, looke if that this our manner of seruice content th&eacute;e, and if not, giue vs lysence to depart, that w&eacute;e may goe to some other place to s&eacute;eke our aduenture.</Q></P>
<P>When the Tartarian <HI>Zoylo</HI> had made an end of this his sp&eacute;ech, the king and all that were in his Tent laughed very much at that which was spoken, not for that they did think much in the wages which they did aske, but for that ther s&eacute;e med to be amongst them <HI>Knights,</HI> y^t if they might come forth
<PB REF="54">
to the iust with them, at the first should remaine and serue a whole yeare without any wages, and for that they knew this for a certaintie, the king did straight way graunt vn|to all that which the Tartarian <HI>Zoylo</HI> had demanded, and sayd that h&eacute;e was verie well content to stand vnto that should happen, and the matter being by all them agr&eacute;ed vp|pon, these thr&eacute;e Princes went out of the Campe into the plaine field, wheras they might iust at their pleasure. Like|wise the King went foorth with his principall <HI>Knights,</HI> such as did serue him for wages, to s&eacute;e what should happen.</P>
<P>Now the king commanded straight way perticularly the best and most valyauntest Knights that were in all the Camp should come forth to iust with the thr&eacute;e Princes, who were in a redinesse a horseback with their speares in their handes, abiding the comming of those who should iust with them. The first which came foorth to iust with them, were thr&eacute;e valiant <HI>Knights,</HI> of a mightie proportion and stature, such as in all the camp could not b&eacute;e found the lyke, and b&eacute;e|ing in their places one agaynst another, they made them|selues ready vnto the iust, but whosoeuer had s&eacute;ene them at that time, would haue iudged the thr&eacute;e Princes at the first encounter should haue remayned without any wages, and especially the King who laughed at the accord which was made beetwixt them, but it fell out cleane contrarie vnto their thought, for that all sixe together mette in the middest of their course, and the three <HI>Knights</HI> of the Campe broke their speares vpon the Princes without moouing of them in their Saddles, but the Princes made their encounter with so great force, that they hoised them out of their saddles, in such sort that they tumbled vpon the ground, and passed for|wards so stiffe and vpright in their course, that they put the King and all those that dyd beehold them in great admira|tion, but not long after there came forth other thr&eacute;e <HI>Knights</HI> to the iust, which were also thr&eacute;e of the best and most est&eacute;e|med amongst all the rest, and looke as these Princes dyd serue the first, so dyd they serue those thr&eacute;e, and ouerthrew them to the ground, and finally in the space of one houre
<PB N="49" REF="54" MS="y">
they had ouerthrowen to the number of fift&eacute;ene <HI>Knights</HI> of the most valiantest &amp; worthiest amongst them all. Then the <HI>King</HI> found himselfe halfe ashamed &amp; mocked, with the bar|gaine he had made with them, &amp; it seemed vnto him that ac|cording vnto their great valiantnes &amp; strength, they would haue ouerthrowen all the <HI>knights</HI> that were in the campe, the one after the other, so that according vnto the bargaine, all his treasure should not be sufficient to pay their wages. When that mightie &amp; monstrous <HI>Gyant</HI> that was with the <HI>King</HI> saw him that he was somewhat sad &amp; heauy for that which the <HI>Knights</HI> had done, he commaunded straight way to be brought vnto him a horse which was very great &amp; con|formable vnto his bignesse, &amp; straight way he leaped vppon him, &amp; chose one of the bigest speares that he could finde a|mongst all the rest, &amp; said vnto the king that he would iust with those <HI>Knights,</HI> &amp; bad them come all thr&eacute;e against him, and that he hoped so to intreat them in the iust, that after|ward they should neyther bee able to take wages nor to weare armour. The <HI>King</HI> receiued great delight when h&eacute;e saw the <HI>Gyant</HI> on horsbacke, &amp; was very certaine that his power and strength was to performe all that which h&eacute;e had said, yea, if they had b&eacute;ene ten such <HI>knights</HI> together as they were. And when this proud &amp; furtous <HI>Gyant</HI> was in a readi|nes to the iust, these valtant <HI>Princes</HI> who were very desi|rous to get honour, either of them did procure to proue their aduenture with him, but this mighty <HI>Tartarian</HI> with many requests vnto his companions did begin to iust with this mightie <HI>Gyant,</HI> &amp; when the <HI>Gyant</HI> saw that alone <HI>knight</HI> did put himselfe before him, he would not moue one iot from the place whereas he was, but cried out vnto the <HI>knights,</HI> that they should come forth against him all thr&eacute;e. But when h&eacute;e saw his words did little profit him, with great fury &amp; infer|nall courage he made his course against the valiant <HI>Tar|tarian,</HI> who with a worthy courage, as one that was both stout &amp; strong of hart, broched his horse with the spurs and went forth to m&eacute;et him, &amp; in the middest of their course they met so strongly together, y^t their great speares were broken
<PB REF="55">
into small shiuers &amp; this stout <HI>Tartarian</HI> did double with his body backwards, in such sort that his head strike di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> vpon y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> Horse crouper, &amp; being somewhat astonied with that strong incounter, he passed forwards on his Horse, &amp; straight waies did settle himselfe agayne in the saddle, but the strong &amp; de|formed <HI>Gyant,</HI> Horse &amp; all fell downe vnto the ground, with which fall they made a meruaylous great noise, &amp; he had his saddle fast betwixt his legges. When the <HI>King Balachia</HI> saw his <HI>Gyant</HI> on the earth, he was very heauy in his hart, and commaunded that no more <HI>Knights</HI> should come forth to the iust, but that the three <HI>Princes</HI> should be brought before him, at which time the monstrous giant did arise from the ground, and drew out a great &amp; mighty fauchon which he had at his girdle, &amp; went towards the <HI>Princes</HI> &amp; said, that they all thr&eacute;e together should make battaile with him.</P>
<P>The thr&eacute;e <HI>Princes</HI> not making any reckoning of his wordes, on horsebacke as they were, went before the <HI>King,</HI> and asked him if he were content to pay them theyr bar|gaine that was made betwixt them, if not, they would de|part vnto some other place whereas they thought best. Then the <HI>King</HI> who was meruaylous angrye and offended with them, aunswered and sayd&punc; I will that you serue me in this my warres, and afterward it shall be at my pleasure to pay you for your seruice, and if you will graunt vnto this with a good will doe it, if not I will make you perforce. Then these three <HI>Princes</HI> who had no desire to tary ther, although the <HI>King</HI> would giue them all the treasure that hee had, but onely intended to serue and helpe the Qu&eacute;ene <HI>Lauinia,</HI> for that it seemed vnto them that sh&eacute;e had most right, without speaking any word vnto the <HI>King</HI> tourned about their hor|ses, and tooke their way towardes a great bridge of stone, which passed ouer the riuer, and at the farther end therof was the gate of the Citie, and vpon the said brige and wal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> of the Citie there were many people, and because the campe was very nigh the citie, they might well discerne all that had passed with the thr&eacute;e <HI>Princes,</HI> and what they had done,
<PB N="50" REF="55" MS="y">
and very much meruailed to what purpose it was done, and could not imagine who those thr&eacute;e valiant <HI>knights</HI> should be.</P>
<P>Now when the <HI>King Balachia</HI> saw that the thr&eacute;e <HI>Prin|ces</HI> went their way, with great wrath &amp; anger he began to cry out with a loude voice vnto his <HI>knights</HI> commaunding them to take them perforce. At which commandement ma|ny of his <HI>Knightes</HI> did follow them with as great spe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">d as their horses could run, but before they could ouertake them, these three <HI>Princes,</HI> were entred vpon the bridge. And when they saw so many people following the~ they drew out their swords &amp; turned backe vpon them. And wounded many of them. But by reason of the great company that assualted them, they were put to great extremitie, &amp; forced to retire backewards towards the citie. And by reason that the bridge was somwhat narow, it did profit them very much in that their enimies could not assault them but all before, to whom they did very great harme. This battaile indured betwixt them more then halfe an houre, in which time they slew of their enemies more then twentie <HI>Knights.</HI> And when those which were within the citie saw all that passed, they thought it best to open the gates vnto those <HI>Knights,</HI> that so valiant|ly &amp; with great strength defended themselues, &amp; determined to retaine them, on their part, to help them to make defence against their enimies, for that they did withdraw them|selues towards the Citie.</P>
<P>This determination they performed for as these thr&eacute;e <HI>Princes</HI> did by little and little retire towards the gates of the citie, so when they came nigh them, they that were vp|on the walles and battilments of the citie, did shoote many arrowes, and threw stones, and other things at their eni|mies, with the which they did them very great harme, and made them to retire backwards, by reason whereof they had space for to open a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> doore of the Gates, by the which the thr&eacute;e <HI>Princes</HI> entered in, and the Poster<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> againe they of the citie receiued them very w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">l,

and gaue them good intertainment, and much meruailed at their great valour &amp; strength, &amp; the <HI>Princes</HI> with like curte|sie did returne them thankes for that which they had done, and that in their defence they would doe all that euer was in their powers. There was amongst these people a <HI>knight</HI> who was principall of them, &amp; had the charge ouer that gate, and this <HI>Knight</HI> carryed the three <HI>Princes</HI> before the Qu&eacute;ene <HI>Lauinia,</HI> accompanied with many other <HI>knights</HI> &amp; <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> and when they came before hir, they gaue hir to vnderstand of all that they had seene those three <HI>knights</HI> doe, &amp; how they came of their owne good will to serue hir in hir wars. The Qu&eacute;ene when she heard that which the <HI>knight</HI> had told hir, receiued great ioy in their gentle disposition &amp; good propor|tion, receiuing them very curteously, and doing them all the honour she could, &amp; offering hir selfe wholy vnto them, &amp; like&punc; did aduertise them of the small reason that the <HI>King</HI> had to besiege them. These <HI>Princes</HI> answered hir with wonted cur|tesie, and did offer themselues vnto the Qu&eacute;ene so liberally that she was almost satisfied of the sauegard of hir citie. Then they remayned ther all that day without doing any other thing, and the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Balachia</HI> remayned in his camp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> with great anger and sorrowfull heauinesse, that those thr&eacute;e <HI>Knights</HI> were gone from him in that order, and did sweare a mightie oath that he would make them die an euill death, if he might get them into his power. And although h&eacute;e had, at this present great wrath against them, ther did not passe very long time after, but that they did grieue him much more, and made him repent himself for that he did not giue them better intertainment, when they first entred into his campe, as in this chapter following shall be told you.</P>

<P>In the foreward went these three mightie and worthy <HI>Princes,</HI> and all the rest when they saw them so mightie and well proporcioned of members, and very stout, receyued great courage.

<P><PB REF="57">So when the <HI>King</HI> saw this great destruction which the thr&eacute;e <HI>Knights</HI> made amongst his <HI>Knights,</HI> he pulled himselfe by the beard, and blasphemed against himselfe, for that when he had them in his tent, he dyd not co~maund that they should be taken &amp; put to a cruell death.

And ha|uing determined with himselfe what was best to be done, he commaunded to call vnto him the <HI>Gyant</HI> whose name was <HI>Fulgoso,</HI> &amp; when he came before him he sayd, doe thus which I commaund thee, choose in all the whole campe a thousand <HI>knights</HI> of the best thou canst finde, and in a readinesse with them, &amp; when thou dost see our enimies come forth of the ci|tie, thou &amp; all these <HI>knights</HI> shall haue no other charge, but to take the three <HI>knights</HI> which went from hence, and bring them prisoners before mee: for that I doe s&eacute;e that in those three onely resteth the force &amp; strength of our enimies.

And so he departed from the king, &amp; began to choose out the <HI>knights</HI> that should serue his turne for that attempt, and vnto euery one perticularly he gaue his charge what he should doe. So they were all in a readinesse, tarying the time, when their enemies should come forth. And all the rest of the souldiers were continually in very good order, verye destrous to be reuenged, of the harme which they had before receiued. When the next morning was come, these thr&eacute;e Princes had great desire to finish that which they had b&eacute;e|gunne, for that they would follow &amp; proserute their enter|prise: wherfore they determined to goe forth of the citie as they did the day before.

In this sort indured the battaile more then one houre, and all things went well with them of the Citie, but sodeinly came vpon them the Gyaunt <HI>Ful|goso</HI> with his thousand knights, and for that they hadde no other charge but to take these thr&eacute;e Princes, they straight waies compassed the~ about, in such sort that not one of their companie could come nigh them by a great space. Then this mightie Gyaunt b&eacute;egan the battayle alone with these three knights, for that according vnto his force and strength they had mough to doe with him, &amp; in the meane time that they were in battaile with the Gyaunt, the knights of the Gyaunt did kill their horses, and in falling vnto the ground they all together charged themselues vpon them, and with the help of the Gyaunt they were not able to make any re|sistance, neither was theyr great prowesse and strength suf|ficient to defend themselues, but that they must n&eacute;edes b&eacute;e taken prisoners. When they tooke away theyr swords, and pulled of their Helmes, and carried them b&eacute;efore the king, who was in his Tent, very ioyfull when hee saw them brought prisoners. And by reason that the three princes did lack in the battaile, those of the Citie could not make any farther resistance against their aduersaries, and therefore they did retire in the best wise they could into the Citie, and when they found missing in their companie the thr&eacute;e knights, and vnderstoode that they were prisoners, I am not able to declare their great sorrow and griefe which they receiued, for that b&eacute;esides the loue they bare them, they ho|ped also by their help to make defence against theyr foes, and if theyr absence and lacke was left amongst the com|mon people, much more was the griefe that the Qu&eacute;ene <HI>La|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ima</HI> and hir Daughter receiued when they heard that sor|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">owful newes, so that it seemed that they were past all hope

The loue of these Princes was so much the one vnto the other, and their great valour and bountie was so apparant amongst them, that they receiued as great griefe the one for the other, as though it had b&eacute;ene perticularly to each of the~, and either of them desired to dye for to saue the other two of his companions. So when they had trauailed from the campe the space of two miles, they passed by the foote of a smal mountaine, and when these thr&eacute;e Princes lift vp their eyes for to b&eacute;ehould that Mountayne, they saw descending from the top thereof a knight of a mighty stature of his bo|die, and of a good disposition, verie well armed and moun|ted

And beeing demaunded of them who h&eacute;e was, for that they might know him of whom they had receiued so great a benefit h&eacute;e answered them that h&eacute;e was a strange knight of that Country, and that he could not discouer nor tel vnto them his name, till such time as h&eacute;e had finished a iourney which he had taken in hand, but if they were desirous to re|turne and aide the qu&eacute;ene <HI>Lauinia,</HI> h&eacute;e would goe with them and beare them company, and doe for hir all that lay in his power. When the thr&eacute;e Princes heard him say those words they were very glad and ioyfull, for that theyr whole de|sire was to returne vnto the Cittie, as well for the succour of the Qu&eacute;ene <HI>Lauinia</HI> and hir daughter, as to bee reuenged on their aduersaries, as of the king of <HI>Balachia,</HI> for that they were verie angrie and wrathfull against him, and b&eacute;ehol|ding often and verie much that knight, how hee was ador|ned with all bountie, they said one vnto another, that in all things h&eacute;e resembled <HI>Rosicleer,</HI> as well in his great valour as in the gentle disposition of his body, and in all the rest of his behauiour, and calling him to remembraunce, and how that they could not heare any newes of him, the teares ran from the eyes of either of them for the loue they bare vnto him.

At this present the Knight of <HI>Cupide</HI> receiued great sorrow and

griefe, in s&eacute;eing that those thr&eacute;e Princes b&eacute;eing of so great valour went in his demaund, and that occasion did so serue, that h&eacute;e could not discouer himselfe vnto them. H&eacute;ere may you plainely perceiue what the discurtesie of the Princesse <HI>Oliuia</HI> did cause, for that it caused him to withdraw fro~ him the&punc; great pleasure and contentment that h&eacute;e should receiue in discouering himselfe vnto his friends. So after that they had talked of these and other like things, the thr&eacute;e Princes tooke each of them a horse o? those knights that were slaine, and they foure together tooke their way towards the Citie, although by the counsaile of the tartarian <HI>Zoylo</HI> they went not the right way, suspecting that when the king of <HI>Balachia</HI> should vnderstand of the death of the Gyant, hee would send some people against the~, but their determination was not to be s&eacute;ene til such time as they were come nigh vnto y^e camp, and then put themselues into the Citie if neede so required, and in this sort although the King did send his power they should not meete with them, but that they might much more at their plesure come nigh the camp of their contraries, and consulting amongst themselues what was best for them to doo, they determined to giue the assault vpon their enimies sodainely, and to prease through them till such time as they might get the Bridge, and b&eacute;eing there they were very cer|taine that when those of the Cittie should s&eacute;e them, they would issue foorth and succour them, or at the least waies they would open the gates that they might enter in, and looke as they had determined they did put in practise, and all these foure together dyd enter into the Camp of theyr eni|mies, cutting, wounding, and killing, that it was a wonder to see the great effusion which they made amongest them, and neuer rested til such time as they came vnto the bridge, whereas they dyd defend themselues very, valia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ntly, from them that followed them, where those of the Cittie did s&eacute;e all that passed.</P>
<P>And when they knew that those worthy Knights were their friends, they were very glad and reioyced to s&eacute;e them,
<PB REF="69">
and did open vnto them the gates of the Citie, &amp; very much meruailed at the other knight that c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">me with y^e three prin|ces, for that they saw the great slaughter which hee made amongst his enimies with his sword in his hand, and whe~ these soure Knights saw the gates of the Citie opened, they did retire by little &amp; little vpon the bridge, vntill such time as their enimies dyd leaue off following them, as well for the mortall blowes they gaue them, as for the great harme they receiued by them which were vppon the walles of the Citie, so that they had time at their pleasure to enter into the Cittie, and when they were within they shut the gates, and receiued them with great ioye, and carried them beefore the Queene, whose ioy was so great for the returne of these three Princes&punc; that I am not able to expresse it, for that hir comfort and hope that shee had in them was very much, and theyr imprisonment was a grieuous corsie vnto hir heart. So there they did repose &amp; rest themselues all that day, and all the next following, with a great deale more ioy then at any time beefore. The next day b&eacute;eing come the knight of <HI>Cupide</HI> and the thr&eacute;e Princes commaunded that all such people as they thought could doe any thing to arme them|selues vnto the battaile, and so in very good order they went forth into the field against their enimies, and ouercame and brake the Campe and slew the King, and the most part of those that were with him, and the rest ranne theyr way, so that those of <HI>Lusitania</HI> remained with the victorie, and pur|sued theyr enimies till such time as the night dyd with|draw them backe, and made them to retire, and it was a thing to be wondered at, to see the great feates and deeds of armes that the knight of <HI>Cupide</HI> did that day, for it may bee sayde, that hee alone was the occasion of breaking vp of the Camp of their enimies, and the destruction of all the whole armie of the king of <HI>Balachia,</HI> so that on the one part as w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> as one the other, they verie much meruayled of the incri|dyble d&eacute;edes which they saw done in that battaile.

With these sorrowfull thoughts that night h&eacute;e trauailed so long that h&eacute;e came vnto the sea, &amp; the next day in the morning, h&eacute;e entered into a Ship of mer|chandise, which ariued at that place to refresh themselues with fresh water, and were bound vnto <HI>Alexandria.</HI> Now to returne vnto the thr&eacute;e Princes, the Historie saith that at such time as they had gathered theyr people together, and would haue entered into the Citie, they found wanting the knight of <HI>Cupide,</HI> and b&eacute;eing very sorrowfull for his absence they went s&eacute;eking him, and asking for him of all that they met, till such time as they came to the knight, with whom the knight of <HI>Cupide</HI> had talked, and he tolde vnto them his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">mbassage and all that hee had sayd vnto him.

him to b&eacute;e very fruitfull, fresh, and pleasant, h&eacute;e determined with himself to see the countrie in the meane time that the marriners did trim their ship, &amp; make prouision of all that was necessarie, and so h&eacute;e tooke his horse &amp; went alone from the port, taking the way which led him vnto a mighty great Citie that was but sixe miles from that port. And when he had trauailed two miles fro~ the port, hee saw a far of from him in the same high way where h&eacute;e went, a great number of Knights, which seemed vnto him that they were in bat|taile they so beesturred themselues, and therewith h&eacute;e did a|mend his pace to know what it should meane, and when he came nigh vnto them, h&eacute;e saw that it was more them twen|tie knights who had compassed about one alone Knight, who was a of a very big stature, and armed with blackarmour, who made battaile with them all, and did defend himself ve|rie stoutly and strongly, and had ouerthrowen wounded to the ground sixe of them, so that h&eacute;e s&eacute;emed to b&eacute;e a valyant Knight and of good estimation. When the Knight of <HI>Cupide</HI> had well marked him, and saw him so valiantly defend him|selfe, he receiued great contentment, and determined to suc|cor him in that conflict, perswading him that the truth and right was on his part, for that there was so manie against one, and without any more tarrying h&eacute;e set spurres to his Horse sides, and with his Sword in his hand h&eacute;e put him|selfe in the middest of them that had compassed him about, and before that hee stroke any blow h&eacute;e sayd.

All of them did well heare and vnderstand what he sayd, but the answere which they made vnto him, was, that they all stroke at him, as they which made no reckoning of him, which was a sorrowfull houre for some of them, for that when the knight of <HI>Cupid</HI> dyd s&eacute;e their villanie, his anger dyd presently increase, and he lift vp his strong arme and stroke one of them vpon y^e healme, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e cloue his head downe to his shoulders, so that he fel from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">is horse dead to the earth, &amp; he was scarce downe when the

When this mightie knight who first made battaile with them all, saw himselfe succoured and aided in that time as hee thought his life to b&eacute;e lost, h&eacute;e receiued great ioy and contentment, and was very much amazed to s&eacute;e the straunge curtesie of that Knight, and the furious strokes which hee gaue vnto his contraries, the which was such, that if h&eacute;e had not seene it with his owne eyes hee would neuer haue beel&eacute;eued it, and with that new and vnlooked for aide &amp; succour, his strength and courage did so increase, that he stroke such a blow vpon the arme of one of them that was next him, that hee cut it cleane a sunder, and it fell to the ground holding his sh&eacute;elde fast and h&eacute;e stroke another vpon the head that h&eacute;e cloue it to the eyes, and ouerthrew him from his horse to the ground, so that afterward they could not strike any more blows, for that the rest of the Knights s&eacute;eing the great slaughter and effusion of blood which those two Knights made, thought their liues in small securitie, and fled away with all the hast they could, b&eacute;eing to the number of sixe or seauen knights, so that these two valiaunt knights were left alone, &amp; when the knight with the black armour saw himselfe cl&eacute;ere from his contraries, h&eacute;e lift vp his beauer and went vnto the knight of <HI>Cupide,</HI> saying.</P>

So the third day at such time as the Sunne was about an houre high, trauailing without anie care by a forrest, which seemed to be a more quiet &amp; peacea|ble Country then that which they had before trauailed in. Upon a sodaine their horses started, &amp; their haire began to stand vpright, &amp; they were afraide, &amp; braied &amp; snorted in such sort, that they could not make them proc&eacute;ede forwarde, and looking about them towards euery side, to s&eacute;e what it should be that caused the same, &amp; on a sodaine ther came forth of the most thickest of the Forrest two great sauage &amp; wild men, who in the bignesse of their bodies seemed to be giants, who were mounted vpon two Lions very furious, which serued them for horses, without any bridle or other kinde of thing, but they had each of them in their handes a mighty great, heauie, &amp; knotted club, with the which they did gouerne their Lions to goe what way it pleased them, and when they had discouered the two knights, they went towards them, and when they approched them, the feare was so great that their horses receiued, that all the pollicie and strength which the knights could vse, was not sufficient to make them goe to|wards the sauage men. So before they could haue leasure to alight from their horses, these sauages were come vnto the~, vpon their tamed Lions, and finding the knights with their backes towards them, for that their horses did cast them|selues about, they stroke them with their knottie clubbes two such blowes vpon their fiue and st&eacute;elie healmes, with

so great strength, that they made them stoupe forwardes with theyr breasts vpon the saddle bowes, b&eacute;eing somewhat amazed. And b&eacute;efore that they could come well againe to themselues, these sauages stroke them other two blowes that brought them out of their remembraunces, and there|with they tooke them in their armes from theyr horses, and carryed them into the thickest of that forrest, and they had not borne them far, but they came vnto a verie great foun|tayne, which s&eacute;emed to b&eacute;e in the manner of a cesterne, and the water was as cleere as Christal, but it was of so great depth, that it seemed to haue no bottome. When they were come thether, these wilde men dyd lay the two knights vp|pon the ground without any remembraunce as they were beefore, and alighting from their lyons, they made them fast vnto two Tr&eacute;es there by, and straight way they b&eacute;egan to giue terrible and mightie blaringes and shrikes, such as might b&eacute;e heard a great way, at which noise in a short time there was gathered together about that Fountaine more then twentie sauages, such as they were, some riding vpon Wolues, and other some vpon other wilde beasts, some of them which came nigh vnto the knights whereas they lay, dyd labour and trauaile all that euer they could to vnarme them, &amp; for that they were not expert in the vse of armour, they dyd nothing but tumble them vp and downe from the one side to the other, and could not finde which way to get of theyr armour.

<P><PB N="72" REF="78">When the king <HI>Sacridoro</HI> vnderstood that those thr&eacute;e Knights were friends vnto the Knight of <HI>Cupide,</HI> h&eacute;e re|ceiued a new sorrow and griefe in his heart, to s&eacute;e them la|ment &amp; sorrow for his death, and with this great rage and mortall anguish h&eacute;e went vnto the Fountaine, and standing vpon his feete hee dyd beehold the profound deepenesse of the water, &amp; thr&eacute;e times h&eacute;e was ready to throw himselfe ther|in, and many times hee retired back againe, but in the ende (the wise <HI>Artemidoro</HI> saith) that h&eacute;e said these words: Oh worthy and valyant knight of <HI>Cupide,</HI> s&eacute;eing that my cru|ell destinie will not permit that in lyfe time I cannot en|ioye thy company and friendshippe, my death shall now follow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">hine, and one Sepulcher shal possesse both thy bones and mine.

<P>_AFter that the mightie <HI>Alphoebo</HI> was de|parted from the bridge whereas hee had the battaile with <HI>Florinaldus,</HI> and his knights, the historie saith that in few daies he entered in|to the Empire of <HI>Grecia,</HI> vpon that side which is beetwixt <HI>Dardenie</HI> and <HI>Macedonia</HI> and tra|uailing certaine daies in that Countrie, h&eacute;e alwaies kept his right way towards <HI>Constantinople.</HI> So it happened vp|on a day as he trauailed by a broad &amp; vsed way which went from one Citie to another, at such time as the greatest force<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> of the Sunne was ouerpassed, hee saw in the same way com|ming towards him a great multitude of people, and the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> part of the~ seemed to be <HI>Gentlewomen,</HI> amongst whom the seemed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">o be armed giants, and as they came a far of, it hap|pened to b&eacute;e a thing of great maiestie and highnesse, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> knight of the sun being very destrous to know who it shal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> bee, did put himselfe somwhat out of the way on Horseba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> as h&eacute;e was, and stoode still, and tarried till all that peop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> should passe by, for that all things in that Countrie seem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> very straunge vnto him, and likewise at this time a thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> greatly to bee meruailed at, for although hee could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">|iecture with him what occasion should moue him to be tro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">|bled, yet he f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">it within himselfe a great weaknes, as thou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">

And vnder the same was ther wrought with gold two arkes, the one ioyning to the other, of so excellent and rich worke, that according to the great &amp; sumptuous riches, ther was neuer Emperour of <HI>Rome</HI> in his most triumph that had the like arks made vnto him, and vnder the same arkes there was two chaires, all of gold &amp; precious stones, &amp; in one of those chaires there sate a Damsell, that according vnto the great maiestie &amp; beautie which she had, s&eacute;emed to be some ce|lestiall creature come downe from the heauens. And it is not to be bel&eacute;eued that <HI>Helena,</HI> for whom there were stayne so many thousandes of Gr&eacute;ekes &amp; Troyans, was so fayre as she. Thiy Damsell was apparailed in a roabe of cloth of golde, all set full of fiue Sapheres, with very faire &amp; strange worke, &amp; she had vpon hir head a call made of Emeraudes, in maner of a net, through the which hir yeolow haire was s&eacute;ene, that it s&eacute;emed to b&eacute;e thirde of fine golde, and for that she was as white as Snow, she s&eacute;emed of so great beautie, that no humane vnderstanding was able to comprehende the same. Under the other arke hard by that, ther sate in the chaire, a knight all armed sauing his head, of a high sta|ture and well made, his face was very faire and of a good and gentle proportion, and his armour was so strange and rich, that the line was neuer s&eacute;ene in the world, for that it was made all of scales of fish, which is in the Athlantike sea, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">d as white as milke, and as hard as any Diamond, and all the ioynts and lasings thereof was garnished with very fine golde and precious stones, wrought very strange|lie, &amp; beside that, they were of much more force, then if they had bene of fine steele, (and tempered by art magicke) they were so straunge and faire in shew, that any king or Em|perour of high estate would gladlie desire to haue the like. H&eacute;e hadde also a swoord at his girdle girt vnto him, the hangers and the scabbard were all of fine golde, and the pommell and ball was of a fine Emeraude. He hadd vp|pon his head a Hat of gr&eacute;ene Silke, all full of small Ru|bies, and hadde a very faire brouch in it. And for that h&eacute;e
<PB N="74" REF="80">
was white and faire of face, it did b&eacute;ecome him meruay|lously well: he carried his arme&punc; vppon the chaire, &amp; leaned his head on his hand lookeing downewards w^t his eies some|what with a sad countenaunce, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> seemed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ee had some care, and at the feete of this knight &amp; of the Damsell that sat by him, ther sat si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e Gentlewomen, all apa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ailed in cloth of s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">uer, brodered with very straunge &amp; rich worke of gold &amp; stones, who were crowned with crownes of gold vpon their heads like vnto Queenes, &amp; had in their hands certaine in|struments in forme of Lutes, with the which they made ve|ry sw&eacute;ete musicke.

In this sort did this triumphant Cha|riot passe by the knight of the <HI>Sun,</HI> with so great a maiestie and high estate, that it was very meruailous &amp; straunge to beholde.</Q> When the knight of the Sunne had well behelde all that passed by him, and had contemplated himselfe in beholding that faire Damsell which sate by the knight, h&eacute;e thought verily that he had ioyed in some celestiall and di|nine vision. So when the Chariot was passed by and out of sight, he remayned as one blinde and astonied, euen as the Sunne vppon a sodaine should loose hir light, or as if the day should b&eacute;e tourned to night: Euen so didde h&eacute;e remaine as one halfe amazed for a while, and as one that had not knowen what had passed, and for that h&eacute;e would the more better satisfie himselfe of that which he had s&eacute;ene, as one which still remayned in a great doubt, h&eacute;e bro|ched his Horse with the spurs and rode before the chariot,
<PB REF="81">
and staied himselfe till such time as they should passe by him againe. Now when he saw that Damsell, &amp; had contempla|ted on that strange &amp; soueraigne beautie, straight way his hard &amp; strong hart that neuer was ouercome by loue, was in such sort wounded, that of long time after many &amp; diffi|cult remedies were sought to heale that cankering wound, and he that no humane power was sufficient to moue out of his saddle, was by the shew of that faire sight so troubled in his vnder standing, that his strength failed him, in such sort, that if his Page <HI>Bynnano</HI> had not ben, who did very well perceius his perturbation, and staied him, otherwise as one without anie remembraunce he had fallen downe to the ground, but his Page <HI>Bynnano</HI> very quicklie came to his Lord the knight of the <HI>Sun,</HI> &amp; held him fast in his armes with all his strength hee could, saying: What is this my Lord that before this faire company you doe shew your selfe so feeble &amp; weake: Unto which the knight of the <HI>Sun</HI> did aun|swere neuer a word, but as one amazed &amp; astomed he knew not what to say. In the meane time the damsells which rode before the Cahriot on their Unicornes, did very much bee|hold the kinght of the Sunne, &amp; he seemed vnto them that he was the best proportioned knight that euer they had seene, &amp; one of these damsells who seemed to be more pittifull then all the rest, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> his great alteration, &amp; how his Page did su|staine him in his armes, supposing that h&eacute;e had beene in a sound, she let the Chariot passe forward &amp; came where the knight of the Sunne was, &amp; said vnto his Pages: Brethe|ren, I pray you tel me what is the sicknesse of this knight, for that it seemeth to me he is in a sound.</P>
<P>The Knight of the Sunne when he saw the Damsell, of whom he might informe himselfe of that which he so much destred, comming somewhat vnto himselfe answered hir and sayde.</P>

but now s&eacute;eing it hath ben your pleasure to haue some care ouer me, I doe most hartelie desire you to declare vnto me what they are that ride in that Chariot, &amp; whether they are going in such triumphant sort, for it may so fall out, in the meane time that you doe giue me to vnderstand therof, this my sicknesse will leaue me, &amp; heerein I shall be much bound vnto you, and if I may require that courtesie. The damsell who receiued great contentment in his company said: Of a truth sir knight, although it will be somewhat tedious to declare vnto you all this which you doe demaund of me, yet I will tell it you with a very good will, for that your beha|uiour doth deserue that I accomplish this, yea, &amp; much more for you. The knight of the Sun did giue hir great thankes for hir gentle offer, &amp; she began to tell vnto him that which was his desire, saying.</P>
<P><Q>You shall vnderstand sir Knight, that in the <HI>Gran Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">aia</HI> within the Orient all Regions owelleth an high and migh|tie Lord called <HI>Alicandro,</HI> who is Emperour of <HI>Tartaria</HI> the great, and of the <HI>Scitiha,</HI> and Lord ouer all the Ilands <HI>Ori|entales</HI> and <HI>Meridionales,</HI> who by his mightie power hath brought in subiection almost all the kings &amp; mightie Lords of <HI>Asia,</HI> for the which hee is called the mightie Emperour king of kings and Lord of Lordes, and commeth of the li|nage of the diuine Gods, whome we doe honour &amp; worship, for which cause all we that by his vassals &amp; subiects haue him in more reputation then any humane creature. This migh|tie Emperour when he was a young man was married vn|to a damsell, who for hir great bountie &amp; beauty was had in reputation for a deuine Goddesse, and b&eacute;eing with childe by the Emperour, when hir time was come, she was dely|uered at one birth of a sonne and a daughter, which be those two that are in the Chariot vnder the two rich arkes, and the Damsell is called <HI>Lindabrides,</HI> and the Knight <HI>Meri|dian,</HI> and as you s&eacute;e hir without comparison faire and beau|tifull so is he, neither more nor lesse without comparison in armes, for that in those partes there was neuer s&eacute;ene
<PB REF="82">
knight of so much strength that could compare himself with him, &amp; it is to be supposed that <HI>Iupiter</HI> was neuer so mightie &amp; strong as he is, of whom he is reported to descend. So when these two Princes came vnto age, ther was a great conten|tion amongst the kings &amp; mightie Lords, subiects vnto the Emperour, which of these two should be sworne for <HI>Prince</HI> &amp; soueraigne ruler of that great estate &amp; empresse, after the death of the emperour, for that in those countries as wel the daughter as the Baron, if she be first borne, doth succ&eacute;ede in the kingdome, and this controuersie was not onely amongst the subiects, but also betwixt the Emperour &amp; Empresse, for that the Empresse did loue least the Prince <HI>Meridian,</HI> &amp; the Emperor did affect most the Princesse <HI>Lindabrides,</HI> &amp; was ve|ry desirous that she might succ&eacute;ed him in his estate, &amp; in the meane time that this contention endured amongst them, the Emperour commanded to call together all the wise men as could be found in art magicke, &amp; these he charged that they should giue their iudgement, &amp; prognosticate vpon the succes|sion of these two Princes, &amp; to declare which of them would best reserue his diuine linage, &amp; his high consecrated estate. Now all these wise men gaue their iudgement, &amp; in the end of many daies the most part of them, especially the wisest, did ioyntlie conclude, that by the off-spring of the Princesse the Tartarian Princesse shoule be exalted, and the linage of the Emperour should be by hir better reserued, for that they found how a knight in a nother Empire in <HI>Europe</HI> should marrie with hir, who should come to b&eacute;e the most highest &amp; puisaunt Prince in all the world, of whome should succ&eacute;ede very famous knights. Other wise men ther were which did prognosticate the contrary, &amp; said that the Princesse would be the occasion that that high &amp; mightie estate should be de|stroyed &amp; ouerthrowen, &amp; that hir wedding should be lamen|ted in all <HI>Asia,</HI> much more then the wedding was that was made with <HI>Helena,</HI> &amp; the sonne of <HI>Priamus.</HI> When the Em|perour &amp; all his nobles did s&eacute;e the great controuersie betwixt
<PB N="76" REF="82">
the wise men, &amp; well vnderstood their iudgements &amp; prognos|tications, they came to a conclusion betwixt themselues, &amp; did determine that the Prince <HI>Meridian</HI> and the Princesse <HI>Lindabrides</HI> should come in this sort as you haue s&eacute;ene into this great Empire of <HI>Grecia,</HI> for that they found that there was no other Empire in all <HI>Europe,</HI> &amp; that they should tra|uaile through all the kingdomes &amp; prouinces in the Empire. And if it be so y^t the princesse <HI>Lindabrides</HI> did finde a knight that could ouercome the Prince <HI>Meridian</HI> in battaile, that he should enter into the Chariot &amp; sit downe in the Prin|cesse chaire, &amp; that afterward he should defend hir great &amp; excellent beautie for the space of thr&eacute;e moneths, in the court of the Emperour, &amp; if in the meane time he found not a knght that could ouercome him, that then he should returne with the Princesse to the court of the Emperour <HI>Alicandro,</HI> and ther he shall be married vnto hir, &amp; made heire of that great Empire. And if it be so that the Prince <HI>Meridian</HI> do trauaile through all these kingdomes &amp; Prouinces, &amp; finde neuer a knight that can ouercome &amp; get the victorie of him in bat|tell, that then he should remaine for prince &amp; successour of all the great estate of that empire, &amp; the like preferment should be giuen vnto him, whosoeuer should ouercome him that o|uercame the Princesse. And this we holde for certainty that the prince <HI>Meridian</HI> shall remaine with the Emperor, or els he that shall succ&eacute;ed him, shal be the best knight that is to be found in all the world. And in this sort it s&eacute;emed best vnto y^e Emperour &amp; all his nobles to appease the controuersie, and the best way that the truest prognostication should come to effect. So the emperour &amp; the empresse being very well con|tent h&eacute;ere with, commanded that this chariot of triumph to be made, with the maiestie which you haue s&eacute;ene, so that it is now two moneths since we entred into the Empire of <HI>Gre|cia,</HI> &amp; we haue passed <HI>Dalmasia</HI> &amp; <HI>Dardania,</HI> and <HI>Missia, Thes|salia, Macedonia</HI> and <HI>Archadia,</HI> and other Prouinces, in the which the Prince hath had manye battailes. And as
<PB REF="83">
yet he could neuer finde knight, but that he ouercame him, &amp; had the victorie with great ease, but now he is very sad and heauie, as one that hath some great care, for that comming vnto the court of the King of <HI>Macedonia,</HI> after he had ouer|come the Prince &amp; many other knights he was striken with the loue of the Princesse <HI>Florabindia,</HI> daughter vnto the king of <HI>Macedonia,</HI> who is the fairest damsell that euer I saw in all my life, except the Princesse <HI>Lindabrides,</HI> our Lady &amp; mi|stres, &amp; now the way w&eacute;e take is towards <HI>Constantinople,</HI> for that it hath bene told vs that ther are ioyned together the most highest Princes &amp; valiantest knights of all the em|pire. Wheras our prince Meridian may the better shew his great bountie, for that according as he is of might &amp; power, I doe bel&eacute;eue the Gr&eacute;ekes shall haue inough to talk of him all the daies of ther liues.</Q></P>
<P>Now h&eacute;ere haue I told vnto you gentle knight, all your desire, therefore I commit you to the Gods, and I will de|part, the Chariot is gone a great way before, therefore par|don m&eacute;e, for I cannot tarrie any longer. And in saying these wordes this damsell departed vppon hir Unicorne, and the knight of the Sunne remained very much amazed at that so straunge an aduenture, and was very glad and reioyced within himselfe for that his sicknesse might haue some re|medie, although he thought that he was not worthie of so great a benefit, yet he had heart and stomacke to giue the attempt vnto a thing of greater importaunce, and did lit|tle est&eacute;eme any knight in the whole world, and yet h&eacute;e had no courage to conceiue that he was worthie to come to so high an estate, and so h&eacute;e remained amazed a good while, and by reason that his new sicknesse did trouble him verie much, he lacked vnderstanding to direct him in what h&eacute;e had to doe, till within a while after he came vnto himselfe, and broched his Horse with his spurres, h&eacute;e rode forwards and saide. What is this, wherevpon doe I stay, for that I s&eacute;e it is impossible for mee to liue, if I left to comfort my selfe with the diuine beautie and sight of the Princesse? And
<PB N="77" REF="83">
with this he put himselfe before the chariot with great good will to speake vnto the Prince <HI>Meridian,</HI> and as h&eacute;e turned his horse for to b&eacute;eholde that faire face of the Princesse, his tongue fayled him, and as one boyde of reason and vnder|standing h&eacute;e stood still with his horse, without speaking any word, till such time as the chariot was passed by and gone a great way. So when the knight of the Sunne was come againe vnto his remembrance, hee b&eacute;egan to bee angry with himselfe, for that h&eacute;e s&eacute;emed to b&eacute;e of so smal a courage, and striking his horse once againe with the spurs, h&eacute;e ouer tooke the triumphant Chariot, and putting himselfe b&eacute;efort it, h&eacute;e commaunded the dwarfes to stay the Unicornes, and com|ming as nigh as euer hee could vnto the Prince &amp; the prin|cesse, with a troubled voyce h&eacute;e sayd these words.</P>
<P><Q>The diuine Gods b&eacute;e in your gard and k&eacute;eping, mightie and worthie Prince of the <HI>Scithians,</HI> by one of your Dam|sels I doo vnderstand the manner and occasion of your com|ming hether into this Countrie b&eacute;eing so far from yours, and although I thinke my selfe vnworthie of so high a re|compence as is granted vnto him that shall ouercome you, yet m&eacute;e thinkes by all reason I am bound to answere in the iustice of this soueraigne Princesse <HI>Lyndabrides,</HI> for that according vnto hir great beautie, sh&eacute;e deserueth to b&eacute;e Lady and Gouernesse, not onely of the Emperour of the <HI>Scythi|ans,</HI> but of all the whole world, certainly I had rather serue you and bee at your commaundement, then giue occasion of your discontentment, but s&eacute;eing that it canot be done by any other menaes, I desire you y^t you wold take it in good part, that in consideration thereof w&eacute;e may enter in the battell, and pardon this my enterprise, for that surelie it doth not proceede so much of the confidence that I haue of mine owne power and strength, as it doth by the dutie I owe vnto so diuine and soueraigne a Princesse.</Q></P>

downe, and receiuing no lesse delight at his words, then at his gentle disposition, with a great and seuere counte|nance, h&eacute;e answered him, saying:</P>
<P>Sir Knight, I doe gratifie very much your courteous words, as well for them as for your gentle disposition. And I doo certainely bel&eacute;eue, that your bountie cannot be small. And the battaile which you doo demaund of m&eacute;e, I accept for that I come for no other thing in this sort and manner as you s&eacute;e. And in saying these words, h&eacute;e arose from the chaire whereas h&eacute;e sat. And straight way two of these Gyaunts which went a foote, entered in, vnder the Chariot, &amp; brought foorth there a horse, the most fayrest and strongest that euer was s&eacute;ene: and somewhat disforming from other horses, for that he had his body very bigge, and the hinmost halfe was all as blacke as any Ieate, and the halfe forwards was as white as the driuen snow, his head was very little, and in the midst of his forehead was there a little horne like vnto an Unicorne: and in his legges h&eacute;e had foure ioynts, for which cause h&eacute;e was very light, and did runne as swift and quick as the winde, and as yet there was neuer Horse that could ouertake him, and some saide that this Horse was in|gendered of a mare and a Unicorne, the which they affirme for certainty, as well for his forme and making, as for that they haue in that Countrie of <HI>Scythia</HI> &amp; <HI>Tartaria</HI> many U|nicornes, and oftentimes they are s&eacute;ene in the fields f&eacute;eding with the Mares. To conclude, this horse as well in his strength as in his swiftnesse was the best Horse that euer was s&eacute;ene, and was called <HI>Cornerino,</HI> by reason of the horne that h&eacute;e had in his forehead.</P>
<P>They brought him foorth all couered with cloth of golde, and with a bush of white feathers on his head, and all his Saddle was enameled, and brodered about with Orien|tall Pearles, the styroppes were of fine golde, and his bri|dle and all the other trappinges were of fine golde and silke, and for that the Horse was very great and faire, and his furniture so rich, certainely h&eacute;e s&eacute;emed to b&eacute;e the Horse
<PB N="78" REF="84" MS="y">
of some mightie Prince. So this worthie Prince <HI>Meridian</HI> did mount vpon his horse, and it was a thing greatly to b&eacute;e mernailed at, to s&eacute;e him on horseback with that strange and rich armour that h&eacute;e brought with him, and his mighty and big proportion and gentle disposition dyd meruailously b&eacute;e|come him, and this worthie Knight of the Sunne reioyced very much to s&eacute;e him in that order, and had great content|ment to s&eacute;e him. But if this Prince <HI>Meridian</HI> did seeme so braue on horsebacke, what shall w&eacute;e say of that <HI>gran Al|phoebo,</HI> in whom all the proportion and gentle disposition of humane was comprehended, for vnto all them that dyd b&eacute;ehold him, h&eacute;e caused great admiration, and therewith h&eacute;e b&eacute;egan to mooue his Horse and to tourne him in the fielde, and the Prince <HI>Meridian</HI> did b&eacute;ehould him very well, and did straight way conceiue within himselfe, that it should b&eacute;e a Knight of great prowesse, for that b&eacute;efore h&eacute;e neuer saw a Knight better set and well made, and h&eacute;e tooke great pleasure to b&eacute;ehould him.</P>
<P>Likewise this beautifull and soueraigne Princesse was ouercome by that sodayne and vnlooked for sight, for in lifting vp with great maiestie hir gray and Christaline eyes, sh&eacute;e saw the Knight of Sunne and his goodly proporti|on and gallaunt demeanour, wherewith hir hart did so al|ter, that she bare him better good will, and had him in more estimation then any other knight that sh&eacute;e had s&eacute;ene. So these stout and valiaunt Knights did put themselues in a readinesse to the battaile, and what happened therein shall b&eacute;e tolde you in this Chapter following.</P>

<P>And when h&eacute;e had said these words, it s&eacute;emed vnto him his heart dyd reioyce and was verie much comforted. So straight way sixe of those Dwarfes which rode vpon the Unicornes that drew the Chariot dyd sound their Trum|pets, the which did make a verie great and timerous noyse, at the sound whereof these stout warriours did moue them|selues the one against the other, &amp; the great swiftnesse and furie of that Horse <HI>Cornerino</HI> was such, that it seemed hee

could not be s&eacute;ene in his swift course, and the ground vnder him, but although the horse of the knight of the Sunne was not so swift as hee, yet the great hast &amp; fury which his ma|ster vsed made him run with so great swiftnes, that almost in the midst of the course they did meete together, and the en|counter was so strong, that their mighty speares were shee|uered in such sort that the splinters slew into the aire, and these stout warriours did passe y^e one by the other, and ney|ther of them were mooued in their saddles, &amp; yet for all that it seemed that the great violence and force of their horses in their course was nothing abated, but with great lightnesse they turned them about, and these two knights gaue the as|sault one against another with their swords, and b&eacute;egan to strike in such furious sort, that they seemed to b&eacute;e all on fire, with y^e great abundance of sparkles which slew out of their armour, and throughout all the field was heard the great noise of their terrible blows, and many knights which tra|uayled in those partes came vnto that place to s&eacute;e what it should bee, and beeholding that terrible and well foughten battaile beetwixt those two knights, did stay as halfe amaz|ed thereat. This furious battaile beetwixt them did endure more then one houre, and there was no aduantage knowen then, and for that the armour of the Prince <HI>Meridian</HI> was the best in all y^e world, &amp; likewise the armour of the knight of the Sunne of no lesse strength then his, the sharp edges of their cutting Swords had not so much force as to enter, neither to vnbuckle their armour, although they did execute their mightie blowes with all the force and strength possi|ble, by which meanes they were both in great securitie not to bee wounded, notwithstanding for all that, the great and mightie fury wherewith they dyd strike one another, dyd make them many times to stagger and bee amazed, and al|most beside themselues and put them in great daunger, and when the Knight of the Sunne did feele the great courage and strength of the Prince <HI>Meridian,</HI> hee did coniecture with himselfe that the Gods were all on his side, so that it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ot possible to ouercome him.</P>
<P><PB REF="86">Likewise the Prince <HI>Meridian</HI> saide vnto himselfe, without all doubt this is the Gr&eacute;eke knight which the Southsayers and wise men of my father did prognosticate should b&eacute;e mar|ried vnto the Princesse <HI>Lindabrides</HI> my sister, and that h&eacute;e should descend from high estate, for it s&eacute;emed him that if all the force of these knights that euer he had battel with, were ioyned together, it was not so much as that which h&eacute;e onely in this one knight, and both in thought and fury of their bat|taile, they were equall. As this faire Princesse <HI>Lindabrides</HI> did b&eacute;ehould them, sh&eacute;e lost the pleasant and faire colour of hir face, &amp; was greatly troubled to s&eacute;e hir brother brought into such extremitie, for that sh&eacute;e thought there was not a|ny Knight in all the world that might compare with him. At this present the worthie Prince <HI>Meridian</HI> did strike the knight of the Sunne such a blow with both his hands vpon the helme, that h&eacute;e tooke away the sight of his eyes, and the raines of his bridle fell out of his hands, but straight way this <HI>gran Alphoebo</HI> gaue him his payment, and stroke him so terrible a blow vpon his hard and Diamond Healme, that it made no lesse noise then the Thunder doth in the re|gion of the aire, when it Thundereth downe the Thunder|bolt, and troubling his remembrance h&eacute;e fell forwards vppon his Saddle bow, without other moouing, and his Horse <HI>Cornerino</HI> carryed him round about the fielde with|out any remembraunce. This worthie Prince reuiued pre|sently, and s&eacute;eing himselfe so far from his enimie, he set spurs to his horse with great fury, and ran against him, and when h&eacute;e came nigh vnto him, he stroke him such a blow vpon the healme, that the Knight of the Sunne thought verely his eyes shold haue ben burned out of his head, with the great aboundaunce of sparkles of fire that flew from thence, but the Prince <HI>Meridian</HI> dyd not goe without his payment, for that the Knight of the Sunne retourned vpon him with great furie, so that the one laide vpon the other very strongly, and the battayle b&eacute;etwixt them dyd endure

more then two houres, in such sort that the Gyauntes and many other Knights which came thether at the noyse of the battaile, greatly meruayled, and dyd wonder with themselues, how they could in any wyse endure so much trauaile.</P>
<P>Lykewise the faire Princesse <HI>Lyndabrides,</HI> who with great admiration did b&eacute;ehold the battaile, was in a strange confusion in hir selfe, and could not imagine what that knight should b&eacute;e that was so strong, and with so great va|lour and prowesse dyd maintaine the battayle against hir Brother, and which was of so mightie personage, and of so good proportion. In this sort dyd these valyaunt and worthie warriours contended full two houres and a halfe, and there was no aduauntage knowen of eyther part, but in the ende the wrath of the Knight of the Sunne did so increase, that his blowes s&eacute;emed to b&eacute;e of more strength and fury then at the b&eacute;eginning, but the Prince <HI>Meridian</HI> did con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> alwayes in one estate, and his force was at all times equall, and s&eacute;eing his aduersary so strong b&eacute;efore him, with both his handes h&eacute;e stroke him such a blow vppon the shoulder that h&eacute;e made him stoupe with his body forwards vpon the saddle bow. The Knight of the Sunne with a trise did raise himselfe vp againe, and setting againe in his saddle, h&eacute;e tooke his sword in both his hands, and stroke so terrible a blow at the Prince vppon his hard Healme, and with so great strength, that if h&eacute;e had not embraced the Horse neck, h&eacute;e had fallen downe to the ground, and the blow was so heauie vnto him, that h&eacute;e had thought a whole Tower had fallen vpon him, and when he knew and felt the great force and strength of his enimie, h&eacute;e lift vp his eyes to Heauen and sayde.</P>
<P>Oh soueraigne Gods, saue and defend m&eacute;e from this knight, for that according to his great force and might, and the inuinsible power that h&eacute;e vseth against m&eacute;e, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">aue no securitie of my lyfe vnder this hard and strong <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">rmour.
<PB REF="87">
And in saying these words he raised himselfe vp in his sad|dle, and stretched himselfe vpon his stirops, and with both his hands he stroke the knight of the Sunne such a terrible blow vpon his magicall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> that hee made all the teeth in his head to chatter one against the other, and to decline his head downe to his breast, who considering himselfe againe gratified his salutation with another blow, so furious, that he brought him out of all remembraunce, and his horse carried him throughout all the field as though hee had beene dead. The Knight of the Sunne at that time did stand still and not mooue himselfe, but abode still till such time as h&eacute;e should recouer. The Prince as soone as he was come againe vnto himselfe, tooke his Swoord in both his handes, and with great fury made towards the knight of the Sunne, who seeing him comming towards him dyd the lyke, and in the middest of their course they met together, and raysing the~selues both together vpon their stirrops, they stroke two such terrible and mightie blowes vpon their healmes, that the Knight of the Sunne ouerthrew the Prince <HI>Meridian</HI> to the ground so bolde of f&eacute;eling that he moued neither hand nor foote, but lay as one that had beene dead. Likewise the blow which the Prince gaue vnto the knight of the Sunne, was with so great force and strength that h&eacute;e made him bow with all his body forwards downe to his horse necke, and also hee stroke his healme from his head. Wherewith he remained vnarmed, and shewed to al the people his fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e and seuere countenaunce full of royall maiestie. And by reason that hee was chafed in the battaile, his coulour was the more liuelie and amorous, and in such sort that there was no feminine heart of so great force, that could make any resistaunce against that terrible and sodaine blow of naturall beautie. So that when the Princesse <HI>Lyndabri|des</HI> dyd s&eacute;e him, neyther the maiestie of hir high estate, nor th valoure of his couragious heart was sufficient to resist, but that sh&eacute;e must n&eacute;edes bee taken prisoner with his beau|tie and loue, in such sort, that many dayes after passed b&eacute;e|fore they could finde remedie for to minister a salue to the

Likewise when he saw hir brother ly|ing a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ng vpon the ground as though he had ben dead. She ther lost hir fresh &amp; liuelie coulour, &amp; fell in a sound in the armes of hir Ladies &amp; gentlewomen, then the knight of the Sun alighted from his horse, &amp; went vnto the Prince &amp; pul|led his healme from his head, and saw that all his face was swollen, &amp; that he voided much blood at his mouth, for which he was very sorrowfull, for he thought he had ben dead, the which he would should not haue happened for all the goods in the world, for that his sister the Princesse <HI>Lindabrides</HI> should conceiue no displeasure against him. And againe, h&eacute;e had him in great estimation, for that he was a knight of such valour &amp; prowesse, but he was quickely cl&eacute;ered of that sor|row, for that after he had giuen him some aire, he straght way by little &amp; little came vnto himselfe. So when he was wholie in his perfect remembrance, &amp; saw himselfe vnarmed and in the armes of his aduersary, with a mightie courage he embraced patience, &amp; y&eacute;elded himselfe vnto that his pre|sent misfortune in b&eacute;eing so ouercome, &amp; with a ch&eacute;erefull and seuere countenance he spake vnto the knight of the <HI>Sun</HI> and said.</P>

<HEAD>How the Knight of the Sunne and the princesse Lindabrides trauailed towards Constantinople, &amp; sent messengers to the Emperour Trebatio, to giue him to vnderstand of their comming. Chap. 24.</HEAD>
<P>_WHen the next day was come, the knight of the Sun did arise from his bed, &amp; his Pages did help to arme himselfe with that gallant and strong armour of the prince <HI>Meridian,</HI> &amp; like|wise did gird about him his rich sword, and when he was armed, it was straunge to b&eacute;e s&eacute;ene how well it did become him. And when he vnderstoode that the Princesse <HI>Lindabrides</HI> was vp &amp; ready, and that she would come forth, he went towardes hir chamber doore, but when he should come before hir presence, his flesh trembled, as though a whole armie of knights would assalt him. And when he was entered into hir chamber, he found the faire Princesse accompanied with hir damsells &amp; ready to come forth, &amp; shewing vnto him great curtesie (whom the Prin|cesse was not a little ioyfull to see) she spake vnto him &amp; said. Sir Knight, how hath it ben with you all this night in your new lodging. Uery well faire Ladie, answered he, &amp; I could well haue slept in that rich &amp; soft bed which I had, if other oc|casions had not troubled my mind &amp; caused me to watch: the~ according vnto your saying sayd the princesse, you haue not slept well. No forsooth Lady, sayde the Knight, for that cares be enemies to rest &amp; sl&eacute;epe, &amp; doe bannish away all ease, &amp; es|pecially when they be new conceiued.</P>
<P><PB REF="91">The Princesse did very well vnderstand to what intent their words were spoken, and it did nothing grieue hir to heare them rehearsed, yet because she would not make any outward shew that she vnderstoode them, she saide. Unto all sorts of men it is naturall to be carefull, &amp; ther is none that can liue with so great felicitie in this life, but at one time or other he shall be troubled with carrs, therfore let vs goe vn|to our seates and commaund that the chariot may goe for|wards on our iourney, for that it is time.

And this faire Princesse did as greatlie reioyce to haue by hir him whom she loued with all hir heart, but hir great maiestie that she shewed in outward appearance was such, that the knight of the Sunne durst not be so bold as to make manifest vnto hir his loue, but rather had hir in estimation, as though there had ben present <HI>Iuno,</HI> his princi|pall Goddesse.

straight way b&eacute;efore hir foure of those Gyaunts which were on Horsebacke, who were Kings, and had crownes of siluer vpon their heads, and dyd informe them what they should say, and sent them vnto the Emperour <HI>Trebatio.</HI> So these foure kings went vnto <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and they ente|red into the great Court at such time as it was full of di|uerse armed knights, for to celebrate the Feastes and tri|umphes which were there ordained. And at such time as the Emperour <HI>Trebatio</HI> and the Empresse <HI>Briana</HI> were at the windowes of the pallace, beholding the great feasts and Iourneyes which were there made. And when these foure Gyants did enter into the great Court, all people dyd very well beehould them, and made them way that they might passe whether they would. So they demaunded for the Em|perour, who beeing certified what they were, they went vn|to the Pallace gate and did alight from their Horsses, and went vp whereas the Emperour was, and much people fol|lowed them to know wherefore their comming was, b&eacute;eing so sodaine. And when they came b&eacute;efore the Emperour, one of the Gyants saide these words following.</P>
<P><Q>Most high and mightie Emperour, you shall vnder|stand that in the Orientall regions of <HI>Scythia</HI> the diuine Gods dyd create a Damsell, who is endued with so great grace and beautie, that sh&eacute;e is had in no lesse estimation then a celestiall creature, who is daughter vnto the migh|tie Emperour of the <HI>Tartarians,</HI> King of kings, and Lord ouer all the Lords in the Orient.

And in the ende of many and diuerse iudgements of prognostications and
<PB REF="92" MS="y">
deuination, it was concluded that these two <HI>Princes</HI> should come into this thy Empire of <HI>Grecia,</HI> in such triumphaunt manner as you shall quickly s&eacute;e, in such sort, that if there be any knight, that in part and defence of the Princesse <HI>Lin|dabrides</HI> did enter into battaile with the Prince <HI>Meridian,</HI> and ouercome him, that the same knight should possesse the place of the Prince, and for the space of two months defend and maintaine the beautie of this Princesse in thy Court. And if it so fall out h&eacute;e b&eacute;e not ouercome by any nother knight, that the~ hee shall haue for spouse the faire Princesse <HI>Lyndabrides,</HI> and shall b&eacute;e successour with hir in the great Empire of <HI>Tartaria,</HI> and hee that shall ouercome the other, and make hir defence for the space of two months, shal haue the like. And to the contrary, if the Prince <HI>Meridian,</HI> after that h&eacute;e hath trauailed throughout all the kingdomes and prouinces of thy Empire, &amp; is not ouercome but doth main|taine still the victorie, that then h&eacute;e should b&eacute;e sworne for Prince and euerlasting successour of the whole Empire. So that in this sort and for this occasion they came vnto your Empire. And after that the Prince <HI>Meridian</HI> had trauayled through some kingdomes and ouercome many Princes and knighis, the diuine gods did permit them at length to meete with a knight of so much bountie and force, that entering into battaile with the Prince hee got the victorie, and dyd ouerthrow him from his horse to the ground with one blow with his sword that h&eacute;e gaue him: and that b&eacute;eing done, h&eacute;e entered into his place, and b&eacute;eing readie with the <HI>Prin|cesse</HI> to come hether to this thy court, they first determined to send vs hether vnto you, from them w&eacute;e should desire to kisse your Emperiall hands, and to request you that you would accept and receiue their comming in good part, for that their intension is for no other thing but to serue you.

The faire &amp; royall princesse <HI>Claridiana</HI> is very well welcome, for that many daies past you haue ben of me meruailouslie wished &amp; looked for. This worthie Princesse when she saw that sh&eacute;e was knowen by the old woman, being very much amazed, she said: Of a truth gentle madame, your words, &amp; that which hath happe|ned h&eacute;ere vnto me, doth put me in great admiration, &amp; I do not know what I should say vnto this which I haue s&eacute;ene.

in all the world, for so soone as shee was slaine they were brought hether by a wise man that did foresee &amp; know that it should be atchieued by a damosell, who in forre of armes, &amp; beautie, should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ar surmount that famous queene.

And for that I do perceiue you are desirous to know who I am, you shall vnderstand that I am called <HI>Oligas,</HI> of whom those great mountaines doth take their names, for that I haue many yeares past, had my habitation &amp; dwelling place here as you haue seene.

<P>When the old woman had vttered these words, the princes was much amazed to heare hir, &amp; no lesse ioyfull for the pre|cious armour which she had obtained.

And after she was armed, y^e wise <HI>Oligas</HI> did take hir by the hand &amp; said: come worthy princes &amp; go with me, &amp; I will shew you things that you will reioyce at. Then this Lady did cary hir out of one quadran into an other, till such time as they came into a faire &amp; great hall, wherevpon the wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s was painted all the fairest damosells that were in all the world? such as in times past had the fame to be faire &amp; beautifull. Amongst the which y^e princes did see hir owne face pictured, &amp; next vnto hir, she saw the Empresse <HI>Briana,</HI> and the
<PB REF="98">
faire and beautifull <HI>Oliuia,</HI> at whose great beautie they did much meruaile. And going forwards, they saw the faire &amp; ex|cellent Lady <HI>Lindabrides,</HI> sitting in hir triumphant Chariot, at whose great maiestie, and soueraigne beautie, this royall Princesse was very much amazed. And turning vnto the la|dy <HI>Oligas,</HI> she asked of hir who that gentle woman should be, and wherfore she did put hir selfe into that chariot. So after a while y^t they had well perused all y^t was ther to b&eacute;e s&eacute;ene, this Lady tooke the princesse by the hand &amp; lead hir out of that hall into another, wheras was pictured all the famous knights that hath ben &amp; wer at that present in all the world, &amp; all such as were dead &amp; past, were painted vpon another: amongst the which she saw pictured, that illustrious &amp; wor|thy Greeke, the knight of the <HI>Sun,</HI> who aboue all the rest did manifest himselfe, as did apere: &amp; had before him all y^e whole castell of <HI>Lindaraza,</HI> &amp; the great mightie &amp; wonderfull bat|tailes that he had with the knight of triumphant chariet, &amp; the faire <HI>Lindabrides</HI> therin, in the like manner as he was in <HI>Constantinople,</HI> defending hir great beautie. And as the roi|all princes did cast hir eies vpon him, &amp; did consider his migh|tie statnre &amp; gentle disposition, &amp; his seuere cou~tenance, who s&eacute;emed to bee more a celestiall creature then any humane knight. And ioyning therevnto his great &amp; mightie wonder|full d&eacute;edes &amp; prowesse, which was portraied ther before him. She straight way found hir selfe wounded with his loue, in whose heroicall &amp; liberall hart, did neuer enter any humane thought before: was now all onely with that sight, taken prisoner in such sort, that life should first want, before that she should be released and at libertie. And because she would dissemble that new &amp; amorous passion, she asked of the old Lady, who that knight should be, then the Lady, who did wel vnderstand hir thought, said: you shall vnderstand faire prin|cesse, that this knight is called the knight of the Sun, &amp; now by another name is called the knight of the Chariot: this is be that doth defend in <HI>Constantinople,</HI> the beautie of that

Lady <HI>Lindabrides,</HI> according as I haue tolde you, when you did behold the infant. And as yet it is not knowen whose son he is, nor he doth not know his father nor his mother, but the time will come &amp; that shortly, that they shalbe knowen, greatly vnto their honour and praise. And thus much I can certifie you, thnt neuer amongst knights past of old antiqui|tie, neither at this present hath ben, nor is, that is equall vn|to this valiant &amp; worthie knight, &amp; his worthie &amp; heroycall d&eacute;edes will extinguish &amp; blot out all other before his time, and all others that shall come after htm.</P>
<P>These were wordes that caused the wounded hart of the Princes to be the more tormented, for considering the great worthinesse of his person, and the ielosie that she felt in hir mind, &amp; had of that Princesse <HI>Lindabrides</HI> caused hir loue to be the more greater. And from that present she had great desire to passe into <HI>Grecia,</HI> &amp; to s&eacute;e with hir eies, that knight whose picture had robbed hir of hir libertie. And shee was fullie certified within hir selfe, that if the knight of the cha|riot did once beholde hir beautie &amp; fairenesse, that he would quickly forget that princesse, whose beautie he doth now de|fend, although she should appeare to be more fairer. And ha|uing these thoughts within hir, she was a good while &amp; could not take away hir eies, in beholding y^e picture of the knight of the Sun, till such time as hauing shame of that old lady, she put hir eies apart, &amp; did behold the mighty <HI>Trebatio,</HI> &amp; his sonne <HI>Rosicleer,</HI> who in his stature &amp; countenance, did very much resemble the knight of the Sun. And for to know who they were, she did aske of the old Lady, and she did tell hir that next vnto the knight of the Sun, that they two were the best &amp; strongest knights in all the world. And how that, that mightie Emperour, was h&eacute;e whom the knight of the Sunne had taken and deliuered out of the inchantment of <HI>Lindaraza,</HI> as sh&eacute;e had seene in the painting of the knight of the Sunne. So b&eacute;eing much amazed at that sh&eacute;e had s&eacute;ene, sh&eacute;e remained there till she thought it requi|sit to returne vnto hir companye, for that they should not
<PB REF="99">
trouble themselues in s&eacute;eking hir. And ther with he said vnto the old Lady, that she would depart if it were hir pleasure, &amp; that she had no other thing to commaund hir. Unto whom she answered, saying, that the might vse hir discreation, al|though she had many other thinges to shew hir, which sh&eacute;e should keepe close vntill such time as occasion serued to come that way againe, at whose sight she should take great plea|snre. And therewith she tooke hir by the hand and carried hir forth the same way she entred, till such time as they were out of the caue, wheras the old Lady committed hir to God, and taking hir leaue of the princesse she returned into hir caue, &amp; straight way vpon a sodaine the caue was vanished a|way, in such sort, that the princesse could see it no more, &amp; re|mained a while amazed at that which had happened she toke hir horse wheras she had left him tied to a tr&eacute;e, &amp; sought out hir company, very glad &amp; ioyfull for that precious armour which she had won, although otherwise she were so farre in loue with the knight of the Chariot, that she thought long to returne vnto <HI>Trabisond,</HI> &amp; depart from thence &amp; passe in|to <HI>Grecia,</HI> for to s&eacute;e that knight, for she thought with hir self, that h&eacute;e alone was aboue all the rest of the world, that did deserue to inioy hir person &amp; beautie. And with this great desire she trauailed, till such time as by the sound of hir horne hir knights came vnto hir, who meruailed to s&eacute;e hir armed with that precious and rich armour, &amp; did receiue hir with great ioy &amp; pleasure for that they had gone about seeking for hir a good while, complayning very much for hir absence, for that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">nspected some mishap had chaunced vnto hir.

<HEAD>Of that which happened vnto the sorrowfull knight of Cupid, after that hee was carried into the Fountaine of the sauage people. Chapter 27.</HEAD>
<P>_YOu doe well remember of the straunge and sodaine losse of that amorous and stronge knight <HI>Rosicleer,</HI> how after h&eacute;e had drunke of the water of the Fountaine of the Sauage people, hee fell downe on the ground, and how that there came foorth of that Fountayne a monster of the Sea, and tooke him in hir armes, and carri|ed him vnto the deapth and bottome of the water. And how that his great and faithfull friend the King <HI>Sacridoro</HI> not hauing so much patience as to suffer so great losse, did throw himselfe after him into the fountaine, with great good will to receiue the death with him. Now the Historie saith that the meruayles of this fountayne were very many and strange, for that so soone as this amorous knight was in the depth of that water, h&eacute;e found himselfe in a very fayre and and gr&eacute;ene field ful of flowres, wheras the calmenesse of the aire, and the cleerenes of the <HI>Sun</HI> seemed vnto him to b&eacute;e the same as it was b&eacute;efore, although co~sidering what he had be|fore suffered, h&eacute;e s&eacute;emed to bee in another world, &amp; looking a|bout for the monster that had brought him thether, hee saw that sh&eacute;e was a faire damsell &amp; well proportioned, who with a merry cou~tenance came vnto him &amp; said: Ualiant &amp; hardy knight, by your great bounty &amp; strength, you haue obtained to come &amp; drink of y^e water of this fountaine, &amp; by drinking therof you are come hether, therfore I will giue you to vn|derstand of this aduenture, &amp; of the merueilous things that you shall h&eacute;ere see.

When the fayre Damsell had spoke these words the knight of <HI>Cupide</HI> did salute hir very curteously, and therwith sh&eacute;e b&eacute;egan to declare hir ad|uentnre, saying.</P>
<P><Q>You shall vnderstand (gentle knight) that the king <HI>Po|lidarco,</HI> who is now king ouer this Countrie, had a son cal|led <HI>Don Lusindo,</HI> who b&eacute;eing dubbed knight, was one of the strongest and well proportionedst knight y^t could b&eacute;e found in all these parts. Likewise y^e king <HI>Polidarco</HI> had a brother, a very wise man in the art Magicke, who dwelled in these mountaines, and in this valley, which s&eacute;emeth vnto you to be a new world, and this wise man was my father, who for my better sauegard and honour, did carry me vnto the courtof the king <HI>Polidarco,</HI> wheras I continued certaine y&eacute;eres in the company of the qu&eacute;ene &amp; hir daughter <HI>Oriselua.</HI> And b&eacute;e|ing there, the prince <HI>Don Lusindo</HI> fell in loue with m&eacute;e, inso|much that in the end of many daies he did so importune me, that h&eacute;e plighted m&eacute;e his faith and troth to take m&eacute;e for his wife, and I hauing my confidence therein, h&eacute;e did obtaine of m&eacute;e all that his pleasure was, and although this was kept secret many daies, yet in the ende it came to b&eacute;e discouered, for that my father was very old, and knowing that his time was come that h&eacute;e should die, h&eacute;e did procure to marry m&eacute;e and giue mee vnto a husband, according vnto my estate and honour. And b&eacute;eing very importunate with m&eacute;e therein, I was constrained of necessitie to declare vnto him y^t I was made sure vnto the Prince <HI>Lusindo,</HI> and how that h&eacute;e was my spouse and husband. And at such time as the king my fa|ther went vnto the prince, for to know of him the truth, he denyed it and sayd&punc; that there neuer passed beetwixt vs any such promise. And all that euer my Father could, was not sufficient to make him confesse the truth. And h&eacute;e s&eacute;eing the
<PB N="94" REF="100">
great disloyalty of him, determined before h&eacute;e did die to b&eacute;e reuenged of that iniury, and likewise of me, in such sort, that in time ther might be some remedy, &amp; so by his great know|ledge he brought the prince hether vnto his habitation, and put him into a quadran full of fire, wheras he is continual|ly burning, and without ceasing he crieth out &amp; giueth terri|ble shrikes, &amp; cannot come foorth of that quadran. And when he was put therin, he said, that by no ma~ner of wise he could be cleere of that great torment and peine, till such time as a knight, who by his bounty &amp; prowesse, should come vnto the fountaine of the sauage people and drinck of the water, and drinking therof, he shuld discouer the entry into this habita|tio~, as you haue discouered the same. And how y^t this knight by the great loialty of his loue should supply the great dis|loialty of the prince, &amp; how h&eacute;e should take him forth of that quadran wheras he is, by y^e force and strength of his armes, first getting the victorie by battaile, and how that after h&eacute;e is deliuered from that place, he should receiue a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">d take me to bee his spouse, &amp; tell the truth of all that had passed. This b&eacute;eing ordained and done, my father died, and h&eacute;ere I doo re|maine all alone very sad and sorrowfull for his death, and with great griefe and compassion of the prince, for that ther cannot be a more grieuous thing in the world the~ to heare him shrike and lament. And although the king his Father did know of a certaintie that the wise man his brother did bring him hether vnto this habitation, to b&eacute;e reuenged on him, yet for all that, h&eacute;e could neuer finde the entrie into it, although h&eacute;e hath procured by all meanes y^t euer was possi|ble. So that the king and the qu&eacute;ene his mother, and all the rest of the kingdome doo liue in great sorrow and heauinesse for the losse of the prince: for this habitation hath an other entry by a Caue, which in all the world doth beare y^e fame, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ut the entrie thereof is so perilous and dark, that there is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">o humane knight dare enter it, and there is none but I a|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">one that doth know of this entry into the valley. And s&eacute;eing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">hat you, most ventrous knight, is h&eacute;e, by whom my Father

<P>Therefore I pray and desire you, to take compassion of this Prince, and of mee, who doo likewise in my hart f&eacute;ele euery way his paine and griefe: and goe set him at libertie, that possessing the same, h&eacute;e may goe and comfort his Parents, giuing them the ioy and pleasure, that in his recouering a|gaine they might receiue. And heere with the Gentlewoman made an ende of hir tale. And the knight of <HI>Cupide</HI> remai|ned, and maruailed at that which he had heard. And hauing a great desire to set at libertie the Prince <HI>Lusindo,</HI> h&eacute;e re|quested the damsell to shew him wher h&eacute;e was, &amp; h&eacute;e would doo all that in him did lye for to set him at libertie.</P>
<P>And when hee had sayd these words, the damsell did take him by the hand, &amp; lead him through that floorishing gr&eacute;ene Ualley, till they came vnto certaine high &amp; mighty Rocks, wherewith all that valley was compassed about. And there was cut out of one rock a paire of staires, wher at this da|mosell and the knight of <HI>Cupide</HI> went vp, till such time as they came vnto a dore, where into they entred, and came into very many great and faire roomes, at the beauty wher|of the knight of <HI>Cupid</HI> greatly maruailed, for that b&eacute;esides they were all cut out of the hard stone, they s&eacute;emed to b&eacute;e the straungest kinde of work that euer hee saw in his lyfe. And straight way when h&eacute;e b&eacute;eganne to enter in thereat, they might h&eacute;ere the Prince <HI>Don Lusindo</HI> complaine with great and terrible shricke.</P>
<P>So they went forwards till they came vnto the Quadran of Fyer, the doore whereof was open, where|at h&eacute;e saw the bright flames of Fyer, of which the whole quadran was full, which was a thing of great wonder. And h&eacute;e saw in the midst of the Quadran, the prince all armed, with his Sword in his hand, sitting in a Chayre, and could not mooue, neither to the one part nor to the other, and it was very pittifull to s&eacute;e his demeanor. And when they came thether, the damosell sayd vnto the knight of <HI>Cupide:</HI> wor|thy knight, if you be amorous, and haue not committed an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> disloyaltie against your friend, you may without all le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">

<P>So when they were come vnto <HI>Constantinople,</HI> they did one day enter into the great place, at such time as it was full of knights, as well straungers as of their owne country.

Which <HI>knights</HI> not hauing any thing to doe, some departed into their owne countries, &amp; other some went out of the court to s&eacute;eke their aduentures in the Empire, till such time as the month was passed. In the end of which, the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Chariot</HI> should returne to defend the beautie of the faire princesse <HI>Linda|brides&punc;</HI> so that at that time the citie of <HI>Constantinople</HI> was left voide, and all the land of the Empire full of <HI>Knights,</HI> as well strangers as naturalls amongst whom there did not lacke to bee euerie day great contentions.

that as h&eacute;e and y^e king <HI>Sacridoro</HI> did passe through a mighty and great vsed way, they saw the giant comming the same way, with more then thirty of his owne <HI>knights,</HI> which bare him company, and he was of so high and big stature, that he did appeare aboue all the rest from the brest vpwards, and when these two <HI>Knights</HI> came nigh vnto them, the Gyaunt dyd b&eacute;ehould them, and liking well both of the <HI>Knights</HI> and theyr Horsses, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> straight waies sayd that they should pre|pare themselues vnto the iust with him, one to one, or both together, which their pleasure was, and best liked them.</P>
<P>Then the <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Cupid,</HI> who had a great desire to proue himself with the giant, requested the King <HI>Sacridoro,</HI> that he would let him haue the first battell.

And when the Gy|aunt saw him so big and well made, it liked him well, and laughed vnto himselfe, b&eacute;ecause h&eacute;e would iust alone with him, and might profit himselfe with his companion. The gy|aunt had vnder him a very fayre and mighty Horse called <HI>Rondarte,</HI> that next vnto the Horse <HI>Cornerino</HI> was the best in all the world, and for that hee was so mighty and strong, h&eacute;e trauailed on him, for if h&eacute;e had not beene such a one, ther were no horse that were able to sustaine and suffer him, for that hee was so big, and againe the great waight of his ar|mour which was more, and b&eacute;eing on Horseback h&eacute;e had a mightie great &amp; big speare in his hand of so great waight, that a <HI>Knight</HI> had inough to doo to lift it fro~ the ground, &amp; therwith he put himselfe right against the <HI>knight</HI> of <HI>Cupid,</HI> in the presence of many <HI>Knights</HI> y^t were gathered together to s&eacute;e what should passe b&eacute;etwixt them. So both of tham did broch theyr horses with their spurs, with so great fury, that it s&eacute;emed the ground wold sincke wheras theyr horsses ran.

And that you haue great reson to detend the same.

But when the royal princes did s&eacute;e that pleasant coun|tenaunce, whose all onely picture did wound hir vnto y^e hart, &amp; made hir to come into those parts, the ioy &amp; pleasure which she receiued, I am not able to expresse: and hir loue did the more increase, for y^t it seemed vnto hir, that by a great deale, that royall presence that she had before hir, might be com|pared vnto the figure which she saw in y^e mountaines of <HI>Oli|gas.</HI> Then the knight of the <HI>Sun</HI> went vnto hir &amp; said, wor|thy gentlewoman, shew vs I pray you so much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">, as to tell vnto vs, who you are: for that according vnto the strange things which we do s&eacute;e in you, we cannot bel&eacute;eue to the contrary, but that you do desend from the heauens, and that you are y^e diuine goddesse <HI>Palas,</HI> of whose sight, I should thinke my selfe happie, if feare did not put me in doubt to obtaine so great glory.

of his f&eacute;eling, &amp; made him to loose his stirrops, and the bridle of his horse.

<HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> my brother. And in saying these words, the valiant knight of <HI>Cupid,</HI> stroke his furious horse with the spurs, &amp; returned vpon the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> &amp; with so cou|ragious force, hee stroke so terrible a blow, with his hands, vpon his rich &amp; precious helme, that the sound thereof was heard through all the Citie of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> &amp; was char|ged so much therwith, that he thought verely that his eyes and all the t&eacute;eth in his head were broken, by the great abun|dance of bloud that issued out from the lasing of his helme. And his horse <HI>Cornerino,</HI> did founder vnder him, with the great force and wayght of the same blow, &amp; so remayned a good while, &amp; could not arise, till such time as the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> with great fury did quicken him with his spurs: &amp; said within himselfe, that with great reason the <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Cupid</HI> was so praysed in the court, for that ther was neuer <HI>Knight</HI> or <HI>Gyant,</HI> that euer did bring him into that extremi|tie. So ther againe these valiant warriors did returne vn|to their battaile, with so furious brauenesse, that all those which did behold them, were greatly amazed, musing how that two humane bodyes could endure so long, and suffer so great torment. And with great reason they saide, that those two <HI>knights</HI> was the flower of all the <HI>knights</HI> in the world.</P>
<P>The Emperour <HI>Trebatio</HI> being very much amazed to s&eacute;e the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> in that extremity, h&eacute;e said vnto the prin|ces <HI>Claridiana.</HI> Oh who had s&eacute;ene the high &amp; mighty <HI>knight|hood</HI> that was done by the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> in the Iland of <HI>Lindaraza,</HI> vpon the monstrous giants &amp; wild beasts, &amp; the great prowes done against so many worthie <HI>knights,</HI> as well in this court, as in other places, that s&eacute;emed to be done by some diuine prouidence, rather then by any humane knight. And now to s&eacute;e him in so great danger to be ouercome by one alone <HI>Knight,</HI> surely it is a strange thing, &amp; to be won|dred at. Of a truth, said the faire princes, they which haue not s&eacute;ene, cannot well bel&eacute;eue it, but yet it s&eacute;emeth vnto me that the <HI>knight</HI> of <HI>Cupid</HI> should be such a <HI>Knight,</HI> that wher<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">
<PB N="114" REF="120">
h&eacute;e is knowen he is had in the like reputacion, as the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> is with you.</P>
<P>In this time the valiant <HI>knights</HI> neuer seased, neither were they weary, although more then two houres they combatted together, but s&eacute;emed rather with more force &amp; fury, then at the beginning, they did perseuer in the strong battaile, stri|king the one the other with so great fury, that many times their heauy blowes did astony them, as well the one as the other, &amp; brought them both vnto the point to be ouercome.</P>
<P>Which was the occasion that their stout couragis did ga|ther more strength, &amp; their strong armes the more force: &amp; made either of them to think, that it were better to be slaine then to be ouercome, before them, whom they did combatte, which was the occasion, that their battaile was of a great deale more force then at the beginning. And againe, if their horses had not ben the best in all the world, they could not haue caried them, neither haue suffered the great trauaile, which their maisters put them vnto, with entring in, &amp; rety|ring backe, with the Arong &amp; heauy blowes which they re|ceiued, &amp; the light leapes &amp; springes which they gaue, forced by their sharpe spurs was sufficient to haue weried them: but by reason that their horses were so good, &amp; their armour so suer, all the state of the battaile remained in the force &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">he strength of the <HI>knights.</HI> And by reason, that either of the~ was suffiently furnished therewith, was the occasion that the battaile went in such sort, that betwixt them ther was not knowen any vauntage.</P>
<P>And as the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> at that tyme did behold the faire Princesse <HI>Lindabrides,</HI> and saw hir to b&eacute;e so sadde and lost all hir coulour, he suspected the occasion to be in the perill of the battayle. With a new fury, and double force, hee stroke so mightie a blow at the <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Cupid,</HI> that he thought ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ily with that alone blow, to haue finished the battaile, for that his armes did hang lash downe, &amp; his head vpon his horse neck, &amp; he without remembrance, in such sort
<PB REF="121">
that his Horse caried him about that great place, and all men did loke when he would haue fallen from his Horse to the ground.</P>
<P>And for that the <HI>Knight</HI> of the sun did think that he had ben dead, he did leaue to follow him. But yet h&eacute;e had not conclu|ded to giue a compasse round about with his Horse, in signe of victory, when the good <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Cupid</HI> was wholy come a|gaine to himselfe, &amp; was setled in his saddle, and recouering his sword which he had lost by the strength of that blow w^t great fury he spurred his great and furious Horse, &amp; went towards the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> and setling himselfe vpon his stirrops, he stroke him such a blow vpon the shoulder, that if his inchanted armour had not ben such, without all doubt, he had clouen him vnto the Horse saddle. But by reason that they were so strong, his sword made no more signe on him, then if he hadde stroke vpon an anfield of st&eacute;ele. Yet for all that the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> was so charged with that blow, that if h&eacute;e had not imbraced himselfe about his horse neck, h&eacute;e had fallen downe vnto the ground.</P>
<P>Oh how great was the wrath which the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> receiued, in s&eacute;eing himselfe brought into so great extremity, before the royall and beautifull Princes <HI>Claridiana,</HI> and the faire princesse <HI>Lindabrides.</HI> It caused the fury of his mortall blowes to double, and to be angry with himselfe, for that one alone <HI>Knight</HI> should so long endure against him.</P>
<P>But what did all his wrath and fury profit him, for that h&eacute;e hadde to doe with that strong and worthy <HI>Ro|sicleer,</HI> the verye same who next vnto him, was the best <HI>Knight</HI> in all the world. And the same, that if all the <HI>Knights</HI> in that place should moue attempt agaynst him, his valiaunt and couragious heart should not faile him one iotte. And s&eacute;eing him selfe beefore the Emperour his Father, and the Empresse his Mother, if h&eacute;e got no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> the victory of the battaile, it would vtterly discourag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> him to come any more into their Court and presence
<PB N="115" REF="121">
which caused him to execute these rigorous blowes, with so great force, that it made the knight of the <HI>Sun,</HI> to wonder at his great strength. At this time the one was knowen so well to the other, that the end of the battell was very doubtfull, for that the greatest part of the day was past, wherein the valiant &amp; worthy <HI>knights</HI> had combatted, &amp; no lesse vantage to be iudged betwixt them then at the beginning. At which the Emperour &amp; the princesse &amp; all the rest of the <HI>knights</HI> &amp; Ladies that were in the pallace, very much meruailed, and said that the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> had met with his match. Like|wise the valiant king <HI>Sacridoro,</HI> for that he knew the great force &amp; strength of the <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Cupid,</HI> was greatly ama|zed that the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> should so long endure with him, &amp; said vnto himselfe: Surely not without great reason the high bounty of the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Chariot</HI> is extolled, that he alone doth maintaine himselfe against him, that the sa|uage people of the inchanted fountaine could not endure one halfe houre, and against him that the fierce Tiger and mon|strous Gyant, which were k&eacute;epers of the Prince <HI>Lusindo,</HI> could not make any resistance. And in saying these words h&eacute;e desired God of his goodnesse to graunt the victory vnto his perfect friend, for that beefore the Emperour <HI>Terbatio</HI> &amp; Empresse <HI>Briana,</HI> his father and mother, h&eacute;e might not b&eacute;e disgraced, which would b&eacute;e the occasion that h&eacute;e should neuer come more beefore them. In this time the blowes of these two valiant <HI>Knightes</HI> were so rigorous, that all those which did beholde them were greatly amazed, and two miles about that place was the noise of their blowes heard as though it had ben thunder, putting the hearers in great feare, and the lookers one waxed wery, but they s&eacute;emed with new force to begin the battell againe. So in this sort these valiaunt <HI>Knightes</HI> did perseuer in their rigorous battayle, without any ceasing, but still executing their terrible blows the one vpon the other, till more then sixe houres were past since the beginning of their combat, and it s&eacute;emed that the Sunne would seperate the battaile, for that she
<PB REF="122">

<P><Q>Oh lasie &amp; cowardly <HI>knight</HI> of <HI>Cupid,</HI> with what face canst thou come into the presence of the emperour <HI>Trebatio,</HI> &amp; ac|knowledge him to be thy father, s&eacute;eing that in his presence one <HI>Knight</HI> hath brought th&eacute;e into this extremity. Is it pos|sible that I am that same <HI>Rosicleer,</HI> who in the court of the king <HI>Oliuerio</HI> pushed out of their saddles so many <HI>knights</HI> &amp; gyants, &amp; he who alwaies thought that ther was none but he that was worthy to put his thought &amp; care vpon the prin|cesse <HI>Oliuia.</HI> Now doe I s&eacute;e that I haue no reason to blame that princesse for intreating me so euill, for that with one a|lone <HI>knight</HI> I cannot defend the iustice of hir great beautie. What is become of that great hardines wherwith I attem|ted the inchanted caue of <HI>Aridon,</HI> &amp; the mighty force wher|with I did ouercome those two furious beasts? Certainly I doe bel&eacute;eue that all is lost and gone, for that I cannot now make resistance against one <HI>knight:</HI> It is possible that I am that <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Cupid,</HI> that in all the battailes that he hath attempted in his life time got the victory? No surely, for that by one alone <HI>Knight</HI> I am at the point to be ouercome. Now I doe s&eacute;e that from this day forwards I must dye without all hope of any remedy for my sorrow and griefe, for that I am impotent, &amp; doe lack my force &amp; strength for to reuenge me of the prince <HI>Don Siluerio,</HI> &amp; the occasion I hoped to haue giuen, that the princesse <HI>Oliuia</HI> should haue vnderstood of hir errour: Oh my loyall, true, &amp; perfect friend king <HI>Sacridoro,</HI> what reason was it that did moue th&eacute;e for to throw thy self into that profound &amp; d&eacute;epe fountaine of the Sauages, and a|gaine, for to leaue thy louing wife &amp; naturall kingdome, for to beare &amp; k&eacute;epe company with a <HI>Knight,</HI> who before thy presence is at the point by one alone <HI>knight</HI> to be ouercome.

<P>At the same time the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> with no lesse sor|row &amp; griefe, said vnto himselfe.</P>
<P><Q>Oh weake &amp; cowardly <HI>knight,</HI> how much doth it stand th&eacute;e in hand from this day forwardes to loose the name of the <HI>Snn,</HI> for that all those which hath ben by th&eacute;e ouercome vn|der that name, doe account th&eacute;e for a coward &amp; of litle force, s&eacute;eing th&eacute;e by one alone <HI>knight</HI> to be brought vnto this per|plexitie. Is it possible that I am h&eacute;e that had so much cou|rage, &amp; was so hardy as to set my mind on two of the most highest damsells in all the world: Of a truth if I be the same with great reason I ought to receiue of them my payment for this my great folly, in considering what they are, &amp; I at the point to be ouercome in their presence. Oh royall prin|cesse <HI>Claridiana,</HI> how may you thinke your selfe mocked, that comming from so far countries onely for to s&eacute;e the wonder|full d&eacute;eds of the knight of the <HI>Sun,</HI> whose fame was so spred throughout all the world. And in the first battaile which you haue s&eacute;ene him to make, you doe see with the blowes of one alone <HI>knight</HI> brought out of his remembrance many times, &amp; his horse to cary him as a thing dead throughout the field. How can I from this day forwards without great shame come before you, hauing receiued me for your <HI>knight,</HI> and cannot in your presence defend your rare and singular beauty.</Q></P>

<P>So these valiant <HI>Knights</HI> saying these &amp; other words vnto themselues, did so much animate their couragious stomacks, that eight houres&punc; were past since the beginning of their ri|gorous battaile, &amp; at that time their wonderfull blowes s&eacute;e|med to be with more force &amp; strength, and their horses with their great &amp; continuall labour waxed weary, but these two valiant <HI>knights</HI> at that time s&eacute;emed to fight with new force &amp; strength, &amp; neuer ceased striking one another such terrible blowes, that the standers by had their eares filled with the sound of their fine tempered armour, and were so greatly a|mazed to s&eacute;e the great trauaile that they suffered in that bartaile, &amp; likewise to s&eacute;e with what great force &amp; strength they did execute the same, in the end of long time that they had indured, &amp; s&eacute;emed that ther was neuer done by them the like prowesse nor actiuitie, as was done at that prelent, as truth was, for that neither of them in all their liues was e|uer brought into the like extremity or perill, as they wer in this battaile, nor neuer had the like feare to be ouercome. But the great shame &amp; reproch, with the iealousie of their honor, did so much touch either of them, that it made them without feeling any trauaile to procure all that in them lay for to get the victory, or ele to die in the demaund. So at this time the golden <HI>Diana</HI> began to shew hir light in the ori|entall Regions, and the worthy <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Cudid</HI> not estee|ming his owne life, if h&eacute;e should not get the victory of the Knight of the Sunne, with both his hands, raising himselfe in his stirops, h&eacute;e stroke him so terrible a blow, that it did depriue him of his vnderstanding, &amp; made him to fall back|wards vpon the backe of the saddle, that his head touched the horse crouper, and his weary Horse carried him about that great place, in such sort, that all those which saw him,
<PB N="117" REF="123">
thought that h&eacute;e had b&eacute;ene dead. But when the Princesse <HI>Claridiana</HI> did s&eacute;e him in that plight, hir blood waxed could within hir body, and b&eacute;eing sore troubled, sh&eacute;e asked the Emperour if h&eacute;e were dead or no, but h&eacute;e was at that won|derfull blow so troubled, that h&eacute;e had no power at all for to answere hir, but whosoeuer at this time had s&eacute;ene the face of the faire Princesse <HI>Lindabrides,</HI> would haue knowen by hir coulour the great loue that sh&eacute;e did beare vnto him, but at such time as the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> did come agayne vnto himselfe, there was neuer <HI>Lion</HI> nor furious beast more outragious then h&eacute;e was, and considering the great danger and perill that hee was in, his out ragious heart was so full of mortall anguish, with vnmeasurable wrath, y^t h&eacute;e stroke his light horse with the Spurs, and crushed his t&eacute;eth toge|ther, that it s&eacute;emed sparkes of fire proc&eacute;eded from his eyes, and like vnto a whirle winde h&eacute;e ran towards the <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Cupid,</HI> who seeing him recouered againe, made likewise against him with so great fury, that the ground where his Horse dyd runne s&eacute;emed to tremble: Oh how great was the feare which the fury of these valyaunt <HI>knights</HI> caused in them that did b&eacute;ehold their mortall wrath, comming the one against the other, terrifying their vnderstanding to a|bide the end of their mortall blowes. I doo beleeue certainly that ther was not one <HI>knight</HI> in all that place, of what force and strength so euer h&eacute;e was, that s&eacute;eing the fury of those valiant <HI>knights,</HI> but h&eacute;e would haue b&eacute;ene terrified, neither was there any friend, although h&eacute;e had b&eacute;ene fully satisfied of the bountie of any of them, but would haue prayed vnto God for them, s&eacute;eing them in that great perill. The Em|perour <HI>Trebatio,</HI> with the great loue that h&eacute;e bare vnto the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> and the desire that h&eacute;e had to know the <HI>knight</HI> of <HI>Cupid,</HI> receiued no lesse feare then all the rest, and sayd.</P>
<P>Oh mightie God, thou who madest these <HI>Knights</HI> of no|thing, I praie and desire thee to aide and succour them, and let them not execute theyr great wrath the one vppon the other, neyther doe not permit that the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI>

b&eacute;e slaine b&eacute;efore h&eacute;e doo acknowledge thy great power, and turne vnto thy lawes, that his soule bee not condempned to immortall paine. So the swift course of theyr furious Hor|ses ioyned theyr encounters, and the two wrathfull <HI>Knights</HI> raysing themselues in theyr stirrops, pretending to make an end of theyr long and doubtfull battell, with the extremitie of all theyr force and strength, they stroke one another with so great wrath vpon theyr fine Helmes, that although the fine edges of theyr mightie cutting swoords could not enter nor cut theyr inchanted armour, yet these valiaunt <HI>Knights</HI> were so ouerlayd with the great might and power of theyr blows, that the <HI>knight</HI> of <HI>Cupid</HI> was constrained to decline himselfe on the one side, and therwith hee fell downe to the ground, wheras he lay, and mooued neither hand nor foot, but was as one that were dead, and the inuinsible <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> by the force of the blow was cleane voide of any vnder|standing, and had likewise fallen to the ground if Fortune had not fauoured him, that he fell forwards vpon the saddle bow, that his head touched the Horse necke, and his armes hung downe on both sides, and voyded great abundance of blood out of his mouth &amp; eyes, in&punc; such sort, that they thought him likewise to b&eacute;e as dead as the <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Cupid,</HI> and his horse beeing tormented with that terrible blow did founder vnder him, and remained without any moouing, as though the bones of his legges had b&eacute;ene broken. At which sight all those that were in that great place, receiued so great sorrow and griefe at the extremitie of these two valiant <HI>Knights,</HI> that thinking they had b&eacute;ene dead, they lamented as though they had b&eacute;ene theyr naturall bretheren. But the Princesse <HI>Lindabrides</HI> when sh&eacute;e saw hir <HI>Knight</HI> in that estate, not ha|uing any power to resist so mortall a griefe, had not the power to gouerne hir selfe, but fell in a sound, &amp; had fallen out of hir Chaire wheras sh&eacute;e sat, if hir Gentlewomen had not ben, who s&eacute;eing hir in that case, tooke hir in their armes, and carryed hir into hir closet, and laide hir vppon hir bed,
<PB N="118" REF="124">
whereas sh&eacute;e had more semblaunce to b&eacute;e dead, then as one hauing any lyfe.</P>
<P>Likewise the Princesse <HI>Claridiana,</HI> with no lesse paine and griefe did b&eacute;eholde hir <HI>knight,</HI> who with the mightinesse of hir couragious heart did make resistance against that amo|rous thought which loue caused within hir. Who with no lesse sorrow and griefe when h&eacute;e saw the <HI>Knights</HI> in this ex|tremitie, and as though h&eacute;e had knowen the~ to bee his sons, h&eacute;e withdrew himselfe from the window, &amp; descended downe into the great place, accompanied with many <HI>Knights,</HI> h&eacute;e went whereas these <HI>knights</HI> were, and found that they were compassed about with their perfect friends, the two Princes and the king <HI>Sacridoro,</HI> who lamented with great abundance of teares, and caused theyr Helmes to bee pulled of, and to throw water in theyr faces, thinking therewith and with the aire&punc; they would come againe to themselues, but all was in vaine that they did, for that there was in them no o|ther signe, but as though they had b&eacute;ene starke dead. For which occasion &amp; with dolorous griefe the Emperour com|maunded them to b&eacute;e carried vnto his Royall Pallace, and caused their armour to b&eacute;e taken off, and to b&eacute;e laide in se|uerall beds, which was in two quadrans, very richly hang|ed, ioyning the one vnto the other.</P>
<P>Then were called together the best Hhisitions and Sur|gions that were in all the whole citie of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> who did b&eacute;ehold and peruse them very well, &amp; tolde vnto the <HI>Em|perour</HI> that they were not dead, although they were in great peril of their liues.

<PB REF="125">
and h&eacute;e had so great loue vnto both those <HI>Knights,</HI> that h&eacute;e would haue giuen halfe his estate to haue seene them out of that great perill. So after the Phisicions and Surgions had well perused them, they found that the greatest euill which they had, was wearinesse of theyr bodies, and all their bones and flesh brused, by the mightie force of theyr terri|ble blowes. So they ministered vnto them very sw&eacute;et and comfortable ointments, and all that was necessay for them and most conuenient, and commaunded that euerie man should depart from thence and lette them alone, that they might sl&eacute;epe and take theyr rest, with onely two Pages, which were in another chamber ther by with great silence, that whensoeuer these <HI>knights</HI> should come vnto themselues they should call the Phisitions and Surgions. In this time there was not a <HI>knight</HI> in y^e citie of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> neither in that great place, nor in their Tents in the field, as well straungers and Countrie men, that did occupie themselues in any other communication, but in the wonderfull and ti|merous battaile of these two <HI>Knights,</HI> and of their mightie blowes, perticularly euery thing as it was, and sayde, that there was neuer seene in all the world such lyke contenti|on b&eacute;etwixt two <HI>knights,</HI> with so great strength, force, and perill, neyther was any Damsell or Gentlewoman that saw the perill of these two <HI>Knights,</HI> but dyd verie much lament the same, and sayde, that if these two <HI>Knights</HI> dyd die, that the flower of all <HI>knighthood</HI> in the world was fi|nished and ended.

griefe was such, that if h&eacute;e thought to finde his friend the <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Cupid</HI> in the profound depth of the sea, h&eacute;e would haue throwen himselfe therin, as h&eacute;e did into the d&eacute;epe foun|taine of the sauage people, for to take reuengement on that monster who carryed his friend away. So h&eacute;e went foorth of the Citie, and b&eacute;eing in the fields hee dyd alight from his horse, &amp; laid himselfe downe vpon the gr&eacute;ene grasse, whereas hee passed away all that night, with great lamentation, b&eacute;e|wayling y^e misfortune of his perfect friend.

And h&eacute;ere I doe desire you that if you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">oe know any thing of my progeny, to let me vnderstand thereof, for behold I am the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun.</HI> And for that you shall the better beleeue that I doe say, behold h&eacute;ere the marke that I haue vpon my body, for being borne with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ame, I was called by this name, of the <HI>Sun,</HI> at which time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s I was found at the sea in a small boat, by <HI>Florion.</HI> And in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">aying these words&punc; he did open his shirt at his breast, &amp; dyd how the signe of the <HI>Sun,</HI> which was vpon his right side.</P>
<P>So when <HI>Rosicleer</HI> had well vnderstood, what the worthy <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> had sayde, and knowing him by his
<PB REF="128">
face, and by the signe of the <HI>Sun</HI> on his body. He saw before him the present romedy, of all his sorow, which was such, &amp; of so great force, that neuer in all his life he receiued the like. And againe, in knowing his brother the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> he receiued so great ioy and pleasure, and was so glad, that as one halfe amazed and from himselfe, he imbrased him, and so remained a good while without any power to speake, not knowing whether it was of a truth that which he had s&eacute;ene, or some false vision with the which many times he hath be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> deluded.</P>
<P>But after many amorous and comfortable words of the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> he was fully certified, and put out of all doubt, &amp; returned a new to embrace him, shedding many salt tears, which distilled downe his brest, he said as followeth.</P>
<P>Oh diuine power &amp; maiestie of him that the heauens and earth doth gouerne, how haue I deserued so great merite, that at such time as I was in the greatest fauour of fortune, I was vpon a sodaine brought vnto the estate to be ouer throwen downe into the pit: And by th&eacute;e I am reserued &amp; comforted, &amp; haue attained to know him to bee my brother, which is the most famous <HI>knight</HI> in all the world, whom I thought to be my great and mortall enemie.</P>
<P>Oh my Lord and <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> acknowledge this knight of <HI>Cupid,</HI> which is the same <HI>Rosicleer,</HI> who you going in the small bark at the Iland of the gyant, did deliuer fro~ death: &amp; although I doe not deserue so great a benefit, yet I giue you to vnderstand that I am your brother, and both borne at one time &amp; at one byrth, of the high &amp; mighty em|presse <HI>Briana,</HI> at such time as she was at the Monestary of the Riuer: being with childe, by our high &amp; mighty father the Emperour <HI>Trebatio</HI> And by a misfortune which happe|ned vnto the nurse, who did nourish bring and vs vp for hir owne children, you were lost in a small boate, which by the furious force of a mighty deepe&punc; &amp; perillous Riuer, and with the swift course therof, you were caried into the maine sea,
<PB N="122" REF="128">
and ther was tossed vp &amp; downe&punc; till such time as you were found by <HI>Florion,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Persia.</HI></P>
<P>The two pages which was in another quadran hard by to watch them&punc; with the noise which the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> did make at such time as he arose out of his bed, they did a|wake, &amp; heard all that passed betwixt the two <HI>Knights:</HI> who being almost from themselues with the great ioy &amp; pleasure they receiued, they toke a torch that was light in that qua|dran, &amp; without making themselues ready, they went run|ning vnto the place wheras the Emperour <HI>Trebatio</HI> &amp; the empresse <HI>Briana</HI> lay, &amp; were a sl&eacute;epe. And neuer rested knock|ing &amp; giuing great blowes at the dore, till such time as they were answered by the gard, that kept them. And the pages in great hast willed them to open the dore, for that they brought vnto the Emperour, the most ioyfullest newes that euer in all his life he receiued.</P>
<P>The gard who did know the pages by their speach b&eacute;eing very much amazed therat, did open the dore, and they with|out any staying, went in with the burning torch in their hands, wheras the Emperour &amp; the empresse were a sl&eacute;epe, and with a high and loud voice, they sayd: Oh high &amp; migh|tie Emperour <HI>Trebatio,</HI> and you soueraigne Empresse <HI>Bri|ana,</HI> arise vp from your beads, and you shall s&eacute;e the <HI>knight</HI> of the sun and the <HI>knight</HI> of <HI>Cupid</HI> aliue. And by the great pro|uidence of God, they are knowne to be bretheren. The one is the gentleman of the Sunne, and the other is <HI>Rosicleer,</HI> both your lost sonnes.</P>
<P>So when the Emperour <HI>Trebatio</HI> and the Empresse <HI>Briana</HI> heard that newes of so great ioy and pleasure, without any more tarrying, they arose out of their beds, and couered them selues with certaine mantells, which were very rich, and in great hast they forthwith went <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">nto the quadran or lodging whereas they left them. So when the Empresse came vnto their lodging, she did behold <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">he christalline face of <HI>Rosicleer,</HI> who did know the same,
<PB REF="129">
although she had not s&eacute;ene him of long time: &amp; againe, h&eacute;e was very much growne in bignesse of his body &amp; person.</P>
<P>But when she was fully certified that to be most true which was told hir, without tarrying for the Emperour she ran vnto him, &amp; did imbrace him with great loue &amp; ioy, and toke him out of the armes of the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> who was in his shirt, &amp; embraced with him. But the great ioy, which the Empresse receiued, to haue him in hir armes, was such, that she had no power to speake in a great space. But in the end, with shedding of great abundance of teares, she did re|prehend him, for being so long away from hir. In this time, the Emperour came &amp; did imbrace the knight of the Sun, with so great pleasure, that scarcely he could k&eacute;epe himselfe vpright. Who when he saw the Emperour, he kneeled down before him, &amp; asked of him his hands for to kisse them, &amp; said: It may please your highnesse to giue vnto me your hands, as vnto the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> your faithfull seruant, where with I may wholy &amp; intirely reioyce my selfe, &amp; enioy that great benefit, which the high gods, this night hath permit|ted that I should know for father, him whom vnto their di|uine power doth make equall. The <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> had no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> more time for to speak, for that the Emperour did embrace<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> him, &amp; made him to arise from the ground, &amp; kissed him with great loue, as much for that he was the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> as for that hee knew him to bee his childe.</P>
<P>And in shedding many teares, which ranne downe by thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> ch&eacute;ekes, for great ioy, he embraced him again, &amp; said. Oh <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> loyall &amp; faithfull friend, and louing sonne, with what word<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> shall I giue thanks, vnto my soueraigne Lord &amp; god, for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> great benefit which he hath shewed vnto me, this night, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> acknowledge my selfe to be father vnto him who is the fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> wer of all knighthood in the world, &amp; without knowing hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> to be sonne, is the onely person that I most loued an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> made accompt of in all the world.

<PB N="123" REF="129">
what to say, but to receiue it for so great a merit, that it s&eacute;e|meth vnto me that I doe lack force and strength for to con|ceiue it, In this time the pleasant &amp; amorous words which passed betwixt the faire Empresse <HI>Briana</HI> &amp; hir son <HI>Rosicleer,</HI> was with so great ioy &amp; pleasure, &amp; they receiued so great contentment, that I know not wherto to compare it, but vn|to that ioy which the Emperour <HI>Trebatio</HI> &amp; the Empresse <HI>Briana</HI> receiued, when they met together in the monestarie of the Riuer, after long time that the Emperour was ab|sent. So with this soueraigne ioy the Empresse did not re|member the knight of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> till such time as <HI>Rosicleer</HI> said: May it please your highnesse to speake vnto my bro|ther the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> &amp; to acknowledge him for the best son that euer was borne of mother. Then the Empresse all astonyed &amp; amazed, as one awaked out of hir sl&eacute;epe vpon a sodaine, she left <HI>Rosicleer</HI> &amp; went vnto the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> who was still in his shirt, &amp; at the opening of his shirt b&eacute;e|fore, she did s&eacute;e the signe of the <HI>Sunne</HI> that was on his brest, wherat she receiued so great ioy &amp; pleasure, that if the Em|perour had not ben who did sustaine hir, she had fallen down vnto the ground. Then the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> did kn&eacute;ele down before hir, &amp; toke hir hands &amp; kissed them very often, till such time as she being rauished with ioy, threw hir armes about his neck, &amp; fell downe vpon him, and kissing him on that faire face, with a terrible sigh of great loue she said.</P>
<P>Oh <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> the loyall and perfect friend of my Lord the emperour <HI>Trebatio,</HI> how shall I now reioyce my selfe in this great benefit which my Lord God hath shewed vnto m&eacute;e, to haue the knowledge of so worthie a sonne, if the feare which I haue of Fortune doe not disturbe me, in remembring the solitary life which I lead, and re|loycing my selfe in your childhood and with what sodayne chaunge Fortune did carrye you away from me. Likewise the great sorrow and griefe which I receiued for your loue was such, that as yet I am not perfect in my selfe, neither
<PB REF="130">
can I bel&eacute;eue that in one who was inuironed with so great sorrow &amp; bitter anguish, should receiue so great mirth and ioy, so that in the remembrance of all troubles past, if it should not be reioyced with this present ioy, to mitigate the fury therof, my feminine force &amp; strength were not iufficient to suffer the fury of this great pleasure the which is come vnto me, in acknowledging such a valiant &amp; worthy <HI>knight</HI> to be my sonne: Oh how now doe I giue great thanks vnto my God, for the trauailes &amp; troubles, which your losse &amp; the absence of my Lord the Emperour hath caused vnto me, see|ing that I am now paied with so high a gift, &amp; ioyfull reward. Saying these &amp; many other words, the Empresse <HI>Briana</HI> had the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> so fast imbraced in hir armes, with hir face ioyning vnto his, that hee had no power to make any answere. And for that these two bretheren were still in their shirts, the pages which were nigh them in the quadran, had belonging vnto them two mantels, wherwith they did couer themselues, &amp; the <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Cupid</HI> with the greatest pleasure that euer he felt in all his life, went &amp; kneeled down before the Emperour &amp; said.</P>
<P>Let it please your soueraigne highnesse to know m&eacute;e the <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Cupid,</HI> who hath not receiued small trauaile for your absence, &amp; for the losse of my brother the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> in s&eacute;eking of you both in strange Countries, very far &amp; aparted fro~ these countries, although it was not in so ample maner, as was requisite to the seruice of my Lord the Em|perour <HI>Trebatio,</HI> for that at that time we had him rather for an enimie then for a Father, but for the accomplishment of that which I was bound vnto my Lady the Empresse. And for to know who was the occasion that my Lady the Em|presse should lead so straight &amp; solitary a life, which she main|tained in the monestarie of the Riuer, which was a thing that touched me very much. But now knowing the occasion &amp; ground therof, I doe not meruaile so much, but onely how she could sustain hir self &amp; liue one moment without his pre|sence
<PB N="124" REF="130">
And againe if she had not said that he was called the prince <HI>Edward,</HI> I doe beleeue that she wold not haue ben decei|ned, &amp; being innocent, she did not mistrust any such deceit.</P>
<P>So vath no lesse ioy and pleasure then vnto the knight of the <HI>Sun,</HI> the Emperour did imbrace him, &amp; made him to arise from the ground &amp; said: Oh my son <HI>Rosicleer,</HI> how it seemeth vnto me that you were not content, neither receiued any pleasure at this deceit or pollicy, as you doe say I vsed with the Empresse your mother, but in consideration of the fruit that I receiued in doing the same, I may compare it vnto your lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> suffering &amp; being quiet, &amp; delating of the time that I could not receiue the great ioy &amp; pleasure that I should in the acknowledging of such a Sun.

The fruit which proc&eacute;eded therof is sufficient to excuse that errour done, if it had ben of greater importaunce, but what reason haue I to excuse my selfe from the occasion that made me to doe it. Then <HI>Rosicleer</HI> not a little abashed at that which the Emperour had said vnto him, answered: If the ouer-plus o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> the reason which I haue to reioyce mee in the acknow|ledging of such a father.

And because I doe find my selfe not worthy to deserue so great a benef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">, I did make detraction thereof, till this time should supply the great lacke which was in my valour. So that your highnesse may of truth vnderstand, that all that which happened vnto me by the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> my brother, had beene done by some other <HI>Knight.</HI> First I would haue consented to the death, then with so great shame to haue ac|knowledged my selfe to b&eacute;e sonne vnto such parents.

<PB REF="131">
but that the Empresse and the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> came vnto them, &amp; altogether they did a new embrace each other, in such sort, that they had no time for to speake, &amp; the ioy &amp; pleasure was so much in the Empresse <HI>Briana,</HI> that sh&eacute;e was almost from hir selfe, &amp; could not well satisfie hir eies in the behol|ding of hir sonnes, &amp; shewed vnto the emperour the signes&punc; tokens which they had vpon their brests, &amp; brought them in|to the world at their birth. So that betwixt them there pas|sed a great discourse of many things, which did greatly aug|ment their ioy &amp; pleasure, of all that had happened vnto the~, that if I should h&eacute;ere make perticuler relation, I should ne|uer make an end, therfore to auoide tediousnesse I doe let it passe, it is sufficient that the readers heere of doe vnderstand the great reason, as well of the parents as of the children, for to recoice themselues of this new &amp; sodaine pleasure. In this time it was published throughout all the pallace, these good &amp; strange newes, &amp; the noise &amp; rushing was so great a|mongst them with the hast they made for to goe &amp; see their new princes, that all the whole citie was in a rumour &amp; tu|mult, suspecting that it had ben some other thing, &amp; was the occasion that there resorted much people vnto the Pal|lace, in so great abundance, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> he pallace was full, &amp; coul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> no more enter. Likewise the st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s had so great prease, that one could scarce passe by another. But when it was know|en vnto all people of the acknowledging of their new prin|ces, ther was so great plesure amongst them, that in a short time all the whole Citie was so lightsome, as at noone daies with the great light of Bonefires &amp; Torches that was in euery street therof, with many pastimes &amp; new inuentions of so great mirth, that it s&eacute;emed that ther were ioyned to|gether all the pastimes and pleasures in the world. The royall Princesse <HI>Claridiana</HI> was not the last that came for to see these new Princes, for that so soone as she heard of the great ioy which was caused by this new and straunge newes, sh&eacute;e arose ont of hir bed, and couered hir selfe with

a precious and rich robe, lined with Martines furre, which was brought hir by hir Damselles, and hir golden hayre hanging downe, with so great beautie, that sh&eacute;e was est&eacute;e|med rather for some diuine Goddesse, then any humane creature. She went vnto the place whereas the Emperour and the Empresse with their sonnes, were embracing one another. And for that hir Gentlewomen went b&eacute;efore hir, with lyght Torches in theyr handes, euerie one dyd giue place vnto hir, and did receiue hir with great honour and curtesie. But with a gratious and smiling countenance ac|companied with great seuerity, sh&eacute;e left them all, and went and did embrace the worthy <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> and saide: If that by the force of my armes, worthie &amp; valiant <HI>Prince,</HI> did cause you to receiue any anger and griefe, when I made you to be knowen for the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> with the same armes I wil now make satisfaction of my fault, in embrasing of you, as the son of the Emperour <HI>Trebatio,</HI> and of my Lady the Empresse <HI>Briana.</HI> The great pleasure which the worthie <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> receiued of this embracing ought not to b&eacute;e compared vnto that which was the occasion that h&eacute;e came vnto the knowledge of his father and brother. But this may well b&eacute;e saide, that h&eacute;e could not receiue greater pleasure and contentment, if at that time the whole world and all the riches therin had b&eacute;en giuen vnto him, for when he felt himselfe touched with those delicate armes &amp; warlike hands, h&eacute;e thought verily that in al his life h&eacute;e could not re|ceiue the like glorie, and humbling himselfe very much, with a m&eacute;eke voice he said: As it was perillous vnto the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> that rigorous encounter, which by your strong arme (worthy princesse) he receiued, yet this soueraigne and great benefit, which as son vnto the Emperour <HI>Trebatio</HI> I haue receiued, I doo acknowledge my selfe to bee fully sa|tisfied and paide of that high recompence, although it was not so small the harme which I receiued by that encounter, that I think to receiue any satisfaction, but will rather put m&eacute;e in farther perill and daunger. The Princesse <HI>Claridiana</HI>
<PB REF="132">
dyd very well vnderstand the last words that were spoken by the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> but dissembling with him she left him and went vnto the <HI>knight</HI> of <HI>Cupid,</HI> &amp; said: Let it be in good time the acknowledging of the <HI>knight</HI> of <HI>Cupid,</HI> for that ther was no cause sufficient, being lesse the~ this, for to make peace with him, who in this battell did shew so much enmi|tie. And for the part that I haue therin, if that by any other <HI>knight</HI> the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> should be put into so great ex|tremitie, I say I am very glad for y^t it happened to be done by you. For to conclude, it was gods plesure, that all bounty and goodnesse in the world should consist in the blood of the Emperor <HI>Tiebatio,</HI> wherin the <HI>knight</HI> of <HI>Cupid</HI> is pertaker with the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> so that it is not much to be mer|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ailed at, that the bounty of the one and of the other should bee equall. So after that <HI>Rosicleer</HI> had answered the royall Princesse <HI>Claridiana,</HI> straight way came vnto them, the two worthie Princes <HI>Brandizel</HI> and <HI>Clauerindo,</HI> who when they heard the newes, almost fro~ themselues with the great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">oye which they receiued, they came in great hast for to&punc; see their good friend the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> whom they did embrace with so gret loue, as though they wold neuer haue separated themselues.

<P><PB N="126" REF="132">And as the <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Cupid</HI> looked round about him on euerie side, and could not s&eacute;e his faythfull friend the King <HI>Sacridoro,</HI> being somwhat troubled therwith, he did enquire after him, and there lacked not them which did tell him, that when the battaile was concluded b&eacute;etwixt him &amp; the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> that hee was seene to go foorth of the Citie ve|ry sorrowfull and comfortlesse, but they knew not whether hee wae gone.

And when they had brought him to himselfe againe, one of the <HI>Knights</HI> saide.</P>
<P>What doo you make h&eacute;ere sir <HI>Knight,</HI> that you doo not goe and help to celebrate this great mirth &amp; ioy which is made, for the acknowledging of the new princes of <HI>Greece?</HI> What feasts and reioycings b&eacute;e these, saide the King <HI>Sacridoro,</HI> I for my part am more fitter to command to make preparati|on for my buriall, then to celebrate any Feastes.

<P>Yea surely, that hee is, said the <HI>knight,</HI> but and you will not beel&eacute;eue m&eacute;e, lift vp your eyes and looke towards the Citie, and you shall s&eacute;e the great Feasts and triumphs which are

The king <HI>Sac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">idoro,</HI> who was no lesse amazed then ioyefull at those newes, looked towards the Citie, and saw that with the cressets, fires, and other lights, as though the Citie had b&eacute;ene on fire. In great hast he arose vp, and the <HI>knights</HI> which came to seeke him, fetched his horse, who was loose in y^e field, and bridled him, the~ they all together leaped vpon their hor|ses, and went towards the mighty pallace, and met with so many maskes and other kindes of pleasure, that almost they could not passe through the str&eacute;etes. And when they came wheras the <HI>Emperour</HI> &amp; the <HI>Princes</HI> were, this good king was knowen by them straight by the deuice of his armour, &amp; h&eacute;e who first went foorth for to receiue him, was the Emperor <HI>Trebatio,</HI> who clasping his armes about his neck, saide.</P>
<P>Now is all my desire accomplished (worthie King) for that I am come to the knowledge of him, who for that h&eacute;e would not loose the <HI>knight</HI> of <HI>Cupid,</HI> his faithfull friend, did abhorre his life, &amp; sought his owne death in the deepe foun|taine of the <HI>Sauages,</HI> wheras he could haue no other hope but to die the death: Oh happy and fortunate son <HI>Rosicleer,</HI> that could obtaine so high and faithful a friend.

<P>_THe next day in the morning the reioycing &amp; pleasure that was in the great city of <HI>Con|stantinople,</HI> with the inuentions that the ci|tizens had, the more to increase the same, was in such sort, that the strange <HI>Knights,</HI> which found themselues present therat, had great reason to say that it was the best &amp; most richest citie that any prince had in all the world, &amp; the people thereof so loyall &amp; faithfull as any subiects might possibly be. Likewise the Gr&eacute;ekish <HI>knights</HI> mounted vpon very good horses, garni|shed and b&eacute;etrapped with very rich cloth of Golde and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">, and did passe throughout all the great Citie, and

And for that they were subiects vnto the Emperour <HI>Trebatio,</HI> they did as well shew themselues very gallant &amp; ioyfull, in acknowledging of their new princes. And all of them went &amp; did kisse their hands, who receiued them with great loue, embrasing of them &amp; acknowledging some of the~ for very good &amp; faithfull friends, more then for subiects, but in especiall, the good &amp; valiant prince <HI>Rodafeo,</HI> prince of the <HI>Rhodes,</HI> &amp; <HI>Rodamarte,</HI> &amp; other valiant princes &amp; <HI>knights,</HI> which the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> in the Iust, did know them to b&eacute;e of great bounty, &amp; worthy to be est&eacute;emed. So this day the em|perour <HI>Trebatio</HI> did inuite to dyne with him, all princes &amp; <HI>Knights</HI> of fame, as well strangers as of his countries, that were in the court. And with the great importunance of him and of the Empresse <HI>Briana,</HI> of force ther must remaine with them that day the faire princes <HI>Lindabrides,</HI> who with a bet|ter good will, would haue remained in the place, whereas she had little securitie of hir loue, in the princesse <HI>Claridiana:</HI> and for that as then it was not a time to take any armour, the emperour, princes &amp; knights, did aparell &amp; adornat them|selues, with cloth of gold and silk, of great valour, and was conformable vnto their high estates. At which time y^e prin|ces <HI>Claridiana,</HI> did not forget the rich apparell, the which hir damsels brought for hir from <HI>Trapisond,</HI> the which in con|tention of the princes <HI>Lindabrides,</HI> she did put on, and was so well garnished, that it might well be said, that the stones &amp; pearles that was on it, to be worth halfe some kingdome.</P>
<P>So likewise the Empresse, who was as braue and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> gallant as the other two, came forth, and all thr&eacute;e on hors<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> backe, they went to heare diuine seruice, at a Monestar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> that was without the Citie, in a faire fresh and gr&eacute;en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> f&eacute;elde, with whom there went out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> great a number o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> knights for to beare them company, that the str&eacute;etes of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">

But before him ther came forth, all those princes &amp; <HI>knights</HI> of greatest estima<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ion of <HI>Greece,</HI> so gallantly apparailed and furnished, that it did augment very much his great estate.</P>
<P>So after them came the good Emperour, in the midst b&eacute;e|twixt his sons, all mounted vpon great &amp; mighty horses, so gallant &amp; well proporsioned, that it might well be said, that in all the world ther were not thr&eacute;e <HI>knights</HI> of so gallant a semblance, as they were. And the contentment was so great which all their louing subiects did receiue, that they did con|temne with an other to put themselues in places where as best they might recreate themselues in the s&eacute;eking of them. Likewise, all the windowes of the Citie were full of dam|sels &amp; gentlewomen, not a little wondering at their strange &amp; big proportions, giuing great thankes &amp; praise vnto God, for that in all this time he did preserue, defend &amp; k&eacute;epe them. And by reason that the Emperour was in the inchantment of <HI>Lindaraza</HI> in the prime of his y&eacute;eres, they all thr&eacute;e did so much resemble the one the other, that they could scant b&eacute;e knowen the one from the other, but that his sons were som|what bigger of body then their father was. So after them came the faire Empresse <HI>Briana,</HI> vpon a Moyle, very richly garnished &amp; betrapped. And the king <HI>Sacridoro</HI> did lead him by the bridle, the empresse was so gallant &amp; faire, that in all the whole empire of <HI>Greece</HI> could not be found neither lady or damsell, that being put before hir, but that she had great vantage ouer them, except it were the excellent beautie, tho two faire ladies &amp; princes, who went the one on the one side and the other on the other of the empresse. One of them was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">nounted vpon a white Unicorne, &amp; the other vpon a white <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">awfery: and the two Princes <HI>Clauerindo</HI> and <HI>Brandizel,</HI> dyd lead them by their bridels.</P>
<P><PB REF="137">And they were of as gentle dispositions of their bodies, as they were faire and beautifull in their faces, that like the beames of the <HI>Sun,</HI> they did dimme the sight of all them that behold them. And amongst the people there was not a little contempt &amp; strife which of these two should be most fairest, &amp; of best proporsion, although much more greater was the con|tention that either of them had in their harts, for the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> for they knew not to which of them he would y&eacute;eld himselfe prisoner, but the force &amp; strength of the presence of eyther of them was such, that it could not be iudged but to be a continuall contention, without hope of any victory, &amp; al|though ther was some vantage in the perillous sight &amp; sur|mounted grace of the royall princesse, more then in the faire Lady, yet considering the long time and great conuersation that she had with the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> was the occasion that ther was such attension within his hart, that he had not so much vnderstanding for to acknowledge the small vaun|tage that was betwixt them, by reason whereof h&eacute;e was brought into that estate, that the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> should ne|uer haue ben by any of them ouercome, except the presence of one of them had lacked. So in this order they went to|wards the monestary, with the Gyants of the princesse, hin|dermost of all them, &amp; their Damsels, very strongly armed for their sauegard. So they issued out of the Citie into the field wheras the monestary was, and there the <HI>Knightes</HI> of <HI>Greece,</HI> as well as the straunge <HI>Knight</HI> did make a great triumph and gallaunt shew with their Horses, and for that they were all lustie and valiaunt <HI>knightes,</HI> and mer|u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ylonslie richly apparailed, and it was a great comfort, ioy and pleasure, vnto all those people which did b&eacute;eholde them.</P>
<P>When they came vnto the Monestarie, the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> did alight from his Horse with a trise, and for that he knew not which of his Ladies he might be bold first to take downe from their Horse, he left them both, and went

Then they altogether entred into the monestary, whereas they heard diuine seruice with great solempnitie, yet the two sons did not so much reioyce them|selues therat, as the Emperour their father did, for that the presence of those faire Ladies did cause <HI>Rosicleer</HI> to call vn|to remembraunce the great beauty of the Princesse <HI>Oliuia,</HI> who was no lesse in degree then any of them, so that there could no ioy nor pastime enter into his hart, that was suffi|ent to take away that great heauinesse that so long time was rooted in him, but rather the conuersation of his parents &amp; of the princes &amp; <HI>Knights,</HI> did cause in him the more sorow, for that he could not occupy himselfe in those d&eacute;epe and pro|found thoughts as he was to doe, and was very desirous to find some meanes, how with reason he might leaue that life which he then lead very much against his will, &amp; s&eacute;eke some other way which was more agreeble vnto his vnfortunate estate. In this day the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> more by diuine in|spiration, then for any duty vnto his parents, did receiue the holy sacrament of baptisme, &amp; did confesse that all those gods in the which he did bel&eacute;eue, to be false &amp; liers, &amp; did returne vnto the law &amp; faith of Christ, with so great will &amp; deter|mined mind, as though he had ben a long time before instruc|ted therin, for h&eacute;e had alwaies before his eyes, &amp; could not be fully satisfied that it should be good, that law in the which he had liued hether to, which was the occasion that with the more ease he did attaine to the perfection of the law of god. In which h&eacute;e continued his life time, like a true &amp; faithfull Christian. At the which the precious Princesse <HI>Lindabri|des</HI> did receiue so great sorrow and griefe, that she s&eacute;emed to prognosticate vnto hir selfe, that the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> was not ordained for hir, neyther for to be Lord and raigne ouer the great Empire of the <HI>Seythians.</HI> And to the contra|rie,

kingdome of <HI>Carmania,</HI> where when h&eacute;e had s&eacute;ene my gr&eacute;at and strange beautie, &amp; I being a damsell and not married, it chanced that h&eacute;e fell in loue with m&eacute;e, and vttered vnto m&eacute;e all his whole mind, but first he told who he was, &amp; requested m&eacute;e to receiue him for my husband. The which, so that it might not b&eacute;e preiudiciall to my honour, nor hurtfull vnto my fame, but profitable vnto my estate, for that he is so high and mighty a prince, &amp; so valiant a <HI>knight,</HI> I did co~clude and grant him my loue, vpon this condition, that first h&eacute;e should doo such feats of armes as I should s&eacute;e &amp; vnderstand, that he was the best &amp; most valiantest <HI>Knight</HI> in all the world, and if not, it was not for him to procure my loue, for y^t I would by no meanes marry with him, neither with any other. For as I haue my selfe in estimation to excel in beautie &amp; high|nesse of birth &amp; estate all the damsels that are now liuing. So likewise h&eacute;e whom I will take for to b&eacute;e my husband, shal surmount all other <HI>knights.</HI> The which condition this <HI>knight</HI> did accept and grant vnto, and moreouer he said, that the choice should b&eacute;e mine to appoint wherin he shuld proue himselfe, and how that he would in all points performe my request, &amp; h&eacute;e would speake no more words therin, till such time as all should be very manifest and plaine. And I being very desirous to know the truth therof, not giuing any cre|dit vnto those mightie acts which I herd to be told of him, I caused an vnckle of mine to come vnto m&eacute;e, who was ve|ry expert in the art magicke, and I desired him that by his art hee wold aduertise wherin and how I should proue this <HI>knight</HI> to b&eacute;e (as it was reported) the best <HI>knight</HI> in all the world. Who after that h&eacute;e well perused his bookes &amp; studied in this my request, h&eacute;e tolde m&eacute;e that h&eacute;e had found by his art, that in the Court of the Emperour <HI>Trebatio</HI> in the citie of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> that there should b&eacute;e in this day in the great hall ioyned together the flower of all Knighthoode in the world, and the most famous and valyauntest Princes and <HI>Knights</HI> therein. And that it s&eacute;emed vnto him, that
<PB REF="141">
there was no better opportunitie to accomplish my desire then this, and how that this <HI>Knight</HI> and I should come vn|to this court, and h&eacute;e to defend and maintaine the quarrell, in saying that I am the most precious and fairest Damsell in all the world, against all amorous <HI>Knights</HI> that shall say the contrarie, and h&eacute;e to b&eacute;e the onely <HI>Knight,</HI> aboue all other that dooth deserue my loue. The which counsaile s&eacute;e|med so conformable vnto my great desire, and h&eacute;e graun|ted vnto the same. At the same very instaunt w&eacute;e depar|ted on our iourney, and in the ende of much trauaile w&eacute;e are come hether the selfe same day that the wise man dyd tell m&eacute;e, and according vnto that which I dooe s&eacute;e in this great hall, I doo finde it to b&eacute;e true, although I am doubt|full amongst so goodly a companie of <HI>Knights</HI> to finde a|nie that is to b&eacute;e compared vnto this valyaunt and wor|thie Prince <HI>Rodaran,</HI> and how that the fame of this court is much more then the d&eacute;edes thereof. And for that this our long iourney shall not be ended without receiuing some benefit and profit, h&eacute;ere I doo desire you most high &amp; mightie Emperor, to giue leaue and lisence vnto these your <HI>knights,</HI> that in this case they may procure to do their best, otherwise with great reason they might haue shame to come b&eacute;efore their amorous Dames, if that you too refraine the consent|ment h&eacute;ereof, and not to defend them in this case with all their might &amp; power, but first I doo giue you to vnderstand, that b&eacute;efore that this valiant Prince <HI>Rodaran</HI> doo enter into battell with any of these <HI>knights,</HI> it shall b&eacute;e vpon this con|dition, that if h&eacute;e b&eacute;e by any <HI>knight</HI> ouercome, that both h&eacute;e &amp; I to be prisoners vnto him y^t getteth the victorie, to do with vs all that his will &amp; pleasure shall b&eacute;e. And if it b&eacute;e so that h&eacute;e doth ouercome any <HI>knight,</HI> that likewise in the same or|der he to b&eacute;e his prisoner, to carry him into his Countrie, or to doo his pleasure w^t him. And againe, although the Prince <HI>Rodaran</HI> as one that is without all feare, would in the midst of the place of this great Citie make the proofe of his great
<PB N="134" REF="141">
bounty, for that it should be the more manifest vnto you all: yet I b&eacute;eing no man, and somewhat timerous, for the great loue which I doo beare vnto him, haue requested him that it might not b&eacute;e h&eacute;ere in this citie, for that the imprisonment of so high <HI>Princes &amp; knights</HI> as be h&eacute;ere present, might grow vnto great perill &amp; danger, and great disturbance to vse his will of his prisoners, after they b&eacute;e ouercome. And for that the security of all parts shall be more certaine to auoid the inconueniences that may happen to the contrarie, it shall be good, and seemeth vnto me very conuenient, that these trials do passe at the bridge of the white <HI>Iasper</HI> ston, that which is on the first arme of the fiue Riuers, which runneth into the Riuer of <HI>Danubia,</HI> and runneth into the Sea <HI>Maditaraneo,</HI> which is in the confines &amp; vtter parts of this mightie Em|pire, wheras the Prince <HI>Rodaran</HI> shall tarrie and abide the comming of all such <HI>knights</HI> as will combat in the defence of this demand, and neuer to depart the field till such time as h&eacute;e b&eacute;e ouercome, or else to remaine with the victorie of all <HI>Knights,</HI> of what estate and same so euer they b&eacute;e. And for se|curitie, that y^e prince <HI>Rodaran</HI> shall performe &amp; k&eacute;epe all that is said, according vnto the order of knighthood, h&eacute;e shall giue his gage afore all and vnto all that is in this great hall.</P>
<P>And therewith the Prince <HI>Rodaran</HI> did throw his gantlet so high, that all those which were there might s&eacute;e it, in token of defiaunce. And without saying any more, or dooing any reuerence, they departed out of y^e great hal, leauing amongst all them that were therein a great laughter, as well at the demaund of the Gentlewoman, as at the disposition of the Dwarfes, although they receiued great contentment at the disposition of the <HI>knight,</HI> and ther were many that were ve|ry desirous to make the first proofe with him, and b&eacute;el&eacute;eued of a certaintie, that according as h&eacute;e was of members and stature, that h&eacute;e should b&eacute;e of great force and strength.</P>
<P>With this desire there were diuerse that arose vp from the
<PB REF="142">
table, and went vnto the <HI>Emperour,</HI> &amp; asked lisence that they might go &amp; prooue themselues with that <HI>knight,</HI> amongst the which, the first was that good <HI>Knight Rodamarte,</HI> Prince of the <HI>Rhodes,</HI> a yong <HI>Knight,</HI> &amp; one of the valiantest that was in the <HI>Emperours</HI> Court. Likewise the valiant Prince <HI>Ro|dafeo,</HI> who was also a very good <HI>Knight,</HI> and both of them in loue with faire ladies that were with the Empresse, the one of them was daughter vnto the king of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> called <HI>A|milinia,</HI> &amp; the other was daughter vnto the king of <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> called <HI>Salandria,</HI> who receiuing great contentment of theyr valiant desires &amp; good dispositions, did shew vnto them great fauour &amp; curtesie determining to take them to b&eacute;e their hus|bands. Likewise in this demaund ther lacked not y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> valiant <HI>Brandizel,</HI> who sustained great passions with the griefe that h&eacute;e receiued for the absence of the fayre Princesse <HI>Clarinea,</HI> would in hir absence doo hir this seruice, for that the beauty of that Gentlewoman was nothing in comparison vnto his Lady. And with no lesse good will y^e good king <HI>Sacridoro</HI> came foorth to aske lisence, &amp; after him <HI>Rosicleer,</HI> &amp; the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> all being on foot before the Emperour, did desire him to giue them lisence to giue the first attempt: who with a plea|sant laughter said that he knew not what to say in that case, but did remit it vnto the Princesse <HI>Claridiana,</HI> that she shuld determine what they should doo therin. Who did excuse hir selfe in all that euer sh&eacute;e could, &amp; did remit it vnto the prin|cesse <HI>Lindabrides,</HI> yet for all that it fell out that in the ende shee must n&eacute;eds determine and conclude the great contenti|on that was amongst all those <HI>Knights,</HI> who should b&eacute;e the first that should giue the attempt. So sh&eacute;e concluded that the first enterprise should h&eacute;e giuen by him that dyd first aske lisence of the Emperour, and next vnto him the second that demaunded lisence, and so the third, in the same or|der as they craued lisence. And although it was a griefe vnto them which should b&eacute;e the last, hauing for certayntie that the first would conclude the demaund of <HI>Rodaran,</HI> yet
<PB N="143" REF="142">
for all that they thought the sentence iust and right which was giuen by the royall Princesse <HI>Claridiana,</HI> who if at that time had b&eacute;ene lawfull, with a very good will she wold haue b&eacute;ene the first hir selfe y^t should haue defended hir owne beautie, rather then to haue made the order and repetition sh&eacute;e did vnto the <HI>knights.</HI> The Prince <HI>Rodamarte</HI> would pre|sently haue departed in the demand, but the Emperour by no meanes would consent ther vnto, but said that in all that day they shuld not meddle therin, neither should any <HI>knight</HI> arme himselfe, neither doo any other thing but spend y^e time in pastime &amp; plesure, &amp; celebrate that feast for the acknow|ledging of his sons, &amp; how that they had time inough after|ward to accomplish their desires. So y^t they spent the time in no other thing, but in making of mirth and pastime, with meruailous straunge &amp; new inuentions, holden in the place of that great Citie by the Citizens, that gaue great con|tentment vnto all the <HI>Knights,</HI> who likewise did dance with the Ladies and Damsells of the Empresse, who were verie faire and pleasant. Likewise the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> did dance with y^e princesse <HI>Claridiana,</HI> &amp; with the princesse <HI>Lindabrides,</HI> with so gentle &amp; curteous demeanour, that they receiued so great contentment therein, as to s&eacute;e him in his armour, al|though according vnto his d&eacute;epe thoughts, he had more care to rule his eies to b&eacute;eholde them in equall manner, then h&eacute;e had to k&eacute;epe his f&eacute;ete in compasse in his dauncing. So the night drew on, &amp; all those which dined with the Emperour did likewise sup with him, and after supper they passed away the most part of the night in dauncing and mirth. At which tune the princesse <HI>Lindabrides,</HI> although it was great griefe vnto hir for to depart fro~ the presence of y^e <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> yet would sh&eacute;e returne vnto hir <HI>Chariot.</HI> The Emperor and y^e Empresse did importunate hir very much for to tarry ther, and to remaine in the Pallace, but all that euer they could doe d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">d profit nothing at all. So sh&eacute;e returned vnto hir <HI>Chariot,</HI> accompanied with the Emperour and all the rest
<PB REF="143">
of the Princes and <HI>knights, til</HI> such time as sh&eacute;e was within the <HI>Chariot,</HI> whereas they did all take their leaue of hir, and returned backe, vnto the pallace, which was a great griefe vnto the <HI>Knight of the Sun,</HI> for that h&eacute;e could not carry and remaine to sl&eacute;epe in the <HI>Charior</HI> as he was wont to doo, and no lesse was the griefe of the princesse <HI>Lindabrides</HI> whe~ she saw him depart, and although the acknowledging of y^e <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> did cause hir very much to reioyce for that h&eacute;e was of so high estate, yet she would for hir part haue giuen the halfe of hir lands, vpon the condition that she had neuer knowen him what he was, for that she was better in quiet when sh&eacute;e vnderstood no other thing but onely his great va|l our &amp; bounty, and the name of the <HI>Knight of the Sun,</HI> &amp; the great securitie that sh&eacute;e had to marry with him, then now to know him to b&eacute;e of so high blood and linage, wich the pe|rill that sh&eacute;e doth suspect, and a thing apparaunt b&eacute;efore hir eies, which was the occasion that in all that night sh&eacute;e could not take any rest nor sl&eacute;epe, with the great care and griefe which sh&eacute;e receiued, and hir minde so tumbled &amp; tossed with diuerse such strange thoughts concerning the <HI>Knight of the Sunne,</HI> that neuer in all hir life she found hir selfe in the like confusion. For one way considering with what intent sh&eacute;e departed out of hir owne Countrie, and how that hir bro|ther the Prince <HI>Meridian</HI> was gone and left hir, &amp; another way, the acknowledging of the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> and the renouncing of his law, and likewise the comming of the Princesse <HI>Claridiana,</HI> with hir estate, and surmounting beau|tie, did cause hir to suspect very much that the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> would wholy giue ouer the enterprise that h&eacute;e had taken in hand, so that she did account hir selfe to b&eacute;e the vn|happiest and most vnfortunatest Damsell that was borne into the world, and with the great griefe that this doubtful thought did cause in hir, sh&eacute;e saide.</P>
<P>Oh high and diuine prouidence of the immortall Gods, whom all the whole nation of the Oriental and Septentri|onall

<PB REF="144">
a prisoner; What comfort shall I take s&eacute;eing that I am whithout all remedy? What counsaile shall I take hauing no vnderstanding, neither is there any power to perswade m&eacute;e to reason, but will rather the more increase my sorrow and griefe? What shall I doo, if I doo remaine h&eacute;ere, I shall lack reson to sustaine my selfe, &amp; considering my high estate, will cause a farther griefe: &amp; againe, the sight of the <HI>knight of the Sunne</HI> cannot bee so ioyfull vnto m&eacute;e, as the presence of <HI>Claridiana</HI> will b&eacute;e hurtfull. And if I depart out of this Countrie, and returned vnto mine owne, it will be no other thing but to separate the life and soule from the body. And to liue without the presence of the <HI>Knight of the Sunne,</HI> will b&eacute;e a life vnto m&eacute;e, as vnto those who are in the darke, and see no light. But alasse what do I say, although they receiue nor s&eacute;e no light, yet the paine doth not trouble them: but it I do finde my selfe banished out of the presence of the <HI>knight of the Sunne,</HI> there can b&eacute;e no paine in the world compared vnto that which I shall suffer. Oh <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> how mightie and straunge is your Fortune, that onely in your ha~ds doth remaine the whole remedie of the Princesse <HI>Lin|dabrides,</HI> shee who in beautie and fairenesse is excellent and doth exc&eacute;ede, and amongst all Ladies is the most highest, and yet will let to giue hir remedie, but rather condempne hir vnto cruell death. Wherefore haue I so many Lordshippes and kingdoms, with so many thousaads of people, which the diuine Gods hath giuen vnto mee, when that with all those ioyntly with my straunge &amp; exquisite beautie, I cannot sub|iect the will of one alone <HI>Knight.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The sorrowfull Princesse <HI>Lindabrides</HI> had scarce made an ende of saying these words, when that voyde of all me|morie and vnderstanding, sh&eacute;e remayned vpon hir bed as one that were dead, whereas sh&eacute;e remained all that night, without comming againe to hir selfe. With no lesse sorrow and griefe the worthie <HI>Knight of the Sunne</HI> passed away the night without sl&eacute;epe, calling to minde all that had pas|sed b&eacute;etwixt him and the Princesse <HI>Lindabrides,</HI> and the
<PB N="137" REF="144">
great loue which vnto that day he bare vnto hir, ioyntlye with his meruailous surpassing beautie: which was in such sort figu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ed in his hart, that it made great resistance against the loue which he had vnto the princesse <HI>Claridiana,</HI> in especi|all, when she was not in presence. But being both present, y^e great liking he had of the royall Princes, did almost ouer come him: who at that time neither more nor lesse, did take as little ca~se, as the others did sl&eacute;epe. For that the great loue which she had vnto the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> did not let but put some doubt in that which hir wounded hart so much desired. And although the highnesse of hir estate &amp; the excellency of hir beauty, did almost wholy perswade hir of securitie, that the knight of the <HI>Sun</HI> would not forget hir. Yet the sight of the princes <HI>Lindabrides,</HI> and hir remaining in the court did cause in hir some Ielosie, not knowing what would bee the end of that hir demaund. Likewise she had great doubt in hir hope: For that at such time as the princesse should returne into hir owne country, the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> could not doe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">o the contrary, but to beare hir company, so that the continu|all conuersation of them two together, would be the occasi|on of that, which being in hir presence, might be excused. So with these &amp; such like thoughts, they passed away the night: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">n the which the good knight of <HI>Cupid</HI> neither more nor lesse, did not sl&eacute;epe very much, whose passions are not to be accou~|ed, nor compared with the rest.

It is sufficient that he pas|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ed away the night with no lesse care, then the others that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> haue told you of: although his passions were not so strau~ge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">nto him, as it was vnto the other their griefes. But the fu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e of his sorow was somewhat apeased, with the hope that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e had for to be reuenged on him, who was the occasion of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ll his euill &amp; mortall paine.

Besides all this, this mighty emperour had in his subiection all the kings &amp; lords that were in the orientall part of the <HI>Indians,</HI> vnto the me|ridionall, which are nine kingdomes, all very great &amp; migh|ty, and full of great riches: so that with great reason they might say, that he was the mightiest emperour &amp; king in all the wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">h. Heere the History saith that many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e deceiued to thinke that this mightie empire should be christians, for al|though they haue amongst them some part of the law, which God gaue vnto that great Captayne <HI>Moses,</HI> yet theyr law doeth differ very farre from the true and perfect law of Iesus Christ, for that they bee all Idolaters, and euery one of these kings doeth b&eacute;el&eacute;eue in that which seemeth vn|to him best, for that there is no law nor commaundement to make them incline to anye kinde of goodnesse for the sauegarde of their owne soules. So it happened on a time as this mightie Emperour <HI>Alicandro</HI> was in his
<PB REF="146">
great city of <HI>Neptaya,</HI> which is in <HI>Cataya</HI> the great, very pen|siue &amp; sad, for that hee could h&eacute;ere no newes of the children&punc; y^e Prince <HI>Meridian</HI> &amp; the Princesse <HI>Lindabrides,</HI> reprehending himselfe very much, for hee had so sent them foorth into the world. One day b&eacute;eing accompanied with all his mightye <HI>Knights</HI> &amp; lords his subiects, he receiued so great sorrow and griefe in the remembring of his children, that it caused him to w&eacute;epe. And leaning his ch&eacute;eke vpon one of his hands, h&eacute;e shed forth many salt teares which ran down vpon his white face. The which being s&eacute;ene by those p&eacute;eres his subiects, they were all very much amazed, what should bee the occasion that the Emperour should w&eacute;epe.</P>
<P>So before that any did arise vp to demaund of him the oc|casion, ther arose vp amongst them a king, who was king of <HI>Gedrosia,</HI> an old man of more then one hundreth yeares, who amongst all the rest present, was est&eacute;emed to be the wisest in Astrologie, &amp; deuination, that could be found in all <HI>Asia.</HI> And all they did giue so great credit vnto that which he did tell them should happen, as though it had ben all ready ac|complished: the which king dyd w&eacute;epe very bitterly, &amp; with so great sorrow, that almost he could not speake, but yet he said. <Q>Oh high &amp; mighty king of the <HI>Scythians,</HI> &amp; Emperour of the <HI>Tartarians,</HI> if you had as good iudgement of the know|ledge of things to come h&eacute;ere after, as now to conceiue in matters present, then wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ld you leue of this great w&eacute;epings for your children, who are very well &amp; in health, &amp; in place whereas they are very much honored and had in estimaci|on as they doe deserue.

<P>Without saying any more this old king of <HI>Gedrosia,</HI> did set himselfe downe againe in his place, leauing this mighty em|perour &amp; all the other kings and <HI>Knights</HI> that were in that great hall, very much amazed at the words which hee had spoken, &amp; knew not what to say, but being amazed they did looke one vpon another, &amp; spake neuer a word. But this migh|ty Emperour who alwaies found the prognosticating &amp; de|uining of this old king to be true, yet he thought this to b&eacute;e a thing impossible, &amp; not to giue any credit thervnto, but yet to heare farther what he would say, after a certaine space that he had bethought himselfe, he said.</P>

<P>High and mighty Emperour, the great confidence &amp; trust that you haue in your high estate and power doth cause you to make a iest at these things which I haue told you, for that it s&eacute;emeth a thing impossible, without any consideration, how that ther is no securitie of worldly things, for when a man doth thinke himselfe to be most surest, then he is farthest off, &amp; as it doth happen vnto all estates, so likewise high &amp; migh|ty Princes doe fall and come vnto destruction, euen at such time as they account themselues to be in the greatest fa|uour of Fortune, then is their fall the greater.

<P>Without speaking any more wordes this olde king of <HI>Gedrosia</HI> set himselfe agayne in his place, leauing this mightye Emperour and all those Kings and Nobles that were ther present, much more amazed then they were at the first, although they were fully perswaded and b&eacute;el&eacute;eued of a certainty, that it was impossible to finde in all the world so many <HI>Knightes</HI> that might compare themselues with them that were at that present in that court, no not by a great deale, whith was the occasion that wheras bee|fore they did not giue full credit vnto those wordes which the King <HI>Gedrosia</HI> had sayde. At this time they gaue lesse and made a mocke at him and at his diuinations, but yet for that the Emperour <HI>Alicandro</HI> was verye wise, and hadde great experience of the small security that was in the prosperous estates of this transitorye worlde,
<PB REF="148">
with a wan colour &amp; sorrowfull semblance, he fell in a great imagination &amp; d&eacute;epe thought, musing vpon the words which the King <HI>Gedrosia</HI> had said. And as the Emperour was in this sort a great while without speaking any word, but ve|ry pensiue &amp; heauie, amongst the rest of all those kings &amp; no|bles that were in that great hall, the valiant <HI>Rodaran</HI> arose vp &amp; put himself on foot, who was king of <HI>Arabia,</HI> subiect vnto the Emperour <HI>Alicandro,</HI> a young man, &amp; so valiant, that in all <HI>Asia</HI> there was not a <HI>knight</HI> to be found, that by a great deale was able to compare himself with him in mighty pro|wesse &amp; feates of armes, and for that he was so furious and stubburne, he was feared of all, &amp; all that were in the whole Empire of <HI>Tartaria,</HI> were very desirous to pleasure him, and not one that durst anger him in any respect, except it were that valiant Prince <HI>Meridian,</HI> with whom he would neuer contend nor procure to combat, yet ther was neuer other <HI>knight</HI> nor Giant that euer did abide the battaile with him one houre. This <HI>Rodaran</HI> with great courage and anger, as though fire should proc&eacute;ed out of his eies, b&eacute;egan and said as followeth.</P>
<P>I doe not know high &amp; mighty emperour of <HI>Tartaria,</HI> with what reason is attributed vnto thee the name of the diuine, &amp; the parentage that you haue of the high &amp; diuine Gods, that you doe suffer in your presence, &amp; in the presence of so many mightie kings &amp; lords your subiects, that the king of <HI>Gedro|sia</HI> should be so bold &amp; hardy to speake these blasphemies, the which he hath said, for that I do bel&eacute;eue, that if all the pow|er of the gods, &amp; the rest of all the whole world besides, shuld ioyne themselues together by the Deity that you haue re|ceiued by your predecessors, if they were all ioyned toge|ther, yet were they not sufficient to comprehend this, the which the king hath saide, much lesse the Emperour of <HI>Greece,</HI> and the knights that shall there be assembled and ioyned together.

So that in this sort either they shall remaine the most weakest and cowardliest <HI>knights</HI> in the world, or else I will bring them prisoners b&eacute;efore your presence, for that the king of <HI>Gedrosia</HI> may loose the great feare which he hath conceiued of them.</P>
<P>When h&eacute;e had made an ende of speaking, there was not one King nor <HI>Knight</HI> amongest all them in the great hall that durst make any answere vnto those proude words of <HI>Rodaran,</HI> but onely the king of <HI>Gedrosia,</HI> who rising vpon his f&eacute;ete did answere him, saying.</P>
<P>If thou wert so valiaunt of armes and d&eacute;edes <HI>Rodaran,</HI> as proude in thy words, then should I b&eacute;e fully certified, that thou wouldest b&eacute;e sufficient to accomplish much more then h&eacute;ere thou hast said, and that there were not in all the world a <HI>Knight</HI> that might compare himselfe with th&eacute;e, but for that thy strength and prowesse is far different and con|trarie vnto thy great pride, h&eacute;ere I doo giue th&eacute;e to vnder|stande that this day twelue moneths there shall b&eacute;e such <HI>Knights</HI> assembled and ioyned together in <HI>Constantino|ple,</HI>
<PB REF="149">
that whereas thou shalt exc&eacute;ede them in the one, they shall exc&eacute;ede th&eacute;e in the other. And it shall happen vnto th&eacute;e many houres in the daye that thou shalt acknowledge this to b&eacute;e true, all this which I haue sayde vnto th&eacute;e, al|though at this present it s&eacute;emeth vnto th&eacute;e to be a fable and lye. And I doo desire no other reuengement for the iniury which I haue receiued at thy hands, but onely the repre|hension which thou thy selfe shalt make at such time as it shall b&eacute;e vnto th&eacute;e well knowen. And for that my words shall s&eacute;eme vnto th&eacute;e to be of lesse credit, and that thou shalt haue farther experience of that which I by the starres and celestiall opperations doo vnderstand and know, h&eacute;ere I doo giue th&eacute;e to vnderstand (that if thou doost goe forwards with this enterprise which thou hast promised) thou shalt finde in the Citie of <HI>Constantinople</HI> a woman, who with hir singular beuty &amp; fairnes shal far excel the beuty of y^e qu&eacute;ene of <HI>Carmania,</HI> thy lady, &amp; with the great force &amp; strength of hir arme, shall abate thy courage and make th&eacute;e to y&eacute;eld.</P>
<P>And therewith h&eacute;e held his peace, but the great pride of that valiant <HI>Rodaran</HI> encreased, in such sort, when h&eacute;e heard those words of the olde King <HI>Gedrosia,</HI> and his anger was so great, that if the Emperour and those kings which were there present had not disturbed him, with determined pur|pose h&eacute;e went towards him to haue throwen him out at the window. But when h&eacute;e saw that h&eacute;e could not execute his pretence, with great anger and courage he went out of the hall, swearing great oathes, that h&eacute;e would accomplish and performe all that which hee had promised, &amp; that b&eacute;eing finished, to take reuengement of the great iniurie which h&eacute;e had receiued of the olde king <HI>Gedrosia.</HI> Wherewith h&eacute;e left all that were ther present greatly amazed at his pride and hardinesse. And so departed vnto the kingdome of <HI>Carmania,</HI> whereas all his ioy was, for that h&eacute;e was amorous of the Qu&eacute;ene of <HI>Carmania,</HI> who was in great royaltie and estate, and very faire. And in processe of time finding himselfe in great fauour with hir, and hauing hir aide and help to his

contentment, h&eacute;e straight way gaue hir to vnderstand of all that which had passed with him in the court of the mightie Emperour of <HI>Tartaria,</HI> and of his promise that h&eacute;e had made b&eacute;efore all those which were there present, in saying that he could not in any maner of wise excuse the same, but that h&eacute;e must n&eacute;edes b&eacute;egin the enterprise of his iourney towardes <HI>Greece</HI> out of hand. The Qu&eacute;ene <HI>Carmania</HI> was very wise and of a good iudgement and vnderstanding, &amp; if it had b&eacute;ene in hir power, sh&eacute;e would very faine haue hindred this iour|ney, and for that sh&eacute;e knew very well the condition of this valiaunt and stout <HI>Rodaran,</HI> and that there were none that were able to perswade him from the contrarye of this his determined purpose, sh&eacute;e wold not by any means say ought against him, but with a merrie countenaunce sh&eacute;e dyd of|fer hir selfe to goe with him into <HI>Greece,</HI> vpon co~dition that h&eacute;e would grant vnto hir one thing that she would demand of him, if his pleasure were that sh&eacute;e should goe with him. The which with a very good will hee did graunt vnto hir. And sh&eacute;e promised him to beare him companie. Then dyd they ordaine all things necessary, for to carry with him on his iourney, but halfe the y&eacute;ere was almost past before they could begin to trauaile, for that the qu&eacute;ene co~manded a net of yron to be made, very arteficially &amp; cunningly wrought, &amp; it could not b&eacute;e made an ende of in any shorter time.</P>
<P>And although that <HI>Rodaran</HI> did often times aske where|fore the same was made, yet for all that the Qu&eacute;ene would neuer tell him, but after that this net was made, and all things in a redinesse, this valiant <HI>Rodaran</HI> &amp; the Qu&eacute;ene de|parted out of the Countrie of <HI>Carmania,</HI> &amp; carried in theyr company certaine <HI>knights</HI> and <HI>Pages</HI> which were necessary, and after that they had passed many and diuerse countries, they came vnto the port of <HI>Tenedon,</HI> whereas they did im|barke themselues, and tooke their way towards <HI>Greece.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="150">And although there happened vnto this mightie Prince in his iourney many strange and wonderfull things, b&eacute;ecause it is not necessarie, this Historie doth not make any men|tion thereof, but onely in the ende of many daies and great trauaile, they ariued in <HI>Greece,</HI> not far from <HI>Constanti|nople.</HI> This valiaunt <HI>Rodaran</HI> was determined to execute his enterprise within the Citie of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> but the Qu&eacute;ene of <HI>Carmania</HI> did disturbe him, and sayde, that now was the time come that h&eacute;e should performe the gift that h&eacute;e had promised hir b&eacute;efore h&eacute;e did depart out of <HI>Carmania,</HI> which was, that the contension which should passe with him and the <HI>Knights of Greece,</HI> should not b&eacute;e executed in the Citie of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> but in the place whereas sh&eacute;e would appoynt it. The which <HI>Rodaran,</HI> although it did grieue him very much, yet durst h&eacute;e not say against it b&eacute;e|cause h&eacute;e promised hir. So they nauigated all along the shoare, till they came vnto the Bridge called Iasp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">, which is the first passage ouer <HI>Danubia</HI> towards the sea, and was the most strongest that was vpon all the riuer, and furni|shed full of Towres and battlements, and especiallie thr&eacute;e towers of great force and admiration, the one at the entrie vppon the Bridge, and the other in the midst, and the third at the farther ende, all wrought with fine white Iasper stone, of so great strength, that it s&eacute;emed impossible to b&eacute;e taken or wonne by force of armes. And this Bridge was mayntained and kept by the Emperour of <HI>Greece,</HI> by rea|son that the people which doth inhabit on the one side of the fiue armes which proc&eacute;edeth from <HI>Danubia,</HI> and runneth into the sea <HI>Fuxino,</HI> they are very barbarous, furious, and beastlie, and many times they doo enter into that Countri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> and doo very much harme therein. And although the Em|perour would make a conquest ouer them, as diuers times h&eacute;e hath put it in practise, yet hee cannot, for that they haue neyther Cities, Townes, nor villages, neyther any dwel|ling houses, but onely great Caues vnder the ground, whereas they doo make theyr habitation, b&eacute;ecause they are so beastlie and brutish. In consideration whereof it dyd
<PB N="143" REF="150">
behoue the Emperour to haue that bridge very stronge and exc&eacute;eding well kept, and it was for that alongst the Riuer there was none other passage. When this valiant <HI>Rodaran</HI> and the Qu&eacute;ene ariued at that bridge, &amp; saw it to b&eacute;e a place very conuenient for their purpose, straight way the prince <HI>Rodaran</HI> did prepare himselfe for to win the same, &amp; b&eacute;eing armed &amp; in very good order, hee tooke the qu&eacute;ene by the hand, and without any more company they went towards y^e gate of the bridge, &amp; knocked therat, &amp; for that they were all a|lone, the gate was straight way opened. When they were entered within the first Tower, this valiant <HI>Rodaran</HI> com|manded those that were the keepers therof, that they should y&eacute;eld vp the towers and bridge, and that they should depart with quietnesse. Who s&eacute;eing him alone &amp; they so many, wold not obey his commandement, but did procure to defend the towers &amp; the bridge, and wold not suffer him to perswadge any farther. But this valiant <HI>Rodaran</HI> in a smal time did so b&eacute;ehaue himselfe amongst them, that wounding and killing the most part of them, the rest were constraynd &amp; thought it good for the sauegard of their liues to y&eacute;eld, and to doo all that h&eacute;e commaunded them. And so they deliuered vnto him all the keyes of the gates and towers, and departed thence at their liberty, with the losse of the most part of their com|panions, and although they were ashamed so manye to b&eacute;e slaine and ouercome by one alone <HI>Knight,</HI> which made them to refraine comming into the Emperours presence, yet ther did not lack (who b&eacute;efore <HI>Rodaran</HI> did enter into <HI>Con|stantinople</HI>) that did aduise the Emperour thereof. At such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ime as h&eacute;e came thether, h&eacute;e was very angrie with him|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">elfe, for that h&eacute;e was so bolde to giue that enterprise, and if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">t had not b&eacute;ene for the disturbing of their great feasts and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">riumphs which were made there for their sons, h&eacute;e would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">aue sent thether such as should haue rewarded him vnto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">is contentment for his boldnesse.

that h&eacute;e had so good opportunity, whereby h&eacute;e should receiue his p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">yment for his boldnesse, and small account that h&eacute;e made of him and his estate. So when this valyant <HI>Roda|ran</HI> and the Qu&eacute;ene of <HI>Carmania</HI> saw themselues Lords and gouernours ouer the whole bridge and their Towers, they commaunded all those that came in theyr companie to enter in thereat, whereas they dyd establish their abiding, and caused the ship wherein they came thether, which was at the sea, to enter into the riuer, and to surge close vnto the bridge, wheras they did let fall their ancker, and made hir very fast, for that in the same Ship <HI>Rodaran</HI> did determine, hauing ouercome the most part of the best and principallest <HI>knights in all Greece,</HI> to put them prisoners into the same ship, and returne with them into his owne Countrie. So af|ter that the Qu&eacute;ene of <HI>Carmania</HI> had well perused the scitu|ation of the bridges, &amp; of the towers, she saw that the tower that was in the midst of the Bridge was made in such sort, that beneath it was round like vnto an arke and hollow, without any gate, but as broad as the bridge was, wheras sh&eacute;e caused the net of yron to b&eacute;e hanged in the highest part of the hollownesse within, in such sort, that it could not b&eacute;e s&eacute;ene nor descerned without, but it was so large, that it oc|cupied all the bignesse of the vaut within, and in such sort the Qu&eacute;ene of <HI>Carmania</HI> caused it to be hanged, that in pul|lling of a cord, ordained for that purpose, the whole n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">t should fall downe.</P>
<P>When <HI>Rodaran</HI> saw the net hanged vp and put in good or|der, he was very desirous to know to what purpose it was put there, and did importune the qu&eacute;ene so much, that in the end sh&eacute;e was constrained to declare it vnto him, saying.</P>

Thou shalt vnderstand <HI>Rodaran,</HI> that I am a <HI>knight</HI> of the Emperour <HI>Trebatio,</HI> one of them that thou didst dis|ceiue openly in the great hall of his Court. And for the loue of a faire Lady whom I doe serue, I am come hether, for to chastise th&eacute;e, for thy great folly, which thou spakest beefore the most fairest damsels, &amp; most valiantest knights in all the world.

And by reason that the valy|ant <HI>Rodaran</HI> was bigger of body &amp; of more force &amp; strength, he stroke the prince in such sort, that he ouerthrew him horse &amp; all to the ground, so cleane void of all memory, as though he had stroke against a mighty rocke, &amp; he broching his horse with the spurs, passed ouer the Prince, who was so euill in|treated, that he could not arise, till such time as <HI>Rodaran</HI> re|turned with his horse, &amp; alighted from him, &amp; toke his sword from his girdell, &amp; his healme of his head, &amp; did help to raise him from the ground.

<P>Well said she, for that you shall s&eacute;e how much you are de|ceiued, h&eacute;ere you shall remaine with vs till such time as the best <HI>knights</HI> of the Emperours court be brought hether to beare you co~pany. Then <HI>Rodaran</HI> did cause him to be vnar|med, &amp; to b&eacute;e put at his foot a great chaine, &amp; commanded him to be put into a d&eacute;epe and darke dungeon, whereas he was certaine daies, with more sorrow &amp; griefe to loose the victo|ry in that demand, then to be ouercome as he was. Then his page which came with him, departed from thence, and retur|ned vnto <HI>Constantinople,</HI> with a sorrowfull hart.</P>
<P><PB REF="155">And one day at such time as the Emperour with his sons, and all the <HI>knights,</HI> in the court were in great pastimes and pleasures, sporting themselues, with dauncing in companie with the Empresse &amp; hir Ladies &amp; gentlewomen, &amp; the prin|ces <HI>Lindabrides, &amp; Claridiana</HI> with them. The page entred in|to the court with so great sorow &amp; griefe, that he was scarce able to speake, for to tell the heauy newes of the prince <HI>Ro|damarte,</HI> yet as well as he could he gaue them to vnderstand of all that he had passed with <HI>Rodaran,</HI> at the which they did all meruaile very much for that <HI>Rodamarte</HI> was had in re|putation for one of the best <HI>knights</HI> that was in all the em|pire of <HI>Greece,</HI> &amp; the emperour receiued great griefe that it fell so out, that by one alone <HI>knight</HI> h&eacute;e should b&eacute;e ouercome. Then straight way that valiant &amp; est&eacute;emed prince <HI>Rodafeo,</HI> who was the second by lot to go forth, without speaking any word departed out of the great hall, the emperour s&eacute;eing his determination did commend him vnto god, &amp; so did the rest that were ther present, but especially his lady the princesse, who when she saw him depart, hir hart was ready to part a sunder. When this valiant prince came vnto his lodging, h&eacute;e armed himselfe with very strong &amp; rich armour, &amp; com|manded his horse to be trapped with cloth of gold, which did signifie vnto all men his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> &amp; high estate, and so departed out of <HI>Constantinople</HI> with one alone squier, &amp; when he came vnto the bridge, the like happened vnto him by <HI>Rodaran,</HI> as happened vnto <HI>Rodamarte,</HI> and was put prisoner with him in the same dungion, whereas they receyued so great sorrow and griefe to b&eacute;e in such a demaund ouercome, that rather they desired to dye then to liue.

And was very sorrowfull because that this victory did not passe in the great citie of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> thinking that ther, better then in any other place, he might reioyce himselfe of his great pride &amp; vain glory, &amp; did very much reprehend the queene for that ther was so much time lost in <HI>Carmania,</HI> in making that yron net for that they had no n&eacute;ede therof. The Qu&eacute;ene s&eacute;eing that he had great reason so to say, helde hir peace, &amp; answered nothing ther vnto. When the prince <HI>Roda|feo</HI> was ouercome &amp; prisoner, his squier returned backe a|gaine vnto <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and watching the time that the Emperour &amp; all his <HI>Knights</HI> were together, he entered into the court, &amp; declared all that which happened vnto the prince, at the which they were greatly amazed, &amp; from that day for|wards they had the valiant <HI>Rodaran</HI> in much more estima|tion, s&eacute;eing that he had ouercome two of the best <HI>knights</HI> that the Emperour had, &amp; although at that present the emperour receiued for them great sorow &amp; griefe, suspecting that these two princes should be ill intreated in the power of <HI>Roda|ran,</HI> yet because he was fully certified that ther remained be|hinde such <HI>knights</HI> for to combat with him, that very shortly would not ouely set them at liberty, but also bring <HI>Rodaran</HI> prisoner vnto him. So for that the third lot did fall vnto the mighty &amp; valiant prince <HI>Brandizel,</HI> to take this enterprise &amp; demaund, straight way as soone as the squier of <HI>Rodafeo</HI> had told the newes of his Lords imprisonment, he arose vp from the place wheras he was set nigh vnto the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> and put himselfe before the Emperour, &amp; asked lisence for to goe and combat with <HI>Rodaran,</HI> who did graunt it vnto him, and said.</P>
<P>I am very sorrowfull (mightye and valiaunt Prince) that you were not the first that went in this demaund, for if you had, I doe bel&eacute;eue of a certaintie, that <HI>Rodaran</HI> should not haue had any occasion to boast himselfe of the victorye of any <HI>knights</HI> of my Court.

they first b&eacute;egan their battaile, at which time <HI>Rodaran</HI> s&eacute;e|ing, that although h&eacute;e dyd his best in executing his furie, that there was no vauntage to b&eacute;e s&eacute;ene of neither of theyr parts, h&eacute;e was verie much amazed at the great force and strength of his aduersarie, and b&eacute;egan somwhat to acknow|ledge the great reason that the olde King of <HI>Gedrosia</HI> had, in praysing and extolling the high and mightie d&eacute;edes of the <HI>Knights of Greece:</HI> moreouer, h&eacute;e sayde vnto himselfe, that that <HI>knight</HI> alone was sufficient for to destroy halfe the armie of the Emperour <HI>Alycandro,</HI> and by reason that his pride was very great, and h&eacute;e himselfe of a valyaunt and stout courage, although the victorie should b&eacute;e very late, yet hee supposed that the fury of the Prince <HI>Brandizel</HI> could not endure long against him, and b&eacute;eing fullie perswaded in his thought, he made so great hast in striking of the Prince, that h&eacute;e made him very much to meruaile at his stout and valyant courage, b&eacute;ecause it troubled him very much, and brought him into that perplexitie, that h&eacute;e was driuen to b&eacute;esturre himselfe from the one side of the Bridge vnto the other, for to cleere himselfe from some of his great blowes, which to the contrarie h&eacute;e should haue receiued, and made him to vse more lightnesse then the bigge proportion of his body could well indure, and for that their sheelds were all cut and broken in p&eacute;eces, in such sort that there was no de|fence in them, the whole state of the battaile was in the great and mightie force in striking on another, executting their blowes with theyr swoords in both theyr hands, in such furious sort, that the one had great feare of the other, their bones and flesh were all brused with the mightie force of their blowes, and their bodies so wearied, that if it were not for the great valour of theyr hearts and courage, and againe the losse of victorie so shamefull and reprobrious, ther was neither of them, but with a very good will would haue throwen himselfe along vppon the ground to haue taken some rest, but by reason that they were so valyaunt <HI>Knights,</HI> and very few in all the whole world that were
<PB N="150" REF="158">
able to haue any vauntage of them, would not shew one a nother the great necessitie in the which they wer brought, <HI>Rodaran</HI> for that h&eacute;e was in the presence of the qu&eacute;ene, who was very sad and heauie in hir semblance, and no lesse mer|uailed to s&eacute;e the cruell battayle that was b&eacute;etw&eacute;ene them. Likewise the Prince <HI>Brandizel,</HI> with the remembraunce of the faire princesse <HI>Clarinea,</HI> and of the Emperour <HI>Trebatio,</HI> and all the rest of the knights of his court, he thought it bet|ter to die ther a thousand deaths, then to returne back vn|to the court, and loose the victory, at which thoughts they re|couered so great courage, &amp; gathered so great strength from theyr valiant harts, that eyther of them looked as well for death as victorie. At which time there had passed more then thr&eacute;e houres from the b&eacute;eginning of their battell all which time they neuer rested themselues, nor ceased not to oppresse the one the other all that in them was possible. Which was the occasion that the mightie and couragious stomacke of that valiaunt <HI>Rodaran</HI> was not sufficient, neyther the pre|sence of the qu&eacute;ene of <HI>Carmania,</HI> but that his great pride did abate (which b&eacute;efore was neuer brought in subiection) and of pure necessitie and force, by reason of his great weari|nesse, withdrew himselfe on the one side, and with the great griefe thereof h&eacute;e b&eacute;egan to speake vnto the prince and said. <HI>Knight</HI> hold thy hands, and let vs rest our selues a while, for that there doth continue time inough to finish our battell.</P>
<P>Likewise the Prince <HI>Brandizel</HI> at that time was brought into so great necessitie of rest, that without answering him any word, h&eacute;e did likewise withdraw himselfe, &amp; leaned vpon the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">mell of his sword for to take some ease, and immagi|ned vpon the great strength and courage of <HI>Rodaran.</HI> And it s&eacute;emed vnto him that in all his life time h&eacute;e neuer com|batted with any <HI>knight</HI> or giant that euer dyd charge him with so great and terrible blows, neither that euer did en|dure so long battayle with him without taking some rest, but onely that most worthie and valyaunt <HI>Knight of the Sunne.</HI> And h&eacute;e thought verily within himselfe, that if the
<PB REF="159">
force of <HI>Rodaran</HI> did long endure, it could not b&eacute;e otherwise but that he should b&eacute;e ouercome and loose the victory, and yet considering what a great shamd and rebuke it would b&eacute;e vnto him to come b&eacute;efore the Emperour <HI>Trebatio,</HI> and the rest of his great friends, the <HI>Knight of the Sunne</HI> and the Prince <HI>Clauerindo,</HI> h&eacute;e did fully determine with himselfe to loose his life fiting on foote, and not to b&eacute;e ouerthrowen from his Horse to the ground, and to loose the victorie. At this present time likewise <HI>Rodaran</HI> was leaning vppon his swoord to breath himselfe, and called vnto his remembrance the words that the olde king of <HI>Gedrosia</HI> had sayde vnto him, and s&eacute;emed that they would proue to bee true, and did verie much commend his great wisdome and knowledge, and dyd reprehend his owne gpeat pride, and would with a very good will haue giuen the greatest part of his estate, vpon co~dition that he had not put himselfe in this demaund, and contention, b&eacute;ecause h&eacute;e found himselfe to b&eacute;e so wearie, and that in so long time they had battaile and combat toge|ther, there was no vantage to b&eacute;e iudged on either part, h&eacute;e thought of a certaintie that it could not b&eacute;e otherwise, ibut h&eacute;e must b&eacute;e ouercome and loose the victory. And as h&eacute;e was b&eacute;eholding of the Prince, and very much meruailing at his great force and bountie, it s&eacute;emed vnto him that according vnto the mightinesse of his person and the richnesse of his armour, that h&eacute;e should b&eacute;e some <HI>Knight</HI> of high estate. So after a while that h&eacute;e had well breathed and refreshed him|selfe h&eacute;e saide.</P>
<P>Wherefore haue not w&eacute;e great care ouer our selues, and wish that w&eacute;e had not knowen one another, for that accor|ding vnto that which hath passed b&eacute;etwixt vs in this first battell, and againe, that which w&eacute;e doo looke for in the second battell, cannot b&eacute;e, but that eyther of vs will sooner consent to die, then to b&eacute;e ouer come and loose the victory. Therefore I doo desire th&eacute;e by the vertue of that thing that in all the world thou doost best loue, that thou doost tell m&eacute;e who thou art, for that according vnto thy mightie stature and great bountie, I cannot b&eacute;el&eacute;eue that thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ee a <HI>Knight</HI>

<P>H&eacute;ere the Prince <HI>Brandizel</HI> could not by any meanes let, but certifie him of his demaund, hauing coniured him in that sort, and therefore sayde.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Rodaran,</HI> b&eacute;ecause thou hast so great desire to know who I am, I will giue th&eacute;e to vnderstand, although it dooth grieue m&eacute;e very much to tell th&eacute;e. Thou shalt vnderstand that I am <HI>Brandizel,</HI> prince and right heire vnto the whole, Countrie of <HI>Persia,</HI> and sonne vnto the king <HI>Florion,</HI> and of the Qu&eacute;ene <HI>Balisea.</HI> Great thanckes doe I giue vnto the high and immortall Gods, for that I was fully certified within my selfe, that so valyant a <HI>knight</HI> as thou art could not b&eacute;e borne in this Countrie, therefore h&eacute;ere once againe I doo desire th&eacute;e that thou wilt tell m&eacute;e the occasion that so mightie a Prince as thou art, and beeing a Pagan, that thou dooest abide and recreate thy selfe in straunge Coun|tries, and to shew thy selfe so great a friend vnto Christi|ans: Tell m&eacute;e I pray th&eacute;e, if thou hast receiued their lawes, and customes, and left the law of the Pagans? Thou doost demaund of m&eacute;e great account, sayd the Prince, but for that thou shalt not b&eacute;el&eacute;eue all that which thou hast saide, I will bee briefe &amp; giue th&eacute;e to vnderstand in few words. I doo b&eacute;e|l&eacute;eue that thou doost know, or at the least wayes hast heard, of the great battailes and contentions that passed be|twixt my Father the King <HI>Florion,</HI> and the mightie <HI>Africa|no,</HI> who had vsurped and taken away my Fathers king|dome. I haue heard the same (said <HI>Rodaran</HI>) and I was cal|led vnto the sayd warres, and for that I did s&eacute;e that <HI>Afri|cano</HI> had neither reason nor iustice, I dyd refuse the iour|ney, and would not goe with him. Then the Prince sayde, you shall vnderstand that in these warres my Father got the victorie, and recouered all his lands the which h&eacute;e had lost, but especially by the great force, strength, and bountie of the valyaunt <HI>Knight of the Sunne,</HI> and Sonne vnto the Emperour <HI>Trebatio,</HI> who at this present remayneth in his Court, and by the prowesse of the Prince <HI>Clauerindo,</HI> sonne vnto the king <HI>Oristeo of Fraunce,</HI> both the which b&eacute;eing ve|rie
<PB REF="160">
young were lost, and both found at the Sea by the king my father, who carried them with him, whereas they two and I were brought vp all thr&eacute;e together, and from that time there dyd grow so great loue and friendship b&eacute;etwixt vs, which was the occasion, ioyntly with the dutie which I owe vnto them, that I am come in theyr company into this Countrie, &amp; cannot certifie my selfe, neither am I at quyet but when I am with them, and in their companie and con|uersation. This is the occasion wherefore I am come into this countrie, b&eacute;ecause you are so desirous to know, &amp; h&eacute;ere I meane to remaine so long as these princes abide in y^e Em|perours Court. Oh Prince <HI>Brandizel,</HI> saide <HI>Rodaran,</HI> now I plainely s&eacute;e and perceiue how that the high Gods are ve|ry angrie with the Pagan people, and will plague and pu|nish vs by the hands and power of the Christians, for that w&eacute;e haue now at this present, more then at any time h&eacute;ere|tofore so great confidence in them. Oh Prince of <HI>Persia,</HI> if the losse and destruction of thy naturall Countrie doo cause in th&eacute;e any sorrow, or the destruction of the Pagan people doo cause any griefe, then would thy hart lament, and cause th&eacute;e to leaue off this great friendship which thou hast with the Christians, and take vpon th&eacute;e mortall warre against them, for h&eacute;ere I doo giue th&eacute;e to vnderstand b&eacute;efore the great <HI>Cane,</HI> king of the <HI>Cambalos,</HI> and Emperour of <HI>Tar|taria,</HI> and b&eacute;efore all Kings and Lords, his subiects and vas|sals, the King <HI>Gedrosia,</HI> who is one of the wisest in deuina|tion and Astrologie, that is to b&eacute;e found in all the world, to whom at that present I gaue but small credit, hee dyd de|clare and pronounce that in our dayes and times should be stayne and destroyed the most part of all the Pagan peo|ple in the fields of <HI>Greece,</HI> by the mightie force and power of the <HI>Knights</HI> that b&eacute;e therein, and that there the greatest and mightiest Kings in all <HI>Asia</HI> shall loose theyr gouernment &amp; estates. Unto whose words I made no contradiction, for that it s&eacute;emed vnto m&eacute;e to b&eacute;e a thing impossible. And moreouer h&eacute;e said, that in the Empire of <HI>Greece</HI> there were such <HI>Knights,</HI> that if meanes were not found by one way
<PB N="152" REF="160">
or other to disturbe them, that they alone were sufficient to accomplish and bring to passe all this which I haue sayd. And for this occasion I departed out of my Kingdome and Countrie, and dyd promise the Emperour <HI>Alycandro</HI> ne|uer to retourne againe vnto the same, till such time as I came vnto the Empire of <HI>Greece,</HI> and there with my pow|er and force to take prisoners the best <HI>Knights</HI> that b&eacute;e in all the Empire, and to carrie them away with m&eacute;e vnto the Emperour <HI>Alycandro,</HI> &amp; now s&eacute;eing that you doo know my determination and purpose, and the great profit that will grow thereof vnto all <HI>Asia,</HI> I doo desire thee by the seruice and dutie which thou dost owe vnto the high Gods, that leauing the great friendship which thou hast with the Christians, let vs two procure to take and carrie them pri|soners into our Countrie, that by them w&eacute;e may raunsome and set our selues at libertie from the great destruction which is prognosticated to b&eacute;e done vnto vs by them, which by no meanes can b&eacute;e excused, except first w&eacute;e doo this which I haue tolde th&eacute;e. Then the Prince <HI>Brandizel</HI> answered and saide. Let the Pagans remaine in their Countrie, and let the Christians alone in theyrs, for that this remedie which thou hast taken in hand <HI>Rodaran,</HI> will verie little profit to excuse the harme which thou hast spoken of, b&eacute;e|ing a thing determined by the high powers. And h&eacute;ere I dooe giue th&eacute;e to vnderstand that there doth remaine many <HI>Knights</HI> in the Citie of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and such, as ten such <HI>knights</HI> as thou art be not sufficient to take one of them, and to bring him vnto prison. And h&eacute;ere I doo ad|vise th&eacute;e to take good h&eacute;ede and b&eacute;eware of the furie of the <HI>Knight of the Sunne,</HI> b&eacute;efore whom there is no humane <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">reature able to make any resistance. And in that thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">oost request m&eacute;e to leaue of theyr friendship, and to b&eacute;e|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ome theyr enimie, speake no more thereof vnto m&eacute;e, for I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">oo more est&eacute;eme their friendship and loue, and to b&eacute;e friend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">nto the sonnes of the Emperour <HI>Trebatio,</HI> and his friends, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">hen to b&eacute;e a Prince, yea more then to b&eacute;e Lord ouer all <HI>A|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ia.</HI> And if thou wilt leaue off this demaund which thou
<PB REF="161">
bringest with th&eacute;e, and goe vnto the Court of the Empe|rour <HI>Trebatio,</HI> and become a brother in our friendship, there shall b&eacute;e done vnto thee the honour that to such a <HI>knight</HI> be|longeth, and if not, let vs returne againe vnto our battell, and h&eacute;e which of vs two shall b&eacute;e ouercome, let him doo all that the other who winneth the victorie shall commaund, and so shall b&eacute;e excused all the requestes that are b&eacute;etwixt vs two.</Q></P>
<P>H&eacute;ere <HI>Rodaran</HI> was very sorrowfull, b&eacute;ecause h&eacute;e found so small comfort of the Prince in this his determination, and bel&eacute;euing that onely in the ouercomming of that knight dyd consist the accomplishing of his aduenture, and that it might so fall out, by the victorie of him to end his demaund, for that which the Prince had tould h&eacute;e could not b&eacute;eleeue, neyther giue credite that those <HI>knights</HI> which dyd remayne b&eacute;ehinde in the court, should b&eacute;e such as h&eacute;e dyd report them to b&eacute;e, but with the great anger which his words did cause in him, with a couragious stomacke h&eacute;e tooke his swoord in both his hands, and went against the Prince, and stroke him such a right downe blow vppon his fine and precyou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> healme, that with the noyse and force thereof it thundered in his eares, and so dazeled his eyes, that h&eacute;e was constray|ned to fall with his hands vpon the ground, not in such sort that h&eacute;e lost his remembrance, neither did his couragious hart fayle him, but was set in such a heate, with the anger of that mightie blow, that with great lightnesse h&eacute;e arose vp againe, and with his sword in both his hands h&eacute;e stroke so terrible a blow, being ouerthwart vpon the strong helme of <HI>Rodaran,</HI> that h&eacute;e made him to fall on the other side with the force of all his body vppon the wall of the Bridge, the which did sustaine him, that h&eacute;e fell not to the ground, ney|ther into the riuer, although whereas h&eacute;e receiued the blow with the sworde, it dyd grieue him in such sort, that h&eacute;e thought verily the eare and the iaw on that side had b&eacute;ene broken all to p&eacute;eces. Lykewise the blow which h&eacute;e recey|ued vppon the wall dyd grieue him very much, that if it had not b&eacute;ene by the great fury that h&eacute;e receiued, which dyd
<PB N="153" REF="161">
sustaine him, he could not haue kept him vpright on his f&eacute;et, but his anger &amp; fury was such, that as one that had not re|ceiued any hurt nor harme, with great lightnesse returned vpon the prince, &amp; began to strike at him such terrible &amp; thick blowes, as though the battaile wer but then new begun. At the which the prince was very much amazed, &amp; did force him selfe all that euer he could, to strike at <HI>Rodaran,</HI> the migh|tiest blowes that it was possible for him to giue, in such sort that the battaile was at that time in the greatest fury that euer it was. And the noise of their terrible &amp; thicke blowes vpon their fine helmes, was so great, that the towers &amp; gates of the bridge did s&eacute;eme to tremble. Then the squier of the prince who was without, was very much amazed that the battayle did so long endure, fearing that <HI>Rodaran</HI> dyd not make the battaile with the prince alone, for that it did so long indure, which caused him to goe from one place vnto an other, procuring wher he might be to s&eacute;e what passed betwixt them, to certifie the truth therof. And as he went alongst the waters side, he went so far that he might discouer the space of the bridge that was betwixt the two towers, &amp; although the walls or battilments of the bridge were somwhat high, yet for that the <HI>knights</HI> were both very bigge of theyr per|sons, that h&eacute;e might from their brestes vpwardes discerne them, so that part of their battaile h&eacute;e might perceiue. And when this squier did s&eacute;e that they were alone, and the great heate and fury of their battaile, which seemed at that time to be but new begun, h&eacute;e was greatly aston<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ed and as one halfe amazed, and could not perswade with himselfe, that in two <HI>knightes</HI> could b&eacute;e comprehended so great force and strength. So these two <HI>knightes</HI> continued in the second battaile more then one hower, and no vauntage could b&eacute;e knowne b&eacute;etw&eacute;ene them, although both of them, had done to the vttermost that was in their power, force &amp; strength. And for that they were both of them of very bigge bodies, and the trauaile great which they had passed, and the ter|rible and mighty blowes by the one and the other receued,
<PB REF="162">
did so much torment them, that they were brought vnto the estate, that their strengthes did faile them, in such sort that eyther of them was at that estate, and thought verely to be ouercome.</P>
<P>So when that <HI>Rodaran,</HI> saw that his contention did little profit him, &amp; could not help himselfe in the battaile, he then called to remembrance, that which the qu&eacute;ene <HI>Carmania,</HI> had aduised him off, &amp; was, that in that place wheras she was, he should finde ease, at such time as hee found himselfe in the greatest necessitie in the battaile, which caused him little &amp; litle to retire backwards towardes the place whereas shee was, giuing &amp; receiuing blowes, as the time did serue.</P>
<P>The Prince <HI>Brandizel,</HI> likewise at that time was in that perplexitie that he was ready to yeelde himselfe for to be o|uercome, but when he saw that <HI>Rodaran,</HI> did begin to retire, with the great ioy &amp; pleasure which h&eacute;e receiued to see him so vpon a sodaine to fainte, that he began a new to recouer his force &amp; strength, &amp; followed him, striking at him with all the might he could, but his faintnesse and warinesse was so great, that he could scarce life one leg after an other&punc; for to follow him: the which when <HI>Rodaran</HI> did perceiue, he would with a very good will haue returned to haue made resistance for that it seemed vnto him that in a small time h&eacute;e should ouercome him, for that the prince was so weary and f&eacute;eble, But when he would haue forced himselfe thervnto, h&eacute;e fea|red that he was wholy depriued of his strength, &amp; his armes so sore with wearinesse, that he was constrained still to re|tire backwardes, till such time as he himselfe &amp; the prince, were wholy vnder the uaut or arch of the second tower of the bridge, wheras the queene <HI>Carmania,</HI> nigh vnto the same, sate in hir estate. Who when she saw that these two knights were so weary that almost they could not stand vpon theyr feete.</P>
<P>She pulled a corde of Silke which hanged by hir, &amp; came downe from the height of the arch, which caused that arti|ficiall
<PB N="154" REF="162">
net of yron to fall down vpon both those <HI>knights,</HI> in such sort, that their heades were fast in the net, &amp; their legs and armes so fast bound with all their body, and with so great strength, that they were not able to turne them selues on the one side nor on the other, but were taken prisoners in such sort, that if they were not made loose by other, it were a thing impossible to be loosed.</P>
<P>So when this was done, the qu&eacute;ene arose vp from the place wheras she sat, &amp; commanded a great chaine to be brought, &amp; the helme of the prince to be taken off, &amp; the chaine to be put about his neck, likewise they made his hands fast with ma|nakils, that he was not able to moue nor to doe any thing.</P>
<P>Then she commanded a gentlewoman that a key should be brought, wherewith she did open a lock that the not was made fast with all, &amp; cleered out of the net, both the prince &amp; <HI>Rodaran.</HI> They being out, the cord was pulled, &amp; the net car|ried vp againe into the place whereas it was before. But when this valiant prince <HI>Brandizel,</HI> saw himselfe betraied &amp; prisoner, he thought verily to haue burst with anger: &amp; with great yre &amp; wrath he said vnto <HI>Rodaran.</HI> <Q>Oh false &amp; traite|rous <HI>knight,</HI> what reason hath moued th&eacute;e being a <HI>knight</HI> of so great power &amp; strength in armes, &amp; of so high estate, for to commit so great treason, against one alone knight, ma|king battaile against th&eacute;e, his body against thine.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Tell mee traitour, how canst thou consent to be called <HI>knight,</HI> when thou dost vse so great villanie vnto the noble order of <HI>Knighthood.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>How canst thou praise and extoll thy selfe, in the great <HI>Asia,</HI> to haue ouercome and gotten the victory ouer <HI>knights of Grecia,</HI> when that with so great falsehood &amp; treason thou hast apprehended them.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Rodaran,</HI> was verye much amazed at this which the Qu&eacute;ene had done, and at the great subtilnesse of the arte where with sh&eacute;e did assure him of this victory against those Grecian <HI>Knightes,</HI> And for that b&eacute;efore this time, he dyd not
<PB REF="163">
know the secret of hir polesie, &amp; making himselfe very igno|rant therof, he answered &amp; said. Thou hast no reason, prince of <HI>Persia,</HI> to call me traitour, for that in all my life time I haue not committed any treason. And h&eacute;ere I doe sweare vnto th&eacute;e by the high god<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">, that I was as ignorant of this which the qu&eacute;ene hath done, as thy selfe. And retiring back|wards towards hir, was, for that I being weary in the bat|taile &amp; very faint, I thought by the sight of hir to recoyer some force and strength, for that the loue which I doe bear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> vnto hir, is very much. Well said the Prince, s&eacute;eing it is so that thou art without fault, do so much that my helme may be brought vnto me again, &amp; that this chaine may be taken a|way, &amp; let vs returne againe vnto our battaile. I will not consent ther vnto said the qu&eacute;ene, for that thou art my pri|soner. And <HI>Rodaran,</HI> shall not giue vnto this liberty. Then lady said the prince, giue it you vnto me, for no longer time, then to make an end of our battaile: &amp; that being finished, I doe promise you by the faith of a <HI>knight,</HI> to returne againe vnto your person. For vnto such a lady as you are, what so euer <HI>knight</HI> he be, wil thinke well to be your prisoner.</P>
<P>Truely I doe like as ill of this as of the other, sayde the Qu&eacute;ene of <HI>Carmania,</HI> for that at such time as the battayle shalbe finished betw&eacute;ene th&eacute;e &amp; <HI>Rodaran,</HI> thou shalt remaine in such pitifull case, that I shall receiue no profit of thy im|prisonment. Therfore goe your wayes at this time &amp; beare company with the other <HI>Knights</HI> of the emperour <HI>Trebatio,</HI> and giue them some comfort, for that they are very sad and sorrowfull, to finde themselues prisoners: and very shortlie we will send others for to comfort th&eacute;e also. And take this of a certainty, that we will not carry you from hence till such time as we haue all the best <HI>Knights</HI> that the Empe|rour <HI>Trebatio</HI> hath&punc; h&eacute;ere prisoners, to beare you company.</P>
<P>And forth with they carried the prince away from thence who was so angry and furious, that it s&eacute;emed that he felt no

With this thought (which grieued them not a li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">le) these thr&eacute;e good <HI>knights</HI> did passe away the time, tarry|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> to s&eacute;e what fortune would dispose of them.

<P>Ualyant King, I pray God grant vnto you the victory a|gaynst that strong &amp; stout pagan, &amp; deliuer th&eacute;e from trea|son, for I doe bel&eacute;eue that y^e imprisonme~t of such <HI>knights</HI> can not b&eacute;e without some treason or falsehoode.

<PB N="156" REF="164">
that if ther were not some treason vsed with <HI>Rodaran,</HI> that the prince <HI>Brandizel</HI> would rather consent to die then to bee ouercome.

In all this life, although the imprisonment of the thr&eacute;e princes were some griefe vnto them, yet for all that they ceased not con|tinually to make great feasts &amp; sports throughout all the great citie, &amp; in the Emperours pallaice, wheras euery day the princesse <HI>Claridiana</HI> came &amp; many other ladies &amp; gentle|women, they had great plesure &amp; delight in making amongst themselues so great feasts &amp; sports, that they passed away all the time in great pleasure &amp; pastimes, although the iealous thoughts of the princes <HI>Lindabrides</HI> wold not by any meanes suffer hir to reioyce hir selfe in any kind of pastime, but it was the occasion that she receiued the greater griefe, b&eacute;e|cause the princes <HI>Claridiana</HI> at all times was in presence, &amp; hir great beautie &amp; gentill grace would not suffer hir to as|sure hir selfe of the great loue sh&eacute;e had vnto the <HI>knight of the Sun,</HI> who alwaies when he was in presence of these two ladies, was so troubled, that all that were ther present dyd greatlye meruaile that h&eacute;e was so quiet and hadde so few wordes, and the other for that he was no more wearyer, of the which the princesse <HI>Claridiana</HI> did not let but had some suspition of that which hir great beautie and desert dyd as|sure hir. And b&eacute;ecause the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> didde not behold hir, and cast his eye vppon hir, so often as sh&eacute;e desi|red, she was in a great confusion and troubled within hir selfe, not knowing whether h&eacute;e did it or no, for that h&eacute;e would not haue that those which were ther present should haue any suspition of the loue that h&eacute;e bare vnto hir,

<HEAD>&para; How the king Sacridoro went to combat with Rodaran, &amp; of all that happened vnto them therein. Chapter. 41.</HEAD>
<P>_THe valiaunt King <HI>Sacridoro</HI> after that h&eacute;e was departed out of the great hall, went straight vnto his lodging, wheras hee was armed with his strong and rich armour, &amp; mounting vpon a mighty great and light horse, accompanied with one alone page, for to cary his speare, he departed out of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> &amp; with the great desire he had to proue himselfe with <HI>Rodaran,</HI> in a short time he came vnto the bridge, &amp; as soone as <HI>Rodaran</HI> had discouered him from the top of one of the towers, he straight way armed himselfe with his strong &amp; rich armour &amp; being mounted vpon his horse, he commanded that the gates of the first tower should be opened, wherat the king <HI>Sacridoro</HI> en|tred, with his speare in his hand, &amp; straight waies the gates were shut againe, leauing his page without, who did as the squier of <HI>Brandizel</HI> did, procure wher he might see &amp; beholde the battaile. The king <HI>Sacridoro</HI> as soone as he was within, found <HI>Rodaran</HI> mounted vpon his horse, and very well ar|med, with his speare in his hand, whom h&eacute;e did salute ve|rye curteouslie. To whom <HI>Rndaran</HI> said, <HI>knight,</HI> thou art welcome, for that according vnto the semblance and good proportion, thou shouldest be one of the best esteemed <HI>knights</HI> that the emperour <HI>Trebatio</HI> hath in all his Court. There|fore I pray th&eacute;e tell mee who thou art, that I may vnder|stand with whom I shall make battayle, and I am sure if the emperour doe send th&eacute;e, it is to amend the faults of the
<PB N="157" REF="165">
Prince of <HI>Persia,</HI> and it should appeare that thou art in great estimation, for to come and reuenge the Prince, who was so valyaunt, that I neuer in all my lyfe had so much trauayle to ouercome one <HI>knight.</HI> To whom the King aun|swered and sayde. Thou shalt vnderstand <HI>Rodaran</HI> that I am called <HI>Sacridoro,</HI> and am king of <HI>Antiochia,</HI> and <HI>Knight</HI> vnto the Emperour <HI>Trebatio,</HI> and a perfect friend vnto <HI>Ro|sicleer,</HI> his sonne, who otherwise is called the <HI>knight of Cu|pid,</HI> of whose valiaunt and mightie d&eacute;edes I am sure thou hast heard tell. Of a truth I haue heard great talke of him (sayd <HI>Rodaran</HI>) for that in all <HI>Asia</HI> ther is not a thing more noysed and published abroade, then the great aduenture which h&eacute;e finished in the caue of <HI>Phenicia.</HI> And one of the chiefest occasions which hath brought me into this country is, for to proue my selfe with him, for that I cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> of truth, that hee should bee so valiant as the fame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> of him in all y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> countrie. To whom the king answered, of my faith I doo promise th&eacute;e, that if once thou doost prooue him, h&eacute;e will bring th&eacute;e out of this doubt, for all that thou hast heard speak in him, is nothing, in comparison of that which thou shalt finde of him, if thou doost once prooue him. Truth it is thou hast ouercome &amp; got the victorie of such <HI>knights,</HI> that there bee few in the world like vnto them, and although I doo come hether to combat with th&eacute;e, I doo come more for to put my selfe out of doubt, of a mistrust that I haue, for that I cannot beel&eacute;eue that thou couldest get the victory of them without some falsehood or deceite, and for to thinck that I can doo more against thee then they were able, for in all things, they were able to amend my faults. Thou shalt straight wayes s&eacute;e, sayde <HI>Rodaran,</HI> whether that my power and force b&eacute;e able to dooe more then this or no. And ther with he turned about his horse, and tooke so much scope as was sufficient for his Horse. The King did the like, so both of them with their Speares in their hands, broched their furious Horsses, who made their course with so great swiftnesse, that quickly they were together, whereas they did execute the force and strength of their furious encoun|ter,
<PB REF="166">
and shieuered their Speares all to p&eacute;eces vppon theyr fine armour, after that they had glanced from their sh&eacute;elds, and with the force of their furious encounter, their horses ioyned together with their mightie bodies, that horse and man fell vpon the ground, and b&eacute;eing fast in their saddles, the euill fortune of the king <HI>Sacridoro</HI> was such, that one of his logges doubled vnder his Horse, in such sort, that by no meanes h&eacute;e could pull it out, nor cl&eacute;ere himselfe to arise againe, and <HI>Rodaran</HI> with the force of the mightie fall, was so astonyed and amazed, that voyde of remembraunce h&eacute;e lay along vpon the ground without moouing hand or foote, but as one that were dead. The occasion thereof was, for that h&eacute;e was so big membred and footed withall, that the rigorous fall was more perillous vnto him then vnto the king <HI>Sacridoro.</HI> But when the Qu&eacute;ene <HI>Carmania</HI> saw all that had passed, sh&eacute;e arose vp from the place wheras sh&eacute;e sat in companie with all hir Ladies, and came whereas these two <HI>Knights</HI> were on the ground, and tooke of <HI>Rodarans</HI> healme and gaue him aire, so that hee came againe to him|selfe presently, and arose vp on his f&eacute;ete, and was greatlie amazed at the great strength of the king <HI>Sacridoro,</HI> &amp; went towards him, who with very anger was readie to burst, to s&eacute;e himselfe in that great extremitie, and could not help himselfe. <HI>Rodaran</HI> pulled of his healme from his head, and tooke his swoord from him, and made fast a mightie great chaine vnto his legge, and put a payre of manacles vpon his hands, and so carried him prisoner whereas the other Princes were, with so great sorrow and griefe for that which had happened, that if it had not b&eacute;ene for the losse of his soule, h&eacute;e would haue slaine himselfe. And when the other Princes did know the valyaunt king <HI>Sacridoro,</HI> their sorow and paine dyd double increase. And when eyther of them had tolde him all that they had passed with <HI>Rodaran,</HI> h&eacute;e and all the rest were very sad and heauie, for that they did b&eacute;el&eacute;eue of certaintie, if God did not put remedie there|in, it were not possible that there should remaine any good <HI>knight,</HI> but bee brought all to prison. So there they remay|ned

all foure together very sorrowfull, til their fortune did procure to the contrarie, but their sorrow and griefe was not so much to s&eacute;e themselues so in prison, as <HI>Rodaran</HI> recei|ued ioy and pleasure, for the good fortune that h&eacute;e had with the King <HI>Sacridoro,</HI> for that according vnto y^e great encoun|ter that h&eacute;e receiued of him h&eacute;e should haue passed great ex|tremitie, if h&eacute;e had ioyned with him in battaile with theyr swoords, so that at this time h&eacute;e made little account of the rest of the <HI>knights</HI> which remained, because hee had brought into his power these other past, who were very valiant and of great prowesse. The Page of the King <HI>Sacridoro</HI> when h&eacute;e saw his Lord carried to prison and his healme from his head, after hee had made that great encounter, he would tar|rie no longer, but with great sorrow returned vnto <HI>Con|stantinople,</HI> whereas h&eacute;e gaue the Emperour to vnderstand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ud all the <HI>Knights</HI> that were there present, the heauie newes of all that had passed, which caused such an admira|tion in all them that heard it, that they knew not what to say, but that <HI>Rodaran</HI> was the most valiauntest and stron|gest knight that was in all the Pagan land. And the sor|row and griefe was so much that the Emperour receiued, that hee wold haue armed himselfe, and haue gone and proo|ued himselfe with <HI>Rodaran,</HI> but that his sonne <HI>Rosicleer,</HI> who receiued greatest griefe for the imprisonment of the king <HI>Sacridoro,</HI> and was the fifth to whom the lot dyd fall out to follow the demaund. Without any more tarrying h&eacute;e asked lisence of his Father, who committing him vnto God, dyd graunt it vnto him, saying.</P>
<P>My welbeeloued and good sonne, vse thy selfe in such sort that thou maist reuenge the iniurie done vnto thy friends. And in this thing I doo acknowledge the great benefit that God hath done vnto m&eacute;e, in that I doo know th&eacute;e and thy Brother to b&eacute;e my sonnes, which is the occasion that my court is so greatly honoured with so many valiant <HI>knights,</HI> and now in this time that <HI>Rodaran</HI> hath put vs into this great extremitie, which would haue fallen out very euill if w&eacute;e should haue lacked you.</P>
<P><PB REF="167">But whereas your highnesse is, said <HI>Rosicleer,</HI> we might b&eacute;e well forborne, for if it were so that w&eacute;e were all prisoners vnto <HI>Rodaran,</HI> w&eacute;e should receiue great comfort, and haue our libertie very certaine, if you alone did remaine.

In this sort did the Prince trauaile towards the Bridge of Iaspe,
<PB N="159" REF="167">
and b&eacute;eing sore troubled within his thoughts, oftentimes h&eacute;e had lost his way, if his page which went with him had not put him in remembrance, which was the occasion that h&eacute;e made the time long before h&eacute;e came vnto the bridge, and for that the remembraunce of <HI>Don Siluerio</HI> dyd cause vnto him great sorrow and griefe, that many times h&eacute;e sayd vn|to himselfe: Oh if God were so pleased, that in satisfaction of the great trauayle which the Princesse <HI>Oliuia</HI> hath cau|sed m&eacute;e to haue, that this <HI>knight</HI> were <HI>Don Siluerio,</HI> h&eacute;e that I doo now goe to seeke, and although the great fauour which h&eacute;e hath, is sufficient to defend him from all the world, yet the great reason which I haue to complaine my selfe, is suf|ficient that I dooe execute vpon him this my great anger &amp; wrath. And in this thing alone the Princesse <HI>Oliuia</HI> must pardon m&eacute;e, for although I would rather suffer death then in any thing to cause hir to receiue anger, yet cannot I let to dooe that and much more, to giue hir vnderstanding of the small reason that sh&eacute;e had to forget m&eacute;e and receiue another. And h&eacute;ere I doo protest that if death doth not cut m&eacute;e off first, I will reuenge this my bloody wrath, and then perhaps sh&eacute;e will w&eacute;epe and lament hir errour. And al|thought this is not sufficient to make satisfaction vnto this my vnhappie Fortune, neyther can it giue anie remidie or ease vnto this great griefe, the which I haue for hir cause receiued, yet it shall suffice me that another shall not boast himselfe, to haue obtained and got that which I haue lost, neither any other to reioice himselfe with that which doth cause my sorrow and griefe.

And hauing great confidence in his mighty strength and in the bignesse of his body, determined to assault his aduersarie by proofe thereof, and therewith h&eacute;e threw his Swoord from him, and caught <HI>Rosicleer</HI> in his armes, and trauailed with his stre~gth all that euer he could for to hoise him out of his saddle, or to ouerthrow him to the ground, but <HI>Rosicleer</HI> who was as strong as h&eacute;e, dyd not refuse the wrastling, but likewise threw his Swoord from him, and caught him b&eacute;etwixt his strong armes, and dyd so stronglie crush him, that <HI>Rosicleer</HI> dyd well perceiue that his deter|mination dyd not fall out as h&eacute;e thought. So in this sort for a good space they trauayled the one to ouerthrow the other, but there was no aduauntage perceiued b&eacute;etw&eacute;ene them, neyther could the one ouerthrow his aduersarie, till in the end after gret trauayle they both together dyd force themselues so much, clasping theyr kn&eacute;es hard vnto theyr saddle, hauing one another in their armes, they did so much, that both theyr Horsses foundered and fell with theyr ma|sters vnto the ground, and being downe, for to arise againe they were constrained to loose themselues. who with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> were vpon their f&eacute;ete, and returned to their battaile againe with their swoords, for they could little profit themselues with wrastling, in the which contention they endured more then two houres, without knowing any aduauntage in ey|ther of them, although in the ende it s&eacute;emed vnto <HI>Rodaran</HI>
<PB N="169" REF="169" MS="y">
that <HI>Rosicleer,</HI> did execute his fury with so great courage &amp; lightnesse, as when he first began the battaile, &amp; saw plainly that whatsoeuer he could do, he should get no victory of him, but saw the perill of his destruction to be very certaine, if he should long endure his strong &amp; terrible blowes, which was the occasion that he dissembled &amp; shewed himselfe to b&eacute;e much more weary then he was, &amp; began litle &amp; litle to reti|er backwards, towards the place wheras the qu&eacute;ene of <HI>Car|menia</HI> was: alwaies striking at <HI>Rosicleer,</HI> his blowes of more fury and force, who followed him, for that he should not gather any suspition of falsehood. So in this sort they did combat tog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ther very strongly, till such time as they were both vnder the arch or vaute, hard by whereas the Queene was: who s&eacute;eing <HI>Rodaran,</HI> so nigh the point to be ouercome, she pulled the cord, &amp; made the Iron net to fall downe vpon both the <HI>knights</HI> in such sort, that they were both prisoners, &amp; so fast baund, that they could not moue themselues to the one part nor to the other.

Who for that you are all enemies vnto our sect and lawes, he would gladly s&eacute;e you all slaine. Unto which words of <HI>Rodaran, Rosicleer</HI> would not answere any thing, but suf|fered them to cary him wheras the other <HI>knights</HI> were pri|soners: who hauing heard the great noise &amp; rumour of the battaile, they were meruailously astonied, fearing what it should be. But when they saw them bring thether <HI>Rosicleer</HI> with his helme taken of, &amp; a great chaine at his necke, theyr sorrow &amp; griese did increase, in such sort, that either of them would haue giuen the aduenture against ten such as <HI>Roda|ran,</HI> for to s&eacute;e themselues at liberty, onely for to giue him his payment for this his great treason.</P>
<P>But when <HI>Rosicleer,</HI> did s&eacute;e them, his sorrow &amp; paine was so great, that he could not speake, but they forceing them|selues all that euer they could, did comfort him, saying: That now was the time to put away sorrow &amp; griefe and to b&eacute;e thankfull vnto almighty god, for that s&eacute;eing that the <HI>knight of the Sun,</HI> was abrod, &amp; at liberty, that God would not con|sent that so great treason should goe forwards, but that by the force &amp; strength of his armes, h&eacute;e will put remedy, the better that we may vnderstand and know, that the great force and strength of men, neither the great and surpassing beautie &amp; valour of <HI>knights,</HI> is not sufficient, whereas doth lacke his diuine succour.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="170" MS="y">At this time the great ioy &amp; pleasure, which <HI>Rodaran</HI> recei|ued, was out of all measure, s&eacute;eing hee had got for prisoner that famous &amp; valiant <HI>Knight of Cupid.</HI> And that ther could remaine no other <HI>knight,</HI> that was able to make any resist|ance against his great force &amp; strength, but onely the <HI>knight of the Sun,</HI> of whom he had heard tell of his meruailous and strange d&eacute;eds of armes.

<P>So when that the page of <HI>Rosicleer,</HI> who was within per|ceiued that the battaile was ended, he knocked very strong|ly at the gate by the ring, till such time, as he was answe|red &amp; giuen to vnderstand, that his master was ouercome &amp; lost the victory, &amp; was prisoner: &amp; how that he should depart vnto the emperour <HI>Trebatio,</HI> &amp; tell him that h&eacute;e should send an other <HI>knight.</HI> The page when he heard these words, with great sorrow &amp; heauinesse, he departed from thence, &amp; sayde within himselfe: well, s&eacute;eing that <HI>Rodaran</HI> had ouercome the <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Cupid,</HI> so likewise he would ouercome &amp; haue the victory of all the rest that remained.

<P>But when the emperour &amp; all the rest of the <HI>knights</HI> heard those heauy newes, they were so greatly amazed, that they were almost out of their wittes, not knowing what to say, but looking the one vpon the other, and s&eacute;emed vnto them as though it had ben a dreame. But when these newes came to the hearing of the Empresse, hir sorrowfull greefe was so great, that as one dead, sh&eacute;e fell down into the lap of the princes <HI>Claridiana,</HI> who sat next vnto hir, &amp; procured with all hir force, to bring hir to hir selfe againe, and did comfort hir, saying, that she had no reason so much to set vnto hyr hart the imprisonment of <HI>Rosicleer,</HI> &amp; how that she was ful|ly perswaded, that it was a thing impossible, except it wer by treason, &amp; requested hir to pacifie hir selfe, for that there remained such <HI>knightes</HI> behind, who very quickly would dis|couer the secret therof, &amp; when that this will not serue, <HI>Ro|daran</HI> is still in your country out of the which you n&eacute;ed not let them to depart and carry away their prise.</P>
<P>At which time the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> without any more tarrying arose out of the place whereas h&eacute;e was with so great anger, that his faire and white coulour, was turned into sanguine and black.</P>
<P>And asking licence of the emperour, he departed out of the great hall, &amp; went vnto his lodging &amp; armed himselfe with his strong and bright armour, &amp; mounting vpon his strange &amp; light horse, he departed out of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> &amp; toke his way towards the bridge of the Iaspe, with as great desire to s&eacute;e himself with <HI>Rodaran,</HI> as to returne wheras he might comfort and reioyce himselfe with the sight of his Ladies: without whose sight, in such like passions, it s&eacute;emed that it was not possible that he could liue: who at this present this History doth leaue, for to tell you of other things that pas|sed in the meane time in England.</P>

<HEAD>&para; How the Prince Don Siluerio returned and demaunded of the king his daughter the Princesse Oliuia, to wife, and be|cause she would not marrye with him, shee returned with hir knights, and of all that chanced therin. Chap. 43.</HEAD>
<P>_YOu haue heard what great sorrow &amp; griefe the newes of the death of <HI>Rosicleer</HI> did cause in the Court of the King <HI>Oliuerio,</HI> &amp; likewise how ioyfull the prince <HI>Don Siluerio</HI> was, for that the king had giuen him his word &amp; pro|mise that the princesse <HI>Oliuia</HI> should marrye with him, but he did not so much desire it, as the princes did hate him. For although that the heauy newes of the death of <HI>Rosicleer</HI> did touch hir very neere, yet she repented hir selfe so much, for that crueltie which she had vsed vnto him, &amp; the great loue that the remembrance of him did cause in hir, that rather she would consent to death, then agree vnto that which the king hir father had requested of hir diuers and sundry times. And for that the prince <HI>Don Siluerio</HI> dyd many times importune the king to performe his promise, which was the thing he most desired. Who answered him, that till such time as he had ended the wars which h&eacute;e had with the emperour <HI>Trebatio,</HI> hee could not by any meanes conclude with the princes, which was the occasion that con|tinually he passed the time in grieuous passions, supposing that it was for no other thing, but a pollisie, to cause the prin|cesse to giue hir father such an answere as should be contra|ry to his will &amp; desire. And because the time to giue case and remedy vnto his desire was so long, and he not able to en|dure, (his sorrow and griefe was such) the delay there|of. Upon a day, at such time as he found the princesse <HI>Roda|silua</HI> all alone he did verye earnestly desire hir, that by all wayes and meanes possible she should learne to know of the Princesse <HI>Oliuia</HI> the truth of the aunswere which sh&eacute;e
<PB REF="172">
made vnto the king hir father at such time as he tolde hir that he would marry hir with him, whether, it was with good will and determined purpose to accomplish the same at the time appointed, or whether she did it to prolong the time, be|ing moued by some hatred towards him, for that according vnto hir answere, he would determine what were best for him to doe. Then the princesse <HI>Rodasilua</HI> who had great de|sire to vse remedy and to case the sorrowfull passions of hir brother, did promise him to doe all that euer in hir power was possible to be done, &amp; so tooke hir leaue &amp; departed from him, &amp; waited hir time. It chanced afterward vpon a day at such time as the princesse <HI>Oliuia</HI> was alone in hir closet, she went &amp; knocked at the doore, &amp; being knowen who she was, the doore was opened straight waies, &amp; she went in, &amp; found the princesse with hir countenance very heauy &amp; sorrowfull, and hir eyes swollen with continuall w&eacute;eping, &amp; hir faire ch&eacute;ekes which before were wont to be rudy &amp; full, was now so leane &amp; wan, as though she had ben new risin out of some great sicknesse or infirmity. And finding hir in this order, be|ing moued thereby vnto great compassion, she said: What is this my lady &amp; mistres, is it not sufficient, the time wher|in I serued you for maid of honor, &amp; the great good will that continully I had in any thing that did appertaine vnto your seruice, in the which I was alwaies faithfull &amp; true, &amp; do I not now deserue to know the occasion wherefore, and from whence doth proc&eacute;ede (that wheras at other times you were wont to be very merry &amp; ioyfull, &amp; giuen to pleasure &amp; pas|times, &amp; now vpon the sodaine to be so sorrowfull &amp; sad) for that I haue s&eacute;ene your great beauty &amp; fairenesse to snrmou~t all other damsels &amp; gentlewomen in the world, &amp; now I doe s&eacute;e all lost &amp; in a mortall hew. Tell me the occasion for gods sake wherfore it should grow, that I might do my good will and therin shew the great loue that I doe beare vnto you, in s&eacute;eking remedy for the same. And h&eacute;ere I do protest that if

you will not giue me to vnderstand the occasion h&eacute;ereof, that forth with I wil depart from hence vnto mine own country, for that I do not determine to serue any more those that so euill doe reward them that doe trauaile in their seruice.</P>
<P>At which words of the princesse <HI>Rodasilua,</HI> the princesse <HI>O|liuia</HI> receiued no ioy nor pleasure, but rather did the more in|crease hir paine &amp; griefe, for that she knew not what to an|swere vnto such an importunat demaund although after a while that she held hir peace, with great desire that she had to turne hir of, &amp; to send hir away, sh&eacute;e said.</P>
<P>Lady it is very doubtfull and hard to thinke that any per|son in the world can perseuer in their great pleasure &amp; con|tentment, &amp; neuer to receiue any sadnesse nor griefes in their liues, no, for sure it is a thing that onely is receiued for those happy creatures who doe reioyce themselues in the celesti|all glory, &amp; if at this present that I am so sad &amp; discontented as you do s&eacute;e me, it is not a thing to be meruailed at, for y^t it is no new thing to all vs that doe line in this world, euery day to receiue pleasure &amp; displeasure. And if in all this time I haue not told you the occasion wherfore I am sad, it hath not ben for lack of good will for to pleasure you, neither lack of knowledge of the good deeds which continually I haue re|ceiued by you, but onely the euill which I do f&eacute;ele in m&eacute;e is such, &amp; of such quality, that I my selfe doe not vnderstand it for to shew it vnto the phisition, whereby he might procure some Phisick for to remedy the same. But this onely I can say, that I do find my selfe very sad, for that ther is nothing that can giue me any contentment to reioyce &amp; recreat my selfe. Likewise I doe f&eacute;ele my selfe mortall, for that I doe hate and abhorre to liue, so that ther is no Phisicke to b&eacute;e ministred, wheras sicknesse is not knowen And this great heauinesse &amp; discontentment doth proceed from my hart, and there is none but the heart that can declare from whence the occasion doth proceede.</P>
<P><PB REF="173">This is all that I can aduertise you, my ladies &amp; princes, &amp; if this doe not giue you satisfaction, you must pardon me, for that I am not to giue you any farther intelligence. In this hath your highnes shewed me great fauor, said <HI>Rodasilua,</HI> in y^t you would vouchsafe to declare vnto me the qualitie of this your infirmitie, which is one of the strangest diseases that euer I heard of in all my life. And being such a sicknesse as you haue told me, it cannot be knowen, neyther is ther any phisicke to be ministred, I promise you I know not what to say therevnto, but onely this, &amp; in my iudgement it is best, that you take vnto your selfe a husband, hauing now so good opportunitie, in that the king your father doth offer vnto you such a mariage, as is conuenient for your honour &amp; es|tate. And although I am a damsell &amp; haue no experience of these matters, yet by my selfe I may iudge of another, &amp; doe suppose that ther is nothing vnder the <HI>Sun</HI> that is more pro|fitable to giue you pleasure, &amp; to cause you to haue content|ment, &amp; to put from you this heauinesse which you haue vp|on your stomacke: &amp; s&eacute;eing that it is a thing certaine that you must doe h&eacute;ereafter, as you haue promised &amp; giuen your word vnto the king <HI>Oliuerio,</HI> your father, in my opinion it were better out of hand to procure the same, &amp; not to pro|long the time, but take time whilest time doth serue, for that peraduenture the time will come that you would, &amp; then you cannot, for as you haue said, ther is no constancy in things of this world, &amp; euery day you haue a new chaunge, &amp; the con|ditions of men doe alter. At which words the princes&punc; <HI>Oliuia</HI> dyd well vnderstand, that the whole communication of the Princesse <HI>Rodasilua</HI> did extend in the fauour of <HI>Don Sil|uerio</HI> hir brother, for the which, b&eacute;eing angry, as shee, who did hate and ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">orre him more then any thing in all the world, pretending to put hir out of all doubt, and that she should not afterwardes come vnto hir any more with the like enterprise, sh&eacute;e aunswered hir agayne and sayde: Lady I doe giue you great thankes for this remedy which

you haue giuen m&eacute;e for my great sicknesse, and dooe accept very much your good will therein, but yet I should thincke much better of you (s&eacute;eing as you doo say that your whole desire is that I might haue remedie for the same (that such Phisicke as you doo wish vnto mee, might extend wholie to expulse this my great sorrow and griefe, and not vnder cou|lour of pretence to ease and help m&eacute;e, to procure to put re|medie in some other, fayning to applie it wholie vnto mee. Therefore Lady and Princesse <HI>Rodasylua,</HI> h&eacute;ere I doo giue you to vnderstand of a certaintie, that there is no remedy of Phisicke that can giue remedy and ease of this my great euill, no I say, not to one part thereof, but onely death, which I doo desire to take m&eacute;e out of this world. And now s&eacute;eing that I haue so plainely declared vnto you that your counsayle giuen m&eacute;e for my comfort and ease, doth little pro|fit, and therein no remedie nor help is to bee hoped of, I doo most hartelie desire you to speake no more vnto m&eacute;e there|of from this day forwards, for that it is not vnknowen vn|to you how yong and tender I am of age, and that there is no time lost in m&eacute;e for to tarrie, and when time shall serue, I will accomplish and performe all that shall b&eacute;e reason, and whatsoeuer the King my father shall commaund m&eacute;e. And in that you doo say, that peraduenture when I would, then opportunitie will not serue: Lady, you doo know well&punc; that there b&eacute;e many Princes in the world, and other Lords of great estate, and againe, that I am a damsell and daughter vnto such a Father, that with the help of God I shall not remaine by the walls and lost. And h&eacute;erewith the Princesse <HI>Oliuia</HI> dyd holde hir peace, and arose vp from the place whereas sh&eacute;e was, for that <HI>Rodasilua</HI> should not replie any more in hir b&eacute;egunne pretence. Who hearing and wel vnderstanding all that the Princesse hadde sayde vnto hir, with-out any more woords sh&eacute;e departed out of the Closet, and went vnto hir owne lodging, and presentlie sent for the Prince hir brother, and declared vnto him all that sh&eacute;e had passed with the Princesse <HI>Oliuia,</HI> who receiued so great sorrow and griefe, that in a good space h&eacute;e could not speake
<PB REF="174">
one word, but the Princesse <HI>Rodasilua</HI> his sister did comfort him, saying, that hee should b&eacute;e quyet and haue patience, and to dissemble all that possiblie hee could, for that shee hoped with the help of God that time would serue that the Prin|cesse <HI>Oliuia</HI> would b&eacute;e better perswaded, &amp; that shee did b&eacute;e|leeue that all hir sorrow &amp; griefe was for the death of <HI>Ro|sicleer,</HI> &amp; that b&eacute;eing once forgotten, then would she acknow|ledge the great benefit which she should obtain in receiuing so noble a Prince for hir husband, &amp; giue God great thanks for the same. So b&eacute;etwixt the~ there passed much other com|munication about that matter, &amp; in the end they tooke their leaue of one another &amp; departed, but the prince <HI>Don Siluerio</HI> receied so great sorrow &amp; griefe, that a great time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">fter ther neuer entred in him any mirth or pastime, but alwaies in great sadnesse, languishing with the great suspition that hee had of his loue the Princesse <HI>Oliuia,</HI> till such time as h&eacute;e b&eacute;e|thought himselfe of a pollicie, wherby he might remedy him|selfe of his great sorrow and griefe, &amp; beecause opportunitie dyd not serue, hee did delay the time till h&eacute;e did execute it, as shall bee tolde you heereafter in this Historie.</P>

my very friend and Lord, what doe you think is best for vs to do, for to enter into the citie, that we may giue some com|fort vnto those sorrowfull and afflieted <HI>knights.</HI> You doe best know worthy king, what is best to be done in this case, said the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> &amp; therfore if it wer possible before y^t I doe enter, I would very faine know how far the force and strength of these knights doth extend: therefore if it please you, to take the queene behind you vpon your horse, and pro|cure in all that euer you may, for to get vnto the gates of the citie, &amp; cause your <HI>Knights</HI> to k&eacute;epe y^e gates open, for that I will bee ther very quickly. Doe all things according vnto your pleasure said the king, &amp; I pray God to giue vnto you such victory, that our enemies might vnderstand &amp; know, that as yet the king <HI>Liseo,</HI> is neither dead, nor ouercome. So when the night waxed dark, the king in the best maner hee could, he toke the q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">eene behind him on his horse, &amp; embrased the knight of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> shedding many teares, he toke his leaue with the queene, &amp; departed by a narrow lane, which he knew very well, &amp; went towards the citie: &amp; although he met by the way with diuers, yet for all that, hauing no feare by reason that he spake the language very well, they made litle reckoning of him, &amp; did not mistrust y^t he should be any of their enemies. Then the knight of the <HI>Sun</HI> when he suppo|sed that the king had passed the campe, he toke his speare in his hand, &amp; dre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> nigh vnto his enemies: &amp; when he saw them, that they were with out watch, or care of any euill that might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">appen vnto them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e committed himselfe vnto God, &amp; put himselfe amongst his enemies: &amp; with his speare he began to kill &amp; to destroy so many of the <HI>knights</HI> &amp; other souldiers, that his great force &amp; strength was quickly kno|wen, by the number th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">t lay dead in the field.

<P>And after that this valiant <HI>knight</HI> had broken his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">,
<PB N="171" REF="180">
with his swoord in his hands he pressed still forwardes a|mongst them, in such sort, that he seemed to be some infernal creature. And without finding any great resistaunce he ap|proched vnto the tents that were in the field, which were very many &amp; rich, wheras he found in them very many that seemed to be valiant <HI>Knights,</HI> who at the noyse &amp; vpr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">are of the souldiers wer all armed, &amp; in their company many great and deformed giants, that s&eacute;emed to be great towers, who when they saw all the people run away, &amp; saw not their e|nemies follow them, being greatly amazed therat, they stood still &amp; knew not which way to depart, but when the valiant <HI>knights</HI> drew nigh vnto them, the first <HI>knight</HI> that he met withall, he stroke him such a blow vpon his helme, that cl&eacute;e|uing it &amp; his head downe vnto the breast, he ouerthrew him dead to the ground&punc; &amp; turning himselfe about, he stroke ano|ther vpon the wast, that he cut him a sunder in the midst, &amp; ouerthrew him from his horse likewise dead to the ground, which made all the <HI>knights</HI> that wer ther not a litle to mer|uaile, &amp; for that this valiant &amp; worthy <HI>knight</HI> would not at that time tary any longer, he set spurs vnto his furious horse &amp; passed through the camp with so great fury that ther was not one <HI>knight</HI> that could get before him, &amp; being seene by one of the most valiantest giants amongst the rest, with a great mase in his hand he followed him, pretending to strike him with the same. The <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> perceiuing it, tourned about with his horse, &amp; before that the giant could execute his mighty blow with his mase, he stroke him so terrible a blow vpon the wast, that his sharp cutting sword entred into his bowels, that he fell down from his horse dead to the ground, and then without any stayin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> he put himselfe in the mid|dest of the whole campe and made so great a spoile amongst his enemies, that h&eacute;e whom hee found in his way might well thinke himselfe vnhappy. So that they all fledde and ran b&eacute;efore him, as from some infernall creature, that ac|cording vnto the great destruction that he made amongest

them, they thought him to be no other. In this sort this vali|ant <HI>knight</HI> went throughout the whole camp, without find|ing one that was so hardy to disturbe him, &amp; slew w^t his own hands more they two hundreth <HI>knights,</HI> &amp; being all embrued in blood, he came vnto the gates of the citie, wheras he found the king <HI>Liseo,</HI> who being knowen by his <HI>knights</HI> &amp; subiects, did open the gates, &amp; did abide his comming. And when they saw the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> to come, all to be raied with blood, the knig straight waies did imagine what had passed with him &amp; embraced him saying: Oh my good &amp; perfect friend now I am fully perswaded that it hath pleased god to give m&eacute;e full remedy, &amp; set at liberty all my kingdome, onely in that I haue your valiant person h&eacute;ere with me. At this time the most principallest of all the <HI>knights</HI> of the citie came vnto them, &amp; with great contentment &amp; ioy to s&eacute;e their Lord and king they entred into the citie, &amp; commanded the gates to be shut very strongly, &amp; exc&eacute;eding good watch &amp; ward to b&eacute;e kept, &amp; they altogether went vnto the pallace, wheras they were of the qu&eacute;ene meruailously well receiued &amp; entertained and did vnarme the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> with hir own hands, and there they did repose &amp; rest themselues that night, not without great care &amp; complaints vnto their king, to see them|selues in such great affliction, &amp; almost all the people in their Country lost.</P>
<P>Likewise also was the valiant <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> sore trou|bled with his amorous thoughts of the faire princes <HI>Linda|brides,</HI> and of the princesse <HI>Claridiana,</HI> which thoughts were more troublesome vnto him then the furious battaile which he should haue with his enemies the next day following. But when he remembred his brother, and the rest of his friends that were prisoners with <HI>Rodaran,</HI> he receiued so great sor|row &amp; griefe, that he thought long till the day was come, &amp; had a good trust and confidence in God, that very shortly he should s&eacute;e himself cl&eacute;ere from his enemies, &amp; for to haue time to returne vnto the bridge of the iaspe, &amp; to conclude his pre|tence

to combat with <HI>Rodaran.</HI></P>
<P>Likewise at this time all those that were in the campe of the king of <HI>Arcadia,</HI> did not take their rest in perfect quiet|nesse, but when they remembred that which dyd passe with the beginning of the night, they all trembled with theyr great feare which they receiued of that worthy &amp; valiaunt <HI>knight.</HI> And when they had made relation of all that had hap|ned vnto the king of <HI>Arcadia,</HI> he began to blaspheme against his gods, for that it was not his fortune to m&eacute;et with him, &amp; they were all amazed, because they could not vnderstand &amp; know who that valiant <HI>Knight</HI> should b&eacute;e. And againe they were fully perswaded that it could not be the king <HI>Liseo,</HI> for that he was not a <HI>knight</HI> of so great valour, for to make such destruction amongst them, for that they had combatted with him diuers &amp; sundry times&punc; &amp; likewyse others had ben so ventrous as to enter into their camp, but neuer did shew so great force, &amp; the King being very desirous to know who he should be &amp; to s&eacute;e him, he passed away all that night with much more care then any of the rest.</P>

The king gaue them great thanks for their great loyaltie, &amp; did animate their couragious harts in the best wise he could, saying: My good friends and loyall subiects, I haue alwaies had before mine eies the great loue which you do beare me, &amp; now you doe shew it more amply, that you haue kept &amp; defended this my citie, in the time that I haue ben from you in procuring this aid &amp; succour, God for his infinit goodnesse &amp; mercy sake graunt vs victory ouer our enemies, that I may haue oppor|tunitie to gratifie you for this your great loyalty &amp; trauaile.

<P>Worthie King, I am not come hether into this Coun|try, but to serue you with my person, therefore I pray you commaund what w&eacute;e shall doe, for I purpose to b&eacute;e the first that shall obey it, and for my part I giue you to vnderstand that forasmuch as all these your <HI>knights</HI> are very weary<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">

of the battayles past, I my selfe alone this day will goe foorth into the camp, and there to procure all that is in my power agaynst your enimies, for that principally with the fauour of almightie God I will doo so much, that they shall receiue damage and griefe. But when the King <HI>Lyseo</HI> and all his <HI>Knights</HI> heard those woords, they meruayled great|lie at the mightie stomake and courage of the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> and with great admiration did b&eacute;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">olde him, and it dyd seeme vnto them a thing impossible that in a <HI>Knight</HI> of so few y&eacute;eres should remaine so great force and strength, that h&eacute;e alone should offer to put himselfe into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">field a|gainst more then twentie thousand <HI>Knights,</HI> and as many more souldiers that were in the camp of the King of <HI>Arca|dia,</HI> whereas was amongst them the brauest <HI>Knights</HI> and Gyants that were in the Pagan Countrie. Then the good king <HI>Lyseo</HI> who could not by any meanes abide to remaine in the Cittie, sayde, that h&eacute;e might doo all that his pleasure was to commaund, but h&eacute;e would not in any manner of wise remaine b&eacute;ehinde in the Citie, but that hee would also goe out in his companie.

The first a|mongst all those Knights that went foorth, was Brother vnto the King, called <HI>Momfriero,</HI> a valiant Knight and stout of his person, and worthie in feates of armes, and such a one, that in all the Pagan Countrie there was found verie few, so gallant and so liuelie in any kinde of exercise, and meruailous presumptious, who b&eacute;eing mounted vppon a great and furious courser whet out of the camp, and with great threatnings and oaths h&eacute;e swore that with the first encounter that hee should make with his speare, for to bring him prisoner vnto the King. When h&eacute;e came vnto the place whereas the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> was, with great pride and arrogancie h&eacute;e sayde.</P>
<P>Tell m&eacute;e thou simple and captiue Knight, what great boldnesse and folly is this of thine, that thou b&eacute;eing but one alone, darest for to sound thy horne against so great an ar|mie as this is, wheras ther be knights sufficient for to con|quer the whole world, and h&eacute;ere I dooe sweare vnto thee by the high Gods, that b&eacute;efore it b&eacute;e long I will giue th&eacute;e thy reward for this thy great follie, b&eacute;ecause thou shalt not ad|uaunce thy selfe h&eacute;ere after, how that before <HI>Momfriero</HI> thou diddest this or that. And in saying those woords h&eacute;e drew nigh vnto him, reseruing that which was requisit for the course of his horse, and with his speare in his hand he came against the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne;</HI> who wished&punc; and desired no other thing, and with the force of his horse <HI>Cornerino</HI> h&eacute;e made against him, and although the course was very long, yet with a trice they met together with so great fury, that the earth seemed to tremble vnder them, they made theyr encounter in such sort, that the valiant pagan sh&eacute;euered his

Then the king of <HI>Arcadia,</HI> who from his Tent did b&eacute;eholde all that passed, b&eacute;eing greatly amazed to s&eacute;e his brother ouerthrowen, sent another knight called <HI>Rufier,</HI> who was a great Lord in <HI>Ar|cadia,</HI> and one of the most brauest that h&eacute;e had in all the camp, who being mounted on a mighty courser went out of the camp, with so great pride &amp; arrogancie, that h&eacute;e thought verely to reuenge the iniurie done vnto <HI>Momfriero,</HI> but his expectation fell out cleane contrarie, for when h&eacute;e came to make his encounter with the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> h&eacute;e gaue him such a blow with his speare, that he pearced him quite through, that h&eacute;e ouerthrew him dead vnto the ground, and breaking his speare therewith, h&eacute;e drew out his great and sharp cutting swoord, and in his companie the King <HI>Lyseo,</HI> they put themselues into the presse of the Campe whereas they made great slaughter, killing and ouerthrowing as though they had b&eacute;en all naked without armour: Oh how ioyfull were all those of the Citie, when they saw the great meruailes of their Captaines, and theyr great boun|tie and surmounted strength, and to the contrarie how the King of <HI>Arcadia</HI> was amazed when that h&eacute;e saw two alone knights for to doo so great murther and destruction in his mightie and puissant armie, and sayde with himselfe, that if all the world should haue tould him the lyke, h&eacute;e could not haue b&eacute;el&eacute;eued it, except h&eacute;e had s&eacute;ene it with his owne eyes, and for that h&eacute;e would s&eacute;e more of theyr wonderfull d&eacute;edes, h&eacute;e dyd not procure to arme himselfe, neither would h&eacute;e mooue fro~ the place whereas h&eacute;e was&punc; but

At this time was well perceiued the migh|ti and valyaunt courage of the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> who was so furious and fierce in his battaile, that whereas the King <HI>Lyseo</HI> did kill or wound one, hee for his part did kill foure, so that they slew b&eacute;etwixt them that day more then three hundreth <HI>Knights,</HI> and in the ende there went foorth to make resistance against them two great and stout Gyants, and with their mightie mases in their hands, they went towards the place whereas the <HI>Knights</HI> were. Then the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> b&eacute;ecause they should not take so great paines as to come vnto them whereas they were, but seeing them a far off to come towards them, hee went foorth to m&eacute;ete them, and scarcely they could haue so much lea|sure as to life vp theyr mases for to strike them, when that the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> with great lightnesse stroke one of those Gyants with his swoord in both his hands so terri|ble a blow vpon his right shoulder, that hee cut him downe to his bowells, in such sort, that the fore quarter with his right arme did part from his body, and he fell from his horse dead to the ground.

At which time the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> was embraced with other <HI>Knights,</HI> and the Gyaunt lyft vp his

<PB N="188" REF="197">
and because his mighty cutting sword could not enter ther in, yet it tooke away the sight of his eies, &amp; ther flew so many sparks of fire out therat, that it s&eacute;emed the whole helme, to burne ther with, but yet for all that this valiant warriour was nothing amazed or astonied thereat, but procuring to giue him his payment for the same, stroke him so terrible a blow, that out of all remembrance he made him fall backe|wards vpon his horse crouper, &amp; his horse caried him round about the field, voiding at his mouth &amp; nose great abundance of blood. But when his brother <HI>Pirro</HI> saw that, bel&eacute;euing y^t he had ben slaine, h&eacute;e stroke such a blow at the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> that he made him to loose the raines of his horse bridle, &amp; was therwith som what astonied, &amp; b&eacute;eing not fully cleere from the fury thereof, when that the stout <HI>Breo</HI> stroke him another blow vpon his hard healme, that the noise &amp; sound therof was heard a good way&punc; &amp; the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> so ouer|charged therwith, that he declined with his head downe to his horse neck, &amp; as <HI>Gruto</HI> came vnto him to strike him an other blow, thinking therby to ouerthrow him out of his sad|dle, with great lightnes he raised himselfe againe, &amp; with the great ire the which hee had, hee stroke such an ouerthwart blow at <HI>Alberro</HI> with both his hands in the midst of all his body, that be all to brused his armour, &amp; with the great force therof he broke his ribs &amp; his gall within his body, in such sort, that h&eacute;e fell from his horse downe to the ground: Oh how much was the great sorow &amp; griefe which the king re|ceiued when he saw that terrible and wonderfull blow, for that his cosin was very rich &amp; a <HI>knight</HI> that was best belo|ued aboue all other <HI>knights</HI> that he had and also for that he conceiued within his mind, that if that <HI>knight</HI> should endure long, that h&eacute;e would not leaue one <HI>knight</HI> aliue in all the whole camp that is of any reputation.</P>
<P>So with the great griefe which the losse of his <HI>knights</HI> caused him to haue, with a trise he caused himselfe to be ar|med with his strong armour, which was a finger thick of very fine st&eacute;ele, and so good as any was in all the world,

and being mounted on a strong &amp; light horse he went out of the camp with his speare in his hand, saying: Oh that my fortune wer so good, that as I go against this valiant <HI>knight,</HI> I might make battaile against all my false gods, in whom I haue beleeued &amp; put my confidence, for if they were all a|gainst me, &amp; they were <HI>knights</HI> in this world, I think verily to ouercome them all, &amp; make them to know &amp; vnderstand that the power &amp; strength of this <HI>knight</HI> is much more then theirs. The king had not fully concluded in saying these words, when the valiant <HI>Pirro</HI> with one blow that the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> gaue him with his swoord, fell from his horse as though h&eacute;e had b&eacute;ene dead, but when the King saw that, with wonderfull force he went towards him, &amp; with a great &amp; broad fauchon in his hand he stroke the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> vpon the helme, that it tooke way the sight of his eyes, &amp; de|priued him of his vnderstanding, and his horse caried him a while about the field, for you shall vnderstand that y^e king of <HI>Arcadia</HI> was so stout &amp; couragious a <HI>knight,</HI> that neuer any <HI>knight</HI> with whom he did make battaile with, could endure with him a whole day in the field, &amp; was of great fame and feared amongst the pagans, but yet he did not goe away boa|sting himselfe of this blow, for the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> before the king could strike him the second, returned &amp; came again to himself, &amp; set spurs vnto his horse, &amp; came running against the king like a whirle wind, &amp; with his swoord in both his hands he stroke him such a blow vpon his healme, that h&eacute;e made him to fall forwards vpon his horse necke, &amp; the blood ran out both at his mouth &amp; nose, and his horse carried him round about the field out of his remembrance, as though he had ben dead, at which time <HI>Alberro</HI> was come againe to himselfe, and he and <HI>Gruto</HI> together did terribly assault the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> chargeing him with great and heauye blowes, the which he felt and grieued him very much for though his armour did defend him from wounding, yet for all that it could not excuse him, but that his flesh must haue

At this time it was more then three houres since their battaile b&eacute;egan, without taking any rest either of them, and those that beeheld them waxed wea|rie, and likewise the <HI>Pagans</HI> meruailously tormented with the mightie blowes which they had receiued, and the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> more angrie &amp; wrathfull then h&eacute;e was all the day beefore, and his anger did so far exceede, and his force so much increase, y^t at one blow he ouerthrew the stout <HI>Gruto</HI> to the ground, and with an other blow he ouerthrew <HI>Pirro,</HI> but the valiant <HI>Berro</HI> stroke him so strong a blow vpon his helme, that h&eacute;e made him to stoupe &amp; decline his head to his horse neck, but he made no brags therof, for that the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> returned his payment with so great furie and force, that buckling his helme, &amp; breaking therewith all to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">&eacute;eces the skull of his head, h&eacute;e ouerthrew him dead to the ground, and with a trise hee turned vpon the king of <HI>Arca|dia,</HI> who was comming against him to strike him, and strok
<PB REF="199">
him such an ouerthwart blow on the one side, that he ouer|threw him on the other side. Then this valiant and worthy knight without any longer staying amongst them, but with as great fury as a whirle wind he put himselfe in the midst of the whole armie, and wounded &amp; slew so many, that al the way wheras h&eacute;e went, h&eacute;e left it full of dead bodies, so that ther was not one in all the camp that durst make resistance against him, but passed through amongst them, as commonly the bayted Bull, beeing well pricked with darts dooth passe through a co~pany of men. At this time the day passed away, and night came on, and this valiant Knight somwhat wea|rie with wounding and killing of Pagans, all to b&eacute;e brued with blood h&eacute;e departed out of the Camp, and without any following him he came vnto the gates of the citie, the which were straight wais opened, and h&eacute;e found at the entrie in therat, the king <HI>Lyseo&punc;</HI> all armed in a readinesse to goe foorth in his aide and help, if h&eacute;e were driuen to any necessitie, of whom h&eacute;e was receiued with great ioy &amp; pleasure, and the gates b&eacute;eing shut, they went vnto the pallace, whereas with great mirth and ioy they were receiued by the qu&eacute;ene, and supped together with great ioy and pleasure, and tooke their ease all that night, and the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> determined not to goe foorth other two daies to the battaile.</P>

What might heere be thought of the great ioy and pleasure which this amorous and va|liant <HI>knight</HI> conceiued, when that in that time and place h&eacute;e found himselfe in the presenc&eacute; of his Lady and mistres, hauing seene what shee had done for him beefore hee knew hir. Truely this mirth and gladnesse was so much, that h&eacute;e thought all his vnderstanding to bee transported into a ce|lestiall glory whereas the chosen doth remaine, and going towards hir, he said: Your soueraigne beauty may please to giue vnto mee your se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">re hands, that I may kisse them, in acknowledging of the great curtesie which all wee haue receyued by your soueraigne aide and succour, and for that all enterprises which I doe take in hand may haue credit, it shall be done in your seruice and prayse, as I am bound,

and likewise all good and valyaunt Knights in the world. Then the Princesse who receiued great contentment at his words, layd hir armes vpon his shoulders and sayd: Wor|thie Prince, your politike dealings and excellent bountie sooth so far excell, that it is not needefull for m&eacute;e to expresse the same, neyther any other, but onely to b&eacute;ehold what is done by your valiant hands heere in this Camp, and vnto this there is good witnesse, who is the king <HI>Liseo</HI> and all his knights. And passing beetwixt them many other amorous words, the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> dyd tell them all how and by what aduenture h&eacute;e came thether, and all that happened with him after hee departed out of <HI>Greece.</HI> The like dyd the Princesse <HI>Claridiana,</HI> so that all the whole companie vnder|stood by what order they were there assembled and ioyned. In the meane time that they were in this acknowledging one another, those of <HI>Lidia</HI> were not idle, for they minded no other thing but to robbe and destroy all that were in the Tents and Campe of the King of <HI>Arcadia,</HI> and finding there great store of riches and treasure which the king had brought, euery one of them did so lade themselues, that euer after they remayned very rich, and thought their long and great trauaile to bee well employed, the end fell out so pros|perous vnto them. Then the Emperour <HI>Trebatio</HI> out of hand commaunded that the Qu&eacute;ene <HI>Carmania</HI> should b&eacute;e brought b&eacute;efore him, for there should b&eacute;e no harme done vnto hir, who when sh&eacute;e thought verily that <HI>Rodaran</HI> had b&eacute;ene slayne, tare hir haire, and dyd such iustice on hir selfe, that they thought verily it would bee hir death. And asking of them whether the king of <HI>Arcadia</HI> and <HI>Rodaran</HI> were aliue or dead, they went straight wayes vnto the place whereas they lay a long vppon the ground, and commaunded that theyr Healmes, should b&eacute;e pulled off, and fresh water to bee throwen vpon their face to refresh them, &amp; straight wayes they came agayne vnto themselues, and when they vnder|stood in what estate and perplexity they were all this time, their sorrow and griefe was such, that they thought it had b&eacute;ene better for them to haue beene slaine, then to suffer so

great misfortune: but when the King of <HI>Arcadia,</HI> dyd look<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> about him for his armie, and could s&eacute;e neuer a Knight on his part, but those that were slayne and lay in the field, with very sorrow and griefe h&eacute;e thought verely his heart would haue burst. Likewise when <HI>Rodaran,</HI> saw all his pri|soners at libertie, and h&eacute;e ouercome by one alone Knight, the great sorrow and griefe which he receiued, could not b&eacute;e h&eacute;ere expressed, and if hee had had his helme and his swoord, and on horsebacke, hee would haue tarryed there no longer. Then strayght wayes the King <HI>Lyseo,</HI> dyd desire all these worthie warriers, to repaire vnto the Citie for to refresh themselues, and to take their ease, who consented vnto his request, and went towards the citie, and carryed with them theyr prisoners, whereas they were receiued of all the Ci|tizens and nobles of all the kingdome, that were there pre|sent, with so great ioy and triumphes, that the whole Citie seemed to b&eacute;e on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">, with the great bonefiers &amp; other lights which were made in euery streete of the Citie, not remem|bring any of their troubles past. So when they came vnto the Queenes pallace, who was very wyse and discr&eacute;ete, sh&eacute;e receiued them with such courtesie, as was requisit to so no|ble persons: whereas they were all vnarmed, and recrea|ted with verie sw&eacute;et waters and oyntments requisit for such hurts and bruses as they had receiued. For although theyr armour dyd defend them from wounding, yet could not their flesh b&eacute;e free from bruses, by the force of such terri|ble blowes as they receiued. And in especiall the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> in the battaile which h&eacute;e had with <HI>Rodaran,</HI> and the King of <HI>Arcadia,</HI> although hee est&eacute;emed it in nothing, with the great contentment and pleasure which hee recei|ued in seeing b&eacute;efore him the fayre Princesse <HI>Claridiana,</HI> not h&eacute;e alone who loued hir as his owne soule, dyd receiue con|tentment, but likewise the Emperour, &amp; the other princes &amp; <HI>knights</HI> did reioyse very much, &amp; had hir in that reputation as hir high estate deserued. So in this sort they passed away all that night in great pastimes &amp; pleasure, till the next day in the morning, in the which the king <HI>Liseo,</HI> went vnto the
<PB N="198" REF="207">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">mperour and vnto the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> &amp; asked of them what their pleasures was to doo with the king of <HI>Arcadia,</HI> &amp; <HI>Rodaran,</HI> for that they were their prisoners. To whom the Emperor said&punc; that those prisoners did b&eacute;elong vnto y^e <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> and how that h&eacute;e would giue order what should b&eacute;e done with the~. The <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> when that he heard that, he would very faine haue excused himselfe therof, but it did little profit him his excuses, but that generally it was concluded, that all should be done as he would command it. So hee seeing their determination, co~manded to bee brought before him <HI>Rodaran,</HI> and the king of <HI>Arcadia,</HI> vnto whom h&eacute;e said. The high estates great riches &amp; soueraine gifts which fortune y&eacute;eldeth in this world, &amp; by the wil of god is depar|ted amongst men, often times is the occasion that pride doth increase, the more in them: &amp; hauing cleane forgotten that they are mortal, and subiect vnto any misfortune. Contrary vnto all reason they put themselues in exercises to compre|hend things of great waite and no lesse perillo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s, as though there were not a god to withstand the~, thinking themselues to haue power ouer all fortune: from whence doth proceede, that whe~ they thinke the~selues most surest and most highest in their throne, lacking the chiefe and principall ground of reason and iustice, the wh&eacute;ele of their hope, being very swift and of no securitie, turneth about, and throweth downe vnto the ground, that which is most highest, in such sort, that ther is no humaine creature able to resist, so great force. And so it hath happened vnto you, for being made Lords and kings ouer great and mightie Kingdomes, and likewise endewed with force and strength, yet there increased in you so great pride, that all s&eacute;emed little, the which you had of your owne, but against all reason &amp; iustice, you came to s&eacute;eke that which at such time as you thought all concluded and ended, then were you farthest of, and brought in that estate that you doo well vnderstand &amp; know, how little the power of men is, whe~ in wrongfull causes you apply your selues Now in the behalfe of the Emperour my lord, &amp; these knights I require you to sweare to be true to King <HI>Liseo</HI> and his kingdome.

<P>At which words of the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> the two Kings receiued no great contentment, for they were so rooted in pride &amp; mischiefe, that it could not be rooted out till such time as they were vtterly ouerthrowen and lost in the fields of <HI>Grecia</HI> but now seeing in what estate they were, &amp; how that it did behoue the~ to shew more patience then they had, they swore before the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> to performe &amp; fulfill all that he would demand them, &amp; for theyr libertie which they receiued at their hands they gaue great thanks.

So concluding together, they determined the fourth day in the morning to depart. The time beeing come, they all dyd take theyr leaue of the Qu&eacute;ene, who shed many teares to s&eacute;e them depart, and the king <HI>Liseo</HI> went to beare them companie till they came to the sea side, for they could not by any meanes cause him to abide in the Citie. So they trauailed seauen daies, in the ende whereof they came vnto the Sea, whereas the king did take his leaue of them, embracing them all, offering himselfe at their commaunde|ment at all times when occasion should serue. And after that hee was departed fro~ them, hee found himselfe very so|litary without their company, and in especiall without the companie of the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> for that hee esteemed more his company and friendship then all his whole King|dome. The Emperour and all those that went with him dyd imbarke themselues in a very good Shippe, and tooke their way towards <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and hauing the winde and weather very fayre and prisoners, they made theyr nauigation whith great ioy and pleasure generally amongst them all, but in especially the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> who fin|ding himselfe alwayes in presence of the royall Princesse <HI>Claridiana,</HI> hee was as pleasant and ioyfull as euer hee was in all his life, and although many times all the rest that were in the ship, were at the ship side sporting themselues, when that hee had opportunitie to speake and vtter his minde, yet for all that hee had so great respect vnto hir, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">t seemed vnto him that hee lacked bouldnesse to vtter vnto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ir his paine and griefe, and for that the royall Princesse, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">either more nor lesse then h&eacute;e was, troubled with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">morous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">assions, dyd not let at all tymes to make some outwarde <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ew thereof, which was the occasion that it caused him so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ake heart at grasse, and speake vnto hir, who with no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">sse curtesie and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">, as the Pagans <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> vse when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ey doo <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">&punc; and worship theyr false Gods, in such sort

And as soone as it was knowen throughout the great Cit|tie, there were very few that remained, but they went forth to m&eacute;ete theyr good Lord, the Emperour and his sons, and receiued them with so great ioy and pleasure as though they had b&eacute;ene theyr owne kinsfolkes or children, and had b&eacute;ene very long absent from them. So they entered into the great pallace, whereas of the Empresse they were receiued with that ioy and contentment, as in such like absence may b&eacute;e conceiued, and with no small complaining of the Empresse vnto the Emperour, for that h&eacute;e all alone, and without gi|uing hir to vnderstand, would goe foorth and put himselfe into so great perill.

<HEAD>&para; How the Empresse Briana was deliuered of a sonne, and of the great feasts that were made at his birth. Chapter. 52</HEAD>
<P>_IT is said in this famous history that the mightie emperour <HI>Trebatio</HI> had another and the third son, by the faire empresse <HI>Briana,</HI> of whom is made great mencion in the second part of this history, for that was one of the most mightiest &amp; famous <HI>knights</HI> in all the world, &amp; that next vnto his singuled bretheren the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> &amp; <HI>Rosicleer,</HI> ther was none equall vnto him, &amp; many times combatting with his bretheren vnknowen, he put the~ in great hazard, &amp; with either of them he hath maintayned battaile almost a whole day, &amp; in the end it was very small the vantage they had of him, so that this valiant <HI>knight</HI> did finish so many mortall d&eacute;edes, that they deserue to be spoken of, &amp; to be put in the number of his bretheren, &amp; in all other things, as in body &amp; stature, he was conformable &amp; equal vn|to them, &amp; did resemble so much the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> in his face, that many times he was taken for him, &amp; if it were not that he was of fewer y&eacute;eres, with great difficulty might you know the one from the other. This valiant &amp; fortunat prince, as the wise <HI>Artemidoro</HI> saith, was borne straight after the emperour and all his company came from the kingdome of <HI>Lidia,</HI> for that when that stout Pagan <HI>Rodaran</HI> came into <HI>Greece,</HI> the empresse was very big with child. It doth ap&eacute;ere that the wise <HI>Lirgandeo</HI> doth make difference, for h&eacute;e doth make no mencion of this yong gentleman, till the conclusion of the great battailes which they passed betw&eacute;ene the empe|rour <HI>Alicandro</HI> of <HI>Tartaria,</HI> and the Emperour <HI>Trebatio</HI> of <HI>Greece,</HI> from which time he doth declare meruailous &amp; won|derfull things done by him. I doe bel&eacute;eue that the occasion of this is, because that the wise <HI>Lirgandeo</HI> did not s&eacute;e him, till

such time as he came into <HI>Greece,</HI> &amp; made no mention of him till all the battaile was finished, &amp; at such time as the empe|rour &amp; all the rest tooke their rest with great ioy &amp; pleasure, after the great trauaile which they receiued in the wars past, for that at this time the young gentleman, was verye tender of yeares, &amp; passed not sixe y&eacute;eres of age, so that till that time ther is no more mention made of him, then is in this chapter, but afterwards these two wise men doe begin to writ of him meruailous great &amp; wonderfull d&eacute;eds, &amp; doo both agr&eacute;e in their writings. When the time was come that this royall empresse should be deliuered ther chaunced a thing of great admiration &amp; meruaile, which did shew &amp; declare a very high and great mistery in the birth of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">hild, which was that night and very moment that he was borne, the Moone did shine so bright &amp; cleere, &amp; threw from hir such glistering beames of light, that it seemed to bee the <HI>Sun,</HI> &amp; the most part of all the earth was so cl&eacute;ere, as com|monly it is in the morning, when the <HI>Sunne</HI> doth spred hir beames abroad. This was seene iust at midnight, &amp; did en|dure for the space of halfe a quarter of an houre, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> it put all those that saw it in great admiration, &amp; those which after|wards heard tell thereof, &amp; greatly meruailing thereat, they demaunded of the wise men what that strange token might singnifie, &amp; ther was none that could declare the signification therof, but onely the wise <HI>Artemidore,</HI> who was at that pre|sent in <HI>Constantinople,</HI> who did tell them plainly that it did pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">nosticat &amp; shew that the features &amp; deedes of that yong prince, should so cl&eacute;erely shine in the obscure &amp; dark regions of the barbarous people, as the moone did shew hir shining light, in the obsure darknesse of the night.

<P><PB N="203" REF="212">_LOng time was the Princesse <HI>Lindabrides</HI> in the court of the Emperour <HI>Trebatio,</HI> without hauing any mirth, ioy or pleasure, for that she saw that the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> did frequent very much with the princesse <HI>Claridiana,</HI> and that it seemed vnto hir that he did not loue hir, as before time he did, &amp; being fully perswaded, that alone the presence of the princesse was the occasion of all hir euill, many times she imagined with hir selfe how and by what meanes she might take him away from the same, for that hir great beauty might take effect in him, so that sh&eacute;e might liue in more security, and for that hir minde was alwaies troubled ther with, in the end sh&eacute;e determined to doo as you shall heare. Upon a day at such time as was ioyned together the Emperour &amp; all the Princes and worthy <HI>knights</HI> of the court with the empresse &amp; the princesse <HI>Claridiana,</HI> &amp; all their Ladies &amp; gentlewomen, making great feasts &amp; pastimes in the great hall, at such time as they were most in quiet, the princesse <HI>Lindabrides</HI> rose vp &amp; stood on hir f&eacute;et, &amp; when they saw hir demeanour they all held their peace.</P>
<P>Then she began to speake saying.</P>
<P>High &amp; mightie Emperour of <HI>Greece,</HI> if valiant princes &amp; mightie <HI>knights</HI> for the maintaining of their honours, are bound to respect ladies &amp; damsels in their necessities, as by their promise &amp; oath made, at such time as they doe receiue the order of <HI>knighthood:</HI> in how much more are bound so high princes &amp; <HI>knights</HI> as are heere present, to respect a dam|sell of so high estate as I am, who is banished from hir natu|ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">l contr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">, &amp; come into this, as vnto the court of the most hghest king &amp; emperour in all the world. And heere I say of truth that if the remedy of my necessitie doth now faile me according as I would haue it, &amp; denied me by so high princes, with iust reason may I account my selfe for an vnhappye damsell. Therfore now in the presence of you all I doo aske a boone of the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> who is heere present, y^e which
<PB REF="213">
I doe request that it may be by him granted vnto me, and likewise consented, by you most high &amp; mighty Emperour &amp; Empresse. All that were ther present were very much ama|zed at the words of the princesse, not knowing what should be the occasion why she should aske that boone. And first shee would haue the grant before she would declare hir demand. Then the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> s&eacute;eing that the princesse would not declare, but first he must be bound, he was somewhat in a confusion, although he made no outward shew therof: but vpon a sodaine, he arose vp, &amp; answered hir, saying. My good Lady, if the dutie which I haue to serue so high a damsell as you are, you doo not esteeme in more, then in giuing of my word, h&eacute;ere I doo graunt vnto you the boone, which you haue asked of me, although of the securitie I am agr&eacute;eued, accor|ding to the benefits which I haue receiued. Uery well sayd the princesse, s&eacute;eing that you haue granted me of your part, likewise I desire the emperour, &amp; my Lady the empresse, to consent &amp; graunt vnto the same, that I may b&eacute;e sure of all parts. We doo graunt vnto the same, said the Emperour &amp; the empresse, laughing very much at the security which the princesse <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">emanded. Now shall you vnderstand the boone the which I doo craue, saide the Princesse. For so much as the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> did ouercome the prince <HI>Meridian</HI> my bro|ther, &amp; that I remained in his power, that now he cary me vnto the court of the Emperour my father, whereas it is great reason that I doo retourne, being so long since my de|parture from thence. And this I will that he shall doo, with|out hauing the company of any other. When the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> heard the boone which the princesse demaunded, hee was in a great confusion, but the princesse <HI>Claridiana,</HI> was in a greater, but yet sh&eacute;e made signes vnto him with hir eyes, that h&eacute;e should grant vnto hir all that euer sh&eacute;e would de|maund, for that it seemed vnto hir, that with his hon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ur he could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> to the contrary, &amp; ther the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> did promise hir to beare hir company till shee came vnto the

So that in this contension &amp; rigor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">us combat, these two endured more then two houres, &amp; euery blow that was stroke, did make each other to doubt of his life. And for that I will not b&eacute;e tedious, to tell all things perticulerly, the which was done in this well foughten &amp; perillous battaile, I will conclude &amp; tell you what hapned in the end.

In this sort the euill <HI>Fulmineo</HI> did make his end, &amp; his soule condempned vnto hell, wheras with continuall tor|ment he is plagued for his euill d&eacute;eds, as shall be done vnto those that in this world with so great pride doth commit y^e like offence, if that by the permission of god he doth not repe~t him of them before he die, for that his neighbour b&eacute;eing by him iniured, at the day of iudgement he will aske vengea~ce of the same.

I did send to bannish th&eacute;e out of my presence, for that I might not perill my selfe with thy continuall presence, but in doo|ing that, I did bannish my owne soule from my body, whose absence shall continue &amp; endure so long, as thou art absent from me, &amp; am so far from reason, &amp; so void of memory, since the time that thou departedst from this court, that when I doo consider of my owne life, I know not whether I liue or dreme, or whether I am a woman or monster, for that life is odious vnto me, and I doo abhorre all pleasure, &amp; the com|pany of my damsels is great griefe vnto me, &amp; when I am alone I am tormented, my eares are deafe &amp; doo not heare, my eies blind &amp; cannot see, &amp; my tongue dumbe and cannot speake, except it be to name <HI>Rosicleer,</HI> in such sort are all my sences prisoners vnto thee, that in no other thing they doo occupy themselues in, but onely in accusing me for the error the which I haue committed against thee: my eies say that they are blinde, for that they cannot see the goodnesse that they were wont to see, my eares deafe, for that they cannot heare that continuall praise which they were wont, of thy person, the telling of thy mighty deeds, the victorye of thy perillous battailes, the great fame of thy high <HI>knighthood,</HI>

<P>When <HI>Rosicleer</HI> had read this Letter, and knew it to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> hirs, what shall I say vnto the great ioy &amp; pleasure which h&eacute;e receiued, but that it was equall vnto the great sorrow and griefe which h&eacute;e suffered, for that as one from him selfe h&eacute;e was reading, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> did not contemplate himselfe with those sw&eacute;et and amorous words of his Lady and mistres, and the great loue which sh&eacute;e dyd professe in hir letter, and how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> did repent hir selfe of all that was past, of all the which h&eacute;e receiued so great ioy and contentment, that all his sences were occupyed therewith, in such sort that h&eacute;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> him selfe transported into the celestiall glorie, so that h&eacute;e had no tongue for to speake vnto the King <HI>Sacridoro,</HI> neyther f&eacute;ete for to remoue himself out of that place, nor eies for to looke vpon <HI>Fidelia,</HI> but onely occupied in recreating himself in that contemplation, reading and b&eacute;eholding that Letter many times. In the ende h&eacute;e remembred himselfe as one that dyd awake out of a dreame, and went vnto the King <HI>Sacridoro,</HI> and embraced him &amp; sayd: Oh my Lord &amp; perfect friend, I desire you to put me out of all doubt of this doubtfull thing which I haue b&eacute;efore m&eacute;e, for that you shall vnderstand, that looke how much the glorie is which at this present I re|ceiue, so much more will the paine and griefe b&eacute;e vnto m&eacute;e if it fall out otherwise.</P>
<P>Therefore tell m&eacute;e (I pray you,) whether I doo sl&eacute;epe or am awake, or whether it b&eacute;e true that I doo now s&eacute;e, or whether it b&eacute;e one of those dreames which I was wont to haue, doo not let m&eacute;e I pray you to liue deceiued, for that is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ot reason, one so vnhappie and voyde of good fortune as I

B&eacute;ehould how I doo dreame that the Prin|cesse <HI>Oliuia</HI> hath sent mee a Letter by hir secretarie <HI>Fidelia,</HI> and hauing compassion on mee, sh&eacute;e would that I should b&eacute;e hirs, and to goe into <HI>England</HI> for to serue hir, and b&eacute;e at hir commandement, and doth write to me such amorous words, that there is no humane creature that dooth deserue the same, much lesse a man that is so forgotten as I am: B&eacute;e|hould h&eacute;ere <HI>Fidelia,</HI> heere is the Letter, the hand and seale of my Lady and mistres, the Princesse Oliuia: Tell m&eacute;e I pray you, whether I doo sl&eacute;epe or dreame, and whether it bee true this which I doo s&eacute;e. The King did not meruayle much at all this which passed b&eacute;ecause h&eacute;e dyd very well vnder|stand the operation of loue, but embracing him, he tooke him by the hand and sayde: Oh my Lord <HI>Rosicleer</HI> and perfect friend, now I doo s&eacute;e the great wonders of God, and how great his mercie is, for that h&eacute;e dooth forget none that doth put their trust in him, for when I was very prosperous in riches, high <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> estate, and accompanied with all my vassalls and subiects, and in soueraigne hope for to ouercome, and haue that which I most desired, straight waies I found my selfe very far from the easement of my griefe, and the ende of al my desire separated, for that I was ouerthrowen from my estate, and all my kingdome destroyed, my people ouer|come and left desolate without my vassalls, and bannished, out of mine owne Countrie, and throwen out into the world, &amp; sunke into a lake whereas I found all that which I desire, remedie for my sorrow, and recouered againe my Kingdome, and restored vnto mine owne estate, and aboue all things, I recouered a good &amp; perfect friend of you, there|fore all aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">iction and tribulation in the world, God dooth permit it vnto them that h&eacute;e doth not forget, and when they dooe thincke themselues most afflicted and troubled, ouer|throwen and brought most low, and most without all hope, and voyde of all goodnesse, at such time with a trise and in a moment they are brought into more higher estate then they were b&eacute;efore, with ioy and prosperitie,

At which words of the King, <HI>Rosicleer</HI> came wholie to himselfe, and hauing no hart to speake, with the great ioy h&eacute;e receiued, h&eacute;e embraced the King and <HI>Fidilia</HI> many times, and by exteriour tokens and signes, h&eacute;e dyd communicate his pleasure and ioye vnto them. Then afterwards <HI>Rosi|cleer</HI> demaunded of <HI>Fidelia</HI> all what had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> by whome h&eacute;e vnderstoode all that euer shee dyd know of the Prin|cesse <HI>Oliuia,</HI> for there shee made manifest vnto him hir lyfe, hir passions, and hir cares, and all that euer had passed in the Letters, and how by them shee vnderstood him to b&eacute;e Sonne vnto the Princesse <HI>Briana,</HI> and afterward it was published that h&eacute;e was sonne vnto the Emperour <HI>Trebatio.</HI> Likewise shee toulde him the occasion of the writing of the first Letter, and the great repentance which she had for the same, the great anguish and griefe shee had for <HI>Don Siluerio,</HI> the great good will of the king hir father, and the great im|portance hee vsed, also the great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> of the Princesse <HI>Oliuia,</HI> all which when <HI>Rosicleer</HI> heard, hee was as you may iudge of all them that faitfully and truely dooe loue, at such time as they are giuen to vnderstand any thing of their best beeloued: the which things vnto such as are free from all loue are counted but tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">fles, and childrens toyes, where|as to the contrarie vnto them they are pearles and preci|ous stones.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="224">Then the King s&eacute;eing them in this profound and d&eacute;epe rehearsall, tooke him by the hands and sayd: My good Lord let all these matters passe for this time, and let vs vnder|stand that which dooth most accomplish you, which is to goe into <HI>England,</HI> whereas you shall vnderstand and know all these matters of the Princesse <HI>Oliuia,</HI> for that I doo perceiue by the long trauayle, in the which <HI>Fidelia</HI> hath gone, in see|king of you, that you delay the time very long.</P>
<P><Q>Then <HI>Rosicleer,</HI> as thou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">h h&eacute;e did awake out of a sound sl&eacute;epe came vnto himselfe, and savd.

And I doo desire of God, to graunt m&eacute;e lyfe, that I may gratifie your large pilgrimage, which you haue pas|sed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">n seeking mee. And tourning himselfe vnto the King, hee sayde: Pardon mee, I pray you my good Lord, these my amorous passions, and let vs goe whether your pleasure is to command vs, without tarrying any longer. So straight wayes they commaunded the kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ghts of <HI>Fulmineo,</HI> to bring before them all the Ladies and damsels, that were in all the Castels. And b&eacute;eing brought b&eacute;efore them, they were more then thirtie, all very faire and full of sorrow. All the which <HI>Rosicleer,</HI> dyd commaund, that they should goe and present <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">hemselues b&eacute;efore the Emperour of <HI>Russia</HI> in saying, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">wo <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Knights,</HI> hath slaine <HI>Fulmineo,</HI> and that they doo <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">urrender and yee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">d vnto him all his Countrie and lands, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">or that <HI>Fulmineo,</HI> hath left no heire.

<PB REF="225">
So the next day, at such time as the Sunne did scarce ap|peare, when they were armed with their rich &amp; bright ar|mour, and mounted vpon their good horses, these two valy|ant knights and perfect friends went forth of the castle, and in their company the damsell <HI>Fidelia,</HI> leauing a good Knight which was <HI>Fulmineos</HI> in the gard and k&eacute;eping of the Castle and all the rest, till such time as the Emperour of <HI>Russia</HI> dyd commaund his pleasure to b&eacute;e done with them.

And vpon a day when the <HI>knight</HI> of the Sun found himselfe alone with the princesse <HI>Lindabrides,</HI> amongst other matters which passed b&eacute;etw&eacute;ene them, hee sayde.</P>
<P>Lady and Princesse of the <HI>gran Tartaria,</HI> if I dyd thincke that my ouer much paine and inward griefe were perfectly knowen vnto you, then would not I at this present declare it, neyther the remedie for the same would I craue at your hands, for if you my Lady and Mistres, did vnderstand and know how grieuously I doo f&eacute;ele it, and in you to raigne a|ny good will to doo mee good, then would you of your proper good will procure to put remedy to the same without my as|king, for that I cannot beel&eacute;eue nor thinke that it is possible, that Nature hath formed a Damsell endued with so great beauty &amp; soueraigne grace, that it doth surmount all which at this present are borne, and should lacke in you pittie, the which is an extremitie amongst Damsels, for whereas any pittie doth dwell, they cannot bee without compassion, and hauing comassion to procure to put remedie in so sorrow|full a hart as mine is, which in euery houre and moment is in liuely flames burning and languishing in burning coales. The shining beames of your sight hath so kindled my thoughts, that they be all occupied in your seruice, and hath likewise scorched all my inward parts, and all my sences are blinde, my body all to peeces, and my soule as immortal alwaies. Therefore Lady I doo desire you, that although my paine is equall vnto that which they haue that are condem|ned to the pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ound lake, yet that in our remedies w&eacute;e <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> bee different that the mercy which doth lack for the~, let it be in you for to help mee, that I may b&eacute;e cleere fro~ so terrible a fire. And doo not delay any longer my remedy, for my griefe is so great, that it cannot suffer any delay because that ther|by I may b&eacute;e brought vnto such extremitie, that then you

would shew me this pleasure of remedy, then shall not I be able to receiue it at your hands.</P>
<P>And in concluding these words, the <HI>knight</HI> of the Sun with as great courage as euer he had, went vnto hir &amp; kissed hir on one of hir faire cheekes. Then the princesse, who very wel vnderstood the woords of the <HI>knght</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> &amp; his desire, al|though she was very glad &amp; ioyfull to see the great loue that he did beare hir, which was the thing that she did most desire, yet for all that she was so full of honesty, &amp; adorned with so great maiestie &amp; highnesse, that she was cleane contrary vn|to the purpose of the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> &amp; would rather con|sent to die, then to yeeld vnto any such thing, and so making some semblaunce as though she were angry, accompanied with great grauitie, she answered him and said.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> my very good &amp; perfect friend, I would neuer haue bel&eacute;eued that the true &amp; perfect loue which I haue borne vnto you, should haue ben recompe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ced w^t the like sin|glene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> &amp; puritie of loue, &amp; to haue proceeded from a pure &amp; perfect thought, for that of mine owne part I haue alwaies thought to be sure, &amp; in the great force &amp; strength of your person I had alwaies hope of defence against such like re|proch, at such time as I was most captiue and ouercome by loue, &amp; most kindled in the burning flames therof. I hoped in your soueraigne vertue to haue found defence for my imbe|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">: but now alasse, I find all to be contrary and cleane changed from my expectation. What, will you giue remedy vnto your sorrow and griefe, with that which will redound much to my barme? Will you first serue your owne turne &amp; accomplish your owne desire, without any consideration of my highnesse &amp; honestie, the which if you did beare good wil &amp; loue, as you doo publish, you would neuer procure so great harme vnto me, for it should be more griefe vnto th&eacute;e the sor|row that I shuld receiue, then thy own griefe: neither shuld you receiue any ioy in that, which shuld cause in me griefe. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> and <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> that I hau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> not my selfe

in so little estimation, that you should thinke that my loue were so base to cause such desires, nor the desires so mortall that should cause vnto you paine, but rather I doo think that things aboue nature doo cause ne paine vnto men, hauing want therof: So likewise my high &amp; royall estate accompa|nied with soueraigne beautie should b&eacute;e to you holden as a thing aboue nature, so by that meanes you should not haue the paine &amp; griefe which you publish, neither for to s&eacute;eke &amp; procure such vns&eacute;emely remedy, I will not inlarge any far|ther h&eacute;erein, for that I am angry, &amp; with anger ought little to be spoken, &amp; especially with friendes. It is sufficient good <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> that I doo loue you more then my selfe, and when time doth serue I will dooe that which loue &amp; reason doth bind me, that shall be at such time as we shall come vn|to the <HI>gran Tartaria,</HI> by the Emperour my father, &amp; all those mightie kings and lords of his court, with great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">, e|quall vnto your highnes, our marriage shall be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">, &amp; in the meane time haue patience &amp; bridle your owne <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> &amp; affections, &amp; doo not loose the glory of your great &amp; mightie d&eacute;eds, in being vanquished by your owne affection, for as the victory is greater that a man doth get of himselfe, so much greater is the victory when he doth ouercome his own will, for to that which reason doth deny, &amp; a greater shame when that by a base <HI>knight</HI> he is ouercome, for that the first is, for the lack which is of vertue and of the person, for so much as they did not lacke force &amp; strength for to make resistance, &amp; secondly, the lack was in nature, for that it gaue him no more strength for to defend himselfe.</Q></P>
<P>And h&eacute;erewith the princes made an end of hir reasoning, be|ing somwhat mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ed, hir redicond colour apeered, signifying that pure anger was the occasion therof.

At this time <HI>Ar|cadia,</HI> was not so farre of, but that shee did vnderstand part of their communication, for that at all times when she saw the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> &amp; the princes <HI>Lindabrides</HI> all alone, she straight waies procured to put hir selfe in place wheras she might heare what passed betw&eacute;ene them, &amp; hauing very well vnderstood what passed, it did grieue bir very much, for the great sorrow which the princesse <HI>Claridiana</HI> would receiue when she should vnderstand the truth therof, especially seeing it is a thing that may be held, for that according as she did vnderstand, that they two had great good will to be married at such time as they came vnto the <HI>gran Tartaria,</HI> and so dis|sembling hir griefe in the best wise she could, she tarried and did abide the time, that fortune would ordaine therein.</P>
<P>So at this time, b&eacute;eing thr&eacute;e daies after their departure towards the port wheras they did imbarke themselues, they did ariue at the port of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">enedon,</HI> hard by that place wher|as ther was wont to be the great Citie of <HI>Troy,</HI> where they went a land, &amp; by hir gyants were taken out of the ship of the triumphant chariot, &amp; placing themselues in order with soueraigne maiestie as before, they began to take their iour|ney by land, &amp; they had not well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">rauailed full two houres, when that they saw b&eacute;efore them, a very high and well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">owred Castle, scituated at the foote of a Bridge.

And as yet the Unicornes were scarce entered vppon the Bridge, when that there came foorth out of the Castle a <HI>Knight</HI> armed with very rich and substantiall armour, and mounted vppon a great horse, who was so great and so well made, that in all theyr lines they hadd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">

For that you shall vnderstand the ancient custome of this bridge, &amp; likewise the bondage wherin I am bound, for the defence &amp; keeping heere of, is, that I must show no curtesie to any <HI>knight</HI> that h&eacute;ere passeth. The <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> was very much troubled, as well at the good dispositio~ of <HI>Oristedes,</HI> as at his gentle speech and great courtesie: &amp; being very desirous to know more of him he said.

<P>But yet of courtesie I require you sir <HI>knight</HI> tell me what is the occasion that you doo call your selfe troyan, &amp; wherfore doo you k&eacute;epe &amp; defend the custome at this bridge.

So after the death of king <HI>Priamus</HI> &amp; all his sons, &amp; the destruction of the citie, ther remained certaine citizens of a base sort, such as y^e greekes made no account of, amongst whom it chanced the nurse who brought vp <HI>Pireo</HI> was one of them, who knowing whose son he was, did bring him vp with great care, till such time as he was a man, &amp; by nature he was enclined to the exercise of armes, so he gaue himself onely thervnto, &amp; had delight in no other thing, &amp; for that it was manifest vnto him whose sonne he was, for to sustaine some memory of the citie of <HI>Troy,</HI> &amp; of his father, he caused this bridge to be made, &amp; this castle, and ordained a custome that no <HI>knight</HI> might passe that way, but first to combatte with him &amp; to leaue h&eacute;erein his shield &amp; his name, saying that he was ouercome by him, &amp; in the time of his life he o|uercame so many <HI>knights,</HI> that they are without number, &amp; when he died hee left beehinde him a young sonne, and com|maunded that all those that did discend from him, should maintaine that custome, which of long time hath beene maintained at that bridge, so that all those which haue suc|ceeded in this Countrye from him vntill this time, hath maintayned &amp; kept that order &amp; custome, and hath ouer|come so great a number of <HI>knights,</HI> that in all that great

<P>The <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> reioyced very much at that which <HI>Oristedes</HI> had told him, &amp; did est&eacute;eme him little for that h&eacute;e came of that royall blood of <HI>Troy,</HI> &amp; s&eacute;emed vnto him accor|ding to his disposition, that he could not but be like in vali|antnes vnto his predecessours, &amp; giuing him great thankes for that which he had told him of his life &amp; custome, h&eacute;e sayd vnto him: Well gentle <HI>knight,</HI> s&eacute;eing it is so that you can|not choose but k&eacute;epe &amp; maintaine this your custome, neither I nor all these that dooe come with m&eacute;e cannot passe this bridge without making battaile, or els to returne agayne the way which we haue come.

<P>And then with as valiant a courage as appertayned vnto his progenie, he went &amp; put himselfe right against the <HI>knght</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> and both of them at one time did broach their hor|ses with their spurs, and with so great fury, that the bridge seemed to be ouerthorwen, &amp; both the <HI>Knights</HI> to be on fire, with the great quantitie of sparkes that came foorth of that paued pauement, and in the midst of the bridge they made their encounter in such sort, that their speares were sh&eacute;e ue|red all to p&eacute;eces, &amp; they passed the one by the other as though they had done nothing, and with a trise they turned about their horses with their swoords in their hands they assalted one another, &amp; the first blowes that were striken, it s&eacute;emed that all that valley was full of the sound thereof, b&eacute;eing st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">iken vppon their inchaunted healmes, whereas all those were executed, and beeing nothing amazed nor astonied therwith, but with great furye and wrath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ulnesse they did assalt each other with their sound blowes, and being meruailous<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ie ouercharged with the great force of them, it made them to decli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e their heads to their breasts, so that eyther of them did feele the great force of his a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">uersarye, and <HI>Oristedes</HI> said vnto himselfe, that neuer in all the daies of his life did h&eacute;e combat with a more valiaunter and worthyer Knight, but beeing determined to giue to vn|derstand his great force and strength, without any feare or dread, hee b&eacute;eganne to charge the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> with his terrible blowes, and with so great force and strength,

that he made him to bestur himselfe from the one part to the other, because that he should not fasten a full blow vpon him, &amp; this valiant <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> said vnto himselfe, that not without iust cause &amp; great reason the fame of that worthie <HI>Hector</HI> endured so long in the world, and now prouing that <HI>knight,</HI> who doth proceede of that anc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ent stock, he doth finde him, &amp; doo beleeue that ther is not a more valianter <HI>knight</HI> then he is to be found in all the world, &amp; seeing that it was necessary &amp; stood him vpon to vse against him all his power &amp; strength, he presently charged him with his mightie &amp; furi|ous blowes. So these two worthy <HI>knights</HI> endured in their battayle more then one houre without ceasing or taking any breath, but breaking their shields &amp; tearing of their shirts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">f maile that was so fine, sustaining the terrible blowes of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">th other, &amp; by reason of the great goodnes &amp; finenesse of theyr armour &amp; helmes, their furious swoords could not execute a|ny wound, yet for all that their flesh &amp; bones were all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">, and many times they brought each other out of all r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">mem|brance, &amp; seeing that their battaile endured very long, with|out acknowledging any aduantage betw&eacute;ene them.

<P>Oh valyaunt and famous Gr&eacute;ekes, such as were ioyned together at the siege of this great Citie of <HI>Troy,</HI> with how great reason, (aboue all things the which dooth happen in this world) ought you to b&eacute;e honoured and praysed, for that you dyd not alone resist the great force of the Sonnes of <HI>Priamus,</HI> but also you dyd destroy and ouerthrow all his generation, with all the whole power of the <HI>Troyans:</HI> Oh <HI>Achilles</HI> that Captayne of <HI>Greece,</HI> with what reason can I name my selfe and say, that I dooe proc&eacute;ede of the noble blood, fro~ whence my father the Emperour dooth descend for that it was not vnto th&eacute;e so much reproch the blows of that stout warrior, the first begotten of <HI>Priamus,</HI> as are vnto me the blows of this knight, who doth descend of his linage. And of truth I doo say, that if of this reproch I doo not reuenge my selfe, I doo pretend neuer h&eacute;erafter to name my selfe for a Breeke. And in saying these words the fury which h&eacute;e had was so great, that hee hasted with great sp&eacute;ede towards the valiaunt <HI>Oristedes,</HI> who b&eacute;eing not very well experien|ced with such lyke force, dyd abide his comming, and with both his hands h&eacute;e stroke him such an ouerthwart blow vpon his strong and inchaunted healme, that h&eacute;e made it to

And when that h&eacute;e had receiued aire, h&eacute;e came againe vnto him|selfe, and the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> tooke vp his helme, and gaue it vnto the knight, saying: Gentill knight take vnto you ar|mour, and doo not loose by their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ack, that which your great bounty doth assure you. Then <HI>Oristedes,</HI> when h&eacute;e saw the great curtesie of the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> h&eacute;e threw his sword vnto the ground, and sayd.

I am h&eacute;e that is ouercome, and he hath the victory that will not that our battell should proc&eacute;ede any further. And in saying these words the two knights did embrace one another.

countrie, and likewise in the <HI>gran Tartaria,</HI> and for that h&eacute;e was so great a friend vnto the Prince <HI>Meridian,</HI> he did not combat with him about his demaund, and if that <HI>Oristedes</HI> would haue remained and abode in the court of the Empe|rour <HI>Alicandro,</HI> hee would haue made him a mightie Lord, but vnderstanding the death of his father, and for to mayn|tayne that custome, h&eacute;e returned vnto <HI>Troy,</HI> whereas hard by the bridge there was a little Citie, to the number of two thousand households, and inhabited by the descent of such as remained at the destruction of the great citie of the <HI>Troians,</HI> and likewise vnto such <HI>Gieekes</HI> whom the countrie did like well. Now to returne vnto the purpose, then did the Prin|cesse receiue <HI>Oristedes</HI> with great loue, and said: Is it true my friend, will you thus intreate vs in your owne Coun|trie, w&eacute;e would not vse you in this sort in <HI>Tartaria,</HI> if we had you there. Soueraigne <HI>Princesse,</HI> said <HI>Oristedes</HI> may it please your highnesse to pardon &amp; forgiue m&eacute;e this errour, for that my dutie in the which I was bound by mine ancestours to maintaine this custome, as also lacke of knowing you, was the occasion that I haue committed this ouer-sight, and for that <HI>Oristedes</HI> dyd know of the demaund that the Prince <HI>Meridian</HI> did bringe out of his countrie, he demanded of the <HI>Princesse</HI> for him. And sh&eacute;e tolde him how that the <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> had battell with him, &amp; of all that passed betwixt them both. The which when <HI>Oristedes</HI> vnderstood, h&eacute;e dyd comfort himselfe very much, for that it s&eacute;emed vnto him to be no reproach, for to be ouercome by so valiant a knight, by whom <HI>Meridian</HI> was first ouercome, who thought that ther was not a knight in all the world that could match him. So receiuing great contentment for the acknowledge of the <HI>Princesse,</HI> as also to know that sh&eacute;e should b&eacute;e married to so valiant a knight, with great ioy &amp; plesure h&eacute;e said. For that which vnto so high a princesse as you are is due, I think it is no reson that in this sort alone you shuld enter into the <HI>gran Cataia,</HI> wheras are assembled y^e mightiest lords in the world, in the emperors court, therfore if you please I will go before,
<PB REF="232">
and carry them the newes of your comming, that they may receiue you, as your high estate dooth deserue, for that I am sure that the Emperour wil b&eacute;e as glad as euer h&eacute;e was in all his lyfe with the newes, and I shall receiue great con|tentment to finde my selfe present in the Court of the Em|perour <HI>Alycandro,</HI> at the celebrating of so high a marriage, and at the great triumphs &amp; feasts as shall b&eacute;e there made, as also for my bounden dutie, for the great good will which alwayes the Emperour bare vnto m&eacute;e. The <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> would very fayne haue disturbed the voyage of <HI>O|ristedes,</HI> for to haue excused the great trauayle which h&eacute;e should receiue in that iourney, for that it was very long, and needes must passe through very strange Countries, but h&eacute;e offered this with so great good will, that it did profit no|thing all that euer he could doo for to disturb him of his iour|ney. So for that day they all went vnto the Citie, whereas they were meruailously wel receiued, and were serued of al things very abundantly. Then the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne</HI> looke|ing out of a high window of the pallace, h&eacute;e saw p&eacute;eces of walls and towers of old antiquitie, which was a memorie of the great Citie of <HI>Troy,</HI> and round about the same the wide and broad fields, whose sight caused the teares to fall from his eyes, when hee remembred the great number of worthy knights, as wel <HI>Greeks</HI> as <HI>Troyans</HI> that were there slaine, and b&eacute;ehoulding the great circuite thereof, which dyd extend from the one side vnto the other foure miles, &amp; the smalnesse of the Citie at that present, and the great demon|stration of towers &amp; other mightie building, hee said within himselfe: Oh weake, miserable, and feeble life of man, what confidence or securitie canne mortall men haue in the great riches and pompe of this world, considering with great at|tention the sodaine &amp; vncertaine mouings &amp; changes of hu|mane things, &amp; how sodainly they are ouercome &amp; destroyed.

So she tooke hir leaue of them &amp; departed on hir tourney, &amp; they two remained in a monestary of religious men, which was foure miles from <HI>London</HI> in great confusion, not knowing how to determine themselues in these matters, that they stoode them so much vpon, seeing with what great hast they did prouide all things necessary for those triumphs &amp; feasts, &amp; the celebrating of y^e mariage of the princesse <HI>Oliuia,</HI> for that within foure daies the time would&punc; b&eacute;e expired of the two moneths which were appointed as it was told the~ of many that they ouertoke go|ing vnto the triumphs.

Who when she came vnto the citie of London, she went vnto the great pallas whereas she found not the princes, but it was told hir&punc; how that the king had commanded hir to be caried into a strong tower, wheras no bodie could neither see hir, nor speak with hir, but only two damsels, who did serue hir, &amp; without opening any doore, to any body all such things as was necessary for hir, was drawen vp at a window. This tower was scituated, vpon a high rock, very strong, &amp; nygh vnto a very broad &amp; d&eacute;epe riuer, &amp; walled round about. And the king kept the keies therof, for that he would that none should enter in therat for to visit the Princes, for that she seeing hir selfe so solitary, &amp; in so great straightnes, would be the occasion, that she would y&eacute;eld hir selfe vnto mariage, &amp; to doo all that the kings pleasure was to command hir, al|though it were all onely for to be cl&eacute;ere of so straight &amp; soli|tary life. So when <HI>Fidelia,</HI> came vnto the gates of the tower, &amp; saw that they were shut, she knocked at a ring that hong therat, till such time, as a damsell whom she did know very will, did looke out at a window: who when she knew <HI>Fidelia,</HI> being very much amazed to s&eacute;e hir, she said.

Then <HI>Ro|sicleer</HI> who was meruaylous attentiue vnto these words which the King <HI>Sacridoro</HI> had sayde: hauing his hart so va|liant and couragious for such like attempts, and likeing the counsaile of that inuention very well, b&eacute;efore that the King had fully ended his iudgement, when that h&eacute;e would haue put himselfe in that enterprise, and finding this to b&eacute;e the best remedy, they concluded, and straight wayes therewith they all thr&eacute;e departed to the sea side, which was not far of, and when they came thether they procured to seeke out and to prouide for to serue theyr turne a good Ship, and amongst a great number of strangers that were come the|they with people for to s&eacute;e theyr feasts, they chaunced to en|ter into one, which s&eacute;emed vnto them to b&eacute;e the strongest and the best sayler amongst them all.

And without any long tarying, hee ouerthrew o|ther ten <HI>knights</HI> of them, entreting them in such sort, that not one of them all could arise from the ground, of himselfe, but that they were caried in other mens armes, into their tents. At the which the king <HI>Oliuerio,</HI> &amp; all that were there present, were greatly amazed, and could not learne by any meanes to know who those two valiant <HI>knights</HI> should b&eacute;e.

<P>_AFter that <HI>Rosicleer</HI> and the King <HI>Sacridoro</HI> were departed out of the place whereas the iusts were made, they both put the~selues into a Forrest which ioyned nigh vnto the Citie, whereas they remayned till the night was come, b&eacute;eing fully determyned what they should doo, for that they had left their ship at the coast, all in a redinesse &amp; very wel appointed, &amp; considering in what great peril &amp; danger they did put themselues, they praied vnto god with all their harts for to deliuer the~ well out of that great reproch, &amp; hauing a very good hope y^t god wold aide &amp; succour them, for that which they went about was in a iust &amp; right cause, for to set fr&eacute;e the great wrong &amp; harme done vnto the Princesse.

All this time went <HI>Fidelia</HI> very diligently vp and downe the pallace, and when sh&eacute;e saw the houre draw n&eacute;ere that theyr pretence should be put in execution, she went out of the pal|lace, and taking with hir a bundle of things necessarie for the princesse, she went towards the sea side, and put hir selfe in the ship, abiding the time to s&eacute;e what fortune would doo for hir Lady and mistres, and for those worthy and valiant Knights, and was in so great feare, that for any thing sh&eacute;e would not b&eacute;e put in the like againe.

<P>_THe history saith that <HI>Oristedes</HI> the Troian, made so great sp&eacute;ed in his iourney towards the gran <HI>Cataia,</HI> wheras the emperour <HI>Ali|candro</HI> was, &amp; after that he had passed the first two <HI>Scithias,</HI> in the end of fiftie daies he entered into the third, which did belong vnto the Emperour <HI>Alicandro,</HI> &amp; the <HI>gran Cataia</HI> was in the confines of the third <HI>Scithia,</HI> which fallethmore towards the Orient, vnder the which was the mighty emperour of <HI>Tar|taria,</HI> the great, &amp; many other kingdomes, subiect vnto the em|perour <HI>Alicandro,</HI> wherby he was est&eacute;emed to be the migh|tiest lord in the world.

So when this good <HI>knight Oristedes</HI> was entred into the third <HI>Scithia,</HI> with|in one moonth after be entred into the <HI>gran Cataia,</HI> wher h&eacute;e vnderstood that the emperour was in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> citie called <HI>Neptaia,</HI> which had aboue an hundreth &amp; fiftie thousand householdes within the wals, &amp; when he came vnto the said citie, he went vnto the pallaice, &amp; entring in therat, he found the Empe|rour in the great hall, accompanied with many kings and Lords that were his subiects.</P>
<P><PB REF="252">And entring in therat he pulled of his helme, &amp; went &amp; kn&eacute;e|led downe before that mightye Emperour, for to kisse his hands: but he who knew him very well, &amp; very glad for to see him ther, made him to arise vp on his feet againe &amp; did embrace him saying, <HI>Oristedes,</HI> my very good friend, thy ab|sence hath not caused vnto me so much sorow &amp; grie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e, as now t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">y comming doth cause me to be glad and ioyfull.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Oristedes</HI> said, my good lord &amp; emperour you shall re|ceiue much more contentment, when that you dooe vnder|stand the newes that I dooe bring vnto you, for that you shall vnderstand that the princes <HI>Lindabrides,</HI> your daughter is comming, &amp; very nigh vnto this country: &amp; doth bring in hir company a <HI>knight,</HI> the most valiant est that euer the gods did create in all the world, and hauing the prince <HI>Meridian,</HI> your son, trauailed throughout many countries, till he came vnto the emp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">re of <HI>Grecia,</HI> &amp; neuer could find any one <HI>knight,</HI> that in bounty &amp; force, was equall vnto him. But this alone <HI>knight,</HI> who did ouercome me in equall battaile, &amp; since h&eacute;e hath defended the beauty of the Princes <HI>Lindabrides,</HI> with the best <HI>knights</HI> that is in the world. And when he came vn|to <HI>Troy,</HI> whereas I doo dwell, defending the passage of the bridge, kept by old antiquitie, hauing battaile with him, hee ouercame me. And at his co~mandement I am come hether, for to bring you newes of their comming. And for that you shall s&eacute;e &amp; vnderstand, how fauourably the gods hath b&eacute;ene vnto the princes, in giuing vnto hir so valiant a <HI>knight,</HI> you shall vnderstand, that if hee dooe exc&eacute;ede in bounty, of <HI>knight|hood,</HI> there is no lacke in him of maiestie and high estate, for that hee is sonne vnto the Emperour of <HI>Grecia,</HI> b&eacute;eing accounted the mightyest Prince, that is amongest all the Christiane.</P>
<P>So when the Emperour <HI>Alicandro</HI> hadde well vnder|stoode all that <HI>Oristedes,</HI> hadde tolde him, h&eacute;e was so full of ioy and mirth, that h&eacute;e thought that in all his life he neuer receiued the one halfe of so great comfort &amp; pleasure,
<PB N="243" REF="252">
for that he louod the princes <HI>Lindabrides,</HI> much more then the prince <HI>Meridian.</HI> And would giue a good part of his estate, so that the Princesse might remaine with the whole Empire. And for that he was fully certified of the high bounty, of <HI>O|ristedes,</HI> &amp; of the prince <HI>Meridian,</HI> his sonne. That he was cer|taine &amp; suer, that the <HI>knight</HI> that should ouercome them, in battaile, should surmount all other <HI>knights</HI> in the whole world. And so with great ioy, he did embrace <HI>Oristedes,</HI> &amp; gaue him great thanks for his comming. All the other lords and <HI>knights</HI> that were in the great hall, they were greatly ama|zed when they vnderstoode that one alone <HI>knight</HI> did ouer|come in battaile two such valiant <HI>knights</HI> as they were. For that they thought verily that in all the world could not b&eacute;e found others that could be equall vnto them. So strayght waies the Emperour <HI>Alicandro,</HI> caused these newes to b&eacute;e published throughout all his kingdome &amp; lordship, comman|ding all his v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ssailes &amp; subiects, to prepare &amp; make themselues in a redines, to be at the great triumphs &amp; feasts which h&eacute;e doth pretend to make, at the mariage of the princes <HI>Lindabri|des,</HI> his daughter. All this while the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> went tranailing in his triumphant chariot, &amp; the more that y^e con|uersation of the princes did continue, so much the more, dyd his hart burne in the flaming fier of hir loue, in such sort, y^t he neuer remembred the faire princes <HI>Claridiana,</HI> neither the em<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">erour his father, nor <HI>Rosicleer,</HI> his brother, neither his two perfect friends <HI>Brandizel</HI> &amp; <HI>Clauerindo,</HI> of all his memory he was cleane void, forgetting his owne naturall country, &amp; all transported &amp; kindled in the amorous loue of the princes, and onely in contemplating himselfe in beholding hir great beautie, was all his ioy &amp; delight, so that he remembred no other thing. Wherat none ought much to meruaile, for that the surpassing beautye of this noble princes, (accompanyed with so high and soueraigne maiestie) was such, that I doo beleeue that there was neuer <HI>knight</HI> borne in this world, that k&eacute;eping continuall company with hir as the <HI>knight</HI> of

So that if the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> with the presence of the princesse had forgot himselfe, to the con|trary, the princes with the presence of him was the pleasant|est lady in all the world, &amp; receiued great contentment one|ly in thinking that at their comming vnto the court of the emperour hir father, their marriage should straight wayes be celebrated.

So the Emperor (although very much against his will, and by theyr great importunancie) did grant leaue vnto them. So these two perfect friends departed from <HI>Constantino|ple,</HI> and when they came vnto the waters side, they entered into a ship which they found readie to depart towards the kingdome of <HI>Polonia.</HI> After that they were departed &amp; had sayled on theyr voyage foure dayes, there beegan to arise a great storme at the sea, and at midnight the winde began to blow so terrible, and the Sea to worke so far out of all or|der, that sometimes they thought that the waues carryed the ship vp into the cloudes, and other tymes they thought the Ship to fall downe to the deapth thereof, and the Ship receiued such a leake, that whatsoeuer the marriners could doo with the Pompe and otherwise, yet might they goe vp to the knees in water aboue the balest, for the which cause these two good knights made no other reckoning but to b&eacute;e lost, which caused them with all theyr harts to praye vn|to God to haue mercie on them, and to forgiue them theyr sinnes, and also if it were his diuine pleasure to delyuer them out of that great torment.

for that if he had not s&eacute;ene it, he could not haue bel&eacute;eued that the power os any one Lord in all the world could not haue extended so far.

The~ straight waies after him came foorth <HI>Bracazar,</HI> king of the <HI>Sandalos,</HI> with a crowne of gold vpon his helme, which did signifie him to be a king, who was very proud, and a <HI>knight</HI> very much feared amongst the pagans, &amp; comming against the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> they made their encounters in such sort, that when the pride of <HI>Bracazar</HI> did mast increase, he found himselfe o|uerthrowen vnto the ground, vnto his great reproch, &amp; the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> without any moouing, &amp; with great furie of his horse, did passe forwardes on without receiuing any harme. So straight waies ther came foorth another pagan, vnto the encounter called, <HI>Gebreo,</HI> king of the <HI>Teras,</HI> one of the principalest in all y^e court of the emperour, who thought at the first encounter, to ouer throw the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> &amp; with great fury went against him, &amp; strok him, such a blow with his speare, that he made him somwhat to decline back|wards vpon his saddle. But the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> made his encounter with so great strength, that he ouer threw him &amp; his horse vnto the ground. Then without any further tary|ing, ther came foor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">h other three strong and valiant pagans, whom he ouerthrew at their first encounters, to the ground, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> so great wonder vnto the emperour, &amp; vnto all those that did b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">hold him&punc; that they could not bel&eacute;eue that in any humane <HI>knight,</HI> should remaine so great force, or the like were able for to doo.

and strengthe, for that comming bether &amp; to be lord ouer all these thy countries kingdomes &amp; ioueraigne Emperour, to be equall with them.

And I so glad for to receiue him to be my son, that ther is no other ioy, that I doo d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">sire nor looke for. So whilest that the emperour, &amp; the Troian <HI>Onste|des,</HI> was talking haereof, there entered into the great place, twelue giants, all together of so huge bignes, that they see|med to be towers, &amp; all mounted vpon mighty elephants, &amp; armed with armour made of scalles &amp; bones, bordered with with fine gold &amp; precious stones, with crownes of siluer ve|ry curiously wrought, vpon their helmes, &amp; their elophants were couered with skins, &amp; lined with very fine white <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">, which did become them very well. And ther entred in after them twelue dwarffes, of the Pigmeres, which were their pages, and all mounted vpon Elophants, who carried theyr speares &amp; shields, which were of so great hugenes, that they were all together hid vnder them, that no part of them could be perseued, in such sort, that beholding the mightie hugenes of the one, &amp; the small stature of the other, might very well be considered the great contrarietie that is in the operati|on of nature. Then so soone as they were entred in, the em|perour straight waies sent word to know what they were &amp; it was giuen to vnderstand, that they were the kings of the orientall Ilands, which were very many &amp; very aboun|dant, full of gold &amp; siluer &amp; precious stones, &amp; wheras all the whole nation, as well women as men, were giants. Although not far from them was the country of pigmeres: &amp; for that these kings did vnderstand of these great feasts &amp; triumphs, they were agreed altogether to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> &amp; see them, ech of them beleeuing&punc; that twenty of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 words"> that might be ioy|ned
<PB N="252" REF="261">
together, were not able to equall themselues vnto his great force &amp; strengeth. And to say the truth, they were the greatest &amp; valiantest in all the world, for that they were of the naturall generation of giants, for others ther be abroad in countries, that although they s&eacute;eme to be as big as they be, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">et are they not of the nation that they be of.</P>
<P>When these twelue G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ants were entred into the great &amp; mightie place, all the whole company wondered greatly, for they were the greatest that euer they had s&eacute;ene, and beeing mounted vpon these Elophants, they s&eacute;emed an vnusuall thing to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ust with, &amp; no <HI>knight</HI> would iust with them, for that twentie <HI>knights</HI> together were not sufficient once to mooue them. So straight waies one of them put himselfe right a|gainst the <HI>knight</HI> of the Sun, with a speare in his hand, of so huge bignes, that it s&eacute;emed to be the mast of a ship, who sha|ked it with such vnusuall force of his arme, that all men mused at it, &amp; seeing him so great &amp; fearefull, ther were few in all that place but were very sorry to s&eacute;e him put himself against the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> but especially the Emperour <HI>Alicandro,</HI> and much more the princesse his daughter, who could not abide to s&eacute;e hir <HI>knight</HI> put in that great perill, but sodai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ly lost hir coulour &amp; fell in a sound in the armes of hir ladies &amp; damsels, who had very much to do before they could bring hir againe vnto hir selfe. But this worthy &amp; couragi|ous <HI>knight,</HI> who made no wonder at the hugenes of the Gi|an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> but choosing the greatest and strongest speare that was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> a great number that were ther, and setting spurs vnto his swift horse and with so great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ury, that it seemed like a whirle winde, he went towardes that mightie Gy|ant, who so fast as the Elophant could runne, came against him&punc; and ioyning together in the middest of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">, the speares point of the Giant did pearce through the shield of the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> and by reason that his armour w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s the finest and the strongest that was in all the world,
<PB REF="262">
the speare could not pearce it, but glanced on the one side, so that the speare apeered at the back of the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> with his shield vpon the point, for that the buckles thereof were broken, and vpon a sodaine in that place was there a g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">eat rumor, &amp; shriks amongst the people, thinking that he had ben slaine, but the val<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ant <HI>knight</HI> who had not his equall in all the world, determined ther to shew his bountye, made his enter in such sort vpon the broad breast of that dreadfull Giant, by reason that the speare was great &amp; strong, &amp; b&eacute;e|fore it did breake he ouerthrew him &amp; his Elephant to the ground, whose fall made so great a noise, as though a whole tower had fallen downe, &amp; he proc&eacute;eded forwards on his fu|rious course as though he had receiued no encounter at all, which made all those that were present to wonder at that mightie blow. Then the valiant <HI>Oristedes</HI> said vnto the em|perour: I doo bel&eacute;eue that if the ancestors of this <HI>knight,</HI> the gr&eacute;ekes, and mine of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">roians, which were together at the siege of <HI>Troy,</HI> were now aliue, not one of them should get a|ny honour by this <HI>knight,</HI> neither could they doo such mer|uailes in <HI>knighthood,</HI> for that if this we haue s&eacute;ene, should be related vnto vs in histories, are giuen vs to vnderstand by others, the most part therof we neuer should nor could, bee leeue, but rather iudge it to be a thing impossible. Of a truth said the emperour, your troian ancestors were very good &amp; singuler <HI>knights,</HI> but yet I dooe bel&eacute;eue that this <HI>knight</HI> is better then euer they were, &amp; being in this co~munication, the second giant came foorth to iust with the knight of the <HI>Sun,</HI> who taking another shield, as fast as his horse could run mo|ued against him, &amp; so mightely they made their encounter, that the speare of the giant, by reason that it was big, and chanced a full blow on the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> y^t it made him to decline backewards somewhat, &amp; brake not, but glanced vp|wards without dooing any other harme, so that hee setteled himselfe, but he made his encounter with the Gyaunt so strongly, that vnhorsing him from his Elephant, he threw
<PB N="253" REF="262">
him to the ground, and the good Knight passed forwards, leauing the giant with so great anger, that the smoke c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">me out at his beauer, as from a chimney with fire. Then straight waies came foorth the third Gyant, whom this va|lyaunt knight dyd ouerthrow vnto the ground&punc; in the same order as hee dyd the other&punc; in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">uch sort hee perseuered in his valiaunt bounty, that the first part of the day lacked to con|clude, when that of the twelue giants, hee had ouerthrowe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> a leauen of them to ground, without once moouing in his Saddle at the encounter of any of them, putting so great wonder in all them which beeheld him, that seeing it beefore their eies, they thought it a thing impossible to bee b&eacute;eleeued. And the faire Princesse <HI>Lindabrides</HI> seeing hir knight cl&eacute;ere from so mightie encounters, was no lesse ioyfull, as to s&eacute;e him so far absent from the presence of the fayre Princesse <HI>Claridiana,</HI> although sh&eacute;e was not in full securitie in s&eacute;eing the last Gyaunt which remayned, who s&eacute;emed vnto hir to b&eacute;e the best and most wonderfull, and so it was of truth, for that this was the most brauest &amp; strongest of them all, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">d although they were all Kings, euery one of them ouer his Iland, yet by reason of his great brauenesse and mightie force, they were all subiect vnto this, and they est&eacute;emed him for theyr Lord and principall amongst them, and in signe and token thereof, this had his crowne of fine golde mer|uailous richly wrought with precious stones, and the other were all of siluer, and hee was called <HI>Bradaman Campeon,</HI> which was as much to say in theyr language, mighty king, Captayne, or Champyon, and was Lord ouer the Iland <HI>Serpentaria,</HI> which is the most biggest and principallest a|mongst all the Orientall Ilands. The wise <HI>Artemidoro</HI> sayth, that this was h&eacute;e that dyd compile the mightie d&eacute;edes of he <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> in those parts whereas this <HI>Bradaman</HI> dwelt, was the most mightiest and valyauntest Gyaunt that euer was seene, and hee who had most power ouer all the Gyaunts of the Orient all Ilands, for that by reason of the great fiercenesse of that nation, there was ne|uer any that had so much power as to bring them into

<P>Sir Knight, thou oughtest to haue thy selfe in great e|stimation, for that thou hast with so great lightnesse ouer|throwen my companions, which are the most strongest Gy|ants in all my Kingdomes, and for that thou shalt not de|ceiue thy selfe of thy victorie, the which thou hast got of them, neyther thy bountie to make th&eacute;e so hardie for to en|ter with m&eacute;e alone into contention, I will giue th&eacute;e to vn|derstand that I am <HI>Bradaman Campeon,</HI> Lord ouer the Ori|entall <HI>Ilands,</HI> h&eacute;e that if all the Knights in the world were ioyned together in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> agaynst him, h&eacute;e dooth thinke to put them vnto the sword first, beefore they should ouercome him by armes.

<P>The great brauerie of the Gyant for all that, dyd not put

any feare into this worthy knight, although he s&eacute;emed vnto him, to be one of the most deformedst of stature that euer he saw in all his life: yet his valyant courage was such, that with the help of god, he hoped to abate his pride, &amp; with that confidence he answered &amp; said: I do giue th&eacute;e great thanks <HI>Bramadan,</HI> for this tale which y^u hast tolde vnto mee although (for to giue occasion to haue th&eacute;e in greater estimation) it had been better, that an other had giuen mee to vnderstand of thy great fame, and not told me by thy selfe.

In the meane time this valiaunt knight, did strike him such a blow vpon his leg, that what with the great strength wherewith it was stroken, and the finenesse of his swoord, it cut his armour and the flesh vnto the hard bone, whereat issued ve|ry much blood, that the earth was all to b&eacute;e sprinkled there|with.

And so with this dreadfull semblance, he went agaynst the <HI>knight</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> b&eacute;eing very certayne and sure, that if any of those pellets, should fasten vpon him, that it would breake him all to p&eacute;e|ces.

The which when the good Knight saw, beeing very glad, h&eacute;e cleered him|selfe from him, and said: I promise thee from this time for|wards, thou shalt not profit thy selfe any more of this thy dreadfull weapon against mee.
