<HEAD>The Epitaphe of the honorable Earle of Penbroke, Baron of Cardiffe, and Knight of the most Noble order of the garter. Who dyed Lord stueward of the Qu&eacute;enes maiesties houshold, and of her priuie counsell.</HEAD>
<L>_SInce playnts want power to perce the skyes, or rayes the dead from graue,</L>
<L>No teares nor sighes may well suffies, to wayle the losse we haue.</L>
<L>Then lordings wype your blobbred eyen, and sobb no more alas:</L>
<L>For death and deastnye doth assigne, all lyfe lyke shade shall passe.</L>
<L>No seat nor Scepture certayne is, the hye and lowe a lyke:</L>
<L>In spight of pompe and worldly blis, fall both amid the dyke.</L>
<L>But when a propp that stayde the state, dropps downe as you do see:</L>
<L>The lokers on in muse do stand, at crack of such a tree.</L>
<L>which leaues the world in moorning weeds, behynd to weepe the losse,</L>
<L>(Whyles frute is fled from brantch and bowe, as gold forsakes the drosse)</L>
<L>O <HI>Penbroke</HI> wilt thou part so sone, what hast hath hyed thee hence:</L>
<L>Had I byn warnd I had perfuemd, thy Tombe with frankinsence.</L>
<L>But cald so swiftly to my pen, the sweete insence I want:</L>
<L>yet sweare I by the sacred Gods, though skill and sence be skant.</L>
<L>Thou shalt not hyde in clotts of claye, thy ritch rare gyftes of kynd,</L>
<L>Nor skrawlling wormes shall make no praye, apon thy noble mind.</L>
<L>The Court that knew thy constant hart, bydds thee returne againe,</L>
<L>That art for troth and freendshipp fast, a parfect pattern plaine.</L>
<L>A father where the counsell sate of tongue and talke deuine,</L>
<L>As he at byrth had stolne the grace, of all the Musis nine.</L>
<L>His lookes dyd speake when silent lipps, lockt vp great thinges in head,</L>
<L>yea eu'ry word past <HI>Penbrokes</HI> mouth, peysd well a pound of lead.</L>
<L>No lightnes lodged in his browes, and sure a man in deede,</L>
<L>That well might ryes from <HI>Troyians</HI> race, and honour <HI>Hectors</HI> seede.</L>
<L>Of nature noble voyd of blott, in Court and countrey throwe:</L>
<L>As curteys as the lyttell Lambe, or Faucon gentyll nowe.</L>
<L>In bountie dyd his harte abound, where cause made place before:</L>
<L>Not wonne by feare, but held by loue, what might be wished more.</L>
<L>To such as fau'red learnings lore, (though he no schole poynt knew)</L>
<L>His pursse and hand as closly crept, as hauke weare clapt in mew.</L>
<L>To those that seemd somwhat to be, whose harts he sawe aspier:</L>
<L>He gaue good hope in signe of happ, to further there desier.</L>
<L>To Prince and countrey true as steell, no blast could beare him downe,</L>
<L>He kept his promise fayth and oth, in Court, in feeld and towne.</L>
<L>Deuout to God his lyfe well showes, his death doth that declare,</L>
<L>On Christ alone, the corner stone, he onely layd his care.</L>
<L>O manly <HI>Penbroke</HI> yet me thinks, I see thee martch vpright,</L>
<L>Thy iesture and thy iolly port, stands still before my sight.</L>
<L>Thy cleanly finenes trimly framd, sprang out of noble brest:</L>
<L>And all thou didst within thy dayes, a noble mind exprest.</L>
<L>But nothing here so cleane or gay, can kepe the lyfe alyue,</L>
<L>Both wealth and Lordshipp leapes away, when death our date doth dryue.</L>
<L>yet death when he hath done his worst, dare not molest the spreete:</L>
<L>That God doth clayme and angels thinke, for Abrams bosome meete.</L>
