<P>_COnsidering the many Lear|ned and judicious Tracts, that are extant against A|theism, Infidelity, Popery, with other Heresies, Sects, &amp; Schisms, destructive of the Antient Catho|lick Religion, and of that Peace and Vnity, Love and Charity, which is the badge and mark of Christs sheep; I thought it superfluous to add my poor Scrible after such fair Copy's, but ob|serving the length, and learning of those elaborate Tractat's, which ma|ny men have neither money to buy, leasure to read, nor judgment to un|derstand, I conceived that these few short Discourses, (not fitted, nor in|deed intended, for the perusal of the learned) might nevertheless, be <HI>gra|tum opus agricolis,</HI> not altogether un|profitable for men of ordinary Capaci|tyes,
<PB REF="3">
to which purpose I have used such means and methods. That I might be the better understood by these men, I have endeavoured that the mat|ter of these discourses (for the most part) might be plain and familiar, the phrase and expressions intelligible. I have made use of two feigned names. (<HI>Firmianus</HI> and <HI>Dubitantius,</HI>) to per|sonate the sound Believer, and the doubting Sceptick Christian, who are brought upon the Stage, disputing by way of Dialogue, which is most suite|able to men of short discourse, and most apt to comply with their apprehension. I hope the more learned Reader, (if any such shall give themselves the trouble to peruse this little Manuel) will not Censure the plainness of it, but rather commend the Charity of the Author to|ward the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll meaning Christian, who amongst those many Treatises, that have been written, can meet with very
<PB REF="3">
few that are calculated for his Meri|dian, and consequently is apt <HI>to be blown about with every wind of do|ctrine, by the slight of men, and cun|ning craftines whereby they lye in wait to deceive</HI>&punc; and who these game|sters are, he that has but half an eye may see, and how many a poor soul has in these times of confusion been blown about from one erroneous opini|on to another, until he has turned <HI>Seek|er, Scheptick,</HI> and at last down right <HI>Atheist,</HI> there is no man so great a stranger in our <HI>Hierusalem</HI> that can be ignorant.</P>
<P>Wherefore if these short and fami|liar discourses may have the happiness to prevent the falling of any unsetled, wavering soul, or to restore any that has fallen to a sound mind, 'twill be my great satisfaction and rejoying to be a|ble to apply to my self that of <HI>St. James, cap.</HI> 5.19. <HI>Brethren if any of you do
<PB REF="4">
err from the truth and one convert him, let him know that he that converts a sinner from the error of his way, shall save a soul from death, and shall cover a multitude of sins.</HI> Now the God of truth and peace grant, that these poor and weak endeavours may work that good effect upon the erring seduced sinner, and that the multitude of my sins may be covered, with the long white robe of my blessed Saviours righteousness, for his holy name sake. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<P>GOod morrow to my old Friend <HI>Dubitantius.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>A good day to you, <HI>Firmianus.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Methinks I read some discontent in your face: what may be the cause of it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is a great cause; I have been so long distracted betwixt diversity of Opinions in point of Religion, that I am now doubting whe|ther there be any Religion at all, or any Supream invisible Deity to be worshipped.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is the common result of vain Jang|lings, that they usually end in Atheism and Infi|delity. But pray tell me, is it possible, that there should be such fierce disputes, and bitter conten|tions about a very nothing? Certainly such sharp disputes about the various manners of Gods wor|ship, do strongly argue that Religion is a thing of
<PB N="2" REF="5">
highest concern, or that all the wisest men that e|ver were in the world are Fooles, and madmen, to oppose, hate, malign, persecute one another even unto death, for a groundless fancy, a very nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your discourse is very Rational, for I suppose wise men would never wrangle about a meer Romance; yet I confess I have had strange irrational thoughts, against the very Being of God, and the truth of any Religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>You justly term such thoughts irratio|nal. Did not I once tell you, that when you had fors<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ken your Mother the Church of England, (the most Apostolical Catholick in the whole world) in short time you would become a Liber|tine, an Atheist, any thing, or nothing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you think that all Nonconfor|mists, and Separatists from your Church, are Libertines and Atheists?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not so uncharitable: but I must tell you, that causeless separation is a very greive|ous sin, and punished many times with the seve|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">est judgments, such as are Spiritual blindness, Hardness of heart, and a Reprobate mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fear those judgments have overtaken me: for since I became a Separatist from your Church, I have been very cold at my Devotion, made little conscience of publick, or secret Praier; of Obedience to those powers which God has or|dained; of Love, Charity, Honesty, and Upright dealing towards my neighbours. I have lived an Atheist in practise so long, that I am now ready to
<PB N="3" REF="5">
be an Atheist in Opinion, and to say with the foole in the 14. <HI>Psal. There is no God.</HI> I have so long s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ept out of one opinion into another, that at length I am become a very Sceptick in Religion, doubting of all, and fixing upon none.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly Sir, you made good your name by your practise, which renders you a right <HI>Dubi|tantius.</HI> But pray tell me by what degrees, and me|thods, you have stept out of our Church into the borders of Atheism, that I may with the more facility bring you back the same way, by which you have unhappily gone out from us, into the bosome of your dear Mother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Demand is reasonable. 'Tis not unknown to you that I was once a true son of the Church of England, you shall hereafter know for what reasons I left her Communion, and became a Presbyterian: and to be breif I stay'd not long, in that opinion, but presently I proceeded Indepen|dent, then Anabaptist, then Quaker, then Papist, then Antiscripturist, then what you now find me, almost an Atheist.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope you are not fixed in that wretch|ed Opinion, as resolvedly to deny him a being, that gave you yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I am not; but have many doubts whether there be, and as many thoughts that there is not a God, Creator and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">overnour of Heaven and Earth, and all things in them cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ined.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heretofore taken you for a ratio|nal man, and therefore I desire a reason from you
<PB N="4" REF="6">
of such thoughts and doubts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Those many Controversies, and sharp contentions about religion and worship of God, have caused me to doubt, whether there be any Religion at all, or any God to be worshipped.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it imaginable that so many wise men should contend about a trifle, a fancy, a very nothing? 'Tis strange that what should be a most rational motive to perswade you to beleive that there is a God, and a Religion, should make you doubt of both. There must be something in it, that draws so many Combatants into the field, Zea|lous Sticklers for their several Modes, and Formes, of Religion, hateing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne another even unto death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>This you have intimated before. I am fully convinced, that so many fierce disputes about Religion, do argue, that tis not a meer fancy. I pray Sir, enquire no further after the rea|sons of my doubts, but let me hear from you, how they may be satisfied.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most willingly; but that we may pro|ceed the more methodically, let it be agreed be|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wixt us, what is the true notion of God. Upon supposition that God is, what do you conceive of him in your mind?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis agreed by all, that the notion or conception of God in our mind, is, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Moors</HI> Antidote, and Dr. <HI>Stillings<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eets</HI> Orig. Sacrae p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g. 395.</NOTE> that he is a being infinitely perfect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="6">
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>If God be a being infinitely perfect&punc; then God is: for a being infinitely perfect must necessarily exist and be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not we say, a Rose is a flower, yet it does not follow (at a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l times) that a Rose is: for in the winter there is no such thing as a Rose, and yet the proposition is true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is a vast difference betwixt a being absolutely perfect, and that which has a li|mited and finite perfection; for in this the essence may be really abstracted from the actual existence, but not in that. For a being infinitely or absolutely perfect, must necessarily exist; not contingently, or impossibly; for those modes are inconsistent with a being absolutely perfect; for whatsoever does exist contingently, is in possibility not to exist, which is an imperfection: and impossibility of existence is the greatest imperfection of all other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>This reason is so obscure, that albeit I cannot reply to it, yet I am not satisfied with it. I fear some fallacy lies hid in the bowels of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe not; yet because you do not fully comprehend it, I shall proceed to others tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> are more plain and intelligible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>What say you then to that reason which is drawn from the General consent of all nations, as well Heathens as Christians; <HI>Nulla gens tam barbara,</HI> &amp;c. saies <HI>Cicero</HI>; No nation was ever so barbarous which did not confess a God; now the consent of all nations is the law and dictate of nature, so that tis impossible that all nations should
<PB N="6" REF="7">
consent in so great a falshood, as the Atheist en|deavours to maintain.</P>
<P>Add to this their general practise in worship|ing some supream Deity; that rather then worship no God at all, they would worship the Sun, Moon and Stars, ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t contemptible Creatures, the Crocodile, Onyons, Garlick, a Red Cloath, any thing they first met with in the morning; so powerful is the impulse and inclination of na|ture in this great business of Religion, which is the proper distinguis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing Character betwixt a man and a beast: as <HI>Lactantius</HI> has long since ob|served.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess that the general consent of na|tions in the acknowledging and worshiping a God, has been one main reason, that has kept me from being a down-right Atheist: Yet I have som|what to say against it; because this consent is not so general as is pretended, for I have heard there have been men in Antient times, and not a few in these we live in, who have said, not only in <HI>their hearts,</HI> but also with their tongues, <HI>there is no God.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are two, or three men in former ages, or a fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> debauched persons in this, to the general consent of all civil nations, from the be|ginning of the world? Happily you have heard that so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e have denied, the Sno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to be white, the Fire to be hot. Monstrous opinions are no more a pre|judice to the dictates of nature, and common con|sent of all nations, then monstrous shapes and formes in the body are to the laws of nature, which

she generally observes, in the forming of men and beasts in their due proportions, and lineaments&punc; What if some few, out of discontent, singularity, a|nimosity, or brutish sensuality, have turned Athe|ists? Is it not a great prejudice to this brutish o|pinion, That few Sober men (if any) have been of their party, but such as have been first Atheists in practise, sensual, debauched wretches? <HI>Nam quo quis in vita purior, &amp;c.</HI> saies <HI>Cicero</HI>: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y how much any man has been more pure in his li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e and conversation, by so much his thoughts of the Gods have been more sound and rational.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess it is a great prejudice to Athe|ism, that the Debaucher sort are the greatest (i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> not the only) sticklers for it; but still my doubt remains, and therefore I desire to hear from you some more evident reasons, for my full satis|faction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most willingly I shall comply with you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> desire. My Third Argument shall be this.</P>
<P>If the world had a beginning, and was not from all eternity, then 'twas made by somthing else; for nothing can make it self. 'Tis as clear as the Sun at noon day, whatsoever is made, is made by ano|ther; for that which is not, cannot work, and conse|quently cannot produce it self, nor a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing: now this somthing else must be made o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> some other cause, or else it self must be the su|pream cause of all things. If you affirm the for|mer, you must run up into an infini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e number of Causes, which is impossible, or else you must come at last to one supream independent being, which is
<PB N="8" REF="8">
the maker of all things, he himself being made of none, which is the eternal God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>I begin to feel the weight of this Argu|ment. If you can clearly prove the world to have had a beginning, I shall be your Convert, and readily confess, that verily there is a God that hath made the world, and judgeth the earth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>This I hope I shall perform by his gra|cious assistance, whose cause I plead, and whose poor sinful creature I am.</P>
<P>First, Then by the world we understand the whole Systeme, or Collection of things in it con|tained, Sun, Moon, Stars, Air, Earth, Water, Men, Beasts, Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">les, Fishes, Plants, and all things whatsoever comprehended in this vast circumfe|rence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>I willingly grant that by t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> World we are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o understand all things therein contained, as you have enumerated them, which make up the visible world, created by Almighty God, in six daies, as your <HI>Moses</HI> would have us believe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>That none of these were from all eter|nity, I shall prove by instancing in two of the most principal of them, to wit, the Sun in the Fir|mament, and Man that dwells upon the face of the earth, by which you may judge of the rest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you can prove that the Sun was not from eternity, and that there was a first Man, and consequently that mankind had a beginning, I shall be abundantly satisfied, it that wherein at present
<PB N="9" REF="8">
I much doubt, <HI>viz.</HI> The worlds beginning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Before I proceed to my arguments, you must give me leave, to lay down certain princi|ples which no rational man will deny; As for example.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Quicquid fit, fit ab alio,</HI> whatsoever is made, is made by somthing else; for nothing can make it self.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Omne ens est vel factum, fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itum, depen|dens, vel non factum, infinitum, independens</HI>; every thing that is, is either made, finite, independent; or not made, infinite, independent.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Vere i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">finitum non habet principium, aut fi|nem</HI>; that which is truly infinite, has neither beginning, not end.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Non datur pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">essus in infinitum</HI>; we cannot pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eed in numbering, from effects to causes, or in any other way imaginable infinitely, but we must come <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o some period o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> end.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Infinitum no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> potest pertransiri,</HI> 'tis impossi|ble to pass over or through that which is infinite, so as to come to an end of it, seeing what is infinite has no end.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Infinito <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">il potest addi,</HI> to that which is infi|ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e nothing can be added to make it greater, or more then 'twas before that addition.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Aeternitas est duratio <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nterminabilis sine partium successione, in qua non datur prius &amp; poste|rius</HI>; Eternity in its full and proper notion, is a boundless duration, without beginning or end, without succession of parts, as that one part of it should be either before or after another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>No rational man can deny any of these principles: but I much wonder, how so great a master of reason, as <HI>Aristotle</HI> was, should grant all or most of these, and hold the eternity of the world, and not be sensible of manifest contradi|ctions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>That the Eternity of the world is a flat contradiction to many of these principles, is evident; that <HI>Aristotle</HI> was an acu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Philosopher, cannot be denied; but it must be granted he was but a man, and one that had only the light of cor|rupted nature to guide him, he might therefore err, <HI>not knowing the Scripture, nor indeed the pow|er of God,</HI> and therefore he w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s ignorant how the world could have a beginning; and seeing he ve|ry resolutely maintained, that <HI>ex nihilo ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">il fit,</HI> that whatsoever is made, is made of somthing, and that of somthing else, and so we mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> proceed <HI>in infi|nitum,</HI> which he positively denied as absurd and impossible, as well he might; or else the world must be from all eternity, proceeding from the first mover, (whom he conceived to be a necessary, not a free Agent) as heat from the fire, or light from the sun, and therefore eternally existing with that first mover, or first cause: however some have affirmed, that in his Book <HI>de Mundo</HI> (if that be his) he retracted this error, which has been a grand occasion of Atheism, as <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rra</HI>&punc; upon <HI>Aquin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ontra Gent.</HI> has truly observed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>And well he might, if 'twas built upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o sandy a foundation, as to make God a necessary Agent, for that was to render him inferiour to
<PB N="11" REF="9">
some of his Creatures, which are free and volun|tary. But pray leave the Philosopher to his other errors, and self-contradictions, and make it appear, if you can, that he erred in asserting the eternity of the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I hope to perform by principles granted by all sober men.</P>
<P>There is nothing in the world, but either 'twas made, and had a beginning, or 'twas not made, but was from all eternity; now tis evident, that there is no particular thing in this visible world, which was not made. The Sun, Moon, &amp; Stars were made, Men, Beasts and Plants were made. For brevity sake, I shall only instance in the Sun, and in Man, that they were made, and had a beginning, and con|sequently the Moon, and Stars, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">easts, and Plants.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Sun was made, and had a begin|ning, I thus demonstrate: That which was not from all eternity, but had a beginning, was made, and that by somthing else, because nothing can make it self; but the Sun was not from all eter|nity.</P>

<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis evident, by what you say, that the Sun has not moved from eternity, but how can you prove it did not stand still from eternity, seing there are some that hold it alwaies stood still, and never moved to this day, but that the earth moves and the Sun not at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>It hinders not the force of the Argu|ment, whether you hold the earth move, and the Sun stands still, or the contrary; for 'tis but shifting the Scene, and puting the Earth in|stead of the Sun, and the reason will be altogether the same.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>I perceive it does not, and therefore let me hear how you can prove that the Sun did not stand still from all eternity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>If the Sun stood still from eternity, then there was an eternal night upon half the face, or Globe of the earth, and an eternal day up on the other half, (or at least many other gross absurditie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> would follow.) No vicissitudes or changes of night and day, summer and winter, spring and autumn, and consequently no productions, or generations of Men, Beasts, Plants, for that half of the earth which was deprived of the light and heat of the Sun, (which as a second cause gives life and vegeta|tion to all the inferior Creatures, that have life and growth) could bring forth no vegetables, or animals; and the other half, which was alwaies scorched with too much heat, must of necess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ity be as barren by such heat, as the other by extream cold; and so we should have an eternal Sun to no purpose, and then what will become of your eter|nal world?</P>

<P>You have abundantly satisfied me, that the Sun had not an eternal being, and consequent|ly that neither men, beasts, or plants, could be from all eternity; however I desire to hear from you some particular arguments against the eterni|ty of man-kind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no particular man but had&punc; beginning, was made and begotten by his Parents, they by theirs, and so we must ascend from son to father, up to all eternity, <HI>usque ad infinitum,</HI> which is utterly impossible, or else we must come to a first man, who could not make or beget him|self. Now if every particular man be made, and be|gotten, then the whole kind must be made, be|cause the whole kind is nothing else, but the Col|lection of all particulars. Every one of them we see by daily experience had a beginning, and is be|gotten or made; therefore 'tis made by some o|ther, for <HI>quicquid fit, fit ab alio,</HI> and this of some other, and so forward until we come to the su|pream cause of all things, which is God.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="11">Again, Either all men that are, or ever were in the world, were made; or some were made, and some not made, but had being of themselves: if so, 'tis impossible that these men should be of the same kind, with the men that were made, for that which is made depending upon another, can|not be of the same kind with that which is not made and independent, because a thing that is not made, infinite, independent, is of another kind from what is made, finite, and dependent; and these two (finite and infinite, dependent and in|dependent) are opposite members, dividing one and the same most common kind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a clear demonstration, that every particular man being made, the whole kind must be made; hut pray tell me, might there not be a perpetual successive generation of men up to all eternity, and so a <HI>processus in infinitum,</HI> an infi|nite number of them without all beginning?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is altogether impossible; for in a Catologue, or Series of things, every one of which had a beginning, as 'tis evident that every particular man had (and consequently the whole Series) there cannot possible be a <HI>processus in infi|nitum,</HI> up to all eternity, or an infinite succession of causes and effects, without all beginning; E|ternity properly so called, has neither beginning, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> end, for 'tis <HI>duratio interminabilis.</HI> an infinite unlimited duration, and therefore whatsoever had a beginning cannot possibly be eternal, but the whole series of men had a beginning, for what|soever is made had a beginning, but the whole
<PB N="15" REF="11">
Series of men was made, therefore it had a be|ginning, for every particular man had a begin|ing: therefore the whole Series, which is nothing else but a collection of all particulars, and there|fore it cannot be equal or comensurable to eterni|ty, which is without beginning.</P>
<P>Again, If the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eries, or rank of men did run up to eternity, or into an infinite number of succes|sive generations, then that infinite number of men have been swallowed up of death many millions of years before this age we live in, and so death has passed over that number, which is contrary to that certain principle, <HI>infinitum non potest pertran|siri</HI>; 'tis impossible to pass over, or through that which is infinite: nay then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">here would not be a|ny man living at present; for if an infinite number of men are already dead, then all the men that e|ver were or may be are dead, for <HI>infinito nihil po|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ddi.</HI> Yea if the world should continue ten millions of years longer, there could not be after those ten millions of years more men in it, then there were ten millions of years before this pre|sent; for nothing can be added to that which is properly infinite, to make it greater in magnitude, or more in number, neither could the Father be before the Son, nor the gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t Grandfather be|fore or elder then either; <HI>nam in aternitate non datur prius &amp; posterius.</HI> In this infinite duration, there is no former or latter, and consequently had the world been from all eternity, it could not tru|ly be said, that any man was before another; not Abraham before Isaac, or he before Jacob.</P>

<P>You have made it very plain, that the world had a beginning, and consequently (because tis ridiculous to suppose that it had its beginning from it selfe, chance, or Atomes) that there is one supream cause of infinite power and wisdome, the Creator of Heaven and Earth, and of all things therein contained, which is the Glorious and eternal God, of whose being I hope I shall hence forth never entertain the least doubt.</P>

<P>Though I am fully satisfied in that great fundamental point, yet in this I commend your Charity, and do not envy the satisfaction of others.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>The other reason which I shall pro|duce shall b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> taken from the Goodly fabrick of the world, the harmonious order of all things there|in contained, the horror of conscience in wicked
<PB N="17" REF="12">
men; the dread of perjury in very heathens, the appearance of evil Spirits, their strange working in witches and wizards; which may be seen more largely treated of in Doctor <HI>Fotherbys Atheoma|stix, Doctor Andrews Cattechisme, Du-Plessis truth of Christian Religion, Grotius of the same, Doctor Mores Antidote against Atheism, Parsons Resoluti|ons, Doctor Stillingfleets Origines sacrae, Gales Gen|tils Court, Mr. Baxters Christian Religion,</HI> with many others: I shall breifly sum up what these learned men have wrot at large, beginning with that argument which is taken from the Goodly fabrick of the world. 1. Twas excellently said of Tertul. <HI>lib. de Resur. facilius credas Prophetiae si sis discipulus naturae,</HI> if we be conversant in the works of nature, they will lead us to the knowledg and beliefe of Scripture. There is a most sweet harmony, betwixt those two Books, the Book of Nature and the Book of Grace. What is said of the one, <HI>monstrat Quaelibet herba Deum</HI>; every herb or plant does shew there is a God, is most true of the Scripture; <HI>Quaelibet linea Deum refert,</HI> e|very line in this Book, shews us the power, pro|vidence, and wisdome of God.</P>
<P>And if the Atheist will disdain to read this ex|cellent Commentary upon the Book of nature, let him seriously peruse the Text, the harmonious beauty and order of the Universe. Plato and some other of the Antients, were used to demon|strate the being of a Supream Deity by a Clock; whose hammer when it striketh sheweth the next wheele that moves it, that the next, and so for|ward
<PB N="18" REF="13">
until you come to the Clockmaker; who made all the wheels, and caused their regular motions.</P>
<P>Another instance is commonly made use of, If a man should travel into a far Country, at pre|sent not inhabited, and there should behold some Goodly building, he would presently conclude it grew not out of the Ground, neither did the be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sts make it, but twas the work of some ingeni|ous Artists; Or if a man should behold a well or|dered army of Soldiers, keeping rank and file, turning altogether (as if they were animated by one Soul) sometimes to the right hand, some|times to the left, he would presently conclude that there was some expert Commander to direct them. Even so he that casts his Eye upon this Good|ly Fabrick of the world, must needs acknowledg the great Power and Wisdom of its Maker; He that shall seriously observe the harmonious order, the regular motions of its parts, must needs acknow|ledge the truth of that saying, Psal. 19.1. <HI>the heavens declare the Glory of God, and the firmament sheweth his ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dy work.</HI> And Rom. 1.19. <HI>That which may be known of God is manifest in them, for the in|v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sible things of God are clearly seen, by those things that are made; viz his eternal power and Godhead.</HI> Job. 26.7. <HI>He stretcheth out the North over t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.</HI> Se|riously consider what is wrote in the, 36.37.38. Chapt. &amp;c. of that Book, besides many other ex|cellent Texts in the holy Scripture, declaring how the Glory, wisdome, power of God is ma|nifest in the admirable frame of the world, and the
<PB N="19" REF="13">
exquisite order and harmony of all things therein contained. See how the Heavens warm and water the Earth; how the earth, brings forth the grass, herbs, and plants&punc; how these feed the beasts; how the beasts serve the several necessities of man; who is the only Creature (the immortal Angels except|ed) that can in a rational manner serve, and set forth the glory of his Creator.</P>

O saith David, Psal. 8. <HI>when I consider the Moon and the Stars, which thou hast ordained, what is man that thou art so mindfull of him, and the Son of man that thou visitest him</HI>?</P>

<P>Consider the fish in the Sea, the beasts in the Land, the fowls of the Air, see how they declare the glory of their maker, peruse with a serious and diligent Eye the, 39.40.41. Chap. of Job as before.</P>

<P>Some Pagans a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d false Christians, have dared to take false Oaths. The Jesuites (whether they be Pagans or Christians I know not) will swear anything, even solemnly in Courts of Ju|stice, and therefore this argument&punc; (impious me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> dare

<P>I do confess that there have been seve|ral perjured persons in former, and are in these present times, but for a full answer to this excep|tion, see what is replyed to another very like it <HI>Pag.</HI> 4. however I am content the argument should stand, as you have proposed it, strange horror and terrors of conscience, and fearfull judgment have followed perjured persons, &amp;c. which suffi|ciently proves what I intended, and therefore I proceed.</P>
<P>Another argument very like to this, or which is rather an addition to the former, may be tak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n from the feares and torments of an evil co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sci|ence, even amongst the very heathens. <HI>Nero</HI> have|ing killed his Mother, confessed that he was often troubled which her Ghost. The wretched Caligula at the report of a thunder clap would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">un under his bed. A thousand instances there are amongst heathen writers, of wicked men labour|ing under the feares and terrors of their own co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|science, which Juvenal does describe to the life in one or two of his Satyrs. What should be the reason that mere Pagans, men having no know|ledg
<PB N="24" REF="16">
of the true God, or of his Severity against wickedness, should be tormented with the sad prospect of some fearefull judgment, attending up|on their villanies tho never so secretly practised, but the <HI>timor Numinis vindicantis,</HI> the fear of divine vengeance?</P>
<P>A third argument may be drawn from the cer|tainty that there are Devils, evil Spirits, to|gether with their wicked Instruments, Witches, Magicians, Sorcerers, Conjurers, which none but a foolish Atheist (who will believe no further then his sight leads him) can doubt of. How fre|quently the Devil has appeared in this nation in times of gross ignorance<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and superstition, and how he does so still to the poor 'Indians th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t worship him for their God, is aboundantly mani|fest by the tradition of our fore fathers, and the testimony of knowing Christians, that have been in those parts. What pranks and diabolical feats, have been acted by Witches and Conjurers, may be seen in those learned Authors, that have wrot against them; as Dr. <HI>Moor,</HI> and many others. And albeit the appearances of evil Spirits, Witch-crafts, &amp;c. are not now so frequent in this nation as heretofore, in times of Popery, and darke Ignorance, yet does it not therefore follo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, that all our forefathers were Melancholly Hypocondriacks, deceived them|selves, and deceiving us with vain and ground|less phansies: but the true reason is this, in times of ignorance, and superstition the Devil appears more frequently, to uphold his Kingdome over his vassals, and to confirm them in their false wor|ship;
<PB N="25" REF="16">
but in times of knowledg and Gospel light, the Prince of Darkness uses all his arts to render men Scepticks in Religion, and of no Religion at all, Atheists, Infidels, Prophane: so that his very appearing would pull down his Kingdome, which he exercises over these wretches, who like Saddu|cees believe neither Angel, nor Spirit, nor any thing further then they can see. Now the Prince o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Air is too subtil to confute this Gro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s errour in his best servants by any or often appari|tions.</P>
<P>The last reason I shall take from that allowed disti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ction that is betwixt good and evil, better and worse; which could not be, unless there were some measure of mans actions: and this mea|sure must be a law, either written in mans heart, or instituted and written in bookes or tables; and thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> law must have a law maker, which must be able both to know, reward, and punish, not only mans words and actions, but his very thoughts, which none can do according to the exact rules of Ju|stice, but he that is infinite in knowledg, and wisdom; that is, none but the omniscient God.</P>
<P>Besides all this, there are degrees in good and evil; for of things that are good, some are better then others, of things that are evil some are worse then other. Now these degrees of good and evil, take their rise and fall by their aproaching to, or declination from that which is <HI>summum bonum,</HI> or the chiefest good; so that, if there were no best, or cheifest good, there could be no better or worse, no
<PB N="26" REF="17">
good or evil at all, therefore there must be one infinite good.</P>
<P>To conclude this first discourse; seeing the inclination of all People, to believe a God, the instinct of nature to confess it, the excel|lent fabrick of the world to declare it, the force of wicked mens consciences to fear it; the Custom of civil nations to adore it, do abundantly prove that God is, yea doubtless that there is a God, that judgeth the earth, what a monstrous Creature is the fool Atheist, that saith in his heart there is no God?</P>

<P>These things being granted; that (not to mention other Creatures) as man had his being, reason, and understanding from Al|mighty God, so is he bound to serve him in that way and manner, which is agreeable to mans excellent nature, which must be there|fore a reasonable service, which all the world, as well Pagans as Jews, and Christians call Religion, which according to all sober people comprehends duties of piety, as praier, praises and sacrifices, duties of temperance, sobriety, and chastity, duties of honesty, justice, righteousness, and all morality.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is nothing more evident, then that as there is a most wise and holy God, that made man, endued him with excellent facultys, of reason and understanding, so there is a debt and du|ty owing from man to God, his maker, which all the world calls Religion, and no people in the world were ever so barbarous, (saies <HI>Cicero</HI>) as to be de|stitute of all Religion; yea there is such a tendency in&punc; the nature of man (where tis not utterly extin|guished by brutish sensuality) that rather then he will worship no God at all, he will bow down to a Sock, or a Stone; so that clear it is, if there be a God the Creatour, and man by him created, there must of necessity be a Religion.</P>

<P>Truly nothing does more necessarily follow (as <HI>Du-Plessis</HI> has well observed) then a God, a man, a Religion. But if Almighty God did make man to worship him, sure he gave him some rules for that worship, some law to direct him in this great concern of his Soul.</P>

<P>If of all religions in the world, all are not in the right, how will you know which is the true Religion, which is the false? This you cannot discern by any imprinted law or light of nature (unless excited by Art and industry) which is in some measure common to all men that are not natural fools, and Madmen, stupid inconsiderate wretches, or debauched bruits, whose reason is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">unk down into gross Sensuality.</P>

<P>Tis very true, if the meer light of na|ture were sufficient to point out the true Religi|on, I am not able to say why so many Sober men, in several parts of the world, who have not de|bauched their Reason, and judgment should so strangely differ about it.</P>

<P>I believe you cannot, nor yet why Jewes and Pagans did offer up bloody Sacrifices to these Deitys, they worshipped. Does any light of nature make it rational that the Gods should be pleased with the blood of poor innocent Beasts? or is it rational to imagine that they should de|light in humane <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">acrifices?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must acknowledge I do not understand, how the light of nature should teach men, that such Sacrifices should please the Gods.

<P>You are satisfied that it had not its ori|ginal from the light of nature; for albeit, some kind of Sacrifices as Prayers, praises, alms-deeds, and it may be the offering of the Fruits of the Earth, <HI>Deo datori,</HI> to God that gave them, might spring from that light, yet the Sacrificing of Beasts was never shewed, to Jew or Gentile by natures Candle, but was after the fall of man, ap|pointed by Almighty God to prefigure the Grand propitiatory Sacrifice, which was to be made by the blood of him, that was the lamb slain from the foundation of the world, which the Devil (who is tearmed Gods Ape) taught his servants the Gen|tils

<P>This I shall easily do; beginning with <HI>Paganism,</HI> which consists in the worshiping of

<P>That this Religion of Pagans was against the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w, and light of nature, both in respect of the things wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">shipped, and also in respect of the abominable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ites and Ceremonies, any man that has the least sparke of that light re|maining in him, may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">asily discern.</P>
<P>First, The things worshipped were the Crea|tures, some of them that never had life, o|thers th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t once lived but are now dead, whose ghosts or <HI>Manes</HI> the Heathens imagi|ned to be confined to their Idols; whereas no Creature can be c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pable of Religious wor|s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ip; for 'tis repugnant to all right reason, that one Creature should thus worship another, God alone being the proper object of such wor|ship, because in him we live, move, and have our being, and he it is that gives us life and breath, and all things; therefore <HI>Deo datori,</HI> to God the Creator, and giver of all good things, all religious worship is only due.</P>
<P>Besides some of the wiser Heathens, ac|knowledg that there could be but one God;
<PB N="35" REF="21">
'twas a common saying amongst them, <HI>dicite plures, dicite nullum,</HI> 'tis all one to say there are many Gods, as to say there is no God, for the notion which they had of God, was that he was <HI>ens infinitum,</HI> a being of infinite power and perfection; but natural reason shew|ed them that there could be but one infi|nite, because infinite power, and infinite per|fection, comprehends all power and perfecti|on, and therefore it cannot be communicated to many, or more then one.</P>
<P>Secondly, Their Rites and Ceremonies were so ridiculous, and so filthy, that the A|postle stiles them <HI>abominable Idolatries,</HI> 'tis a|gainst the rules of Christian modesty, either to hear or speak of them.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may please to receive them thus; my first reason shall be taken from the novel|ty of, it being not much above a Thousand years since that false Prophet Mahomet pub|lished his rapsody of nonsence, <HI>fabulous fictions,</HI> and damnable Blasphemys to the world.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="22">First, From which I thus argue, truth is before falsehood, <HI>Illud verum quod antiquum</HI>; see|ing the world is now above 5500 years old, and seeing Religion has been practised in it from the Creation, tis absurd to imagine, there was no true Religion before Mahomet, or that the in|finite goodness and wisdom of God, should suf|fer gross errors to infect the whole world at least 3000 years before the true worship of his holy name was known unto men.</P>
<P>Secondly, Mahometism is a mixture of Ju|daism, Heresy, and Paganism, with some sprink|lings of Christianity, A bundle of ridiculous fables, prodigious lies, as is evident to any that shall peruse the Alcoran.</P>
<P>Thirdly, 'Twas propagated by the Sword, and such carnal weapons, by sensual motives, and promises of fleshly pleasures, to be injoyed by all those that should be followers of that grand impostor, which are so unworthy of the rational soul, that they cannot be called the cords of man, but are only proper allurements for those whose reason is sunk down into brutish sensuality.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>These reasons do sufficiently manifest the folly and falseness of this new or rather no Religion, but pray you inform me why you rank Judaism in the number of false religious, seeing tis grounded on the Scripturs of the Old Testa|ment, which you beleive to be a divine Revelation.</P>

<P>When I reckon Judaism amongst false Religions, I mean only that religion which is

professed by the modern Jews, under &amp; against the Gospel, not that which their forefathers under the law lived and died in. Since the fall of Adam unto the end of the world there was and shall be but one true Religion, consisting of Repentance from dead works, holy obedience, and faith in Je|sus Christ; so that the fathers before the law, the Israelites under the law, the Christians under the Gospel, were and are of one and the same Religi|on, for the substance of it; 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.1.2.3. they did believe in Christ to come, the Christians do believe that he is already come; to them he was vailed in Types and shadows&punc; to us he is revealed, and those shadows are vanished at the rising of the Sun of Righteousness with healing in his wings.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am fully satisfied by the characters which you have given of the Religion in practise with the people of God (especially with the Christians) that the rule and measure of it must be from heaven &amp; not from men, and consequently that all holy Scripture is divinely inspired, &amp; is the word of the eternal God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I could further acquaint you with many mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e reasons to confirm you in this great truth, which are common in every Authour that treats of it; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s namely the Antiquity of holy Scripture, some part of it being before all writings; the continu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nce of it by an extraordinary providence, notwith|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tanding the rage and malice of cruel bloody per|secutors,

the sincerity, impartiality, candour, sim|plicity of its writers, <HI>quibus nullum fuit mendac ii praemium,</HI> they had no earthly motives to perswade them to utter such forgeries (as Atheist deem them to be) nothing but bonds and imprisonments, losses of goods and lives. Again it must be acknowledged, that the Pen-men of the Scripture, were very good men, or very bad, (for men of a cold indifferency they could not be.) If they were very good men, they would never have conspired together, to put such a cheat, such a grand imposture upon the world (as Anti-Scripturists would have the word of God to be.) If very bad, they would never have wrot with so much zeal, and earnestness against all manner of wickedness, and especially, against Lying and Hypocrisie. Certainly they would never have exposed themselves, to hazard lives and fortunes for no other reward, then to be esteemed both Knaves and Fools by all prudent men. Add to this that Lyers and Cheats do not usually agree one with the other; but there is such a sweet harmony &amp; consent betwixt the Pen-men of Holy writ, tho they lived at so great a distance from one another, that questionless they were acted by one and the same infallible spirit.</P>
<P>Lastly, The aversness, the slowness that is in our corrupt hearts to believe all that is written in the Law and the Prophets, <HI>Luke</HI> 24.25. a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ising from that contrariety which is betwixt the holy and spi|ritual word of God, and our carnal and depraved minds, is no small proof of the truth of it, for 'tis otherwise impossible to render any ration<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l ac|count, why we should doubt, or disbelieve this sa|cred

word, and never once question the truth of or|dinary and common Histories, which are conveyed down unto us, not with the tenth part of that evi|dence which we have of the truth of holy Scrip|ture.</P>
<P>But waving these reasons, I shall only mention Two of the best which are urged against Infidelity, to bring up the reer of my discourse. The First whereof shall be taken from the fulfilling of Pro|phesies; the other from Miracles, which are the Seals of this our <HI>Magna Charta.</HI></P>

<P>I grant it; but hear what judgment a learned Heathen passes upon them.

<P>Indeed a Testimony from an adversary is beyond all exception, I rest satisfied with what you have said, for the Authority of the Old Te|stament; have you any thing to say for the New, more then what you have said in general for them both together?</P>

<P>Yes; I have the miracles of our Savi|our, and his blessed Apostles, wrought for the confirmation of what they taught, acknoledged by Heathens, <HI>Grotius de ver. Chris.

<P>You may add to this the miraculous preservation of both Testaments, not withstanding the malice of persecuting Heathens; who used all arts of cru|elty to extinguish them; the propagation of the Christian Religion, into so many parts of the pre|judicating world, without, yea contrary to all carnal force and worldly inte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">est, by a few simple unlearned men, which if twas done without a Mi|racle, was one of the greate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t Miracles that ever we read of. To this may be added the opposition of many subtil Hereticks, who never durst so much as question the Authority of the Scripture,
<PB N="47" REF="27">
but rather betook themselves to their own false glosses, that they might shift of those clear texts which made against them; whereas it had been a more Compendious way to have utterly denyed them, if their impudence had been so great, as to oppose the general belief, of those times where|in they lived.</P>

<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tho I am sufficiently convinced, of the di|vine Authority of the Scripture, and of the truth of those Miracles which were wronght by Christ and his Apostles for the confirmation of what they taught; yet to remove all scruples that may be made against them, I shall desire to be more fully satisfied in two exceptions that are urged by Anti|scripturists.</P>
<P N="1">1. That they were no true Miracles.</P>
<P N="2">2. That we have no certainty that there were ever such persons in the world as Christ and his Apostles, or that they ever wrought such mighty works as are recorded of them in the New Testa|ment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>That there were such persons in the world as Christ and his Apostles, that they wrought those Miracles which are mentioned in the Histo|ry of them, both Jews and Gentiles, (sworn ene|mies to Christianity,) acknowledg, but besides their Testimony (which being from adversaryes is v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y cogent) we have the tradition of the Ca|tholick Church in all ages, and most places of the world, for 1600 years and upwards; and as he that will go up by the side of the River will at last
<PB N="48" REF="28">
come to the head and fountain of it, so he that shall ascend through the several Centuries of the Church, will at last infallibly come to the head of it <HI>Christ Iesus</HI>; to the place of his Nativity; his Preaching and mighty Works that he did; his bitter death and bloody passion; or if he shall descend from Christ, through the same Centuries, down to this present time, he may be farr more certain, of the birth, and life, and works, and suf|ferings of this our bessed Saviour, of the writings of the Holy Evangelists, and Apostles, then that there have been such men in the world as <HI>Alexand|er</HI> the great, <HI>Iulius Caesar, Pompey, Scipio, Han|nibal,</HI> of the Warrs, and noble Acheivements ma|naged by them, of <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour, the Barons warrs, and yet none but a fool or a mad man, or one that has vowed to believe no farther then what he can see with his own eyes, will doubt of these; for that the tradition which conveys the same of these Worthies, and their Actions down unto us, is nothing so general as that of the Catholick Church, neither is it at all practical, but purely historical, wherein we are not at all concern|ed, whether or no the things reported of those no|ble warriours be true or false.</P>

<P>He that will not assent to what is deliver|ed by universal Tradition, takes away the use of one of the most noble Sciences in the world, <HI>viz.</HI> Histo|ry; and wants rather a Cudgel then an Argu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent to confute him. Tis evident by undeniable traditi|on, that there were such persons as Christ and his Apostles, that thay did great and marveilous things, but how shall we know whether the works

<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Th&ocirc; at present this may appear diffi|cult to you, yet I hope I shall make this difference as manifest to you, as is that which is betwixt Gold and drosse.

<P>But to wave such subtilties, a true miracle may be known from a false one,</P>
<P N="1">1.

<P N="2">2. A true miracle may be known from that which is a jugle or imposture, by the design or end of it, which is for the confirmation of a di|vine revelation, to bring men over to the worship

<P>But doe not you now run into the same erro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r which you so lately condemned in others? for by what you have said I must first know which is the true Religion, before I can know which is a true miracle, and surely then there will be no use of miracles, to confirme me in the truth, of what I knew before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>there is a mutuall confirmation, betwixt the true religion, and a true miracle; true Re|ligion does give light to miracles, these do seal and confirm that Religion. We see that all discur|sive knowledge, does arise from some precedent knowledge, untill we ascend to such principles, that are clear to the light of nature, now evident it is to natural reason, that there is a God, Crea|tour of all things; that there is but one God, that this one God ought to be religiously wor|shipped, the intelligent and learned heathens, have acknowledged all these: Again 'tis evident that there were never but four general Religi|ons in the world, Paganisme, Turcisme, Judaisme and Christianity, and I think I have already made it manifest, that of all these Religions, none is so r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|tional or such a reasonable service, as is that of the Christian; which for the substance of it is the oldest of all others, being the same which was practi|sed, by the fathers both before and after the flood, for the spirituality, morality, and unity of the
<PB N="51" REF="29">
God hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> worshipped, 'tis excellent beyond all others, most agreeable to the Common principles and notices of the reasonable Soul.</P>
<P>Here upon any serious sober man, may con|clude that all these miracles which have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t|tempted to draw men from Christianity, are but mere impostures, and those that have been wrought for the confirmation of it, wherein one true God of infinite majesty, wisdome, power, and glory, is worshipped in spirit and truth, are the only true miracles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray Sir excuse me this unnecessary trouble which I have given you; for by what you had said before concerning, the supereminent excel|lency of the Christian Religion, above all o|thers, I might have seen the force of your reaso|ning, which (as I conceive stands thus&punc; If the Christian Religion be the only t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ue Religion then those miracles which were wrought for the Con|firmation of it, are the only true miracles.</P>

<P>You rightly conclude: I shall therefore proceed to the third note or marke of a true mir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cle, and that is the effect and consequent of such a miracle, which is the drawing of the mind from sin to God, the primitive Christians much insisted on this as an undoub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed evidence of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e miracles wrought by Christ, that they were done by divine power, because the effect that follow|ed them was the worke of conversion of Sou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> from sin and Ido<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, to Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and Christ&punc; and all true piety and holinesse of life; they tended main|ly

<P>I Hope you have well considered of the questions which I lately proposed unto you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>To the first I returne this answer, My reasons that induced me to adhere to the Church of Rome were these.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Antiquity of that Church which has continued ever since the Apostles time, when by the testimony of St. Paul, her faith was spoken of throughout the world. <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.8.</P>
<P N="2">2. The universality of it; no Church has spread it self, so farr and nere upon the face of the earth, as that of Rome.</P>
<P N="3">3. Her consent in Doctrine with the primi|tive Church.</P>
<P N="4">4. The unity of it, under one infallible head
<PB N="61" REF="34">
which cannot err in poynt of faith or manners.</P>
<P N="5">5 The sanctity of it's Doctrine; that 'tis free from errour in matters of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aith; free from all immorality and improbity in point of man|ners.</P>
<P N="6">6. The sanctity of life, in the authors, and first-fathers, of the Roman Religion: these were the chief motives that caused me to adhere to the Church of Rome.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed these are six of those 15 notes which Bella<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mine <HI>Lib.</HI> 4. <HI>de not. Eccle.</HI> and others of his perswasion appropriate to that Church: but had you not some other inducements? As first a vitious life, and the cheap and easy pardon of your Sins upon confession of them to a priest, his absolution and injunction of a pitifull pen|nance. 2dly, were you not under some discontent for your present low Condition? or 3dly, were you not ambitious of preferment, deeming po|pery to be a ready way to it? or 4thly, were you not tickled with the Cunning extolling of your ex|cellent parts by some subtile Jesuite, lamenting your sad Condition, that a person o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> so rare en|dowments, should be so miserably mistaken in the great concern of your Soule, perswading you that out of the Church there is no hope of sal|vation, and that you being no member of the Church of Rome, were past all peradventure out of the Church, and unlesse you returned to that Church, there could be no hope of your salva|tion? or lastly before you set up for the Church of Rome, were you serious and conscientiou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truely Sir I am verily perswaded, that many who have left your Church, and gone over to that of Rome, have stumbled at such straws: but you have known me long, to be a man of no vitious life, no male Content, not ambitious of honour or preferment, not apt to be paffed up with a proud conceit of mine own parts, not cold or carelesse in point of Religion; but the chiefe reasons that moved me to goe over to the Church of Rome, were those before named, which made me believe that Church, to be the only true Catholick Church, out of which there could be no hope of salvation; to these I beg your answer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you shall have it.</P>
<P N="1">1. The doctrine of the present Church of Rome which alone could denominate her anci|ent, Catholick, and Apostolicall, is in severall weighty points quite contrary to holy scripture, neither hath it the generall consent of the fa|thers and Doctors of the Catholick Church: the pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sent Church of Rome, is no more like to
<PB N="63" REF="35">
what it once was, in the purest primitive times&punc; than an old decrepit man full of diseases, Gout, Stone, Palsy, Dropsy, Scurvey, Blindnesse, Deafnesse, Wrinkles, and a multitude of in|firmities, is the same Strong, Handsome, Heal|thy Man, that he was when at twenty five or thirty years old.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Th&ocirc; I have sometimes much reverenced the Church of Rome, for her antiquity, yet now I begin to doubt that there are many disea|ses in the body of that Church, many wrinkles in her face, which were not from the beginning&punc; but not withstanding those infirmities, 'tis the same true Church as 'twas at the first plantation, as the old decrepite man is the same man that e|ver he was for substance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I deny not but that the Church of Rome is in some sence the same it first was, in respect of divers Articles it holds: but in respect of those gross errours, it now maintaines, 'tis no more like what it was, then the old decrepite diseased man is like what he was in his younger dayes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your comparison is very good and appo|site to the present Church of Rome, which past dispute is full of dangerous and desperate diseases, as I in part do apprehend. I pray you proceed to my other motive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Church of Rome, is not so univer|sal as her disciples boast of, neither in respect of place or time.</P>
<P N="1">1. 'Tis the observation of a learned man, that
<PB N="64" REF="36">
if the world were divided into 30 parts, 19 of them are heathens, 6 Mahometans, and 5 Christians, of which the Papists are not the one halfe, as Mr. Breirwood in his Enquires does de|monstrate.</P>
<P N="2">2. As to the universality of time, the Church of Rome cannot deduce her present tenents, from the beginning of Christianity, through the seve|ral ages or Centuryes: that it has continued a Church, from the first preaching of the Gospell I deny not; but that 'tis the same for purity of Doctrine, as once it was, is most false: for the antient Church of Rome, never taught worship|ing of images, praying to Saints, that monstrous transubstantiation, halfe Communion, Praier in an unknowne tongue, and many more Ground|less fopperies, against Scripture, the general consent of fathers, common sence and reason.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>All this, I am inclined to believe: but how could these errours creepe into a Church, which did so punctually observe the traditions of their forefathers? what the Church of Rome now believes and teaches, it received from the Church that was in the next age before it, that from the Church next before it, and so quite down to the Apostles times, as the Author of the Dialogues betwixt <HI>the Vnckle and the Nephew,</HI> hath most learnedly demonstra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly very learnedly, even as <HI>Zeno</HI> proved there was no locall motion: you have heard how <HI>Diogenes</HI> confuted him by an ocular demonstration: were not the Scribes and Phari|ses
<PB N="65" REF="36">
great pretenders to a Strict observation of the traditions of their fathers? And yet we know how grosly they had corrupted the law of <HI>Moses,</HI> as is evident by our Saviours confutation of them. <HI>Mat.</HI> 5. and in severall other places.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Crakan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">thorp</HI> and other Learned pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|stants do evidently shew, the beginning, the progress of the Corruptions of the Church of Rome, the manner of their spring and Growth; but Suppose we cannot punctually t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll, the be|ginning and progress of such and such an errour, shall we therefore believe it to be no errour you walk sometimes in the fields,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">visse videas crescere non vides.</HI></NOTE> 'tis evident to your eyes that the Grasse a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d graine do grow, though you do not see them move at all; some|times you visit a friend that is sick of a langui|shing consumption, you see by infallible symp|toms that your friend is in a desperate Condition, will you not believe him to be so, because you cannot tell the time when, or the manner how, his disease came upon him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot be so unreasonable; and by what you have said, my third reason falls to the Ground, for the present Church of Rome has no agreement with the primitive, but is extreamly opposite to it, in the points before named, be|sides many others; I pray let me hear what you can say against their unity; for they seem to be firm|ly united, under one infallible head the Pope.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truely Sir they do but seem so; for they are miserably divided in the great fundamentall
<PB N="66" REF="37">
of their faith,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>see</HI> Mr. <HI>Pools Nul|lity of the Roman Faith.</HI></NOTE> their infallibility, and are not they ve|ry unjust to us to exact our beliefe, of that, which they themselves know not where to find? for some of them tell us 'tis fixed to the Popes chair; some say 'tis to be found in a Generall Councell, ot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rs believe it to be in neither, but in both u|nited together, others would perswade us that 'tis in the whole body of the Church; so that if you seek after this pretty knack of infallibillity; you will be abused as young apprentices are used to be in great Cittys and corporations; who in wagge|ry, are sent from shop to shop for a penyworth of Ell-broad Packthred; or a pound of stock-fish Tal|low: or a Lefthanded Shuttle; after these poore novices have been sent from one end of the Citty to the other, they returne home, without such ridiculous Commodities, and are sufficiently ex|posed to laughter and derision.</P>
<P>There's scarce a Controversy in all Bellarmin's voluminous workes wherein he recites not the different opinions of the Roman Catholicks a|mong themselves, insomuch that this great Cardi|nals, workes were not to be bought in Rome (as Sir <HI>Edw: Sandyes</HI> reports in his <HI>Europa specu|lum</HI>) because he had so imprudently discovered, the nakednesse of his mother in point of u|nity.</P>
<P>To say nothing of the contentions betwixt the <HI>Thomists</HI> and <HI>Scotists, Ochamists</HI> &amp;c: 'tis pleasant to see how sweetly the <HI>Dominicans, Franciscans Iesuites, Molinists, Iansenists,</HI> Regulars, and
<PB N="67" REF="37">
seculars agree together. Though a lat&eacute; Pope durst be so bold as to decide a Controversy for the <HI>Molimists</HI> against the <HI>Iansenians,</HI> and so that which was none before, very luckily became an article of Faith (such is the Popes omnipotent Power, that he can create Articles of Faith, out of that which was a pure no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">-entity, a very no|thing in the primitive times) yet I heare that the <HI>Iansenists</HI> are so saucy as to continue very <HI>Iansenists</HI> still, notwithstanding his holinesses in|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">allible determination.</P>

<P>By what I have said (I hope) you are satisfied, that you had no justifyable reasons to adhere to the Church of Rome, as 'tis now, so much declined from the Primitive; let me know how and why you did forsake it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am fully satisfied that the reasons, which drew me over to that Church were false and fallacious, and am now as much confirmed, that the reasons which made me leave her Com|munion are solid and demonstrative.</P>
<P N="1">1. Which were her monstrous unnecessary imposible Doctrine of transubstantiation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you prove that to be unneces|sary?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>The change of the bread and wine into the very body and blood of Christ is unnecessary, because certain it is (and they of the Church of Rome acknowledge it) that there never was any such change in the Sacraments of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he old Testa|ment, neith<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r is there any in the other six of the New, (as the Papists are pleased to multiply
<PB N="70" REF="39">
them; now if all other Sacraments without any such miraculous change, do attain their ends, for which they were instituted, why should it be required in the holy Eucharist? why not rather in that of baptism? why should not the baptis|mall water be changed into Christs very blood? this being the Sacrament of Regeneration, that that of Nutrition; surely as great a power and vertue is required, to regenerate and make a Christian, as to nourish and strengthen him.</P>
<P>Again the faithful both before and under the law did eate and drink the body and blood of Christ, in a Spiritual manner, before he had ei|ther body or blood. <HI>They did eat the same Spiri|tual Meat and dranke the same Spiritual Drinke</HI>; 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.3. what need is there then of a Transubstantiation? If we seriously peruse the sixt Chapt: of St. <HI>Iohns</HI> Gospel, we may learne that the body of Christ is eaten and his blood dranke in a Spiritual manner, that when the Disciples murmured, at what our Saviour had delivered in the former verses, to satisfye them, he replyes that the words which he spake, were spirit and life: <HI>Ver.</HI> 63. and not to be under|stood according to their gross conception.</P>
<P>I know some the Church of Rome affirm, that in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat Chapter, our blessed Saviour speaks not of a Sacramentall eating of the body of Christ; but certainly is his body may be eaten, and his blood drank, without any such monstrous change by every true beleiver not Receiving, why may not he eat the body and drink the
<PB N="71" REF="39">
blood of Christ, without any substantiall change of the Bread and Wine when he receives? be|sides <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> most (if not all) of the ancient fathers, who held a necessity of giveing the Eucharist to infants, urge the 53. verse of this Chapter, for their opinion and practise, <HI>except yee Eat the Flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his Bloud, ye have no life in you,</HI> Surely therefore they conceived, that our Saviour meant by these words a Sacramentall eating, how then dare any of the Clergy of the Church of Rome, expound it otherwise, seeing they take an oath never to expound Scripture, but according to the unani|mous consent of the Fathers: see the <HI>forma ju|ramenti professionis fidei.

<P>I very much approve your reason against the necessity of transubstantiation: Let me here from you why you tearme it monstrous, and im|possible?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis therefore monstrous and impossible, because it implyes Contradictions, and grosse absurdities 1. that a body is not a body; an accident is not an accident, for if there should be such a change, the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me numericall body of our Saviour, must be in Heaven and Earth, nay in ten thousand places at the same time, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">it must be extended and not extended, it must have dimensions and no dimensions, finite and not finite, which cannot be, no not by Gods om|nipotent, and absolute power; how do the schoolmens Noddles abound with nicetyes,

quidditys, perseities, Chimaeras, to solve such in|compossibilities?</P>
</SP>
<P N="2">2. This strange Metamorphosis doth make acci|dents to be no accidents, it takes away the ve|ry being of them; for <HI>accid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntis esse, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sse,</HI> the being of an accident is in-being, here must be Colour, sapor, odor, quantity without a Subject, which is all one as if we should say a man might be a man without a reasonable Soule, In a word I would willingly learne, what does become of Christs Body, and Bloud after 'tis received into the mouth, (or if any prophane mouse should swallow part of it, or lick up a drop of the bloud) and thence into the stomach, whether it be retransubstantiated into bread and wine, or else be converted by the conco|ctive, and nutritive faculty, into the body of the Communicant, as other nourishment is, and then twill necessarily follow, that Christs Body is essentially united unto, and made one with the Body of every Communicant, which borders very nere upon B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">asphemy, for by this means <HI>Iames Nailer</HI> will ere long (<HI>quod animus m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mi|nisse horret</HI>) be Jesus Christ.</P>
<P N="3">3. This Transubstantiation (if any such thing were possible) is wrought by a miracle, but was ever any miracle done by Christ and his A|postles, which was not discernable by the sences? when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e cured the blind, the dumb, the lame, when he turned water into wine, was not this manifest to the Sight, the Smell, the Tast? shall we think that the God of truth Gave to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n five
<PB N="73" REF="40">
Scences, to deceive 4 of them by one pretended miracle? or that 'tis his method to informe the mind by Impostures? if one or two or three Senses may be deceived, why not all? then what will become of Romes orall Tradition? for may not the eare be deceived as well as the eye? the nose, the tast, the touch? here are 4 Sences to one against that tradition, and then how are the papists certain of what they have received from the present Church, or how is shee cer|taine of what shee received from the Church im|mediatly before her? is not the doctrine of Transubstantiation, which teaches men not to believe their eyes, and other of their Sences, a ready way to Atheism, and infidelity? for if four of the five Sences may be deceived then fare|well all tradition, and if these inferiour faculties, may be thus bafled, what satisfaction could it have been to St. <HI>Thomas</HI> that Christ was truly ri|sen from the dead by putting his finger into the print of the nailes, or his hand into his side?</P>
<P>But beside what sence and reason, witness against this monstrous opinion, the Scripture is clearely opposite unto it, for Christ at the institution of this Sacrament, did not take his own Body into his hand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, but Bread, he brake not his owne Body, but Bread, he did not eat his own Body, he did not drinke his owne Blood, but he drank of the fruit of the Vine, <HI>Mat.</HI> 26.29. for so he called it after Consecration and Distribution; <HI>I will not drink henceforth of the fruit of the Vine</HI> &amp;c. in like manner St. <HI>Paul.</HI> 'Tis stil this bread and this cup. 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.26.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="41">When our Saviour saies (<HI>Hoc est corpus meum</HI>) what doth (hoc) stand for? either it must sig|nify this thing in my hand, (i. e.) the bread, or else his own body&punc; which body he holding in his hand, utters these words (<HI>hoc est corpus meum</HI>) that is <HI>corpus meum est corpus meum,</HI> a mere I|dentical trifleing proposition, which according to all Logick is most absurd, and destroys the ve|ry nature of a Sacrament, which consists of two essential parts the sign and the thing signified; besides they of Rome con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ess that the Body of Christ, is not present under the species of Bread and Wine, when the Preist begins to pronounce (<HI>hoc</HI>) nor till he hath uttered the last sillable (<HI>um) hoc est corpus meum,</HI> such poore shifts these men are forced to use.</P>
<P>As for antiquity, so much boasted of by those of Rome, I know that some of the fathers to draw mens minds from the earthly elements to heavenly misteries, used now and then high Rhetoricall expressions, never dreaming of any substantiall change of the elements into the Bo|dy and Bloud of Christ, as is evident from Irae|neus, <HI>Panis Communis post consecrationem, non est amplius panis communis, sed efficitur Eucharistia, quae constat ex duabus naturis ter|ren&acirc; &amp; cael<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sti, haec oblatio <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st figura corporis &amp; sanguinis Christi.</HI> Ambrose 1. ad Cor.

<P>In a word the ancient fathers, who opposed the Eutychian haeresy, did make use of the sacra|mentall union of Bread and Wine, to the body and blood of Christ, shewing that the humane nature of Christ is not more changed into the divine then the Sacramentall Bread and Wine is into the very Body and Blood of Christ, therefore they believed no such thing, as that monstrous Po|pish transubstantiation.</P>
<P>So that we see the falsity and absurdity of it by Scripture, antiquity, common sence and reason; besides the great danger of Idolatry, in worshipping a piece of bread, if there be no transubstantiation, as some of the papists them|selves confesse, and they also acknowledge, that if the Priest, that consecrates were not rightly ordained, or that he did not actually intend to consecrate, or that he omitted any one Cere|mony (which they call necessary) at the time of consecration, that the Bread and Wine are not duely Consecrated, and consequently no transubstantiation, and therefore great proba|bility, that the Papists in worshipping the

host, do frequently comitt the very great Sin of Idolatry, which was to me one great reason of forsaking their Communion.</P>

<P>Our Blessed Saviour at the instituition of the Sacrament commands, drinke yee all of this, whereas at the giveing of the bread, he said on|ly, take, Eate, foreseeing and obviating this grand error of the Church of Rome; 'tis true the persons then communicating, were only his disciples, which had received their Commissio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to preach the Gospell, before that time, but not in that ample and full manner, as they re|ceived it after his Resurection, as is plain from <HI>Iohn</HI> 20, 22, 23. and <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t.</HI> 28, 29. but be it granted that they were all in full orders, and upon that account the Cup was given them, otherwise they should not have received it, by the same reason the bread might be denyed to the people, because none but Priests did then Communicate; but we know that a Priest when he doth not consecrate, is in the place of a Lay|man, and consequently the disciples not con|secrating at the Supper were no better, and
<PB N="77" REF="42">
therefore according to the doctrine, and practise of the Church of Rome, should not have received the Cup.</P>
<P>But what will they thinke of the whole Church of Corinth, to whom St. <HI>Paul</HI> sent a first and second Epistle, they cannot imagine they were all Priests, observe then how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">xhorts all of them, to examine themselves in order to the receiving of the holy Eucharist under both kinds. 1. <HI>Cor</HI> 11. this is so evi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent that our adve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">saries have nothing to Reply.</P>

<P>You rightly Judge, and were their fancy of Transubstantiation true (as nothing is more false and ridiculous) yet were it not suffici|ent to debar the Laity of the Cup, because they receive the Blood of Christ with his Body, for this is not to drinke but to eat it, and besides the Sacrament is not a sign of his Blood in the veins, but as 'twas shed and powred out; might not the Preists as well receive his Blood, with his Body, and then 'twere as superfluous for them to drin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of the Cup, as for the people; but I pray proceed in your reasons against Po|pery.</P>

<P>My third reason is taken from the invo|cation of Saints departed; which is against Scrip|ture, and antiquity: 'tis an attribute belonging to God alone, <HI>that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he is a God hearing Prayers.</HI> 'Tis a chiefe part of his worship, <HI>thou shalt Wor|ship the Lord thy God, and him o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ely shalt thou Serve,</HI> it robs Christ of one part of his Preistly office who now sitts at Gods right hand, inter|ceding

<P>Besides the worship of Angells is forbidden by St. <HI>Paul. Col.</HI> 2. and the Angell in the Reve|lation twice sorbade St. <HI>Iohn</HI> to worship him, <HI>Cap.</HI> 19. and 22 yea the worshippers of An|gells were in the primitive times, branded with the title of haereticks, under the name of (An|gelici) and therefore much less ought wee to worship the Saints departed, for certainely they being the more excellent Creatures, are much more capable of such worship then the soules of men, that are now in <HI>Abrahams</HI> bosome, in Paradise, not yet in that perfect bliss and glory, which they shall enjoy when their soules and bo|dies shall be reunited, but according to many of the fathers in a certaine and joyfull expectancy of it, after the last and finall judgment, where the place of their present abode is I shall tell you when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he fathers are agreed about it.</P>

<P>I shall submit to your advice, and pro|ceed to a fourth reason against Popery, which is their adoration of images so much condemned in holy Scripture, what more expressly forbiden then image worship by the second Commande|ment? which they of Rome have Cunningly left out in their mass books, offices, Primmers, and Catechism's, and without all shew of Rea|son, asserted it to be a positive Command, belonging onely to the Jews, how demonstra|tively
<PB N="81" REF="44">
is the fourth of Deutronomie against it from the 12 <HI>verse</HI> to the 18? many other texts might be urged to the same purpose, all which the Schoolmen endeavour to baffle, by their Pitti|full distinctions; betwixt an Image and an Idol, a picture upon a cloath and one ingraven in wood, or stone, betwixt <GAP DESC="foreign"> &amp; <GAP DESC="foreign"> which every <HI>Esurient Groeculus</HI>; every mean <HI>Sciolist,</HI> will smile at, betwixt <HI>Mediat&egrave;, Relutiv&egrave;,</HI> and <HI>Ter|minative,</HI> which a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e distinctions (at least some of them) without a difference, mere Chimericall phansies: if a man shall seriously peruse the 13&punc; and 14. <HI>Chapters</HI> of the Book of <HI>Wisdome</HI> (which at Rome is Canonicall Scripture) and consider what answers the <HI>Heathens</HI> returned to those that objected against them their Idol worship,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Non imagi|ni, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d nu|mini sacri|ficamus. Ae</HI></NOTE> that they worship not the Image, but the (<HI>Nu|men</HI>) or divine power it represented, he will easily discern that the wiser sort of <HI>Heathens</HI> made as wise <HI>Appologies,</HI> for their Image worship; as the wisest Papists do for theirs.</P>
<P>As for the antiquity of this grosse superstition both Fathers &amp; Councels are against it, as is evident from that excellent Homily of our Church con|cerning the perill of Idolatry, if it be replyed twere the images of the heathens they opposed, true 'tis, for in the first ages of the Church there were no others, the Christians of those times, abominateing all image worship, but the rea|sons they give against the heathen Imagery wound the Church of Rome under the fifth rib; no Christian Church did then use images in their
<PB N="82" REF="45">
oratoryes; in after ages they were admitted on|ly for an historicall use, as may be seen in <HI>St Gregories</HI> writings, who lived above 600 years after Christ, true 'tis by the Second Nicene Councell their worship was decreed; and so this iniquity was established by a law, such a one as that packed convention could legitimate, and hence forward not only the pictures of Saints, but of God himself and of the Blessed Trinity were set up in Churches, which was an high dishonour to the Glorious Majesty of the Almighty, to be portraid like an old Man, and gave an occasion to ignorant people to conceive him to be so in|deed, hence I have heard some of them say, when they swore (<HI>by God</HI>) that they swore by a good Man, by which 'tis evident, how the grosse su|perstition of the Church of Rome, hath croo|ked silly Souls, and that all such images, <HI>are teachers of Lies,</HI> very vanities, as the Scripture shews and reason demonstrates.</P>
<P>For to say nothing of the Blasphemous images of God the Father, and the holy Trinity, doth not the image of any Saint, whom these pseudo-Catholicks worship, lie to their imaginations? re|presenting that which is not; for nothing but the Soules, and Spirits of those Saints do now re|main, so that whilest they picture and worship them in bodily shapes, which pictures represent, what is not, they worship they know not what, praying onely to the Soules of Saints, yet phan|sying them in bodily shapes as when they lived here on earth: how doth it concern all Serious
<PB N="83" REF="45">
Christians, to beware of the Religious worship of any creature of Gods or mans makeing? of Angell, Saint, or Image, which is so expres|sly forbidden in the word of God? And surely if we might worship the picture of a man, which is mans Creature, 'twere much more rational to worship a true man, yea the Son, Moon and Starrs, and all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> host of heaven, they being all of them the Creatures of Almighty God.</P>

<P>I might here add the vain Reptitions, of so many <HI>Ave-Maria's, &amp; Pater-noster's,</HI> upon their beads, their saying of them at certain houres as a <HI>Pensum,</HI> or taske, or a Pennance to make a Compensation for their sins, rather then as a willing serious duty from the heart and soule; which is not Religious praying, but a Childish saying of prayers, a vain heathenish babling, after the manner of an old wises charm; resting in the work done; as if the bare saying of pray|ers, without any intention of the mind, were the only end of praying, or the effectuall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> prayer of a Righteous man. <HI>Iam.</HI> 5.16.</P>

<P>I am fully perswaded, that the paying of Tiths is no oppression or injury to any man; but the Independents, and other Sectaries imagine that Tiths are a Levitical maintenance, and there|fore to be abrogated under the Gospel; that Mi|nisters now are to be maintain'd by a voluntary Contribution, or at best to have a set stipend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>That Tiths received not their begin|ning from the Levitical Law, is evident to any unbyased judgment, from the example of <HI>Abra|hams</HI> paying them to <HI>Melchisedeck</HI>; of <HI>Iacobs</HI> vowing to give the Tenth of all that the Lord should bless him with; from the Apostles large discourse about <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Melchisedeck,</HI> Heb. 7.

<P>As to that of Stipend and Voluntary Contribu|tion, 'tis a meer plot of the Devil, and Popish Emissaries, to render Ministers contemptible, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aking them Stipendiaries, or Eleemosynaries,

<P>That any gifted Brother any one that per|swades himself that he has the Spirit, and through a strong imagination conceives himself fit to Speak in the Congregation, may without any farther tryal, or lawfull call take upon him the office of Publick Preaching and Ministring in the Con|gregation (which is the most sacred and weighty of of all other) This is nothing less then a presump|tuous usruping of the Priests office.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>That you shall most willingly. And here|in my judgment is that this is one of the most wild and Fanatick opinions, that ever entred into the minds of men; that it opens a wide gap to all Schisms and Heresies, a certain cause of all manner of disorder and confusions in the Church: upon this account, Priests and Jesuits, and all manner
<PB N="114" REF="61">
of Sectaries, have had so fair an opp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rtunity to vent their poysonous Tenents in the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Indepen|dent Congregations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am fully perswaded that Shisms and Heresies are the necessary consequents of mens invading the Ministry without regular Ordinati|on. But for my better satisfaction, I pray you let me understand the reasons that make against this Independent practise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Reasons are these; drawn</P>
<P>First from plain Scripture, as <HI>Ierem.</HI> 14.14. and 23.21. where there is a complaint against those Prophets <HI>That Prophesied lyes in Gods name, and he sent them not.</HI> And again the same Prophet, <HI>I have not sent these Prophets, and yet they ran; I have not spoken unto them, and yet they Prophesied, therefore they shall not profit these people at all.</HI></P>
<P>Neither was this Sending and Calling a necessa|ry requisite only under the Law, but also in the time of the Gospel. The first that were ever call|ed and sent to preach the glad tidings of the king|dom of Heaven, were the Apostles, who were first Disciples to the best of Masters, before they were sent out to Preach. First Qualified fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the work, and then Sent. So upon the trea|son and death of <HI>Iudas, Matthias</HI> was made an Apostle in his place, but by Election and Ordina|tion. <HI>Acts</HI> 1. <HI>Heb.</HI> 5. <HI>No man must take this hono<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> upon him but he that is called of God</HI>; either im|mediately, or by the Governors of the Church; and hereupon it was that St. <HI>Paul</HI> left <HI>Timothy</HI> at
<PB N="115" REF="61">
<HI>Ephesus,</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> at <HI>Creete, to Ordain Elders in every Citty,</HI> instructing them how the Priests and Deacons ought to be qualified.</P>
<P>'Tis well worth our observation how the A|postle makes the salvation of men to depend or|dinarily upon the Preaching of Sent and Called Ministers; <HI>Rom.</HI> 10. <HI>Whosoever calleth upon th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> name of the Lord he shall be saved</HI>; but such Call|ing presupposeth Believing, Hearing, Preaching, Sending; how shall they Preach, except they be sent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis evident by the Scriptures, both of the Old and New Testament: That no man ought to take upon him the Office of a Minister, before he has a lawful Call from the Church, or can by working Miracles make it appear, that he is immediately called from God, which is not now to be expected.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>And 'tis as evident from the practise of the Church from the time of the Apostles, even to this present age; for he that shall peruse her Records shall find that whosoever did presume to take upon himself the office of publick Preaching, or Administation of the Sacraments, without an extraordinary Call, arrested by Miracles, or an or|dinary one from the Governors of the Church, was ever accounted a Theif and a Robber, no true Shephard that entred in at the Church door, but crept in, or climb'd up some other way.</P>
<P>And hereupon <HI>Tertullian</HI> complains, That in their Heretical Conventicles <HI>their Women were
<PB N="116" REF="62">
bold pratlers, they did preach, dispute, baptize</HI>; meer Laicks; did usurp the Priests office, by which means, <HI>instead of converting Heathens, they did per|vert Christians.</HI> St. <HI>Hierom</HI> also in an Epistle to <HI>Paulinus,</HI> complains, <HI>That every one did presume to interpret holy Scripture; prating old women, doting old men, Husbandmen, Masons, Iacks of all trades</HI>; even as it has been in this divided Nation; Trades-men, Shoemakers, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oblers, Glovers, Taylors, have skip'd from the Shop to the Pulpit, and have left stitching of graments, to make a rent in the Church.</P>

<P>I shall mos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> willingly give in my an|swer to those exceptions, in that order you have ranked them. Therefore in the first place, let me hear what you can object against our Bishops.</P>

<P>True 'tis, such dirt has been cast upon that Sacred Order by ignorant and discontented persons; such an one was <HI>Aerius</HI> the first Anti-Episcopal man we read of; but this groundless o|pinion is abundantly confuted by the Testimony of holy Scripture, by the practise of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">niversal Church; attested by the general consent of Fa|thers and Councels, as you may see in Dr. <HI>Ham|mond</HI>'s book against <HI>Blondel</HI>; Dr. <HI>Taylor</HI>'s treatise <HI>of the Divine right of Episcopacy,</HI> with many o|thers.</P>
<P>First, The Scripture is clean for differrent Orders in the Clergy.

<P>I am very well perswaded, by what you have said, that the Primitive goverment of the Church, was by Bishops, with the assistance of the Presbyterie, who had authority over the Presbyters, and were their superiors. But I pray you satisfie me in this one thing. Why did St. <HI>Paul</HI> so sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rply reprove the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> for not excommunicating the Incestuous Person, if they had no authority so to do without a Bishop?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>This at the first sight seems to be a very smart objection: but if we seriously consider the words upon which 'tis grounded, it has no weight at all.

a sin, not for the neglect of Excommunication. He that had committed that great sin, was to be taken away, or cut off from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hurch, but they them|selves could not exclude him, but this was to be done by the Spirit of St. <HI>Paul, verse</HI> 3, 4. in whom the power of Jurisdiction was originally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eated; there being then no Bishop of <HI>Corinth</HI>; for evident it is, that in those Churches, where there were no Bishops, the Apostles kept the power of Jurisdiction in their own hands, until Bishops were setled among them, as is manifest in the Churches of <HI>Ephesus</HI> and <HI>Creet.</HI> Neither can it ever be proved that Bresbyters (as such) had any Juris|diction belonging to the publick goverment of the Church, but by particular Substitution and De|legation from the Apostles, and Bishops, and no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by virtue of their own Order.</P>

<P>You may think these are such knots

which admit of no easy solution; but I shall pre|sently make you understand the contrary.</P>
<P>First, I shall shew you that Cathedrals, Deans and Chapters, (though not under those names) were from the beginning of Christianity. It is clear from the Acts of the Apostles, and the Re|cords of the Church, that the Apostles and Disci|ples of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ (those spiritual Fishermen) cast in their nets where they were like to make the greatest and most advantegi|ous draughts. They usually Preached in the most Populous Citys, where they established Churches which anon after were called Mother-Churches, to which the Suburbican, or those that dwelt in the adjacent Villages were subject, and with the Mo|ther-Churches made up the Bishops Diocess, which they governed (as St.<HI>Hirome</HI> confesses) by the common councel and assistance of Presbiters, termed at <HI>Rome</HI> in after times <HI>Cardinals,</HI> or chief Presbiters, and in the time of <HI>Charles</HI> the great (as the <HI>Magdeburgenses</HI> inform us) were in|corpated into a Colledge under the name of Dem and Chapter; the Dean by the Canon-law being called <HI>Arch-Presbiter.</HI> Before the sounding of Universsitys, these Cathedrals were the Schools of the Prophets, where young Students were train'd up in the Study of Divinity and other good learn|ing; <HI>Gerard</HI> gives us a tast of their first institution, their corruption, and how they might be restored to their primitive uses.

The abuses ought to be taken away; I am as much for a refor|mation as any man, but not for an extirpation.</P>
<P>If Bishops, Deans, and Chapters, do not joyn together in the Goverment of the Church, 'tis the fault of their Persons not of their Institution. Deans and Canons ought to be of Councel to the
<PB N="125" REF="66">
Bishop in a subordinate way; not to have cordi|nate power and Authority with him. If they are too much guilty of non-residence, (as it cannot be denyed but that many of them are,) this ought to be reformd by Mulcts and Punishments, but espe|cially by those that have the power of collating those dignities, that they do not confer them upon any person that lives out of the Diocess, or at too great a distance from the Cathedral, which is a very great abuse and wants Reformation. As for the keeping of Hospitality, the cavil is just the same which the <HI>Egiptyans</HI> had against the <HI>Isralits,</HI> for not fulfilling their tale of Brick, when they deny|ed them straw to make it. Sacrilegious hands have Robbed Cathedrals of many of their rich Mannors, and how should it be possible for Deans and Pre|bends to maintain that Hospitality which their Predecessors heretofore have kept. I know a Canon, of one of the most Auntient Cathedrals in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> that his necessary expences in his Residence, &amp; journeys, being deducted, did not receive <HI>de claro</HI> five pounds yearly, for seven years in twelve. Now according to the law of God and nature, Families, Wives, and Children must be provided for; and how can such necessary provision and any conside|rable Hospitality stand together, out of an Hundred Marks or an Hundred Pounds of yeary Income; which is more then some Cathedral Residentaries do receive to my knowledge? I wish that those of the Gentry who have their Thousands of yearly Revenues would forbear their squandring away of their Rich Patrymonies in vanities and very sinful courses, that they would keep Hospitality and Re|sidence, upon their own Rich Mannors, amongst
<PB N="126" REF="67">
their poor Tenants and Neighbours who eat the Bread of carefulness, and then they might with greater confidence c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vil at the non-residence and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt of Hospitality in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lergy. The best way to pull out the Moth which they discover in the Churches eye, is first of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll to cast out the Beam which is in their own eye.</P>
<P>Second, Whereas you object, that Cathedral dig|nities are made subservient to the pride and luxu|ry of the Idle and lazy Ministers; my reply shall be very short. If any such be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rept into such places I shall not be their advocate, but be ready to throw the first Stone at them. But I pray you do not cast such dirt upon those who have laboured in the word and doctrine, but esteem them worthy of double honor, however the infirmities of old age, have now seized upon them; dimness of sight, weakness of memory, an hoarse voice, and feeble lungs. If these Cathedral perferments be great en|couragements to younger men, (which none but Fools and Sacrilegious persons will deny:) VVhy may not such places, be as so many Ecclesiasti|cal Hospitals for these (<HI>Milites emiriti</HI>) old souldiers of Jesus Christ? who have war'd a good warfare, and though now they are less able to teach in the Pulpit, yet may they instruct out of it, by their grave and exemplary lives, and sage coun|cels. 1. <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.17. <HI>Let the Elders that rule well</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign"> not <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>be worthy of double ho|nor.</HI></P>

<P>This exception cannot totally be avoid|ed; yet Cathedrals are not so much in fault as the Supream power of the land, which took away their rich Mannors, and gave them in their stead lean and scandalous Impropriations, which (as some say) was done in policy to prevent their to|tal abolition, which fate Abbies and Priories had lately sufferred under; for those rich Mannors being exchanged for poor Impropriations, Cathe|drals were not now so sweet and lushious morsels to sacrilegious palates.</P>

<P>At his Majesties happy Restauration, there was a fair opportunity which offerred it self, the like we cannot expect. How easie had it been then to have setled a competent maintenance upon most Churches in the Nation? Some augmenta|tions by his Majesties appointment were then made, I wish there had been more: I know no other way to redress this grievance, but by annex|ing some Prebends unto the Vicaridges of these Impropriated Churches, which might be done in Cathedrals of the old Foundation, where there
<PB N="128" REF="68">
are minor Prebendaries distinct from Residentia|ries, mean while those Parochial Churches are sup|plyed mostly by the Vicars Choral, whose mainte|nance from their Colledge and privy Tithes, re|ceived from those Churches where they serve, is not contemptible. I wish 'twere better, and that some of them, by their industry and conscientious diligence in their Ministry did deserve a better subsistance, at which wish no man can take excep|tions, but he that is guilty of ignorance or negli|gence in the duty of his calling, which is his fault in being so, and not mine in wishing it should be otherwise.</P>

<P>The Lord put it into their hearts, to undertake so good and pious a work. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et me now hear what you can answer to what is objected against the Lives a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Conversations of Vicars Choral, Petty Canons, Singing-men, as they are setled in some Cathedrals.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Eiru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>My answer is, That the charge is too general, and favours of want of Charity. That some of them may be such, whose conversation is not so commendable as it should be, or that they have not that sense and relish of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eligion, which ought to be in men of that Place and Call|ing, I fear may too justly be charged upon them; but much of this dirt might be wiped off by the constant Residence, grave Example, and strict Di|scipline of those to whom the goverment of the Church belongs. 'Tis confessed, that through the corruption of our natures, the best duties, fre|quently perform'd, are apt to degenerate into cold and airy formalities.</P>
<P>'Tis the great happiness of those Christians which dwel near Cathedrals, that they may meet Three t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mes a day, Evening, Morning, and Noon, to offer up prayer and praises to the High and Holy God; but 'tis very much to be lamented,
<PB N="130" REF="69">
that Cittizens, and others, not hindred by neces|sarie occasions, should be so frequently absent from these solemn Assemblies, as usually they are. It is yet more to be lamented, that those whose du|ty it is to officiate at those solemn services should look upon them as a (<HI>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nsum,</HI>) a task, a burden; as naughty boyes at school do their lessons; how far are such stupid souls from holy <HI>David</HI>'s zeal and piety. <HI>One thing</HI> (saith that good King&punc; <HI>Psal.</HI> 22.4.) <HI>have I desired of the Lord, which I shall seek after, that I may dwel in the house of the Lord all the daies of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his Temple.</HI></P>
<P>Want of sense &amp; zeal at holy Offices, is not the fault of Chore, or Quire service, but of those that Officiate; who if they will seriously fix their hearts upon those holy duties, when they sing and give praise, as <HI>David</HI> did, attending to the matter of their heavenly and ravishing Anthems, as well as to the Musick, they would not look <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pon the ser|vice as a burden, but as a blessed opportunity thus to praise Almighty God in the beauty of Holy|ness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Happily it might be so to those who un|derstood those Anthems, but I have heard some say, that the singing in Chores is to them much like a Latine service, they knowing not what is sung.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is your Fift Exception, and 'tis indeed a very weak one; there being none who frequent this service, but know very well what is sung, (unless it be the full Anthem:) let those
<PB N="131" REF="69">
that make this objection, frequent this service, and then they will be ashamed of so frivelous a Cavile, and easily perceive the fault to have been in themselves, and not in the service.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is one exception yet behind a|gainst your Chore service; as the use of Musicall Instruments, in the performance of a great part of it, which are said to be <HI>Levitical,</HI> and there|fore unlawful under the Gospel, as we have seen in the <HI>Geneva</HI> Notes upon the last <HI>Psalm,</HI> as also in <HI>Aquinas, Quest.</HI> 22.9, 19. and divers other Learned Men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a very gross mistake; for Musical Instruments are not part of the <HI>Levitical</HI> law, never instituted by <HI>Moses,</HI> who was so faithful a servant in his trust that he would not have omitted to enjoyn them, had they been given him in Charge by All|mighty God. They were in use long before <HI>Moses,</HI> presently after the Creation of the world, for <HI>Gen.</HI> 4. we read that the rare gift of playing on Musical Instruments was given to <HI>Iubal.</HI> Can we imagine that such a gift was bestowed on him to Stir up wantonness and lust, by the more artificial singing, of unsavory Sonnets? Or is it not more rational to conceive that this skil in Musick was given to men to Sing forth the Praises of our great Creator in a more excellent manner? <HI>When we Glorify the Lord we ought to exalt him as much as we can</HI>: Ec|clesiasticus. 43.30. And surely if Musick has a natural influence upon our affections to Stir up and quicken them in wantoness and daliance, cer|tainly it may work the same effect, upon them to
<PB N="132" REF="70">
quicken and enliven them in a more devout and intensive Praising of Almighty God in all those that have a Religious tendency, and a serious disposition to his worship and service; besides seing 'tis a moral and perpetual duty, to shew forth the Praises of God, all rational men will consent that this ought to be performed after the best manner, and consequently with such skil and are that has the greatest influence upon our affecti|ons, rather then after such a manner which renders the service of God mean and contemptible as 'tis rendred in many of our Parochial Churches.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have fully satisfied me that Musical Instruments in the service of God are not Levi|tical, but are natural means to Stir up the affecti|ons in these sacred Hyms and Anthems. Never|theless I have heard that many who are much tak|en with Chore Anthems, are much offended at the manner of reading of Prayers in Cathedrals; when they pray for the Sick, they use the ordinary tone which is used in Parish Churches, at other times they pronounce their Prayers in a middle way be|tween Reading and Singing. Which seems to be not so grave and sutable to the Solemnity of Pray|er.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess this is a common objection, and some that are no enimies to Cathedral service have in this much desired a reformation, but this must be left to the prudence of those that set at the Serne; mean while we ought not to condemn the Quire|service for this seeming indecency, well knowing that the stress of Religious duties does not consist
<PB N="133" REF="70">
in the toning and modulation of the voice but in the Musick of the heart and affections, in a serious and devout fixing of the mind upon the things that are Read or Sung, the want of which, in those who Read Prayers or Sing Anthems, is no little sin, and one main reason why some of our Singing-men are not so seriously devout as they ought to be, &amp; real|ly those that are frequently present, officiating in holy duties unpreparedly, carelessly, formally, and irreverently, by Gods just judgment may be given up to a senceless stupidity, for their prophanation of the holy ordinances of God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis certain, that a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">prophane carless per|forming of Divine service is a very great sin, and a necessary cause of irreligion and practical A|theism, one exception I had allmost forgott which concerns Choristers, who are said to be, for the most part, very untoward Children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>First, This cannot be denyed, but the reasons are first, negligence in the Musick Masters, whose chiefest care it is to teach them to Sing, and the end why they Sing: namely to set forth the Praises of their Creator&punc; neither are they so careful to instruct them how to behave them|selves reverently and devoutly at the worship and service of God.</P>
<P>Secondly, Some of them are not set to the Grammer School, where upon they squander away a great part of their time in vain sports, and idle|ness which is the Mother of all villany and wick|ednss.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="71">Thirdly. But the chiefest reason of all is that our Choristers are commonly the Children o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mean Parents, who for the most part are very ig|norant in the great matters of Religion, and ex|treamly negligent in the concerns of their own and their Childrens Souls; Now Deans and Chapters are necessitated to make choise of such poor Children, because the better sort of people, disdain to have their Children brought up in that noble Science of Musick, which is their gross ig|norance; besides their scorn and contempt of this Science, they misconceive that if they should send them to the Musick School it would hinder them in their Grammer learning, which might easily be prevented by imploying those hours only at Musick which are spent in foolish, insignificant sports and pastimes, which as I am inform'd, is the practise in some places beyond Sea; where their youths spend much of the afternoons in Musick and Dancing, Training, Mathematicks, and such like manly and profitable exercises, which conduce both to the health of the body, and benefit of the understanding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>I perceive that those exceptions against Deans and Chapters and Cathedral service are not so substantial, as once I conceived them to be. If you please, we will now proceed to those which I have heard urged with much earnestness against <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et forms of Prayer, and in particular against the Liturgie of the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most willingly, I pray you favour me with the recital of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="135" REF="71">
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Twould be to much trouble and to lit|tle purpose to mention all that I have heard, se|ing many of them are very frivolous and not wor|thy of a serious answer, those that seem to be the most material, are, First that they are imposed by mans Authority. Secondly, they stint the Spirit. Thirdly they are cold and dead forms, our Spirits are not affected, and quickned by them, as by con|ceived and extemporary Prayers&punc;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>First, whatsoever is imposed upon us by mans Authority contrary to the word of God is utterly unlawfull, but set Forms taken out of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ods word, are not contrary to that word, especially when not only the very matter of them is con|tained in Holy Scripture, but the very words and phrase. 'Tis a strange peice of nonsence that what is in it self lawfull and laudable should cease to be so, because 'tis commanded by our Superiors. True indeed, that things in themselves lawfull (be|ing in their own nature but indifferent) if com|manded as necessary and intrinsically holy, are upon that account unlawfull and repugnant to Christi|an liberty; but more of this when we shall di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|course about&punc; Ceremonies.</P>
<P>Secondly, That the Spirit is stinted by a set Form; and that Reading of Prayers out of a Book, cannot be praying by the Spirit.</P>
<P>To this I reply, That if their were any truth in these exceptions, how comes it to pass that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e have so many set Forms of Prayer, and thanks|giving in Holy Scripture? How do set form<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="136" REF="72">
of Prayer more stint the Spirit, then set Forms of <HI>Psalms</HI> for Singing? Yea; does a set Form of Prayer more stint the Spirit then the extempo|rary conceptions of the Minister limit and stint the Spirit of the Congregation, to whom they are upon this account in the nature of set Forms? When these queries shall be rationally answered, I shall through away all set Forms which have been used by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hristian Churches for above 1400 years. Besides those of the Presbyterian perswasion allow'd them as lawfull in their confe|rences with the Bishops anon after his Majesties restauration.</P>
<P>As to the other part of the other exception that reading of Prayers out of a Book cannot be pray|ing by the Spirit; this to those who understand the true meaning of that Phrase is a most frivilous cavill; for setting aside the extraordnary gift of prayer, to pray in, or by, the Spirit denotes first the making of our prayers according to the mind of the Spirit exprest in the Scripture, as may appear <HI>Col.</HI> 3.16. Secondly, to pray by the Spirit, is to pray by that principle of grace wrought in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, and enabling us to every good duty, as well as to prayer. Thirdly to pray by the Spirit is when the Spirit do's stir up our hearts to this Holy duty, working in us good desires, and motions, quickning our faith and fervency, whereby our hearts minds &amp; spirits go along with out Tongues and Words, utterd either in a set Form or by our extemporary expressions, which is usually practized by knowing Christians in their Closset devotions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="137" REF="72">
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess I am not able to shew why set Forms of Prayer should stint the Spirit, more then set forms of Singing, and I am perswaded that praying by the Spirit, signifies no more then the assistance of the holy Spirit quickning and stirring us up to, and in, Prayer; whereby our hearts and spirits are fixed in that holy duty joyning and going along with the Tongue and Voice, but truly I find by experience that my Spirit is more stirred up by a Prayer that is new, which I never heard before, being lively deliver'd, then by a common Form read out of a Book.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is the chiefest reason <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hich ren|ders men such admirers of extemporary Prayers, and so opposite to set forms; their own experi|ence tels them that they are more taken with such Prayers then with common Forms read out of a Book; whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h phanciful experience no wise man will plead against reason and judgment, it being very deceitful and the issue of a very common corruption, and humane infirmity, which inclines us to be more taken with what is new, then with what we have often heard, especially when 'tis deliver'd in a lively tone, with pleasing actions and gesticulations of the Body, and without Book, though for substance, and soundness, what is read be infinitely before it.</P>
<P>Pray Sir, answer me but this one question; whether are your affections more stir'd up at the reading of some portion of Scripture by the Minister, or at a good Sermon, delivered from the Pulpit?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="138" REF="73">
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess I am much more affected, my affections are more wrought upon by a good Ser|mon deliver'd with life and action then at the rea|ding of the best Chapter in the Bible.</P>

<P>I believe you, yet you will not say that the best Sermon that ever was made by man, is to be prefer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> before a portion of sacred Scri|pture.

<P>You see by this one instance, how fallible your own phantiful experience has been, and how it has lead you against Scripture, against the ge|neral practise of the Church, against all sober rea|son, so dangerous a thing it is for men of short discourse, that are not masters of reason, but are guided to phansies, over powred by passions, en|gaged in parties to meddle with controversies, which are too high and hard for them.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confesse that 'twas no great wonder, that so mean a man as I should be mistaken, but 'tis ve|ry strange, that so many grave and learned men as were in the late Assembly, should be so much a|gainst the Common Prayer Book of the Church of England, which I have heard learned men af|firme to be the best Liturgie in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Twas very strange that so many learned men, should be overborn by some leading men, that had more zeal than judgm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt, and happily more of
<PB N="139" REF="73">
interest and designe then of learning and piety&punc; but as there have been Parliament-drivers, so there have been Assembly-drivers, and Convocation-dri|vers, before you or I were born, and will be after we are in our graves. And I am confident, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> disg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ised Priests and Jesuits have had more then one finger, in animating the Presbiterians, against the Church of England, as well as (to my know|ledge) they have had in somenting Anabaptisme&punc; and Quaquerisme, so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 'tis their Maxime, <HI>divide &amp; impera,</HI> divide the Hereticks, and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e shall Reign.</P>
<P>I have more charity then to believe that the Assembly (the greatest part of them) were of opi|nion that set Forms of Prayer were either useless, or unlawful, though they cannot be excused from too much compliance (I fear) against their own judgments. They could not be ignorant that the vote against the Book of Common-Prayer was contrary to the sentiments of the most learned men in all the Reformed Churches beyond Sea, of very sober men in this Nation, (known hereto|fore by the name of Puritans) the most discreet and moderate of that Party were never against set forms; of the Reverend Bishops of the Church of England; many of which sacred order have bee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as famous in their generation, both for learn|ing and piety as former ages ever knew; yea since His Majesties happy Restauration, the chiefest of the Presbiterian perswasion, have acknow|ledged set forms of Prayer in publick to be law|ful, they plainly confess in their Conference with the Bishops they are not against them; but every
<PB N="140" REF="74">
daies experience will make it evident, they must be for them, as well as not against them, unles<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the late Assembly, could have as easily voted, and made all Ministers of the Church of England, Discreet, Judicious, Orthodox, and of a ready Elo|cution, as they did rashly and inconsiderately, vote down the Liturgie.</P>
<P>Besides the Congregation, especially the weak|er sort, those t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">at are ignorant, and cannot read, may better joyn in prayer, when the Forms of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> are known and common, then they can in strange <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd extemporary expressions, with which they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ltogether unacqainted; which being the pra|ctise in the late ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es of confusion, has taught the people only to hear prayers, as if they were so many Sermons, wherein they were not at all con|cerned to joyn with their hearts and tongues, and to say <HI>Amen</HI>; or as if the ear were the only mem|ber to be imployed in that holy duty.</P>
<P>Again, Set and prescribed Forms, consisting of Scriptural phrases and expressions, unaffected and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tted to the understanding of the meanest c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">paci|tie, are <HI>soonest received into the heart, and aptest to excite and carry along with them judicious and steady <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ffections,</HI> as King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> observed in his most excellent Book. Hereunto may be added, That out of well composed Forms, the weaker Christians may be furnished with a stock of whole|some expressions, composed by the advice, &amp; joynt sistance of the cheif Pastors and Ministers of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Church, for their help and direction in their private Devotions, which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> imposible to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> done
<PB N="141" REF="74">
by the suddain, various, uncertain expressions of divers particular Ministers.</P>
<P>Besides, Set Forms are necessary for uniformi|ty in the publick worship; and upon this account learned and sober men have wished there were but one publick Liturgie in all Christian Churches in the world; which (if it were possible) would be a great means of peace and unity amongst Christians, by preventing the spreading of Schisms and Heresies, that may be as well prayed up as preached up; as also undecent, unscriptural ex|pressions, tautologies, vain-repetitions, phanta|stical affected words and phrases, utterly abhorrent from the sobriety and gravity of Divine Oratory, which is quite another thing from that of the Stage or Desk.</P>
<P>Lastly, Should we deal with an understanding Recusant, endeavouring to perswade him to for|sake his superstitious worship, and to joyn him|self to our Assemblies; how could we assure him (if we have no publick established Liturgie) that our way and manner of worship is, and shall conti|nue Scripture-proof, sound and innocent, without errours and indecencies? Do we think that any wise man, would leave his Popish blind way of worship, to be guided by our dark Lanthorn; not being rationaly assured, after what way we do wor|ship the God of our Fathers? which we cannot sa|tisfie him in, if we have no set Liturgie.</P>

<P>You must give me leave to adde Two things more in answer to that argument drawn from Experience, and then we will discourse of those exceptions against our Common-Player in particular.</P>
<P N="1">1. I will oppose experience to experience, those that repro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch our Common-prayer, for a cold and dry Service, extolling extemporary con|ceptions so much beyond it; let these men make this easie experiment to themselves. Let them take some of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> best of extemporary prayers <HI>verbatim,</HI> which your Short-hand-writers can exactly do, let these prayers be read or repeated <HI>memoriter,</HI> with all the advantages of pleasing tones, bodily gesticulations, lively pronunciations, and assure your self they will at length appear to be as dull, dry and cold as any part of our Liturgie.</P>
<P N="2">2. I would have you seriously consider what the most judiceous <HI>Hooker</HI> sayes concerning Ser|mons, and Reading of Scripture; why the former are so highly esteem'd and the other so much slighted; the truth <HI>is, they please more then Lessons and Chapters by reason of those outward advanta|ges which a Sermon well delivered has above th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Scripture barely read; besides the singular attention and affection which men are apt to express toward the one, and their cold disposition toward the other; part|ly because 'tis usual to let those things pass carelesly
<PB N="143" REF="75">
by our ears which we have often heard before or, know we may haer again when ever we please; and part|ly for that Sermons are new and fresh, and if they slip by us for the present, what excellencies soever they contain is lost, which creats the grater atte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ion, which causes the greater affections</HI>: so far that wor|thy man. This certainly is one great reason why set Forms of Prayer are so much undervalued in respect of extemporary and conceiv'd effusions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am abundantly satisfied, that set Forms of Prayer are not only lawfull, but very use|full in the Publike Service of the Church. I shall now by your good leave descend to those excepti|ons which are made more particularly against the Liturgie of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> First, that 'tis taken out of the Masse Book. Secondly that it contains many shreds of Prayer, which are short and customary wishes, rather then serious and devout Prayers. Thirdly, that it appoints di|vers Apocryphal Chapters to be publikly read, which contain things incredible and ridiculous. As for those exceptions which are made against some particular passages in the body of the Liturgy, they are so frivolous that they are not worth the trouble of a serious confutation; he that pleases may see them sufficiently baffled by Mr <HI>Hooker,</HI> Mr <HI>Ball</HI> himself (a Nonconformist) in his tryal of the grounds of Seperation, with many others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your First excep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion is the issue of Spite and Ignorance; what though it contains many things that are in the Masse Book, as the Creeds, the Te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Commandments, the Lords-Prayer,
<PB N="144" REF="76">
and divers Collects? Shall a true man refuse to take his goods, and make the best he can of them because he finds them in a Theifs house? Or shall the husbandman refuse pure wheat because 'twas once mingl'd with chaff, and tares, albeit 'tis now winno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fted? Or shall we refuse <HI>Pauls</HI> Epistles, because there are in them certain savory passages taken out of the writings of Idolatrous Heathens?</P>
<P>The Church of <HI>Rome</HI> was once a glorious Church, true 'tis; its now sadly corrupted, yet as corrupt as 'tis, all is not chaff which that Church retains, there remain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in her some good wheat which was in her before her novel superstitions were in their Swadling cloaths, this wheat wee retain, the ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ff we h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve blown away with a Fan of an orderly Reformation, you see what a mali|cious cavil this is, that our Common-Prayer is taken out of the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ss; malice in some, and igno|rance, in others have been the true parents of this groundless calumny.</P>
<P N="2">2. As to your Second exception; that our Liturgie contains many short cuts and shreads of prayer: pray you what do you think of the Pub|licans Prayer, (God <HI>be mercifull to me a sinner</HI>) is any prayer in our Liturgie more short then that which our Saviour so well aproved? Short ejacu|culations, concise forms, Holy breathings of the Spirit are very frequent in the Scripture, and past all peradventure very acceptable to Almighty God; those that cavil at the shortness of our prayers and collects, let them justify the length
<PB N="145" REF="76">
of theirs if they can, from any one prayer in Scrip|ture, or Fathers that is a quater of an hower long.</P>
<P>Let any rational man who is acquainted with the nature of Prayer, and humane infirmities, seriously consider, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hether or no, our Church has not carried her self very prudently both in the Method, Phrase, Form and ordering of her Ser|vice.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know by my own experience th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t long extemporary Prayers are very apt to dull <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d|en our attentions, and I cannot deny but that sometimes I have been very much scandalized both at the matter, as also at the un-Scriptural, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">han|tastical, Affected expressions used in such Prayers, which is not to be seen in the Common-Prayer Book, whose phrase and words are very grav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and decent, and being taken out of the word of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">od

are most fit to be offer'd up to the Almighty God, when we speak unto him in Prayer. I am fully sa|tisfied with the excellent Method, Matter, grave Oratory of the English Liturgie, being 'tis so con|sonant to, and coresponding with, the Holy Scri|pture. So that I stand amaz'd at the impudence of those that first gave out, that 'twas borrowed from the <HI>Mass</HI> Book, and at the dull ignorance of those, that will believe so noto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ious a Lye. The Book I acknowledge to be rarely compos'd, and not onely useful in our publick Worship, but also a very profitable directory for our Family, &amp; private devotions.</P>
<P>Now to the last objection: Were it not better that some Apochryphal Chapters were left out of the calender, and Canonical Lessons set in their place?</P>

<P>Many learned men have indeed thought so, and have wished for a change in this particu|lar, Mr <HI>Hooker</HI> has these words, <HI>Those Eccle|siastical Books (for so they were cald in auntient times, not Apocryphal under which title were con|tain'd such Books which the Church allowed not at all to be read in publick) I say those Ecclesiastical Books which in case my self did think (as some do) that 'twere more safe and better that they were not to be read at all publikly: nevertheless as in other things of like nature, so in this I should be loath to oppose my private judgment against the force of their Reverend Authority, considering the excel|lency of some things in all, and of all things in certain of those Ecclesiastical Books which we publikly read,
<PB N="147" REF="77">
and therefore I have thought it better to let them stand as a list or a marginal border unto the Old Testament, and to grant at the least unto some of them publike audience in the house of God.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do fully acquiess in the pious, prudent, and peaceable determination of this worthy man: and so from the exceptions that are made against the liturgy I desire your discourse may proceed to those which are made against the Ceremonies of the Church; 'tis superfluous to name them all. But only those which are most spoken against, the Surplice, the Ring in Marriage, Bowing at the name of Jesus, Kneeling at the Sacrament, and especially the Cross in Baptisme, which are said to be Popish and superstitions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>As the <HI>Kingdom of Heaven does not consist in Meats, and Drinks, but in Righteousness and peace, Rom.</HI> 14. so neither does it consist in gestures, vestures, or any thing that is in it self indifferent; when the Church commands us to wear such a vestment, or to use such a gesture for Uniformity sake, and outward decency, not placing any in|trinsecal Holiness, or absolute necessity in any of those Ceremonies: 'tis our duty and not any su|perstition at all to be obedient; yea we are guilty of the sin of disobedience, and superstition also if we stand out against lawfull Authority.</P>
<P>For there is a two fold Superstition, one Positive, as when we ascribe Holiness to any thing that is in its own nature indifferent, morrally neither good nor evil; another Negative, as when we <HI>Dogmatize,</HI> and call that evil which Morally is not so, and in
<PB N="148" REF="78">
such things, <HI>Weare not, Kneel not,</HI> is as much Su|perstition as <HI>Weare or Kneel</HI> possibly can be.</P>
<P>What is it to any understanding man, whether he Prayes or Preaches in Black or White or any o|ther Colour, unless it be for decency and unifor|mity? the power of the Church limits us to a White <HI>Surplice,</HI> rather then to a Black <HI>Iump,</HI> or short <HI>Cloak.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is not this an intrenchment upon our Christian liberty, to be confind to particular Modes and Forms?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all. So long as our practice only is limited, and our judgment left free as before any such <HI>Canon</HI> was made; 'tis strang that the same men who enjoyned three Ceremonies at the taking of the <HI>Covenant</HI> as to be bare Headed, bare Hand|ed, the right Hand lifted up, should so much scruple them in our Publick Service.</P>
<P>But in a word, 'tis plain Scripture, that <HI>every Soul should be subject to the Higher Powers, not onely for wrath but also for Conscience sake.</HI> Now unless the Non-Conformists can bring as plain Scripture against our Ceremonies, to prove them morally evil, they must incurr the sin of Schisme, and disobedience to those powers which God has ordained; and these are far greater sins then the wearing of a Surplice, though we had borrow'd it from the <HI>Pope</HI> himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mind me now of one of the great|est exceptions against the Surplice, &amp;c. because the <HI>Papists</HI> use it in their superstitious Wor|ship,
<PB N="149" REF="78">
therefore 'tis unlawful for us to wear it in ours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>If this were a good reason, 'twould follow; whatsoever the <HI>Papists</HI> do use or have a|bused in their Superstition, 'tis unlawful for us, (who have abandoned such trash and I rumpery to) use, but <HI>Papists</HI> have abused our Churches, (ha|lices, and other Ornaments in their fals Worship and Services, therefore we may not use them; <HI>but down with them, down with them even to the Ground.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>This indeed will be a very necessary consequent, but a very costly one, I fear the men that make this exception, would not be very for|ward to Build them up again: if Idolatry and Su|perstition, were a just cause to make us lay aside our Surplices; by the same reason we must pull down our Churches, and upon the same accompt the Primitive Christians ought not to have eaten meat offered to Idols, neither to have made use of the Heathens Tempels, to celebrate the Worship and Service of the true God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>You see then how frivilous the excepti|on against the Surplice is, and so are all those that are offer'd against the Ring in Marriage, bowing at the name of Jesus. Kneeling at the Sacrament, the Crosse after Baptisme, and therefore I shall very briefly pass them over.</P>
<P N="1">1. For the Ring 'tis as Antient, at least, as <HI>Turtullian</HI> who lived about two hundred Years af|ter Christ, he makes mention of it more then once, and our Church do's use it as an ancient Ceremony, no ways essential to Matrimony.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="150" REF="79">2. Bowing at the name of Jesus is likewise ve|ry Antient: The reason of it was, 1. To shew our readiness to yield obedience and subjection to him as our Lord and King; <HI>to whom all power both in Heaven and Earth is given, and to whom every Knee must bow.</HI> Phil. 2.10. The Antient Christians rather bowed at the naming of Jesus, then at the name of Christ, in opposition to the unbelieving Jews, who most of all Blasphemed that sweet and saving name of Jesus: which therefore they did indeavour the more highly to exalt. 3. To de|clare their certain belief of what the Apostle fore|te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, that <HI>at the name of Iesus every Knee should bow, of things in Heaven, things in Earth, and things un|der the Earth, that all things should be subject unto him.</HI> Phil. 2.</P>
<P N="3">3. Kneeling at the Sacrament, our Church con|ceives to be the most humble and reverend posture, and therefore most suitable to so high and Heaven|ly a Mistery, especially it being Administred with a Prayer; yet we do not condemn the practise of other Churches, where this holy Sacrament is re|ceived sitting or standing; neither should they condemn us for Kneeling because Christ's Disciples receiv'd it in a Table gesture, to which we are no more bound then to the place, or time, in which they reciv'd it. An upper Room and after Supper as the learned Dr. <HI>Sanderson</HI> has evidently demon|strated.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Cross after Baptisme is also a very Antient Ceremony, which the Christians of the first ages, used in a couragious and undaunted oppo|sition
<PB N="151" REF="79">
against the Heathens, and Jews, who scoffed and derided them for beleiving in, and Worshiping a Crucified God for their Saviour, who could not save himself. True 'tis in process of time, the Cross was abused, to grose Superstition, and therefore say some, it ought to be laid aside, as <HI>Ezekias</HI> abollished the Brasen Serpent when the people made it an Idol.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Much more ought the Cross to be taken away being abused to superstition, because 'twas but an humane invention, where as the Brasen Ser|pent, was set up by Gods own direction and command.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, but then let <HI>Ezekias</HI> do it, not the people on their own heads, without the Authority of the King. However the use of an innocent Ceremony ought not to be taken away because of 'its abuse; and here it ought to be con|sider'd, whether it be better to use the Cross to put us in mind of our duty, not to be ashamed of Christ Crusifi'd, as also of the courage and bold|ness of the Primitive Christians, who not with|standing the Scoffs and Reproches of Infidels, would make such open profession of their Faith in Christ Crucified, as to use the sign of the Cross, not only in Baptism, but also upon sundry other occasions; or else, whether 'twere better to for|bear the use of it, because it has been so much a|bused to Superstition: let the Suprem power judge which of these is fittest to be done, and determine accordingly either for the Negative or the Affir|mative; and I believe every sober and peacable Christian will esteem it his duty to submit unto
<PB N="152" REF="80">
such a determination.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>But seing these and other ceremonies have been and are a great scandal to tender consci|ences, and the occasions of many sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rp contentions amongst Christians, agreeing in the substantials of Religion, and seing that Conformists themselves confess them not to be in their own nature necessa|ry, but only expedient for order and decency, were it not better they were laid aside, then conti|nued is they are, the perpetual causes of discord and dissention amongst us?</P>

<SPEAKER>Dub.</SPEAKER>
<P>But really Sir, were it not more beseem|ing Christian prudence so far to condescend to our dissenting Brethren (who agree with us in the Doctrine of our Church) in taking away, at least some, of those Ceremonies which are more liable to exception, then to comply with the Superstiti|ous <HI>Papists</HI> in the use of them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Firm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess, some moderate men have thought so, especially since we are frustrated of of one main end, for which our first reformers re|tained them, which was to draw over the Papists into the Communion of our Church, which they did adhere unto, for the Ten first years of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> until they were interdicted by the Popes bull, But seeing we are deprived of all hopes of that much desired issue and that by the cunning of Priests and Jesuits, stirring up and animating the Conformists and Non-conformists against each other, about these Ceremonies. Our differences amongst our selves do daily increase and multiply; some wise and peaceable men have desired that the use of certain of those Ceremo|nies might be forborn at least for a time, which not withstanding, they are still continued. These peaceable men abhor the great sin of Separation &amp; do continue their conformity to the rites of our Church; daily begging at the throne of Grace that the God of truth and peace would for his mercy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ake so assist <HI>those powers which he has ordained</HI> that

they may be instrumental for the establishing of truth and peace amongst us.</P>

<P>I like well of the temper of these men, and wish that their <HI>moderation were</HI> not only <HI>known unto,</HI> but practised by, <HI>all men</HI>; for certainly if the Spirit of love, peace, and meekness, did rule more in our peevish and froward hearts, we should enjoy a greater measure of Peace, Love, and Christian Charity, then these angry times have hither to been happy with.</P>

<P>This I confess to be true, from my own experience. Nothing wrought so much upon me to fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sake the Church of England, as the wicked and ungodly lives of those which she receives into her Communion.</P>

<P>This censure is very severe, and yet I cannot tell what to reply against it.
