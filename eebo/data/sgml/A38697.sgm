<L>Faith, I think we must e'ne follow the old</L>
<L>Trade; eat well, and prepare our selves with</L>
<L>A Bottle or two of good <HI>Burgundy,</HI> that our</L>
<L>Old acquaintance may look lovely in our Eyes;</L>

<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<L>Well! this is grown a wicked Town, it was</L>
<L>Otherwise in my memory; a Gentleman</L>
<L>Should not have gone out of his Chamber,</L>

<L>Notice where he might have had a course or</L>

<L>Truly a good motherly woman of my acquaintance</L>
<L>T'other day, talking of the sins of the times,</L>
<L>Told me, with tears in her Eyes, that there are a</L>
<L>Company of higling Rascals, who partly</L>
<L>For themselves, but more especially for some</L>
<L>Secret friends, daily forestall the Markets;</L>
<L>Nay, and that many Gentlemen who formerly had</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="4">
Been Persons of great worth and honour, are of late,</L>
<L>For some private reasons, become their own</L>
<L>Purveyors, to the utter decay and disencouragement</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<L>I know there are some wary Merchants,</L>
<L>Who never trust their business to a Factor;</L>

<L>Only my joy to see you, Sir <HI>Oliver,</HI> and to</L>

<SPEAKER>Sir Oliv.</SPEAKER>
<L>Methinks, indeed, I have been an age absent,</L>
<L>But I intend to redeem the time; and how, and how</L>
<L>Stand Affairs, prithee now? is the Wine good?</L>
<L>Are the Women kind?</L>
<L>Well, faith, a man had better be a vagabond</L>
<L>In this Town, than a Justice of Peace in the</L>
<L>Country: I was e'ne grown a Sot for want</L>
<L>Of Gentleman-like recreations; if a man</L>
<L>Do but rap out an Oath, the people start</L>
<L>As if a Gun went off; and if one chance</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="5">
But to couple himself with his Neighbours</L>
<L>Daughter, without the help of the Parson of</L>
<L>The Parish, and leave a little testimony of</L>
<L>His kindness behind him, there is presently</L>
<L>Such an uproar, that a poor man is fain to</L>
<L>Fly his Country: as for drunkenness, 'tis true,</L>
<L>It may be us'd without so and all, but the Drink</L>
<L>Is so abominable, that a man would for bear it,</L>
<L>For fear of being made out of love with the vice.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cour.</SPEAKER>
<L>I see, Sir <HI>Oliver,</HI> you continue still your old</L>
<L>Humour, and are resolv'd to break your sweet</L>
<L>Lady's heart.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Oliv.</SPEAKER>
<L>You do not think me sure so barbarously</L>
<L>Unkind, to let her know all this; no, no, these</L>
<L>Are secrets fit only to be trusted to such</L>
<L>Honest Fellows as thou art.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cour.</SPEAKER>
<L>Well may I, poor Sinner, be excus'd, since</L>
<L>A Woman of such rare beauty, such incomparable</L>
<L>Parts, and of such an unblemished</L>
<L>Reputation, is not able to reclaim you from</L>
<L>These wild courses, Sir <HI>Oliver.</HI></L>

<SPEAKER>Sir Oliv.</SPEAKER>
<L>To say the truth, she is a Wife that no man</L>
<L>Need be asham'd of, <HI>Ned.</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cour.</SPEAKER>
<L>I vow, Sir <HI>Oliver,</HI> I must needs blame you,</L>
<L>Considering how tenderly she loves you.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Oliv.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ay, Ay, the more is her misfortune and mine</L>
<L>Too <HI>Ned:</HI> I would willingly give thee a pai&punc;</L>
<L>Of the best Coach-Horses in my Stable, so</L>
<L>Thou could'st but perswade her to love me</L>
<L>Less.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cour.</SPEAKER>
<L>Her virtue and my friendship sufficiently</L>
<L>Secure you against that, Sir <HI>Oliver.</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Oliv.</SPEAKER>
<L>I know thou wert never married; but has it</L>
<L>Never been thy misfortune to have a Mistress</L>
<L>Love thee thus entirely?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cour.</SPEAKER>
<L>It never has been my good fortune, Sir <HI>Oliver&punc;</HI></L>
<L>But why do you ask this question?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Oliv.</SPEAKER>
<L>Because then, perchance, thou might'st have</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="5">
Been a little sensible what a damn'd trouble it is.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cour.</SPEAKER>
<L>As how, Sir <HI>Oliver?</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Oliv.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why look thee, thus: for a man cannot be</L>
<L>Altogether ungrateful, sometimes one is oblig'd</L>
<L>To kiss, and fawn, and toy, and lye fooling an hour</L>
<L>Or two, when a man had rather, if it were not for</L>
<L>The disgrace sake, stand all that while in the Pillory</L>
<L>Paulted with rotten Eggs and Oranges.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cour.</SPEAKER>
<L>This is a very hard case indeed, Sir <HI>Oliver.</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Oliv.</SPEAKER>
<L>And then the inconvenience of keeping</L>
<L>Regular hours; but above all, that damn'd fiend</L>
<L>Jealousie does so possess these passionate Lovers,</L>
<L>That I protest, <HI>Ned,</HI> under the <HI>Rose</HI> be it spoken,</L>
<L>If I chance to be a little prodigal in my expence</L>
<L>On a private Friend or so, I am call'd to so strict</L>
<L>An account at night, that for quietness sake I am</L>
<L>Often forc'd to take a Dose of Cantharides to</L>
<L>Make up the sum.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cour.</SPEAKER>
<L>Indeed, Sir <HI>Oliver,</HI> every thing consider'd,</L>
<L>You are not so much to be envy'd as one may</L>
<L>Rashly imagine.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Oliv.</SPEAKER>
<L>Well, a pox of this tying man and woman</L>
<L>Together, for better, for worse! upon my conscience</L>
<L>It was but a Trick that the Clergy might have</L>
<L>A feeling in the Cause.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cour.</SPEAKER>
<L>I do not conceive it to be much for their</L>
<L>Profit, Sir <HI>Oliver,</HI> for I dare lay a good wager,</L>
<L>Let 'em but allow Christian Liberty, and they</L>
<L>Shall get ten times more by Christnings,</L>
<L>Than they are likely to lose by Marriages.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Oliv.</SPEAKER>
<L>Faith, thou hast hit it right, <HI>Ned;</HI> and now</L>
<L>Thou talk'st of Christian Liberty, prethee let us</L>
<L>Dine together to day, and be swingingly merry,</L>
<L>But with all secrecy.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cour.</SPEAKER>
<L>I shall be glad of your good company, Sir <HI>Oliver.</HI></L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Oliv.</SPEAKER>
<L>I am to call on a very honest Fellow, whom</L>
<L>I left here hard by making a Visit, Sir <HI>Iossin, Iolly,</HI></L>
<L>A Kinsman of my Wifes, and my Neighbour in the</L>

Country; we call Brothers, he came up to Town</L>
<L>With me, and lodgeth in the same house; he has</L>
<L>Brought up a couple of the prettiest Kinswomen,</L>

<L>Hadst the instructing of 'em a little;</L>
<L>Faith, if I am not very much mistaken,</L>

<L>Opinion of, and will trust me with him</L>
<L>Any where; but to say truth, he is as arrant</L>
<L>A sinner as the best of us, and will boggle at</L>
<L>Nothing that becomes a man of Honour.</L>
<L>We will go and get leave of my Lady;</L>

<L>The truth is, I ought not to be very</L>

<SP>

<L>I cannot but think of those Letters, Sister.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gat.</SPEAKER>
<L>That is, you cannot but think of Mr. <HI>Freeman,</HI></L>
<L>Sister; I perceive he runs in thy head as much as</L>
<L>A new Gown uses to do in the Country, the</L>
<L>Night before 'tis expected from <HI>London.</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aria.</SPEAKER>
<L>You need not talk, for I am sure the losses</L>
<L>Of an unlucky Gamester are not more his</L>
<L>Meditation, then Mr. <HI>Courtall</HI> is yours.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gat.</SPEAKER>
<L>He has made some slight impression on my</L>
<L>Memory, I confess; but I hope a night will</L>
<L>Wear him out agen, as it does the noise</L>
<L>Of a Fiddle after Dancing.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aria.</SPEAKER>
<L>Love, like some stains, will wear out of it</L>
<L>Self, I know, but not in such a little time as</L>
<L>You talk of, Sister.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="81" REF="43">
<SPEAKER>Gat.</SPEAKER>
<L>It cannot last longer then the stain of a</L>
<L>Mulberry at most; the next season out that goes,</L>
<L>And my heart cannot be long unfruitful, sure.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aria.</SPEAKER>
<L>Well, I cannot believe they forg'd these</L>
<L>Letters; what shou'd be their end?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gat.</SPEAKER>
<L>That you may easily guess at; but methinks</L>
<L>They took a very improper way to compass it.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aria.</SPEAKER>
<L>It looks more like the malice or Jealousie</L>
<L>Of a Woman, then the design of two witty men.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gat.</SPEAKER>
<L>If this shou'd prove a Fetch of her Ladiships</L>
<L>Now, that is a playing the loving Hypocrite</L>
<L>Above with her dear Sir <HI>Oliver.</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aria.</SPEAKER>
<L>How unluckily we were interrupted, when</L>
<L>They were going to show us the hand!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gat.</SPEAKER>
<L>That might have discover'd all: I have a</L>
<L>Small suspicion, that there has been a little</L>
<L>Familiarity between her Ladiship and</L>
<L>Mr. <HI>Courtall.</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aria.</SPEAKER>
<L>Our finding of 'em together in the Exchange,</L>
<L>And several passages I observ'd at the Bear, have</L>
<L>Almost made me of the same opinion.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gat.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yet I wou'd fain believe the countinuance</L>
<L>Of it is more her desire, then his inclination:</L>
<L>That which makes me mistrust him most, is her</L>
<L>Knowing we made 'em an appointment.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aria.</SPEAKER>
<L>If she were jealous of Mr. <HI>Courtall,</HI> she</L>
<L>Wou'd not be jealous of Mr. <HI>Freeman</HI> too; they</L>
<L>Both pretend to have receiv'd Letters.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gat.</SPEAKER>
<L>There is something in it more then we are</L>
<L>Able to imagine; time will make it out, I hope,</L>
<L>To the advantage of the Gentlemen.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aria.</SPEAKER>
<L>I wou'd gladly have it so; for I believe,</L>
<L>Shou'd they give us a just cause, we should find it</L>
<L>A hard task to hate them.</L>
