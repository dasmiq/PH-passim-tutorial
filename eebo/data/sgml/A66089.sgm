<HEAD>The Scene.</HEAD>
<P>THe frontispiece is a wreath of fresh Foliage, much like the enterance in|to a close Alley, the tops whereof in|terlac'd, represent the perfect figure of an Arch; at whose intersection is a kind of knot, whereon is enscribed in letters of gold, <HI>FOREST</HI>: over which two little <HI>Cupidons</HI> by either hand support a Garland little di|stant from the same. At either foot hereof is plac'd on little pedistals the figure of a Shep|herd and Shepherdess; the one in a pretty posture, merrily playing on a Flute, the other very intentively ordring her scatter'd flowrs in form of a Garland. To which succeeds, in prospective order, close united Trees, which by degrees o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">retop each other, the former not much exceeding the height of a man, through which the sight is conveyed to a ve|ry fair Palace; at foot whereof runneth a winding stream; the Canopy of the whole a Serene Skie.</P>
<P><PB REF="5">THe Scene being a pretty while discovered, appears at far end thereof a Shepherdess, with a little Dog parried in Ribbons of seve|ral colours; when sodainly, privately within, are heard sundry voices, one answering the o|ther, till each have sung his part: at the end whereof all joyn their voices; each voice is so ordered as may seem far distant from the Auditors, and a like distant from each other.</P>
