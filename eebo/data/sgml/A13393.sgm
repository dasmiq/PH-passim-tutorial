<L>Then did I think upon my former charge,</L>

<L>And all those pleasures I that night did see,</L>

<L>Like a true Subject, in another land</L>
<L>In trust for her, must let her praises be</L>
<L>Blazon'd by Fames guilt Trump of Poesie.</L>
<L>And first unto my Dearest as a friend,</L>
<L>I did unfold my Dreame, and recommend</L>
<L>Each passage I had seene, time, place, and where</L>
<L>Of paine, joy, griefe, or blisse, she might have share.</L>
<L>But shee not giving credit or beliefe</L>
<L>To any such weake fictions, nor reliefe</L>
<L>To me, or any others; but doth still</L>
<L>Continue in her bad obdurate will.</L>
<L>Leave her I must; but let her know, that face</L>
