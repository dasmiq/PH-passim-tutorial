<P>Let it please your Maiestie to looke vpon these my Workes with a fauourable eye and to take them into your Royall Pro|tection: They were brought foorth in the Land of Your Birth, euen in your olde <HI>SCOTLAND,</HI> Whereof your Maiestie is now the hundreth and ninth King.</P>
<P>The particular place where this Booke was penned is your owne <HI>GLAS|GOWE,</HI> a Citie once greatlie beloued of great King IAMES your Maiesties Father of blessed memorie: * A Citie that looketh for the like fauour from your Royall MAIESTIE.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">My chiefest spirituall desire is, that this may bee comfortable to sicke Soules: My first temporall wish is that your Maiestie would daine it with a blink of your Fauour: Let it obtaine your Royall Approbation, which shall bee to it as a Passe-port, which neither Pride nor Enuie shall bee able with Reason to reiect: If anie man be con|tentious, I heere appell vnto <HI>Caesar.</HI></P>
<P>Let mee bee so bolde as heere to aske a Petition from your Maiestie, which gran|ted, I will atcount a sufficient recompence to all my Labours.</P>
<P>This is it, That it would please your Religious Maiestie to take a specall care that the prophanation of the Lords blessed and hallowed day bee remoued from this Land: It is come to such a custome and that chieflie betweene <HI>Edinburgh</HI> and <HI>Glasgow,</HI> that by no meanes the Church is able to refine it, except that by your Royall authoritie their Market dayes bee changed: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Note&punc;</NOTE> The abuse is so great that if your godlie Maiestie knew it, yee could not in|dure it: The keeping of this Precept is the onelie one which hath a <HI>memento</HI> before it, and yet it is most forgotten: <HI>It is the verie Key of Religion.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="5">Let it please your Maiestie to consi|der what good <HI>Nehemiah</HI> did for the re|formation of such an abuse.</P>
<P><HI>I contended,</HI> said hee, <HI>with the No|bles<NOTE PLACE="marg">Neh. 13. 17</NOTE> of</HI> Iudah, <HI>and saide vnto them, What euill thing is this that yee doe, and prophane the Sabbath day?

<P>See what Nehemiah did.</P>
<P><HI>It came to passe that when the<NOTE PLACE="marg">vers, 19.</NOTE> gates of</HI> Ierusalem <HI>beganne to be dark before the Sabbath, I commanded that the gates should bee shut, and charged that they should not bee ope|ned till after the Sabbath, And some of my Seruants set I at the gates, that there should no burden bee brought in<NOTE PLACE="marg">vers. 20.</NOTE> on the Sabbath day: So the Merchands and sellers of all kinde of ware, lodged without</HI> Ierusalem <HI>once or twise: Then<NOTE PLACE="marg">vers. 21.</NOTE> I testified against them, and said vnto them, Why lodge yee about the wall: If yee doe so againe I will lay hands on you.</HI></P>
<P>What wrought that?</P>

<P>One thing I desire earnestlie that your Maiestie once at least in the day would carefullie consider these weightie wordes of DAVID spoken vnto SOLOMON: Thinke that King IAMES hath said them to King CHARLES: These<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>1 Chr. 28. 9</HI> Sicut po|tentes po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> tenter t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">r&punc; menta pa|tientur, sic &amp; ju|sti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">|mijs fruen|tur plenius si recte ex|ercue&punc; rint potestate~.</NOTE> bee the words,</P>

<SPEAKER>The Pastour.</SPEAKER>
<P>The best methode I know, is that a man ripe first vp his Conscience, and spy what <HI>mot of sinne</HI> is fallen into his Conscience, which is the <HI>eye of the Soule:</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Note</NOTE> The eye beeing hurt will water &amp; powre out teares, so must the Conscience bee sore grieued for offending of God: Se|condlie, out of this griefe it must sigh before the Lord in feruant pra|yer, first, for forgiuenesse chieflie of that sinne, which lyeth heauiest vp|on the heart: Thirdlie and last of all, the Soule must sute earnestly for the restoring of that joye.</P>
<P>After this manner <HI>Dauid</HI> did pro|ceede in that penetentiall Psalme: First of all, he was exceedinglie grie|ued, which griefe did burst out in

<PB N="369" REF="198">
<HI>Israel</HI> had <HI>the typ</HI> in the brasen Ser|pent, which healed al the be holders: My counsell also is, that such trou|bled persons frequent the Sermons of powerfull Preachers, and seeke conference with them, whom God hath stamped with a powerfull gift of Teaching and integritie of life, men who haue had great experience in the wayes of God, and who haue <HI>smarted</HI> themselues at other times by such fearefull <HI>nipping checks,</HI> men who are not ignorant of the Deuils deuices.</P>

<PB N="370" REF="199">
that hee might bee able to suc|cour vs in our temptations.</P>
<P>While the troubled sinner is in doing all these dueties, he must care|fullie watch ouer all his wayes, that by no sin either in thought, word, or deede hee grieue the Spirit of God againe: For a new sinne thrust vpon the hearte, will make all the closed woundes of the Conscience to gap and to bleed afresh: A Soule that is become relaps shall finde God har|der, to bee intreated, than of before, not without much adoe shall it get peace, that after by any knowne sin it hath quarrelled againe the Spirit of comfort.</P>
<P>But indeede, hee or shee whose Conscience hath beene once well <HI>lashed with Gods whip,</HI> and <HI>battered with his blowes,</HI> had rather run throw a fire, than anger the Lord againe: At the first appearance of a tempta|tion they will start for feare, and with a sigh will cry to God with a

<P>The last difficultie wherein my Soule did sticke as yee may remem|ber, was concerning my Faith, which I concluded not to bee, be|cause I had no peace of Conscience, This did marre and deface all my comforts: My ground was from the Apostle, whose wordes are, <HI>That beeing justified by Faith, we haue peace</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 5. 1</NOTE> <HI>toward God:</HI> I haue heard you de|clare that a man may haue Faith &amp; yet for some space not to bee sensi|ble of that peace.</P>
<P>O my God, let thy mercie be close|lie applyed to my Soule, strengthen my Faith, that I may grippe and ap|prehend it with a sure and euerla|sting hold: Oh that my soule might lye downe in that peace that passeth
<PB N="382" REF="205">
all vnderstanding: I am sore trou|bled with a weake and wauering heart, which is yet tossed, and swayed to and fro with doubts and difficulties lik a feather in the wind.</P>
<P>Alas, Sir, I complaine of the weakenesse of my Faith: That Faith must be stro~g, which is able to draw downe Saluation from the heauens, and batter downe strong holds and ouerthrow principalities and po|wers, and conqueare, and subdue, tame, represse, and repell our stron|gest corruptions.</P>
<P>Let mee see I pray you any parti|ticulare example of a <HI>weake Faith,</HI> wherby any at any time haue beene saued&punc; by the Light of Gods word dispell this <HI>mist of ignorance:</HI> Make mee free of this <HI>shrewd temptation.</HI></P>

<P>In the judgment of some so soone as the dead shall bee raised and the liuing changed, before that we shall meete with Christ into the cloudes, there shall be a sore mourning both among the Godlie and the wicked, for the piercing of that Lord: Euery one of the Godlie in that day shall<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 41. 9</NOTE> say as the <HI>Butler</HI> said to <HI>Pharaoh I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"></HI>

<P>I finde two probable reasons, first because the great God of mercie is more bent to shew mercie toward his creatures, than to powre venge|ance vpon them, and that for to teach all Iudges to execute Iustice with Grauitie and griefe.</P>
<P>Beholde heere howe our God, while hee is euen <HI>come vnto the last periode,</HI> giueth vnto the wicked who

<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Note</NOTE> The other reason wherefore he speaketh first to the Godlie such words of comfort and of comming, is that the wicked who in the dayes of their vanitie combined sport with spight against him, may see how good a God hee shall bee to all these which haue serued him heere in Faith and trueth. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Note</NOTE> O what shall the <HI>trembling Soules of these vvorldlre brates</HI> that would not serue Christ in their life thinke when they shall heare that Lord <HI>so sweetlie in so sweete heauenly &amp; honey vvords,</HI> say vnto al his Saints <HI>his dearest Dar|lings,</HI>

<P>He who would rightly draw a mans <HI>portrature</HI> must paint his <HI>blamishes</HI> as well as his <HI>beautie:</HI> In such a case his <HI>wrats</HI> &amp; his <HI>wrinkles</HI> must be wroght with the <HI>pinsell,</HI> that his image may bee like vnto himselfe: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Note</NOTE> If men be onelie <HI>portreyed in their vertues,</HI> the halfe of their face shall not be seene: What is the most part of mans life heere but a sinning against God, and a prouocation of the eyes of his glo|rie? <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Note</NOTE> The best men that liue here in the greatest perfection of Gods image are like a <HI>quarter Moone,</HI> in|lightened but in a <HI>fourt part:</HI> How many haue but a <HI>sharpe edge</HI> like the <HI>Moone</HI> first seene after the change?</P>

<P>After this manner Sir, <HI>the man of</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Quis hic fuit non liquet.</NOTE> <HI>God</HI> spake vpon his death-bedde.</P>
<P>I owe to God a death, as his Son died for mee: Euer since I was borne I haue beene sayling to this Hauen, and gathering patience to comfort this houre; therefore shall I bee one of these Guestes nowe, that would not come to the banket when they were inuited? <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Note</NOTE> What hurt is in go|ing to <HI>Paradise?</HI> I shall lose nothing but the sense of euill: And anone I

<P>The Prophets and the Apostles are my fore-runners: Euery man is gone before mee, or else hee will follow after mee: If it please God to receiue mee into Heauen before them which haue serued him better, I owe more thankfulnesse vnto him.</P>
<P>And because I haue deferred my repentance till this houre whereby my Saluation is cutte off, if I should die suddenlie: Loe how my God in his mercifull prouidence, to pre|uent my destruction, calleth mee by a lingring sicknesse, which stayeth till I bee readie, and prepareth mee to mine ende like a preacher, and maketh mee by wholesome paines, wearie of this beloued world, lest I should depart vn willing like them whose death is their damnation.</P>

<L>OVR poore life heere is not of single Ioyes,</L>
<L>But mixt with Gall, and worme-woode of annoyes:</L>
<L>The dint of Winds, and waues, and stors mie streames,</L>
<L>Wee must endure before wee reach to Heauens:</L>
<L>Paines heere wants pause, all is but losse and labour:</L>
<L>A thousand cares Within our hearts doe harbour.</L>
<L>The life of man on Earth is but a blaste,</L>
<L>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> comes with Teares and endeth with a gaspe:</L>
<L>All that is heere is with a speedie flight,</L>
<L>On jangling wheeles soone hurled out of sight.</L>
<L>All that is heere is out of Tune and tast,</L>
<L>All whirles about, but Rest will come at last.</L>
<L>VVaite still vntill that Day spring from on High,</L>
<L>Come downe with thousands brighter than the Skie.</L>
<L>Then mistie Cloudes of sorrowes shall depart,</L>
<L>When that <HI>Aurora</HI> shall rejoyce our Heart.</L>

<L>HEere bubbling Waters Seas of sorrowes dash,</L>
<L>Heere Waues, heere Winds which make the Cloudes to clash:</L>
<L>Heere Feuers, Fyres, heere fickle vanities,</L>
<L>Combined are to bring Calamities</L>
<L>To mortall man (not sparing young or olde)</L>
<L>Whose life is like vnto a tale thats tolde,</L>
<L>Now happie hee who free from all distresse,</L>
<L>Rests in the Heauens, far from this wildernes.</L>
