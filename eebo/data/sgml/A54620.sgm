<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Celebrated Au|thor of the follow|ing Treatise, had not only the Honour to be known to Your Grace's Grand-Father, the late Illustrious Duke of <HI>ORMOND,</HI> but was likewise held by Him in that just Esteem, which he never fail'd of expressing towards Men of
<PB REF="3">
Learning and Ingenuity. This was a sufficient Encouragement to me (having the Manuscript-Copy deliver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d into my Hands by a Worthy and Intimate Friend of the Authors, to di|spose of it to the Press for the publick Benefit) to Address it to Your Grace's Patronage. You are so true a Successor in all the generous Virtues of Your Ancestry, that I can|not doubt of Your favour|able Reception of this Post|humous Work. Your Gene|rosity, that takes all occasi|ons of exerting it self towards the Living, cannot fail in do|ing
<PB REF="3">
Justice to the Memory of the Dead. More especial|ly to such Persons as in their Life took care to oblige Poste|rity.</P>
<P>The usefulness of the en|suing Discourse at this time, when there is so fair a pro|spect of a new Settlement in <HI>IRELAND,</HI> were suf|ficient to recommend it to Your Grace's Protection. Your Grace's Interest in the Re-establishment of that King|dom (tho it be considerable) yet is much less than your Share in the glorious Enter|prize towards its Recovery.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">You had the Honour of ac|companying His MAJESTY in an Adventure that shall shine in the Annals of <HI>Fame,</HI> as long as the <HI>Boyne</HI> shall main|tain its Course. But a sin|gle Gallantry appear'd not sufficient for the Heir of OR|MOND and OSSERY. You have since accompanied our Royal Master to other Shores, to be partaker with him in new Scenes of Action, Under|takings of no less Consequence and Importance, than the De|liverance of <HI>Europe.</HI> This will afford sufficient matter for Pa|negyrick, and oblige the Mu|ses
<PB REF="4">
to place you in the same high Rank of Renown with Your Noble and Heroick Pre|decessors. In the mean time, be pleas'd to permit this useful Treatise to wait on you to the Camp, and bring you the hearty wishes of all good Men here, for Your happy Expe|dition, and Your safe Return, which is desir'd by none with a more particular Zeal, than by</P>

<HEAD>THE Author's Preface.</HEAD>
<P>SIR <HI>Francis Bacon,</HI> in his <HI>Advance|ment of Learning,</HI> hath made a judi|cious <HI>Parallel</HI> in many particulars, be|tween the <HI>Body Natural,</HI> and <HI>Body Politick,</HI> and between the Arts of preserving both in Health and Strength: And it is as reasonable, that as <HI>Anatomy</HI> is the best foundation of one, so also of the other; and that to practice upon the Politick, without knowing the <HI>Sym|metry, Fabrick,</HI> and <HI>Proportion</HI> of it, is as <HI>casual</HI> as the practice of Old-women and Em|pyricks.</P>
<P>Now, because <HI>Anatomy</HI> is not only neces|sary in Physicians, but laudable in every Phi|losophical person whatsoever; I therefore, who profess no Politicks, have, for my curiosity, at large attempted <HI>the first Essay of Political Anatomy.</HI></P>
<P>Furthermore, as Students in Medicine, practice their inquiries upon cheap and common <HI>Animals,</HI> and such whose actions they are best
<PB REF="6">
acquainted with, and where there is the least confusion and perplexure of Parts; I have cho|sen <HI>Ireland</HI> as such a <HI>Political Animal,</HI> who is scarce Twenty years old; where the <HI>Intrigue</HI> of <HI>State</HI> is not very complicate, and with which I have been conversant from an <HI>Embri|on</HI>; and in which, if I have done amiss, the fault may be easily mended by another.</P>
<P>'Tis true, that curious <HI>Dissections</HI> cannot be made without variety of proper Instruments; whereas I have had only a commo~n <HI>Knife</HI> and a <HI>Clout,</HI> instead of the many more helps which such a Work requires: However, my rude approaches. being enough to find where|about the Liver and Spleen, and Lungs lye, tho' not to discern the Lymphatick Vessels, the <HI>Plexus, Choroidus,</HI> the <HI>Volvuli</HI> of vessels within the Testicles; yet not knowing, that even what I have here readily done, was much considered, or indeed thought useful by others, I have ventur'd to <HI>begin</HI> a <HI>new</HI> Work, which, when Corrected and Enlarged by better Hands and Helps. I believe will tend to the Peace and Plenty of my Country; besides which, I have no other end.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Reader</HI> is desired to take notice, That by <HI>Letter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es,</HI> are meant persons restored to Land by virtue of the <HI>Letters</HI> of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second; and by <HI>Nominees,</HI> such persons are intended, as were restored to their Lands by being <HI>named</HI> in the <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Settlement</HI>; and Papists <HI>per Proviso,</HI> were such as had <HI>Provisoes</HI> in that <HI>Act</HI> for their Lands: And by <HI>the</HI> 49 <HI>Officers,</HI> are meant such <HI>Commission Officers</HI> under the King, who served in <HI>Ireland</HI> before the <HI>year</HI> of our <HI>Lord,</HI> 1649.</P>
<P>The following Treatise of Sir <HI>William Petty's Political Anatomy of Ireland,</HI> is Print|ed after a Copy Transcribed from the <HI>Origi|nal,</HI> writ by the <HI>Author</HI>'s own hand; and all the <HI>Blanks,</HI> as here Printed, were in that <HI>Original:</HI> And which, tho' it may be sup|pos'd he could easily have fill'd up, yet was it not held proper for any other to attempt, or to add to any thing done by so great a <HI>Master.</HI></P>
<P>This his work of <HI>The Political Ana|tomy of Ireland</HI> ends in <HI>page</HI> 113.</P>
<P><PB REF="7"><HI>P.</HI> 114. begins the famous <HI>Report</HI> from the <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Trade</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> which was not only <HI>Drawn,</HI> but wholly <HI>Composed</HI> by Sir <HI>William Petty</HI>; and with which that Council concurred unanimously.</P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> 132. followeth the Copy of the <HI>Com|mission</HI> of the late <HI>Duke of Ormond</HI> to be <HI>Lord Lieutenant</HI>; and an Account of the <HI>Establishment of the Civil and Military List</HI> in his time; faithfully and carefully taken out of Authentick <HI>Records:</HI> And to the Na|ture of which, the continued <HI>Title</HI> of <HI>The Political Anatomy of</HI> Ireland, on those <HI>Pa|ges,</HI> agrees well enough.</P>
<P>The <HI>Volume</HI> concludes with Sir <HI>William Petty</HI>'s <HI>Verbum Sapienti,</HI> which relates wholly to <HI>England,</HI> and shews how Taxes may be equally laid, and how the Nation may well bear the Tax of Four Millions <HI>per Annum.</HI></P>
<P>The Reader is now left with his most Critical attentive Judgment, to enjoy the benefit of the great Political knowledg that Sir <HI>William Petty</HI> hath taught the Age; and for which (as one of the greatest Orna|ments of it) he deserveth perpetual cele|brations.

<HEAD>Concerning the Late Rebellion.</HEAD>
<P>THE number of the People being now <HI>Anno</HI> 1672 about 1100,000. and <HI>Anno</HI> 1652. about 850 M. because I conceive that 80 M. of them have in 20 years encreased by Generation 70 M. by return of banish|ed and expelled <HI>English</HI>; as also by the ac|cess of new ones, 80 M. of New <HI>Scots,</HI> and 20 M. of returned <HI>Irish,</HI> being all 250 M.</P>
<P>Now if it could be known what number of people were in <HI>Ireland, Ann.</HI> 1641. then the difference between the said number, and 850, adding unto it the encrease by Genera|tion, in 11 years will shew the destructi|on of people made by the Wars, <HI>viz.</HI> by the Sword, Plague, and Famine occasioned thereby.</P>
<P>I find, by comparing superfluous and spare Oxen, Sheep, Butter and Beef, that
<PB N="18" REF="18">
there was exported above &frac13; more <HI>Ann.</HI> 1664. than in 1641. which shews there were &frac13; more of people, <HI>viz.</HI> 1466,000; Out of which Sum take what were left <HI>Ann.</HI> 1652. there will remain 616,000. destroyed by the Rebellion.</P>
<P>Whereas the present proportion of the <HI>British</HI> is as 3 to 11; But before the Wars the proportion was less, <HI>viz.</HI> as 2 to 11. and then it follows that the number of <HI>British</HI> slain in 11 years was 112 thousand Souls; of which I guess &frac23; to have perished by War, Plague and Famine. So as it follows that 37,000 were massacred in the first year of Tumults: So as those who think 154,000 were so destroyed, ought to review the grounds of their Opinion.</P>
<P>It follows also, that about 504 M. of the <HI>Irish</HI> perished, and were wasted by the Sword, Plague, Famine, Hardship and Ba|nishment, between the 23 of <HI>October</HI> 1641. and the same day 1652.</P>
<P>Wherefore those who say, That not &frac16; of them remained at the end of the Wars, must also review their opinions; there being by this Computation near &frac23; of them; which Opinion I also submit.</P>

<HEAD>Of the future Settlement of <HI>Ireland,</HI> Proro|gation of Rebellions, and its Union with <HI>England.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>English</HI> invaded <HI>Ireland</HI> about 500 years since; at which time, if the <HI>Irish</HI> were in number about 1,200,000. <HI>Anno</HI> 1641. they were but 600 M. in num|ber, 200 years ago, and not above 300,000 M. at the said time of their Invasion; for 300,000 people will, by the ordinary Course of Generation, become 1200 M. in 500 years; allowance being made for the Extraordinary Effects of Epidemical Diseases, Famines, Wars, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>There is at this Day no Monument or real Argument that, when the <HI>Irish</HI> were first invaded, they had any Stone-Housing at all, any Money, any Foreign Trade, nor any Learning but the Legend of the Saints, Psalters; Missals, Rituals, <HI>&amp;c. viz.</HI> nor Geometry, Astronomy, Anatomy, Archi|tecture, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nginery, Painting, Carving, nor any kind of Manufacture, nor the least use of Navigation, or the Art Military.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Iohn Davys</HI> hath expressed much Wit and Learning, in giving the Causes why <HI>Ireland</HI> was in no measure reduced to <HI>Eng|lish</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="22">
Government, till in Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> Reign, and since; and withal offers several means, whereby what yet remains to be done, may be still effected.</P>
<P>The Conquest made by the <HI>English,</HI> and described in the Preamble of the Act of Par|liament past <HI>Ann.</HI> 1662. for the Settlement of <HI>Ireland,</HI> gave means for any thing that had been reasonable of that kind; but their Forfeiters being abroad, and suffering with His Majesty from the same usurping hands, made some diversion.</P>
<P>Wherefore (<HI>Rebus sic stantibus</HI>) what is now to be done is the Question, <HI>viz.</HI> What may be done by natural possibility, if Au|thority saw it sit?</P>
<P>Some furious Spirits have wished, that the <HI>Irish</HI> would rebel again, that they might be put to the Sword. But I declare, that mo|tion to be not only impious and inhumane, but withal frivolous and pernicious even to them who have rashly wish'd for those occasions.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Irish</HI> will not easily rebel again, I believe from the memory of their former Successes, especially of the last, had not many Providences interpos'd; and withal from the consideration of these following Particulars, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="27" REF="22">1. That the <HI>British Protestants</HI> and <HI>Church</HI> have &frac34; of all the Lands; &frac56; of all the Housing; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> of all the Housing in wall'd Towns, and Places of strength &frac23; of the Foreign Trade. That 6 of 8 of all the <HI>Irish</HI> live in a brutish nasty Condition, as in Cabins, with neither Chimney, Door, Stairs nor Window; feed chiefly upon Milk and Potatoes, whereby their Spirits are not dispos'd for War. And that although there be in <HI>Ireland</HI> 8 <HI>Papists</HI> for 3 others; yet there are far more Soldi|ers, and Soldierlike-Men of this latter and lesser Number, than of the former.</P>
<P>That His Majesty, who formerly could do nothing for, and upon <HI>Ireland,</HI> but by the help of <HI>England,</HI> hath now a Revenue up|on the Place, to maintain, if he pleases, 7000 Men in Arms, besides a Protestant Mi|litia of 25000 more, the most whereof are expert in War.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Protestants</HI> have Housing e|nough within Places of strength within 5 Miles of the Sea-side; to receive and pro|tect, and harbour every Man, Woman and Child belonging to them, and have also places of strength of their own properly, so situate in all parts of <HI>Ireland,</HI> to which they can easily travel the shortest day of the year.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="23">That being able so to secure their Persons, even upon all sudden Emergencies, they can be easily supplied out of <HI>England</HI> with Food sufficient to maintain them, till they have burnt 160 M. of their afore-described Cabins, not worth 50 M. l. destroy'd their Stacks and Haggards of Corn, and distur|bed their Tillage, which the embody'd <HI>Bri|tish</HI> can soon and easily atchieve.</P>
<P>That a few Ships of War, whereof the <HI>Irish</HI> have none, nor no Skill or Practice of Navigation, can hinder their relief from all Foreign help.</P>
<P>That few Foreigners can help them if they would. But that none, not the King of <HI>France,</HI> can gain advantage by so doing, even tho he succeeded. For <HI>England</HI> hath constantly lost these 500 years by their med|ling with <HI>Ireland.</HI> And at this day, than when <HI>Ireland</HI> was never so rich and splen|did, it were the advantage of the <HI>English</HI> to abandon their whole Interest in that Coun|trey; and fatal to any other Nation to take it, as hath been elsewhere (as I think) de|monstrated; and the advantage of the Land|lords of <HI>England,</HI> to give them the Equiva|lent of what they should so quit out of their own Estates in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="23"><HI>Lastly,</HI> Let the <HI>Irish</HI> know, That there are, ever were, and will be men disconten|ted with their present Conditions in <HI>England,</HI> and ready for any Exploit and Change, more than are sufficient to quell any Insurrection they can make and abide by.</P>
<P>Wherefore, declining all Military means of setling and securing <HI>Ireland</HI> in peace and plenty, what we offer shall tend to the trans|muting one People into the other, and the thorough union of Interests upon natural and lasting Principles; of which I shall enume|rate several, tho seemingly never so uncouth and extravagant.</P>
<P N="1">1. If <HI>Henry</HI> the II. had or could have brought over all the people of <HI>Ireland</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> declining the Benefit of their Land; he had fortified, beautified and enrich'd <HI>England,</HI> and done real Kindness to the <HI>I|rish.</HI> But the same Work is near four times as hard now to be done as then; but it might be done, even now, with advantage to all Parties.</P>
<P>Whereas there are now 300 M. <HI>British,</HI> and 800 M. <HI>Papists,</HI> whereof 600 M. live in the wretched way above mentioned: If an Exchange was made of but about 200 M. <HI>I|rish,</HI> and the like number of <HI>British</HI> brought
<PB N="30" REF="24">
over in their rooms, then the natural strength of the <HI>British</HI> would be equal to that of the <HI>Irish</HI>; but their Political and Artifici|al strength three times as great; and so visi|ble, that the <HI>Irish</HI> would never stir upon a National or Religious Account.</P>
<P N="3">3. There are among the 600 M. above|mentioned of the poor <HI>Irish,</HI> not above 20 M. of unmarried marriageable Women; nor would above two thousand <HI>per Ann.</HI> grow and become such. Wherefore if &frac12; the said Women were in one year, and &frac12; the next transported into <HI>England,</HI> and disposed of one to each Parish, and as many <HI>English</HI> brought back and married to the <HI>Irish,</HI> as would improve their Dwelling but to an House and Garden of 3 l. value, the whole Work of natural Transmutation and Union would in 4 or 5 years be accomplished.</P>
<P>The charge of making the exchange would not be 20,000 l. <HI>per Ann.</HI> which is about 6 Weeks Pay of the present or late Ar|mies in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>If the <HI>Irish</HI> must have Priests, let the number of them, which is now between 2 and 3 thousand Secular and Regulars, be reduced to the competent number of 1000, which is 800 Souls to the pastorage of each Priest; which let be known persons, and
<PB N="31" REF="24">
<HI>English-men,</HI> if it may be. So as that when the Priests, who govern the Conscience, and the Women, who influence other pow|erful Appetites, shall be <HI>English,</HI> both of whom being in the Bosom of the Men, it must be, that no massacring of <HI>English,</HI> as heretofore, can happen again. Moreover, when the Language of the Children shall be <HI>English,</HI> and the whole Oeconomy of the Family <HI>English, viz.</HI> Diet, Apparel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Transmutation will be very easy and quick.</P>
<P>Add hereunto, That if both Kingdoms, now two, were put into one, and under one Legislative Power and Parliament, the Members whereof should be in the same pro|portion that the Power and Wealth of each Nation are, there would be no danger such a Parliament should do any thing to the pre|judice of the <HI>English</HI> Interest in <HI>Ireland</HI>; nor could the <HI>Irish</HI> ever complain of Partiality, when they shall be freely and proportionably represented in all Legislatures.</P>

<HEAD>The Inconveniencies of the Not-Union, and Absurdities seem to be these, <HI>viz.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. It is absurd, that <HI>English-men</HI> born, sent over into <HI>Ireland</HI> by the Commission
<PB N="32" REF="25">
of their own King, and there sacrificing their Lives for the King's Interest, and suc|ceeding in his Service, should therefore be accounted Aliens, Foreigners, and also Ene|mies, such as were the <HI>Irish</HI> before <HI>Henry</HI> the VII. time; whom, if an <HI>English-man</HI> had then killed, he had suffer'd nothing for it; for it is but Indulgence and Connivance, that now the same is not still in force. For such formerly was the Condition of <HI>Irish|men</HI>; and that of <HI>English-men</HI> is now the same, otherwise than as Custom has relie|ved them.</P>
<P>It is absurd, that the Inhabitants of <HI>Ire|land,</HI> naturally and necessarily bound to o|bey their Sovereign, should not be permit|ted to know who, or what the same is, <HI>i.e.</HI> Whether the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> or that of <HI>Ireland</HI>; and in what Cases the one, and in what the other. Which uncertainty is or may be made a pretence for my Disobe|dience.</P>
<P>It is absurd, that <HI>English-men</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> should either be Aliens there, or else to be bound to Laws, in the making whereof they are not represented.</P>
<P>It is absurd if the Legislative Power be in <HI>Ireland,</HI> that the final judgment of Causes between man and man, should be in <HI>England,
<PB N="33" REF="25">
viz.</HI> the Writs of Error should remove Cau|ses out of <HI>Ireland,</HI> to the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Bench</HI> in <HI>England.</HI> That the final determination of Admiralty-Causes, and of some Causes-Ec|clesiastical, should be also ended in <HI>England</HI>; nor that men should know whether the <HI>Chancery</HI> of <HI>England</HI> have jurisdiction in <HI>Ire|land</HI>; and whether the Decrees of <HI>Chancery</HI> in one <HI>Chancery,</HI> can be executed in the other.</P>
<P>As for Inconveniences, it is one, That we should do to Trade between the two King|doms, as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the <HI>West-Indies</HI> do to all other Nations; for which cause all other Nations have war with them there.</P>
<P>And that a Ship trading from <HI>Ireland</HI> in|to the Islands of <HI>America,</HI> should be forced to unlade the Commodities shipt for <HI>Ireland</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and afterwards bring them home; thereby necessitating the Owners of such Goods to run unnecessary hazard and Ex|pences.</P>
<P>It is inconvenient that the same King's Subjects should pay Customs as Aliens, passing from one part of the same their own King's Territories to another.</P>
<P>The chief Objection against the remedy of these Evils is;</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="26">That his Majesty would by the Union lose much of his Double-Customs. Which being true, let's see what the same amounts unto; and if it be sufficient to hinder the remedy of these Evils, and if it be irrepa|rable by some other way.</P>
<P><HI>Ann.</HI> 1664. which was the best year of Trade that hath been these many years in <HI>Ireland,</HI> when neither Plague nor Wars im|peached it, and when men were generally disposed to Splendor and Liberality, and when the Act for hindring Cattel coming out of <HI>Ireland</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> was not yet made; nor that made for unlading in <HI>Eng|land</HI> Ships bound from <HI>America</HI> into <HI>Ireland</HI>; I say, in that year the Customs upon expor|ted and imported Commodities, between <HI>Ireland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> was but &mdash;but not &frac16; thereof, which since, how easily may it be added to the other Charges upon <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> which are together perhaps 1500 M. <HI>per Ann</HI>?</P>
<P N="2">2. If it be for the good of <HI>England</HI> to keep <HI>Ireland</HI> a distinct Kingdom, why do not the predominant Party in Parliament (suppose the <HI>Western</HI> Members) make <HI>Eng|land</HI> beyond <HI>Trent</HI> another Kingdom, under Commerce, and take Tolls and Customs upon the new Borders? Or why was there
<PB N="35" REF="26">
ever a Union between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales,</HI> the good effects and fruits whereof were ne|ver questioned? And why may not the en|tire Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> be farther Can|toniz'd, and infinitely for the advantage of Parties?</P>
<P>As for the Practice; The Peers of <HI>Ireland</HI> assembled in Parliament, may depute so ma|ny of their number, as make the &frac18; part of the Peers of <HI>England,</HI> to be call'd by Writ into the Lords House of <HI>England</HI>: And the Commons in <HI>Ireland,</HI> assembled in like man|ner, may depute the like proportion of other Members to sit with the Commons of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> the King and that House admitting of them.</P>
<P>But if the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> be al|ready the Legislative Power of <HI>Ireland,</HI> why may they not call a competent Number out of <HI>Ireland,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, or in some other more convenient manner?</P>
<P>All these Shifts and Expedients are neces|sary but for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, until the matter be agreed upon by both Nations, in some one Parliament.</P>
<P>'Tis s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ppos'd that the Wealth of <HI>Ireland</HI> is about the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of that of <HI>England</HI>; and the King's Revenue in both Kingdoms seems about that proportion.</P>

<P>The Chief Governour, called sometimes Lord-Lieutenant, sometimes Lord-Deputy, sometimes Lords Justices, with a Coun|cil, at this time consisting of about 50 Mem|bers,

The <HI>Common-Pleas</HI> of the like: The Exchequer, of a Lord-Chief-Baron, and two other Barons, with the Treasurer and Chan|cellor of the <HI>Exchequer:</HI> And a Preroga|tive, whereof the Primate of <HI>Armagh</HI> is Judge.</P>
<P>There is also a Palatinate-Courtih <HI>Tippe|rary,</HI> whereof the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> is Lord of the Liberties and Regalities to it belong|ing. There is also a Court of <HI>Admiralty</HI>: Every Bishop hath also two Courts.

<P>There is also a Court-<HI>Marshal,</HI> for the Affairs of the Army, who in times of peace often transmit accus'd persons to the Civil-power.</P>

<P>There are in <HI>Ireland</HI> about 950 Justices of the Peace, appointed by the Lord-Chan|cellor; an Head-Constable for each Barony or Hundred, being 252; and a Petty Con|stable for each Parish; whereof are about 2278.</P>
<P>The Ecclesiastical Government is by Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Arch-Deacons, Deans of Cathedral-Churches, in all which there are now actually but one Quire entire, and that in <HI>Dublin,</HI> serving both at <HI>Christ-Church,</HI> and St. <HI>Patrick</HI>'s. And the Parsons, Vicars and Curates for the <HI>Protestant-Re|ligion,</HI> are in all <HI>Ireland</HI> at this day near 500, and about half the Tythes are Impropriate, and belonging to Lay-men.</P>
<P>This is the State of the External and Ap|parent Government of <HI>Ireland,</HI> so far as it concerns the Number and Species of Persons managing the same. But the Internal and Mystical Government of <HI>Ireland</HI> is thus, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="39" REF="28">1. There are always about Twenty Gen|tlemen of the <HI>Irish</HI> Nation and <HI>Popish-Reli|gion,</HI> who by reason of their Families, good Parts, Courtly Education and Carriage, are supported by the <HI>Irish</HI> to negotiate their Concernments at the Court of <HI>England,</HI> and of the Vice-Roy in <HI>Ireland</HI></P>
<P>These men raise their Contributions by the Priests (who actually and immediately govern the People.) The Priests are go|vern'd by at least 24 <HI>Romish</HI> Bishops, all of whom have a long time been conversant in <HI>France, Spain, Italy, Germany, England,</HI> whereas Chaplains and Almoners, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they have made an interest with the governing Men and Ministers of State in those several Kingdoms, and have obtained some Benefits and Preferments from them.</P>
<P>So as the Body of the <HI>Irish-Papist's</HI> (being about 800 M. whereof near 700 M. do live in wretched Cabbins, without Chimney or Window) are govern'd by about 1000 Se|cular Priests, and 2500 Friars and Regulars of several Orders; whereof most are <HI>Fran|ciscans,</HI> next <HI>Dominicans</HI> and <HI>Augustins,</HI> but few <HI>Capuchins</HI> and <HI>Iesuits</HI> or <HI>Carthusians.</HI> These, I say, are govern'd by their respe|ctive Bishops and Superiors, whom the Mi|nisters
<PB N="40" REF="29">
of Foreign States do also govern and direct.</P>
<P>So as upon the whole matter, the <HI>Irish,</HI> who are the Bulk of the Nation, are go|vern'd indirectly by Foreign Power; and so are the aforenamed Lay-Patriots, their support coming from the Clergy con|stituted as aforesaid, and who do notorious|ly exercise their Spiritual Jurisdiction in <HI>Ire|land</HI>: And do also exert a Temporal Power, by prevailing with <HI>Papist</HI> Justices of the Peace, to send such to Gaol as are disobedi|ent to the Clergy, upon feigned or frivolous Complaints, which they cause to be brought against them.</P>
<P>The Judges aforenamed, all but the Chancellor, go Circuits, whereof there are five twice every year, excepting only the one County of <HI>Kerry.</HI></P>
<P>There is an University at <HI>Dublin,</HI> but lying for the most part within one College, wherein are a Provost and seven Senior and Ruling Fellows; Nine Junior Fellows; sixty Sch lars; and at this time &mdash; Commoners and other Students</P>

<P><PB N="41" REF="29">There are belonging to the Prerogative, Arch-Deacons Courts, Court-Martial and Admiralty-Courts, not above to Advocates, and 30 Proctors.</P>

<P>There are in and near <HI>Dublin,</HI> three Pub|lick Prisons, and one House of Correction.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> I must intimate, that the Foot|manship for which the <HI>Irish</HI> 40 years agone were very famous, is now almost quite lost among them, every man now keeping a small Garran to ride on, unless in such rocky and craggy places, where 'tis easier to go a foot than to ride.</P>

And the chief Pique which the <HI>Po|pish-Clergy</HI> have at the <HI>Protestants</HI> is, that they have the Church Livings and Jurisdict|ions; for the exercise of their Function they have most freely, and had, when they under|took their Project in 1641. The differences between the Old <HI>Irish,</HI> and Old <HI>English Papists</HI> is asleep now, because they have a Common Enemy.</P>
<P>The Old <HI>Protestants</HI> of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and King <HI>Iames</HI>'s Plantation (till of late) did not much love the New <HI>English</HI>; who came over since 1641. or rather since 1646. &amp; 1648. because they envied the great Shares which they had gotten of the forfeited Lands from the Late Usurpers. But now they also are well enough together, since the said Old Protestants have had good Proviso's in the Acts of Settlement and Satisfaction for their Service before <HI>Iune</HI> 1649. and since the Church-Revenues have been augmented by the Forfeitures; but chiefly, for that the said Old <HI>Protestants</HI> have all the Power and Preferments Civil, Military, and Ecclesia|stical.</P>
<P>Of the New <HI>English,</HI> some are <HI>Confor|mists,</HI> others not: And some have fallen in with other Parties, and others not.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="31">Of the Old Protestants, there are also Parties, I cannot say Factions, chiefly de|nominated by the Names of their Families, as the <HI>Butlers</HI> and <HI>Fitz-Gerralds</HI> were of old.</P>
<P>But to return; The chief Factions are the vested and devested of forfeited Lands: all <HI>Irish</HI> and <HI>Papists</HI> generally fearing the latter, and most <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Protestants</HI> the former, as appears in all Juries and Testi|monies given where the Lands or Lives of one or other are concerned. Now in some Counties, as in <HI>Kerry,</HI> many Forfeitures happened, and few Restorations, and there also few <HI>English</HI> were ever planted, nor can well endure to live: So as the first sort of Militia in these and other like Counties, are <HI>Irish-Papists,</HI> devested and discontented Persons. Whereby the few <HI>English</HI> there, can have no Justice executed, for want of hand wherewith to do it: Nor can they ea|sily get indifferent Juries, but that the She|riffs are <HI>English</HI> for the most part, and most commonly Protestants. In which Case, some have been of opinion, that the other Militia, namely the Army, may both in Law and Reason supply this defect in times when there is not occasion for them, to guard the Land from Invasion and Rebelli|on.
<PB N="45" REF="31">
For why might not 30 Sheriffs be ta|ken out of 120 Officers of the Army, <HI>viz.</HI> 60 Captains and Lieutenants of Horse, and 60 Captains of Foot? And why may not such be as responsible for executing just Sentences, as any other? And what Tenor is there in the Force which a Bailiff useth, more than in that which one call'd a Soldier carries with him. And why should the Military Officer or Sheriff use more force or terror than to make the Debtor or Malefa|ctor answer the Law, and obey the Sentence of a Civil Court? And is it not more con|venient and easy in great riotous Contempts, to bring a Troop or Company, whose Trade it is to use Arms and apply Force dexterously, than to use the <HI>Posse-Comita|tus</HI>; that is, to call abundance of men from their Labour and Calling, to attempt things of Danger, which they do not understand? Moreover, if the General can quarter the Army where he pleases, and that the She|riffs or Constable can, in their respective Precincts, call whom he pleases to his assi|stance; then the General can cause such a competent Force to be quartered in those thin peopled Counties. And the Sheriffs and Justices can call such to their assistance, excepting where such Soldiers are in formal
<PB N="46" REF="32">
Garisons upon actual Duty, or in other ca|ses to be agreed upon between the Civil and Military Powers so call'd, although there can be no Countrey without Force, nor any Army without a Policy and Discipline. But of this let the Lawyers talk further.</P>
<P>As for the Military Force of <HI>Ireland,</HI> vul|garly and properly so call'd, 1. The stand|ing Army is such as the present Revenue can well maintain, which perhaps is, or very lately was about 6000, and is every year or other year changed, as to his Maje|sty seems best. 2. The Protestant Militia now already established and formed, is a|bout 24 or 25 thousand men, most of them already experienc'd in the Wars of <HI>Ire|land.</HI></P>
<P>The Third, of grand Force against Fo|reign Invasions, I conceive may be 70 M. Men of the best affected, and least Pope|affected <HI>Irish</HI>; for so many I conceive the 30000 of the standing Army and present Militia could well Officer and Command. Now that 100 M. may be spar'd to send as Soldiers in a time of extremity, I think it plain, for that there are 550 M. Males in <HI>Ireland,</HI> whereof 150 M. can perform all the necessary Labor of Husbandmen and Trades-men; 200 M. of them are perhaps un|der
<PB N="47" REF="32">
16, and above 60. Nor doth the quali|ty of the remaining, exempt them from ser|vice, who are to stand for a reserve.</P>
<P>And this Force I take to be sufficient to resist any number of men which any Prince of the World hath Shipping enough to bring into <HI>Ireland,</HI> with such Horse, Arms, Ammunition and Victuals as are for such an Enterprize.</P>
<P>To say nothing, that the substance of <HI>Ire|land</HI> is chiefly Cattel, which be easily remo|ved to waste the Countrey where the Ene|my shall land.</P>
<P>And how considerable the standing Ar|my of 6000 men, and the Veteran Militia, of above 24000, who have not only the Command, but the possession and proprie|ty of all the strong and terrible Places in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and &frac34; of all the Horse serviceable in War, and at least &frac34; of all Shipping, and <HI>England</HI> to help and countenance, hath been competently mentioned before; and that the Bulk of the <HI>Irish</HI> are the Inhabi|tants of the aforenamed 160 M. wretched Cabins-men, slavishly bred and dealt with by their own Lords and Patriots; and that the restored <HI>Irish,</HI> restored to their Estates almost by Miracle, will be careful how they engage any more upon a frivolous, impious Undertaking.</P>

That the Gallon of Milk comes but to a Farthing, expecting what the value and hazard of the Cow, and the labour of milking and looking to her, shall add unto that price; which I suppose not a|bove as much more.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="35">The said quantity of Milk will make 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> C. of Raw-Milk-Cheese, and 1 C. of Whey-Butter, besides Whey for the Swine: Or else 2 C. of Butter, and 1 C. of Skim-Milk-Cheese, besides Whey as abovesaid, for Drink to the People, and Food for Swine.</P>

<P>THE value or proportion of the several Counties in <HI>Ireland,</HI> doth seem much to depend upon the number of Acres which each doth contain. And therefore, and for several other Reasons, most of the Land of <HI>Ireland</HI> hath,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>By Sir</HI> John Bod|ly.</NOTE> within these last 10 years, been admeasured by the Chain and Instru|ment, <HI>viz.</HI> The King and Queens Counties, about the Year 1630. The County of <HI>Londonderry,</HI> when the City of <HI>London</HI> un|dertook the Plantation by one Mr. <HI>Raven; Connought</HI> and <HI>Tipperary,</HI> in the Earl of <HI>Straf|ford</HI>'s time, by several hands, sometimes conducted by Mr. <HI>William Gilbert.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="38">The Lands belonging to Papists <HI>Ann.</HI> 1641. in the three Provinces of <HI>Munster, Lem|ster</HI> and <HI>Vlster,</HI> by Sir <HI>William Petty.</HI> Other Protestant Lands in the same three Provin|ces, in order to regulate Contributions, by the Owners of the said Lands themselves: But in so divided and separated a manner, that little Accompt can be given of them, besides what was collected by the said Sir <HI>William Petty</HI>; who at his own charge, be|sides those Maps of every Parish, which by his Agreement he delivered into the Surveyor-General's Office, he hath caused distinct Maps to be made of every Barony, or Hundred; as also of every County, en|graven in Copper, and the like of every Province, and of the whole Kingdom. All which, could the Defects of them be sup|plied with the yet unmeasured&punc; Lands, would be exposed to publick view.</P>
<P>Now as to the value of these Lands, they were <HI>Ann.</HI> 1642. rated to and by the Adventurers as followeth, <HI>viz.</HI> in <HI>Lemster</HI> at 12 s. <HI>per</HI> Acre; in <HI>Munster</HI> at 9 s. in <HI>Con|naught</HI> at 6 s. and in <HI>Vlster</HI> at 4 s. and to pay 1 Farthing <HI>per Ann.</HI> Quit-rent to the King out of each Shillings-worth of Land so ra|ted, <HI>viz.</HI> 3 d. or 12 Farthings for an Acre in <HI>Lemster</HI> rated at 12. s. 9 q. or 2&frac14; an Acre
<PB N="60" REF="39">

<P>Afterwards the Soldiers, who were to have the satisfaction of their Arrears at the same rate, not being willing to cast Lots upon such desperate hazards, did <HI>Ann.</HI> 1653. equalize Counties within each Province, <HI>viz.</HI> took some in <HI>Lemster,</HI> at 1 l. 2 s. <HI>per</HI> Acre, some at 1 l. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And those who were satisfied <HI>Ann.</HI> 1655. and afterwards, did equalize not only Counties, but Baronies also, valuing some Baronies in <HI>Lemster</HI> at 1 l. 4 s. <HI>per</HI> Acre, and some but at 6 s. and others at all rates between these two ex|treams. But so as that, notwithstanding all the said differences, the whole Province should be given and taken at 12 s. <HI>per</HI> Acre, according to the then Law. And the Ine|quality remaining after this Equalization, was to be corrected by a Lot.</P>
<P>I could here insert all the particulars of these Transactions, but conceive it imperti|nent to my purpose, especially since they may be seen upon Record. The next and best of all preceding equalization, was that which the Concernees of each County made in order to regulate the heavy Contri|butions paid to the Usurpers before His Ma|jesties
<PB N="61" REF="39">
Restoration, and when no Quit-Rent was yet due. And in order to this work, not Baronies as before, but Parishes, nay, particular Farms were also equalized. What was done herein, was not publickly recorded, but collected by the curious, and too Bulky to be here inserted. Only take notice, that these Valuations were made as Parties inte|rested could prevail upon and against one another by their Attendance, Friends, Elo|quence, and Vehemence; for what other Foun|dation of Truth it had in Nature, I know not.</P>
<P>Next to this Valuation, there was, in or|der to a certain Gift presented to His Maje|sty, by the Adventurers and Soldiers, of a years value of all their Lands as it yielded <HI>Ann.</HI> 1659. next immediately before his Restoration. There issued a Commission, <HI>Ann.</HI> 1663. to enquire and settle the said Values. And about 1667. there were made two several Valuations more; the one in order to reprize such who had restored Lands to the Innocent <HI>Irish</HI> in equal value; and another was a Determination what each Land was worth <HI>Ann.</HI> 1659. (what|ever it yielded): Both which, especially the latter, are upon Record most authentically. Moreover, <HI>Ann.</HI> 1653, and 1654. there were Inquisitions taken of the Values which
<PB N="62" REF="40">
all and every parcel of Land in <HI>Ireland</HI> yiel|ded <HI>Ann.</HI> 1641. There have been also several Acts of the chief Powers <HI>pro tem|pore,</HI> for apportioning what proportion of a certain Sum to be levied in general, should in particular be charg'd on each County, <HI>viz.

And <HI>Ann.</HI> 1672. for the equal raising of 30000 l. <HI>per Ann.</HI> upon all the Lands and Houses of the whole Na|tion.

and quality of the Land what it will. 2. That in the meanest of the 160 M. Cabbins, one with another are five Souls, in the 24000 six Souls. In all the other Houses Ten a piece, one with another.</P>

<HEAD>The TABLE.</HEAD>
<P>BUT to make nearer approaches to the perfection of this Work, 'twould be expedient to know the Content of Acres of every Parish, and withal, what quantity of Butter, Cheese, Corn, and Wooll, was raised out of it for three years consequent; for thence the natural Value of the Land may be known, and by the number of People li|ving within a Market-days Journey, and the Value of their housing, which shews the Quality and Expence of the said Peo|ple; I would hope to come to the know|ledg of the Value of the said Commodities, and consequently the Value of the Land, by deducting the hire of Working-People in it. And this brings me to the most im|portant Consideration in Political Oecono|mies, <HI>viz.</HI> how to make a <HI>Par</HI> and <HI>Equa|tion</HI> between Lands and Labour, so as to express the Value of any thing by either
<PB N="64" REF="41">
alone. To which purpose, suppose two Acres of Pasture-land inclosed, and put thereinto a wean'd Calf, which I suppose in twelve Months will become 1 C. hea|vier in eatable Flesh; then 1 C. weight of such Flesh, which I suppose fifty days Food, and the Interest of the Value of the Calf, is the value or years Rent of the Land. But if a Mans labour &mdash; for a year can make the said Land to yield more than sixty days Food of the same, or of any other kind, then that overplus of days food is the Wages of the Man; both being expressed by the number of days food. That some Men will eat more than o|thers, is not material, since by a days food we understand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> part of what 100 of all Sorts and Sizes will eat, so as to Live, La|bour, and Generate. And that a days food of one sort, may require more labour to produce, than another sort, is also not material, since we understand the easiest-gotten food of the respective Countries of the World.</P>
<P>As for example, I suppose a pint of Oatmeal equal to half a pint of Rice, or a quart of Milk, or a pound of Bread, or a pound and quarter of Flesh, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> each, in the respective place where each is the
<PB N="65" REF="41">
easiest gotten food. But if Rice be brought out of <HI>India</HI> into <HI>Ireland,</HI> or Oatmeal carri|ed from <HI>Ireland</HI> thither; then in <HI>India</HI> the pint of Oatmeal must be dearer than half a pint of Rice, by the freight and hazard of Carriage, <HI>&amp; vice-versa, &amp; sic de caeteris.</HI> For, as for pleasant tast, I question whe|ther there be any certainty, or regularity of the same in Nature, the same depending upon Novelty, opinion of Virtue, the re|commendation of others, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Wherefore the days food of an adult Man, at a Medi|um, and not the days labour, is the com|mon measure of Value, and seems to be as regular and constant as the value of fine Silver. For an ounce, suppose, of Silver in <HI>Peru</HI> is equivalent to a days food, but the same in <HI>Russia</HI> is equivalent to four days food, by reason of the Freight, and hazard in carrying the same from <HI>Peru</HI> to <HI>Russia</HI>; and in <HI>Russia</HI> the price of Silver shall grow to be worth more days labour, if a Workman can by the esteem and request of Silver Utensils earn more than he can on other materials. Wherefore I valued an <HI>Irish</HI> Cabbin at the number of days food, which the Maker spent in building of it.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="42">By the same way we must make a Par and Equation between Art and Simple La|bour; for if by such Simple Labour I could dig and prepare for Seed a hundred Acres in a thousand days; suppose then, I spend a hundred days in studying a more com|pendious way, and in contriving Tools for the same purpose; but in all that hun|dred days dig nothing, but in the remaining nine hundred days I dig two hundred Acres of Ground; then I say, that the said Art which cost but one hundred days Invention is worth one Mans labour for ever; because the now Art, and one Man, perform'd as much as two Men could have done with|out it.</P>
<P>By the same way we make an Equation between Art and Opinion. For if a Pi|cture-maker, suppose, make Pictures at 5 <HI>l.</HI> each; but then, find that more Persons would employ him at that rate than his time would extend to serve them in, it will certainly come to pass that this Artist will consider whether as many of those who ap|ply to him at 5 <HI>l.</HI> each Picture, will give 6 <HI>l.</HI> as will take up his whole time to accommo|date; and upon this Computation he pitch|eth the Rate of his Work.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="42">By the same way also an Equation may be made between drudging Labour, and Favour, Acquaintance, Interest, Friends, Eloquence, Reputation, Power, Authori|ty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> All which I thought not amiss to intimate as of the same kind with find|ing an Equation between Land and La|bour, all these not very pertinent to the Proportionation of the several Counties of <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore to return to the matter in hand, I say, that the Quantity of Com|modity produced, and the Quantity of the &mdash; shews the effects of the Land; and the number of People living thereupon, with the Quality of their housing, shews the Value of the Commodity; for one days delicate and exquisit Food may be worth ten of ordinary. Now the Nature of Peo|ples feeding may be estimated by the vi|sible part of their Expence, which is their housing. But such helps of knowing the Value of Lands, I am not yet able to furnish.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Money of <HI>IRELAND.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MOney is understood to be the uniform Measure and Rule for the Value of all Commodities. But whether in that sence there be any Money, or such Rule in the World, I know not, much less in <HI>Ireland,</HI> tho most are perswaded that Gold and Silver Money is such. For 1. The proportion of value between pure Gold and fine Silver, alters as the Earth and Industry of Men produce more of one than of the other; that is to say, Gold has been worth but twelve times its own weight in Silver; of late it has been worth fourteen, because more Silver has been got|ten. That of Gold proportionably, <HI>i. e.</HI> a|bout twelve times as much Silver has been raised as of Gold, which makes Gold dear|er. So there can be but one of the two Metals of Gold and Silver to be a fit mat|ter for Money. Wherefore, if Silver be that one Metal fit for Money; then Gold is but a Commodity very like Money. And as things now stand, Silver only is the mat|ter of Money; and that elsewhere as well as in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="69" REF="43">2. The value of Silver rises and falls it self; for Men make Vessels of coyned Sil|ver, if they can gain by the Workmanship enough to defray the Destruction of the Coynage, and withal, more than they could expect by employing the same Silver as Money in a way of Trade. Now the Accidents of so doing, make Silver rise and fall, and consequently take from the per|fect Aptitude for being an uniform steady Rule and Measure of all other things.</P>
<P>The Mischiefs and Inconveniences hither|to mentioned, are common to all times and places; but in <HI>Ireland</HI> are more particular; and stand thus, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>A piece of 8 Rials being full 17. penny weight, passeth for 4 <HI>s.</HI> 9 <HI>d.</HI> if it want but &frac12; a grain of the weight, tho half a grain of Sil|ver be worth but the &frac14; of a Farthing, or &frac16; of a Penny, then it passes for 3 <HI>d</HI> less, <HI>viz.</HI> 4 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> and if it weigh ten grains above 17 <HI>d.</HI> weight, it passes but for 4 <HI>s.</HI> 9 <HI>d.</HI> On the other hand, if it weigh but 12 <HI>d.</HI> weight, it passes nevertheless for 4 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> And if the Silver be course, if not so course, as not to be called Silver, yet still it passes for the same Moreover, the fineness cannot be de|termined by common Eyes scarce at all, by the best not within 4 <HI>d.</HI> in an Ounce,
<PB N="70" REF="44">
by the Touchstone not within 2 <HI>d.</HI> and by the Test it self not within an half-penny. Lastly, The Scales and Weights differ so much from each other, as what is 4 <HI>s.</HI> 9 <HI>d.</HI> in one House, is but 4 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> in the next, <HI>&amp; vice versa.</HI> From whence it comes to pass, that all pieces weighing above 17 <HI>d.</HI> weight, are cull'd out to buy or make pieces of 14 <HI>d.</HI> weight pass for 4 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Other Species of Coyn, which <HI>pro rata</HI> contain the same quantity of the like Gold and Silver, with the piece of eight Rials, goes in one Species for more, in another for less. What hath been said of the Silver-species, may be said of the Gold-species; and what differences are between Silver and Silver, and between Gold and Gold, is also between Silver and Gold Coyns. So as it becomes a Trade to study and make Advantages of these Irregu|larities, to the prejudice of the good Peo|ple, who are taught, that whatever is called Money, is the same, and regu|lar, and uniform, and a just Measure of all Commodities. From whence it hath hap|pened, that all <HI>English</HI> Money which hath a great and deserved Reputation in the World for its intrinsick Goodness, is quite carried away out of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and such Mo|ney
<PB N="71" REF="44">
brought instead of it, as these studied Merchants do from time to time bring in for their Advantage upon the Common People, their Credulity and Ignorance.</P>
<P>But Money, that is to say, Silver and Gold, do at this day much decrease in <HI>Ire|land,</HI> for the following Reasons.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Ireland, Anno</HI> 1664. did not export to a much greater Value than it imported, <HI>viz.</HI> about 62 M. Since which time there hath been a Law made to prohibit the Im|portation of great Cattel and Sheep, alive or dead, into <HI>England</HI>; the Value whereof carried into <HI>England</HI> in that very year 1664. was above 150 M.<HI>l.</HI> The which was said to have been done, for that <HI>Ireland</HI> drained away the Money of <HI>England.</HI> Whereas in that very year <HI>England</HI> sent to <HI>Ireland,</HI> but 91 M. less than it received from thence; and yet this small difference was said to be the reason why the Rents of <HI>England</HI> fell &frac25;, that is 1600 M. in 8 Millions. Which was a strange conceit, if they consider far|ther, That the value of the Catrel alive or dead, which went out of <HI>Ireland</HI> into <HI>Eng|land,</HI> was but 132 M. the Hides, Tallow, and Freight whereof were worth about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that Money.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="72" REF="45">2. Whereas the Owners of about &frac14;, both of all the real and personal Estate of <HI>Ire|land,</HI> do live in <HI>England,</HI> since the busi|ness of the several Courts of Claims was finished in <HI>December</HI> 1668. all that belongs to them goes out, but returns not.</P>
<P N="3">3. The gains of the Commissioners of that Court, and of the Farmers of the Revenue of <HI>Ireland,</HI> who live in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> have issued out of <HI>Ireland</HI> without re|turns.</P>
<P N="4">4. A considerable part of the Army of <HI>Ireland</HI> hath been sent into <HI>England,</HI> and yet paid out of <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. To remit so many great Sums out of <HI>Ireland</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> when all Trade be|tween the said two Kingdoms is prohibi|ted, must be very chargeable; for now the Goods which go out of <HI>Ireland,</HI> in or|der to furnish the said Sums in <HI>England,</HI> must for Example go into the <HI>Barbados,</HI> and there be sold for Sugars, which brought into <HI>England,</HI> are sold for Money to pay there what <HI>Ireland</HI> owes. Which way be|ing so long, tedious and hazardous, must necessarily so raise the exchange of Money, as we have seen 15 <HI>per Cent.</HI> frequently gi|ven, <HI>Anno</HI> 1671, and <HI>Anno</HI> 1672. Altho in truth, exchange can never be naturally
<PB N="73" REF="45">
more than the Land and Water-carriage of Money between the two Kingdoms, and the ensurance of the same upon the way, if the Money be alike in both places.</P>
<P>But Men that have not had the faculty of making these Transmissions with dexte|rity, have chose rather to give 15. <HI>per Cent.</HI> Exchange, as aforesaid, than to put them|selves upon the hazard of such underta|kings, and the mischief of being disap|pointed.</P>
<P>Now the extraordinary decrease of Gold and Silver, put Men, whose Affairs were much disturb'd, thereby upon extraordi|nary Conceits, and some very absurd ones for Remedy, as namely the raising of <HI>Spa|nish</HI> pieces of Eight, called Cobs in <HI>Ireland,</HI> from 4 <HI>s.</HI> 9 <HI>d.</HI> to 5 or 6 Shillings, which were before about 5 <HI>d.</HI> above the Value of <HI>English,</HI> that is 4 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d. English</HI> Money weighed the same with a Cob called 4 <HI>s.</HI> 9 <HI>d.</HI> For these distracted People thought, that calling their Money by a better Name, did encrease its value.</P>
<P N="2">2. They thought that no Man would carry Cobs of 5 <HI>s.</HI> out of <HI>Ireland</HI> into <HI>Eng|land,</HI> where they were called but 4 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI> altho he was necessitated to pay 4 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI> in
<PB N="74" REF="46">
<HI>England,</HI> and had no other effects to do it with. They thought that all Men who lived in <HI>England,</HI> would return to their Estates in <HI>Ireland,</HI> rather than pay 15. <HI>per Cent.</HI> for Exchange; not considering, that when Cobs were raised, that Exchange would also rise proportionably. They fancied, that he who sold a Stone of Wooll for two Cobs, call'd 9 <HI>s.</HI> when Cobs were rais'd, would sell his Stone of Wooll of 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Cob when called 9 <HI>s.</HI> Nor did they think how this frivolous conceit would have taken away a proportionable part of all Land-lords Estates in <HI>Ireland.</HI> As for Example, those who acted moderately, would have the Money rais'd 1/20 part, and the 1/20 part of all the Money of <HI>Ireland,</HI> was then thought to be but about 20,000 <HI>l.</HI> The whole Cash of <HI>Ireland</HI> being then estimated, but 400 M.<HI>l.</HI> whereas the Landlords of <HI>Ireland,</HI> whose Revenue is 800 M. <HI>l. per Annum,</HI> must have lost 1/20 part of their whole Estates for ever, <HI>viz.</HI> 40 M. <HI>l. per Annum</HI> upon that empty expedient.</P>
<P>But others, no less sensible of the distress of the People, and the obstructions of Trade by reason of the said decay of Bulli|on, considering that about 600 M. <HI>l.</HI> would drive the Trade of that Kingdom; for
<PB N="75" REF="46">
that 300 M. would pay one half years Gale of all the Land; 50 M. would pay &frac14; rent of all the Housing, and that 150 M. would more than pay a Weeks expence of all the People of <HI>Ireland</HI>; and that the whole Cash moved chiefly in those Three Circles; They therefore thought to make up their 400 M. <HI>l.</HI> present Cash by a Bank of 200 M. <HI>l.</HI> more, the bot|tom and support whereof should be Land; for the Lands and Houses of <HI>Ireland</HI> be|ing worth about 8 Millions, whereof 200 M. <HI>l.</HI> was but the 1/4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> part. 'Twas thought easy to find many Fortieth parts so free from Incumbrances or question as to give a being to such a Bank.</P>
<P>Note, that Interest in <HI>Ireland</HI> is 10 <HI>per</HI> Cent, which is a great hinderance to Trade; since the Interest must enflame the price of <HI>Irish</HI> Commodities, and consequently give to other Nations the means of un|derselling.</P>

<P>IF it be true, that there are but about 16,000 Families in <HI>Ireland,</HI> who have above one Chimney in their Houses; and
<PB N="76" REF="47">
above 180 M. others; It will be easily un|derstood what the Trade of this latter sort can be, who use few Commodities; and those such as almost every one can make and produce. That is to say, Men live in such Cottages as themselves can make in 3 or 4 Days; Eat such Food (Tobacco ex|cep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed) as they buy not from others; wear such Cloaths as the Wool of their own Sheep, spun into Yarn by themselves, doth make; their Shoes, called Brogues, are but &frac14; so much worth as a Pair of <HI>English</HI> Shoes; nor of more than &frac14; in real use and value. A Hat costs 20 <HI>d.</HI> a Pair of Stockins 6 <HI>d.</HI> but a good Shirt near 3 <HI>s.</HI> The Taylors work of a Doublet, Breeches and Coat, about 2 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> In brief, the Victuals of a Man, his Wife, Three Children, and Servant, resolved into Money, may be estimated 3 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d. per</HI> Week, or 1 <HI>d. per</HI> Diem. The Cloaths of a Man 30 <HI>s. per Ann.</HI> of Children under 16, one with another 15 <HI>s.</HI> the House not worth 5 <HI>s.</HI> the Building; Fuel costs nothing but fetch|ing. So as the whole Annual expen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of such a Family, consisting of 6 in Number, seems to be but about 52 Shillings <HI>per Ann.</HI> each head one with another. So as 950. M. Inhabitants of these Edifices, may spend 2,375. M. <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> And the 150,000
<PB N="77" REF="47">
who inhabit the 16,000 other Houses, may spend 10 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> each one with another, <HI>viz.</HI> One Million and half. So as the whole People of both sorts spend under 4 Millions, whereof 1/10 part, <HI>viz.</HI> 400 M. <HI>l.</HI> is for For|reign Commodities, Tobacco included, whereof every 1000 Souls spend one Tun <HI>per Ann.</HI> or every 1000 Tobacco-takers, <HI>viz.</HI> People above 15. Years old, spend two Tuns one with another: for it appears by the latest accompt of importance, that what is here said, is true to a trifle. From whence I observe by the way, that the King's Revenue, <HI>viis &amp; modis,</HI> being about 200 M. <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> that it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> part of the whole Expence; which in some of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Commonwealths was thought too much, although the <HI>Israelites</HI> allowed 1/10 to the <HI>Levites</HI> only, tho perhaps to defray the whole charge of the Government, the Su|premacy amongst that People being then Sacerdotal.</P>
<P>I observe also by the way, that the Lands and Housing of <HI>Ireland</HI> being worth about one Million <HI>per Ann.</HI> that the Labour of the People may be worth three Millions, which is earned by about 750,000 (of the 1,100 M.) who by their Age and Quality are Fit and Applicable to Corporal La|bours,
<PB N="78" REF="48">
and consequently each Labouring Person Earns but 4 <HI>s. per Ann.</HI> if all Work. Or if each earns 8 <HI>l.</HI> then but half of them work, or all but half their full time, or o|therwise in other proportions. But be it one way or the other; I am as certain that the Hands of <HI>Ireland</HI> may Earn a Million <HI>per Ann.</HI> more than they now do, as I am cer|tain that there are 750,000 in <HI>Ireland</HI> who could earn 2 <HI>s.</HI> a week, or 5 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> one with another, if they had sutable employ|ment, and were kept to their Labour.</P>
<P>I further observe, that if there be natu|rally but 2000 Impotents in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and that 50 Shillings <HI>per Ann.</HI> doth maintain the poorer sort of People; It follows, that 8,000 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> would amply maintain all the Impotent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of <HI>Ireland,</HI> if well apply'd. For other Beggers, as also Thieves, and Rebels, which are but bigger Thieves, are probably but the faults and defects of Go|vernment and Discipline.</P>
<P>As for the fitness of <HI>Ireland</HI> for Trade, we say as followeth.</P>
<P>1<HI>st.</HI> That <HI>Ireland</HI> consisting of above 18,000 square Miles; it is not one Place with another above 24 Miles from the Sea, because it is 750 Miles about. Wherefore forasmuch as the Land-carriage of Gross
<PB N="79" REF="48">
that will be easy in such a Country; it is fit for Trade, because the greatest and most pro|fitable part of Trade, and the Imployment of Shipping, depends upon such Goods, <HI>viz.</HI> Metals, Stones, Timber, Grain, Wood, Salt, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>2<HI>dly. Ireland</HI> lieth Commodiously for the Trade of the new <HI>American</HI> world; which we see every day to Grow and Flou|rish.</P>
<P>It lyeth well for sending Butter, Cheese, Beef, Fish, to their proper Markets, which are to the Southward, and the Plantations of <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>Thus is <HI>Ireland</HI> by Nature fit for Trade, but otherwise very much unprepared for the same; for as hath been often said, the Housing thereof consists of 160 M. nasty Cabbins, in which neither Butter nor Cheese, nor Linnen, Yarn nor Worsted, and I think no other, can be made to the best ad|vantage; chiefly by reason of the Soot and Smoaks annoying the same; as also for the Narrowness and Nastiness of the Place; which cannot be kept Clean nor Safe from Beasts and Vermin, nor from Damps and Musty Stenches, of which all the Eggs laid or kept in those Cabbins do partake. Where|fore to the advancement of Trade, the
<PB N="80" REF="49">
reformation of these Cabbins is necessa|ry.</P>
<P>It may also be consider'd, whether the Institution of these following Corporati|ons would not be expedient, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. of Cat|tel, 2. of Corn, 3. of Fish, 4. of Leather 5. of Wool, 6. of Linnen, 7. of Butter and Cheese, 8. of Metals and Minerals: For unto these, almost all the Commodities exportable out of <HI>Ireland,</HI> may be refer|red.</P>
<P>It may also be consider'd, whether the Taxing of those Cabbins with Hearth-mo|ney be proper, but rather with Days La|bour; the former being scarce possible for them to have, but the latter most easy. Insomuch as 'tis more easy for them to give 40 Days Labour <HI>per Ann.</HI> at seasonable times, than to pay 2 <HI>s.</HI> in Silver at a pinch, and just when the Collectors call for it.</P>
<P>The Dyet, Housing and Cloathing of the 16,000 Families abovementioned, is much the same as in <HI>England</HI>: Nor is the <HI>French</HI> Elegance unknown in many of them, nor the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Tongues. The latter whereof is very frequent among the poorest <HI>Irish,</HI> and chiefly in <HI>Kerry,</HI> most remote from <HI>Dublin.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="49">The Housing of 160 M. Families, is, as hath been often said, very wretched. But their Cloathing far better than that of the <HI>French</HI> Peasants, or the poor of most other Countreys; which advantage they have from their Wooll, whereof 12 Sheep fur|nisheth a competency to one of these Fa|milies. Which Wool, and the Cloth made of it, doth cost these poor people no less than 50 M. <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> for the dying it; a trade exercised by the Women of the Countrey. Madder, Allum, and Indico, are import<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, but the other dying Stuffs they find nearer home, a certain Mud taken out of the Bogs serving them for Copperas, the Rind of several Trees, and Saw-dust, for Galls; as for wild and green Weeds, they find enough, as also of Rhamnus-Berries.</P>
<P>The Diet of these people is Milk, sweet and sower, thick and thin, which also is their Drink in Summer-time, in Winter Small-Beer or Water. But Tobacco ta|ken in short Pipes seldom burnt, seems the pleasure of their Lives, together with Snee|zing: Insomuch, that 2/7 of their Expence in Food, is Tobacco. Their Food is Bread in Cakes, whereof a Penny serves a Week for each; Potatoes from <HI>August</HI> till <HI>May,</HI> Muscles, Cockles and Oysters, near the Sea;
<PB N="82" REF="50">
Eggs and Butter made very ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cid, by keep|ing in Bogs. As for Flesh, they seldom eat it, notwithstanding the great plenty there|of, unless it be of the smaller Animals, be|cause it is inconvenient for one of these Fa|milies to kill a Beef, which they have no convenience to save. So as 'tis easier for them to have a Hen or Rabbet, than a piece of Beef of equal substance.</P>
<P>Their Fewel is Turf in most places; and of late, even where Wood is most plentiful, and to be had for nothing, the cutting and carriage of the Turf being more easy than that of Wood. But to return from whence I disgressed, I may say, That the Trade of <HI>Ireland,</HI> among 12/22 parts of the whole peo|ple, is little or nothing, excepting for the Tobacco abovementioned, estimated worth about 50,000 l. for as much as they do not need any Forreign Commodities, nor scarce any thing made out of their own Village. Nor is above &frac13; part of their Expence other than what their own Family produceth, which Condition and state of living cannot beget Trade.</P>
<P>And now I shall digress again to consider, whether it were better for the Common|wealth to restrain the expence of 150 M. <HI>Optimates</HI> below 10 l. <HI>per Ann.</HI> each; or
<PB N="83" REF="50">
to beget a luxury in the 950 M. Plebeians, so as to make them spend, and consequently earn double to what they at present do.</P>
<P>To which I answer in brief, That the one shall encrease the sordidness and squal|lor of living already too visible in 950 M. Plebeians, with little benefit to the Com|mon Wealth; the other shall increase the splendor, Art and Industry of the 950 M. to the great enrichment of the Common|Wealth.</P>
<P>Again, Why should we be forbid the use of any Foreign Commodity, which our own Hands and Countrey cannot produce, when we can employ our spare Hands and Lands upon such exportable Commodities as will purchase the same, and more.</P>
<P N="3">3. The keeping or lessening of money, is not of that consequence that many guess it to be of. For in most places, especially <HI>Ireland,</HI> nay, <HI>England</HI> it self, the Money of the whole Nation is but about 1/16 of the Ex|pence of one Year; <HI>viz. Ireland</HI> is thought to have about 400 M.l. in Cash, and to spend about 4 Millions <HI>per Ann.</HI> Where|fore it is very ill-husbandry to double the Cash of the Nation, by destroying half its Wealth; Or to increase the Cash otherwise

than by increasing the Wealth <HI>simul &amp; semel.</HI></P>
<P>That is, when the Nation hath 1/10 more Cash, I require it should have 1/10 more Wealth, if it be possible. For, there may be as well too much money in a Country, as too little. I mean, as to the best advantage of its Trade; onely the Remedy is very easy, it may be soon turn'd into the magnificence of Gold and Silver Vessels.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> Many think that <HI>Ireland</HI> is much impoverished, or at least the money there|of much exhausted, by reason of Absentees, who are such as having Lands in <HI>Ireland,</HI> do live out of the Kingdom, and do therefore think it just that such, according to former Statutes, should lose their said Estates.</P>
<P>Which Opinion I oppose, as both unjust, inconvenient, and frivolous. For 1st. If a man carry Money or other Effects out of <HI>England</HI> to purchase Lands in <HI>Ireland,</HI> why should not the Rents, Issues and Profits of the same Land return into <HI>England,</HI> with the same Reason that the Money of <HI>Eng|land</HI> was diminished to buy it?</P>
<P N="2">2. I suppose &frac14; of the Land of <HI>Ireland</HI> did belong to the Inhabitants of <HI>England,</HI> and that the same lay all in one place toge|ther; why may not the said quarter of the
<PB N="85" REF="51">
whole Land be cut off from the other three sent into <HI>England,</HI> were it possible so to do? and if so, why may not the Rents of the same be actually sent, without prejudice to the other three parts of the Interessors thereof?</P>
<P N="3">3. If all men were bound to spend the Proceed of their Lands upon the Land it self; then as all the Proceed of <HI>Ireland,</HI> ought to be spent in <HI>Ireland</HI>; so all the Proceed of one County of <HI>Ireland,</HI> ought to be spent in the same; of one Barony, in the same Barony; and so Parish and Mannor; and at length it would follow, that every eater ought to avoid what he hath eaten upon the same Turf where the same grew. Moreover, this equal spreading of Wealth would de|stroy all Splendor and Ornament; for if it were not fit that one place should be more splendid than another, so also that no one man should be greater or richer than ano|ther; for if so, then the Wealth, suppose of <HI>Ireland,</HI> being perhaps 11 Millions, being divided among 1,100 M. people, then no one man having above 101. he could Proba|bly build no House worth above 31. which would be to leave the face of Beggery upon the whole Nation: And withal such Parity would beget Anarchy and Confusion.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="52">Of the other Impediment of Trade, the not raising of Money above the value which the generality of the whole World hath of it, that is, the intrinsick value, I have spo|ken before: And now return to other mat|ters relating to the Trade of <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>Having shewn that there is little or no Trade or Commutation of Commodities, where people live so simply, and as it were <HI>exsponte creatis</HI>; as the Inhabitants of 184 M. do live; It follows, that what Trade is in <HI>Ireland</HI> must be found in the 16,000 other Houses of above one Chimney in each, and amongst the Inhabitants of them. Though Trade, properly speaking, be the Commutation of Commodities; that generally speaking, 'tis the way whereby to purchase Riches and Power, the Parents of Pleasure: Not only by getting Com|modities out of the Earth and Sea; by ploughing, fishing, Mines, Vecture, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by getting away those Commodities from them, who first got them out of the Earth and Sea, as aforesaid. And not only, or at all encreasing the whole Wealth of the Na|tion, but ones own former share and pro|portion of the whole, though diminish'd; that is to say, Supposing the whole Wealth of <HI>Ireland</HI> were 10 Millions, and the Share
<PB N="87" REF="52">
of A. was 1000 1. thereof; I say, 'tis commonly more the care of A. to make his 1000 l. 3000, though by lessening the whole Stock 2000 l. than to make the whole Stock 30 Millions, by lessening his own 1000 l. to 300.l.</P>
<P>Now this is the Trade of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and I think of most other places, but exercised in <HI>Ireland</HI> by the following ways, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Whereas the Lands of <HI>Ireland</HI> have with|in 150 years been most of them forfeited, and the Lands of Monasteries have since then fallen into the King's hands, by the dis|solution of the said Monasteries, and several Defects found in the Titles, older than that of time; It hath come to pass, that all the said Lands have been granted to several o|thers; some legally and formally, some o|therwise; some under one Condition, some under another. So as by several Defects in the said Grants, or by non-perfor|mance of Conditions, and many other ways needless to enumerate, the King in strictness may find a Title to the Estates of many men who have been long in possession of their respective Hold|ings, (tho some more, some less, some upon better, and some upon worser grounds.) A principal Trade in <HI>Ireland,</HI> to find out these
<PB N="88" REF="53">
Flaws and Defects, to procure Commission for such Inquiries. And a Branch of this Trade, is to give to such seekers flattering and delusive Informations to bring on other Designs; and withal, prevail with persons conversant with the Higher Powers, to give Grants of these Discoveries, and thereupon, right or wrong to vex the Possessors, at least into such a Composition, as may be of pro|fit to the Prosecutors. Whereby it falls out, that the time of all the persons exercised <HI>pro &amp; contra</HI> in these matters, who do only take from one another like Gamesters (the Lawyers taking from both) is lost, without advancing at all the Publick Wealth. Now this is no Trade, but a Calamity upon the Nation.</P>
<P N="2">2. Whereas the Branches of the Publick Revenue being manifold; and the Accompts of the same vast and numerous, and the Laws, with the Cases and Accidents rela|ting to the same, intricate and new; but chiefly the Officers employed about the Pre|mises, such as could make Friends for their Places, whether Persons of Skill, Experi|ence and Trustiness, or not; It hath come to pass, even in <HI>Ireland,</HI> in former times, that Principal Officers of the Exchequer have represented the State of the Publick
<PB N="89" REF="53">
Treasury near 200 M. l. differently from each other: So as new men have been admitted to take the whole to farm, who expected vast Advantages, by mending and clearing what others had marr'd and confounded, though they had still their Places and Perquisites not|withstanding: And in this case the people thought fit to pay any thing that was requi|red, rather than to pass the Fire of this Purga|tory, even tho they need no burning.</P>
<P>This and other Practices of Farming, ta|ken with the whole Doctrine of Defalcati|ons, hath been a great Trade in <HI>Ireland,</HI> but a Calamity on the people who have paid great Wages to them that have made Faults, but three times greater to those who would but undertake to mend them, tho indeed they could not.</P>
<P>A Third great Trade and Calamity to the people of <HI>Ireland,</HI> hath been the Gains made by the aforementioned. Difference, Confusion, and badness of Coins, exorbi|tant Exchange, and Interest of Money, all following also from the Premises.</P>
<P>A Fourth Calamity is implicating poor Work-men, and trapanning them into Crimes, Indictments, Bishops-Courts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> feigning and compounding of Trespasses, not without making benefit by the Office of Justice of Peace.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="54">A Fifth may be from the manner of mak|ing Sheriffs, the execution of their Offices, Accompts in the Exchequer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>A Sixth, from raising Moneys at the As|sizes, by Authority of the Grand Juries, but raising too much, and in spending or not spending what was to be raised.</P>
<P>None of these Six Trades do add any more to the Common-wealth than Game|sters, and even such of them as play with false Dice, do to the Common-Stock of the whole Number.</P>
<P>And in these Trades 'tis thought &frac23; of those who inhabit the aforementioned 16,000 Houses, do exercise themselves, and are the Locusts and Catterpillars of the Common|wealth, as the Inhabitants of the other 184 M. Cottages are the untilled part of the same. Wherefore it remains to see what Trade is to be found among the rest; which I take to be as followeth, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. In Domestick Wealth: Of which sort is building fine Houses and Gardens, Orchards, Groves, Inns, Mills, Churches, Bridges, HighWays, Causeys; as also Fur|niture for Houses, Coaches, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In which kind I guess the Improvement of <HI>Ireland</HI> has since the Year 1652. 1673. advanc'd
<PB N="90" REF="54">
from one to four, and I think to a better state than before 1641. that is, than per|haps ever it yet was.</P>
<P>The Foreign Trade, if you will believe the Accompts of Customs, <HI>Ann.</HI> 1657. and now, hath been advanced from one to seven, but in reality, I think, from one to two: For the Customs yielded <HI>Ann.</HI> 1656. clear under 12,000 <HI>l.</HI> but were with|in a year or two, let for above three times the sum, but are now at about 80,000 in|trinsecally.</P>
<P>But to speak more clearly and Authenti|cally upon this Subject, I shall insert the following Tables of exported and imported Commodities, and from them make the sub|nexed Observations, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>The TABLES.</HEAD>

<ITEM>1. THAT the Customs, managed by the States-Officers, yielded <HI>An|no</HI> 1657. under 12,000 <HI>l.</HI> but was farm'd <HI>Ann.</HI> 1658. for above thrice that Sum.</ITEM>

<ITEM>4. That the Manufacture bestowed up|on a years Exportation out of <HI>Ireland,</HI> is not worth above 8000 <HI>l.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. That because more eatables were exported <HI>Anno</HI> 1664. than 1641. And more Manufactures 1641. than <HI>Ann.</HI> 1664. It follows, there were more people in <HI>Ire|land, Ann.</HI> 1641. than 1664. and in that proportion as was formerly mention'd.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. That the Exportations appear more worth than the Importations, excepting that the Accompts of the former are more true, but of the latter very conjectural, and probably less than the Truth.</ITEM>

<HEAD>Of the Religion, Diet, Cloaths, Language, Manners, and Interest of the several pre|sent Inhabitants of <HI>IRELAND.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE said, that of the 1100 M. Inhabi|tants of <HI>Ireland,</HI> about 800 M. of them were <HI>Irish</HI>; and that above 600 M. of them lived very simply in the Cabbins aforemention'd. Wherefore I shall in the first place describe the Religion, Diet, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of these, being the major part of the whole; not wholly omitting some of the other spe|cies also.</P>
<P>The Religion of these poorer <HI>Irish,</HI> is called <HI>Roman Catholick,</HI> whose Head is the Pope of <HI>Rome,</HI> from whence they are pro|perly enough called <HI>Papists.</HI> This Religi|on is well known in the World, both by the Books of their Divines, and the Wor|ship in their Churches: wherefore I con|fine my self to what I think peculiar to these <HI>Irish.</HI> And first, I observe, that the Priests among them are of small Learning; but are thought by their Flocks to have much, because they can speak Latin more or less; and can often out-talk in Latin those who Dispute with them. So as they are
<PB N="95" REF="56">
thereby thought both more Orthodox and Able than their Antagonists.</P>
<P>Their Reading in Latin is the Lives of the Saints, and Fabulous Stories of their Country. But the Superior Learning a|mong them, is the Philosophy of the Schools, and the Genealogies of their Ancestors. Both which look like what St. <HI>Paul</HI> hath Condemned.</P>
<P>The Priests are chosen for the most part out of old <HI>Irish</HI> Gentry; and thereby influ|ence the People, as well by their Interest as their Office.</P>
<P>Their Preaching seems rather Bugbear|ing of their flocks with dreadful Stories, than persuading them by Reason, or the Scriptures. They have an incredible Opi|nion of the Pope and his Sanctity, of the happiness of those who can obtain his Bles|sing at the third or fourth hand. Only some few, who have lately been abroad, have gotten so far, as to talk of a difference between the Interest of the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> and the Doctrine of the Church. The Common Priests have few of them been out of <HI>Ireland</HI>; and those who have, were bred in Covents, or made Friars for the most part, and have humble Opinions of the <HI>English</HI> and Protestants, and of the mis|chiefs
<PB N="94" REF="56">
of setting up Manufactures, and in|troducing of Trade. They also comfort their Flocks, partly by Prophecies of their Restoration to their Ancient Estates and Li|berties, which the abler sort of them fetch from what the Prophets of the Old-Testa|ment have delivered by way of God's Pro|mise to restore the <HI>Iews,</HI> and the Kingdom to <HI>Israel.</HI> They make little esteem of an Oath upon a Protestant Bible, but will more de|voutly take up a Stone, and swear upon it, calling it a Book, than by the said Book of Books, the Bible. But of all Oaths, they think themselves at much liberty to take a Land-Oath, as they call it: Which is an Oath to prove a forg'd Deed, a Possession, Livery or Seisin, payment of Rents, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in order to recover for their Countrey-men the Lands which they had forfeited. They have a great Opinion of Holy-Wells, Rocks, and Caves, which have been the reputed Cells and Receptacles of men reputed Saints, They do not much fear Death, if it be upon a Tree, unto which, or the Gallows, they will go upon their Knees toward it, from the place they can first see it. They con|fess nothing at their Executions, though ne|ver so guilty. In brief, there is much Su|perstition among them, but formerly much
<PB N="46" REF="57">
more than is now; for as much as by the Conversation of Protestants, they become asham'd of their ridiculous Practices, which are not <HI>de side.</HI> As for the Richer and better|educated sort of them, they are such Catho|licks as are in other places. The Poor, in adhering to their Religion, which is rather a Custom than a Dogma amongst them, They seem rather to obey their Grandees, old Landlords, and the Heads of their Septes and Clans, than God. For when these were under Clouds, transported into <HI>Spain,</HI> and transplanted into <HI>Connaught,</HI> and disa|bled to serve them as formerly, about the year 1656. when the Adventurers and Sol|diers appeared to be their Landlords and Patrons, they were observ'd to have been forward enough to relax the stiffness of their pertinacity to the Pope, and his Impositions. <HI>Lastly,</HI> Among the better sort of them, ma|ny think less of the Pope's Power in Tem|porals, as they call it, than formerly; and begin to say, that the Supremacy, even in Spirituals, lies rather in the Church diffu|sive, and in qualified General-Councils, than in the Pope al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne, or than in the Pope and his Cardinals, or other <HI>Iuncto.</HI></P>
<P>The Religion of the Protestants in <HI>Ire|land,</HI> is the same with the Church of <HI>Eng|land</HI>
<PB N="97" REF="57">
in Doctrine, only they differ in Disci|pline thus, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>The Legal Protestants hold the Power of the Church to be in the King, and that Bishops and Arch-Bishops, with their Clerks, are the best way of adjusting that Power under him. The Presbyterians would have the same thing done, and per|haps more, by Classes of Presbyters Nati|onal and Provincial. The Independents would have all Christian Congregations independent from each other. The <HI>Ana|baptists</HI> are Independent in Discipline, and differ from all those aforemention'd in the Baptism of Infants, and in the inward and spiritual Signification of that Ordinance. The Quakers salute not by uncovering the Head, speak to one another in the se|cond Person, and singular Number; as for Magistracy and Arms, they seem to hold with the <HI>Anabaptists</HI> of <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Hol|land</HI>; they pretend to a possibility of per|fection, like the Papists; as for other Te|nents, 'tis hard to fix them, or to under|stand what things they mean by their Words.</P>
<P>The Diet of the poorer <HI>Irish,</HI> is what was before discoursed in the Chap|ter.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="58">The Cloathing is a narrow sort of Frieze, of about twenty Inches broad, whereof two foot, call'd a Bandle, is worth from 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to 18 <HI>d.</HI> Of this, Seventeen Bandles make a Man's Suit, and twelve make a Cloak. According to which Measures and Proportions, and the number of People who wear this Stuff, it seems, that near thrice as much Wooll is spent in <HI>Ireland,</HI> as exported; whereas others have thought quite contrary, that is, that the exported Wooll is triple in quantity to what is spent at home.</P>
<P>As for the Manners of the <HI>Irish,</HI> I de|duce them from their Original Constituti|ons of Body, and from the Air; next from their ordinary Food; next from their Condition of Estate and Liberty, and from the Influence of their Governours and Teachers; and lastly, from their Ancient Customs, which affect as well their Con|scien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es as their Nature. For their Shape, Stature, Colour, and Complexion, I see nothing in them inferior to any other Peo|ple, nor any enormous predominancy of any humour.</P>
<P>Their Lazing seems to me to proceed rather from want of Imployment and En|couragement to Work, than from the na|tural
<PB N="99" REF="58">
abundance of Flegm in their Bowels and Blood; for what need they to Work, who can content themselv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s with <HI>Potato's,</HI> whereof the Labour of one Man can feed for|ty; and with Milk, whereof one Cow will, in Summer time, give meat and drink enough for three Men, when they can every where gather Cockles, Oysters, Muscles, Crabs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with Boats, Nets, Angles, or the Art of Fishing; can build an House in three days? And why should they desire to fare better, tho with more Labo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r, when they are taught, that this way of living is more like the Patriarchs of old, and the Saints of later times, by whose Prayers and Merits they are to be reliev'd, and whose Examples they are therefore to follow? And why should they breed more Cattel, since 'tis Penal to import them into <HI>England</HI>? Why should they raise more Commodities, since there are not Merchants sufficiently Stock'd to take them of them, nor provided with other more pleasing foreign Com|modities, to give in Exchange for them? And how should Merchants have Stock, since Trade is prohibited and fetter'd by the Statutes of <HI>England</HI>? And why should Men endeavour to get Estates, where the Legislative Power is not agreed upon; and
<PB N="100" REF="59">
where Tricks and Words destroy natural Right and Property?</P>
<P>They are accused also of much Treache|ry, Falseness, and Thievery; none of all which, I conceive, is natural to them; for as to Treachery, they are made believe, that they all shall flourish again, after some time; wherefore they will not really sub|mit to those whom they hope to have their Servants; nor will they declare so much, but say the contrary, for their present ease, which is all the Treachery I have obser|ved; for they have in their hearts, not on|ly a grudging to see their old Proprieties enjoyed by Foreigners, but a persuasion they shall be shortly restor'd. As for Thievery, it is affixt to all thin-peopled Countries, such as <HI>Ireland</HI> is, where there cannot be many Eyes to prevent such Crimes; and where what is stolen, is ea|sily hidden and eaten, and where 'tis easy to burn the House, or violate the Persons of those who prosecute these Crimes, and where thin-peopled Countries are govern'd by the Laws that were made and first fit|ted to thick-peopled Countries; and where matter of small moment and value must be try'd, with all the formalities which belong to the highest Causes. In this case there
<PB N="101" REF="59">
must be thieving, where is withal, neither encouragement, nor method, nor means for Labouring, nor Provision for Impo|tents.</P>
<P>As for the Interest of these poorer <HI>Irish,</HI> it is manifestly to be transmuted into <HI>Eng|lish,</HI> so to reform and qualify their housing, as that <HI>English</HI> Women may be content to be their Wives, to decline their Language, which continues a sensible distinction, be|ing not now necessary; which makes those who do not understand it, suspect, that what is spoken in it, is to their prejudice. It is their Interest to deal with the <HI>English,</HI> for Leases, for Time, and upon clear Conditions, which being perform'd they are absolute Freemen, rather than to stand always liable to the humour and caprice of their Landlords, and to have every thing taken from them, which he pleases to fan|cy. It is their Interest, that he is well|pleased with their Obedience to them, when they see and know upon whose Care and Conduct their well-being depends, who have Power over their Lands and Estates. Then, to believe a Man at <HI>Rome</HI> has Power in all these last mentioned Par|ticulars in this World, and can make them eternally happy or miserable hereafter, 'tis
<PB N="102" REF="60">
their Interest to joyn with them, and fol|low their Example, who have brought Arts, Civility, and Freedom into their Country.</P>
<P>On the contrary, What did they ever get by accompanying their Lords into Rebellion against the <HI>English</HI>? What should they have gotten if the late Rebellion had abso|lutely succeeded, but a more absolute Ser|vitude? And when it fail'd, these poor People have lost all their Estates, and their Leaders encreas'd theirs, and enjoy'd the very Land which their Leaders caus'd them to lose. The poorest now in <HI>Ireland</HI> ride on Horse-back, when heretofore the best ran on foot like Animals. They wear better loaths than ever; the Gentry have better Breeding, and the generality of the <HI>Plebeians</HI> more Money and Free|dom.</P>

<HEAD>Several Miscellany Remarks and Intimations, concerning <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the several Mat|ters aforementioned.</HEAD>
<P>WIthout recourse to the Authority of Story, but rather diligently ob|serving the Law and Course of Nature, I conjecture, that whatever is fabled of the <HI>Phoenicians, Scythians, B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">scayers, &amp;c.</HI> their first Inhabiting of <HI>Ireland</HI>; that the places near <HI>Carrickfergus</HI> were first peopled, and that with those, who came from the parts of <HI>Scotland</HI> opposite thereunto. For that <HI>Ireland</HI> was planted by some body in <HI>Caesar</HI>'s time, is most certain. That the Art of Navigation was not before <HI>Caesar</HI>'s time so well understood and practis'd, as to bring Men from any other Part of the World thither, save from <HI>Great Britain</HI>: That from St. <HI>Davids-head</HI> in <HI>South-Wales,</HI> and from <HI>Holy-head</HI> in <HI>North-Wales</HI>; <HI>Ireland</HI> is not clearly at any time discern'd, nor often at all. That the Inhabitants of those two <HI>Brittish</HI> Head-lands had neither Boats sit to pass that Sea, is most probable. But that <HI>Carrickfergus</HI> may be always seen from <HI>Scotland,</HI> is well known; and that a small
<PB N="104" REF="61">
Boat may Row over in three or four hours, is experienc'd. That the Language of those Parts differ very little. That the Country about <HI>Carrickfergus</HI> is far better than that of <HI>Scotland</HI> opposite. That the chief Bishops Seat of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and proba|bly the first, is near those Parts, are all no|torious Truths. From all which 'tis more probable, that <HI>Ireland</HI> was first Peopled from <HI>Scotland,</HI> than all the other remote Parts aforementioned.</P>
<P>It hath been much observed, That the Lieutenants and Chancellors of <HI>Ireland</HI> have often been at variance; the reason whereof seems to be at their Powers, and too near an <HI>Equilibrium</HI>; for the Lieute|nant Commands an Army perhaps of 3000, and the Chancellor makes 900 Ju|stices of Peace, who make 2500 Consta|bles, which are the Civil Sword, who Act in times of Peace, and every where, and in all matters; whereas the Army acts only upon rare occasions, and are more Mercenary Men. So as the Civil-Sword seems of far more extent and effect than the Military-Sword.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant disposes perhaps of four or five hundred Places and Imployments; but the Chancellor, of the said nine hundred
<PB N="105" REF="61">
Justices of Peace, and several others. The Lieutenant can hurt very few Persons, who do not depend upon the favour of Imploy|ments; but the Chancellor can affect all Men, of Estates and Dealing in the World, by the Power of his Court, and by the Harmony of his own Will with the King's Conscience.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant is for the most part a Stranger to <HI>Ireland</HI>; but the Chancellor sel|dom such, but a Person of great Family and Acquaintance. Moreover, all the Lieutenants, Deputies, and Lords Justices, that have been these 150 years, have not, one with another, continued two years in the Office; but the Chancellors have much more, and are seldom remov'd but by Death, and General Revolutions. The Chancellor has ordinarily some other Dig|nity and Office annex'd, for they be of|ten Eminent Prelates and Church-men; but the Lieutenant is confin'd to Tempo|rals. The Chancellor is Speaker in Par|liament, and by keeping the Seal, can check the Lieutenant in many cases. The Chancellors are bred to Eloquence and Arguing; the breeding of a Lieutenant is casual.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="62">Men that bring great Estates into <HI>Ire|land,</HI> do not encrease them proportionably with them who come over with nothing. Not to quote the Examples hereof on both sides, the reason seems not to be very ab|struse, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>The Language of <HI>Ireland</HI> is like that of the <HI>North</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in many things like the <HI>Welch</HI> and <HI>Manques</HI>; but in <HI>Ireland</HI> the <HI>Fingallians</HI> speak neither <HI>English, Irish,</HI> nor <HI>Welch</HI>; and the People about <HI>Wexford,</HI> tho they agree in a Language differing from <HI>English, Welch,</HI> and <HI>Irish,</HI> yet 'tis not the same with that of the <HI>Fingalians</HI> near <HI>Dub|lin.</HI> Both these two sorts of People are honest and laborious Members of the <HI>King|dom.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Irish</HI> Language, and the <HI>Welch,</HI> as also all Languages that have not been the Languages of flourishing Empires, where|in were many Things, many Notions and Fancies, both Poetical and Philosophical, hath but few words; and all the names of Artificial things brought into use, since the Empire of these Linguists ceased, are ex|pressed in the language of their Conquerors, by altering the Termination and Accents only.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="62"><HI>Ireland</HI> is now divided into Provinces, Counties, Baronies, Parishes, and Farm|lands, and those, so as that they may be, and have been Geometrically delineated; but formerly it was not so, but the Country was cal'ed by the names of the Lords who governed the People. For as a Territory bounded by Bogs, is greater or lesser as the Bog is more dry and passible, or otherwise: So the Country of a Grandee or Tierne in <HI>Ireland,</HI> became greater or lesser as his For|ces waxed or weaned; for where was a large Castle and Garison, there the Juris|diction was also large.</P>
<P>And when these Grandees came to make peace, and parts one with another, the li|mits of their Land-agreements were no lines Geometrically drawn; but if the Rain fell one way, then the Land whereon it fell, did belong to A. if the other way, to B. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Considerations relating to the Improvement of IRELAND.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE whole Territory of <HI>Ireland</HI> con|sists of about 12 Millions of Acres (<HI>English</HI> Measure) of Arrable, Meadow, and good Pasture Land; with about two Millions of Rocky, Boggy, and Scrubby Pasture, commonly call'd Unprofitable, (tho not altogether such): The rest being absolute Boggs, Loughs, Rocks, Sands, Strands, Rivers and High-ways, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Of all which, several Lands, the yearly Rent (comprehending Their Majesties Quit-Rents, Tythes and Tenants Improvements) is sup|posed to be about 9<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">0,000 <HI>l.</HI> and worth to be purchased at Nine Millions.</P>
<P N="2">2. The value of all the Housing in <HI>Ireland,</HI> which have one or more Chimneys in them, (excluding all Cabbins which have none) is supposed to be Two Millions and a half.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="116" REF="67">3. The Cattel and Live-Stock, Three Millions.</P>
<P N="4">4. Corn, Furniture, Merchandise, Ship|ping, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> about One Million.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Coyned and Currant Money, now running in Trade, is between 300, and 350,<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">00 <HI>l.</HI> or the 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th part of the value of the whole Kingdom, which we suppose to be about 16 Millions.</P>
<P N="6">6. The number of people in <HI>Ireland</HI> is a|bout 1100,000, <HI>viz.</HI> Three Hundred Thou|sand <HI>English, Scotch,</HI> and <HI>Welch Protestants,</HI> and 800,000 <HI>Papists,</HI> whereof <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th are Children unfit for Labour, and about 75,000 of the Remainder are, by rea|son of their Quality and Estates; above the necessity of Corporal Labour; so as there remains 750,000 Labouring Men and Wo|men, 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">0,000 whereof do perform the pre|sent Work of the Nation.</P>
<P N="7">7. The said 1100,000 people do live in about 200,000 Families or Houses, where|of there are but about 16,000 which have more than one Chimney in each; and about 24,000 which have but one; all the other Houses, being 160,000, are wretched na|sty Cabbins, without Chimney, Window or Door shut, and worse than those of the Savage <HI>Americans,</HI> and wholly unfit for the
<PB N="117" REF="67">
making Merchantable Butter, Cheese, or the Manufactures of Woollen, Linnen or Leather.</P>
<P N="8">8. The Houses within the City and Li|berties of <HI>Dublin,</HI> are under 5,0<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">0, <HI>viz.</HI> in the City 1150. And the Ale-Houses within the same about 1200. And it seems, that in other Corporations and Countrey Towns, the proportion of Ale-Houses is yet grea|ter than in <HI>Dublin, viz.</HI> about &frac13; of the whole.</P>
<P N="9">9. The Counties, Baronies and Parishes, of <HI>Ireland,</HI> are now become marvellously un|equal, so as some are twe ty times as big as others, the County of <HI>C rk</HI> seeming in re|spect of people and Parishes to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th of the whole Kingdom, and other Counties not being above the 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th part of the County of <HI>Cork</HI>; It hath been found very difficult to get fit persons for Sheriffs, and Juries; and the often holding of Assizes and Quarter-Sessions in the said smaller Counties, hath been found an unnecessary burthen upon them.</P>
<P N="10">10. There are now in <HI>Ireland</HI> 32 Coun|ties, 252 Baronies, and 2278 Parishes; so as the number of Sheriffs, and Sub-Sheriffs, Sheriff Bailiffs, High and Petty-Constables, are about three thousand Persons, whereof
<PB N="118" REF="68">
not above <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> are <HI>English</HI> or <HI>Protestants.</HI> So as the remainder (being about 27<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">0) are <HI>Irish Papists,</HI> and are the Civil Militia of this Kingdom, and have the executing of all Decrees of Courts, and of Justices of the Peaces Warrants.</P>
<P N="11">11. This Civil Militia, and the rest of the <HI>Irish Papists</HI> being 'about 80<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,000, are influenced and guided by about 3000 Priests and Fryars, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they governed by their Bi|shops and Superiors, who are for the most part, of the Old <HI>Irish</HI> Gentry, men of Foreign Education, and who depend upon Foreign Princes and Prelates, for Benefices and Preferments.</P>
<P N="12">12. The <HI>Irish Papists</HI> (beside<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Sundays and the 29 Holidays appointed by the Law) do one place with another, observe about 24 days more in the year, in which they do no Corporal Labour, so as they have but about 266 Working-days; whereas Protestants not strictly observing all the Legal Holy-days, by a total forbearing of Labour, have in effect 300 Working-days in the year, that is, 34 days more than the Papists, or at least five of six days in each, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> part of the whole year.</P>
<P N="13">13. The expence of the whole people of <HI>Ireland</HI> is about four Millions <HI>per Ann.</HI>
<PB N="119" REF="68">
the &frac13; part whereof being 80,000 <HI>l.</HI> and the Quarter of Annual House-Rent being about 6<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,000 <HI>l.</HI> together with 450,<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">00 <HI>l.</HI> more, being the value of half a years Rent, Tythes and Quit-Rent, do make 59<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,000 l. as that sum of Money which will compleatly and plentifully drive the Trade of this King|dom.</P>
<P N="14">14. The value of the Commodities ex|ported out of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the Fraight of the Shipping imployed in the Trade of this Nation, together with the fishing of <HI>Her|rings,</HI> is about Five Hundred Thousand pounds <HI>per Annum.</HI></P>
<P N="15">15.

<P N="16">16. The value of the Cattel, <HI>viz.</HI> live Oxen and Sheep, carried out of <HI>Ireland</HI> into
<PB N="120" REF="69">
<HI>England,</HI> was never more than 140,000 l. <HI>per Annum</HI>; the Fraight, Hides, Tallow, and Wooll of the said live Cattel, were worth about 60,000 l. of the said 140,000 l. And the value of the Goods imported out of <HI>England</HI> into <HI>Ireland</HI> (when the Cattel-Trade was free) was between Treble and Quadruple, to the neat value of the Ox, and She<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ps Fle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h transported from hence into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P N="17">17. The Customs of Exported and Im|ported Goods, between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ire|land,</HI> abstracted from the Excise thereof, was in the freest Trade, about 32,000 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>Inferences from the Premisses.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. BY comparing the Extent of the Ter|ritory with the number of people, it appears that <HI>Ireland</HI> is much underpeopled; for as much as there are above 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Acres of good Land to every Head in <HI>Ireland,</HI> where|as in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France</HI> there are but four, and in <HI>Holland</HI> scarce one.</P>
<P N="2">2. That if there be 250 000 spare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ands capable of Labour, who can earn 4 or five l.
<PB N="121" REF="69">
<HI>per Ann.</HI> one with another, it follows that the people of <HI>Ireland,</HI> well employed, may earn one Million <HI>per Ann.</HI> more than they do now, which is more than the years Rent of the whole Country.</P>
<P N="3">3. If an House with Stone-Walls, and a Chimney well covered, and half an A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re of Land well ditched about, may be made for 4 or 5 <HI>l.</HI> or thereabouts; then &frac13; of the spare hands of <HI>Ireland</HI> can in one years time build and fit up 160,000 such Houses and Gardens, instead of the like number of the wretched Cabbins above-mentioned: And that in a time when a Foreign-Trade is most dead and obstructed, and when Mo|ney is most scarce in the Land.</P>
<P N="4">4. The other third part of the said spare hands within the same year (besides the making of Bridges, Harbors, Rivers, High-ways, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> more fit for Trade) are able to plant as many Fruit and Timber-Trees, and also Quick-set Hedges, as being grown up, would distinguish the Bounds of Lands, beautifie the Countrey, shade and shelter Cattel, furnish Wood, Fuel, Timber and fruit, in a better manner than ever was yet known in <HI>Ireland</HI> or <HI>England.</HI> And all this in a time when Trade is dead, and Money most scarce.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="122" REF="70">5. If the Gardens belonging to the Cab|bins above mentioned, be planted with Hemp and Flax, according to the present Statute, there would grow 120,000 <HI>l.</HI> worth of the said Commodities, the Manufactures whereof, as also of the Wooll and Hides now exported, would by the labour of the spare hands above-mentioned, amount to above One Million <HI>per Annum</HI> more than at present.</P>
<P N="6">6. The multitude and proportion of Alehouses above-mentioned, is a sign of want of Employment in those that buy, no less than those that sell the Drink.</P>
<P N="7">7. There being but 800 Thousand Papists in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and little above 2,000 Priests; It is manifest that 500 Priests may, in a competent manner, Officiate for the said number of People and Parishes. And that two Popish Bishops if any at all be ne|cessary) may as well Govern the said 500 Priests, and two Thousand Parishes; as the 26 Bishops of <HI>England</HI> do Govern near Ten Thousand Parishes.</P>
<P N="8">8. If the Protestants, according to the present practice and understanding of the Law, do work one tenth part of the Year more than the Papists: And that there be be 750 Thousand working People in <HI>Ire|land,</HI>
<PB N="123" REF="70">
whereof about 600 Thousand Papists. It follows that the Popish Religion takes off 60 Thousand workers, which, at about 4 <HI>l. per Annum</HI> each, is about 250 Thousand Pounds <HI>per Annum</HI> of it self; besides the Maintenance of 25 Hundred superfluous Churchmen, which at 20 <HI>l. per Annum</HI> each, comes to fifty thousand pounds <HI>per Annum</HI> more.</P>
<P N="9">9. The Sheriffs of <HI>Ireland</HI> at 100 <HI>l. per Annum,</HI> the High Constables at 20 <HI>l. per Annum,</HI> and the Petty Constables at 10 <HI>l. per Annum,</HI> each, being all <HI>English</HI> Pro|testants (with some other incident Charges for the Administration of Justice) may be fallarated and defrayed for thirty thousand Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> consistent with His Ma|jesty's present Revenue, Forces, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which said Sallaries, may also be lessened, by Uni|ting some of the smaller Countie's, Baro|nies and Parishes, according to the propor|tion of People Inhabiting within them.</P>
<P N="10">10. If there be not 350 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">housand Pounds Coyned Money in <HI>Ireland</HI>; And if 590 Thousand Pounds (or near double what there now is) be requisite to drive the Trade thereof; then it follows, that there is not enough in <HI>Ireland</HI> to drive the Trade of the Nation.</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="124" REF="71">11. If the Lands of <HI>Ireland</HI> and Housing in Corporations, be worth above 10 Milli|ons to be now sold (and if less than One Million of stock will drive all the Trade afore-mentioned, that <HI>Ireland</HI> is capable off) reckoning but two returns <HI>per Annum</HI>: It is certain that the lesser part of the said Ten Millions worth of real Estate, being well contrived into a Bank of Credit, will with the Cash yet remaining, abundantly an|swer all the ends of Domestick Improve|ments, and Foreign Traffick whatsoever.</P>
<P N="12">12. If the whole substance of <HI>Ireland</HI> be worth 16 Millions, as above said: If the customs between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> were neverworth above thirty two thousand Pounds <HI>per Annum:</HI> I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Titles of Estates in <HI>Ireland,</HI> be more hazardous and expen|sive, for that <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> be not under one Legislative Power: If <HI>Ireland</HI> till now, hath been a continual Charge to <HI>England</HI>: If the reducing the late Rebelli|on did cost <HI>England</HI> three times more in men and money, than the substance of the whole Countrey, when reduced, is worth: If it be just, that men of <HI>English</HI> B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rth and Estates, living in <HI>Ireland,</HI> should be repre|sented in the Legislative Power; and that the <HI>Irish</HI> should not be judged by those who,
<PB N="125" REF="71">
they pretend, do usurp their Estates: It then seems just and convenient, That both Kingdoms should be United and Governed by one Legislative Power. Nor is it hard to shew how this may be made practicable, nor to satisfy, repair, or silence those who are Interested or Affected to the contrary.</P>
<P N="13">13. In the mean time, it is wonderful that men born in <HI>England,</HI> who have Lands granted to them by the King, for service done in <HI>Ireland</HI> to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> when they have occasion to reside or ne|gotiate in <HI>England,</HI> should by their Country|men, Kindred and Friends there, be debar|red to bring with them out of <HI>Ireland</HI> food whereupon to live, nor suffered to carry money out of <HI>Ireland,</HI> nor to bring such Commodities as they fetch from <HI>Ame|rica</HI> directly home, but round about by <HI>En|gland,</HI> with extream hazard and loss, and be forced to trade only with Strangers, and become unacquainted with their own Coun|try; especially when <HI>England</HI> gaineth more than it loseth by a free Commerce; as expor|ting hither three times as much as it recei|veth from hence: In so much as 95 <HI>l.</HI> in <HI>En|gland,</HI> was worth about 100 <HI>l.</HI> of the like Money in <HI>Ireland,</HI> in the freest time of Trade.</P>
<P N="14"><PB N="126" REF="72">14. It is conceived that about &frac13;<HI>d</HI> of the Imported Manufactures, might be made in <HI>Ireland</HI> and &frac13;<HI>d</HI> of the remainder might be more conveniently had from Foreign parts, than out of <HI>England,</HI> and consequently that it is scarce necessary at all for <HI>Ireland</HI> to re|ceive any goods of <HI>England,</HI> and not conve|nient to receive above <HI>th</HI> part from hence of the whole which it needeth to Import, the value whereof is under 100 Thousand Pounds <HI>per Annum.</HI></P>

<P>Propositions to be consider'd of by his Majesty, concerning the gover|ning of <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SIGNED>CHARLES <HI>R.</HI></SIGNED></OPENER>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THAT his Majesty may declare his express Pleasure, that no</HI> Irish <HI>Suit by way of reward be moved for by any of his Servants, or others, before the Ordinary Revenue there become, able to sustain the necessary charge of that Crown, and the Debts there of befully cleared.</HI></P>
<P>This is most reasonable, it standing with no sound rule of Judgment, to exercise the Acts of bounty in a place which doth not discharge it self, and will prove the readiest and most expedient way to recover his Ma|jesties affairs thereby, thus carrying the Re|venues in their natural Channell; and indeed
<PB N="147" REF="82">
this course being constantly pursu'd, will much encrease the annual profits above what they now are, and intirely draw the dependance of the inferiors from the great Lords upon his Majesty, and so the interest and assurance the Crown shall have in the Natives thereof, be of no less consequence and advantage than the very profits:</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That there be an express Caveat entred with the Secretary, Signet, Privy Seal and Great Seal here, That no Grant, of what nature soever, concerning</HI> Ireland, <HI>be suffered to pass, till the Lord Lieutenant be made acquainted, and it first pass the seal of that Kingdom, according to the usual manner.</HI></P>
<P>This will be of great intelligence and safe|ty to his Majesty; for on the one side he will clearly see into the true inward value all things, which formerly, albeit of very great worth, have from so great a distance slipt away here, as little understood by the Crown; as is acknowledged by those that obtain them; who generally, in these cau|ses, sacrifice rather to their own Wit, than the Goodness and Bounty of Kings. And on the other side, nothing can pass to the disadvantage of the Crown; and proper
<PB N="148" REF="83">
Ministers, instructed with these Affairs, may be immediately faulted and justly called to a severe Account for their Negligence and Un|faithfulness therein; which will give them good reason to look more narrowly into his Majesties Rights, and their own Duties.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That His Majesty Signify his Royal Plea|sure, that special Care be taken hereafter, that sufficient and credible Persons be cho|sen to supply such Bishopricks as shall be void, or admitted of his Privy Councel, or sit as Iudges, and serve of his learned Councel there; that he will vouchsafe to hear the ad|vice of his Lieutenant before he resolve of any in these cases, that the Lieutenant be commanded to inform his Majesty truly and impartially, of every mans particular Dili|gence, and Care in his Service there, to the end his Majesty may truly and graciously re|ward the well-deserving, by calling them home to better preferment here.</HI></P>
<P>This will advantage the service; it being altogether impossible for the Lieutenant, be he never so industrious and able, to ad|minister the publick Justice of so great a Kingdom, without the round assistance of other able and well-affected Ministers. This will encourage the best men to spend
<PB N="149" REF="83">
their stronger years there, when they shall see their elder age recompensed with ease and profit in their own native Soyl; and content and settle the Natives, when they find themselves cared for, and put in the hands of discreet and good men to go|vern them.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>That no particular Complaints of Injustice or Oppression be admitted here against any, unless it appears, That the Party made first his Address unto the Lieutenant.</HI></P>
<P>This is but justice to the Lieutenant, who must needs in some measure be a delinquent, if the complaint be true; for that he ought as in chief, universally to take care that his Ma|jesties Justice be truly and fully administered; and therefore good reason that his Judgment should be informed, and his integrity first tryed, before either be impeached; Nay, it is but justice to the Government it self, which would be exceedingly Scandalized through the liberty of complaints, and the Ministers therein extreamly discouraged upon any petty matter, to be drawn to an|swer here, when as the thing it self is for the most part either Injurious or such as the par|ty might have received good satisfaction for at his own doors: but where the complaint
<PB N="150" REF="84">
appeareth formally grounded, that is, where due application hath been made to the Lieu|tenant, without any help or relief to the party, as may be pretended; let it in the name of God be throughly examined, and severely punished, wheresoever the fault prove to be; especially if it be found to be corrupt or malitious: for thus shall not his Majesty only magnify his own Justice, but either punish an unfaithful Minister, or a clamorous Complainer; and so his Service be better'd by either example.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>That no Confirmation of any Reversion of Office within that Kingdom be had, or any new Grant of Reversion hereafter to pass.</HI></P>
<P>That disposing of Places thus aforehand, much abates mens endeavours, who are many times stirred up to deserve eminently in the Commonwealth, in hope of those preferments; and being thus granted away, there is nothing left in their Eye, for them to expect and aim at, which might nourish and quicken those good desires in them, be|sides Places there closely and covertly pas|sed, the persons are not for the most part so able and fitted to the Duties thereof, as when there is choice made out of many pub|lick pretenders, which commonly oc|cur,
<PB N="151" REF="84">
when they actually fall void by Death.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>That the Places in the Lieutenants Gift, as well in the Martial as Civil List, be left freely to his disposing; and that his Majesty may be graciously pleased not to pass them to any person, upon Suits made unto him here.</HI></P>
<P>This course held, preserves the Rights of the Lieutenants Place, and his Person in that Honour and Esteem which can only enable him to do service; and if the contra|ry happen, it is not only in diminution to him, but draws off all necessary dependance upon him, and regard that ought to be had of him, in all ready obedience in such things he shall command, for the Kings Service, when they shall discern that the natural Powers of the Place are taken from him, whereby he might kindle their chearful en|deavours by the preferring and furnishing such as deserve those places.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>That no New Offices be erected within that Kingdom before such time as the Lieutenant be therewith acquainted; his opinion first re|quired and certified accordingly.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="85">Suits of this Nature, however they pretend the publick, their chief end is the private Profit of the Propounder; and for the most part, in the Execution prove burthens, not benefits to the Subjects; therefore throughly to be understood before they pass, as more easy and less scandalous to the State, to be staid at first than afterwards recalled, and if they be really good, his Majesty may be better informed by his Lieutenants approba|tion, and so proceed with more assurance to the effecting thereof.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>That his Majesty would be pleased, not to grant any Licence of absence out of that King|dom, to any Councillors, Bishops, Gover|nours of any Province or County, or Officers of State, or of the Army, or to any of the Iudges, or learned Council, but that it be left to his Lieutenant to give such Licence.</HI></P>
<P>This is but reasonable, because the Lord Lieutenant who is chiefly intrusted under his Majesty with the Care and Government of that Kingdom, is the most competent and proper Judge, who in publick employment may be spared, and how long, without Prejudice to his Majesty, or the publick.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>That all Propositions moving from the Lieu|tenant, touching matters of Revenue, may
<PB N="153" REF="85">
be directed to the Lord Treasurer of <HI>En|gland</HI> only, and that the Address of all other Dispatches for that Kingdom be by special direction of his Majesty applyed to one of the Secretaries singly, and his Majesty, under his hand-Writing doth Specify, that his Majesty will have this done by Mr. Secretary Nicholas.</HI></P>
<P>These Propositions made unto his Majesty, by his Grace the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> Lord Steward of his Majesty's Houshold, and Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> were re|ceived and approved at the Council board, the 22 day of <HI>Iune</HI> 1662, there being present the King's most excellent Majesty his Royal Highness the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> his Highness Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Treasurer, Duke of <HI>Albemarle,</HI> Duke of <HI>Or|mond,</HI> Marquess of <HI>Dorchester,</HI> Lord Great Chamberlain, Lord Chamberlain, Earl of <HI>Barkshire,</HI> Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> Earl of <HI>Nor|wich,</HI> Earl of <HI>Anglesey,</HI> Earl of <HI>Lauderdail,</HI> the Lord <HI>Hatton,</HI> Lord <HI>Hollis,</HI> Lord <HI>Ashly,</HI> Sir William <HI>Compton,</HI> Mr. Treasurer, Mr. Vice Chamberlain, Mr Secretary Nicholas, Mr. Secretary <HI>Morris.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1 VVHEREAS many are forced to pay 1/10 of their whole Estates towards the raising of but 70000<HI>l. per Mensem,</HI> besides what they pay more insensibly and directly, as Customs, Excise, Chimny-Money, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> they pay 2<HI>d. per Mensem per</HI> Pound Rent, that is 2 <HI>s. per Annum,</HI> or 1/10 of the whole.) It must come to pass, that the same Per|sons must from <HI>Christmas,</HI> 1665. pay &frac13; of their whole Estates, if the War with <HI>Hol|land</HI> continue two years longer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> at the value of the last years Expence, provided His Ma|jesty be kept out of Debt.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="2" REF="114">2. But if the Publick Charge were laid proportionably, no Man need pay above 1/10 of his whole Effects, even in case the Tax should rise to 250 000 <HI>l. per Mensem,</HI> which God forbid.</P>
<P N="3">3. That is to say, according to the pre|sent ways, some pay four times as much more as they ought, or needed; which disproportion is the true and proper Grie|vance of Taxes, and which must be felt when the Tax happens to be great and ex|traordinary: Whereas by meer Method and Proportion, the same may be corrected as aforesaid; and withal, just Accounts might be kept of the People, with the re|spective Increases and Decreases of them, their Wealth, and Foreign Trade.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="3" REF="114">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Containing several Computations of the Wealth of the Kingdom.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THERE are of Men, Women, and Children, in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales,</HI> about six Millions, whose Expence at 6 <HI>l.</HI> 13 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d. per Annum,</HI> or near 4&frac12; <HI>d. per Diem,</HI> for Food, Housing, Cloaths, and all other necessaries, amount to 40 Millions, <HI>per Annum.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. There are in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales,</HI> of Acres of Land (worth 6 <HI>l.</HI> 1 <HI>s.</HI> 8 <HI>d. per</HI> Acre, and 18 years purchase) 24 Millions, that is, which yields 8 Millions <HI>per Annum</HI> Rent, and which are worth 144 Millions to be sold.</P>
<P N="3">3. There be 28000 Houses within the Liberties of the City of <HI>London,</HI> worth 15 <HI>l. per Annum,</HI> and twelve years purchase (<HI>viz.</HI> which yield 420,000 <HI>l. per Annum,</HI> and are worth 5,040000 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="115">There are without the Liberties, but within the Bills of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ortality &frac14; more in number, perhaps not of greater value, <HI>viz.</HI> 5,040000 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. There is in all <HI>England</HI> and <HI>VVales</HI> near ten times as many Chimneys as with|in the Liberties of <HI>London,</HI> as appears by the Returns; Whereof those within the Bills are &frac13; of the whole.</P>
<P N="5">5. 'Tis probable, that the Housing of all the Cities and Market-Towns, are double in number to those of all <HI>London,</HI> though of no more worth.</P>
<P N="6">6. 'Tis also probable, that the Housing without the Cities and Towns, are more in number than those within (<HI>London</HI> except|ed) but of no more value.</P>
<P N="7">7. So as the Housing of <HI>England</HI> may be estimated worth 30 millions; and that if their values be estimated by Chimneys, those of <HI>London</HI> are worth 12 <HI>d. per</HI> Chim|ney; those in the Suburbs 10 <HI>d.</HI> other Cities and Market-Towns 6 <HI>d.</HI> and those without both, about 4 <HI>d.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. The Shipping of <HI>England,</HI> &amp;c. is a|bout 500 000 Tuns, which at 6 <HI>d. per</HI> Tun, including their Ordnance, Apparel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is worth three millions.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="5" REF="115">9. The Stock of Cattel on the afore|mentioned 24 millions of Land, and the Waste thereunto belonging, is worth &frac14; of the said Land, <HI>viz.</HI> 36 millions compre|hending Horses, Oxen, Sheep, Swine, Deer, Fisheries, Parks and Warrens.</P>
<P N="10">10. The Coined Gold and Silver of the Kingdom, is scarce worth six millions</P>
<P N="11">11. The Wares, Merchandizes, and Uten|sils of Plate, and Furnitures, may be estima|ted at 31 millions to make the Ships and Money 40. and the whole 250 millions.</P>
<P N="12">12. The most uncertain part of this Esti|mate, seems to be rating personal Estates at above 30 Millions, which I make probable thus.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>(1) First it is not unlikely that what is con|tained in all the Shops, Warehouses, Cellars, Barns, and Graineries, together with House|hold Furniture, Cloaths, Ornaments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> should be less worth than Housing it self that contains them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(2) If the value of all the Cattel, <HI>viz.</HI> 36 millions, were added to the 31 personal Estates, making 67 together; both will not make up 1&frac34; years Provision for the whole Nation, whose Expence we estimated at 40 millions <HI>per annum</HI>; and poorer than so, we hope it is not.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="6" REF="116">(3.) I find by the particular estimate of the values of all the Plate, Lead, Iron, Copper and Tin, and of all the Timber, Planks, and Woods, and of all Silks, Linnen, and Callicoes; of all Clothes, Stuffs, and Lea|thers; of all Grains, and Salts, and of all Wines, Oyles, and other Liquids; of all Grocery and Spicery, and Drugs; of Jew|els, and Hangings, Beds, and other Orna|ments, (too troublesome to particularize) that this general Account may stand.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(4.) The City of <HI>London</HI> being commonly esteemed and rated at the 15<HI>th</HI> part of the whole, which we reckon at 250 Millions, that is 16 &frac23;. I think the sum may be well made up by reckoning 5 &frac16; Millions for the Housing as aforesaid, and 1 &frac12; for the Shipping (half the Shipping of the Nation belonging to <HI>London</HI>) and about the double of the va|lue of the Housing for what is contained in them. The which upon considering many several Houses, I find not unreasonable.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(Lastly,) supposing that in the Houses within the Liberties of <HI>London</HI> (worth 5 Millions) there be 10 Millions worth of Goods; I conceive that to allow about as much more, <HI>viz.</HI> 21 Millions) to all the rest of the Houses in the Kingdom, which are ten times as many as aforesaid, will not overcharge them.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="13"><PB N="7" REF="116">13. Now if the Land worth 144 Mil|lions, yield 8 Millions <HI>per annum,</HI> the other Estate converted into the like Species must yield 5 8/9 more; but because Money and other personal Estates yield more <HI>per annum</HI> than Land; (that is) doubles it self under 17 years purchase at 6 <HI>l. per centum,</HI> then in|stead of 5 8/9, suppose it to yield 7, making the whole Annual Proceed 15.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the Value of the <HI>PEOPLE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NOW if the Annual proceed of the Stock, or Wealth of the Nation, yields but 15 millions, and the expence be 40. Then the labour of the People must furnish the other 25; which may be done, if but half of them, <HI>viz.</HI> 3 millions earned but 8 <HI>l.</HI> 6 <HI>s.</HI> 8 <HI>d. per annum,</HI> which is done at 7 <HI>d. per diem,</HI> abating the 52 Sundays, and half as many other days for accidents as Holy days, sickness, recreations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. If &frac16; of these 3 millions earned but 2 <HI>d. per diem</HI>; another &frac16; 4 <HI>d.</HI> another &frac16; 8 <HI>d. per diem,</HI> another 10 <HI>d.</HI> and another 12 <HI>d.</HI> The medium will be this, 7 <HI>d. per diem.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="8" REF="117">3. Whereas the Stock of the Kingdom, yielding but 15 Millions of proceed, is worth 250 Millions; then the People who yield 25, are worth 416 &frac23; Millions. For al|though the Individiums of Mankind be reckoned at about 8 years purchase; the Species of them is worth as many as Land, being in its nature as perpetual, for ought we know.</P>

If 6 Millions of People be worth 417 millions of pounds <HI>Sterling,</HI> then each head is worth 69 <HI>l.</HI> or each of the 3 millions of Workers is worth 138 <HI>l.</HI> which is 7 years purchase, at about 12 <HI>d. per diem</HI>; nor is superlucration above his subsistence to be reckoned in this Case.</P>
<P N="5">5. From whence it follows, that 100,000, persons dying of the Plague, above the or|dinary number, is near 7 Millions loss to the Kingdom; and consequently how well might 70,000<HI>l.</HI> have been bestowed in pre|venting this Centuple loss?</P>
<P N="6">6. We said, that the late mortality by the Pest, is a great loss to the Kingdom; whereas some think it but a seasonable dis|charge of its Pestilent humours: to clear which difficulty, I say,</P>
<P N="7">7. If the Plague discerned well, between the well and the ill-affected to Peace and Obe|dience,
<PB N="9" REF="117">
or between the <HI>Bees</HI> and the <HI>Drones,</HI> the Fact would determine the Question: But if it destroy promiscuously, the Loss is pro|portionable to the Benefit we have by them that survive; for 'tis they that make <HI>Eng|land</HI> worth above 600 millions, as aforesaid: It being certain, That if one person only had escaped: the whole Territory, and all that is in it, had been worth but a liveli|hood for that one; and he subject to be a prey to the next two that should invade him.</P>
<P N="8">8. It seems reasonable, that what we call the Wealth, Stock, or Provision of the Nation, being the effect of the former or past labour, should not be conceived to dif|fer from efficiencies in being, but should be rated alike, and contribute alike to the com|mon necessities: And then of all and every summ to be raised, the Land and Stock must pay 3 parts; and the People consider|ed without any Estate at all, 5 more; the whole into 8 divided.</P>
<P N="9">9. If the expence of the Nation be 40 Millions; it seems but the same hard|ship to set apart 4. <HI>viz.</HI> 1/10 of the whole for the publick use, as what now lies upon many already: But 4 Millions would af|ford one for the ordinary Expence, and
<PB N="10" REF="118">
three for the extraordinary Wars, that is 250 000 <HI>l. per mensem</HI>; that is 3 &frac12; as much as 70. For the raising whereof, many now pay above a 1/10 of their whole Estates, for want of Method and Proportion.</P>
<P N="10">10. Labouring men work 10 hours <HI>per diem,</HI> and make 20 meals <HI>per</HI> week, <HI>viz.</HI> 3 a day for working-days, and two on <HI>Sundays</HI>; whereby it is plain, that if they could fast on <HI>Fryday</HI> nights, and Dine in one hour and an half, whereas they take two, from eleven to one; thereby this working 1/20 more, and spending 1/20 less, the 1/10 abovementioned might be raised, at least with more ease, than to take up Arms, and resist it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of Money; and how much is necessary to drive the Trade of the Nation.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IT may be asked, If there were occasion to raise 4 <HI>Millions per Annum,</HI> whether the same 6 <HI>Millions</HI> (which we hope we have) would suffice for such revolutions and circulations thereof as Trade requires? I answer yes; for the Expence being 40 Mil|lions, if the revolutions were in such short Circles, <HI>viz.</HI> weekly, as happens among poor Artizans and Labourers, who receive and pay every <HI>Saturday,</HI> then 40/52 parts of 1 Million of Money would answer those ends: But if the Circles be quarterly, ac|cording to our Custom of paying rent, and gathering Taxes, then 10 Millions were re|quisite. Wherefore supposing payments in general to be of a mixt Circle between One
<PB N="14" REF="120">
week and 13. then add 10 Millions to 40/52, the half of the which will be 5 1&frac13;, so as if we have 5 &frac12; Millions, we have enough.</P>
<P N="2">2. And thus I have shewed, That if one half of the Subjects of <HI>England</HI> (playing 78 days in the year) will earn 7 <HI>d. per diem</HI> all the rest of the days one with another; And if they would work 1/20 more, and spend 1/20 less, they might enable their King to main|tain double the Forces he now doth, with|out suffering in the general more than many well affected persons do now through neg|ligence, or mistakes in their Particulars. Nor is Money wanting to answer all the Ends of a well Policed State, notwithstand|ing the great decreases thereof, which have happened within these Twenty Years.</P>
<P>Nor were it hard to substitute in the place of Money (were a competency of it wanting) what should be equivalent unto it. For Money is but the Fat of the Body-Politick, whereof too much doth as often hinder its Agility, as too little makes it sick. 'Tis true, that as Fat lubricates the motion of the Muscles, feeds in want of Victuals, fills up uneven Cavities, and beautifies the Body; so doth Money in the State quicken its Action, feeds from abroad in time of Dearth at home; evens accounts by reason
<PB N="15" REF="120">
of it's divisibility, and beautifies the whole, altho more especially the particular persons that have it in plenty.</P>

<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VI. The Causes of irregular Taxing.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE Causes of Error in this great Affair of Publick Levies, have been these. First, Laying too great a stress on the matter of Money, which is to the whole effect of the Kingdom but as 6 to 667. That is, not one to 100. Secondly, Laying the whole Burthen on the past Effects, and neglecting the present Efficien|cies, exceeding the former as 417 doth 250. Thirdly, Reckoning all the personal E|states of the City of <HI>London</HI> (Shipping included) at scarce &frac12; the value of the very Housing, whereas they are double: Which happens because the Housing of <HI>London</HI> belongs to the Church, Companies, or Gen|tlemen, and are taxed by the Citizens their Tenants. Fourthly, A fallacious tenderness towards the poor, (who now pay scarce 1 <HI>s. per</HI> head <HI>per ann.</HI> towards all manner of charges) interwoven with the cruelty of not
<PB N="16" REF="121">
providing them Work, and indulging Lazi|ness in them, because of our own indisposi|tion to employ them; so some are over|charged through evil Custom, and others left to sordid Want, and bruitish Irregulari|ty. Fifthly, An Opinion, that certainty of Rules is impossible, and but an idle Noti|on; and then having made such as are not so, and training them to be applied by Af|fection and Humour; so as &frac14; of the whole paying needlesly four times too much, may be thereby so netled, as to do more mischief than the other unconcerned, and thankless &frac34; can allay.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. The Collateral Advantages of these Taxes.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. BEsides the equality of Taxes, we make this further use of trying it by way of Customs, Poles, Excises, Chim|ney-money, Land-tax, and Assesments upon the personal Estates, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>(1.) Of the Customs, which we reduce from 1/40 to 1/50, to keep an account of Foreign&punc;
<PB N="17" REF="121">
Trade, and of its Balance; for by Levying, a Duty, and encreasing the Penalty, these Ac|counts will be less obscured.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(2.) The simple and universal Pole keeps an account of the great Wealth and Strength of the Kingdom, the People.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(3.) Rating the Houses <HI>per</HI> Chimney, gives a good account of Improvements and Dilapidations.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(4.) Excize gives an account of Domestick Expences, and publisheth Exorbitances.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(5.) Land-taxes keep the Payments to the proportion of entire value, not of Annual Rent: So as an Estate in Housing pays no more than if it were in Lands, nor conside|rable less than Goods, and may bring Mort|gages to their just contribution; many Len|ders not being so formidable for their Money, as some have thought them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(6.) Assessments upon personal Estates (if given in as elsewhere upon Oath) would bring that Branch which of it self is most dark, to a sufficient clearness.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="2">2. There is also a Pole upon Titles and Dignities worth consideration, tho we now omit it; which as it may check mens forwardness to undeserved Pre-eminence, so it may be employed in the encouragement of true worth.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="18" REF="122">3. We have hitherto computed the old immutable Revenue at but 130,000 <HI>l. per an|num,</HI> nor supposed above 170,000 <HI>l. (viz.</HI> less than &frac12; what it is at present) to be raised by Customs (wholly neglecting Wards, Butlerage, Aulnage, and other obsolete Im|posts.) We have also designed the several Proportions towards the raising of a Million more <HI>per Ann.</HI> to be raised by the Pole, Ex|cise, Land-Tax, Assessments and Chimneys.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Of the Expence of the Navy, Army, and Ga|risons.</HEAD>
<P>WE come next to shew, That if 3 Mil|lions <HI>per ann.</HI> or 250,000 <HI>l. per men|sem</HI> (to make up the whole 3,300,000<HI>l. per ann.</HI>) were raised, what might be performed thereby for the safety, establishment, and Honour both of the King and Subject.</P>
<P>Unto which, I say, considering the pre|sent condition of the Navy, two Millions will maintain 50,000 men, in Ships of War for eight Months of the Year, and 30000 for the other four Months: Which I take to be near double the best Fleet we ever have

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Motives to the quiet bearing of extraordinary TAXES.</HEAD>
<P>HAving shewed how great and glorious things may be done with no less diffi|culty than what &frac14; of the King's Subjects do already endure; I offer these further Rea|sons
<PB N="20" REF="123">
to quiet mens Minds, in case this utmost 250,000 <HI>l. per mensem</HI> should be ever de|manded upon this <HI>Holland-War.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. That of all Naval Expence, not 1/20 is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or Forreign Commodities, nor need it be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f, if the people would do their part, and the Governours direct them the nearest ways.</P>
<P N="2">2. That stoppage of Trade is considera|ble, but as one to eight; for we exchange not above five Millions worth <HI>per ann.</HI> for our 40.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the Expence of the King, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> being about 400,000 <HI>l. per ann.</HI> is but 1/100 part of the Expence of the Nation, who all have the Pleasure and Honour of it.</P>
<P N="4">4. That the Money of the Nation being but about 5 Millions and &frac12;, and the earning of the same 25; It is not difficult for them to encrease their Money a Million <HI>per ann.</HI> by an easie advance of their Industry, apply|ed to such Manufactures as will fetch Mo|ney from abroad.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Wealth of <HI>England</HI> lies in Land and People, so as they make five parts of six of the whole: But the Wealth of <HI>Holland</HI> lies more in Money, Housing, Shipping and Wares. Now supposing <HI>England</HI> three|times
<PB N="21" REF="123">
as rich as <HI>Holland</HI> in Land, and People (as it is) and <HI>Holland</HI> twice as rich as we in other Particulars (as it scarce is); We are still upon the Balance of the whole near twice as rich as they: Of which I wish those that understand <HI>Holland,</HI> would consi|der and calculate.</P>
<P N="6">6. There are in <HI>England</HI> above four Acres of Arrable, Meadow and Pasture-Land, for every Soul in it; and those so fertile, as that the labour of one man in tilling them, is suf|ficient to get a bare Livelihood for above 10: So as 'tis for want of Discipline that any Poverty appears in <HI>England,</HI> and that any are hanged or starved upon that ac|count.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="22" REF="124">
<HEAD>CHAP. X. How to employ the People, and the End thereof.</HEAD>
<P>WE said, That half the People by a very gentle labour, might much enrich the Kingdom, and advance its Honour, by setting apart largely for publick uses; But the difficulty is, upon what shall they employ themselves.</P>
<P>To which I answer in general, Upon pro|ducing Food and Necessaries for the whole People of the Land, by few hands; whether by labouring harder, or by the introducing the Compendium, and Facilitations of Art, which is equivalent to what men vain|ly hoped from <HI>Polygamy.</HI> For as much as he that can do the Work of five men by one, effects the same as the begetting four adult Workmen. Nor is such advan|tage worth fewer years purchase than that of Lands, or what we esteem likest to perpetual. Now the making Necessaries cheap, by the means aforesaid, and not by raising more of them than can be spent
<PB N="23" REF="124">
whilst they are good, will necessitate others to buy them with much labour of other kinds. For if one man could raise Corn e|nough for the whole, better than any one man; then that man would have the natu|ral Monopoly of Corn, and could exact more labour for it in exchange, than if ten others raised ten times as much Corn as is necessary; which would make other labour so much the dearer, as men were less under the need of engaging upon it.</P>
<P N="2">2. By this way we might recover our lost Cloth-trade, which by the same the <HI>Dutch</HI> got from us. By this way the <HI>East|Indians</HI> furnish us from the other end of the world with Linnen cheaper than our selves can make them, with what grows at our own Doors. By this means we might fetch Flax from <HI>France,</HI> and yet furnish them with Linnen (that is) if we make no more than we can vend, but so much with the fewest hands, and cheapest food, which will be when Food also is raised, by fewer hands than elsewhere.</P>
<P N="3">3. I answer generally we should em|ploy our selves by raising such Commodi|ties, as would yield and fetch in money from abroad: For that would supply any wants of ours from the same, or any other place at all times. Which Stores of Dome|stick
<PB N="24" REF="125">
Commodities could not effect, whose value is to call a Temporary (<HI>i. e.</HI>) which are of value but <HI>pro hic &amp; nunc.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. But when should we rest from this great Industry? I answer, When we have certainly more Money than any of our Neighbour States, (though never so little) both in Arithmetrical and Geometrical pro|portion (<HI>i. e.</HI>) when we have more years provision aforehand, and more present effects.</P>
<P N="5">5. What then should we busie our selves about? I answer, in Ratiocinations upon the Works and Will of God, to be supported not only by the indolency, but also by the pleasure of the Body; and not only by the tranquility, but serenity of the mind; and this Exercise is the natural end of man in this world, and that which best disposeth him for his Spiritual happiness in that other which is to come. The motions of the mind being the quickest of all others, afford most variety, wherein is the very form and being of pleasure; and by how much the more we have of this pleasure, by so much the more we are capable of it even <HI>ad Infini|tum.</HI></P>
