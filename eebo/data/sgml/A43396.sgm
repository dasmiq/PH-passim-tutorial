<HEAD>An answer to the most envious, scanda|lous, and libellous Pamphlet, Entituled, MERCVRIES MESSAGE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>HOw now! what ist which I doe vainly read,</L>
<L>Ought which belongs to Popish Romish Creed?</L>
<L>I am deceiv'd, it is a Letter call'd,</L>
<L>(At which I blusht) A hypocriticke scal'd</L>
<L>Which did affront true Protestatine heads.</L>
<L>No whit belonging unto Papall Beads.</L>
<L>For such vaine trifles, O the Authors scorne,</L>
<L>Although of Riches, yet not of truth forlorne.</L>
<L>The Letter thus begins with Dash above,</L>
<L>My Lord, as if the consequence were love.</L>
<L>But read forward, and you shall truely finde,</L>
<L>No love at all, but a most envious minde.</L>
<L><HI>My Lord,</HI></L>
<L>I call you not what long agoe you were,</L>
<L>For now those golden dayes are past I feare,</L>
<L>I feare, O sycophantick and base straine,</L>
<L>Which for to name, a good man may disdaine;</L>
<L>He feares but what, Bishops will nere go downe,</L>
<L>Whose mature learning once did England crowne:</L>
<L>Suppose that some be bad, must therefore all?</L>
<L>Let bad men suffer, but the just nere fall.</L>
<L>Each rayling line, I doe not now intend</L>
<L>To answer, lest they cry me the Popes friend:</L>
<L>Onely to chiefest points I doe reply,</L>
<L>And that Ile doe although for it I die.</L>
<L>Are not we all by nature bad? why then</L>
<L>Descended Christ so low for to save men?</L>
<L>But there's a Sect i'th world which dare to say,</L>
<L>Their merits save them, what have they to pay,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="3">But such are Romanists, but w'have a Sect,</L>
<L>Which have Saint-like beleefe of which they cracke.</L>
<L>And such are those which we call Schismaticks,</L>
<L>Which thinke to gaine heaven by soothing tricks.</L>
<L>And such a one was he which lately writ</L>
<L>A Libell, to divulge his zealous wit.</L>
<L>Zealous said I? excuse me (Reader) pray,</L>
<L>Expressing zealous I m not to stay.</L>
<L>No zeale it is, maliciously to raile,</L>
<L>Against a prisoner, suppose he were fraile,</L>
<L>Let Law condemne him, not each envious pen,</L>
<L>Which sometimes will dispraise the best of men.</L>
<L>I doe not say that he was such a one,</L>
<L>That God forbid, there Ile let him alone.</L>
<L>Let Law pursue him, and God forbid againe,</L>
<L>That my rash pen should more augment his paine.</L>
<L>Hence superstition, hence base Romish weeds,</L>
<L>And hence I say all hypocriticke deeds.</L>
<L>Suppose that he bowd vainly to the Altar,</L>
<L>For that must he be hang'd with Inkie halter?</L>
<L>But he did Sermons hate, and those abuse,</L>
<L>Which to preach often piously did use.</L>
<L>Did hee doe so? in it he was too blame;</L>
<L>Let justice still obscure his once bright fame.</L>
<L>But he at name of (Jesus) still did bow,</L>
<L>Why not? dot not the Scripture it alow?</L>
<L>That at his name each knee should lowly bend;</L>
<L>Hath Scripture err'd and now at length amend?</L>
<L>But 'tis the heart must bow, out outward knee.</L>
<L>Did not God make them both? pray answer me?</L>
<L>Why at his Name then should they not both bend,</L>
<L>Which dy'd for man, his deserv'd grife to end?</L>
<L>Sure Antignist to me thou'lt subscribe,</L>
<L>If thou in hope wer't of a ten pound bribe,</L>
<L>O such a guift would make thee for to faulter,</L>
<L>Thou'st buy new shooes, and eke scrape to the Altar.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="3" MS="y">What is thy answer Libeller to this?</L>
<L>I know there's nothing comes to thee amisse.</L>
<L>Wert thou a Bishop, thou would'st then beleeve,</L>
<L>Nay swear no harme could be in a Lawne sleeve.</L>
<L>Thou wantedst money when thou writst thy Letter,</L>
<L>And by thy scandall made thy state grow better;</L>
<L>Thou art some Poet to the short hair'd crew,</L>
<L>Who long since bid to honesty adue:</L>
<L>Thou wilt not swear, but lie, I know thou wilt,</L>
<L>Thy actions are not pure, yet purely gilt,</L>
<L>Did any one your Letter much applaud,</L>
<L>Which you did dedicate to little <HI>Laud;</HI></L>
<L>Surely no wise man, and yet you rail'd well,</L>
<L>Your tongue's not fit for Billingsgate, but hell.</L>
<L>It did sell well, would'st know the reason why?</L>
<L>Each man desir'd to reade thy knavery;</L>
<L>I wonder much thy name thou durst not show,</L>
<L>That all the world thy witty parts might know;</L>
<L>It was your modesty I doe suppose,</L>
<L>Or else for feare, <HI>Brandon</HI> should get your hose,</L>
<L>Had you but heard what thankes you had for it,</L>
<L>Of all wise men, you'd curse your railing wit:</L>
<L>O what an Age i'st which we doe live in?</L>
<L>One doth offend, the other laughes at sin;</L>
<L>Christ ore Jerusalem did much lament,</L>
<L>He sorry was for sin it should be shent;</L>
<L>But man triumphs his brother being in thrall,</L>
<L>Naught more doth joy him than his brothers fall&punc;</L>
<L>Arch-Bishop <HI>Laud</HI> is lately falne, and we,</L>
<L>Seeme to rejoyce at his sad misery;</L>
<L>Me thinkes for him that we should rather weepe,</L>
<L>Because by Satan he was lull'd asleepe:</L>
<L>Than triumph at his fall, we ought to pray,</L>
<L>Though Law his corps, God may not his soule slay;</L>
<L>O brawling Libeller which lately writ,</L>
<L>Meere blasphemy for to divulge thy wit:</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="4">Some of thy lines I will peruse, and then</L>
<L>A Libeller prove to be the worst of men.</L>
<L>Blest were the man could light on such good hap.</L>
<L>To beat out's eyes with's Babylonian Cap,</L>
<L>With some quaint jeere to breake your Graces pate,</L>
<L>Our wits imployed are early and late.</L>
<L>We scorne sayes one, his vices to applaud,</L>
<L>We know the Devill must have little <HI>Laud.</HI></L>
<L>O sayes a second, hee's a gallant prize,</L>
<L>And by his fall young <HI>Gregory</HI> will rise.</L>
<L>Me thinkes your Honour, yea your Honours head,</L>
<L>Hangs in the ayre by a small twisted thred.</L>
<L>Which to Heavens prayse, hels joy, and Londons wonder,</L>
<L>No further read: eye-strings will burst asunder.</L>
<L>For rage I'm filled, shivering amaze</L>
<L>Commands me further not on's lines to gaze.</L>
<L>(Blest were the man) if blessednesse it were,</L>
<L>Authority of time to stand in feare.</L>
<L>See how he soothes the world, nay seemes to pray,</L>
<L>That it the life of <HI>Laud</HI> would snatch away;</L>
<L>What is the Parliament of late growne dull,</L>
<L>Bequeathing Justice unto this base gull!</L>
<L>O farre be such a sentence from my thought,</L>
<L>I know with wisedome their heads still be fraught,</L>
<L>But yet this Varlet (marke what I shall say,)</L>
<L>From them doth seeme Justice to take away.</L>
<L>O what a fiction doth he slily raise,</L>
<L>For which he deserves more than Poets Bayse,</L>
<L>A rope to boot, (He scornes vice to applaud)</L>
<L>He knowes the Devill must have Bishop <HI>Laud,</HI></L>
<L>For so his meaning is, I dare to tell,</L>
<L>He is no man but disguis'd Fiend of Hell:</L>
<L>For mortall against mortall never had,</L>
<L>Such d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">mn'd expression, to answer which I'm sad:</L>
<L>O sinfull man, for if man so thou art,</L>
<L>Where was thy charity, O where thy fleshy heart?</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="4" MS="y">What, all compos'd of malice? tho he was</L>
<L>Perhaps thy enemy, what then? Alas,</L>
<L>Thy Saviour thousands of foes had more,</L>
<L>Aud yet to them did he shew mercy store.</L>
<L>He lov'd his foes, and for his foes did die:</L>
<L>They 'gainst him, not he them, cry'd, crucifie.</L>
<L>He lost his life, perhaps thou liberty,</L>
<L>His reason was, to cure mans misery.</L>
<L>I grieve to read thy foolery, weepe to see,</L>
<L>How each line patcht up is with mockery:</L>
<L>Thou mayst report me to be Romanist,</L>
<L>Because I strive for to dissolve thy mist</L>
<L>Of ignorance; Hadst thou here thy owne blame,</L>
<L>Thou wouldst not shew thy selfe for very shame;</L>
<L>An Hypocrite of all men is the worst,</L>
<L>Of all good men abhorr'd and held accurst.</L>
<L><HI>Iudas</HI> will answer, Master is it I,</L>
<L>When as his heart was full of treachery;</L>
<L><HI>Absalom</HI> his father flatter often did,</L>
<L>And yet within his breast lay Treason hid:</L>
<L><HI>Saul</HI> made a shew that he did <HI>Davd</HI> love,</L>
<L>And yet his life he sought for to remove.</L>
<L>Thou writ'st satyricke: yet I doe beleeve,</L>
<L>Should he acquitted be and longer live;</L>
<L>Thou wouldst most willingly his Chaplaine be,</L>
<L>Hence, hence deceit, hence damb'd hypocrisie.</L>
<L>Ye are the Devils golden glittering baites,</L>
<L>Your outsides faire, your inward base deceits.</L>
<L>Wise men doe shun such old ore gilded walles,</L>
<L>Which doe triumph ore Fortunes Tennis bals.</L>
<L>No <HI>Canterburian</HI> I, though Kentish borne,</L>
<L>I shun his actions, and his censure scorne.</L>
<L>Yet give me leave for to lament his case,</L>
<L>Let me be sorry for his want of grace,</L>
<L>Wich once so gracious was, don't him deride,</L>
<L>But draw example from his lofty pride.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5">Let Justice take his corps, but let all pray,</L>
<L>His soule may goe the narrow and straight way:</L>
<L>Now Libeller fare well, and the next time,</L>
<L>Assault no prisoner with thy envious rime.</L>
