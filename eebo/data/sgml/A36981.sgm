<L>I That so often in soft Lyrick Strains,</L>
<L>Was us'd to please the mirthful Nymphs and Swains;</L>
<L>My Lute and Harp upon the Willows hung,</L>
<L>Like the sad <HI>Iews,</HI> now tune my mournful Song.</L>
<L>Forc'd from Delight, and Musick's sprightly Joys,</L>
<L>In Grief's hoarse Voyce to chaunt sad Obsequies:</L>
<L>Oh! therefore Thou, who nobly canst inspire</L>
<L>A frozen <HI>Genius</HI> with Poetick Fire;</L>
<L>Who <HI>Pegasus</HI> a lofty Flight canst Wing,</L>
<L>And teach thy Bard of mighty Deaths to sing;</L>
<L>With thy best Influence my Brain refine,</L>
<L>And let my Thought be like the Theme Divine;</L>
<L>Heart-wounding Sorrow let my Verse infuse,</L>
<L>And in this Work assist me, <HI>Sacred Muse.</HI></L>

<L>One fatal Day damn'd in the Book of Fate,</L>

<L>When Two great Hosts of equal Power</L>

<L>For lo, whilst on this happy Place,</L>
<L>With sullen Aspect, and Hearts void of Grace,</L>
<L>They cast around their envious Eyes,</L>
<L>Like Mizers on another's Golden Joyes;</L>
<L>Or <HI>Satan,</HI> when he first saw Paradise,</L>
<L>A Trumpet loud was heard to sound,</L>
<L>Which echoing from the vaulted Ground,</L>
<L>Made known to each Spectator there,</L>
<L>The Royal Mistress of the Pile was near:</L>
<L>Scarce could they look but th' glittering Coach was seen,</L>
<L>Dazling all Eyes with its rich weight the <HI>Queen.</HI></L>
<L>Who came to view the pleasurable Seat,</L>
<L>Where she design'd in Summer her retreat;</L>
<L>And now the Buds that Frosty Winter aw'd,</L>
<L>Blest by her Beams, began to peep abroad;</L>
<L>The Earth felt genial heat, and every Flower</L>
<L>Sprung forth, to prove Her influencing Power:</L>
<L>Each Statue seem'd to bow its humble Head,</L>
<L>And as some new <HI>Pigmalion</HI> had made</L>
<L>More Images, and did some God invoke</L>
<L>To give 'em Breath, and every one had spoke:</L>
<L>Such face of lively utterance had they,</L>
<L>Whilst every speaking Gesture seem'd to say,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="6"><HI>Enter bright Goddess here, and bless your Throne,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Fix'd now for Ages, enter to your own.</HI></L>
<L>She did, and now there was no need to be</L>
<L>As in old Times, a Houshold Deity:</L>
<L>Defence more strongly was prepar'd,</L>
<L>She was the Mansion's Sacred Guard:</L>
<L>Her Eyes were <HI>Lares</HI> and <HI>Penates</HI> too,</L>
<L>That upon all around auspicious Blessings threw.</L>
<L>Then straight the bustling Train about her throng,</L>
<L>Watching each Nod or Accent of her Tongue.</L>
<L>The happy Creatures by her influence bred,</L>
<L>That daily on her Bounty fed,</L>
<L>With an officious Dilligence strove</L>
<L>T' express their Duty and their Love,</L>
<L>By entertaining her with talk</L>
<L>Of this or t'other Walk;</L>
<L>How Artful the Contrivance was, how Good:</L>
<L>Or from some Window where She stood,</L>
<L>Of such sweet Flowers, rarely seen,</L>
<L>This pleasant Tree, that pretty Green;</L>
<L>Whilst She, full of Humility's best Grace,</L>
<L>An easie Goodness shining in her Face,</L>
<L>Answers returns, so soft and free,</L>
<L>So far from Pride, or thought of Dignity,</L>
<L>As if all Speakers there were of the same Degree.</L>
<L>Each Word She spoke, like Magick charm'd,</L>
<L>And every Hearer's Bosom warm'd;</L>
<L>The glad Attendants list'ning'all stood by;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="6">All bless'd jointly with silent Joy,</L>

<L>An humble Off-spring of <HI>Apollo</HI>'s Race,</L>
<L>I, fortunate, had in Her Eyes found Grace;</L>
<L>And to each sacred <HI>Muse</HI>'s Ear</L>
<L>The joyful News could bear,</L>
<L>That SHE</L>
<L>Not only was Goddess of Vertue, Clemency,</L>
<L>Of Beauty; but, what's more, <HI>a Patroness of Poetry.</HI></L>
<L>My Lyrick <HI>Genius</HI> Honour'd with Her Praise,</L>
<L>My Tow'ring Thoughts so high did raise,</L>
<L>How poor to me seem'd Publick Fame! How wither'd look'd the Bays!</L>
<L>Dramatick Fancy too could cause,</L>
<L>From Her Angelick Courtesie, Applause,</L>
<L>When on the Stage at <HI>Sancho</HI>'s Comick Toil,</L>
<L>She graciously would condescend to smile:</L>
<L>And whilst Her Mirth did th' Crowding Court engage,</L>
<L>I, in my turn, laugh'd too, at the poor Snarler's of the Age.</L>
<L>Nor was Her Praise, like others, only Sound;</L>
<L>But with a full Hand back'd, and Royal Bounty crown'd,</L>
<L>Far more than my Ambition could desire,</L>
<L>Or my few Services require.</L>
<L>Hold here, my Muse; pull back thy Reins;</L>
<L>Let <HI>Pegasus</HI> no longer here take pains,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="7">Her numerous Vertues, or my Loss t'express;</L>

<L>And with exalted Fancy strove t'express</L>
<L>Great <HI>Gloriana's,</HI> and in Hers, thy Happiness.</L>
<L>In Words of deepest Horrour now relate</L>

<L>The Sun now posting to his wat'ry Bed,</L>
<L>The Evening was with gloomy Clouds o'er-spread,</L>
<L>The <HI>Queen,</HI> that saw his Race was almost run,</L>
<L>In hast prepar'd too to be gone:</L>
<L>The Charioteer obeys, the Horses proudly Neigh.</L>
<L>And now, as if they knew</L>
<L>The Glorious Weight they drew,</L>
<L>With an unusual Swiftness cut the yielding Way:</L>
<L>I homewards too retir'd;</L>
<L>But found my self, alas! not now inspir'd</L>
<L>With any <HI>Genius</HI> for Poetry,</L>
<L>Such as they on these Occasions us'd to be.</L>
<L>But ominous Melancholy press'd</L>
<L>My Spirits, and with strange Infection fill'd my Breast.</L>
<L>The Faculties and Orders of my Soul,</L>
<L>Thoughts sad as Death did now controul:</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="7">I hastned to my Bed, but could not rest,</L>
<L>Till with long Watching tir'd, a troubled Slumber eas'd</L>
<L>My weary'd Sense, or rather fatal Numbness seiz'd</L>
<L>My vital Parts all o'er, whilst to my Eye</L>
<L>In visionary Scenes was shewn this Prodigy.</L>

<L>A Royal Banquet in a spacious Place,</L>
<L>Hung round with Arras, figuring the Race</L>
<L>Of Gods, of Hero's, and of Kings,</L>
<L>And wondrous Stories of most wondrous Things,</L>
<L>Methought I saw prepar'd; at which, in State,</L>
<L>The Gracious <HI>Gloriana</HI> sate;</L>
<L>Around her all the Nobles of the Land,</L>
<L>Those that bore Office and Command,</L>
<L>Place, or Dependance from the Crown,</L>
<L>With others also that had none.</L>
<L>In order were grave Heads that Miters wore,</L>
<L>Grandees that held White Rods, Judges in Robes with Furr;</L>
<L>And round the Hall on large Degrees rais'd high,</L>
<L>Another August Company,</L>
<L>The great Supporters of the Diadem,</L>
<L>And of the Nations Glory and Esteem.</L>
<L>The <HI>English</HI> Commons sate,</L>
<L>Like the Disposers of Resolving Fate,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="8">Who from the prying Crowd did Reverence draw,</L>
<L>By Looks with signs of Knowledge grac'd, and Legislative Awe.</L>
<L>Next these were mix'd a Number more</L>
<L>Promiscuously, that Office bore;</L>
<L>And each in's happy Station did reveal</L>
<L>The secret Joy his Heart did feel,</L>
<L>Down from the Pages that attend, up to the Potent Seal.</L>
<L>And now the tuneful Fancy's chief Delight,</L>
<L>Musick, made brisk the Pleasure of the Night:</L>
<L>Rare Comick Artists enter straight the Place,</L>
<L>Creatures of <HI>Harlequin's</HI> diverting Race,</L>
<L>And skill'd in Gesture, Humour, and Grimace,</L>
<L>And to the Pleasure of the Feast.</L>
<L>Next these, to entertain the Royal Guest,</L>
<L>A Troop of Youths, all like <HI>Adonis</HI> dress'd,</L>
<L>When <HI>Venus</HI> first her warm Desire express'd,</L>
<L>A Bevy of sweet Virgins led to Dance,</L>
<L>Young, innocent, and fair,</L>
<L>As Nature's primitive Off-spring were.</L>
<L>An artful Measure newly taught from <HI>France,</HI></L>
<L>The Flutes and Hautboys proving still,</L>
<L>Their charming Notes and choicest Skill;</L>
<L>Action and Musick striving there to be</L>
<L>Best in their kind; yet to divert, agree.</L>
