<NOTE PLACE="marg">Martial.</NOTE>
<P>This emboldeneth mee to offer to your Highnesse patronage this little Treatise which first I dedicated to your Highnesse honorable seruant, of good memory, the Earle of Dunbar, and presented to himselfe in writing, while hee was here in this Country, but before it could be finished by the Printer, he was taken away
<PB REF="3">
by bitter and vntimely Death. For so, after that memorable saying of <HI>Plinius secundus,</HI> iustly may I tell it. <HI>Mihi acerba semper, &amp; im|matura videtur esse mors illorum, qui immortale aliquid parant: Nam qui voluptatibus dediti quasi in diem viuunt, viuendi causas quotidi&egrave; finiunt, qui vero posteros cogitant, &amp; memoriam su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> operis ostendunt, his nulla mors non immatura est, vt quae semper inchoatum aliquid abrumpat.</HI> But of this, what I might speake, (I doubt not) vvith your Highnesse approbation, and of such your Maiesties subiects as loue truth, and peace, I dare not:
<Q>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<HI>Nam vulneramentis Intempestiu&egrave;, qui mouet illa, nouat.</HI></Q>
Yet when all is reckoned to the vttermost, our account in the end is, that we can lose nothing by the death of any, so long as we enioy the be|nefite of your Highnesse life, which I pray God may be long and happy, exceeding all our dayes, who from our young yeares hath felt the sweetnesse of your Maiesties most wise, and peaceable regiment. For what he was, eyther for grauity in conuersation, or wisedome in go|uernment, he was it by your Highnesse instru|ction, as a Disciple trayned vp by your selfe: who out of the treasure of your Princely minde can imprint the like stampe of good things in others, which you did in him, if so be (which
<PB REF="157">
I must craue pardon to speake) your Highnesse fore-gather with such another obiect, as hee was, whereupon to worke. For as the Sunne in the firmament suppose he shine alike vpon ma|ny Palaces at one time, yet doth most illumi|nate those, which haue most ample windowes to receiue his light: so that if any of them be not sufficiently lightsome, the fault is not in the Sunne, but in themselues, for hee is alike good vnto them all, if they were alike capable of his goodnesse, so is it with a King in the middest of his Nobles, Counsailours, and spe|ciall seruants. But least I goe beyond my line, profering to stretch mine arme higher then my stature may carie it, I returne to my humble supplication, that seeing he who now translated to the Court of heauen, leades there a happy and blessed life, hath no other meane on earth, whereby to liue among men but by his good name. Your Maiestie who gaue him a wealthy and honourable life for his vertue, while he was in the body, will continue to keepe life to his name, when himselfe is gone. For thus euen in the estimation of Ethniques who had but Na|tures light, is <HI>alterum patrimonium,</HI> which in this earth is the iust reward of a vertuous life;

<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, GEORGE, EARLE OF DOVNBAR, LORD HOWME OF BARWICKE, LORD NORHAM, ONE OF THE LORDS Lieutenants of the middle Shieres of great Britayne, Captaine and Gouernour of his Maiesties Towne and Garison of Barwicke, Knight of the most Noble Order of the Garter, <HI>Lord high Treasurer of Scotland, and one of the Lords of his Maiesties most Honorable</HI> priuie Counsell, in both Kingdomes.</HEAD>
<P>_RIght Noble Lord, that which in this Treatise con|tayning the <HI>Anatomie of a true Christian,</HI> I haue publiquely proposed for the vse of many, I haue now particularly for many rea|sons dedicated to your Ho|nour, but in speciall because that which here is pointed out of the Christian, is in your Lordship
<PB REF="4">
performed in a good measure, hauing by the grace of God learned so to gouerne your life, that hi|therto in a most high and difficill calling ye haue liued <HI>si non sine peccato,</HI> if not without si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ne, (for that is not giuen to any man vpon earth, <HI>if we say we haue no sinne we deceiue our selues)</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Ioh. 1. 8.</NOTE> <HI>saltem sine crimine,</HI> at least without such offence of malitious wickednesse, as might make your Lord|ship culpable before men.</P>
<P>For your life toward God hath beene religious, as the priuate exercises of godlinesse, customable to your Lordship by your selfe and with your fami|lie, and the publique reuerence of the word, and obseruance of the Saboth in euerie place doth testi|fie. Toward his Maiestie faithfull, from a most in|ward affection, from whom yee haue learned to rule others, by learning to obey him: <HI>Optime e|nim imperandi rationem tenent, quieam bene parendo didicerunt.</HI> In your selfe a rare exam|ple, of humilitie in honour, of grauitie, tempe|rance, and sobrietie in the middest of wealth, and that in all the parts of your Lordships behauiour. Which is not a small thing, if it be considered, that as men of honour, when they doe euill <HI>plus exem|plo peccant, quam culpa,</HI> are more hurtfull by their euill example, then by their euill deede; so if they liue godly, they doe not so much good to them|selues by well doing, as to others by their good ex|ample. Toward euill men a iustitiar, not flexible
<PB REF="4">
from equity for feare or fauour. Toward good men courteous. Toward all men conscientious, that in no part of the land is there any found to murmure, or charge your Lordship with vnrighte|ousnesse, vnlesse it be such who in their blindnesse thinke the seruite of God according to his word a seruitude and bondage, not knowing <HI>quod sic ser|uire Deo, est regnare.</HI> And esteemes the law of a lawfull King a tyrannie, who because they would doe all things <HI>per vim potius quam virtutem,</HI> by violence rather then vertue; whose pleasure is to liue controling all, vncontroled of any, like <HI>Nim|rods,</HI> or the <HI>sonnes of Anak,</HI> therefore they grudge as Malecontents, that the law of the King is not, as <HI>Anarxexes</HI> spake of the lawes of <HI>Solon,</HI> like the webbes of the Ettercope, through which the greater Flyes may breake at their pleasure: where as among all reasonable men, it hath euer been receiued, as a principle, <HI>beatam esse rempub|licam, in qualex dominatur,</HI> that the common|wealth is happy, in which the law hath dominion.</P>
<P>But to returne to that which of all humane te|stimonie is the greatest, the honorable estimation his Maiestie these thirtie yeares by-gone without repenting hath had of your Lordship, stands in the hearts of all his well affected subiects, as a great commendation of your qualities, for, <HI>The plea|sure of a King is in a wise Seruant</HI> (said <HI>Salo|mon</HI>) and the honour whereunto your Lordship by
<PB REF="5">
his Maiestie is preferred, is esteemed most iustly so much the more honourable, for that the Patron of vertue, for vertues sake hath aduanced you to it. Thus by a right <HI>Marcellus,</HI> hath your way to the Temple of honour, beene by the Temple of vertue.</P>
<P>For this moderation of life so euident in your Lordship, as I haue said, euen among the naturall Philosophers was accounted for true wisedome, and learning. The practise of that golden pre|cept <HI>Nosce teipsum,</HI> they esteemed to consist in the gouernment of a man his person, and actions according to the rule of vertue, this they called the matter of wisedome, without which others, were they neuer so learned, were accounted to haue had, but the words of wisedome, such as many now a dayes we haue among vs, with whom it fareth, as of olde with <HI>Thales Milesius,</HI> who going out on a night to his contemplation, while hee gazed on the starres, hee fell into the ditch. Many such Disciples I say hath he left behind him, who looke so high with their learning, that they take no heede to their owne feete, to gouerne their waies with knowledge, they thinke it sufficient to commend them, that they haue trauailed through many parts of the world, haue read much, and gotten some introduction to Sciences, when as in the meane time they neuer trauailed within themselues, neuer entred into their owne
<PB REF="5">
hearts, neuer read the booke of their owne consci|ence, and haue not learned to know, farre lesse to rule themselues by wisedome.</P>
<P>But leauing them, I trust your Lordship will still continue to seeke the perfection of true wise|dome, and knowledge there, where ye haue got|ten the beginnings, for as <HI>the beginning of wise|dome is the feare of the Lord,</HI> said <HI>Salomon,</HI> so said he also, <HI>The end of all is, feare God, and keepe his commandements:</HI> this is the whole duety of man.</P>
<P>For this cause haue I here presented to your Honour this Description of a Christian, which not without great labour I haue collected these tenne or twelue yeares by-gone, out of the word of God, that in it your Lordship may see, what manner of man a true Christian is, how his heart is continually at his right hand, his minde vpon good things, his will waiting vpon his superiour, how a good conscience is his Paradise on earth, out of which hee will not goe, how his eye is in his forehead, vsing so the time present, that hee pro|uides for the time to come, thinking on his end, and fore-seeing that wrath which is to fall on the wicked, that he may eschew it: how he refraines his speech, when time of silence is? how he speakes in season the words of knowledge, how he ponde|reth his pathes, and ordereth all his way with equitie. In a word, how he is restored by grace
<PB REF="6">
in the regeneration to the image of God, which was his most ancient glory communicated to him by his Maker in his first creation, as more particu|larly will appeare in the <HI>Anatomie</HI> follow|ing.</P>
<P>In reading whereof, where your Lordship findes a conformity with it, I am sure it will be the matter of your ioy, and thanksgiuing to God, for the beginnings of his grace in you, where not, I hope it will encrease your Christian care to pro|ceede to a further perfection, vnto the which these prayers interiected betweene Gods precepts, and the Christians practise in euery Chapter, for your Lordships speciall vse, I trust in his grace shall be profitable for you. I haue knowne by occasion that your Lordship makes conscience of the exercise of prayer in priuate, and delights in it. I haue therefore taken the more paines to let your Lord|ship see, how God in his word teaches his children to pray in the <HI>language of Canaan,</HI> that is, in such words as are dyted by his owne Spirit, and so comming from himselfe, we may be sure will be the more welcome, and acceptable to him againe, be|ing offered in a golden censure, which is a heart purified by faith, through the mediation of Iesus Christ our Lord.</P>
<P>Accept therfore (right Noble Lord) this Chri|stian Man, who as one, who being likest vnto that which you are, at least which through grace
<PB REF="6">
would be, lookes for protection vnder your sha|dow, and offereth himselfe ready to recompence your Lordship with some comfort and instructi|on, at such time as your Lorship may haue the lea|sure to conferre with him. Thus from mine heart praying vnto God for the continuance of his fa|uour with you, which is the fountaine of all prospe|ritie, both in this life, and in the life to come. I rest.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE CHRISTIAN <HI>READER.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THis Treatise presents vnto thee a liuely image of a Christian man, as he is deli|neate in the word by him who best knowes him, that is, by the Spirit of God that begets him: wherein it shall be euident, that albeit now in the world, there be nothing rifer then the Chri|stian name, yet is there nothing rarer then the Chri|stian man. Concerning which, a singular craft of Sathan comes to be discouered; for when the Chri|stian name, which had the beginning in Antiochia came first vp in the world, Sathan did what he could by false calumnies and bloudy persecution to sup|presse it. This sect, as witnesses S. <HI>Luke</HI> euery where<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 8. 22. Act 6. Act. 16. Act. 17.</NOTE> was spoken against, and Christians were accused to be blasphemers of God, troublers of Cities, yea trou|blers of the whole world: worshippers of the Sunne, and of an Asses head, eaters of mens flesh, seditious, and vile abusers of their bodies, and what euer else might make them odious to the ignorant multitude. By the Iewes they were called in contempt <HI>Nazari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s</HI> by <HI>Iulian</HI> scornfully they were termed <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">lilaeans;</HI> by <HI>Ulpian</HI> vnder <HI>Seuerus impostores,</HI> as if they had beene coggers and deceiuers; by <HI>Demetrian</HI> whom <HI>Cyprian</HI>
<PB REF="8">
confuted, procurers of all the plagues of God that came vpon the world. Yea, so farre in their ignorant malice did they proceede, that it was counted a capi|tall crime for any man to call himselfe a Christian. A most vnreasonable thing indeede, seeing as <HI>Tertullian</HI> reasons in his <HI>Apologet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">&abque;</HI> written in defence of Chri|stians. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> nominis nullus est rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tertull. Apologet.</NOTE></P>
<P>But now Sathan hath changed his course: for per|ceiuing that doe what he can, Christianity flourishes like vnto the Palme tree, which growes the more, the more it is prest downe, hee labours subtilly to staine and obscure the glory of that holy profession, which before by cruelty hee could not ouerthrow: for now the Christian name is become common, and men of most licentious life are brought vnder the couering thereof; by which policie of Sathan, men are put into this false opinion, that it is an easie thing to be a Christian, and that a man may liue as hee likes, and be a Christian good enough also: whereof it is come to passe, that the Church is re|plenished, with such a number of bastards, and coun|terfeit Christians, as this day we may see with griefe of heart, some Atheists, some Apostates, some adul|terers, many murtherers, most part blasphemers: <HI>qui Christianum nomen ad <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">dicium habent, non ad re|medium.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. de Temp. 215.</NOTE> And vnder this generall opinion of Chri|stianity liueth now many a one miserably deceiued, <HI>impugnant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s eum quem praedicant,</HI> either persecuting<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gregor. mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">. lib. 1.</NOTE> the sonne of God by damnable doctrine, or else by their workes denying him, while they professe that they know him; turning the grace of God into wan|tonnesse; hauing a name, that they are aliue, but in truth are dead.</P>
<P>It is certainly a great pitie to see so many of <HI>Adams</HI>
<PB REF="8">
sonnes, in word condemners of their Fathers Apo|stasie; yet indeed imitators of his folly, hiding their nakednesse with a garment of Fig-tree leaues; not perceiuing how by so doing, they come neere to the likenesse of that Tree, which had faire leaues, but no fruit, and therefore was once accursed by Iesus Christ, that it might stand a perpetuall example of that fear|full curse, which these men may looke for at his hands, who haue a shew of godlinesse, but hath de|nied the power thereof, and are outwardly like vnto painted Scpulchres, beautifull to the eye of man, but in his sight who searches the heart, are full of rotten|nesse, and all filthinesse; whereas indeede they should be the Temples of the liuing God, far more glorious and beautiful within then without. <HI>Iacobs</HI> heart vnder <HI>Esau</HI> his garment, were farre more seemely for them who say they are <HI>Iacobs</HI> brethren, then to haue <HI>Iacobs</HI> voice onely, that is, a tongue to speake well, and yet the prophane heart with the rough and cruell hands of <HI>Esau,</HI> which sort of disguised Christians may look not for such a fauorable successe of their dissembling with God as <HI>Iacob</HI> found with <HI>Isaac.</HI> For he being but a man, was deceiued through ignorance, but men de|ceiue themselues, if they thinke that in this manner God can be mocked, what euer shape men turn them|selues into, the Lord can discern the Israelite in whom there is no guile, and though <HI>Simon Magus</HI> would seeme so religious, as to redeeme the graces of the spi|rit with the losse of his money, yet can the Spirit of God paint him out in his colours, and giue him his owne name, <HI>Thy heart is not vpright in the sight of God.</HI></P>
<P>Such is the power of godlinesse, that euen they who loue not the substance thereof, are forced often times to lurk vnder the shadow of it: and such again
<PB REF="9">
is the shame of sinne, that they who loue to commit it, yet doe not loue to seeme committers of it, <HI>hi sunt</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ber. in Cant. ser. 66.</NOTE> <HI>qui boni videri, non esse mal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> non videri, sed esse volunt,</HI> these are they who will seeme good, and not be so, will not seeme euill, and yet will be so To these we may speake as <HI>Chrysostome</HI> did to the like in his time. <HI>Dic hypocri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">a, si bonum est bonum esse, cur non vis esse,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chrisost. in Math.</NOTE> <HI>quod vis apparere, quod autem <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">urpe est apparere, turpi|us est esse?</HI> Tel me hypocrite, if it be a good thing to be good, why wilt thou not be that which thou wouldst appeare to be, for that which is a shame for a man to appeare to be, is it not much more shame for him to be it indeede? <HI>aut ergo esto quod appares, aut appare, quod es,</HI> either else therefore be such, as thou ap|pearest, or then appeare such as thou art.</P>
<P>It were happy for these men, if they could learne in time to examine themselues according to that word, by which one day they will be iudged, for not euery one that saith Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdome of God, <HI>He is not a Iew, that is one without,</HI> neither hath <HI>euery one receiued an ointment from that holy one:</HI> but he who is a Christian indeede, <HI>sicut par|ticeps</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ber. in <HI>Cant.</HI> ser. 15.</NOTE> <HI>est nominis, it a &amp; haereditatis,</HI> with the name of Christ, the oyle of grace from Christ is also commu|nicated to him, by which with Christ he is pertaker of the inheritance. <HI>Qui vero Christum i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">se non ha|bet,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. de Temp. ser. 17</NOTE> <HI>Christianus dici non potest,</HI> but hee that hath not Christ liuing in him by his spirit, cannot be called a Christian. It is a notable saying of <HI>Basile, quid inquit est Christianimus?</HI> what said hee is Christianity? <HI>si|militudo</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Basil. hexa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> hom. 10.</NOTE> <HI>Dei quoad eius capax est Natura humana,</HI> a similitude and conformity with God, so farre forth, as the nature of man is capable thereof.</P>
<P>Seeing then it is the doing, not the speaking of
<PB REF="9">
righteousnesse, must proue vs to be the children of God, <HI>For if wee say wee haue fellowship with God, and walke in darknes, we lie, and do not truly,</HI> and <HI>if any man be in Christ Iesus he must become a new creature,</HI> let vs studie to proue our new generation by our new man|ners, conforming our selues to the rule of a Christian conuersation. A patterne and example whereof I haue gathered out of holy Scripture, and proposed vnto thee, wherein thou shalt see first how the Chri|stian who by his first birth was borne a Naturall man, by his second becomes a Christian, with such other things as with his new birth he receiues to make him a new man. Secondly, what is the disposition of his inward man, by which hee walkes with God. And thirdly, the disposition of his outward man, by which he walkes among men, and that in all the points of his conuersation both inward and outward. Euery one whereof as ye haue them set downe particularly in seuerall Chapters, so doth euery Chapter consist of these foure things. First, Gods precept to the Christian: secondly, the Christians prayer to God: thirdly, his practise of both: and these three haue you set downe in words of holy Scripture alanerly. The fourth is, in the end of euery Chapter some ob|seruations teaching vs how to make our owne profit of the words of God. This is the order I haue ob|serued here: for the Christian, because hee knowes that he is bound to liue to the Lord, and not to him|selfe, doth in all his waies set before him the com|mandements of his God. And next, because hee knowes his owne Naturall inability to fulfill these commandements, he turneth all the precepts of God into prayers, the vse whereof I hope in all the parts of thy life, shall not be vnprofitable for thee. And
<PB REF="10">
last of all, hee liues in a continuall practise of those du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ties of godlinesse which God in his word hath commanded him, and he himselfe doth pray for.</P>
<P>Now in the end I haue onely to obuiate two sorts of men: by the one it is surmized that I haue plowed with the Heifer of another, specially of <HI>Cashmannus,</HI> who hath written before me, <HI>de nouo homine:</HI> by the other it may be obiected that I haue presented an imperfect image of a Christian, and haue left out ma|ny things which profitably might haue beene poin|ted out concerning him. For the first, as I giue thanks to God for the labours of that worthy man: so if I had borrowed any thing from him, I would neuer thinke shame to confesse it: <HI>nam ingenui pudoris est, vt ait</HI> Plinius, <HI>fateri per quos profecerimus, &amp; haec quasi merces authori iure optimo pensitanda est, ne fures esse videamur:</HI> but the truth is, that many yeares before he came in this Country, this <HI>Anatomie</HI> was drawne and portraited, as now you see it. As for the second I humbly confesse it, <HI>Malim tamen aliquid agendo ma|iorem &agrave;me doctrinam, &amp; sapientiam desiderari, quam nihil agendo prudentior, doctior&abque; iudicari.</HI> It was a com|mendable policy of these Indian Philosophers, called <HI>Gymnosophista, qui &agrave; suis discipulis, seuerius otis, qu&agrave;m negoti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> rationem exigendam esse arbitrabantar.</HI> What I haue done in this little labour, is a part of my nego|tiation with that one talent I haue receiued from the Lord, and which hee hath charged me to put to the vttermost profit. And therefore had I rather by do|ing of some good, lay open my infirmities to the censure of men, then to hide by idlenesse my talent in the earth, and so to incurre the indignation of my Maister. I know my selfe I haue not done what I should, nay, not what by the grace of God I could,
<PB REF="10">
yet that which in regard of my daily labour in the worke of the Ministerie I might.</P>
<P>Accept therefore from me, this image of a Chri|stian in a Christian manner; apply it to thy selfe and looke what similitude or dissimilitude thou findest betweene thee and it. Doe as <HI>Elizeus</HI> did to the wid|dowes sonne, when he raised him from death to life, he stretched himselfe ouer the childe, hee put his mouth on the childes mouth, his eyes on his eyes, his hands on his hands, and therewithall he ioyned prayer, and the childe reuiued: so compare thou thy selfe with this ensample; thy minde, thy will, thy affections, thy words, thy actions with these of the new man: where thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">indest a conformity, giue thanks to God for the beginning of the worke of his grace in thee: where not, pray to God further to quicken thee, that thou mayest grow in an holy simi|litude and conformity with him, to the glory of his holy name, and thy euerlasting comfort in Christ Iesus, to whom be praise, glory, and honour for euer.</P>

<P>ELection is the first spring that flowes from the<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Our election is not knowne to vs be|fore our Regene|ration.</NOTE> bottomlesse fountaine of Gods loue, but for a long time it runnes so secret that we cannot see it, till it breake forth and appeare in our Regene|ration, or effectuall calling.</P>
<P>Regeneration is the first manifest effect of<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Regeneration is the first manifest effect of God his mercie toward man.</NOTE> Gods mercie toward a man: as wee could not be men, if we had not beene conceiued and borne; so can we not be Christian men, vnlesse we be borne againe. Therefore it is, that when <HI>Nicodemus</HI> a Master in Israel, was to be made a Disciple of Christ, the first Doctrine that our Sauiour taught him, was of Regeneration.</P>
<P>And it stands as a rule for all men in Christs<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 And the first lesson we must learne in Christs schoole.</NOTE> schoole, <HI>If any man will be my Disciple, let him denie himselfe.</HI> Now, both learned and vnlearned liue as if Christianitie consisted in speaking, and professing; but sure it is, <HI>the kingdome of God is not in word, but in power</HI> and <HI>practise,</HI> and
<PB N="6" REF="14">
he hath not learned Christ, who hath not learned to cast off the old man, who is corrupted through deceiueable lusts.</P>
<P>In the first generation wee were begotten<NOTE PLACE="marg">4 Our first generati|on and our second compared toge|ther.</NOTE> men by the will of fleshand blood, in the second we are begotten Christian men by the will of God. In the first, our mortall father begat vs to succeed him; in the second, our immortall father hath begotten vs for euer to abide with him. By the first, wee may say to corruption, thou art my<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob. 25. 6.</NOTE> father, and to the wormes, yee are my brethren and sisters: by the second, wee may say to God, thou art my father, and to Iesus Christ, elect An|gels, and holy men, ye are my brethren. For in the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ephes. 2.</NOTE> first, we were conceiued and borne in sinne, and consequently heires of wrath and eternall dam|nation; but in the second, we are the workeman|ship of God, created in Christ to good workes, and consequently heires of grace and glory.</P>
<P>If our first generation had beene good,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5 By nature we haue nothing in vs can profit vs to salua|tion.</NOTE> there had not needed a second. In naturall men, there are some remnants of Gods image, and some sparckles of light, by which they differ from beasts, and a fellowship is entertained a|mong men; but these cannot profit man to salua|tion, but rather makes him inexcusable, and en|creases his damnation. <HI>Vigens ratione, &amp; non vi|uens</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bern. in Cant.

into shame, because hee detaines and with-holds<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 1. 18.</NOTE> the truth in vnrighteousnes.</P>
<P>Our blessed Sauiour farre abaseth the pride<NOTE PLACE="marg">6 For in a naturall man there is no|thing but the blind leading the croo|ked.</NOTE> of nature, when hee saies that man cannot enter into Gods kingdome till he be borne againe. What euer the Semipelagians of our time say to magnifie the arme of flesh, and to diminish the praise of Christs grace; certaine it is, there is no|thing in man by nature, but the blind leading the crooked; that is, a blind mind leading a peruerse and crooked will: and so no maruell that both of them at length, if they be left vnto themselues, fall into perdition.</P>
<P>It is a pitie to heare sillie worldlings boa|sting<NOTE PLACE="marg">7 Nat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">lists boa|sting of the priui|ledges of their first birth, are to be pitied.</NOTE> of the priuiledges of their first birth, such as Nobilitie of blood, and ancietie of their inheri|tances, and are not humbled by considering that they are borne heires of Gods wrath, which they shall inherit for euer, when all the comforts of their earthly inheritances shall forsake them. Be what thou wilt, if thou haue no more then thou hast by thy first birth, it were better for thee thou hadst neuer beene borne, thou shalt curse for e|uer the loynes that begat thee, and the wombe that bare thee, and the pappes that gaue thee sucke, thou shalt curse the day wherin it was said of thee, A man is borne; and thy vaine tempo|rall gloriation, shall end in a sore eternall la|mentation.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="15"><HI>Nicodemus</HI> was somewhat excusable though<NOTE PLACE="marg">8 Ignorance of the doctrine of Rege|neration is now mexcusable.</NOTE> he vnderstood not the doctrine of regeneration, because he had neuer heard it before; but now, if we be ignorant of it, we are altogether inexcu|sable; both because it is so clearely taught vs in the word, and so necessarily required of vs, that without it we cannot, as saith our Sauiour, enter into the kingdome of God.</P>
<P>The names which regeneration receiues in<NOTE PLACE="marg">9 By what names Regeneration is expressed in holy Scripture.</NOTE> holy Scripture, may helpe vs some way to know it, if they be considered; for it is called sometime a new creation, sometime a new birth, sometime a renouation, and sometime a transformation. There are (saith <HI>Basil</HI>) two sorts of creation: <HI>vnum</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Basil. in Epist. 41. ad Caesar.</NOTE> <HI>eorum quae ex nihilo, cum non essent sunt condita<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> al|terum eorum, quae ex prioribus ad meliora immu|tantur:</HI> and of this last sort is Regeneration.</P>
<P>Of this, it is euident that Regeneration is a<NOTE PLACE="marg">10 What Regenerati|on is.</NOTE> mutation of the whole man, both soule and body from one thing to another; namely, from sinne to sanctification, from darkenesse to light, from death to life, from the power of Sathan to God, <HI>Act.</HI> 26. 18.</P>
<P>In euery mutation one thing remooues, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">11 Of the change made in Regene|ration.</NOTE> another succeeds. As in euery generation, <HI>vnius ortus est alterius interitus;</HI> so is it in this generati|on, that which dies is corrupted nature, called the Old man; that which is quickened, is renewed na|ture, called the New man: hee who hath rightly
<PB N="9" REF="15">
learned Christ, <HI>cast, off, concerning the conuersati|on</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ephes. 4. 22.</NOTE> <HI>in time past, the old man, which is corrupt tho|rough deceiueable lusts, and put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousnesse and true holinesse. Oportet enim eum qui alteram vi|tam</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Basil. de Sancto. cap. 15.</NOTE> <HI>incepturus est priori finem imponere.</HI></P>
<P>The Regeneration then of the soule hath two<NOTE PLACE="marg">12 Regeneration of the Soule consists in two.</NOTE> partes; the first is, the mortification of the old man, called also the circumcision of the heart, and the crucifixion of the flesh: the second, the<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 The first is morti|fication of the old man.</NOTE> vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ification of the new man, called also the first resurrection.</P>
<P>Corrupted nature is called the old man for<NOTE PLACE="marg">13 Corrupted nature compared to an old man for three causes.</NOTE> three causes; first, because it is almost as old as our nature: for it began in <HI>Adam,</HI> soone after his creation. Secondly, it is called the old man, in respect of the new man arising to succeed in his roome, to the possession of soule and bodie, which before we possessed by him. And thirdly, because in the godly this corruption waxeth weake and infirme, wearing daily neerer and neerer to death, after the manner of old men.</P>
<P>But it is to be marked, that in these two last<NOTE PLACE="marg">14 Sinfull nature is neuer old in the wicked.</NOTE> respects, sinfull corruption of nature is named the old man, in men regenerate onely, and in no other; for in men vnregenerate, their corruption shall for euer possesse them, it increases vpon them, and is yong, strong, and liuely, euen when they themselues are weake, and wearing to the graue.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="16">Now, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> no birth can be without sorrow, nor<NOTE PLACE="marg">15 Regeneration can|not be without spirituall paine and dolour.</NOTE> death without dolour, nor circumcision, or cut|ting of the flesh, without paine; so cannot our re|generation be wrought without godly sorrow, and anguish of spirit: which I marke for the comfort of the godly, that they may know that sanctified troubles of conscience, are but the do|lours of the new birth, and therefore should not be discouraged with them.</P>
<P>The infant that hath lien but nine moneths<NOTE PLACE="marg">16 Sathan a great troubler of vs in the worke of our Regeneration.</NOTE> in the mothers wombe, cannot throng out in|to the world without paine; and thinkest thou to be lighter of sinne, wherein thou wast concei|ued and borne, and which also hath beene so many yeares nourished in thy bowels without paine? As <HI>Pharaoh</HI> grieued Israel forest, when they stroue fastest to libertie; and as that dumb spirit tormented that yong man worst, when he saw he was to be cast out of him, <HI>Mark.</HI> 9. 25. So Sathan troubles the godly most heauily, when hee sees the time of their deliuerance from his seruitude and bondage neerest.</P>
<P>But our comfort is, that God is faithfull, as he begins the worke, so will he finish and end it:<NOTE PLACE="marg">17 But he fights in vaine, for God wil finish it.</NOTE> Strong is Sathan indeed, but Christ our Lord is that <HI>stronger one. Pharaoh</HI> may repine, but hee shall perish, and the Israelites of God shall goe<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 11. 22.</NOTE> through; that vncleane spirit in our parting from him may rend vs, and cast vs as dead men to the
<PB N="11" REF="16">
ground, but out shall he goe, and Christ by his hand shall raise vs vp againe.</P>
<P>The other part of the Regeneration of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">18</NOTE> Soule is called, as I said, the viuification of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 The second is viui|fication of the new man.</NOTE> new man, and the first resurrection, where in our heauenly father communicates to vs his owne seed, 1. <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. his nature, 2. <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 4. and his image, 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 3. 18. For since earthly fathers beget crea|tures like vnto themselues, shall wee thinke that the heauenly father begets children to another similitude, not his owne? Surely they doe great|ly dishonour the Lord, who in their words say they are the sonnes of God, and yet in their a|ctions resemble the image of Sathan.</P>
<P>The Regeneration againe of the body con|sists<NOTE PLACE="marg">19 Regeneration of the body consists in two.</NOTE> also in two; first, in a right vsing of the members of our body, as weapons of righteous|nesse to serue God, which we are taught to doe by grace: Next, in a full deliuerance of them from mortalitie and corruption.</P>
<P>Of this, it is cleare that the Regeneration of<NOTE PLACE="marg">20 Regeneration will not be perfected til the resurrection.</NOTE> the whole man will not be perfected till the day of resurrection, called for that cause by our Sa|uiour, the Regeneration, <HI>Matth.</HI> 19. 28. Now, through grace the Soule liues a happy life in the body, thogh not as yet fully clensed and separa|ted fro~ sin. Out of the body it liues a more happy life: being freed from all sin; but yet not conten|ted, for the soule was not made to liue by it self,
<PB N="12" REF="17">
but in the body, and therefore cannot rest con|tented, so long as it wants his owne organe and companion; but when the body shall be raised againe, and soule &amp; body revnited, both of them fully deliuered from sinne, and from the fruits of sinne, then shall our generation which now is begun, be perfected and absolued.</P>
<P>As for our parents in this generation, wee<NOTE PLACE="marg">21 Of our parents in the new generation</NOTE> haue God for our Father in Christ, and Ierusa|lem, which is from aboue, to wit, the Church of Christ, the mother of vs all. The Apostle to the Corinthians calles himselfe their Father; <HI>Though ye haue ten thousand instructers, yet haue ye not many fathers, for in Christ Iesus I haue be|gotten you, through the Gospel,</HI> 1. Cor. 4. 15. And againe to the Galathians, hee calles himselfe their mother; <HI>My little children, of whom I tra|uaile in birth againe, till Christ be formed in you,</HI> Gal. 4. 19. But Preachers are onely ministeriall parents, ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> for this same should they be ho|noured of people as their fathers, and should a|gaine carrie toward their people no lesse affe|ction then fathers haue to their children, speci|ally to procure their euerlasting saluation.</P>
<P>But here both the naturall mother is to bee<NOTE PLACE="marg">22 The naturall mo|ther discerned from the stepmother.</NOTE> discerned from the stepmother, and the ba|stard children from the lawfull; for the chast spouse of Christ will receiue no seed into her bosom, but the seed of her immortall husband,

<P>And therefore the Church of Rome, which<NOTE PLACE="marg">23 The Church of Rome a strumpet and a stepmother.</NOTE> withdrawes these pappes from the mouthes of Gods children, or giues them the milke of the word, mingled with the Traditions of men, pre|tend what shee will, is but a strumpet and step|mother.</P>
<P>And as there is a stepmother, so is there also<NOTE PLACE="marg">24 The lawful and kindly sonnes of God, discerned from the bastard.</NOTE> bastard children, they sit vpon the knee of Christs spouse, but neuer sucked her pappes, to draw life and grace out of her breasts: such a one was <HI>Cham</HI> in the Arke, such was <HI>Ismael</HI> in <HI>Abrahams</HI> house, such was <HI>Esau</HI> brought vp with <HI>Iacob</HI> on the knee of <HI>Rebecca:</HI> and alas, such are many in our time, who in regard of profession are in Gods Church, pretending they are sons, but are in very deed bastards, no way in their life resembling the image of their heauenly father.</P>

For it is the new Sense which cau|ses the heart to moue and stirre in a new man|ner. Therefore is it, that first wee will speake of the Christians Senses, and then of his motion or disposition.</P>
<P>Naturall parents often times bring out their<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 No imperfect nor mutilate children borne by the new generation.</NOTE> children either dead, or wanting some Sense, or mutilate of some member; but in the new gene|ration it is not so, for the Lord begets no dead, no senselesse, no imperfect children, but liuing, indued with all their Senses, and perfect in re|gard of the number of their parts.</P>
<P>The first Sense by regeneration restored to<NOTE PLACE="marg">4 The first Sense re|stored in Regene|ration is Hearing.</NOTE> the Children of God, is the Sense of Hearing. As the eare was the first port by which death was

<P>It is the order appointed by God, that wee<NOTE PLACE="marg">6 For by hearing our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ies are cured, and prepared to see God.</NOTE> should heare him before we come to see him: <HI>Auditus aspectum restituet,</HI> we lost our sight by transgression of Gods word, we get it againe by obedient hearing thereof. <HI>Sanet itaq&uacute;e auditus</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bern. in Cant. serm. 48.</NOTE> <HI>oculum, qui turbatus est, vt serenus vi leat, quem turbatus non potuit.</HI> Let vs therefore by hea|ring learne how to cure our eye, that the eye be|ing made cleare, may see the Lord, whom it can|not see, so long as it is troubled; then shall wee sing, <HI>As we haue heard, so haue wee seene, in the</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 48. 8.</NOTE> <HI>citie of the Lord of Hoasts.</HI></P>

A iust punishment of mans rebellion, if hee will not heare when God speakes, God shall not heare when he prayes, and shall neuer admit him to see his face in heauen.</P>
<P>But the eares required in the Christian are<NOTE PLACE="marg">8 Eares of the man regenerate are in|ternall.</NOTE> internall, by which he may heare what the spi|rit saith.

<P>And they who haue receiued these eares doe<NOTE PLACE="marg">9 How the internal eares are knowne by sanctification.</NOTE> heare in such sort, that they are sanctified by hearing according to that of our blessed Saui|our, <HI>Now are ye cleane through the word which I</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 15. 3.</NOTE> <HI>haue spoken to you.</HI> But alas, how great is the number of them, who after so long a hearing of the Gospel, doe still retaine the filthinesse of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iam. 1. 22.</NOTE> their old sinnes? they are <HI>hearers onely, and not</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">10 Carnall hearers of the word discoue|red.</NOTE> <HI>doers of the word, deceiuing themselues:</HI> for either

else when they heare the word, they vnderstand it not; or if they vnderstand it, they are not mo|ued with it; or if they be mooued, they are not mended by it, their motion beeing but like that of <HI>Foelix,</HI> and their repentance like vnto the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 24. 26.</NOTE> morning dew; but few they are, whose ears God hath opened by the grace of Regeneration.</P>
<P>The second Sense we receiue in the Regene|ration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11</NOTE> is the Sense of Seeing. Sathan promised<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 The second Sense we receiue in Re|generation is Seeing.</NOTE> to our parents, that if they would eat of the for|bidden tree, they should become like God in knowledge; but like a false deceiuer as he is, hee made them like vnto himselfe: for the know|ledge of good, which they had by creation, in|stantly they lost it by their transgression, and learned by experience that euill which before they knew not; for their eies were opened to see their nakednesse, and they were ashamed of it.</P>
<P>The eye of the body was made to behold the<NOTE PLACE="marg">12 As a troubled eye cannot behold the light, so a wounded conscience dare not looke to the Lord.</NOTE> light, that by it wee might see the rest of the creatures, and in them the goodnesse of the Creator; but if the eye be hurt and wounded, <HI>non solum auertit se a luce, sed etiam poenalis illi sit lux,</HI> It doth not onely turne away from behol|ding the light, but the light also, which other|wise is delightfull, becomes painefull to it. <HI>Sic &amp; oculus cordis perturbatus &amp; sauciatus auer|tit se &agrave; iustitiae lumine, nec audet eam contemplari nec valet.</HI> So the eye of the soule being hurt
<PB N="21" REF="21">
and troubled, turnes it selfe away from the light of righteousnesse, neither dare it, neither can it behold it.</P>
<P>An example whereof we may see in our first<NOTE PLACE="marg">13 An example hereof proposed in <HI>Adam.</HI></NOTE> father <HI>Adam,</HI> who reioyced at the presence of God, so long as he kept a good conscience; but from the time the eye of his soule was wounded with transgression, he ran away from God, hee could not see the Lord as he was woont to doe, but was afraid to heare him. So cursed and consuming a canker is sin, that it changes our sweetest comforts, and makes them becom bit|ter terrors vnto vs.</P>
<P>But this sight which wee lost by the sinne of<NOTE PLACE="marg">14 Sight lost by <HI>Adam</HI> restored by Christ.</NOTE> <HI>Adam,</HI> is restored againe vnto vs by the grace of Christ, who annoynts our eyes with eye salue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reuel. 3.</NOTE> by which we are made to see, and discerne things that are excellent: in a word, he indues vs with the gift of faith, by which we haue fel|lowship with God, so that we dare in assurance draw neere the throne of his grace.</P>
<P>Now the eyes of Christs spouse are two; by<NOTE PLACE="marg">15 The eyes of a Christian are two.</NOTE> the one we know our miserie, which causeth vs denie our selues: by the other we know his mer|cies,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Adam</HI> knew his miserie before he was restored by grace, but we can|not doe so, and why?</NOTE> which causeth vs to runne vnto him. Apo|state <HI>Adam</HI> before his restitution by grace, had his eyes opened to know his miserie; for the knowledge of that good which hee had in the estate of innocencie, made him incontinent
<PB N="22" REF="22">
sensible of that euill, into which he had fallen by his Apostacie. But now man cannot know his miserie, till by the grace of Regeneration his eyes be opened; for till that be, he knowes no other estate, but the estate of sinne, wherein hee was conceiued, borne, and brought vp, and which in his darkened cogitation hee esteemes to be good enough, vntill such time he be tran|slated into a better.</P>
<P>Sight once receiued should be diligent|ly<NOTE PLACE="marg">15 Sight restored should be diligent|ly conserued.</NOTE> conserued, for as the eye of the body is very tender, and easily offended, for which cause God hath guarded it with liddes which close and open most speedily at the pleasure of man; so is it with the eye of the mind, and there|fore the good that may preserue it should be much esteemed, and the euill that may hurt it carefully eschewed.</P>
<P>Three things are required for the help of<NOTE PLACE="marg">16 Three things help|full to spirituall sight.</NOTE> those spirituall eyes, by which the Lord is seene: first, that wee haue another light beside the light of our owne vnderstanding; for <HI>sicut Sol si|ne</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">First, that Gods light illuminate our vnderstan|ding.</NOTE> <HI>Sole non videtur, ita nec Deus sine deo videri potest:</HI> as the eye albeit it were neuer so cleare, yet can it not see without the light of the sunne; so our vnderstanding though it were neuer so quicke, cannot attaine to know the Lord, vnlesse that he by his owne light reueale himselfe vnto vs in his word. And therefore is it that the most
<PB N="23" REF="22">
wise Naturalists being destitute of this light, had<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 1.</NOTE> their foolish hearts ful of darkenes, and became vaine in their owne imaginations.</P>
<P>The second thing required is, that we haue<NOTE PLACE="marg">17 Secondly, that wee haue some confor|mitie with God in holinesse.</NOTE> some conformitie with God in holinesse; for as no member in the body can perceiue the light of the sunne, but the eye, by reason of a simili|tude which is betweene them, both of them be|ing appointed vessels and organes of light, the one in the great, the other in the little world; so can no man see the Lord, except in some measure he be like him: <HI>Blessed are the pure in</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. 5. 8. Heb. 12. 14.</NOTE> <HI>spirit, for they shall see him, but without peace and sanctification no man can see the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>The third thing required, is attention: for e|uen<NOTE PLACE="marg">18 Thirdly, that the heart be stablished by attention and consideration.</NOTE> as a tumbling and rowling eye seeth not those things which are before it; so a wandring mind not stablished by consideration and di|uine contemplation, cannot see the Lord.</P>
<P>The bodily sight is two manner of waies<NOTE PLACE="marg">19 Sight two manner of waies offended.</NOTE> offended, either by exterior dust cast into it, or by interior humors stopping the opticke nerues within; so Sathan either casteth into our eyes the dongue of the world, to blind vs by it; or then by our owne grosse and carnall affections stops the conduits of our sight, that wee should not see the Lord: and therefore both the one and the other should carefully be eschewed.</P>
<P>If the eye be once offended with the smallest
<PB N="24" REF="23">
mote, we delay not to remedie it, but doe im|plore<NOTE PLACE="marg">20 The sight offen|ded should be cu|red without delay.</NOTE> the help of such as are neerest vs to take it out. Since by nature we are so carefull to keep the eye, by which we see the sunne, how carefull should we be to conserue the eye, by which we see him who made the sunne.</P>
<P>The third Sense restored in the Regenera|tion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">21 The third Sense restored in regene|ration is Smelling.</NOTE> is Smelling. All the garments of our Bride|groome smell of Myrrhe and Cassia, but the virgins onely feele the sauour of his oyntments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 45. Cant. 1.</NOTE> for which they runne after him, they smell in the Gospel the sauour of life; and therefore as the Eagle smelling the carrion a farre off, re|sorts vnto it; so the Christian senting liuely in the word of Christ Iesus, slees speedily after him, ascending after him in his affection, there where hee is, to wit, at the right hand of God in heauen.</P>
<P>But miserable are the wicked, for they sauour<NOTE PLACE="marg">22 To the naturall man nothing sa|uours well but dongue.</NOTE> onely those things which are after the flesh, like those vncleane beasts in the Law, which creep with all their foure vpon earth, senting no|thing but dongue, the puddle being more plea|sant to such filthy swine then the pearle. Woe be to them, for euen in the Gospel of grace they smell no other thing but the sauour of death.</P>
<P>The fourth is the Sense of Tasting, by which the Christian so tastes the sweetnesse of Gods
<PB N="25" REF="23">
mercy &amp; the sauing grace of Christ in the Go|spell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23 The fourth sense restored in regene|ration is tasting.</NOTE> that it descends into his bowels to nourish him, and make him grow in godlinesse: where as the wicked, if at any time they taste thereof, yet they neuer digest it, the corruption of their nature being so strong in them, that it suffocates and choakes the seede of the word, so that it profits them not to saluation.</P>
<P>And the last is the sense of touching, which<NOTE PLACE="marg">24 The sift sense is touching.</NOTE> in effect is done by beleeuing, for, <HI>tangere Chri|stum est credere in Christum,</HI> like as the rest of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. in Ioan. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ract, 16.</NOTE> the senses are comprised in faith, that iustifies a supernaturall gift, which <HI>Adam</HI> in his innocen|cie had not, but in Christ is giuen vs, a most<NOTE PLACE="marg">How all these sen|ses are comprehen|ded in faith.</NOTE> ample gift, for it not onely makes all things our owne in Christ, but makes vs all manner of waies to enioy Christ, it being most certaine, that by faith wee heare him, and discerne his voice, by faith we see him, by faith wee smell him, by faith we taste his sauing grace, and by faith we so touch him, that we draw vertue out of him.</P>
<P>In Nature, that which is the obiect of one<NOTE PLACE="marg">25 In the Christian the obiect of one sense, is the obiect of all.</NOTE> sense, is not alway the obiect of another, as for example: a voice is heard by the eare, but is not seene by the eie, but in the Christian rene|wed by grace, that which is the obiect of any one sense, is also perceiued by all the rest.</P>
<P>And herein hath the Lord made his aboundant
<PB N="26" REF="24">
loue manifest vnto man; for looke what manner<NOTE PLACE="marg">26 Gods great good|nesse, who by all possible waies com|municates himselfe vnto man.</NOTE> of waies a man may enioy any thing that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> good, all those waies doth God communicate himselfe to man, some good things we enioy by seeing, and some by hearing, and some by ta|sting; but the Lord not content to communi|cate himselfe vnto vs by hearing, doth also call vs to see him, to smell him, to taste him, to touch him, that so all manner of waies we may enioy him: euerlasting praise therefore be vnto him.</P>
<P>Againe, wee see that as in nature those things<NOTE PLACE="marg">27 No speech can giue vnderstanding, where sense is wan|ting.</NOTE> which are learned by Sense, cannot be vnder|stood of him who is destitute of Sense; what a|uailes it to teach the harmonie of Musicke to him that is without eares? or to discourse of the comfortable light of the Sunne to him that is without eies? Can any eloquence so well ex|presse the sweetnesse of hony, as it is felt by ta|sting?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Basil. exhort. ad Bapti.</NOTE> <HI>Sensus enim omni sermone est efficacior.</HI> But it is more impossible that they who are de|stitute of these new and spirituall Senses should vnderstand those things which concerne the spirituall life.</P>
<P>Pitifull then is the ignorance of Naturalists,<NOTE PLACE="marg">28 As the beast know|eth not the life of the man naturall: so the naturall man knoweth not the excellent life of the Christian.</NOTE> euen of them who seeme to the world to be most wise; for surely, as the bruit beast vnder|stands nothing of the naturall life of man, and knowes not how farre it excels that sensitiue life
<PB N="27" REF="24">
by which it liues, and therfore desires not a bet|ter, because it knowes no better; so the naturall man knowes nothing of the excellencie of that spirituall life, which the Christian hath begun to liue here, and by which he shall liue for euer hereafter: and therefore being delighted with his owne miserable life, hath not so much as a desire of a better.</P>

<P>VVHat the inclination of a childe is, can|not<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 The Christians growth why en|treated of in this place.</NOTE> well be knowne in his infancie, but with time as he growes, his disposition is more and more manifested, therefore doe wee first speake of the Christians growth, before wee come to speake of his manners.</P>
<P>Growth in grace and godlinesse, is an inse|perable<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Growth an insepe|rable consequent of life.</NOTE> consequent of spirituall life. <HI>Elijah</HI> fed by God, walked in the strength of that bread forty dayes: but the Christian being nouri|shed, as is said before, doth walke all his dayes in the strength thereof, making a daily pro|gresse in godlinesse, till at last he become a per|fect man.</P>
<P>The blessing pronounced by the Lord vpon<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 Gods blessing both in the first and se|cond creation, is neuer ineffectuall.</NOTE> man in the first creation, was this, <HI>Encrease and multiply:</HI> and the blessing pronounced vpon man in the second creation, is this, <HI>Grow in</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Esa. 61. 3. 11</NOTE> <HI>grace and knowledge.</HI> The Christians being as trees of righteousnes, and planting of the Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is not blessed of God, that growes not in godlinesse.</NOTE> in whom he will cause righteousnesse to grow for his owne glory. Seeing we see that the first
<PB N="40" REF="31">
stands effectuall vnto this day, shall we thinke that the second can be ineffectuall? No indeed, he is not blessed of the Lord, who growes not in grace.</P>
<P>For it is promised vnder Christs kingdome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4 For growth is a grace promised vn|der the kingdome of Christ.</NOTE> <HI>Esa,</HI> 55. 13. that the Firre should grow in place of the thorne, and the Myrrhe tree should grow in place of the Nettle, that is, the seede of grace should spring vp in that heart, wherein the root of bitternesse had budded before. And except we finde this change wrought in vs, we cannot as yet say that we are translated into the king|dome of Christ.</P>
<P>The growth of a Christian is expressed in ho|ly<NOTE PLACE="marg">5 The growth of a Christian compa|red to the growth of a childe vnto an olde man.</NOTE> Scripture by sundry similitudes: first hee is compared to a childe that growes till hee be|come a man. It is thought strange to see a man of many yeares, who yet in stature, strength, and wit, went neuer beyond the measure of a childe, such a one is counted for a monster, and truly no better is the carelesse Christian, who after so many yeares profession, growes not in grace nor knowledge, but still remaines a childe in vnderstanding.</P>
<P>Secondly, he is compared to a trauailer that<NOTE PLACE="marg">6 Compared second|ly to the pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">sse made by a trauai|ler.</NOTE> bides not alway in one place, but euery day cuts off some peece of his way, which he leaues be|hinde him, and drawes daily neerer and neerer to the end proposed to him, and at last comes
<PB N="41" REF="31">
to it: so the Christian forgetting that which is behinde, endeuors himselfe to that which is before, following hard towards the marke, for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Iesus. <HI>Phil.</HI> 3. 13.</P>
<P>But the wicked, <HI>ambulant in circuitu,</HI> they still<NOTE PLACE="marg">7 The miserable ser|uitude of the wic|ked, in which they labour continually without making ei|ther progresse or profit.</NOTE> goe on in a compasse, walking round about in the circle of their sinnes, from one to another, and returning backe againe to the same, like the blinded horse, who labours and drawes a|bout the Mill continually, but at euening is in the same place, wherein he was in the morning. So they being borne in sinne, goe about in sin, like blinded captiues of Sathan, hauing no o|ther refreshment, but to exchange one sinne with another, and at last they die in their sinnes, for whom it had beene good that they had ne|uer beene borne.</P>
<P>Thirdly, his growth is compared to the<NOTE PLACE="marg">8 The growth of a Christian compa|red thirdly to the growth of a tree.</NOTE> growth of a tree, which being planted by the riuers of waters, hath abundance of moisture and sappe, and bringeth out fruit continually, <HI>Psal.</HI> 1. specially to the Palme tree, which all seasons of the yeare is both flowrishing and fruitfull, as Naturalists write of it.</P>
<P>Fourthly, it is expressed by the growth of<NOTE PLACE="marg">9 Compared fourth|ly to the growth of cornes in the fields.</NOTE> Cornes in the fields, which as saith our Saui|our: <HI>Mark.</HI> 4. first, spring vp to the blade: se|condly, haue eares; and then bring out ripe
<PB N="42" REF="32">
cornes, so doth the Christian by degrees grow to his perfection.</P>
<P>And fiftly the Christians grouth is expressed<NOTE PLACE="marg">10 Compared fiftly to the rising of the Sunne till the noon day.</NOTE> by the rising and ascending of the Sunne, which encreaseth and shineth more and more to the noone-tide of the day. For as for a declining time, or an euening, wherein his light should die out, the Christian by the grace of God shall ne|uer know it, for he that illuminateth him is that bright and excellent <HI>Sunne of righteousnesse,</HI> who is euer gloriously rising, and neuer declining nor going downe.</P>
<P>Last of all, hee is compared to a burning<NOTE PLACE="marg">11 And last to the light of the golden candlesticke conti|nually supplyed by Oyle.</NOTE> Lampe, <HI>Luke</HI> 12. or to that golden candlestick whereunto through the seauen pipes of gold, Oyle is carried continually from the two Oliues that stand before the ruler of the world, <HI>Zach.</HI> 4 2. whereof it comes to passe, that his light can<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zach. 4. 2.</NOTE> neuer faile.</P>
<P>Which yet is not so to be vnderstood as<NOTE PLACE="marg">12 This is not so to be vnderstood as if the Christian were not subiect to falles and diseases.</NOTE> though the Christian were not subiect to his owne fainting, falling, and dwining diseases, for he hath his owne Winter and Summer, falling and rising, decaying and renewing. But it is sure that by these same temporall falles and decayes his grouth is the more aduanced, in as much as they worke in him a greater hatred of his sinnefull corruption, and a more earnest desire of Grace, by which he may stand. <HI>Minime vero</HI>

<P>Yet is it not possible that he can vtterly de|cay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">13 Yet is it not possi|ble that the Chri|stian can fal finally.</NOTE> and finally fall away, and that because hee beares not the root, but the root beares him.

<P>Surely as the fall of the leafe is a token of<NOTE PLACE="marg">15 Falling away of the wicked foreshewes a Winter of Wrath to come vpon them</NOTE> Winter approaching: so the falling away of the wicked in this life, is a foretoken of that end|lesse winter of fearefull wrath, which from God is to come vpon them.</P>

This garment both couers and cures our filthy nakednes: it turnes our sicknes into health: our darknesse into light: for whosoeuer puts on the Lord Iesus for his righteousnesse to iustifica|tion, puts him on also for holinesse to sanctifi|cation; so full of Grace and Vertue is the Lord Iesus, that not onely by the merit of his suffe|rings doth hee pacifie the wrath of God towards all them in whom hee is, but also by his vertue sanctifieth them, by creating a new minde and a new heart in them, hee maketh them new creatures.</P>
<P>The third is, a suite of complete armour, most<NOTE PLACE="marg">12 This garment of holinesse cannot be kept without the whole complete armour.</NOTE> necessarie for the Christian, for Sathan enuying this new happinesse of man, endeuours continu|ally to defile, or rent in pieces our garment of holinesse: sometime hee assaults our Patience: sometime our Temperance, &amp;c. so that it is not possible for the Christian to keepe vnviolated the seuerall pieces of his holy garment, vnlesse hee put on the whole complete armour of God.</P>

<P>For in the bodily war-fare, men common|ly<NOTE PLACE="marg">14 Wee must not sight with our enemies by such armour as they vse against vs.</NOTE> doe resist their aduersaries by such weapons as their enemies doe impugne them with all: but in the spirituall, if wee sight against Sa|than in his Instruments, with such weapons as they vse in sighting against vs, the aduersarie shall easily ouercome vs.</P>

<P>That is, wee must not render euill for euill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">16 So must we ouer|come euill in the wicked by good.</NOTE> nor rebuke for rebuke; but if our enemies curse vs, let vs blesse them; if they persecute vs, let vs pray for them, that so we may ouercome euill with good.</P>

<P>But this naturall ignorance is remoued in<NOTE PLACE="marg">9 Light created in the minde by de|grees.</NOTE> the regeneration, and a holy light created in the minde of man, which the Lord workes by de|grees, as hee opened the eyes of that blind man<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 9. 29.</NOTE> by degrees.</P>
<P>And this light as it increaseth in the minde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">10 Euery knowledge doth not sanctifie.</NOTE> hath alwaies following it holinesse and humili|tie; not that euery knowledge doth sanctifie and humble him that hath it: for albeit the Lord il|luminateth euery one that comes into the world yet doth hee not sanctifie euery one; yea, there is knowledge in many which doth not hum|ble but puffe vp; not conuert, but conuince.</P>
<P>The Gentiles were endued with great know|ledge<NOTE PLACE="marg">11 Gentiles and car|nall Christians shut vp the light in the prison of their vnrighteousnesse.</NOTE> of God the Creator, by the light of Na|ture, but they with-held it in vnrighteousnesse, to their iuster condemnation: the bastard Chri|stians of our time, are endued also with the knowledge of God the Redeemer, by the light of the word, but it is likewise shut vp in the prison of their inordinate affections.</P>

<P>But this liuely knowledge created in our<NOTE PLACE="marg">13 Liuely knowledge workes humilitie, and banisheth a three-fold pride.</NOTE> mindes by God in the regeneration, doth work in vs both humilitie and holinesse: For first it banisheth out of our mind that threefold natu|rall pride which is in it, to wit, Blinde pride, Foolish pride, and Vaine pride.</P>
<P>Blinde pride, is when <HI>decepta &amp; deceptrix co|gitatio,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">14 Blinde Pride.</NOTE> the deceiuing and deceiued cogitation of mans minde makes him to thinke hee is far better then indeed hee is; and this may be seene in many, who are proud without any cause at all.<NOTE PLACE="marg">15 Foolish Pride.</NOTE></P>
<P>Foolish pride, is when a man is puft vp with that which he hath, as if it were his owne; this is, as if the Axe should take to it selfe the praise of hewing, or the Pen should vsurpe the praise of writing or the Wall should waxe proud be|cause the Sunne shines vpon it: so is it with the man who waxeth proud because God hath loo|ked vpon him, and doth any notable worke by him.</P>
<P>Vaine Pride, is when a man is puft vp with<NOTE PLACE="marg">16 Vaine Pride.</NOTE> that which hee hath indeed, but it is without
<PB N="74" REF="48">
him, like <HI>Nebuchadnezzer</HI> glorying in his gol|den Image, and worldlings proud of their gor|gious apparrell: surely it is the pittifull folly of a base minde, for a man to thinke that any thing can make him great, which is lesse then himselfe: but it is the recompence of mans er|ror, that because he lost the glory which God gaue him, he vainely seekes his glory in things which cannot profit him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">17 Pride both a dan|gerous and deceit|full euill.</NOTE></P>
<P>Pride is a dangerous euill, and most deceit|full: <HI>No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">erca virtutum, mater vittorum,</HI> the mo|ther of all vices, the stepmother of vertues; it can neuer attaine to that whereat it would be:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. de ciuit.

<P>Neither peace nor grace can be in that soule,<NOTE PLACE="marg">19 No peace can be to a proud heart.</NOTE> in which is not Humilitie: Peace cannot be to him, because hee seeketh his owne glory, and not the glory of God, therefore doth the Lord alwayes resist him; yea, at peace with himselfe can he not be, but as a tree on the toppe of a mountaine, which is tossed with euery winde, so is a proud man perturbed with euery acci|dent that fals out contrary to his humour, but humilitie is the resting bed of the soule, <HI>Learne of me</HI> (saith Christ) <HI>that I am lowly and meeke, and</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">20 No grace can lodge in a proud heart.</NOTE> <HI>yee shall finde rest to your foules.</HI> And as for grace it can no more bide to lodge in a proud heart, then raine can abide on the tops of mountains. The Church of Christ is called <HI>Lilium conual|lium,</HI> a Lillie of the vallies: for with the hum|ble and low in spirit his grace remaines, but the curse of the mountaines of Gilboe, whereon Israels glory was obscured, belongs properly to the proud and high heart, wherein the glory of God is defaced: let neuer the raine nor dew (of<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 1. 21.</NOTE> Gods grace) fall vpon it.</P>

<P>THere is no question betweene God and man<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 The onely questi|on betweene God and man is whose wil should be done.</NOTE> but this one, whose will should be done, whether Gods will or ours: for all our trans|gressions proceeds from this, that against all reason we preferre our will before the most holy will of the Lord our God.</P>
<P>For naturally the will of man is neither right|ly<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Mans will by na|ture how far dis|ordered&punc;</NOTE> affected toward his owne minde, nor yet to|ward the Lord his God. The will should be di|rected and gouerned by the minde, but as if the Cart should draw the Horse, such misorder is there, when the will enthralles the light of the minde to her peruerse and inordinate de|sires.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="51">The will of man vnregenerate exerciseth a<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 It is not subiect to God &amp; yet vsurpes dominion ouer his creatures.</NOTE> perpetuall inimitie against God: for first it re|fuses subiection to God, albeit many manner of wayes it be obliged to giue it. And next, as if that were too little, it vsurpes a dominion, and commandement ouer all the creatures of God.</P>

<P>Yea, let be his vsurpation ouer vnreasonable<NOTE PLACE="marg">5 The will of man would haue the wils of all men sub|iect vnto it.</NOTE> creatures, the man vnregenerate doth also what he can to draw the will of all other men in sub|iection vnto his: the adulterer craues that same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ilthy will in another that is in himself; the mur|therer craues the same cruell will in another, that is in himselfe, and so become guilty both of their owne and other mens damnation so far<NOTE PLACE="marg">6 It riseth also into a plaine opposition to the Creator himselfe.</NOTE> as they can get them to serue their will.</P>
<P>It proceedeth yet further to an insurrection against the creator himselfe, and albeit no ma|lice of man can impaire his eternall Maiestie, yet mans cursed and corrupted will doth what

it can to make him not to be: for either the vn|regenerate man wisheth that God knew not his sinne, or else if hee knew it, had no power to punish it, or else were iniust to ouersee it: <HI>exe|cranda plane &amp; crudelis malitia quae d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">i potenti|am,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bern. d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">sur.

<P>But albeit these two, the holy will of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">8 Thus in resisting God man receiues the worst.</NOTE> and corrupted will of man, fight together, yet the losse and hurt euer befalles to man, neuer to the Lord: for man doth no other thing but rash his heele against the pricke: which as our Lord said to <HI>Saul</HI> is very hard: <HI>durum calcitranti, non stimulo.

<P>But beside all this, mans will is now at vari|ance<NOTE PLACE="marg">10 Mans will iustly at variance with it selfe.</NOTE> with it selfe; if hee had kept true light in his minde, hee should neuer haue had but one will, and all his affections, with one harmonie had beene carryed to that which his will had willed: but now it is strange to see how within himselfe, his will is rent asunder, that what one way hee willeth, another way he willeth not, as is euident in the example of any proud coue|tous worldling, who as hee is a proud man hath a will, which as a couetous man hee will not.</P>

<P>But most clearely doth the Apostle decide<NOTE PLACE="marg">13 The naturall man hath a minde that cannot vnderstand, a will that cannot be subiect to God till it be regenerate.</NOTE> this controuersie, by declaring our naturall inabilitie to any good, when hee saith, the na|turall man hath such a minde as cannot vn|derstand the things of God; and such a will as is not subiect to the Law of God, nor yet can be, to wit, so long as it abideth a natu|rall will, not renued by the grace of Regene|ration.</P>
<P>And hereunto these words of <HI>Bernard</HI> may<NOTE PLACE="marg">14 Necessitie of sinne lying on the will excuseth it not, and why.</NOTE> serue for a cleare commentarie: <HI>Nescio quo prauo &amp; miro modo, ipsa sibi voluntas, peccato in</HI>

<P>COnscience is to be considered in her Na|ture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Conscience consi|dered as concern|ing her Nature.</NOTE> and Office. As for the nature of Con|science, it is better felt then it can be discerned: for in it wee feele not onely an vnderstanding power, as is in the minde, but also an agent or working power, as is in the will; so that it is not a faculty Theoricke onely, as the vnderstanding, nor practicke onely, as the will, but compoun|ded and mixt.</P>
<P>And that it is a different facultie from them<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 It is a different fa|cultie from the will and minde.</NOTE> both is euident by this, that it sits in the soule
<PB N="90" REF="56">
as a Controller both of the thoughts, of the minde, and desires of the will.</P>
<P>As for the office of Conscience, we may de|fine<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 Conscience consi|dered as concern|ing her Office.</NOTE> it thus. It is a spirituall iudge, depute by God the supreame iudge, and placed in the soule of man, to determine of all his actions, with him, to excuse him, or against him, to ac|cuse him, and that for the conuersion of some, and conuiction of others.</P>
<P>First then it is Gods deputie which vnder him<NOTE PLACE="marg">4 The word of con|science imports that another with it is vpon our se|crets.</NOTE> houlds court in the Soule of man: for euen the word of Conscience imports that there is ano|ther with it vpon the knowledge of our secrets; Science may be of one alone, but Conscience is of moe then one which are priuie to the same knowledge.</P>
<P>The same is euident from this, that Consci|ence<NOTE PLACE="marg">5 God and Consci|ence know our deeds together and will iudge them to|gether.</NOTE> is said to beare witnesse; where, of necessitie wee must distinguish betweene him to whom the witnesse is borne, and him of whom it is borne: the witnesse bearer is Conscience, the partie of whom the testimonie is made, is man. The great Iudge, who together with Consci|ence knowes our secrets is God: wherefore also Saint <HI>Iohn</HI> couples God and Conscience toge|ther; for they know our deeds together, and will iudge them together.</P>
<P>That Conscience is Gods deputie, it warnes<NOTE PLACE="marg">6 Conscience is Gods deputie, and therefore not to be despised.</NOTE> vs, not to despise the iudgement of Conscience,
<PB N="91" REF="56">
for the Lord in the end will ratifie the sentence of Coscience. If Conscience vpon light con|demn vs, God who is greater then Conscience,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Iohn 3. 20.</NOTE> and knowes much more then Conscience doth know, will much more condemne vs.</P>
<P>An example whereof wee may see cleerely<NOTE PLACE="marg">7 The sentence gi|uen by Conscience will be confirmed by God.</NOTE> in <HI>Adam,</HI> who immediately after that hee had sinned ranne away, and hid himselfe among the bushes: No man pursued him; no Angell reprooued him, the Lord was not yet come to iudge him, onely he found himselfe condemned in the iudgement of his owne conscience, which he could not abide, and the Lord when he comes condemnes him for the same fact, for which his conscience had condemned him before.</P>
<P>And from this also that Conscience is Gods<NOTE PLACE="marg">8 The maiestie and authoritie of Con|science, it stands against all the world.</NOTE> deputie proceeds the authoritie of Conscience, whose sentence is pronounced with such ma|iestie and power, that albeit the whole world would oppone vnto it, yet neither are they able to revoke it, nor resist it. Wherefore S. <HI>Paul</HI> sets<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Corinth. 4. 4.</NOTE> the sentence of his Conscience that did iustifie him, against the calumnies of all men whatsoe|uer that did condemne him.</P>
<P>On the contrary, if Conscience doe accuse<NOTE PLACE="marg">9 If Conscience ter|rifie no creature can comfort.</NOTE> and terrifie, all the men and creatures in the world are not able to comfort. We may see this in <HI>Adam;</HI> the pleasures of Paradise auailed him nothing after that his Conscience condemned
<PB N="92" REF="57">
him: the same wee may see in <HI>Baltasar,</HI> who<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. 5.</NOTE> had about him all wordly comforts that the heart of man could desire, but because con|science was against him, none of these could re|medie his terror.</P>
<P>But this is more also, that Conscience is the<NOTE PLACE="marg">10 The seat of consci|ence is not the bo|dy but the soule.</NOTE> deputie of God in the soule of man: Consci|ence hath not her seat in the face, no other man can know it; nor yet in the speech, no hy|pocrisie nor dissimulation of man can thrall Conscience to iustifie his words, albeit a thou|sand times he would alledge it.</P>
<P>Againe, the corruptible body will be dissol|ued<NOTE PLACE="marg">11 After death of the body conscience liues.</NOTE> by dust, but Conscience which hath her seat in the soule, shall liue when the body is dead, and stand vp before God after death, ey|ther for thee or against thee. To the wicked af|ter death, Conscience shall be a biting worme, for euer to torment them; but to the godly it shal be as a pleasant Paradice, rendring to them infinit ioyes, wherein they shall abide for euer.</P>
<P>The offices of Conscience are three especi|ally&punc;<NOTE PLACE="marg">12 The three-fold of|fice of Conscience.</NOTE> first, it records and keepes in remembrance deedes that wee haue done: Secondly, it de|termineth and iudgeth of them with vs or a|gainst vs: thirdly, it executeth the sentence de|terminate.</P>
<P>As for the first, we may feele in experience, that wee doe nothing, which Conscience writes
<PB N="93" REF="57">
not, and layes vp in register; wee may change<NOTE PLACE="marg">13 Conscience goes with vs whereuer we goe to beare record of all that wee doe.</NOTE> our place, but still we finde that conscience goes with vs; we may cast off our garments, but not our Conscience wee may separate our selues from men, but when we are most solitarie, then doe we find, that Conscience is most familiar with vs: goe where wee will, doe what wee will, Conscience is alwayes vpon our secrets.</P>
<P>As for the second, like as Conscience know|eth<NOTE PLACE="marg">14 In euery action Conscience deter|mines with vs or against vs.</NOTE> and registreth all that wee doe, so in euery action, it determineth eyther with vs, or against vs, accusing or excusing vs.</P>
<P>And in this determination Conscience pro|ceedeth<NOTE PLACE="marg">15 In determining of our doings Consci|ence proceedes ac|cording to light.</NOTE> according to her light, which is two|fold; either the light of Nature, or the light of the Word. As for the light of Nature, there are no people so barbarous, but that part of Con|science which is called <GAP DESC="foreign"> keepes in them some sparkes of the knowledge of good and e|uill, which the most prophane man that euer was cannot get vtterly suffocated, albeit faine hee would wish it were not in him to conuince him.</P>
<P>Now the reasoning of Conscience is very<NOTE PLACE="marg">16 How the reasoning of conscience is very forcible.</NOTE> strong euen when it conuinceth Pagans by the light of Nature, but much more strong when it conuinceth Christians by the Word of God: for that part of Conscience <GAP DESC="foreign"> which doth keepe the light of the Law, furnisheth the
<PB N="94" REF="58">
proposition, adulterers, murtherers, and so forth, are worthy of fearefull iudgement: <GAP DESC="foreign"> againe that part of Conscience, wherein is the knowledge and remembrance of thy deedes, makes the assumpsion; but so it is, thou hast com|mitted adultery or murther, and shall remem|ber thee both of time and place, and other cir|cumstances, whereupon will follow an ineuita|ble conclusion.</P>
<P>But here wee must remember to put a diffe|rence<NOTE PLACE="marg">17 Difference to be put between Con|science and error of Conscience.</NOTE> betweene Conscience and error of Con|science: for Conscience may erre for want of cleare light, and become eyther ouer strict, counting that euill and vnlawfull which is good and lawfull; or else ouer large, thinking that lawfull which is plainly vnlawfull: and here di|ligent paines would be taken by prayer and reading, to informe the conscience with suffici|ent light out of Gods word.</P>
<P>And herewithall wee must remember that<NOTE PLACE="marg">18 The sentence of Conscience is nei|ther perfect nor supreame.</NOTE> conscience suppose it giue a diuine sentence, yet is it neither perfect nor supreame: not per|fect, because the light that informes it is but in a part; for if the conscience be euill, yet can it not accuse thee of all the euill that is in thee; and if it be good it cannot also remember and record all the good which God by his grace hath done in thee, and that as I said, by reason of the weaknesse of her light.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="58">Whereof it comes to passe that in this life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">91 Therefore when it absolues, it giues not perfect and per|manent peace in this life.</NOTE> the Conscience cannot haue perfect nor con|tinuall peace without feare, because it looketh continually for the definitiue sentence of that supreme and highest Iudge; then shall it be pa|cified, and neuer doubt any more, when it shall receiue that ioyfull sentence; Come to me thou faithfull seruant.</P>
<P>And yet Conscience hauing once giuen out<NOTE PLACE="marg">20 Yet in this life it begins the executi|on of the sentence giuen by it.</NOTE> sentence, beginneth the execution thereof, with great authority, rendring ioy to them that haue done well, feare and terror to them that haue done euill, which is no other thing but a fore|runner of that great and final retribution which God, who will iustifie the decree of conscience, shall render to all men.</P>
<P>Whereof we are admonished neuer to neg|lect<NOTE PLACE="marg">21 Affections are novv louder then Con|science, but it vvill not be long so.</NOTE> the accusations of Conscience: for albeit that now the perturbation of vnruly affections be so loud that the voyce of Conscience con|demning the foolish and crooked wayes of men, is eyther but weakely heard, or else not at all; yet is there a day comming, wherein these perturbations shall be silent, and Con|science shall speake with so loud a voyce that the deafe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> eares of men shall heare it, the Lord himselfe also taking part with Consci|ence, and iustifying all her accusations against them.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="59">And therefore seeing wee can neyther get<NOTE PLACE="marg">22 Good to agree vvith conscience in time.</NOTE> Conscience corrupted to conceale our faults, neither yet smothered &amp; put out by any length of time, as is manifest in <HI>Iosephs</HI> brethren, whose<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 42. 21.</NOTE> Consciences troubled them in Egypt, for that crueltie which many yeares before they had done against their brother in Canaan: but that still if wee doe against God, Conscience will speake against vs, it is good for vs to agree with Conscience in time, and in all our wayes to seeke her approbation.</P>
<P>Now the ends for which God hath vnder<NOTE PLACE="marg">23 For what ends is Conscience placed in man.</NOTE> himselfe deputed Conscience in the soule of man, are the conuersion of his owne, and iust conuiction of his enemies: for herein greatly appeareth his equitie towards all men, and spe|ciall loue and fauour towards his owne.</P>
<P>As the Lord hath protested by an oath that<NOTE PLACE="marg">24 Conscience proues that God desireth not the death of a sinner.</NOTE> hee desireth not the death of a sinner; so by his deed he declares it in this, that he hath put in man a warner to fore-tell vnto him that heauie wrath, whereinto he will fall, vnlesse in time he repent, and turne from his euill wayes.</P>
<P>And wonderfull it is how this shall conuince<NOTE PLACE="marg">25 The vvicked who liue against Con|science, vvill before conuicted.</NOTE> the wicked man in the houre of death, when their conscience shall stand vp before the su|preame Iudge, and testifie against him in this manner; O Lord I haue giuen this man accor|ding as thou deputed me, warning euery day
<PB N="97" REF="59">
for his sinnes, and hath terrified him for them, but hee would not receiue my correction. Oh that impenitent men could consider how this despising of Conscience shall be a great aug|mentation of their iudgement!</P>
<P>But on the other part, to the children of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">26 Vse of Conscience to the godly is: 1. As a Paedagoge to lead them the right vvay.</NOTE> Conscience, of his speciall mercy is giuen for these two vses: first, it is as a Paedagoge ap|pointed by God to guide his children in the right way.</P>
<P>Secondly, when they goe wrong, it is a di|uine<NOTE PLACE="marg">27 2. As a vvarner to tel them vvhen they goe vvrong.</NOTE> warner within them, which suffers them neyther to eate nor sleepe long in rest, till they returne to the Lord by repentance: for as <HI>Pe|ter</HI> was wakened by the crowing of the Cock, and made to weepe bitterly for his sinnes, so is the crowing and accusing voyce of Conscience to the godly.</P>
<P>Thus we see how it is a great benefit to Gods<NOTE PLACE="marg">28 A feeling consci|ence a great benefit to Gods children.</NOTE> children, to haue a liuing, feeling, and wake|ing Conscience: for eyther it keepes them that they do not euill, or that they continue not in it, as we may see in <HI>Dauid,</HI> whose Conscience was more troubled for cutting the lap of <HI>Sauls</HI> gar|ment, then <HI>Saul</HI> was for cutting off the liues of fourescore seruants of the Lord.</P>
<P>Wheras on the contrary, the Lord in his anger<NOTE PLACE="marg">29 A conscience past feeling is vvrath to the vvicked.</NOTE> suffers Sathan so to benumbe the conscience of the wicked, as if they were burnt with an hot
<PB N="98" REF="60">
yron, whereof it comes to passe, that being past feeling, they commit iniquitie with greedines.</P>
<P>Surely a good conscience is mans paradice<NOTE PLACE="marg">30 A good conscience is mans paradice on earth.</NOTE> vpon earth, therefore <HI>Salomon</HI> called it a conti|nuall feast; it is the fruit of righteousnesse, and euer bringeth out peace and ioy: in these three stands the beginning of eternall life.</P>
<P>But as Sathan enuyed <HI>Adam</HI> dwelling in his<NOTE PLACE="marg">31 Sathan enuieth mans dvvelling in it.</NOTE> Paradice, so doth he enuy euery Christian that dwels in the Paradice of a good Conscience, and therefore doth what he can to entise him to sinne, that so he may driue him out of it: for which cause we haue neede by daily repentance to take away the euill wee haue done, and by godly circumspection to eschew his snares in time to come.</P>

<P>AS by nature mans heart is emptied of all<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Man by nature is filled with a sinfull hatred.</NOTE> holy Loue, so it is filled with a sinfull ha|tred, a monstrous euill, offensiue to God, to our neighbour, yea, and to our selues.</P>
<P>Naturally Man hates the Lord, according<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 For naturally man hates the Lord.</NOTE> to that which our Sauiour saith <HI>hee that doth euill hateth the light:</HI> the euill Conscience of the wicked abhorreth the Lord, who is that first, and great light, from whom all others haue that light which they haue; wishing that eyther there were not a God at all, or else that he were like them.</P>
<P>He hates in like manner good men, euen for
<PB N="113" REF="67">
that good which is in them, and that with such<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 And he hateth also good men for the good that is in them.</NOTE> a raging malice that no band of Nature can restraine it: thus <HI>Caine</HI> hated his brother <HI>A|bel,</HI> and why? onely because his works were good: <HI>Rahel</HI> hated her Sister <HI>Leah;</HI> and why? onely because shee was fruitfull, her selfe be|ing barren: and <HI>Ioseph</HI> also was hated of his owne brethren, for no other cause, but for that his earthly Father loued him, and his heauenly Father had blessed him with the gift of Reuelation or Prophecie aboue them.</P>
<P>O cursed roote of bitternesse which doth<NOTE PLACE="marg">4 It is a diuellish thing to hate a man for good.</NOTE> cause man to hate his owne, and that onely for the good that is in them! O greatest euill so directly contrary to the greatest good! God is so good, that of euery euill hee worketh good to his owne: and hatred is so euill that the good things of God become vnto it a matter of grea|ter euill.<NOTE PLACE="marg">5 Man a second Sa|than, inferior to him in tvvo things onely.</NOTE></P>
<P>Thus is man who was made to the simi|litude of God, become an incarnate diuell, or as <HI>Augustine</HI> cals him, <HI>Secundus Diabolus,</HI> infe|rior<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ad frat. in Erem. Serm. 28.</NOTE> onely to Sathan in two respects.</P>
<P>For whereas Sathan being now very neere<NOTE PLACE="marg">6 First, that being of shorter continu|ance then Sathan, he is not of so great experience.</NOTE> sixe thousand yeares olde, hath the subtiltie of his Nature (wherein also he doth exceed man,) helped by long experience to doe wickedly, Man being of shorter continuance, cannot e|quall him.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="68">Againe, man is clogged with a body, which<NOTE PLACE="marg">7 Secondly, that he is clad vvith a bodie, vvhich is a great im|pediment to his vvicked concepti|ons in their execu|tion.</NOTE> is a great impediment to the perfection and ac|complishment of that which his Spirit concei|ueth; it being farre otherwise with the actions of the bodie, which require the circumstances of place, and persons, then with the concepti|ons of the minde, which without any such thing are perfected.</P>
<P>Otherwayes, if the wickednesse of mans<NOTE PLACE="marg">8 What a vvorld of vvickednesse should be in man if his thoughts vvere exe|cuted as they are conceiued?</NOTE> heart brake out as it is conceiued; if euery hate|full thought brake out into murther; and euery vncleane lust into a carnall act, O what a world of wickednesse should then be discouered in man? then should it be manifest, that Man for similitude of Natures, were but an incarnate Di|uell, as I haue said.</P>
<P>As the graces of the Spirit keepe one fellow|ship,<NOTE PLACE="marg">9 Vices goe together linked in one Chaine.</NOTE> so disordered affections, which vnder their proper name, in effect are but vices, goe toge|ther like the linkes of one chaine.</P>
<P>For Hatred comes of euill parents: Pride<NOTE PLACE="marg">10 Hatred is bred of very euill Parents.</NOTE> begets Anger; Anger breeds Enuy; and Enuy brings out Hatred.

<P>Hatred againe strengthened by time brings<NOTE PLACE="marg">12 Hatred brings out most abhominable Children.</NOTE> out as abhominable Children; to wit, Lying, Detraction, and Murther. By Lying the hatefull man layes that euill vpon another which is not his: and by Detraction taketh from him the praise of that good which appertaines to him: therefore the Apostle ioynes these as twinnes together <GAP DESC="foreign"> and <GAP DESC="foreign">, Euny and Murther:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Galath. 5. 21.</NOTE> for Enuy hauing begotten Hatred, Hatred brin|geth out Lying and backbiting, and afterward actuall Murther; if God doe not stay.</P>
<P>Yea, as the Basiliske slayes the man, and it<NOTE PLACE="marg">13 The hatefull man slayes like the Basi|liske.</NOTE> is not perceiued how, so the hatefull man mur|thers his brother, though no man can see how hee stroke him.</P>
<P>The Apostle cals Auarice the root of all euill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">14 Hatred exceeds Auarice in euill.</NOTE> and so it is; yet Hatred exceeds it in euill. The auaritious man will giue nothing of his owne, yet hee cares not how much be giuen by ano|ther: but the hatefull man can neither giue himselfe, nor be content another should giue to him whom hee hates: yea, <HI>his eye is euill because God is good.</HI></P>
<P>In a word, among all wicked men a hatefull
<PB N="116" REF="69">
man is the worst: other wicked men delight in<NOTE PLACE="marg">15 Of all vvicked men a hateful man is the vvorst.</NOTE> their owne good, at least in appearance, but the hatefull man is tormented with the good of o|thers: <HI>ille diligit mala, hic odit bona, vt prope to|lerabilior</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambros. off. lib. 2. cap. 30.</NOTE> <HI>sit, qui sibi vult bona (saltem apparen|ter) quam qui mala omnibus.</HI></P>

<P>And as for all those troubles that come by<NOTE PLACE="marg">4 The confidence of a Christian in such troubles as come by men.</NOTE> men, they consider that they are moderated by God, according to that which our Sauiour said to <HI>Pilate: Thou couldst haue no power ouer mee were it not giuen thee from aboue.</HI> And in this<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. 27.</NOTE> by manifold experience hath God confirmed them.</P>

<P>And hereof it comes to passe, that vnto the<NOTE PLACE="marg">7 Abuse of Gods gifts punished in the wicked.</NOTE> wicked, the good creatures become the meanes of their greater condemnation, yea, and oft|times also of their present confusion in this life.

<P><PB N="155" REF="89">The causes of griefe in a Christian are three|fold:<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 Causes of griefe a|rising from our selues are three|fold.</NOTE> the first is the consideration of that which wee haue beene: the second is the consideration of that which we are: the third, the considera|tion of that which we would be, and are not.</P>
<P>As for the first: so long as a man and his sin<NOTE PLACE="marg">4 A man so long as he is in his sinnes thinkes them no cause of griefe.</NOTE> are one, he neither feeles the weight of it, nor the wrath that followes it, but reioyceth in that which should be the matter of his griefe, but so soone as man by grace is parted from his sin, then becomes sin a burden to him, and a mat|ter of his griefe, which before was the matter of his ioy.</P>
<P>One example of this we haue in <HI>Dauid,</HI> who<NOTE PLACE="marg">5 An example hereof in <HI>Dauid.</HI></NOTE> hauing committed adultery, and going about to cloake it with murther, was neither troubled himselfe with this abhominable sinne, nor yet would haue others troubled with it, and therfore wrote he to <HI>Ioab</HI> a command, indirectly to slay <HI>Vriah,</HI> and there withall subioyned; <HI>let not this</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Sam. 11. 25.</NOTE> <HI>trouble thee:</HI> but how much it troubled him when God renued him by repentance, the 32. and 51. Psalmes doe testifie.</P>
<P>Another we haue in the Apostle Saint <HI>Paul,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">6 Another in <HI>Paul.</HI></NOTE> who while hee was in his sinnes persecuted with pleasure the Saints of God: but when God sundred him from his sinnes, what a griefe that sinne in speciall was to him, he witnesseth him|selfe; <HI>I am not</HI> (said hee) <HI>worthy to be called an</HI>
<PB N="156" REF="90">
<HI>Apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God.</HI></P>
<P>For when the Lord looseth a sinner from his<NOTE PLACE="marg">7 When God looses a man from sin, he binds him to an ha|tred of sinne.</NOTE> sinne, hee bindeth him to a perpetuall hatred of his sinne: and therefore is it, that when hee hath taken away the guiltinesse of a sinne, yet hee will haue the memory thereof to remaine: for as thornes which are euill in the garden, are<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the memory of sinne remaineth when the guilt thereof is remoued.</NOTE> good in the hedge to fence it; so sinnes which are euill in the affection, hindring the growth of grace in the soule, are good in the memorie, to humble vs for our former sinnes, and guard vs against sinnes to come.</P>
<P>And this godly sorrow for sinne committed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">8 Persian Kings could suffer no mourners in their presence, but it is not so with God.</NOTE> being no other but the dolors of our new birth, should not discourage Gods children, but ra|ther they are to be comforted with it.

Mourners might not stand in presence of the Persian Kings, therefore <HI>Mordecai</HI> clad in sack|cloth, got not entrance at the Kings gate; but whom doth the Lord comfort? is it not those who mourne? to whom grants hee most familiar accesse? surely, to those that are most entirely humbled and cast cowne before him.</P>
<P>Then are wee most welcome to God, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">9 The Lord liketh our mourning countenance best.</NOTE> our face most pleasant vnto him, when it is wa|tred with the teares of repentance: therefore is it his comfortable speech to his Church, <HI>My</HI>

<P>As for the second: the consideration of that<NOTE PLACE="marg">10 The Christians tentations are a griefe to him.</NOTE> which wee are, is also to a Christian the matter of his griefe; first, in regard of our continuall temptations to sinne, Sathan euer seeking to re|couer his old possession in vs. As <HI>Pharaoh</HI> fol|lowed Israel, so Sathan followeth the redeemed man, doing all that he can to bring him backe againe to his former seruitude and bondage.<NOTE PLACE="marg">11 And his manifold crosses.</NOTE></P>

<P>And herewith also comes in the troublesome<NOTE PLACE="marg">12 And the troubles of Gods Church.</NOTE> estate of Gods Church: as good <HI>Nehemiah</HI> was not so merry for the preferment he had in the Court of King <HI>Artashashte,</HI> as sorrowfull for the desolation of Ierusalem; <HI>why should not</HI> (said he)<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nehem. 2. 3.</NOTE> <HI>my countenance be sad, when the citie of my fathers lyeth waste?</HI> so is it with the Christian, though his owne particular estate, be neuer so good, yet is it his griefe to see the Church of God in trouble.</P>
<P>The third matter of our griefe ariseth of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">13 And the long delay of that promised Kingdome.</NOTE> consideration of that which wee are not, but would be.

<P>THE heauiest, griefe of a Christian is that<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 The greatest griefe is griefe of Consci|ence</NOTE> which doth proceede from a troubled Conscience: <HI>The Spirit of a man may sustaine his infirmities, but a wounded Spirit who can</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prou. 19.</NOTE> <HI>beare it.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 The health of con|science consists in two things.</NOTE></P>
<P>The health of conscience consists in these two; first, in a sense of Gods mercy pardoning our

<P>And the disease or trouble of conscience pro|ceedeth<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 Where-from the disease of consci|ence proceeds, to wit.</NOTE> from the contrary euill: for if the soule be forsaken for a time, it becomes vnable for spirituall exercise.

<P>But the other euill is much more fearefull,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4 2. But when hee pursues it with a sense of his wrath, then it is worse troubled.</NOTE> when God erects a tribunal in the conscience, &amp; giues out into it a iust condemnatorie sentence for sin which cannot be denyed; there followeth vpon it a sense of wrath, which like a fire bur|ning within it, doth miserably torment the soule of him in whom it is.</P>
<P>Whereupon there followeth such a distem|perature<NOTE PLACE="marg">5 Trouble of minde distempers the whole body.</NOTE> of the whole body, that as <HI>Dauid</HI> felt in himselfe, the moisture thereof is turned into the drought of Sommer: the reason hereof is<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 32.</NOTE> giuen by <HI>Bernard,</HI> the soule hath vnder it a bo|dy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bern. in paruis. serm. 48.</NOTE> which it gouernes, aboue it the Lord, in<NOTE PLACE="marg">August. in Ioan. tract. 19.</NOTE> whom it rests. <HI>Viuificat Anima &amp; viuificatur:</HI> if that life by which the soule liueth relinquish it, that is, if the help and comfort of Gods bles|sed

<P>And yet both these wayes it pleaseth the Lord<NOTE PLACE="marg">6 The first of these spirituall troubles compared to a lin|gring disease.</NOTE> to exercise his children in this life: first, by de|sertion, wherein sense of mercy and spirituall strength vnto good is with-drawne from them, and this is vnto them as a lingring disease; the fruit whereof is, first, to humble them for their former sinnes; secondly, to make them esteeme more of the presence of God when he grants it vnto them.</P>
<P>But the other is worse, when not onely hee<NOTE PLACE="marg">7 The second to a fearefull consump|tion.</NOTE> forsaketh them, but also as it were, doth pursue them with his wrath: this is like vnto a feare|full consumption, which if it continued would vndoe them: <HI>Infernus enim quidam animae rea</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bern. in assump.

<P>THE Gospell of our Lord Iesus Christ, is<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 The Gospel a mir|ror, wherein we see the similitude of Gods Image, and are transformed into it.</NOTE> compared by S. <HI>Paul</HI> to a mirror, wherein wee behold the glorie of God with open face, and by which wee are transformed into the si|militude of his Image: for so many as are the Sons of God by regeneration, to them he com|municates his Image by his word and spirit.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="96">His goodnesse is extended ouer all his crea|tures,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 The light and goodnesse of God is extended vnto all men.</NOTE> and he illuminateth euery one that comes into the world: for euery man by nature hath in him as much light as furnisheth to him some principles of good and euill, to make him in|excusable in all the euill that hee doth.</P>
<P>But as for his owne Children, hee markes<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 But his Image is communicated to his children onely.</NOTE> them from the rest of the world by his owne image: and this is it wherein we should chiefly try our selues whether wee be the workmanship<NOTE PLACE="marg">How wee may know whether we be Gods workman ship by the new creation, or no.</NOTE> of God by regeneration, as we are his creatures by the first creation or not: and this tryall is to be made by our similitude and conformity with him.</P>
<P>As other affections are reformed in the re|generation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4 Patience is refor|med also in our re|generation.</NOTE> so also is our Patience. Concerning it, three things are to be considered; first, the nature of Patience; secondly, the necessitie; thirdly, the vtilitie thereof.</P>
<P>Patience, as saith the Apostle, is a grace very<NOTE PLACE="marg">5 A description of the Nature of Pati|ence.</NOTE> needefull for vs, to sustaine vs in the doing of Gods will, and in the expectation of his promi|ses. <HI>Heb.</HI> 10. From this is borrowed that des|cription<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hebrewes 10.</NOTE> of <HI>Augustines: Patience is a grace of the Spirit, flowing from faith, by which we suffer euill things willingly, because wee will not forsake those good things by which we may come to better.</HI></P>
<P>The euils which with Patience wee must suf|fer, are not the euils of sin; for it is not Patience
<PB N="170" REF="97">
but effeminate feeblenesse to suffer it, but the<NOTE PLACE="marg">6 Patience suffers not the euils of sinne but the euils of af|fliction.</NOTE> euill of affliction. Againe, the good which wee will not forsake, is as saith the Apostle, the do|ing of the good will of God, &amp; the better things which God hath promised, and wee doc hope hereafter to obtayne.</P>
<P>The second is the necessitie of Patience. In<NOTE PLACE="marg">7 Patience necessary for two causes: 1. Because the good that God hath pro mis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> dis not pre|sently performed.</NOTE> two respects Patience is most necessarie: first, the good which God hath promised and wee hope for is suspended and delayed for a time: which time though in regard of the dispenser it be short, because hee knowes when hee will giue it, yet to the expectant it is very long, ther|fore haue we need with Patience to wait for it.</P>
<P>Next because of the present manifold euils<NOTE PLACE="marg">8 2. Because of the present euils, wher|with now wee are exercised.</NOTE> wherewith in this life we are exercised. We liue in the company of the wicked, who are vnto vs as the Cananits wer to Israel, pricks in our side, and thornes in our eyes. Neither will the Lord haue them separated from vs&punc; but the popple must grow with the good Wheat till the day of har|uest. <HI>Patienter ita&abque; ferendum est, quod festinanter auferendum non est.</HI></P>

<P>Now to the third, the vtilitie of Patience:<NOTE PLACE="marg">11 The principall praise of Patience.</NOTE> Euery grace of the spirit hath in it some speciall vertue, whereby it excels another, but the prin|cipall praise of Patience is pointed out by our Sauiour in that precept, <HI>Possesse your soules in Patience.</HI></P>
<P>These are three excellent graces, Faith, Loue<NOTE PLACE="marg">12 By Faith we pos|sesse Christ, by Loue our neigh|bour, by Patience our selues.</NOTE> and Patience: by Faith I possesse Christ Iesus; by Loue I possesse my neighbour and make him mine owne; by Patience I possesse my selfe: hee that hath not Faith is without the Head, hee that hath not Loue is without the body, and hee that hath not Patience is without himselfe, no maister nor possessor of himselfe, but still o|uer-ruled by the will of another.</P>
<P>Beside this, Patience entertaines all the rest of<NOTE PLACE="marg">13 Patience preserues the other Graces of the Spirit.</NOTE> the graces of the spirit: <HI>it a enim proposita est Dei</HI>

<P>And againe we are to remember that of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">17 Wicked men are but Sathans instru|ments.</NOTE> Apostle, <HI>we wrestle not against flesh and bloud, but against principalities and powers, &amp;c.</HI> that is, that it is not so much men clothed with flesh and bloud that fights against vs, as Sathan that wor|keth in them; <HI>nihil enim aliud sunt omnes impij,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gregor.

<P>Wherein wee haue three things to be con|sidered:<NOTE PLACE="marg">15 Three things con|sidered in the pre|cept.</NOTE> first, a Precept, <HI>be angry,</HI> commanding moderate anger: secondly a Preuention of car|nall anger, <HI>but sinne not:</HI> thirdly a Prescription of a remedy against carnall anger, if at any time it ouertake vs; <HI>Let not the Sunne goe downe vp|on your wrath.</HI></P>
<P>Of the first wee learne that there is a holie<NOTE PLACE="marg">16 A holy anger, which is commen|ded.</NOTE> anger commendable, because commanded: ex|amples of it wee haue in <HI>Moses,</HI> in <HI>Phinees,</HI> in <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> in our Sauiour, when he saw the tem|ple abused; in the Pastor of Ephesus: and this is so farre from being a sinne, that it is a great sinne not to haue it, as wee see in <HI>El<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">,</HI> who is sharply corrected of God, because hee was not angry at his sonnes when they ranne into an open slander.</P>
<P>In the second wee haue a preuention of car|nall<NOTE PLACE="marg">17 Three helpes a|gainst carnall an|ger.</NOTE> anger, <HI>but sinne not:</HI> to help vs to the pra|ctise of this, three things are needfull, when wee are prouoked vnto anger; 1. silence: 2. conside|ration: 3. Prayer.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="104">The first is determinate silence: where there is<NOTE PLACE="marg">18 The first is deter|minate silence.</NOTE> no timber the fire dyes out, saith <HI>Salomon;</HI> but as the barking of one dog doth prouoke the barking of another, so the words of Anger returned to him that iniured thee, stirreth vp but more contention. If thou esteemest him<NOTE PLACE="marg">Many men igno|rantly make their aduersaries their maisters, learning at them how to speake euill for euill.</NOTE> thine aduersary that hath abused thee by words, why wilt thou make him thy maister? which in effect thou dost when thou learnest at him, by the like speeches to abuse thy selfe, which hee hath vsed before thee.</P>
<P>The turbulent waues of the sea, though they<NOTE PLACE="marg">19 How meeknesse &amp; patience ouer-come stormie words.</NOTE> seeme as if they would raise themselues vnto heauen, yet comming to their bounds, if they fall vpon the soft and plaine sands, they returne<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nazian.</NOTE> back peaceably and calme; but if they encoun|ter with hard rocks, they breake and become more turbulent: so thou if thou meetest thine aduersary with meeknesse, thou shalt send him away pacified; if otherwise thou stand as a rocke to resist him, setting thy pride against his pride, thou encreasest the storme of perturbation both in his heart, and thine owne also.</P>
<P>The second remedie is a foure-fold conside|ration;<NOTE PLACE="marg">20 The second help is consideration.</NOTE> first, of thy selfe; secondly, of thy Sauiour; thirdly, of thine enemy Sathan; fourthly, of his Instruments.</P>

<P>If the euill spoken of thee be false, it per|taines<NOTE PLACE="marg">22 How all the euill words of men whe|ther they be true or false are to be recei|ued.</NOTE> not to thee; if it be true, thou hast cause to be angry at thy selfe, and mend it; and if it be already mended in thee, and yet by another vncharitably obiected to thee, <HI>quantumcun&abque; ille</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. cont.

<P>Consider that reuenge is both vnreasonable<NOTE PLACE="marg">23 It is vnreasonable for vs to seeke re|uenge, seeing Christ and his Saints are not yet reuenged.</NOTE> and hurtfull. Vnreasonable: the blood of the Saints shed from <HI>Abel</HI> to this day is not yet re|uenged, as you may see by their owne com|plaint, <HI>Reuel.</HI> 6.

It is no otherwise in all such priuate reuenges, then if
<PB N="187" REF="105">
thou shouldst first put a sword through thy selfe, that afterward thou mightest strike thy neigh|bour with it.</P>
<P>Secondly, consider thy Sauiour, who when<NOTE PLACE="marg">25 The Patience of Christ, stands for an example of pa|tience to vs.</NOTE> he was reuiled for thy sake, reuiled not againe: when hee was buffetted bare it patiently, and prayed for them on the Crosse that persecu|ted him: and if there be any sparke of grace in vs, it should make vs ashamed of our natu|rall pride, which carryeth vs to reuenge our smallest iniuries.</P>
<P>Thirdly, hold thine eye vpon Sathan, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">26 In all our wrongs we are to consider Sathan as our prin|cipall enemie.</NOTE> remember what euer instrument he set before thy face to diuert thee, hee himselfe is lying in secret ambushment, as thy principall ene|mie to snare thee, who hath no other end pro|posed to him, in all iniuries done to thee, but to prouoke thee to impatience, that so thou maist blaspheme God, at least murmure against him.</P>
<P>Last of all, looke aright to the visible instru|ments<NOTE PLACE="marg">27 For the wicked are his members mo|ued by him.</NOTE> of thy trouble, considering them not as naked persons working by themselues, but as members of Sathan, moued and prouoked by him.

<P>IT is not possible to keepe the heart in a good<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 The heart cannot be kept, vnlesse the senses be kept.</NOTE> estate without diligent obseruation of the sen|ses, no more then a besieged Citie can be de|fended, where the ports thereof are neglected, and left open to euery one that likes to enter into it.</P>
<P>There are two sorts of euils within vs which<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Two sorts of euill in man, 1. <HI>innatum,</HI> 2 <HI>seminatum.</HI></NOTE> trouble vs; first, <HI>malum innatum;</HI> secondly, <HI>malum seminatum:</HI> the first is euill bred in vs of our owne nature; the other is euill sowne in vs by that Wicked one: yet is there no man of so quick a sense, that he is alwayes able to distin|guish betweene these two.</P>
<P>Both of these euils haue their passage by the<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 Both of these haue their course by the senses, for euill bred within vs breakes out by the senses.</NOTE> senses: for the one, <HI>malum innatum,</HI> home-bred corruption, cannot lurke within, but seeketh to burst out at the senses, to the infection of others, according to that of our Sauiour; <HI>Out of the heart comes murthers, adulteries, &amp;c.</HI> the prin|cipall passages of this infecting euill are the eye, and the mouth.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="117">The other againe, <HI>Malum seminatum,</HI> is con|uaied<NOTE PLACE="marg">4 And euill without vs is conuayed in by the senses, speci|ally by the eye and eare.</NOTE> to the heart by the subtiltie of Sathan, from exterior obiects, vnto which he laboureth to allure the heart, that hee may diuide it from God. And this euill is conuaied to the heart specially by the eye and eare: whereof it is eui|dent with what continuall care the senses are to be obserued, that from without, euill come not to make the heart worse then it is, and from within, euill come not to infect others that are without.</P>
<P>For as that Citie is in great danger, which<NOTE PLACE="marg">5 A Christian like a besieged citie that hath traitors with|in.</NOTE> hath not onely without it strong enemies assaul|ting it, but hath also within it false traitors to be|tray it: so is it with our soules, who without vs haue Sathan with his inuisible legions of spiri|tuall wickednesse, and visible armies of worldly allurements ready to impugne vs: and within haue our owne traiterous affections confede|rate with him ready to betray vs.</P>
<P>And therefore (as I said) great need haue we<NOTE PLACE="marg">6 We haue need ther|fore to watch that these two armies of euils doe not meet within vs.</NOTE> to watch ouer our selues, that these two corrup|tions which are as seuerall armies against vs, meete not together: for if <HI>Malum seminatum</HI> come in to strengthen <HI>Malum innatum,</HI> they shall breed a very dangerous and hard battaile vnto vs.</P>
<P>Whereas if wee take paines to fortifie our selues against the enemie that is without and
<PB N="211" REF="117">
to slay the corruption that is bred within vs, so<NOTE PLACE="marg">7 We must fortifie our selues against both.</NOTE> soone as it is conceiued, wee shall possesse our selues in peace. It is great wisedome to fight with our enemie when hee is weakest, the best time to slay a Cockatrice is while it is in the shell, before it come to be a Serpent: if we dash<NOTE PLACE="marg">8 It is best to sight a|gainst the begin|nings of euils with in vs.</NOTE> not the heads of the infants of Babell, they will breed vs more trouble, when they come to be stronger men. Sinne is a strong enemie when it is in the Cogitation, stronger when it is in the affection, strongest when it breakes out in|to action, confirmed in strength if wee conti|nue in it. Therefore euen the beginnings of it are to be resisted.</P>
<P>This as I said cannot be done without a di|ligent<NOTE PLACE="marg">9 The soule cannot be kept if Sathan possesse the ports of the Bare and the Eye.</NOTE> custodie of the Senses, specially of the Eare, and the Eye; these are the first ports at which Sathan carryed in death to the soule of our mother <HI>Euah:</HI> for by hearing the seducer her heart was infected, and by looking out of her corruption to the forbidden Tree, shee was entangled in the actuall transgression of Gods commandement.</P>
<P>Besides this, many wayes in Nature hath God<NOTE PLACE="marg">10 The Eye sees not it selfe, and therefore hath need of the help of another.</NOTE> warned vs that the eye hath need with continu|all care to be obserued: for albeit it be a liuely Organe of sight, yet it sees not the owne selfe, and therefore hath neede to be helped with the counsell and custodie of another.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="118">Againe, God in Nature hath prouided a<NOTE PLACE="marg">11 The couering made by God for the eye warnes vs it should not be open to eue|ry obiect.</NOTE> couering for the eye, which with a meruailous volubilitie openeth and closeth at the pleasure of man; wherein the Lord who hath done all his workes in great wisedome, hath warned vs that it is expedient sometime the eye be closed, and not holden open to euery obiect.</P>
<P>There are two rules good to be obserued for<NOTE PLACE="marg">12 Two rules good for gouernment of the eye:</NOTE> the gouernment of our eyes: first, that before we open the bodily eye to looke to the creature, wee first open the eye of our minde, and looke<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first rule is, that wee looke to God before wee looke to the crea|ture.</NOTE> to the Creator, otherwise if wee looke to the creature before wee looke vnto God, wee shall assuredly be snared.</P>
<P>As God hath giuen vs an eye to see his<NOTE PLACE="marg">13 For as God hath giuen vs an eye to see his works, so an eye to see himselfe.</NOTE> workes, so hath hee giuen vs an eye whereby we may see himselfe: shall wee thinke hee will haue vs to looke to the Sunne, and not to him that made the Sunne? Let the eye that lookes to God, direct the eye that lookes to the crea|ture, and we shall looke out without danger.</P>
<P>It is said of <HI>Adam</HI> after his fall, that his eyes<NOTE PLACE="marg">14 How <HI>Adams</HI> eyes were opened after the fall.</NOTE> were opened; which is not so to be vnderstood as if they had beene closed before, but because where before all that hee saw was good: now his eyes were opened to see his euill which before he had not, and therefore could not see it.</P>
<P>And no better are the eyes wherein his mise|rable posteritie foolishly reioyceth; they haue
<PB N="213" REF="118">
eyes in some part to see their misery, the fruit<NOTE PLACE="marg">15 So are the eyes of his miserable poste|ritie.</NOTE> of their sinne: they haue eyes to looke to the baites of pleasure and profit, wherewith they are snared vnawares, but haue not eyes to looke vnto the Lord.</P>
<P>As the beasts in looking to other creatures<NOTE PLACE="marg">16 Man by nature loo|keth as the beast, regarding nothing but the belly.</NOTE> regard nothing but the commoditie of their belly: where they see any thing that may serue vnto it, they lay downe their heads; where not, they goe by it: so naturall men looke vnto the the creatures, seeking, <HI>vt addant aliquid ventri, non menti.</HI></P>
<P>Thus <HI>Euah</HI> looked to the apple, and thinking<NOTE PLACE="marg">17 As <HI>Euah</HI> conside|red no more in the apple but that it was good for meat.</NOTE> it good for meate, plucked it, but considered no more: so her children when they looke to the fowles that flie, to the fishes that swimme, to eue|ry good and pleasant creature in the kinde, of all they gather no other collection but they wish for their bellies sake it were in their hand.</P>
<P>Thus where the sight of Gods creatures<NOTE PLACE="marg">18 Creatures far abu|sed by naturall men to couetousnesse.</NOTE> should work in the heart of man a reuerence &amp; loue of God, a meditation of his goodnesse with thanksgiuing, it produceth onely an inordinate and sensuall couetousnesse of the creature.</P>

<P>The second rule for gouernment of our eyes<NOTE PLACE="marg">21 The second rule is that wee acquaint our eyes with tears, so shall they not be carryed away easily with vanitie.</NOTE> is, to acquaint them with pouring out of teares for the miseries which our sinnes haue brought vpon vs. The same eyes which God hath giuen vs for organes of our sight, hee hath also giuen vs for conduits of our teares&punc; therefore we see that in Nature children first mourne with their eyes, before they looke on any thing to delight in it.</P>
<P>Thus if the sight of the creature moued vs to<NOTE PLACE="marg">22 Euery creature pre|senteth to vs some matter of mourn|ing.</NOTE> mourne, as there is no creature which hath not in it a witnesse of that vanitie whereunto for our sinne it is subiect, it should not so readily be a snare vnto vs to entrap vs in sinne as it is.</P>

<P>But the wicked eye of that euill one, enuies<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Sathan makes man count it lawfull meat which God cals vnlawfull, or by the contrarie.</NOTE> that man should enioy this great goodnesse of God, and therefore as he tempts man to think that meat lawfull which God hath proclaimed to be vnlawfull, for so he did to our Parents in Paradice: so also he tempts man to count that meat vnlawfull, which God hath proclaimed to be lawfull, that so by one of two extremities, he may snare the consciences of men.</P>
<P>This is that Doctrine of diuels, so called by<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 Doctrine of Diuels defended by Pa|pists.</NOTE> the Apostle, which forbids to marrie, and commands to abstaine from meat, which God hath created to be receiued with thanks, 1. <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 4. and now is set out to the world by that

<P>First then in eating hee lookes vp to GOD, and receiues his meat with prayer and thanks|giuing, and that for two causes.</P>
<P>For hee knowes that man liues not by bread<NOTE PLACE="marg">7 For it is not bread but Gods blessing that maintains life.</NOTE> onely, but by euery word that commeth out of
<PB N="240" REF="132">
the mouth of God, and that it is not the meat, but the blessing of God that continues life: for if it were, then they who are best fed, would proue most liuely and healthfull: but we see the contrary by experience, that as <HI>Daniel</HI> grew better vpon his pottage, then the other chil|dren did on the Kings portion, so are poore la|borers more healthfull and liuely, then they who are more delicately nourished.</P>
<P>Againe, hee knoweth that in euery creature<NOTE PLACE="marg">8 In euery creature Sathan hath a snare therefore he eateth circumspectly.</NOTE> Sathan hath laid his secret snare to trappe him, and therefore doth hee eate circumspectly, so putting downe his hand and his head to those creatures which are beneath him, that hee also lifts vp his eyes and his heart to God who is aboue him: not vnlike to the watchfull Cock, of whom Naturalists write, that when with the one eye hee doth looke downe to his meate, with the other hee doth looke vpward, least any rauening Bird vnwares should come vpon him.</P>

<P>The third point of the Christians discreti|on<NOTE PLACE="marg">12 Thirdly, hee respe|cteth himselfe, eat|ing with content|ment &amp; temperance</NOTE> in eating, doth respect himselfe: if his por|tion be small, hee vseth it with contentment, hee doth know that God is the great steward of the whole familie, who giueth to euery one of his Children, their portion in due measure, as he knoweth to be meetest for them, and therefore will hee not murmure in any case.</P>

And as a Citie without wals is an easie pray to a stronger enemie, so is a man (saith <HI>Salomon</HI>) who cannot restraine his ap|petite.</P>

<P>To no Country hath God giuen all things,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4 Euery man hath something wherein he should worke.</NOTE> not to Canaan in her best estate: therfore when <HI>Salomon</HI> built the Temple, hee sent to Tirus for Timber, to Ophir for Gold: yea, to no man in the world hath God giuen all things,
<PB N="252" REF="138">
but hath so dispensed his gifts among men, that euery man should worke, one for the help of another.</P>
<P>The actions of the hands of a Christian are<NOTE PLACE="marg">5 The actions of a Christians hand are three.</NOTE> three: first, hee lifts them vp to God by prayer: secondly, he puts them downe to labour in his vocation: and thirdly, hee extendeth them to do the works of mercy and compassion toward the needy.</P>
<P>The first action of his hands is the lifting vp<NOTE PLACE="marg">6 The first is to lift them vp to God by prayer.</NOTE> of them to God by prayer, and that is a te|stimonie of the lifting vp of his heart: this he doth, because hee knoweth that all labour is vaine vnlesse the Lord blesse it. <HI>It is in vaine to</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 127. 2.</NOTE> <HI>rise earely, and to lie downe late, and to eate the bread of sorrow, the Lord will surely giue rest to his beloued.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Adam</HI> without the Lords command made a<NOTE PLACE="marg">7 For mans labour in any calling is no|thing without gods blessing.</NOTE> garment to himselfe, but it couered not his na|kednesse: <HI>Ionas</HI> made a booth, but it defended him not from the heat: <HI>Rahel</HI> sought children by artificial meanes, as the eating of Mandrakes; by naturall meanes, as copulation with her hus|band, but shee got none, till shee sought them from God by prayer: <HI>Peter</HI> fished all night and tooke nothing, but when Christ commanded him to cast in the net then he prospered.</P>
<P>On the other hand Prayer drawes downe a blessing vpon the workes of our hands. The
<PB N="253" REF="138">
marriage of <HI>Isaac</HI> could not but prosper, for <HI>A|braham</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">8 Actions begun and prosecuted with prayer cannot but prosper.</NOTE> in the beginning of it sought Gods bles|sing by prayer: <HI>Eliazer</HI> in procuring it, he vseth prayer: <HI>Rebecca</HI> her parents and brethren sent her away by prayer: and <HI>Isaac</HI> receiued her with Prayer. Thus our workes sanctified by prayer, shall prosper; and if wee call the Lord to the beginning of our actions, wee shall not faile to see his blessing vpon the end of them.</P>
<P>The second action of the hand is to worke<NOTE PLACE="marg">9 The second action is to worke with them in our calling</NOTE> in the lawfull trade and vocation whereunto God hath called vs. A lawfull trade I call that manner of life which is allowed in the word of God, and these are of diuers sorts: for God in his wisdome hath so distributed his gifts among men, that vnto none hath he giuen all, but hath made euery one to stand in neede of the help of another.</P>
<P>Religion then takes not away lawfull Trades<NOTE PLACE="marg">10 Religion takes not away lawfull trades and vocations.</NOTE> and vocations, but rather establisheth them. When those men of war asked <HI>Iohn</HI> the Baptist what they should do, they receiued this answer; <HI>doe violence to no man, neither accuse any falsly, and be content with your wages:</HI> he commanded them not to forsake their calling, but the cor|ruptions of their calling. Thus <HI>Cornelius</HI> after his conuersion to be a Christian, remained a Captaine: and if Religion take not away the
<PB N="254" REF="139">
calling of a Souldier, farre lesse are we to thinke it takes away other callings.</P>
<P>Onely it correcteth the abuses of the cal|ling,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11 Onely it corrects the abuses of them.</NOTE> whereby men adde to the good ordinance of God, the deceit of Sathan: vsing a lawfull cal|ling in an vnlawfull manner as when the mer|chant in making of his merchandise vseth de|ceitfull ballances, or weights of a double mea|sure. As indeed there is no calling in the world so good, which hath not the owne worme to corrupt it.</P>
<P>The third action of the hand is to stretch<NOTE PLACE="marg">12 The third action is to stretch them out to the poore.</NOTE> out, and giue to the poore. It is true of all the godly, which <HI>Salomon</HI> saith of the godly wo|man; <HI>She stretcheth out her hand to the wheele, and then shee stretcheth out her hand to the poore:</HI> for after that God hath increased them in their lawfull calling, then of their aboundance they giue to the needie.</P>
<P>The Lord hath made some of his children<NOTE PLACE="marg">13 Why God hath made some rich, others poore.</NOTE> rich in worldly things, and others hee hath made poore, that the one should be examples of mercy, the other patternes of patience in his Church.</P>
<P>Vnder the Law God fore-warned Israel, that<NOTE PLACE="marg">14 As we take from God so should we giue to the poore.</NOTE> the poore should euer be with them, and our Sauiour hath sore-warned vs of the same vnder the Gospell: and therewith the commadement is giuen; <HI>With-draw not therefore thine hand</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 15. 7.</NOTE>
<PB N="255" REF="139">
<HI>from thy needie brother.</HI> For this cause was it inioyned to the Israelite in the time of haruest that hee should leaue a part of his cornes stand|ing in the fields, that the poore might take it; teaching vs that as wee haue a hand willingly to take from the Lord: so we are bound to open it, and liberally giue to the poore.</P>
<P>For this liberalitie to the indigent and nee|die<NOTE PLACE="marg">15 Liberalitie toward the needie recom|mended by the ex|ample of God.</NOTE> is recommended to vs both by the example of God himselfe, and of his most excellent crea|tures. The goodnesse of God is extended to all, hee makes his Sunne to shine, and his raine to fall, euen vpon those which are vniust; teaching vs not to neglect, farre lesse to contemne other men, who are Gods creatures, euen then, when for their euill qualities, wee may make iust ex|ception against them, that so wee may be the children of our heauenly father.</P>
<P>And as for the creatures of God we see that<NOTE PLACE="marg">16 And of his crea|tures.</NOTE> as they excel in goodnes, so they communicate their good vnto others. <HI>Omne enim bonum est communicatiuum sui.</HI></P>
<P>The Sunne keepeth not his light to himselfe<NOTE PLACE="marg">17 Specially of the Sunne, Cloudes, Trees, yea and of the Angels.</NOTE> but sends out his beames to giue light and heat to the world&punc; the Cloudes when they are full drop downe their raine to the earth: the Trees of thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> owne accord lets fall their fruit to the vse of man, albeit no man doth require it: yea, the Angels doe delight to Minister vnto our

necessities, for why is Manna wherewith God fed Israel in the wildernesse, called Angels food? surely not because the Angels did eyther make or eate it, but were onely the stewards of God to conuay it to his people.</P>
<P>Thus are we taught that it is a more blessed<NOTE PLACE="marg">18 A more blessed thing to giue then to receiue.</NOTE> thing to giue then to receiue, if eyther we will follow the Lord, or his most excellent crea|tures in heauen and earth.</P>
<P>But strange it is to see how many wretched<NOTE PLACE="marg">19 Worldlings liue like monsters of the earth.</NOTE> worldlings there are like vnto <HI>Nabal,</HI> monsters of the earth, liuing so in it, as if their mouthes were wide enough for all Gods creatures, and whatsoeuer were giuen them, were giuen them for themselues onely.</P>
<P>Or like that cursed gulfe in the salt and dead<NOTE PLACE="marg">20 Compared to the lake of Sodome.</NOTE> sea, which swalloweth vp the whole riuer of Iordan into her bosome, and is neither her selfe bettered thereby, neyther yet sends out any part thereof againe to the good of others: such cursed creatures are they who receiue good things from God in great abundance, and are neyther changed by them in themselues, ney|ther yet will suffer any of those goods to flow from them to the benefit of others; their bar|raine hearts hauing caused to them withered hands which are able to giue nothing.</P>
<P>Or if at any time they giue, it is as if their right hand should giue vnto their left, that is,
<PB N="257" REF="140">
they giue to their owne onely. Or as if the<NOTE PLACE="marg">21 If worldlings giue they are like clouds powring raine on the Sea.</NOTE> Cloudes being full of raine and standing ouer some thirstie ground should be carryed away by the winde to disburthen her treasures of water in the Sea: so doe they while all they giue is bestowed on such as haue more then them|selues, and that vnder hope of a greater benefit to returne to themselues againe.</P>
<P>To moue vs therefore to the performance<NOTE PLACE="marg">22 Motiues to almes giuing.</NOTE> of this christian dutie, wee will shortly consider the losse that comes by neglect thereof, and the great vantage by the faithfull discharge of it.</P>
<P>The losse is euident; if wee will keepe that<NOTE PLACE="marg">23 He which keepes that which God bids giue doth lose it.</NOTE> which God bids vs giue, be sure wee shall lose it.

<P>And this shall yet appeare more clearely, if<NOTE PLACE="marg">27 This is manifested by the example of the widdow and <HI>Elijah.</HI></NOTE> we consider the example of <HI>Elijah</HI> and the wid|dow of Sarepta: the Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ed his Prophet some|time by Angels, sometime by Rauens, and so hee might haue done still all the time of the fa|mine; but it pleased him to change his steward, and to send him to the widdow of Sarepta, not so much that <HI>Elijah</HI> should be nourished by the widdow, whom before without her hee had nourished, as that the widdowes portion might be blessed by <HI>Elijah.</HI></P>
<P>Thus is it true that the giuer of almes if hee<NOTE PLACE="marg">28 What vantage hee reapes who rightly giueth almes.</NOTE> giue it rightly, gets more then he giues, as <HI>A|braham</HI> and <HI>Lot</HI> gaue perishing meate, but re|ceiued immortall Angels. <HI>Plus pauper tibi con|fert, quam &agrave; te accipit;</HI> the poor giues thee more<NOTE PLACE="marg">Amb. ossic. lib. 1 cap. 30.</NOTE> then hee gets from thee, said <HI>Ambrose.

<HEAD>THE OBSERVATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>IT was the most ancient glory of man, that hee was made to the Image of God, and it
<PB N="263" REF="143">
will be his last and his greatest glory to be re|stored<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Mans first and last glory is to haue the Image of God.</NOTE> again to this same image, without which the most excellent Monarches of the world are most inglorious.</P>
<P>For it is a most fearefull thing to remember<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 How miserable are they who shall be found to want gods Image.</NOTE> that they who want the Image of God, God shall denie them to be his Creatures: Depart from me, I know you not ye workers of iniqui|tie; ye are not that which I made you; I plan|ted you a noble Vine, whose plants were all na|turall, how is it then that ye are turned vnto me<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ierem. 2. 21.</NOTE> in the plants of a strange Vine?</P>
<P>Deceitfull Sathan stole away this glorious<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 Sathan first and last enuieth this I|mage of God in man.</NOTE> Image from our first Parents, and as craftily laboureth he to steale from their children that second blessing of the Gospell, by which the Lord Iesus offers to restore that Image againe vnto vs. And therfore what vniustly <HI>Esau</HI> spake of <HI>Iacob,</HI> may most iustly be spoken of him, <HI>hee is a supplanter indeed,</HI> a Sathan, an aduersary: oh that we could take it more deeply into our hearts, and so arme our selues against him as against the first and last most deadly enemie of our saluation.</P>
<P>As other members of the body are refor|med<NOTE PLACE="marg">4 The grace of rege|neration teacheth vs also how to go|uerne our feet.</NOTE> and employed to the right vse by the grace of regeneration: so the feet also which God hath giuen to carry man to and fro vpon earth, <HI>Salomon</HI> calleth them <HI>The strong men:</HI> for they<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccles. 12. 3.</NOTE>
<PB N="264" REF="144">
are as pillers vpholding the whole body, and car|rying man most easily whither hee would goe.</P>
<P>They are basest in the body, but very arti|ficially<NOTE PLACE="marg">5 The feet of man ar|tificially made by God.</NOTE> made, consisting of fortie and foure bones: whereof one is in the heele, as the soc|ket of the piller; another in the palme of the foote, from thence one proceeding from side to side to euery toe; and then in euery toe three bones, meruailously knit together for the nim|bler mouing and surer fastning of the steps of<NOTE PLACE="marg">6 That in the basest part of his body, man might haue cause to praise God</NOTE> man.</P>
<P>So that if man did consider himselfe in the basest part of his body, euen in the feete, by which he treads vpon clay and doung, as oft as hee did looke to himselfe, he would glorifie his Maker, saying with the Psalmist, <HI>I am fearefully</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">7 But by nature the canker of sin hath run from the heart to the feet also.</NOTE> <HI>and wondrously made. Psal.</HI> 139.</P>
<P>But what is there so good giuen vnto man by God, which sinne hath not infected: the poi|son thereof beginning at the soule hath runne like a canker through the whole body, so that from the toppe of the head to the sole of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">8 For naturally mans feet are impotent to good.</NOTE> foot, there is nothing sound in man.</P>
<P>For by Nature the feet of man are impotent and vnable to walk in the good way which God hath commanded: like that cripple of Lystra, born lame of his feet from the womb, who could not walke till the Apostle in the name of Iesus
<PB N="265" REF="144">
cured him, so is euery man till the grace of Christ renue him.</P>
<P>They are nimble inough to walke in the<NOTE PLACE="marg">9 But nimble inough and able to euill.</NOTE> wayes of sinne: yea, as the horse rusheth into&punc; the battell, so can naturall men make hast with their feet to runne their owne way; their feete are swift to the shedding of blood, but in the end they are recompensed with a fearefull iudge|ment: for as they delight to wander from the Lord, so the Lord hath no delight in them. <HI>Ier.</HI> 14. 10. and because now they lose their feet to euery way of wickednesse, God in the end shall binde them hand and foote, and cast them into vtter darknesse.</P>
<P>But the grace of regeneration teacheth the<NOTE PLACE="marg">10 The Christian by regeneration re|ceiues the right vse of them.</NOTE> Christian how to walke with his feet, to the do|ing of good, and declyning from euill. <HI>My feete</HI> (saith <HI>Iob</HI> 23. 11.) <HI>hath followed the steppes of the Lord, and not declyned.</HI></P>
<P>As a seruant walking at the backe of his Ma|ster<NOTE PLACE="marg">11 For he walkes after God, as a seruant after his Master.</NOTE> hath his eye vpon him to follow his steps, and to turne where hee turnes: so the Christian walkes with the Lord, as <HI>Henoch</HI> did, and refu|seth to goe any way wherein his Master hath not gone before him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">12 And therefore de|lights to haunt those places where|in most frequently his Master appeares that is, holy assem|blies.</NOTE></P>
<P>And because his Master is in heauen, and himselfe on earth, hee waites most diligently on his Master in those places of earth wherein most frequently hee appeares, that is, in the
<PB N="266" REF="145">
assembly of Gods Saints in his holy Temples, for those are the places vpon earth which are most like vnto heauen.</P>
<P>Moreouer, because with his feete he treads<NOTE PLACE="marg">13 With his feete hee treads vpon earth but vvith his face he looke&punc; to heauen</NOTE> vpon earth, and with his face lookes vp to hea|uen; hee delighteth not much in those workes by which the earth may be gained, but rather in those by which the great and excellent glory of heauen may be obtayned; for euen by this that God hath made him to tread vpon the earth, he learnes to despise the earth, counting the best things that are in it but dongue, in re|spect of the Lord Iesus.</P>
<P>The Church is described hauing the Sunne<NOTE PLACE="marg">14 So the vvhole Church is described hauing the World vnder her feete.</NOTE> and the twelue starres on her head: for Christ and the doctrine of the Apostles is as a Diadem of beauty to her, the Moone figuring the world, shee hath vnder her feete: it is a shame to alter this order, as carnall men doe, who tread Christ and his word vnder their feete, and putteth the world as a garland vpon their heads: but the Christian will neuer place that in his hart, nor vpon his head, which God hath placed vnder his feete.</P>
<P>Thus, while as hee walketh vpon the earth<NOTE PLACE="marg">15 Thus vvalking on earth hee keepes an heauenly minde.</NOTE> with his feete, hee keepes within him an hea|uenly minde, and so ordereth his wayes as may best serue to prepare a way for his ascension to his Lord.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="145">For in all the wayes wherein he goes he look|eth<NOTE PLACE="marg">16 For in all his vvayes he lookes eyther to Gods command or his license.</NOTE> eyther to Gods commandement or his li|cense: if he goe to a worke which is absolutely good, as to heare the Word, to visit the sicke, to giue almes to the poore, his feet moue therto with cheerfulnesse, being surely warranted by Gods commandement. If otherwise he be to go to a work which is indifferent, such as is his bo|dily recreation by honest game, he wil not moue his foot vnto it, till first in his conscience hee be sure of license obtained from his Lord.</P>
<P>But in all this let the Christian remember,<NOTE PLACE="marg">17 Sathans snares laid in all his vvayes.</NOTE> how he is greatly enuied by Sathan, who in all his wayes hath spread out deceiueable snares, wherein to trap him; <HI>Psal.</HI> 57. at least to make him if he can, stumble and fall.</P>
<P>Therefore first of all hath the Christian need<NOTE PLACE="marg">18 Against vvhich the Christian armeth himselfe vvith pray|er &amp; consideration.</NOTE> to pray continually, that the Lord who keepeth the feet of his Saints, would saue him from the snare of his enemie. Secondly, hee hath conti|nuall need in all his wayes to walke circum|spectly. As hee that walketh among thornes setteth not downe his foot without considera|tion: so the Christian seeing in euery step there is a snare, should take diligent heed to all his wayes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">19 Seeing vve looke to tread Sathan vnder our feet, let vs not pollute them.</NOTE></P>
<P>And herewith all let the Christian ioyne these meditations. Seeing thou lookest at length to be partaker of this glory of the Saints, that
<PB N="268" REF="146">
Sathan shall be trodden vnder thy feet, suffer him not to pollute thy feet, nor to vse them at his will, which thou hopest against his will at length to set on his neck.</P>
<P>Againe, seeing all the workes of Gods hand<NOTE PLACE="marg">20 God hath honored vs by subduing all his vvorkes vnder our feet, let vs not dishonour them.</NOTE> are put vnder thy feet againe by Christ Iesus, in whom thou art restored to thy Lord-ship and superioritie ouer them; dishonor not thy selfe so farre as to make them seruants to Sathan, by running at his will into the workes of vn|cleannesse.</P>
<P>And last of all, remember that our blessed<NOTE PLACE="marg">21 In that our Sauiour once vvashed his Disciples feet it vvas to teach vs all to vse our feet in holi|nesse and humility.</NOTE> Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ did once wash the feete of his owne Disciples, not onely to teach all his seruants humilitie, but holinesse also: for it is a great shame for vs to pollute and disho|nour those parts of our body, which were so greatly honoured by the Lord.</P>

<P>NEyther in this life nor in the life to come,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Man by creation made a sociall crea|ture.</NOTE> hath God ordained man to liue alone.

<P>Others there are who are moued to keepe<NOTE PLACE="marg">10 Some by similitude of manners.</NOTE> company by the similitude of manners, and these are of two sorts: some are conioyned and linkt together by the similitude of their euill manners: so were <HI>Simion</HI> and <HI>Leui</HI> brethren in euill; and <HI>Herod</HI> and <HI>Pilate</HI> made friends by their mutuall medling with an euill cause.

<P>But the similitude of good manners is the<NOTE PLACE="marg">11 Similitude of good manners is the sure|est band of friend|ship.</NOTE> surest bond of friendship: and it is by this sure marke that true Christians doe make choise of their companions; for hee loueth another for the grace of God that hee sees in him.

man neuer so wise, if hee be not godly, it is great wisedome to eschew him: <HI>Quis enim v|tilem causae alt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">nae iudicet, quem videt inutilem</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Amb. offic. lib. 2 cap. 12.</NOTE> <HI>vitae suae.</HI></P>
<P>It is one of the continuall cares of a Chri|stian<NOTE PLACE="marg">12 A Christian flyeth the companie of the wicked for feare of the euill they may doe him.</NOTE> to slie from euill company: first, for feare of the euill the wicked may doe to him: for the nature of things is such, that when good is ioyned with the euill, the good is sooner cor|rupted by the euill, then the euill is rectified by the good.</P>
<P>And this the Spirit of God doth teach vs<NOTE PLACE="marg">13 How dangerous their company is in the iudgement of Gods spirit.</NOTE> both by significant Phrases, and cleare exam|ples: Can a man take fire in his bosome, and walke vpon coales and not be burnt? Canst thou be a brother to Dragons, and com|panion to Ostriches, and not sauour of their wildnesse?</P>
<P>How often haue men of most excellent<NOTE PLACE="marg">14 Men of excellent graces haue beene hurt by the compa|ny of the wicked.</NOTE> Graces, and singular vertues beene snared by the Companie of the wicked. In the Court of Egypt, <HI>Ioseph</HI> was snared to sweare by the life of <HI>Pharaoh:</HI> In the companie of the Phi|listims godly <HI>Dauid</HI> was drawne to be a dis|sembler, and was forced to shew himselfe in armes against Israel, though sore against his heart: In the Hall of <HI>Caiaphas</HI> the Apostle Saint <HI>Peter</HI> was tempted to denie his Lord and Maister. Yea, as <HI>Nazianzen</HI> did warne
<PB N="278" REF="151">
<HI>Caesarius,</HI> the least euill wee doe incurre by keeping company with the wicked, we are blackt with their smoake, if we be not burnt with their fire.</P>
<P>Neyther doth the Christian slye the compa|nie<NOTE PLACE="marg">15 A Christian also slies the company of the wicked for feare least he doe them euill.</NOTE> of the wicked, for feare of the euill they may doe to him onely, but also for feare hee doe euill vnto them: for wicked men, when they see that godly men doe not abhorre their company, are so much the more strengthened and confirmed to proceede on forward in their sinnes.</P>
<P>Finally, the Christian in ioyning himselfe<NOTE PLACE="marg">16 A Christians re|spect in all compa|nie is first to doe good.</NOTE> to any company, doth euer keepe this two|fold respect: first, to doe good if hee may: secondly, to get good.

<P>His second respect in haunting companie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">17 Secondly, to get good.</NOTE> is to get good: and therefore his delight is in the fellowship of the Saints of God. He know|eth that grapes cannot be gathered of thornes, nor sigges of Thistles: hee hath an eye to

<P>_FEW and euill haue beene the dayes of my pilgri|mage. <HI>Gen.</HI> 49. 7. I haue had as inheritance the moneths of vanitie, and painfull nights haue been appointed vnto me. <HI>Iob.</HI> 7. 3. And I know that hereafter there is laid vp for me a crowne of righteousnesse, and not for
<PB N="281" REF="152">
me onely, but for all them, who loue the ap|pearing of the Lord Iesus. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 8. There|fore all the dayes of my life will I waite till my changing shall come: <HI>Iob.</HI> 14. 14. For I desire to be dissolued and to be with Christ. <HI>Philip.</HI> 1. I loue to remoue out of the body, and to dwell with the Lord: 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 8. For I know if this earthly house of this taberna|cle were destroyed, I haue a building giuen of God, that is, an house not made with hands, but eternall in the heauens: therefore I sigh, desiring to be clothed with mine house which is from heauen. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. And I heartilie looke for, and doe hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all confidence, Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life or by death: <HI>Philip.</HI> 1. 20. For whe|ther I liue, I liue to the Lord; or whether I die, I dye to the Lord: whether therefore I liue or I dye, I am the Lords. <HI>Rom.</HI> 14. 8. To him therefore be praise and glory for e|uer.</P>

<HEAD>His willing Resolution in the <HI>houre of death.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Haue foughten a good fight, I haue kept the Faith: 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. I know whom I haue beleeued, and I am perswaded that hee is able to keepe that which I haue credited vnto him against that day. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1. 12. The Lord will quicken my mortall body, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. and make it like to his owne glorious body: <HI>Philip.</HI> 3. 20. Yea, though after my skinne wormes destroy this body, yet shall I see God in my flesh, whom I my selfe shall see, and mine eyes shall be|hold, and none other for mee: though my reynes be consumed within me: <HI>Iob.</HI> 19. 26. therefore I willingly lay downe my life and commit my soule vnto God, as vnto my faith|full Creator. 1. <HI>Pet.</HI> 4. 19.</P>

<HEAD>The Christians last prayer made in the body.</HEAD>
<P>HOW excellent is thy mercy O God: therefore doe I trust vnder the shadow of thy wings. <HI>Psal. 36. 7.</HI> O blessed is the man whom thou dost choose, and causest to come vnto thee, he shall dwell in thy Courts, and shall be satisfied with the plea|sures of thine house, euen of thy holy Temple: <HI>Psal. 65. 4.</HI> Thou shalt giue him drinke out of the riuers of thy pleasures: for with thee is the well of life, and in thy light shall wee see light. <HI>Psal. 36.</HI> Send out therefore thy light and thy truth, <HI>Psal. 43. 3.</HI> and let thy good spirit lead me vnto the Land of righteousnesse. <HI>Psal. 143. 10.</HI> Carry mee O Lord, by thy mercy, and bring me in thy strength to thy holy habitation: plant me in the mountaine of thine inheritance, euen the place which thou hast prepared, and the sanctuary which thou hast stablished. <HI>Exod. 15. 3.</HI> that I may see the good|nesse of the Lord in the land of the liuing. <HI>Psal. 27. 13.</HI> Turne away my soule from the pit, and illuminate it in the light of the liuing. <HI>Iob. 33. 30.</HI> Let me behold thy face in righteousnesse, and let
<PB N="284" REF="154">
me be satisfied with thine Image: <HI>Psal. 17. 15.</HI> For in thy presence is the fulnesse of ioy, and at thy right hand are pleasures for euermore. <HI>Psal. 16. 9.</HI> Into thine hands O Lord I commend my spirit, for thou hast redeemed mee O Lord God of truth. <HI>Psal. 31. 5.</HI> Lord Iesus receiue my spirit. <HI>Act. 7.</HI></P>
<Q>The end of the vpright man is peace.</Q>
