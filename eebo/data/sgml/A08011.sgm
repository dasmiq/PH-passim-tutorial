<HEAD>To the most copious Carminist of our time, and famous persecutor of <HI>Priscian,</HI> his verie friend Maister <HI>Apis lapis: Tho. Nash</HI> wish|eth new strings to his old tawnie Purse, and all honourable increase of acquain|tance in the Cellar.</HEAD>
<P>_GEntle M. <HI>William,</HI> that learned writer <HI>Rhenish wine &amp; Sugar,</HI> in the first booke of his Comment vpon <HI>Red-noses</HI> hath this saying: <HI>veterem ferendo iniuriam inui|tas nouam,</HI> which is as much in English, as one Cuppe of nipitaty puls on another. In moyst considera|tion wherof as also in zealous regard of that <HI>high</HI> coun|tenance you shew vnto Schollers, I am bolde in steade of new Wine, to carowse to you a cuppe of newes: which if your worship (according to your wonted <HI>Chaucerisme</HI>) shall accept in good part, Ile be your daily Orator to pray that, that pure sanguine complexion of yours may neuer be famisht with potte-lucke, that you may tast till your last gaspe, and liue to see the confusion of both your speci|all enemies, Small Beere and Grammer rules.</P>
<P>It is not vnknowne to report, what a famous potle-pot Patron you haue beene to olde Poets in your daies, &amp; how many pounds you haue spent (and as it were throwne into the fire) vpon <HI>the durt of wisedome, called Alcumie:</HI>
<PB REF="3">
Yea&punc; you are such an infinite <HI>Mecaenas</HI> to learned men, that there is not that morsell of meat they can carue you, but you will eate for their sakes and accept very thanke|fully. Thinke not though vnder correction of your boone-companionship, I am disposd to be a little pleasant, I con|demne you of anie immoderation either in eating or drin|king, for I know your gouernement and carriage to bee e|uerie way Canonicall. Verilie, verilie all poore Schollers acknowledge you as their patron, prouiditore, and suppor|ter, for there cannot a threedbare Cloake sooner peepe forth, but you strait presse it to bee an outbrother of your bountie, three decaied Students you kept attending vpon you a long time.</P>
<P>Shall I presume to dilate of the grauitie of your round cap and your dudgion dagger? It is thught they wil make you be cald vpon shortly to be Alderman of the Stilliard. And thats well remembred, I heard saie when this last Terme was remooued to <HI>Hartford,</HI> you fell into a greate studie and care by your selfe, to what place the Stilliard should be remooued: I promise you truelie it was a deepe meditation, &amp; such as might well haue beseemed <HI>Elder|tons</HI> parliament of noses to haue sit vpon.</P>
<P>A Tauerne in London, onelie vpon the motion mour|ned al in blacke, and forbare to girt hir temples with iuie, because the grandame of good fellowship was like to de|part from among them. And I wonder verie much, that you <HI>sampsownd</HI> not your selfe into a consumption with the profound cogitation of it.</P>
<P><HI>Di&ugrave; viuas in amore ioc&iacute;sque,</HI> whatsoeuer you do, be|ware of keeping diet. Sloth is a sinne, and one sinne (as one poison) must be expelled with another. What can he doe better that hath nothing to do, than fal a drinking to keep
<PB REF="3">
him from idlenesse?</P>
<P>Fah, me thinks my ieasts begin alreadie to smell of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aske, with talking so much of this liquid prouinder.</P>
<P>In earnest thus; There is a <HI>Doctor and his Fart,</HI> that haue kept a foule stinking stirre in Paules Churchyard; I crie him mercie I sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">undered him, he is scarse a Doctor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ll he hath done his Acts: this dodipoule, this didopper, this professed poetical braggart, hath raild vpon me with out w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t or art, in certaine foure penniworth of Letters, and three farthing-worth of Sonnets; now do I meane to present him and <HI>Shakerley</HI> to the Queens foole-taker for coatch-horses: for two that draw more equallie in one O|ratoriall yoke of vaine-glorie there is not vnder heauen.</P>
<P>What saie you Maister <HI>Apis lapis,</HI> will you with your eloquence and credit shield me from carpers? Haue you anie odde shreds of Latine to make this letter-mungera cockscombe of?</P>
<P>It stands you in hande to arme your selfe against him; for he speaks against Connicatchers, and you are a Conni|catcher, as Connicatching is diuided into three parts; the <HI>Verser,</HI> the <HI>Setter,</HI> and the <HI>Barnacle.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Setter</HI> I am sure you are not; for you are no Musi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ian: nor a <HI>Barnacle;</HI> for you neuer were of the order of the Barnardines: but the <HI>Verser</HI> I cannot acquite you of; for M. <HI>Vaux</HI> of <HI>Lambeth</HI> brings in sore euidence of a breakefast you wonne of him one morning at an vnlawful game cald riming. What lies not in you to amend plaie the <HI>Doctor</HI> and defend.</P>
<P>A fellow that I am to talke with by and by being told that his Father was a Rope-maker, excused the matter after this sort; <HI>And hath neuer saint had reprobate to his Father?</HI> They are his owne wordes, hee cannot goe

from them. You see heere hee makes a <HI>Reprobate</HI> and a <HI>Ropemaker, voces conuertibiles.</HI> Go too, take example by him to wash out durt with inke, and run vp to the knees in the channell, if you bee once wet shod. You are amongst graue Doctors, and men of iudgement in both Lawes e|uerie daie, I pray aske them the question in my absence, whether such a man as I haue describ'd this <HI>Epistler</HI> to be, one that hath a good handsome picker deuant, and a prettie leg to studie the Ciuill Law with, that hath made many proper rimes of the olde cut in his daies, and deser|ued infinitely of the state by extolling himselfe and his two brothers in euerie booke he writes: whether (I saie) such a famous piller of the Presse, now in the fourteenth or fifteenth yeare of the raigne of his Rhetorike, giuing mony to haue this his illiterat Pamphlet of Letters prin|ted (whereas others haue monie giuen them to suffer them selues to come in Print) it is not to bee counted as flat si|monie, and be liable to one and the same penaltie.</P>
<P>I tell you, I meane to trounce him after twentie in the hundred and haue about with him with two staues and a pike for this geare.</P>
<P>If he get any thing by the bargaine, lette what soeuer I write hence-forward bee condemned to wrappe bumbast in.</P>
<P>Carouse to me good lucke&punc; for I am resolutely bent; the best bloud of the brothers shall pledge me in vineger. O would thou hadst a quaffing boule, which like <HI>Gawens</HI> scull should containe a pecke, that thou mightst swappe off a hartie draught to the successe of this voiage.</P>
<P>By what soeuer thy visage holdeth most pretious I be|seech thee, by <HI>Iohn Dauies</HI> soule, and the blew Bore in the Spittle I coniure thee, to draw out thy purse, and giue me

nothing for the dedication of my Pamphlet.</P>
<P>Thou art a good fellow I know, and hadst rather spend ieasts than monie. Let it be the taske of thy best tearmes, to safeconduct this booke through the enemies countrey.</P>

<HEAD>To the Gentlemen Readers.</HEAD>
<P>_GEntlemen, the strong fayth you haue conceiu'd, that I would do workes of su|pererrogation in answering the Doctor, hath made mee breake my daye with o|ther important busines I had, and stand darting of quils a while like the Porpentine.</P>
<P>I know there want not welwillers to my disgrace, who say my onely Muse is contention; and other, that with <HI>Tiberius Caesar</HI> pretending to see in the darke, talke of strange obiectes by them discouered in the night, when in truth they are nothing else but the glimmering of their eies.</P>
<P>I will not holde the candle to the Deuill, vnmaske my holiday Muse to enuie; but if any such deepe in|sighted detracter, will challenge mee to whatsoeuer quiet aduenture of Art wherein he thinkes mee least conuersant, hee shall finde that I am <HI>Tam Mercurio qu&agrave;m Marti,</HI> a Scholler in some thing else but con|tention.</P>
<P>If idle wittes will needes tye knottes on smooth bulrushes with their tongues, faith the worlde might thinke I had little to attend, if I should goe about to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nloose them with my penne.</P>
<P><PB REF="5">I cannot tell how it comes to passe but in these ill cide daies of ours, euery man delights with <HI>Ixion</HI> to beget children of clouds, digge for Pearles in dung|hils, and wrest oyle out of iron.</P>
<P>Poore <HI>Pierce Pennilesse,</HI> haue they turnd to a con|iuring booke, for there is not that line in it, with which they doo not seeke to raise vp a Ghost, and like the hog that conuerts the sixth part of his meate into bristels, so haue they conuerted sixe parts of my booke into bitternes.</P>
<P><HI>Aretine</HI> in a Commedie of his, wittily complai|neth that vpstart Commenters, with their Annotati|ons and gloses, had extorted that sense and Morall out of <HI>Petrarch,</HI> which if <HI>Petrarch</HI> were aliue a hun|dred Strappadoes might not make him confesse or subscribe too; So may I complaine that rash heads, vpstart Interpreters, haue extorted &amp; rakte that vn|reuerent meaning out of my lines, which a thousand deaths cannot make mee ere grant that I dreamd off.</P>
<P>To them that are abused by their owne iealous collections and no determined trespasse of mine, this aduice by the way of example will I giue.</P>
<P>One comming to Doctour <HI>Perne</HI> on a time, and telling him hee was miserably raild on such a day in a Sermon at Saint Maries in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> I but quoth he (in his puling manner of speaking) did he name me, did he name me, I warrant you goe and aske him, and hee will say hee meant not mee; So they that are vn|groundedly offended at any thing in <HI>Pierce Penni|lesse,</HI> first let them looke if I did name them; if not, but the matter hangeth in suspence, let them send to mee for my exposition, and not buy it at the seconde hand, and I doe not doubt but they will be through|ly satisfied.</P>
<P><PB REF="6">Hee that wraps himselfe in earth like the Foxe, to catch birds, may haps haue a heauy cart go ouer him before he be aware, and breake his backe.</P>
<P>A number of Apes may get the glowworme in the night, and thinke to kindle fire with it, because it gli|sters so, but God wote they are beguiled it proues in the end to be but fools fire, the poore worme alone with their blowing is warmed, they starud for colde whiles their wood is vntoucht. Who but a Foppe wil labour to anatomize a Flye? Fables were free for any bondman to speake in old time, as <HI>Aesope</HI> for an in|stance, their allusion was not restrained to any parti|cular humor of spite, but generally applyed to a ge|nerall vice. Now a man may not talke of a dog, but it is surmised he aimes at him that giueth the dog in his Crest, hee cannot name straw, but hee must plucke a wheate sheaffe in pieces, <HI>Iutelligendo faciunt vt nihil intelligant.</HI></P>
<P>VVhat euer they be that thus persecute Art (as the Alcumists are said to persecute Nature) I would wish them to rebate the edge of their wit, and not grinde their colours so harde, hauing founde that which is blacke, let them not with our forenamed Gold-falsi|fiers, seeke for a substance that is blacker than black; or angle for frogs in a cleare fountaine.</P>
<P>From the admonition of these vncurteous miscon|sterers. I come to <HI>The kilcow champion of the three bre|thren</HI>; he forsooth wil be the first that shal giue <HI>Pierce Penilesse a non placet.</HI></P>
<P>It is not inough that hee bepist his credite about twelue yeeres ago, with <HI>Three proper and wittie fami|liar letters,</HI> but still he must be running on the <HI>letter,</HI> and abusing the Queenes English without pittie or mercie.</P>
<P><PB REF="6">Bee it knowne vnto you (Christian Readers) this man is a forestaller of the market of fame, an ingrosser of glorie, a mounte bancke of strange wordes, a meere marchant of babies and conny-skins.</P>
<P>Hold vp thy hand <HI>G.

<P>I say no more but Lord haue mercie vpon thee, for thou art falne into his hands that will plague thee.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, will you be instructed in the quarrell that hath causd him lay about him with his penne and inckehorne so couragiously. About two yeeres since (a fatall time to familiar Epistles) a certayne Theologicall gimpanado, a demie diuine, no higher than a Tailors pressing iron, brother to this huge booke-beare, that writes himselfe <HI>One of the Empe|rour Iustinians Courtiers,</HI> tooke vppon him to set his foote to mine, and ouer-crow mee with comparatiue tearmes. I protest I neuer turnd vp any cowsheard to looke for this scarabe flye. I had no conceit as then of discouering a breed of fooles in the three brothers bookes: marry when I beheld ordinance planted on edge of the pulpit against me, &amp; that there was no re|medy but the blind Vicar would needs let flie at me with his Churchdore keies, &amp; curse me with bel, book and candle, because in my Alphabet of Idiots I had
<PB REF="7">
ouer-skipt the Hs, what could I doe but draw vppon him with my penne, and defende my selfe with it and a paper buckler as well as I might.</P>
<P>Say I am as verie a Turke as hee that three yeeres ago ranne vpon ropes, if euer I speld eyther his or a|nie of his kindreds name in reproch, before hee barkt against mee as one of the enemies of the Lambe of God, and fetcht allusions out of the Buttery to de|base mee.</P>
<P>Heere beginneth the fray. I vpbraid godly predi|cation with his wicked conuersation, I squirt inke in|to his decayed eyes with iniquitie to mend their dis|eased sight, that they may a little better descend into my schollership and learning. The Ecclesiastical dun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> instead of recouery waxeth starke blind thereby (as a preseruatiue to some, is poyson to others) hee gets an olde Fencer his brother to be reuengd on me for my Phi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">icke; who flourishing about my eares with his two hand sworde of Oratory and Poetry, peraduen|ture shakes some of the rust of it on my shoulders, but otherwise strikes mee not but with the shadowe of it, which is no more than a flappe with the false scabberd of contumelie: whether am I in this case to arme my selfe against his intent of iniurie, or sitte still with my finger in my mouth, in hope to bee one of simplicities martyrs.</P>
<P>A quest of honorable minded Caualiers go vppon it, and if they shall find by the Law of armes or of ale, that I beeing first prouokt, am to bee inioynde to the peace, or be sworne true seruant to cowardize &amp; pa|tience, when wrong presseth mee to the warres; then wil I bind my selfe prentise to a Cobler, and fresh vn|derlay all those writings of mine that haue trodde a|wrie.</P>
<P><PB REF="7">Be aduertised (gentle audience) that the <HI>Doctors</HI> proceedings haue thrust vpon mee this sowterly Me|taphor, who first contriuing his confutation in a short Pamphlet of six leaues like a paire of summer pumps: afterward (winter growing on) clapt a paire of dou|ble soales on it like a good husband, added eight sheets more, and prickt those sheets or soales as full of the hob-nayles of reprehension as they could sticke.</P>
<P>It is not those his new clowted startopsiwis, that shall carry him out of the durt.</P>
<P>Sweet Gentlemen, be but indifferent, and you shal see mee desperate. Heere lies my hatte, and there my cloake, to which I resemble my two Epistles, being the vpper garments of my booke, as the other of my body: Saint Fame for mee, and thus I runne vpon him.</P>

<HEAD>Heere beginneth the first Epistle and first Booke of <HI>Orator Gabriell to the Cati|linaries</HI> or Philippicks.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Wherein is <HI>diuulged,</HI> that venum is venum and will in|infect, that that which is done, cannot <HI>(de facto)</HI> be vndone, that fauour is a curteous Reader, and <HI>G.H.</HI> your thankfull debter.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>A Comment vpon the Text.</HEAD>
<P>_THe learned Orator in this Epistle <HI>taketh precise order</HI> he will not be too eloquent and yet it shall be (L,) <HI>as well for enditing vnworthie to be published, as for publishing vnworthie to be endited.</HI></P>
<P><HI>C.</HI> He had many aduersaries in those times that he wrote, amongst the which Cloth-breeches and Vel|uet-breeches (his fathers pouerty, and his owne pride were none of the meanest.)</P>
<P>After them start vp one <HI>Pierce Pennilesse,</HI> and hee likewise was a stumbling blocke in his way. (Penurie not long tarries after pride; pray all the ropes in <HI>Saf|fron Walden</HI> that I do not prophesie,) Amen, Amen, quoth M. <HI>Bird</HI> and M. <HI>Demetrius.</HI></P>
<P>Hee forbeares to speake much in this place of the one or the other, <HI>because his letters are more forvvard to accuse them than their owne books to condemne them</HI>; yet for a touch by the way, hee talks that Greene is no
<PB REF="10">
liuerey for this winter, <HI>it is pitifully blasted and faded in euerie meade</HI> by the strong breath of his barbarisme.</P>
<P>Hee hath a twitch at <HI>Pierce Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nilesse</HI> too, at the parting stile, and tearms him <HI>the Deuils Orator by pro|fession, and his Dames Poet by practise:</HI> wherein mee thinks (the surreuerence of his works no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> impaired) he h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ie highly ouershotte himselfe: for no more is <HI>Pierce Pennilesse</HI> to be cald the Deuils Orator for ma|king a Supplication to the Deuill, than hee is to bee helde for a Rhethoritian, for setting foorth <HI>Gabrielis Scuruei Rhetor,</HI> wherein hee thought to haue knockt out the braines of poore <HI>Tullies Orator,</HI> but in veri|tie did nothing else but gather a flaunting vnsauory fore-horse no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">egay out of his well furnished gar|land.</P>
<P>The aduanceme~t of the Deuils Oratorship, which he ascribeth to <HI>Pierce Pennilesse,</HI> me thinks had beene a fit place for his Doctorship, when hee mist the Ora|torship of the Vniuersitie, of which in the sequele of his booke he most slanderously complaineth. Doctor <HI>Perne, Greene,</HI> no dead man he spareth.</P>
<P>What he should <HI>subaudi</HI> by his <HI>Dames Poet,</HI> I scarse apprehend, except this, that <HI>Pierce</HI> his Father was <HI>Dame Laws.</HI> Poet, and writte many goodly stories of her in <HI>An Almond for Parrat.</HI></P>
<P>Those that will take a Lecture in our Orators let|ters, must not <HI>read, excuse, commend, credite or beleeue anie approoued truth in</HI> Pierce Pennilesse, especially if it be any thing that vpbraideth the great Baboune brother.</P>
<P><HI>Hee will stoppe the beginning, id est,</HI> when hee hath come behind a man and broke his head, seeke to bind him to the good a bearing, <HI>or els the ende were like to proue pernitio us and perillous</HI> to his confusion.</P>
<P><PB REF="10">Somewhat hee mutters of <HI>defamation and iust com|mendation,</HI> &amp; what a hell it is for him that hath built his heauen in vaine-glory, to bee puld by the sleeue, and bidde <HI>Respice funem,</HI> looke backe to his Fathers house; but I ouerslippe it as friuolous, because all the world knowes him better than he knowes himselfe, &amp; though he play the Pharisie neuer so in iustifiyng his owne innocence, theres none will beleeue him.</P>
<P>Let this bee spoken once for all, as I haue a soule to saue, till this day in all my life with tongue nor penne did I euer in the least worde or tittle derogate from the Doctor. If his brother (without any former pro|uocation on my part God is my witnesse) rayld on me grossely, expresly namde mee, compard me to <HI>Mar|tin,</HI> indeuord to take from mee all estimation of Arte or witte, haue I not cause to bestirre mee?</P>
<P><HI>Gabriell,</HI> I will bestirre mee for all like an Alehouse Knight thou crau'st of <HI>Iustice to do thee reason</HI>; as for <HI>impudencie and calumny,</HI> I returne them in thy face, that in one booke of tenne sheets of paper, hast pub|lisht aboue two hundred lies.</P>

<P>If by <HI>Greene</HI> and not mee, thou shouldst haue writ|ten against <HI>Greene</HI> and not mee. If by both, I will an|swere for both, but not by both, therefore I will aun|swere but for one.</P>
<P>Giue an instance if thou canst for thy life, wherin in any leafe of <HI>Pierce Penilesse</HI> I had so much as halfe a sillables relation to thee, or offred one iot of indigni|tie to thy Father, more than naming the greatest dig|nitie he hath, when for varietie of Epithites I calde thy brother <HI>the sonne of a Ropemaker.</HI></P>

<P>That booke was a learned booke, a labourd booke; for three yere before he put it in print, he had preacht it all without booke.</P>
<P>I my selfe haue some of it in a booke of Setmons that my Tutor at Cambridge made mee gather euery Sunday. Then being very yoong, I counted it the ab|iectest and frothiest forme of Diuinitie that came in that place. Now more confirmed in age and Art, I confirme my ill opinion of it.</P>
<P>Neither do I vrge this as if it were a hainous thing for a man to put sermons in print after hee preacht them, but obserue the proud humor of the pert Didi|mus, that thinks nothing hee speakes but deserues to be put in print, and speakes not that sentence in the Pulpit, which before he rough hewes not ouer with his penne. Besides, I taxe him for turning an olde coate (like a Broker) and selling it for a new.</P>
<P>These and a thousand more imperfections might haue beene buried with his bookes in the bottome of a drie-fatte, and there slept quietly amongst the sha|uings of the Presse, if in his Epistle he had not beene so arrogantly censoriall.</P>
<P>Not mee alone did hee reuile and dare to the com|bat, but g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ickt at <HI>Pap-hatchet</HI> once more, and mister|med all our other Poets and writers about London, piperly make-pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es and make-bates.</P>

<P>The time was when this <HI>Timothie Tiptoes</HI> made a Latine Oration to her Maiestie.

In which respect, of her owne vertue and not his desert, it pleased hir so to humble the height of hir iudgement, as to grace him a little whiles he was pro|nouncing, by these or such like tearmes. <HI>Tis a good pretie fellow, a lookes like an Italian,</HI> and after hee had concluded, to call him to kisse her royall hand. Here|vppon hee goes home to his studie all intraunced, and writes a whole volume of Verses; first <HI>De vul|tu Itali,</HI> of the countenance of the Italian; and then <HI>De osculo manus,</HI> of his kissing the Queenes hande.

<P>He enuiously indeuors since he cannot reuenge him|selfe to incense men of high calling against me, and wold inforce it into their opinions, that whatsoeuer is spoke~ in <HI>Pierce Pennilesse,</HI> concerning <HI>Pesants, Clownes &amp; hipocriticall hot-spurs, Midasses, Buckram Giants, &amp; the mightie Prince of darkenesse</HI> is meant of them, let him proue it, or bring the man to my face to whome I euer made any vnduetifull exposition of it, I am to be my own interpreter in this first case. I say in <HI>Pierce Pennilesse</HI> I haue set downe nothing but that which
<PB REF="40">
I haue had my president for, in forraine writers, nor had I the least allusion to any man set aboue mee in in degree, but onely glanc'st at vice generallie.</P>
<P>The tale of the Beare and the Foxe, how euer it may set fooles heads a worke a farre off, yet I had no concealed ende in it, but in the one, to describe the right nature of a bloudthirsty tyrant, whose indefi|nite appetite all the pleasures in the earth haue no powre to bound in goodnes, but he must seeke a new felicitie in varietie of cruelty, and destroying all other mens prosperitie; for the other, to figure an hypo|crite: Let it be <HI>Martin</HI> if you will, or some old dog that bites sorer than hee, who secretlie goes and se|duceth country Swaines.</P>
<P><HI>Makes them beleeue that that honny which their bees brought forth was poysonous and corrupt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That they may buy honny cheaper than by being at such charges in keeping of bees.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That it is not necessary they should haue such stately hiues or lie sucking at such precious honnicombs.</HI></P>
<P>If this (which is nothing else but to swim with the streame) be to tell tales as shrewdly as mother <HI>Hub|bard,</HI> it shoulde seeme mother <HI>Hubbard</HI> is no great shrewe, howeuer thou treading on her heeles so oft, shee may bee tempted beyonde her ten commande|ments.</P>

Shewe mee the Vniuersities hand and seale that thou art a Doctour sealed and deliuered in the pre|sence of a whole Commensement, and Ile present thee with my whole artillerie store of eloquence.</P>
<P>A bots on thee for mee for a lumpish leaden heeld letter dawber, my stile with treading in thy clammie steps is growne as heauie gated, as if it were bound to an Aldermans pace, with the irons at Newgate cald the widows Almes.</P>
<P>Ere I was chained to thee thus by the necke, I was as light as the Poet <HI>Accius,</HI> who was so lowe and so slender that hee was faine to put lead into his shooes for feare the winde shoulde blowe him into another Countrie.</P>
<P>Those that catch Leopards set cups of wine before them; those that will winne liking and grace of the readers, must set before them continually that which shall cheare them, and reuiue them.</P>

<P>The next peece of seruice thou dost against <HI>Pierce Pennilesse,</HI> is the naming <HI>of him wofull pouerett<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and pleasant supposing thou puldst him by the ragged sleene</HI>: Then matchest thou thy selfe to <HI>Vlisses,</HI> and him to <HI>Irus, Irrita sunt haec omnia:</HI> it is a sleeuelesse ieast, I

haue besliu'd thee already for it, it toucheth the body and not the minde. Besides I was neuer altogether <HI>Peter Poueretto,</HI> vtterly throwne downe, desperately seperated from all means of releeuing my selfe, since I knew how to seperate a knaue from an honest man, or throw my cloake ouer my nose, when I salied by the Counters.</P>
<P>The ragged cognizance on the sleeue, I may say to thee, carried meate in the mouth when time was, doe not dispraise it yet, for it hath many high partakers. <HI>Qua sequuntur huiusmodi sunt.</HI></P>
<P>Thou turmoilst thy <HI>piamater,</HI> to proue base births better than the ofspring of many discents, because thou art a mushrumpe sprung vp in one night, a seely mouse begotten on a moulehill, that wouldst fayne pearch thy selfe on the mountaines, when thy legges are too short to ouercome such a long iourney of glorie.</P>
<P>My margent note, <HI>Meritis expendite causam,</HI> thou wouldst rather than any thing wrest to an enditment of arrogance, &amp; so branch mee into thy tiptoe stocke. I cannot see how thou canst compasse it: For though I bad them weigh the cause by deserts, yet I did not assume too much to my owne deserts, when I expo|stulated, why Coblers, Hostlers, and Carmen should be worth so much, and so much, and I a scholler and a good-fellow a begger. How thou hast arrogated to thy selfe more than <HI>Lucifer,</HI> or any <HI>Miles glori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|sus</HI> in the worlde would doe, I haue already noted at large in his due place and order. If thou bestowst a|ny curtesie on mee, and I do not requite it, then call mee cut, and say I was brought vp at Hoggenorton where pigges play on the Organs.</P>
<P>Wert thou well acquainted with me, thou shouldst
<PB REF="41">
perceiue that I am very franke where I take, &amp; send away none empty-handed that giue mee but halfe an ill worde.</P>
<P>It is a good signe of grace in thee, that thou confes|sest <HI>thou hast offences enough of thy owne to aunswere, though thou beest not chargd with thy Fathers.</HI> Once in thy life thou speakst true yet, I beleeue thee, and pit|tie thee. God make thee a good man, for thou hast beene a wilde youth hitherto.</P>
<P>Thy Hexameter verses, or thy hue and crie after <HI>a person as cleare as Christall,</HI> I do not so deeply com|mend, for al <HI>Maister</HI> Spencer <HI>long since imbrast it with an ouer-louing sonnet.</HI></P>
<P>VVhy should friends dissemble one with another, they are very vgly and artlesse. You will neuer leaue your olde trickes of drawing M. <HI>Spencer</HI> into euerie pybald thing you do. If euer he praisd thee, it was be|cause he had pickt a fine vaine foole out of thee, and he would keepe thee still a foote by flattring thee, til such time as he had brought thee into that extreame loue with thy selfe, that thou shouldst run mad with the conceit, and so be scorned of all men.</P>
<P>Yet yet <HI>Gabriell,</HI> are not we set <HI>non plus,</HI> thy <HI>roister doisterdome</HI> hath not dasht vs out of countenance. If anie man <HI>vse boistrous horse play, or bee beholding to Carters Logique,</HI> it is thy selfe; for with none but clow|nish and roynish ieasts dost thou rush vppon vs, and keepst such <HI>a flurting and a flinging</HI> in euerie leafe, as if thou wert the onely reasty iade in a country.</P>
<P><HI>Skolding thou saiest is the language of shrewes&punc; railing the stile of rakehels</HI>; what concludst thou from thence? Do I scold? do I raile?</P>
<P>Scolding &amp; railing is loud miscalling and reuiling one another without wit, speaking euery thing a man

knows by his neighbour, though it bee neuer so con|trary to all humanitie and good manners, and would make the standers by almost perbrake to heare it.

<P>VVhen I parted with thy brother in <HI>Pierce Peni|lesse, I left him to be tormented world without ende of our Poets and writers about London, for calling them piperly make-playes and makebates, not doubting but they would driue him to this issue, that he should be con|strained to goe to the chiefe beame of his benefice, and there beginning a lame~table speech with cur scripfi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cur pery, ende with Prauum praua decent, iuuat inconcessae voluptas, &amp; so with a trice trusse vp his life in the string of his sance-bell.</HI> Now heere thou thankst God thou a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t not so vncharitably bent to put so much wit in a speech, like a Parson in Lancashire that kneeld down on his knees in a zealous passion, and very hartily thankt God he neuer knew what that vile Antichri|stian Romish Popish Latine meant.

<P>After all this foule weather ensueth a calme di|latement of others too forward harmefulnes, and thy owne backward irefulnesse; thats dispatcht, the court hath found it otherwise.</P>
<P>Then thou goest about to bribe mee to giue ouer this quarrell, and saist if I will holde my peace, thou wilt bestowe more complements of rare amplificati|ons vpon mee, than euer thou bestowdst on Sir <HI>Philip Sidney,</HI> and gentle Maister <HI>Spencer.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Thou protests it was not my person thou mislikt</HI> (I am afraide thou wilt make mee thy Ingle) <HI>but my fierce running at Parson</HI> Richard, <HI>excusest mee by my youth, &amp; promisest to cancell thy impertinent Pamphlet.</HI></P>
<P>It were good hanging thee now thou art in such a good mind; yet for all this, a dogge will be a dogge, &amp; returne to his vomit doe what a man can, thou must haue one squibbe more at the Deuils Orator, &amp; his Dames Poet, or thy penne is not in cleane life.

<P>Thus O heauenly Muse I thanke thee for thou hast giu'n mee the patience to trauel through the tedious wildernesse of this Gomorian Epistle. Not <HI>Hercules</HI> when he cleansed the stables of <HI>Aegeas,</HI> vnder-tooke such a stinking vnsauorie exploit.

<P>The fourth letter of our Orators to the same fauo|rable or indifferent reader, was a letter which this many a long summers day I dare ieopard my may|denhead
<PB REF="43">
had line hidden in his deske, for it is a ship|mans hose that will serue any man as well as <HI>Green</HI> or mee.</P>
<P>To make short, in it as fortie times before, he brides it and simpers it out a crie, No forsooth God dild you hee would not that hee would: None so desirous of quiet as hee good olde man, who with a pure intent of peace, first put fire to the flame that hath hedgde him in.</P>
<P>He hath preuented Maister <HI>Bunnie</HI> of the second part of his treatise of Pacification, for like some craf|tie ringleader of rebellion, when hee hath stirred vp a dangerous commotion, and findes by the too late examination of his forevnexamined defects in him|selfe, that so sweet a roote will hardlie effect corres|pondent fruits strait in pollicie to get his pardon, hee strikes saile to that tempest of sedition, and is thrice as earnest in preaching pacification, obedience, and submission: so <HI>Gabriel</HI> when he hath stird vp against me what tumults he can in Stationers Shops, and left the quiuer of his enuie not an arrow vndrawne out, hee finds by the audit of his ill consumed defectes that he is not of force inough to hold out, wherefore in pollicie to auoid further arrearages of infamie hee tires the text of reconciliation out of breath, and ho|peth by the intercession of <HI>a cuppe of white wine and sugar, to be made friends with his fellow writers.</HI></P>
<P>It cannot choose but he must of necessitie be a ve|ry sore fellow, that is so familiar with white wine &amp; sugar, for white wine in a manner is good for nothing but to wash sores in, and smudge vp withered beauty with. Well for all hee would haue <HI>Pierce</HI> make no warres on him, he makes warres on <HI>Pierce Pennilesse,</HI> he be beggereth him again in this epistle verie boun|tifullie
<PB REF="44">
hee saies <HI>that Lordes must take heede how they Lord it in his presence.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That the Asse is the onelie Author he alleadgeth. That Greene is an Asse in print, and he a calfe in print.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That they are both chiefetaines in licentiousnesse, and truth can s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ie the abhominable villanies of such base shifting companions, good for nothing but to cast away themselues, spoile their adherents, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>For my beggerie let that trauell the countries, I haue saide more for it than a richer man would haue done, but that I take vppon me to Lord it ouer great Lords thou art a most lewd tungd lurden to saie it.</P>
<P>Must they take heede how they Lord it in my pre|sence, what must they doe then in thy presence,
<Q><L>That sitting liks a looker on</L>
<L>Of this worlds stage, dost note with critique pen,</L>
<L>Thy sharpe dislikes of each condition&punc;</L>
<L>Ne fawnest for the fauour of the great,</L>

<L>Lifting the good vp to high honors seate,</L>
<L>And th'euill damning euermore to die,</L>
<L>For life and death is in thy doome full writing.</L></Q></P>
<P>Whereas thou saist the Asse in a manner is the on|ly Author I alleadge, I must know how you define an Asse before I can tell how to answere you; for <HI>Corne|lius Agrippa</HI> maketh all the Philosophers, Oratours, and Poets that euer were Asses: and if so you vnder|stand that I alleadge no Author but the Asse; for all Authors are Asses, why I am for you; if otherwise, thou art worse than a <HI>Cumane</HI> Asse to leape before thou lookst, and condemne a man without cause.</P>
<P>What Authors dost thou alleadge in thy booke,

not two, but any Grammer Scholler might haue al|leadgd?</P>
<P>There is not three kernels of more than common learning in all thy <HI>Foure Letters.</HI> Common learning? not common sense in some places.</P>
<P>Of force I must graunt that <HI>Greene</HI> came oftner in print than men of iudgement allowed off, but neuer|thelesse he was a daintie slaue to content the taile of a Tearme, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">usfe Seruing mens pockets.</P>
<P>An Asse <HI>Gabriel</HI> it is harde thou shouldst name him: for calling mee Calfe it breakes no square, but if I bee a calfe it is in comparison of such an Oxe as thy selfe.</P>
<P><HI>The chiefetaines of licentiousnes, and truth can say the abhominable villanies of such base shifting compani|ons, good for nothing, &amp;c.</HI> I am of the mind wee shall not disgest this neither.</P>
<P>Answere me <HI>succinct&egrave; &amp; expedit&egrave;,</HI> what one period any way leaning to licentiousnes, canst thou produce in <HI>Pierce Pennilesse?</HI></P>
<P>I talke of a great matter when I tell thee of a peri|od, for I know two seuerall periods or full pointes in this last epistle, at least fortie lines long a piece.</P>
<P>For the order of my life it is as ciuil as a ciuil orenge, I lurke in no corners but conuerse in a house of credit as well gouerned as any Colledge, where there bee more rare quallified men, and selected good Schollers than in any Noblemans house that I knowe in Eng|land.</P>
<P>If I had committed <HI>such abhominable villanies, or were a base shifting companion,</HI> it stoode not with my Lords honour to keepe me, but if thou hast saide it &amp; canst not proue it, what slandrous dishonor hast thou done him, to giue it out that he keepes <HI>the committers
<PB REF="45">
of abhominable villanies and base shifting companions,</HI> when they are farre honester than thy selfe.</P>
<P>If I were by thee I woulde plucke thee by the beard, and spit in thy face, but I would dare thee and vrge thee beyonde all excuse to disclose and prooue for thy heart bloud what villanie or base shifting by mee thou canst, I defie all the worlde in that respect.</P>
<P>Because thou vsedst at Cambridge to shift for thy Friday at night suppers, and cosen poore victuallers and pie-wiues of Doctours cheese and puddinges, thou thinkst me one of the same religion too.</P>
<P>What <HI>Greene</HI> was, let some other answere for him as much as I haue done, I had no tuition ouer him, he might haue writ another <HI>Galataeo</HI> of manners, for his manners euerie time I came in his companie, I saw no such base shifting or abhominable villanie by him. Something there was which I haue heard not seene, that hee had not that regarde to his credite in which had beene requisite he should.</P>
<P>VVhat a <HI>Calimunco</HI> am I to plead for him, as though I were as neere him as his owne skinne. A thousande there bee that haue more reason to speake in his be|halfe than I, who since I first knew him about town haue beene two yeares together and not seene him.</P>
<P>But Ile doe as much for any man, especially for a deade man that cannot speake for himselfe. Let vs heare <HI>how we are good for nothing but to cast awaie our selues, spoile our adherents, praie on our fauourers, dis|honour our Patrons.</HI> Haue I euer tooke any likelie course of casting away my selfe?</P>

<P>Haue an eie to the maine-chaunce, for no sooner shall they vnderstand what thou hast said by mee of them, but theyle goe neere to haue thee about the eares for this geare one after another.</P>
<P>My Patrons or anie that bind me to them by the least good turne, there is no man in England that is or shall (for my small power) bee more thankefull vnto than I.

<P>Consider of it well, for it is better than all <HI>Bacons, Architas, Archimedes, Appollonius or Regiomontanus</HI> deuices: for <HI>Gabriell</HI> that professeth all these, with all their helpe cannot make the bias bowle at <HI>Saffron Walden</HI> run downe the hill, when it is throwne down with the hardest hand that may bee, but it will turne vp the hill againe in spite of a mans teeth, and that which is worst, giue no reason for it.</P>
