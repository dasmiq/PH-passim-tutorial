<HEAD>PREFACE
TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>I</HI> am in some sort oblig'd to declare, that no particular resentment of my own,
farther than the sense I had of the general vices of the times, and for the
Information of the publick, induced me to write this Satyr, or give it this Title;
but I confess I now do, and always did think it both my duty, and every ones else
that is Capacitated, to lash and expose Enormities of so damnable a quality as the
characters in the following Stanza's stand tainted with: And therefore if some
severe observers, that may perhaps in this Mirrour see the shadow of an in|timate
Friend or Acquaintance, should think the Reflexions too gross, and open,
let such be pleas'd to consider on the subject matter, the substances, and horrid
Theme that inspires the satyrick Pen, and then doubtless (if they are not well-willers
to the Mathematicks themselves) they will generously allow, that Crimes
of this dreadfull Nature ought not to be Complemented, nor Guilded o'er with
Rhetorick in such a manner, as if the Authour rather design'd to shew the vir|tue
of his own Poetry, than the vice he was writing on. 'Tis true there may be
offences which no Poet is so much a Cynick always to treat at this blunt Rate;
the surly Muse may be strok'd into good nature when the sin comes within the list
of Venial, as for example, Pride may be gloss'd over and call'd Presence of mind,
or Courtly breeding; Fornication may be poetically styl'd the Errour of Licen|tious
bloud, the Imperfection of irregular Youth, not guided by reason or reli|gious
Iudgment; The railing Whig, or what's worse, the <HI>Trimmer</HI> (provided
he speak no Treason) by the obliging Satyrist may be tenderly us'd, because he
has a way with him, and expresses nothing but according to his Conscience; The
sordid Miser may be rendred a wise and provident Person, nay, even the crying
sin Adultery, by the vernish and illustration of Poetry may be guilded o'er with
Moral justice, provided the Wife be Old and Bedrid, and the young Husband
wants an heir for his Estate: But <HI>Paricide,</HI> privy Conspiracy, Rebellion, Incest,
Murther, and such like, must never expect such favour; the Satyr there should
lash to the bloud, and make each stroke so terrible, and the shame so obvious,
that the weakest judgment may comprehend, and feel the meaning: Neither am
I of an opinion with them that affirm, that Satyr should tickle till it Smarts;
<PB REF="5">
I rather, like a good Surgeon, would have it smart soundly at first, the wound
will tickle enough when it is healing: and I am very apt to believe the un|daunted
<HI>Juvenal</HI> was in this mind, for I never read in any of his Satyrs, where
he was daubing any vice, with intent to lessen it, but, encouraged by his perfect
honesty, and man-like bravery of soul, always painted it in its natural Sables;
a Fool was by him drawn like a Fool, inspite of his guilt Coach, gaudy Trappings,
and numberless Acres of dirt, and a Traitour, like a Traitour, though his fortune made
him a Senatour; this I hold as a good example for every just Authour, and which I
am resolv'd to follow, let the Consequence happen as it pleases. Those that have not
read the first Part of this Poem, <HI>viz. (The Progress of honesty,</HI> written in the
beginning of <HI>Oates</HI>'s Plot) will be the less satisfied with these Sheets, not that
I doubt but the Reflexions will be easily understood, for I have always observ'd
that Rhubarb is more pleasing to our Nation than Honey, which, though I am
sorry to know, yet I cannot remedy; and, had I less Zeal for my Country, I should
be less diligent in exposing its faults; but, living under the Government of so
good and gracious a Sovereign, I should think my self unworthy of a smile from
him, or the least blessing of his Royal favour, if I should not, with my utmost
vigour and severest Genius, expose and render odious to futurity, the unnatural
<HI>Agents and Associatours in so horrible a Conspiracy.</HI></P>

<L>Telling their sable Loves the business of the day,</L>
<L>And on what Farmer's Stubble they should prey:</L>

<L>Newly converted to the Truth,</L>
<L>And by his Father's sage advice brought in</L>
<L>From the wide, pleasant, but destructive, paths of Sin,</L>
<L>Rose from the humble Couch whereon he lay,</L>
<L>And where with watry Eyes he past the Night's fatigue away:</L>
<L>For fatal visions had disturb'd his breast,</L>
<L>And Rob'd him of his darling Rest;</L>
<L>Visions of Beauties snares, and Love in vain</L>
<L>Of souls despairing, and Eternal Pain,</L>
<L>Of hellish Traitours that were damn'd for gain,</L>

<L>That Devils in the shape of Saints devise</L>
<L>To murther Kings and root up Monarchies.</L>
<L>His constitution and complexion were</L>
<L>True Omens of his future care;</L>
<L>A Sable melancholy clog'd his bloud,</L>
<L>Which seldom e'er presages good,</L>
<L>And deadly Paleness fill'd his cheeks, which show'd</L>
<L>As if he thought his life did vainly Waste,</L>
<L>Or had reflected on the Ills his Youth had past.</L>

<L>Through verdant Meads, and flow'ry Vales he goes,</L>
<L>Where many a Beauteous Rose</L>
<L>Delightfull Odours did dispense</L>
<L>To his too Stupid and Neglectfull Sense,</L>
<L>Blushing as if they thought it were a Crime,</L>

<L>Whose Billows envying such Aspiring height,</L>
<L>Seem'd with Impetuous might</L>
<L>To undermine its Root, and make it bow</L>
<L>Its Towering front to the salt Deeps below;</L>
<L>There looking down upon the foaming Beach,</L>
<L>Sate a forlorn uncomfortable Wretch,</L>
<L>Grizled with hair, by Sorrow, and by Years,</L>
<L>His Sullen face bedew'd with Tears,</L>
<L>Lookt like the Figure of Mortality,</L>
<L>Or Man in his first State of misery;</L>
<L>Savage his Mein, and wretched his Attire,</L>
<L>Yet lofty thoughts did in his breast Conspire,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="7">Which gave this utterance to his Tongue,</L>

<L>Thus spoke the Satyrist, A man that had,</L>
