<P>_THE estate of the Church of Christ (NOBLE LADIE) whereof wee reioyce to be accounted feeling mem|bers, hath beene subject vnto manifold afflictions, even from the beginning of the world: (not like vn|to the estate of <HI>Moab</HI> setled vpon her dregs;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iere. 48.11.</NOTE> and not poured out from vessell to vessell) yet the more afflicted, the more beloved of God; whose face, watred with teares, is faire; and whose mourning voyce, is pleasant in the sight of God:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cant. 2.14.</NOTE> and as doing of good willingly, hath a great recompence of reward from God: even so patient suffering of evill, for righteousnesse sake, as it is high|ly commended in Scripture, so it shall be richly re|warded in heaven: yea the very heathnick Philoso|pher
<PB REF="4">
<HI>Plato</HI> (to whom the glory of the sufferings for Christ was vnknowne) affirmeth that men who suf|fer,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plato in repub.</HI></NOTE> scourging, binding, tormenting, boring out of eyes, and finally, strangling of their breath for righte|ousnesse sake, are exceeding happy, are (as the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> importeth) thrice happy: although the su|perlatiue degree of suffering, which can be found a|mongst the heathnicks, could never equall the glo|rie of the sufferings of Christians. They who were initiated in the mysteries of <HI>Mittera</HI> (which word in the Persian language signifieth the Sunne) could not bee admitted to that honour,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE> before they had beene tried by suffering fourscore divers sorts of pu|nishments; such as long abstinence from meate and drinke, solitarie living in the wildernes a long time, tryall of suffering the fervent heate of fire, and the coldnes of water, and many other torments, vntill the number of fourescore had beene completed. These voluntarie sufferings, like as in the beginning they wanted the warrant of Gods calling, so likewise in the end they wanted the hope of Gods reward, but the mouth of God himselfe pronounceth: Christians to be blessed who die in the Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Apoc. 14.13.</NOTE> for they rest from their labours, and their works follow them.</P>
<P>The manifold persecutions of the Church, may be devided into three rankes;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three rankes of the persecu|tion of the Church.</NOTE> some were fierce and bloodie, some were craftie, the third was and is, both craftie and cruell. The ten heathnicke Emperours, <HI>Nero, Domitian, Traian, &amp;c.</HI> were so prodigall of the blood of the Lords Saints, that they poured it out like water vpon the ground: The Arrian Emperors were subdolous and craftie; but the persecution of
<PB REF="4">
Antichrist which is the third, goeth beyond the rest both in crueltie and craft: yea the experience which we haue had in our owne dayes of the cruelty of An|tichrists supposts, and their craftie convey of their malicious enterprises intended against our Sove|raigne Lord, His Royall race, and Noble Counsel|lers, doth cleerely proue that the malice and craft of Antichrist, goeth as farre beyond the craft and malice of all Emperours, as the flood of <HI>Noah,</HI> exceedeth the inundation of <HI>Nilus.</HI></P>
<P>In the first,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The estate of the Church in the 1, 2, and 3 Centuries.</NOTE> second, and third, Centuries, the faith and patience of Christians was tried by the yoake of ten bloody persecutions. For first the Apostles, (who had heard with their eares the words of the great she|pheard of our soules, and seene with their eyes God manifested in the flesh) were chosen to be faithfull to the world, of the doings, sufferings, and doctrine, of Iesus Christ: and next to the Apostles their Disciples and true successours, sealed vp with rivers of blood that faith, which they receiued from the Apostles.</P>
<P>The fire wherewith they were burnt; the water wherein they were drowned; the ayre wherein their bodies were hanged; the mountaines and wilder|nesses through which they wandered; the darke pri|sons wherein they were enclosed (as people vnwor|thy of libertie); yea all the elements &amp; the very light of heauen, from whence by most vnrighteous vio|lence they (the righteous heires thereof) were exclu|ded; all these (I say) were witnesses of their glori|ous sufferings.</P>
<P>In the fourth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The estate of the Church in the 4. 5. and 6. Centuries.</NOTE> fift, and sixt, Centuries, the know|ledge of the Church was tryed by Heretiques, who
<PB REF="5">
by the mistie clowds of error, endeavoured to blind|fold the eyes of men, and to leade them captiue from the simplicity of the truth of God; at which time also, the power of the light of God was mani|fested, in discipating the darknesse of errours, as the Sun-rising doth the darknesse of the night.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The estate of the Church in the 10. 11. and 12.

If penne could blush, if hand could tremble, if paper could bee ashamed, such ridiculous fables had not beene written. At this time learning was not to bee found in Pastors, sincerity in Councels, humility in Prelates, and true religion in the multitude of peo|ple and Nations: For in stead of these, there was a|bundance of Liturgies, Processions, and Pilgrima|ges, Masses, superstitious vowes, multiplication of vnprofitable ceremonies, confidence in externall ser|vice, as if it could saue, <HI>ex opere operato,</HI> Fastings, tyed to dayes and moneths, not vnlike to the fasts of the Donatists.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 32.32.</NOTE> At this time the vines of <HI>Sodome</HI> and <HI>Go|morrah</HI> abounded with grapes of gall, and bitter clusters. At this time the key of the kingdome of God, seemed almost lost; the preaching of the kin|dome of Christ, ceased for the most part: The au|thority and preheminence of the Pope over Princes, and all men in spirituall offices (like the axes and hammers of the <HI>Assyrians,</HI> cutting downe the car|ved worke of the house of the Lord) sounded so lowd in all Churches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 74.16.</NOTE> that the sound of the Gospell could, scarcely be heard. And although at this time there were some Romane Bishops who spoke against the kingdome of the Divell, yet their hearts were so filled by him, with ambition, avarice, vncleannesse, contempt of the lawfull authority of Princes, super|stition,
<PB REF="6">
and horrible idolatry, that hee led them head-long to hell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Simile.</NOTE> as men may leade dogs (though barking aloud) whither they please.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The estate of the Church in the 13. 14. 15. and 16. Cen|turies.</NOTE>In the thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, and six|teenth, Centuries; even to these our times, there is nothing to bee expected, but a discoverie of Anti|christs hypocrisie, a decay of his vsurped authority, an abrogation of his tyrannous lawes; and finally, an vtter ruine and destruction of his kingdome, not|withstanding of all the maintainers and vpholders of the same. And surely, it is a great encouragement to vs, when we see false teachers dayly renuing their forces to fight against the truth, as the <HI>Philistims</HI> did, who fought against <HI>David</HI> in the valley of <HI>Rephaim,</HI> after they had beene often discomfited by him. The last period of their reluctation against the Lords an|noynted, was losse and hurt to themselues, and dis|honour to their gods,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Chron. 14.11.</NOTE> whom they were forced to leaue behinde them, which <HI>David</HI> tooke and burnt with fire, calling the place <HI>Baalperatzim</HI> (that is) the rupture of Baal. The adversaries of the Gospell in Christendom, by renuing their forces againe, are pro|curing a new name vnto their Idols: They cannot bee content with the name of <HI>Baal-peor, Baal-meon, Baal-thamar, Baal-chatsor, Baal-gad</HI>; but they will spread out their banners in the valley of <HI>Rephaim</HI> a|gainst the Lord, longing for the last name, <HI>Baal-pe|peratzim,</HI> confusion to themselves.</P>
<P>That this hath beene the estate of the Church, e|uer since the dayes of Christ vntill this present, doth evidently appeare out of the ensuing History, where|in besides the antiquity and visibility of this our
<PB REF="6">
Church, your Ladiship may also (as in a mirrour) behold her wonderful constancie opposed to her e|nemies cruelty. Let the Papists to cover the turpi|tude of their new found doctrine, pretend antiquity as much as they will, yet they will never bee able to proue it. So did the <HI>Hagarens</HI> boldly vsurp the name of <HI>Saracens,</HI> although they were only the brood that sprang from the wombe of <HI>Hagar,</HI> the hand-maide of <HI>Sarah.</HI> And the Priests boy in the dayes of <HI>Eli</HI> came to the Caldron, while the flesh of the peace-of|fering was seething,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 2.14.</NOTE> and thrust in his flesh-hooke, all that the flesh-hooke brought vp, the Priest tooke for himselfe, which thing was done by violence, the Priest having no right thereto. The Roman Church in our dayes having borrowed the flesh-hooke of the Priests boy, and violently arrogated vnto themselues, the faithfull keeping of ancient Apostolique traditi|ons; when wee demand where the Charter contai|ning their title and right, wee see nothing but the flesh-hooke, with these three teeth in their hand: 1. The Church cannot erre. 2. Wee are the true Church. 3. Cursed be hee that saith in matters of faith, our generall Councels can erre.</P>
<P>Madam, accept vnder your Ladiships favourable protection, these my travailes in weaknesse, not vn|like the writer (whose life it hath pleased the Lord to prolong these many yeeres by-past, vnder many in|firmities of a dayly decaying tabernacle) containing a faithfull testimony of my humble endeavour, to confirme the branches of your noble houshould in the true faith of Christ. Though there be many that forsake Christ, and are as reprobate silver from whom
<PB REF="7">
the drosse cannot bee separated; yet let the Noble house of <HI>Marre</HI> follow Christ.

<P>Now the mercies of the Lord Iesus, <HI>The Author and finisher of our faith,</HI> attend vpon my Lord your hus|band, vpon your Ladiship, and all your Noble house: and <HI>The great Mediator of the covenant of God, stablish all your hearts in the certainty of his vndoubted truth, vnto the end, and in the end.</HI> Amen.</P>

<HEAD>The Authors Epistle to the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>_IT was admired of old,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theod, l. <HI>4.</HI> c. 26.</NOTE> that <HI>Aphraates,</HI> who lived in the Cottages of the wilder|nesse all his time, yet once was found in the streets of <HI>Antiochia,</HI> in the dayes of the Emperour <HI>Valens</HI>: He excused the change of his former behaviour, by the similitude of a modest Virgin, lurking quietly in the se|cret corners of her fathers house, so long as it is in safety, but if it be set on fire, it is a hurtfull modestie to lurke any longer; necessity forceth her to runne abroad, that shee may giue warning of the imminent danger. This exam|ple of <HI>Aphraates</HI> might sufficiently excuse mine vnaccu|stomed boldnesse, to set forth my head, which hath beene lapped vp so long in hurtfull silence. For now the power of darkness increaseth, and (as the Prophet sayth): <HI>Woe vnto vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ier, 6.4.</NOTE> for the day declineth, and the shadowes of the evening are stretched out, yea the shadowe of Mount Athos reacheth to the Isle Lemnos, a sure fore-running token, of the going downe of the Sun.</HI> And therefore now it is time to creepe out of our subterra|neall caues, that wee may giue notice to quence the fire in time, before it spread further, and bring greater desolati|on to the house of our God. Papists are become insolent of late dayes (like vnto Serpents in summer weather, taking courage, and byting the heeles of horses that the riders may
<PB REF="8">
fall) not sparing both in word and writ, to reproch our re|ligion, as not countenanced by An iquity; and our Mini|strie as altogether naked and voyd of the knowledge of an|cient learning: Shall wee now stand still (as idle men in the market-places) one looking vpon another? I had ra|ther (then wee should sustaine such apparent damage and hurt, through vntimely silence) step forth with the <HI>Lace|demonian</HI> souldier, impotent of his legs, and neither apt to fight, nor able to flie; having this comfort (as he had) that happily I may blunt the edge of the enemies sword, and make others ashamed, who are more fit for fighting then I am. And although those who haue vndertaken to write <HI>Compends,</HI> haue found therein great difficulty, being so invironed with straits, that they finde it very hard, either to satisfie themselues or others (for if the <HI>Compends</HI> bee short, they seeme obscure; if written at length, they seeme to haue need of other <HI>Compends,</HI> to a|bridge their prolixity) yet notwithstanding of all these difficulties, it is better to set forward by doing some good, either to our selues or others, then to spend our time in idle|nesse, left our cogitations (like vnto the vpper and lower mill-stones,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Simile.</HI></NOTE> which lacking good graine to grinde vpon, rub violently one vpon another, vntill both be broken) not be|ing well exercised, but spent vpon vaine things, become hurtfull to both our soules, and bodies.</P>

<P>Take in good part the Goats-haire, and Rammes-skins, which I present to cover the Tabernacle of our God. I re|ferre the ornaments of gold, silver, and precious-stones, for beautifying the inner parts of the Tabernacle, to others, vp|on whom God hath vouchsafed greater gifts. The house of God is large and ample, and as it hath neede of bright-shi|ning torches, for the Hauls, Parlors, and Chambers; so it hath need of smaller lights, for Cellers, and office-houses: if my farthing candle giue light in the lowes Celler of the house of God, my heart is fully content.

Three other things that are more necessarie to the edificati|on of the Church I will touch.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 The malice of Satan a|gainst true Pastors.</NOTE> First the malice of the deuill, who hateth the welfare of the sheepfold of Christ, and la|boureth either to spoyle it of true Pastors, or to send in among them poore sheepe hyrelings, and men not regarding the wellfare of the flock, but their own gaine: or else, if they haue true Pastors, to mooue the flocke to be disobedient to faithfull and vigilant Pastors. The stocke that can eschew all these three snares of the deuill, and all these three wofull calamities, so oft seasing vpon the poore sheepefolde, they are in good estate. Reade <HI>Chrysostome</HI> writing vpon the 13. chap. Heb. ver. 17.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2</NOTE> Another thing is worthie to be marked, that in three great persecutions, in the fift, sixt, and seuenth, <HI>Origen</HI> a man more renowmed in his life time then after his death, God vouchsafed vpon him two great honours, but not the third, whereof he was most of all desirous.

Third|ly let vs marke the great difference that is betweene the vo|lume of the booke of holy canonicke and sacred Scripture, and all other bookes whatsoeuer. In Scripture the ouer|passing of matters of great importance and moment is not for ignorance, misknowledge or doubting of those things that are ouerslidden,<NOTE PLACE="marg">difference betwixt holy scripture and other bookes.</NOTE> but for mysterie and representation of things more necessarie to be knowne: as namely when <HI>Moses</HI> a most accurat writer of the life, death, and genealogies, of ho|ly Patriarches: ouerpasseth the description of the genealogie, death, &amp; beginning, of the life of <HI>Melchisedecke</HI>: this was done of purpose to bring in <HI>Melchssedeck,</HI> as a type and figure of the true king of peace Christ Iesus, as the Apostle declareth, Heb. 7. but among ecclesiasticall writers I finde a preterition of the names of these worthy Pastors who were martyred for the cause of Christ in the sixt persecution, and this ouerpassing with silence so weigh|tie a matter, is a secret confession of ignorance in this part of the historie, together with a doubting, whether <HI>Vrbanus</HI> the first, <HI>Valerianus, Tiburtius, Cecilia,</HI> and <HI>Martina</HI> suffered vnder <HI>Alexander,</HI> or vnder <HI>Maximinus,</HI> or vnder <HI>Decius.</HI> Yea <HI>Platina</HI> writeth it was the opinion of some men that <HI>Vrbanus</HI> 1. was martyred in the persecution of <HI>Dioclesian.</HI> I haue insisted at greater length in this purpose to the end that euery man may giue vnto sacred scripture that reue|rence

Be|fore I touch the History of the tenth persecution, three things are to be premitted. First, that after the persecution <MILESTONE N="1"> of <HI>Valerian</HI> the eight Persecuter, the Church enioyed great peace, which albeit it was like to bee cut off by the altered minde of <HI>Aurelian,</HI> yet the wise dispensation of the wisdome of God, provided that all his cruell enterprises were disap|pointed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 129.4.</NOTE> <HI>The righteous Lord cutted the cords of the wicked.</HI> Secondly, Christians were in great favour and credit with <MILESTONE N="2"> Emperours, and to them was committed the gouernment of Provinces and Nations, as cleerly appeared in the prefer|ment of <HI>Dorotheus</HI> and <HI>Gorgonius.</HI> Thirdly, they had liber|tie to build Oratories and Temples, large and ample in e|very <MILESTONE N="3"> Citie.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Temples were built by Chri|stians after the death of <HI>Vale|rian. Euseb. lib.</HI> 3. <HI>cap.</HI> 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>All this came to passe in the forty yeeres peace, that inter|vened betweene the raigne of <HI>Valerian,</HI> and the nineteenth yeere of the raigne of <HI>Dioclesian.</HI> Yet the Church of Christ in this short time began to be festred with the corrupt manners of carnall and fleshly people, so that contentions abounded, but charity waxed cold in the Church of God. What wonder was it then that the Lord permitted this tenth and most horrible persecution of <HI>Dioclesian</HI> to stirre and to waken drowsie Christians, who were beginning to be fa|shioned according to the likenesse of the world?</P>
<P>In the nineteenth yeere of his Imperiall authority, and in the moneth of <HI>March,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The 10. Per|secution. <HI>Anno Ch.</HI> 308.</NOTE> this horrible persecution began to arise: <HI>Dioclesian</HI> in the East, and <HI>Maximianus</HI> in the West, bending all their forces to roote out the profession of Chri|stians, out of the world, <HI>Dioclesian</HI> was pufft vp in pride for

his manifold victories and triumphes, and would bee coun|ted a God, and adorned his shooes with gold and precious stones, and commanded the people to kisse his feete. This Persecution continued ten yeeres, even vntill the seventh yeere of the raigne of <HI>Constantine</HI> the great. So that what|soever cruelty was practised by <HI>Maximinianus, Maximinus, Maxentius,</HI> and <HI>Licinius,</HI> all goeth vnder the name of <HI>Dio|clesian,</HI> the author of this tenth persecution. Cruell edicts and proclamations were set forth in the beginning of this persecution, co~manding to overthrow &amp; cast to the ground the Temples of Christians, to burne the bookes of holy Scripture, to displace all such as were magistrates and were in office, and to cast Christian Bishops into prison, and to compell them with sundry kinds of punishments, to offer vnto Idols. Also common people, who would not re|nounce the profession of Christianity to be spoyled of their liberty.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Euseb. lib.</HI> 8. <HI>cap.</HI> 3.

<P>These edicts were hastily put in execution. Many Chri|stians were scourged, racked, and cruciated with intolerable torments. Some were violently drawne to impure sacrifice, and as though they had sacrificed, when indeede they did not, were let goe: some were downe vpon the ground, and drawne by the legges a great space, and the people was made to beleeue that they had sacrificed: some stoutly withstood them, and denyed with a lowd voyce, that they had not bin, or ever would be partakers of Idolatry. Notwithstanding, of the weake sort, many for feare and infirmity gaue over even at the first assault. When the foresaid edicts were pro|claimed,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iohn</HI> a noble man borne, rent in peeces, the Emperors Proclamation. <HI>Euseb. lib.</HI> 8. <HI>cap.</HI> 5.</NOTE> both the Emperours happened to be in the towne of Nicomedia: notwithstanding a certaine Christian being a noble man borne, whose name was <HI>Iohn,</HI> ranne and tooke downe the proclamation, and openly tare and rent it peeces.

<P>In Nicomedia the Emperour refraind not from the slaugh|ter and death of the children of Emperours,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Euseb. lib.</HI> 8. <HI>cap.</HI> 4.</NOTE> neither yet from the slaughter of the chiefest princes of his court, such as <HI>Peter,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> whose body, being beaten with whips and torne that a man might see the bare bones, and after they had mingled vineger and salt, they powred it vpon the most tender partes of his body, and lastly rosted him at a soft fire as a man would rost flesh to eare, and so this victorious martyr ended his life. <HI>Dorotheus</HI> and <HI>Gorgonius</HI> being in great authoritie and office vnder the Emperour after diuerse torments were strangled with an halter.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The martyr|dome of <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ter Do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orbeus</HI> and <HI>Gorgonius.

The bodies of the sonnes of Emperours that were buried, they digged out of their graues, and sent them in boates to bee buried in the bottome of the sea, lest Christians should haue worshipped them as gods, if their sepulchres had beene knowne, such opinion they had of Christians.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Euseb. lib.</HI> 8. <HI>cap.</HI> 6.</NOTE> The number of twentie thousand burned in one temple of Nicomedia by <HI>Maximinus</HI> smelleth of the libertie that <HI>Nicephorus</HI> taketh in adding many things to the veritie of the historie.

<HEAD>Constantine.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Church of Christ flourished in time of the ten Persecutions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Similitude.</NOTE> as a Palme tree groweth vnder the burthen, and spreads out her branches by increasing growth toward heaven. Satan on the other part, that piercing and crooked Serpent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Esa. 27.1.</NOTE> who striues against the militant Church of God, both by might and slight: when his might faileth, it is time to try his slight: which he did by the canker-worme of hereticall doctrine. Now therefore, let vs entreate of the <HI>Arrian</HI> and <HI>Eutychian</HI> Persecutors, in the three subsequent Centuries. Other Heretiques, albeit they were fierce and cruell, such as the Donatists, yet their crueltie was like vnto the stighling of a fish,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Similitude.</NOTE> when the water is ebbed, and shee is not covered with the deepenesse of over-flowing water: the more stirre she maketh, the nearer shee is vnto her death. But the Arrian and Eutychian Heretiques found Empe|rours favourably inclined to the maintenance of their er|rors, such as <HI>Constantius</HI> and <HI>Valens,</HI> protectors of the Arrian heresie, <HI>Anastatius</HI> and <HI>Heraclius,</HI> favourers of the heresie of <HI>Eutyches.</HI> This support they had of supreame powers, strengthened the arme of Heretiques, and made them able to persecute the true Church of Christ.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding, betwixt the ten great Persecutions, and the Arrian persecution, a short breathing time was granted by God vnto his Church, who will not suffer the rodde of the wicked perpetually to lie vpo~ the righteous, lest they put out their hand vnto inquity. The dayes of the raigne of <HI>Con|stantine,</HI> were the breathing daies of the persecuted Church:
<PB N="59" REF="38">
Men banished for the cause of Christ, by the Emperours edicts were returned from their banishment, restored to their offices, dignities, and possessions, which duely belonged vn|to them. The heritage and goods of such as had suffered death for the cause of Christ, were allotted to their neerest kinsmen, and in case none of these were found aliue, then their goods were ordained to appertaine vnto the Church. These beginnings of an admirable change of the estate of persecuted men,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Euseb. de vita Const. lib.</HI></NOTE> wrought in the hearts of all people a won|derfull astonishment, considering within themselues what could bee the event of such sudden and vnexpected alte|ration.</P>
<P>The care that <HI>Constantine</HI> had to disburthen persecuted Christians of that heauy yoke of persecution, that pressed them downe so long, was not onely extended to the bounds of the Romane Empire, wherein <HI>Constantine</HI> was sove|raigne Lord, and absolute Commander: But he was care|full also to procure the peace of Christians, who lived vnder <HI>Sapores</HI> King of Persia,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sozon. lib.</HI> 2. <HI>cap.</HI> 14.</NOTE> who vexed Christian people with sore and grievous persecution: so that within his Domini|ons, more then sixteene thousand were found, who had concluded their liues by martyrdome. Among whom <HI>Si|meon</HI> Bishop of Selentia,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Idem lib.</HI> 2. <HI>cap.</HI> 8 9.10. &amp; 13.</NOTE> and <HI>Vstazares</HI> the Kings eldest Eu|nuch, and his nurs-father in time of his minority, <HI>Pusices,</HI> ruler of all the Kings Artificers, <HI>Azades</HI> the Kings beloved Eunuch, and <HI>Acepcimas,</HI> a Bishop in Persia: all these were men of Note, and Marke, who suffered martyrdome vnder <HI>Sapores,</HI> King of Persia.</P>
<P>While the cogitations of <HI>Constantine</HI> were exercised with meditation,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sozom. lib.</HI> 2. <HI>cap.</HI> 15.</NOTE> by what meanes the distressed estate of Christi|ans in Persia might be supported: by the providence of God, the Ambassadours of <HI>Sapores,</HI> King of Persia, came to the Emperor <HI>Constantine</HI>: whose petitions when he had gran|ted, hee sent them backe againe to their Lord and Master: and hee sent with them a Letter of his owne, intreating <HI>Sa|pores</HI> to bee friendly to Christians, in whose Religion no|thing can be found, that can iustly bee blamed. His letter

What peace was procured to distressed Christians in Persia by this letter of <HI>Constantine,</HI> the history beares not: alwayes his en|devour was honest and godly.</P>
<P>In <HI>Constantines</HI> dayes the Gospell was propagated in East India,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ruffin. l.</HI> 1. <HI>c</HI> 9. <HI>Theod. l.</HI> 1 <HI>c.</HI> 22. <HI>Sozom. l.</HI> 2. <HI>c.</HI> 24 <HI>Ruff. l.</HI> 1. <HI>c.</HI> 10. <HI>Socrat. l.</HI> 1. <HI>c.</HI> 20 <HI>Theod l.</HI> 1. 23. <HI>Sozom. l</HI> 2. <HI>c.</HI> 6.</NOTE> by <HI>Frumentius</HI> and <HI>Edesius,</HI> the brother sonnes of <HI>Meropius,</HI> a man of Tyrus.

Like|wise it was propagated in Iberia, a country lying in the vt|termost part of the Euxine Sea, by the meanes of a captiue Christian woman, by whose supplications, first a childe, deadly diseased, recovered health, and afterward the Queen of Iberia her selfe was relieved from a dangerous disease, by her prayers made to Christ. The King of Iberia sent Am|bassadours to <HI>Constantine,</HI> craving of him, that hee would send Preachers and Doctors to the countrey of Iberia, who might instruct them in the true faith of Christ.

<P>The care this good Emperour had, to quench the schisme that began in Alexandria, shall bee declared in its due time, God willing. In some things <HI>Constantine</HI> was not vnlike to King <HI>Salomon,</HI> who finding his Kingdome to be peaceably settled, hee gaue himselfe to the building of the Temple, of Palaces, and of Townes, which hee fortified and made strong.

<P>During the life-time of his brother <HI>Constans,</HI> Arrianisme had no great vpper hand, because <HI>Constans</HI> Emperour of the West protected <HI>Paulus</HI> Bishop of Constantinople, &amp; <HI>Atha|nasius</HI> Bishop of Alexandria, and the rest of the Bishoppes whom the Arrians had most vniustly accused, deposed, and persecuted.

Fourteene Bishops (whose names are particularly mentioned by <HI>Theodoretus</HI>) were banished, of whom some died in the way, when they were transpor|ted, others died in the place of their banishment. Forty good Christians in Alexandria were scourged with rods, because they would not communicate with the Arrian wolfe <HI>Georgius</HI>: and so pitiously demained, that some peeces of the rods were so deepely fixed in their flesh, that they could not bee drawne out againe, and many through excessiue paine of their wounded bodies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pro. 10.9</NOTE> concluded their liues.

<P><HI>Gaina</HI> of a simple souldier was made generall Comman|der of <HI>Arcadius</HI> his army: hee waxed insolent and proud, affected the kingdome, being in blood a stranger, of the

Nation of the Goths, in religion an Arrian.

In like manner <HI>Stilico,</HI> the Emperours father in law (for <HI>Hono|rius</HI> married his daughter) and the Emperors chiefe Coun|seller, presumed to drawe the kingdome to <HI>Eucherius</HI> his sonne, and stirred vp the Vandales, Burgundians, Almans, and diverse others to invade the kingdome of France, to the end that <HI>Honorius</HI> being overcharged with the multi|tude of vnsupportable businesse, might permit <HI>Stilico</HI> to set forward to the designes of his owne heart.

<P>The Vandales were partly Pagans and partly Arrians whereby it came to passe that the true Church in Africke was persecuted with no lesse inhumanitie; and barbar|ous crueltie by <HI>Gensericus</HI> King of the Vandales, then it was in the dayes of the Emp. <HI>Dioclesian.

Belisarius</HI> first fought against the Persians, who had overcome not onely Mesopotamia, but also many parts of Syria, Antrochena, and Cava. Hee overcame them in battell, and compelled them to goe back beyond Euphrates. Next, he was employed to fight against the Vandales in Africke, who possessed great bounds of the Romane dominions, ever since the dayes of <HI>Gensericus,</HI> King of the Vandales.

At this time the Empire of the East was in the hands of the Empresse <HI>Irene,</HI> and in the hands of the Emperour <HI>Nicephorus,</HI> who had ba|nished <HI>Irene,</HI> and raigned in her stead. The Empire of the East was also weake at this time, as appeareth by a covenant of peace which they concluded with <HI>Charles,</HI> Emperour of the West: in the which no mention is made of <HI>Exarchatus Ravennae,</HI> to be rendred againe vnto them: onely that the Isle of Sicile, and the townes and lands which lie from Na|ples Eastward on the right hand, and from Manfredonia (sometimes called <HI>Syponto</HI>) on the left hand, compassed a|bout

In doing of his affaires, magnanimous: verie affable to meeke men: a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> enemie to proud persons: a man of an excellent wit and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> morie: whomsoeuer he had once knowne, albeit hee had beene absent from him a long space, yet the Emperour could call vpon him by his name, as if hee had beene day|ly conuersant with him: He was crowned Emperour by Pope <HI>Adrian</HI> the 4. to whom hee did this honour, when the Pope met him at Sutrium, the Emperour lighted off his horse, and came on foote to salute the Pope. And when our holy father was dismounted from his horse, the Empe|rour did hold his left stirrop in steed of the right, and when the Pope was somewhat offended, thereat, the Emperour softly smiling craued pardon of his ouersight, because hee was not accustomed with such seruile offices. Before the Coronation of the Emperour,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> Pope <HI>Adrian</HI> required of him this condition that hee should fight against <HI>William</HI> Duke of Apulia for recouering of that Dukedome to the Chaire of Rome. Neuerthelesse the Pope not expecting the Emperours leasure, incited <HI>Emmanuell</HI> Emperour of Con|stantinople to driue <HI>William</HI> Duke of Apulia out of Italie, and addressed himselfe and his Cardinals to warrefare, ha|uing first excommunicated <HI>William</HI> Duke of Apulia. On the other part, <HI>William</HI> begged peace from the Pope, pro|mising to restore vnto him all that belonged to the chaire of Rome; and more also. But by the malignant Councel of his Cardinals, the Pope would not hearken to conditi|ons of peace, hoping to gaine more by warrefare. The Duke seeing no hope of peace brought his forces out of Sicile, ariued at Apulia, and did fight against <HI>Emmanuel</HI>
<PB N="130" REF="74">
and did put him to flight. This done, hee marched fore|ward toward Benaventure, where the Pope and his Cardi|nalls were expecting victorie. But the Duke so strictly pressed the cittie, that the Pope and his Cardinals were glad to sue for peace, which they refused before. The conditi|ons of peace were these, that the Duke should invade no possession belonging to the Roman Church, and on the o|ther part the Pope should acknowledge <HI>William</HI> to be King of both Siciles.</P>
<P>The bad successe of the Popes enterprises was not vn|knowne to the Emperour, who pondering in his own heart, the iniures which his predecessors had suffered by Popes, specially in bereauing them of the right of inuesting of Bishops, and in sending Ambassadors so frequently to Ger|manie to the great impouerishing of his dominions, where|at the Emperour conceiued such indignation, that he char|ged all Germanie,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> that they should not receiue the Popes Legats in time to come, except they were expreslie sent for: and that no man should make appellation to Rome: also in the Letters sent to the Pope hee prefixed his owne name to the Popes name. The Pope tooke all this matter grieue|ouslie, and perswaded the towns of Italie to make defection from the obedience of the Emperour, and specially the towne of Millan rebelled against him. But <HI>Fredericke</HI> brought them partly by force, and partly by feare vnder his subiection againe. In the end the Pope had recourse to the old weapons of his warfare, and he excommunicated the Emperour, but the Lord suffered not this proud Pope to es|cape vnpunished, for as he was walking with his attendants, in a Towne called Anagnia, a flie entered into his throte, and choked his breath.</P>
<P>After the death of <HI>Adrian</HI> the Emperour was not free of trouble, in regard of the schisme that fell out in the Ro|man Church, for two Bishops contended for the Pope|dome, to wit <HI>Alexander</HI> the third and <HI>Victor</HI> the fourth. The Emperour was required to pacifie this schisme, who gathered a councel at Papia, and desired both the Popes
<PB N="131" REF="74">
to be present to heare their cause discussed in a lawfull as|semblie. But Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> disdained to be iudged of any man, and therefore he appeared not before the councell; For which cause the Emperour and the councell ratified the election of <HI>Victor</HI> the 4. Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> fled to France and cursed both the Emperour, and his owne competitor <HI>Victor.</HI> Afterward by money and flatterie, (powerfull weapons in a declining age) he procured such fauour in the Citie of Rome that he was receiued gladly of the most part of the city. Pope <HI>Victor</HI> had ended his life before this time, to whom <HI>Guido</HI> Bishop of Cremona was appointed successour whom they called <HI>Paschalis tertius,</HI> and many followed him. When Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> came to Rome the Townes of Italie were in great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ope of libertie, and rebelled against the Emperour, they reedefied the towne of Millan, which the Emperour had sacked, and ruinated, and they builded a towne called A|lexandria in contempt of the Emperour; and in honour of the Pope. When the Emperour <HI>Frederike</HI> came to Italie, hee besieged this new builded towne called Alexandria, but was betraied by <HI>Henry</HI> Duke of Bauaria, and Saxonia, so that he escaped hardlie in the habit of a seruant and retur|ned to Germanie. The Emperour renewed his forces againe, and pierced into Italie with a great armie. Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> fled to Venice. <HI>Otto</HI> the Emperours sonne on the other part with a well appointed nauie pursued after him, hauing recei|ued a commandement from his father to attempt nothing against the Venetians vntil his owne comming. But the young man more hardie, then circumspect, encountred with the Venetians, and was ouercome, and taken prisoner. The father for relieuing of his sonne from Captiuitie was content to come to Venice, and in Saint <HI>Marks</HI> Church to craue absolution from Pope <HI>Alexander.</HI> When hee knee|led downe at the Popes feete,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> the proud Pope set his foot vpon the Emperours necke, and abused the words of holy Scripture, <HI>Super aspidem &amp; basiliscum ambulabis, &amp; conculcabis leonem &amp; draconem,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. xci. 13.</NOTE> that is, thou shall walke vpon the Lyon and the Aspe: the young Lyon and the Dragon shalt thou

tread vnder feet. The Emperour answered, <HI>non tibi sed petro,</HI> that is, not to thee but to S. <HI>Peter</HI>: but the proud Pope reply|ed, <HI>Et mihi &amp; petro,</HI> that is both to me and to S. <HI>Peter,</HI> (to wit) thou doest this homage. The Emperour not willing to giue any further occasion of offence held his peace, and so was absolued, and his sonne relieued, with whom hee de|parted from Venice.</P>
<P>After this, some affirme, that he led an armie to Palestina, to fight against the Turks, and that hee prospered, vntill at length he was drowned in a certaine riuer. The Christians in Ierusalem had their last helpe and refreshment from <HI>Phi|lip</HI> king of France, and <HI>Richard</HI> king of England. These two besieged Acon and conquered it. But there was kindled be|tweene the two kings a feruent heat and indignation, euerie one of them enuying the honour of another,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> so that <HI>Philip</HI> returned to France, and king <HI>Richard</HI> after hee had conque|red Ioppo, returned also to England. But by the way hee made ship-wracke, and hardly escaped the perill of drow|ning. And albeit hee disguised himselfe, putting on the habite of a seruant, yet he was knowne and taken prisoner, by the Duke of Austria, and was brought to the Emperour <HI>Henry</HI> the sixt: where hee was detained vntill hee paied the ransome of 10000. pounds money.</P>
<P>After <HI>Baldowine</HI> succeeded <HI>Amalricus</HI> the sixt king of Ie|rusalem. And after him his sonne <HI>Baldowine</HI> the 4. the 7. king of Ierusalem.

He therefore departing from Rome with great discontentment invaded certaine townes belonging to the Chaire of Rome, whereby hee incurred such hatred at the Popes hands, that hee was forth-with excommunicated, and although the Pope hated the of-spring of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixt, yet when the Electors of Germanie condescended to make <HI>Frederike</HI> the sonne of <HI>Henry</HI> Emperour, the Pope agreed thereto, because hee had a more deadly hatred at those who touched the apple of his eye, that is S. <HI>Peters</HI> patrimonio (as they call it) then at any other sort of people.</P>

Hee was by inheritance king of Naples, Apulia, Ca|labria, and Sicilia.

From thence hee passed with his nobles and Princes to Rome, and there with great solemnitie was consecrated &amp; called <HI>Augustus</HI> by Pope <HI>Honorius</HI> the third. After his consecration he gaue by his charter to the Church of Rome the Dukedome of Fundanuus, for by the insatiable couetousnesse of the Roman Bishops this wicked vse and custome grew, that except the Emperours Elected and crowned would giue vnto them such great and large gifts, they could not obtaine of them their consecration and con|firmation, which for that intent they deuised.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> Furthermore the said Emperour willing to shew himselfe more bountiful towards the Church of Rome, gaue and admitted those con|stitutions which the Pope himselfe would desire, by which doing he gaue a sword in their hands to cut his owne throat;
<PB N="137" REF="77">
for hee did grant to the Canon of proscription devised by the Pope and his adherents, that whosoever were excom|municate for diminution of the liberties of the Church, and so continued a yeeres space, that this person should be within the danger of his proscript, and should not bee re|laxed before hee had made satisfaction, and was admitted by the Pope to the Church and Congregation of good men againe.</P>
<P>But this liberty of <HI>Fredericke</HI> was well required by <HI>Hono|norius,</HI> for soone after his returning to Germany, hee heard of certaine who begun to raise and make new factions a|gainst him: amongst whom were found <HI>Thomas</HI> &amp; <HI>Richard,</HI> the brethren of <HI>Innocentius</HI> the third, Earles of Anaquinos, that held certaine Castles in the kingdome of Naples against him by force, which Castles hee besieged and beat downe. <HI>Richard</HI> also hee tooke and sent him prisoner to Sicilia. But <HI>Thomas</HI> escaped and came speedily to Rome, where hee was not onely received by <HI>Honorius,</HI> but also when the Emperor began to expostulate with him for the vnseemlinesse of this deed, the Pope was so chased, that without further delay, he thundred out against him like a tyrant,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> his cursings and ex|communications.</P>
<P>After this fell out a ground of a new debate between the Emperour and the Pope. For the Christians that were in Asia were so weakened, that <HI>Iohn</HI> surnamed <HI>Brennus,</HI> King of Ierusalem came himselfe to the Emperour, and to the Pope to seeke helpe for the distressed Christians, who were in A|sia. This <HI>Iohn</HI> gaue his daughter <HI>Ioel</HI> in mariage to the Em|perour, with the title of the Kingdome of Ierusalem in dowrie with her. The Emperour on the other part promi|sed that with all possible expedition hee would leade an ar|mie into Asia against the Turkes: wherevpon, and by the meanes of <HI>Iohn</HI> King of Ierusalem, the Emperour and the Pope were reconciled againe. But before the Emperour tooke his iourney to Asia, <HI>Honorius</HI> died, in whose roome succeeded <HI>Gregorius</HI> the ninth, who excommunicated the Emperour a new againe, because hee was compelled by sick|nesse
<PB N="138" REF="78">
to come backe from his iourney to Asia, and to re|maine a space in Europe for the recouering of his health againe.</P>
<P>The next yeere after, to stop the mouth of the slanderous and cruell Pope, and to declare to the world, that the last yeere hee did not leave off his iourney by his owne volun|tary will, but by necessity: hee set forward with a great ar|my and arrived at Ioppa. The Saracens were so troubled with his arrivall, that they were content to render to <HI>Frede|ricke</HI> the towne of Ierusalem, with all the possessions that were scituate betweene it and Ptolemaide, and the greatest part of Palestina, and the Cities of Tyrus and Sydon, which were in Syria, and all other territories which <HI>Baldwin</HI> the fourth at any time had occupied there. Also they were con|tent to set at liberty all the prisoners who were in their hands: and finally, to conclude peace for the space of ten yeeres.</P>
<P>In the meanetime, while the Emperour is thus occupied in Asia, Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> the ninth in the Emperours absence, made it knowne to the whole world, for what cause he was so earnest to chase him away to the East: not that he cared for the welfare of the distressed Christians in Asia, but to the end hee might worke him some trouble in his absence,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> as appeared by all these subsequent practices. For hee inva|ded the kingdome of Naples, and the rest of the dominions which pertained to the Emperors inheritage: and subdued a great part of these dominions to himselfe. Likewise he had a secret dealing with <HI>Henry</HI> the Emperours son, to stirre him vp against his father, and prevailed so farre in this divellish treason, that by the Popes counsell hee put from him his trustie Counceller <HI>Ludovicus,</HI> Duke of Boioria, whom his father had ordained to be guider of his sonne in his absence. Likewise when the Emperour sent letters out of Asia decla|ring the good successe that God had given him, and there|with desiring the Pope and Christian Princes and people, to give thanks to God for the same. These letters so grieved the Popes minde, that hee rent them in peeces, cast them
<PB N="139" REF="78">
vpon the ground, and trode them vnder his feet to the great admiration of the Emperours Legats. Againe to colour the rage of his impotent minde with some excuse,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> who could not brid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the fury of his malicious heart, pretending this to be the cause of his anger, because the Emperour amongst other conditions of peace, bound vp betweene the Chri|stians in Asia and the Saracens, hee had licensed them to come (alwayes without armour) to the place of the holy grave. Also hee made rumours to passe through Italy of the Emperours death, to the end the townes which were vnder his dominion, might be faint-hearted, and resigne o|ver their cities into his hands. As likewise the souldiers who returned home out of Asia, he caused to be cut off, left by their reporting the truth, and the good successe of <HI>Fre|dericke,</HI> the townes vnder his obedience might be encou|raged.</P>
<P>The Emperour being advertised of all these practices done against him in his absence, left in Asia <HI>Renaldus</HI> with his garisons, co~manding all the other bands to be vnder his appointment: And with all speed came with certaine gallies to Calabria, and within short space tamed his enemies, and recovered all his holds and dominions againe. Also he sent to the Pope to entreate for his favour, notwithstanding all the iniuries he had received at his hands, but was not heard nor accepted into favour, vntill hee had paied an hundred and twenty ounces of gold, for his absolution.</P>
<P>After this, great rebellon was stirred vp in Germany a|gainst <HI>Fredericke,</HI> for his owne sonne <HI>Henry Caesar</HI> began to vtter the fruits of that old traffique that was betweene him and the Pope, and caused <HI>Ludovicke</HI> Duke of Boiaria, of whom we did speake before, not onely to be put from his Court, but also most cruelly to be murthered. The Empe|rour thought it no time to sleepe: wherefore ent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing into Germany, hee assembled a Councell in the citie of N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur|burg, where the conspiracy of <HI>Henry Caesar</HI> was manifestly detected, whereof the Pope was the chiefe author, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ee by the iudgement and sentence of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Princes, condemned

of high treason. And being commanded by his father to be bound, was as a prisoner brought to Apulia, where not long after hee died in prison. In whose roome hee ordained his third sonne <HI>Conradus Caesar,</HI> by consent of all the Peeres and Princes. Also <HI>Fredericus Austriacus</HI> his sonne, was pro|claimed for an enemy to the Common-wealth, from whom were taken Austria and Stiria, and brought againe vnder the Emperours obedience and fidelity: who having set Ger|many at quietnesse, left there <HI>Conradus Caesar</HI> his sonne, and with his army returned to Italy, to punish such as with <HI>Henry</HI> his eldest sonne had conspired against him, whose treasons were all detected at the condemnation of <HI>Henry Caesar,</HI> and chiefly the Popes, who vnderstanding that the Emperour with warlike furniture marched towards Italy, albeit hee fained himselfe to be reconciled, and a friend to him, yet was hee notwithstanding to him a most secret and intestine enemy. For hee sent to those cities who had con|spired against the Emperour, admonishing them that they should ioyne themselues together, and that they should fur|nish strongly their cities with garrisons, and send for aide to friends, and that with all their force they would prepare themselues for warre. Also hee sent Ambassadors to the Emperour to forbid him and his army to come forward vn|to Italy, and to say vnto him (not by way of entreaty, but imperiously) that what cause of controversie hee had against the Longobards, the same hee should commit to him, and stand to his arbiterment. The Emperour nothing regarding this foolish interditement, prosecuteth his purpose and mar|cheth towards Italy: where he brought vnder his subiecti|on those cities that rebelled against him, as Mantua, Vero|na, Ternisium, Patavium, and others: and then hee after|ward set vpon the great Hoast of Mediolanenses, the Brixi|ans, the Placentines,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> and other confederats, of whom hee tooke a thousand prisoners, and also their Generall, being the chiefe Magistrate in the citie of Mediolanum, <HI>Petrus Te|nopolus</HI> the Dukes sonne of Venice, and slew diverse Cap|taines moe, and tooke all their Ensignes.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="79">The Pope perceiving the overthrow of his confederates, could no longer cover his malice, but did breake out in open fury and rage against the Emperour, and pronoun|ced a sentence of proscription against him, depriving him of all his dignities, honours, titles&punc; prerogatiues, kingdoms, and whole Empire. Also calling vnto him the Venetian and Genuan Legats, made a peace betweene them (for they had beene at variance for certaine causes about their Sea coasts) and covenanted with them vpon this con|dition, that vpon their charges they should rigge and man 35. gallies, which should spoyle and burne all along the Sea coasts of the kingdomes and dominions of <HI>Fredericke.</HI> But when hee saw the good will and fidelity that the Duke of Venice bare vnto the Emperour, who notwithstanding the displeasure he tooke by the imprisonment of his sonne, yet would he not make warre against him. For which cause the Pope had recourse to his old practises, whereby his pre|decessors had trodden all Princes vnder their feet. And so hee put forth an edict at Rome, to the vniversall Church and people, the beginning whereof is, <HI>Ascendit de mari bel|lica bestia</HI>: wherein hee declareth the causes wherefore hee curseth the Emperour to the divell of Hell, and deiecteth him from his Princely dignity: charging him with treason, periury, cruelty, sacrilege, killing of his owne kindred, and all impiety, and accuseth him as an hereticke, schismaticke, and miscreant. And this edict of the Emperours cursing,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> he commanded all Bishops, Prelats, and others of the Cler|gie, that they should solemnly recite the same in their Chur|ches in stead of a Sermon. And furthermore, charged them and all other Christian men, vnder paine of cursing and damnation, that they neither helpe the Emperour, nor yet so much as wish him well.</P>
<P>Moreover, by meanes of <HI>Albertus Bebauus</HI> his Legat, hee stirred vp great rebellion against the Emperor in Germany. For hee drew <HI>Otto</HI> Duke of Boiaria from the Emperours o|bedience, and with him <HI>Venceslaus</HI> and <HI>Belus,</HI> Princes of the Hungarians, and <HI>Henry</HI> Duke of Polonia. To whom
<PB N="142" REF="80">
also <HI>Fredericus Austriacus</HI> the Emperours sonne (because he was proscript or out-lawed of his father) was easily adioy|ned. The Emperour was at Patavium, when these newes were brought to him. Therefore hee commanded <HI>Peter de Vineis</HI> his Secretarie, vpon Easter day to make a narration to the people of his great munificence to the Bishoppes of Rome, and againe of their iniuries towards him in recom|pence thereof: of his innocencie also, in all the heads whereof hee was accused by the Pope: and finally, of the vse of Ecclesiasticall censure, and of the errors and abuse of the Church of Rome. By which Oration of his, he so re|mooved the clowds of blinde superstion from mens hearts, and the conceived opinion of holinesse of the Church of Rome, and also of their vsurped power, and subtle perswa|sion, that both they saw, and plainely perceived the vices and filthinesse of the same. At the same time the Emperour (as faith <HI>Albericus</HI>) writ to the Pope these veres.</P>
<Q><L>Roma diu titubans longis erroribus acta</L>
<L>Corruet, &amp; mundi desinet esse caput.</L></Q>
<P>To whom the Pope answered againe in other verses.</P>
<Q><L>Niteris incassum navem submergere Petri;</L>
<L>Fluctuat, at nunquam mergitur illa ratis.</L></Q>
<P>The Emperour moreover, by his Letters and Legats, gi|veth intelligence to all Christian princes, as well of the fai|ned crimes wherewith he was charged, as also of the cruelty of the Bishop of Rome against him. In all this time it plea|sed God to support the Emperor with some comfort, which many of his Predecessors lacked. For the Bishops of Ger|many were faithfull subiects vnto him, and not onely refu|sed to execute the Popes edicts and mandats in their Chur|ches, but also they accused and condemned <HI>Albertus Beba|vus</HI> the Popes Legat, as a most impudent impostor and a wi~cked fellow, and a most pestiferous botch and sore of the Christian Common-wealth, and gaue him to the Diuell
<PB N="143" REF="80">
as a ruinous enemy as well of the Church, as of his naturall Countrey. This warre betweene the Emperour and the Pope waxed so hot, that vpon a time the Emperour came to Pisas and Viterbium, the Pope fearing hee would come to Rome, caused a supplication to be made, wherein the heads of <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> were carryed about, and with a sharpe and contumelious Oration hee fought to deface the Emperour, promising everlasting life, and giving the badge of the Crosse to so many as would arme themselues and fight a|gainst the Emperour, as against the most wicked enemy of God and his Church. Now the Emperour marching some|what neere the gates of Rome, when hee saw souldiers mar|ked with the badge of the Crosse comming out against him, gaue a sharpe charge vpon them, and put them soone to flight, and as many as he tooke (cutting off that badge from them) he caused to bee hanged. But the more hee prospe|red the more he was enuyed of the Pope, who by his Le|gats, called to a Councell at Rome, all such Prelats out of Italy, France, and England, as hee thought to favour him and his proceedings: that hereby as his last shift and onely refuge, hee by their helps might depriue <HI>Fredericke</HI> of the Empire, as an vtter enemy to God and his Church. Of all which the Emperour having intelligence, and knowing that these assemblies should be but to his destruction, hee determined to stop and let their passages to Rome, both by Sea and Land. And therefore sent out his sonne <HI>Henry</HI> with certaine Gallies, to keepe the coasts of Sardinia, and from thence to Pisas, and with the Pisans to rigge out a Navie to meete with such as should aide the Pope of Rome. The Popes associats on the other part, procured that the gallies and shippes of Genua (having <HI>Guilielmus Braccius</HI> for their chiefe Captaine) should bee sent out for defence of the Pre|lats that were to repaire to the Councell. Thus the Pisan army launched forth to the Sea with forty ships and gallies, and betweene the Isles of Lilium and <HI>Mons Christs,</HI> which lie betweene Liburnium and Corsica, they met with the Ge|nuan ships, and fiercely began to boord them. In which
<PB N="144" REF="81">
fight at length were three of the Genuan shippes sunke and 22. taken and brought away, with all the riches and treasures in them. In those were taken three of the Popes Legats (whereof two were Cardinals) <HI>Iacobus Columna, Ot|tho Marchio,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Gregorius de Romania</HI> (all cruell enemies a|gainst the Emperour) and many other Prelats moe, besides a great number of Legats and Procurators of cities, with an infinit number of Monkes and Priests, as also the Genuan souldiers, with diverse others. Also besides the prey and booty, they found many writings and letters which very much helped the Emperour, in cleering his cause against his enemies.</P>
<P>Whilest this discord was between the Emperour and the Pope, <HI>Orthodarius</HI> the Emperour of the Tartarians, soone invaded the borders next adiacent to him, and conquered Ropolanium, Bodolium, Mudanium, with diverse other townes and villages: destroying, wasting, and burning the countries all about: killing and slaying, men, women, children, sparing none of any sex or age. At whose sudden invasion the people being affrighted and troubled, were glad to leaue all that they had, and disperse themselues into woods, and flie vnto marshes and mountaines: so that by this time the Tartarian Hoste was come as farre as Wratis|lavia, where <HI>Henricus</HI> of Polonia, and the Duke of Silesia met with them, but by reason of inequality both in num|ber and forces, they were easily defeated and slaine. From thence they came to Moravia, and from thence to the king|dome of Bohemia and Hungary, at which time <HI>Belus</HI> King of Hungarie sent to the Emperour for support against the Tartarians, promising that Hungarie ever after should be vn|der the iurisdiction of the Emperour. The Emperour on the other part was most willing to helpe the Hungarians and other Christians, and sent to the Pope to perswade him that hee would take vp and conclude a peace, and mitigate somewhat his wrath, in regarde of the immiment danger like to ensue vpon the whole state of Christendome, by rea|son of a civill dissention.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="81">But when hee saw that by no meanes the Pope would relent his furie, hee was compelled to write againe to the King of Hungarie, that hee could stand him in no stead at that time, because the Bishop of Rome refused all trea|tie of peace: notwithstanding hee sent <HI>Conradus Caesar</HI> king of Bohemia, and other Princes of Germame to resist and withstand the enemie so farre as in them lay. Thus may bee seene the louing zeale and affection that the Pope of Rome hath toward Christian people, that hee had rather bend his forces to revenge his malice vpon the Christian and good Emperour, then either by himselfe to withstand, or yet by concluding a profitable peace to permit others to withstand the most bloodie and cruell Tartarian. But euen in the midst of this spoyle and havock of Polonia, Bohemia, and Hungaria, was it determined that <HI>Libussa</HI> the Princes confederate with the Pope should bee assem|bled about the deposing of the Emperour,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> and creating of another. When <HI>Frederike</HI> saw there was none other re|medie and that hee laboured in vaine to haue peace, hee prosecuted the warre to the vttermost, and when hee had gotten Tudetum and reconciled the same, hee destroyed the Townes of Geminium and Naruia and gaue the spoyle of them to his souldiers, hee gentlie receiued the yeelding vp of Siburnium and wasted all the countrey about Rome: wherewith the Pope being dismaied, and seeing that things prospered not so well with him against the Emperour as he looked for, being in dispaire of obtaining his purpose died in great anger and displeasure.</P>
<P>Thus when the author of all this conspiracie was gone, The Emperour with his armie marched forward against the Tartarians who hearing of his comming left the straigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+way through Hungarie by which they came, and returned by the riuer of Danubium to Taurica, and so through the Fenns of Meotida and by the riuer of Tanaium into Sar|matia Asiatica.</P>
<P>After <HI>Gregorie Celestinus</HI> was created Pope who died with|in 18. daies after, to whom succeeded <HI>Innocentius.</HI> In whose
<PB N="146" REF="82">
time the Emperour hoped for peace but was disappointed; for albeit a day was appointed for their meeting together at Festennia, and the Pope had promised that hee would be there before the Emperour and expect his comming, yet hee mocked the Emperour, and secretly in the night tooke ship and first came to Genua, and from thence to Lyons in Fraunce where hee gathered a councell and excommunica|ted the Emperour. Notwithstanding the Emperour was determinate to goe to Lyons himselfe, and to conferre with the Pope, both concerning this sentence pronounced a|gainst him, as also about the conclusion of peace, if by any meanes it could be obtained. But as he was vpon his iour|ney newes was brought to him that Parma was taken by his out lawes assisted by the Popes Legat, wherefore being out of hope of peace, he set himselfe againe to the warre, and besieged Parma planting ouer against it the forme of a towne, which he called Victoria, wherein his Souldiers cam|ped. But the citizens of Parma getting knowledge vpon a time that the Emperour was gone to hunting and his soul|diers were stragling here and there without order, issued out of the towne, and slew a great number of them, and burnt his Campe <HI>Victoria.</HI> Soone after the Emperour being in Apulia in a certaine Castle called Florentinium, ended his life.</P>
<P>In this time it is to be noted that there was such dissenti|on betweene the Emperour and the Pope that the facti|ous names of the Guelfes and Gibelins sprang vp in Italie,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> and continued euer since, almost to our owne dayes, for the Guelfes followed the Pope, the Gibelins the Empe|rour, so that it came to passe that all they who followed the Pope were called by the name of Guelfes, and these who followed the Emperour, Gibelins.</P>

to performe, and in the yeere of our Lord 1248. after he had receiued the Popes blessing at Lyons, set forward with a mightie armie hauing in companie with him the Earle Atrabacensis his brother the Duke of Burgundy, the Duke of Brabant, the Countesse of Flanders with her two sonnes, the Earle of Britanie with his sonne, the Earle of Barrensis, the Earle of Swesson, the Earle of S. Paul, the Earle of Druise, the Earle Retel, with many other noble Persons.</P>
<P>In the beginning of this enterprise they seemed to pros|per well, for they tooke the Towne of Damiata at their first arriuall into Aegypt, which was the chiefe seat and hold of the Saracens in all Aegypt. At the losse whereof the Soldan of Aegypt with the Saracens in those parts were so astonished, that they offered the Christians the possession of Ierusalem, and the holy Land, which the Christians so much contended for, prouiding they would render vnto them againe the Towne of Damiata. But the Earle of Ar|toys, the kings brother puft vp with insolent pride would in no waies suffer the offers of the Saracens to be accepted, but required also Alexandria the chiefe Metropolitan towne of Aegypt to be deliuered vnto them. But soone after the Soldan of Aegypt beset them so stronglie, both by Sea and Land, that they were glad to craue againe the peace which was offered and could not obtaine it. In the ende they were purposed to leaue a Garrison to keepe Damiata, and to march out in battell themselues. The Earle of Artoys through his insolent pride (thinking all was his owne when|soeuer he gat any small aduantage of the enemie) brought himselfe and all the armie to confusion, for he passed ouer a shallow foord of Nilus which a certaine Saracen lately con|verted to Christ had made knowne, and hauing in company with him the Master of the Temple, and <HI>William Longspath,</HI> with his companie of English souldiers and diuers others, euen the third part of the armie, set vpon the Saracens when they were not aware, and did them great harme. This victo|rie obtained he would needs goe forward, deuiding him|selfe
<PB N="153" REF="85">
from the maine Hoast and besieged the Castle, and Village of Mansor. But the Saracens finding him separated from the rest of the army, compassed him about, and de|stroyed him and all his company, in so much that scarce one man escaped aliue (except two Templars, one Hospi|tular, and one poore Souldier) to bring newes thereof to the King. After this the Souldan suddenly appeared with multitude of innumerable thousands, against the King him|selfe. In this miserable conflict the King with his two bre|thren, and a few that claue vnto him were taken captiues, all the residue were put to the sword, or else stood to the mercy of the Saracens, whether to bee slaine or remaine in wofull captivity.</P>
<P>The Souldan after the captivity of the King, fraudulent|ly suborned an army of Saracens to the number of the French army, with the armes and ensignes of them that were slaine, and sent them toward Damiata, where the Duke of Burgundie with the French Queene, and <HI>Odo</HI> the Popes Legat and other Bishops, and their garrisons were remai|ning, supposing vnder the shew of Frenchmen to be let in. But the Captaines mistrusting their hasty comming, and misdoubting their visages not like to the French-mens, shut the gates against them, whereby they returned frustrate of their purpose. Yet afterward Damiata was rendered to the Saracens as a part of the Kings ransome, which citie being twice won, and twice lost by the Christians, the Souldan afterward caused vtterly to be razed downe to the ground. It is to bee noted in this Tragedy,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> that the Pope of Rome was the chiefe ground of all this lamentable calamity. For the King wisely considering what great helpe hee might haue gotten by the concurrance of the valiant and wife Em|perour <HI>Fredericke,</HI> travailed for reconciliation between him and the Pope, before hee vndertooke his voyage, but all his travails were spent in vaine, and so the King of France went alone to this dangerous enterprise, taking with him the Popes blessing, as is sayd before.</P>
<P>But like as <HI>Fredericke</HI> before prospered not the worse thate
<PB N="154" REF="86">
he was cursed of the Pope, so it may be perceived that <HI>Lewis</HI> King of France prospered not the better, albeit the Pope blessed him. Before wee speake of the sixt voyage of his age it is to marked, that God raised vp <HI>Mango</HI> King of the Tartarians to make warre against the Saracens: he was bap|tised and professed the name of Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mango</HI> King of the Tarta|rians fighteth against the Saracens.</NOTE> and sent his brother <HI>Hal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> to fight against the Saracens. Who overhailed Persia, Assyria, Mesopotamia, and in the end came to Syria, and conquered Damascus, appointing his sonne <HI>Abaga</HI> to bee Governour of the same, for hee returned himselfe to inhe|rit the kingdome of his brother <HI>Mango,</HI> whom hee heard to be dead. Also <HI>Abaga</HI> afterward hearing of the death of his father <HI>Halo,</HI> returned to gouerne his fathers kingdome, lea|ving behinde him ten thousand horsemen to support the Christians, in the hands of <HI>Guirboca,</HI> who also favoured the Christians for a time, vntil they slew his Nephew, and then hee also became an enemie vnto them, and invaded the towne of Caesarea, and set it on fire.</P>
<P>At this time <HI>Nelethinus</HI> the sonne of <HI>Turqueminius,</HI> Soul|dan of Egypt, fearing the dominion of the Tartarians in Sy|ria, provoked <HI>Guirboca</HI> to fight, and destroyed him and his army: and they that escaped of the Tartarians fled to Ar|menia. Thus the small comfort which the Christians had by the Tartarians, was first turned into hatred, and after|ward was vtterly taken away by their destruction.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The sixt army.</NOTE>The sixt voyage was vnder the King of France, and <HI>Hen|rie</HI> King of England, who sent Prince <HI>Edward</HI> his sonne to Palestina in his place, and <HI>Charles</HI> Duke of Angeow, who was declared by the Pope to be King of Sicile, and King of Ierusalem. In this voyage the one part of the army, to wit, French-men, arrived at Africa and besieged the towne of Carthage and tooke it: also they besieged Tuenetum sixe moneths, at which time the army was troubled with a grie|vous pestilence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A peace con|cluded.</NOTE> whereof the King himselfe, and the Popes Legat both died. But <HI>Charles</HI> King of Sicile came with a fresh army: <HI>Mulet</HI> the Prince in those parts, entreated for peace, which was granted vpon these conditions. First, that
<PB N="155" REF="86">
if any in Africke would professe the Christian religion, they should bee permitted so to doe without molestation. Next, that the Christians who were detained in captivity should be set at liberty. And thirdly, that there should bee payd yeerely to the King of Sicile forty thousand crownes.</P>
<P>The other part of the army vnder the conduct of <HI>Edward</HI> Prince of England, came to Syria, where <HI>Edward</HI> was cir|cumvented by a deceitfull Saracen, who came with letters to him from his master, and wounded him with an inve|nomed knife, whereby hee was in great danger of his life, but being cured by skilfull Physitians, he escaped death. Al|so hee staied in Ptolemais vpon the arrivall of the rest of the army out of Africke, but when hee had long waited in vaine, hee was compelled to returne back againe to his owne countrey.</P>
<P>In this voyage it is to be noted, that the Pope of Rome miserably abused the Christian people: for the armies rai|sed against the Turkes and Infidels,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> hee caused to serue the covetous appetite of his bloody heart, as plainely appeareth in the French army which <HI>Guido</HI> Bishop of Altisiodorum conducted to Viterbium: <HI>Vrbanus Quartus</HI> sent his army a|gainst <HI>Manfred</HI> King of Sicile, to subdue vnto him Sicilia, and to roote out the ofspring of <HI>Fredericke,</HI> which he dead|ly hated; and when this enterprise succeeded not to his hearts contentment, <HI>Clemens</HI> his successor stirred vp this <HI>Charles</HI> Duke of Angeow, who vsurped the kingdome of Sicile, destroyed the posterity of <HI>Fredericke,</HI> and at the Popes desire vndertooke this voyage to Asia, whereof wee haue last spoken.</P>
<P>The seventh voyage of this age, was vndertaken by the Emperour <HI>Rodolph,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The 7. army.</NOTE> who according to his promise made to Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> the tenth, was willing to raise an ar|my and succour the Christians in Asia, but hee was so im|peded by the warres hee had with the King of Bohemia, that hee could not in his owne person goe to Syria, but hee sent <HI>Henrie</HI> Prince of Mechelburg with a strong army to supply his place, who comming to Ptolemais wasted and

burnt with fire the region round about Damascus. The Barbarians durst not encounter with him in open battell, but circumvened him, and vpon a time as hee was leading away a great prey, they lying in wait for him, arose and brought him to the Souldan: where hee was detained in captivitie 26. yeeres. After this the Christians in Asia were brought to vtter wracke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Christi|ans vtterly de|stroyed in Asia.</NOTE> for the Saracens invaded Antio|chia and tooke it, and destroyed the Christians there. After|ward vnder the conduct of <HI>Aphir</HI> their Souldan, they be|sieged Tripolis and tooke it, and razed it to the ground. Also Tyrus was rendered vpon condition that the Christi|ans there should safely depart with so much of their sub|stance as they could transport with shippes, or drawe with beasts. And finally, all the townes and holds which the Christians had in Syria, were taken by the Saracens, onely Ptolemais excepted, which afterward was taken by <HI>Araphus</HI> the Souldan, the Christians therein being put to the sword, and the citie it selfe vtterly razed to the ground, in such sort that there was not so much as a monument of it left vn|destroyed.</P>
<P>Now when all was lost,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> the Christians obtained some new and fresh comfort by the conversion of <HI>Cassanus</HI> Prince of the Tartarians, to the Christian religion, who expelled the Saracens out of Syria, and repayred the temple and towne of Ierusalem, and restored it to the Christians, and set at liberty <HI>Henry</HI> Prince of Mechelburg, who had been detained captiue a long time.

<P>_IN the yeare of our Lord 1486. <HI>Fredericus</HI> waxing aged, and partly also mistrusting the hearts of the Germaines, did in his life-time associate his sonne <HI>Maximili|an</HI> to be ioyned Emperor with him, with whom he reigned for the space of 7. yeers till the death of <HI>Fredericke</HI> his father, after whose departure he reigned 25. yeers. This <HI>Maximilian</HI> as he was a valiant Emperor, prudent and singularly learned, so was his raigne intangled in many vnquiet and difficult warres. First in the lower Countries of Flanders and Bra|bant, where he was taken captiue,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Maximilian</HI> ta|ken prisoner, &amp; relieved by his father.</NOTE> but worthily againe relie|ved by his father.

<P>AFter <HI>Maximilian, Charles</HI> King of Spaine, Duke of Au|stria and Burgundie, and nephew to <HI>Maximilian,</HI> was chosen Emperour, and raigned 37. yeeres. He was a Prince of singular wisedome, expert in warre, slow to wrath, and if it had pleased the Lord to haue illuminated his heart with that true light that begun to shine in his time, hee might haue beene reckoned amongst the most renowned Empe|rours. His inclination to wisedome may appeare by these witty sentences vttered by him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sentenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|tered by <HI>Caro|lus quintus.</HI></NOTE> Like as Saturne which is counted the most supreme planet, hath the slowest course of all the rest, even so they that are in supreme authority, ought to doe all things with greatest deliberation and advisement.

And like as the eclipse of the Sunne is a foretoken of great commotions, so likewise the errors and oversights of Princes bring with them great perturbations to coun|tries. Hee was intangled with great and dangerous warres all the time of his government, either against forraine Prin|ces, or some of the Empire. In his warrs against the King of France, hee had better successe then he could haue looked for, for as much as the towne of Millaine being already ta|ken by the King of France, and the towne of Pavie in Italy likewise besieged, yet the Emperours army shortly after en|countred with the French-men, and both vanquished them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He subdueth the Frenchme~ &amp; taketh their King prisoner.</NOTE> and also tooke the King himselfe prisoner, and from thence conveyed him away to Spaine, where through care and griefe hee fell into sicknesse, but when hee was comforted by the Emperour, and put in some hope of agreement, hee began to take heart vnto him and recovered: and in the end a peace was agreed vpon at Madruce in Spaine, and the

King was set at liberty, leaving for pledges his two eldest sonnes. But shortly after hee revoked his oath, being absol|ved by the Bishop of Rome, and said he was forced to swear or else hee should never haue beene delivered.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The begin|ning of refor|mation of reli|gion in Ger|many by <HI>Mar|tin Luther.</HI></NOTE>In this Emperours dayes begun reformation of religion in Germany, by meanes of the disputations, writings, and doctrine of <HI>Martin Luther,</HI> whom the Emperour laboured by all meanes to suppresse. First, by gathering a convention of the estates of Germany, in the towne of Worms. Which convention was kept in the yeere of our Lord 1521. and <HI>Martin Luther</HI> being cited by an Herald of armes to ap|peare before the said Councell, with a letter of safe conduct by the Emperour and Princes, appeared: and although ma|ny perswaded him not to adventure himselfe to such a pre|sent danger,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He appeareth at the conven|tio~ of Worms.</NOTE> yet <HI>Luther</HI> answered that he was resolved, and certainely determined to enter Worms, in the name of our Lord Iesus Christ, although hee knew that there were so many divells to resist him, as there were tyles to cover the houses in Wormes: thus being presented before all the E|states of the Empire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Questions propounded by <HI>Eccius.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Iohn Eccius</HI> (who then was the Bishop of Triers generall officiall) at the Emperours command de|manded of <HI>Martin</HI> two questions. First, whether hee con|fessed
<PB N="173" REF="95">
those bookes which were given out vnder his name to be his or no, shewing herewith an heape of <HI>Luthers</HI> bookes written in the Latin and Dutch tongues. Secondly, whether hee would revoke and recant them, or stand to all that hee had written.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Answered by <HI>Luther.</HI></NOTE> To the first point hee answered affirmatiuely, that hee would acknowledge his owne bookes. As touch|ing the second, whether he would recant any thing contai|ned in his bookes or no, he craved time to premeditate what hee should speake in that matter: which was the more easily granted, because they were in some hope that <HI>Luther</HI> would recant some of his writings, but it fell out farre otherwise then they looked for. For at the time of his next appearance hee divided his bookes into three sorts,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Luther</HI> vrged to recant some things vvhich he had writ|ten, refuseth.</NOTE> some of them ope|ned the grounds of Christian religion simply, which his very enemies had counted inculpable, and therefore hee would not condemne them himselfe. Another sort contai|ned invectiues against the Papacie, and others of that retinue which had with their pestiferous doctrine and pernitious examples, corrupted the whole estate of Christianity, which bookes if hee should revoke, hee should adde more force to their tyranny, and his retraction should be a cloake and sha|dow to all their impiety and naughtinesse. The third sort of his bookes were written against certaine particular per|sons, who with tooth and naile laboured to maintaine the Romane tyranny, and to deface his doctrine, and these like|wise hee could not recall, left by his recantation it should come to pasle, that tyranny and impiety supported by his meanes should rage more violently against the people, then ever it did before. When no recantation could be obtained, nor yet submission of his writings to the iudgement of the Emperour, and his Estates: <HI>Martin Luther</HI> departed from Wormes, being dismissed according to his promise of his safe conduct, and returned to his owne countrey.</P>
<P>Soone after this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Empe|rours decre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> against <HI>Luther.</HI></NOTE> the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> to purchase fa|vour with the Pope (because hee was not yet confirmed in his Empire) provideth and directeth out a solemne writ of outlawry against <HI>Luther</HI> and all them that take his part,

commanding the said <HI>Luther,</HI> where-ever hee might be got|ten, to be apprehended and his bookes burned.</P>
<P>After this another convention of the Estates of Germa|nie was gathered at Norinberg for the suppressing of <HI>Mar|tin Luther,</HI> to which Councell Pope <HI>Adrian</HI> the sixt, sent his Ambassadour <HI>Cheregatus,</HI> to desire that the sentence of the Apostolick Sea, and the Emperours edict against <HI>Mar|tin Luther</HI> should bee put in execution.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The procee|dings of the convention of Norinberg a|gainst <HI>Luther.</HI></NOTE> The Princes of Germany on the other part, declared great vrgent causes wherefore they were compelled to forbeare the execution of those decrees for a time, and namely for this, that the greatest part of Germany haue alwayes had this perswa|sion, that great inconvenience hath come to this Nation by the Court of Rome: and now if they should proceede with rigour in executing the Popes sentence, and the Em|perours edict, the people would suspect in their mindes, this to bee done for supporting and confirming the former abuses, whereupon great warres and tumults (no doubt) would ensue. For the avoyding whereof, they thought to vse more gentle remedies serving better for the time. Also seeing the Pope by his foresaid Ambassadour desired to be informed what way were best to take, in resisting those er|rours of the Lutherans: The Estates answered, that if the Popes holinesse with consent of the Emperours Maiestie, should gather a free Christian Councell in some conve|nient place of Germanie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Princes of Germanies iudgement concerning the suppression of <HI>Luthers</HI> at|tempts.</NOTE> and that with such speed as conue|niently might bee, it were in their iudgement the rea|diest way to suppresse the attempts of <HI>Luther</HI>: and in the meane time vntill the Councell might bee set, they had provided wayes to stay the tumults of the Germaine people.</P>
<P N="1">1. First, by dealing with the Noble Prince <HI>Fredericke</HI> Duke of Saxony, that <HI>Luther</HI> nor his followers shall not write, set foorth, or print any thing during the saide space.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Item,</HI> that the Princes shall labour so with the Prea|chers of Germany, that they shall not in their Sermons
<PB N="175" REF="96">
teach or blow into the peoples eares such matters, where|by the multitude may bee mooved to rebellion or vprore, or bee induced vnto errour, and that they shall preach or teach nothing but the true, pure, sincere, and holy Gos|pell, and approoved Scripture, according to the exposi|tion approoved and received of Christs Church.</P>
<P N="3">3. And finally, as concerning Priests that contract Ma|trimony, and religious men leaving their Cloysters, for as much as in the civill law there is no penalty for them or|dained, they shall bee referred to the Canonicall constituti|ons, to be punished thereafter accordingly: that is by losse of their benefices and priviledges, or other condigne censures.</P>
<P>Amongst others things done at this assembly of Norin|berg,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An 100. grie|vances collec|ted by the Germaines, and exhibited to the Bishop of Rome.</NOTE> certaine grievances were collected to the number of an hundreth, and exhibited to the Bishoppe of Rome, wherewith the countrey of Germanie was grieved, as namely, that many things were prohibited by mens Con|stitutions, which are not prohibited by any Commande|ment of God, and many things were exacted which are not commanded by any precept of God.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> that the Popes indulgences and pardons bee most importable, perswading simple people of a remission of sinnes, <HI>a poena &amp; culpa,</HI> and that not in this life onely, but after this life: through the hope and occasion whereof, true piety is almost extinct in all Germany, whilest every e|vill disposed person promiseth to himselfe for a little mony licence and impunity to doe what him listeth, whereupon followeth fornication, incest, adultery, periury, homicide, robbing and spoyling, rapine, vsurie, with a whole flood of mischiefes.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> that whosoever hath received Ecclesiasticall orders, doth contend to bee free from all punishment of the secu|lar Magistrate, how great soever his offence be which hee committeth.</P>
<P>Also, that in many places the Bishoppes and their Offi|cialls doe not onely suffer Priests to haue concubines, so
<PB N="176" REF="97">
that they pay certaine summes of money, but also com|pell continent and chaste Priestes to pay tribute for concu|bines, which being paid, it shall bee lawfull for them either to liue chaste or otherwise, as it shall please them.</P>
<P>These with many mo, to the number of an 100. the secular States of Germanie delivered to the Popes Legat, desiring him to present them to Pope <HI>Adrian.</HI> But Pope <HI>Adrian</HI> died about the same time, and Pope <HI>Clemens</HI> the seventh succee|ding in his place, sent downe his Legat Cardinall <HI>Cam|peius,</HI> vnto the Councell of Germane Princes assembled againe at Norinberg the next Convention, with letters to Duke <HI>Fredericke</HI> full of many faire petitions and sharpe complaints. But as touching the grievances aboue menti|oned, no word at all was sent.</P>
<P>Thus was the Pope ever ready with all diligence to call vpon Princes to suppresse <HI>Luther,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> and the liberty of the Gospell. But when any redresse or reformation of the Church was craved, hereto the Pope neither gaue eare nor answer.</P>
<P>In these Councels of Norinberg it is to bee noted, that the execution of the sentence of <HI>Leo,</HI> and the Empe|rours edict made at Wormes against <HI>Luther</HI> was suspended for a time; and many other things that were desired by the Popes Legate to bee enacted in a full Councell, and with consent of all the Empire, yet could not bee brought to passe, by reason that the mindes of divers were gone from the Pope. For this cause <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Emperours bro|ther, with <HI>Campeius</HI> and the Cardinall of Salisburg,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A conventicle at Ratisbone, wherein arti|cles were rati|fied for sup|pressing of <HI>Lu|thers</HI> doctrine.</NOTE> the two Dukes of Bavaria, the Bishops of Trent and Ratis|bone, also the Legates of the Bishops of Bamberg, Spires, Stransbrugh, Ausbrugh, Constance, Basile, Frising, Pas|savie, and Brixine, assembled themselues together in a par|ticular Conventicle at Ratisbone, and there ratified all the articles which they had hatched amongst themselues for suppressing of <HI>Luthers</HI> doctrine.</P>
<P N="1">1. First, that the edict of the Emperour made at Worms should be observed in all their precincts.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="177" REF="97">2. That the Gospell, and all other holy Scriptures shall be taught according to the interpretation of the auncient forefathers.</P>
<P N="3">3. That in the Sacraments of the Masse, and in all other things, no invocation shall be, but all things shall stand as before time they did.</P>
<P N="4">4. That all that approach to the Lords Supper without confession and absolution, or doe eate flesh on dayes forbid|den, or which doe runne out of their order, also Priests that be married shall be punished.</P>
<P N="5">5. That no Booke of <HI>Luther</HI> or Lutheran shall be Prin|ted or sold.</P>
<P N="6">6. That they of their iurisdiction, which studie in the V|niversitie of Wirtenberge, shall euery one repaire home within three moneths after the publishing hereof, or els turne to some other place free from the infection of <HI>Luther,</HI> vnder paine of confiscating all their goods, &amp; loosing their heritage.</P>
<P N="7">7. That no Benefice or other office of teaching be giuen to any Student of that Vniversitie; with diverse other Arti|cles conteined at greater length in the commentaries of <HI>Iohn Slendan.</HI></P>
<P>After this other two Conventions were kept at Spiers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two conven|tions at Spiers with a rehear|sall of those things which were conclu|ded.</NOTE> In the first were exhibited to the Princes many billes of re|quest, that Monkes and Fryers might be no more in place of them that died, and that the priviledges of the Clergie might be taken away, as lets of ciuill administration, that certaine holy dayes might be abolished, that choice of meats and ceremonies might be free. And finally, seeing there was no hope of a generall Councell, that either the Empe|rour would appoint a Provinciall Councell in Germany for matters of Religion, or els cause the decree of Wormes to cease. At this time the Bishops would not suffer any matter of Religion to be handled, and therefore the Duke of Saxonie, and the Landgraue would haue departed. At last it was decreed, that either a generall or provinciall coun|cell should be had within the space of a yeare, and in the
<PB N="178" REF="98">
meane time the decree of Wormace Councell to cease. In the next Councell kept at Spire, where <HI>Ferdinand</HI> Ambas|sadour in the Emperours name was present, certaine Citties were greatly blamed for altering Religion, contrary to the Emperours commandement; and the Ambassadour for the Citie of Argentine was not suffered to sit in the Councell, because that Cittie had disanulled the Masse. Shortly after by the assent of a few Princes, these points were decreed.</P>
<P>That such Cities as had altered Religion should make no further change.</P>
<P>That other places should obey the decree of Wormes vn|till a generall Councell.</P>
<P>That it should be lawfull to all men who would vse the masse, euen in those Citties where it was abolished.</P>
<P>That the Anabaptists should be punished by death. That the doctrine of the Lords supper shuld not be receiued.</P>
<P>That the Ministers should teach according to the inter|pretation of the Church.</P>
<P>That the Princes and Cities should not receiue foreiners comming for Religion into their dominions, if any man did otherwise, he should be proscript.</P>
<P>The Duke of Saxonie, <HI>George</HI> Prince of Brandenburgh, <HI>Erneste</HI> and <HI>Francisse,</HI> Princes of Luneburg, and the Land|graue of Hesse, and a Prince called <HI>Anhaldius,</HI> withstood this decree, and answered to euery point thereof, saying that the consent of a few could not vndoe that decree which before was made at Spire by the whole Empire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A protestati|on against the decrees of the a conventions of Spire.</NOTE> and there|fore that they all made protestation, that they would not ac|knowledge it. And of this protestation were those Princes, and all that allied with them called Protestants, which name is now giuen to all them that in their doctrine swerue from the Bishop of Rome.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whence the name Prote|stants was deriued.</NOTE></P>
<P>To the Princes aboue-named, these Cities following did agree, Argentine, Norinberg, Vlmes, Constance, Ruteling, Winsemium, Mening, Lindan, Campodune, Hailbrune, Isna, Wiseborough, Norling Sangall. All these Cities with the Princes refused the act of Spire, &amp; appealed to the Em|perour,
<PB N="179" REF="98">
and to a generall or provinciall Councell. After the breaking vp of this Councell, the Protestants send Ambassa|dours to the Emperour, to declare the causes of their appel|lation from the Councell of Spire.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prote|stants Ambas|sadors rough|ly en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">reated by the Empe|rour.</NOTE> The Emperour at this time was in Italie, and on his iourney to Rome to be crow|ned with the Emperiall Diadem by Pope <HI>Clement</HI> the se|uenth; who hauing heard the Ambassadours of the Prote|stants, entreated them roughly and sent them backe againe with menacing words, threatning to punish with all rigour those that would not be obedient to the Decree of the fore|said Convention of Spire.</P>
<P>This was the first ground that moued the Protestants in the conventio~ of Smalcaldy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A league a|mongst the Protestants.</NOTE> to bind vp a couenant amongst themselues of mutuall ayde, if any of them were pursued for Religions sake, as shall be declared afterward, God willing. In the meane time, the Citie of Argentine entreated league with Tigure, Berne, and Basill (who being not farre distant might be more helpfull each to other) that if they were in|vaded for the quarrell of Religion, they should mutually as|sist one another, wherewith the Councell of the Empire were much grieued, and found great fault with them. After the Emperours returning from Italie, where he was crow|ned with the Emperiall Diadem, and had sworne to be a de|fender of the Roman Church, a solemne conuention of the Estates of the Empire was kept in the Towne of Angusta, or S. Ausbrugh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A convention at Ausbrugh.</NOTE> to which were brought many learned di|uines. The Protestants brought with them <HI>Philip Melanch|ton, Iustus Ionas, Georgius Spalatinus, Iohannes Agricola, Isle|bius,</HI> and diverse others. The Romane Church had for their part Cardinall <HI>Campeius,</HI> the Popes Ambassadour, <HI>Eccius, Iohannes Faber Cochleus,</HI> and many others. The Emperour commanded the Princes of the Protestants to come to Masse with him, and to command their Preachers to silence, but they answered, they would neither come to Masse, nor in|ioyne their Preachers to silence, before the matter was con|cluded. Onely the Duke of Saxonie after deliberation with his Divines, was content at the Emperours commandement
<PB N="180" REF="99">
(according to his dutie) to carrie the Sword before him as he went to the Church. Then the Emperour vnder great perill commanded both the parties to silence, and he by pre|rogatiue appointed certaine to Preach that should touch no Controversie.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prote|stants obtaine their confessi|on of faith to be openly read.</NOTE>In this Convention the Protestants offered vnto the Em|perour a copie of the Articles of their Faith, which with great difficultie they obtained to be openly read before they delivered it into the Emperours handes. This Confession commonly called <HI>Augustana Confessio,</HI> was exhibited to <HI>Ec|cius</HI> and <HI>Faber,</HI> Divines on the contrary part, to be confuted, and the copie of this confutation was also openly read. But when the Protestants desired that they might answere to it, the Emperour would not grant it, saying, he would heare no more disputation, but willed them to returne to the Catho|lique Church.</P>
<P>Also the Citizens of Argentine, Constance, Mening, and Lindan (who differed from the other Protestants in the o|pinion of the Sacrament) did in like manner exhibite a con|fession of their Doctrine: a confutation of this Booke also was made by <HI>Eccius</HI> and <HI>Faber,</HI> with very bitter and sharpe words; but the other partie could not haue licence to reply, nor any sight of the copie but as they heard it read. After this, three were chosen on each side to debate matters of Re|ligion, where although <HI>Melanchton</HI> granted more then his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ellowes would haue him, yet nothing was agreed, because that <HI>Eccius</HI> and his two Lawyers, who were chosen for the Romane Church, stucke so fast by their Masse and Monasti|call Vowes, that in those things they would admit no refor|mation.</P>
<P>In the end the Emperour published a Decree, wherein he declared, that although the confession of the Protestants was sufficiently confuted, yet he would giue them respite for a time, to returne to the Church of Rome. In which time they should keepe peace, and alter nothing of Religion, and suffer all that would to follow the Church of Rome. But the Princes and Protestant Cities answered, that they could
<PB N="181" REF="99">
not keepe that Decree with safe consciences.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Princes &amp; Protestant Citties refuse to obey the Emperours Decree con|cerning the retur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing to the Church of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ome. Another De|cree of the Emperour.</NOTE> Thus was the Emperours interim refused, wherefore he set forth another Decree, wherein he confirmed the Doctrine of the Church of Rome in all points, and abrogated all manner of appella|tions made by the Protestants. It appointed also an order how the Emperours Court, called the Chamber, should pro|ceed in iudgement against the Protestants, and forbidded that any Prince of that sect should beare any office in the Court, and all that were of the faith of the Romane Church to be taken into the protection of the Emperour against their owne Princes. This act caused great feare, wherefore the Princes and Ambassadours of the Protestants shortly af|ter met againe at Smalcal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Princes and Ambassa|dours of the Protestants meet at Smal|caldie, and en|ter league to ayde one ano|ther.</NOTE> and went through with the League which they had begunne the yeare before, to ayde each other in the quarrell of Religion.</P>
<P>About this time the Emperour hauing sure information, that the Turke with great preparation, was setting forward his armie against Vienna in Austrich, begun somewhat to relent of his rigour, and through the intercession of the Bi|shop of Mentz, and the Palsgraue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace granted by the Empe|rour to the Protestants.</NOTE> granted peace to the Protestants, so that they should ayde the Emperour against the Turks, and on the other part the action of the Chamber|court should cease in all sutes of Religion against the Prote|stants.

Vpon this the Magistrates and Senate of Zurik, sent forth their commandement to all Priests &amp; Ministers within their Dominion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A disputation at Zurike.</NOTE> to repaire to the Citie of Zurik against the 29. of Ianuarie next ensuing; there euery one to speake freely, and to be heard quietly touching those Controversies of Religi|on.

Articles, which he had
<PB N="182" REF="100">
published also abroad before, to the end that they who were disposed might resort thither better prepared for disputati|on. The Bishop of Constance sent thither <HI>Iohannes Faber Stapulensis</HI> his Vicegerent; who in stead of disputation, rea|soned that this was no convenient place for disputation, but rather the handling of Controversies in Religion belonged to a generall Councell, which he said was alreadie appoin|ted, and nigh at hand.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The decree of the Senate of Zurik concer|ning the abo|lishing of mens traditi|ons, and pure|ly Preaching of the Gospel.</NOTE>Wherevpon the Senate of Zurik caused incontinent to be proclaimed through all their Dominions and Territories, that the traditions of men should be displaced and abando|ned, and the Gospell of Christ purely taught out of the old and new Testament.</P>
<P>When the Gospell begun thus to flourish in Zurik: the yeare next following, Anno 1524. another assemblie of the Helvetians was convented at Lucerna, where Decrees were made on the contrary part;<NOTE PLACE="marg">An assemblie of the Helve|tians at Lu|cerna, contra|ry to that of Zurike.</NOTE> that no man should deride the Masse; that no mention should be made of <HI>Luther,</HI> or any new doctrine; that Pictures and Images of Saints in euery place should be kept inviolate: and finally, that all the lawes and decrees set forth by the Bishop of Constance should be obserued.</P>
<P>After these things thus concluded at Lucerna, the Can|tones of Helvetia together direct their publique Letter to the Tygurines, or men of Zurik, complaining that they had receiued a new Doctrine, which would be the seed of dis|cord, whereas before time all things were in quiet.

The day and yeare when this reformation with them beganne from Popery to true Christianitie, they caused in a pillar to be engrauen in Golden letters, for a perpetuall memorie to all posteritie to come. This was Anno 1528. The rumour of this disputation and alteration of Berne was noysed in o|ther Citties and places abroad; and others were encouraged by this occasion, to take the like order within their bounds, and namely the Townes of Strousbrough, and Basile, and Geneua. All this time by the providence of God, the Em|perour and the King of France were together occupied in

Warres and strife, which hapned very commodiously for the successe of the Gospell: for otherwise it is to be thought that the Helvetians and other Germanes should not haue had that leisure and rest to reforme Religion, and to linke themselues in league as they did: albeit, <HI>Ferdinandus</HI> the Emperours brother and Deputie in Germanie omitted no time nor diligence to doe what he could in resisting the pro|ceedings of the Protestants: as appeared both by the decrees set forth at Ratisbone and Speirs, as hath beene declared.</P>
<P>The rest of the Pages of the Helvetians which were of a contrary profession, hearing of the end of this disputation at Berne (and namely because they had not regarded their ad|monition, disswading them to proceed in their intended purpose of disputation and reformation of Religion) confe|derated themselues in league with <HI>Ferdinandus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ferdinand</HI> and fiue Pages of the Helvetians enter league against the Bernates.</NOTE> to suppresse the Religion of Christ in Berne and Zurik.

And the Tigurines and Bernates begunne againe to stoppe the passages, so that for lacke of victuall the fiue Pages were pinched with penurie. Who notwithstan|ding arming themselues secretly, set forward in warre-like aray towardes the borders of Zurike, whereas then was ly|ing a Garrison of Zurike men, to the number of a thousand and aboue. Whereupon word was sent incontinent to the Cittie of Zurike for ayde to their men. But their enemies approached so fast, that they of Zurike could hardly come to rescue them; fot when they were come to the top of the hill, whereby they must needs passe, they did see their fel|lowes at the foote of the hill in great distresse. Whereupon they encouraging themselues, made downe the hill with more hast then order, striuing who should goe fastest, by reason whereof they were discomfited and ouer-matched by their enemies.

The Bernates were willing to come and reuenge their quarrell, but before they came, their enemies set vpon them the se|cond time, and had the vpper hand, yet would they of Zurik nothing relent in Religion.</P>
<P>At the last through mediation, a Peace was concluded, and thus the matter agreed, that the Tigurines, Bernates, and Basilians, should forsake the league which they lately made with the Citie of Strousbrough, and the Landgraue.

<P>In this Emperours time, amongst other places, great alte|ration of Religion fell out in the Countrey of England vp|on this occasion. <HI>Henry</HI> the 7. King of England, had two sonnes, <HI>Arthur</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI>; Prince <HI>Arthur</HI> his eldest sonne
<PB N="188" REF="103">
married <HI>Katherine,</HI> daughter to <HI>Ferdinand</HI> King of Spaine, but he soone after his marriage died without children. King <HI>Henry</HI> with advise of his Nobles to the end her dowrie might remaine within the Realme, thought meete to e|spouse Lady <HI>Katherine</HI> to Prince <HI>Henry,</HI> brother to King <HI>Arthur.</HI> This marriage seemed very strange and hard for one brother to marry the wife of another; but yet by dispen|sation of Pope <HI>Iulian</HI> the second, this marriage, which nei|ther sense of nature would admit, nor Gods law suffer, was concluded, approued, and ratified, and so continued as lawfull without any scruple or doubt the space of twentie yeares, till that a certaine doubt began to be moued by the Spaniards themselues of the Emperours Councell. Anno 1523. At which time <HI>Charles</HI> the Emperour being in Eng|land, promised to marry Lady <HI>Mary</HI> daughter to King <HI>Hen|ry</HI> the eyght, King of England, with the which promise the Spanyardes were not well contented; Obiecting, that the Ladie <HI>Mary</HI> was begotten of the King of England by his brothers wife. Whereupon, the Emperour forsaking the marriage, did couple himselfe with Ladie <HI>Isabell,</HI> daughter to King <HI>Emmanuel</HI> of Portugall, which marriage was done in the yeere of our Lord 1526. The King vpon this occasion casting many things in his minde, beganne to consider the matter more deeply, and finding that neither his conscience could be cleered in keeping his brothers wife, nor yet the estate of the Realme firme by the succession of a daughter begotten in such a marriage; he proposed the question to the chiefe Vniversities of all Christendome, whose censures all agreed in one, that the marriage was vnlawful. Yet would not the King proceed to the divorcement without the Popes consent. Who sent <HI>Campeius</HI> his Ambassadour with concurrance of the Cardinall of Yorke to be iudges in that cause. The Cardinall of Yorke, called <HI>Wolsey,</HI> at the first was verily bent to haue the divorceme~t set forward, but afterward finding that the Kings affection was bent towardes Ladie <HI>Anne Bulloigne,</HI> to take her in marriage, he changed his pur|pose, &amp; sent advertisment to Pope <HI>Clement,</HI> that in case King

<HI>Henry</HI> the eight were divorced from Ladie <HI>Katherine,</HI> then should another infected with <HI>Luthers</HI> doctrine succeede in her place, to the great hurt of the Church of Rome. For this cause the Pope calleth backe his Ambassadour <HI>Campe|ius,</HI> before the Kings cause was decided. Neuerthelesse, the King proceeded in his purpose, and was divorced from La|die <HI>Katherine</HI> by meanes of D^r <HI>Cranmer.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hatred be|twixt the Pope and King <HI>Henry</HI> the 8.</NOTE> This was the ground of that great hatred that fell out betweene the Pope and King <HI>Henry</HI>; for on the one part, the Pope cursed King <HI>Henry,</HI> and the Realme of England for the divorcement. The King on the other part abolished in his Realme the Bishop of Romes vnlawfull tyrannie, with commandement, that he should be called no more Pope in his Country, but onely Bishop of Rome, and that the King should be taken and re|puted as supreame head of the Church of England, &amp; haue full authoritie to reforme and redresse errours, heresies, and abuses in the same.</P>
<P>Now to returne againe to Germanie. The Emperour was so busied with Warres all this time, that he had no leisure to tarry in Germanie, and although many assemblies were ga|thered to suppresse the doctrine of <HI>Luther,</HI> he was onely present at two, to wit, at the first kept at Wormes, &amp; the last kept at Auspurg. For this cause it seemed good to the Em|perour, to declare his brother <HI>Ferdinand</HI> to be King of the Romanes, and apparent successor to the Empire, to the end he might with greater authoritie gouerne the affaires of the Empire in his absence. He sent also letters to the Protestants, commanding them to acknowledge him King. Wherefore the Ambassadours of the Protestant Cities being gathered at Franckford, concluded with the Princes, that for their part they would not for this resist the Emperour, &amp; for denying a title and a name only to his brother, to make him more ea|ger against their Religion. But the Duke of Saxonie, &amp; other Princes, not agreeing thereto, writ to the Emperour, that be|cause it was done against the manner and liberty of the Em|pire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Warres be|twixt <HI>Ferdi|nand</HI> and the Protestant Princes.</NOTE> they could not allow it. This seemeth to be the first ground of the warres that after followed. For <HI>Ferdinand</HI> King
<PB N="190" REF="104">
of the Romanes expelled <HI>Vlrich</HI> of Wirtenberge from his Lordship, and when no redresse could be had at the Empe|rours hands, the Landgraue of Hesse with his cousin <HI>Vlrich,</HI> gathered an Armie; at Lawferme by Wirtenberg ouercame their enemies, and put them to flight; recouered the townes of Asperge, Wrath, Tubinge, and Niphe, and tooke prisoner <HI>Philip,</HI> Prince Palatine and chiefe Captaine of <HI>Ferdinands</HI> ar|mie.</P>
<P>Shortly after, agreement was made on these conditions, that <HI>Vlrich</HI> should haue againe his Lordship of Wirtenberg,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Agreement made betwixt them.</NOTE> but so that he should hold it by the benefit of <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> and the house of Austrich; that if issue male did saile in the house of Wirtenberge, that Lordship should returne to the heire of the Emperours house of Austrich: that the Landgraue and <HI>Vlrich</HI> should come to <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> and submit themselues to him. The Emperour foreseeing that this diversitie of Reli|gion that was in Germanie, would in the end burst forth into some bitter fruit, and great inconuenience, aduised with himselfe by what means reconciliation might be made, and all controversie might cease: and in the end appointed a Councell at Wormes, and communication of Religion, and for this cause sent <HI>Granuellanus</HI> thither. But the matter was so long delayed by the fautors of the Sea of Rome, vn|till Letters came from the Emperour againe to deferre the whole matter to the Councell of Ratisbone. To which came all the Princes of the Empire, except the Duke of Saxonie, who came not himselfe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Councell held at Ratis|bone about the ending of controversies.</NOTE> but sent thither a noble ambassage, together with <HI>Melanchthon,</HI> and other Preachers. Vnto the same Councell also came from the Pope <HI>Caspar Conterane,</HI> a Cardinall. In this disputation, <HI>Fredericke</HI> the Palsgraue, and <HI>Granuellane</HI> were appointed moderators: <HI>Melanchthon, Bucer,</HI> and <HI>Pistorius,</HI> Disputers for the Protestants. <HI>Pflugius, Eccius,</HI> &amp; <HI>Gropper</HI> for the Papists. Vnto these six was offered a booke conteining the definition of most Articles in Controversie, which they were willed to ouer-looke, and either to allow or disallow those things that they could agree vpon. This booke was deliuered againe after a time to the Emperour; in
<PB N="191" REF="104">
many points they could not agree, in some they did. The Protestants deliuered together with the booke, their opini|on concerning those controversies, and their arguments to proue the same. The Emperour deliuered the same to the Princes to be examined: but they being most part Popish, referred the whole matter to the Popes Ambassadour, who exhorting the Bishops to honestie of life, and suppressing of <HI>Luthers</HI> doctrine, thought good it should be deferred to a generall Councell. This convention which began in Aprill Anno 1541. was dissolued in the end of Iulie; after that the Emperour had decreed, that the communication begun, and whole controversie of Religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The conclusi|on of the Councell.</NOTE> should be deferred to a ge|nerall or Provinciall Councell of Germanie: That the Pro|testants should teach no other points of Religion, then such as were agreed vpon: That Bishops should see amendment of life in their Diocesse: That there should be a Provinciall Councell within a yeare and an halfe, if they could not ob|taine a generall Councell of the Pope: That the Churches of Monasteries should not be pulled downe, but reformed: that the Church-goods should not be inverted: that the decree of Ausbrough, and all Proscriptions of the Protestants should be suspended: all those conventions of estates, dis|putations, promises of generall or provinciall Councels to be kept in Germanie, could not reconcile diuerse Religions, but at length lurking hatred behoued to breake out into o|pen hostilitie.</P>
<P>The first occasion whereof was offered by <HI>Henry,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Warres be|twixt <HI>Henry</HI> Prince of Brunswick, &amp; the Duke of Saxonie in name of all the Prote|stants, where|in <HI>Henries</HI> do|minions were subdued.</NOTE> Prince of Brunswick, who by often invasion of Cities, confederated with the Protestants in Germany, moued the Duke of Saxo|nie and the Landgraue, to make warre against him in name &amp; quarrell of all the Protestants, confederated by the league of Smalcaldy. In this warre they subdued all his dominions, and compelled him with his eldest sonne <HI>Charles</HI> to flie for their safetie into Bavarie. <HI>Henry</HI> to recouer his dominions againe, first pursued the Protestants in the Chamber-court of the Empire, but the Protestants appealed and refused the iudgement thereof.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="105">Next he made his complaint to <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> the Emperours brother; and last went into Italie to the Emperour, &amp; there at Cremona grieuously accused the Protestants, to whom the Emperour sent an hard message, that if the Prince of Bruns|wick were not restored, he would take such order, whereby he should be restored whether they would or no. Notwith|standing all this, the Emperour at his returning into Ger|manie, after he had heard the declaration of the Protestants against the Duke of Brunswick, albeit, the Emperour was loath to giue out any grieuous sentence against him, yet at length he determined that all the Dukes lands should re|maine as sequestred in his hands, vntill that matter were en|ded.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A peace con|cluded betwixt the Emperour and the King of France, wherein was determined that both should ioyne against the Protestants.</NOTE>All this while the Emperour was busied in warres against the King of France; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut in the end a peace was concluded be|tweene them vpon certaine conditions.

There were slaine, partly in that towne, partly abroad, aboue 800. beside other places. They which fled vnto the mountaines &amp; woods, partly were famished, partly otherwise slaine, partly sent to the Gallowes. 25 persons that fled into a caue by the towne of Mussie, were smoothered to death with smoke.</P>

<P>In Germanie like as it was harder to oppresse so great a number as had alreadie embraced the Gospell, so likewise the Emperour was compelled to doe his turne by craft, ra|ther then by force, for he sent letters to diuers cities of the Protestants as to Argentine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Empe|rour vseth po|licie to sub|due the Prote|stants.</NOTE> Noriberg, Ausbrough, Vlmes, indeuouring to perswade them, that he entended not warre against them, but against certaine other traytours and re|bells, against whom hee doubted not but they would as|sist him.

Also when <HI>Palsgraue</HI> of Rhene writ to the Emperour to know against whom he prepared his war, he receiued the same answere that before was written to the cities with mani|fest signification that it was against certaine Princes of the Protestants, not so much for religion as for other things: and finallie the Heluetians who had receiued the Gospell, <HI>Tigure, Berne</HI> and <HI>Basile</HI> were circumuented with the like po|licie: for the Emperour had perswaded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hem that he would not medle with religion: by this meanes hee had not onely diuers places quiet, but also vsed the helpe of many Princes and cities which fauoured the religion against the Duke of Saxonie and Lantgraue of Hesse.

Wherefore the Duke made speed to Witemberg and burnt the bridge that the Emperour should haue no readie passage to pursue him, but the Emperour getting knowledge of a shallow ford in the riuer quicklie followed the Duke, and by the wood of Lothans ouertooke him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Empe|rour discom|fiteth the D. of Saxonie &amp; taketh him prisoner, and giueth all his his lands to <HI>Maurice.</HI></NOTE> &amp; ioyning battell discomfited him and tooke him prisoner, and although the Duke was con|demned to die, yet by the entreatie of the Marques of Bran|denburg his life was granted him with most grieuous condi|tions, amongst which this was one, that hee should submit himselfe to the old religion, but he chosed rather to die then so to doe. Wherefore the Marques of Brandenburg obtained also that condition to be remitted: but al his lands and goods were giuen to <HI>Maurice,</HI> except a pension of 50000. crownes

which the same <HI>Maurice</HI> paied him yeerely. Immediately herevpon Witemberg yeelded to the Emp. as also diuers o|ther Princes and Cities did the like. The Lantgraue was con|tent to yeeld al that he had to the Emp. pleasure so that hee might not be kept prisoner, which condition the Marques of Brandenburg &amp; <HI>Maurice</HI> the new Duke of Saxonie, that had married his daughter, vndertooke to obtaine, and for the per|formance of the same bound the~selues to him in great bonds But when he came to the Emp. hee was commaunded to re|maine as prisoner:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lant|graue detained prisoner by the Emperour.</NOTE> then he began to complaine grieuously say|ing that the Emperour kept not promise.

For his meaning was onely to pardon him perpetuall emprisonment. This matter after|ward turned the Emp. to great trouble. In the meane time hauing the principall chiefe Princes of the Protestants in Captiuitie, the Emp. thought meete to gather a conuention of the estates at Ausbrough to finish that matter which hee had intended long before.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A convention at Ausbrough.</NOTE> All the Electors with other Prin|ces were gathered together in great number, but about the citie and in diuers places of the countrie, neere thereto was companies of Spaniards and Italians, and other soul|diers to the terrour of them that were present.

<P>The Emperour required of the Princes, priuatlie of the <HI>Palsgraue</HI> &amp; <HI>Maurice</HI> Duke of Saxonie, whether they would submit themselues to the Councell of Trident or no. At the first they refused it, but afterward fearing the Emp. displea|sure they were co~tented to permit the matter to his will. The free cities also being demaunded if they would adde any thing to the answere of the Princes, answered it was not their part so to doe, and offered a writing to the Emperour, on what condition they would admit the Councell.</P>
<P>The Emperour as though they had fullie consented sent
<PB N="197" REF="107">
to the Cardinall of Trident and the Pope desiring that the Councell which was remoued from Trident to Bononia, might bee againe revoked to Trident which was nee|rer to Germanie, vpon hope that the Germanes would come and submit themselues to the Councell. But for|asmuch as the Pope and Bishops assembled at Bononie, would not returne backe againe to Trident, but vpon such conditions as liked themselues best: the Emperour pro|tested by his Ambassadours that all such things that they should decree there to be vnlawfull and of no force, and that he himselfe would vndertake the care of the co~mon-wealth of Christendome which the Bishops neglected. Thus the Emperour perceiuing that there was no hope of a generall councell in Germanie consulted with the Princes about the agreement of Religion, and appointed <HI>Iulius Pflugins</HI> Bi|shop of Numburg, <HI>Michael Sidon</HI> and <HI>Iohn Islebie</HI> to draw out a booke for reformation of Religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The booke called <HI>Interim</HI> vrged by the Emperour.</NOTE> which they called In|terim. This was the ground of a new trouble, for the Emperour strictly commaunded that the Princes would receiue and admit the manner of Religion set forth in the booke called Interim. The Duke of Saxonie that was kept prisoner, being earnestlie required to subscribe would not in any wise, and for that cause after was vsed more strictly, insomuch that his Preacher who was hitherto permitted, fled for feare of danger.</P>
<P>The Lantgraue hoping to obtaine fauour, and libertie receiued the Emperours booke, and submitted himselfe to it, but all would not helpe him. The Marques of Bran|denburge not onely receiued it himselfe, but also sent for <HI>Martin Bucer,</HI> whom partly with entreatie, partly with thret|nings he commaunded to subscribe the Emperours booke, but he constantlie refused, and with great danger of his life returned to Argentine.</P>

<P><HI>Mauricius</HI> Duke of Saxonie returning home from Ausbrough, Proclaimed the Emperours decree concerning Religion. Vpon that occasion the diuines and Preachers, of the vniuersities of Lipsia and Witenberg, diuers times assembled themselues, and at length concluded vpon these things (that they called indifferent) to receiue them as the Emperour had prescribed. This thing was by other Prea|chers in Germanie sore impugned, saying that by the inter|pretation of their indifferencie they had opened a way to the whole doctrine, and superstition of the Church of Rome taking those things for indifferent in which was manifest errour.</P>

Af|ter this <HI>Solyman</HI> slew <HI>Lewis</HI> King of Hungarie, and <HI>Paulus</HI> Bishop of Collen, who more rashly then wisely, with a small power of foure and twenty thousand men, encountered the great Turke leading an army of 200000. souldiers. Also hee besieged Vienna, but was mightily resisted and repulsed with losse of a great number of his army: all this was done before the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> began to stirre himselfe a|gainst the Turke: but when the matters of religion in Ger|manie were put to some point in the Councell of Ratisbon, the Emperour raised an army of eighty thousand footmen, and thirty thousand horsemen: and compelled the Turke to raise his siege from the towne of Gunza, and with speed to retyre backe to Constantinople.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Charles</HI> resto|reth the K. of Tunis to his kingdome.</NOTE></P>

Which done, hee prevailed mightily in Hungarie, and tooke the towne called Quinque ecclesiae, and Strigonium, Alba re|galis, and Vizigradum: and it was an easie matter for him to haue conquered all Hungarie, in respect the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> was so busie in warres with the King of France, that the common enemy of all Christian people had leave to rage at his owne pleasure, and had it not beene the graci|ous providence of God, pitying the misery of Christian people, who stirred vp the Persian Sophie against <HI>Solyman,</HI> and droue him backe out of Europe for a time, and like|wise the murther of his owne sonne <HI>Mustapha,</HI> which stir|red vp a peece of a Tragedie in his owne house, the Chri|stian people had no doubt beene brought to greater extre|mities in <HI>Solymans</HI> dayes.

<P>AFter that <HI>Charles</HI> the fift had surrendered the Imperi|all crowne into the hands of the Electors of Germany, they assembled at Frankford, and there elected <HI>Ferdinand</HI> King of Bohemia, and brother to the forenamed <HI>Charles</HI> the fift to bee Emperour, who raigned seven yeeres. The ancient manner was that he should be crowned in the fore|noone at masse: but because diverse of the Electors would not in any wise come to masse, the coronation was solem|nized in the afternoone, and the masse with other like cere|monies omitted.</P>
<P>To this King before hee was elected Emperour, his No|bles in the countrey of Bohemia made earnest supplication that they might bee permitted to vse the Sacrament in both kindes, according to Christs institution: but he strict|ly commanded them they attempted no alteration in religi|on.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bohemi|ans obtaine of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the vse of the Sa|crament in both kinds.

<P>The Guisians purposing to supresse the Scotish Nobility, sent out of France into Scotland an army of 4000 men, vn|der the conduct of Monsieur <HI>La Broch.</HI> This army assi|sted the Queene regent to reduce backe againe the king|dome of Scotland to the Romish religion: But the Scottish Nobility obtayned helpe of the Queene of Eng|land, and brought the Frenchmen to such extremity, that they were compelled to accept conditions of peace, and to retyre backe againe to France.

After whose death the innocency of the Prince of Condie, was declared by a decree of the Par|liament at Paris: and the government of the young King, <HI>Charles</HI> the ninth, was devolued in the hands of the Queen mother, and the King of Navarre. Those Gouernours with advice of the States of the Realme,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A disputation at Poyssie.</NOTE> thought meet that a free disputation should be appointed at Poyssie a towne in France, neere to Saint Germane, wherein the controversies of religion should bee freely reasoned, in presence of the young King, the Queene mother, the King of Navarre, and other Princes of the royall blood.</P>
<P>This disputation began the ninth of September, <HI>anno</HI> 1561. For the Protestants part were appointed <HI>Theodorus Beza</HI> Minister at Geneva, <HI>Peter Martyr</HI> professor of Divi|nity in Zuricke, <HI>Nicholas Gelasius, Augustinus Marloratus, Iohannes Merlinus, Franciscus Morellus, Iohannes Malo,</HI> and <HI>Espineus,</HI> a man of great learning, who had lately forsaken the Romane Church, and embraced the true reformed religion. On the other part the Cardinall of Loraine, with many o|ther Cardinalls, Archbishops, and Bishops, to the number of fifty Prelates, besides many other Divines and Doctors were ready to pleade the cause of the Romish Church. In this disputation, after that <HI>Theodorus Beza</HI> had at length declared the summe of the Protestants faith, and the Car|dinall of Loraine had answered: In the end the Romane Prelats devised a pretty shift to cut off all further reasoning:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Papists policy to cut off further reasoning.</NOTE> for the Cardinall of Loraine produced the opinion of the Germans about the matter of the Sacrament, extracted out of the co~fession of Ausbrugh, &amp; Jemanded of the Protestants whether they would subscribe to it or no, to the end that if they consented to subscribe, they might seem to haue con|victed themselues of errour in the matter of the Sacrament;
<PB N="207" REF="112">
and if they refused to subscribe, then it might bee knowne to the Princes that were present, that the Protestants agreed not amongst themselues.</P>
<P>To this it was answered by <HI>Theodorus Beza</HI> in the next meeting, that if the confession of Ausbrough should be sub|scribed, then it was good reason to require a subscription of the whole confession, and not of one line thereof onely: also if they vrged the Protestants to subscribe that confession of Ausbrough, then let themselues first begin to subscribe the same: and when they haue yeelded to the whole con|fession of Ausbrugh, it will be more easie to finde out any way of agreement in matters of religion. After this the forme of disputation was changed, and a few in number, to wit, fiue onely on either side, were chosen to conferre in quiet and peaceable manner, who beginning at the matter of the Sacrament, seemed all to agree in this forme: that Ie|sus Christ by the operation of the holy Spirit, offereth and exhibiteth vnto vs the very substance of his body &amp; blood, and wee doe receiue and eate spiritually and by faith that same body which dyed for vs, to the end we may be flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bones, and that we may be quick|ned by him, and receiue all things that are needfull to our salvation. And because faith leaning to the word of God maketh those things that are received to be present, by this faith indeed we receiue truely and effectually the very natu|rall body and blood of Iesus Christ, through the power of the holy Spirit. In this respect wee acknowledge the pre|sence of the body and blood in the Supper. The article of the Sacrament being conceiued in this forme, was presented to both the parties, and many of the Romane Prelates con|discended to the article aboue specified: but when they had conferred with the Doctors of Sorbon, they all with one consent refused the same: and finding that the com|muners that were chosen for their part did persevere in their opinion, they cryed out against them, and would giue no further power to them to reason in that cause. Thus the dis|putation of Poyssie broke vp the 25. of November, without
<PB N="208" REF="113">
any agreement of the controversies in religion, but rather leaving in the harts of men a seed of greater contention and cruell wars, which afterward ensued. But before we speak of the warres in France for religion: somewhat is to bee spo|ken of the cruell persecution that the faithfull suffered in Pi|emont, in which countrey certaine townes had received the Gospell, and abolished the masse: namely, the townes of Angrona, Lucerne, Perose, Tallaret, with divers others in the convalles of Piemont: all which townes are subiect to the dominion of the Duke of Savoy, who hearing of the reformation that was made in the foresayd bounds of his dominion, sent out his Captaine <HI>Triniteus</HI> with an army of 500.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of Savoy warreth against the Protestants within his do|minions.</NOTE> men, against them, to sack and vtterly destroy them, ex|cept they would receiue the masse againe, and put away from them their ministers. The towne of Angrona was first assaul|ted, and the people fled to the mountaines, but being strict|ly pursued they turned themselues, and with slings &amp; stones defended their liues and put their enemies to the worse, in so much that <HI>Triniteus</HI> the Dukes Captaine was to deale with them by subtilty and craft,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Triniteus</HI> by policy spoileth those of An|grona both their money and armour.</NOTE> rather then by open force, and therefore promised vnto the Convallenses that if they layd downe their armour, and sent messengers to the Duke to cuane his pardon, and would pay to him the summe of sixteene thousand crownes, then vpon those conditions they should haue peace.</P>
<P>The poore people glad to accept conditions of peace, performed all that was required, but no peace could be ob|tained of the Duke, except they would put away their Mi|nisters, and receiue the masse againe. Therefore being spoi|led both of money and armour, by the craft of their ene|mies, and a new army also sent against them, they were compelled in time of winter to flie with their wiues and children to the mountaines all over-layd and covered with snow&punc; and from thence to behold the pitifull specta|cles of the burning of their houses, and spoyling of their goods.

<P>Afeer this, the Prince of Condie perceiuing that great preparation was made against him, and the Queene mo|thers affection was turned away to the Guisians, thought meete to send for ayde to the Queene of England; and the Prince of Condie willing to ioyne himselfe with the English armie, marched forward to Normandie, but the Duke of Guise followed after him with so great celeritie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The battell of Dreux, where|in the Prince of Condie was taken by the Papists, and the Constable by the Prote|stants.</NOTE> that the Prince of Condie was compelled to ioyne Battell with the Guisians at Dreux in Normandie, before he was supported of the English armie.</P>

In the low countries, the number of them that professed the Gospell increased marueilously; and on the other part, the rage of the Popish Prelats causing the Spanish Inquisition to be severely executed, wrought great feare in the hearts of the professours of the Gospell.</P>
<P>Also Duke <HI>de Albe</HI> was sent with a great Armie vnto the low Countries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Duke <HI>de Al|baes</HI> crueltie against the professours of the Gospell.</NOTE> vtterly to extirpate and roote out the Gos|pell, who behaued himselfe most outragiously against the Nobilitie and Townes of the low Countries, in beheading Count <HI>Egmount,</HI> and count <HI>Horne,</HI> and permitting his soul|diers to vse all kinde of villanie against honest matrons, and the daughters of honest Citizens, and oftentimes compelled the husbands themselues to stand beside, and be eye witnes|ses of the vilde abusing of their owne wiues. Also with so great severity he executed the Spanish Inquisitio~ against the professours of the Gospell, that the people were compelled to take armes, vnder the conduct of <HI>William Nassaw,</HI> Prince of Orange, and <HI>Lodouicus</HI> his brother, to defend their liues, the libertie of their Countrie, and of their Consciences a|gainst the barbarous tyrannie of this Duke and his armie.</P>
<P>In this Warre although the Prince of Orange was often|times defeated, and his brother slaine, yet the Countrey so abhorred the crueltie of Duke <HI>de Albe,</HI> that the most part of Zeland and Holland was conquered by the Princes ar|mie, and was free from the tyrannie of the Spaniards.</P>
<P>In France the professours of the Gospell could not enioy the benefit of the Edict of pacification made in March,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince of Orange war|reth against the Spaniards.</NOTE> An|no 1563. except in a few parts where the authoritie of some noble persons fauouring the Gospell procured obedience to the foresaid Edict, as namely, the presence of Condie in Picardie, <HI>Andelot</HI> in Britannie, and the Queene of Navarre in Gascoigne. In other parts of the country, little regard was had to the Edict. The Cardinall of Loraine also a capitall enemie to the Gospell, had consulted with the fathers of the
<PB N="214" REF="116">
Councell of Trent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cardinal of Loraine taketh coun|sell how to suppresse the Gospell.</NOTE> by what way the Gospell might be sup|pressed in France, and it was thought meetest that a coue|nant should be made amongst them that fauoured the Catho|lique Religion (which they called the holy league) to ex|tirpate and roote out them that professed the new Religion (for so they named it) and the two puissant Kings of Spaine and France in speciall should bee intreated to be of this league, and mutually to helpe one another to roote out the Gospellers. Now when King <HI>Charles</HI> the 9. was 14. yeares old, and declared to be Maior, it was thought meete that he should make a progresse through the bounds of his Domi|nions; pretending that it was expedient that the King should know the estate of his Country, and that he should heare the complaints of his people; but the cause indeed of this pro|gresse, was that the King of France might meete with the King of Spain in Bayon, for binding vp of the league afore|said. In this progresse was discharged all Preaching and ex|ercising of the reformed Religion in the Townes of France, wherein it should happen the King to be, during the time of his progresse. Also many new interpretations of the edict of March were invented and found out, whereby the libertie granted to the Protestants was vtterly infringed and impuni|tie granted to them that should doe them wrong. In the end the King came to Bayon, where he met with his sister <HI>Eli|zabeth,</HI> wife to <HI>Philip</HI> King of Spaine, who after she had de|clared certaine causes why her husband could not be present himselfe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A league made betwixt the Kings of France and Spaine, for the rooting out of the Prote|stants.</NOTE> bound vp in name of her husband a couenant with <HI>Charles,</HI> King of Spaine, mutually to helpe one another in rooting out the professours of the reformed Religion. The report of this league was not kept so secret but it came to the eares of the Prince of Condie, and the rest of the nobilitie of France, that professed the Gospell, who all thought meete that the Prince of Condie should in proper person addresse himselfe to the King (being for the time at Moncellium) and should exhibite to the King the supplication of the Protestants in France, pittifully complaining, that contrarie to the edict of March they were iniuried and cruelly slaine,
<PB N="215" REF="116">
desiring redresse of the aforesaid iniuries, and that they might haue libertie to enioy their Religion according to the act of pacification aboue mentioned. But the King hearing of the Prince of Condies comming to him, and (namely because he was well accompanied with foure hundred men all in armes) fearing the malignitie and obstinate malice of his adversaries, left they should hinder his iourney or doe wrong to himselfe. The King (I say) hearing tell of the Princes comming, made hast to depart, and with all expedi|tion, to Paris in great feare, and caused the Parisians to giue thankes to God, as though he had beene deliuered from a great perill and imminent danger.</P>
<P>After this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The second ciuill warre in France.</NOTE> without further delay, the second warre for Religion in France broke vp. The Prince of Condie ap|proached with an armie to Paris, and so beset it about in all quarters, that this populous Towne soone began to be grieued for want of foode, and issued out of the Towne vn|der the Conduct of the Constable, and came by S. Denis, where the Prince of Condies armie lay. In this Battell the Admirall set vpon the Parisian souldiers, and disturbed their rankes and put them to flight. The Constables troope also was greatly perturbed by their flying, and the Con|stable himselfe refusing to be taken by M. <HI>Stewart,</HI> was shot by a Scottish Souldier, whereof hee soone after died.</P>
<P>The Constables sonnes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parisians ouercome by the Prince of Condie.</NOTE> <HI>Anveil</HI> and <HI>Momerance,</HI> being carefull for their Father, succoured him, and the battell was renewed againe, and cruelly fought, vntill night compel|led them to make an end. The morrow after, the Prince of Condie came with his Forces againe to the place where the battell was fought, but none of the Parisians came forth to encounter him.</P>
<P>After the battell he marched toward Loraine, of purpose to ioyne with the Germane Armie, which was to be sent for his support from the Count Palatine of the Rhine, vn|der the conduct of <HI>Cassimire,</HI> his owne sonne. This armie of the Germanes ioyned with the Forces of the Prince of Condie at Pontamonssou, a towne in Loraine on the riuer

<P>This towne the Prince of Condie and the Germanes be|sieged, and when it was fore battered, and not able to in|dure the siege any longer, the Queene mother according to her wonted manner, thought meete to compasse them with faire and deceitfull promises, whom she could not get ouerthrowne by force. And therefore sent to the Prince of Condie, desiring him to require of the King conditions of peace, such as himselfe liked best, and they should be granted.</P>

All this was granted, and the edict of pacifica|tion was proclaimed. The townes also which the Prote|stants had conquered with great paines and effusion of their blood, were all deliuered into the hands of their enemies, the Germane souldiers were dismissed, and euery man re|turned to his owne house. But in the very time of their re|turning, it was knowne that this pacification was but a sub|tile snare to entangle them withall; for the professours of the Gospell were compelled to lay downe their armour when they entred into the townes where they dwelt, and strictly commanded to remaine in their houses, so that they had not libertie to visite one another.</P>

<P>On the other side, the Duke <HI>de Anion</HI> was come with his armie to Poictou, and pitched his Campe at Castellerault, a Towne of Poictou neere to the river Vienna.

<P>In the meane time, both parties waited for supplyment of new Forces out of Germanie, and Duke <HI>de Aumald</HI> was sent to Loraine to meete the Dukes who came to support the Kings armie; as also to hinder the progresse of the Duke of Bipont, who was marching forward to support the Prince of Condies armie.</P>

<P>The number of those that were slaine at this battell, are supposed by some to haue beene sixe or seauen thousand men; by others, twise as many.

<P>The Princes with the Admirall consulted in what part of the Realme it were meetest to sustaine the hazzard of the Warrefare;<NOTE PLACE="marg">By a new edict of pacification the third ciuill warre endeth.</NOTE> and it was thought meetest in Languedok, be|cause the Towne of Nimes was lately surprised by the Protestants, and many townes in that Countrie fauoured their Religion.</P>
<P>While new preparations are made by the Princes to su|staine the Warre, behold, a new edict of pacification is for forth, granting libertie of Religion to the Protestants a|gaine, and granting to them for their further securitie, the keeping of foure Townes during the space of two yeares, to wit, Rotchell, Cognack, Montallan, and Caritea. This edict being proclaimed in both th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Campes, the people were in great ioy, being wearied with long and perillou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

Warres, and being desirous to visite their owne houses and families. Thus was an end put to the third ciuill warre in France.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King marrieth.</NOTE>After this pacification, the King married <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> daughter to <HI>Maximilian</HI> the Emperour: and the rumour went thorow the Countrey, that the King was inclined to peace. Likewise the apparent hatred betwixt the King and the Duke of Aniou his brother confirmed this rumour: for it seemed to the people, that the King was offended, be|cause the Prelates of France depended more vpon his bro|ther then vpon himselfe, and paied to him yeerely 200000 Frankes, to be a patron and defender of their cause. Where|fore it seemed to many that the King would incline his af|fection toward the Protestants, to abandon the power of his brother. But all this was deceitfull treacherie, to colour the intended malice of his heart.</P>
<P>Also the edict of pacification was better kept then it had beene at any other time before, except in a few places. And when the Queene of Navarre sent messengers to the King, to complaine of the violation of the edict in the Townes of Roane and Aurenge: the King returned backe againe to her a very pleasant answere, that he would not onely punish most seuerely the transgressours of the edict,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of|fereth his sister in marriage to the King of Navarre, that thereby he might insnare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Prote|stants.</NOTE> but also for a further confirmation of a stedfast bond of Peace with the Protestants, he would bestow <HI>Mar|garet</HI> his sister in marriage to the King of Navarre her sonne.</P>
<P>The King himselfe passed to Bloyes, and sent for the Queene of Navarre, whom hee receiued so courteously, and conferred with so louingly, that the Queene was fully perswaded, that this marriage would be a sure pledge and bond of constant peace.</P>
<P>The Admirall also was sent for, and met the King at Bloyes, whom the King seemed to reuerence and honour out of measure; in so much that the Admiralls heart was betwitched with the Kings faire speeches, supposing that he meant vprightly, to bind vp indeed a bond of con|stant
<PB N="223" REF="120">
Peace with the Protestants. Specially for this, that the King seemed to prepare an armie for support of the Prince of Orange, and the Admirall was appointed to be generall Commander of the armie.</P>
<P>The time of the celebration of the marriage drawing neere (which was appointed to be solemnized in Paris by the Cardinall of Burbone) the Queene of Navarre ad|dressed her selfe toward Paris,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queene of Navarre being empoy|soned, dieth.</NOTE> to make preparation for the marriage, and the Admirall with many earnest requests of the King was sollicited to bee present at the marri|age; As also all the principall Noble-men of the Prote|stants.</P>
<P>The forerunners of the lamentable Tragedie that after followed began soone to appeare, if the hearts of men had not beene setled in a deepe securitie. For the Queene of Navarre, as she was busied in making preparation for the marriage, died hastily being cut off by empoysoned Gloues, which shee receiued from an Italian the Kings Vnguentarie.</P>
<P>But the King seemed to be in such heauinesse for her death, and the matter was so finely conveyed, that all suspition was incontinently quenched and buried,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of Navarre mar|ried to the Kings sister.</NOTE> and the marriage was celebrated the eight-teenth day of August Anno 1572. Soone after, to wit, the twentie two day of August appeared a cleere presage of the future Tragedie: for the Admirall as he went from the Loover to his house was shot with two or three Bullets in the arme.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Admirall shot in the arme.</NOTE> This was taken in very euill part by the King of Navarre and Prince of Condie: who desired libertie to depart from Paris, wherein they saw so euident danger to themselues and their friends. But the King with so many attestations, protested the miscontentment of his owne minde in that matter: and that he would diligently search and seuerely punish the au|thors of that deed, that in some part he quieted the hearts of the complainers.</P>
<P>Likewise, the King himselfe came to visit the Admirall, with pittifull words, lamenting the chance that was fallen out,
<PB N="224" REF="121">
and affirming the dishonour to be done to him, although the Admirall had receiued the hurt. Also he desired that the Admirall would be content to be transported to the Loouer of Paris for his better securitie, in case any popular commotion should fall out, vntill he should be trying and punishing the authors of that fact. And when the King perceiued that the Admirall made excuse of his infirmitie, that he could not suffer to be transported, the King appoin|ted some of his owne Guard to attend vpon the Admiral<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> house,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Admirall attended vpon by the Kings Guard.</NOTE> and the Protestants were commanded to prepare their lodgings neere to the Admirals house, to be a guard vnto him, in case any commotion should happen in the Towne.</P>
<P>All this was done vnder deepe dissimulation, to put the Protestants in securitie, that they should not once imagine of the Tragedie that was to come. And the Admirall sent his Letters to all parts of the Countrey where the Prote|stants were, that they should make no stirre for that which was done vnto him, for the wound was not deadly, and God and the King would see the authors thereof punished. The night after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Massacre of Paris the 24. of August Anno 1572.</NOTE> was the appointed time for the horrible Massacre of the Protestants that were in Paris. The Duke of Aniou and the Duke of Guise having their souldiers ready armed in the streets, were waiting for the signe that was to be giuen to beginne their bloudie Enterprise: which being once giuen out of the Church of S. Ger|mane, the Duke of Guise set first vpon the Admirals house; Those of the Kings guard (of whom we spoke be|fore) that were appointed for defending of the Admirall now euidently declared the true cause wherefore they were placed in that roome;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Admirall killed.</NOTE> for they rushed in violently, and killed the Admirall, and threw him downe out of a window into the close, where the Duke of Guise was awai|ting for that spectacle, and for ioy would scarcely beleeue that it was he, vntill he had wiped the blood from his face.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="121">Then he encouraged all his companie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of Guise encou|rageth the companie to murther the Protestants.</NOTE> and sayd. This is a good beginning, goe to, goe to: it is the kings will, it is the kings commaundement. What bloodie crueltie fol|lowed, without all commiseration, slaying men, women and children, no tongue is able to expresse, the sounding of bells, the shouting of the pursuers, and the pitifull cries of the slaine, all concurring together made the spectacle of that day to be verie terrible. Also the Duke of Guise with Mompensier and many others passed thorow the streets, en|couraging the people and augmenting their furie and mad|nesse, saving that the wicked seede of the Protestants should be vtterlie rooted out.</P>
<P>The like outragious crueltie was also practised in the Lower where the king was.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The compa|nies which at|tended the king of Na|varre and Prince of Condie, slaine</NOTE> For the whole companie that were attending vpon the king of Navarre and Prince of Condie were commaunded to lay downe their armour, and goe without the Palace, where they were most cruellie slaine by armed Souldiers attending on their out|comming. The king of Navarre and Prince of Condie themselues were brought before the king and threatned that except they would renounce that religion which they professed, they should surely die.</P>
<P>The king of Navarre humbly requested the king to re|gard that new bond of friendship that was bound vp be|tweene them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The king v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|geth the Prince of Condie and king of Na|uarre to be come Papists.

<P>The Prince of Condie added moreouer that his life was in the kings hands, to dispose of it as it plea|sed him but as for his Religion hee had receiued the knowledge of it from God, to whom also hee behoued to render account of the same, and hee would not renounce it for any feare or danger of this present life.</P>
<P>Some of the Protestants then lodged in the Fobers of S. Germane, as Count <HI>Mongomrie</HI> &amp; diuers others, for intercep|ting of whom the king had giuen commandement to the
<PB N="226" REF="122">

<P>This matter being signified to the Duke of Guise, hee tooke with him a Companie of armed men to inter|cept in time,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Mongomrie</HI> and his complices.

<P>But when they saw the Heluetian souldiers making hast by boates and shippes to crosse the water, and to come ouer to the Fobers of S. Germane to cut them off, they made hast and fled. The Duke of Guise with Duke <HI>De Aumald</HI> and the Count of Angolesme pursued them to Montfort which is eight leagues distant from Paris, but could not ouertake them and so returned backe againe to Paris. In this Massacre were slaine many noble men such as the Admirall, <HI>Telignius, Rupefocald, Renelius,</HI> and many learned men, amongst whom were <HI>Petrus Ramus</HI> and <HI>Lambinus</HI>: and of others moe than 10000. persons whose bodyes were layed on heapes vpon cartes, and cast into the riuer of Seane which was coulered red with the blood of the slaine.

<P><PB N="227" REF="122">Likewise in many other townes the rage of the like cruel|tie was felt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In this Massa|cre were killed 30000 per|sons in France</NOTE> so that within the space of a moneth moe then 30000. persons were reckoned to be slaine.

After this pitifull disaster it seemed that the religion in France was vtterlie quenched, for the noble men were slaine, some had made defection, and o|thers for feare had left the land. Only a few towns were in the Protestants hands such as Rochell, Montalban, Nines, Sauserr and some others of small account.

In conclusion the army approached dayly neerer and neerer to Paris, yet no battell was fought, because the Queene mother listened more to the instruc|tions shee had given to <HI>Alauscon</HI> her sonne, then to the doubtfull successe of battell, and force of armed men, and indeed a more sure way to obtaine their purpose. For messengers being sent to the King to treate for peace, the Queene mother perceived that all other conditions how ample soever they had beene, might bee easily eluded and broken, but if the townes of Metis, Tullion, and Ver|dum, were in the hands of a potent stranger, it would be a great abandoning of the Kings power in all time to come. Therefore the matter was so brought about, that <HI>Cassimire</HI> was content to receiue from the King a great summe of money, in stead of those townes which should haue beene put in his hands, and libertie was granted to the Protestants to exercise their owne religion openly and freely, without exception of places, the Court and the towne of Paris, with a few leagues about, one|ly excepted. Also they were declared to bee capable of places in Parliament, and places of Iustice Courts: all iudgements which were made against them for any enter|prise whatsoever was declared voyd: The cruell day of Sant <HI>Bartholomew</HI> disavowed, and for better assurance and performance of the conditions, they had eight townes de|livered vnto them, with the conditions of their govern|ments, Aques Mortes, Bencaire, Perigneux, Le mas de ver|dun,

<P>AFter the death of <HI>Maximilian, Rodulphus</HI> his sonne was made Emperour. In his time the warres in France, which seemed to be well quieted by the last edict of pacification, began to kindle vp againe with greater flame. For the adversaries of religion besought the Kings Maiestie to restraine the pernitious liberty of the edict of peace: but perceiving him not to bee sufficiently moved to breake the peace, and to take knife in hand, they began to assemble at Perone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The league of Peron 1576. for the extirpa|tion of the Protestants.</NOTE> <HI>Anno</HI> 1576. and to binde vp a league amongst themselues for the extirpation of the Protestants, and for the revocation of the edict of peace, wherein they swore obedience and service to the Generall tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hould bee appointed over this fellowship, ingaging their liues and honours, never to seperate themselues for any commande|ment, pretence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The causes moving the Leaguers to proceed in their associa|tion.</NOTE> excuse, or occasion whatsoever. There were two things that greatly animated the Leaguers to pro|ceed in their association, to wit: First, that the Protestants yeelded not vp the townes which they had gotten for their assurance, for the space of sixe yeeres. The sixe yeeres be|ing ended, they complained to the King that conditi|ons were not kept vnto them, and that for the abolishing of warres, and setling of peace in France, it was needfull that they should haue those townes a longer time in their main|tenance, whereto the King condiscended.</P>
<P>This grieved the Leaguers: but another thing grieved them more, that <HI>Alauscon</HI> the Kings brother for griefe of the hard successe of his affaires in the Low Countries, died at Chasteau Thierry. And the King himselfe having no children, the feare that they conceived of the King of Na|varres succession to the Kingdome, caused the Leaguers rage. While the flame issued out of this furnace, the King of France easily perceived that the drift of all the Leaguers
<PB N="236" REF="127">
enterprises was against his life and crowne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The drift of the Leaguers enterprise a|gainst the K. and crowne.</NOTE> and to set vp a|nother whom it pleased them in his place. For the Lea|guers pretended warre against the Hugonots, and yet they seazed vpon the best townes of the Catholikes, in all the Realme. The religion was preached in Guyen, and they went to driue it out of Picardie. The Hugonotes were in Rochell, and the Leaguers army marched straight to Paris. They are at Montpelliere, and the league set vpon Marseille. Likewise the pasquells and libells without names, dayly throwne downe in the towne of Paris, and the disdainfull speeches dayly vttered of the King, speaking of him as a <HI>Sardanapalus,</HI> and a Prince drowned in his pleasures and de|lights, and for his third crowne which hee looked for in heaven, promising him one made with a rasour in a Cloy|ster: all these things presented to the Kings minde a suf|ficient vnderstanding of the resolution and purpose of the Leaguers&punc; Notwithstanding feare so possessed his minde, that in stead of couragious resisting of the Leaguers in due time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King for lacke of cou|rage maketh himself a slaue to the appe|tites of he Leaguers.</NOTE> hee made himselfe a slaue to their appetites. The ar|my of the Duke of Guise (who was made Generall of the fellowship of the league) at the first rising, exceeded not the number of a thousand horsemen, and foure thousand foot|men: which company might easily haue beene dispersed, if the valorous courage of the King had not beene vtterly abashed: who in stead of commanding with authority, de|sired the Queene mother to procure that the Duke of Guise might leaue off armes, and to assure him of his favour, and that he would giue him what part of his Realme hee would aske to let him liue in peace.</P>
<P>This their enterprise succeeding so well, farre aboue their owne expectation, mooved them to set forward, and to de|sire of the King that hee would make and sweare an irrevo|cable edict of extirpation of Heretikes: To take by force the townes holden by those of the new religion: To re|nounce the protection of Geneva, to authorize their warres, to reconcile them vnto him, to bee of their league, and of a King to become a participant. Wherevpon followed an
<PB N="237" REF="127">
edict prohibiting the exercise of the new religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An edict a|gainst the Pro|testants.</NOTE> and re|voking all other edicts that favoured it, commanding all the Ministers out of the Land, and all subiects in France within six moneths after to make profession of the Catho|like religion, or to depart out of the Realme. Dispersing al|so the tripertite chambers of Parliaments, likewise orday|ning that the townes given in hostage to those of the reli|gion, should be yeelded vp, and approving the warre which the Leaguers had begun, acknowledging it to be done for his service.</P>
<P>And not content with this, they asked of the King for their further surety, the townes of Chalon, Thoul, Verdi|um, Saint Desier, Rhems, Soissons, the Castle of Dyon, the towne and castle of Beaume, Rue in Picardie, Dinan and Con&abque; in Brittaine, to be delivered vnto them.</P>
<P>The King of Navarre all this while kept himselfe quiet, being solicited by the King so to doe. But when hee saw the King had rendered himselfe to the appetite of the Lea|guers, hee set forth a declaration of the cause, why the Lea|guers had taken armes, of the vanity of their pretences, and of the fruits which the Estates in France might reape by the conclusions of Peronne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of Navarre and the Prince of Condie with diverse others, oppose them|selues to the Leaguers.</NOTE> Nemours, and Nauty, (for in those places the Leaguers had bound vp their league) with pro|testation that with him, the Prince of Condie his cousen, the Duke de Mommerencie, with Lords, Gentlemen, Pro|vinces, and Townes, both of the one religion and of the o|ther, so many as would concurre with him, should oppose themselues to the authors of these troubles.</P>
<P>In the meane time, while the King of Navarre is so bu|sied with the King and the Leaguers, who were now as it were incorporate in one bodie: the third assault commeth on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pope ex|co~municateth the King of France.</NOTE> and Pope <HI>Sixtus</HI> the fift, with his thunderbolts of ex|communication setteth vpon him, declaring him to be vn|capable of the crowne of France, abandoning his person, and his countrey for a prey to such as should obtaine them. At the same time also, the Electors of Germany, who in all the former warres had beene so helpfull to the Protestants
<PB N="238" REF="128">
of France, was not vnmindfull of them at so strait a pinch, but sent Ambassadours to the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Germany send Ambassodors to deale for the Protestants helpe.</NOTE> desiring him to heare the requests of his neighbours, and to pity the case of his poore subiects, and not to keepe backe the edict of peace, that hee had lately graunted vnto them. The King answe|red that hee thought strange that forrain Princes should meddle with his affaires: and that he would doe nothing a|gainst the honour of his conscience, nor the fatherly care he had vnto his people. With this answer the Ambassadours returned, not well pleased.</P>
<P>The Duke of Guise being advertised of the dislike the Ambassadours of Germany had touching their answere,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The sixt civill war in France for religion.</NOTE> counselled the King to set vpon the Protestants before the Rutters entred into France, so that in lesse then eighteene moneths the King of Navarre saw himselfe assayled by fiue Camps royall, vnder fiue severall Generals. Neverthelesse very few exploites worthy of remembrance were done by those armies, vntill the army of the Germanes entred into France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An army of Germans en|ter France in behalfe of the Protestants.</NOTE> vnder the conduct of the Baron of Othna, a man of greater courage then experience. The Duke of Bulloigne in the name of the King of Navarre, ioyned with the Baron of Othna, to leade this great army, wherein were moe then thirty thousand Switzers, Rutters, and French-men. They marched from Loraine to Cheaumont in Bassigny, and passed the river of Marne, also they crossed l' Anbe at Mon|tigny and Seine aboue Casklion, and Cure aboue Vermen|tone and Yome, hard by Crenaunt, and so made haste to|wards the river of Loire. There began the complaints of the Switzers and the mutinies of the Rutters, because the King of Navarre came not to them, and the King of France was at the side of the river Loire, either to fight with them, or to stay their passage. At this time the King vsed a stra|tagem, which was the cause of his victory, and of the dis|sipation of the army of strangers. For hee considered that the onely meanes to breake their army, was to impeach their ioyning with the King of Navarre. Therefore he comman|ded the Duke Ioyense to keepe the King of Navarre in
<PB N="239" REF="128">
Poictou, and rather to hazard battell, then suffer him to passe the river of Loire, as hee determined at the head there|of: to the which end the Duke de Ioyense that had an army fortified, both with men, munition, artillery, and meanes marched to Coutras, to passe la Drogne at Que, and vpon tuesday the twentith of October, <HI>Anno</HI> 1587. he stayd with all his forces betweene la Rotch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The battell of Coutras be|twixt the Kings army &amp; the Protesta~ts.</NOTE> Chalais, and Coutras. The King of Navarre made toward him, fully resolved to fight, and about eight of the clocke in the morning, the King of Navarres artillery began to play, and that of Duke de Ioy|ense to answer them, but not very fortunately, for that ei|ther the ignorance or malice of the Canoners had placed it so low, that the mouth of the canon, shot right vpon a lit|tle hill of earth, wherein the bullets stayed without pier|cing any further. The battell was so soone decided, that in ten houres this great army of the Kings (that had the van|tage both for place and number) began to retyre and was sooner broken then fought withall.</P>
<P>The King of Navarre, the Prince of Condie, and the Earle of Soissons behaved themselues most valiantly, exe|cuting the offices both of Captaines and souldiers, and gaue thankes to God in open field.</P>
<P>In this battell Duke de Ioyense and Monsieur de S. Sau|ueur his brother were slaine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The death of D. de Ioyense.</NOTE> and fiue and twenty other Gentlemen of name: all their cornets were taken, with their artillery and baggage, and fourteene Gentlemen of account were taken and put to ransome. That done, the King of Navarre being eased of so many nets that were set vp to catch him, marched forward to ioyne with the forraine ar|my, and to passe the river Loire. The King on the other part to impeach the meeting of the two armies of his ad|versaries, caused the ditches betweene Povilly and Dony to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e broken vppe, filling them with thousands of trees, stones, and chaines to entangle the feet of the Rutters horse that should passe: and in truth the letting of that passage, was next to the helpe of God, the second cause the King had of the victory. For the Rutters being disappointed of their
<PB N="240" REF="129">
passage were compelled to recoile, and having failed of their enterprise at la Charitie, they entred in the way of Beauce, drawing towards Montargis. From this time forth a great mutinie began in the army of the strangers, being mooved with impatience, because they could neither haue money nor sight of the King of Navarre: whereof the King being then at Bonevall had intelligence, and thereupon vsed all the meanes hee could to sound the hearts of the Switzers, and perswaded them to separate themselues from the rest of the army, and retyre home: whereunto the Switzers con|discended, and vpon agreement of 400000. crownes payed to them in ready money, they returned backe againe to their owne countrey. The Duke of Guise perceiving the army of the Rutters to be as a body dispersed, hauing nothing left but the armes and legges, tooke boldnesse to set vpon them as they camped at Aunew,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A skirmish be|twixt the D. of Guise and the Rutters.</NOTE> and entred with his footmen in|to the streets, about the time that the carts and baggage were ready in the morning to issue out, and so couragiously sur|prised the Rutters at their breakefast: when the trumpets began to sound a chivall, having no meanes to issue out, they were constrained to retyre into their lodgings, at the pleasure of the assaylants. The booty was great, being 800. chariots, iewels and chaines of gold, and two thousand horse, both for the field and waggons. The gates being seazed vpon, and the streets chained, there was no meanes to saue themselues but by the walles, which the Generall leaped ouer.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding of this surprise, the army of the Rutters was in such estate, that by reason of some small assurance they had of the King of Navarres arrivall, it was likely to haue overcome the Duke of Guise forces. And as it was at point to retyre backe againe, the Prince of Condie, the Duke of Bulloigne, and the Lords of Chastilli|on and Cleruant, promised to pay them all their wages, if they would march forward. The hope of their pay made them to march in a time not very convenient, to|wards the Forrest of Orleance. The King perceived that
<PB N="241" REF="129">
the longer the armie kept the fields, the greater would be the ruine of his Countrey, and that, being ioyned with the king of Navarre would doe great hurt, caused the Sienrs of the Isle of Cormont to certifie the Coronels that if they would yeeld vp their colours, and sweare to beare no armes in Fraunce without the expresse comman|dement of his Maiestie hee would giue them assurance to retire in safetie. They on the other part perceauing themselues to be farre from the king of Navarre, hardlie handled by the Frenchmen, beaten by the league, pursued by the king, and forsaken of the Switzers, assembled them|selues together at Marsigni:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rutters retire out of France.</NOTE> and accepted his Maiesties of|fers sent by Monsieur <HI>D' Esperno,</HI> and retired out of France toward Geneua.</P>
<P>The Marques <HI>Du pont,</HI> eldest sonne to the Duke of Loraine, and the Duke of Guise, against their faith giuen, followed the miserable troupe of the Rutters to the moun|taine at Saint <HI>Clande,</HI> where they gaue thankes for the good successe of their companie: and from thence to please their hungrie troupes they trauersed the Countrie of Bour|goundie, entering into the Countries of Mombeliard and Hericourt, where his men vsed diuers great cruelties and spared not the lands of the Bishop of Basile.</P>
<P>After the bloodie ceasing of so lamentable vengeance vpon a poore innocent people, which as yet doe feele the losse and destruction of two hundred villages, the violence vsed to a number of women and maids, the Massacre of so many old men, and the furious and beastlie inhumanitie of the League, they beare the signes of their spoyles into Loraine.</P>
<P>Neuerthelesse after this exploite of the Duke of Guise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of Guise hono|red by the Pope, and ex|tolled by the Preachers of France for his crueltie.</NOTE> so full of crueltie, falshood &amp; inhumanitie, the Roman Church extolled him aboue all measure.

<P>The Duke of Guise came to the King at Soissons to constraine the King either to bow or breake, and to con|firme the articles drawne, and deuised at Nancie and Dy|ion.</P>
<P>The King on the other part, by Mousieur de <HI>Bellieure</HI> gaue the Duke to vnderstand, that he should doe him a pleasure if he would abstaine from comming to Paris in so trouble|some a time, wherein so many factions raigned: and if hee came thither against his will: hee would lay the cause of all the troubles that might arise by his presence vpon him.</P>
<P>But the Duke of Guises heart, as it were attainted with a

burning feauer could find neither appetite nor pleasure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of Guise contra|rie to the king<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> commande|ment arriueth at Paris and is of the peo|ple receiued with ioyfull acclamations.</NOTE> but in that which liked his stomach, would needes for the loouer or die by the way: and therefore mounted on horse|backe with eight Gentlemen, about nine of the clocke at night, leauing the Prince de <HI>Iumueille</HI> his sonne at Soissons, and desiring the Archbishop of Lyons to follow him in the morning, and so arriued at Paris.</P>
<P>This maner of arriuall together with the peoples fauour vttered by their ioyfull acclamations at the Duke of Guises lighting increased the distrust of the kings heart, so that hee resolued to preuent the enterprises intended against him, and commanded the Marescall <HI>Biron</HI> to cause foure thousand Switzers to enter into the Towne and to lodge them in diuers quarters thereof, who seased incontinent vpon the bridges of Nostredame and Saint <HI>Michael.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The fearefull day of <HI>Barri|cadoes</HI> in Paris</NOTE> But the Parisians being abashed at the sight shut vp their shoppes, and tooke their weapones in their hands, and brought forth their Barricadoes (which was a sediti|ous invention of the league) each one distant from another thirtie foote, and reached almost to the Sentinell of the Loouer.</P>
<P>The Switzers were set vpon and they yeelded, crying <HI>Viue</HI> Guise, and Monsieur de <HI>Brissac</HI> caused them to be disarmed: and Sienre de S. <HI>Paul</HI> caused the kings guarde to retire, hol|ding down their armes with hatts in hand.

The D. although he layed the fault vpon the people, yet neither would hee stay the commotion, neither goe the Loover to the king.</P>
<P>The Queen marking the stubbornnesse and resolution of the Duke of Guise, caused the king to be aduertised, who desiring not to stay any longer in that trance, issued out of Paris by the new-gate, and so happily eschewed the Trage|die of Chilperic,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The king fli|eth out of Paris.</NOTE> and the new crowne of the razour pre|pared for him by the Leaguers: from Paris hee went to Chartresse, and from thence to Roane, fretting in heart

for the indignation hee had sustained in Paris, and being determined, one way or other, to be auenged on the Duke of Guise; the chiefe Captaine of the league, and the author of the Barricadoes. The chiefe thing that hindred this reso|lution for a time was the two extremities wherewith hee found himselfe beset: for either he must make peace with the Protestants, or strengthen himselfe with their forces; or else of new againe adioyne himselfe to the league, because hee was not able to match them both at one time.</P>
<P>In the end hee resolued to ioyne with the league againe and by a new edict set forth in Iuly <HI>Anno,</HI> 1588.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An edict pub|lished against the Prote|stants.</NOTE> he ratefi|ed the decrees of the leaguers at Nemours which they had made, <HI>Anno</HI> 1585. containing in effect &amp; substance the same things that were afterward decreed in Nancy.</P>
<P>Moreouer hee remitted and excused the fact done a|gainst him in the towne of Paris: acknowledging it was done by them for the zeale of the Catholike religion. And lest he should seeme to foster in his minde some secret cho|ler against the leaguers: he bestowed his liberalities and fa|uours vpon the principall heads thereof. To the Duke of Guise hee gaue the office of Lieutenant Generall ouer all the forces throughout the Realme of Fraunce. To the Cardinall of Guise his Brother hee promised to procure the Pope to giue him the office of Legat of Anignon. To Duke <HI>De Maine</HI> was giuen a faire and great armie in Dolpkin.</P>
<P>He gaue the Duke Nemours the government of Lyons. Hee forgot not the Archbishop of Lyons, but made him one of his priuie Counsel, before being only of the counsell of estate: and finally declared the Cardinall of Burbon to be the chiefe Prince of the blood royall, thereby whollie to ex|clude the king of Navarre from the crowne, The leaguers on the other part haue the wind in their saile &amp; fearing that this great goodnesse of the king would not continue, ceased not vntil they had procured all his wise Counsellers to be remo|ued, and two armies to be leauied against the Protestants, the

They presentlie made a collection of money to maintaine warres; the poorest artificer amongst them was content at least to import six crownes;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The rebellion of the league against the king.</NOTE> gold ranne like a Riuer a long the streetes; they eleuated the Duke of Guise to the hea|uens and with open mouth spoke euill of the king, detesting his actions, abhorring his life, and accounting the execution done at Bloyse as most cruell, barbarous and inhumane. Many other townes followed the example of Paris, namely Amiens, Dijon, Orleance, Tullose. The Doctors of Sorbon published their decree, importing that the people of Fraunce, were freed and absolued from the oath of fidelitie and obedience made to <HI>Henry</HI> the third; and that the same people might lawfullie and with good con|science arme and vnite themselues together for defence of the Roman Church against the king or his adherents whatsoe|uer.</P>
<P>The report of those vprores, hastned the dissolution of the Parliament, which was dissolued in Ianuarie, 1589. and the king made for warre to suppresse the rebellious insurrection of the league: and immediatlie hee tran|slated to the towne of Tours such exercises of Iustice, as were accustomed to bee performed in his Court of Parliament of Paris, and depriued Paris with the townes

of all offices, charges, dignitie and priuiledges what|soeuer, as guiltie of rebellion, fellonie, and high trea|son against his Maiesties estate, and Person. Now the king was brought to that pinch by the insolencie of the league, that hee behoued to take truce with the king of Nauarre, and to fortifie himselfe with the assistance of his forces, and hee gaue to the king of Nauarre Sau|mure for securitie of his passage ouer Loire, by meanes whereof the king of Nauarre caused all his troupes to passe ouer on this side of Loire, to ioyne with the forces of Nor|mandie, Maine, and other places which attended him with intention to approach the leaguers.</P>
<P>The Duke <HI>De Maine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Duke <HI>De Maine</HI> sendeth men to sur|prise the king but is preuen|ted.</NOTE> on the other part being chiefe commaunder of the Leaguers armie, made a selection of their resolutest men, and marched into Vendesmois with an intention to surprise the king, in Tours where hee was not verie stronglie guarded; but the king was eased of this feare by the sudden arriuall of the king of Nauarre for his reliefe.</P>
<P>In Normandie Duke <HI>Monpensier</HI> with forces for the king, besieged Salaize a Towne that held for the league, and Count <HI>Brissac,</HI> accompanied with two or three hundreth, gentlemen leaguers, and with them fiue or six thousand men came to support the towne. Duke <HI>Mont|pensier</HI> hearing of those newes left the siege of the towne and set vpon Count <HI>Brissac</HI> and his armie, being lodged in three villages, and slew of them more than 3000. men; and tooke 1200 prisoners amongst whom were 30. Gen|tlemen of the chiefest. This was a bad presagement for the League.</P>
<P>In like manner at the siege of Senlis (a Towne of Fraunce lying betweene Paris and Picardie) which the Parisians besieged, because it was a Towne of great im|portance, the Duke of Longoveille came with support to the Towne; vpon which, battell ensued: wherein, 1500. of the assailants were slaine and all their artillerie and baggage was taken.</P>

<P>After the Kings death, the image and portraiture of the traiterous Monke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Iacobin who killed the K. canonized.</NOTE> who killed the King by the commande|ment of the chiefe of the league, was most artificially framed in brasse, &amp; other paintings, wherewith they garnished both their houses and their Churches.

<P>But King <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, after he had buryed the corps of his predecessor, tooke his first iourney to Normandy, where the Pont to Larch was yeelded to him:<NOTE PLACE="marg">K. <HI>Henry</HI> the 4. declared K. by K. <HI>Henry</HI> the 3. opposeth him|selfe to the Leaguers.</NOTE> Then hee came to Deepe, wonne Caen vnto his side, and constrained Neuscastle to be rendered into his hands. And hauing made a show to besiege Roane, it caused Duke de maine being called to the succour by Aumalle and Brissac, to set himself in the field with more then 3000. horsemen, and 5000. foot|men, who promised to the Parisians, at that time to make an end of all warre, and to bring their enemy bound vnto them both hand and foot. The King marching toward his enemies, encamped at a certaine village called Arques, a|bout two miles from Deep, and so entrenched it about on all sides, that hee might easily ouerrunne the enemy at all times.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="134">The Duke de Maine lay about Arques, from the end of August vntill the midst of September, gayning nothing but losse of his best approoved souldiers, and nine or ten of their Captaines.</P>
<P>This first enterprise against the King did truely presage vnto them what successe they were like to haue in all their attempts to come, wherof followed nothing else but shame and sorrow. This done, the King by easie iourneys drew nigh to Paris, and entred by force the suburbs of S. Iaques, and being advertised that the Duke de Maine was come forth of Picardie, and with all his forces had entered into Paris, hee stayed foure long houres in battell, to see if any of the Leaguers would issue out to fight. Afterward hee departed from Paris, and tooke the townes of Ven|dosme, and Mans, and Falaize, wherein Count <HI>Brissac</HI> was taken prisoner: also hee recovered Honfleur, a towne vp|on the Sea coast in Normandie, and compelled the Duke de Maine to raise his siege from the towne and fort of Meu|lan. In the beginning of March, the Duke de Maine with all his forces passed over the bridge of Maule, which is a|bout eight miles from Dreux: whereof the King being advertised, provided for his affaires, and the twelfth of the same moneth, set himselfe on the way to goe against his e|nemies. On the thirtith day the King after hee had ordered his army,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The battell of Dreux, where|in the Lea|guers were discomfited.</NOTE> made an earnest prayer to God, and looked for battell, but there were nothing but skirmishes, wherein the Leaguers had the worst. The next day the battels ioyned neere to the towne of Dreux, wherein the King obtained a great victory, and overthrew all the footmen of the Lea|guers, which were counted to the number of twelue thou|sand men. Onely the Switzers who cast downe their wea|pons, and yeelded to the King, together with the French|men who were mingled amongst them, had their liues spa|red: also fifteene hundred horsemen of the Leaguers were slaine and drowned, and foure hundred taken prisoners. The Duke de Maine fled towards Dreux, and when he was entred the towne, broke vp the bridge before his owne
<PB N="253" REF="134">
people were all come, which was the cause of the death of a great number of his army, especially of the Rutters, of whom a great sort were drowned. In this battell the army had their ioy mixed with sorrow, at the first: for they saw not the King returne, but within a while after, they espyed him comming all stained with the blood of his enemies, not having shed one droppe of his owne (whom they dis|cryed onely by the great plume of white fethers, which hee had in his creast, and that which his palfrey had on his head) all the army gaue hearty thankes to God for his safe|tie, crying with one voyce, God saue the King.</P>
<P>The Duke de Maine and other Captaines of the league being frustrate of their hope, and seeing their army thus spoyled; betooke themselues to their ordinarie shifts, which was to feed the Parisians with fable and lyes: publishing that in the battell they had almost eq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">all losse, and that the King if hee was not already dead, hee was neare vnto it. But the people being every day more and more ascertained of the truth, began to grudge, and to be desirous of peace, so that the Duke of Maine tooke his iourney towards the Duke of Parma, to obtaine support from him.</P>
<P>The King drew nigh to Paris,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King be|siegeth Paris.</NOTE> and shut vp the passages of the river of Seane, being master of Mance and Poyssie on the one side, and Corbell Melum, and Monterean on the other side of Paris; so that neither from aboue, nor from below, could any provision bee carryed to Paris by the river of Seane: likewise by taking of Lagnay, and the fort of Gonrey, hee stopped the passage of the river of Merue, and by taking Compienge, Creil, and Beaumont, hee stopped the passage of the river of Oisso, or Ayne.</P>
<P>In that populous towne the famine was soone felt, and within the space of three moneths, moe then an hundred thousand dyed in the towne: yet the most part of them stir|red vp by the seditious Preachers, were content rather to en|dure an hundred deathes, then to acknowledge their owne soveraigne King, whom they called an Heretique, and a favourer of them.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="135">The Duke de Maine having obtained promise of support from the Duke of Parma, returned from Beuxellis, whom the King pursued from Laon to Meux, where hee inclosed himselfe betweene two rivers, waiting for the comming of the Duke of Parma. The King hoped for battell so soone as the Duke of Parma was ioyned with the Duke de Maine, but the Duke of Parma got vp to an hill to view his ene|mies army, and after hee had throughly noted it, hee tooke resolution not to fight,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of Parma entreth France for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eliefe of Paris.</NOTE> but to fortifie and entrench his army within a great marrash, and so by meanes of his intrench|ments, hee eschewed the hazard of battell, and came to Pa|ris, and named himselfe the deliverer of it. But after he had stayed a while in Paris, the principall Captaines of the league, began to giue the Duke of Parma thankes for his good will, and entreated him to goe with his people to Breuxelis againe.</P>
<P>This request or secret command, fell out very well for the Duke. For on the one part, his army was seene by all men dayly to waste, and himselfe did plainely behold that hee stood in the midst of an inconstant multitude. There|fore hee dressed himselfe homeward with all possible speed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of Parma retur|neth home.</NOTE> and the king pursued him to the very frontiers of Artoys. The Duke of Parmaes comming, serued to none other pur|pose but to fill their purses with the gold of Peru, and to entangle and bring their affaires vnto a remedilesse end: for in the beginning of the yeere 1591. the King conti|nued his siege, and the Parisians were fallen into their won|ted distresses, as before. But we leaue for a while, and marke the estate of the rest of the countrey.</P>
<P>In the countrey of Dauphein, <HI>Francis de Bonne,</HI> Lord of Diguireres,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In all other places of France the Leaguers went to ruine.</NOTE> chased the Leaguers out of that part, and be|came master of Grenoble. In Normandy the Duke of Montpensier, wonne Honfleur, and forced the Leaguers to forsake field. In Poictou the Vicount dela Guerche, com|manding over certaine regiments of footmen, and horse|men, and finding about a thousand of naturall borne Spa|niards, newly come from Brittaine to doe some great ex|ployt,
<PB N="255" REF="135">
they were all charged by the Baron de la Rotche Pose, and others of the Kings chiefe servitors. In this con|flict la Guerche was compelled to see 300. Gentlemen of his most assured favourers, slaine, and lying on the ground, at the which sight hee was so abashed, that hee fled to the next river, where finding the boat, and thinking to goe over ea|sily, the throng was so great, that the boate and all the pas|sengers sunke to the bottome: La Guerche was there drowned, with a great number of others. There perished in the water and in the fight, moe then seven hundred Spainards: some supposed this losse of the Leaguers to be little lesse then that of Coutras, by reason of the great num|ber of the Nobility that dyed therein. Likewise the Lord Digners overthrew in the plaine of Portcharre, the Duke Savoyes army, commanded by <HI>Amedio,</HI> the Dukes bastard sonne, and Don <HI>Pleneres,</HI> a Spanish Captaine, and the Marquis of Treuic, and others. There were slaine vpon that plaine, 2000. and 500. of the Dukes army, and a great number were taken prisoners, being for the most part Gentlemen of command. The booty which was got|ten, amounted to the summe of two hundred thousand crownes.</P>
<P>The next day two thousand Romanes and souldiers of Millaine, who with their Commander, the Earle of Galcot of Belioyense, were saved within the Castle of d' Analon, at length yeelded themselues to the Kings mercy: but the fury of the souldiers could not bee quenched, till they had slaine sixe or seven hundred of them. The rest having white roddes in their hands given them in stead of pasports, were sent home to Italy.</P>
<P>In the meane time the King handled his affaires so bu|sily, that hee had taken the townes of Chartresse and Noy|on, and taken order that Paris should still bee inclosed on every side: so that the great tribute and taxes which were gathered for the bringing in of victuals to the Parisians, and for the maintenance of their troopes, did gleane away their money peece after peece, and brought the people to great

poverty. Likewise the King after the taking of Noyon, sent som of his troops to Normandie, to tame those of Roan, who shewed themselues no lesse obstinate then the Parisi|ans. The Leaguers had none other shift, but againe to cry for ayde of the Duke of Parma: who entred into France the second time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of Parma entreth France the 2. time in behalfe of the Lea|guers, but with bad successe.</NOTE> with foure thousand footmen, and three thousand horsemen, besides some Italians conducted by S. <HI>Fondrat</HI> Earle of Mont Martian, and three thousand Switzers. At this his approaching to Roane, the towne of Candebec was yeelded to him, howbeit he did not keep it long: and hee entred into Roane, but made no tarrying there, because his purpose was to set forward to Paris.</P>
<P>The King on the other part, sent to all the neighbour townes, such as Louviers, Mance, Menlan, Vernon, and o|thers, where his garrisons were, that they should march to|wards him, which was speedily performed: so that in sixe dayes, his army grew to more then three thousand horse|men, and six thousand footmen. With this companie the King followed the Duke of Parmaes army, and charged diverse times so roughly, that at one time they lost six hun|dred of their number, another time, two thousand and fiue hundred, and so fled shamefully towardes Paris, and from thence to Brie, and last they came to Artoys: where within few moneths the Duke of Parma with his troopes melted, like waxe in the Sunne.

By whose perswasion the King was induced to heare and see masse sung, in the Cathedrall Church of Saint <HI>Denise,</HI> the fiue and twentith day of Iuly. All this asswaged not the fu|rie of the Leaguers, who still continued in their wonted malice against the King, and stirred vp a wicked man, cal|led <HI>Peter Burrier,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Peter Burrier</HI> stirred vp to slay the King.</NOTE> <HI>alias, Bar,</HI> borne at Orleance, to slay the King. This man was committed to prison at Melun, the sixe and twentith day of August, where hee confessed that hee was seduced by a Capushan Fryer at Lyons, and by a Curat and Vicar of Paris, and also by a Iesuit, closely to fol|low the King, and to murther him with a two edged knife,

which also was found about him: He was drawne through the streets of Melun, where then the King was; they cut off his right arme holding the murthering knife therein, and after burned the same: also his armes, legs, and thigh|bones were broken vpon a wheele, where he languished cer|taine houres till hee dyed.</P>
<P>The King seeing that the malice of his enemies still con|tinued, resolued no longer to beare the same, wherefore hee caused a declaration to be imprinted and published in the beginning of the yeere,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The K. oppo|seth himself to the Leaguers.</NOTE> 1594. containing an Oration of the mischiefes and vnfaithfull practises of the Leaguers. Prescribing a moneths liberty as well to the chiefe of the Leaguers, as to the clergie, cities, townes, communalties, yea, and to all men generally within the same, to ac|knowledge him their King, and to submit themselues to his gouernment. The time once past, hee would revoke his grace &amp; favour, accounting them to be rebells, and guilty of high treason, for contempt of his Kingly offer.</P>
<P>The report of this declaration, and the preparations which the King made to chastise their stubborne opini|ons: amazed the very principall of the league, and the most part of the rebellious townes and commons. The towne of Meux in Brie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diuers towns yeeld them|selues to the King.</NOTE> a small iourney from Paris, yeelded thems|selues to the King, the eleventh of Ianuary: and by a pithy letter, exhorted the Parisians to follow their example.

Last of all, the towne of Paris yeelded to the King, in the moneth of March. Wherein it is to bee noted, that the Kings troopes entred so peaceably into the towne, that within two houres after, the shops were all set open, and the towne appeared so peaceable, as if there had never beene any change. In Pi|cardie the towne of laon was fortified against the King, by

the Spaniards forces, &amp; yet was compelled to yeeld Soissons and La Fere, which were possessed by the Duke <HI>de Maine,</HI> and the Spaniards would not yeeld: and the towne and fort of Blauel in Britannie was also fortified against the King. But now seeing the League inclined to an hastie ruine, the last refuge was by horrible treason, to cut off <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iohn Castill</HI> stirred vp by the Leaguers to murther the King, is disappointed of his purpose&punc;</NOTE> as they had done <HI>Henry</HI> the third before.

But by reason his Maiesty was very readie to take vp the Lords which were on their knees before him, in his stooping he strucke him in the face on the vpper iaw on the right side, therewithall cutting out one of his teeth. Presently this miserable caitiue was ta|ken, and after examination, vnderstanding that he was a scholler of the Iesuites, the King said, And must it needs be that the Iesuits must be confounded by my mouth.</P>

It was sacriledge indeed and a proud contempt of God in the person of <HI>Baltasar,</HI> to drinke common wine with his harlots in the vessels of gold dedica|ted to the holy seruice of God, but an holy preacher to walke in the same apparell in the streete wherein he preached and ministred the communion in the Church, this is no sinne nor a thing forbidden by any Apostolike precept.

<P>The Romane church desirous to be masked with a shewe of antiquitie, they haue attributed Canons to the Apostles which are not found in their writings. Yet it is a shame to the forgers of these canons to be found the principall im|pugners and transgressers of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>cap.</HI> 5.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="foreign">, that is to say, <HI>A Bishop, elder, or deacon, who vnder pretence of religion putteth away his owne wife, if he cast her off, let him be ex|communicated: and if hee perseuere in so doing, let him be depo|sed.</HI> How can this constitution of <HI>Stephanus</HI> agree with the Canons of the Apostles? Heere I appeale to the consciences of honest and vpright men if they finde not that the lie is not onely repugnant vnto the veritie, but also vnto it selfe. The supposititious Canons of the Apostles, and the sup+posititious constitutions of <HI>Stephanus</HI> cannot both con|sist. I know what they answere, viz. that the Canons of the Apostles speake of those Bishops, Elders, and Deacons, who had wiues when they were admitted to ecclesiasticall offices, these should not put away their wiues vnder pretence of religion: but concerning others who were vnmarried in the time of their admission the 25. Canon declareth otherwise. <GAP DESC="foreign">,

It is an vnsufferable thing to heare such leuitie and inconstancie imputed to the holy Apostles, that they debarred no man from the office of a Bishop, Elder or Deacon, because he was a married man. O but if any man enter vnmarried to be a Bishop, Elder, or Deacon, then hee must not marrie. If marriage had beene an vncleane thing it might haue debarred men from entering into holy offices, but if it be a cleane thing, it cannot exclude them after they haue entred.</P>

When hee came to Rome, hee was not free of the envie and reproaches of the clergie of the Romane Church, and mooved with anger, hee declined to the opinion of the he|retique <HI>Montanus,</HI> and wrote books against the true Church, such as the volumes following, <HI>De pudicitia, De persecutione, De i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iuni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, De monogamia, De exsasi, lib.</HI> 6. and his seventh booke against <HI>Apollonius.</HI></P>
<P>This lamentable defection of <HI>Tertullian,</HI> may bee an ex|ample to all men of great vnderstanding and excellent lear|ning, not to bee puft vp, nor to be high minded, lest they fall into the snare of the divell. For <HI>Tertullian</HI> wrote learned apologies for the Christians,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ierom. catal. scrip. eccles. Hist. Magd. cent.</HI> 3. <HI>cap.</HI> 10.</NOTE> and mightily confuted the er|rour of <HI>Marcion</HI>: notwithstanding of all this, hee was high minded, and ioyned himselfe to the opinion of <HI>Montanus.</HI> If hee had kept himselfe free of this foule spot, hee was wor|thie for his gifts to haue beene counted amongst the most famous Doctors of the Church, after the dayes of the A|postles.</P>
<P><HI>Origen</HI> the sonne of <HI>Leonides</HI> an Egyptian,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Origen.</HI></NOTE> was a young man of seventeene yeeres of age, when his father was mar|tyred, in the persecution of <HI>Severus.</HI> His wit was so preg|nant in his youth, and so capable of all kinde of instructi|on, that his father would often vncover his brest when hee was a sleepe,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hist. Magd. cent.</HI> 3. <HI>cap.</HI> 10.</NOTE> and kisse it, giving thankes to God, who had made him father of so happy a sonne. After his fathers death, hee sustayned himselfe, his mother, and six brethren by keeping a Schoole, for all his fathers goods was confis|cate, for his confession of Christ.</P>
<P>When <HI>Origen</HI> had spent his young age, the description
<PB N="284" REF="150">
of his life, in Greeke saith; <GAP DESC="foreign">, that is, when hee was in his mid-age, the Churches of Achaia vexed with heretiques, sent for him: and as hee was vpon his iourney to Athens, hee went through Palestina, and was ordained to be a Presbyter or Priest, by <HI>Alexander</HI> Bishop of Ierusa|lem, and <HI>Theoctistus</HI> Bishop of Caesarea. This fact offended <HI>Demetrius</HI> Bishop of Alexandria, so highly, that he was full of rage against <HI>Origen</HI>: and wherefore? because he being a man of Alexandria received ordination to an Ecclesiasticall office, from the Bishops of Ierusalem, and Caesarea.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE>When Bishops become serious in trifling matters, and haue a greater regarde to their owne glory, then to the ad|vancement of the kingdome of God: then that may bee spoken of them, which <HI>Ierome</HI> writeth of <HI>Demetrius, Qui tanta in eum debacchatus est insania, vt per totum mundum su|per eius nomine scriberet,</HI> that is, Hee was so full of rage a|gainst him, that hee replenished the world with writings mentioning the name of <HI>Origen.</HI> But consider what fault was in <HI>Origen,</HI> who was craving no ordination: And what fault was in <HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Theoctistus,</HI> men whose names shall be had in everlasting remembrance. They did nothing of intention to grieue the heart of <HI>Demetrius</HI> Bishop of A|lexandria, but onely being carefull of the advancement of the kingdome of God, they endeavoured to strengthen the hands of <HI>Origen,</HI> against the heretickes of Achaia, by con|ferring vnto him, the calling of a Presbyter. No man can iustly offend against me, if I cast in this sentence, as a com|mon admonition to all Preachers, <GAP DESC="foreign">, Let vs not bee ouer serious in ridiculous matters. The name of <HI>Origen</HI> was so famous, that not onely the Bi|shops of Achaia, sollicited him to come to their bounds for stopping the mouthes of Heretickes, but also hee was sent for at two diverse times to be present at the Councels con|vened in Arabia, against heretickes. Some Heretickes af|ffirmed that the soules of men perish with their bodies, and are raised vp againe in the day of the resurrection,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Coment. Func. in Chron. l.</HI> 6.</NOTE> with the bodies, whom <HI>Origen</HI> mightily refuted. Likewise, hee
<PB N="285" REF="150">
was present at the Councell in Arabia, gathered against <HI>Be|rillus</HI> Bishop of Bostra, who denyed that Christ was existent before his manifestation in the flesh, and by the travelles of <HI>Origen, Berillus</HI> was reclaimed and reduced to the true faith: therefore I reckon him not in the roll of heretickes.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Euseb. l.</HI> 6. <HI>c.</HI> 33.</NOTE> <HI>Fir|milianus</HI> Bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia, invited <HI>Origen</HI> to come to Cappadocia, where hee detained him a long time. Likewise <HI>Mammea</HI> the mother of <HI>Alexander</HI> the Emperour, sent for him, to come to Antiochia, and had him in reve|rent regard. Likewise hee wrote to the Emperour <HI>Philip,</HI> and to his mother, who was the first Emperour that professed the name of Christ.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ierom. catal. script. Eccles.</HI></NOTE> Hee studied to bee acquainted with the Hebrew language, farre contrary to the custome of his owne Nation: and hee conferred the Hebrew text with the Greeke translations, not onely the Septuagints, but also the translations of <HI>Aquila,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Euseb. l</HI> 6. <HI>c.</HI> 17.</NOTE> <HI>Theodosion,</HI> and <HI>Symmachus,</HI> and he found out the fift, sixt, and seventh editions.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding all these excellent gifts and renowned fame of <HI>Origen,</HI> hee wanted not his owne grosse errours, and foolish facts. In expounding of Scriptures, he became a curious searcher out of allegories. Yet this father of alle|gories <HI>Origen,</HI> mistooke the words of Christ spoken of Eu|nuches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 19.12.</NOTE> <HI>There bee some chaste, which haue made themselues chaste for the kingdome of heauen</HI>: these words, I say, spoken in an allegor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">coll sense, hee tooke in a simple and vnfigurate meaning,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Euseb. l.</HI> 6. <HI>c.</HI> 8.</NOTE> and gelded himselfe, to the end hee might liue without all suspition of vncleannesse. No learned man hath commended this fact of <HI>Origen,</HI> so farre as my reading can extend, for if a man might lawfully dismember his own body, to the end hee might liue chastely, why might not a man in like manner cut off his owne hand, to the end he should not in hastie motion of anger kill his neighhour? But the obedience of the commandements of God is seated in the heart, and more commended for voluntary subiecti|on, then for necessity of abstinence of committing evill, be|cause there is not an instument in the body able to commit transgression.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="151">Finally, by seeking of divinity without the bounds of the holy Scriptures of God, in stead of true divinity, he was entangled with foolish errors: concerning the creation of many worlds, one succeeding to another: concerning the paines of divels and wicked men, after long torments to be finished: and concerning the possibility of nature to keepe the whole law of God. For which opinions, long after his death he was excommunicate in the fift generall Councell, holden <HI>Anno,</HI> 551.

<P><HI>Cyprian</HI> was an African, borne in Carthage, in his youth altogether given to the studie and practice of Magicall arts. His conversion was by the meanes of <HI>Cecilius,</HI> a Preacher, whose name after hee bare, and through occasion of hearing the history of the prophet <HI>Ionah.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ierom. catul. script. eccles. &amp; coment in Iona.

<P>This <HI>Cyprian</HI> Bishop of Carthage, was a man full of loue, a great comforter of <HI>Cornelius,</HI> Bishop of Rome. He suffe|red martyrdome, as <HI>Ierom</HI> writeth, that same day, albeit not in the same yeere,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ierom. catal. script. eccles.</HI></NOTE> that <HI>Cornelius</HI> concluded his life by glo|rious martyrdome. Hee had great strife against two contra|rie Sects, <HI>viz.</HI> againsh <HI>Novatus,</HI> who was excessiue rigorous against those who had fallen in time of persecution: and against <HI>Novatia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">us</HI> and <HI>Felicissimus,</HI> who by the contrary would haue had both Heretiques and Apostates received without all forme of Ecclesiasticall discipline.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hist.

<P>His opinion concerning rebaptizing such as were bap|tized by Heretiques, albeit it was erronius, yet his modesty in not damning them rashly, who were of a contrary opini|on, is greatly praised by Saint <HI>Austen,</HI> who saith that the modestie of <HI>Cyprian</HI> in his error, was more to be regarded, then a sound and right opinion concerning baptisme, with|out humility and modesty.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Aug. de Baptis. contra Donat. lib.</HI> 5. <HI>cap.</HI> 17.</NOTE> Hee was a faithfull builder of the house of God, not by word onely, but also by writing, and his bookes remaine to this day, as a precious treasure in the Church of Christ. The booke <HI>de Revelatione capitis Iohannis Baptisiae,</HI> is supposititious, because in it mention is made of the reverence that <HI>Pipinus</HI> King of France did to the head of <HI>Iohn Baptist,</HI> when it was transported from Constantinople to France; and it is knowne that <HI>Pipinus</HI> was not borne 300. yeeres after the martyrdom of <HI>Cyprian</HI>: how then could <HI>Cyprian</HI> write of a fact done so long time after his death?</P>

<P>The names of the Bishops of Rome, Alexandria, and Antiochia, were the more accurately obserued and registred after the Councell of Nice (albeit I recite them before) because it happened in that generll Councell, that for ti|mous suppressing of heresies, the Bishoppes of these places were called Patriarches, and had power to convocate Coun|cels within their owne bounds, for suppressing of Here|tiques.

This was done in the Councell of Tyrus, to the perpetuall shame of the Arrians, who subborned an harlot to accuse the faithfull servant of Christ without a cause.</P>
<P>Secondly, they accused him for this, that hee had cut off the hand of <HI>Arsenius,</HI> sometime his owne servant: and for greater evidence, they produced in the Councell of Tyrus before the Iudges, the hand of a man inclosed in a case: which hand they affirmed that <HI>Athanasius</HI> had cut off from <HI>Arsenius.</HI> This they spake the more confidently, because they supposed that <HI>Arsenius</HI> remayned still kept in their own custodie:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> but by the providence of God hee escaped, came to Tyrus, and was presented before the Councell, having both his hands perfect, sound, and vnmutilated.

<P>Againe, hee was compelled first to flie, and afterward to lurke in the dayes of <HI>Iulian.</HI> Hee was restored againe by the good Emperour <HI>Iovinian</HI>: and he continued in his ministra|tion vntill the dayes of <HI>Valentinian</HI> and <HI>Valens</HI>:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ruffin. l.</HI> 1. <HI>c.</HI> 34.</NOTE> and although <HI>Valens</HI> was a cruell persecuter, yet hee abstained from perse|cuting of <HI>Athanasius,</HI> for honour of his gray haires, and for that hee was reverently regarded of all men.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sozom. l.</HI> 6. <HI>c.</HI> 19.</NOTE> Thus <HI>Atha|nasius,</HI> full of dayes, died in peace, after he had governed the Church of Alexandria 46. yeeres.</P>

Hee caused them (especially <HI>Ma|carius</HI> and <HI>Isidorus</HI>) to bee transported to an Isle, wherein no Christians were to be found, but onely Pagans, and wor|shippers of divels.</P>

<P>After <HI>Zacharias</HI> succeeded <HI>Stephanus</HI> the second,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Stephanus the second.</HI></NOTE> and ruled fiue yeeres, and one month. In his time <HI>Aistul|phus,</HI> King of Lombardes besieged Rome, at two diuers times, and <HI>Stephanus</HI> implored the aide and assistance of <HI>Pipinus,</HI> King of France, at both times. At the first time <HI>Pipinus</HI> besieged <HI>Aistulphus</HI> in <HI>Papia</HI> the chiefe Citie of residence of the kinges of Lombardes, and compelled him to restore to the chaire of Rome all the townes and lands which by violence hee had taken from them. But at his second comming, he not only relieued Rome from the siege of the Lombardes, but also bestowed vppon the chaire of Rome the dominions of <HI>Rauenna</HI> and <HI>Penta-polis,</HI> appertaining to the Emperour of the East, and which they enjoyed since the death of <HI>Narses,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Platina in vita Step.</HI> 2.</NOTE> 170. yeeres. In so doing, there was such bargaining betwixt the kinges of France and the Popes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 12.</NOTE> as was of olde betwixt <HI>Herod</HI> and the Iewes, he gratified them with the blood of Christes Apostles, and they gratified him on the other part by giuing to him the glory of God: Euen so, <HI>Zacharias,</HI> bishop of Rome,
<PB N="378" REF="197">
bestowed vpon <HI>Pipinus</HI> the kingdome of France, which duly appertained to another: and <HI>Pipinus</HI> againe bestowed vpon the chaire of Rome the dominion of Rauenna, &amp; <HI>Pen|tapolis,</HI> which duely appertained to the Emp. of the East.</P>
<P>It shall not be amisse to make a particular rehearsall of the townes &amp; territories bestowed vpon the church of <HI>Rome,</HI> by the donatio~ of <HI>Pipinus,</HI> but not of <HI>Constantine,</HI> as they haue rumored most fabulously many yeares agoe: In primis, <HI>Ra|uenna, Bononia, Imola, Fauentia, Commaclum, Hadria, Pompilii Forum, Leuii Forum, Cesena, Bobium, Ferraria, Ficoclas,</HI> and <HI>Gabellum</HI>: all these townes were vnder the dominion of <HI>Ra|uenna.</HI> And in <HI>Pentapolis, Ariminum, Pisaurum, Concha, Fa|num, Senogallia, Ancona, Auximum, Hummanam, Aesium, Sempronij Forum, Mons Feretri, Vrbium, Balmense territorium, Callas, Luceolos, Engubium,</HI> together with the Castles and lands appertaining to these townes, to wit, the Prouinces cal|led in our time <HI>Romandiola,</HI> &amp; <HI>Marca Anconitana,</HI> and of olde <HI>Aemilia, Flaminea,</HI> &amp; <HI>Picenu~.</HI> Thus we see what a rich reward the chaire of <HI>Rome</HI> obtained for their defection fro~ the Emp. of the East, and their fauour towards the kings of France. Al|so, for further confirmatio~ of friendship betwixt the bishops of Rome, and the kings of France, Pope <HI>Stephanus</HI> the 2. pro|cured, that he should be inuited to be witnes at the baptisme of the king of Fraunce his yong son, at which time, as a man couetous of vaine glorie,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> he suffered, <HI>Pipinus,</HI> &amp; <HI>Charles</HI> his son, to kisse his feet, &amp; to hold his stirrope, &amp; to lead his horse by the brible: and finally, he was content to be mounted vp, and carried vpon the shoulders of men, leauing behind him an example of stinking pride to the posterity after follow|ing.</P>

<P>To him succeeded <HI>Anastatius,</HI> who albeit hee disliked Images, yet hee was vnthankfull to the Emperour, and fa|voured the seditious attempts of the people of Constanti|nople, who advanced <HI>Artabasdus</HI> to the Imperiall dignity. Moreover, hee slandered the Emperour, as if hee had spo|ken against the divinity of Christ. Hee received a iust re|compence of his vnthankefulnesse: for he was deposed, and scourged, and set vpon an Asse, with his face towards the Asses tayle, and made a ridiculous spectacle to the people.</P>
<P>After him, <HI>Constantine</HI> a Monke, was made Patriarch, who at the first seemed to condemne Images: but afterward hee was found to bee a maintayner and allower of them. The Emperour banished him to Iberia, where hee spake contu|meliously both of the Emperour, and of the Councell holden at Constantinople: therefore he was brought back againe from banishment, and was beheaded, and his body was drawn through the town with a cord, and cast into a pit, where the bodies of malefactors were accustomed to be cast.</P>

<P>IN this declining age, wherein spirituall grace dayly decay|ed, and nothing increased, except an heap of earthly trea|sures, which God permitteth to be poured into the bosomes of them who loue the wages of iniquity.

be the Popes Legate in England, Germany and France, and afterwards to be Archbishop of Mentz. All his studies and travailes tended to this, to bring the people of England, Ger|many, and France, to the subiection of the Romane Bishop, and to a conformity of the superstitions of the Romane Church. In the name, and at the commandement of Pope <HI>Zacharias,</HI> hee disauthorized <HI>Childericus</HI> King of France, thrust him into a Monasterie, and anoynted <HI>Pipinus</HI> the son of <HI>Carolus Martellus,</HI> to be King of France.

He perfected that worke which his predecessours had beene busied in bringing to passe many yeeres preceding: namely, That the Clergie and people of Rome should not attend vpon the allowance of the Emperour, but they should freely choose whom they thought meetest to bee Pope. Hee tooke the greater bold|nesse to doe this, because the Emperour <HI>Carolus</HI> was occu|pied in warre-fare.

<P>Neuerthelesse, the faction of his competitor, <HI>Sergius,</HI> cea|sed not to vexe and molest <HI>Formosus</HI>: so that hee sent secret aduertiseme~t vnto <HI>Arnulphus,</HI> the Nephew of <HI>Carolus Crassus</HI> to come to Rome: who came with an Armie, and was crowned Emperour by <HI>Formosus,</HI> as hath beene alreadie declared.</P>

In speciall, hee condemned the worshipping of the crosse: affirming, that if it should be worshipped, because Iesus died vpon it: then the Ship, in the which Christ sayled, the Asse, where|upon Christ did ride into Ierusalem, &amp; infinit things, which Christ touched, by the like reason, ought also to bee wor|shipped.

<P>And first, for the abolishing of the marriage of Priests, hee sent strict commandement to the Bishops of France and Germany, and other places, that they should depose married Priests from their offices, vnder paine of cursing, and that they should accept no persons in their places, but those who

would binde themselues by a solemne oath, to perpetuall continencie. The Priests made greater reluctation to the Popes commandement, then the Bishops did; in so much that in the Councell of Mentz, convocated by the Archbi|shop for obeying of the Popes commandement: the Arch|bishop accompanied with the Popes Ambassadour, could finde no other meanes to saue their liues, but onely by fly|ing from the incensed wrath of marryed Priests. As concer|ning his other enterprise, in extirping the heresie of Simony (as hee called it) that no Prelat should receiue investment from Emperours and Princes, but onely from the Bishop of Rome.

<P>In his time the Bishop of Florence taught, that Anti|christ was already borne and manifested to the world. Vpon which occasion <HI>Paschalis</HI> assembled a Councell at Florence, and with terrible threatnings put him to silence, and dam|ned his bookes. Also hee assembled another Councell at Tretas, a famous towne in Campanie in France, where hee ratified the decrees of his Predecessors, in condemning the mariage of Priests, as the heresie of the Nicolaitans, and re|ceiving Ecclesiasticall rents from Lay persons, as Simonie. Of his revocation of the priviledge of investment of Bi|shops, granted to the Emperour <HI>Henry</HI> the fift: I haue spo|ken already in the historie of the life of the Emperour.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gelasius</HI> 2.</NOTE>To him succeeded <HI>Gelasius</HI> the second, and ruled one yeere and fiue dayes. He was elected without consent of the Emp. <HI>Henry</HI> 5. which procured vnto him great griefe. For <HI>Cincius</HI> a noble man of Rome, of the family of <HI>Frangepanis,</HI> invaded the Pope and Cardinals, and trod the Pope vnder foot, and cast him in prison and bonds, but the citizens of Rome relieved him, and threatned to destroy the familie of <HI>Frangepanis,</HI> if they set not the Pope at liberty. After this trouble, another followed; the Emperour sent an army to Rome, and authorized another to be pope: whom they cal|led <HI>Gregorius</HI> the eight. The Pope fled to Caieta, the place of his nativity: but when the army returned to Germany, hee came to Rome, where hee found his estate to be ieoper|dous.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Calixtus</HI> 2.</NOTE>After <HI>Gelasius</HI> succeeded <HI>Calixtus</HI> the second, sometime Bishop of Vier, and kinsman to the King of France, he go|verned fiue yeeres, ten moneths, and thirteene dayes.

Also hee compelled the foresayd Emperour
<PB N="419" REF="217" MS="y">
to ouergiue all right, which hee claimed to investment of Bishops, and election of Popes: so much did the Roman Antichrist prevaile by the thunder bolts of his curses, that hee compelled the Emperour by these means to stoupe vn|der his feete. Also he besiedged Sutrium a Towne of the Romans, wherein <HI>Mauritius Burdinus</HI> his Competitor had his remaining. Hee tooke the Towne, and his Compe|titor hee carried Captiue to Rome: setting him vpon a Camel, with his face toward the hinder-parts thereof, and in the end thrust him into a Monasterie. He assembled a Councell at Rhemes, wherein he renewed the ordinance against married Priests, ordaining that not onely they should be spoyled of their liuings and offices, but also that they should be debarred from the communion of Christian peo|ple. Like as these verses doe testifie.</P>

<P>Also hee held another Councell at Rome, where it was statute and ordained that it should not be lawfull to the people to repudiat their Bishop, or to choose another during his life-time:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 7.</NOTE> grounding their ordinance vpon a place of Scripture, a wife is bound to the law of her hus|band, so long as her husband is aliue.

In his time <HI>Arnulphus,</HI> an eloquent man, &amp; a famous Preacher came to Rome: whether out of the wildernesse, or out of any other place wherein he had exercised a ministeriall office it is vncertaine, alwayes it is thought of all men that he was sent of God: hee sharpely re|buked the dissolute Loosnesse, incontinencie, auarice, and pride of the clergie of Rome; so that hee incenced their

hearts against him, speciallie for this, that hee said it was no wonder,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> that they sought his life, for if Saint <HI>Peter</HI> him|selfe were aliue and did rebuke the lewdnesse of their conversation, they would not spare to take Saint <HI>Peters</HI> life also.</P>
<P>Moreouer hee sayd they were full of vncleannesse, and were blinde guides leading the people headlong to Hell: but the Lord would haue in remembrance their iniquities, and call their wickednesse to account. Thus the hatefull indignation of the Clergie being kindled against him for preaching the truth, they layed waite for him secretlie, and tooke him and drowned him.</P>
<P><HI>Platina</HI> alledgeth that this fact displeased the Pope: alwayes there was no inquisition to know the authors of this fact, not punishment of malefactours who shed innocent blood in secret, that manifested vnto the world the Popes indignati|on. About this time was a booke written called <HI>Opus Tri|partitum</HI> the author whereof was vnknowne, but it is sup|posed to haue beene compiled by <HI>Arnulphus.</HI> It contai|ned great complaints of the manifold abuses of Church|men.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Innocentius</HI> 2.</NOTE>After <HI>Honorius</HI> succeeded <HI>Innocentius</HI> the second, and ru|led fourteene yeeres, seuen months, eight dayes.

But <HI>William</HI> Duke of Ca|labria <HI>Rogerius</HI> his sonne, not onely relieued his father, but also laid hands on the Pope and his Cardinals and made them Captiues and prisoners. <HI>Rogerius</HI> delt friendly with the Pope and his Card<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nals and set them at libertie, and ob|tained at the Popes hand whatsoeuer hee pleased, except the name and title of a king. At this time when the Pope was busied in warrefare, the Romans advanced one called <HI>Peter</HI> the sonne of <HI>Leo,</HI> a man of noble birth in Rome to be Pope. And when <HI>Innocentius</HI> adressed himselfe to Rome, hee did finde the faction of his Competitor to be strong and mighty therefore he sayled to Pisca, and from thence to Geneua,
<PB N="421" REF="218">
and from thence to France, where hee assembled Coun|cels at Clermont and at Rhemes, and deliuered his Com|petitor to Sathan.

<P>After <HI>Innocentius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Coelestinus</HI> 2.</NOTE> succeeded <HI>Coelestinus</HI> the second. Hee was chosen Pope without the consent of the people, as witnesseth <HI>Onuphrius,</HI> he ended his course in the fift month of his Popedome.</P>

<P>But it came to passe that hee who was desirous to be terrible and awfull to the Romans,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> hee feared them in like manner, that they were conspiring secretlie against his estate. Therefore hee fled to Tybur, and from thence to Fraunce, to leade an armie to the East, for the support of distressed Christians.</P>
<P>But this voiage had no good successe, notwithstanding that the Popes blessing, and <HI>Bernards</HI> Councell (who was Abbot of Clarauall, and much regarded at that time) were both interposed to advance this often reiterated warrefare against the Turks. When the Pope returned from France to

Hee would not goe to the Church of Lateran to be con|secrated, vntill <HI>Arnoldus</HI> Bishop of Brixia, was driuen from the Towne of Rome: because hee had counceled the Romans to claime to the auncient gouernment of their Towne to be guided by consuls and Senators.

<P>IN this age the armie of Christians which went to fight against the Turkes, conquered out of their hands, not onely Ierusalem, but also Antiochia, and the region round about it. Whereupon it followed that the Patriarchs were established of new againe after long intermission in Antio|chia and Ierusalem. Not such as were accustomed to be of olde, hauing equall power with other Patriarchs within their owne bounds, but rather vassals and slaues to the Bishoppes of Rome, as may appeare by the Catalogue following.</P>

<P>This citation <HI>Raymond</HI> Prince of Antiochia compelled him to obey. He was sent backe againe to Antiochia, but the people and Clergie receiued him not. Therefore hee lurked in Monasteries, and in the ende was deposed from his office by a councell assembled in Antiochia.</P>

<P>In this age the Scholastique Doctors began to arise, of whom <HI>Petrus Lombardus</HI> was the first,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lombardus.</HI></NOTE> who afterward was made Bishop of Paris: but I supersede to write of them vn|till the next Centurie.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Arnulphus.</HI></NOTE><HI>Arnulphus</HI> was an eloquent man, and a mighty preacher, who reprooved the Clergie of Rome, for the lewdnesse of their conversation. Wherefore the Clergie hated him, and drowned him secretly in the night time, as hath been decla|red in the historie of the life of <HI>Honorius</HI> the second. At this time was set forth a booke called <HI>Opus Tripartitum: Ar|nulphus</HI> was supposed to bee the Author thereof. It contai|ned an heavie complaint of the enormities and abuses of the Church, of the number of their holy-dayes, and all lusts of vncleannesse, according to the saying of whores and naughty women, who bragged that they gained more in one day, then in fifty other dayes. Likewise it complai|ned of the curious singing in Cathedrall Churches, where|by
<PB N="429" REF="222">
many are occasioned to spend much time in singing, which might bee better spent in more necessarie sciences. It also complained of the rabble and multitude of begging Fryers, shewing what idlenesse and vncomely behaviour, hath proceeded thereof. Also it toucheth the vnchaste and voluptuous behaviour of Church men, aggravating their faults by the similitude of storks, who are accustomed to beate those storkes out of their number, that having a mate ioyne themselues vnto another:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> What then is to bee done with Church-men, who professing chastity, doe defile other mens houses; so that the stinke of their vncleannesse is knowne to the whole world.

<P>In this age also was <HI>Vualdus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vualdus.</HI></NOTE> a Merchant-man of Lions in France, whom God enlightned with the true knowledge of his word, and remooved from the eyes of his minde the common vaile of ignorance, that overcovered the eyes of the most part of men, who liued at this time: in such sort, that albeit Antichrist was sitting in the chaire of Christ, yet very few either perceived him, or abhorred his tyrannie. This man <HI>Vualdus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> was stirred vp by God after this man|ner. Some of the chiefest heads-men of Lions were wal|king abroad, and it chanced one of them (the rest looking on) to fall downe by sudden death.

<ITEM>1. That onely the holy Scripture is to bee believed, in matters pertaining vnto eternall life, and that it contayneth all things necessary to salvation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That there is onely one Mediator of God and man, the man Christ Iesus: and that Saints <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re not to be invoca|ted as Mediators.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That there is no Purgatorie fire, but all men are either iustified by faith in Christ, or else they are in the state of condemnation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That all masses, namely, such as are sung for the dead are wicked, and to be abrogated.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. That all mens traditions are to be reiected, at least not to be accounted necessary vnto salvation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. That constrained and prefixed fasts bound to dayes and times, difference of meats, such variety of degrees and orders of Priests, Fryers, Monkes, and Nunnes, superfluous holy-dayes, so many sundry benedictions and hallowing of creatures, vowes, peregrinations, with all the rablement of such rites and ceremonies brought in by man, should be a|bolished.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. The supremacie of the Pope, vsurping aboue all Churches, and especially aboue all politique Realmes, and Governments, or for him to vsurpe both the swords, is to be denyed.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. That no degrees are to bee received into the Church, but onely Priests, Deacons, and Bishops.</ITEM>
<ITEM>9. The Communion vnder both kinds to bee necessarie to all people, according to the institution of Christ.</ITEM>
<ITEM>10. That the Church of Rome is Babylon, spoken of in
<PB N="431" REF="223">
the booke of the Revelation, and the Pope the fountaine of errors, and the very Antichrist.</ITEM>
<ITEM>11. The Popes pardons and indulgences to be reiected.</ITEM>
<ITEM>12. The mariage of Priests and men in spirituall offices, they hold to be lawfull and necessary.</ITEM>
<ITEM>13. Such as heare the true Word of God, and beleeue it, are the true Church of God, to whom the keyes belong; to driue away wolfes, to institute true Pastors, to preach the Word, and to administer the Sacraments.
<P>These are the most principall articles of <HI>Vualdenses,</HI> to the which, the rest may be reduced.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>14. Concerning the Supper of the Lord, their faith was, that it was ordayned to be eaten, and not to bee shewed and worshipped; for a memoriall, not for a sacrifice; to serue for the present ministration, not for reservation; to be recei|ved at the table, not to be caryed out of the doores in pomp. And this they proue by an old Chronicle, called <HI>Chronica gestoru~</HI>: and by the testimonie of <HI>Origen,</HI> who writing vpon <HI>Levit.</HI> saith thus. Whosoever receiveth this bread of Christs Supper vpon the second or third day after, his soule shall not be blessed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioshua 9.</NOTE> but polluted.

<P><HI>Bernard,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bernardus.</HI></NOTE> Abbot of Claravall, borne in Burgundie, was respected in his countrey aboue others, who although hee lived in a most corupt age, yet he was found in the doctrine of iustification: as may appeare by the words which hee vt|tered on a time being diseased, after this manner: I grant (saith he) I am vnworthy, and that I cannot obtaine the kingdome of heaven by mine owne merits, neverthelesse, my Lord hath a double right to it: First, by this right, that he is
<PB N="432" REF="224">
his fathers heire. Secondly, by right of the merit of his suf|fering. With the first right,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> he contenteth himselfe. The se|cond he bestoweth on vs, by whose free gift I claime a right thereto, and am not confounded. Hee detested the corrup|tion of manners, which abounded in his time, as may bee knowne by the words of <HI>Hugo Cardinalis.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hugo in postil. super.</HI> 1 <HI>Ioh.</HI></NOTE> It seemeth (saith he) good Iesus, that the whole vniuersitie of Christian peo|ple, haue conspired against thee, and these are the chiefe persecutors, who haue the principall roomes in thy Church. Hee admonished Count <HI>Theobald,</HI> who bestowed great cost in building of Abbies,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> and Churches, that he would rather support them who were of the houshold of faith, and that he would be carefull to build the immortall and everlasting ta|bernacles of God. Hee subdued his body by fasting, be|yond all measure; whereby his stomacke became so disea|sed, that oftentimes it rendered againe the small portion of food which it had received. Hee was very superstitious in receiving the reliques of the Saints. In so much, that when hee came to Rome, and the head of the Martyr <HI>Casarius</HI> was offered to him, to take of it what part hee pleased, hee was content to take one tooth onely. And when his associates could not draw out the tooth (it was so fast fastened vnto the Iawbone) <HI>Bernard</HI> counselled them to pray,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> that the Mar|tyr would willingly conferre vnto them one of his teeth. Many visions and miracles are attributed to him, but they smell so much of superstition, as it is easily knowne, that the most part of them are invented and forged by the deceiving teachers of this age. He died in the 64. yeere of his age, lea|ving them that were about him three testamentall lessons. 1. That they should offend no man.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bernards</HI> testa|mental lessons.</NOTE> 2. That they should giue lesse credite to their owne opinion, then to the iudge|ment of other men. 3. That they should not be vindictiue, nor desirous of revenge for wrongs done vnto themselues. He esteemed much of the prophecies of <HI>Hildegardis,</HI> a Pro|phetesse in France, whose wordes <HI>Bernard</HI> thought to be in|dyted by divine inspiration.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Anselmus Ha|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">elburgensis.</HI></NOTE>In this age also flourished <HI>Anselmus</HI> Bishop of Havelburg,
<PB N="433" REF="224">
whom the Emperour <HI>Lotharius</HI> 2. sent to <HI>Calowannes</HI> Emp. of Constantinople. Hee disputed with <HI>Nichetes</HI> Bishop of Nicomedia,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Anselmus</HI> his disputations a|gainst <HI>Nichetes.</HI></NOTE> in the temple of Sophia, about the old error of the Grecians, who affirmed that the holy Spirit proceeded onely from the Father, and not from the Sonne. Hee refu|ted very learnedly, the obiections of <HI>Nichetes,</HI> who obiected that two fountaines and beginnings were set vp in the God|head, if the holy Spirit proceeded both from the Father and the Sonne. Wherevnto <HI>Anselmus</HI> answered, that when the Councell of Nice sayd,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Deus de Deo, lumen de lumine</HI>: They established not two Gods, nor two lights in the Trinitie. Euen so, when it is sayd, <HI>Principium de principio,</HI> there is not brought in two beginnings, but one only. And whosoever (saith he) denyeth that the holy Spirit proceedeth from the Son,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 17.21.</NOTE> denyeth also that he proceedeth from the Father. For the Scripture saith, I and the Father are one, I am in the Fa|ther, and the Father in me: and againe, Hee that seeth mee seeth the Father.</P>
<P>From this argument they went to another, concerning the supremacie of the Bishop of Rome. <HI>Anselmus</HI> prooved the supremacie of the Bishop of Rome by three arguments. 1. Because the Councell of Nice had preferred the chaire of Rome, to all other chaires, 2. Because Christ assigned superiority to <HI>Peter,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 16.18.19</NOTE> when hee sayd, Thou art <HI>Peter,</HI> and vp|pon this Rocke will I build my Church: and the gates of hell shall not prevaile against it. And I will giue vnto thee the keyes of the kingdome of heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt binde on earth, is bound in heauen, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven. 3. The chaire of Rome was free of heresies, when Constantinople and other Churches of the East were defiled with heresie.</P>
<P>To the first argument <HI>Nichetes</HI> answered, that the Coun|cell of Nice called the Bishop of Rome, the Bishop of the principall chaire, but not the principall Bishop, for that dig|nitie hee received from the Emperour <HI>Phocas,</HI> but not from the Councell of Nice. To the second argument, he answe|red, that the power of binding and loosing was not given
<PB N="434" REF="225">
to <HI>Peter</HI> onely, but also to all the rest of the Apostles. And like as they were all partakers of that same heavenly grace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 2.</NOTE> whereof <HI>Peter</HI> was partaker in the day of Pentecost: so like|wise they all received that selfe same power of binding and loosing. And <HI>Peter</HI> alone received not the power, like as he received not the grace alone. Thirdly, whereas it was al|ledged, that the Romane Church remained vnspotted with heresie, when as other Churches were defiled with it, <HI>Ni|chetes</HI> answered, that it was true, that <HI>Arrius, Macedonius, Nestorius,</HI> and <HI>Eutiches,</HI> did spring vp among the Grecians, and they likewise were chiefly refuted and suppressed by the the Grecians. And the fountaine of all heresies being hu|mane Philosophie, it was no marvell that greatest heresies sprung vp, where men of greatest learning and vnder|standing were found, and it is likely that the fewer heresies sprung vp in the West, because they were men of lesse learning, and not of so deepe vnderstan|ding as the people of the East.</P>

<P>Now in this time of most palpable darkenesse the Lord lacked not witnesses of his truth, but stirred vp many who damned the grosse ignorance and superstition of those times. Of this number was <HI>Arnoldus de Nova Villa</HI> a Spainard,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Arnoldus de noua villa.</HI></NOTE> a man famously learned and a great writer, whom the Pope with his Clergie condemned among Heretikes, for holding &amp; writing against the corrupt errours of the Popish Church.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The articles which he maintained.</NOTE>First, That the faith which then Christian men were com|monly taught, was such a faith as the Deuils had.</P>

He in his time had no small adoe, writing a|gainst the Friers and their Hypocrisie, but especiallie against the begging Friers, both condemning their whole Order and also accusing them as those that did disturbe and trou|ble all the churches of Christ, by their preaching in churches against the will of the Ordinarie Pastors, by their hearing of confessions, and executing the charge of ordinarie prea|chings in their churches. All the testimonies of Scripture that make against the Antichrist, hee applied them against the Clergie of Prelats and the Popes spirituallie.</P>
<P>The same <HI>Guilelmus</HI> is thought to be the author of the booke which is attributed to the schoole of Paris and intitu|led <HI>De Periculis ecclesiae,</HI> where hee prooueth by 39. argu|ments that Friers be false Prophets.

<P>This man (as appeareth by his writings) had diuerse and sundrie visions al tending against the spirituallitie of Rome: for hee called the Pope plainely an Idole, who hauing eyes neither saw nor desired to see the abhominations of his peo|ple nor the excessiue enormitie of their voluptuousnesse, but onely to heape vp treasures to himselfe. And hauing a mouth did not speake himselfe but sayd, I haue set good men ouer them which is sufficient, to doe them good ei|ther by himselfe or others.</P>
<P>Hee notably describeth in one of his visions the curiosi|tie and vanitie of the <HI>Scholastig,</HI> Doctours who flourished in this age, comparing them to a man, who hauing good bread &amp; good wine hanging on both his sides was notwith|standing gnawing hungerly on a flint stone: thereby signifiyng that they leauing the wholsome foode of their soules contained in the Scriptures, busied themselues with subtile questions, containing no edification in them nor comfort to the soule of man.</P>

<P><PB N="446" REF="231">But <HI>Robert Gostred</HI> would not agree to the vngodlie desire of the Pope, but did write backe an answere to him, declaring that next after the sinne of <HI>Lucifer</HI> there is not nor can bee any kinde of sinne so repugnant and con|trarie to the doctrine of the Apostles and holy Scripture, and to our Soueraigue Christ himselfe more hatefull, de|testable, and abhominable, then to destroy and kill mens soules by defrauding them of the misterie of the Pastorall office, which by the ministerie of the Pastorall cure ought to saue and quicken the same. Which sinne by most euident places of Scripture such men are descerned and knowne to commit, who being in the authoritie of that Pastoral dignity doe serue their owne carnall desires with the benefite of the milke and wool of the sheepe and flocke of Christ, and doe not minister the same Pastorall office to the benefite and saluation of those their sheepe. And whereas hee perceiued that the Bishop of Rome delt in all his requests
imperious|lie, rather commaunding, nor requesting any thing to bee done, hee answered in the end of this letter that the pow|er which was giuen by God to any Bishop was to build the house of God, and not to destroy it, hereby blaming the Bishop of Rome, as one who abused his authoritie to the destruction of the Church of God, by placing young boyes in offices neither apt to teach nor wel acquainted with the maners and language of the people.</P>
<P>This ans<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">re being returned to the Pope hee was great|ly moued with indignation, and sware that except hee had beene restrained by his owne naturall clemencie, hee would hurle him downe to such confusion as to make him afable, a gazing stocke, and a wonder to the world.</P>
<P>Not long after thus it pleased God to visit this reue|rend father with sicknesse, in the time whereof hee called to him a Frier of the preaching Order, named Master <HI>Iohn Giles,</HI> a man expert and cunning both in Physicke and Diuinitie, partly to receiue from him some comfort to his body, and partly to conferre with him in spirituall matters. Thus vpon a certaine day the said Bishop con|ferring
<PB N="447" REF="232">
with the said Master <HI>Iohn,</HI> and reciting to him the doings and proceedings of the Pope, did grieuously re|buke his fellow brethren the Preaching Friers, and the other Order also of the Minorites. Because their Order be|ing planted in wilfull pouertie of the Spirit, to the intent they should more freely, carpe and repro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e the vices of the mightie, and not to flatter or to spare them, but sharpely to rebuke and reprehend the same: yet the said Friers contra|rie to their profession did not boldly enough cry out and invey against the abuses of their superiours and men of power, not did vncouer nor detect their faults and wicked|nesse. And therefore the B. said I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">udge them to be no bet|ter than manifest heretickes. And added moreouer (deman|ding of Master <HI>Iohn</HI> what is heresie) that hee would giue him the true definition of it. Whereat when the Frier did stay and pause not remembering the solemne definition of that matter, the Bishop therevpon inferreth, giuing this definition in Latine by the true interpretation of the Greeke word.<NOTE PLACE="marg">What heresie is.</NOTE> <HI>Heresis grac&egrave;, Latine electio, est sententia humano sensu electa scripturae sacrae contraria, palam docta, pertinaciter desensa</HI>; that is, heresie is a sentence taken and chosen of mans owne braine contrarie to holy Scripture, openly maintained and st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">flie defended. And this definition especiallie hee ap|plied against the Romans who commit the charge of soules vnto their kinsfolkes being, both in age vnworthie, and in learning insufficient, and so stiflie defend this their wic|ked opinion that if any dare presume to withstand the same, hee is suspended and excommunicated, and open warre proclaimed against him.</P>
<P>Therefore hee to whom the whole definition of an he|retike doth agree, hee is a verie heretike. And euery Chri|stian man ought to set himselfe against an heretike as farre as hee may yea and that person who can resist him, and doth it not, hee sinneth, and seemeth to be a fauourer there|of according to the saying of <HI>Gregorie.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> Hee lacketh not conscience of secret societie, who ceaseth to resist open impietie, and the Apostle writeth to the Romans, saying

not onely they who commit such things, but also they that consent, are worthie of death. Therefore it may be con|cluded that aswell the Pope (Vnlesse he cease from that vice) as also the same Friers, vnlesse they shew themselues more earnest and studious in repelling the same, are both worthy of death, that is, perpetuall damnation.</P>
<P>Item sayth the Canon Decretall that vpon this vice of heresie the Pope both may and ought to be accused.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He reproueth the enormities of the Church of Rome.</NOTE> After this the vehemencie of his disease more and more increasing and because the nights were somewhat longer, the third night before his departure the Bishop feeling his infirmitie to grow vpon him, willed certaine of his Clergie to be called vnto him, thereby to be refreshed with some conference or communication, vnto whom the Bishop (lamenting in his minde for the losse of soules through the auarice of the Popes court) said on this wise, as by certaine Aphorismes.<MILESTONE N="1"></P>

<P>At this time were three Popes raigning together, by rea|son whereof a generall Councell was ordained and holden at Constance in the yeere of our Lord 1413. And this coun|cell being called by <HI>Sigismund</HI> the Emperour for the taking away of the schismaticall dissention of so many Popes, ruling at one time to the great disturbance of all Christian nations it pleased the said Emperour to send vnto <HI>Iohn Husse,</HI> Bacheler of Diuinitie in the countrie of Bohemia,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iohn Husse</HI> desired to ap|peare before the councell of Constance.</NOTE> his safe conduct, and letters of protection: inviting him to come to the Councell, and promising him a libertie of safe returning vnto his owne country, without any maner of empeachment,

trouble or vexation.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iohn Husse</HI> im|prisoned.</NOTE> Notwithstanding as soone as he came to Constance he was cast into prison before he was heard. And when he was brought forth to the Councell there befell a strange and shamefull matter, for his aduersaries had scar|sly read one article, and brought forth a few witnesses of the same, against him, but as he was about to open his mouth to answere, all that were about him began so to cry out, that he had no leasure to speake a word.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iohn Husse</HI> by reason of the noyse could not be heard.</NOTE> The noise and trouble was so great and vehement, that a man might well haue cal|led it a noyse of wilde beastes &amp; not of men, much lesse was it like a congregation of men gathered together to iudge and determine so graue and weightie matters.

<P>The day after which was the eight of Iune, he was brought out againe to the same place, and in his presence there were read thirtie nine Articles, the which they said were drawne out of his bookes, which were iudged by the councell to be hereticall, and hee of new againe was required by the Em|perour to submit himselfe to the councell.</P>
<P><HI>Iohn Husse</HI> answered that hee would not maintaine any opinion with obstinate minde, but if the Councell would instruct him clearlie that any of his Articles were repug|nant to the holy scriptures of God, he would renounce and forsake the same, affirming also most constantlie that the most part of all those thinges that were alledged against him were falsly forged, and neuer thought nor vttered by him: when they saw that by no exhortation <HI>Iohn Husse</HI> could be moued to acknowledge his doctrine to be erro~eous, &amp; to recant the same, vpon the sixt day of Iulie he was brought to the head church of the citie of Constance, &amp; there in presence of the Emperour and councell was degraded of all Priestly orders and dignities, and a definitiue sentence was giuen out against him wherein hee was condemned as an heretike, for that hee
<PB N="475" REF="245">
preached and openly defended the articles of <HI>Iohn Wickliffe</HI> which were condemned by the Church of Rome, and like|wise had appealed to the Lord Iesus Christ, as the most high Iudge, which appellation they counted a great con|tempt of the Apostolique Sea, and the Ecclesiasticall Cen|sures and Keyes.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iohn Hus</HI> con|demned to be burnt as an Heretique.</NOTE> After this hee was put into the Secular Iudges hands to be burnt as an Heretique, having vpon his head a crowne of paper, with vgly pictures of divels pain|ted thereupon. Which rebuke, as also the torment of fire, hee most patiently sustained, with Psalmes and spirituall Songs, lauding God vntill the winde droue the fire vpon his face, and choaked his breath. And after his bodie was consumed with fire, they cast the ashes of the burnt body into the river of Rhene. Thus died <HI>Iohn Hus</HI> the faithfull Martyr of God, the sixt of Iuly, 1516. Now while as <HI>Iohn Hus</HI> had beene lying in prison, and so hardly handled, his faithfull companion <HI>Ierom</HI> of Prague, came to <HI>Constance</HI> the fourth day of Aprill <HI>anno</HI> 1415. who there perceiving that <HI>Iohn Hus</HI> was denyed to be heard, and that watch was layed for him on every side, hee departed to Iberling a Citie of the Empire, a mile distant from Constance, and from thence caused a letter to be directed to the Councell,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ierome</HI> of Prague writeth to the Coun|cell.</NOTE> and to bee af|fixed vpon the doores of the chiefe Churches, Cloysters, and Cardinalls houses in Constance, bearing in effect that hee was ready to come to the Councell, and to answer vnto any of his accusers, who would stand vp to accuse him of erro|neous and hereticall doctrine, providing alwayes that hee might haue sure and safe accesse. But when hee saw that through such intimations, being set vp, as is before sayd, hee could haue no safe conduct, hee thought meete to re|turne backe againe to Bohemia, taking with him the letters patents of the Lords of Bohemia that were at Constan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, for a testimonie and witnesse of the premises. As hee was in his iourney, by treason and conspiracie of his enemies, hee was taken in Hirsaw by the officers of Duke <HI>Iohn,</HI> and sent backe to the Councell,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ierom</HI> impriso|ned by the Councell.</NOTE> bound with chaines, where hee was cast into prison, and so hardly vsed, that hee fell sore sicke
<PB N="476" REF="246">
almost to the death. But after he was recovered, and <HI>Iohn Hus</HI> was already put to death, they brought forth Master <HI>Ierome,</HI> whom they had long kept in chaines in the Church of Saint <HI>Paul,</HI> and threatning him with death, being instant vpon him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Recanteth, be|ing compelled thereunto.</NOTE> they forced him to abiure and recant, and con|sent vnto the death of Master <HI>Iohn Hus,</HI> that hee was iustly condemned and put to death by them. Neverthelesse, his enemies perceiving that this abiuration was not made sincerely from his heart, but onely for feare to escape their hands, they gaue in new accusations against him. And in the yeere of our Lord, 1416. the 25. day of May, the sayd Master <HI>Iereme</HI> was brought forth vnto open audience be|fore the whole generall Councell, vnto the great cathedrall Church of Constance. Where many things were layd to his charge that day, as likewise the third day after (which was another Diet assigned to him for answering) where hee refuted his adversaries with such eloquence and wisdome, that the hearts of all the Fathers of the councell were mar|velously bent and mooved to mercy toward him. But in the end hee entered to the praise of <HI>Iohn Hus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">He maintai|neth the doc|trin of <HI>Wickliffe</HI> and <HI>Hus.</HI></NOTE> and affirmed that whatsoever <HI>Iohn Hus</HI> and <HI>Wickliffe,</HI> had holden and written specially against the pompe and pride of the Clergie, hee would affirme even to the death. And likewise hee added, that of all the sinnes that ever hee had committed, the sinne of his recantation did most grievously gnaw and trouble his conscience, especially in consenting to the wicked con|demnation of that good and holy man, <HI>Iohn Hus,</HI> which fault as hee did it through weakenesse of faith, and feare of death; so did hee vtterly deny and revoke that wicked re|cantation.</P>
<P>After this, hee was led away againe to prison: and the Saturday before the ascention day, hee was brought to the Cathedral Church before the Congregation, where the sen|tence of his condemnation was given out against him, and a paper with pictures of red divels was brought to bee put vpon his head, which hee himselfe receiving, put it there|upon, saying; Our Lord Iesus Christ when hee suffered
<PB N="477" REF="246">
death for me, most wretched sinner, did weare a crowne of thornes vpon his head,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> and I for his sake will willingly weare this miter, and cap. Afterward hee was layd hold on by the secular power,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ierom</HI> of Prague con|demned and burnt</NOTE> and carried to the place of execution, where his body was burnt with fire, which paine he suffered, with a lowd voyce praising God in the midst of the fire, and commending his soule to the gracious custodie of the Lord Iesus. And finally, his ashes were diligently collected, and throwne into the river of Rhene.</P>
<P>In this age also was <HI>Hieronimus Savonarola</HI> a man,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hieronymus Savonarola,</HI> preacheth a+gainst the evill life of the Spi|ritualty.</NOTE> no lesse godly in heart, then constant in profession, who being a Monke in Italy, and very learned, preached against the evill life of the Spiritualty, and specially of his owne order. Which thing the Pope perceiving, and fearing that the said <HI>Hierom</HI> (who was already in great reputation amongst all men) should diminish and overthrow his authority: he or|dained his Vicar or Provinciall to see reformation in those matters, who with great superstition began to reforme them: But the sayd <HI>Hierom</HI> did alwaies withstand him, whereupon hee was complained of to the Pope, and cursed by him. Notwithstanding hee continued preaching in the towne of Florence. And albeit hee was cited to appeare be|fore the Pope, he made his excuse, and came not. Then was hee againe forbidden to preach, and his doctrine pronoun|ced and condemned as pernicious,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hironimus</HI> si|lenced by the Pope.</NOTE> false, and seditious. Thus <HI>Hieronimus</HI> forseeing the perils &amp; dangers that might come, for feare left off preaching.</P>
<P>But when the people which sore hungred for the word of God, were instant vpon him that hee would preach a|gaine: hee began againe to preach in the yeere 1496. and albeit many counselled him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He againe preacheth.</NOTE> that he should not so doe with|out the Popes commandement, yet did he not regard them, but constantly went forward of his owne good will. When the Pope and his shavelings heard newes of this, they were grievously inflamed and incensed against him, and now a|gaine cursed him as an obstinate and stifnecked heretique.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is cursed by the Pope as an heretique.</NOTE> Notwithstanding all this, <HI>Hierom</HI> proceeded in preaching
<PB N="478" REF="247">
and instructing the people, saying, men ought not to regard such curses as are against the true and common profit of the people.</P>
<P>In all his teaching he desired to teach none other thing, but the onely pure and simple word of God: making often protestation, that all men should certifie him if they had heard him teach or preach any thing contrary thereunto. For in his owne conscience,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> he knew that he had not taught any thing but the pure Word of God. What his doctrine was, all men may iudge by his bookes which hee hath writ|ten. After this, in the yeere of our Lord, 1498. hee was ta|ken and brought to Saint <HI>Markes</HI> Cloyster, and and two o|ther Fryers with him, named <HI>Dominicke</HI> and <HI>Sylvester,</HI> who favoured his learning, and were carryed to prison, and from thence were brought forth by the chiefe Councellors of Florence, and the Popes Commissioners, who had gathe|red out certain articles against them, whereupon they should be condemned to death, which were these:</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The first article was, as touching our free iustification through faith in Christ.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the Communion ought to bee ministred vnder both kinds.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That the Indulgences and Pardons of the Pope, were of none effect.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. For preaching against the filthy and wicked living of the Cardinals and Spiritualty.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. For denying the Popes supremacy.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. And that hee had affirmed that the Keyes were not gi|ven to <HI>Peter</HI> alone, but vnto the vniversall Church.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. That the Pope did neither follow the life nor the doc|trine of Christ, for that hee did attribute more to his owne pardons and traditions, then to Christs merits, and therfore he was Antichrist.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. That the Popes excommunications are not to be fea|red, and that hee who doth feare or flie them, is excommu|nicate of God.</ITEM>
<ITEM>9. That the auricular confession is not necessary.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="479" REF="247">10. That hee had mooved the Citizens to vprore and sedition.</ITEM>
<ITEM>11. That hee had neglected and contemned the Popes citation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>12. That he had shamefully slandred and spoken against the Pope.</ITEM>
<ITEM>13. That he had taken Christ to witnesse, of his naughti|nesse and heresie.</ITEM>
<ITEM>14. That Italy must be cleansed through Gods scourg, for the manifold wickednesse of the Princes and Clergie.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>These and such like articles were layd to their charge and reade before them. Then they demanded of the said <HI>Hierom</HI> and his companions, whether they would recant, and giue over their opinions. Whereunto they answered, that tho|row Gods help, they would stedfastly continue in the mani|fest truth, and not depart from the same. Then were they degraded, one after another, by the Bishop of Wasson, and so delivered to the secular rulers of Florence, with strict com|mandement to carry them forth, and handle them as obsti|nate and stifnecked Heretiques.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hieronymus</HI> with two o|thers, hangd &amp; burnt as here|tiques.</NOTE> Thus was that worthy wit|nesse of Christ, with the other two aforesayd, first hanged vp openly in the market place, and afterward burnt to ashes, and the ashes gathered vp, and cast into the river of Arum, the 24. day of May, 1499.</P>
<P>In this age likewise,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lauren, Valla. Picus Miran|dula Comes.

<P>The meane whereby learning so exceedingly increased in this age, seemeth to bee the Art of printing, found out in Germany by a certaine Gold smith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The invention of printing.</NOTE> named <HI>Iohn Faustus,</HI> in Strausbrugh, and <HI>Guttemberg</HI> his copartner, as some write: but whosoever was the inventer of it, it is certaine that this faculty was given to the vse of man by the providence of almighty God, at what time the Bishop of Rome, with all the whole and full consent of all the Cardinals, Patriarchs, Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors, Lawyers, Doctors,

So that by this meanes of printing, God hath heaped vpon the proud kingdome of Antichrist, a double confusion.

Now of late dayes God hath found a way by this faculty of printing, not onely to confound his life and conversation (which before hee could not abide to be touched) but also to cast downe the foundation of his standing, that is, to examine, confute, and detect his doc|trine, lawes, and institutions, in such sort, that albeit his life were never so pure, yet his doctrine standing as it doth, no man is so blinde, but may see the Pope to be Anti-Christ. For by this Art, Tongues are knowne, knowledge groweth, iudgement increaseth, bookes are dispersed, the Scripture is seene, the Doctors are read, the stories bee ope|ned, times compared,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> truth decerned, falshood detected, and with the finger pointed at, and all (as I haue said) God hath wrought by the benefit of printing.</P>

<P>_AFter <HI>Paulus</HI> the second,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sixtus</HI> 4.</NOTE> succeeded <HI>Sixtus</HI> the fourth, and ruled thirteen yeeres, and foure dayes. Hee changed the custome of keeping the Iubilie every 50. yeere, and would haue it kept every 25. yeeres.</P>
<P>After him succeeded <HI>Innocentius</HI> the eight,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Innocentius</HI> 8.</NOTE> and ruled seven yeers, ten months, and twenty seven dayes.</P>
<P>After him <HI>Alexander</HI> the sixt,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Alexander</HI> 6.</NOTE> ruled eleven yeeres, and eight dayes. Hee was a notable tyrant, and a scourg of God to all Italy, and in speciall to that corrupt Colledge of Car|dinals, which had chosen him to be Pope; not for his good graces and vertues, but for the heapes of gold which hee had distributed amongst them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> of whom some he banished, others hee caused to be impoysoned, and cruelly slaine.</P>
<P>In his time <HI>Charles</HI> the eight, King of France, clayming right to the Kingdome of Naples, entred into Italy with a mighty army, and without great resistance, came to the towne of Rome, and from thence to Naples. <HI>Alphonsus</HI> King of Naples, at this time finding himselfe to be hated of all men, had denuded himselfe of the Kingdome, and given it to his sonne <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> and hee himselfe was fled into Si|cilie. Also his sonne <HI>Ferdinand</HI> not being able to resist the puissant army of King <HI>Charles,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Charles</HI> King of France con|quereth the Kingdome of Naples.</NOTE> was likewise compelled to flie to the little Island of Istria, for safety of his life: and the whole kingdome of Naples was in short time ouer-run, and subdued to the King of France.</P>
<P><PB N="482" REF="249">This victorious conquest so hastily atchieved, made the name of <HI>Charles</HI> to be terrible to other Princes, even to the Duke of Millan, and Estate of Venice, who had beene his confederate friends, &amp; assisters in this warfare. Notwithstan|ding, fearing lest his increasing power should in time be the overthrow of their Estates, they conspired with the Pope, and the Emperour, and the King of Spaine against him: and as hee returned backe againe to France, fought against him at Fornovo, not farre distant from the towne of Parma. The victory was vncertaine: notwithstanding <HI>Ferdinand</HI> King of Naples,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ferdinand</HI> re|couereth the kingdome of Naples.</NOTE> was so encouraged with this encounter, that hee recovered againe all his kingdome which hee had lost.</P>
<P>Likewise in this Popes time, <HI>Lewis</HI> the twelfth, who suc|ceeded to <HI>Charles</HI> the eight, came into Italy, claiming right not onely to the kingdome of Naples, but also to the Duke|dome of Millan. He had before bound vp a covenant with the Pope, the King of Spaine, and the Venetians vpon these conditions that having possessed himselfe first in the Duke|dome of Millan,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lewis</HI> King of France, obtai|neth the duke|dome of Millan.</NOTE> hee should give Cremona a famous towne in the Dukedome of Millan, to the Venetians: and hee should assist <HI>Caesar Borgia</HI> Duke of Valentinois, and sonne to Pope Alexander the sixt, to eiect out of Romagna the Lords presently bearing sway in that Countrey; to the end, that all might come vnder the Soveraignty and commandement of this Duke of Valentinois only: and finally, that he should divide the Kingdome of Naples, betwixt himselfe and <HI>Fer|dinand</HI> King of Spaine. Vpon these conditions, was King <HI>Lewis</HI> assisted by the Pope, the King of Spaine, and the E|state of Venice; and so with little adoe obtained the Duke|dome of Millan, and carryed away <HI>Lodovick Sforce</HI> Duke of Millan, with his brother <HI>Askanius,</HI> captiues and prisoners to France.</P>
<P>This Pope as hee was fraughted with many great faults in his owne person,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Alexander</HI> the sixt, a favourer of his chil|drens vices.</NOTE> so is he likewise noted to haue beene a fosterer of the wicked vices and villanous behaviour of his children: namely, of <HI>Caesar Borgia</HI> his sonne, who not only
<PB N="483" REF="249">
cast off his Religious apparrell, and became of a Cardi|nall a Duke and warriour, but also most vnnaturally slew his owne elder brother Duke of Gandia, and became cap|taine and leader of his fathers armie in his brothers place.</P>
<P>Also the vilde conversation of <HI>Lucretia</HI> his Daughter, and her familiar conversation both with her father and brethren, maketh this Pope to be more famous for wic|kednesse then many other.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The iust iudgement of God vpon the Pope in his death.</NOTE> His end in the righteous iudge|ment of God answered well vnto his life, for as hee had de|stroied the liues of many by poyson, so vpon a certaine time through the ouersight of the Butler the empoysoned wine, that was prepared for to destroy the liues of some Cardinals who were bidden to the banquet, was put in the hands of the Pope and his sonne Duke of Valentinois. The Pope immedi|atlie thereafter died, and the Duke although he vsed manie conterpoysons and other remedies, yet fell he into a sharpe and dangerous disease, and carried about all his time the re|membrance of that nights banquet.</P>
<P>To Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> succeeded <HI>Pius</HI> the third,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pius</HI> 3.</NOTE> who imme|diatly after his admission to the Popedom finished his course the 26. day after his inauguration.</P>

<P>But the Pope on the other part to frustrate all the attempts of his adversaries, appointed a generall Councell to be hol|den at Rome in the Church of Lateran, wherein all things that were done in the Councell of Pisa were disanulled and abrogated.

<P>_AS it is the accustomed dealing of Satan, to pervert men by draw|ing them from the simplicity of Gods truth: So it standeth well with the iustice of God, to giue over men to strong delusions, who will not beleeue the truth of God. Therefore in the third head we are to speake of Heretiques, that sprang vp in this age.<NOTE PLACE="marg">What heresie is.</NOTE> Heresie I count to be an opinion repugnant to the grounds of our
<PB N="496" REF="256">
Christian faith, obstinately maintained by those that pro|fesse the name of Christ. As touching them who lead an e|vill life, yea and in effect deny the Sonne of God, by a pro|phane conversation, but maintaine an opinion that it is law|full so to doe, they may be counted Atheists, or carnall Gos|pellers, and not Heretiques.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A difference betwixt carnal Gospellers, In|fidels, weake Christians, &amp; Heretiques.</NOTE> Iewes and Turkes also who deny the divinity of Christ, because they doe not professe the Name of Christ, we call them Infidels, but not Here|tiques. And the Corinthians, who erred in some funda|mentall points of the Christian faith; yet seeing they main|tained not their error with obstinate mindes, but yeelded to the wholesome doctrine of <HI>Paul,</HI> no man doth count the Corinthians Heretiques, but infirme and weake Christians. And the Apostle himselfe writing to them, calleth them Gods building,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 3.9.</NOTE> and Gods husbandry. But when these three things concurre together, that men professe the Name of Christ, and yet they maintaine opinions repugnant to the very grounds of true faith, and will not receiue instruction, but obstinately persevere in their error, they are to be coun|ted Heretiques. Of this number was <HI>Simon Magus</HI> the fa|ther of Heretiques,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Simon Magus.</HI></NOTE> who being confounded in Samaria, by the great power of God which appeared in the Ministery of <HI>Philip,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act 8.</NOTE> and of <HI>Peter</HI>; hee fled from the East to the West, and came to Rome, where hee prevailed so farre, in short time hee was counted a god, and an image was set vp for him, with this superscription, <HI>Simoni deo sancto,</HI> that is, to <HI>Simon</HI> an holy God. Thus the Romanes who, in the dayes of <HI>Ti|berius,</HI> refused to acknowledge the divinity of Christ, in the dayes of <HI>Claudius</HI> they honoured a Sorcerer,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> and a sedu|cing Heretique with divine honours. He taught them who followed him, to fall downe before pictures and images, and in speciall to worship his owne image,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Euseb. lib.</HI> 2. <HI>cap.</HI> 13. <HI>&amp;</HI> 14.</NOTE> and the image of <HI>He|lena,</HI> a certaine woman who accompanied him in his iour|ney form Asia to Rome.</P>
<P>After <HI>Simon</HI> sprang vp another Suppost of Satan, called <HI>Menander,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Menander.</HI></NOTE> like to his master <HI>Simon</HI> in many things; for he was both a Samaritane, and a Sorcerer, but in absurdity of
<PB N="497" REF="256">
monstrous opinions, hee was farre beyond <HI>Simon</HI>: for hee sayd that the world was created by Angels, and that he him|selfe was sent from aboue to saue the world, and by vertue of his Baptisme, men should bee made immortall, euen in this world;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Euseb. l.</HI> 3. <HI>c.</HI> 26.</NOTE> in such sort, that they should neither waxe old, nor taste of death.

<P>In this age also sprang vp <HI>Ebion,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ebion.</HI></NOTE> who denyed the divini|tie of Christ, and sayd hee was onely a man, begotten be|tweene <HI>Ioseph</HI> and <HI>Marie,</HI> and that the observation of <HI>Moses</HI> Law was necessary to eternall life: his followers were called Ebionites, either by the name of their master <HI>Ebion,</HI> or else as <HI>Eusebius</HI> thinketh, for their poore and beggerly opinion they had of Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Euseb. l.</HI> 3. <HI>c.</HI> 27.</NOTE> supposing him only to be a man: for <HI>E|bion</HI> in the Hebrew language, signifieth one that is poore. These Ebionites damne all the Epistles of <HI>Paul,</HI> and count him an Apostate from the law, and they admit no part of the New Testament for Canonicke Scripture, except the Gos|pell of <HI>Matthew.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cerinthus</HI> about the same time was the author of strange revelations,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cerinthus.</HI></NOTE> which hee sayd hee received from the Angels, that after the resurrection from the dead, Christ should haue an earthly kingdome in this world: and that the subiects of Christs kingdome should eate and drinke, and marry, and keepe holy dayes, and offer sacrifices; for hee himselfe was a man given to fleshly lusts, and hee imagined that the plea|sures of Christs kingdome should consist in fulfilling the concupiscence of the flesh.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Euseb. l.</HI> 3. <HI>c.</HI> 18.</NOTE></P>
<P>Likewise in this age sprang vp the errour of the Nico|laitans, vpon this occasion,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nicolaitans Strom.</HI> 3. <HI>act.</HI> 6.</NOTE> as <HI>Clemens Alexandrinus</HI> doth write. One of the Deacons chosen by the Apostles to haue

the oversight of the poore, had a beautifull woman to his wife, and was accused of over much iealousie. To purge him selfe of all suspition of that fault, hee brought his wife into the midst of his brethren, and sayd, he was content that any man should marrie her. Of which words many tooke occasion to liue promiscuously like beasts, no man having his owne proper wife, but making them all common.</P>
<P>Howbeit, <HI>Nicolaus</HI> is sayd to haue lived himselfe in ma|trimoniall chastity,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Euseb. l.</HI> 3. <HI>c.</HI> 29.</NOTE> contenting himselfe with his owne wife alone.

The diuersitie of names wherewith this Heresie was pointed out, clearely de|clares, that the Donatistes wanted not a great number of fa|uorers: for they were called Parmeniani, Rogatistae, Cirtenses, and Maximianistae.

<P>In this Centurie a great number of people, especially of Monkes, favouring the heresie of <HI>Eutyches,</HI> spake against the Councell of Chalcedon: These were called <GAP DESC="foreign">, be|cause they had no principall head,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Acephali.</HI></NOTE> vpon whom they depen|ded, and they were anterior to <HI>Anthimus,</HI> or <HI>Anthimius</HI> Bi|shop of Constantinople, and to <HI>Theodosius</HI> Bishop of Alex|andria, and <HI>Severus</HI> Bishop of Antiochia: therefore they were not called Anthimians, Theodosians, or Severites, but indeed, they might haue beene called Eutychians, but the vulgar name given vnto them, was <GAP DESC="foreign">.</P>
<P>Another branch which sprang vp from the root of <HI>Euty|ches</HI> heresie,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> was the errour of those who supposed that the flesh of Christ was voyd of all kinde of humane infirmitie, expresly contradicting holy Scriptures, which attributeth vnto the body of Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 4.

There were many rancks of persons, who had defiled themselues with Heathe|nicke Idolatrie: such as Libellatici, Thurificati, Sacrificati, and Proditores.

In this Councell it was ordained, that Deacons, who in time of their ordinati|on did protest, that they had not the gift of continency, but were disposed to marrie, if they married, they should re|maine in their Ministerie: but they who in time of impo|sition of hands by their silence had professed continencie,

persons were not permitted to be present at the celebration of divine mysteries. <HI>Ishyras</HI> also, who was the principall forger of all the afore-mentioned calumnies, was found to haue beene tyed to the bed by infirmity, at that time, when <HI>Macarius</HI> was alledged to haue done all these things.

<P>On the other part, the Bishops, whom the Arrians had intruded in the places of the fore-mentioned brethren, they deposed them, and abhorred their memorie: such as <HI>Gre|gorius</HI> in Alexandria, <HI>Basilius</HI> in Ancyra, and <HI>Quintianus</HI> in Gaza: of whom they discerned, that they were not worthy the name of common Christians,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Theod. ibid.</HI></NOTE> much lesse to bee called Bishops: commanding all people to forsake their fellow|shippe, and neither to send letters to them, nor to receiue letters from them.

The opinions of <HI>Pelagius</HI> and <HI>Coelestius,</HI> concer|ning the power of mans nature, not supported by the grace of God, and free-will of man to doe good of it selfe, is so solidly refuted, and that by arguments taken out of holy Scripture onely; that it is to be wished, that other Councels had followed the example of this Councell, wherein <HI>Au|gustine</HI> was President.</P>
<P>The other cause of the meeting of this Councell, was to constitute canons concerning Ecclesiasticall discipline, spe|cially, that no man should make appellation from his owne

The ground of the great controversie betwixt the Bishops of Rome, and the sixt Councell of Carthage, was <HI>Apiarius Presbyter Siccencis,</HI> a wicked man, and iustly ex|communicate, not onely by his owne Bishoppe <HI>Vrbanus,</HI> but also by a Synode of other neere approaching Bishops. Hee appealed to <HI>Zosymus</HI> Bishop of Rome, a Citie of refuge to all villanous men, as appeared by the insolent forme of his cariage, toward his brethren in Africke: for before hee had heard the causes wherefore they had excommunicated this wicked man <HI>Apiarius,</HI> hee absolued him, and admitted him to his communion. Moreover, vnderstanding that a Councell was to be convened in Carthage, hee sent thither Ambassadours to plead the cause of <HI>Apiarius,</HI> to procure the excommunication of <HI>Vrbanus</HI>; and in case this succeeded not, to desire that this question might be remitted to the de|termination of the Romane Bishop, as vndoubted Iudge of appellations, according to an act of the Councell of Nice. The Fathers of the Councell of Carthage answered with great modesty that they knew no such act, to haue beene made in the Councell of Nice. Alwayes time is granted to the Bishop of Rome, to prooue that such right belongeth to him by an act, of the Councell of Nice. <HI>Zosymus</HI> the first alleadger of this false act,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Soc. l.</HI> 7. <HI>c.</HI> 11.</NOTE> continued short time in office: for hee ended his course within the space of one yeere, and few moneths. <HI>Bonifacius</HI> the successor of <HI>Zosymus,</HI> seriously vr|ging the same prerogatiue, to be iudges in all causes of ap|pellation, according to the act of the Councell of Nice. When all the acts were read, both in the Latine and Greeke exemplars, and no such act was found, the Ambassadors
<PB N="575" REF="295">
of <HI>Bonifacius</HI> returned to him with this answer, that the principall Registers ought to bee searched, which were to bee found in Constantinople, Alexandria, and Antiochia: and in the meane time no man should bee challenged for appealing to the Bishoppe of Rome, vntill this questi|on had an end, by viewing of the authentique Registers. <HI>Cyrillus</HI> Bishop of Alexandria, and <HI>Atticus</HI> Bishop of Con|stantinople, sent to the Councell of Carthage, the iust co|pies of the acts of the Councell of Nice: but no such act was found,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Soc. l.</HI> 7.11.</NOTE> as was alledged by <HI>Zosymus</HI> and <HI>Bonifacius</HI>: and by this time <HI>Bonifacius</HI> also ended his life: for hee sate not aboue three yeeres.

Secondly, to declare the effromed peartnesse of Heretiques, when they are met together, all that they doe is ascribed to the holy Spirit: for in their definitiue sentence against <HI>Maximianus,</HI> they bor|row the words of the holy Apostles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 15.</NOTE> <HI>Placuit Spiritui sancto qui in nobis est</HI>: that is, It hath pleased the holy Spirit, who is in vs.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The first Councell of Ephesus gene|rall.</NOTE>IN the eight yeere of the raigne of <HI>Theodosius</HI> the second, was a general Councel assembled in Ephesus, against the Heretique <HI>Nestorius</HI> Bishop of Constantinople, of whom <HI>Socrates</HI> writeth, that the first ground of his heresie was the speeches of a Presbyter in his Church called <HI>Anastatius,</HI> whom hee had in reverent account. This <HI>Anastatius</HI> vpon a time teaching in the Church,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Soc. l.</HI> 7. <HI>c.</HI> 32.</NOTE> sayd, let no man call the Virgin <HI>Marie</HI> the mother of God, whereupon ensued great trouble in the Church, for they were assured of the divini|tie of Christ.

<PB N="577" REF="296">
the question, before <HI>Iohn</HI> Patriarch of Antiochia, and his companie could be present at the Councell. At the first meeting, <HI>Nestorius</HI> being present, in the towne of Ephesus, vtterly spoyled his cause, and added to his former opinion borrowed from <HI>Anastatius,</HI> that they thought it an indignity done to the onely begotten Sonne of God, to speake of <GAP DESC="foreign"> and <GAP DESC="foreign">, and the words <GAP DESC="foreign">,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Acta Synodi Ephesina.</HI></NOTE> were all reproachfull words to be spoken of the Sonne of God, that is, that hee was nourished vpon milke, that he was borne of a maide, that hee was two moneths or three moneths old, all these words hee counted to bee re|proachfull words to be spoken of the Sonne of God. The Fathers of the Councell were all highly offended at these wordes, and warned him to bee personally present at the Councell, but hee refused to appeare, vntill the time that <HI>Iohn</HI> Patriarch of Antiochia, should be present at the Coun|cell. <HI>Cirillus</HI> Bishop of Alexandria, was a man prompt, and forward in all causes, both good and bad, and hee would not linger vntill the comming of <HI>Iohn</HI> Patriarch of Antio|chia, and his company, but forthwith hee caused his books and writings to be examined, wherein it was cleerly found, that hee sayd the Sonne of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> was not God, but onely that God was with him: so hee denyed the per|sonall vnion of the divine and humane Nature. The Fathers of the Councell vpon this ground damned <HI>Nestorius</HI> as an Heretique,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Soc. l.</HI> 7.32.</NOTE> and <HI>Nestorius</HI> on the other part gathered the Bi|shops of his ownefaction, and damned <HI>Cirillus</HI> Bishoppe of Alexandria, and <HI>Memnon</HI> Bishop of Ephesus.</P>
<P>After this, <HI>Iohn</HI> Patriarch of Antiochia came to Ephesus, whose comming rather increased, then diminished the schisme: for hee was so angry against the precipitation and hastinesse of <HI>Cirillus,</HI> that hee would not adioyne himselfe to the Councell: hereupon followed mutuall excommu|nications: <HI>Iohn</HI> Patriarch of Antiochia, excommuicated <HI>Cyrillus</HI> and <HI>Memnon</HI>: and they&punc; on the other part excom|municated him, and his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> who came not to the Coun|cell: yet in the mercy of God, this schisme that fell out last

<P><HI>Martianus</HI> entreated all the Fathers of the Councell to thinke that he gaue his presence to the conuention, not for ostentation of his power or vertue, but onely for desire that the true faith should be confirmed and established, and that by his authority all tumults of men disobedient to the Councell, might be repressed.

of three things.

The Councell not onely read his letter accusatorie, but also read all the acts of the second Councell of Ephesus, and heard the reports of Bishops, who were present at the Councell of Brigandrie, and consented against their hearts to the deposition of <HI>Flauianus,</HI> because <HI>Dioscorus</HI> had bands of souldiers sent by <HI>Chrysaphius</HI> in the name of the Emperour <HI>Theodosus</HI> 2. to compell simple men to obey all his desires.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The fift gene|rall Councell holden at Constantino|ple.</NOTE>IN the yeere of our Lord 551. and in the 94. yeere of the raigne of the Emperour <HI>Iustinian,</HI> was a generall Councell assembled at Constantinople. The principall causes of this meeting are expresly set downe by <HI>Euagrius</HI> lib. 4. cap. 38. First in respect of the controuersie betwixt <HI>Eustochius</HI> B. of Ierusalem, and <HI>Theodorus Ascidas</HI> B. of Caesarea Cappadocia: <HI>Eustochius</HI> cast out the Monkes of Nova Laura, who obsti|nately defended the errours of <HI>Origen. Theodorus Ascidas</HI> as|sisted them, and said, that <HI>Eustochius</HI> Bishop of Ierusalem had dealt cruelly, and inhumanely with his brethren; to pacifie this controuersie was this Councell conueened: Also great disputation was in the Church about the bookes of <HI>Origen,</HI> of <HI>Theodorus</HI> Bishop of Mopsuesta, and some writings of <HI>Theodoritus</HI> Bishop of Cyrus, and <HI>Ibas</HI> Bishop of Edessa: this was the second cause of this great conuention to put an ende vnto these contentious disputations. At this time <HI>Menas</HI> was Bishop of Constantinople, but he ended his life in the very time of the generall Councel. The first question mooued in the Councel was this: Whether or no, men who were dead, and had ended their course, might lawfully be cursed and
<PB N="587" REF="301">
excommunicated. To this <HI>Eutychius</HI> (a man before this time of no great account) answered:<NOTE PLACE="marg">2.

The generall conuention tooke this effect, That the writings of <HI>Theodorus</HI> Bishop of Mopsuesta were vtterly condemned, and the replyes of <HI>Theodoretus</HI> to the 12. heades of <HI>Cyrillus,</HI> with the letter of <HI>Ibas</HI> written to <HI>Maris</HI> a Persia~ were damned. Finally the errours of <HI>Origen</HI> were dam|ned, &amp; <HI>Theodorus Ascidas,</HI> together with the Monks of Nova Laura, who defended the errours of <HI>Origen,</HI> all were excom|municated, and the 4. preceeding generall Councels were confirmed with full allowance. The Councell of Mopsuesta immediatly following, tended onely to this, to know when the name of <HI>Theodorus</HI> sometime B. of Mopsuesta a towne of Cilicia, was razed out of the roll called <HI>sacra diptycha.</HI> And the ancients both of Clergie and people, assured the Emperour <HI>Iustinian</HI> that the name of <HI>Theodorus</HI> was razed out of the rol of holy Bishops before their time.</P>

This I write, not to hinder any man from the reading of these Councels also: for some good things are to bee found in them, but to wish that the short time wee haue to liue in this world should not be vnfruit|fully spent.</P>

Session compeared <HI>Cambra</HI> B. of Italica, a towne <MILESTONE N="3"> of the province of Spain, of old called Baetica: he co~plained against one of his Clergie, named <HI>Passandus,</HI> that hee being brought vp fro~ his infancy in the Church of Italica, yet had fled without any iust cause to Corduba. It was ordained, that whosoever fled from his owne Church vnto another, should be sent back againe, and be put into a Monastery, &amp; should be devested of his honor for a time, to the end, that the sharp|nesse of discipline might correct the licentious liberty of vagring and wandering.</P>
<P>In the 4. Session, it was complained, that some were con|secrated <MILESTONE N="4"> to bee Levites in the Church of Astigita, who had
<PB N="598" REF="307">
maried widowes: This ordination was annulled; and it was ordained, that none of these Leuites should be promo|ted to the honor of a Deacon.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="5"> In the 5. Session, a Deacon of the Church of Agabra com|plained of the ordination of three persons in that Church: one was ordained to bee Presbyter, and two to bee Levites. The Bishop being blind, laid his hands vpon them, but one of the Presbyters pronounced the blessing: Now the Pres|byter who had pronounced the blessing, was dead before the Councell of Hispalis, therefore they remitted him to his owne Iudge: but the three persons afore-said admitted to Church-offices, they deposed them from their offices, as persons vnlawfully admitted.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="6"> In the 6. Session, it was found, that <HI>Fragitanus,</HI> a Presby|ter of the Church of Corduba, was most vniustly both de|posed and banished, by his Bishop. For remedy, that the like mis-order should haue no place in time to come, it was statu|ted &amp; ordained, that a Bishop, without advice of his Synode, should not presume to depose a Presbyter.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="7"> In the 7. Session, Chore-episcopi, &amp; Presbyters are debar|red fro~ the high priviledges of the Episcopal office: namely, from the consecration of Presbyters, of holy Virgins, Chur|ches, &amp; Altars, from laying hand vpon men converted from heresie, &amp; conferring vnto them the holy Spirit, fro~ making of Chrisme, &amp; signating with it the fore-heads of them who are baptized, from absolving publickly in time of Masse, any penitent person, and sending testimonials to forraine parts, called <HI>Formatae epistola</HI>: and finally, from baptizing, consecra|ting the Sacrament, blessing the people, and teaching them, receiving penitents, when the Bishop was present.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="8"> The 8. Session intreated concerning <HI>Heliseus,</HI> a servant, whom the Bishop of Agabra had set at liberty, and hee on the other part abused his liberty, so farre, that he presumed by Magicall Art to cut off the Bshoppe who had beene so beneficiall vnto him: he was ordained to be redacted againe to his former servile estate, that hee might learne obedience to his superiours, by the heavie yoke of servile subiection.</P>
<P><PB N="599" REF="307">In the ninth Session, it is forbidden, that Bishops should <MILESTONE N="9"> haue Leke-men to be masters of their house, but onely some of their owne Clergie, should be dispensators of their hous|hold affaires,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 12.10.</NOTE> because it is written, <HI>Thou shalt not plow with an Oxe and an Asse together.</HI> By the way marke, that nothing was so miserably abused at this time, as testimonies of holy Scripture.</P>
<P>In the tenth Session, the Monasteries lately builded in <MILESTONE N="10"> the Baetike Province, were allowed, and confirmed.</P>
<P>In the eleventh Session, the Monasteries of Virgins are re|commended <MILESTONE N="11"> to the over-sight of the Abbot governing the Monastery of Monkes, with caveats, that all appearance of evill should be providently eschewed.</P>
<P>In the twelfth Session, one professing the heresie of <HI>Ace|phali</HI><MILESTONE N="12"> compeared, who denyed the distinction of two natures in Christ, and affirmed, that the divinity of Christ did suf|fer vpon the Crosse: but he was seriously dealt withall, and convicted by testimonies of holy Scripture, and Fathers: so that hee renounced his hereticall opinion, and embraced the true faith; and the whole Councell gaue thankes and praise vnto God, for conuersion.</P>
<P>In the thirteenth Session, there is a prolix refutation of <MILESTONE N="13"> the opinion of those who supposed, that the two natures of Christ were confounded, and that the divinity suffered. <HI>Isi|dorus</HI> seemeth to be the compiler of this Treatise, against <HI>A|cephali,</HI> given into the Councell of Hispalis: and many do thinke,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hist. Magd. cent.</HI> 7. <HI>cap.</HI> 10.</NOTE> that hee collected into one volume the Councels that preceded his time: for he was a man more learned than his fellowes, in his dayes.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Canon 5.</NOTE>Concerning the diuersitie of rites vsed in Baptisme, some vsing the ceremonie of thrise dipping in water, others one dipping only.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Canon 6.</NOTE>It was statuted and ordained, That vpon Fryday immedi|ately preceeding Easter day, the doctrine of the suffering of Christ, of repentance, and remission of sinnes, should be clearely taught vnto the people, to the end, that they being purged by the remission of sins, might the more worthily ce|lebrate the feast of the Lords resurrection, and receiue the ho|lie Sacrament of the Lords bodie and blood.</P>

<P>That the Tapers and Torches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Canon 8.</NOTE> which shined in the church in the night preceeding the day of the resurrection should be solemnly blessed, to the end, that the mystery of the holy re|surrection might be expected with consecrated lights.

In like manner, all were damned who made opposition to the fiue preceding gene|rall Councels. In particular, <HI>Theodorus</HI> of Pharatrita, <HI>Cyrus</HI>

<P>IN the 4 yeere of <HI>Bambas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The 2. Coun|cell of Brac.</NOTE> King of Gothes, eight Bishops were assembled in Braga. In the beginning of the Coun|cell, for confession of their Faith, they made a new rehear|sall of the summe of the Nicene Faith. After this, they set downe eight ordinances, in manner following:</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That all superstitious opinions being reiected, bread and wine mixed with water, onely should be offered in the Sacrifice, and not the liquor of milke, nor pure vnmixed wine, nor bread dipped in wine. Here marke, that the gi|ving of vnmixed wine to the people, in the Sacrament or Sa|crifice, is called superstition: such bitter fruits do ensue vp|on magnifying the traditions of men, that Christs owne in|stitution, is called superstition.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That vessels dedicated to God, bee not abused, and imployed to secular and humane vses.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. A Presbyter, when he sayeth masse, let him bee cloa|thed with his Orarium on both his shoulders, and be signa|ted on his brest, with the signe of the Crosse.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Let no person of the Clergy cohabit with women, no not with their owne sisters, without witnesses of their conversation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Vpon Festivall dayes, reliques enclosed in an Arke, shal be borne vpon the shoulders of the Levites, as the Arke of God in the old Testament was accustomed to bee borne,
<PB N="620" REF="318">
1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 15.15. and not about the necke of a Bishop: and in case the Bishop will needs carry them himselfe, then shall he walke on foot with the rest of the people, and not be car|ryed in a coach by his Deacons. Here marke how mens tra|ditions are equalled to the commandements of God.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. Presbyters, Abbots, and Levites, for the dignity of their calling, shall not bee punished with stripes by the Bi|shoppe, lest in dispersoning the principall members of his owne body, hee bring himselfe into contempt of his sub|iectes.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. Let no honour be sold for promise of rewards.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. Let governours of Churches haue a greater regard to the weale of the Church, then to their owne particular af|faires.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>In the end, thankes is given to God, and the King, for their meeting&punc; &amp; they subscribe the fore named ordinances. Here marke, that in the country of Spain, the King still kee|peth in his owne hand, power of convocating Councels.</P>
<P>IN the yeere of our Lord, 681. and in the 12. yeare of the raigne of <HI>Constantius Pogonatus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The 6. Coun|cell holden at Constantino|ple.</NOTE> a general Councell was assembled at Constantinople, by the authority of the Em|perour, and not by the commandement of Pope <HI>Donus,</HI> nor <HI>Agatho</HI> his successor, nor of <HI>Leo</HI> the 2. the successor of <HI>Aga|tho,</HI> as the Divall letter of <HI>Constantine,</HI> directed to Pope <HI>Do|nus</HI> and received and obeyed by Pope <HI>Agatho,</HI> cleerly testi|fies. As for the number of Bishops convened, there is an in|finite discrepance betwixt the authors, who make rehearsall of their number: the least number reckoned, is 150. The question discussed in this Assembly, was about the wils and actions of Christ. <HI>Macarius</HI> Patriarch of Antiochia, and <HI>Stephanus</HI> his disciple, pertinaciously defended the errour of the Monothelites: confirming also their opinion by the te|stimony of <HI>Honorius,</HI> sometime Bishop of Rome, whose let|ters written to <HI>Sergius,</HI> sometime Bishop of Constantinople, being read in the open audience of the Councell, made it cleerly knowne, that he also was infected with the erour of
<PB N="621" REF="318">
the Monothelites. For this cause <HI>Honorius</HI> Bishop of Rome, <HI>Sergius, Pyrrhus,</HI> and <HI>Paulus</HI> Bishops of Constantinople, <HI>Cyrus</HI> Bishop of Alexandria, and <HI>Macarius</HI> Bishop of Anti|ochia, were all excommunicated: likewise <HI>Polychronius,</HI> a ridiculous Monke, and his complices were exco~municated, and with great shame and ignominy, reiected from the fel|lowship of the Church: For he offered to proue the opi|nion of the Monothelites to bee the truth of God, by wri|ting the summe of that opinion in a paper, and over sprea|ding it vpon a beere, wherein a dead man was laid, hee put the Councell in hope, that hee would raise the dead man to life againe: but after tryall, hee was found to be a lying and a deceitfull fellow, and he likewise was excommunicated.</P>
<P>This Councell made no Canons and Constitutions con|cerning Church-discipline, as other Councels had done be|fore: For this cause <HI>Iustinian</HI> the 2. the son of <HI>Pogenatus,</HI> ga|thered these same Fathers, who had beene in the preceding Councel, to perfect the worke which they had begun.</P>
<P>They made many Constitutions, but two in special, which displeased the Romane Church: First, they annulled the doctrine of the Church of Rome, concerning prohibition of marriage to men in spirituall offices. Secondly, they or|dained the Patriarch of Constantinople, to bee in equall au|thority with the Pope of Rome. These Constitutions and Canons, Pope <HI>Sergius</HI> refused to subscribe, albeit his ambas|sadors in his name had subscribed them in Constantinople.</P>
<P><HI>BAmbas</HI> King of the Goths,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The 12.

Bishops, with some Abbots, and 13. Noble|men of the Court, convened at Toledo. The King, amongst many other things, protested, that he was content, that what|soeuer thing in his lawes seemed repugnant to reason, it should be corrected by the prudent advice of this Councel.</P>
<P>The Fathers of this Councell, for confession of Faith, ad|hered vnto the Councell of Nice. After this, the hand-wri|tings
<PB N="622" REF="319">

So it came to passe, that <HI>Eu|ringius</HI> was solemnly proclaimed to be King, and the people were assoyled from the oath of allegeance made to <HI>Bambas,</HI> and were astricted to the obedience of King <HI>Euringius.</HI></P>
<P>In this Councell it was forbidden, that new Bishoprickes should be erected in villages: and the Bishop of Emerita beg|ged pardon for this, that he had ordayned a Bishop in a cer|taine village, being compelled so to doe, by the commande|ment of King <HI>Bambas.</HI> They who stand at the Altar, and sa|crificeth, are commanded to eate of the sacrifice, as often as they offer it. The acts, made in preceding Councels, against the Iewes, were renewed and amplified in this Councell: and thankes was given to God, and the King, for their mee|ting.</P>

<P>_IN the yeere of our Lord, 712. a Coun|cell was assembled at London,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Councell at London.</NOTE> where <HI>Bo|nifacius</HI> was present, and <HI>Brithuvaldus</HI> the chiefe Prelate of England; and the Kings of Saxons ruling in England, were com|manded vnder pain of cursing, to be pre|sent at this Councell. The purposes in|treated in this Councell were two; to wit, concerning the adoration of Images, and prohibition of marriage to men in spirituall offices. About worshipping of Images no dispu|tation was heard, whether that service did agree with the written word of God, or not. This was counted a sufficient wartant for bringing Images into places of adoration, and for worshipping them (especially the Image of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI>) that <HI>Eguvinus,</HI> a superstitious Monke in England, of the order of Saint <HI>Benet,</HI> who afterwards was made a Bi|shoppe: affirmed that the Virgine <HI>Marie</HI> appeared vnto him in a dreame, and declared, that it was her will, that her Image should bee set vp in the Churches, and worshipped. These dreames once confirmed by the oath of <HI>Eguvinus,</HI> and approoved by <HI>Constantine</HI> Bishop of Rome, and obtru|ded by <HI>Bonifacius</HI> the Popes Legate, they were embraced in England, with little contradiction in such a corrupt time.</P>
<P>The other purpose entreated in this Councell, was pro|hibition of marriage, to men in spirituall offices. This doc|trine of the Romane Church, was not received without re|luctation of the Clergie. Onely, a ground was laid, where|upon followed a building of the doctrine of Divels.</P>
<P><PB N="624" REF="320"><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Councell of Constanti|nople, vnder <HI>Philippicus.</HI></NOTE>ABout the same time, that is, about the yeere of our Lord 712. it is supposed, that the Emperour <HI>Philippicus</HI> ga|thered a Councell at Constantinople, for vndoing of the sixt generall Councell, in the which the errour of the Mo|nothelites was condemned: and that hee did this according to a promise made to a Monke, named <HI>Iohn,</HI> who fore-told him that hee would bee made Emperour, and craved this promise of him, that when hee should bee advanced to the Imperiall dignity, he should vndoe the sixt generall Coun|cell. But the writers of this History doe not make particular mention of the Fathers, who were present at this Councell. The rest of the History is cleere, that <HI>Philippicus</HI> razed the pictures of the Fathers, who had been present at this Coun|cell, and were pictured in the Temple of Sophia: and that on the other part, Pope <HI>Constantine</HI> the first, not onely cau|sed the same effig&iacute;es to bee pictured in the porch of the Church of Saint <HI>Peter</HI> at Rome, but also procured that the Emperours name should be razed out of charters, and that his effigie should not bee ingraved in any kinde of coyned mettall. Also it is cleere, that <HI>Philippicus</HI> remooued <HI>Cyrus</HI> from his office, and placed in his roome <HI>Iohn,</HI> who fore-told him that he should be Emperour.</P>

Here marke the tyranny and fiercenesse of Antichrist, Who gaue such authority to a Roman Preacher, to dismount the Monarches of the world from their royall thrones? Yet <HI>Gregorie</HI> the third attempted such high matters, because the Emperor <HI>Leo</HI> had disallowed the worshipping of Images. Likewise, by his instigation the whole countrey of Italy refused to pay tribute to the Empe|rour. Now is the banner of Antichrist displayed against the Emperour, and this is a fore-running token, of the hatefull enmity which is to ensue betwixt the Popes and the Empe|rours, which (God willing) shall bee declared in its owne time. Likewise, <HI>Anastatius</HI> Patriarch of Constantinople, was condemned and excommunicated in this Councell. To fa|vour the Emperour, and to dislike the worshipping of Ima|ges, were two irremissable sinnes, and meriting the great <HI>A|nathems</HI> of the Bishop of Rome.</P>

Bishops, was assembled at Constantinople, by the commandement of the Emperour. In this Councell the worshipping of Images was damned, and the placing of them in Oratories and Temples, where the divine Maiesty is worshipped, was forbidden, as a custome borrowed from Pagans, who had no hope of the resurrection, and therefore solaced the~selues with pictured similitudes of their friends, as if they had beene bodily present with them. Yea, for three principall causes they damned the worshipping of I|mages: First, because the worshipping of them is repug|nant vnto holy Scripture. Secondly, because the divine and humane nature being vnseparably vnited in Christ, and the divine nature cannot be presented by an Image: therefore it is not meete to represent his humane nature by an I|mage, left we should seeme to separate the two natures in Christ. And thirdly, because the writings of ancient Fa|thers

doe vtterlie condemne the worshipping of Images, such as <HI>Epiphanius, Eusebius, Gregorius Theologus, Athanasius, Amphilochius, Chrysostomus,</HI> and <HI>Theodorus</HI> Bishop of Ancyra. It were a prolixt thing to make a rehearsall of the sentences of all the forenamed Fathers: therefore, for breuities cause, I will heere onely make choise of one place, which is this: <HI>Eusebius Pamphili,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hist.

As concerning His diuine nature, I hope yee are not sollicitous to seeke the image thereof, beeing suffici|entlie instructed, that no man knoweth the Father, except the Sonne, and on the other part, no man knoweth the Sonne, ex|cept the Father. But if yee desire the similitude of mans na|ture, wherewith He clad Himselfe for our sakes, vnderstand, that the splender and shining brightnesse of his glorie cannot be repre|sented with dead coloures, and shaddowed pictures: For euen his Disciples in the mountaine were not able to abide the brightnesse of His shining face</HI> (Mat.

<P>In this Councell <HI>Germanus</HI> Bishop of Constantinople, <HI>Georgius Cyprius,</HI> and <HI>Damascene</HI> a Monke, who were princi|pall defenders of the worshipping of images, were excom|municated.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The second Councell of Nice.</NOTE>IN the yeere of our Lord, 788. and in the eight yeere of the raigne of <HI>Irene,</HI> and her sonne <HI>Constantine,</HI> a Councell was assembled at Nice in Bythania, of three hundreth and fiftie Bishops. The Ambassadours of <HI>Adrian</HI> the first, Bishop of Rome, were present in this Assemblie. <HI>Basilius,</HI> Bishop of Ancyra; <HI>Theodorus,</HI> Bishop of Myra; and <HI>Theodosius,</HI> Bishop of Amorium; offered to the Councell their supplicant letters, confessing, that they had sinned in condemning the wor|shipping of images in the Synode assembled by <HI>Constantinus Copronymus.</HI> These reedes, shaken with the winde, and vn|constant fooles, were accepted in fauour, as a preamble vnto this malignant Councell. The Epistle of <HI>Adrian</HI> Bishop of Rome, was openly read in the Councell, approuing the wor|shipping of images. His letter was full of fables and lies, such as the fable of the leprosie of <HI>Constantine,</HI> and of the shedding of the blood of innocent babes to procure remedie against his sicknesse, and baptisme of <HI>Constantine</HI> by <HI>Syluester,</HI> the miraculous restoring of the Emperour to health after his Baptisme, and of the images of <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> produced to <HI>Constantine</HI> before his baptisme. Such a Legend of lyes no Councell could haue heard read in their audience, if it had not bin a time in the which the mistery of iniquity was effec|tually working: For the history of the life of <HI>Co~stantine,</HI> writ|ten by <HI>Eusebius,</HI> expressely prooueth the contrary: to wit, that <HI>Constantine</HI> was not leprous, but rather a man of a cleane and vnspotted body: and that hee was not baptized by <HI>Syluester</HI> in Rome, but by <HI>Eusebius</HI> in Nicomedia. Notwithstan|ding, the letter of Pope <HI>Adrian</HI> was accepted and allowed by the Councell. And it was ordained, That the image of Christ, of the blessed Virgine <HI>Mary,</HI> and of the Saints, should not onely bee receiued into places of Adoration, but also should bee adored and worshipped: And the honour done to the image, is thought to redound to him (or her) who is present by the image, according to the words of <HI>Basilius

Magnus.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Basil. contra Eunomium,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. 1.</NOTE> But <HI>Basilius Magnus</HI> is writing in that place of Christ, the image of the inuisible God, and not of images made with mens hands.</P>
<P>THe Fathers of this Councell, as it were bewitched by the delusions of the Deuill, were not ashamed to confirme the adoration of images, by lying miracles, and by a foolish confabulation betwixt the Deuill and a Monke, whom Sa|than ceased not to tempt continuallie to the lust of vnclean|nesse, and would make none end of tempting him, except he would promise to desist from worshipping the image of the Virgin <HI>Mary.</HI> But argumentes taken from the fables of Monkes, and delusions of the Deuill, are not to be hearkened vnto, in a matter expressely repugnant to the written word of God.</P>
<P>IN the yeere of our Lord 794.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Councell of Frankford.</NOTE> <HI>Charles</HI> the Great, King of France, assembled a great Councell at Frankford: partlie in regard of the heretike <HI>Foelix,</HI> who called Christ the adoptiue Sonne of God in his humane nature, and was condemned in a Councell assembled at Ratisbona, <HI>Anno.</HI> 742. but hee was returned to his vomite againe: and therefore was of new againe condemned, as a notable he|retike, in the Councell of Frankford: partly also in re|spect of the great disputation that arose euerie where con|cerning the worshipping of images, disallowed in the coun|cell of Constantinople, and allowed in the second Councell of Nice.</P>
<P>Not onely the Bishops of France, but also of Germanie &amp; Lombardie, as Prouinces subdued to the King of France, were present at this Councell. Likewise, Pope <HI>Adrian</HI> sent his Ambassadours, <HI>Theophilactus</HI> &amp; <HI>Stephanus,</HI> to the Coun|cel. And <HI>Charles</HI> himselfe, King of France, was present in the Councel of Frankford. The Ambassadours of Pope <HI>Adrian</HI> produced, the actes of the second Councell of Nice, hoping that the Councell of Frankford should haue giuen consent
<PB N="630" REF="323">
and allowance vnto the same. But the Fathers of this Coun|cell collationed the actes of the Councell of Constantinople, with the actes of the second Councell of Nice. And they disallowed in the Councell of Constantinople the strict prohibition to picture images, either in Temples of other places. And in the second Councell of Nice they dis|allowed the Act of worshipping of images, and of honou|ring them with garments, incense, candles, and kneeling vn|to them: counting the afore-saide Act to be so impious, that the Councell in the which it was concluded, was neither worthy to be called Catholicke nor Oecumenicke. The ar|guments whereby the second Councell of Nice endeuoured to approue the adoration of images, are all refuted in the Councell of Frankford, as I haue declared alreadie in a trea|tise concerning worshipping of Images.</P>
<P>Concerning the argument taken from the authoritie of <HI>Epiphanius,</HI> who in his book called Panarium, reckoneth not the worshippers of images in the roll of Heretikes: it is an|swered by the Councel of Frankford, that in case <HI>Epiphanius</HI> had counted the haters of the worshippers of images, Here|tikes; hee had likewise inserted their names in the catalogue of Heretikes: but seeing he hath not so done, the Councell of Nice had no just cause to triumph so much in this friuo|lous argument, which maketh more against them, than it maketh for them.</P>
<P>More-ouer, in the Councell of Frankford, the Epistle of <HI>Epiphanius,</HI> written to <HI>Ihonne</HI> Bishop of Ierusalem, was read; wherein hee disalloweth the verie bringing in of images into Churches: and this Epistle was trans|lated out of the Greeke into Latine language, by <HI>Ierom.</HI> The Epistle is worthie to be read.

<P>IN the yeere of our Lord 813. a Councell was assembled at Rhemes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The eigth Councel of Rhemes.</NOTE> by the co~mandement of <HI>Charles</HI> the great: for it is to be remarked, that he not only asse~bled that famous Cou~|cell of Frankford, <HI>Anno.</HI> 794. in the which adoration of Ima|ges was condemned: but also, when he was now aged, &amp; saw many abuses in the Church, hee endeuoured by all meanes possible, to procure reformation of the lewd manners of Church-men. Therefore, he appointed, at one time, to wit. <HI>Anno,</HI> 813. fiue National Cou~cels, to be conueened in diuers places, for reformatio~ of the Clergie &amp; people: One was con|ueened at Mentz, as hath bin declared: Another at Rhemes: the third at Towrs: the fourth at Cabilone, or Chalons: &amp; the fift at Arles. In all these Councels no opposition is made to the Councell of Frankford: neither was the adoration of Images auowed in any of these Councels. So much auai|leth the authority of a Prince for suppressing of false doctrin and heresie. In this Councell at Rhemes, <HI>Wulfarius,</HI> Arch|bishop was president. 44. canons are rehearsed in the 2.

<P>In the 1. Can. it was co~cluded, That euery man should dili|ge~tly acquaint himself with the Articles of his faith. 2. That e|uery man shuld learn the Lords Praier, &amp; co~prehe~d the mea|ning thereof. 3. That euery man, promoted to Ecclesiasticall orders, shal walke worthily, co~forme to his calling. 4. The E|pistles of <HI>Paul</HI> were read, to giue instructio~s to sub-deacons, how they shuld behaue the~selues. Yet is there not one word in all the Epistles of <HI>Paul</HI> of a sub-deacon. 5. The Gospell was read to giue instructio~ to Deacons, to minister condingly in their office. 6. Ignorant Priests are instructed to celebrate the Seruice with great vnderstanding. 7. In like manner, they are instructed how to prepare <GAP DESC="foreign"> to the Sacrame~t of Baptisme. 8. The holy Canons were read out of the De|cretall of <HI>Innocentius,</HI> for ordering the life of Chanons. 9. The rule of Saint <HI>Benedict</HI> was read, to reduce Abbots, and their Conuents, to a remembrance of their order. 10. The
<PB N="635" REF="326">
Pastorall booke of <HI>Gregorius</HI> was read, to admonish Pastors of their dutie. 11. Sentences of diuers ancient Fathers were read, to admonish men of all rankes, both Prelates and subiects, to bring forth the fruit of a good conversation. 12. These things being done, they set downe a forme of receiuing of confessions, and prescribing of penance, accor|ding to the Canonicall institutions. 13. They reasoned a|bout the eight principall vices, to the end, their diuersitie being distinguished, every man might know what vices he should eschew, and teach others to beware of the same. 14. That Bishops should take heed of the reading of the bookes of the Canonicke Scripture, and the bookes of Fathers: and should attend vpon the preaching of the Word of God. 15. That Bishops should preach the Sermons and Homi|lies of holy Fathers, in such sort as all the people might vn|derstand them. The 16. Canon is coincident with the 12. 17. That Bishops, and Abbots, permit no man to solace the company with filthy gesting in their presence: but let poore and indigent people be refreshed at their tables with lectures of divine Scripture, and praising of God, accor|ding to the Precept of the Apostle, that <HI>whether wee eate or drinke, let all things be done to the glory of God.</HI> 18. Gluttony and Drunkennesse forbidden to Bishops, and the Ministers of God. 19. Let not Bishops bee rash to iudge in things secret, which are to bee referred to the iudgement of God, who can manifest things hid vp in darknesse, and discouer the secrets of the heart. 20. Presbyters shall not transport themselues from a low place to a greater. 21. Whosoever by paying money, procureth a preferment in the Church, shall be deposed. 22. No Church-man shall cohabite with a woman, except it be with his mother or sister, or such like persons, by whose company no suspition of vncleannesse can arise. Precepts given to Monkes, and Nunnes, I passe by, as I did in the former Councell.</P>
<P>Canon 35. The Sabbath day shall be kept holy, and in it no servile worke shall bee done, according to the Lords commandement. 36. Let no man bestow vpon the Church
<PB N="636" REF="327">
that thing which by vnlawfull meanes hee hath fraudulent|ly with-drawne from others. 37. Nor yet by lies and deceitfull meanes, with-draw any thing duly belonging to the Church. 38. Let tythes be precisely payed. 39. Let no man presume to receiue rewards for his decreet and sen|tence. 40. Let prayers and oblations be made for the Em|perour, and his noble race, that it would please God to pre|serue them in all happines, in this present life, and vouchsafe vnto them celestiall ioyes in company of the Angels, in the life to come. In the 41. Canon, mention is made of a cer|taine rent, left by King <HI>Pipinus</HI> of Good memory; which they wish the Emperour <HI>Charles, Pipinus</HI> sonne, should not alter, nor transferre into another summe, in respect, that by so doing, many periuries and false testimonies might ensue. 42. And that no man should be remoued from his mansi|on, to whom the Emperours almes is distributed. 43. And that the statute may bee confirmed by his Highnesse allow|ance, whereby all contentions and strifes are ordained to haue a decision, and end. 44. And that the statute made in Bononia, concerning false witnesses, may be ratified and confirmed: with augmentation, if neede require, for es|chewing of periuries, false testimonies, and many other in|conueniences.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Councell of Towrs.</NOTE>IN the yeere of our Lord, 813. and at the commandement of the Emperour <HI>Carolus Magnus,</HI> a Councell of many Bishops and Abbots, was assembled, about establishing of Ecclesiasticall discipline, in the towne of Towers.</P>
<P>In the first Canon, all men are admonished to be obedi|ent to the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the Great, and to keepe the oath of allegeance made vnto him, and to make prayers, and supplications for his prosperity and wel-fare. 2. All Bi|shoppes shall diligently reade, and frequently peruse, the bookes of holy Scripture, the histories of the Euangels, and the Epistles of <HI>Paul,</HI> together with the bookes of ancient Fa|thers written thereupon. 3. It is not lawfull for any Bi|shop to bee ignorant of the Canons of the Church, and of
<PB N="637" REF="327">
the Pastorall booke of <HI>Gregorius,</HI> in the which every man, as in a liuely mirrour might see himselfe. 4. Let every Bi|shop feede the flocke committed vnto him, not onely with doctrine, but also with examples of good conversation. 5. A Bishop must not be giuen to sumptuous banquets, but be content with a moderate diet, lest hee should seeme to abuse the counsell of our Lord, saying; <HI>Take heed, that your hearts be not surfeited with gluttony, or drunkennesse</HI>: but let holy lecture be at his table, rather then the idle wordes of flatte|ring fellowes. 6. Let strangers and indigent people bee at Bishops tables: whom they may refresh, both with corporall and spirituall repast. 7. The delicate pleasure of the eare and eyes, are to bee eschewed, left by such pleasures, the minde be effeminate, and inchanted. 8. Let not the Lords servants delight in vaine gesting, nor in hunting, nor haw|king. 9. Let Presbyters and Deacons follow the foot-steps of their Bishops, assuring themselues, that the good conuer|sation enioyned vnto their Bishops, is also enioyned vnto them. 10. Let Bishops haue a great sollicitude and care towards the poore: and be faithfull dispensators of Ecclesi|asticall goods, as the Ministers of God, and not as hun|ters after filthy lucre. 11. It is lawfull for Bishops, with consent of Presbyters and Deacons, to bestow out of the Church treasure, to support indigent people of that same Church. 12. A Presbyter is not to be ordained vntill hee bee thirtie yeere old. 13. Let the Bishop make diligent in|quisition in his owne parish Church, that no Presbyter, com|ming from any other parts, make seruice in his Church, without letters of recommendation. 14. Let a Presbyter, leaving a low place, and presuming to an higher, incurre that same punishment, which a Bishop, deprehended in the like fault, should incurre. 15. A Presbyter, who attaineth to a Church, by giving money for it, let him bee deposed. 16. Let tythes bestowed vpon Churches, by advice of Bi|shops, be faithfully distributed to the poore, by the Presby|ters. 17. The families of Bishops shall be instructed in the summe of the true faith. In the knowledge of the retribu|tion
<PB N="638" REF="328">
to be given to good men, and the condemnation of people, and of the resurrection and last iudgement, and by what kinde of workes eternall life may be promerited: and that the Homilies, containing these instructions, shall bee translated into Rusticke-Latine-language: to the end that e|very person may vnderstand them. Marke in what estima|tion the Latine language hath beene at this time: that in|structions in Rusticke and barbarous Latine, are counted better then instructions in good French language. 18. It is the dutie of the Bishop, to instruct his Presbyter concer|ning the Sacrament of Baptisme, what it is that they should desire the people baptized to renounce: namely, that they should renounce the divell, and all his workes, and his pomps. Now the workes of the Diuell, are murther, forni|cation, adulterie, drunkennesse, and other such like faults. But the pompes of the Divell, are pride, ostentation, swel|ling conceits, vaine-glory, loftinesse, and such other faults, as spring vp from such grounds. 19. Presbyters are pre|cisely to be admonished, that when they say the masse, and do communicate, they doe not distribute the Lords bodie indiscreetly, to children, and to all persons, who happen to be present, who if they be entangled with great sinnes, they procure vnto themselues rather damnation, then any reme|die to their soules, according to the saying of the Apostle, <HI>Whosoeuer eateth this Bread, and drinketh this Cup unworthily, hee shall be guilty of the bodie and blood of the Lord: Let a man therefore try himselfe, and so let him eate of this Bread, and drinke of this Cup.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> By this let the iudicious Reader marke, that e|ven in the dayes of <HI>Carolus Magnus,</HI> priuate masses had no place: but they who were duly prepared, did communicate with the Priest. 20. Presbyters shall not suffer the holy Chrisme to be touched by every man. 21. Presbyters shall not resort to Tavernes, to eate or drinke. 22. Bishops and Presbyters, shall prescribe to sinners, who haue confessed their sinnes, penance, discreetly, according to the waighti|nesse of their fault. 23. Chanons, who dwell in Cities, let them eate in one Cloyster, and sleepe vnder one roofe, to
<PB N="639" REF="328">
the end they may bee ready to celebrate their Canonicall houres. From the 24. Canon vnto the 32. are contained constitutions concerning Monkes and Nunnes, which I o|uer-passe with silence, fearing to be prolix.</P>
<P>Canon 32. All men should studie to peace and concord, but especially Christians: forsaking hatred, discord, and en|vie. 33. Lords and Iudges should be obedient to the whol|some admonitions of their Bishops: and Bishops on the o|ther part, should reverently regard them, to the end they may be mutually supported, every one with the consolati|ons one of another. 34. Lords and Iudges are to bee ad|monished, that they admit not vile and naughty persons to beare witnesse in their iudicatories, because there are many, who for a contemptible price, are ready to make shipwracke of a good conscience. 35. Let no man for his decreet, re|ceiue a reward: For divine Scripture in many places forbid|deth this, <HI>as a thing that blindeth the eyes of the blind.</HI> 36. Let euery man be carefull to support indigent persons of his owne family and kindred: for it is an impious and abomi|nable thing in the sight of God, that men abounding in riches, should neglect their owne. 37. Christians when they make supplications to God, let them in humble man|ner bow downe their knees, following the example of the Martyr <HI>Steven,</HI> and of the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI>: Except vpon the Lords day, and other solemne dayes, on the which the vni|versall Church keepeth a memoriall of the Lords resurrecti|on: and at such times they are accustomed to stand and pray. 38. Faithfull people must be admonished, not to enter in|to the Church, with tumult and noyse: and in time of prayer, and celebration of the masse, not to be occupied in vaine confabulations, and idle speeches: but even to abstain from wicked cogitations. 39. Let not the Consistories and Iudgement-seates of secular Iudges be in the Church, or portches thereof, in any time to come: because the house of God should bee an house of Prayer, as our Lord Iesus Christ saith. 40. Let it be forbidden, that Merchandize be vsed vpon the Lords day, or Iustice-Courts, because all
<PB N="640" REF="329">
men should abstaine from servile labours, to the end this day may be spent in praising and thanking God, from mor|ning till evening. 41. Incestuous persons, parracides, and murtherers, are found, who will not hearken to the whol|some admonitions of Church-men, but persevere in their vitious conversation, who must be reduced to order by the discipline of the secular power. 42. Let the people be ad|monished to abstaine from Magicall Arts, which can bring no support and helpe to the infirmities of men, and beasts: but they are the deceitfull snares of the Divell, whereby he deceiveth man-kinde. 43. A frequent custome of swearing is forbidden, wherein men, vpon euery light occasion wil|ling to purchase credit to that which they speake, they take God to be witnesse of the verity of their speeches. 44. Ma|ny free subiects, by the oppression of their Masters, are re|dacted to extreame pouerty; whose causes, if our element Soveraigne please to examine, hee shall finde, that they are vniustly redacted to extreame indigence. 45. A false mea|sure, and a false ballance, is an abomination vnto the Lord, as <HI>Salomon</HI> recordeth.</P>
<P>The 46. Canon containeth a regrate, that tythes were not duly payed to the Church: notwithstanding, that the Church had giuen in, their complaint to the civil Magistrate: whereby it came to passe, that not only lights in the Church, and stipends to the Clergie, began to inlacke, but also the very parish Churches became ruinous. 47. When gene|rall Fastings are appointed, for any impendent calamity, let man neglect the fellowship of the humble Church, for de|sire to feed his belly with delicate foode. 48. Drunkennes and surfeiting are forbidden, as offensiue both to soule and bodie, and the ground of many other sinnes. 49. Lords and Masters are to be admonished, not to deale cruelly and vnmercifully with their subiects: yea, and not to seeke that which is due vnto themselues, with excessiue rigour. 50. Let Laicke people communicate at least thrise in a yeere, vnlesse they be hindred by some grivous sinnes committed by them. 51. In the last Canon mention is made, that
<PB N="641" REF="329">
they diligently examined the cause of them who complai|ned to the Emperour, that they were dis-inherited by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> donation of lands, which their Fathers and friends had be|stowed vpon the Church: and in their bounds they found no man who did complaine. Alwaies, in that matter, if any thing was done amisse, they humbly submitted themselues to be corrected by their Soveraigne Lord and King.</P>
<P>THe Councell of Chalons was the fourth Councell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Councell of Chalons.</NOTE> con|vened in the yeere of our Lord, 813. by the comman|dement of <HI>Charles</HI> the Great, for the reformation of the Ec|clesiasticall Estate. Many of the Canons of this Councell are coincident with the Canons of the former: therefore I shall be the shorter in the commemoration thereof.</P>
<P N="1">1. That Bishops acquaint themselues diligently with reading the bookes of holy Scripture, and the Bookes of ancient Fathers, together with the Pastorall bookes of <HI>Gre|gorius.</HI> 2. Let Bishops practice in their workes, the know|ledge which they haue attained vnto by by reading. 3. Let them also constitute Schooles, wherein learning may be in|creased, and men brought vp in them, that may be like to the salt of the earth, to season the corrupt manners of the peo|ple, and to stop the mouthes of Heretiques, according as it is said, to the commendation of the Church, <HI>A thousand Targes are hung vp in it, even all the Armour of the strong, Cant. chap.</HI> 4 <HI>vers.</HI> 4. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 4. Let Church-men shew humility, in word, deed, countenance, and habite. 5. Let Priests bee vnreproueable, adorned with good manners, and not given to filthy lucre. 6. The blame of filthy lucre, wherewith many Church-men were charged, for this, that they allu|red secular men to renounce the world, and to bring their goods to the Church, they endeuour, with multiplyed number of words, to remoue. 7. Bishops, and Abbots, who with deceitfull speeches, haue circumvened simple men, and shauen their heads, and by such meanes doe pos|sesse their goods, in respect of their covetous desire of filthy lucre, let them be subiect to Canonicall, or regular repen|tance.
<PB N="642" REF="330">
But let those simple men, who have layd downe their haire, as men destitute of vnderstanding, who cannot go|uerne their owne affaires, let them remaine in that estate, which they haue once vndertaken: but let the goods given by negligent Parents, and received, or rather reaved by ava|ritious Church-men, be restored againe to their children &amp; heires. 8. If Church men lay vp provision of come in Victuall-houses, let it not be to keepe them to a dearth, but to support the poore in time of need, therewith. 9. Hun|ting and hawking, and the insolency of foolish and filthy iests, are to bee forsaken of Church-men. 10. Gluttony and drunkennesse is forbidden. 11. The Bishop or Ab|bot, must not resort to civill iudicators, to plead their owne cause, except it be to support the poore and oppressed. Pres|byters, Deacons, and Monkes, having obtained licence from the Bishop, may compeare in Civill iudgement-seats, accom|panied with their Advocate. 12. Let not Presbyters, Dea|cons, or Monkes, bee farmers or labourers of the ground. 13. It is reported of some brethren, that they compell the persons who are to be admitted, in time of their ordination to sweare, that they are worthy: and that they shall do no|thing repugnant to the Canons:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> and that they shall be o|bedient to the Bishop, who ordayneth them, and to the Church, in the which they are ordayned: which oath, in regard it is perilous, we all inhibit, and discharge it. 14. Bi|shops in visiting of their Parishioners, let them not be charge|able vnto them, but rather comfortable, by preaching the Word, and by correcting things that are disordered. 15. It is reported, that some Arch-deacons vse domination over the Presbyters, and take tribute from them, which smelleth rather of tyranny, then of due order. For if the Bishoppe should not vse domination over the Clergie, but by exam|plars to the flocke, as the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> writeth: much lesse should these presume to doe any such like thing. 16. Like as in dedication of Churches, and for receiving of orders, no money is received: even so, for buying of Balme to make Chrisme, Presbyters (keepers of Chrisme) shall be|stowe
<PB N="643" REF="330">
no money: but Bishops, of their owne rents, shall furnish Baulme for the making of Chrisme, and Lightes to the Church. 17. It hath beene found in some places, that Presbyters haue payed 12. or 14. pennies in yeerely tri|bute to the Bishop: which custome wee haue ordained al|together to be abolished. 18. The receiuing of paunds from incestuous persons, and from men who pay not their Tythes, and from negligent Presbyters, is forbidden, as a thing which openeth a doore to auarice: but rather let Ec|clesiasticall discipline strike vpon transgressours. 19. Let people giue their Tythes to those Churches wherein their children are baptized, &amp; whereunto they resort all the yeere long, to heare Church-seruice. 20. Let peace bee kept a|mongst all men, but in speciall betwixt Bishops &amp; Countes; whereby euery one of them may mutually support another. 21. Ciuill Iudges ought to judge righteously, without ex|ception of persons, and without receiuing of rewards: and let their Officiars, Vicars, and Centenaries, bee righteous men: least, by their auarice and greedinesse, the people bee grieued, and impouerished. And let the witnesses be of vn|suspect credite: for by false witnesses the Countrey is great|ly damnified. 22. The Abbots and Monkes, in this part of the Countrie, seeing they haue addicted themselues to the Order of Saint <HI>Benedict</HI>: let them endeuour to con|forme themselues vnto his institution and rules. 23. The ordination of Presbyters, Deacons, and other inferiours, is to bee made at a certaine prescribed time. 24. Concerning Bishops, Presbyters, Deacons, and Monkes, who shall hap|pen to be llaine, let the Emperour giue determination to whom the satisfacton of blood shall belong. 25. In many places, the auncient custome of publicke repentance hath ceased: neither is the auncient custome of excommunicatio~ and reconciliation in vse. Therefore, the Emperour is to be entreated, that the ancient discipline may be restored againe, and they who sinne publikely, may be brought to publike repentance: and euery man, according as hee deserueth, may either bee excommunicated, or reconciled. 26. It
<PB N="644" REF="331">
is reported, that in some Churches there is contention and strife for diuidng of Church rents: It is ordained, therefore, That no Masse shall be said in those Churches, vntill they, who are at variance, be reconciled againe. 27. Neither the Sa|crament of Baptisme, nor the Sacrament of Confirmation, should be reiterated. 28. Concerning the decrees of affinitie, and in what degree Marriage may be bound vp, euery man is sent to the Canons of the Church to seeke resolution. 29. Se|ing that the man and the woman are counted in Scripture as one flesh, their Parentage is to be reckoned by like degrees in the matter of Marriage. 30. The Marriage of seruants is not to bee dissolued which is bound vp with consent of both their masters, euerie seruant remaining obedient to his owne master.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> 31. It is rumoured, that some women by negligence, and others fraudulently, doe present their owne children to the Sacrament of Confirmation, to the ende they may bee separated from the companie of their husbandes. Therefore, wee statute and ordaine, that such women as either negligently or fraudulently present their owne children to the Sacrament of Confirmation, they shall bee compelled to doe penance all the dayes of their life: neither shall they in any wise be separated from their husbandes. 32. Let a sinner confesse vnto his Fa|ther-Confessor, all his sinnes which hee hath committed either in thought, word, or deede: because that hatred, enuye, and pride, are such pestilentious botches of the soule: and the more secretly that they are couched, the more periculously they hurt. 33. Sinnes should not one|ly bee confessed to God, according to the example of <HI>Dauid,</HI> who saith, <HI>I will confesse against my selfe my wic|kednesse vnto the Lord, and thou forgauest the punishment of my sinne, Psal. 32. vers.</HI> 5. But also wee should confesse our sinnes to our Father-Confessor, according to the pre|cept of the Apostle, <HI>Acknowledge your faultes one to another and pray one for another, that yee may bee healed, I at.</HI> 5.16.34. In pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ibing of penance, let fauour and hatred of any person be laide aside, and let the injunctions be giuen
<PB N="645" REF="331">
according to the rule of holy Scripture, and according to the Canons and custome of the Church, following the ex|ample of the Physitions of the body, who without exception of persons doe adhibit cuttings, burnings, and vehement re|medies, to perilous diseases. 35. Many in doing of pe|nance, are not so desirous of remission of sinnes, as of the accomplishment of the prescribed time of their humilia|on: and beeing forbidden to eate flesh, or drinke wine, they haue the greater desire of other delicate meates and drinkes: but spirituall abstinence, which should bee in peni|tent persons, excludeth all bodily delightes. 36. Let no man sinne of purpose, to the ende hee may abolishe his sinnes by Almes-deedes: for that is all one as if a man should hyre God to grant vnto him a libertie to sinne. 37. Seeing all Canons of Councels are to be diligently read, in speciall such as appertaine vnto faith, and reformation of manners, should bee most frequently perused. 38. Bookes, called <HI>Libelli Poenitentiales,</HI> are to abolished, because the er|roures of these Bookes are certaine, howbeit the authors of them be vncertaine: and they prepare pillowes to lay vn|der the heads of them, who are sleeping in sinne. 39. In the solemnities of the Masse, Prayers are to bee made for the soules of them who are departed, as well as for them who are aliue. 40. Presbyters, who are degraded, &amp; liue like se|culare men, neglecting repentance, whereby they might pro|cure restitution to their office, let them be excommunicated. 41. A Presbyter, who transporteth himselfe from his owne place, shall not be receiued in any other Church, except hee prooue, both with witnesses and letters sealed with lead, &amp; containing the name of the Bishop, and of the Citie which he liued in, that he hath liued innocently in his own Church, and had a just cause of transportation. 42. Let no Church bee committed to a Presbyter, without consent of the Bi|shop. 43. In some places are found Scots-men, who call themselues Bishops, &amp; they ordaine Presbyters &amp; Deacons, whose ordination we altogether disallowe. 44. Presbyters must not drinke in Tavernes, wander in Markets, nor goe
<PB N="646" REF="332">
to visite Cities, without aduise of their Bishop. 45. Many both of the Clergie &amp; Laickes, go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to holy places, such as Rome, &amp; Turon: imagining, that by the sight of these places, their sins are remitted: and not attending to the sentence of <HI>Ierome, It is a more commendable thing to liue well in Hierusalem, than to haue seene Hierusalem.</HI> 46. In receiuing the Sacrament of the bodie and blood of Christ, great discretion is to be vsed: Neither let the taking of it be long differred, because Christ saith, <HI>Except yee eate the flesh of the sonne of man, and drinke his bloud, yee haue no life in you</HI>: Neither let vs come with|out due preparation, because the Apostle saith, <HI>He who eateth and dri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">keth vnworthily, eateth and drinketh his owne damnation.</HI> 47. The Sacrament of the body &amp; blood of Christ which in one day is accustomed to be receiued of all Christi|ans: let no man neglect to receiue it, except some grieuous crime doe hinder him from receiuing of it. 48. According to the precept of the Apostle <HI>Iames, Weake persons should be an|nointed with oyle by the Elders,</HI> (<HI>which oyle is blessed by the Bi|shop</HI>) these words inclosed in a parenthesis are added to the Text: for he saith, <HI>Is any man sicke amongst you, let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray for him, and an|noint him with oyle, in the Name of the Lord: And the prayer of faith shal saue the sicke, and the Lord shall raise him vp: And if he haue committed sin, it shal be forgiuen him, I am. cap.</HI> 5. <HI>vers.</HI> 14.15. Such a medicine as cureth both bodily &amp; spirituall maledies is not to be neglected. 49. In the Councell of Laodicea it was forbidden, that Masses should bee said, and Oblations offered by Bishops, or Presbyters, in priuate houses. This question also was disputed in this Councell. 50. The autho|ritie of the Emperour, is to be interponed for reuerent kee|ping of the Lords day. 51. Because the Church is constitu|ted of persons of diuerse conditions, some are Noble, others are ignoble, some are seruants, vassalles, stran|gers, &amp;c. It becommeth them who are in eminent rowmes, to deale mercifully with their inferiours, knowing that they are their brethren, because God is one common Fa|ther to both, and the Church is one common mother to
<PB N="647" REF="332">
both. From the 52. Canon vnto the 66. are contained pre|cepts of chaste and honest liuing prescribed to Prioresses and Nunnes. which I ouer-passe, as I haue done in the pre|ceeding Councels. 66. It is ordained, that prayers and sup|plications shall be made for the Emperour and his children, and for their well-fare both in soule and bodie. 67. These things haue we touched shortly, to be exhibited to our So|ueraigne Lord the Emperour. Hee who desireth a more ample declaration of all vertues to be followed, and vices to be eschewed, let him read the volume of the holy Scriptures of God.</P>
<P>IN the same yeere of our Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Councel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Arles.</NOTE> wherein the preceding foure Councels were conueened, &amp; by the mandate of the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the Great, another Councell was con|neened at Arles. The Canons of this Councell were in number. 25.</P>
<P>1. They set downe a Confession of their Faith. 2. They ordaine, That Prayers shall bee made for the Emperour, and his children. 3. They admonish Bishops and Pastors dili|gently to reade the bookes of holy Scripture: To teach the Lords people in all truth: and, To administrate the Sacra|ments rightly. 4. Laick people are admonished, not to re|mooue their Presbyters from their Churches, without con|sent of their Bishops. 5. That Presbyters be not admitted for rewards. 6. It is ordained, That Bishops shall attend, that euery person liue ordinately: that is, according to a prescri|bed rule. The 7. and 8. Canons belong to the ordering of Monkes and Nunnes. The 9. Canon pertaineth to the pay|ment of Tythes, and first fruits. 10. It is ordained, That Pres|byters shall preach the word of God, not only in Cities, but also in euery Parochin. 11.

Let the Sabboth day be kept holy, without Markets, Iustice Courtes, and seruile labour. 17.

<P>More-ouer, the worshipping of Images in this Councell got a new allowance againe, and it was commanded, That the image of Christ should be holden in no lesse reuerence than the bookes of the Gospell.</P>
<P>The Bulgarians also were made subject to the Romane Bishop.

<P>First, it was concluded in this Councell, that excommu|nicate persons, if they repent not, are to be subdued by the Emperour. Canon 10. That a Bishop shall not bee depo|sed, before his cause bee iudged by twelue Bishops: and a

Tythes are to be paid for the sustentation of the Ministery, the support of the poore, and the fabricke of the Church. 15. Let mens bodies be buried in that Parish, vnto the which they payed their tythes. 16. No buriall place shall be sold for mony. 17. Let Laicke people be buried in the Church-yard, not in the Church: but if they be buried already, let not their bodies be remooved. 18.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Councell of Canterbury in England.</NOTE>IN the yeere of our Lord, 975. a Councell was gathered in England, at Canterburie. The question debated in the Councell, was concerning the marriage of men in spirituall offices. <HI>Dunstanus</HI> at this time was Bishop of Canterburie, and he was an adversarie to the marriage of men in spirituall offices. But the question was so wel discussed by testimonies of Scripture, and the Fathers of the Primitiue Church, that <HI>Dunstanus</HI> had cause to be ashamed. For this cause hee im|plored the helpe of the Diuell: for he was knowne to be a Sorcerer. Satan compelled him to persist in his argument. And when they were convened againe, and in the heate of their disputation, a voyce sounded from the Image of the Crucifix (which was in the place of their convention) that <HI>Dunstanus</HI> his opinion was the best.</P>
<P>This lying miracle so dashed the multitude of simple and ignorant Priestes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hist.

This matter so displeased the Patriarch <HI>Polyeuchus,</HI> that hee debarred the Emperour <HI>Nicephorus</HI> from holy things, pretending these two causes: First, because the Emperour had celebrated the second marriage. Secondly, because <HI>Nicephorus</HI> had beene witnesse in Baptisme, to the children of <HI>Theophania.</HI> This
<PB N="657" REF="337">
question being discussed in the Councell, in presence both of Prelats and Counsellers, the Emperours marriage was allowed, and the acts alledged by <HI>Polyeuchus</HI> was counted impious, &amp; made by <HI>Capronimus,</HI> and that they had no force to hinder the marriage. The proud Patriarch when he was overthrowne by reason, armed himselfe with obstinacie and stiffe neckednesse, vntill <HI>Bardas</HI> the Emperours father came to him, and affirmed by an oath, that <HI>Nicephorus</HI> the Empe|rour was not witnesse in Baptisme to the children of <HI>Theo|phania.</HI> Thus were the Patriarches of the East, serious in ob|serving the traditions of men, but remisse and negligent in observing the ordinances of God.

The Emperor thought it no time to slumber nor sleepe, when this sediti|ous Pope threatned to cut him off from the body of the Church, if hee did not compeare before his Iudgement-seat.

These were read openly in the Councell, <HI>Hildebrand</HI> was accused of periury, and ambition, of avarice, and of pride: and they desired that <HI>Hildebrand</HI> might bee displaced, and another seated in his roome. The determina|tion of the Councell was this, that <HI>Hildebrand,</HI> who called

himselfe <HI>Gregorie</HI> the seventh, a forclopen Monke, an vsur|per of the Popedome, without consent of the Emperour, and against his oath, a false interpreter and wrester of holy Scripture, a renter of vnity, a man who mixed all divine and humane things so together, that he polluted them both, a man who heard the false accusations of vngodly people, who in one cause would be an accuser, a witnesse, a Iudge, and an enemy: who separated husbands from their wiues, and preferred whoredome to lawfull marriage: who stirred vp the people against their Bishops, and teachers: who counted no man consecrated lawfully, except hee had bought his Prelacie from his dependers, and begged it from himselfe, a seeker of popular applause, and a deceiver of the people, vnder colour of religion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a man who like to <HI>Decius,</HI> and the rest of the persecuting Emperours, and worshippers of false gods, vsurped both Empire and the Priesthood.</P>

He approached neere to the towne, but the river of Rhene was interiected betweene them. The Emperour in all submissiue manner, promised to amend all the faults whereof they complained. But their hearts being possessed with a superstitious favour to the chaire of Rome, and being inclinable to sedition &amp; alteration of the State: they returned a very hard answer to the Emperour, wherein they made a commemoration of all his youthly infirmities, and how their expectation of his amendment, had often-times decei|ued them. But seeing their consciences witnessed vnto them,

that infirmities in Princes is no sufficient cause to shake off the yoke of their obedience. Therefore in the end, they pre|tend that in case they adhered any longer to him, they were in danger to incurre the condemnation of their own soules, because hee was excommunicated by the Apostolick chaire. This Councell is like vnto a looking glasse, wherein two things may bee evidently seene, to wit, the inconstancy of people, and pride of the Roman Antichrist, bearing downe the authority of Princes, for desire of his owne advance|ment.</P>

For hee called them the head of the world, having power to conferre all spirituall and civill dignities to whom they pleased. Like as 270. yeeres agoe, they transferred the Empire from the Grecians, to the Germanes. And like as the Emperour may displace an vnworthy souldier, even so a souldier may forsake an vnrighteous Captaine.

They opposed themselues to Empe|rours, and most contemptuously abused them; they depra|ued the articles of Faith, prophaned the Sacraments institu|ted by Christ. Idolatry dayly increased, hypocriticall disci|pline through propagation of Monastique orders, and hu|mane constitutions, were out of measure extolled.

Ther|fore they proceed against the noble Emp. being absent, and condemned him of heresie, &amp; exco~municated him. Now his heresie was Simony, because he wold not resigne the right of investme~t of Bishops into the Popes hands.

headstrong Prelats, because his armie and friends were not about him. But he demaunded the three Bishops in the sight of the eternall God, to declare if hee had taken any reward for admitting them to their Bishopriks. The Bishops of Mentz, Colen, and Wormes, all affirmed; that he had recei|ued no reward from their hands. How then (sayth the Em|perour) am I condemned of Simonie?

But the Prelats forementioned, stirring vp one another, put hands to worke and pulled the Crowne from his head, and denuded him of the rest of his Imperiall Ornaments. The Emperour with sighes and sobbs committed his cause to God who hateth iniquitie, and in his own time can render a condigne recompence vnto it.

Therefore he reque|sted that the Pope and Councell would doe nothing preiu|diciall to his right.

As they were singing, according to their custome, the Hymne, <HI>Veni sancte spiritus,</HI> there was at the same time, a certaine paper set vp in the Church, by some well disposed persons, as it seemed, wherein was contained these words following;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Alys rebus occupatinunc, adesse vobis non possumus</HI>: that is, wee are otherwise occupied at this time, wee cannot intend to come to you. In this Councell, was not onely Pope <HI>Iohn</HI> the 23. deposed, for many grievous and haynous crimes, obiected and prooved against him, but also <HI>Gregory</HI> and <HI>Benedict,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">All the three Popes deposed</NOTE> sustayned the like censure; and Pope <HI>Martin</HI> was chosen, as hath beene declared. Many wicked things were decreed and done in this Councell; as namely, in the eight Session thereof, a sentence of condemnation was gi|ven out against the doctrine of <HI>Iohn Wickliffe,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A decree a|gainst <HI>Iohn Wickliffe.</HI> Against the Communion in both kinds.</NOTE> and for the hatred of his memorie, his bones ordained to be raysed out of his sepulchre, and to be burnt.

kindes of bread and wine.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iohn Husse</HI> condemned.</NOTE> In the 15. Session the Sentence of <HI>Iohn Husse</HI> his condemnation was read and published, and he was deliuered to the secular power to be burned.</P>
<P>In the 19. Session it was decreed that notwithstanding the safe conduct giuen by the Emperour and kings; inquirie may be made against a man for heresie, by a sufficient iudge, and processe to be made according to Law.</P>
<P>In the 21. Session a sentence of condemnation was pro|nounced against <HI>Ierom</HI> of Prague;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ierom</HI> of Prague con|demned.</NOTE> and hee was deliuered to the secular power to be burned. And finallie nothing was decreed in this Councell or enacted worthy of memorie, but this only that the Popes authoritie is vnder the Councell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Councell aboue the Pope.</NOTE> &amp; that the Councell ought to iudge the Pope, yet albeit Arti|cles were giuen in to the Councell crauing reformation of the Corrupt life of the Clergie and namely of the Court of Rome, and <HI>Ioannes Gerson</HI> Chaunceller of the vniuersitie of Paris himselfe gaue in 75. abuses which hee willed to bee corrected and amended, no reformatio~ was obtained; because the chiefe gouernors of the Councell themselues being men of corrupt and filthie conversation, hated aboue all things the Articles of reformation.</P>
<P>But on the other part this new Pope <HI>Martine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Martin</HI> not ha|ving leasure to reforme the abuses of the Clergie erects an inquisition for repressing of the Hussits.</NOTE> although hee could not finde time and leasure to reforme the abuses of the clergie, yet found he time to deuise a cruell &amp; bloody inquisition against the true professours of the Gospel whom hee called Heretikes, and for repressing of the Hussites hee deuised a strict inquisitio~, which afterward followed in many Countries, and namely in the countrie of Spaine.</P>
<P>IN the yeere of our Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Councel of Basil.</NOTE> was gathered a generall Councell at Basil; which as it indured longer then any o|ther Councell before celebrat and holden in the Church (for this continued almost 17. yeeres) so likewise was it most troublesome, in respect that <HI>Iulian</HI> Cardinall and Deacon of S. <HI>Angel,</HI> being appointed president of the Councel, by Pope <HI>Martin</HI> the fift and after his death being also approued by his successor <HI>Eugenius</HI> the fourth.</P>
<P><PB N="692" REF="355"><NOTE PLACE="marg">A generall Councell a|boue the Pope</NOTE>This <HI>Iulian</HI> (I say) suffered a certaine question to be reasoned freely in the Councell, touching the authoritie of generall Councells; after which reasoning it was conclu|ded that the generall Councell is aboue the Pope, and that all persons ought to be subiect to the generall councells, as children are subiect to authoritie of their mother. This con|clusion grieued the Pope the more, that this matter being once concluded in the Councell of Constants alreadie; was now againe ratified and more amply discoursed in the Councell of Basil, for this cause he would haue transported the Councell to Bononie.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eugenius</HI> seeketh to translate the Councel from Basil to Bono|nie, but by the Emperour is forced to ra|tifie the Coun|cell of Basil.</NOTE> But the Emperour <HI>Sigismund</HI> (who was a great fauourer and protector of the Councell) with aduice of the fathers of the Councel; admonished <HI>Eu|genius</HI> that hee should not onely leaue off his intended pur|pose of transferring the place of the Councell, but also by his owne appearance before the Councell of Basil, ratifie his subiection to the same, which if he refused to doe they would proceede against him as a person contumacious, &amp; obstinat|ly, rebelling against the voyce of the Church. The Pope was so dashed with this admonition, that he was constrained to dissemble for a time, and to confirme the Councell of Basil with his Apostolike letters.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eugenius</HI> after the Emperours death holds contrarie Councels.</NOTE> But after the death of the Emperour (who died in the sixt yeere of the Councell) <HI>Eugenius</HI> tooke vpon him greater boldnesse, and first held a contrarie Councell at Ferraria and afterward at Florence, pretending that he behoued to meet with the Greekes for vniting of them to the West Church; who because they would no wayes passe the Alpes, he was compelled for their commoditie to keepe a Councell in some neerer place.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eugenius</HI> de|posed.</NOTE> The Councell of Basil although weakned by the Emperours death, proceeded not the lesse to the deposition of <HI>Eugenius</HI>; and elected <HI>Amedeus</HI> Duke of Sauoy, to be Pope whom they called <HI>Foelix</HI> the fift. To this Councell were the Bohemi|ans and Morauians invited, who after they had receiued suf|ficient suretie and pledges for their safe passage &amp; returning againe, sent Ambassadours to the Councell, by whose earnest trauels it was obtained that the Bohemians and Morauians

should haue the communion celebrat vnto them vnder both kinds.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bohemi|ans obtaine to haue the Sa|crament vn|der both kinds. <HI>Aeneas Syluius</HI> changeth his opinion with his state of life.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Historie of this Councell was written by <HI>Aeneas Syl|uius</HI> who was present at the same, and liked well of the pro|ceedings and determinations thereof, as may appeare by his owne writings; and namely by a certaine Epistle of his written to the Rector of the vniuersitie of Colen, wherein he reioyceth for a certaine treatise of the said rectors which came into his hands: reprouing the rudenesse and rashnesse of such as deny the Bishop of Rome and his consistory, to be subiect to the Generall Councell, and that the supreme tribunall seat of iudgement standeth in the Church, and not in one Bishop. Notwithstanding the same <HI>Syluius</HI> who by his learned writings advanced the decrees of the Councell of Basil, yet afterward being promoted to that papall digni|tie himselfe, turned his coat; and returned againe to the old filthy pride of the Chaire of Rome, which magnifieth it selfe not onely aboue the Church, but also maketh it selfe companion to God himselfe.</P>
<P>IN the yeere of our Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Councell of Florence.</NOTE> 1439. while as the Councell of Basil was yet sitting vndissolued; <HI>Eugenius</HI> the fourth per|ceiuing that matters went against him in Basil, he held a con|trarie Councell at Florence, where he brought to passe that the Emperour and Patriarch of Constantinople with the rest of the Grecians there present, were perswaded to receiue the sentence of the Church of Rome concerning the procee|ding of the holy Ghost, also to receiue the communion in vnleauened bread, to admit Purgatorie, and to yeeld them|selues to the authoritie of the Romish Bishop, wherevnto notwithstanding the other Churches of Grecia would in no wise assent at their comming home; in so much that with a publict execration, they did condemne afterward all those Legats which had consented to those Articles, that none of them should be buried in Christian buriall.</P>
<P>It is to be noted in this Councell, that the Grecians who agreed to other opinions of the Roman Church, yet could
<PB N="694" REF="356">
neuer be induced to beleeue their doctrine of transubstan|tiation. Notwithstanding they were content to set forth vnto <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> the people a Bull of agreement which they called <HI>Bulla Con|sensus,</HI> and the difference of opinions in that point of doc|crine was not thought a sufficient impediment to stay the promulgation of this agreement. Howbeit afterward as it were forgetting what they had done themselues in the Cou~|cels of Florence &amp; their <HI>Bulla Consensus,</HI> they cry out that there is no agreement &amp; vnitie amongst the Protestants, be|cause there is some difference of opinions about the Sacra|ment among them. In the time of this Councell, <HI>Iosephus</HI> Patriarch of Constantinople died, &amp; <HI>Eugenius</HI> required that presently before the dissolution of the Councell another should be chosen; but to this the Grecians would not agree, affirming that it was not lawfull to choose a Patriarch of Co~|stantinople, but onely in their owne Church there.

Howbeit (with those fathers licence)
<PB N="696" REF="357">
the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> declareth his owne sense and meaning, that hee calleth concupiscence sinne, because it is a transgressi|on of the Law, so that he accounteth it a sinne properly and indeed. Also in this Session they decerne, that the mother of our Lord was not conceived in originall sinne.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sessio quinta.</HI></NOTE>In the fift Session was decerned, that even after the fall of <HI>Adam,</HI> and in the nature of man before his regeneration, there remaineth a free-will to doe good; which being wake|ned by God, and stirred vp, is a fellow-bearer with his grace.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sessio sexta.</HI></NOTE>In the sixt Session was concluded, that man is iustified partly by faith in Christ, and partly by workes; and that our iustification stands not in a free forgiuenesse of sinnes, and a free imputation of the righteousnesse of Christ, to all them who beleeue in him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sessio septima.</HI></NOTE>The seventh Session was kept the third of March, <HI>an.</HI> 1547. wherein was decerned that all men should beleeue, that the Sacraments of the Church were seven in number; to wit, Baptisme, Confirmation, the Eucharist, Penance, Extreme Vnction, Orders, and Matrimonie. After this seventh Ses|sion, the Popes Physition affirmed, that the ayre of Trent was corrupted;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diuers Bishops remoue from Trent to Bo|nonia.</NOTE> whereupon many of the Bishops were mo|ved to depart from Trent, to Bononia; onely the Bishoppes of Spaine remained still at Trent, being commanded by <HI>Charles</HI> the Emperour, so to doe. For the Emperour had gathered in Ausbrugh an assembly of the States of Germa|ny, and had induced the most part by menaces and threate|nings, and some also by alluring promises, to submit them|selues to the generall Councell of Trent.</P>
<P>And this being obtained of the States of Germa|ny, the Emperour sent the Cardinall of Trent, toge|ther with his Ambassadour <HI>Mendoza,</HI> desiring that the Pope would cause the Bishoppes that were retyred to Bo|nonia, to come backe againe to Trent.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI> The Pope vn|willing the Bi|shops should returne to Trent.</NOTE> But the providence of God pitying the weakenesse of Germany (whom the Em|perour had induced, to bee obedient to the Councell of Trent) hardened the Popes heart, who would not consent

that the Bishops should goe backe againe to Trent, but vpon strict conditions: 1. That the Bishops of Spaine who re|mained yet still at Trent, should first come to Bononia. 2.
