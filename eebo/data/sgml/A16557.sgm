<P><HI>Comfort my people</HI>] in this commission obserue first Gods bounty, then his Prophets duty. You may behold the riches of Gods mercy toward his afflicted people. 1. In raysing vp Prophets vnto them in their captiuity, when as otherwise they might haue complained with the Psalmist, <HI>O</HI> <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Psal. 74. 1. 10.</NOTE> <HI>God, wherefore art thou absent from vs so long, and why is thy wrath so kindled against the sheepe of thy pasture? we see not our tokens, there is not one Prophet more, no not one is there among vs that vnderstandeth any more.</HI></P>
<P>2. <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Caluin</NOTE> For that he sent not one or two, but many: the number is plurall, comfort <HI>ye,</HI> speake <HI>ye,</HI> <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Psalm. 68. 11.</NOTE> the Lord gi|uing his word, great was the number of the Preachers.</P>
<P>3. For that he called not all his Prophets at once, but at sundry times according to the Churches exigence. Wherefore <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Musculus, Caluin.</NOTE> some read not as our translation here, <HI>saith your God</HI> in the present; but in the future, <HI>will your God say:</HI> <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Geneuaglosse.</NOTE> Signifying hereby that God will in all ages to come so prouide for his Church, as that it shall neuer be destitute of Prophets; and so we finde in holy Bible that he stirred vp <HI>Daniel, Haggai, Malachi, Zachariah, Ezra, Nehemiah,</HI> and other (vntill the comming of Christ himselfe the <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Pet.</HI> 54.</NOTE> chiefe shepheard) who did alwayes ex|hort his people <HI>to be of good comfort,</HI> and to <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Rom. 4. 18.</NOTE> hope a|gainst hope, so <HI>Zacharias</HI> in his hymne; Blessed be the Lord God of Israel for he hath visited and redeemed his people, raysing vp the horne of saluation vnto vs, <HI>as he spake by the mouth of all his Prophets which haue beene</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="3">
<HI>since the world began. So S. Peter</HI> in his Sermon <HI>adpo|pulum,</HI> Acts 3. 24. <HI>All the Prophets from Samuel, and thence forth as many as haue spoken haue likewise foretold of these dayes;</HI> and to Cornelius, Acts 10. 43. <HI>To him all the Prophets giue witnesse, that through his name all that beleeue in him shall receiue remission of sinnes.</HI></P>
<P>4. The <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Hyperius, Musculus.</NOTE> doubling and tripling of this charge to the Prophets (<HI>comfort ye, comfort ye, speake ye comfortably</HI>) expresseth as it were the very bowels of compassion in God, as if he could not endure that his people should suffer any more misery, giuing them also further assu|rance that he will euer be their God, euen in their grea|test aduersity, when as they seeme to bee swallowed vp of death and desperation, and that they shall be still his Hierusalem and his people, <HI>your God</HI> will say comfort <HI>my people.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning the Prophets office, God in this charge requireth on their part that they <HI>speake comfortably to his Hierusalems heart:</HI> Yet here you must obserue with <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Ecclesiast. 3. 1.</NOTE> Ecclesiastes, that <HI>there is a time for all things;</HI> a time for admonition, a time for reprehension, a time for consola|tion; a time <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Esay 58. 1.</NOTE> <HI>to shew Gods people their transgression, and to the house of Iacob their sinnes;</HI> as well as a time to tell Hierusalem in distresse that <HI>her trauell is ended, and her iniquity pardoned;</HI> a time saith our Prophet <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Esay 5.</NOTE> elsewhere, to denounce <HI>woe to such as iustify the wicked</HI> for a reward; a time to denounce <HI>woe to such as speake good of euill, and euill of good;</HI> a time to denounce <HI>woe to such as follow drunkennesse, and are strong to powre in strong drinke.</HI> And assuredly (beloued) the Prophets haue iust occasion in this age to cry out against such <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Amos 6. 1.</NOTE> <HI>as are at ease in Sion,</HI> making (as <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Philip. 3. 19.</NOTE> <HI>Paul</HI> speakes) <HI>their belly their God,</HI> and their gullet their glory. For swinish, idle, base drunkennesse heretofore scorned as the beggers fault, is now reputed (among moe then a good many) not only the seruing|mans complement, but also the gentlemans grace. God as hauing <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Ezech. 33. 11.</NOTE> <HI>no pleasure in the death of a sinner,</HI> but a lon|ging
<PB N="4" REF="4">
desire to haue the coalcs of his wrath quenched with the teares of our repentance, commandeth his Pro|phets in the dayes of securitie, to sound out the threats of his seuerity, denouncing a woe before woe, that is a woe of instruction, before there come the woe of de|struction. For albeit <HI>the</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Luke 3. 9.</NOTE> <HI>axe be laid vnto the root of the tree,</HI> yet shal it not be <HI>hewen downe</HI> so long as there is any hope of <HI>the fruites of amendment.</HI> Though there be <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Ionas. 3.</NOTE> <HI>yet but fortie dayes, and Nineue shall be destroyed, yet if Nine|ue proclaime a fast, and put on sackcloth from the grea|test vnto the least; the Lord will repent of the euill he sayed he would doe vnto them, and turne away from his fierce wrath.</HI> As soone then as Hierusalem <HI>hath receiued at the Lords hand sufficient correction for all her sins,</HI> it is time <HI>to tell her that her trauayle is at an end, and that her of|fence is pardoned.</HI> After once the law hath humbled and terrified distressed consciences; after all her <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Psalm. 42. 9.</NOTE> waues and stormes haue rent asunder troubled spirits, it is time <HI>to bring</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Esay 61.</NOTE> <HI>glad tidings of saluation vnto the poore, to bind vp the broken harted, to preach liberty to the Captiue, to com|fort all that mourne in Syon, to giue beauty for ashes, and the garment of gladnesse for the spirit of heauinesse,</HI> a|mong many, this one doubtlesse is the maine part in the Prophets office <HI>to comfort Hierusalem at the heart.</HI></P>
<P>This ought to be performed plainely, painefully, pow|erfully: <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Caluin.</NOTE> Plainly <HI>cry to her, and lift vp thy voice,</HI> for if the Prophet whisper only, this consolation happily might seeme doubtfull or weake, but all doubting is taken a|way, seeing it is to be deliuered freely with a loud voice: <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Musculus.</NOTE> Painefully, comforting Hierusalem againe and againe, <HI>comfort ye, comfort ye,</HI> &amp;c: <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Hyperius. Dan. Arcula|rius.</NOTE> Powerfully, for the Prophet ought to speake not only to Hierusalems eare, but also fully to her heart, that he may like a good Oratour <HI>relin|quere aculeos in auditorum animis:</HI> <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Ecclesiastes 12. 11.</NOTE> the wordes of the wise are like goades and like nayles fastened by the ma|sters of the assemblies, and the best way to fasten a nayle is to strike home, Gods word is an <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Ieremy 23. 29.</NOTE> hammer, and our
<PB N="5" REF="4">
exhortations are like nayles, and therefore we must of|ten and earnestly strike home that we may pricke the hearts of our hearers, as Saint <HI>Peter</HI> did Acts 2. 37.</P>
<P>Or as <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Hierom, Vata|blus, Caluin.</NOTE> other expound this clause, to speake <HI>to the heart of Hierusalem</HI> is in Scripture phrase nothing else but to speake that which is pleasing and acceptable. So <HI>Sychem</HI> the son of <HI>Hamor</HI> is said to speake to the heart of <HI>Dinah,</HI> Gen. 34. 3. Now the glad message to be prea|ched vnto Hierusalem is, <HI>that her trauaile is at an end, and her offence pardoned,</HI> for as Physitians in healing bo|dily diseases ordinarily remoue first the cause from whence they spring: euen so the Lord dealeth with vs in curing our spirituall infirmities. The rods wherewith he beateth vs proceed from our sinnes, hee must of ne|cessitie therefore pardon them, ere his strokes can cease, so that remission of our sinnes is the ground of our com|fort, that man and only that man is blessed <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Psalm. 32. 1.</NOTE> <HI>whose vn|righteousnesse is forgiuen, and whose sinne is couered,</HI> he that trauayles with mischiefe conceiues sorrow, Psalme 7. 15. <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Esay 57. 21.</NOTE> There is no peace to the wicked saith our God; a <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Socrates.</NOTE> heathen Philosopher could say, that <HI>the best way to shunne sadnes is to liue well.</HI> I do latrie, stincking drunken|nesse, and other sinnes are called by the Prophet <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg"><HI>Cap.</HI> 4. <HI>vers.</HI> 18. <HI>See Ribera. in loc.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Hosea shame,</HI> because they bring with them alway confusion and shame: Hierusalems warfare was neuer at an end, till her sinnes on her part were repented, and on Gods part pardoned.</P>
<P>But how was her offence forgiuen? because <HI>she had re|ceiued at the Lords hand double for all her sinnes:</HI> <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Musculus.</NOTE> that is double grace for her double griefe. As Hierusalem had a double punishment, one in her soule, another in her body: so now she shall haue by Christ a double blessing, to wit, in this world collation of grace, and in the world to come possession of glory; or a double fauour, 1. in that <HI>her trauaile is ended:</HI> 2. <HI>for that her sinne is pardoned,</HI> or <HI>double,</HI> <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Vatablus, Arcularius.</NOTE> that is many benefits, a certaine number for an vncertaine, the suffrings of Christ are a sufficient pro|pitiation

<P>1.

<P>2.

<P>2. This may teach vs humility; for if Angels high and holy serue vs, let vs not thinke it any bad or base dutie to <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Galat. 5. 13.</NOTE> serue one another in loue.</P>

to be done: but when an Astronomer saith of the wea|ther it shall not be cold, or hot, vpon such a moneth or day, he doth not forbid, but onely foretell a thing that shall not be: so the words, <GAP DESC="foreign">, are vsed Apocalip. 10. 6. and 22. 5. According to this twofold acception I finde a twofold construction of this clause (<HI>but yee not so</HI>) first, by way of prophecie; secondly, by way of proposition or prohibition: if it be taken Prophetically, then it is a prophecie concerning the disciples estate either in this, or in the world to come. If in this life, the meaning is briefly this, <HI>the kings of the Gentiles doe raigne, and they that are in authoritie are called benefactors; but ye not so:</HI> that is, I doe foreshew vnto you that ye shall not be so; as if he should say, they in their gouernement are cal|led benefactors, but you exercising authoritie shall be called malefactors: they ruling ill are called good men, ye ruling well shall be reputed euill men: <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Iohn 16. 33.</NOTE> in the world ye shall haue affliction, and ye must of necessitie drinke of my cup, and be baptized with the baptisme that I am baptized with, and so Christ is made to speake that in this place which he saith <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg"><HI>Mat.</HI> 10. 20. <HI>Iohn</HI> 15. 20.</NOTE> elsewhere, <HI>The disciple is not aboue his master, nor the seruant aboue his Lord: if they haue called the master of the house Belzebub, how much more them of his household.</HI> If they haue persecuted me, they will also persecute you: me, who came to minister vnto them, and to giue my life for them; euen so you, which in your authoritie shall intend the good of all, and spend your liues in seruing them all. This sense doubtles is true, for by wofull experience we finde it to be so, when as <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">See dange|rous positions vnder pretence of reformation lib. 2. cap. 5. 7. 8. 10. 11. 12. 13.</NOTE> among vs some for their superioritie, are called Antichrists; other for their authoritie, tyrants; other for restraining the licentiousnesse of certaine fa|ctious people, persecutors.</P>
<P>If we take (<HI>but yee not so</HI>) for a Prophecie touching the life to come, the meaning is, <HI>the kings of the Gentiles haue lordship ouer them,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>but ye not so:</HI> that is, in my kingdome (which you falsely conceiue to bee vpon

<HI>a Lord.</HI> It is true that our learned English interpre|tours in old time sought by (the <HI>periphrasis) gratious Lords,</HI> to set downe the meaning of Christ, vsing <HI>Lord</HI> for a title of honour, and <HI>gratious</HI> for a title of doing good. But our new translation expresseth it better in reading <HI>benefactors:</HI> the Kings of the Gentiles exercise Lordship ouer them, and they that exercise authority vpon them <HI>are called benefactors:</HI> so <HI>Beza, benefici vo|cantur:</HI> so the vulgar <HI>latine, Erasmus, Ro.

All that may be gathered hence then is, that the Kings of the Gentiles assumed flattering titles vnto themselues, being indeed nothing lesse then that which their stiles imported; and it may be a good admonition for all men, especially for Clergie men, to frame their liues answera|ble to their names and titles of honour giuen vnto them. An ambitious desire to be called <HI>benefactor</HI> is pro|hibited here, but the name it selfe is commendable, for Saint <HI>Peter</HI> applieth it vnto Christ, Acts 10. 38. <HI>Iesus of Nazareth went about doing good,</HI> and S. <HI>Paul</HI> exhorteth<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg"> <HI>Galat.</HI> 6. 10.</NOTE> vs <HI>to doe good vnto all men, especially to them of the house|hold of faith.</HI></P>
<P>As for <HI>ruling,</HI> we say that it is against all sense, that where the titles of rulers are giuen, there ruling should be denyed: nay Christ in the wordes immediatly fol|lowing (<HI>he that is greatest among you, let him be as the</HI>

The celestiall spirits are not equall, the starres are not equall, the disciples themselues were not in all things equall. It is not therefore Christs meaning to haue none <HI>great</HI> or <HI>chiefe</HI> among Christians, seeing our state requires necessarily that some be superiour, and other inferiour, So <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg"><HI>In Mat.</HI> 20. 26. <HI>Id<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">m Luther postil maior. in festo.

<P>Well then, if Christ here forebad neither titles of ru|lers, nor yet ruling it selfe whether it be ciuill or ecclesi|asticall: it remaines that he prohibited only <HI>so ruling,</HI> that is, such a tyrannicall kind of gouernment as the Gentile Kings vsed, and that ambitious desiring of the same which ruled in them. And indeed Christ often in the Gospell vseth to call backe those that are his from er|rors and corrupt affections by the behauiour of the Gentiles, Mat. 6. 7. <HI>The Gentiles doe thinke that by their much babling they shall be heard, bee not ye therefore like vnto them,</HI> and in the same Chapter verse 31. 32. <HI>Take no thought, saying what shall we eate or what shall wee drinke, or wherewith shall we be clothed (for after all these things seeke the Gentiles) but seeke ye first the kingdome of God,</HI> &amp;c. And that this is Christs meaning, I proue by these three reasons collected out of the context it selfe, 1. he saith Mat. 20. 25. and Marke 10. 42. <HI>Yee know that the Kings of the Gentiles,</HI> speaking of those rulers they knew, and they were tyrants and oppressors, as <HI>Pontius Pilate</HI> who condemned Christ an <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Iohn 19. 4. 16.</NOTE> innocent, in whom he found no fault; and <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Marke 6. 20. 27.</NOTE> <HI>Herod Antipas,</HI> who beheaded <HI>Iohn the Baptist</HI> (a iust and holy man whom he reueren|ced

<P>Thus haue I shewed what is said, let vs see now whom it concernes; it is certaine that Christ spake this vnto his Apostles only, but in them vnto some other re|presentatiuely; the question is then here whether hee spake representatiuely to the whole Church, that is, all Christians; or else representatiuely to the ministers of the Church only. We say with <HI>Aretius, Bucer, Mus|culus</HI> in their commentaries vpon Mat. 20. That he doth vnderstand all Christians as wel lay men as Clergy men, and this also we proue by these reasons ensuing.</P>
<P>1. Christ in this Chapter immediatly before, and also presently after, vsing this word <HI>you,</HI> and speaking vnto his Disciples and none but them (as in this place,) spea|keth vnto them as representing the whole Church and not only the Ministers, as verse 19. <HI>This is my body, which is giuen for you;</HI> and verse 20. <HI>This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you,</HI> by <HI>you,</HI> though
<PB N="79" REF="42">
it be spoken only to the Disciples, is not vnderstood the ministers only, for if Christs body were giuen, and his blood shed only for them, it would follow that none should be saued but Ministers, and that is contrary to the text <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 15.</NOTE> elsewhere <HI>Christ died for all,</HI> againe verse 29. <HI>I appoint vnto you, as my father hath appointed vnto me, a kingdome.</HI> Where by <HI>you,</HI> he meanes all true Christians of whatsoeuer estate, quality, degree: for as <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Iohn 1. 12.</NOTE> many as receiued him and beleeued in his name, to them he gaue power to be the sonnes of God, and if they be sonnes and children of God, then heires also, Rom. 8. 17. So that if thou wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> haue any part in Christ and his king|dome, then thou must also take some part of this text, thou must become as one of vs, and be numbred among these <HI>you,</HI> but ye not so.</P>
<P>2. The opposition here which is betweene <HI>Gentiles</HI> and <HI>you,</HI> doth euidently proue that it is spoken vnto the whole Church; as for example, <HI>the Kings of the Gentiles doe tyrannize ouer them,</HI> that is ouer the people: among them are Kings tyrannizing, and people tyrannized: <HI>but you not so,</HI> that is, I doe command that among you there should bee neither Kings tyrannizing, nor peo|ple tyrannized. It is thus with them, it shall not bee so with you Ministers, is no good opposition; it is thus with the Gentiles, <HI>it shall not be thus with you Chri|stians,</HI> is a full and a fit <HI>antithesis,</HI> the like whereof is found, Mat. 6. 7. 8. 31. 32. Luke 12. 29. 30. 1. Thessal. 4. 4. 5.</P>
<P>3. This place compared with that of Mat. chap. 23. vers. 8. 9. shewes plainly that it is spoken vnto the whole Church, for Christ in that place speaking of the same matter vseth a like forme of wordes, as for example, <HI>the scribes and the Pharisees are called Rabbi, &amp;c. but be not ye so called.</HI> Now that he deliuered this exhortation as well to the people as to the pastors, is apparent in the very first verse of the Chapter, <HI>then spake Iesus</HI> to the <HI>multitude, and to his Disciples.</HI> I will end this expositi|on

a rich man, a couetous rich man, a couetous rich man in a corru~pt office, <HI>Matthew the Publican.</HI> <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg"><HI>Marke</HI> 2. 14. <HI>Luke</HI> 5. 27.</NOTE> Other Euan|gelists in relating this history cals him <HI>leui,</HI> <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Hierom. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">an|sen.

<P>But the goodnes of Christ is amplifyed more by cir|cumstances of place and time, for that he called <HI>Mat|thew sitting at the receit of custome;</HI> he called <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Mat. 4. 18.</NOTE> <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Andrew</HI> while they were fishing; <HI>Iames</HI> and <HI>Iohn</HI> while they were mending their nets; hee called other, while they were doing some good, but (O the deepenes of the riches of Christs vnspeakeable mercies) hee called <HI>Matthew</HI> when he was doing hurt, executing his hate|full office, <HI>sitting at the receit of custome.</HI> <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Euthym.

For all the wicked Angels (as S. <HI>Iude</HI> teacheth in his Epistle) who left their habitation, are reserued in euerlasting chaines vnder darkenes, and such as fel not are not preferred vn|to higher place, but continue still in their first estate and dignitie, we grant that there be certaine distinctions and degrees of Angels in the quire of heauen, as reading in holy Scriptures of <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ephes.</HI> 1. 21. <HI>Coloss.</HI> 1. 16.</NOTE> <HI>principalities, and powers, &amp; thrones, and dominations, and</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><HI>Esay</HI> 6&punc; 2.</NOTE> <HI>Seraphims, and</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Gen 3 24.</NOTE> <HI>Cherubims;</HI> but we finde not in the Bible that <HI>Michael</HI> is the chiefe commander of all.

<P>2. Because the greatest Angel is vsed in the greatest embassage, but <HI>Gabriel</HI> was sent for the contracting of that sacred match betweene the blessed Virgin and the God of heauen, <HI>ergo, Gabriel</HI> is rather supreame both in naturall and supernaturall graces and prerogatiues.

The name <HI>Michael</HI> signifies <HI>quis vt Deus,</HI> who is as God, a name best agreeing vnto Christ, as being very God of very God, euen the brightnes of his glory and ingraued forme of his person, Heb. 1. 3. <HI>Michael</HI> (as we finde in the 10. and 12.

<P>So that the meaning of our text is briefly <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">August. vbi sup.</NOTE> this, Christ and his members fight against the Deuill and his com|plices: and indeede it is against the principles of holy beliefe to ascribe this victory to <HI>Michael</HI> or any other Angel whatsoeuer, seeing the Scripture saith expresly, <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Gen 3. 15.</NOTE> <HI>the seede of the woman shall breake the Serpents head, and</HI> <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Rom. 16. 20.</NOTE> <HI>the God of peace shall tread downe Satan vnder our feete,</HI> and a loud voyce from heauen proclaimes in this Chapter at the 11. verse, <HI>they ouercame the Dragon by the blood of the lambe.</HI></P>

<P>Againe it is apparent by Christs answere both in our present text, and also Mat. 20. and Luke 22.

It is reported in the 20. chapter of this Gospell, how <HI>Iames</HI> and <HI>Iohn</HI> only desired to sit on his right hand and on his left in his kingdome: yet Christ admonished them all, and said, <HI>Yee know that the Princes of the nations haue dominion ouer them, and they that are great exercise authoritie vpon them: it shall not be so with you, but whosoeuer will be chiefe among you, let him be your seruant.</HI> Now the reason why Christ, and after him his Church, vse generall admonitions in rebu|king of particular malefactors which are worse then the rest, is two-fold. First, That the delinquents may the better admit that checking which is common, and not particular or personall. 2. That such as haue not offended in that kind, may learne to be more carefull in their waies, and to hate the garment spotted by the flesh, as S. <HI>Iude</HI> speakes.

<P>Let vs examine therefore wherein we must be like to children, and wherein vnlike.

In these childish humors and the like, we may not be like to children.</P>

<P>The perillous times instant in the dayes of <HI>Paul,</HI> are become extant in our age.

Tim. 6. 3.</P>
<P>Our Bishops and pastors therefore need to be <HI>watch|full in all things, doing thoroughly the works of Euange|lists, and executing their office to the full.</HI> The patriarke <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Gen. 31. 40.</NOTE> <HI>Iacob</HI> commending his pastorall care to <HI>Laban,</HI> said, <HI>I was in the day consumed with heat, and with frost in the night, and my sleep departed from mine eyes.</HI> In which ob|serue with <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Prolog. in 2.

<P>The worlds poore are either impotent, or impudent poore: impotent by birth, or casualtie; by birth, as the fatherles orphanes, and beggars children, especially such as are creeples or borne blinde; by casualtie, as the de|cayed housholder, the maymed souldier, the visited with any grieuous plague or sicknes: all these kindes of poore wretches are to be relieued as wel with our almes as ad|uise.

<P>Of Rogues, I meane vagabond idle persons, out of couenant, out of course, there be two sortes, as namely, wild rogues so bred, a great part whereof is an vncir|cumcised generation, vnbaptized, out of the Church, and so consequently <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Ephes. 2. 12.</NOTE> without God in the world.

<P>There be three ranks of the Deuils poore.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>Couetous.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Vaine-glorious.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Superstitious.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The Couetous, who want euen that they haue, being as they are termed aptly the greatest <HI>Misers</HI> in the world, like the market horse laden with daintie cates, and yet feeds on thistles.</P>
<P>The vaine-glorious, who to get a name, forget often their estate, as certaine Philosophers in old time (whom I will not name, because they did it for a name) cast all their goods into the Sea, least they should hinder their courses in the studies of philosophie. <HI>Nolebant censu abundare terreno, vt magis sensu abundarent suo,</HI> saith a <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Iansen. con|cord. cap. 39.</NOTE> learned expositor vpon this text. And certaine Schis|matickes in latter ages, haue for the crasie credite of a desperate cause forsaken their owne Countreys, and their owne free-holds which were certaine, to depend vpon the breath and bread of other men which is vn|certaine.</P>
<P>The Superstitious, as the popish Monks and Friars, who transported with a blind deuotion, abandoned all worldly possessions, and yet abounded in all riot and ex|cesse; <HI>Regulares gulares,</HI> they were more then men at their meat, lesse then women at their worke, saith <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">In coll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> franciscan.</NOTE> <HI>Eras|mus.</HI>

<P>So then (as you see) the Deuils poore differ verie much one from another: for the Couetous haue the pos|session; but not the free vse: the Superstitious haue the vse, but not the free possession: the Vaine-glorious vpon the point haue neither free vse, nor free possession of such worldly wealth as they desire, being all in their seuerall kinds exceeding poore.</P>
<P>The third sort of poore are Gods poore, which a|bound with inward wants, and want also many times outward aboundance. Where of some vndergoe pati|ently losse of their goods, as <HI>Iob;</HI> other forgoe cheer|fully the vse of their goods, as the blessed Apostles. These are <HI>the poore in spirit,</HI> or (as <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">In regulis con|tracti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ribus quaest. 205. Idem Beza in loco.</NOTE> S. <HI>Basile</HI> construeth it) <HI>the poore for the spirit,</HI> wholy submitting themselues to be ruled by Gods holie spirit, the humble and the meeke, truly feeling their inward, and patiently bearing their outward pouerty. Christ then here doth not vn|derstand such as are meerely <HI>the worlds poore;</HI> for albeit they be humbled, yet are they not humble; nor <HI>the de|uils poore,</HI> for they are neither actually humbled nor humble; but only <HI>Gods poore,</HI> which are both humbled and humble, humbled in their pouerty, humble in their spirit, <HI>blessed are the poore in spirit.</HI></P>

<PB N="141" REF="73">
<HI>thought and mind.</HI> So that to be <HI>poore in spirit,</HI> is nothing else, but willingly to<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Mat. 16. 24.</NOTE> forsake our selues, and to follow Christ, euermore being readie for his sake to beare the losse of our wealth, when as we are made poore; and to forbeare the vse of our wealth, when as we are rich, <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. 31.</NOTE> vsing the world as though we vsed it not. For this blessing belongs as well to the rich, as to the poore. As the bad poore are proud in spirit; so the good rich are poore in spirit. <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Ardens hom. in loc.</NOTE> As some be poore in substance, and not in spirit; so some rich in substance, yet poore in spi|rit.

<P>The worlds poore are miserable, because deiected in their pouertie: The deuils poore cursed, because proud&punc; in their pouertie: Gods poore only blessed, as hauing nothing, and yet possessing all things, 2. Cor. 6. 10.</P>
<P>Here then obserue what an excellent vertue conten|tation and lowlinesse of minde is. As the first vice the Deuill thrust vpon <HI>Adam</HI> was discontentment and pride: So the first vertue Christ commends vnto his fol|lowers, is an humble contentment. The eight beati|tudes (saith <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ser. de</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">. <HI>Bea|tud.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Cromatius</HI>) are like <HI>Iacobs</HI> ladder, reaching from earth vnto Heauen; and the verie first step of the ladder as the <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Theophylact. in loc.</NOTE> foundation of the rest is lowlinesse of mind. For as God is said to <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Iob 26. 7.</NOTE> hang the earth vpon no|thing, that it might wholie depend vpon him: euen so doth he found the world of his Christian common|wealth vpon nothing; and this nothing is an humble dis-prising and forsaking of all our owne abilities, and an only relying vpon his almightie power and good|nesse.
