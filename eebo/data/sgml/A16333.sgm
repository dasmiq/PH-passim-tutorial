<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL, FRANCIS NICOLLS Esquire, one of His Majesties <HI>Iustices of Peace and Quorum,</HI> for the County of NORTHAMPTON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IT was the desire of this reverend <HI>Au|thor,</HI> when that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">A quarian a|gue.</NOTE> furious messenger of Death first seized upon his spirits, gi|ving him no more intermission, than what would serve for some feeble pre|parations against a <HI>New Encounter:</HI> that I would, in case he died, (which afterwards lamen|tably fell out) frame an Epistle to this Worke which he had then made ready for the Presse; and dedicate it (in his name) to your selfe, as a pledge of his avowed thankfulnesse for those many favours he received from that religious and renowned <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Iustice <HI>Ni|colls,</HI> as grave and learned a Iudge a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> this Kingdome c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">|joyed in the age it held him.</NOTE> Iudge, his noble Pa|tron: and from your selfe, his immediate heire and suc|cessour.</P>
<P>This request from him (that would deny me nothing)
<PB REF="3">
I knew not how to with-stand, though I wrong'd my selfe in the acceptance; as to draw a <HI>line</HI> in that Worke, from which so rare a Work-man had taken off his lear|ned and eloquent pen. But yet a necessity lay upon me; for he desired in his sicknesse, that by this Dedication it might appeare to the world how much he honoured your selfe and family, which first preferred him.</P>
<P>It was no small joy to his heart to see that speech of God himselfe fulfilled upon your <HI>House, Those that ho|nour</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 2. 30.</NOTE> <HI>me I will honour.</HI> It is fit the world should know (that it may blush and mend) to what eminency of place the meere merits of <HI>Iustice Nicolls</HI> in that short race of his life rais'd him unto. Called he was by the Writt of <HI>Queene ELIZABETH</HI> to be <HI>Serjeant at Law:</HI> He was by <HI>King IAMES</HI> made <HI>Serjeant at Law</HI> to <HI>Prince HENRY</HI> his eldest Sonne: <HI>Iudge</HI> of the Com|mon Pleas, and <HI>Chancellour</HI> to our (now) gracious So|veraigne, when he was <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Wales.</HI> But that which truly ennobles his memory, and makes me call to mind what our <HI>Fleta</HI> reporteth was the honour of Iudges a|bout <HI>King EDWARD</HI> the first's dayes: He had and held all these places <HI>Nec prece, nec</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Qui pecu|nia &amp; largiti|onibus hono|res sacerdotia &amp; magistratus ambiunt, his poena deporta|tionis est prae|stituta. <HI>Lex Iul. de ambitu.</HI></NOTE> <HI>pretio, nec praemio.</HI> I am not afraid to english it, for I well know the truth of it: <HI>He neither begged them, nor bought them, nor gaue</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iustice of Peace&mdash;and Quorum, Iu|stice of Oyer Oyer and Termi|ner, Knight of the Shire, High Sheriff of the County.</NOTE> <HI>so much as a New-yeares-gift for them.</HI></P>
<P>The like I can truly speake of your selfe; Those dig|nities which have been cast upon you in your owne Country (since he was taken to glory) which are neither few nor meane: they came to you, you sued not for them; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Honor fu|gientem sequi|tur, sequentem fugit.</NOTE> you sought them not: Nay, you degraded your selfe of one of them (a thing not usuall) by making ear|nest suit to be out of the Commission of <HI>Oyer</HI> and <HI>Termi|ner,</HI> after you had a while endur'd it.</P>
<P>From hence (as I have good ground to conceive) would this worthy Author have mounted you up on Eagles wings to the Throne of the Highest, who hath<NOTE PLACE="marg">I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">y. 40. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE> done these and greater things for you, and have prest

upon you large and highe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> performances. If ever there were a time for <HI>Righteous men</HI> that are in authority to shew themselues, the time is now come. Meane Chri|stians, their very persons and actions are by the abound|ing of sinne become a very <HI>Parable of Reproach; A com|pany of Block-heads,</HI> as a <HI>melancholy Diuine</HI> cals them. If those therefore that are in place should now be silent, it is pitie but their breaths should be stopt for ever. I have observed it long, and not without wonder, (looking upon former times) that in these dayes such a spirit of feare and faintnesse hath possessed the hearts of holy men, that they dare not be couragious in the cause of God. It is no strange thing for a man to be fearfull in the <HI>Darke:</HI> but when such a light shines upon us from heaven, as that our eyes are euen dazelled in the behold|ing<NOTE PLACE="marg">Degeneres animos timor arguit.</NOTE> of it; now to be timerous, now to be faint-hearted in a good cause for feare of men, or any such ignoble re|spect;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 146. 3, 4.</NOTE> is <HI>monstrous Cowardize.</HI> What is there in the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nec Christi|ani ultr&agrave; dura|re aut esse pos|sumus, si ad hoc ventum est ut perdito|rum minas at|&abque; insidias per|timesca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">us. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> <HI>Cypr.

What is outward preferment, to the losse, or certaine hazard of a good conscience? For, they are rarely kept together: what are mockings, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">re|vilings, reproches, imprisonment, &amp;c. to godly men? but deeper impressions of stricter holinesse, and the very <HI>markes of the Lord Iesus.</HI></P>
<P>The name of <HI>Christian</HI> is a name both of <HI>Honour and</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Oportuit in divinis ca|stris milites CHRISTI: ut non mi|nae terreant nec cruciatus &amp; tormenta de|vincant. <HI>Cyp. lib.</HI> 2. <HI>Cap.</HI> 6.</NOTE> <HI>Valour,</HI> and begets better spirits then either <HI>Romane</HI> or <HI>Grecian;</HI> let <HI>Machiauell</HI> and other <HI>Atheists</HI> say what they will: which of their stories euer made mention of so valiant an army, as that <HI>Noble Army</HI> of Martyrs, men|tioned in the 11^t^h. Chapter to the <HI>Hebrewes?</HI> How can they want spirit that deriue their courage from no lesse Author than the Lion of the Tribe of Iuda. Nay, it were no hard matter to proue, (might I recede from an Epi|stle, to pursue a Common place) That no man can be tru|ly valorous; but he that is truly religious.</P>

<P>As this Courage ought to be in all that feare God: so specially in those that are Magistrates, and sit in the seats of <HI>Iustice,</HI> the very Tribunals of God himselfe: For them to be dastardly and fearefull, is to shame their Ma|ster. Give me therefore leave, by some warrant from the Author, in your person (whom I cannot but com|mend in this particular) to presse this virtue upon all that beare rule in their Country. It is part of the <HI>Essence</HI> of a <HI>Iustice of Peace,</HI> to be a man of Courage. The coun|sell of <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">thro</HI> to <HI>Moses,</HI> was, to make onely such to be<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 18.</NOTE> Magistrates, as were <HI>men of</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or, <HI>able men,</HI> in the last <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">|slation.</NOTE> <HI>courage, fearing God,</HI> &amp;c. Wherein the Spirit of God preferres the daughter be|fore the mother, and <HI>Fortitude</HI> before the <HI>Feare of God,</HI> of which it is the effect, because it is more conspicuous in the eyes of men: For the feare of God is a thing hidden i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> the heart, but that which drawes it forth and makes it illustrious, is that valour and high resolution of spirit by which it worketh. Almighty God makes this good by an example of his owne choice. For when he had appointed <HI>Ioshua</HI> to succeed <HI>Moses,</HI> and had mighti|ly supported his mind with arguments of his owne assi|stance and presence with him, he requires nothing else of him, but to be <HI>strong and of a good courage,</HI> with many i|terations of the same thing in such phrases as these, <HI>Be</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iosh. 1. 6, 7, 9, 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">.</NOTE> <HI>strong and of a good courage,</HI> be <HI>very couragious, be not a|fraid, be not dismaid:</HI> And, as if there were no other vir|tue desireable in a Magistrate, the people (in accepting him for their Captaine) require of him no other conditi|on but this, <HI>Onely be strong, and of a good courage.</HI> And the Law of this Land, which in this, as in most other things, is parallell with the Law of God, (as I could shew) would onely haue those <HI>Iustices</HI> of <HI>Peace,</HI> which are the most <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Stat.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">4. <HI>E.</HI> 3. <HI>Cap.</HI> 1. <HI>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> the old Stat. at large.</HI></NOTE> <HI>valiant men</HI> of the County.</P>
<P>I speake not this to exclude all those requisites of wis|dome that ought to be in the holiest and most valiant men. I may say in these times as the Apostle said of a|nother virtue, <HI>There is great need of wisdome.</HI> The chil|dren<NOTE PLACE="marg">H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">b. 10. 36.</NOTE>

of God ever haue beene, still are, and ever may be the wisest men upon earth. Let an unwise world think what it list. I meane not that wisdome (falsly so called) whereby a generation of men to save their skinnes, han|dle a good cause like a Venice-glasse, loath they are to do any thing that may offend great persons with whom they would comply: or expose themselves to any dan|ger or losse. (The very wisdome which caused <HI>Francis Spira</HI> to despaire.) This is rather cunning or craft: or, to linke them together in the language of the Apostle, <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Ephes. 4. 14.</NOTE> <HI>A cunning craftinesse,</HI> it is not wisdome. True wis|dome in the morall Schooles of Philosophy, and in the purer Schooles of Divinity, is that Queene of virtues, which like the soule in the body giveth life and <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Anima est tota in toto, &amp; tota in quali|bet parte.</NOTE> <HI>infor|mation</HI> to all the rest, commands all the affections, regu|lates all the actions of mans life, and adds an active quickning power to every virtue, to every faculty in man, directing them to a blessed issue. So that a wise man is a <HI>valiant</HI> man, a <HI>just</HI> man, a <HI>temperate</HI> man, an <HI>humble</HI> man, &amp;c.

and <HI>Love</HI> hath made me long in this argument, and must now be my excuse.

<P>What you heard him speake, you saw him practice.

<HEAD>THE LIFE AND DEATH OF M^r. <HI>BOLTON.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THat one age may tell ano|ther, that the memoriall of the just shall be ever blessed, when the per|sons and names of those that are otherwise min|ded shall rot and vanish away: It hath beene the pious custome of ancient and later times, to commend to posterity the eminent graces of the Saints depar|ted. Famous are those Panegyricke Orations made at the tombes of the Mar|tyrs in the Primitive times; when as their persecuting Emperours, priding themselves in their lamentable deaths, have left no o|ther
<PB REF="9">
noyse behind them, than the loud and long continued cries of spilling innocent bloud.</P>
<P>Memorable also are the Funerall Orati|ons of the two <HI>Gregories, Nyssen</HI> and <HI>Nazi|anzen</HI> on <HI>Basill</HI> the great: And in later times, to give a few instances, (for the number in this kinde is infinite) <HI>Melancthon</HI> and <HI>Came|rarius</HI> wrote the life of <HI>Martyn Luther; Iuni|us</HI> the life of <HI>Vrsine; Beza</HI> the life of <HI>Calvin; Antonius Faius</HI> the life of <HI>Beza; Iosias Sim|ler</HI> the life of <HI>Peter Martyr;</HI> and D^r. <HI>Hum|phrey</HI> the life of our most renowned <HI>Iewell.</HI></P>
<P>This manner of honouring the Saints is warranted by GODS owne example; who (for ought is revealed to us) tooke order for <HI>Moses</HI> buriall, digged his grave, covered him with molds, and made for him that ex|cellent Funerall Sermon expressed in the first Chapter of <HI>Ioshuah.</HI> And that all-wise GOD who sweetly disposeth all things, thinkes it needfull thus to grace his owne people, that he may hereby uphold their spirits amid those many pressures, scornes, reproaches, <HI>cruell mockings,</HI> and innumerable

other miseries which they endure of the world, meerely for his service; be they o|therwise never so wise, just, meeke, peacea|ble, and unrebukeable amongst men: Wit|nesse those many terrible persecutions (men|tioned<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Euseb Hist.

<P>According to these examples, and for the<NOTE PLACE="marg">3</NOTE> very same causes, I have adventured to publish to the world, the life and death of
<PB REF="10">
this man of GOD the Authour of this Work, now a Saint in heaven. I confesse his worth and parts deserved rather an advance|ment by some such eloquent Orators as I mentioned before, than a depression by my pen; but yet a pearle may be shewed forth as well by a weake hand, as by the arme of a gyant, I shall do no more. And let his owne worth and workes praise him in the gates. I knew him from the beginning of my youth, being my first Tutour in the Vni|versitie of <HI>Oxford,</HI> and my selfe one of his first Schollers, and from that time to the day of his death, being above seven and twenty yeares, none knew him better, or lo|ved him more; our familiarity was such, that (alluding to that betweene <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Ti|mothy</HI>)<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Tim. 1, 4.</NOTE> I may say, I knew his doctrine, man|ner of life, faith, charity, patience; and now will onely relate what I have heard and seene, wherein I will not exceed the bounds of modesty or truth.</P>
<P>To begin with his birth; I observe that<NOTE PLACE="marg">4</NOTE> throughout the sacred Bible, and writings on the persons of holy men, their places of
<PB REF="10">
birth are ever remembred; GOD loves the very ground his servants tread on: <HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>shall count</HI> (sayes <HI>David) when he</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 87. 6.</NOTE> <HI>numbreth up the people, that this man was borne there;</HI> whereas of other men there shall be no remembrance of them, they shall have none to lament or bury them, but shall be cast forth as dung on the face of the earth: so that I may say of them, as was said of Pope <HI>Boniface</HI> the eight, famous for nothing but his wickednesse; <HI>intravit vul|pes, regnavit leo, exivit canis;</HI> the Prophet <HI>David</HI> renders it thus in plaine English. <HI>They spend their daies in mirth, and suddenly go downe into hell.</HI></P>
<P>He was borne at <HI>Blackborne</HI> a towne of<NOTE PLACE="marg">5</NOTE> good note in <HI>Lancashire</HI> on Whitsunday,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camb. Brit. pag. 752.</NOTE> <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1572. His parents being not of any great meanes, yet finding in him a great towardlinesse for learning, destinated him to be a scholler, and strugled with their estate to furnish him with necessaries in that kind, apprehending the advantage of a sin|gular Schoole-master that was then in the<NOTE PLACE="marg">M^r. Yates.</NOTE> towne. He plied his booke so well, that in
<PB REF="11">
short time he became the best scholler in the schoole: and no marvell; for, he had those sixe properties of a scholler noted by <HI>Isocrates</HI> and others, which concurring in<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> one, thrust up learning to a very high ele|vation.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. He was (<GAP DESC="foreign">) of excellent parts and abilities of mind, and of a sound constituti|on of body.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. He was (<GAP DESC="foreign">) of a very strong me|mory; I meane such a memory as was no|tably actuated by his ready and quicke un|derstanding. For, (as Philosophers ob|serve) that memory which tends to admira|tion, being of a quite differing temperature from the understanding, inclines rather to folly, and becomes the ground of that Pro|verbe, <HI>The greatest Clerkes are not alwaies the wisest men.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. He was (<GAP DESC="foreign">) a moover of doubts and questions; this was ever an evident signe of learning; by this our blessed Savi|our approoved His learning amongst the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk 2. 46.</NOTE> Doctours in hearing them and asking them questions: So did the Queene of <HI>Shebah</HI> to

<ITEM>4. He was (<GAP DESC="foreign">) a speciall lover of learning; it was alwayes his delight to exer|cise himselfe in studies, and would not en|dure any aversions from them, as shall be hereafter shewed.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. He was (<GAP DESC="foreign">) a very laborious pain|full student, as shall be more largely shewed, for it is worthy imitation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. He was (<GAP DESC="foreign">) a great listner after the sayings and speeches of others, and hath beene often observed to be onely a hearer, and to sit silent himselfe, unlesse he was urged with some importunity, and the things he heard, he suffered them not to be lost, (if they were of worth) but alwayes put them downe in a booke which he particu|larly kept for that purpose.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>He continued long at schoole, and came<NOTE PLACE="marg">6</NOTE> not to the Vniversity till about the twenti|eth<NOTE PLACE="marg">His studies in Lincolne Col|ledge.</NOTE> yeare of his age. He was placed at <HI>Ox|ford</HI> in <HI>Lincolne Colledge</HI> under the tuition of M^r. <HI>Randall,</HI> a man of no great note then, but
<PB REF="12">
afterward became a learned Divine and godly Preacher at <HI>London.</HI> In that Colledge he fell close to the studies of Logick and Philosophie, and by reason of that ground|worke of learning he got at schoole, and ma|turity of yeares, he quickly got the start of those of his owne time, and grew into fame in that House. In the middest of these his studies his father died, and then his meanes failed, for all his fathers lands fell to his el|der brother now living: but this crosse by GODS providence prooved a great advan|tage to him for his growth in learning, though it put him to monstrous paines of body and mind: for now wanting meanes to buy him bookes, he borrowed of his Tu|tour and others the best writers on Naturall and Morall Philosophy, and the Politicks, and read them all over, and abridged them all in his note-bookes, which are now to be seene, and then returned the bookes to their owners. Nay such a desire he had to at|taine a perfection in the things he studied, that though he was very well skilled in the Greeke tongue, yet that he might attaine an
<PB REF="12">
exactnesse in it, he did with intolerable pains write out with his owne hand all <HI>Homer,</HI> (or <HI>Hesiod</HI> I am sure) for I have seene it in a faire Greeke character; for he wrote that lan|guage better than he did either English or Latine; and asking him the reason of his paines, he told me, it was onely that he might accent perfectly. This brought him to such a readinesse, that he could with as much facility <HI>course</HI> in the publike Schooles (for he was a famous disputant) in the Greeke tongue, as in the Latine or English: and in them all he wrote and spake <HI>Stilo im|peratorio,</HI> as <HI>Lipsius</HI> calls it, <HI>viz.</HI> a high and lofty stile, which was so familiar to him, as that he could not avoid it in ordinary con|ference.</P>
<P>From <HI>Lincolne Colledge</HI> he remooved to<NOTE PLACE="marg">7</NOTE> <HI>Brasen-nose:</HI> For, by the Founders of that<NOTE PLACE="marg">In Brasen-nose Colledge.</NOTE> House most of the Fellowships therein were ordained for <HI>Lancashire</HI> and <HI>Cheshire</HI> men, but comming to that Colledge, having but few friends, he stayed long without a Fellow-ship&punc; about which time (that I may not bu|ry in silence the charitable acts of such men
<PB REF="13">
whom their learning and piety have made eminent) it pleased M^r. D^r. <HI>Bret,</HI> knowing<NOTE PLACE="marg">A man of sirgu|lar <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> for learning and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE> his deserts, and perceiving him to languish for want of meanes, most bountifully to contribute for his reliefe, and by his and o|thers bounty, with some small stipends he had for his Lectures in that House, he was upheld untill he had got a Fellowship, which fell out about the thirtieth yeare of his age, at which time he commenced Master of Arts; and then by the Exercises he perfor|med in the House and abroad, being Re|gent-Master he grew into fame, and was still successively chosen to be Reader of the Le|ctures of Logick, and Morall, and Naturall Philosophy, (as by the Statutes of the House they were appointed to be read) which he performed so strictly, and with such exact|nesse, as that he got credit and applause with the best, but some envy with his successours, that by his example were now provoked to a more frequent and painfull reading of them, which were seldome and sleightly performed before. And such was his e|steeme in the Vniversitie for his publike dis|putations,
<PB REF="13">
which he ever performed with such readinesse and acutenesse of speech and wit, and such profoundnesse of learning, that when he was a Master of Arts but of small standing, he was chosen by the now <HI>Lord Arch-Bishop of Canterburie, Vice-Chancel|lour</HI> at King IAMES His first comming to that Vniversity, to be one of the disputants before the King, and to read in Naturall Philosophy in the publike Schooles. Besides his knowledge in Logick and Philosophy, wherein he excelled, he was also well study|ed in the Metaphysicks and Mathematicks, and in all Schoole-Divinity, especially in <HI>Thomas Aquinas,</HI> which he had read over once or twice, and had exactly noted him throughout, as may appeare in his notes.</P>
<P>But all this while though he was <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">I may tru|ly say of him, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> <HI>Tertullian</HI> of Irenaeus, That he was <HI>curio|sissimus omni|um doctrina|rum explora|tor.</HI></NOTE> very<NOTE PLACE="marg">8</NOTE> learned, yet he was not good, he was a very meane scholler in the schoole of CHRIST, he drew no religious breath from the soyle he came, and his master like an ill seedsman sowed the tares of Popery in most of his schollers: this manner of education made him more apt to tread in any path than that
<PB REF="14">
which was holy; he loved Stage-playes, <HI>cards and dice, he was a horrible swearer and sabbath-breaker, and boone-companion,</HI> and was ever glad (as I have heard him say) of <HI>Christmas-holy dayes,</HI> and marvellous me|lancholie when they were ended, he loved not goodnesse nor good men, and of all sorts of people could not abide their com|pany that were of a strict and holy conversa|tion, such he would fetch within the com|passe of <HI>Puritans,</HI> thinking that by that law|lesse name he had deprived them <HI>ipso facto</HI> both of learning and good religion. Such a generall scorne hath this degenerate age put upon the wayes of GOD, that the name of <HI>Puritan</HI> which is truly and properly the name of the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Euseb.

<PB REF="14">
plaine but very sound and substantiall preaching meeting at once in him with a curious palate and unsanctified heart; quite turned his stomacke against that <HI>good man</HI> that he thought him (to speake in his owne phrase) <HI>a barren empty fellow, and a passing meane scholler.</HI> I have heard many of late (much of M^r. <HI>Boltons</HI> temper in goodnesse at that time, but inferiour in learning) speak the like of M^r. <HI>Perkins;</HI> but the eminent learning of that man (famous <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><HI>Willlelmus Perkinsus do|ctissimus theolo|gus. Keck. Syst. Pol. lib.</HI> 1. <HI>p.</HI> 208.</NOTE> abroad as well as at home) is so farre above their reach; that to <HI>traduce</HI> his worth is to <HI>que|stion</HI> their owne. And that late learned <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">D^r. <HI>Abbot</HI> in his reply to Bi|shop.</NOTE> <HI>Bishop of Salisbury</HI> in the defence of his booke against the cavils of D^r. <HI>Bishop,</HI> hath in many places amply commended his lear|ning. So that the precious name of M^r. <HI>Perkins</HI> shall like an ointment powred forth, fill all the quarters of this land with a fresh and fragrant sweetnesse, when nothing shall survive of his <HI>Detractors,</HI> but their unsavou|ry and unlearned spight against so holy a man. And M^r. <HI>Bolton</HI> himselfe when GOD changed his heart (which I will next write
<PB REF="15">
of) he changed his opinion of M^r. <HI>Perkins,</HI> and thought him as learned and godly a Divine as our Church hath for many yeares enjoyed in so <NOTE PLACE="marg">He was but little aboue 40 yeares old when he died</NOTE> young a man: But I pro|ceed.</P>
<P>When he was of <HI>Brasen-nose Colledge,</HI> he<NOTE PLACE="marg">9</NOTE> had familiar acquaintance with one Mr. <HI>An|derton</HI> his country-man, and sometime his schoole-fellow, a very good scholler, but a strong Papist, and now a Popish Priest, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">His connersion</NOTE> one of the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">He was for his eloquence called <HI>Golden mouthed Ander|ton</HI> when he was but a <HI>Schollar.</HI></NOTE> learnedest amongst them: This man well knowing the good parts that were in M^r. <HI>Bolton,</HI> and perceiving that he was in some outward wants, tooke this advantage, and used many arguments to perswade him to be reconciled to the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and to go over with him to the English Semina|ry, telling him he should be furnished with all necessaries, and should have gold e|nough (one of the best arguments to allure an unstable mind to Popery). M^r. <HI>Bolton</HI> be|ing at that time poore in minde and Purse, accepted of the motion, and a day, &amp; place was appointed in <HI>Lancashire,</HI> where they should meet, and from thence take ship|ping
<PB REF="15">
and be gone. M^r. <HI>Bolton</HI> met at the day and place, but M^r. <HI>Anderton</HI> came not, and so he escaped that snare, and soone after returned to <HI>Brasen-nose,</HI> where falling into the acquaintance of one M^r. <HI>Peacocke</HI> Fel|low of that House, a learned and godly man, it pleased GOD by his acquaintance to frame upon his soule that admirable workmanship of his repentance and conver|sion to eternall life, but by such a way of working as the LORD seldome useth but upon such strong vessels which in his singu|lar wisdome he intendeth afterward for strong incounters, and rare imployments. The first newes he heard of GOD was not by any soft and still voice, but in terrible tempests and thunder, the LORD running upon him as a gyant, taking him by the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob 16. ver. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">, 13, 14.</NOTE> necke and shaking him to peeces, as he did <HI>Iob;</HI> beating him to the very ground, as he did <HI>Paul,</HI> by laying before him the ugly vi|sage of his sins which lay so heavy upon him, as he roared for griefe of heart, and so af|frighted him, as I have heard him say, he rose out of his bed in the night for
<PB REF="16">
very anguish of spirit. And to augment his spirituall misery, he was exercised with fowle temptations, <HI>horribilia de</HI> DEO, <HI>terribi|lia de fide,</HI> which <HI>Luther</HI> called <HI>Colaphum Sata|nae,</HI> for as he was parallell with <HI>Luther</HI> in <HI>ma|ny</HI> things as I shall shew anon: so was he in these spirituall temptations which were so vehement upon <HI>Luther,</HI> that the very ve|nome of them dranke up his spirits, and his body seemed dead, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">In his Epi|stle to Melan|cthon.</NOTE> <HI>Vt nec calor, nec sanguis, nec sensus, nec vox superesset,</HI> that neither speech, sense, bloud or heat appeared in him, as <HI>Iustas Ionas</HI> that was by and saw it, report|eth of him: but this sharpe fit of <HI>Luthers</HI> lasted but for one day, but M^r. <HI>Boltons</HI> conti|nued for many moneths, but yet GOD gave him at length a blessed issue, and these grie|vous pangs in his spirituall birth produced two admirable effects in him (as well as in <HI>Luther</HI>) which many times ensue upon such <HI>hard labour,</HI> an invincible courage and reso|lution for the cause of GOD, in the which he feared no colours, not the face or force of any; secondly, a singular dexterity in com|forting afflicted and wounded spirits, as
<PB REF="16">
shall be likewise further shewed.</P>
<P>Vpon this he resolved to enter into the<NOTE PLACE="marg">10</NOTE> Ministery, and about the thirty fift yeare of his age was ordained Minister, after which he wholly applied him selfe to the worke of the Ministry, and improoved all his lear|ning and time to that excellent end: A little while after he was in the Ministry, he was by meanes made knowne to M^r. <HI>Iustice Nicolls,</HI> at that time <HI>Serjeant at Law,</HI> who observing the comlinesse of his person and the stuffe that was in him, had it alwayes in his thoughts to advance him, and about the thirty seventh yeare of M^r. <HI>Boltons</HI> age, the personage of <HI>Broughton</HI> in <HI>Northampton shire</HI> falling void, he did by my hand send for him from the <HI>Vniversity</HI> to his chamber at <HI>Serjeants Inne,</HI> and presented him to that li|ving, at which time D^r. <HI>King</HI> late <HI>Bishop of London</HI> being then by accident at the Iudges chamber, thanked him for M^r. <HI>Bol|ton,</HI> but told him withall, that he had depri|ved the <HI>Vniversity</HI> of a singular Ornament&punc; Then did he put out his first booke, contai|ning <HI>A discourse of true happinesse,</HI> which he
<PB REF="17">
dedicated to <HI>Serjeant Nicolls</HI> his patron, which for the godlinesse of the matter, and cloquence of the stile therein contained, was universally bought up, and divers have con|fessed, that at first bought it out of curiosity, for some sweet relish in the Phrase, tooke CHRIST to boote and thereby tooke the first beginning of their heavenly tast.</P>
<P>About the fortieth yeare of his age, for<NOTE PLACE="marg">11</NOTE> the better setting of himselfe in house-kee|ping vpon his Personage, he resolued vpon marriage, and tooke to wife M^r^s. <HI>Anne Boyse</HI> a Gentle woman of an ancient house and worshipfull family in <HI>Kent,</HI> to whose care he committed the ordering of his outward estate, he himselfe onely minding the stu|dies and weighty affaires of his heauenly calling, in the which for the space of twen|ty yeares and more, he was so diligent and laborious, that twice every Lords day hee preached, and Catechized in the After|noone, in which Catechisme he expounded the Creed and ten Commandements in a very exact manner; And vpon every holy|day, and on euery friday before the Sacra|ment
<PB REF="17">
he expounded some Chapter, by which meanes he went over the greater portion of the Historicall part of the Old and New Te|stament. And in them all, as was well obser|ved by a learned and graue <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">M^r. Estwick in his Sermon at his funerall.</NOTE> Divine that preached at his funerall, he prepared no|thing for his people but what might have served a learned Auditory, and in all his preachings he still aimed next to the glory of God at the Conversion of soules, the ve|ry crowne and glory of a good Minister at the appearing of that great day: and herein GOD wonderfully honoured his Ministery in making him an aged father in CHRIST, and to beget many sonnes and daughters vnto righteousnesse; for I may truely say, many hundreds were either absolutely converted, or mightily confirmed, or singularly comfor|ted in their grievous agonies by his Mini|stery: for he had such an art in this kinde of relieving afflicted consciences, which hee acquired, partly by great paines and industry in searching into that skill, but chiefly by that manifold experience he had in himselfe and others, that he was sought to
<PB REF="18">
farre and neare, and divers from beyond the seas desired his resolution in divers cases of Conscience, which was the onely cause that made him put forth that last learned and godly Treatise of his, which he stiled; <HI>In|structions for a right comforting afflicted consci|ences.</HI></P>
<P>And though in his manner of preaching<NOTE PLACE="marg">12</NOTE> he was a <HI>Sonne of thunder,</HI> yet unto bruised reeds and those that mourned in spirit, hee was as sweete a sonne of Consolation as ever I heard, and with a very tender and pitifull heart powred the oyle of mercy into their bleeding wounds. He (as was said of <HI>Lu|ther</HI>) was a mighty opposite to the Divels kingdome, and had a singular skill to dis|cerne his sleights and that cunning crafti|nesse whereby hee lies in wait to deceive. He ever thought that there was no such way to cast downe the strong holds of Sathan and to batter his kingdome, then after the steps of <HI>Iohn the Baptist,</HI> to lay the axe close to the roote of sinne, and to set it on with such power, as that the Divell and all his a|gents were not able to resist it. By this meanes
<PB REF="18">
he got ground of Satan and wasted his king|dome, and <HI>there were daily added to his Mini|stery such whose hearts were softned thereby.</HI> And in all his Sermons he ever used to discover the filthinesse of sinne, and to presse very powerfully upon the conscience the duties of Sanctification, in expression whereof three things were remarkeable in him.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Such courage and resolution of spirit as is scarcely to be found in any. I am per|swaded that in the cause of GOD he could have beene contented with <HI>Martin Luther, totius mundi odium &amp; impetum sustinere; to have undergone the rage and violence of the whole world,</HI> whereby he gave such vigour unto the truth he delivered, that it pierced betweene the very joynts and the mar|row.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Impartiality; he would spare none in their sinnes either great or small, he knew he was to deliver his Masters will, with whom was no respect of persons.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. His wisedome; as he was of high cou|rage, so was it excellently tempered with wis|dome, descryed in these foure things. 1. In
<PB REF="19">
all his denunciations against sinne, he never personated any man whereby to put him to shame, unlesse his owne inward guiltinesse caused him to apply it to himselfe. 2. Hee would never presse upon the conscience the guiltinesse of sinne, but he would for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ifie it by Scripture, by the ancient Fathers (in which he was ripe and ready) and the concurrence of the best Orthodoxe Writers, to stop the mouth of all slanderers that should accuse his doctrine, either of novelty or of too much precisenesse. 3. When he had searcht the conscience to the very quicke (as he would doe) he ever offred CHRIST in all his beauty and sweetnesse, and powred it forth upon the conscience with such a torrent of Eloquence as would haue melted the hearts of any, but those which obstinately refused the voice of that powerfull charmer. 4. He would alwaies protest unto his people, that it was a trouble and griefe to him to preach against their sinnes, hee delighted not to vexe any of their consciences, he should be glad the case was so with them, that hee might only preach the riches of the mercies
<PB REF="19">
in CHRIST all his dayes; But he knew no other way to pull them out of the snare of Satan and state of darkenesse then the way he tooke, without drawing the horrible sin of Bloud-guiltinesse upon his soule.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>But that which made his preaching more illustrious, was that burning and shining light which appeared in his life and conver|sation in these five particulars.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Piety.</NOTE></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. His Piety, wherein I need not say much, for that second booke of his concerning <HI>di|rections for walking with</HI> GOD, were framed out of the pious Meditations of his owne heart as a guide for himselfe for the orde|ring of his steps in the waies of righteous|nes, which he so strictly observed throughout the course of his life that (allowing to him his frailties and <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Et cert&egrave; ea est semper&abque; suit hominum om|nium etiam piorum &amp; Chistianorum vita, vt semper etiam in opti|mis &amp; castissi|mis moribus tamen aliquid possis desidera|re. <HI>Iewel.

<PB REF="20">
up thither by the wings of prayer. His con|stant course was to pray sixe times a day, twice by himselfe in private, twice in pub|lique with his family, and twice with his wife. Besides, many daies of private humi|liation and prayer ever before the receiving of the Communion, and many daies be|sides, for the miseries of the Churches in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Germany, &amp;c&punc;</HI> which he performed with such ardencie of spirit, that as was said<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tria faciunt Theologum; Oratio, medi|tatio, tentatio. <HI>Luther&punc; T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s.

<PB REF="20">
that being advised by Physitians for his healths sake, to breake off the strong inten|tions of his studies; he rejected their coun|sell, accounting it greater riches to enjoy CHRIST by those fervent intentions of his minde, then to remit them for the safeguard of his health: Much like the speech of that <HI>famously learned D^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">.

<ITEM>2. For his Gravity, he was of a very<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grauity.</NOTE> comely presence, he had a countenance so finely tempered with gravitie and austerity, that hee in a manner commanded respect from others; insomuch that many forbare to speake or act unseemely things in his pre|sence,
<PB REF="21">
that would not have beene so modest in other company: Such a Majestie doth grace imprint upon the countenances of ho|ly men, that they draw respect from the greatest: this made those persecuting Em|perours to feare the verie faces of those poore Christians that appeared before them: And this caused <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great so to honour the countenance of Old <HI>Paph|nutius</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">crates <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> 1. c. 8.</NOTE> though disfigur'd by the losse of his eye, that he did often for his delight kisse the hollow of that eye which was lost for the cause of CHRIST. So true is that of <HI>Salo|mon,</HI> wisedome causeth the face to shine, and the rigour of the countenance to bee chan|ged.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. He was very Zealous for GOD, not<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zeale.</NOTE> onely by the power of his Ministery in con|verting many, wherein GOD had wonderful|ly blessed him, but in any publike or private good that tended to the honour of GOD, to whose glory he wholly sacrificed himselfe and all his studies, which I can the more safely affirme, in that I know he hath divers times<NOTE PLACE="marg">A true argument that he sought not great things to himselfe.</NOTE> refused preferment from some of the Nobi|lity
<PB REF="21">
and Prelates of this Kingdome, and for no other cause in the world, but that hee might not be divorced from that countrey where his Ministery was so much embraced and wrought so good effects.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. But zeale is oft of such violent motion, that as the antient Philosophers supposed of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wisdome.</NOTE> the <HI>primum mobile,</HI> that if the motion thereof were not finely cooled and allayed by the <HI>coelum Christallinum</HI> next to it, it would set all the Orbes on fire; and therefore the zeale of this Reverend man was alwayes tempered with singular Wisedome and discretion, for though in all his Sermons he prest mightily upon the conscience of his hearers, who ma|ny times like babes childishly wrangled at the breasts which should nourish them, yet were they never able to resist the authority by which he spake, so that for the space of 22 yeares being the whole time that his Lamp of light shined in <HI>Northampton</HI> Shire, his doctrine was never drawne into question either for error or schisme: so studious was hee ever of the unity and peace of the Church of ENGLAND which hee dearely
<PB REF="22">
loved that none could justly quarrell with him, but Papists and other Sectaries, as also others that were corrupted with error or evill life.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Lastly for his Charity, hee was ever<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charity.</NOTE> universally bountifull, but especially he ex|ceeded in those publike distresses of <HI>Germa|ny, France, Bohemia, &amp;c.</HI> and to those that stood in true neede: for the enabling of him|selfe hereunto, I have heard him often say (&amp; he made it evident to me) that ever since he was Minister of <HI>Broughton,</HI> he spent every yeare all the revenewes of his Parsonage (which was of good valew) in the mainte|nance of his family and acts of hospitality and charity; And that the estate wherewith GOD hath blessed him otherwise, was meere|ly raised by that temporall estate hee had at first. Let them therefore of his owne coate from henceforth cease to traduce him, whom they never did nor dare to imitate. I am sure the Towne of <HI>Broughton</HI> will ever blesse GOD for his charity: for when that lamen|table fire was among them, <HI>September</HI> 21: <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1626. besides the many pounds
<PB REF="22">
he spent out of his owne purse, he was a chiefe meanes that by the only supply of the country without any Letters Patents from above, their houses which were burnt down unto the ground were all new built, and their outward estates liberally sustained and up|held. Nay such was his charity, that though some of his owne towne had not onely slan|dered his Ministry, but wronged him in his tithes, yet he put it up, and never called them to question as he might, nor ever had any suite with them. So that I may for con|clusion summe up this in that wittie com|mendation of <HI>Nazianzen</HI> on <HI>Basill</HI> the Great,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oratio funebr|in laudem <HI>Ba|silj.</HI></NOTE> <HI>He thundered in his Doctrine, and lightned in his conversation.</HI></ITEM>

<P>This inestimable treasure it pleased GOD<NOTE PLACE="marg">14.</NOTE> to put in an earthen vessell, and about the<NOTE PLACE="marg">His sickenesse.</NOTE> beginning of <HI>September</HI> last, began to breake it by visiting him with a <HI>Quartan ague;</HI> a dis|ease which brought <HI>Calvin</HI> to his end, and by the judgement of the best Physitians, by reason of the long &amp; grievous paroxysmes whereby it afflicts, is ever deemed mortall vnto old men: and so it appeared to him,
<PB REF="23">
for perceiving after two or three sits that it mastered his strength, he patiently submitted to indure, what by strugling hee could not overcome; And called for his <HI>Will</HI> which he had made long before, and perfecting some things in it, he caused it to be laid up, and afterwards wholly retired into himselfe, quitting the world and solacing his soule with the meditation of the joyes of heaven, which he had provided to preach to his peo|ple, for having compiled an elaborate dis|course, <HI>de quatuor Novissimis,</HI> of the foure last things, DEATH, IVDGEMENT, HELL <HI>and</HI> HEAVEN, an argument that some Ie|suites and Friars have bungled in, and ha|ving finished the three former, told them that the next day he would treat of Heaven: But the day before being Saturday he was visited with sickenesse, and never preached after. GOD then preparing him for the fruition of those inexplicable joyes which hee had provided for his people in contemplation.</P>
<P>His sickenesse though it was long and<NOTE PLACE="marg">15.</NOTE> sharpe, yet he bare it with admirable pati|ence, for he saw Him that <HI>was invisible,</HI> and his
<PB REF="23">
whole delight was to bee with Him, often breathing out such speeches as these whiles the violence and frequencie of his fits gave him any intermission, <HI>Oh when will this good hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 words"> shall I bee dissolved, when shall I bee with CHRIST?</HI> Being told that it was indeed better for him to be dis|solved, but the Church of GOD could not misse him nor the benefit of his Ministery. To which he thus sweetely replyed with <HI>David:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Sam. 15. 25, 26.</NOTE> <HI>If I shall finde favour in the eyes of the LORD hee will bring mee againe and shew me both it and his habitation, but if otherwise, loe heere I am, let him doe what seemeth good in his eyes.</HI> Being asked by another, whether hee could not bee content to live if GOD would grant him life, he thus answered; <HI>I grant that life is a great blessing of GOD, neither will I neglect any meanes that may preserve it, and doe heartily desire to submit to GODS will: But of the two I infinitely desire to be dissolved and to bee with CHRIST.</HI></P>
<P>In the time of his sickenesse there<NOTE PLACE="marg">16.</NOTE> came many to visit him, but hee admit|ted none but his intimate friends, using a

speech of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Ant&egrave; dies firme decem qu&agrave;m exitet &egrave; corpore &agrave; no|bis postulavit praesentibus, ne quis adeum ingredetetur, nisi ijs tantum horis quibus medici ad in|spiciendum in|trarent, velcum ei inferretur refectio, &amp; it&agrave; observatum ac factum est, &amp; omni illo tempore o|rationi vaca|bat. <HI>Possid. de vit.

He encouraged the Ministers that came to him, to be diligent and couragious in the worke of the LORD, and not to let their spirits faint or droope for any affliction that should arise thereupon. To all that came to him, he bad them make sure of CHRIST, before they came to die, and to looke upon the world as a lump of vanity; He thanked GOD for his wonderfull mercy to him in pulling him out of hell in sealing his Ministry with the con|version of many soules, which he wholly as|cribed to his glory.</P>
<P>About a weeke before he died, when his<NOTE PLACE="marg">17.</NOTE> silver cord began to loosen, and his golden boule to breake: He called for his wife, and
<PB REF="24">
desired her to beare his dissolution, which was now at hand, with a Christian fortitude, a thing which he had prepared her for by the space of twenty yeares, telling her that his approaching death was decreed upon him from all eternity, and that the counsell of the LORD must stand, and bad her make no<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isay 46.</NOTE> doubt but shee should meete him againe in Heaven: And turning toward his <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">He had five Children, one sonne, and foure daughters.</NOTE> children told them, that they should not expect hee should now say any thing to them, neither would his ability of body and breath give him leave, he had told them enough in the time of his sicknesse and before, and hoped they would remember it, and verily believed <HI>that none of them durst thinke to meete him at that great Tribunall in an unregenerate state.</HI> About two daies after, divers of his Parish com|ming to watch with him, he was mooved <HI>by a friend</HI> that as he had discover'd to them by his Doctrine, the exceeding comforts that were in CHRIST, he would now tell them what he felt in his soule. <HI>Alas</HI> (said he) <HI>doe they looke for that of me now that want breath and power to speake?

<P>The night before hee died, when the doores without began to be shut, and the daughters of Musicke to bee brought low, and hee lying very low with his head, expe|cting every moment when the wheele should be broken at the Cisterne, yet being told that some of his deare friends were then about him to take their last farewell, He cau|sed himselfe to be lifted up, and then like old <HI>Iacob bowing himselfe on his beds-head,</HI> after a few gaspings for breath, hee spake in this manner. <HI>I am now drawing on apace to my dis|solution, and am just in the Case of</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>A Iustice of Peace in</HI> North|hampton <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">re, whose vertuous memorie I can never th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">nke of but in the phrase of the Apostle,</HI> The world was not wor|thy of him, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.</NOTE> <HI>Sir</HI> Iohn Pickering, <Q><HI>Hold out Faith and patience, your work will speedily be at an end:</HI> And then <HI>sha|king them all by the hands, prayed heartily, and particularly</HI> for them, and desired them <HI>to make sure of heaven, and to</HI> beare in minde

<P>_WE have here in this Chapter, First, A <HI>Consolation</HI> for GODS people in the time of their Captivity. The Summe whereof is this: Though all things seeme to threaten ru|ine, and tend towards confu|sion; yet the issue wilbe, that GOD will most mer|cifully rescue and relieve His owne; who after|wards, will not onely themselves acknowledge
<PB N="2" REF="30">
and magnifie His miraculous hand in their preser|vation and support, but also stirre up others to re|ly wholly upon that mighty LORD, that never did, or ever will faile or forsake any that put their trust in Him. In the seven first Verses.</P>
<P>Secondly, An <HI>Institution</HI> or <HI>Instruction,</HI> How the godly should carie themselves in the time of cros|ses and chastisements; and what difference there is betweene them and the gracelesse in such Cases. From Ver. 7&punc; to the end.</P>
<P>In the first Part we may take notice, and into our consideration these three Points.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Provision of a comfortable <HI>Song</HI> for the people to carie with them, as it were into Captivi|ty, and the fiery Triall; that in the midst of their pressures they might be eased and refresht with a conceit, that the Day would come, wherein they should joyfully sing the song of enlargement, and salvation, Ver. 1. Though when they <HI>sate downe by the rivers of Babylon,</HI> their hearts would not serve them to sing any <HI>Song of Zion,</HI> but fell asun|der in their brests like drops of water, yet assured|ly, all GODS faithfull Ones, who believed His Prophet and Promises, would in the meane time secretly sweeten their sorrowes and sufferings, with a patient expectation of this happy Day, and heavenly mirth.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Song it selfe, Ver. 1, 2, 3. Wherein we may consider, 1. The Time, when the Song shall be sung: <HI>In that Day</HI>] which we may vnderstand, 1. Historically, literally, typically, of the Israe|lites deliverance out of Babylon, and the miserable
<PB N="3" REF="30">
slavery thereof. 2. Anti-typically, of the bles|sed enlargement of GODS Elect out of the snares and bondage of the Devill. 3. And mystically also, as some Divines thinke, of the joyfull com|ing of Christians out of spirituall Babylon, <HI>Rev.</HI> 17. 5. and from under the tyrannie of Antichrist. 4. Complementally, of gathering the Saints out of this vale of teares, and from the eager pursuit of that great red Dragon, and the powers of dark|nesse, into <HI>Ierusalem</HI> which is above, where they shall joyfully sing triumphant Halelujahs in the highest heaven for ever and ever, <HI>Galat.</HI> 4. 26. 2. The Matter of the Song; which is, <HI>Salvation,</HI> Ver. 1. <HI>Peace;</HI> Ver. 3. <HI>Holy company,</HI> Ver. 2. Pure pleasure, comfort, sound contentment, &amp;c.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. An Exhortation, or exhortatory apostro|phe, to trust in <HI>Iehovah.</HI> And there is added, for <HI>ever;</HI> lest upon Gods delay, and respiting reliefe, we should despaire, or have recourse unto the <HI>arme of flesh.</HI> Reasons to enforce this exhortation are three. 1. In Him is <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>rupes saeculorum,</HI> ever|lasting strength, Ver. 3. A <HI>rocke of eternity,</HI> upon which we may for ever sweetly and safely rest and repose our selves, amidst the many furious storms and boisterous waves of this troublesome world. 2. He is able to tame, take downe, and trample in the mire, the insolency and pride of the most ra|ging persecutors, Ver. 5. And to raise His, though never so low and languishing, to set them upon a Rocke of safety and salvation for ever, and to give them the neckes of their enemies to tread upon, Verse 6. 3. Hee <HI>weighes</HI> and watches over
<PB N="4" REF="31">
the waies of the <HI>just,</HI> Verse 7. See <HI>Ieremie</HI> 17. 7.</ITEM>

<P>Now whereas the Prophet in the first place doth furnish the people of GOD before hand with a strong counter&punc;comfort and cordiall against their faintings in the furnace of affliction, we may thence be instructed; that,</P>
<Q><HI>DOCT.</HI> It is an holy wisdome, and happy thing to treasure up comfortable provision against the Day of calamity.</Q>
<Q>It is good counsell, and a blessed course, to store up comfort against the evill Day.</Q>
<P><HI>He that gathereth in Summer,</HI> (saith <HI>Salomon) is a sonne of understanding: But he that sleepeth in Har|vest, is a sonne of confusion, Prov.</HI> 10. 5. If not by an immediate sense, yet by a warrantable analogy and good consequent this Place will beare this Para|phrase.</P>
<P>That man which now in this faire and seasonable Sun-shine of his gracious visitation is lull'd asleepe with the Syren-songs of these sensuall times upon the lap of pleasure; swims downe the tempori|zing torrent of these last and lewdest daies with full saile of prosperity and ease, against the secret wasts and counter-blasts (as it were) of a reclaim|ing conscience, as thousands do, to their utter un|doing for ever; mis-spends his golden time, and many goodly opportunities of gathering spirituall <HI>Manna,</HI> in grasping gold, gathering wealth, grow|ing great, greatning his posterity, clasping about the arme of flesh, satisfying the appetite, and ser|ving himselfe: In a word, he that while it is called <HI>To day,</HI> turnes not on Gods side, and by forward|nesse
<PB N="5" REF="31">
and fruitfulnesse in His blessed waies, trea|sures up comfort and grace against his ending houre, shall most certainly upon his bed of death, and illumination of conscience, find nothing but horrible confusion and feare, extremest horrour, and insupportable heauinesse of heart: his soule must presently downe into the kingdome of dark|nesse, and bottome of the burning lake, there to lie everlastingly in tempestuous and fiery tor|ments, the sting and strength whereof doth not onely surpasse the pens and tongues of Men and Angels, but the very conceipt of those that suffer them, which if a man knew, he would not endure one houre for all the pleasures of ten thousand worlds: His body (the pleasing and pampering whereof hath plunged him into such a sea of cala|mity and woe) must descend into the house of death, an habitation of blacknesse and cruelty: lie downe in a bed of <HI>dust</HI> and rottennesse <HI>covered with wormes,</HI> guarded and kept full sure by the Prince and powers of darknesse <HI>unto the judgement of the great Day:</HI> and then the whole man must become the woful object, of the extremity and everlasting|nesse of that fiercest and unquenchable wrath, which, like infinite rivers of brimstone, will feed upon his soule and flesh, without remedie, ease, or end.</P>

the span of his transitory life after the waies of his owne heart: and how truly he is a sonne of under|standing, who in the few and evill daies of short abode upon earth, treasures up grace and spiri|tuall riches against the dreadfull winter night of death.</P>

They are rais'd on hie, saith the very Poet, that their ru|ine may be more irrecoverable.

If ever great men, or earthly Potentates did take their slattering slaves out of the hands of GOD, at that highest Tribunall, or were able to free a guilty soule from eternall flames; it were something to grow rich, and rise by vile accommodations, and serving their turne in the meane time.

<P>By <HI>comfortable Provision</HI> therefore, I meane trea|sures of a more high, lasting, and noble nature: The blessings of a better life, comforts of godli|nesse, graces of salvation, favour and acceptation with the highest Majesty, &amp;c. They are the rich|es of heaven onely which we should so hoard up, and will ever hold out in the times of trouble, and Day of the Lords wrath. Amongst which, a sound faith, and a cleare conscience are the most peerlesse and unvaluable jewels; able by their na|tive puissance, and infused vigour, to pull the very heart (as it were) out of Hell, and with confidence and conquest to looke even Death and the Devill in the face. There is no darknesse so desolate, no crosse so cutting, but the splendor of these is able to illighten, their sweetnesse to mollifie.</P>
<P>So that the blessed counsell of CHRIST, <HI>Mat.</HI> 6. 19, 20. doth concurre with, and confirme this Point: <HI>Lay not up for your selves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt; and where theeves breake thorow and steale.

Where did that man dwell, or of what cloth was his coat made, that was ever comforted by his goods, greatnesse, or great men, in that last and sorest conflict? In his wrastlings with the accusations of conscience, terrours of death, and oppositions of hell? No, no: It is matter of a more heavenly metall, treasures of an higher temper, riches of a nobler nature, that must hold out, and helpe in the distresses of soule, in the anguish of conscience, in the houre of death, against the stings of sinne, wrath of GOD, and last Tribunall. Do you think that ever any glorified soule did gaze with delight upon the wedge of gold, that tramples under foot the Sun, and lookes All-mighty GOD in the face? No, no: It is the society of holy Angels, and blessed Saints, the sweet Communion with its dea|rest Spouse, that unapproachable light which crownes GODS sacred Throne, the beauty and brightnesse of that most glorious Place, the shi|ning Body of the SONNE of GOD, the beatificall fruition of the Deity it selfe, the depth of Eterni|ty, and the like everlasting Fountaines of spirituall

ravishment and joy, which onely can feed and fill the restlesse and infinite appetite of that immortall Thing with fulnesse of contentment, and fresh pleasures, world without end.</P>
<P>Thrice blessed and sweet then is the advice of our Lord and Master IESVS CHRIST, who would have us to turne the eye of our delight, and eagernesse of affection from the fading glosse, and painted glory of earthly treasures; wherein natu|rally the worme of corruption and vanity ever breeds, and many times the worme of an evill con|science attends; the one of which eats out their heart when we expect an harvest; The other seizes upon the Soule in the time of sorrow, and sinks it into the lowest hell: And as Men of GOD, and Sonnes of Wisdome, to mount our thoughts, and raise our spirits, and bend our affections to <HI>things above;</HI> which are as farre from diminution and decay, as the Soule from death; and can be no more corrupted or shaken, than the Seat and Omnipotency of GOD surprised. For, besides that, they infinitely surpasse in eminency of worth and sweetnesse of pleasure, the comprehension of the largest heart, and expression of any Angels tongue; they also out-last the dayes of heaven, and run parallell with the life of GOD, and line of Eternity. As we see the Fountaine of all materiall light to powre out his beames, and shining abun|dantly every day upon the world without weari|nesse, emptinesse, or end; so, and incomparably more doth joy and peace, glory and blisse, spring and plentifully flow every moment with fresh
<PB N="14" REF="36">
streames from the face of the <HI>Father of Lights</HI> upon all His holy ones in heaven, and that everlastingly. O blessed then shall we be upon our beds of death, if (following the counsell of our dearest LORD, who shed the most precious and warmest bloud in His heart to bring our soules out of hell) we treasure ap now in the meane time, heavenly hoards which will ever happily hold out, a stocke of grace, which never shrinks in the wetting, but a|bides the triall of the spirit, and touch-stone of the Word in all times of danger, and Day of the LORD: even that accurate, circumspect, and pre|cise walking, pressed upon us by the Apostle, <HI>Eph.</HI> 5. 15.

So much op|posed and bitterly opprest by the world; and yet, without which none of us shall ever see the face of GOD with comfort. If while it is called <HI>To Day,</HI> we make our peace with His heavenly Highnesse, by an humble continued exercise of repentance; by standing valiantly on His side; by holding an holy acquaintance at His mercifull Throne with a mighty importunity of prayer, and godly conver|sation above; by ever offering up unto Him in the armes of our Faith (when he is angry) the bleed|ing Body of His owne crucified SONNE, never giving Him over, or any rest, untill He bepleased to register and enroll the remission of our sinnes in the Booke of Life, with the bloudy lines of CHRISTS Soule-saving sufferings, and golden

characters of His owne eternall love. If now, before we appeare at the dreadfull Tribunall of the euer-living GOD, (and little know we whose turne is next) we make our friends in the Court of Heaven: the <HI>blessed Angels,</HI> in procuring their joy and love, by a visible constancy in the fruits, teares, and truth of a sound conversion. The <HI>Spi|rit of comfort</HI> by a ready and reverent entertain|ment of His holy <HI>Motions</HI> and inspirations of grace: the <HI>Sonne and Heire</HI> of the King of glory, the Foundation and Fountaine of all our Blisse, in this world and the world to come: from whose meritorious bloud shed and blessed mediation a|rise all those flouds of mercy and favour, which refresh our Soules in this vale of teares; and also those unknown bottomlesse seas of pleasure, peace and all unspeakable delights, which will super|abound, and overflow with new and fresh sweet|nesse for ever and ever in the Paradise of GOD. Blessed are they, that ever they were borne, who have already got Him their Advocate at the right hand of His Father. For, besides many other glorious priviledges thereby, in all their exigents and extremities, they may be ever welcome to the <HI>Seat of mercy,</HI> and be sure to speed. If a man had a suit unto the King, it were a comfortable and hap|py thing to find a friend in Court. But if the Kings speciall and choisest Favourite; nay, His own only Son were his Intercessour; how confi|dent would he be to prevaile and prosper, to con|quer his opposites, and crowne his desires? Why then should any poore Christian be discomforted
<PB N="16" REF="37">
and cast downe: nay, why should he not be ex|traordinarily raised and ravished in spirit with much joyfull hope, and sweet assurance, when he throwes himselfe downe at the Throne of grace; sith the dearest Sonne of the eternall GOD, the Heire of heaven and earth, the Mediator of the great Covenant of endlesse salvation is his Advo|cate at the hand of His All-mighty Father in the most high and glorious Court of Heaven? Wherefore when an humbled soule, and trem|bling spirit is sore troubled, and almost turned backe from his purpose of prayer, and prostration at the foot of heavenly Majesty, by entertain|ing before hand a feeling apprehension of his owne abhorred vilenesse, and the holy purity of GODS all-seeing and searching eye, <HI>which cannot looke on iniquity;</HI> let this consideration comfort and breed confidence, that IESVS CHRIST the <HI>Son of</HI> GODS <HI>love</HI> doth sollicite and tender the suit, who out of His owne sense and sympathy of such like troubles and temptations, doth deale for us with a true, a naturall, and a sensible touch of compassionatenesse and mercy.

<ITEM>1. Taking this counsell betime, and hoarding up heavenly things in this harvest time of grace, mightily helps to asswage the smart, mollifie the bitternesse, and illighten the darknesse of the evill Day. It is soveraigne, and serves to take the ve|nime, sting and teeth, out of any crosse, calamity, or distresse: and so preserves the heart from that raging hopelesse sorrow, which, like a devouring <HI>Harpie,</HI> dries up, dissolves, and destroyes the bloud, spirits, and life of all those who are destitute of such a divine Antidote. What vast difference may we discerne betweene <HI>Iob</HI> and <HI>Iudas; David</HI> and <HI>Achitophel, in the daies of evill?</HI> The two men of God being formerly enriched with his favour and familiarity, so behaved themselves, the one in the ship-wracke of his worldly happinesse, the o|ther in the hazard of his Kingdome, as though they had not beene troubled at all: <HI>The</HI> LORD<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob 1.</NOTE> <HI>gave; and the</HI> LORD <HI>hath taken away,</HI> saith <HI>Iob,</HI> when all was gone, <HI>blessed be the name of the</HI> LORD. <HI>If I shall find favour in the eyes of the</HI> LORD, saith<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 15. 25. 26. 21</NOTE> <HI>David, He will bring me againe, and shew me both it, and His habitation. But if He thus say, I have no de|light in thee: behold, here am I, let Him do to me, as seemeth good unto Him.</HI> But the spirits of the other two false and rotten-hearted fellowes in the time of trouble were so overtaken, nay, over whelm|ed with griefe, that they both hanged them|selves.</ITEM>

happily prevent a great deale of restlesse impatien|cy, reprobate feares, forlorne distractions of spirit, hying to the caves, crying to the mountaines, bootlesse relying upon the arme of flesh; <HI>Cursing their King and their</HI> GOD, <HI>and looking upward,</HI> roar|ing out with hideous groanes; <HI>Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? Who among us shall dwell with the everlasting burnings?</HI> &amp;c. All which desperate terrours and tumultuations of consci|ence are wont to surprize and seize upon unholy and unprepared hearts, especially when GODS hand is finally and implacably upon them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. And we shall hereby excellently honour and advance the glory of Profession; when it shall appeare to the world, and even the contrary|minded are enforced to confesse; that there is a secret heavenly vigour, undauntednesse of spirit, and noblenesse of courage which mightily up|holds the hearts of holy men in those times of confusion and feare, when theirs melt away with|in them like water, and <HI>be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.</HI> Worldlings wonder, and gnash the teeth hereat: When they see, as <HI>Chrysostome</HI> truly tels us, the Christian to differ from them in this; that he beares all crosses couragiously; and with the wings (as it were) of faith, out soares the height of all humane miseries. He is like a Rocke, incorporated into IESVS CHRIST, the <HI>Rocke of eternity,</HI> still erect inexpugnable, unshaken, though most furiously assaulted with the tempe|stuous waves of any worldly woe, or concurrent rage of all infernall powers. But all the imaginary

man-hood of gracelesse men doth ever in the day of distresse either vanish into nothing, or dissolve into despaire.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Expression of spirituall strength in the time of trouble from former heavenly store, is a nota|ble meanes to move others to enter into the same good way, and grow greedy after grace; to draw and allure them, to the entertainment and exercise of those ordinances, and that <HI>One necessary thing,</HI> which onely can make them bold and unmoovea|ble like <HI>Mount Zion</HI> in the day of adversity. I have knowne some, the first occasion of whose conver|sion, was, the observation of their stoutnesse and patience under oppressions and wrongs, whom they have purposely persecuted with extremest malice and hate. So blessed many times is the brave, resolute, and undaunted behaviour of GODS people in the time of triall, and amidst their forest sufferings, that it breeds in the hearts of beholders, thoughts even of admiration and love, nay a desire of imitation, and turning on the other side. When they represent to the eye of the world their ability to passe thorow the raging flames of fiery tongues untouched, to possesse their soules in peace, amidst scorpions, thornes, and rebels, to passe by basest indignities from basest men without wound or passion, to hold up their heads above water in the most boisterous tempests, and deepest seas of danger, to triumph over all adversary power in the evill day; I say, by GODS blessing, this may make many come in and glorifie GOD, marvelling and enquiring,
<PB N="20" REF="39">
whence such invincible fortitude, and bravenesse of spirit should spring; concluding with <HI>Nabu|chadnezzar:</HI> Surely, <HI>The servants of the most high</HI> GOD.

Nay, some are such cruell caitifs and <HI>Cannibals</HI> to their owne soules, and so accursedly blinded by the Prince of darknesse, that instead of comfortable provision, they heape up wrath against the day of wrath; instead of grace, GODS favour, and a good conscience, peace, joy, and refreshing <HI>from the presence of the</HI> LORD, they lay up scourges, and Scorpions for their na|ked soules and guilty consciences against the time and terrour of the LORDS visitation. For, let them be most assured; all their lies, oathes, rotten and railing speeches; all their covetous, lustfull, ambitious and malicious thoughts; all their swaggering and furious combinations against GODS people, sensuall revellings, joviall meet|ings, &amp;c. will all, <HI>When their feare commeth as deso|lation, and their destruction commeth as a whirle|wind,</HI> like so many envenimed stings, run into their sinfull soules, and pierce them thorow with ever|lasting sorrow.

<P>Which we must onely understand of returning a|ny more to life and light in this world. Nay, in a word, lay thy selfe loaden with the utmost of all earthly excellencies and felicities in the one scale of the ballance, and vanity in the other, and vanity will weigh thee downe. Take heed therefore of trusting to the world in the meane time, lest it torture thee extremely in the time of trouble.</P>
<P>3. Take heed of weakening in the meane time, and unnecessarily over-wearying thy spirit:</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="51">1. By carking fore-thought of future evils, which forty to one may never fall out. Many men I am perswaded, (such is the naturall vanity of our minds) do more vexe themselves with feare and fore-conceipt of imaginary evils, which never be|fall; then they have just cause, to take on and trouble their hearts for all other true, reall, actuall troubles, which fall upon them. Thus many times do men torture themselves vainly with im|moderate feare of forreine invasion, home-bred confusion, change of religion, the fiery triall, burning at a stake, distraction of mind, surprize by the Plague, Small Poxe, Purples, Spotted Fever, distresse and going backward in their outward state, losse of some child they love best, destructi|on of their goods by fire, robbery, ship-wracke, the frownes of greatnesse, hurt and revenge from those that hate them, hardnesse of heart, failing of their faith, spirituall desertion, overthrow by temptation, despaire of GODS mercies, sudden death, discomfortable cariage in their last sick|nesse, the <HI>king of feare</HI> himselfe; what shall be|come of their children, when they are gone, &amp;c. By these and millions moe of such causelesse and carking fore&punc;imaginations, the very flower and vi|gour of mens spirits may be much emasculated, and wasted wofully. A godly care to prevent them by repentance and prayer; and a carefull preparation by mortifying meditations, and Christian magnanimity to beare them patiently, if we be put unto it, is commendable and comforta|ble: but in the meane time to unspirit and mace|rate
<PB N="46" REF="52">
our selves with much distrustfull misery and needlesse torture about them, to our hindrance, distraction and discomfort in any businesses of ei|ther of our callings, or any waies, unchearefull walking; by slavish pre-conceipts to double and multiply their stings, and to suffer them so often before they seize upon us, is both un-noble and un-necessary: most unworthy the morall resolu|tion of a meere naturall man, and the generous spirit of an honest Heathen; much more the in|vincible fortitude of any of CHRISTS favourites, and heires of heaven.</P>
<P>Or&punc;</P>
<P>2. Selfe-created crosses, that I may so call them. For so it often is, that many maried cou|ples, governours of families (to instance there) ha|ving the world at will (as they say) and wanting nothing that heart can wish from GODS hand for outward things: and yet (I know not how) by reason of passion, covetousnesse, pride, waiward|nesse, frowardnesse, or something, they mutually embitter their lives one unto another with much uncomfortablenesse, discontentment and jarring. I would advise all such (and there are many and many such abroad in the world) punctually and impartially to examine their consciences; whe|ther such secret sinnes as these, of which they take no notice, may not be the causes of it.</P>
<P>1. Matching, as being not mooved principally and predominantly with portion, parentage, perso|nage, beauty, lust, riches, lands, slattery, friend|ship, greatnesse of family, forced perswasions, Pa|rents
<PB N="47" REF="52">
covetous importunity, or some base and ir|rellgious by-respect and gracelesse ground. This the Apostle calleth <HI>marrying in the</HI> LORD: that is, for no by respect, but in the feare of GOD, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. 39. Without which all matches are miserable, though they should be made up with hoards of wealth and heapes of gold as high as hea|ven, crowned with honours transcendent to the starres. The basenesse, folly and iniquity of these times is not more visible and eminent in any thing, than in making, or rather marring of marriages. How often may we see by ordinary observation a little golden glue to joyne fast in the dearest bonds, pearles and clay? And silken fooles to ca|rie away sufficiencies above their worthlesse weight in richest jewels? The world is stark mad in this Point. But they are rightly served; noble miseries and golden fetters are fit enough for such couples. For from this bitter root of a covetous, carnall, ambitious, or any wayes unconscionable choice, springs a world of misery and mischiefe; overthrow and ruine of great houses, scandalous divorces, unlawfull separations, dishonour, distur|bance, jealousies, adulteries, bastardies, braw|lings, mutuall exprobration of each others infir|mities, deformity, portion, parentage, or some o|ther cutting and netling matter of discontent; sin|full disorders in families, ill education of children, &amp;c. And, without repentance, after a few and wretched dayes tediously worne out with much irksomnesse and hearts-breake, lying together e|verlastingly in the lake of fire, there banning each
<PB N="48" REF="53">
other with much desperate horrour, and many bit|ter despairefull gnashings of teeth, that ever they entered into that estate.</P>
<P>2. Predominancy of carnall love. Which may be justly punished with many fits of frowardnesse and falling out, from such small occasions and light grounds; that the Parties may well perceive, that the correcting hand of GOD is in it leading them thereby to the sight and notice, to remorse and reformation of the brutish sensuality and sin|fulnesse of their matrimoniall affection; which should ever be rectified by reason, and spiritua|liz'd with grace. Mariage is rather a fellowship of dearest amity, then disordered love. And love and amity are as different as the burning sicke heat of a fever from the naturall kindly heat of a healthfull body.</P>
<P>3. Immodest or immoderate abuse of the ma|riage. Which, though it lie without the walk of humane lawes, yet divine justice doth many times deservedly chastise it with variety of visitations upon themselves, families, outward state, good name: with miscariages, barrennesse, bad chil|dren, giving them over to unnecessary distempers and strangenesse in their cariage one unto another, and other such like discomforts and crosses. Which (though they may also befall GODS chil|dren for other ends, yet) let all guilty cou|ples in such cases conceive, that they fall upon them for such secret sensuall exorbitancies and excesse.</P>
<P>4. Want of a comfortable communion in
<PB N="49" REF="53">
prayer, godly conference, mutuall communica|tion of their spirituall estate, and how they stand to GOD-ward, daies of humiliation, helping one another towards heaven, and that joyfull fore|thought of most certaine meeting together in the ever lasting mansions of glory, joy and blisse above. Such divine fellowship would incredi|bly sweeten that dearest indissoluble knot, and make that state a very earthly Paradise to those few black Swannes, that love so sweetly and gra|ciously together.</P>
<P>5. Ignorance, or negligence in the right un|derstanding and practising both of the com|mon and severall duties pertinent and pro|per to that estate. In all other Arts, Professi|ons, and Trades of life, the Practitioners de|sire and endeavour to be ready in, and ruled by the precepts and directions thereof: but as concerning this great mysterie of managing the mariage-state with wisdome, conscience and comfort, the most are as ignorant in those Treatises which teach their Duties (of which there are many excellent ones extant) as they are basely insolent in clownish frowardnesse or impe|rious tyranny, to create a great deale of needlesse discontent and misery, both to themselves and their yoke-fellowes.</P>
<P>4. Helpe also we may have for the Point in hand, even from the wiser Heathen. Who out of the very light of nature and grounds of reason, did learne and labour to mollifie and asswage the stinging fore-thoughts of ills to come;

Spirituall joy is many times much enlarged in times of tribulation: But the heart of the wicked is sorrowfull in laughter, and troubled with melancholy amidst their greatest mirth. 7. Spirituall joy is ordinarily most free, full, and at the highest in solitarinesse, soliloquies, and the

most retired exercises of the soule: but carnall joy and want of company are for the most part in|compatible. And it is kept in that poore little dy|ing life it hath, by good-fellowship, and sensuall imployments. 8. Carnall joy ever ends in bit|ternesse, spirituall in blessednesse. As the rivers of fresh water run their course with an hasty current to fall into the salt Sea; so the Posting Sun of all worldly pleasures after a short gleame, and vaine glistering, sets in the Ocean of endlesse sorrow.</P>

They see no such necessity of running after sermons, so much reading, pray|er, poring upon precise bookes, recourse to Puri|tan-Ministers, Humiliation-daies, &amp;c. They can believe quietly, follow their businesse, and go to

Heaven without so much adoe. Nay, they are so farre from being troubled in any of these kinds, that if any amongst them be troubled in mind, and extraordinarily visited with spirituall distresse, the portion many times of GODS dearest children; they presently please and applaud themselves, that they are free; and conceive and peremptorily conclude that the afflicted is an hypocrite, hath beene a more hainous sinner then others, or med|led too much with Scripture-businesses and di|vine matters.

He is driven many and many a time to the Throne of Grace with prayers, teares, and strongest wrastlings for auxiliary forces, and renewed strength.

Fourthly, aske them, How they prize the object they apprehend imaginarily; for it is no better: and it is but thus: If you were able to as|sure them of wallowing in all worldly pleasures with constant health, and immortality upon earth: they would with all their hearts, part with all their hope of heaven hereafter: For they are yet but carnall, though selfe-confident. But now the di|vinenesse and excellency of spirituall delights which justifying Faith doth extract from the Ob|jects about which it is exercis'd, doth so affect and

ravish the heart of the true Believer; that well ad|vised, in cold bloud, and out of temptation, he holds all the corporall felicities of ten thousand worlds, even world without end, in comparison of them, but as drosse, and dung, and dust in the bal|lance. Our part in the person of CHRIST, with the purchases of His dearest bloud, and possession of the Deity blessed for ever by His meanes, do more than infinitely transcend the utmost of all earthly contentments, rais'd above the highest possibility, by the most inventive and strongest i|magination, and to be enjoyed thorow a thousand eternities.</P>

But presse them further, over and besides all this, to the heart and life of religi|on, to the power and pith of godlinesse, crucify|ing of their corruptions, strangling their lusts, ma|stering their passions, parting with all sinne, unfa|shioning them to the times, abandoning for ever their darling pleasure, deniall of themselves, con|tempt of the world, daily walking with GOD, de|light in the <HI>way of holinesse,</HI> an holy keeping of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 35. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">.</NOTE> LORDS day, fruitfulnesse in all good workes, li|ving by faith, an uncowardly opposition to the iniquities of the present, &amp;c. which (they well know) wilbe necessarily accompanied with <HI>Drun|kards songs,</HI> railings of the basest, discountenance from ungodly greatnesse, the worlds deadliest en|mity, <HI>speaking against every where,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>I do not here curiously enquire with the Schoole-men; whether the glory of the body doth spring originally out of the blessednesse and beautifull excellency of the soule, and so redounds upon the body, by a continued constant influence, as <HI>Aquinas</HI> thinks. Or, (which I rather follow) that those excellent endowments and heavenly splendours are originally and dispositively im|planted by GODS hand in the reformed body, onely perfected and actuated (as it were) by the glorious soule, as <HI>Bonaventure</HI> supposeth. Sure I am in generall, they shalbe made <HI>like the glorious Body of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>Philip.</HI> 3. 21. And that is happi|nesse and honour enough, inexplicable, supere|minent.</P>

<HEAD>Upon my Patron.</HEAD>
<P>And here by your good leaves, I will be bold to make benefit of the instant occasion, because it is very seasonably coincident with the Point. And presse from that the practice of this last mortifying motive. These artificiall Formes of sadnesse, and complementall representations of sorrow in blacks and mourning weeds, are nothing for my purpose: neither do I desire to stirre up or renew in any man thoughts of heavinesse, or griefe of heart, which he might conceive and nourish by reason of some particular interest in the bounty, love, person, and worthy parts of the departed: many times men are too forward and overflowing in those tender offices, and last demonstrations of natural affection. And therfore my counsel in such cases is; that we would shew our selves Christi|ans: and by the sacred rules of Religion ever pre|vent that unseasonablenesse and excesse, which ma|ny times with a fruitlesse torture doth tyrannise over the hopelesse hearts of meere naturall men.</P>
<P>The Point that I would principally presse, and perswade unto, is a Christian, and compassionate taking to heart, the publike losse, that every one of us may upon that occasion be truly humbled in himselfe, and bettered in his owne soule. And I tell you true, especially in these times, this losse is great.</P>
<P>He was a revexend and learned Iudge, a Prince,
<PB N="153" REF="106">
and a great Man in Israel: nay a God upon earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All I say, is cuber from my owne certaine knowledge; or concurrent testi|mony above ex|ception. I would not speake a word, which I think not in my conscience to be true, to be heire of his possessions. It may be affecti|on may make me deliver things something passio|nately, and more unto the life.</NOTE> for so are Iudges stiled by the Spirit of GOD, <HI>Psal.</HI> 82. 6. Though he be departed this life like a man, and fallen as one of the Princes.</P>
<P>But these are nothing; they are but bare titles, in respect of any true worth.</P>
<P>He was really remarkable, and renowned for very speciall judiciary endowments, and sufficien|cies; and those aided and attended with many worthy additions of morality, and subordinate a|bilities. As first,</P>
<P>1. Such calmnesse in his affections, and mode|ration of his passions (as I never saw) even in his ordinary cariage. He might have been a mirrour (me thinks) in this point even amongst the ex|actest Moralists. And they say, that appeared most eminently in his publike passages and execu|tions of justice. And how needfull a vertue this is to a Iudiciall Place, those may best conceive, who either feele, or but consider what a cruell and in|tolerable thing it is for an ingenuous man to stand before a Iudge, who is prejudicately and passio|nately transported with anger, malice, or hatred against the party to be sentenced.</P>
<P>2. Patience to heare the basest, both parties, all they could say. And unwillingnesse to lend his eare to the one, without the others presence.</P>
<P>3. A great and happy memory.</P>
<P>4. Singular sagacity in searching and diving in|to the secretest and utmost circumstances (so farre as was possible) of the causes that came before him, that he might give the more righteous judge|ment.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="107">5. A marvellous tendernesse, and pitifull ex|acttnesse in his inquisitions after bloud. Holding, on the one side, the life of a man very precious: and yet, on the other side, perswaded of the truth and terrour of that place, <HI>Numb.</HI> 35. 33. <HI>For bloud, that defileth the land, and the land cannot be cleansed of the bloud that is shed therein, but by the bloud of him that shed it.</HI> But yet all these, whatsoever you ap|prehend, in my conceipt had not beene much worth, though good in their owne nature; nei|ther (to tell you true) should I have so much as nam'd them, had they not been aided, (as it were) and managed with three other most noble and ne|cessary vertues, especially in these times, which actuated them (as it were) and gave them their life and lustre.</P>
<P>1. A love to integrity, the right and truth in all his judiciall courses, which (for any thing I know, or could ever heare) no man living upon just ground can or will contradict.</P>
<P>2. With a constant and resolute heart-rising a|gainst bribery and corruption; the cursed bane of all goodnesse, honesty, and good conscience, wheresoe'er it comes. And to this, that high place he worthily held about the Prince, can give royall attestation: where he qualified fees to his owne losse; and protested his resolution, and all possible opposition to all offers for offices, with this reason: he would have them come in cleare|handed, that they might deale honestly in their places. And his owne followers, to whom he gave a charge at his first entrance to a judiciall
<PB N="155" REF="107">
place, that they should not meddle, nor make any motions to him, that he might be secur'd from all appearance of corruption. And, as I am credibly inform'd, his ordinary reading of great letters, and rejection of gratuities after judgement given.</P>
<P>3. With a noble and unshaken resolution, and mighty opposition of Popery: and that without respect or feare of any greatnesse, as we have evi|dent demonstration. Now of this we need no further testimony (though there be very pregnant and plentifull besides) than the present triumph of the Papists; and barbarous insultations of that bloudy and murdrous generation. And especial|ly in yonder Country of Lancashire, and those Northerne Parts; where he shooke the pillars of Popery more valiantly and succesfully, than any these many yeares. Officers in those Parts ob|serv'd, that in his two or three yeares, he convi|cted, confin'd, and conform'd moe Papists than were in twenty yeares before. And that last charge he gave at <HI>Lancaster</HI> in his last Circuit but one, for I meddle not with the last of all, for law|learning, earnestnesse and excellency against Po|pery, prophanenesse, non-residency, and other corruptions of the times, and for the extraordina|ry heartning and encouraging all good men and godly Ministers was such, that I am perswaded, it wilbe remembred with dearenesse and love, while any honest man that heard it or heard of it, is alive in those Parts. To go no further then: and this I now say, I speake of him as he was growne in his latter time; and out of hope he would have
<PB N="156" REF="108">
continued: and I speake it also in compassion of mine owne countrey; which I know by too good experience how pitifully it lies bleeding under the insolency of Papists, and multitude of Priests: and then I say, the redemption of the life of such a Iudge, in such times as we live, for the good of such a country, if we go no further, if that had con|sisted with GODS pleasure, had beene worth a Kings ransome.</P>
<P>I lay these things thus together upon purpose to aggravate the losse, that a compassionate consi|deration of the greatnesse thereof in those respects I have told you, may be as powerfull in begetting a godly and profitable sorrow and taking it to heart in all truly religious and loyall hearts: as I know rejoycing in his fall will create in the in|solent spirits of the enemies to GOD and the King, (I meane the Papists) barbarous insultations and triumph. I am perswaded, if we get as much humiliation out of the sense of a true losse, as the Papists hardning and obduration by apprehen|sion of their imaginary gaine, we shall make a good use of his death. I am a little more earnest, because I perceive the Papists begin already to ca|lumniate and slander.</P>
<P>Here is yet another Point of profitable conside|ration from the present occasion. When any wor|thy man in a State, especially who takes a faithfull discharge of his place, and the publike good to heart, is cut off by the hand of GOD; it is in a Christian jealousie, and out of spirituall wisdome to be holden as a presage of some more fearefull
<PB N="157" REF="108">
generall judgement to succeed. I have my ground, <HI>Isa.</HI> 3. 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. And therefore my counsell is, and in the present case for one: when any good Patriote which in some high place like a strong Pillar opposes the corruptions and Popery of the times: or any faithfull Pastor, which by his pray|ers (like a <HI>Moses</HI>) stands in the gap against the in|dignation of GOD, is taken away; that we take it to heart, as a <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">mento,</HI> to make our selves rea|dy against an evill day. And to tell you my mind, I am much afraid some heavy thing is preparing for us, our sinnes are growne unto such a height. I am no Prophet, nor the sonne of a Prophet; yet out of a comparative contemplation of GODS proceeding with His owne people in all former ages, I cannot but concurre with the judgement of a great Doctor delivered in an high place: The<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>White,</HI> pag. 80. at Spittle.</NOTE> sinnes of this Land are come to that elevation, that there is scarce left any roome for the mercy of GOD to helpe us. They are even full ripe for His revenging Hand. To his foure reasons I add two more: his are taken, 1. From the greatnesse and crying of the sinnes, which are very horrible; Atheisme, whoredome, Sodomy, bloud-shed, op|pression, sayes he; I add pride, drunkennesse, u|sury, &amp;c. 2. From the generality of them. All sorts are wrapt in them. 3. From their impu|dency: with brazen browes, and whorish fore|heads they out-face the Sun. 4. From their im|patiency of admonition and reformation: they grow so upon us, that all the Pulpits in ENGLAND cannot beat them downe. Adda 5^t. from 2 <HI>Chron.</HI>
<PB N="158" REF="109">
36. 16. And a 6^t. from <HI>Isa.</HI> 3. 1, 2, 3. <HI>&amp; seq.</HI> I meane the dropping away of many worthy men; and few take it to heart, or consider that they are taken away from the evill to come. We have lost many a godly man within this few yeares. The Princes Court was not many yeares since dis|rob'd and bereft of one of the noblest men that e|ver trod upon English mould, besides other noble ornaments, his eminency of grace made him so. For, Christian Nobility is best and truest, where GOD Himselfe is top of the kin, and Religion the root; in regard whereof all the rest (I meane that of riches, birth, learning or morality) are but sha|dowes and shapes of noblenesse. And the other yeare, a very worthy Doctor, and triumphant Champion against the Giants of <HI>Rome.</HI> Against whom they have since sent out an illiterate libell, cal'd, White dy'd Black; fit for the foule and black mouthes of such railing <HI>Rabshekaes.</HI> And now of late, to say no more, of a Chancellour of rare and remarkable integrity in his Place. I have not yet done, and yet the time is done: onely a word or two therefore, and so I'le make an end.</P>
<P>And yet let no man thinke, that I am come hi|ther;</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Either to smooth and mollifie any faults or frailties; any falls or infirmities; any personall sinnes or imperfections that might be in this great Man. I dare not go about to cover them; that's not my office; I leave that to the precious bloud of the Son of GOD, and tender-hearted mercies of our gracious Father. I would rather in this point
<PB N="159" REF="109">
advise great men to walke warily. For, their greatnesse makes their sinnes greater, and their mightinesse will make them mightily tormented, except they stand constantly on GODS side. Height of Place ever adds two wings unto sinne: Example and Scandall; whereby it soares higher, and flies much further. If the Sun be ecclips'd and obscur'd; a thousand eyes gaze upon it: a lesser Starre may be darkned, and no man take notice.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Or to fasten upon him any false praises in a flattering funerall Panegyrick. I dare not dawbe for a world of gold. Himselfe abhor'd that. And not long before his last sicknesse complain'd much against slattery, as a grievous iniquity of the times.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Or to make a solemne and formall narration of all his noble commendable parts. When I un|dertooke this businesse first, I studied onely, and bethought my selfe, how I might speake most pro|fitably, and make the best use of the present occa|sion to my living Auditors. And had I not found pregnant matter for that purpose, I had not beene here this day. And therefore for conclusion, and as the last and best service I can now do unto him, to whom I owed as much as any man alive: I will labour from the occasion to work some heavenly good (if GOD so please) upon the hearts, pre|sented here this day as a selected and choice num|ber of his worthiest and dearest friends. And to this end give me leave to single out, and propose for imitation, some worthy and noble parts of
<PB N="160" REF="110">
his, and onely those which I conceive may be most seasonable and suitable to the exigency of my Auditory. And I must also crave the aid of your loves unto him, and those softned thoughts of mortality which are wont to attend these times; that I may conveigh and commend them to your liking, and practise with more successe and strong|er impression.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>And the first I shall commend unto you, is,</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. His singular integrity and honorable pur|pose in disposing those Ecclesiasticall Livings he had in his power. And in this Point I my selfe can say more than any, who tasted deepliest of his worthy dealing this way. When I never sought after, as it is famously knowne, nor thought up|on any such thing, he sent for me, and bestowed that which I presently enjoy most freely. Which, though every Patron ought proportionably to do, yet the horrible corruptions abroad in the world in such cases do (as it were) by a kind of Antiperistasis make a duty a transcendent vertue. And this was not all. Though incrochments up|on the Church be like the breaches of the sea; a thousand to one never returne: yet did he restore to a farthing all that which had a long time beene detain'd from the Church; and parted with it most freely; though he had as much wit and power as any other to have continued it so, if he had pleas'd. And I said Ecclesiasticall Livings, though I instance but in one; because I partly knew his purpose for the rest. For, he gave me himselfe this message to as worthy and reverend a
<PB N="161" REF="110">
man, as I know unprefer'd in this Land; that if he would come unto him, he would give him the first that fell; and for no other reason in the world, but because he heard he was a reverend and worthy man. Now lay these things to the pra|ctice of the times, wherein there is such sinfull and Simoniacall packing together, compacting, secret covenanting with the party or friends for present money, or after-gratifications: some part of the tithes, or his owne must be reserv'd to the Patron; or he must be the Farmer at his owne price; or pin a wife upon the sleeve of the parson, as they contemptuously speake, (a base also and unworthy respect) or the like such wretched combinations to helpe one another towards hell: my disac|quaintance must excuse my ignorance in the termes: and then tell me if this was not a noble part in him worthy the imitation of the best. I am perswaded in this Point, he might be a patterne not only to all here present whom it might concerne, (though I looke upon the faces of some who have dealt also very nobly this way) but to all the Pa|trons in ENGLAND. Be pleas'd then, you that lov'd him to tread in his steps herein; and the ra|ther because your unconscionablenesse in so high and important a point for the glory of GOD, and the good of the Church, may not only bring upon your owne heads, your houses and posterity, the curse of GOD in the meane time: but also a company of poore soules cast away by reason of your corruption, against you at that last and great day: who will then cry out upon you before the
<PB N="162" REF="111">
face of GOD, Angels, and men; that you were the men who for a little bloudy gaine put upon them an ignorant, idle, dissolute, non&punc; resident, or some way unfaithfull Minister; (For, it is too common, that those who enter corruptly, deale unconscionably in their places) whereby they must now perish everlastingly; whereas if you had been honest and uncorrupt, there had beene hope they might have liv'd in the endlesse joyes of heaven. And what a vexing cry in the eares of all sacrilegious Church-robbers will that be of a damned wretch in hell; when he shall complaine e|verlastingly, that his soule had been sav'd, if such a man had not been Symoniacall.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. His forbearing travell upon the Sabbath in his Circuit. Whereby he wan a great deale of ho|nour to his name over all this Kingdome; pre|vailed in the same with others of his owne reve|rend ranke; and by his example (as hath been ob|serv'd) wan much encouragement, increase and re|gard to religion in those Countries thorow which he past. I would I might so much prevaile with you, as that upon this occasion you would be con|tent to take nearer to heart a more holy and hea|venly spending of the LORDS Day. Not one|ly in forbearing sin, the workes of your calling, idlenesse, vaine sports; this is but onely flying e|vill, and privative good: but also to ply with con|science and reverence all GODS holy Ordinan|ces; prayer, reading, singing of Psalmes publike|ly and privately; the Word preached specially, conference, meditation, and the like: and to feed
<PB N="163" REF="111">
and satisfie your prepared and hungry soules with all that sweetnesse, comfort, and spirituall strength; which they are wont to conveigh into humble hearts upon GODS holy Day; this also is doing of good and positive piety. For, a thousand to one, a constant keeper of the Sabbath is sound|hearted towards GOD: and as great odds, a com|mon Sabbath breaker (howsoever he may de|ceive his owne heart) is in truth and triall a stran|ger to the power of grace, and life of godli|nesse.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. His patient yeelding, and submission to pri|vate admonition. A vertue, ordinarily as farre out with great men, as flattery is familiar. Yet in him so as I tell you. Something there was, to which his private affection was very much endear'd; and his reputation thereabout in the respect of the world was also entangled in some more publike engagement. And yet when I in zeale and love to his soule and salvation, prest upon him in private as a Minister of GOD, and in the humblest manner I could, tendering my reasons against his resoluti|on; after he had well thought upon't, it never went further, all was dasht for ever. Yet let me tell you, he had formerly given me encourage|ment hereunto; intreating me once in private, to deale plainly with him. And now I am griev'd at heart, I did not more in this kind. Now I would to GOD, you would imitate him in this also; especially you that are great ones. Alas! You'le give the Physitian leave to tell you the diseases of your body: the Lawyer to shew you any flaw
<PB N="164" REF="112">
that is in your state: your Horse-keeper to tell you the surfets of your horse: nay, your Hunts|man the surrances of your dogs: and shall onely the Minister of GOD not tell you your soules are bleeding to everlasting death? Now GOD forbid.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. His taking his high place to heart. I meane his extraordinary industry and indefatigablenesse in his judiciary imployments. His painefulnesse this way was wonderfull even after his last sick|nesse had seaz'd upon him. If I should report un|to you the particulars from eye-witnesses, you would marvell. And I rather name and commend this unto you, because the contrary is cause of great misery in a Common-wealth. Oh it is la|mentable, when men mount into high roomes on|ly in a bravery, and vanity, and desire to be ad|or'd above others; or follow the execution of their places, and administration of justice, onely as a Trade, with an unquenchable and unconscio|nable thirst of gaine; which justifies the common resemblance of the Courts of Iustice to the Bush; whereunto, while the sheepe flies for defence in weather, he is sure to lose part of his fleece: when cunning heads hunt after greatnesse and promoti|on, purposely to execute the lusts of their owne hearts, and attaine their owne ends. Oh! this is the curse and cut-throat of worthy States; the bane and breake-necke of all honest government. Formalities of justice without a reall care and con|science to search the truth, and deale uprightly, do but serve to smother innocency and right: and
<PB N="165" REF="112">
that which was necessarily ordain'd for the com|mon good, is through shamefull abuse made the cause of common misery. I would all the Magi|strates in the Country were my hearers in this Point; I would hence intreat them with all ear|nestnesse and contention of Spirit, as they love ei|ther GOD or their Country; that they would with all noblenesse of a free spirit, and clearenesse of a good conscience, take their Places of Iustice to heart; be active, conscionable, resolute; not onely formall and cyphers; hunters after praise and plausiblenesse; that they would abominate even all appearance of bribery and partiality to the pit of hell: that they would not be angry with us when we presse and perswade them to round courses against the Papists, and dejection of Ale|houses; upon which point His royall Majesty, and the worthy Iudges so much beat; and when all's said, are the sinkes and sources of all villany, &amp;c. otherwise, howsoever they may please them|selves with the common applause: it were better the Common-wealth had never knowne them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. His resolutenesse against rising by corrupti|on and bribery. Whereupon (as I have heard) when he was first presented to that place of ho|nour about the Prince, it pleased our gracious So|veraigne to stile him the Iudge which would give no money. A blessed thing it were, were this heart in all. Then should we not have vines, olive trees, and figge trees wither away in obscurity, and brambles brave it abroad in the world. We
<PB N="166" REF="113">
should not have servants by insinuation and bribe|ry clime on Horse-backe, when Princes like ser|vants walke upon the ground. And this worthy Part in Him, was a very convenient Companion, and necessary Consequent as that was of the for|mer. For I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e never beleeve, that a Man which purposes from his Heart to be faithfull in a publick Charge, will ever be very forward in an ambitious pursuit of it. The illumination of Nature taught the Heathens so, and therefore they condemne it by a law <HI>de ambitu.</HI> Hunting after one hie roome even morally is most unworthy a Man of honour and worth, and He cannot better expresse His in|sufficiency, and weakenesse of Spirit, who is trans|ported with an impotent and impatient Humour this way. But now if to this ambitious basenesse there be an addition of bribery, it makes the mat|ter a great deale more vile, and dishonourable. Of this hatefull Merchandizing, besides other infa|mies and iniquities, which mingle with it, it is commonly said, That He which liueth in grosse, selleth by retaile. And therefore if a Man would continue truly Noble, and Worthy, comfortable in His conscience, and faithfull in His Place, if He be advanc't, let him either rise fairely, or els thanke GOD, and be content with His present station.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. An easinesse of accesse, affablenesse of ca|riage: A faire, loving, kind deportment towards all. I never saw a Man of such worth and great|nesse looke more mildly upon a meane Man in my life. And yet with so grave a presence, that neither the authority of his Person, nor due attributions
<PB N="167" REF="113">
to His Place receiu'd any disparagement or dimi|nution. I omit not even this, because even in this also He might have beene a notable Precedent to take downe the haughty imperious carriage of ma|ny abroad in the world of farre more inferiour Worth and Ignoble birth. For amongst all the<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">asill</HI> 406. ad fincm&punc;</NOTE> degenerations of our gentility; (I speake not of all, wee have many truly so called and worthy Gentlemen) from that true noblenesse and anci|ent Worth which dwelt formerly in the Gentle brests of English Nobles, this is not the least: That they thinke to beare downe all before them with an artificiall affected impetuousnesse, as it were, of Countenance; a disdainfull neglect and contemp|tuousnesse in their Cariage, with a kind of outbra|ving &amp; brow-beating of their Brethren. As though brave Apparell and a big looke were demonstrati|ons of a Noble Spirit, whereas very often they on|ly guild over a worthlesse, weake and gracelesse In|side. As amongst Professors of Religion, Hee's the best Christian, which is most humble: so in the Schoole of Morality he hath been holden the tru|est Gentleman, which is most Courteous.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. His happinesse in having religious Follow|ers. Follow Him also in this. He tasted the fruit of it in his last extremities. For being cast by Gods Providence upon that Place in the Country where He had not such meanes, and Opportunities for those last comfortable Spirituall Assistances, which a dying Man would desire; They were both able, and did pray with Him to the Occasion, and present necessities, where with He seemed to be
<PB N="168" REF="114">
much affected, and spoke seasonably unto Him out of the Booke of GOD. Whereupon I must tell you; (Let as many prophane scornefull Spirits iy be or gnash the Teeth at it, as will) Those Fol|lowers of His whosoever they were, call them Pu|ritanes, or what you will; Howsoever they might misse in some complementall circumstances, by reason of those amazments and griefe which sate fresh upon their Hearts for the losse of their so Noble a Lord, yet they did Him in those last Agonies more true service and Honour then all the swaggering Good-fellow Serving men will doe their Masters unto the worlds end: Let them fol|low you, as long as you will.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. A right conceit and commendation of pro|fitable and conscionable Sermons. He hath beene often heard of late times reply thus or in this sence to contradictions: I cannot tell, saies He, what you call Puritanicall Sermons; they come neerest to my Conscience, and doe Mee the most good. This of all the rest, I had purpos'd to have prest most upon you. If you were but thus affected, to say the least; you would begin to looke towards Heaven. But I have already trespast too much upon your Patitience. And therefore I conclude this Point with that of <HI>Paul, Philip.</HI> 4. 8. <HI>Finally, Bre|thren, &amp;c.</HI></ITEM>

<P>_THE blessed Apostle Saint <HI>Paul</HI> perceiving, that his prea|ching, and plantation of the Gospell of CHRIST recei|ved strong and mighty oppo|sition in the City of <HI>Corinth,</HI> a famous Mart Towne, seated betweene two Seas, the <HI>Aegaan</HI> and <HI>I&ouml;nian,</HI> and so fit

for commerce with other Nations, full of wealth, knowledge, glory, and the rest of earthly excellen|cies, labours in this Chapter to abase, and disho|nour the pride, and vanity of all humane great|nesse, and to advance the neglected Mystery of his heavenly Doctrine, and the glorious power of downe-right preaching, which the great men a|mongst them esteemed foolishnesse, yet indeed such as by which the LORD of Heaven and Earth saveth those that beleeve. And he so farre acquaints them with the counsell of GOD in the point: that he gives them to understand that upon the matter, whereas <HI>the noble, the mighty, and wise after the flesh,</HI> with all the bravery and selfe-confi|dence vanish and perish: Meaner men of lower ranke, and more contemptible are converted. In the words I read unto you he appeales to their owne experience in the point, and bids them look about, and view well, the worke of the Ministery amongst them, survey, and search throughly that goodly flourishing body of the Church, which he had there created, and collected by his eighteene months presence, and paines: And they shall find, that not many <HI>wise after the flesh, nor mighty, nor no|ble,</HI> gave their names unto CHRIST, or be|came Professors of the Gospell. But the foolish, and weake things of the world carrie all away in matter of salvation, and entertainement of CHRIST. He renders two Reasons in the Ver|ses following: 1. That the wise men of the world may be confounded: 2. And that GOD himselfe blessed for ever may have all the glory.
<PB N="171" REF="115">
The words then being plaine: <HI>Not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called,</HI> I build directly, and naturally this point upon them: <HI>Few great men goe to Heaven:</HI> Or<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doctrine.</NOTE> thus, <HI>Great men are seldome good.</HI> I here under|stand greatnesse according to the world: In re|spect 1.

<P>Greatnesse in any of these kinds is rarely ac|companied with goodnesse, few such great men as these are called, converted or ever come to heaven.

<P>1. <HI>Matth. 11. 25, 26.

<P>Heere by the way from our Sauiours words wee may extract a soveraigne Antidote against those temptations, and discontented reasonings which are wont to arise in our hearts sometimes, when we see those great ones of the world, who looke so big, and carrie their heads so high, not onely to carrie all before them, to wallow, and tumble themselves with all bravery and ap|plause in the glory, wealth, and pleasure of the world, to swimme downe the current of the times with full saile, and prosperous winde, though ma|ny times against the secret murmure, and counter|blasts even of their own Consciences. In a word, in these worst times to have what they list, and do what they will: but also lay about them with the fist of wickednesse, and scourge of tongues, to trample if it were possible the lambes of CHRIST even into the dust, with the feete of malice and pride, by a plausible tyranny, and aide of the times iniquity to keepe them downe still, and still in disgrace: hunting them continually with cruelty and hate like a Partridge in the mountaines, as the Pharisees did CHRIST: I say when we see this, let us never be troubled and take offence: let us never be grieved or grow dis|content or out of heart.

Who when they came to him, and heard him preach, they were so strucke and astonished with the most piercing Majesty of his Ministry, that they had no power to lay hands or hold upon him at all. Upon their returne, these great men ga|thered together in counsell against him; like so many morning Wolves thirsting eagerly for his bloud, calls hastily, and impatiently unto them, before their officers could say any thing: <HI>Why have yee not brought him?</HI> They doe not examine them about his doctrine, or inquire whether he be guilty or no: but like unjust, and tyrannicall wretches they labour to lay hold upon him, though most innocent, to stop his mouth, and make him sure. <HI>But the Officers answered: Never man spake like this man.</HI> Whereupon the spirit of prophane malice being yet further enraged in them, they reply: <HI>Are yee also deceived?</HI> What?

<P>And thus it is in all ages of the Church: There is a Lecture I will suppose; To which many of the meaner sort especially, resort for spirituall foode, as to the Market for corporall. Some of which happily wrought upon by the saving in|fluence of that Ministery, begins to blesse GOD for the benefit, and magnifie his mercy for such meanes: but some By-standers, like pestilent op|posites interpose: yea but which of the great men of the Countrey come to it, when doe you see any of the Nobles, Knights, or Gentlemen there? No, alas! They are afraid of hearing of their sins, being made Melancholicke, and to be tor|mented before their time: and therfore they most wretchedly <HI>neglect so great salvation,</HI> forsake their owne mercies, and judge themselves unworthy of everlasting life&punc; Bowling-greenes, gaming-hou|ses, horse-races, hunting-matches: Their curs, and their Kites: their cock-pits, and their cove|tousnesse, or something doe too often eate up and devoure that blessed fat, and marrow of time, those golden, and goodly opportunities, which GOD in great mercy affords them in the Ministry, to make their peace with him before they goe into the pit, and bee seene no more.

<P>3. <HI>Nehem.</HI> 3. 5. <HI>But their Nobles put not their necks to the worke of the</HI> LORD. Others (as you may see in that place) were industriously busie in building up the wals, and repairing the holy City, for the wonted worship and service of their GOD, but the Nobles would do just nothing. And thus it hath beene in all times, and is just so in our dayes. Meane men many times contribute very liberally, and farre above their ability to the pro|curement and maintenance of a profitable and powerfull Ministery: but the rich, worldly-wise, and gentlemen thereabouts, will not part with a
<PB N="178" REF="119">
penny for any such holy purpose. Such great men as these will by no meanes put their neckes, their power, and their purses to any such blessed worke of the LORD: though it be for the erecting of the Kingdome of IESVS CHRIST amongst them: for the illumination and refreshing of a darke and barren place with the light of the Gospell, and wa|ters of life, where both their owne soules, and many more about them are starving and bleeding to eternall death for want of heavenly food and ministeriall helpe. Nay, too many of them de|taining the Churches Patrimony, will neither re|store it to the proper native use and end: nor (which is very lamentable) part with a little porti|on of a large revenew in that kind towards a com|petency. Before you receive encouragement to go on in this course with comfort, I pray you pro|cure us (from your partakers, if there be any such) Answers to those many learned Treatises extant upon this argument, and (for any thing I know) ut|terly unanswered: especially, M^r. <HI>Bernards,</HI> D^r. <HI>Sclaters,</HI> and D^r. <HI>Fields.</HI> I know well some excellent spirits of late meerely out of the graci|ous freenesse of their truly noble dispositions, to their great honour, and adorning profession, have given backe to the Church for ever (I meane no|thing about buying in Impropriations, one of the most glorious works in that kinde (for any thing I know) that ever was undertaken in this King|dome) diverse Church-livings, some an hundred pound <HI>per annum,</HI> some sixe or seven score, some threescore, some one; so many as amount to the
<PB N="179" REF="119">
value of above seven hundred pounds yearely. But I must tell you also, they are onely such as you mis-call Puritan-gentlemen (for I neither heare nor know of any other that stirs this way) and how few such are to be found in a Countrey, every eye spiritually illightened may clearely see, and heartily bewaile. For, I meane none but such as are (in true search and censure) GODS best ser|vants, and the Kings best subjects.</P>
<P>I come in a second place to make the point ap|peare yet further by reasons. And first, such as are peculiar to the severall sorts of greatnesse&punc; all w^c^h (once for all) I understand such <HI>secundum mun|dum, secundum bominem, secundum carnem, according to the world, according to man, according to the flesh.</HI></P>
<P>And first for excellency of learning understood still after the flesh, implyed also by the Apostle in this place: as appeares by the former words: <HI>Where is the Scribe? Where is the Disputer of this world?</HI> Where are the learned Rabbins of the Iewes? Where are the profound Philosophers of the Gentiles? Let us take notice that learning of it selfe is a very lovely and illustrious thing, which made <HI>Aeneas Silvius</HI> in his Epistle to <HI>Sigis|mund</HI> Duke of Austria, say, <HI>If the face</HI> even <HI>of hu|mane learning could be seene, it is fairer and more beautifull than the morning or the evening-starre.</HI> But notwithstanding bent the wrong way, and spent upon private and pernicious ends, it becomes the fowlest fiend the Devill hath upon earth, and his<NOTE PLACE="marg">Degeneratio optimi pessi|ma.</NOTE> mightiest agent to do a world of mischiefe. No corruption is worse than of that which is best
<PB N="180" REF="120">
mis-imployed: it is of wofull consequence, pro|portionable to its native worth. And the longer and more prosperously it is imployed as an instru|ment of all, and in the service of Satan ever the more pestilently, which is for my purpose, doth it harden and enrage the heart against all means of grace, the power of godlinesse, and possibility of conversion.</P>
<P>Secondly, men of this world for the most part in the attainement and exercise of learning and knowledge propose to themselves, and finally rest upon many bastard, base, and degenerate ends: as, pleasure of curiosity, quiet of resolution, refi|ning and raising the spirit, ability of discourse, vi|ctory of wit, gaine of profession, ornament, and reputation, inablement for imployment and busi|nesse. Thus whereas variety and depth of know|ledge should properly and principally serve to prepare, fit, and furnish the soule wherein it is seat|ed: First, for a higher degree, and agreater mea|sure of sanctification in it selfe: secondly, to do GOD more excellent and glorious service: Thirdly, to do more nobly in <HI>Ephratha,</HI> and be more famous in <HI>Bethlehem:</HI> I meane, by an edi|fying and charitable influence to illuminate and better all about them: The most learned men have these worthy ends, and comply exactly with the world: hunting onely after by their knowledge, and aspiring towards (as their utmost aimes) certaine second prizes: as though they la|boured onely by their learning to find (as one sayes well:) <HI>a cowch whereupon to rest, a searching</HI>
<PB N="181" REF="120">
<HI>and a restlesse spirit: or a tarrasse for a wandring and variable mind, to walke up and downe with a faire pro|spect: or a tower of state, for a proud mind to raise it selfe upon: or a fort or commanding ground for strife and contention: or a shop for profit or sale: and not a rich store-house for the glory of the Creator, and the reliefe of mans estate.</HI> And so by the abuse and misapply|ing of it, they put their great engine, very power|full either for excellency of good, or excesse of ill, as it takes, into the Devils hands for the enlar|ging and advancement of his kingdome: and turne the edge of it to the dangerous hurt of o|thers: and so by consequent and by accident, it prooves a mighty barre to keepe CHRIST and His kingdome out of their hearts.</P>
<P>Let me in a word by an instance intimate unto you the traines and temptations to which they ex|pose themselves, the snares and curses which they incurre, who bend their abilities of learning, clo|sing with the corruptions of the time, to raise and enrich themselves; the two maine ends of the most in these covetous and ambitious dayes.</P>
<P>First, there is a plant in the nurceries of litera|ture of great expectation and hope: which being watered, and warmed at the well-heads of Acade|micall learning, and with the fruitfull heat of Pole|micall exercises and agitations in the Schooles, wherein the true worth and excellency of a Schol|ler consists, growes ripe and becomes remarka|ble; so that he heares after him in the streets a se|cret murmuring: <HI>This is the man: Dignum est mon|strarier &amp; dicier Hic est:</HI> Now by this time he be|gins
<PB N="182" REF="121">
to reflect with the eye of selfe-love, and many vaine-glorious glaunces upon his personall worth and publike applause: and then casts about what course to take. GODS principle and path is: It is better to be good, than great; religious, than rich: And therefore He would have him imploy and improove all his naturall and acquired en|dowments, all the powers and possibilities of bo|dy and soule upon His glory and service that gave them, and where they are more than infinitely due. And that when the good hand of divine pro|vidence shall bring him to any place for the exer|cise of his gifts and ministeriall imployment, he would there spend himselfe (like a shining and bur|ning lampe) in the illumination and salvation of GODS people: and so hereafter <HI>shine as the bright|nesse of the firmament</HI> in the highest heavens, and <HI>as the starres forever and ever.</HI> Nay, (saies the Devill) that's a sowre, strict, precise way: It is not meet, that such admired eminency of learned parts should be confined to such obscurity, that such rare gifts and depth of knowledge should be lost upon high shoes, and amongst a number of rude, ignorant, and uncapable clownes: and therefore he labours to raise his spirit to higher hopes: and would have him plunge presently into the current of the times, and become somebody in the world. Hereupon (his heart already ravisht with the plea|sing apprehension of worldly glory and humane greatnesse, represented by Satan in the most allu|ring formes to his ambitious imagination) he re|solves fearfully against his owne soule, to follow
<PB N="183" REF="121">
the streame, to ply the present, and plot all meanes and wayes of preferment: after which ordinarily every step towards an high roome, or to be hasti|ly rich, is a snare and curse unto him: and there|fore at the height, he must needs be holden fast in the clutches of Satan. He now begins upon all occasions to disclaime all things that tend to pre|cisenesse, and in his deportment drawes nearer to good fellowship: he remits and interrupts his care and constancy in study, and studies how to under|stand the world, negotiate for advancement, and humour the times: He merrily derides <HI>Doctrine and Vse,</HI> as they scoffingly call it: all edifying plainnesse and <HI>foolishnesse</HI> of preaching: and now he digs with much adoe perhaps a whole quarter of a yeare into the rotten dunghils of Popish Po|stillers, and phantasticall Friers, and from thence patches together many gayish and gaudy shreds of painted bables, and frothy conceipts and tricks of wit; and at length comes out with a selfe-seeking Sermon: just like that discourse which King IAMES compares to a corne-field in harvest, pe|stered with red and blew flowers; which choake and eat up all the good graine. For, he well knowes this is the way to ingratiate himselfe into the times, and gratifie those great ones who desire farre more to have their eares tickled, than their consciences toucht; and would rather have pil|lowes sowed under their arme-holes by such de|ceiving dawbers, that they may lie more softly upon the bed of security; than the keene arrowes of righteousnesse and truth fastned in their sides
<PB N="184" REF="122">
by GODS faithfull messengers to drive them to si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">cerity: and yet after this, he must serve his time in serving the times: and through many mi|series of secular martyrdome, as <HI>Peter Blesensis</HI> cals it, and many shipwracks of a good conscience, by basenesse, flattering, attending, depending, and un|doing his soule. At last (if he die not in the pursuit, as many have done) besides all these precedent miserable meanes, by present simony, or some o|ther vile services: he comes into some high place, or at least becomes a negligent, non-resi|dent, or insatiable pluralist. Which wicked en|trance being accompanied with GODS curse, his heart already so hardened, his ministeriall strength and veine of learning so wasted and dried up by discontinuance, desuetude, and worldly dealings: having now attained his ends, he drownes him|selfe over head and eares either in secular busi|nesses, or sensuall pleasures to muffle up the mouth of his horribly guilty conscience: cries downe preaching, opposeth the power of god|linesse: and so becomes rather a wolfe than a shep|heard.</P>
<P>In a second place. The rich worldling also is in a wofull case this way, as appeares by CHRISTS owne words, <HI>Matth.</HI> 19. 23, 24. which is further confirmed by casting our eyes upon <HI>Luk.</HI> 16. 14. and 1 <HI>Tim. 6. 9. Luke 16. 19. And the Pharises which were covetous heard all these things, and de|rided him.</HI> And what heard they from CHRIST? That it was impossible to serve GOD and Mam|mon. So that there are some passages ever in a faith|full
<PB N="185" REF="122">
and searching ministry, which covetous world|lings deride, and will not downe with by any meanes, but resolutely reject in their carnall wis|dome as very foolish, unnecessary, precise, and no waies to be given way unto. Especially such as these. 1. That they must restore whatsoever they have any waies gotten, or detaine wrongfully and wickedly. 2. That they must rather themselves starve, and leave their children in beggery, than put their hands to any unlawfull waies or meanes of getting: so much as to tell a lie, &amp;c. 3. That <HI>godlinesse is great gaine,</HI> and that it is incomparably better to be religious than rich, good than great. 4. That there is a life of faith which will keepe a man in sweet contentment in any estate, should he be never so poore. 5. That <HI>Iob</HI> was truly richer with CHRIST alone, than when before he was loaden with abundance of thicke clay. 6. That riches are nothing, <HI>Proverbes 23. 5. Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not?</HI> 7. That they must leave all for CHRIST. 8. That if they part with all for Him, they shalbe recompenced an hun|dred fold in this life. 9. That if they had no recompence at all in this world, yet the re|ward that they shall have in the world to come, wilbe a super-abundant recompence.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding these satisfactory and uncon|trollable principles, they <HI>will be rich</HI> in the Apo|stles sense; after they have gotten a golden heape, will be more rich still: and therefore are easily tempted unto, and taken in the snare of that exe|crable
<PB N="186" REF="123">
and most abhorred trade of usury. In the exercise whereof they still negotiate with the De|vill, and receive all their increase at the Devils hands: and therefore how is it possible they should turne on GODS side? And that usurers trade with the Devill, and have their usurious mo|ney from him. Heare the judgement of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hom. Vol. 2.</NOTE> Church of ENGLAND, to which ordinarily all<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hom. 17. pag.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">.</NOTE> Ministers subscribe; <HI>Verily so many as increase themselves by usury,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>They have their goods of the Devils gift.</HI> Heare also the judgement of the State even of the King, the Nobility, and the whole Body of the Kingdome in Parliament; and in that Statute whence usurers take very falsly some en|couragement, as though it were allow'd; which is most untrue. These are the words in the begin|ning of the Statute: <HI>Forasmuch as all usury being forbidden by the Law of</HI> GOD, <HI>is a sinne, and detesta|ble,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">13. <HI>Eliz. cap.</HI> 8.</NOTE> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Thirdly, though an high place be holden in the false opinion of vaine men, the onely heaven up|on earth: yet in truth, and upon triall, by acci|dent it prooves Satans surest hold to hamper them in his strongest and most inextricable snares, untill he tumble them hence with a more desperate and headlong downefall into the pit of hell. For, as those of truest worth are ever timerous, and most retiring in such cases; so the worst men ordinari|ly are most ambitious and aspiring. Consider for the purpose the unambitious modesty and magna|nimity of the olive-tree, fig-tree, and the vine: but the base and worthlesse bramble, a dry, empty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iudg. 9.</NOTE>

saplesse kex and weed, apt and able only to scratch, teare, and vexe, must needs be up and be hoised in|to an high room, and domineere over others&punc; Men of most prostituted consciences are for the most part the most pragmatical prowlers after undeser|ved preferments: and the only men to serve them|selves <HI>vijs &amp; modis,</HI> (as they say) into offices, ho|nours, and places of advancement. For, they want honest wit to conceive and fore-see the waight of the charge, &amp; conscience to discharge it faithfully. Now then, where there is a concurrence of cor|rupt times, a wicked wit, a wide conscience, and a vast gluttonous desire to domineere. What will not be done to attaine their ends? They will not sticke to lie, dissemble, breake their words, for|sweare, machiavellize, practise any policy or counterpolicy to honesty, reason, religion, to flat|ter, raise a faction, humour the times, supplant competitours, gratifie the Devill, do any thing. We may proportionably conceive the malignity of inferiour ambitions by the monstrousnesse of higher aspirations. <HI>Now who hath not observed (saith that learned Knight in his Preface to the History of the World) what labour, practice, perill, bloud-shed, and cruelty the Kings and Princes of the world have un|dergone, exercised, and taken on them to make them|selves and their issues masters of the world? Oh by what plots, by what forswearings, betrayings, oppressions, im|prisonments, tortures, poysonings, and under what rea|sons of State, and politicke subtilty have these fore-na|med Kings,</HI> &amp;c. By this time these men by these meanes are mounted (I will suppose) on horse|backe,

and have left many Princes walking as ser|vants upon the earth: And folly is set in great dignity. And what then? Then do they begin so to swell with pride, untill they are ready to burst againe with over-weening of their owne worth, selfe-opinion and selfe-estimation: and to toyle extremely with revengefull inward indignation a|gainst all good men: whose hearts (as they con|ceive) and their consciences tell them (there was just cause) did rise against their growing great and rising. Being thus empoysoned at the first en|trance with pride, selfe-conceiptednesse, preju|dice, revengefull jealousies, and other exorbitant and base distempers they begin to consider and re|solve how to behave themselves in their new pur|chased place. And we must know there is too much truth in that principle of policy in <HI>Tacitus: Never any came to an high roome wrongfully, and un|worthily:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nemo un|quam imperi|um flagitio quaesitum bo|nis artibus ex|ercuit. <HI>Hist. lib. 1. pag.</HI> 417.</NOTE> <HI>but he exercis'd his power and authority wic|kedly and unjustly.</HI> They therefore pitch presently upon such conclusions as these: We will plea|sure our friends, though we prey upon the pub|like, or pinch some peevish precise fellowes, which can well beare it: we will plague our ene|mies; we must above all, manage matters with a fit correspondency to accomplish our owne ends; especially to enrich our selves, raise our kindred, make way to rise higher, and greaten our posteri|ty; we must looke big, and sometimes amaze the multitude with some acts of awfulnesse and ter|rour, to procure and preserve respect, feare, and all attributions proper to our place: and let me tell
<PB N="189" REF="124">
you by the way; <HI>He that suspecteth his owne worth, or other mens opinions, thinking that lesse regard is had of his person, than he believes is due to his place, holds it good policy to spend all the force of his authority in purchasing the name of a severe man. For, the af|fected sowrenesse of a vaine fellow doth many times re|semble the gravity of one that is wise: and the feare wherein they live which are subject to oppression, caries a shew of reverence to him that does the wrong, at least it serves to dazle the eyes of underlings, keeping them from prying into the weakenesse of such as have jurisdi|ction over them,</HI> &amp;c. Beside all this, men in great place are liable, and expos'd daily to moe and stronger temptations, than men of lower ranks. Honour, wealth, worldly reputation, earthly fa|vours, &amp;c. are Satans snares to entangle and tie them faster to their fooles paradise and admired folly; and as golden fetters, to chaine them un|mooveably to their noble slavery.</P>
<P>Secondly, great men are for the most part (and it is one of their greatest miseries) so enclosed and beleager'd with flatterers, the basest of slaves, with sycophants, false-hearted followers, selfe|seekers, &amp;c. that very hardly (if at all) can any ho|nest man or faithfull <HI>Micaiah</HI> have accesse, come neare them, or at any time be heard with patience, especially either to tell them the truth, or wisely and humbly reprove them for their faults.</P>
<P>Thirdly, those that are verst in story, shall find many and many a time this property put upon<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mallent ca|dere qu&agrave;m lo|co cedere.</NOTE> men in high place; to be throwne into the grave, or from their greatnesse, is both one to them. For

first, they so delight in domineering, and dote up|on their high roome as their dearest Idoll: And withall they know full well, that as in naturall pri|vation there is no returne to habit, so it is very rarely seene in the privation politique, and point of preferment; that they would even rather die, than be dejected.</P>
<P>Lay now these two points together: and count all the snares from which poorer and private men by reason of their meaner condition are happily exempted: And no marvell though <HI>not many mighty,</HI> either in heapes of wealth, or height of places, be converted, or go to heaven.</P>
<P>In the fourth place: what a strong hold for the powers of hell, and mighty barre to keepe out grace, worldly wisdome is; may appeare by ta|king notice of the nature of it, and so of its noto|riously pestilent properties. This wisdome of the flesh springing from the principles of carnall rea|son, and precepts of humane policie, and recei|ving continuall influence and instigation from that old wily serpent to go on still in his and the worlds waies, doth with a proud disdainfulnesse and im|perious contempt scorne the great mysteries of godlinesse, foolishnesse of preaching, simplicity of the Saints, and society of the brotherhood: crosseth directly, and contradicts the counsell and commands of GODS Spirit, in all motions to good, and matters of salvation: accounts in good earnest holinesse hypocrisie, sanctification singu|larity, profession and practice of sincerity precise|nesse, the great things of GODS Law as a strange

thing: In all its consultations concludes ever things pleasing to flesh and bloud; and ends at last with extremest folly and utter confusion. Wit|nesse <HI>Achitophel,</HI> who was wise enough to set his house in order, and yet wanted wit to rescue his owne life out of his owne hands: he was curi|ous to provide for his family after his death, and had no care at all to preserve himselfe from eter|nall death: was not this a madnesse even to <HI>mira|cle,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Amentia us|qu&egrave; ad prodi|gium.</NOTE> as Divines speake?

<P>The Spirit of GOD intimates unto us the pe|stilency of its properties, <HI>Iames</HI> 3. 15. It is, First, <HI>Earthly.</HI> Secondly, <HI>Sensuall.</HI> Thirdly, <HI>De|villish.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Devillish:</HI> for, it imitateth the Devill in plot|ting and contriving mischiefe and ruine against the glory of GODS Majesty, and Ministry of His Word. It tasts of his hellish wilinesse in close conveyances and secret infidiations, for the under|mining, supplanting, and confounding of the pas|sage of the Gospell, and plantation of grace in the hearts of men. Satan (you know) is ever fierce and furious, when he spies but the least glimpse of GODS truth, or sparke of grace to peepe our and breake forth at any time, or in any place. When the glorious sun-shine of the Gospell did in these latter times of the world (according to the Pro|phecie in the <HI>Revelations</HI>) arise out of the dark|some&punc;
<PB N="192" REF="126">
night, and dangerou fogs of Popery, and be|gun graciously to inlighten many thousand soules which lay in darknesse, and under the shadow of death, with what strange and prodigious rage did the great Dragon presently ascend out of his bot|tomlesse pit.</P>
<P>Since that time what furious martyring of the Saints, what horrible murthering of Kings, what bloudy massacres, what invincible <HI>Armadoes,</HI> what hellish powder-plots, what devouring of Martyrs, by that bloud-thirsty monster the Spa|nish Inquisition, what hatefull imprisonings, what desperate conspiracies, what a deale of hell hath vext and rent the face of Europe, and shaken the pillars of this part of the world: as though all the fiends in hell, and whole armies of those damned spirits were broke loose, to cast the Christian world into a new Chaos of darknesse, combustion and confusion. And all this hath beene the De|vils doings of pure spite and malice against the light of the Gospell, and power of the Word. The Pope, Iesuites, and their wicked adherents have beene indeed the instruments and executioners of all these bloudy miseries, but Satan himselfe was the principall agent. The cursed influence of all this wrath and rage was inspir'd from him, and e|very particular and circumstance of all these mis|chiefes was first plotted in hell, before they were acted upon earth.</P>
<P>2. In our owne kingdome also his spite and malice against the light of the Gospell hath beene notorious and transcendent since the Word of
<PB N="193" REF="126">
truth hath growne powerfull amongst us. With what strange fury and malice hath Satan bestirred himselfe? What a deale of deare and innocent bloud did that red Dragon drinke up in Queene <HI>Maries</HI> time? For five yeares space the fire of persecution did flame in this land, and the sacred bodies of our glorious blessed Martyrs were sacri|ficed amids the mercilesse fury thereof: Afterward what a blacke and bloudy catalogue of most hate|full and prodigious conspiracies did run parallell with that golden time of Queene ELIZABETHS life, that (now) glorious Saint of dearest memory? But in all this hellish rage the Devill never played the Devill indeed, untill he came to the gun-pow|der-plot; that was such a piece of service against the light of y^e Gospell, as the Sun never saw before; the sons of men never heard of, hel it self never hatcht. Since Satan fel from heaven, and a Church was first planted upon y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> earth, there was never any thing in that kind which made the Devils Malice more fa|mous, GODS mercies more glorious, that Priest of <HI>Rome</HI> and his bloudy superstition more odious; or that cast such a shame and obloquy upon the in|nocency of Christian Religion. And all this was the Devils doing of pure spite and malice against the glory of the Gospell, the power of the Word, and the Saints of GOD. I say he was the arch|plotter and first moover of all these mischiefes. The Pope, and Iesuites, and their cursed confede|rates were indeed his instruments, executioners and agents, as we well know, and some of the Priests themselves confesse. <HI>See Quodl.</HI> 7. <HI>Act.</HI> 8. <HI>pag.</HI> 199.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="127">Scarce was that blessed Queene and incompara|ble Lady warme in her Princely Throne; but Sa|tan sets on the Pope <HI>Pius Quintus,</HI> he sends from <HI>Rome</HI> two Popish Priests, <HI>Morton</HI> and <HI>Webbe</HI> with a Bull of excommunication; whereby the subjects and people of the Kingdome were in a Popish sense discharg'd and assoil'd from their allegiance, loyaltie and obedience to her Majestie. They sol|licit the two traiterous Earles of the North, <HI>Nor|thumberland</HI> and <HI>Westmerland,</HI> to be the executio|ners of this bloudy Bull, which indeed was the fountaine and foundation of all the succeeding horrible plots and barbarous treacheries. <HI>See Bells Anatomy of Popish tyrannie, in his Epist. Dedic.</HI> a little booke called <HI>The executioner of justice in En|gland,</HI> &amp;c. I pray GOD now at length turne these Popish murderous hearts from whetting any moe swords to shed the bloud of the LORDS an|nointed: or returne the sharpe swords from the point with a cutting edge on both sides, even up to the very hilts into their owne hearts bloud. O LORD, let the King flourish with a crowne of glory upon his head, and a Scepter of triumph in his hand, and still wash his Princely feet in the bloud of his enemies.</P>
<P>3. This spitefull rage and furious oposition of Sa|tan against the power of the word, appears also by daily experience in those towns &amp; parishes; where by the mercies of GOD, a conscionable Ministry is planted; before, while Satan ruled and raigned a|mongst them, by his wicked deputies, ignorance, prophanenes, Popish superstitions, sinful vanities,
<PB N="195" REF="127">
lewd sports, prophanation of the Saboth, filthines, drunkennes, and such other accursed Pursevants for Hell: Why then all was well, all was in quiet and in peace. O then that was a merry world, and as good a Towne for good-fellowship, as was in all the Country. And no marvaile: when a strong armed man keepeth his Pallace, the things that he possesseth are in peace. <HI>Luke</HI> 11. 21. While Sathan sits in their hearts, and rules in their Consciences; he suffers them to have their swings in their furi|ous vanities and wicked pleasures, without any great disturbance or contradiction. And com|monly he never sets prophane people together by the eares and at odds, but when his owne king|dome may be more strengthened, and their soules more endanger'd by dissention, than by their par|taking in prophanenesse, and brotherhood in ini|quity. Let it not seeme strange then, when townes and parishes where conscionable meanes are wanting, live merrily and pleasantly; for, they walke together in the knot of good-fellow|ship, through the broad way, they follow the course of their owne corruptions, and swing of their corrupt affection, and swim downe the cur|rent of the times, and are at Satans beck to do him any desperate and notorious service at all assaies, in all passages of prophanenesse, and offices of im|piety and rebellion: but bring amongst such a powerfull Ministerie, which takes a right course for the plantation of grace, and salvation of their soules: and then marke how spitefully and furi|ously Satan begins to bestirre himselfe; besides
<PB N="196" REF="128">
his owne malice and machinations, he presently sets on foot and on fire too all that belong unto him in his instigation. They band and combine themselves with great rage and indignation a|gainst the power of the Word, and the faithfull messengers of GOD. They fret, and fume, picke unnecessary quarrels, raile, slander, and indeed foame out filthily their owne shame, in disgracing the truth of GOD without all truth or conscience: and il Satan spies any poore soule amongst them to be pulled out of his clutches and kingdome of darknesse by the preaching of the Word, he pre|sently sets all the rest upon him as so many dogged curres, or rather furious wolves (for so our blessed Saviour makes the comparison) upon a harmelesse lambe; he whets (like sharpe razors) all the lying and lewd tongues in the towne, and tips them with the very fire of hell; so that they plead for pro|phanenesse, prophaning the Sabbath, and many sinfull fooleries and vanities in all places where they come. He makes those who have a little more wit, his close factors and under-hand-dea|lers: for that stands not with Satans policy, and the reputation of the worldly-wise, that them|selves should be open actors in childish vanities, and profes'd enemies to the Law of GOD: they do him sufficient service by being secret patrons and protectors of impiety, counsellers and coun|tenancers of the works of darknesse: he fils the mouthes of the ignorant with slanderous com|plaints and cries, that there was neuer good world since there was so much knowledge: that there
<PB N="197" REF="128">
was never more preaching, but never lesse work|ing: whereas (poore soules) they never yet knew what grace or good work meant, or scarce good word: but their naughty tongues, and hatred to be reformed, are true causes why both the world and places where they live, are farre worse. Those that are desperately and notoriously naught, he in|forces and inrages like mad dogs; so that they im|pudently and openly barke at, and with their im|poysoned fangs furiously snatch at that hurtlesse hand which would heale and bind up their bleed|ing soules: they are like dogs barking at the moone; for, GODS Ministers are starres in the right hand of CHRIST, <HI>Revel.</HI> 1. 16. If they would do them any deadly harme, they must plucke them thence; but let them take heed how they be bold and busie that way, lest at last they take a beare by the tooth, and awake a sleep|ing lion.</P>
<P>Thus you see what a stirre the Devill keepes when he is like to be driven from his hold by the power of the Word: and how he playes the De|vill indeed, when the light of the Gospell begins to shine in a place which himselfe hath long kept in darknesse and errour by those twofold fiends, ignorance and prophanenesse. Perhaps at the ve|ry first rising of that glorious sun of the Word of life unto a people that hath sit in darknesse and un|der the shadow of death, it breeds onely astonish|ment and amazement, they are for a while onely dazelled with the glory and beauty of so rare and extraordinary a light, but when after some little
<PB N="198" REF="129">
space they be thorowly heated, and it begin to burne up their noy some lusts, to gall their guilty consciences, to sting their carnall hearts, to vexe and disquiet their covetous affections, then begins all the stirre, and Satan to play his part: the sud|den infliction of a wound is not so very painefull, and while it is greene it is not so grievous, but af|ter, when it comes to be searched in cold bloud, to have tents put into it, and corrasives applied, then it goeth to the heart: When the sword of the Spi|rit first strikes the carnall heart, it may perhaps beare away the blow reasonable well; but if the Chirurgion of the soule, I meane the Minister of the Word follow his cure faithfully, and open the wound wider, as he sees need, apply spirituall cor|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">osives to eat away the ranknesse of the flesh, and the poyson of sinne, then begins the prophane man (if the LORD give him not grace to suffer his soule to be saved) to rage and rave with the smart of it, and perhaps with malice and fury to fly into the face of his soules Physitian.</P>
<P>See the humour of prophane men against the power of a conscionable Ministery, <HI>Ier.</HI> 44. 15, &amp;c. <HI>Acts</HI> 13. 8. and Cap. 14. 2, &amp;c. and Ver. 19. and Cap. 16. 19. and Cap. 17. 5. and Ver. 32. and Cap. 19. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">. and 24. 5.</P>
<P>This spite and malice of Satan against sincerity and grace is to be seene also in private families: if the governours of the house, the children and ser|vants be all prophane (as it is very true of very ma|ny in most places) then they are passing well met for matter of Religion, and were there nothing
<PB N="199" REF="129">
amongst them to breed difference and dissention, but GODS service, they would never fall out: for they are all content to heare no more, or more of|ten of the affaires of heaven, judgements for sin, the wayes of GOD, and reformation of their life, than they must needs: they are all willing and for|ward to prophane the Sabbath, in one kind or o|ther; some by absenting themselves from the house of GOD, some by worldly talke all the day long, some by idlenesse, some by sinfull sports, &amp;c. They are well content to lie downe at night, like wild beasts in their dens, without lifting up their hearts together unto that mercifull GOD which hath preserved and prospered them all the day: to rise up also in the morning, prayerlesse, or onely with formall prayers. They all joyne in malice against the Ministry of the Word, in slan|derous lies against the messengers of GOD, in base and reviling speeches against the professours of Christianity. The reason is, they are all pos|sessed with the same spirit of prophanenesse, love of pleasures, hatred to be reformed, and carnality of heart. But if it once please the LORD to plant grace in the heart of the Master of the family; so that he begin to plant in his house reformation, houshold instruction, prayer, sanctification of the Sabbath, and other holy orders, and godly exer|cises; then presently begins the Devill to stir in the hearts and tongues of their prophane servants: they begin to be furiously impatient of such pre|cisenesse, strictnesse, and restraints (for so they wickedly and wrongfully call the pleasures of
<PB N="200" REF="130">
grace and way to heaven) they can by no meanes digest such new fashions: they'l not be troubled with giving account of Sermons they heare: they'l have their recreation on the Sabbath, that they will: they'l not be mew'd up at home, when other mens servants are at their sports abroad, &amp;c. Nay perhaps even their owne children (except the LORD season them with the same grace) may grow stubborne and refractory, and very rebelli|ous and disobedient to the best things: so that in a holy sense, CHRISTS words may be there truly verified, <HI>Matth.</HI> 10. 34, 35. Thus was zealous <HI>David</HI> troubled with the vanity of a scornefull, proud, and prophane wife, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 5. 20. <HI>Abel</HI> with a bloudy brother, <HI>Gen.</HI> 4. 8. <HI>Iacob</HI> with a pro|phane <HI>Esau, Gen.</HI> 27. 41. <HI>Isaac</HI> with a mocking <HI>Ish|mael:</HI> And many a gracious heart in families where grace beares not sway, with the lewdnesse, malice, and ungodly oppositions of those among whom they live.</P>
<P>Or if it so fall out that the power of grace seaze on the heart of a servant or sonne, so that he begin to be sensible of the ignorance, disorders, pro|phanenesse, and sinfull confusions of the house where he dwels: desires to spend the Sabbath as Christians use to do: then presently begins Satan to put rage into the heart, and frownings into the face of the father or master of the family: he then takes on, tels him, that such precisenesse is not for his profit, hee'l have no such inferiour fellow to be a reformer of his family: hee'l not be control|led and contradicted in his owne house, hee'l go|verne
<PB N="201" REF="130">
his people in the old fashion as his father did before him, &amp;c. so that there is no longer biding for that new convert under such a crabbed master, without a very great deale of patience. All this, and a thousand more mischiefes are the blacke broods and bloudy effects of Satans malice a|gainst the power of the Word, and the plantation of grace.</P>
<P>GOD Himselfe is the GOD of peace, CHRIST IESVS the Prince of peace, and the blessed Spirit is the fountaine of peace, that passeth all understan|ding, the holy Word is the Gospell of peace, the faithfull Ministers are the Messengers of reconci|liation and peace, the Saints of GOD are the children of peace: The Divell and the rebellious corruptions of prophane men are indeed and truth the true causes of all these stirs and strong opposi|tions, which are raised any where, at any time, any waies in the case and cause of Religion. The fault I confesse, and imputation of troublesomenesse is lai'd upon GODS children by the lewd tongues of gracelesse men. See <HI>Ier.</HI> 15. 10. utterly without cause. 1. <HI>Kings</HI> 18. 17. <HI>Act.</HI> 24. 3 <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but these and the like are lies hatch't in Hell, and managed by the malice of carnall men. And that was most true, which the blessed Prophet of GOD <HI>Elijah,</HI> and the holy Apostle Saint <HI>Paul</HI> answered in such cases, 1. <HI>Kings</HI> 18. 18. <HI>Act.</HI> 24. 13, 14. and so proportionably may all Christians answer all pro|phane wretches amongst whom they liue: It is you and your prophane families, your proud ig|norance, hatred to be reformed, malice against the
<PB N="202" REF="131">
Ministery, &amp;c. which trouble <HI>Israel,</HI> are the true causes of all Dissentions and disquietnesse, and bring upon us all these plagues and judgements which any way afflict us. A godly Minister stands at staves end with all the world, and hath the most enemies of any man. He must warre not onely with desperate swaggerers and notorious sinners, but also with civill honest men, formall Professors, counterfeit Christians, unsound converts, relap|sed creatures, &amp;c.</P>
<P>5. Lastly, That particular person, whom it plea|ses the LORD to sanctifie and set apart for his ser|vice, hath good experience of Satans fury and rage against sincerity and grace: there is not a man that passeth out of the powers of darkenesse and Satans bondage, by the power of the word, but he presently pursues him farre more furiously, then ever <HI>Pharaoh</HI> did the Israelites, to recover and re|gaine him into his kingdome. <HI>See my discourse of Happinesse, pag.</HI> 60.</P>
<P>Thus I have given you a taste of the Divells malice and machinations against the light of the Gospell, the power of GODS truth, and the Ministery of the Word: now you must under|stand that worldly wisdome is his very righthand, nearest counsellor and chiefest champion in all these mischievous plots and furious outrages a|gainst GOD and goodnesse. This hath beene more then manifest in all ages of the Church: In those great Politicians, the Scribes and Pharisees; in the States-men of <HI>Rome;</HI> in our times, and a|mongst us daily: worldly-wise men, that are only
<PB N="203" REF="131">
guided by carnall reason, they imploy their wit, their power, their malice, their friends, their un|der-hand dealings, their policy and their purses too, unlesse they be too covetous; to hinder, stop, disgrace, and slander the passage of a conscionable Ministery and the Messengers of Almighty GOD, of whom the LORD hath said, <HI>Touch not mine an|nointed, and doe my Prophets no harme, Psal.</HI> 105. 15. They ever imitate and follow to a haires bredth their Father the Divell in malice and practise a|gainst grace and good men; except sometimes they forbeare for a time for advantage, for reputa|tion; or such other by-respects and private ends: except naturally they be extraordinarily ingenu|ous, and of very loving and kinde naturall disposi|tions; or bee restrained by feare of some re|markable judgement, from persecution of the Ministers.</P>
<P>2. As worldly wisdome is divelish, as Saint <HI>Iames</HI> calls it, and ever mixed with a spice of Hel|lish malice and virulency against the Kingdome of CHRIST: so it is also earthly, for it mindes onely earthly things, and though that casts beyond the Moone for matters of the world, yet it hath not an inch of forecast for the world to come: But though a man be to passe, perhaps the next day, nay the next houre, nay the next moment, to that dreadfull Tribunall of GOD, and to an un|avoideable everlasting estate in another world, either in the joyes of heaven, or in the paines of hell, yet it so glues and nailes his hopes, desires, projects, and resolutions to transitory pelfe, and
<PB N="204" REF="132">
things of this life, as though both body and soule at their dissolution, should be wholly and e|verlastingly resolved, and turned into earth, dust, or nothing.</P>
<P>To give you a taste of this earthlinesse of worldly wisdome, give me a worldly-wise man, and,</P>
<P>1. Put him into discourse of the affaires of the world, and the businesse of his calling, and you shall find him profound and deepe in this argu|ment, able to speake well and to the purpose, if it were a whole day, and that with dexterity and cheerfulnesse: But divert his discourse a little, and turne him into talke of matters of heaven, of the great mystery of godlinesse, the secrets of sanctifi|cation, cases of conscience, and such like holy con|ference; and you shall find him to be a very in|fant, an ideot: it may be, he may say something of the generall points of Religion, of matters in controversie, of the meaning of some places in Scripture: but come to conferre of practicall dig|nity, experimentall knowledge, passages of Chri|stianity, and practices of grace, and you shall find him, and he shall shew himselfe to be able to say just nothing with feeling and comfort: many a poore neglected Christian, which in the spirit of disdainfulnesse, and out of the pride of his carnall wisdome, he tramples upon with contempt, and would scorne to be matcht with in other matters: yet would infinitely surpasse him in this case; quite put him downe, that he would have nothing to say.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="132">2. Let him come to some great personage with a suit, to intreat his favour and countenance, or to give him thanks for some former good turn: and he will be able to speake well, plausibly, pleasingly, persuasively, and seasonably: but put him to pray in his family unto Almighty GOD for the pardon of his sins, and a crowne of life, for the remoovall of damnation and an everlasting curse; to powre out his soule in thankfulnesse for every good thing he enjoyeth (for he holds all from Him) and such a wise man (which is strange and fearefull) in a businesse of so great weight, will not be a|ble to speake scarce one wise word without a booke.</P>
<P>3. Come into his family, examine the estate of his house, you shall find all things in good order, every affaire marshalled and disposed for the best advantage, a provident fore-cast, and present provision of things necessary for their bodies: E|very one busie in their severall imployments, and carefull in the workes of their calling: but search also into the estate of their soules, what heavenly food is ministred for their spirituall life, how the Sabbath is sanctified among them, how it stands with them for houshold-instructions and family|exercises, &amp;c. And (GOD knowes) in that re|gard, that way there is no providence at all, no care, no conscience about any such matters.</P>

<P>4. Consider His care and affection towards His children; you shall finde that to be all earth: for whereas perhaps with farrelesse toyle and tra|vaile, by the mercies of GOD, by teaching them the feare of GOD, instructing them in the wayes of godlinesse, restraining them from prophanenesse, and prophaning the Sabbath, by his owne exam|ple of piety and godly conversation, he might plant grace in their hearts, and provide a crowne of glory for their heads hereafter: yet (wretched man) he doth not onely wickedly neglect these meanes of everlasting comfort: but with too much worldlinesse, variety of vexations (and per|haps for his very wickednesse that way, if there were nothing else) with the great danger of his owne soule; he heapes up for them those hoards,

that will hereafter heape coales of vengeance on their heads; and purchases and provides for them those greene pastures of a prosperous state in this world wherein they are fatted for the same slaugh|ter, and thorow which they prophanely passe into the pit of the same endlesse destruction with him|selfe.</P>
<P>5. Aske his judgement about the Sabbath, and ordinarily you shall find his resolution to be this; that he sees no reason but mens servants and chil|dren may enjoy some houres of recreation and sport even upon the Sabbath, especially with ex|ception of times of Divine Service: what would they have us to do, (will he say) or what would they make of us? I hope they doe not looke we should be Angels upon earth: they know, we are but flesh and bloud. It is too true indeed, this ca|villing against the keeping of the Sabbath savours full rankly of flesh and bloud.</P>
<P>GOD out of the abundance of His owne goodnesse, and compassionate consideration of our weakenesse hath allotted and allowed unto us six dayes for our owne businesse, and reserved but one to be consecrated in speciall manner, as glori|ous unto Him; and yet wretched men, they must needs clip the LORDS coyne, encroach upon His sanctified time, and unthankfully and accursedly spend those holy houres in which they should treasure up knowledge and comfort against that fearefull day, in idlenesse, worldinesse, and pro|phane pastimes, whereby besides the particular curse upon their owne soules, they many times
<PB N="208" REF="134">
draw many miseries and plagues upon the place where they live. This reason is carnall indeed, this wisdome is earthly with a witnesse.</P>
<P>6. Add another out of <HI>Luke</HI> 12. 39, 40.</P>
<P>Thus you see worldly wisdome in all that con|sultation and cariages inclines unto the earth, pro|vides ever with greatest care for the world, and savours rankly of flesh and bloud.</P>
<P>3. It is also <HI>sensuall:</HI> for, it doth senslesly pre|ferre the pleasures of sense and pleasing the appe|tite, before the peace of conscience and sense of GODS favour. It provides a thousand times bet|ter for a body of earth, which must shortly upon an unavoidable necessity, feed the wormes, and turne to dust; than for a precious immortall foule, the immediate issue of GODS almightinesse, and which can never possibly die: It doth with grea|ter sweetnesse and hold-fast, relish, apprehend and enjoy the furious delights of some bosome-sinne, which it hath in present pursuit, taste and possessi|on, than spirituall graces, GODS favour, joy in that blessed Spirit, and a crowne of life hereafter; for which it hath GODS Word and Promise, if it would be wise to salvation. In a word: it doth so highly preferre a few bitter-sweet pleasures for an inch of time in this vale of teares, before un|mixed and immeasurable joyes thorow all eterni|ty in the glorious mansions of heaven: Is not this wisdome strangely nailed and glued unto sense, and stupidly senslesse in spirituall things, that though many times fore-told and fore-warned by the Ministry of the Word, yet will needs for the
<PB N="209" REF="134">
temporary satisfaction of its carnall, covetous, or ambitious humour, with filthy vexing, transitory pelfe, with vanity, dung, nothing, run wilfully and headlong upon easelesse, endlesse, and remedilesse torments in the world to come? And that which is the just curse and plague of worldly wisdome, (this spirituall madnesse commonly called) it is confident that it doth wisely, and takes the best way, and thereupon becomes incorrigible and obstinate: <HI>For there is more hope of a foole, than of him that is wise in his owne conceipt, Prov.</HI> 26. 22. And, <HI>Though thou shouldest bray a foole in a morter, yet will not his foolishnesse depart from him, Prov.</HI> 27. 22. How fearefull then is his case, that to his worldly wisdome joynes confidence in his wayes? But the day will come that hee'l see and bewaile the vani|ty of his wisdome, and the truth of his folly, and that with bitter griefe and horrible anguish even in hell fire, as it is notably set downe in the booke of <HI>Wisdome,</HI> Cap. 5.</P>
<P>But the word which here in <HI>Iames</HI> is rendred <HI>sensuall,</HI> is the same which is used, 1 <HI>Corinth.</HI> 2. 14. <HI>The naturall man receiveth not the things,</HI> &amp;c. <GAP DESC="foreign">.</P>
<P>So that worldly wisdome is in that sense natu|rall: that it can neither relish nor receive the things of the spirit: it cannot possibly conceive and comprehend the immediate meanes and my|steries of salvation: let a man otherwise be never so faire and comely in body, never so proportio|nable, personable, or goodly to look upon, and in the eye of others, yet if himselfe want eyes (the
<PB N="210" REF="135">
instruments of light, he cannot possibly behold and gaze upon with delight the goodlinesse and glory of this great frame of the world about him: he cannot see the brightnesse of the Sun, the beau|ty of the earth, and the delightsome variety of the creatures: so a worldly-wise man, though he be never so gracefull for his other parts, never so ad|mirable to carnall eyes, or mightily magnifi dby his flatterers or favourites: yet wanting the saving sight of GODs sanctifying Spirit, and the eye of spirituall understanding, is starke blind in spirituall matters, and cannot possibly behold the rich pa|radise of the kingdome of grace, the secrets of san|ctification, and the incomparable glory and excel|lency of Christianity. This wisdome of the flesh serves the worldling (like the Ostrich wings) to make him to out&punc; run others upon the earth and in earthly things; but can helpe him never a whit to|wards heaven: nay, is rather like a heavy mill|stone about his necke, to make him sinke deeper into the bottomlesse pit of hell.</P>
<P>The reason why these great politicians and jol|ly wise men of the world (as they are called) for all their depths and devices, with all their wit and windings, cannot understand one tittle of the things of GOD, is, because this spirituall know|ledge is hid from them, for so saith our Saviour CHRIST, <HI>Mat.</HI> 11. 25. <HI>I give thee thankes O Father,</HI> LORD <HI>of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and men of understanding, and hast revealed them unto babes.</HI> And this reason our Saviour rendreth why he spake to world|lings
<PB N="211" REF="135">
in parables, and to his Disciples plainely, <HI>be|cause to these it was given to know the secrets of the kingdome of heaven, but to them it was not given.</HI> And indeed it is just with GOD, that,</P>
<P>1. Sith they (when the glorious sun of the Word of life shines surely upon their faces, do wilfully shut their eyes against it, that He should strike them starke blind, so that for matters of sal|vation they should grope even at noone-day, as the blind gropeth in darknesse, and stumbleth in the darkest night.</P>
<P>2. Sith they depend on their owne policy, depths, and turning devices, GOD justly turnes them loose to follow the swing of their carnall reason; and suffers them to lie and delight them|selves in the sensualmists, and self-conceipted foo|leries and vanities of their own naturall wisdome: while the Moone lookes directly upon the Sun, from whom she borrowes her light, she is bright and beautifull, but if she once turne aside, and be left to her selfe, she loses all her glory, and enjoyes but onely a shadow of light which is her owne: so while men with humility and teachablenesse turne their faces toward the Sun of righteousnesse, CHRIST IESVS, and those Starres which he holds in his right hand, the faithfull Ministers, to receive from them illumination in heavenly things, and instruction in the wayes of GOD, GOD doth graciously vouchsafe unto them the glorious light of saving knowledge: but when they turne their backs upon Him, betake themselves to their owne plots and projects, devices and policies, and
<PB N="212" REF="136">
seeke deepe to hide their counsell from the LORD: then they are justly left to the darksome giddinesse of their carnall reason, and walke towards feare|fulnesse and horrour, thorough the windings and turnings of their worldly wisdome.</P>
<P>3. Because they are proud of their earthly poli|cy, the LORD will not give them prudence in hea|venly matters: because they are wise in their own conceipts, they are justly given over to follow the deceitfulnesse of their owne hearts: with an im|perious disdainfulnesse, they scorne the sim|plicity of the Saints, and therefore they are just|ly blinded, to thinke the wayes of their salvation foolishnesse.</P>
<P>4. Worldly men make an Idoll of their wis|dome: both in respect that they wholly repose themselves upon it, for their provision and prote|ction, and because they secretly desire to be admi|red and adored for it, as men of extraordinary en|dowments, and oracles of discretion and policy: and it may be, that they are so by their favourites and flatterers: but they must give GOD His Word, and good men leave to censure them truly and justly to be the notoriousest fooles upon earth, because they are infants and ideots in the matters and mysteries of salvation. Now I say, because they make an idoll of their wisdome, GOD and this earthly Dagon cannot possibly dwell together in one soule, but in his just judge|ment suffers them with such doting devotion, self|conceipt to sacrifice unto it, that they want both understanding and hearts to do him any accepta|ble service.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="136">This naturall and sensuall wisdome being thus hoodwinked from al heavenly light by GODs just judgement, and by the pride, prejudice, wilful|nesse, selfenesse of the owner doth proportion and measure all its conceipts and considerations of Re|ligion and religious men by the unsound and sen|suall principles of our corrupt nature, and by the false scantling of carnall reason.</P>

<P>Hence it is also that we find it to be a constant property of a worldly-wise man to conceive or censure a zealous profession of GODs truth, and sound practice of sincerity, to be nothing but hy|pocrisie and humour: an affectation of singulari|tie, precisenesse, and a kind of odnesse from other men. The reason is, when he lookes upon him|selfe in the flattering glasse of selfe-conceipt, he judges himselfe to be a very jolly fellow: thinkes he within his owne heart; I go for a sufficient man in the world: the best make good account of me:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quis&abque; in a|lio supersluum esse censet, ip|se quod non h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">bet, nec cu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">at: <HI>That which he hath not himselfe, or doth not esteeme, he accounts su|perfluity, an idle quality, a meere foppery or hypo|crisie in another.</HI></NOTE> I am well beloved of my neighbours: my suffici|ency for wisdome, moderation in Religion, civi|lity for cariage, justnesse in dealings with men, are both knowne, and well spoke of by the most: and what would you have more in a man?

And almost ever in a constant opposition to the good way, the power of godlinesse, and strictnesse of the Saints, who are the ordinary objects of their greatest distast, je|sting and scorne: and whereas they (of all others) have best meanes, largest maintenance, most time, capacity, and pregnancy of wit, and other encou|raging advantages whereby they might become excellent schollers, of eminent abilities, proporti|onable to their precedency in birth: yet for want of a conscionable care in their education, of choice

And therefore least he should waxe weary of his way to hell, he failes not by a secret accursed influ|ence to fill his sinfull heart, with an unquenchable thirst after pleasures of the earth. And he doth not onely put this insatiable thirst into the soule of a carnall man; but also by his jugling and art of im|posture, he gilds over sensuall objects, with lying glory, and a deceitfull lustre, and puts a violent, strong inticing power into wordly vanities, that they may continually feed his greedy appetite with fresh succession, and an endlesse variety of sen|suall sweetnesses. Satan himselfe is infinite in ma|lice against the majesty of GOD. Hee drinkes up sinne, and devoures iniquity with as insatiable greedinesse, as Behemoth the river <HI>Iordan.</HI> Of all those huge mountaines, the numberlesse number, and purple seas of sinnes and transgressions, which have at any time, any where, by any creature been committed since himself first fell from heaven unto this hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e, or shall be from thence untill the day of doome, or from thence everlastingly in hell, by bannings, cursings and despaires amongst those damned fiends: I say, of all these sinnes Satan is guilty one way or other: and if he might have his will, he hath malice enough to make an infinite addition both in number and hainousnesse. Where one sinne is committed, he wisheth there were ten thousand. Hee would have every sinfull thought be a sin of Sodomy: every idle word a desperate blasphemy: every angry looke, a bloody murther: every frailty, a crying sinne: every default, a dam|nable rebellion. Now as Satan himselfe is thus in|finite
<PB N="227" REF="143">
and insatiable in the waies of darknesse; so doth hee inspire every limbe of his with a spice of this sinfull greedinesse, and restlesse pursuit of their owne wicked waies. To give an instance of trem|bling and terrour in this kind, and of Satans merci|lesse malice that way. I knew a man which in his life time was given to that fearefull blasphemous sinne of swearing, who comming to his death|bed, Satan so fild his heart with a madded and en|raged greedinesse after that, most gainelesse and pleasurelesse sinne) that though himselfe swore as fast and furiously as he could; yet (as though hee had beene already amongst the bannings and blas|phemies of hell) he desperatly desir'd the standers|by to helpe him with oathes, and to sweare for him. Incredible rage, prodigious fury! Now if Satan be able to beget such insatiablenesse after sin wherein there is no profit or delight at all; how fiercely &amp; fearefully will he enrage carnall men in the pursuit of gainfull, pleasure full and advancing sinnes?</P>
<P>You see then how the insatiablenesse of corrupt affection springs out of the fountaine of originall naughtinesse, from the just curse of GOD and ma|lice of Satan.</P>
<P>It is cleare and evident by ordinary experience, and observation in the world, with what insatisfi|able desire and greedinesse, corrupt affection doth feed upo~ that sensuall object, and earthly pleasure, upon which with speciall apprehension, and delightfull taste, it seazes and sets it selfe.</P>
<P>1. If it fall in love with honour and high

roomes; it begets ambition, which is an unsatia|ble thirst after glory, and a gluttonous excessive desire after greatnesse. Of all other vicious passi|ons which doe possesse the heart of man, it is the most powerfull and unconquerable. As it is su|perlative and transcendent in it object and aspira|tions; and seated in the highest, and haughtiest spi|rits; so is it resolute and desperate in it undertakings furious and head-strong in it pursuits and persecu|tions. It is ventrous to remove any let, and hard|ned for all meanes; many times without remorse or teares, it takes out of the way by some cruell contriuance, their dearest friends, and tramples the neerest blood, as we see ordinarily in the Tur|kish Emperours, to get up into an high place, and grasp an Imperiall Crowne. It is victorious over all other affections, and maisters even the sensua|lity of lustfull pleasures, as we may see in many great men of the Heathens, <HI>Alexander, Scipio, Pom|pey,</HI> and many others; who being tempted with the exquisitenes and varieties of choisest beauties, yet forbare that villanie, not for conscience sake, or for feare of GOD, whome they knew not; but least thereby they should stop the current of their uictorious atchieuements, and obscure the glory of their remarkable valour. It preferres a high roome in the world before a temporall life; yea, and eternall life too. How many great mens hearts have burst, at the displeased and frouning counte|nance of a King? how many either by desperate practices or their own violent hands have brought themselves to untimely ends, because they were
<PB N="229" REF="144">
impatient of the lower places they had formerly enjoyed. <HI>Achitophel,</HI> when hee was like to loose the reputation and ranke of a Privy Councellour, sadled his Asse, went home, put his house in or|der, and hanged himselfe. How many daily runne great hazards, to domineere for a while in their undeserved dignities? And prepare against the day of wrath, by an unconscionable purchasing of highest roomes amongst the sonnes of men?</P>
<P>Lastly, it is uncapable of society, and sharpned by the enjoyment of that it desireth. Give roome to <HI>Caesar,</HI> and heele ambitiously pursue the Sove|raignty of the whole world: Let <HI>Alexander</HI> con|quer the whole world, heele aske for moe; let those be subdued; he would climbe towards the starres, if he could aspire thither, he would peep beyond y^e heavens.

<P>2. If corrupt affection fall in love with riches, and the wedge of gold, it begets covetousnesse, the vilest and basest of all the infection of the soule: as ambition haunteth the haughtiest spirits, so co|vetousnesse lodgeth in the most dunghill disposi|tion, it turnes the soule of man, that noble and im|mortall spirit into earth and mud: whereas it might live in heaven upon earth, and by holy me|ditation, by a sweet familiarity and acquaintance (as it were) with GOD, and conversing above, and in that everlasting heaven of endlesse happinesse hereafter: It lies in hell upon earth, and by rest|lesse torture of unsatiable greedinesse, makes way by it rooting to descend into the hell of wicked de|vils in the world to come. This devouring gan|grene of greedinesse to get riches, doth not onely by a most incompatible antipathy, keepe out grace and GODS feare; but also by it venomous heat wast and consume all honest and naturall affection, both to man, and beasts, to parents, kindred, friends and acquaintance. Nay, it makes a man contemne himselfe body and soule, wilfully to a|bandon both the comfortable enjoyment of this short time of this present mortality, and all hope of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> length of that blessed eternity to come, for a lit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">le transitory pelfe, which he doth neither enjoy or use; except it be for use which enlargeth his co|vetous thirst as mightily, as it brings forth money monstrously.</P>
<P>Besides, covetousnesse pierceth thorow the soule with a thousand torments, and the riches of
<PB N="231" REF="146">
iniquity ingender in the heart of man many tor|tures, envies and molestations, as their proper thunderbolt and blasting. And of all other vile affections it is most sottishly and senslesly unsatia|ble, <HI>Eccles.</HI> 4. 8. For, how is it possible that earth should feed or fill the immateriall and heaven|borne spirit of a man? It cannot be: and the Spi|rit of GOD hath said it shall not be; <HI>Eccles.</HI> 5. 9. <HI>He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver,</HI> &amp;c. Hence it is, that the deeplier the drowsie heart of this covetous man doth drinke of this golden streame, the more furiously it is inflam'd with spirituall thirst. Nay, it is most certaine, that if the covetous man could purchase a monopoly of all the wealth in the world; were he able to empty the Westerne parts of gold and silver; and the East of pearles and jewels; should he enclose the whole face of the earth from one end of heaven to the other; and heape his hoards unto the starres: yet his heart would be as hungry after more riches, as if he had never a penny, and much more: Such is GODS curse upon that man which makes his gold his god. And this insatiablenesse in the cove|tous man begets cruelty and oppression of others, and perpetual want of contentment and comfort in that he hath already. Sweetnes of gaine makes him many times drinke the bloud &amp; eat the flesh of the oppressed. He begins first (if he be of power and place) to grind the faces of the poore; then to pluck of their skins, then to tear their flesh, then to break their bones, and chop them in peeces as flesh for the pot, and at last even to eat the flesh of GODS
<PB N="232" REF="147">
people. That is; first to weary them out with petty wrongs and extraordinary occasions, to vexe them with new conditions, and unconscionable encroachments: and at last to wring their pensive soules from their wasted and hunger-starv'd bo|dies, with extremity of oppression, and cruelty of covetousnesse. And that which is a just curse up|on the covetous man; he is ever infinitely more tormented with the want of that which he doth immoderately and unnecessarily desire, than con|tented and comforted with the enjoyment of those things he doth presently possesse. The ambitious man, if he be disgrac'd and over-top'd by any grand opposite and counterfactionist, or derided and revil'd with baser and inferiour contempt, or neglected by omission of some due observance and ceremony of state: he (I say) is more griev'd, if he want grace, for some such little default in the attributions of his place, and want of complemen|tall respect in that measure, and of such men as he desires; than he hath glory and pompe in his high|est place. This is cleare in <HI>Haman;</HI> though he was compassed and crown'd with such undeserved and extraordinary precedency and pompe; yet this one little thing, because <HI>Mordecai</HI> would not bow the knee and do reverence to him at the Kings gate, did utterly marre and dissweeten all the other excellencies of his new advancement, and extraordinarinesse of the Kings favour: See <HI>Hester</HI> 5. 10, 11, 12, 13. <HI>And Haman told his wife and friends of all his glory,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>But all this</HI> (saith he) <HI>doth nothing availe me as long as I see Mordecai the</HI>
<PB N="233" REF="147">
<HI>Iew sitting at the Kings gate.</HI> As it is thus in ambiti|on, and in great men that are gracelesse; they ma|ny times take more to heart (out of the pride of their hearts) the want of some one circumstantiall observance, and of reverence from some one man; than they heartily enjoy all the other glory of their place: so it is also with the covetous man; though already he hath more than enough; yet some greedy wish of a new addition doth more torture his heart, than the rowing amongst al his o|ther wealth can rejoyce it. <HI>Ahab,</HI> though he had al|ready<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 King. 21. 4.</NOTE> in his hand the riches, glory, pleasures, &amp; so|veraignty of a kingdome, yet after he had cast his covetous eye upon poor <HI>Naboths</HI> vinyard w^c^h was near his palace, his heart did more afflict and vex it self with greedy longing for that bit of earth; than the vast and spacious compasse of a kingdome could counter-comfort. He could take no joy in the beauty of a crowne, and largenesse of his roy|all command, because his poore neighbour would not deprive himselfe and all his posterity of the in|heritance of his fathers, which his ancestors had enjoyed time out of mind.</P>
<P>For a counterpoyson against the greedy gan|grene of hoarding up riches; consider in what stead thy riches will stand thee upon thy bed of death; consider that speech of a poore distressed woman afflicted in conscience, whom I heard thus say in the agony of her grieved spirit, I have husband, goods, and children, and other com|forts; I would give them all the treasures of the earth if I had them, and all the good I shall have in

<P>If corrupt affections fall in love with worldly pleasure, such as are surfeiting and drunkennesse, chambering and wantonnesse, lust and unclean|nesse, unlawfull sports and recreations, it begets a strange furious thirst and heat in the carnall appe|tite, which cannot be satisfied, but like the two daughters of the horsleech, which cry still, give, give; which is set on fire by hell: and therefore it is as unsatiable as that bottomlesse infernall pit; every taste of sensuality serves as fewell to increase the flame and fury of concupiscence: We see it in drunkards, who by drinking do not quench their thirst, and satisfie their appetite, but by their immoderate swilling both increase the burning thirst of their bodies and inraged intemperance of their minds. We heare it of wantons, <HI>Wisd.</HI> 2. <HI>Come let us enjoy the pleasures that are present,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Let us crowne our selves with roses before they wither, let there be no pleasant meadow which our luxurious|nesse doth not passe over; let us leave some token of our pleasure in every place, for that is our portion, and this is our lot.</HI> Every Carnalist feeles it in himselfe after once he hath given the reins to his concupiscence: he is like a strong man running headlong downe a steepe hill, though he would never so faine, he cannot stay himselfe, but run still faster and faster,
<PB N="235" REF="148">
till he breake his neck at the bottome: If once he suffers the fountaine of originall pollution which naturally flowes out of his rocky heart, to have that free and full course: it will shortly gather in its passage many strong and heady streames of stub bornenesse and rebellion, untill by growing by little and little in strength and swiftnesse, it swell into a mighty and furious torrent, so at last fall with fearefull noyse and horrour into the gulfe of irrecoverable misery. In a word, after the heart of a man be set upon any sensuall delight, it feeds upon it as greedily as the horsleech upon corrupt bloud, it will burst before it give over. It will by no meanes part with its hold untill it ei|ther be broken with the hammer of the Word, or burst with the horrour of despaire. It drinkes so deepe and long of the empoysoned cup of carnall pleasures, untill the LORD fill it unto its brim, full of the cup of wine of his indignation, and bid it drinke, be drunken, and spue, and fall, and rise no more, <HI>Ier.</HI> 25. 27.</P>

<P>4. If it fall in love with revenge, it begets a base, a cruell and wolvish disposition, and an unnaturall thirst of bloud: of all the sinfull passions of the soule, desire of revenge is the most base and cow|ardly: it ever breeds in the most hatefull and weakest minds. And of all kind of revenge, that
<PB N="236" REF="149">
is most execrable and deadly, which (like a serpent in the greene grasse) lies lurking in the flatteries and fawnings of a s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">iring face; which kisses with <HI>Iudas,</HI> and kils with <HI>Ioab;</HI> entertaines a man with outward formes, and complement, and cur|tesie, but would (if it durst or might) strike about the third rib, that he should never rise againe: When a mans words are to his neighbour as soft as oyle and butter, but his thoughts towards him composed all of bloud and bitternesse, of gall and gun-powder: for we commonly see, that the ba|sest and most worthlesse men are most malicious and revengefull: seldome doth it find harbour in a well-bred and generous spirit: but as thunder, and tempests, and other fearefull motions in the aire do trouble onely and disquiet those weaker fraile bodies below, but never disturbe or dismay those glorious heavenly ones above: so wrongs, disgraces, and wrongfull usages doe vexe and distemper men of baser temper and conditions: but the causelesse spite and prophane indiscretions and childish brawles of fooles, wound not great and high minds. Above all others, the true Christian which is onely of a true noble spirit, contemnes, scornes, and disdaines to be revenged upon any, though his undeservedly basest and greatest enemy: For,</P>
<P>1. He is completely fortified with the armour of proofe of his owne innocency against the ma|lice and mischiefe of wicked men, and comfort|ed continually with that inward spirituall feast of a good conscience, against all the lies and
<PB N="237" REF="149">
slanders of lewd and spitefull tongues.</P>
<P>2. He leaves them to be scourged of their owne consciences for their causlesse ill-wils a|gainst him, and wrongfull dealings: then which, (except they repent and be reconciled) there is no more certaine and severe revenger and executi|oner: no scourges, no scorpions can so lash and torture a man, as his owne foule and guilty conscience.</P>
<P>3. He is kept in awe by an holy feare from pre|suming to take vengeance out of GODS hands: It is one of GODS royall prerogatives, we must not meddle with that, or incroach upon it, <HI>Venge|ance is mine, I will repay it, saith the</HI> LORD, <HI>Rom.</HI> 12. 19.</P>
<P>4. He will not pollute so farre, and defile the glory and noblenesse of his Christian resolution, as to be mov'd and disquieted with the rage of any dogged <HI>Doeg</HI> or railing <HI>Shimei,</HI> by procuring tem|porall punishments to the spirituall afflictions: and outward vexations to the inward wofull misery of the soule of his prophane malicious opposite: ex|cept he see it probable, that by suffering justice to have its course, the party may be humbled, and o|thers terrified.</P>
<P>5. He knowes out of his Christian policy, that a couragious and undaunted insensibility in suffer|ing injuries, is the way to tame and stop the rage and fury of the wrongers, and to make them to returne and rebound wholly like heavy blowes upon their owne pates. For, a prophane malicious man cannot be possibly more vext, than to see
<PB N="238" REF="150">
himselfe direct particularly his hate and contempt against his supposed adversary a good Christian, and yet he is able to beare it away without wound or passion; nay with reputation and com|fort.</P>
<P>As revenge is base, so it is bloudy and un|quenchable, and prodigiously thirsty that way: I will give instance in the most revengefull wretch (I am perswaded) that ever lived: It is reported of a man, or rather a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Bodin. de Rep. lib.</HI> 5. <HI>cap.</HI> 6.</NOTE> monster of <HI>Millaine</HI> in <HI>Italy;</HI> when he had surprised upon the sudden one whom he deadlily hated, he presently overthrew him, and setting his dagger on his breast, told him, he would presently have his bloud, except he would renounce, abjure, forsweare, and blaspheme the GOD of heaven; which, when that fearefull man (too sinfully greedy of a miserable life) had done; in a most horrible manner he imme|diately dispatch'd him, as soone as those prodigi|ous blasphemies were out of his mouth: and with a bloudy triumph insulting over his mur|dered adversarie, as though his heart had beene possest of all the malice of hell, he added this horrible speech: <HI>Oh</HI> (saith he) <HI>this is a right noble and heroicall revenge, which doth not onely deprive the body of temporall life, but bring also the immortall soule to endlesse flames ever|lastingly.</HI></P>
<P>3. <HI>Desperate:</HI> corrupt affection is strangely despe|rate to run headlong upon the damnation of hell, for a little earthly delight: if we should see a na|ked man in some furious moode, as prodigall of

his temporall life, runne upon his owne sword, or throw himselfe from some steep rocke, or cast himselfe into some deep river, and teare out his owne bowels, we should censure it presently to be a very desperate part and ruefull spectacle: what shall we say of him then, who thorough the fury of his rebellious nature, to the endlesse destructi|on of the life of his immortall soule, doth despe|ratly throw himselfe upon the devouring edge of GODS fiercest indignation: upon the sharpest points of all the plagues and curses in his Booke, and into the very flames of everlasting fire: It is a very fearefull thing, to see a man bath and em|brue his hands in the blood and butchery of his owne body, and with his murderous blade to take away the life thereof: but of how much more hor|rour and wofulnesse is that spectacle, when a des|perate wretch with the empoysoned edge of his owne enraged corruption, doth cut the throat of his owne deare immortall soule, so that a man may teach him all his life long, by the blood thereof in the sinfull passages of his life, untill at length it bee stark dead in sinnes and trespasses, for how can a soule all purple red with willfull sheading its own blood, looke for any part in that pretious blood of that spotles lambe? Nay, assuredly such bloody stubbornnes and selfe-murthering cruelty will be paid home at last, by the severe revenger of such cursed desperatnesse. Hee will judge such a man after the manner of them that shed their owne blood, and give him the blood of wrath and of jea|lousie.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="151">Lord it is prodigiously strange and lamentably fearefull, that so noble and excellent a creature as man, prince of all other earthly creatures, by the priviledge of reason and enlightned with the glo|rious beame of understanding, nature should be so furiously madded with its owne malice, and be|witchedly blindfolded by the Prince which rules in the Aire; as, for the momentany enjoyment of some fewglorious miseries, bitter-sweet pleasures, heart-vexing riches, or some other worldly vanity at the best, desperatly and wilfully to abandon and cast himselfe from the unconceivable pleasures of its joyfull place where GOD dwels, into an infinite world of everlasting woefulnesse. For let a carnall man consider in a word his prodigious madnesse in this point. He might not onely in this vale of teares bee possest with a peacefull heart, which is an incomparable pretiousnesse surpassing all cre|ated understandings: For I dare say this, I know it to bee true: One little glimpse of Heaven shed sometimes into the heart of a sanctified man, by the saving illumination of the comforting spirit, whereby he sees and feeles, that in despight of the rage of divels, &amp; malice of men; let sin and death, the grave and hell doe their worst, his soule is most certainely bound by the hand of GOD in the bundle of the living, and that hee shall hereafter e|verlastingly inhabite the joyes of eternity: I say this one conceit being the immediate certificate of the spirit of truth doth infinitely more refresh his affections, and affect his heart with more true sweetnesse and tastfull pleasure, then all carnall de|lights,

<P>If carnall wretches be so desperate, as wilfully to spill the bloud of their owne soules: let us set light by the life of our bodies, if the cruelty of the times call for it, for the honour of the Saviour of our soules.</P>
<P>Let me give one instance of dangerous snares, wherein such as these are ordinarily entangled and holden fast, from which inferiours are for the most part free. Let us come into a towne or countrey&punc;village, and we shall find all the rest not so exorbitant but enter into the Noblemans, Gen|tlemans, or Knights house, (if there be any there) there shall we find a nest of new-fangl'd fashio|nists; naked breasts, and naked armes, like bed|lams, saith that excellent and learned Gentleman, in his <HI>Oyle of Scorpions.</HI> Bushes of vanity in the one<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 109.</NOTE> sexe, which they will not part with (said <HI>Marbury</HI>) untill the Devill put a candle into the bush: and cut haire in the other, stirs against the Ordinance of GOD, and nature in both: and many other such deformed lothsome, and prodigious fashions, censured by that stinging and flaming place against fashion-mongers, <HI>Zeph.</HI> 1. 8.

than to draw such as delight in, and dote upon these miserable fooleries, from the abhorred vani|ty of strange fashions: nay, and though somtimes they would be thought to looke towards reli|gion.</P>
<P>And thus I have done with the reasons peculiar to every severall sort of greatnesse: I now come to those which are common to them all.</P>
<P>1. All the great ones according to the flesh in any of these kinds: I say, ye are all as yet deadly<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal 24. 4.</NOTE> enemies from the very heart-root to the professi|on<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 5. 8.</NOTE> and practice of the holy men, without which<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">. 14&punc;</NOTE> holinesse we cannot see GOD: you cannot endure to be called puritans; much lesse to become such: and yet without purity, none shall ever see the face of GOD with comfort.</P>
<P>Mistake me not.

<P>Secondly, I meane onely such as <HI>Bellarmine</HI> in|timates, when he cals King IAMES puritan: for, he so cals him, saith D. <HI>Harkwit</HI> against <HI>Carrier,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">. pag. 258.</NOTE> because in the first booke of his <HI>Basilicon Doron,</HI> he affirmes, that the religion professed in <HI>Scotland</HI> was grounded upon the plaine words of the Scripture: And againe in his second Booke, that the reforma|tion of religion in <HI>Scotland</HI> was extraordinarily wrought by GOD.

And if a man speake but holily, and name but reformation, Scripture, conscience, and such other words which sting their carnall

<P>Thirdly, I meane the very same, of whom Bi|shop <HI>Downam</HI> one of the greatest schollers of ei|ther Kingdome, speakes thus in his Sermon at Spittle, called <HI>Abrahams Triall: And even in</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 7<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">&punc;</NOTE> <HI>these times</HI> (saith he) <HI>the godly live amongst such a ge|neration of men, as that if a man do but labour to keepe a good conscience in any measure, although he meddle not with matters of State, or Discipline, or Ceremonies, (as for example, if a Minister diligently preach, or in his preaching seeke to profit rather than to please, re|membring the saying of the Apostle&punc;</HI> If I seeke to please men, I am not the servant of CHRIST, Gal. 1. 10. <HI>Or if a private Christian make conscience of swearing, sanctifying the Sabbath, frequenting Ser|mons, or absteining from the common corruptions of the time) he shall straightway be condemned for a Puritan, and consequently be lesse favoured than either a carnall Gospeller, or a close Papist,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Fourthly, I meane none but those whom the Communion-Booke intends in that passage of the prayer after confession: <HI>That the rest of our life hereafter may be pure and holy.</HI></P>

The Word must first illighten, convince, and cast them downe: so that out of sight of sinne, and sense of divine wrath, being wea|ry, sicke, lost, wounded, bruised, broken-hearted, (these are Scripture-phrases) and thereupon cast|ing their eyes upon the amiablenesse, excellency,

They put on with the hand of faith the per|fect purity of His imputed righteousnesse, attend|ed ever with some measure of inherent purity, infu|sed by the sanctifying Spirit, and after entring the good way, their lives are ever after pure and holy. These are CHRISTS <GAP DESC="foreign">, and the Puritans I meane. And these men of purity some never meane to be: nay, they heartily hate the very i|mage of IESVS CHRIST in them, they speake spitefully against them, <HI>David</HI> was not onely the drunkards song, but those also that sate in the gate spoke against him: they are your <HI>musicke,</HI> and matter of your mirth; <HI>I am your musicke,</HI> saith the Church in the person of <HI>Ieremie, Lam.</HI> 3. They will many times call upon a roguish vagabond at your feasts to sing a song against them, whom they should rather set in the stockes; they are trans|ported, and inwardly boyle with farre more indig|nation and heart-rising against their holinesse, pu|rity, precise walking, and all meanes that lead thereunto, though enjoyned upon paine of never seeing the face of GOD in glory: than more<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb 12. 14.</NOTE> simple, poorer, and meaner men; and that's a rea|son<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 24. 4.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat 5. 8.</NOTE> they sticke faster in the Devils clutches than<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 3. 3.</NOTE> they, and that few of them are called, con|verted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 5. 15.</NOTE>

<P>Secondly, ye that are thus the worlds favou|rites, are very loth to become fooles; and there|fore in the meane time he lockt full fast in the De|vils bands, and cannot escape except ye be such. I speake a very displeasing thing to worldly-wise men, but they are the very words and wisdome of the Spirit of GOD, 1 <HI>Cor. 3. 18. Let no man deceive himselfe: if any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a foole, that he may be wise.</HI></P>
<P>Let no man deceive himselfe; such caveats as this are wont to be premised when men out of their carnall conceipts are peremptory to the con|trary, and would venture their salvation (as they say) that it is not so. See <HI>Ephes. 5. 6. 1 Cor. 6. 9. Mat.</HI> 5. 2. And did not most of your hearts rise a|gainst these words of mine (you must become fooles, or never be saved) untill I brought Scripture? Give me here leave (I pray you) to in|timate in a few instances the meaning of the place, and the truth of your false and selfe-couzening hearts in obnoxiousnesse to the point. Suppose a messenger of GOD should deale faithfully with you, and tell you, that upon the LORDS Day you must not serve yourselves, and your owne turnes, in idlenesse, travailing, sports, gaming: in any earthly businesse, or mis-imployment whatsoever: but spend that whole blessed Day wholly and one|ly in spirituall refreshing, heavenly businesses, di|vine worship, and holy duties: in meditation up|on the creatures spiritually, upon the great worke

of redemption and resurrection of CHRIST: and upon that everlasting rest above: of all which the Christian Sabbath is a remembrancer unto us, in both publike and private prayer, reading, sing|ing of Psalmes, hearing Sermons, conference, &amp;c. and in ruminating, and (as it were) chewing the cud upon Scripture points. I say, <HI>ruminate (as it were) and chew the cud:</HI> for, it is the very phrase of the Church of <HI>England</HI> in the <HI>Homily for reading Scriptures.</HI> And those reverend and godly men which composed them, expresse the benefit thereof emphatically: Thus run the words; <HI>Let us ruminate</HI> of the Scriptures sc.) <HI>that we may have the sweet juyce, spirituall effect, marrow, honey, kernell, taste, comfort, and consolation of them.</HI> I say, suppose ye were thus prest, would ye not presently out of your worldly wisdome and impatiency to be so snaff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">d at, to be tied all the day to spirituall exerci|ses, and restrain'd from ordinary recreations, con|ceive of it, and cry out against it as a puritanicall novelty, and foolish precisenesse? Because you mention precisenesse and novelty; I could (as I am wont, and to make you without excuse) appeale unto, and implore the aid of antiquity, which will utterly take off such aspersions. And here (were it incident and seasonable) I were able to procure Councels, and Fathers, and other authorities con|currently to testifie and take my part, that upon the LORDS Day, <HI>we are to recreate our selves onely with spirituall delights:</HI> onely then to ply divine businesses, and to do those things alone which be|long to our soules salvation.

<P>Nay the whole Church of <HI>England</HI> hath this threescore yeares and above complyed exactly with antiquity in this point in the <HI>Hom. of the place and time of prayer:</HI> These are the words, GODS <HI>people should use the Sunday holily, and rest from their common and daily businesse: and also give them|selves wholly to heavenly exercises of</HI> GODS <HI>true religion and service.</HI> And yet for all this, you are so wise in your owne conceipts; ye will none of this saving folly, you are no such fooles, as after so long liberty to fall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">o any such strictnesse.</P>
<P>Secondly, suppose a Minister should counsell you when you come home from the house of GOD, to take your Bibles, and call both your wives and children to the comparing together, and conferring upon those things which were taught: That the husband should exact of the wife, and the wife aske of the husband those things that were there spoken and read, or at least some of them: That you should set this law to your selves to be kept inviolably, and not onely to your selves, but also to your wives and children: that you would spend that one whole Day of the whole weeke, whereon you meet to heare the Word, in medita|tion
<PB N="250" REF="156">
of those things which are delivered: I say now in this case your carnall wisedome would re|solutely condemne such counsells, as contrary to the counsell of great houses, as a way to become a By-word to the whole Country, and as savoring too rankly of a foolish strictnesse, and needlesse singularity. And yet this was <HI>totidem verbis,</HI> wise, holy advise above twelve hundred yeares agoe: For it giving the counsell, I have but rendred <HI>Chrysostome</HI> word for word in diverse places. <HI>Hom. 5. in Matth. In Eph. Serm. 20. Hom. 2. in Ioan. Hom. 5. ad Popul. Antioch.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, If Preachers should presse you to plant, and preserve Family Duties in your house, Prayer, and reading Scriptures, evening, and mor|ning, Singing of Psalmes, &amp;c. and you of greatest meanes may best spare time for such blessed busi|nesses. Would not your wisedomes thinke this more then need: And that it would bee a foolish thing, and much against your profit, to rob your selves, and servants of so much time from your worldly affaires? And yet here I could produce foure or five Fathers above a thousand yeares ago, pressing this point, and punctuall for my purpose.

<P>Thus might I passe through all the points of Sanctification, and passages of holy life: And all the great men of the world, either in Learning, Wealth, Nobility, or Wisedome <HI>according to the flesh,</HI> would passe these censures upon them, and entertaine conceits of them proportionable to that of <HI>Nicodemus</HI> about the New-birth. They will not become fooles in the Apostles sense: And therefore they are soakt, and fast fettered in the gall of bitternesse, and bond of iniquity; and that above ordinary.</P>
<P>Thirdly, All ye great ones of the world in the sense I have said, As yee are very wise in your own conceits, and it may be truly so <HI>according to the flesh,</HI> so you are selfe-conceited, and soule-couseners a|bout your spirituall state. For you thinke all bet|ter then you, too precise, and all worse then you too prophane; and your selves onely to have hap|pily hit upon the golden meane; and pitch upon that well-tempered moderation in Religion, wher|by you may enjoy temporall happinesse here, and eternall hereafter. Sleepe in a whole skin (as they

say) and with a good conscience: Live the life of pleasures, and die the death of the righteous. Whereas to be so conceited, is the very comple|ment and perfection of folly: And the very same attempt as to make two parallel lines to meet. You thinke yee have a reach beyond the Moone: To lie in some sweete sinne, and yet to nourish in your selves some hope of salvation. To have two hea|vens, one in this world, and another in the world to come, which was never heard of: to weare two crownes of joyes: whereas IESVS CHRIST himselfe had the first of thornes. But alas! Belo|ved, if you be saved in this condition, you must have a new Scripture, and there must bee found out another way to heaven, then any of the Saints ever went since the Creation or shall doe to the end of the world. And therefore we may say of you as <HI>Quintilian</HI> some where, of some deluded with an overweening conceit of themselves. <HI>That they might have prooved excellent Schollers if they had not beene so perswaded already:</HI> So if you did not thinke falsly, your selves safe already, you might be saved.

<PB N="254" REF="158">
You like well enough, nay and much approve, and applaud such Sermons as King IAMES censures, in <HI>the reasons of his directions for preaching,</HI> &amp;c. which he there cals a light, affected, and unprofitable kind of preaching, which hath beene of late years (saith he) taken up in Court, University, City, and Countrey,&mdash;whereby the people are filled onely with ayrie nourishment, &amp;c. and I warrant you, not especially hating to be reformed or dis|quieted, for these are not wont to discover your consciences, nor disturbe you in your present courses, they never terrifie you with any fore|thought of the evill day, neither torment you be|fore the time: but now let a man come with the <HI>foolishnesse of preaching,</HI> by which it pleaseth GOD (saith the Apostle) <HI>to save them that believe,</HI> with demonstration of the Spirit, and of power, and come home to the conscience: if he suffer not Sa|tan to revell in the bloud of your soules without resistance, nor see you post furiously towards e|ternall fire, but will tell you that the pit of hell is a little before you: In a word, if he take the right course to convert you, and shew you therefore onely your spirituall misery, that you may be fit|ted for mercy, &amp;c. O such a fellow is a dangerous man, a terrible and intolerable Teacher, able to drive men to distraction, despaire, selfe-destructi|on; he breaths out nothing but damnation, and his searching Sermons are as scorching as the very flames of hel!

when such men preach, (and it may be you enter|taine some intelligence for that purpose to prevent the torture) you will not, you dare not heare them for your hearts, except you cannot decline it for starke shame; or for a time or two to satisfie your curiosities, but as S. <HI>Paul</HI> saith, you become their enemies, because they tell you the truth: to which truth not to have listened in this day of your visita|tion, will herafter (when it is too late) torment you more than ten thousand fiery Scorpions stings, and gnaw upon your consciences with unknowne and everlasting horrour. Alas! Beloved, what meane you?

Preposterous and prodigious incongruity!</P>
<P>If it be thus then, that of all the severall sorts of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vsex.</NOTE> great men mentioned before (by reason that they are beset with such variety of snares, entangled in so many temptations, so much taken up by the world, and for other reasons rendred already) ve|ry few are called, converted and saved, my coun|sell in a word unto all such, is CHRISTS owne word, <HI>Luke</HI> 13. 24. <HI>Strive to enter in at the strait gate,</HI> lay violent hands upon flesh and blond, stran|gle your lusts, contend and <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> wrastle as for the Garland in the Olympian Games, to which the word seemes to allude, become fooles in the

<P>Upon which before I enter, give me leave to give you an account, why at this time I labour ra|ther to work upon your consciences for your per|sonall conversion, than as heretofore to tender un|to you counsels and considerations, for a more conscionable deportment in your severall publike places. When I well weighed with my selfe, the truth of that principle and position in <HI>Hooker, That it is no peculiar conceipt, but a matter of sound conse|quence, that all duties are by so much the better perform|ed, by how much the men are more religious, from whose abilities the same proceed.</HI> And finding by experi|ence of all ages, and most of all in these worst and wofull times, that men of publike imployment and in high places, untill there be infused into their soules by the Spirit of grace an internall superna|turall principle and divine habit to worke by, un|till <HI>aliquid</HI> CHRISTI (as they say) be planted in them by the power of the Ministry, they cannot possibly be universally thorow, and unshaken. Some strong affection, feare, favour, or some thing, will make them flie out and faile in some particular very fowly. Upon extraordinary temptation they will serve the times, and their
<PB N="257" REF="159">
owne turnes: for&punc; alas! as yet their spirits are not stee|led with that heavenly edge, and mighty vigour, as to set to their shoulders against the torrent of the times, and not to be overflowen with it. I say, upon this ground I have advisedly chosen to assay and follow this way at this time: for, if once you turne on the LORDS side in truth, you are won for ever to an in|vincible constancy, and conscionablenesse in an uni|forme, regular and religious discharge of your pub|like duties: and will ever hold fast without partiality, cowardlinesse, or feare of mans face, that brave and no|ble resolution, <HI>Vt fiat justitia, ruat coelum,</HI> let heaven and earth be blundred together with horrible confusi|sion, before I make shipwracke of a good conscience, or be any waies drawne to do basely. Being incorpo|rated into the rock of eternity IESVS CHRIST bles|sed for ever, you will stand (like unmooveable rocks) against the corruptions of the times, and all ungodly oppositions; and never before. For, in the meane time (say Ministers what they will) you will not be moved; but you heare our discourses of a faithfull discharge of your places, as ye would heare a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice; they leave no more impression upon your consciences, than a sweet lesson upon the Lute in the eare, when it is ended; for, then both the vocall and instrumentall sweetnesse dissolve into the aire, and vanish into no|thing: It is too truly so with our Sermons upon your soules.

And tell the Lawyers, that they should not <HI>make hast to be rich,</HI> for so saith <HI>Salomon,</HI> they <HI>shall not be innocent,</HI> nor swallow downe gold too gree|dily, least it turne to grauell, and the gall of asps with|in them; and they be enforced to vomite up the rich|es (as <HI>Iob</HI> speaketh) they have heaped together so hasti|ly, either by remorse and restitution in the meane time, or with despaire, and impenitent horrour here af|ter: that to oppose and wrangle against a good cause, or undertake the defence of a bad; are both equally most unworthy the very morall vertue of an honest Heathen; that they must not learn to spin out the causes of their clients from Terme to Terme, and wire-draw their suits untill they be utterly undone; that they should not now be taking instructions from their cli|ents, when they should themselves here in the House of GOD be instructed to the kingdome of heaven: had they this morning received a message from the Al|mighty, that at night they should appeare before that high and everlasting Iudge to give an account for all things done in the flesh; if they be not Atheists, or Pa|pists, O with what eagernesse and violence would they have attended, addrest, and applied themselves to the present opportunity! and little do we know what the evening may bring forth. For, assure your selves, there is no man so assured of his riches, or life, but that he may be deprived of one or both the very next day or houre to come. And tell the jurors and sworn-men,
<PB N="260" REF="161">
that they should rather die than draw the bloud of any mans life, livelihood, or good name upon their owne consciences, either by acqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ting the guilty, or betray|ing the innocent. Here (had I time) I would intimate unto you a mysticall, but mischievous packing some|times in choice of j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ry-men. I have seene (I speake of that which was long since, and at a Sessions) some of the choicest drunkards in a Country chosen for that service. Now is it not a pitifull thing, that Country businesses should be put into the hands of such as la|bour industriously, and with equall cunning, to plague an honest man, and deliver a drunkard? I say now, all this while, we thus discourse unto you, earnestly en|deavouring, and with a thirsty desire to do you good, and direct you aright, and by a divine rule in the seve|rall duties proper to your places: we do but plow in the sea, and sow in the aire (as they say) except the im|mortall seed of the Word hath first moulded you anew, and ye be brought by the <HI>foolishnesse of preaching</HI> out of the warme sun into GODS blessing, and from the fooles paradise of worldly wisdome, into the holy path of sincere professours; and thereupon prize and preferre the peace of a good conscience before all the gold in the West, and preferments in the world; which blessed change from nature to grace, is wrought by such stirrings of the soule, and footsteps of the spi|rit as these: lend me, I beseech you, (while I passe a|long them) something more than ordinary attention: for, I know they will seeme strange things to all such great ones as are intended in my Text, and those who live at rest in their possessions, and have nothing to vex them. The naturall stoutnesse of their spirits will disdaine and scorne to stoupe to such uncouth humili|ations,
<PB N="261" REF="161">
and this mighty change. And the more they are men of the world, and wise according to the flesh, the greater repugnancy and reluctation shall they find in their affections against these spirituall workings, which makes the point good which was proved be|fore. But yet without them in truth and effect (I de|fine not the measure and degree, GOD is a most free agent) they can never become either gracious men, or good Magistrates. They must upon necessity become such fooles, or they can never be wise unto salvation.</P>
<P>1. If any of you then would come out of Satans clutches into the armes of CHRIST, he must be il|lightened, convinced, and cast downe with sight, sense, and trouble for sinne, as in my art of comforting af|flicted consciences I have shewed.</P>
<P>2. Secondly, the point may teach us not to be gree|dy of greatnesse, nor hunt ambitiously after high roomes.</P>
<P>3. The point may serve as a soveraigne antidote a|gainst all discontent or fretting, when we see men of the world carrie all before them, &amp;c. We may enter|tain an holy indignation to see folly set in great excel|lency, so many servants on horse-backe, and Princes walking as servants upon the ground. But I am pre|vented by the time from prosecuting these two latter Uses. Let me briefly say two things more, and I have done.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The first concerning what I have said: I have spoken much (as you have heard, my Text naturally and directly leading me thereunto) of the true misery, and spirituall madnesse of all great men in learning, wealth, nobility, wisdome according to the flesh. Least any be unjustly angry, and mistake, or caussesly grum|ble

and gainsay, let me take up the words of that anci|ent holy Father <HI>Salvianus</HI> about a thousand yeares a|go in the like case. He having impartially discovered the horrible impieties of the noble and rich men in those corrupt times, tels them by the way, and it is my just apologie at this time. <HI>I do not</HI> (saith he) <HI>speake thus of any, but onely such as know these things to be in them|selves. If their consciences be free, nothing that I say tends to their disparagement and disgrace: but if they know them|selves to be guilty, let them know also, that they are not my words, but their owne consciences which vexe them.</HI> And in another place thus. <HI>Sith I speake not these things of all, but those who are such, none of you ought to be angry at all, which findeth not himselfe to be obnoxious; least thereby he make himselfe seeme, and be suspected to be of the number of those that are naught. Rather let so many as being guiltlesse and truly noble, abhorre such unworthy courses, be angry with them who disgrace the name of Nobility by their base and wicked behaviour: because although others be much worse, and scandaliz'd by them, yet especially they bring a great deale of shame and dishonour upon those who are of the same noble ranke.</HI> Take notice by the way, that by the Fathers words, those men are much too blame, who go about to dawbe over the disorders, and smother up the scandalous exorbitancies of delinquents in their owne profession, or to be concurrents for their delive|rance from deserved shame and punishment. To give instance in the highest calling: A Minister which fals to drunkennesse, and ale-house-haunting, should ra|ther be publikely sham'd and censured, than a fellow of an inferiour calling. We do not honour the Mini|stry by having our hands in helping out such, but by disclaiming, and not owning them; well may we by
<PB N="263" REF="163">
so medling incurre suspicion of obnoxiousnesse: but never bring credit to our so holy a calling. I knew a Knight did penance at <HI>Pauls-Crosse,</HI> but at the same time I heard that many of his ranke in the City la|bour'd to have him dis-knighted first, before he so publikely disgraced their order. Me thinks all well|minded should be so minded.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The other is to my Lords the Iudges. My reve|rend and noble Lords, give me leave to cloth the thoughts of the Countrey in a word or two. We much rejoyce in you, and blesse GOD for you, as men of singular and knowne integrity, speciall friends to the Gospell of IESVS CHRIST, and a great honour, and happinesse to these parts, and heartily pray that we may hold you still: and therefore my intreaty unto your Lordships is, that you would couragiously ad|vance forward, and do like your selves, and nobly still. Draw our your dreadfull swords against the tor|rents of Belial, as <HI>David</HI> cals them, which even threa|ten a deluge; and be your selves as mighty torrents, armed both with j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">st and holy lawes, and the godly resolutions of your owne noble spirits, to beare backe, and beat downe the common crying, and raigning sins of our Countrey. In a word, be unto the oppressed and innocent as a refuge from the storme, but as a ter|rible tempest upon the face of every humane beast, and sonne of Belial. And O that you could helpe us, that GODS people might not perish for want of bread: Is it not a pitifull thing, that in such a deare yeare specially, it should be almost as hard a worke to get downe a wicked ale-house, as to win <HI>Dunkerke?</HI> That Maultsters should snatch (as it were) the graine from the mouthes of the poore in the market place, to
<PB N="264" REF="164">
uphold these hell-houses, these nurceries of the De|vill: that Magistrates should be so unmercifull, as nei|ther for GODS sake, nor the Kings sake, nor the poores sake, nor their owne soules sake to take the ut|most penalties for blasphemies, ale house-hauntings, drunkennesse, and prophanations of the LORDS Day? And were it not an honourable course, and worthy to have an universall contribution over the Countrey to pull downe something the excessive prizes in mar|ket-townes for the poore thereabouts, during this extremity? But I leave it to your Lordships charita|ble wisdome to do the best you can possibly; that the bloud of the poore this yeare be not added to the al|ready crying sinnes of the Kingdome, to hasten GODS judgements upon us, and our long since deser|ved ruine. And in the meane time you need not feare the face of the proudest Devill, whether incarnate, or in his owne shape. For, while you thus advance GODS glory, and truly honour the King, assure your selves, the hearts, and teares, and prayers of all good men shalbe for you, and yours shalbe the crowne and comfort; when all prophanenesse and prophane op|posites to the good way, all the enemies of GOD, and pestilent packings and complotments of the De|vils agents against GODS people, shalbe buried in hell.</ITEM>
