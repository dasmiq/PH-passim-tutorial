Among many other, who wyl not recou~t y^e cu+<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter">to~e of gyuyng newe yeres gyftes to be so commendable and prayse wor|thy, that he maye seme to be estrau~|ged from all ciuilite, that dothe not obserue it vnto the vttermost of his power? For what other thing do we

meane by geuyng mutuall giftes in the begynnyng of a newe yeare, tha~ that we desyre, that all good, lucky, prosperous and fortunate thynges maye chaunse that yere vnto euery one of vs, and that one wylleth, wy|sheth &amp; desyreth well to another, is redy to do good one to another, and to healpe what so euer lyethe in hys power? This vndoubtedly was the meanyng of the~, that fyrst were the inue~tours of this moost honest and frendly custome, &amp; to this ende hath it ben obserued, kept &amp; mayntayned hytherto. Whan I consydered this but lately &amp; iudged y^e custome to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> both good and godly, and nothyn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> more mete for the preseruacion an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> co~ciliacio~ of amite.

Yet I would
<PB REF="3">
prepare somthyng, wherby I might shewe my selfe to wysh well vnto all men, and to beare an honest &amp; frend+ly hart to my co~trey me~ of Englo~d. I haue therfore prouided a newe ye+res gyfte, not of corruptible gold or syluer, but of the moost sacred scrip+tures, whiche,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. xviii</NOTE> as Dauid saythe, are much more worthy to be desired the~ golde or precious stonne, &amp; are swe|ter then the hony &amp; hony combe.</P>
<P>In this my newe yeares gyfte I haue openned many goodly &amp; godly thynges. Amonge all other, I haue declared, what a precious treasure Christ is vnto vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay. ix.</NOTE> whiche was gyue~ vs of God the father for our new ye+res gyfte, and how many benefites we haue receyued by hym. I haue al+so described the whole lyfe of a chri|sten ma~, shewyng what we must do, if we wyll enioy so great benefites. Agen, I haue exhorted men to mor|tify
<PB REF="4">
theyr carnal affectes &amp; worldly lustes, and shewed them howe they must walke both toward the~selues, theyr neyghbour &amp; God, if they wyl haue the fruicion of the celestiall en+heretau~ce. To co~clude, as I haue she+wed that all saluacion commeth by Christ, so haue I proued that Christ is no sauiour but to the~ that repe~t, beleue, lede a vertuous lyfe, &amp; be ple~+teous in doyng good workes. These thinges with diuers other not to be despised shal be fou~d in this my new yeares gyfte, so that I doubte not, but that it shall be no les profitable for the soule, than other worldly gif+tes shall be for the body.</P>
<P>This my labour employed herein after myne so greuous &amp; troublous syckenesses, I dedicate and sende to your ryght worshypfull mastershyp for a newe yeares gyfte, desyrynge you to accepte it wyth no lesse good

<P>GOD the Author of euery yere mought vouchesafe to graunt that this newe yeare wythe many other maye euer begynne vnto you withe good fortune, procede wyth better, ende with that which is best, and alway be fortunate vnto you so long as they last, so y^t ye maye alway enioye co~|tinual helth &amp; pros|pero&abus; felicite ac|cordyng to y^e wyll of God, to whome be all honour &amp; glory. <HI>AMEN.</HI></P>

<P>I besech God, it may so come to passe. Thus haue I accomplysshed youre desyre neyghbours in prouynge by y^e scrip+tures and the auncient Doctors, y^t christ by hys death hath not only re+demed, delyuered and set vs fre fro~ originall synne, but also from all o|ther, and that the synnes, which we commit after baptisme, be not for|gyuen of God the father for the dig+nite and worthynes of ony workes which we do, but for the excelle~cy of y^e sacrifyce, which Christ once for al offered vpon the Altare of y^e crosse, the vertue &amp; strengthe wherof aby|deth in so full power, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is able to saue so many as repent, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">leue. &amp;
<PB REF="83">
labour to lead a good and innocent lyfe for euermore. Neyther haue I spoken theyse thynges to discorage ony man from doyng good workes, but for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o set forth christ to be a per+fecte sauyoure agaynst the wycked doctrine of the Anabaptistes which nowe begyn to crepe in amonge vs vnto the great dishonour of God, y^e extreme blasphemy of Christes most precious bloud, &amp; noysome pertur|bacio~ of the holy catholyke chyrche. And as I maye knytte vp all thys matter in fewe wordes, know good brothers, that in Adam all we were damned, so that thorowe his wicked+nes we were begotten, conceaued &amp; borne in synne, yea &amp; by nature the very sonnes of wrathe.

Therfore God moued w^t pi+tie towarde mankynde, euen of hys owne free mercy &amp; goodnes w^toute ony of our desertes, sent downe his only begotten sonne Iesus christ in to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">his vale of misery which for our sake toke flesh of the moost holy and pure virgin Mary, thorow the ope|racion of the holy ghost, became ma~ &amp; at the tyme to fore appoynted, he offered voluntaryly his moost blys|sed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ody an acceptable &amp; swete smel|lynge Sacrifice to God the father, which was &amp; is of so great vertue &amp; power, that by it alone all our syn|nes are putte awaye, not only that which we committed in Adam, but those also, whiche we oure selues in processe of tyme do perpetrate &amp; co~|mit. Now so many of vs as are bap|tised in the name of the father, of y^e
