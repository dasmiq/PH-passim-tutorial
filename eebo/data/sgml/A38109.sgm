<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE LORDS and COMMONS Assembled in PARLIAMENT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Right Honourable and Noble Senatours,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>_I</HI> Here present you with a Catalogue or Black Bill of the Errours, Heresies, Blasphemies, and Practices of the Sectaries of this time, broached and acted within these four last years in <HI>England,</HI> and that in your Quarters, and in places under your Government and Power, for which I tremble to thinke lest the whole King|dom should be in Gods Black Bill: I much fear lest the subject matter of this Catalogue may prove unto <HI>England</HI> (unlesse some speedy and effectuall course be taken to prevent it) like the Bill of Divorce given to <HI>Israel; Jer. 3.8.</HI> like the Roll of the Book commanded from God to be written by <HI>Jeremi|ah</HI> against <HI>Israel</HI> and <HI>Judah, Jer. 36.2.</HI> like the Roll of a Book sent by a hand to <HI>Ezekiel, Ezek. 2.9, 10.</HI> wherin was written, lamentations, mourning and wo; or like the hand|writing upon the wall against <HI>Belshaz. Dan. 5.5.</HI> &amp; the flying Roll in <HI>Zech. c. 5. v. 1, 2.</HI> a curse going over the face of the whole land. And unto whom, Right Honourable, should I present and make known these things, but unto You, who are the supreme Iudicatory of this Kingdom, having that sufficiency of Power, which only is able to remedy and re|dresse them, who are our great Physician's, and have been wont to cure the worst ma|ladies and diseases of our Church and State, who are by God himself stiled <HI>Gods,</HI> and therefore should above others lay to heart and be sensible of the injuries and disho|nours done to God and his name. And I humbly pray your Honours to beare with me in my addresses this way, as having no other meanes but this, of acquainting You with the sad state of things in our Church: And yet 'tis necessary You should hear of these things, for as 'tis said in the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> concerning the making of that Roll, <HI>It may be the house of Judah will hear all the evill which I purpose to do to them, that they may turne every one from his evill way, it may be they will
<PB REF="3">
present their supplications before the Lord, that he may forgive their iniquity and their sin;</HI> so it may be some good may come of this Book, to cause an humiliation for, and a suppression of heresies and schimes, as being a more free and f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll discovery of our times then ever yet was made, and therefore I send it abroad in this way, whereby it may be read by all <HI>Judah</HI>: and I doubt not but some faithfull <HI>Baruchs,</HI> who are not shut up, but do preach before You on Fast dayes, will cause You to hear the words of this Book in the Lords house, by applying them to your consciences, and making them a Catalogue of sins for matter of humiliation to you on those dayes, showing how far they may become yours in suffering without punishment and cen|sure too many of them. And now, Noble and worthy Senatours, be graciously plea|sed to pardon the boldnesse I shall take in dealing plainly with you in this present Epistle, and not to impute it to any malignity and disaffection to your service, or to peremptory saucinesse, and disrespect of You, (for besides that some worthy Mem|bers of Parliament to whom I am known can testifie the contrary, all my Actions from the beginning of Your sitting, my Sermons, Prayers, Prayses, Discourses, Actings for You speak otherwise: I am one who out of choise and judgement have imbarked my self with Wife, Children, Estate, and all that's dear to me in the same ship with You, to sinke and perish, or to come safe to land with You, and that in the most doubtfull and difficult times, not only early in the first beginning of the war and troubles, in a malignant place among Courtiers, and those who were servants and had relations to the King, Queen and their Children, pleading Your Cause, justifying Your wars, satisfying many that scrupled: but when Your affairs were at lowest, and the chance of war against You, and some of the Grandees and favou|rites of these times were packing up, and ready to be gone, I was then highest and most zealous for You, preaching, praying, stirring up the people to stand for you by going out in person, lending of money, in the later going before them by example; And as I have been your Honours most devoted servant so am I still yours, and you cannot easily lose me; and I do humbly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> self&punc; and Book at the feet of your wisedome and piety submitting both to your ple<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re but to the matter and contents of this Book, and to the present state of things. I am bound and stirred in spirit, to see the people so given to errour and schisme, and the zeal of Gods house and glory constrains me, and I can no longer forbear speaking my whole heart to you. The evills of this kinde are grown to such a height as there is the more time for silence, or for be|ing afraid, but of crying out and speaking plainly. And I am confident when your Honours have read over my Book (which I humbly desire you in the fear of God, and for the glory of Christ to do, as <HI>Luther</HI> bespeaks the reading of an Epistle of his) that will be a just Apologie with you for my freenesse and boldnesse. O the evil of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hese times would put zeal into the heart of any man, who hath any l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve to the glo|ry of God, his truth, and the souls of people, and make the stammering tongue to speak

O cursed be the silence and flattery that is in such a time as this: For now things are grown to a strange passe, (though nothing is now strange,) and every day they grow worse and worse, and you can hardly conceive and imagine them so bad as they are; no kinde of blasphemy, heresie, disorder, confusion, but either is found among us, or a coming in upon us; for we in stead of a Reformation, are grown from one extreme to another, fallen from <HI>Scylla</HI> to <HI>Charibdis,</HI> from Popish Innovations, Superstitions, and Prelaticall Tyranny, to damnable Heresies, horrid Blasphemies, Libertinisme, and fearfull Anarchy; our evils are not removed and cured, but only changed; one disease and Divell hath left us, and another as bad is come in the room; yea, this last extremity in which we are fallen, is far more high, violent and dangerous in many respects; all which in an Epistle cannot be contained, but are laid down in the following Book in many places, specially in the eleventh Corollary. <HI>Luther</HI> in an Epistle to <HI>Spalatinus,</HI> calls want of freedome in a Minister, <HI>irremissible peccatum,</HI> an unpardonable sin; and silence in the neglecting of truth, a wicked silence; and in an Epistle to <HI>Staupitius</HI> saith, <HI>Let me be found any thing, a proud man, an adulte|rer, murderer, and guilty of all wickednesse, so as I be not convicted of wicked silence whilst the Lord suffers.</HI> The consideration of which, makes me well content|ed to run the venture of being accounted proud, saucy, peremptory, and of incurring the hazard of your displeasure by speaking freely (though I hope better things) then to let the glory and honour of Christ and his truth suffer any longer by my silence; for I call the most High GOD to witnesse, that (so far as I know my own heart) what freedome I here use, in laying open the state of things before you, is not out of any sinister respect, or any pleasure I take in this liberty (for I have had ma|ny carnall reasonings and conflicts in my spirit against it) but only out of the great necessity of the times, moved thereunto out of love and zeal to the glory of God and his truth my faithfulnesse to your Honours, compassion to the souls of those for whom Christ dyed, and the delivering of my own soul in the discharge of my con|science.

infirmities, as that cruell fact of his against the inhabitants of <HI>Thessalonica,</HI> as his being angry out of measure against the people of <HI>Antiochia,</HI> as his lenity to|wards Arians, whom he permitted to keep Conventions in chief Cities; but in all his faults this is observed and admired by the Ecclesiasticall Historians who writ of him, that he ever gave place to wholsome admonitions, and amended upon being dealt with, as by <HI>Flavianus</HI> Bishop of <HI>Antiochia, Amphilochius</HI> Bishop of <HI>Iconi|um, Ambrose</HI> Bishop of <HI>Millain;</HI> and he took <HI>Ambroses</HI> liberty of speaking to him so well, that he did not only give him thanks, but said of him to his praise, I have at length found a master of truth, for I have known <HI>Ambrose</HI> only a Bishop wor|thy of that name. It was one of the sins of the Prelates and Court Chaplains (for which among others God hath cast them out) to flatter, and the sin of the Court, that the Ministers that preached there, must sing <HI>placentia,</HI> speak smooth things. Now far be it from such a High Court of Parliament as you, (who above other Parli|aments are in solemne Covenant with God for Reformation, Nationall, Dom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sti|call, Personall, and have professed to engage your hearts for God and his work&punc;) and from the Ministers who stand up for you, and adhere to you, to be faulty in the same kinde: Be pleased therefore in the midst of your many great affairs which even swallow you up, and by reason of which you have not time to hear and know all things concerning the State of Religion, to suffer one of your daily Re|membrancers to God, to be Gods Remembrancer to you. You have, most Noble Senatours, done Worthily against Papists, Prelats and scandalous Ministers, in casting dowe Images, Altars, Crucifixes, throwing out Ceremonies, &amp;c. but what have You done against other kinds of growing evills, Heresie, Schisme, Dis|order, against Seekers, Anabaptists, Antinomians, Brownists, Libertines and other Sects? You have destroyed <HI>Baal</HI> and his Priests; but have you been zealous against golden Calves, and the Priests of the lowest of the people? are not these grown up, and dayly increase under you? are any effectuall meanes used against them? You have made a Reformation, and blessed be God who put it into your hearts to do such things; but with the Reformation have we not a Deformation, and worse things come in upon us then ever we had before? were any of those monsters heard of here|tofore, which are now common among us? as denying the Scriptures, pleading for a Toleration of all Religions and worships, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Book intit. <HI>Toleration Justified,</HI> page, <HI>7.8.</HI> printed in this last <HI>January.</HI></NOTE> yea for blasphemy and denying there is a God. You have put down the Book of Common Prayer: and there are many among us have put down the Scriptures, slighting, yea blaspheming them. You have broken down Images of the Trinity, Christ, Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> Apostles: and we have those who overthrow the Doctrine of the Trinity, oppose the Divinity of Christ, speak evill of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> sleight the Apostles. You have cast out the Bishops and their Officers: and we have many that cast down to the ground all Ministers in all the
<PB REF="4">
Reformed Churches. You have cast out Ceremonies in the Sacraments, as the Crosse, kneeling at the Lords Supper: and we have many cast out the Sacraments, Baptisme and the Lords Supper. You have put down Saints dayes: and we have many make nothing at all of the Lords dayes, and Fast dayes. You have taken away the superfluous excessive maintenance of the Bishops, Deanes: and we have many take away and cry down the necessary maintenance of the Ministers. In the Bishops dayes we had singing of Psalmes taken away in some places, conceived prayer, preaching, and in their room, Anthems, stinted forms and reading brought in; and now we have singing of Psalms spoken against and cast out of some Chur|ches, yea all publike prayer questioned, and all ministeriall preaching denyed. In the Bishops times Popish Innovations&punc; were introduced, as bowing at Altars, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and now we have anointing the sick with Oyle; then we had Bishopping of child|ren, now we have Bishopping of men and women, by strange laying on of hands, as is related in this following Book. In the Bishops dayes we had many unlearned Ministers, and have we not now a company of <HI>Jereboams</HI> Priests? In the Bishops dayes we had the fourth Commandement taken away, but now we have all ten Commandements at once by the Antinomians; yea all faith and the Gospell deny|ed, as by the Seekers. The worst of the Prelats, in the midst of many Popish, Ar|minian tenets, and Popish Innovations, held many sound doctrines, and had many commendable practices; yea the very <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Calvini Instructio Ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ersus Libertinos, cap. 4.</HI> pag. <HI>104.</HI></NOTE> Papists hold and keep to many Articles of faith and truths of God, have some order among them, encourage learning, have certain fixed principles of truth, with practises of devotion and good works; but many of the Sects and Secta|ries in our dayes, deny all principles of Religion, are enemies to all holy Duties, Order, Learning, overthrowing all, being <HI>vertiginosi spiritus,</HI> whirlegigg spirits; and the great opinion of an universall Toleration, tends to the laying of all waste, and dissolution of all Religion and good manners. Now are not these Errours, Heresies and Schismes, spots and blots in our Reformation? do they not blemish and cast a dark shadow upon all the light part? are they not the dead flies in the Apothecaries ointment, sending forth a stinking savour? are they not the reproach and rejoycings of the common enemy? the scandall of the weak, the blasing star of the times? and are not Sectaries strangely suffered, connived at, keeping open meetings in the heart of the City? yea printing with <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>M</HI> Salimarsh <HI>Smoak In the Temple,</HI> in which are some des|perate errours.

That Ministers suffer none to preach in the places where they have charge, but such as they will be answerable for</HI>; as the Ordinance a|gainst the preaching of Persons not ordained in this or some other Reformed Church; as the Ordinance of not printing without License; yea upon complaint have questi|oned and troubled some Sectaries for their Errours and pernicious Practises; yet
<PB REF="5">
notwithstanding there is a strange unheard of suffering and bearing with them, and such a one, as I beleeve all things considered, never was there the like under any Orthodox Christian Magistrate and State. How do sects and schismes increase and grow daily, Sectaries doing even what they will, committing insolencies and outrages, not only against the truth of God and the peace of the Church, but the Ci|vill state also, going up and down Countries, causing riots, yea tumults and distur|bances in the publike Assemblies! how do persons cast out of other Countries for their Errours, not only live here, but gather Churches, preach publikely their Opi|nions! what swarmes are there of all sorts of illiterate mechanick Preachers, yea of Women and Boy Preachers!<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">etit. of the Lord Maier Aldermen, and Com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the City of <HI>London</HI> presented to the House of Peers, <HI>Jan. 16.</HI></NOTE> what a number of meetings of Sectaries in this Citiy, eleven at least in one Parish! what liberty of preaching, printing of all Er|rours, or for a Toleration of all, and against the Directory, Covenant, monethly Fast, Presbyteriall Government, and all Ordinances of Parliament in reference to Religion, and most of these persons either never questioned at all, or if questioned, abusing those in a high manner who question them, coming off one way or other, and afterwards going on in spreading their errours more then before, or if committed by some below, whereby they are hindred from preaching and dipping, then brought off and released by some above (of which they bragg and boast) yea many Sectaries countenanced, imployed and preferd to speciall places both of profit, honour and trust, and that which is saddest of all (and yet too true) Orthodox worthy persons, who being in places of Power, for preventing mischiefs and evills questioning some Sectaries for their unlawfull meetings and false Doctrines, have been lookt upon ever after with an evill eye, and opportunities watcht to molest and displace them. In a word there hath not been to this day any exemplary restraint of the Sectaries (as ever I heard) by vertue of any of your Ordinances, but they are sleighted and scorned, and as it was formerly with the Kings Proclamations against the Iesuits, Priests, Papists, and forbidding to go to Masse, there were the more Priests in the Kingdom, and more went to Masse; (the Proclamations being never looked after, and when any zealous Protestants in place did go to execute them, they had little thanks for their pains, and those they questioned were to hard for them, getting off;) so preaching of lay-men was never more in request then since your Ordinance against it; Presbyteriall Government never more preached, printed against, then since your Votes, Orders and Ordinances for it; never more dangerous unlicensed Books printed, then since the Ordinance against unlicensed printing; and when men have been complained of for the breach of Ordinances, as that of lay preaching <HI>&amp;c.</HI> how are they dismissed, and preach still, infect still? look what wayes were taken here|tofore by the Popish party and Prelates who pretended to be Protestants, in fa|vour of the Papists, Arminians, and discountenancing zealous Protestants; the same
<PB REF="6">
will be found to be now in use in behalfe of the Sectaries against Presbyterians; and if you be but pleased to review your own Remonstrances, either in former, or in this present Parliament, or remember the maximes and grounds you proceeded upon in questioning many, and by what rules you judged of intentions to overthrow the Protestant Religion, and to advance Popery, Armianisme, and then look upon the Proceedings of some, you will finde the same steps trod in now, and the same course taken in favour of the sects: (But an Epistle is too narrow a compasse to particularize all things of this kinde, and a word is enough to the wise) And yet I do not say Your Honours have done these things; for there are matters of this nature you hear not of, and upon complaints of things that have come immediatly to Your Houses, there hath been some redresse; yet such things are done by Com|mittees, or Persons under Your Power and Government, and no effectuall wayes taken to prevent, discover or remedy these things. Now I humbly submit to Your deep judgment, whether God account not men guilty of that which is committed by others under them, they having power to hinder it; as also, whether it will not be interpreted by men, that there is certainly great countenance and favour above, or else persons below dare not do as they do. And be pleased to suffer me, as a Mi|nister of Christ, to bring to your remembrance (which I do in all humility,) these following Scriptures. <HI>Levit. 26.25, 1 Sam. 2.29, 30, 31, 32. cap. 3.12.13, 14. 1 King. 12. cap. 31.13. cap. 33.34. 2 King. 10. from 19. to 33.

Revel. 2.13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20.</HI> Which texts of Scripture, with the examples laid down in them, I name not as if I would compare your Honours with <HI>Jeroboam, Belshazzar,</HI> &amp;c. or charge on you their facts in kinde, or that I wish such evills should come to You; no, let the interpretation of these Scriptures be to your enemies, and the fulfilling of them to them that hate You; but because whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, and all the things which were threatned and hapned to <HI>Eli, Jeroboam, Jehu, Belshazzar,</HI> &amp;c. were for ex|amples, and written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come; therefore I minde You of these Scriptures, that you may fear to fall into any such kinde of sins, or to suffer such to be done when 'tis in Your power to hinder.</P>
<P>The sects have been growing upon us ever since the first year of Your sitting, and have every year increased more and more; things have been bad a great while, but this last year they are grown intolerable; and if Schisme, Herosie, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> be let alone and rise proportionably for one year longer, we shall need no Cavaliers nor enemies from without to destroy us. Certainly God looks for other manner of fruit from you; the great Deliverances, Victories, Successes, the solemn Covenant, Pro|testations, Remonstrances, Declarations made to God, this Kingdom, the Kingdome of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and all the Reformed Churches, call and speak for other kinds of
<PB REF="6">
things. The Reformed Churches abroad wonder at these things, and say, Why may not the King as lawfully tolerate Papists, one false Religion, as the Parliament suffer all sects to grow? Besides their love, zeal and prayers for you begins to languish and grow faint. Our dear Brethren of <HI>Scotland</HI> stand amazed and asto|nished, and had they not seen these things, could not have beleeved them. The Or|thodox, godly considerable party, both Ministers and people in City and Country, by whose means under God, you are now so strong and lifted up above your ene|mies, are grieved, offended, and much discouraged; the common enemy scornes, blasphemes, and reproaches the Reformation, looking upon us as given up to a spirit of giddinesse and errour. The Malignants every where turne Sectaries and Inde|pendents, siding with them and pleading their cause; and they do wisely, there being no such way as that to save their purses, live quietly, and to undermine you and effect the enemies work. And what can think you will be issue of these things? It is high time therfore for your Honours to awake and be doing, to suffer no longer these Sects and Schismes, these disorders and confusions that are in the midst of us, but to fall upon some effectuall wayes, as you in your great wisdomes shall finde out, and to do something worthy a Parliament in this kinde also. Do this and God is on your right hand to helpe you, and you shall not be removed for ever, the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Reformed Churches, this great City with the Ministers to stand by you and to honour you: Do it not, but let things still run on thus, and all kinde of errours, confusions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> increase, and know God is a righteous God, and will re|quire it at your hands, visit and be avenged for these things. And let no man flat|ter you with your great prosperity and successe, that your mountain is now so strong that you shall never be moved; but remember that God is a God <HI>changing the times and seasons, that removes Kings and sets up Kings, Dan. 2.21.</HI> that can quickly bring down that part of the wheel below which was highest, that made a sudden change to <HI>Belshazzar</HI> in an hour, <HI>Dan. 5.3, 4, 5, 6.</HI> That God who is said to scatter Kings, can scatter you: <HI>Psal. 68.14.</HI> Look upon the Court party, the great Counsellours of state, and Prelates, whose height was like the height of the Cedars, and were strong as the Oaks, yet the Lord destroyed their fruit from above, and their root from beneath; and cannot he do so to you? I beseech you fear, consi|dering the great dishonour of God and his name, and the sad estate of things under your Goverment, lest God bring some great afterclap upon you, and have an after reckoning, either giving you up at last to the hands of those that are now in armes against you, or sending an evill spirit of division among your selves and the two Nations, or making use of the Sects (that party when grown stronger, who have been so much suffered to grow under you,) to become thorns in your sides, and pricks in your eyes, to cast You out, and to teach you new Law and new Divinity, as they have done already in many of their Books (as <HI>Englands Birthright, A Letter
<PB REF="7">
from an Utter Barrester,</HI> A Letter call'd <HI>Englands lamentable slavery, Lilburns</HI> Letters to <HI>Mr Prynn,</HI> to a Friend, <HI>Innocency and truth justified, cum multis alijs,</HI>) or by sending some other judgement, as the Pestilence, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (all which I ear|nestly pray God to prevent.) And truly when I think of things by my self, and behold to what a height Errours, Heresies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are come, and withall reflect upon the great things God hath done for you, the many powerfull Sermons you have had preached before you about the Nationall Covenant, and against the Sects, the ma|ny Petitions representing the evill and danger of these things, and yet how little is done, our evills of this kinde rising higher and higher, in the increase of false do|ctrines, and a greater multiplication of schismes every day then other; I tremble for fear, lest for the want of zeal in suffering so many dishonours of God, and his House to lie so long waste, the word be gone out of his mouth already which he spake against <HI>Eli; I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy Father should walke before me for ever: but now the Lord saith; Be it far from me, for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.</HI> But to draw towards a conclusion, there is no other way to prevent all this wrath, but to be zealous and repent, to do something speedily and effectually against the Errours, Heresies, Schismes, Blasphemies and confusions of these times.</P>
<P><HI>Ob.</HI> But if any shall object, It cannot be done now, it will discontent and disin|gage the Sectaries who are a considerable party, and so may prove dangerous to the Parliament in this juncture of time, by causing many to fall off their Service.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Are we afraid of discontenting, disingaging and losing a few men, and not discontenting and losing God! shall God be displeased to please men! shall we fear the want of mans helpe whose breath is in his nostrils, and not fear God! O that we would once cease from man, for wherein is he to be accounted of?</P>
<P>Secondly, I Answer, This objection is taking counsell, but not of God; a cover|ing, but not of Gods spirit; <HI>Isa. 30.1.</HI> this carnall policie of suffering corruptions in Religion for fear of losing a party, and strengthening Kingdoms, hath proved the ruin of families and Kingdoms; be pleased to remember <HI>Jeroboam, Jehu,</HI> &amp;c. who out of policie for fear of losing a party and strengthening the other side, set up and suffered the golden Calves and Priests of the lowest of people, and this very thing became a snare, and the losse of the Kingdom to them; and I might shew out of Ecclesiasticall Histories many examples of sad things befalling Princes, who out of policies or any carnall respects, have suffered all sorts of Sects and Heresies; but I will only instance in one out of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ex quo etiam sonte manavit, ut idem Valenti|nianus senior sineret in Occidente inter Christia|nos quam quis vellet fidem amplecti at&abque; pro ar|bitrio haereses consectari.

what Heresies they pleased, but how well and safely the end of it declared; for both his sons were slain by the faction and treachery of the <HI>Gentiles, Gratian</HI> by <HI>Maximus, Valentinian</HI> junior was strangled in a halter: And yet afterwards the same Emperour by edict commanded the houses and places where the Maniches met to be confiscate. 'tis storied of <HI>Amaziah,</HI> that he had hired a hundred thousand mighty men of valour for a hundred talents of silver, but a man of God came to him to dismisse his Army, namely that part of it the children of <HI>Ephraim,</HI> and told him in answer to his carnall objections, that God had power to help and to cast down; and for his hundred talents, the Lord was able to give him much more then this: <HI>2 Chron. 25.7, 8, 9.</HI> so say I, whoever or what numbers soever shall desert the Parliaments Army and Service for their suppressing the Sects, and putting in execution their own Ordinances, God hath power to help, and cast down, and is able to cause many more then these, to adhere to them; and no question, besides Gods help and blessing which uses to accompany setling true Religion, and destroying false; the hands of the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> would be the more strengthened, the City of <HI>London,</HI> the Ministers, and all who love truth, peace and order, would adhere more firmly, and the Parliament would be both stronger, and make themselves famous both at home and abroad to all ge|nerations. Thirdly, supposing the Sectaries to be as potent as is falsely surmised by themselves, yet I humbly conceive it stands not with the Honour, Power, Wisedom nor Piety of a Parliament, for fear of losing a party, to be afraid of maintaining their own Ordinances, and punishing those things that they know are bad; In such a case <HI>fiat justitia, ruet coelum.</HI> Fourthly, the sons of <HI>Zeruiah</HI> are not now too hard for you, God hath made you stornger then ever,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide</HI> more of this in M. <HI>Pryns</HI> Epist.

God infor|ces upon turning the dayes of fasting into <HI>feasts, therefore to love the truth and peace;</HI> and from deliverances to pay our vows, and make good our Covenants, as in <HI>Zech. 8.19.

<P>_IN the last week of <HI>Iune</HI> or the first of <HI>Iuly,</HI> 1644 (in one of those two weeks I am certaine) came forth my Answer (entituled <HI>Antapologia</HI>) to the <HI>Apolog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ticall Narration</HI>: Ever since which time I have forborne the Presse, out of an expectation of a Re|ply (which was with great confidence by many of the Indepen|dent party at severall times given out I should have) with much patience passing by the many reproachfull scornfull speeches and railings both in publike Sermons and printed <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Certain brief Observations and Antiquaeries on</HI> M.

And howe|ver upon the Reason before specifi|ed, I have been thus long silent, and discontinued the Presse; yet for hereafter, I do give it under my hand, that I will make amends, and redeem the time because the dayes are evill; pro|mising (the grace of God enabling me, and sparing me life, health and liberty) that for this next year, or longer, as the troubles of the Church may continue, to be often setting forth one Tractate or other. I aime at, and shall endeavour to be like that tree spoken of in the <HI>Revelation,</HI> to yeeld fruit every moneth, and that the leaves of the tree may be for the healing of these Nations. Now to give some account to the Reader, of the nature of this following Discourse, and of my scope therein; This present Treatise is not so much against any one errour and sect, as against all I have heard of, a Discovery of, and Directions against that many headed monstrous <HI>Hydra</HI> of sectarisme sprung up in these times in <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g|land</HI>: a worke and undertaking, which I well know and expect, will cause me all the hatred, envy and danger, which the cunning, malice, power or blinde zeal of all the sectaries in <HI>England</HI> can procure. <HI>Paul</HI> speaks in his Epistles to the <HI>Corinthians</HI> (among other troubles) of his fighting with beasts at <HI>Ephesus</HI> after the manner of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.32. and of a messenger of Satan sent to buffet him, 2. <HI>Cor. cap.</HI> 12. which were none of the least dangers and sufferings he met with|all, as will appear both by looking into the texts themselves, and consulting some learned Divines upon those Scriptures. Now in this present work, and some o|ther following Tractates, something like to these I have to conflict with, namely, wilde beasts, grievous wolves, as the Scripture calls hereticks and false Prophets, <HI>Mat.</HI> 7.15. <HI>Acts</HI> 20.29. and with messengers of Satan, false Apostles, transform|ing themselves into the Apostles of Christ, 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.13. and 'tis never the lesse ha|zardous nor difficult, that they are wolves in sheeps cloathing, and Satan trans|formed
<PB REF="9">
into an Angell of light. Now for me, a poor weak sinfull man, who have no armes of flesh to back me, none of those relations to the great, Noble and mighty of the times, which many have, (in an age and time when truth is fallen, but heresie and errour prevails in all places, (cried up as new light, and as new truth,) ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, sectarisme is set up in places of honour and profit, and sectaries are delivered,) to appear in open field against, and to contend with them, is a hard and dangerous service. But I know whom I serve, and he who is with me&punc; is stronger then they who are against me: and in this cause of God, his truth, and all the reformed Churches, I fear not what man can do unto me. I well under|stand that I put my hand into a Hornets nest, and shall raise up against me all the spirit of separation, schisme and errour thorowout the Kingdome, from the highest Seeker to the lowest Independent&punc; but I value it not, <HI>jacta est alea</HI> (as <HI>Lu|ther</HI> spake upon a like occasion,) I can comfort my selfe with that of <HI>David, Psal.</HI> 118.12.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The fire of thorns is both kindled and soon quenched.</HI> Ainsworth inlocum.</NOTE> <HI>They compassed not about like Bees, they are quenched as the fire of thorns, but in the Name of the Lord I will cut them off.</HI> That God which delivered <HI>Paul</HI> from beasts at <HI>Ephesus,</HI> and from the messenger of Satan, that encouraged and enabled little <HI>David</HI> to fight with a Bear and a Lion and to pull a Lambe out the Lions mouth yea to kill both the Lion and the Bear, hath doth, and will preserve me till I have finished my testimony. Only my earnest desire is to the Orthodox and Pious Reader, that for the Lord Jesus Christs sake, and for the love of the Spirit, they would strive in prayer to God for me, that I might be delivered from unreasonable euen, and from them that are disobedient; and that my service and labours in this kinde may be a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cepted of the Saints, and that I may be so strengthened with might by his Spirit, that in zeal and faithfullnesse, and yet in love, humility and wisedom&punc; I may speak as I ought to speak in all my following Treatises. There are two things, amongst many, that I have oft thought upon, and observed both from the Scriptures and the works of holy men, both ancient and modern, which in this cause against the Sectaries, makes me not to be troubled at reproa|ches, evill reports, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> First, that those Ministers, who out of zeal to the glory of God, love of his truth, compassion to poor soules, have appeared and acted vigo|rously, by preaching and writing against the errours of the times and places they lived in, have still met with a great deal of malignity, hatred, reproaches, and speaking all manner of evill against them falsely, as also many misconstructions neglects and unkinde dealings from friends. Secondly, Notwithstanding all this, they have gon on in their work and way, with constancie and heroick re|solution, triumphing and rejoycing in their sufferings, rather rising higher, and growing more bold, then being moved or discouraged: of both these I will give some instances: Christ the chief Shepherd and Bishop of our souls, for speaking
<PB REF="10">
against the Sectaries of the time, namely the Pharisees, Sadduces and Herodians, was maligned, reproached, laid in wait for; as also his own Disciples, and <HI>Iohns,</HI> were sometimes offended at him, as <HI>Ioh.</HI> 6.60.61, 66. <HI>Matth.</HI> 9.14.15, 16, 17. and yet Christ endured contradiction of sinners, and bare witnesse to the truth. <HI>Paul</HI> for opposing false teachers, and the errors which had crept into the Church of <HI>Corinth</HI> and <HI>Galatia,</HI> met with great reproaches, bad reports, not only from the false Apostles, but from many of the people, insomuch as they counted <HI>Paul</HI> an enemy, passed judgement on him, and spake contemptibly of him, <HI>Gal.</HI> 4.16.17. 2, <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.10, 11. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.3.8, 9, 10 13.14. And yet <HI>Paul</HI> counted it a small thing to be judged, and could take pleasure in reproaches, in necessities, in persecuti|ons, in distresses for Christs sake, 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.10. and none of these things moved him, so he might finish his course with joy, and the Ministry which he received, to testifie the Gospell of the grace of God, <HI>Acts</HI> 20.24. <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><HI>Nazianz.</HI> Orat. in laudem <HI>Athan.</HI></NOTE> <HI>A|thanasius</HI> for opposing the Arians and detecting their wayes, was conspired against, accused and pursued with an unsupportable hatred; and yet he went on with great zeal and courage against the whole world, which at one time was made Arian, so that he was resembled by the Fathers to an Adamant, for his enduring all things. <HI>Augustine</HI> and <HI>Hierom,</HI> both of them, for preaching and writing against hereticks and schismaticks, especially Donatifts, suffered many reproaches, and yet rejoyced, counting their sufferings a signe of their greater glory; as <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><HI>August.</HI> Epist. 25 Hieronymus Augu|stino, gratulans, illi quod haereticorum omnium meruit odium, quod quidem gaudet sibi cum illo esse commune.

<HEAD>A Catalogue of many of the ERROURS, BLASPHEMIES and PRACTISES of the SECTARIES of the time, with some OBSERVATIONS upon them.</HEAD>
<P>_NOw for this Treatise, I refer it to three heads.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. I shall premise some particulars for the better under|standing of the subject matter of this Book, and right appre|hending of what follows.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. I shall lay down a Catalogue of the Errours, Blasphe|mies, Practises of the Sectaries, together with a particular Narration of sundry remarkable passages, and some Letters concerning them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Give some Observations upon, and draw some Corallaries from the whole matter.</ITEM>

<ITEM>Secondly, Answer two Objections which may be as stones to stumble at in the entrance to the matter, and cause a prejudice against the work.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The first thing I premise, which I would have the Reader to take notice of, is, that this Catalogue of Errours, Blasphemies, Practises, Letters, is not of old Errours, Opinions, Practises, of a former age, dead and buried many yeers ago, and now revived by this Discourse; but a Catalogue of Errours now in being, alive in these present times, all of them vented and broached within these four yeers last past, yea most of them within these two last yeers, and lesse. It should have been long enough, before I would have raked up old Errours from the dead and hell; I had much rather send them back from whence they came; and that is my intent in their Discovery.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ames. Med. The|ol. <HI>lib.</HI> 1. <HI>cap.</HI> 35.</NOTE> I approve well of that rule of Discipline in the French Churches, that the Ministers should not in Sermons meddle with confuting of old Errours; and of that of <HI>Amesius</HI> to Ministers, That all Errour is not every where to be refuted. For old Heresies that are buried; are not to be digged up that they may be refuted; but seeing these walk up and down in City and Country, I may give warning of them. Se|condly,
<PB N="2" REF="13">
This following Discovery is not only of present Errours, which maybe now in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hen I would not have troubled the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> in this Kingdom, as will appear more fully in this Discourse.

<P>Secondly, I do not undertake nor professe in this Catalogue and Discovery, to give a full Catalogue and perfect enumeration of all the erroneous Opinions, Blasphemies and Practises of the Sectaries within these four last yeers, so as no more can be added to them; I make no doubt, but many a Reader may say, this Catalogue wants such an opinion that he knows of, and such an opinion, but only speaks of many of them, and of some principall; and therefore in the Title of this Discourse, I call it a Catalogue of many Errours, (I do not say of all:) It cannot rationally be imagined, that one man residing constantly in one place, not tra|velling to the Armies, nor up and down from Country to Country, having his hands full of preaching, and writing Controversies, can come to the knowledge of all Errours broached in all places, or can have time to read over exactly all the Sectaries, to extr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ct all their Opinions: It may rather be thus argued, what a world of strange Errours, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are there held in all parts of this Kingdom, when one man hears of so much&punc; if all the ministers in the Kingdom would bring in what they know, or but a considerable number of Ministers, as a Committee from severall parts of the Kingdom, would joyn together to read all the Books to take notes of the Sermons in publike, to have some observe and watch meet|ings in private, and draw into one all the wayes of the Sectaries, within these four last yeers, a great volume would not contain the Errours, prodigious: Opini|ons, and strange practises of these times&punc; Ther's no question but there are ma|ny monsters conceived by some in this Intermysticall season, which are not yet brought forth, and others that are brought forth, yet like to bastard or mishapen children, are concealed from the publike view, made known only to a very few, being the hidden works of darknesse, the time not being yet come to pub|lish them openly: waighting only for the Mid-wife and nursing mother of a To|leration,
<PB N="3" REF="13">
to bring them fourth and nourish them: But though this be not a perfect Catalogue, yet I beleeve it will be found the fullest that hath yet been made of these times, and give a further Discovery then yet we have had. I have seen severall Books written within these four last yeers and lesse, that give us a particular Relation of some Errours and blasphemous opinions, as learned <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Gods eye on his Israel.</HI></NOTE> Master <HI>Gat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">kers,</HI> but thats only of the Antinomian Errours; <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><HI>Disswasive from the Er|rours of the time.</HI></NOTE> Master <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ily,</HI> one of the learned and Reverend Commissioners of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but that is only of the Independents, Brownists and Chiliasts. <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><HI>Heresiography.</HI></NOTE> Master <HI>Pa|gets,</HI> who relates more then any late Authors, but many of them are of the old Anabaptists, and old Sectaries of other Countries rather then of the new, and of this Kingdom. <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><HI>Rise, Raign, and Down|fall of the Familists.</HI></NOTE> M^r. <HI>Well,</HI> but his relation is cheifly of the Familists and Antinomians in <HI>New-England</HI> many yeers ago.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Dippers dipt, Doctor Faeatly.</HI></NOTE> But this work as it speaks only of the Errours and Opinions in present being and in <HI>England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A brief Discovery of Fa|milisme.</HI></NOTE> so it disco|vers more then any one Book hath, of the Errours held and maintained among us; yea then all the Tractates extant have discovered, many great Errours being in this present Treatise laid down, which are not mentioned at all, neither by the forenamed Authors, nor any other, so that this present Discourse will be a further improvement of our knowledge of the Errours and wayes of the Sectaries of our times.</P>
<P>Thirdly, My intent in this work, is not to make a formall confutation of these Errours and Opinions; I designed not that when I first resolved the thing (that would be a long and great work, and not make good my present ends,) I hope the naming of them will be a sufficient confutation, especially with the Animadversions, Observations, and Corallaries hereunto adjoyned: I have been a faithfull gatherer together and storer up, Remembrancer and Treasu|rer of these Errours and Practices for the good of the publike, that I might in a fit season bring out of my treasure these things, and discover these monsters and rocks, that so they might be of some use to godly people, to make them afraid of forsaking the publike Assemblies, and joyning to separated Chur|ches where these monsters daily breed.</P>
<P>Fourthly, I here give the Reader a Synopsis of Sectarisme, and have drawn as is were into one Table, and do present at one view, the Errours and strange opinions scattered up and down, and vented in many Books, Manuscripts, Ser|mons, conferences, &amp;c. and have disposed them under certain heads, and put them into their proper places, in a methodicall way for memories sake, that the Reader may the more easily find them. The Reader cannot imagine I found them thus methodized and laid together, but confused and divided, ly|ing
<PB N="4" REF="14">
far asunder, one or two in one book, some in another; others in this ma|nuscript, others in that; this errour vented at such a private meeting, that errour in such a Sermon, this opinion at such a conference: For many of these opini|ons, the very same opinions and errours are maintained and held over and over in severall books and manuscripts, so that to have given them the Reader as I found them, would have been to have brought the Reader into a wildernesse, and to have presented to publick view a rude and undigested Chaos, with an heap of Tautologies, all which are carefully declined in this following discourse, by joyning in one things divided and scattered; by relating but once one and the same errour and practice, and by forbearing to lead the Reader thorow woods, and over the mountains; and in stead of that, carrying him directly and presently to the bird in the nest.</P>
<P>Fifthly, I lay down the opinions and errours <HI>in terminis,</HI> and in their owne words and phrases syllabically, as neer as possible can be, or I can remember them; and that as themselves have expressed them in books, manuscripts, ser|mons, conferences, which either are extant of their own setting forth, or set forth by other learned godly men in print, or as I have received them from credible sufficient witnesses. I doe not in this Catalogue and Discovery alter the phrases and words of the Sectaries, giving you their sense in other expres|sions; nor set down a Relation of their opinions by consequences and dedu|ctions, imputing that to them which by consequences may be drawn (for I hold that an unjust way of dealing with men, though in errours); <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Sentent. Quorund<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m Past.

Fit e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">im saepenuraero, ut qui principium tenet ex quo aliquid concluditur, idem tamen id nesciat quod ex eo colligitur.</HI></NOTE> yea, many men may hold opinions, who yet see not the consequences, nay ab|horre those consequences which yet follow upon such premisses; and therefore though in a way of argument they may be pressed upon them to draw them off their errours, yet they may not be charged upon them: and therefore though in the setting down of the errours and the things thereto annexed, as Letters, some phrases and words may not be so proper, nor so good English; yet the Reader must not be offended, because I would relate things in their own words to take away all cavill.</P>
<P>Sixthly, For the proof and manifestation of the truth and reality of the er|rours, blasphemies and practices contained in this present Tractate, that the Reader may not rest upon my bare assertion and relation of them, but may have other grounds of satisfaction for their belief, and so be more affected with them, I propound these following particulars as grounds of proof.</P>

a notoriety of them, being so notoriously known to thousands, and maintained by thousands, every day and every place witnessing the truth of them; that to quote books written and sermons preached for them, or persons holding them, is to lose time; and when all is alledged that can be, 'tis far beneath the evidences that the mentioning of the things themselves give.</P>
<P N="2">2. Many errours and blasphemies contained in this following Catalogue have been complained of, and particulars given in by sufficient persons to the Parliament, Committees of Parliament, Assembly of Divines, and others in au|thority, of which errours I have had either perfect copies given me from Mini|sters both of the Assembly and City, or relations from their mouths who have known particularly the story and truth of them, which copies I keep by mee to produce if need be, and out of which (amongst many other papers and books) I made up this Catalogue.</P>
<P N="3">3. Some of the errours, blasphemies and practices are proved and made ma|nifest in the narration of the Stories and Letters following the Catalogue: wherein the naming of some persons, places, occasions of writing, the persons writ unto, their writing in a publick way, and not in a private manner, the wil|lingnesse to have them published, with many other concurrent circumstances, do declare they are not feigned nor counterfeited, but reall and certain.</P>
<P N="4">4. Of some of these errours and practices here related, I my self, and other persons of good note and quality, have at the same time together been ear-witnesses and eye-witnesses upon the places.</P>
<P N="5">5. Other of these errours and opinions are in divers printed books, either of the Sectaries themselves, or of persons of note and worth for learning and piety, who either after conferences with them, or hearing them preach, upon certain knowledge have printed and attested them to the world; diverse of which printed books, especially those made by the Sectaries, I quote upon the margent by the errours.</P>
<P N="6">6. For any of the errours, blasphemies put in this following Catalogue, which have come to my knowledge by none of the former five wayes above specified (which yet are not many) I have had the relation of them from godly Ministers, and understanding conscientious Christians, with many circumstances of names, places, conditions, time, and confident asseverations of the certainty of them, the relations coming to me by providence, and occasionally spoken of in the hearing of others as well as my selfe, and so delivered as there can be no reason in the world to think they should be false, but much every way to be|leeve them true. And that the Reader may the more build upon the truth of all things delivered in this Book; besides that account I have given him alrea|dy in these six particulars, I shall acquaint the Reader with the course and way
<PB N="6" REF="15">
I have taken to come to the truth of things, and not to go upon hearsay. When any things of this nature have been related to me, though by persons of worth and conscience, I have used to enquire of them, whether they were ear-witnesses or no; if not ear-witnesses, who they had the reports from, and how they came to know them, and where, and by whom, and upon what occasion these points were delivered? if they said they were ear and eye witnesses, yet if there were but one single witnesse, I have used to question, who else was present? and to enquire after circumstances and occasions, and accordingly have gone to other persons named, from one to another, to find out the bottome and truth both of Opinions held, and practises used; where I could with wisdome and probabi|lity go to finde out and know the truth, I have done it myself; and where my appearing might hinder the discovery, and cause persons to be shie and more reserved, I have set others to enquire, and directed them the way, and en|treated them to aske such and such questions, and after particular enquiry, ac|cording to concurrence of circumstances and witnesses, I have entertained such things for truth, or else received them as false, or suspended them as doubtfull, not to be asserted: and that I might be the more faithfull Relator of the opini|ons and wayes of the Sectaries of this time, and know when and where to put more or lesse weight or credit upon informations and relations, I have a long time used to write down daily the same day, yea the same hour (when I could get opportunty of privacie) the occurrences both of opinions and practises that concern our Sectaries, and that in such manner and way, that looking up|on my papers a yeer after, I can judge of what authority the relations are: and accordingly I have forborn to put into this Catalogue of Errours, some strange Opinions I have heard of from good hands (though they may be true) because I have not had the opportunity to meet with, and further to enquire of some persons concerning their truth; and because some whom I have enquired of, could give me no further satisfaction. I have taken this way, to satisfie the Reader, rather then all along in the severall Errours, Blasphemies and Practi|ses to lay down the particular proofs; which I think the better way upon these following reasons. 1. Because in many of the Errours, even contained under one and the same head, the proofs to be given of the truth of the thing doth arise many wayes, from printed Books, from Manuscripts, from Sermons, from preaching in private houses, from Articles given in by witnesses, and from o|thers relations; now to quote all these, with all particular circumstances of time, place, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whereby to make out a full proof, would be an endlesse work, and be so long and tedious, that it would crosse one of my ends in this work, which is to have this Discourse but short, a Manuall that might be for every ones reading. 2. Because some of these Errours and Opinions can be proved
<PB N="7" REF="15">
only from Manuscripts, and relations of honest persons, who were ear witnes|ses, which Manuscripts are but in the hands of a few, unknown to most of the Readers; and to make references to them, by quoting them in the margent, the Reader were never the neerer, and then every man is not willing to be named in Print, neither may I lawfully do it without their knowledge and leave; besides, that were the way for the future, to deprive my self of the knowledge of many opinions and practises, if I should print the names of every one that hath impar|ted intelligence to me. 3. In this Catalogue of Errours, under one and the same Errour (which for number I make but one, that I might not seem needlesly to multiply Errours, and that I might contract things) yet under that one Er|rour, teere are more branches, it may be two or three; now though one part or branch of such an Errour as the former part is expresly set down in Books that are in many hands, yet other branches are not, but only have been expres|sed by word of mouth: Now in such a case to quote Books, speaking but to one part and not to the whole, might question my faithfulnesse in all other par|ticulars: unto these I could adde more, but these may suffice.</P>
<P N="7">7. Yet further to satisfie the Reader of the truth of things contained in this present Treatise, and to stop the mouths of Sectaries, who will be ready to put off all, by giving out, that this Book is full of lies and fables, I do here offer (up|on condition that some exemplary punishment may passe upon some of the prime Seducers and heads of these Sects, and some effectuall course taken for the future, to remedy and suppresse these Errours) to make a legall proof by witnesses, and other concurrent circumstances of the most notorious and grossest matters (which may of all others seem most questionable) whether Errours, Blasphemies or Practices set down in this following Catalogue.</P>
<P>Seventhly, I premise this for the Christian Reader to remember, and for pre|venting mistakes in this work, that though I set down and joyn together all the following opinions in one Catalogue, because they all agree in <HI>uno tertio</HI> in that common notion of Errour, yea all agree in Independency, and in forsaking the communion of the Reformed Churches: yet I am far from thinking them all alike. A Scholar that makes a Catalogue of Books, writes down <HI>Decimo sextos</HI> as well as <HI>Folios</HI> in it, because they be all Books, and yet puts a great deal of dif|ference between the one and the other; so do I notwithstanding I put them toge|ther. All the Errours reckoned up are not of the first magnitude, nor in the high|est form; some are fundamentall Errours, overthrowing the foundation di|rectly, many by consequence and deduction; others are superstructures, build|ing upon the foundation hay, straw and stubble: I put a wide difference between a simple pure Independent, yea a simple Anabaptist, who only holds that opini|on of denying Poedobaptisme, and between an Arian, Antitrinitarian, Anti|scripturist,
<PB N="8" REF="16">
Perfectist: Again, I put a difference between erroneous persons that erre out of ignorance, weaknesse, and are seduced, following those opinions in simplicity of heart (as some people did <HI>Absolom</HI>) and are peaceable keeping their opinions also to themselves and such persons as are wilful seducers, the heads and leaders of Faction, who make it their work to disturb the peace of the Church, and to subvert souls. In all this discourse I desire to think of <HI>Iude</HI> 22.23. <HI>And of some have compassion, making a difference; and others save with fear, pulling them, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Eighthly, I desire to forewarn the Christian Reader, and do earnestly be|seech him for his own good, that he be not offended, nor hindred from beleev|ing the truth, and laying to heart the particulars laid down in this ensuing Treatise, no not by all the clamours, reproaches that may be cast upon my Book and person: It cannot be expected, but that Satan and the Sectaries will make it their work, by all wayes possible to blast this Book, to keep from reading and be|leeving it, as they used all wayes to reproach my last Book, and to keep Christi|ans all they could from reading it: Blind and erroneous zeal is violent and what it wants in arguments, it will make up in clamours, lyes, and speaking all manner of evil falsly of them that discover &amp; lay it open, as <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Mundus non potest fer|re ut sua damuentur: Igi|tur ex omni parte odia, in|sidiae, calumniae, maledicta congeruntur ad opprimen|dam hanc doctrioam &amp; edoctores hos.</NOTE> <HI>Luther</HI> speaks; the world cannot bear that the things of it should be condemned, therefore from every part hatreds, treache|ries, calumnies, evill speakings are heaped to oppresse that Doctrine, and those Teachers who oppose it: And there|fore let them speak evill as long as they will, and give out 'tis a railing lying peece; yet let me speak to the Reader, as the Apostle doth, 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 3.3, 4. <HI>That no man should be moved by these afflictions, for we told you be|fore, that we should suffer tribulation, even as its come to passe, and ye know</HI>: so now I tell you before, that when you hear of all kind of reproaches, ye may not be offended, <HI>Iohn</HI> 16.1.</P>
<P>Now the second particular under this first generall head, is to remove two stumbling blocks out of the way, to give an answer to two objections that may be made against this present work.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Object.</HI> It may be some will object and say; It is not seasonable nor con|venient to discover our nakednesse and weaknesse so far to the common enemy, it were better concealed, the enemy will make an advantage of it: <HI>Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines re|joyce, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</HI> 2. Sam. 1.20.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> The prevailing of Heresies and Sects among us, is not now to be disco|vered and published to the world: It hath not been all this time kept within our own walls, and known only to our selves, but hath been a long time known abroad, and at home, and hath been declared by divers others, both in writing
<PB N="9" REF="16">
and preaching before now: so that I shall not divulge any secret to the com|mon enemy: all that I do is but to draw them into one, that we may see them as it were at once: our Errours and Schisms are spoken of far and near by ene|mies and friends. How many Sermons have been preached before the Honoura|ble Houses of Parliament, and in other publike places speaking of the Errours of the time, which have been also printed long since by command of Authority, and exposed to the view of all? Many Learned men have given a Catalogue of severall Errours, as Mr. <HI>Gataker</HI> of many Antinomian Errours, M^r <HI>Baily</HI> one of the Commissioners of <HI>Scotland</HI> of other Errours, and D^r <HI>Featly,</HI> M^r <HI>Paget,</HI> with some others: In Books upon all occasions, 'tis confessed by men of <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">M. Colemans <HI>Brotherly exa|mination Re-examined,</HI> pag. 10 <HI>grants, That in our present times monsters of Errours do arise, and Opinions that the world ne|ver heard of before.</HI></NOTE> severall judgemens, and denied by none, that we have many great Errours amongst us: many Er|rours have been complained of to the Houses of Parli|ament, Committees, Assembly, and examined, spoken of in the presence of many; besides that some Errours are vented, even of the grossest sort in Print, as in <HI>Pilgrimage of Saints, Bloudy Tenet, Mortality of the soul, Man of sinne discovered, cum multis aliis:</HI> Yea, some of the Sectaries have in their writings published and acknowledged, there are many sorts of Opinions among us, hence taking occasion to write for a Toleration of all, as Anabap|tists, Antinomians, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the great Historian and Chronicler of the Sectaries (the <HI>Moderate Intelligencer, Num.</HI> 36. who writes their lives and deaths, and trum|pets forth their victories and praises so immoderatly as if they did all: and hath published to the world, some weeks ago, that there are twenty severall opinions in the Army; and hath pleaded more then once for liberty of conscience for them all; so that I by writing in this kind of the Errours of the time, cannot be guilty of discovering our nakednesse, the enemy having known so much before. But why stand I to prove that our Heresies and Schisms are openly known in <HI>England,</HI> when as their sound is gone into all Lands, into <HI>Holland, Zealand, France,</HI> yea to <HI>New-England</HI>? The <HI>Walachrian</HI> Classis, in their Letter to the <HI>London</HI> Sy|nod complain much of Heresies, Schisms, Errours, confusions in Religion spreading in the City, which by such an expresse, holy and sacred oath is bound to God to cast out all Errours, Heresies, Scisms out of the house of God. <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><HI>Considerat.

<P>Secondly supposing our errours to be known, which is fully proved in any first Answer, I then secondly say, 'tis so farre from being unseasonable and in|convenient, that 'tis most necessary, that some Ministers, who are friends to the Reformation, and zealots for the Parliament, should lay them open to the full, by testifying against them and disclaiming them, that so our enemies may not say, wee favour and countenance them; and one of my great ends in this Tractate, is to take away occasion from the common enemy to blaspheme the Reforma|tion, and speak ill of the Parliament, by our not owning them, but speaking as much against heresie, schisme and all errours as any of them can.</P>
<P>Thirdly, I answer, we should be so farre from being afraid to give the com|mon enemy advantage, by speaking against heresies and errours, that on the con|trary I may say, we have no such enemies, as those persons, that broach and spread their heresies and damnable opinions: these are our enemies which wee have cause to fear more then all the Cavaliers, these are the <HI>Achans,</HI> the accursed persons, and things which are most likely to undo us; and if ever the Parlia|ment and their party be ruined (which God prevent) it will not be so much by the Cavaliers, they could not have done it, but the heresies, blasphemies and schimes of some among our selves will cause it; and therefore the finding of these out, and labouring to have these removed, is a work of great importance to the saving of the Kingdom, and of great prejudice to the common enemy, whose hopes and confidence are much more placed in our heresies, prodigious opinions and schismes, then in their own strength.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Ob.</HI> As this book will give occasion to open the mouthes of enemies, so it may cause distractions and divisions among our selves, weaken the hands of many who are cordiall to the Parliament, apprehending themselves to be writ|ten against; besides this may offend many good persons that are not sectaries, especially that Independents should be put into this Catalogue, and ranked with all sorts of hereticks and schismaticks.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="11" REF="17">1. I answer to this, as <HI>Luther</HI> did in an Epistle of his to <HI>Spalatinus</HI> upon a like occasion; <HI>Spalatinus</HI> would not have had <HI>Luther</HI> at such a time to have writ against the Papists, for feare of disturbing the publike peace: to whom <HI>Luther</HI> thus replies, <HI>Thats excellent indeed, that thou thinkest it not fit to have the publike peace disturbed, and yet judgest it fit to have the externall peace of God disquieted; not so, O Spalatine.</HI> Shall the grievous wolves come freely to the flock, not sparing them; and if the doggs barke to give warning of them, shall they be said to di|sturbe the peace, and cause distractions? Brethren, things are come to a good passe, that hereticks and sectaries must do what they please, and if any course be taken by preaching, writing, petitioning, to remedy it, 'tis given out by Secta|ries, 'tis a plot to make division, discourage the Army, disturbe the peace. I say no more, if this be to preserve union and peace, and to be cordiall to the Parlia|ment, to let hereticks and sectaries do what they list, preach, writ, spread their errours, destroy many souls, and no man must say, what do they? cursed be that union, peace and affection to the Parliament. <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><HI>Lutherus</HI> in epist. ad <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lat.</HI> Male|dicta sit charitas quae servatur cum jactura doctrinae fidei, cui omnia cede|re debent, Charitas, Apostolus, Angelus &eacute; Caelo.</NOTE> 'Tis a golden saying of <HI>Luther,</HI> and worthy to bee thought of in these times; <HI>Cursed be that charity which is kept with the losse of the doctrine of faith, to which all things ought to give place, Charity, an A|postle, an Angell from Heaven,</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><HI>This present Parliament having often declared in their Declarations, their reso|lutions to hazard all for the safety of the Reformed Religion and doctrine of faith.</HI></NOTE> yea, and I will add, Parliaments.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 2. If in such a time as this, and such a case, when by many persons all the things of God are laid waste and made null, Church, Minister, Sacraments, Scriptures, and what not? men will be offended for speaking, let them, 'tis bet|ter they should be offended, then the glory of Christ should suffer; 'tis an of|fence taken, and not given; Christ cared not in that case that the Pharisees were offended, <HI>Mat.</HI> 15.12.13.14. I wonder they are not offended at the heresies and errours daily broached, and yet should be offended at the discovering and speaking against them. I have more cause to be offended at this objection of theirs, and their lukewarmenesse: wo be unto them that broach these errours, and to those that countenance them, for <HI>every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 3. I name not these things to provoke and exasperate any, especially none of those who in simplicity of heart, and under pretences of greater holi|nesse and new light, are taken in these wayes; (for as I have writ before, so I say again, I put a great difference between Independency strictly and properly so cal'd, and many other sectaries, and between those who are turbulent Secta|ries, and meerly seduced) but I write this Tractate to preserve many tender consciences from falling, by giving warning to them beforehand, as Christ did in <HI>Mat.</HI> 24.23.24.25.26. that they may fear, and tremble, and look to
<PB N="12" REF="18">
themselves, as also that I might brand errours and false doctrine too well thought of, and too kindly delt with in these times.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 4. I may justifie the ranking and joyning of Independents with other sectaries, not only because all the sectaries though never so vild, are Indepen|dents, agreeing in that opinion of Independencie; as also all the sectaries, the worst of them (even those who deny the Scriptures, the Divinity of Christ, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) do separate from the Church of <HI>England,</HI> refusing communion with her in the Sacraments and other Ordinances as the Independents do, but because the In|dependents do joyn themselves with the other sectaries adhering to them, and to this day have never stood as a divided party from them, but upon all occa|sions have and do make one common body with them, to hold together against the Orthodox and Presbyterians: I am able to give many instances of many of the Independents, both Ministers and people, pleading for the Anabaptists, An|tinomians and other sectaries, that they might be tolerated as well as them|selves; and upon all occasions of complaints against severall sects, siding with them to bring them off; yea, their joyning together in choise of Burgesses for Parliament, and in divers other matters against the Presbyterians; as also in closing together in Church-fellowship, Independent Churches admitting of and continuing Anabaptists, Antinomians to be members; besides not censuring vild sectaries (as Seekers) who have fallen from their Churches: so that I do the Independents no wrong to put them in the same Catalogue with other sectaries, themselves having in so many particulars gone hand in hand with them: but that which is the fullest demonstration of all other, is this, The secta|ries being now hot upon the getting of a Toleration, there were some meetings lately in the City, wherein some persons of the severall sects, some Seekers, some Anabaptists, some Antinomians, some Brownists, some Independents met; some Presbyterians also met with them, upon their desire the better to under|stand what they would have; the intent of which meeting was, to consider how all these might have the liberty to their way and practice in this Kingdom, and to perswade the Presbyterians to be willing to it, and to helpe to effect it for them: now the result of these meetings was, that all these severall sects were agreed and held together for pretended liberty of conscience, the Independents as well as the others holding together with the rest of the sects, as buckle and thong; some professing at one of the meetings, it was the sin of this Kingdom that the Jewes were not allowed the open profession and exercise of their reli|gion amongst us; only the Presbyterians dissented and opposed it. And much about the same time that this meeting was in <HI>London,</HI> in another place some of the best of the Independents, were not ashamed to move for a Toleration, not only for themselves, but all other of the sects that agreed in fundamentals against Popery.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="18">THe second part of this Tractate, and indeed the principall (to the better understanding whereof the first part tended, and upon which also the third and last is grounded) sets down the Catalogue it self, containing many Er|rours, Blasphemies and Practises of the sectaries of this time, together with a Narrative of some remarkable Passages and stories; as also, some Letters, and an extract of Letters concerning the present Sects. Now the Errours, Heresies, Blasphemies in this Catalogue particularized, may be referred to sixteen heads or sorts of Sectaries, as namely, 1. Independents. 2. Brownists. 3. Chiliasts, or Millenaries. 4. Antinomians. 5. Anabaptists. 6. Manifestarians or Armini|ans. 7. Libertines. 8. Familists. 9. Enthusiasts. 10. Seekers and Waiters. 11. Perfectists. 12. Socinians. 13. Arians. 14. Antitrinitarians. 15. Anti|scripturists. 16. Scepticks and Questionists, who question every thing in mat|ters of Religion; namely, all the Articles of Faith, and first Principles of Chri|stian Religion, holding nothing positively nor certainly, saving the doctrine of pretended liberty of conscience for all, and liberty of Prophesying. And in one or other of these sixteen formes, may all the Errours and Blasphemies reckoned up in the following Catalogue be well placed, and unto one of these heads ea|sily reduced; yea, for many of these errours, the very same are held not only by one sort of the forenamed sects, but by divers of them. And I desire to commend to the Readers serious and sad consideration, three particulars concerning the errours and sects of this time; and the rather, because they were not so common to the sects in the ages before, at least not the two first. 1. That among all these sorts of sects and sectaries, there are hardly now to be found in <HI>England</HI> (for to this Kingdom, and to these four last years do I confine my self all along in this discourse) any sect thats simple and pure, and not mixt and compounded, that is, any sect among them all) which holds only the opinions and principles of its own way, without enterfering and mingling with the errours of other sects; as for example, where can a man finde a Church of simple Anabaptists, or simple Antinomians, or simple pure Independents, each of them keeping to their own principles, as Anabaptists to Anabaptisme, Independents to Independen|cie, and holding no other? but rather do we not see by experience, that both the severall kinds of sects, and most persons of each kinde, are compounded of many, yea, some of all: One and the same society of persons in our times, being both Anabaptisticall, Antinomian, Manifestarian, Libertine, Socinian, Millenary, Independent, Enthusiasticall? yea, among the Independents (who are of all the rest accounted best) where can any man shew me an Independent Church strict|ly so called, or a man of them hardly, who symbolizes not with the other sects, holding beside Independency, neither the opinions of the Chiliasts, nor of the Libertines, nor other strange opinions! The Army that is so much spoken of upon all occasions in the news Books, Pulpits, Conferences, to be Independent
<PB N="14" REF="19">
(though I conceive upon good information, that upon a true muster of the whole, Commanders and common souldiers, there would not be found above one in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ix of that way) yet of that Army, cal'd by the sectaries, Independent, and of that part of it which truly is so, I do not think there are 50. pure Indepen|dents, but higher flown, more Seraphicall (as a Chaplain, who knows well the state of that Army, expressed it) made up and compounded of Anabaptisme, Antinomianisme, Enthusiasme, Arminianisme, Familisme, all these errours and more too sometimes meeting in the same persons, strange monsters, having their heads of Enthusiasme, their bodies of Antinomianisme, their thighs of Familisme, their leggs and feet of Anabaptisme, their hands of Arminianisme, and Libertinisme as the great vein going thorow the whole; in one word, the great Religion of that sort of men in the Army, is liberty of conscience, and liberty of preaching. But heretofore, both in times more ancient and latter, and in other Countries, severall sects kept themselves more to their own proper tenets, without that generall con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">usion of each running into all, as the Arians, Novatians and others, in the first six hundred years, and the Antinomians in <HI>Luthers</HI> time. Secondly, That all these sorts of sects, how different soever, yea and contrary to one another in many principles and opinions, yet all agree in these times in separating from our Church, refusing comunion in our publike Assemblies, and in disallowing the authoritative power of Classes and Synods; all the sects, yea the worst of them, as the Antiscripturists, Arians, Antitrinita|rians, Perfectists, being Independents and Separatists (though all Independents and Separatists be not Arians, Antinomians, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) which deserves the more to be thought on, because in the Primitive times, some heriticks and sectaries would have been glad of communion in warship with the Orthodox; (<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Theodoret. Haeret. Fabul. <HI>lib.</HI> 4. <HI>cap.</HI> de Ario.</NOTE> <HI>Arius</HI> desired to be received into the Church of <HI>Alex|andria</HI> again, and made such friends to <HI>Constantine,</HI> that upon his pretending repentance, he commanded <HI>Alexander</HI> the Bishop of <HI>Alex|andria,</HI> to give him the hand of fellowship and to admit him) as also they appro|ved of the power of Synods and Councels, comming unto them.

<HEAD>The Catalogue of the Errours, Heresies, Blasphemies, is as follows.</HEAD>

<ITEM>2. That the Scripture,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pamphlet intituled</HI> Pilgrim. of Saints, <HI>by.</HI> Lawr. Clarckson.</NOTE> whether a true manuscript or no, whether Hebrew, Greek or English, is but humane, and so not able to discover a divine God. Then where is your command to make that your Rule or Discipline, that cannot reveal you God, nor give you power to walke with God? so that Christ letting out himself as he is in him|self, ought to be a Christians Rule in obedience to himself.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That the Scriptures are unsufficient and uncertain, there is no certainty to build any D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ctrine upon them, they are not an infallible foundation of faith.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. As the condition of <HI>Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses,</HI> &amp;c. was, that they did walke with God by the teaching of God, so is ours: that is not to limit Christ to <HI>Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, Iohn</HI> and the Disciples. As they were not to tye God to any things before them recorded, but each of them
<PB N="16" REF="20">
had a new record; so are not we to limit God in the generall records of those paths, but wait upon him in the enlargement of the Gospell what he will re|cord you; and far be it from me to conclude either in Doctrine or practise; that half of his glory is revealed as yet: As that I should enclose Christ in such a small compasse as we have recorded:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pilgrim. of Saints.</HI></NOTE> though I rejoyce to understand it in the searching thereof, yet pressing toward the marke for the price of the high calling of God, waiting what he will record in my heart, and in that measure worship him in spirit and truth from the teaching of the Spirit.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. That the holy writings and sayings of <HI>Moses</HI> and the Prophets, of Christ and his Apostles, and the proper Names, Persons and things contained therein are Allegories, and these Allegories are the mystery and spirituall meaning of them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. That the Penmen of Scripture, every one of them, writ as themselves con|ceived, they were the actions of their own spirit; and for what is said they were moved by the holy Ghost, that was no other Spirit then that which moved them to writ and speak other things, for in him we live and move and have our being.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. That the Scriptures of the old Testament, do not concerne nor binde Christians now under the new Testament: so that when places of Scripture are brought out of the old Testament to prove Points, many Sectaries make slight of them, and say, Give us a text out of the new, we are ignorant of the old; and hereupon some of them do not binde the old Testament with the new, nor read it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. That right Reason is the rule of Faith, and that we are to beleeve the Scriptures, and the Doctrine of the Trinity, Incarnation, Resurrection, so far as we see them agreeable to reason, and no farther.</ITEM>
<ITEM>9. That the new Testament, nor no place of Scripture in it, binds any further then the Spirit for present reveales to us that such a place is the Word of God.</ITEM>
<ITEM>10. To read Scripture in English to a mixt Congregation without present expounding it, is dangerous, and worse then to read it in Latine; for in Latine, as it doth no good, so it doth no harme.</ITEM>

<ITEM>15. That a man had life before God breathed into him, and that which God breathed into him was part of the divine Essence, and shall returne unto God again.</ITEM>
<ITEM>16. That we should think of our selves no better then was meet, for God loves the creatures that creep upon the ground as well as the best Saints; and there is no distance between the flesh of a Man, and the flesh of a Toad.</ITEM>
<ITEM>17. That the Prince of the ayr that rules in the children of disobedience is God; and that there is no other spirit but one, which Spirit is God.</ITEM>

<ITEM>21. That the soul dies with the body, and all things shall have an end, but God only shall remain for ever.</ITEM>
<ITEM>22. Every creature in the first creation was God, and every creature is God, every creature that hath life and breath being an efflux from God, and shall re|turne into God again, be swallowed up in him as a drop is in the ocean.</ITEM>

<ITEM>28.

<ITEM>29. That we did look for great matters from one crucified at <HI>Ierusalem</HI> 16 hundred yeares ago,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Proof of this is, in Articles given in against on</HI> Thomas Webb, <HI>and in the third printed Letter.</HI></NOTE> but that does us no good, it must be a Christ formed in us, the deity united to our humanity, Christ came into the world to live thirty two years, and to do nothing else that he knew, and blessed God he never trusted in a crusified Christ.</ITEM>
<ITEM>30. Christ was true man when he created us: yea from eternity, and though he had not flesh, yet was he very man without flesh.</ITEM>
<ITEM>31. That Christ died for all men alike, for the reprobate as well as for the elect, and that not only sufficiently, but effectually, for <HI>Iudas</HI> as well as <HI>Peter,</HI> for the damned in hell as well as the Saints in Heaven.</ITEM>
<ITEM>32. That by Christs death, all the sins of all the men in the world, Turks, Pagans, as well as Christians committed against the morall Law and first Cove|nant, are actually pardoned and forgiven, and this is the everlasting Gospel.</ITEM>

<ITEM>34. Christ died only for sins past, <HI>i. e.</HI> before the Gospel is revealed to the sinner, and the sins of men committed after conversion Christ died not for, but they are pardoned by his being a continuall sacrifice.</ITEM>
<ITEM>35. Every man satisfies for himselfe for the sins against the second Cove|nant, namely unbelief: because he that beleeves not, the wrath of God abides up|on him; so that for a years unbelief a man beares a years wrath, and this is all the satisfaction God requires.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vide <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">irst printed Letter for proof.</HI></NOTE></ITEM>

<ITEM><NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Vide <HI>fourth Letter proof.</HI></NOTE>40. Christ Jesus came into the world to witnesse and declare the love of God to us, not to procure it for us, or to satisfie God (as some say,) Christ was a most glorious publisher of the Gospel, he was sent to preach the Gospel, to heal the broken hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives: in all that Christ saith to be the end of his coming is not a word men|tioned of any thing done by him in way of satisfying God. Christs coming was more like a conquerour to destroy the enemy in our nature, and so to convince us of the love of God to us by destroying in our nature that which we thought stood between God and us.</ITEM>

<ITEM>43. That Christ shall come and live again upon the earth, and for a thou|sand years reign visibly as an earthly Monarch over all the world, in outward glory and pomp, putting down all Monarchy and Empires.</ITEM>
<ITEM>44. That when Christ in his own person hath subdued the disobedient Na|tions, then the Church of the Jews and Gentiles shall live without any distur|bance, from within or without it: all Christians shall live without sin, without the Word, Sacraments, or any Ordinance, they shall passe those thousand yeers in worldly delights, begetting many children, eating and drinking, and enjoy|ing all lawfull pleasures which all the creatures then redeemed from their an|cient slavery can afford.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="20" REF="22">45. That men may be saved without Christ, and the very Heathens are sa|ved, if they serve God according to the knowledge God hath given them, though they never heard of Christ.</ITEM>
<ITEM>46. That the least Truth is of more worth then Jesus Christ himself.</ITEM>
<ITEM>47. Christ by his death freed all men from a temporall death which <HI>Adams</HI> sin only deserved, by purchasing them a resurrection, and hath opened them&punc; a way to come to the Father if they will: thus far he died for all, no farther for any.</ITEM>

<ITEM>53. That sanctification is not an evidence of Justification, and all notes and signes of a Christians estate are legall and unlawfull.</ITEM>
<ITEM>54.

<ITEM>69. True faith is without all doubts of salvation, and if any man have doubts of his salvation, his faith is to be noted with a black mark.</ITEM>
<ITEM>70. That <HI>To credere</HI>; faith in a proper sense is imputed to justification, and not Christs righteousnesse imputed to justification.</ITEM>
<ITEM>71. That the doctrine of repentance is a soul-destroying doctrine.</ITEM>
<ITEM>72. In the old Covenant (that is before Christ came in the flesh) in the Prophets dayes, repentance is declared as a means to obtain remission, and nei|ther remission nor the knowledge of remission to go before, but to follow contrition; but this is not the Gospel which is established upon better pro|mises.</ITEM>

<HEAD>A Catalogue of the Blasphemies of the Sectaries.</HEAD>
<P>NOw besides these Errours and Heresies laid down, many of them being Blasphemies (as the Reader cannot but have observed in perusing their Catalogue) there have been many blasphemies and blasphemous speeches ven|ted by Sectaries severall wayes, both by writing, preaching, conference and dis|coursing, and some so horrid and abominable, in such a dispitefull, scoffing, fearfull way, that I tremble to think of them, and shall forbear to name them: And indeed within these four last years in <HI>England</HI> there have been blasphemies uttered of the Scriptures, the Trinity, each person of the Trinity, both of Father, Son and holy Ghost, of Gods eternall election, of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> the Apostles and holy Penmen of Scripture, of Baptisme, Prayer, the ministery of the Word, and the Ministers of all the Reformed Churches, of the Government of the Church, and of the Christian Magistrates: In some books printed and dispersed up and down, there are fearfull blasphemies; as in the <HI>Arraignment of persecution, The Sacred Synodycall Decretall, Martins Eccho</HI> &amp;c. profaning and abusing the holy and dreadfull Name of God in a most fearfull manner, scoffing at the holy Ghost,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Arreignment of Persecu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion,</HI> pag. 93.</NOTE> sent in a Cloak-bagg from <HI>Scotland,</HI> mak|ing a most blasphemous Prayer, wherein the Passion, Death, Resurrection and Ascension of Christ are in a scoffing way alluded unto, with many others which I will not foul paper with transcribing.

The holy Scriptures are by many in these times sleighted and scoffed at (that growes and spreades much) called the golden Calfe, that there are many contradictions and lyes in them, that they are no better then a Ballad, that they can make as good Scriptures; that place in <HI>Genesis,</HI> 6.6. where 'tis said, <HI>God repented that be made man</HI> was untrue; so other places of Scripture. The Doctrine of Gods Eternall Election and Praedestination hath been call'd a dam|nable Errour.

<P>Now having presented the Reader with the Errours and Blasphe|mies; before I come to the Practices of the Sectaries, I will relate some few Passages in the Prayers of the Sectaries, which were vented either in publike Assemblies and Churches, or in their private Church-meetings, all within the compasse of a twelve-moneth, or thereabouts.</P>

Another Independent Minister in his prayer prayed, that the Presbyteri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> might be removed, that Christs Kingdome might be set up.

This last moneth in <HI>December,</HI> one of the Independent Ministers in his prayers at a Lecture, two or three severall Lectures, prayed to God that the Parliament might give libertie to tender consciences. One of the Independent Ministers at his Church-meeting in a house, gave thanks un|to God for the libertie of conscience granted in <HI>America,</HI> and said, Why, Lord not in <HI>England</HI> as well as in <HI>America?</HI> or words to that purpose.

An Independent Minister praying for the Par|liament, prayed that God would keep the Parliament from greeving the Saints, or doing any acts that might make them sad; that they for whom so many prayers and praises had been put up by the Saints, might not now grieve them. <HI>A|pril</HI> 24 the same Independent Minister in his prayer after Sermon, prayed, That now God had delivered us both (namely, the Presbyterian and Inde|pendent) from such bondage and oppression, we might not be guiltie of brin|ging our brethren into bondage, left the Lord carrie us back again into <HI>Egypt</HI> for it. The same prayed on <HI>August</HI> 1, joyning Parliament and Assembly to|gether, That they might do nothing but what the Saints should rejoyce in, and be glad of. About the beginning of <HI>September</HI> last, a Reverend Minister of the Assembly who was an ear-witnesse related it, and said he would acquaint the Commissioners of <HI>Scotland</HI> with it; that an Independent Minister, either in his prayer or Sermon, used words to his effect of the <HI>Scots,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>It vvas upon the great pre|vailing of</HI> Montrosse.</NOTE> That it was just with God to bring this over|throw upon <HI>Scotland,</HI> because of their beating their fellow-servants; and that they could not be content with suffering their bre|thren to enjoy their libertie, but must have a domination.</P>

<P>Now I might in the first place make a Parallel between the practices and waies of out Sect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ries, and the Sectaries of old in the Primitive times (espe|cially the Don<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tist&punc;) as also between them and the Jesuits, them and the Ar|minians, of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> them and the Prelates, and their Court-party, them and the present Malignants; yea, them and some of the bad Emp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rours, as <HI>Iulian,</HI> and could shew such an agreement in their practices and wayes, treading so just in their paths and steps, as if none of them were dead or put down in <HI>England,</HI> only now acted among us under new names, and under o|ther habits and formes, but still the soules and spirits of the Donatists, Jesu|its, Arminians, Prelates, and Court-party were alive, and transformed into many of the Sectaries: And indeed to do this fully would deserve a Tractate by it selfe, which I shall leave to be done by some other more able hand; or else if no other take up such a fruitfull Argument, I may find some opportu|nity hereafter to treat upon it; only before I name the particular Practices of the Sectaries, as I have done their Errours, I will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> some of the more spe|ciall Parllels between the Sectaries, and the Donatists, Jesuits <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>First for the Donatists, and some other Sectaries of the Primitive times, 1.

They agree in their furious outrages and violences against all that oppose their way: Learned men know what Circumcelliones there
<PB N="38" REF="31">
were among the Donatists, and to what a height they came as <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">August. contra Par|men, contra literas Petillian.</NOTE> <HI>Augustine</HI> relates; and among the Secta|ries, there are outragious furious men, and such that in the Churches have committed many insolencies, assaul|ted and abused some Ministers in their own houses, and in other places where they have met them: but I must not enlarge. 3. They agree in their high flatteries of themselves and their party, extolling them and crying them up to the Heavens; the Donatists did <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">leo adorationum impinguere capita,</HI> as <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">August. contra Petilian.</NOTE> <HI>Augustine</HI> speakes; and the Sectaries of our times are incomparable flatterers and admirers of their owne party, have written and spoken such praises and flatteries of their side, as have come almost to blasphemy; these phrases are ordinary, as precious men as any upon earth, men of a most precious anointing, none since the Apostles times like them for gifts and abilities; ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, some have not sticked to say, they were beyond the Apostles, and if Jesus Christ himselfe were on earth he could hardly preach better, that they lead as holy lives as Saints and Angells in Heaven. 4.

In their unwilling|nesse to have their actions or writings examined by anie judicious learned men, but keeping things in the darke. <HI>Epiphanius</HI> resembles Sectaries to a Moule, a feeble creature that doth much hurt by keeping under ground, but it once above ground, then 'tis contemptible and easily taken: Some of the Sectaries have been provoked enough to set down what they would have,
<PB N="39" REF="31">
both by earnest intreaties from beyond seas, and at home, by commands in a kind, by upbraidings for not doing it, and yet to this day they cannot be brought to it;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vide Lit. Guil. Apoll. &amp; Respons.</NOTE> and I judge 'tis for these Reasons: 1. Because they cannot well agree among themselves of any system or body. 2. Because they know not how long they shall be of this mind, nor how much further yet they may go. 3. Because what they set downe may offend manie of their owne party, and loosen all the rest of the sects from them. 4. Because some Grandees, and Persons of note (who are gone further,) will not be well pleased at it. 5 Be|cause when once given under their hands, and that after so long expectation, it will be judged by all rationall men their utmost strength (which if it should have answer upon answer, as no doubt it will) and the weaknesse of it dis|covered and laid bare, they are lost among manie, and will suffer exceeding|ly in the esteem of all intelligent unprejudiced men, whereas now by being silent, they bare the world in hand, as if they had some great matter of strength; manie before they speake and utter themselves are thought to bee wise, and to have much in them, who when they have once spoken, are easi|ly seene thorow. 7. In their quoting Authours for them, who are acknow|ledged for the main to be professedly against them; and in their quoting pie|ces of Authours, and not the whole, leaving the latter part which would ex|plain their meaning; thus the Donatists did <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Lib. 1. de Bapt. contra Donat. lib. 2. de baptist.</NOTE> <HI>Cyprian,</HI> and yet he was much against them as he professes; and so <HI>Augustine</HI> complains of the Donatists, <HI>integrus non allegarunt Scripturas</HI>; thus the Author of <HI>Sions Prerogative Royall,</HI> quotes many Presbyrians for severall things, who professedly were of another way; and one Mr. <HI>E.</HI> (as the Reader may observe in an Extract of one of the prin|ted Letters) quotes the Churches of <HI>France, Scotland,</HI> &amp;c. for the Indepen|dent way, who are knowne to be professedly against it: and so <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Book inti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> The ancient bounds or lib. of Consc.</NOTE> the Author of <HI>The bounds of libertie of Consc.</HI> quotes the <HI>Leydenses</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Title page.</HI></NOTE> Profess. for him, who professedly speak against it, and in <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Synopsis purior.

The Arminians at first broached but small and few errours in comparison, but in some yeares time, came to vent all kind of errors almost, Socinian errors, and what not? so our Sectaries at first were more modest, but within these foure yeares, especially these two last, how they have growne, and what they are fallen into, the fore named Catalogue is sufficient proofe. 3.

The
<PB N="42" REF="33">
Arminians could not be brought to speak out a long while, nor to give what they would have, but hid themselves in doubtfull phrases, and were feared <HI>monstri aliquid alere:</HI> when they stood for and desired a Toleration upon conferences and meetings they were put to it, to give in what they held, and all they held, they were proffered at the conference holden at <HI>Delph</HI> favour and Toleration, if they would give assurance they desired only forbearance in the five Points, but they could not be got to it; so our Sectaries have forborne to this day, notwithstanding all meanes used, to set down this we hold, this we will stick to. 5. The Arminians in those times in the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> in some Cities and Towns where they had power, persecuted the Orthodox, troubled them much; so do our Sectaries in Towns or places where they have power, persecute godly Orthodox men, especially if zealous against the Sects: O how have some Sectaries vexed, plagued and troubled many god|ly Ministers and people severall waies! of which more under their particular policies, &amp; factious practices. 6. The Arminians, had well nigh undone the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> and brought all to confusion, &amp; had not the old Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> been stout and wise, even doing something beyond the ordinarie way of his power; and upon the Synod of <HI>Dort</HI> determining the Magistrate added the civill sanction, and used coercive power, that Countrey had been lost; so Sectaries have by their errours, divisions and factions they have made among us, hazarded all, and if God do not wonderfully put in, and be mercifull to us, their waies and courses will undo us all. 7. The <HI>Netherland</HI> Arminians would be Remonstrants, did write against, complaine of the Synod of <HI>Dort,</HI> that they could not have their liberty, were not well dealt with, could not have so faire a hearing; how many books were written, how many aspersions were cast upon the Synod?

And others preached of the great persecu|tion that was coming; and how the Bishops tyrannie would be nothing to the Presbyterians, their finger would be heavier then the Bishops loynes, or words to that purpose. The Sectaries and the Bishops, with that Court par|ty agree: 1. The Bishops and the Court party would bring off one way or other, by Letters written from great friends at Court, by appearing for them, by removing to some other place the businesse by finding out one de|vice or another, deluding the parties who prosecuted and troubled them, all those of their party that were active and able; who by vertue of the Lawes, conscience, and courage, some men in place were questioned and indange|red, for preaching some Doctrines of Poperie and Arminiansme, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or for some practices not legall, of which many examples were in the former time, fetching them out of the hands of Orthodox men who had power; sending Warrants for discharge of Priests, Jesuites, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and now all <HI>England</HI> o|ver generally, the Sectaries for anie of their partie that are questioned, either for preaching false doctrines, or for speaking unjustifiable words, or for o|ther misdemeanours, do use all waies to bring them off; they will use meanes to remove them from one Committee to another, where they are stronger, they will get Letters writ on their behalfe, they will work things so, as by delayes one way or another the Sectaries shall escape, as much as ever the Jesuits, Priests, Arminians, Innovators did heretofore. 2. The Bishops and Court party would prefer none but their party, kept out all men from all places in Church and Common-wealth, though never so deserving, especially if zealous, or had anie great parts to stand for the truth, and they would pre|fer their own partie though never so unworthy, though little to commend them; and so the Sectaries, in all places where they have power, bring in Se|ctaries though otherwise unfit, into offices and places, though dishonest and scandalous, and set themselves with all the industry and cunning that may be to keep out godly conscientious men that are against the Sects, though the,
<PB N="44" REF="34">
publike suffer never so much for the want of them. 3. The Bishops and Court-party did set themselves to worme out (that being the Archbishops phrase) all godly, zealous, able men out of places, and would by one means or device watching them, cast them out quite, or so hamper and vex them, that they were weary of their lives and places; so doe our Sectaries make it their study, to remove, worme by degrees out of places upon one pretence or o|ther, when they cannot doe it otherwise active Presbyterians, of which we have too manie instances, and set themselves to vex them, by over-rating in Townes where they have place, by bringing them into Haberdashers H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll, by putting in Articles against them which they cannot prove, and so putting them to chargeable journeyes and expences, with abundance of such. 4. The Bishops and the Court-party to bring about their ends, would bring mat|ters to such a condition, and such a necessitie, and then would make those necessities, that condition of affaires, as a ground of such and such following actions, pleading the necessities and the condition of the times as their war|rant; so our Sectaries doe in many cases, they have by their policies and wayes hindred the setling of Church-Government all this while, and they plead the long delay of setling it, as a ground to justifie their gathering Chur|ches, saying, how manie yeares would you have us to stay? when as in the Assembly, Citie, in all places, by all meanes where they have anie interest, they retard the work; and so if meanes be used by Petitioning the Parlia|ment to settle Church-Government, and to suppresse the great errours, then some of the Sectaries say and give out, The Army will be offended, when as many of the Sectaries have used all meanes, and do still, to bring things to that passe, that we might have an Armie under the commands, and in the hands of the Sectaries, though (blessed be God) we have a Noble Ge|nerall free from sectarisme and not above one in six in the Armie that way tainted. 4. The Prelaticall faction and that Court-partie were great Inno|vatours, given to change, running from one opinion to another, being Ar|minians as well as Popish, yea some of them Soci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i|nians, and countenancing such,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>These things I speake not of all the bishops that were, nor of all men that were of that judgement, there be|ing some Orthodox, learned, painfull, pious men, that approved not those wayes, but of the Faction.</HI></NOTE> and were everie day inventing some new matter in worship, adding this ceremonie and the other, putting downe some part of worships, and altering them by substituting other; as in putting down singing of Psalmes in some Churches, and having Hymnes; in putting downe all conceived Prayer, and commanding bidding of Prayer, with a multitude of such like: so our Sectaries are great Innovatours as changeable as the Moon, bringing into their Churches new opinions daily, new practices,
<PB N="45" REF="34">
taking away the old used in all Reformed Churches, and substituting new; taking away of singing of Psalms, and pleading for hymnes of their own ma|king; bringing in anoynting with oyl, bringing in their laying on of hands to give the Holy Ghost, with severall other strange wayes and practices, which the Reader shall find in this following discourse, among the narrations of passages and stories. 5 The Prelaticall faction and that Court-Clergie were daring bold men, that durst venture almost upon any thing, upon counselling to prorogue and break up Parliaments in times of danger and distraction, upon putting men out of offices and places that were not for their turne, and to bring in others calculated for their Meridian, upon corrupting Religion and Lawes at once, breaking in both upon the Truth and the libertie of the Sub|ject at the same time, upon any thing or person that stood in their way: So our Sectaries, many of them are daring men, have attempted and been upon high businesses, about counselling and drawing up Petitions for adjourning (as they call it) the Assembly, in a time when the distractions of this Church are so infinite, and things so unsetled; as also have inserted strange passa|ges into other Petitions, which yet have not been presented, others of the company opposing them; with severall other particulars, which would be too large now to relate; in one word, there is almost nothing which they have not and dare not venture on, that stands in their light, and in the way of their designes; and I may say of many of the Sectaries (for I do not mean all, as I have said before, so I say again, there are some good souls meerly seduced, who are not of the Faction) they have overpassed the deeds of the wicked, not only walked after their wayes, nor done after their abominati|ons, but have corrupted themselves more than they; justified the Bishops and their Faction, by falling into those opinions, and doing those actions in an high, bold, and open way, which that Faction never durst do for feare of the people. Next, the present Malignants and the Sectaries agree in the gene|rall thus, that thorowout the Kingdome, it is now notorious, that the greatest Malignants and Sectaries hold together, and vote together against the Pres|byterians and the Reformation, in all places and upon all businesses, of which there are many examples in the choyce of Burgesses for Parliament, in the Petition presented in <HI>London,</HI> at the choyce of the new Common-Coun|cell, the grandest Malignants and the Independents joyned together to oppose; and in some Committees, where men of both these sorts are, it is observed also: but to come to some particulars; The parallel between the present Ma|lignants and our grand Sectaries, stands in these; 1 The Malignants have op|posed the proceedings of Parliament, by preaching and writing books against them, reviling the Houses, especially the House of Commons, and many
<PB N="46" REF="35">
particular worthy Members by name, speaking against their Ordinances, con|stitutions, as Covenant, Directorie, Ordination, against their Power and Pri|viledges; we know what <HI>Aulicus</HI> that grand Malignant hath done, and how manie books both from <HI>Oxford</HI> and here at <HI>London</HI> hath been by the malig|nant partie printed and vented: so also have manie Sectaries, and here it would fill a great book, to bring into one all the speeches, with the passages in Petitions, Sermons, Prayers, printed books, that have been vented against the Parliament, and particular Worthy Members of both Houses, their Power and Power and Priviledges, with their Ordinances and Orders, in reference to matters of Religion, as the Nationall Covenant, Directorie, Ordinance against mens preaching out of Office, the Monethly Fast, the Or|dinance for Tithes, the Orders and Directions about Classes, and chusing El|ders; in which Sermons, printed Books, Discourses, Petitions, and other carriages of the Sectaries, there have been more things vented distructive to the verie power and nature of Parliaments, undermining the verie root and foundation, and all their proceedings in reference to matters of Religion, yea of justice and civill matters, then ever have been by all the Malignants in <HI>Eng|land</HI> as ever I could heare of; witnesse <HI>Lilburnes</HI> booke, with that lately come forth, call'd <HI>Innocency and Truth justified,</HI> all the printed Letters and Papers that were printed upon occasion of his imprisonment; <HI>Englands Birthright, the Ordinance of Tithes Dismounted, the Arraignment of Persecu|tion,</HI> and all his fellowes, as <HI>Martins Eccho,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Turners Heavenly con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e|rence for Sions Saints,</HI> resembling the <HI>Directory to the golden Calves of</HI> Jero|boam, <HI>and affirming there are untruths, contradictions to the Canonicall Scrip|tures, errours,</HI> &amp;c. And here I dare be bold to say, that here have been grea|ter insolencies and affronts offered to this Parliament by many of the Se|ctaries, then ever was to Parliament in <HI>England</HI> by any men who lived within their power: as for instance, when <HI>Lilburne</HI> was committed to pri|son, and such a Letter was come forth in his name against the Parliament, in such an open vile manner, and at such a time, being prisoner, many of the Sectaries of <HI>Southwark</HI> met together, and propounded to chuse <HI>Lil|burne</HI> Burgesse for Parliament; and that <HI>Lilburne</HI> after so great favour and mercy showne him by the House of Commons, after so high an a|buse of the honourable Speaker, the honourable Committee of Examinations, yea and of the whole House, as discharging him of his imprisonment, without either acknowledging the justice, or petitioning for the mercy of the House of Commons (a favour that I never heard or read of granted to any man before, and that I thought had been a thing impossible, 'even against the fundamen|tall Orders of the House, for a man committed by the House upon far

<P>O what unheard of Ma|lignancies are these I And so Mr. <HI>Iohn Goodwin</HI> in a Ser|mon hath uttered that against the Parliament &amp; the power of it, as opens a gap to all sleighting of their authoritie and power; and I beleeve ne|ver was there any such speech from any before himselfe. 2 The Sectaries and Malig|nants agree in being bitter e|nemies of our brethren of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and of their Ar|mies; the Malignants wee know look upon them with an evill eye, as the first cause of all their miserie, and cannot give them a good word; and all the world sees how the Sectaries hate the <HI>Scots,</HI> raise and spread evill reports upon them, are as thorns in their sides, heavy enemies, ob|structing them in all places where they have power, devising alwaies to be rid of them, and studying what in them lies to make a breach; I could tell the Reader many speeches, stories of the Sectaries in this kinde in reference to our Brethren of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but it needs not, for they that run may read it.

3. They agree in this, rather to have Episcopal Government and a Toleration, then a strict Presbyteriall and thorow Reformation; we all know this would please <HI>Aulicus</HI> and his fellowes, and I thinke I can prove from good hands (and if I should name them, the Sectaries would say so to) that some of the prime Ministers in the way of the Sects have said, That Episcopall Govern|ment and a Toleration of their way would give them content. The Malignants and Sectaries agree in Independency, the Malignants now turn Independents, and professe they are for Independency, and for this I could quote severall speeches, and name some malignant Ministers, and others of note who are for Independency against Presbytery; but this is now so commonly known, that <HI>Britanicus</HI> a man who hath done them many good offices, and cryed up several of them, confesses in one of his Pamphlets about a fortnight since, that the Malignants are turned Independents; hardly a Malignant Priest about town, but is for Independency against Presbyterie. Lastly, The Sectaries agree with <HI>Iulian</HI> the Apostata and some other enemies of Christians in these four things. 1. <HI>Iulian</HI> was a great scoffer at the Scriptures, Christ and Christian Reli|gion, as Eccles. stories mention; and manie of the Sectaries of our time, are fearfull scoffers and mockers at all things that are good, Scriptures, Trinitie, Christ, Ministery, Ordinances, what not? there was never a greater genera|tion of scoffers at Religion then many of the Sectaries of our times, witnesse manie printed books, as <HI>Arraignment of Persecution,</HI> and his fellowes, the <HI>Ordinance of Tithes Dismounted,</HI> besides manie scoffing bookes against the Presbyteriall Government, as the two Brethrens MS. with others of that kinde. 2. <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Theodoret.

<P>And as I have made a Parallel between the Sectaries of our time, and the Donati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts, Jesuits, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> so I might now at large show in all the fore-named particulars an Antithesis and Dissimilitude betweene the godly Orthodox Presbyterians, and the Donatists, Jesuits, Arminians, Prelates, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but I dare not enter into it for feare my book be too voluminous, having already exceeded that proportion which I at first intended when I began it; all I shall do then in point of parallel, is but to hint a few things (which I desire the Reader well to observe) of the difference in the carriage and behaviour these foure yeares last past all along of the Presbyterians both to the Honou|rable Houses, and the Sectaries; and of the Sectaries to the Parliament and the Presbyterians; and for the truth of what I say, I dare appeal to all the world, yea and to the consciences of many sectaries themselves. Though the Presbyterian party from the beginning of the differences between the King and Parliament, among those who professe to stand for Reformation and for the Parliament hath been, and still is (without all compare) the greater part of both Kingdomes, the body of both Assemblies and Ministers, the body of the people in Cities and Countries (especially of persons eminent in place and quality) yea, and the Parliaments too, (of the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> theres no question;) the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> also, after advice had with the Assembly, hath declared for Presbytery, having voted and formed into Orders, Directions, and Ordinances, severall parts and pieces of Presbyteri|all Government; yet for all this have not the Presbyterians taken upon them to set up the Government in that manner and way as they conceive and judge to be most agreeable to the word, drawing in the people with them, but have waited upon the Parliament all this while for the setling of the Church, addressing themselves in most humble manner, by way o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> petitioning, and that both Assembly, Court of Common Councell, Ministers, people; and when sometimes their hopes have been deferred beyond all expectation, and

And as the carriage of the Presbyterian hath been thus in all humble dutie and high respect to the Houses of Parliament, and everie Member in their places (for I have not yet heard of any Presbyterian that hath singled out any one Member by name, to abuse him in print, as some Sectaries have done, both particular Members, and the whole House of Commons) so hath it been with all love, brotherly kindnesse, tendernesse, respect and forbearance to the Sectaries; and considering that the Presbyterians were, as I have shewed before, both of the Ministers and people standing for Reformation, the body of both Kingdomes, having the command and power of the pulpits, so great an interest in the people, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> their love and forbearance to the Secta|ries hath been admirable; when the Independents were but few, and other Sectaries a small number, in the first and second yeare of this Parliament, some halfe a score or dozen Ministers, three or foure hundred people, the Presby|terians gave them the right hand of fellowship, admitted them to their mee|tings,

opened their pulpit doores, unto them, shewed all brotherly respect of love and kindnesse to them, even more then to most of their own way con|descending to such a motion, as to forbeare preaching and printing against their opinions and way, making them (who were so small and inconsi|derable a party) as it were an equall partie, putting them into the balance with themselves; they appeared not to hinder their being chosen to bee generall Lecturers, for this City in severall great Churches: and as at first, so all along they have been tender and respectfull of them in Assembly, City, and in all cases, suffering them to grow up to thousands; and notwith|standing breach of agreements, drawing away their people, preaching against them in their own Pulpits, many high and strange carriages, yet still using all fairenesse and love, hoping by brotherly kindnesse, forbearance and a thorow Reformation in the Church, (wherein they have been willing upon all occasions to gratifie and have respect to their consciences) at last to have gained them. &rindx; O the faithfulnesse, dutifulnesse, patience, long-suffering, forbearance of the Presbyterians; their dutifulnesse, and patience in waiting upon the Parliament; their faithfulnesse in not abating in their zeale and respects to them; O their love, kindnesse and tendernesse to the In|dependents, yea to other Secta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ies also who have had something of Christ and grace in them, and have not fallen into errours and blasphemies, razing the foundation. But now on the other hand the Sectaries (though a contemp|tible number, and not to be named at the same time with the Presbyterians) have not waited upon the Parliament and Assembly for the Reformation, but preached against it, and stirred up the people to imbody themselves, and to joyne in Church fellowship, gathering Churches, setting up Indepen|dent Government, reb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ptizing and dipping many hundreds; and upon any thing that hath been voted by the Assembly, Parliament, that hath crossed them (though alas, few Orders or Ordinances which have refe|rence to the Sectarries, or are against their minds, have little life in them, or are put into execution; witnesse that Ordinance against mens preaching who are not ordained Ministers, witnesse that Ordinance about Printing, <HI>cum multis aliis,</HI> Lay-men never preaching so much, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> so openly as since the Ordinance, and all kind of erroneous wicked books printed, dispersed as much as before, they have put forth books against the Parliament, Assembly, preach|ed against them, and their proceedings, the Directorie, Ordinance against prea|ching of persons not Ordained, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> talked their pleasure, that they would lay down Arms, that the King would give them a Toleration, that these procee|dings would discourage the Army, and such like; they have not forborn prin|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing of Answers to books, Petitions, passages in Letters, or other things which

might make for their cause, because the Parliament did not like them, or had forbid them, there's nothing that may make for the furthering of their way, but they do it, Parliament, Assembly, Citie, Kingdome say what they will to the contrarie. And as their carriage hath been thus to the Parliament, so they have and do all kind of wayes within their power, wrong and abuse the god|ly Orthodox Ministers and people, vilifying, sleighting, and scorning them, raising up all kinds of evill reports, and casting reproaches on them, requi|ting them for all their love and kindnesse, with preaching against them in their owne pulpits, stealing away their people from them, labouring by all means, in places where they have any power or interest, to keep good Ministers out of such Churches, and Presbyterians out of all offices and employments; yea, in many places where they have power, they study and watch to throw out by one wile or other, godly Ministers who are against their way, detaining their dues, vexing of them, and making their lives bitter unto them, domi|neering and abusing the godly Orthodox partie, yea, using all policie and in|dustrie to get themselves into all chiefe places of power and command, that so they may trample upon and crush them. O had the Sectaries been in the place of the Presbyterians, and the Presbyterians in theirs, and they so dealt with by the Presbyterians, as the Presbyterians have been by them, I know what they must have expected from them: I dare appeale to everie ordinarie common understanding, yea, to the conscience of the Sectaries themselves, whether if they had had the Parliaments of both Kingdomes, the Assemblies and Ministers, the Churches and Pulpits, the representative body of this Citie; and the people and wee had been as few as they were in the three first yeares of the Parliament, would they have suffered us to preach in their owne Churches against them and their way, to have from time to time confuted their Doctrine, to have preached up another Govern|ment and way, against what the Parliament had voted and was a setling, to have enjoyed speciall Lectures in principall places, to promote a way con|trarie to theirs, to have drawne away their people and maintenance from them, to have fallen upon the practice of setting up Prebyteriall Churches and Government, Classicall, Synodicall, in Citie, Countrey, to have prin|ted freely against their way, and used all meanes to have rendred them odious among the people, would they have sate still, and gone without places and of|fices of honour, power, profit, and suffered the Presbyterians a small partie, to get into Court, Armies, Committees, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to increase to such a number, such a strength and head, as to possesse most places of command in the field, and in the strongest Garrisons and Forts? as also Civill offices both of power and profit, yea, to have a pluralit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of places and offices?

O no, they would ne|ver have endured the hundredth part of those wrongs, discouragements, injuries; had the Assembly consi|sted of Independents, excepting a matter of eight or nine Presbyterians, would they have endured that, and put up that from the Presbyterian partie, as the Assem|bly hath done from the Independent? suffered them to spin out time so long, to speak those things in the Assembly some of them have; and in stead of bringing in (according to Order) the whole frame of their judgements concerning Church-government in a bo|dy, with their grounds and reasons, to bring in a Remonstrance, casting dirt upon them and their proceedings? Would they in <HI>New-England</HI> endure one or more Presbyterians to live among them, and to go up and downe their Countrey, and in chiefe Towns and places to preach against, cry downe their Churches and Church-government, and to extoll and cry up a contrarie way, as Mr. <HI>Peters</HI> and others do here? For mine owne part I am confidently per|swaded, and so I beleeve are all wise men that have observed the waies of the Sectaries, that if they had been in the place of the Presbyterians, having had their power, number, authoritie, and the Presbyterians had been a small num|ber as they were, and should have offered to have done but the twentieth part of that in preaching, writing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> against them, which the Sectaries have done against the Presbyterians, they would have trod them downe as mire in the street, casting them out with scorn before this time of day, not have suffered a Presbyterian to preach among us, or to have been in any place or office, mili|tarie or civill, but all would have been shut up in prisons, banished, or else hi|ding themselves in holes and corners: many godly persons in some places ha|ving much ado now to hold up their heads, to live by them, to preach quietly, to go safely in the streets, and to be quiet in their houses. And for conclusion of the differerence in the carriage and behaviour of the Presbyterians and the Sectaries, the righteous Lord judge between them, and recompence to the Presbyterians according to their kindnesse, love, peaceablenesse, forbearance and righteousnesse; and the Lord forgive the Sectaries, and turn their hearts, and cause their folly, insolencies, unrighteousnesse, and unjust dealings with their brethren, to be so manifest to themselves and all men, as they may pro|ceed no further.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="39">Now for the particular practices of the Sectaries they are many, and it would require a Tractate by it selfe to set them downe; indeed I hardly know any strange practice that hath reference to their wayes, but some or other of them are guiltie in one kind or another. Most of their practices and wayes may be referred to these ten heads; 1 To loosnesse and libertie in life and con|versation. 2 To covetousnesse, ambition, and self-seeking. 3 To policies and subtiltie. 4 To activenesse, sedulitie and numblenesse in the prosecution of their way. 5 To tumultuousnesse, disorder and confusion. 6 To the disturbance and overthrow of oeconomicall, ecclesiasticall, and pol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ticall relations and go|vernment. 7 To insolencies, pride, and arrogancie. 8 To acts of immodesty and incivilitie. 9 To power and will, carrying all before them, and throwing downe all that stands in their way. 10 To hypocrisie under pretences of pie|tie and holinesse.</P>
<P>Now for the particular practices of the Sectaries, I had drawne up many, to the number of seventie, and provided for everie practice instances for proofe, and upon some of them I could write a large discourse, even a book upon severall of them; as of their behaviour and carriage towards the Par|liament, the Kingdome of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Assembly of Divines, the Citie of <HI>London,</HI> the Ministerie of <HI>England,</HI> yea of all the Reformed Churches, as of their seeking and getting into all sorts of offices and places they are any way capable of (being Sequestratours, Collectours, Receiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rs, Surveyours, Ex|cisers, Customers, Secretaries, Clerks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> getting places in Court, great Townes, dwelling in sequestred houses freely, procuring Arreares, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> not a man almost of late coming into any place or office, but an Independent, or Independentish, there being no kind or sort of preferment, employment, place, but some or other of that way enjoy) as of their plotting and labouring from the first yeare of the wars, to get into their hands the sword and power of Armes, by having a considerable Army, which they might look upon more particularly, as theirs, and of their way, by attempting to remove and heave at many gallant Commanders, to get the command of the strongest Garrisons and places, yea to make Townes of consequence that were no Gar|risons to have been Garrisons, as <HI>Yarmouth</HI>; but I am necessitated for divers reasons, to passe by wholly for the present many of their practices, and others to name only, desiring the Reader as hee goes along, to supply the defect, by calling to mind all particulars he knowes and hath heard of upon the seve|rall heads.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Practice.</HI> They use to ascribe and attribute all the successe of things, all that is done in field, at Leaguers, all victories, brave actions, to their partie, crying them up in Pulpits, News-books, conferences, calling them the saviours
<PB N="55" REF="39">
of the Kingdomes; and for this purpose they have certaine men that are Criers and Trumpetters between the Armie, Citie, and Countrey, who trumpet forth their praises, giving them the titles of Terrible, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> a large book would not containe the relation of all the victories, glorious actions, ex|ploits having been given to the Armie called Independent.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Practice.</HI> They give out and boast their partie to be more and greater than they are; some of them will speak in all places, as if all were theirs, all for them; they have given out, as if Parliament, Armies, Citie of <HI>London,</HI> Countrey, all the godly, wise, judicious understanding men, were theirs, and will be theirs: yea, that the Assembly, the French Churches, the Com|missioners of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> thought well of their way; and so of particular persons that are prime men, they have given out, as if they were, or are coming over to them.

<P N="3">3. <HI>Practice.</HI> They appropriate to themselves the name of the godly and well-affected partie, the title of Saints, calling themselves the Saints, that they only preach Jesus Christ, and though they be Anabaptists, Seekers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet they are the Saints: this is common in printed Books, Petitions, Sermons, Discourses; what, speak against the Saints? be against a Toleration for the Saints? meaning themselves only.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Practice.</HI> They pretend one thing, when they intend quite another, and it is usuall for them to pretend the publike good, the benefit of the State, when it is evident they intend their owne interest, and strengthen of their partie; they pretend peace, love, forbearing of all names of difference, to make the Presbyterians secure, negligent, and to forbeare all means of setling things, and yet at the same time go quite contrarie, using all means and waies for promoting their own partie, as they did after the losse of Leicester.</P>

love, as breaking the peace, and causing mis-rules, tumults as be guilty of persecution, when as 'tis evident to all the world, they are most faulty in these particulars, and in many more, and for the proof of it I Iould demonstrate it in a hundred instances.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Practice.</HI> They do on purpose (having got Churches void) keepe ma|nie Churches without Ministers, seeke out for none, stop (all they can) Or|thodox Ministers from coming in, which they do for two reasons, 1. That so they may pay no Tithes: 2. That so they may have the liberty of the Pulpits for all kinde of Sectaries, and mechanick preachers, who come from <HI>London,</HI> the Armies, and other places to preach in and corrupt the people, and that the people being as sheep without a shepherd, may be more easily now drawne away to error and schisme; and of this practice there are many sad examples in <HI>Hartfordshire, Bucking, Essex,</HI> and that in some great mar|ket-townes, as <HI>Chesham,</HI> where thousands of souls are.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Practice.</HI> They have laboured and do by all waies to have no Church-Government at all setled in this Kingdome, but to keep it out. Or second|ly, if there must be any, yet to have a defective, imperfect loose Government and Reformation, that may not be able to do the worke, that so others may fall off to their way the more; and for proof of this, they have refused to joyn for a pure full Reformation in points according to their own principles, that so one good might not hinder a greater good (as was expressed) and have opposed to the utmost a thorow Presbyteriall Reformation. 3. They have laboured to get a Toleration granted before the Government be setled, to get an exception before the rule was made, and if once they had gotten that, let the Presbyterians get the Government then when they could, and this they stirred in, and sought to effect last winter. 4. Seeing they could not do this, but this policy was espied, they labour for a Toleration together with a Reformation, that the Church-Government and a Toleration might be borne and brought forth together as twins in one day, and so go hand in hand, and this they are labouring for now, the monster of Toleration concei|ved in the wombe of the Sectaries long ago, they having growne big with it ever since, are now in travell to bring it forth, and till they could be ready and get things fitted for a Toleration, they bestirred themselves so against the <HI>London</HI> Petitions, that of <HI>September,</HI> those of <HI>November,</HI> lest Government should be setled before a Toleration, and therefore one of them said to some Citizens, why should you bee so h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sty for Government, cannot you stay a|while? how long said they?

<P N="14">14.

They are full of plots and projects for their way, and increasing their party, they have alwaies designes on foot, they do nothing, nor propound no|thing but theres some designe or other in it, they are big with many at once, that if one take not another may, if one misse they presently start another, of which I could give manie instances, and show how the hand of <HI>Ioah</HI> hath been and is where 'tis little thought; they use other men upon other interests and ends to do their worke, they have waie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> collaterelly and indirectly to effect their worke, when it would be marred if they went <HI>in recta linea</HI>: they can and ordinarily do go about to destroy businesses they seeme to plead for, by pro|pounding and putting upon ways to effect it which they know are not feasible.</P>

<P N="21">21. They take upon them more places then they can or do discharge, and bear the names of some places which they seldome officiate, and have laboured to add more places to those they have already, and that both in City and Countrey, so that some of them besides their places in the Assembly, which they seldom attend (especially this last yeare) and their private gathered Churches, have divers Le|ctures and places, besides their hanging upon great men, to preach before them to ingratiate themselves, and getting to preach at <HI>White-hall,</HI> S. <HI>Iames, Westmin|ster,</HI> and other eminent places, where the great ones, Earles, Lords, and the Grandees of the time resort; they do not, as wee Ministers sit still expecting a call to places, but they are forward men, bestirring themselves to attain this place and that, getting such great mens Letters in their behalfe, using such Ministers of note, and other persons of quality and power in Parishes to make way for them

They take upon them the names of such Lectures and Churches, as being chosen and nominated to them, but others of their own partie supply them, somtimes one, and somtimes ano|ther, they have one Sprig or another, one Emissary or other from the Army, one House-bird or other to serve the places: It would make a book by it self to relate all particulars in this kind. One man of their way, besides being a member of the Assembly and his a private Church, hath places in <HI>Norwich, Yarmouth, Fishstreet|hill</HI> in <HI>London.</HI> A second, besides the Assembly, hath places at <HI>Acton</HI> four Lectures at <HI>Westminster,</HI> besides his interest and share in some Lectures in <HI>London.</HI> A third hath a place at <HI>Stepney, Cripplegate, Cornhill,</HI> besides part of another Le|cture, and all reserves for this Parliament man and the other to ingratiate himself with them. A fourth, besides the Assembly, which he seldom comes to, and his particular private Church, hath Lectures in <HI>London,</HI> which all the last summer he seldome preached at, not preaching at one of them in the space of three quarters of a year together. And they do not only neglect their Lectures in our Churches, but they take to themselves more members in their owne Churches then they can preach or look too, for they admit members who live constantly many miles from them, here one ten miles off, there another five miles, another sixteen miles off,
<PB N="63" REF="43">
some at <HI>Norwich,</HI> some at <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> another forty miles off; every one of their particular Churches is not a Parish Church, but a Bishops Diocesse, nay some of them are Archbishopricks and Provinces, far larger then the Presbyterian Pro|vinces, reaching from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Dover,</HI> as D. <HI>Holms,</HI> who hath severall members there, going twice or thrice a yeare thither to visit; and in one of his visitation Sermons, preaching to his members, prayed God to blesse, and remember them who had but a bit once in a quarter or halfe a year. And as this is the practice of the Clergie, so the Laity among the Sectaries have plurality of offices and places, some have both militarie and civill, others two or three civill offices, and I could name one, who hath some five or six, besid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> his being a Committee-man: In a word, our Sectaries are become Pluralists, Non-residents, and some of them Vbi|quitaries, and are well paid for it, as M. <HI>Peters.</HI></P>
<P N="22">22. They generally walk loosely and at large, over what they did before they turned S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ctaries, and in comparison of the godly Presbyterians; they do many things under pretence of Christian liberty, which professours heretofore were not wont to do, nor do not, neither durst they have done, of which I could give many instances both in persons &amp; things; I do not know, nor hear of a Sectary in <HI>England,</HI> that is so strict and exact in his life, as he was before, and as thousands of Presbyterians are; and this is not my observation alone, but a general observation: many of them play at Cards and Tables, are verie loose on the Sabbath days, go to Bowls and other sports on dayes of publike Thanksgiving, as M. <HI>Iohn Goodwine</HI> and severall of his Church, they wear strange long haire, go in such fine fashiona|ble apparell beyond their places as 'tis a shame; they will feast, ride journeyes, do servile businesses on the Fast daies, and give their Parish Churches no Sermons, no Prayers at all on those daies; they make little conscience of family duties, they will sit and tipple, be joviall and merrie together. I could tell true and certaine stories of manie Sectaries who were exceeding precise and strict before they fell into those waies, but are abominable loose now; and let but a man turne Sectarie now adaies, and within one half year he is so metamorphosed in apparell, hair, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as a man hardly knowes him.</P>
<P N="23">23. In all matters and businesses which succeed not according to their mind, but crosse their waies and designes as if a choice of persons they like not be made to places, or if such a thing passe and be done that pleases them not, they will try all waies possible, and cast about to finde some fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ws or other, pretend this thing and the other to question the election and make it null, or to ob|struct it; they will put in Articles against men chosen, though they cannot prove them; they will pretend somthing or other, was omitted, and such a passage was illegall, and all to bring to a new election, and then they will worke all kind of waies to ef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ect their designes.</P>
<P N="24"><PB N="64" REF="44">24. They have spoken strange and high speeches against the setling of Presby|teriall Government and the Presbyterians, as one Anabaptist of late, That he ho|ped to see Heaven and Earth on fire before Presbyterie should be setled; another Sectarie, That it was one of the Articles of his beleefe, that within seven yeares there would not so much as the name of Presbyterie be heard in England; a third, That hee hoped to see the Presbyterie as much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rod under foot as the Bishops were; a fourth, That if the Saints were thus persecuted, and could not have the libertie of their conscience, it would come to &mdash; A Gentleman told me, he had heard many Souldiers of a Regiment of Horse (which I forbeare naming) say, That when the Army of Cavaliers was overcome, there would be another Army to overcome, intimating the Presbyterians; and I could relate strange speeches told me by faithfull ear-witnesses, no sleight persons, spoken against our brethren of Scotland by some Sectaries.</P>
<P N="25">25. After they have set their hands to papers, as upon agreements in such and such points of difference; as upon the receipts of money, as upon giving in what they desire, when they think such things may make against some of them, have used means to get those papers back again into their hands, and have come to those that kept them some dayes after, pretending they desired to see them, and look upon them for some reasons, and then have desired to borrow them for a few dayes, to compare these papers with theirs, or for some other use, and being lent them by Presbyterians (who are plain honest men, and not acquainted with policies) they keep them, and cannot be entreated to returne them ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ine, but being asked for them, pretend some excuse or other; of which I could give in|stances, naming the persons and things at large, but I spare them.</P>
<P N="26">26. They practise and endeavour to get Sectaries, and those that way affe|cted, to attend on and be about cordiall Presbyterians that are of qualitie, place and power, both to observe and watch them, and to qualifie them, and do some good offices for the Sectaries; of which I could give notable instances, but I must only hint it, and leave Presbyterians to their owne observation.</P>
<P N="27">27. About the time of moulding the new Army, some of the Sectaries gave out where ever they came, and went from one to another, both to Ministers, peo|ple, that such and such (call them what you will) are the men that will fight cordially for you, overcome the Cavaliers, and when they have done, they will either submit to the Government established, or else leave the Land, you need not feare them; and this they laboured to possesse all men with, that so without mut|tering or speaking against, there might the more Sectaries get places in the Ar|my; and yet we see now by experience, that upon all motions and petitions for setling the Government, or against Toleration, the Army is spoken of: And will you discourage those that fight so bravely, and that God hath made so in|strumentall
<PB N="65" REF="44">
to you? and that if they may not have libertie of conscience, and li|bertie to preach, the Army will be discouraged, and if they may not preach they will not fight; and after victories we have been minded by Letters from the Ar|my of libertie of conscience, and expecting no compulsion in matters of the mind.</P>
<P N="28">28. They upbraid in printed books and speeches many Presbyterians, particu|larly of the Assembly, with their former conformitie, yea they brand and asperse them, that they have been great time-servers, Innovators; and this they do to make the people beleeve, that what they do now is not out of conscience, but to serve the times, and that such men are not likely to have the truth revealed to them, nor fit to have a hand in the Reformation, who have so polluted them|selves with corruptions in worship, and the inventions of men; and among ma|ny, good Mr. <HI>Calamy</HI> hath been abominably belied in this kind, especially in that late railing Pamphlet of Mr. <HI>Burtons,</HI> called <HI>Truth still Truth, though shut out of doores,</HI> whereas many of the great Sectaries themselves, and principall Ring-lea|ders in each Sect, as Anabaptists, Antinomians, Independents, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were not only Conformists in the way of old conformitie, but great Innovators and forward Episcopall men, the innovations of Altars, bowing at the name of Jesus, reading the book of Sports, causing the people to come and kneele at the Rail, threatning and bringing their tender conscienced people into the spirituall Courts, yea into the High-Commission being practised by some of them: and I challenge the Se|ctaries to name so many of the Presbyterian partie, who appeare for that Go|vernment by writing, or other wayes, to be so faultie for Innovations, and ser|ving the Bishops, as I can name amongst them. The full Relation of the time-serving and Innovations of <HI>Denn, Cox, Ellis</HI> of <HI>Colchester,</HI> Dr. <HI>Holms, Salt|marsh, Cummins, Wale</HI> of <HI>Norfolk, cum multis aliis,</HI> would make a new book; and the best of the Independents will be found upon search, yea them of the As|sembly, not only for many yeares to have been Conformists, but to have gone further in conformitie to the Bishops than some of us. As for example, Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> in the times of the Bishops pressing Innovations, was wont to ride up and downe the Countrey in a Canonicall Coat, and I ask him Mr. <HI>Bridge</HI> and Mr. <HI>Greenhill,</HI> whether they besides Subscription, took not the oath of Canoni|call obedience, and gave not some monies to the repaire of <HI>Pauls</HI> Church in Lon|don? whereas I, as great a Conformist (as some of the Sectaries would make me to have been) never had a Canonicall Coat, never gave a penny to the buil|ding of <HI>Pauls,</HI> took not the Canonicall Oath, declined Subscription for many yeares before the Parliament (though I practised the old Conformitie) would not give <HI>ne obulum quidem</HI> to the contributions against the Scots, but disswaded other Ministers; much lesse did I yeeld to bow to the Altar, and at the name of Jesus, or administer the Lords Supper at a Table turned Altar-wise, or bring the

<OPENER><SALUTE>Good Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_TIs my lot (so divine Providence is pleased to order it) that in my conflicts for Truth, and a|gainst Error, I should not enter the field and fight single combats, but encounter with many: My <HI>Antapologia</HI> was an Answer unto five men, esteemed Gyants by many of these times; who though they were five to one, yet by the good hand of God that was with mee in that work, I keep the field till this day, nei|ther they nor any for them (notwithstanding all the great threats given out) having yet engaged against mee in that cause. Now in this present booke, consisting partly of a Reply, I have to do with Three, a three-head|ed <HI>Cerberus,</HI> the three-bodied monster <HI>Geryon:</HI> The Apologists were fair smooth men in comparison of these, their voice was the voice of <HI>Ja|cob;</HI> but these are hairy, rough, wilde red men, especially, <HI>Cretensis:</HI> These are grown higher, are gone farther, and are more daring then the former; and yet I doubt not but hee that then brought me off with safety and honour too, will also now stand by mee, and having delivered mee from the lion and the bear, these uncircumcised Philistims, especially <HI>Goliah Goodwin</HI> shall be as one of them. Whilest I was making this Reply, had even finished it, striking off this three-headed Cerberus, new heads of that monstrous Hydra of Sectarism sprung up, which the Reader shall also find have their deaths wound too in this present Book; and yet after all these heads cut off, I expect a great red Dragon having seven heads, and seven horne, and seven crowns upon his heads; but let as ma|ny
<PB REF="47">
Sectaries come forth as will, I shall sing with <HI>David,</HI> Psal. <HI>27.3. Though an Host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear:</HI> And besides my Reply to the Answers made against my Book entituled <HI>Gangraena,</HI> the Reader shall find in this Book more work for the Secta|ries, the Second Part of <HI>Gangraena,</HI> a Discovery of more Errours, Here|sies, Blasphemies, and Proceedings of the Sectaries, wherein I have not only laid down many Errours, Heresies, and Proceedings of the Sectaries not touched before, but some greater, stranger, higher Heresies and Blasphe|mies, and some that are more against the second Table, and destructive to the civill Lawes and peace of Kingdoms, which Sectaries in their plea|ding for Tolerations seem to exempt out of the number of Errours to be tolerated; yea, I desire the Reader to take notice there are some things spoken of in this present Book, some Blasphemies, &amp;c. done by Secta|ries, that the like or worse are not to he found in any age since the com|ing of Christ, nay I think not since the Creation of the world, as that Blas|phemy of one <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag. 162, 163. of this present Book; and that, pag. 8.</HI></NOTE> <HI>John Boggis.</HI> Now that the Reader may the more profit by this work, and not stumble in the Entrance, I shall premise three things whereby to remove a few prejudices that may be in the minds of some men, both a|gainst the matter and manner of this Book.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>1</HI> Tis objected, The bringing upon the stage matters of fact, and the practices of some men against a way, is not a right course to convince a way to be naught, nor the followers of it of their errours: Arguments and Reasons are the way to satisfie men. <HI>Answ.</HI> I have spoken to this obje|ction in the first part of <HI>Gangraena, pag. 76.</HI> and the Reader may find more said to it in this second part, <HI>pag. 79, 80.</HI> And therefore that which I shall say here is this. Such discoveries as these, are a more sensible pra|cticall way of confutation of the Sectaries to the body of the people of the Kingdome, then so many syllogismes and arguments; they can under|stand these when they cannot perceive an argument; and Christ him|selfe, in speaking against false prophets, saith, <HI>By their fruits you shall know them: Doe men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? &amp;c.</HI> And the Apostles in their speaking against the Hereticks and heresies
<PB REF="47">
of their times, confuted them thus by their practices and wayes: Whoso|everdoes but observe the passages in the Epistles of <HI>Peter, Jude, Paul,</HI> shall finde this true.</P>
<P>And whereas tis said by some of them, if they would do so by the Pres|byterians, they could show as many Errours held by some Presbyterians, and as bad practises, &amp;c. and so recriminate. I answer, suppose they could, <HI>1.</HI> Yet there's not the same reason in divers respects; but I will on|ly give one instance, namely this difference: The Anabaptists, Inde|pendents, &amp;c. have their Church way and government up, they are in the practice and possession of it, they may use it, and do to the utmost, to sup|presse Errours, Scandals, in the power of censures, in admitting of none but whom the body allowes, &amp;c. and yet in the free practise of it, and under it, all these Errours grow, and men fall from one thing to another, as all men see; but now those who are in their judgement for Presbyterian Government in this Kingdome, they enjoy it not, have not the benefit of it to censure scandalous persons, suppresse any Errors, or to do any Acts of Government at all, but all lies waste. <HI>2.</HI> I deny that the Sectaries can show men who are Presbyterians (though they want the benefit of the Go|vernment) that fall into those Errours, Blasphemies, Practises which the Sectaries doe, tis a meer flourish, they can show no such thing; nay, I am confident that among all the Presbyterian Ministers and cheife members who have appeared and acted for that way, since Presbyterians, the Sectaries cannot instance in one man like to hundreds and thousands of their Sectaries, either for Errours in judgement, or loosenesse in life.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> Tis objected tis an unchristian way to bring mens names upon the stage, tis to much to speak against a way from the Practises of some of that way, but to name men in print, and publikly to brand them, this is worse. <HI>Ans.</HI> I could give many Answers to justifie this, and show the examples both of Fathers and the holiest, judiciousest moderne Writers who practi|sed this, as <HI>Calvin</HI> in his Tractate against Libertines, naming <HI>Quin|tinus,</HI> &amp;c. and giving reasons there by way of Answer to this very obje|ction of naming men, but I cannot now insist upon it: all I will say is this, for my own part tis much against my genius and temper to do it, for na|turally
<PB REF="48">
I do not love to offend any, or to contend with any man, but to comply and please all; besides, I am sensible of the hatred, reproaches, dan|gers I am liable to for doing it, but a necessi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y is laid upon me to pre|serve the people, and to give them warning to beware of wolves in sheeps clothing; and as I hold my selfe bound in conscience to write Books to discover the errours and opinions of such wayes, so to name the persons of prime notorious Sectaries who are sticklers, (not of all men who are mis-led, or in some lesser matters mistaken) and that from the example of the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> who doth not onely name the errours, wayes, but the men themselves, as <HI>Hymeneus, Philetus, Alexander, Phygellus, Her|mogenes, 1 Tim. 1.19, 20. 2 Tim. 2.17. 2 Tim. 1.14, 15. &amp; 4.14, 15.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><HI>3.</HI> Let no godly person be offended at my Book, if the stile of it be quick and smart, and if I speak sometimes a little sharply to <HI>Cretensis;</HI> but rather let them consider how unworthily (not onely unbecoming a Chri|stian, but a man) hee hath dealt with mee and all Presbyterians in his Answer, discovering such unsufferable pride, arrogancie, scornful|nesse of spirit towards all Presbyterians who fall not down to the golden calves of his opinions of Imputation of faith, Independency, &amp;c. as that there seems no way left to recover him but to deal a little roundly with him, and lay open his folly; besides, the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> speaking of the Cretians, <HI>who are alwayes lyars,</HI> saith, <HI>Where|fore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith.</HI> In one word, <HI>Cretensis</HI> in all his Answers is too like those spoken of in <HI>2 Sam. 23.6.</HI> that must be thrust away as thorns, because they cannot be taken with hands: the man that must touch him had need be fenced with iron and the staffe of a spear: <HI>Cretensis</HI> is a man so foul-mouth'd in all kind of filthy language, that his maid had need seowr his mouth alwayes with a wisp when he goes to write any Book. But to hold the good Reader no longer in the porch, let we earnestly intreat thy prayers to God for his gra|cious assistance, protection, supporting of him who is resolved to <HI>spend and be spent,</HI> and to run all hazzards for the truth of God and his Churches<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a|gainst the errours of the times; <HI>yea, and if he be offered up upon the sa|crifice and service of your faith, he joyes, and will rejoyce.</HI></P>

<P>_ALthough there be already at the Presse a full Reply to the pretended Answers made by Mr. <HI>Saltmarsh,</HI> Mr. <HI>Walwyn,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Iohn Goodwin,</HI> against my late Book entituled <HI>Gangraena</HI>; yea, and some part there|of printed; yet considering not only the three bo|died Monster <HI>Geryon,</HI> and the three headed <HI>Cerberus,</HI> which for present I have to grapple and conflict withall, but that <HI>Hy|dra</HI> also, ready to rise up in their place, therefore that I may both mortally wound the heads of these Dragons, and cut off others as they are springing, and strike once for all in defence of <HI>Gangrena:</HI> my Reply cannot but be somewhat large, and so of necessity must take up more time for the perfecting and publishing of it (especially considering my imployments in frequent constant preaching, be|sides all other occasions) then at this time I am contented to be kept from coming abroad in Print.</P>
<P>And therfore for preventing the Sectaries glorying, and tri|umphing too much in their Answers, and their possessing many peo|ple against my Book, as if it were a Book of lies, and that I could not make proof of, or give a good account to the world of what I have written; as also from interpreting my silence (though but during a time simply necessary to give a full Answer) a repenting of writing my late Book and a retreating from that cause wherein I have so much appeared (as Master <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">A word more to Mr. <HI>Edwards pag.</HI> 1. Sir, untill I perceive the contrary, I cannot but hope that I have prevailed something with you towards a change of your mind, and that you have begun to repent you of the evill you have done by publishing your Book entituled the <HI>Gangraena.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Walwyn</HI> seems to do) I have thought it necessary in the Interim, till my larger Reply can come
<PB REF="49">
forth, to set forth a few sheets to declare my mind to all the world, and to take away all just occasion from men of speaking against my late Book: Now this Book being of the same nature and kind with <HI>Gangraena,</HI> besides a breif Answer to some main Objections made a|gainst it, is not only an Addition of more Errours to the former Cata|logue, a higher Discovery of the wayes and Practises of the Sectaries, a further confirmation of the truth of things contained in <HI>Gangraena,</HI> but an assurance to the Reader of my Resolution and Constancie, by the grace of God, in opposing Errours and Sects maugre all the malice, wrath and power of Hell; as also a satisfaction in part to the most ma|teriall things objected by Master <HI>Saltmarsh,</HI> Mr. <HI>Walwyn,</HI> Mr. <HI>Goodwin,</HI> against my Book; and as I am perswaded this Discourse will not be without its use for the present, so I question not when my full Reply to these three Pamphlets shall come abroad (of which this Book is the fore-runner, and prepares the way) not only all rationall and unpreju|diced men, who shall read and consider, will be satisfied by it; but my Antagonists will be laid so open and bare, as their folly and shame shall be manifested to al men, and themselves and their friends for them will wish a hundred times they had been asleep in their beds when they medled with <HI>Gangraena</HI>; yea <HI>Gangraena,</HI> and this defence of it will prove so incurable a Gangren to them, that they shall never be cured of it by all the Mountebanck quacksalving drugs and tricks of all the Sectaries of this time; and though for a short time confident lying may please and take with many, yet as <HI>Solomon</HI> speaks, <HI>the lip of truth shall be establish|ed for ever, but a lying tongue is but for a moment</HI>; and as <HI>Hierom.

<P N="1">1 THat no Opinion is so dangerous or Hereticall as that of compulsion in things of Religion.</P>
<P N="2">2. That Kingly government among Nations and Common-wealths is un|lawfull, and that for Kings it cannot be said to what use they serve, or that there is any use of them, except to debauch and vexe a people.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is unlawful for Christians to eate any Swines flesh in regard the Devils once entred into the herd of Swine.</P>
<P N="4">4. 'Tis unlawfull to eate any manner of blood in any kind of thing whatso|ever, and that Black-puddings are unhallowed meat, and that the eating of Black-puddings is a barbarous custome.</P>
<P N="5">5. That the Devils never sinned, nor have any sin.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="2" REF="50"><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Saltmarsh</HI> flowing of Christs bloud. pag. 14.</NOTE>6. That <HI>Iudas, Cain,</HI> and all the damned, yea all the Devils shall be saved at last; and that there are no hell torments to eternity.</P>
<P N="7">7. Christ hath repented perfectly, he hath sorrowed for sin perfectly, and he hath repented for us.</P>
<P N="8">8. Faith is not to be the guide of Reason, but Reason the guide of Faith, nor is a man to beleeve any thing in Scripture, further then he sees Reason to induce him</P>
<P N="9">9. That children of beleevers have more then a faederall holinesse, an in|ward reall holinesse.</P>
<P N="10">10. Christs presence in Heaven, or that Christ is present in Heaven, cannot be proved by the Scriptures.</P>
<P N="11">11. Some of the Sectaries do affirm and hold they have not only had Reve|lations, but they have seen Visions also.</P>
<P N="12">12. The means of God revealing himself and his mind and will to his ser|vants in reference to their salvation, is immediatly by himself, without Scri|pture, without Ordinances, Ministers, or any other means.</P>
<P N="13">13. That 'tis unlawfull to give thanks to God after meat received, though it be lawfull to do it before eating of meat.</P>
<P N="14">14. That singing of <HI>Davids</HI> Psalms is blasphemy, and telling of lies.</P>
<P N="15">15. That there is no Justification by Faith, but Faith is only a manifestation of our Justification.</P>
<P N="16">16. That Repentance is a work of the Law, and so not to be performed by Christians; and that Christians have nothing to do at all, but only to sit still, hear and beleeve.</P>
<P N="17">17. Some Sectaries hold they cannot sin, but if they sin, Christ sins in them, he does all, they are acted by him in all.</P>
<P N="18">18. All set times of private prayers as morning and evening, &amp;c. are not only unlawfull and superstitious, but they are not to pray at all, nor give thanks, nor confesse sin, but admire only the Grace of God, that is all they must doe.</P>
<P N="19">19. That hell-fire never had been, if Jesus Christ had not come.</P>
<P N="20">20. That Jesus Christ delivered never a soul from Hell-fire.</P>
<P N="21">21. That all appointed set meetings of many Christians to pray, hear, con|fer, or perform any holy service, whether in a Church way, or out of a Church way, are unwarrantable, and unlawfull, only occasionally if Christians meet in a street, or at a house going to visit friends in civility, they may discourse and talk one with another in points of Religion as they do of other matters.</P>
<P N="22">22. That in the first Conversion of a sinner there ought to be no sorrow
<PB N="3" REF="50">
nor repentance for sinne, God requires none at all.</P>
<P N="23">23. That some Beleevers are as perfect here, as ever they shall be in Hea|ven, only they do not see the Lord here with their bodily eyes.</P>
<P>And for a conclusion of this matter, namely for the enumeration of Additi|onall Errours, I shall adde only this which I received from the mouth of a god|ly Minister, who ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing conversed with some Sectaries that are Souldiers and Troopers, gave me this answer, <HI>March</HI> 13. upon a question propounded by me what strange opinions do they hold.

<P>THere is one <HI>Lawrence Clarkson,</HI> a Seeker, spoken of in my <HI>Gangraena, pag.</HI> 104, and 105. who put forth a Pamphlet called <HI>The Pilgrimage of Saints,</HI> wherein are many passages highly derogatory to the Scriptures, deny|ing them to be the rule of a Christian, or that in Doctrine or Practise half of Gods glory was revealed as yet; this man a Taylor and a Blasphemer preach|ed on the Lords day, <HI>March</HI> eight, at <HI>Bow</HI>-Church in <HI>Cheapside,</HI> in the after|noone: He began his prayer to God, with Right Honourable Lord God, and in his Prayer he prayed that God would blesse the Kings Army, and blesse the Saints both in the Parliaments Army and the Kings, his Sermon was a Rapsody of nonsence. This was not done in a corner, but in a great and full Audience; there was present at this Sermon one Member of the House of Commons, if not more, besides divers other persons of quality; and though this <HI>Clarkson</HI> was in <HI>London</HI> some time after this, and may be still for ought that I know, yet was he never questioned, nor called to any account for this, or for his <HI>Pilgri|mage of Saints,</HI> as ever I could learn.</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>March</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he seventh, a Minister who preached at <HI>Martins</HI> near <HI>White-Hall,</HI> told me, that lately since my Book came forth, he preaching in a Sermon against sin and the Divell, a woman on the morrow came to him (a Nurse-keeper dwelling in <HI>Clare</HI> street) and questioned with him about his Sermon, asking him his grounds for speaking of sin and the Divell, the Minister brought some places of Scripture, shee sleighted the Scriptures, and denied there was any such thing as sin, or Hell, or the Divell, or temptation, or the holy Ghost, or Scriptures; shee said, all the Hell that was, was the darknesse of

the night; she denied that to kill a man, to commit adultery, or steale a mans goods was sin; and the Minister asking her, what do you make your self, shee answered two severall times, <HI>I am that I am</HI>; All this, and a great deal more, was related to me by the Minister, who (as he said) had acqainted an Earle with it and many others; and I spake with one Citizen who heard this Relation from him, and he promised to give it me at large in writing under his hand.</P>
<P>Tuesday <HI>March</HI> 17. on the day that a Committee of Lords and Commons came down to <HI>Guild-Hall</HI> to the Common-Councell concerning their late Pe|tition; many Sectaries from all parts of the City and Suburbs, came to <HI>Guild-Hall,</HI> where, from about four a clock, till about nine, the Sectaries in severall companies and knots in the Hall, 30.40. and more in some companies, vented boldly, and pleaded for all sorts of opinions, the Antinomian opinions, the A|nabaptisticall opinions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> pleading for a generall Toleration of all Sects, yea, some maintained that no immortall spirit could sin, or be capable of sin; and it being objected, what say you to the Divels? they denied the Divels ever sinned or could sin: many other horrid opinions were maintained at the same time, so that 'tis beleeved, that never since <HI>Guild-Hall</HI> was built, there was so much wickednesse and errour broacht and maintained openly in it as at that time. Among many godly orthodox Christians, who were at that time in <HI>Guild-Hall,</HI> and opposed the Sectaries in their pleading thus for all Errours, and a generall Tolleration; there was one godly Citizen who told me this story of himsef, that he reasoning with severall of the Sectaries against their opinions, and a|gainst a Toleration, the next day being the eighteenth of <HI>March,</HI> an Indepen|dent Wollen Draper to whom he had workt almost twenty years, took away his work from him, and said he should have no more work of his, because the night before this Citizen had argued against Independency, saying it was a Schisme; whereupon this Citizen dealt plainly with this Wollen-Draper, and told him, Sir, will you put me by my work, which is my living, for my consci|ence? is not this Persecution? will you have your consciences, and shall not we enjoy ours? would you be tolerated, and will not you tolerate us?</P>
<P>On the ninteenth of <HI>March</HI> a Pamphlet called <HI>The last warning to all the In|bitants of the Citie of London,</HI> came abroad in Print, which Pamphlet speaks a|gainst all Kingly government, receiving the King in again, and against all esta|blished Ecclesiasticall government, besides many other dangerous passages in it: Now this Book was spread abroad and dispersed up and down by Sectaries, as for instance, one <HI>Samuel Fulcher</HI> an Egge-man, rebaptized by one <HI>Crab,</HI> a Felt|maker, was the 21. day of <HI>March</HI> examined before a Justice of Peace for spread|ing this Book call'd <HI>the last warning to London,</HI> and confessed he had sold six or seven of them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">All kind of unlicenced Books, that make any wayes for the Sects, and against Presbyteri|ans, are sold at his shop, and tis given out the man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">els them, but not the Master.</NOTE> One <HI>Overton</HI> an Independent Book-seller

<P>&rindx; There is an Independent Minister who lives in <HI>London</HI> (as I have it from two sufficient witnesses that heard it) said that the Scots coming into <HI>England</HI> would hinder the Reformation of Religion here, and that if he had been in <HI>England</HI> at that time when the Scots came first in, he would have preached to have stird up the people against them, either not to have suffered them to come in, or being come in, to have beat them out. &rindx; The same Minister discoursing and reasoning about the Church way, it was answered to him by a Citizen, that if it were set up in <HI>London,</HI> the Independents could not expect a|bove a twentieth part should be for it, and what should become of all other people? this Independent Minister replied, it was no matter what became of them, though they turned Mahumetans, so the Church of Christ might prosper.</P>
<P>A godly Minister who came out of <HI>Essex,</HI> related to me not long since, that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>An Anabaptisti|call Emissary</HI></NOTE> <HI>Oates</HI> was now preaching in that Country, and had been there about sixe weeks, sometimes keeping his Randevouze at one Town, sometimes at another, sometimes at <HI>Tarling,</HI> sometimes at <HI>Bock|ing,</HI> sometimes at <HI>Braintry,</HI> and other places, and that many loose persons of the Country follow him, he preaching besides his Anabaptisticall opinions, the Arminian points; and this Minister spake it upon his knowledge&punc; that notori|ous Whoremongers and Drunkards follow him, such as have been convicted by witnesses, and taken notice of by the Country, and are such still, yet go af|ter him where he preaches from place to place.</P>

<P><HI>March</HI> 13. Two honest Citizens coming to me about some Sermons an Independent Minister had preached in <HI>London,</HI> one of them told me he lately had a man and maid-servant who were Anabaptists, and that when he was abed they would set up and juncket together, making Sack-possets and such like pro|vision of his purse, and in sum, this male Anabaptist got the female Anabaptist with child, and after married her: The Master speaking to him of breach of Co|venant, how he had covenanted not to marry in the time of his Apprentiship till his years were expired, he said it was a divelish Covenant, and so would not keep it.</P>
<P>On the sixteenth of <HI>March,</HI> a Member of the Assembly of Divines related this following story for a certain truth, which he knew to be so, only would not name the persons; that a Sectary, (one of Master <HI>Goodwins</HI> and Master <HI>Salt|marshes</HI> Saints and beleevers) a Seeker by Sect, sought to gain the good will of a Virgin to be his wife, and when she consented and was contented to it, hee propounded that they might lie together at nigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, at which motion she startled, saying, not till we are married, to which answer this Seeker replyed, that mar|riage was but an idle Ceremony, they were now man and wife before God, having promised one another, whereupon they went to bed together, and next morning after the Seeker had satisfied his lust, he ranne quite away, and left his bride, and instead of one Seeker there were two, the daughter thus forsaken,
<PB N="10" REF="54">
and her mother (who was widdow) to seek after him.</P>
<P>In a Book lately printed, call'd <HI>the Ordinance for Tyths Dismounted,</HI> (which book also was given into the hands of one Parliament man (as I can prove) by a great Sectary who may justly be thought the Author of it) there are such passa|ges of reproach against the Parliament as are not to be paralled in any writings, except some of the Sectaries: In <HI>pag.</HI> 6.7, 8.40. this Sectarie speaking of a pas|sage in the Ordinance of Tyths made by the Lords and Commons, hath these following words, <HI>Had not such a passage gone under the Title of the Lords and Com|mons who are chosen for the weale of the people, I should not have judged it an act of humanity, but rather the result of an Hell-bred conspiracy by the Divell and his Angels to confound us with their unreasonable malice, &amp;c. and this was the first stone these Master-builders laid in their blessed Reformation.</HI></P>
<P>And in another place of the Book, speaking by way of scorne, calling it that <HI>most religious and spirituall Ordinance for the supper, as absolute Ordinances, as un|alterable at the</HI> Directory, these words are brought in, <HI>For indeed at the first on set it was not policy to rush such a diabolicall and villanous invention point blanck upon us, with an It is decreed and ordained by the Lords and Commons assembled in Par|liament. But after a more mysterious manner of ordination, slily intrude it upon us un|awares in the godly and specious vizor of Rules &amp; Directions, as if our Parliament men had such a spirituall and holy eare over us, to give us such wholsom and pious Directi|ons, while indeed under this innocent Apparition in the shape of Lambs they ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> no o|ther then ravening Wolves, rending and tearing us in peeces</HI>; and again, speaking of Parliament men in that Ordinance for <HI>Tyths Dismounted</HI> there are these words, <HI>But what they are, let all the people judge, let them consider whether there can be the least dram of honesty or Religion in them, or respect to the liberty of the free-borne Nation therein, seeing they lay upon us a heavier yoake then ever was laid upon us in the dayes of the Bishop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> And again, this Sectary, the Author of the Ordinance for <HI>Tyths Dismounted,</HI> speaks thus of the Parliaments Ordinance concerning suspending scandalous persons from the Lords Supper. <HI>It will be the greatest thraldome and bondage that ever the Kingdome was involved into, and by this Ordinance of the Sup|per, I am afraid we shall all go supperlesse to bed:</HI> and speaking of the Classes Sy|nods, calling them High Commissions, he addes, if we can finde no justice there, <HI>we may appeal (forsooth)</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Observe here both blasphemy and scoffing of the Parliament in a high manner.</NOTE> <HI>to our Gods themselves, the Par|liament (life everlasting, world without end) of whom, how may we expect mercy or justice then, that thus before hand whip us with the stings of Scorpions, and grind us between the devouring jawes of such develish tyrannicall Courts which will even crush our bones in peeces, and squeese out our very marrow and juyce, and suck out our very hearts blood like so many greedy Cannibals</HI>?

<P>MY Lord Major hearing of a great concourse of people that were to meet upon such a businesse, having a respect to the peace and good govern|ment of this City, sent two of the Marshals men to <HI>Lam</HI> to the <HI>Spitle,</HI> where they were met to dispute, but had not yet begun, who told <HI>Lam</HI> that may Lord Major had sent them to him to forbid him or them to dispute as upon this day; <HI>Lam</HI> answered the Officers he would go up and acquaint the brethren, which he did, standing in a place like a desk above the people at one end of the room, and <HI>Battee</HI> at the other: The first thing that <HI>Lam</HI> spake of, was, that my Lord Major had sent to forbid their meeting, or rather to desire them not to dispute as upon this day; <HI>Battee</HI> stood up and said that Mr. Major was a limb of Anti|christ, and that he was a persecutor of the brethren, and that he did question what power or authority he had to forbid them; he was sure the Parliament gave him no such power, but gave them liberty to use their consciences, and for his part he durst undertake to make it good to Master Major (calling my Lord Major in a most base and scornfull manner Master Major.) One <HI>Overton</HI> that was to be the Moderatour on <HI>Battees</HI> side, stood up and said, Brother <HI>Lam,</HI> had <HI>Paul</HI> done well if he had desisted from preaching in the name of Jesus if he had been commanded by the High-Priests to forbear, had he done well or not? <HI>Lam</HI> answered no; whereupon <HI>Overton</HI> replied in a most scornfull proud man|ner,
<PB N="15" REF="56">
nor ought we to obey Master Major; and thus did these men argue the power of my Lord Major for an houres space; but at the last they came to state the question, and fall to their dispute; the question was, That God made man, and every part of man of the dust of the earth; and therefore man, and every part of man must returne to the dust again, which <HI>Battee</HI> could not prove, nor could <HI>Lam</HI> well tell how to answer, but both of them ran off from Scripture to Scripture, never clearing any one thing to the people; and when they had rambled a long time, that they could neither of them tell what to say, then one or other stood up, and said, Brother <HI>Lam,</HI> or Brother <HI>Battee,</HI> leave this point to the consideration of the Brethren, and take up some other; after these two had spent foure or five houres in this confusion, they sat down and rested, and then stands up one <HI>Mellish</HI> a Cobler, and <HI>Lawson</HI> a Schoolmaster, both Anabaptists, and to work they went as their Brethren before: <HI>Lawson</HI> calls to <HI>Mellish,</HI> and saith to him, Brother <HI>Mellish,</HI> speak either Categorically or Hypothetically; <HI>Mellish</HI> answered <HI>Lawson,</HI> that he spake now to him in an unknown tongue, and prayed him to explain himself; <HI>Lawson</HI> told <HI>Mellish</HI> that he was nor fit to dis|pute if he knew not the meaning of these words; <HI>Mellish</HI> replied that if hee should stand up and tell the people that the Moon was made of green Cheese, he did not question but some would be of his mind.</P>
<P>This Relation was given me under the hand of a godly honest Citizen, who was an eare and eye witnesse of all the said passages, who also named to me other persons that were present, and he delivered me this Relation in writing before two sufficient witnesses, and declared himself ready to make proof of this before Authority when ever he should be called.</P>

<P>I Desire you pardon my boldnesse in imparting to you that which hath lately befaln me: I was in the company of some Antinomians that were very im|portunate with me to forsake your teaching, and come among them and harken to their Preachers, and they prevailed with me so farre, that I gave them my promise to hear their Preachers; but the night following, I had such a terrible dream which made me break my promise with them; for I dreamed that the Divell would have pulled me out of the bed, and carried me away with him; then I cried out in my sleep so loud, that I waked them that were in the Cham|ber, Lord Jesus help me, Lord Jesus help me; then me thought the power of God came on my right hand, and rescued me from Satan: This I take for a warning
<PB N="16" REF="57">
from God to avoid their society; and for which I desire that thanks be ren|dred to God in this Congregation which I use to frequent.</P>
<P>There is one M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ster <HI>Mills</HI> a Common Councell man, the City Brickler, who hath related it to many, as a thing most certain, that an old acquaintance and friend of his, an old Papist knowing well all Papists, said to Master <HI>Mills,</HI> that now there were but two Sects or sides in <HI>England,</HI> the Presbyterians and the Independents; unto which Master <HI>Mills</HI> objected, how can that be? seeing there are many Papists; this Papist replied, that to his knowledge all the Pa|pists in &rindx; <HI>England</HI> were Independents; and this Papist further added, that this Liberty of Conscience and Toleration for all men to enjoy their Religion, was a blessed thing, and the happiest thing that ever was found out, or words to that purpose.</P>
<P>There is a Sectary living neer the <HI>Spitle,</HI> a great follower of Master <HI>Randall,</HI> who did offer to sell his Bible, and being asked why he would sell it, and what he would do for a Bible, answered, he could make as good a Book himself. Some Sectaries do commonly affirme they are not to beleeve the Scriptures further then their own Reason doth perswade them of the truth of them, and that the Scriptures are no more the Word of God then the words any man speaks are; because he could not speak those words but by a power from God.</P>
<P>It hath been told me from good hands, that there are a company of persons about <HI>London,</HI> who meet weekly to reason and object against the Scriptures; their meetings were about the <HI>Spitle,</HI> and since in <HI>Hounsditch,</HI> and now they shift places for feare they should be discovered, and surprised; it were good that Authority would look into it, to finde them out; I shall be ready to name the men from whom I have had such information.</P>
<P>I have been informed lately by divers honest men, that in <HI>Northampton</HI>-shire some of the Souldiers who are Sectaries, and are of that part of the Army which came out of the West, and belong to that Army in the West, have come into the Parish Churches, and put by the godly Ministers who should preach, and by force against the will of the Ministers and people, have set up Cap|taines, and others of the Souldiers to preach in their Pulpits, and to vent their Fancles and Errours.</P>

This, one <HI>Redgwell</HI> an honest man making re|port of, was asked if he were not at <HI>Oates</HI> his Exercise; he answered no; then it was demanded, was not your wife there? He answered, if he should deny that, he should sin against God, and tell a lie, for she (he said) was there, but was never well since. This Bearer can likewise tell you somewhat of Master <HI>Archer</HI> of <HI>Halsted.</HI> Also of one <HI>Lancester</HI> of <HI>Bury</HI> a Pedler, and of his opening the whole Book of <HI>Ezra</HI> at a private meeting, insteed of opening his pack, and of the pray|er that followed his Exercise, &amp;c.

<P>Upon conference with the Minister who brought up this Letter, he related these following passages to me, and I writ them presently as he spake them.</P>
<P>Master <HI>Erbury</HI> (one of those Sectaries spoken of at large in <HI>Gangraena,</HI> pag. 109. and 110.) coming lately to <HI>Bury</HI> in <HI>Suffolk,</HI> and there exercising in private, he delivered divers erroneous things, and at last went so high, as to deny that Jesus Christ &rindx; was God, and that he was as much God as ever Jesus Christ was, or should be.</P>
<P>One <HI>Lancester</HI> in a private meeting at <HI>Bury,</HI> condemned all the Ministers of <HI>England</HI> for the <HI>Sanba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ats</HI> and <HI>Tobiahs</HI> of this time, that hindered the building of the Temple, resembling himself, and the Sectaries to those who would build the Temple, but it was withstood by the Ministers, who hindred it: At that meeting there was a plain godly man, a solid old Christian of Master <HI>Faircloths</HI> congregation who opposed him, and God was so mightily with him, that it

turned to the shame and reproach of this <HI>Lancester,</HI> and those who adhered to him.</P>
<P>Master <HI>Archer</HI> of <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lsteed,</HI> an Independent, a man who hath preached much against our Ministers and Tyths; at the same time, or thereabouts, when hee preached so against Tyths, used meanes to procure to himself a great Living in <HI>Essex,</HI> of two hundred pounds <HI>per annum,</HI> and came to some Gentlemen of the Country for their hands to further the getting of that Living.</P>

<P>_I Shall take them in order, and begin with Mr <HI>Saltmarsh,</HI> who first apeared in Print: As for Master <HI>Saltmarsh</HI> he doth not so much as offer to disprove any one peece of matter of fact throughout my whole Book, excepting that only of a woman Preacher at <HI>Brasteed</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> of which he affirmes that 'tis known to all in that place to be a meer untruth <HI>Vid.

<PB N="20" REF="59">
to say till my full and particular Reply to Mr <HI>Saltmarsh</HI> and his fellowes shall come forth) that as tis a strange bold assertion to affirm not only for himself, but for all the Parish, that they know 'tis a meer untruth (which implies thus much, that Mr <HI>Saltmarsh</HI> does not only assuredly know all things that all the women in the Parish do, but all what ever the whole Town of <HI>Brasteed</HI> knowes; for else how can he say so of all the women, and all the inhabitants of that place) so tis an untrue assertion? for some who live at <HI>Brasteed</HI> do not know it to be an untruth, but beleeve it to be a truth; for one Mr. <HI>Wheatly</HI> a godly able Minister who lives at <HI>Brasteed</HI> in a Gentlemans house, and hath lived there this two years, told me very confidently this Relation of a woman in the presence of two Ministers; besides two other Inhabitants of the Town who have lived longer in <HI>Brasteed</HI> then Master <HI>Saltmarsh,</HI> affirme the same; and three godly Ministers living neer to <HI>Brasteed,</HI> have told me also there is such a woman, of whom this is commonly spoken; and a Citizen in <HI>London</HI> an honest man having some re|lation to <HI>Brasteed,</HI> and knowing the place, tels me there is such a woman, as is reported by many of <HI>Brasteed</HI> to be a preaching woman; and he coming lately out of <HI>Kent,</HI> told me that upon the way meeting with a Gentleman of the Committee, who discoursing of Mr <HI>Saltmarshes</HI> denying there was any such woman in <HI>Brasteed,</HI> and was speaking against my Book, this Citizen replyed, he beleeved it to be true, and offered to lay a twenty shilling peece that there was such a woman, but the Gentleman durst not; and besides all this the Mi|nister who first told me, having lately been written unto about it, in a Letter by way of answer stands to that Relation which is laid down in <HI>Gangraena.</HI> But of this in my full and particular <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Of the name of the woman, her meetings, with other particulars <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ent this matter.</NOTE> Reply the Reader shall receive more large satisfaction; only for present from what I have now said (though there be much more behinde) I leave to the consideration of any judicious and unprejudiced Reader whether I had not ground enough to writ as I did, and whether there be not more reason to beleeve so many affirmative witnesses then one negative, who may not know all thats done in <HI>Brasteed</HI>; (for such a thing may be, and he never the wiser) besides Master <HI>Saltmarsh</HI> being a Sectary is a party, and his testimony is by me proved to be false, in affirming all in that place know it to be a meer untruth, whereas the contrary is the truth, divers living in that Town relating the story of a woman Preacher there.</P>

<P>Now by way of Reply, first concerning Mr <HI>Walwyn</HI> himself, I am confident that every judicious Reader, who hath but read Mr <HI>Walwyns</HI> Pamphlets, out of them will acquit me, that I have said nothing of him but truth, he being out of his owne mouth and writings condemned for <HI>a dangerous man, a Seeker, and a strong head,</HI> as many who knew him not before, from reading his Pamphlets, have told me, that he hath justified to the world what I have said of him; but I shall at large make good this against the man in my full Reply to him and his fel|lowes, following him from place to place, from person to person with whom he hath conversed, and from one thing to another that he hath had his hand in; wherein I shall lay him open to the world, and prove him to be a dangerous man, yea a desperate dangerous man, a Seeker and Libertine, a man of al Religi|ons, pleading for all; and yet what Religion he is of no man can tel; A man of an equivocating Jesuitical spirit, being full of mental reservations, &amp; equivications as appears by the sense he hath put upon the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">A word more to Master <HI>Edwards.</HI></NOTE> Nationall Cove|nant; there being hardly any Jesuit could have put a more equiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|call interpretation upon the Covenant, then himself: And I desire the Reader to observe what I now say of M. <HI>Walwyn</HI>: Since his first Book came forth against me, I have enquired and spoken with many honest godly men about M. <HI>Walwyn,</HI> who know him well; and all of them with one consent and voyce (though I have enquired of them apart, concerning him, and the men know not one ano|ther) yet all agree that Mr <HI>Walwyn</HI> is a dangerous man, and a desperate man.

<P><HI>Inprimis,</HI> That Mr <HI>Walwyn</HI> did say it was a sin to pray for the King&punc; and that it would lie as a sin upon the Preists so to delude the people; and that he did admire at our Preists that they should stand bauling and praying for the King, that God would turn his heart, and say of him that he was the anoynted of God. And he said they were glad to doe it (namely the Ministers) because if the King maintain them in their way, they would cry him up to the people:
And M. <HI>Walwyn</HI> being asked how we should performe the Covenant we had taken to maintain the Kings honour, he
said he remembred no such
<PB N="22" REF="60">
clause in the Covenant: And further he said, that he did much admire at the simplicity that was in the hearts of the people, that they should suffer them|selves to be Governed by a King, and that under such a government the King|dome could not be safe: He being asked what he thought of Mr <HI>Marshall,</HI> M. <HI>Calamy,</HI> M. <HI>Sedgwick,</HI> and other godly Ministers; he answered and said they were a company of Mountebancks, and that they kept the people in igno|rance and blindnesse, and that they preached nothing but what we know al|ready, and that he knew no Scriptures for them to be Preachers more then o|ther men, as he named Shoemakers, Coblers, Weavers, or Sopeboylers, and the like; absolutely speaking against all Congregations and Ministers, and that if their Tyths were taken from them, they would soon leave their trade; and said that the Apostles were tradesmen, and were not chargeable to the bre|thren; He further said that our Ministers might go and preach the Gospel to the Turks and Heathens, and not to stand prating here, for as he said before, we knew enough already.
I asked him who should preach to the people, and how they should be maintained, if they would have them have nothing?
he answered he knew no Ministers that ought to be maintained, but that every man that had gifts might be a Minister, and use the liberty of his Conscience; and he spake in the behalf of <HI>Paul Best</HI> for his Blasphemy; saying, that if we could not convince his Conscience, we ought not to punish his body. Touching the Rebellion in &rindx;<HI>Ireland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Observe to what this pretended liberty of Conscience brings men, namely, to plead for Treason, Re|bellion, and all kind of wick|ednesse.</NOTE> M. <HI>Walwyn</HI> said, the Irish did no more but what we would have done our selves, if it had been our case; and said, What had the English to do in their Kingdome? and that they were a better na|tured people then we, and said, why should not they enjoy the liberty of their Consciences? I told him that it was a sad thing to see how we are divi|ded, some women would not pray with their husbands, and some not sit at ta|ble when they gave thanks for the creatures; and servants would not joyne in prayers with their Masters, nor heare them repeat the Sermons, and that many of them have cast off all duties in their families; he justified them all in what they did, and said, they could give a Reason for it, and that it was their Conscience that led them to it, and therefore they ought not to be blamed.</P>

<P>The second was told me <HI>March</HI> 29. by a Common-Councell-man of the City of <HI>London,</HI> a godly understanding and active man, who related to me both the place where it was spoken, and the names of some other Citizens, who were present, and heard it as well as himself, and the Relation is as followes.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="60">
<Q>There being a meeting at a Tavern of some wel-affected Citizens to consi|der of some things in reference to the publick, as they were sitting by the fire (before they began to fall on the businesse they met for) M. <HI>Walwyn</HI> spake of the Trinity in such a strange manner, and so slightly, that all the company was troubled at it, and they brake off and departed without doing any thing of that they came for.</Q></P>
<P>Now M. <HI>Walwyn,</HI> I dare appeal to any indifferent Reader, whether I have injured you in giving barely a brief note or touch upon you, saying, M. <HI>Walwyn, a dangerous man and a Seeker</HI>; or rather whether I did not much befriend you to say so little of you, when as you deserved I should have made a long relation of you and your wayes, as well as of <HI>Hich, Web, Clarkson, Wrighter,</HI> and many others.

I suppose that beside his pride, and the show|ing of his parts, it was to engratiate and endear himself to all the Sectaries, by appearing and writing against a man so hatefull to them as M. <HI>Edwards</HI> is, and specially at this time, writing <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">That's the main subject of both his Pam|phlets: <HI>A Whisper in the ear,</HI> and, <HI>A word more to Mr.</HI> Edwards.</NOTE> once and again for the cause of Liberty of Conscience, that so being taken notice of for <HI>a strong head,</HI> and true to the generall libertie of all Sects; some or other of the Independents might get him a Burgess place, and bring him in to be a Member of the House of Com|mons: I am of the opinion he aimed at that, knowing that <HI>Cornwell</HI> was clear|ing, and many places there wanted Burgesses; and do beleeve, if a man could see the List of those who are prickt for <HI>Cornwell</HI> by the Independent party, hee would find M. <HI>Walwyns</HI> name in; and I am of the mind, if M. <HI>Peters</HI> were asked, and would tell truly, it would be found M. <HI>Walwyn</HI> and Lieut. Col. <HI>Lilburn</HI> are committed to his care for <HI>Cornwwell,</HI> and that he must preach at their election; and besides all other reasons I have to think so, this is one, that both M. <HI>Walwyn</HI> and M. <HI>Lilburn</HI> were by some named, and voices laboured to be made for them to have had them Burgesses of <HI>Southwark</HI>; I have spoken with two godly men of the Burrow, who were once or twice at a meeting about the businesse of M. <HI>Walwyns</HI> being propounded for a Burgesse in <HI>Southwarke,</HI> who then opposed it, as hearing from many hands, that he was <HI>a dangerous man, and a Seeker,</HI> yea worse. As for M. <HI>Walwyn</HI> saying my informations of M. <HI>Lilburn</HI> to his know|ledge are such as if they had been made of purpose to shame mee to all the world: I reply, had hee instanced in any one particular, I would have given a particular satistactory answer: But it may be M. <HI>Walwyn</HI> means that which <HI>Cretensis</HI> particularizes in <HI>pag.</HI> 48. of playing at Cards, that 'tis false that M. <HI>Lil|burn</HI> is a player at Cards, and that hee protests <HI>hee never plaid a game at Cards

</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>A Narrative of certaine words uttered by <HI>Mr.</HI> Iohn Goodwin Minister of Coleman-street, not long before the Assembly sate.</HEAD>
<P><Q>THe said Mr <HI>Goodwins</HI> judgement being consulted as concerning the point of Church-government: His Answer was to this effect, that in his judgement he approved of the Presbyterian government as being most agree|able to the Word of God, yet in fine added that he thought, that the way of In|pendency would better suit and fit him in regard of some private and singular Tenents that he held&punc;</Q></P>
<P>This Minister subscribes his name at length under these foregoing lines, and writes as followes.</P>
<P><Q>Master <HI>Edwards</HI> let me request you not to bring my name upon the Stage in Print to attest this businesse for divers reasons best known to my self:
I say no more, <HI>Verbum sat sapienti.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Yours in all offices of love.</HI></P>
<P>And therefore though in this, as in any other particulars, I set not down the names in Print, yet am I far from forgery or lying, or those Ministers from be|ing afraid to justifie their Letters, as <HI>Cretensis</HI> would insinuate to the Reader; <HI>pag.</HI> 6.7. But I conceive the Reasons why this Minister and many others, though they are willing to witnesse truth, and to communicate their Intelligence about the Sectaries, yet for the present do desire to have their names concealed. 1. Be|cause they live among many Sectaries and Independents, some whereof being in place both in Towns and Countries may do them no good offices, but may much molest and trouble them; and therefore unlesse some great good might come by witnessing publikely, which might countervaile their hazard, as sup|pressing &rindx; the Conventicles of the Sectaries, the spreading of erroneous opi|ninons, and punishing some of the Rabbies and Ring-leaders, they are unwill|ing to venture themselves by being brought upon the Stage in Print. 2. Be|cause some live in places where part of our Armies lie, or may come: Now ma|ny souldiers being Sectaries, and violent for their opinions, if they should meet with any Ministers named in print, giving me intelligence, it were as much as the spoiling of them and their families; and where are they that do or will se|cure them from such violence? there are too many examples of Ministers be|ing
<PB N="27" REF="62">
in danger, as M. <HI>Andrews</HI> was; and therfore I deal plainly, I have been spoken to by word of mouth, and sent unto from some Ministers in the Country not to name them in my Books, because, if the Army, or some parts of it come that way, they shall be undone, which is a satisfying answer to all rationall men, for my concealing their names, especially to all those who understand the state of things, and observe how powerfull the faction of the Sectaries is.</P>

<P><HI>Obs.</HI> 2. M. <HI>Cretensis</HI> Answer in the whole frame, drift, and in all the strains of it is so carried (if not formally yet virtually and equivalently) to justifie and defend all the Heresies, Blasphemies, Practises I have spoken against; for what one of all the 180. Errours or Blasphemies is spoken against, disavowed or con|demned in <HI>Cretensis</HI> Answer, but rather all along throughout the Pamphlet, the Errours, Heresies, &amp;c. are slighted, made nothing of, put off with jears, scoffs, and great swelling words of vanity; yea, in a sort denied, as if there were none such, and in fine, both <HI>Cretensis</HI> Conscience and wanton wit are prostituted and stretched upon tenter-hooks to finde evasions and tricks to bring off without losse all sorts of Sectaries and opinions; as for instance, <HI>Cretensis</HI> palliats and daubes with untempered morter, the Errours, Heresies, Blasphemies, &amp;c. with such kind of devices as these following:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cretensis,</HI> pag. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> <HI>That he could make a Discovery of as many Errours and Heresies together in me alone, and that the most Or|thodox Presbyterian under Heaven (no nor Independent neither) errours not much be|neath the like rate or number of errours and mistakes of Religion, that he marvails how M.</HI> Edwards <HI>could stay his pen at so small a number as</HI> 180. <HI>and did not advance to ten thousand times ten thousand, &amp;c. that if I will own the verdict of as learned and in|geneous a pen as ever wrot on my side,</HI> (Cretens. pag. 9.) <HI>I must release the better half of the prisoners, and instead of</HI> 180. <HI>Errours and Heresies write down four score, and that for twenty</HI> (Cretens. pag. 11.) <HI>and ten of those opinions which I have impeached of
<PB N="29" REF="63">
Errours and Heresie (and he will not say for how many more) he casts the glove to whoso|ever will take it up to bring them off with the honour of truth</HI>; besides <HI>Cretensis</HI> makes a sixfold deduction from the Catalogue of Errours and Heresies, (<HI>Cretens. pag.</HI> 9.) and pleades formerly, and <HI>in terminis</HI> for some of the Errours; lastly also he so minces and extenuats the whole contents of my book, (<HI>Cretens.</HI> p. 11. p. 20.21) <HI>That when all the accused ones shall have time and opportunity to stand forth, and plead their innocency,</HI> (Cretens. pag. 6.) <HI>there will be very little truth found remaining in any thing reported by</HI> me, <HI>except in such things as are transgressions against no Law</HI>; and indeed the whole Answer is in one kind or other a continued pleading for <HI>Baal,</HI> and a calling Error Truth, and Darknesse Light.

And tho this be very sad that such a man as <HI>Cretens.</HI> who pretends to so much Saintship and holynesse should do thus, or indeed any man who hath but the name of a Christian, yet I cannot but observe a good hand of God in this as well as in the former, thus to leave him as to shame him before all the world, many besides my self taking notice and speaking of this in <HI>Cretens.</HI> how without all distinction he speaks for, &amp; most shamefully excuses all kind of Errors, Here|sies, Blasphemies, Antitrinitarians, Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ians, Antiscripturists, &amp;c. not finding any one Error or person throughout my book worthy to be blamed; but in this we find no strange thing, for that Scripture must be fulfilled, <HI>As for such as turn aside unto their crooked wayes, the Lord shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity.</HI></P>

Is not this a strange and new way of an|swering Books, for men to take up things upon trust from others, to go by an implicite faith, and not to see with their own eyes, nor examine things them|selves, especially for a man upon things observed by others, to make such a mighty businesse and to carry matters in such a scornfull triumphing way posi|tively charging a Book with lying forgery, &amp;c. as <HI>Cretensis</HI> doth? what if <HI>Cre|tensis</HI> Saints, who observed and presented matters to him, (being parties) should out of weaknesse, in judiciousnesse, or partiall affection, if not malice and wil|fulnesse mistake and pervert my sayings, where is <HI>Cretensis</HI> then?

many, the Books being extant to prove them, and most of my witnesses will be found to be godly able Ministers, and other eminent, sound, substantial Christians, and the worst of them of more repute, more likely to know things they reported then the best of yours (excepting Mr. <HI>Burroughs,</HI> whom yet I shall prove to have forgot himself in writing that Paper set down by you <HI>Page</HI> 42.) beside, the persons whom I had relations from, had no reason to speak things out of partiality, prejudice, but only the naked truth, many things being related to others as well as to me; besides, few of them who writ or related these matters, did them out of any design against the Sectaries, but only in a way of declaring, and bewailing to what passe things were come; and if to all these be added what <HI>Cretensis</HI> himself grants, <HI>page</HI> 26. one affir|mative testimony is more valid in Law, then many negative, all that Mr. <HI>Good|win</HI> hath alleaged by way of Answer is to little purpose.</P>
<P><HI>Observ.</HI> 11. That those very things <HI>Cretensis</HI> charges me with either in my <HI>Antapology,</HI> or <HI>Gangraena</HI> (though most unjustly) as forgery, lying, jugling, bitternesse, malice, bloody negotiation against the Saints, taking up reports, and printing them upon weak and slight grounds, obscene scurrilous writing, contradictions, false English, nonsense, with such like; the man himself, as in other of his Books, so also in this, is most faulty, as the judicious Reader may observe more or lesse in one of these kindes or other throughout the whole Book, and in my full Reply I shall more largely and particularly specifie: In one word, <HI>Cretensis</HI> is a most ungodly, Antichristian, insolent, proud, mali|cious, wrathful, lying, obscent&punc; scurrilous, nonsense, absurd, contradictory piece.</P>

<PB N="36" REF="67">
malice against the Saints and faithful Servants of God, calling for fire and sword against the Saints?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 'Tis a Book full of truth, as will appear in the Replyes I give to the particular exceptions made against it, and have in part cleared already, and a Book of so much truth, that I believe no Book written this hundred years, having so much variety and particularity in it, will be found to have more; and for the proof of the truth, and reality of the Errors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> contained in it, I have expressed my self at large (as foreseeing the Sectaries would call it a Book of Lyes) in my <HI>Gangraena,</HI> pag. 5, 6, 7, 8. and as 'tis not a Book of Lyes, so neither of bitternesse, nor of speaking evil of the Saints, but a Book free from railing, evil speaking, against the Saints and Servants of God, which at large in twelve several particulars in my full Reply coming after this Book I shew: But no judicious Christian need wonder at it that the Sectaries gene|rally give out so, for they have nothing else left to say for themselves, and to help their desperate cause, so much discovered and wounded as 'tis by <HI>Gan|graena</HI>; and what do they do in this case, but as the Jesuits and Papists did by Mr. <HI>Foxes</HI> Book of Martyrs, give out it was a Book of Lyes, and writ Books to disprove some matters of fact, taking advantage from some mistakes in cir|cumstances about names, places and such like, to cry it down; and yet all the Protestants know it was full of truths, and is of precious esteem in the Church of God. Just so do the Sectaries now by my Book; and many of them, that they might possesse the people the more against it, and make that imputation, <HI>That&punc; 'tis full of Lyes,</HI> gain credit with the people, have invented many Lyes and Stories, which they formally tell up and down the City and Countrey for certain (and I can produce several witnesses to prove this, namely Mini|sters and others, who have come to me and to others to know the truth of them) as that some of the Independent Ministers have been with me, Mr. <HI>G.</HI> Mr. <HI>B.</HI> and have convinced me of some Lyes in my Book, as that same of the Souldiers out of the Army, have been with me about the story of Mr. <HI>An|drews,</HI> and proved it false to me, as that one whom I name in my Book and speak of, as having some relation from the mans own mouth, coming to me about it, I confessed I knew him not, nor never saw him before, with some other such; all which are meer lyes and fictions of the Sectaries, (so wicked and cunning are they in their generation to uphold their tottering <HI>Babel</HI>) to prejudice Christians from reading and considering my Book. But good Reader, however falshood and slandering of men, is pretended the great cause of speaking so against me and my Book; the true cause of all the hatred is, because there is so much truth in it: Many men who answer nothing to it, and others who have appeared in writing to disprove the truth, know them|selves and others too guilty, and that in other passages where they are not
<PB N="37" REF="67">
named, and know that I know and can prove it, and that vexes them to the heart; but were it indeed (as many of them against their consciences give out) a Book of Lyes, they would not be so mad at it, but I should before this time a day by some of my good Friends the Sectaries have heard of them after another manner, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> another place then yet I have done: But in a word, I apprehend these three following Reasons, as principal causes both in <HI>Cre|tensis</HI> and others, of their appearing against me in so much wrath, fury and rage.</P>
<P N="1">1. A Vial is poured out upon the Sun, the glory of their prime men is dark|ned, both by the <HI>Antapology</HI> and <HI>Gangraena,</HI> they who made themselves as the Sun in the Firmament of the Church, are found, by these Books, not only to be as the Moon full of spots, subject to like weaknesse as other men, but to be in the Ecclipse, fuller of blots then others; yea, their Sun is turned into darknesse, and their Moon in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o blood, and they who would have been thought to have been the only Saints, nay Angels dropt from Heaven with new Gospel, new Light, and new Revelations, do evidently appear (by what I have writ|ten) to all men who have not sacrificed the principles of their ingenuity upon the gainful service of the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">That is proverbially cal|led the thriving side and way, Offices, Moneys, Honors, Lands, great places attending upon them&punc;</NOTE> Independent Faction, to be strange kinde of Saints, if Saints. The best of them appear to be spots in the profession of Religion; but for many among them, who yet are cried up to the Heavens, <HI>they have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.</HI> Now they being men proud, high-minded, impatient of any check and contradiction in their way, who thought alone to have had the repute among the people for sanctity, holinesse, and to have been Idolized by them, and the contrary being so clearly demonstrated by many particular instances and proofs given in my Books, no wonder that they are so mad, and rage against me, and finding their Kingdom full of dark|nesse, that they gnaw their tongues for pain.</P>
<P N="2">2. By my Books, especially <HI>Gangraena,</HI> many Sectaries being so discovered by name, and places of abode, laid open in several of their opinions and ways, will not be able for the future to do so much hurt and mischief among the people; their Sheeps skins are by this pull'd over the Wolves ears, and many will now shun and be afraid of them, who before knew them not; and this disappointment of infecting and corrupting others, vexes and mads them to the heart.</P>
<P N="3">3. Their way and design must needs suffer much by this last Book in the esteem of all the Churches, and all the godly persons who are unprejudiced, yea, and of all fair ingenuous men, who before (many at least not knowing
<PB N="38" REF="68">
the depths of Satan) might think well of them; whereas now many of them upon reading my Book, have lifted up their hands and blest themselves, to think what kinde of Creatures these Sectaries are, saying, <HI>If Independents and Anabaptists be such kinde of men, do such things as this Book shews, God keep us from being such; we had some good opinion of their way, but if they be such Merchants, and have such tricks and wayes as Mr.</HI> Edwards <HI>layes down, we will be none of them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cretensis</HI> design, next unto that of rendring my Book and all I relate in it to be false and untrue, is this; The aspersing me and my <HI>Antapology</HI> and <HI>Gan|graena</HI> with such weaknesse and want of all learning, as if I understood neither Latin nor English, nor knew not how to speak or write Reason, common sense, or to frame the structure of a period according the common Rules of Grammar, but were a profound Ignoramus, and so altogether unfit to take upon me the confutation of Errors; and this he insists upon in several Pages of his Pamphlet or Answer. <HI>Cretens.</HI> p. 10, 23, 24, 36.</P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> Now in this, what doth <HI>Cretensis</HI> else but play the Jesuit and Ar|minian, in stead of solid Answers, thus to flight, vilifie me and my Books, that being just the way they took against such Books as were too hard for them, and knew not how to Answer, as Dr. <HI>Twiss's</HI> Books against Arminians, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but whatsoever <HI>Cretensis</HI> in his rage casts upon me and my Writings, my Books will speak for me and themselves in the gates; having the testimony of many learned and godly men both of this and other Churches, at home, and beyond the Seas; and could I without blushing and all suspition of prais|ing my self, relate the passages in Letters, messages sent me, speeches by word of mouth from great Divines, both at home and from abroad, concerning my <HI>Antapology</HI> and <HI>Gangraena,</HI> and that not only of particular men apart, but of many in a body both in City and Countrey, as a common joynt act, besides expressions that have faln from some Independents, and Independentis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> con|cerning me, my studies in the Controversies of the Church way, and some of my Books (as a speech of Mr. <HI>Thomas Goodwin</HI> spoken to a Minister one Mr. <HI>T.</HI> and others then present upon occasion of some Independents slighting me, and my first Book, as <HI>Cretensis</HI> doth here; yea, passages out of some of Mr. <HI>Iohn Goodwins</HI> Answers to Mr. <HI>Prynne,</HI> concerning me and my <HI>Antapology</HI>) it would be a full confutation of all <HI>Cretensis</HI> hath said against me in this mat|ter; yea, a clear conviction that all words of this kinde, are nothing else but the venting of his spleen and passion against me and my Books: But all I will say by way of Answer to <HI>Cretensis</HI> reproaches of this nature, is, 1. The quick sale these Books had, being bought up by learned and judicious men of all ranks, the last Book <HI>Gangraena</HI> being now in the Presse the third time within lesse then two Moneths, unto which adding the greatnesse of the

<P><HI>Cretens. pag.</HI> 2. labours by all his Rhetorick and many words to insinuate to the Reader, how in writing of my Book <HI>Gangraena,</HI> I have said all, and the worst I can of the Independents and Sectaries, &amp; that whilst I charge them <HI>only with such and such crimes,</HI> I do not <HI>so much charge</HI> them with these, <HI>as acquit and discharge</HI> them <HI>from all others, and that there's no reasonable man but will abate and deduct, and that to a good proportion from such reckonings and accounts, &amp;c. much lesse will he judge such accounts short or defective in parti|culars; and that Mr.</HI> Edwards <HI>hath but faintly informed the world how vile and bad the Sectaries are, but hath justified and acquitted them from all other crimes and imputations of any worse resentment or import then those wherewith he afflicted them, and consequently hath represented them to the world, as better and far more deserving, then far the greatest part of his own Presbyterian Gene|ration.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> However, Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> or the Printer for him, may possibly in some places of his Book print none of the truest English, yet I am sure <HI>Cre|tensis</HI> in this Page speaks none of the best sense nor Reason that ever I read in my life, but every line and sentence is so slight and weak, that a man may look through and through it; and the truth of it is, <HI>Cretensis</HI> all along hath a multitude of bom-basted, starched words, priding himself therein, but sel|dom or never in all his answers hath he any thing else; witnesse his Answers to Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> Mr. <HI>Prynne,</HI> and this present Passage: And first for that which <HI>Cretensis</HI> speaks here, the man makes good what he saith <HI>pag.</HI> 50. that he never read one quarter of my Book, and that he took things upon trust, as observed by others; for certainly had he read my Book over, he could never have writ thus, that in charging the Sectaries with these, <HI>I acquit them from all others crimes and imputations, and that I have represented them to the world, a better and far more deserving generation, then the far greatest part of the Presbyterians.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Because in divers pages of <HI>Gangraena</HI> I expresly declare I have many more to lay to their charge, stiling this Book but a praeludium and preparative to what's behinde; doth a man who accuses a guilty person at first but with two or three Articles, and yet formally declares he hath many more, and upon every Article pleads his liberty and power of Additionals, justifie and acquit him from all others?</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="41" REF="69">2. Had <HI>Cretensis</HI> but read over my Book, and considered what Errors&punc; Practises, Blasphemies I speak of, to what a nature some of them amount, and of what a kinde they are, that there can hardly be worse, he would never have said I had dealt but faintly with the Sectaries, <HI>and that the Sectaries were a better and far more deserving generation then the Presbyterians</HI>; for if the far greatest part of Presbyterians be worse (or so bad) either for Doctrines, Practises, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as I have proved many of the Sectaries to be, then I must pro|fesse I will disclaim, and be the first that shall c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y out of them, and will never go about to plead for them as <HI>Cretensis</HI> does for his Sectaries. But supposing I had not declared my minde in this case, yet all that <HI>Cretensis</HI> saith is in con|sequent without all strength of reason; for therebe and are reserves when not thought of, and wise men always in all matters of accusations and reckonings will fear there's more behinde, and suspect somthing worse, though not de|clared at first; and I would ask <HI>Cretensis,</HI> whether either in impeachments, or reckonings and accounts brought in to Courts of Justice against such and such men, though at first but part of the Accusation be alleaged, whether the accused can be secure, they are justified with an high hand from all other crimes and imputations of any worse resentment or import; and when one is impleaded and endicted upon the la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ter, this be a good plea in Law, to say he is free, because they were not mentioned at first; much lesse then will it hold in cases where there was a formal Declaration and caution entred, that such Articles were but a preparatory and not the whole matter.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Cretensis pag.</HI> 3. makes two Challenges, casting his Glove the first and se|cond time to me; first as to matter of Practise, look of what crimes or mis|carriages soever I have with any truth impeached the Sectaries, he will produce both as many for number, foul (yea far more foul) for nature per|petrated and done by a far lesse number of Presbyterians; yea and that he will give another manner of account of the reality and truth of what he brings upon the Stage in this kinde. Secondly, for matter of opinion, that he will discover and finde out as many Errors and Heresies, and those of every whit as dangerous an Import, to be at this day in a far lesse number of the Classique party; yea that he could make a discovery of as many Errors and Heresies in me alone; and that he doth not think the most Orthodox Pres|byterian under heaven, nor Independent neither, erres much beneath the like number of Errors.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> I accept these Challenges, and do take up the Glove both the first and second time, rechallenging and defying <HI>Cretensis</HI> to make them good; and by these ungodly Challenges made by him out of his great care and love of Errors, to strengthen the hands of Hereticks, least they should suffer losse, were he <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Gaunt,</HI> and his Glove <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Gaunts</HI> Gantlet, I
<PB N="42" REF="70">
would take it up, And first of all Reply to <HI>Cretensis,</HI> the man speaks he knows not what. <HI>Cretensis</HI> not having read one quarter of my Book, as him|self professes, knows not what crimes or miscarriages, Heresies and Blasphe|mies, with the way of making them good, I charge the Sectaries with: and yet he will at random, and blindefold undertake to finde as many in a far lesse number of my Classique Proselytes and party. O what will not this man say, so it may make for the Independent party: Surely he will startle at nothing who dares speak thus: Can you produce as many Blasphemies a|gainst Christ, the Scriptures, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and finde as many horrid Opinions in Presbyterians as I have proved to be in Sectaries? where will you finde a|mong the Presbyterians, such as <HI>Hich, Wrighter, Web, Clarkson, Marshal, Ni|chols, Den, Oats, Cretens. cum multis aliis</HI>; As for the condition <HI>Cretens.</HI> pro|pounds, upon which he will make good his undertaking, and out at which he hopes to escape, to salve his lying, I do for my own part accept it, and am rea|dy freely and candidly to declare my minde and judgement in all points of Religion, and shall perswade others also to do the like: But of this more in my full Reply, where I shall shew the fallacy and shift of <HI>Cretensis</HI> in this; only for the present the Reader may observe he puts in these conditions, that so he may provide a Sanctuary for all kinde of Hereticks and erroneous persons, a a place of retreat for himself one way or other to come off these Challenges, which in the plain open field he foresaw he could never do.</P>
<P><HI>Cretensis page</HI> 6. among other his Artifices and devices to weaken the cre|dit of the truth of those matters laid down in <HI>Gangraena</HI> against the Secta|rian party, labors to possesse the Reader,
<Q>That for saving of my own re|pute, and to prevent, as much as might be, the thorough examination of the greatest part of what <HI>Gangraena</HI> represents by way of disparagement to the Independent party, I printed so many Letters without the names of their Authors;</Q> and upon this <HI>Cretensis</HI> goes on vaporing and forging in his He|retical brain, certain Reasons of my concealing the names of the Authors of the Letters, and in sum, would render me to the Reader, a man to be suspected of jugling and forgery, and the Letters to be void of all truth.</P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> As for that fallacy of <HI>Cretensis,</HI> whereby he labors to delude the Reader, infinuating that the Letters contain the greatest part of what <HI>Gan|graena</HI> represents by way of disparagement to the Independent party, and those Letters being without names, the names were concealed on purpose for fear of examination of the truth of the Letters, and so the Letters containing the greatest part of disparagement against the Sectaries, the Sectaries are as it were at once cleared from what <HI>Gangraena</HI> faith against them; I say only this. That <HI>Cretensis</HI> is a man of that impudence and large conscience, that he will say any thing, so it may make for the Sectaries, and against the Presbyteri|ans;
<PB N="43" REF="70">
for the Letters are not neither in number of sheets the tenth part of <HI>Gangraena,</HI> neither contain they the tenth part of the Discovery of the Er|rors, Heresies, Practises, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> beside, some things in the Letters are of ano|ther nature, and to one of the Letters is annexed a Confutation of the mat|ter contained in it, consisting of two whole leaves of those few sheets, with|in a few lines.</P>
<P N="2">2. As for that of jugling and forgery which <HI>Cretensis</HI> would put upon me, the man measures me by himself and his party, because that he and some of his party are used to juggle and possibly forge Letters and News, invent and give our many things which never were; have with the Jesuits their <HI>piae fraudes</HI> to advance their Catholike cause, therefore he thinks so of me; but I blesse God I am a plain man, hating equivocations, mental reservations, plots, underminings of men, playing under-board, carrying things in the clouds; I count honesty the best policy, and faithful plain dealing the greatest wisdom, and the Independents will finde it so in the end, however for a while they prosper by their shufling tricks, devices, policies, as <HI>Strafford, Canterbury,</HI> and others did before them.</P>
<P N="3">3. To come to the main charge of concealing the names of those who writ me Letters, and all the inferences drawn from thence: I answer, I have al|ready given some Reasons for it, and do adde these unto them; most of the men who writ the Letters, writ them not for that end to be printed, knew not of, nor imagined no such matter, neither did I acquaint them with it, and for me without their leave obtained to print their Names to the world, I could not do it, keeping unviolated the rules of friendship, besides I well un|derstood that were a way to cut off correspondency and Intelligence for the future, if I should print mens Names publikely to the world, writing in a pri|vate way to me: Of all the Letters written to me, there were two only which I expressed to the Authors I would print them, and acquainted them with my purpose, whose Names notwithstanding (excepting the two first Letters sub|scribed) I concealed with the rest for company: But now that I may over|throw <HI>Cretensis</HI> Proposition, and his Inferences, his Foundation, and his Su|perstructures, I shall name most of them who writ the Letters to me and o|thers, as also from whose hands I received those Letters which were printed by me, though not written to me. The first Letter was written me from Mr. <HI>Strong,</HI> a Member of the Assembly of Divines, who after he had told me by word of mouth the contents of this Letter, promised to send it me in a Let|ter, and I acquainted him then what use it was for, and he said he would justifie what he writ, and named others in whose presence Master <HI>Denne</HI> main|tained these Points. The second Letter was written from Master <HI>Simon Ford,</HI> to a Member of the Assembly Master <HI>Gower<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</HI> from whose hands I
<PB N="44" REF="71">
received it, and told Mr. <HI>Gowers</HI> I should print it, to which he was willing, and since <HI>Gangraena</HI> was printed, the Author writes to me about his Letter,
<Q>That he will enlarge and confirm the particulars in that Letter, and send it to me.</Q>
The third Letter was one Master <HI>Josiab Ricrasts,</HI> who owns it, and hath been with me since <HI>Cretensis</HI> came forth, and to my knowledge is drawing up an Answer to <HI>Cretensis,</HI> for so much as concerns that Letter. The fourth Letter was written by a Weaver in <HI>Somersetshire,</HI> one <HI>Crab</HI> (if I mistake, not the name) and I received it from M. <HI>Rosewal</HI> a City Minister well known, who will own it, and make it good 'tis such a mans: And thus I have given an account of the Copies of all the whole Letters printed by me: Now for the Extract of certain Letters written to me &amp; some other Ministers, for seven of them, which are the greatest part of those Extracted Letters, namely all those which con|cern <HI>Colchester</HI> and Mr. <HI>Ellis,</HI> or some others there (of which Letters Mr. <HI>Ellis</HI> himself writes thus to a friend in <HI>London; The aspersions cast on me, and some others here by Mr.</HI> Edwards, <HI>are as false as foul; which because they are a great part of his Book and strength, those who are here concerned in it, will, if God please, shortly make Reply, Cretensis</HI> p. 44.) he who writ them is not afraid of his name, neither was his name concealed for fear of an Examination of the truth of the Letters, as <HI>Cretensis</HI> by reading this Letter lately sent to me from him may understand, which I here print to a tittle.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THere is a passage in Mr. <HI>Iohn Goodwins</HI> Book, charging you with abu|sing Mr. <HI>Ellis</HI> of <HI>Colchester,</HI> and the Saints in those parts, and that he will shortly make Reply to your false and foul aspersions. These are therefore to certifie you, that concerning those Letters I writ unto you from <HI>Colchester,</HI> I have them attested under the hands of many sufficient witnesses, each parti|cular that is material being ayerred by three witnesses at least, and those of piety and judgement; which attestations I shall keep by me to produce them upon fit occasions to iustifie those Letters to the world. Yet it is possible he will Reply to those things as false and foul, or come off with distinctions and mental reservations; but these things are so evident in this Town, and much more then I writ unto you (as his Preaching for the pulling down of our Churches, and other things that I can prove) that his Pamphlet will do him

no good in this place. For it will not be the first time that he hath said &amp; unsaid the same things here, denying and dissembling his opinions for advantage, as will be testified by many witnesses, by some of the Honorable Members of the House of Commons, Ministers, and others, godly and judicious Christi|ans: This I thought good to signifie for the present, recommending you to the grace of God, I rest</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Now by all this the Reader may see what to judge of <HI>Cretensis,</HI> and his false glosses and commentaries upon the Letters Printed in <HI>Gangraena</HI>; and had I <HI>Cretensis</HI> railing scoffing Rhetorick which he makes use of in this section, and in many other places of his Book, I might spin out whole leaves in aggravati|on and scoring up of lyes, evil surmisings, bitter words scoff, and jeers expres|sed by <HI>Cretensis</HI> upon occasion of the Printed Letters; but I forbear to con|tend with him in this kind; truth needs not such colors, though errors does to set it off. The hare relation of these things is a sufficient confutation of <HI>Cre|tonsis</HI>; and if the printed Letters of which <HI>Cretensis,</HI> Master <HI>Ellis,</HI> yea and Ma|ster <HI>Saltmars<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> make such a cry of forgerie, falsitie, dare abide the light, and their Authors are ready to justifie them, the judicious Reader by this may both judge of the truth of other things contained in <HI>Gangraena,</HI> and of the folly and vanity of the rest of <HI>Cretensis</HI> allegations against my Book.</P>
<P>As for the extract of four or five Letters, whose Authors names I have not yet mentioned, ther's no one particular matter of fact, or relation of stories except|ed against any of them; the other Letters whose Authors I have named, are the foul offensive Letters, and therefore I shall spare their names till the truth of the facts related in them be questioned by <HI>Cretensis</HI> in a Rejoynder: only for present I assert, I have the original Letters by me under the hands of the Ministers to produce, and further I make no question, if the evils spoken a|gainst in those Letters might be remedied, and the proof censured according the nature of their offences, but the Ministers who writ them would be ready to come up and own them in the sight of the sun, and prove a great deal more then they have written. And for a conclusion of my Reply to this eight Sect. of <HI>Cretensis,</HI> had <HI>Cretensis</HI> and his followers but a little Presbyterian faith (which Sectaries so scoff at) and ingenuity, out of all the particulars which I have nakedly and clearly laid down, they would believe that all the Letters from first to last were neither forged, nor names conceal'd, for fear of the exami|nation of the truth, nor because my name should be the greater, and rise better by being only known, but be ashamed of all that's written in this Section, e|specially considering Master <HI>Edwards</HI> hath brought all the names of the Wri|ters,
<PB N="46" REF="72">
challenged from out of the land of darknesse, into the land of light, and given such reason (a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he hath) for the former concealing of them.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Cretensis</HI> page II. makes two challenges, casting the Glove to whosoever will take it up; and his first challenge is, that for thirty of those opinions im|peached in my Catalogue of error a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d heresie (and he will not say for how many more) he will undertake to bring them off with the honor of truth. Secondly, for that error, <HI>viz. That Faith in a proper sense is imputed to Justi|fication, and not Christs Righteousnesse</HI>; he challenges all the Presbyterians one after another, assembled, or not assembled in <HI>England, Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ire|land</HI> to prove by Scriptures, or by dint of Argument either, <HI>That Faith is not imputed in a proper sense.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> The man from challenging me, page third, rises in his confi|dence to challenge all the world (as if the man had learning and parts to deal with any man under heaven) but <HI>Cretensis</HI> needed not to have gone so far, I shall finde him near hand those who will deal with him without going in|to <HI>France, Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI>; for the first of these, I take up his Glove a|gain, and give him his liberty to name twenty and ten of those opinions, and as many more of them as he will, and do promise to enter into the Lift with him, that he shall not prove them to be truths, and I expect he should make good his challenge out of hand, at least to set out in his Rejoynder to my Reply, which of the 180. Errors he will take the Tutoridge and Patronage of;
<Q>And for the second, Master <HI>Roborough</HI> (whom <HI>Cretensis</HI> scoffs at <HI>pag.</HI> 26. by the name of <HI>Servant</HI> and <HI>Clerk</HI>) takes up his Glove, and desire me in my Reply to signifie thus much unto him: For that jeer of Master <HI>Robor.</HI> holding his peace when Master <HI>Gataker</HI> hath spoken, his playing on servant and Master, Justice of Peace and Clerk, Master <HI>Robor.</HI> passeth it by as he hath much bad language from him in his Vindication of Master <HI>Walker</HI>; only he faith such gibing and jeering cost him nought; Its said it runs in the blood, that he had it by tradition, from which is seems he is not yet redeemed for all his sin|gular profession; Master <HI>Roborough</HI> will not deal with him in that for shoe|buckles, <HI>Cretensis</HI> shall have the preheminence; yet doth he modestly desire an Answer to his <HI>Animadversions</HI> on M. <HI>Goodwins</HI> Book, and is ready to make his writing good, against <HI>Cretensis</HI> and his complices in further writing, or by a dispute when and where <HI>Cretensis</HI> pleaseth. This the man professeth who is meant in that jeer, the <HI>Servant</HI> or <HI>Clerk</HI> that must hold his peace.</Q></P>
<P>And as M. <HI>Roborough</HI> gave me the precedent words in writing, under his hand; so he added by word of mouth, that he challenges <HI>Cretensis</HI> to dispute this point, about <HI>Faith being imputed in a proper sense,</HI> where, when, before whom, and how he will, leaving him to nominate his own time, place, com|pany, manner of dispute, either by writing or by word of mouth; by Scri|ptures
<PB N="47" REF="72">
or by dint of argument, in all which <HI>Cretensis</HI> having this liberty, and so the advantage of him; yet M. <HI>Roborough</HI> will meet with him and dispute it as <HI>Cretensis</HI> hath stated the question, and that before all the Independents <HI>Assem|bled or not Assembled</HI>; and Master <HI>Roborough</HI> much wonders <HI>Cretensis</HI> should thus vapor, and in this point challenge all the Presbyterians one after another <HI>Assembled or not Assembled in England, Scotland, France and Ireland,</HI> when as Master <HI>Roborough,</HI> who is but a Scribe of that Assembly, (of which <HI>Cretensis</HI> would fain have been a Member, &amp; as 'tis thought by wise men, his great pride working upon discontent in m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ssing of that honor, was one of the greatest ce|casions of his falling to Independency) professes that upon a conference &amp; dis|pute with him, he found him weak, not able to hold his ground, and in a word, a very sorry Disputant; and Master <HI>Roborough</HI> offers in that Controversie a|bout the <HI>Imputation of Faith to Justification,</HI> wherein <HI>Cretensis boasts</HI> he is so versed as to challenge all men, (it <HI>Cretensis</HI> dare give him a meeting) to mani|fest as much to all the world in the sight of the Sun; and for a conclusion of my Reply to these two Bravadoes of <HI>Cretensis,</HI> I desire the Reader to observe what an impudent Braggadocio this man is, to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ke new challenges, when as yet he hath not yet accepted of old, but lies miserably wounded both by his own pen, and several others, not having yet answered several Books written against him, nor a Book he promised above 12 moneth ago to answer, and there|fore my advise to <HI>Cretensis</HI> is, first to answer these following Books, <HI>viz.</HI> that of a Quaere upon the Covenant, and a Letter from <HI>I. G.</HI> to <HI>T. G.</HI> Master <HI>Ro|boroughs</HI> Book of Justification written against him, Master <HI>Lanes</HI> a yong Mer|chant against that Error of <HI>Natural men may do such things as whereunto God hath by way of promise annexed grace and acceptation, &amp;c.</HI> Dr. <HI>Stewart</HI> against <HI>M. S.</HI> this Reply to <HI>Cretensis,</HI> and a larger Reply already in the Presse against <HI>Cretensis</HI> and my <HI>Antapologie,</HI> and after he hath answered all these from point to point, as becomes a Scholar with reason and words of sobernesse, and not with rail<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gs, Scoffs, sixe footed words, then to make his new challenges, and defend 30. Errors, and as many more as he will (laid down in my Cata|logue) and among others, for old acquaintance sake, that of <HI>Imputation of Faith.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cretensis page</HI> 15. promises an Answer to the <HI>Antapologie</HI> shall be with me ere long; and that he may abuse me, he abuses the Scripture, playing upon that of <HI>Amos</HI> 5.18. resembling his Answer to my <HI>Antapologie</HI> to the day of the Lord, the judgement of the 70. yeers captivity, me to the sons of <HI>Belial</HI>; his foretelling long ago of an Answer, as to the Prophets predictions of judge|ment, &amp; that the Answer to M. <HI>Edwards Antapol.</HI> will not be for his honor, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> Belike I shall have a terrible thundring Answer from <HI>Cretensis,</HI> when as it shall be to me as the day of the sore judgement of the 70. years captivity to the sons of <HI>Belial,</HI> who derided the predictions of the Prophets, a
<PB N="48" REF="73">
day of darknesse, and not of light: I know not well what the man means by this, whether he intend not (concluding by that time his Answer comes a|broad to my <HI>Antapologie</HI> the Cavaliers will be quite subdued) to try by his interest if he cannot procure some part of the Army call'd by <HI>Cre|tensis</HI> and his Disciples, <HI>the Saints, the honest men, &amp;c.</HI> to carry me into capti|vity, and to imprison me all my time in a Dungeon, where I shall not see the Son, nor be able to make no Replies, nor never write against the Sectaries any more; this I confesse were like to prove as bad to me as the 70. yeers captivity to the Jews, to be a day of darknesse indeed; but as for any paper writing, an Answer by Reasons and words to be so to me like the 70. yeers captivity and a day of darknesse, I cannot imagine: I had thought <HI>Cretensis</HI> Answers would have been rather a day of new light to the world and to me, then a day of darknesse, especially considering what <HI>Cretensis</HI> faith <HI>pag.</HI> 16. of light and truth: I am somewhat doubtful and suspitious of <HI>Cretensis</HI> threatnings, be|cause of the ill usage of some Ministers by some Souldiers, and of many words given out daily by too many of <HI>Cretensis</HI> Saints in our Armies, against the Presbyterian Orthodox Ministers: I cannot well tell what other con|struction to make of <HI>Cretensis</HI> words, they are very doubtful and dangereous words; What an Answer, to be as the sore judgement of the 70. yeers captivi|ty against the sons of <HI>Belial,</HI> and to be darknesse and not light? I have read &amp; heard of such Answers in matters of difference between great men, who in|stead of an Answer in writing, or with an Answer in writing have sent an Army of ten or twenty thousand men; and I must tell the Reader what increases my fears, I cannot well tell how it first came into my head, but I have had a strong opinion this 18. moneths, and expressed it to divers, that my <HI>Antapo|logie</HI> would never be answered till the Independents had got that power one way or other as to cast me into prison, to seiz on all my papers and writings by which I should make good my proof, and then they would bring forth an Answer to my <HI>Antapologie</HI>: Now considering how far and how high in many things the Independents have proceeded, and <HI>Cretensis</HI> threating me with such a kind of Answer, I am apt to interpret him thus; and truly were it not that there is a Noble General, and the greatest part of the Army by farre, as I have expressed often, free from <HI>Cretens.</HI> way, and that I live in a good strong City neer the High Court of Parliament, and by the Honourable Court of Common-Counsel, I should expect and be afraid that his threating might be fulfilled before ever his Reply to <HI>Antapologia</HI> would be ready to come a|broad: But whereas <HI>Cretensis</HI> saith, that he verily beleeves his Answer to my <HI>Antapologie</HI> will not be for my honour, in which respect I have no great ground to be so restlesse and importunate in calling for it: I Reply, the <HI>Antapology</HI> (I am sure) was for the honour of the cause I undertook, and
<PB N="49" REF="73">
turned to my honor both at home and abroad, and made not for the honor of the Apologists and Independent party; neither do I believe <HI>Cretensis</HI> Reply to my <HI>Antapology</HI> will make more for his honor, then this brief Answer of his to <HI>Gangraena</HI>: And however for the present <HI>Cretensis</HI> Reply when it comes first forth, by his railings, revilings, scoffs and lyes put upon me, may not make for my honor; yet by that time my Rejoynder can be made and printed, it shall appear to all the world, that the whole businesse, both <HI>Apologetical Nar|ration, Antapology, Cretensis</HI> Reply, and my Rejoynder, will make for the honor of the Presbyterian cause, and of my self, as a poor Instrument plead|ing for it against the Zanzumins of the time, and to the dishonour both of the Apologists and their great Champion <HI>Cretensis.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cretensis</HI> in this 15 <HI>page</HI> makes an Apology, and gives his Reasons why Mr. <HI>Edwards Antapology</HI> is not answered in so long a time as 18. Moneths, name|ly, <HI>That the Independents are not men who have little or nothing to do like Pres|byterians, having the priviledge of ease to Preach to bare walls and pews in their meeting places, nor that shamelesnesse of forehead to make the subject matter of their Sermons little else but loose, lying, and frivolous reports and stories, or vi|rulent invectives against the Saints as the Presbyterians; neither was the way free and open to bring light into the world, but hedged up with Clergy, Classique Councels as with thorns against them: And besides, Mr.</HI> Edwards <HI>took not much lesse then</HI> 18. <HI>Moneths time for his Antapology, and therefore no Wonder if the Independents be not men of more expedition.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply. Cretensis</HI> plays the Sophister here, making use of that fallacy <HI>non causa pro causa,</HI> giving the false cause of not Replying, and concealing the true; and that all these are false, is evident: 1. Because <HI>Cretensis</HI> hath had leasure to have attended the motions of my pen, and hath since the 18 moneths given an account to the world more then once, twice, thrice, and had leasure now, the priviledge of ease, to make an Answer to <HI>Gangraena,</HI> and could he not with the labour of all these have Replyed to <HI>Antapology?</HI> It should seem for all the weaknesse, contradictions, and such like, which <HI>Cretensis</HI> speaks of <HI>An|tapology,</HI> 'tis a hard piece that <HI>Cretensis</HI> can write and print five several Books, have time enough <HI>from his constant and standing labors with those who have committed themselves to him in the Lord,</HI> before he finde time to Reply to <HI>An|tapology</HI>: Besides, <HI>Cretensis</HI> had five great Champions the Apologists to assist him in it, some of which will be found to have or to take more priviledge of ease, and seldom Preaching then the Presbyterians use to take, and some of them have had leasure to Print other things since, wherein not so much con|cerned; as also <HI>Cretensis</HI> hath a priviledge of ease and idlenesse when he pleases to help himself (which none of the Presbyterians have) <HI>viz.</HI> to ap|point some of his Prophets in his Church to Preach for him, which he fre|quently
<PB N="50" REF="74">
practises upon all occasions, as I can prove, and hath upon pretence of answering my <HI>Antapology.</HI> 2. Some Independents have that shamelesnesse of forehead, to make the subject matter of their Sermons little else but loose, lying, frivolous reports and stories, or virusent invectives against the Saints, &amp;c. as Mr. <HI>Peters, the Vicar General and Metropolitane of the Independents, both in New and Old England</HI>: and I wonder how <HI>Cretensis</HI> forgot him: Name any Presbyterian, who is of any account in the Church of God, such a loose rambling Preacher as he: And for his invectives against the Saints, 'tis one of his common places in many of his Sermons to speak against the Re|formed Churches, the Reverend Ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mbly, and the godly Presbyterian Mini|sters of the Kingdom, who are not only Saints, but godly Ministers: But Mr. <HI>Peters</HI> is not alone, for <HI>Cretensis</HI> himself is a loose Preacher, and full of bitter invectives in his Sermons against better Sain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s and Servants of God, then ever himself, or any of his Church is like to be (the particular passages which he hath used in Sermons, I will give the Reader in my full Reply) and so Mr. <HI>Archer</HI> of <HI>Hausted</HI> is famou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, or rather infamous for this, <HI>cum multis aliis,</HI> whom in my large Reply I may adde to these: As for the third Reaso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, <HI>the way stopt against Printing for want of a Lic&eacute;nser,</HI> I have already refu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, and shall speak more to it in my next Reply: And for the fourth Reason brought by <HI>Cretensis,</HI> to Apologize for not Replying in 18 Moneths, 'tis both for matter and form all false, &amp; a man would wonder that <HI>Cretens:</HI> should dare to write so (though indeed nothing of this kinde is a wonder in <HI>Cretensis</HI>). <HI>Cretensis,</HI> how can you answer it to God, to your Church, and to all men, to write such a manifest untruth? That I took not much lesse then eighteen Mo|neths in making the <HI>Antapology,</HI> when as the <HI>Apologetical Narration</HI> (I am sure of it) came forth in the Moneth of <HI>December,</HI> and to my best remem|brance towards the later end of it, and my <HI>Antapology</HI> was printed and a|broad either the last week of <HI>Iune</HI> following, or the first of <HI>Iuly,</HI> which at the farthest was not full seven Moneths, and is far from eighteen Moneths: As for that insinuation of <HI>Cretensis</HI> joyned to the eighteen Moneths, <HI>the advantage of liberty, and freedom from other ingagements which Mr.</HI> Edwards <HI>had above other men,</HI> 'tis a false one; for from that time I began to Answer <HI>Apologet. Narrati|on,</HI> till it came forth, I never had lesse liberty or freedom in my life, nor more businesses and engagements of several sorts in reference to the Publike, Preaching in that time of writing my Book very often, three times a week constantly, and many times four, besides the tedious Journeys between <HI>Lon|don</HI> and <HI>Godalming,</HI> riding to Preach there; together with all the difficulties and fears of many Alarums from the Enemy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in that time. But before I draw to a conclusion of this, I desire the Reader to observe what a proud arrogant speech this is of <HI>Cretensis</HI> to extoll himself and his party, with the
<PB N="51" REF="74">
contempt and scorn of the Presbyterians, <HI>If Independent Ministers had either the priviledge of ease to preach to the bare walls and pews in their meeting places:</HI> Now for this in my large Reply I will acquaint the Reader what privileges Independent Ministers and Independent Saints have and take above the Pres|byterians, and what their priviledge of ease and idlenesse is above the Pres|byterians, as also shew the true Reasons why the world wanders after the Beast, many of the Independents are so stockt after before Presbyterians; as also by what a sort of people, and what little cause <HI>Cretensis</HI> and his Saints have to glory and boast of it; and when I have spoken to that at large, I believe I shall be out of <HI>Cretensis</HI> debt for these words.</P>
<P>Only for present I shall tell <HI>Cretensis</HI> these three things. 1. That there are Presbyterian Ministers who Preach no more to bare walls and pews then <HI>Cretensis</HI> and the Independent Ministers, Mr. <HI>Marshal,</HI> Mr. <HI>Whitaker,</HI> Mr. <HI>Calamy,</HI> Mr. <HI>Sedgwick, cum multis aliis,</HI> both in City and Countrey. 2. There are many Independent Ministers who have Preached lately, and do so still as much to bare walls and pews as any Presbyterians, witnesse Mr. <HI>Burton,</HI> Mr. <HI>Davis,</HI> Mr. <HI>Freak,</HI> Mr. <HI>Ellis,</HI> Mr. <HI>Furman, &amp;c.</HI> 3. Presbyterians do not use however Independents may (as <HI>Cretensis</HI> in his speech implyes) to have ever the more priviledge of ease by Preaching to a few rather then to many, by Preaching to a hundred two or three, or Preaching to a thousand or two, for they Preach out of Conscience and discharge of duty, to do good to the souls of men, and not for applause to please a multitude, and therefore tis all one to them whether there be fewer or more, one hundred or many; but this is expressed according to the Independent humor, who have their Sermons of several sorts, those of greater pains and study when their pews and walls are full, and their Sermons of ease when their pews are empty, and their walls bare. Now to put a period to this fourteen Section, with an Animadversion upon that passage of <HI>Cretensis</HI> in <HI>pag.</HI> 16. his <HI>constant and standing labors with those who have committed themselves to him in the Lord.</HI> I ask of <HI>Cretensis</HI> where he findes this used of a people to commit themselves unto the Mini|sters; we are commanded to commit our way to the Lord, and to commit our souls to him, and of God 'tis oft used; but in what place is it of people to Ministers, and then those who have committed themselves to you; why did you not say to the Church rather? what is <HI>Cretensis</HI> become the Church? And lastly, why was it not as well expressed, <HI>Those to whom I have committed my self unto in the Lord?</HI> for I believe upon better consideration, it will be found, that <HI>Cretensis</HI> hath as much committed himself to his people, as they to him; for they Preach and rule as well as <HI>Cretensis</HI>; and believe upon Exami|nation (the Church will be found to Preach oftner then <HI>Cretensis,</HI> for all his constant and standing labors) and his yong Prophets to exercise upon the
<PB N="52" REF="75">
week and Lords day, and he bound to hear and obey them as well as they him: And now if <HI>How</HI> the Cobler were alive again, <HI>Cretensis</HI> and he would have no more Disputation and difference about humane learning ne|cessary to the Interpreting of Scriptures, and Preaching of the Word, seeing <HI>Cretensis</HI> allows it now in his Church Members far inferior to <HI>How,</HI> and <HI>Cre|tensis</HI> would crave pardon of him for abusing him, so as he did upon that Con|troversie; and for a recompence unto him, Mr. <HI>How</HI> should be preferred to be Teacher in <HI>Cretensis</HI> Church; Mr. <HI>Cretensis</HI> the Pastor, and Mr. <HI>How</HI> the Teacher; for belike humane learning is not now necessary to the Preaching of the Word; and sure we shall one day have a Book of <HI>Cretensis</HI> Retracta|tions and Confessions, and might have had it before this time, but that <HI>Cre|tensis</HI> knows not how his minde may change again, and what New Light he may yet have; and so he will stay till he dyes, that we may have it altogether, and without any more change.</P>
<P><HI>Cretensis Sect:</HI> 15. <HI>pag.</HI> 17.18, 19. with a great many of flourishing words and a bold face, labors to possesse the Reader, That in my <HI>Antapology</HI> and <HI>Gangraena</HI> I have done nothing else almost but labored with might and main to call for fire from Hell to destroy the Saints, to inflame the powers of this world with hatred and bloodinesse of spirit against the Sons and Daughters of God, and to importure the Civil Magistrate to pour out themselves in wrath and indignation against them, charging me with <HI>a bloody Negotiation</HI> in writing <HI>Gangraena,</HI> inveteracenesse and Dragon-likenesse of spirit, and how diametrally opposite in the cause and courses I take against Sectaries, I am to Christ, <HI>Paul, Austin, Calvin</HI> and <HI>Luther.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply. Cretensis</HI> goes upon a false foundation, supposing all those to be Saints, the Sons and Daughters of God, whom I speak against in <HI>Gangraena,</HI> which is stark false, and of which I shall give in my large Reply a satisfactory account to the world of that mistake; for however they are <HI>Cretensis</HI> Saints, they are none of Gods Saints, and the man erres, not knowing the Scriptures; they may well go for Saints in <HI>Cretensis</HI> Kalender, but never in my Creed, neither go they for Saints in Mr. <HI>Thomas Goodwins</HI> late <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>Thomas Goodwins</HI> Sermon call'd <HI>The great Interest of State and Kingdom,</HI> p. 53. <HI>If any man think I am a pleading for a Liberty of all Opinions, of what nature, and how grosse so|ever, I humbly desire them to remember that I only plead for Saints</HI>; and I answer plainly, The Saints need it not.

<P N="2">2. What ever I speak in both my Books upon this point to the Civil Magistrate, is no other but what the Scripture clearly holds out; and though I have done it with affection and zeal, yet not
<PB N="53" REF="75">
with bitternesse nor bloodinesse, and I am confident that <HI>Cretensis</HI> nor all his compeers cannot in all their r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ading shew me two Books of any Divine who proves so much, and so foul things as I do in my <HI>Antapology</HI> and <HI>Gangraena,</HI> written with more moderation, fairnesse, and with lesse bitternesse; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et <HI>Cretensis</HI> in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Book instance in any bloody bit|ter passages, alwayes provided, he wrest not words nor leave out no part of sentences.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Sectaries themselves and <HI>Cretensis</HI> too will one day confesse Master <HI>Edwards</HI> in opposing Errors, Heresies, discoveri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g them, and stir|ring up the Mag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">strates to their duty, was their good Friend, a merciful man, one who both with fear and compassion would have saved them out of the fire; and I would ask <HI>Cretensis,</HI> whether are they more merciful, ten|der, that will not let little Children, sick persons, mad men do what they will, go where they please, eat what they list; or they who use all good means to hinder them, and provide wholsome food and medicines for them; yea, I am of the minde, before a yeer comes about the Magistrates and Kingdom will say Master <HI>Edwards,</HI> and those men who either by Writing or Preaching spoke most against the Errors, Heresies, Schisms of the times, and Toleration, and stirred us up to hinder and suppresse their growth, were most merciful both to the souls and bodies of men, and to the Kindoms, and far from bloodinesse, bitternesse, or inveteratenesse.</P>
<P N="4">4. Whosoever doth but well read the Scriptures, and observe what quick sharp passages are there recorded to have come from the mouth of Christ and his Apostles against Errors, Heresies, and false Teachers, yea, sharper and more spoken against false Doctrines and false Teachers, then against bad manners, (as for instance, <HI>Matthew</HI> 7.15. <HI>Galatians</HI> 1.8, 9. and 5.10, 12.2 <HI>Peter</HI> 2.1, 2, 3.2 <HI>Iohn</HI> 9.10, 11. the whole Epistle of <HI>Iude, Revelation</HI> 2.14, 15, 20, 22, 23. with a hundred other such) will never blame me for bitternesse, bloodinesse, inveteratenesse, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> furiousnesse and over eagernesse in my opposing Errors and false Teach|ers, who according to my poor measure have endeavoured in oppo|sing Errors, to follow the Example of Christ and his Apostles, though I have fallen far short of my duty in this kinde, not improving my time and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">alents, but wanting in that Zeal, Courage, Diligence, re|quisite to this work: (And however <HI>Cretensis</HI> and his Compeers think I have over-done) yet I have great cause to be deeply humbled for do|ing no more, and to hie me into my Study, and cry, <HI>misirere mei Domine</HI>: But to draw to a conclusion, I shall in&punc; this case Answer <HI>Cretensis</HI> and all the Sectaries who accuse me, and cry out of my eagernesse and over|doing, as <HI>Luther</HI> did <HI>Erasmus,</HI> charging him for too much vehemency.
<PB N="54" REF="76">
<HI>But that I have dealt in this cause more vehemently I confesse it a fault,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quod autem vehementius ego|vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, agnos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> culpum, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> culpa est, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> testimonium hoc mihi in mundo reddi in causa Dei miri|fice gaudeo: Atque utinam &amp; ipse Deus id testimo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ie in novis|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ime die confirmares<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">?

<P N="5">5. The bitternes, bloodines, &amp;c. with which <HI>Cretens.</HI> labours to load me, will be found in <HI>Cretensis</HI> and the Sectaries, and as they grow in power and number, will be discovered every day more and more; can any man think that <HI>Cretensis</HI> who hath so much rage and malice in his heart, and so much gall in his pen, (as he discovers in this Book against all Presbyterians) would not if he had power do as much with his hand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and be another <HI>Bonner,</HI> or an|other <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Leyden</HI>? God keep the Presbyterians out of the hands of the Independents and Sectaries when they come to have power, and think they are strong enough to Master them; doth not <HI>Cretensis</HI> discover his bloody mindednesse against me in the three last lines, of this 15. Section, inviting as it were some of his Sectaries to fall upon me, preaching that doctrine to them. <HI>That whatsoever I shall suffer by any Sectary for writing against them, I shall suffer but as a Malefactor and an evil doer</HI>; Now for proof of the bloody mindednesse, persecution and liberty of Conscience which the Sectaries will give the Orthodox, when they come to be stronger, and of all the means they use, and wayes they take to give the Presbytery liberty of Conscience, I shall in my full Reply to <HI>Cretensis,</HI> speak at large: only for present thus much, they labour to get all the power of Arms they possibly can into their hands, and the command of all the great Towns and Ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ies, and by one way or other to turn out of place, keep out, obstruct, blast all cordial zealous Presby|terians, all which, no doubt, are done to give the Presbyterians liberty of con|science, and now they give the Presbyterians good words <HI>viz.</HI> that they will send them packing to <HI>Rome,</HI> that it were a good deed they were hanged, and knocked on the head, their guts goared out, that they are Antichristian Priests, cursed Priests, damned Priests, with such like; all which no doubt, are fore|runners of the liberty of Conscience the Sectaries intend for the Presby|terians; and for the proof I will give <HI>Cretensis</HI> a few instances.
<Q>The first is

from <HI>Lynne,</HI> (a place well known to <HI>Cretensis</HI>) concerning one <HI>Iohnson</HI> a Sectary and a Cannoneer, who discoursing concerning Presbyterians and Independents, said that Presbyterians would have their guts goared out; and being answered that the Presbyterial government was ordered by both Houses of Parliament, and that he be|ing in the service ought not to speak against them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This sent up to a Parliament man, and a true Copy of this given me by a Member of the Assembly.</NOTE> he answered for all that, they should have their guts goared out:</Q>

<P><HI>Cretensis</HI> in Sect. 18. and 19. layes down four things, 1. That in the 70.

That I do falsly and forgingly represent the opinion by fathering that mangrel expression <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>credere</HI> upon it, and which is no where used by him throughout the Controversie. 3. That I charge him to quote <HI>Calvin, Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er,</HI> &amp; affirm others for his opinion in the point of <HI>Iustification,</HI> whom yet I affirm to be professedly of another judgement in the Doctrine of <HI>Iustification,</HI> which he declares to be false, and then quotes some places out of <HI>Calvin, Bu|cer,</HI> for the justifying of himself, and disproving my former Allegation. 4. He recriminates, asperses, and jeers at me, that in my going about to rectifie the mistakes of others, and being the great <HI>Aristarchus</HI> of the Errors, and Here|sies of the times, have my self vented Atheological and putid assertions in the point of <HI>Iustification,</HI> as in <HI>Gangraena page.</HI> 22. in the margin, and that if <HI>Calvin</HI>
<PB N="56" REF="77">
and <HI>Bucer</HI> be not for him, but I shall stand still to deny it, he must professe ingenuously that he knows no reason but to judge me uncapable of the English sense of a Latin sentence; and that if I deny <HI>Calvin, Bucer,</HI> and others whom he quotes to be of the same judgement with him in the point of <HI>Iustification,</HI> then I either shew my self to be a very illiterate man, and not able to construe a peece of plain Latin, or else charge <HI>Calvin, Bucer,</HI> and the rest, with being of a judgement as contrary to themselves as to him, and then quoting <HI>Calvin,</HI> speaks to me, <HI>If I can construe Latin, to confesse in English whether</HI> Calvin <HI>be of a differing judgement from him in the point of Iustification.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> 'Tis a sign <HI>Cretentis</HI> hath a quilty conscience, that upon the naming of an Error about <HI>Iustification,</HI> without the least reflecting upon him in any kind, he should take it so to himself, as to say I meant him particularly; there are divers other Sectaries besides <HI>Cretensis</HI> who hold this Error, whom I might aime at, and did intend as well as Master <HI>Goodwin.</HI> Secondly I have neither falsly nor forgingly represented the opinion in using that expression of <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>credere,</HI> though I should grant that to be true, (which yet I do not) that <HI>Cretensis</HI> hath never in Sermons, Disputations nor Books written by him ex|pressed himself after this manner. 1. Because there being other Sectaries besides <HI>Cretensis</HI> holding the same opinion, if they have used T&ograve; <HI>credere</HI> in Discourses, and defended it, that's enough to justifie me. 2 In <HI>Cretensis</HI> Books of justification, 'tis more then once affirmed <HI>in terminis</HI> that <HI>Faith in a proper sense, is imputed to justification, and not Christs righteousnesse imputed,</HI> and now indeed he sayes and unsaies, shuffles and cuts, seems to say the same with other Divines, and then presently the con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rary, I shall show (God willing) at large in my full Reply. 3. T&ograve; <HI>credere</HI> used by me in setting down this Error, cannot be justly termed a representing the opinion falsely and for|gingly, it being used commonly by all Divines that handle this opinion, both by the Orthodox who writ against it, and those who are for it: <HI>Arminius</HI> holding this opinion, used this expression as learned <HI>Gomaras</HI> in a Confe|rence held with <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Praefat. ad Eccl. auie Acta Synod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> National, Dordr.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Arminius,</HI> proved from <HI>Armi|nius</HI> own hand writing, wherein he maintained that in mans justification before God, the righte|ousnesse of Christ not to be imputed to justification, but faith is self, or T&ograve; <HI>credere</HI> by the gracious acceptance of God to be that righteousnesse of ours by which we are justified before God; yea, and <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Wotton <HI>de Reconcil. par</HI> 2. <HI>lib.</HI> 1 <HI>cap.</HI> 15. <HI>pag,</HI> 175.176.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>Wotton</HI> himself <HI>Cretensis</HI> Master speaks so, but when we say faith justifies, we understand <HI>ipsum credere,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">; 3. For that charge against <HI>Cretensis</HI> of quoting <HI>Calvin, Bucer,</HI> and and others for him, when they are known <HI>ex professo</HI> to be of an|other judgement, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tis most true and just, and a man would wonder at the
<PB N="57" REF="77">
impudency of <HI>Cretensis</HI> to deny it, and to quote <HI>Calvin</HI> and <HI>Bucer</HI> again as he does; and before I have done with <HI>Cretensis</HI> it shall appear that I will make good the charge against him, and yet neither show my self a very illiterate man, not able to construe a peece of plain Latin, nor yet charge <HI>Calvin, Luther,</HI> and the rest with being of a judgement contrary to them|selves, but discover him to be an impudent caviller and falsifier of Authors.

preach'd, that tis a manifest and clear truth and hath passed the Presbyterian fire it self, and is come forth in full waight, &amp;c. till you know what the sense of the House of Commons will be upon it; when 'tis reported to the House according to the order of the Committee, and the House hath cleared you, then you might better have used these words; but <HI>Cretensis,</HI> though you say the bitternesse of death is past, all danger is over, you may be de|ceived, <HI>quod desertur non aufertur,</HI> the House may be at more leasure and call upon such kinde of things, and upon a review you may be made to know what 'tis, not only to slight and vilifie a Parliament, open a gap to a total contempt of all their Authority and power, but when you have done so, then openly and publikely to justifie that what you have said is a manifest and clear truth. <HI>Cretensis</HI> I tell you plainly, I would not for all the Books in my study, the Independens could prove such words spoken by me against the power and dignity of Parliament, how light account soever you make of them.</P>
<P>Fourthly, the Reader may by this clearly see what to judge of <HI>Cretensis</HI> charging me and my Book with lying forgery &amp;c. when as he is not ashamed to tax me in this place, that I could not lightly have uttered any thing that struck more dangerously at the very root of all Parliamentary Authority and power, then to say that <HI>Cretensis</HI> in speaking against the Parliament and their power, opened a gap to sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ghting of their authority and power; what a strange art and faculty hath <HI>Cretensis</HI> as of making all Authors for him, though they writ against him; so of making master <HI>Edwards,</HI> and his Abet|tors in pleading for the Parliament against <HI>Cretensis,</HI> to strike dangerously at the very root of all Parliamentary Authority and power? and that notwith|standing for the words <HI>Cretensis</HI> spake against the Parliament he was com|plained of to the Committee of Plundered Ministers by understanding men and cordial to the Parliament, and the matter so deeply resented by the Honourable Committee, as I have already expressed; but the truth of it is, <HI>Cretensis</HI> in all his writings, both in point of opinions, and words that he utters in defence of them, he will say any thing as manifestly contrary to truth, as to affirm black is white, and darknesse light; neither will he be beaten out of it by any reason, but hides himself, and clouds things in a multitude of words, where an ordinary Reader loses himself as in a wood.</P>
<P>Fifthly, 'tis strange <HI>Cretensis,</HI> you dare say that you know none but Pres|byterians have broken in at the gap you have made, do you not know what <HI>Lilburn</HI> hath done? besides have you not read <HI>Englands Birthright, The Or|dinance for Tythes Dismounted? cum multis aliis?</HI> you indeed lead the way, and was the first of all the pretended friends to the Parliament, out of discontent in missing a place in the Assembly) who spake so slightly and scornfully of the

<P><Q><HI>Cretensis</HI> Sect. 23. makes a great deal of do, spending many leaves in ex|cusing himself, and some of his Church for bowling on a day of publike thanksgiving, telling the Reader it was in the evening, and in the company of Presbyterians, and but for about half an hour; and he relates a story of four Presbyterians spending an afternoon upon a day of Thanksgiving in fishing; and threatens that if I go on in telling tales of Independents, he or some others will tell stories of Presbyterian mistakes in the night, and of a Presbyterian Angel, who hath committed some foul offence, yea and that he hath a Manuscript by him concerning Master <HI>Edwards</HI> himself, which discovereth his jugling, and indirect walking between the two Towns of <HI>Godalming</HI> in Surry, and <HI>Dunmow</HI> in Essex; and that if there be no remedy, it will be content to submit it self to the Presse, and there|fore concludes if I go on to lay open the Sectaries; I have devoted the names and reputation of all Presbyterians who are obnoxius to the uni|versal abhorring both of the present and future ages, and therefore saith it concerns all Presbyterians in general, and the Doctorage of this way more particularly to heal the Gangren of my pen, and to restrain the fur|ther spreading of it, otherwise their names and reputations are but so many dead corpses.</Q></P>

for about half an hour to the exercise; the sun being by that time either down, or very neer it.</HI> Now these words of <HI>Cretensis,</HI> b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ings to my mind that answer of <HI>Aaron</HI> to <HI>Moses</HI> about the golden Calf; <HI>then I cast the gold into the fire, and there came out this calf</HI>; as if the Calf made it self, and came out without hands: So <HI>Cretensis</HI> cast a Bowl &amp;c. How much mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e becomming a Christian, and a Minister of the Gospel had it been, for Master <HI>Goodwin</HI> to have given glory to God, and to have said as <HI>Iob, If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosome</HI>; but as <HI>Cre|tensis</HI> throughout his whole discourse, hath twenty &amp; ten fetches about, to pal|liat, excuse, slite, make a mock of all the horrid Heresies, Blasphemies, and Practises of all the Sectaries spoken of by me, so doth he the same here of him|self and some of his Church. Now that the Reader may be undeceived, though the first relation of this busines was told me accidentally as it was to another, without inquiry or thought on my part (though then so spoken, as by cir|cumstances I concluded it to be true;) yet since <HI>Cretensis</HI> Answer came for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h I have enquired more particularly into it, and I have it upon good ground to be after this manner; <HI>Cretensis</HI> preached in the morning, but in the afternoon was at no Sermon, not joyning himself to spend the latter part of the day with any of the society of Gods people in Thanksgiving for so great a victory; but in the afternoon went a walking with some of his Church, and after that to Bowls, and instead of <HI>Cretensis about half an hour, that he stirred himself a little by casting a Bowl</HI>; he played at Bowls about two hours; and give over at such time, (which therefore is not probable to be when the sun was gon down,) that another company came and played after them. Now I could a|nimadvert divers things upon this relation of <HI>Cretensis,</HI> aswell as <HI>Cretensis</HI> hath <HI>pag.</HI> 32, 33, 34, 35. <HI>viz</HI> 1. that we may see Independents have a <HI>priviledge of ease,</HI> yea, and of prophanesse too, to sit idle at home, or walk abroad to take their pleasure, when the poor Presbyterians are either preaching or praying, or else joyning themselves to the Assemblies, where preaching, prayer and o|ther holy worships are performing; and if <HI>Cretensis</HI> will pretend he was a weary of his preaching in the forenoon, and so somewhat indisposed to fur|ther labour that day; I answer, this is just Bishoplike, who when their Lord|ships had preached in a forenoon, they were so weary they could not so much as come to Church that afternoon; but <HI>Cretensis,</HI> though you were so weary as you could not preach, could you not have come, and given thanks for the Victory; nay, if that had been too much trouble for your Lordship, because of your great wearinesse and indisposedness after your great labors, to have gone abroad to some of the Presbyterians Churches; could you not have gathered your Church together in your house, appointed some of your Prophets to have exercised, and you only have sate by as at other times, resting your weary
<PB N="64" REF="81">
bones. Truly <HI>Cretensis</HI> in my minde this is a very poor put off, and sorry shift.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Cretensis</HI> for all his wearinesse and indisposednesse to further labour of preaching, or hearing that day, yet was so eager upon his sports that he knew not how the time went away making a long half hour, reckoning half an hour for two hours&punc; but <HI>Cretensis</HI> might easily mistake in this, and I shall excuse him, it being usual for men in their sports to think time short, and to judge they have not been an hour when they have been playing two or three; but I will spare <HI>Cretensis</HI> and animadvert no farther for present, neither on the story nor on his Animadversions upon it.</P>
<P>Secondly, as for that <HI>Cretensis</HI> brings by way of excuse, some Presbyte|rians played with him, &amp;c. I Answer, it was their fault and sin, neither will I go about to plead for <HI>Baal,</HI> nor palliate excuse things that are evil in Pres|byterians, as <HI>Cretensis</HI> doth all kind of horrid Blasphemies and Heresies in his Sectaries: however <HI>Cretensis</HI> is never the lesse in fault because of com|pany; and indeed <HI>Cretensis</HI> being a Minister, should have given them (being private Christians) better example, besides who knows but <HI>Cretensis</HI> example drew these Presbyterians to it, and further 'tis likely these Presbyterians had been in the afternoon at some Presbyterian Church, offered up to God both a morning and evening sacrifice of thanksgiving, came from home later then <HI>Cretensis</HI> and his Brethren, neither doth <HI>Cretensis</HI> say the Presbyterians came forth with him, but as he tels his own tale, he relates that after his walking about a quarter of a mile (which might be a mile, as well as his half hours bowling two hours) and after his coming into the Garden, and sitting about half an hour in an Arbour (which we may well reckon for an hour to) came in some <HI>of Master Edwards judgement</HI> of Church-Government; all which being considered, makes the matter not so bad in the Prebyterians as in <HI>Cretensis,</HI> but supposing all this, yet I will not excuse them.</P>
<P>Thirdly, as for that story of one of the Assembly with three more of his com&mdash;or sub&punc; Presbyters, rather four Ministers in all (expressed by <HI>Cretensis</HI> all a long in a scoffing, yea in a prophane manner; bringing in hea|ven and Gods providence to make up his jefts and jeers) spending a whole afternoon upon a day of Thanksgiving in fishing. I greatly blame them, and if there was any such thing, they have cause to be ashamed of it as well as you for your bowling; and it had been fitter for them four Ministers to have been fishing for the souls of men, preaching somewhere in the afternoon, then a catching of Roaches; and thus you see <HI>Cretensis</HI> I am impartial, not (like the Independents) excusing all things in Presbyterians as they in Sectaries though never so vilde, and therefore your Proverb of <HI>Presbyterians having a priviledge to steal Horses</HI> holds not as you see, for I am against a <HI>Toleration of them to look on.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="81">Fourthly, As for your threats of discovering Presbyterian mistakes in the night, and to leave the world to judge whether they be not worse then Inde|pendents bowling on dayes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and of the story of a Presbyterian Angel which you will clap to my mouth, and stop it for ever: I answer, do your worst, discover what <HI>Presbyterian mistakes in the night</HI> you can, and tell what stories you please of a <HI>Presbyterian Angel,</HI> I fear you not, it will not stop my month: I blesse God, he who <HI>keepeth the feet of his Saints,</HI> hath so preserved me, that I care not what all the Sectaries under Heaven can say a|gainst me, I blesse God, I have whereof to rejoyce and glory before men (though before God I know my manifold weaknesses and transgressions, and have nothing to glory in but the free mercy of God, and the righteousnesse of Jesus Christ) and therefore <HI>Cretensis</HI> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> you mean me, by <HI>mistakes in the night, and by Presbyterian Angel</HI> (as your words seem to infinuate, speaking unto me, and the Reader may be apt to take your meaning so) speak out, do your worst, I defie you and all your company to prove any such things, or but the suspition of them; for I must tell you <HI>Cretensis,</HI> I have ever since I came to be a Preacher of the Gospel walked by that rule of the Apostle, <HI>Providing honest things, not only in sight of the Lord, but in the sight of men</HI>: And as for other Presbyterian Ministers, if any of them have walked loosely and scanda|lously, let them look to it, I will be no Patron for them, neither will I have my mouth stopped from opening the Errors, Heresies, Practises of the Secta|ries, or laying open by name Impostors and Seducers, to gratifie the conceal|ment of somthing soul in a Presbyterian, let them bear the shame of it for all me, and give God glory in confessing; only I would desire <HI>Cretensis</HI> and the Reader to observe the difference between my Discourse of Errors, Heresies, and Practises in Sectaries, and <HI>Cretensis</HI> discovery threatned.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Cretensis</HI> Discovery will be out of revenge, malice, because the Errors of the Sectaries are laid open, and which otherwise he implies should not have been discovered, and if I would cease laying open the Errors of the times, those stories should never have come to light; but now my Catalogue was and is purely out of conscience, not out of ill-will to any man, but to preserve many from falling, and to recover others before they are gone too far.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Errors, Practises, wayes which I lay down throughout my Book, are the very principles and wayes of the Sectaries as such Sectaries, either being their Opinions, or flowing necessarily from them, or are means made use of by them to increase their way, compasse their designs, whereas any per|sonal miscarriages of the Presbyterians are far from falling under any such considerations; but the fruits of the flesh and Satan taking advantage upon them, of which things they have no fruit, but are ashamed and have repented.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="66" REF="82">3. These Errors and Practises in the Sectaries are now found in them, cleaving to them since, and not before they turn'd Sectaries, whereas these miscarriages of the Presbyterians, are not now upon them, nor never since they were Presbyterians, but may be many years before, when Episcopal and foolish.</P>
<P N="4">4.

And for the matter of <HI>Dunmow,</HI> I have so much certainty and confidence of it, that if it were known commonly, it would turn to my great honor (which here <HI>Cretensis</HI> threatens me with as a matter of reproach, and indeed the only thing, which belike <HI>Cretensis</HI> in all his gathering and enquirings after me, could light upon to upbraid me with) as that I dare refer it and stand to the Arbitrament of Mr. <HI>Thomas Goodwin,</HI> Mr. <HI>Burroughs,</HI> Mr. <HI>Bridge,</HI> (whom all the world knows, through difference of judgement, are not my best friend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">) whether in that businesse I be to be blamed, or rather have not done a singular thing, and like a man who hath walked circumspectly, avoiding all appearance of evil: And truly <HI>Cretensis</HI> you may give a loser leave to speak, which for the present I shall do briefly (reserving the large relation, both of <HI>Dunmow</HI> and <HI>Godalming,</HI> to my fuller Reply) and whatever I speak, and much more will be attested under the hands of many godly Ministers, some dwelling neer <HI>Dunmow,</HI> and acquaint|ed with this businesse from first to last, others, Members of the Assembly in|trusted also in it, and under the hands of divers godly persons of the Town, fully knowing the businesse, together with the Minister of the Town, the now present Incumbent.</P>
<P>In brief, the great businesse of my <HI>jugling and indirect walking between the two Towns of Godalming in Surrey, and Dunmow in Essex,</HI> was this, that to prevent the coming in, and for removing out one gotten in against the con|sents and liking of the godly people, and the Ministers intrusted in the busi|nesse to provide for them, my name was made use of to the Committee for Plundred Ministers to be put in for the Sequestration of <HI>Dunmow</HI>; and without it, as things stood in that case (the particular whereof, with that whole businesse from first to last, I shall hereafter relate at large) it was judged both by godly Ministers and the people, (and therefore I earnestly entreated to give way to it) there was no other way to effect it; which title I held for a few weeks, meerly for the good of the People, till an able and fit man could be found out for the place; in which time that my name was putting in, and was in, though I was put to a great deal of trouble, and some charge in Jour|neys, riding three several times to <HI>Dunmow,</HI> besides other expences for the good of the place, as in disappointing men to come in upon them, and other|wise

<HI>That Story Mr.</HI> Edwards <HI>hath</HI> pag. 79 <HI>of one</HI> Nichols, <HI>and of a meeting concluded of, occasioned by some vile opinions vented by that</HI> Nichols; <HI>where Mr.</HI> Greenhil <HI>and my self (he saith) was, together with divers passages that he relates came from me at that meeting is all false.

<P>This passage in <HI>Cretensis</HI> answer of all others (especially because of Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> testimony given in writing under his hand, besides mention made of Mr. <HI>Greenhil</HI> to in this testimony, that he knew of no such meeting with <HI>Nichols,</HI> but wondred to see such a thing in Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> his Book) took most with many to weaken the truth and credit not only of this story related by me of one <HI>Nichols,</HI> but of many other Relations in my Book, this being objected to many of my Friends; you see what Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> hath given under his hand; and therefore because of the great name of Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> and Mr. <HI>Greenhil</HI> (which <HI>Cretensis</HI> makes use of here) to make my story numerous in particular forgeries beyond measure, I shall inlarge upon it, to make good the truth of it, notwithstanding Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> testimony to the contrary, and <HI>Cretensis</HI> comments and glosses upon Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> wri|ting, and my story; and now what if my story of <HI>Nichols</HI> prove true, and and that in all the particular branches in it, where is <HI>Cretensis</HI> then? in what predicament will <HI>Cretensis,</HI> Mr. <HI>Burroughs,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Greenhil</HI> be found, and that tis certainly true, and hath been testified again and again, both to me and to many others, both Ministers and Citizens since my Book came forth, I desire the Reader to mark what follows. For the first part of the Story related by me <HI>pag.</HI> 78. concerning one <HI>Ni|chols</HI> coming into <HI>Stepny</HI> Parish, and to Mr. <HI>Greenhils</HI> face justifying those wicked Opinions there set down, as that <HI>God was the Author of all sin, &amp;c.</HI> (yea maintaining more then I have particularly mentioned in <HI>pag.</HI> 78. namely, <HI>That children owe no obedience to their Parents except they be godly</HI>) 'tis most certainly true, and Mr. <HI>Greenhil</HI> dares not deny it; and for proof of it, Mr. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">This Mr. <HI>Randal</HI> is known well to many godly persons, and is a godly man, a Schoole-master about <HI>Stepny,</HI> and a Minister also, not that <HI>Randal</HI> the <HI>Antinomian</HI> and <HI>Famili<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Randal</HI> an eare and eye witnesse related it to me, and
<PB N="72" REF="85">
to others, yea since <HI>Cretensis</HI> Book came forth that denies the truth of this story; I have asked Mr. <HI>Randal</HI> of it, and he affirms it to be undeniably true; and for to evince the truth of it, Mr. <HI>Randal</HI> told me these circum|stances, <HI>viz.</HI> who were present when <HI>Nichols</HI> did maintain these opinions to Mr. <HI>Greenhil,</HI> namely, besides himself one <HI>Oates</HI> a Carpenter, and divers women; as also Mr. <HI>Greenhil</HI> could not stay long with this <HI>Nichols,</HI> being to go forth to some place where he had appointed to come, and should be staid for; so that thus far the story is without all question true, and I am confident Mr. <HI>Greenhil</HI> upon new consideration and rubbing up his memory, will speak no more such words to Mr. <HI>Burroughs,</HI> as to wonder to see such a thing as this in Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> Book, and that he knows of no such meeting. Now for the second part of the story, namely that at a meeting where Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> was present, with divers others, Mr. <HI>Greenhil</HI> did relate unto his Brother <HI>Burroughs</HI> this sad story of <HI>Nichols</HI> venting these opinions fore-mentioned, and upon that, how all the Discourse following related by me in this story of <HI>Nichols, page</HI> 79. yea more passed between Mr. <HI>Greenhil</HI> and Mr. <HI>Burroughs,</HI> is as certain as the first; and for proof of it one Mr. <HI>Allen</HI> of <HI>Stepny Parish,</HI> a godly understanding man who was upon the place, and heard all, related it to divers in Mr. <HI>Bellamies</HI> shop in my hearing, of whom after he had made an end of speaking to the company, I enquired more per|fectly how he knew all this to be true, and whether he was an ear witnesse, and got him to name over the opinions again, and to repeat other passages to me for the help of my memory, and for fear lest I should mistake the relation, so soon as Mr. <HI>Allen</HI> had done, I went immediatly home, and writ down in my Diary the whole businesse from first to last, with the day of the moneth, the place, and persons, when, where, and to whom also besides my self it was told: And further then all this, since my Book came forth, and <HI>Cre|tensis</HI> Answer to it, though this story is branded by <HI>Cretensis to have particu|lar forgeries in it, numerous beyond measure,</HI> and all <HI>Nichols</HI> Opinions related by Mr. <HI>Greenhil</HI> to Mr. <HI>Burroughs,</HI> with divers passages mentioned by me to come from Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> at that meeting, all affirmed to be false, yet Mr. <HI>Allen</HI> (before ever I spoke one word with him coming into Mr. <HI>Bellamies</HI> shop accidentally, where when he came in some company were speaking of <HI>Cretensis</HI> Answer to my Book, and of this very passage of Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> under his hand brought by <HI>Cretensis</HI> to disprove that story) of his own ac|cord justified the story of <HI>Nichols</HI> coming to Mr. <HI>Greenhil</HI> and Mr. <HI>Greenhils</HI> relating it to Mr. <HI>Burroughs,</HI> with all the discourse following upon it, saying I am the man that told it Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> and that in this shop, and Mr. <HI>Greenhil</HI> and Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> dare not deny it; for the story (saith Mr. <HI>Allen</HI>) is most certainly true, and all the mistake is of those words <HI>a meeting con|cluded
<PB N="73" REF="85">
of,</HI> where Mr. <HI>Greenhil</HI> should relate these Opinions, whereas the making known of those Opinions and the Discourse upon occasion of them was not at a set meeting on purpose appointed for that occasion, but at a usual meeting on the Lords day after Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> his preaching in the morning, where at Colonel <HI>Zacharies</HI> house Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> Mr. <HI>Greenhil</HI> and divers godly persons use to meet; and as Mr. <HI>Allen</HI> said this in the pre|sence and hearing of three godly Ministers and divers Citizens, so hath he (as I am certainly informed) drawn up with his own hand for the Presse a Narration of this story of <HI>Nichols,</HI> maintaining those opinions to Mr. <HI>Greenhil,</HI> and of Mr. <HI>Greenhils</HI> reporting the Opinions to Mr. <HI>Burroughs,</HI> with all their discourses thereupon, yea more fully and particularly then I have in <HI>Gangraena,</HI> so that tis strange to me that Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> should dare to give such a writing under his hand to <HI>Cretensis,</HI> as to say <HI>that story Mr.</HI> Edwards <HI>hath page</HI> 79. <HI>of one Nichols &amp;c. is all false,</HI> when as the whole story and all the particulars of it are true, and there is nothing false in the story from first to last; only there is a mistake in the transition from the first part of the story to the second, and in the passing from the first meeting to the second (which in strict acception of words is no part of the story nor of the matters contained in it) namely in those words <HI>of a meeting concluded of,</HI> which implies a set meeting occasioned upon those opinions, whereas the second meeting at which Mr. <HI>Greenhil</HI> declared these opinions of <HI>Nichols,</HI> and all those speeches passed between them, was not on purpose about <HI>Ni|chols</HI> and his opinions, but a meeting where constantly on the Sabbath day mornings after Sermon, Mr. <HI>Burroughs,</HI> Mr. <HI>Greenhil,</HI> and divers private Christians using to come, Mr. <HI>Greenhil</HI> took occasion to speak of this <HI>Nichols</HI> opinions. Now I desire the Reader to consider Mr. <HI>Allen</HI> relating to me the first meeting where Mr. <HI>Greenhil</HI> was without Mr. <HI>Burroughs,</HI> with the opinions vented then, and telling me there was a second meeting presently after that, where, upon occasion of a former meeting and opinions then maintained, Mr. <HI>Greenhil</HI> related the opinions, and all that discourse above mentioned, passed, but not acquainting me with the nature of the second meeting, <HI>viz.</HI> that it was of course every week after Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> morning Sermon, whether I might not well conclude (and cannot easily conceive how I could understand it otherwise) the second meeting to be oc|casioned by the first, as well as the second Relation followed upon occasion of the first; and though it were not just so, <HI>viz.</HI> a set meeting to that end, where all I set down in <HI>Gangraena</HI> was spoken, but an ordinary meeting where M. <HI>Greenhil</HI> took the occasion to declare as abovesaid, whether this mistake be a matter to be so much made of as to be branded with forgery, falsenesse, or for me to be cryed out of for telling a story having particular forgeries in it,
<PB N="74" REF="86">
numerous beyond measure, when as the circumstance wherein the mistake lies, is no repoach, or c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lumny, but in <HI>favorem &amp; honorem</HI>; and I appeal to the Reader whether if the story had been in that particular circumstance according as I set it down, <HI>a meeting concluded of,</HI> it had not been more for the honour of Mr. <HI>Greenhil</HI> and Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> to have made a solemn businesse of it by appointing a set meeting to have advised what to have done in this sad case, and such like, then only at an ordinary meeting on another occasion by the by to speak and discourse of it. But before I passe from this, I shall lay down four things. First discover and lay open the equivocations and mental reservations of Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> and Mr. <HI>Greenhil</HI> given in to <HI>Cretensis</HI> in writing. Secondly, Mr. <HI>Greenhils</HI> and Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> plain untruths which cannot be salved, no not by equivocations. Thirdly inquire into what may be the reasons moving and inducing them thus to do. Fourthly, commend something to the Readers consideration and observation from all this Discourse.</P>

The Reader may here observe the fallacies and equivocations of Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> and Mr. <HI>Greenhil</HI>; Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> gives a writing under his hand to <HI>Cretensis</HI> concerning the story Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> hath <HI>page</HI> 79. of one <HI>Nichols and a meeting concluded of, &amp;c.</HI> saying 'tis <HI>all false</HI>; Now who is there that reads these lines given under Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> his hand but conceives that Master <HI>Burroughs</HI> brands this whose story of <HI>Nichols</HI> of forge|ry, as if there never had been any such man, nor any such opinions maintain|ed by him, nor Mr. <HI>Greenhil</HI> and <HI>Nichols</HI> had never met, nor Mr. <HI>Green|hil</HI> had never at any meeting declared to Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> and others any such opinions, nor never any such discourse in reference to those opinions had passed between Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> and Mr. <HI>Greenhil,</HI> as is set down by me; This is the English and common construction which all people (who beleeve Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI>) make of this writing, crying out, O what a lyer is is Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> and what a lying Book is <HI>Gangraena</HI>! yea we see <HI>Cretensis</HI> himself, the profound Oracle of the Sectaries takes Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> meaning thus, as the Reader may perceive by his commentary upon the writing, ren|dring from thence this story of <HI>Nichols</HI> related by me, so to the world as if it were all forged, and a meer fained thing, going over most of the particulars in this story one after another in his scoffing way, damning each part of it as false, and then passing his sentence upon the whole together in these words: <HI>This story is long, and the particular forgeries in it numerous, beyond measure</HI>; and all <HI>Cretensis</HI> grounds upon, is Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> writing which he received from him; desiring <HI>the Reader to make the computation, which he may do with exactnesse enough if he shall please to compare Mr.</HI> Edwards <HI>Relation with these ensuing lines which he received from Mr.</HI> Burroughs
<PB N="75" REF="86">
<HI>himself in writing, anent this businesse.</HI> Thus Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> gives a writing under his hand so couched and drawn up, making use also of Mr. <HI>Greenhils</HI> testimony to strengthen it, that all may take it, and many do, as if the story related by me were false; but doth Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> think, or believe so of this story as his words carry it? no, he knows in his conscience the contrary, only he writes thus to <HI>Cretensis</HI> for the present, because it will serve his design, and if his fallacies shall happen to be discovered, he hath so placed his words that he will have a back door to come out at, he hath all along so framed and penned his writing, that though it carry in the face of it another meaning, yet upon two or three words placed artificially he thinks to come off, and salve his credit from being branded a lyer under his own hand, and that is from putting all he sayes upon those words <HI>a meeting concluded of</HI>; which words <HI>meeting</HI> and <HI>such</HI> are several times used by him, (each of them six times a peece) and brought in at every turn and corner to salve him, all the weight of his testimony still referring to the words, <HI>meeting, and such, such meeting, such a man, &amp;c.</HI> which the Reader may easily perceive: So that Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> equivocation lies thus, he puts all the story upon <HI>a meeting concluded of,</HI> and speaks of the whole story still as upon <HI>such a meeting.</HI> Now there being no set meeting on purpose for those Opinions, but the meeting where these Opinions were declared by Mr. <HI>Greenhil</HI> an ordinary usual meeting, he thereupon in those lines given to <HI>Cretensis,</HI> doth not only conceal what he knew, but denies the whole story all along, such a man, such opinions; such passages, related, &amp;c. carrying the matter so as if the whole story had been false, because one circumstance in the manner of the narration of it was mistaken, and this is his evasion fra|med with much art, and studied on purpose to deceive the Reader.</P>
<P>The second equivocation and evasion at which Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> thinks to come out at to salve himself, and yet impeach my story of falshood is this, <HI>that he never knew such a man as</HI> Nichols, <HI>nor ever was at any meeting with him, neither did he ever hear of his name, or that there was such a man in the world</HI>; which things have been alledged for him by some of his friends upon my affirming the truth of the story, and that I should prove it; Now granting all this to be true (though some part of it I much question) yet my story is not made false by this; <HI>Gangraena page</HI> 79. for I do not in my story of <HI>Nichols,</HI> charge Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> that he ever was at a meeting with <HI>Nichols,</HI> or ever saw his face, only I say Mr. <HI>Greenhil</HI> and he met (which is most true) and therefore Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> confounds meetings, jumbles two into one, which I make in my Relation distinct, on purpose for an eva|sion; neither of the second meeting (which I speak of) where Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> was with Mr. <HI>Greenhil,</HI> do I say <HI>Nichols</HI> was there, but rather the contrary, lay|ing
<PB N="76" REF="87">
down that Mr. <HI>Greenhil</HI> related to Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> and others, what had been vented by <HI>Nichols</HI> a few dayes before; and now I appeal to the Reader whether this be ingenuous fair dealing to deceive the Reader thus, by casting the aspersion of falsenesse upon a true story, and yet to keep a reserve to come off with in case of being chalenged? or rather whether is not this Jesuitical equivocation, and whether any Jesuite could, or would have drawn up half a score line<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fuller of equivocations, reservations, and double expressions then Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> hath in these few lines: I am of the mind this Manuscript of Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> discovers his jugling and indirect walk|ing between the two meetings, that where Master <HI>Greenhil</HI> was without Master <HI>Burroughs,</HI> and that where both of them were, that of <HI>a meeting con|cluded of, such a meeting,</HI> and an ordinary usual meeting, more then <HI>Cretensis</HI> Ma|nuscript will do my <HI>jugling and indirect walking between the two Towns of</HI> Godalming <HI>in</HI> Surry <HI>and</HI> Dunmow <HI>in</HI> Essex; but to make an end of Master <HI>Burroughs</HI> equivocations, I wish Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> to think often of that in <HI>Iames,</HI> cap 1.8. <HI>A double minded man is unstable in all his wayes,</HI> which hath been often in my mind of him, he of all the Apologists in many things seem|ing to come neer us, even as if he were ours, and then flying off again; I could mind him of divers passages, both in the Assembly and out of the Assembly, in his Sermons, and Conferences, wherein he of all the rest hath most yeelded, inclined to us for a fit, and yet at other times none st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ffer nor fiercer then he.</P>
<P N="2">2. As in Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> writing to <HI>Cretensis,</HI> I have shown plain equivo|cations, so there will be found in it manifest falsity, and some passages that cannot be salved from lying, no not by the help of an equivocation; as for instance, Master <HI>Burroughs</HI> speaks as of the whole together, <HI>that story of Ni|chols,</HI> not a part of the story, and saith&punc; <HI>all is false,</HI> which is an apparent untruth, for though some part of it were false, yet if any of it were true (especially the major part) it cannot be affirmed all is false, and then though in some parts of it Master <HI>Burroughs</HI> may equivocate, yet in others he cannot; as for instance, the first part of the story wherein is laid down <HI>Nichols</HI> maintaining to Mr. <HI>Greenhils</HI> face those wicked opinions, is a part of the story of <HI>Nichols</HI> and undoubtedly true, how then can that be said to be false? besides it pre|cedes those words expressed in <HI>Gangraena, a meeting concluded of,</HI> upon which Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> evades, and so cannot be salved by having a reference to them, and yet this is the first and one great part of that story Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> hath of one <HI>Nichols</HI>; how then can Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> words, <HI>viz.</HI> of affirming that story Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> hath of one <HI>Nichols,</HI> to be false, be in any sense justified to be true? again, how can Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> say <HI>he never heard there was such a man in the world as Nichols,</HI> when as it cannot be thought but that Master <HI>Greenhill</HI> named him to him at Colonel <HI>Zacha|ries</HI>
<PB N="77" REF="87">
house? and that Master <HI>Burroughs</HI> should never hear of <HI>Nichols</HI> name, Mr. <HI>Greenhil</HI> and Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> being so familiar, and Mr. <HI>Greenhil</HI> rela|ting to him the opinions, that Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> should never aske the mans name who held such vile opinions, nor Mr. <HI>Greenhil</HI> never speak of his name, seems to me very strange; and if so, how came Master <HI>Allen</HI> to hear and know that the opinions related to Master <HI>Burroughs,</HI> were one <HI>Nichols</HI> opinions, seeing Mr. <HI>Allen</HI> was not at the first meeting where <HI>Nichols</HI> was with Mr. <HI>Greenhil,</HI> but only at this second meeting where Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> was? again how can Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> give it under his hand, <HI>that he to this day never knew of any of</HI> Nichols <HI>his opinions,</HI> when as the opinions of <HI>Nichols</HI> laid down by me in the story of <HI>Nichols,</HI> were told him by Mr. <HI>Greenhil,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> thereupon was so affected, that all those speeches fell from him, about the necessi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y of a Government, and power in the Magistrate, and that over conscience, &amp;c. Lastly, for those two or three last lines of Mr. <HI>Burroughs,</HI> namely Mr. <HI>Greenhils</HI> asking him whe|ther he knew of any such meeting with that <HI>Nichols</HI>; this being spoken of in reference to the story of <HI>Nichols</HI> set down by me in <HI>Gangraena,</HI> that for his part he wondred to see such a thing in my Book, for he knew of no such meeting, how durst Mr. <HI>Greenhil</HI> say thus, and Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> give it under his hand to be printed to abuse the world thus; for did not Mr. <HI>Greenhil</HI> know of a meeting with <HI>Nichols,</HI> which I spoke of in my Book in the former part of this story of <HI>Nichols,</HI> where <HI>Nichols</HI> justified to his face these opinions, and which was the ground and occasion of all the discourse related by me in the second meeting? and yet Mr. <HI>Greenhils</HI> question to Mr. <HI>Burroughs,</HI> and his own answer to it here set down by <HI>Cretensis</HI> as from under Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> hand, are so set down that every Reader (who will believe them) believes and takes it for granted, that Mr. <HI>Greenhil</HI> no more then Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> ever knew such a man as this <HI>Nichols,</HI> nor never heard there was such a man in the world, till he read it in Mr. <HI>Edwrrds</HI> his Book, nor ever knew of any meeting about him, or any of his opinions; and so we see <HI>Cretensis</HI> (though an acute man) understands it so, and vapors exceedingly upon it.</P>
<P N="3">3. It may be demanded and asked what should be the cause, and what may be the reasons why Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> and Mr. <HI>Greenhil</HI> should thus conspire to|gether to give such a testimony in writing as this against the story of <HI>Nichols,</HI> which cannot b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t with all ingenuous men prejuduce them much, (the fallacy of it being once made known) as being at the best but a grosse equivo|cation, and a studied peece to deceive the Reader, especially considering that nothing I speak of in that story of <HI>Nichols</HI> was to the prejudice and disparagement of Mr. <HI>Greenhil</HI> and Mr. <HI>Burroughs,</HI> but much to their honour,
<PB N="78" REF="88">
as being at that time in so good a temper as to be affected with the evil of Er|rors, and wicked Opinions.</P>
<P>Now of this I conceive these three Reasons: First, Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> and Mr. <HI>Greenhils</HI> earnest and eager desire of taking all advantages, and opportu|nities to blemish me, and to render me a Lyar to the world, which that they might do, conceiving they had taken me tripping in a mistake (though no material one, nor nothing to their prejudice, and so no slander nor calumny, but making for their honour) they prosecute it, and improve it so far, that to make something of it (poor men) their ill-will and hatred against me, blind|ing and befooling them, leads them into Equivocations, mental Reservati|ons, and Untruths, even to the wounding of their own reputations amongst all unprejudiced men. Secondly, a Design thereby to blast my Book among the people, to render it odious, to cause the truth of all matters of fact in it to be suspected, and so to hinder the good intended by me in that Book: Now Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> and Mr. <HI>Greenhil</HI> having a great name among many people, being accounted for men of that way somewhat moderate and among the best of that party, they knowing that their testimony, and that in the mouth of two witnesses (both being joyned together in the writing printed by <HI>Cre|tensis</HI>) might wound my Book, and from thence many would take occasion to question all, therefore they catch at the least occasion to declare them|selves against my Book. Thirdly, they do it to free themselves from suspition and jealousie, which otherwise they might lye under from the other Secta|ries, as if they were against other Sects and Opinions, and for a Toleration of no other Sect but their own, and were for the Government of the Church to be setled in regard of these horrid Opinions and Heresies daily vented, and for the coercive power of the Magistrate against Sectaries, which these conferences upon occasion of <HI>Nichols</HI> Opinions seem to import, and might give some jealousie of, and therefore to clear themselves from these, and to ingratiate themselves to the Sectaries, and the Sectaries to them, to assure them they will stand by them against the Presbyterians; they greedily catch at the mistake of a circumstance, and thereupon Mr. <HI>Bur|roughs</HI> gives a writing under his hand, so couched and curiously drawn up&punc; as that all their fellow Sectaries cannot but take it as if they denyed the whole, and as if no such words had ever been spoken by them about Opinions, and the necessity of Government and power of the Magistrate. The Indepen|dents strictly so called, are a very few in comparison of the Anabaptists, An|tinomians, Libertines, &amp;c. a contemptible party as of themselves, Indepen|dents in Armies, Country, City, falling daily to Anabaptisme, &amp;c. and therfore Mr. <HI>Greenhil</HI> and Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> being afraid they might suffer by this story, take this occasion to clear themselves by sending this writing to <HI>Cretensis.</HI></P>

The Reader from this writing given under Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> hand to dis|prove one of my stories, together with <HI>Cretensis</HI> glorious vaporing inferen|ces upon it, may plainly see what to judge of my stories laid down in <HI>Gan|graena,</HI> and of <HI>Cretensis</HI> confutation, seeing <HI>Cretensis</HI> signal choisest proof, and that which among all the rest was the onely testimony that gave him some credit in the world, proves so weak and faulty, yea and at best but a meer juggle and equivocation: what may the Reader think of <HI>Cretensis</HI> Answers to other passages of my Book? his Testimonies being either from persons of no credit and worth, Apprentice boyes, Sectaries, and men in their own cause, or persons under bad report, as <HI>Cosens,</HI> against whom there have been many other complaints and depositions for miscariages and misdemeanors (as I am certainly informed) yea among others for abusing a worthy Member of the House of Commons, when as Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> testimony proves so invalid, and the whole story of <HI>Nichols</HI> (excepting onely one mistake in the transi|tion of it from one part to the other) proves all true, yea and more too then I have set down, as appears both by what I have sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d already, and from Mr. <HI>Allens</HI> printed Relation, being a man from whom I had the first Relation of this story: Now by this time I conceive that all men know what to judge of Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> Text, and <HI>Cretensis</HI> his Commentary and Application, and must conclude <HI>Cretensis</HI> had little reason to make such Tragical out-cryes, and a great noyse of branding this story of <HI>Nichols</HI> (as if there had never been any such man in the world, nor no such Opinion, held by any, nor ne|ver no such discourse between Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> and Mr. <HI>Greenhil</HI>) with <HI>parti|cular forgeries in it, numerous beyond measure.</HI> And for a conclusion of my Reply both to <HI>Cretensis</HI> and Master <HI>Burroughs</HI> writing&punc; I report thus upon <HI>Cretensis</HI> in his own words a little changed: That long formal story of one <HI>Nichols</HI> living about <HI>Moor-fields,</HI> coming into <HI>Stepney</HI> parish to draw away people: That to Mr. <HI>Greenhils</HI> face did justifie and maintain many wicked Opinions, &amp;c. upon occasion whereof at a meeting where Mr. <HI>Greenhil,</HI> Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> and many others were, which meeting was, <HI>viz.</HI> a little before Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> fell upon the preaching of the power of the Magistrate in matters of Religion, and the point of Toleration: At which meeting Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> and Mr. <HI>Greenhil,</HI> with others, spake many good words, particu|larly Mr. <HI>Burroughs,</HI> in regard of these things, matters being so, there was a necessity of the Government of the Church, and of the power of the Magi|strate, &amp;c.

<P>&sect;. 30. <HI>Cretensis</HI> thinking that by his Anabaptistical Letter he hath weak|ned my testimony of the Author, and branded him for a Malignant, he pro|ceeds in this Section against the master of the Letter, charging a great part of it to be notoriously false, as some things about <HI>Kiffin</HI> and <HI>Palmer,</HI> and of a woman to be Rebaptized, at which story, out of his love to Anabaptists and Dipping, not knowing how soon he shall fall to that way, he is so offended, that he makes the Tale of <HI>Gargantua</HI> and <HI>Donquixot,</HI> with his Wind-mills, to look like Gospels in comparison of it, and thereupon breaks out into a passion, that he saith, <HI>It is pity the Relator should either eat or drink, till he either hath proved the truth, or else confessed the untruth of it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> The Reader may observe <HI>Cretensis</HI> cannot deny some part of it to be true; and indeed the first part of it of one <HI>Web</HI> (the most material and foul for the Opinions and Blasphemies; <HI>Cretensis</HI> doth not so much as offer to dis|prove:) For those other about <HI>Kiffins</HI> bragging upon Disputation, and those lighter passages, I conceive Mr. <HI>Ricraft</HI> will clear in his Answer; but for the main businesse of <HI>Kiffin</HI> and <HI>Patience</HI> anointing with Oyl a sick woman, one of their members, that is not denied neither, only some words, which being re|covered, she should speak, which is not much material to the thing; besides, 'tis probable words to that effect were spoken, though not <HI>in terminis,</HI> where|in, may be, the equivocation stands: And lastly, for that story of the woman to be Rebaptized, and the Dipper which <HI>Cretensis</HI> makes such a quaint inven|tion and bold fiction, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as if no Anabaptist could be guilty of such one; I Reply to <HI>Cretensis,</HI> There are fouler things done by Anabaptists and Sectaries; Mistris <HI>Attaways</HI> story, with many particular passages in it are fouler, as I shall by Letters, and other Relations make manifest; but whereas <HI>Cretensis</HI> makes this Relation such a lye to the Wherstone, making all the daring Relations (as <HI>Cretensis</HI> phrases them) in <HI>Gangraena</HI> besides to give place to it, I will upon one condition (and that a very reasonable one) that <HI>Cretensis</HI> and his Church
<PB N="84" REF="91">
will promise upon proof of it to joyn in a Petition to the Parliament with the Presbyterians for the forbidding of all Dipping and Rebaptization, and ex|emplary punishment of all Dippers, as his Brother <HI>Kiffin, &amp;c.</HI> set down in my large Reply to <HI>Cretensis,</HI> the place where, the name of the Dipper, with other circumstances of this story; and I do believe, if my intelligence doth not ex|tremely sail me, whereas <HI>Cretensis</HI> makes such a wonder at one, I shall be able in my next to give instances in the plural number; and for this end I have ta|ken order to have sent me up with hands subscribed, the proof with particu|lar circumstances. And for conclusion of this, I cannot but take notice of the extreme cruelty of <HI>Cretensis</HI> against the Relator of this story (and by this we may see what liberty and favor Presbyterians must expect, if once we fall into the hands of Independents) <HI>That 'tis pity he should either eat or drink, till he hath proved the truth, or confessed the untruth of it.</HI> What <HI>Cretensis,</HI> no other way for a poor man who tells a story of an Anabaptistical Dipper, but to starve him to death, or to make him sin against conscience by confessing the untruth of that which he thinks in his conscience to be true; and that I may convince <HI>Cre|tensis</HI> of his rashnesse in speaking thus, I desire him in his Rejoynder to re|solve this case, which is the true case of this story: <HI>Suppose the person who can prove it lives sixty or seventy miles off, how long, and how many days will you allow the Relator to finde him out, and to bring him, with all other Witnesses be|fore the Magistrate to prove the truth of it; must not this of necessity require some days (though no accidents should fall out, sicknesse, or of being from home, &amp;c. which might retard it) and would you have the Relator all this while go so many days without eating or drinking?</HI> that were indeed the ready way for the Relator never to prove the truth of it: I suppose upon second thoughts <HI>Cretensis</HI> will con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">esse he writ this in a passion and flame, as I believe he did all the rest of his Book.</P>

<P><HI>Reply.</HI> Lieutenant Colonel <HI>Lilburns</HI> playing at Cards, I have proved true in Answer to <HI>Walwyn, pag.</HI> 30. where the Reader may by looking back be sa|tisfied; as for the rest I have said of him, when <HI>Cretensis</HI> goes about to dis|prove it, I shall as particularly make proof of it by instances; and I am of an opinion with <HI>Cretensis</HI> (though not in his sense) the other things instanced in
<PB N="85" REF="91">
as well as playing at Cards, are Grapes growing on the same Thorn; only I cannot but wonder at one fetch of <HI>Cretensis</HI> (indeed far fetcht) to salve the credit of his Brother <HI>Lilburn,</HI> That my reporting of <HI>Lilburns</HI> playing at Cards <HI>either is a false report it self, or at least a report of a report which is false, and so little better,</HI> which is to make all reports false of which a man is not an Ear and Eye-witnesse, and so nothing to be believed, though re|lated by never such credible Ear and Eye-witnesses: Now after this rate to be sure the story of <HI>Cretensis Presbyterian Angel</HI> which another hath to tell (some Independent Angel) is false, the story of the Presbyterians fish|ing on a day of Thanksgiving is false, and little to be regarded; for <HI>Cretensis</HI> sure was none of the Com&mdash; or Sub-Presbyters (though I am confident he would have fished with them a whole Afternoon upon a Thanksgiving day, on condition to have been a Com&mdash; or Sub-Presbyter with the Doctorate of the Assembly) The Manuscript of my jugling between <HI>Godal|ming</HI> and <HI>Dunmow,</HI> is either a false report it sell, or at least a report of a report which is false, and so all the stories which <HI>Cretensis</HI> threa|tens Presbyterians with to make their Names and Reputations so many dead corpses, will be but either false reports, or at least reports of reports which are false, and so little better, for I believe <HI>Cretensis</HI> comes little among Pres|byterians, and so cannot speak much of his own knowledge.</P>
<P>As for that particular of one of <HI>Lilburns</HI> eyes put out by a Pike in the street, upon which <HI>Cretensis</HI> makes jests, as that <HI>Lilburn</HI> is able to see and read twenty untruths and ten in Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> Book with the worst of them. I answer, this passage, as also that of two Children taken away at a time from <HI>Cretensis</HI> are not made any thing of by me, or insisted upon to upbraid them, but touched only to shew their own folly in rash censuring of Pres|byterians from acts of Gods Providence in afflicting, by giving instances in themselves: However, for the truth of the thing, <HI>Lilburns</HI> eye was so run into by a Pike immediately upon his Letter coming forth against Mr. <HI>Prynne</HI> and the Assembly, as that he could not see with it for a great while, and it was feared, and commonly reported, he would never see more with it; but for my part, I am glad to hear he can see again with it; and the recovery of his sight doth no whit infringe the truth of what I have written, I expres|sing not how long he could not see, speaking only of presently after his Let|ter came forth; but supposing his eye-sight to be as good as <HI>Cretensis</HI> ex|presses it, yet I am sure he cannot read twenty and ten untruths in <HI>Gangraena,</HI> and I suppose by this time the Reader by my Reply is well satisfied, that this speech of <HI>Cretensis</HI> is an untruth; and as for that jeer of <HI>Cretensis, That if I had not a great beam in my own eye, I might easily have seen that neither of</HI> Lilburns <HI>eyes are put out:</HI> I Reply, that lately in <HI>Westminster</HI> Hall I
<PB N="86" REF="92">
walked by Leiut: Col: <HI>Lilburn,</HI> and eyed him well, and could easily see a great blemish in one of his eyes which was not in the other, and so visible, that many a one in whose eye lesse is seen, yet cannot see at all; and I am of the minde, if <HI>Cretensis</HI> do but put on his Spectacles, he may see a great blemish in the eye, upon occasion of the Pike running in; but for my part, the greatest hurt I wish to Lieut: Col: <HI>Lilburn</HI> is, that he may not lose the eye of his soul in the wayes of Error, Schism, contempt of the Ministery, dispi|sing of Dominion, and speaking evil of Dignities, yes, my earnest prayer to God for him, <HI>Cretensis</HI> and other of their Brethren is, That God would anoint their eyes with eye-salve that they might see and be ashamed, and re|turn. Lastly, for <HI>Thomas Moor</HI> a great Sectary, and manifestarian that hath done much hurt in <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> which <HI>Cretensis</HI> denies, by saying he doth not more believe there is any such man, then he does that there is any woman-Preacher at <HI>Brasteed</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> &amp;c. and he believes me to be the greatest Mani|festarian under Heaven, there being no man that hath manifested that weak|nesse of judgement, that strength of malice against the Saints that I have done. I Reply, first the Reader may do well to take special notice of the bold impudency of <HI>Cretensis,</HI> who dares deny any thing if it may make for the Secta|ries; and 'tis no wonder he denies many other things in <HI>Gangraena,</HI> calling them lies, forgeries, when as he will dare to write thus, and to deny that which is known to many hundreds, and to persons of all ranks, Ministers, Gen|tlemen, Citizens, Souldiers. This <HI>Thomas Moor</HI> does much hurt in Lincoln|shire, some parts of Norfolk, Cambridgeshire; he is famous at <HI>Boston, Lynne, Holland</HI>; followed and accompanied somtimes from place to place, with many attending him; and I cannot think but <HI>Cretensis</HI> hath heard of him, and that he hath some Equivocation in his words or evasions, as it may be upon the word Sectary, <HI>Cretensis</HI> not judging any of his Saints Sectaries; or upon great Sectary, as those words seem to imply, <HI>A Sectary of that magnitude which he imports</HI>; or else upon those words, That hath done much mischief, <HI>Cretensis</HI> not believing that any of his Saints can do much mischief; and truly <HI>Cretensis</HI> may with as much truth deny there is any such man as Master <HI>Hugh Peters,</HI> as deny what I have written of <HI>Thomas Moor</HI>; and that there is such a one, I have seen, and have by me at this time writings of his to the quantity of almost twenty sheets, for his Opinions, written by <HI>Thomas Moor</HI> himself, subscribed with his Name, to a worthy and learned Member of the Assembly: As also this <HI>Thomas Moor,</HI> since these Wars, was questioned and committed by the then Governor of <HI>Boston</HI> Colonel <HI>King,</HI> for keeping an unlawful Conventicle at an unseasonable time in the night in the Garri|son Town of <HI>Boston,</HI> and for abusing and mis-calling the Governor when he was brought before him about it. Secondly, as for that jeer, <HI>There is no
<PB N="87" REF="92">
more any such man then such a woman at</HI> Brasteed <HI>in</HI> Kent, let <HI>Cretensis</HI> know for all Master <HI>Saltmashes</HI> bold affirmation in his late Book, <HI>that the contrary is known to himself and all the Town,</HI> there is such a woman who Preaches often both at <HI>Brasteed</HI> and other Towns thereabouts; and besides what the Reader in justification of this may finde in this Book, <HI>p.</HI> 24, 25. I shall adde this as a farther proof related to me lately by two godly Ministers of <HI>Kent,</HI> which is as follows. Upon Mr. <HI>Saltmarshes</HI> Book call'd <HI>Groans for Liberty,</HI> coming forth, and denying there was any such woman, who Preached at <HI>Brasteed,</HI> ma|ny of the godly Ministers of <HI>Kent</HI> in that part of <HI>Kent</HI> about Town <HI>Mauling</HI> at a meeting of theirs, took it in consideration to enquire and finde out the truth of that related in <HI>Gangraena,</HI> but denied by Mr. <HI>Saltmarsh,</HI> and entreated particularly a Minister on Mr. <HI>T.</HI> born in those parts neer <HI>Brasteed,</HI> knowing the Town, and the people thereabouts, to make it his businesse so to search into it, as that the certain knowledge of it might be reported to them at their next meeting, that accordingly it might be communicated to me for the further clearing of the truth. Mr. <HI>T.</HI> willingly accepted of the Motion of his Bre|thren, and accordingly did act in the businesse, and at the next meeting satis|fied the rest of the Ministers, that he had found out there was such a Preach|ing woman an Anabaptist, who somtimes at <HI>Brasteed,</HI> and other times at <HI>We|strum,</HI> a Town neer <HI>Brasteed,</HI> doth meet other women, and after she hath Preached, she takes the Bible and chuses a Text, some Verses in a Chapter, or somtimes a whole Chapter, and expounds and applies to her Auditors; and Mr. <HI>T.</HI> the Minister, who returned this relation to the Minister, knows this woman, and knows this to be so. One of those two Ministers who ac|quainted me with this, being entreated to give it me under his hand, hath un|der his hand given it me, which I keep by me to produce upon any occasion; so that the Reader may see both the one and the other, <HI>Thomas Moor</HI> the Se|ctary, and a woman Preacher at <HI>Brasteed,</HI> and both true, notwithstanding <HI>Cretensis</HI> will not believe them, but makes a jeer and scoff at these as he doth at all other things. Thirdly, to that bitter, uncharitable, unchristian expres|sion of <HI>Cretensis</HI> concerning me, that I am the greatest Manifestarian under Heaven; <HI>There is no man hath manifested that weaknesse of judgement, that strength of malice against the Saints which he hath done.</HI> I would have <HI>Creten|sis</HI> know, if I would give leave to my pen, I could upon these words whip him so as to fetch blood in abundance from him, but I will not write a Satyr, all I will say (though this is a desperate provoking speech, and I have much ado to forbear) is this, I dare appeal to the indifferent Reader, Whether Mr. <HI>Ed|wards</HI> or Mr. <HI>Goodwin</HI> in their writings against Independents, and against Presbyterians, have manifested more weaknesse of judgement, and strength of malice against the Saints: And to satisfie the Reader and my self, I desire
<PB N="88" REF="93">
<HI>Cretensis</HI> in his Rejoynder to shew where in any of my Books I have mani|fested that weaknesse of judgement, to declare to all the world as <HI>Cretensis</HI> hath done) that (I put out an Answer to a Book of which I never read one quar|ter of it; or writ a Book, wherein the far greatest part of the particulars were observed by ot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ers; or had neither leasure nor opportunity to search to the bottom all was storied, and yet notwithstanding deny all with Gyant-like confidence, <HI>Cr. p.</HI> 50. or where, in what pages of my Books, in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ituled, <HI>Reasons against Independent Government, Antapologia, Gangraena,</HI> I have discovered that strength of malice against the Independent Saints, as <HI>Cretensis</HI> in his Books call'd <HI>M. S. Theo-machia, Answers and Replyes to Mr.</HI> Prynne, <HI>A brief Answer to Mr.</HI> Edwards, hath against the Presbyterian Saints, and all the Reformed Churches. But no man need marvel at <HI>Cretensis</HI> course lan|guage, either in vilifying, slighting me, or in charging me so deeply, who con|siders how he hath spared none, of what condition or quality soever, that have come in his way, not regarding any mans age, calling, learning, holi|nesse, sufferings, place; witnesse his scornful bitter speeches against Mr. <HI>Wal|ker,</HI> Mr. <HI>Roborough,</HI> Dr. <HI>Steuart</HI>; yea, casting fire-brands of reproach upon City, Assembly, Parliament, and all Presbyterians, and particularly upon that worthy, learned, and religious Gentleman Mr. <HI>Prynne,</HI> the greatest and truest sufferer against those evils of that time, both for matter and manner, of any one man in <HI>England,</HI> whom above all others (notwithstanding all his sufferings, and other personal worth) he hath slighted, and desperately censured, as here he does me; which the Reader may finde in <HI>Cretensis</HI> Books against Mr. <HI>Prynne,</HI> and particularly in that Book Inti|tuled, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Calumny araigned and cast, Pag.</HI> 22, &amp; 17. I could prove (I say) by the Commission aforesaid, that Mr. <HI>Prynne</HI> hath done all these things, on purpose to despite the Spirit of God, to defame the Gospel, to make the ways of godlinesse and re|ligion hateful to the world, to encrease divisions, to multiply distractions, to bring a snare and evil day upon the Parliament, to expose the whole Kingdom to ruine and destruction.</NOTE> <HI>Calumny araigned and cast.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cretensis</HI> (&sect;. 33.49.) denies he holds any Errors in Justification great|er then I do, yea, or any so great by many degrees; and it will be a thou|sand times said, before once proved, that <HI>Cretensis</HI> holds any such Errors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He charges me also, in my Epistle Dedicatory, to abuse the Parliament with a loud untruth, That there are Eleven meetings at least of Sectaries in one Parish in this City: which loud untruth he charges not upon me alone, but upon the Honorable Court of Common-Councel, the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> calling them <HI>Brethren in iniquity</HI> with me. And fur|ther taxes me, that because the Pages of my Book are not large enough to contain my shamelesse untruths, therefore I quote them in the Margin of it, as of <HI>Overton</HI> and <HI>Eaton,</HI> and some of <HI>Cretensis</HI> Church reporting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="93"><HI>Reply. Cretensis</HI> hath been often charged to hold Errours in the point of Justification and the particulars have been specified and proved by many god|ly learned Ministers, both in Pulpits, writings, and con|ferences, as <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Master <HI>Walker,</HI> Master <HI>Robo|rough</HI> by wri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing; Master <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a|lamie</HI> in preaching.</NOTE> Master <HI>Walker,</HI> Master <HI>Roborough,</HI> Master <HI>Calamie, &amp;c.</HI> yea, some Independent Ministers, as Mr. <HI>Thomas Goodwin,</HI> Master <HI>Burton,</HI> &amp;c. have spoken against his Errours in the point of Justification, using sharp and quick expressions upon discoursing of them (as I can prove by good witnesses.) But for me, I was never taxed by any man, either Presbyterian or Independent, for holding any Errours in the doctrine of Justification: and indeed, I hold nothing in that point but which is commonly laid down in the Confession and Articles of Religion made by the Reformed Churches. And for the proving you guilty of Errour, Master <HI>Rob|rough</HI> hath done it cleerly and fully in his Animadversions and Examination of both parts of your Treatise of Justification (which, me thinks, you never ha|ving replyed unto, should not have had the forehead to have boasted thus.) Be|sides also, a godly orthodox learned Presbyt. of the Church of Scot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and hath fully answered you, and discovered your weaknesse, as one of the Reverend Commissioners of the Church of Scotland assured me upon his own know|ledge. Secondly, <HI>Cretensis</HI> shewes his impudencie and boldnesse in denying that which I prove by a Petition of the Honourable Court of Common Coun|cell, wherein they <HI>in terminis</HI> (as <HI>Cretensis</HI> cannot deny) affirm it; and I sup|pose, all men will iudge, such an Honourable Court affirming it, and that to the High Court of Parliament, is to be beleeved before one <HI>Cretensis.</HI> And of this businesse I know something, for I particularly inquired of some of that Committee appointed to draw up the Petition, and to make proof of things, how this particular was proved; and they told me, it was made apparent to the Committee of Common Councell, whereupon they put it in: and no wise man can conceive, that such a representative Body as the Common Councell, in a businesse wherein they knew they had so many eyes upon them, and so ma|ny enemies, (all the Sectaries mortally hating them for this, and other Petiti|ons) would represent such a thing to the Parliament, unlesse they could prove it. The Common Councell knowes very well, the Sectaries want not friends to possesse the Parliament against them, and who watch but for such an advan|tage, as to take them tripping, thereby to render all they present in this kinde as false: and if <HI>Cretensis,</HI> or any of his fellow Sectaries could have disproved this, 'tis a wonder to me they did not: When a Committee was appointed to hear, and the Citie to make proof of some of the foulest things mentioned in the Petition, why did not <HI>Cretensis,</HI> or some of his Church then, for the weakning the credit of the Common Councell, and the better bringing their
<PB N="90" REF="94">
preaching-sisters off, come in, and alledg this as a loud untruth? objecting, that by the same reason the story of the preaching women might be false. But how true soever 'tis, <HI>Cretensis</HI> hath a good faculty, in all things that are brought against the Sectaries, to beleeve nothing; but to be as confident as twice two makes four, that all is false. Well, though I will not be so uncharitable as <HI>Cretensis</HI> was, to wish Master <HI>Goodwin</HI> might neither eate nor drink till he had proved what he here writes: yet I heartily wish, that my Lord Major and the Honou|rable Court would not suffer <HI>Cretensis</HI> and his Church to meet any more in their Conventicle, till he had made good what he here writes; which, I con|ceive, they may the more lawfully and justly doe, because he doth not only give them the&mdash;, but calls them <HI>Brethren in iniquity</HI> with me,, scoffing at a say|ing of mine taken out of the City Petition, <HI>But this saying of his need not be melancholy for want of company; it hath brethren enough in the iniquity of it</HI>: and who are these brethren, but the Lord Major, Aldermen, and Common Coun|cell? O what an insolent bold passage is this! The Reader need not wonder at his foul mouth, and railing Dialect against me and my Book, who cares no more for this Honourable Citie: I doe not see how the Honourable Court of Common Councell can let it passe without questioning him, to suffer a man, who lives in the Citie under their Government, to abuse them thus in print. I am confident, if the Presbyterians lived in a Citie under a Magistracie and Go|vernment, where the Governers were Independent, and should have abused them thus, they would have made the Citie to hot for them. 3. As for that I say of <HI>Overton</HI> and <HI>Eaton,</HI> for all <HI>Cretensis</HI> mincing and shuffling, I shall free my self from uttering untruth; for <HI>Overton</HI> said, after a boasting manner, unto two sufficient witnesses, that <HI>now there was an answer to my Antapologie, and entred into the Hall-book</HI>; and they apprehend him so, especially one of them, as that he took order to send me word (I being then in the Country) that an answer was certainly printing; and for my greater assurance, he had searcht the book, and found it entred: so that I and many lookt every day for the coming of it forth; and I never knew before now, that books were entred into the Hall-book, but just when they were going to the Presse. For <HI>Eaton,</HI> an Indepen|dent Milliner, I do not affirm, that he spake the same words which <HI>Overton</HI> did, for his words were spoken many months before <HI>Overtons</HI>; only he is quoted in the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rgin as an instance to make good those words in the second page of my Preface, <HI>Their great words and threats of an Answer</HI>; which were these that he gave out, There was an Answer to my <HI>Antapologie,</HI> and he had seen it, and the Author of it had discovered me to be a poor weak man, and my Book a slight easie piece, neither good sense, nor good English, or words to that effect; which <HI>Eaton</HI> confessed he spake before witnesses, since my <HI>Gangraena</HI> came forth:
<PB N="91" REF="94">
that's all I say of him, or meant, and, I suppose, these are great words and threats of an Answer. Only by the way, I desire <HI>Cretensis</HI> to resolve me these questions, and then I will give him a good account why I called <HI>Eaton</HI> an In|dependent: namely, What was the true reason that <HI>Cretensis</HI> Reply to my <HI>An|tapologie,</HI> being entred in the Hall-Book in <HI>Iuly</HI> last, and given to the Book|seller to print, was not printed, but stopped? And how it came to passe, that <HI>Eaton,</HI> if he be no Independent, had the Reply to my <HI>Antapologie</HI> communi|cated to him to read and peruse? And when <HI>Cretensis</HI> hath resolved these que|stions, it may be, by the next, if he answer not truly, I shall tell him the rea|sons of the stop, and to whom else besides <HI>Eaton</HI> this Reply hath been com|municated, as to Master <HI>Sympson,</HI> and, may be, tell him what Master <HI>Overton,</HI> or his man, or both, have told a friend of mine, about the An|swer to my <HI>Antapologie</HI>; as namely, what the Licenser did upon perusing of it, and of the Title given to it about <HI>The Accuser of the Brethren cast, &amp;c.</HI> 4. As for the report of some of Master <HI>Iohn Goodwins</HI> Church, &amp;c. I observe <HI>Cretensis</HI> denyes it not, but puts it off with one of his usuall tricks, That he beleeves, I no more know it then declare it. And indeed, this is one of <HI>Cretensis</HI> jugling wayes which he makes often use of in this Book; when he knowes not what well to say, then he comes in with <HI>I beleeve, he no more knoweth, and I no more beleeve.</HI> (<HI>Cretens pag.</HI> 48, 49.) And truly, 'tis some|what strange to me, that he who is so hard of beliefe in divine things, that he will not beleeve the Scriptures without reason, and hath preached lately with much earnestnesse and violence, that Faith is not to guide Reason, but Reason Faith, will yet in humane things, beleeve any thing against all sense and reason. But to put <HI>Cretensis</HI> out of doubt, that I know, and can prove what I say, I offer <HI>Cretensis,</HI> upon promise made from him and his Church, that the honest men who told it out of their zeal to the cause, and their rejoycing in an Answer coming, and to perswade the Presbyterians to the truth of it (who have alwayes much doubted of an Answer to the <HI>Antapologie</HI>) shall not be cen|sured by the Church, nor looked upon with an evill eye, nor hundred by this from being taken into the preferment of being a Prophet, and preaching for <HI>Cretensis,</HI> I will name the Minister to whom it was told, and the members by whom; and for encouragement to <HI>Cretensis</HI> and his Church to make this pro|mise, I will for present name the first letter of the godly Ministers name, well acquainted with some of the Church, namely Master <HI>B.</HI></P>

goes over seven particulars, putting the <HI>lye</HI> upon each of them, concluding, <HI>there is scarce a clause of a sentence true in this Relation.</HI> And as all along upon each particular, so both in the entrance to this Answer, and in the close of it, he is full of jears, scoffs, and foul uncivill language.</P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> This story being the last of those related by me in <HI>Gangraena,</HI> which <HI>Cretensis</HI> excepts against in his Answer, and the story next unto that of <HI>Nichols</HI> and Master <HI>Burroughs,</HI> (if not more in some respects) which he most insults upon, and triumphs in, I have therefore reserved it to the later end, as being the last particular matter of fact I shall reply unto for the justification and vin|dication of my selfe against the foul-mouthd aspersions of <HI>Cretensis:</HI> And I shall first speak to the <HI>manner</HI> of his Answer and confutation of this Story, and secondly to the <HI>matter</HI> of it: But before I speak to either of these, I shall minde the Reader of that which I have often spoken of upon severall other particulars which I have replyed unto; namely, that hee must not look for all now that may be said, lest I anticipate my larger Reply; as also, because there is a Gentleman out of Town, whom I have expected almost this three weeks to come to London, who can tell mee some circumstances in this sto|ry for proofe of some things more fully and cleerly then the Minister from whom immediately I received it: And indeed, I am told, there is a mystery in some passages of this businesse about <HI>Cosens,</HI> which being unfolded, will give more full satisfaction in some particulars to the Reader, then yet I am able to doe. For the <HI>manner</HI> of <HI>Cretensis</HI> Answer, how unlike it is to a Mi|nister of the Gospel, and how like to one brought up in an Alehouse, or in a Bowling-alley, not onely on a day of publick Thanksgiving, but every day in the week, having their terms of art at his fingers ends, <HI>Score up, Tallie on,</HI> and such foul-mouthd language, <HI>'Tis a lie, You lie, A loud lie,</HI> every impar|tiall Reader cannot but take notice, and many speak openly of it; and that which makes <HI>Cretensis</HI> folly and insolencie the greater, and more to be bla|med by every indifferent Reader, is this, that he gives me the lie so often, in such a disgracefull, scornfull way, making the relation all over forgery, and that there are so many lies well nigh as words in the story; speaking also most confidently, though falsly, against the worthy Minister who told me this sto|rie, <HI>That hee Works stoutly at the forge, and feeds both himself and the world with all manner of scandals and falshoods against the Independents without fear,</HI> and in the close vapouring and triumphing at an excessive rate with inferences drawn from his own confutations, as if all hee had said in answer to me had been Gospel; when as all this high and great building is laid and raised solely upon the weak sandy foundation of <HI>Cosens</HI> his own relation; <HI>Cretensis</HI> dispro|ving the truth of my relation, and sealing the truth of his own Answer in
<PB N="93" REF="95">
seven particulars by no other way, but <HI>The man professeth</HI> (that is <HI>Cosens</HI>) <HI>that hee knowes no such man,</HI> and <HI>this counter information I had from the mouth of the said</HI> Cosens <HI>himselfe, and have the particulars under his hand.</HI> Now I ap|peal to all the world whether any wise man would ever have made such adoe as <HI>Cretensis</HI> doth here, giving the lye so oft, triumphing so confidently in a busi|nesse meerly upon the information of a man in his own case, and whether this be not worse then <HI>to ask my fellow whether I be a thief</HI>; (<HI>Cret. p.</HI> 11.) namely, to ask a mans selfe, and upon a mans owne testimony to call an honest man a thief, and to declare a thiefe an honest man; especially considering, besides <HI>Cosens</HI> being a party, and in his owne cause, hee is a man against whom there are many depositions, and complaints against him for other miscarriages and misdemeanours, a Copie whereof I am promised from a good hand, and shall insert in my large Reply: But supposing all that <HI>Cretensis</HI> saith <HI>Cosens</HI> told him should prove upon further inquiry to be true, and not false; (the contra|ry whereunto I shall presently make apparent) yet no wise man can excuse <HI>Cretensis</HI> of a great deal of weaknesse and folly, to put so much weight as hee doth upon such a testimony, and to declare so much to all the world: Certainly great <HI>Cretensis</HI> is the greatest Manifestarian that I have ever met with, and there is no man hath manifested that weaknesse of judgement, be|sides strength of malice against the Presbyterian Ministers and Saints which hee hath done both in this, and in many other passages of his Book; as to make an Answer to a Book, and professe truely he never read one quarter of the Book, &amp;c. and in my opinion these acts manifest greater weaknesse of judgement, farre more injudiciousnesse, then the not knowing <HI>how to range parts of speech in a sentence, nor to put the Nominative case and Verb together regularly in English,</HI> &amp;c. And for a conclusion of what I have to reply against the manner of <HI>Cretensis</HI> confutation of this story, I referre it to the judicious Readers consideration whether Master <HI>Edwards,</HI> for relating a story as a Re|lation, upon the information of a reverend godly Minister well known, living also upon the place, who could upon no reason be judged to do it out of partia|lity, or for sinister ends, be to be accounted a liar, and to have the <HI>lye</HI> often gi|ven him, or M. <HI>Goodwin</HI> for denying the whole story, and affirming the contrary upon the bare word and relation of a stranger, a great Sectary, and a party in the cause, who according to all reason cannot be thought but he will speak fa|vourably for himself, especially being such a one, as a man may, without breach of charity, presume he will speak any thing for himselfe in his own cause, when as hee did to mee in the presence and hearing of three godly Citizens al|ledge in his owne behalfe to cleer himself from all fault in this matter, that one of the witnesses who deposed, said, he was hired to swear against him, and had
<PB N="94" REF="96">
five shillings given him by one of the Justices, or some about him, and had three or foure cups of sack given him before he swore, and was drunk when he took his oath; unto whom some of the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>March</HI> 30. Three honest godly Citizens after supper comming to speak with me, as they were with me <HI>Cosens</HI> came to speak with me, and was brought into the room where these three Citizens were and I spake nothing to him nor he any thing to me, but in their hearing, who will testifie this and more.</NOTE> Citi|zens then present with me, replied, he had best take heed what he said to accuse the Justices of Peace, that they should make any witnesse drunck, or have any hand to give 5. s. to one to sweare against him, and that this was no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> likely, nor to be beleeved by any wise man; and I suppose if I should reply never a word more to what <HI>Cretensis</HI> hath objected against this story of <HI>Cosens,</HI> I had said enough to satisfie rationall men, by declaring I had my information from a person of worth, and by <HI>Cretensis</HI> nothing is here brought to infringe it, but only the parties own testimony, who is a man also otherwayes obnoxious, as I have already declared. Now from the manner I shall come to the matter; and for the Relation which I have set down of <HI>Cosens</HI> in the last leaf of my Book save one, I received it from a Reverend Minister who is Preacher at <HI>Rochester</HI> (the place where <HI>Cosens</HI> lives) and a Member of the Assembly, who told it me, and a Common Counsell man of this City, and I writ it from this Ministers mouth that I might neither forget nor mistake it, and read it to him after I had done, and upon reading, he approved it as his sense, and that which he had related. But now supposing there should be any mistakes in the first re|lation made to this godly and learned Minister, yet I reporting it just as I had it from his mouth (he being a man to be beleeved) and as an information only, not as a thing of my own knowledge, I conceive I cannot be taxed for a lyar, not according to any acception or definition of a lye; and if I be in this kinde to be blamed for lying, I desire to know of Master <HI>Goodwin</HI> by the next in case hee have reported from <HI>Cosens</HI> a Sectary, a loose person, a man speaking in his own cause, any thing that is untrue, (which that he hath done I shall infallibly prove) how he will free himself from the same crime, and not more justly incurre the title of great Master <HI>Cretensis,</HI> then I the brand of lying, which he so liberally bestowes upon me. But to come to the particulars, for the first words that <HI>Co|sens</HI> should say, <HI>Iesus Christ was a Bastard</HI>: 'tis confessed by him who related it (though he had it from a very good hand) that those words are not found in the deposition againg him before two Justices) but these, <HI>Christ (alas) he was a child, and you must not beleeve all the words hee said</HI>; and for the fuller satis|faction of the Reader, I do here set down the Information and Deposition to tittle as it was taken before the Major of <HI>Rochester,</HI> and another Justice of Peace.</P>

<P>Now I appeale to the Reader whether these words related in this Depositi|on, be not Blasphemy as well as the other, and whether a mistake might not ea|sily arise from these words deposed, to report the other; but to put <HI>Cretensis</HI> out of doubt that 'tis no lye, nor forgery to report such words, yea and more of some Sectaries, <HI>Cretensis</HI> Saints, and therefore he needed not to have triumphed so much in it: I will give him two instances of Sectaries, who have blasphem|ed after this manner. The first is one <HI>Coleburne</HI> of Watford in the liberty of Saint <HI>Albons,</HI> a great Anabaptist and Sectarie, who spake these words, that our Saviour Christ was a bastard, and the first time that he taught was in a tub up|on the sea. This was found by a Jury upon oath, and was returned into the Kings Bench by Certiorarie, in Michaelmas Terme last. The second is one in Midlesex, who is indited at the Kings Bench, for saying that our Saviour Christ was a bastard, and the Virgin Mary a &mdash; with many other blasphemous words, which (being so horrid and filthy) I think not fit to make publike: This is found by the grand Inquest in Candlemas Terme last, upon the know|ledge of one of the said grand Inquest; and to assure the Reader of what I write, I have by me the whole Processe and particulars at large, which I fetched out of the Crowne Office, subscribed with the Clarks hand, which be|cause they are so large, and I have much exceeded the number of sheets I alot|ted to this Reply, I forbeare to Print them; but if <HI>Cretensis</HI> doubt of the truth of what I here write, he may if he will be at the charge, have the whole pro|ceedings
<PB N="96" REF="97">
out of the Crown Office attested under hand. And for <HI>Cosens</HI> speak|ing these very words,
<HI>Cretensis</HI> a little after (thoug here he denies them) yet confesses these words were charged upon him; though upon examination wa|ved; else what meanes that passage of <HI>Cretensis,</HI> <Q>the witnesse upon whose single testimony (originally) both these and the former words were charged upon him:</Q>
Now what those former words were, I desire <HI>Cretensis</HI> to resolve in his Rejoynder.</P>
<P><Q>For the second, that if Jesus Christ were upon the Earth again, hee would be ashamed of many things he then did.</Q>
This second part of the Relation of the Information <HI>Cretensis</HI> calls <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a lye, and the second in order, and thereupon enlarges himself after this manner.
<Q>For neither did the man (namely <HI>Cosens</HI>) speak any such words as these, the witnesse upon whose single testimony (ori|ginally) both these and the former words were charged upon him, upon rexa|mination, and that upon oath before the Committee of the County, waved both the one and the other, as appeares by the said examination under the hand of the Clark of the said Committee, which I saw and read; and is forth com|ming for any man to peruse for his further satisfaction.</Q>
Now that the Reader may see what <HI>Cretensis</HI> confidence and impudencie is, and that <HI>Cosens</HI> spake such words as these, I desire him to read what followes to a word, taken out of the originalls, kept in the Majors Court of Rochester.</P>

<HI>as it appears by the said examination under the hand of the Clerk of the said Committee, which I saw and read;</HI>

<P>Now I desire the Reader but to compare this Examination under the hand of the Clerk of the Committee with what <HI>Cretensis</HI> hath written anent his busi|nesse, and he will finde <HI>Cretensis</HI> lines brought to clear <HI>Cosens</HI> from speaking
<PB N="99" REF="98">
these words, to have forgeries in it, numerous beyond measure, the whole and every part of it being nothing but lies; and for the further conviction of <HI>Cre|tensis,</HI> I will go over his words. 1. <HI>Cretensis</HI> saith, <HI>neither did the man speak any such words as these. Cretensis,</HI> how dare you say so, when as before three Justices of Peace upon oath these words were deposed against him? is your negative te|stimony without oath sufficient to disprove it? 2. <HI>Cretensis</HI> affirms for proof of his words, that <HI>Cosens</HI> never spake such words as these, that the witnesse upon whose single testimony (originally) both these and the former words were char|ged upon him upon re-examination, and that upon oath before the Committee of the County, waved both the one and the other, which is all stark staring false; and <HI>Cretensis</HI> proof failing him, what is <HI>Cretensis</HI> testimony worth? Now if the Reader do but read this Examination under the Clerk of the Committees hand, and compare with that the first Deposition of <HI>Francis Tillet</HI> before the Major of <HI>Rochester</HI> and two other Justices, he must presently see it smels above ground, and that here <HI>Cretensis</HI> words takes place in himself, <HI>quot verba, tot mendacia</HI>: I desire the Reader to tell the untruths, and that proved upon Record, and not untruths made upon my saying they are lies as <HI>Cretensis</HI> are upon his bare words.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Cretensis</HI> avoucheth confidently that it was one witnesse upon whose sin|gle testimony (originally) both these and the former words were charged up|on him: let this be the first lie in this Catalogue, for 'tis evident by the Deposi|tions which I have set down, that there were two witnesses, <HI>Iohn Cosens</HI> and <HI>Francis Tillet; Francis Tillet</HI> who swore <HI>Cosens</HI> spake these words, and <HI>Iohn Co|sens</HI> who deposed the other words; so that there were two witnesses, and each witnesse deposed not the same, but different words.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Cretensis</HI> here affirms the former words, namely, <HI>that Iesus Christ was a Bastard,</HI> were charged upon him; which if they were, and that upon oath, that was a good ground for the report; but if they were not charged upon him, but other blasphemous words, then <HI>Cretensis</HI> tels another phib, which is the second in order.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Cretensis</HI> positively (without saying I was so informed, &amp;c.) asserts that these words spoken, <HI>viz.</HI> by <HI>Cosens, If Christ were upon the earth again he would be ashamed, &amp;c.</HI> the witnesse upon re-examination, and that upon oath before the Committee of the County waved them: Now how false this is, let but the Reader compare the first and second Deposition of <HI>Francis Tillet,</HI> who deposed these words against <HI>Cosens,</HI> before three Justices, and upon re-exami|nation, and that upon oath before the Committee of the County swore the same again the second time, and was far from waving it as appears by the exa|mination under the Clerks hand of the Committee which I have set down; and
<PB N="100" REF="99">
now I might say to the Reader, <HI>keep tale,</HI> this is the third down-right fall, more then a stumble, this is a big lye with others in the belly of it; for first the former words were not charged upon <HI>Cosens</HI> by <HI>Francis Tillet,</HI> but only these words; and therefore how could he be re-examined upon that of which he never in|formed, nor was formerly examined? Secondly, much lesse then could he up|on oath wave them; and for the other words which he was re-examined up|on, he stood to them before the Committee, and is ready to testifie them still whensoever he shall be called thereunto.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Cretensis</HI> affirms that he who deposed these words, <HI>viz. That if Christ were upon the earth again, &amp;c.</HI>) did upon re-examination before the Committee wave them, as appears by the said examination under the hand of the Clerk of the said Committee. Now I might here say, <HI>score up</HI>; this is the fourth word of folly in <HI>Cretensis</HI> confutation; for there is no such examination under the hand of the Clerk of the said Committee, but the contrary to it, as appears by that examination set down already taken upon oath before Sir <HI>Anthony Weldon, &amp;c.</HI> and subscribed by <HI>Andrew Lydall</HI> Clerk Committee. This untruth may well stand for two, or at least be printed in a Capitall Letter, because he affirms a grosse lye, and a thing quite contrary to truth, to be under the hand of the Clerk of the Committee.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Cretensis</HI> proceeds upon this examination, that he saw it, <HI>which I saw</HI>; I might here say, <HI>Tally on,</HI> this is a fifth phib in this relation; for how could <HI>Cre|tensis</HI> see that which never was; but if he saw any such thing that <HI>Francis Tillet</HI> should deny these words, he must needs see something that was forged by some of his Sectaries, to engage him to confute Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> Book.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Cretensis</HI> further asserts, that he read this under the hand of the Clerk of the Committee: I might here say <HI>Cretensis</HI> still advances in his <HI>Cretian</HI> way, and this is the sixth flaw; for how could he read that which never was? and I conceive <HI>Cretensis</HI> will upon a review of what he hath written, cry <HI>peccavi,</HI> and say, I was deluded and quite mistaken.</P>
<P N="7">7. And lastly, the said Independent confutation and assertion, for uniformi|ty sake, that it may end as it began, or rather end worse, by rising and ascend|ing in untruths, affirms in the close of it, that this examination is forth-coming for any man to peruse for his satisfaction. Now Reader remember the account, for this is the seventh and eighth time at least, yea the ninth and tenth that this confutation prevaricateth with the truth; for in these words, this examination is forth-coming, there are many lyes. First, there is no such examination. Se|conly, then it cannot be forth-coming. Thirdly, not for any one man to per|use, much lesse for any man. And fourthly, it can be much lesse for satisfaction. And I much wonder <HI>Cretensis,</HI> if you had seen and read an examination under

the hand of the Clerk of the Committee, proving what you here say, and con|futing this part of the story related by me of <HI>Cosens,</HI> and that tending so much to the satisfaction of any man, why did you not cause it to be forth-coming, printing it here together with your Confutation? Certainly <HI>Cretensis,</HI> had you seen and read such an examination under the hand of the Clerk of the said Committee, there can be no reason given why you should not have printed that, as well as an Anabaptists Letter written to an Anabaptist, and a writing given you from Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI>; surely an examination under the Clerks hand of a Committee, would have been more authenticall with rationall men to have convicted my Book of untruths, then a Letter of an Anabaptisticall boy, &amp;c. and therefore for my part, I am confident, <HI>Cretensis</HI> saw that in the exami|nation brought him by <HI>Cosens,</HI> which being printed, would have disadvan|taged his foul-mouth'd Confutation of this story, either contradicting, or rendring the whole suspected; and therefore he suppressed it, being wil|ling to blast my Book for the present, while it was new come forth, and much sought after; making account, if after I should be able to disprove him, yet he could not play his after game, either by pleading mistakes, and that he was so informed, or else by his Rhetorick and words at will, wrusting either the examination brought him to these word in <HI>Cretensis,</HI> or else these words and phrases of his to the examination; however one way or other to shift for his credit, and to wrangle it out, in which <HI>Cretensis</HI> hath a wonderfull Art and faculty by his wit and largenesse of conscience, to call black white, and to make <HI>quidlibet ex quolibet</HI>; and however <HI>Cretensis,</HI> to work the Reader to a belief of him in the confutation of this part of the sto|ry of <HI>Cosens,</HI> speaks of an examination under the hand of the Clerk of the said Committee, which he saw and read; yet I am confident he knew it would not prove what he here saith, and my confidence is upon this ground, because from his own words I gather he had this counter-information from the mouth of the said <HI>Cosens,</HI> and the examination under the hand of the Clerk of the Committee (what ever it was) was brought him by <HI>Cosens</HI>:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Oretens. pag.</HI> 40.

will be ready to witnesse also the truth of what then passed; so that by all this the Reader may see more untruth in one peece of <HI>Cretensis</HI> confutati|on of the story of <HI>Cosens,</HI> then there are pretended untruths, made by all the art and malice of <HI>Cretensis</HI> against the whole story of <HI>Cosens</HI>; so that to con|clude this I aske of <HI>Cretensis</HI> who is the lyar now? and I suppose I may more truly apply <HI>Cretensis</HI> own words a little changed, spoken against me to him|self: doubtlesse the man hath sold himself to write all, and all manner of un|truths, that hee can but scrapple together from what mouths, or tongues, or pens, he cares not so they be but Independent in their constitution, and car|ry any antipathy in them to the honour and good of Presbytery; and in case they be but such, 'tis no matter if they be Anabaptists, Seekers, yea loose drunken persons and Blasphemers. <HI>Cretensis</HI> by this Answer hath proved many things I spake of in <HI>Gangraena,</HI> all the Sectaries and Blasphemers closing with Independents, and the Independents with them to make one common party against the godly Orthodox Ministers and people of these Kingdomes who are for truth and peace.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Cretensis</HI> proceeds to infringe the truth of my Relation of the story of <HI>Cosens</HI> in five other particulars; but by this part of the story which I have made good, and the many particulars wherein I have disproved <HI>Cretensis,</HI> especially considering 'tis all of the same complexion, <HI>Cosens</HI> information being the sole ground whereupon <HI>Cretensis</HI> goes, (as he confesses <HI>pag.</HI> 40.) the Reader may easily guesse at the rest, and my Authors <HI>I</HI> with the Records produced, are more authentick then <HI>Cosens</HI> bare <HI>no</HI>; therefore for present I shall not enlarge further upon the third, fourth, fifth heads of <HI>Cretensis,</HI> but reserve to my full Reply the whole Relation of <HI>Cosens</HI> being bound over by the Justices upon these blasphe|mies attested against him to the Sessions, and of his being imprisoned for speak|ing words against a Member of the House of Commons, dwelling in that coun|ty, and of the complaint for his blasphemies against Christ exhibited to the Re|corder of Rochester, and of the Recorders binding him to his good behaviour out of the pious sense he had of the wrong done to Christ, and the words he spake to him, and of his addresse to the Committee of Kent for a review of these Depositions, &amp;c. only there seems to be some interfering between the third and fourth branch of <HI>Cretensis</HI> confutation; <HI>Cretensis</HI> denying <HI>Cosens</HI> to be ever under any restraint, or needing any order from any in place, or to any in place to release <HI>Cosens,</HI> in reference to his blasphemies; and yet he saith presently after, upon the fight of the fore-mentioned examination taken upon oath before the Committee, by the Justices the man was discharged: Now I demand, What was he discharged from? and whether was not this discharging of the man a releasing of the man? <HI>Oportet</HI> Cretensem <HI>esse memorem.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="103" REF="100">4. As to <HI>Cretensis</HI> sixt branch, calling that part of the relation of <HI>Cosens</HI> a loud lying Information: I reply,
'Tis a mainifest truth, and will be witnessed by many, that <HI>Den, Lamm,</HI> and <HI>Woodman,</HI> all three of them have preached in <HI>Cosens</HI> house, which is so evident in Rochester, that as the dayes of the moneth when they preached are known, so are the names of many of the Auditours that were present: and for proof of it, 'tis given me under hand from Roche|ster, <Q>that <HI>Woodman</HI> himself confest it the very same day he preached before a Justice of peace and other witnesses, being apprehended by the Officers, and brought before him, who being thus convented gave it under his hand, that he would never again preach within five miles of Rochester: and though <HI>Cosens</HI> saith he knowes no such man (which we think, upon good ground, is a lie,) yet can he deny that <HI>Woodman</HI> hath preached in his house? which is the thing asserted.</Q></P>
<P N="5">5. For that last part of the relation of <HI>Cosens</HI> going to Master <HI>Clares, &amp;c.</HI> for uniformity sake, made a lie by <HI>Cretensis,</HI> because he was set upon it to blast all for lies;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cosens</HI> going to heare Mr <HI>Clare</HI> preach.</NOTE> I reply, that as the first part is confessed to be true, so is the last as true, though denyed; for Master <HI>Clare</HI> affirmes, he said he would complain of him; and let <HI>Cosens</HI> be think himself what he said of Master <HI>Clare,</HI> and he must confesse it. As for that argument <HI>Cretensis</HI> brings why he did not threaten to complain of him, and that the man dares not threa|ten to question any whatsoever, because 'tis his judgment, none ought to be questioned or troubled for their judgements in matters appertaining unto God: I answer, 'Tis a weak one, and it followes not; because the Sectaries prin|ciples and practices do not agree, they practising many things often wherein they professe contrary: How many Sectaries have we in these dayes, who plead for, and professe liberty of conscience, which yet have not only threatned godly Ministers and Christians for their consciences, but actually have brought them into trouble, and punished them severall waies? Surely <HI>Cretensis,</HI> if you had read Histories of the Church, both ancient and modern, you would have sound Hereticks and Sectaries, as Arians, Donatists, Anabaptists, Socini|ans, Arminians professing as <HI>Cosens</HI> here does, who yet when they have had opportunities, proved great persecuters of the Orthodox godly Ministers; and wee well know by many shrewd signes and instances, that if <HI>Cretensis</HI> and his abettors, who have so much pleaded for a Toleration, shall come once to get power in their hands, they will as much tolerate Presbyterians, as now they will to come into any place, office, employment Ecclesiasticall, Civill, or Military, where 'tis in their power to hinder them. And there|fore <HI>Cretensis,</HI> you had need bring better Arguments to confute my <HI>Antapolo|gie,</HI> (which your Sectaries give out you are upon); or else you will doe the

<P N="6">6. <HI>Cretensis</HI> in his animadversions and inferences made upon my relation of the story of <HI>Cosens,</HI> not knowing who related it to me, nor the occasion of the relation, &amp;c. yet in the close of his confutation of the story of <HI>Co|sens,</HI> most falsly and wickedly, without fear or wit, brands him who related it to mee with such words as these, <HI>But who is Master</HI> Edwards <HI>godly ortho|dox Presbyterian Minister<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">? Is hee not such a one who works stoutly at the forge, and feeds both himselfe and the world with all manner of scandals and falshoods against the Independents without fear?</HI> Certainly, <HI>Cretensis throat is an open sepulchre, and the poyson of asps is under his lips. What shall be gi|ven unto thee,</HI> or <HI>What shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue?</HI> This passage against the godly Minister who told mee this story, fils up the measure of <HI>Cretensis</HI> rage, lying, and evill speaking; and hee could hardly have spoken more untrue words then these, whether hee consider the man himselfe, or the manner of his relating it. In one word, the Minister who related this story to me, is a reverend, learned, godly, humble, retired man, a man who hath been many yeers of good account in the Church of God, a Member al|so of the Assembly, and a man far from forging, or feeding himselfe and the world with all manner of scandals against the Independents, &amp;c. and this Minister did not make it his businesse or work to tell mee this story, coming to mee, or ever intending to come: but I, going in London upon my occasions, this Minister accidentally being in a shop with a friend of his, a Citizen whom I knew also, I spake to them as I was going by, and they to mee; and so in the shop exchanging a few words, the Citizen asked me if my Book were come forth, or when it would: whereupon this Minister and I had some words about the subject of it, and falling into discourse, hee related this story to mee and the Citizen; which when I had it from him, the last sheet of my Book being either printing off, or quite printed off, I put it in a Postscript, as the Reader sees: and therefore let all the world judg what untruths <HI>Cretensis</HI> hath belched out against this reverend and worthy Minister. But <HI>Cretensis</HI> is a man that in all his Writings and Sermons falls upon all that come in his way, having no respect of age, place, gifts, sufferings, &amp;c. if they be against his fond conceits and Sectaries.</P>
<P>And thus, good Reader, I have gone over all the particular materiall ex|ceptions made against my Book entituled <HI>Gangraena,</HI> by Master <HI>Saltmarsh,</HI> Master <HI>Walwyn,</HI> and <HI>Cretensis</HI>; and I doubt not, but by this time, even by this briefer Reply, every indifferent Reader is satisfied, how unjust and false those outcries and clamours of lyes lyes, are, and how in them that Pro|verb
<PB N="105" REF="101">
is verified, <HI>A great cry, but a little wooll:</HI> little cause, but onely the rage and madnesse of the Sectaries to see themselves and their wayes so laid open in the sight of the Sun. And yet I have not done with my Antagonists, but shall more fully anatomize and rip them up, and further justifie and cleer all things excepted against in <HI>Gangraena,</HI> which being lighter, are now passed over, or though spoken unto, need further amplification and illustra|tion. In a word, there is nothing behinde untoucht, that either glances upon mee, or speaks for themselves and their partie; but I intend to speak to it fully, and am resolved (God sparing me life and opportunity) not to die in their debt. And I could now play the Rhetorician, and spend some leaves in running over all the Errours, Heresies, Blasphemies, Practices, Sto|ries, &amp;c. laid down in <HI>Gangraena,</HI> not so much as once offered to be dispro|ved, though they be of persons and things here living, and acted in London, and neer at hand, and which <HI>Cretensis,</HI> with all his gatherings, intelligences, ob|servations and presentations from Sectaries of severall sorts, Anabaptists, Inde|pendents, Seekers, &amp;c. and of severall parts in the Kingdome, Kent, Essex, London, &amp;c. hath been able to say nothing against; and might, going from one particular to another, triumph over <HI>Cretensis,</HI> stamping the superscription of <HI>Truth</HI> upon them, and ask him, What say you to the 84. and 85. Errours laid down in the Catalogue? Is it not true that such things were preached in London? Whether is not that which I have related of <HI>Paul Best</HI> true? Whe|ther did not Master <HI>Burroughs</HI> and Master <HI>Greenhill</HI> preach bitterly against the Petition of many well affected Citizens for the setling of Government? And so I might goe through hundreds; and of all those facts, opinions, practi|ces that these three men have not been able (though so willing) to except a|gainst, inferre, conclude, and flourish over <HI>Cretensis</HI> with his owne sword. There is no reasonable man, that considers the malignitie, wrath, &amp;c. of Ma|ster <HI>Saltmarsh,</HI> Master <HI>Walwyn,</HI> but especially of <HI>Cretensis,</HI> against me and my late Book, and the opportunities they have had through their acquaintance with Sectaries of all sorts; besides the publick notice given of answering me, as appears by the intelligence and particulars brought in to <HI>Cretensis</HI> from severall places, to furnish him their Champion; together with the extreme eager desire of <HI>Cretensis</HI> taking all advantages against mee, making matter of confutation and lies of that which I am confident was never made by any Scholar in an Answer before, (as, <HI>the house a meeting for Sectaries</HI>; as, the not be|ing able to put <HI>the Nominative case and Verb together,</HI> and such like) but wil think they have spoke the utmost they possibly could against my Book, and that of course some of the things drawn up and represented by the hand of Envie must needs be false: so that whereas <HI>Cretensis</HI> conceives, that now in his
<PB N="106" REF="102">
Answer hee hath informed the world how many lyes and untruths there are in <HI>Gangraena</HI>; the truth is, that hee and his fellow-sectaries have done it but faintly, and with the extreme dammage of their own cause: for all wise and unprejudiced men will acquit all the other particulars from the crimes and im|putations of lies and falshood, and conclude them all true and certain; for surely, if there had been any hole to have been picked in them, either the malice, or the wit, or the industry, or one thing or other of <HI>Cretensis</HI> and his associates, would have found it out, and not have spared me: so that the ve|ry enemies bear winesse to the truth of the body of my Book, the things that are found fault with by them being but a spot here and there, a few in com|parison, (if spots) and I may say of all the exceptions taken by my three An|tagonists, supposing them to be mistakes, (though I have shewed the contrary) What are these among so many not excepted against, being but as gleanings to the vintage?</P>
<P><HI>Cretensis, pag.</HI> 50. and in his last Section, winds up his Answer in speak|ing to the Reader, that <HI>though for the present hee hath given</HI> him <HI>onely a taste of Master</HI> Edwards <HI>grapes, yet sufficient,</HI> hee <HI>presumes, to convince the Reader, that his vine is the vine of Sodom,</HI> &amp;c. and <HI>professes that he hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> read one quar|ter of the Book as yet, nor knowes nor whether ever hee shall care to read it thorow or no:</HI> and then labours to possesse the Reader, that <HI>what hee hath not answer|ed, others will very shortly: a few dayes</HI> (hee <HI>makes no question</HI>) <HI>will give the Reader more light to comprehend the darknesse of</HI> Gangraena; and prophesies, <HI>The day will come, and is even at the door, when there will be scarce one stone left upon another of all this false building, which will not be pull'd down by the hand of Truth: And when the servants of God shall have had the opportunity to wash off that durt and filth which Mr.</HI> Edwards <HI>hath cast upon them,</HI> Gangraena <HI>will be found a strumpet, yea, and of the race and linage of that great scarlet Whore, which corrupteth the earth with her fornication.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> As for <HI>Cretensis</HI> saying, hee hath <HI>onely for present given a taste of Master</HI> Edwards <HI>grapes,</HI> implying, hee could feed the Reader with whole clusters, and intimating hee hath a great deal more to say to my Book, as other passages expresse besides this, <HI>viz. pag.</HI> 38. <HI>I presume that Mistris</HI> Gan|graena <HI>hath not as yet paid mee the tythe or tenth part of her forgeries,</HI> &amp;c. I answer, I beleeve <HI>Cretensis</HI> hath said all hee possibly could against <HI>Gan|graena</HI>; I doe not think hee left out any thing hee could object against it: Whosoever reads but his Answer, and observes his rage and heat, his playing at the smallest games, and picking of straws to finde matter against my Book to fill up six sheets with, railing and declaiming against it, will not think hee gave but a taste, or a tenth. But how could <HI>Cretensis</HI> say
<PB N="107" REF="102">
hee had given onely a taste for the present, and not the tenth part, when as hee professes truely hee <HI>had not read one quarter of the Book then, neither knew whether hee should ever care to read it thorow or no?</HI> Could hee divine of what hee had not read, nor knew not whether ever hee should reade, that there was ten times more behinde? And besides, How could <HI>Cre|tensis,</HI> out of what hee knew not whether hee should ever read, promise the Reader to give him not onely a taste, but abundance? Certainly <HI>Cretensis</HI> meant the far greatest part of his grapes promised the Reader, should be gathered by other hands, and be (as hee saith of the particulars detected already) observed by others, and presented to him: and after this rate of the farre greatest part of particulars observed by others, and presented to him, 'tis easie for <HI>Cretensis</HI> to give Answers; and I much wonder we have no more of them, but that he takes almost two yeers to give an Answer to the <HI>Antapologie.</HI> And no wonder, <HI>Cretensis</HI> going upon an implicite faith, making an Answer out of particulars observed by others, without reading one quarter of my Book, not seeing with his own eyes, but making use of a pair of Independent, Antinomian, Anabaptisticall, &amp;c. spectacles to write with, the man is so much mistaken, and sometimes takes that to be great which is little, and that which is great hee cannot see at all. As for that <HI>Cretensis</HI> saith, that hee presumes by the taste hee hath given, hee hath convinced the Reader that my vine is the vine of <HI>Sodom,</HI> my grapes grapes of gall, my clusters bitter, &amp;c. I beleeve every Reader who is not bewitch|ed with the Independent Schismaticall way, is convinced, that <HI>Cretensis</HI> hath said enough to satisfie all men, that his vine is the vine of Sodom, that his grapes are grapes of gall, his wine the poyson of dragons, and the cruell venome of asps, and that generally all men say of his Answer, yea, some of his owne party cry out of it, that it is too bitter: But as for my <HI>Gangraena,</HI> though <HI>objectiv&egrave;,</HI> the object about which the Book is exercised be the vine of Sodom, grapes of gall, poyson of Dragons, and the cru|ell venome of Asps, treating of and laying open the Heresies, Blasphemies and Practices of the Sectaries, which indeed are poysonous and venemous; yet <HI>subjectiv&egrave;,</HI> the Discourse it selfe, and the way of handling those things, is healing and medicinall to cure the Reader of those stings and poysons, which by eating of those sowr grapes of the Sectaries they have contracted; and my Book is farre from being like the vine of Sodom, the poyson of dragons, that in writing of it I have plaid the part of a Physician, made a precious treacle and soveraigne antidote to cure and expell poysons, by cor|recting, qualifying, binding them, &amp;c. laying open the Errours, Heresies, &amp;c. their evill, danger, and discovering remedies and cures proper for them,
<PB N="108" REF="103">
which, were they taken, and the prescriptions followed, I am confident would prove the healing of these Nations.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Cretensis</HI> profession <HI>that he hath not read one quarter of the Book as yet; nor knowes whether he shall ever care to read it through or no:</HI> I re|ply, that <HI>Cretensis</HI> at once, and in one breath discovers himself to be both weak and proud, he shows his folly and horrible pride. First, his folly; for what wise man that had reason and common sense, though he could not <HI>Cretensis pag.</HI> 10.24. have * <HI>construed a peece of Latin, write true English, nor framed the structure of a period according to the common rules of Grammar,</HI> would have writ so? and truly this and other passages in this Answer, confirms me much in that opinion which many understanding learned Di|vines have had of <HI>Cretensis</HI> a great while, that he is no judicious rationall man (as his followers cry him up) but only a wordy Divine, a multitude of words, that's all; that being true of him which was said of <HI>Erasmus,</HI> that his writings were <HI>verba, non res</HI>; but of this folly of <HI>Cretensis,</HI> the Reader may remember what I have written <HI>page</HI> 39. of this Book; and let <HI>Cretensis</HI> ever take me so writing, and I will confesse my folly. Seconly, 'Tis horrible pride and arrogancie; what a proud passage is this, <HI>Cretensis</HI> thinks himself so great, and looks down with such disdain upon me, as that he knowes not whether ever he shall care to read my Book thorough or no, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lighting it as not being worth his reading, nor I worthy to carry his Books after him; this speech indeed is neer akin to that in <HI>page</HI> 15. <HI>In|deed if Independent Ministers had either the priviledge of ease to preach to the bare walls and pewes in their meeting places:</HI> The Independent Ministers are so taken up with preaching to great Congregations, and with the re|sort of great persons to their houses, and with the consultations they are ad|mitted untill mid-night about great affairs; and particularly <HI>Cretensis</HI> of late, as 'tis talked every where in <HI>London, that he knowes not whether he shall ever care to read my Book thorough or no, or shall ever have leasure to do it</HI>; but <HI>Cretensis,</HI> let me tell you how much soever you slight my Books, and care not to read them thorough, as too much below you, yet there are your betters for all kind of learning, yeers, piety, that care to read tho|rough my Books, and blesse God for them; and though they be of as pier|cing deep judgements as <HI>Cretensis,</HI> yet could never find that <HI>non-sense, weak|nesse of judgement, &amp;c.</HI> which <HI>Cretensis</HI>&punc; speaks of so often. As for that <HI>Cretensis</HI> promises the Reader, <HI>that a few dayes (he makes no question) will give the Reader more light wherewith to comprehend my darknesse,</HI> imply|ing as if more Answers were suddenly to come forth, to discover the falshood of matters contained in <HI>Gangraena.</HI> I reply, a few dayes are past,
<PB N="109" REF="103">
yea some weeks, between seven and eight, and yet there is none of <HI>Creten|sis</HI> new-light come forth, no Answers disproving any one particular in my Book; there is a Book indeed of one <HI>Bacons</HI> come forth, who both in the Title page and Book speaks of my <HI>Gangraena,</HI> but he confesses the truth of what I speak of him, <HI>viz.</HI> his being put out of <HI>Gloster,</HI> his be|ing received in a great mans house, and his going to <HI>Bristoll</HI> since the Parliaments taking of it; so that it seems by the confession of one of <HI>Cretensis</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nts, all matters are not lyes which are mentioned in <HI>Gan|graena</HI>; and yet before Master <HI>Bacons</HI> Book came forth, I was told con|fidently severall times (as the report of the Sectaries) that was one of my lyes, speaking of Master <HI>Bacons</HI> going to <HI>Bristoll,</HI> whereas he had never been out of <HI>London</HI> since the taking of <HI>Bristoll:</HI> But I suppose how|ever <HI>Cretensis</HI> dayes are past, and nothing is come forth to comprehend my darknesse, yet I make no question but this Reply with the further Reply coming after will give light to the Reader to comprehend <HI>Creten|sis</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">his darknesse.

For that expression of <HI>Cretensis</HI> by that time the boughs of the trees are a little more withered, they will be broken off, the women will come and set them on fire.

As to those words of <HI>Cretensis, The day will come, and is even at the doore, when there will be a scarce one stone left upon another of all this false building, which will not be puld down by the hand of truth.</HI> I reply, for all <HI>Cretensis</HI> pro|phesying of such a day, and that even at the doore; there is no such day yet come, not any hand since <HI>Cretensis,</HI> having pull'd down one stone from this building, though it be now about two months ago since <HI>Cre|tensis</HI> threatned this; but the Reader may see the contrary is fulfilled this day, and that instead of pulling down this building of <HI>Gangraena,</HI> the building is enlarged a story higher, and in breadth also, by the addition of this second part of <HI>Gangraena</HI>; and <HI>Cretensis</HI> will finde <HI>Gangraena</HI> will bee so farre from being puld down, that other buildings of the same kinde will bee framed by it; and this first stone laid by mee, or first building will prosper into a rowe, a whole street before I and others have done with the Sectaries, whereas <HI>Cretensis</HI> Babels, built without any founda|tion, and daubed with untempered mortar, will fall down to the ground, and be as a refuge for lies, that fails, and is swept away as the Spiders Cobweb.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="104">And lastly, to those words of <HI>Cretensis, When the servants of God shall have had the opportunity to wash off that dirt and filth which Master</HI> Ed|wards <HI>hath now cast upon them,</HI> Gangraena <HI>will be found a strumpet; &amp;c.</HI> I reply, The most of those persons whom I have named in <HI>Gangraena,</HI> I durst not for all the world call them the servants of God thus publike|ly as <HI>Cretensis</HI> doth, lest I should be found guilty of strengthening them in their wicked errours and practices (but of my grounds in this, the Reader shall have a more full account in my second Reply): and there|fore (meaning it of such) the servants of God shall have no opportunity to wash off that dirt and filth which I have cast upon them; for they that are such, as <HI>Clarkson, Webb, Wright, Hich, Denne, Nichols, L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m, Oats, Kiffin, Walwyn, Marshall, Ienney,</HI> Mistris <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eway, cum multis aliis,</HI> (I may say with the Apostle) <HI>serve not our Lord Iesus Christ but their own bellies,</HI> and their own lusts; <HI>and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.</HI> But as for some few, among many whom I have named in <HI>Gangraena,</HI> as Master <HI>Burroughs,</HI> Master <HI>Greenhill,</HI> and some such, it may be they are the servants of God, and Saints, though wherein I have blamed them, they walk as men, and as carnall, and not as Saints; and can never wash off that dirt I have cast upon them (so is <HI>Cretensis</HI> phrase) without repentance, and that they will finde one day, when they shall come to be awakened from their wine. And therefore in|stead of <HI>Gangraena</HI> being found a strumpet, <HI>Cretensis</HI> will be found a lyar, and <HI>Gangraena</HI> a chaste Lady, and true Virgin; and it will appear (I doubt not, before it be long) when the time of the reigne of the Sectaries shall be over, and they no more heard of, unlesse it bee by way of a proverb and reproach, that then Master <HI>Edwards Gangraena</HI> shall be looked upon by all as a witnesse of the truth, even against Se|ctaries in the ages to come, and as a discovery of the wickednesse and vilenesse of the Sectaries of this time. And whereas <HI>Cretensis</HI> would make my Book <HI>of the linage and race of the great Woore corrupting the earth, &amp;c. Gangraena</HI> is of a quite different nature, and contrary li|nage, being a great means (through the blessing of God) of preser|ving the earth from being corrupted and tainted by the fornications and poysonous principles of the Sectaries; the Book doing much good; as I could prove by plen|tifull testimonies of Letters written from many parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>I received a Letter last week out of the Country subscribed with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o hands of Godly Ministers testifying to my work&punc; and earnestly intreating my constant persuance, with a promise that I shall not want what their prayers and endeavours can contri|b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e to that work.

Master <HI>Goodwin,</HI> Con|sider sadly of what you have done in your Book <HI>Cretensis,</HI> how you are become guilty, and have made your selfe partaker of all the He|resies, B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">asphemies, wicked practices I have spoken against, in plead|ing for all (without any distinction) as Saints, servants of God, and such like, and speaking against with envenomed malignity that ne|cessary usefull Book as a very pest and plague, which I writ for dis|covery of Errours and erroneous persons, that so the Saints might take heed, and beware of them; and in which all godly orthodox, faithfull Ministers doe rejoyce, and blesse God for it.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>I have received severall Letters from particular Ministers in Essex bearing witnesse; and so Letters out of Kent to the same purpose, and from other places.</HI></NOTE> O wretched man, to carry things so, as if Errours would doe no harme to mens soules, but a Book written against them, that will hurt and hazzard mens soules; which is all one, as if a man should say Strong poyson would doe no hurt, nor kill, but a precious An|tidote will destroy and ruine mens bodies. And now, good Reader, I desire thee impartially and without prejudice to weigh <HI>Cretensis</HI> objections and exceptions against my Book, and my Answers, and then judge whe|ther I have not wounded, and laid this great <HI>Goliah</HI> of the Sectaries (com|ing out in defiance against the Reformed Churches) upon his back; and whether God, who chuseth the weak things of the world to confound the things that are mighty; and things which are despised, to bring to nought things that are of esteeme, hath not made use of me, a man so vilified by the Sectaries, <HI>a poor weak thimble full of dust,</HI> by the wind strongly blowing this thimble full of dust into <HI>Cretensis</HI> eyes, to blinde him, and befool him. And yet I have not done with <HI>Cretensis,</HI> but let the Reader look for what's behind, <HI>viz.</HI> my fuller Reply; and what ever in this first is either omitted, or not so fully spoken unto, in that he may look to receive more satisfaction. And I no whit doubt, but that, as I have now (by Gods assistance) made a good beginning both defensive and offensive; so by the same good hand up|on me, I shall in the next give so good an account, that I shal deal with this daring enemy, as little <HI>David</HI> with <HI>Goliah,</HI> stand upon him, and triumph o|ver

him, and give you his head upon the top of my sword: And in my next I intend to dresse him up, and set him out in all his ornaments and flowers, in his practices, opinions, and wayes of promoting them; in all which I shall render him and his name an abhorring to this and the following gene|rations.</P>
<P>Since <HI>Cretensis</HI> answer, there is a Book come forth, written by one Mr. <HI>Bacon,</HI> which Book is answered by one Mr. <HI>Corbet,</HI> (the man whom in that Book hee so often speaks of) and it is abroad in print already: What I spake of him in <HI>Gangraena,</HI> hee in that Book confesses, as his being cast out of Glocester, and his coming to London, &amp;c. speaking particularly of that which I touched only, and but in generall (as the Lords house in which hee lives.) And besides that, I heare one <HI>Web</HI> hath an Answer in the Presse to what I relate of him <HI>pag.</HI> 106, 107. which Answer, before it went to the Presse, by a providence came to my hand without ever seeking it, or indeed imagining that ever <HI>Web</HI> (such an Heretike and Blasphemer) durst have ap|peared in print, or been taken notice of to be in London, for feare of be|ing questioned for those things I have written of him: But wee may see what sad times wee are fallen into, and that the Sectaries are grown fear|lesse, that they dare come abroad and plead their desperate cause, as Master <HI>Saltmarsh, Walwyn</HI>; so now Master <HI>Bacon,</HI> and <HI>Web</HI>; which symptome, among many others, makes mee feare the night and darknesse is at hand, when as the wolves and the wild beasts dare come thus out of their dens; whereas when the Sun arises they go to their dens. The Psalmist tels us, <HI>Psal.</HI> 104.20, 22. <HI>Thou makest darknesse, and it is night, when all the beasts of the forrest do creep forth. The Sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them downe in their dens.</HI> Hence the Scripture cals wolves <HI>the wolves of the evening, Zeph.</HI> 3.3. and look as the Frogs croaking and making a noyse use to be in the evening, so the croaking of false Teachers resembled to wolves, the beasts of the forrest, and Frogs, presages the going downe of the Sun, and night coming. But because I purpose not to trouble my selfe with giving any formall answer to it by it selfe, I shall now give these Ani|madversions upon it: First, That <HI>Web</HI> confesses most of the things I relate of him; only hee saith of some of them, hee had recanted and disclaimed them; and I should not have upbraided him, but rejoyced in his conversion. But unto that I reply; Had not this <HI>Web,</HI> since his Recantation and Release, both in Citie and Countrey, vented many desperate things, and gone on in his hereticall wayes, I should never have mentioned them. Secondly, That this <HI>Web</HI> rancks himselfe in his Answer among the Independents, speaking of mee as being so against him out of my ill will to Independents; and I
<PB N="114" REF="106">
finde <HI>Iohn Bachiler,</HI> an Independent, not onely (April 1. 1646.) setting his <HI>Imorimatur,</HI> but helping him in his Answer, mending severall things in the Answer: as for example, For those words I charge him with, that he should say, <HI>For him to say he was equal with Christ, was no robberie</HI>; in his Answer to that, <HI>Bachiler</HI> helps this Blasphemer, and takes part with him: as for instance, whereas <HI>Web</HI> justifies it, that
<Q>Gods love is the same in every re|spect unto the Saints as unto Christ, and therefore a Saint may say he is e|quall with Christ, and count it no robbery; [<HI>in every respect</HI>] is blotted out by <HI>Bachiler.</HI></Q>
And <HI>VVeb</HI> further pleading he might say, The Saints were e|quall to Christ; next following these words of <HI>Webs,</HI> [<HI>As I conceive, the word of God to be my rule,</HI>] there is interlined under <HI>Bachilers</HI> hand these words, [<HI>Provided I meet with a faire and candid interpretation of my Words.</HI>] And so I could instance in divers other alterations: so that we may see the Indepen|dents will not lose any the most blasphemous, Atheisticall hereticall men, but further them, and joyne with them against the Presbyterians, licensing their Writings, helping them to conceale, and deliver more cautelously their dan|gerous opinions. Thirdly, for that which is related by me in <HI>Gangraena</HI> of <HI>Webs</HI> speaking so wickedly of the Scriptures, he denyes it not, but saith to this purpose, How could hee say so? for he should contradict himselfe in other things which he hath said and holds: But to that I answer, 'Tis no new thing for such men as he to say, and unsay, affirme and deny according to the companies they come in, and advantages they think they have. Fourthly, To that which I relate of him concerning those expressions of his, <HI>We might not say, God the Father, God the Sonne, God the holy Ghost,</HI> he makes some shuf|fling Answer; but I reply, he spake so, and I can produce good proof of that and all the rest. If a Committee of Parliament shall be pleased to take notice of it, and send for this <HI>Web,</HI> and proceed against him upon proof, I am ready to produce witnesses, and upon his owne confession and those witnesses to make proofe. Onely I desire the Reader to take good notice of one expres|sion in his Answer to this head, which shewes the ignorance both of him and <HI>Bachiler</HI> in the very principles of Religion; and is not <HI>Ba|chiler</HI> a fit man in such a Kingdome as this, to bee a Licenser of Di|vinitie Bookes and Controversies, who besides that hee is no Minister, nor well studied man, is such an <HI>Ignoramus</HI> as this clearely dis|covers him to bee? <HI>Web</HI> saying hee acknowledges the Trinitie, the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost, hath these words, <HI>That hee ac|knowledges the Father is the Sonne, and the Holy Ghost,</HI> and to that purpose; whereas wee are taught from the Scriptures by all Orthodox Di|vines, that though everie Person be God, as the Father is God, the Son is God,
<PB N="115" REF="106">
and the Holy Ghost is God; yet the Father is not the Son, nor the Father is not the Holy Ghost; nor the Son the Father, nor the Holy Ghost. Now <HI>Bachiler</HI> passes this, and though he mended many other passages in <HI>Webs</HI> An|swer putting in words in some places, blotting out words, and changing some expressions for others, yet hee let this passe without any correction or note upon it; which no man can conceive to proceed from any thing else but pro|found ignorance. And that the Reader may know I speak these things upon good ground, I perused this Answer after it was licensed with Master <HI>Ba|chilers</HI> hand, and compared the hand of <HI>Imprimatur, Iohn Bachiler,</HI> with the hand where other words were put in, and found it the same hand, and writ out with my hand, severall amendments made by <HI>Iohn Bachiler,</HI> which I have by mee in writing, and then subscribed my hand under them, with the day of the month when I extracted them out of the Originall Copie; and one being with mee, who was a witnesse of all this, I also intreated his hand to attest it, which hee willingly did: all which I can produce to satisfie a|ny man who desires it.</P>
<P>And for the winding up of all I have to say by way of Reply to Mr. <HI>Salt|marsh,</HI> Mr. <HI>Goodwine,</HI> &amp;c. in vindication of my <HI>Gangraena,</HI> by this time, the Reader may see what to thinke, if among so many hundred particulars which are laid downe by me of Errours, Heresies, Blasphemies, Stories, &amp;c. with so much variety, such a venemous virulent man, picking and chusing, catching and snatching, having Intelligence, and great resort to him from Se|ctaries of all sorts, and out of severall parts, as Essex, Kent, &amp;c. could yet finde so few things to question in <HI>Gangraena,</HI> (which yet also are justified and made good;) what must the whole body of the Booke be, which is not so much as touched, either by <HI>Cretensis,</HI> or any of the rest? And that which a|lone may satisfie any rationall man that there is too much truth in <HI>Gangraena,</HI> is this, that I have never been called in question to make the things good. I have beene informed from good hands, that some of the Sectaries have had meetings, consultations, and severall debates about my Book, what to doe in it, whether to complaine, or what else; and I am confident if they were not afraid that things would bee found too true, and very foule, and upon the through examination might hazzard the danger of bringing an old house upon their heads, and the punishing of many, they would before this time have tried all their friends, and party, to see what they could have done a|gainst mee:</P>
<P>Having finished my Reply to <HI>Cretensis,</HI> Master <HI>Saltmarsh</HI> and Master <HI>Wal|win,</HI> as before it I gave the Reader a fresh, and farther Discoverie of Errours, Heresies, Practices of the Sectaries; So I shall finish this book with matters
<PB N="116" REF="107">
of that kind, laying downe more Errours, Heresies, Blasphemies, Stories, Letters, concerning the Sectaries, concluding all with a few Corollaries drawne from the whole Book.

<P>In my last Book I gave the Reader an account of many of the practices of the Sectaries, both more generally and particularly: and I instanced in twentie eight practices: Now, though there are many more behind, yet be|cause my Book is both expected suddenly to come forth, and is enlarged be|yond my first intention, I will only instance in two.</P>
<P N="1">1. They do deny and professe to many that they are no Independents, no Antinomians, no Anabaptists, but they are thus and thus, and will be so and so; and these are but reproachfull names given out, and cast upon ho|nest, godly, conscientious men by the Ministers and Presbyterians, as Puritan and such like, were in former times by the Bishops; and of this I could give the Reader many proofs in printed Books of the Anabaptists, Independents,
<PB N="118" REF="108">
Antinomians, as such Churches falsly called Anabaptists, &amp;c. And now there is never an Independent in England, if you will but take what themselves say, though they be such who stickle, act, work, vote, and by all wayes, in all places, where they have any thing to do, promote, side with Independents, Anabaptists, &amp;c. yet they will confidently say they are no Independents, they are of no Church way, nor know not what it is; nay, some of them will say they are Presbyterians in their judgement, or at least do wait and stay to see what the Results of the Assembly and Parliament after them will be; and yet there is many of these men, that let any person or thing come in nomination and competitition, that concerns Presbyterie, and they will favour, promote, further Independencie (be it right or wrong) and on the contrarie discountenance, hinder, obstruct the Presbyterians, wherein they just walk in the steps of the Bishops and their creatures, who upon all occa|sions dsclaimed Poperie, Arminianisme, and when Papists and Arminians were spoken of, they would be hot against them, and were against Poperie properly so called (as the expression was) and against <HI>Arminius</HI> (meaning those points <HI>Arminius</HI> held about the government of the Church) not those of Grace and Free-will, &amp;c. and yet these Bishops and their Chaplains pre|ferred Arminians and persons Popishly affected, licensed Books tending that way, brought them oft when in trouble, would remember those who prea|ched against Poperie and Arminianisme; and it was observed, and I have been told it by a man of place in those times, who disliked such wayes, that when the Arch-Bishop blustered and spoke most against any Priest or Papist, and for the Church of England, then the next newes they were sure to hear of, was a Release; and whether there be not too many such in these times, who will not be accounted Independents, Anabaptists, Antinomians, that yet countenance their Books, are familiar with such, being all in all with them, bringing them off when in question, sitting hard on the skirts (when there is any opportunitie) of all those who have complained, or been active against the Sectaries, I leave to all to judge.</P>
<P N="2">2. Some of the Sectaries when they have been questioned, and in trouble, or been by some Ministers convinced, that they had nothing to say for them|selves and their way, have and will do any thing for the present, as recant, confesse their Errours, say they are convinced and satisfied, promise never to go about preaching or dipping any more; and yet afterwards, when free, and come to their companions, go on in their wayes, both against their hands, promises, professions; and of this there are many examples and in|stances among us, as of a Sectarie an Emissarie sent into Northamptonshire, being for his Doctrines, separated meetings, affronting a Minister in the
<PB N="119" REF="108">
Pulpit, complained of by some Ministers, and questioned by the Magistrates, gave it under-his hand to forbeare his course, and return home; yet after|wards goes to other parts of the Countrey, and drawes the people into houses, preaching to them, &amp;c. So some Sectaries of <HI>Lams</HI> Church, or their great Associaces, coming into Essex, to corrupt the people; and some of the Ministers dealing with them upon some of their Tenets, convinced them so, as that they openly blessed God for that dayes work, and the light they had received, even weeping for joy; and yet presently afterwards going on their progresse to seduce at another Town in the same Countie (some hint or notice being given of their late conviction) they said they wept to think how nigh the Ministers were come to them; and so I might give instance in <HI>Clarkson</HI> professing against the dipping to get out of prison, and as soon as he was loose turning Seeker; and so in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> b</HI>; but I must take off my hand; only this fulfils what is spoken in the Scriptures of Heretikes, <HI>That they have their consciences seared with an hot iron, and sin, being condemned of themselves.</HI></P>

against the Scots, and against some of our Ministers, and the books written against the Sectaries; and some men (whom a man could hardly have thought it of) would curse the Scots, saying, A pox upon the Scots, would they were gone, we would give them any thing to be rid of them, and pay them all their money in time: many persons of note of the Independent Faction did often resort to this house, and still they would speak most bit|terly and basely of our Brethren of Scotland: The Master of the Family would be often attempting to kisse this young maid, watching her upon the staires and other places, as going up and down, and hath tempted her to be naught, insomuch that the young maid spake to him, Sir, You have a wife of your owne, why should you speak thus? how dare you offer to do this wickednesse, and sin against God? Vnto whom this Gentleman the In|dependent (and an Antinomian too surely) replied, &rindx; That God saw no sin in his children, that these were but sins in the flesh, which Christ had satisfied for, with other words to that purpose. One time this man tempting her, threw her all along, so that she was forced to cry out, and her Mistresse came in to her rescue, and said, Fie husband, will you never leave these tricks? whereupon the maid would not stay, but came away, and when her father heard it, he would not indure she should stay any longer, but had her away presently; and so this young maid is converted from being an Independent and Sectarie, by beholding their carriage and loosenesse, blessing God she is delivered from that way and those persons: she had thought the Sectaries had been such holy persons, that there had been none like them, till she saw both that family, and many who resorted thither of the same way, so loose. This godly Christian tells me, That his daughter is ready to take her oath of the truth of these things which she hath both seen and heard, and with ma|ny circumstances hath declared to him, as the names of such that resorted thither, that she never knew nor heard of before, with other circumstances; and that he believes them to be so true, as that they are past all question.</P>
<P>There is a Sectary, an Independent Antinomian Taylor, who stealing a whole yard of Plush from a Gentleman, and some yards of Sattin from an|other, and being found out in his sin, and convinced, so that he could not deny it; some speaking to him how sorrie they were that such a man as he should do these things; he replied, (as I had it from two honest men of good account) to this effect, that he was troubled for them to see them sorrie, but as for himselfe, he was not troubled.</P>

<P>There is one <HI>Samuel Oats</HI> a Weaver (a man I have spoken of in my for|mer book, and in this too, <HI>page</HI> 10.) who being of <HI>Lams</HI> Church, was sent out as a Dipper and Emissary into the Countreyes: Last summer I heard he went his progresse into <HI>Surrey</HI> and <HI>Sussex,</HI> but now this yeare he is sent out into <HI>Essex</HI> three or foure months ago, and for many weeks together went up and downe from place to place, and Towne to Towne, about <HI>Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hen, Braintry, Tarling,</HI> and those parts, preaching his erroneous Doctrines, and dipping ma|ny in rivers; this is a young lusty fellow, and hath traded chiefly with young women and young maids, dipping many of them, though all is fish that comes to his net, and this he did with all boldnesse and without all controul for a matter of two moneths: A godly Minister of <HI>Essex</HI> coming out of those parts related, hee hath baptized a great number of women, and that they were call'd out of their beds to go a dipping in rivers, dipping manie of them in the night, so that their Husbands and Masters could not keep them in their houses, and 'tis commonly reported that this <HI>Oats</HI> had for his pains ten shil|lings apeece for dipping the richer, and two shillings six pence for the poorer; he came veriebare and meane into <HI>Essex,</HI> but before hee had done his work, was well lined, and growne pursie. In the cold weather in <HI>March,</HI> hee dipped a young woman, one <HI>Ann Martin</HI> (as her name is given in to me) whom he held so long in the water, that she fell presently sicke, and her belly sweld with the abundance of water she took in, and within a fortnight or three weeks died, and upon her death-bed expressed her dipping to be the cause of her death. There was another woman also whom he baptized, as a godly Minister that came out of those parts, and had beene at <HI>Braintry</HI> related to me from a good hand, whom after he had baptized, he bid her gape, and she gaped, and he did blow three times into her mouth, saying words to this purpose, either <HI>receive the holy Ghost,</HI> or now <HI>thou hast received the holy Ghost.</HI> At last for his dipping one who died so presently after it, and other misdemeanors the man was questioned in the Countrey, and bound over to the Sessions at <HI>Chen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ford,</HI> where <HI>Aprill</HI> the seventh, 1646. this <HI>Oats</HI> appeared, and I had the relation I now speak of, from three persons that were

Some passages also in his prayer were repeated, as that hee prayed the Parliament might not cart the Ark, nor meddle with making Lawes for the Saints, which Jesus Christ was to do alone. Since <HI>Oats</HI> commitment to Colchester Jaile, there hath been great and mightie re|sort to him in the prison, many have come downe from London in Coaches to visit him, as a godly Minister who came out of Essex told me: And I have a Letter by me from a Minister in Colchester, sent last week to a friend of his in London, wherein he writes thus; Oats <HI>the Anabaptist hath had great re|sort to him in the Castle, both of Town and Countrey; but the Committee or|dered the contrarie last Saturday.</HI></P>

Vnto whom this Sectarie replied, <HI>How will you prove the Scriptures to be the word of God?</HI> and this Sectarie reasoned against them, saying, there were twentie severall Scrip|tures, as many as Translations, and Translations are not true; for so the Priests will tell us, that this is not rightly translated: and for the Originals there are divers Copies; besides, I cannot understand them, neither is it my fault that I do not: In sum, the man reasoned there was no Religion at all in the Kingdome, but all Religion he knew of was, <HI>To do justly, and be mer|cifull.</HI> Vnto which the Gentleman replyed, The Heathen they were just and merciful, and therein did as much as you.

to London, and meeting with M. <HI>Sympson,</HI> among other discourse, asked him if hee might come to his Church, and whether the Sacrament of the Lords Supper would be administred the next Lords day, and whether hee might come to it: Master <HI>Sympson</HI> answered yes, hee had the Lords Supper, and hee might come; whereupon this Master <HI>A.</HI> went, and after Sermon stayed with the rest of the company to partake in the Lords Supper, and joyning with them, received the bread; which when hee had received, there were some of the Church-members began to take notice hee was none of their Church, and there was a great stir and muttering about it, and they told him they admitted none but of their Church-way: whereupon this religi|ous man was not permitted to partake of the Cup, but was glad to with|draw, the Independents dealing with him (though a godly man, and a vi|sible Saint, because hee was not one of their members) just as the Papists do with the people, allowing them the Bread, but not the Wine. When all was done, this Master <HI>A.</HI> went to Master <HI>Sympson,</HI> and spake to him, say|ing; Sir, Did not you tell mee I might come to the Lords Supper at your Church?

On <HI>ver.</HI> 16. hee observed, New Moons, Sab|baths, meats, drinks, empty things; Sabbaths not to be observed, shadowes, and since Christs coming taken away: he said, we had deceitfull Ministery, Sacraments, Ordinances, meats and drinks, though their learned godly Mini|sters had told them, that when they had consecrated them with their sanctifi|ed garments on, they were holy, and were to be given only to those to whom they pleased, yet empty, and shadowes too. Afterwards, being asked what he meant by these meats and drinks, whether the elements consecrated to bee signes and seales to us in the Sacrament: He said, he knew no seale but the Spi|rit; and for those things, they were empty things, and of no effect. Out of <HI>ver.</HI> 11, 12. That (there being three things in Baptisme, a death, buri|all, and resurrection) Christ was baptism to us, and the outward sign needlesse.</P>
<P>The same person in private, in the house of a Reverend godly Minister, Master <HI>R.</HI> in conference asserted, That there is no Sabbath to bee kept since Christs fulfilling the Law, since no command for it in the Gospell.

Being urged in point of prayer for forgivnesse of sin with the Lords prayer: The Lievtenant said, that the Lords prayer, when Christ gave it to his Disciples, was spirituall to them, but it is not so to us. 3. The same Liev|tenant being urged with <HI>Davids</HI> practice of bewailing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in, and craving pardon, answered, <HI>David</HI> was under a double covenant, of the Law, and of Grace; we only under that of Grace: and though a believer should commit as great sins as <HI>David,</HI> murther, adulterie, there was no need for him to repent, and that sin was no sin to him, but a failing. 4. The Surgeon and the rest being told by some parties present, that they would believe that which their godly Ministers had taught out of the word: he answered, he doubted whether yet the word had been taught or no. Then the Surgeon asking what the word was: being answered, The Old and new Testament; he replied, He doubted whether those were the word or no. Then being asked what was the word; he answered out of <HI>Iohn</HI> 1.1. and told us, he knew no word but that.</P>

And speaking of the Preamble to one of their Ordinances, wherein the Par|liament acknowledged their strong engagements heartily and sincerely to endeavour the compleat establishment of puri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y and u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itie in the Church of God (for these are the Parlia|ments words, not the Assem|blies) this book cals this bla|sphemy, and saith of the Lords and Commons, For shame leave speaking blasphemy: Remem|ber the judgements upon the VVhore for her blasphemie. VVhere had the Lords and Commons this large Commission to meddle in the affaires of King Iesus so far, as to deter|mine to have a compleat esta|bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">shment of puritie and unitie?</HI></NOTE> Book lately come forth about the sixth of this moneth of May, called <HI>Tender Conscience religiously affected,</HI> fearfully abusing and descanting upon all the Ordinances of Parliament, in reference to the Directorie, Ordination of Mi|nisters, and Church-government, leaving out none but the last Ordinance about Commissioners: wherein the Parliament and Assembly are usuffera|bly reviled and railed at; and particularly the Par|liament charged with speaking blasphemy, and be|ing guiltie of many other crimes.</P>
<P>And lastly, The Sectaries are so violent, and in|sufferably insolent, that though they abuse <HI>persons</HI> or <HI>things,</HI> or do the strangest actions either against Lawes or Ordinances, if they be but questioned by any in authoritie for these things, in stead of confessing
<PB N="130" REF="114">
their offences, submitting, and carrying themselves peaceably and humbly, they will abuse and miscall Authority to their faces, yea, set out printed books a|gainst them, reproaching and reviling them to the open world; of which I might give many instances, as in the case of one <HI>Hawes</HI> committed lately by some Justices of Peace, upon two witnesses testifying words spoken by him derogatory to the second and third Persons in the Trinity; a book was printed, wherin they are reviled and clamoured against. So upon one <HI>Larner</HI>'s commit|ment, about a dangerous book entituled <HI>Londons last warning,</HI> there is a book put forth aspersing the L. Mayor of London, the Committee of Examination, and the Right Honourable the House of Peeres. And lastly upon Lievtenant-Colonell <HI>Lilburns</HI> commitment, many Pamphlets were printed, speaking bit|terly against the Committee of Examinations, and the honourable House of Comons; as <HI>Englands Birthright,</HI> severall printed Letters, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Sectaries have lately put forth two pamphlets with a picture drawne and affixed to them, greatly abusing all the Presbyterians: The first is called <HI>Dictated thoughts upon the Presbyterians late Petitions to the Parliament</HI>: the other is the book called, <HI>Tender Conscience religiously affected,</HI> propounding questions upon the Ordinances of Parliament. The maine of the picture is an heart pictured, over which is written, <HI>Tender Conscience religiously affected,</HI> with some verses over that: and under the heart, with daggers at it, stands the Pope, the Prelate, and the Presbyter in the midst of them two, with a book in his hand, where <HI>Directorie</HI> is written, Antichristian Presbyter written by him, and the Crown under his foot, he treading upon it, and a dagger in his hand, reaching at the heart of tender conscience, but a chaine with a weight hanging at his arm, whereby he is hindred and falls somwhat short of pricking tender conscience with his dagger.</P>
<P>Now I could write a book in giving observations, and making a confutation of this picture, and these mottoes, but I must studie brevitie, I will onely hint a few things.</P>
<P N="1">1. That I have been informed for certain, and it was spoken of by some Mer|chants on the Exchange, that in <HI>Holland</HI> the picture of an Independent is drawn, and set out publikely, and he is pictured thus, with God written in his mouth, the Devill written just upon his heart, and the world written and pictured as he holding it in his armes.</P>
<P N="2">2. It may be this picture of a Presbyterian will cause the picture of an In|dependent to be drawne here in <HI>London,</HI> set out with Mottoes, as also what he hath under his feet, &amp;c. and if it prove so, 'tis but just and the Indepen|dents may thank themselves.</P>
<P N="3">3. For the Picture it selfe of a <HI>tender Conscience,</HI> which they make the
<PB N="131" REF="114">
Presbyterian lifting up a dagger to stab; I am confident the Presbyterians are as truly tender-conscienced men as any in England, yea far above the Sectaries; and for the Sectaries (take them generally) they are far from being tender-conscienced men, as I shall shew at large in my Treatise against Toleration, under that head of answering that objection, <HI>that tender Consciences must be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orn with</HI>; where I shall prove by many instances they are men of large consciences, and have consciences, like to Ostrich stomachs, that can digest iron, that can digest a generall Toleration of all Religions, can beare with them that are evill, or any thing that is wicked, so it will pro|mote the Catholike Cause; and in truth, in stead of being a truly conscien|cious people, and going upon religious principles, they are a meere politike Faction, driving on strange designes, and having ends of their own.</P>
<P N="4">4. Whereas they place the Presbyter in the midst of the Pope and Prelat, how might they more truly have placed an Independent and other Secta|ries, the Independents shaking hands, and complying more with Papists and Prelats than Prebyterians, as I could prove by many instances of familiar passages and speeches that have passed between some Sectaries and Papists and Prelats, and some speeches again of Papists and Prelats of the Indepen|dents, some wherof the Reader may find in this Book, pag. 16, 126.</P>
<P N="5">5. That of the Presbyterian trampling the Crown under his feet, is a most wicked lye, and confuted in the sight of the Sun, by the experience of thes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> times; for who stand more for the Crowne, the Kings Person and Ho|nour, his just greatnesse, and his Posteritie after him, than the Presbyterian partie; and who are more against Monarchy, the Kings Person and Honour, than the Independent partie? A Sectarie indeed may well be pictured with the Crowne under both his feet, trampling it, and breaking it all to peeces, and together with the Crowne trampling the Church, Ministerie, and the Kingdome of Scotland under their feet; and for proofe of Sectaries trea|ding the Crowne under their feet, witnesse <HI>Londons last warning,</HI> commen|ded, sold, dispersed up and down by Sectaries, witnesse <HI>Walwyns</HI> an Arch-Sectaries speeches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vide <HI>p.</HI> 22. <HI>of this present book' and pag.</HI> 7.</NOTE> with othea passages of some of them, as giving over praying for the King above this yeare, laughing at them who pray for him, as <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Durance <HI>an Indepen|dent Preacher at Sandwich.</HI></NOTE>one of them praying publikely in the Church, that the King might be brought in chains to the Parliament, as speaking against his coming in or being received in but under the notion of a Delinquent, and that he deserved to die if any man did, with such like speeches.</P>
<P N="6">6. That of the Presbyter endevouring to destroy the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nder Conscience re|ligiously affected,</HI> only hindred by a great clog hanging upon him, is a wicked
<PB N="132" REF="115">
scandall; for the tendernesse, forbearance, love, indulgence of the Presbyte|rians, when they were in their highest power, and the Independents weak and low, is known to all this Kingdome; and had they been such men as the In|dependent Painter would make them, the Sectaries had never growne to this boldnesse to make such a Picture, nor these Kingdoms so troubled with them as now they are; but the truth of it is, a Sectarie may well be painted with a dagger thus running at the heart of the Presbyterians tender consciences reli|giously affected, and had they not clogs upon their arms, we should find it so by lamentable experience; they have made violent attempts against Presby|terians, and they have given out many threatning words; and certainly de|signed and comforted themselves, that ere long they should be able to crush the Presbyterians; for proofe whereof, besides instances already given in this Book, pag. 67. I shall add two or three at present: One <HI>Smart</HI> a great Se|ctarie, upon the fifth or sixth of May last, speaking against the Presbyterian Ministers, and calling them Priests, spake these words; <HI>That we hope to have, or shall have shortly the</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>This was spoken in the hearing of three Citisens, and given mee under the hand of one that heard it, who also told this</HI> Smart <HI>he would make it publike. The Presbyterians may do well to take notice, that the Sequestration of their estates, and hanging at Tyburn, was designed and counted good enough for them, if some Independents and Sectaries might have had their will. This is the libertie of conscience they must expect when the Sectaries grow so strong as to have power to effect it.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Sequestrations of the Presby|terians, as well as formerly of Malignants</HI>; unto whom one of the company replyed, that I suppose you will get a good office or place then, when the Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">terians estates shall come to be sequestred. Another Sectarie, a Bodies-seller in London (whose name I conceale, upon the entreatie of him who related it) speaking of the Ministers of Sion Colledge, said these words; <HI>Many have gone to Tyburn, who have lesse deserved hanging than those of Sion Colledge</HI>; and hee further spoke these words, <HI>that the Ministers were the cause of all our troubles &amp; stirs.</HI> This relation was given me un|der the hand of one who was an ear-witnesse, and deli|vered to me in the presence of two sufficient persons. A third man, who is for the Independents, and that way, came to a person of qualitie in the Citie of Lon|don, and taken notice of for a man of great estate, <HI>and wished him, out of his respect to him, to take heed how he ingaged or shewed him|selfe for the Presbyterians, and against the Independents, for there was no way for him to keep his estate, or to be secure, unlesse he were of that side,</HI> with other words to that purpose.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>VVorthy Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>

For your better securi|ty, I have procured the Examinations out of the Of|fice, and have transcribed one of them, which here I send you inclosed. At our late Sessions, this cause was heard, Our Recorder professed, that had he had power, hee had a great minde to hang the man for his Blasphemies; but in conclusion, hee was bound over to the next Sessions: Touching the person of this blasphe|mous wretch, one <HI>Iohn Boggis,</HI> hee was an Apprentice to an Apothe|cary in <HI>London,</HI> and came downe hither with (your good friend) Cap|taine <HI>Hobson,</HI> as his Chyrurgion. Soone after his coming into these parts hee turned Preacher; and so in a little time seducing, and be|ing seduced, hee came from Antinomianisme and Anabaptisme, to this desperate height of Atheisme. Your great Rabbi <HI>Oats</HI> told mee before his face, that M. <HI>Boggis</HI> might be his Master, notwithstanding his youth; and so highly extolled him, as if hee had beene <HI>Adam Hamagnalah.</HI> One passage more I shall acquaint you with. About a yeer since or somewhat more, this <HI>Boggis</HI> with <HI>Oats,</HI> (then of <HI>Norwich</HI>) and one <HI>Lockier</HI> a Ring-lea|der of the Anabaptists in this town came to my house, desiring some discourse with me for their pretended satisfaction. Providence so ordered it, that M. <HI>W.</HI> my fellow Minister, and one other, were with me at the present. Thus three to three we fell into debate (amongst other matters) about the power of the Magistrate in inflicting capital punishments, and taking away of life. Here|upon <HI>Oats</HI> (to whom the rest agreed) peremptorily affirmed, and stood to maintaine, That there was no such power in any Christian Magistrate over a|nie Member of a Church, unlesse first he was cast out of the Church, and so de|livered to the Secular power; no, whatever his offence was, though <HI>Murther or Treason.</HI></P>
<P>His Argument was, That all Church-Members were the Temple of God, <HI>and who so destroyeth the Temple of God, him shall God destroy.</HI> Being pressed with the Authority of that Text, <HI>He that sheddeth mans blood, by man shall his blood be shed,</HI> hee and the rest cryed out, what had they to do with <HI>Moses?</HI> They were Christs Disciples, not <HI>Moses</HI> Disciples. Being minded of the an|tiquity of this Law before <HI>Moses</HI> his time, they replyed, it was all one being
<PB N="134" REF="116">
part of the Old Testament. Withall <HI>Oats</HI> added, that that Law was fulfilled; demanding of him how, he answered, in and by Christ <HI>In as much</HI> (said hee) <HI>as Christ shed his blood, my blood is shed already; for</HI> (saith he) <HI>Christs blood is my blood, and my blood is Christs blood.</HI> At the same time <HI>Boggis</HI> being pressed by my selfe in some particulars, still his reply was, <HI>I have the Spirit.</HI> My selfe impatient of his arrogant boasting, told him. That certainly if he had that Spi|rit he pretended to, hee would not so boast of it: Whereunto (clapping his hand upon his brest) he replyed, <HI>I thank God I have enough of the Spirit.</HI> Here|upon I having enough of him, told him, that the doores were open for him, and so parted with him. The Lord direct, and assist you in all your underta|kings, and make your endeavours successefull. With my prayers, and hearty salutations, I rest</P>

You, yea we all must look to suffer for plaine dealing, especially now when as truth lieth in the streets and is trampled on by dirty feet; when as there are so many adversaries unto it, and such an Independent Combina|tion against it: The great objection against you is, You are too too vehement in your opposition; which when I heard, I remembred I had read in <HI>Luther de servo Arbitrio,</HI> the same objected to him, by old <HI>Erasmus.</HI> The Answer of <HI>Luther</HI> unto it, mee thinkes may well bee ours, yours, and yeeld us much comfort and encouragement. <HI>Quod antem, ve|hementius, egerim,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Luther de servo Arb. c.</HI> 207. <HI>p.</HI> 319.</NOTE> <HI>agnosco culpam si culpa est, imo te|stimonium hoc mihi in mundo reddi in causa Des miri|fic&egrave; gaudeo: Atque utinam &amp; ipse Deus id testimonii in novissimo die confir|maret quis tum beatior</HI> Luthero, <HI>qui tanto sui saculi testimonio commendatur,

<P>As for <HI>Cretensis</HI> (so one of your adversaries stileth his Book) I finde him still a confident man, his Challenge of all the Presbyterians one after ano|ther, assembled or not assembled in England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, in that question of the imputation of faith in a proper sense, &amp;c. sheweth so much, and also that, that he may do it as well as you did <HI>Antapol.</HI> p. 117. To whom you may say from me, He cannot so well do it as you, because that as yet we see none hath accepted your challenge, whereas the strength of him is tried (in what he did against M. <HI>Walker,</HI> and his other two Treatises of that subject) and is found weaknesse; so that untill he vindicate himselfe, we have but the words <HI>militis gloriosi,</HI> the vent of spleen against Presbyte|rians and the Assembly, say, I could tell him Presbyterians and Independents assembled, have weighed that controversie, and found his opposition therein too too light. Tell him that (though the servant is not greater then his Ma|ster, nor the authority of the Clark equall to that of the Iustice of Peace; and that when M. <HI>Gataker</HI> speaketh, M. <HI>Robrough</HI> may hold his peace, as he speaketh, pag. 26. <HI>Cret.</HI>) M. <HI>Robrough</HI> may say so much unto him in behalfe of some of those he thus challengeth, and tell him that he do no more with challenges, trouble those Masters, being in serious employments. It sufficeth a servant hath routed his forces, and is in readinesse (with Gods helpe) if M. <HI>Iohn Goodwin</HI> can but recruit, to meet him in that controversie in what|soever field. Blessed be God, he is much more inabled and imboldened to that by his attendance; so farre is he from being ashamed of that which he objecteth as a jeer: he is strong at that (as in his <HI>Recipe</HI> to M. <HI>Walker</HI>&punc; and that whole Book) the blood that runneth in that vein (as I have heard) cost him nought, he received it by tradition, he is not as yet redeemed from it; will him as a grave and learned Divine to answer M. <HI>Robroughs</HI> Animadver|sions, and after that propose his vaine-glorious challenge unto Presbyteri|ans: they and Independents will surely answer him, if between him and me there be indeed found on my part <HI>impar congressus.</HI></P>
<P>That charge of yours (<HI>Gang.</HI> p. 70. that Faith in a proper sense, is impu|ted to justification, and not Christs righteousnesse) is owned (I see) still by him.

<HEAD>A copie of a Letter lately written to me from a godly Minister in the West of England.</HEAD>
<P>WOrthy Sir, whom (though unknown to me by sight) I love and ho|nour for your love to truth, and for your zeale against the spreading infectious Errours of these times, wherein we once hoped for better things. I wrote to Master <HI>F.</HI> of some discoveries that were made to me by some re|claimed from Anabaptisme, concerning the workings of Satan to and in that way, being much affected with the relations they first gave me by word of mouth: I desired them to commit their experiences to paper while the remembrance of them was fresh with them, that they might be able here|after as well as at present, to tell what the Lord had done for their soules, in breaking such a dangerous snare as Satan with so much art and subtilty had laid for them: This upon perswasion they did, and at last gave me in about two sheets of paper close written, wherein they discover not only how the snare was laid for them, and how they were first caught and intangled with a liking of the novelty of Anabaptisme, but being caught, how they were carried on to it with the strongest violence and impulse of spirit that is ima|ginable: they also discover the sad effects and influence which that way had upon their spirits while they lay but under a liking and good opinion of it, and how it pleased the Lord to rescue and bring them off, before they were actually ingaged, and duckt into that seduced society. Sir, all these things were so fully and largely expressed in the manuscrip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> I had from them&punc; that others as well as my selfe held them very fit to be published for the publike good; and supposing they should be, I was preparing some considerations upon the passages to come forth with them. Since their coming of the
<PB N="141" REF="119">
Anabaptists, they have found their spirits in a much better frame then be|fore, and out of pitie to others ingaged in that way, have endeavoured to reclaime them. And now Sir, for my own part I must needs say, it is much that I have suffered from Opinionists of all sorts in these times, and meerly because I could not be false to my Covenant (nor I trust never shall) by a sinfull silence, when heresie and schisme do lift up themselves against truth and unity. I praise the Lord this happinesse I have, though the unkind deal|ing of these men hath somtimes occasioned much griefe of heart, and weaknesse of body to me, yet they have not prevailed in the least wise to weaken my resolutions in contending for the truth; yea the more the truth is opposed, the more earnestly I hope I shall contend for it, though it be to the utter exhausting of that small strength of body which I have: I cannot sacrifice my selfe in a better way. I know it is not necessary that I should live, but necessary it is, that truth should live and be maintained to the ut|most of our power. Me thought it was somwhat harsh to me at first (till God accustomed me to the yoke) to suffer frowns, reproaches, imprecati|ons, and all manner of hard speeches for the discharging of my conscience, and that from those whose professed principle it is that all should have the liberty of their consciences: It seems they would take liberty, but will not give it. If my conscience bids me to oppose some of their tenets and pra|ctices, and I can have no peace without so doing, how can they in reason de|ny me this liberty by their own principle? &lindx; Surely it would be a sad day to all Orthodox Christians if they should be brought to stand to the mercy the Sectaries liberty. Some of them have partly well used their liberty a|gainst me in speaking, writing, printing against me, in the most scurrilous, rancorous, injurious manner that could be, and onely for preaching that, which if I had not, my conscience I feare would have preached against me while I had lived, for holding the truth in unrighteousnesse. Sir, I will not hold you with particulars, this place hath been a troublesome place to me, for which I know whom I have to thank. I wish it may be quieter to the next Minister that succeeds me, for God is pleased by a cleare providence to open me a way to some other place. Sir, being lately at Dorchester, the Town I heard was somewhat disturbed the week before by a wandring Se|ctary, who had gathered a company about him, and preached in the Shire Hall (as I think they call it&punc;) chusing that of the Apostle for his Text, <HI>But we have the mind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Christ.</HI> Afterwards, through too much pride, and too little wit, the poor fellow was so ill advised as to challenge M. <HI>Ben</HI> to a pub|like dispute <HI>imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r congressus Achihi.</HI> offering to make good the lawful|nesse of private mens preaching, which challenge was accepted, but how the
<PB N="142" REF="120">
Opinionist was foyled by that worthy Minister (fitter to grapple with that Punies Instructors) was easily perceived by all understanding hearers. The godly people of those parts have been so well catechized and grounded heretofore, that the Opinionists complain they can make no work with them. Certainly the good old English Puritan (which Mr. <HI>Geere</HI> doth so well characterize) is the Novellists greatest enemy, or rather the Novellist his. &rindx; Alas, how sad is the destiny of Orthodox Christians, that no times will favour them? We have not yet lost the sense of what we suffered heretofore by those wicked Prelats, whom God hath therefore cast out as an abomina|ble Branch; and surely if all the Orthodox in the Land should bring in their severall complaints of what they have suffered since by turbulent Opinio|nists, it would fill the world with wonder, and the Reformed Churches abroad, who cannot but sympathize with us, with much heavinesse of spirit in our behalfe. Heretofore it was counted a crime to preach against pro|fanenesse, as sporting on the Lords day, and the like; and now as great a crime to preach against Heresies. Only let me acquaint you with one thing I have observed, This veine of persecution for the most parts runs along in the same persons; they who most countenanced profanenesse and supersti|tion heretofore against Orthodox Ministers, are the same men who under a forme of godlinesse, without the power, do now countenance Heresie and Schisme against it; but Sir, let nothing discourage. It it given to us, not only to beleeve, but to suffer; <HI>but hee that shall come will come, and will not tarrie:</HI> and in the mean while it is enough for us that Christ reigns.</P>

<P>THere is a young man who lives in London, and not far off the Exchange, who went not long since to <HI>Lams</HI> meeting-place, to see and hear what they did there; and when he was come, found many of them reasoning and conferring about strange opinions: and among the rest, there was one Se|ctarie who maintained and affirmed, &rindx; That he was Jesus Christ. At which this young man was so offended and troubled in his spirit, that hee (upon the place, and to his face) spake much against him for his blasphemy: This fellow still maintained it stiffely, and told this young man hee would powre out his judgements on him, and damne him for opposing and speaking thus against him. This young man was so affected with it, that when hee came home, he told it his Father and other friends: and being asked by some, whe|ther he thought the man was in his wits or no, this young man replyed, Yes sure, for he spake sensibly, and to the things that were spoken of, though in this blasphemous abominable way.</P>
<P>Many Sectaries have distrubed godly conscientious Ministers in the Pul|pits,
<PB N="143" REF="120">
standing up in the verie face of the Congregation, and speaking to them, giving them the lye, charging them with false Doctrine, calling them Antichristian Ministers, and such like: Of some of these I have given instan|ces in my late Book, pag. 102, 103, 104. And to add a few more, Mr. <HI>Andrews</HI> of Wellingborough had the lye given him whilst hee was preaching; and many Ministers have been put by preaching, and kept out of their own Pul|pits by force of Arms, Captains and Troopers coming up into the Ministers Pulpits with their swords by their sides, and against the mind of Ministers and people: Thus <HI>Paul Hobson</HI> hath done in Northampton-shire, Bucking|ham-shire; and thus at Ravensden in Bedford-shire a Souldier went up a|gainst the mind of the Minister; and here in London, the face of the King|dome, at Christ-Church there have been many affronts offered, as jeering and scoffing in the midst of the Sermons, speaking loud against things deli|vered, to the disturbance of those who have sate neer: and now lately at Christ-Church, on Tuesday the 20. of April, just upon concluding my Ser|mon, and going to my last Prayer, up stands one Colonell <HI>Washington</HI> of Hartford-shire, (so his name and place is related to be) and spake openly against what I had preached, that I had not rightly given the sense of that Parable of the Tares, and that I was a false Prophet, or <HI>Beware of false Pro|phets.</HI> Now if the Sectaries will do thus to the Presbyterians whilst they are in their minoritie, and underlings, what will they do when they come to be in their Kingdome, to be encreased in number and power above the Presby|terians? But now on the other hand, let Independents and Sectaries give any one instance that the Presbyterians, when they have come to hear them preach, (though they have preached their erroneous opinions, and for liber|tie of conscience, and against Presbyterians, and all this in the Presbyterians Pulpits and Churches) that ever the Presbyterians have stood up and made disturbance in the publike Assemblies, or carried themselves uncivilly and scoffingly in Sermon time towards them.</P>
<P>There is one <HI>Gorton,</HI> who was a great Sectarie in New-England, holding many desperate opinions there; a copie of which, given by Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> of New-England (that writ the Book called <HI>The bloudy Tenet</HI>) unto a Reve|rend Minister now at London, I have seen and perused. Now this <HI>Gorton</HI> with others being banished out of the Patent of the Bay, and when they were gone, holding and venting strange and horrid opinions, whereby they highly dishonoured God, and did hurt and mischiefe to some of the people in the Patent, and under the New-England government; the Governour and Magistrates sent a company by force of Arms (though they were in a place, as it is thought, out of their Plantation and Patent) to bring them to
<PB N="144" REF="121">
Boston; who accordingly, being too strong for <HI>Gorton</HI> &amp; his company, brought them to Boston: and when the Governours had them in their hands the Court sate upon them what to doe with them; and there were some motions and consultations (as I and other Ministers have been informed by some that are come from New-England) about putting them to death, or what other punishments to be infl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cted on them for their blasphemous opinions. But how <HI>Gorton</HI> escaped, whether because the place they fetched him and the rest from was not in their Patent, or what other reason, I know not; onely this I am assured of from divers hands, that <HI>Gorton</HI> is here in London, and hath been for the space of some months; and I am told also, that he vents his opi|nions, and exercises in some of the meetings of the Sectaries, as that he hath exercised lately at <HI>Lams</HI> Church, and is verie great at one Sister <HI>Stags,</HI> excer|cising there too somtimes.</P>
<P>There is one <HI>Iohn Durance</HI> an Independent, (whom I mentioned a little before) who preaches a Lecture on the week day at Sandwich in Kent, and hath a Lecture at Canterbury too, and would have had a Lecture also at Do|ver for the farther spreading of Independency: but by the godly Ministers of Dover opposing it, and writing up to London against him, such meanes were used, as he was put by, and kept from coming thither: Now among many other of his pranks,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A godly Minister who heard it will depose it, if called, and so will many more who heard it.</HI></NOTE> the Reader may take notice of these; He hath at Sandwich in the Church publikely prayed to God two or three severall times, that the King might be brought up in chains to the Parliament: upon which prayer, one or two of Sandwich went to M. <HI>Durance,</HI> to know what his meaning was in that prayer: upon putting the question, M. <HI>Symonds,</HI> an Independent Minister in the same towne, and his great friend (but more politick) being with him, answered, M. <HI>Durance</HI> meaning was that the King might bee brought up in chaines of gold: whereupon M. <HI>Durance</HI> replyed, that was none of his meaning; but he meant, he might be brought in chains of Iron. In a Sermon one time this <HI>Durance</HI> told the people hee was sorrie he had spent so much time, or lost so much time in reading or turning over the Fathers: and yet he said he honoured the Fathers as much as anie man. This man after his preaching at Canterburie, hath the use of a great roome neare the Cathedrall, where manie resort to him; and he takes occasion to build them up in Independency. Not long since M. <HI>Durance,</HI> on his Lecture-day, just before the last day of publike Thanksgiving in the Countrey, preaching in one of the Churches in Sandwich, told the people he would finish the Text he was then preaching upon on the Thanksgiving day, and that in the after|noone, in a private house: whereupon, when he had done, M. <HI>Sherwood</HI> a
<PB N="145" REF="121">
godly Minister in whose Church he preached, turned himselfe to the Congre|gation, saying, Mr. <HI>Durance,</HI> you shall not need to do so, you shall have the libertie of my Pulpit, I here offer it you; and if you may have libertie of the publike Church, I hope you will not go into corners. VVhereunto Master <HI>Durance</HI> publikely replyed, hee would not preach in the Church, but was re|solved of his way; and accordingly in the afternoon, when the people went to the publike exercises to Church, Mr. <HI>Durance</HI> went to a private house, and two or three hundred people after him, to heare him preach in private.</P>
<P>I have many other remarkable stories and passages of the Sectaries, proved by witnesses, by Letters under their hands, and the notorietie of the things themselves, of their horrible uncleannesses, forsaking their husbands and wives, fearfull defraudings, and seeking by desperate wayes to cozen and de|ceive; as also of their strange conceits: That there is a Prophet arisen, who is shut up for a time, but at the end of this Summer is to come forth with power to preach the generall Restauration of all things; which Prophet hath given a roll forth already into some hands, in which roll many things are written, and whoever hath that roll, hath the spirit of prophecie: He hath appointed some to be Publishers and Prophets, and to go to Jerusalem to build it up, where <HI>Abraham, Isaac,</HI> and <HI>Iacob</HI> shall meet them from Heaven; and these persons thus sent unto Jerusalem, are assured they shall never dye, with many other of this kind.

Certainly, neither we, nor our Fathers before us ever heard or saw such evils of blasphemie, heresie, &amp;c. in this Kingdome, as wee have done within these two or three last yeeres: The worst of the Bishops and their Chaplains, when they were at worst, were Saints in comparison of many of the Sectaries of our times, and would have abhorred (as bad as they were) such opinions and practices which some of the Secta|ries magnifie, cry up, and pretend to do by vertue of new light, the Spirit, and as a matter of great perfe|ction, as for instance; A mans or womans forsaking their owne husbands and wives, and taking others at their pleasure, out of pretence of casting off Antichristian yokes, the pleading for a general Toleration of all Religions, yea Blasphemies, &amp; denying a Deitie, out of pretence of libertie of conscience.

<P>HEnce then from all that I have laid down of the Sectaries of our times, of their errours, heresies, blasphemies, strange practices, and their wayes of managing them, we may learne what is like to become of them and their way, and what their end will be; namely, confusion, desolation, and being brought to nought suddenly, as in a moment, and if ever God spake by me, I am confi|dent he will curse this Faction of Sectaries in England, and cast them out as an <HI>abominable branch:</HI> Me thinks I see their day a co|ming and drawing neere;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Schismatici non sunt longaevi.</NOTE> Heretikes and Schismatikes do not use to be long-lived: no heresie (as <HI>Luther</HI> speaks) uses to overcome at the last.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nulla haeresis unquam, &amp;c.</NOTE> What is become of the Arrians, Donatists, Novatians, Pelagians, &amp;c? though they were like a mightie floud, over-running and drowning all for a time, yet like a floud they were quickly dried up; and so will the Sects now: and we may expect it so much the sooner, because the visible symptomes and fore-runners of destruction are upon them.

much crossed and troubled to to see things as they are; The <HI>Scots</HI> have beene sorely visited with Sword, Pestilence in their own Land, obstructed, reproa|ched, evill intreated by many in this Land: the Assembly, the godly Mi|nisters and people of the Kingdome, despised, scorned and abused severall wayes, yea, deserted, and looked upon with an evill eye, as if the troublers of <HI>Israel,</HI> and worse then Malignants, so that they have beene forced manie a time to cry out to God, Heare O our God, for we are reproached; Now great prosperitie, successe in a bad way, and in the use of bad meanes, as lyes, scandalous reports, under-minings, plottings, false-dealings, &amp;c. is a great Symptome of destruction both to particular persons, and to a partie: whom God intends certainely to destroy, he fattens before, and lets them bee verie happie, thereby to prepare them for the day of slaugh|ter: whom hee meanes to doe good unto in the latter end and deliver, he afflicts and laies them low before, laies the Foundation deep that he may build high, and for this let the Reader consult with these foure places of Scripture, <HI>Ier.</HI> 12. 1, 2, 3. <HI>Psal.</HI> 37.7, <HI>and</HI> 10.35, 36. <HI>Psal.</HI> 73.3, 4, 5. <HI>and</HI> 18, 19, 20. <HI>Psal.</HI> 92. 7. the sum of all which places is to teach us, that the more men prosper in a bad way, and flourish more then ordinarie, having what their hearts can wish, bringing all their devices to passe, the more sure they are of being puld out as sheep for the slaughter, and prepared for the day of slaughter, and that within a little while, they shall not bee, nor their place found, but brought to desolation as in a moment, and utterly consumed; and then when they are at their height of flourishing, then is it that they shall be destroyed for ever; great prosperitie is but a lightening before death, and as a great calm which presages the more dreadfull storme and tempest.</P>
<P N="4">4. The great plotting of the Sectaries, laying their counsells deep, contri|ving and working continually night and day by all kinde of waies and means, and all kind of instruments to effect their worke, and to carrie on their way; I do not think this manie hundred yeares there hath been a more cunning, plotting, undermining generation in the Church of God then our Sectaries, or more plots and devices of all sorts on foot, more irons in the fire within so few years, as hath been, and is among them: there's nothing they doe but they have a design in it, they conceive many plots at once to effect it, they have plot upon plot, and lay snare upon snare: <HI>Machiavel</HI> and the Jesuits are but punies and fresh men to them. I am confident they had so laid their plots, cut out their way, removed the rubs, prepared all things, so as that they had set their time, by which they should effect their ends, and speak out what they would have: Now God delights to bring to naught plots, to disappoint the devices of mens hearts, to blast and blow upon tricks and under-boord

workings, to take the wise in their own craftinesse, and wherein men deale proudly to be above them: the ripening, growing big of plots, is commonly the fore-runner of the downfall of the plotters, and the miscarriage of their plots: for the further clearing of which the Reader shall doe well to consi|der what God speakes in <HI>Iob.</HI> 5.12, 13, 14. <HI>Psal.</HI> 37.12, 13, <HI>Isa.</HI> 29.15.16. <HI>Isa.</HI> 30.1, 2. and indeed God is such an enemy to plots, devices, tricks, that he will crosse and disappoint his owne children in their workings, devisings, and contrivances even for good, when they are too plotting, anxious, or de|light and please themselves too much in them; and this he does often, lest they should attribute the events of things to their counsell, care, &amp;c. and that the worke may appeare to be of himselfe, and not of men, that God may be knowne to be <HI>Deiu activus &amp; non passivus,</HI> as <HI>Luther</HI> expresses it upon a like occasion, and that God doth not use to call <HI>Martin Luther</HI> or anie of his Saints to be his councellor, but that he doth all things according to his own counsell; hence we are commanded to be carefull for nothing, or thought|full, but in everie thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let our requests be made knowne to God: Now if God will go quite crosse and contrary, to the counsells, workings, of his servants for the maintaining his Church and truth, and bring about all quite another way, then he will much more carrie the counsells of the froward headlong and make them meet with darknesse in the day time, and grope in the noone day, as in the night.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Sympt.</HI> of the certaine destruction of the Sectaries is this, That Inde|pendencie and Sectarisme in <HI>England</HI> is a meer Faction, a partie grown to this height upon particular interests, nourished and favoured all upon politike grounds and ends: Independencie now is no religious conscientious businesse, but a politike State Faction, severing and dividing it selfe upon other private interests from the publike interests of this Church and State, and the inte|rest of both Kingdoms, united by Covenant: In a word 'tis just such ano|another Faction as the Arminians was in the Netherlands. I believe that se|ven or eight years ago Independencie and the Church way had somwhat of Religion and conscience in it, manie then falling to it much upon those grounds (though even then there were other ends in it also,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Antapol p. 21, 28.</NOTE> as I have showne in my <HI>Antapologie.</HI>) But now since these times of troubles and difference betwixt King and Parliament, these foure years last past, wherein men have seen some probabilitie and possibilitie, in these times of warre and unsettlement of things, to bring about and effect those things they could not hope for before, it hath been and is matter of fa|ction, particular aimes and ends, and not of conscience and pietie, as all wise men may see, and is apparent by these particulars:</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="125">First 'tis not carried on as a way of God, as a matter of Religion and Con|science, in Gods way, and with Gods means; but carried on altogether with policie, art, plots, trickes, equivocations, mentall reservations, lies, falsenesle, doing anie thing though never so unjust and unrighteous, if it will further and advantage, that way, and hinder its opposite, <HI>viz.</HI> Presbyterie, and the settlement of the Church; yea, declining and forsaking the profest principles that way, and going contrary threunto, in razing the verie fundati|ons of Independencie, and the Church way.</P>
<P>Secondly, There are multitudes of persons in all places, who doe not so much as know or understand anie of the principles of Independency and th&eacute; Church way; yea that hate most of those principles if they were tied to live according to them, that yet are great sticklers for Independencie, and the Sectaries, yea, are the heads and patrons of it in all places, and upon all occasi|ons, and this is observed by manie wise men, that take those who now are friends for it, and stand for it upon all occasions, among them all there is not one in ten that conscientiously and in his judgement holds that way to bee of God, or is an Independent, which cleerly showes 'tis a Faction.</P>
<P>Thirdly, All other errours and opinions, Sectaries of all sorts (as well as Independents) are encouraged, nourished, favoured, and the worst of them though being so abominable, 'tis not anie policie to appeare for them; yet one way or other, under one notion or other, are pleaded for, dealt gently with, either delayed and put off, or brought off by one meanes or other, and are free|ly suffered to grow and increase, and no way taken to suppresse or discourage them, which cleerly showes Independency is a Faction, and hath other de|signes then that of Conscience, in furthering the growth of all sorts of Secta|ries, holding tenets against their principles as well as ours, by Licensing their Books, &amp;c. and upon all occasions, shelters and protects all sorts of them.</P>
<P>Fourthly that Independencie is a Faction, and not matter of Conscience, appeares because all these following sorts and ranks of men come in unto it; 1. Needie, broken, decaied men, who know not how to live, and hope to get somthing, turn Independents and sticklers for i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. 2. Gail<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ie, suspicious and obnoxious men, who have been or are in the lurc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and in feare and danger of being questioned, or have bin questioned, they turn Independents to escape que|stioning, or if questioned, that so they may come off the better, Independency being a Sanctuarie and the horns of the Altar where many obnoxious persons fly and are safe; and many of these guilty persons that they may merit the more prove fiercer Independents and Sectaries then manie others. 3. Some who have businesses, causes, and matters depending, strike in with the Independent Sectaries, pleading for them, that so they may finde Friends, be sooner dis|patcht,
<PB N="153" REF="125">
fare better in their causes, &amp;c. 4. Ambitious, proud, covetous men, who have a mind to Offices, places of profit, about the Army, Excise, &amp;c. turn about to the Independents, and are great zealots for them. 5. Liber|tines and loose persons, who have a desire to live in pleasures, and enjoy their lusts, and to be under no government, they are fierce and earnest for Inde|pendents, and against Presbytery. 6. All wanton-witted, unstable, errone|ous spirits of all sorts, all Hereticks and Sectaries strike in with Independen|cy, and plead they are Independents. 7. Such who have no minde to peace, nor to the settlement of things, either out of hope, whilest things remain un|setled, Bishops and former times may come in again; or that love to fish in troubled waters, or are afraid to lose Offices and Places that may fall with the ending of these troubles, these persons strike in with Independents, and side with them. 8. Many who in our Churches are discontented at the faithfull preaching of their Ministers close to their consciences, at their Ad|monitions and Suspensions from the Sacrament, because loose, scandalous, or because of some difference upon their Tithes, or such like, forsake our Assem|blies, and betake themselves so Independents and Sectaries, of which I could give divers instances; all which showes the Church-way and Independency to be nothing else but a Faction: Now Factions and Parties in Kingdomes and Commonwealths, though they may prevaile to a great height, and grow for a time, especially in troublous unsetled States, in the Springs and Falls of Kingdoms and Commonwealths; yet when they come to be discovered, laid open, and come to some head and ripenesse, they use to fall and be cast out: If we consult with the Scriptures, or with the Histories and Chronicles of Kingdomes, as the French and English, &amp;c. wee shall finde the strongest, powerfullest Factions and Parties both in Churches and States, who have had divided interests from the Publike, have come downe and misera|bly perished: and we may see this fully made good in the Anabaptists of Germany, the Arminian Faction in the Netherlands, and our late Prelati|call Faction, who though they were all growne so high, as they hazzar|ded the ruine of the Countreyes and Commonwealths wherein they a|rose, yet they all fell and were brought downe, and so shall it be with this Sectarian Faction; can they think that either God, or these Kingdoms will suffer these men long, or that the people will be alwaies bewitched with them? no, the eyes of men will be open, and they will be discovered every day more, and we shall see them falling down like lightning.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Symps.</HI> Their reaching after, and medling with all kind of persons and things, grasping of all at once, labouring to ingrosse all Offices, places,

Now in all States and Kingdoms Polupragmaticalnesse in some persons, greedinesse and over-hastinesse to have all, and thereupon offending and provoking many, hath been a fore-runner of their fall: I shall onely instance in this King|dome, and of the late times, which all remember. What it was that ruined the Bishops and their party, but their grasping and medling with all at once, Church and Commonwealth together, England and Scotland both, provo|king also all sorts of persons against them, Nobility, Gentry, City, Mini|sters, common people? whereas (as many wise men would often say, and comforted themselves in the worst of those times) if the Bishops and that party had dealt but with a part at once, one Kingdome onely, as England, or or the Church alone, or Commonwealth alone, letting the other Kingdome be quiet to enjoy their Lawes, and suffering men to enjoy Religion and their Ministers, though they had some pressures upon them in Commonwealth, yet in all probability in time they might have had their wills: but now the Bi|shops and that party oppressing both Church and Commonwealth at once, grasping to have all, they will lose all; and we see what is befallen the Bi|shops and that party: so our Sectaries medling with both Kingdoms at once, with Church and Common-wealth together; and having provoked all sorts of men, Nobility, Gentry, Ministers, City, People, our Brethren of Scotland: will not be able to stand long, but King, Parliament, Scotland, City, Ministe|ry, Countrey, will be so against them, as they must fall, let who will or can hold them up.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Sympt.</HI> of the downfall of the Sectaries, is the great sinnes and wicked|nesse of that party, who are even now ripe for judgment, and their iniquities almost full; and I am confident, that for this many hundred years there hath not been a party that hath pretended to so much holinesse, strietnesse, power of godlinesse, tendernesse of conscience above all other men, as this par|ty hath done, that hath been guilty of so great sinnes, horrible wickednesse,

The Sectaries are full of <HI>Ephra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"></HI> gray haires (though they will not know it) and these following sinnes and courses presage their ruine, <HI>viz.</HI> their deep hypocrisies and pretences of Religion and Conscience meerly to serve their lusts, and to bring about their own ends, their perjuries and breach of solemne Covenant with God, making nothing at all of it, their great unthankfulnesse and ill use of Gods mercies and delive|rances, their great ingratitude and unkindnesse to men, particularly to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Brethren of <HI>Scotland,</HI> their blood guiltinesse in destroying the lives of ma|ny by dipping weakly and ancient persons in rivers in cold seasons, and in the destroying of so manie soules by Errours and Heresies and drawing them from their faithfull Pastours, their horrible uncleannesses and lusts, their fearefull despising and mocking of all Gods faithfull Ministers, and Ordinances, their oppressions, injustice, and unrighteous dealings with ma|nie they have had to doe with and where they have anie power, their base self-seekings, seeking their owne things, their honour, profit, advance|ment of their Faction under pretences of selfe-denyall, and the publike good, their holding of damnable Heresies and all kinde of abominable Errours, their horrid blasphemies against God, Christ, the Scriptures and all his Ordinan|ces, their Machiavillian policies, Jesuiticall equivocations, falsnesse and treache|rousnesse, their underminings and laying snares for men, their countenancing standing for the unworthiest vilest of men, so they will be for their faction, their justifying and pleading for a Toleration of all religions, and consciences, even to blasphemies against God and his Word, their inventing of lies and rai|sing scandalls upon the worthiest and innocentest men, as Ministers and others to blast them with the people, their prophanenesse and loosenesse of life in ma|king nothing of the Lords day, daies of Fast and Thanksgiving, nor of holy du|ties, as praying, &amp;c. their carnall confidence and trusting in arms of flesh, their using of wicked and unjust waies, and means to compasse their ends, not stan|ding upon any rules, or keeping to any principles, so it may advantage them, violating bonds of friendship, going against the lawes of Nations, joyning with the worst of men against good men, labouring to sow divisions among brethren, raising evill reports, fomenting jealousies, and using all waies in their power to ingage the two Nations in a war one against the other, not caring to hazzard the ruine of all for the upholding of their faction. Many of the Secta|ries have forfeited all principles of ingenuity and conscience, and will not stand upon any thing that may probably doe their worke for them: they will take counsell of <HI>Baalzebub</HI> the God of Ekron whether they shall recover, use the Devills meanes, as lying, breach of promises, joyning with wicked men, &amp;c. for pretended libertie of Conscience and upholding their way.

<P N="8">8. <HI>Sympt.</HI> is this, When God hath at some times testified against them, and spit in their faces, as by laying open their nakednesse, and fully disco|vering their ways, by some books written, by some Sermons preached by godly Ministers, by casting some rubs in their way, in stirring up the Citie of London to appeare against them, or in disappointing some of their pur|poses by strange and unexpected passages of his providence from Heaven, yet upon none of these occasions have they repented of their deeds to give God glorie, or humbled themselves before his Ministers speaking to them from the mouth of the Lord, or abated of their spirits; but contrariwise, have gnawed their tongues for pain, blasphemed the more because of their pains and sores, and stirred up themselves with so much the more industrie and subtiltie, to plot and work by all kind of wayes and meanes to heale their wounds: and I could give many instances, how upon such books co|ming forth, and upon such acts of providence, which a man would have thought should have made them give over, they have been more resolved, active, desperate, betaking themselves to evill wayes and strange courses for the saving of themselves, as aspersing and raising scandals and false reports upon the persons whom they think have wounded them, as in the weekly Pamphleters venting some desperate passages, and putting forth strange books upon the nick of things, with many other wayes, all which wise men cannot but observe; in which courses they have been like <HI>Balaam,</HI> Numb. 22. going on their way resolvedly, though the Angell of the Lord have stood in their way with a sword drawn, and their feet have been crushed against the wall.

to their faces, they do not return nor seek him for all this: This is the fore-runner of destruction in the Antichristian partie, Revel. 16.8, 9, 10, 11. And this was a fore-runner of destruction in the Prelates and that partie; that after their great and long prosperitie and successe, when God did by wri|ting, preaching, raising up of witnesses testifie against them, and did by other acts of his providence crosse them, in raising up the Kingdome of Scotland against them, yet they would not give in, nor abate; and when a peace was concluded with Scotland upon the Kings first going into the North, and they might have enjoyed their honours, greatnesse, for all that, they wrought so upon the Kings returne, as to procure those Articles to be burnt by the hand of the common Hang-man, and the war to go on, which proved their ruine and fatall destruction.

And that God will honour the Kingdome of Scot|land, and the Church-reformation according to their way, to bring down the Sectaries, let the Reader consult with M. <HI>Brightman</HI> (a man of a propheticall spirit) in his Exposition on the Church of Philadelphia, Rev. 3. 8, 9, 10. where he shews, that Church to whom so many promises are made, to be the reformed Churches of Geneva, France, Scotland, and those who are according to that way of Reformation in Doctrine and Church Government; and among ma|ny things observed by M. <HI>Brightman</HI> on that place, I shall only point at two.</P>

<P>Now if wee consider well of these two things, 1.

<P>First, That God will make them come (viz. those who are the Antitype to those Jews, the Sectaries, Anabaptists, Independents, that whole Faction) and worship before their feet, and to know that God hath loved them; that is, they shall overcome and triumph over these Sectaries: and however they have been hitherto abused and scorned by them, neither have these unthank|full men acknowledged my love from that singular gift of zeale, pietie, which I bestowed upon thee; yet I will adorn thee with those things which are in great account in the world: thou shalt have victories over these

<P>HEnce then from all these Errours, Heresies, Blasphemies, and Practises of the Sectaries, we may see what a great evill and sin separation is from the communion of the Reformed Churches, and how highly displeasing to God for men to make a Schisme and Rent in the Church of God in a time of Refor|mation, God punishing the Schisme and Separation of our times with so many Heresies, Blasphemies, wicked practises, &amp;c. as I have laid down in this and my

former Book, wherein God witnesses from Heaven against the present separa|tion in giving men up to great spirituall judgements and evills; and indeed God testifies more against the Sectaries of our times, then against the old Brow|nists and Separatists, leaving the Sectaries of these dayes to fall into greater Errours, Heresies Blasphemies, and more pernicious Practises then the former, few of them in comparison falling either to those Opinions or Practises which generally the Separatists do now, but held to their first principles more; a great reason whereof I conceive to be this, the old Separatists having greater scandals, and more just occasion of separating then the new the old Separatists being like men stealing upon need, or some want, the new like those who steale upon wantonnesse, and for their pleasure, the onelike wives and children going away and leaving harsh, bitter, hard, unkind husbands and parents, the other forsaking loving and kind husbands and Parents allowing them all things sit|ing, and that can reasonably be desired) their sinne was not so great then as now, and so the punishment not so great: There are two wayes to judge of the greatnesse of sinnes, and of Gods displeasure against them, either by the nature and kind of them, viewing them <HI>formaliter</HI> in their formality, or in the effects and fruits of them <HI>effective</HI>: Now this Corallary leads me to judge and speak of Schisme and Separation in the latter, and among all punishments the effects and fruits, which declare the greatnesse of any sinne, spirituall judgements and punishments are the sorest and sadest. The punishment upon the Heathen, (<HI>Rom.</HI> 1.21.24 <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) <HI>when they knew God, for not glorifying him as God, and for their idolatry, is giving them up to uncleanenesse and vile affections, to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient, suffering them to be fild with all unrighteous|nesse, wickednesse, covetousnesse, malitiousnesse, deceit, malignity, debate, to be proud, inventers of evill things, without naturall affection, Covenant-breakers, implaca|ble, &amp;c.</HI> (2. <HI>Thes.</HI> 2.11.)

<P>And for a conclusion of this Corallary, O that any particular Members of Parliament who are for pretended liberty of conscience, a Toleration of Sects, favourers of Sectaries, and out of those principles hinder all they can the set|ling of Religion and Government by civill sanction, would often and sadly meditate upon this Scripture, and be wise now (whilest there's time) thus to serve the Lord, lest suddenly, when they least think of it, they perish from the way, and God make them examples, for adhering so pertinaciously to the Secta|ries and that party. They may read in Ecclesiasticall Stories what hath befalle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Princes for not serving the Lord in fear, and kissing his Son; and they see be|fore their eyes the many evils that have befallen the King, and the great straights to which hee hath been reduced for favouring too much the Popish and Prelaticall party against the minde and humble desires of both his King|domes: and can particular persons think (who are not Kings, but under that title of Judges) that they can prosper long in standing for a Sectarian faction against the minde of both Kingdomes, and that the Kingdomes will not see and desire to understand how it comes about? and by whose means 'tis, that wee having taken a Covenant for uniformity in Doctrine, Government, &amp;c. and for extirpating of Heresie, Schism, and the Parliament having declared and made Ordinances for Presbyteriall Government, and declared in some De|clarations and Remonstrances against Anabaptists, Brownists, preaching of men not ordained, and against leaving particular persons and Congregati|ons to their own liberty; that yet all things should be done quite contrary with an high hand? For may not now whoever will both preach and gather separated Churches, print and act against Presbyteriall Government; and for all sorts of Sectaries? Yea, such persons are countenanced, preferr'd in all places, and to all kinds of Offices and imployments (which makes many turn Independents) and the most zealous cordiall men against Sectaries are displa|ced, or discountenanced, or obstructed, &amp;c. These things doe seem strange and against all reason, that the Parliament, professing and declaring one thing, yet the quite contrary in all things of this nature should be done daily in Citie and Countrey. In the worst times, when the King was most mis-led by the Councels of Prelats and evill men about him, there were not actions more contrary in many Ministers of State and other persons to Proclamations and

<P N="3">3. Come out from these Sectaries, this Babell, lest being partakers of their sins, you be partakers of their plagues also; for these Sects (as I have shewed you in the second Corallary) must be destroyed and cast out: and not onely out of this Church, but out of all the Christian world, and that either as the lesser Antichrists, the fore-runners of the great Antichrist, or together with him as a part of Antichrist, the tail of the Beast; and then all the friends and lovers of Sectaries, the merchants who were made rich, and traded in the commodities of the Sectaries, shall cast dust upon their heads, and weep and waile when they see all that is come upon them. And for a conclusion of this Corallary, I shall wind it up with that sad and patheticall exhortation of M. <HI>Brightman</HI> to the Separatists of his time, applying it to our Sectaries now:
<Q>There is in the Church of England a twofold great good, the prea|ching of the Word, and the administration of the Sacraments, in either of which Christ imparts himselfe celebrating a mutuall feast with them; hee is first received of us by the hearing of the Word, then he doth againe re|ceive us in the Supper of his body.

<P>HEnce then from all I have laid downe in the first and second Part of <HI>Gan|graena</HI> of the Practices, Proceedings, and ways of the Sectaries, we may see and observe the great difference between the carriage of the Indepen|dents, and our Brethren of Scotland: our Brethren of Scotland have been constant and true all along to their first Principles, to the ends they alwayes held out, to the grounds which they declared they went upon, to the Cove|nant they have taken, and that in every branch and part as well as some, in standing for the Kings honour and just greatnesse, &amp;c. as well as standing for their own Liberties; in standing for uniformity in Doctrine, Worship, Dis|cipline and Government in the three Kingdomes, as for preservation of their own, &amp;c. and neither all their sufferings, hardships, difficulties on the one hand, nor all the offers, temptations, flatteries on the other hand, have made them decline from their way, either in their owne Countrey, or since they have been in Covenant with us. I challenge any man in all this nine or ten yeares of their troubles, to charge them justly with falsnesse or breach of Covenant in pretending one thing, and intending another, in forsaking for|mer Principles, and falling upon new, according to any advantages offered them; but now the Independents and Sectaries have been inconstant, uncer|tain, and unstable in all their wayes, crying up and extolling our Brethren of Scotland to the heavens, and afterwards as much casting them downe, pre|tending a regard to some branches of the Covenant, as extirpating Popery and Prelacy, but not minding others, as maintaining the Kings Honour, his just power and greatnesse, the extirpating of heresie, schism, the endeavouring the nearest conjunction and uniformity between the three Kingdoms in Go|vernment, Discipline, &amp;c. not certain to any principles or ends they have propounded, except those of Anarchie, and pretended new light; not well knowing what they would have, but changing their minds, and framing their wayes according as they have seen their opportunities and advantages; And because I observe it hath been one great part of the designe of the Sectaries, yea and as the maine <HI>medium</HI> to effect their ends by, the aspersing and reproa|ching of the Scots (the Sectaries looking upon them <HI>as that which letteth, and will let untill it be taken out of the way</HI>) which hath been therefore with all industry, artifice and vigour prosecuted ever since the battell at Marston

Moore, and more especially since the moulding or new modell of the Army: I shall therefore (to undeceive the people) as in the sight of God, out of pure conscience, speak a few things of our Brethren of Scotland, and show particularly some differences between them and the Sectaries.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Scots still upon all occasions have improved and made use of all victories, successes, and advantages put into their hands (as the coming in of the King now to them) for the good of both Kingdomes, and for effecting the ends declared in the Covenant, not for anie particular ends, as to get pos|session of Newarke, or to be revenged for affronts offered them, or injuries done them by the Independent party, or to increase divisions, jealousies, dis|contents between the Nations: But now the Sectaries have made use of all advantages, and of all successes they have had, and of all events that are fal|len out for the increase of their own partie, and effecting their particular ends divided from the interests of both Kingdomes, and the ends expressed in the Covenant; yea to increase and further jealousies, discontents, differences between the two Kingdomes, by blowing up and aggravating upon all occa|sions all things against the Scots, by railing against and speaking evill of the Scots in all companies and places, by aspersing them in manie printed bookes, (carefully spread and dispersed abroad by the Sectaries) and by many false re|ports and other dangerous insinuations against the Scots vented in weekely newes bookes (the Pensioners of the Independent party) and particularly since the Kings coming to the Scottish army, many things have beene rela|ted and spoken of by the weekly Pamphleters, which reflect upon our Bre|thren of Scotland, and some upon the Kings Majestie (which must needs seeme strange and be verie offensive to all good and wise men) and so much the more, the King being come in, and in the Parliaments Quarters. I can|not stand to name the particulars, nor to animadvert upon them now, but re|ferre the Reader among others, to peruse <HI>Mercurius Britanicus, numb.</HI> 130. <HI>The Scotch Dove, num.</HI> 134. <HI>Moderate Intelligencer, num.</HI> 62, 63. neither shall I much need to doe it, for I doubt not but they will recant shortly, and being mercenarie fellowes, wee shall see them within a few weekes ring the changes.</P>
<P N="2">2. Our Brethren of Scotland have borne with much patience and long-suffering, quietnesse of spirit and humili<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ie, infinite reproaches, evill speakings against in City, Countrey, by all sorts of Sectaries, passed by also manie af|fronts, neglects, abuses offered them; and when manie things in this King|dome have gone crosse to their desires, hopes, and the Reformation they ex|pected, and divers things have succeded to the content and desire of the Se|ctaries, yet they have put up all, waiting upon God for a change, said little;
<PB N="174" REF="136">
neither the Commissioners for Scotland, nor anie particular person of their Nation having put forth intemperate books against those whom they concei|ved the Authours and chief Engines in these matters, but have borne to ad|miration (considering they left their peace, and incurred the displeasure of their native King to come in to our help, and lay under such great sufferings in their owne Countrey) all the evill surmisings, scandalls, reports, jealousies raised of them, disgraces and scorns, without anie breaking forth. But now the Sectaries, upon everie little occasion of being crossed in their way, as by Ordinances coming forth against anie of their principles and practices, (though God knowes they have been little put in execution) by calling in question any of their partie, though most deservedly and justly, by petitions put up against the Sectaries, how proud, how impatient have they beene? what strange words have they given out? what meetings have they had? and what railing Pamphlets have been written one upon another, against Parliament, Assem|bly, Citie.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Scots upon all occasions and opportunities have beene forward for peace, moving for peace and the settlement of the Church, desirous of Propo|sitions to be sent to his Majestie: But now manie Sectaries could not endure to heare of peace, not of the Kings coming in, nor of the settlement of the Church, they have looked so much to their particular ends of profit, increase of their party while things were unsetled, that they have alwaies expressed themselves to the contrary, fearing their way could not thrive nor stand, if once things should come to be setled, and the Government and the peace con|cluded of. Manie more differences might be showne between them; but I must draw to an end, and the understanding Reader may by these easily hint at more, and it concernes the whole Kingdom now at this time wisely to con|sider and lay things together concerning the different carriage of our Brethren of Scotland and the Sectaries, that so a good understanding may be between the two Nations for the putting a speedy end to our troubles and distractions in Church and State, and that we may not by mis-understanding of things, nourishing jealousies, beleeving false reports, serve the designes of some parti|cular men, to put us into a new warre, and occasion new differences now that (blessed be God) our worke is even done, and the ship richly laden come into the haven. And to stop the mouths of Sectaries and Malignants forever, and to possesse us of the reality, honesty, faithfulnesse of our Brethren of Scotland, consider but what we have found them all along experimentally from first to last, and let any man instance (if he can) in any one action, from the beginning of our troubles, wherein the State of Scotland hath broken with us, or beene unfaithfull: Their going out of this Kingdome to their own Countrey when

How hath he discovered all their treacheries? although they be in them|selves (comparatively at least) a poore people and of little strength (as the Church of Philadelphia was) yet they have kept the word of Gods pati|ence, and God hath kept them in the houre of temptation; God therfore is with them.</Q>
Well, I say it is happie for England, that we are joyned with them in Covenant, for we needed them as much now as ever before, and we are as much beholding to them in regard of our divisions, many of us not knowing what we would have; and in regard of the many Sectaries among us, and the height they have risen unto, as ever we were before, for their help against the Popish, Prelaticall, and Malignant partie; and therefore happie England, both for the present and for the future, that now wee are coming to a Peace, we are so joyned and wrapped up in Covenant with Scotland, that the Peace and Vnion is not of England alone, but of both Kingdoms;
<PB N="177" REF="137">
and that this is our advantage I shall commend to the Readers consideration some particulars out of the Speeches of Mr. Solicitor, a prime able Member of the House of Commons, and Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> a chiefe man among the dissenting Brethren Mr. Solicitor speaking of the benefits that will redound to this Kingdome, and the advantage we shall have by a nearer Association with the Scots, and by their coming in to this purpose for our assistance, showeth that certainly they are many.</P>
<P><HI>The third is this, that whosoever we doe come to a Peace, whom Gods time is come, that we shall have one, yet their coming in, in all probability it will cause us to have a better, a surer, and a better grounded Peace, then if they doe not come in. And likewise what peace soever we have, that it will be perpe|tuated, and be the securer for us and our posterity to reap the benefit of it. But how is it like to be, when there shall not onely be our owne Kingdome, but a Bro|ther Kingdome, an entire Kingdome, one of the same Religion with us, one that loves their liberties as well as we, when they shall bee ingaged in point of interest with us, when the same Law, the same Acts of Parliament that shall compose the differences, when if it be broken on our parts in any thing that con|cernes us, they cannot conceive but that it may be their case the next day, be|cause it all depends upon one Law, one and the same title, and their interests is the same; So that if there were nothing else in it, but that we were like to have the better peace and on better termes, and whatever it be 'tis likely to bee kept the better to us and our posteritie, if nothing else were in it, that were much to our advantage: surely if by some considerable summe of money, wee might have brought in, and have them at the end of this Peace, and intere|sted in it as well us our selves. Master</HI> Burroughs <HI>saith, how happy should wee be, if wee might have them in a neere union with us? And a people that have carried themselves with as great honour and faithfulnesse, with as great wisdome and order in the most difficult worke that ever a people did undertake in those by and intricate paths that were before untrodden. Certainely, that they undertooke at the beginning of their worke, but a few years since, it could not but bee looked upon with the eye of reason, as the most unlikely worke e|ver to have proceeded, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> any worke hath ever done, and yet how hath the Lord been with them, and with what wisdome and graciousnesse have they carri|ed it.</HI> So that from the consideration of all I have said in this Corallary and from these passages in these speeches, tis good by all meanes to preserve the union of England and Scotland, and seeing we shall be so happy in a neere union, and God is so much with them, and carries them thorough with so much wisdome and graciousnesse, and that wee shall have the

better Peace, and have it the better kept, by having them at the end of it, and interested in it as well as our selves; let's hearken to no Sectaries nor Independents false surmisings, evill reports, and scandalls, cast upon our Brethren of Scotland, but pray and seek by all means a more near union and communion betweene that Kingdome and this, for there is a blessing in them; and for my part I had a great deale rather fall and perish (if the will of God were so) with the Kingdome of Scotland, and the Presbyte|rian party in England, standing for the Covenant and the truth professed in all the Reformed Churches, then to grow and flourish for a while with the Sectaries standing for a Toleration of all Sects and Opinions, yea, then to be a King among them, as <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Leyden</HI> was at Munster.</P>
