<HEAD>To the Queenes most excellent

<P>_MAY it please your Maie|stie,
so long as breath is in
my breast, life in the hart,
and spirit in the heade, I
cannot hold the hand fro~
penning of some accepta|ble
deuice to your Maie|stie,
not to compare (in mine own ouer wee|ning)
with the rare Poets of our florishing age,
but rather counterfeyting to sette foorth the
workes of an extraordinarie Painter, that hath
drawne in a pleasant conceite, diuers flowers,
fruites, and famous Townes: which pleasant
conceite I haue presumed (this Newe-yeeres
day) to present to your Maiestie, in signe and
token that your gracious goodnesse towardes
me oftentimes (and cheefely now for my pen|cyon)
<PB REF="3">
shal neuer goe out of my remembrance,
with all dutifull seruices, belonging to a loyall

praying for your prosperous preserua|tion
and Royall estate, I proceede to my pur|posed

<HEAD>A pleasant conceite.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE Painter thought, to please his owne delite,</L>
<L>With pictures faire, as poore <HI>Pigmalion</HI> did:</L>
<L>But staring long, on kindly Red and White,</L>
<L>He found therein, a secrete nature hid.</L>
<L>A frayde to fall, like Flie in flaming fire,</L>
<L>He finely cast, cold water on desire,</L>
<L>So shaping grapes, and graine another while,</L>
<L>At his owne workes, the Painter gan to smile.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Because with grapes, the byrds were once begield,</L>
<L>And men might dote, on goodly corne and graine:</L>
<L>At more conceits, this merry man he smield,</L>
<L>As though he had, possest some Poets vaine,</L>
<L>As <HI>Petrarch</HI> had, who did his tryumphs make,</L>
<L>In sweetest sorte, for Lady <HI>Lawraes</HI> sake.</L>
<L>Thys Painter tooke, in pensell such a ioy,</L>
<L>As hee could make, much matter of a toy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A rush a reede, a feeble feather light,</L>
<L>Was ground enough, for him to worke vpon:</L>
<L>What euer came, to mind to view or sight,</L>
<L>Stoode for good cloth, to clap hys collours on.</L>
<L>But his most skill, was how to sette forth flowers,</L>
<L>And showe at full, trym Townes and stately Towers.</L>
<L>Not eu'ry Towne, he meant not now to tuch,</L>
<L>For that their names, cannot auaile him much.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="4">
<L><HI>NOrth-hampton</HI> first, the Painter tooke in hand,</L>
<L>As cheefest work, his pensel lately drew:</L>
<L>Because the plot, did come from forraine land,</L>
<L>In that faire forme, as doth appeare to you.</L>
<L>Not roughly heaw'd, as tymber is in haest:</L>
<L>But smoothed well, and with great honor graest.</L>
<L>A woorthy peece, of workmanship so rare:</L>
<L>With golden Fleece, <HI>North-hampton</HI> may compare.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>WArwicke</HI> he drewe, in collours sad and graue,</L>
<L>In elders dayes, a noble name it bore:</L>
<L>It builded was, on vertues rare and braue,</L>
<L>As auncient seates, and Citties were of yore.</L>
<L>The walles were reard, on constant Rock ful fast,</L>
<L>That durst abide, the brunt of enuies blast.</L>
<L>The streetes were paude, with plainnes mixt with grace,</L>
<L>Where good report, fild vp each empty place.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The houses hie, shone bright against the sun,</L>
<L>And all the walkes, and steps were smoth &amp; cleere:</L>
<L>This famous Towne, great loue &amp; laud hath wun,</L>
<L>As by the brute, of world doth well appeare.</L>
<L>It stands and staies, on honors pillers large,</L>
<L>Sure props that can, beare vp a greater charge,</L>
<L>When <HI>Warwicke</HI> thus, the Painter sette in frame,</L>
<L>He turnd his hand, to Townes of stranger name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>BEdford</HI> he made, in goodly sumptuous sort,</L>
<L>With collours ritch, bedeckt and cleere set out:</L>
<L>Like Towne of state, as strong as warlike Fort,</L>
<L>With wise aduice, well senced round about,</L>
<L>Not to be won, the watch and ward was such,</L>
<L>Ne fraude nor force, durst not attempt it much.</L>
<L><HI>Bedford</HI> is blest, for from that house and soyle,</L>
<L>Sprunge many a branch, that neuer yet tooke foyle.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="4">
<L>OLde <HI>Lyncolne</HI> now, that stands on mighty Mount,</L>
<L>Yet lowe in earth, the first foundation lyes:</L>
<L>He drew for that, it was of great account,</L>
<L>And lifted vp, in fauour to the skyes.</L>
<L>The best we know, did loue olde <HI>Lyncolne</HI> well</L>
<L>In former age, her beautie did excell.</L>
<L>Of latter tyme, her credite was not small:</L>
<L>For some doe say, that <HI>Lyncolne</HI> past them all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>KYldare</HI> came now, to minde among the rest,</L>
<L>A right fayre seate, and so sette foorth it was:</L>
<L>As Gods aboue, and nature had her blest,</L>
<L>Which seem'd to sight, as cleere as Christall-glas.</L>
<L>From Hawthorne bough, whose blossoms brings in May</L>
<L><HI>Kyldare</HI> did come, and ioyes therein this day.</L>
<L><HI>Kyldare</HI> commaunds, more men than thousands do,</L>
<L>Yet dutie bids, it be commaunded to.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>HArtford</HI> he calld, vnto remembraunce than,</L>
<L>A Towne where Tearme, is kept as cause doth craue:</L>
<L>It fauourd is, and likt of each good man,</L>
<L>It dooth in world, it selfe so well behaue.</L>
<L>Gallant and gay, and gladsome to the sight:</L>
<L>Framde from the stock, that still growes bolt vpright.</L>
<L>Most meeke of minde, and plaine in eu'ry part:</L>
<L>Where dutie ought, show loue and loyall hart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOwe <HI>Huntington,</HI> was drawne in order due,</L>
<L>As did become, the value of that seate:</L>
<L>The honour olde, the name is nothing new,</L>
<L>The worth not small, the soyle and place is great.</L>
<L>The buildings fayre, and stately too withall,</L>
<L>Stands strong and sure, as doth a Brasen wall.</L>
<L>Full glad to please, both God and man indeede,</L>
<L>And prest to serue, the Prince in time of neede.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="5">
<L><HI>WOster</HI> that once, like <HI>Huntington</HI> did looke,</L>
<L>Stoode still farre off, as it would not be knowne:</L>
<L>Yet soft and fayre, in ranke her place she tooke,</L>
<L>She worthy was, of right to haue her owne.</L>
<L>In fame and praise, and worldly honor both,</L>
<L>In noble name in vertue grace and troth.</L>
<L>If Painter had, not toucht this Towne no way,</L>
<L>God knowes thereof, what might good people say.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>SOuth-hampton</HI> came, in view and iudgement now,</L>
<L>A Hauen towne, of great esteeme and praise:</L>
<L>Of nature good, and well disposed throw,</L>
<L>And nobly hath, bestowd both yeeres and daies.</L>
<L>A princely Porte, where shyp shall safely ryde,</L>
<L>Against all stormes, how euer turnes the tyde.</L>
<L>From <HI>Mountague,</HI> whose trueth no time might staine,</L>
<L><HI>South-hampton</HI> tooke, her forme and manner plaine.</L>

<L><HI>PEmbroke</HI> a pearle, that orient is of kind,</L>

<L>A gemme more worth, then all the gold of Ind,</L>
<L>For she enioyes, the wise <HI>Mineruaes</HI> wit,</L>
<L>And sets to schoole, our Poets eu'ry where:</L>
<L>That doth presume, the Lawrell crowne to weare.</L>
<L>The Muses nine, and all the Graces three:</L>
<L>In <HI>Pembrokes</HI> bookes, and verses shall you see.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOwe <HI>Shrewsbrie</HI> shal, be honourd as it ought,</L>
<L>The seate deserues, a right great honour heere:</L>
<L>That walled Towne, is sure so finely wrought,</L>
<L>It glads it selfe, and beautifies the sheere.</L>
<L>Her beautie standes, on bounty many waies,</L>
<L>That neuer dyes, but gaines immortall praise.</L>
<L>Her honor growes, on wished well won fame:</L>
<L>That people sounds, of <HI>Shrewsbries</HI> noble name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="5">
<L><HI>OXford</HI> came last, like sober Sibbill sage,</L>
<L>Whose modest face, like faire <HI>Lucyna</HI> shone:</L>
<L>Whose stayed lookes, decors her youthfull age,</L>
<L>That glisters like, the Alablaster stone,</L>
<L>Her blotlesse life, much laude and glorie gate,</L>
<L>And calld her vp, to be a great estate.</L>
<L>The Diamond, dooth lose his daintie light,</L>
<L>And waxeth dim, when <HI>Oxford</HI> comes in sight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THese Townes and all, the people dwelling there,</L>
<L>And all the rest, that loues theyr Country well:</L>
<L>And all true harts, and subiects eu'ry where,</L>
<L>That feareth God, and doe in England dwell,</L>
<L>Salutes with ioy, and gladnes this New yeere,</L>

<L>Still waites on her, as handmaides ought to doe.</L>
<L>With long good life, with peace and perfect rest,</L>
<L>And all good gifts, that euer Prince possest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Painter stayed so, yet rising from the floore,</L>
<L>To Courte then did he goe, to Presence Chamber doore:</L>
<L>And peeping throw the same, he saw in euening late,</L>
<L>Full many a noble Dame, sitte neere the cloth of state.</L>
<L>Where the stood 5. faire flowers, whose beauty bred disdaine,</L>
<L>Who came at certain houres, as Nymphs of <HI>Dians</HI> traine.</L>
<L>Those goodly Nimphes most gay, like Goddesses diuine,</L>
<L>In darkest night or day, made all the Chamber shine.</L>

<L>In Priuey-chamber sure, some faire sweet saints are shrind.</L>
<L>The Painter as he might, with that did him content,</L>
<L>And wondring at the sight amaz'd he homeward went.</L>
<L>Where he is drawing still, some works of stranger kind,</L>
<L>If this may gaine good will, for plaine true meaning mind.</L>

<L>So shall you find, the meaning of his thought,</L>

<L>Wrest things aright, but doe no further goe.</L>
<L>In ballance thus, wey words with equall weight,</L>
