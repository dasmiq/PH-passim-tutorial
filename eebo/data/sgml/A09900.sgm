<HEAD>The manner of proceeding in the <HI>CHANCERIE.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD>THE CHANCERIE.</HEAD>
<P>_NOtwithstanding the prac|tice heere before this time hath bin, That no <HI>Sub poena</HI> should be sued forth of the Court of <HI>Chancerie,</HI> without a Bill of Complaint first ex|hibited. Yet laterly, for the ease of all Suitors and Sub|iects, it hath beene thought good, that euery man may haue a <HI>Sub poena</HI> out of the same Court, without any Bill first exhibited.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="7">This <HI>Sub poena</HI> is the leading processe of this Court, by which the party Defendant against whom the Complaint is intended, is summoned and required to appeare, and make answere to the Complainant, vnder a certaine paine, and at a certaine day to come.</P>
<P>The dayes of <HI>Returne</HI> heere, are the vsuall <HI>Returnes,</HI> as in the ordinary <HI>Almanack,</HI> Or else a <HI>Sub poena</HI> may bee returnable at a certaine day, after any the sayd vsuall <HI>Returnes,</HI> or the great Feast dayes, from whence the <HI>Returnes</HI> take their denomination, So that you must adde (<HI>Prox.</HI>) in place where cause shall require.</P>
<P>As if the Feast Day be to come: Then it must be, <HI>Prox. Futur. in vnum mensem&punc;</HI></P>
<P>But if the Feast day bee past, then it must be a <HI>die Paschae in vnum mensem prox. futur.</HI></P>
<P>And the like to other <HI>Returnes,</HI> before or after other Feast dayes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sub poena</HI> being by the Complaynant or some other by him appoynted, serued, and retur|nable in manner (as aforesayd:) The Complai|nant hath lliberty to put in his Bill, vntill the day following the fourth day after euery the sayd <HI>Returne</HI> (if the <HI>Sub poena</HI> bee returnable vpon the certaine <HI>Returne</HI> day.)</P>
<P>And you must account the Returne day, and the fourth day after it, for two of the sayd foure dayes.</P>
<P>And if the Bill bee not fyled on the next day
<PB N="3" REF="7">
after the sayd fourth day: The Defendants At|tourney (hauing the <HI>Sub poena</HI> or <HI>Labell</HI> thereof, wherewith the Defendant was serued, Or an Oath that the <HI>Sub poena</HI> was serued) hee may get fitting Costs in euery such case.</P>
<P>When the Defendant hath so got Costs, he may haue a <HI>Sub poena</HI> whereby to commaund the Complaynant, presently vppon the sight thereof, to pay the defendant or the bringer ther|of, the sayd costs; (as aforesayd.) And if the com|playnant do refuse to pay the sayd costs, ac|cordingly: Then the Defendant may, vppon <HI>af|fidauit</HI> made, that the <HI>Sub paena</HI> for costs was ser|ued, haue an Attachment directed to the She|riffe of the county, to attach the Complaynant therefore.</P>
<P>And vpon returne made by the Sheriffe, that the Complaynant cannot bee found, an Attach|ment with Proclamation may bee sued forth a|gainst the complaynant.</P>
<P>And that Proclamation beeing likewise retur|ned by the Sheriffe (as aforesayd.</P>
<P>Then a Commission of Rebellion may bee sued forth against the complaynant.</P>
<P>But on the contrarie side, if the Complainant do put in his Bill, And the Defendant appeareth not, the next day after the costs day.</P>
<P>Then the Complainant (vpon Oath made that the Defendant was serued with a <HI>Sub paena</HI>) may haue an Attachment, and farther Processe vpon
<PB N="4" REF="8">
like Returnes, (as in case aforesayd.)</P>
<P>Where note, that the party which maketh Oath that hee serued the <HI>Sub poena:</HI> Or that the <HI>Sub poena</HI> was serued, must sweare as followeth.</P>
<P>That he deliuered the <HI>Sub poena</HI> to the Defen|dant.</P>
<P>Or he shewed the <HI>Sub poena</HI> to the Defendant, and deliuered to him a note of the day of his appearance.</P>
<P>Or hee left the <HI>Sub poena</HI> at the Defendants dwelling house, where the Defendant most abi|deth.</P>
<P>Or hee shewed the <HI>Sub poena</HI> at the Defen|dants dwelling house to his Wife, or some of his seruants, and there left the <HI>Labell</HI> of the <HI>Sub poena,</HI> or a note of the day of his appea|rance.</P>
<P>Or hee must sweare that he heard the Defen|dant confesse that he was serued with <HI>Sub poena.</HI></P>
<P>And if the Defendant do appeare within the time limited.</P>
<P>Then the Complainants Attourney may giue vnto the Defendants Attourney, on the said day after the Costs day, a Rule, that the Defendant do make answere to the Complaynants Bill, by the same day seuen night then next to come. This Rule and day giuen, must bee entred into the Register.</P>
<P>And if the Defendant do not answere by the prefixed day so entered.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="8">Or if hee doe not otherwise satisfie the Court by sufficient cause and occasion of the delay:</P>
<P>Then the Complainants Attourney may take forth an Attachment against the Defendant.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD><HI>The Causes whereby the Defendant may satisfie the Court of his sayd delay in answere, are these for the most part.</HI> (viz.)</HEAD>
<P>HE cannot make direct answere, without sight of his Euidences or VVritings which are in the Country:</P>
<P>Or hee cannot answere without conference had, first with some person named in the sayd Bill&punc;</P>
<P>Or with some person whom the matter toucheth:</P>
<P>Or that the Defendant is not able to trauell.</P>
<P><HI>Of euery which reasons aforesayd, Oath must be made.</HI></P>
<P>ANd vpon Oath so made:</P>
<P>Or by an especiall motion made for this purpose:</P>
<P>The Defendants Attourney may procure a
<PB N="6" REF="9">
<HI>Dedimus potestatem,</HI> directed to certayne com|missioners in the countrey, to take the defendants answere there.</P>
<P>And the cause whereupon this <HI>Dedimus potesta|tem</HI> is granted, must be entred into the Register.</P>
<P>So likewise in case where the defendant doth not answere within the limited time, and an At|tachment is therefore awarded against him: The Clerke which maketh the same Attachment, must enter it into the Register; shewing the cause wherefore it was granted.</P>
<P>But if no day bee giuen to the defendant to answere: Then the defendant hath liberty to an|swere at any time during the Terme.</P>
<P>And if hee doe it not within that time: Then an Attachment may bee sued foorth against him of course. And the same, with the cause thereof, must bee entred into the Register: (<HI>viz.</HI>) That the defendant appeared, and departed without answere.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Sub paena</HI> bee returnable so neere vnto the end of the Terme, that there cannot bee a day gi|uen to the defendant to answere, hee must at his perill answere by the same day seuen-night fol|lowing the day of his apparance, although it bee in the Vocation. For the <HI>Chancerie</HI> is alwayes o|pen.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Sub paena</HI> bee Returnable on the last <HI>Returne</HI> day of the Terme it selfe: Then the defendant is at Libertie to appeare the first
<PB N="7" REF="9">
returne of the Terme Following:</P>
<P>But if it be a day certaine, although the same bee the last day but one of the Terme, yet the Defendant must appeare, and answere by that day seuen-night, next Following the sayd Appa|rance.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Sub paena</HI> bee returnable immediately, though it be serued on the last day of the Terme, so it bee serued before the rising of the Court; The Defendant must also appeare and answere, by the same day seuen-night.</P>
<P>And if the defendant make Oath, that hee cannot answere without Writings, &amp;c. or con|ference with some other person: Or if hee haue a <HI>dedimus protestatem,</HI> and Commssion to make his Answere: Hee must, at his perill, procure his Answere to bee put in, before the day after the first Costs day of the next Terme Follow|ing; vnlesse it be Trinity Terme: And then, and in such case, it must be put in the second day: or else the complainants Attourney may, vpon such default, make an Attachment against the de|fendant, and enter the same into the Register, for that hee hath not Answered by the day pre|fixed.</P>
<P>Or in other case, That he appeared, and depar|ted without Answere: Or otherwise, That he did not returne the <HI>dedimus potestatem</HI> at the day pre|fixed, &amp;c. and as the case shall require.</P>
<P>And though the custome hath bin heretofore,
<PB N="8" REF="10">
That by reason that the Defendant may abuse this liberty giuen to him (as aforesayd) in delay|ing the Complaynant by <HI>Demurrer</HI> in Law: No such <HI>Demurrer</HI> should bee allowed; yet is now permitted, That the Defendant may, by his Answere returned by <HI>Dedimus potestatem, De|murre</HI> in Lawe: For that hee, not appearing in person at the first, his Counsaile in his absence may not <HI>Demurre,</HI> though the Complainants Bill bee insufficient: Because euery <HI>Demurrer</HI> must bee deliuered into the Court by the De|fendant in proper Person, and not by his At|tourney, except in Cases where the defendant is not able to appeare in Person. In which Cases it is vsed; That the defendant may deli|uer his <HI>Demurrer</HI> to the Commissioners: Who, though they bee by the expresse words of their Commission, to receiue the defendants Answere vppon his Oath: yet, if the defendant deny to answere, they are to certifie the same, with the reasons by him alleadged, wherefore hee will not answere vpon Oath; leauing the same to the con|sideration of the Court: And they are to take and returne such Answere as the defendant shall deliuer vnto them.</P>
<P>But where the Defendant hath before ap|peared, and taken coppy of the Complaynants Bill, and hauing had conference with his Coun|sayle therevpon, is by him resolued that hee can|not make a direct Answere, by reason of some
<PB N="9" REF="10">
matter in the sayd Bill layd to his charge, which hee cannot cleare without fight of Euidences, VVritings, or Conference with some Person; There is no reason, that after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ime so giuen to the Defendant, from the day of his Appearance, vntill the beginning of the next Terme following he should be admitted to <HI>demurre</HI> to the Com|playnants Bill:</P>
<P>For if there had beene any cause of <HI>Demur|rer,</HI> Hee might haue demurred at the day giuen him to Answere; So that the Complaynant might haue had time to haue had the opinion of the Court, whether the <HI>Demurrer</HI> were good, or not.</P>
<P>So, if the Defendant, after such time so taken, doe <HI>demurre</HI> in Lawe; The Complaynant shall haue an Attachment of course, as though no an|swere at all had beene put in: The sayd Attach|ment is to be entred thus, (<HI>viz.</HI>) For that the de|fendant hath not answered by the day to him gi|uen, therefore an Attachment, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Vpon the returne of this Attachment, hee may haue the like Proces as aforesayd.</P>
<P>And in case where there be more Defendants, e|uery defendant shal be punished alike, for his owne like offence;</P>
<P>Except in case where a <HI>Sub poena</HI> is granted a|gainst a man and his Wife: In which case a man shall bee vnder punishment for his VViues Of|fence.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="11">For if a man bee serued with a <HI>Sub poena</HI> in <HI>London</HI> against him and his Wife, (shee being in the Countrey) yet if hee doe not satisfie the Court, by some of the courses before mentio|ned, as well for his Wife, as for himselfe (hee bee|ing here in person (an Attachment shall be gran|ted against him and his Wife, as though he had neuer appeared, which Attachment shall be en|tred; For that <HI>A. B.</HI> VVife vnto <HI>C. D.</HI> hath not answered according to a day to them prefixed: Therefore an Attachment is awarded against <HI>C. D.</HI> and <HI>A. B.</HI> his wife.</P>
<P>If the Complaynant dye, his Heyre or Execu|tor, who hath the interest of the thing whereof hee complayneth, may put in a Bill of <HI>Reuiuor</HI> a|gainst the Defendant, his Heyre or Executor, as the case shall require.</P>
<P>Also, It is to bee remembred, that if the Complaynant Exhibite his Bill against a Man and his VVife, for matter which wholly con|cerneth the VVife: VVhereunto they make An|swere, and after answere made, the man dyeth, The Complaynant cannot proceede in that suite against the VVoman, without a Bill of <HI>Reuiuor,</HI> because the woman shall not bee constrayned to stand to that Answere, which shee together with her Husband, or solely (as Wife vnto the Man) made to the Complaynant, for that shee was then vnder Couerture.</P>
<P>And after her husbands death (she being sei|zed
<PB N="11" REF="11">
or possessed of the thing in Controuersie as in her former estate) may (if shee please) make a new answere, and shall neuer bee bound or con|cluded by the Answere which shee made in her Husbands life-time, or that shee was then vnder Couerture. And yet (if shee so please) shee may stand to that former answere of hers, and proceed in that suite accordingly.</P>
<P>But if the Complainant exhibite a Bill against a <HI>feme</HI> sole, whereunto she maketh answere, and afterwards marrieth, the Complainant may pro|ceed against her Husband and her, without any Bill of <HI>Reuiuor:</HI> And her husband shall be bound by that answere which she made before marriage, because shee shall not be admitted to take aduan|tage of her owne act.</P>
<P>VVhere (on the contrary) if a <HI>feme</HI> sole exhi|bite her Bill of Complaint, wherevnto the Defen|dant answereth, and afterwards she taketh an hus|band, her husband and shee shall not proceede a|gainst the Defendant, without a bill of <HI>reuiuor;</HI> because her suite is abated by her owne act, where|of the Defendant may take aduantage.</P>
<P>And if a Man and his Wife exhibite a bill of complaint, whereunto the Defendant answereth, and the man dyeth, the woman shall bee at her choyce whether she wil exhibite a new bill, or pro|ceede vppon the Former: And the Defendant shall be bound to his Answere made to the Man and his VVife.</P>

<P>The Suruiuor of them may proceed against the defendant, without any Bill of <HI>Reuiuor.</HI></P>
<P>And in all cases where a Bill of <HI>Reuiuor</HI> is re|quisit, after the sayd Bill exhibited, and a <HI>Sub pae|na</HI> serued on the Defendant to that purpose: The Complainant shall be in the same case, as he for his Predecessors was, at the time when the cause of <HI>reuiuor</HI> accrewed, vnlesse the Defen|dant shall appeare vppon the sayd <HI>sub paena,</HI> and by way of answere shewe good cause to the con|trary: which cause must be, That the Complay|nant in the Bill of <HI>reuiuor,</HI> is not Heyre, or Exe|cutor, nor standeth in the like case, nor hath the like interest, or the like cause of complaint, as be|fore in the Former suite:</P>

<P><HI>The Words are these,</HI> (viz.)</P>
<P>BEcause Time and Experience may discouer some of these Rules to be inconuenient; And some other fit to be added hereunto; Therefore his Lordship intendeth in euery such case, from
<PB N="59" REF="35">
time to time, to publish such <HI>Reuocations</HI> or <HI>Ad|ditions,</HI> as they shall offer themselues.</P>
<P>Howsoeuer I take it, there is not much alteration had in them; it may bee there is some Addition: But for the <HI>Roller</HI> side (as vnto the making of <HI>De|crees,</HI> and granting of <HI>Iniunctions</HI>) which was heretofore exercised alike there, as in Court, or on the Lord <HI>Keepers</HI> side (which I conceiue grew by the connexing of the Lord <HI>Keepers</HI> Office, and Master of the <HI>Roles</HI> in the same person) I cannot say how the case stands at this present, hauing with|drawne my selfe now these seauen yeares past, from any practice in the Lawes in any kind.</P>
<P><HI>And because the Confirmation of Ordinances and by-Lawes, made for the better gouern|ment of Societies Incorporate, do for the most part passe through the hands of the Lord <HI>Keeper,</HI> or Lord <HI>Chancellor</HI> for the time being, according to the Statute of the nineteenth of K. <HI>Henry 7.</HI> Therefore, and for that it is onely the path of a very few trauelliug in the Lawes; I thinke good to write according to mine owne Practice therein (as followeth.)</HI></P>
<P>IF a Corporation bee newly erected, and is to haue also Ordinances <HI>de nouo,</HI> made for the
<PB N="60" REF="36">
better gouernment of their Company, or Body: They must first make a perfect draught of them by aduice of Counsaile in a Paper-booke.</P>
<P>Your Counsaile would be both learned in the Lawes of the Land, the Prerogatiue of the King, the Subiects right; and the Priuiledges, Powers and Customes of the great body of the City, or Towne corporate, wherein you are sub incorpo|rated as Brethren of a Trade, Mystery, or Oc|cupation.</P>
<P>For any Ordinances made eyther against the Lawes of the Land, or the Prerogatiue, are not onely voyd in themselues, but farther punishable in those who execute them, notwithstanding any confirmation whatsoeuer. And therefore com|monly in all Patents and Charters of Incorpora|tion, there is a speciall clause of <HI>prouiso</HI> in this point and to this purpose.</P>
<P>And I doe heerein indigite at two manner of Ordinances, vnder which the Commonalties of corporation do much grone and complaine their pressures.</P>
<P>The one is a presumption and intrusion vppon the Birth-right of a Free-borne Subiect (<HI>viz</HI>) the Imprisonment of their bodies, for breach of an Ordinance of their company (a thing most vnlawfull, and vnreasonable, and yet too fre|quently practized by too many of them.) For colour whereof, I haue seene a Warrant <HI>Dormant</HI> lying in the Halls of some companies;
<PB N="61" REF="36">
vnder which they subscribe the names of whom they list to commit; and then deliuer him to an Officer, who attends them at their Court for the purpose; and so it is not pretended to bee their owne act, but the will and commandement of a greater Magistrate.</P>
<P>Or an Intrusion vpon the Subiects Birth-right, by denying him to seeke Law and Iustice before the King the Fountaine of Iustice, in his Court at <HI>Westminster.</HI></P>
<P>Or to set vp and vse his Trade, after hee hath arriued at his Freedome by honest seruice, accor|ding to the Lawes of the Land, and the ancient custome of the place.</P>
<P>Or to take a House for his best convenience, ad|uantage and accommodation of his Trade:</P>
<P>Or the like.</P>
<P>The other Agreeuance which I poynt at, is a Consumption and effusion of the purse and estate of the Subiect, by grieuous Fines, Amercya|ments and Impositions, and by laying of Offices vpon them, which draw great expence, in Fea|sting and profusenesse; of which I shall take oc|casion in a more fitting place, to speake and write at more liberty.</P>
<P>I proceed with my Direction in the passing of any such Ordinances.</P>
<P>The Paper booke beeing perfected by such a|ble Counsaile, you are to draw your Petition in the names of the Maister and Wardens, in name,
<PB N="26" REF="37">
and in the behalfe of the whole Company, to bee directed and deliuered with the sayd Booke to the Lord <HI>Keeper</HI> or Lord <HI>Chancellour,</HI> desiring; Where as ith ath pleased his Maiesty so to In|corporate you, and to giue you power to make Orders and Constitutions for your better gouern|ment; which Orders are by the Statue of the nineteenth of King <HI>Henry</HI> 7. to bee perused, exa|mined, and allowed, by the Lord <HI>Keeper,</HI> Lord <HI>Treasurer,</HI> and the two Lord Chiefe Iustices of either Benche, or three of them at least, which prouision you are ready to obserue and performe on your parts.</P>
<P>It may therefore please his Lordship to giue order to the two Lords chiefe Iustices, to per|use, examine, and make the same fit and worthy the confirmation and allowance of his Lord|ship, and themselues, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Heerevppon, his Lordship giue order vnder your Petition: That the two Lords chiefe Iu|stices do accordingly peruse, examine and make them fit, as is desired.</P>
<P>They the sayd Lord cheife Iustices doe by vertue of that Order and Warrant peruse the same; and after they haue so altered, added, or sustracted, as they shall thinke fit.</P>
<P>Then their Lordships giue order to one of their owne Clerks, to write them ouer fayre a|gaine into a Paper booke coppy-wise. VVhich when they haue exactly examined with the for|mer
<PB N="63" REF="37">
so by them reformed, They subscribe the same, and send them seal ed vp backe againe to the Lord <HI>Keeper:</HI> who vpon the opening there|of, and sight of the approbation of the Lords chiefe Iustices, doth likewise giue order in wri|ting, at the Foote of the sayd Booke subscribed with his hand, That the same be forthwith faith|fully ingrossed in Parchment (and in the <HI>Chance|ry</HI> hand) by such an one as it shall please the two Lords chiefe Iustices to appoynt therevnto. And that they giue him testimony of the due perfor|mance thereof, by the confirmation of the same vnder their seuerall hands and Seales, and soe the Lord <HI>Keeper</HI> seales the Booke vp againe, and returnes it to the Lords chiefe Iustices, who giue direction for the engrossement, according to the order aforesayd.</P>
<P>And when the same is so engrossed, and exa|mined with the Paper booke, they set their se|uerall hands and Seales thereunto, and deliuer it to your selues, to carry to my Lord <HI>Keeper,</HI> Vppon sight whereof, he vseth also to Seale and subscribe the same.</P>
<P>But I pitty the case very much, that there is no Inrolement, Record, or Register of any such Ordinances kept in any place, the rather for soe many thousands of people are gouerned by them, beeing Law to which they can haue noe recourse, nor can consquenyly take the true measure, by which they should fashion their
<PB N="64" REF="38">
manners, to sit smoothly to the body of their Ordinance.</P>
<P>It is not the reading of them once in a yeare in parcels and cursorily, can take impression in the most learned of them (if there be any such) much lesse in the generall sort.</P>
<P>I hope that succeeding times will looke into this euill, euen in the greatest bodies incorporate, and giue it a fitting redresse.</P>
<P>And so much shall suffice for such Ordi|nances.</P>
<P><HI>I now returne to my other scattered pieces which I haue gathered together, and fasciculated into the little bundle Following.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The way how to sue forth a Writ of <HI>Supplicauit,</HI> whereby the party sued shall not be relea|sed till the partie grieued please.</HEAD>
<P>FIrst you must take your corporall Oath before a Master of the <HI>Chancerie,</HI> that you doe not desire it for any Malice, Hatred, or Enuey to the party: but for your owne quietnesse, and safety; VVhereupon you shall haue a warrant to leade your sayd <HI>Supplicauit,</HI> and thereuppon consequently the writ it selfe, so soone as the same may bee written and sealed.</P>
<P>After you haue the same granted, you may sue out of the <HI>Chancery</HI> a VVrit of <HI>Certiorare,</HI> which you should vse in this manner, (<HI>viz</HI>) VVhen you haue deliuered your <HI>Supplicauit</HI> to haue a Warrant thereuppon for the arresting of the person sued, and haue got him likewise arrested, you must keepe your <HI>Certiorare</HI> very secret and vnknowne vnto him, till he haue put in Bond or Recognizance thereupon, with Sureties (as the case requires.)</P>
<P>For if hee take notice of it, Then he will lye in Prison vntill hee haue procured a <HI>Super|sedeas</HI>
<PB N="69" REF="40">
vnto your <HI>Supplicauit;</HI> which if he doe, your <HI>Certiorare</HI> is of no force or vse. Wherefore it con|cernes you to haue care herein:</P>

<P>This hath beene a practice very frequent hereto|fore, And yet it appeareth by an especiall order made of purpose to obuiate this course, which Order I haue before recited in these collections, There was both care and prouision taken, for re|dresse and reformation, in this perticular case.</P>

<P>You shall rather in the <HI>Chancerie,</HI> then on the <HI>Kings Bench</HI> side, enter into Bond with Sureties <HI>gratis,</HI> with condition that you shall keepe the Kings peace, or bee of the good behauiour, du|ring such time as for which you shall so binde your selfe, and as the occasion shall require: For if you suspect that your Aduersarie will haue the Writ onely to binde you to the Peace, then a <HI>Su|persedeas</HI> will serue onely for the Peace; if for the good behauiour, then your <HI>Supersedeas</HI> must bee for the good behauiour; if both, for both.</P>
<P>When you haue so bound your selfe with Sure|ties; or Sureties in your absence haue so vnderta|ken (as your <HI>Manucaptors</HI>) for you before a Master of the <HI>Chancery;</HI> You may haue Warrant, And v|pon the Warrant, your Writ of <HI>Supersedeas,</HI> so soone as the same may be written and sealed.</P>

<P>The condition of your Bond in <HI>Chancery</HI> doeth not tye you to make any appearance at the deter|mination of your time limited for Peace or beha|uiour, But in the <HI>Kings bench</HI> it doth:</P>
<P>And if you doe not appeare there accordingly, your Bond is duely estreated; &amp; now more strictly prosecuted then euer heretofore:</P>
<P>Besides, if you doe appeare according to the condition of your Bond, there is then a great charge which falls vppon you of course, for the withdrawing of your Bond, which dyes in <HI>Chan|cerie;</HI> or at least, it requires no retraction there:</P>
<P>Besides, the <HI>Supersedeas</HI> is in some case more potent, beeing taken out of the <HI>Chancerie,</HI> then out of the <HI>Kings Bench:</HI> For notwithstanding the Writ to binde, bee taken out of the <HI>Chan|cerie,</HI> and beare <HI>Test</HI> before, yet the <HI>Supersedeas</HI> out of the <HI>Chancerie,</HI> is sufficient against it how|soeuer: But I make question whether the <HI>Super|sedeas</HI> of the <HI>Kings Bench,</HI> will ouer-rule the <HI>Sup|plicauit</HI> of the <HI>Chancerie</HI> bearing date before it, or no?

Therefore I doe likewise intend to set it forth as a little Cock|boat, to this greater vessell, very speedily, it beeing already finished.</P>

<HEAD>THE COMMON-PLEAS PRACTICE.</HEAD>
<P>_FIRST you are to vnderstand of what nature the Action which you would sue to bee.</P>
<P>If it be for Debt vpon a Bond, you must take a speciall care that your Originall doe agree with the Bond; For otherwise your proceeding will be er|ronious.</P>
<P>And you must make them agree thus: (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>
<P>London: <HI>Precipe Rico. Scot. nuper de London generos. (alias Dict.)</HI> As in the Bond <HI>literatim;</HI> and in the same wordes and Letters as the partie sued is stiled and titled in the Bond. <HI>Re. Thom. Smith</HI> twenty pouud, &amp;c.</P>
<P>If it be an Action of Trespasse, Or an Action v|pon the Case; Then you must style and title the Defendant whome you sue thus: (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>
<P>London: <HI>Si Thomas Smith Fec. &amp;c. Tunc pone, &amp;c. Ricard. Scot. in London generos. ostens. quare</HI>
<PB N="94" REF="53">
<HI>cum &amp;c.</HI> without any <HI>alias</HI> at all required, to be in such actions.</P>
<P>When you haue made this note of direction, for the drawing vp of your Originall and leading Writ, you must deliuer it to the <HI>Chancery</HI> man, which is the <HI>Cursitor</HI> for the Shire where you lay the action, to make this your Originall VVrit, and to get the same sealed.</P>
<P>This Originall being so made, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">aled and de|liuered vnto you, your selfe may returne, ex|cept the Defendant whom you sue bee a Free|holder of the Sheire, where you lay your action.</P>
<P>If the Defendant be a Free-holder in the Shire where the action is layd: then you must deliuer your Originall to the Sheriffe of the Shire to re|turne it.</P>
<P>If the Sheriffe do returne the Defendant suffici|ent: then soone after the sayd Returne, when the Originall is filed, the Plaintiffes Attourney must go to the Office of the <HI>Philozer</HI> of the said County, and there search and bee satisfied whe|ther any Attourney hath appeared for the De|fendant or no?</P>
<P>If the Plaintiffes Attourney doe finde that the Defendant appeareth, the Plaintiffes At|tourney (if he can) or otherwise some one Clerke of the <HI>Prothonotaries</HI> Office whom he may pro|cure, must draw vp his <HI>Declaration</HI> against the defendant, for which purpose the sayd Clerke must haue the Bond, and take out the writ into
<PB N="95" REF="53">
the <HI>Prothouotaries</HI> Remembrance, and also must know where the Plaintiffes Attourney will haue the Obligation to be layd for the <HI>Reinde.</HI></P>
<P>VVhen the declaration is deliuered to the de|fendants Attourney: the Attourney or Clerke for the Plaintiffe, is vppon demaund to shew to him the Obligation it selfe, to the end that he may examine the declaration with the same, and see and take notice of the witnesses names, who do testifie it.</P>
<P>In like manner are you to proceed in an Acti|on of debt vppon an Indenture, or debt due by Testament, or Letters of Administration, you must vppon the declaration and demaund made, shew the Indenture, the Testament, or Letters of Administration as the case is, that they may be conferred together.</P>
<P>And in an action of debt vppon an Indenture, the Originall must bee made to agree with the Indenture, as in case of an action of debt vppon Bond, in the second addition, or the <HI>alias dict. vt supra.</HI></P>
<P>The Attourney of the defendant may, when the appearance is made for his Clyent, haue Costs, and dismisse the Plaintiffe, if hee doe not declare within his time prefixed.</P>
<P>When the defendant hath appeared, and the Plaintiffe hath declared, and thereupon the defendant hath answered, or pleaded, Hee may giue to the Plaintiffe a day to Replie:
<PB N="96" REF="54">
Which if the Plaiutiffe do not accordingly, Then the Defendants Attourney may discontinue the Action of the Plaintiffe, and make him to begin anew.</P>
<P>And if the Defendant bee returned sufficient. And no Attourney appeareth for him vppon the Originall: Then the Plaintiffes Attourney must put his name to the <HI>Phillozers</HI> booke, called the <HI>Remembrance,</HI> where the <HI>Originall</HI> shall bee ta|ken out: And marke the same <HI>Remembrance,</HI> when his next Processe which is a <HI>Pone</HI> shall bee returnable.</P>
<P>This next Processe hee must seale and deliuer to the Sheriffe.</P>
<P>And if at the day of the Returne thereof, no At|tourney do yet appeare for the Defendant: Then the Plaintiffes Attourney must in like manner marke the Remembrance, and take out another Writ against him called a <HI>Distresse,</HI> and so the Plaintiffe may sue out <HI>Distresse</HI> after <HI>Distresse,</HI> vn|till such time as the Defendant doth appeare.</P>
<P>And if the Sheriffe shall returne such small issues for fauour, as whereby the Defendant is encouraged to stand out, and will not appeare: Then the Plaintiffes Attourney himselfe may moue the Court for increase of <HI>issues,</HI> or else A|merce the Sheriffe.</P>

<P>But if it be at the <HI>Common-pleas</HI> Barre, He may not craue a <HI>Tales de Circumstantibus,</HI> but a <HI>Tales</HI> onely, or sue a <HI>Distresse</HI> with a <HI>Tales.</HI></P>
<P>The first onely is a <HI>Decem Tales</HI> at the Barre: The second, an <HI>Octo Tales,</HI> if the <HI>Decem</HI> did not fill; Soe from <HI>Octo,</HI> vnto <HI>Quinto:</HI> and from <HI>Quin|to</HI> to <HI>Duo Tales,</HI> hee must discend till the Iury be filled, all which the said processe must bee taken out of the <HI>Prothonotaries</HI> Office, or the Office of the Clerke of the Iuries, which bee respectiuelie entered most duely.</P>
<P>And if the Sheriffe vppon any of these sayd VVrits doe returne <HI>Tard&egrave;,</HI> for want of sufficient time to warne the Iury, You are to sue forth an <HI>Al. distress.</HI></P>
<P>Note, that if a <HI>Plea</HI> bee pleaded heere by the Defendant, and the Plaintiffe haue therevppon replyed: if if it bee a plea of a former Terme, the defendant can neuer amend or with-draw his plea, except it bee in Letters or Syllables, But if it be in the same Terme he may.</P>
<P>For in this Court euery plea is, or ought to
<PB N="104" REF="58">
be entred in euery Terme as it is pleaded; how|soeuer it is otherwise in the <HI>Kings Bench.</HI></P>
<P>If the Defendant be returned <HI>sufficent</HI> in an action of Trespasse, A <HI>Distresse</HI> is to be awarded.</P>
<P>And if hee be returned <HI>Nihil:</HI> then the seuerall <HI>Cap:</HI> and an exigent be awarded.</P>
<P>If an <HI>Vltary</HI> bee returned, then lyeth a <HI>Capias vtlagant,</HI> generall, which is for the body onely.</P>
<P>Or else a <HI>Cap. vtlagat.</HI> speciall; which is for the body and goods.</P>
<P>Note, that if you doe sue any of the Nobili|tie of this Land, who are of the Parliament House, in any action whatsoeuer, wherein Pro|cesse of <HI>Vtlary</HI> lyeth; Although the Sheriffe re|turne him <HI>Nihil habet,</HI> yet you may not sue a <HI>Capias</HI> against him, but a <HI>Pone,</HI> into the Shiere where his Land lyeth: wherevppon if he do not appeare, hee looseth fiue pounds. And after a <HI>Pone,</HI> you shall sue a <HI>Distresse,</HI> and <HI>Distresse</HI> after <HI>Distresse, in infinitum,</HI> vntill he doth appeare.</P>
<P>If after the Sheriffe haue taken the Defendant vpon a <HI>Cap. ad satisfaciend.</HI> for the Plaintiffe, He suffer him to depart vpon Sureties, or pawne, and commit him not to safe keeping, It shall bee said an escape against the Sheriffe.</P>
<P>And then the Plaintiffe may at his election choose whether hee will call for the Returne of the VVrit, or sue the Sheriffe for the Escape, and recouer his Debt and Charges against him: O therwise hee may haue his <HI>Capias</HI> and <HI>Exigent,</HI>
<PB N="105" REF="58">
and vpon Returne thereof vtlaw the Defendant vpon the Iudgment.</P>
<P>After this kinde of <HI>Vtlary,</HI> the Defendant shall neuer haue his pardon, except he first agree with the Plaintiffe, and satisfie him.</P>
<P>Also the Plaintiffe may at his election haue a VVrit of <HI>Elegit</HI> in this case, to extend vpon halfe the Lands and goods of the Defendant: except Cattle and Oxen for his plough &amp;c.</P>
<P>But it behooueth the Plaintiffe to take good heede how he sueth forth the said VVrit of <HI>Eligit:</HI> For if it be once entered, you shall neuer haue any other Execution.</P>
<P>Also after a iudgment, the Plaintiffe may haue an Execution of <HI>Fieri facias de bonis &amp; ca|tallis,</HI> and thereby leauey his whole summe that is giuen, with the Costs, or some part thereof, according to the value of the goods of the De|fendants which he can finde.</P>
<P>And if at the first he bee not satisfied of his whole summe, hee may sue forth another <HI>Fieri fac.</HI> and so one after another, till he bee fully sa|tisfied of his whole Debt.</P>
<P>Your Processe being in a VVrit of <HI>Rescous,</HI> and <HI>Rauishment of a Ward,</HI> as in Trespasse you shall hold like proceedings of <HI>Attach.</HI> and <HI>Distresse,</HI> and for want of <HI>Distresse,</HI> three <HI>Capias</HI> and an <HI>Exigent.</HI></P>
<P>The like in a <HI>Quare eiecit infra terminu~, &amp; E|iectione firme,</HI> and this was giuen by a late statute</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="59">And the like by the same Statute, in a Writ of <HI>Annuitie</HI> and Couenant vppon an Inden|ture.</P>
<P>But in a Writ of <HI>Entry,</HI> the like proceeding is not, for the Processe is <HI>Grand Cape,</HI> and <HI>Petit Cape.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Grand Cape</HI> lieth, when any of those VVrits are deliuered to the Sheriff to summo~ the Lands, and, if at the returne of the same, the Defendant appeareth not, but maketh default, then the <HI>Pro|thonotaries</HI> Clerke is to giue a day to the tenant to come in, or else a <HI>Grand Cape</HI> shal be awarded of the Land, whereuppon he shall be in the cour|tesie of the Court, whether they will grant him a <HI>Supersedeas</HI> for the discharge of the same, or no. Otherwise hee is to wage his Law, and depose that hee was not lawfully summoned, which if he doe, and it bee afterwards proued that hee was lawfully summoned; then he is in danger of periury.</P>
<P>If the Tenant or Defendant doe not appeare vpon the <HI>Grand Cape,</HI> then a <HI>Petit Cape</HI> is to goe forth, and a day likewise to bee farther giuen, and vppon default of appearance, then the Lands in question are recouered, and there|vppon the <HI>Cape</HI> is directed to the Sheriffe to seize the Lands into the Kings hands, vntill farther Proces, &amp;c.</P>

<P>For if hee haue before that time cast his <HI>Essyone,</HI> then may he vpon day giuen, call the Demandant <HI>non-suite,</HI> and cause him to begin againe.</P>
<P>Therefore the Demandants Attourney in this case must especially inuigilate the Office of <HI>Es|soynes,</HI> and in <HI>Reall</HI> actions to get his VVrit fylled, and to enter a <HI>Recipitur,</HI> as in a VVrit of <HI>Dower.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Warrentia charta, De droyte, &amp; Surdisseisin,</HI> haue the like proceeding, because their Processe is also alike.</P>
<P>If you haue Iudgment in any action, and suffer the Iudgment to continue without doing of any thing therein, by the space of a yeare and a day, you shall then be forced by reason of such delay, before you may take out any execution thereuppon, to sue out of the Court where your said iudgment is Recorded, a writ of <HI>Scire fa|cias,</HI> and after the Returne thereof you are to giue a day to the Defendant to come into the Court, and to shew cause why the Iudgment should not be awarded against him vpon his de|fault; wherevppon if good cause be not shewed, the Iudgment is to bee allowed, and execution may be taken forth.</P>

<HEAD><HI>How to sue a matter of</HI> Errour.</HEAD>
<P>IF you would sue a matter of <HI>Errour,</HI> you must either make a perfect true Copy of the Originall, or of the <HI>Exigent</HI> in that cause, and carry it to the <HI>Cursitor</HI> of the Shiere, where the Action lyeth, thereby to make yovr VVrit of <HI>Errour.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="61">VVhen you haue your Writ of <HI>Errour</HI> (if it be before Iudgment) you may deliuer it to the Clerke of the Treasurie, wherevppon the Attourney for the Plaintiffe is to deliuer vnto you the number of the Roles where euery thing is entered.</P>
<P>And if it bee after Iudgment, Then before you know the number of the Roles, you must shew cause of <HI>Errour</HI> to the Court; or else your Writ will not be allowed.</P>
<P>And in case that when the Writ bee alow|ed, the Plaintiffes Attourney must deliuer the number of the Roles; o the Clerke of the Trea|sury: who will deliuer the VVrit ouer with the Record.</P>
<P>And then if the Defendants Attourney doe not get his Record to bee certified the same Terme, the Plaintiffes Attourney may procure a day to bee giuen in Court vnto him to do it, and to remooue the same.</P>
<P>By which day if the Defendant doth it not accordingly, then hath hee lost the benifit of the <HI>Errour.</HI> And after one VVrit of <HI>Errour</HI> so put by; the Defendant shall neuer haue any more.</P>
<P>And if the Record bee accordingly certifi|ed, then the next Terme following you are to assigne the <HI>Errours</HI> there.</P>
<P>Otherwise there will goe forth two VVrits of <HI>Scire fac.</HI> to be deliuered to the Sheriffe of <HI>Midd.</HI> and to giue you warning to assigne the <HI>Errours,</HI>
<PB N="110" REF="62">
which if you doe not within three or foure dayes after the Returne of the latter of the sayd two Writs, the Writ of <HI>Errour</HI> will bee quasht, and you shall lose the benefit thereof.</P>
<P>And if one be vtlawed vpon meane Processe, and would reuerse the same by writ of <HI>Errour,</HI> hee must take this course: (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>Looke if there be any Writ vnreturned,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Or any VVrit mis-returned:</ITEM>
<ITEM>Or any VVrit vnfyled:</ITEM>
<ITEM>Whether the <HI>Proclamation</HI> bee fyled, or no?</ITEM>
<ITEM>And whether it bee well returned:</ITEM>
<ITEM>Or whether a Warrant of Attourney be put in or no?</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>All these before mentioned be <HI>Errours,</HI> which before Iudgement the Court will correct them|selues.</P>
<P>And if you finde any of the said <HI>Errours,</HI> you must goe to the Clerke, and shewe him the num|ber Role where the <HI>Exigent</HI> is entred, and cause him to enter the <HI>Vtlary.</HI></P>
<P>This being done, you are then to get the Bun|dles where any such writ is fyled, to bee brought into the Court, from the Office of <HI>Custos breui|um,</HI> where they be kept.</P>
<P>Then you must haue one to enforme the Court therefore on your behalfe.</P>
<P>If the Errour which you pretend bee for want of a Proclamation, then you are to get aswell the
<PB N="111" REF="62">
Record of the Terme where the <HI>Exigent</HI> is entred, as the bundle of VVrits to bee brought into the Court to be reviewed.</P>
<P>And the like you are to do of the meane Pro|cesse.</P>
<P>And if it shall appeare to the Court, That any of the Processe bee fyled and not returned, Or there be error in the Returne, Or there bee want of meane Processe, or Proclamation; the Court will award the the <HI>Reuerser</HI> to bee entred.</P>
<P>And if the party vtlawed can finde no Error, and yet would vndoe the vtlarie, if it bee vtlary before a Iudgement; He is to sue out his writ of Errour, and therevpon a <HI>Supersedeas:</HI></P>
<P>Then hee must sue out his pardon of Course, and vppon that, Hee may haue a <HI>Scire facias</HI> di|rected to the Sheriffe of the County where the Originall was laid, to giue warning to the plain|tife to bee ready in Court to prosecute his action against the Defendant, if hee haue any thing to charge him withall.</P>
<P>Hereupon, if the plaintiffe doe not declare a|gainst him the Defendant within a certaine space giuen to him by the Court, Then the Defen|dant shall bee quit of that action; and the plain|tiffe is to beginne his suite againe if hee will.</P>
<P>But if the partie vtlawed haue any goods or Cattle taken by colour of that Vtlary, Then hee is to sue out a writ <HI>de non molestand.</HI> from the Clerke of the Treasury, which writ hee is to de|liuer
<PB N="112" REF="63">
to the Sheriffe; VVhereuppon the Sheriffe is to deliuer to him his goods or Cattell againe without Bond.</P>
<P>But it is otherwise where the Defendant doth not bring his Writ <HI>de non molestand.</HI> but intends to ouerthrow all by Errour, for in that case, hee shall bee driuen to enter into Bond for the proouing of the Errour.</P>
<P>In euery case where the cause goeth with the Plaintiffe vpon a <HI>Demurrer,</HI> and the Debt or matter recouered is not expressed, the Iudges of the Court may giue their finall Iudgment, and grant you a Writ to enquire of dammages; which writ shall bee directed and deliuered to the Sheriffe, who by vertue thereof, is to impan|nell a Iurie, who after they be sworne, vpon E|uidence to be produced on the Plaintiffes part, may giue in dammages so much as they thinke in their consciences, and as the VVitnesses shall prooue vpon their Oath that he hath sustained.</P>
<P>Also in an Action of waste you are to pro|ceede in like sort, if you certefie the Iudges how the Defendant hath made the place waste, and you doe it before Iudgment is by them giuen.</P>
<P>But the Iury needeth not to haue such great care of the dammages in waste committed, as in other cases of enquirie in that kind: For what|soeuer the Iurie giues in dammages therein, the Court will, according to the Statute in that case especially prouided, double the same dammages.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="63">The Plaintiffes Attourney must be carefull to looke to the Clerke of the Essoynes, and take heede where the Essoynes do lye, and whether they be lawfully cast, or no.</P>

<P>And the Attourney for the Defendant should also be as watchfull ouer the Casting of the Es|soynes; For that oftentimes it proues to bee a benefit to himselfe, and a commodity to his Clyent.</P>
<P>Euery Essoyne must bee adiourned in time, with such sufficient continuance as the nature of the Action requireth.</P>
<P>For want of Adiournement of the Essoyne, there lyeth a <HI>Non-suite.</HI></P>
<P>The casting of an Essoyne where it will not lye, may be disalowed, quashed, and turned in|to a default&punc; But when it is rightly cast, then it is allowed, and then it is to be adiourned.</P>
<P>And you must farther take heede, where the inferiour Tenant may pray in ayde of the Supe|riour Lord, and when, and in what case a Vow|cher lyeth to recouer by force.</P>

<P>If the Defendants Attourney will suffer the Action to go against his Clyent by a <HI>Nihil dicit,</HI> He must take heede that there bee no part of the debt payd: For if hee do, his Clyent is in his Aduersaries courtesie for the whole debt, wherein the danger is the more if it be vpon a Bond; For then he is lyable to the penalty and all.</P>

<P>IN a <HI>Recouery</HI> in a Writ of <HI>Entry</HI> in the <HI>Post,</HI> the Attourney who sueth it forth, must take good aduice in the drawing of his VVrit of <HI>Entry,</HI> he is to carry it to the <HI>Chancery</HI> man to make it.</P>
<P>And the Attourney must take with him, either his Clyent, or some other person who knoweth the Land, and get him sworne before one of the Masters of the <HI>Chancery</HI> for the true value of the Land, and what it is worth by the yeare.</P>
<P>Thenmust the value be set down on the back|side of the VVrit, and the name of the Master of the <HI>Chancery,</HI> who tooke the Oath thereunto.</P>
<P>Next, this Attourney must carry it to the Kings Attourneys Clerke, who is appoynted for the same purpose to get his Masters hand vnto it.</P>
<P>But before you haue your VVrit againe from hence, your Clyent, or some other for him, must enter into a Recognizance to the King in such manner, as Master Attourney Generall his Clerke shall draw vp and make for you, And the said Clerke is to carry your Clyant, or other partie, who is so to enter into Recognizance to the Court of <HI>Common-pleas,</HI> to acknowledge the same before the Iudges there.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="68">The effect and condition of the said Recog|nizance is, that those Lands specified in the VVrit, are not holden io <HI>Capite,</HI> and that the Recouery is not hurtfull to his Maiesty, nor his successors.</P>
<P>And if the Lands bee holden in <HI>Capite,</HI> you must take course before you sue out your VVrit of <HI>Entry</HI> for, license in that behalfe; otherwise you shall runne into a great inconuenience, and be forced afterwards to sue out your Pardon in this behalfe.</P>
<P>After your writ of <HI>Entry</HI> is passed through the Kings Attournies hand, then if the Te|nants of the Land will appeare in proper person, Your VVrit of <HI>Enrty</HI> with the Returne thereof, must be taken out into one of the <HI>Prothonotaries</HI> Remembrances, where you will haue your Recouery entred.</P>
<P>And then in the Margent of the Remem|brance make the appearance of him who is vouched.</P>
<P>And this being done, deliuer your writ to one Sergeant, and the Remembrance to another, when the Court is at good and fitting leasure.</P>
<P>Note withall, that if this bee done with a <HI>single Vowcher,</HI> you are to retaine three Ser|geants; and if it bee to bee done with a <HI>Double Vowcher&punc;</HI> you are to retayne fiue Sergeants.</P>
<P>And when it is acknowledged, then you are to giue the VVrit of <HI>Entry</HI> to the Cerke of the

<P>And it behooueth the attourney for the De|mandant to bee circumspect, both for the Re|turne of the VVrit of <HI>Entry</HI> and <HI>Seisin,</HI> and for the filling of them, as also for the Warrants of attourney on both sides, For otherwise by default or omission in any of them, the Recouery may bee ouerthrowne againe.</P>

<HEAD>THE KINGS BENCH.</HEAD>
<P>_THE <HI>Kings Bench</HI> consistes of the <HI>Prothonotary</HI> side, and the Crowne Office side, &amp;c. On the <HI>Prothonotaries</HI> side are (as I deliuered in my <HI>Search</HI> of Record:)</P>
<P><HI>Onely Personall Actions, and some mixt Actions? besides such matters as the King is partie.</HI></P>
<P>FOR their proceeding in personall and mixt Actions, It is generally the like as that of the <HI>Common-pleas,</HI> and therefore shall not require a second recitall. So are their Fees
<PB N="166" REF="90">
generally alike: For he that is a sufficient <HI>Com|mon-pleas</HI> man, is able to the practice of any other Court of Common Law whatsoeuer.</P>
<P>And therefore I shall onely shew you in what poynts of proceeding they doe differ, and how easily those differences are, or may bee reconciled withall.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kings Bench</HI> vseth onely a <HI>Latitat</HI> for their leading processe.</P>
<P>To this, the first Leading <HI>Capias</HI> of the <HI>Common-pleas</HI> does answere.</P>
<P>For as the <HI>Capias</HI> hath an Originall Writ to goe before it? So the <HI>Latitat</HI> supposeth and pre|tendeth a Bill of <HI>Middlesex</HI> to lead it also, For that is granted in the <HI>Kings Bench,</HI> because it is intended that the Defendant vpon returne of a Bill of <HI>Middlesex</HI> precedent doth <HI>Latitare in ualliua tua, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Onely the <HI>Latitat</HI> is like to Doctor <HI>Giffords</HI> wa|ter, which serues for all diseases, and so it holds one forme in all cases and Actions whatsoeuer, and charges the defendant onely <HI>De pl. Trans,</HI> bee it for debt or other cause, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But the Originall must containe the true cause of action, and be so exactly set downe and drawn, that all the following Processe and proceeding, may be tyed to agree with it <HI>punctuatim.</HI></P>

<HI>Ostensum est</HI> in the other, though there bee some difference in the first rise, and here and there after|wards in the proceeding of the Remooue, put|ting in Bayle, and filing of it, yet if wee conferre their Bills of Costs together: in the conclusion we shall finde a very little difference in the whole.</P>
<P>Both pay dammage cleere, that is, poundage vpon euery twenty shillings in a Iudgment: But the <HI>Kings Bench</HI> payes onely twelue pence in the pound, and the other payeth two shillings.</P>
<P>There bee some other few differences in the formalitie, but none in the substance of their my|steries. And thus I leaue the <HI>Prothonotary</HI> side.</P>
<P>For the Crowne Office side: It pleased some to make an especiall suite to exclude my pen from meddling in their mysterie in my former Worke. And therefore (as I then sayd) so I must now resolue, that I doe aduisedly pretermit it, and giue it backe to their owne care, who are bet|ter able to performe this generall good at their pleasure, when it shall please them to intend the publique. And now I bend my iourney home|ward, and to my natiue Birth-bed: London.</P>

<P>THey doe all deale in Actions personall for the most part, vnlesse on the Lord Mayors side sometimes a Reall Action falls in by chance, for matter or demand of something lying within the Citie.</P>
<P>Their proceeding generally is <HI>ad exemplum</HI> of the <HI>Kings Bench,</HI> onely differing in such cases, as where their Customes carry their predomina|tion.</P>
<P>The Defendant, if he bee a Free-man, hath foure defaults, (that is) foure the next Court dayes of the place where the action lyeth, to put

in Bayle to the cause: But the Forteyner hath no such priuiledge.</P>
<P>The Plaintiffe hath a day ouer to declare, vn|lesse it bee so that the Defendant is a Prisoner ly|ing in Durance vppon the same suite; For in such case the Plaintiffe must declare vppon the very next Court day following the Arrest.</P>
<P>And the Defendant is brought by Writ out of the prison to the Barre, to pleade vnto the said Declaration.</P>
<P>There is one mayne difference betweene the Proceeding here, and that aboue at <HI>VVestminster,</HI> which is in the most familiar and ordinary acti|on of the Citie, (<HI>viz.</HI>) their <HI>Indebitatus assumpsit,</HI> And that is, that they deny wager of Law here, vppon it: which (howsoeuer it bee countenanced, and glossed by the Custome) I am sure it takes a|way the Inheritance of a free-borne Subiect by the Law.</P>

<HEAD>The forme of proceeding <HI>Ore tenus</HI> in the <HI>Starre-Cham|ber</HI> followeth.</HEAD>
<P>IF the Delinquent hath done or spoken any thing worthy the Hearing and Censure of this honourable Court, And be questioned for the same, And therevpon doth confesse the fact or words, and subscribeth his hand to the same Confession made in writing before the Lord <HI>Chancellour</HI> or Lord <HI>Keeper,</HI> or any the Lords, Iudges, or the Kings Counsaile; And doth, when he is called to this Barre to answere it, likewise confesse the same to be true, and ac|knowledgeth his hand subscribed to the confes|sion made (as aforesaid:) Then, and in such case the Court vseth to proceede to Sentence and Censure in the matter.</P>
<P>It hath not bin seene formerly, That any but the Lord <HI>Chancellor</HI> or Lord <HI>Keeper,</HI> the Iudges, or the Kings Counsaile haue taken any such Ex|aminations or Confessions so subscribed vnder the Delinquents hand (as aforesaid.)</P>
<P>Neuerthelesse, if any other who hath authori|tie in this behalfe, shall take any such Examina|tion &amp; subscription, And the partie so examined and subscribing, shall at the Barre confesse the
<PB N="189" REF="102">
matter, and acknowledge the hand; The Court may proceede to Sentence and Censure there|vpon:</P>
<P>For the life of his Examination is the Confes|sion and acknowledgement thereof at the Barre, when the Court doth examine him (as the cu|stome is) whether that which is confessed in writing be true, or not.</P>
<P>And if the Lord <HI>Chancellor</HI> or Lord <HI>Keeper,</HI> the Iudges, the Kings Counsaile, or any other shall take any such Examination and Confession; Yet, if the partie at the Barre shall either deny his hand thereunto subscribed, or the matter therein contained, to be true; Then the Court doth not vse to proceede to sentence or censure him.</P>
<P>So consequently the strength of the Exami|nation seemeth not to stand in the partie who taketh it, if hee be of authoritie, but in the parties Re-examining the same at the Barre, and the Recognization thereof.</P>
<P>And so I conclude the practice of the Court of <HI>Starre-Chamber.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE EXCHE|QVER.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Exchequer</HI> hath three seuerall pla|ces of proceeding, according to the three differing maner of busines belong|ing vnto it on the pleading side: (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>The <HI>Chequer</HI> Barre,</ITEM>
<ITEM>The <HI>Chequer</HI> Chamber,</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Court of <HI>Pleas.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>For the <HI>Exchequer</HI> Chamber, It is the English Court or place where the proceedings are held by English Bill and Answere; And the procee|ding thereof is very much like to that of the <HI>Chancerie,</HI> (as is said before) and therefore I meane not to insist any further vpon it.</P>
<P>For the Court of <HI>Pleas,</HI> It is the very Imi|tatiue of the Courts of Common Law in the Hall, and therefore I would bee loth to boyle the same meate twice ouer to your Trencher:
<PB N="191" REF="103">
but reserue my selfe for the <HI>Chequer</HI> Barre espe|cially, and the Receipt side.</P>
<P>The Processe and Proceedings of the <HI>Che|quer</HI> Barre are distributed betweene the two <HI>Re|membrancers</HI> of this Court; (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Kings <HI>Re|membrancer</HI> and the Lord <HI>Treasurers Remem|brancer:</HI></P>
<P>And what doth properly appertaine to the one, and what to the other, I haue at large set downe in my <HI>Direction</HI> for <HI>Search of Record,</HI> ac|cording to the finall Doome and Order of Sir <HI>Richard Lyster</HI> Lord chiefe Baron in the time of King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth:</P>
<P>And by the view of the particular matters and businesses therein appropriated so respectiuely, you may the better iudge of the proceeding to be held vpon them; the rather, for that euen here at the Barre side, they doe in most things follow the practice of the common Law also.</P>
<P>Therefore I shall bend my selfe to set foorth the practice of those things which are not presi|dented in the other Common Lawe Courts at all, beeing matters onely proper to this, &amp;c. with that small difference which is betweene this Court and those of the Common Lawe be|lowe Staires, in point of Appearance at the be|ginning of a Suite, &amp;c.</P>

<P>This Bayle must bee alwayes taken before a Baron in the Court, and not in his Chamber, as is vsed in other Courts:</P>

<HEAD>FEES BELONGING TO THE CLERKE of the PEACE and his Office, <HI>now follow.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FIrst, it is to be vnderstood, that heretofore the <HI>Clerke</HI> of the <HI>Peace,</HI> being onely Clerke vnder and vnto the <HI>Custos Rotulorum</HI> of the County, was wont to haue wages yeerely of the said <HI>Custos</HI> for his seruice.</P>
<P>The Clerke of the <HI>Peace</HI> is to make out all the Writs of warning, of all such persons as are to giue attendance at the Sessions of the Peace, to be kept at such place, as the Iustices doe ap|point and agree vpon.</P>
<P>And at the place and time appointed for the Sessions, The Clerke doth first reade the Com|mission of the Iustices, And then the Sheriffe of the Shire doth returne foure and twenty of euery hundred in the County, of which there
<PB N="202" REF="109">
is one Grand Iury for the body of the Shire drawne forth; and this is called the great En|quest.</P>
<P>And when the great Enquest is sworne, One of the Iustices giueth the charge vnto them, wherevpon they shall enquire.</P>
<P>After the charge giuen and ended, They doe depart from the Barre, to some roome in some house neere thereabouts, where they may bee conueniently together.</P>
<P>And to them then and there are brought all Bills of Felony, Trepasse, Ryots, or other misdemeanours &amp; offences giuen them in charge to enquire of.</P>
<P>And if the great Enquest finde any of the said Bils or presentments to bee true, And the parties themselues who are therein found faulty, or guilty, be absent, so that they cannot be quit|ted, or punished for the present: Then, &amp; in such case, The Clerke of the Peace is to make forth against them three <HI>Capias's<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> and an Exigent to come in, to trauerse the presentment, or to sub|iect themselues to the Censure and Doome of the Court, &amp;c.</P>
<P>When the great Enquest finde the Bill true; they write on the Back-side thereof, <HI>Billa vera;</HI> But in case they can not finde it true for want of sufficient Euidence; Then they write on the back-side thereof, <HI>Ignoramus.</HI></P>
<P>If it bee found, then the Clerke is to make

forth Processe (as aforesaid:) but if the Iury finde it not, then farther proceeding is not to be had therevpon.</P>
<P>If the partie so indicted be present, if it bee in case of Felony, &amp;c. hee may bee forthwith arraigned before the said Iustices, who are to proceed vpon him farther, as the Law in such case prouideth.</P>
<P>If he be not present, nor Attached, but at li|bertie till hee be vtlawed; Then after such <HI>Vt|lary,</HI> euery Accessarie to the fellony, may bee arraigned and tryed; but not before.</P>
<P>For other offences of inferiour nature, the partie indicted is to come in to make his Fine at the discretion of the Iustices, or two of them at the least, whereof one must bee of the <HI>Quorum,</HI> vnlesse that before that time the partie can get the Indictment to be remoo|ued by <HI>Certiorare</HI> into the <HI>Kings Bench.</HI></P>

<P>And for the Licence and Bond of Victualers giuen vpon Licence,</P>
<P>The Fees are vncertaine: For in some Counties the whole charges stands the Victualler in 6. s. in some 7. s. and in some 8. s. <HI>Vijs &amp; modis per annum</HI> yeerely.

<P>When you haue a promise there, you must pre|ferre your Petition to him that is Master, desi|ring that he will be pleased to grant you a Com|mission for the finding of the same Lunaticke: which Commission is to be directed to the Feo|darie of the County where the Lunaticke abi|deth, and two others at the least, whom it shall please the said Master to appoint.</P>
<P>When you haue order for the Commission (as aforesaid) Then you are to goe to his Maie|sties

<P>When the said Commission is executed, and the Office found there vpon, The same must be deliuered into the Court of Wards, And hee that deliuereth it, must bee sworne vpon the deliuerie, that hee receiued it from the Com|missioners, and that in such manner as he doth deliuer it, being vnaltered in any point.</P>

<P>Then it is to be deliuered into the Office at the <HI>Temple,</HI> from whence it is to be sent ouer to the <HI>Petty bagge,</HI> where the Clerke will make

you out a Copie of the same Commission, and Inquisition found vpon it, which you must car|ry backe to the Office of the Court of Wards, And then the chiefe Officer there, or the Audi|tor of the Court will make your Schedule by, and out of the same Office or Inquisition so found.</P>
<P>To this Schedule you are to get the hand of the Master of the Court; And that being ob|tained, you are to bring the said Schedule so signed to the Officer, who is to make your In|dentures of bargaine therevpon, which he, vpon sight thereof, will performe accordingly.</P>
<P>Then you are to carry the said indentures to the Master of the Court, who will set his hand to one part of the same, and you that haue the Grant of the said Lunaticke, must set your hand and seale to the other part. And the part which you are to haue, must bee heerevpon sealed with the seale of the Court.</P>
<P>But before you haue your part, you must seale to the Kings part, And must also finde two Sureties to be bound with you, That you shall truely account once in euery yeere to the Au|ditor of the Court for the profits of the liuing of the said Lunaticke, And to answere the stocke and state of the said Lunaticke, if hee shall chance to dye, or recouer his former health.</P>

Commission directed to foure such in the Coun|trey as you will nominate, to see and certifie the signing and sealing of your said Sureties to the said Bond.</P>
<P>This Commission and Bond must bee retur|ned into the Court of Wards, who deliuers it ouer to the proper Clerke or Officer; where|vpon you shall haue your part vnder the hand of the Master of the Court, and the Seale of the said Court.</P>
<P>Then must you Inroll your part of the said Indenture, so signed and sealed in the Auditors Office: And so you haue made an end, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>Instructions to passe a Ward.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IN primis,</HI> you must make meanes for the ob|taining of a Ward, as in case of a Lunaticke aforesaid.</P>
<P>When you haue got the promise and order for it from the Master of the Court of Wards, you are to goe to the Kings Attourney of the said Court, and vse means vnto him for a Com|mission to enquire and finde the Ward, and a Tenure for the King; whereupon you may haue a Warrant from him to leade such a Co~mission.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="114">When you haue that Warrant, and therevpon your Commission; you must get that Commis|sion, to be by the proper Clerke to whom it doth appertaine, directed to the Feodarie of the County, and two such others as you shall no|minate and appoint.</P>
<P>When this Commission is sped and executed, and the Tenure found for the King, which doth consequently proue the Ward, you are to re|turne this Commission into the <HI>Petty-bagge,</HI> and there to take a Copie of it, which you are to deliuer to the Clerke to whom it belongs in the Office of the Court of Wards; and here|vpon he will make you forth vpon sight thereof a Schedule of the value of the Land.</P>
<P>Then you must carry that Schedule to the Secretarie of the Master of the Court, to the end that he may procure his Masters hand to be set vnto the same, And the Office for it, with the Wards exhibition, and the names of the partie, or parties, which are to haue the Ward: All which must be likewise set downe.</P>
<P>And when you haue the said Schedule so sig|ned, Therevpon the Indentures of the grant are to be drawne vp, To the one part whereof, he or they that haue the Ward, are to Seale and signe; and to the other, the Master of the Court doth vse to subscribe his hand, and then the Seale of the Court is affixed therevnto.</P>
<P>Now if the parties who haue the graunt,
<PB N="214" REF="115">
haue not also their Sureties who are to vnder|take for them in this behalfe, in Towne, so that they may heere enter into Bond with him, with condition of making a true account, and not doing of any waste, &amp;c. Then there must bee a Commission procured to foure such persons as the Grantee or Grantees shall name, to attend and see the sealing and deliuery made by him, or them, and his, or their Sureties, which the Commissioners must certifie and send vp vnder their hands and seales, attested with some Wit|nesses to the same.</P>
<P>And this must be deliuered into the Office of the said Court, to the proper Officer, with and vpon Oath to bee made, that it is deliuered in such manner as it was receiued from the Com|missioners themselues vnaltered, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Therevpon you shall haue a Bill for the re|ceiuing of the exhibition thereof, And accor|ding to the Ancient forme of practice, That Bill was wont to bee then signed by the Kings hand, by the procurement of the proper Clerke of the Office.</P>
<P>And when the same is so signed, it does passe through the seuerall Seales, and at the last vnder the Great Seale of <HI>England,</HI> which course, I vn|derstand not to be altered as yet: howsoeuer I may suspect, in regard of the many new Instru|ctions which haue issued of late times, for the ordering of the affaires of this Court, that

<P>When your said Patent is so sealed, you are to deliuer the same and the Schedule of the value of the Land to the Auditor of the Court, who is to see that the same bee forthwith en|rolled.</P>
<P>And therevpon the Auditor will giue or|der to the Feodarie of the Shire, to pay you the exhibition yeerely, &amp;c.</P>
