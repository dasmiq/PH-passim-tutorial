<HEAD>To all the Pious and Sober amongst them that deny, or doubt of In|fant Baptism.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Brethren-in our Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE matters in difference betwixt you and us, are not so great, as the angry and uncharitable on ei|ther side wou'd make 'em seem; there may be some (we doubt not) both with us and you, that do Hereticate and Damn each other on the Account of their disagreeing Judgments about <HI>Baptism</HI>: (Nor is it to be wonder'd at&punc; if those who are strangers to all serious Re|ligion, should put the respective differing Opinions in the place and stead of it:) But we were willing here to let the World see, there are with us, and (we Charitably hope) with you also, those that are both of a sounder Judgment and of a much better Spirit.</P>
<P>We are perswaded, there are many amongst you, who (tho you do dissent from us in some lesser matters, yet) are agreed with us in the most important and concerning things. Wherever there are real Christians on both sides, in any Controversie, (as we make no question but there are in this) it is most certain, the things wherein they are a|greed, are greater, far greater, than any wherein they can differ. When all the great substantials of Christianity are out of doubt, both with you and us, that which shall af|terwards remain as a disagreed, or doub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed thing on ei|ther side, must needs be Comparatively very small, and not worthy of the Heat and Zeal too commonly laid out upon it.</P>
<P>And we must profess for our own parts, (tho wherein we differ from you, we are verily perswaded, the truth is
<PB REF="4">
on our side, yet reckoning it to be only truth of an infe|rior Nature) it has not been without regret, that we have been engag'd in this Contention. The <HI>Disputation</HI> it self was not what we sought, or was forward to; it was not we that gave the Challenge: Nor when given, would we have accepted it, had it not been so circumstanc'd, as that our refusal wou'd most probably have redounded to the detriment and dishonour of what we believe to be the Truth: Many, especially the more injudicious part of the Auditory, before whom the Challenge was given, not be|ing likely to judge otherwise, than that what we main|tain wou'd not bear a publick hearing, shou'd we have declin'd a <HI>Disputation,</HI> which we were so publickly pro|vok'd to.</P>
<P>And for this <HI>Publication</HI> of it, 'tis what we are alike passive in: The World shou'd have had no after-trouble about that <HI>Disputation,</HI> might we have been the choosers: But since your Dr. <HI>Russel</HI> has abus'd the World with a most false and unfair Account of that matter; we are ne|cessitated in our own defence, as well as that of the Truth, to Publish the ensuing Papers. We wou'd not therefore, that either what was said by us at the <HI>Disputa|tion,</HI> or is further added in these our <HI>Reflections</HI> shou'd be misunderstood by you: This is not work that we take pleasure in, but what we have been constrain'd to: And if any Reflections shou'd occur that may seem too severe; we wou'd here declare, they proceed not from displea|sure against the whole Body of those whose sentiments agree with yours, nor against any one barely for that reason: But we cou'd not but manifest a just indignation against the Egregious falsehood and uncharitableness of him that publish'd the late (pretended) <HI>Narrative</HI>: And we desire, that no one of the Pious and Sober amongst you, wou'd apply to your selves, what was only intend|ed as a Rebuke to him, or those who are too like him. Nor will the rest of you (we hope) take it ill from us, that we expose, as it deserves, that which is so base, tho' it be found with a Person that pretends, in the present Controversie, to fall in with you. You will not, you cannot once imagine, that his Concurrence with you in this Point of Baptism, will hallow or excuse all that <HI>de|ceit</HI> and <HI>falsehood</HI> that appears in him: Nor can you your
<PB REF="4">
selves like it, that he shou'd endeavour to support your cause with lies.</P>
<P>This being premis'd, we are in hopes, the following Papers, if they shou'd do no <HI>good</HI> amongst you, may at least be look'd into without doing <HI>hurt.</HI> So far as they re|port <HI>matters of fact,</HI> we can boldly, and without fear of being put to shame, appeal to the <HI>All-knowing-God,</HI> and to the Numerous <HI>Assembly,</HI> who were Witnesses, that they are undisguised <HI>Truths:</HI> And so far as they contain <HI>Matters of Opinion</HI> on one side or other, we leave you and all others to judge for themselves.</P>
<P>Yet (as we have already intimated) we wou'd not that the matters contended about in these Papers, shou'd be over-magnified on either side: Or that it shou'd be sup|pos'd we differ further than we do: And 'tis a much grea|ter pleasure to us, to offer any thing that may tend to <HI>narrow</HI> and <HI>lessen,</HI> than to <HI>Enhance</HI> the differences there are betwixt you and us. After we had been tir'd with an unpleasing contention, we therefore (as a refreshment to our selves) undertook this more delightful service; here to attempt, so far as may be, (notwithstanding little dif|ferences) to reconcile, and bring nearer to each other the Pious and Sober on both sides. To which end we shall, <HI>first,</HI> mention to you how far, and wherein we appre|hend we are agreed: And thence manifest in the <HI>second</HI> place, how inconsiderable the things are, about which we differ.</P>
<P N="1">I. We are agreed, (without doubt) in every thing that is of absolute necessity to salvation: This is as certain as that there are <HI>Christians</HI> (that are truly such) on both sides; that there are those <HI>that shall be sav'd</HI> on both sides: Nothing that does <HI>Essentially</HI> constitute <HI>Christianity</HI> is controverted betwixt us: And even with reference to this very point of <HI>Baptism,</HI> we are verily perswaded, there is a nearer agreement betwixt the truly Pious and Serious on both sides, than is commonly consider'd. Particularly,</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>(1.) It is, it must needs be agreed by all such, that there is no possibility of salvation, for any Soul in our A|postate World, but only in and thro' Christ, <HI>Act.</HI> 4.12.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(2.) 'Tis also agreed, that the Covenant of Grace does fix the terms, upon which Christ will be a Saviour to any: That thence only it is to be known, whom he will save, and whom he will not be a Saviour to.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB REF="5">(3.) 'Tis also undeniably plain, and what cannot but be agreed amongst us, that according to the Constitution of that Covenant Christ will be the Saviour of none, but such as are <HI>sincerely devoted</HI> to God: He never was, nor will he ever be the Saviour of any others; but such he has alw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ys b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en a Saviour to, <HI>Ier.</HI> 31.33. <HI>Psal.</HI> 119.38. <HI>Heb.</HI> 7.25. Upon these Principles it is, that every serious Soul does devote it self to God in hope. And we doubt not, but you are also agreed with us.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(4.) That such who are Sollicitous about their own salvation, cannot be unconcern'd about the State of their <HI>Infants.</HI> Every Pious Parent will (under the apprehension of that Guilt and Corruption which they inherit with their Nature) with enlarged Affections yearn over their tender little ones, and earnestly cry to God for 'em, and gladly lay hold upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y word of hope concerning 'em. Those amongst you who are Parents, feel and know what is the heart of a Parent towards its Child: And however you are (as all that are truly Christians are) un|f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ignedly concern'd for, and desirous to promote the <HI>common salvation</HI>; yet for your <HI>Infants,</HI> that are so near you, that are (as it were) parts of your selves, you feel yet another kind of con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ern: You cannot with any sa|tisfaction die from 'em; you can't, when they are dying, part with 'em, unless <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ou hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> some ground of hope con|cerning 'em&punc; Nor can any thing afford you Encourage|ment to hope; without som<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> word of Promise.

to him; and look upon your selves as oblig'd to educa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and train 'em up for him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This is what those that are seriously Religious amongst you, do, and dare not but do: Nor is any part of this a Controversie betwixt you and us. Now here is the internal and most excellent part of <HI>Baptism,</HI> in which we are agreed.&mdash;After which, 'tis somewhat to be wonder'd at, that there shou'd be any remaining difference, as to this matter: However, that which can after such Agreements remain a Controversie, must needs be concluded to be of an inferior and less concerning Nature. Which we now therefore come to speak to.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="2">II. The things in which we differ (from what has been already said) appear to be no fundamental ones: Which will also yet farther be manifested, if the things them|selves be particularly consider'd. That which is the Sub|ject of the ensuing Papers, and which is commonly agi|tated betwixt you and us, may be reduc'd to these two heads, <HI>viz.</HI> (1.) Whether we may, and ought to <HI>devote our Infants to God in the Ordinance of Baptism?</HI> And, (2.) Whether in the Administration of it, we be oblig'd to <HI>dip the Person wholly under Water?</HI> As to both which, it must be own'd, we are yet disagreed: You judging the Ordinance of Baptism, which we apply to <HI>Infants,</HI> not to belong to 'em: And while we apprehend <HI>sprinkling</HI> it self, especially <HI>pouring</HI> a little <HI>water</HI> upon the Face of a Per|son, or <HI>dipping his Face alone in water,</HI> to be Lawful in the Administration of this Ordinance; you suppose we are ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ig'd to <HI>dip,</HI> or plunge the Person <HI>wholly</HI> into wa|ter. And while there is a difference in our apprehensi|ons, it must also be concluded, that on one side or the o|ther, there is cert<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inly a mistake: <HI>But</HI> tho' there be a mistake, suppose it to be on your side, or on our's, 'tis far from being a damning one.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. We will first (as we think we have just reason) sup|pose the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">istake to be with you; yet we dare not, nor do A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">count it a fatal, or undoing one. Those of your way, that agree with us as above (and all the Pious and Sober p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f you, we take it, for granted, do) do only differ from us in a Circumstance. You agree with us, that your <HI>Infants</HI> are to be enter'd into Covenant with God in Christ, and seriously devoted to him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> You on|ly
<PB REF="6">
doubt, whether it may be done in <HI>this Ordinance</HI>: Now tho we are perswaded, that they shou'd not only be en|ter'd into Covenant, but also that this solemnity of <HI>Bap|tism</HI> shou'd Accompany, and add force to the surrender we make of 'em to God: Yet we do not Account it so absolutely necessary, as if the salvation either of the Pa|rent or Child were suspended on it. We read indeed that <HI>Baptism saves us,</HI> 1 Pet. 3.21. But the Apostle to pre|vent mistake, immediately explains himself, and tells us, he does not intend it of the External Ceremony, but of the <HI>Answer of a good Conscience:</HI> Our unfeigned consent to the <HI>Baptismal Covenant</HI> for our selves and for those that we have Power to consent, and accept it for; and our sincere devoting our selves and them in that Covenant to God in Christ, is indeed necessary to theirs, and to our own salvation; and this is that <HI>Answer of a good Consci|ence,</HI> which the Apostle calls for: But where this is found, tho' the External Ceremony shou'd be omitted (whether thro' the mistake of the Parent, or thro' the absence of a Minister) we don't think God will, nor are we any of those who dare, pass a sentence of Death in such a Case.
<P>And for the point of <HI>dipping,</HI> we reckon it to be yet much less material: The <HI>necessity of it</HI> we do indeed op|pose; and doubt not but the Ordinance of <HI>Baptism</HI> (so far as concerns this Controversie) is Lawfully Administer'd, if water be apply'd to a Person, in <HI>any other way</HI> or man|ner; so it be done with the awful and solemn mention of the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost: But yet, supposing it be so order'd, that the <HI>Life</HI> of the Person be not hazarded by it; nor any breach made upon the Rules of modesty, we do not Condemn the Practice of <HI>Dipping</HI>: And in those two Cases, all that are truly Pious amongst your selves, must (upon deliberation) needs dis|allow it, as well as we.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. And now we will suppose the mistake to be on our part: We make no difficulty of it, to own that we are fal|lible: As wise and good Men as we are, nay, far wiser and better than we, have been mistaken; and 'tis no wonder if in many things we be so; Nay, we doubt not, but in some things at least, we are so, because we are Men: Tho' we do not know, that in any Principle of Religion we are so, for that we dare not knowingly Err: Wherein so|ever
<PB REF="6">
we are convinc'd of a mistake, we do, and we are willing to retract it: But we may be in an errour, and may not know it: And we will for a while <HI>suppose</HI> (tho' we have never yet seen rea|son to <HI>grant</HI>) that, as to the matters in difference betwixt you and us, we are under a mistake: Yet neither can the mistake on our side endanger the Foundations, supposing we shou'd be mi|staken. For,</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>As to the Point of <HI>Infant-Baptism,</HI> if it shou'd prove to be a mistake, 'tis only a <HI>Circumstantial</HI> one, a mistake as to the <HI>time</HI> of Administration: This is the worst that can be made of it, if we shou'd be mistaken: And where is the damage, supposing we shou'd be <HI>too early</HI> laid under the most-solemn Bonds to be the Lords? Tho' by the way, we see not how <HI>this</HI> can be done <HI>too soon.</HI> We do not, we dare not rest upon our having been bap|tiz'd in Infancy, as if that wou'd of it self save us: We do indeed reckon it to be <HI>Valid Baptism,</HI> and that we do not need to be <HI>Bap|tiz'd again,</HI> when we become Adult; but we don't think our <HI>In|fant-Baptism</HI> will stand instead of <HI>Regeneration,</HI> or exempt us from the necessity of Faith, Repentance, or a life of serious Holiness, when we are Adult; Nay, we look upon our selves (by Vertue of that Baptism) to lie under unalterable Bonds and Obligations hereunto. And now, tho' it shou'd be suppos'd, we are under a mistake, as to the <HI>time,</HI> when this Ordinance shou'd be Admini|stred; yet can it have no hurtful influence upon us, or upon any of those great, and important Principles of Christianity in which we are agreed.</P>
<P>Or again, if you suppose us also mistaken as to the <HI>manner of application,</HI> while we do not (as you) <HI>dip,</HI> or plunge the Person baptiz'd wholly under water, but only apply a small quantity of water to 'em, most commonly by <HI>Pouring</HI> it upon their Faces: Yet neither can this surely, (if a mistake) be by you Accounted a very dangerous one: No part of serious Religion can be thought to be endanger'd by it. The Kingdom of Christ does not consist in <HI>Dipping</HI>; so as that he that is <HI>Dipp'd</HI> shall be sav'd, and he that is <HI>not Dipp'd</HI> shall be Damn'd: You your selves dare not lay so great a stress upon it. What! Shall a Soul that is truly Penitent, and with serious Actings of Faith and Love, gives up it self to God in Christ, a Soul that resolvedly lies at his Foot, that will not wickedly depart from him; Can you think such a Soul shall yet be rejected by him, meerly because in their Bap|tism they were not <HI>Dipp'd</HI> under water! This is what upon seri|ous deliberation, we are perswaded, none of you dare avow.</P>
<P N="3">III. Now then, since it appears, that the matters in contest betwixt you and us (at least amongst the Pious and Sober on
<PB REF="7">
both sides) are so inconsiderable and comparatively small; we wou'd make it the matter of our earnest request to you, that they may accordingly be own'd and look'd upon by you, do not enhance or over-rate the Value of 'em: By this means, a happy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">utual agreement might most probably be effected, however all the ill effects of our remaining disagreements wou'd be prevent|ed or rem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">v'd. (1.) No way more likely than this to promote an <HI>Agreement</HI> amongst us: Apprehensions that the differences are greater, and the mistakes more dangerous than they are, do naturally influence both si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ook with strangenest upon each other, and prejudice 'em against what is, or may be offer'd on ei|ther side: But were it rightly consi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er'd, how little the difference is, it wou'd yet tend to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ake it less; by softening minds on each side, and preparing 'em with greater impartiality to entertain whatever convincing evidence is laid before 'em. Or, (2.) If it wou'd not remove our differences themselves, it wou'd (at least) prevent all the ill effects of 'em: For instance, why might we not love, and live like Christians (notwithstanding the remain|ing differences in our Opinions)? Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> might we not pray with, and for each other? Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> might we not, according to the Rule of the Gospel, look favourably upon each others mistakes, and receive each other to <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Communion,</HI> avoiding doubtful disputations, <HI>Rom.</HI> 14. throughout the Chapter. We solemnly declare, we are ready thus to receive you; we dare not but re|ceive all whom we are perswaded, our Lord himself will re|ceive: Let there not be a breach maintain'd on your Part, while we impose no sinful, or so much as suspected Term of Commu|nion on you. Or, supposing upon one or other mistake, you shou'd think fit to separate your selves from us, from our Assem|blies, yet, at least, we beg, you wou'd in your distinct Assem|blies see to it, that the great and uncontroverted Principles of Christianity may be ordinarily, and with greatest warmth and earnestness insisted on; and let not your Heat and Zeal be laid out upon the little things in which we differ: Let your endea|vours be rather to make Men <HI>Christians,</HI> than to make 'em <HI>Anti|paedobaptists</HI>; and shew that you prefer the interests of our com|mon Lord, before those of your particular Party. For a close, we would leave those Words of the Apostle with you, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.15, 16. <HI>Nevertheless, wherein we have already attain'd, let us walk by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ame Rule, let us mind the same things: And if in any thing ye <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e neve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">-minded, God will reveal even this unto you.</HI></P>

<HEAD>AN INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>MUST I again, be call'd out to engage in this irksome and unpleasing Controversy? Who had much rather spend my time in healing differences, and provoking all Christians to love one another. I have often read with some pleasing satisfaction, those Expressions of Arch-Bishop <HI>Til|lotson,</HI> (that Great Good Man, and National loss.) <HI>I know not (says he) whether St.</HI> Paul,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tillotson,</HI> Pres. to six Ser. on family Religi|on, <HI>pag.</HI> 3.</NOTE> <HI>who had been taken up into the third Heavens, did by that Question of his</HI>; Where is the Disputer of this World? <HI>Intend to insinuate that this wrangling work hath place only in this World, and upon this Earth, where on|ly there is a dust to be raised; but will have no place in the other. But whether St.</HI> Paul <HI>intended this or not, the thing it self I think is true, that in the other World all things will be clear and past dispute; to be sure a|mong the Blessed, and probably also among the miserable, unless fierce and furious Contentions, with great heat, without light, about things of no mo|ment and concernment to them, should be design'd for a part of their torment.</HI> I had much rather be dressing my own Soul for Eternity, and preparing others for those calm and peaceable Regions, where perfect Charity and Good will Reign for ever: Than in fomenting and increas|ing those Divisions among Christians, which are too un|measurably wide already.</P>
<P>My Charity is not confin'd to any particular Sect, or Par|ty of Christians; but I bear a hearty good will to all that agree in the Essentials of Religion, Notwithstanding their

distant Opinions, in matters of an inferior Nature. A re|form'd Catholick Christian, is a Name that pleaseth me better, than any of those distinguishing Titles which the Contentions of Men have occasion'd in the Christian Church. Tho' I was urg'd by many serious Christians, before the dis|putation, to Print my Sermons on this subject, which were manag'd rather in a Practical than Controversal way; Yet so averse was I to foment or Increase differences, that I wil|lingly forbore. And if Dr. <HI>Russel</HI> had only Printed the Imperfect Notes of his own <HI>Scribes,</HI> perhaps we should still have been silent; and left the World to judge between us: but seeing he hath been guilty of so many Notorious Falsehoods and Misrepresentations, both on his side and ours, we are unavoidably constrain'd to Vindicate the Truths of Christ, the common cause of the reformed Churches, and our own Reputation, against the bold insolence of a Scanda|lous Libeller:</P>
<P>The true occasion of my being engag'd in this matter is this: I was invited some years ago, before any <HI>Anabaptist</HI> Meeting was set up at <HI>Gosport,</HI> to Preach a Lecture once a fortnight at <HI>Portsmouth</HI>; which I have continu'd (I bless God with no small success) ever since. In the course of my Lecture, I thought it most adviseable to give my hearers a true and orderly Scheme of the Christian Religion. Hav|ing therefore explain'd the Creed and Lords Prayer (Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> undertaking the Ten Commandments) I did with|out any importunity from others, but purely in the method I had laid down, explain the Doctrine of the Sacraments: Here I largely explain'd the Nature of Baptism, and could not do right to my subject, without defending our own practice as to Infants right, and the way of Administration. Dr. <HI>Russel</HI> himself knows how falsely he hath Publish'd to the World, that I inveigh'd against the Poor <HI>Baptists</HI> (as he calls them) with most severe Reflections: Seeing he hath read those Notes which Mr. <HI>Ring</HI> took of my Sermons. The very hardest expression in those Notes, is the Title of mistaken Brethren. These Sermons Mr. <HI>Samuel Ring,</HI> who, tho' of that perswasion, usually attends our Lecture, pen'd down in short hand, and afterwards wrote out at length; with an Innocent design (as he himself professeth) to shew them to some of his Brethren. <HI>Farmer Bows,</HI> a pre|tended
<PB REF="8">
Messenger of the Churches, hearing of this, appli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s himself to Mr. <HI>Ring</HI> for a sight of these Sermons, and having read them, us'd words to this effect. Shall we bear this? If we suffer Mr. <HI>Chandler</HI> thus to go on, it will prejudice our cause. Mr. <HI>Ring</HI> reply'd, Mr. <HI>Chandler</HI> takes but the same liberty in his own Congregation, to de|fend his own practice, that we do in ours.</P>
<P>But this was not satisfactory. Mr. <HI>Bows</HI> goes over to <HI>Gosport,</HI> to Mr. <HI>John Webber,</HI> Pastor of a Congregation of particular <HI>Anabaptists,</HI> as they are call'd, opposite in their Iudgments, in many great points of Religion, to those in <HI>Portsmouth.</HI> Mr. <HI>Webber</HI> (as he told me himself) was willing to live in Peace, and did not desire to be engag'd: But Mr. <HI>Leddel,</HI> and some others, Men of heat without light, were very urgent, and willing even to accept of <HI>Matthew Caffen</HI> for their Champion, whom Mr. <HI>Bows</HI> propos'd: A Man that denies both the Divinity and Huma|nity of Christ, and is justly protested against, by many of his Brethren, and particularly by Dr. <HI>Russel.</HI> Mr. <HI>Webber</HI> justly refus'd to own <HI>Matthew Caffen,</HI> as a Christian, or a Brother. And therefore, since they would have a dispute, rather propos'd Dr. <HI>Russel.</HI> Accordingly, <HI>December</HI> 21&punc;98. Mr. <HI>Bows,</HI> Mr. <HI>Webber,</HI> and about twenty of their Party came to my Lecture boldly to confront me, when I was Answering the <HI>Anabaptists</HI> Objections. At the Conclu|sion, <HI>Farmer Bows</HI> stands up, and in the Name of the rest Challenges me with Preaching Doctrines false and wholly untrue, and desir'd I would admit of a publick dispute with an ordain'd Minister of the Gospel: This bold Challenge I accepted, provided they would procure a Man that under|stood the regular Laws of disputation, and preliminaries were first settled. Accordingly the next Day, Prelimina|ries were settled and Papers interchang'd, between <HI>Thomas Bows</HI> and <HI>William Leddel,</HI> as asserters of the two Que|stions on the one part: And <HI>Francis Williams,</HI> and <HI>Samuel Chandler,</HI> as deniers of the two Questions on the other Part. This Dr. <HI>Russel</HI> perfectly conceals, in his Account of the Preliminaries, <HI>pag.</HI> 4. Because it would have confuted his slander upon the Learned Dr. <HI>Smith,</HI> as if he design'd, by saying, he that asserts must prove, that the Proof lay upon us; but this is Accounted for elsewhere. Mr. <HI>Webber</HI> after|wards
<PB REF="9">
declares his utter dislike of the dispute, and wish'd i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> had never been: And before my self and Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> deny'd that the Letter in the Name of the Church at <HI>Gosport, Narr. p.</HI> 2. was wrote with his Knowledg or consent. There|fore we Impute not the Falshood of the matter, as if Mr. <HI>Chandler</HI> had inveigh'd against and ridicul'd their Practice; nor the false Grammar in that Letter to him. Mr. <HI>Ring</HI> express'd his hearty sorrow by Letter (as well as otherwise) in these following words &mdash; (after having sent me the notes of my Sermons, and delivered a Copy of the Disputation to Mr. <HI>Smith.</HI>) &mdash; I am troubled at the Sad Effects of the Disputation. I mean the difference it hath rais'd among those, that I hope are all the People of God: And the Grief it may have occasion'd to any of his faithfull Ministers: And most of all that I have contributed any thing towards it: Tho' it hath been by accident and no otherwise: and as I pray God forgive me, so I beg your pardon, and crave a share in your Prayers. I always respected you, as a Minister of Christ Iesus; have pray'd for the Success of your Ministry, and have heard you with a great deal of Satisfaction, and I hope have profited by it; and shall continue to do so, and so at|tend your Ministry without the le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ejudice, and I hope with better Success than formerly.

<P>This is the true Copy of Mr. <HI>Ring's</HI> Letter to me, who according to his promise usually attends our Lecture at <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> Now let the World Iudg whether my Preju|dice against the growth of the Church at <HI>Gosport,</HI> could put me upon this work; or whether I ever inveigh'd against them; many of them can testify to the contrary, to whom <HI>I</HI> have, and shall bear an hearty love and good will; own them as excel|lent Servants of Christ, and be very willing to contribute my Assistance, to help them forward in their way to Heaven. But alas! 'Tis Mr. <HI>Bows</HI> and his party that are afraid of the growth of Mr. <HI>Webbers</HI> Congregation: And therefore did suspend from their Communion, one <HI>Isaac Harman</HI> by Name, a Ioyner in <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> for bearing Mr. <HI>Webber</HI>: this the Young Man told me himself, and ask'd my advice about it; and Mr. <HI>Bows</HI> told me himself before Mr. <HI>Francis Willi|ams,</HI> that if he could Believe that our Doctrine of Original

Sin, he should think Infants had need of Baptism: And won|der'd the People of <HI>Gosport</HI> should Scruple the Practice of Infant Baptism, and yet maintain the Doctrine of Original Sin. This Man it seems wants not express Command or Example, but only to be feelingly acquainted with the uni|versal Corruption of Humane Nature; and then would rea|dily Embrace our Practice. I Pray God open his Eyes, and convince him of this great truth, which is of far greater weight than this of Baptism.</P>

<HEAD>AN ABRIDGMENT OF THOSE SERMONS THAT WERE The Innocent Occasion of the Disputation.</HEAD>
<P>HEre I must unavoidably dip my Pen in the Wa|try Controversy: I love not to meddle with matters of Dispute, especially where Sober and Good Men are at Odds: But I cannot do right to my Subject, without mentioning the Grounds of our Practice, both as to the Subjects of Baptism, and the manner of its Administration. I shall according to the order o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Disputation,</P>
<P>First, mention what I offer'd, as to the Subjects of Bap|tism.</P>
<P N="1"><PB REF="10">1. I shall prove from Scripture, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arrantableness of Infant Baptism, or of the Baptizing the Infants of Believing Parents. Here I shall not burden you with ma|ny Scriptures, that might be produced: but only mention some few that I think most clear.</P>
<P>First From <HI>Mat.</HI> 28.19. <HI>Go, Disciple all Nations Baptizing them.</HI> From hence I thus argue.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Infants of Believing Parents are Disciples, and therefore ought to be Baptiz'd. Now we have a plain Text that these Infants are Disciples, in <HI>Act<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> 15.19. <HI>Why tempt ye God to put a Yoke upon the Necks of the Disciples, which neither our Fathers nor we were able to bear?</HI> This Yoke was that of Circumcision, a ve|ry painful ordinance. Administred to Infants of 8 days old; this Yoke these false Teachers would impose not on|ly on the Gentile Christians but their Infants too, and there|fore St. <HI>Paul</HI> was acus'd by them, that he taught, they should not Circumcise their Children nor Keep the Customs of <HI>Moses, Acts</HI> 21.21. Now when our Saviour says <HI>Go, Disciple all Nations</HI>: The Apostles must need understand, that such as were Disciples in the Jewish State, should be admitted to this ordinance in the Chri|stian Church.</P>
<P N="2">2. Infants are a considerable part of a Nation, and therefore we cannot suppose, they should be excluded, except they were excluded by Name or good Conse|quence.</P>
<P N="3">3. All Nations, is here put in opposition to the one Nation of the Jews. As if our Saviour had said, where|as the Jews have hitherto been the peculiar People of God, and admitted to peculiar Priviledges, now I admit all Nations to the same Priviledges, the Jews only enjoy'd before; <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.12, 13. Now it was a great Privi|ledg among the Jews, that their Infants were dedicated and devoted to God, and admitted into his Church, and Covenant, in their early years; therefore the Apostles must needs understand, when our Saviour said, all Nati|ons should be Discipled, that the Gentiles, and their Children should be admitted to the same Priviledges the Jews enjoy'd before.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="4" REF="11">4. Our Saviour must needs intend Infants unless he had excluded them. If he would not be any longer a God in Covenant with them, he would have raz'd out their Names. Suppose the words had run thus: <HI>Go, Disciple all Nations, Circumcising them</HI>; the Apostles must have understood that their Infants were intended, and why not the same, when only the rite is alter'd? Or suppose it had run, <HI>Go, Disciple the Iews, Baptizing them</HI>; They must needs admit Infants that were ad|mitted before. So that whereas our mistaken Brethren call for an express Scripture for Infant Baptism, we have reason to answer, there needs express Scripture to revoke that Priviledg and Covenant Interest which Infants in|joy'd before. If it had been Christs intention to have excluded Infants from the Church, there must have been a positive Law, where such an intention of Christ should have been express'd: for nothing can make that unlawful, which was a Duty before, but a direct and 'express prohibition from the <HI>Legis|lator</HI> himself; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Stilling-Fleet Iren.</HI> pag. 7.</NOTE> who alone hath Po|wer to Rescind, as well as make Laws. You know there was a great Controversy, whe|ther Circumcision should continue or not, <HI>Acts</HI> 21.21: and certainly there would have been a far greater, if, upon their coming to Christ, their Infants had been excluded the Church, and ranked with Heathens; but seeing we find no Objections made about this matter, nor that our Saviour ever revok'd this Priviledg, we may be assur'd they still enjoy it.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Practice of Baptizing Infants was customary among the <HI>Iews</HI>; those that have but dip'd their fingers in the <HI>Iewish</HI> Writings know, that not only <HI>Proselytes</HI> (as Mr. <HI>Tombs</HI> acknowledgeth) but Native <HI>Iews</HI> them|selves, were admitted into the Church by Circumcision, as an initiating ordinance; by Baptism, as a purifying Cere|mony, to wash them from Legal Uncleanness, which they might ignorantly contract; and by Sacrifice to ex|piate their Sin; and that this was not a Corrupt Traditi|on, but grounded on those many Texts, that require washing from uncleanness: And therefore this Practice is grounded on, <HI>Gen.</HI> 35.2. <HI>Exod.</HI> 19.10. by the
<PB N="5" REF="11">
<HI>Gemera Talmud,</HI> and <HI>Maimonides.</HI> Now therefore seeing Infants were thus admitted by Baptism, and our Saviour was pleas'd to adopt this custom into a Christian Sacra|ment, we have reason to believe that Infants are admit|ted now as before.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another Scripture is in <HI>Acts</HI> 2.38, 39. <HI>Repent and be Baptized, for the promise is to you and to your Children; and to those afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.</HI> The Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> doth in this place perswade those he had convinc'd, of the greatness of their Sin, in murdering the Lord of Glory, penitently to return to God, and then Incoura|ges them to hope, they should again be receiv'd into Favour with God: And, says he, the promise will be made good, not only to you but to your Children too: And to the Gentile World also, Even to as many as the Lord our God shall call. Thence I argue.</P>
<P N="1">1. This promise, was the great promise to <HI>Abraham.</HI> Some pretend it is only that promise in <HI>Ioel</HI> 2.8. Gods giving extraordinary gifts of the Spirit; That their Sons and Daughters should Prophecy. But this cannot be, because that promise was not fullfill'd to all afar off. Have all the Gifts of Tongues? Do all Prophecy? The promise signifys the great promise <GAP DESC="foreign"> to <HI>Abraham, I will be a God to thee and to thy seed, Gen.</HI> 17.17. Therefore this is call'd the promise <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.14. <HI>That the blessing' of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles, thro' Iesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit, thro' Faith.</HI> The Blessing of <HI>Abraham:</HI> That great Blessing that God would be a God to him and his seed. Now if this great Blessing come to the Gentiles, Then they and their seed ought to receive the token of the Covenant; the Children of the promise ought to have the Seal affixed to it.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Apostle useth these words to comfort the <HI>Iews,</HI> that had Imprecated Divine Vengeance on them|selves and their Children, Infants as well as others; a curse that lies on the unbelieving <HI>Iews</HI> to this day: <HI>His blood be upon us and our Children</HI>; no doubt, but many of those, that were prick'd at the heart at <HI>Peters</HI> Sermon, joyn'd with the rabble in that Loud cry; <HI>Crucifie him,
<PB N="6" REF="12">
Crucifie him,</HI> and were concern'd not only for themselves but their Children too; therefore the Apostle uses this Argument, if you penitently return to God by faith in Christ, the curse shall be taken off from you and your Children, you and yours shall be admitted again, and not only so, but those that are afar off, the Gentile World, when call'd.</P>
<P N="3">3. If the words were to be restrain'd, only to those that believe and repent themselves, and concern not their Infants; this would be an Argument to perswade the <HI>Iews,</HI> to continue in the Synagogue still, rather than to come into the Christian Church. While Synagogue worship stood before Christs coming, God had pro|mis'd happy Priviledges, to themselves and Children; but now if afterwards their Children must be cast off, and look'd on as no other than Heathens, and strangers to the Covenants of promise, this would incline them rather to continue in the Synagogue, than enter in|to the Christian Church.</P>
<P>A Third Scripture is in <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.15, 25. In those ver|ses, these following things are containd.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Apostle speaks of breaking off from and gra|sfing into the Visible Church; that the Unbelieving <HI>Iews</HI> were broken off from that Visible Church, to which they were related before, by their positive unbelief, and rejecting Christ; and that the Gentile Believers were graff'd in, and so partook of those Priviledges, from which the Gentiles were broken off.</P>
<P N="2">2. Some only were broken off, the rest that Believ'd, injoy'd the same Priviledges they did before, <HI>v.</HI> 17<HI>th.</HI> Now this was a great Priviledg, that God would be a God to them and to their seed: Therefore they still in|joy'd the same.</P>
<P N="3">3. What Priviledges the <HI>Iews</HI> left, the whole body shall be restor'd to when the fulness of the Gentiles shall come in, <HI>v.</HI> 25. therefore their Infants shall be restor'd to the same Priviledges th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> injoy'd before.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Believing Gentiles are admitted to the Privi|ledges the <HI>Iews</HI> injoy'd before, gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fed into the same Olive-Tree, <HI>v.</HI> 24.

<PB N="7" REF="12">
Gentiles are also in Covenant, and consequently ought to have Baptism, the Seal, applyed to them.</P>
<P N="4">4. A Fourth Scripture is in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.14. <HI>Else were your Children unclean, but now are they holy.</HI> Hence I argue, If the Children of Believers are holy, then this ordi|nance ought to be Administer'd to them. The only diffi|culty here, is to understand what is meant, by holiness in this place.</P>
<P N="1">1. Internal Holiness cannot be ascrib'd to all the In|fants of believers. Because we find by sad experience, that many of them shamefully Apostatize from God, and thereby plainly shew, the Seed of Grace was never in them, 1 <HI>Iohn</HI> 3.9.</P>
<P N="2">2. Neither can it be understood of bare Legitimacy, as our mistaken brethren pretend. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Word is never us'd in this sense, in all the Scripture.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Children of Heathens, if begotten in Lawful Wed|lock, are Legitimate, as well as of Believers; therefore this can be no distinguishing mark, as in this place.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Apostle's Argument would be weak and un|concluding, if he should only prove that they were Lawful Man and Wife, because their Children were Lawfully begotten. The Question propos'd to the Apo|stle was this. Supposing a believing Wife Marry'd to an unbeliever, or <HI>e contra,</HI> whether the believer should dwell with the unbeliever, or part one from another. The Apostle Answers,</P>
<P><HI>If the unbeliever be willing to abide, let them do so, For the unbelieving Wife is sanctified by the Husband, and else were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">our Children unclean, but now are they Holy.</HI> Because one Parent is a believer, therefore their Children are peculiarly related to God, and in Covenant with him.</P>
<P>Now if bare Legitimacy were intended, then the Ar|gument would run thus: You have no Reason to questi|on, whether you are Man and Wife, because your Chil|dren are Lawfully begotten. Can any believe any could question the one, and yet grant the other?</P>
<P N="4">4. This would not answer the <HI>Corinthians</HI> Scruple: They did not question, whether co-habiting with Unbe|lievers,
<PB N="8" REF="13">
expos'd them to Fornication; but, whether it would expose them to Irreligion, or at least, great Tem|ptations. Now, says the Apostle, <HI>How Knowest thou, O Man, but thou may'st save thy Wife?</HI> However, your Children are holy, because one is a believer.</P>
<P N="3">3. By holiness is meant Relative or Federal Holiness. That the Children of Believers are Separated to God, enter'd into a new Relation to him, by vertue of his Covenant. Thus the <HI>Israelites</HI> are said to be a holy Peo|ple, because Separated to God as his peculiar Treasure, <HI>Deut.</HI> 14.2.26.19. the Infants of Believing Parents are thus holy, as related to God and enjoying distinguishing marks of Favour, therefore ought to have this distinguish|ing ordinance apply'd to them?</P>
<P N="2">2. What Priviledges are the Infants of Believers In|vested in by Baptism?</P>
<P N="1">1. They are solemnly admitted into the Visible Church; no longer strangers to the Covenants of Promise, but more nearly related to God, than the Infants of Hea|thens.</P>
<P N="2">2. Peculiarly interested in the Churches Prayers; we are bound indeed to pray for all Men, but more peculi|arly for the Church of God, <HI>Gal:</HI> 6.16.</P>
<P N="3">3. Have a Title to Gods peculiar care. God gives his Angels a charge over them, <HI>Mat.</HI> 18.10.</P>
<P N="4">4. They stand nearer to, and are the more especial Objects of the promises of Grace, <HI>Is.</HI> 44.3.59. In|fants are call'd by Gods Name, therefore tho' Gods Grace is free, yet we have more Reason to hope, the promises will be made good to them than others. The vein of Election frequently runs in the Channel of Believing Parents, and their seed.</P>
<P N="5">5. They are put into a new Covenant Relation. As <HI>Abraham</HI> receiv'd the sign of Circumcision, as a Seal of the Righteousness of Faith, to himself and seed, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.11. So this ordinance of Baptism, shall be a Seal of the Righ|teousness of Faith, to Believers and their seed.</P>
<P N="6">6. If they dye during their Infant State, they shall be saved. Our Saviour useth this Argument for the proof of the Resurrection. <HI>I am the God of Abraham, Mat.</HI> 22.32. Now for God to be the God of any, is
<PB N="9" REF="13">
to distinguish them from others by his rewards; he did not do thus for <HI>Abraham,</HI> and his Family, in this World, therefore there is another, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.16. Now when God is said to be a God to Believers and their seed, the mean|ing is, he will be a rewarder of them; therefore if they dy in their Infant State, they have a promise to rely on, that God will receive them to Salvation. Whereas others must leave their Children to the unfathomable depths of Divine Mercy, as they do the Heathen World.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Practical uses of Infant Baptism beyond that of Years. This I do the rather, to take off the Common Objection, that Infant Baptism is an useless Ordi|nance.</P>
<P N="1">1. By Baptizing our Infants we practically own our Original Pollution. Those Baptiz'd at R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">per Years own themselves Sinners by Practice; but do not necessarily own, that there is a Fountain of Sin within: But when we offer our Children to be Baptiz'd, we acknowledg that we have been Instruments of conveying polluted Natures to our Infants; and that they need washing by the Blood and Spirit of Christ. Thus the Prophet sets forth our sinful State, by the Pollutions of a new born In|fant, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 16.4.</P>
<P N="2">2. Hereby we practically acknowledg the Necessity of Gods free Grace in order to our recovery. As an Infant cannot contribute to his Baptism, but is purely passive; So we can contribute nothing, by any Work or Merit of our own, towards obtaining the Grace of God, and Regenerating Influences of his Spirit. <HI>It is not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth, but in God that shew|eth Mercy, Rom.</HI> 9.16.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hereby we practically own Christs universal Head|ship, that he is Lord of all, of all Ages, Sexes, and Conditions. Those that deny their Children, to be in Covenant with God, hereby deny them to be Visible Members of Christ; And thus rob him of a great part of his Subjects, and indeed rob themselves of that com|fort they might enjoy: they look upon their Infants, as in the same case and State, with the Heathen World. If Christ save them, it is by a Prerogative of Mercy, and not as his Members or Covenant Children; but <HI>for this
<PB N="10" REF="14">
cause Christ both Died, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d Rose, and reviv'd, that he might be the Lord, of the Dead and Living. Rom.</HI> 14.9. and as Christ whilst an Infant himself, was head of the Church, so he is pleas'd to admit of Infant Members, in Covenant with him.</P>
<P N="4">4. Infant Baptism lays stronger Obligations on Parents, to train up their Children for God. Certainly tis a mighty Obligation on a Parent to consider. 1. I have
<HI REND="margQuotes">Solemnly devoted my Child to God. Solemnly promis'd, before the Minister, and in the Face of a great Congrega|tion, that I will Endeavour by hearty Prayers, Serious Instructions, and a Religious Example, to train up my Child for God; the vows of the Lord are upon me, and I shall add perjury to the rest of my Sins, if I Neg|lect them.</HI>
The Prophet makes it, a great Agravati|on of the <HI>Israelites</HI> Sin, that they had taken their Sons and Daughters that they had Born unto God, and Sacra|fic'd them to Idols. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 16.21. and it follows, <HI>Thou hast slain my Children.</HI> God calls them his Children, as born in his Family, and Solemnly devoted to him. So the sin of Christians will be highly aggravated, if they bring up their Children for the destroyer, and Neglect those Parental Instructions, they have oblig'd themselves to.</P>
<P N="5">5. Infant Baptism Engages Children to acquaint them|selves, with the Terms and Tenour of the Covenant. When Children are told by their Parents, how Solemnly they were enter'd into Covenant with God, this engages them to enquire betimes, what they are by Nature, what they may be by Grace, and to understand all the Principles of Religion, in order to that end.</P>
<P N="6">6. Infant Baptism Engages us against Sin Betimes. We are prepossess'd with a happy Prejudice against Sin, in our Early Years; and this is a great advantage. <HI>When Hannibal was but 9 years Old, his Father made him la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his hand upon the Altar, and Swear, that he would be an Irreconcilable Enemy to the Romans</HI>: And this was the Reason he would never admit of any Peace with them. My Friends, we were Engaged for God against Sin, and the Devil, as our Irreconcilable Enemies, not at 9 Years Old, but in our Infant State; and this obliges us to maintain a constant Enmity against them for ever.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="11" REF="14">7. Infant Baptism is a great Encouragement for Faith in Prayer, with Respect to our Children. Those that have dedicated their Children to God in Baptism, may pray to God, with larger Measures of Faith and Hope, than such as have Neglected this Duty. They may say,
<HI REND="margQuotes">Lord I have resign'd them up unto thee; Brought them to thine Authoriz'd Representative to be listed into thy Family; consented for them, to the claims of thy Co|venant; and the token of thy Covenant, hath been ap|ply'd to them; let the Promises of thy Covenant be made good to them. They are call'd by thy Name, do thou receive them: They are Visible Members of thy Church. Oh give them the Favours that belong to thy Children.</HI>
A Visible Relation to God is a good Encou|ragement for Faith in Prayer. <HI>We are call'd by thy Name: Thou bearest not Rule over them. Ier.</HI> 14.9. Those that have not thus dedicated their Children to God, can only say, Lord be Merciful to them, tho' they are not call'd by thy Name, and make them thine. But we have a better Plea; and can say, Lord they are call'd by thy Name.</P>
<P N="8">8. Infant Baptism adds to the Parents comfort. They may comfortably hope as to their living seed, that if they are Faithful in training them up for God, he will according to his promise, <HI>Is.</HI> 44.3. pour out his Spirit and Blessing upon them: and as to those that die in an Infant State, they have Reason to Believe and hope, that they are happy, because God hath promis'd to be a God to them, and to their seed: Whereas those that Neglect this ordi|nance have no more Reason to hope for the Salvation of their Infants, than the Heathens; must only leave them, to the unfathomable depths of Gods Goodness, having no promise to rely upon.</P>
<P N="4">4. I shall answer some Principal Objections against this Truth.</P>
<P N="1">1. There is no Precept nor Example for Infant Bap|tism, in all the New Testament; This is a Common Objection, and therefore deserves a distinct answer,</P>
<P N="1">1. To this I Answer: What Express Command or Ex|ample can they produce for previous Examination of Per|sons that offer themselves to be Baptiz'd; for Stated
<PB N="12" REF="15">
Prayer, before and after this Ordinance; or for dipping or Plunging the whole Body under Water? All these things must be deduc'd by consequence; for no express Scripture can be produc'd for them. I may add, what ex|press Command have they for singing Psalms in Rhime and Metre, which is the Practice of the most Orthodox Anabaptists at this day? I mention this the rather, to convince Mr. <HI>Webber</HI> and his adherents, what a doughty Champion they have chosen for themselves. For this Dr. <HI>Russel</HI> hath written some Animadversions on his Brother <HI>Allen</HI>'s Essay, on singing Psalms; wherein he advances the very same Arguments, against their Practice of singing Psalms, that he doth against ours for Infant Baptism; and therefore hath prov'd himself a Hackny dis|putant, that hath one constant Road, and train of Argu|ments, upon all occasions. Perhaps I may be so dull of Ap|prehension, as not to be able to Answer them, therefore must cry, Men of <HI>Israel</HI> help. <HI>The Arguments of</HI> Russel <HI>against Allen, pag.</HI> 9.</P>
<Q><P>If it doth not appear from Scripture, or any Authentic. History, that the Psalms of <HI>David</HI> were Translated into Rhime or Metre till the 16<HI>th</HI> Century, then it is Impossible any Church could so sing them, as our Brethren now do; the <HI>Major</HI> is undeniable, the <HI>Minor</HI> I thus prove.</P>
<P>If it be so recorded, you or some other are able to show it.</P>
<P>Further, if Singing in Rhime or Metre was never practic'd in any Church, till the 16<HI>th</HI> Century, then it was, because our Lord Jesus had not commanded it so to be.</P>
<P>If our Lord had Commanded it&punc; his Apostles would have so taught the Churches.</P>
<P>If the Apostles were faithful in the discharge of their Ministry, and kept back nothing, that was profitable to the Churches, but declar'd to them the whole Councel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> God, then they did teach the Churches all that the Lord Jesus Commanded.</P></Q>
<P>If the Apostles did teach the Churches to sing in Rhime and Metre, then it is somewhere so recorded in the New Testament. Thus argues this mighty Man of Logick; but as he cannot distinguish between Rhime and
<PB N="13" REF="15">
Metre, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o I can see&punc; neither Rhime nor Reason in his discourse: these were the Arguments for want of better, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th at <HI>Portsmouth</HI>; but Mr. <HI>Webber</HI> (to whose Civility I am indebted, for a sight of this curious peice,) must either Renounce his beloved Rhimes, or comply with the Practice of Infant Baptism, notwithstanding the Wonderful Arguments of his Champion to the con|trary. But to return from this digression.</P>
<P N="2">2. Those Truths that were Establish'd in the Old Testament, are rather suppos'd than positively express'd in the New; but the Grounds and Foundations upon which Infant Baptism stands, were Establish'd in the Old Testament. Infants were then admitted into the Covenant and Church of God: Except therefore Christ had blotted their Names out of the Covenant, and Rolls of the Church; They are to be continued there, under the New Testament. Thus a Magistracy was setled under the Old Testament, but there is no precept for it under the New; the Lawfulness of War was then setled, but suppos'd, not expres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> under the New. The forbid|den degrees of Marriage, were setled under the Old Testament: No need of mentioning them again under the New.</P>
<P N="3">3. Ans. There are many Virtual and General Com|mands for the Baptizing of Infants in the New Testa|ment, which were mention'd before.</P>
<P N="4">4. Ans. There was no need of an express Command, because it was the constant Practice of the Church, when the Scripture was written, in conformity to the Practice of the <HI>Iews,</HI> for many Ages before. I cannot here express my self better, than in the words of the Learned <HI>Lightfoot</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Lightfoots Har|mony on</HI> Joh. 1 25.</NOTE> If Bap|tism and Baptizing of Infants had been as strange and unheard of a thing, till <HI>Iohn</HI> Baptist came; as Circumcision was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">till God appointed it to <HI>Abraham</HI>; There would then no doubt, have been an express Command for Baptizing Infants, as there was for Circumcising them. But when the Baptizing of In|fants, was a thing commonly known and us'd, as appears by Uncontestable Evidence from all their Writers; there need not be express Assertions, that such and such Per|sons
<PB N="14" REF="16">
were to be the Objects of Baptism, when it was as well known before the Gospel began, that Men, Women and Children were Baptiz'd, as it is to be known that the Sun is up when it shines at noon day.</P>
<P N="5">5. There would need a Positive Command, to exclude Infants, who were admitted into Covenant before. The <HI>Iews</HI> were extremely tender of their Priviledges, and you know there was a great dispute among them, whe|ther their Children should be Circumcis'd, <HI>Acts.</HI> 21.21. Now if their Children were wholly cast out of Co|venant, this would have enrag'd them much more; seeing therefore, there is not one word in Scripture, that once mentions the unchurching of Infants, not one A|postle, that once questions or discovers it, the believing <HI>Iews</HI> did not once Scruple it, nor the unbelieving once charge it on Christ; nor the Councel in <HI>Acts</HI> 15. Reveal it, tho they that taught Infants should be Circumciz'd, did suppose they were Church-Members. I say seeing all these things are True, Infants are Church-Members still, and consequently ought to be Baptiz'd.</P>
<P N="6">6. There are Examples of whole Housholds that were Baptiz'd in Scripture, and we may well conclude, as <HI>Abrahams</HI> Children, In <HI>Luk.</HI> 19.9. Christ saith to <HI>Zaccheus, Salvation is come to this House, for that he also is the Son of Abraham. Zaceheus</HI> was a <HI>Publican,</HI> and a ga|therer of the <HI>Roman Tribute,</HI> and perhaps a Gentile, but upon his Faith in Christ, he becomes a Spiritual Son of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and Salvation comes not only to himself, but his House; God becomes a God to him and his. So when we read of so many Housholds Baptiz'd, upon the Pa|rents and Masters Believing, we have Reason to conclude their Infants were Baptiz'd, as <HI>Abraham</HI> and his were Circumciz'd.</P>
<P N="7">7. There is no Instance of any Christian Child, whose Baptism was defer'd still he came to Years. There was great Reason that they who had been <HI>Iews</HI> or Heathens before, should upon their undertaking Christianity, be Baptiz'd at Years: as <HI>Abraham</HI> at the first Institution of Circumcision was Circumciz'd, when he was old; but we may well suppose, their Children (as <HI>Abrahams,</HI>) were Baptiz'd with them, and afterwards in their Infant State.
<PB N="15" REF="16">
Now it is utterly unaccountable, that in that long tract of time, between St. <HI>Mathews Gospel</HI> and the <HI>Revelations,</HI> when many Christian Infants were grown adult, we should read of none that were Baptiz'd, but only of <HI>Iews</HI> and Heathens, I say this is unaccountable, and therefore supposeth they were Baptiz'd in Infancy.</P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> 2. Infants are uncapable of performing the Duties prerequir'd to Baptism. Of confessing their Sins, <HI>Mat.</HI> 3.6. Of Repenting, <HI>Acts</HI> 2.38. Of gladly receiving the word, <HI>Acts</HI> 2.41. Of Believing, <HI>Mar.</HI> 16.16.</P>
<P N="1">1. Infants are admitted on the account of their Pa|rents faith. As the Infants of Believing <HI>Iews,</HI> so are the Infants of Christians; nor is this at all unreasonable. For as Infants contract Guilt from their Parents, why may they not also partake of Mercy, on account of their Parents; except God be more inclin'd to Acts of Justice, than Mercy&punc; As many were heal'd of their Bodily diseases, by the faith of their Parents, <HI>Math.</HI> 15.28. So why may they not be admitted into Gods Church on the same account? As the <HI>Iewish</HI> Infants, Covenanted with God, in and by their Parents, <HI>Deut.</HI> 29.11.12. So why may not Christian Infants Covenant in and by them? As Children are said to come to Christ, being brought in the Arms of their Nurses or Parents, <HI>Luk.</HI> 18.15.16. So why may they not be said Spiritually to come to Christ, in the Arms of their Parents Faith? As Parents enter their Childrens Names in Leases and Covenants, and the Chil|dren are oblig'd to stand to these Covenants, and do In|joy these Priviledges, when they come to Years: So why may they not enter their Childrens Names into the Cove|nant, and Church of God, tho' at present they are unca|pable of Personally Engaging themselves?</P>
<P N="2">2. Infants are oblig'd to these duties as soon as they are capable; and their Early Engagements in Baptism, lay the more strong and forcible Obligation upon them to do so. If afterwards they revolt from God, their Sin will be more highly aggravated, as adding Perjury and Apostacy to the rest of their Sins: and this may be one Reason why, sometimes, the Children of Believers are worse than others, because they Sin against greater Light and Love, and stronger Engagements than other men, and there+fore
<PB N="16" REF="17">
justly provoke the Holy Spirit to forsake them. The <HI>Levites</HI> of a Month Old are said to keep the charge of the Sanctuary, because they were devoted to this Office, and bound to it when capable, <HI>Num.</HI> 3.28. So the Infants of Believers are devoted to the Service of God: And bound to Believe, repent, confess their Sins, and gladly receive the word, as soon as capable.</P>
<P N="3">3. These Texts therefore only shew what was requir'd of grown Persons, when Baptism was first appointed in the Christian Church. Those Persons were either <HI>Iews</HI> or Heathens before, and therefore must Renounce their former Errors, and profess the Christian Faith; but this is no Prejudice against Infants who are to be admitted with them. As when <HI>Abraham</HI> was Circumciz'd, he first Be|liev'd in God, and Submitted to this Ordinance, but af|terwards the Infants of the <HI>Iews</HI> were Circumciz'd in their Infant State<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">: So if we were to Preach to the <HI>Indi|ans,</HI> we must first perswade them to Believe and Repent before Baptism; but when once they had Believ'd, their Infants would have the same right with themselves.</P>
<P N="4">4. As to <HI>Mar.</HI> 16.16. because many are apt to insist on the order of the words, and argue that Faith is put before Baptism, and therefore ought to preceed it,</P>
<P>I Answer: The order of the words is not always to be exactly regarded. For confessing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f Sin is put after Baptism<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Matth.</HI> 3.6. Besides, this would condemn all Infants; for, if, because they cannot Believe, they ought not to be Baptiz'd, then for the same Rea|son they must all be damn'd. 'Tis not positively said he that is not Baptiz'd shall be damn'd; Baptism is not of Absolute: Necessity to Salvation: But it is positively said, he that Believeth not sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll be damn'd. If the latter part of this verse be Interpreted of Grown Persons, so also must the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> former. As for Grown Persons, Faith must go before Baptism: But it doth not follow, that Infants are hence excluded from Baptism, no more than&punc; from Salvation. Our Saviour doth therefore here, only give a general direction to his Apostles, to Preach the Gospel to every Creature, and admit the Gentiles to the same Priviledges with the <HI>Iews,</HI> and shews them the Issue of the Execution of their Commission; that those
<PB N="17" REF="17">
<HI>Iews,</HI> or <HI>Heathens</HI> that would renounce their former Ido+latry, and be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eving y submit to the Ordinance, as a So|lemn Entrance into the Church, should be saved; bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> those that wilfully persisted in unbelief, shou'd be damn'd. So that this is no Preju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ice to Infants, who are still in Cove|nant with God thro their Parents Faith, and were never cast out.</P>
<P>I proceed to the 2d General Question. After what man|ner, the outward Element in Baptism, ought to be ap|ply'd, whether by dipping or plunging the whole Body under Water, or whether pouring Water on the Face be not sufficient? To which I Answer,</P>
<P N="1">1. It is not Absolutely Necessary that this Ordinance should be administred by dipping or plunging the whole Body under the Water. There are many mistaken Bre|thren lay too great a stress on this; but it proceeds from their ignorance of the Scriptures.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Holy Ghost, never uses <GAP DESC="foreign">, which most frequently fignifys to dip, but <GAP DESC="foreign">: Now why should the Holy Ghost consecrate a new World for this Ordinance; if dipping had been the only way of admini|string it? Now <GAP DESC="foreign"> is always us'd where dipping is signify'd. <HI>Mat.</HI> 26.23. <HI>Ioh.</HI> 13.26. <HI>He that dippeth with me in the dish. Luk</HI> 16.24. <HI>dip his finger. Rev.</HI> 19.13. <HI>with Garments dip'd in Blood.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Greek</HI> word <GAP DESC="foreign">, is us'd in a differing sense in Scripture. Thus you read, <HI>Mar.</HI> 7.4. <HI>The Pharisees eat not except they wash oft.</HI></P>
<P>Now the way of washing among the <HI>Iews,</HI> was this; a Servant was ready to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur water, on his Masters hands, hence <HI>Elisha</HI> is thus describ'd. 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 3.11. <HI>Here is</HI> Elisha <HI>that pour'd Water on the hands of his Master</HI> Eli|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ah. So we read of washing of cups and pots, Brasen Vessels, and Tables or Beds. <HI>Mar.</HI> 7.4. the <HI>Greek</HI> word is <HI>Baptizo.</HI> Surely they did not carry them out to a River and dip them there, but pour'd water on them, and so made them clean. Again, <HI>Heb.</HI> 9.10. we read of divers wash|ings; <HI>Baptisms</HI> in the <HI>Greek.</HI> Now what were these Bap|tisms but <HI>v.</HI> 13.21. <HI>Moses</HI>'s Sprinkling the Book and all the People, with the Blood of <HI>Calves</HI> and <HI>Goats</HI> and Water. So that <GAP DESC="foreign"> and <GAP DESC="foreign"> signify the same thing. Let not Injudicious People therefore pretend, that ours is only <HI>Rantism,</HI> when we find in Scripture that <HI>Rantism</HI>;
<PB N="18" REF="18">
and Baptism are us'd promisc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ously for the same.</P>
<P N="3">3. There is no certainty that dipping was ever usd in Scripture times. All those Scriptures that are commonly urg'd to this purpose, may be easily apply'd another way. If we begin with <HI>Iohn</HI> the Baptist, he is said to Baptize not in, but with Water, as Christ with the Holy Ghost and Fire. <HI>Luk.</HI> 3.16. Now how did Christ Baptize with the Holy Ghost and Fire? but at the day of pentecost when the Holy Ghost was pour'd on them. <HI>Acts.</HI> 10.45. I know the learned <HI>Casaubon</HI>'s witty Criticism that in <HI>Acts</HI> 2. when the Holy Ghost came upon them it is said; <HI>There came a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound from Heaven as of a rushing might<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> wind, and it fill'd the House.</HI> So that they were as in a Fish Pond Overwhelm'd with the Holy Ghost. But to this I Answer, it was the sound that fill'd the House, and not the Cloven Tongues of Fire, which were the Em|blems of the Holy Ghost, and sure they were not Over|whelm'd wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h these; but that promise was made good. I will pour out my Spirit. <HI>Acts</HI> 2.17. Now the pouring out of the Spirit, is frequently represented by pouring out water, <HI>Is.</HI> 44.3.</P>
<P>But several Scriptures are pretended for dipping; the most material are these.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Mat.</HI> 3.16. <HI>Iesus went up out of the water.</HI></P>
<P>I Answer, he might acording to the Practice of those times, go into the Water to wash his Feet, foul with Travelling, and <HI>Iohn</HI> might pour Water on his Face; but the <HI>Greek</HI> word may be render'd, he went up from the Water. The like Answer may be given to <HI>Mar.</HI> 1.9. <HI>Iesus was Baptiz'd of Iohn in Iordan.</HI> It doth not prove his whole Body was plung'd there. Nay <GAP DESC="foreign"> frequently signifys <HI>to,</HI> and if we compare this place with <HI>Mat.</HI> 3.13. <HI>Iesus came from Nazareth of Galilee to Iordan to be Baptized of Iohn.</HI> So here we may read the words with a Parenthesis&punc; <HI>And Iesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, (and was Baptiz'd of Iohn) to Iordan</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Another Scripture is <HI>Ioh.</HI> 3.23. <HI>Iohn Baptized in Enon, because there was much Water there.</HI></P>
<P>I Answer, much Water may be meant not of depth but length, many streams and Rivulets, where <HI>Iohn</HI> and his Disciples might conveniently together Baptize or pour Water on the Multitudes.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="19" REF="18">3. Another Scripture is <HI>Acts</HI> 8.38. where <HI>Philip</HI> and the <HI>Eunuch</HI> are said both to go down into the Water; whence some would infer that the <HI>Eunuch</HI> was dip'd. I Answer, they might only go down to, and come from the Water. So the <HI>Greek</HI> may be render'd, the Water running in the valleys. B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t if Men will insist on the let|ter of the Text, <HI>Phillip must dip himself as well as the Eunuch</HI>; for they both went down. Or they might go ankle deep, and <HI>Philip</HI> might pour Water on his Head or Face: either of these interp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">etations are probable, and therefore it cannot Necessari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y be prov'd he was dipt; besides the unlikelihood that he was dipt on a Journey, when perhaps he might have no cloaths to change.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Principal Scripture they boast of, is <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.4. <HI>Being Buried with Christ in Baptism.</HI> Whence they argue B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ism must represent a Burial, therefore the whole B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dy must be cover'd with Water. This Text we have given a distinct Answer to, in our Reflections on Dr: <HI>Russel, Chap.</HI> 2. <HI>Refl.</HI> 12.13. therefore thither I Refer the Reader, and shall only say here,</P>
<P N="1">1. It is no where said that Baptism represents Christs Burial, but only that we are oblig'd to conform our selves thereby to Christs Death, Burial, and Resurrection, to die to Sin, and rise again to newness of Life: This we do whatever ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e be us'd.</P>
<P N="2">2. In our way (if that will satisfy) there is a Repre|sentation of Christs Death&punc; the pouring out of Water denoting the pouring his Blood or Soul; of his Burial, as the Face the Principal part of the Body, is put un|der the Water; of his Resurrection when the Child is taken up and deliver'd again to its Parents or O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e|rers.</P>
<P N="3">3. If they will keep strictly to the Significancy of a Burial; the Person to be Baptiz'd, must not walk into the Water, but be taken up by the Baptizer and cast down into it: for indeed the difference between our way and theirs is only this, we Baptize the face and they Bap|tize the head and shoulders too.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Metaphors</HI> must not be stretched too far, and let our Brethren take heed, how they stretch this Expressi|on so, as to Justify the Practice of others, that differ
<PB N="20" REF="19">
from them; you read <HI>v.</HI> 6. <HI>our Old Man is Crucify'd with Christ.</HI> H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ce the <HI>Romanists</HI> infer the Necessity of Crossing in Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ism; let not the <HI>Metaphor</HI> therefore be stretch'd too <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ar.</P>
<P N="5">5. There are many more Scriptures, that have an Al|lusion to Sprinkling or pouring Water on the Face: thus we r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad <HI>Is.</HI> 44.3. <HI>I will pour Water on him that is thirsty, &amp;c.</HI> which is Interpreted of Gods pouring out his Spirit, and Blessing on the seed of Believers. So <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.22. <HI>Having your Hearts Sprinkled from an Evil Consci|ence, and your Bodys wash'd with pure Water</HI>: And many other places. So that our way most fairly Represents the Death, Burial and Resurrection of Christ, together with the Application of his Blood, and Spirit; and the Anabaptists of <HI>Amsterdam</HI> are so sensible of this, that they Generally Baptize by pouring Water upon the Head.</P>
<P N="4">4. There is great probability, (if not certainty) that many were not dip'd in Scripture times. Particularly <HI>Acts</HI> 2.41. we read of 3000 Baptiz'd in part of a day. And this was at <HI>Ierusalem</HI> where there were no Rivers, but only the Brook <HI>Cedron.</HI> Besides these were either dipt naked, or with their Cloaths; if Naked, this would be an unseemly sight, and look as if they were full of New Wine indeed, tho' (by the way) I think that part, that is Baptiz'd, ought to be Naked, to Represent our Nakedness before God: if with their Cloaths this would be as strange, for it cannot be expected, they brought Cloaths with them at that Jun|cture, and it would have been very unseemly, to see so many Persons come out of the Water in such a condi|tion&punc; and go down to their Houses, which might be at a great distance; not to mention that it was hardly possi|ble, for the 12 Ap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">les, if we should add the 70 Disci|ples to them (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he Text mentions not) to dip 3000 in so sho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t a time, they had need have brawny Arms and an <HI>Here<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">an</HI> strength to do this.</P>
<P>Again we read <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts</HI> 9.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.18. that <HI>Saul</HI> after 3 days fasti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s Baptiz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d by <HI>Ananias,</HI> we read not that he wen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> out of the Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e; nor is it probable, that God (<HI>who will have Mercy and not Sacrifice,</HI>) would at that time require, he should be plung'd in Cold Water,
<PB N="21" REF="19">
which might Prejudice his Health o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Life.</P>
<P>Again <HI>Acts</HI> 16.33. The Jaylor and all his were Bap|tiz'd at midnight. 'Tis unlikely they went to a River at that time.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is not the quantity of Water, but the quality that is Significant. As in the other Sacrament we are Commanded to Eat Bread and drink Wine in Remem|brance of Christ; So in this to be wash'd in the Name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost: and as in the other, it is not said what quantity of Bread we shall Eat, or Wine we shall Drink; So neither in this, after what manner the Water shall be apply'd, whether by dipping, Sprinkling or pouring Water on the Face. It might be equally pre|tended, that we must Eat and Drink plentifully at the Lords Table, because this best sets forth a Feast, as it is call'd 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.8. or Eat a whole Loaf to represent our partaking of Christs fulness, and receiving from him Grace for Grace: there is as much Necessity for this, as for dipping, to represent our Burial with Christ. But as a small bit of Bread, and Moderate Draught of Wine, doth significantly represent the Death of Christ; so a little Water doth as significantly Represent the cleansing vir|tue of Christs Blood.</P>
<P N="6">6. It is very unlikely that dipping, which when mention'd in Scripture, is generally us'd as a token of Gods Vengeance, should in this Sacrament be us'd as a token of his Mercy. Thus the Old World was dip'd and drown'd for their Sins, Gods Vengeance fol|low'd them, and they sunk as lead in the Mighty Waters:</P>
<P>But <HI>Noah</HI> and his Family, whose entrance into the Ark, was a Type of Baptism, as that is an Entrance into the Christian Church 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.21. They were only wet with the Rain they met with in their passage. Thus the <HI>Egyptians</HI> were dip'd and drown'd in the Red-Sea, but the <HI>Israelites</HI> were Baptiz'd unto <HI>Moses,</HI> in the Cloud and the Sea, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.2. by the dewings of the Cloud, and dashing of the Waves. Thus the Lord Jesus shall come down from Heaven, to render Vengeance on his Antichristian Enemies, with Garments dipt in Blood. <HI>Rev.</HI> 19, 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.

<HEAD>Mr. <HI>Chandler</HI>'s Prologue.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is not out of Pride or Vanity, that I now appear in this Place, upon this occasion. Most of you know; and I suppose many of you have heard, that, in the course of my Lecture here, I have been dis|coursing of the Principles of Religion: And having explain'd the Creed and the Lord's Prayer, did un|dertake to treat of the Doctrine of the Sacraments, particularly that of <HI>Baptism.</HI> Those that then heard me know, that I spake with a great deal of Modesty, calling those who deny <HI>Infant-Baptism,</HI> by no hard|er Name than <HI>Mistaken Brethren</HI>; when I was unavoidably engag'd in this Disputation by a bold and confident Challenge given me, which I knew not how to refuse, unless I would betray that Truth which I believe to be the Truth of the Gospel. They themselves not being able to answer the Arguments I then used, have cryed out, <HI>Men of</HI> Israel, <HI>come and help</HI>; and therefore have sent for this Gentleman from <HI>London.</HI> Now I desire that all things may be managed with the greatest Fairness and&punc; Calmness, that we may debate of these matters as Christians, that nothing may be done that is tumultuous or dis|orderly: And, as we have the Favour of the Govern|ment
<PB N="2" REF="22">
both Civil and Military, so, that we may give them no occasion to repent of giving this Liberty. And I hope we shall all of us be willing to submit to the Truth, as it is revealed in the Gospel, and lay our selves open to Conviction. I have no more to add, but desire all of you to joyn with me in this one Request, That God would grant that Truth may pre|vail.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Russel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do suppose it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> be necessary to understand, how much of this, that we affirm, Mr. <HI>Chandler</HI> owns, that we may not dispute about those things wherein we are a|gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d; whether you do own, that Adult Believers are the proper Subjects of Baptism?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Chand.</SPEAKER>
<P>If they were not baptized in Infancy, they ought to be so at Age.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>You do suppose then that they are to be baptized by vertue of some Com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ission, and that, the Commission of our Lord Jesus Christ.</P>

<P>Yes.</P>

<P>Then with respect to the first Question, <HI>Whether A+dult believers only, or whether Infants also may be admitted to Baptism?</HI> And I suppose you do expect that I should be Opponent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Chan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, that was agreed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Well then, I shall endeavour (God assisting) to prove, <HI>Infants are not, according to Christ's Commission, the proper Subjects of Baptism.</HI></P>

<P>If Christ hath no where required any of his Mini|ster

</SP>

<SPEAKER>Chan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I distinguish here upon your Antecedent.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you suppose that Christ hath no where requi|red it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Chan.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. Distinguish between express words and good consequential Proofs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rus.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's necessary the peop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e should know w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">at Mr <HI>Chandler</HI> means; and therefore &mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robinson.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's fit indeed they should know what he means; but it's also fit he should explain his own mean|ing. You must not be permitted to e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">plain Mr. <HI>Chandler</HI>'s meaning in your own words. Your business is to prove what he denies.</P>

<P>I do hope, Gentlemen, that you will not thus break in upon us.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now if you will be silent, and Mr. <HI>Chandler</HI> be plea|sed to tell me what part of my Argument he denies, I shall proceed in the defence of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Chan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Repeat your Argument then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>If Christ hath no where required any of his Mini|sters to baptize Infants, then the Baptism o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Infants is not according to the Commission of our Lord J. C. But Christ hath no where required, <HI>&amp;c. Ergo.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Chan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here, I say, as to the <HI>Major</HI>: If you mean by re|quiring, Christ's expresly Requiring in so many words, that Infants shall be baptized, then I deny the Consequence; but if you mean, that by genuine consequence it cannot be drawn from Scripture; I deny the <HI>Minor.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rus.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Term is very lax. I do not say, that he hath no

where commanded it, but no where required it. If it be any where required, it's enough. Give a direct Answer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>VVill you allow good Scripture Consequence to be Proof in this case; or do you expect Scripture words ex|presly? Let us not dispute in the dark.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, you that are Notaries, pray observe how ambiguously Mr. <HI>Russel</HI> expresseth himself. He will not say whether he'll allow just Scripture consequence for sufficient Proof.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I give my Sense in as plain words as I can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you have it in express words, or good Consequence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Williams.</SPEAKER>
<P>No reason for such a Di|stinction, because our brother hath said <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Any way; before, the words were any where.</HI></NOTE> <HI>any way.</HI></P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Chand.</SPEAKER>
<P>I deny your Minor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I prove it thus. Only I would let the people know what you say, <HI>viz.</HI> That Christ hath <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Somewhere. The word is again altered from</HI> any way <HI>to</HI> some|where.</NOTE> <HI>somewhere</HI> required his Ministers to baptize Infants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Either expresly, or by Just Consequence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rus.</SPEAKER>
<P>If Christ hath any where required any of his Mini|sters to baptize Infants, then it is somewhere so recorded in the holy Scripture. But it is no where so recorded in the holy Scripture. Therefore.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Chand.</SPEAKER>
<P>This I answer by distinguishing again; If you mean by being so recorded in holy Scripture, its being there in so many express words, then I deny your Consequence; but if you mean that it's not so by good consequence, I deny your <HI>Minor</HI> again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us not confound the people with so many Di|stinctions, but plainly deny what part you please <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>The Dr. now seems unwil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing again to al|low Scripture Conse|quence.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
</SP>

<P>I will make it appear, that there is that recorded in Scripture, which by just consequence will prove <HI>what you deny.</HI></P>

<P>If you can prove it so record|ed, 'tis enough. <NOTE N="&tridot;" PLACE="marg"><HI>Here</HI> Mr. Leigh <HI>was willing (tho the Respondent ought not to Prove) to offer Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">of for the peoples satisfaction.</HI></NOTE></P>

<P>This ought not to be put upon the Respondent. You must prove it still. Supposing that neither Mr. <HI>Chand|ler,</HI> nor Mr. <HI>Leigh,</HI> can give you an instance, you can't prove that none else can. If you can, we desire you would.</P>

<P>If Mr. <HI>Chandler</HI> can give an instance, why do you hinder him? I say it's an Universal Negative, and I de|mand only an instance to the contrary.</P>

<P>&mdash;I Suppose, Mr. <HI>Russel</HI> you must needs know, since you have been so often engaged in such work as this, that, according to all rules of Logick, you ought to prove the Negative.

<PB N="6" REF="24">
How do you prove this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> It lyes upon you to prove it. Otherwise we must suppose Mr. <HI>Russel</HI> is a confident man, and asserts what he cannot prove.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would take no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ice of one thing. Mr. <HI>Chandler</HI> hath preach'd to the People, That there is a plain com|mand for Infant Baptism in Scripture, and I argue upon him to give but one Instance, and you will not suffer him to do it.</P>

<P>It's not Mr. <HI>Chandlers</HI> Sermon, but the Questi|on, which we now argue upon.</P>

<P>I desire that the Persons here present would take notice, that however Mr. <HI>Chandler</HI> have asserted in this place, and very clearly proved the Baptism of Infants from the Commission of our <HI>Ld.

<P>Well, if that be the thing you deny, you deny the Conse|quence. And I prove it thus. If our Lord in the Commission which he hath given for Holy Baptism hath required h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s Disciples and Apostles, who were Men, to make those Dis|ciples by their Ministry who were to be Baptized, then my Consequence is true.

Disciples by their Ministry in your sense</HI>; I think here ought to be a distinction.

<P>Our Saviour hath joyn'd Discipling and Baptizing together. They are commanded first to make Disciples, and then to baptize them. Therefore, I say, if Infants are not capable of being made Disciples by the Ministry of men, they are not, according to this Commission, to be baptized.</P>

<P>Here you trick all this while. I told you, by Disciples I meant incompleat ones, and such as are given up in order to be instructed in the School of Christ. <HI>I re|quire you to prove that these ought not to be baptized, be|cause not capable of Instruction by the Ministry of Men.</HI></P>

<P>We are talking of the Prerequisites to Baptism: Therefore it's plain, according to what I have told you,
<PB N="10" REF="26">
and the Argument is express and full, according to the words of the Text, that they must be made Disciples by the ministry of men, if they be to be baptized: For in <HI>Mark</HI> Christ commissioneth <HI>to go into all the World, and preach the Gospel to every Creature.</HI> In <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. they were to Disciple all Nations, and then to baptize them.

<P>You industriously seek to hide your meaning. If you mean by Dis|ciples such as are so in the fullest and compleatest Sense, Prove that all must be made such, in order to their being baptized.

<P>If the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> did declare all the Councel of God, and kept back nothing that was profi|table for the Church of God, and yet did never declare the Baptism of infants to be an Institution of Christ, Then Infant Baptism is not according to the Commission of our Lord Jesus Christ.

<P>If the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> hath so declared it, then it's some where to be be found in the Writings of the new Testament. But it's no where to be found in the Writings of the New Testament. Therefore <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>I deny the consequence of your <HI>Major.

<P>You then acknowledge, that it's no where recorded in the New Testament.</P>

<SP>

<P>I deny that the Apostle did write the whole New Testament. And then, Would you confine what <HI>Paul</HI> is there said to have declared to the Church of <HI>Ephesus, To what is left on record, Viz,</HI> that particular. Epistle we find inscrib'd to them? He had spoken to the Church of <HI>Ephesus</HI> all the Councel of God, but we cannot suppose all that he deliver'd to them in 2 years to be contain'd with|in the compass of one short Epistle, containing but six Chapters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is all the Councel, that the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> wrote, in the New Testament? Is there any Commission for In|fant Baptism in the whole New Testament? Do you think you speak any thing to me?

He Declares, <HI>that his ways in Christ were such as he taught every where in every Church.</HI> I do not sup|pose that the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> taught one Doctrine at one place, and another at another. Now if he never taught this Doctrine to the Church of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> nor to none else, I hope that then you'll acknowledge (since it's not to be found in the Writings of the New Testament) that he never declared the Baptism of Infants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I utterly deny it, because in the Writings of the New Testament, are not all the Sermons that <HI>Paul</HI> Preached.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Rus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say this, if you'll declare before this People, that there is no Account that <HI>Paul</HI> did ever declare this in any of the Writings of the New Testament, It's suffici|ent; supposing the thing granted, that <HI>Pauls</HI> Epistles are not the whole of what he Preached.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rob.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's the Consequence you are now to prove. Because it's not left on record in his Epistle to the <HI>Ephe|sians,</HI> that therefore he never declared it to the Church of <HI>Ephesus.</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have neither <HI>Ephesus</HI> nor <HI>Pauls</HI> Epistles in my Arguments, yet you tell me.&mdash;<HI>Here was a general mur|muring at the Drs. evasions, the weakness whereof was ob|vious to the Auditory</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll beg a little silence. And first read what this Gentleman Quotes, (<HI>Acts</HI> 20.)&mdash;The Apostle tells the Church of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> he had not shunned to declare to them the whole Council of God. From hence he con|cludes, (<HI>Without Proof</HI>) <HI>that all that</HI> Paul <HI>had declared to them was written and left on record; and because the Bap|tism of Infants doth not stand on record, as being part of what he declar'd to the Church of</HI> Ephesus, <HI>therefore that he never did declare it. Remember.</HI> To the Church of <HI>Ephesus</HI> he speaks. Now of all the whole Councel of God, which he is said to have declared to them, there is but one Epistle containing six short Chapters left upon record. <HI>Can this short record contain all the Sermons that he Preached to them in two Years? Or dare any say, that he never declared to them the Baptism of Infants in two years Sermons and Discourses, because it's not contained in this short record</HI>? And so I have done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rus.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I have not done with you, the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> is the Person under consideration, and mention'd in my Argument, as one that did declare the whole Councel of God, and kept back nothing that was profitable for them. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Who doubts this, And what is it to the purpose?</HI></NOTE></P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rus.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Question under consi|deration and my Argument is of one that did declare the whole Councel of God. And that the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> did so, I prove, <HI>Acts</HI> 20.20. Compared, with <HI>v.</HI> 27. <HI>I have kept back nothing that was profitable for you, but have shewed

you and taught,</HI> &amp;c. Testifying to <HI>Iews</HI> and <HI>Greeks,</HI> &amp;c. v. 26.

I believe <HI>Paul</HI> was as faithful, as laborious a Servant and Steward of Jesus Christ, as ever Christ had in the World. And I argue. If <HI>Paul</HI> did never declare the Baptism of Infants to be a Gospel Institution, then, I tell you, there can be no such thing. The <HI>Major</HI> is proved from the Words of the Text. The other I prove by a Syllogism, that if he declare it, it is somewhere so recorded in the New Testament. But it is, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Remember he doth not mention any here to whom he had declared the Councel,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>but the</HI> Ephesians. <HI>He mentions</HI> Jews <HI>and</HI> Greeks, <HI>because there were</HI> Greeks <HI>or</HI> Hel|lenists <HI>at</HI> Ephesus, <HI>and many other places up and down, as well as</HI> Jews.</P>
<P><HI>And we don't Que|stion but he did declare the whole Councel,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and therefore Infant Baptism; but say it's not necessary to be left on record, as Preach't by</HI> Paul, <HI>especially to these</HI> Ephesians, <HI>when there is other good Scripture Proof for it.</HI></P>

<P>Because this is what Mr. <HI>Respondent</HI> puts upon you to prove, unless you prove that you prove nothing: That, tho' <HI>Paul</HI> did not shun to declare the whole Council of God; and did not declare Infant Baptism in his Epistle to the Church of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> therefore he did not declare it in his Sermons to them.</P>

<SPEAKER>Rus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I argue thus from this Commission. If there be an express command for the Baptizing some Persons in Christs Commission, and there be no express command, neither there nor elsewhere in the Holy Scriptures, for the Baptizing of Infants, then the Baptism of Infants is not contain'd in this Commission. But there is an express command, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Therefore,</P>

<SP>

<P>Pray observe it, whereas good Consequence was but now allowed with great difficulty, now it's deny'd. He requires an express command. To this I answer. If Nations do include Infants, then there is a plain com|mand.</P>

<P>It seems very strange, that you do deny this, and I will endeavour to prove it.

<P>Well, but as to the first thing; you argue from the Instance of the Eunuch; The Eunuch was a Prose|lyte of the Gate, and a grown person, and therefore <HI>Philip</HI> deals with him as such.

The in|stance of our Saviour doth not agree to such a case as this is. For that Christianity, as distinguished from <HI>Iu|daism,</HI> had not then a being, and the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> was not in this sense Christian, nor was baptism it self then instituted by our Lord; and therefore this instance can signify nothing to the case in hand.</P>

<P>If in this place it can neither signify the Laws and Promises of Gods Kingdom, nor the Graces by which we observe those Laws and Embrace those Promises, nor the Kingdom of Glory; then it must signify the Church-Militant here upon Earth.

<P>I was not driving them to Proof, but going to prove <HI>my Assertion</HI> by an Induction of Particulars, <HI>as I have already done</HI> and that I shall do again.</P>
<P>If the Kingdom of Heaven here signifys neither the Laws nor Promises of the Kingdom, nor Graces by which these Laws and Promises are observed and embra|ced, nor Jesus Christ's Management of his Kingdom, nor the Glory of Heaven, nor the Subjects of Glory, then it must signify the Church-Militant here upon Earth.

<P>I prove it by a Recapitulation of those Particulars. Of such little Children are the Laws and Promises of the Kingdom, of such are the Graces by which we observe and embrace them, of such is Christs Management of his Kingdom, of such is the Kingdom of Glory, of such is the Happiness or Subjects of Glory. <HI>Now is there any good sense in all this.</HI></P>

<P>By the Kingdom of Glory you must mean either the Happiness or Subjects of the Kingdom.

<P>This is very uncharitable, to exclude Infants from Heaven. I would rather incline to say, and I am sure the contrary to it <HI>Mr. Leigh</HI> can never prove, that all Infants belong to the Kingdom of Glory, than that none do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes we know your Judgment of that matter well enough. But you wilfully misrepresent my sense. I do not say that none who dy Infants go to the Kingdom of Glory, but that none are Infants when they come there. But the Text says, Of such is the Kingdom of Heaven. This therefore is what I assert, that it is absurd to say that
<PB N="38" REF="40">
the Kingdom of Glory is, in any part of it, made up of weak imperfect things as little Infants are; And there|fore that the Kingdom of Heaven, here spoken of, must mean the Church-Militant here on Earth which is in part made up of such,</P>

<P>My Answer is this.

They then told you; That such as were Mem|bers of the Church-Militant on Earth were to be Baptiz'd according to the Commission of our Lord. And this was the case of some Infants. You denyed any Infants were Members of Christs Kingdom, or Church-Militant here on Earth, and to prove this they brought that Text.

<P>They were not able to bear it. The Holy Ghost says so expresly; which signifys the Painfullness and Troublesomeness of that Ordinance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>What you say of moment is this. That Children are able to bear the Yoke of Circumcision, therefore that Yoke is not there intended, but the whole Ceremonial Law. We allow the Ceremonial Law was included, but Circumcision was here chiefly intended.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>If Circumcision was binding to keep the whole Law, then this is not the Yoke that neither we nor our fathers were able to bear. But it was so, <HI>Gal.</HI> 5.3.</P>

<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thus far I think the old Gentleman is in the right, that the Apostles are here and in the Epistle to the <HI>Gal.</HI> endeavouring the same thing, driving them off from the observation of the Ceremonial Law. But herein he is

mistaken, <HI>He would leave out Circumcision, one of the prime and most painful parts of this Law, and so would leave out those Infants whom th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">se Iudaizing Christians advised to be Circumcised.</HI></P>

<P>Prove that Infants are there intended.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>If the context do oblige us to take in Infants, then they are there intended. But the context, <HI>&amp;c.

<P>Here hath been a great deal of time spent about this Argument. The Substance of what was said on both sides is this: Mr. <HI>Chandler</HI> and Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> have urged, that such as are Disciples of Christ ought to be baptized, and that some Infants are Disciples of Christ. This Mr. <HI>Rus|sel</HI> deny's; and they have proved it from this, That some Infants are call'd Disciples by the Spirit of God. This also Mr. <HI>Russel</HI> hath deny'd; So that the whole Questi|on result's to this head: Whether any Infants be in Scrip|ture call'd Disciples? Now this hath been, I think, suffici|ently clear'd from this Text, <HI>Act.</HI> 15.10. where the Per|sons call'd Disciples are those, upon whom the Judaiz|ing Christians would have imposed the Yoke of Circumci|sion. The Doctrine, they taught the Christian Gentiles, was, That their Christianity would avail them nothing, It was to no purpose tho' they did Believe in Christ; un|less they were also Circumcised according to the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> they could not be saved. You all know what the Law of <HI>Moses</HI> doth prescribe and command in this case, not only, that they themselves, but that every Male Child among them should be Circumcised.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Russel,</HI> it's true; it's after the manner of <HI>Mo|ses</HI> in the First verse, but if you look forward into the Chapter, you will find express mention of the Law of <HI>Moses.</HI> You must be Circumcised and keep the Law of <HI>Moses. v. 5th.</HI> I suppose you that have so oft read this Chapter, could not but be sensible that such an Expressi|on was there, tho' not in the first verse; And therefore the distinction you will pretend to make between the Law of <HI>Moses</HI> and the Manner of <HI>Moses,</HI> was but a meer Evasion, and in this case a Distinction without Diffe|rence. The one explains the other. That which is call'd their being Circumcised after the manner of <HI>Moses,</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="44">
in one place, is called their being Circumcised and Keep|ing the Law of <HI>Moses</HI> in the other place. They must be Circumcised as <HI>Moses</HI> did order, so that his Law might be observed and fulfilled in the doing of it; which it could not be, tho they themselves were Circumcised never so regularly, unless their Infants were so too. And yet the whole Body of those on whom the Pharisees would have imposed the Yoke of Circumcision, are here ex|pressly call'd Disciples; This whole Body of Adult and Infants are therefore in common included under this Name, which was all that we had to prove. And we are now willing to refer it to the People, whether what hath been said be not sufficient Proof. If you please there|fore, we will now proceed to the Second question. Pray Mr. <HI>Chandler,</HI> let the Company understand what it is.</P>
<P><HI>Reader, Here observe. We were ready (as before men|tion'd) to offer several other Arguments, but no tollerable Answer being given to those two, neither the Rules of Dis|putation did oblige us, nor the Company's patience, and the approaching evening allow us to do it, unless the Second Question were wholly excluded.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Q.</HI> 2.</SPEAKER>

<P>Bring it into an Argument.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I put it into a <HI>Syllogism.</HI> I say, If the Holy Scrip|tures do shew us the right way of Baptizing, according
<PB N="47" REF="44">
to Christ's appointment, and yet do not shew us that sprinkling is the way of Baptizing, then Sprinkling is not the right way of Baptizing. But <HI>&amp;c</HI>: Therefore <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rob.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is not one word of Sprinkling in the Que|stion. It is, whether it be to be administred by Dip|ping, Plunging, Overwhelming, only.</P>
</SP>

<P>I argue thus then. If the Holy Scriptures &mdash;He goes on as before.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rus.</SPEAKER>
<P>What? Can't I begin to speak, but you must still be Interrupting me. I don't speak to you. I speak to Mr. <HI>Chand.</HI> If the Holy Scriptures shew us the right way of Baptizing and yet do not shew us that Sprink|ling.&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rob.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you would but observe order, you should have no Interruption from me. But you both must and shall conclude your Argument with the words of the Question, before Mr. <HI>Respondent</HI> shall take any notice of it.</P>

<P><HI>Must and shall Mr.</HI> Moderator?</P>

<P>Yes Mr. <HI>Russel</HI> you both must and shall. Other|wise it were fitter you should call me Mr. <HI>Cypher,</HI> then Mr. <HI>Moderator,</HI> if in this case I cannot <HI>Moderari.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rus.</SPEAKER>
<P>If chat Baptism which is appointed by Christ and doth properly set forth his Burial and Resurrection is the only right way of Baptizing, then it must be performed by Dipping, Plunging, Overwhelming only and not o|therways. But that baptism, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Is the only right way, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Therefore, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Chand.</SPEAKER>
<P>I first deny the Consequence of the Major. And then I deny the Minor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you do suppose, that it doth represent the Burial and Resurrection of Christ, yet it doth not thence follow, that this is the only right way of baptizing.</P>
<P>My Argument hath two parts which I shall prove. First, That it doth set forth the Burial and Resur|rection of Jesus Christ. Secondly, That therefore it is the only, right way of baptizing. First, It doth set forth the Burial and Resurrection of Jesus Christ, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.4. <HI>Col.</HI> 2.12. Buried with Christ in baptism, wherein also
<PB N="48" REF="45">
you are risen with him through the faith of the Opera|tion of God. And, I do say that, Buried with Christ in his Sepulchre we cannot possibly be, but the Apostle says, we are Buried with him in baptism, which doth properly represent the Burial and Resurrection of Christ, Now I proceed to the next, to shew that therefore it is the only right way. If there was no other baptism in|stituted by Christ, nor practised by the Apostles and first Ministers of the Gospel, but what doth represent the Bu|rial and Resurrection of Christ; Then Dipping only is the right way of baptizing. But, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Therefore, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Chand.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is not the Consequence of the Major. You are to prove that, because baptism is significant of the Burial and Resurrection of Christ; Therefore it must be by Dipping only.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Therefore I argue thus. If this was the only way practised in those times, then it must be by dipping only. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Reader. Observe, That the Dr. grounds his practice upon two Arguments link'd toge|ther,</HI> viz. <HI>The resem|blance between Dipping and a Burial. And Primitive Practice. Mr.</HI> Chandler, <HI>denies this resemblance between Dipping and Burial, to conclude for Dip|ping. And he ought to have proved that it doth; but instead there|of, he insists upon his second Argument drawn from Primitive pra|ctice. Hereupon there was no room (without contention) to urge any thing more against their first Argument. But you have it suffici|ently Answered in the brief Confutation.</HI></NOTE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Chand.</SPEAKER>
<P>I deny the Minor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rus.</SPEAKER>
<P>If there be any other way, then you or some other Person is able to shew it. But, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Chand.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can shew you another way&mdash;I can shew that the word signifies <HI>Washing,</HI> and there is great Probability that many had water poured on them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give an instance in the New Testament, that any was baptized any other way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>We argue upon a Probability, It might be <HI>otherwise than by Dip|ping; there is no necessity of Dipping.</HI> If you'll grant that, we will go upon somewhat else, <HI>viz. That it must be in our climate according to our way. But if not; you must prove that there is no Probability, that it might be done any other way than by Dipping.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us hear <HI>then what the Scripture says in this matter.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="49" REF="45">
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prove that those Texts where you render [baptism] by dipping, do truly and <HI>necessarily</HI> signify Dipping. Take what Text you will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I chuse that of our Saviour, <HI>Mar.</HI> 1.9. He was baptized of <HI>Iohn</HI> in <HI>Iordan. The Greek preposition is, <GAP DESC="foreign">. Into. And to say, he was washed of</HI> John <HI>into</HI> Jordan <HI>is not sense; therefore it ought to be render'd thus, He was dipped of</HI> John <HI>into</HI> Jordan.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>The preposition, <GAP DESC="foreign">, signifies [<HI>in</HI>] in the New Te|stament, as well as <HI>into</HI>; so here, he was baptized of <HI>Iohn</HI> in <HI>Iordan, is the true sense of the</HI> Greek.</P>
<P>Now we will allow thus far. That what was com|modious and usually practised <HI>on other occasions</HI> without any burthen, in that warm Country, might be observed in baptism. It is said, that all <HI>Iudea</HI> and the Country round came to <HI>Iohn</HI> and were baptized of him in <HI>Iordan.</HI> In those hot Countreys the custom was to go bare leg'd, in sandals. Now they might go into <HI>Iordan</HI> a little way, and then have water pour'd upon them; and if so, al|lowing that the Word <GAP DESC="foreign"> signifies <HI>to wash, They might be said in this manner to be washed in</HI> Jordan, <HI>without the least necessity of Dipping.</HI> I will offer it to the Com|pany whether this be not a fair interpretation of those words, <HI>Mar.</HI> 1.9. Christ came to <HI>Iohn</HI> and was baptized of him in <HI>Iordan,</HI> i.e. <HI>He went a step into the water, and was washed of him, in the manner aforesaid.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will not allow your signification of the word. I say the word, <GAP DESC="foreign"> signifies more than, <HI>In</HI>; So Christ is said to come into the world, <GAP DESC="foreign"> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Excellent</HI> Greek.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="foreign">, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.15. He went into the Sy|nagogue, <GAP DESC="foreign">: And so into <HI>Iordan,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign"> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg"><HI>Good</HI> Greek <HI>still.</HI></NOTE> <GAP DESC="foreign">. This doth imply, <HI>that he was Baptized or dipt into</HI> Jordan, <HI>as those other Texts, that he came into the Synagogue,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P>This Gentleman produceth three places where <GAP DESC="foreign"> signifys into, and I can produce three times three, where it cannot signify into, but must signify <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Here we were go|ing to read, but they gave no room.</HI></NOTE> In. The force of your Ar|gument lies upon <GAP DESC="foreign"> which you would have render'd Into, where it

signify's <HI>In.</HI> Then, <HI>add this to what</HI> I offer'd before, as a pro|bable Interpretation contrary to yours, it's evident that there's no necessity of Dipping, <HI>from this Text.</HI></P>

<P>There can be nothing beyond a probability assert|ed on our side or yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Well, prove that <GAP DESC="foreign"> signifys <HI>abluo, To wash frequently in Scripture.</HI> Thither we will go, That's our tale.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rus.</SPEAKER>
<P>According to all <HI>Lexicographers</HI> the primary sig|nification of the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> is, <HI>mergo, immergo,</HI> to Plunge, Overwhelm.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>But by the way, you prove your Practice from the Prime and Native Signification of the word. <HI>Suppose it were mergo, to Plunge, and not abluo, (which yet we deny)</HI> You cannot argue from the Native Signification of a word, <HI>with any force, when the Scripture acceptation of it is different.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did urge the Commission of our Saviour:</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Chand.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are to prove that Dipping is the only way. If the word will bear the sense of <HI>washing or</HI> pouring wa|ter, then dipping is not the only way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>You argue from the Prime and Native Significati|of the word. I'll appeal <HI>to the Learned. If this be a good way of arguing; Then the Mathematics must include all kind of Learning. Because it come's from</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>to learn. Then every Youth that is skill'd but a little in Phy|sicks, may be call'd a Physician, because it comes from</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">. <HI>Nay, and every Foot-boy, sent with a Letter, maybe called an Angel, because</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>signifies Messenger. To know therefore the sense of the word</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>in this ordinance, we must consider in what sense the word is usually taken in Scrip|ture. And to say it signify's to Dip, where the ordinance is mention<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, is plainly to beg the Question, to assert the thing without proof; Therefore, rightly to understand the sense of the word, we must have recourse to those places where the word is used, and the ordinance not intended.</HI> Now I re|quire one such place of Scripture where the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> signify's to dip <HI>necessarily.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rus.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>No there is no need of producing such a place.</HI> I shall prove it from the story of the <HI>Eunuch</HI> and <HI>Philip.</HI> He commanded the Chariot to stand still, and they both

went down into the water, and then, when he had put him under water, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>The Text</HI> Ac. 8, 38. <HI>hath not a word of putting him under the water.</HI></NOTE> they both came out of the water.</P>

<SP>

<P>The <HI>Assembly,</HI> The Continuators of <HI>Pool, Calvin,</HI> Dr. <HI>Hammond</HI> allow it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>That's nothign to us. I defye you to prove that the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> in any Text of Scripture signify's to dip.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Rus.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then? You deny what Dr. <HI>Hammond,</HI> the <HI>Assembly,</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> Annotations have said.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>We cannot say they have said so. We have not their Books at hand to turn to. Besides, suppose they should, that's no Proof. <HI>We are no Papists, to pin our faith on other Mens Sleeves.</HI></P>
<P>In the next place. Whereas Mr. <HI>Russel</HI> hath brought the passage of <HI>Philip</HI> and the <HI>Eunuch,</HI> That they went down into the water and came up out of the water. It might as well be render'd, They went to and came from the water <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>So the</HI> Greek <HI>Pre|positions often signify.</HI></NOTE>. Now if they came by a River's side, they might go down out of a Chariot to the water, and when the <HI>Eunuch</HI> was Baptized, they came up from the water. Is not this a fair sense of these words? They went to and came from the wa|ter <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Where is dip|ping to be found in this Text?</HI></NOTE>. Again if you argue from the word <GAP DESC="foreign">, I can tell you of Se|ven Places, where the word is used and not applyed to the ordinance, And you cannot prove that it signify's to dip in any of them. <HI>I argue then.</HI> If there are several Texts of Scripture, where the word cannot possibly bear this sense; Then it doth not necessa|rily bear it.

<P>I prove it by some Instances; <HI>Mark.</HI> 7.4. Except

they wash, they eat not: <GAP DESC="foreign"> except they be Baptized. But can it be imagined that they were plun|ged over head and ears every time they went to meals?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>The word is sometimes render'd <HI>dipping</HI> in our <HI>English</HI> Translation, as, He that dippeth with me in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>The word is there <GAP DESC="foreign">, not <GAP DESC="foreign">; besides, this would avail your cause but little, for can you sup|pose that he dip't himself over head and ears in the dish?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find the word to signify no more then <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Mark.</HI> 7.4, 5. And so <HI>Naaman</HI> is said to observe the Prophets word, which was <GAP DESC="foreign">, yet he went, and; as we read, dipped. Now since he observed the command of the Prophet, it is plain that <GAP DESC="foreign"> doth not necessarily signify any thing but washing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rus.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is the word in the <HI>Hebrew</HI>?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Chan.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are two words, <GAP DESC="foreign"> and <GAP DESC="foreign">: And the Prophet commanded him, <GAP DESC="foreign">; and it is added, ac|cording to the word of the Prophet, <GAP DESC="foreign">, where it is plain the words are used promiscuously; and <GAP DESC="foreign"> signi|fies no more than <GAP DESC="foreign">. So also we may observe, Christ commanded the blind man to wash in the Pool of <HI>Silo|am.</HI> Must it be said, that he was dipt there? or can it be proved that <HI>Naaman</HI> was dipt, because <GAP DESC="foreign">. <HI>Nay,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>is so far from always signifying to dip, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>it self, tho <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> in this sense, yet sometimes signifies only to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">.

<SP>

<P>What wash Beds, or Tables, by Dipping them under Water? Or must it be by pouring Water on them <HI>&amp;c.</HI>? Upon the whole, the Application of a little Water in Baptism, especially in these Cold Climates, is ground|ed upon what Christ quotes. I will have Mercy and not Sacrifice. Now it being not Necessarily implyed <HI>in Scrip|ture</HI> that Dipping was the ancient Practice, we say, that having a fair and probable way deducible from Scripture, <HI>we must rest therein,</HI> having recourse to that general rule. <HI>Davids</HI> hunger was a fair excuse for eating the shew|bread, which is call'd Most Holy, <HI>and Lawful only for the Priests to Eat.</HI> Therefore, if Dipping in Cold Weather, and Cold Climates, do tend to the Prejudice of a Person's Health, <HI>yea to Endanger Life, and it be not certainly

fixt in Scripture, as the only way of Administring the Ordi|nance, we may use our own may, as, in General, most agree|able to the word of God.</HI></P>

We pay a just defe|rence to the very worthy names you mention'd, but we cannot think our selves obliged to believe every thing they say. If you have any Solid Reasons to offer, or the clear evidence of any Text of Scripture, to deter|mine this point, pray let us hear it before we close up the day. Nothing being said, he, applying himself to the People, added.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rob.</SPEAKER>
<P>A great deal of loose discourse you have heard, upon this last Question. Mr. <HI>Russel</HI> was obliged by all the Laws of Disputation, to prove, that according to the Commission of our Lord, Baptism was to be administred by Dipping, Plunging, Overwhelming, and no otherwise. Some attempts he made towards it, of the weakness of
<PB N="55" REF="48">
which, I doubt not but, you are all sensible; And there|fore (which yet they were not obliged to) Mr. <HI>Chandler</HI> and Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> undertook to prove that it was not Necessarily to be so Administred. For the clearing of which, they have manifested that the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> in the <HI>Greek</HI> as well as <GAP DESC="foreign"> in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> doth not, necessarily, sig|nify any thing more than only to Wash, or, to apply water to a Person, without determining whether it shall be by dipping a Person into water, or pouring water up|on him, or any other way; so that water be applyed, it is all that can necessarily be concluded from the words. Of this they have given clear evidence both from the Old Testament and the New.</P>
<P>And now upon the whole, we are willing to refer it to your own Judgments, whether you will be perswaded to account your own Baptism a Nullity, because it hath not been administred in the way of these Persons. If you can without any Solid Reason, or without so much as the evidence of one single Text of Scripture, be Satisfyed, you may then take what our adversaries have said for Satisfaction. But, since it hath been fully proved, that Christ hath only required that Persons be Solemnly en|tred into his Church by Baptizing or Washing them in the Name of Father, Son and Spirit, and hath not determi|ned, so far as doth appear, whether this washing shall be performed this way or that, we are willing, I say, to refer it to the Judgment of you all, whether our way of Admi|stration be not the most commodious:</P>

<HEAD>Some Iust Reflections on Dr. <HI>Russel</HI>'s pre|tended Narrative.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS with great Regret, that we are again diverted from more p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">easing and useful Studies, to dip our Pens in this Watry Controversy, and undertake this Invidious Service. As we were Necessitated by the Anabaptists Challenge to the Disputation it self, so had they not (by Publishing a false account,) laid us under a like Necessity to Vindicate the Truth and our selves, the World had never more heard of this matter. In these our Reflections, we shall Manifest the Author's Egregious Falshood, in some parts of his Narrative, his Trisling Impertinencys in others, and the Uncharitable Principles that have drop'd from him.</P>
<P>The Narrative is pretended to be Transcrib'd from Mr. <HI>Bissel</HI>'s and Mr. <HI>Ring</HI>'s Copy's. Now we can assure the World, that Mr. <HI>Bissel</HI>'s Copy was like a Lawyer's Breviate, containing only hints for Memory, and may be all contain'd in 3 or 4 pages, and hardly one word of it in this Narrative. As to Mr. <HI>Ring</HI>'s, we have taken the pains to compare it with this account, and find several hundred Falshoods, Additions, Alterations and O|missions. It is an ill omen thus to stumble at the Threshold; and what begins with a Falshood, we have Reason enough to Mi|strust. But to the Narrative it self, we shall (as to some parts) shew it's Egregious Falshood as to matters of fact, and that by its Omissions of some, and misciting other particulars, as well as positive false assertions.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is Egregiously false by Reason of its Omissions. Not that eve|ry Omission of a word or Sentence, (perhaps) would have ren|der'd it so; but such Omissions as alter the very State of the Dis|putation, and make it look like an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ther thing, than it truly was, are undoubtedly to be call'd Falshoods. Should any one pretend|ing
<PB N="57" REF="49">
to report the Psalmists Sense, <HI>Ps.</HI> 14.1. leave out the first words, and assure the world he said, <HI>there is no God</HI>; would not this be call'd a Notorious Falshood? tho the Falseness of it lies, in not relating the whole Sentence. From whence it may be collected, That it is not only asserting what was never said, but also the Omission of something that was said, may bring an Hi|storian under the Guilt of Falsifying. And whether it be not so in the present case, we shall leave the World to judge, in these few Instances.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Leigh,</HI> upon their frequent pressing for an Instance from Scripture, of our Practice in Baptizing Infants, happily retort|ed the Argument upon themselves, and challeng'd them to pro|duce one Instance of their Practice, as theirs differs from ours. For all that know us, know we also baptize such as are adult, up|on the Profession of the Christian Faith, that were not baptiz'd in Infancy: Nay, that we should refuse to baptize the Child of an Heathen, or other Notorious Infidel, (unless adopted by some Christian) till he become adult, and make a credible Profession of Christianity. Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> therefore press'd them for one Scrip|ture Instance of a believing, meaning a Christian Parents Child, whose Baptism was delay'd till adult. And withal, told them, That from the Death of Christ to the Death of St. <HI>Iohn,</HI> accor|ding to the computation of the Learned, was about 60 years, in which compass of Time, multitudes of Christians Children were become adult. Dr. <HI>Russel</HI> mention'd <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great as a Scripture-Instance, which was justly ridicul'd: Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> as he acknowledg'd to us afterwards, thought it not of any Force, and by the intimation of his Son, alledges the Instance of our Lord, as born of a Believer, of the Virgin <HI>Mary.</HI> To which Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> reply'd, <HI>I thought we had been speaking of the Commissi|on; now this was before the Commission.</HI> Intimating, that the In|stance was not pertinent, relating to a Baptism that preceeded the Commission of our Lord; and therefore our Disputation was no way concern'd in it. Notwithstanding this, Dr. <HI>Russel</HI> would have it a pertinent Answer, Christ being the Child of a Believer. And to this he reports no Answer, but makes Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> seek to be Opponent upon it, as if confounded with this Instance, <HI>pag.</HI> 35. Whereas, immediately upon the Reply of Dr. <HI>Russel,</HI> Mr. <HI>Robinson,</HI> our Moderator, adds, <HI>Tho Mr.</HI> Leigh <HI>express'd himself in so general Terms, yet the whole strain of the Discourse did suffici|ently manifest that an Instance of the Child of a Believer, properly Christian, was call'd for: Now the Virgin</HI> Mary <HI>was a Iew, and not then a Christian: Nor was Christian Baptism then instituted.</HI> With more to the same purpose. Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> also further reply|ed, <HI>That Christ was not to be imita<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed in that, because then no Person:
<PB N="58" REF="50">
ought to be baptized till</HI> 30; <HI>not except circumcis'd at</HI> 8 <HI>days old,</HI> as the Reader may set in the foregoing Narrative. After which Dr. <HI>Russel</HI> offer'd nothing. Now we appeal to all the World, whether when so large and distinct a Reply was made, both by Mr. <HI>Robinson</HI> and Mr. <HI>Leigh,</HI> this man hath fairly represented our Cause, when he takes no notice at all of it. But if this Gentleman, or any of his Friends, can yet produce one Scrip|ture-Instance of the Child of a Christian Parent, baptiz'd at grown years, it will be somewhat to the purpose; and they may ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e the confidence to call for Instances from us, and to pretend that theirs (as distinguish'd from ours) is the Scripture-way, and most agreeable to the Commission of our Lord: But till then how unreasonable is it for them to expect Instances of our way, when they have none to produce for their own?</P>
<P>Again he hath omitted to tell the World, (what all that were present well Remember,) that he was put to Silence by what was urg'd from <HI>Mat.</HI> 19.14. to prove Infant Members of the Church-Militant upon Earth. Insomuch that after a long Silence, Mr. <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">binson</HI> call'd to him, and ask'd if he had no reply to make and beg'd of him that if he had any thing to say he would speak; otherwise tell the People that we might proceed. To which Dr. <HI>Russel</HI> made a very weak reply&punc; that in this Text there is not a word of Baptism, or the Commission; and Mr. <HI>W.</HI> instead of Answering took the Oppenancy, as in the Narrative. But not one word more from that Argument could be got from Dr. <HI>Russel.</HI></P>
<P>Besides tho' he hath conceal'd yet he cannot (himself) ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> forgotten, that the <HI>2d.</HI> Argument on our pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, where he was again Silence<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was sum'd up by Mr. <HI>Robinson</HI> in the words o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> our Na|rative: Then we refer'd i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the Gentlemen present, whether we should offer any more Argument on the <HI>1st</HI> Question, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> was thought wholly needless. Mr. <HI>Robinsons</HI> closing Speech on the <HI>2d.</HI> Question, is also whol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y omitted.</P>
<P>We forbear to mention here, how he hath omitted such passa|ges as did sufficiently expose his Ignorance to the Learned part of the company: Such a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> were his telling us once and again, that <GAP DESC="foreign"> was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f the Masculine Gender, agreeing with <GAP DESC="foreign"> when <HI>Greek</HI> Verbs admit not of Genders, tho' <HI>Hebrew</HI> do; and his saying <GAP DESC="foreign"> as if it had been with an <HI>Omega</HI> and <HI>I Consonant.</HI> So <GAP DESC="foreign">. Faults for which a School Boy would deserve the lash.</P>
<P>And when he was not allow'd to conclude his first Argument&punc; on the <HI>2d.</HI> Question, otherwise than with the word of the Que|stion, it will be Remember'd (tho' his Narrative hath not told us,) with how great difficulty he form'd his <HI>Syliegism,</HI>
<PB N="59" REF="50">
and how many attempts he made before he could bring the words of the Question, into the conclusion: Insomuch that our Moderator offer'd him his Assistance.</P>
<P>These and several other particulars which quite a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ter the Face of the Disputation, were by no means to be omitted: Nei|ther can that be call'd a True Narrative, that suppresseth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he Truth in such Instances as these.</P>
<P N="2">2. This Narrative is false, in regard of its strange misplacing some Particulars: on which account the Reader can form no true Idea of the Disputation. So, for instance, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ays concerning <GAP DESC="foreign">, and <GAP DESC="foreign"> page 34. (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> is true) should have come in in the midst of Mr <HI>William</HI>'s ram|bling Discourse, betwixt Dr. <HI>Russel</HI>'s 4th and 5th Arguments; and that about the <HI>Beasts of the Field,</HI> should have had its place betwixt the 1st and 2d Argument on our part for <HI>Infant Baptism</HI>; when Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> and <HI>Russel</HI> were both Rambling again. And had they been found in their proper places, as in Mr. <HI>Ring</HI>'s Co|py, which <HI>Narrative Russel</HI> pretends to transcribe, they would only have serv'd to expose the Weakness of him that brought them. But as he hath plac'd them here, they serve to hide the shameful Baffle they and their Cause had by the Arguments on our side. For, as was said before, they never re-assum'd the Opponency on the fi
rst Question, after the closing up the Argu|ment from Infants Discipleship. Tho Dr. <HI>Russel</HI> brings in these Two Arguments, as if they went off with Triumph, to the 2d Question. Which yet every Judicious Auditor Knows to be False. Lesser slips we pass by.</P>
<P N="3">3. He hath forg'd several downright Falshoods; one of which is just under our Eye, with relation to what is immdiately be|fore said, and therefore (tho a little out of its place <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> men|tion it here. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> tells the World, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> said, <HI>they might take up the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ponency again, if they pleas'd:</HI> And again, <HI>that be re-assum'd the Opponen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y again, at Mr.</HI> Leigh'<HI>s Reque<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t of which h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was sick.</HI> With much of the same sort, page 34. Which is the meer Figment of his own Brain, and not one Sy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">able of it True. The Omission of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> things that were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aid, tho' it alter the Face of the Disputation, might be Impu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d to a weak Imperfect Copy: But this must nee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s be a Contriv'd and Deli|berate Falshood; nor hath he a right to be Believ'd in any thing, that dare Forge and Publish such an untruth.</P>
<P>But because the Preface is almost one continued Falshood, we shall particularly take notice of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. He declares Mr. <HI>Bows</HI> and Mr. <HI>Webber</HI> were the sole cause of his being Engag'd in the Disputation, whereas Mr. <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">b|ber</HI> hath declar'd to Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> and <HI>Mr. Chandler,</HI> that he utter|ly,
<PB N="60" REF="51">
disliked the dispute from the Beginning, and was only thus far concern'd; seeing they would Engage he advis'd rather to Dr. <HI>Russel</HI> than <HI>Mathew Cassin,</HI> whom Mr. <HI>Bows</HI> had pitch'd upon. A Man that denys both the Deity and Humanity of Christ, against whom Dr. <HI>Russel</HI> hath Printed an Honest Pro|testation. And this Man tho' overturning the Fundamentals of Christianity is hugg'd by Mr. <HI>Bows</HI>: Because he agrees with him, in the darling Notions of Believers Baptism by dipping; Which, he told the Worshipful the <HI>Mayor</HI> of <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> was a Fundamental of Religion. Thus uncharitably doth this Man shut us all out of Heaven, and confine Religion to his own par|ty, while a denyer of Christs Deity and Humanity hath been since, as well as before the Disputation, admitted into his Pul|pit, while he, as a Messenger of the Churches, was travelling busily to spread false Reports against us.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another falshood which is indeed from the wrong Infor|mation of Mr. <HI>Leddell,</HI> (that Man of heat, which much Water cannot Quench,) is this; that he should twice go to Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> to compare Copys and he refus'd to do so, altho' his Copy, was then finish'd. This is a downright falshood as appears by the annexed Testimonial.</P>

<P>To convince the World of the falseness of what is said in the 2 Page of the first leaf of Dr. <HI>Russel's</HI> Dedication, with Respect to my self; I do declare, that Mr. William <HI>Leddel</HI> never came to me but once, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he ask'd me whether I had Transcrib'd what I wrote at the Disputation I told him I had not, but intended to do it.

<P N="3">3. It is false that Mr. <HI>Chandlers</HI> Sermons were the occasion of the Dispute, and much more, that this is agreed to by us. As he asserts pr. pag. 2. We are all of Opinion, Mr. <HI>Bow's</HI> Impu|dent cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng was the occasion of it, tho' Mr. <HI>Chandlers</HI> Ser|mons were the innocent occasion of that challenge. So that ac|cording to the Proverb, he might as well have said Tenterden Steeple was the cause of <HI>Goodwin</HI> Sands.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is false that it lay upon us to prove our Practice, when in the Preliminary<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they that made the challenge undertook to be Asserters, and Dr. <HI>Russel</HI> took the Opponency upon him|self: He hath also abus'd Dr. <HI>Smith,</HI> who told him as he was Assertor he must prove, but <HI>Negantis non est probare.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. It is false that as he says pr. pag. 8. Mr. <HI>Robinson</HI> should in the midst of the dispute give him the lye, and yet could not make any thing out about it. This sentence contains as many Falshoods as can possibly be crowded into so narrow a com|pass. That Mr. <HI>Robinson</HI> speaks with a loud voice, is what all that know him, know to be false. Yet this Gentleman ven|tures to say pag. 13. he bawl'd very loud; again pag. 35. Mr <HI>Robinson</HI> stood up, made a noise like one in a Delirious Pa|roxysm. What doth the Man mean to Write at such a rate as this? Surely he thinks loud lies will do no hurt.</P>
<P>And that Mr. <HI>Robinson</HI> ever did in the Disputation give him the lye, (as far as can by himself or Freinds be Recollected, or be made appear by any Copys then taken) is wholly untrue; and 'tis strange (if this Dignify'd <HI>Dr.</HI> So well Remember it) that he could find no place for it in his Narrative; that so the Circum|stances that attended it, might have assisted our Memories.</P>
<P>Yet (that we may not wrong him,) Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> owns the words as his: That without a Complement it was a lie in him, to insinuate to the People, as if Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> would have all In|fants excluded from Heaven.</P>
<P>Besides he intimates, upon giving him the lie, there was a challenge made to the party to prove it, and yet he could make nothing out about it. Whereas there was never any such challenge given, and we are ready to prove to his Face, that in the Disputation it self he told more lies than one; tho' he should not have had that coarse Complement from any of
<PB N="62" REF="52">
us, Had he but behav'd himself like a Scholar or a Gentleman&punc;</P>
<P N="6">6. It is false that Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> said that Mr. <HI>Ro|binson</HI> exceede<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the bounds of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> or abus'd Dr. <HI>Russel</HI> in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> whole that Mr. <HI>Francis Willia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> said was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>Iohn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iliiams</HI> com|plain'd that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, he reply'd; if he did so, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> But, as to Mr. <HI>Robinson's</HI> abusing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> never said or thought any such thing. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> said under this head, but th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> unexpected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d Mr <HI>Iohn Williams,</HI> restrained our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> God he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> gone to give his account, and we shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> is grave.</P>

<P><Q>I Solemnly appeal to the great God, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">est knows what were my words, that to the best of my Remembrance, I spake to Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> after this manner. Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> I must tell you, and that not as mine own Sentiment only, but (I Believe I may speak it,) as the Sentiments of the rest of my Brethren, that whatever Credit (not your cause) but ye may have gain'd, is wholly owing unto you.

<P>This we are well assur'd Dr. <HI>Russel</HI> knew, as being told so, by some of Mr. <HI>Chandlers</HI> Friends at the <HI>Coffee-House</HI> in <HI>Alderjgate|street</HI>: when he gave the Honourable Lieutenant Governour such Scurrilous Names, as we will not foul our Paper with. Notwithstanding this, this Man hath the Impudence, to dedi|cate his false Narrative to him; Indeed with a Diminutive Title as if he were not Lieutenant Governour, Receiving an Imme|diate Commission from the King, but only deputy Govenour, deputed by <HI>Major</HI> General <HI>Earl.</HI></P>
<P>This he should have enquir'd into, before he had dedicated his Book to him. This Noble Gentleman is aspers'd and ridi|cul'd as one of our unthinking admirers Nar. pag, 7. and a squirter out of Poolish Advertisements, words that need no other Invective than the Bare Relation, Pag. 10. what he adds further, that we would not give him the Civil Title of <HI>Dr.</HI> that he took his degree at <HI>Cambridg,</HI> admitted as a Member of that
<PB N="64" REF="53">
Honourable Senate, and that not <HI>Ex gratia</HI>; is partly false. That he was created a <HI>Mandamus Dr.</HI> by <HI>King Iames</HI> in 1688. we understand, and with how great a Price this Tool bought that priviledg, we leave the World to Jndg. But what he means by a Senate at <HI>Cambridg,</HI> is beyond our understanding. That he was not regularly chosen as one well furnish'd with the Learned Qualifications requir'd, his Ignorance in <HI>Greek</HI> we think to be a sufficient Evidence. We could also inform him to whom he apply'd himself for the better understanding of the Latine Tongue. That he also kept a <HI>Coffee-House</HI> in <HI>Bartholomew-Close,</HI> is well known to the Neighbourhood there. But supposing he he had been a Regular <HI>Dr.</HI> in Physic, as he stiles himself, this may no more qualify him for a Divinity Disputation than be|ing a Coffeeman. So that why he should insist on his Title, in this case, we know not.</P>
<P>Here we shall also take notice of another Falshood, that this bold Gentleman hath Publish'd amongst and by his Friends in <HI>London.</HI> Tho' he have not adventur'd it into his Narrative; one of us hath been assur'd by a Person that had it, from the Mouth of an Anabaptist of considerable note in <HI>London,</HI> that <HI>Dr. Russel,</HI> to put it out of doubt, that he and his Friends had carry'd the day at <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> added, the Bishop of <HI>Salisbury</HI> had received a Letter from <HI>Colonel Gibson,</HI> wherein he applauded their <HI>i. e.</HI> the Anabaptist's performance. That such a report hath spread abroad we are well assur'd. But that it is most Egregiously false, that Right Reverend Person whose name he hath made use of, hath given us leave to assure the World&punc; He doth indeed own he had a Letter from <HI>Colonel Gibson,</HI> his near Kinsman, Relating to the Disputation. But to a purpose quite opposite to what this falsiefier reports; and adds, that not only the Letter he Receiv'd, but one directed to the <HI>Ld. A. Bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> of <HI>Casterbury,</HI> did Represent the disputation as much to our ad|vantage as could be desir'd.</P>
<P>To this sense his Lordship was pleas'd to express himself to Mr. <HI>Robinson</HI> our Moderator, (who waited on him on this oc|casion) and Generously allow'd us to make use of his Name, for the undeceiving the World in this matter.</P>
<P N="9">9. It is false, what he intimates pr. pag. 11. that when we were pinch'd upon an Argument, we made a Noise and Cla|mour that hindred the People from hearing what was said. Whereas all that were present, we doubt not, well Remember, the first disturbance we had of that kind, was that mention'd in the Narrative, pag. 35. when the Anabaptists (upon the mention of our Saviour, as an Instance of the Child of a Be|liever, not Baptiz'd till adult) rudely enough set up a shout.
<PB N="65" REF="53">
And Mr. <HI>Webber</HI> Ignorantly cry'd, 'Tis done! 'Tis done! Tho' the Triumph was but short liv'd, for so soon as Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> reply'd to the Instance, the Body of the People return'd 'em their Civility, and set up another shout at them. Besides which, there was no further Noise or Interruption of that Nature, till that rude Comparison of Children and Beasts of the Feild, of which more afterwards. The last Interruption was when <HI>Russel</HI> would have put us off with a bundle of Humane Testimonys, instead of proof, and we had once and again protested against them, and given our Reasons <HI>viz.</HI> that we had not the Authors at hand, to try the truth of his Quotations; besides that should they have said what he would have them, their Testimo|ny would not necessarily Engage our assent, they being but fallible men. When after this he yet would trouble us with his Impertinent long Quotations, the People refus'd to hear him, and continu'd to hiss till he gave over reading; but what was said at the closing up of that head by us, doth suffi|ciently Manifest no Human Testimony can pinch us: It was the Ridiculous weakness and not the force of the Argument couch'd in his Testimonies that occasion'd that noise. And if there was any thing in it, that was a grievance to him; Let him thank his Anabaptist Friends that gave the first Example.</P>
<P N="10">10. It is false, that Mr. <HI>Fox</HI> was dip'd by Mr. <HI>Williams</HI>'s ad|vice, Who was not then in the Country, nor did Mr. <HI>Earle</HI> know him. That it was done by Mr. <HI>Chandlers</HI> advice, is also false; for he was then at <HI>London.</HI> But that none of us would refuse to dip a Person in such a case, is true. We never pleaded against dipping as one way, but as the only way; not against 'its Lawfulness, but Necessity. So that this Instance is brought in to no purpose; and Brother <HI>Duke</HI> should have inform'd him|self better in the Circumstances of this story, before he had con|vey'd it to <HI>London.</HI> Nay he was dip'd not at <HI>Gosport</HI> but <HI>Ha|vant.</HI></P>
<P>We shall purposely wave the Falshoods in the Narrative it self, because our own account doth sufficiently manifest them. We shall only add that the Conclusion of the Book is as false as the rest. For he says <HI>p.</HI> 59, 60. <HI>That God was pleas'd to make the hearing of the dispute, of such use to several Persons; That they were fully convinc'd &mdash; and did in few days after, submit them|selves to 'be dip'd in Water</HI>; whereas we can hear of no unpre|judiced Persons, Who were any way inclin'd towards Anabap|tism, by any thing that was offer'd in the Disputation. And we challenge them to Name us one Person so convinc'd. Those that were fix'd in their Prejudices, might perhaps take their weak Arguments and Trifling Answers for a sufficient Confutation,
<PB N="66" REF="54">
of Infant Baptism: But we provoke them to Name one unpre|judic'd Person that did so. And do offer, for one such Person so na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">'d by them, We will, if they demand it, tell them the Names of several who did strongly incline to Anabaptism before, who by that Disputation were set right and fully satisfy'd, that the Anabaptist cause sloth rest on weak Unscriptural Principles, how loudly soever they pretend to Scripture.</P>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>HAving thus far manifested, how little Regard the Ana|baptist <HI>Dr.</HI> had to Truth in his Narrative, this were enough to be offer'd by way of reply; nor need there any thing more to discredit an History, than to shew that it is false. But we shall so far condescend to the weakness of Injudicious Persons; as to animadvert also on the Trifling Impertinencies, his Narra|tive abounds with.</P>
<P N="1">1. All the Arguments they offer'd were Trifling Cavils. The First was design'd to turn off the Opponency upon us. The 2<HI>d</HI> supposes what was never granted them, that the only Com|mission and universal directory for Baptism is contain'd in <HI>Mat.</HI> 28.19. <HI>Mar.</HI> 16.16. For indeed if this were Christs only Com|mission. then his Disciples did Baptize <HI>Ioh.</HI> 4.2. without his Commission; for this Command was not then deliver'd: again, if th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s Command were design'd as an universal directory, Then previous Examination, discourses of the Significancy and Obligation of this Sacrament, stated Prayer before and after, are besides the Commission. Nay, the Apostles did deviate, from the Commission, when they Baptiz'd only in the Name of the Lord Jesus or of the Lord, <HI>Acts</HI> 10. <HI>Vlt.</HI> 19.5. this is therefore no other than extending the Commission to the Gentile World; supposing that the Practice of it both as to manner and Subjects was well known before, only then
 con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed to the lost sheep of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of <HI>Is<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">el.</HI> So that Infants may be Baptiz'd if we can bring good proof for it out of the other parts of Holy Writ, tho it could not be prey'd from Christ's Command: For the whole Scripture is the will of Christ; and his will discern'd in this Matter, is his Commission. But supposing (not gran|ting) this to be an universal directory, We distinguish'd be+tween Disciples, that are compleat or Incompleat. Incom|pleat may be made by the Ministry of Men.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="67" REF="54">1. As by the Preaching of Men, Parents may be converted and constrain'd to give up all they have and are to God, and so their Infants thus consider'd in their Parents, they are remotely made Disciples by the Ministry of Men.</P>
<P N="2">2. They are immediately made Disciples by the Ministry of Men; by the Parents devoting them to God; and bringing them to his Ministers to be solemnly dedicated to him. <HI>Dr. Russel</HI>'s vain attempts to take off this distinction, may be taken notice of in the foregoing Narrative, to which we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er the reader, as also to observe the little Arguments they further us'd, and weak Answers they gave to our Arguments.</P>
<P N="2">2. His Reflections in the time of the Disputation it self and what he hath added, are equally Trifling and Insignificant. For Instance.</P>
<P N="1">1. What he insinuates p. 6. as if in effect we gave away our cause, because we refus'd (at that time) to give an Instance, where there was any thing recorded in Scripture, that did ob|lige us to Baptize Infants, whereas it then lay on them to prove the contrary: Our business (who were the Respondents) was to attend their proof, the time was not yet come for us to produce our own. It was agreed that they who had reflected on the Doctrine of Infant Baptism as false and wholly untrue; should prove that it was so. Yet this Trifler when he had undertaken to prove, that Infants are not the Subjects of Baptism, At the very first would have put it upon us to prove they were so, and would perswade the company we gave away our cause, unless we did as he directed. This was Doctor like Truly! And one would not grudge, (however he came by it) to give him the Title, who does so powerfully carry all before him. You have his whole sense in these few words. Gentlemen, if I prove that Infants are not the Sublects
 of Baptism, you will allow I perform what I have undertaken, pag. 5. now this I'll make so plain, you shall not be able to answer or evade the force of my Argument. Thus I argue; if they be the Subjects of Baptism, Mr. <HI>Leigh,</HI> Mr. <HI>Chandler</HI> or some Body else is able to prove it. But therefore they are not so: And now I have effectually done your business; for if you say you can prove it, let's hear it; if not, you give away your cause. To this sense doth this mighty Man of Logic Flourish at the entrance, and Wonderful Feats no doubt he thinks he hath done in it: But such Egregious Trifling is hardly found among any pretending to the least degree above common sense. And it was fitter to have been hiss'd out, than so soberly reply'd to as it was.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="68" REF="55">1. What! Do you prove that Infants are not the Subjects of Baptism, by putting us to prove that they are. Wonderful! this 'tis to be a <HI>Dr.</HI> and to know more than all the World besides.</P>
<P>For till this <HI>Dr.</HI> came upon the stage, these 2 things were always very differing (to make proof of a thing, and put ano|ther to prove the contrary.) This Gentleman undertook to prove p. 5. but (as if he repented of his rash undertaking) he very courteously invites us to change sides with him, and there|by free him of a burthen that was too heavy for him.</P>
<P N="2">2. Nor is every thing untrue, the contrary to which we can|not prove true. We cannot prove that this Narrative, <HI>Russel</HI> e|ver was at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> or took his Degrees there; but would he have us therefore take the contrary for certain Truth? Yes, we must, according to his method. If one boldly assert against us, That he never was at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> we desire they would prove it before we give Credit to 'em. In his way they'll prove it too, and then we must needs grant it. Well, we wait only for the Proof. Thus it is. You cannot prove that he ever was at <HI>Cam|bridge,</HI> or took any Degree there. Therefore, behold, he was not. The strange Effects of Logick!</P>
<P N="3">3. Nor if we can prove it, doth it follow we needs must? es|pecially when he had undertaken the Opponency. We that stood upon our Defence (as Respondents) were only to attend to what they had to offer, and show the invalidity of it; but were by no Laws of Disputation, that ever yet were publish'd to the World, oblig'd to change sides with them and take the proving part on us. Tho' this we declare we were ready to do in due time but it was no way fit to be done at the beginning of the Disputation, unless this Doughty <HI>Dr.</HI> had said in plain words (as he did in effect in his first Argument,) Gentlemen, I have undertaken more than I can do. And therefore tho' I cannot prove that Infants are not the Subjects of Baptism, I should take it kindly if you would please to prove the contrary.</P>
<P N="4">4. And as to his pretence, that his Proposition was an Universal Negative; Therefore we were oblig'd by it to give our Instance: It is a great mistake, and contra|ry to all the uncontested Rules of Disputation, nor could any order possibly be observ'd, if it should be admitted. For how easy were it for an Opponent in any case, thus to oblige the Respondent to change places with him&mdash;which what confusion it would create, any one that hath an insight into these things, will easily imagine. That Rule hath therefore (as far as we can find) universally obtain'd.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="55"><HI>Neuter Disputantium alterius partes suscipiat, neque; opponens in partem Respondentis involet, aut contra</HI>; And consequently a very Principal part of the work of a Moderatot lies, in keeping each within their proper Limits. <HI>Regimen praesidis in eo consistit, ut diligenter attendat, utrum Opponens &amp; Respondens suo officio fungantur necne: Si utrumque aut alterutrum ab Officio suo recedentem conspexe|rit, eum sui muneris admoneat, &amp; intra limites contineat, ne extra oleas (uti dici Solet) evagentur.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Nor will that known Rule <HI>Negantu non est probare,</HI> and <HI>asserenti incumbit probatio,</HI> mention'd by <HI>Dr. Smith</HI> at all avail our Anabaptist Champion: As indeed it never was intended by that Worthy Person to any such purpose, as he hath allow'd us to assure the World: and as did plainly enough appear to all the Judicious part of the Company, when he spoke those words: his design was (as the design of the Rule it self, at least when apply'd to Logical Disputations) that the Proof lies not on the Respondent, who only denies, or distinguishes upon his Adver|sary, but upon the Opponent, who is the Asserter, whether his Arguments run in an Affirmative or Negative Form. But thus much is more than sufficient to expose his ridiculous Trifling under that Head.</P>
<P N="2">2. He next reflects upon Mr. <HI>Chandler,</HI> as if he was at a Loss, so that Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> and Mr. <HI>Robinson</HI> were forced <HI>to help him out with their Distinctions and Equivocable Expressions,</HI> page 11, Whereas, if, Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> did offer any Distinctions, 'twas what belong'd to him, as an appointed Disputant with Mr. <HI>Chandler:</HI> And that they spoke promiscuously, is owing to a Proposal made by the <HI>A|nabaptists,</HI> that the Disputants might be allow'd it; which ac|cordingly was agreed before we went to the place of Disputati|on. So that 'tis Ridiculous Trifling for him, from Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI>'s sometimes speaking, who was allow'd equal Liberty with Mr. <HI>Chandler</HI> himself, to infer <HI>that Mr.</HI> Chandler <HI>was at a Loss, and Mr.</HI> Leigh <HI>forc'd to help him out.</HI> And it is somewhat more than Trifling, and should be inserted among the Falshoods, what he asserts, p. 16. <HI>That Mr.</HI> Chandler <HI>finding himself unable to answer,
 quitted the place of a Disputant, and Mr.</HI> Leigh <HI>desired to take it up, which was admitted upon condition,</HI> &amp;c. Whereas it was mov'd the Night before the Disputation, when <HI>the Anabaptists</HI> came in a Body to us at Mr. <HI>Williams</HI>'s House, <HI>That we would admit the Principal and his Second to speak promiscuously.</HI> The Reason given was, <HI>Because Dr.</HI> Russel, <HI>or Mr.</HI> John Williams, <HI>had an Infirmity that sometimes disabled him from speaking for a considerable time vo|geb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er.</HI> We took till the morning to consider of the Proposal, and then at the Hour and Place prefix'd we gave that Liberty to them, provided the same might be allow'd to us, which was
<PB N="70" REF="56">
consented to. Upon which it was resolved on both sides, <HI>That the Disputants should be allow'd to assist each other, as they saw oc|casion.</HI> With what Face now can this man insinuate to the world, <HI>That Mr.</HI> Leigh, <HI>in the midst of the Disputation begg'd leave to speak, and could not be admitted but upon Terms</HI>: And all this only to set off that False Lie, <HI>viz. That Mr.</HI> Chandler <HI>quitted the Place of a Disputant.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to what we were upon: <HI>Mr.</HI> Leigh <HI>help'd out Mr. Chandler with his Distinctions.</HI> We grant he was helpful to him, and was chosen for that purpose, and was not Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> also to the best of his skill helpful to <HI>Dr. Russel</HI>? But <HI>Mr. Leigh</HI> helped out <HI>Mr.</HI> Chandler, and <HI>Mr. Williams</HI> did his best to help out Dr. <HI>Russel,</HI> tho thro the badness of the Cause, he neither did, nor could help him out. But <HI>Mr. Robinson</HI> helpt too with his Distinctions. 'Tis false; and his own Narrative (as it happens) will manifest it to be so; for that Distinction there mention'd by <HI>Mr. Robinson,</HI> is there mentioned not as his own, but <HI>Mr. Chandler</HI>'s; and it was only mention'd to shew the no occasion he had to spend Time in proposing such frivolous Que|stions; a sufficient Answer to which he had already had from <HI>Mr. Chandler.</HI></P>
<P>There only remains under this head, <HI>Mr. Leighs</HI> and <HI>Mr. Ro|binsons</HI> helping out <HI>Mr. Chandler</HI> with their Equivocable Expressi|ons. But this (<HI>Equivocable</HI>) like the (<HI>Senate at Cambridge,</HI>) is a word of the Famous <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s.</HI> own coining, and therefore he best knows the meaning of it. Equivocal we have often heard of, but equivocable we know not what to make of, unless by this, added to the <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> Instances of his Learn|ing, we be left to collect that (as he says) he was Created a <HI>Dr</HI> in the most proper sense <HI>Ex Inhabili Materia. Doctor ex non docto.</HI> Yet if he intend Equivocal Expressions, tho he charge them up|on us, they are his own peculiar Talent. Perhaps few <HI>Iesuits</HI> herein equal or exceed him at that sort of Weapon. If any thing said by us, was grievous to him, it was not that we us'd Equivocal Expressions of our own, but that we repeated and di|stinguish'd upon his.</P>
<P N="3">3. How impertinently doth he Trifle, when he over-loaded his 3d Argument with a multitude of Propositions? Tho Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> deny'd first, <HI>That the Apostle</HI> Paul <HI>did never declare that In|fant-Baptism is a Gospel Institution:</HI> yet could he never have it prov'd. Suppose he did (which yet he neither did nor can) prove that <HI>Paul</HI> never declar'd it in his Writings, yet how will he ever prove that he never declar'd it at any time by word of mouth? which yet <HI>if he assert,</HI> he must prove. And how fri|volously doth he afterwards talk of our having in our Custody
<PB N="71" REF="56">
any such unwritten Tradition? We never did assert, the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> did declare any such thing by word of mouth that is not written, only said, <HI>he might do it,</HI> and put this wonderful man to prove he did not. And how insufferably weak and trifling are all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Reflections he hath under this Head cast upon us! While this was the Sum of what was said to his <HI>Minor</HI> or Antecedent. But afterwards we deny'd also his <HI>Major</HI> or consequent; that unless <HI>Paul</HI> declar'd the Baptism of Infants, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t was no part of the Counsel of God, which (by his own account) he never prov'd; nor is it indeed capable of proof, unless what <HI>Paul</HI> declar'd must stand instead of the whole Scripture to us. And tho the Apostle tells us, <HI>he had not shunn'd to declare,</HI> yet he never tells us that he had actually declar'd the whole Counsel of God, <HI>Acts</HI> 20.27. <GAP DESC="foreign">. The word intimates he did not prevaricate with them, or fraudulently keep back any truth, that in the course of his Ministry among them, he had a call from God to deliver to them: He he did not do as <HI>Peter</HI> faultily did <HI>Gal.</HI> 2.12. <GAP DESC="foreign">, who with-drew, sought Subterfuges thro' a mean and Timorous Spirit, conceal'd the truth when it was most especially to be own'd by him; and for which the Apostle rebuk'd him <HI>v.</HI> 11. now (says he) I did not from any such mean or base Prin|ciple, suppress or hide from you, or misrepresent to you any part of the Mind of God; but have freely and boldly declar'd to you, so far as I had opportunity, and there was any occasi|on for it, the whole Counsel of God. Not that we can imagite the Apostle had any opportunity to declare the whole of what God had at any time, by any Messenger, reveal'd of his Coun|sel. Nor was there occasion he should spend his Time among them upon such Points with which they were well acquainted be|fore; especially while he had himself immediate Revelations from Heaven to communicate to them. If therefore it could (as it never can) be prov'd that <HI>Paul</HI> never said a word of In|fant Baptism to them, it would by no means follow that it is no part of the Counsel of God: but only, that it was no part of what was immediately reveal'd from Heaven to himself, nor a|ny thing that he needed to insist upon among them, who might otherways and sufficiently be instructed about it. We might therefore (when we had deny'd the consequence) with just Rea|son say as p. 21. Suppose but not grant that <HI>Paul</HI> had not spo|ken a word of Infant Baptism, yet they cannot in the least ad|vantage their cause by it. And so our Opposition stands good against that Argument; even as he himself doth represent the closing of it.</P>
<P N="4">4. His Reflection upon us especially upon Mr. <HI>Robinson,</HI> for refusing to admit him to harrangue the People upon the words
<PB N="72" REF="57">
of the Commission is (if possible) yet more trifling. Was he not not allow'd to argue from the Commission? And was not that all that was fit to be allow'd him? Was he interrupted in read|ing the Text? What would the Man have! Why verily he wanted to illuminate us and our hearers with his Preach<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nt upon the Text. Poor Ignorant Souls! He perhaps apprehend|ed we could not understand the Commission without his help. In the presence of so many Ministers and particularly of him that had the right of the place; he might have had the Civility to have ask'd leave, or to have forborn till invited to it. Be|sides he knew our company came together, not to hear a Ser|mon especially from him, but to attend a Disputation: The man must by all means Preach and having nam'd a Text, he begins, <HI>This Commission is very solemnly deliver'd, wherein our Lord tells us, that all power in Heaven and Earth is given to him, and by vertue of that Power.</HI>&mdash;And here he takes it ill to be interrupted.&mdash;And we must be reflected on as <HI>Lucifugae Scripturarum,</HI> Bats and Owls that are afraid of the Commission, and fly the light of the Scrip|ture, because we would not suffer him to go on with his Imper|tinent Harangue: As if it was all one to refuse to hear a Text of Scripture read, to as hear his Comment upon it: How excessive|ly doth this man dote on his own Labours!</P>
<P N="5">5. How Egregiously doth he trifle p. 24. when because our Moderator would not suffer Mr. <HI>Calvins</HI> Authority to stand for an Argument, he Reflects as if he had no esteem for him. Whereas there are few Names since the Apostles days, for which he hath so great a Veneration. What? is it impossible, in this Dr's opinion, to have a Veneration for a Person, unless we take his, <HI>ipse dixit,</HI> and swallow down all he says without chew|ing. But doth Mr. <HI>Calvin</HI> any where say, That the whole of the Commission is expressed in <HI>Mat.</HI> 28.19. <HI>Mar.</HI> 16.16. And tho he say, <HI>Infants are not expresly mention'd in this Command,</HI> yet we are sure his Comment on the Place (which will best discover his Judg|ment) says, <HI>That God includes Infants in speaking to their Parents</HI>; and so that Baptism, when apply'd to Infants, is not separated<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from Faith and teaching. And this he speaks in opposition to the <HI>Anabaptists,</HI> who made a great noise against <HI>Infant-Bapti
sm,</HI> upon this Pretence. See his own words, <HI>Harm. Evang. in Mat.</HI> 28.19. <HI>Verum quia docere prius jubet Christus, quam Baptizare; &amp; tantum credentes ad Baptismum vult recipi, videtur non rite administrari Baptis|mus, nisi fides praecesserit: ar&abque; hoc praetextu multum tumultuati sum Anabaptistae contra Paedo-Baptismum; Solutio tamen non difficilis est.</HI> And so goes on to answer this Argument. Wherein he hath these Words, <HI>Quae olim Iudaeis data fuit promiss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, Inter gentes quo&abque; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> hodie, necesse est.

What he soon after adds, <HI>p.</HI> 24. to reflect on Mr. <HI>Robinson,</HI> as interrupting him, is as little to the purpose. He that pretends to Learning, and needs <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> hear any more of an Hypothetical Syllogism, than the <HI>Major,</HI> or conse|quent, is none of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s wise men. 'Twas as well known to Mr. <HI>Robinson</HI> what would follow as to Dr. R. the Speaker. How is it then that he insinuates as if he answered a matter before he heard it?</P>
<P N="6">6. As to what he says p. 30. about <HI>Erasmus</HI>'s skill about the Etymology of a <HI>Greek</HI> Word, 'tis most ridiculously impertinent. Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> had a little before, very honestly acknowledg'd, that for his part, he neither knew what belong'd to <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Latine</HI> and yet presently quotes <HI>Erasmus</HI> as reading the Commission. Go Teach all Nations, and when they have learn'd dip them. Mr. <HI>Robinson</HI> remembring what he had said before, admir'd to hear him quote <HI>Erasmus</HI>: and therefore ask'd him whether <HI>Erasmus</HI> ever wrote in English? Or how he knew that he so read the Commission? But there was not a word said by any one about <HI>Erasmus</HI>'s skill in the Etymology of a <HI>Greek</HI> word, but he must still be trifling.</P>
<P N="7">7.

But the Que|stion was not whether that was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> way: But whether Dipping, Plunging, Overwhelming was the only way? And when we held him to the proof of that, He knew not how to alter the Argument, so as to bring the words of the Question into the Conclusion of his <HI>Syllogism</HI>: We then perceiv'd him to be <HI>Cleri|cus in Libro</HI>; and that, when put out of his Road, he was lost. However that he might seem to say somewhat he told the Com|pany, <HI>his Argument was an Induction.</HI> It should be remembred, that he had lately been confounded by Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI>'s Induction: and many Reasons concur, to make it probable, that he scarce ever heard so much as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he Name before. But with them that understood t

Mr. <HI>Ring</HI> had given over writing long before this, and Mr. <HI>Bows</HI> and Mr. <HI>Webber</HI> were asham'd of their <HI>Goliah,</HI> and therefore about this time basely deserted and left him alone. The true account in short is this. Mr. <HI>Chandler</HI> told <HI>Dr. Russel</HI> that <HI>Baptizo</HI> was so far from always signifying to dip, that <HI>Bapto</HI> it self sometimes signifys to wet or wash; And mention'd that Text. <HI>Dan.</HI> 4.33. <HI>Nebuchadnezzar was wet with the dew of Heaven,</HI> in the <HI>Greek</HI> it is <GAP DESC="foreign">. To which <HI>Russel</HI> reply'd the <HI>Hebrew</HI> is not <GAP DESC="foreign"> To which Mr. <HI>Chandler</HI> return'd the <HI>Greek</HI> word we were then

inquiring into. However, to try his skill in <HI>Hebrew,</HI> who had so shamefully falter'd in the <HI>Greek,</HI> he was ask'd what the <HI>He|brew</HI> word was. He said, if he had an <HI>Hebrew</HI> Bible he could tell. Mr. <HI>Chandler</HI> handed his, being <HI>Athias</HI>'s 2<HI>d Edit. Amstel.</HI> 1668. with the Books in <HI>Latine</HI> Letters, plac'd after the same order with other <HI>Hebrew</HI> Bibles. He could not find the place, but read <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.1. which he also falsly Pronounced. Mr. <HI>Chandler</HI> re|turn'd: Sir we come not hither, to inquire whether you can read <HI>Hebrew,</HI> but what the <HI>Hebrew</HI> word is in this place. Then Mr. <HI>Robinson</HI> folded down the place for him: On which he mutter'd something to himself, which his nearest Neighbours could not hear; and said the word was not there. But he hath not told us to this day what the word is. <HI>Hebrew</HI> Bibles are all misplac'd with him; for we hear from good hands that at <HI>Ha|vering</HI> in <HI>Essex,</HI> he was confounded with the same place, and could not find the Prophecy of <HI>Daniel.</HI> Now we would be|friend him against he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ngages in the next Heckny Prize, and inform him of a great Secret; That <HI>Daniel</HI> is mostly <HI>Chaldee</HI> and the word there is not <HI>Tabal</HI> but <HI>Zavang</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, a word of the same Import. And this Mr. <HI>Chandler</HI> understood, not before he was Born, but before the Creation of <HI>Dr. Russel.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>BY this time it appears how unregardable both this pre|tended Narrative is, and it's pretended Antho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> A Pam|phlet stuff'd with such Notorious Falshoods, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> hap|pens to speak Truth, trifling so Egregiously, with what con|tempt doth it deserve to be Treated by the World? But there is yet one thing further, that may help to discover the man, and that, is the <HI>Narrow</HI> and uncharitable <HI>Principles,</HI> that have drop'd from him; and these we shall briefly animadvert upon.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. In the very first page of the Narrative, Speaking of Mr. <HI>Chandler</HI>'s <HI>Thursday</HI> Lectures at <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> he tells you they were manag'd, so as was to the <HI>Grief of such as truly Fear God in those parts.</HI> Why! What was the Offence? He tells you it was given out, that Mr. <HI>Chandler</HI> would not only prove Infant Baptism from Scripture; but also furnish his hearers with Arguments to defend their Practice. Why! We cannot Imagine how this should grieve any that truly Fear God. To have a truth prov'd, a truth about which so ma|ny good Men differ, to have it clear'd from Scripture Testi|mony, to have the Oracles of God unfolded about it: 'Tis strange this should be grievous to any: Yes (says he) <HI>It was to the Grief of them that truly Fear God in those parts.</HI> We are at a loss to know the Reason why it should be grievous to any such, and here he will not help us out. However (say we,) was it to the grief of such as were perswaded of this Truth! Were they griev'd to have it clear'd up and be furnish'd with Arguments for the defence of it? This can't be his meaning. Every one is pleas'd to see what he believes to be the truth, set in a clear Light&mdash;those that were for the Baptism of Infants could not be griev'd at it: No, that he doth not say, but those that <HI>Fear God, that truly Fear him,</HI> were grieved at it. So that (with him) none that are for Infant Baptism in those parts will be allowed truly to Fear God. Not one besides the poor Bap|tists, as he calls them, pag. 2. here's Charity with a Witness! All the Regular Members of the conforming and non-conform|ing Congregations, are censur'd as destitute of the true Fear of
<PB N="84" REF="63">
God! Pray <HI>Dr.</HI> your Reason for this! Will you condemn us and not tell us why? What is there in the notion of Infant Baptism that is inconsistent with the Fear of God? Why may not a Person be of Opinion, that he ought with the greatest seriousness to devote and consecrate his Children to God; and enter them by Baptism into his Covenant, and bring them under early bonds to him, and yet for all this <HI>truly Fear God</HI>! Nay the rather do it, because he truly Fears God?</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That he may shew it is not an unwary Expression, but his deliberate Judgment; He doth in the very last Paragraph of his Pamphlet lay the same stress on the Point of <HI>Dipping.</HI> His concluding Prayer is, that as God had made the hearing of the dispute of such use to several Persons, that they were fully convinc'd, and did a few days after sub|mit to be dipt&mdash;So it may be of like use to many others in the Reading&mdash;That so there may be <HI>added to the Church such as shall be say'd.</HI> Such a Prayer scarce ever before appear'd in Print, made up of falshood and uncharitableness. It is amazing to us that a man dare venture into the presence of God with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in his Mouth, and such uncharitableness in his Heart. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lshoo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> we have animadverted upon, <HI>Cap.</HI> 1. Paragraph 10. The uncharitableness we are now to take notice of. He prays that as several <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> hearing, so many others by reading, may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and Submit to be dip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> so there may be added to the Church such as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> be sav'd. What Apprehensions must thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> man have of those that never were dipt? Why they are not yet added to the Church. No not to the Anabaptists Church! but we dou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> are added to the Church of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">. Yet whatever we think, his charitable ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> will not allow they can otherwise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the Church, and consequently no othe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wise sav'd, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> it consists in de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ying Infant Baptism, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Necessity of Dipping. If you agree with him in these and according <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> be dipt, you are (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> as we can find,) added to the Church <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of Faith, Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">enta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce, Obe|dience, toward <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> being dipt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on water upon professi|on, is with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> instead of all these; But tho' you be Regene|rate and Sanctify'd through <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, Soul and Spirit, Walk humbly with God, and unblamably before Men; Yet if you were Baptiz'd only in your Infancy, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f when adult, not by dipping: There is no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> for you if this man were to be your Judg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> But blessed be God we are to be try'd at an an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ther Bar.

<P>But let this Mans notions of Religion be never so narrow and uncharitable, we declare <HI>our Religion</HI> is of no less compass than <HI>Christianity</HI> it self. All that hold the Essentials of Religion, we account to be of the same Religion with us: Tho' they differ from us in some inconsiderable matters. We will not be perswaded to look upon the English Episcopal, or the Foreign <HI>Presbyterian.</HI> The Congregational, or Anabaptists themselves, to be of a differing Religion from us; to be destitute of <HI>the True Fear God,</HI> or shut out of <HI>Christs Church,</HI> Religion consists in tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> which is <HI>Common</HI> to the Pious and Sober of all these Partys, and not in any thing that distinguisheth them from each other.&mdash;We abominate such a narrow strait-laced Principle, as would place Religion in being for or against Liturgies, for or a|gainst this or that form of Church-Government, for or against In|fant Baptism, or this or that mode of Administration. These things are none of them great enough, to be the Terms of Eternal Life: The Final Sentence will not proceed upon them: We believe with St. <HI>Peter that God is no Respecter of Persons, but in every Nation,</HI> and among every party of Men, that hold to the head Christ Jesus: <HI>He that Feareth God and worketh Righte|ousness, shall be accepted of him.</HI> Acts 10.34, 35. and with St. Paul: <HI>The Kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but Righteousness and Peace and joy in the Holy Ghost, and he that in these things serves Christ is acceptable to God and approv'd among Men.</HI> Whether he be for or agai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st these things we have nam'd, or any of the like kind. <HI>Rom.</HI> 14.17, 18.</P>
