<L>ON MARY's Tomb, thr&ocirc; rowling Years,</L>
<L>The Mournful Graces all shall weep;</L>
<L>And, with fresh Lamps and flowing Tears,</L>
<L>The Virtues endless Vigils Keep.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For MARY distant Lands shall Mourn</L>
<L>VVhen late Records Her Deeds relate,</L>

<L>Fair ALBION shall with watchful Trust,</L>

<L>But let the KING forsake his Woes,</L>
<L>Reflecting on his fair Renown;</L>
<L>And take the Cypress from his Brows,</L>
<L>To put his wonted Lawrels on.</L>

<LG>
<L>The Lovely Dead, whom He regrets,</L>
<L>Can know no Fear, can feel no Grief:</L>
<L>The living World, whom He forgets,</L>
<L>Would perish without His Relief.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In vain the British Lyons roar,</L>
<L>While prest by Grief their MONARCH stoops;</L>
<L>The Belgic Darts will wound no more,</L>
<L>If He, whose Hand sustain'd them, droops:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Embattel'd Princes wait their Chief,</L>
<L>Whose Voice should rule, whose Arm should lead;</L>
<L>And, in Kind Murmurs, chide that Grief</L>
<L>Which hinders EUROPE's being freed.</L>

<L>The great Example they demand</L>

<L>They seek that Joy which used to glow</L>

<LG>
<L>Oh! give the Mourning Nations Joy,</L>
<L>Break forth, great Sun, with usual Light:</L>
<L>And let thy stronger Beams destroy</L>
<L>Those Clouds, which keep Thee from our sight.</L>

<L>Advance in thy Meridian Course,</L>

</LG>

<L>See, pious KING, with different strife</L>
<L>Thy struggling ALBION's Bosom torn;</L>
<L>So much She fears for WILLIAM's Life,</L>
