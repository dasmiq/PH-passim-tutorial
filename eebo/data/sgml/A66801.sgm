<HEAD>To the READERS</HEAD>
<OPENER>The Stationer <HI>sends Greeting:</HI></OPENER>
<P>_WHereas I have undertaken to col|lect a <HI>Miscellany</HI> of all Humours which our Fam'd Comedies have exquisitely and aptly represented in the becoming dress of the Stage: Now know ye that I think fit in compliance with the Design to usher in this <HI>Body</HI> of <HI>Humours</HI> with a Preface, for no other reason, nor to other purpose, then to humour and imitate the <HI>Mode</HI> of Writers; letting you see the <HI>folly</HI> and <HI>imperti|nence</HI> of Epistolary <HI>Personations</HI> (never <HI>acted</HI> be|fore) which shew their Books are chiefly writ|ten for their own sakes, and to <HI>adorn</HI> our <HI>Stalls.</HI></P>
<P>Now I must tell you, my <HI>Plot</HI> with my <HI>Hu|mours</HI> is clearly for sale; for I intend to raise no other reputation to my self then that of Ready Money; and that I onely be-speak in these pre|paratory lines: since it were besides the pur|pose, and an unpardonable presumption, to <HI>com|mend</HI> these excellent Fancies, which do <HI>command,</HI> and have <HI>Emerited</HI> universal applause.</P>
<P>All I am obliged to say therefore, is in justi|fication
<PB REF="3">
of the Collection of them into this en|tire <HI>consistencie,</HI> the making of a <HI>fluid</HI> a <HI>solid</HI> Body, which even the <HI>Experiment</HI> it self, among the In|genious, will fairly defend. But I should think the easie <HI>accommodation</HI> of them to every <HI>Gusto</HI> of Delight in this ready <HI>variety</HI> (saving the <HI>difficulty</HI> of <HI>purveying</HI> and hacking up and down) should best <HI>invite</HI> and <HI>entertain</HI> you.</P>
<P>He that knows a Play, knows that Humours have no such <HI>fixedness</HI> and indissoluble <HI>connexion</HI> to the Design, but that without <HI>injury</HI> or <HI>forcible revulsion</HI> they may be <HI>removed</HI> to an <HI>advantage;</HI> which is so demonstrable, that I am sure nothing but a <HI>morose propriety</HI> will offer to deny it.</P>
<P>To be a little serious: I was told by people that know better then my self, they would be in this Model more beneficial in sundry respects, then as they lay dispersed before. There is no sort of Melancholy whose sullen dulness and severe aversion to company, may not at one look be mockt out by one or other of these merry <HI>attempe|ratures</HI> and resemblances, which will most effica|ciously manifest its Folly as in a Glass. Next, he who would make up a Treatment to his Friends by any such diversion, cannot study a more com|pendious method, without the help of Fidlers and mercenary Mimicks, and the long labor of a Cue: one Scene, which may almost be acted <HI>Extempore,</HI> will be abundantly satisfactory, being chosen fit and suitable to the Company, as none can come amiss. 'Twill make Physick work, 'twill cease
<PB REF="3">
the pains of more inveterate diseases, 'twill allay the heat and distemper of Wine, and generally it is the <HI>Panacea,</HI> the universal Cure, mighty Mirths <HI>Elixir.</HI></P>
<P>Now you know all the <HI>Story,</HI> Gentlemen; pray remember the <HI>Rump Drolls,</HI> and for their sakes,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your old Servant H. MARSH.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

a play, and crack more nuts then would suffice a dozen Squirils; besides the dinne, which is damnable: These are people of such a clean discretion in their dyet, of such a moderate sustenance, that they sweat, if they but smell hot meat; pottage is poyson, they hate a Kitchin as they hate a Counter, and shew'um but a Feather-bed they sound; Ale is their eating and their drinking surely, which keeps their bodies cleer, and soluble: Bread is a binder, and for that abolisht, 'ene in their Ale, whose lost room fils an Apple, which is more ayr, and of a subtler nature. The rest they take is little, and that little, is little ease, for like strict men of Order, they correct their bodies with a Bench, or a poor stubborn Table; if a Chimny offers it self with some few broken Rushes they are in Down; when they are sick, that's drunk, if they may have fresh straw, else they do despise these Worldly pamperings, for their poor apparell 'tis worne out to the dyet; new they seeke none; and if a man should offer, they are angry; scarce to be reconcil'd again with him: you shall not heare'um ask one cast Doublet once in a year: which is modesty befitting my poor friends: you see their Wardrope, though slender, competent: for shirts I take it, they are things worn out of their remembrance, lowzy they will be when they list, and mangie, which shews a fine variety; and then to cure'um a Tanners Lime-pit which is little charge, to Dogges and these, these two may be cur'd for three pence.</P>

<SPEAKER>Grav.</SPEAKER>
<P>It must be so offended, it cannot be else; for here lies the point, if I drown my self willingly it argues an act, and an act hath three branches, it is to act, to do, to perform, or all; she drown'd her selfe wittingly.</P>

<P>Give me leave, here lyes the water, good, here stands the man, good, if the man go to this water and drown himself, it is nill he, will he; he goes, mark you that: but if the water come to him and drowns him, he drowns not himself; argall, he that is not guilty of his own death, shortens not his own life.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Swab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pish, tell not me, 'tis neither his arms nor his legs that I stand upon; he has caused me to go in danger of my Life: for the other day I had an occasion to pass by a worshipful Gentleman's pack of Hounds, they no sooner looked upon my forehead, but they came at me in full cry; and I for fear left such a sent behind me, that they came after me as perfectly by it, as if I had been a Stagg; and if I had not got shelter of a house, without doubt I had been presented to some great man for Venison, and my Hanches had been baked by this time.</P>

<P>Remember, sirrah, who you speak before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I speak before a Miller, a Thief in grain; for he steals Corn. He that steals a Wench, is a true Man, to him.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can you prove that?</P>
</SP>

<P>He that steals Corn, steals the Bread of the Common|wealth: he that steals a Wench, steals but the flesh.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how is their Bread-stealing more criminal then the flesh?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>He that steals bread, steals that which is lawful every day: he that steals flesh, steals nothing from the

<P>Again, he that steals flesh, steals for his own bel|ly full: he that steals bread, robs the Guts of others: <HI>Ergo,</HI> the arranter Thief the Bread-stealer. Again, he that steals flesh, steals once and gives over; yes, and often pays for it; the other steals every day without satisfacti|on. To conclude, Bread-stealing is the more Capital Crime: for what he steals, he puts it in at the head; he that steals flesh (as the Dutch Author saies) puts it in at the foot (the lower Member.)
