<L>Wend on in peace, and prosecute this course,</L>
<L>You Ilanders on whom the milder aire</L>
<L>Doth sw&eacute;etly breath the balme of kinde increase:</L>
<L>Whose lands are fatned with the deaw of heauen,</L>
<L>And made more fruitfull then <HI>Actean</HI> plaines.</L>
<L>You whom delitious pleasures dandle soft:</L>
<L>Whose eyes are blinded with securitie,</L>
<L>Unmaske your selues, cast error cleane aside.</L>
<L>O London, mayden of the mistresse Ile,</L>
<L>Wrapt in the foldes and swathing cloutes of shame:</L>
<L>In th&eacute;e more sinnes then <HI>Niniuie</HI> containes,</L>
<L>Contempt of God, dispight of reuerend age.</L>
<L>Neglect of law, desire to wrong the poore:</L>
<L>Corruption, whordome, drunkennesse, and pride.</L>
<L>Swolne are thy browes with impudence and shame.</L>
<L>O proud adulterous glorie of the West,</L>
<L>Thy neighbors burns, yet doest thou feare no fire.</L>
<L>Thy Preachers crie, yet doest thou stop thine eares.</L>
<L>The larum rings, yet sl&eacute;epest thou secure.</L>
<L>London awake, for feare the Lord do frowne,</L>
<L>I set a looking Glasse before thine eyes.</L>
<L>O turne, O turne, with w&eacute;eping to the Lord,</L>
<L>And thinke the praiers and vertues of thy Qu&eacute;ene,</L>
<L>Defers the plague which otherwise would fall.</L>
<L>Repent O London, least for thine offence,</L>
<L>Thy shepheard faile, whom mightie God preserue,</L>
<L>That she may hide the pillar of his Church,</L>
<L>Against the stormes of Romish Antichrist:</L>
<L>The hand of mercy ouershead her head,</L>
<L>And let all faithfull subiects say, <HI>Amen.</HI></L>
