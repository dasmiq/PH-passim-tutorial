<ITEM>*Added TEMPHEAD, checked ID, and added TYPEs to DIVs in order to validate.
*Ran capitalizations.
*Checked for GROUP tags.
Moved GROUP tag to directly preceding PB REF="4" since "to the reader" and "errata" belong to the entire group of texts and not just to the first one.  Placed / GROUP right after PB REF="109" N="202" since following material is BACK matter for the entire group of texts.
*Proofed title page(s).
Added P / FIGURE to title pages.
*Checked for TYPE=book.
*Checked I / J.
*Checked ^s.
*Checked oe for ae ligatures.
*Reviewed structure.
Made material on PB REFs="4-7" FRONT matter for the first TEXT.
Removed LETTER tag from PB REF="98" N="183" and treated material as two marginal notes.
*Checked placement and completeness of PBs.
*Checked for damage GAPs, #s, @s, --s, &mdash;, q;s, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>  and UNCLEARs.
*Corrected $word$s and $s by inserting vendor-responsible GAP DESC and in some instances by inserting the appropriate character(s) and / or GAP DESC(s).
*Checked for duplicate pages.
Added EXTENT attribute to duplicate pages.
*Checked for missing pages.
Added "PAGES" to missing page.
*Checked spacing of foreign GAPs.
*Checked for &amp;cs with incorrect spacing.
*Checked for LBs.
*Checked for OPENERs, DATELINEs, DATEs, SIGNEDs, CLOSERs, TRAILERs, BYLINEs, etc.
On PB REF="3" added LIST / ITEMs to CLOSER / SIGNED.
*Checked for TABLEs and LISTs.
*Checked for startqs, endqs and Qs.
*Checked proofsheets and made corrections.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Courteous Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_AMongst other Treatises of this deceased Author, of which, in their due time, we intend to make thee partaker, we have, in the first place, made choice of this, as well in some measure to keep our word with thee, as also to stay thy expectation till other things can be made ready. We intend not to spend time either in the commendation of It or the Author, being w<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter">ll assured that our words will not, where the matter it self is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 span"> capable to, satisfie therein the judicious Reader. Onely let <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 word"> say thus much, that though the generall Subject of this Book <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Dialling,</HI> yet 'tis handled in a way which no man whosoever,
<PB REF="3">
that we know of, hath hitherto fully traced. For by it thou wilt see, that the representing the true Houre by the shadow made by the Axis of the World is but one of those infinite wayes which may be invented, and that it is as possible to do the same thing by the shadow of the Axis of one of the vertical Circles, and by the projection of one Ellipsis upon a plain, sup|ply the place of all the Parallels comprehended within the Tro|picks. 'Tis true, that Mr. <HI>Va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lezard,</HI> a learned <HI>Mathema|tician,</HI> we think yet living in <HI>France,</HI> hath some yeers since published a short Treatise in that Language, in which he shew|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th by the projection of an Ellipsis upon the plain of the Hori|zon, and by the help of an upright moveable stile to finde the He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re and Azimuth, with some other uses of the same. But this Treatise of our Author is very different from that, and most of the things here handled, such as are not appliable to his, and in themselves wholly new.</P>
<P>In the next place, if it shall seem strange to any that amongst other things, as well of this, as of different natures, which we intend shortly to Publish; we begin first with this of Dialling (a Subject upon which something too hath already been published by our Author, and from whence some might perhaps take occasion to carp at him, as either unable for other things, or too much busied in this) we desire them first to con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|der how difficult this Subject hath been thought by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and withall what large Volumes have been writ by som<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB REF="3">
of the best rank of later <HI>Mathematicians,</HI> (such were <HI>Cla|vius, Maigran,</HI> and others) and then compare their wayes with what they shall here and hereafter (God willing) finde in our Author, and we doubt not, but they will be forced to yield him it this honour, to have made that <HI>Art,</HI> in all the Cases of it, and all Circumstances thereunto belonging, more easie and expedite both in the Understanding and Practice, and with much more brevity than any that have gone before him either of our own or other Nations.</P>
<P>Lastly, we advertize thee (<HI>Reader</HI>) that our Authour, in regard of his great and long infirmities, could not fit either this, or any other of his Treatises for the Presse, as he desired and intended; and therefore they must needs want much of that accomplishment which otherwise they would have had. But we hope, notwithstanding, thou wilt finde so much of worth in them as they now are, whereby thou wilt judge them (as we do) fitter to be made publick, then wholly suppressed.</P>

<P>These lines thus crossing one another will make small Pa|rallelograms, which will shew both where the Ellipsis is to be drawn, and where to be divided. For,

<P N="3">3. First, If a curved line be begun at D or 12, and car|ried both wayes diagonally through the succeeding Paral|lelograms, the same line shall be the Ellipsis required. Thus you see it carried from D to 11, from 11 to 10, from 10

And on the other side in the same manner, from D, diagonally through 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. This line thus regularly described without angles, and extravagant inordinate flexures, is the Ellipsis here intended.</P>
<P>Secondly, If from the center A, through each of the angular points in the small Parallelograms, certain short lines be drawn, (as in the figure you see done at 11, 10, 9, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and at 1, 2, 3, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) the same lines shall be the requi|site horary divisions of the Elliptical line.</P>
<P N="4">4. If these divisions into single houres shall not be e|nough, but that more exactnesse is required, into halves and quarters; then must you (besides the Sines of whole houres at <HI>a, b, &amp;c. l, m, &amp;c.</HI>) put in the right Sines of the in|termediate halves and quarters of the equall houres; which will be easie to do by the former directions.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. I. Of the <HI>Elliptical Dial,</HI> where the Index stands perpendicular to the Plain: How to draw it for an <HI>Horizontal</HI> Plain, or any other Plain that declineth not.</HEAD>
<P>_BEcause here is no declination supposed, there|fore the draught will be the more easie.</P>
<P N="1">1. Make B C for the longer Diameter of your Ellipsis, and count one halfe of it, that is A B or A C as the Radius, and through the point A, draw an infinite line (as D E) at right angles to B C. Then for the shorter Diameter, you must consider the eleva|tion of the Pole above your plain. Looke therefore to make A D or A E equall to the Sine of the Poles elevation, which Sine must be estimated to the Radius A B. Thus you have the two extream diameters.</P>
<P N="2">2. Through the four points D B E C you may describe the Ellipsis, either by Elliptical Compasses, or by finding many points through which it is to passe: for effecting which there are multitudes of wayes prescribed.</P>
<P>One may be this. Describe two Circles upon the two extream Diameters B C and D E. Divide them both into any like parts, as B <HI>f h n p q</HI> C, and V <HI>i k</HI> E <HI>o t</HI> X; and from each couple of those like divisions (as <HI>f</HI> and <HI>i</HI>) draw <HI>f g i g,</HI> (the first parallel to A <HI>n,</HI> the second parallel to A B) cut|ting each other at right angles in <HI>g,</HI> so the point <HI>g</HI> shall be one of the points through which the Ellipsis is to be de|scribed. In the same manner, from <HI>h</HI> and <HI>k</HI> must be drawn
<PB N="9" REF="8">
two lines concurring at right angles in <HI>m,</HI> which will there|fore be another point through which the Ellipsis must passe. So again from <HI>p</HI> and <HI>o, t</HI> and <HI>q,</HI> lines are to be drawn, con|curring at right angles in <HI>s</HI> and <HI>r,</HI> which are two other points of passage for the Ellipsis. After this manner may the other halfe B D C be described.</P>

<HEAD>How to divide the Ellipsis into its requisite parts.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. If the parts B <HI>f h n p q</HI> C were all equall, and 12 of them in number, then would the points <HI>g m, &amp;c.</HI> be the houre points. And accordingly, if those houres were sub|divided into equall halves and quarters, &amp;c. there would be found points for the halves and quarters, &amp;c. of the houres.
<PB N="10" REF="9">
And if the Ellipsis be first drawn, then the exteriour Circle it selfe by lines issuing out of <HI>f h p q,</HI> drawn parallel to A <HI>n</HI>) will divide the Ellipsis: or, where these lines cut it more obliquely (as at <HI>g</HI> and <HI>r, &amp;c.</HI>) there the lesser Circles equall parts (at <HI>i</HI> and <HI>t, &amp;c.</HI>) will cut the same Ellipsis at more right angles, so that one of them may help the other in this division.</P>
<P N="2">2. Or, If the quadrants B <HI>n</HI> C, or V E X (or of any other Circle described upon the center A) were divided into Horizontall Spaces, such as are proper for this Diall (as you see them done upon the quadrants B <HI>y</HI> C) and a Ruler laid from the center A did transfer those divisions into the El|lipsis (as is done upon that halfe of it which is noted with B D C) this division would be the same with the former.</P>
<P>The proportion whereby to make the Table of Horizon|tall Spaces for this Ellipsis, is inverse to that which is for common Horizontall Dials: thus,</P>
<P>As the Sine of the Poles elevation above the plain, Is to the Radius;</P>
<P>So is the Tangent of 15 <HI>gr.</HI> 30, 45, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>To the Tangent of the spaces of every houre from 12, upon the plain whereon the Ellipsis is described.</P>

<P>In generall, the Scale must be a Scale of Naturall Tan|gents.</P>
<P>In particular, there are these two Rules, one of which will with due convenience serve for all kindes of Latitudes, or elevations. You may use which is most sutable to your purpose.</P>

But if it shall better be liked that the parts should stand distinctly one from the other; it will then be most expedient, First, to limit out the whole length of the Scale: then upon that length (as a diameter) to describe a Circle, and to divide it as is here under shewed.</P>

The two Tables are the Right Ascensions of such parts of the Ecliptic as are due to the Suns place or Declination, in any of the Signes, or of any dayes of the 12 moneths. The Tables are here placed.

<P>The beginning of the equall parts or degrees, must be upon that middle Diameter of the Circle, which lies parallel to the two six a clock lines, or perpendicular to the twelve a clock line.</P>
<P>The best manner of dividing the Circle is as in the pre|ceding figure, especially if the fiduciall Circle be cut through with small divisions, that so the intersections may be the more discernable, and the Circle more distinguishable from the rest; and more cleere from mistakes.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Concerning the Index.</HEAD>
<P>The Index must stand perpendicular to the plain, and must, according to the time of the year, be neerer or further from the Ellipsis.</P>
<P>Now, Whether the Index should move upon the plate lying still, or the elliptical plate move towards the Index fixed upon another plate, must be left to every mans judge|ment and best liking. But the mover with its peculiar Index
<PB N="17" REF="12">
(called here the Zodiacall Index) must move according to the length of the plains Meridian line, either in it, or paral|lel to it, alwayes so that the fiduciall edge of the Dials In|dex may ever stand in the Meridian line.</P>
<P>But if to this Ellipticall Diall it be thought fit to joyn an ordinary Horizontal Dial (fitted to the Elevation of the Pole above the plain) that so it may set it selfe true North and South, which by this double kinde of Diall it will do; for the houres in both Dials will never agree to be the same till it stand right, and the best time for setting it, is when the Sun is in the East or West Azimuth, the worst time is at Noon: then the common Horizontal Dial may be the standing plate, the Index of the Ellipsis being fixed to it, the elliptical plate may move too and fro upon the horizon|tal fixed plate, according to the graduations of the Zodiac.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the place for the Suns Annual course or Zodiac.</HEAD>
<P>Whichsoever of the two (the Ellipsis or Index) is move|able or fixed, it matters not. In both wayes it is necessary to set the Zodiac right, which must thus be done.</P>
<P>Let the fiduciall edge of the Index be placed exactly in the center of the Ellipsis. And being there set, let the place of the line or threed (or whatever it be that serves for the Zodiacall Index) be marked upon the standing plate. Then through that mark or point draw a streight line parallel to the line of the two sixes, or perpendicular to the line of twelve. The same line is to be esteemed for the Aequino|ctiall: and from thence are all the parts of the Scale (or Cir|cle) to be insctibed by help of the former Tables.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="18" REF="13">
<HEAD>The Vses of the <HI>Elliptical Dial.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The Index and Ellipsis being used alone, and set to their true distance, by the help of the Zodiac, the Ellipsis it selfe with its upright Index, will shew the true houre of the day.</P>
<P>But it is supposed hitherto, that the plain be either direct, looking full North or South, or else Horizontal: and in every such plain, there must be drawn the Meridian line of the place or plain, which in direct flats are one and the same. And according to the Coast of this Meridian line must the moving or sliding be, as also the line of 12 upon the Ellipsis must lie in or parallel to it.</P>
<P>This way therefore requires, first, a Meridian line to be drawn, whereby to place the Ellipsis. And in all direct plains the Meridian line is the same with the Vertical line of the plain.</P>
<P>But if to this Elliptical Dial, be adjoyned a common Ho|rizontal Dial with an Axis, then there needs no finding of a Meridian line before hand, because they two betwixt them will finde one, and consequently will place themselves in a true position. Only with this <HI>proviso,</HI> that if the plain be not Horizontal, it must yet be such as looketh directly North or South. This was intimated before.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>There may other uses be made of it, if it have other Scales adjoyned to the Zodiac.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. If a Tangent line of 23&frac12;<HI>gr.</HI> be inscribed according to the length of the Zodiac, then when the situation of the Ellipsis to the Index is fitted, the Zodiacal Index will shew
<PB N="19" REF="13">
(upon this Tangent Scale) the Suns Declination.</P>
<P N="2">2. In the 11 page there are two Rules given whereby to finde that Scale of Tangents out of which the Zodiacal Scale is to be divided. If then out of that Scale of Tan|gents so found and limited, you take the Co-tangent of your Latitude, and divide that length as a Radius or whole line of Sines into houres and parts of houres, and put in so many of them as will reach the Suns greatest Declination, or the length of the Zodiac both wayes from the Equino|ctiall; then the former rectification of the Zodiacal Index to the day of the moneth or Suns place, will perfectly shew (in this Scale, and for that Latitude to which all the work is made) the Ascensional difference, with what depends there|on: namely, the length of the Day and Night, and the time of Sun Rising and Setting.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Dial being fixed in a true position, the Place or Coast of the Sun rising and setting upon the plain, may be discerned in the heavens. For when the Ellipsis is rectifi|ed, and the time of the Sun rising or setting is known (as be|fore) then with your eye project the fiduciall edge of the upright Index upon that time of Sun rising or setting counted in the Ellipsis, and the same edge will shew in the heavens whereabout the Sun will ascend or descend upon the plain. That is, it shews the Amplitude of Sun rising upon the plain.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Note, That if the plain be Horizontall, then the two last Uses serve for the place where a man lives. But if the plain be not Horizontal, then it serves not for the place, but is proper to the plain it selfe, or to that Horizon or Latitude which the plain represents, ac|cording as they are set down in the former Rules: be|cause things are done to the plains Latitude, and not to the places.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="20" REF="14">2. Note again, that if upon plain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that are not Horizontal, you would yet have them (to shew the second of these last preceding conclusions, namely,) to shew the time of Sun rising or setting for the place in which you are, and not for the plains, then must you take (not the Co-tangent of the plains Latitude, but) the Co-tangent of the Latitude of the place, just as you did in the Horizontall plain, and then the Zodi|acal Index being rectified will effect the thing requi|red for the place, and not for the plain.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Note, that both in the Horizontal and the other plains, there may be a peculiar Scale put, either for the Am|plitude proper to those plains, or else for the Ampli|tude proper to the place, if a Table of Amplitudes be computed for either of them, by this proportion.</ITEM>

<HEAD>SECT. II. How to frame the <HI>Elliptical Dial</HI> to other Plains which are not direct but declining: To an Index that standeth perpendicular to the plain.</HEAD>
<P>_IT is not here to be enquired whether the plain de|clining, be erect or leaning; for one rule serves both these kindes. But then it must first be sup|posed, that the plains situation is in all respects known, how much and which way it declines and reclines or inclines.</P>
<P>Secondly, These three things must further be found (either by calculation or otherwise) namely,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Poles elevation above the plain.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The plains difference of Longitude.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The departure of the substylar (which is the plains proper Meridian) from the Vertical line of the plain.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>These are pre-requisites to that which comes after, in which you must proceed by the following directions.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="23" REF="15">
<HEAD>How to limit and draw the <HI>Ellipsis.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Having the substylar or proper Meridian drawn upon the plain, in its true position, and also knowing the elevation of the Pole above the plain, you may, upon the substylar line, set out your shorter diameter, and on a line drawn perpendicular thereto, you may set off the longer diameter, in this pro|portion: Let the longer Diameter be as the Radius, the shorter as the Sine of the plains Latitude taken to the same Radius. Or, the longer semidiameter may be the Radius, and the shorter semidiameter must then be the Sine of the elevation of the Pole above the plain.</P>
<P>Upon these two extream diameters thus limited, may the Ellipsis be described with Elliptical Compasses. Or other|wise it may be done by two Circles, the one circumscribed, the other inscribed, both divided into like parts, and so points found through which the Ellipsis is to passe, as in the for|mer direct plains was prescribed, and through those points the Ellipsis may, with a stedfast hand be described. In right Horizons or Polar plains there will be no Ellipsis at all, but it vanisheth into a streight line only.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>How to divide the Ellipsis into such requisite parts as the plain shall require.</HEAD>
<P>If you should put in the houres proper to the plain there will be no difficulty, for then the substilar being taken for the line of 12, the houres must be drawn as before was shew|ed in direct plains. For in this case the Dial is Horizontal, shewing the houre of the day to all places that lie under that Meridian under which the plain it selfe lyeth&punc; But</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="16">If you would put in the houres of the place (as most fre|quently is desired) then you are to work (for the division of the Ellipsis) either by calculation or by protraction. If you calculate for the Ellipsis, you must first forme all the angles at the Pole as the manner is in these kindes of Dials: Then you are to invert the terms of proportion from the common way of calculating ordinary Dials, and say thus:</P>
<P>As the Sine of the Poles elevation above the plain, Is to the Radius;</P>
<P>So is the Tangent of each angle at the Pole, To the Tangent of the angular distances of all the houres from the substylar line of the plain.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="16">Supposing therefore that you had your Ellipsis before described, and the substilar line set off from the plains Ver|tical line in its true position, you may from that substylar line (and by the horary spaces found by calculation) set in every houre point into the Ellipsis, by help of any Circle described upon the center A. As you see here are two Circles, the circumscribed and the inscribed, either of which, or any other circle else, will serve to prick on the houres by. The houre points are here set upon the circumscribed Circle, and transferred into the Ellipsis by a Ruler laid to A, the common center of the Ellipsis and of the Circle. This is one way, and is best done by calculation: here you may also put in the halves, and quarters, and halfe quarters of houres, or what other parts you shall best like of.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>How to limit the Ellipsis, and divide it, without Calculation.</HEAD>
<P>But if you are desirous to do it rather by protraction, then must you work somwhat as formerly was done, the manner I will in briefe shew, wherein you may see the way both how to describe the Ellipsis, and also how to divide it, all under one.</P>
<P N="1">1. Having prepared all necessary requisites before hand, you must first set off the substilar line in its true position from the Vertical line, which to do, I here suppose already known. So in the following figure you see A C B drawn for the substilar line, or the proper meridian of the plain.</P>
<P N="2">2. Upon this plain, and upon some point of the Substy|lar line, as at A, as upon a center, describe the Circle B M E, and quarter it, and let the Semidiameter of that Circle be counted as the Radius</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="26" REF="17">3. Upon one of the quarters, set off the Poles elevation as from E to F, and draw A F, and from E to A F take the least distance, as E G, and with that distance, upon the former center A, describe another lesser Circle as C H.</P>
<P N="4">4. From B (where the greater Circle cuts the substylar) set B M equall to the plains difference of Longitude: and from M divide that exterior Circle into 24 equal parts, which signifie the 24 houres; and by a Ruler laid to the common center A, transfer them into the lesser Circle, as M H, 10 I, 6 K, &amp;c.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P N="5"><PB N="37" REF="17">5. From every point in the great Circle, draw lines paral|lel to the substylar, and from every point of the lesser Circle draw lines perpendicular to the substylar, or parallel to the longest diameter P A R, and so each couple of these lines shall cut each other at right angles.</P>
<P N="6">6. Note where every line thus drawn from any point of the greatest Circle, meets with the other line which is drawn from the like point in the lesser Circle. For the concourses of these answerable lines are the points here required. That is, Those are the points which shew both where the Ellipsis is to be drawn, and also where it is to be divided into its re|quisite parts.</P>
<P>Thus in the precedent figure: M O and H O meet in the point O, 10 L and I L meet in the point L, 6 N and K N meet in the point N, and so the rest will meet in their due places. These points shew the way where through the Ellipsis is to be drawn, and the same points shew where the houres are to be marked out. The like may be done for quarters and halfe quarters of houres, or any other division that shall be best liked of.</P>
<P>There are many other wayes to do the same things, but I suppose this to be most expedient.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Note: that</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The Index in these Elliptical Dials must stand per|pendicularly upright upon the plain, making right angles with it every way, as it was ordered to do upon the former sort of direct plains.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="28" REF="18">2. The annual course of the Sun must be limited as for|merly in the other plains, that is, making the greater semidi|ameter as a Badius, you must finde the Co-sine of the Poles elevation above the plain. This Co-sine is to be made either as a Tangent of 45 <HI>gr.</HI> whereof you are only to use 23&frac12;: Or else it is to be made a Decimal Scale. By both these you have Tables and Rules how to compleat the Suns annual course, either in degrees of the Signes in the Zodiac, or by the dayes of the 12 moneths.</P>
<P N="3">3. Either the Index must move and the Ellipsis lie still, or contrarily. Every man in this must do as his invention shall best suggest. And that motion must be made either upon the substylar line, or else parallel to it, which way so|ever it be, it must be precisely and punctually ordered.</P>
<P N="4">4. All other things concerning the time of Sun rising and setting, the Suns Amplitudes and Declinations, may here (in the same manner as before) be inserted either proper to the plain, or proper to the place, as shall be desired.</P>
<P N="5">5. In right Horizons or Polar plains, the Ellipsis closeth quite up into a streight line: and so the division of it is only by the exterior Circles parts projected upon it by those lines that are drawn parallel to the substylar.</P>
<P>Thus far of the Elliptical Dial, as it is to be described upon declining plains whose Indexes stand perpen|dicular to the plains, and which do not lie under the Meridian of the place but swerve from it.</P>

<P>_FOr this purpose here are two Tables joyned together, both of them made for the Latitude of <HI>Lon|don,</HI> 51 <HI>gr.</HI> 30 <HI>min.</HI> the like to which every man may calculate for his own place.</P>
<P>The first of them is a Table of such angles as are made by the hour lines (coming through the center of the Ellipsis) with the Meridian line or line of 12. And it was made by that rule which was given (in this case) at the beginning of this Trea|tise. Namely,</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="19">As the Sine of your Poles elevation (w^c^h is here 51 <HI>gr.</HI> 30 <HI>m.</HI>) is to the Radius;</P>
<P>So is the Tangent of each houre and their quarters (counted from 12 a clock,)</P>
<P>To the Tangent of the angle required.</P>
<P>The second Table is of the Altitudes of each houre and quarter, in the Equinoctial Circle, above the Horizon; and it is calculated by this Rule.</P>
<P>As the Radius,</P>
<P>To the Co-sine of your Latitude (which is here the Sine of 38 <HI>gr.</HI> 30 <HI>min.</HI>)</P>
<P>So is the Sine of each houre and their quarters, (counted from 6 a clock,)</P>
<P>To the Sine of the altitude which is here sought.</P>
<P>Then having computed these two Tables, you may (by help of them) both draw and divide the Ellipsis into its true houres and quarters by these following directions.</P>
<P>First, draw the two lines 6 6 and D E, crossing each other at right angles in A, and let A D be the Meridian, and 6 A 6 the two six a clock lines.</P>
<P>Then upon A as a center describe the Circle 6 D 6 of any convenient bignesse; and upon the same Circle from D (on both sides of it) set on the houres and their quarters, as 11 and 1, 10 and 2, &amp;c. by help of the degrees and minutes of the angles set to every houre in the former Table. And through every of these points inscribed into the Circle, draw lines from the center A, as A 11, A 10, A 1, A 2, with the rest of the houres and their quarters if you will.</P>
<P>Thirdly, supposing A 6 to be the Radius, you may divide
<PB N="31" REF="19">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
it into 90 Sines; the beginning or largest parts whereof must be at A, but the numeration must be the contrary way, be|ginning at 6 and ending at A in 90. Or you may take the complements of the former Altitudes in the Table, and take them out of a line of Sines numbered the right way, which will be best for the Sector, or such Instruments which will best perform this work without any great trouble.</P>
<P>Fourthly, looke in the second Table for the altitudes of the Equinoctiall at every houre. Then count those Altitudes in the line of Sines, and take with your Compasses the se|veral distances of them from A, &amp; transfer the said distances
<PB N="32" REF="20">
from the center A to every houre respectively, so shall those intersections give you the points through which the Ellipsis must be drawn.</P>
<P>Thus the altitude of 7 and 5 a clock (which is 9 <HI>gr.</HI> 17 <HI>m.</HI>) being taken upon the line of Sines from A towards S, is in|serted into 4 houres at the note <HI>m.</HI> And the altitude at 8 and 4 (which in the Table is 18 <HI>gr.</HI> 8 <HI>min.</HI>) being taken and transferred to the four houres at <HI>n,</HI> do give four points more. The rest of the altitudes give (each of them) two houres only, as at <HI>o, i,</HI> and <HI>r,</HI> is done. And the last of all at 12, gives one only point at <HI>t.</HI> The like may be done for the quarters. And so through these points thus found the Ellipsis may easily be drawn, and the lines formerly drawn give the divisions that are due unto it.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Note.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. This is propounded only for Horizontal plains, but it may without difficulty be applyed to any other direct plain. The trouble that is, comes by reason that the foresaid plains have a different elevation of the Pole, from that elevation that belongs to the Horizon or place where they are to stand: and consequently there will be required two new Tables for that elevation which is proper to the plain; the calculation of which will easily be done by the two former proportions set down for that end. Note further that by these two Tables you may prick down an Ellipsis upon any leaning (not up|right) plain whatsoever. But the Index must then lie in the Zenith line of the place, (not of the plain) and the Ellipsis (or Index) must move in the Meridian of the place (not of the plain) and the Zodiac must be like or proportional to the Zodiac of the Horizon, but augmented, for the most part, in this proportion.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="20">As the Radius, To the Secant of that angle that the Meridian line (upon the plain) makes with the Horizon; (which angle must be gott<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n by a Clinatorie;)</P>
<P>So the Radius of the Horizontal Zodiac, (which is the Co-sine of the Latitude,) To the Radius of the Zodiac proper to the plain: which Zodiac must be set according to the line of 12 upon the plain.</P>
<P N="2">2. This way of delineation may likewise be applyed to all other plains which decline, and are not direct. But in these will be found more difficulty then in the former plains which declined not, unlesse it be required to put in the houres that are proper to the plain; for in that case the work is the same which was in them. But if the houres of the place are to be inscribed, as most usually they are, then there will be some trouble, by reason that the difference of the plains Lon|gitude seldome falls upon any just houre. I purpose not here to shew the way, it being such as will prove un-pleasant to the unskilfull, and such as have knowledge will finde it out quickly. Perhaps the pleasure of the thing done, will recompense their labour.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. IV. Here follow some Vses and Varieties of this Ellipticall Diall.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>USES.</HEAD>
<P>_FIrst, If the Index stand still, and the Ellipsis be made moveable; you may upon that plate which is immoveable, and on which the Index standeth, describe a Circle, whose center must be the foot of the Index. And drawing a Me|ridian line upon the said immoveable plate (just under the Meridian of the Ellipsis, and) from the foot of the Index you may divide that Circle (beginning from the Meridian line) into 360 <HI>gr.</HI> or so many of them as shall be needfull. By these degrees you shall finde the Suns Azimuth by the shadow of the upright Index, and by the divisions of the Ellipsis you may know the houre of the day. So both Azi|muth and Houre are shewed upon the two plates by one up|right Index.</P>
<P>This kinde of Diall must be set in its true position (for it will not set it selfe) and must there be fixed. If it be upon an Horizontall, or any direct plain, you may draw a Meridi|an line thereon, and either draw the Azimuths true upon it, and so make the Ellipsis to move to and fro according to that Meridian: Or else, if both your plates be to be fixed upon any Base prepared for them, you may, first, upon that Base draw a true Meridian line, and to that line make the Meridi|an of the Diall to agree.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="21">The like must be done in all declining flats, onely you must be carefull to make the shortest Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">meter of the Ellip|sis (which is the proper Meridian of the plain) to agree with the same proper Meridian, as it shall first be drawn upon the Base in its true position.</P>
<P N="2">2. A second excellent use may be for the setting of move|able Dials, such as are made to stand out of the weather, and are only to be set in the Sun at pleasure, when the houre shall be required. Of this kinde are Polyhedrall Bodies made of some light matter, and Concaves, &amp;c. But it is supposed that some of the superficies of such Bodies, (&amp;c.) have the houres of the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ace described upon them the ordinary way, by the Axis of the Equinoctiall, and that this Ellipsis is fitted to some one plain (which principally is the Horizontal plain (because that alone will shew all the houres of the day) or in some Horizontal position to the concave, or any such Diall) in its just position and alwayes with an upright Index, (that is, an Index perpendicular to the plain whereon it stands) which is not alwayes upright in respect of us, but only in respect of the plain) and with the houres also of the place. These things being so fitted, you may place your Body or Concave in the Sun, and turn it about till you discern that both kindes of Dials do agree to shew one houre, which when they do, then all stand right in their true situation, which will never else happen but only when the houres do in both agree.&mdash;To this place is referred the Double Horizon|tal Diall, the one of them giving the houre by the Axis, the other by the upright Index.&mdash;And here it must be noted, that the worst time of the day for this setting the Dials in a true position, is at the neerest to noon, and the best time is about the Suns b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing in the East and West Azimuth.</P>
<P N="3">3. This kinde of Diall may be placed (in a moveable
<PB N="36" REF="22">
posture) before a casement in any window that hath a flat board upon which it may move. And the Index to it may be an upright threed (precisely upright it must be) that is fixed at the top and bottome of the window, to and from which the Ellipsis must move in a Meridian line that is drawn upon the board of the window, &amp; from or justly even upon the threed.&mdash;And where I say the window must be flat, it is to be understood that there is no extraordinary ex|actnesse required in that. For if it should rise or incline 5 <HI>gr.</HI> to the Horizon, it would not erre one minute of time about our Latitude; provided that the Meridian be truly drawn, and the Index perfectly upright, in which all possible exact|nesse is required.</P>
<P N="4">4. If any choise plain reclining, or however situated plain that shall represent the Horizon of some notable place, be fixed as a Base whereon to place such a Diall thus fitted, and drawn to the proper houres of that same place: this double Diall being placed upon that Base, and turned about there|on, will shew the true houre at that place when both of them do agree, and the Meridian of it will shew how the proper Meridian of that place is to be placed, and which way drawn.</P>
<P N="5">5. If such a Recliner (or Incliner, or Erect) shall be fur|nished with such a double Diall to some intended Declinati|on, though they stand and be framed properly to the plain in respect (chiefly) of the upright Index, and shall (notwith|standing) have the proper houres of the place upon both Dials: and if further such a Recliner as was mentioned, have an horizontal base, upon which it may be turned round: I say, though this Body be horizontally moveable, and may be turned any way, yet the two Dials will never agree
<PB N="37" REF="22">
to shew the same houre, untill the Base stand to the true Declination to which the double Diall was drawn.</P>
</DIV2>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. V. Some varieties of the structure of it do here follow.</HEAD>
<P>_FIrst, Instead of the Ellipsis drawn to the proper Meridian and Latitude of the plain, there may be used a true Circle equally divided: but then let these things be observed.</P>
<P>First, That the Index must be perpendicular every way to the plain on which the Circle is elevated, standing upright upon it. Secondly, That the motion (either of Index or Circle) must be according to the proper Meridian of the plain. Thirdly, That the Zodiac must also be proper to the plain, and must lie upon the plain or Base it selfe, and must be the same with that which should serve for the El|lipsis. But then, Fourthly, this equally divided Circle must be elevated over the proper Meridian of the plain (that is, the Base of it must rest upon the proper East and West line of the plain) so much it must be elevated as the elevati|on of the Equinoctiall above that plain comes unto. And the elevation of it may be either way; that is, either upon the South Coast, and then it will be answerable to the Equi|noctiall in the heavens; or else it may be towards the North, but still so much as the Equinoctials (not the Poles) elevati|on comes unto, and in some cases it must be done both
<PB N="38" REF="23">
wayes that the Sun may come at it, and it must then have two Indexes. Both wayes it is alike true. It must be di|vided into equall houres and parts, and so much of it must stand above the Base or plain on which it moves, as the long|est day comes unto. The beginning of the division must be from the line of 12, and if the plain be not direct, then must the difference of Longitude be counted in the circular de|grees, from the highest point, or from the Verticall line of this Equinoctiall Circle.</P>
<P N="2">2. This Diall is not so tyed to a plain, but that it may also be brought to an un-even Superficies, yet so, that the motion of it, or the Zodiacal Scale must be upon some plain. But to shew the manner how this should be performed, is more proper for those Projecting wayes which I have in ano|ther place had some assayes of. Only remember that the Horizontal Diall must be projected, not by the Axis, but by the Zenith.</P>
<P N="3">3. A double Diall depending upon this kinde, may be made to set it selfe, and to shew the houre in a Craticular forme, which is also more properly to be handled in my other wayes.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>There remains yet one structure more, by which it is fitted for some uses that follow after, and is made a portable Instrument, not at all to be used in observation.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. MAke a right angled Parallelogram, as A B C D, whose length may be about three times the breadth: and let the limbe (upon which the graduations stand) be high|er then the Plain or Area of it.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="23"><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P N="2">2. Describe a Semiellipsis to your own Latitude, whose longest Radius let be M O, a little longer than A B, that when the center M is left out and cut off, so much as M N comes to (which may be about halfe a quarter of an houre from 12 in the Ellipsis) the remaining breadth N O, or E F, or G H, may be just fit to A B the breadth of the hol|low Area, in which this lesser rectangled Parallelogram E F G H may be moved to and fro as there shall be occasion. And let the thicknesse or depth of this moving plate be the
<PB N="40" REF="24">
same with the thicknesse of the limbe of the lower plate. The division of the Ellipsis may be made according to the rules before given.</P>
<P N="3">3. In the midst of this lesser plate, let a hole be pierced quite through it; and in that hole let a threed be extended, as I K, which is to serve for an Index, by which the said Semiellipsis is to be rectified. And therefore it is best that the threed I K be laid just in the longer diameter, which is the 6 a clock line.</P>
<P N="4">4. Take the lesser Parallelogram and put it into its place, as close to the end A B as it will go, and when it is there laid, observe where the threed lies upon the lower Area, and draw the line upon which it lies, which must be the line 90, 90; upon which the Scales (that are inscribed) must take their beginning. And likewise you are to take the longer Radius O M, and as the plate there lies, set one foot of that Radius upon O, and let the other reach as far as it will, which must be upon the rising limbe beyond the inner edge of it, so much as M N comes to: in that point you are to make one center: so again, turning your lesser plate about, you must lay it in the contrary way, close to A B, as you did before, and from the point O you may finde the second center: both these centers (in each of which must a threed be fastned) will happen to fall in the former line 90, and 90, neer the points T and V.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Being thus far prepared, you may take away the lesser plate, and divide the Scales upon the greater plate, in this manner.</HEAD>
<P N="5">5. First, For the two limbs of it, they are nothing else
<PB N="41" REF="24">
but the degrees of a Circle projected thereon from the two centers: which may therefore without difficulty be done either from the degrees of a Circle, or else by Tangent lines, as any man will easily perceive.</P>
<P N="6">6. Secondly, For the other Scales you must make them parallel to the edge of the limbs. There are three of them in number: The longest is a Scale of Tangents: The mid|dlemost is a Scale of houres, made in the form of a line of Sines: The third is a Zodiac, or Scale of the year.</P>
<P>The Tangents are made thus. Taking M O as Radius, finde the Co-sine of your Latitude agreeable thereto: and making that Co-sine as a Radius, or Tangent of 45 degrees, all the other Tangents are to be fitted accordingly. Then to know how far of this line will be usefull, put the lesser plate again into its place, as close to the end C D as it will go, so shall the threed I K shew the furthest point of it that will be usefull.</P>
<P>The middle Scale of Sines is made thus. Count the com|plement of your Latitude upon the new made Tangent line, and from the beginning of the Scale to that point, make a line of Sines for six houres and their quarters, so shall this Scale be fitted.</P>
<P>The Zodiac or Annual Scale is equall in length to the Tangent of 23 <HI>gr.</HI> 30 <HI>min.</HI> and the manner of inscription with Tables whereby to do it, are set down before, and need not be here repeated.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The reason why this Instrument is thus contrived.</HEAD>
<P>The intent of the contrivance is, that it should shew both Azimuth and houre, and that therefore there should be a Ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> and an Ellipsis sliding over it, both of them made to
<PB N="42" REF="25">
one center, so that the center should be in the midst, and the Circle should be a whole entire Circle, and the Ellipsis also whole. But because the Ellipsis sliding upon the nether plain, doth somtimes of necessity cover the center, so as that there can be no threed fixed for use, I was therefore com|pelled to order it in this manner that is before exprest, that the motion of the upper plate and the centers migh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> stand cleere without hin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing each other.</P>
<P>Then further it must be noted, that the Instrument is (not generall to all, but) particular to one La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tude.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The uses of it do here follow, which by reason of the Semi|ellipsis will not be so easie, because many changes are required. In generall note thus much.</HEAD>

<ITEM>1. In using this Instrument you must alwayes suppose that you looke upon the North.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. If the Declination of the Sun or Star be North, hold A B towards you. If South, then hold C D towards you.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. If the Sun or Star be Eastward of the Meridian, let the morning houres be towards you. If they be Westward, let the evening houres be towards you.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Alwayes use that threed which is on the same side with the center of the Ellipsis. And that side lin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the larger plate is ever to be taken for the Meridian, and con|sequently the other side must be esteemed for one of the two Coasts of East or West.</ITEM>

<P>These cautions being observed, the conclusions that are to be wrought will be easie.</P>
</DIV2>

<PB N="43" REF="25">
<HEAD>1. By having the Azimuth to finde the Houre.</HEAD>
<P>First, Order your Instrument by the former cautions, according to the present case of your observation. And re|ctifie the upper <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">late (by help of the threed Index) either to the Declination of the Star, counted in the Tangent line, or to the Suns place in the Zodiac. Then count the Azimuth given upon the right quarter of the limbe, and apply the threed thereto: So shall the threed shew (upon the Ellipsis) the houre in which the Sun or Star is.</P>
<P>If the work be for the Sun, then the houre thus shewed is the Suns houre, or houre of the day.</P>
<P>If the work be for a Star, it then shews the Stars houre only; which must afterwards be reduced into the Suns houre, that it may be the true houre of the night. This change may most easilie be done by a common Nocturnall.</P>

<P>The upper plate therefore being rectified, either to the Suns place, or to the Stars Declination, the threed will shew upon the middle Scale, the Ascensionall difference, if you count the houres how many they are from 6. It shews the Seminocturnall arks, by the houres of setting and rising be|ing rightly taken according to the condition of North or South declination. It shews the time of Sun rising and setting, according to the houres upon which it lies. But for the Stars, it shews only upon what houre-circles they rise and set; but the true houre or time thereof must be found by turning the Stars houre into the Suns houre, which (as I said before) will be done with most ease by an ordinary Nocturnall, in which the Stars (that you deal with) are placed.</P>

<HEAD>Note here.</HEAD>
<P>In the first of these Propositions I suppose the Azimuth, in the second I suppose the Houre to be given by observati|on. For the observing of these two, you may make in any convenient window, both an Horizontall Diall, with a threed Axis lying in the Axis of the world, and an Azimuth Cir|cle with a threed Axis, standing upright in the Zenith line. The divisions sutable to both these, may be inscribed upon the board of the window; and for the Sun, the shadow of the threed will give the houre of it upon the Horizontall Diall; or the Azimuth upon the Azimuthall Circle. But for the Stars that cast no shadows, you may make sliding sights, that may move upon the edge of the window board, or may be upon the bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rd it selfe, (which must in these re|spects be level, or at least neer to it.) And those moving sights must be furnished with short wires or pins which may best stand upon the edge of the sight, and go down to the window board, and to the divisions that are drawn upon it, which may be both for sights by which to looke at the standing Index and Star both together, and must serve as Indexes to shew the houre or Azimuth on which a Star is at any time. Only this generall caution must be given, that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">se pins be set parallel to the threed Axis that is set in the window (that is) for the Azimuths they must stand upright, but for the houre they must lie aslope, parallel to the Axis of the world. This I have sometimes done, and this any man may at his pleasure do, whereby either the Houre or A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">muth may be observed, and when any one of them is

<P>The meaning is to know how many degrees are intercep|ted between the Meridian line, and any other houre line. There are two wayes to do it. The first is the converse of the making of the Instrument.

<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>A lesser Ellipsis (I say) must be described, which though it be lesse, yet it must be like and propor|tionall to the former.</P>
<P>Therefore assuming any length as M P, for the longer Radius, you must (to that Radius) make M R and M S equall<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the Sine of your Latitude, and so describe and divide it as formerly was ordered.</P>
<P>Then again, to this new Ellipsis there must a new Scale of Tangents be made, whose length must be limited as the former was, in this manner. To M P as Radius, finde the Co-sine of your Latitude, and make that Co-sine a Radius or Tangent of 45 <HI>gr.</HI> and according thereunto, continue the Scale of Tangents as far as it will go. It must begin upon the same line that the other Scale of Tangents began, and must go the same way with it. And in this new way of ordering the Scales and the Ellipses, it must be conside|red what the other parts of the Instrument do signifie</P>
<P>The end of the lower plate, upon which the Scales be|gin, must be accounted for the North, the other end C D is to be taken for South. The side lines are the Meridian. The degrees of the limbs are to be used as the degrees of
<PB N="50" REF="29">
the Equinoctiall. The threed applyed to those degrees are the Meridians comming from the Centers, which are the North Pole. The Tangents are the degrees of Altitude. The Ellipsis notes out that Almicantar which the threed Index stands unto upon the Tangent Scale.</P>
<P>And further. It is to be here noted, that if the Meridians (or threeds comming from the center) were rightly divided, those divisions or parts of it should signifie the degrees of Declination from the Equinoctiall. But the inconvenience of it is, that because one Ellipsis is to represent every Almi|cantar, therefore the Radius cannot possibly be at all times the same in length, but must varie according to the removing or severall positions of the said Ellipsis. That is, when the Ellipsis signifies the Horizon (or stands at the beginning of the Scales, without any altitude at all) then the Radius M O in the first moving plate, or M P in the second moving plate, is the Scale of Declinations, but at other times, when the Ellipsis signifies any Almicantar, then must the Secant of that Almicantar (of Altitude) be taken as the Radius for that particular work. But alwayes the Radius (of what length soever it be) must be divided as a whole line of Sines, the greatest parts beginning towards the center, the least parts ending at the remotest end from the center, and yet then a|gain, the numeration of the parts or declinations of it must begin at the remotest end, and must end in the center at the Pole.</P>
<P>It might be applyed to use in the motions of the Stars, but that would be troublesome; therefore it shall suffice to make it usefull only for the Sun.</P>
<P>The best way that (for the present) I know whereby to divide this Radius (thus of severall lengths) is this. Divide the length from the center T to C into 90 Sines (the
<PB N="51" REF="29">
greatest parts beginning at the center, but numbered the contrary way.) This line may be drawn from the center T into some part of the limbe, where it may have room to re|ceive divisions. Then with your Compasses take the Ra|dius T V, equall to M O, and from the end of the former Scale, open the threed to the least distance, and where the threed stayes, there make a mark upon the limbe V D, for there is a new Scale to begin, for the Secants that were men|tioned before.</P>
<P>Then lay the threed from T to 80 in the opposite limb, and move the Ellipsis till the point O fall just under the threed, and take T O in your Compasses, and put in that distance as before, so shall you put in 10 <HI>gr.</HI> into this new Scale. In like manner lay the threed to 70, 60, &amp;c. and bring the Ellipsis till the point O lies under it, so shall T O (in these severall positions) give the lengths to be inscribed in this new Scale, for 20 <HI>gr.</HI> and 30 <HI>gr. &amp;c.</HI> all the rest must be done in like manner, till you have put in as many as will come within the reach of the limb, which will be upon 60 <HI>gr.</HI> or thereabout.</P>
<P>The like should also be done for the lesser Ellipsis, work|ing in the same manner by the threed and the point P. These are called the new inscribed Scales.</P>
<P>The former line of Sines serves to them both indiffe|rently.</P>
<P>Now when things are thus fitted, the uses of them will be such as in particular Astrolabes is vulgarly known.</P>
<P><HI>Some of the Uses are here mentioned.</HI></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="52" REF="30">
<HEAD>1. Having the Suns Declination and Alti|tude to finde the Houre and Azimuth.</HEAD>
<P>First, For North Declinations. Set the Ellipsis to the Altitude counted in the Tangent Scale. Then count the same Altitude in the new inscribed Scale of Secants, and thereto lay the threed. Afterwards, take the least distance from the Suns declination, (counted in the fore-mentioned inscribed Scale of Sines) to the threed. Set one foot of that distance in the center, and extend the other till it crosse the Ellipsis, and where it crosseth, thither apply the threed, which (in the limb) will shew the Houre and scruple (in de|grees) required. The same point of the Compasses doth also immediately shew (upon the Ellipsis) the Azimuth sought for. If the Compasses do crosse the Ellipsis twice (as somtimes it will) take that crossing that is furthest from the Meridian.</P>
<P>Secondly, for South declinations. The work is in a man|ner the same: only you must note that the threed will crosse the Ellipsis twice, and you are in this case to take that cros|sing which is neerest to the Meridian.</P>
<P>By supposing the Altitude to be 00, that is, by laying the Ellipsis upon the line T V, and using the Declination as before, you may finde both the Amplitude and Ascen|sionall difference as before, and what else doth thereon depend.</P>
<P>But because these things being done neer the Horizon, will not prove good, especially when the Declina|tion is little from the Equinoctiall: and because the work at the best is but troublesome, I shall here break off, supposing that I have already written too much.</P>

<HEAD>A DEMONSTRATION of the Ellipticall Diall upon an Hori|zontall Plain: shewing the reason why the same Diall, by an upright Index should shew the true Houre.</HEAD>
<P>_THE reason is principally deduced from the Sphere it self: and secondly, from the <HI>Or|thographicall</HI> Projection of the Sphere up|on the plain of the Horizon; which as it doth represent the Sphere it selfe, so it doth perform the same conclusions with the like certainty that the Sphere doth; and that upon this generall ground, that looke what Circles, and in what parts they cut each other upon the former, the same Circles and the same parts of those Circles do upon this latter cut each other in the same manner. I shall here take for granted, that the Projecture is (for truth) in all respects answerable to the Sphere it selfe, which is abundantly made good by those that have treated upon this subject. Then from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s Pro|jection I shall shew how the Ellipticall Diall upon the Hori|zon must be of the same truth with it. And therefore these things following must be considered, as so many Lemmaes to prove what is here required.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="31"><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Note, that in no form of Projection besides the Or|thographicall, this kinde of Diall can be true; that is, that no figure but an Ellipsis will do it, nor yet all Ellipses, or Ellipses divided into all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, as in some Projections the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="lemma">
<HEAD>LEMMA I.</HEAD>
<P>First, <HI>The Equinoctiall Circle, and all the Parallels of Declination, are projected upon the plain of the Horizon into like Ellipses. And that they are all of them divided (by the Meridians) alike or proportionally one to the other.</HI></P>
<P>The reason of this may be conceived upon this ground. Since the Equinoctiall and all the Parallels are Circles of a just parallel situation one to the other (as their name imports:) therefore on what point soever of the horizontall Axis the eye is placed, the said Circles must be Ellipses (excepting only if the eye be placed upon the superficies of the Sphere, for then, and only then, they will be all perfect Circles,) as all that write upon this subject do sufficiently make good: and consequently, when the eye is placed upon the same Ax|is, in an infinite distance, as this Projection supposeth. But the second thing is more to our purpose, and that is, that all their degrees and quarters, and other like parts, art like and proportionall one to the other (not all the parts of one and the same Ellipsis are like, that is equall, one to the other, as in the Circles themselves upon the Sphere they are, but each one of these Ellipses is justly like any other of them, both in the whole, and likewise when any of the like parts of one be compared with the like parts of the other, as one quarter, &amp;c. with another.) And the reason briefly is, be|cause the eye is supposed (in this Orthographical Projection)
<PB N="56" REF="32">
to stand in an infinite distance from the plain on which the projection is made; and because it doeh stand in an infinite distance, therefore all these Circles are alike situated to the eye, and consequently must make a like or proportionall Projection of every of those parallels with their like situa|ted parts. But if the eye should stand at a finite distance, then these parallels would not have a like situation to the eye, neither in respect of distance, nor in respect of position, and so the like parts of the parallels could not be like one to the other in the Projection, because of their different positi|on. But in the Orthographicall Projection at an infinite distance all things will be alike, being alike projected from a like position. I say in this it will be so, and in none besides this.</P>
<DIV4 TYPE="corollary">
<HEAD>COROLLARY.</HEAD>
<P>Whence will follow: <HI>That the Equinoctiall Circle, or Ellipsis rather, may represent both it selfe, and likewise any other of the Parallels, if it be so contrived to stand from the Zenith point, as that it may have a propor|tionall situation from it, suiting with the position of any other Parallel which it is to represent.</HI> And this is the main ground upon which this Diall will be proved to be true.</P>
</DIV4>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="lemma">
<HEAD>LEMMA II.</HEAD>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Any two like plain Figures may be alike situated. to any point assigned; so as that from that point any two right lines being drawn infinitely, shall cut proportionall parts from those two like figures.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="32">This is generall to all like figures, whether they be two or more; plain or solid: but for our purpose it will be enough to shew it to be true in like Ellip|ses. One way for the making of one Ellipsis like to another, is by assuming of any point, as <HI>a</HI> in the greater Ellipsis, and from thence drawing as many lines as you wil, as <HI>a b, a c,</HI> you must divide them into proportio|nall parts at <HI>d</HI> &amp; <HI>e,</HI> that as <HI>a b</HI> to <HI>a d</HI>; so <HI>a c</HI> to <HI>a e:</HI> &amp; then through those points the lesser Ellipsis may be drawn, which must be like to the great|er&punc; and alike situated to the point <HI>a,</HI> because all those lines are proportionall, and the subtenses <HI>b c, d e,</HI> will likewise be parallel and proportionall. And if the lines <HI>a b, a c,</HI> had been augmented proportionally (as here they were dimi|nished) there would have been a greater Ellipsis described, like to the other.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<DIV4 TYPE="corollary">
<PB N="58" REF="33">
<HEAD>COROLLARY.</HEAD>
<P>Hence will follow&punc; <HI>That if the centers of two like Ellipses be laid upon one line, as upon one of their common Diameters, and from any point assigned (unto which they are to be alike situated) there be an infinite line drawn to any point of one of the Ellipses, and the like point of the other Ellipsis be brought to that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">finite line (the center of it still keeping upon the common Diameter,) those Ellipses in that situation shall stand alike posited to the assigned point.</HI></P>
<P>Because there are two lines (the common diameter and the infinite line) that from the point assigned do cut like parts of both Ellipses. The common diameter makes them alike situate in respect of one dimension (suppose the length) of the <HI>locus planus</HI> whereon they lie, and the infinite line limits them in respect of the other dimension (suppose the breadth) of the same <HI>locus planus.</HI> So that they are quite limited in respect of their like situation to the point, and can (in this respect) lie in no other place for this individuall position.</P>
</DIV4>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="lemma">
<HEAD>LEMMA III.</HEAD>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>All the Azimuths of the Horizon are (in this Orthographicall Projection) cast into streight lines meeting all in the Zenith point.</HI></P>
<P>The reason is, because all these Circles do crosse each other upon the Axis of the Horizon (or upon the Zenith line,) upon which line the eye is imagined to be placed at an infinite distance. Therefore they all (that is, the plains of
<PB N="59" REF="33">
them infinitely continued) do crosse through the eye, and consequently must all be projected into streight lines. And their concourse being upon the Zenith line, and the same Zenith line comming into the eye, the said whole line, and their whole concourse will be cast or resolved into one single point, answering to the Zenith point of the Sphere.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The application of these things to the purpose intended.</HEAD>
<P>First, In the Projection it selfe we are to consider these things.</P>
<P>If it be furnished with parallels and houres, as the man|ner is, and laid horizontally with the Meridian line of it just North and South: and if further, there be an upright In|dex set in the Zenith point at Z, then shall the shadow of that erect Index represent the Azimuth in which the Sun is, and if you note where it cuts the Parallel wherein the Sun (for that day) is, the same shadow will shew (among the houres of that parallel) the time of the day.</P>
<P>This conclusion is true upon any Horizontal Projection (the Stereographicall as well as the Orthographicall) for the streight lines or Azimuths whether shadow or Index com|ming from the Zenith, and cutting through any houre in any parallel, doth shew the Azimuth in which the Sun must be at that houre for the day of that parallel.</P>
<P>And further, because all the Projection is made upon the plain of the Horizon (which therefore must be the funda|mentall Circle of the Projection, and) which for that cause is, and must be (as all fundamental Circles of any Projection are) equally divided; Therefore an upright Index standing
<PB N="60" REF="34">
in Z the center of it, and so answering to the Zenith line of the Sphere, and the degrees of the Horizontall Circle an|swering to the degrees of the Horizon in the Sphere. I say the shadow of that Index doth really shew the true Azimuths of the Sun, or the true angles of position that the Sun at any time maketh with the Meridian line. And further, the same shadow or Azimuth where it crosseth the Parallel of the day (which Parallel is divided into its proper parts, like to the parts of the Equinoctiall, by the Meridian Circles issu|ing out of the Poles) it notes out also the houre of the day.</P>
<P>So that the Projection made in this manner with an up|right Index and divided Parallels, will (by the shadow of that Index) shew the true houre of the day upon that parallel that is proper for the day, if the Meridian of the Projection lie in the true Meridian of the Horizon.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The next thing to be shewed, is how the Ellipticall Equino|ctiall may supply the use of all the Parallels.</HEAD>
<P>That is to say, How the Equinoctiall, being made mova|able, and the Index standing alwayes still, may be fitted to represent any of the Suns parallels. And because (as was said before) it is every way like to each of the Parallels, it will therefore be only required to give some rule how the said Equinoctiall may be at any time placed in a like positi|on to the Zenith point at <HI>Z,</HI> that any parallel hath to the same point, so as that any right line (or Azimuth) being drawn from thence may cut a like part or point in the Equi|noctiall that it doth in the Parallel.</P>
<P>Let the Parallel be H E, I would remove the Equinocti|all Ae A so, as that it might have a like position to the point <HI>Z,</HI> that the Parallel H E hath.</P>
<P>By the <HI>Corollary</HI> of the first <HI>Lemma,</HI> it may represent it. By the <HI>Corollary</HI> of the second <HI>Lemma,</HI> the way of it will be
<PB N="61" REF="34">
easie. For first, the two Ellipses H E and Ae A, have their centers upon the Meridian line Ae H <HI>Z</HI> P, as upon one of their common Diameters. Secondly, the Parallel H E cuts the six a clock Circle, or Meridian P E A, in the point E, making E A equall in radiall degrees to H Ae (for the Parallel is every where equidistant to the Equator, and the Meridional Arks, therefore, intercepted between them, such as are E A and H Ae, must be equall.) So that E A is the Declination of that Parallel from the Equinoctiall. If therefore the line (or Azimuth) <HI>Z</HI> E be drawn infinitely through the point of 6 in the Parallel, or through the Declination (of that Pa|rallel) counted in the Circle of six; and then the Equinocti|all (still keeping its center upon the common Diameter Ae P) be slipped up till the point A thereof do concur with the in|finite line (drawn before) at G; in thus doing, I say that the Equinoctiall is in a like situation to the point <HI>Z,</HI> that the Pa|rallel H E is in, to the same point. And consequently, that any right line (or Azimuth) from <HI>Z,</HI> will cut the same (rather like) parts in one that it doth in the other. As by the <HI>Corol|lary</HI> of the second <HI>Lemma</HI> will appear.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The next thing to be enquired is, what the line A G is, or how it must be found and estimated.</HEAD>
<P>For this purpose, consider, that <HI>Z</HI> P E and <HI>Z</HI> C O are two Triangles rectangled at P and C, and having a common an|gle at <HI>Z</HI>; therefore, As <HI>Z</HI> P Co-sine of the Latitude, to <HI>Z</HI> C the Radius; So P E, the Co-tangent of the Declination, to the Tangent of C O. Or, As the Radius <HI>Z</HI> C, to the Co-sine of the Latitude <HI>Z</HI> P; so is the Tangent of E A, the Pa|rallels Declination, to the Tangent of A O, that is, to the line A G, which is the Tangent of A O, because the arke A O is expressed in its full quantity&punc; without any en|larging or fore-shortning, and the right line A G stands
<PB N="62" REF="35">
to it as a Tangent thereof, standing at the end of the Radius Z A. Now consider, that if Z C be considered as Radius, then must the Tangent of E A be the Tangent of the Pa|rellels declination, estimated to the same Radius. And be|cause Z P is in the selfe same proportion to A C, therefore: If Z P (the Co-sine of the Latitude) be estimated for a Ra|dius, then must A G be esteemed as the Tangent (of this Parallels declination) to the said Radius Z P. And hence it will follow that</P>
<P>If <HI>Z</HI> P the Co-sine of the Latitude [being taken (as that Co-sine) to the Radius <HI>Z</HI> C or <HI>Z</HI> A, which is the longer Radius of the Ellipticall Equinoctiall] be counted as a Radius or Tangent of 45 <HI>gr.</HI> and so be divided and continued as occasion shall be, It is to be noted I say, That this Scale thus limited will be a right Scale for the requisite motion of the Ellipticall Equinoctiall to such a position in respect of the Ze|nith point, as that it may represent any parallel, whose Declination is known, if it be removed to the same Declination counted upon that Scale. And being set in that like posture, any Azimuth or shadow of the upright Index that would passe through any houre point of the Parallel, will also passe through the same point of the Equinoctiall, and so this one may serve for them all.</P>
<P>This gives the reason of making the Zodiac or Annuall Scale, mentioned in the former Treatise, I say it gives the reason of the second way mentioned for lesser Latitudes. For if either the Signes of the Zodiac, or the moneths of the year be put in according to their declinations taken in this
<PB N="63" REF="35">
Scale, it will be all one to set your Ellipsis to the Signe or Moneth, that it is to set it to the Declination, since they are made one to answer to the other.</P>
<P>Then for the first way for greater Latitudes: because,</P>
<P>As the Co-sine of the Latitude, Is to the Sine of the Latitude;</P>
<P>So the Radius, (or Tangent of 45 <HI>gr.</HI>) To the Tangent of the Latitude.</P>
<P>You see that if you divide the Co-sine of your Latitude into 45 Tangents; or the Sine of your Latitude into the Tangent of your Latitude, the Scale will be all one accor|ding to the former proportion.</P>
<P>What is before spoken of North Parallels of Declinati|on, is the same in South also, and one Scale (for the kinde of it) serves both; only in North Declinations the Equi|noctiall goes neerer to the Zenith point, in South it goes further of.</P>
<P>All other Scales annexed to the Ellipsis have their de|pendance wholly upon this Scale of Declinations, and will not need any further explication in this place.</P>
<P>Then again, it matters not where the little Scale or Zo|diac stands, so that it give the just quantity of removall for the Equinoctiall Ellipsis.</P>
<P>And so also, it is no matter whether the Index move, and the Equinoctiall stand, or contrarily: It is only required that their situation be such as may make the foot of the In|dex stand in a proportionall position to the station of the Parallel, as was formerly shewed.</P>
<P>Further. For the circular year or Zodiac, the ground of it is thus. The Circle is supposed to be divided into equall
<PB N="64" REF="36">
parts or degrees: and so every Sine (as is D F) is a proper Sine to any arke (as D C) to which it is annexed. Again, A B in another con|sideration is to be e|steemed (as formerly for the Semidiameter of the Circle, so now again) for the Tan|gent of 23&frac12; degrees, whence this propor|tion will stand:</P>
<P>As the Radius A B, Is to the Sine F D; So the same A B, tan|gent of 23&frac12;&punc; To the Tangent A E. Which is the Tange~t belonging to the Right Ascension C D.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>[Because in the Sphere, As the Radius,</P>
<P>To the Sine of any Right Ascension, So the Tangent of 23&frac12;</P>
<P>To the Tangent of the Declination answering to that Right Ascension.]</P>
<P>If therefore you have the Right Ascension belonging to any day, and put it into the Circle of equall degrees, as C D here is, the Sine of that Right Ascension, <HI>viz.</HI> F D, will be equall to A E the Tangent belonging to that Right Ascen|sion, if B A be taken for the Tangent of 23&frac12; <HI>gr.</HI> So that this way of putting in Moneths and Signes is the same in
<PB N="65" REF="36">
effect with the former Zodiac or Annuall course of the Sun.</P>
<P>Thus far for demonstration of what was hard in the first Section, <HI>Pag.</HI> 8, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> concerning Horizontall plains.</P>
<P>What is added more in the first Section of framing it to other plains that are direct, is the same with this.

The distinction is, because they are made to ano|ther Meridian than is their own, that is, to the Meridian of the place, and all the account of houres is deduced from it. The difference therefore of these from the former, is only this, that the houres in the Ellipsis are not evenly fitted to the quarters or diameters of the Ellipsis, but fall to stand as casually they may. Now if in the former case of Horizon|ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l plains, you do but suppose the Equinoctiall and Paral|lels to be divided from any casuall Meridian as P M (not P Ae) into houres and parts, then will follow still the same things in substance that was before. Namely, That if the Equinoctiall Circle be removed according to A G (which
<PB N="66" REF="37">
must be supposed to be suited to the Latitude of the place as well as to the Suns parallel of declination) with those divisions now spoken of, then still, when the Equinoctiall by that motion hath got a like situation to the Parallel, the parts of one will be answerable to the parts of the other, in respect of the shadows or Azimuths that are cast from the Zenith point and upright Index standing in it at <HI>Z.</HI> So that even in these plains also, the same houre will be shewed by the Equinoctiall that would be by the Parallel.

<P>FOr the varieties it must be known, that the substance is the same with that which went before, which being well understood will give light enough to this.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="37">But in this <HI>Section</HI> there is mention made of a Circle (in|steed of the Horizontall Ellipsis) elevated to the height of the Equinoctiall. The reason of that will best be seen out of the Sphere it selfe, For there we know, that the Equino|ctiall and all the Parallels to it are both equally divided, and equally elevated, and so being all alike, the Equinoctiall may supply the room of each and all of them. Only it must be required (whether the Index move toward the Cir|cle; or the Circle towards it) that this motion (if the Zodi|ac be upon the Horizontall plain) be limited by an Hori|zontall Zodiac, such as was used for the Ellipsis upon any plain, (which plain, what ever it be, I now count as an Ho|rizontall plain.) But if the Index be made to move upon the Equinoctiall (which though it do, yet it must still lie in the Zenith line, not perpendicular to the circular plain, but making an angle with it equall to the Latitude of the place, and not the Latitude of the plain.) If, I say, the Index be made to move upon the Equinoctiall plain, then must a new Scale be made like to that upon the Horizontal plain, but somewhat larger; that is, it must be augmented so as that the parts and whole of the Horizontall Scale, to the parts and whole of this Equinoctiall Scale; must be as the Radius, to the Co-secant of the Latitude. Or thus. Because, As the Radius, to the Co-secant of the Latitude; so the Sine of the Latitude to the Radius: and so again, the Co-sine of the Latitude, to the Co-tangent of the Latitude. Therefore, whereas on the Horizontall plain (for the Ellipsis thereon described) you looke the Co-sine of your Latitude, and make it a Radius or Tangent of 45 <HI>gr.</HI> you must in this take the Co-tangent of your Latitude, and make it a Radius or Decimall Scale; and by it you may put on the Zodiac or moneths as was prescribed before. This Co&punc;sine mentioned

before was taken to the greater Radius, of the Ellipsis, and so this Co-tangent here mentioned must be taken to the (same greater Radius of the Ellipsis, if the Ellipsis were here used, or to the) Radius of the Equinoctiall Circle, whose Radius must be conceived to be the same with the greater Radius of the Ellipsis. For from this Circle proje|cted Orthographically (that is, by perpendiculars let fall from the Periphery to the subjacent plain) is the Ellipsis de|duced, and from that Ellipsis (again) is this Circle raised or restored. And so the reason of this Circular Diall with an upright Index will be understood well enough.</P>
<P>Then whereas it is said that it makes no matter which way this Circle be raised, that is, whether toward North or South, there is no difficulty in this, for which way soever it is turned, if the plain and center of it lie in a just distance from the Index or Zenith line, the same Index must shew the same point or houre, because in both wayes they are situ|ated from it upon the same Coast.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VII. 1. How to draw and divide the Ellipsis upon any Plain, to an Index that stands upright (not to the Plain, but) to the Zenith line of the place, or perpendicular to the plain of the Horizon.</HEAD>
<P>_THis may be done artificially by calculation, or by a lineary way, but not without too much trouble and incumberance, which would deter any man quite from putting it in practise. I shall therefore let that way alone, and fall upon another more feasible and delightfull.</P>
<P>The way that I intend, is partly by projection of such lines as are usefull, and partly by inscription of such points as the Ellipticall line is to passe through, as shall be seen hereafter. And therefere we shall not need to looke after any position of the plain in respect of declination or leaning.</P>
<P>But first in generall note thus much; that the Ellipticall Diall cannot possibly be drawn upon any plain that lies pa|rallel to the Index. And consequently to these upright In|dexes there can no such Diall be made upon any upright plain. And therefore again to such an Index, it is requisite that the plain make some kinde of angle in respect of
<PB N="70" REF="40">

Reclination or Inclination from the Zenith line towards the Horizon, which position (notwithstanding) we shall have nothing to do withall in this way of working.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>2. The manner of the work.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. LEt the plain be A B C, and the upright Index A D. First then, assume any point in the Index as at E, and from thence (by the projecting Quadrant, or some Levell) cast an Horizontall levell line as F G upon the plain; or if it cannot be cast upon the plain it selfe, set any board (for a time) that may receive it; lying in the same Levell with the assigned point at E. And further, the same Horizontall line must be continued and returned about the point E, by help of threeds stretched out from some points or other of the Horizontall line before drawn, as from F or G, unto two supporters set up (for a while) for this purpose (either upon the plain or otherwise neer to it) as is to be seen at H and I: so that now the points H F G I are all in one and the same Horizontall levell to one another, and likewise to the first point of the Index assumed at E.</P>
<P N="2">2. At some convenient time of the day, when the Azi|muth may be found distinctly, observe where the shadow of the Index cutteth the Horizontall line, suppose at K, and there make a mark, and immediately take the Suns Al|titude.</P>
<P N="3">3. By the Suns Altitude observed, compute what Azi|muth the Sun was then in, which will tell you what Azi|muth the observed point K (in the Horizontall line) doth represent.</P>
<P N="4">4. Take a Pastboard as E L, and fit it to the Horizontall
<PB N="72" REF="41">
line of the plain F G, and to the assumed centerat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">: and applying it to its proper place (as in the figure is represented) draw a line from the point K to the center E, quite over the pastboard. And then knowing what Azim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">h it is, you may (from it) set off the Meridian in the true Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st of it, such as will be answerable to the heavens, which Meridian line suppose to be P E upon the Pastboard.</P>
<P N="5">5. You are next of all, from this Meridian line P E, to set of all the other houres of an Horizontall Diall (not the common Horizontall Diall, but) according to su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h num|bers or arks as are expressed in the Table of Angles, <HI>Pag.</HI> 29.) And when this is done upon the Pastboard, as you see done at o P <HI>q</HI> &kgr; <HI>s t u:</HI> Then,</P>
<P N="6">6. Apply the Pastboard to its former position upon the plain, and from the center E project the houres from the Pastboard to the Horizontall line and threeds. And then taking away your Pastboard, you may draw lines from A to such points as are in the Horizontall line i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> selfe, as A o, A <HI>p,</HI> A <HI>q,</HI> A &kgr;, A <HI>s,</HI> A <HI>t,</HI> A <HI>u.</HI> And for the others that stand not upon the Horizontall line of the plain, but upon the threeds which are separate from the plain (such as are &egr; &rgr; &pgr;) you may project them by the Index A D, reposing the same upon the said points (&egr; &rgr; &pgr;) of the threed; and marking where the shadow or appearance of the threed traceth the plain, there draw the lines A <HI>m,</HI> A <HI>n,</HI> A <HI>u.</HI> And so all the lines (that the plain is capable of) may be drawn. And it is to be noted, that these lines so drawn are not such houre lines as usually are upon other Dials, but they are those Azimuth lines in which the Sun is at every houre of the Equinoctiall Circle. So the houres and quarters may be put in by the Table, <HI>Pag.</HI> 29, and the Column of Angles in the same Table.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="41"><FIGURE>

<P N="7">7. Looke again into the Table <HI>Pag.</HI> 29, for the Column of Altitudes; for by that must the Ellipsis it selfe be desc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ibed, for the former Azimuthall-ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es will give it the true divisions into its re|quisite parts.

And let the Scale be of a fit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ignes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e for your plain, which your own judgement must direct you to do. Out of this Scale (setting alwayes one foot of your Compasses in the point of 90) take such Altitudes as are (in the Table) appropriated to every houre, and put them into those severall houres in this wise. Suppose the altitude for 12 a clock were to be put in, which altitude is 38 <HI>gr.</HI> 30 <HI>min.</HI> with my Compasses I take (in this Scale of Sines) from 90 to 38 <HI>gr.</HI> 30 <HI>min.</HI> and one foot of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t length I put into the line of 12, namely P A upon the plain, and (alwayes keeping it upon some part of that line) I remove it thereon, neerer to, or further from the center A, till the other foot of the Compasses being turned about will justly touch the edge (or fiduciall line) of the Index. Then I diligently observe where, or in what point of the line P A the first foot of my Compasses stayeth, for that is the point through which the Ellipsis must passe upon the houre-line of 12. So for any other houre (and the intermediate quarters) taking their altitudes, (set down in the Table) out of the same Scale of Sines, and inserting them in the same manner as was shewed before, you shall finde all the points (for eve|ry houre and quarter) through which the Ellipsis is to be drawn. Through these points therefore you must draw it carefully, as one continued line, without any breaches or an|gles in it.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="74" REF="42">
<HEAD>3. Concerning the motion that is to be made either by the Index, or by the Ellipsis it selfe.</HEAD>
<P>THe motion must be made according to the 12 a clock line, which is alwayes the proper Meridian to the In|dex or Zenith line. That is, the removall or sliding must be either in the Meridian it selfe, or else parallel to it.</P>
<P>Now if the Diall it selfe be made to slide upon the plain, that is, if the Ellipsis be to be described upon another plate that s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">all slip over the former plain, then must this plate be first of all laid fast upon the plain, and the houres and Ellip|ticall line must be described thereon in the same manner that was shewed before. And this plate must move in the Meri|dian line, that is, the 12 a clock line of the plate (being ima|gined to be continued forth right) must move through the fiduciall edge of the Index.</P>
<P>And so again, If the Diall be drawn upon the plain it self, and the Index be made to move (the Diall it selfe standing still) then must care be had that the fiduciall edge of the In|dex do precisely move in the Meridian or 12 a clock line, and that the same Index move alwayes precisely upright in the Zenith line.</P>

<HEAD>4. Concerning the Place of the Suns Annuall course or Zodiac.</HEAD>
<P>THe place of it may be best upon the plain. It must stand (if it be inscribed into a streight line) parallel to the line of 12, and needs not to be in or upon the said line. The mover (whether plate or Index) must have another peculiar

</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>5. Of what limitation or length the Zodiac must be, and how to be described, and where to be set.</HEAD>
<P>IT must be regulated by the former Scale of Sines mentio|ned <HI>Pag.</HI> 73. For you may take from 90 (in that Scale) to the number of the Latitude of your place (not comple|ment as that Scale is numbered) and count that length as a new Radius. Unto th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s new Radius finde the Secant of the Meridians inclination (which what it is shall be presently shewed in the 6 <HI>Proposition</HI> following) and then make this Secant to be a Tangent of 45 <HI>gr.</HI> and out of that Scale of Tangents take 23&frac12; <HI>gr.</HI> for that length being set both wayes from the Equinoctiall, will give the length of the Zodiac (in a streight line, or the Diameter of the Zodiac put into a Circle:) this work is to be understood for the describing of the Zodiacall Scale upon the plain it selfe. But first, you are to pitch the Equinoctials place, which is that place only upon which the Zodiacall Index lyeth, when the mover (whether plate or Index) is placed in the same position that it had when the Ellipticall line was described. Now when this Tangent of 45 <HI>gr.</HI> is thus found, you may take the De|clinations (in the Tables of the 4 and 5 <HI>Pages:</HI>) out of it, and so prick on the Suns yearly course. Or else make the
<PB N="76" REF="43">
forementioned Secant a Decimall Scale, and out of it take the Tangents noted in the Tables <HI>Pag.</HI> 6, 7. So shall you make the same Annuall course of the Sun that was produced the former way.</P>
<P>Note, that if the Index be made to move, it is not neces|sary that it should move upon or parallel to the superficies of the plain, but may be made to move either horizontall, or at any other inclination: only the fiduciall edge must necessarily be made to move in the very Meridian line, and must also be (in all motions) alwayes upright, or in the Ze|nith line of the place; and therefore must slide just under the Meridian line.</P>
<P>Note also, That the Zodiac though it be not necessarily confined to be set upon the superficies of the plain, yet it will be most conveniently limited thereunto.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>6. What the Meridians inclination meaneth, and how to finde the quantity of it.</HEAD>
<P>BY the Meridians inclination is meant what angle the same line maketh with the plain of the Horizon, and in the former figure <HI>Pag.</HI> 70 it is expressed by the complement of the angle D A P, or the excesse of it. To finde it, you may either apply the edge of an Inclinatorie square to the said Meridian line, and then the threed (being drawn per|pendicularly down by the plummet) will shew the said ele|vation (or inclination) of the Meridian line above the Ho|rizon, in the degrees of the limbe, if the same degrees be taken to the threed from that side of the Square that stands perpendicularly upon the Meridian line. Or else another way may be by protracting or measuring the angle D A P,
<PB N="77" REF="43">
which is the complement of the former required inclination. It may be done thus. Set one foot of your Compasses at A, and let the other foot be extended to any point of the Index, suppose to 8, then measure the same length A 8 upon the Meridian line, which let be A 7, and to this length fit your line of Chords (upon the Sector, or some like opening Scale of Chords.) Then take the length from 7 to 8, and measure the same upon your Scale of Chords, so shall you finde the quantity of the angle D A P, whose complement (or excesse) is the inclination, or elevation, or depression of the Meridian, which is here required.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>7. Other things to be noted concerning the Zodiacall Scale.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IF the Diall be described upon an irregular superficies, such as is not flat but writhen (as by this course it may very well be) then it is most convenient that the former Scale be set in some other place, and not upon the superfici|es whereon the Ellipsis is described. It may be contrived two wayes.</P>
<P>First, If the Diall superficies (how irregular soever it be on that face whereon the houres are inserted) be flat at the bottome, and be made to move (the Index standing still) upon some other plain below it) then the best way will be to make the Zodiacall Index upon the moving bottome of it, and to describe the Zodiac upon the other plain upon which the motion is made. And to do this aright, you must project the Meridian line upon that nether plain, and finde out the inclination of it, and so finde the Scale by the Se|cant of that inclination, just as you were before directed. And so this work will be compleat.
<PB N="78" REF="44">
The motion of dials unequall Superficies must be in or pa|rallel to this last projected Meridian line, alwayes so as that the Meridian of the Diall must passe through the fiduc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">all edge of the Index.</P>
<P>Secondly, If the Index be made to move (the Diall standing still) and that the Diall be upon some unequall su|per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">icies, such as is unfit to receive the Zodiac, then the foot of the Index may have it inscribed upon it. Now in this case of unequall Superficies, it is supposed that this foot of the Index cannot move parallel to that uneven Superfici|es, but must move streight forward in some right line, just along with the Meridian line. In this case you must finde the inclination of the foot of the Index to the Horizon, that is, what inclination a line drawn upon the foot of the Index, either in or parallel to the Meridian line, hath to the Horizon, which must be done by some Inclinatorie Instru|ment, or some such way as is used in taking the Reclination or Inclination of Plains. And when this is done, you are to finish the Zodiac Scale by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ecant of that inclination, in the same manner as was before shewed. So much for this.</P>
<P N="2">2. For the other Scales of the Suns Declination, Am|plitude, Ascensionall difference, and graduall motion in the 12 Signes, they are to be done in the selfe same man|ner, and by the same Tables as before (without any diffe|rence) after that you have found your Tangent Scale or De|cimall Scale out of which to describe them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="79" REF="44">
<HEAD>8. Another Observation.</HEAD>
<P>ACcording to that generall observation <HI>Pag.</HI> 36. Note here; That if to an Index standing in the Zenith line, a Plain be set in the Equinoctiall, the same plain shall have a Circular Diall upon it, equally divided. Then whether the said Equinoctiall plain or the Index move, if they be made to move upon the Horizontall plain, the Zodiac for the Horizontall plain must serve. But if the upright (or Zenith line) Index be made to move upon the Equinoctiall plain, the former Horizontall Zodiac must be set upon the Equinoctiall plain, and must there be enlarged above the Horizontall Zodiac, that is, every part of the Horizontall Zodiac must be made greater upon the Equinoctiall plain in proportion as the Radius to the Co-secant of the Latitude. That is, the Scales that made the Horizontall, being taken as Radius, must now here be enlarged to be as Co-secant of your Latitude; and from them (so enlarged) must the parts of the Zodiac be inscribed upon the Equinoctiall plain.</P>
<P>Note further. That for this Equinoctiall plain which is to descend downwards from South towards North, you may insteed of it set another plain quite contrarily, that is, des|cending from North towards South; which will be the most convenient of the two, because the upper face of this will give the houre all the Seasons of the year, whereas the other will be only for Sommer upon the upper face of it, and will require an under face for Winter.</P>

<P>_IF it stand upright, it is free from both those accidents, and falls to be the same case with the upright Index before treated of.</P>
<P>But if it lie leaning, then is it to be dealt withall in this place.</P>
<P>And first for the re / in-clination, it is best to be taken by some inclinatory (square or other) Instrument. The manner of the work is the very same that is performed
<PB N="81" REF="45">
in finding the re / in-clination of a plain: because the fiduciall edge of the Index is (here) like the Verticall line of a re / in-clining plain, and the application of the Square must here be the same to this edge that was there to the verticall line of the plain, and the degrees of re / in-clination are to be numbered in both these cases alike. So that it will not be needfull here to make repetition of that which is so often elswhere decla|red. You are here also to observe whether the re / in-clination be towards the North or towards the South.</P>
<P>Then for the declination do thus.<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> Suppose the Index to be A B. From the end of it that is furthest from the plain, as B, let fall or raise the per|pendicular B C, and let B C be some materiall object unto which the side of a Quadrant may be applyed. Or if they should be threeds (and so too
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
weake for such a purpose) you may extend another threed, as is D E, which may touch the two former threeds A B and C D, and so lie in the same plain with them, and then
<PB N="82" REF="46">
to this threed D E apply some upright plain or materiall ob|ject which may serve the intended work.</P>
<P>To this new plain therefore, or to the two lines A B, C D, apply one of the streight edges of a Quadrant, the limbe of it being turned alwayes towards the Sun, and observe the Horizontall distance of the Sun, as is usually done in finding the declinations of plains. Only here take this cau|tion, that you count not this Horizontall distance from that side of the Quadrant which is perpendicular to the plain, but from that side which lies in the line E D, or upon the two lines A B, B C. And further, you are alwayes to account this Horizontall distance from that end of the Quadrants side which lookes the same way that the point B (of the In|dex, which is furthest remote from the plain A C) doth look: as in the second figure is exprest, where the Horizontall di|stance is more than a Quadrant, it being there to be accounted from F to H. Or for more easie conceit, you may alwayes suppose your Quadrant in that posture to be continued to a Semicircle, as is done in the second figure: and then count your Horizontall distance from that term of the Semicircles Diameter which respecteth the same coast of the heavens with that point of the Index which is most remote from the plain, which is B; that is, you must count it from F, and so the Horizontall distance will be F G H, more than a Qua|drant, in this particular case.</P>
<P>The Horizontall distance being thus accounted and ob|served, you are immediately to take the Suns Altitude and to finde the Azimuth. Then for the declination of the Index, that is to know into what coast of the world, that is into what Azimuth of the Heavens (it being continued from the plain at A infinitely forwards toward B) it would point into: I say to finde this, you have only the same work to do
<PB N="83" REF="46">
which is usually done in finding the declinations of plains, the same work without any difference at all. And therefore I shall not here give any further directions in this particular, because I have done it often enough in other places, to which the Reader may have recourse.</P>
<P>And so I suppose the position of the Index in respect of re / in-clination and declination to be fully found out, both for coast and quantity; by which two things known, we are further to enquire what Longitude from our Meridian, and what Latitude the said Index pointeth unto, which will be the next Proposition.</P>

<P>Now in the second case before given where the Index points downwards, or under the Horizon, where the plain is inclining, and so looking downward, we may shape the Projection a little otherwise, and the work then will be as easie as the former.

<P>From the foot or po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">at A, set some upright threed which may represent th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">enith-line of the place, as is to be seen in that Figure <HI>Pag.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">. and is there represented by the line A D. Then one way will be to make use of some other Meridian line, observing when the Sun comes to it, and at the same moment to note out the shadow cast by the line A D, for that is the Meridian line. But this is for such su|perficies upon which the Sun comes at noon: and it ties a man to the Meridian moment. But without this we may (according to the four first Precepts) set off the Meridian line P E upon the Pastboard, and by the Zenith-line A D you may project it upon all objects that shall stand or be set in the way. For which purpose you must place some object upon that Coast of A D upon which any one of the Poles of the World may be projected, and also elevated above your Diall superficies. And upon this obiect project the Meridi|an neer that place whereabout you conjecture the Axis of the World will passe through. Then with your Semicircle (or projecting Quadrant rather) project the Axis of the World, as is usually done in my wayes of Dialling, and by that means you shall finde a point in the formerly projected Meridian,
<PB N="86" REF="48">
which shall represent the Pole of the World. And then further, if from the foot of the Index at A, to this Pole, you fasten a threed, the same threed will represent the true Axis of the world comming from the foot of the Index.</P>

<HEAD>4. Having an Axis raised from the foot of the Index, how to finde in what Longitude and Latitude the Index it selfe lyeth, by a way easier and differing from the former, without looking after any re / in-clination or declination of the said Index.</HEAD>
<P>THis way will not prove (perhaps) so good as I expected, especially in the Longitude, and therefore the former may be used.</P>
<P>The former way that I used was troublesome enough for effecting of what was by it intended, which is the cause that I shall here endeavour to give another more easie.</P>
<P>Let the Diall superficies be supposed to have upon it an Index, an Axis truly placed, issuing from the foot of the Index, with a Meridian line projected also to, or directly under the same Axis, according as was done in the work of the preceding Proposition.</P>
<P>First then, for the Latitude of the Index, it is but enqui|ring what angle is contained between the Axis and the In|dex, and the thing is resolved. Now to do this, for the manner of it, we may suppose A B to be the Index, and A X to be the Axis. Opening therefore your Compasses to any extent, set one foot of it at A, and suppose the other to reach up to <HI>m</HI> upon the Axis, at which point <HI>m</HI> fasten some knot of threed, which may first be put on, and then slipped to the point of the Compasses at <HI>m.</HI> So again, set
<PB N="87" REF="48">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
on the same extent from A to <HI>n</HI> upon the Index. and at <HI>n</HI> fasten another knot of threed. Then also to the same ex|tent open the Radius of a line of Chords. When this is done, take the distance between the two knots <HI>m</HI> and <HI>n,</HI> and measuring it upon the same line of Chords, you shall finde what angle is contained between X A and A B. If A X therefore point from A towards the North Pole, and that X A B be lesse than a Quadrant, then doth the complement of that angle X A B give the North Latitude whereinto the Index pointeth: but if X A B be more than a Quadrant,
<PB N="88" REF="49">
then doth the excesse give that South Latitude whereinto the Index pointeth. And so contrarily, if A X had pointed from A towards the South Pole, then the angle X A B being lesse than a Quadrant would give the quantity of South La|titude: but if X A B had been greater than a Quadrant, then the excesse would give the North Latitude into which the Index tendeth.</P>
<P>All the difficulty in this work is, that there is no stable place whereon to fix the Compasses for measuring of the distance between the two knots <HI>m</HI> and <HI>n:</HI> but you may hold somthing underneath close to one of the points (with|out disturbing the threeds place) on which setting one foot of your Compasses, you may measure the distance of the other point. Or else, because it is supposed that the threed Axis A X is fixed upon some solid thing at X, you may open your Compasses to the Radius A X (to which also you are to have a Radius of Chords equall) and set the same ex|tent from A to R upon the Index (prolonging the Index if need be by a threed till it come to be of a competent length) and there fasten a slipping knot. Then because X is a stable point, you may take the extent from X (setting one foot of your Compasses in that point) to R, and measure the same upon your Scale of Chords, where it will give the former angle X A R, which is to be used as is shewed before.</P>
<P>There will be found other wayes to do this last work. So much therefore for the Latitude.</P>
<P>Secondly, For the Longitude of the Index, it will not be so easily had as the other was. The way that best likes me (amongst many others) for the present, is this. By the <HI>Precepts, Pag.</HI> 70. you must make some observation of the Sun's Azimuth (and so must you also do by the last prece|dent <HI>Proposition</HI>) and you finde what Azimuth that is too.
<PB N="89" REF="49">
You may also (further) project it upon your Diall superfici|es, and then you have two Azimuths upon the said superfi|cies, namely, the Meridian, and the observed Azimuth. You are to know yet further, what Altitudes the Equinocti|all hath upon these two Azimuths. And for the Meridian it is certain enough that the Altitude there, is equall to the complement of your Latitude. For the other Azimuth say thus.</P>
<P>As the Radius, Is to the Co-tangent of your Latitude;</P>
<P>So is the Co-sine of your Azimuth, To the Tangent of the Equinoctials altitude upon that Azimuth Circle.</P>
<P>After this you must make some mark or knot upon your Axis A X, which suppose to be at <HI>m,</HI> and then with your projecting Quadrant (upon your Meridian and Azimuth) from the point <HI>m,</HI> set on the respective Equinoctiall Alti|tudes, as the manner of projecting by that Instrument useth to be.</P>
<P>Next, you must project this Equinoctiall Circle all over the Diall-superficies (and upon some other objects where need shall be,) suppose it here to be the line S V.</P>
<P>And furthermore, you are to proiect the Axis A X, and the Index A B, one upon the other, and to observe the line that they both (in that position) do make upon the Diall-superficies, and other objects if need be. I say you must, first, principally observe this line, for it is the proper Meri|dian line to the Index or Zenith line A B, because it passeth (<HI>quoad superficiem</HI>) through both the Axis of the world and the Zenith line. Suppose it in the former plain to be A &Sun;. And secondly you must note the intersection that this line makes with the Equinoctiall line which was now pro|jected,
<PB N="90" REF="50">
which we may imagine to be at V, upon some object laid in the way of purpose. And so also you must (thirdly) take notice of the intersection of the Equinoctiall line with the Meridian line, which suppose at S. For these two E|quinoctiall intersections and the point <HI>m,</HI> all three together, must do what we now intend.</P>
<P>The thing here now intended is, to know what angle is contained between the two superficies X A B, and X A T, which are two Meridian circles, or (which is the same) the angle V <HI>m</HI> S in the plain of the Equinoctiall, which angle measures the said inclination of the two forenamed Meridi|ans, as it doth of all Meridians.</P>
<P>Now to measure this angle V <HI>m</HI> S, the best way will be first to extend two threeds, one from V to <HI>m,</HI> and the other from S to <HI>m,</HI> crossing each other at <HI>m,</HI> and they may be con|tinued further till they meet with some object (in the way standing, or else set for that purpose) where they may be both fixed as at F and G. Then measure from S to <HI>m,</HI> and from V to <HI>m,</HI> which is the shortest, suppose S <HI>m</HI> to be the shortest, and V <HI>m</HI> the longest. First, take V <HI>m,</HI> and lay it down in a line, as there is done. Then take S <HI>m,</HI> and measure it on the same line from M to S or D. Thirdly, take the distance from V to D out of this line, and set it from V to D, upon the line V <HI>m,</HI> so shall <HI>m</HI> S and <HI>m</HI> D be equall one to the other. To this distance therefore <HI>m</HI> S or <HI>m</HI> D as a Radius, open some line of Chords, then take the Chord or subtense from S to D (S is a stable point upon which you may firmly set your Compasses) and measure the same length upon your line of Chords, where you shall see how many degrees the angle S <HI>m</HI> D or S <HI>m</HI> V containeth.</P>
<P>Now all this businesse is to finde how great an angle is contained between the South part of the Meridian of the
<PB N="91" REF="50">
place, and the Meridian belonging properly to the Zenith line. But here (if it be observed well) the angle now measu|red is made between the proper Meridian and the North part of the Meridian of the place, so that this angle must be the supplement (to a Semicircle) of what is required. The supplement therefore of the angle now found, is (in this case) the Longitude or Meridian into which the Zenith line A B pointeth. I say the supplement of that angle is the proper Meridian of the Zenith line; or the difference of Longitude proper to that line, from the Meridian of the place. But for|asmuch as the angle V <HI>m</HI> S doth measure the inclination or angle of this proper Meridian from the North part of the Meridian of the place, and that the shadow of the Index A B doth first come to the proper Meridian A O before it comes to A T the Meridian of the place: we may therefore in such case say, that the angle V <HI>m</HI> S gives the difference of Lon|gitude; and that the said difference of Longitude lies East|ward from the South part of the Meridian of the place, as there in the Figure it appears to lie Westward from the North part. Suppose that the difference of Longitude were 39 <HI>gr.</HI> 25 <HI>min.</HI> and the proper Latitude 40 <HI>gr.</HI> And so much for this also.</P>
<P>If this way be thought not feasible enough, the former in the second Proposition may be used; yet variety in all kindes is delightfull, and not to be rejected in this. It is done, you see, without having respect to any declination or re / in-clination, which the former was founded upon.</P>

place, and to any Latitude differing from the Latitude of your place. After that the difference of Longitude is known, you are first to frame a Table of angles at the Pole, which will not be hard to perform, and the manner of it will be seen best in an Example, being altogether like the computa|tion of the said angles at the Pole for the houres of any place to the same declining plain.</P>
<P>I have here first of all in a generall Table set down the graduall distances of houres and quarters from 12 at noon or mid-day, which will be some help in performing the work. The houres that are on the left side of the degrees are the East or forenoon houres, and those on the right hand are the West or afternoon houres. Suppose (as before <HI>Prop.</HI> 4.) a difference of Longitude were given 39 <HI>gr.</HI> 25 <HI>min.</HI> towards the East, and it were required to know what angles our hours (namely those 12 that stand neerest to it, six upon one side, and six upon the other) with their intermediate quarters do make with this Longitude or Proper Meridian, for so I in|tend to call it.</P>
<P>I first take the given Longitude or Proper Meridian, 39 <HI>gr.</HI> 25 <HI>min</HI> and enter it among the East houres of the generall Table, and I since it to fall in at A; that is, between a quarter and halfe an houre past 9 before noon, and I finde also the circumstant numbers to be 37.30 the lesser, and 41.15 the greater. The differences between these two num|bers and the Longitude given, are 1 <HI>gr.</HI> 55 <HI>min.</HI> and 1 <HI>gr.</HI> 50 <HI>min.</HI> as you see them set down in the said generall Table right against the letter A.</P>
<P>These two differences are to be first placed in this second Table of Angles at the Pole, as you see in the Example, where, first of all is written Proper Meridian 00.00 separa|ted from the rest as signifying only the place where it is to
<PB N="94" REF="52">
stand, and above it is placed (the difference between 37.30 and the proper Meridian 39.25, namely) 1 <HI>gr.</HI> 55 <HI>min.</HI> So again, below it is placed 1 <HI>gr.</HI> 50 <HI>min.</HI> (which is the diffe|rence of 39 <HI>gr.</HI> 25 <HI>min.</HI> the proper Meridian from the next greater number 41 <HI>gr.</HI> 15 <HI>min.</HI>) Now to these two radicall numbers, I adde &frac14; &frac12; &frac34; and one whole houre, namely <HI>a, b, c,</HI> and thereby produce <HI>e, f, g,</HI> on both sides the pro|per Meridian. Then to <HI>r, e, f, g,</HI> I adde 15 <HI>gr. d,</HI> name|ly, the number of one houre, and thereby do further produce <HI>h, i, k, l,</HI> on both sides the Proper Meridian, as before. And afterwards for more ease, to the numbers <HI>r, e, f, g, h, i, k, l,</HI> I adde 30 <HI>gr.</HI> or two houres, and do thereby pro|duce on both sides the eight numbers noted with the letter <HI>m.</HI> And so still adding 30 <HI>gr.</HI> to the last eight numbers no|ted with <HI>m,</HI> or else adding 60 <HI>gr.</HI> to the first eight numbers noted with <HI>r, e, f, g, h, i, k, l,</HI> I shall make the eight re|maining numbers noted with the letter <HI>n,</HI> both above and below, on both sides the Proper Meridian. And so this Table of Angles at the Pole is compleated, for if it should (in the same manner) be further continued, the next num|bers (above) would be 91 <HI>gr.</HI> 55 <HI>min.</HI> and (below) 91 <HI>gr.</HI> 50 <HI>min.</HI> both greater than 90 <HI>gr.</HI> beyond which there will be neither need nor expedience to go.</P>
<P>This way of forming the angles I thought best to take, because it is more plain and easie than any other, which else might have been in this work used.</P>
<P>You are afterward to place the houres (in this last Table) about the Proper Meridian, just as you see their order to be about the letter A in the general Table, and as you see they are in this particular Table of Angles at the Pole.</P>
<P>The like work serves for West Longitudes.</P>
<P>Thus you have the angles for 12 houres and their quarters,
<PB N="95" REF="52">
the same angles serve for the other 12 houres: and whatsoe|ver is hereafter computed for any of these 12 houres, must be understood to serve also for the 12 opposites, and so the work will be done for the whole Circle, or 24 houres of the naturall day.</P>

<HEAD>6. By knowing the angles at the Pole, and the Latitude of the place or Horizon, how to finde the Horizontall Spaces thereto belonging.</HEAD>
<P>WE must suppose that this Longitude or Meridian which we have before mentioned, is proper to some Horizon or other, above which also the elevation of the Pole must be imagined known, which we may suppose to be 40 <HI>gr.</HI> as before, <HI>Prop.</HI> 4. In respect of this plain or Ho|rizon it is, that the Spaces now mentioned are called Hori|zontall Spaces.</P>
<P>The way to finde them for this Ellipticall work is con|verse to that which is usuall in declining plains. Namely thus,</P>
<P>As the Sine of the Poles elevation above this Horizon or Plain, Is to the Radius;</P>
<P>So is the Tangent of each of these angles at the Pole, To the Tangent of the Horizontall space belonging to each of those foresaid angles.</P>
<P>So having found all these Horizontall spaces severally by this form of calculation, you may set them into a Table, as here you see it done in the first of the two main Columns. They signifie the distances of every of the houres and
<PB N="96" REF="53">
quarters from the proper Meridian, and are to be accounted as numbered in the degrees of the said plain or Horizon.</P>

<P>As the Radius, Is to the Co-sine of the Poles elevation above the plain or Horizon;</P>
<P>So is the Co-sine of any of the Angles specified in the former Table of Angles at the Pole; To the Sine of the Altitude required, and due to that angle, or houre (rather) in the Equinoctiall Circle.</P>
<P>So in the former example. The Latitude or elevation of the Pole above the Horizon was 40 <HI>gr.</HI> the complement of that is 50 <HI>gr.</HI> which is the Meridian altitude and depression of the Equinoctiall Circle above and under the said Hori|zon or plain, and is therefore to be set for the altitude of the proper Meridian. Now,</P>
<P>As the Radius, Is to the altitude of 50 <HI>gr.</HI></P>
<P>So is the Co-sine of every angle at the Pole, or arke of the Equinoctiall in the former Table, To the Altitude due thereunto.</P>

<HEAD>9. How to draw and divide the Elli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sis into houres and quarters, to an Index casually set, whose Latitude and difference of Longitude is discovered by the former works.</HEAD>
<P>WHen you know the position of your Index in respect of Longitude and Latitude, you may then compute two Tables to the same Meridian or difference of Longi|tude, and to the Latitude of your Index, as is done before in the 7 <HI>Proposition,</HI> one of which Tables is of Horizontall Spaces, the other of Equinoctiall Altitudes or Depressions above and under that Horizon which is proper to the In|dex or Zenith line casually placed.</P>
<P>By these two Tables the work will be done in such man|ner as was shewed before, <HI>Prop.</HI> 2. The manner of the work is this.</P>
<P N="1">1. You are to assume some point in your Index A B, let the point be C, where you may fasten some knot of threed that it may not be lost again.</P>
<P N="2">2. From this point you must draw an Horizontall line, not in the levell of your own Horizon, but in that Horizon which is proper to that Index or Zenith line A B: that is, it must lie perpendicular to A B, making right angles (in e|very part of it) to that line, and must have respect (in this perpendicularity) to the point C. The meaning is, you must imagine a plain to passe through the point C, and the same plain to be perpendicular to the line A B; or that the line A B is a perpendicular surgent line to the said plain passing through the point at C.</P>
<P>Now this work will be somewhat hard to perform if A B
<PB N="100" REF="55">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
be a threed only, and not of some more stur|dy substance. Yet the best of it is, that there is no very great pre|cisenesse here required, for the work to be done will be good though this Horizon|tall plain be not placed so exactly perpendicu|lar.</P>
<P>[And so it may be noted, that if other Dials be described by the Equinoctiall Circle and not by the Horizon|tall, the work of drawing the Equinoctiall perpen|dicular to the Axis will be difficult, but though no great accuratenesse be used, yet the work will be per|fect enough, and no way defective for the losse of a degree or two in the perpendicularity required, which I thought good here also to note, because I have omitted it in all my other Precepts of Projecting Dials.]</P>
<P>Wherefore you may do it by some Pastboard, applying one edge of it to any line projected from A B the Index, as to A D, and keeping the edge there, you may turn the flat of it to the Index A B, and draw a line by it, or make two pricks through it into the pastboard, whereby a line may be drawn, but above all note the point C upon it. Then to this line of the Index thus drawn, and from the noted point of it at C, erect a perpendicular: So applying your Pastboard
<PB N="101" REF="55">
to its former place again (the edge of it lying upon A D, and the flat of it applyed to the Index A B, and the point in it, noted for C, being again fitted to C in the Index, I say thus doing) you may note where the last drawn perpendicular doth cut the line A D (which must be extended by help of some threed if need be) suppose at E: at the point E (then) you must say that one point of the proper Horizontall line is to be taken. Then in like manner you must seeke another Horizontall point: first by projecting a line from the Index (any where) such as is A F, and by applying one edge of a pastboard to that line, and the plain of that pastboard to the Index A B, and so noting the point C, and drawing or mark|ing the line A B upon it, &amp;c. as was done before. So you shall finde another point of the same Horizontal line or plain (rather) which suppose to fall at F.</P>
<P>Now having three points of the Horizontall plain at C, E, and F, (which I suppose not to lie in one and the same right line, for that must with carefulnesse be avoided here) you may project some part of that line upon the plain, as E F, the rest of it (so much as shall be found usefull) may be made up with returns of threed, and regulated or kept in the same plain by projection, as the man|ner of working that way useth to be, and as here you see exprest, by the line H E F G, lying in the same plain with the point C, and that whole plain lying perpendi|cular to the Index A B.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P N="3">3. The next thing to be done is the drawing of the houre lines upon the plain. And the first
<PB N="102" REF="56">
thing h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re presupposed to be done, is the drawing of the proper Meridian, performed by the 8 <HI>Prop.</HI> That (I say) is supposed as already done before any of this work is begun. Let the proper Meridian be A V. Having then made Tables (by the 7 <HI>Prop.</HI>) for the Horizontall Spaces of your hours from this proper Meridian A B; you must first apply a past|board to the Horizontall line E F, and fit the center of it to C: and upon the Pastboard, project the proper Meridian from C to A V, or from C to P. And then by the Table of Horizontall Spaces in the 7 <HI>Prop.</HI> (for we now here suppose that this is the Diall for which those Tables were computed) you may (upon that pastboard) set off all the houres and quarters from the proper Meridian upon this pastboard: and applying the pastboard into its proper place, namely to the Horizontall line E P F, and to the point C, you may project the houres and parts of houres from the Pastboard to the ho|rizontall line H E P F G, as the manner in this way of Di|alling is well known.</P>
<P N="4">4. Having transferred the houre-points into the Hori|zontall line, you may (by help of your Index A B) project and draw the houre lines upon the plain, which we will sup|pose done, because the manner of doing it is the same with that which was done before for upright Indexes.</P>
<P N="5">5. To know where the Ellipticall line must come, or to finde the points in those houre lines, through which it must passe, we must work in the same manner as before (in the 7 &sect; of <HI>Pag.</HI> 7<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.) is exprest, namely thus. We must make a Scale of right Sines of a fit length, and number them Ver|sedly, and out of that Scale we must take such Altitudes or Profundities (which you will, one or both) as the Table <HI>Pag</HI> 97. giveth, which Table we here suppose to be compu|ted for this Example whereabout we now are. And taking
<PB N="103" REF="56">
these Altitudes from that Scale (that is, from the end at 90, to the altitude numbered upon the parts of the Scale) we must insert them into their respective houres to which they belong. They must be inserted in this manner. Having ta|ken any altitude out of the Scale, and found the houre upon which it must be placed, you must set one foot of that extent upon the houre line (keeping it alwayes thereon, but) remo|ving it untill the other foot being turned about, may only touch the fiduciall edge of the Index: and when the feet of the Compasses are thus fitted, you must note upon what point of the houre line the foot that is thereon doth stand, for through that point of that houre must the Ellipticall line passe.</P>
<P>The same manner of work you must perform upon every houre, untill you have gone through 12 of them, which do make up halfe the houres of the whole Diall. And if you strike the lines through the center, you shall have all the 24. And looke what is done upon any one houre line, the same is to be done upon the opposite. That is, looke what distance (upon a plain) the Ellipsis hath from the center upon any one line, the selfe same distance from the center must the oppo|site line have. But if the description be made upon an uneven superficies, then this rule may not, perhaps, hold: yet this will; namely, Looke what distance from the Index (the least or perpendicular Index I mean) any point of the Ellip|sis hath, the same perpendicular distance is to be given for the Ellipsis upon the opposite houre line. And by this means you may put in as many houres and Ellipticall points as you please. And through these points you are to draw the El|lipticall line.</P>

<HEAD>10. Concerning the motion that is to be made, either by the Index, or by the Ellipsis it selfe.</HEAD>
<P>THe motion must be either in, or else parallel to, the pro|per Meridian, and not elsewhere. Now if the Diall Superficies be made to slide, and the Index stand still; then (though the Diall be upon an unequall superficies, yet) the motion or sliding must be upon a plain. And it must be up|on the proper Meridian, projected by the Index from the Diall plate, unto or upon that said plain, and the motion must be in or parallel to it. And it must be noted, that this proper Meridian thus projected never falls directly under any Index that is (not direct but) declining, but it falls aside from it, according as the Index stands aside from the proper Meridian upon the Diall superficies, and as it shall be laid by projecting it.</P>
<P>But if the Index move (the Diall standing still) then the fiduciall edge of it must be made to move alwayes according to, and in the very proper Meridian line it selfe, and not any where else, which may be contrived sundry wayes, as eve|ry man shall invent to his own liking. Great care must be had that the fiduciall edge of the Index (in the motion of it) keepe alwayes one justly parallel situation.</P>

<P>THe best place for it is to be considered of according to that which moveth.</P>

therefore in this case is fittest to receive the Zodiac. And then there may a peculiar point or threed Index (serving only for the Zodiac) be set upon the Diall-moving-plate, where|by it may be rectified according to the time of the year.</P>
<P>If the Index be made to move, then either the Zodiac may be set upon the foot of the Index which guides the motion of it, and the peculiar or Zodiacall Index may be set somewhere where it may stand to point at the Zodiac. Or else the Zodiac it selfe may have its place upon some part of the standing plate or body, and the Zodiacall Index may be placed upon the foot of the Diall Index; from whence it may be made to shew the Zodiacall parts, as oc|casion shall be.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>12. How the Zodiac is to be limited in regard of length, and how to be described and set in its true place.</HEAD>
<P>THe limitation of it must be according to the Scale of Sines by which the Ellipsis is described, which Scale is mentioned <HI>Pag</HI> 102 &sect; 5. and <HI>Pag.</HI> 73 &sect; 7&punc;</P>
<P>The Index or Diall plate (that is the mover) must move according to the proper Meridian of the Diall Superficies, and precisely so, as that fiducial edge of the Index must move (not elsewhere, but) in the very proper Meridian it self. This is, if the Index move. But if the Diall Superficies move, then the proper Meridian thereof (or the Superficies of the proper Meridian, namely the Superficies made by the pro|per Meridian cutting through the Diall plate, which is of any thicknesse) must move directly upon, or through, the fiduciall edge of the Index. These things are intimated be|fore. And that the Zodiac is to be described upon a plain,
<PB N="106" REF="58">
though the Diall it selfe be not so. And further, that if the Diall plate move, (though it be not a plain it selfe, yet) it must move upon a plain, and that the proper Meridian is to be described upon the same plain, and the motion to be directed according thereunto. These things are often incul|cated, because they are hard to be conceived, and had need of the better consideration for that reason. Now further.</P>
<P N="1">1. If the Diall plate be supposed thus to move upon a plain, and on it the proper Meridian be drawn, then first of all, The angle is to be inquired that is made between the In|dex and that part of the proper Meridian which is projected upon the plain whereon the motion is made, which how to measure will be a hard matter to give rules for, because the variety of cases and positions of one to the other will be so various. It is first to be supposed, that it makes a just right angle with it, and consequently that the Zodiac is described upon the proper horizon of the Index. And if upon this supposition the Zodiac be to be limited, then the rule will be the same with the former given in the like case, namely thus. Upon your Scale of Sines (by which you described your Ellipticall line) take from 90, to the Latitude of the Index, and count that length for a new Radius, and keepe it. Then when you have found the forenamed angle (of finding which more is said <HI>Prop.</HI> 13. following) to this new Radius finde the Secant of the complement or excesse of that angle: this length or Secant will be the Tangent of 45 <HI>gr.</HI> or the Decimall Scale by which you are to describe the Zo|diac on both sides from the Equinoctiall point or line, ac|cording to the numbers in the generall Tables made for this purpose, <HI>Pag.</HI> 4, 5, 6, and 7.</P>
<P>[For placing the Equinoctiall point in the Zodiac (upon which all the other parts of that Scale do depend)
<PB N="107" REF="58">
you must set all in the same posture that they had when the Diall was described: and when you have made fit place for the Zodiac, and set on some pecu|liar Zodiacall Index, you must note the place upon which the said Zodiacall Index pointeth, for that place is the peculiar place for the Equinoctiall, from whence all the other parts of the Suns annuall course must be set on.]</P>
<P N="2">2. If the Index be made to move in any depth under the Diall superficies, then a slit must be made in the same Super|ficies that the proper Meridian would cut, and the Index continued therein, down into one streight line till it meet with the foot whereon the Index is fixed, and which being moved, carryeth the Index along with it. And the Zodiac must be described either upon this foot (the Zodiacall Index being made to stand still while that said foot with its divisi|ons moveth) and that also parallel to (or in) the proper Me|ridian projected upon it: or else the foot must carry the Zo|diacall Index, and the Zodiac must be described upon some other convenient place, as the sides (&amp;c.) of that foremen|tioned flat. And here, for limitation of the Zodiacs length, you must finde the Inclination of this moving foot to the In|dex or Zenith line (which angle of inclination is mentioned before, and spoken of afterwards in the 13 <HI>Prop.</HI> following) and work directly as you did before by finding the new Ra|dius, and the Secant of the complement (or excesse) of the angle. By which you shall finde the Tangent of 45 <HI>gr.</HI> or the length of your Decimall Scale, out of which the Zodi|ac may be described by the Tables&punc; <HI>Pag.</HI> 4, 5, &amp;c. as is men|tioned before in this proposition. Thus (in these cases) is the Zodiac to be set in its true place, thus it is to be limited and d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">scribed.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="59">For Occurrences of other sorts of Cases than are here mentioned (whereof there will not be many) he that can un|derstand to do these things aright, will be able to grapple with them; and for such as do not understand what is here said, their best course is to let these difficulties alone.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>13. How to finde what angle is made between the Index and that part of the proper Meridian which is projected upon the plain whereon the motion is made, or which drawn upon the foot of the Index which maketh the same motion.</HEAD>
<P>THe way that for the present I thinke of is this. Apply a streight edge of pastboard to the projected line, and the plain of the same pastboard to the fiduciall edge of the Index, and make two points upon the pastboard, by or through which the same fiduciall edge passeth. Then taking away the Pastboard, draw a streight line through those two points or marks, and so measure the angle made between the forenamed edge of the pastboard and this right line. If it be so that the line crosseth not the edge of the Pastboar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, then draw such a parallel line to the edge as may crosse the former line, and then with a Scale of Chords you may measure the angle.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>14. Further observations concerning the motion and daily fitting of the Diall and Index, for setting them true.</HEAD>
<P>THe best way is to make the Diall plate move, and the Index to stand still (in these obliquely situated Index|es)
<PB N="109" REF="59">
for the Zodiac will (in such cases) be most easily descri|bed and made usefull. And in this case the Index may be also set fast first, and quite finished before the Diall be drawn at all. Then also the Diall will be drawn more easily, and the motion of the Diall plate may sooner (this way) be con|trived, then can the motion of the Index be contrived when the said Index is to move and the Diall stand still. The mo|tion (as hath been often said) must be according (that is pa|rallel) to the proper Meridian: and the slit (for the fiduciall edge of the Index) may be so contrived that the fiduciall edge it selfe (which is best to be a fine threed) may be also the proper Index, and the Zodiac may be described upon the Diall-moving-plate, closely contrived to the threed. Or thus at least, The lenght of the whole Zodiac may be so li|mited as is before mentioned, and then if you desire to have it drawn upon some other place of the plain upon which the Diall superficies moveth, and the same Diall plate to carry the peculiar Index for the Zodiac; then (I say) by these two terms prefixed to the length of the Zodiac (by the fiduciall edge of the Index) having reference to the Diall-moving-plate (as before) you may determine the length of the same Zodiac upon the standing plate whereon the Diall plate mo|veth, for the new Zodiacall Index set fast into the moving plate, will (upon the standing plate) shew the terms of the same Zodiac suting with the terms upon the moving plate fitted to the standing Index. This will be direction enough because one way may serve as well as many. Yet I doubt not to set down many more which would be without end, if they were all put together, for inventions in this kinde would be too too many.</P>
<P N="2">2. If the Index be thought best to move, then must a pattern of it (that is some threed) be first set up. And to this
<PB N="110" REF="60">
vice-Index must the Diall be described upon the plain (or whatever curved Superficies it be.) And the Zodiac is best to be fitted either upon the plain whereon the foot of the In|dex is to move (for a plain it must move upon, whatever be the Superficies whereon the Diall is described) and that same foot to carry the Zodiacall Index upon it; or else upon the foot of the Index, and the Zodiacall or peculiar Index to stand fixt upon the plain (or Diall superficies) And then when all this is done, the vice-Index must be taken away and a true substantiall Index put in the place of it. And for that purpose, you were best, before you take it away, to finde at what elevation it stood from the plain, and likewise to draw the perpendicular just under it. For by these two helps you may set up a true substantiall Index, regulating it thereby into the same position; which to do, must be left to the judgement of every man to contrive as he shall see requisite.</P>
<P>But in both these wayes care must be had what inclinati|on the Zodiacall Scale hath to the Index, according to what is said in the 13 <HI>Prop.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. It must here again be taken for a Rule, thot a plain, if it lie parallel to the index is not possibly capable of these kindes of Ellipticall houres, but the Index must have some inclination to the plain, and make some angle with the same.</P>
<P N="4">4. All these Precepts do serve to make such Dials as are upon fixed walls or Superficies that cannot be removed. But if it be to be done for moveable Bodies, if they be regularly cut, then the declinations of every of the plains are known by their regularity; so that such plains of them as are capable of any Diall before mentioned (for the Index and the plain must not be parallel in any case, they may be perpendicular) may have such Dials upon them as they are capable of, either to Indexes perpendicular to their plains, or to Indexes lying
<PB N="111" REF="60">
in the Zenith line of the place. But for these casuall Index|es upon them, you will be put to it, to know what declinati|ons they have from the Meridian upon the regular body (for I suppose that there is a Meridian drawn upon some one of the plains or other.) The way that for the present I think upon is this. Set the Body upon the foot true in respect of horizontall or upright position, that is, let the foot of it stand upon some just horizontall plain, though in respect of declination it stand at all adventures. Then from the fidu|ciall edge of your casuall Index, let fall a perpendicular (I mean perpendicular to the Horizon of the place, not to the plain) and to that perpendicular point, from the point of the Indexes concourse with the plain, draw a right line; this line shall represent the Azimuth wherein the said Index lyeth. Then again, with your eye repose a perpendicular hanging threed upon the two points (namely, the center or concourse of the Index with the plain, and the late found perpendicu|lar point) both together, and project the umbrage of the threed so hanging upon the Horizontall plain. So also you must repose the shadow of some one of the Cocks or Axes with your eye, upon the Meridian or line of 12, and then al|so the perpendicular threed must be projected upon them both joyned before into one, so that Threed, Stile, and Me|ridian must now be all as one line; and the threed so hang|ing project the shadow of it upon the same Horizontall plain. Now these two lines thus projected either do concur and make an angle, or else (by drawing a parallel to one of them through the other) they must be made to concur, and looke what angle they make at their concurrence, the same being counted the right way is the angle of the casuall Indexes declination from the Meridian line. Thus the Declinati|on is found.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="61">Then the Reclination may be found as before is declared, and by help of them the Longitude and Latitude of the In|dex may be had, and so the Diall made by the precedent Precepts.</P>

<HEAD>A briefe DEMONSTRATION of the 7^t^h. and 8^t^h. Sections.</HEAD>
<P>_IN the 7 &sect; all are made to the Zenith line of the place. If therefore you imagine an Horizontall Ellipsis to be described to that Zenith line, and upon that Ellipsis a kinde of compressed Cylinder to rise up|right, parallel to the said Zenith line, with houre lines raised from the severall points of the Horizontall Ellipsis, then will the Zenith line shew the houre upon those surgent lines: and the same Index (or Zenith line) must shew the houre among tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e upright lines in the compressed Cylinder, by the same reason that it doth upon the Ellipsis it selfe, upon which the said Cylinder is raised, And if so, then it matters not what part of these lines is taken in for this use, since any one point of them will serve to do the work. The way therefore that is used for the projecting of these houres (by help of the Table in 29 <HI>Pag.</HI>) as it will serve to finde the Ellipticall points upon the Horizontall plain it selfe, so must it serve to finde some
<PB N="113" REF="61">
one point of these surgent houre lines upon any other Super|ficies, because they keepe the same distances alwayes from the Zenith line (from whence the projection of them is made, and whereon they depend altogether) and therefore it findes (upon any Superficies) the points of those lines which passe through, or do intersect the Diall Superficies. Therefore it is that these Ellipticall points (upon all Su|perficies) are points of those surgent lines rising from the Horizontall plain, and that the Zenith line must have the same relation and situation to them, that it had to the points upon the Horizontall plain it selfe, And consequently, that this way must be of the same truth upon any Superficies that it is upon the Horizontall. So much for any upright Index, set upon all sorts of Superficies, with the houres thereon depending.</P>
<P>In the 8 &sect;. are handled casuall Indexes; which if well considered will fall to be the same with them in the 7 &sect;. For the Table of Angles and Altitudes by which they are made, are calculated to that Horizon which is proper to the Index, considered as a Zenith line. And so from that Horizon we may imagine the like surgent lines to rise all parallel to the Index or Zenith line, and the very same reason to hold in these, that held in the former.</P>

And in all Northern Horizons &Cancer; (or the longest dayes) must be so placed that the point of 12 in the Circle may then be neerest to the Index, and in &Capri; (or the shortest dayes) it may be furthest of. But in Southern Latitudes, the places of &Cancer; and &Capri; are quite con|trary, because there the Sun being in &Capri; makes the longest day, and in &Cancer; the shortest.</P>

<HEAD>A briefe DEMONSTRATION of these Circular wayes of making DIALS.</HEAD>
<P>_THe Circular wayes have dependance, and are de|duced out of the precedent Ellipticall wayes; and the Cases are but two, wherein the same may be done upon any Horizon or plain, as may be per|ceived by the former Precepts, wherein the altitudes of the Indexes above the plain are ever made to be either halfe the complement of the Plains Latitude, or else (the summe of the Latitude and that halfe complement, which summe is equall to) the complement of that forenamed halfe com|plement.</P>
<P>According to these two cases here are two Schemes fit|ted. The projections are made upon the plain of the Meri|dian Circle P Z H X. P is the Pole, Z the Zenith of the place, H A the Horizon of the place, Ae A the Equinoctiall Circle, D A and R A are drawn in the middle of Z P and Ae H or Ae O. D B C X represents one Azimuth or Ver|ticall Circle proper to the plain R A, and by that one all the rest of them may be understood. D A represents the Index in both the former Cases, and R A the Horizontall plain (not of the place but that Horizontall plai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> which is) pro|perly
<PB N="127" REF="68">
belonging to the In|dex or Zenith line D A. The first Scheme shews the first of the two former Cases, the second shews the second of them. Their Demonstrations will be both one. For the questi|on in them both is, How to these inclinations of the Index, the Diall, or hora|ry line, that falls upon the Horizontall plain of the place, comes to be a per|fect Circle.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>First, therefore consi|der, that in all the Ellipti|call Dials, the horary line hath relation to the Equi|noctiall Circle, and to the Index or line that is to give the shadow (whatsoever the Superficies be upon which the projecture is made, whether plain or o|therwise it matters not, as appears before, but here we deale only with plains, because Ellipses and Circles are plain Figures.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Secondly, consider, that through the severall houre points of the Equinoctiall Circle, right lines are to be sup|posed to passe infinitely extended, till they meet with the plain whereon the projecture is to be designed. Which
<PB N="128" REF="69">
issuing out of these infinite lines (if they be regularly cloath|ed about with an inflected Superficies must comprehend a Cylindricall concave, either round or compressed according as the forenamed infinite lines are either perpendicular to the plain of the Equinoctiall, or not perpendicular to it.</P>
<P>Thirdly, These parallel lines so drawn through the houre points of the Equinoctiall, parallel to the Index, must all fall perpendicular to the Horizontall plain which is pro|perly belonging to the Index as a Zenith line. And the same lines upon that proper Horizon do alwayes make an Ellipsis, except only these two Cases. First, If the Horizon be the same with the Equinoctiall Circle, and the Zenith line or Index the same with the Axis of the world, for then those lines do there make a perfect Circle. Secondly, If the Ho|rizon be a Polar or Meridian Horizon, and the Index or Ze|nith line fall into the Equinoctiall (having no Latitude from it) for then those lines do all fall into (or coincide with) the plain of the Equinoctiall, and consequently do make (upon their proper Horizon) a direct right line: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ea more, because the said lines do lie all upon the plain of the Equi|noctiall, and are all drawn out of the equall divisions of the Equinoctiall Circle, and besides are all parallel one to the other; therefore they make (in this case) a double line of Sines, as is said before in the fifth note <HI>Pag.</HI> 37. Now to come to my intended purpose, which is, to prove <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> In|dexes so laid (as is mentioned before in the two precedent Cases) will require (upon the Horizontall plain of the place) a true Circle and not an Ellipsis.</P>
<P>Suppose therefore D A to be the Index (according to one of the two precedent conditions) then must R A be the pro|per Horizon to that Index. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d according to the former Doctrine, if Ae, and B, and A, be taken for three of the
<PB N="129" REF="69">
houre points in the Equinoctiall, and Azimuths drawn through them from D the Verticall point of the Index, then I say (in these two cases and not otherwise) looke how the Equinoctiall is divided by those Circles, in the same manner is H O the Horizon of the place divided. But because the Equinoctiall is ever equally divided in respect of houres, therefore the Circles from D to X (from the Zenith of the proper Horizon R A to the Nadir, which are Azimu|thall Circles) shall cut the Horizon of the place (H O) into equall parts. This, I say, is true, Because D Ae B and X H C are equall Sphericall Triangles in three of their quantities [For D Ae is equall to X H, and the angles at D and X are equall, as also the right angles at Ae and H] and therefore equall in all the rest, if like be compared to like: that is, H C is equall to Ae B; and consequently A C equal to A B: so also C X equall to B D. And if so, then the Chord B C must be parallel to the Index or Zenith line D X, and so Ae H is parallel to D X, and so contrarily (in these two Ca|ses) right lines drawn from the houre points in the Equino|ctiall Circle, parallel to the Index, must cut (upon the Ho|rizon of the place) equall parts, equall to one another, and equall to the houres upon the Equinoctiall Circle. That is to say, they cut the horizontall Circle it selfe into 24 equall parts or hours. And consequently (in these two Cases) those forementioned right lines must designe (the horizontall Circle it selfe, that is) a Circle upon the horizontall plain of the place, though upon the proper Horizon it selfe (R A) they must designe an Ellipsis (falling perpendicularly there|on) according to the third observation in the 128 <HI>Pag.</HI> And from that Ellipsis these lines B C, H Ae, may be conceived as surgent lines (such as are mentioned before <HI>Pag.</HI> 113) con|taining a compressed Cylinder, which Cylinder being cut
<PB N="130" REF="70">
two wayes, (that is subcontrarily) will again reveile the ori|ginall Circle (at least in one of the two Sections) from whence it selfe and the surgent lines tooke their forme and places.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>NOTE.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The same reason holds in all plains, that in them also there may be found such a <HI>Circular Horologiography.</HI> For they are Horizons to some place of the World or other, and are therefore capable of the same accidents that the forementioned Horizon of a particular place is.</P>
<P N="2">2. That these Cases are the same (in a manner) with those &sect;. 5. For here a new Zenith line (as D A) is found to H O the Horizon of the place, such a Zenith line (or Index) as may lie equidistant from the Horizon of the place H O, and from the Aequinoctiall Circle Ae A: And there there is a plain set up which may stand so, as that the Zenith line of the place may stand equally distant from the Aequi|noctiall Circle and this plain. In both, the Index shands equally distant from the Equinoctiall, and from the plain whereon the houre points are to be inserted.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>For the limitation of the Zodiac.</HEAD>
<P>The first work in the limitation of it is for the Ellipsis that should be described upon the proper Horizon, and the ground of that is the same with what was before delivered <HI>Pag.</HI> 75. The reason of both will be plain enough out of the forego|ing Diagrams.

Here is only to be shewed the reason of the enlarge|ment.
<PB N="131" REF="70">
If the Index were set upon the proper Horizon R A, then it must move thereon (perpendicularly) from A to S suppose. But it moves not upon that but upon H O the ho|rizontall plain of the place, and yet to keepe the same di|stances in motion from the first position of it in D A X, that is, it must move parallel alwayes to D A, but not upon A S but upon A H, which to do, it must not have the parts of the Zodiac in A S (to guide upon H O) but proportionall ones to them, that is, instead of A S must be taken A <HI>m</HI>; which is all one as to say, As A S the Radius, to A <HI>m</HI> the Co|secant of S <HI>m</HI> A, or D A O, the Indexes elevation (above the Horizon H O;) So are the parts of A S the prime or fundamentall Zodiac, to the parts of A <HI>m,</HI> the secondary or inlarged Zodiac.</P>

<HEAD>Concerning Dials made upon a finite streight line, with a moveable Index.</HEAD>
<P>_THis may seem no difficult nor new thing, since the most vulgar known way of pro|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">racting Dials is either by one contingent line (which is a right line;) or else by two Tangent lines, as by the Sector is usually done. But it must be considered, that the contingent line is infinite, and this line (here mentioned) is finite. Again, that other way by the Sector, is not by one finite line, but by two at the least; whereas this is by one finite line&punc; Some difference there is. And besides; that other
<PB N="136" REF="73">
by Tangents may be as well done upon a single crooked line, this cannot.</P>
<P>This streight line is mentioned before, that in right Hori|zons or Polar plains the Ellipsis shutreth up into a streight line. And it is true, that this falls out to be so, onely in right Horizons (if the Index stand perpendicular to the plain, as is before intended) which cases happen but seldome, and to some plains onely. But here my purpose is to shew how it may be done to all plains whatsoever: observing on|ly this one condition; alwayes to set the Index so, as to point up into the Equinoctiall Circle: for so it must do, and will not be done any other way, according to this forme of casting the houres.</P>
<P>There are two Cases which will offer themselves.</P>
<P>The first is, when the Index pointeth up both into the Equinoctiall Circle, and likewise into the plains proper Me|ridian Circle.</P>
<P>The second is, when it points up into the Equinoctiall Circle of the heavens (for so it must ever do) and into some other Meridian Circle, such as is not proper to the plain.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>&para; 1. How to make a Diall upon a finite streight line, drawn upon any plain, the Index being so ordered that it point up into the Equinoctiall Circle, and into the plains proper Meridian.</HEAD>
<P>IN this Case, the Index is to lie just over the proper Meri|dian of the plain, and is to be elevated so much above that line as the height of the Equinoctiall above that plain comes unto, and must point up into the Equinoctiall Circle it selfe.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="73">It must therefore here be supposed that the situation of the plain, with such things as are thereon depending, are known. Such are these that follow.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 The plains reclination or inclination and declination.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 The position of the Substylar, or plains proper me|ridian</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The elevation of the Pole above the plain.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The plains difference of Longitude from your Me|ridian.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>These things are to be found by the common wayes of making of Dials upon plains, which need not here be re|peated, but shall be supposed to be already known, and pla|ced in their true positions upon the plain. Let A B be the
<PB N="138" REF="74">
proper Meridian of the plain truly placed, and A D the In|dex standing over it, and pointing up into the Equinoctiall. Let the degrees of the difference of the plains longitude be C L, and let the point L stand from C upon the right Coast according to the exigence of the plain. Then for drawing and dividing the line that is to give the houres, do thus.</P>
<P N="1">1. Supposing A to be the point of the Equinoctiall (in the Zodiacall motion of the Index) through that point draw R A S perpendicular to B A C the proper Meridian; and upon A as the center, and to any convenient extent, describe the Circle R C S, in which, C L is to be set according to the difference of Longitude, as was before mentioned. So that L is the point from whence you must begin to divide your Circle, for from L is the point of the houre 12 dedu|ced. Therefore,</P>
<P N="2">2. Divide your Circle from L into 24 houres at <HI>a, b, c, d, e, f, &amp;c. l, m, n, o, &amp;c.</HI> and from each of these points let perpendiculars fall upon the diameter R S, as L <HI>m, an, bp, &amp;c.</HI> the same Perpendiculars shall divide the Diameter into the houres required: <HI>m</HI> shall be the point of 12, because it falls from L, the point of the difference of Longitude: <HI>n</HI> and <HI>o</HI> shall be the next houres to 12 on both sides: <HI>p</HI> and <HI>q</HI> shall be the second houre points on both sides 12, and so the rest in their orders.</P>
<P>But then in these Dials, when the difference of Longitude falls not just upon an hour (as very seldome (and then but casually) it doth) the line R S will be crosse divided as you see it in this example, for <HI>e</HI> R <HI>u</HI> is one hour, and unequally broken and set upon the Diameter R S: so <HI>t</HI> S <HI>o</HI> is the space of 5 houres; and the points <HI>t</HI> and <HI>o</HI> stand crosse or distant one from the other, and are not coincident; which I say must alwayes happen when the difference of Longitude is
<PB N="139" REF="74">
not equall to one or more just full houres.</P>
<P N="3">3. In these crosse houres (for so I may call them) you may divide each side of the line severally, as thus:</P>

</FIGURE></P>
<P>Or else you may make a double line in this manner, sup|posing the fiduciall line to be the white that lies intire and un|divided betwixt them.</P>
<P><FIGURE>

<P>This kinde of Diall will be somwhat difficult in the use, because of this crosse division of the houres. Yet I thought best not to omit it, because it is the ground of the next Case which will be more usefull.</P>

<HEAD>Concerning the Zodiac and the Index.</HEAD>
<P>FOr the limitation of the Zodiac, let A R or A S be as Radius. To that Radius let A F be the Tangent of 23&frac12;.

parts upon one side justly corresponding to the just houres and parts upon the other side. This will be for more expe|dite use than the former way could be, and no such trouble nor confusion in the numeration of houres and parts of houres, as will appear in the next Example.</P>

<P>&para; First, for the Index: The best way will be to finde what Declination and Reclination (in respect of the Meri|dian and Zenith of the plain) the houre point (into which the Index must point) hath. And that is done by these two Rules.</P>
<P N="1">1. As the Radius, to the Sine of the Equinoctials altitude above the plain:</P>
<P>So is the Co-sine of the distance of that houre point from the Meridian of the plain, to the Co-sine of the Recli|nation; or to the Sine of the elevation of the Index above the plain.</P>
<P N="2">2. As the Radius, to the Sine of the Poles altitude above the plain:</P>
<P>So is the Co-tangent of the former distance (of the intended houre point from the Meridian of the plain,) to the Co|tangent of the declination of the Index from the Meridian of the plain. Or thus, 2.</P>
<P>As the Sine of the Poles altitude above the plain, to the Ra|dius, So is the Tangent of the former distance, to the Tan|gent of the declination of the Index from the plains Me|ridian.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="76">Thus,] suppose A B were the proper Meridian of the plain, make the angle B A C on the right Coast, and equall to the declination of the Index (now found) and elevate A D just perpendicularly over A C, to the angle D A C equall to the ele|vation of the Index above the plain, and so you shall place the Index in a just posi|tion, that it shall looke up into a just houre point of the Equinoctiall. That is the first thing.</P>

proper Meridian unto the houre of 12: that is, it is supposed to be turned so, as to looke into our 12 a clock point in the Equinoctiall: which point of 12 in the former figure was noted at L, and so in this figure let it be supposed again. I say, let it be supposed that (because the former Horologicall line was crossely divided, and therefore untoward for use) this way that is now spoken of shall be to take away that in|convenience in use which was in the former. And therefore suppose the. Style or Index to be wryed from the proper Meridian of the plain to the Meridian of the place, or to the point of 12. It may as well be put to any other just houre, as to 12, but be it so in this Example, and let the point be L selected from all the rest.</P>
<P>From the selected point L, draw the diameter L A M, and from the selected point L divide the Circle into 24 equall parts or houres. Then from each two houre points corre|spondently distant on both sides the Diameter L M draw right lines, as G <HI>h</HI> and <HI>n</HI> O, and G O, which will be all parallel to the Diameter L M. Draw these lines (I say) and continue them untill they meet with the horologicall line R A S, sufficiently prolonged both wayes. By this draught thus made, the horologicall line R A S shall be both pro|longed to <HI>h</HI> O, and also divided just as a line of Sines, so the parts of it are in the same proportion that the parts of the Diameter G A G are, which are Right Sines both wayes from the center, or Versed Sines from G through A to G.</P>
<P>&para; Note that here (as formerly) you may assume the Circle of what extent you list, and shall finde most fitting your purpose.</P>
<P>It is plain then by this Example, First, that the Radius
<PB N="144" REF="77">
of the Circle A R, is to be enlarged, according to the secant of the Equinoctiall distance between the proper Meridian of the plain, and that just hour (wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ever it be) inro which the Index is made to point. As you see that arke to be here L C, or G R, or G S, whose secant is A <HI>h,</HI> or A <HI>o,</HI> in respect of the assumed Radius A R. And secondly, that <HI>h o</HI> thus en|larged is divided like a double line of Sines, as it ought to be.</P>
<P>And for numbering the houres, if A be 12, and the In|dex look toward the South, then must <HI>o</HI> be 2, and the other <HI>o</HI> must be 6; and the first <HI>o,</HI> 10 at night. And <HI>h</HI> must be 9 in the morning; the other <HI>h,</HI> 6 in the morning; and the first <HI>h</HI> 3 in the morning.</P>
<P>But if the Index had not pointed up into 12 at L, but in|to some other hour as P, then must a Diameter have been drawn at first from P to the center A quite through, and all the houres parallel to P A, and then the horologicall line would have been thus numbered with 7 at the two extreams, and 1 in the midst at A.</P>

<P>And here is one speciall thing to be noted (as formerly <HI>Pag.</HI> 125) but this here is alwayes so, and in all Oblique Ho|rizons. That in our Climates where the dayes are in Sum|mer longer than 12 houres, the shadow of the Index doth really go forward and backward. As to make it plain. If the Diall were described upon an Horizontall plain (for instance) and it were our longest day, then the shadow of the Index

This for the placing, limiting, and dividing of the horologicall line.</P>

<P>&para; Thirdly, Concerning the Zodiac how it must be placed and limited, consider of these things. The Zodiac (in
<PB N="146" REF="78">
this case of wrying the Index from the plains proper Meridi|an) must be augmented in length, and changed in situation from what it was in the former case where the Index looked up into the plains proper Meridian. Yet I will here first begin with that way so far as it goes, and then proceed to what is further needfull. Let the Figure <HI>Pag.</HI> 137 be here repeated. To the Radius A R, the Tangent of 23 and a halfe is A F, and the same is there augmented thus.</P>
<P>As the Radius, To the Secant of the Poles elevation above the plain;</P>
<P>So let AF be supposed to be, To AB.</P>
<P>So that if the Index were pointing directly to the Meri|dian point (in the Equinoctiall) which is proper to the plain, then the businesse was at an end; for A B must be the length of the Zodiac, and standing square to R A S. But now we here suppose the Index to be wryed from that point, as much as the arke C L comes to; which turning aside will both lengthen the Zodiac again, and turn it out of its per|pendicular standing to R A S. Which thing is thus to be effected. To A F as a Radius, finde the Tangent of the Poles elevation above the plain; suppose that Tangent were G H. Then say, As the Radius, to the Tangent of C L the quantity of wrying, so G H to X Z. Make B K equall to X <HI>Z,</HI> and parallel to A R, and draw A K, so shall A K be the length, and shall also give (in this position) the situation of the Zodiac. The manner how to divide it need not be repeated, because it hath been often set down heretofore, You must only remember to place this line upon that Coast of A B which is contrary to the Coast of the Indexes devi|ation or wrying from the proper Meridian point of the plain: this work may either be protracted, or calculated, or wrought Instrumentally, as shall best be liked of.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="78"><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Another way I will here adde to do the same work, which may perhaps be not inferior to the former. Let all things preparatorie in the former Figure, be here again repeated, R A the Radius, and A F the Tangent of 23 degrees and a halfe to that Radius: then to A F as Radius, finde the Sine and Co-sine of the Poles elevation above the plain: let F P be the Sine, and A P the Co-sine. Make A <HI>m</HI> equall to A P; and from <HI>m</HI> draw the line <HI>m n,</HI> making the angle <HI>n m</HI> C e|quall to the angle B A C <HI>Pag.</HI> 142, and standing on the contrary Coast, which is the angle of the declination of the Index from A C in this Figure, the proper Meridian of the plain.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="79">Then say, As the Radius, is to the Tangent of the Recli|nation of the Index (which is the Complement of D A C (<HI>Pag.</HI> 142) the elevation of the Index above the plain,) So is the Sine F P to a fourth quantity, suppose the same to be D G: make <HI>m n</HI> equall to D G, and draw the streight line A <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> so shall A <HI>n</HI> in this Figure be equall to A K in the pre|cedent, and the angle <HI>n</HI> A C be (here) equall to the angle K A B in the former. So that A <HI>n</HI> must be the length of the halfe Zodiac, and will lie in its true position by this work. This may be done either by calculation, protraction, or In|strument, as all other works may also be. Care must alwayes be had to place these Zodiacs on the right Coast from F A C, and that the Zodiac be rightly divided and charactred accor|ding to the Seasons of the year, as they shall have respect to the nature of the plain.</P>
<P>Or thirdly, it may be done thus. First,</P>
<P N="1">1. As the Radius, To the bine of the Poles elevation above the plain;</P>
<P>So the Tangent of the Equinoctiall discession or wrying, To the Tangent of the Declination of the Zodiac; which is the angle <HI>n</HI> A C in this Figure, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> B A K in the former.</P>
<P N="2">2. As the Co-sine of the discession, or Equinoctiall wrying,</P>
<P>Is to the Radius; So is the Tangent of the Poles elevation above the plain,</P>
<P>To the Tangent of another Arke.</P>
<P N="3">3. And, As the Radius,</P>
<P>Is to the Secant of that arke (or as the Co-sine of that arke to the Radius;)</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="79">So is the Tangent of 23&frac12; <HI>gr.</HI> To a number.</P>
<P>If now you make the Radius of the Circle first assumed, namely R A or A S to be a Decimall scale, and out of that Decimall scale do take this number, the same shall give the length of the Zodiac A <HI>n</HI> in this figure, or A K in the former. The division of this Zodiac now it is thus placed and limited, must be done by the Tables and directions in the 4 and 5 Pa|ges. For A <HI>n</HI> must be taken as a Tangent of 23&frac12; <HI>gr.</HI> or as the number 4348 of a Decimall scale of 10000 parts.</P>
<P>Thus much for this kinde of Diall upon a streight line, both crossely and evenly divided.</P>

<P>_IN <HI>Pag.</HI> 28, <HI>Note</HI> 5, there is mention made of Po|lar plains or right Horizons, that in them, the Ellipsis closeth up into a right line. That right line is here the line that we have to do withall. For we here suppose alwayes that the Index pointeth up in|to the Equinoctiall Circle; and the Index we alwayes sup|pose to be a Zenith line, and therefore the Horizon proper to that Index as a Zenith line, must needs make right angles

w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th the Equinoctiall Circle, and must therefore be a right Horizon or Polar plain.</P>
<P>When the Index is pitched in a true posture, all the houre points of the Equinoctiall Circle must be supposed to have lines issuing from them all parallel to the Index. This is a ge|nerall truth in the whole course of the Ellipticall Dialling, Wherefore,</P>
<P>First of all, These lines will (in this case) fall all upon the plain of the Equinoctiall; and because the common section of any two plains must be a right line, therefore it is that all these lines so issuing, will fall upon one and the same streight line, namely, whensoever the Equinoctiall meets with or cuts any other plain. Hence comes it to be <HI>Rectilineal Horo|logiography,</HI> being performed upon a plain.</P>
<P>Secondly, Because they are all parallel to the Index, there|fore they must all be parallel to one another; and because they come originally from a Circle, and are parallel, they will all also keep distance one fro~ another as the Sines in a Circle do.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Because the Index moves alwayes in a parallel position to it selfe, and would shew the houre upon the cir|cular divisions of the Equinoctiall Circle (at all times of the year, that is, when this Equinoctiall is made to represent all other parallels of Declination) it must follow that the In|dex when (the shadow of) it falleth upon any one such point, it must also fall upon the whole line that issueth through that point. The reason is, because the line is alwayes parallel to the Index, therfore is it touch one point it must shadow the whol.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Hence will follow, that any line drawn upon the plain of the Equinoctiall, crossing those forementioned pa|rallel lines, shall be a line of Sines (or a double line of Sines, if you will rather expresse it properly) and if it passe through the center o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Equinoctiall Circle (where the Index also
<PB N="151" REF="82">
doth alwayes passe) then is such a line one of the Dials that we here are to deal with. Because every plain is taken for a great Circle cutting the Equinoctiall in the center. And the divisions of this line (the Sinicall divisions) must be the houre points, as is said before.</P>
<P>Now all that we have here to say is the making good of the former rules of limiting out and placing the houre line, the Zodiacall line, and the Index. If we therefore (in all cases) suppose the Index to be a Zenith line, and then an Horizon|tal plain to be placed perpendicular to it, this plain must be the proper Horizon to that Index (or Zenith line) and must (in these Cases here handled) go through the Axis of the world (a part of which I must call the primary Zodiac) and will cut the Equinoctiall plain in a right line placed perpendicularly to the Index, which I call the primary horizontall line.</P>
<P>And again, all that is done in other plains (not perpendi|cular to the Index) must be imagined primarily (or original|ly) to be deduced from this proper Horizontall plain.</P>
<P>First therefore, for the houre line. If the Index lie in the proper Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">idian of the plain (as is supposed in the first of the former Cases) then the Diameter of the Circle that is at first assumed, serves for the horologicall line without any altera|tion, because the proper Horizon, and the plain upon which you work, do (both of them) cut the Equinoctiall in one and the same line, which is to be the horologicall line. And there|fore in plain reason, so much of the Equinoctiall as the Index is wryed from this proper Meridian of the plain, so much of the same Equinoctiall must the proper Horizon be wryed with it, and consequently, so much will be between the proper horizontall line and the horologicall line of the plain, but still both these lines will continue upon the same plain of the Equinoctiall, and consequently they must in both
<PB N="152" REF="83">
cases be one and the same line, namely that which is made by the projection of the Equinoctiall Circle upon the plain, on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y it must b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> augmented according to the proper horizon|tall lines departure from the section of the plain with the E|quinoctiall, that is, according to the wrying of the Index, as is plain enough by what is said in the 142 <HI>Pag</HI>&punc; And so for the division of that line in the same Page. For G G and <HI>h o,</HI> do both lie in one and the same plain of the Equinoctiall: and all the projecture must be made parallel to the Index, whence <HI>h</HI> A is the secant (to G A Radius) of R G or C L, the wry|ing of the Index.</P>
<P>Then for the Zodiac, you are to deduce it from the Axis which is perpendicular to the Zenith line or Index: and from so much of it as containeth the Tangent of 23&frac12;<HI>gr.</HI> to the Radius G A. Now though the Index do keep the proper Meridian of the plain, yet the Axis is elevated above the plain. And because the projecture of that Tangent or part of the Axis must be parallel to the Index, therefore look what elevation the Axis or Pole of the World hath, to such a Secant of the Radius equall to the Tangent of 23&frac12; before mentioned must the Zodiac be extended. By which means the Index keeps the same situation and distance from the E|quinoctiall plain that it would do if it moved according to the proper and primary Tangents upon the Axis, and no o|therwise. And so doth the former enlarging of the horolo|gicall line produce the like effect, namely, that the Index doth upon that enlarged line shew the same houres that it would do upon the proper horizontall line.</P>
<P>Then for the Zodiac to a wryed Index, it is both displa|ced and enlarged too, according as right lines drawn through the divisions of the Axis, and parallel to the Index, would make a projection of it. According to which, there are three wayes given.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="83">The first makes A F equall to the Tangent of 23&frac12; to the Radius R A, to be Radius, and to that Radius findes F H, and to that again as Radius, finde H Z the Tangent of wry|ing. And so A Z is the Semizodiac placed and enlarged.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>The second makes A F as a Radius, and to it findes F P the Sine, and A P the Co|sine of the Axis his elevati|on above the plain. And then this line F P being perpen|dicular to the plain, it stands as the proper Zenith line of the plain. And because we are to cast all according to
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="154" REF="84">
the lying of the Index, therefore what reclination from the plains proper Zenith, and declination from the plains proper Meridian the Index hath, the same must the projection (or projecture) of the line F P have. That is, we may suppose the Index, or a line paral<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">el to the Index (in his true posture) to passe through the point F, and then we are to inquire where it will strike through the plain. That is to say, it must looke into the same Coast that the Index doth, and so the angle Z P Q being made equall to the declination of the In|dex from A Q the proper Meridian line, and the line P Z drawn, it is certain enough that the projecture of the point F must be upon the line P Z. And to know where, because F P Z is a right angle, and the side F P is known, with the angle I F M (equall to the reclination of the Index from the plains Zenith line F M) or P F Z; Therefore,</P>
<P>As F P Radius, To P Z the Tangent of the angle P F Z;</P>
<P>So is F P in the former known length (found to A F Tan|gent of 23&frac12; <HI>gr.</HI>) To P Z.</P>
<P>Therefore Z is the point terminating the extremity of the projected Zodiac, and so A Z must be the Semizodiac, ac|cording to what was delivered in the second way <HI>Pag.</HI> 147.</P>

<P>_IT hath been forwerly shewed (in the VIII. Section) how to make the Ellipticall Diall to any Index however placed, and to any Superficies flat or curved. That Doctrine will shew how to project this kinde of Re|ctilineall Diall (and the former Circular Diall too) onely I shall adde a word or two to shew that that way will produce a single line in this case, and such a line as must answer to a double line of Sines.</P>
<P N="1">1. See the 6 and 7 Propositions <HI>Pag.</HI> 95, 96. The first of them is to finde the Horizontall spaces. And in this case (because the Index lookes alwayes up into the Equinoctiall Circle) the Latitude of the Horizon proper to this Index line, is nothing. So that,</P>
<P>As the Sine of the Poles elevation, which is nothing, Is to the Radius;</P>
<P>So is the Tangent of each houre from the proper Meridian of the Index,</P>
<P>To the Tangent of an infinite length: [For so it must be because the first term is 00.]</P>
<P>Which infinite Tangent is belonging to 90 <HI>gr.</HI> therefore it will follow that all the houres and each of them are 90 <HI>gr.</HI> from the proper Meridian of the Index: that is, that they
<PB N="157" REF="85">
are all coincident into one line, which is perpendicular to the proper Meridian of the Index. This shews that this Dial will be a single line, and that by the former generall Do|ctrine, Section VIII.</P>
<P N="2">2. Then for the second thing, that it will be a line of Sines, or (though a curved line, yet) to be thence deduced or divided, it will appear by the seventh Proposition <HI>Pag.</HI> 96. Because,</P>
<P>As the Radius, To the Co-sine of the Poles elevation; which here is the Radius;</P>
<P>So the Co-sine, &amp;c. To the same term again.</P>
<P>For if the two first terms be the same, then the two latter must be equall too. And since the third terms are a line of Sines, the fourth terms (which are to divide the Diall line) being the same with the third, will be also such as will make a line of Sines. So this is made good likewise.</P>
<P>And there may other wayes be found to effect this same thing upon a curved Superficies. As first to project the E|quinoctiall line or section with the uneven supersicies, upon the said Superficies: and when that is done, to lay the edge of some boa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d or ruler, in the Superficies of the Equinocti|all, with the Index lying in the plain of the Equinoctiall, will (by the former Equinoctiall line drawn) direct you in, and afterwards to proceed answerably to the nature of the Diall, &amp;c.

<HEAD>How to lay a line that shall point up to any assigned place or point in the heavens.</HEAD>
<P>THis is usefull for the laying of an Index to any conditi|on that shall be required: namely, so as to cut through any just houre, either in the Equinoctiall Circle, or any o|ther Circle in the heavens.</P>
<P>The first work must be to finde what Reclination and De|clination the said point shall have in respect of our own Ze|nith and Meridian.

<P>The next work is, how to lay or stretch a line to any given Declination and Reclination. The way that for the pre|sent I think on shall be this.</P>
<P>First, Assigne any point from which you will have that your line shall rise, as at A, then by a perpendicular threed c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st a shadow through A, as C A, and draw therethrough an obscure line: and having before drawn an horizontall line through A, as is B A; apply some plain board or past-board to that line B A, and upon it project with your eye the Verticall C A by your perpendicular threed (you need

<P>Afterwards, knowing what Azimuth this is (which you may finde by taking the Suns altitude just when the shadow C A was drawn) you may upon your pastboard set off (from it) your Azimuth of the lines declination, suppose it to be A E. Then again applying your pastboard to his former true position, with your perpendicular threed, you may transfer (or project) A E from the pastboard to the plain: suppose one point of that transferred Azimuth were at F, then draw the line A F, which is the section of that Azimuth (with the plain) in which Azimuth the Index or streight line must lie,

<P>That though the Index A C should not lie upon a just houre, but otherwise accidentally, yet because the houre points are upon a Circle, the houres will be distant from each other, and not breed that distraction in computing that was before noted necessarily to fall upon the streight horolo|gicall line. And so you are left at liberty to set your Index how you will, only so as ever to looke into one and the same

Meridian Circle. But you must then be carefull to place some one houre line true, so as to answer to some just houre circle in the heavens, which upon this Equinoctiall plain (when the Axis is once truly placed) will be easie. For if the Axis give a shadow, and you at the same instant time (noting the shadow) do observe the houre, that shadow will repre|sent the same houre. If therefore upon that shadow line (as a Diameter) you describe a Circle, you may (from the inter|sections of the said line, with the Circle) set off any one full and just houre, and then from that just houre you may di|vide the Circle into the 24 houres. This equall setting of the Index is allowable upon the Circle, but not upon the right lines D E or F G, for in them there will be confusion of parts, which in the Circle are distant.</P>
<P>Note further, that you need not make the Center of the horologicall Circle just in the point A, where the extremity of the Index which came down upon the plain, but you may make it in any point where the Index A C will touch the plain, as at H, or in other like places.</P>

<P>You must account the Semidiameter D A of the horolo|gicall Circle to be as Radius. And to that length (and none other) you must make the length of the Semizodiac A B up|on the Axis to be the Tangent of 23 and a halfe, and by that Scale of Tangents you must put in the Sines or moneths as hath been often shewed before. And whereas I have hitherto said that the Index must move upon the Axis, and agree to a Zodiac thereon inscribed, it must be understood that in some sense this is necessary, but in some sense not so. As thus, The Index D A or D E, must alwayes move per|pendicular
<PB N="165" REF="88">

<P>A X the Axis. A C the Zodiac. A D the Index, A B another supporter differing from the Axis.</P>
</FIGURE>
to the Axis A X. But it is not tied to move
upon the Axis it selfe. It may move according to any line
that lies in the same plain with the Index D E and the Axis
A X, that is, it may move according to the line A B, which
we here suppose to be in the same plain or Meridian with
A D and A X. This condition is alwayes requisite, and it
must ever keep one &amp; the same angle with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ight line A B,
and such an angle that may keepe it alwayes perpendicular to
the true Axis, that is, parallel to the Equinoctiall plain.
And this being observed, you may insert the Zodiac upon
the line A B, but it must be proportioned from the Axis
A X, thus; As A C Radius, to A E the Secant of the an|gle
C A E, so is A C the Tangent of 23 and a halfe (in
respect of the Radius of the horologicall Circle,) to a fourth
quantity; the length whereof gives A E. And now this line
A E must be esteemed as a Tangent of 23 degrees and a half,
and by it must the Semizodiac or halfe year be put in, as
hath been shewed formerly. So this is done also, For the
Index will move upon A E, according to the parts upon A
C, as it is bound to do. Only note that these Dials upon
the Equinoctiall plains can serve but halfe a year upon one
side&punc; &amp; therefore for the other half year you must do the like
work upon the under side of the Equinoctiall plain. The
<PB N="166" REF="89">
work I say is like without any reall difference, and therefore
there will need no more words concerning it.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>For DEMONSTRATION of these things.</HEAD>
<P>_THere needs nothing to be added more than what hath formerly been done for Rectilineal Dials. For what is done there in the proper Horizon (proper to the Index I mean) by a line of Sines, is here expressed by the line of Sines D A E, <HI>Pag.</HI> 162: only there, all the lines issuing from the Equinoctiall houre points did meet with the proper Horizontal plain, and did thereon create a single line of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">80 Sines, and so the Equinoctiall Circle standing towards the eye (being infinitely removed from it) edgewise is projected upon his own diameter, and appears nothing else but as a Diameter (or streight line) to the eye. But here the same forementioned parallel lines issuing from the houre points of the Equinoctiall Circle, and flowing out upon the plain of that Circle, do so appear in full view to the eye, because the eye stands so as fully to view the said plain and not looking edgewise upon it. When the plain stood edgewise to the eye, the eye did project it into the Diameter, but now we conceive the eye to stand only to looke what was effected upon the plain by the former Pro|jection.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="89">And further. Looke what projection was formerly made (in this case of the Indexes pointing into the Equinoctiall Circle) upon the Indexes proper Horizon, and was there received by a streight line, the same is here done by drawing the Diameter D A E, <HI>Pag.</HI> 162, which line must be suppo|sed to be the common section of the Indexes proper Ho|rizon with the Equinoctiall plain. And so in effect both these Cases are nothing different.</P>
<P>Then for the line F G, the parts of it, and the points of the Circle, and the points of D E must necessarily all fall in|to one houre line, and all shew the true houre (whichsoever of them you take for your Horologicall line) because as the lines issuing from the houre points of the Equinoctiall are all parallel one to the other, and all again to the Index, there|fore if any part of the shadow of the Index do fall upon any part of one of those lines, the whole shadow must fall upon the whole line, and consequently the correspondent points upon D E and F G and the Circle, will all joyntly, or each of them severally, give the houre of the day. Other things are plain enough.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the parallelisme of the Index and Plain.</HEAD>
<P>It must further be noted, that an Index may be made to point up into the Equinoctiall Circle, and yet also be paral|lel to any plain whatsoever. For every plain cuts the Equi|noctiall Circle somwhere: Now if an Index be made to lie in that common section of these two Circles or plains, then will it lie parallel both to the Equinoctiall plain and to the other plain, and it may be made to move alwayes paral|lel to them both, if it be moved at right angles to any line that shall stand perpendicular to the said common Section.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="90">But for all this, there can no such Diall (as we have now spoken of) be made upon any other plain besides the Equi|noctiall. I say there can no parallelisme of the Index to the plain be (in this kinde of Dialling) allowed, more than what is said may be done upon the Equinoctiall plain.</P>
<P>For though the Index may be parallel to the Equinoctial and plain both, yet the Equinoctiall it selfe must make an|gles with all such plains. And because the Index is parallel to the common Section, therefore all the houre points pro|jected by parallel lines to the Index, must be upon the Equi|noctiall plain it selfe, and must run parallel to the line of com|mon section: that is, they will all run so, as never to meet so much as with the line of common section (which line is upon the Equinoctiall plain) much lesse ever to meet with any part of the plain it selfe, which is every where distant more or lesse from the Equinoctiall, except only in the line of common section. So that there is no more to be said of this subject.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">

</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Things that are pre-requisite to this work.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. You must know the situation of your plain, that is, what Declination and Reclination it hath in respect of your own Horizon. This is to be done the ordinary way, as in all plains is usuall.</P>
<P N="2">2. You must know the Declination and Reclination of your Index. That is, if the Index be set casually you must then finde out the Declination and Reclination thereof, which is shewed, <HI>Pag.</HI> 80. how it must be done, namely, by observation from the Sun, and cannot be otherwise perfor|med. Or if you choose a Longitude and Latitude wherein to lay your Index, then must you (by that Longitude and Latitude given) finde what Declination and Reclination is due thereunto, in respect of your own Horizon: and accor|ding to this Declination and Reclination you are to lay your Index. See the Schemes <HI>Pag.</HI> 83, 84, for by those or the like you are to conceive of your Sphericall work in this kinde.</P>
<P N="3">3. Having thus found the situation both of plain and In|dex, in respect of your own Horizon, you must then finde what situation the Index hath in respect of the plain; that is, what Declination it hath from the proper Meridian of the plain, and what Reclination it hath from the Plains Zenith. This Proposition hath not been handled before, but must be put here in this place.</P>
<P>Let your own Horizon be N W S E, the Zenith Z, the Pole P, and let A V E be a declining reclining plain, whose Declination and Reclination we now suppose to be known
<PB N="173" REF="92">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
by former rules; that is the angle S Z D (equall to the Declination) is known, and Z V or D T (equall to the Reclination) is known. So that in the Triangle P Z T, there is P Z (equal to the complement of P N, the Poles altitude,) Z T (equal to the complement of Z V the Reclination,) &amp; P Z T (equall to the com|plement of S Z T, the plains Declination from the South:) therefore you may now finde the three unknown quantities; namely, P T the com|plement of the Poles elevation above the plain: and Z P T, the distance of the plains Meridian from yours, which is the plains difference of Longitude: and lastly, Z T P the di|stance of P T the plains proper Meridian from V Z T the Verticall line of the plain. Or which three soever you have, you may finde the other three. As having the difference of the plains Longitude, the angle P, with the plains Lati|tude the complement of P T: and <HI>P Z</HI> the complement of your own Latitude. You may finde all the rest. And by that means you may set a plain to any Latitude and difference of Longitude, that is answering to the Horizon of any known place in the world.</P>
<P>The next work is to finde what situation an Index (set up upon the plain) shall have to the plain, and the fundamental lines thereon described, <HI>viz.</HI> the Verticall line, and proper Meridian.</P>
<P>I suppose first, that the Declination and Reclination of
<PB N="174" REF="93">
the Index (in respect of your own Horizon) is known by the former things already spoken of, and from thence you may gather what is here required. Thus</P>
<P>Let the Index point up to X: and let Z X (the reclination from your Zenith) be known, and S Z X (the declination from your Meridian) be also known. Now therefore in the triangle T Z X, there are three things known.</P>
<P N="1">1 T Z the Complement of the Plains reclination in re|spect of your Horizon.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>Z</HI> X the complement of the Indexes reclination in re|spect of your Horizon.</P>
<P N="3">3 Thirdly, the angle T <HI>Z</HI> X, which is the difference of the two declinations, namely of the plain and of the Index. By these all the rest will be found; as namely,</P>
<P N="1">1 T X, the reclination of the Index X from <HI>T</HI> the pole of the plain, which is called the proper reclination of the In|dex.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>Z</HI> T X, or V Y, or rather V M, which shews how much the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Subindicall line I call that line upon the plain which lies perpendi|cularly under the Index, as the substilar doth under the Stile. I mean perpen|dicularly in respect of the plain, not of the Horizon.</NOTE> Subindicall line lies from the Verticall line of the plain (in degrees of a Circle described upon the plain) and consequently, because P T Z was known before, therefore P T X is now also become known, which shewes the decli|nation of the * Subindicall line from the plains proper Me|ridian, which may therefore be called the proper declination of the Index.</P>
<P N="3">3 The angle <HI>Z</HI> X <HI>T</HI> (if it be of any use here) shews how much (in Azimuthal position) your Zenith <HI>Z</HI> lies from <HI>T,</HI> the Zenith of the plain upon that Hotizon whose Zenith line is the same with the Index, which is therefore the proper Horizon to the Index.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="175" REF="93">
<HEAD>Or if you would set an Index so as to fit it to any assigned difference of Longitude, and to any assigned Latitude also, you must work thus.</HEAD>
<P>LEt X P S be the assigned difference of Longitude, and P X the complement of the Latitude, into both which the Index shall point up in X. Because the plains difference of Longitude <HI>Z</HI> P <HI>T.</HI> is known before, therefore the angle T P X is known. And P T the complement of the plains Latitude is also before known. Therefore in the triangle T P X these three things are known, <HI>viz.</HI> P X, P <HI>T,</HI> and the interjacent angles T P X. By which three you may finde all the other quantities: namely, <HI>P T</HI> X, or B Y, the de|parture of the Subindicall line from the plains proper Me|ridian: <HI>T</HI> X the proper reclination of the Index X from T the pole of the plain, or the complement of it (X Y) which is the elevation of the Index above the plain just over (per|pendicularly over in respect of the plain) the Subindicall line: with the angle <HI>P</HI> X <HI>T</HI> (if there were any use of it) which shewes how much the pole of the plain declines from the proper Meridian of the Index. I say, it shewes this de|clination upon that Horizon (whatever it should be) which shall be properly belonging or perpendicularly placed to the said Index as the proper Zenith-line.</P>
<P>Thus the situation of the Index (whether casually, or by election set) is found to the true coasts of the plain it self.</P>

the Zodiacall Scale depends upon this one Rule. Namely,</P>
<P>To project the houre points of the Equinoctiall, and the Zodiacall Scale upon the Axis (which Zodiacall Scale upon the Axis it self is made by the Tangents of 23 <HI>gr.</HI> and an half, to the Radius of that Sphere wherein you shall imagine your Circles to be) I say. To project (all such points) upon the plain, by lines passing through each one of them, and all and each of the same lines to be drawn parallel to the Index given. This is the summe of what is here now to be done, and of what hath been done formerly quite through this Book. For all that is before effected upon any plain or cur|ved Superficies, is nothing more then what I have now said; namely, a determining of the true places of every such (houre and Zodiacall) point, as they shall be projected upon the Dialls Superficies, by lines going through them, and going parallel also to the Index that is to give the houre. For so, the Equinoctiall Circle will very well supply every parallel of the Sun, the Index and horologicall line being rectified by the Zodiac in a true site one to the other, as hath been often mentioned before; And then the Index, casting its shadow upon the houre point, either in the Equino|ctiall or in the parallel Circle, must also cast it upon the whole projecting line, which passeth th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ough the hour point, (because that line is made alwayes parallel to the Index) and consequently upon that point of the houre, which (by the said line) is carried to the Diall-Superficies. And so for the points of the Zodiac, they are also projected in such manner, as that the Index moving in them (however they may seem to stand awry and out of order) shall alwayes cut the Axis of the World (if it were there placed) and cut it according to the Tangents of declination thereon expr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ssed. And this will serve for a brief demonstration of that work which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow to come afterwards.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="95">In which we are first to bring down the houre points and Zodiac to the plain considered as an Horizon, and the pro|jection of those points to be made into an Ellipsis, by lines all perpendicular to the said plain, that is, parallel to the plains proper Zenith line. Secondly, we are to project or transpose these first (both Houre and Zodiacall) points from the primary Ellipsis into a secondary Ellipsis, such as the position of the true intended Index will require: And so also the points of the Zodiac must be dealt withall.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>How to make an Ellipticall Diall upon any Plain, to an Index perpendicular to the Plain.</HEAD>
<P>THe first work is done before, partly by Calculation, and partly by protraction, <HI>Pag.</HI> 25, 26, but more fully and better, <HI>Proposition</HI> 5, 6, 7, <HI>Pag.</HI> 92, 95, 96, by which you make two Tables, one of Horizontal spaces, the other of Altitudes. So that I shall not need to say any more of it. By that work (I say) you may make two Tables which may serve to prick down the houre points, which points you shall see to winde about the center in forme of an Ellipsis.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is first requisite that the pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">per Meridian of the plain be rightly situated upon the plain (as is there also ex|pressely required. And it is again requisite that the proper line of the two sixes (proper I mean to the plain, considered as an Horizon by it selfe) be also drawn: which line (as in all Horizontal Dials is usuall) must be perpendicular (upon the plain) to the proper Meridian. And the points also of the
<PB N="178" REF="96">
two sixes must be carefully set on, whose distance from the center is the longer Radius of the Ellipsis. The reason why these points of the proper Sines must be had, is, because the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ew Ellipsis (which we now look for) must passe through them both. So also the just point of the proper 12 (or the section of the Ellipsis with the plains proper Meridian) must be with the same care designed upon the plain. And the Subindicall line must be drawn in its true position upon the plain, according to the proper declination of the Index.</P>
<P N="2">2. After this is done, you must call to minde what the Declination and Reclination of your Index is (I speak now of the proper Declination and Reclination before mentioned) as <HI>Pag.</HI> 172 is mentioned.</P>
<P N="3">3. Then from every houre point lately made upon the plain, you are to draw right lines, parallel to the subindicall line, and draw them both wayes or on both sides of each houre point, because you know not which of them (as yet) you are to make use of for the pricking down of your New or Distorted Ellipsis.</P>
<P N="4">4. Take the larger Radius of your primary Ellipsis (that is the length from the center of it, to the point of the proper six a clock) and (upon the Sector, for that Instrument is most fit for this use or practise) entering it upon the Tan|gent of 45 degrees, open your Sector to tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> length: then take over from the reclination of the Index (the proper reclination I now speak of) counted on the same Scale of Tangents, to the other leg, and reserve this length. That is, As the Radius, to the Tangent of the proper reclination of the Index; So is the larger Semidiameter of the primary El|lipsis, to a fourth quantity, which is equall to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rmer reserved length, and to that large Semidiameter or Radius, is the Tangent of the Indexes proper Reclination.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="179" REF="96">5. This reserved length must again be entered from 90 in the line of Sines, and the Sector set according to it, and being so set it is fit for the rest of the work that is to ensue. Because this proportion we are to go upon: As the Radius, to the Tangent of the Indexes proper reclination (which two terms are they that now do set the Sector,) so is the Sine of every altitude of the horary points in the Equinoctiall, (which altitudes your Table of altitudes computed by the foremen|tioned Proposition, <HI>Pag.</HI> 96, 97, will help you unto,) so is the Sine of every (horary-equinoctiall-points) altitude, to the Tangent of the reclination of every one of those severall houre points of the Equinoctiall Circle. Note that the re|clinations here mentioned are, in respect, and from the proper Zenith line of the plain. And note also that these Tangents thus found, are to be estimated to the larger semidiameter of the primary Ellipsis as to their proper Radius.</P>
<P N="6">6. By these Tangents so found, you are to set on the new houre points, by which both the new Ellipsis is to be descri|bed and also divided. I say the new houre points are to be set on upon the lines drawn through each of the old houre-points parallel to the Subindicall line, and they are to be s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t on from each of the said old houre points in those lines. But which way, or on which side of them, will be still doubted&punc; as was before mentioned &sect; 3. And to take away this doubt, it will be best to consider the point of the proper 12 upon the primary Ellipsis, when the Sun is (any day) in that pro|per 12 point of the heavens, then must the upright (or pro|per Index of the plain) cast its shadow into the proper 12 point of the primary Ellipsis. Then further, supposing the Sun to stand still there, imagine how your slope Index is to lie from the proper Index, and by that you shall easily dis|cern which way the inclination of that Index will wry the
<PB N="180" REF="97">
proper point of 12 from the primary Ellipsis, and conse|quently you shall be able (thereby) to judge upon which part of that line which is drawn through the point of proper 12 (parallel to the subindicall line) the houre (of proper 12) shall be cast into the secondary Ellipsis from the primary. This point being set right, you may place all the houre points from that proper 12 to the two proper sixes, the same way with this first point: but all the other points on the remo|ter side of the proper 12, must go the contrary way, as you will easily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erceive, the very figure of the Ellipsis will re|quire it should so be.</P>
<P>As here. R S is the Subindical line, over which the Index leaneth.</P>
<P>O the point of proper 12 upon P O Q the prima|ry Ellipsis.</P>
<P>O A, 9 B, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> C, &amp;c. parallel lines through the houre points in the primary Ellipsis, parallel I say to the Subindicall line R S.</P>
<P>P Q the two proper fixes, through which alwayes the distorted Ellipsis must passe.</P>
<P>Then because the Index leaneth from the upright Index (or Zenith line of the plain) towards S, therefore the proper 12 at O must go towards S, <HI>viz.</HI> to A: and therefore also 9 B, 8 C, &amp;c. 11 G, &amp;c. must go the same way till you come to the two proper sixes at P and Q, and then the houre points D E F must be set from 3 2 1, the contrary way to that wherein the first houres were placed; as you may plainly see the form of the new Ellipsis will require. For it cannot possibly be made to turn again from P towards M, if it must make up an Ellipsis, as in this case it is necessa|ry it should do.</P>
<P>Now all the Tangents before found (&sect; 5) are the lines
<PB N="181" REF="97">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
10 H, 9 B, 8 C, 11 G, &amp;c. each set off from his proper houre point at O, A, B, C, and taken to its true Radius, namely, the Radius P R or R Q. But if you work by the Sector (as is taught in the 5 &sect;) the very lengths there found shall be the quantities here to be set off, namely, 10 H, 9 B, 8 C, 11 G, 12 N, &amp;c. without any more relation to the Radius P R, without any more relation (I say) than what was formerly done upon the work of the Sector &sect; 5. The like may be done for halves and quarters of houres. And so these directions will be enough for pricking down the houre points this way.</P>
<P>Another way followeth.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="182" REF="98">
<HEAD>A second way to make the Ellipsis and houres to a slope Index upon a plain: and without trouble of making that Table before men|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ioned.</HEAD>
<P>_THis way will be more expedite than the former. I shall here suppose these particulars to be again done by the former precepts.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the plains proper Meridian R O, is rightly placed.</P>
<P N="2">2. That P R Q is drawn perpendicular thereunto.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the Subindicall line R S is also rightly placed from R O the proper Meridian.</P>
<P N="4">4. That R P or R Q being determined for the Radius, R O and R K are each of them the Sines of the plains pro|pet Latitude.</P>
<P N="5">5. From the points O and K (which are the two proper points of 12 to an Index standing perpendicularly to the plain) let O A and K L be drawn parallel to R S the Subin|dicall line.</P>
<P N="6">6. Then to the Radius R P, finde the Sine of the plains difference of Longitude from your Meridian [because I pur|pose here to shew how to work all from your 12 a clock line, though there is no obligation to that houre, but all may be done just in the same manner from any other houre point, if you account the plains difference of Longitude from some one of them, which is easie to do: as if in this Example the
<PB N="183" REF="98">
difference of Longitude from 12 be 36 <HI>gr.</HI> then from 11 it must be 21 <HI>gr.</HI> from 10 it must be 6 <HI>gr.</HI> from 1 a clock it must be 51 <HI>gr.</HI> &amp;c. to all or any of the other houres] which here for example sake we will say to be 36 <HI>gr.</HI> With that Sine set off R T, and draw T I parallel to R O the proper Meridian. Then again to the Radius R O, finde out the Co-sine of the difference of Longitude, and set it upon the line T I, from T to I. All this work is only to finde the point of 12 in the primary Ellipsis, as you see it expressed in the former Figure at 12. The like work you must do to finde the point of one of the houres of six in the primary El|lipsis, because six is 90 <HI>gr.</HI> from 12. [If you had chosen the point of 11 to work by, you must have lookt for the point of 5 a clock, because that point is the 90^t^h <HI>gr.</HI> from 11, if 10, then 4, &amp;c.] That is, to the Radius R O finde the Sine of the difference of Longitude, and set it from R to V, and then draw V X parallel to P R the line of the plains pro|per six. Then to the Radius R P finde the Co-sine of the said difference of Longitude. and set it upon V X from V to X: So shall X be the point of your own six a clock upon the proper Ellipsis; as you may see in the Figure is expres|sed.</P>

<HEAD>Concerning the <HI>Zodiac,</HI> how it is to be limited and placed.</HEAD>
<P>TO omit other wayes, I shall here pitch upon that which is most suitable to this manner of working upon which we now are. To the Radius P R (which is the larger Semi|diameter of the primary Ellipsis) first, finde the Tangent of 23 degrees and a halfe; which suppose to be R &xgr;: and then to this line, being taken as a new Radius, finde the Co-sine of the plains Latitude, or the Sine of the Equinoctials alti|tude, which suppose to be the length R W, which is also to be set from the center R upon the proper Meridian of the plain, as here it is from R to W. Then through the point W, draw a line, as W Z, parallel to the subindical line R S.
<PB N="186" REF="100">
When this is done you are to finde the Sine of the Poles ele|vation above the plain, to the same Radius R &xgr;, which Sine you may suppose to be the length of the line &phgr; &psgr;. Then say again; As the Radius, to the Tangent of the Indexes reclination; so &phgr; &psgr; (the Sine of the Poles elevation above the plain) to a fourth line; which line let be represented by &lgr; &ohgr;. Take this line &lgr; &ohgr; therefore, and set it upon W Z, the line formerly drawn, from W to Z. And lastly, draw the line R Z, and make R <HI>y</HI> equall to it, so shall <HI>Z y</HI> be the Zodiac in its true length and position: and R <HI>Z</HI> or R <HI>y</HI> shall give the halfe of it, which halfe is to be estimated as a Tan|gent of 23 degrees and a halfe, and so the Zodiac to be set on as hath formerly been often shewed.</P>
<P>You are here to take care that all things be set in their right position. In this example, Z turns from W towards the left hand, because it is here supposed that the North Pole is elevated upon the plain, and so the Axis riseth out of R a|bove the plain: and therefore that 23&frac12; tangent degree upon that Axis a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e above the plain. From which extream point of 23&frac12; above the plain, you may suppose a line to issue out parallel to the Index, which inclines from R towards S, and therefore that line inclining so too, must project that extream point from W towards <HI>Z.</HI> All the reason of the work de|pends upon that which hath been formerly said: Namely, that both houre points of the Equinoctiall, and declination points in the Axis, are all projected from their true positions in the Sphere (upon or unto a plain) by right lines passing through each of them, parallel to the assigned Index.

<HEAD>How the Zodiac is to be placed and limited.</HEAD>
<P>IT is the same work with that which went before, <HI>Pag.</HI> 185. yet I will here insert it again.</P>
<P>First, work thus.

Take therefore that length F W, and set it from R to X on the North side (in this example:) and through X draw X &ggr; parallel to the Subindicall line R S.</P>
<P>Then say again. As the Radius, is to the Tangent of 23 <HI>gr.</HI> and an half; So let R C (which was before found to be the Sine of the Latitude of the place 51 <HI>gr.</HI> and an half in respect of the Radius R 6, and comes now to be here used again) be to a fourth quantity, which suppose to be F <HI>z.</HI> Take therefore F <HI>z,</HI> and set it upon the line formerly drawn through X, from X, contrary to the going of the Subindical line, namely Southward (in this example) I say from X to &ggr; Then from &ggr; through R, draw &ggr; R &pgr;, and make R &pgr; equall to R &ggr;, So shall &ggr; &pgr; be the Zodiac both placed rightly and justly limited.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="104">For division of it, you must conceive that R &ggr; or R &pgr; is a Tangent of 23 and an half <HI>gr.</HI> the Suns greatest declination, and consequently you may by it set on either 12 moneths, or 12 signes, as you will; the manner whereof hath been often shewed in this Book, and especially <HI>Pag.</HI> 10, 11. and <HI>Pag.</HI> 14, 15, &amp;c. so that now all this work is come to an end. The Index must slide to and fro upon the line &ggr; &pgr; (or the Index standing, the Ellipsis must move after the same rate) &ggr; &pgr; is the proper Meridian of the Index. And if your work (when you make this Diall, according to this case here be|fore put) be exactly true, you shall finde the Zodiacall line &pgr; &ggr; to fall just into the houre lines of 5 and 7, as they ought to do, because the difference of the Indexes Longitude was assumed to be 75 <HI>gr.</HI> from the South Meridian of the place, which is the same with those houres.</P>
<P>The signe &Cancer; must be placed at &ggr;, and &Aries; at &pgr; in this Diall.</P>
<P>The Index must lie (when it is in the Center R) just over the line R S, and must alwayes move in a parallel position to it self.

<P>I have here set two of them, whose proper Meridians, (I mean proper to the Index, which are the lines of their Zodiacs, <HI>viz.</HI> &ggr; &pgr;) do not lie in one and the same right line, or parallelism (which is the samenesse of po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ition) but make angles one to the other.

<P>I have set that whose Index looks North-east upon the left hand, you may set it on the right hand if you will, and the other on the left. For this makes no materiall change.</P>

<P>To this length N T as a Radius, finde out the Secant of the forementioned arke 27 <HI>gr.</HI> 45 <HI>min.</HI> which suppose to be N V.</P>
<P>This length N V shall give the Radius or Tangent of 45 <HI>gr.</HI> which is the Tangent or Decimall Scale, out of which (either of them) you are to make your Zodiac by the num|bers of those Tables in the 6 and 7 <HI>Pages.</HI></P>
<P>To this Radius or Decimall Scale, or Tangent of 45 <HI>gr.</HI> N W is the Tangent of 23 <HI>gr.</HI> and a halfe, wherefore the Semizodiac, R L or R M is to be made equall in length to N W. Thus the Zodiacs length is limited.</P>
<P>For the position of the Zodiac, it was before said, that it
<PB N="200" REF="108">
must lie in the line of 7 in the morning, or 5 in the after|noon. So in this last figure you see it points to Z, which is 7 in the morning, (and consequently also to X, which is 7 in the evening) in the distorted Ellipsis: because this is that Diall whose Index looks North-east: you see it do so likewise in the first figure <HI>Pag.</HI> 189, as in the second figure there it lies to 5 in the evening, and consequently also to 5 in the morning.</P>
<P>Observe in the last figure (which is as true and just in the two other <HI>Pag.</HI> 189.) that the angle P R Z, and so Q R X, is equall to the angle made (upon our common Horizontall Diall) between 6 and 7 a clock, namely, 18<HI>gr.</HI> 54 <HI>min.</HI> and consequently that 1 R 1 (a line drawn from 1 to 1 in the primary Ellipsis) is perpendicular to the Zodiac L M: but P R C is not equall to the angle thereon between 6 and 8 a clock; nor is it so in any other of the houres.</P>
<P>Observe again, that if a line be drawn parallel to O K. through A the point of 12 in the distorted Ellipsis, till it meet with the Zodiac (extended) at <HI>y</HI>; observed (I say) that if R M be taken as a Tangent of 23&frac12; <HI>gr.</HI> (as it is taken in this work) then will R <HI>y</HI> be the Tangent of (the comple|ment of your Latitude, namely) 38 <HI>gr.</HI> 30 <HI>min.</HI> And this must be so, because if the Sun should decline 38 <HI>gr.</HI>30 <HI>min.</HI> Southward, then the Sun must only peep up upon the Ho|rizon at 12, and consequently the shadow of the Index (namely the point of it that intersects with your Horizon, for the Sun hath no altitude at that place and time) must run full from South to North to shew the point of 12 at A.</P>
<P>Other observations might be made, but I go no further.</P>
<P>The reason of the precedent work will be demonstrated out of the former things delivered in this Book: especially out of this last Treatise, which begins <HI>Pag.</HI> 171, and ends
<PB N="201" REF="108">
<HI>Pag.</HI> 186. And therefore I wholly omit to adde any thing more to this particular subject.</P>
<P>They that understand the things before, will not be to seeke in the necessary Demonstrations of these particulars.</P>

<HEAD>A Note concerning the framing of Dials to finde the <HI>Azimuth.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_AS the Axis of the world is to the Equinoctial Cir|cle, so is the Zenith line to the Horizon of any place.</P>
<P>Whence it will follow: That whatsoever is in this Book declared concerning the projection of the houre points of the Equinoctiall Circle upon any plain, &amp;c. the same may be applied to the projection of Azimuths or points of the Horizon upon any plain, &amp;c. Onely <HI>mutatis mutandis,</HI> (<HI>i.e.</HI>) instead of the Equinoctiall and Poles of the World, you are to use the Horizon and the Poles of it, (<HI>i.e.</HI>) Zenith and Nadir.</P>
<P>Then for the Zodiac (which depends upon the Scale or Tangents of Declination, which exceed not 23 and a half <HI>gr.</HI> you are to use (in the Azimuthal work) a Scale of Tan|gents (rightly limited) going up from oo to so much alti|tude as you mean to use (if it be for the Suns course, to 62 <HI>gr.</HI> here at <HI>London.</HI>)</P>
<P>As there you rectifie the Index to the Declination of the Sun: So here you must (answerably) rectifie it to the Suns altitude taken by observation, and then the Index being set
<PB N="202" REF="109">
to the altitude gives the Azimuth for that moment and no more.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="corollary">
<HEAD>COROLLARY.</HEAD>
<P>Therefore, to finde the Azimuth by this way, you must take the Suns Altitude, and so finde the Azimuth for one moment onely.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> But why is there so little said here of this?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Because it is a thing of no use, but of a great deal of trouble: for the altitude is to be observed, and the In|dex set thereto every moment,</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> Is it not so too in the Dials before described?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> No; for there the Index set once, may serve in that place one whole day very well, because the Suns decli|nation doth not alter much in one day.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> Why then is this Azimuthal businesse mentioned at all?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Because the Reader might see, that the Authour of this Treatise was not ignorant of it: yet it is mentioned also that if any delight in such a curiosity he may to his li|king effect it.</P>
<P>&para; And for a full conclusion note, that, All the former Dials may be made in a Craticular way.</P>
