<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend SIR:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THe Meditations here in this Treatise pre|sented to you, are at their highest pitch of ambition, if they may obtaine, that your judicious eyes (at your con|venient
<PB REF="3">
leasure) shall passe over them. I suppose, it will be asked why they solicit you rather then any other, for this favour. It is, first for your many yeares with which GOD hath crowned you: and then also in respect of your experience in your owne particu|lar, of what in this Tract is deli|ver'd: that is, of GODS free|ing this age from the Imputations cast (in a generality) upon it: and his deyning you above many others, the blessed and comforta|ble priviledges, of which it is ca|pable, and for which it hath the best helps, and most opportunities. I desire not to be made knowne un|to you. It sufficeth, that to me you
<PB REF="3">
are well knowne: and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">hat, not by heare-say (though with that pre|tious ointment, a good-name <HI>Eccles 7.</HI> you are renowned) but cheefely out of my many obser|vations, when I was a Student in the Vniversity, and for a long time, one of your Auditors. Eve|ry way you ratifie and make good this <HI>Encomium SENECTV|TIS.</HI> And therefore yours it is, and to you it comes, both to bee corrected and disposed of, incase it may seeme in any degree, wor|thy your so much paines. And cer|tainely, should I cause my thoughts to range abroad among the Wor|thies that are knowne unto me; none would be found that might
<PB REF="4">
give so ample testimonie to what you shall heere reade, or be so li|ving an example of it, as your selfe. This (I hope) will excuse my presumption, and prevaile with you for your paines in rea|ding the Discourse, though it should not with your judgement for approving it. I beseech the <HI>ANCIENT OF DAIES,</HI> to continue and increase unto you, the good your many yeeres have possessed you of; that as they are found in the way of righteousnes, so they may be to you a crowne of glory, <HI>Prov. 16.</HI> and a crowne of righteousnesse, <HI>2 Tim. 4&punc;</HI></P>

<P>HEre is presented to thee by an Old-Man past his <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Three|score and three.</NOTE> great <HI>climactericall</HI> yeare, a Treatise of OLD AGE, indited and penned by <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">D.

Cic de A|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">icitia in proem.</NOTE> <HI>Being an Old-Man, I wrote to an Old-Man of Old-Age.</HI> As the Author by reason of his much rea|ding, strong memory, profound judge|ment
<PB REF="5">
and long experience was well qualified and enabled to undertake such a taske, so most wisely hath he made choice of a very fit Patron, who notwithstanding his exceeding great Old-Age, and the small characters in which this Treatise was written, read it without spectacles, and with no lesse prespicacie of judgement then of sight, gave his approbation thereof. If therefore DAIES may be heard, and a testimony given by multitude of yeares may gaine credit, there are <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Two or three.</NOTE> as many as the Divine Law exacteth for witnesse bearing that commendeth this Treatise to thee: and those old e|nough; especially the two Elder, who by their many yeares so well im|ployed, as they have imployed theirs, have attained to great experience, and gained much wisdome; so as in them this Adage, <HI>multitude of yeares teach wisdome,</HI> is verified.

within few yeares after the <HI>Author</HI> of this Treatise came to Kings College: yet had this <HI>Author</HI> beene <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Sixteene yeare.</NOTE> more then a Bachelour of Divinities time in the College, before he chose the <HI>Publisher</HI> hereof out of Eton schoole to the said <HI>Kings College.</HI> A favour very great in the kinde, and in the manner of conferring it, most free. <HI>Possumne ingraius &amp; immemor esse?</HI> In all humble and hearty gra|titude is this publicke acknowledge|ment made of a gratious <HI>Tutors</HI> good|nesse, by his much bounden <HI>Pupill.</HI> Gratitude therfore is one inducement, which hath brought me on to lend an helping hand to the publishing of this Treatise, (which is my onely taske.) But an other and greater inducement is the work it selfe: both in regard of the subject matter of it, which is OLD-AGE, and also in regard of the exqui|site manner of handling it, it being per|formed by an <HI>Old-Man,</HI> who hath written hereabout what experience hath verified in himselfe. For hee himselfe is a lively image and repre|sentation
<PB REF="6">
of that true <HI>Old-Man</HI> which<NOTE PLACE="marg">Senectus nos ab im|pudenti si misdomini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> libera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> vo|luptatib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">&punc; gul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> im|po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">it&punc; mo|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">um: libi|dinis fran|git impe|tus: ange<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> sapientia~: dat matu riora con|fili<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">, &amp;c.

If any imagine that OLD-AGE, as it bringeth feeble|nesse upon the body, and upon all the parts thereof, so it blunteth the under|standing, dulleth the wit, weakeneth the memory, and much impaireth all the powers of the soule, I referre him to S. <HI>Hierom,</HI> who in that very place where he granteth the forementioned bodily infirmities and other like to them, to be incident to OLD AGE, sets downe these good things to abide in it and with it: <HI>It keepes us from plea|sures, the most impudent masters: it puts a meane to appetite: it subdueth the vio|lence of lust: it increaseth wisdome: it gives more mature counsell&punc;</HI> &amp;c. And in another place he giveth us a cata|logue of many heathen men, who <HI>be|ing very old, and neere to death, sang their Swan-like songs more sweetly then they were wont in younger yeares.</HI> The Author of this Treatise hath given us a larger catalogue, not only of heathen
<PB REF="6">
men, but also of holy men, Gods wor|thies, who in their OLD-AGE have beene endowed with excellent and eminent abilities, especially of mind: withall he sheweth, that if it so fall out as is objected, it is in such an OLD-AGE as followeth upon distempered <HI>youth,</HI> and disordered manage: but where former yeares have beene tem|perately ordered, and well imployed, OLD AGE&punc; though somewhat debi|litated in bodily strength, will prove vigorous in the indowments of the soule. Of such an Old-Man speaketh an ancient Poet to this purpose,</P>
<LG>
<L>His foot in pace is flow:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. Eurip. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">n.</NOTE></L>
<L>His wit doth swiftly flow.</L>
</LG>
<P>This our Author hath oft most truely and justly observed, that the defects which befall OLD-AGE, are occa|sioned for the most part, if not altoge|ther, by the disorder of younger yeares. Yea the distemper of youn|ger yeares is (to speake according to the course of nature) an especiall cause that so few, even of those who grow bearded, attaine an hoary head:
<PB REF="7">
which (as the Wise-man hath well observed) <HI>is a crowne of glory, if it be</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 16. 31.</NOTE> <HI>found in the way of righteousnesse.</HI> He therefore that wrote much in com|mendation<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic&punc; de Se|nect.</NOTE> of OLD-AGE put in this proviso, <HI>Remember that I praise that</HI> OLD-AGE <HI>which is setled upon the</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Senectus e|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">rum qui a|dolescenti|am suam honest is artibus in|struxer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">nt aetate fit d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ctior, usu tritior, pro|cessu tem|poris sapi|entior, &amp; veterum studiorum dulcissimos fructu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> me|tit.

It is said of a wicked man (<HI>Iob.</HI> 21. 21.) <HI>The number of his daies is</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign"> Divisit vulgat&punc; di|midiavit.</NOTE> <HI>cut off in the midst.</HI> And to like purpose (<HI>Psal.</HI> 55.

In these, and other like re|spects wicked men may be said <HI>dimi|diare dies suos,</HI> to cut off their time in the midst, or not to live halfe their
<PB REF="8">
daies&punc; namely which they might other|wise have lived (according to the course of nature) if they had not fal|len into such exorbitant courses. Thus many keepe themselves from OLD-AGE. Yet it cannot be denied but that sundry wicked ones attaine there|to. Experience demonstrates as much. For howsoever OLD-AGE be pro|mised as a blessing onely to the Righ|teous, yet it is permitted to wicked ones: but as a curse through their a|buse thereof. A curse I say, both to others and to themselves. <HI>To others,</HI> in that the longer they live, the more mischiefe they doe. <HI>To themselves</HI> in this world, and in the world to come. <HI>In this world</HI> every day they multiply and aggravate sinne, and so make them|selves the more odious to God, Angells and good men; whence it commeth to passe that their <HI>name rots:</HI> it is<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pro. 10. 7.</NOTE> like a rotten, pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">rified carrion, the lon|ger it lieth above ground, the more noisome and stinking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">avour it sendeth forth. <HI>In the world to come</HI> their tor|ment shall be increased according to

Thus to take OLD-AGE (seperated from the accidentall im|perfections thereof, such as arise not simply from OLD-AGE, but from the former and present wickednesse of evill old-men) OLD-AGE is one of the pillars wherewith politi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s are supported. Who knowes not that a Senate or Counsell of State is a principall stay of a State. Now a Se|nat useth to consist for the most part of <HI>Old-Men:</HI> who by reason of their

<P>So pithily and plentifully hath the Author of this Treatise here presen|ted to thee, handled this point, both <HI>Vindicatively,</HI> in freeing OLD-AGE<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hier. com|ment. lib. 8. in Isa. 24.</NOTE> from all undue imputations against it, and also <HI>Encomiastically,</HI> by setting out the comelinesse and excellency thereof, as to speake any more there|about, would bee <HI>actum agere,</HI> to preach over the same Sermon againe, yea (as it is in the proverb) to<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.

<P>The consideration hereof caused me to&punc; looke backe to the sundry passages of my life past, and to fixe mine eye on my present condition, being now farre gone in yeares: and in this Meditation, I fell upon a serious thought of my Old-Age: as, what the discomforts of it are, that so I might addresse my selfe to seeke after the true remedy: what good I may find in it for comfort to countervaile the evils it brings: and lastly, what oppor|tunities it may afford me, for my present and future happinesse.

and his so much paines in reading; I would offer to his consideration these three things. First, touching the contempt of this age, how great and common a sin it is. Secondly, what need men in yeares may have, in respect of some bodily defects, of inward comforts, as of a staffe to support them, that so they may passe on to the end of their race with patience. And lastly, whether it will be lost labour, timely to minde young men of the evills, which not prevented, will dogg them to the age, to|wads which they securely passe along; and which is to such (<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Iuven.

<P>Let no man thinke that this Treatise is onely for <HI>OLD-MEN,</HI> chiefely it looks towards them: yet every age, once come to yeeres of discretion, may hap'ly by it be put in minde of some thing or other, that

<HEAD>The Introduction to the whole Discourse.</HEAD>
<P>_AN Old-Man, though but meanely learned, may treat of OLD-AGE, out of some experience, feelingly: and in that respect, may be the more fit to discourse of this subject. Onwhich I do not find that many have lighted: among Divines, very few. Some Heathen<NOTE PLACE="marg">Difference betwixt Theolo|gicall and Philoso|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">hicall Tractates.</NOTE> Writers have professedly handled it: and from one of them I take my aime: yet with this maine difference, that whereas the most lear|ned among them, doe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">scribe all to the gui|dance of nature, and the precepts of Philoso|phy (which, whosoever followes, fares one, shall be sure smoothly to passe thorow all the troubles of this life) the Christian proceeds by a better and safer rule, by that <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> Pet 1. 19.</NOTE> most sure Word of GOD, to which we must take heed, as to a light that shineth in a dark place: to wit, in that darknesse wherein all the Gentiles walked, till <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Esa. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">. 2.</NOTE> the great light shone unto them.

and his Promises in the Gospell, what to be|leeve, if we will rightly judge of this or of any other part of our pilgrimage, and take a sure course for the avoiding of the troubles, and enjoying the comforts of every of them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">How hu|mane te|stimonies to be used</NOTE></P>
<P>I make not the strangers from the covenants of promise, our judges: yet when they come in as witnesses to Divine truth, the authentick testimonies of the Scriptures, I reject them not.</P>
<P>But heere it will be necessary, before we pro|ceed any further, for the stating of the matter in question, to determine what we meane by OLD-AGE: and then also, whether our plea be for the age of Old-men, or for their persons.</P>
<P>Touching the former; In these our daies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Old-age is</NOTE> OLD-AGE is not to bee measured by the yeeres of the most ancient before the flood. We are now in this respect, but as dwarfs to them, or as pigmies: <HI>bipedales,</HI> two foot-high, or, <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Psal. 39. 5, 6.</NOTE> as the Psalmist speakes, our life is but <HI>palmaris,</HI> of a hands-breath in comparison. Which made <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Gen. 44. 9.</NOTE> <HI>Iacob</HI> to confesse and com|plaine that his daies were few, and that he had not attained to the yeeres of the life of his fa|thers, in the daies of their pilgrimages: <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Cap. 14.</NOTE> <HI>Iob</HI> al|so to say, <HI>Man that is borne of a woman, is of few daies.</HI> And it is certaine that we live now scar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e the tenth part of their time. Our life in this old-age of the world, is short, compared with the yeeres of many bruit-beasts, if we may be|leeve <HI>He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">iod,</HI> who makes the Crow to live thrice so long as man, the Hart foure ages of
<PB REF="15">
the Crow, the Raven three of the Hart, the Phenix nine of the Raven. But <HI>Plinie</HI> by whom <HI>He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ods</HI> conceit is reported, and <HI>Aristotle</HI> him|selfe, who allowes no animal a longer life then man, excepting the Elephant, do account this an idle and vaine fiction. <HI>Plinie</HI> writes of one that lived 150. of another which lived ten above that, a third, 200. another 300. and so he goes on to an incredible number of yeares. But in the same place (to make what he had said good and true) he tells us, that a yeere was<NOTE PLACE="marg">Different account of yeares.</NOTE> not the same to them that reported these things, which it is to us&punc; some among them determining one whole yeere by a Summer, and another by a Winter: some by three moneths, as the Arcadians, some by one moneth, as the Aegyptians. But these are uncertaine reckonings. <HI>Hippocrates</HI> makes the extreamestage of man to be 89. <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">In pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">fat. in libr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s de Agric<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">lt.</NOTE> <HI>Varro</HI> saith, <HI>Annus octuage simus admonet me ut sarci|nas c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">lligam, antequam egrediore vita,</HI> my yeere 80 (saith he) calls upon me to trusse up my fardles, and to be ready for my departure.</P>
<P>To leave these also. The Psalmist hath gi|ven us the truest direction, as for our&punc; setting the bounds of a mans life, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">o likewise of OLD-AGE. <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Psal. 90. 10.</NOTE> The time of our life is threescore yeeres and ten ordinarily he meanes, and in a generality, or with most men that come to this age: for in the particulars, the diversity of constitutions doth make a great difference, and further he adds, that if any man live to 80. that age is accompanied with many affli|ctions,
<PB REF="15">
there expressed by labour and sorrow.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Degrees of old-age</NOTE> I am not ignorant, that some Physitians make three parts or degrees of Old-age, one from 50 to 60. another from 60 to 70, and the last and extreamest, from 70 to the decrepit. But I follow the Psalmist, and from that place I gather, that we may reckon him for old, that is come to 60. sith the 70. is made the <HI>terminus</HI> or period of ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s life. <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Seneca Epist. 26.</NOTE> One saith well, <HI>Senecta, lassae, non siactae aetatis nomen est,</HI> the word (<HI>Senecta</HI>) imports a wearied, not a broken age.<NOTE PLACE="marg">What old|men here intended.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now in the next place, to the question, whether men themselves that are in yeeres, or the age, be the subject of our defence: I an|swer, the age, and not alwaies the person, who may be old, and yet not the OLD-MAN wee speake of. There are many that in the former part of their life, have wasted their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">rationall powers, in lewdnesse, or at lest in idle extrava|gant courses These are not OLD-MEN rightly so called: nor (indeed) men at all: but (as <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Tit. 1. 12.</NOTE> th' Apostle termes them) evill beasts and slow bellies, such, <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 5. 6.</NOTE> having lived in pleasures, were dead while they lived: their Sun is gon downe at noone, <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Ier. 15. 9.</NOTE> as the Prophet speakes, their old-age is past, before it comes. They are the same <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Ver. 12.</NOTE> S <HI>Iude</HI> mentions, and calls corrupt trees, twise dead, and plucked up by the roots. Honourable age (<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Wisd. 4. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">, 9.</NOTE> saith the Wiseman) is not that which stands in length of time, nor that is measured by number of yeares: but wisdome is the gray-haire to men, and an answerable life

<PB N="8" REF="17">
in the desart, were from the hand of their gratious and loving God, of whose love and care of them, they had not long before so joyfull expe|rience in their miraculous both deliverance out of Egypt, and preservation at the red Sea: all which (had they not beene more then unthank|full) would have beene fresh in their remem|brance. They should have considered likewise that those afflictions were not punishments so much as fatherly corrections by which they were to be schooled and nurtured; being as yet a re|bellious people, unfit and unworthy to become in|habitants in that happy land of Canaan. Both <HI>Cain</HI> (I say) and that people should have turned<NOTE PLACE="marg">Com|plaints should be against ones&punc; selfe.</NOTE> their complaints and accusations against them|selves.

And also to their inbred corruption and manifold actuall sins they should have had an eye, because they had deserved the afflictions of which they complained, as they are punishments, and did necessarily require them as fatherly chastisements.</P>
<P>And this one consideration might stop the mouthes of those complayners, whether they be such as before they come to this age (having stu|died for some exceptions against it) fall into a base account of it; or Old Men themselves, un|worthily so called, which are ever whining and complaining of their <HI>onus Aetna gravius</HI> (so

<P>Here it will be objected: Is all counsell then lockt up in the breast of the aged? may not

young-men be able to give ad|vice I answer, Yes, but wee speake comparatively, and say onely, that Old-men have better meanes and opportunities for it then the younger, and yet the Philosopher doubts not to aver, that a young-man wanting time and experience, cannot be wise, so wise as I understand it. But further I answer, that my speech tends not to the disabling of any: onely it would free the age I treat of, from disgrace and contempt. Howsoever there is an instance that will extort from us a confes|sion of thus much at the least, that when the counsell of the aged hath beene rejected, and the ad|vice of younger men preferred before it, the successe hath beene very unhappy.

<P>But againe, some man hap'ly will say that the Old-mans weak|nesse and insufficiency seizes not onely on the body, but possesses the mind also. I answer, first <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">In Epist. ad Nepot.</NOTE> with St. <HI>Ierom,</HI> that Old-men instructed in youth in the liberall artes, and exercised in the medi|tation of the law of God day and night, thereby become through their age, more learned; by use, more setled; by succession of time, more wise: and doe reape most sweete fruit by their long continued studies. <HI>Discipulus est prior<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s posterior dies,</HI> saith <HI>Seneca,</HI> the following day ever learnes of the precedent. <HI>Nunquam ita quisquam subduct&acirc; ratione ad vi|tam fuit, quin,</HI> &amp;c. <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Teren. in Pharm.</NOTE> Never (sayes the Comick) was any man so ex|act in resolving of the frame and

course of his life; whom either new occurrences, or age, or ex|perience did not assist with sup|ply, and adde somewhat for the profiting of his judgement, and resolution, minding him of that whereby he perceaved that what he thought he knew, he knew not, and what hee held to be his best way, after triall he rejected as not so good. <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Solon.</NOTE> Another saith of him|selfe, <GAP DESC="foreign">, as I grow in yeares I grow in lear|ning<NOTE PLACE="marg">Defects of Old-age most in the body&punc;</NOTE> and knowledge. Againe I answer, that where the defects and failings of Old-age are fully and elegantly set forth, as <HI>Eccles.</HI> 12. there is mention onely of bo|dily defects: or if of the mindes infirmities also, they are such as proceed from the deficiency of the bodily instruments, which (I confesse) decay by Old-age: so
<PB N="28" REF="27">
as neither the inward nor outward senses can doe their office so well as otherwise they might, but all this is to be imputed to the body, and not to the mind, and the young-man in that place standes charged with it, as with the ef|fects and fruits of his wilde and unbridled carriage. <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Epist. 26.</NOTE> <HI>Seneca</HI> said of himselfe, <HI>non sentio in animo aetatis injuriam,</HI> to my minde my yeares are no prejudice at all.</P>
<P>Come we now to the particu|lar objects of mens indeavours afore mentioned. In the first place wee will consider of pub|lique affaires, and they are either civill in the common-weale, or ecclesiasticall in the body spiri|tuall, or Church of God.</P>
<P>Publique civill affaires may be distinguished by the times of peace and warre. When there
<PB N="29" REF="28">
is peace, questionlesse the gowne<NOTE PLACE="marg">Old-men of best use in peace.</NOTE> (which best fits the Old-mans backe) is preferred before the sword, shield, or helmet, as of greater use for that time. Peace and prosperity, if extraordinarily wise governours be not as a strong bit to hold men in, is the mother and nurse of innumerable vices. <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah</HI> are speciall instances. In peace therefore for the repressing of infinite enormi|ties, the greatest wisedome is re|quired, and where will that be found if not in the aged, in the grave Senate, which hath its de|nomination <HI>a senibus,</HI> from Old|men? The sagest and wisest a|mong the Israelites were stiled, the Elders of the children of Is|raell. The 24. which sate round about the throne, (<HI>Rev.</HI> 4 4.) were Elders, and upon that place

<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Perer.</NOTE> one saith, that whereas gover|ning, instructing, judging, coun|selling are necessary in every so|ciety; Old-men are the fittest for the reverence of their age, ripe|nesse of judgement, gravity of carriage, experience in many things, and not least, for their freedome from perturbations, and quietnesse of their mindes; for the Old-man hath overcome his carnall lusts, and triumphs over them, saith <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">De legat. ad Cam.</NOTE> <HI>Philo,</HI> and so is crow|ned as a conquerour, <HI>Prov.</HI> 16. 31.

therefore that must be admitted, <HI>cedant armatoga.</HI> Now touching<NOTE PLACE="marg">Old-men best Gene|ralls in wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">re.</NOTE> warre, It may be thought that young-men who are full of hot blood, and have quicke and stir|ring spirits, are the onely actors for this employment, and to with|stand the enemy. But neither may this be granted, unlesse we thinke that <HI>Caius Minutius</HI> was a better Generall then <HI>Qu.

Or that he was out, who being asked whom he counted the best leader of his time, said, <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> were he old-enough. Or that <HI>Paulus Ae|milius</HI> knew not what hee said
<PB N="32" REF="29">
and did; who when he had with labour and difficulty (through which his forces grew weary and weake) broken in upon his enemies that were strongly en|camped; and was wished by <HI>Na|sica</HI> presently to set upon them; made answer, that so hap'ly hee should, were he of his age and yeares, a man so young.</P>
<P>What is the number of armed men, be they never so strong and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Old-men fittest cou~|sellers for warre.</NOTE> valorous, when they are not go|verned by wise and stayed Cap|taines? or when the table of counsellors of warre doth not be|fore hand, and after, during the service, upon due consideration of all circumstances of such a bu|sinesse, advise and direct what is to be done? What is it (I say) but as a great flocke of sheepe without a wise and watchfull

Even like to that which befell <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">1 King. 22.</NOTE> King <HI>Ahab</HI> and all Is|raell, when having refused the wise counsell of <HI>Michaia,</HI> hee would needes be swayed by the false advice of the false Prophets, touching his going to <HI>Ramoth Gi|lead?</HI> They were as the Pro|phet had foreseene, and foretold they should be, scattered upon the mountaines, as sheepe that had no shepheard.</P>
<P>Thus in the civill state: how in the Church of God? Heere the Ministers of the Gospell are the worke-men, the men of AC|TION. Touching whom it is to be considered, both what is re|quired of them in their place and function, and also how farre Old|age disables them for it.</P>

Who is sufficient for these things? Not the Old-man, will some say: hee is too weake to beare so great a burden.

<P>The cheefe part of the Mini|steriall<NOTE PLACE="marg">Preaching the chie|fest Mini|steriall function.</NOTE> office (I grant) is prea|ching by voice, by meanes wher|of, more ordinarily faith is wrought, and men brought into Christs sheepe-fold: for faith is by hearing.

It may<NOTE PLACE="marg">The pen goes fur ther then the voice.</NOTE> be truely said, that bookes have winges, and flie abroad into all parts of the world, whereas the sound of the voice reacheth not farre. And it is well observed, that the translating of the old|Testament into greeke by the Septuagint, was a written prea|ching, which prepared the way for Christ among the Gentiles, as the vocall preaching of <HI>Iohn Baptist</HI> (who was <HI>the voice of one</HI>

So, on the contrary, the man that is spirituall, being also heavenly, moves towards heaven, and there|fore the neerer he approaches to that his place (as in Old-age) the stronger will his motion be. An Old-man knowes that he is at the end of the day, for which he is hi|red to worke in Gods vineyard: and therefore the time of his worke being neere upon expiring, he will bestirre him, least death as

be considered, that every age or<NOTE PLACE="marg">Every age hath pro|per im|ployme~ts</NOTE> part of mans life hath, as gifts dif|ferent from the rest, so likewise a different calling and employment, or taske.

<HEAD><HI>The II. Chapter.</HI> Conteining the second supposed disgrace, cast upon OLD-AGE <HI>viz.</HI> Vncapablenesse of pleasures: and the answer.</HEAD>
<P>FOr the full understanding of what shall be said in answer to this imputation; something is to be premised concerning the na|ture, and divers kindes of plea|sure.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="43">First therefore to lay downe a<NOTE PLACE="marg">What pleasure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"></NOTE> generall and breefe description of it: It is defined to be a lifting up of the minde by the presence or hope of some good that is come unto us or may befall us, an ele|vating (I say) of the mind: for as when any evill betides us or is towards us, the minde is dejected and discomforted: so when the contrary, it is contrarily affected. The object of pleasure is some<NOTE PLACE="marg">Good is the object of pleasure</NOTE> good that accrewes unto us: and according to the difference of things tearmed good, must plea|sures be differenced and distin|guished, for either they are falsely, or they are truely so cal|led. Falsely divers wayes. First when they are good in shew one|ly and opinion: and then it is false pleasure that arises from them, not unlike to that which
<PB N="60" REF="43">
was in <HI>Thrasilaus,</HI> who thought all<NOTE PLACE="marg">False plea|sures</NOTE> the ships that arrived at the haven, to be his, and received them with great pleasure and rejoycing: that all (likewise) which set forth were his, which he dismis|sed with a joyfull expectation of a gainefull returne: all the while counting himselfe an happy man that was the owner of so great substance, if any of the ships mis|carried, he enquired not after them: if they returned safe, hee rejoyced. Thus was it with him in his frensy: and when he came to himselfe, he professed that he never lived more sweetely then when he was in that error, for hee had much pleasure (though false) and no care or trouble at all.</P>
<P>Secondly, things may not rightly be called good, when they are not so good, as they are
<PB N="61" REF="44">
esteemed. And they also yeeld a pleasure (at least in part) deceit|full.</P>
<P>Lastly, things may be thought good (and alas, nothing more common) when they are evill, and sinnefull pleasure taken in them must needes be the worst of all.</P>
<P>Now in every of these, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Cit. 2. de finib.</NOTE> it is truely said, and rightly judged to be a vitious rejoycing, when a man thinkes without ground, he hath atteined to that which is good.</P>
<P>Touching the other&punc; kinde of good, which we said is the object of pleasure, to wit, that which is truely and in its nature good, it is of two sorts: the one worldly and corporall, the other heavenly and spirituall: and answerable are the pleasures which come of
<PB N="62" REF="44">
them, either worldly or heaven|ly.</P>
<P>Concerning the worldly;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Worldly pleasures</NOTE> though often, through the abuse of them they become carnall and divelish, yet in themselves they are good and lawfull.</P>
<P>First, because they are as a cor|diall<NOTE PLACE="marg">How worldly pleasures are good</NOTE> that releeves the infirmities of our weake nature: or as an Inne after a long and wearisome journey.</P>
<P>Secondly, they are the bles|sings of God to animate and in|courage us to obedience. <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Psal 104 15.</NOTE> <HI>God hath given man bread to streng|then him, and wine to glad his heart.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, they are approoved of God in Scripture. <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Eccles. 3. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">.</NOTE> <HI>There is a time to laugh and to dance, as well as to weepe and mourne.</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">h. v. 5.</NOTE> And the same Preacher telles us, <HI>that God</HI>
<PB N="63" REF="45">
<HI>answers man in the joy of his heart,</HI> and this rejoycing is (as it were) the condiment of&punc; Gods outward blessings, without which such a blessing will cease to be a blessing. For what were it to have children, riches, honours, and not to rejoyce in them. <HI>Sa|lomon</HI> confirmes this also when he sayes, there is no good in out|ward blessings, but for a man to rejoyce and doe good in his life.</P>
<P>Fourthly, these pleasures are many times both the matter and occasion of praising God. The matter, when a man beholding the things in which he delights, as the aforesaid children, riches, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> doth for them give God praise. Occasion, when we have used these pleasures so, as that thereby we come to the service of
<PB N="64" REF="45">
God with fresher spirits, and more cheerefullnesse.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> But belong these plea|sures<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pleasures are good onely to the faith|full.</NOTE> to all men alike?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> No, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> Tim 1. 4.</NOTE> <HI>To the faithfull a|lone they are sanctified:</HI> onely <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Psal. 32. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">.</NOTE> <HI>The upright in heart can rejoyce,</HI> who can rejoyce when God is angry? <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Isa 57. 21.</NOTE> <HI>There is no peace to the wicked.</HI> As <HI>Iehu</HI> to <HI>Iehoram, how can there be peace so long as, &amp;c.</HI> So, how can there bee true joy, so long as our sinnes stand unre|mitted?</P>
<P>Now, in the next place, it will be needfull that we shew the great difference betweene these two, corporall and spirituall pleasures and rejoycing.</P>
<P>First, the corporall are subject<NOTE PLACE="marg">Differe~ces be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">wixt corporall and spiri|tuall plea|sures.</NOTE> to excesse, whereby they become dangerous and hurtfull to the bo|dy and soule: but the spirituall
<PB N="65" REF="46">
cannot be immoderate: for they<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 In mea|sure.</NOTE> arise from heavenly contemplati|on.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> In pedi|gree. Psal 4. 6.</NOTE></P>
<P>Another difference is, that they have a different pedigree: the one proceeding from Gods speciall favour, the other from worldly things.</P>
<P>A third: when the corpo|rall<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 In satis|faction.</NOTE> nature is satisfied, those plea|sures cease: as when men have a|bated their hunger and thirst, meates and drinkes afford no de|light. Contrary-wise the heavenly joyes and pleasures remaine and continue, the object of them be|ing at all times pleasing and de|lectable: and the subject which is the soule and spirit of a man being alwayes capable of them.</P>
<P>Fourthly, the sensuall pleasures<NOTE PLACE="marg">4 In sea|son.</NOTE> are not at all times in season. There is a time when <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Eccle. 1.</NOTE> to laugh|ter
<PB N="66" REF="46">
wee may say, thou art mad. <HI>As there is a time to laugh, so there is a time to weepe (Ibid)</HI> as name|ly when wee humble our selves before God for our sins, or when any calamity is either threatned, or inflicted. Thats a time to fast and pray and to afflict our soules: then no worldly pleasures may be admitted: they are as poyson to our humiliation. Then, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Psa <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">2&punc; 5.</NOTE> <HI>wee must sow in teares, that after we may reape with joy.</HI> Then, <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 9. ult.</NOTE> <HI>the body must be kept under.</HI> Whence it is that the <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Luk. 16.</NOTE> <HI>Rich mans Epicurisme</HI> became the more odious and the greater sinne, in that <HI>he fared deli|ciously every day,</HI> he made no diffe|rence of times in his pleasures. but the heavenly joyes are not li|mited or excluded by any time. For even in the greatest heavinesse (which is the godly sorrow for
<PB N="67" REF="47">
sinne) the soule of Gods chil|dren partakes of joy and comfort; the Spirit of God, even then, yea and by meanes of that sorrow and repentance, assuring us, and sealing up unto us the forgive|nesse of our sinnes, it being pro|mised to such a turning to the Lord, from which assurance also ariseth peace with God and un|utterable joy and rejoycing in our hearts.</P>
<P>Fiftly, another difference be|tweene<NOTE PLACE="marg">5 In sta|blenesse.</NOTE> them is in regard of the unstablenesse of the one, and the firmenesse of the other. While the comedy lasts, the spectator laughs: but the play and his pleasure end together. Contrariwise the spi|rituall <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Pro. 15. 15.</NOTE> <HI>joy is a continuall feast.</HI> Satan himselfe cannot rob the pos|sessor of it, it is setled upon him by the word of Christ, your
<PB N="68" REF="47">
joy shall not be taken from you.<NOTE PLACE="marg">6 In Puri|ty.</NOTE></P>
<P>Sixtly and lastly, in regard of purity. Worldly pleasures and delights have alwayes some mix|ture of bitternesse, while a man feedes his conceit with aboun|dance of temporall things, his heart is fed upon by three devou|ring vultures: much care in get|ting, more feare in keeping, and most griefe in loosing: and as for greatnesse (so greedily hunted after) it is ordinarily a continu|all vexation; because of envy from inferiours, thwarting of competitors and jealousies of Princes and such like. How ma|ny great mens hearts have burst with the blasting frowne of a Kings fore-head? Nay some|times the disrespect of no very great one, marrs all, which is in|stanced in <HI>Haman.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="48">Thus, by way of preface (o|ver-long<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spirituall pleasures most pro|per to old age.</NOTE> I confesse) I have laid the ground-worke of my answer to the aforenamed imputation, and now I aske whether of these two kindes of pleasures is it, the want whereof they say is a disad|vantage to Old-age. The hea|venly? they will not, they can|not say it. For who may be more replenisht with this joy then the Old-man, in whom the graine of mustard-seed hath had so long time to take roote, and to grow up to a tree that reaches up even to Heaven, the seate of everlasting joy and happinesse? then hee whose daily exercise it is to stand knocking at the gates of Heaven, of his house and home, towards which he hath beene long tra|velling, <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 5. 4.</NOTE> <HI>and for which he hath fetcht many a sigh and grone?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="48">The other kinde therefore of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Want of corporall pleasure is no great disadvan|tage.</NOTE> joy or pleasure it is of which men (belike) are deprived by living long. And of that what shall we now say? If wee aske heathen Philosophers their opinion, they<NOTE PLACE="marg">The vani|ty of cor|porall pleasure</NOTE> will tell us, that it is grosse and brutish: both an inticement to vice and a nourisher of it: that to bring pleasure into the company of vertues, is to set a strumpet a|mongst chast and honest Matrons: that to say it is our cheefe good, is, <HI>vox pecudum, non hominum,</HI> to speake like brute beasts, not like men; that the greater the plea|sure, the more it remooves the minde from its seat and state: that it is a flattering enemie: that with vertue it hath no converse, nothing at all to do: that it makes a man neither better, nor more praise-worthy: that nature hath
<PB N="71" REF="49">
given to man nothing more capi|tall and deadly, a greater plague or enemy: that no high or hea|venly cogitation can consist with it: that he is not to be counted a man, that would spend one whole day in such pleasure: <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Cic 2. de finib.</NOTE> that it more often leaves cause of repen|tance then of remembring it: <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Boet. lib. 3. de conso|lat.</NOTE> that the desire of it is full of anxi|ety and doubtfull feare, but the saciety of it, is repentance: <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Cic de o|ratore.</NOTE> that to it loathing is the nearest neigh|bour. <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Senec&punc; E|pist. 28.</NOTE> What enemies (saies one) can bring upon a man so great reproach and shame, as comes to some men by their own rejoycing?

that they are come to this passe, that the things which before were superfluous and needlesse, are now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">o them made necessary, and so they serve their pleasures, enjoy them not. <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Idem E|pist. 51.</NOTE> In another place hee tells us, that pleasures embrace us to the end they may stifle and strangle us: where also hee gives us an instance in <HI>Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ni|ball,</HI> so hardy and patient, that hee endured the snow, ice and ex|treame coldnesse, and also the dangerous passage on the <HI>Alpes:</HI> but yet the pleasures of <HI>Campania</HI> enervated and overcame him.

of this kinde of joy; the vanity and evill whereof they had lear|ned onely by experience, and the light of nature, but we have be|sides these the Scripture for our warrant; and thence wee are taught, that such as live in plea|sures, are dead while they live, and that <HI>Salomon</HI> hath long time passed his sentence on them, that they are vanity. <HI>Salomon,</HI> who had them in great aboundance, who professes of himselfe, that whatsoever his eyes desired, hee held it not from them, that hee gave himselfe to wine, builded houses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as <HI>Eccle.</HI> 2. and when he had sucked from these delights what possibly they might affoord, in the end he is forced to con|fesse, that they are all <HI>vanity and vexation.</HI></P>

Can we so mistake our selves as not to know either who or where we are? Our owne weakenesse or inability to stand upright? or the ground on which we are while given to pleasures how slippery it is? Our first Parents when they were in their full strength fell from their innocency, in that Garden of de|lights: and shall we then be con|fident and secure in this our weake constitution of body and sinne|full disposition of soule, and think our selves free from the danger of earthly pleasures?

<P>THe next imputation is, that in elder yeares we are weake. For answer, first I see not why the Old-man should bee singled out, as one liable to the greatest disgrace, in respect of the curse and punishment which was laid on all the posterity of <HI>Adam,</HI> without exemption or immunity of any age. But I will addresse my selfe to a more distinct and particular handling of this point.</P>
<P>There are two things inquira|ble in it: one touching infirmity, the other concerning sicknesse.
<PB N="86" REF="56">
Wee will consider of them both, and that comparatively, that it may appeare, which of the sun|dry ages of mans life is least sub|ject to this imputation.</P>
<P>And first of Jnfirmity: which<NOTE PLACE="marg">Infirmity what it is.</NOTE> in my sense is an inclination and aptnesse in such or such an age to any thing that is evill, either in body or mind.</P>
<P>I passe by the <GAP DESC="foreign">, the child in the mothers wombe which suffers there nine moneths impri|sonment, and when at the last (if at the last) it is delivered from that misery; comes foorth with great paine and danger, both to it selfe and the mother. Let us see how it is with it after it is borne and becomes an infant, and so attaines to the first age of mans life. <HI>Naked doth it enter in|to</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Infants in|firmities.</NOTE> <HI>the world</HI> (so <HI>Iob</HI> professes of
<PB N="87" REF="57">
himselfe) whereas other crea|tures (<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">In pro|cem. lib <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">&punc; nat hist.</NOTE> as <HI>Plinie</HI> hath observed) are some of them provided both of armour defensive and offensive: the Bull of hornes, the Lyon and Beare of pawes, the Bore of tusks, the Elephant of a promus|cis, a trunke or snout, and many others, some of defensive one|ly, as Trees have their rine or barke, Fishes, many of them their shels, all, their scales: Beasts their thicke skinnes and haire, Foules their feathers and wings, Sheepe their skins and wool. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> onely the poore infant is borne naked and unarmed: in it selfe utterly destitute of helpe and de|fence.</P>
<P>True it is, that our good God and provident Creator, whose tender eye is continually on this his so weake a creature (his pu|nishments
<PB N="88" REF="57">
being alwayes tempe|red with mercy) hath provided for it in this most feeble estate; which is thankefully acknow|ledged by <HI>David</HI> (<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Psal. 71. 6.</NOTE> <HI>upon thee have I beene staied from the wombe</HI>) yet miserable is the infant consi|dered in himselfe, in respect of this his nakednesse, which is not as that, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2. 25. then our first Parents, when they stood upright before their Creator, were cloa|thed with admirable glory (as <HI>Chrisostome</HI> noteth) such as to which no outward covering could adde any grace, ornament, or helpe; there being then no need: but this I speake of was and is still a punishment of <HI>Adams</HI> sinne and ours: such a punish|ment, as (but that God reaches forth his helping hand and gives meanes in this great weakenesse
<PB N="89" REF="58">
and distresse) would expose the infant to the greatest corporall misery: and as it is, it cannot passe for better then a heavy case, a great infirmity.</P>
<P>Yet besides this, a most pitifull<NOTE PLACE="marg">Infants come into the world crying.</NOTE> cry (ordinarily) accompanies its comming into the world; which tells us that it foresees, or rather forefeeles the innumerable miseries to which it is borne, when it lookes into the vale of teares. And so proper is this cry to its birth, that the Law suppo|ses it dead-borne, or (as the com|mon word is) still-borne, if then it cry not: if it be still at the birth and doe not testifie (by this one and onely voice or meanes it hath, to expresse it selfe and call for life and preservation) how weake it is.</P>
<P>These are the lamentable be|ginnings
<PB N="90" REF="58">
of this miserable life in the Infant. And as it begins, so it continues to the end of this mi|serably-weake age, finding no great alteration or amendment, it is still apt to give notice of its paine and feeblenesse.</P>
<P>But see further, how this weak<NOTE PLACE="marg">Infants how first handled.</NOTE> guest is afterwards entertained in this troublesome tempestuous world. Immediately after the birth, it is taken, and hands are layed on it (as if it had highly trespassed by breach of prison and comming forth of the wombe) and then presently it is bound hand and foot, which is so grievous unto it, that it doth not so much as smile (if wee will beleeve <HI>Plinie</HI>) before the fortieth day.</P>
<P>Of this age therefore we may truly say, that it is weakenesse
<PB N="91" REF="59">
and misery in the abstract.</P>
<P>It is reported of the men of <HI>Thracia,</HI> that when a child was borne, the neighbours sitting round about it, were wont with great lamentation and mourning, to reckon up the many miseries with which it was to enter into this world: and on the contra|ry, when any dyed, to carry the corps foorth with no lesse joy and rejoycing; com|memorating the calamities from which it was delivered. The <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Eccl 7. 2 Infirmity of childe|hood.</NOTE> Preacher also tels us, <HI>that the day of death is better then the day that one is borne.</HI></P>
<P>The next age is Child-hood, which (<NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Reddere qui voces <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> puer &amp; pe de certo sig rat humu~ Hora<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">. de Arte Poet</NOTE> saies the Poet) begins when there is ability to speake and to goe. How fares it with the child during this age? Is it not also weake, so weake and ten|der
<PB N="92" REF="59">
that it requires (for divers yeares) continuall attendance, being as yet but a gristle as it were of no strength; no, nor of wit, to avoid the danger it may fall into? After when it is come to more growth, so infirme is it both in body and mind, that there is no hope of its avoiding infinite mischiefes, have it not the help of others.</P>
<P>Were it not so, what neede<NOTE PLACE="marg">The yoke of childre~</NOTE> would there be of the yoke which children beare under their Go|vernours, Parents, Schoole-mast|ers, Tutors, <HI>&amp;c?</HI> Why else doe they passe thorow infinite affrigh|ting feares, in regard of necessary severity under that government? Were it otherwise, it would bee needlesse and no better then cru|elty, to put them to the grievous paines which they undergoe
<PB N="93" REF="60">
with no small reluctancy: and which are to them almost into|lerable, their weake nature not brooking it. The truth is the scales fall not from the eyes of their mindes; neither can their hearts though tender bee new moulded without much adoe, without their great paines both in doing and suffering: <HI>Multa tulit fecit&abque; puer, sudavit,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>To what end else were restraint<NOTE PLACE="marg">Correctio~ of childre~</NOTE> from childrens desires set upon sports and pleasures? Were they not weake, correction would not bee of so necessary use to them, which <HI>Salomon</HI> saith, <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Prov. 13. 34.</NOTE> <HI>Who so spareth hates his sonne.</HI> Certainely chastisement and good breeding is of greater use to this age then bodily sustenance.

<P>If Child-hood were not an age<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mothers care over children.</NOTE> of great infirmity, the mother that lookes on her sonne with a tender eye, and in the bowells of love and compassion; sighing to remember how lamentably he came into the world, and how dearely she hath bought him: with what care also and paines, she hath nurst him and brought him up to this age; would never dis|pense

<P>Yet in regard of infirmity, I<NOTE PLACE="marg">Youth like a ship.</NOTE> can no better compare it then to a Ship on the Sea, that is fraught with variety of costly wares, but wants a skilfull Pilot to guide it and keep it in safety when stormes arise: whereby often it comes to passe, that it reaches not the ha|ven, but ship, wares and all sinke in the deepe Ocean.

<P>So vaine a thing is bodily<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bodily strength da~gerous</NOTE> strength to youth, that not onely it steades it not, but contrariwise being the breeder of a ground|lesse confidence, it puts it upon infinite dangers: yea, it is the in|strument or meanes by which corrupt nature doth worke its o|verthrow.

<P>That which hath beene said J take to be sufficient to cleare this point, that the young-mans strength and flourishing estate when it is at the highest pitch, or|dinarily makes him no whit the better nor more happy: but much

<P>This <HI>aetas virilis,</HI> is an age (I<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mans age in evill immove|able.</NOTE> confesse) more staid then the former, and lesse hot and violent in affections: but yet more stiffe in every thing: and so whatsoe|ver is evill in it, is more perma|nent and unmooveable, and con|sequently more hurtfull.

easily brought out of frame; yet flexible. Youth, the flower of mans life, is like a tree in the spring-time, beautifull in blos|somes, which gives hope of fruit: and though these blossoms, many times are blasted, and so the tree becomes unfruitfull, yet is it of a more yeelding disposition: and vice being not yet habituall in it or deepely rooted, is more easily nipped in the head.

that he will do it; it is as ab|surd to thinke he is culpable in it, or to accuse him of it.

In the ve|ry same day (<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Super Gen. ad lit.</NOTE> saith St. <HI>Austin</HI>) began <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> to dye, in which they received the law of death.

had the meanes of health and life, and immortality, (to which he was created) laid up for him in those creatures, then all good.

<P>Perfect health man had: but by<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sicknesse by sinne</NOTE> his sinne he lost it.

Would we alwaies live in health? We know not our selves. God that is better acquainted with our estate and condition, sees, that of
<PB N="120" REF="73">
all afflictions, this of sicknesse, is most beneficiall unto us and most necessary. The reasons, to note some of them, may bee these. The first, to make us looke backe<NOTE PLACE="marg">Benefits of sicknes&punc;</NOTE> to see from whence we are fallen, and why. Another, because other afflictions are not so direct pre|monitions of death, which should be the meditation of our whole life. A third, for that this cor|rection doth not onely minde us of our sinnes past, and upbraid us with them, that wee may re|pent, but serves also for a curb or restraint to hold us in from rushing into the world of enormi|ties and sinnes, to which our cor|rupt and unbridled nature other|wise would carry us head-long: for by sicknesse the flesh which rebels against the spirit is weake|ned, and more easily observes that

Fourthly, health of body is an<NOTE PLACE="marg">Health dangerous</NOTE> occasion of many evills, especi|ally when the soule is sicke, or ill affected. <NOTE PLACE="marg">N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> qua~ pej u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> qua~ in sano cor. pore aeger animue ha|bitat.

Hee hates his former disorderly course, and himselfe for it. Hee resolves (though hap'ly with great weakenesse, and sometimes after recovery, inconstancy) yet he resolves, or at least professes a re|solution for amendment: and he binds himselfe to God for it by many promises and vowes: in
<PB N="122" REF="74">

<P>Againe, the want of health may<NOTE PLACE="marg">Health co~ mon to beasts.</NOTE> be borne the more patiently, both by aged and younger folke, be|cause health is a thing common with us to inferiour creatures, not peculiar to man&punc; as <HI>Psal.</HI> 36. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">6. <HI>Lord thou preservest man and beast.</HI> From which place, S. <HI>Austine</HI> observes&punc; that we should not bee proud of health, and we may from the same ground, that there is no cause of our being much dejected, for the want of it.</P>
<P>Well then: were it granted that<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sicknes no disgrace.</NOTE> old-age is followed with more diseases then the other&punc; this not|withstanding would be no dis|grace to it: a benefit rather as hath beene proved. But by the con|current judgement of Physitians, it appeares to be otherwise. For
<PB N="123" REF="75">
they tell us that old-men are not so subject to sicknesse as the youn|ger, and that the reasons of it are these. One, their temperance above others, by which (say they) the most depraved and corrupt nature of man is preserved and held in a healthy constitution. Another, because they are sen|sible of the least causes of sick|nesse, and thereby become wary, and suffer not the diseases to take root in them&punc; And the last is their cold and dry temper, which frees them from hot fevers, in|flammations, and corrupt humors. Whence it is (<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Lib. 7. c. 50.</NOTE> saith <HI>Plime</HI>) that they are lesse subject to the pesti|lence. Hereunto wee may adde the common Proverbe, A Phy|sitian, or a foole.

them. Now we know none hath<NOTE PLACE="marg">Old-age hath ex|perience.</NOTE> so much experience as the Old|man, whose many yeares afford him opportunity and meanes to be to himselfe an Emperike, a kinde of Physitian.

<P>THe last imputation is this;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Propin|quity of death ob|jected a|gainst Old age.</NOTE> that to the OLD-MAN, death is at hand, and knockes at the doore, as it were, ready to come in and ceaze upon him.

Secondly, that were it an af|fliction, as it is deemed to be, the other ages are as liable to it as this. And lastly, that the former part of mans life ill order'd, is one and not the least cause of Old|ages hasting to the grave.</P>
<P>Touching the first. What is<NOTE PLACE="marg">What makes death most grie|vous to good men</NOTE> there in Death that may make it a misery to a good Old-man?

The Cedars which <HI>Hiram</HI> gave to <HI>Sa|lomon</HI> for the building of the Temple, were first cut downe, squared and framed, before they could become that glorious house of God. The same is true of the point in hand. The earthly Ta|bernacle must first be dissolved, as we said before, and then after|wards wee have a building of God. And the seed that is cast into the ground must die, and then be quickned, and have a new body given unto it. The way to

<PB N="141" REF="84">
the messenger and guide which conducts thee to them; namely thy death.</P>
<P>But (will some man say) how can there bee happinesse in that which all men, yea all the other creatures doe shunne? for they all naturally desire to preserve their estate of being what they are, and by all meanes avoid their being dissolved.</P>
<P>I answer, first, Death and disso|lution<NOTE PLACE="marg">How death ab|horred and how desired.</NOTE> is two waies to be conside|red: either simply, as it is an abo|lishing of a present estate, or as it is a passage to a future better con|dition: as it is the former, natural|ly it is abhor'd; but as it tends to perfection, it is both in it selfe desirable, and by the creatures de|sired and longed for before it comes; and when it presents it selfe, right welcome and embra|ced;
<PB N="142" REF="84">
so was it by th' Apostle, <HI>Phil.</HI> 1. 23, he desired to depart, or as some translate it, to be dissolved. Why? not in respect of death it selfe, but because by this death he should passe to a better life; he should live with Christ, hee should bee deliver'd from his claiey house, as that word dissol|ved imports: or dismissed, as <HI>Beza</HI> reads it, and our newest tran|slation; that is, set free from im|prisonment in the body, and from the miseries of this life, and hence it is that the Apostle there pro|fesses that he shall gaine by death, <HI>ver.</HI> 21. he shall gaine Christ by it, enjoy him fully, and with him glory, even the crowne which he aspires unto, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. hence it is also that death is longed for, and earnestly groned after, as 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. neither is this true which hath
<PB N="143" REF="85">
beene said, &punc;onely of the faithfull among men, but of the other crea|tures also; with earnest expecta|tion they grone and travaile in paine for the day of their renova|tion, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 19, 22.</P>
<P>So then, it is plaine that death though it be not simply and in it selfe good and desirable, yet for that which commeth of it, it is.</P>
<P>And this may be further mani|fested by similitudes, with which the same Apostle doth furnish us.</P>
<P>First, in the place afore-named,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death a pulling downe of a Taber|nacle.</NOTE> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 1. the body, our earthly mansion, is compared to a taber|cacle, a weake and moveable house or dwelling: our heavenly habitation to a firme building, <HI>not made with hands, but eternall in the heavens,</HI> and 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15. our
<PB N="144" REF="85">
interred bodies are likened to the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death as the cor|ruption of seed.</NOTE> seed which is cast into the ground, and is there corrupted and dies. I will apply these comparisons to our present purpose.</P>
<P>True indeed, an old weake de|cayed house, is not in this happy, that it is taken downe, better to be in that meane estate in which it was before, then not at all to be, but herein consists the happinesse of its demolishment, that thereby it becomes a new faire building, farre more glorious in it selfe, and more profitable for use then be|fore.</P>
<P>So againe, the seed is not in that happy, that it is corrupted and rotted in the earth, but that <HI>corruptio unius</HI> is <HI>generatio alterius,</HI> the dying of the seed, is the life of the corne that springs from it. <HI>Thou foole,</HI> saith th' Apostle, <HI>that</HI>
<PB N="145" REF="86">
<HI>which thou sowest, is not quickned, except it die.</HI></P>
<P>Thus we see there is still hap|pinesse<NOTE PLACE="marg">The grave as a Gold|smiths forge.</NOTE> in death. The grave may be likened to the Gold-smiths Forge; in it our bodies are refined and polished by Gods Almighty hand, and by the power of Christs Resurrection; and they are made of corruptible incorrupti|ble, and of mortall immortall, and so that comes to passe which we have, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 28. <HI>That all things worke together for good to them that love God:</HI> it is true of afflictions which are the fore-runners of death, and true of death it selfe, and therefore the <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 3. 22.</NOTE> Apostle tells us, <HI>that whether it bee life or death, things present, or things to come,</HI> all are ours: and well saith <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">In Can|tio. Serm. 51.</NOTE> Saint <HI>Bernard, Bona mors, quae vitam non aufert, sed transfert in melius,</HI>
<PB N="146" REF="86">
O happy death that deprives us not of life, but changes this for a farre better. <HI>Dies mortis</HI> (saith <HI>Se|neca) quem tanquam extremum formidas, aeterni natalis est,</HI> How art thou deceived in thy thoughts of death? the day of thy death, which thou so much fearest as thy last day; to thee is the <HI>Birth day</HI> of eternity; and <HI>Euripides</HI> answera|bly, <HI>vivere mori est, mori autem vivere,</HI> to live is to die, and to die is to live. <HI>viz.</HI> eternally.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deaths curse re|moved.</NOTE></P>
<P>But now, another block lies in our way, another Objection, which must also bee answered. How blessed by that (may some man say) which is a curse and pu|nishment for sinne? that which God hath armed against us (as was said before) for the executi|on of that doome, <HI>In the day that thou eatest, thou shalt die the death?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="87">To this I say first, that the Apostle answers it, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15. 54, 55. the most hurtfull creatures, if once they bee disarmed and weakned, cannot hurt us; much lesse when they are overcome and slaine for us, and to our hand, as we say; so is death, Christ hath taken away the sting of it, and conquer'd it, and all adverse power that might stop our pas|sage to Heaven. And as when <HI>Goliah</HI> was overcome by <HI>David,</HI> this victory made all the people of <HI>Israel,</HI> for whom hee fought, Conquerours, and freed them from the power of the enemie: so our <HI>David,</HI> having overcome and conquered death, we are safe, being all more then Conquerours by and in him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Other ages as liable to death as Old-age.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now, the second point fol|lowes, which I proposed for the
<PB N="148" REF="87">
answering of this last accusation (that Old-age is a neere neigh|bour to death:) <HI>viz.</HI> that other ages are as liable to it as this, and many times as neere.</P>
<P>It is observed <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Hugo de Claustro.</NOTE> by one, that there are three messengers of death, casuality, sicknesse, and Old-age.</P>
<P>Casualities and the unhappy<NOTE PLACE="marg">Casualties befall all ages.</NOTE> accidents that doe befall men, and shorten their lives, are indeed many, somewhere whole Cities have beene overthrowne by earthquakes, others burnt up by lightnings: some by fire: whole regions swallowedup by the earths gaping for them, many men and places destroyed by the in|undations of the sea, and many other casualities happen daily; a haire drunke in milke, a stone in a grape, a small bone in a fish, have
<PB N="149" REF="88">
beene meanes of choaking, some have dyed with suddaine joy. Warres, and the Pestilence, how many thousands doe they de|voure? a multitude of such acci|dents there are: but no age is more free from these messengers, then this we speake of, and that for these reasons. First, because this is an age of the best temper and greatest moderation, and circum|spection, whereby divers of those dangers are avoided. Secondly, because it is not so much in bodi|ly action, as the rest. Thirdly, for that it mooves lesse&punc; stirres lesse abroad, giving it selfe to retired|nesse. Fourthly, it is not prest to the warres, where death compas|ses men about, and is daily and hourely expected. Besides, it is free from quarrells, and lesse sub|ject to surfettings, to breaking and
<PB N="150" REF="88">
disjoynting of limbs, or to dead|ly wounds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Touching the second messen|ger<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deseases befall all.</NOTE> of death, Bodily diseases, they are in other ages moe, more sharpe, and more incurable: eve|ry man will grant it.</P>
<P>If it be said, that though these<NOTE PLACE="marg">Every age hath a more certaine period then Old-Age.</NOTE> two messengers should passe by Old-men, yet their age it selfe will stand ready every houre to arrest them. I answer, that neither is that so; for <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Tho. 4&punc;. Sent. di|stinct 43. artic 3.</NOTE> the Schoole|man tells us that OLD-AGE sometimes equals all the other in yeeres and durance, and whereas of the rest there is a certaine set pe|riod and end; of this there is none: for no man knowes when an Old-man shall die, and cease to be an Old-man. <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">In epist. quadam.</NOTE> Saint <HI>Ierome</HI> tells us, that <HI>Nemotam fractis vi|ribus &amp; decrepitae senectutis est, quin</HI>
<PB N="151" REF="89">
<HI>non se putet unum adhuc annum esse victurum,</HI> that there is not any in strength so decayed, and in age so decrepit, as not to thinke he shall live yet one yeere longer.</P>
<P>Further we know that the yon|gest<NOTE PLACE="marg">No cer|tainty of life.</NOTE> hath no lease, no certainty of the number of his daies; and therefore must still be in expecta|tion of death, as well as the aged: for it behooves him that hath no set day for his debt, to be at all times <HI>solvendo,</HI> ready for payment. <HI>Socrates</HI> was wont to say, that to Old-men death stands before them continually in their sight; but to young- men hee lurks be|hind, that unawares he may come upon them, as an enemy that lies<NOTE PLACE="marg">Distemper of former agesmakes Old-Age the nea|rer to death&punc;</NOTE> in ambush.</P>
<P>The third part of my answer remaines: which retorts the fault (if it be one) of Old-ages being
<PB N="152" REF="89">
so neere to death, upon the true cause of it: <HI>viz.</HI> mens intempe|rance, and disorder in the former part of their life. I will briefly passe through the particular fore|going ages.</P>
<P>In Infancy many times the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Causes of infants death.</NOTE> milke in the nursing, or food, when it hath left the brest, is un|holsome: whereby an ill foun|dation is laid for the bodily con|stitution. And heere (by the way) I cannot but blame the indiscreet peremptorinesse of some, who doubt not to make this a generall rule or Maxim, that God never makes the wombe fruitfull, and the brest barren: and thereupon stick not to conclude, that no woman may put forth her childe<NOTE PLACE="marg">In what cases chil|dren may be put out to nurse.</NOTE> to nurse: true, not of nicenesse, and to shunne the paines and trouble of it. Yet it cannot be denied,
<PB N="153" REF="90">
that there are many cases in which the mother not onely may refuse this office (which in it selfe is most naturall, I confesse, and lies neerely upon her) but is a cruell mother to her child (to say nothing of her selfe) if shee doe otherwise: for what weaknesse, and how many deseases may bee derived from a mother (in some cases, I say, and of some constitu|tions) to the child, to its utter over|throw, and undoing? and besides, it is not true that the mothers breasts are never dry: nor that there can be no other thing, that may justly excuse her refusing to be a nurse. But I leave the digression, having but occasionally and by the way fallen upon it. And now further I say, that often through want of attendance the poore infant falls into many mischiefes; all which
<PB N="154" REF="90">
it carries with it to Old-age, if the grave prevent it not.</P>
<P>Child-hood is subject to as great distempers and hurts.</P>
<P>The Young-man is next, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Causes of death in child|hood.</NOTE> his affections for the most part, are strong and violent (as hath beene shewed) whatsoever comes of him, he resolves to please his ap|petite in diet, to satisfie his desire of pleasures in immoderate re|creations, and to nourish the pride of his bodily strength and active|nesse in violent exercises, and his lusts also in wantonnesse, and then no marvaile if an intemperate youth leaves to OLD-AGE a weake and worne-out body.</P>
<P>Of mature, or the ripe age,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Causes of death in man-age.</NOTE> what shall we say? that (a man would thinke) will be wary of doing wrong to so good, so neere a neighbour as OLD-AGE is to
<PB N="155" REF="91">
it. Yet we know, and cannot but observe so much, that the two vi|ces before noted do adhere to it; covetousnesse and ambition put men upon many labours, toyles and attempts, which hotly and eagerly pursued, according to the extent of their desires; cause sur|fetings and bring many infirmi|ties<NOTE PLACE="marg">Evill of former ages fol|low Old-Age</NOTE> and diseases upon it: which tend directly to death.</P>
<P>Now all these evills in the end, fall to the lot of the Old-man, brought upon him (as we see) by the foregoing part of his life; and therefore to it they must be impu|ted, and it may truly be said, that if Old-men bee neere to death, they are thrust upon it by their predecessours, the former ages. <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Ita <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">st, non acce|pimus bre vem vita~, sed seci|mus: non exiguum tempus ha|bemus, sed mulium perdimus&punc; necinoses ejus sed prodigi su|mus.

<P>And that the sicknesses of elder yeeres (the causes of deaths approach) bee they moe, or be they fewer; are to be imputed to former errors &amp; disorders in diet; we may have some proofe from those two famous Physitians, <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> and <HI>Galen:</HI> of whom the former lived to an hunder'd, the other to an hunder'd and foure: and how, but through their knowledge and care, by which they attained to a rare temperance in the former part of their life. <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Ioseph. de bello Iu|d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ico. lib. 2 cap. 7.</NOTE> The <HI>Essaei</HI> also (a Sect among the Jewes) were very temperate and sparing in their diet; and by meanes thereof lived ordinarily to an hun|der'd.</P>

So tender|ly is the eye of Gods providence cast on the Old-Man, that hee takes order for his being plenti|fully furnished with all necessa|ries, before he brings him to this infirme bodily estate.

<P>But soft, will some man say: let not the Old-man vaunt too much of the good hee receives from the times past and gone: they store up evill to him as well as

good: they daily set him on the score, and he must pay all when the reckoning comes in. A disor|derly impenitent fore-led life brings heapes of wrath upon him, and the heavie burden of sin, then when he is least able to beare it: to say nothing of other distresses in his temporall estate. I answer: It is<NOTE PLACE="marg">Discom|forts are no dis|parage|ments to Old-Age.</NOTE> true, too true. The person of the Old-man oft-times feeles the smart of those discomforts: but it is no disparagement to the age that incurres no blame by it, and it is the age so much disregar|ded, that is heere pleaded for. Now when wee see innocency suffer, how will it affect us? with contempt, or commiseration? surely if OLD-AGE be in any man so happy (in some by Gods gracious working it is) as to make a Comedy of that which

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Touching <HI>OLD-AGES</HI> second priviledge, <HI>viz.</HI> meanes for a greater measure of grace.</HEAD>
<P>THis my claime for OLD-AGE, maintaines not an uncapablenesse of it, either in In|fancy, when God is pleased gra|tiously to worke it, or in child|hood, or the other two ages; but
<PB N="169" REF="98">
this, That many yeares and long<NOTE PLACE="marg">Old-Age an helpe to grace.</NOTE> life is no small help this way; and that in divers respects: First, in regard of the time it gives for it. Secondly, in respect of the nature of grace, which is to grow: the more certainely, the more time it hath. Thirdly, because God the best and richest, the bountifullest master doth give the greatest re|ward to them that have served him longest.</P>
<P>Concerning the first. Time and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fit time and place must bee for every thing.</NOTE> place fit and convenient must be granted to every thing. As it was said by the grand Enginer <HI>Archimedes, Da ubi consistam &amp; movebo terram:</HI> set mee in a fit place, and I will move the earth: so saith the skilfull and industri|ous man, give me time, and I will worke wonders. Time it is, by which being and increase is given
<PB N="170" REF="98">
to every creature. Six daies God tooke for the Creating of the world, and all things in it; that short time hee allotted to that worke: and the rest of time he hath appointed for his providence in governing whatsoever he hath made: for his preserving, ordering, and blessing with growth and in|crease every creature, and each good thing hee hath bestowed on it. From hence it will follow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Old-Age hath best meanes for grace.</NOTE> that the men to whom God hath granted a long time and many yeeres, have by it the better meanes and helps for adding still more and more to the grace they have received. As, to insist in some particulars: they may at|taine to more knowledge then others, and a riper judgement, <HI>Heb.</HI> 5. the Apostle compares the Word of God to food: and the
<PB N="171" REF="99">
hearers &amp; learners of it he distin|guishes according to the severall kinds of food. The Word hath milk, the first principles &amp; easiest parts of it; and that is for children and babes in Christ. It hath also stronger meate, points of do|ctrine more hard to bee under|stood: this is for men of riper age in Christianity, such as through custome, have their wits exercised to discerne betweene good and evill, as in that place, <HI>ver.</HI> 12. the difference there is in the time: <HI>Concerning the time</HI> (saith the Apostle) <HI>yee ought to be teachers,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The light in the dawning of the day is not so cleere, as when the Sun is risen above our <HI>Hori|zon:</HI> so neither is the new-borne babe so inlightned in his ten|der yeares, as when time hath

<P>As it is in knowledge, so in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Old. Age hath ex|perience.</NOTE> faith. For the experience a Chri|stian hath (by long continuance in this estate) of Gods mercifull dealing with him in things tem|porall and spirituall, gives strength to his assurance: as it did to <HI>David</HI> after his triall of Gods assistance in his overcom|ming and slaying the Lyon and the Beare. In repentance like|wise: for by the daily renewing of it, throughout a mans life, it is still more and more perfected: and so in the rest.</P>

<P>The mysteries of salvation in<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Old-Age of the world had grea|test myste|ries.</NOTE> the Old Testament, were indeed mysteries, being delivered in Types and figures unto the peo|ple <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Gal. 4.</NOTE> which were but as infants and children: but in the New Testament, and the last times (the
<PB N="174" REF="100">

<P>The Apostles of our Saviour, in<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Apo|stles most excellent in their el|der yeares.</NOTE> their minority, there beginnings, how weak were they? for their little faith they were often checked by their Master: and when they had beene for a good space in Christs Schoole, they were notwithstan|ding but novices in their con|ceiving of some very necessary points: as of his death, of his Resurrection and of the vocation of the Gentiles, and how little had they then profited in that pa|tience and constancy, which should have beene in them? in suffering, how weake was <HI>Peter,</HI> when he denied his Master in that fearefull manner? and all the Apostles at Christs death, when they forsooke him? yet after|wards
<PB N="175" REF="101">
in their elder yeares, they were the trumpets of the Gospell in preaching: Martyrs in suffe|ring: and with knowledge, faith, constancy, zeale, and all manner of gifts miraculously furnished. It is true: This was not to be as|cribed chiefly to time (as nei|ther the other encrease afore mentioned) but to the mighty working of the Spirit in them yet this, that increase of age, or time, gave opportunity for it, cannot be denied.</P>
<P>What thinke wee of the Pa|triarks<NOTE PLACE="marg">The old Patriarks advantage</NOTE> before the flood; their many yeeres, their living (some of them) to almost a 1000, was it not a great advantage to them, for the repairing of the Image of God, so much defaced not long<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grace by growth gets strength.</NOTE> before?</P>
<P>The next Reason to prove that
<PB N="176" REF="101">
many yeeres give great helpe to increase of grace; is from the na|ture of it. It is naturally apt, yea mighty and powerfull in growth. Whence it followes, that the lon|ger it continues in any, the more it may grow and increase: and OLD-AGE affoords time for it. As the Word of God, from which it arises and springs, <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 1.</NOTE> is <HI>immortall seed,</HI> and the sower, or Seeds-man, God himselfe, the most skilfull and Almighty Hus|band-man, who with the same hand, <HI>plants, waters, and gives the increase:</HI> so the grace and fruit it selfe, is in such manner blessed by the worker of it, as that it hath power to grow abundantly.</P>
<P>In the first of <HI>Geneses, ver.</HI> 28. It is said, that God blessed his creatures by giving them power to bring forth fruit, and multiply,
<PB N="177" REF="102">
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now as the blessing upon those reasonlesse creatures was for increase, and conveyed to them a power for the same, which wee call the Law of nature: so the other blessing upon man, gives power likewise, not onely for naturall propagation, but also for spirituall growth; which we may call the Law of grace, be|cause God by the gracious wor|king of his Spirit, confers on it this power of increasing. Now, as time is required for it, so the more time (which is a priviledge of OLD-AGE) the more opportu|nity and meanes. <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 13 11.</NOTE> <HI>When I was a child</HI> (saith the Apostle) <HI>I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I be|came a man, I put away childish|nesse.</HI></P>
<P>The seeds of grace, when they
<PB N="178" REF="102">
are first sowne, are the least of all seeds: yet growth (by time) makes them the greatest: our Sa|viour instances for it, <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Mat. 13. 31.</NOTE> <HI>in the graine of mustard-seed.</HI></P>
<P>So you have the second Rea|son<NOTE PLACE="marg">Old ser|vants re|spected by God.</NOTE> to proove, that by multitude of yeares grace is multiplied. The third and last, is taken from Gods speciall love and respect to an old servant, (a point before touched) and his bounty in rewarding him above others. Every good ma|ster doth so: and God is the best Lord that any creature can serve. He rewards, not onely at the end of the day, when all our worke is done, with a crowne of righteous|nesse; but, the meane while, in the Kingdome of Grace likewise while we are in working, and even by meanes of our work, and for it (as our reward) with a greater
<PB N="179" REF="103">
measure of grace, even heere in this life. Such a servant shall dou|ble his talents, and thereupon bee made <HI>ruler over much, and enter into his Masters joy.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Prooving that <HI>OLD-AGE</HI> is ho|nourable.</HEAD>
<P>VVe have seene the Old-Mans second priviledge: the third is Honour.</P>
<P>Honour, on whom soever it is<NOTE PLACE="marg">Old-Age honoura|ble.</NOTE> rightly confer'd, is a great gift. <HI>A good name</HI> <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Eccl. 7. 3</NOTE> <HI>is better then a pre|tious oyntment,</HI> <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Pro. 22. 1</NOTE> <HI>To be chosen above great riches;</HI> but that onely is true honour, which is given by God himselfe primarily, and by men
<PB N="180" REF="103">
his sub|dispensers of it, accor|ding to his rule and direction, <HI>Laus a laudato,</HI> hee is rightly prais'd, that is prais'd by the worthiest of praise. Man, judging of anothers worth, may and of|ten doth erre, his <HI>judicium,</HI> many times, is <HI>prejudicium,</HI> he judges with prejudice; not uprightly, but with partiality, with a squint eye, and upon sinister respects. But God is the true and just Judge, and the onely giver of Ho|nour, and God fastens it on the gray-haires in the fift Comman|dement.</P>
<P>But heere hap'ly some man will say, <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Prov. 16. 31.</NOTE> <HI>The heary head is indeed a crowne of glory,</HI> but how? <HI>be|ing found in the way of righteous|nesse,</HI> otherwise not: and so Ho|nour is not the Old-Mans privi|ledge, but vertues shadow the
<PB N="181" REF="104">
reward of righteousnesse in whomsoever. I answer&punc; Ho|nour belongs to the very age of an Old-Man: for it is certaine, and will not be denied, that men in yeeres, even for their yeeres, are to be ranked among the Fathers meant in the fift Commande|ment. Now to all Fathers is Ho|nour there allotted, asto Fathers; and therfore even for this to Old|men. The Magistrate in the Common-weale, the Minister in the Church, the Father and Ma|ster in a Family have right to it, as they are Fathers. May the subject, or the flock and people, or the child and servant withhold this Honour, in case the forena|med superiours doe faile of what is required of them? no man may, no man will say it. The meaning of the place therefore,
<PB N="182" REF="104">
I conceive to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">, That when the Old-man is not old one|ly, but also vertuous, then his honour is much the greater, even a crowne of glory, as is also the Magistrates, the Ministers, the Fathers and the Masters. In the 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5. 17. it is said, <HI>That the Elders which rule well, are worthy of double honour,</HI> of honour (doubt|lesse no man will gaine-say it) as they are Elders and Rulers; but when they rule well, the honour must be doubled upon them. So in that place of the <HI>Proverbs;</HI> it is plaine therefore, that honour is due to Old-men, even for their yeeres, which is a priviledge not granted to any of the other ages.</P>
