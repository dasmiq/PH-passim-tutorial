my time and your

Honors knowledge
of me, short: Your
desire many times to
heare others writing
out of my mouth,
made mee to put this
of my owne into
your hands; a rapso|die
of resolves and

for contemplation, o|thers
for caution, the
first divine, the other

lose an houre from
better and graver

on these; wher|in
you have some|what
of God, of o|thers,
of our selves,
what God is to us,
what we should bee
to him, to others: there
cannot be much said
of it, because there is
but little said in it; in
all which little I in|tend
nothing to my
selfe, but to others.
The generall end of
reading is to know,

reading is to good
our knowledge, and
if it doe good, I have
my end, and my re|ward,

<P>_MAke <HI>God</HI> the

<P><PB N="2" REF="5">
That we brought no|thing
into this world, is
not more every where
<HI>knowne,</HI> than it is of e|very
one beleeved; but
that wee shall carry no|thing
out of this world,
is a sentence better
<HI>knowne</HI> than <HI>trusted,</HI> o|therwise
I thinke men
would take more care
to live <HI>well,</HI> than to dye
<HI>rich.</HI></P>
<P>Wealth is not the
way to heaven, but the
contrary; all my care
shall bee how to <HI>live well,</HI>
and I am sure I shall ne|ver
<HI>dye poore.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="5">
Sleepe is but deaths el|der
brother, and death is
but a sleepe nicknam'd;
why should I more
feare to goe to my <HI>grave</HI>
than to my <HI>bed,</HI> since
both tend to my rest:
when I lye downe to
sleepe, I will thinke it
my last, and when I rise
againe, account my life
not continued but re|stor'd.</P>
<P>Too much <HI>labour</HI>
toyles the body, too
much <HI>looking</HI> the minde:
I will deale for my <HI>study</HI>
as for my <HI>stomacke,</HI> e|ver
<PB N="4" REF="6">
rise with an appetite, lest
if I once surfet, I ever
loath it.</P>
<P>How hard it is for a
man to forget his sinne,
or remember his God,
not to doe that evill
which he should not, and
not to leave undone that
good which hee should
doe, every man can tell
by experience. I were
no man, if I had no sinne,
but if I am a Christian
I must not delight in sin;
if I cannot <HI>avoyd</HI> some
sinnes, yet I will <HI>stand</HI>
in none.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="6">
To doe any thing to
thinke to be talk'd of, is
the vainest thing in the
world; to give almes
and aske who sees, lo|seth
the prayse and the
reward: I may be seen to
give, I will not give to be
<HI>seene,</HI> that others are wit|nesse
to my piety is not
my fault, nor my praise;
I will never bee so ill a
friend to my selfe to sell
heaven for vaine-glorie.</P>
<P>The obedience of good
children proceeds not
from feare, but love; it is
a very bad nature will
doe nothing without
<PB N="6" REF="7">
blowes; to turne to
our vomit as soone as
God is turn'd from his
rod, and aske who is the
Lord till a new plague,
is a state I know not
whether more to be fea|red
or pittied: if I can|not
avoyd correction, I
will mend with it; not
bee beaten twice for the
same fault.</P>
<P>I know not which is
worse; the <HI>bearer</HI> of tales
or the <HI>receiver,</HI> for the
one makes the other: I
will no lesse hate to <HI>tell</HI>
then to heare slaunders:
If I cannot stop others
<PB N="7" REF="7">
mouthes, I will stop my
owne eares. The receiver
is as bad as the thiefe.</P>
<P>With God a Publi|can
goes beyond a Pha|risie,
a sigh or a groane,
that cannot bee uttered,
beyond a long prayer
with ostentation: Care
not how long, or how
<HI>lowd</HI> thy prayer be, but
how <HI>hearty.</HI></P>
<P>Woman was first gi|ven
to man for a helpe,
since for a remedy, what
shall we thinke of those,
that turne the remedy in|to
a disease, and hold it
in all cases for some, and
<PB N="8" REF="8">
in some cases for all, not
onely dangerous but
damnable to marry;
what is this but to teach
God what Hee hath to
doe? I have ever counted
it safe and wise to leave
that indifferent which
God hath left so.</P>
<P>GOD cannot endure
a Pharisee that saies and
doth not: with His disci|ples,
saying and doing
must not bee two mens
offices; if thou canst doe
but little, promise the
lesse; so though thou
maist bee thought nig|gardly,
because thou per|formest
<PB N="9" REF="8">
so little, yet thou
shalt be knowne just be|cause
thou promised'st no
more.</P>
<P>A good man would
so be <HI>honourable,</HI> as hee
may still bee <HI>honest,</HI> not
broker for preferment;
if not worthy, let him
want it, but if deserving,
why should he buy his
due? I will neither grow
<HI>great</HI> by buying honour,
nor <HI>rich</HI> by selling it.</P>
<P>In injuries it is better
to take many, than give
one, in benefits the con|trary:
I will requite the
<PB N="10" REF="9">
first with bearing them,
the second with <HI>requiting</HI>
them.</P>
<P>Evill communication
corrupts good manners.
<HI>Peter</HI> denied his master
among the Iewes, whom
he confessed among the
Apostles: I may have a
bad man of my familie,
I will never have a bad
familiar; or if at any
time of my <HI>court,</HI> never of
my <HI>counsell.</HI></P>
<P>So live with men as
considering alwaies that
God sees thee, so pray
to God, as if every man
<PB N="11" REF="9">
heard thee; doe nothing
which thou wouldest not
have God see done; de|sire
nothing which may
either wrong thy profes|sion
to <HI>aske,</HI> or Gods ho|nour
to <HI>graunt.</HI></P>
<P>Every night is an Em|bleme
of death, in this,
that in both we rest from
our labours: I will la|bour
to long for my rest
in heaven, and I shall ne|ver
be loth to goe to bed
to the earth, who would
not desire to dye that he
might be with Christ?</P>
<P>It is good in prospe|rity,
<PB N="12" REF="10" MS="y">
to make roome for
adversity, that however
it come <HI>unsent</HI> for, it
may not come <HI>unlook'd</HI>
for; if it doe not come,
wee are never the worse,
if it doe come we are the
better provided; expe|ctation,
if it doe not hin|der
crosses, yet it lessens
them.</P>
<P>Earthly things are like
dreames, awake to no|thing;
like shadowes set
with the sun, wealth and
honour will either leave
us, or we them. I will
labour onely for those
pleasures which never
<PB N="13" REF="10" MS="y">
shall have an end, and be
more delighted that I
shall be happy, than that
I <HI>am</HI> so.</P>
<P>'Tis a good Signe,
when GOD chides us,
that He loves us, nothing
more <HI>proves</HI> us His than
blowes, nothing sooner
<HI>makes</HI> us His: God can
love His children well,
and not make wantons
of them; if I suffer, it is
that I may raigne. How
profitable is that afflicti|on,
that carries me to hea|ven?</P>
<P>Suffering is the way
<PB N="14" REF="11">
to glory, sometime in
this World: <HI>Ioseph</HI> had
never beene a Courtier,
had hee not first beene a
prisoner.</P>
<P>Gods children are e|ver
the better for being
miserable, and end in
that; It is good for mee,
that I have been afflicted;
let God use me how Hee
will on <HI>earth,</HI> so I may
have what Hee hath pro|mised
to those that love
Him in <HI>heaven;</HI> Who
would not be a <HI>Lazarus</HI>
for a day, that hee might
sit in <HI>Abraham</HI>'s <HI>bosome</HI>
for ever?</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="11">
Gods Church must
be a lillie among thorns,
and while I am a member
of the Church, I must
not looke to fare better
than the whole Body, if
they have call'd the ma|ster
of the house Beelze|bub,
well may it be en|dur'd
to those of the
household; my comfort
is if I am reviled for His
sake, I shall be blessed.</P>
<P>Prosperity is like <HI>Vi|num
merum,</HI> all wine; it
makes drunke the soule,
and therefore God min|gles
<PB N="16" REF="12">
it, that He may keep
us sober; feeds His chil|dren
with a bit and a
knocke, ever dishes His
sweete meate with sowre
sause: if wee <HI>did alwaies
abound</HI> wee would grow
proud, and forget our
selves; and if not <HI>some|times,</HI>
wee would despaire
and forget our God: I
will pray with <HI>Salomon,</HI>
give me neither wealth
nor poverty, but a meane;
or if wealth, grace to im|ploy
it, if poverty, pati|ence
to endure it.</P>
<P>Afflictions are the
medicines of the minde,
<PB N="17" REF="12">
if they are not tooth|some,
let it suffice, they
are wholesome; 'tis not
required in Physicke
that it should please, but
heale, unlesse we esteeme
our pleasure above our
health: let me suffer, so I
may reigne, be beaten, so
I may be a son. Nothing
can be ever too much to
endure for those pleasures
which endure for ever.</P>
<P>There was never good
but was hard to get: the
prison and the hatchet,
sores and crums leade to
<HI>Abraham's</HI> bosome, and
the way thither is by
<PB N="18" REF="13">
weeping-crosse: if many
tribulations will carry
me to heaven, on Gods
name let me have them;
welcome the poverty,
which makes me heire
to those riches that never
shall have an end.</P>
<P>I will deale for my
soule, as for my body,
never refuse health be|cause
the Phisicke that
should procure it, is bit|ter;
let it distast me, so it
heale me.</P>
<P>There are in the
world that thinke it too
great sawcinesse to be our
owne spokes-men to God
<PB N="19" REF="13">
and therefore goe to S^t.
Some-body to preferre
their petitions for them:
I shall ever hold it good
manners to goe of my
owne errants to God, He
that bids me Come, will
bid me welcome; God
hath said, Come unto me
&amp;c. It is no unmanner|linesse
to come when I
am call'd.</P>
<P>All <HI>consciences</HI> like
all <HI>stomacks</HI> are not a|like
how many doe we
see digest those sinnes
with ease, which others
cannot get downe with
struggling, one straines
<PB N="20" REF="14">
at a gnat, when another
swallowes a camell: hee
that will keepe cleere of
great sinnes, must make
conscience of all. I will
thinke no sinne little, be|cause
the least endangers
my soule, and it is all one
whether I sell my SA|VIOVR
for thirty pence,
with <HI>Iudas,</HI> or for halfe
I am worth, with <HI>Anani|as;</HI>
whether I goe to hell
for one sin, or for many.</P>
<P>This life is but a journey
unto death, and every day
we are some spannes nee|rer
the grave; how is it
that wee which are so
<PB N="21" REF="14">
neere our death, are so
farre from thinking of it?
Security is a great enemy
to prevention, and a pre|sumption
that wee shall
not dye <HI>yet,</HI> makes men
that they doe not prepare
to dye <HI>at all:</HI> it is good
taking time while time
is; if it come suddenly
and find thee unprepared,
miserable man that thou
art, who shall deliver
thee from the body, &amp;c?</P>
<P>Therefore hath Nature
given us two eares and
but one mouth, that we
should heare twice as
much as wee should
<PB N="22" REF="15">
speake: with all thy se|crets
trust neither thy
<HI>wife</HI> nor thy <HI>friend,</HI> hee
that is thriftie of his owne
tongue shall lesse feare a|nothers.</P>
<P>There are that affect
not so much to have true
friends as to have <HI>many,</HI>
and whisper to that
friend what they heare
from this, and againe,
to this, what from that:
and glory to have it
knowne, how much
they are trusted, where|as
they were therefore
trusted that it might not
be knowne: I have ever
<PB N="23" REF="15">
thought it a maxime in
friendship, that he which
will bee intimate with
<HI>many,</HI> is entirely <HI>nones;</HI>
let me love and be lov'd
of all, I will bee inward
onely with a few: I had
rather have one meane
friend that I may call my
<HI>owne,</HI> than the most po|tent
where I must share
with <HI>others.</HI></P>
<P>He that provides not
for his owne is worse
than an infidell; 'tis not
the blame of charity that
it begins at <HI>home,</HI> it is
that it ends not <HI>abroad:</HI>
I am not borne all to my
<PB N="24" REF="16">
selfe, somewhat to my
friend, to my neighbour.
I will so care for my
<HI>owne,</HI> as I may relieve
<HI>others,</HI> and so doe for <HI>o|thers,</HI>
as I wrong not my
<HI>owne.</HI></P>
<P>Much <HI>knowledge</HI> not
much <HI>speech,</HI> Emblem's
a wise man. I shall ever
hold it neither safe nor
wise, alwaies to speake
what I <HI>know</HI> of my
owne affaires, nor what
I <HI>thinke</HI> of others; a man
may speake too much
truth.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="16">
Pleasures like the Rose
are sweet but prickly,
the hony doth not coun|tervaile
the sting, all this
worlds delights are va|nity,
and end in vexation;
like <HI>Iudas</HI> while they
kisse, they betray. I
would neither be a <HI>Stoick</HI>
nor an Epicure, allow
of no pleasure, nor give
way to all: they are
good sause, but naught
to make a meale of, and
were given not to fill
the belly, but to relish
the meate: I may use
them sometimes for di|gestion,
never for food.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="17">
In crosses these two
things must be thought
on; first <HI>whence</HI> they
come, from God, Hee
strikes thee that made
thee, next <HI>wherefore</HI> they
come, for thy good
either to try thee or to
mend thee, if they bee
harsh, yet they be gain|full:
I shall ever count it a
good change, to have
the <HI>fire</HI> of persecution
for the <HI>fire</HI> of hell, who
would not rather smart
for a while then for ever:
let me rather have that
<HI>fire</HI> which is rewarded
with heaven, than these
<HI>pleasures</HI> which shall be
<PB N="27" REF="17">
rewarded with <HI>fire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Salomon</HI>'s, Rejoyce oh
young man in the dayes
of thy youth, were the
finest thing in the world
if it were not for that
which follows, for all
this thou shall come to
judgement; to goe well,
lye soft, sleepe hard, if
there were noe after-reckoning;
who would
not say out of delight
what the Apostles did
out of amazement, It is
<HI>good for us to be here;</HI>
but when I have a
stewardship to account
for, and God knowes
<PB N="28" REF="18">
how soone, my master
returning and my talent
to seek; the Bridegroome
entering and my oyle to
buy, I have more reason
to care how to <HI>redeeme</HI>
my time past, than to
<HI>spend</HI> the present.</P>
<P>To grow heavy or
lumpish with crosses, ar|gues
not so much want of
courage, as grace: no|thing
more soyles the re|putation
of a Christian,
than to have his minde
droope with his Mam|mon;
what if health,
friends, meanes, have all
forsooke thee, wilt thou
<PB N="29" REF="18">
lose thy wittes together
with thy goods? all the
afflictions in this world,
cannot answer the joyes
of that other. I will ne|ver
care whose these plea|sures
<HI>I see</HI> be, while those
<HI>I doe not see</HI> are mine, and
the fountaine of plea|sures
whom I shall one
day <HI>see,</HI> as I am <HI>seene,</HI> shall
be mine.</P>
<P>Let another praise
thee and not thine owne
mouth; either we are far
from neighbours or ill
beloved among them,
when wee are faine to be
our owne trumpet, and
<PB N="30" REF="19">
blaze our selves: the <HI>Iews,</HI>
not the <HI>Centurion,</HI> say, He
loved our Nation and
hath, &amp;c. It is both hono|rable
and humble to heare
of our praises, and tell of
our unworthinesse.</P>
<P>Many a little make a
mickle, every day a mite
will encrease our store; I
wil be ever adding to my
heape of knowledge, of
faith, &amp;c. That when the
Master returnes I may be
able to say, behold <HI>Lord,</HI>
thy two Talents have gai|ned
other two.</P>
<P>The building of the
soule, like that of the
<PB N="31" REF="19">
world, is not done in a
day; grace like <HI>Ezekiel's</HI>
waters, is first to the
ancles, then to the knees,
&amp;c. In vaine doth any
thinke to bee perfect at
once, in an instant; well
is it for us, if after ma|ny
Lessons learn'd, and
heard in CHRIST'S
Schoole, wee get past
the spoone, and with
some yeares of teares and
prayers come to a sta|ture,
a growth; and with
clambering and paines,
like <HI>Zacheus,</HI> get to see
<HI>Christ</HI> time was when it
was said to the Apostles,
<HI>Oh yee of little faith;</HI> and
<PB N="32" REF="20">
hee was once afraid to
confesse CHRIST, that
was not afterward afraid
to die for him: like Bees,
while we are here, we are
ever gathering, in His
good time wee shall bee
perfect, in the meane time
LORD suffer us not to
bee tempted above that
we are able.</P>
<P><HI>God</HI> is that to the soule
which the Sunne is to the
world, <HI>light</HI> and <HI>heat,</HI> and
with them comforts and
stores it: he that hath <HI>God</HI>
hath every thing; <HI>God</HI> a|lone
is a world of friends
against millions of ene|mies:
<PB N="33" REF="20">
then will I thinke
my selfe poore, misera|ble,
distressed, <HI>left,</HI> when
He <HI>leaves</HI> me.</P>
<P>Every thing almost we
see, borrowes its nature
from its soile; thus the
body and temper of men
differ with the aire; and
the soule like the body,
commonly savours some|thing
of the company it
keepes, and we grow fa|miliar
with their sinnes,
together with their per|sons;
at first winke at
them, then imitate them,
then defend them. I will
not bee more scrupulous
<PB N="34" REF="21">
in the choyce of any
thing than of this: hee
can hardly have a <HI>good</HI>
soule, that hath a <HI>bad</HI>
companion.</P>
<P>Sinne at first is mo|dest,
and goes disguised
with <HI>Saul</HI> to <HI>Endor,</HI> that
after a while growes im|pudent,
and dares looke
bare-fac'd on the world;
first perswades to civill
recreations, thence bids
to unlawfull delights.
Hee that will prevent
the <HI>growth</HI> of sinne, must
resist the <HI>beginning;</HI> the
remedy is thought of too
late, where the disease is
<PB N="35" REF="21">
past cure; 'tis easier pre|venting
a sicknesse, than
recovering it.</P>
<P>Custome as it lessens
favours, so it lessens sins;
else the same sinne would
still be monstrous, which
in time is not taken no|tice
of.</P>
<P>Goodnesse is not the
gift of all but some, but
perseverance onely of a
few; how many like <HI>Eze|kiahs</HI>
sun have gone back|ward,
and forsaken their
first love? How many
have we seene, that with
<PB N="36" REF="22">
<HI>Caiaphas,</HI> would have rent
their cloaths at the name
of blasphemie, have after|ward
sworne by the life
of <HI>Pharaoh:</HI> what we <HI>are,</HI> is
no argument for what we
<HI>will be;</HI> every man knows
his beginning, not his end;
what hee is, not what he
shall be; let him that thin+keth
he stands, take heed
lest he fall.</P>
<P>When I take a serious
view of my selfe, and see
(besides inward discon|tents)
so many outward
enemies of quietnesse
every where, every mi|nute;
want, sicknesse, dan|gers,
<PB N="37" REF="22">
losse of friends, of
health, of life, threatning
if not pursuing me: and
to these my spirituall ene|mies
so strong, my cor|ruptions
so many, my in|firmities
so continuall,
and my selfe so over|matched
with all these:
with <HI>Peter</HI> I beginne to
sinke, and I could wish I
had not beene, since I
must be miserable, but
when I looke up to hea|ven,
and those joyes I am
going to, I would not be
lesse miserable to be so
happie. GOD is my Fa|ther,
the Angels are my
fellowes&punc; Heaven is my
<PB N="38" REF="23">
Inheritance; now if my
inheritance be in heaven,
why is not my desire
there? Where our trea|sure
is, there will our
heart be also, where our
treasure and our heart is,
there shall we be one day:
who would exchange his
future happinesse for a
present?</P>
<P>Contentation is a bles|sing,
not wealth; true ri|ches
consist not so in ha|ving
much, as in not de|siring
more: why&punc; then
doe wee so labour to <HI>a|bound,</HI>
and not rather to
be <HI>content?</HI> If I have but a

<P>Injuries, if they dye

<P>The malicious man is
so much no mans foe as
his owne; for while he is

<P>GOD lookes not at

<P>To doe well and say
nothing is Christianly,
to say well and doe no|thing

<P>Commonly your

never any man repented

him of saying nothing.</P>
<P>A Parasite of all Trades
is the basest, and in two
things like an Eccho; first,
that he speakes only what

he is nothing but voice,
words: next to an <HI>un|gratefull</HI>

not be a <HI>flatterer.</HI></P>
<P>Sinnes grow like
Grapes close, but in clu|sters:
Wee usually say,
He that will sweare, will
lye; and he that will lye,

doe any thing. Satan

<P>It is better to goe into

Hee takes little thought
for his sinnes, that thinkes

that truly considers those
joyes which never shall

<PB N="52" REF="30">
but desire to have an end
of these: Where the trea|sure

heart be also.</P>
<P>Gods promises doe
not binde Him to keep us

towards God, such shall
wee finde God towards
us; now if we doe smart,
thanke our selves.</P>
<P>Wee have too many
that have a double heart
in one body, but very
few that have but one
heart to two bodies, yet
so is it with friends, the
one ca~not laugh when the
other weepes; one friend
is the looking glasse of
the other, where face an|swers
face, when the one
smiles the other smiles,
when the one is sad the o|ther

Amity where there is no

Sympathy; If I doe not
suffer in my SAVIOVR,
I doe not love Him. Can
the Head be ficke and the
Body not feele it.</P>
<P>There is a time to
laugh as well as a time to
mourne, we are not de|ny'd
the use of mirth, but
the excesse, it is not for|bidden
Fruit. Hee who
gave Oyle to cheere the

World, were to single
out our selves to God:
And because He hath for|bid
the abuse of things,
not to use them; thus
we should abstaine from
drink, because some men

if we doe not abuse them
wee shall be commended
for our temperance: we

<P>God ever helpes at a

fail then is He seen, when
<HI>Iacob</HI> wants at home then
<HI>Ioseph</HI> is heard of abroad,

<P>Selfe-conceitednesse is

ashamed of what hee is

<P>Malice never wants a

<HI>nothing,</HI> hath <HI>something</HI> to
bee envied for, and if no|thing
else, he is envied
for this, that he is content
with his <HI>nothing.</HI> It is
hard to bee prosperous,
and bee loved at once:
Those that will be great,
shall be envied; it is hard
but safe, to be contented
with a little: but if I
cannot avoyd ill tongues,
my care shall be no to

let <HI>Shimei</HI> curse.</P>
<P>I seldome see sinne but
in a religious tire: Nay
<HI>but I reserv'd them for sa|crifice,</HI>
was <HI>Sauls</HI> to <HI>Samu|el:</HI>
for sacrifice not for
prey. Goodnesse is the
best disguise of evill, ei|ther
<HI>seeme</HI> what thou art,
or be what thou <HI>seemest:
God</HI> is not mocked.</P>
<P>Their sinne is more
unpardonable that sinne
of purpose: malice leaves
the owner as without ex|cuse
so without hope:
Sinnes of ignorance ex|cuse
<PB N="140" REF="74">
a <HI>tanto,</HI> save some
blowes. I may and doe
sinne dayly against my
will, I will not against my
knowledge.</P>
<P>What more glorious
Master than <HI>God?</HI> What
better Mother than the
Church? How glorious
is that calling that at once
serves such a Master, and
such a Mother? As it is
our glory to <HI>serve</HI> them,
so it must be our glory to
doe them good <HI>service.</HI>
God in us sets the world
copies of piety, and wee
must live to others no
lesse than preach: As we

are more <HI>eye,</HI> so we are
more <HI>look'd</HI> at, <HI>motes</HI> in
others eyes are <HI>beames</HI> in

lawfull that are not expe|dient,
and some things are
expedient in respect of
the <HI>person,</HI> that are scan|dalous
meerely for the
<HI>chaire;</HI> that which is re|proveable
in another, is
in us a reproach: seeing
it is so, what manner of
men ought we to be.</P>
<P>Promotions are neither
from the East nor from
the West, but from God:
He that hath them and
not of His gift, hath them
<PB N="142" REF="75">
with a vengeance who
would not rather wish to
want, than to be great so.</P>
<P>There was never any

every man is borne a <HI>Co|rah,</HI>
onely some more su|perlative

of all men I most won|der
at those that are am|bitious
onely to be talk'd
of, and since they cannot
bee <HI>notable</HI> they would
bee <HI>notorious,</HI> and with
<HI>Cain</HI> bee mark'd though
for murtherers. Whether
I know much, or am
knowne of many, it mat|ters
not, onely this I

will care for, that God
may not say to me in the

<P>Pride is good to none,

that which I know shall
repent me: what com|mendations
is it to have

beene some-body?</P>
<P>The tongue is the on|ly
betrayer of the minde:
The foole while he is si|lent
is not discovered. I

<P>There is but one thing
a Christian need desire of

there is but this one thing
that God desires of a

good at the hands of the

Goodnes goes not

<HI>God,</HI> but with <HI>repining;</HI>
so it is hard in <HI>prosperity,</HI>
to remember themselves,
and what they have re|ceiv'd
of <HI>God;</HI> we are apt
to forget what wee have
bin, when we are chang'd
for the better; <HI>Pharaoh's</HI>
butler hath forgot he was
a prisoner: it is too true,
that too many love <HI>God</HI>
for their owne sakes, ei|ther
they are <HI>poore,</HI> and
would be rais'd; or they
are <HI>sicke</HI> and would bee
heal'd; and like <HI>beggers,</HI>
no sooner are they <HI>serv'd</HI>
<PB N="178" REF="173">
but they are gone. I may
both love my <HI>selfe,</HI> and
<HI>God;</HI> I may not love <HI>God</HI>
for my selfe, I would not
love my selfe but for that
I am <HI>His,</HI> and I will love
Him but for Himselfe.</P>
<P>When I consider the
yeeres I have already li+ved,
me thinkes they are
<HI>few,</HI> but <HI>evill;</HI> evill not in
respect of <HI>affliction</HI> alone,
but of <HI>sin,</HI> and I am found
guilty: if I consider the
present, (if there be any
<HI>present,</HI> when it is ever
<HI>passing</HI>) I do but adde to
my score, and if I consi|der
the time to come (if
<PB N="179" REF="173">
I have any to come, <HI>God</HI>
knowes) I do but adde to
the measure of my owne
sinnes, and <HI>Gods</HI> wrath
together with my yeeres;
since I must live, and can|not
but sinne, I will stu|dy
how my sinnes may
not hinder me of a better
life; first, I will <HI>abhorre
them,</HI> and then I will ab|horre
<HI>my selfe</HI> for them;
and if I could not before
break my heart of them,
I will now breake it for
them: <HI>A broken and a con|trite
heart, O God, thou
wilt not despise.</HI></P>

To <HI>every</HI> one it shall
<HI>one</HI> day be sayd; <HI>Give an

everie man should tell
himselfe and one tell ano|ther,
what the <HI>Apostle</HI>
hath long since told us
all, that we must all stand
before the tribunall seate
of Almightie GOD;
the <HI>righteous</HI> thinkes long
of this day, and longs
for it; because hee is
long since provided for it;
the <HI>wicked</HI> thinks it coms
too fast, and yet thinkes
not of it till it come; and
when it is come, can
think of nothing but <HI>that,</HI>
<PB N="181" REF="174">
and is stown'd with the
thought of it: his plea|sures
which were never
but <HI>shadowes</HI> (yet accoun|ted
recall) then appeare as
they <HI>were,</HI> and not as they
were <HI>accounted;</HI> and those
<HI>torments</HI> which were ever

then appeare as
they are, and prove <HI>reall:</HI>
the comparing of what

lesse than <HI>nothing</HI> of
time which he hath liv'd,
with the <HI>eternitie</HI> of tor|ment,
hee is to dye in,
makes him curse the time
of his birth, since there
<PB N="182" REF="175">
is a time of <HI>death,</HI> and a|nother
death beyond all
<HI>time;</HI> so the <HI>godly</HI> and the
<HI>wicked</HI> differ not more in
their <HI>lives,</HI> than in their
<HI>deaths,</HI> but most of all
<HI>after</HI> death. Oh my <HI>God!</HI>
as thou hast made mee
of the best sort of crea|tures,
a <HI>man,</HI> and of the
best of that sort, a <HI>chri|stian;</HI>
so let mee be yet
better, by beeing one of

<P>All bookes are not a|like
easie; those that are,
<PB N="183" REF="175">
are not all alike profita|ble;
some would profit
more, if they did but rel|lish,
others would rellish
better, if they were more
profitable; he doth well
that doth both, <HI>utile dulci;</HI>
I will neither drowne my
meat in sauce, nor dish it
dry.</P>
<P>They are not the only
robbers that breake hou|ses,
guile is worse theft
than outrage; it is alike
wicked to make wine of
other mens grapes (as <HI>A|hab</HI>
did of <HI>Naboth's</HI>) and
to be drunk of our owne;
hee that will have riches
<PB N="184" REF="176">
in spight of heaven shall
have hell to boote.</P>
<P>The malicious man is
his owne moth; that <HI>God</HI>
is better to him than hee
can expect, is nothing,
whilest He is better to o|thers
than Hee is to him:
like <HI>Gideon's</HI> first miracle
hee would have all the
ground dry but his fleece;
if <HI>Cain's</HI> sacrifice miscary,
<HI>Abel</HI> must not bee accep|ted
and live; no man may
bee either <HI>greater</HI> or bet|ter
with safetie. I will not
looke at what I <HI>have,</HI> but
what I <HI>deserve,</HI> and I shall
never thinke my&punc; owne
<PB N="185" REF="176">
little, or anothers too
much: that is a <HI>wicked</HI>
heart that would have
all men <HI>worse</HI> than it selfe,
and <HI>hates</HI> all those whom
others thinke better.</P>
<P>God is therfore boun|tifull
to us, that we might
be so to others; to feast
those, that cannot bid us
againe, and to build for
those that cannot lodge
us againe, is the way to
that marriage-feast, and
those buildings, whose
Builder &amp; Maker is <HI>God:</HI>
he alone hath the true use
of wealth that receives
it onely to disburse it; if
<PB N="186" REF="177">
of wealth that receives it
only to disburse it; if men
were their owne friends
they would make others
so with this Mammon;
why should the rust of
that gold rise up in judge|ment
against thee, the
use of which will set thee
with those that shall sit
in judgement?</P>
<P>Persecution is the dore
to happines, <HI>Canaan</HI> hath
still the same way, a wil|dernesse;
who can looke
for heaven cheape, that
sees his SAVIOVR blee|ding?
I may not afflict
my selfe, yet I shall su|spect
<PB N="187" REF="177">
my selfe without
affliction; calmes are
no lesse dangerous than
stormes.</P>
<P>Some men doe not
climbe, but vault into
preferment at a leape; I
know not their sleight, I
mistrust their quicknesse;
few men were ever great
and good in an instant.
All the harme I wish
these, is, that their early
rising do them no harme;
they that are their owne
brokers in these, are like|ly
their owne theeves in
better; and steale them|selves
out of heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="178">
Favours are more bin|ding,
but aflictions are
more profitable; to have
much is more glorie, but
to be content with that
we have is more victory;
there is no conquest like
that of our selves, no con|quest
of our selves like
that of want; it is a hard
matter not to find pover|ty
a burden, or prosperity
a snare; this religion ob|tains
us, that if we are not
<HI>richer</HI> than others, yet we
are content to be poorer;
he only hath enough that
would have no more.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="178">
Our endevors are in
vaine without <HI>God's</HI> bles|sing,
yet in vaine shall he
challenge a blessing that
endevors not; sloth is
no lesse guiltie than <HI>cove|teousnesse.</HI>
I can doe no|thing
without <HI>God,</HI> yet I
will not looke <HI>God</HI> shall
doe all.</P>
<P>The cause of all pu|nishment
is sinne; and
the end of all sinne is pu|nishment.
Either pre|sent
or to come; how
then doe we love to be
punished, and yet love
to sinne? if we could but
be innocent, we could not
<PB N="190" REF="179">
but be safe; while I am
here I cannot but sinne,
but I hope to avoid the
punishment through Him
who hath borne the pu|nishment
and the sinne.</P>
<P>Our life is but a breath;
at first God breath'd up|on
man the breath of life,
&amp;c. And it is gone with a
breath, if He breath upon
us in displeasure we die,
for at the breath of His
nostrills wee are all con|sum'd:
since we doe not
live but by His leave,
why doe we not live to
His glorie? Oh God, I
have not liv'd long, yet
<PB N="191" REF="179">
so much of my life as I
have not liv'd to thee, I
have liv'd too much; all I
desire is, that as this life
was thy gift to me, so it
may be my gift to thee; I
I can afford God little, if
not His owne.</P>
<P>All punishments are
from the same hand, <HI>Iobs</HI>
boyles are no lesse Gods
finger than <HI>Pharaohs;</HI> but
all are not with the same
end; those are but chast|nings
upon some, that are
judgements upon others.
God strikes His owne be|cause
He loves them, He
strikes the wicked because
<PB N="190" REF="180">
they love not Him; those Hee
corrects but these He executes; it
is a signe Hee loves us when Hee
strikes us, and if his strokes bring
us to love him, wee may brag
with <HI>David,</HI> it is good for us that
we have beene afflicted.</P>
<P><HI>God</HI> is all eare and all eye, and
all in all; grant <HI>Lord,</HI> that as I am
alwaies <HI>seene</HI> of thee, so I may be
alwaies <HI>heard</HI> of thee: and may
alwaies <HI>heare</HI> thee in thy <HI>Word,</HI>
and contemplate thee in thy
<HI>workes;</HI> that I may one day see as
I am seene, and heare and bee
heard in that heavenly quire of
<HI>Hallelujah's, Glorie, and power,
and honour be unto the Lambe, and
to Him that sitteth on the Throne,
for evermore.</HI> Amen.</P>
