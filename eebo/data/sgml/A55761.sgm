<L>I'Ll not enquire why this All-knowing Age</L>
<L>Hath crop'd the <HI>Laurell,</HI> that adorn'd the <HI>Stage,</HI></L>
<L>That <HI>Loooking-Glasse</HI> of Morals, whose reflex</L>
<L>Shew'd most their errors, whom it most did vex.</L>
<L>But this I'le say, who e're the Author be</L>
<L>Of this same piece, if't were my chance to see</L>
<L>Him; as I have this issue of his brain,</L>
<L>I'de beg the favour, that hee'd write again;</L>
<L>For till I read it from the self same pen,</L>
<L>Such height of Sense and Wit, I ne're agen</L>
<L>Shall hope to see; a strain (when read) you'l say,</L>
<L>(As many things now are) in a <HI>new</HI> way.</L>
<L>Here's Comick mirth, yet mix't with serious lines,</L>
<L>As if the Author had dig'd up the mines</L>
<L>Of <HI>Mercury</HI> and <HI>Plato,</HI> and cull'd thence</L>
<L>Their chiefest treasure, and would it dispense</L>
<L>In plain, though lively phrase. Here's no <HI>Courts,</HI> no <HI>Kings,</HI></L>
<L>(I do suppose the Author thought such things</L>
<L>Not now in use.) And what is yet more rare,</L>
<L>Here is no <HI>dabling Poet,</HI> no nor <HI>bare,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Poor Belgick Captain</HI>; But what's most a wonder,</L>

<L>Upon <HI>Parnassus,</HI> or a storie take</L>
<L>From <HI>Lucian.</HI> I shall puzzle you, you'l cry,</L>
<L>What a deuce then can this play e're be? Why</L>

<P>What things&punc; I pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>You need not make so strange, for I know all: there is a Lad, they say, that smites and kils where e're he comes, and you are she in whom he intends to finish all his Conquests.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cris.</SPEAKER>
<P>Smite! and kil! Where e're he comes! Why, I hope, it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot the old bald fellow with the Sithe on his neck, old Monsieur Time? Smite, and kill! Strange, terrible words! What meanest thou?</P>
</SP>

<P>I mean, he makes them talk or dream of him for a week, or so, or perhaps sigh or whine a little.</P>

<P>Hold there, as for talking or dreaming I am for you, but do you think I e're shall sigh for him? I know whom you mean.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cris.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet the man deserveth well, as men now are. He is (I must confesse) a handsom sprightful youth, well qualified in most things that become a Gentleman: and since it is my friends desire that I should marry, he is one (I think) I should not be ashamed in company to own for a Husband.</P>

<P>O my unhappy fortune!<STAGE>Aside.</STAGE></P>

<P>The man I don't dislike, 'tis possible I might stay for a worse; and as possible, if I did stay, I might have a better, for I see nothing in him in which I could place my happiness.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="4">
<SPEAKER>Pat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Believe me, thou lovest him with a pretty indifferent love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her Love was certainly articled and agreed on by the old man her father. But let us find somewhat else to entertain the time withal. And now I think of it, what was that Gentlewoman who was there last night in the Sky coloured Satten Gown?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pat.</SPEAKER>
<P>O she is one of the great wits of the Town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought so, yet Mr. <HI>Welbred</HI> put her shrewdly to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her mind runs on nothing but <HI>Welbred,</HI> I think.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cris.</SPEAKER>
<P>They say that thou too (Affection) goest for a kind of Coun|try wit, what e're thou ailest to be thus sober here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sitting up so late last night hath somewhat disordered me, I confesse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cris.</SPEAKER>
<P>But as thou hopest to be married under thirty, think not of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I pray? for that is somewhat a terrible Conjuration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cris.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why? A female wit is a strange prodigious kind of thing, it frights off all that have no wit, and they that have will never come on, except it be for an Afternoon or so, to exercise their tongues. I have been out of conceit with it ever since I heard a Gentleman say, that he was going to a Lady that I know, a reputed wit, to prepare him for a Visit to his Mistris. Fye upon it, a thing fit for nothing, but to make one a common courting stock. I hate the very thought of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, if we must not think on them that have wit, let us think on them that have none: and first, how did you like the Gentleman that was there last night with the black curled hair:</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pat.</SPEAKER>
<P>With the black curled hair?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cris.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, I know whom she means, it was a friend of that same Gen|tlewomans, she was here with him this morning to invite me to such another businesse to night. But why, I pray, dost thou take him to have no wit? Doth he pay all the Reckonings where e're he comes? Will he drink deep with a Lad that will keep a brace of Geldings and a Lac|quey out of twenty pound a year? A dammee Captain, or an <HI>Oxford</HI> Majo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and then game with them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I dare pass my word for him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cris.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, these are the only modern fools.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I cannot tell what you call a fool, (I must confesse) I am a little too young to be his Godmother, but yet me thinks, a dull and stupid thing (as I conceive him to be) should have a name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pate.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure if he had had any thing in him, there was a Lady gave him a fair opportunity to shew it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Welbred</HI> would have paid her home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pat.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was a great while in doubt whether he could speak or no.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cris.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I cannot tell,&mdash;for ought I know, he might serve with a good Jointure to boot; for my part, I saw him do nothing much ab|surd. And had you been here to day, you would have thought his si|lence last night, to have been more out of choice then any thing else.</P>

<P>My Cozen too is certainly in love with him, for I have ob|served her mind all this day strangely musing, although sometimes it be disguised with some forced flashes of mirth: what e're is talked of, her thoughts still run on him, and then she will recal her self, not think|ing that affected hiding shewes what else would ne're be mark'd.&mdash; 'Tis strange to see how generally this Gentleman doth take: For my part, as I see not any thing in him that I much mislike, so truly naught that I admire: He has (I must confesse) some graceful and becom|ing parts and qualities, a handsome way in talk; yet when I mark it seriously, me thinks it is as curious Pictures, which (although they make a pleasing shew, yet) for the most part are drawn on course and ordinary matter. I needs must say, he has this happinesse, that if he excel in ought, it is in things of that familiar nature, that each place and company he comes in, afford him opportunity to shew it. And this certainly is the only thing that makes him make a greater blaze then some of far more worth, whose eminence lying in that which is more choice, cannot so frequently discover it self, nor is their value prostituted unto every eye; but they, as great Bels, who are not easily nor on all slight occasions raised, yet being up, will far out sound any of these tinckling ting-tang blades.&mdash;Would heaven alot me but such a one to spend my time withal, it would be what I most desire; but yet I think I shall scarce run that odious fortune of a stale Maid in expecta|tion of such a blessing. <STAGE>Enter Maid.</STAGE></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>He will not out of my mind, but doth over rule my thoughts and force them to desires vaine and impossible: I impossible, for h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> must needs fix on her, she is a Lady so without exception, of so fair a Fortune and such exquisite parts improved unto the height. He cer|tainly then is hers; me thinks the very thought of that should be e|nough to master these desires; for usually Objects, though ne're so pleasing, if not probable, searce stir the mind; for since we all are rational, it were absurd our wills should act in vain. But on the con|trary, when things with ease may be attained, we never give over until we are arrived at the utmost of our wishes. Thus nothing is more ordinary then for my Lady to love her Gentleman, or Mrs. <HI>Anne</HI> her fathers man. But if a Country Clowne coming up hither, and seeking for his Lawyer in Grayes Inne, should step into the Walks, and there should chance to spye some Master-piece of Nature, some fam'd Beau|ty, that for a time hath born the name, he would stand amazed, per|haps wish that his <HI>Ione</HI> were such, but farther would not be stirred, impossibility would stop more bold desires, and quench those sparks that else would turne to fires. But I without the remedy of hope, even in despair, begin a love that promiseth nought but grief and endlesse teares. But here he comes with my Cozen, I will stand and hear what they say. <STAGE>Enter Welbred and Crisis.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come sweet Lady be no longer cruel, 'tis fit for vulgar com|mon beauties to inhance the price of their Enjoyment by a long de|nyal; such Art were vain in you, and desperate in me, since I al|ready am wound up unto the highest, and higher cannot go but break.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cris.</SPEAKER>
<P>Must I answer to all this presently? that me thinks would bee the greatest inequality in the world; in all reason certainly I should have as much time as you had to study it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Study it? He that is inspired doth not so little deliberate; I speak my very thoughts, on you my mind doth naturally run, nor can it va|ry, for Nature that hath in you raised Beauty to its highest pitch, out|done her own Idea's, hath thereby made you Commandresse of my soul, and all its passions and affects to wait on none but you; there|fore seeing you have the power, O do no longer tyrranize.</P>

<P>Nay, pray now let me go, for you have me not yet, I must first chide you a little for this kind of language. What things do you think us women to be? Or rather, what would you have us our selves to fancy? For could I, me thinks, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> look into the brest of some fond silly Gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le, and see what thoughts she entertaines, by that time such a blade as you hath told her some such stories, that she gives Beauty being, and other faces to be accounted of as they partake of hers; that she can smite, wound, kill, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as if the fate of all mankind did hang upon her will, and twenty such things more, which if the poor thing have but wit enough to u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">derstand, she is (without mercy) ru|in'd, lost, undone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Well.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I pray, Lady? for this is somewhat strange.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cris.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll warrant you I have a reason for what I say; for fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st, she thinks her self somewhat (though what she cannot tell) that hath a just quarrel to Fate, that she can have nought but so poor a thing as man her mate; she fancies not this mean, she fancies not ano|thers Discourse, she hates this mans breeding, she hates anothers face, and for that coloured hair she refuseth a thousand pounds a year. Thus she continues for some years, until at the last, about some twenty nine, she doth begin to understand herself. But now the tide of Sutors and her beauty being eb'd, she stands a Fare for the next that comes; and in all haste she makes some desperate match, proves some old mans Nurse; perchance not so well, but <HI>Will</HI> her fathers man, her Taylor, or some Reformado Captain must serve her turne; or else (if she have any spirit) in a melancholy pet, she vowes a Virgin life, and for his sake that first deceived her, turnes man-hater. Come, come, in faith Sir you are to blame, were I now some kind of Lasse, forty to one but that I were meerely cozened of a good Hus|band.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Wel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did one ever see such a plaguy Wench as this?&mdash; <STAGE>Aside.</STAGE> Not at all, Madam, are we to be blamed for what we are forced unto, such high flowne speeches are no more then what all will challenge, Epithites not of the fair, but woman, meer Titles due by custome and long use, nor can they be denyed without breach of Civility: Al|though I must confesse sometimes, I give them with as much regret as when I call some base poor spirited thing Right Honourable.</P>

<P>I must confess (Madam) there hath an accident or two fal|len out of late, that hath taken me up, and made me extremely unci|vil in this nature unto all my friends; I shall certainly be weary of these Duels in the end, if it be but for this cause.</P>

<P>These Duels (Madam) I must confesse, are businesses of dan|ger enough; but that is a thing which he that values his honour and reputation, must not entertain a thought of.&mdash; But yet at the first, I must needs say, they seemed somewhat strange; but now me thinks they are nothing, I look upon them as a meer Exercise; I cannot scarce eat a Dinner with a good appetite until I have fought one: They clearly save me forty shillings a Month unto my Fencing Ma|ster.</P>

<P>Not at all, Madam, for the Lye is the highest affront that can be given, and so is the French mode, for once <HI>Fran&Ccedil;ois de Valois,</HI> the French King, upon an affront that <HI>Charles</HI> the Emperor put upon him, sent him a Challenge, in which he gave him the Lye; the Emperor refusing to answer him, the French ever since in Complement to their King have esteemed it the highest affront that can possibly be put upon a man.</P>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>It is impossible, Lady, except you should alter the Fabrick of his mind, unbend its appetite, or give it new desires; for as long as the divine soul creating breath, is clad with different disposing matter, and cast in several moulds, there will be Wise and Fooles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cris.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, if he were a natural Fool, I should yeeld much to your opinion, but in my mind his chiefest unhappiness is, only to have set his mind on some odd fancies, which if we could perswade him out of, he would be (at the least) not ridiculous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Know.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lady, 'tis likely you may know him a great deal better then I, for, I must confesse, altho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gh he be one that I see almost every day in the streets, yet of all men living I have the least acquaintance with him: wherefore (Madam) if you please to make my knowledge to be so far indebted to you, as to let me a little more fully understand him, I shall take it as no mean favour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cris.</SPEAKER>
<P>That Sir would be a very tedious task.</P>

Lady that is drest, and hath dined, as I suppose you have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cris.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well Cozen, if you will help me, I will venture on it then. And to begin, Sir this Gentleman (as I have said) although he doth appear ridiculous enough, yet in my opinion not so much by nature as unlucky chance: for as when some common metals will serve for good substantial use, yet if you strive to force them to more curious shapes, they only such rude draughts will take as will render them more deformed: So this Gentleman (had his courser soul but had the luck to have acted in some downright way, to have managed some plod|ding Trade) he might by long experience have understood himselfe within his Sphere; nay, have had wit enough to have got a good E|state, and through the repute of that, have been look'd upon by the world as wise; but this by his fathers industry being left to his hand, the common course of the world, unhappily doth fling him upon things fit only for more refined minds; which although he cannot master, yet some odde grudges and imperfect stamps have transformed him from what he was, nor can he be what he would.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>So (Sir) that some laugh at him, some wonder, as one would at some monstrous thing; some, indigested vain attempt of Na|ture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cris</SPEAKER>
<P>And first Sir, his Fortunes enabling him to keep variety of company; he hears indeed all sorts of wit enough, but that being a thing too subtile for his soul, naught stayes with him, but some few words and phrases, which he rudely plucking from that natural chaine that linck'd them with appropriating circumstances, shew very strange|ly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Know.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not much unlike (Lady) the relicks of those species, which (although in a methodick way, and by the discursive hints of thought are represented to the mind, yet) in a dream appear with casual conse|quence, the fancie making absurd contradictions, whilst at one act it doth rethink things treasured up in different time and place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cris.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right Sir; for with some conceited speech, he is your Ser|vant; what e're you answer, on he goeth to what is next in h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s me|mory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SP>

<P>He thinks that if he could go handsomly through with a quar|rel without receiving a baffle, according to these Laws, he hath done more, and hath got more honour and repute then e're <HI>Montross,</HI> the <HI>Sweden</HI> King or <HI>Scanderbag.</HI></P>

<P>Come, Mr. <HI>La-gul,</HI> the truth of it is, your Quarrel was not an hour old before I heard of it; and I being extremely sensible of your danger, began to think how I might possibly procure your safety, at the last came into my mind a Gentleman, one that is an intimate friend of this same <HI>Casters,</HI> whom I have some acquaintance with.

<P>What?</P>

<P>200 l. I cannot Sir by no means, you know how much I have lost of late.</P>
</SP>

<P>That is all one, he knows your credit is good; and if you should deny him this small favour, he is somewhat a humoursome fellow, and I cannot tell whether ever I should perswade him to serve you in this same businesse; and yet I know he is the only man that can do it.</P>

of late hath been so abused, that) <HI>I</HI> scarce can tell.

<P>But these kind of men are not competent Judges of what in us they call rash; for wee shall see, when any thing doth happen that doth concerne them in the way they have taken for to ac|quire a value and esteeme, They will act things as strange and inordinate: You shall have a man made up of meekenesse; A man, whose life and doctrine preacheth nothing else but patience and compliance unto others; yet he will venture for to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">end both Church and State, nay, tear the world in pieces, rather then yeeld himself worsted in one silly argument.</P>

<P>What a high piece of madnesse have I done, thus to lose my life about a trifle!

<P>What dishonour had it been to me, if by my wife declining I had gi|ven some cause to think I had fear'd them, more then if in such case I had avoided a Beare or Oxe; for Honour, certainly, is nothing else but that respect and value that those things do draw, which buoy and prop one up in the world.

<SPEAKER>Old Cris.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Know-well,</HI> I ever have had that opinion of you, that I do not a little wonder, that you, of all men, should speak thus if you speak according to your Judgement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Know.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, for my part, I speak what I think; for certainly, you have little reason to blame her thus.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Cris.</SPEAKER>
<P>Reason? though to her my will is reason sufficient; yet I would not have you believe that I speak without a cause. For do you think it doth become a sober, civil, modest Virgin, as I hope shee is, to follow all the several fashions, those fantastick changes, and whim|sical dances led by the vain and emp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y part of the world?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Know.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, for my part I could wish our habits were as constant as the course of nature, nor that we had more change of dress then birds or trees; but this I can but wish; for we see the generall humour of the world ever yet has been so set upon the contrary, that one can scarce discreetly hope it; nay, hee that would but a little strictly enquire and search into our natures, and mark how prone and apt they are for variety and change, might almost demonstrate its impossibility; for certainly, as long as in the world there are men of severall qualities and degrees, the inferiour, and more base will imitate the waies of those of better ranke, and strive to intrench upon, and gaine their customes; which being no sooner got by the one, but the other will despise them, and seek for new. Seeing then these alterations are so unavoidable, without doubt, it wil more become one in a moderate way to yeild unto, then vainely to oppose them. For whatsoever the riged do pretend, there is nothing can more argue a fan|tastick humor, or self-conceited pride, then with ones single whimseys to oppose what is received by the generality.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Cris.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis true Sir, I needs must yeeld thus far, for I should condemn her of the height of folly, should shee oppose the general use in things that are indifferent: but that I chiefly blame her is, for certaine knacks and fashions, which although in common use and custome, yet not being decent and comely in themselves, must needs be unlawfull.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Know.</SPEAKER>
<P>That, Sir, is impossible; for custome is the very square and rule of what is decent, and what not; indecency being nothing else but that harsh discord that any thing doth make, if it doth chance to inter|fere with the common course of things, and certainly, the soundest judg|ments wil not hold any habit to be simply in its self unlawfull. Thus much, indeed, must be granted, that some attires, by being first used by (and therefore being reckoned for the badges of) the vainer and more fantastick sort, may from them acquire some accidentall scandall, which afterwards (they growing into use, with the sober and more staid) by the same reason they must needs mew and let fall.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Cris.</SPEAKER>
<P>This Sir, is somewhat strange; for although I cannot tel to what narrow limits you may confine the word <HI>decency</HI> in its strictest notion, yet there is nothing more certain then that there are vain, light, &amp;
<PB N="34" REF="20">
immodest habits, of their proper nature abstracted from all those glosses that custome may fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng on them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Know.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly Sir, I think not, nor I believe will you, if you but consider the businesse a little more; for vanity is nothing else but the affectati|on of the signes of those things we really have not; as in attires, if the aged do usurp what doth belong to youth, the poor to the rich, the in|feriour to the more N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ble. Now Sir, what is it that doth define to each of these their severall Characterizing Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bes, but use and arbitrary Custome? And so farre is any habit in it self from representing what is grave or light, that should it please Om|nipotence, (as there is nothing impossible) but to invert the com|mon course of Nature, make those the markes of age, which are now of youth; the smooth chin would then be as reverend, as is now the bald head; Then should you have the grave and venerable s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lver haires bee worne in amorous wanton Bracelets. Nay, nothing in this kinde, but as to these respects, would have its alte|ration.</P>
<P>And as for Modesty; 'Tis true, although it bee a vertue alike re|quisite in all; yet, what those things are wherein 'tis exercised, Custome doth onely determine: You see here that familiar with our coyest, nicest Dames, which, in some places, would scarce be done by the most notorious strumpets; nay, what many times with us is but necessary, how strangely would it looke in the other sex? And I would faine know that man could give me a solid reason of this difference besides common custome. I am sure there can bee no habit whatsoever fancied to be so immodest, as wee should now account none at all to bee; yet there are some that with no slight rea|sons will maintaine our onely naturall dresse (were it but backed by a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nerall Custome) would bee the most innocent; and those desires which by restraint are now chiefly inflamed, would then grow cold and dull, as wee see some things which else-where are accounted a recompence sufficient for a stab, here through there facility are scarce valued; Nor was it said amisse of one who called clothes a meere device hatch'd in Madam <HI>Venus</HI> Clo|set; &mdash; for surely they are the greatest stratagem by which her Em|pire doth subsist.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Cris.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confesse, Sir, you do represent some things unto mee, which before I did not so cleerely marke; But yet (Sir) were it granted, that custome were the onely rule for what were to bee done in these kind of matters, yet those things for which I did find fault with her, have nor obtain'd a generall use; for if wee should goe presently into the stree<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, wee should see not one in forty use them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Know.</SPEAKER>
<P>Herein, Sir, doth lie the grand mistake; for as many se|verall sorts of men, the various accidents of for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">une doth produce; so many severall fashions doth common use alo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; nor is this more

then what hath beene provided for by publick lawes, in the best order'd Common-Wealths. Now Sir, If in my attire I do conforme myself to those of my degree, I never shall offend against the rule of decency; and for my part, I see nothing in her dresse, but what for some while hath generally been done by the civillest Ladies of her yeares and quality, especially in this place; for I must confesse, that may be star'd at in a Country towne, that here would bee but needfull. And this discourse, Sir, doth put me in mind of what I have known to have been the opinion of some Judicious men, that the dresse which of these late yeers hath been in request amongst us (what e're the aged out of their usuall vanity of magnifying their younger years wil say to the contrary) is the civillest, most comely, and less extravagant that hath been used for these many ages.</P>

<P>Why, was her first husband an old man?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sue.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, I Sir&punc; or else he never had had her, for I thinke there never was woman of so strange a humour as she is, in this world; for from her infancy, shee ever doted on old men; I have heard her say, that in these her late Law-troubles, it has been no small com|fort to her, that still she hath been conversant with grave Counsellers &amp; Sergeants, and what a happiness she has had to look somtimes an hour together upon the Judges. Shee will goe and walke a whole afternoone in Charter-house-Garden, on purpose to view the ancient Gentlemen there.</P>
<P>And if shee hear but of a man that is buried with as many old men following him, as he is years old, she wil go a mile to see it: There is an old beggar that uses to come hither somtimes that she wil talk with an

hour together: sometimes she will condole her self that she did not live before the floud, that she might have had one of those ancient Patriarks; the last year she was scarce perswaded, but that she would take a Journey into some of the far Northern Nations, where men do ordinarily live unto seven or eight score years of age. As we were coming by S. <HI>Dunstans</HI> not long ago, she spied the Picture of old <HI>Par,</HI> she needs would have the Coach stay until she had bought it, and since she has hung it up in her Closet, and will weep sometimes over it an hour together.</P>

content; we might have lived together with all the usual love, she might have made me a Father, and I have thought so; and if I should have lost her, I should have thought my self bereaved of one of those things that serve to pass away a troublesome life, as good company, or Sack.</P>

<P>You see, Sir, <HI>I</HI> am a woman, one of the most undervalued Creatures living; we never yet by any polity were allowed to meddle with any thing but a needle: We are not esteemed to know ought of rational but our wills; nay, some will not allow us for to know our wills.

Nay, <HI>I</HI> need must say, <HI>I</HI> have not seen more acute differen|cing and discerning spirits, then <HI>I</HI> have in some women; nor do <HI>I</HI> see any reason, but if they should improve and blow those natural sparks they are endued with, by the same means that we do use (neglecting those poor mechanick things to which the absurd humour of the world doth usually addict them) but that they would make a greater blaze then the most eminent of men. And such accomplishments meeting with the usual beauty and sweetnesse of their Sex, must needs extremely cap|tivate and ravish, nor would any thing come so nigh Divinity.</P>

<P>Well Sir, Although it were granted that there might be some|what possible in woman sitting to be valued, what were that to me? <HI>I</HI> should no more dare to believe my self owner of any such thing, then that I did possesse the Indies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>No!</P>
<P>Could I but upon as good an account believe you ever to be mine, I should believe my self to possesse more then them.</P>
<P>Come (dear Lady) will you give me but the least of hopes to enjoy what e're perfection it be that you are owner of? Shall I think ever to call it mine?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Truly (Sir) I think not, for.&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Know.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold Lady, let me have a little more warning before you in|tend to give me a stroak so mortal; do not in one instant make me a thing irrational, of no design. For since my hopes have once made you their end, there can nothing surely ever appear to me, so worthy as to fix a thought upon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cris.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, you did a little mistake me, for (as I think) I never did yet any thing that might encourage you to speak in this nature. So truly, thereby I needs must say, I did not intend to destroy what|soever hopes you have conceived of me; for that which I was a going to say, (had you but given me leave) was only this:</P>
<P>Suppose me Mistris of all the Wit and Parts that ever yet was incident to our Sex,</P>
<P>And (now I am supposing of such impossible things) suppose me (as you just now said) yours; what were that to you more then to all the world? for you could as well hope to appropriate the Air as such Ac|complishments. The Sun it self doth not afford more general and communicative influence then they would do.</P>
<P>Nay, perhaps as we now are, you might more enjoy such qualities; for what would wit in a wife serve for, but to interfere with yours. Nor have they been esteemed unwise, whom I have heard say, they could well spare all Judgment in one of that relation, save what were requisite to a handsome dresse, or so.&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Know.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am so far, Lady, from thinking so, that were that realwhich you now supposed, the greatest Epicure could not more enjoy what e're his sensual appetite doth prompt him to, then I should those perfecti|ons of your mind; for then we should not only be linked in that my|stical knot, nor with those more natural tyes and charmes, as you are woman or fair; but certainly we should close in that stricter conjun|cture of friend and friend, the greatest cement possible 'twixt humane souls.</P>
<P>And where it joines us with the more refin'd minds, it is a happinesse that the super-errogating Saint in his boldest error could never hope to merit. For to have one who as my better Genius, might regulate even in their first matter my imparted thoughts. What can be a greater bliss?</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="25">Or if I had any thing of worth or value in me, to have such a con|scient judge and witnesse, would almost imitate the pleasure that some in the thought of an all-knowing Deity, can in any mis-construed action solace themselves against the opinion of the world.</P>
<P>'Tis true, I know some kind of Madam, who perhaps, having some not unhappy vaine which a little too much taking with the world, might drive her into strange conceits of what shee scarce can tell, and make her prove as troublesome and crosse, as sometimes are the winds, and have as various and fantastick waies: but wee should no more thwart or differ from each other, then truth would doe from truth, the waies of judgment and discretion being as certaine and demonstrative: wee should anticipate each others thoughts, our a|ctions would be as harmonious as are those of Ants or Bees, as if by some secret law of nature we were designed to carry on some com|mon worke: what say you, Lady, should we not? shall I ever enjoy in you this happinesse?</P>
</SP>

<P>If not Sir. Your Fancy that hath thus largely supplyed all my defects, will easily make good to you a greater losse.</P>
</SP>

<P>Nay, Prethee be as serious as is the love I bear thee; and tell me freely and plainly what result that which you have observ'd of me hath wrought upon your thoughts; for this is the onely thing by which I must either stand or fall: for should I by intreaties seeke to force your will, 'twould be but vaine, since if you cannot afford, to answer my affection, they must needs make you loath, if not contemn and scorn me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cris.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shall I answer you then, and will you not be sorry?</P>

<P>Hold, for me thinks I stand with the same paine, that the pri|sones doth, that is to receive sentence either of life or death; faine would I be out of doubt, but loth I am to undergoe the trial; but speak, for certainly you have no condemning look.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="58" REF="32">
<SPEAKER>Had.</SPEAKER>
<P>That (Sir) in my mind, if you be in earnest, is somewhat strange; for although that the chance of dice is certain in it self, and doth (as all other things of chance) depend on sure and natural cau|ses; yet these causes either being unknown to us, or else not in our power, their effects must needs to us, before they come to pass, be also unknown; and from this ignorance, if thereby we are concerned, must needs arise a certain strife and Altercation of hopes and fears, which with no little pleasure doth affect the soul.</P>
<P>Now Sir, all pleasures by providence being created for our better be|ing, may rationally enough be (if but discreetly) used.</P>
<P>From hence it followes, that one may not only play at D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce, but also venture so much upon their chance, whereby these passions may arise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis true, Sir, if one venture no more; but to venture so much, as that the losse thereof may m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ke any considerable alteration in ones fortune, cannot but be (as he said) the height of folly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Why so, Sir&punc; For have I not as probable and rational hopes for to improve, as to impaire the same, Chance in reason being supposed impartial unto none?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, then said he, ones estate and fortune, being the principal thing that makes one to be valued in the world, I cannot certainly more rationally imply the force and vigour of my wit, then about that.</P>
<P>Now (Sir) in a thing that so much concernes me, wholly to balk whatsoever benefit my judgmen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> might afford, and put my self into such a way, where the starkest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ool has as much advantage as I, and more too, if the Proverb be t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> must needs, in any sober mans opinion render me a fool.&mdash;</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Had.</SPEAKER>
<P>That (Sir) is no marvel; for fools and knaves are the two main springs on which not only that, but all the world doth move; he that would have none of these, encounters providence, and would overturne the policy of the world: were all things of one temper, the Universe would not subsist one minute: were all men wise, the world would be at a stand, whilst each do prove unmalleable unto others designes.</P>

<P>But <HI>I</HI> had almost forgot one main thing, for as <HI>I</HI> was going, <HI>I</HI> met with an old companion of mine, one <HI>Will. Freeman</HI> by name.&mdash; An't like your Worship, <HI>I</HI> tell you no lye, for as they say, Tell the truth and shame the Divel.</P>

<P>Why, An't like your Worship, honest <HI>Will</HI> said <HI>I,</HI> it was a merry old world when you and <HI>I</HI> were Prentices together in Fetter|lane. And upon that, (an't like your Worship) he would needs have me go spend my two pence with him.</P>

<P>Well, 'tis no matter for his name,&mdash;but what of him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2.</SPEAKER>
<P>An't like your Worship, he would needs make us stay the drink|ing of his flaggon too; and by that time that was done, an't like your Worship, <HI>I</HI> began to think the shoulder of Mutton might be over|roasted, and therefore <HI>I</HI> made as much haste home as <HI>I</HI> could; and as <HI>I</HI> was coming along by the wall, imagining no hurt, nor thinking of no harm, O <HI>I</HI> saw the saddest and lamentable sight.&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Iust.</SPEAKER>

<P><HI>I</HI> never saw so much all the dayes of my life.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Iust.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what was it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>And <HI>I</HI> hope <HI>I</HI> shall never see the like again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Iust.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, what was it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, An't like your Worship, <HI>I</HI> saw a proper, goodly young Gentleman, as one shall see in a year and a day, lye in the most yearnful

condition, all in gore bloud, that it would have grieved any heart to have seen the like; and then this same young man came.&mdash;</P>

<P>Why, if it please your honourable worship, as I was going a long upon a very civil account, to carry a piece of Satin to a person of Honour, in the <HI>Peazza,</HI> in <HI>Lincolnes</HI> Inne fields, just under the wall, I chanc't to cast my eyes and view the aforesaid Gent. whose name is Mr. <HI>Well-bred,</HI> in the self same condition as this man has before specified and declared, and I upon that account dee|ming him to be dead, did debate with my selfe upon what ac|count the said Man-slaughter should happen; but I approaching neer|er, did descry him to be one that had been a customer to my Master, and I upon that account knowing his lodging, did desire this same man that upon that account he would be instrumentall in conveying him thither. And when upon that account we be|gan to stirre him, his wound upon that account began to bleed with a most extreme violence, in so much that I seeing his hand|kerchiefe, hang out of his pocket, did upon that account judge it requisite to pull it out, to helpe stop his wound; and pulling it out, I chanced upon that account to pull out a letter, which this man desiring me to read &mdash;</P>

<P>And Sir, if the knowledg of men be the chiefest wisdome, believe she is not unwise, for in them she is not a little experienced;shee will tell you (I believe) the difference betwixt the melancholy, and the sanguine, the fair, or the black haired youth: shee could perhaps from her own knowledg, mend the observations of <HI>Culpepper,</HI> or <HI>Aristotles</HI> problems, tell who doth afford most pleasure&punc; the hot <HI>Italian,</HI> or the tough <HI>Germain,</HI> the nimble <HI>French-man,</HI> or the grave <HI>Spaniard.</HI></P>

<P>Your Worship (I hope) by experience knowes, that such a thing may not be altogether impossible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Iust.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Gentlemen will you refer the businesse to me, upon that condition, that I do please you all?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1.</SPEAKER>
<P>I, Sir, upon that condition; but we shall not be pleased without our money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Iust.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, then I order you to give them their money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Slur.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then we shall not be pleased.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Iust.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but you shall: for now I am resolved upon a design, which I hope will be as good as building Hospitals.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, by the carriage of this businesse, I see you have more in you then ever I did take you for to have. And although you have been wild in your time, yet now I believe you would know how to value an estate.</P>
<P>First therefore, as for you Mr. <HI>Had- Land,</HI> what you have gotten by this device from me, I freely will let you enjoy.</P>
<P>And for these Gentlemen, I will give them that which shall maintaine them like themselves without these shifts.</P>
<P>To be short, Gentlemen, I have an Estate and never a child, and if you henceforward do nothing that may displease me more then this your dayes work hath done, I shall not be wanting in any thing that you may expect from a father. What, doth this please you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Slur.</SPEAKER>
<P>Beyond our expectation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cast.</SPEAKER>
<P>We, Sir, shall never be able to deserve this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Come, come, you have deserved it already.</P>
