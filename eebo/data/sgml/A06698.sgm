<P>_I feare vnlesse some men wyll accuse me of teme|rite &amp; rasshnes, seynge y^e so boldly I dare offer to youre ryghte honorable maystershyp thys lytle lucubracion &amp; worke, which I made now of late, &amp; entitled a Christmasse bancket, in asmuche as I haue ben so seldo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e in your co~pany, &amp; haue not attempted nor proued at any tyme perfectly by mutuall confabulacion howe youre mynde is affected towarde me. To thys I answere, that I syttynge at your table before syx monethes past where it pleased you very benignely to talke with me, perceyued in youre

maystershyp at that tyme, as at all other so great humanite, comite, ge~|tlenes &amp; affabilite towarde al men, y^t it hath syns that tyme greatly ani|mated and encouraged me to excogi+tate &amp; inuent somewhat y^t I myght dedicate to your name, trustyng by this meanes that your beneuolence toward me should not only be encre|sed, but also made consumate &amp; per|fecte. Whyle I sought diligently an argume~nt fytte &amp; worthy youre be|nignite, among all other it came to my reme~brau~ce that this tyme of y^e yeare men vse customab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ye to make feastes &amp; banckettes, and there vnto for to cal theyr fre~des, louers &amp; neigh+bours. Whan I considered this ma|ner &amp; custome, it dyd so much please me, seyng that mutual loue is mayn+tained therby, that hereof I toke an occasion also to make a Christmasse bancket. For I thought although I were poore &amp; not of habilite to make
<PB REF="3">
such a feast or ba~cket, as the custome requireth, yet I woulde accordyng to that kynde of rytches, which God hath indued me, prepare some banc|ket, &amp; call vnto it, not twenty or for+ty, but euen so many as wyll come, y^e all men myght co~mende Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ille ha|uynge no house of his owne, for hys housholde kepynge &amp; large maynte|na~ce of hospitalite. And for asmuch as ther shall not want vniuersal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, which shal make feastes for the body at this tyme, I thoughte it beste, to make my bancket, a bancket for the soule, y^t men hauynge theyr bodyes fedde of other, might also haue theyr soules fed at my hande. I haue ther|fore prepared a Bancket, not such a bancket,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioan. vi.</NOTE> as the meate wherof peris|sheth, corruptethe, and commethe to nought, but that abideth into euer|lastyng lyfe. And because it maye be a Christmasse bancket in dede, &amp; wor+thy wherat Christ should be present
<PB REF="4">
I haue garnysshed it with many de+licious, pleasaunt, deynte, yea &amp; hea|uenly dysshes of the moost holy scrip+tures. So that whosoeuer eateth of this bancket, shall fynde in it muche confortable noryshme~t for his soule &amp; be occasioned therby, I doubt not to geue God hertye thankes, whiche hath vouchedsafe of his deuyne cle|mency, &amp; vnmesurable goodnes, fre|ly to call him to his celestiall ba~cket. Woulde God that by this my ba~cket makynge, I might excyte &amp; moue o|ther to vse like co~municacio~ at their table, as they shall fynd here, or at y^e lees<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e that they woulde enterlase in some parte of theyr repast theyr tal|ke with suche honest &amp; godly wordes as they shall here read, &amp; vtterlye re|iecte &amp; cast awaye all fylthy and vn|cleane co~municacion, all iestynge &amp; raylyng, all blaspheming &amp; cursing. So shoulde they haue Christe more present wyth them at theyr feastes,
<PB REF="4">
than many haue nowe a dayes, at whose table such kynde of talke is v|sed, as may iustly seme not to be wor+thy of God &amp; his so~ne Iesus, but of Bacchus and Uenus. These be no Christmasse banckettes, but Christ|lesse &amp; dyuellysh bankettes. They be no feastes fytte for christen men, but for Gentiles &amp; Ethuyckes.
