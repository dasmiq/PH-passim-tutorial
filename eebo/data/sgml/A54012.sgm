<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>BEcause it looks too naked to fall immediately from Title-page to Page the First, the Reader, in lieu of Fig-leaves, or a Screen to come betwixt, is presented with a short <HI>Advertisement</HI> concerning the Nature, Powers, and Pri|vileges of <HI>Burlesque Verse.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Remarks</HI> thereupon, which the late Learned and Ingenious Sir <HI>Thomas Pope-Blount</HI> has collected from the Opinions of several Men, signifie little more than that it is not to be meddled with for fear of doing Mischief: And so it is shamefully discouraged and Brow-beaten by the <HI>Cri|ticks,</HI> because indeed they themselves are afraid of it.</P>
<P>Should we suppose the Chief of our dead <HI>English Poets</HI> holding a <HI>Sessions</HI> with those who are now living, I cannot imagine where they would place the Au|thor of <HI>Hudibras:</HI> To set him at the
<PB REF="3">
Upper End of the Table, above the Prin|ces of <HI>Epick</HI> and <HI>Heroick,</HI> would be ri|diculous; and no less so, to place him at the Bottom. In my Opinion he ought to be set, like <HI>Apemantus</HI> in the Play, at a Side-board by himself. <HI>Burlesque</HI> ta|king the Privileges of that surly <HI>Phi|losopher,</HI> no wonder if it is treated like him, but scurvily. But for the same Rea|son, why do not Men of the profoundest Literature and deepest Science fall foul on <HI>Cornelius Agrippa,</HI> for his ridiculing and shewing the <HI>Vanity of Arts and Sci|ences;</HI> or on <HI>Solomon</HI> himself, for his Divine Book of the <HI>Ecclesiastes?</HI> But not to go too far that way, I would rather here speak of the Laws of <HI>Burlesque,</HI> (if I knew any it had:) It stands indeed upon Four Feet; but its Liberties and Privile|ges are unbounded; and those Four Feet are, I think, by no means oblig'd to be but Eight Syllables; for in place of the Last, it is a part of its Excellency some|times
<PB REF="3">
to have Two, Three, or Four Syllables (like so many Claws) crowded into the Time of One Foot. The Duple and Triple <HI>Rhyme,</HI> in some other <HI>Poetry</HI> much bla|mable, are Beauties in this: And <HI>Bur|lesque</HI> esteems it no Fault, for <HI>Rymes</HI> sake, to borrow from any Language what|soever.</P>
<P>Its Nature is to Ridicule, Flatter, Huff, and Banter, by turns; to Scratch and Claw now, and anon to Grin and Bite like a <HI>Satyr.</HI></P>
<P>I am ignorant of the true Reason why it is call'd <HI>Doggerel;</HI> but I know a witty young Gentlewoman, who has a small Ta|lent that way, and she calls her own <HI>Bur|lesque, Bitcherel.</HI></P>
<P>It is wonderful to traverse its Arbitrary Power, how it proceeds without regard to <HI>Periods, Colons,</HI> or <HI>Comma's:</HI> How some|times it will change <HI>Accents</HI> for the sake of <HI>Rhyme,</HI> and, according to the most vulgar and careless Pronunciation, leave
<PB REF="4">
out what <HI>Consonants</HI> it pleases. It will end the Verse with a <HI>Preposition,</HI> and make <HI>Interjections</HI> at its own <HI>Libitum.</HI> It often uses <HI>Grammar</HI> so ill, that it will baulk <HI>Orthography</HI> it self, rather than not assert its own Prerogative. All the <HI>Tropes, Figures,</HI> and <HI>Flowers</HI> in <HI>Rhe|torick</HI> bend beneath it. The <HI>Synaelepha</HI> and <HI>Apostrophe,</HI> like two Executioners, are continually waiting upon its Absolute Will and Pleasure. Refining and Polish|ing, which gives Beauty to other <HI>Poetry,</HI> spoils this: As if the <HI>Printer</HI> should leave out the Flat Nose, Goggle Eyes, Hump Back, and Distorted Limbs, and call it <HI>The Picture of Aesop.</HI> It will break a Word in Two, and gather up the latter Part of it a good while after, when one would think it was quite lost. Sometimes it goes on with a long Bead-row of <HI>Mono|syllables</HI> together, and esteems it no Ble|mish; at another time, one single Word, or two at most, shall compose the whole
<PB REF="4">
Line. Endless it would indeed be to re|count its various Qualifications and wild Vagaries, or to say how many different Things it is like.</P>
<P>As true <HI>Heroick</HI> may be compar'd to a Beautiful Well-dress'd Lady, who, when she pays her Visit, lets down her Train at length, and advances with an even and graceful Motion; so <HI>Burlesque</HI> may be likened to her wanton Chamber-maid, with her Petti|coats tuck'd up, in her Masque and Pat|tens, who walks, runs, stumbles, stops, looks about, and laughs, and perhaps all in less than a Minute.</P>
<P>Among many other Comparisons, (which are Odious) one of the worst Things <HI>Bur|lesque</HI> may be likened to, is Mr. <HI>Bays's</HI> fierce <HI>Heroe</HI> in the <HI>Rehearsal;</HI> who frights his Mistriss, snubbs up Kings, baf|fles Armies, and does what he will, with|out regard to Numbers, Good Manners, or Iustice: And yet after all, this frightful Thing does no more harm, when set up|on
<PB REF="5">
proper Subjects, than Dogs that kill Vermin.</P>
<P>If the Author of <HI>Hudibras</HI> had a right or took liberty to ridicule particular Fa|ctions and Perswasions, as he thought them faulty, sure another Man must needs have the same Privilege to expose those who are apparently mischievous to Society, and de|structive to good Establish'd Government. Though I doubt whether ever any Man will arise with so transcendent a <HI>Genius</HI> and happy Talent for this purpose, as Mr. <HI>Butler;</HI> and great Pity it was, as well as Shame, that in one respect he was suffer'd to fall so low at the last.</P>
<P>If our <HI>Author</HI> be mistaken in his Con|ceipts about <HI>Burlesque,</HI> he presumes his Errors are of no dangerous Consequence; and for that Reason, is little concern'd about them. Therefore, without detaining the <HI>Reader</HI> any longer, he is desir'd to fall to the following <HI>Pages,</HI> and make the best of them.</P>

<L><PB N="132" REF="71">This useful Halter, if you please,</L>
<L>Would fain afford you the same Ease,</L>
<L>And free you by convenient Stretch</L>
<L>From growing more and more a Wretch.</L>

<L>More Instances I dare engage</L>
<L>To cite, and Arguments alledge,</L>
<L>To prove this Action truly needful,</L>
<L>And graceful for you, tho' 'tis dreadful:</L>
<L>But if you're scrupulous to do't,</L>
<L>Let these Five Motives press you to't.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>First then, You far in Years are gone,</L>
<L>And broke in Constitution;</L>
<L>Your Vigour fails, and Nat'ral Talent,</L>
<L>Which best should fit you for a Gallant,</L>
<L>Is now enfeebled, and become</L>
<L>Already a meer <HI>Pendulum.</HI></L>
<L>Yet by your Freaks, and Monkey-Tricks,</L>
<L>Do you debauch the weaker Sex.</L>
<L><PB N="133" REF="71">Not that the slender Wast of Miss</L>
<L>By you receives a Prejudice;</L>
<L>There your Efforts are ineffectual:</L>
<L>But on their slenderer Intellectual,</L>
<L>By the Fop doodle of your Wit,</L>
<L>What horrid Rapes do you commit?</L>
<L>And Ravishment, you know, is Death,</L>
<L><HI>Anno Dec. Oct. Elizabeth.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Secondly, Once for all to dangle,</L>
<L>Is better than continual Wrangle,</L>
<L>Than Roguing the King's best Leige people,</L>
<L>As meriting the Gallow Tripple,</L>
<L>Without affording the least Proof,</L>
<L>As if thy Say-so was enough,</L>
<L>And held by Patent <HI>Ipse dixit,</HI></L>
<L>Infamy where you please to fix it.</L>
<L>No Man reputed Loyal was</L>
<L>For his Obedience to the Laws,</L>
<L>And therefore ought to be protected,</L>
<L>But he who did as you directed.</L>
<L><PB N="134" REF="72">Go hang thy self, since <HI>Caesar</HI>'s Due</L>
<L>Is not to be purloin'd by you.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thirdly, You ought to close your Chaps</L>
<L>By your own Hand, because, perhaps,</L>
<L>Transgressions by thee perpetrated</L>
<L>Are with that Subtilty committed,</L>
<L>They cannot come within the reach</L>
<L>Of Laws, or Cognizance of <HI>Ketch;</HI></L>
<L>Yet, if well-weigh'd in their own Nature,</L>
<L>They may be judg'd to merit greater,</L>
<L>And should have Punishment severer,</L>
<L>Than either Felon or Burglarer.</L>
<L>Hence therefore you're oblig'd to be</L>
<L>In Equity <HI>Felo de se.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fourthly, You cannot think it strange</L>
<L>If Times should have a sudden Change:</L>
<L>Nothing (you know) that's violent</L>
<L>In Nature, can be permanent.</L>
<L><HI>Britannia</HI> sore with Wrongs opprest,</L>
<L>Has her Eyes fix'd towards the East,</L>
<L><PB N="135" REF="72">And seems with eagerness from thence</L>
<L>To look for a Deliverance.</L>
<L>Such Revolution will for certain</L>
<L>In no wise meliorate your Fortune.</L>
<L>The Office may your House ensure,</L>
<L>Yet not your Person be secure:</L>
<L>For on so great an Alteration</L>
<L>The Whipping-posts throughout the Nation,</L>
<L>The Rods and Axes, Pill'ry, Gibbet,</L>
<L>Will change their Side too, and distribute</L>
<L>Due Punishments for old Abuses,</L>
<L>On those who put them to wrong Uses.</L>
<L>All this may come to pass, and rotten</L>
<L>Eggs for a little may be gotten.</L>
<L>Rather than (like Sir <HI>Hudibrass</HI>)</L>
<L>With Orange-tawny Slime your Face,</L>
<L>Some bold unlucky Knave should maul,</L>
<L>Truss up your self for good and all.</L>
<L>Which brings me to the Fifth and Last</L>
<L>Motive to make you tie it fast.</L>
<L>(For do but you secure the Knot,</L>
<L>I'll pass my Word the Rope holds out.)</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="136" REF="73">
<L>Fifthly, You can't for shame refuse</L>
<L>To thrust your Head into the Noose,</L>
<L>Because so many of your Followers</L>
<L>At <HI>Tyburn</HI> have wore Hempen Collars.</L>
<L>Thither your Devilish Doctrines brought them,</L>
<L>Meerly for doing as you taught them:</L>
<L>Your self the Procatarctic Cause</L>
<L>Of their transgressing of the Laws.</L>
<L>Your <HI>Will i' Wisp</HI> was their Undoing,</L>
<L>And led the Wretches to their Ruine.</L>
<L>Therefore what I advise you, do Man:</L>
<L>You know 'twas usual with the <HI>Roman;</HI></L>
<L>Who when he found himself in trouble,</L>
<L>Esteem'd the Practice Brave and Noble</L>
<L>Himself by Ponyard to dispatch:</L>
<L>Why not as Brave, by Rope to stretch?</L>
<L>Why should the Rope be reckon'd meaner?</L>
<L>When Sons and Brothers o' th' <HI>Grand Seignior</HI></L>
<L>Repute it no ignoble thing</L>
<L>To have Death giv'n them by a String.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="137" REF="73">
<L>For Use then, <HI>Quae cum ita sint,</HI></L>
<L>You'll hang your self, I'm confident.</L>
