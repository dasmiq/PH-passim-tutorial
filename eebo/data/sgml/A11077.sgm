<HEAD>To my Countrie.</HEAD>
<P>_BRethren, my hearts
desire for this our
Israel, is, that it
may be saued: Saued tem|porally,
saued eternally.
And from the abundance
of this desire in my heart,
my mouth speaketh. True
it is, that I am not willing
to encrease the vnnecessary
burthen of words, vnder
which the world groneth;
<PB REF="3">
yet therefore necessarie
words may not be retained.
And as I said in the for|mer,
so may I not say yet
in this latter, Is there not
a cause? Is there not yet a
cause to take more physick,
as long as there are yet
more diseases? Neuerthe|lesse,
these are thrifty ad|ditions,
both in measure &amp;
manner. That is added
which seemeth to bee neces|sary;
and where things are
already done, men are di|rected
to fetch new health
out of old Medicines. But
indeed a Medicine should
not be accounted old as our
<PB REF="3">
Fashionists terme oldnesse,
as long as new health is to
be gotten out of it. In bo|dily
sicknesse, a man will
not loathe a Medicine that
can cure him, because hee
knowes it: much lesse will
hee auoide to bee throughly
recouered by it, because in
part thereby hee hath beene
already recouered. And
least of all should any man
thinke, that the reading of
a Receipt without the ta|king
of it, is able to cure
him. This were to vse it
for a Charme, and not for
a Medicine. Yet the fashi|on
of men now a dayes, is in
<PB REF="4">
these kindes most vnreaso|nable,
and most lamentably
to their owne losse: For
they reade things profita|ble,
only for pleasure; and
so being content with a va|nishing
shadow; they wil|lingly
lose a solid and sub|stantiall
good. The plea|sure
of newnesse, or some
handsome shape, wherein
wholsome matter doth ap|peare,
is the tentation of
their reading. But this is
the very folly of children,
who loue to play with guil|ded
Pills, because they are
guilded, but will not take
them as Pills, or meanes of
<PB REF="4">
health. Surely, I wish that
these men who professe
to hate oldnesse, would
hate this fashion; for it is
an old one, euen as old, as
the captiuity of Israel.
<HI>Thou art vnto them as
a very louely Song of
one that hath a pleasant
voyce,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezek. 33. 32.</NOTE> <HI>and can play well
on an Instrument; for
they heare thy words,
but they doe them not.</HI>
But though this wanton|nesse
may fall out in health,
yet it ill becomes sicknesse.
Wherefore let men consi|der
whether they haue any
griefe, or not; and if they
<PB REF="5">
haue, let them leaue their
playing with physicke, and
fall to taking of it. Espe|cally
physicke, which is so
confirmed by proofe, that
of all those that haue taken
it soundly, none did euer
perish.</P>

<HEAD>THE ONLY
REMEDIE.</HEAD>
<P>_AFTER a terrible
Tempest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. The neglect of premoniti|ons makes vs to fall into iudge|ments.</NOTE> a dark
and discomfor|table
Storme,
wherein neither
Sunne, nor Starres appeared,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 27.</NOTE>
<HI>Paul</HI> stood forth, and said,
Sirs, you should haue heark|ned
to me, and so haue saued
this harme and losse. After
many darke and discomfor|table
<PB N="2" REF="6">
Stormes, I may likewise
say, you should haue harke|ned
to the Word of God
spoken by the seruants of
God, and then no doubt
much losse and harme had
been saued. There hath been
Counsell heretofore giuen,
to make vse of old Chastise|ments
by Repentance, that so
the neede of New might be
saued. I will instance in one
particular application of this
Counsell, for the preuenting
of the New Pestilence by
making vse of the Old, a yeer
or two before the New came.
And that I may be sure to
make a right relation of it, I
will here insert the wordes
wherin it was deliuered. <HI>The
punishment which I spake of,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Oyle of Scorp. Sect. 2.</NOTE> <HI>is
the Pestilence which almost de|uoured
<PB N="3" REF="6">
our chiefest Citie, and
with the Sickenes of the Head,
the Body of this Land was also
distempered. I doubt not but
some that haue forgotten it,
will bee almost angry to haue it
remembred; but it were better
to haue a profitable remem|brance
of the same Plague, than
to haue a reuengefull remem|brance
by another. It is the for|getfulnesse
of Gods old Cha|stisements
that makes vs so
soone to haue need of new ones,</HI>
&amp;c. If this Counsell had bin
followed, I verily beleeue,
the Old might haue beene
a preseruatiue against the
New, and God hauing attai|ned
his End by the former,
hee would haue saued the lat|ter.
And if we consider how
it was staied, wee may well
<PB N="4" REF="7">
thinke, that the same Repen|tance
and Humiliation may
preuent a Plague, which can
stop it when it is come. But
this is the miserie, that
though nothing in the world
is more weighty than the
word of God, and those ad|monitions
which are raised
from that word, yet there is
nothing in the world more
lightly esteemed, by sensual,
carnall and foolish mankind.
Yea the folly of mankinde,
which sets her owne colours
on the wisedome of God,
makes such monitions to
look like folly: and so <HI>Lot</HI>
telling his sonnes in law of
the iudgement of God ready
to light on Sodome for her
sinnes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 19. 14</NOTE> seemed vnto them as
one that mocked. Yet it is
<PB N="5" REF="7">
most true, that the word of
God is Fire, and Sinners are
but Stubble: and as a man of
Stubble should feare the
breath of a Furnace, so and
much more should a Sinner
feare the word of GODS
mouth when it pronounceth
iudgements against him; For
our God is a consuming Fire:
But because this feare is too
farre from vs, therfore Iudg|ment
laies hold on vs, yea
Iudgement vpon Iudgement,
that so the Lessons may bee
beaten into vs by feeling,
which we will not learne by
hearing: Because we are like
the deafe Fishes, that moue
not for any voyce, but onely
leape when they are in the
net of GODS Iudgements,
therfore Gods wrath is not
<PB N="6" REF="8">
turned away, but his hand is
stretched out still.</P>
<P>But though the counsell of
God, hath beene heretofore
neglected, and wee haue bin
too carelesse of warnings, to
our losse and harme; yet euen
by these losses let vs learne
to bee more carefull hereaf|ter.
By the chastisments of
Gods wrath that are past, let
vs learne to flie from the
vengeance to come. So shall
a light arise to vs in the midst
of darknesse, yea the darke|nesse
it selfe shall become to
vs a meanes of light, while
by chastisements wee learne
that which freeth vs from
chastisements. So shall the
words and warnings of God
sent by his Messengers, bee
turned to our health and
<PB N="7" REF="8">
safetie, whereas being despi|sed
they adde more to our
sinnes, and so to our punish|ments.
For where Gods
word doth not quicken, there
it doth kill; being still either
a quickening word, or a kil|ling
letter. And as fire, that
which it doth not purifie by
melting, it doth commonly
consume by burning; so the
word of God, whom it doth
not clense by melting in Re|pentance,
it doth lay hold on
to fret and consume vnto ru|ine
and destruction.</P>
<P>2. But if we hearken to the
warnings of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gods great goodnesse is to bee obserned, which co~|monly sends war|nings be|fore iudge|ments.</NOTE> besides the
benefite of present safetie,
God will continue to giue vs
such warnings, and so conti|nue
our safetie. For such is
the great goodnesse of God,
<PB N="8" REF="9">
towards them to whom this
goodnes is precious, that he
is slow to anger, and his an|ger
goes on slowly to pu|nishment;
and commonly
betweene the wrath and the
punishment, there are cer|taine
forewarnings, that so
the wrath may be stayed, and
the punishment preuented.
How often would hee haue
gathered Israel vnder his
wings, as a Henne gathereth
her chickens?<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Chron. 36. 15.</NOTE> <HI>The Lord God
of their Fathers sent to them
by his messengers, rising vp be|times
and sending them, be|cause
hee had compassion on his
people.</HI> Neither hath he com|passion
on that people only,
but in this point of good|nesse,
God who is a God of
the Iewes, is a God of the
<PB N="10" REF="9">
Gentiles also. To the Nini|uites
a Prophet was sent to
giue them notice of a destru|ction
approching toward
them. And <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI>
being yet a man, was fore|told
of his being a beast, that
hee might breake off his sins
by righteousnesse, and his
iniquities by mercy. Neither
hath he left these parts of the
world, without testimonies
of his goodnesse; for euen
the ends of the earth haue
seene the saluation of God.
Surely the men of this Nati|on
haue Prophets of their
owne, that haue spoken to
them, in the word of the
Lord, and from thence haue
both piped forth the mercies
of God, and mourned forth
his iudgements. And if wee
<PB N="10" REF="10">
looke vp to former Ages,
and beleeue the Records
which wee reade of those
times, we may reade of <HI>Gil|das,</HI>
that forewarned the Brit|tons
of their destruction by
the Saxons. And I haue here|tofore
remembred that Re|cord
which speaketh of a
man of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hunting|don. lib. 6. <HI>in oyle of Scorp.</HI></NOTE> that named the
sinnes of the Saxons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">pag. 73.</NOTE> or Eng|lish,
for which they should be
punished. And if wee looke
abroad, euen before this
great desolation of Germa|ny,
wee may finde a premo|nition
giuen to that Nation.
The noble and learned <HI>Ca|merarius&punc;</HI>
in his Historicall
Meditations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 5.</NOTE> hath a chapter
vnder this title,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap. 14.</NOTE> <HI>Of Drunken|nesse
and the euils that come
thereby.</HI> This chapter he be|gins
<PB N="11" REF="10">
with the loathsome sto|ry
of a Gentleman neere
Norimberg, who at his mar|riage,
caused a prize of Drun|kennesse
to bee played. For
hee propounded a reward,
for him that could best de|serue
that Woe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Esa. 5. 22.</NOTE> which is de|nounced
against them that
are mighty to drinke wine.
And these wages of iniquity
were wonne by one that
dranke the sixth part of a
Pipe of wine. Hereupon hee
inferreth, <HI>Such detestable, and
drunken trickes are not to bee
tolerated in a well-gouerned
State or Kingdome, much lesse
among those that are called
Christians: and it is greatly to
bee feared, they will draw
downe a sudden destruction vp|on
Germany.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11">
Behold their sinne pointed
out to them, and a iudgement
attending at the heeles of
their sinne. And O that they
had known the things which
belong to their peace, &amp; that
their sinne had not beene so
rooted in the people, that the
people it selfe must be roo|ted
vp, to pull vp that sin by
the rootes. For so stands the
case, when the people &amp; the
sinne are so knit together that
the one will not part from
the other. Though Israel had
sinned, yet Iudah should not
haue transgressed. Though
the ignorance of Poperie
might haue fostered such a
sin;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Thess. 5. 7</NOTE> for,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 13. 13.</NOTE> <HI>they that are drunke,
are drunke in the night:</HI> yet
the light of the Gospell
should haue shamed it out of
<PB N="13" REF="11">
sight: for they that walke in
the day, should walk decent|ly;
not as fooles, but wisely.
And as no man that doth e|uill
commeth to the light, so
no man that commeth to the
light should do euill, because
the light discouereth and re|proueth
his euill: And how
can the Light look vpon this
euill, but it must needes re|proue
it? An euill to which
the Gospell of Light is most
contrarie, as the increasing
of light is to the diminishing
of light; as the lifting vp of
a man into the station of
Saints and Angels, is to the
debasing of a man below the
state of brutish beasts. A state
wherein a man is neyther
good for God, for the Com|mon-wealth,
for his family,
<PB N="14" REF="12">
for his soule, for this world;
but only for hell. But if there
bee yet anie of those beasts,
that after the Lion hath roa|red
in the Thunder of warre,
are not yet affraid to conti|nue
in this sinne, I pray God
to awake them by his spirit,
which only openeth the eare
to heare, what God speaketh
to the Churches, in the Lan|guage
of his Chastisements.
And being awaked, I pray
that they may take this sinne
for which this great Tem|pest
is vpon them, and cast it
into the Sea: For then the
storme may cease, and the
Guilt of sinne, with the sin
it selfe, may be buried in the
Sea.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Micah. 7. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter">8.</NOTE> <HI>For God retaineth not his
Anger for euer, because hee de|lighteth
in Mercy. Hee will
<PB N="15" REF="12">
turne againe, and haue com|passion
on them: Hee will sub|due
their Iniquities and cast all
their sinnes into the Depths of
the Sea.</HI></P>
<P>And now to shut vp this
point of Gods mercifull Dis|pensation,
in forewarning
men of Euils to come; It is
so manifest, that they who
searce acknowledge the
cause, yet confesse the effect.
The great Achitophell of
these latter times, that makes
little oddes betweene God
and Nature, Intelligences &amp;
Angels, Southsayers and
Saints, yet hee acknowledge|eth,
that by-Saints as well as
by Soothsayers, such war|nings
are giuen. And when
you heare him speake, ima|gine
you heard the Diuell
<PB N="16" REF="13">
confessing Christ. His words
are these:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Discourse vpon</HI> T. Liuy, lib. 1. cap. 56.</NOTE> <HI>I know not whence
it commeth, but it is euident+ly seene, both in ancient and
moderne stories, that there ne|uer
commeth destruction, deso+lation,
or any other grieuous
Harme, vpon a City or Coun+trie,
but there are ( ) holy Per|sonages
to whom it is reuealed
long before.</HI></P>
<P>3. But if it bee replyed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iudge|ments pe|remptori|ly fore|told, yet doe not still pe|remptori|ly binde.</NOTE>
That forewarnings of iudge+ments
if they bee true, they
are of little vse, because they
are sure to come to passe, and
so a man gains but the longer
knowledge of his Miserie, by
knowing it before it come.
To this I might answer, That
a wise Man doth thereby ra|ther
increase his Fortitude,
than his Sorrow: yea by the
<PB N="17" REF="13">
increase of inward strength,
hee diminisheth his sorrow.
For the soule being strongly
resolued before hand to suf|fer
what will certainly come,
shee putteth on patience, and
patience putteth off sorrow.
But I say rather, that those
fore-warnings which are
sent by God, though see|ming
to shut vp a Nation
round about with a wall of
Brasse, yet haue they general|ly
a secret Doore &amp; Issue for
those that are shut vp. With
how many prophecies were
the Iewes hedged in, and by
how many Prophets? yet e|uen
at the last cast, when the
sword was whetting, and rea|die
to strike, a Doore was o|pened
to them: <HI>Amend your
wayes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ierem. 26. 13.</NOTE> <HI>and your doings, and o|bey
<PB N="18" REF="14">
the voyce of the Lord your
God, and the Lord will repent
him of the euill, that hee hath
pronounced against you.</HI> What
could bee more peremptorie
than the prophesie of <HI>Ionah</HI>
against the Niniuites? A day
was prefixed, which stood
before them and seemed to
inclose them, that they
should neuer goe beyond it.
Yet their faith had espyed
this doore of Mercy, as it
were by a little Crany;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ionah 3. 9.</NOTE> <HI>Who
can tell, if God will turne and
repent, and turne away from
his fierce anger that wee perish
not?</HI> Behold a strange Faith,
that so much beleeued in
Gods mercy, that it seemed
to doubt of his truth. Nay,
far bee that from so excellent
a Faith. They beleeued both
<PB N="19" REF="14">
the Truth and Mercy of
God; for they so much be|leeued
and hoped in his Mer|cy
to penitent sinners, that
they beleeued that the same
Mercy had left some secret
way of Truth by which it
might passe vnto them, and
they goe forth vnto it. And
in this point their faith see|med
to exceed the faith of
the Prophet: For the Pro|phet
thought his owne ho|nour
would bee lost, if so pe|remptorie
a sentence were
not peremptorily perfor|med:
But these men beleeued
it stood well with the ho|nour
of God, that a peremp|tory
sentence vpon penitence
might be dissolued. And in|deede,
theirs was true faith,
and his thought was but an
<PB N="20" REF="15">
errour. For the word of God,
whose Truth is a true ground
of Faith, is the very founda|tion
of that which they be|leeued:
<HI>At what instant,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ier. 18. 7.</NOTE> <HI>I
shall speake of a Nation, and
concerning a Kingdome, to
plucke vp and to pull downe,
and to destroy it: if that Nati|on
against whom I haue pro|nounced,
turne from their Euill,
I will repent of the euill that I
thought to doe vnto them.</HI>
Thus we see in the denuncia|tion
of Gods Iudgements,
there is an implied Reserua|tion,
and this Reseruation is
the Doore at which the Ni|neuites,
and other beleeuing
penitents may finde a way to
escape. Yea, the peremptori|nesse
of the sentence which
seemeth to hedge vs in, may
<PB N="21" REF="15">
be the very meanes, to bring
vs to the way of escaping.
For the peremptorinesse of
a sentence, strikes the sen|tence
strongly, as it were a
spurre into the sides of resty,
and dull flesh and bloud, and
stirs vp mankinde hardly to
labour for that Issue, which
seemes so hard and almost
impossible to be found. And
indeede this finding, God v|sually
proposeth as the scope
of his warning. He tells vs
of Iudgements comming,
that wee may finde the way
to auoid them. If he meant
to destroy, his readiest way
were not to forewarne. It
was <HI>Sauls</HI> case, when he was
neere to the period of Ruine,
<HI>The Lord answered him not,
neither by dreames,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Sam. 28 6.</NOTE> <HI>nor by v|rim
<PB N="22" REF="16">
nor by Prophets.</HI> Let vs
therefore account premoni|tions
to bee Summons vnto
Iudgement, but yet by a si|lent
and implied Reseruation,
offering vs Mercie: And be|tweene
the time of denunci|ation
and full performance,
let vs thinke that offer conti|nued
to vs. For the Time of
warning is commonly a time
of Truce betweene God and
Man, and a time of Respite
between Wrath and Punish|ment.
Therefore is it called
The day of a person, or peo|ple,
euen a day of Grace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 19. 42</NOTE>
wherin iudgement is suspen|ded,
and may bee preuented.
And if in this their day, those
things are not hid from their
eies, which may make their
peace with God, the peace of
<PB N="23" REF="16">
God will preserue them,
from the Iudgements of
God. Wherefore let vs not
thinke that euery forewar|ning
is a binding; for a pre|diction
ordinarily bindeth
no farther than mens impeni
tence bindeth it. For in it
selfe, a premonition is an of|fer
of loosing, as well as a
sentence of binding. There
is a gate of Mercy in it, and
man hath a Key wherewith
to open it. Yea the Iudge
himselfe, who seemes to in|close
vs in prison, calls vpon
vs to make vse of it, and by
the hardnesse and difficultie
of escaping, stirs and spurs
vs vp to an earnest seeking of
the meanes of our Freedom.</P>
<P>4. If any man aske what is
the Key, by which this gate
<PB N="24" REF="17">
is opened;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spirituall helpes are the true helpes, to set vs at li|berty from Iudge|ments. 1. <HI>Sam.</HI> 10. 27.</NOTE> he may plainly see
it in the places alledged: In
euery one of them it is Re|penting,
and Turning from
euill waies. But flesh and
bloud replies in the language
of <HI>Belial;</HI> For as the men of
<HI>Belial</HI> said of the King whom
God had annointed, Shall
this man saue vs? So flesh and
bloud saith of the meanes
which God hath sanctified,
Shal such an ayerie and inui|sible
thing saue vs? Yet most
true it is that inuisible things
must saue vs, or wee cannot
bee saued. Spirituall things
are inuisible, and spirituall
things must saue vs. And no
wonder, for spirituall things
worke our eternal saluation:
and if they can worke the
greater, why should they not
<PB N="25" REF="17">
be able to worke out the les|ser
saluation? When a que|stion
is made concerning the
great Saluation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 2. 37. 38.</NOTE> <HI>Men and
Brethren, what shall we doe to
be saued?</HI> The first word of
the Answer, is, <HI>Repent.</HI> And
why should not the same an|swer
serue for a lesser salua|tion?
Againe, if wee looke
vpon the way wherein wee
came to be bound, wee shall
finde a spirituall way, to bee
our onely way to loosing. If
wee looke to heauen, we shall
finde it is God that bindes vs
there; and God is a spirit.
Now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 4. 24.</NOTE> according to the rea|son
of CHRIST himselfe, if
God be a Spirit, it is a spiritu|all
meanes that can only bee
powerfull with a spirit. And
if wee looke below, we shall
<PB N="26" REF="18">
finde it is sin that prouoketh
God to binde man; and sinne
is a spirituall disease, euen a
deprauation of the Image of
God in the soule and spirit of
Man, or a fruit of it. Now it
is plaine, that a spirituall re|medy
can only cure a spiritu|all
disease. The soule will
not bee fed by the food of
the body, neither by bodily
physicke will it bee cured;
Wherfore in regard of God
who is offended, and in re|gard
of thy sinne that hath
offended him, behold the
word of God, turning thee
from carnall, and visible, to
spirituall, and insuisible Re|medies:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Micah. 6. 7</NOTE>
<HI>Will the Lord be plea|sed
with thousands of Rams, or
with ten thousands of Riuers
of Oyle? shall I giue my first-borne
<PB N="27" REF="18">
for my transgression, the
fruite of my body for the sinne
of my soule? Hee hath shewed
thee O man, what is good; and
what doth the Lord require
of thee, but to doe iustly, and to
loue mercy, and to humble thy
selfe in walking with thy God?</HI>
Neither hath God herein
giuen meere words, but his
deeds haue beene as good as
his words. The Scripture is
full of examples, that this
meanes which the world
thinkes to be weaknesse, hath
beene strong vnto manifold
saluations and deliuerances.
Yea the deliuerances haue in
some sort borne the resem|blance
and proportion of the
meanes. A piece of a deliue|rance,
hath followed a piece
of repentance: and such was
<PB N="28" REF="19">
that of <HI>Rehoboam,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Chron. 12. 7. 12. 14.</NOTE> whose heart
was not perfect with the
Lord;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 King. 21. 29.</NOTE> and a temporary deli|uerance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Chron. 15. 8. 15.</NOTE>
a temporary repen|tance,
and such was that of
<HI>Ahab;</HI> and a full deliuerance
a sound and full repentance,
and such was that vnder
<HI>Asa.</HI></P>
<P>5. Wherefore I said to the
foolish,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For spiri|tuall helps are the true helps, yea, they are the helpes of the tem|porall.</NOTE> Deale not foolishly,
and speake not with a stiffe
necke: Say not, <HI>Ashur</HI> shall
saue vs, and wee will flie into
Egypt. Naturall helpes are
like the Egyptians, who are
weake for that very reason
for which thou thinkest them
strong, and the inuisible
meanes are strong for that
very reason for which thou
thinkest them weake. And
herein let God himselfe bee
<PB N="29" REF="19">
iudge betweene vs:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 31. 3.</NOTE> <HI>The E|gyptians
are men, and not God,
and their horses flesh, and not
spirit.</HI> Wherefore behold the
issue; <HI>When the Lord shall
stretch out his hand, both hee
that helpeth shall fall, and hee
that is holpen shall fall downe,
and they all shall faile together.</HI>
Men and horses are things
visible, God and spirits are
things inuisible, and there|fore
doe visible men faile to
helpe, because they are not
equall in power, to the inui|sible
God: and therefore shall
horses faile, because they are
not equall to spirituall and
inuisible strength. Where|fore
henceforth doe thou e|specially
choose those helps
which are spirituall and in|uisible,
because they are
<PB N="30" REF="20">
strongest; and beleeue more
strength to bee in the weak|nesse
of God, (which there|fore
only seemes weaknesse,
because the strength of it is
not perceiued by the fleshly
eye) than in the strength of
man.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 King. 6. 16. 17.</NOTE> And if thou seest not
the spirituall things to bee
strongest, doe not blame
them for weaknesse, but thy
selfe for blindnesse; and pray
to God to open thy eyes, for
then shalt thou see a most
mighty power in them; and
that when spirituall helpes
are on our side, <HI>There are
more with vs, than there are
with them</HI> that haue earthly
and visible helpes. Wherfore
henceforth farre be from vs,
the trust and rest in naturall
things, which is the common
<PB N="31" REF="20">
and first refuge of flesh and
blood when it is pressed with
troubles.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ier. 17. 5.</NOTE> And let those
thoughts &amp; words be loath|some
to vs, which ordinarily
issue from this fleshly blind|nesse
and error. One thinkes,
that Armies can subdue all
enemies, and another that
Parliaments can cure all po|liticke
diseases; a third (and
I wish it had not beene spo|ken
before the late pestilence
in my hearing) that the new
Riuer had washed away the
plague for euer from the Ci|ty.
But I thinke, I need not
to tell them that they are de|ceaued.
And no wonder;
for all outward helpes, are
but the body of helpe, but
spirituall helpes are the soule
of helpe; and as the body
<PB N="32" REF="21">
without the soule is dead, so
all bodily helpes, without
spirituall helpe, are without
life and power. Wherefore
wee must striue by putting
our selues into a right spiri|tuall
estate, to get the fauour
of the Highest spirit, that he
may breathe life into these
dead helpes; and then they
shall haue life and strength as
well as the dead bones, when
he said,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 word"> 37. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> <HI>Come from the foure
windes, O breath, and breathe
vpon these slaine that they may
liue.</HI> This is the true order,
to come by the spirituall
helpes, to the vse of the tem|porall,
to begin with God
and to end with man. In this
case wee must proceed <HI>De|scendendo,</HI>
not <HI>Ascendendo;</HI>
wee must get helpe first from
<PB N="33" REF="21">
the Creator, and then wee
may descend to the vse of
the Creature, but wee must
not begin to seeke helpe of
the Creature, and then thinke
wee may be either confident
or carelesse of the helpe of
the Creator. It is the maine
wisdome, and successe of the
Creature, to goe with the
Creator. He that goes with|out
him, goes without
strength, and he that goes a|gainst
him, runnes against
the rocke of Omnipotence,
and is sure to make most hor|rible
shipwracke. Wherefore
<HI>Moses</HI> saith wisely;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exo. 33. 15.</NOTE> <HI>If thy pre|sence
goe not with mee, carry
vs not vp hence.</HI> There is no
going nor stirring, if God
goe not with vs: But if God
bee with vs, who shall bee
<PB N="34" REF="22">
against vs? If God be with
vs, we may be saued without
Meanes, for God is able to
saue being alone. He can also
raise vp meanes where are
none, and hee can blesse the
Meanes where are some, and
he can make the Meanes of
our destruction to become
the meanes of our preseruati|on.
The last seemeth most
difficult, yet doth hee often
doe it. The Syrians had
brought a most deadly fa|mine
vpon Samaria, so that
the same bowels were fed by
that which receiued life
from them: And by the same
Syrians Samaria was so deli|uered
from the famine, and
stored with plenty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 King. 6. 7.</NOTE> <HI>that a
Measure of fine floure was
sold for a shekell.</HI> The same
<PB N="35" REF="22">
Egyptians which kept Israel
in a most cruell bondage,
were made to bee the men
that should bee vrgent vpon
Israel to haste away out of
bondage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 12. 33. &amp;c.</NOTE> yea, they suffered
them not to goe empty, but
spoyled themselues, to en|rich
those whom they had
spoyled. Euen Death it selfe,
which the Diuell intended
to haue made a Gate to eter|nall
destruction; the out|stretched
arme of God hath
made a gate to eternall salua|tion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reu. 14. 19</NOTE>
So that <HI>a voyce is heard
from heauen saying, Write,
Blessed are they that dye in the
Lord.</HI> Now if God be so ab|solute
a Lord of all things,
that of contraries he can pro|duce
contraries, we may see
that hee hath taken all trust
<PB N="36" REF="23">
from the creature, and reser|ued
it to himselfe; and that
the power which is in the
Creature, being giuen it by
him, can at his pleasure bee
taken away from it, and a
contrary power put into it.
Theeefore our eyes are to be
fixed on God, and to looke
vp first to him, to see whether
he will suffer the Creature to
retaine the power of Helpe,
which hee hath giuen it; yea
and when helpes faile, to see
whether hee will raise vp
helpes, yea farther, whether
he will helpe without helpes,
and yet farthest of all, whe|ther
he will turne our hinde|rances
and punishments into
helpes. And thus depending
on God, and laying the foun|dation
of our hope &amp; help, in
<PB N="37" REF="23">
the name of the Lord, we may
safely and comfortably vse
the meanes which hee giueth
vs. And if hee giue meanes,
with a blessing put vnto
them, they may be of abso|lute
necessitie, when they
haue receiued such blessing
and power from him. Many
points of this doctrine are to
bee found in the voyage of
<HI>Paul.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 27.</NOTE> Naturall helpes can do
nothing without God; so the
Mariners could not saue
<HI>Pauls</HI> company: for they are
lost in regard of Naturall
helpes, whom God of his
meere grace bestoweth vpon
<HI>Paul.</HI> Yea naturall helpes, be|ing
opposed against spiritu|all,
are ready helpes to de|struction;
so the Master and
owner of the ship being be|leeued
<PB N="38" REF="24">
against <HI>Paul,</HI> become
the meanes of the ships de|struction.
Naturall helpes, if
they bee not stayed and held
by spirituall helpes, will then
runne away from vs, when
we haue most need of them:
so the Mariners would haue
run away, when they might
haue stood most in steed, if
<HI>Paul</HI> had not stayed them.
Spirituall helpes, are they
that saue vs when naturall
helpes doe faile vs; so the
loue of God to <HI>Paul</HI> saued
both him and his compani|ons,
when they were desti|tute
of the helpe of man.
And lastly, when spirituall
helpe and blessing is giuen to
the meanes, then the meanes
can saue vs, yea then the
meanes are so necessarie, that
<PB N="39" REF="24">
without them we cannot bee
saued. So when God is plea|sed
to giue successe to the
seruice and helpe of the Ma|riners,
then they are vsefull
to bring the ship where the
passengers may bee saued;
Yea they are then so necessa|rie,
that without the Mari|ners,
they cannot bee saued.
Thus wee see that spirituall
helpes, are the strong hel|pers,
and outward helpes are
themselues holpen by them.
Spirituall helps are the foun|dation,
and temporall helpes
are a building vpon that
foundation. Wherefore if we
will be wife builders, first let
vs bee sure to make the foun|dation
strong, and then may
we hopefully reare vp the
walls. Let vs by penitence
<PB N="40" REF="25">
draw neere vnto God our
Rocke, and being spirituall,
fetch strength and helpe
from the Almighty Spirit.
Then may wee say and not
till then, The Lord is my
strength and my shield, my
heart trusted in him, and I am
helped. Yea he is a Sunne as
well as a shield;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 28. 7.</NOTE> and when
this Sunne returnes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 84. 11.</NOTE> then
there comes a spring vpon a
Nation.</P>
<P>6. Being thus put vpon
spirituall helpes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sure and sound Re|pentance is a sure &amp; sound helpe.</NOTE> and parti|cularly
vpon Repentance, as
vpon that which reconcileth
to vs the strong and All suf|ficient
helper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A first part of it, is the sight and ac|knowledg|ment of sinne.</NOTE> let vs giue all
diligence to make this re|pentance
sure vnto vs. And
sure it is made to vs, by ma|king
it our owne: and it is
<PB N="41" REF="25">
made our owne, when wee
our selues doe practise it. For
then repentance only can
heale vs, when by particular
applying of it to our owne
soules, we make it our repen|tance.
And as it should bee a
sure repentance, so should it
bee a full repentance; For
then is it most sure in it selfe
to heale vs, when it is most
entire and perfect. And so be|ing
sure in it selfe, and sure
to vs, I hope we may be sure
to bee saued. Now to come
to this fulnesse of repen|tance,
let vs view the parts of
it, yea let vs view some Ac|cessions,
and necessary im|prouements
of it, yea let vs
see the Crowne and consum|mation
of it. And let vs not
only see, but doe, that wee
<PB N="42" REF="26">
may bee blessed in the Deede
of it.</P>
<P>The parts of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oyle of Scorp. pag. 219.</NOTE> I haue
heretofore shewed: They
are a Sight and Acknowledg|ment
of Sin, a Detestation
of Sin, and, a Turning from
Sinne to the contrary Righ|teousnes.
And first the Sight
and Acknowledgement of
our sinne is absolutely neces|sary.
It is necessary in respect
of God, and in regard of
our selues. In respect of God
it is necessary; for thereby
we giue the glory that is due
to the Iustice of God: When
we see our sins and acknow|ledge
them, we confesse that
God is iust in his punish|ments,
and that he hath right|ly
afflicted vs.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. 9. 5. 7. 14.</NOTE> <HI>We haue sinned</HI>
(saith <HI>Daniel) and haue done
<PB N="43" REF="26">
wickedly, and haue rebelled, e|uen
by departing from thy pre|cepts
and iudgements.</HI> And
therupon he inferres, <HI>O Lord,
righteousnesse belongeth to
thee, but to vs, Confusion of
Faces, as at this day.</HI> And a
little after; <HI>Therefore hath
the Lord watched vpon the E|uill,
and brought it vpon vs:
for the Lord our God is Righte|ous
in all the workes that hee
doth; for wee obeyed not his
voyce.</HI> Thus from the Ac|knowledgement
of sinne, ari|seth
Glorie to Gods Iustice
in punishing Sinnes; and this
Glorie hee expecteth before
the Sinner be dismissed. Hee
will haue an acceptation of
his punishments, as of things
iustly due vnto vs: and it is
an excellent degree toward
<PB N="44" REF="27">
Mercie, to say with the peni|tent
Thiefe on the Crosse,
<HI>We are righteously here,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 23. 4<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> <HI>and re|ceiue
the reward of our deedes.</HI>
Yea with that holy Man,
<HI>Thou, O God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezra 9. 13.</NOTE> <HI>hast punished vs
beneath our iniquities.</HI> But if
this be the fruite which God
expecteth of his punishments
for sinne, that his Iustice
should be so farre approued,
that the punishments should
bee accepted, how contrary
an effect doe men commonly
returne to God, who in stead
of acceptation returne no|thing
but murmuring and
repining? They employ
their thoughts most on the
stones that are cast at them,
and they bound their imagi|nations
with the euills that
presse them. And they are
<PB N="45" REF="27">
so farre from this right fruite
and vse of them, that they
neither see them as punish|ments
for sinne, neither doe
they see the Iustice of God in
sending these punishments,
yea they doe not see God at
all in them; but (which is
most lamentable, and feare|ful,
because it is the very cha|racter
of the wicked ones)
<HI>God is not in all their thoughts.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 10. 4.</NOTE>
But while thus wee looke
downeward to Effects, with|out
looking vp to Causes,
we look on our punishments,
rather like beasts than men.
And whatsoeuer toile wee
take about the Effects, if wee
doe not remoue the Causes,
it is but losse of labour. But
how can we remoue the Cau|ses,
when we doe not see
<PB N="46" REF="28">
them? Sinne is that which
moues Gods Iustice to pu|nish
vs; and God will haue
his Iustice approued and ac|cepted
in the punishment of
Sinne, before he will remoue
those punishments. And if
it be our owne sinne, and the
Iustice of God, that lay these
euils vpon vs, I wonder what
good thou dost toward the
cure of these euils, by biting
the stone that by these is
throwne at thee. For if thou
shouldst bite it to powder, as
long as the Iustice of God
remains vnappeased, because
thy Sin remaines vnacknow|ledged,
the great God of
Iustice, who in Mercie can
turne stones into children of
<HI>Abraham,</HI> in Iustice can turn
any sonnes of <HI>Adam</HI> into
<PB N="47" REF="28">
stones to batter thee. Yea I
will tell thee farther, that as
long as thou standest off from
God, and doest not take no|tice
of him, and much more
while thou standest out a|gainst
God, and only snarlest
at his punishments, he wil de|fend
euen his punishments a|gainst
thee. The punishments
of God, while they are in
Gods businesse, and till they
haue done their errand, are
the seruants of God, &amp; God
will mainetaine them in that
seruice, vntill it bee done.
Therefore whatsoeuer be|come
of <HI>Nebucadnezzar</HI>
when his worke is done, yet
in doing of Gods worke,
God himselfe doth call him,
<HI>My seruant Nebucadnezzar.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ier. 25. 9. &amp; 27. 6. &amp; 43. 10.</NOTE>
And for this very reason,
<PB N="48" REF="29">
when God bids <HI>Shimei</HI> to
curse <HI>Dauid,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Sam. 10.</NOTE> <HI>Dauid</HI> durst not
to meddle with him; for he
knew, he that set him on
worke was to be feared, and
could not be resisted; but as
long as God pleased to em|ploy
<HI>Shimei, Dauid</HI> thought
it fitter to submit himselfe
vnto God, and so to appease
him, than to fly into the face
of his chastisement, before he
was appeased. When a Fa|ther
corrects his sonne for a
fault, if the sonne in stead of
confessing and amending his
fault, and thereby acknow|ledging
the iustnesse of his
correction, doe nothing else
but fly vpon the Rod, and
teare it in pieces, doth not
this increase his fault, and so
increase his punishment?
<PB N="49" REF="29">
Wherefore lift vp thy head,
and looke on thy Chastise|ments,
like a man, and not like
an vnreasonable creature.
Come down by the Causes,
to cure the Effects, hauing in
the Effects beheld the Cau|ses.
When thou seest the
Rod, see withall who hath
appointed it. It is God that
sendeth it:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Amos 3. 6</NOTE> <HI>For is there any. E|uill</HI>
(of punishment) <HI>and the
Lord hath not done it?</HI> And
why are the Euills of punish|ment
laid vpon vs, but be|cause
of our sinnes: <HI>We waite
for light, but behold obscurity;
for brightnesse, but we walke
in darkenesse,</HI> &amp;c. The Cause
is annexed:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 59. 9.</NOTE> <HI>For our Trans|gressions
are multiplied before
thee, and our sinnes testifie a|gainst
vs.</HI> So to take the right
<PB N="50" REF="30">
course, wee must begin with
the first Cause, and take no|tice
thereof; and that is our
Sinne. Therfore it followes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">verse 12.</NOTE>
<HI>Our Transgressions are with
vs, and as for our Iniquities we
know them.</HI> Wee must know
our sinnes, and by acknow|ledgement
of our sinnes, giue
glorie to Gods Iustice in the
punishing of our sinnes. And
when by this Confession
Gods righteous iudgements
are approued and accepted,
this is a right step, and a good
degree of Repentance, to|ward
the abolition both of
sinnes and punishments.</P>
<P>Another reason of seeing
and confessing our sinnes, is
in regard of our selues. For
how shall wee come to loath
and forsake those sins, which
<PB N="51" REF="30">
we doe not know &amp; acknow|ledge?
And if wee doe not
come to forsake them, wee
can neuer come to bee cured
of them, and the euills that
attend them. Therefore <HI>Sa|lomon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pro. 28. 13.</NOTE>
maketh his Cure of
sinnes, to begin in Confessi|on
of sinnes; and so he goeth
on to forsaking, and so to the
finding of Mercie. And sure|ly,
if we did clearly see them,
they would appeare most
loathsome to vs, &amp; we should
plainely finde, that the sight
of sinne is the way to the de|testation
of sinne. But sinne
being a spirituall defect, or
spot, it must bee spiritually
discerned. And for lacke of
this eie, it comes to passe, that
sinne doth not appeare out of
measure sinfull. For if a clear
<PB N="52" REF="31">
spirituall eie, did see the spots
of sinne in the glasse of Gods
Law, it would appeare as
blacke as an Aethiop, and as
loathsome as Leprosie: Yea,
the righteousnesse that hath
but a tainte of it, would
shew like filthy cloutes, and
the soule would hate euen a
garment spotted with the
flesh. But because wee are
darkenesse, therefore all co|lours
are like to vs; for dark|nesse
takes away the diffe|rence,
euen of contraries.
Therefore Laodicca,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reuel. 3. 17.</NOTE> when
one of her miseries is <HI>blinde|nesse,</HI>
she thinkes her self rich
and to haue need of nothing,
though indeede she be mise|rable,
and poore, and naked;
and what is the reason? be|cause
being blinde <HI>she knowes
<PB N="53" REF="31">
it not.</HI> Therefore her way to
finde her owne misery, that
so she may be cured of it, is
to beg of Christ Iesus that
eye-salue, with which her
eyes being anoynted, she may
see. And when she seeth, she
cannot but see her nakednes,
and seeing it, she cannot but
loathe it, and loathing it de|sire
to bee clothed with the
grace and righteousnesse of
God in Christ Iesus.</P>
<P>7. But of the true sight of
sinne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oyl. of <HI>Sc.</HI> 226. A second part of Repen|tance: De|testation of sinne.</NOTE> I haue elsewhere more
fully spoken, and likewise of
the detestation of sinne. Yet
this I adde, That if we cannot
detest sinne <HI>&agrave; priori,</HI> by loo
king it in the face, and seeing
the vgly and hideous shape
of it, yet let vs detest it, <HI>&agrave; po|steriori,</HI>
by seeing, yea by
<PB N="54" REF="32">
feeling the miserable effects
and consequences of it. All
the torments of a distracted<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leuit. 26.</NOTE>
soule,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 28.</NOTE> the racke of the con|science,
the terrours of hell
in the minde; All the disea|ses
of the body, feuers, pe|stilences,
and rottennesse of
the bones; All the fearefull
stormes that light on the
things of this life, lightning
and tempest, cold and fire,
wracke of estates by Sea or
Land, they are some small
resemblances of sinne; the e|uill
of doing, being a little
(though not at full) repre|sented
in the euills of suffe|ring.
If then there be such a
loathing and detestation of
such euills being suffered,
know, that the euils are more
loathsome for which they
<PB N="55" REF="32">
are suffered: for God doth
not goe beyond justice in the
punishment of mankinde,
yea, he is yet farre short of it.
For after all these euils, at|tending
sinne here on earth,
<HI>the Lord shall come in flaming
fire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Thess. 1. 8.</NOTE> <HI>taking vengeance on them
that know not God, and obey
not the Gospell of our Lord Ie|sus
Christ, who shall bee puni|shed
with euerlasting destructi|on.</HI>
Wherefore as deepe as
the loathing and hatred of all
paines and torments, both on
earth, and in hell, doth enter
into thy heart, so deepe let
the detestation of sin enter;
yea a little farther, as an euill
cause deserues some more
hatred, than that euill which
is made by it. And indeed
thou must take notice, that
<PB N="56" REF="33">
this detestation must goe
deepe with thee, euen to the
bottome of thy heart; for it
being the needle which
makes way for conuersion
from sinne, that conuersion
will not come, but where
this detestation hath gone
before. And here should I
come to speake of the true
expressions of this hatred of
sinne, in selfe-reuenge, by
fasting and other exercises
of humiliation: but of these
also I haue already spoken;
only in some other place, I
may haue occasion to speake
of the excellent vse, and po|wer
of fasting, being ioyned
to the substantiall parts of
repentance.</P>
<P>8. And now come wee to<NOTE PLACE="marg">A third part of Re|pentance:</NOTE>
the turning from sinne vnto
<PB N="57" REF="33">
the contrary righteousnesse:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Turning from sinne vnto the contrary Righte|ousnesse.</NOTE>
and I would to God we were
indeed come home vnto it.
For this is the maine worke
of repentance, that sets the
soule, yea all things in ioynt
againe, and makes a full a|greement
between God and
vs; for sinne hauing separa|ted
vs, the wall of this sepa|ration
being drawne downe,
there is entercourse between
God and vs. The Image of
God in vs lookes cheereful|ly
vpon God, whose Image
it is, and God lookes cheer|fully
on this Image, because
it is his. Likenesse breedes
loue, and on the loue of God
attend all blessings, and the
remouing of all curses. And
indeed why should wee not
leaue sinne? what is there in
<PB N="58" REF="34">
it, or with it, that we should
not leaue it and loathe it?
Surely if wee looke neerely
and cleerely vpon sinne, wee
shall see all the reason that
may bee, to cast it from vs,
and vtterly to abhorre it. A|mong
others, let vs consider
the deformity of it (mentio|ned
before) the vanity of it,
and the miserie of it. The
deformity of it should espe|cially
bee looked on, as that
whereby God is offended;
and the offence of God
should chiefly bee regarded.
Surely sinne is an ill-fauou|red
thing: and it cannot bee
otherwise; for it is contrary
to the most absolute pure|nesse,
beauty, and glorie of
the Deity; it crosseth the will
of God, the Rule of righte|ousnesse;
<PB N="59" REF="34">
it crosseth and op|poseth
God who is light, be|cause
it is darknesse; it is a
blot and spot vpon the I|mage
of God; and it cannot
but bee a thing odious and
hatefull to God, to see his
Image and superscription
blotted &amp; defaced; it turnes
men into a generation of Vi|pers,
it makes them rauening
Wolues, it makes them like
the Horse and Mule which
haue no vnderstanding. Yea,
it makes them worse than the
beasts that perish:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay 1. 3.</NOTE> For the
Oxe knoweth his owner, and
the Asse his Masters cribbe;
but Man by sinne casts off
his owner and Master, euen
the high Lord and Master of
the whole Creation, because
the sole and whole Creator
<PB N="60" REF="35">
of it. And what doe we now,
to saue this sinne from death
and destruction, which makes
vs fit for nothing, but the
wrath of God, &amp; the plagues
that attend it? And if we be|hold
the vanity of sinne,
that may make vs weary of
it, and willing to forsake it.
For the maine cause of kee|ping
our sinnes, are certaine
pleasures with which the di|uell
hath bayted them; and
wee so loue this bayte, that
wee take downe the hooke
with it, and by taking it, we
are taken. And indeed if we
could see sinne stripped of
this pleasure, that is, the
hooke without the baite, wee
should both feare and hate it.
And of this men haue some
sight, in the end of pleasures,
<PB N="61" REF="35">
and in the day of sicknesse,
and death. But looke vpon
them now in the very time
of thy health, if thou canst
but bring thy flesh a little on
sleepe, while thy soule is wa|king.
For if thy flesh would
be quiet, while thy soule is
in this contemplation, thou
mightest answer, out of thy
owne knowledge, vnto this
question of the holy Ghost,
<HI>What fruite haue yee of those</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 6. 21.</NOTE>
<HI>things whereof yee are now a|shamed?</HI>
Take all the plea|sures
that are past, &amp; squeese
them with all thy might, and
see what drop of fruite thou
canst wring of them. They
are past and gone, and there
remaines no one iot of them,
but they are perished with
the vsing.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Coloss. 2. 22</NOTE> And as these haue
<PB N="62" REF="36">
dealt with thee that are past,
so shall they serue thee that
are to come. There is no|thing
left of the former, nei|ther
shall there be of the lat|ter,
but they shall be all swal|lowed
vp of one emptinesse
and nothing. But in stead of
the pleasure of sinne which
is vanished, thou maist haue
a sting of sinne that will not
easily vanish; and this meere
naturall reason hath told vs.
<Q><L>Habet omnis hoc voluptas,</L><NOTE PLACE="marg">Boeth:</NOTE>
<L>Stimulis agit fruentes</L>
<L>Apiumque par volantum,</L>
<L>Vbi grata mella fudit,</L>
<L>Fugit, &amp; nimis tenaci,</L>
<L>Ferit icta corda morsis.</L></Q>
And if the pleasure of sinne
vanisheth, and the sting re|maineth,
<PB N="63" REF="36">
how much better is
the labour of righteousnesse,
whose labour vanisheth, but
the comfort and reward of
righteousnesse for euer abi|deth?
But if nothing else, yet
let the miseries of sinnes,
which are so many blowes
of an offended God, beate vs
from sinne. When wee see it
attended with Plague, Fa|mine
and Sword, with Sick|nesse,
Death, and Hell, with
vnsuccesfulnes in Armies &amp;
Nauies, with terrours with|in,
and without, at home, and
abroad, yea, with all the e|uills
of soule, body and e|state;
then let vs hate it, if not
for it selfe, yet for the feare|full
consequences, and fol|lowers
of it. Yea let vs ha|sten
from it, as <HI>Lot</HI> was haste|ned
<PB N="64" REF="37">
out of <HI>Sodom;</HI> for to ha|sten
out of sinne, is to make
haste from fire and brim|stone,
and from all the tor|ments,
that may be inflicted
by an omnipotent wrath.</P>
<P>9. But if we meane through|ly
to leaue sinne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To leaue sinne throughly, we must roote vp sinfulnes.</NOTE> wee must
leaue sinfulnesse; wee must
not plucke off the branches,
but plucke vp the rootes of
it. Wee must not heale sinne
downeward, but vpward; we
must goe to the bottome of
it, and begin to purge and
heale it at the bottome, and
so come forward to make it
whole at the top. If wee pull
vp the roote of it, the bran|ches
will die, but if we do but
breake off the branches of it,
the root will bud againe, and
bring forth both branches
<PB N="65" REF="37">
and fruit. The tree of know|ledge
of good and euill that
brought-in lust to be the law
of our hearts, which is a con|trariety
to the law of God;
must bee pulled vp by the
rootes. And why should it
not? For when this is done,
a man is in no worse case by
it, than <HI>Adam</HI> was in his per|fection,
euen when hee was
happy, and before his vnhap|pinesse.
Yea, thou shalt here|by
free thy selfe from a most
miserable bondage; and so
let thy libertie, as well as the
excellencie of this estate,
moue thee. Thou art now a
slaue to thy lust, euen an E|gyptians
bond-slaue; if it bid
thee goe, thou must goe, if it
bid thee come, thou must
come; and wouldst thou not
<PB N="66" REF="38">
rather choose to be free from
so blinde and base, and impe|rious
a master, to serue the
highest, and most glorious
Creator, euen the true and
liuing God. True it is, that
sinfulnesse is rooted some|what
strongly in thy nature,
but there is a mighty power
that is able to roote it out, e|uen
the same power that first
created Nature, and that can
raise the dead, yea which rai|sed
Iesus Christ.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 1. 19. 20.</NOTE> This migh|ty
power and outstretched
Arme, is that which helpeth
soules in their passage from
Egypt, and giues them safe
conduct into the glorious li|berty
of the sonnes of God.
Wherefore feare not to in|counter
the power of sinne,
and to cast off the yoke of it;
<PB N="67" REF="38">
for thou hast a mightier po|wer
to make good thy free|dome,
euen a power against
which <HI>Pharaoh</HI> &amp; his hostes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Ioh. 4. 4.</NOTE>
the diuell, sinne, and the gates

<HI>leades forth the people
whom hee hath redeemed, and
guideth them in his strength
vnto his holy habitation.</HI></P>
<P>10. Neither must we on|ly
put off sinne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">When sin is put off, righteous|nesse must be put on. <HI>Mat.</HI> 3. 10.</NOTE> but wee must
put on righteousnesse. There
are certaine fruits, which are
worthy or sutable to amend|ment
of life, and these must
bee brought forth. For when
the Axe of Gods iudgements
is laid to the rootes of the
Trees, none but the tree that
beares good fruite, shall e|scape
hewing downe and ca|sting
<PB N="68" REF="39">
into the fire. But the
righteousnesse of outward
workes, is neither true nor
lasting, without a seed and
nature of Righteousnesse.
Therefore to make the fruite
truely and continually good,
the tree must be made good.
For the good tree only bea|reth
good fruit, and ceaseth
not to beare it. Wherefore
as the roote of sinfulnesse
must be pulled vp, so a roote
of Righteousnesse must bee
planted. As the old man must
be put off, the new man must
be put on.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 4. 22. 23.</NOTE> This New man is
borne of the spirit, as the old
man is borne of the flesh.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Joh. 3. 6.</NOTE> <HI>For
that which is borne of the flesh,
is flesh, and that which is borne
of the spirit is spirit.</HI> And if
that which is borne of the

spirit be in vs, then haue wee
in vs a roote of Righteous|nesse.
<HI>For the fruite of the spi|rit
is in all goodnesse,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 5. 6.</NOTE> <HI>and
righteousnesse, and truth.</HI> This
is the roote of the <HI>tree plan|ted

it is dressed, and receiueth
blessing from God.</HI> And in|deed
no wonder if it receiue
blessing from God, and turn
away the curses of God; for
when the hart of man is thus
made good ground, fruitfull
<PB N="70" REF="40">
earth, and a good tree by the
vertue of Gods spirit; the
heart of Man is according to
the Heart of God; And from
this harmonie &amp; agreement,
issue all blessings and bles|sednesse.
There is friendship
betweene God and man,
when <HI>face answereth to face,</HI>
the face of mans soule, to
the face of God, to whose
Image it was first created, and
after the fall it must bee re|newed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 27. 19.</NOTE>
<HI>Then will God delight

vnto all things,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 4. 8.</NOTE> <HI>hauing
promise of the life that now is,
and of that which is to come.</HI>
Now what shall I inferre
hereupon? yea, let God him|selfe
make the inference, by
<PB N="72" REF="41">
his blessed Apostle: <HI>Hauing
therefore these promises,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 7. 1.</NOTE> <HI>deare|ly

<HI>rule, peace shall be vpon them;</HI>
Peace betweene God and vs,

<P>10. Hauing thus put on<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Crown of repen|tance is a Couenant with God.</NOTE>
the glorious and blessed I|mage
of God, in our repen|tance
from dead workes, and
the body of sinne, let vs
crown and consummate this
happy worke with a Coue|nant.
For thus did the ancient
<PB N="73" REF="41">
Conuerts; they bound vp
their Repentance in a Coue|nant,
that entring into a Co|uenant
with God, God
might enter into a Couenant
with them, and so the knot
of Happinesse &amp; Loue might
bee knit and made sure be|tweene
God and Man. The
heart of man is very deceit|full
and backsliding, and it is
not enough to put it into the
way of agreement with
God, but being there, it must
be bound by strong resoluti|ons,
yea those resolutions
haue beene bound with an
oath. And thus our will
binding it selfe to the will of
God, by a settled resolution,
and vow, it continues the
closer and more vnseparable,
since as soone as temptation
<PB N="74" REF="42">
commeth, it dasheth it selfe
in pieces against the Rocke
of this Couenant. The heart
being as it were hardned and
steeled with Resolution, is in
vaine assaulted, and the Bil|low
of temptation flying a|gainst
it, <HI>non frangit, sed fran|gitur,</HI>
the Billow is broken,
but the house or the heart
falls not, because it is become
rocky being firmely built on
the Rocke Christ Iesus. Yea
Sathan seeing the soule set|tled
and resolued to resist
him, flyes away, and remoues
his engines to places and
persons of lesse resistance.
But on the other side, God
seeing the heart bent, and
resolued, and bound, to a
constant seruice of God, hee
meetes it with a constant
<PB N="75" REF="42">
loue, and the kisse of perfect
peace is betweene them. I
might bring forth diuers ex|amples
of Couenants. There
was a Couenant vnder <HI>Mo|ses,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 20. 12.</NOTE>
vnder <HI>Ioshua,</HI> vnder <HI>Iosiah,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iosh. 24.</NOTE>
vnder <HI>Ezra,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezra. 10.</NOTE> but I especially
propose the Couenant of<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 King. 23. 3.</NOTE>
<HI>Asa,</HI> because it was the pat|terne
of a perfect Couenant,
and a happy successe. And
because I wish the later, I
propose the former. This
Couenant is thus described.
There came a Prophet and
spake vnto <HI>Asa,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Chron. 15</NOTE> and all <HI>Iu|dah</HI>
and <HI>Beniamin:</HI> Hee told
them of the miseries of those
which were <HI>without the true
God, a teaching Priest, and
without law: That forsaking
God, they were forsaken of
God: And in those times there
<PB N="76" REF="43">
was no peace to him that went
out, nor to him that came in,
but great vexations were vpon
all the Inhabitants of the
Countries: And Nation was
destroyed of Nation, and Citie
of Citie, for God did vexe them
with all aduersitie.</HI> On the o|ther
side, <HI>The Lord is with
them, while they bee with him,
and if they seeke him, hee will
bee found of them.</HI> Yea being
vexed for their sinnes, <HI>when
in their trouble, they did turne
vnto the Lord God of Israel,
and sought him, hee was found
of them.</HI> Thereupon the Pro|phet
inferreth, <HI>Bee yee strong
therefore, and let not your
hands bee weake, for your
worke shall be rewarded.</HI> And
<HI>Asa</HI> indeed grew strong; for
the Scripture saith, <HI>Hee tooke
<PB N="77" REF="43">
courage and put away the ab|hominable
Idols out of Iudah
and Beniamin; he renewed the
Altar of the Lord,</HI> and offe|red
a great sacrifice to God:
And to binde vp this new
obedience, and to make it
sure by setting a seale to it;
<HI>They entred into a Couenant to
seeke the Lord God of their fa|thers,
with all their heart, and
with all their soule.</HI> This Co|uenant
they binde with a
high penalty; yea, they binde
it farther with an oath. Nei|ther
was this oath taken with
a grudging, and repining
heart, (such as too many of
our hearts be, that are affraid
to bee too farre engaged in
the seruice of God, though
it be to our owne preseruati|on)
but knowing that God
<PB N="78" REF="44">
loueth a cheerefull giuer;
<HI>They sware vnto the Lord
with a loude voice, and with
shouting, and with Trumpets,
and with Cornets.</HI> And when
they had sworne, they were
not sorry they had done a
good deed, (which kinde of
repentance to bee repented
of, is too common among
vs,) But Israel, yea, <HI>all Israel
reioyced at the oath:</HI> and be|hold
the reason; <HI>For they had
sworne with all their heart,
and sought him with their
whole desire.</HI> And now be|hold
the happy successe;
<HI>God was found of them, and he
gaue them rest round about.</HI>
Behold here a path, that
leades to rest. And the men
are named, that haue already
trauailed in this path, and by
<PB N="79" REF="44">
it came vnto rest.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 10. 11.</NOTE> And wher|fore
doth the Scripture so
punctually trace out this
path? but that ages to come
might learne by this exam|ple,
in the same path to come
to the same rest. The same
seeking the Lord with the
whole heart, and binding it
with a Couenant, and bin|ding
the Couenant with an
Oath, or solemne Vow, are
things which may bee done,
and being done, they are fol|lowed
with rest. What re|maines
to bee said, but that
rest stands before vs, and the
way to rest is also open to
vs, and the Spirit encoura|geth
vs by these examples,
and saith; This is the way,
walke in it, and ye shall finde
rest to your soules? If it seem
<PB N="80" REF="45">
heauy to vs, it is because we
doe not seeke God with all
our heart, and our whole de|sire:
for wee see that they
who seeke the Lord with
their whole heart and desire,
reioyce at the Couenant,
yea at an oath vpon the Co|uenant,
at a Bond vpon a
Bond. For they thinke that
all Bonds are little enough to
binde the heart to him,
whom all the heart doth
seeke and desire. If a woman
doe affect a man with all her
heart to make him her Hus|band,
surely she will account
it a very ioy full thing to bee
bound to him by a solemne
Matrimoniall vow. For it is
nothing else but to binde the
heart to him aboue all, whom
the heart doth affect aboue
<PB N="81" REF="45">
all. It is a pleasure to bee
bound to that which wee
loue. Wherefore if we loue
God, we will take a pleasure
to be bound to him, yea wee
will not only cry with the
Spouse, Draw me, but binde
mee to thee,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cant. 1. 4.</NOTE> with cords of
loue, and I will runne after
thee. Neither is it any new
thing to binde our hearts to
God by a Couenant, for it is
but a repeating of the same
Couenant which wee made
in our Baptisme: And it bin|deth
vs already, if wee doe
not renouce our Baptisme,
and so our Christianity. Yea,
the same Couenant wee re|new
and repeate in the Lords
Supper. For the whole work
of Grace working in the
Church Militant, is compre|hended
<PB N="82" REF="46">
and bound vp in a
Couenant, which wee reade
to bee thus summed vp in the
Scripture. God forgiueth
our sinnes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ier. 31. 31</NOTE> and writeth his
Lawes in our hearts by his
Spirite, and so hee becomes
our God, to direct, protect,
and blesse vs, and we become
his people, to serue, loue, and
obey him. This Couenant
wee enter into in Baptisme,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 8. 10.</NOTE>
vndertaking then to bee led
by the Spirit of Regenera|tion,
and not by the Flesh,
the World and the Diuell.
Now the Lords Supper is a
seconding of this Couenant:
Therefore saith our Sauiour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 22. 20</NOTE>
This Cup is the New Testa|ment,
or Couenant (for so
the words are enterchanged,
<HI>Heb.</HI> 8. 8. &amp; 9. 20. &amp; 12. 24.)
<PB N="83" REF="46">
in my bloud. And indeede
because by the frailtie of the
flesh, whose reliques remaine
after Regeneration, though
the Reigne be abolished, wee
often goe aside from the
Rule of the Spirit, (wee goe
aside, I say, as a ship goes aside
and fals off from the rule of
the Needle or Compasse,
though the Compasse be not
cast ouer-boord, neither fall
out of the ship) therfore this
Sacrament is appointed to
bring vs againe into the path
of the New Couenant, the
guilt of those frailties and er|rours
being washed away by
the bloud of Christ, and the
spot by the spirit of Christ.
Which spirit of Christ also
refresheth and reuiueth the
Law of God written in our
<PB N="84" REF="47">
hearts, and strengthens vs to
a more perfect walking and
abiding in this Law. So the
Iudgements of God doe but
call vs to the same Couenant
to which the Sacraments
binde vs: but indeede they
call vs to a more reall perfor|mance
of that Couenant,
which hauing vndertaken in
the Sacraments, yet we haue
failed to performe. <HI>For this
Cause,</HI> saith St. <HI>Paul, many are
weake and sickly among you,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 11. 10.</NOTE>
<HI>&amp; many sleepe.</HI> And the Lord
by his Prophet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ier. 11. 8.</NOTE> <HI>Therefore I
will bring vpon them all the
words of this Couenant, which
I commanded them to doe, and
they did it not.</HI> And if hee,
<HI>That despised Moses Law, died
without mercy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 10. 28.</NOTE> <HI>of how much
sorer punishment suppose yee
<PB N="85" REF="47">
shall he be thought worthy, who
hath troden vnder foote the
Sonne of God, and hath counted
the blood of the Couenant,
wherewith hee was sanctified,
an vnholy thing?</HI> And thus
while iudgements come vp|on
vs for the breath and con|tempt
of our Couenant with
God, the same iudgements
call vs to a Cure by the con|trary,
that is, by renewing
our Couenant againe, and
stedfast keeping it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 11. 31</NOTE> For if
we would thus iudge our
selues, wee should not bee
iudged of the Lord. Behold,
here is life and death set be|fore
vs, and there are exam|ples
of both. The breach of
the Couenant is iudged and
auenged with destruction:
An example of that breach
<PB N="86" REF="48">
and iudgement, are Iudah &amp;
Ierusalem, who besides their
many breaches, after many
renewings, brake one, euen
a little before their Baby lo|nish<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ier. 34. 10. 11. 17. 18.</NOTE>
Captiuitie. The making
of a Couenant with the
whole Heart, is followed
with Rest and Prosperitie:
and an example of that is <HI>A|sa</HI>
with all Iudah and Benia|min.
What shall I say?
Choose life that ye may liue!
Euery ones heart, I thinke,
should say so to it selfe. And
the speech of another should
be preuented or stopped, as
<HI>Elisha</HI> put to silence the chil|dren
of the Prophets: <HI>I
knew it,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 12. 1.</NOTE> <HI>hold you your peace.</HI>
But then I say as <HI>Iacob</HI> to his
sonnes: <HI>Why doe yee looke one
vpon another? I haue heard
<PB N="87" REF="48">
there is Corne in Egypt, get yee
downe thither, and buy for vs
from thence, that wee may liue
and not dye.</HI> Why stand yee
still gazing on Gods chastise|ments
which yee see vpon
your selues and others, and
doe not goe about to cure
them? Our Ioseph, euen
Iesus that deliuers vs from
the wrath to come, whose
coate was dipped in his own
blood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 2. 6. 7. 8.</NOTE> euen the coate of his
Humanitie, wherin the Diui|nitie
was apparrelled like a
Man, yea like a Seruant; He,
euen hee hath prouided the
food of eternal life, to which
all temporall blessings are
annexed by promise: for
those who in this Egypt, this
sinfull land, or world of sin,
doe goe downe to the Vallie
<PB N="88" REF="49">
of Teares, in a full and hear|ty
repentance; what re|maines,
but that with a full
and whole repentance, wee
purchase these temporall and
eternall blessings, that wee
may not die but liue?</P>
<P>11 This full and consum|mate<NOTE PLACE="marg">Profitable and neces|sary Asso|ciates of Repen|tance.</NOTE>
Repentance should be
followed with Inuocation,
or we may rather say, it doth
follow it. For Inuocation
and Prayer is indeede the na|turall
Issue of true Repen|tance.
For sinne being put
away by Repentance, which
stood as a Cloude betweene
God and the soule, and did
hide the Face of God from
the Eyes of the soule, now
the light of Gods counte|nance
shineth on the soule,
and the comfortable beames
<PB N="89" REF="49">
of his fauour doe refresh her.
God doth meete the soule
with a fauourable aspect,
from which, gathering cou|rage
and comfort, shee dares
speake vnto him, and say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 51. 18.</NOTE> <HI>A
broken and a contrite heart,
O God, thou wilt not despise:
Doe good in thy good pleasure
vnto Sion, build thou the walls
of Ierusalem.</HI> When the soule
feeles the weight of sinne a|bated,
and lightned by Re|pentance,
hope of pardon
increaseth, and from hope in|creasing
ariseth confidence,
&amp; then from this confidence
springeth vp prayer. Againe,
when the bodie of sinne is
diminished and brought low
by Repentance, then the new
man flourisheth and prospe|reth.
The flesh and the spirit
<PB N="90" REF="50">
are like two seales, whereof
one being depressed, the o|ther
mounts vp; and now the
flesh being put down by Re|pentance,
the spirit riseth vp
and growes strong; and the
spirit being strong, vttereth
strong cries and grones that
cannot bee expressed. Shee
speakes to God in the very
language of Heauen, which
flesh and blood vnderstands
not; but he knowes the mea|ning
of the spirit, who gaue
the spirit vnto man. There
is an Abba, Father, which no
man knowes but he that hath
it, and he that hath it cannot
expresse it: it is like the ear|ning
of a Lambe, whereby
she owneth her Damme; by
which she owneth her, but
knowes not her selfe where|by
<PB N="91" REF="50">
by she owneth her. There is a
secret earning and owning of
God for a Father, put into
the soule of a sonne of God,
by the Spirit which new-be|getteth
him, and thereby he
calls God Father; and yet not
he, but the very feed and spi|rit
of his Father in him. And
when this call ascends vp vn|to
God, it moueth his bow|els
of compassion: So that
if a mother could forget her
childe, yet God cannot for|get
his sonne.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay 49. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> It is it selfe a
forcible motiue to bring
down blessings, and it makes
way for other preuailing pe|titions;
and therefore Christ
doth set this word of <HI>Father,</HI>
as an head on his absolute
praier, that by it the petitions
following may pierce like an
<PB N="92" REF="51">
arrow, and enter into the
presence and acceptation of
the Almighty. <HI>Wherefore ha|uing
our hearts sprinkled from
an euill Conscience,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 10. 22.</NOTE> <HI>and our bo|dies
washed with pure water,
let vs draw neere with a true
heart in full assurance of faith.</HI>
Hauing repented let vs aske
mercy and forgiuenesse, and
that remission of punish|ments
which followes the
remission of guilt. Yea, if
our hearts bee hard, and can|not
repent as we desire, let vs
aske the grace and spirit of
Repentance. For on the one
side it is condemned in the
Iewes, that they pray not for
Repentance in their punish|ments
for sinne. So saith ho|ly
<HI>Daniel:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. 9. 13. 14.</NOTE> <HI>All this euill is come
vpon vs, yet made wee not our
<PB N="93" REF="51">
Prayer before the Lord our
God, that we might turne from
our iniquities, and vnderstand
thy Truth: Therfore hath the
Lord watched vpon the euill,
and brought it vpon vs.</HI> And
on the other side, it is said,
All things that yee shall aske
in Praier,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 21. 22</NOTE> beleeuing, ye shall
receiue.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 11. 13</NOTE> Yea, <HI>God will giue the
Holy Ghost to them that aske
him.</HI> Pray then for the Spirit
of Compunction and Re|pentance,
of him that hath
promised to giue it, and pray
for the Compunction and
Repentance, when thou hast
the spirit, making this the
burden of thy Psalme, <HI>Turn
vs againe O Lord of Hosts.</HI>
And not onely so, but adde
hereunto,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 80.</NOTE> <HI>Cause thy face to
shine, and wee shall bee saued:</HI>
<PB N="94" REF="52">
that is, pray for Repentance,
and hauing repented, pray
for the fauour of God, and
the Saluation or Deliuerance
which attend it. And indeed
so inseparable is Deliuerance
from Prayer, that if God
doth promise to send a Deli|uerance,
yet he expects that
Prayer should come to fetch
it of him. God had promised
a Deliuerance to the Iewes
from the Captiuitie of Ba|bylon
after seuenty yeeres.
Yet he saith;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ier. 29. 12.</NOTE> <HI>Then shall you
call vpon me, and shall goe and
pray vnto me, and I will hear|ken
vnto you.</HI> And euen vpon
this foundation did <HI>Daniel</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. 9. 2.</NOTE>
build his excellent prayer
vnto God for his Nation.
Wherefore let vs take Gods
owne way which he points
<PB N="95" REF="52">
vnto vs, to come to his owne
Blessings: A way so often
beaten and tried to leade as|suredly
to blessings, and euen
to the blessing of Deliue|rance
from the punishments
of sinne, that the storie of the
Iudges is full of continuall
patternes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Neh. 9. 27. 28.</NOTE> These <HI>Nehemiah</HI>
summeth vp: <HI>When they cried
to thee, thou heardest them
from Heauen, and according to

them Sauiours, who saued
them out of the hand of their
Enemies.</HI> Yea he saith again:
<HI>When they returned and cried
vnto thee, thou heardest them
from Heauen, and many times
didst thou deliuer them, accor|ding
to thy Mercies.</HI> Where|fore
since crying to God is
the way to deliuerance, let
<PB N="96" REF="53">
vs neuer leaue going in this
way vntill we come to De|liuerance.</P>
<P>12 But let vs know withall<NOTE PLACE="marg">To pre|uaile with God, our petitions must aime to Gods glorie. <HI>Psal.</HI> 50. 15</NOTE>
that he which said, <HI>Call vpon
me in the day of trouble and I

also, <HI>And <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 span">glorifie me.</HI>
To glorifie <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 span"> God,
must <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 span"> intended
by vs, when we seeke a Deli|uerance;
and performed by
vs, when wee haue it. Yea,
hauing receiued some deliue|rances
already, let vs bee
thankefull for them, and that
is the way to get more. For
when God hath the fruite of
his Mercies, he will not spare
to sow much, where he reapes
much. First, we must intend
the Glorie of God in the
Praiers which wee make for
<PB N="97" REF="53">
Deliuerance from troubles,
or any other blessing. Yea,
by this very point of Gods
glory, let vs binde and adiure
him: For that is a principall
meanes, by which to preuaile
with God, to make Gods
glory the scope of our pray|ers.
Therefore our Sauiour
who is the wisdome of God,
makes the first petition, of
his perfect prayer, <HI>That Gods
Name may bee hallowed:</HI> For
hee knew, that if in the first
and chiefest place we doc de|sire
Gods glory, all the peti|tions
that come after, and are
in order to this glory, must
needs bee effectuall and po|werfull
with God. And for
this reason, so many prayers
of the Saints, in whom the
Spirit of Christ conformed
<PB N="98" REF="54">
their prayer vnto the prayer
of Christ, doe so often ad|iure
GOD by his great
Name, and for his Names
sake, to grant their petitions.
So <HI>Ioshua</HI> when hee went a|bout
to saue Israel, who was
now ready to bee destroyed,
hee had no mightier Argu|ment,
wherby to binde God
to preserue them, than this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iosh. 7. 9.</NOTE>
<HI>What wilt thou doe to thy great
Name?</HI> And indeed when
you strike on Gods glory
with your petition, you strike
on that which is principall in
the heart of God, and there|fore
principally toucheth &amp;
moueth him. You adiure him
by that which is dearest to
him, euen by that which <HI>is
his owne end;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Esa. 48. 11.</NOTE> and is so parti|cularly
his owne, that he will
<PB N="99" REF="54">
<HI>not giue it to another.</HI> His
wisdome he communicates,
and his iustice he distributes,
and his mercy hee bestowes,
but his glory he will not giue
away:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 1. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter"> 30. 31.</NOTE> for all glorying is ex|cluded,
and hee that glories,
may not glory in his wis|dome,
power, goodnesse, or
any thing else, but hee must
only glory in the Lord. And
iustly is glory most precious
to him, and hee may rightly
challenge it as alone due to
himselfe; for there is no fit
end of God but himselfe.
In all his Creation, in the
worke of redemption, in the
dispensation of his proui|dence,
&amp; all that he doth both
in heauen and earth, God on|ly
is a fit end of God, Gods
glory of the workes of God.
<PB N="100" REF="55">
Hee cannot but end in him|selfe,
what hee begun from
himselfe; neither can he make
a creature his end, whose ve|ry
beginning is from him.
Therefore the Scripture
rightly inferres,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reu. 5. 11.</NOTE> <HI>Thou art
worthy O Lord to receiue glo|ry,
and honour, for thou hast
created all things, and for thy
pleasure they are and were cre|ated.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 11. 36</NOTE>
And, <HI>of him, and through
him, and to him are all things,
to whom bee glory for euer.</HI>
So that as all things are of
God, so all things are to him,
and to him they are by the
glory which ariseth from
them; for this is the maine
fruite, and returne that comes
vnto God from his works. So
that if you come to him this
way, you come to him his
<PB N="101" REF="55">
own way, &amp; he wil walk with
you in this way, vntill you
come to the wayes end.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Amos. 3. 3.</NOTE> <HI>But
can two walke together, except
they be agreed?</HI> If you agree
not with God in your petiti|on,
can you thinke to haue
God to walke with you to
the end of your petition?
If your end be the Creature,
or some perishing vse of it,
and Gods end is himselfe the
Creator, do you thinke God
will leaue his end, to walke
with you to your end? If your
end bee your owne ease, or
pleasure, or safetie, yea the
quiet or safetie of a Coun|trie,
and Gods end bee his
owne glory, exeept you le|uell
your end to his end, and
so indeed make yours cease
to be your end, by making
<PB N="102" REF="56">
his end yours (for there can
be but one vtmost end, which
indeed alone is an end) doe
you thinke your petition can
be pleasing or auailable with
God, while it goes not to the
end proposed by God? Cer|tainly
a Nation is so farre
from being Gods end,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Esa. 40. 18. 22.</NOTE> that
<HI>all the Nations of the earth
are reputed as nothing before
him,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. 4. 35.</NOTE> that is, they are nothing
in comparison of him. When
God lookes vpon Man, and
himselfe together, Man va|nisheth
away into nothing
before him. Therfore <HI>Ioshua,</HI>
when hee will saue his Nati|on,
goes not to moue God
by the way of the Creature,
as by saying, It is a great Na|tion,
it is pitty such a Nation
should be destroyed; but hee
<PB N="103" REF="56">
goes to the Creator by his
owne way, euen by the glo|ry
of the Creator. But the
contrary is the cause why we
so seldome thriue in our pe|titions,
because wee make
man the end of God, and not
God the end of man. Wee
will only make vse of God,
to serue mans turne, and then
it is well enough; but that
man, being holpen, should af|ter
serue Gods turne, we lit|tle
intend. But let vs know,
that this is the only way to
haue our petitions, not only
denyed, but despised: De|spised,
I say, because they
haue such base ends; base in
comparison of that great and
glorious God, who only is
the true end of all his Crea|tures,
and ought to bee so
<PB N="104" REF="57">
proposed, when wee seeke a|ny
thing of him, for the good
of the Creature. But this
maine end being proposed,
euen God and his glory, then
wee may commendably and
hopefully, pray for the good
of the creature, yea we may
binde God in our prayers,
and contest with him for his
owne glory. And this kinde
of petition and prayers are
most forcible with God: for
wee may bee sure God will
not be wanting to himselfe;
his goodnesse, wisdome and
power, shall neuer faile his
creatures, when they may
aduance the creatures to the
glory of the Creator.</P>
<P>13. In a second place I
must say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our peti|tions ha|uing pre|uailed, we must giue God the glory, due for their preuai|ling.</NOTE> it is some encou|ragement
to God to grant
<PB N="105" REF="57">
new petitions, if hee haue
receiued the glory due to
him for granting the old. For
how should hee hope for
more glory of new benefites,
if he haue not that which is
due for the old? That man
deserues not to haue a second
good turne, that is not thank|full
for the first. But if God
haue his end, that is, his glo|ry,
by his benefites past, our
petitions may bee bold with
him for blessings to come;
for God will not sparingly
sow, where hee doth plenti|fully
reape. It was the bar|rennesse
of the tree, that
brought vpon it the fearefull
sentence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 13. 7.</NOTE> <HI>Digge it vp, why
combreth it the ground?</HI> Both
the people and the petitions,
can looke for little other
<PB N="106" REF="58">
end, who hauing receiued
the grant of former petiti|ons,
doe not returne to God
the fruites of glory and
thankes-giuing. Glory and
thanks-giuing are the fat of
our sacrifices, and our petiti|ons
are leane and ill-fauou|red,
like <HI>Pharaohs</HI> latter kine,
that haue not this fat.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Malach. 1.</NOTE> <HI>If yee
offer the blinde and lame and
leane for sacrifice, is it not euill?
offer it now to thy Gouernour,
will he be pleased with thee?
yet I am a great King, saith the
Lord of Hosts.</HI> And indeed
when wee speake to a King,
and desire some grace from
him, it is an vsuall thing to
begin with praise and ac|knowledgement
of former
fauours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 24. &amp; 26.</NOTE> and goodnesse. <HI>Ter|tullus</HI>
did it to lesse than a
<PB N="107" REF="58">
King, and <HI>Paul</HI> was not much
behinde him in the same.
But hee dealt throughly in
this kinde with <HI>Agrippa,</HI> and
so much praised him for be|leeuing
the Scriptures, that
hee almost made him that,
which was the end of his
praise, euen almost a Chri|stian.
Now if God be a great
King, let vs giue him great
praises; hee deserues them,
and wee shall be gainers by
them. For as his greatnesse
is, so is his goodnesse; and he
that is good to vs in great
things, deserues great prai|ses:
And if this debt be paid,
hee will goe on in lending.
<HI>Dauid</HI> knew this, and there|fore
when hee seekes new
helpe in new extremities, hee
begins commonly with prai|ses
<PB N="108" REF="59">
for Gods old and ancient
goodnesse.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 9. 1. 10. 11. &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>I will praise thee
O Lord, with my whole heart;
I will shew forth all thy mar|uailous
workes: They that
know thy Name will put their
trust in thee, for thou Lord hast
not forsaken them that seeke
thee: Sing praises to the Lord
which dwelleth in Sion, declare
among the people his doings.
When hee maketh inquisition
for blood, he remembreth them,
hee forgetteth not the cry of
the humble.</HI> And then comes
prayer, when praise hath
made way for it; <HI>Haue mercy
vpon mee, O Lord, consider my
trouble, which I suffer of
them that hate mee, thou that
liftest mee vp from the gates
of Death.</HI> And both praise
and prayer are followed
<PB N="109" REF="59">
with successe; <HI>The Heathen
are sunke downe in the pit
that they haue made. In the
net which they hid is their
owne foote taken. The Lord is
knowne by the Iudgement
which hee executeth; the wic|ked
is snared in the worke of
his owne hands, &amp;c.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nehem. 9.</NOTE> The Le|uites
also after their returne
from the Captiuity, by prai|sing
God for his old bene|fites,
winde-in their prayer
and petition for new. For
they knew, that Gods eare is
open to due praise and
thanks-giuing; and when it is
open to praise, then also may
prayer enter, the doore of
grace and audience being o|pen.
Behold the summe of
both;<NOTE PLACE="marg">ver. 32.</NOTE> <HI>Now therefore our God,
the great, the mighty, and the
<PB N="110" REF="60">
terrible God, who keepest Coue|nant
and mercy, let not all the
trouble seeme little before thee
that hath come vpon vs.</HI> And
surely if any Nation, this Na|tion
hath a faire way where|by
to come vnto God: For
no Nation hath receiued
greater fauours and more
wonderfull deliuerances; so
that a large doore is open to
them, for their petitions to
enter, if great praise and
thanks-giuing, for
great bles|sings
and deliuerances, bee
(and so it should be) sent be|fore
to make way for them.
Our Deliuerances haue bin
many, and withall so emi|nent,
that the eyes of the
world haue plainly seene the
great power of God in them:
and if others haue taken no|tice
<PB N="111" REF="60">
of them, how much
more should they affect vs,
who haue tasted the sweet|nesse
and benefite of them?
The deliuerance of Eightie
Eight, is a thing wondred at
by the world; and the Dis|couery
of the Powder-Trea|son,
very neere, if not one
with a Miracle. To these we
may adde euen very late and
New Deliuerances, and tur|nings
away of iudgements,
whereof I desire to take a
more full consideration, to|ward
the close of this work;
it being one maine end of it,
to continue the memorie of
Gods goodnesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 107.</NOTE> and of his
wonderfull workes to the
children of men: And not
only the memory, but to
make the memory vsefull,
<PB N="112" REF="61">
by giuing God due glory for
his mercies, and to make vs
the fitter for new mercies, by
a right vse of the old. For
lamentable it is to see, how
soone Gods benefites grow
stale and dead to vs; so that
wee shut vp our owne way,
to new benefites, and to our
prayers that are made for
them, by forgetting the old.
Wee are all for crauing, and
nothing for thanks-giuing,
and therefore our crauing is
not heard, because it comes
without thanks-giuing. Wee
separate that which God by
his blessed Apostle doth so
often ioyne together, prayer
and thanks-giuing.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Thess. 5. 17. 18.</NOTE> Wee are
all for our selues,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 2. 1.</NOTE> and nothing
for God; and therefore it is
no wonder if God doe no|thing
<PB N="113" REF="61">
for vs. We are like the
Horse-leech euer crying,
Giue, giue; yet this giuing
which wee so much desire of
God, we will not allow God
to expect from vs. There is
much oddes between giuing
of benefites and giuing of
thankes; yet we that expect
so much giuing of the grea|ter,
will not affoord the lesser,
yea though it be a ready way
to procure the greater. In
worldly things it is all the
wisdome and indeauour of
Trafficke, by a thing of lesse
price to get a thing of grea|ter
value; only in spirituall
trafficke, and in commerce
with God, wee will not lay
out little things, to obtaine
his great things. But this a|riseth
much from a poyson
<PB N="114" REF="62">
in our nature, which loseth
the taste of things had, and
reacheth out the appetite
strongly to things not attai|ned.
Now the true way
whereby to raise vp and to
continue thankfulnesse, is to
stirre vp and continue the
true and first taste of Gods
benefits. We must haue such
a taste of them, as wee had
when we first receiued them.
Yea we should put our selues
into the same case of danger
or necessity wherein we were
before wee receiued them;
and then consider, how such
a Deliuerance doth taste be|ing
receiued in such a danger.
If thus thou taste the good|nesse
of God in his mercies,
this goodnesse of God will
fill thy soule as with marrow
<PB N="115" REF="62">
and fatnesse, and from thence
will naturally arise a due
eructation of praise and
thanksgiuing. And thus will
be an endlesse Circle of Bles|sings.
The more blessings
God sendeth vs, the more
shall we blesse him; and the
more we blesse him&punc; the more
blessings he will send vs. A|men,
Amen.</P>
<P>Thus the great Helpe of
Miseries hath beene presen|ted
to view, with his Allies,
and Associates. A Helpe
which is able to helpe vs,
without worldly helpes; a
Helpe that helpes worldly
Helpes; and a Helpe with|out
which no other Helpes
will helpe vs. For this Helpe
brings vs to the strong
Helper, and gets him to re|moue
<PB N="116" REF="63">
his owne iudge|ments.
But without this all
Helpes are vanitie, because
<HI>they looke not vnto the Holy
one of Israel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Esa. 31. 1. 2.</NOTE> <HI>neither seeke the

of these euil humours,
is that which lies heauie vp|on

beene discouered by many,
yet few are cured; and some
there are which can scarse be
beaten into the notice of

but abhorre to heare it, and

they take a pride in this mad|nesse.
And wheras a man that
feares God, feares to vse his
Name vainely, though it
were but in the vsuall and
vnnecessary formes of admi|ration;
these men striue to
<PB N="122" REF="66">
fill vp their speeches with
many repetitions of the
Name of God; that they
may often name him, whom
they doe not beleeue to bee
at all: or if they beleeue that
there is a God, their wicked|nesse
is the greater, because
they wittingly dishonour
him, whom they beleeue to
be God. Let such men walke
vnder what name they will,
the name of Heathen is the
least that belongs to them.
For, can they bee other than
Heathens, that doe not so
much as sauour of the Lords
Praier, and the ten Comman|dements?
in one of which
there is a Petition, that Gods
Name may be hallowed, and
in the other a Precept, that
his Name should not be pro|phaned.
<PB N="123" REF="66">
And if there be any
oddes between such Christi|ans
and Heathens, the oddes
of goodnesse is on the Hea|thens
side. For the Heathen
knowes not this Praier, nor
these Commandements; so
that if hee offend, he offends
against that which he knows
not. But these false Christi|ans,
no question, haue known
them, at least in their child|hood,
and so doe offend a|gainst
that which they knew.
Now since Christ hath pro|nounced
a heauier sentence
on these than the other, no
doubt they are worse than
the other: for he saith, The
ignorant Heathens shall bee
beaten with few stripes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 12.</NOTE> and
these with many. But a|gainst
this and many other
<PB N="124" REF="67">
sinnes, there hath sounded
out the Word of God so of|ten
in vaine, that it may euen
now truly bee said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Esa. 65. 2.</NOTE> <HI>All the
day long I haue stretched forth
my hands vnto a disobedient,
and gainsaying people.</HI> Which
giues cause to feare, lest all
the day long GOD also
stretch forth his hand vpon
a disobedient and gainsaying
people. And I wish yet at
length, that though they
haue not taken it to heart
when his hand is stretched
out vnto them, yet they may
lay it to their heart, when his
hand is stretched out vpon
them.</P>
<P>15. The continuing of
these and other roaring sins,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Continu|ance in sin, bindes the sins of the fathers to the children. Of which a great one, is shedding innocent bloud.</NOTE>
with a high, wilfull, and pre|sumptuous
hand, makes mee
<PB N="125" REF="67">
to doubt, that the stocke of
our sinnes, euen of the sins
of this Nation, growes on
to a fulnesse, and that the
sinnes of our Ancestors com|ming
downe vpon vs by a
continuall and vnbroken suc|cession,
the treasure of wrath
growes to a fit and full mea|sure
for a day of wrath. And
if these sins should descend
vpon vs, one of them which
I should especially feare, is
Blood, and especially the
Blood of the Martyrs. For
this sinne stucke fast to Israel,
and followed them, euen
through the daies of good
<HI>Iosiah,</HI> and hath this fearefull
Doome set vpon it, <HI>That God
would not pardon it.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 King. 24. 4.</NOTE> And I
suppose a man may see the
blood of the Martyrs worke
<PB N="126" REF="68">
on some Houses particularly;
&amp; if particularly, why not ge|nerally?
especially there be|ing
such a bending in many,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See oile of Scor. Sect. 10.</NOTE>
to touch with the whore, that
is drunken with the blood of
the Saints. And surely her
touch doth defile those that
are knit to her, with the
blood of the Saints.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cure of this he|reditarie euill.</NOTE> But a
Remedie against this and o|ther
sins of our Forefathers
is giuen by God himselfe:
<HI>If he beget a Son, that seeth all
his Fathers sinnes which hee
hath done,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezek. 18.</NOTE> <HI>and considereth,
and doth not such like, he shall
not dye for the iniquitie of his
Father.</HI> This is the way,
which God himselfe hath
shewed, whereby the sonnes
may put off the guilt and pu|nishment
of their fathers
<PB N="127" REF="68">
sinnes, euen by putting off
the sinnes themselues. But
we must know withall, that
sinnes are neuer throughly
put off, vntill sinfulnesse bee
put off, euen the roote it selfe
of sinne. But when this sin|fulnesse
is put off, then is
there a diuiding and parti|tion
between the Sonne and
the Father, the knife of Cir|cumcision
hauing cut off
that, by which the sinne of
the Fathers was deriued to
the Children. For in Rege|neration,
which putteth off
the old man and the body of
sinne, we are cut off from the
stocke of the first <HI>Adam,</HI> and
graffed into the second <HI>A|dam,</HI>
and from thence our
pedegree is reckoned from
the second, into whom wee
<PB N="128" REF="69">
are ingraffed, and not from
the first, from whom wee are
cut off. We are then beheld
in him, in whom God is wel
pleased, and not in him, in
whom God is offended. Yea
in stead of the guilt of the
sinnes of our Fathers, the
righteousnesse of Christ Ie|sus
descendeth vpon vs; and
we are so farre from the guilt
of those whose corruption
we haue put off, that we are
cloathed with the righteous|nesse
of Him whom we haue
put on. In the very concep|tion
of Christ Iesus, the Ho|ly
Ghost stopped or cut off
this streame of Corruption,
that it should not descend
vpon him; and that not de|scending,
neither did the
guilt of old sins descend vp|on
<PB N="129" REF="69">
him. But what he had in
his Birth, wee haue in our
New-birth, when wee are
New-borne of him: For
then is the guilt of old sins
cut off, the sinfulnesse being
cut off by which it streamed
downe vpon vs.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 10. 17.</NOTE> And thus
doe wee come to the New
Couenant, whereby the
Lawes of God being writ|ten
in our hearts, not onely
the sinnes of our Forefa|thers,
but our owne sinnes,
are put away; for God for|giueth
all iniquities, and re|membreth
sinnes no more.
And indeede to this very
Couenant doth God call vs
in those places of Scripture,
where hee teacheth vs this
way of putting off the sins of
our Fathers. For though he
<PB N="130" REF="70">
begins in the Law, yet hee
ends in the Gospell: And
we know that the Gospell is
generally, though secretly,
intimated in the Law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 3. 24.</NOTE> which
was a Schoolemaster to
Christ. But here samewhat
openly wee are called to the
Gospell and New Coue|nant.
There are two places
wherein God answers the
Iewes that had set vp a Pro|uerbe
against his Iustice.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ier. 31. 29.</NOTE> <HI>The
Fathers haue eaten sower
grapes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezek. 18.</NOTE> <HI>and the childrens teeth
are set on edge.</HI> As if they
should say, Wee are righte|ous,
and haue not eaten the
sower grapes of vnrighte|ousnesse,
but onely by our
Fathers eating, the teeth of
vs their children must be set
on edge. Surely a terrible
<PB N="134" REF="70">
taxe and accusation of the
Equalitie and Iustice of
Gods waies, That righteous
Children should bee puni|shed
for the sinnes of vn|righteous
Parents. Heare the
Force of their Argument,
standing vpon this Assump|tion,
That they were righ|teous:
God ioynes Issue
with them iust in that point,
and tells them plainely, that
if they bee righteous, they
shall not dye, but liue. And
because the Iewes by reason
of the vaile on their eies, still
groped for a Legall Righte|ousnes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 10&punc; 3.</NOTE>
and (as S. <HI>Paul</HI> saith)
<HI>being ignorant of Gods Righte|ousnesse,
goe about to establish
their owne</HI> (that is, a Legall)
<HI>Righteousnesse;</HI> God know|ing
their meaning, talkes
<PB N="132" REF="71">
with them in their own lan|guage,
and accepts their
challenge, in their Legall
termes.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Compare</HI> Ezek. 18. 5. 6. 7. 8 9. 19. <HI>with</HI> Leuit. 18. 4. 5. &amp; Gal. 3. 10. 12.</NOTE> Therefore he vseth
the very words of the Law
when he answers them; set|ting
forth to them a Legall
Righteousnesse, and with
the very Legall condition,
<HI>Doe this, and thou shalt liue.</HI>
But at length, because hee
knew that the Law made
nothing perfect, because it
was weake, and did not
powerfully change the
heart, by the change and re|newing
whereof, sinne with
sinfulnesse, may onely bee
put off, hee remoues their
eies from the Law to the
Gospell. And therefore in
<HI>Ezekiel,</HI> he calls vpon them
for a new heart, and a new
<PB N="133" REF="71">
spirit, without which all their
legall Righteousnesse can
neuer put off the sinnes of
their fathers. And in <HI>Ieremy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ier. 31. 31. &amp;c.</NOTE>
God plainly tells them how
this new Heart is to bee got|ten,
euen by the grace of the
new Couenant, whereby the
lawes of God are written in
our hearts; and the heart be|ing
changed by this grace,
by a blotting out of sinful|nesse,
and writing of holi|nesse,
the guilt of sinnes
passed, both ancient and mo|derne,
are all blotted out al|also;
for GOD forgiueth
their iniquities, and doth no
more remember their sinnes;
for iustification is giuen to|gether
with sanctification, &amp;
where sanctification is not
present, iustification is absent&punc;</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="72">
Wherefore, since God hath
made known to vs this sound
and sufficient remedy, against
the sinnes of our fathers, let
vs take it heartily, and put a|way
the sins and sinfulnesse
of our fathers by putting on
Christ Iesus, in the new and
second birth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 8. 1.</NOTE> For, <HI>there is no
condemnation to them that are
in Christ Iesus:</HI> but in stead of
the guilt descending from
our fathers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 6.</NOTE> the righteous|nesse
of Christ Iesus shall de|scend
vpon vs; for by the o|bedience
of this one, many
shall be made righteous. For
as sinne aboundeth, so grace
superaboundeth; the breadth
of Mercy exceeds the depth
of Iustice: for as Instice goes
down to the third and fourth
generation of them that hate
<PB N="135" REF="72">
God, so Mercie spreades it
selfe abroad vpon thousands
of them that loue God and
keepe his Commandements.
The righteousnesse of one,
if wee be one with that one,
shall bee more auailable to
our Iustification, than the
sinnes of many from whose
sinfulnesse wee are diuided,
shall be powerfull vnto con|demnation.</P>
<P>16. But while we are spea|king
of the sinnes to bee put
off,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A sinne of our Ance|stors made ours, and made worse: the name of it is Glut|tonie.</NOTE> there presents it selfe to
vs another sinne, which also
hath beene the sinne of this
Nation, and withall we may
take notice that it was a sinne
of Sodom. This sinne in the
Scripture goes vnder the
name of Fulnesse of bread,
and in our Language is plain|ly
<PB N="136" REF="73">
called Gluttony. And this
sinne hath beene so proper to
this Nation, that one puts
<HI>Voraces,</HI> for an Epithete of
<HI>Angli,</HI> and another when he
will say he is full euen to the
brim, expresseth it thus, <HI>Si
saoul comme vn Anglois; He
is glutted like an English man.</HI>
It may bee some men out of
naturall Philosophy, will ga|ther
an excuse, that the cold
Climates haue need of more
food, because the heate be|ing
stricken in, and so by vni|on
made stronger, expecteth
more fuell to feed it, and to
draw it away from feeding
on that stocke of naturall
humidity, which is the lampe
of life. But this only pleads
for such a measure, which
preserueth life; but we speake
<PB N="137" REF="73">
of a measure that oppresseth
life: A filthy, and vnreaso|nable,
and vnmeasurable
measure, proceeding of a fil|thy
cause, and going on in
a bruitish way, to a dange|rous
end. The roote of this
sinne which we speake of, is
Concupiscence, and this
Concupiscence hauing con|ceiued,
infects both vs and
our meate, and doth so turne
our table into a snare, that it
changeth wholsome meate
into poyson, euen into the
poyson both of body and
soule. No reason in the
world vseth meate beyond
strength; for euen that allow|ance
which is for delight, if
it goe a degree beyond
strength, and passe on to a
degree of weaknesse by op|pressing
<PB N="138" REF="74">
vs, it is fallen into a
degree of sinne. Therefore
the Wise man, when wisely
hee iudgeth of eating,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccles. 10. 17.</NOTE> he de|scribeth
that to bee the right
vse and limite of eating,
when eating is for strength.
And indeed that fulnesse to
which the lust of eating be|ing
followed doth leade, is a
fulnesse, by which the
strength of the body is so
farre from increasing, that it
is diminished thereby. Life
and strength, like the light of
a Lampe, are not fed, but
quenched, when that which
should feed them doth op|presse
and drown them. And
in that case food is turned to
an end, cleane contrarie to
that end for which it was
made, being made by vs
<PB N="139" REF="74">
an instrument of death,
whereas it was made by
GOD to bee a nourishment
of life. Yea it hurts the soule
also; for, besides the indispo|sition
of the Body, by which
it is vnfit to serue the soule,
&amp; besides the thicke cloudes
and vapours, which ascend
from fulnesse, and cast a mist
about the soule, there is a cer|taine
secret poyson, that by
fulnesse is instilled into the
soule. This God foresaw,
and therefore he forewarned
his people, to fore-arm them
against it. Hee saw such a
mischiefe comming by ful|nesse,
and therefore hee calls
to them, with a Beware;
<HI>When thou shalt haue eaten,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 6. 11. 12.</NOTE>
<HI>and bee full, Beware lest thou
forget the Lord.</HI> Yea hee saw
<PB N="140" REF="75">
that notwithstanding these
forewarnings, it would be so;
And therefore in that song
of <HI>Moses,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 31. 28. 29.</NOTE> which hee was
commanded to speake vnto
Israel, to testifie against them,
concerning the euills that
would bee committed by
them, and should draw euils
vpon them; He foretells this
euill, as the roote of them;
<HI>Hee made him ride on the high</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 32. 13, &amp;c.</NOTE>
<HI>places of the earth, that hee
might eate the increase of the
fieldes, and hee made him to
sucke honie out of the Rocke,
and oyle out of the flinty Rock,
Butter of Kine, &amp;e. and thou
didst drinke the pure bloud of
the Grape. But Iesurun waxed
fat, and kicked, &amp;c. Then hee
forsooke God which made him,
and lightly esteemed the God
<PB N="141" REF="75">
of his saluation.</HI> Therefore
the wise man prayeth only
for conuenient food; fore|seeing
this fearefull effect of
fulnesse, which hee thus ex|presseth,
<HI>Lest I bee full and de|nie
thee.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prou. 30. 9.</NOTE> O wretched and
most vnreasonable conse|quence,
from most gracious
premises. It is God that giues
vs the food, by which we de|nie
him. He giues food to vs,
and wee by the venome of
fulnesse in the vse of this
gift, doe so blinde our owne
eyes, that wee see not the
Giuer. Yea then we see him
least, when wee feele him
most. The gift should leade
thee to the acknowledge|ment
of the Giuer, yea to
<HI>blesse</HI> him, <HI>for the good Land,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 8. 10.</NOTE>
and for the good of the land,
<PB N="142" REF="76">
<HI>which hee hath giuen thee.</HI>
But in stead of blessing him
for his gifts, thou denyest
him, yea by the gifts them|selues
thou deniest him. Yet
if there were no God, then
shouldst thou haue had no
gifts by which to deny him;
but now because there is a
God, there are gifts giuen to
thee, and euen because he is,
therefore thou denyest him.
A senselesse and a horrible
wickednesse, euen a monster
of wickednesse, the very
sight whereof, should bee a|ble
to fright vs away from it.
But what should bee the
reason of this vnreasonable
vice? Surely this I thinke
may be the cause of it: The
lust of Man which Sathan
brought in with the first ea|ting,
<PB N="143" REF="76">
is that law of the mem|bers
and wisdome of the
flesh, which is enmity to
God. For this lust is that
which sets the naturall man,
altogether to boast of his<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psa. 10. 3. 4&punc;</NOTE>
hearts desire, and to put God
out of his thoughts. Now
when this lust is at the high|est,
then is the enmitie with
God at the highest, and then
is God most shut out of the
thoughts of Man. But when
the body is stuffed with ful|nesse,
then is lust at the high|est.
For in our eating there
are two that eate at once. The
body doth eate, and lust doth
eate. And there are two sto|macks,
one of the body, and
a second of lust: and this lat|ter
stomacke holds out, many
times after the former hath
<PB N="144" REF="77">
done. And this fulnesse by
which this latter stomacke is
filled, after the fulnesse of
the first, is that which causeth
the mischiefe whereof wee
complaine. For from it a|riseth
that height of lust,
which despiseth and denyeth
God: yet to this end and
marke doth lust aime in ea|ting,
euen to feede it selfe vp
to that height, which denieth
God. And for this very rea|son,
is moderation exceeding
necessary, that we suffer not
lust to carry vs on to that ful|nesse,
which denieth and for|getteth
God. Yea fasting is
exceeding profitable, and a
true medicine against lust;
for as lust carries vs by ful|nesse&punc;
out of the sight of God;
so fasting brings vs backe a|gaine
<PB N="145" REF="77">
toward him, euen to a
cleere sight of him. Where|fore
it were good that either
of them were in more vse,
as well for their particular
and proper vses, and bene|fites,
as also because being
contrary to the old vices of
our Predecessors, we put off
the guilt of old sinnes, in
putting on contrary vertues.</P>
<P>But because wee haue not
done this voluntarily, it hath
beene done vpon many by
necessitie, &amp; pouertie hath in|forced
an abstinence, where
grace could not perswade it.
Yet is there one other Cure;
but it is as bad as the Disease,
yea it is so farre from a cure,
that it doth adde other disea|ses
to it. And whereas this
vice did formerly march vn|der
<PB N="146" REF="78">
the colours of a vertue,
called Hospitalitie, now it
marcheth vnder the colours
of Pride and Prodigality.
So are three vices brought
together, to offend God by
his owne blessings the more
fully; but let men know that
they are but a threefold
Cord, to draw on iudge|ments
the more vnauoida|bly.
Excesse it selfe is bad e|nough,
and there is no need
to bestow much money to
buy a vice; yet to buy this
vice some sell their estates,
or at least straine beyond
them: and when they haue
done so, they are proud of
it, euen of buying one vice
with another. Thus excesse,
bought with prodigalitie,
bringeth forth pride, and sin
<PB N="147" REF="78">
is heaped vpon sinne, as dish
is heaped vpon dish. For such
is now the Architecture of
excesse&punc; that there are lofty
buildings reared vp of super|fluous
dishes, that what was
made for the stomacke, may
be put into the eye. And so
wheras ancient gluttony did
vsually intend most to please
the lust of the flesh, this is
fitted now to satisfie the lust
of the eye; and not that only,
but also the pride of life.
And thus are all those things
brought together,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Ioh. 2. 15. &amp;c.</NOTE> which are
of the world, and not of the
Father, though it bee said
withall, <HI>They that loue these
things of the world, haue not
the loue of the Father.</HI> Yea
though the world shall passe
away, &amp; the lusts thereof, and
<PB N="148" REF="79">
they onely that doe the will
of the Father, shall abide for
euer. For meates cannot
make men Euerlasting, but
there must be an end, and
perchance the sooner for a|busing
them, and then there
must come an account, euen
for the abuse of them. But
as these offend in an excesse
of quantity, so others offend
in an excesse of quality, and
put as much sinne into a lit|tle
roome, as others doe into
a great. A great summe of
money is contracted into a
single dish, and there is an
ambition, to make vp a great
excesse, in as little a forme as
they may. Thus the shapes
of vices are altered, but vices
are retained, and there must
bee new fashions in sinnes, as
<PB N="149" REF="79">
in clothes. Surely the Na|ture
of these times, doth not
call for these studies, and
without study, this Art of
Excesse cannot mount to
this Height. When God
calleth for pouerty, wee
should not meete him with
prodigalitie; when hee calls
for humilitie, wee should not
meete him with pride; and
when he calls for fasting, we
should not meete him with
excesse of Riot. But let vs
feare the Consequences of
such incongruities, and let
this feare teach vs to auoide
them. Surely the Iudgement
which God himself hath de|nounced
against them is fear|ful;
there wants nothing but
faith to beleeue it, and then
it will appeare as fearefull as
<PB N="150" REF="80">
it is. <HI>In that day did the Lord
of Hosts call to weeping, and to
mourning,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay 22. 12.</NOTE> <HI>and to baldnesse,
and to girding with sack-cloth:
And behold, ioy and gladnesse,
slaying oxen, and killing sheepe,
eating flesh, and drinking wine:
Let vs eate and drinke, for to
morrow wee shall dye. And it
was reuealed in mine eares by
the Lord of Hosts: Surely this
iniquitie shall not bee purged
from you till yee dye.</HI> But to
those that tremble at the
word of God, and conforme
themselues to his will, as in
all things, so in the right vse
of his Creatures; the Scrip|ture
offereth more grace. For
the Grace of God which
bringeth saluation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tit. 2. 11.</NOTE> hath ap|peared,
and teacheth vs, That
those who deny vngodliness
<PB N="151" REF="80">
and worldly lusts, liuing god|ly,
righteously, and soberly
in this present world, they
may comfortably looke for
the blessed hope, and glori|ous
appearing of the great
God, and our Sauiour Iesus
Christ. <HI>For verily there is a re|ward
for the righteous,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 58. 11</NOTE> <HI>verily
there is a God that iudgeth the
earth.</HI></P>
<P>17 But to what purpose<NOTE PLACE="marg">Not onely particular sins, but a generall roote of wickednes is among vs.</NOTE>
doe I seeke to cut off the
branches of particular sinnes
by the sword of the Spirit, as
long as there remaineth a|mong
vs a Roote of gall and
wormewood, that can bring
forth all sinnes at once? For
if we cure sinnes one by one,
and while one is curing many
spring forth, the disease o|uergroweth
the cure. Yea,
<PB N="152" REF="81">
euen that very sinne which
we seeke to cure, after a little
while will breake forth a+gaine,
because the Roote of
it is still aliue. This Roote of
Bitternesse, is a naturall pro|phanenesse,
euen a contempt
of God, and the Truth of
Religion. I say the truth of
Religion; for there may bee
an eye cast toward Religion,
out of custome, or for com|pany,
or for some remaining
impressions of the first Cre|ation,
that may make men to
feare there is a God. But
to loue Religion in the true
shape of it, and because it is
true, this is it that I find farre
banished by this Roote of
Prophanenesse. And though
I much lament it, yet I doe
not greatly wonder at it: for
<PB N="153" REF="81">
I see a Cause of it, and there|in
I see, that while men are
nothing but men, this will be
their fashion. For Religion,
in the Truth of it, must needs
be Spirituall:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 4.</NOTE> for it is the
worship of him who is a Spi|rit,
and therefore cannot bee
pleased by any worship, but
of Spirit and Truth. Now
if Religion bee Spirituall,
how can it bee, but it must
needs be contemned, yea,
hated by men that are car|nall?
For, <HI>the carnall minde
is enmity against God;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 8. 7.</NOTE> and <HI>the
flesh lusteth against the spirit,
and the spirit against the flesh;
and these are contrary the one
to the other.</HI> And from this
Contrariety ariseth that En|mity;
and from that Enmity
ariseth&punc; Persecution, euen
<PB N="154" REF="82">
from the beginning vnto the
end of the world. For this
two fold seed of the flesh and
the spirit hauing the founda|tions
of it laid in Paradise,
the Enmity then also was en|acted
between them. And <HI>as
then</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cal. 4. 29.</NOTE> (I meane as soon as men
were borne) <HI>he that was born
after the flesh, persecuted him
that was borne after the spirit:
so is it now.</HI> Now doth the
flesh despise and oppose spi|rituall
worship, and spirituall
worshippers: which oppo|sition,
so farre as it doth pre|uaile,
so farre doth the gene|rall
roote of sinne preuaile,
and the sins springing from
that roote. And because the
Diuell is the Prince of this
Enmity, hee fitteth weapons
for this warre, wherwith the
<PB N="155" REF="82">
sonnes of the flesh may fight
his battells against the sons
of the spirit. And of all the
weapons which he hath pro|uided
in these last Ages, I
thinke he neuer inuented any
Engine made of words, more
seruiceable to him, than one
which of late hee hath
brought into fashion. For it is
a sharpe-pointed word, dire|cted
to runne into the very
eye of true Religion; it is a
Canon mounted to batter
the very Kingedome of
Christ, to lay wast all holi|nesse
of life, <HI>the fruite and
effect of that Kingedome;</HI> and
this word is then shot off,
when a Saint is called a Puri|tane.<NOTE PLACE="marg">K. <HI>Iames,</HI> in his Pre|face to <HI>Ba|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="2 letters"> Doron.</HI></NOTE>
And though King
IAMES (a King higher than
the Kings of the earth in
<PB N="156" REF="83">
Learning and Iudgement,)
tied the propertie of this
word to Anabaptists &amp; their
Sectaries, it is now diuerted
to Saints, euen to those that
doe not walke in the broad
way of common, and socia|ble
vices, and especially if
they goe somewhat higher
than ciuil and naturall Righ|teousnesse.
If the spirit doe
but shew it selfe in some ex|pression
of a clearer light, or
more heauenly vertue, than
the darkenesse of the flesh
comprehendeth, it is to bee
beaten down, and quenched
with the Title of Purita|isme.
Yet Christ plainely
calleth his Disciples to <HI>excel|lent
things;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 5. 20. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 word">. 16 3. New Tran&punc;</NOTE> and <HI>Dauid</HI> calleth
the Saints, by the Title of
<HI>Excellent:</HI> yea, and for this
<PB N="157" REF="83">
very Reason in them is all
his delight, because they are
Excellent: and for this very
Reason doth the man of flesh
hate and persecute them.
And indeed in this very Ex|cellence,
wherin the spiritual
man exceedes the carnall and
naturall man, stands the glo|ry
of Gods Kingdome of
Grace. For when men doe
those workes which the car|nall
and naturall men doe
not sauour, and therfore doe
them not, then are mens eies
turned away from the men
that doe them, to God the
Author of them; and so see|ing
their good workes to
shine with a light diuine and
supernaturall, they glorifie
the Father in Heauen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 5. 16.</NOTE> which
is the chiefe and first worker
<PB N="158" REF="84">
of them. But against this
glory, and against the power
by which this glory is attai|ned,
and against the king|dome
which standeth in this
power, and against the spi|rit
which sets vp this king|dome
in the hearts of the
Saints, doth the euill spi|rit
make warre; and as
by all other mischieuous
meanes, so by this malici|ous
word of Puritanisme.
And no wonder,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambr. in 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13. 14.</NOTE> for it is this
spirit of Christ, that is the
maine destroyer of the king|dome
of the euill spirit; and
therefore against him is his
greatest malice, and most
fierce opposition. Hee cares
not though there bee thou|sands
in a Nation, that ab|staine
from some particular
<PB N="159" REF="84">
vices, or doe some carnall
workes of ciuill Righteous|nesse;
for his kingdome yet
may stand, and these toge|ther:
But if the Spirit of God
come once to set vp a king|dome
of grace in mens
hearts, this kingdome is set
vp with power, and this po|werfull
kingdome of the spi|rit
hee cannot endure, be|cause
he knows, that by it the
lesser power of his king|dome
must needs goe to
wracke. And then he bestirs
himselfe, and all his policies,
to quench the smoaking flaxe
of this powerfull Grace,
which yet shall neuer bee
quenched, vntill it come vn|to
victorie.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">It is not the mea|ning of the Au|thor to encourage any en|thusiast or hypocriti|call fana|ticke spi|rits, who incur the censure of this name, and from whom carnall men take occasion to reuile &amp; reproch the saints of God. See his Medit: 73. 7.</NOTE></P>
<P>18 But to come to some
Remedies: Let the Diuell
<PB N="160" REF="85">
and his Instruments know,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Remedies against this roote of wicked|nesse.</NOTE>
that in this, as in many other
things, Malice doth out-run
their wit, and so is not led by
it, but leads it: For if the
Diuell could get this spirit of
Grace to forsake the earth,
the fire would soone con|sume
and end it;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iud. 6. 7.</NOTE> And when
the Elements are melted, and
consumed with that fire,
there comes presently ano|ther
fire vnto which the
Deuill is reserued in euer|lasting
chaines vnder dark|nesse.
And if the wicked
ones, his instruments, could
roote out of a Nation, those
who are truly spirituall, sure|ly
they driue thence the ve|ry
Chariots and Horse-men
thereof; and they were then
fit for nothing but for an vt|ter
<PB N="161" REF="85">
destruction. It is no other
piece of policie, than if the
Sodomites should make hast
to turne out <HI>Lot</HI> and his Fa|milie,
that Fire and Brim|stone
may make haste to de|stroy
them. Secondly let
them know, that they know
not that wherof they affirme;
they censure that which they
doe not vnderstand. For
there may bee a holinesse,
which themselues know not;
there may bee a holy Ghost,
though they see or feele
him not, and that holy Ghost
may reueale that truth, giue
that power and heate of Ho|linesse
and Deuotion, which
flesh and blood doth not re|ueale
and giue vnto them.
And if there may bee such
things, what folly is this, to
<PB N="162" REF="86">
speake of that which they
know not, yea what mad|nesse
to condemne it being
vnknowne? Sure I am, they
doe not know, that there are
no such things, and therefore
they doe not know, that they
doe wisely in censuring such
things, which may bee for
ought they know; and if they
be, they are certainly excel|lent,
and most vnworthy of
contempt. Wherefore let
men take heed, that they cast
not vpon themselues, the
title of folly or madnesse,
when they call a Saint a Pu|ritane.
Thirdly, they giue
men occasion to call them
Brownists, I meane those
that thinke them to be of any
Religion. For these men that
thus cast contempt vpon
<PB N="163" REF="86">
purenesse and holinesse, cast
contempt on the Liturgy
and prayers of our Church.
For there wee finde these ex|cellent
and godly Petiti|ons,
<HI>That our liues hereafter
may bee pure and holy:</HI> Yea
for the King himselfe, <HI>That
God-will preserue him in holi|nese
and purenesse of life.</HI>
Now to reuile this, which
the prayers of our Church
pray for, is to reuile the pray|ers
of our Church; and I
thinke hee that doth it, hath
a fauour if hee bee taken for
a Brownist. Fourthly, to de|stroy
and batter this grace of
the Spirit, is the only way to
leaue no good works among
vs, and so to bring the very
name of Reformed religion
into infamy. For the workes
<PB N="164" REF="87">
which were brought forth
by the errors and motiues of
the flesh in the darknesse of
Poperie, we haue sought to
remoue. And now striuing
to set a new roote and prin|ciple
of good workes, euen
Grace the true roote and
fountaine of them, this the
Diuell by these words of
malice and contempt, doth
seeke to roote vp and de|stroy.
So that this is the way
to leaue no roote at all of
good workes. But farre bet|ter
were it to cherish the true
and kindely roote of them,
that so good trees may plen|tifully
bring forth the fruite
of good Works. Yea it were
to be wished, that it might be
so watered, that it bring forth
those great good workes of
<PB N="165" REF="87">
buying-in Church liuings,
and building of Churches.
For the first many hungrie
soules doe cry, complaining
with the Eunuch;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 8, 31.</NOTE> How can
I vnderstand, except some
man guide mee? And some
that complaine not, are in
worse case than the other; for
they lie speechlesse and more
than halfe-dead, not feeling
their owne misery, the Le|uites
passing by them, and
leauing them in it. And in|deed
there is little outward
encouragement to drawe
them in, or at least to per|swade
their abiding, where
there is scarce a little cham|ber,
with a bed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 King. 4.</NOTE> a table, a
stoole &amp; a candlestick, to re|ceiue
them being come. And
this while the people perish
<PB N="166" REF="88">
for want of knowledge, and
being <HI>without a teaching
Priest,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Chron. 15. 3.</NOTE> they are not farre <HI>from
being without God,</HI> as it seemes
by the Prophet. For the se|cond,
I acknowledge that the
true religion hath both built
and repaired Churches: Nei|ther
is this chiefe Citie with|out
examples. But yet it were
good the roote of this fruite
were somewhat more wate|red:
For if these fruites did
abound, a Church would not
stand open to the raine, so
long after a fire, and per|chance
those stones would
bee put into their right pla|ces,
which now by many, no
doubt, are turned into stones
of stumbling and offence;
For euen to remoue an of|fence
did Christ cause <HI>Peter</HI>
<PB N="167" REF="88">
to cast in an Angle, and to
fetch money from a fish.
And surely if some would
but cast an Angle into their
superfluities, they might
take vp such a piece of mo|ney,
as would saue such an
offence. If it were to satis|fie
or serue the flesh, and for
outward glory, we see how
easily great summes are ex|pended,
and huge buildings
are raised. And I thinke
scarce any age of our Ance|stors,
hath equalled ours. But
when wee doe so much for
our selues, and so easily, so
little and so hardly for God,
doth not this shew, that the
roote of prophanenesse, and
contempt of God is too
much watered, and the root
of Grace too much starued
<PB N="168" REF="89">
and pined? But let vs feare
this building of our owne
houses with the contempt
of God and his houses; for
hee hath blasted it with a
Iudgement, and his owne
mouth hath told it vs.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Haggai. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Then
came the word of the Lord by
Haggai the Prophet, saying:
Is it time for you, O yee, to
dwell in your sieled houses, and
this house lye waste? Now
therefore saith the Lord of
Hostes, Consider your wayes.</HI>
And againe, <HI>Consider your
wayes. You looked for much,
and loe it came to little, and
when you brought it home, I
did blow vpon it: why, saith
the Lord of Hostes? Because of
mine house that is waste, and
yee runne euery man to his
owne house.</HI> Wherefore that
<PB N="169" REF="89">
the Church spiritual, which
is the house of God, and the
Church materiall, which is
the house of the hosue of
God, may bee edified and
built vp, yea that all good
fruites, euen all good works
may prosper and increase;
let not the roote of pro|phanenesse
starue and keepe
downe the roote of holi|nesse:
for hee that thus wa|geth
warre against good
workes, by killing the roote
of them, puts away from
himselfe the name of a
Christian, and puts on the
title of a Libertine. Fourth|ly,
it is a thing most fear|full,
and followed with in|finite
misery: For they that
fight against the grace of the
spirit, fight against the spirit
<PB N="170" REF="90">
whose grace it is. So when
the Prophets were resisted
by the Iews in whom Gods
spirit instructed, and spake,
S. <HI>Steuen</HI> saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nehem. 9. 20. 30. Act. 7.</NOTE> <HI>Yee doe al|wayes
resist the holy Ghost.</HI>
And S. <HI>Peter</HI> most plainely;
<HI>The spirit of glory,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 4. 14.</NOTE> <HI>and of God
resteth vpon you, which on
their part is euill spoken of,
but on your part hee is glori|fied.</HI>
Behold a fearfull thing,
with which <HI>Gamaliel</HI> af|frighted
the hard-hear|ted,
and stiff-necked Iewes:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 5. 39.</NOTE>
<HI>Lest yee bee found to fight a|gainst
God:</HI> For when the pot
will fight with the Potter,
wee know, it can expect no
end, but breaking in pieces:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 2. 9.</NOTE>
<HI>Thou shalt breake them with
a rod of Iron, thou shalt dash
them in pieces like a Potters
<PB N="171" REF="90">
vessell.</HI> Wherefore kisse the
sonne lest he be angry, and
yee perish from the way.
Kisse the spirit of the Son,
by which spirit hee kisseth
the soules of those that loue
him, and are loued of him.
This is the way to eternall
happinesse and saluation.
But if in stead of kissing, you
kicke against his Spirit, bee
yee sure yee shall perish
from the way of saluation.
For holinesse is the way to
happinesse; and if we resist
the spirit by which men are
sanctified, yee put from you
the Author of that holines,
by which we walke to hap|pinesse.
It is a prayer of our
Church, <HI>That our life may be
pure and holy, so that at the
last wee may come to Gods eter|nall
<PB N="172" REF="91">
ioy.</HI> Wherefore if pure|nesse
and holinesse bee the
way to eternall ioy, why
dost thou hate &amp; stop vp the
way, that leades to eternall
ioy? Surely if thou stop vp
this way to thy selfe and o|thers,
there remaines no o|ther
way for thee, but that
broad way which leadeth to
eternall destruction. Behold
the end of Gods enemies;
wherefore feare yee also,
<HI>Lest yee bee found fighters a|gainst
God:</HI> and remember,
that when you call Saints
Puritanes, you are Gods e|nemies,
and the titles which
follow that, are <HI>children of
wrath,</HI> and <HI>sons of perdition.</HI></P>
<P>But, though it be a righte|ous
thing with God to re|compence
tribulation to
<PB N="173" REF="91">
them that trouble you,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Thess. 1. 6. 7.</NOTE> yet
to you that are troubled, rest
shall be with the rest of the
Saints, when the Lord Iesus
shall bee reuealed from hea|uen.
And in the meane time
follow the example of the
same Lord Iesus: pitty their
ignorance, and out of that
pitty pray for them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 23. 34.</NOTE> <HI>Father
forgiue them, for they know
not what they doe.</HI> If a man
distracted doe raile on thee,
thou art more sorry for him,
than for thy selfe: Doe the
like in a case not vnlike.
Doe according to thy owne
knowledge, and not accor|ding
to his ignorance. Se|condly,
know the Diuells
aime in it, and then thou art
safe. His aime is to take thy
holinesse from thee, and to
<PB N="174" REF="92">
quench the spirit, or some
fruites of the spirit. Be thou
most carefull to keepe, what
hee is most carefull to take
away; for be thou sure, that
is a most precious Iewell
which thy greatest enemie
seekes most to take from
thee. Thy enemie plainely
tells thee the worth of it, by
his endeauours to steale it:
Wherefore let his malice be
a very motiue to keepe that
purenesse &amp; holinesse which
his malice setteth at so high
a price. Thirdly, vnderstand
the diuells language, &amp; thou
maist be very well pleased:
for in the Diuels language a
saint is a Puritane. Wherfore
know, that when for so me
good worke, hee calls thee
Puritane, vnderstand, that in
<PB N="175" REF="92">
his language he calleth thee
Saint:<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>More</HI> Medit.</NOTE> wherfore let this turn
to thee for a testimoniall,
that euen thy enemies being
Iudges, thou art such a one
as is truely honourable here
in earth, &amp; shall eternally be
honoured hereafter in hea|uen.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 5. 1.</NOTE>
For, <HI>blessed are the pure in
heart, for they shall see God.</HI></P>
<P>As for other sins, where|with
this Land is pressed
downe, I wish they were so
inuisible, that men should
need to looke into bookes
to finde them. It may not
be doubted, but where such
a bitter roote of prophane|nesse
and irreligion preuai|leth
so strongly, the cursed
fruites of it are too plenti|full.
But men bend not their
mindes to that counsell
<PB N="176" REF="93">
of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hag. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Consider your wayes.</HI>
Yea, the tree of knowledge
of good and euill, hath so
infected mens iudgements
with a carnall wisdome, that
they looke only for good
and euill in outward and
carnall things. If those
things goe well, all is well.
And euen for this very
cause, doth God punish vs
in outward things, that by
the euills which we regard,
wee may be brought to take
notice of the euills which
we regard not. For though
the carnall man doe not see
sinne to bee euill, but only
thinkes that to bee euill
which hee feeles, yet that e|uill
which he sees not, is the
cause of the euill which hee
feels. For there is an <HI>euill way</HI>
<PB N="177" REF="93">
of sinne, which drawes on
the <HI>euills</HI> of iudgement;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ionah. 3. 10</NOTE> and
as they come together, so
they goe together: For
when man turnes from the
euill way by repentance,
God turnes from&punc; the <HI>euill</HI>
which he said he would doe,
and doth it not. But of these
euills of sinne I haue often
spoken, and brought them
before mens eyes: but I pray
God to annoint our eyes
with that eye-salue of his
spirit, by which spirituall
things are seene and discer|ned,
that rightly seeing our
sinnes and rightly iudging
them, wee may escape the
iudgements of God.<NOTE PLACE="marg">All should aduance this re|pentance. And first be Magi|trate.</NOTE></P>
<P>19. From the sinnes to
be repented of; we passe to
the persons that ought to be
<PB N="178" REF="94">
principall Agents or Ad|uancers
of Repentance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oyle of Sc. Sect. 8. &amp; 9.</NOTE> It
hath beene formerly noted,
that it belongeth to all, and
among al, chiefly to the chie|fest,
by whom this dutie may
be best communicated to all.
And so notice was first taken
of the Magistrate, as being
first in Eminence.</P>
<P>And indeede the supreme
Magistrate, ouerspreading all
his people with a generall
Authoritie, most fitly enioy|neth,
and spreadeth out a ge|nerall
humiliation. There|fore
we read that Kings were
the Ordainers of generall
Fasts; &amp; Fasts being by them
made generall, haue produ|ced
generall Blessings. And
therefore is the Fast it selfe a
great benefite, bestowed by
<PB N="179" REF="94">
the Prince on his Subiects; it
being a general Summons to
Repentance and Humilia|tion,
whereby the Euills and
Miseries which lye vpon the
people may bee taken away
and turned into Blessings.
Yea, what greater benefite
can there be, than to bestow
that greatest and highest Re|medy?
which is able to cure
a people, though sicke at
heart; yea, when the vsuall
Remedies are sicke them|selues,
it is able to cure them:
and from thenceforth them|selues
being cured, they are
able to cure vs. And here I
cannot but extoll the fauour
of God to this Nation, and
the goodnesse of our gra|cious
King to his Subiects,
who in the straights and suf|ferings
<PB N="180" REF="95">
of this people, gaue
them this chiefe &amp; soueraign
Remedie. A gift, how euer
carnall men may esteeme it,
of principall value, and high|est
Consequence to a Nation
labouring in an Agony, vn|der
the Iudgements of God.
For as the greatest Tyranny
is expressed in that Chara|cter
of <HI>Ieroboam, Hee made
Israel to sinne;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. King. 15. 30.</NOTE> since he that
made Israel to sinne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. King. 17. 22. 23.</NOTE> made
Israel to perish: so is it the
greatest Mercy and Goodnes
of a Prince to draw the peo|ple
from sinne, by calling
them to Repentance. For be|ing
turned from sinne, the
perishing which attendeth
sinne is also turned away. By
this meanes did the King of
Nineueh more good to his
<PB N="181" REF="95">
Subiects, than all his Trea|sures,
all his policies, and all
the power of a Citie of three
dayes iourney, could haue
done for them. For when
God who is a spirit, comes to
fight with a Nation, those
carnal weapons are too gross
wherewith to fight against a
spirit; but spiritual weapons
can onely serue the turne in a
spirituall warfare. But wee
need not to trauell farre, ey|ther
to ancient times or for|reine
places, to shew the be|nefits
and blessings, which a
King procureth to his peo|ple
by calling them vnto
publicke Humiliation: for e|uen
these late acts of Humi|liation
which haue been per|formed
by the Decree of our
Soueraigne, haue beene fol|lowed
<PB N="182" REF="96">
with immediate bles|sings,
euen blessings that fol|low
them so close, that they
doe more than point at their
Causes;<NOTE PLACE="marg">See more particular obseruati|on of these blessings. Sect. 22.</NOTE> for they doe touch
them, and goe hand in hand
with them. Yea these bles|sings
were affixed to them, as
the Seales of the most High;
wherby they were approued
that are past, and others are
inuited for the time to come.
And as the publike Com|mand
of Humiliation, sent
forth by the Magistrate, doth
make way for a Blessing vp|on
his people: so also doth
his particular Repentance
and Prayer. For euen the
particular vertues of a Prince
are generall benefits. For as
when a Prince doth some
great sinne, God may breake
<PB N="183" REF="96">
in by that sinne, vpon the sins
of the people: so the Re|pentance
and Prayer of a
Prince, may stand in the
breach, and diuert the Iudge|ments
either broken in, or
ready to breake in vpon the
people. There is a president
of both in King <HI>Dauid:</HI> for
vpon the occasion of his sin
in numbering the people, the
plague brake in vpon Israel.
And againe, by his humilia|tion
and praier, God staied
the plague from breaking in
vpon Iudah and Ierusalem.
And indeed this Story teach|eth
Princes, by the example
of a King according to the
heart of the King of kings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Sam. 24. 17.</NOTE>
in publike Iudgements, espe|cially
to looke to their owne
sinnes, and to say with <HI>Dauid,
<PB N="184" REF="97">
It is I that haue sinned, but
these sheepe what haue they
done?</HI> As on the other side
it teacheth the people especi|ally
to looke on their owne
sinnes, since wee see by this
example, that the sinnes of
the people may be the occa|sions
of the sinnes of the
Prince, and of those iudge|ments
that follow them. And
thus the precious oyntment
of sauing Health, beginning
to bee powred on the head,
may drop downe euen to the
skirts of his garments: and
by the fauour of God, it may
be truly said of the Anointed
of the Lord;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lam. 4. 20.</NOTE> <HI>Vnder his sha|dow
we shall liue.</HI></P>
<P>20 A second aduancer of
humiliation and repentance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A second aduancer of Repen|tance is the Mini|ster.</NOTE>
is the Minister; and he should
<PB N="185" REF="97">
aduance it both in publike
and particular, by his functi|on,
and by his life. And sure|ly
there are many that doe
both, and are like Iohn Bap|tist,
who was both a burning
and a shining light. Inwardly
burning with that heauenly
fire, wherewith the spirit
baptizeth; from that fire shi|neth
forth the light, both of
doctrine and life. And for
these wee owe great thankes
to the Lord of the Haruest,
that hath sent forth such la|bourers
into his haruest. For
these also with Moses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 106. 23.</NOTE> stand
in the breach, and keepe out
the Iudgements of God, and
that with violence. For there
is no small might in a true
Prophet of God to defend
a Nation from the Iudge|ments
<PB N="186" REF="98">
of God: for if a Pro|phet
and a King may bee be|leeued
when they speake of
such Prophets,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. King. 2. 12.</NOTE> <HI>Elisha</HI> saith
it of <HI>Eliiah,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. King. 13. 14.</NOTE> and <HI>Ioash</HI> saith
the same of <HI>Elisha.</HI> So that
the encrease of these, are
both a signe and cause of
safety to a Nation: and the
diminishing of these, a signe
and cause of ruine and deso+lation.
For what were <HI>those
times</HI> when <HI>there was no peace
to him that went out,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Chro. 15.</NOTE> <HI>nor to
him that came in,</HI> but when
Israel was <HI>without a teaching
Priest?</HI> Wherefore to those
Elders that doubly build, by
life and doctrine, there be|longs
iustly double honour;
and indeed by their two-fold
building, there ariseth a two-fold
safetie, both to Church
<PB N="187" REF="98">
and Common-wealth. And
as it is a pleasant &amp; iust thing,
that to the skilfull builders
of this twofold worke there
should be double honour; so
it is a pleasant &amp; good sight,
to see those that haue this
double honour, to doe this
twofold worke. And first for
the publicke; It was verie
comely to see the formost is
honour, to march in the head
of the troupe in the late hu|miliation,
which was a holy
warre against the iudgements
of God. A right reuerend
Father and a reuerend Deane
diuiding the day, and the
works of the day, both pray|er
and preaching, giue en|couragement
to the exercises
of the day. And I hope that
more places than one are not
<PB N="188" REF="99">
without patternes of spiritu|all
Captaines, that did leade
forth their souldiers into this
spirituall warfare. For it is a
hopefull and comfortable
thing, when there is a zeale
and feruency in this worke
of Reconciliation, and if it
be taken to heart as a thing in
earnest, and especially by
the Priesthood. For when
God stirreth vp the Priests
to weepe between the Porch
and the Altar, and to say:
<HI>Spare thy people, O Lord, and
giue not thine Heritage to re|proach,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioel. 2. 17. 18.</NOTE>
he heareth that which
is spoken by his owne stir|ring
and motion: And so it
followes; <HI>Then will the</HI>
LORD <HI>bee iealous for his
Land, and pitty his people.</HI>
But if any man withdraw
<PB N="189" REF="99">
himselfe, the sicke soule of
an afflicted Church or Com|mon-wealth,
can haue no
pleasure in him, nor profit
by him. He that withdrawes
himselfe from sauing his
flock by publike indeauours,
(euen in these workes of Hu|miliation)
and in his perso|nall
sanctity, this man seemes
to be a trespasser, by destroy|ing
that which hee ought to
haue built. And for the late
solemnities, it is a griefe and
losse, if any able man, should
out of coldnesse of zeale, or
loue of ease, performe the
seruice of those dayes, with
that which cost him nothing.
Euen the obdurate Iewes,
when they saw <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Bar|nabas</HI>
in the Sinagogue, they
called vpon them for a word
<PB N="190" REF="100">
of exhortation. I deny not
the Scriptures which allow
the publike reading of the
Scriptures, neither doe I de|tract
from the worth and va|lue
of that which Authorie
sets forth, deriued from
Scripture; But withall, I
know, that when Christ a|scended
vp on high, he gaue
gifts vnto men, and the gifts
which hee gaue, were giuen
for the edification of the
Church: And I doe not
know, yea I beleeue not, that
it was the intent of men of
higher place and authority,
by their paines, and industry,
to exclude the indeauours
and industrie, of those of
lower place, or that they did
labour, that these might take
their case. An able Minister
<PB N="191" REF="100">
resident on his flocke, can
apply the present worke of
humiliation, to the sins and
sicknesses of his flock, which
in euery flocke, being some|what
different, it is impossi|ble
so to comprehend them
all in generall exhortations,
that the particular shep|heard,
may not yet haue
something left to say, that
may particularly concerne
the flocke, wherof God hath
made him ouerseer. Surely if
preaching <HI>in season</HI> and <HI>out of
season</HI> be enioyned, this time
must needs bee one of them,
and I take it, <HI>in season.</HI> For
this day, should bee a day of
zeale, of contending and stri|uing
with God; a day where|in
the hearts of men should
bee torne and broken, that
<PB N="166" REF="101">
from broken hearts, there
may ascend vnto God the
sweet and acceptable sacri|fice
of Inuocation &amp; Prayer.
Now the zeale of the Mini|ster,
expressed both in his la|bour
for the Word, &amp; in the
Word for which he labours,
prouoketh &amp; enkindleth the
zeale of his people. And the
word of God being applyed
to the root of those very sins,
wherewith a flocke is ouer|growne,
it is like a plough to
turne vp those sinnes by the
rootes, and to breake vp the
fallow ground wherein they
lay, and so to make broken
hearts, which onely can offer
vp that acceptable sacrifice.</P>
<P>And now for priuate pra|ctice
of holinesse, and edifi|ing
by conuersation without
<PB N="193" REF="101">
the word, I wish there were
no cause for God to say, <HI>I
haue a few things against thee.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reu. 2. 14. 20.</NOTE>
And I wish they were so few,
that few words needed to be
said. But if they bee not so
few, though speaking may be
offensiue, yet silence is more
dangerous. Wounds indeed
doe paine when they are tou|ched
by the Healer, but they
kill if they bee not touched.
And there is no comparison
betweene the offence that
may bee taken by opening a
sore in the cure of it, and that
which the sore giues, when
it opens it selfe to the world
by visible corruption. And
then there is on this side also
an odds and aduantage of
mortall danger. For wee
know that whereof it is said,
<PB N="194" REF="102">
it cannot long stand with|out,
which is ruinous
within. But if not of this
time, yet let mee speake of
S. <HI>Pauls</HI> time.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 3. 18.</NOTE> There were
some in that time, of whom
he spake weeping: And sure|ly
if there bee such at this
time, hee that speakes duely,
cannot speak without mour|ning.
For is it not a lamenta|ble
thing to heare a good fel|low,
complaine of good fel|lowship,
as if hee were put
downe in his owne professi|on?
But I am affraid of Gath
and Ashkelon: Only I wish,
that such were so knowne,
that they might not bee
knowne, and that this Nayle
may bee so fastned by the
masters of the assemblies,
that if the children hold their
<PB N="195" REF="102">
peace, the stones doe not
speake.</P>
<P>But to the Aduersary I say,
What is the chaffe to the
wheare? Shee which is cal|led
barren, and seemes to
them to haue no husband,
because her husband is in
heauen, hath borne more
children, than shee that hath
an husband on earth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 68. 11.</NOTE> <HI>God
gaue the Word, and great was
the assemblie of Preachers.</HI>
Preachers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 33. 9.</NOTE> that <HI>haue obserued
thy word, and kept thy Coue|nant;</HI>
That <HI>teach Iacob thy
iudgements, and Israel thy
law.</HI></P>
<P>And let these holy Le|uites,
and Ministers of the
liuing God, neuer leaue cal|ling
on the Father of mercy,
and God of all consolation,
<PB N="196" REF="103">
vntill by his mercy they doe
binde the hands of his Iu|stice,
so that Iustice it selfe be
inforced to aske leaue of
them to punish, and to say,
<HI>Let mee alone.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 32. 10.</NOTE> Thus did <HI>Mo|ses</HI>
that excellent Leuite, pre|uaile
vpon God for the Is|raelites,
when they had com|mitted
that horrible sinne of
Idolatry in the golden Calfe.
For vpon the prayer of <HI>Mo|ses,</HI>
challenging God for his
free goodnesse, by which he
freely began to bee good vn|to
them; for his Names sake
which should bee dishonou|red
among the Egyptians;
for his Oaths sake, made to
their fathers, to be mercifull
to them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vers. 14.</NOTE> <HI>The Lord repented
of the euill which hee thought
to doe vnto them.</HI> And so did
<PB N="197" REF="103">
another Leuite, euen blessed
<HI>Samuel;</HI> for when Israel had
sinned, and was therefore in
feare of the Philistims,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sum. 7. 8. 9.</NOTE> <HI>Sa|muel
cryed vnto the Lord for
Israel, and the Lord heard him.</HI>
And the power of such pray|ers
is so preualent, that God
himselfe makes it the signe of
a desperate estate, when a
Nation is come to that
point,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ier. 15. 1.</NOTE> that <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Samuel</HI>
will not be heard. Wherfore
for Sions sake let them not
hold their peace, yea for their
owne sakes also: for besides
their owne interest in the
common good, or euill, it is
a sinne in them not to pray
for the people; therefore <HI>Sa|muel</HI>
saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 12. 23.</NOTE> <HI>God forbid that I
should sinne against the Lord,
in ceasing to pray for you.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="104">
20. But because the same
<HI>Samuel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Thirdly, the people must re|pent, if the people wil be saued. <HI>ver.</HI> 24. 25.</NOTE> who accounts it a
sinne not to pray for the peo|ple,
yet hath little hope of
his prayers except the peo|ple
repent; hee addeth, <HI>Onely
feare the Lord, and serue him
in truth with all your heart:
but if yee shall still doe wicked|ly,
yee shall be consumed.</HI> For
though prayers of Pro|phets
and Priests be power|full
with God to draw down
his mercy, yet there is no v|suall
course of mercy to bee
expected by a sinfull and im|penitent
Nation. Wee reade
and heare, that though God
shew a great mercy, euen
mercy vnto thousands, yet it
is <HI>on them that loue him,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 1. 50.</NOTE> <HI>and
keep his commandements:</HI> And
<HI>the mercy of God, is vpon them
<PB N="199" REF="104">
that feare him from generati|on
to generation.</HI> Therefore
before <HI>Samuel</HI> vndertakes to
offer sacrifice and prayer for
Israel, hee speakes vnto Isra|el,
to put away their sinnes, to
prepare their hearts vnto the
Lord, and to serue him only:
And when they had done so,
and with fasting acknowled|ged
their sinnes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 7. 3. &amp;c.</NOTE> then <HI>Samuel</HI>
prayed, and the prayer of <HI>Sa|muel</HI>
was heard, and the
Lord sent them a deliuerance
from heauen. Wherefore let
not the people thinke to cast
all on the Ministers, and ima|gine
that good men in the
Ministerie, will serue to saue
bad men in the Laitie. But
let them striue to be such by
repentance and holines, that
the prayers of the Ministrie
<PB N="200" REF="105">
may bee heard for their pre|seruation.
For otherwise by
their sinnes they binde the
hands of the Ministers, which
they desire should bee lifted
vp for them, yea they cause
God both to stop his owne
eares, and the mouthes of the
Ministers. For when they
loue to wander, and refraine
not their feet from euill, then
comes forth that fearefull
command;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ier. 7. 16.</NOTE> <HI>Pray not for this
people, neither lift vp cry nor
prayer for them, neither make
intercession to mee, for I will
not heare thee.</HI> And for their
owne prayer, that will not be
heard, though it come with
fasting; which also is, and
hath beene otherwise an ad|uancer
of vndenyable pray|er:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ier. 14. 11. 12.</NOTE>
<HI>When they fast I will
<PB N="201" REF="105">
not heare their crie.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore it concernes
the people by turning from
their sinnes, to make them|selues
capable of the prayers
of their Ministers, and not to
vrge them to speake, by in|treaties,
and to stop their
mouthes by sinnes. Let eue|ry
particular man search his
particular sinnes, according
to directions already giuen;
and especially when hee
feeles any griefe, or sees any
terrour, let them feele and
behold it as a spurre to repen|tance.
So shall lesser iudge|ments
keepe off the greater;
it being a great mercy of
God to chastise with rods, to
saue punishing with Scorpi|ons,
and a great wisdome in
man, to make a right vse of
<PB N="202" REF="106">
this mercy. Wherefore let
the Land mourne for their
sinnes, that it mourne not for
an vtter desolation. All the
families together,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zach. 12. 12 &amp; 13. 1.</NOTE> and euery
familie apart, and euery man
apart: And then in that day
there shall bee a fountaine o|pened
for sinne and vnclean|nesse,
to wash them away,
and the iudgements that fol|low
them.</P>
<P>But howsoeuer the multi|tude
doe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Num. 11. 4.</NOTE> who most com|monly
are like the old <HI>mixed
multitude,</HI> rather giuen to
murmuring when their lusts
are vnsatisfied, than to tur|ning
<HI>vnto him that smites
them;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay 9. 13.</NOTE> let the mourners that
are <HI>marked,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezek. 9. 4.</NOTE> doe the office for
which they are <HI>marked.</HI> If
they reply, that they are few,
<PB N="203" REF="106">
and their fewnesse doth dis|courage
them: it may be an|swered,
The fewer they are,
the more they should
mourne, to supply that mour|ning
which is wanting in o|thers;
yea to mourne for
that want. Againe, thou
maist bee the man that may
make vp the ten, the twenty,
or thirty, euen that set num|ber
which may saue a So|dome,
a sinfull City, or King|dome:
yea sometimes one
man may stand in a gap, and
bee the repairer of a breach.
<HI>Amos</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Amos 7.</NOTE> was a man subiect to
infirmities as we are, and hee
was but one, yet a Iudge|ment
being denounced
when he said, <HI>O Lord, forgiue
I beseech thee, by whom shall
Iacob arise, for hee is small?</HI>
<PB N="204" REF="107">
Then, <HI>the Lord repented for
this, It shall not bee, saith the
Lord.</HI> Lastly, though thou
seeme to thy self to be alone,
and with <HI>Elias</HI> thou knowest
no more, yet with <HI>Elias</HI> thou
maiest be deceiued,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. King 1. 6 10. 18.</NOTE> and there
may bee seuen thousand
which thou knowest not, that
haue not bowed their knee to
<HI>Baal;</HI> and thy mourning, ioy|ned
to the mourning of that
remnant which the Lord
hath left,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay 1. 9.</NOTE> may saue vs from
being like vnto Sodome and
Gomorrha. Howsoeuer, do
thy part; let the Souldier of
Christ be found in his place,
euen when iudgements are
comming: If thou saue not
all, thou shalt be sure to saue
thy selfe; perchance tempo|rally,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ier. 1. 19. &amp; 39. 18.</NOTE>
without doubt eternal|ly.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="107">
And now to summe vp all,
I wish that both Magistrate,
Minister and people may go
so throughly with the truth
of repentance, that sinnes and
sinfulnesse being put off, the
iudgements that cleaue vnto
them may also be put off.
And because this is not done
but by putting on the spirit
of Christ Iesus, by the power
wherof the kingdome of Sa|than
is put downe, and the
kingdome of Christ erected;
I pray that wee may come to
this point of putting on the
spirit of Christ Iesus. All the
rest is but the forme of god|linesse,
but in the spirit of
Christ is the life of godlines:
&amp; howsoeuer men may flat|ter
themselues, they are not
Christians except they bee
<PB N="206" REF="108">
one spirit with Christ Iesus.
For CHRIST being called<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 8. 9.</NOTE>
Christ because he is anointed<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 6. 17</NOTE>
aboue his fellowes with the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 45. 7.</NOTE>
spirit without measure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cant. 1. 3.</NOTE> wee
are truly to bee called Chri|stians
by beeing annointed
with the same spirit accor|ding
to our measure.
But no annointing, no
true Christianitie. But if <HI>this
ointment dwell in vs,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Ioh. 2. 27.</NOTE> then
haue wee Christ Iesus, and
with him all the promises of
God;<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Cor. 1. 20 21.</NOTE> for in Christ Iesus all
the promises of God are Yea
and Amen.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 78. 49.</NOTE> Then haue wee
power to wrestle and ouer|throw
the principalities and
powers which are often the
Inflicters of the iudgements
of God, and continually
the Tempters, prouoking vs
<PB N="207" REF="108">
to those sinnes, for which
iudgements are inflicted. For
it is the Spirit of Christ only
that settles a Church, and
makes it a pillar of Truth,
vnremoueable by Sathan.
And most commonly where
a Church is thus settled, the
Nation is also settled which
containes such a Church;
and the Diuell is not suffered
to preuaile against the later,
because of the former. But
when a Church growes spi|ritually
cold, &amp; turnes from
the life and heart of godli|nesse
to an outside of profes|sion,
then God growes cold
to vs in loue; but in wrath
hee growes hote against vs.
If a Nation turne from the
spirit to the flesh, though
they be as great as the gyants
<PB N="208" REF="109">
in the old world, and as the
Anakims in the new; yet
they are but great pieces of
flesh, and an ouerflowing
floud will destroy the one,
and a destroying sword will
cut off the other. When the
daies of persecution were en|ded,
wee receiued the word
with ioy in the holy Ghost;
wee did then runne well,
who doth let vs from run|ning
so still? Yea then God
mightily prospered vs, and
made his owne word good
vnto vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Chro. 15. 2.</NOTE> <HI>The Lord is with you,
while yee be with him.</HI> Why
then should wee not bee still
with him, as at first, that hee
as at first may stil be with vs?
Those that are of God, the
word and wisedome of God
should moue them; for that
<PB N="209" REF="109">
saith to them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ier. 6. 16.</NOTE> <HI>Inquire the old
way,</HI> and, <HI>Remember from
whence thou art fallen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reu. 2. 5.</NOTE> <HI>and re|pent.</HI>
And those that are of
the world the wisedome of
the world should moue; for
thus saith their Oracle. <HI>It is
more cleare than the day,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Disc. vpon Liuy lib. 3. cap. 1.</NOTE> <HI>that
such bodies</HI> (of Common|wealths
&amp;c.) <HI>doe not endure
except they bee renewed; and
the manner whereby to renew
them, is to bring them backe to
their beginnings.</HI> And then
comming to Religion, wher|of
hee discourseth vnder the
name of Sectes, he saith, <HI>It
is manifest that such renew|ings
are necessary, euen by ex|periments
in our Religion.</HI>
And indeede by his owne

<P>Thus should Religion bee

of the goodness which
is in it. By those that know
it not in the inside, but onely
some outward goood effects

<P>21 The great remedy of

<PB N="211" REF="110">
would not doubt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 27. 22.</NOTE> but wee
should see <HI>Paul</HI> standing
forth againe, and heare him
saying: <HI>I exhort you to bee of
good cheere, for there shall bee
no losse of any mans life among
you.</HI> And I speake it not with|out
ground; for God him|selfe
hath giuen vs some ear|nests
of this safety. For as
the same <HI>Paul</HI> gaue this for
the reason of his Encourage|ment;
<HI>There stood by me this
night the Angel of God:</HI> so
may I say for a ground of
our Comfort; Not onely
the Angel of God, but the
Lord of the Angels hath
stood by vs in the night of

and by a manifest
grant of our petitions vpon
humiliation, hath giuen vs
<PB N="212" REF="111">
good proofe that more hu|miliation
may obtaine more
safetie and deliuerance. Vp|on
a little humiliation, <HI>for a
little space grace hath bin she|wed
from the Lord our God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezra. 9. 8.</NOTE> <HI>to
leaue vs a remnant to escape,
and to giue vs a nayle in his
holy place, that our God may
lighten our eyes, and giue vs a
little reuiuing.</HI> The first Fast
was followed with miracu|lous
successe. Neuer a grea|ter
pestilence in our greatest
Citie, recorded in these later
ages: and I thinke neuer so
great a pestilence, so soone &amp;
so cleane swept away. Yea,
though the Citie were not
long after thronged with a
double meeting, so that it
should be thought, that the
chambers of death were fil|led
<PB N="213" REF="111">
with the liuing; yet death
being co~manded to sheath his
sword, could not touch life,
though fallen into the armes
of it. So death by Gods mer|cy
was turned to vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 31. 29.</NOTE> as <HI>Laban</HI>
toward <HI>Iacob;</HI> though it had
a hurtfull power, it had no
power to hurt vs. But when
the greatest Pestilence hath
thus the speediest end, it is a
very wonder, and plainely
shewes a hand aboue Nature.
And what hand doe we finde
to be the cause of extraordi|nary
changes, but <HI>Dextera
excelsi,</HI> the right hand of the
Highest? And if wee looke
below, by what lower
meanes the right hand of the
most High hath beene mo|ued
to make these changes,
<HI>euen to repent of the euill,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ionah. 3.</NOTE>
<PB N="214" REF="112">
<HI>which hee said hee would doe,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioel. 2.</NOTE>
<HI>and did it not,</HI> wee finde that
Humiliation with Fasting is
a principall meanes. Where|fore
this way being taken by
vs, and this effect following
it, what can wee thinke but
that by this way, Gods mer|cy
came vnto vs?</P>
<P>A second blessing follow|ing
a second Fast, was the
stay and turning away of a
Famine; And this also was
strange and extraordinarie,
euen by a strange and extra|ordinary
change. For the
Famine was posting apace
towards vs, yea it flew on the
wings of the cloudes, which
dropped downe death and
destruction, by destroying
the fruites of the earth. Yet
in the very speed of this
<PB N="215" REF="112">
blacke Horse, the Fast gaue it
a stop, and the word of God
set that day for a bound to
it; And concerning that day,
a command came to the
cloudes, <HI>Thus farre shall yee
goe, and here shall yee stay
your destroying waters.</HI> For
wee know, that this very day
was the end of that iudge|ment.
Now when wee see a
Iudgement stop in such a
day, what shall we thinke, but
that the worke of that day,
was the stop of the iudge|ment?
For otherwise, that
day wherein wee were relie|ued
had no more vertue, than
the dayes wherein wee were
punished. Besides, by both
rule &amp; patterne in the Scrip|tures,
wee finde, that this ef|fect
by such causes may bee
<PB N="216" REF="113">
produced. The Scripture
saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 11. 31.</NOTE> <HI>If wee iudge our selues,
wee shall not bee iudged.</HI>
God was readie to iudge vs
with a Famine, which is a
Fast of necessitie; We vnder|went
a voluntary Famine by
a voluntary Fast: So the Fa|mine
meeting with a Fa|mine,
went no farther, but
dyed in it. The businesse
which it should haue done,
was done, and the end being
attained, that which moued
to the end, rested. And it is
not without patterne, that
spirituall workes, haue boun|ded
the iudgements of God
with a day. Yea God him|selfe
doth call vs to set a
Marke on that day; and by
that, on others that are like
it. When the Iewes for the
<PB N="217" REF="113">
neglect of a worke that ten|ded
to Gods glory, were pu|nished
with pouerty and
scarsitie; yet in that very day
wherein they began that
worke which God required,
there was a change of curses
into blessings: whereupon
God calls vpon them; <HI>Consi|der
from this day,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hag. 2. 18.</NOTE> <HI>and vp|ward;
from this day will I
blesse you.</HI></P>
<P>Thus by the good hand of
God vpon vs, there hath
beene a change and deliue|rance
from two of the great
scourges, wherewith God
professeth that hee scourgeth
the sinfull Nations of the
earth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezek. 14.</NOTE> And if in two euills
hee haue deliuered vs, why
may we not hope, that hee
will deliuer vs in the third?
<PB N="218" REF="114">
If he haue deliuered vs from
the Beare and the Lyon, why
may wee not hope that hee
will deliuer vs from a third,
though it be as bigge as <HI>Goli|ah?</HI>
It is a sure signe, that
Gods eare is yet open to vs;
and while his eares are open,
there is hope for a Nation:
only let vs come to make
sure this hope to vs, by ma|king
sure and right steps vnto
it. A first should bee, praise
and thanks-giuing, for these
great saluations which wee
haue already receiued. It
hath beene shewed before,
that by thankfulnesse for old
benefites God is moued to
giue new, and that where hee
reapeth plentifully, he will
plentifully sow. Therefore
we must be thankfull for the
<PB N="219" REF="114">
former, it wee will hope, vp|on
sure grounds, to receiue
the latter; and wee must giue
thankfulnesse for blessings
past, as a pledge and pawne
vnto God, that hee shall not
lose his due thankes and
praise for benefites to come.
And that our thankfulnesse
may bee hearty, it must pro|ceed
from the loue of God;
for the true taste of Gods
goodnesse in blessings, can|not
but much moue vs to
loue him whose sweetnesse
wee taste. Therefore the
Psalmist saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 116. 1.</NOTE> <HI>I loue the Lord,
because hee hath heard mee.</HI>
And surely true loue will
bring forth true obedience.
Christ who is truth, hath said;
<HI>If a man loue mee, he will keep
my words.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 14. 23.</NOTE> And indeed obe|dience
<PB N="220" REF="115">
is the best thankful|nesse.
It is better than the sa|crifice
of praisein the calues
of the lips; But both toge|ther
are best: For, <HI>who so of|fereth
praise, honoureth mee,
and to him that ordereth his
conuersation aright,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 50. 23.</NOTE> <HI>will I shew
the saluation of God.</HI> Where|fore
our Liturgie doth make
an entire thanks-giuing, for
a deliuerance from the Pesti|lence,
when it offers the
soules and bodies deliuered,
to be a liuing sacrifice vnto
God, and withall praiseth
and magnifieth Gods mer|cies
in the midst of the Con|gregation.</P>
<P>A second step to a sure
hope, is perseuerance and
constancie, in the vse of those
meanes by which wee attai|ned
<PB N="221" REF="115">
these blessings already
receiued. The same meanes
to which Gods eare hath
beene open, it will still bee
open; yea being now ope|ned
already, it is much easier
to keepe it open, than if it
were shut, to open it. Where|fore
this doore of mercy be|ing
open, let vs by pressing
into it, not only keepe it o|pen,
but open it wider, vn|till
all mercies bee obtained,
that may heale our miseries.
And as repentance and inuo|cation,
should by euery one
particularly, and continual|ly
bee set on worke, to moue
God to continue and perfect
his good worke of mercy in
vs, and vpon vs, so it is hum|bly
and heartily to bee desi|red,
that the same publike
<PB N="222" REF="116">
meanes, and manner of hu|miliation
may not long bee
intermitted, vntill God make
his face to shine on this Na|tion,
in a full deliuerance,
from generall troubles, dan|gers
and straites: For why
should wee leaue to seeke
God by those meanes, wher|in
God doth not leaue to
heare vs? And why should
wee leaue to vse medicines,
as long as there remaine di|seases?
God hath shewed vs
the way how to bee heard
and healed. Yea hee hath
assured vs of healing this
way, by the earnests of
health which this way hee
hath sent vnto vs: And shall
sicknesse giue ouer the Physi|cian,
before the Physician
giue it ouer? shall Need bee
<PB N="223" REF="116">
weary of asking and recei|uing,
before Bounty is wea|ry
of hearing and giuing?
O let vs not shut vp Gods
mercies against our selues,
before God doe shut them
vp against vs, but while the
oyle of mercy is running,
let vs by humiliation, re|pentance
and inuocation en|large
our vessells, and open
our mouthes wide, that hee
may fill them. If God had
denyed vs, the example of
the Canaanitish woman
would haue inuited vs to
seeking, whose faith was
commended, and rewarded
with a miracle, for importu|nity
after rough denyalls.
But now God hath granted
and heard vs, were it not a
great neglect of Gods good|nesse,
<PB N="224" REF="117">
and our owne happi|nesse,
not to goe on in spea|king?
For as it is very fit to
be said when the Lord spea|keth,
<HI>Speake Lord, for thy ser|uant
heareth;</HI> so it is fit to be
said, when the Lord hea|reth,
<HI>Speake seruant, for the
Lord heareth.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 18.</NOTE> Thus did <HI>A|braham,</HI>
continue praying
for Sodom, because God
continued hearing, and ne|uer
left, vntill hee brought
the conditions of Sodoms
deliuerance to bee so easie,
that for tenne righteous all
Sodom might haue beene
spared. And surely if our
perseuerance in humiliation
and prayer shall not stop, it
may worke the like effect,
and so our hope may bee
sure.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 5.</NOTE> For <HI>experience</HI> saith the
<PB N="225" REF="117">
Apostle, <HI>breedes hope,</HI> and
such hope as doth not make
ashamed. And if hope bee
the fruite of experience,
surely wee had experience
that God heareth our pray|ers,
and why then shall wee
not also haue hope that hee
will heare the like prayers
hereafter? The Apostle that
teacheth vs this fruite of ex|perience
in his doctrine,
teacheth it also by his pra|ctice.
For when he hath had
experience of Gods good|nesse,
hee inferreth that trust
vpon it, which is the ground
of things hoped for: <HI>Who
deliuered vs from so great a
death, and doth deliuer:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 1. 10.</NOTE> And
now behold his confidence
and hope: <HI>In whom we trust
that hee will yet deliuer vs.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="118">
22 Neither may our pre|sent
lowness,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our low|nesse or the lownes of the Church, may not destroy our hope if <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="2 letters">yned to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 letter">pen|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 letter">nce.</NOTE> or the lownesse
of those that haue reformed
Religion, and purged it from
Idolatrie, take away the hope
of Recouery: For lownesse
is the very way to exalta|tion,
and Weakenesse to
Strength. Wee see here that
before S^t. <HI>Paul</HI> came to this
experience of Gods deliue|rance,
from whence hee ga|thers
sure hope for deliue|rance
to come, he receiued in
himselfe the sentence of
death. So <HI>that a pressing a|boue
measure,</HI> and such a pres|sing
as makes an impression
of the sentence of death, is
the way to deliuerance. And
there are diuers reasons why
it should be so. First on
Gods side: God himselfe
<PB N="227" REF="118">
professeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Cor. 12. 9.</NOTE> <HI>My strength is
made perfect in weakenesse.</HI> So
that weakenesse is a fit subiect
whereon God vseth to glo|rifie
his strength: therefore
weakenesse may encourage
men, if they be like-minded
to S^t. <HI>Paul;</HI> for hereupon he
saith, <HI>I will most gladly glory
in my infirmities: for when I
am weake, then am I strong.</HI>
He is so farre from being dis|couraged,
that he is encou|raged
by his weakenesse, be|cause
weakenesse drawing to
it the power of God, be|comes
stronger than the
strength of men without
God. Hee that first brought
light out of darkenesse, and
in Christ Iesus hath brought
life out of death, he goes on
commonly to all his great
<PB N="228" REF="119">
Workes in a way of contra|ries;
that one contrary ari|sing
out of another, all the
honour of the worke may be
wholly reserued to God, and
all eyes turned wholly to
him: for there is nothing
on earth to looke on for a
Cause, but a contrary; and
that euen common Reason
will tell plainly, cannot pro|duce
his contrary. And this
course of God is so vsuall,
that he hath Titles affixed to
him, expressing it: <HI>God who
raised the dead,</HI> and, <HI>God who
brought light out of darkeness,</HI>
and, <HI>God who comforteth the
Abiect.</HI> Againe, the Low|nesse
of Gods children giues
God all the glory in the de|struction
of their enemies.
So as God was glorified in
<PB N="229" REF="119">
raising vp their Lownesse, so
is hee also glorified while by
their Lownesse hee takes
downe the Height and Pride
of the enemie. For the weak|ness
of those who ouercome,
giues away the glory of ouer|comming
from themselues
vnto God, who by weaknesse
ouercometh power. This
God plainely sheweth to bee
a way by which hee workes
out his glory, in that storie
of <HI>Gideon:</HI> For as long as
<HI>Gideons</HI> armie had in it the
strength of a multitude, the
multitude was a hinderance
to this glorie. For so the vi|ctorie
might haue been taken
from God, and giuen to men,
because they were many.
Therfore he findes fault with
his armie, as being vnfit for
<PB N="230" REF="120">
his glorie, while there was
any such number in it, as
might possibly take away
the glorie of the victorie
from God, to it selfe. Ther|fore
he saith, <HI>The people that
are with thee are too many for
me to giue the Midianites into
their hands,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iudg. 7.</NOTE> <HI>lest Israel vaunt
themselues against me, saying:
Mine own hand hath saued me.</HI>
Wherefore God pares his
armie, and makes it fit for his
glory, by many diminutions;
neuer leauing vntill hee
brought it to so few hun|dreds,
that there was left no
ground of glorying in it self,
but that hee who glorieth,
must needes glorie in the
Lord. The Israelites were
kept downe by the Egypti|ans
in most cruell slauery and
<PB N="231" REF="120">
bondage: for <HI>they made the
Israelites to serue with rigour,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 7. 13. &amp; 2. 23.</NOTE>
so that <HI>they sighed and cried by
reason of their bondage.</HI> And
when they did but speake for
libertie, their burdens were
encreased, and that so heaui|ly,
that they were in meere
despaire and deadnesse of
heart; so that when <HI>Moses</HI>
told them of freedome, <HI>they
hearkned not vnto Moses for</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 6. 9.</NOTE>
<HI>anguish of Spirit and for cruell
bondage.</HI> But for this hope|lesse
and distressed Nation,
which had no helpe nor
hope in it selfe, did God glo|rifie
his power vpon the
pride of <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> and the
strength of Egypt: So that
for the victorie which God
alone gaineth vpon the E|gyptians
for Israel, but with|out
<PB N="232" REF="121">
out Israel, <HI>Iethro</HI> duely glo|rifies
him:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 18. 11.</NOTE> <HI>Now I know that
the Lord is greater than all
gods: for in the thing wherein
they delt proudly, he was aboue
them.</HI> God that taketh down
the proude, when there is no
helpe in man to bring them
downe, getteth to himselfe
the glorie of their abasing.
It were infinite and endlesse
to produce the patternes and
presidents of this kinde of
working, by which God
workes out his glory. When
Kingdomes and Empires are
at the greatest, then GOD
takes them downe common|ly,
by low and contemptible
meanes. And so euen at the
height of the Romane Em|pire,
that Empire was taken
down by the Northren peo|ple,
<PB N="233" REF="121">
whom they in contempt
did account and call Barba|rians.
And if it please him,
so can he take down the pre|sent
pride of the Romane
Empire: which I especially
place in that man of sinne,
who is the veriest Emperour
of Rome; surmounting the
other in his owne opinion,
and in the opinion of his
Disciples, as much as the Sun
excelleth the Moone in glo|rie.
And therefore most
blasphemously this title is
ascribed to him, <HI>The King of
Kings, and the Lord of Lords.</HI>
But let vs remember, that
God himselfe saith, <HI>All the
Tyees of the Forrest shal know,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezek. 17. 24.</NOTE>
<HI>that I the Lord haue brought
downe the high Tree, haue ex|alted
the low Tree, haue dryed
<PB N="234" REF="122">
vp the greene Tree, and haue
made the dry Tree to flourish, I
the Lord haue spoken, and haue
done it.</HI> Wherfore let Israel
trust and hope in the Lord,
euen hope against hope, that
though they bee humbled e|uen
to the earth, and <HI>Pharaoh</HI>
mount vp with his pride to
heauen, and against heauen,
saying, <HI>who is the Lord?</HI> yet
the Lord will bring Israel
out of Egypt, and will tri|umph
ouer Egypt and <HI>Pha|raoh</HI>
with a mightie power,
and out-stretched arme: So
shall Israel say; <HI>Thy right
hand, O Lord, is become glo|rious
in power, thy right hand,
O Lord,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 15. 6. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> <HI>hath dashed in pieces
the Enemy. And in the great|nesse
of thine excellency thou
hast ouerthrowne them that
<PB N="235" REF="122">
rose vp against thee.</HI> Yea much
people in Heauen shall say:
<HI>Alleluia, Saluation and Glo|ry
and Honour and Power</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reu. 19. 1. 2.</NOTE> <HI>vn|to
the Lord our God, for true
and righteous are his iudge|ments:
for he hath iudged the
great whore, which did corrupt
the earth with her fornica|tion,
and hath auenged the
blood of his seruants at her
hand.</HI> And surely great glo|ry
must needs arise vnto God
both from heauen &amp; earth,
when God by his Church,
being low and little, iudgeth
the great Whore. Little and
weake things when they pro|duce
great effects, it plainely
appeares that they haue bor|rowed
power from else|where:
and from whom can
the creature borrow power,
<PB N="236" REF="123">
but of the Creator, the foun|tain
of power? whose weak|ness,
that is, whose least pow|er
being added to the crea|ture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 1. 25</NOTE>
is <HI>stronger than men,</HI> e|uen
than all the strength of
men. God and three hun|dred
are able to ouercome
an Host,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iudg. 6. &amp; 7.</NOTE> <HI>that are like Grashop|pers
for multitude:</HI> yea God
and Israel, onely by walking
about a towne, and fighting
with no other weapons but
Trumpets of Rams hornes,
can make the strength of Ie|richo
to fall before them.
God and a woman, euen <HI>De|borah,</HI>
can iudge Israel, and
deliuer them from a King
that hath nine hundred cha|riots
of Iron. But when by
weakenesse God ouercom|meth
strength, it cannot bee
<PB N="237" REF="123">
the strength of weakenesse
that ouercommeth, but the
strength of God. Therefore
all glorying here also is ex|cluded
from man, and re|ferred
vnto God. And ac|cordingly
<HI>Deborah</HI> rightly
giues God the glory, say|ing;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iudg. 5. 13.</NOTE>
<HI>The Lord made mee haue
dominion ouer the Mighty.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, God suffers his
Church to bee low and
weake, before hee exalt it,
in regard of Man. And first
we may take notice, that in
the lownesse of the Church
God hath an eye, and leuells
as it were at the very ene|mies
of the Church; which
are indeed his owne ene|mies.
For by the lownesse
&amp; weaknesse of the Church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iudg. 4. 7.</NOTE>
hee <HI>drawes</HI> out these ene|mies,
<PB N="238" REF="124">
vnto a full and finall
ouerthrow. Hee encoura|geth
and hardneth them to
a full aduenture in a warre
against God, that God may
fully bee auenged of them,
and fully triumph ouer
them. The Lord knoweth,
that the distressed estate of
the Church, doth engage
their enemies in great and
full prosecutions of them,
that so comming forth with
their whole forces to ouer|throw
the Church, their
whole forces may bee ouer|throwne.
The Lord him|selfe
sheweth vs this his di|spensation;
For hee profes|seth,
that therefore hee
brought Israel into straites,
betweene the Mountaines
and the Red Sea, because
<PB N="239" REF="124">
<HI>Pharaoh will say,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 14.</NOTE> <HI>they are in|tangled
in the Land, the wil|dernesse
hath shut them in.
And I will harden Pharaohs
heart</HI> (saith the Lord) <HI>that
hee shall follow after them, and
I will bee honoured vpon Pha|raoh,
and vpon all his host.</HI>
When the men of Israel
haue once beene smitten by
the men of Ai, and doe the
second time flee before
them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iosh. 8. 5. 6. 7.</NOTE> <HI>They will come out after
vs</HI> (saith <HI>Ioshua) till wee haue
drawne, (or pulled) them from
the City: Then shall yee rise
vp from the Ambush, and seize
vpon the Citie, for the Lord
your God hath deliuered it in|to
your hand.</HI> By this baite
of infirmity, doth God
draw his enemies to open
their mouthes to swallow
<PB N="240" REF="125">
the Church, but then the
hooke of Omnipotence that
lyeth hid vnder it, taketh
and killeth them. And euen
now in the distresse of Gods
Army wee see that done
which <HI>Iohn</HI> saw before
would bee done; <HI>I saw the
Beast,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reu. 19. 19. 20.</NOTE> <HI>and the Kings of the
earth, and their Armies ga|thered
together, to make war
against him that sate on the
horse, &amp; against his army.</HI> And
why should we not hope to
see that euent, which <HI>Iohn</HI>
also saw following this ga|thering
together? <HI>And the
Beast was taken, and with him
the false Prophet.</HI> A second
regard hath God to men in
this lownesse of the Church,
and that is a regard to the
Church it selfe. For when
<PB N="241" REF="125">
God doth prepare a glorious
victorie for his Church, his
Church must bee duely pre|pared
for the receiuing of
this victorie. And this low|nesse
doth diuersly prepare
her. First, it calls her to the
life of faith; to liue by faith,
and not by sight. For when
visible things faile her, then
is shee forced to run by faith
to things inuisible: when
that failes her which she sees,
then she cleares vp the eye of
faith, that she may haue some
euidence of things not seene.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 11.</NOTE>
So S^t. <HI>Paul</HI> saith of the wi|dow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Tim. 5&punc; 5.</NOTE>
that being <HI>desolate</HI> shee
<HI>trusteth in God.</HI> And as soon
as <HI>Iehosaphat</HI> hath said: <HI>Wee
haue no might against this
great company that commeth
against vs, neither know wee
<PB N="242" REF="126">
what to doe:</HI> it presently fol|lowes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Chro. 20. 12.</NOTE>
<HI>But our eyes are on
thee.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Cor. 1.</NOTE> And S^t. <HI>Paul</HI> hauing
receiued the sentence of
death, trusteth in God that
raiseth the dead. Thus when
the outward eye seeth no
helpe in the creature, the in|ward
eye of faith is awaked
to look only on the Creator.
And indeed nothing but
faith is fit to receiue a mira|culous
Mercie. When God
makes bare his Arme in some
great and wonderfull deliue|rance,
hee will haue his peo|ple
by faith to looke vp to
this arme, and wholly to de|pend
on it. Therfore Christ
Iesus, when he is ready to be|stow
a miraculous healing,
he vsually calleth for faith to
receiue it. And euen now
<PB N="243" REF="126">
by the distresse of the
Church, doth God call the
Church to this faith. And
no question if by this faith
we be duly prepared, for the
great worke of Gods mercy
in the deliuerance of the
Church, wee shall heare that
gratious answer which the
faithfull vsed to receiue: <HI>Goe
in peace, thy Faith hath saued
thee.</HI> Lastly, by the weake|nesse
of the Church God
calls the Church to Repen|tance,
and so prepareth her
for victorie. Hee calls her by
the fire of affliction from
drosfe to puritie, from wan|tonness
to the grace of God,
from the forme of godlinesse
to the power thereof. There
growes much drosse of Car|nalitie
about a Church in the
<PB N="244" REF="127">
time of ease, and men turne
the grace of God into wan|tonnesse.
There is wanton
liuing, &amp; wanton preaching,
and wanton hearing. Men
play with Religion, and are
not in earnest when they are
about religious things. Yea,
when they haue formally &amp;
falsly done religious things,
they fall heartily to things
of the world; the false pro|fession
of true Religion, be|ing
not much vnlike the pro|fession
of a false worship; the
consequence wherof is this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 32. 6.</NOTE>
<HI>The people sate downe to eate
and drinke, and rose vp to play.</HI>
But is such a Church fit for a
glorious and miraculous de|liuerance?
Can wee expect
that God should make bare
his arme to saue a Luxurious,
<PB N="245" REF="127">
a Gluttonous, a Drunken
Congregation: No, it must
bee purged from these, and
made white, before God wil
deliuer it, and crowne it with
victorie. Therefore <HI>by this</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Esa. 27. 9.</NOTE>
affliction <HI>shall the Iiniquitie
of Iacob be purged; and this is
all the fruite, to take away their
sinne.</HI> The Church is scoured
and purged by affliction, and
being purged then may shee
heare,<NOTE PLACE="marg">vers. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> <HI>Hath hee smitten him,
as hee smote those that smote
him? or is hee slaine according
to the slaughter of them that
are slaine by him?</HI> For the
Iudgement that begins with
the house of God but as a
fiery triall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Pet. 4. 12. 17.</NOTE> shall end with the
sinners and vnrighteous like
a consuming fire. When the
first appeareth more pure &amp;
<PB N="246" REF="128">
glorious, the second shall not
appeare at all. Wherefore
if wee by our Corrections,
the Church of France by her
late Chastisements, and Ger|many
by her present Scour|gings,
would turn to him that
smites them, by turning
from their sins to his righte|ousnesse,
surely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 112.</NOTE> <HI>to the righ|teous
light should arise in the
midst of darknes.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Esa 32. 17</NOTE> For <HI>the work
of Righteousnes shall be peace,
and the effect of Righteousnes
quietness &amp; assurance for euer.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Esa. 33. 1.</NOTE>
And then withall followes a
<HI>Woe to thee that spoylest, and
thou wast not spoyled; when
thou shalt cease to spoile, thou
shalt be spoiled.</HI> Let God then
haue of his Church the end
of his chastisements, euen
true, spirituall and sincere ho|linesse,
<PB N="247" REF="128">
and then the chastise|ments
of his Church will
end. But then will he begin
with the enemies of his
Church: hee will awake as a
Gyant refreshed with wine.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 2. 5.</NOTE>
<HI>Hee shall speake to them in his
wrath, and vexe them in his
sore displeasure:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Esa. 41. 12.</NOTE> <HI>Thou shalt seek
them, and thou shalt not finde
them, euen them that conten|ded
with thee: They that war
against thee shall be as nothing,
and as a thing of naught.</HI> And
thus while the Church by
her lownesse is brought to
puritie, puritie brings her to
victorie.</P>
