<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT
Noble Lord, Iohn, Earle of
Montrose, Lord Graeme and Mug|dok,
one of his Maiesties
most Honourable Priuy
Counsell in this
Kingdome.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Haue beene bold to pub|lish
these Treatises, vn|der
your Honourable
name, not for any light,
that by them can accresse to that trea|sure
of knowledge, which is in your
Noble minde, but that (so farre as I
can) I might make euident to others,
for imitation, that grace which
<PB REF="3">
God hath made so eminent in you.</P>
<P>I may truely say, there is no qua|litie,
which in the iudgement either
of learned Ancients, or recents, hath
beene required, to complete Nobili|tie,
lacking in you. Your honour
being not <GAP DESC="foreign"> onely, Noble by
birth; but <GAP DESC="foreign"> also, generous by
manners, such as retaine, yea, by ver|tue
encreases, the honour of your ho|nourable
Fathers. It passed among
the ancient wise men in a prouerbe,
<GAP DESC="foreign">: be|cause
commonly it fals out, that chil|dren
of worthy men, comming short
of their fathers vertue, derogates to
their glorie: <HI>aequat rara patrem soboles:</HI>
And therefore in them <HI>qui clariores
genere cens<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ntur,</HI> it was euer thought
an high commendation, <HI>maiorum fa|mam
sustinere;</HI> like as no greater shame
can be to them of that ranke, then
when by their ignoble life, they
quench the light of their noble stock,
<HI>et generi suo dedecori sunt.</HI></P>
<P>It is now twelue hundreth years
<PB REF="3">
since your honourable name hath
beene famous in this kingdome: but
which is much more, and wherein,
in my iudgement, it is marueilous,
the first mention of your Tribe, in the
story, doth not record the rising ther|of
from a small estate vnto an high|er,
as it doth in many Peeres of the
land, who for their vertue also were
aduanced; but at the first sight, it pre|sents
your worthy Predecessor stand|ing
in the highest top of Honour,
wherein a subiect can be: for not one|ly
was he then brother in law to king
<HI>Fergus</HI> the 2. but for his Wisedome,
Valour, &amp; Manhood, by consent of
the Nobles, both Scots &amp; Picts, then
gathered to battell, he was chosen, as
meetest Chieftaine, to demolish that
diuision-wall of <HI>Abircorne,</HI> stretching
from the East sea, to the West, built
first by <HI>Victorine,</HI> and fortified there|after,
more strongly, by <HI>Gallio,</HI> both of
them Romane Lieutenants; but more
victoriously, first &amp; last, broken down
by the valiant <HI>Graeme,</HI> in presence
<PB REF="4">
of both the Kings, that so a way might
be prepared to their armies, to make
irruption vpon the Romans, for
which, vnto this day, the remanents of
that worke, beares the name of <HI>Graeme</HI>
his ditch, when himselfe is gone.
<HI>Facta ducis viuunt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ouid.</NOTE> operosaqu&egrave; gloria re|rum.
Haec manet.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, there are many honour|rable
families in this land, who com|municate
with you in the same name:
but that this is the honour of your
house, is euident, not onely by the
lands, bordering with that wall, pos|sessed
as yet by your L. and was, as
the story recordeth, one of the mo|tiues
why that waighty charge was
committed to your worthy ancestors;
but in this also that the remanant fa|milies,
who come vnder the commu|nion
of the same name, hold lands
of your house, from which, as from
a most ancient stocke, they as sproutes
and branches, haue growne and
sprung out.</P>
<P>And of this, as it is euident, that
<PB REF="4">
your honourable house is more anci|ent
then the Chronicle can declare,
so doth this greatly increase the glo|ry
of it, that it hath continued in ho|nour
euer since, euen to the daies of
your noble Father of famous memo|ry,
who for fidelitie to his Prince, loue
to his Countrey, equity toward all
men, after he had borne many other
offices of honour, was in his olde
age honored to be his Maiesties high
Commissioner, and also great Chan|cellor
of this kingdome: his house
like the open court of <HI>Ahasuerus</HI> his
palace, wherein hee banquetted his
people, euer plenished&punc; and patent to
such, as pleased to resort.</P>
<P>In a word, no lesse honourable in this
Kingdome hath your Familie beene,
then the Tribes either of <HI>Leontis,</HI> or
<HI>Aeantis,</HI> among the Athenians, for
their feates of armes, and glorious vi|ctories
atchieued in battell; or among
the Romanes, these fiue principall fa|milies,
<HI>Vitellij, Fabij, Antonij, Potitij,
Mamilij,</HI> who for their most ancient
<PB REF="5">
discent, were called <HI>Aborigines.</HI></P>
<P>But howsoeuer these be great
things, yet are they not the greatest,
which doe commend you, <HI>Virtute de|cet,
non sanguine niti.</HI> It is a miserable
pouertie, where a man hath no mat|ter
of praise in himselfe, but must bor|row
it from others.</P>
<Q>Miserum est aliorum incumbere famae.</Q>
<P>Yea, the more honourable the pa|rentage
is, the greater is the shame
of him that degenerates from it, and
so becomes <HI>indignus genere.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Perit omnis in illo</L>
<L>Gentis hono<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ouid.</NOTE> cuius laus est in origine sola.</L></Q>
<P>Here then is your greatest praise,
that as you are, <GAP DESC="foreign">,
lineally discended
of so Noble, and ancient, a stocke (for
no writ, nor memory of man, can re|cord
the interruption of your Line) so
are you the vndoubted heyre of those
vertues, which shined in them, <HI>Wise|dome,</HI>
declared in doubtsome and diffi|cult
matters: <HI>Manhood,</HI> tryed, as we
<PB REF="5">
say, in <HI>discrimine: Truth, fit enim quod
dicitur,</HI> your words are sufficient war|rants
to such, as know you. <HI>Noble
manners: Veram nobilitatem testantur
facies &amp; mores:</HI> these are <HI>Insignia numi|na
diuum.</HI></P>
<P>And beside these, beautified with
other two rare graces, wherunto they,
in regard of their times, could not at|tain,
at least, in the like measure, <HI>Pietie</HI>
and <HI>Erudition:</HI> your honour being
learned, not onely in the common
languages of the most famous coun|tries
of Europe, but in the three most
renowned languages, whereby <UNCLEAR>as</UNCLEAR> yee
haue attained to the knowledge of li|berall
Sciences, so doe ye stil conserue
and dayly encrease it, by diligent rea|ding,
and conference with the lear|ned:
who for learning are loued, and
honoured by you:
<Q><L>Nam quae mox imitere legis nec des<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">nit vnquam,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Claudian.</NOTE></L>
<L>Tecu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1+ letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1+ letters">rataloqui, Tecum Romana vetustas.</L></Q></P>
<P>That which the wise K. <HI>Salomon</HI> said
of Beauty without discretion, the like
may be said of <HI>Honour</HI> without Eru|dition;
<PB REF="6">
It is as a ring in a swynes snout:
and therefore hath the learned, ex|pressed
<HI>Erudition,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aul. Gal.</NOTE> by the name of hu|manitie,
both because the care and stu|dy
of Sciences, is committed to man
onely, among all the creatures, and
for that man without Erudition, is li|ker
a beast, then a man. <HI>Turpe est vi|ro
principi parem dignitatisuae virtutem
non afferre.</HI></P>
<P>And these two, <HI>Honour,</HI> and <HI>Eruditi|on,</HI>
shine so much the more cleerely in
you, that they are both crowned with
singular and vnsimulate Pietie, both
professed, and practised, and that in a
time of reu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">lting, &amp; great defection:
yea, in most dangerous places, euen
there where Sathan hath his throne:
for this is no small argument of true
religion, deepely rooted in your
heart, that hauing trauelled through
<HI>Italy, Rome,</HI> and other parts of the
Popes Dominions, heard, and seene
all those allurements, which carrieth
away instable minded men, not roo|ted,
nor grounded in Christ, after
<PB REF="6">
the loue of that richly busked Babi|lonish
Whoore, your Lordship hath
returned home vnspotted, neither
burnt with their fire, nor blacked
with their smoake: not vnlike those
three children, who came forth out
of <HI>Nabuchadnezzars</HI> fire, and had not
so much as a smell thereof on their
garments.</P>
<P>This Pietie, euen in the iudge|ment
of them, who had no more but
Natures light, was esteemed the high|est
matter of a mans praise, <HI>maiorem
virtutem religione,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato in Epino.</NOTE> &amp; pietate in Deum,
nullam in humano genere inueniri quis|que
sibi persuadeat.</HI> The reason here|of
is giuen by Diuines, illuminate with
the light of the word, to be this, that
by Pietie, and holinesse of life, we as|cend
<HI>ad primarium illud bonum vnde
originem traximus:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nazian. Orat. 33. in laud. Hiero.</NOTE> and therefore the
same father speaking in the praise of
<HI>Cyprian,</HI> affirmes, <GAP DESC="foreign">.
And indeede, since we are the genera|tion
<PB REF="7">
of God made, to his image, what
greater glory can man haue then to
conserue that image, and be like vn|to
him, to whose similitude hee was
made? <HI>Vna itaque nobilitas imitatio
dei.</HI></P>
<P>Goe on therfore right Noble Lord,
follow the course, which yee haue
happily begunne; shew your selfe the
kindely sonne of so worthy Fathers:
aboue all, the Sonne of God, by the
new generation; his worke-manship
created in Christ Iesus vnto good
workes. Keepe in minde that warning
of our Lord, <HI>Much will be required of
him, to whom much is giuen:</HI> as the
double portion obliged the first
borne to the greater seruice, other|waies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chrisost.</NOTE>
<GAP DESC="foreign">. In all your waies looke vp
to the Lord, hee it is, that <HI>exalts them
of lowe degree,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 1. 52.</NOTE> and puts downe the
mighty from their seates,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hos. 4. 7.</NOTE> turning their
glory into shame, who vse not their glo|ry
to honour him.</HI></P>
<P>Pittifull proofes whereof wee haue
<PB REF="7">
in this fearefull earthquake (as I may
call it) going through this countrey,
by which many Castles, Houses, and
Lands, spewes out their inhabitants,
shaking off the yoke of their ancient
Lords, and rendring themselues to be
possessed of their seruants, because
they haue also cast off the yoke of the
Lord their God, or at least not wel|commed
his grace, offred in the Gos|pell,
as it became them. The consi|deration
whereof, I doubt not, doth
affect your Lordship, as it doth others
who are become wise through the
feare of God, and learnes by the losse
of others to gather their thoughts,
and make peace with him, whose
praise it is, that he buildes houses to
men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 2.</NOTE> and vpholds them: <HI>for by him
enterprises are established.</HI></P>
<P>And herewithall remember Right
Noble Lord, that as trees, on tops of
hils, are subiect to the blast of euery
winde, so men in the height of ho|nour

which they haue neede to be armed.</P>
<P><PB REF="8">
But least I seeme <HI>Monere memo|rem,</HI>
<GAP DESC="foreign">,
more laborious then neede requires,
I end: Humbly praying your Lordship
to accept these small, and scarse-ripe
fruit of my labours, as a testimony

<HEAD>The Preface.</HEAD>
<P>_IT may iustly be spoken of
many in this age, which
the Apostle Saint <HI>Paul</HI>
spake of the Hebrewes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 5. 12.</NOTE>
<HI>When, as concerning the time,
yee ought to be teachers of o|thers,
yee haue neede againe that
wee teach you the first principles
of the word of God, and are be|come
such, as haue neede of
Milke, and not of strong meate:</HI>
they professe faith in Christ, but in
truth doe not beleeue in him, nei|ther
yet can they, because they know
him not: they are baptised in his
name, but are not bureid with him
<PB REF="9">
through Baptisme, neither raised
vp together, through the faith of
the operation of God, that raised
him from the dead: they carrie his
cognisance and badge, but are not
militant vnder him in his warre|fare.</P>
<P>As the Athenians sacrificed, <HI>Ig|noto
Deo,</HI> to a strange God, and the
Samaritans worshipped that, which
they knew not; so our Atheists,
<HI>profitentur ignotum Christum,</HI>
professe a strange Christ: they know
not what he is in himselfe, nor how
hee is become ours, nor what hee
hath done for vs: and therefore
neither in life, nor death, doe they
expresse his vertue. They liue licen|tiously,
<HI>reprobate vnto euery
good worke,</HI> dishonouring Christ,
as if hee were a Sauiour who
had no power to sanctifie those
which are in him; and they dye
<PB REF="9">
without comfort, as if Christ by
death had not obtained life, and by
death did not transport to life, all
that are in him; thus while they
professe fellowship with him, they
declare themselues to be strangers
from him.</P>
<P>It is witnessed by the Lord, in
<HI>Ezechiel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezech. 18. 20.</NOTE> the same soule that sin|neth
shall die: the sonne shall not
beare the inquitie of the father,
neither shall the father beare the
iniquitie of the sonne, but the
righteousnesse of the righteous
shalbe vpon him, and the wic|kednesse
of the wicked shalbe vp|on
himselfe.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A question good to waken drousie Christians out of their dead security.</NOTE> If according to this
testimonie of the word, it be deman|ded
of them, seeing Christ is holy,
and righteous, and wee are the sin|ners,
how is it that hee is punished
and wee are spared? This is but one
of the least of Sathans assaults, by
<PB REF="10">
which he impugnes the faith of men,
and yet if they be required to an|swere
it, they shall soone bewray
themselues to be voide of know|ledge
and solide faith, confident one|ly
in a naked profession, which will
not faile in the end to beguile them.
For as an house faultie in the foun|dation
cannot abide the stormy
windes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 7.</NOTE> and raine, no more can a
Christian not informed with know|ledge,
not rooted, grounded, and
builded in Christ Iesus, by faith,
endure in the houre of tentation.</P>
<P>That therefore the doctrine of
Christianitie may be learned by such
as knowes it not,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The do|ctrine of Christia|nitie com|prised in three arti|cles, col|lected out of his Ge|nealogie, Baptisme, and Ten|tation.</NOTE> from the very
foundation, we haue here proposed
three most necessary points to be
entreated: The first, is Christs Ge|nealogie:
the second, his Baptisme:
the third, his Tentation. In the
first, wee are taught what manner
<PB REF="10">
of man our Lord is in himselfe. In
the second, what manner of way he
is become ours. In the third, what
manner of way he did begin to worke
the worke of our Redemption: all
most necessary to be knowne, for the
right grounding of our Faith on <MILESTONE N="1">
him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first is to know that Iesus the sonne of <HI>Mary,</HI> is that pro|mised <HI>Mes|siah.</HI></NOTE> In his Genealogie wee see how
Iesus, the sonne of <HI>Mary,</HI> is that
same blessed seede of the woman,
whom the Lord promised in Para|dise,
to whom the Prophets, of all
times, pointed, and for whom the
godly fathers of all ages waited, and
expected, lineally desended from
<HI>Adam,</HI> by seauentie and foure fa|thers.<MILESTONE N="2">
In his Baptisme wee see how
he was consecrated,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The se|cond tea|cheth vs what man|ner of way he is be|come ours.</NOTE> and ordained, in
most solemne manner, to doe the
office of the <HI>Mesias,</HI> that is, of an
anointed King, Preist, and Prophet,
for our Saluation, so that he is now
no more a priuate man but a pub|like,
<PB REF="11">
by most sure authoritie, and
in most solemne manner, become our
<MILESTONE N="3"> head and redeemer.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The third, how hee hath done the worke of a Redee|mer.</NOTE> And in his
temtation we see how immediately
after his ordination, he encounters
with Sathan in a singular combat,
ouercomming him in the wilder|nesse,
who before had ouercome our
parents in paradise: and so by his
first deed after his consecration,
makes it manifest that he was come
to destroy the workes of the Diuell.<NOTE PLACE="marg">These three ioy|ned toge|ther make vp a com|pleat do|ctrine of Christi|anitie.</NOTE></P>
<P>If these three be ioyned together
in one, wee shall finde them making
vp vnto vs a compleat doctrine of
Christian consolation. The Lord Ie|sus,
in regard of his diuine nature,
is called by the Prophet <HI>Zachary,
Gnamith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zach. 13. 7.</NOTE> Iehoua,</HI> that is, the fel|low
and companion of <HI>Iehoua,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">&rindx;</NOTE> or
as Saint <HI>Paul</HI> expounds it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn 2. 6.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="foreign">,
equall with God. In regard a|gaine
of his humaine nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob 19. 25.</NOTE> <HI>Iob</HI>
<PB REF="11">
calleth him <HI>Goel,</HI> my kinsman. In
regard of his vnited natures, he is
called by <HI>Esay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Esa. 8. 8.</NOTE> Emanuel,</HI> God with
vs.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nomb. 3 5.</NOTE> Now we know that by the law he
who was neerest kinsman,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How Christ be|ing his fa|thers equal and our kinsman is properly the true auenger and redee|mer of his brethren.</NOTE> had power
to reuenge the blood of his brother
vpon the Murtherer, if hee had
found him without a Citie of re|fuge;
and therefore was he stiled by
the name of an auenger, and like|wise
hee had power to redeeme the
inheritance which his brother,
through pouertie, had lost: for the
word <HI>Gaal,</HI> from which <HI>Goel</HI> com|meth,
hath in it these two prin|cipall
significations, to <HI>redeeme,</HI> and
to <HI>reuenge;</HI> So that heere wee see
how the Lord Iesus, being neerest
of kinne vnto vs, as wee may see out
of his Genealogie, being likewise
clad with the power of a redeemer
and reuenger, as wee shall learne
out of his Baptisme, commeth im|mediately
<PB REF="12">
after his entrie to the pub|licke
Office of the Messias, vpon
Sathan that murtherer, and find|ing
him out of a Citie of re|fuge,
enters into combat with him,
to reuenge the blood of his Bre|thren,
and to redeeme the inheri|tance
which they had foolishly sould
for nothing: yea moreouer he doth
that which no tipicall <HI>Goel</HI> vnder
the <HI>Law,</HI> was able to doe; for not
onely doth hee ouerthrow the
murtherer, but restoreth
life againe to his bre|thren
that were
slaine and mur|thred
by
him.</P>

Christ Iesus; the other, how by
that same <HI>Word</HI> incarnate, wee
assend, and returne to God againe.
We are of him by Christ, Crea|tor,
as his creatures, or sonnes, by
our first creation: we goe to him
by Christ, Redeemer, as his new
creatures, or his sonnes, by rege|neration:
the first of these is
common to all men, the second
proper to those onely who are of
Christs spirituall kindred: and
the praise of this communion
betweene God and man, is to be
reserued to CHRIST Iesus onely:
for it is no lesse absurditie to say
that wee can goe to GOD the
Father, by any other then Christ,
then if it should be said also, that
wee came of God the Father by
<PB N="5" REF="15">
another then Christ.</P>
<P>But now for orders sake,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The whole Ge|nealogie diuided in|to fiue Sections.</NOTE> wee
will diuide the whole Genealogie
into fiue sections; reckoning as
Saint <HI>Mathew</HI> doth, from the Fa|thers
to the Children, for the
better help of our memories: the
first is from <HI>Adam</HI> to <HI>Noah;</HI> the
second from <HI>Noah</HI> to <HI>Abraham;</HI>
the third from <HI>Abraham</HI> to <HI>Da|uid;</HI>
the fourth from <HI>Dauid</HI> to <HI>Zo|robabel;</HI>
the fifth from <HI>Zorobabel</HI>
vnto <HI>Iesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>In the first and second,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The diffe|rent cour|ses of the two Euan|gelists.</NOTE> from
<HI>Adam</HI> to <HI>Abraham,</HI> Saint <HI>Luke</HI>
runnes him alone. In the third,
from <HI>Abraham</HI> to <HI>Dauid,</HI> Saint
<HI>Mathew</HI> and <HI>Luke</HI> runne toge|ther.
In the fourth, from <HI>Dauid</HI>
to <HI>Zorobabel,</HI> they take different
courses: for where Saint <HI>Mathew</HI>
goes downe, from <HI>Dauid</HI> by <HI>Sa|lomon,</HI>
Saint <HI>Luke</HI> followes the
<PB N="6" REF="16">
line from <HI>Dauid</HI> by <HI>Nathan,</HI> and
both of them meets in <HI>Salathiel;</HI>
where going on two steps toge|ther,
they part againe, and the
one takes his course from <HI>Zoro|babel</HI>
by <HI>Rhesa,</HI> to <HI>Mary;</HI> the other
from <HI>Zorobabel</HI> by <HI>Abiud,</HI> to <HI>Io|seph:</HI>
and in the end both of them
meetes againe in Christ Iesus: the
reason of which diuersitie, will ap|peare
God willing, in handling
the seuerall sections thereof.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first section is of ten fa|thers, from <HI>Adam</HI> to <HI>Noah.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>The first then is from <HI>Adam</HI> to
<HI>Noah,</HI> contayning ten Fathers, <HI>A|dam,
Seth, Enosh, Kenan, Mahalaleel,
Iared, Henoch, Methusalem, Lamech,
Noah.</HI> Here, as I said, Saint <HI>Luke</HI>
reckons him alone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why these are recko|ned by Saint <HI>Luke,</HI> and not by Saint <HI>Mathew.</HI></NOTE> where Saint
<HI>Mathew</HI> goes no higher, then <HI>A|braham:</HI>
the reason of this diuer|sitie
is, that Saint <HI>Mathew,</HI> in wri|ting,
had a special respect to moue
the Iewes to embrace the Gospell,
<PB N="7" REF="16">
and therefore beginnes it in a
manner most plausible to them:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why these are recko|ned by Saint <HI>Luke,</HI> and not by Saint <HI>Ma|thew.</HI></NOTE>
<HI>The booke of the generation of Ie|sus
Christ, the sonne of Dauid, the
sonne of Abraham;</HI> because it was
then most commonly in the
mouthes of all men, that the <HI>Me|siah</HI>
should be the sonne of <HI>Dauid.</HI>
But Saint <HI>Luke</HI> being, as testifies
<HI>Eusebius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Colos. 4. 14.</NOTE> by birth a Gentile,
borne in Antiochia, learned in
medicine, and now a proselite
conuerted himselfe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saint <HI>Ma|thew</HI> tea|cheth that the Saui|our is to be sought in <HI>Abra|hams</HI> house, Saint <HI>Luke</HI> shews that he is also a Sauiour of the Gen|tiles.</NOTE> hee writes
his Gospell to conuert others:
wherein especially, for the com|fort
of beleeuing Gentiles, hee
drawes the line of Christ, by twen|tie
degrees, higher then doth
Saint <HI>Mathew,</HI> the one teaching
vs to seeke the SAVIOVR of the
world in the linage of <HI>Abraham,</HI>
and <HI>DAVID,</HI> the other againe
teaching, how all beleeuing peo|ple
<PB N="8" REF="17">
hath their interest in Christ,
not they who are of <HI>Abrahams</HI> po|steritie
onely, but they, who are
of <HI>Adams</HI> also.</P>
<P>In this section wee marke no
particular,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Adam</HI> the first sonne of God, among men, and the first fa|ther of Christ ac|cording to the flesh.</NOTE> but this one, that the
first father of Christ according to
the flesh, reckoned in this Gene|alogie,
<HI>Adam,</HI> is called the sonne
of God, to wit, both by creation,
and regeneration: for in it, wee
haue manifold comforts discoue|red
vnto vs, if wee conioyne the
end of this Genealogie with the
beginning. For in the beginning
thereof wee see that the first <HI>A|dam</HI>
is the sonne of God, and the
same by diuine dispensation; the
the first father of Christ accor|ding
to the flesh, and so as <HI>Euthy|mius</HI>
said of <HI>Dauid,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Euthym. praef.</HI> in Psalmos.</NOTE> he is, <HI>et deifili|us,
&amp; pater dei.</HI> In the end of it
againe wee see, how Christ the
<PB N="9" REF="17">
son of God, doth also become the
sonne of man. A marueilous di|spensation,
that man made by
God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What a comfor|table vni|on be|tweene God and man is made by Christ Ie|sus.</NOTE> should become a father to
Christ, who being very GOD,
would also be made the sonne of
man, that by him men might be
made the sonnes of GOD. See
what a binding corner-stone the
Lord Iesus is, knitting together
not man with man onely, Gen|tiles
with Iewes, but man with
God also, and that not by a per|sonall
vnion onely, which hee
hath perfected in himselfe, but by
a spirituall vnion also, by which
he vnites all the members of his
misticall body in a blessed peace
and fellowship with God: and
this hath hee now begun, and
shall perfect in the end.</P>
<P>O what a comfort is heere!<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zach. 13. 7.</NOTE>
that <HI>Gnamith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Esa. 8. 8.</NOTE> Iehoua,</HI> the fellow,
<PB N="10" REF="18">

neerest to vs of flesh and blood,
clad with power and might from
God, to reuenge our blood, to re|deeme
our life, to restore our lost
inheritance Where shall we finde
such ioyfull tydings as these
are? We read that vnder the <HI>Law,</HI>
the Lord came downe to Mount
Sinai,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 19.</NOTE> and <HI>Moses</HI> went vp; a great
fauour indeed, that the Maiestie
of God should come downe to
visite his owne creature, and
should honour man, by keeping
dyet to speake with him in so
homely a manner. But vnder the
GOSPELL, in a more fauourable
manner the Lord shews himselfe
familiar with men, for not onely
<PB N="11" REF="18">
doe his holy Angels ioyne in
company with shepheards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 2. 9.</NOTE> but
himselfe becomes the sonne of
man, walking among men, to mak
men the sonnes of God.<NOTE PLACE="marg">How wee should be thankefull for so great a mercy.</NOTE> Let vs
meditate vpon this mercy, that
howsoeuer wee be not able to
conceiue the greatnesse thereof,
yet at least wee may grow in
thankfulnesse to our God for it:
he came to seeke vs, hee found vs
imprisoned, bound with the fet|ters
of our sinnes, hee hath loosed
our bands, gone vp againe be|fore
vs, and bidden vs follow him,
worthy are wee of double shame,
and confusion, and that our se|cond
woe should be worse then
our first, if wee will not arise to
make hast and follow him. The
sinnes done against the Law may
be cured by the grace of the
Gospell, but if the grace offered
<PB N="12" REF="19">
in the Gospel be despised, re|maines
there any other sacrifice
for sinne?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 10. 27.</NOTE> None at all, <HI>but a fear|full
looking for of iudgement, and
violent fire.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The arti|cle of Christs In|carnation confirmed.</NOTE></P>
<P>Beside this, we are here confir|med
in two other notable points
of Christian religion, the one is,
of Christs marueilous Incarnati|on,
by which hee became the
sonne of man, the other is
of our supernaturall Adoption,
whereby wee become the sonnes
of God. Wee beleeue that our
first father <HI>Adam</HI> was a very na|turall
man, yet neither gotten of
a man, nor borne of a woman, but
formed immediatly by the hand
of God, and that of the earth,
being as yet a virgin (so to call
it with <HI>Ireneus</HI>) for neither had
the Lord rayned vpon it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iren. lib. 3. Cap. 31.</NOTE> neither
had the hand of man tilled, or
<PB N="13" REF="19">
laboured it:<NOTE PLACE="marg">And that by a com|parison taken from the creati|on of <HI>A|dam</HI> and <HI>Euah.</HI></NOTE> as likewise wee be|leeue
that <HI>Euah</HI> was a naturall
woman, yet neither begotten by
a man, nor borne of a woman,
but formed of <HI>Adams</HI> rib, imme|diately
by God. Why then will we
doubt that Christ was made a
very naturall man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">&lindx;</NOTE> yet not begot|ten
by man, but formed of <HI>Dauids</HI>
seede in the virgins wombe, by
the immediate operation of the
holy Ghost? Indeed if the first <HI>A|dam</HI>
had beene begotten of the
seede of man, it might probably
haue beene thought that the se|cond
<HI>Adam</HI> was begotten of <HI>Io|seph,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">How the second <HI>A|dam</HI> hath with the first the same simi|litude of generati|on.</NOTE>
but seeing the first <HI>Adam</HI>
was formed of the earth, by the
hand of God immediately, it was
also conuenient, that the second
<HI>Adam,</HI> who was to bring home
man againe to GOD, should be
made man by the hand of God,
<PB N="14" REF="20">
without the operation of man,
that so the second <HI>Adam,</HI> might
haue with the first <GAP DESC="foreign">,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theodoret. Dialog. 1. Cap. 18.</NOTE>
the same simili|tude
and likenesse of generation.</P>
<P>The other point,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our spiri|tuall A|doption is here also confirmed.</NOTE> wherein here
wee are confirmed, is of our owne
supernaturall Adoption: wee see
that the sonne of God is become
the sonne of man; the sonne of
<HI>Dauid;</HI> of <HI>Abraham;</HI> of <HI>Adam;</HI>
and why then will wee not (saith
Chrisostome) be strengthned in
the faith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">&rindx;</NOTE> to giue glory to God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For seeing we see that God is be|come the sonne of man, why shall wee thinke it impossible that man may be|come the the sonne of God?</NOTE>
by beleeuing that the sonnes of
<HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Abraham,</HI> following
the Adoption, shall also be made
the sonnes of God? surely in mans
iudgement, it seemes more im|possible
that God should become
Man, should walke on earth, in
the shape of a Seruant, and suf|fer
the ignominious death of the
<PB N="15" REF="20">
Crosse, then that man should be
exalted vnto heauen, and crowned
with glory; yet the first of these
we see done, and wee beleeue it,
why then shall wee any more
doubt of the second?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chrisost. <HI>in</HI> Math. Hom. 2.</NOTE> especially
seeing it was not in vaine, and for
nothing, that the God fo glory
humbled himselfe vnto so base
an estate: No, no but that from
our basenesse he might raise vs vp
into his glory.</P>
<P>The second section of this Ge|nealogie
is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The se|cond secti|on is of o|ther tenne Fathers, from <HI>Noah</HI> to <HI>Abra|ham.</HI></NOTE> from <HI>Noah</HI> to <HI>Abra|ham</HI>
by other tenne Fathers, <HI>Sem,
Arphaxad, Sale, Heber, Peleg, Re|gu,
Sarug, Nahor, Terah</HI> and <HI>Abra|ham.</HI>
In this, wee obserue no
thing, but that of <HI>Noah</HI> his three
sonnes <HI>Iaphet, Sem,</HI> and <HI>Cham,</HI>
from whom all mankind are des|cended,
the Lord makes choise
of the second, <HI>Sem,</HI> to be the fa|ther
<PB N="16" REF="21">
of Christ, according to the
flesh; and where <HI>Sem</HI> also had
many sonnes, hee passes by them
all, and makes choise of <HI>Arphaxad,</HI>
and so contracting his promises
into narrower bounds, he makes
vp the couenant with the He|brews,
and is content to be named
the God of <HI>Sem,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 9. 26.</NOTE> which is the
first time, that euer we read God
to haue beene called the God of
one man more then of another.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Comfort against this that <HI>Iaphet</HI> our father is not in the rolle of Christs fa|thers.</NOTE></P>
<P>Where, least of our weaknesse,
wee should faint, and be discou|raged,
when we heare that <HI>Iaphet</HI>
our father, of whom wee are des|cended,
is not in the line of
Christs parents, let vs remenber
that promise which God made
to <HI>Iaphet,</HI> and his posteritie, at
the same time that he entred
into couenant with the house of
<HI>Sem,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 9. 27.</NOTE> and wee shalbe comforted:
<PB N="17" REF="21">
for then the Lord promised that
hee should perswade <HI>Iaphet</HI> to
dwell in the tents of <HI>Sem,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">It is suf|ficient that when <HI>Sem</HI> was chosen to be Christs father, it was also promised to <HI>Iaphet</HI> that hee should haue his part in Christ.</NOTE> that is,
in most louing manner he should
allure the posteritie of <HI>Iaphet</HI> to
embrace the couenant made
with the house of <HI>Sem;</HI> like as at
this day, praised be God, he hath
performed. <HI>For now partly obsti|nacie
is come to Israel, till the ful|nesse
of the gentiles come in.</HI> Six|teene
hundreth yeares did the
Lord dwell in the house of <HI>Sem,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 11. 25.</NOTE>
and now other 1600 yeares
hath he dwelt in the house of <HI>Ia|phet;</HI>
going through the seuerall
families thereof: among whom
hee hath also visited vs in these
ends of the earth, his holy Name
againe be blessed therefore for e|uer:
for now wee see that vnto vs
no lesse then to them appertai|neth
the promises of Mercie, and
<PB N="18" REF="22">
couenant of Grace.</P>
<P>And therefore though our pa|rents
be not among the progeni|tors
of Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Though Christ be not come of vs ac+cording to the flesh, yet if wee be come of him by grace, we haue com|fort inough.</NOTE> according to the
flesh, for that is the priuiledge of
our elder brethren the Iewes, that
theirs are the fathers of whom
Christ is come, according to the
flesh, yet let vs endeuour to make
sure this comfort to our selues that
we are come of him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 9. 5.</NOTE> according to
the spirit, &amp; grace of regeneration.
When that woman in the gospell
cried out after our Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk 11. 27.</NOTE> <HI>Blessed is
the wombe that bare thee, and the
papps which gaue thee sucke,</HI> she re|ceiued
this answere from him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 12. 47.</NOTE> <HI>yea,
rather blessed are they that heare the
word of God and keepe it.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">For the Lord Iesus hath al|wayes e|steemed&punc; most of the spiritu|al kindred.</NOTE> And when
againe one told him, <HI>behold thy
Mother, and thy Brethren stand
without, desiring to speake with thee,</HI>
he answered, <HI>who is my Mother, and
<PB N="19" REF="22">
who are my Brethren? &amp; he stretch|ed
out his hand, toward his Disciples,
and said, behold my Mother, and my
Brethren.</HI> Now it is knowne that
many of his Disciples were not his
kinsmen, according to the flesh,
but to remoue all scruple, and
to shew how much hee esteemes
of the spirituall kindred, he sub|ioynes,
<HI>For who soeuer shall doe
my fathers will, who is in heauen,
the same is my Brother, and Sister,
and Mother.</HI></P>
<P>It is true indeede all Christs
progenitors were blessed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wherein did the greatest happinesse of our Lords pro|genitors consist? See the Rhemists marginall Notes on <HI>Luk.</HI> 11. 28. out of <HI>Beda+tract. 19. in Ioan.</HI></NOTE> being
honoured by him, and endued
with faith by his grace (teaching
by the way) all children to com|municate
the best things they
haue vnto their parents, yet is it
true of them all, which <HI>Beda</HI> cited,
by the <HI>Rhemists</HI> themselues, said,
of the Virgin <HI>Mary, She was bles|sed
<PB N="20" REF="23">
indeede in that she was the tem|por
all meane and minister of the

in that she continued the perpe|tuall
keeper of his word:</HI> that is,
blessed indeede in that she was
the mother of our Lord, and
conceaued him in her wombe,
but much more blessed for con|ceauing
him in her heart by
faith.</P>
<P>Then our instruction is, that
though neither our names, nor
our Fathers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">&rindx;</NOTE> be in the catalogue
of Christs progenitors, yet if we
be in the roll of his children and
brethren wee shall haue comfort
sufficient: though hee be not
come of vs according to the
flesh, if wee be come from him,
according to the spirit, as his
sonnes, and daughters by rege|neration,
wee shalbe blessed in
<PB N="21" REF="23">
him, euen as they were.</P>
<P>The third section containes
the roll of Fathers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The third section is of foure|teene Fa|thers, from <HI>Abraham</HI> to <HI>Dauid.</HI></NOTE> from <HI>Abra|ham</HI>

<HI>Abraham, Isaac, Iacob, Iuda,
Phares, Esrom, Aram, Aminadab,
Naasson, Salmon, Booz, Obed, Iese,</HI>
and <HI>Dauid.</HI> Where first, it comes
to be considered, how is menti|on
made that <HI>Iacob</HI> begat <HI>Iuda</HI>
and his brethren, more then that
<HI>Abraham</HI> begat <HI>Isaac</HI> and his bre|thren,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That all <HI>Iacobs</HI> sonnes are within the couenant, not so all <HI>Abrahams</HI> what doth it teach vs?</NOTE>
or that <HI>Isaac</HI> begat <HI>Iacob</HI>
and his brother: the reason is,
that all the sonnes of <HI>Abraham</HI>
did not belong to the couenant,
howsoeuer circumcised; neither
did the Lord choose their posteri|ties
to be his Church and pecu|liar
people, as hee did choose
the sonnes of <HI>Iacob,</HI> and their
children.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 9. 4.</NOTE> for vnto them all per|tained
<HI>the Adoption, and the
<PB N="22" REF="24">
Glory, and the Couenants, and the
giuing of the Law and the seruice
of God, and promises.</HI> What a
dispensation is this, all the sonnes
of <HI>Iacob</HI> are pertakers of the ex|ternall
Adoption, not so the
sonnes of <HI>Abraham?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">What cause of thankes giuing is this that so many families of <HI>Iaphet</HI> pre|termitted, we are brought within the couenant?</NOTE> But so it is,
the calling of the Lord is freely: he
is debtor to none, and therefore
they to whom his calling is come,
should so much the more ac|knowledge
themselues obliged
to his mercy, as this day wee are
bound to doe; considering that
he hath passed by so many of the
sonnes of <HI>Adam,</HI> so many of the
families of <HI>Iaphet,</HI> more famous
and honourable, then wee are,
and hath beene pleased to make
his couenant with vs; but let
vs be wise, euer remembring
that there are many within

<PB N="23" REF="24">
who doe not for all that be|long
to the election of grace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A warning to such as are within the coue|nant.</NOTE>
and therefore giuing thankes to
God for the one, that wee are in
the couenant, and haue receiued
the seales thereof, let vs prease
further to be pertaker of the o|ther,
that is, the grace of the Co|uenant.</P>
<P>Next,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three rea|sons giuen why in this Gene|alogie, <HI>Thamar</HI> and <HI>Rahab</HI> are menti|oned a|mong Christs mothers, not <HI>Sara,</HI> nor <HI>Re|becca.</HI></NOTE> it is to be considered
heere, why in this Genealogie
<HI>Thamar, Rahab, and Bethsabe,</HI> are
mentioned among the mothers
of our Lord, and not <HI>Sara,</HI> nor,
<HI>Rebecca,</HI> women famous for god|linesse;
whereas this <HI>Thamar,</HI> how|soeuer
shee had an earnest desire
of seede, and thereby declared
her faith in the promises of God,
yet shee sought it by an vnlawfull
incestuous copulation with her
owne father in law; and <HI>Rahab</HI>
by Nation was a Cananite, by
<PB N="24" REF="25">
conuersation a harlot, and <HI>Beth|shabe</HI>
the wife of <HI>Vriah</HI> was shee
with whom <HI>Dauid</HI> committed
double adultrie. The reasons of
this are many, but wee content
vs with three: the first is to hum|ble
the Iewes: the second is to
comfort sinners: the third to
shew the great glory of Christ.</P>
<P>As for the first,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first is to represse the arro|gancie of the Iewes, glorying of their progeni|tors.</NOTE> it is knowne
how insolently the Iewes gloried
that they were the posteritie of
<HI>Abraham,</HI> neglecting the vertues
of their fathers, they boasted that
they were their children, estee|ming
their fathers vertue a suffi|cient
Apologie and defence of
all their vices: and therefore to
humble them, the blemishes of
their parents are purposly shewed
in this Genealogie. And to teach
all men that true Nobilitie is
not in the priuiledges of flesh,
<PB N="25" REF="25">
but in the graces of the minde, nei|ther
to be sought without vs in
the prerogatiues of our parents,
but within our owne proper ver|tues,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An answer for such as vainely glory of their pa|rentage.</NOTE>
whereby we are rectified. But
at this day it may be spoken to ma|ny,
which, as <HI>Nazianzen</HI> records,
was sometime answered to a Noble
man, despising another that was
come of meane parentage, &amp; boa|sting
of his owne nobilitie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nazan&punc; in nobilem ma|le moratum.</NOTE> <HI>mihi, in|quit,
probro genus meum est, tu au|tem
generituo:</HI> My parentage is a
reproach to me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The se|cond is, for the com|fort of poore pe|nitent sin|ners, he a|sumed that nature which once was sinnefull and did se|parate it from sinne.</NOTE> but thou art a re|proach
to they parentage.</P>
<P>The second reason is to com|fort
poore penitent sinners. The
Lord Iesus came into the world
<HI>non vt iudex, sed vt medicus,</HI> not
as a iudge, but as a Phisitian, <HI>non
vt nostra fugeret opprobria, sed ex|tingueret
potius:</HI> that hee might
not shunne our reproches, but
<PB N="26" REF="26">
rather that hee might blot them
out, and heale them. If it had
pleased him hee might haue cre|ated
mans nature anew, such
as had neuer sinned, as was <HI>A|dams</HI>
nature before the fall, such
a one, I say, might hee haue cre|ated,
and ioyned it in a personall
vnion with his diuine, but if so
hee had done, where then should
haue bene the comfort of sinners,
wee had still remained vnder des|peration,
without any hope that
this nature of ours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See wat a comfort is here.</NOTE> should euer
haue beene deliuered from the
corruption thereof, but that now
hee assumed our nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">&rindx;</NOTE> which
once was sinfull, and hath fully
seperated it from all sinne, it giues
vnto vs liuely hope, that hee will
also sunder vs from our sinnes,
so that they shall not be able to
hinder our spirituall fellowship,
<PB N="27" REF="26">
and communion with him.</P>
<P>The third reason is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The third is to mani|fest Christ his glory, in that hee tooke no holinesse from his parents.</NOTE> to mani|fest
Christ his greater glory, by
declaring to the world, that hee
tooke no holinesse of his fathers.
If all his parents mentioned in
this Genealogie had bene famous
for godlinesse onely, it might
haue beene thought a small mat|ter
for Christ to be holy, that
was come of so holy progenitors;
but in that he descended of sinne|full
parents, and yet was borne
a holy one, and without sinne, it

so <HI>Salomons</HI> brother germaine.
Where if the doubt be moued
how our Sauiour could discend
of them both, they being two
brethren, it is answered that by
the Law established among the
Iewes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 25. 5.</NOTE> it was prouided that if a
man had died without issue, his
brother, or neerest kinsman, was
bound to marrie his wife, and

not by generation. And
therefore <HI>Ieconiah,</HI> as I haue said,
dying without issue, <HI>Salathiel</HI> the
sonne of <HI>Neri,</HI> in the line of the
other brother <HI>Nathan,</HI> comes in,
as neerest Heyre, and is reckon|ed

when one not naturally dis|cended
<PB N="34" REF="30">
of another, yet succeded
as neerest of kinne to the inheri|tance,

of Christ from <HI>Dauid,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Saint Luke</HI> diduces the Natu|rall line of Christ, Saint <HI>Ma|thew</HI> the Legall.</NOTE> making it

<P>This is necessary for vs to ob|serue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ Ie|sus is neuer called the sonne of <HI>Salomon,</HI> Naturall.</NOTE>

<P>Many Kings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">There was neuer a King, Preist, nor Prophet, consecra|ted in so so|lemne a manner as Christ Iesus here is.</NOTE> Preists, and Pro|phets,
hath God sent vnto his
Church since the beginning of
the world, but neuer one like Ie|sus,
the great King, high Preist,
and Prophet of the Church, and
therefore it is not without cause,
that <HI>exordium tanti officii tot est
mistriis consecratum.</HI> Neuer one
was sent to doe such a worke as
he, and therefore neuer one had
such a calling, and confirmation
as hee, for now the heauens are
opened, the holy Ghost in a visi|ble
<PB N="51" REF="38">
shape discends vpon him,
and God the father by an audi|ble
voice from heauen, doth au|thorise
him. The principall end of
this Treatise will be to teach vs
how Iesus is become ours, which
is a speciall and necessary point
for vs to learne.</P>
<P>The parts of his Consecrati|on
are two;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two things considered in this con|secration of Christ to the of|fice of a Redeemer.</NOTE> In the first wee see,
how the Lord Iesus by receiuing
the Sacrament of Baptisme, doth
come in our place and roome,
as our kinsman, as the first borne
of his brethren, as the head of <MILESTONE N="1">
his misticall body; in a word,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That Christ wil|lingly maketh himselfe debtor for vs.</NOTE> as
our cautioner, acting, and obli|gating
himselfe to pay our debt,
and to fulfill those points of righ|teousnesse
which we were bound
to fulfill, but could not doe by
our selues, and so, to releiue, and
redeeme his brethren.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="39">
<MILESTONE N="2"> In the second wee see how the
father not onely accepts him as
debtor for vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That the father not onely ac|cepts him, but or|daines him to this worke.</NOTE> but also designes
and ordaines him to this great
worke, by annointing him with his
holy spirit. And thereafter in a
publicke assembly of the people
at <HI>Iorden,</HI> in most solemne man|ner,
by an audible voice from
heauen, proclames him, to be
that great high Preist, by whom
onely attonement must be made
betweene him and vs.</P>
<P>These two ioyned together
make vp vnto vs a most sure
ground of Christian comfort.<NOTE PLACE="marg">What sweet com+fort arises to vs of these two conioyned together.</NOTE> If
first we consider that the Lord Ie|sus,
for the loue hee bare to the
glory of his father, and saluati|on
of his brethren, voluntarily
steppes into our roome, and in
our name becomes obliged to
his father, according to that no|table
<PB N="53" REF="39">
Prophesie. <HI>Psal.</HI> 40. 6. 7.
which yet were a small thing were
it not that the second followes, to
wit, that the Father of his infi|nit
wisedome finding out in Christ
a way to preserue both the glory
of his mercy, and iustice, doth of
his speciall loue toward vs, not
onely accept him, but ordaine
him to doe the worke of a medi|ator,
imponing to him, that sin|gular
law of a redeemer, which
was neuer imposed to man nor
Angell, as we shall here hereafter.</P>
<P>And here wee learne how by
most sure right the Lord Iesus
becomes ours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How Christ Ie|sus is be|come ours in most sure man|ner.</NOTE> to wit, by the surest
right that can be, namely, the
free gift of God, hee is giuen for
a Prince of saluation to vs, ac|cording
to these testimonies,
both of Angels and men, speak|ing
by inspiration of the holy
<PB N="54" REF="40">
Ghost.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 2. 11.</NOTE> <HI>Vnto you this day is borne
in the Citie of Dauid a Sauiour,
which is Christ the Lord.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 3 16.</NOTE> Againe,
<HI>God so loued the world, that hee
hath giuen his onely begotten sonne,
that whosoeuer beleeues in him
should not perish.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 1. 30.</NOTE> And againe,
<HI>Christ Iesus is made vnto vs, of
God, wisedome, righteousnesse, san|ctification
and redemption.</HI> Looke
then what way any other thing is
ours, which most properly wee
may call ours, that same way
Christ is ours;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Namely by the free gift of God the Father.</NOTE> namely by the free
and sure gift of God. If we know,
and beleeue this, we shall finde it
a most sure ground of comfort to
vphold vs in the houre of tenta|tion.
It is true, <HI>Gloriatio Ecclesiae, est
omnis Christi actio:</HI> Euery action
of Christ is the Churches reioy|cing
and comfort, but what re|ioycing
shall wee haue in any of
<PB N="55" REF="40">
his actions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Except we know this we can haue no comfort in any of Christ his actions.</NOTE> if this ground be not
first laid, that he is ours, and what
he did hee did it for vs, and vn|to
vs? If he had not died for our
sinnes, and risen for our righteous|nesse,
what could his death and re|surrection
haue profited vs? But
here is the ground of all, that he
is giuen vnto vs of the Father for
a Sauiour, whereunto most wil|lingly
hee condescends, and for
which worke the spirit annoints
him, so that now hee is not ano|ther,
nor a stranger to vs, but
our owne, by diuine ordination,&lindx;
and all that hee does, is for vs.
These being premitted, we come
now to the particular historie of
his Baptisme, as it is set downe
by Saint <HI>Luke, Chap. 3. Ver.</HI> 21.</P>
<PB N="56" REF="41">
<BIBL>LVKE 3. 21.</BIBL>
<Q>Now it came to passe, as all the
people were baptised.</Q>
<P>VVHat these people were,<NOTE PLACE="marg">We read not in the Gospell of any Phari|se conuer|ted but one.</NOTE>
you may vnderstand out
of the 7. <HI>Chap. ver.</HI> 29. 30. for there
it is said, that the Pharises and ex|pounders
of the Law, despised the
counsell of GOD, and would not
come to be baptised of S. <HI>Iohn.</HI>
Here then comes poore Publi|canes,
and sinners, and goes be|fore
them into the kingdome of
God. There are many of euery sort
of people (as we may read) saued
in the Gospell, but of Pharises
wee finde none but one, namely,
<HI>Nicodemus:</HI> no sort of men are
further from the kingdome of
God then proud iusticiars.<NOTE PLACE="marg">For a soule filled with a conceit of the owne righ+teousnesse is not ca|pable of grace.</NOTE> For as
a vessell full of one liquor is not
<PB N="57" REF="41">
capable of another: so the soule
which is filled with a vaine con|ceit
of her owne righteousnes, is
not capable of the grace of Christ.
<HI>Huiusmodi animum gratia non in|trat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ber. in Can. Ser. 67.</NOTE>
&amp;c.</HI> Grace entreth not into
such a soule, because it is full, nei|ther
doth grace finde any place to
dwell therein And againe, <HI>Non est
quo intret gratia vbi, &amp;c.</HI> There
is no place for grace to enter in,
where merit hath possession:
what thou attributest to merits
is wanting to grace. I will none of
that merit which excludes grace.</P>
<P>But that the Lord Iesus comes
in among these poore people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That Christ comes to be baptised among sin|ners, shews his great loue and rare humi|litie.</NOTE> it
shewes his wonderfull loue, and
rare humilitie: his loue, for to the
end that hee might help vs, hee
would be like vs, he assumed our
nature, and in it abhorred not
the company of poore sinners.
<PB N="58" REF="42">
<HI>Tu cum homo esses, deus esse vo|luisti,

Wee see by experience, that if a
man fall another cannot raise
him, vnlesse hee bow himselfe
downe vnto him, hee that will
stand in his statelinesse can neuer
raise vp him who hath fallen be|fore
him, the Lord Iesus that hee
might raise vs, was content to

which <HI>Adam</HI> brought on him|selfe,
and his posteritie: for <HI>Adam</HI>
being in honour aspired foolish|ly
to be like vnto God, but he not
onely came short of that where|unto
hee reached, but lost that
good also, which he had before.
Then he was clad with the glori|ous
Image of God, now hath hee

beasts, and being so busked, the
folly of his presumption is check|ed

by his humble obedi|ence:
being equall with God, hee
is found in shape as a seruant.
Now man may reioyce and say,
<HI>Ecce deus quasi vnus ex nobis,</HI> be|hold
<PB N="60" REF="43">
God is as one of vs. Now
Iesus is among sinners, <HI>Gnimma|nuel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn 1.</NOTE>

<P>Againe it is said by Saint <HI>Ma|thew,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">How hee that bap|tises with the spirit, seekes the Baptisme of water from his owne ser|uant.</NOTE>
that Iesus came to <HI>Iohn,</HI> to
be baptised of him; hee might
haue sent for <HI>Iohn,</HI> but he comes
vnto him: hee who hath the Bap|tisme
of the holy Ghost to giue
vnto all his brethren, doth now
come, and seeke the Baptisme
<PB N="61" REF="43">
of water from one of his owne
seruants. Why is this done? surely
to recommend vnto men the re|uerence
of that ministrie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This hee did to re|commend a reuerence of that mi|nistrie or|deined by him in his Church.</NOTE> which
GOD hath appointed in his
Church: no conceit of thy great|nesse
should make thee disdaine
it, since the sonne of God by his
example before thee, hath ho|noured
it. Hee would not teach
and baptise the <HI>Eunuch</HI> by his spi|rit,
hee sent <HI>Philip</HI> to doe it: hee
would not teach, and baptise
<HI>Cornelius</HI> by an Angell, hee sent
<HI>Peter</HI> to doe it: hee would not
baptise <HI>Paul</HI> by himselfe, suppose
hee conuerted him by himselfe,
he sent <HI>Ananias</HI> to doe it. It is an
order stablished in his Church,
<HI>by the foolishnesse of preaching to
saue them who beleeue:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 1. 21.</NOTE> now none
can beleeue vnlesse they heare,
they cannot heare but by preach|ing,
<PB N="62" REF="44">
and none can preach, ex|cept
they be sent: let it therefore
content men to goe to the base

things far inferiour to them|selues,
and seeke saluation by such

hath thought good to giue it,
or else be sure they shall neuer
come neere it.</P>
<P>But now let vs come and see
why Iesus is baptised,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For three reasons was Christ our Lord baptised, when as he needed no washing, being the Lambe vn|spotted.</NOTE> seeing hee
had neither sinne to be forgiuen,
nor nature to be renewed. The
reasons are many, but wee will e|specially
speake of three, the first
is giuen by himselfe: for when
<HI>Iohn</HI> refused to baptise him, a|ledging
hee had more neede to
be baptised of him, hee receiued
this answere, <HI>let alone now, for it
becomes vs to fulfill all righteous|nesse.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="44">As for the righteousnesse of the <MILESTONE N="1">
Law morall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">First that he might fulfill a point of righteous|nesse ne|uer requi|red of any but of him.</NOTE> hee had fulfilled it
perfectly from his youth: for hee
was the innocent Lambe of God,
without spot or blemish, neuer
guile was found in his mouth:
But now he will say, there is more
required of me then the perfor|mance
of that common Law, gi|uen
vnto all men, there is the
singular law of a redeemer, which
yet I haue to fulfill: a law neuer
imposed to Angell nor man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The miste|rie of our redempti|on expla|ned for our greater comfort.</NOTE> but
onely to the sonne of God, Christ
Iesus; by which he was bound so
to loue his father, that hee be|houed
to vindicate the glory
both of his iustice and mercy,
and so to loue his brethren, that
he behoued to take the debt of
their sinnes vpon him, and satis|fie
his fathers iustice for them:
this is it will our Sauiour say, that
<PB N="64" REF="45">
high point of righteousnes, which
yet I haue to fulfill, and for which
I must be baptised, that by recei|uing
of Baptisme, I may become
obliged to doe that for my bre|thren,
which they could not doe
for themselues: for as he that re|ceiued
circumcision, by that same
very deede,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 5. 3.</NOTE> became bound to ful|fill
the whole law: so hee who re|ceiues
Baptisme, becomes obli|ged
to euery condition of that
couenant, whereof Baptisme is a
seale.</P>
<P>That wee may the better vn|derstand
this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two parts of the co|uenant of grace, both of them sealed by Baptisme.</NOTE> wee are to know,
that the couenant of grace, where|of
BAPTISME is a seale, hath
two parts in it, to wit, GODS
part, and mans: GODS part of
the couenant containes promises
made to vs of the remission of
our sinnes, and renouation of our
<PB N="65" REF="45">
nature, comprised in this one
word, <HI>I will be your God.</HI> Our part
againe containes promises made
to God by vs, of faith and obedi|ence,
comprised in this one word,
<HI>we shalbe his people.</HI> Now as Bap|tisme
is a seale of God his part,<NOTE PLACE="marg">As Bap|tisme is a seale on Gods part, pro|mising vs remission, Christ did not re|ceiue it.</NOTE>
confirming the promise of the re|mission
of our sinnes, and reno|uation
of our nature, vnder which
two all other good things are
comprehended, that way Christ
our Sauiour did not receiue it for
himselfe, seeing as I haue said,
hee had neither sinne to be for|giuen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But as it is a seale of our part, promising to God o|bedience, that way he recei|ued it, that he might be bound in our name.</NOTE>
nor nature to be renewed:
but as it is a sacrament of the re|signation
of our selues to God,
and a band, whereby we become
obliged to be his, by acceptati|on
of his badge, and marke vp|on
vs, that way Christ receiued
it, that by accepting the seale of
<PB N="66" REF="46">
the promise, hee might become
obliged in our name, as our head,
to fulfill that which wee promi|sed,
but first behoued to be perfor|med
for vs by himselfe, and at
last shall in vs all, by his grace, al|so
be perfected. And so we see that
<HI>sicut nobis natus est, ita etiam no|bis
baptisatus est,</HI> as hee was not
borne for himselfe, but for vs, so
was hee not baptised for himselfe,
but for vs.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2"> Secondly he was baptised that
he might sanctifie Baptisme to vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ Ie|sus was baptised, to sancti|fie Bap|tisme.</NOTE>
and giue it authority to become
a seale of grace vnto vs, <HI>vt nobis
secundae natiuitatis consecraret la|uacrum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Beda.</NOTE>
and a lauer of regenera|tion,
as the Apostle calles it. He
was washed saith <HI>Ambrose</HI> in the
water of <HI>Iorden,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambros. in Lu. Cap. 3.</NOTE> non mundari vo|lens,
sed mundare,</HI> not to be made
cleane by water, but to make the
<PB N="67" REF="46">
water (wheresoeuer vsed to this
purpose) cleane, for so holy and
heauenly a worke, that Baptisme
being consecrated by him, might
be an holy meane to consecrat vs.</P>
<P>It is true indeede that <HI>Con|stantine</HI>
the great deferred his
Baptisme, till hee might be bap|tised
in <HI>Iorden,</HI> where our Lord
was baptised, though by reason
of sicknesse hee was forced to re|ceiue
Baptisme else-where: but e|uen
as the Lord Iesus by conse|crating
bread and wine which
grew in <HI>Canaan,</HI> did thereby san|ctifie
all bread, and wine, in any
part of the world, to be a Sacra|ment
of his bodie, and blood, it
being vsed according to his insti|tution,
so by washing in the water
of <HI>Iorden</HI> he hath sanctified water
in any part of the world, to be a
Sacrament of regeneration, and
<PB N="68" REF="47">
remission of our sinnes, if so be
it be vsed according to his insti|tution.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3"> And thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ was baptised to seale vp his fellowship with vs.</NOTE> he was baptised,
to seale his fellowship and com|munion
with vs: that cognisance
and badge&punc; whereby he will haue

vnder this same badge, the Prince
of our saluation did encounter
with Sathan and ouercome him,
as after shall be shewed</P>
<P><HI>And prayed:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Our Saui|our recei|ued his baptisme with Prayer.</NOTE>] The Euangelist
<PB N="69" REF="47">
saith, that when our Sauiour was
baptised, he praied, but what hee
prayed, he expresses not. Neuer|thelesse,
we may gather it out of
other places of holy Scripture:
wherein we shall finde, that he
praied for himself, for his church,
and for his enemies. Where if
it be demanded, what needed our
Sauiour to pray for himselfe, see|ing
hee is very God; the answere
is ready, that he is also very Man:
and as man had his owne feares,
dolours, and griefes, proceeding
from the sense of the heauy bur|den
of sinne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How is it that our Sauiour did pray for him|selfe?</NOTE> not his owne sinne, I
say, for hee knew no sinne, but of
our sinne, which was laid vpon
him. As also from the sense of that
fearefull wrath due to sinne; for
strength, and comfort against
these he prayed to his Father, as
witnesseth the Apostle, <HI>that in the
<PB N="70" REF="48">
daies of his flesh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 5. 7.</NOTE> he offered vp pray|ers,
and supplications, crying, and
teares, to his Father, and was heard
also in that which hee feared.</HI>
Which, as we see in the Gospel he
did before his Passion, so now be|fore
his entrie to the worke of our
redemption; a worke greater then
the worke of our first Creation;
for now he hath to satisfie the iu|stice
of his Father; to worke the
confusion of Sathan; and to effe|ctuate
the saluation of his bre|thren.
And therefore in the en|trie
of this great worke he prayes,
no doubt, for an happy successe
thereof, and as it is euident by the
answere he receiues from heauen,
hee was heard in that which hee
prayed for.</P>
<P>And in this also our Sauiour
learnes vs by his example to san|ctifie
all our actions with prayer.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our Lord by his ex|ample tea|cheth vs to sanctifie all our actions by Prayer.</NOTE>
<PB N="71" REF="48">
When he was baptised, he praied:
when he was tempted he prayed:
when he brake bread, he prayed:
when he wrought miracles, he
prayed: when he was troubled in
the garden, he praied: when he suf|fred
on the Crosse, he prayed. As
<HI>Isaacs</HI> mariage could not but pros|per,
because it was begunne with
the prayer of <HI>Abraham</HI> his Father,
prosecuted with the praier of <HI>Elie|zar</HI>
his Seruant, and finished with
his owne prayer: so can it not
faile, but a blessing must be vpon
those honest actions which are
begunne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Actions, suppose they be good with|out pray|er, are like bodies without spirits.</NOTE> continued, and accom|plished
with prayer: where other|wise,
euen those actions which in
themselues are good to the doer,
can not be good, where they are
done without prayer. <HI>Vere nouit
recte viuere, qui recte nouit or are:</HI>
Hee knoweth truely how to liue
<PB N="72" REF="49">
wel, who knoweth how to pray wel.
But best actions without prayer,
which obtaines grace to them,
are like bodies without spirits:
yea, as the body without breath|ing
cannot liue to doe any worke
competent to a Naturall life: so
the soule without prayer, can doe
no worke, that truely is Spirituall.
Therefore said <HI>Macarius,</HI> that con|tinuance
in prayer was, <GAP DESC="foreign">,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Macar. hom. 40.</NOTE> the head of
euery good purpose, &amp; the crown
of euery right, and honest action.</P>
<P>But here we are to be warned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Continu|ance requi|red in Prayer.</NOTE>
that wee content not our selues,
with the shadow of prayer, in steed
of the substance thereof; where
we are to take heede of these two
things: First, that our prayer be
not by starts, without making of
conscience whether it be or not,
<PB N="73" REF="49">
but we must continue &amp; perseuere
in prayer, remembring, he that
sowes sparingly, shal reape sparing|ly:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feruencie and atten|tion in Prayer.</NOTE>
Secondly, that our praier be not
outward, but inward, made with
feruencie of spirit, and attention
of the minde, remembring hee is
the God of the spirits of all flesh,
with whom thou hast to speake in
praier. It is a godly Meditation of
<HI>Chrisostomes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chris. in Math. hom. 25.</NOTE> that as a man who
seekes a thing which hee hath lost
in his house, seekes it with such
affection, that he forgets all other
things; yea, hee seeth not those
things that are afore him, so faine
is he to see that which hee is see|king,
euen such should be the dis|position
of a Christian, so earnest|ly
desiring mercy, and grace from
God, that till hee finde it, no other
thing be in his minde to distract
him from seeking it.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="50">And vnto this continuance
and feruencie in prayer, it should
greatly encourage vs, that now we
see after our Sauiours prayer the
heauens are opened, shewing vs
the great vertue of prayer: if wee
pray in his name, if we send it vp
like incense, perfumed with his
merit, flowing from faith in him,
it opens heauen vnto vs, &amp; brings
vs backe a fauourable answere.

the first degree of their ascensi|on
with Christ, for as by new|nesse
of life they rise with Christ,
partakers of the first resurrecti|on:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reu. 20. 6</NOTE>
so by prayer they ascend with
Christ, partakers of the first as|cension;
which is vnto them an
vndoubted pledge of the ascensi|on
both of their soules and bo|dies

are in the bodie, they get accesse

<P><PB N="78" REF="52">But here wee haue to consider,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three waies doth the father beare wit|nesse to his Sonne.</NOTE>

God the father witnesseth

downe of the holy Ghost, in a visi|ble

an audible voice from heauen,
proclaiming him to be that belo|ued
Sonne of God, in whom the

<P>The first then is the opening of
the heauens,<NOTE PLACE="marg">First, by the ope|ning of the hea|uens.</NOTE> by which visible

<HEAD>And the holy Ghost came down in a

<P>THe second way wherby the Fa|ther

is as you see, by sending down the
holy Ghost vpon him, in the simi|litude
<PB N="80" REF="53">
of a Doue; vvhereby his
vnction, which in it selfe is spiri|tuall,
and could not be perceiued,
was represented &amp; notified vnto al
the people: for he was not annoin|ted
vvith any materiall oyle, but
with the oyle of gladnes, accor|ding
to that Prophesie: <HI>The spirit

<P>Where for remouing of all
doubts that may here arise, we must
vnderstand that Christs vnction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two things con|sidered in the vncti|on of Christ.</NOTE>
hath in it these two things: the
<MILESTONE N="1"> first is, a separating and designing
of him to the worke of a Mediator;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The sepa|rating or designing of him to the worke of a Re|deemer.</NOTE>
&amp; this part extends to the whole
person of Christ Iesus, God, and
Man. Now in this action of desig|nation,
albeit, the three persons
of the blessed Trinitie concurre,
<PB N="81" REF="53">
and so Iesus be both the designer,
and the person designed: yet be|cause
the father is first in order,
this action is ascribed to him, <HI>for
him hath the father sealed.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 6. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>The other part of this vnction,<MILESTONE N="2">
is the communicating of the gra|ces
of the Spirit vnto him:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The com|municati|on of grace sufficient for that worke vn|to him.</NOTE> and
this is extended onely to his hu|mane
nature, so that albeit it be
true, that our Sauiour was annoin|ted
in both his Natures, because
he is our Mediator not in any one
of them, but in both: yet we must
remember the difference, that his
annointing in respect of the di|uine
Nature imports onely the
separating,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christs vnction, in regard of his diuine Nature.</NOTE> and designing of the
second Person of the Trinitie, to
worke the vvorke of mans Re|demption.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Athanas. de Incar. verbi.</NOTE>

created vs, when wee were

image of the Father, that is to

<P>But his annointing in respect
of his humane Nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christs vnction in regard of his hu|mane Na|ture.</NOTE> imports
also the communication of the
graces of the holy Spirit vnto
him, not in measure, as his bre|thren
receiues them, but aboue
all measure: for in number he had
all graces of the spirit, he wanted
none; and next he had euery one
of them in the full degree: in
which respects the Spirit was ne|uer
communicated vnto any, but
to Iesus Christ alonely.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="54">Thus we vnderstand how Iesus

that he was conceiued of the

declaration, and publike manife|station
to the world, by a visible
signe of the fulnesse of grace com|municated
to him, for the doing
of this great worke, whereunto he
is now ordained: and this is done
partly for the confirmation of
<HI>Iohn,</HI> who albeit hee knew that
Christ was come, yet he knew not
who hee was, till by this token gi|uen

not,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn 1. 33.</NOTE> but he that sent mee to baptise

downe, and tarry still on him, that
is he, which baptiseth with the holy

the Sonne of God.</P>
<P>And that the holy Ghost di|scends
vpon him at this time in
the similitude of a Doue, and not

when he comes to proclaime the

tidings of mans saluation) hee
comes not in a terrible manner:
Neither to accuse nor conuict of
sinne, nor to trouble and torment
the conscience for sinne, for that
is the operation of the Law; but as
the Lambe of God that takes away
the sinnes of the world,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn 1. 29</NOTE> hee cryes
peace to the conscience within, of

<HEAD>And there was a voice from hea|uen,

<P><MILESTONE N="3"> THe third way, by vvhich the

Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">By an au|dible voice from hea|uen.</NOTE> is by an audible voice from
heauen: where wee haue to consi|der
not onely the testimonie it
selfe, but the circumstances that
goe before it: as, namely vvho
giues the testimonie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three things considered in this te|stimonie.</NOTE> God the
Father: in vvhat manner it is gi|uen,
by an audible voice: and from
what place, from heauen.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1"> As for the first, the author of
this testimonie may be collected
out of the words,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The au|thor of it, to wit, God the Father.</NOTE> to be God the
Father: the Sonne comes to make
the Father known vnto the world,
<PB N="89" REF="57">
for no man knowes the Father but
the Sonne.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 1. 18.</NOTE> <HI>No man hath seene God
at any time, the onely begotten
Sonne, who is in the bosome of the
Father, he hath declared him:</HI> and
the Father againe makes the Son
knowne vnto the world, by the
holy Ghost: for euen <HI>Iohn</HI> Bap|tist,
though the greatest Prophet
among the children of women,
knew not this Sonne of God, till
the Father, as we said, pointed him
out vnto him.</P>
<P>Here then for our further com|fort
wee haue to consider,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the three per|sons of the blessed Trinitie, concurre to the worke of our Re|demption.</NOTE> how
the three persons of the blessed
Trinitie concurre together, to
worke the great worke of our re|demption:
for here is the father
designing, ordaining, proclai|ming:
here is the Sonne accept|ing,
and the holy Ghost annoin|ting:
these three wrought con|iunctly
<PB N="90" REF="58">
the worke of our first cre|ation:
in the beginning of Gene|sis,
mention, suppose obscure, is
made of them, by a name Plurall,
<HI>Elohim,</HI> expressing the Trinitie of
persons, and a verbe singular, <HI>Ba|ra,</HI>
expressing the vnitie of their
Nature, and coniunct operation.
But here a more cleare and di|stinct
mention is made of the
three persons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This com|forts vs against the feare of Sathans power, and our weake|nes.</NOTE> yet all working one
worke, and that for our comfort,
that we considering who it is, hath
taken in hand to worke the worke
of our saluation, should neither
be discouraged, for the power
and malice of our spiritual aduer|sarie,
that withstands it; neither
yet for our owne manifold wants,
and infirmities, for that grace
which Iesus hath receiued, is not
for himselfe, but for vs; <HI>that,</HI> as
saith the Euangelist, <HI>of his fulnesse
<PB N="91" REF="58">
we might all receiue grace for grace:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn 1. 16.</NOTE>
which was figured in that <HI>oint|ment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 133. 2</NOTE>
poured on the head of Aaron,
it rested not there, but went downe
to the borders of his garments:</HI> euen
so the grace communicated to
Christ, flowes from him to the
smallest member of his mysticall
body, in such measure, as shall be
sufficient, to prepare and perfect
them vnto eternall life.</P>
<P>The next circumstance con|taines <MILESTONE N="2">
the manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The man|ner, to wit, by an au|dible voice from hea|uen.</NOTE> by which this
testimonie is giuen, to wit, by an
audible voice, such as all the peo|ple
there present might heare, &amp;
vnderstand. How this voice was
sounded, is needlesse for vs to en|quire,
the Lord who made the
tongue, can speake without the
tongue, and frame Organes of
voice at his pleasure, by which he
can proclaime his will, euen to
<PB N="92" REF="59">
the eares of men, who without a voice
cannot heare him. Thus the Lord
both by his practise and precept
hath declared,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gos|pell should be preach|ed in such a language as people may vnder|stand it.</NOTE> that hee will haue
his Gospell, which is a doctrine
of Christ, preached to the whole
world, clearely, distinctly, and in
such a manner, as all may heare
it: the practise wee haue here, the
precept we haue hereafter: for our
Sauiour commanded his Disci|ples,
that what hee told them in
the eare, they should proclaime
it on the tops of houses; &amp; for this
cause,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Therefore Christ en|dued the Apostles with the gift of lan|guages.</NOTE> did the holy Ghost endue
them with the gifts of tongs, that
vnto euery people they might
speake in their owne language,
otherwise one language had been
sufficient for all people. Whereof
it is euident, that they who deli|uer
this doctrine, either by whis|pering,
or muttering in the eare,
<PB N="93" REF="59">
or else in such a language as peo|ple
doe not vnderstand, declare
themselues not to be the Ambas|sadours
of the God of heauen,
neither following his practise, nor
obaying his precept; but Locusts,
proceeding from the smoake that
comes out of the bottomlesse pit,
by which Antechrist, that <HI>fallen
Star,</HI> endeauours to obscure both
the Sunne, and the Ayre, know|ing
that the vantage of his king|dome
stands in darknesse.</P>
<P>The third circumstance is of <MILESTONE N="3">
the place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The place from which the testi|monie is giuen.</NOTE> from which this testi|monie
is giuen, to wit, from hea|uen:
whereof first wee learne that
the doctrine of the Gospell is hea|uenly
doctrine, not written by na|ture
in the heart of man, as is the
law, but heauenly and supernatu|rall,
bred in the bosome of God;
proceeding from the deep of God
<PB N="94" REF="60">
his infinite wisedome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This lets vs see first, that the Gospel is a heauenly doctrine.</NOTE> which no
creature, neither Angell, nor man,
by the light of Nature could euer
haue imagined, if the Lord from
heauen had not reuealed it; and
therefore euen the Angels not|withstanding
they be <HI>secundaria
lumina,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nazian.</NOTE> next vnto God, <HI>Spirits of
greatest light, and vnderstanding,</HI>
are said to admire this mysterie
of the Gospell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Pet. 1. 12</NOTE> desirous to behold
those things, which are taught in
the Church concerning it.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Secondly, the maie|stie and dignitie of the Gos|pell.</NOTE> the maiestie &amp; dig|nitie
of the Gospell, is here re|commended
vnto vs; the Law
was giuen on earth, proclaimed
from the top of Mount</HI> Sinai: <HI>yet,</HI>
euery transgression, and disobedi|ence
thereof receiued a iust recom|pence
of reward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 2. 2.</NOTE> how then shall wee
escape, if we neglect so great a salua|tion,
which at the first began to be

preached by the Lord, and after|ward
was confirmed to vs by them
that heard him?</P>
<P><HI>And againe we are warned,</HI> See
yee despise him not that speakes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 12. 25</NOTE> for
if they escaped not, who refused him
that spake on earth, much more shal
not wee escape, if wee turne away
from him, that speakes from hea|uen.</P>
<P>And thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thirdly, no way to bring a man to heauen, but by the faith of the Gospell.</NOTE> the proclaiming
of this doctrine from heauen, as
likewise the opening of the hea|uens,
at the first proclamation of
it, is to teach vs that there is no
way, whereby man may learne a
ready way to heauen, but by this
doctrine of the Gospell, which is
come from heauen. Pitifull then
is the blindnes of worldlings, to
whom heauen is opened, and of|fered
by the Gospell: but they
will not so much as looke vpon it,

but that wee close the
mouth of Sathan, and of our owne
infidelitie, receiuing this for an
vndoubted truth, which the Lord
in this heauenly Oracle deliuereth
vnto vs: that this Christ Iesus,
the Sonne of <HI>Mary,</HI> is the Sonne
of God, and that promised <HI>Mes|sias,</HI>
on whom all the Fathers
since, the first beginning, fastened
their hope, and of whom all the
<PB N="108" REF="67">
Prophets hath spoken, pointing
him out, as it were with the fin|ger,
how hee was to come to
worke the worke of our saluati|on,
which in all circumstances
wee see performed by him, as
was prophesied by them, to our
euerlasting comfort.</P>
<P>Wee might hereunto adde
some testimonies of the Gentiles,
as of <HI>Mercurius Trismegistus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lactan. Iustit. lib. 1. cap. 6.</NOTE> lit|tle
posterior in time to <HI>Moses:</HI>
whose testimonie <HI>Lactantius</HI> cals
<HI>Diuino simile,</HI> Diuine-like, as like|wise
out of the Oracles of <HI>Sibillae,</HI>
which were tenne in number; so
called, because they declared the
counsels of God, <HI>quasi</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">,
and were by some of the Fathers
accounted prophetesses of the
Gentiles: for seeing the Lord <HI>Ie|sus</HI>
was to be sent into the world
for saluation both of Iewes and
<PB N="109" REF="67">
Gentiles, it pleased the Lord long
before his comming, to make
signification thereof, not to the
Iewes onely, by Prophets raised
vp among themselues, but to the
Gentiles also, who because they
could not easily embrace the te|stimonie
of the Iewes, in a mat|ter
of religion, it pleased him, by
their own Prophets, to make pre|dictions,
and descriptions of Iesus
Christ, that when they should
come to passe, they might haue
no exception against them. And
therefore is it that the heathen
persecuting Emperours, stirred
vp with hatred by Sathan, against
the very name of Christians, the
mysterie whereof they no man|ner
of way vnderstood, nor yet
would receiue any light, that
might bring them to the know|ledge
therof, forbade the reading
<PB N="110" REF="68">
of their owne Sibilline Oracles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iustin. Mart. Orat. ad Anton. Pium.</NOTE>
and that because euen their owne
prophesies, bare witnes to the ve|ritie
of Christian religion. But
for the present, we content vs with
that most sure word of the Pro|phets,
as S. <HI>Peter</HI> calles it, and
rests in this heauenly Oracle,
which the Father from heauen
proclaimed, concerning his Son:
<HI>Blessing the Lord our God, who
hath opened vnto vs the mysterie
of his will, according to his good
pleasure, which hee had purposed in
Christ. By whom wee haue redemp|tion
through his bloud, the forgiue|nes
of sinnes, according to his
rich grace. To him be praise
and glory, for euer.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A
TREATISE OF
Christ his Temptation.</HEAD>
<P>_WE are now come to the
historie of Christ his
tentation, which being
ioined with the former
two, whereof wee haue spoken,
makes vp vnto vs a complete do|ctrine
of Christian comfort: for
in his Genealogie, we haue seene
what manner a man Christ Iesus
is. In his Baptisme wee haue lear|ned,
how he is become ours, and
now in his temptation we see, how
hee beginnes to worke the worke
<PB N="114" REF="70">
of Sathans confusion, and our Re|demption.</P>
<P>Great ioy was there in the
campe of Israel, when they saw
that <HI>Dauid</HI> ouercame Goliah,
cast him to the ground, and cut
off his head, for he was a dread|full
enemie, hee had reuiled the
host of the liuing God, and none
of <HI>Saul</HI> his warriours durst en|counter
with him. But greater ioy
should be in our hearts, when we
see how our <HI>Dauid</HI> in this singu|lar
combate, fights with spiritu|all
<HI>Goliah</HI> hand to hand, and
ouercomes him; who euer since
the creation hath beene a shame|lesse
blasphemer of the euerliuing
God, and an spitefull enemie of
all true Israelites. In this first com|bat
the Sonne of God casts him
downe: In the last combat which
he fights with him, on the crosse,
<PB N="115" REF="70">
he bursts his head. Sathan temp|ting
the first <HI>Adam</HI> in Paradise,
ouercame him, and so caried him
away and his posteritie, in a feare|full
captiuitie, and bondage: but
the second <HI>Adam</HI> suffering temp|tation
by Sathan in the wilder|nes,
ouercomes him, and by
a more glorious victory then
<HI>Abraham</HI> had ouer <HI>Chedarlao|mer,</HI>
doth hee recouer his owne
<HI>Lots,</HI> from the power of this
enemie.</P>
<P>In all we haue three points here
to be treated of:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three things to be consi|dered in it.</NOTE> first, the circum|stances
premitted: Secondly the
combat it selfe, consisting of a
three-fold assault, made by Sa|than,
with their seuerall repulses,
giuen by our Lord: Thirdly, the
euent, and issue thereof.</P>
<P>The circumstances premitted <MILESTONE N="1">
are sixe:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Circum|stances going be|foreit, sixe in number.</NOTE> First, the time, which is
<PB N="116" REF="71">
declared to haue beene immedi|ately
after his Baptisme: Second|ly,
the place, expressed to be the
wildernes: Thirdly, the motion,
by which hee is caried thither, to
wit, by the spirit: Fourthly, the
person who is tempted; namely,
Iesus, full of the holy Ghost: Fift|ly,
the tempter, named here the
Diuell: Last of all, the occasion
of the temptation, which is said
to be CHRIST his hunger, after
that hee had fasted fotty dayes.
As for the time it is noted to
haue beene immediately after his
baptisme:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The time of Christ his temp|tation is first noted.</NOTE> hee had liued twenty
nine yeares a priuate man, and
all that time wee reade not that
Sathan tempted him; but now
when hee comes out in publike
to doe the worke of a Redeemer,
for the glorie of God, and good
of his brethren, hee is assaulted
<PB N="117" REF="71">
of Sathan with all his might.</P>
<P>Whereof it is euident,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Persons in high cal|lings sub|iect to greatest temptati|ons, if they be faithfull in them.</NOTE> how Sa|than
intends his greatest malice
against them, who are set vp into
those high callings, in the which
greatest good may be done, to
the glorie of God, and saluation
of others: So was it with <HI>Moses,</HI> so
long as he liued a priuate life, he
liued a peaceable life: but when
hee came forth to be a deliuerer
of his brethren, from their bon|dage
in <HI>Egypt,</HI> then was he perse|cuted
by <HI>Pharao:</HI> So also with <HI>Da|uid,</HI>
in his priuate calling hee had
quietnes; but from the time that
hee had once begunne to worke
the deliuerance of Israel, by the
slaughter of Goliah, and was an|nointed
King by <HI>Samuel,</HI> for the
greater benefit of that people:
then did Sathan stirre vp <HI>Saul</HI> a|gainst
him, who hunted him like a
<PB N="118" REF="72">
Partrich, through the fieldes and
mountaines of Israel. The like al|so
may be seene in the Apostle
S. <HI>Paul,</HI> in <HI>Sosthenes,</HI> and many o|thers.
As trees on the toppes of
hilles are obiect to euery winde;
so persons in a high calling, if in
a good conscience they labour to
discharge it, shall finde themselues
on euery side compassed with
temptations.</P>
<P>Neither is it so onely with those
that are set vp in more eminent
callings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Such as giues their names to Christ, let them looke to be temp|ted of Sa|than.</NOTE> but with euery Christi|an
also: what malice Sathan pra|ctised
against the head, that same
will he practise against the mem|bers.
So soone as our Lord was
borne, so soone was he persecuted
by <HI>Herod:</HI> so soone as he was bap|tised,
so soone was he tempted by
Sathan; thus as saith <HI>Chrysostome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In Math. hom. 7.</NOTE>
ab ipfis vitae initiis ad tentationes
<PB N="119" REF="72">
praeparam<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">r:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Macar. hom. 47.</NOTE> then we see that euen
in the cradle our Lord began to
beare the crosse, and no sooner
we are borne by regeneration to
be his, but so soone without fur|ther
delay, doth Sathan set vpon
vs with all his might, like a new
<HI>Pharao,</HI> pursuing Israel, to see if
hee can reduce vs to his former
seruitude, and bondage.</P>
<P>And this I marke for the com|fort
of weake and young Christi|ans,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A comfort for yong Christians who after their con|uersion are exercised with vnac|customed temptati|ons.</NOTE>
who after their conuersion
finde themselues troubled with
great temptations, wherewith be|fore
they were not acquainted, let
them know that it is a cursed
peace, to be at peace with Sa|than,
and giue thankes to God,
who now hath put them in an ini|mitie
with him: for thereby they
may know they are none of his;
but are called to a fellowship and
<PB N="120" REF="73">
communion with Christ, <HI>Diabolus
enim non persequitur nisi bonos,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. de Temp. Iust. 58.</NOTE>
Sathan pursues none but good
men, such as hathcast off his yoke:
as for the wicked what needes
hee to pursue them, seeing hee
possesses them? yea, so farre is he
from tempting them, that he vses
them as his instruments, to tempt
others: and therefore let vs not
be discouraged, but rather con|firmed,
when wee finde our selues
tempted by Sathan.</P>
<P>The second circumstance is of
the place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The place of the com|bat is next set downe.</NOTE> noted here to be the
wildernes: Wherin two things we
obserue, one in the person of the
Aduersarie; letting vs see how he
is a restlesse tempter, sparing no
place, not Paradise, nor the wil|dernes,
in the Temple, <HI>Vbique in|sidiatur
homini,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. de Temp. 77.</NOTE> euery where hee
lyes in waite for vs: neither can
<PB N="121" REF="73">
wee goe our way. Wherein hee
hath not his snares laid before
vs:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambros.</NOTE> <HI>multi laquei quacunque progre|dimur,</HI>
there be many snares
wheresoeuer we goe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In euery piece Sa|than hath his snare spred out for temp|tation.</NOTE> our way on
earth, being like the way of Isra|el,
wherein lurkes many fiery Ser|pents
to sting vs, that hurts vs
many time before wee can per|ceiue
them: none of all the chil|dren
of God, but they haue mar|ked
this in their own experience,
for where is the place, wherein we
haue not beene tempted; yea,
wounded by this subtle serpent,
and almost slaine to the death; if
mercy and grace had not come
in from God to succour vs? The
remedie is that we suspect this ad|uersarie
in euery place wherein
we come, walking as the Apostle
commands vs circumspectly, and
with feare and trembling: euer
<PB N="122" REF="74">
looking vp for grace, to keepe vs
wee fall not into his snare, at least
we perish not in it.</P>
<P>The other thing to be obser|ued
here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In this combat our Lord giues the Aduersarie vantage of the place, and why?</NOTE> is the person of our
Lord, who ouerthrowes Sathan
in so victorious a manner, that
no exception can be made a|gainst
it; for in that Nature
which Sathan once had ouercome
doth he encounter with him, and
giues him also the vantage of
place. Sathan tempted the first
<HI>Adam</HI> in Paradise, which was the
place in all the world, wherein he
should haue been strongest to re|sist
the Diuell, considering that
in it he had very many tokens of
Gods great goodnes toward him,
euer before his eyes; yet in
it Sathan ouercame him: But
the second <HI>Adam</HI> to recouer this
losse, encounters with Sathan in
<PB N="123" REF="74">
the wildernes, a place of all
other in the world, meetest for
Sathan to tempt a man in; spe|cially
to desperation. Thus we see,
<HI>quemadmodum suis nodis praeiudi|<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ia
resoluantur,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambros in Luke 4. Nazian. Orat. 21. Apologel.</NOTE> &amp; suis diuina be|neficia
vestigiis reformentur:</HI> for
the first <HI>Adam</HI> tempted by Sa|than,
was driuen from Paradise
to the wildernes, but the second
<HI>Adam</HI> by suffering himselfe to be
tempted of Sathan, brings home
the first againe from the wilder|nes
into Paradise: thus doth hee
follow the Aduersarie, as it were,
foote by foote, confounding him
in all those meanes, by which
before ouer man hee made his
conquest.</P>
<P>The third circumstance is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The third circum|stance, he is led into the wilder|ness by motion of the spirit.</NOTE> that
our Lord was ledde into the wil|dernes
by the motion of the spi|rit,
to wit, that same spirit which
<PB N="124" REF="75">
before descended on him at Ior|den;
and wherewith here hee is
said to haue beene filled, and re|plenished.
Of this we learne that
temptations comes not by acci|dent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Temptati|ons are or|dered by uine dis|pensation.</NOTE>
or chance, but are ordered
by diuine dispensation: In our
weakenes ofttimes wee conceit of
our temptations, as if they came
to vs by the will of Sathan: but
in very truth it is not so, he is in|deede
a roaring Lyon, but the
Lord haue bound him in chaines,
and without the bounds of his
chaine hee cannot goe, roare as
hee will, hee is not able to ap|proach
vnto vs, nor moue any
temptation against vs, but as he
is a licenced of the Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ber. in Psal. qui habit at Ser. 13..</NOTE> <HI>est
quidem leo rugiens, sed gratias ago
magno illi leoni de tribu Iuda, ru|gire
iste potest, ferire non potest:</HI>
hee is indeede a roaring Lyon,
<PB N="125" REF="75">
but I giue thankes vnto the great
Lyon of the Tribe of <HI>Iudah,</HI> hee
may roare, but he cannot strike
me.</P>
<P>It is therefore good to remem|ber
in our temptations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three no|table com|forts in tempta|tion.</NOTE> these
three things: First, that it is the
Lord who takes vs by the hand,
and enters vs within the listes to
fight in his name, hand to hand
with Sathan, as here our Lord is
ledde by the spirit to be temp|ted:
Secondly, that the Lord
measures our temptations, and
will not suffer vs to be tempted
aboue our power: And thirdly,
that wheresoeuer he leade vs, he
goes with vs, not as a spectator
onely to behold vs, which should
also greatly encourage vs, that
wee fight vnder the eye of our
King, but as an actor also fighting
in vs; helping our infirmities,
<PB N="126" REF="76">
and strengthening our weakenes,
by his grace: and therefore how
euer our Aduersarie be like a
mighty terrible <HI>Goliah,</HI> yet should
wee not be afraide to goe forth
against him in the name of the
Lord our God.</P>
<P>In the fourth circumstance we
haue to consider the Person,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fourth circum|stance is of the person tempted.</NOTE> who
is tempted, to wit, Iesus, full of
the holy Ghost. In regard of his
nature, he is very man, and so he
behoued to be, that hee might
ouercome the Aduersarie of man,
<HI>alioqui iuste victus non fuisset:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Theodoret. dial. 2. cap. 26.</NOTE>
otherwise, he had not been whol|ly
conquered, but in regard of
the qualitie of his Nature, per|fectly
holy, and fully sanctified:
so full of the holy Ghost, that not
so much as a contrarie motion of
euill could enter into him, no
more then liquor can be conuaied
<PB N="127" REF="76">
into a vessel, which is full already:
and this is it, which our Sauiour
testifies in another place; <HI>The
prince of this world commeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 14. 30.</NOTE> and
hath nothing in me.</HI></P>
<P>It is true that <HI>Iohn</HI> the Baptist,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Neuer any full of the holy Ghost as Christ Ie|sus was.</NOTE>
and <HI>Stephen</HI> the first Martir, are
also said to haue beene full of
the holy Ghost; but that is spo|ken
either in comparison of them|selues,
who at sometime were
more filled with grace, then at
another: for in all the godly the
Spirit hath his own intention and
remission; or else in comparison
of themselues, with other men.
But as for Christ Iesus, it is his
singular priuiledge, that hee re|ceiued
the spirit aboue, and be|yond
all measure, that of his ful|nesse
all his Saints and seruants
might receiue grace for grace,
euery one a portion in their
<PB N="128" REF="77">
owne measure: whereof it comes
to passe, that there being in most
holy men, a great vacuitie and
emptinesse; roome is made for
Sathan to enter in, and worke
vpon the corruption hee findes
there, but in the Lord Iesus it is
not so.</P>
<P>But here two things further
are to be considered: first, how
could Christ be tempted, there
being, as I haue said, no corrupti|on
in him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sundry sorts of temptati|ons.</NOTE> whereupon any temp|tation
could worke: and second|ly,
for what causes was he temp|ted.
For resolution of the first, we
are to consider the sundry sorts
of temptations, there is one wher|by
man tempts God: this is ex|pressely
forbidden,<NOTE PLACE="marg">God temp|teth man, and is tempted of man.</NOTE> as we will shew
hereafter; one whereby GOD
tempts man, so the Lord temp|ted
<HI>Abraham,</HI> and he is said also to
<PB N="129" REF="77">
haue tempted the Israelites; as,
for that which S. <HI>Iames</HI> saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 13.</NOTE> that
God tempts no man; wee must
know that there is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. in Ioan. tract. 43.</NOTE> <HI>tentatio quae
probat, &amp; tentatio quae decipit:</HI>
a temptation which proueth, and
a temptation which deceiueth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">One man tempts an other: these sinne after the simili|tude of Sa|than.</NOTE>
By the first of these only the Lord
tempts, but neuer by the second.
There is also a temptation, where|by
one man tempts another to
snare him, or manifest some
weakenes in him; so the <HI>Herodi|ans</HI>
and <HI>Pharises</HI> tempted Christ:
and this is common to all the wic|ked
men of the world, that not
content to doe euill themselues,
they delight also to tempt others
to euill. Let such remember that
this is to sinne after the similitude
of Sathan, who not content to
rebell against GOD himselfe,
tempted man also to the same
<PB N="130" REF="78">
rebellion with him: and there|fore
may they looke to be punish|ed,
after the similitude of his con|demnation:
and last of all, there
is a temptation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sathan tempteth man.</NOTE> by which Sathan
tempts man, plaine contrarie to
that which is ascribed to the Lord;
for it is not to make man bet|ter,
nor to manifest any goodnes
that by grace is in him, but euer
to snare him: for which cause the
temptations of God are compa|red
to fanning, that driues away
the chaffe and dust, and so fines
the corne: but Sathans temptati|ons
are compared to sifting, that
letts away the good, but keepes
still the worst.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The temp|tations of Christ were ex|ternall on|ly, and could not enter into him.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now to returne to the questi|on;
we must know that the temp|tations
of Christ, in this doe differ
from the temptations of <HI>Adam,</HI>
and all other men in the world;
<PB N="131" REF="78">
that his were onely externall, that
is, such as Sathan presented by
externall voices and obiects to
his eare and eye; but could ne|uer
carry any further, for incon|tinent
the Lord Iesus discerned
the vanitie of them, by the per|fect
light of his minde, and in|stantly
repelled them, by the vn|changeable
holines of his will; so
that he was not so much as affect|ed
or moued with them; farre
lesse infected, by consenting vnto
them, and in this, as I said, hee
farre excels, the first <HI>Adam,</HI> and
all his posteritie.</P>
<P>For as for our first Parents <HI>A|dam</HI>
and <HI>Euah,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">It was far otherwise with <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Euah.</HI></NOTE> in that first onset
Sathan made vpon them, by pre|senting
externall obiects to their
eyes, and voices to their eares, he
incontinent fastned his sting into
them, by reason that they how|soeuer
<PB N="132" REF="79">
made holy; yet being mu|table,
were easily affected with his
allurements, and so wounded by
him: but the second <HI>Adam,</HI> be|ing
perfect, and vnchangeable in
holines, was in such sort tempted,
that he was not, nor could not
be peruerted, no more then the
most stable rockes of the Sea are
moued, or remoued by the raging
waues thereof.</P>
<P>Whereof great comfort re|dounds
vnto vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The salua|tion con|quest, by the second <HI>Adam,</HI> can|not be lost to any of his mem|bers.</NOTE> who now by
grace are the generation of the
second <HI>Adam,</HI> and beares his
image; as by Nature we were the
sonnes of the first <HI>Adam,</HI> and did
carry also his image. What the
first <HI>Adam</HI> had by creation, hee
receiued it not for himselfe one|ly,
but for his posteritie also: if
he had kept it for himselfe, hee
had kept it to them also; and
<PB N="133" REF="79">
when he lost it to himselfe, he lost
it to his posteritie: And the se|cond
<HI>Adam,</HI> the Lord Iesus, in like
maner, that stock of life in whom,
by grace we are grafted, and of
whom onely, wee as Christians
haue our beginning and being;
what hee hath receiued as Me|diator
from his Father,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Comfort.</NOTE> he recei|ued
it not for himselfe, but for
his brethren, that he might con|quer,
communicate, and con|serue
vnto vs a most sure saluati|on:
for so long as hee who haue
obtained it, cannot loose it, so
long wee are sure it cannot be
lost vnto vs, seeing of him, and
in him we possesse it.</P>
<P>And as for <HI>Adams</HI> posteritie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our temp|tations are not exter|nall onely, but chiefly internall.</NOTE>
now since the fall, our estate is so
much by Nature the more mi|serable,
that our greatest temp|tation
comes from our inward
<PB N="134" REF="80">
corruption, so that albeit there
were no externall tempter to
tempt vs with obiects of sinne,
presented to our eyes and eares:
yet wee are tempted of our owne
concupiscence within vs. <HI>Tale
quippe est vitium malignitatis,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chris. in Math. hom. 7.</NOTE> vt
a nullo impulsa plerunque sese ipsa
praecipitet:</HI> for such is the corrup|tion
of our wicked Nature, saith
<HI>Chrysostome,</HI> that although it be
not moued or enforced by any
other; yet it runneth headlong
into sinne; thus wee are like vnto
a besieged citie, that not onely
hath strong enemies without pur|suing
it, but in like manner
false Traytors within, to betray it.
Now haue wee seene how the
temptations of Christ Iesus doe
differ from <HI>Adams,</HI> and ours.</P>
<P>The other thing in this cir|cumstance
that comes to be con|sidered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The endes why Christ was temp.</NOTE>
<PB N="135" REF="80">
is the endes for which
our Lord humbles himselfe to be
tempted of Sathan: and those we
shall see doe most of all respect
vs; as for our cause he was in car|nate,
so for our cause hee was
tempted: all that hee suffered in
our Nature, are medicines to
cure the infirmities of our na|ture.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">First that he might ouercome our enemy in a iust and lawful manner.</NOTE> then hee was content to
be tempted by our enemie, that
hee might ouercome our enemie,
and that in so iust, and lawfull a
manner, as against which the ene|mie
could haue no exception, for
in mans nature hee encountred
with him, in a place conuenient
for Sathanin a state and condition
most subiect to temptation, wan|ting
all necessaries for refresh|ment
of his body, and hauing
none to comfort him; and no
<PB N="136" REF="81">
doubt it did wonderfully astonish,
and confound, <HI>that euill one,</HI> that
hauing ouercome so many since
the beginning of the world, now
hee encounters with a man, ouer
whom hee hath so many appa|rant
vantages, and against whom
he assayed all his temptations, yet
can hee not any way fasten his
sting in him.</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Secondly, to let vs see how Sathan is a spitefull enemy of mans sal|uation.</NOTE> to let vs see what a
spitefull enemie of mans salua|tion
Sathan is, for the hatred he
beares to the glory of God, hee
hates man, made to the image of
God, and doth all that hee can
to hinder his saluation. <HI>Non enim
vult vt ibi simus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. hom. 38.</NOTE> vnde ipse deie|ctus
est:</HI> for hee can not abide
that man should be exalted to
that place, from which for his
sinne hee was deiected. If wee
could apprehend this, and take
<PB N="137" REF="81">
it to heart; what a deadly enemie
Sathan is vnto vs, and for what
cause, it would encourage vs to
make stronger resistance to him
then we doe.</P>
<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thirdly, that hee might teach vs how to fight with Sathan.</NOTE> hee vndergoeth this
temptation to teach vs, his Ser|uants
and Souldiours, how to en|counter
with him, <HI>Pugnat Impe|rator,
vt discant Milites:</HI> and there|withall
to assure vs, that if wee
wil fight against him in the might
of our Lord, it is possible, that we
(clothed with this same nature)
shall ouercome him. Since the
dayes of <HI>Adam</HI> Sathan, by sinne,
hath wonderfully preuailed ouer
men: none haue escaped him
without a wound; and many hath
he slaine vnto the death: but now
in the same nature, the Lord Iesus
wrastles with him, and ouercomes
him;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theodoret. dial. 1. cap. 28.</NOTE> that so, <HI>radicitus euelleret de|sperationem
<PB N="138" REF="82">
ex natura a nostra;</HI> that
hee might plucke vp desperation
by the roote, out of our nature.</P>
<P>And fourthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fourthly, that hee might comfort vs in our tempta|tions.</NOTE> hee humbled
himselfe to suffer temptation, that
by experience hee might learne
wherein the strength of Sathan
lyeth; and so might be the more
able to succour vs in all tempta|tions:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 9. 11.</NOTE>
<HI>For, wee haue not an High
Priest, that cannot be touched with
the feeling of our infirmities; but
was in all things tempted in like
sort, yet without sinne, and there|fore
is able sufficiently to haue com|passion
on vs.</HI></P>
<P>And,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lastly, that wee should not appre|hend our tempta|tions to come from an angry God.</NOTE> last of all, that we should
not apprehend our tentations to
come from an angry God, as
commonly of our weakenesse we
doe: wee see here, that the Lord
Iesus, who a little before, was
proclaimed to be the Sonne of
<PB N="139" REF="82">
GOD, in whom the Father was
well pleased, is now led by the
Spirit of God, to be tempted of
Sathan.</P>
<P>The fift Circumstance is of
him that tempteth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fift circum|stance is of the person that temp|teth.</NOTE> called by S.
<HI>Luke,</HI> the <HI>Diuell;</HI> and, by S. <HI>Ma|thew,</HI>
the <HI>Tempter:</HI> stiles, both of
them properly belonging to Sa|than:
for, before him there was
no tempter vnto euill, nor yet af|ter
him, except such as are temp|ted
by him: wherefore <HI>Augustine</HI>
doth thus prettily describe him:
<HI>Quid est diabolus?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. in Vi|gil. natiuit. Dom. Ser. 4.</NOTE> Angelus per su|perbiam
&agrave; Deo separatus, &agrave; semetipso
ceptus, alios decipiens, author men|dacij,
radix malitiae, caput scele|rum,
princeps omnium vitiorum:</HI>
What is the Diuell?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sathan properly called a Tempter, and why.</NOTE> Hee is an
Angell, through his pride, separa|ted
from God, deceiued by him|selfe,
deceiuing others, the Father
<PB N="140" REF="83">
of lyes, the roote of malice, the
chiefe head of all wickednesses,
the Prince of all sinnes and vices.
In tempting hee is restlesse, spa|ring
no time, no place, no person.
It may truely be said of him,
which without a reason <HI>Esau</HI> said
of <HI>Iacob; was he not iustly called Ia|cob?</HI>
that is, a supplanter: <HI>for
first hee stole my Birth-right, and
now hee would steale my blessing.</HI>
Is not Sathan iustly called a
Tempter? By our first Creation,
wee were made to the Image of
God, and that Sathan by temp|ting
our parents, subtlely stole
from vs; and now the blessing of
God, in Christ the Redeemer,
whereby he offers to aduance vs
to a better estate then that where|in
wee were created, hee laboreth
by crafty temptations, to steale
from vs also. The Lord giue vs
<PB N="141" REF="83">
eyes to see his enmitie against vs,
and hearts to resist him.</P>
<P>But let vs marke that hee is
called a Tempter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sathan a Comman|der of the wicked, a Tempter of the godly.</NOTE> chiefly in re|spect
of the godly: for in regard
of the wicked, he is not so much
a tempter, as a commander and
possessour of them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ephes. 2. 2.</NOTE> <HI>he is the Prince
of the aire, that rules in the chil|dren
of disobedience:</HI> They are al|ready
in <HI>the snare of the Diuell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Tim. 2. 26</NOTE>
taken of him at his will.</HI> World|lings
count it strange to heare
that any of Gods children should
be tempted by Sathan, and think
all well enough, if in word they
can say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Carnall men in word de|spise Sa|than, but in deede doe serue him.</NOTE> <HI>I defie the Diuell and all
his workes;</HI> but Sathan cares not
how thou despight him in words,
if so be thou pleasure him in thy
workes, as those miserable men
doe, who in word defie him and
his workes, but in deed are ready
<PB N="142" REF="84">
to serue and pleasure him in any
sinfull worke, whereunto he em|ployes
them: they can abhorre
to heare others are tempted who
yet resist him, but cannot lament
that themselues, in most misera|ble
manner, are possessed and
captiued by him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two sorts of Sathans operations</NOTE> For, there are
two of Sathans operations, one is
called, <GAP DESC="foreign">, and this expres|seth
his restlesse assaulting of the
godly, to tempt them: the other
is called <GAP DESC="foreign">, expres|sing
his effectuall power, where|by
at his will hee worketh in the
children of disobedience.</P>
<P>We are not therefore to faint,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why wee should not faint at Sa|thans ten|tations.</NOTE>
because we finde our selues temp|ted
by Sathan; but rather, as <HI>S.
Iames</HI> commands vs, <HI>to count it
exceeding great ioy when we fall in|to
tentation:</HI> for, first of all, it
proues wee are none of his. As
<PB N="143" REF="84">
a dogge doth not barke at those
that are of the houshold, but at
strangers; so, Sathan keepes a
close mouth to such as are his,
and suffers them to brooke a false
peace; but such as by grace are
deliuered from his bondage,
those he compasseth like a roring
Lion, seeking to deuoure them.</P>
<P>And next, there is great profit,
and vtilitie, redounding to vs by
the tentations of Sathan: they
humble vs, chase vs to God, and
make vs more feruent in prayer.
That which <HI>Luther</HI> marked in
himselfe by experience (that <HI>Ten|tation,
Meditation,</HI> and <HI>Prayer,</HI>
were the three maisters, vnder
whom hee profited most) all the
rest of Gods children also finde
true in themselues:<NOTE PLACE="marg">It is a great tempta|tion not to be temp|ted.</NOTE> <HI>maxima ten|tatio
est non tentari;</HI> not to be
tempted is the greatest tempta|tion.
<PB N="144" REF="85">
And herein doth the maruel|lous
power and wisedome of our
God appeare, in ouer-ruling Sa|than
so farre, that his tentations
to euill, whereby hee assaults vs,
the Lord turnes them to good:
<HI>Fit enim mira diuinae bonitatis
dispensatione,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gregor. mo|ral. lib. 2.</NOTE> vt vnde malignus
hostis, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">or tentat, vt interimat;

by the wonderfull dispensation of
Gods goodnes, that from whence
the malicious enemie tempteth
the heart, to kill it; from thence
doth the mercifull God instruct
it, that it may liue.</P>
<P>But as the one Euangelist cal|leth
him a <HI>Tempter,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sathan ex|pressed by many names, for the great wickednes of his na|ture.</NOTE> so the other
calleth him a <HI>Diuell.</HI> There is not
one name sufficient to expresse the
wickednesse of Sathan; neyther
any creature so euill as is able to
<PB N="145" REF="85">
shadow it: and therefore Gods
spirit expresses it by many names,
calling him, a Dragon, a Lyon,
a Serpent, a Sathan, a Tempter, a
Diuell, a Circumuenter, a Decei|uer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Cor. 2. 11.</NOTE>
beside many giuen him in
holy scripture.</P>
<P>All which may be reduced vnto
these three;<NOTE PLACE="marg">They all may be reduced to three, for he is in all his actions either a Tempter, or an Ac|cuser, or a Tormen|ter.</NOTE> wherein he is conti|nually
exercised: for first, he is a
<HI>Tempter,</HI> entising man vnto sinne,
and there hee behaues himselfe
like a subtle warbling serpent, full
of wiles to beguile: Secondly,
hee is an <HI>Accuser,</HI> accusing man
to God for sinne, and there hee
shewes himselfe a Sathan, a hate|full
Aduersarie, and a <HI>Diuell.</HI>
Thirdly, hee is a <HI>Tormenter</HI> of
man for sinne, and there hee
imitates a fierie Dragon, and a
roring Lyon: there are the points
of his occupation, there is the
<PB N="146" REF="86">
labour, whereinto night and day
he is exercised; he likes no other,
he can doe no other:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A singula Preserua|tiue against Sathan his temptati|ons.</NOTE> If we could
remember this, it might serue
to vs as a singular preseruatiue,
to keepe vs from his subtle
snares: for why doth hee tempt
vs? is it not that hee may haue
matter whereupon to accuse vs
to our GOD, and why accuseth
he vs? but that if he can, he may
receiue power and commission, to
torment vs. O faithlesse traytor,
that first tempts a man to sinne,
and then for those same sinnes
done, by his instigation, the
first accuser of him vnto God:
and therefore if wee be wise, let
vs resist him in the first, giue no
place to him, when he is a temp|ter,
so shall we not feare him, when
he is an accuser, nor feele him as
a tormenter.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="86">The last circumstance premit|ted
here by the Euangelist,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The last circum|stance is the occasi|on of the temptati|on, to wit, his fasting.</NOTE> is the
occasion of the temptation, to

that he had fasted forty dayes:
this fasting our Sauiour also vn|dertooke,
partly for our instructi|on,
and partly, for confirmation
of his calling vnto vs; first, for
our instruction, to teach vs, that
a spirituall life, wherein God may
be honoured,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A spirituall life is greatly helped by fasting and prayer.</NOTE> our owne saluati|on,

nor continued, without absti|nence

by these haue they confoun|ded
the conspiracies of their ene|mies,
as yee may see in <HI>Esther:</HI>
these haue beene alway the most
<PB N="148" REF="87">
effectuall armour of the Church,
to diuert euill, to draw downe

to confirme themselues, and the
one of these strengthens the other.

Prayer obtained strength to fast:
Fasting obtaineth grace to pray:

<P>And therefore it is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">By the contrarie, carnall lusts are nourished by intem|perance.</NOTE> that Sa|than,
where hee will entise any to
a carnall conuersation, doth com|monly
beginne at the contrarie,

hee drew <HI>Lot</HI> to incest: <HI>Nabal</HI> to
railing against <HI>Dauid: Beltasar</HI> to
blasphemous abusing those ves|sels,
which were sacred to the Lord;
and many a man to that shame,
<PB N="149" REF="87">
wherein he thought neuer to haue
fallen; for drunkennes is Sathans
<HI>Dalilah,</HI> wherby he takes away the
strength from the strongest <HI>Sam|son,</HI>
and so he makes a play-foole of
him. Experience hath alway pro|ued,
that where this sinne is wel|come,
it is easy for sathan to bring
in any other sinne, whereunto the
Nature of that man is inclined.</P>
<P>But this fasting of our Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christs miracu|lous fast|ing was al|so to con|firme his doctrine.</NOTE> be|ing
miraculous, let vs see, that
hee vndertooke it for this ende
also, for which hee wrought all
the rest of his myracles: namely,
to confirme his calling and do|ctrine
to vs: so then as <HI>Moses</HI> at
the giuing of the Law, fasted
forty dayes: and <HI>Elias</HI> at the re|storing
of the Law, fasted forty
dayes: the Lord Iesus also com|ming
to preach the Gospel, fastes
forty dayes: partly, that he might
<PB N="150" REF="88">
answere the former types, in them
figuring what hee was to doe,
and partly as I said, to confirme
vnto vs, the certaintie of his cal|ling.</P>
<P>Whereof it is euident,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christs fast super|stitiously abused by Papists.</NOTE> how
this fact of Christ is vainely, and
superstitiously abused by the Pa|pists,
for confirmation of their
Lenton fastings, they lay this for
a ground, that <HI>Instructio ecclesiae
est omnis Christi actio:</HI> euery acti|on
of Christ, is the churches in|struction:
which helpes them no|thing,
it is true, all his actions
are for our instruction, but not
all for our imitation.</P>
<P>The workes of Christ our Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The acti|ons of Christ re|duced.</NOTE>
are of three rankes: the first are
workes of redemption, as that he <MILESTONE N="1">
was conceiued of the holy Ghost,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Workes of redempti|on, to fol|low these were blas|phemie.</NOTE>
borne of the Virgin Mary, cru|cified
on the crosse for our sinnes,
<PB N="151" REF="88">
dead, descended to hell, and rose
againe the third day: these are
so proper to the Sonne of God,
the Lord Iesus; that if any man
would presume to counterfet him
in them, he were to be abhorred,
as a most wicked blasphemer.</P>
<P>In the second ranke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Workes of miraeles: to follow him in these is im|possibility.</NOTE> are his <MILESTONE N="2">
workes of miracles, as, that he
clensed the Leper, healed the pa|ralitique,
gaue sight to the blinde,
raised the dead, and such like, but
no man is so foolish, as to say
these stands to vs for rules of
imitation: for how euer he hath
giuen power to many of his ser|uants
to doe the like of these, for
confirmation of his Gospell: yet
haue others also receiued power,
to doe such miraculous workes;
who for all that shall neuer enter
into his kingdome.</P>
<P>In the third ranke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Morall workes: to follow him in these is pietie.</NOTE> are his
<PB N="152" REF="89">
workes morall of a godly life and
conuersation: such as his humi|litie
in washing his Disciples feete:
his meekenes, patience, and loue,
in praying for his enemies; his
subiection to his Parents: and
these indeede stand vnto vs for
rules of imitation. Learne of me
saith our Sauiour, that I am low|ly
and meeke; hee bade vs not,
said <HI>Augustine,</HI> learne of him how
to make the world, or how to
raise the dead; but learne of him
that hee is lowly and meeke. To
striue to follow him in the first
ranke of these, is blasphemie: In
the second is impossibilitie: In
the third, is true pietie.</P>
<P>Now we are to know that fast|ing
is either supernaturall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fasting is of sundry sorts, ac|cording to the endes thereof.</NOTE> and so
miraculous, as the fasting of <HI>Mo|ses,
Elias,</HI> and our Lord; or na|turall:
the naturall againe is pre|scribed
<PB N="153" REF="89">
and vndertaken, either for
physicke, for ciuill affaires, or for
religion: Of the first I speake no|thing,
saue only that it is a shame
that men for bodily health can
take them to a dyet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A warning for careles Christians.</NOTE> vse mode|ration,
&amp; abstinence from meate,
who for spirituall health will no
way regard it: As for the second,
that worldlings to redeeme the
time of their market, or otherwise
to ouertake their ciuill affaires,
can fast from morne to euening,
condemnes in like manner care|lesse
Christians, who to make vn|to
themselues encrease in the
gaine of godlinesse, will not de|dicate
any time to the exercises
of fasting and praying: As for the
third, fasting for religion, it is ei|ther
publike, such as by publike
authoritie is enioyned for vrgent
causes: as that of <HI>Hester</HI> and <HI>Io|saphat:</HI>
<PB N="154" REF="90">
or else priuate; such as
priuate Christians, either by
themselues, or with their families,
doe willingly vndertake.</P>
<P>Now in both these,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The right end of re|ligious fast|ing is, to subdue the body by discipline.</NOTE> we are al|waies
to take heed, that fasting be
vsed for the right end, and in the
right manner. Then it is vsed to
the right end, when we fast for
this cause, that the flesh being
subdued to the Spirit, may be the
more able to pray. As a naturall
man delights in the subduing of

subduing of his flesh.<NOTE PLACE="marg">In the bat|tell be|tweene the flesh and spirit, vve should helpe that partie which we would haue victo|rious.</NOTE> In a battell

<P>This being the ende,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rules in fasting: first that it be without opinion of merit.</NOTE> which in
fasting should be proposed vnto
vs, let vs beware of those euils,
that may corrupt it, and we shall
finde it a most wholesome medi|cine
for a diseased soule And first
let vs beware of the opinion of
merit before God: for this con|ceit
makes euen good workes
an abhomination to the Lord;
as it is euident in that Pharisie,
<PB N="156" REF="91">
who boasting of his almes, and
fasting, went home without mer|cy
and grace.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ber. in Cant. Ser. 67.</NOTE> <HI>Non enim habet quo

There is no place for Grace
to enter in, where merite hath

<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Next that it be with|out super|stition.</NOTE> we are to take heede
that our fasting be without super|stition,
which then is done, <HI>quan|do
neque propter aliquorum imita|tionem
fit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Epiph haeres. 33.</NOTE> nec propter consuetudi|nem,
nec propter diem, velut dies
hoc praescrib at:</HI> when it is done nei|ther
for imitation of any other,
nor for custome, nor for the day,
as if the day should prescribe the
same: such is the fasting of
many, vndertaken for such a
day, or such a custome, and not
for cause of conscience: such fast|ing
is plaine superstition.</P>
<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thirdly that it be not with|out prayer: to fast, and not to pray is to offer a dead thing to the Lord.</NOTE> that it be not without
<PB N="157" REF="91">
prayer. Fasting is good, but such
a good as in religion is not to
be vsed for it selfe, but for ano|ther
good; namely for prayer:
therefore the spirit of God ioynes
these together, fasting and prayer:
for fasting without prayer is like a
dead body without a spirit, and to
offer such a fasting vnto the Lord
is no lesse abhomination, then if
vnder the Law, any man should
haue offered a dead thing vnto
him: and this is also for them
who make not the dayes of fast|ing,
dayes of prayer, I meane
who are no more instant in pray|er
that day wherein they fast,
then other dayes wherin they fast
not; vainely conceiting, that fast|ing
by it selfe, should commend
them to God.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fourthly, that it be without ostenta|tion.</NOTE></P>
<P>Fourthly, let fasting be without
ostentation before men: Our Sa|uiour
<PB N="158" REF="92">
fasted in secret, in the wil|dernesse,
where none saw him.
In cities, and in the company of
men, he did eate and drinke, and
this commandement hath he gi|uen
vs, <HI>when ye fast looke not sowre,
as hypocrites doe, who disfigure their
faces, that they may be seene of men
to fast: but when thou fastest an|noint
thine head, and wash thy feet,
that thou seeme not vnto men to
fast, but vnto thy father, who is in
secret, and thy father who sees thee
secretly, will reward thee openly.</HI>
But, this condemned hypocrisie is
now counted good deuotion&punc; both
among Papists, and carnall pro|fessors;

all those who knowes them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fiftly, that amend|ment of life, be ioy|ned with it.</NOTE></P>

<P>The temptations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How these temptati|ons are di|stingui|shed.</NOTE> by sundry,

</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Then.</HEAD>
<P>SAthans first temptation is to
Desperation:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The time, and occa|sion of temptati|on well obserued by Sathan.</NOTE> wherein taking
vantage of Christs bodily wants,
hee labours to perswade him to
doubt and distrust that hee was
the Sonne of God; the time of it

he was hungry. Sathan can very
well obserue the time, and occa|sion
of temptations; hee temp|ted
not <HI>Euah,</HI> when she was with
<HI>Adam;</HI> hee tempted not <HI>Dauid,</HI>
when hee was in trouble; hee
tempted not <HI>Peter</HI> in the com|pany

and wee should looke the more

</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Diuell said vnto him;</HEAD>
<P>SAthan is called the <HI>Diuell,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">What a false and crafty Ca|lumniator Sathan is.</NOTE> be|cause
hee is a great Calumnia|tor,

can hee commend to God
the good of any of his Saints. If
hee know any good in them, hee
extenuates it, or speakes euill of it;
if hee know any euill, he enlarges
it: and so desirous is he to speake
euill of vs, that rather then want,
hee will faine. Whereby we may
gather how glad hee is when wee

</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="167" REF="96">
<HEAD>If thou be the Sonne of God.</HEAD>
<P>HIs purpose here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In the left wing of Sathans battell fights de|speration.</NOTE> is to im|pugne
that notable Oracle
sounded from heauen at Christs
Baptisme: <HI>This is my beloued Son,
in whom I am well pleased:</HI> so said
the Father, but this cannot be,
now, saith Sathan; that voice hath
beene but a delusion: for, the
Sonne of God is the heire of all
things, and hath the Angels for
his ministers and Seruants; but it
is not so with thee; for, here thou
art among wilde beasts, in great
necessitie, like to perish for hun|ger.</P>
<P>The temptation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two branches of the first re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ration.</NOTE> if wee marke
it narrowly, hath two branches,
and in them both Sathan shootes
at one end, which is, to driue
Christ to distrust, or else to doubt
<PB N="168" REF="97">
whether he be the Sonne of God
or no; or else to remedie his pre|sent
hunger by conuerting stones
into bread; and so to limit the
Lord, and bound his prouidence;
as if by no other means the Lord
could sustaine him, but by bread
onely; or as if hee could make
bread no other way but of stones
onely: and therefore, neyther will
our Sauiour graunt the first, nor

</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="169" REF="97">
<HEAD>If thou be the Sonne of God.</HEAD>
<P>SAthan knew that Iesus was the
Sonne of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sathan of his great malice fights a|gainst his knowne light.</NOTE> and afterwards
hee confesseth it; yet such is the
malice of his nature, that hee
fighteth against his knowne light.
Hee knew that God had forbid|den
<HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Euah</HI> to eate of the
Tree: hee knew that if they did
eate they should die; yet was hee
bold to perswade them the con|trary.
And that which by an Hi|storicall
Faith he beleeueth him|selfe,
hee perswadeth his wretch|ed
captiues, eyther to deny it,
as a false thing; or to doubt of it,
as an vncertaine thing. Hee be|leeueth
there is a God, and trem|bleth;
but how many Fooles are
there in the world, blinded by
him, who haue said in their harts,
<PB N="170" REF="98">
<HI>There is no God.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">And his Schollers professe points of Atheisme, which himselfe dares not auouch.</NOTE> Hee beleeueth
there is a Iudgement to come,
wherein greater torment abideth
him, then yet is laid vpon him;
and yet he perswadeth his Infidels
to scorne and mocke at it, as a
thing which neuer will be. Thus
as the Pharisies made their Pro|selytes
tenne times more the chil|dren
of the Diuell then them|selues;
so, Sathan makes his schol|lers
professe points of Atheisme
which himselfe durst neuer a|uouch,
and to misbeleeue some
points of Religion, which hee
himselfe beleeueth to be true.</P>
<P>Now if Sathan durst call this
in doubt to Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our Ele|ction <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span"> Sathan.</NOTE> whether or
no hee was the Sonne of God,
what maruell if he dare call the

for this cause tempts hee
<PB N="171" REF="98">
man to sinne, that man may fur|nish
him arguments to proue
that man is not the Son of God.
He could not be content that the
first <HI>Adam</HI> should liue in Paradise,
and farre lesse that <HI>Adams</HI> poste|ritie
should be exalted to inherit
those heauenly places which hee
lost by pride: and therefore ey|ther
by tempting him to sinne,
doth he prease to hold him backe
from the dignitie of the Sonne
of God: or, if so hee cannot, then
troubles hee him with doubting
of his Calling and Election, ma|king
him to mis-conceiue, that
such a miserable man as hee can|not
be the Sonne of God.</P>
<P>And the reasons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The argu|ment in those ten|tations that Sa|than vseth, is taken from our wants.</NOTE> which in this
tentation commonly he vseth are
taken from our wants, spirituall, or
corporall: for, concerning spiri|tuall
desertions; wherein wee are
<PB N="172" REF="99">
troubled with the sight of our sins,
and want, for the present, the sense
of mercy, then his reasoning is,
It cannot be that thou art one of
Gods Elect; for, they are not or|dained
to wrath, but to mercy; if
thou wert so, then should the fauo|rable
face of God be toward thee,
and thou shouldest not be vexed
as thou art, with the sense of his
wrath.</P>
<P>In all this he is but a false de|ceiuer:<NOTE PLACE="marg">First, from want of spirituall grace in time of desertion.</NOTE>
for, was not the Lord Ie|sus
troubled with the same tem|porall
desertion, when hee cryed;
<HI>My God, my God, why hast thou for|saken
me?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 27. 46</NOTE> and yet notwithstand|ing
he was the beloued Sonne of
God: and that this many times
is the manner of his working with
his owne children, hee declares
himselfe; <HI>For a little time in mine
anger haue I forsaken thee, but with
<PB N="173" REF="99">
euerlasting compassion will I imbrace
thee.</HI></P>
<P>Again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Next, from the vvant of worldly necessaries</NOTE> out of the want of worldly
necessaries, so he reasons with ma|ny;
thou hast beene so long in sick|nes,
daily crying for deliuerance,
yet the Lord hath not heard thee;
thou art vexed with pouertie, and
prayest euery day for daily bread,
but it is not giuen vnto thee; sure|ly
this is because thou art none
of his, hee is not thy Father, ney|ther
hath he any fauour towards
thee, nor cares hee for thee: but
herein also hee is a deceiuer.</P>
<P>For,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The dig|nitie of Gods sons stands not in aboun|dance of worldly things.</NOTE> the dignitie of Gods Sons,
stands not in the aboundance of

his fauour or anger to be mea|sured

<PB N="174" REF="100">
let vs beware vpon our wants to

but that man liues not by bread
onely.</P>
<P>Of this first we learne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the first we learne that second meanes or|dained by God, should not be despi|sed.</NOTE> that the
second meanes, appointed by
God, are not to be despised: for
we see our Sauiour in this disputa|tion
with Sathan, excludes them
not: for in the right vse of them,
the power, wisedome, prouidence,
and goodnes of God are praised,
who hath prouided so many good
things, for the good of man, and
hath giuen power vnto things
without life, to helpe the life of
man. And this I marke, first, for
weake Christians, who are so farre
abused by Sathan sometime, that
they thinke it not lawfull for them
to eate and drinke, and to nou|rish
that body,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This serues first for weake Christi|ans who through errour of conscience defraud their bo|dies of necessary foode.</NOTE> wherein sinne is
harboured against the Lord: it is
true indeede euery christian ought
to haue a care, that the nourish|ment
<PB N="185" REF="105">
of the body, become not
a nourishment of sinne in the bo|dy,
but so that thou runne not
to the other extremitie, to ac|count
that euill, which God hath
ordained for thy good. Certaine|ly
as Sathan enuies that thou
should enioy the fauour of thy
GOD; so enuies hee that thou
shouldst enioy the comfortable
vse of any creature that euer God
made: yea, euen of meate and
drinke. Where he cannot tempt
thee to the abuse of it by intem|perancie,
hee doth what he can to
defraude thee of it, working vpon
thy weake conscience, makes thee
to conceiue a scrupple, where
there is none, and bindes thee
there, where God hath made thee
free.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Next for idle men who neg|lect the ordinarie meanes by which they should liue.</NOTE> And next the vse of the

who are desirous to liue, wanting
<PB N="186" REF="106">
nothing necessary for their life,
but they wil not work: these, as af|terward
followes, are tempters of
God, despising the meanes, they
will eyther be fed miraculously
by the hand of God, as Israel was
in the wildernes, or else impiou|sly
will seeke their foode by vn|lawfull
shifts, out of the hands of
Sathan.</P>
<P>Next wee learne that howeuer
the second meanes are to be vsed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And yet we should not trust in the second meanes, but in God.</NOTE>
yet are wee not to trust in them:
as if it were they, and not Gods
blessing, that did helpe our life.
Physicke is good, but because
<HI>Asa</HI> trusted in it, it could not
profit him. And flesh is good for
nourishment, but because Israel
thought that their life was in it,
GOD slew them by the same
meane by which they thought to
liue: and therefore the Lord to
<PB N="187" REF="106">
teach men that the vertue is not
in the meanes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who sometime workes without meanes, sometime by small meanes, and some|time makes the meanes of life in|struments of death.</NOTE> but in his blessing.
Sometime hee workes without
meanes, as when hee made light
without the Sun, fertilitie of the
earth without raine; when hee
kept the life of <HI>Moses</HI> without
meate, and made cornes grow vn|to
<HI>Ezechia</HI> without sowing: and
sometimes to small meanes hee
giues great vertue; as when hee
made one paire of shooes, and
one sute of raiment, last Israel for|ty
yeares. There were many in the
daies of <HI>Elisha,</HI> who had more
oyle and meale then the widdow
of <HI>Sarepta</HI> had, but wanted the
blessing; shee had, and therefore
was theirs spent, when her
portion, being lesse, remained to
the ende.</P>
<P>Beside this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The na|ture of the second meanes proues that our life is not by them.</NOTE> the very nature of
the meanes which wee vse, may
<PB N="188" REF="107">
teach vs, it is not they that pre|serues
our life; for they being
things without life themselues,
and such as by time putrifies and
rots, what life can they giue or
keep vnto vs? Or if they be things
endued with life, we see that they
must first loose their life, before
they become helpes of our life,
to teach vs that howeuer by them
we liue; yet in them is not that
vertue, that conserues our life.</P>
<P>Last of all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Experience also con|firmes the same.</NOTE> experience con|firmes
it; if bread preserued the
life, then they who are best fed
would be most liuely, but we see
the contrary: more lusty was <HI>Da|niel</HI>
vpon his potage, then the
other children were on the kings
delicates. <HI>Dauid</HI> in his old daies
wanted no couerings nor gar|ments,
but none of them could
get heate to his body. We see by
<PB N="189" REF="107">
experience, some consuming
more then may content other
three, yet in the midst of wealth
they dwyne away; and poore la|bourers
feeding on the refuse of
bread and water, more strong and

it is not the meanes which
preserue the life, but how it is

<P>THat is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This is made more cleare out of the se|cond part of Christs answere.</NOTE> by euery decree and

thee for a long time, so it shall

how that the life of man hangs

<HI>Thou turnest man to destruction:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 90. 3.</NOTE>

<PB N="191" REF="108">
feares not offend the Lord, from

<P>And next wee learne here how
to remedie our faithlesse cares,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Comfort when or|dinarie meanes failes.</NOTE>
when either ordinarie meanes

Wherein Sathan keepes
a course plaine contrarie to the
first:<NOTE PLACE="marg">In the right wing of Sathans battell stands Pre|sumption.</NOTE> in the former he tempted to
Desperation, thy poor &amp; indigent
estate proues thou canst not be the
Sonne of God: in this hee tempts
to presumption. If thou be sure that
thou art the Son of God, then doe
what thou wilt, nothing can harme
thee. Thus Sathan assaults not the
godly alwayes with one tempta|tion,
but can craftily change them
for his owne aduantage: such as
hee cannot draw to one extremi|tie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sathan changes tentations for his owne ad|uantage.</NOTE>
he labours to draw to another:
and albeit by this craft hee pre|uailed
nothing with the Sonne
of GOD: yet doth hee many
time by it speede among men.
<PB N="193" REF="109">
There are some whom he can not
moue to be carelesse in religion,
and them he tempts to the other
extremitie, to be superstitious in
religion: some whom he cannot
induce to shake off conscience, yet
hee makes scrupulous in consci|ence,
doubting where they neede
not; and so of other temptations:
for the which wee haue neede to
be armed with the armour of God
on the right hand and on the left.</P>
<P>This temptation Saint <HI>Luke</HI>
makes the third: <HI>S. Mathew</HI> the
second: but the difference is no|thing,
for in the Euangelists descri|bing
this History of Christ, doe
not so much stand vpon the pre|cise
order of the times, as vpon
the substance, &amp; matter of things
which were done.</P>
<P>In the first assault we haue seene
how our Lord did ouerthrow Sa|thans
<PB N="194" REF="110">
first Captaine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sathans second captaine ouer|throwne also by our Lord.</NOTE> <HI>Desperation,</HI>
with his followers. Now we shall
see how in the other wing of Sa|thans
armie, hee ouercomes his
second Captaine, <HI>Presumption,</HI>
with his followers.</P>
<P>Wherein the time first is no|ted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">After vi|ctory in any temp|tation let vs stand ready for a new battel.</NOTE>
<HI>Then:</HI> that this temptation
ensued vpon the end of the for|mer;
learning vs after victorie
gotten in any battell against Sa|than,
not to fall into securitie, but
to stand still in our armour, ex|pecting
another assault: In bodi|ly
conflicts, securitie after victorie
hath many times brought destru|ction
to mighty armies: the A|malekites
(sitting downe to eate
and drinke, after the burning of
<HI>Ziklag,</HI> suddenly in their securi|tie,
ouerthrowne by the sword of
<HI>Dauid</HI>) may stand for a proofe of
it: but in the spirituall battell
<PB N="195" REF="110">
it is much more dangerous.</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christs transporta|tion whe|ther men|tall or cor|porall.</NOTE> the place is descri|bed;
<HI>the holy Citie, Ierusalem:</HI> where
first wee haue to consider, how it
is that Sathan carryes him vnto
it, whether was this transporta|tion
mentall or corporall? The
first I denie; for, it could not be,
that our Sauiours imagination
could be so farre abused, as that
he should thinke he was carried,
when he was not caryed; nothing
in him could be deceiued. All his
tentations (as I said) were exter|nall
onely, and proceeded not to
the mouing or affecting any of his
internall faculties; and therefore
I agree vnto the second, that this
transportation was corporall.</P>
<P>Where,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Offences that may arise of Christs corporall</NOTE> if it be offensiue to any
of Gods Children to heare that
our Sauiours blessed body should
be handled and carried from
<PB N="196" REF="111">
place to place by that vncleane
Spirit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">transporta|tion remo|ued.</NOTE> let them consider that this
was done, not against his will, but
with his owne will: as afterward
willingly hee was lead, by Sa|thans
members, like a sheepe to
the slaughter, so now willingly
is he carried by Sathans selfe,
to be tempted of him; and that
for the greater glory of his owne
name, greater confusion of Sa|than,
and greater comfort of his
children.</P>
<P>The Lord Iesus permits the ad|uersarie
to handle his holy body,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In it the inuincible power of our Lord is made manifest.</NOTE>
to carry it, for a time, to such pla|ces,
as might yeeld him greatest
vantage to tempt it; hee permits
him to speake what hee pleased,
and to shew what obiects he could
for his allurement; yea, he is con|tent
to be deliuered into the
hands of wicked men, Sathans
<PB N="197" REF="111">
instruments, and giues them li|bertie
to abuse his blessed body,
to spit vpon it, to buffet it, to
scourge it, to crucifie it, and yet
for all that hee could doe, either
by himselfe, or by his members,
he can neuer preuaile against the
Lord Iesus. Certainely the more
liberty Sathan had granted to
him, in all this, the greater was his
owne shame and confusion; and
the more manifest the glory of
our inuincible captaine, who can|not
be ouercome, nay not when
he is in the hands of his very ene|mies.</P>
<P>Againe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Comfort for Gods children, whose bo|dies are afflicted by Sathan for a time.</NOTE> this is for the comfort
of Gods children, for sometime
power is giuen to Sathan ouer
their bodies, to afflict them, as
we see for a time in <HI>Iob,</HI> or for a
time to possesse them, as hee did
the body of <HI>Magdalen</HI> (for albeit
<PB N="198" REF="112">
then shee was not called: yet
euen then was shee an elect wo|man)
least therefore the children
of God should at any time be dis|couraged
with the like of this, to
take it for an argument of repro|bation,
or finall deliuery of them
vnto Sathan, that the Lord for
a time permits him to haue pow|er
our their bodies, the Lord Ie|sus
who would in all things be
tempted as we are, except sinne,
did taste of this temptation also
for our comfort.</P>
<P>This being spoken concerning
the manner of his carrying:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The place of this temptati|on is Ieru|salem, the holy City.</NOTE> now
we come to the place, which is
the holy City Ierusalem; &amp; more
particularly, the very Temple,
which stood in the sight of all
Ierusalem, Sathan sets him on
the platforme of it, wherein were
turrets with pinacles on their tops,
<PB N="199" REF="112">
&amp; this place he takes as most con|uenient
for his purpose, thou hast
lurked too long as a priuate man,
among this people: if thou be the
Sonne of GOD, that promised
Messiah, the king of Israel, here
is the time and place to shew thy
selfe in the sight of Ierusalem, all
the people shall admire thee, and
acknowledge thee for to be the
Sonne of God, if thou cast thy
selfe downe among them: which
easily thou maist doe, without
all perill or harme, seeing the
Lord hath giuen his Angels
charge ouer thee, to keepe thee.</P>
<P>Concerning the place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No place on earth free from the temp|tations of Sathan.</NOTE> beside
that which we marked in the first
temptation, how that there is no
place so holy on earth, wherin we
can be free from the temptations
of this vnholy spirit: In Paradise
he tempted <HI>Adam;</HI> at Christs table
<PB N="200" REF="113">
he tempted <HI>Iudas;</HI> and in the very
Temple, dedicated to the seruice
of God, how often finde wee by

vs?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Yea, in most holy places, he is a most busie temp|ter.</NOTE> making vs eyther to turne the
house of God into an house of
marchandise, while hee drawes
away our mindes to thinke vpon
worldly affaires: or else into a den
of theeues, whilst he carryeth our
Eyes to wander after vanitie, that
so hee may infect the heart: or
else, at least, he casts vpon vs the
spirit of slumbring, that wee can|not
with reuerence heare the word
of the Lord. Sathan is an enemie
to euery good action, standing
alwayes at <HI>Iosuahs</HI> right hand to

hee resist vs in the Exerc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ses of

places, wherein wee should be

the Iewes in the building of Ie|rusalem,
had their weapon in the

that which followes, that he might
from thence cast him downe. Sa|than

vnto the Lord; for, the Lord casts
downe, to the end hee may raise

as to lament, according as hee
had cause. Alas, that euer I fell

sins into the which Sathan labors
most to draw men, finding by his

lamenting our apostasies, recoun|ting
our fore-passed sinnes, in the

the sense of peace and reconcili|ation
with God; in Christ Iesus,
may be encreased in vs.</P>
<P>And againe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Such as heare their sins con|demned by the word, and are not moued, are here con|uinced.</NOTE> here is a warning
to all senselesse and stupid hea|rers
of the Word of God, who
when they heare their sinnes con|demned,
are eyther not moued
at all, or else if they be moued,
are not mended. So <HI>Pharaoh</HI> had
some motion, and prayed <HI>Moses</HI>
to pray for him, but it was with|out
continuance, being choked
by the hardnesse of his hart. <HI>Achab</HI>
rent his cloaths, and put on Sack|cloath
at the threatning of <HI>Elias,</HI>
but his humiliation continued
<PB N="217" REF="121">
not. <HI>Foelix</HI> trembled when <HI>Paul</HI>
preached, but hee proceeded no
further. Yet euen these may con|demne
the senselesse hearers of
this age; who, after so long hea|ring,
haue beene so little moued.
And those come ouer-neare vnto
the nature of Sathan, who is so
confirmed in his sinne, that no
conuiction, made by the cleare
light of the Word of God can
moue him to repent.</P>
<P>It is farre otherwise with the
godly:<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the children of God trem+ble at the rebukes of his word.</NOTE> if the Lord speake they
tremble: if his Word condemne
any sinne in them, they fall downe
and mourne before him, till hee
forgiue it. So were the Publicanes
moued, at the preaching of <HI>Iohn</HI>
the Baptist, to cry, <HI>What shall we
doe?</HI> So were the Iewes pricked
in their hearts at the preaching
of <HI>Peter,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 2. 37.</NOTE> saying; <HI>What shall we doe?</HI>
<PB N="218" REF="122">
So cryed the Iaylor to <HI>Paul</HI> and

The word of Grace is power|full
in the hearts of the Elect,
without any great difficultie, by
whosoeuer it be preached. When
<HI>Augustines</HI> hearers with great ap|plause

vs, that then onely is Gods

<P>And thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thirdly, he abuseth Scripture, in mutila|ting of it.</NOTE> his abuse of the
Scripture appeareth in his muti|lation
of it: for, hee leaueth out
these words, <HI>In all thy wayes;</HI> be|cause

for, it is not the way of a godly
man to precipitate himselfe from
<PB N="220" REF="123">
a height, but to come downe
some ordinary way. And this is
also a piece of Sathans skill, in
tempting men, to hide from
them that which may restraine
them from sinne, and onely to let
them see that which may embol|den
them vnto it.</P>
<P>And herein also we learne how
wee should vse the promises of
Gods protection to our comfort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The pro|mises of God can be no com|forts to vs, if we neg|lect the condition wherupon they are made.</NOTE>
and not abuse them to the offence
of our God. It is true, God hath
promised protection to his Chil|dren;
but all his promises are
euer with a condition, that wee
keepe ourselues within the wayes
of God: <HI>The Lord is with you
while yee be with him.</HI> Sathan
knoweth this very well, that so
long, as men walke in the way of
God, the Lord is a hedge vnto
them, and his Angels are as a
<PB N="221" REF="123">
guard to keepe them, and there|fore
his first care is to draw them
out of the way of God, that so
spoiling them of their protector,
they may become a pray vnto
him: this is cleare in that poli|cie
which <HI>Balaam</HI> taught <HI>Balak,</HI>
and wee may see by experience,
it is the daily practise of Sathan.</P>
<P>Now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In the right vse of this testi|monie, we consider two things: First, the great glory and maie|stie of God.</NOTE> hauing seene how Sa|than

Sathan presented to our Sa|uiours

hee makes in his eare; both
tending to this end, to assay if by
them hee could infect his heart.
In his offer wee see two notable
lyes: first, saith he all these are
mine, al this power is deliuered in|to
my hands. The Psalmist saith;
<HI>The earth is the Lords,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 24. 1.</NOTE> and the
fulnesse thereof:</HI> and wee reade in
<HI>Daniel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">In this he makes two notable lyes, first in affirming that the kingdomes of the world were his.</NOTE> that honour, glory and
dominion are the Lords, he chan|ges
kingdomes, &amp;c. and this
shamelesse Beare, saies all is his:
when in very deede not so much
as any beast in the world is his,
farre lesse any kingdome thereof:
<PB N="242" REF="134">
for hee could not doe so much,
for all his pretended power, as
enter into a Sow, vntill the Lord
gaue him power.</P>
<P>Where if ye obiect vnto mee,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>How Sa|than is cal|led,</HI> The God of the world.</NOTE>
how is it then, that Sathan is cal|led
by the Apostle, the God of
this world? I answere, that is one|ly
in regard of the reprobate,
whom the Lord in iustice hath gi|uen
ouer vnto Sathan, and in
whom hee commands and workes
at his pleasure; no otherwise then
an executioner, to whom the iudge
giues power to punish a male|factor,
sometime in his goods,
sometime in his person, and
sometime by taking away of his
life: if this executioner should
vaunt that he were Lord of life
and death, or had power of health
and sicknes, riches and pouertie,
such as knew him, would not re|gard
<PB N="243" REF="134">
him. It is euen so with Sa|than,
he is but a false deceiuer:
for hee being the executioner of
God, imployed by the Lord, to
punish the wicked in their bo|dies,
in their mindes, or in their
goods, will notwithstanding beare
his blinded wretches in hand, as
if all this power were his owne.</P>
<P>The other lye hee makes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Next he lies in pre|tending that hee would giue them to Christ, which he neuer would al|beit he might.</NOTE> is
that he pretends hee would giue
all these vnto Christ, which as it
was not in his power to doe, so
was it farre from his minde: for
he enuies that man should enioy
any creature, that euer the Lord
made; so the ende will declare,
when he shall bring his miserable
captiues to such a scarsitie, and fa|mine
of all good things, that if a
drop of water might comfort
them, they shall not get it.</P>
<P>We must therefore put a diffe|rence
<PB N="244" REF="135">
betweene Sathans promi|ses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sathans promises are alwaies to be di|stinguished from his performan|ces.</NOTE>

in the one, poore in the other:

like vnto God, but hee made her
like vnto himselfe: with <HI>Laban</HI>
hee can name a <HI>Rachel,</HI> and giue a
<HI>Leah.</HI> Like <HI>Ioab</HI> hee can kisse with
the mouth, and slay with the
hand: he can promise victory to
<HI>Achah,</HI> that so he may chase him
to confusion: name what he will,
what can he giue, but a part of his
owne portion? that is, to make mi|serable
man a partaker with him
in his most fearefull condemnati|on.</P>
<P>And yet alas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Yet blinde worldlings follow Sa|than as if the world were at his donation.</NOTE> how many are

their rents by impietie, can they
reioyce with <HI>Iacob,</HI> saying with my
staffe and bagge came I ouer Ior|dan,

<HI>Iudas</HI> to doe him seruice for thir|tie

hee hire to lye, to sweare, to for|sweare,

for one very small piece of
mony: whereas againe, of others
hee esteemes so much, that hee
offers them greater things to be|come
his, as high honours, and
rich rents;<NOTE PLACE="marg">This is their shame, who doe Sathan seruice for small re|wards.</NOTE> but to none did hee
