<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE CHARLES Earl of <HI>Dorset</HI> and <HI>Middlesex, Lord Chamberlain of His Majesty's Houshold, and Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Garter,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A Young Poet, is liable to the same Vanity and Indiscretion with a Young Lover; and the Great Man that smiles upon one, and the Fine Woman that looks kindly upon t' other, are each of 'em in Danger of having the Favour publish'd with the first Opportunity.</P>
<P>But there may be a different Motive, which will a little distinguish the Offenders. For tho' one should have a Vanity in ruining another's Reputation, yet the other may only have an Ambition to advance his own.
<PB REF="4">
And I beg leave, my Lord, that I may plead the latter, both as the Cause and Excuse of this Dedication.</P>
<P>Whoever is King, is also the Father of his Country; and as no body can dispute Your Lordship's <HI>Monarchy</HI> in <HI>Poetry;</HI> so all that are concern'd, ought to acknow|ledge Your Universal Patronage: And it is only pre|suming on the Priviledge of a Loyal Subject, that I have ventur'd to make this my Address of Thanks, to Your Lordship; which at the same time, includes a Prayer for Your Protection.</P>
<P>I am not Ignorant of the Common Form of Poetical Dedications, which are generally made up of Panegyricks, where the Authors endeavour to distinguish their Pa|trons, by the shining Characters they give them, above other Men. But that, my Lord, is not my business at this time, nor is Your Lordship <HI>now</HI> to be distin|guish'd. I am contented with the Honour I do my self in this Epistle; without the Vanity of attempting to add to, or explain Your Lordship's Character.</P>
<P>I confess it is not without some strugling, that I behave my self in this Case, as I ought: For it is very hard to be pleased with a Subject, and yet forbear it. But I chuse rather to follow <HI>Pliny's</HI> Precept, than his Ex|ample, when in his Panegyrick to the Emperour <HI>Tra|jan,</HI> he says,
<Q><L>Nec minus considerabo quid aures ejus pati</L>
<L>possint, Quam quid virtutibus debeatur.</L></Q></P>
<P>I hope I may be excus'd the Pedantry of a Quota|tion, when it is so justly apply'd. Here are some Lines
<PB REF="4">
in the Print, (and which your Lordship read before this Play was Acted) that were omitted on the Stage; and particularly one whole Scene in the Third Act, which not only helps the Design forward with less Precipitation, but also heightens the ridiculous Character of <HI>Foresight,</HI> which indeed seems to be maim'd without it. But I found my self in great dan|ger of a long Play, and was glad to help it where I could. Tho' notwithstanding my Care, and the kind Reception it had from the Town; I could heartily wish it yet shorter: But the Number of Different Characters represented in it, would have been too much crowded in less room.</P>
<P>This Reflection on Prolixity, (a Fault, for which scarce any one Beauty will attone) warns me not to be tedious now, and detain Your Lordship any longer with the Trifles of,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your Lordship's Most Obedient and Most Humble Servant,
<HI>WILL. CONGREVE.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>

<L>CUSTOM, which every where bears mighty Sway,</L>

<L>But Women, you will say, are ill at Speeches,</L>
<L>'Tis true, and therefore I appear in Breeches:</L>
<L>Not for Example to you City-Wives;</L>

<L>O yes, their Gains are mightily augmented:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Making Horns wi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">h her Hands over her Head.</NOTE></L>
<L>And yet, methinks, it must havecost some Strife:</L>
<L>A Passive Husband, and an Active Wife!</L>
<L>'Tis awkward, very awkward, by my Life.</L>
<L>But to my Speech, Assemblies of all Nations</L>
<L>Still are suppos'd to open with Orations:</L>
<L>Mine shall begin, to shew our Obligations.</L>
<L><PB REF="6">To you, our Benefactors, lowly Bowing,</L>
<L>Whose Favours have prevented our undoing;</L>
<L>A long <HI>Egyptian</HI> Bondage we endur'd,</L>

<L>Our Taskmasters were grown such very <HI>Jews,</HI></L>
<L>We must at length have Play'd in Wooden Shooes,</L>
<L>Had not your Bounty taught us to refuse.</L>
<L>Freedom's of <HI>English</HI> growth, I think, alone;</L>
<L>What for lost <HI>English</HI> Freedom can attone?</L>

<L>The Soul of Pleasure, and the Sweet of Life,</L>
<L>The Woman's Charter, Widdow, Maid or Wife,</L>
<L>This they'd have cancell'd, and thence grew the Strife.</L>
<L>But you perhaps, wou'd have me here confess</L>
<L>How we obtain'd the Favour;&mdash;Can't you guess?</L>
<L>Why then I'll tell you, (for I hate a Lye)</L>
<L>By Brib'ry, errant Brib'ry, let me dye:</L>
<L>I was their Agent, but by Iove I swear</L>
<L>No honourable Member had a share</L>
<L>Tho' young and able Members bid me Fair:</L>
<L>I chose a wiser way to make you willing,</L>
<L>Which has not cost the House a single Shilling;</L>
<L>Now you suspect at least I <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter">ent a Billing.</L>
<L>You see I'm Young, and to that Air of Youth,</L>
<L>Some will add Beauty, and a little Truth;</L>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Spoken at the opening of the New House, By Mr. <HI>Betterton.</HI></HEAD>
<L>THE Husbandman in vain renews his Toil,</L>
<L>To cultivate each Year a hungry Soil;</L>
<L>And fondly hopes for rich and generous Fruit,</L>
<L>When what should feed the Tree, devours the Root:</L>
<L>Th&punc; unladen Boughs, he sees, bode certain Dearth,</L>
<L>Unless transplanted to more kindly Earth.</L>
<L>So, the poor Husbands of the Stage, who found</L>
<L>Their Labours lost upon the ungrateful Ground,</L>
<L>This last and only Remedy have prov'd;</L>
<L>And hope new Fruit from ancient Stocks remov'd.</L>
<L>Well may they hope, when you so kindly aid,</L>
<L>And plant a Soil which you so rich have made.</L>
<L>As Nature gave the World to Man's first Age,</L>
<L>So&punc; from your Bounty, we receive this Stage;</L>
<L>The Freedom Man was born to, you've restor'd,</L>
<L>And to our World, such Plenty you afford,</L>
<L>It seems like <HI>Eden,</HI> fruitful of its own accord.</L>
<L>But since in <HI>Paradise</HI> frail Flesh gave way,</L>
<L>And when but two were made, both went astray;</L>
<L>Forbear your Wonder, and the Fault forgive,</L>
<L>If in our larger Family we grieve</L>
<L>One falling <HI>Adam,</HI> and one tempted <HI>Eve.</HI></L>
<L>We who remain, would gratefully repay</L>
<L>What our Endeavours can, and bring this day,</L>
<L>The First-fruit. Offering, of a Virgin Play.</L>
<L><PB REF="7">We hope there's something that may please each Taste,</L>
<L>And tho' of Homely Fare we make the Feast,</L>
<L>Yet you will find variety at least.</L>
<L>There's Humour, which for chearful Friends we got,</L>
<L>And for the thinking Party there's a Plot.</L>
<L>We've something too, to gratifie ill Nature,</L>
<L>(If there be any here) and that is Satire.</L>
<L>Tho Satire scarce dares grin, 'tis grown so mild;</L>
<L>Or only shews its Teeth, as if it smil'd.</L>
<L>As Asses Thistles, Poets mumble Wit,</L>
<L>And dare not bite, for fear of being bit.</L>
<L>They hold their Pens, as Swords are held by Fools,</L>
<L>And are afraid to use their own&punc; Edge-Tools.</L>
<L>Since the <HI>Plain-Dealers</HI> Scenes of Manly Rage,</L>
<L>Not one has dar'd to lash this Crying Age.</L>
<L>This time, the Poet owns the bold Essay,</L>
<L>Yet hopes there's no ill-manners in his Play:</L>
<L>And he declares by me, he has design'd</L>
<L>Affront to none, but frankly speaks his mind.</L>
<L>And shou'd the ensuing Scenes not chance to hit,</L>
<L>He offers but this one Excuse, 'twas writ</L>
<L>Before your late Encouragement of Wit.</L>

<PB REF="8">
<HEAD>EPILOGUE</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Spoken at the opening of the New House, By Mrs. <HI>Bracegirdle.</HI></HEAD>
<L>SURE Providence at first, design'd this Place</L>
<L>To be the Player's Refuge in distress;</L>
<L>For still in every Storm, they all run hither,</L>
<L>As to a Shed, that shields 'em from the Weather.</L>
<L>But thinking of this change which last befel us,</L>
<L>It's like what I have heard our Poets tell us:</L>
<L>For when behind our Scenes their Suits are pleading,</L>
<L>To help their Love, sometimes they show their Reading;</L>
<L>And wanting ready Cash to pay for Hearts,</L>
<L>They top their Learning on us, and their Parts.</L>
<L>Once of Philosophers they told us Stories,</L>
<L>Whom, as I think they call'd&mdash;<HI>Py</HI>&mdash;<HI>Pythagories,</HI></L>
<L>I'm sure 'tis some such <HI>Latin</HI> Name they give 'em,</L>
<L>And we, who know no better, must believe 'em.</L>
<L>Now to these Men (say they) such Souls were given,</L>
<L>That after Death, ne're went to Hell, nor Heaven,</L>
<L>But liv'd, I know not how, in Beasts; and then</L>
<L>When many Years were past, in Men again.</L>
<L>Methinks, we <HI>Players</HI> resemble such a Soul,</L>
<L>That, does from Bodies, we from Houses strole.</L>
<L>Thus <HI>Aristotle's</HI> Soul, of old that was,</L>
<L>May now be damn'd to animate an Ass;</L>
<L><PB REF="8">Or in this very House, for ought we know,</L>
<L>Is doing painful Penance in some <HI>Beau,</HI></L>
<L>And this our Audience, which did once resort</L>
<L>To shining Theatres to see our Sport,</L>
<L>Now find us toss'd into a Tennis-Court.</L>
<L>These Walls but t&punc;other Day were fill'd with Noise</L>
<L>Of Roaring Gamesters, and your <HI>Damme Boys.</HI></L>
<L>Then bounding Balls and Rackets they encompass'd,</L>
<L>And now they're fill'd with Iests, and Flights, and Bombast!</L>
<L>I vow, I don't much like this Transmigration,</L>
<L>Stroling from Place to Place, by Circulation.</L>
<L>Grant Heaven, we don't return to our first Station.</L>
<L>I know not what these think, but for my Part,</L>
<L>I can't reflect without an aking Heart,</L>
<L>How we shou'd end in our Original, a Cart.</L>
<L>But we can't fear, since you're so good to save us,</L>
<L>That you have only set us up, to leave us.</L>
<L>Thus from the past, we hope for future Grace,</L>
<L>I beg it&mdash;</L>
<L>And some here know I have a begging Face.</L>
<L>Then pray continue this your kind behaviour,</L>
<L>For a clear Stage won't do, without your Favour.</L>

<P>Sir, you're a Gentleman, and probably understand this fine Feeding: But if you please, I had rather be at Board-Wages. Does your <HI>Epictetus,</HI> or your <HI>Seneca</HI> here, or any of these poor, rich Rogues, teach you how to pay your Debts without Money? Will they shut up the Mouths of your Creditors? Will <HI>Plato</HI> be Bail for you? Or <HI>Diogenes,</HI> because he understands Confinement,
<PB N="2" REF="10">
and liv'd in a Tub, go to Prison for you? 'Slife, Sir, what do you mean, to mew your self up here with Three or Four musty Books, in commendation of Starving and Poverty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sirrah, I have no Money, you know it; and there|fore resolve to rail at all that have: And in that I but follow the Examples of the wisest and wittiest Men in all Ages; these Poets and Philosophers whom you naturally hate, for just such another Reason; because they abound in Sense, and you are a Fool.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Iere.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, Sir, I am a Fool, I know it: And yet, Heav'n help me, I'm poor enough to be a Wit&mdash;But I was always a Fool, when I told you what your Expences would bring you to; your Coaches and your Liveries; your Treats and your Balls; your be|ing in Love with a Lady, that did not care a Farthing for you in your Prosperity; and keeping Company with Wits, that car'd for nothing but your Prosperity; and now when you are poor, hate you as much as they do one another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; and now I am poor, I have an opportunity to be reveng'd on 'em all; I'll pursue <HI>Angelica</HI> with more Love than ever, and appear more notoriously her Admirer in this Restraint, than when I openly rival'd the rich Fops, that made Court to her; so shall my Poverty be a Mortification to her Pride, and perhaps, make her compassionate that Love, which has principally reduc'd me to this Lowness of Fortune. And for the Wits, I'm sure I'm in a Condition to be even with them&mdash;</P>

<P>Nay, your Condition is pretty even with theirs, that's the truth on't.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="10">
<SPEAKER>Iere.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, it's impossible&mdash;I may die with you, starve with you, or be dam'd with your Works: But to live even Three days, the Life of a Play, I no more expect it, than to be Canoniz'd for a Muse after my Decease.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are witty, you Rogue, I shall want your Help;&mdash;I'll have you learn to make Couplets, to tag the ends of Acts: d'ye hear, get the Maids to Crambo in an Evening, and learn the knack of Rhiming; you may arrive at the height of a Song, sent by an unknown Hand, or a Chocolate-House Lampoon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Iere.</SPEAKER>
<P>But Sir, Is this the way to recover your Father's Favour? Why Sir <HI>Sampson</HI> will be irreconcilable. If your Younger Brother shou'd come from Sea, he'd never look upon you again. You're undone, Sir; you're ruin'd; you won't have a Friend left in the World, if you turn Poet&mdash;Ah Pox confound that <HI>Will</HI>'s Coffee-House, it has ruin'd more Young Men than the <HI>Royal-Oak</HI> Lot|tery&mdash;Nothing thrives that belongs to't.

<P>You are the most mistaken in the World; there is no Creature perfectly Civil, but a Husband. For in a little time he grows only rude to his Wife, and that is the highest good Breed|ing, for it begets his Civility to other People. Well, I'll tell you News; but I suppose you hear your Brother <HI>Benjamin</HI> is landed.

<P>Nay, You say true in that, it's but a folly to lie: For to speak one thing, and to think just the contrary way; is as it were,

to look one way, and to row another.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I'm sure it is not so, for I'll speak sooner than you should believe that; and I'll speak truth, tho' one should always tell a lie to a man; and I don't care, let my Father do what he will; I'm too big to be whipt, so I'll tell you plainly, I don't like you, nor love you at all, nor never will, that's more: So, there's your answer for you; and don't trouble me no more, you ugly thing.</P>

<P>Look you Young Woman, You may learn to give good words however. I spoke you fair d'ee see, and civil.&mdash;As for your Love or your liking, I don't value it of a Rope's end;&mdash;And may-hap I like you as little as you do me:&mdash;What I said was in Obedience to Father; Gad I fear a Whipping no more than you do. But I tell you one thing, if you shou'd give such Language at Sea, you'd have a Cat o' Nine-tails laid cross your Shoulders. Flesh who are you?

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>What sad Effects?&mdash;What's too late? my seeming Mad|ness has deceiv'd my Father, and procur'd me time to think of

means to reconcile me to him; and preserve the right of my In|heritance to his Estate; which otherwise by Articles, I must this Morning have resign'd: And this I had inform'd you of to Day, but you were gone, before I knew you had been here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! I thought your love of me had caus'd this Trans|port in your Soul; which, it seems, you only counterfeited; for by, mercinary Ends and sordid Interest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, now you do me Wrong; for if any Interest was considered, it was yours; since I thought I wanted more than Love, to make me worthy of you.</P>

<P>I did not think you had Apprehension enough to be ex|ceptious: But Madmen shew themselves most, by over preten|ding to a sound Understanding; as Drunken men do by over acting Sobriety; I was half inclining to believe you, till I acci|dentally touch'd upon your tender Part: But now you have restor'd me to my former Opinion and Compassion.</P>

<P>You are not leaving me in this Uncertainty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wou'd any thing, but a Madman complain of Uncer|tainty? Uncertainty and Expectation are the Joys of Life. Se|curity is an insipid thing, and the overtaking and possessing of a Wish, discovers the Folly of the Chase. Never let us know one another better; for the Pleasure of a Masquerade is done, when we come to shew Faces; But I'll tell you two things be|fore I leave you; I am not the Fool you take me for; and you are Mad and don't know it.</P>

<P>they say so of a Witches Pray'r, and Dreams and <HI>Dutch</HI> Almanacks are to be understood by contraries.

<P>You're an absolute Courtier, Sir <HI>Sampson.</HI></P>

<P>Not at all, Madam: Odsbud you wrong me; I am not so old neither, to be a bare Courtier, only a Man of Words. Odd, I have warm Blood about me yet, I can serve a Lady any way&mdash;Come, come, let me tell you, you Women think a Man old too soon, faith and troth you do&mdash;Come, don't despise Fifty; odd Fifty, in a hale Constitution, is no such contemptible Age.</P>

<P>Fifty a contemptible Age! Not at all, a very fashion|able Age I think&mdash;I assure you I know very considerable

<P>O Pox, outsides, outsides; a pize take 'em, meer outsides. Hang your side-Box Beaus; no, I'm none of those, none of your forc'd Trees, that pretend to Blossom in the Fall; and Bud when they should bring forth Fruit. I am of a long liv'd Race, and inherit Vigour, none of my Family married till Fif|ty; yet they begot Sons and Daughters till Fourscore. I am of your Patriarchs, I, a Branch of one of your <HI>Antideluvian</HI> Families, Fellows, that the Flood could not wash away. Well, Madam, what are your Commands? Has any young Rogue affronted you, and shall I cut his Throat? or&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir&punc; <HI>Sampson,</HI> I have no Quarrel upon my Hands&mdash;I have more Occasion for your Conduct than your Courage at this time. To tell you the Truth, I'm weary of living single, and want a Husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Samp.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Odsbud, and 'tis pity you should&mdash;Odd, wou'd she wou'd like me, then I shou'd hamper my young Rogues: Odd, wou'd she wou'd; faith and troth she's devilish Handsom.</P>
<STAGE>Aside.</STAGE>
<P>Madam, you deserve a good Husband, and 'twere pity you shou'd be thrown away upon any of these young idle Rogues about the Town. Odd, there's ne're a young Fellow worth hang|ing&mdash;that is a very young Fellow&mdash;Pize on 'em, they never think beforehand of any thing;&mdash;And if they commit Matrimony, 'tis as they commit Murder; out of a Frolick: And are ready to hang themselves, or to be hang'd by the Law, the next Morning.&mdash;Odso, have a care, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Therefore I ask your Advice, Sir <HI>Sampson:</HI> I have For|tune enough to make any Man easie that I can like; If there were such a thing as a young agreeable Man, with a reasonable Stock of good Nature and Sense&mdash;For I would neither have an absolute Wit, nor a Fool.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Samp.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Odd, you are hard to please, Madam; to find a young Fellow that is neither a Wit in his own Eye, nor a Fool in the Eye of the World, is a very hard Task. But, faith and troth you speak very discreetly; For I hate both a Wit and a Fool.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Angl.</SPEAKER>
<P>She that marries a Fool, Sir <HI>Sampson,</HI> commits the Re|putation of her Honesty or Understanding to the Censure of the
<PB N="78" REF="48">
World: And she that marries a very Witty Man, submits both to the Severity and insolent Conduct of her Husband. I should like a Man of Wit for a Lover, because I would have such an one in my Power; but I would no more be his Wife, than his Enemy. For his Malice is not a more terrible Consequence of his Aversion, than his Jealousie is of his Love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Samp.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>None of old <HI>Foresight's Sybills</HI> ever utter'd such a Truth. Odsbud, you have wone my Heart: I hate a Wit; I had a Son that was spoil'd among 'em; a good hopeful Lad, till he learn'd to be a Wit&mdash;And might have risen in the State&mdash;But, a pox on't, his Wit run him out of his Money, and now his Poverty has run him out of his Wits.</P>

<P>Sir <HI>Sampson,</HI> as your Friend, I must tell you, you are ve|ry much abus'd in that Matter; He's no more Mad than you are.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Samp.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How, Madam! Wou'd I cou'd prove it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can tell you how that may be done&mdash;But it is a thing that wou'd make me appear to be too much concern'd in your Affairs.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Samp.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Odsbud I believe she likes me.&mdash;</P>
<STAGE>Aside.</STAGE>
<P>&mdash;Ah, Madam, all my Affairs are scarce worthy to be laid at your Feet; And I wish, Madam, they stood in a better Posture, that I might make a more becoming Offer to a Lady of your incom|parable Beauty and Merit.&mdash;If I had <HI>Peru</HI> in one Hand, and <HI>Mexico</HI> in t'other, and the <HI>Eastern</HI> Empire under my Feet; it would make me only a more glorious Victim to be offer'd at the Shrine of your Beauty.</P>

<P>Hold, hold, Sir <HI>Sampson.</HI> I ask'd your Advice for a Hus|band, and you are giving me your Consent&mdash;I was indeed thinking to propose something like it in a Jest, to satisfie you about <HI>Valentine:</HI> For if a Match were seemingly carried on, be|tween you and me, it would oblige him to throw off his Dis|guise of Madness, in Apprehension of losing me: For you know he has long pretended a Passion for me.</P>

<P>You're an illiterate Fool, and I'm another, and the Stars are Lyars; and if I had Breath enough, I'd curse them and you, my self and every Body&mdash;Oons, Cully'd, Bubbl'd, Jilted Woman-bobb'd at last&mdash;I have not Patience.</P>

<P>Sir, I ask you Ten Thousand Pardons, 'twas an errant mistake&mdash;You see, Sir, my Master was never mad, nor any thing like it&mdash;Then how could it be otherwise?</P>

<P><HI>Tattle,</HI> I thank you, you would have interposed between me and Heav'n; but Providence laid Purgatory in your way&mdash;You have but Justice.</P>

<P>I hear the Fiddles that Sir <HI>Sampson</HI> provided for his own Wedding; methinks 'tis pity they should not be employ'd when the Match is so much mended. <HI>Valentine,</HI> tho' it be Morning, we may have a Dance.</P>

<P>I have done dissembling now, <HI>Valentine;</HI> and if that Coldness which I have always worn before you, should turn to an extream Fondness, you must not suspect it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll prevent that suspicion&mdash;For I intend to doat on at that immoderate rate, that your Fondness shall never distin|guish it self enough, to be taken notice of. If ever you seem to love too much, it must be only when I can't love enough.</P>

<P>Well, Madam, You have done Exemplary Justice, in pu|nishing an inhumane Father, and rewarding a Faithful Lover: But there is a Third good Work, which I, in particular, must thank you for; I was an Infidel to your Sex; and you have converted me&mdash;For now I am convinc'd that all Women are not like Fortune, blind in bestowing Favours, either on those who do not merit, or who do not want 'em.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis an unreasonable Accusation, that you lay upon our Sex: You tax us with Injustice, only to cover your own want of Merit. You would all have the Reward of Love; but few have the Constancy to stay till it becomes your due. Men are

generally. Hypocrites and Infidels, they pretend to Worship, but have neither Zeal nor Faith: How few, like <HI>Valentine,</HI> would persevere even unto Martyrdom, and sacrifice their Interest to their Constancy! In admiring me, you misplace the Novelty.
<Q><L>The Miracle to Day is, that we find</L>
<L>A Lover true: Not that a Woman's Kind.</L></Q></P>
