<P>_PArdon me Right Honourable, if amongst your other more se|rious present affaires, I presume to dedicate to your acceptance and perusall this short discourse of forraigne Traffike: It hath ever beene ac|counted a branch of <HI>Englands</HI> Royall Stem, and a commoditie, that for many yeeres, hath brought a wonderfull Revenue to <HI>Englands</HI> Diadem; It now presseth to your presence as an agrieved weight, laden with many set|ters, imposed thereon by the covetousnesse of some, and by the Envyers of our prosperous Traffike, yet seeing that like religious Pilots you guide the helme of our Kingdome with

and come thereby,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The same found of no effect, where the contrary is allowed.</NOTE> yet it must likewise bee considered, as a thing granted and found true by experience, that in some countries and free Townes, where the ex|portation thereof is freely allowed and admitted, and the carrying out openly permitted by authority; no such want or scarcity is discerned; but contrari|wise, all abundance and plenty thereof is noted, so that this being granted, the exportation thereof may bee allowed without prejudice to the state or King|dome where we abide: now forasmuch as that this point will hardly find ad|mittance in the opinion of many of our Sage Politicians, I wil a little enlarge my selfe thereupon, endeavouring by foraign example to make good this my asser|tion.</P>
<P>There is two differing countries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An example of both for proofe.</NOTE> the one a great Kingdome, where gold and Silver in the greatest plenty groweth, and the prohibition of exportation ther|of, strictly observed &amp; most looked into, and the other a petty Dukedome, whose

<P>And that not onely in com|mon casualties, mishaps, and

dangers, but somesomes to wra|stle and stand even against the foure Elements, combined toge|ther, to threaten their ruine, and destruction, which is the stron|gest and most remarkable evi|dence and proofe, that possibly can bee alledged or spoken, of the constant and firme resolution of a man.</P>
<P>This sole point and considerati|on, hath beene the occasion, that some States have beene of opini|on, and thought that this doore should be opened, to the adventu|ring Merchant to attaine unto No|bility, so as the Father and the Sonne, have continued succesfully for some ages therein; and which is seene in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ome sort to be practi|sed in some places at this day, and if those Noble-men, (the up|holders of a Land or Kingdome)
<PB N="56" REF="33">
who are commonly the riche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t and greatest in an estate, should practise and addict themselves to this Commerce, and Sea-Traf|fike (as some beganne to doe in Queene ELIZABETHS daies) being a thing not prejudiciall, nor hurtfull to their honour, or to their noble condition, doubt|lesse it is, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d would bee more honourable unto them, then to bee Vsuerers, and Bankers, as is observed in <HI>Italy,</HI> and many other Countries as they are, or to impove|rish themselves, in doing of no|thing, or nought worthie of note, but neglect their owne occasi|ons, in spending, lavishing, and wasting, when peradventure they never gather any thing to what they have, or what was formerly was left unto them, by their An|cestours.
<PB N="49" REF="33">
Hence would grow many advanta|ges,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The benefit of the Trade of Nobles and rich in a kingdome.</NOTE> both to the publike and private, for that they that thus deale in traffike, having thus meanes, courage, and suffi|ciencie, for this Conduct and Enterprise, the same would bee farre greater, and more eminent in it selfe, then now it is, setting thus more ships to sea, and by be+ing consequently better armed, and bet|ter furnished; and whereof the state in time of need, might make good use of, for its safety and defence; and withall it would carry the reputation of that Nation, farre further into remote Regi|ons; the which they cannot doe, who being poore, and having lit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le or no stock, but of one ages gathering, or per|adventure taken up at Interest, and bor|rowed from others, wanting both power, meanes, and courage, either to hazard themselves in great, and eminent Enterprises, or to wade through the same, being once entred thereinto.</P>
<P>And for other particular Interest, this Commerce being wisely managed, and
<PB N="50" REF="34">
discreetly handled, what hazard soever they should run, there is more to be got|ten thereby, then to be lost: And if Gen|tlemen in generall would thus apply themselves to traffike, as some within these late yeares have beene observed to doe, and that without wasting of their estates by vast Expences, or importu|ning their Soveraigne by disorderly de|mands and gifts, they should by all like|lihoods benefit themselves more in one yeare, by a well govern'd traffick at sea, then peradventure at Court by ten years waiting and solicitations.</P>
<P>Finally, to conclude this point, Ex|perience hath taught, and teacheth us daily, where those of great purses, and good judgements have exercised traf|ficke, and where such have beene bac|ked and encouraged by a gracious, and furthering Soveraigne, and by a Prince that loveth Navigation, and favoureth Traffick; it hath mightily enriched both themselves, and the Princes and Estates, under which they have liv'd; as by the

<P>Fifteenth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">15.

<PB N="52" REF="35">
succeeds happily; yet it is to be conside|red, that the losse which may happen, would wholly ruine him that attempts the danger alone; and if in making a joynt Company, or Society, the Gaine should turne to be the lesse; y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t it is ever more assured, and the disorders by Traf|fike by a good government is still remo|ved; and the losse being borne by ma|ny, it is consequently the lesse to every one that is interessed therein; and thus dividing the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rade of the whole, ac|cording to either the places, or coasts where the same is made, forbidding them to attempt one upon anothers pri|viledges; and prohibiting all other pri|vate Subjects (of what quality soever) which shal not be Members or free Bro|thers of those Societies, to negotiate in|to those parts upon great penalties, and appointing certaine Governours, or o|thers the greatest adventurers, to order and regulate the said Traffike and Com|panies; which Rules have found such good successe, both in <HI>Holland, England,</HI>
<PB N="53" REF="35">
and else-where, that it hath beene one of the maine causes, that hath brought the traffike of <HI>London,</HI> and of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> to that present height and greatnesse, as it is now observed to be.<NOTE PLACE="marg">16. To lend money to the Merchant out of the common Treasury.</NOTE></P>
<P>Next for the furtherance of the Traf|fike of some Kingdomes, it hath beene observed, that great summes of monies have beene lent <HI>gratis,</HI> or upon easie rates and security, to skilfull Merchants, out of the soveraigne, or common Trea|surie, which hath also found such good successe, as that the customes of that Prince have beene thereby much increa|sed, the kingdome enriched, the poore set on worke, and the native Commo|dities thereof, vented to all parts of the world thereby.<NOTE PLACE="marg">17.

<P>In the next place, it hath beene noted mainely to further the traffike of a Kingdome, the transportation of bils of debt, from one man to another, in liew of monies, as is used in some Countries; for thereby many Law suits are avoyded amongst Dealers,
<PB N="54" REF="36">
errors in Merchants accounts cleared, the Princes customes increased, the great stock of the Kingdome, which conti|nually lyeth in all Negotiators hands in dead Bills and Bonds, employed, Traf|fike it selfe quickned, and such a benefit enjoyed thereby to the Common|wealth, as cannot be expressed.</P>
<P>In the next place it hath beene obser|ved in some places,<NOTE PLACE="marg">18. Exam|ple of the Princ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, a maine Fur|therer of Trade.</NOTE> where the poore for want of abilities cannot trade, and where the great or rich have not will, or dare not adventure their Estates in for|raine Traffike, that the examples onely of the Prince hath throughly effected it, and proved a mai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Furtherer of the ge|nerall Commerce and Traffike of his Countrey; which doth not only hold in this matter of Trade, but in all other state matters whatsoever; for then it will be impossible for the rich Subjects to for|beare; when they see their Soveraigne bend his mind, and addict himselfe ther|unto. For the wise have observed, that Princes cannot frame an Age unlike
<PB N="55" REF="36">
unto themselves;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cassiod.</HI> 11.3.</NOTE> and that it is easier (as one said) for Nature to erre, then that a Prince should form a Common-wealth unlike himselfe: Iust if they be wicked, regular if they be dissolute, chaste if they be immodest, and religious if they bee impious.</P>
<P>Neither is it thus in these our dayes; History it selfe warrants the point, and makes it good in all former ages. For, under <HI>Romulus</HI> it was found that <HI>Rome</HI> was warlike; but under their Soverain <HI>Numa</HI> they were religious, under the <HI>Fabritii</HI> they were continent, under the <HI>Catoes Regular,</HI> under the <HI>Graccbi</HI> seditious, under the <HI>Lucalli</HI> and <HI>Antonines,</HI> intemperate and dissolute; under <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great the Empire is Christian, but under <HI>Iulian</HI> idolatrous: Therefore, for conclusion, if the Prince love the sea, his Subjects will be all Sea-men; and if he be a Lo|ver of trade and traffike, the rich and powerfull of his Kingdomes, will be all Merchants.</P>

which are both many and usefull, will againe be transported from the said sta|ple, to those Southerne and Westerne Countries, and hereby the Merchants would mightily flourish by this inlarge|ment of trade.</P>
<P>Secondly, diverse sea-Townes, where this staple should be kept would be very much enriched.</P>
<P>Thirdly, the Mariners and shipping of this Kingdome, would hereby come to be very much enlarged and im|ployed.</P>
<P>Fourthly, many poore people, and other handy crafts men and labourers, would be hereby set on worke, and im|ployed.</P>
<P>Fifthly, the honour and reputation of this Kingdome will be much advanced in other countries, and much Bullion would thereby come to be imported.</P>

<P>To conclude this point, having thus shewed the courses that are used in sundry Countries, for the setling, preserving, and augmenta|tion of Commerce in generall, and withall considered how farre in his owne person a Merchant is able to benefit, and advance his Countrey and place of his aboade, and how a staple of

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">English East-India trade.</NOTE> Here I could also particularize, the fet|ters Incroachments, and Intrusions that have within these late yeares beene laid upon the <HI>East-India</HI> traders of <HI>England,</HI> and their liberties, and what they have suffe|red both abroad and at home, by the ill wishers of their prosperity; but what will it availe them, or benefit our coun|trey, to travell into the disturbations, crosses and afflictions, which they have, to their prejudice, felt, and to their losse suffered? It sufficeth me here to say, that the want of due and timely protection, and incouragement from the Estate, hath reduced them to that bad point, and low passe, wherein we now observe them to bee; and that for the future erecting of such a brave society, a great deale of time, and mony must be expended, and many larger immunities then formerly must be granted, ere the same can be reduced to
<PB N="89" REF="55">
that pristine flourishing estate we lately have beheld it to be in.</P>
<P>I could also here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Turke, and Moscovia Company in
<HI>England.</HI></NOTE> by way of addition, say somewhat of those disturbances, that the <HI>Turky, Moscovia,</HI> and other Compa|nies of <HI>London</HI> have groaned under; but I trust the goodnesse of our Soveraigne, and the wisdome of his Counsellors, will rectifie the same, or remunerate them by fitting encouragements some other wayes; lest thereby the same be re|duced to the present condition of the
<HI>East-India</HI> Company, to His Majesties great losse and dishonour, and to the wonderfull prejudice of his people and kingdomes.</P>
<P>Now, having thus handled the 3. first considerations of trade, &amp; observed that neither naturall nor artificiall commodi|ties of a kingdom can inrich a countrey without the helpe and hand of traffike; and then shewed what commodities by a well ordered traffike, a Kingdome must suffer entrance, and what prohibit, and what againe to send out, and also what
<PB N="90" REF="56">
to forbid, and withall shewed the par|ticular meanes and wayes that Princes are observed to use to gaine, settle, pre|serve, and augment the same with the la|borious and studious courses that have beene taken by sundry late Princes to ob|taine and purchase this so beneficiall a commodity: I come now to the last point and consideration before mentio|ned, wherein the rest is for the most part comprehended,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The reasons that doe move Prin|ces to covet trade in their Kingdomes.</NOTE> being the reasons and causes that move all estates, Kings and Empires to covet the same, which I may say doth extend it selfe into foure heads and principall parts.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Honoura|ble.</NOTE> The first is, that traffike with foraine nations is notable in respect of the ho|nour and reputation thereof.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Rich.</NOTE> Secondly, excellent in point of riches, both to the King, his Countrey, and Sub|jects.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">3 Strong.</NOTE> Thirdly, eminent in regard of strength offensive, and defensive, that it brings
<PB N="91" REF="56">
with it to the Countrey and Princes where it is orderly managed; and regu|larly practised by skilfull Merchants.</P>
<P>First then,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ttraffike is honourable to the people and country.</NOTE> a well governed traffike, practised in a Kingdome, by judicious and expert Merchants, to foraine and re|mote countries will easily bee granted, and confessed to bee both honourable, and of singular reputation, both to the Soveraigne in his particular, and to the nation in generall. I need not seeke farre for examples, nor search much for ar|guments to make this good and mani|fest, but only looke upon this our king|dome wherein wee live. How had ever the name of the English beene knowne in <HI>India,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Experienced in the Eng|lish.</NOTE> <HI>Persia, Moscovia,</HI> or in
<HI>Turky,</HI> and in many places else-where, had not the traffike of our Nation dis|covered and spread abroad the fame of their Soveraigne Potency, and the re|nowne of that peoples valour and worth? Many parts of the world had, peradventure even to this day, lived
<PB N="92" REF="57">
in ignorance thereof, and never dreamt of the inhabitants of so small an Iland, had not the traffike of the Merchants by Navigation made it famous over all those remote Regions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">And in the Portugall and Hollan|der.</NOTE> Nay, the <HI>Portugals,</HI> and <HI>Hollanders,</HI> an ob|scure people, in comparison of the Eng|lish, and enjoying but a handfull of those subjects, that are comprehended under the Scepter of great <HI>Britaine,</HI> have by this onely meanes given witnesse and good testimony, to many powerfull remote nations, of their countries worth and honour.</P>
<P>What brought the <HI>Portugall</HI> nation to to be famoused in <HI>Affrica</HI> and <HI>Asia,</HI> or the
<HI>Spanish</HI> name to bee notable in <HI>America,</HI> but her traffike and Commerce.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The com|merce, and not the con|quests of the English have made them famous in
<HI>India.</HI></NOTE> It is not our conquests, but our Com|merce; it is not our swords, but our sayls, that first spred the English name in <HI>Bar|bary,</HI> and thence came into <HI>Turky, Armenia, Moscovia, Arabia, Persia, India, China,</HI> and in|deed over and about the world; it is the traffike of their Merchants, and the
<PB N="93" REF="57">
boundlesse desires of that nation to eter|nize the English honour and name, that hath enduced them to saile, and seek into all the corners of the earth. What part is there unsearched, what place undis|covered, or what place lyes unattemp|ted by their endeavours, and couragious undertakings? most of which hath beene accompanied with such fortunate suc|cesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">League con|tracted by the English Merchants with foraine Princes.</NOTE> that they have contracted Leagues and Amity with the Mogull, Persian, Turke, Moscovite, and other mighty fo|raine Princes in their Soveraignes name, and to his honour; which even in our Fathers dayes was not knowne to us, ei|ther to have any such condition, or being the Merchants of <HI>England.</HI> And to speak truth of <HI>London,</HI> maintaining now at their charge an Agent in <HI>Moscovia,</HI> an Ambassa|dour and three Consuls in <HI>Turky,</HI> and cer|taine Presidents and Agents also in <HI>India, Persia,</HI> and many other places thereof, which by computation cannot cost them lesse then one hundred thousand pounds yearely (which though it may<NOTE PLACE="marg">At their own charge 100000. l. yearely.</NOTE>
<PB N="94" REF="58">
be alledged is for their own profit, &amp; the benefit of their traffike into these parts) yet for as much as that it is not charge|able to their Soveraigne, nor prejudiciall, but profitable to his Kingdomes, it must be granted that the same brings honour to his name, and a great benefit both to him and his subjects; and it is more then can be paralleld in all other Christian or heathen Countries now in the world.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Danes, Sweeds and Germans not knowne in <HI>India,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> The Danes and Swedish nations are potent, and the French are yet more powerfull in Europe; yet if you travell into <HI>India, Persia,</HI> and many of those Easterne Kingdomes of the world, they know of no such people, Kings or Coun|tries, but hold all Europe to be inhabited by the Portugals, English and Dutch; nay the French are hardly knowne in
<HI>Moscovia</HI> and <HI>Russia,</HI> save by name, but not by their worth or actions; and the Em|perour of <HI>Germany,</HI> the greatest of our Christian Princes, for all his eminence and power in Christendome, is not in
<HI>India,</HI> knowne, no nor yet in <HI>Persia,</HI> save
<PB N="95" REF="58">
for some leagues, which the Sophy would sometimes have contracted with him, to the prejudice of <HI>Turky,</HI> and the Ottoman Empire.</P>
<P>So that by what hath beene said, the Commerce of Merchants, though many times it be accompanied with losse and prejudice to themselves, and estates, and that they are enforced to expose their fortunes to the mercy of mercilesse stormes and tempests, &amp; be subject to the Lawes of Heathenish Princes, and groan under the heavy customes of many So|veraignes and Infidels; yet is it still at|tended upon with a great deale of ho|nour to their owne Prince, and reputa|tion to his subjects: Therefore I will conclude here this point, that a well or|dered traffike managed by skilfull Mer|chants, hath beene, and ever will be, ho|nourable to that Kingdome and Sove|raigne, where the same is duely practi|sed, and carefully protected, and preser|ved.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Traffike is excellent in point of Riches, tw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> wayes.</NOTE></P>
<P>The second point is in regard of
<PB N="96" REF="59">
Riches, and the benefit that traffike bringeth with it, where the same is pre|served with fitting priviledges, and pra|ctised with regular order and method; and this Riches extendeth it selfe two wayes.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 To the King and his Nobles.</NOTE> In the first place to the Soveraigne, his Nobles and Gentry, in the particular of their owne estates and Interests.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 To his people.</NOTE> Secondly to his subjects, the inhabi|tants in generall; As to the Sea-men, Husbandmen, Artificers, Labourers, and others.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How it in|richeth the King.</NOTE> First for the Prince, or Soveraigne, it particularly inricheth him by his cu|stomes and imposts, imposed inwards, and outwards upon all commodities and wares, either imported or exported, in or out of his Kingdomes and Domi|nions, by the Merchant, and also by ven|ting, and dispersing of such wares, and merchandises, as hee appropriateth to himselfe, either by purchase, preroga|tive, or by right of his Crowne; as we find it to doe by the Gabell of Bay-salt,
<PB N="97" REF="59">
to the King of <HI>France,</HI> by the property of silke to the King of <HI>Persia,</HI> by the Mines of Copper to the grand Signior, and by the preemtion of Tyn to His Maje|stie of <HI>England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Nobility.</NOTE> and next it proveth bene|ficiall to the Nobility and Gentry, by the improvement of their lands, by the sale and working of their clothes, by the use of their Timber, by the vent of their Cattle, Graine, and other provisions, and in many regards, which experience dai|ly maketh evident, both in this, and all other Kingdoms where the same is pra|ctised.</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the countrey.</NOTE> it inricheth the inhabitants of a countrey in the generall, by setting Arts-men on worke, by imploying the poore, by furthering and incouraging of all professions whatsoever; for every Arts-man, Worke-man and Artificer, is conducible one way or other to traffike, and every hand is set on worke, where a wel governed Commerce is observed to be driven, and exercised by judicious and skilfull Merchants, and to the whole
<PB N="98" REF="60">
countrey in generall it is found benefi|ciall by venting the native commodities of that land, as experience tels us, in <HI>Per|sia</HI> by the vent of their raw silkes, in
<HI>France</HI> by the vent of their Wines, Oyles, Lynens, Graine, &amp;c. in <HI>Zante</HI> by the vent of their Corrence, in <HI>Spaine</HI> by the vent of their Wines, Fruits, Sugars, &amp;c. and in <HI>England</HI> by the vent of their Tinne, Cloath, Lead, &amp;c. as the like may be said of many other countries.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">3. Traffike produceth strength two wayes.</NOTE> Thirdly and lastly, it produceth strength and safety to the Kingdom and people, where the same is duly and or|derly practised.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">That which begets wealth, also doth beget strength.</NOTE> Now this strength and safety may be considered two wayes; either defensive or offensive: if my former assertions be granted, That a well ordered trade doth enrich a Prince, his nobles, gentiles and Subjects, as of necessity it must, it will be easie for mee to make good this point also; for that which produceth Riches, doth consequently also beget strength and safety, so farre forth as trea|sure
<PB N="99" REF="60">
is accounted the principal nerve and sinnew of war, either offensive, or defen|sive; but to come to some particulars</P>
<P>It furnisheth the Prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How traffike doth beget strength.</NOTE> and his sub|jects, having maritime ports, with plen|ty of shipping, and store of Mariners, to manage and sayle the same, in all oc|casions of the state and countrey by sea&punc; and it furnisheth the same with all fitting Ammunition of and for warre, as Powder, Armes, and other the like necessaries; and by land it maketh the countrey a Magazine, not only for war|like provisions, brought in for the use of the Prince, and the Kingdom it selfe, but also for all other neighbouring countries that stand in need thereof.</P>
<P>I may here fitly bring in <HI>Holland</HI> to make good this point to all the world,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An excellent plo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the Hollanders to inr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch themselves.</NOTE> who, though exercised in continuall warfare, and daily pressed, and some|times oppressed by a potent Enemy; yet their industrious traffike into Forrain parts, is handled and practised with so much benefit, countenanced from
<PB N="100" REF="61">
the State and good Iudgement, that the same doth not onely supply their owne occasions, with what warlike provisions they want, but withall have thereof in such abundance, that from their owne states they furnish freely all other neigh|bouring countries whatsoever there|with; for the Arts-men that are by them employed daily, in building of ships, ca|sting of Artillery, making of Muskets, shot, powder, swords, pikes, corslets, cor|dage, Canvas, and the like Habiliments of warre, doe not only supply their owne turnes, and necessities, and that both cheape and plentifull; but herein pro|ceed so farre, contrary to the politike Rules of many countries, that they sell, and vent their over-plus; yea even to the Spaniards their very enemies conceiving it, no ill trick of thrift, nor yet small point of State-stratagem, to draw thus the monies and wealth of their greatest ad|versaries to be a reward to their owne labour and industry, and so sell as it may be said (for monies to their foes) the
<PB N="101" REF="61">
very sword, which peradventure may aftewards be imployed in the cutting of their owne throats, but being instru|ments considerable, and which must necessarily be had in warre, and which will be by their enemies had else-where for monies, if not of them, they chuse rather thus to sell them, and so by per|mitting an unusuall policy of state, en|deavour for their monies to give them with their owne consents, and that vo|luntarily, and of their owne accord, what they cannot with their best of policie otherwise prevent, and what their enemies will bee furnished with|all, in despight of their utmost endea|vours else-where.</P>
<P>I need not insist further upon this point, having declared the honour, be|nefit, and strength, both offensive and defensive, which doth arise to a Com|mon-wealth or Countrey by a well or|dered traffike, managed by Regular and Iudicious Merchants, I could here adde to what I have said before in the behalfe
<PB N="102" REF="62">
of the Merchant, and shew that as hee can in many things advance his coun|trey before a meere States-man, so also declare the Nobility of his art, and the excellency of his profession, no one vocation in the world requiring a more generall knowledge, and inspection into all other professions then this doth; and withall make it appeare, that hee is the best of Common-wealths men, both towards his Prince, and fellow-sub|jects; and that for the most part all other professions live, and have their subsi|stence from others, hee onely giving by traffike a lively-hood to others, and no way dependent, but upon himselfe, and his owne labour and endeavours; as it will easily appeare to any judicious man that shall examine his profession, and compare the same with others.</P>
<P>But I will conclude this discourse, and take it by what hath beene said for granted, as for a truth undeniable, That the excellency of a well ordered traf|fike, is such and so singular, and the
<PB N="95" REF="62">
effects thereof so notably beneficiall to a kingdome, and in its selfe so admira|ble, and the discreet and skilfull Mer|chants endeavours so laudable, and his art so eminently honorable, that it re|quireth and duly challengeth</P>
