<SPEAKER>Dick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes that I have by a good token, I
once walking in Cheap-side to buy three yards
of blacke pudding, the Bell made such a hum|ming
in my yeares, as if a thousand Tinkers
had beene at worke there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rob.</SPEAKER>
<P>But didst thou sirrah <HI>Dick</HI> here my
Wife: when her tongue is upon the pinne of
scolding, (which is almost at all times)
thou wouldst thinke that thou wert a hun|ting
with the Devills Reagles, which
were scenting after a Citie Pettifogging
Lawyer.</P>

<P>I, but is Scoulding her worst

<P>Thou art in iest art thou not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rob.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot tel whether I am in iest
or no; but I am sure I found her making
me a Cuckold in good earnest. Nay, and
Ile tell thee what a tricke shee served mee
too: I like a good honest man, going to
make a dis-iunctive betwixt her and the Sat|tin
doublet, shee like a whore as shee was,
very orderly, leapes out of her bed, and
without any mercie at all, snatches up a
good handsome Crab-sticke, and belaboured
my iacket very handsomely, and when shee
had done, shee went to bed againe unto her
Sattin doublet, to whom shee lay very
closely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what didst thou doe all the
while?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rob.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith Ile tell thee, when I saw
there was no remedy, very faire and honestly
I lighted them with a Candle, for feare least
betwixt them they should make my hornes
grow crooked.</P>

<PB N="4" REF="4">
<SPEAKER>Dick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, thou hadst very hard fortune to
meet with her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rob.</SPEAKER>
<P>Push, Ile tell thee more yet, when we
were married first, if <HI>I</HI> had given her the least
occasion which could bee, she would have been
up very earely in a morning, when her neigh|bours
did thinke like a good huswife shee had
beene up beating of her Bucks, she very coura|giously
was bumbasting of my poore Car|kasse?</P>

<P>Can she fight so well?</P>

for about or two.</P>

well amended now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick.</SPEAKER>
<P>How didst thou doe to tame her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rob.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ile tell you; at length being resolutely
bent with all the might and power I had, I
tide her up to racke and manger, where I kept
her so long fasting, untill shee swore never to
scold, or lift up her hand against mee any
more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick.</SPEAKER>
<P>And hath shee beene as good as her
word.</P>

hee was as faire a speecht fellow as

<L>He set his neighbours by the eares,</L>
<L>And put them in a thousand feares,</L>
<L>His poore wife she shed brinish teares,</L>
<L>For him knave.</L>
<L>He ruled them like as a Lord,</L>
<L>And bound them with a threefold cord,</L>
<L>And all upon his owne accord,</L>
<L>Most basely.</L>
