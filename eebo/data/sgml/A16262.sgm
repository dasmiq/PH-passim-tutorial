<L>Together still wolde they haue gone,</L>
<L>To scole, to meales, to play or game.</L>

<L>Their willes &amp; wits both, like did frame,</L>

<L>He was of noble parentage,</L>
<L>And eke a propre personage:</L>

<L>Your progenie shall long endure,</L>

<L>But Gisippus (for to be short,)</L>
<L>To their counsell woulde not resort:</L>

<L>Whom he so loued, that (well nie)</L>
<L>For other thinges he did not care.</L>
<L>Titus also (a good cause whye)</L>

<L>Suche frendship hath bene sene but rare.</L>
<L>Gisippus fearinge that a wife,</L>

<L>Then with his frend to fall at strife:</L>

<L>Which thoughts made him for to abstain</L>

<L>To all their requestes throughlie graunt:</L>
<L>Titus also did him desire,</L>
<L>That he would not be repugnaunt,</L>

<L>Or els said he their feruent ire,</L>
<L>Against you alway shalbe bent,</L>

<L>Gysippus with this meke request,</L>

<L>With rare and sober talke righte plaine,</L>

<L>But yet he shewed not his smart,</L>
<L>Till they to their lodginges were gone:</L>

<L>He was so hurt with Cupides launce,</L>

<L>When Gysippus (to his greuaunce)</L>

<L>Before the Senate thus he spake,</L>
<L>Most noble fathers euery one, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The con|fession of the these.</NOTE></L>
<L>I am approched peace to make:</L>
<L>I am knowen to be a persone.</L>
<L>Whiche haue manye bie theft vndone,</L>
<L>Titus you knowe assuredlye,</L>
<L>Pleasure in malice he hath none,</L>
<L>But is of much simplisitie:</L>

<PB REF="18">
<L>This straunger eke which standeth by,</L>

<L>His wittes from him being subtract:</L>
<L>They both are gilties of this acte,</L>
<L>The truth plainly I will disclose,</L>
<L>I did that most vngracious fact,</L>
<L>The man from his life to depose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I smot him that he neuer rose,</L>
<L>Then to the barne Iran full right,</L>
<L>Thinking to hide me from my foes:</L>
<L>But when I sawe this wofull wight,</L>
<L>A slepe, thinking myselfe to quight</L>
<L>A policy I thought full good</L>
<L>I tooke his knife, and did it dight,</L>
<L>Both hafte &amp; blade, in the mannes blood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When I had done, in that mad woode,</L>
<L>I brought his blodye knife agayne,</L>
<L>This feate my reason vnderstode</L>
<L>Was best your iudgement to refrayne.</L>
<L>But concience now, doth me constrayne,</L>
<L>To put the giltlesse out of dout,</L>
<L>At your iugdement, will I remaine</L>
<L>Abiding death, though it be stout.</L>

<L>The Senate then and all the rout,</L>
<L>Reioyced and toke good comfort,</L>

In all the court, there was a shout,</L>
<L>Ther neuer was a gladder sort,</L>
<L>To make the tale, more brefe and shorte,</L>

<L>Titus did their frendshippe report,</L>
