<HEAD>EPISTLE TO POTAPSKI.</HEAD>
<P><HI>MOrtuo Ladislao Rege Maximo, Princeps Invictissime, Poloni divino Numine afflati te Regem Suffragiis suis Elegerunt,</HI> For in what manner, Sir, can I better accost your Greatness than in the Method and Form which the Ancient Polonians us'd to Elect their Sovereigns? Your Eternal Fame has spread it self round the World: And doubtless that Head of yours, when first Moulded by Midwife Nature, was Predestinated to wear the Glorious Circle, and be lifted up to that conspicuous point and elevation that the Nations below might look upon it with fear and wonder, and with Satisfaction see the Effects of Popular Wisedom and Machiavilian Policy.</P>
<P>Thus as your Propitious Stars Appoint you, in your Wane of Years, and approaching Evil days of Bitterness and Infirmity, to Possess and Rule, though not to Fill and Enjoy, the Regal Seat; so let your Soul be transform'd from your Old Ambition to a New and more Exalted Modell of Grandeur, and Commence an Arbitrary Government that may make you fear'd and hated by your People; for you know a Monarch never rises to the highest pitch of Greatness till then, and a Prince that is Elected for In|ternal Merit and Mighty Parts as you Expect to be, is rather to be fear'd than belov'd, and consequently ought to depend upon the firm Basis of his more Successfull Power and Policy.</P>
<P>This Counsel, Sir, I am assured is very Natural and Obvious to your Mightiness's Understanding; for who ever knew a setter up of Anarchy, that had not withall a touch of Tyranny? Supreme Power is still the Mark, let the Polititians never so oft play
<PB REF="3">
booty, and shoot awry: And the Devil himself is not so Arbi|trary in his Infernal Sway&punc; as your true Stanch Common wealths|man, that has once got the Reins of Government into his hands. But after all this, if your Fate, according to the common Exi|gence of things, should be Retrograde, and you have onely been dreaming of Royalty all this while, take my Advice and rest in your own Station, for you cannot move in a better Sphere than now you are fixt in&punc; broach some Vessel of new Contriv'd Mis|chiefs, Tap on, Tap on still, you know well enough what will take with the People. And if at any time a Scruple of Conscience afflict or trouble you, look on it onely as a fit of the Gout that pinches and girds for a Moment, but is presently gone, publish your own Vindication with your own hand, and let your own mother Wit dictate to it, trust no Poet with your Cause, unless you pay him well, for to my knowledge it cannot justifie it self. And therefore he that undertakes it deserves a better reward than the single Guiny which you gave one of your Creatures that presented you with <HI>The Character of a Po&mdash;sh Succ&mdash;sor,</HI> and whom I have heard since rail at you inveterately, <HI>facit Indignatio Versus&mdash;</HI> therefore take heed you fall not under the Lash of his Satyr, which if you should, Lord have mercy upon you; for, Sir, I am of Opinion though you are a very <HI>Lu|cifer</HI> at Subtilty and Politicks&mdash;yet you are but a poor Devil at Poetry.</P>
<P>Above all things, Sir, be sure to keep your Wit in repair&punc; get your Head hoop't round as <HI>Boroski's</HI> is, that your Brains may keep in a constant Motion, and not grow Addle by the un|ruly whirling of the Windmills in it, for we begin to suspect by the Shallowness of some late Projects of yours, that in all proba|bility you are declining, which if should happen fatal to ye, Hea|vens! what a Consternation would be upon the People, and what weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth among the blessed Party! however for my part I should never fail to record your memorable Actions, but be always ready, as I am now and ever will be in all humility, to blazon your Greatness's never dying fame, which will doubtless fill a great part of History in our succeeding Ages.</P>

<LG>
<L>VAIN is the Man, and to himself unjust,</L>
<L>That in frail Humane wisdom puts his trust;</L>
<L>As base the Wretch that with Litigious strife</L>
<L>Ruins his Neighbour's Fortune or his Life.</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="4">This wise <HI>Potapski</HI> knew, the mighty he</L>
<L>That stood confirm'd in Rules of Policy,</L>
<L>The Darling Genius of the Mobile.</L>
<L>He knew it, and the Justice of the matter&punc;</L>
<L>But curst Ambition has no moral Nature;</L>
<L>The mistery of Power did still controul,</L>
<L>And found the nearest passage to his Soul:</L>
<L>Strife was his Province, Jars and lasting fewd,</L>
<L>A vile Incendiary, old and lewd,</L>
<L>But sly as th' hissing Demon that betray'd</L>
<L>The yielding Soul of the first lovely Maid,</L>
<L>Or that curst Wretch that with a fatal Wor</L>
<L>And fawning kiss deceiv'd his sacred Lord.</L>
<L>'Mongst all the grave Caballing <HI>Polish</HI> Peers</L>
<L>He was the Mouth, he saw the Nation's fears,</L>
<L>And bred the Causes many fatal Years;</L>
<L>Stanch in Sedition, obstinately Ill,</L>
<L>And own'd no other Master but his Will:</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="4">Thus train'd and foster'd up in this black Art,</L>
<L>Faction and Schism he lowdly did impart;</L>
<L>Carress'd all slavish Proselytes, and fed</L>
<L>The Sons of <HI>Amaleck</HI> with his daily bread;</L>
<L>Made 'em his Parrots, taught 'em how to prate,</L>
<L>And act with him in the grand Scenes of State;</L>
<L>Till hardned with success, and past all shame,</L>
<L>They were made fit to swear, and then to damn.</L>
<L>Through all the tracks of antiquated time,</L>
<L>His fledg'd Ambition still would highest climb;</L>
<L>Loyal as humble Honesty when rais'd,</L>
<L>But Polish and implacable debas'd:</L>
<L>In the late Civil Wars was often try'd,</L>
<L>'Twixt King and Commons could himself divide,</L>
<L>But still had strongest zeal for th' strongest side.</L>
<L>When the loud War Heaven's thunder did out-brave,</L>
<L>Whoever met with danger he was safe;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="5">And sconc't within his bulwark-saddle rode,</L>
<L>To peep who had the better on't abroad;</L>
<L>Just like a Hare could sculk within his form,</L>
<L>Squat, and lie close when clouds foretold a storm.</L>
<L>But, when the gloomy Omens where disperst,</L>
<L>Bolt out to charge and plunder with the rest.</L>
<L>When old gigantick Faction got a head,</L>
<L>By pamper'd lust and Native venome bred,</L>
<L>The buzzing Crowd the fam'd <HI>Potapski</HI> chose</L>
<L>To counsel and assist against their foes,</L>
<L>Well knowing what effectual merit lies</L>
<L><HI>In mischiefs that are villanously wise:</HI></L>
<L>And he that shifted with all sorts of winds,</L>
<L>And chang'd his Politiques to different kinds,</L>
<L>Propos'd and contradicted more or less,</L>
<L>Just as he found their Arms had gain'd success.</L>
<L>None canted better when <HI>Nol</HI> sway'd the Nation,</L>
<L>Or Coopeed finer at the Restauration:</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="5">None knew the value of preferments more,</L>
<L>Or Loyalty new gilt and vernisht o'r;</L>
<L>For when <HI>Potapski</HI> at the Helm was put,</L>
<L>Who counsel'd the Exchequer to be shut?</L>
<L>Or since upon omitting due rewards,</L>
<L>Advis'd the Rabble to pull down the guards?</L>
<L>Variety of Insolence each hour</L>
<L>Confirm'd at large his eager lust of Power,</L>
<L>And though some crimes that justly merit shame,</L>
<L>A while add luster to their Authour's fame,</L>
<L>'Tis like a Meteors momentary light,</L>
<L>Which when extinguish'd darker shows the night.</L>
<L>Thus Necromancers that to gain their ends,</L>
<L>Surrender Souls and Bodies to the Fiends:</L>
<L>During their term sin safe, and, if supprest</L>
<L>In durance, are by trusty Pug releast;</L>
<L>But time expir'd, in horrour end their days,</L>
<L>And Hell that first employ'd their wages pays.</L>

<L>These anxious thoughts so long his Breast did storm,</L>
