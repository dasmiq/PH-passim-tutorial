<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Heartily wish this Play were as perfect as I intended it, that it might be more worthy your acceptance; and that my Dedication of it to you, might be more becoming that Ho|nour and Esteem which I, with every Body, who are so fortunate as to know you, have for you. It had your Countenance when yet un|known; and now it is made publick, it wants your Protection.</P>
<P>And give me leave, without any Flattery to you, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">nity in my self, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> my Illiterate Criticks, as an answer to their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> Objections, that they have found fault with that, which has been pleasing to you. This Play in relation to my concern for its Reputation, succeeded before it was Acted, for thro' your early Patronage it had an audience of several Persons of the first Rank
<PB REF="3">
both in Wit and Quality; and their allowance of it, was a Consequence of your approbation. Therefore if I really wish it might have had a more popular reception; it is not at all in con|sideration of my self; but because I wish well, and would gladly contribute to the benefit of the Stage, and diversion of the Town. They were (not long since) so kind to a very imper|fect Comedy of mine, that I thought my self justly indebted to them all my endeavours for an entertainment that might merit some little of that Applause, which they were so lavish of, when I thought I had no Title to it. But I find they are to be treated cheaply, and I have been at an unnecessary expence.</P>
<P>I would not have any Body imagine, that I think this Play without its Faults, for I am Con|scious of several, and ready to own 'em; but it shall be to those who are able to find 'em out. I confess I design'd (whatever Vanity or Ambition occasion'd that design) to have written a true and regular Comedy, but I found it an undertaking which put me in mind of&mdash;<HI>Sude<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">|straque laboret <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> to make a|mends for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 words"> a design, I do con|fess both the attempt, and the imperfect perfor|mance. Yet I must take the boldness to say, I have not miscarried in the whole; for the Me|chanical part of it is perfect. That, I may say with as little vanity, as a Builder may say he has built
<PB REF="3">
a House according to the Model laid down be|fore him; or a Gardiner that he has set his Flow|ers in a knot of such or such a Figure. I design'd the Moral first, and to that Moral I invented the Fable, and do not know that I have borrow'd one hint of it any where. I made the Plot as strong as I could, because it was single, and I made it single, because I would avoid confusion, and was resolved to preserve the three Unities of the Drama, which I have visibly done to the ut|most severity. This is what I ought not to ob|serve upon my self; but the Ignorance and Ma|lice of the greater part of the Audience is such, that they would make a Man turn Herauld to his own Play, and Blazon every Character. However, Sir, this Discourse is very impertinent to you; whose Judgment, much better can discern the Faults, than I can excuse them; and whose good Nature, like that of a Lover, will find out those hidden Beauties (if there are any such) which it would be great immodesty in me to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">. I think I don't speak improperly when I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 words"> a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> of Poetry; for it is very well known <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 words"> to you; she has not deny'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 words">; you have injoy'd her, and she has been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ruitful in a most Beautiful Issue&mdash;If I break off abruptly here, I hope every Body will understand that it is to a|void a Commendation, which, as it is your due, would be most easie for me to pay, and too trou|blesome for you to receive.</P>
<P><PB REF="4" MS="y">I have since the Acting of this Play hearkned after the Objections which have been made to it; for I was Conscious where a true Critick might have put me upon my defence. I was prepared for their Attack; and am pretty confident I could have vindicated some parts, and excused others; and where there were any plain Miscarriages, I would most ingenuously have confess'd 'em. But I have not heard any thing said sufficient to pro|voke an Answer. Some little snarling and bark|ing there has been, but I don't know one well|mouth'd Curr that has opened at all. That, which looks most like an Objection, does not relate in particular to this Play, but to all or most that ever have been written; and that is Soliloquy. Therefore I will answer it, not only for my own sake, but to save others the trouble, to whom it may hereafter be Objected.</P>
<P>I grant, that for a Man to Talk to himself, appears absurd and unnatural; and indeed it is so in most Cases; but the circumstances which may attend the occasion, make great alteration. It oftentimes happens to a Man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 words"> which require <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 words"> their Nature, cannot admit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 words">. Such, for cer|tain, is all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">nd other less mischievous intentions may be very improper to be Commu|nicated to a second Person. In such a case there|fore the Audience must observe, whether the Person upon the Stage takes any notice of them
<PB REF="4">
at all, or no. For if he supposes any one to be by, when he talks to himself, it is monstrous and ridiculous to the last degree. Nay, not only in this case, but in any part of a Play, if there is expressed any knowledge of an Audience, it is in|sufferable. But otherwise when a Man in Soli|loquy reasons with himself, and <HI>Pro's</HI> and <HI>Con's,</HI> and weighs all his Designs: We ought not to imagine that this Man either talks to us, or to himself; he is only thinking, and thinking such Matter, as were inexcusable Folly in him to speak. But because we are conceal'd Spectators of the Plot in agitation, and the Poet finds it necessary to let us know the whole Mystery of his Contri|vance; he is willing to inform us of this Persons Thoughts, and to that end is forced to make use of the expedient of Speech, no other better way being yet invented for the Communication of Thought.</P>
<P>Another very wrong Objection has been made by some who have not taken leisure to distinguish the Characters. The Hero of the Play as they, are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 words"> him&punc; (meaning <HI>Mellefont</HI>) is a Gull, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">. Is every Man a Gul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 words">? At that rate I'm afraid the two Classes o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">, will be reduc'd to one, and the Knaves themselves be at a loss to justifie their Title: But if an Open|hearted Honest Man, who has an entire Confi|dence in one whom he takes to be his Friend, and
<PB REF="5">
whom he has obliged to be so; and who (to confirm him in his Opinion) in all appearance, and upon several tryals has been so: If this Man be de|ceived by the Treachery of the other; must he of necessity commence Fool immediately, only be|cause the other has proved a Villain? Ay, but there was Caution given to <HI>Mellefont</HI> in the first Act by his Friend <HI>Careless.</HI> Of what Nature was that Caution? Only to give the Audience some light into the Character of <HI>Maskwell,</HI> before his appearance; and not to convince <HI>Mellefont</HI> of his Treachery; for that was more than <HI>Careless</HI> was then able to do: He never knew <HI>Maskwell</HI> guilty of any Villany; he was only a sort of Man which he did not like. As for his suspecting his Fami|liarity with my Lady <HI>Touchwood:</HI> Let 'em exa|mine the Answer that <HI>Mellefont</HI> makes him, and compare it with the Conduct of <HI>Maskwell</HI>'s Cha|racter through the Play.</P>
<P>I would have 'em again look into the Chara|cter of <HI>Maskwell,</HI> before they accuse any Body of weakness for being deceiv'd by him. For <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> on summing up the enquiry into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 words"> find they have only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 words"> Charact<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">r, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 words">.</P>
<P>But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 words"> which I am more concerne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> all the false Criticisms that are made upon me; and that is, some of the Ladies are offended: I am heartily sorry for it, for I declare I would rather disoblige all the Criticks
<PB REF="5">
in the World, than one of the Fair Sex. They are concerned that I have represented some Wo|men Vicious and Affected: How can I help it? It is the Business of a Comick Poet to paint the Vices and Follies of Humane kind; and there are but two Sexes that I know, <HI>viz. Men,</HI> and <HI>Women,</HI> which have a Title to Humanity: And if I leave one half of them out, the Work will be imper|fect. I should be very glad of an opportunity to make my Complement to those Ladies who are offended: But they can no more expect it in a Comedy, than to be Tickled by a Surgeon, when he's letting 'em Blood. They who are Virtuous or Discreet, I'm sure cannot be offended, for such Characters as these distinguish them, and make their Beauties more shining and observ'd: And they who are of the other kind, may ne|vertheless pass for such, by seeming not to be displeased, or touched with the Satyr of this <HI>Comedy.</HI> Thus have they also wrongfully accu|sed me of doing them a prejudice, when I have in reality done them a Service.</P>
<P>I have heard some whispering, as if they in|tended to accuse this Play of Smuttiness and Bawdy: But I declare I took a particular care to avoid it, and if they find any in it, it is of their own making, for I did not design it to be so un|derstood. But to avoid my saying any thing upon a Subject, which has been so admirably handled before, and for their better instruction,
<PB REF="6" MS="y">
I earnestly recommend to their perusal, the Epi|stle Dedicatory before the <HI>Plain-Dealer.</HI></P>
<P>You will pardon me, Sir, for the freedom I take of making Answers to other People, in an Epistle which ought wholly to be sacred to you: But since I intend the Play to be so too, I hope I may take the more liberty of Justifying it, where it is in the right. I hear a great many of the Fools are angry at me, and I am glad of it; for I Writ at them, not to 'em. This is a bold con|fession, and yet I don't think I shall disoblige one Person by it; for no Body can take it to himself, without owning the <HI>Character.</HI></P>
<P>I must now, Sir, declare to the World, how kind you have been to my Endeavours; for in regard of what was well meant, you have excu|sed what was ill perform'd, I beg you would con|tinue the same Method in your acceptance of this Dedication. I know no other way of ma|king a return to that <HI>Charity</HI> you shew'd, in pro|tecting an Infant, but by Enrolling it in your Service, now that it is of Age and come into the World. Therefore be pleased to accept of this as an Acknowledgement of the Favour you have shewn me, and an earnest of the real Service and Gratitude of,</P>

<HEAD>To my Dear Friend Mr. Congreve, On His COMEDY, call'd, The Double-Dealer.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WELL then; the promis'd hour is come at last;</L>
<L>The present Age of Wit obscures the past:</L>
<L>Strong were our Syres; and as they Fought they Writ,</L>
<L>Conqu'ring with force of Arms, and dint of Wit;</L>
<L>Theirs was the Gyant Race, before the Flood;</L>
<L>And thus, when <HI>Charles</HI> Return'd, our Empire stood.</L>
<L>Like <HI>Janus</HI> he the stubborn Soil manur'd,</L>
<L>With Rules of Husbandry the rankness cur'd:</L>
<L>Tam'd us to manners, when the Stage was rude;</L>
<L>And boistrous <HI>English</HI> Wit, with Art indu'd.</L>
<L>Our Age was cultivated thus at length;</L>
<L>But what we gain'd in skill we lost in strength.</L>
<L>Our Builders were, with want of Genius, curst;</L>
<L>The second Temple was not like the first:</L>
<L><PB REF="7">Till You, the best <HI>Vitruvius,</HI> come at length;</L>
<L>Our Beauties equal; but excel our strength.</L>
<L>Firm <HI>Dorique</HI> Pillars found Your solid Base:</L>
<L>The Fair <HI>Corinthian</HI> Crowns the higher Space;</L>
<L>Thus all below is Strength, and all above is Grace.</L>
<L>In easie Dialogue is <HI>Fletcher's</HI> Praise:</L>
<L>He mov'd the mind, but had not power to raise.</L>
<L>Great <HI>Johnson</HI> did by strength of Iudgment please:</L>
<L>Yet doubling <HI>Fletcher's</HI> Force, he wants his Ease.</L>
<L>In differing Tallents both adorn'd their Age;</L>
<L>One for the Study, t'other for the Stage.</L>
<L>But both to <HI>Congreve</HI> justly shall submit,</L>
<L>One match'd in Iudgment, both o'er-match'd in Wit</L>
<L>In Him all Beauties of this Age we see;</L>
<L><HI>Etherege</HI> his Courtship, <HI>Southern's</HI> Purity;</L>
<L>The Satire, Wit, and Strength of Manly <HI>Witcherly:</HI></L>
<L>All this in blooming Youth you have Atchiev'd;</L>
<L>Now are your foil'd Contemporaries griev'd;</L>
<L>So much the sweetness of your manners move,</L>
<L>We cannot envy you because we Love.</L>
<L><HI>Fabius</HI> might joy in <HI>Scipio,</HI> when he saw</L>
<L>A Beardless Consul made against the Law,</L>
<L>And joyn his Suffrage to the Votes of <HI>Rome;</HI></L>
<L>Though He with <HI>Hannibal</HI> was overcome.</L>
<L>Thus old <HI>Romano</HI> bow'd to <HI>Raphel's</HI> Fame;</L>
<L>And Scholar to the Youth he taught, became.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh that your Brows my Lawrel had sustain'd,</L>
<L>Well had I been Depos'd, if You had reign'd!</L>
<L><PB REF="7">The Father had descended for the Son;</L>
<L>For only You are lineal to the Throne.</L>
<L>Thus when the State one <HI>Edward</HI> did depose;</L>
<L>A Greater <HI>Edward</HI> in his room arose.</L>
<L>But now, not I, but Poetry is curs'd;</L>
<L>For <HI>Tom</HI> the Second reigns like <HI>Tom</HI> the first.</L>
<L>But let 'em not mistake my Patron's part;</L>
<L>Nor call his Charity their own desert.</L>
<L>Yet this I Prophecy; Thou shalt be seen,</L>
<L>(Tho' with some short Parenthesis between:)</L>
<L>Hig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> on the Throne of Wit; and seated there,</L>
<L>Not mine (that's little) but thy Lawrel wear.</L>
<L>Thy first attempt an early promise made;</L>
<L>That early promise this has more than paid.</L>
<L>So bold, yet so judiciously you dare,</L>
<L>That Your least Praise, is to be Regular.</L>
<L>Time, Place, and Action, may with pains be wrought,</L>
<L>But Genius must be born; and never can be taught.</L>
<L>This is Your Portion; this Your Native Store;</L>
<L>Heav'n that but once was Prodigal before,</L>
<L>To <HI>Shakespeare</HI> gave as much; she cou'd not give him more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Maintain Your Post: That's all the Fame You need;</L>
<L>For 'tis impossible you shou'd proceed.</L>
<L>Already I am worn with Cares and Age;</L>
<L>And just abandoning th'Ungrateful Stage:</L>
<L>Unprofitably kept at Heav'ns expence,</L>
<L>I live a Rent-charge on his Providence:</L>
<L><PB REF="8">But You, whom ev'ry Muse and Grace adorn,</L>
<L>Whom I foresee to better Fortune born,</L>
<L>Be kind to my Remains; and oh defend,</L>
<L>Against Your Iudgment Your departed Friend!</L>
<L>Let not the Insulting Foe my Fame pursue;</L>
<L>But shade those Lawrels which descend to You:</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, but you shall judge whether I have not reason to be allarm'd. None besides you, and <HI>Maskwell,</HI> are acquaint|ed with the Secret of my Aunt <HI>Touchwood's</HI> violent Passion for me. Since my first refusal of her Addresses, she has en|deavour'd to do me all ill Offices with my Uncle; yet has managed 'em with that subtilty, that to him they have born the face of kindness; while her Malice, like a Dark Lant|horn, onely shone upon me, where it was directed. Still it gave me less perplexity to prevent the success of her displea|sure, than to avoid the importunities of her Love; and of two evils, I thought my self favour'd in her aversion: But whether urged by her despair, and the short prospect of time she saw, to accomplish her designs; whether the hopes of her revenge, or of her Love, terminated in the view of this my Marriage with <HI>Cynthia,</HI> I know not; but this Morning she surpriz'd me in my Bed.&mdash;</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>What at first amaz'd me; for I look'd to have seen her in all the Transports of a slighted and revengful Woman: But when I expected Thunder from her Voice, and Lightning in her Eyes; I saw her melted into Tears, and hush'd into a Sigh. It was long before either of us spoke, Passion had ty'd her Tongue, and Amazement mine.&mdash;In short, the Consequence was thus, she omitted nothing, that the most violent Love could urge, or tender words express; which when she saw had no effect; but still I pleaded Honour and nearness of Blood to my Uncle; then came the Storm I fear'd at first: For starting from my Bed-side like a Fury, she flew to my Sword, and with much ado I prevented her doing me or her self a mischief: having disarm'd her; in a gust of Passi|on
<PB N="5" REF="11">
she left me, and in a resolution, confirm'd by a Thousand Curses, not to close her Eyes, till she had seen my ruin.</P>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>It is so. Well, the Service that you are to do me, will be a Pleasure to your self; I must get you to engage my Lady <HI>Pliant</HI> all this Evening, that my Pious Aunt may not work her to her Interest.

<P>INdeed, Madam! Is it Possible your Ladyship could have been so much in Love?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Froth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I could not sleep; I did not sleep one wink for Three Weeks together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cynt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prodigious! I wonder, want of sleep, and so much Love, and so much Wit as your Ladyship has, did not turn your Brain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Froth.</SPEAKER>
<P>O my Dear <HI>Cynthia,</HI> you must not rally your Friend,&mdash;but really, as you say, I wonder too,&mdash;but then I had a way.&mdash;For between you and I, I had Whymsies and Vapours, but I gave them vent.</P>

<SPEAKER>L. <HI>Froth.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>O Inconsistent! In Love, and not Write! if my Lord and I had been both of your Temper, we had never come together,&mdash;O bless me! What a sad thing would that have been, if my Lord and I should never have met!</P>

<P>A Manner! what's that, Madam?</P>

<P>Some distinguishing Quality, as for example, the <HI>Belle-air</HI> or <HI>Brillant</HI> of Mr. <HI>Brisk;</HI> the Solemnity, yet Com|plaisance of my Lord, or something of his own, that should look a little <HI>Iene-scay quoysh;</HI> he is too much a Mediocrity, in my mind.</P>

<P>I'm thinking, that tho' Marriage makes Man and Wife One Flesh, it leaves 'em still Two Fools; and they become more Conspicuous by setting off one another.</P>

</SP>

<P>Nay, I have known Two Wits meet, and by the opposition of their Wits, render themselves as ridiculous as Fools. 'Tis an odd Game we're going to Play at: What think you of drawing Stakes, and giving over in time?</P>

<SPEAKER>Care.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Pox I can't get an Answer from her, that does not begin with her Honour, or her Vertue, her Religion, or some such Cant. Then she has told me the whole History of Sir <HI>Paul</HI>'s nine years Courtship; how he has lain for whole nights together upon the Stairs, before her Chamber-door; and that the first Favour he receiv'd from her, was a piece of an old Scarlet Petticoat for a Stomacher; which, since the day of his Marriage, he has, out of a piece of Gallantry, con|verted into a Night-Cap, and wears it still with much Solem|nity on his anniversary Wedding-night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I have seen, with the Ceremony thereunto be|longing - for on that night he creeps in at the Bed's Feet like a gull'd Bassa that has married a Relation of the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s, and that night he has his arms at liberty. Did not she tell you at what a distance she keeps him. He has con|fess'd to me that but at some certain times, that is I suppose when she apprehends being with Child, he never has the privilege of using the familiarity of a Husband with his Wife. He was once given to scrambling with his hands and spraw|ling in his Sleep; and ever since she has him swaddled up in Blankets, and his hands and feet swath'd down, and so put to bed; and there he lies with a great Beard, like a <HI>Russian</HI> Bear upon a drift of Snow. You are very great with him, I won|der he never told you his Grievances, he will I warrant you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Care.</SPEAKER>
<P>Excessively foolish&mdash;But that which gives me most hopes of her, is her telling me of the many Temptations she has resisted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, then you have her; for a woman's bragging to a man that she has overcome Temptations, is an argu|ment that they were weakly offered, and a challenge to him to engage her more irresistably. 'Tis only an inhancing the price of the Commodity, by telling you how many Custo|mers have underbid her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Care.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I don't despair&mdash;but still she has a grudging to you&mdash;I talk'd to her t'other night at my Lord <HI>Fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">th</HI>'s Masquerade, when I'm satisfied she knew me, and I had no

reason to complain of my Reception; but I find women are not the same bare-faced and in Masks, and a Vizor&mdash;disguises their Inclinations as much as their Faces.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a mistake, for women may most properly be said to be unmask'd when they wear Vizors; for that secures them from blushing, and being out of Countenance, and next to being in the dark, or alone, they are most truly themselves in a Vizor Mask. Here they come, I'll leave you. Ply her close, and by and by clap a <HI>Billet doux</HI> into her hand: For a woman never thinks a man truly in love with her, till he has been fool enough to think of her out of her sight, and to lose so much time as to write to her.</P>

<P>My Mind gives me it wont&mdash;because we are both so willing; we each of us strive to reach the Gole, and hinder one another in the Race; I swear it never do's well when the Parties are so agreed&mdash;for when People walk hand in hand, there's neither overtaking nor meeting: We Hunt in Couples where we both pursue the same Game, but forget one another; and 'tis because we are so near that we don't think of coming together.</P>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE:</HEAD>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mrs. <HI>Mountford.</HI></STAGE>
<L>COuld Poets but forsee how Plays would take,</L>
<L>Then they could tell what Epilogues to make;</L>
<L>Whether to thank or blame their Audience&punc; most:</L>
<L>But that late knowledge, does much hazard cost,</L>
<L>Till Dice are thrown, there's nothing won, nor lest.</L>
<L>So till the Thief has stol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">'n, he cannot know</L>
<L>Whether he shall escape the Law, or no.</L>
<L>But Poets run much greater hazards far,</L>
<L>Than they who stand their Trials at the Bar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">;</L>
<L>The Law provides a curb for 'its own Fury,</L>
<L>And suffers Iudges to direct the Iury.</L>
<L>But in this Court, what difference does appear!</L>
<L>For every one's both Iudge and Iury here;</L>
<L>Nay, and what's worse, an Executioner.</L>
<L>All have a Right and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">itle to some part,</L>
<L>Each chusing that, in which he has most Art.</L>
<L>The dreadful men of Learning, all Confound,</L>
<L>Unless the Fable's good, and Moral sound.</L>
<L>The Vizor-Masks, that are in Pit and Gallery,</L>
<L>Approve, or Damn the Repartee and Rallery.</L>
<L>The Lady Criticks, who are better Read,</L>
<L>Enquire if Characters are nicely bred;</L>
<L>If the soft thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> are Penn'd and spoke with grace:</L>
<L>They Iudge of Action too, and Time, and Place;</L>
<L>In which, we do not doubt but they're discerning,</L>
<L>For that's a kind of <HI>Assignation Learning.</HI></L>
<L>Beaus Iudge of Dress; the Witlings Iudge of Songs;</L>
<L>The Cuckold<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">m, of Ancient Right&punc; to Cits belongs.</L>
<L>Thus poor Poets, the Favour are deny'd;</L>
<L>Even to make exceptions, when they're Try'd.</L>
<L>'Tis hard that they must every one admit;</L>
<L>Methinks I see some Faces in the Pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">,</L>
<L>Which must of Consequence be Foes to Wit.</L>
<L>You who can Iudge, to Sentence may proceed;</L>
<L>But tho' he cannot Write, let him be freed</L>
<L>At least from their Contempt, who cannot Read.</L>
