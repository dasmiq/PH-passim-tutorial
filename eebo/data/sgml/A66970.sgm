<P>THere is nothing (Pious <HI>Reader</HI>) wherein a Christian can receiue a greater dam|mage in order to Saluation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect;. I&punc;</NOTE> then to be any way misinformed, or prejudiced concerning <HI>Prayer:</HI> and too much pains cannot be taken in en|deavouring to satisfy all doubts and scruples raised on this subject. I have therfore thought fit to enlarge myself in this ensuing discourse, not only in discussing punctually page by page that part of <HI>Doctour Stilling fleets</HI> late Book that handles this matter, but also in premising (for the <HI>Readers</HI> benefit) a more Generall Account of the <HI>Church's Doctrine</HI> and <HI>Practice</HI> herein; as being the most fundamen|tall part of a Christians Duty, and wherein Man, whil'st here on earth, entertains a nearer conversation with Heaven; as also the instrument, by which he derives from thence all other <HI>Graces</HI> and <HI>Blessings,</HI> Spirituall or Temporall.</P>
<P>And here I may first say this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect;. II.</NOTE> in my entrance vpon this task; that there is no part of Re|ligion, wherein the <HI>Roman Catholick</HI> Church might think herself more secure from blame and censure; and wherein her extraordinary care and prudence for the right Guidance of her children in this Holy exercise (as appears by the great store of writings vpon this sub|ject) doth more deserue praise euen from her Adversaries; all Sects borrowing from Her, <HI>Rules</HI> and <HI>Patterns</HI> for <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Meditation;</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="4">
as the Catholick Books on this subject tran|slated and rendred common among them do abundantly witness. For, from whom can they learn these so well, as from those, who most practise Prayer? and who are they, but those who also vse solitude and Retirement, and a sequestration of themselues from all unnecessary secular affaires, to attend altoge|ther on this Holy exercice, who renounce all worldly wealth, and prevent the trouble of a conjugal life, of children, family, and the like, and so both the cares of this world, and the necessary causes thereof, that so they may calmely and quietly entertain a closer communication with God, and have their <HI>conversation in Heaven,</HI> whilst here on Earth: Or to vse the Apostles language, 1. Cor. 7. that so <HI>they may giue themselves to Fasting, and Prayer.</HI> ver. 5. <HI>may be without solicitude</HI> ver. 32. <HI>may take care only for the things of the Lord, how they may please the Lord.</HI> Ib. and <HI>that they may attend upon him without distraction</HI> ver. 35. Which they doing, I hope it may seem no wonder, if God also vse a greater familiarity towards them, delight to be with them; he and those of his Court; and shew them grea|ter Kindnes, who love him more (or nothing but him:) and whom also he loves more: who is no mans debter in love; and who also loveth first, otherwise they could not love him at all; <HI>&amp; magit amat, &amp; ante.</HI></P>

who lived immediatly after his time. I descend no further to later times, because, possibly, they may have with Protestants lesse credit.</P>
<P>These are the lives of such as were univer|sally reputed <HI>Saints</HI> in the Church of God till the late Reformation;<NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect;.

Relaters, may proceed, for any thing I know, a litle further; and say, that <HI>Christianity</HI> (de|pending also on <HI>Tradition</HI>) is so; and he, who, granting them not forged, yet calls them <HI>En|thusiasmes,</HI> or frauds, and <HI>delusions</HI> of the evil Spirit, must make the Holiest lives that have appeared in Gods Church to have bin the grea|test impostures; and these deceits also to have bin seconded with the Gift of <HI>Prophecy,</HI> and <HI>Miracles</HI>; which, in like manner, occurr in the same stories; and these <HI>latter</HI> serve to jus|tify the <HI>former.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect;.

But, the application they have made of this name, here, to the Catholicks is somwhat like an ill sort of Argument, that, by proving too much (that is, all <HI>Antiquity</HI> Fanatick too) proves nothing; Nay renders the impu|ter of it a Fanatick; if a Private Spirit, op|posing the Publick one of the Church of all Ages since the Apostles, may be called so.
<PB N="9" REF="6">
But with whatever terms of reproach these Divine Favours are blasphemed by Strangers to them, it hath pleased his Divine Majesty in all times to honour his Church with them; and to convert many to the Christian Faith by them; and she must with all gratitude pro|fess them; and particularly, that not without these <HI>Divine Inspirations,</HI> though also more principally upon the <HI>Evangelicall Counsels</HI> de|livered by our Lord, and his Apostles, as also the precedent Examples of Scripture-Saints, all the Orders of <HI>Religion</HI> in any Age, that are erected in, and allowed by, the Church, have bin founded.</P>

Such extraordinary and <HI>Supernaturall</HI> Illuminations, Inspirations &amp;c. we then must acknowledge not unfrequent in the Catholick Church. They occurr every where in the <HI>Ecclesiasticall</HI> Records of latter and former times; and tis too late now generally to cry them down. And these we find also ordinarily not conferred, save on such per|sons, as are also registred there to have bin ve|ry eminent for the Sanctity of their lives; and among other vertues much addicted to <HI>Prayer Solitude,</HI> and <HI>Contemplation</HI>; and lastly a many of them Such, as we see, before Protestancy was borne, set down in the Churches Ka|lendar, for Saints; So that if these things must be stiled <HI>Fanaticisme,</HI> we find, that the holier the Persons, the greater Fanaticks.</P>

<PB N="13" REF="8">
cannot be made without much temerity, and I am afraid, without blaspheming the Holy Ghost, (a crime, we know, of what weight;) especially when such a Censure proceeds point blank against the judgment of the Church, to whom the publick discerning of Spirits is committed.</P>
<P>For, thus, for example, S Paul, if his <HI>Apostle-ship</HI> did not priviledge him, must have bin declared clearly a <HI>Fanatick,</HI> when he saith, that the Gospel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 1.12.</NOTE> which others learnt from the instruction of the Apostles, he received from our Lord meerly <HI>by Revelation</HI>; and again Gal. 2.2. that he went vp to Ierusalem, at such a time, <HI>by Revelation,</HI> and when, in his speech to the Iews Act. 22. he pretended a vision he had as he was praying in the Tem|ple, and elsewhere frequent and long Collo|quies with our Lord (see Act. 22.17. &amp;c. 26.15.16.17.&mdash; 2. Cor. 12.19.) and, when we are told so often of the Holy Spirit spea|king to him, and others. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Act. 10.19.20. Act. 16.6.7 9.20.22.23. Act. 8.19.21. Tim. 1.18. 4.14.</NOTE> (doubtless by some interiour voice, or other signification clearly discerned by them to be from God:) vvhen again he relates his <HI>Rapt,</HI> his aliena|tion from his Senses; and, vncertain whe|ther, from his Body; and his hearing <HI>ineffa|ble words.</HI> And the strange joy and transport of mind he received from these things was so great and extraordinary, as that it seems it vvas necessary to be allayed and qualified with some counter griefs, I say how could he escape the imputation of a <HI>Fanatick,</HI> on these terms, but that he was an <HI>Apostle</HI>?</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="9"><NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect;.

Sam. 6.14. Ps. 26.6.&mdash; 2. King. 4.35.- 2.16. compared with. Act. 8.39. and 1. Kings. 18.12.- Ezech. 3.12.14. 2. King. 9.11.&mdash; 1.

They in these Raptures not only fore-telling things to come. (2. King. 2.3.5.) but conceiving, and on a sudden (after an unusvall manner) dictating Psalms, Songs, Praises of God, or explication of some Mystery, or former Pro|phesy, like those vnder the Gospel. 1. Cor. 14.6. See. 1. Sam. 18.10.- 1. King. 18.29.- 1. Chron. 25.3. compared with. 1. Cor. 11.5.

Amongst which means one was calming or charming, and abstracting the Mind by Musick 1. Sam. 10.5.&mdash; 16.16.&mdash; Psal. 43.4.&mdash; 2. King. 3.15. and we know, what vse, herein, the Holy

leave to add, both for the Antiquity and particularity of it, vvhat Tertullian relates, of another pious vvoman Well known to him, in his book <HI>De Anim&acirc;.</HI>
<Q>Est hodie <HI>(saith he)</HI> Soror apud nos Revelationum Charismata sortita, quas in Ecclesia inter Dominica Solen|nia per Extasim in spiritu patitur, conversatur cum Angelis, aliquando etiam cum Domino; &amp; videt, &amp; audit Sacramenta, &amp; quorun|dam corda dignoscit, &amp; medicinas desideranti|bus submittit.

(Where note that the Revelation of the Holy vvoman might be most true, and yet Tertullians collection from it very erro|neous; that is, that souls vvere aeriall Bo|dies, because that of some person deceased appeared to this sister like one.) This is a sub|ject hath no end.

to be best, for his glory, and our good, to be done; though such omission or neglect, amounts not to a sin, but to a failing so much in Perfection. And indeed the not vigilantly observing these Motions of the Spirit within vs, and the not hearkning to and obeying them when evident to be such, or also, the not preconsulting by prayer what it adviseth, but rather precipitating our action to prevent it, is the Reason of so many their no greater improvement in the Spirit, and that they are such strangers to it, and It to them; is a check to the further, and stronger operations of it in the Soul; (for who would offer Counsel, seldome, or never accepted, or asked?) abates the fervour, and solace, that there would be in prosecuting it's suggestions and leave vs guilty of much vnkindnes, and ingratitude.

<PB N="36" REF="20">
are Supernatural and Divine. So, S. Austin <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Confess. l. 6. c. 13.</NOTE> relates of his Mother Monica, that she clearly knew such Supernatural actings in her from her own imaginations.&mdash; <HI>Dicebat enim, discernere se nescio quo sapore, quem ver|bis explicare non poterat, quid interesset inter re|velantem Te, &amp; animam suam somniantem.</HI> And indeed, if such interiour Divine operations Were not somtimes certainly discernable, how could S. Paul be assured, when he intended to preach the Word in Asia, and again in Bi|thynia, (a most charitable designe!) that the <HI>Spirit</HI> forbad it; and not rather the Enemy of the publishing of the Gospel? Act. 16.6.7.&mdash; or, That it was <HI>by Revelation,</HI> and not a fancy of his, that he ascended to Jerusalem? Gal. 2.2. Or, That it Was the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> that <HI>testified,</HI> and not men's fears, that much affliction should happen to him there? Act. 20.23. How the Corinthians knew, when they had a Revelation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cor. 14.</NOTE> that it was not a work of their own imagination? since all these things were transacted only interiourly in the Soul, and it was the Holy Spirit only, that in all these gave the evidence to itself. A certain Assu|rance then, it cannot be denyed, that some at somtimes may have of Divine operations in them. But yet it is not affirmed here, that all persons, less advanced in Prayer, and Purity of life, or also the greatest Saints at all times, discern the operations of the Holy Spirit within them so clearly in this sort of actions, as not to be somtimes mistaken; and it is suf|ficient, that persons piously disposed, and

frequent in Prayer, may have a rational pre|sumption of it as hath been said: Neither is any more communicated vnto them, perhaps, for the better preserving of their Humility.

Infinite are the Books written on this Divine Art of Prayer; Wherein like a careful Mother, she trains vp her children, by certain degrees, from the lowest step thereof, which touches

the ground, to the highest, which reaches to heaven; knowing it to be the Foundation of all Goodnes; and the Attractive of all the Divine Benedictions, and Benefits.</P>
<P>She then, first here, in preparation for Prayer, adviseth her Children to a serious en|deavour to keep their conscience clear from Mortal sin (or also Venial, as much as hu|mane frailty permits;) and to a care of avoi|ding the occasions thereof, without which endeavour our devotions cannot be accepta|ble to God; I mean, as to the receiving from him any great plenty of his Grace: And, again, requires, at such times of Prayer, a dismission of, and abstraction from all secu|lar busines; Solitude, and a recollection of the mind and thoughts, and oblivion, so much as we can, of all creatures; and a re|moving also of all hindrances, that may come from the objects of the exteriour senses, &amp;c. These presupposed; She first begins to feed her little ones with milk, and as it were to chew their meat for them; giving them infi|nite prescriptions, for all occasions, of se|veral <HI>Formes</HI> of <HI>Vocal Prayer,</HI> where Novices begin; and Which the most perfect, also return to.</P>
<P>From these <HI>Vocal,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect;. XXVI.</NOTE> she next leads them on to <HI>Mental,</HI> Prayer; where their devotions may enjoy more liberty, whatever way they are bent, without their former confinement to set Words, or Forms; and where the cessa|tion from external action renders the inward more attent, and affective (as experience
<PB N="40" REF="22">
shews;) and more freed from the distraction of the senses, and also from the wandring of the Thoughts; to which vocal Prayer gives more relaxation: Nor is it so easy to think, as to speak, one thing and mind another; but, for how long time the attention ceaseth, so long doth Mental Prayer; and we are either not distracted, or not praying. Here likewise she delivers them many vseful <HI>Sub|jects</HI> of <HI>Meditation,</HI> chiefly these either tou|ching our own misery; or the Misteries of our Saluation; or the Divine Perfections. The Negative benefit also of which Medita|tions, confined to some certain Subject, at the first is very considerable&punc; in preventing distraction of thoughts, and taking of the mind from it's usual amusements, and wings about external, worldly, vain, and super|fluous things: The Books written in this kind are almost infinite, not vnfrequent in Protestants hands, and on each subject some brief <HI>Heads</HI> perscribed, whereon the Medi|tants may enlarge their thoughts; Where also she directs the <HI>reading</HI> of some Pious <HI>Book,</HI> when there is much distraction of Thoughts, or sterility of Invention. And, in these <HI>Meditations,</HI> She trains them first more in those, of the <HI>knowledge</HI> of their <HI>natural</HI> con|dition, of the <HI>Hainousness</HI> of <HI>Sin</HI>; of the <HI>Di|vine Iustice</HI>; of the <HI>bitter Passion</HI> of our <HI>Lord</HI> in making Satisfaction for sin; of the <HI>Terrours</HI> of the <HI>Tria Novissima,</HI> 1.<HI>Death.</HI> 2. <HI>Iudgment,</HI> 3. <HI>Hell;</HI> and the like: to plant in them <HI>a due Fear</HI> of God, and advance all sorts of <HI>Mortifi|cation</HI>

and a cleansing of themselves from the former habits of Sins.

<P><HI>That bitter enemy of theirs called Reason</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>This Author is a great Common Reason Man;<NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect;. XLIII.</NOTE> and often appeals, and summons vs to the Barr of <HI>Reason</HI>; and would perswade, that the Religion of Catholicks is no Reasonable Religion. But it is noted (which is some pre|judice to him and his party) that all Hereticks have always done the like. Nay it is also Clear, that they cannot do otherwise. For, since a cause must be defended either by Au|thority or Reason, (for who will at once affront both these?) whilst these men do op|pose the one, they are driven to pretend the other. To clear this matter, I suppose by Reason is not meant here meerly arguing, or reasoning: for this is, and must be&punc; vsed equally on all sides, on all Subjects, either when wee dispute for, or against Reason. Here then must be mean't, the Naturall Prin|ciples of Reason that Catholicks are enemies to. And, contrarily, Catholicks affirm, that neither they, nor their Religion maintains (though indeed many things above, yet) any thing contrary to, true Reason; or any true Principle thereof. For, <HI>omne verum omni vero consonat</HI>? But notwithstanding first they con|tend, that many things in Religion may seem contrary to the best Arguments which we
<PB N="66" REF="35">
have from seeming Reason, or from the see|ming Principles thereof; and so, that seeming Reason (for, true, all things considered, never can do so) dictates one thing to vs, and Reli|gion, or Divine Revelation, another: and, that here all seeming contrary Reason, I add, or also sense whatever, is to yield to an vn|doubted <HI>Revelation</HI>: and the <HI>certainty</HI> of Such <HI>Revelation,</HI> only, is abundantly sufficient to proue the contrary to be no true <HI>Principle</HI> of <HI>Reason,</HI> nor true information of Sense. And nothing is more Reasonable then this; be|cause Gods Revelation carries also the Divine Reason (if I may so say) or knowledge along with it; which is above man's. 2. Ca|tholicks affirm, that, as many things in Re|ligion are contrary to seeming Reason; so many go above or beyond the latitude, or capacity of Reason. In which though our Reason apprehends that these things are so, they are proposed to it; and apprehended also some Motives, why, in prudence, it may be|lieve them to be so; yet from its own Princi|ples it cannot comprehend, why, or how, they are so: Nor can discover any such things by its own light. <HI>Animalis homo non percipit, quae sunt Spiritus Dei; stultitia enim illi, &amp; non potest intelligere, quia Spiritualiter examinan|tur.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">1.

Indeed the greatest disturbance we find in our prayers (and therfore it needs to be no wonder if the Mysticks speak so much of them) is from these <HI>Images</HI> of wordly things; so lively drawn and imprinted in our Fancy by our much trafficking with them, that the Soul at her devotions is frequently casting her eye aside, vpon them: And the greatest art of a christian is to deface these Images there, as much as he can, that he may keep his mind fixed on somthing much nobler, and better: and the way to obliterate them again is, to sequester ourselves, as much as necessity and duty permits, from negotiating with these <HI>wordly affaires,</HI> and <HI>cares,</HI> that ne|cessarily stay them there.</P>

<P><HI>What means that saying in the Spirituall exercises,</HI> &amp;c. I have an Edition of the Spirituall Exercises printed at vienna 1563&punc; that is after S. Ignatius his death (and ther|fore nothing added to them since;) and be|fore 1574. wherein I can find no such pas|sage. Nor is it (as this Author confesseth) to be found in the later <HI>Impressions.</HI> Is he not then hard put to it, to find <HI>fuell</HI> enough for enflaming the popular hate against Catho|licks, that runs to such old Editions for it (and this only out of a report, not knowledge, that it is there) when the newer do not supply it; Nor yet will forgive nor forget their fault (Suppose one) when he finds, they have amended it? But now to consider the words, so happily discovered. The words are these&mdash;
<Q>It is the great perfection of a Christian to keep himself indifferent to do what God shall reveal to him, and not to determine himself indifferent to do what he hath al|ready revealed, and taught in the Gospell.</Q>
Their sence must either be this; that S. Igna|tius directs his Sons <HI>not to determine</HI> them|selves to do what God hath already revea|led, and taught in the Gospell, but to keep themselves indifferent to do the contrary, if revealed to them. Or <HI>els That they are not to determine themselves to do only what God hath al|ready revealed, and taught in the Gospel.</HI> (that is as to the things commanded, and prohibited there;) <HI>but also to keep themselves indifferent</HI> (as to the things on either side lawful to be
<PB N="112" REF="58">
done) to do that, which God shall reveal to them. that is, shall reveal to them, recom|mending it to him in Prayer, by the internal illuminations and inspirations of his Holy Spirit to be, <HI>ad majorem Dei Gloriam,</HI> and more conformable to his will. Of which much hath bin said before &sect;. 21. &amp;c. Of these two senses the former is too gross and impious in conscience for S. Ignatius to prescribe to his whole Order in a book pretending Devotion, and so publick in the face of the whole Church; let this Glorious Saint be supposed as great an Hypocrire or Fanatick as this Au|thor would make him. For what Fanatick will say so much? In the latter sense I see no harm vnless the word (<HI>reveale</HI>) displease; but then change it into <HI>God shall inspire them,</HI> and the Protestants common Prayer Book will iustify the language.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect;. LXXXIV.</NOTE><HI>That is for new and strange Revelations too,</HI> &amp;c. If Mother Iuliana's Revelations have many things new and strange, yet, if therein be nothing contrary to Faith or <HI>Good manners,</HI> nor words taken in a modern-improper sence will amount to Heresy, I hope this Author will not put her in the List of his Fanaticks, vnless he can make good the same of them; or, that he can prove her old English to be Fanaticism, but then let Chaucer also look to himself.</P>

(that is, Ecclesiasticall Superiours) than to make their Office the keeping of Mad|men, had he remembred that the Church of England in her Liturgy recommends <HI>Confes|sion</HI>; but, this, so litle practised, he might the easier forget it. Men chained can do no harm; as Fanaticks are in the Roman Church, thanks to their Holy keepers; and for the persons vnder such custody, their being sober, or mad, (for, either they may be) it is fit the Church should rather iudge of it then this Author; who here pronounceth that <HI>Madness,</HI> which these Confessors, and the Church take for <HI>Perfection.</HI> And so it is, that All persons being diligently watched by these keepers, those judged Fanaticks by the Church, all, sooner, or later, even all those with much pains col|lected in this Book by this Author, that were truly Such, have bin crushed by her hither|to; and have no present being: I wish it were so with the English Fanaticks. But whilst they do impose no such keepers over them, nor can iustly deny that liberty of iudgment to others, which they have taken to them|selves, what hope is there of their suppression, or, what iust Laws, I mean Ecclesiasticall, can there be made for it?</P>
<P><HI>We are not to think that the Principles,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect;. LXXXVI.</NOTE> &amp;c. For the seditious or rebellious facts of any Fanaticks in the Catholick Church diso|beying, or breaking loose from their keepers, if any such can be proued by this Author, they are not iustified by the Church, or its <HI>Principles,</HI> and so he looseth his labour in
<PB N="114" REF="59">
thinking to preiudice the Church by them, any more, than by proving some Adulterers, Homicides, Blasphemers to have bin in it. And within the memory of man the Church of England was not free from having such facts committed by some of her Body and Communion; yet, I suppose this Author will maintain, without her guilt.</P>
<P>And here I take of my Pen wearied with following a person whose sense much fails his rage against the Catholick Church; and who hath much more of Raillery, then Rea|son: Hoping these, short Animadversions may conduce some what, if not to the vndeceiving of himself (for I fear his defect lyes not there) yet of others, in a matter of the greatest con|sequence, <HI>Devotion.</HI></P>
