<Q><HI>Then</HI> beware lest thou forget the Lord, who brought thee out of the Land of AEgypt.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHen I look back upon the <HI>Church</HI> in all her motions out of the <HI>East,</HI> obser|ving how <HI>Monarchy</HI> and <HI>Learning</HI> have been at once the two <HI>Shoulders</HI> to bear her <HI>up,</HI> and withall the two <HI>Legs</HI> to bring her <HI>hither;</HI> And when again I do reflect upon our <HI>twenty</HI> years <HI>sins,</HI> which were the complicated Cause of our <HI>twelve</HI> years sufferings; I mean our <HI>drunkenness</HI> and <HI>luxury,</HI> which were deservedly prescribed so long a <HI>Fast;</HI> the <HI>rashness</HI> and <HI>vanity</HI> of our
<PB N="2" REF="4">
<HI>oathes,</HI> which gave us a miserable opti|on betwixt a <HI>perjury,</HI> and an <HI>undoing;</HI> our profanation of the <HI>Quire,</HI> which turn'd us out of the <HI>Cathedral,</HI> our gross <HI>neglect</HI> of <HI>Gods Service,</HI> which helpt to <HI>vote down</HI> our publick <HI>Liturgie;</HI> our ge|neral <HI>idleness</HI> and <HI>sloth,</HI> which often cast us out of our Houses, and as it were set us to eat our Bread in the <HI>sweat</HI> of our <HI>brows,</HI> or of our <HI>brains;</HI> our <HI>unpro|fitable</HI> walking under all God's methods and <HI>means</HI> of <HI>Grace,</HI> which left us no|thing but his <HI>Iudgements</HI> (for many sad years) to work upon us; And yet again when I consider, That <HI>God hath turn'd</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 126. 4.</NOTE> <HI>our Captivity as the Rivers of the South,</HI> and cast the Locusts out of our Vine|yards, <HI>that we may sit under our Vines;</HI> injoying <HI>our Iudges as at the first, and</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 1. 26.</NOTE> <HI>our Counsellors as at the Beginning;</HI> And that the <HI>use</HI> we are to make of so <HI>mira|culous</HI> a <HI>Recovery,</HI> is to be sedulous in providing against the Danger of a <HI>Re|lapse;</HI> To <HI>sin no more</HI> after pardon, <HI>for fear a worse thing happen unto us;</HI> I<NOTE PLACE="marg">Joh. 5. 14.</NOTE> think I cannot be transported with a
<PB N="3" REF="4">
more <HI>innocent Ambition,</HI> because I can|not be <HI>ambitious</HI> of a more <HI>profitable at|tempt,</HI> then that of bringing down the <HI>Heads</HI> of certain Hearers into their <HI>Hearts;</HI> that what is <HI>now</HI> no more than <HI>Light,</HI> may by that means become <HI>Fire;</HI> That we may All (in this sense) be like the Baptist, not only <HI>shining,</HI> but <HI>burning</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Joh. 5. 35.</NOTE> <HI>Lamps;</HI> not only <HI>beautified</HI> with the <HI>knowledge</HI> of Christian duties, but <HI>zealous</HI> too in the <HI>discharge;</HI> as <HI>unaffectedly pun|ctual</HI> in all our carriage, as the greatest Enemies of Godliness are <HI>hypocritically precise.</HI> And though <HI>Heresies</HI> are to be <HI>hated,</HI> as things which lead unto <HI>de|struction,</HI> yet that <HI>Vice</HI> may be reckon'd the <HI>worst</HI> of Heresies, by how much the <HI>error</HI> of a mans <HI>practise</HI> is worse then <HI>that</HI> of his bare <HI>opinion.</HI></P>
<P>Last of all, when I consider, That though <HI>Peace</HI> is a <HI>blessing,</HI> and the <HI>grea|test</HI> in its <HI>kind,</HI> yet many <HI>consequences</HI> of Peace are but <HI>glittering Snares,</HI> and that the things which are given us as <HI>helps</HI> to <HI>memory,</HI> are apt to make us <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Isa. 5. 12. Hab. 1. 13, 16. Amos 6. 1, 3. Hos. 13. 6.</NOTE> <HI>for|getful</HI> of <HI>Him</HI> that <HI>gave</HI> them, I cannot
<PB N="4" REF="5">
think of a fitter Text for the giving advantage to my Design, then This Re|markable <HI>Caveat</HI> to the People of God, against <HI>forgetfulness</HI> and <HI>ingratitude</HI> a|midst the <HI>pleasant Effects</HI> of a <HI>Restaura|tion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>When the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the Land, to give thee great and goodly Cities, and Houses full of all good things, when thou shalt have eaten, and art Full;</HI> THEN <HI>beware that thou forget not the Lord, who brought thee out of the Land of Egypt.</HI></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<P>AT the very first view of which holy <HI>Caveat,</HI> there are <HI>five</HI> particulars of Remarque which presently meet my ob|servation. As first, the <HI>Downfal</HI> of a Nation, 2^l^y the <HI>Deliverance,</HI> 3^l^y the <HI>Author</HI> of that Deliverance, 4^l^y the <HI>Du|ty</HI> by him injoyn'd, and lastly the <HI>Iun|cture</HI> of <HI>affairs</HI> wherein this Duty is most in <HI>season.</HI></P>
<P>And of all these Particulars each is the <HI>greatest</HI> in its kind too. For</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="5">First behold the <HI>greatest Curse</HI> that any<NOTE PLACE="marg">I.</NOTE> poor Nation can struggle under. A <HI>yoke</HI> of <HI>Bondage</HI> and <HI>Captivity,</HI> impos'd by the <HI>hardest</HI> and <HI>worst</HI> of men. A <HI>yoke</HI> so insupportable to some mens <HI>Necks,</HI> that I remember <HI>Hegesistratus</HI> (a cap|tive Souldier in <HI>Herodotus</HI>) would rather<NOTE PLACE="marg">Herodot. in Calliope.</NOTE> <HI>cut off</HI> his <HI>legs,</HI> then <HI>indure</HI> his <HI>Fetters;</HI> that by the <HI>loss</HI> of his <HI>Feet,</HI> he might be enabled to <HI>run away.</HI> So insuffera|ble a thing is the <HI>state</HI> of <HI>Thraldome,</HI> ve|ry significantly imply'd in the <HI>Land of Egypt,</HI> and exegetically express'd by <HI>the House of Bondage.</HI></P>
<P>But yet the <HI>Curse</HI> is so set, (like <HI>Sha|dows</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">II.</NOTE> in a <HI>Picture,</HI> or <HI>Foyles</HI> with <HI>Dia|monds,</HI>) as to commend and illustrate the <HI>greatest Blessing.</HI> A <HI>Deliverance</HI> brought about by such a miraculous complication, that nothing but the <HI>ex|perience</HI> that so it is, can extenuate the <HI>wonder</HI> that so it <HI>should</HI> be. A People groaning under the pressures of several Centuries of years, and so <HI>accustom'd</HI> unto the <HI>yoke,</HI> as to have made it a kind of <HI>acquired Nature</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign">, as <HI>Galen</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="6">
speaks) <HI>de Terr&acirc; AEgypti eductus est,</HI> is now at last <HI>brought out</HI> of the land of Egypt.&mdash;And yet the wonder begins to cease, Because</P>
<P>The <HI>Author</HI> of this Deliverance is so<NOTE PLACE="marg">III.</NOTE> much the <HI>greatest</HI> to be imagin'd, that he is <HI>Dominus, the Lord;</HI> the Lord that <HI>stretcheth out the heavens;</HI> the Lord that<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 40 22.</NOTE> <HI>layeth the foundations of the earth;</HI> the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 104. 5.</NOTE> Lord that <HI>formeth the spirit of man with|in</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Zech. 12. 1.</NOTE> <HI>him.</HI> The Lord in whose <HI>Hand</HI> are the <HI>hearts</HI> of all men; who <HI>turneth man</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 90. 3.</NOTE> <HI>to Destruction, and again who saith, Come again ye children of men.</HI> In a word, It is the <HI>Lord,</HI> to whom <HI>Miracles</HI> are <HI>natural,</HI> and by whom <HI>impossibilities</HI> are done with <HI>ease.</HI> 'Tis He that brought thee out of the Land of Egypt. And therefore,</P>
<P>The <HI>Duty</HI> in proportion must be su|perlatively<NOTE PLACE="marg">IV.</NOTE> <HI>great</HI> too, however hid in this place by a little <HI>Meiosis</HI> of expres|sion. <HI>Beware that thou forget not</HI> the Lord thy God; that is, <HI>Remember what he hath done,</HI> and <HI>thank</HI> him for it by thy <HI>obedience;</HI> Let thy <HI>gratitude</HI> be <HI>seen</HI> in
<PB N="7" REF="6">
thy <HI>conversation.</HI> Be sure to <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Deut. 10. 12</NOTE> <HI>love</HI> him and to <HI>serve</HI> him, with <HI>all</HI> thy <HI>heart</HI> and with <HI>all</HI> thy soul. <HI>Forget</HI> him if thou <HI>canst,</HI> unless thou canst forget thou wert <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Deut. 6. 20, 21.</NOTE> <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s <HI>Bondman.</HI> Nay <HI>forget</HI> him if thou <HI>dar'st,</HI> unless thou art so <HI>stout</HI> that thou dar'st be <HI>damn'd.</HI> And yet <HI>be|ware</HI> lest thou forget him, whilest thou art <HI>swimming</HI> in <HI>prosperity,</HI> the <HI>stream</HI> of which may either <HI>drown</HI> thee, or make thee <HI>drunk,</HI> if thou art not <HI>fore|arm'd</HI> with <HI>circumspection.</HI> And there|fore <HI>beware</HI> that thou forget not the Lord that brought thee out of Egypt. And that thou mayst <HI>not forget</HI> him, write the Favours which he hath done thee <HI>upon the posts of thine House,</HI> and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 6. 7, 8, 9.</NOTE> place them <HI>as Frontlets between thine eyes;</HI> tell them out unto thy <HI>children, as thou walkest by the way,</HI> at thy <HI>lying down,</HI> and thy <HI>rising up;</HI> Let them be as a <HI>Signet upon thine Arm,</HI> and as a <HI>Seal upon thine Heart.</HI> That the <HI>pleasures</HI> of thy <HI>Deliverance</HI> may not make thee <HI>forgetful</HI> of thy <HI>Deliverer,</HI> (forgetful of the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Deut. 32. 15, 18.</NOTE> <HI>Rock out of which thou wert hewn,</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="7">
and <HI>kicking</HI> (like <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Deut. 32. 15, 18.</NOTE> <HI>Iesurun) at him that made thee,</HI>) keep an <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Exod. 13. 3, 4, 10, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>Anniversary Feast,</HI> (a standing <HI>Passeover</HI> in <HI>May,</HI>) whereby to <HI>fix</HI> him in thy <HI>Remembrance.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly a <HI>Duty</HI> so <HI>indispensable</HI> should<NOTE PLACE="marg">V.</NOTE> be inforc't upon the soul by the <HI>present season.</HI> A season of <HI>peace</HI> and <HI>prosperity,</HI> succeeding a <HI>season of Persecution.</HI> The greatest <HI>incitement</HI> to the <HI>Duty</HI> should be the manifold <HI>enjoyment</HI> of this Delive|rance. For so 'tis obvious to infer from the particle THEN, (so strongly <HI>implied</HI> in the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> that in the <HI>Eng|lish</HI> 'tis well <HI>express'd,</HI>) upon which there seems to lye the chiefest <HI>emphasis</HI> of the Text, if we observe how it stands in a <HI>double Relation</HI> to the <HI>Context.</HI> [When the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the Land, to give thee great and goodly Cities, and houses full of all good things; when thou shalt have eaten and be full, THEN beware that thou forget not the Lord that brought thee out of Egypt.]</P>
<P>The Text is so <HI>fruitful</HI> of particulars, and each particular is so apt to administer
<PB N="9" REF="7">
<HI>matter</HI> of <HI>Discourse,</HI> that it hath really been my hardest Question, whereabouts I should <HI>begin,</HI> and how I should <HI>end</HI> my me|ditations. And after too much time lost in stating the Question within my self, I have thought it at once the <HI>fittest</HI> and the most <HI>useful</HI> to be resolv'd, as most immediately complying with the <HI>solem|nity</HI> of the <HI>time,</HI> not to yield to the temptation of comparing <HI>our</HI> Land with the land of <HI>Egypt,</HI> for fear of seem|ing to have a pique at the <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>In|dempnity</HI> and <HI>Oblivion;</HI> (otherwise 'twere easie to make a Parallel, because however our <HI>native Countrey,</HI> yet for twelve years together it was a very <HI>strange Land;</HI>) But not advancing one step beyond the Threshold, I shall be|stow my whole time upon the little word THEN; as being a <HI>particle</HI> of <HI>connexion</HI> betwixt our <HI>Duty</HI> and our <HI>De|liverance,</HI> betwixt the <HI>business</HI> of the Time and the <HI>time</HI> it self; betwixt the <HI>occasion</HI> and the <HI>end</HI> of our present meet|ing: looking like <HI>Homer</HI>'s wise man, <GAP DESC="foreign">, with a visible <HI>prospect</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="8">
on all that <HI>follows,</HI> and with as visible a <HI>retrospect</HI> upon the words going <HI>before.</HI></P>
<P>When Prosperity breaks in like a <HI>mighty stream,</HI> (in so much that I may say<NOTE PLACE="marg">Amos 5. 24.</NOTE> with our blessed Saviour, <HI>This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears,) Then</HI> be|ware<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 4. 21.</NOTE> that you forget not the Lord that brought you out of Egypt. Beware you forget him not at <HI>any</HI> time, but espe|cially at <HI>this.</HI> For the particle <HI>Then</HI> is an important Monosyllable; and that especially in <HI>three</HI> respects.</P>
<P>First because of the <HI>difficulty</HI> of ha|ving God in our Remembrance, much more <HI>Then,</HI> than at <HI>other times.</HI> Next for the <HI>dignity</HI> of the Duty, rather <HI>Then,</HI> than <HI>before</HI> or <HI>after.</HI> Lastly by reason of the <HI>danger</HI> of not performing the Du|ty <HI>Then,</HI> when it becomes incumbent on us by many <HI>unspeakable obligations.</HI></P>
<P>These especially are the <HI>Reasons</HI> of the particle <HI>Then</HI> in this place, on which <HI>alone</HI> I shall insist in this morning's Service. For should I adventure upon the rest, not on|ly the <HI>hour,</HI> but (for ought I can conje|cture) the <HI>day</HI> would fail me.</P>

rance (which are <HI>peace,</HI> and <HI>plenty,</HI> living <HI>securely,</HI> and at <HI>ease,</HI>) are apt to make us turn <HI>Atheists,</HI> provoking the <HI>Author</HI> of our Deliverance to correct us once more in the <HI>house of Bondage;</HI> appears, as by many other reasons, so particularly by <HI>this;</HI> that it is hard for us to <HI>prosper,</HI> and not to lye <HI>snoring</HI> in our prosperi|ties. For 'tis the <HI>natural language</HI> of a <HI>prosperous man,</HI> (as our Saviour implies by way of <HI>Parable,) Soul take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry, for thou hast much goods laid up for many years,</HI> (Luk. 12. 19.) And therefore <HI>Agur</HI>'s <HI>wisdome</HI> was never more seen, then in his <HI>prayer; Give me not Riches, lest I be full, and de|ny thee, lest I say, who is the Lord?</HI> (Prov. 30. 8, 9.) He knew by manifold expe|rience, that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Jam. 4. 4.</NOTE> <HI>the friendship of the world is perfect enmity with God,</HI> and tends im|mediately to <HI>practical,</HI> if not to <HI>specu|lative</HI> Atheism.

not Riches, lest I be full and deny thee, lest I say in my heart, who is the Lord?</HI> that is, for fear I turn <HI>Atheist,</HI> and only <HI>sacrifice</HI> to my <HI>flesh.</HI> So also <HI>Solomon,</HI> when he was <HI>wisest,</HI> that is to say, when he <HI>repented,</HI> and of a very <HI>vicious Prince</HI> became a <HI>Preacher of Repentance,</HI> conclu|ded <HI>all under the Sun</HI> to be but <HI>vanity of vanities;</HI> as having found by all his trials (who sure had made more trials then ever any man did,) that <HI>peace</HI> and <HI>plenty</HI> with their two daughters, which are <HI>idleness,</HI> and <HI>ease,</HI> are exceedingly <HI>great,</HI> though <HI>glorious</HI> dangers.</P>
<P>But we need not go further for an <HI>in|stance,</HI> then to the people in my <HI>Text,</HI> whom though God might have called a very <HI>wild Tamarisk,</HI> he was pleased to stile his <HI>Beloved Vine.</HI> Lord! how carefully it was <HI>manur'd</HI> with <HI>Rain</HI> and <HI>Sun-shine?</HI> with <HI>Quailes,</HI> and <HI>Manna,</HI> and <HI>water</HI> squeez'd out of a <HI>Rock?</HI> with the <HI>Dew of heaven,</HI> and with the <HI>Fatness of the earth?</HI> and yet when all was done that <HI>could</HI> be, they either brought forth <HI>no</HI> Grapes; or if they did, they were commonly

<HI>wild</HI> ones.

And if in stead of being <HI>thankful</HI> for all the blessings we now enjoy, more espe|cially for <HI>that</HI> which we this day ce|lebrate, we shall but <HI>turn</HI> them into <HI>wantonness,</HI> and grow the <HI>worse</HI> for the <HI>effects</HI> of so great a <HI>goodness;</HI> what can we reasonably expect, but that the <HI>powers of Hell,</HI> should once again be <HI>let loose</HI> upon <HI>us</HI> and <HI>ours?</HI> For since to <HI>continue</HI> in our impieties, is the greatest <HI>dishonouring</HI> of God that can be; a <HI>fil|ling up</HI> the <HI>measure of our iniquities,</HI> and so the <HI>vials</HI> of his <HI>wrath;</HI> He <HI>must</HI> de stroy us <HI>se defendendo;</HI> if for nothing but to <HI>defend,</HI> and <HI>secure</HI> his Glory.</P>

<HI>the Cup of Salvation,</HI> (that is) <HI>the Cup of Thanks giving</HI> unto the <HI>Author</HI> of our salvation, all our <HI>calling upon his Name</HI> will be quite <HI>in vain:</HI> For <HI>when we spreadout our hands, he will hide his eyes,</HI> and when we make many prayers he will <HI>not hear</HI> (Isa. 1. 15.) And then to <HI>thank</HI> him as he <HI>requires,</HI> is not only to en|tertain him with <HI>Eucharistical words,</HI> with the meer <HI>Calves of our lips,</HI> or a <HI>Doxologie</HI> from the <HI>teeth outwards;</HI> but to <HI>imitate,</HI> and <HI>obey</HI> him, and to <HI>love</HI> him after the <HI>rate</HI> of his <HI>favour</HI> towards us; that we may not forfeit all our interest in the <HI>temporal salvation</HI> we this day celebrate, nor bring a <HI>reproach</HI> on the <HI>Author</HI> of it for saving a people so ill deserving; we must add to our <HI>verbal,</HI> our <HI>vital</HI> Prayers; nor only keep an <HI>annual Day,</HI> but even an <HI>age</HI> of <HI>thanks|giving</HI> for our <HI>Deliverance.</HI></P>
