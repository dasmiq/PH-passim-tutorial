<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT <HI>honourable, Robert Devorax Earle</HI> of Essex and Ewe, Vicount of Hereforde, Lord <HI>Ferrer of Chartley, Borcher, and Lovaine, Ma|ster</HI> of the Queenes Maiesties Horse, Knight <HI>of the noble order of the Garter, and one of</HI> her Maiesties most Honourable privie Councell.</HEAD>
<P>_IT is easie to gesse (honourable Lorde) why Schollars flocke under the patro|nage of men in your place; their condi|tion is so weake, that unlesse men truly honourable doe defend them, they are most of all in this age distressed. And yet (braue noble Lorde) ingeniously to confesse my true meaning) it is not that which mooued me at this time; but it is the height of admiration which my thoughts concei|ued of your honours worth, that made me thinke all men bound to offer signes of loue and dutie, where both are deserued in so high a measure I take vpon me <HI>Englands</HI> person and speake like a Common-wealth. And therfore howsoeuer it were presumption in me to dedicate papers of so small moment, to a personage of so rare worth, yet (honourable Lorde) take them as your cuntries talke, vouchsafe to reade them stamped with her name, and so all shall be afraide to mislike them, beeing graced with yours. And yet I weigh not whether others mislike them or no; let but your honour for learnings sake (a thing which I know you doe) say you are content to accept of the meanest trifle, and grace it with a good looke, and
<PB REF="3">
then I contemne what male-contented melancholy can speake against me. Your honour (be it spoken without envie) like Englands Cedar is sprung up to preserue with your shadowe, the humblest in all professions, from ha|treds malice. The warlike and braue soldier thinkes him selfe (and that in truth is) graced, to be tearmed but your follower. The worthy and kinde passionate Courtier deemes (and worthily) this his honour, to be your fauo|rite. The sober and devout student, that dispised doeth walke melancholy, takes himselfe (and not without cause) fortunate to be tearmed your schollar. Thus all relye no|ble Lord, upon your favour. And I (who though I must needs honour) yet usually with so deepe affection am not devoted without cause) doe so in kindnesse and loue (if that be not a word too presumptuous) passe over the full interest of my selfe to your dispose, as in what kinde soe|uer a schollar may doe his dutie, I am readie and desirous to be commanded by you: then accept (noble lorde) the willing mind of him that hath nothing else: and say, that that alone, is absolutely sufficient to content you. Read it, but (or if that be to much) doe but accept it, and so rest. where of not doubting in the middest of so many signes of a schollar-respecting honour, in dutie I kisse my hand, and humbly take my leaue.</P>

<HEAD>The Preface to the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>_WEe are fallen into the barren age of the worlde (courteous <HI>Reader</HI>) wherein though some fewe trauaile to expell Barbarisme, (which fortu|nately they haue done in our English tongue) yet a number of idle conceited-wise-foolish heades take vpon them peremptorily to censure other<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cause why many write not. Ignorance sits idle and will iudge. In vaine doe we complain of multitude of bookes.</NOTE> mens paines: so that euery man is loath to enter into the viewe whilst Idlenes shall stand controlling and giue her sentence. I know it could fit these to write, but that <HI>magni laboris est quem plerique fugimus. Homer</HI> wrote of the trauailes of the wor|thie Graecian <HI>Vlysses; Curtius</HI> of <HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Darius; Rome</HI> had neuer beene so renowmed but for <HI>Titus Livius; Thucydides</HI> eternized <HI>Iason</HI> and <HI>Minotaure;</HI> and sweet <HI>Salust Iugurth</HI> and <HI>Cateline:</HI> nay this wise age, long since had beene plaine foolish, if our painefull forefathers had not trauailed for their good. And if any man thinke this age is too wisely learned to read any thing which is but some fewe droppes of that mayne Ocean which ouerflowed in their daies, let him knowe this, that care added to their industrious trauailes, is easily able to perform matters of great importance. Learning was let loose ouer all <HI>Europe</HI> euer since <HI>Athens</HI> did first flourish (excepting a fevve yeares when the <HI>Gothes</HI> and <HI>Vandalls</HI> compelled her to liue in exile) who flying fast from their furie left <HI>Italie</HI> and those famous places, and planted her selfe so firmely in these poore countreies, that euer since amongst vs shee hath liued honourably. Thus in the abundance of our knowledge, he that hath taken pains, stands at the courtesie of euery paltrie fellowe to be censured as it please him. In consideration whereof, wise men haue deemed it the sa|fest, secretly to smile, and soberly to say nothing. For my paines I much care not, I esteeme thee (Reader) as thou dost me, for (dege|nerous<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vales. Zanch. <HI>N. D. B.</HI> Gallici</NOTE> minds intreated, grow insolent:) the daies are euill, and the argument is fit for these times; I knowe diuers haue trauai|led in the same kinde, whome I but humble (without wronging them) to speake vnto thy capacitie: Nobilitie fully learned made<NOTE PLACE="marg">My L.

choice to handle the same argument, and with such profounde deepe skill performde it, as that truth taketh her selfe much bound vnto him, who made her to speake eloquently that vseth to be plaine, and false prophesies ashamed, who so long haue vsurped truths titles. From hence maist thou learne (or at least remember) that the greatest Monarches (howsoeuer proud in their owne strength) must either fall with an enemies stroake, or (as <HI>Rome</HI> did) with her owne waight: here maist thou see that nothing is so made, but subiect to great change. And yet least thou desire to knowe what thou oughtest not, I haue laboured to make knowne what thou shouldest desire: my leisure will not serue to detaine thee long, and a short preface is beseeming so small paines. I take my leaue, and (if thou hast deserued) I giue thee thanks: onely this I must adde further (not to accuse others, or make an Apologie for my selfe) that I neuer yet in the least syllable of the so tearmed loosest line, meant either to modestie, pietie, chastitie, time, the Muses, or kindnes to doe wrong; neither should the surmised obiect of my muses song, or the dearest which that obiect hath, suspect in me but the least shadow of supposed eniurie: for I neither ment to make loose poetrie a true historie, or thought that wise courtesie would be so suspicious to misdeeme him, whose thoughts long since were deuoted to grauer studies: from whence taking leisure but to pause a little, my penne grewe passionate, and my idle papers scattered vnawares flew abroad (I protest) not to offend any: thus I binde thee (by that credit which truth deserues) whosoeuer thou art which reads, to beleeue what I haue spoken herein, and (if thou please) for my sake to accept<NOTE PLACE="marg">For such a Coxcombe.</NOTE> this. And because euery <HI>Balductum</HI> makes diuine poetrie to be but baserime, I leaue thee (sacred eloquence) to be defended by the Muses ornaments, and such (despised) to liue tormented with endles pouertie. <HI>Farewell.</HI></P>

<HEAD>POLIMANTEIA.</HEAD>
<P>_BEfore we come parti|cularlie to speake of <HI>Diuinations</HI> lawfull &amp; vnlawful; for the true and better vnderstan|ding of them, we will first define, what Diuination is: <HI>Diuina|tion</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">What Diui|nation is.</NOTE> <HI>is a foretelling of things to come, perfor|ming it in diuers manners, as well artificial|ly, as naturally.</HI> But those that more cu|riously subtilize vpon the Etymologie, say, that to diuine is properly to fore|tell, and to foresee things to come, by an exteriour motion, without hauing any subiect, cause, or signe before hand<NOTE PLACE="marg">God alone absolutely knoweth things to come.</NOTE> to coniecture so; and therefore in this sort, God testifieth of himselfe, that he alone knoweth things to come, which afterward he reueiled by his Prophets
<PB REF="7">
and Apostles, as it pleased him. Now Satan desiring in this to bee Gods Ape,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Satan Gods</NOTE> (thereby the better to abuse the world, &amp; to drowne men in intolerable super|stition, by a naturall curiositie to know things to come) hath iniuriouslie and falselie vsurped the same authoritie to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Satan false|ly a Diuiner.</NOTE> diuine, and from the~ce proceedeth the word <HI>Diuination:</HI> so that thereby Satan so much the more vnder a cloak of na|turall things, is for the most part as a forger and cou~terfeiter (excepting the diuination whereupon the subiect of this matter depends:) and therefore it is necessarie to trie and examine in the first place, the might, subtiltie and craft of the diuell; in whom we shall finde as great knowledge and vnderstanding,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The power of Satan.</NOTE> (excepting the Angels) as in all the o|ther creatures besides; wee shall finde as great subtiltie for interpreting the signes of diuers things: a matchles vigi|lancie: an incomparable cunning, to inuent trumperies; and deceit, vnder fine coloured, but false pretences: And
<PB REF="7">
to conclude, a most perfect malice ac|companied with a perpetuall hate a|gainst<NOTE PLACE="marg">Satan a per|petuall ene|mie to man|kinde.</NOTE> mankinde: and the rather, seeing that it is not in his force, to doe any thing of himselfe: to hinder the course of things naturall ordained by God: to destroy and to make againe: to sound the depth of mans heart: or to foresee how God gouerneth the course of the world: the affayres of Kings and Prin|ces before the reuelation of his diuine prophesies. Notwithstanding he per|ceiueth by his subtiltie the hid proper|ties of things bodily and spirituall. His knowledge is exceeding by his mani|fold experience of things past: he di|ueth so farre as may possibly bee soun|ded into mens maners; and copies out their actions, from whence he deriueth his greatest profit. Thus he incombers the actions of Kings &amp; Princes of each in particular; that contrarie to all rea|son and opinion of men, they are all so intermedlingly inwrapped each in o|ther states, that scarse anie knoweth
<PB REF="8">
how to escape himselfe. Thorough the deepe whereof he so lancheth without sight, that he maketh one of them to entrap and beguile another: whereof euerie where are examples sufficient, and therefore S. <HI>Paul</HI> to the Ephesians setteth downe most liuely Satans puis|sance. But let vs see a little neerer the diuels policie, of what force &amp; efficacie it is, especially in those things which concerne the ruines of Gouernment, or change of a Common wealth. First then, although that the diuell knoweth not the state and affayres of Kings and Princes in particular, as God from the beginning hath predestinated them in his immutable counsel, nor how he wil dispose and change them contrarie to the opinion of men &amp; ordinarie course of things natural; yet notwithstanding the knowledge which men by the per|mission of almightie God, haue drawn<NOTE PLACE="marg">Man infe|riour in knowledge to Satan.</NOTE> out of the diuine prophesies of ancient time, is not comparable to that of Sa|tan, by reason he farre surpasseth man,
<PB REF="8">
in fine, quick &amp; nimble subtiltie, which he vseth to his owne aduantage. These<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spirits.</NOTE> know by the predictions of Prophets: that such Kings and Princes shall come to gouerne: besides, by what meanes<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> they shall attaine it, and by whom God will giue the Scepter into their hands: besides, when and how it shall be taken from them. And in one word, Satan<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foretold.</NOTE> knoweth the estate of Gouernment which must happen, and how long it shal endure, and the enemies which shal rise vp for the ruine of it. From these &amp; such like reuelations would they drawe their diuinations. They haue found out by the prophesies of <HI>Daniel</HI> the estate &amp; chaunge of Monarchies which must happen, the ruine of <HI>Darius,</HI> the destru|ction of <HI>Asia:</HI> and that the Monarchie of <HI>Babylon</HI> shall be transported to the <HI>Greekes:</HI> By meanes whereof, when <HI>A|lexander</HI> the Great consulted with the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oracles.</NOTE> Oracle at <HI>Delphos, Pythias</HI> answered him, <HI>Eris inuictus Alexander:</HI> Thou shalt be vnconquered <HI>Alexander.</HI> And after|ward
<PB REF="9">
for confirming, and giuing credit to his Oracle, hee ceased not to shewe<NOTE PLACE="marg">Satans sub|tiltie.</NOTE> signes &amp; wonders together with vaine illusions, in the behalfe of <HI>Alexander,</HI> which way soeuer he marched with his armie: on the contrarie not to daunt <HI>Darius</HI> too much, he nourisht in him a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Satan an Ambidex|ter.</NOTE> vaine hope by doubtfull dreames, per|swading him fondly of victorie, against his enemie. For the temptations of Sa|tan are of that sort, that they promise vs all ioy and happines whatsoeuer: but no sooner they are entertained of vs, but in their place commeth despayre, with a perpetuall torment. By the pro|phesie of <HI>Daniel</HI> and <HI>Esai,</HI> the diuell<NOTE PLACE="marg">Satan know|eth the scrip|ture.</NOTE> knewe that the Monarchie of the <HI>Assy|rians</HI> should be wholly desolate and gi|uen into the power of the <HI>Medes</HI> and <HI>Persians,</HI> and that al this should be done by <HI>Cyrus.</HI> For this cause it was foretold, that King <HI>Croesus</HI> should be chased and spoyled of the kingdome of <HI>Lydia:</HI> And therefore knowing the might of King <HI>Cyrus,</HI> Satan ceased not to moue and in|cite
<PB REF="9">
<HI>Croesus</HI> by a bayte of ambition, to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Croesus con|quered.</NOTE> oppose himselfe against the <HI>Persian Cy|rus.</HI> This being done, the <HI>Assyrians</HI> Em|pyre was spoyled, <HI>Croesus</HI> conquered, and the Monarchie translated to <HI>Cyrus.</HI></P>
<P>There is one especiall example farre surpassing all that antiquitie mentio|neth of Satans subtiltie, whereby appa|rantly he shewed the intent and effect of his whole treacherie: It was that of the great contemplatiue diuine <HI>Iam|blicke,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iamblich.</NOTE> who desirous to knowe the name of him that should in the Empyre suc|ceede the Emperour <HI>Ualens</HI> that then raigned, he made trial of it by a certain<NOTE PLACE="marg">A thing vn|lawfull.</NOTE> foolish (be it spoken with reuerence to so wise a man) and most vnlearned di|uination in this manner: He caused the Greeke Alphabet written to bee put by distinct letters, in the ground, and vpon euery one he placed a graine of Barley;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A foolish proofe.</NOTE> in the midst a Cock, &amp; the letters where the Cocke scraped the Barley, should signifie the thing he so much desired. Now it happened that the Cock bared
<PB REF="10">
these foure letters: <GAP DESC="foreign"> yet now like|wise<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> he remained vncertain of the name which these letters should portend, to discerne whether it were <HI>Theodosius,</HI> or <HI>Theodotus, Theodorus,</HI> or <HI>Theodectes.</HI> The Emperour <HI>Ualens</HI> seeing the euent of all this, &amp; fearing some false play, made<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diuination will beget Tyrannie.</NOTE> <HI>(Herod</HI> like) all such to be put to death, as those letters did poynt out. He com|maunded likewise, to search foorth the <HI>Diuine. Iamblicke,</HI> fearing the crueltie of the Emperour, by reason of the fault which he had committed, (for it was not<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vnmeete it should be.</NOTE> lawfull in <HI>Rome</HI> to enquire into the suc|cession of the Empyre during the life of the Emperour) poysoned himselfe. But we shall finde for the most part that the diuell the more to delude men by<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doubtfull answers ar|gue deceite, or ignorance.</NOTE> these diuinations, gaue his answers hid, darke, double, and doubtful, especiallie when himselfe (which often happened) was vncertaine of the euent, being on|ly led by suspicious and sleight conie|ctures, without euidence of diuine re|uelation, (as appeared by the doubt of
<PB REF="10">
that name which those foure letters might portend:) for not knowing the trueth, he talketh by circumstances and darke signes, sometimes telling the trueth to gaine credit to his false lyes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Caueat.</NOTE> seeing by a malicious instinct he stri|ueth to obscure the trueth, to the great dammage of mortall men. For his de|light is in falshood, and his ioy is in our fall. That is the reason why hee vseth these doubtfull &amp; vncertaine answers, to the intent to abuse men by his ridi|culous apish mockeries, and finally to bring them by a certaine feare, and a sorrow of things to come, to most abo|minable wickednesse, in executing the self same euil, which before he had told vnto him, that inquired of it.</P>
<P>We haue a most famous example and worth the marking, of an Oracle (in re|spect of their doubtfull answers) which was found in <HI>Greece</HI> vnder the shadowe<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambiguitie in oracles.</NOTE> of the word <GAP DESC="foreign">, which signifieth both <HI>man</HI> and <HI>light,</HI> if the accent be not right|ly<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">, man, light.</NOTE> placed (for the ancient Greekes were
<PB REF="11">
not careful in this, as it is well noted by <HI>Iustus Lypsius:</HI>) then the doubt of the foresayd Oracle, by reason of the am|biguitie of the word, made them vncer|taine whether their sacrifice should be of humane flesh or some other thing; euen so now we see oftentimes that he hath told the euent of things, whereof he is the author: yet notwithstanding for al that, because God hath admirable meanes in his counsell for to gouerne all that is in the world, and because Sa|tan is ignorant of the euent or chaunge<NOTE PLACE="marg">God dispro|ueth his so|phistrie.</NOTE> of things disposed by GOD himselfe, (whether it bee a punishment or a re|lease of his rigor, which he vseth some|times in the execution of his iustice) he vttereth his diuinations &amp; predictions in obscure manner, ballanced with an equal, yet difficult interpretatio~, which may as well agree to this as to that, not only for the doubtfull sense, but for the double reading of it. Of this kind was this: <HI>Croesus Halym penetrans magna~ per|uertit opum vim.</HI> Likewise the fraudu|lent
<PB REF="11">
example of the answere which the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pope Bor|gias.</NOTE> diuel gaue vnto Pope <HI>Borgias</HI> of eleuen yeares and eight moneths, may serue to confirme this. Furthermore, the di|uell not only knoweth by diuine pro|phesies<NOTE PLACE="marg">Satan cun|ning in di|uine prophe|sies.</NOTE> the subuersions, ruines, and re|stroings of Monarchies, but he intru|deth himselfe often into the handling of them, &amp; entermedleth in the counsel of Kings and Princes, enforcing them<NOTE PLACE="marg">A states ma~.</NOTE> by all means possible to bring in a con|fusion: to trouble the estate: to oppose themselues one against another: to dis|perse Realmes: to debase lawes ten|ding to the good gouernment of the Common wealth. He is alwayes ham|mering of some newes, daily to hinder good and sound counsell, and in stead<NOTE PLACE="marg">The author of ill lawes.</NOTE> of them to set abroach other, fatall to the Church and the Common wealth: he enflameth the hearts of the mightie, with an ambitious desire of ruling, to this end, he perswades them to followe bad counsell, seruing for the execution of their dissignments: Such as these are<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ieroboam.</NOTE>
<PB REF="12">
plentifull in the holie scripture. Thus he moued the <HI>Chaldeans</HI> to come to rob and spoyle <HI>Iob</HI> of his riches, and to sley<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob. 1. 17.</NOTE> his seruants. Thus he plotted like an ancie~t states man, to hinder the rebuil|ding of the Temple of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> after the returne from <HI>Babylon,</HI> perswading<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> king <HI>Cambyses,</HI> by meanes of the Courts flatterers, to make warre against the <HI>Ae|gyptians,</HI> which hee did: And for feare lest the <HI>Iewes</HI> should enter into alliance<NOTE PLACE="marg">Satan vseth great men sometimes for his turne.</NOTE> with them of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> the king comman|ded in plain termes, to hinder the work of the Temple which was then begun: and thus Satan compassed his intended scope. When he asked leaue to enter into the heard of swine, hee had more craft then a common politicke: He did<NOTE PLACE="marg">A foreseeing Polititian.</NOTE> the <HI>Gaderens</HI> a displeasure in their reli|gion, by that meanes, foreseeing they would entreat Christ to go out of their kingdome, and so runne headlong with their swine, into eternall destruction. Againe, he stood at the right side of the Sacrificer in <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> to hinder that
<PB REF="12">
no good thing might bee done in that citie. Hee attacheth (as it were) with a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rather them then others to make the~ hurt by ex|ample.</NOTE> contagious infection the most part of publique persons, the better by that meanes to obtaine his purpose, by rea|son of the charge which they sustaine for to preserue others. Then seeing that Satan intermingleth himself in the midst of affayres publique, and that by a diuine permission, he insnareth both<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. King. 22.</NOTE> one, and other, ayming continual|ly to subuert the state, (especiallie of Monarches) knowing besides, that their ruine and change shall happen, it is no meruaile that hee oftentimes foresees the euents whereof he is the cause, and afterward forgeth <HI>Diuinations,</HI> to the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Satan buz|zeth into mens hearts that which he hath plot|ted himselfe.</NOTE> intent to deceiue both one and other. But although that God oftentimes per|mit Satan (by reason of our demerits) to exercise his tyrannie ouer the princi|pall states of the world, yet notwith|standing, that permission is not infinite; for God keepeth, gardeth, and defen|deth Realmes, to the intent that being

For if wee would but consider the matter a little further, we shall finde by the scripture in the time of <HI>Noah,</HI> af|ter the building of the tower of <HI>Baby|lon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 10 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> that <HI>Nimrod</HI> was elected by diuine prouidence, to guide and gouerne the people then, when as the children, ne|phewes, and linage of <HI>Noah,</HI> wandered without townes to dwell in, destitute of cities, or houses, liuing by hunting and vpon the fruites of the earth, without a|ny tillage, who then represented a ma|iestie, force and valour in his person; by reason wherof the holie scripture saith, that hee was <HI>Robustus venator Domini,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 10. 9.</NOTE> <HI>aut, Coram Domino,</HI> a strong hunter of the Lord, by reason of the might and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Or as some say, tyra~nize ouer men.</NOTE> puissance that hee had to tame the sa|uage and wild beasts: Whereby we may well conclude, that Common wealths had their beginnings by violent Ty|rannies, &amp; that <HI>Nimrod</HI> by force &amp; vio|lence obtained the soueraigntie. Not|withsta~ding we find in scripture, that he
<PB REF="14">
was a most heroicall King and no Ty|rant: (howsoeuer some doe intend o|therwise)<NOTE PLACE="marg">A monarchy easily a ty|ranny.</NOTE> because that by his meanes was established the forme of a Com|mon wealth, most durable to gouerne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His begin|ning.</NOTE> and to keepe the people in order and discipline. And so from this first diuine wisedome, humane societie was kept v|nited from time to time. This likewise<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Prince Gods Vice|gerent.</NOTE> is the cause why the Prince is tearmed Gods Vicegerent vpon earth. Finally, he was garded with such force, that the Empyres (which wee call Monarchies) by this meanes were ordained: &amp; then of the selfe same Monarchies, (by rea|son<NOTE PLACE="marg">A thing vsuall.</NOTE> of an insatiable ambition and de|sire to rule) proceeded Tyrannies. But although that Tyrants, by the permis|sion of God, seemed sometimes (by rea|son of their horrible murders and de|structions) to bee willing to cancell all law, and peruert all iustice, that tended to the maintenance of a Common|wealth, and whereby Empyres flouri|shed: yet notwithstanding wee finde by
<PB REF="14">
the discourse of histories, that the verie Tyrants themselues, by a diuine proui|dence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tyrants haue often had a care of good lawes.</NOTE> haue oftentimes left behinde the~ good lawes, as the true markes of Iu|stice, tending to the maintenance and conseruation of kingdoms, to the inte~t that humane societie should not either be disperst, or raced out. God hath the meanes to vs vnknowne, to keep them from such wickednesses, that he turneth the euil of present ruling Tyrants, vnto the especiall good of gouerning poste|ritie: for his will is the perfect rule and the infallible direction of all right and equitie. By reason whereof some are of that mind, that although the Empyre of the <HI>Turkes,</HI> in dignitie and greatnes<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Turke no Monarch.</NOTE> exceeded the foure Monarchs of the worlde, yet notwithstanding it could not bee reputed for a true Monarchie, because that amongst those barbarous people, there was neither humanitie nor forme, or shewe of iustice, but a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Without Iustice no Monarchie.</NOTE> meere deuastation of Empyres, and a reall destruction of all lawes and poli|cies;
<PB REF="15">
which were established and drea|mingly obserued of other Monarchies, vnder whom (notwithstanding their enormities) God had continually pre|serued miraculously a forme of iustice, to the intent to preserue his owne peo|ple. I will onely alleadge two examples (not to bee too troublesome) without touch or mention of the Romane lawes afterward brought in, to shew by them the equitie and iustice, which Tyrants and Infidels themselues haue somtimes in the gouernment of their Common|wealths vsed, as well in regard of their<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iustice som|times a|mongst Ty|rants.</NOTE> ciuill and politicke order, as Militarie. The one long since famous, is the ex|ample of the execution of iustice in King <HI>Cambyses</HI> (otherwise a great Ty|rant) which he executed vpo~ the Iudge<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cambyses. Herodotus lib. 1.</NOTE> corrupted with bribes in the person of <HI>Sysannes,</HI> who after he was put to death he was fleyed, and his skinne hung ouer the Iudgement seate, where his sonne was commanded to sit as Iudge, that in iudging he might reme~ber the offence
<PB REF="15">
of his father. The other, is the famous<NOTE PLACE="marg">Anaxilaus.</NOTE> and memorable example of <HI>Anaxilaus,</HI> whom the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> vsed thus: He seeing that in the time of the siege of the citie <HI>Byzance, Clearchus</HI> the Go|uernour bega~ to take the goods of the Burgesses, that dyed for famine, to di|uide amongst his Souldiers, to the in|tent to hold the towne longer, he dealt in the absence of <HI>Clearchus</HI> with the ene|mie, to yeeld vp the towne vpon good conditions, which soone yeelded with|out pillage or shedding of bloud. Af|terward <HI>Anaxilaus</HI> was accused to the~ of <HI>Sparta</HI> for rendring the towne, who (vsing a most honest excuse) answered, that they ought to make warre against the enemie and not their owne selues, and that it was a thing most vniust to handle the Burgesses more rudely then the enemie. And for these excuses full of reason they absolued him. This ex|ample may serue at this day sometimes to excuse publique persons, who~ some<NOTE PLACE="marg">But not to excuse trea|son.</NOTE> indeuour to accuse and blame slande|rously,
<PB REF="16">
without discretion, not conside|ring that God miraculously gouerneth the heart of those whom God hath pla|ced to gouerne others, to the intent to hinder and preuent the totall ruine of his people and Common wealth; as we may reade of the Prophet <HI>Ieremiah,</HI> who gaue counsell to the King <HI>Zedechias,</HI> when he was besieged in <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> to yeeld himselfe to the <HI>Chaldeans,</HI> to the intent to preserue the people and the towne, notwithstanding many others perswaded the contrarie. Many such examples full of naturall equitie are largely handled by Saint <HI>Ambrose</HI> in the third booke of his Offices.

But for the true vnderstanding of it, let vs con|sider the testimonies and examples of holy Scripture, besides the meere con|iectures of heathen Philosophie.

<PB REF="19">
as may bee apparantly manifest, both by the examples alleadged be|fore, &amp; by many others here and there which may bee alleadged to that pur|pose. The reason of the difference in regarde of time, and the diuersitie of change which happeneth in them, is likewise grounded vpon the holy scrip|ture of Gods word: we haue saide be|fore, that GOD giueth the Scepter of realmes as it pleaseth him, and taketh them away as his pleasure is. Likewise<NOTE PLACE="marg">The change of Kingdoms not by cha~ce.</NOTE> the change of kingdomes happeneth not by chaunce, but by diuine proui|dence; by reason of the causes, which goe before the ruines of them, by meanes whereof, God so disposeth of Realmes and Empyres, that whomsoe|uer he hath installed for gouernement, are by him defended with might and authoritie, as the especiall gift of God, accompanied with many vertues re|quisite thereunto, namely wisdom, hap|pines, goodwill, iustice, clemencie, &amp;c. all which ioyntly sustaine the pillars of
<PB REF="20">
the Empyre: for it is written, <HI>Misericor|dia &amp; veritas custodiunt regem &amp; clemen|tia fulcitur thronus eius.</HI> In such sort that the Common wealths of Kings and Princes defended with this authoritie, are for a long time, flourishing and in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prosperous Kingdomes.</NOTE> most prosperous estate. On the contra|rie, if the Common wealth be gouer|ned by wicked kinges, vitious, or ty|rants, and that the subiects to the imita|tion of their Prince, are infected with the same faultes, and plunged so deepe, that they can no way get out; then au|thoritie failes, vertues are abandoned, and punishment doth ensew: hereup|on GOD hasteneth his iudgementes which preuent the reuolutions, and changes in that they had apparance to<NOTE PLACE="marg">The punish|ment of sinne is the change of the state.</NOTE> continew longer: he punisheth sinnes both of the Prince and people ordina|rily by the chaunge and ruine of the Common wealth: for being not bound to the periods of time, he disanulleth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">God not tyed to periods.</NOTE> changeth, and altereth their estates, as it pleaseth him.

<PB REF="21">
&amp; the difference of the degrees of ho|nor, and dignities; and that for vertue, although not for religion. But the cau|ses and occasions going before these chaunges, consist in the manners and actions of men, which all are not of the same sort, but exceeding diuers. And therefore the same author addeth and reproueth the former opinio~ that states are troubled by diuers meanes. I take it here not a thing impertinent (seeing the subiect of our matter) to stay a little and examine somewhat the opinion of some authors, which are willing to set down rules to iudge of the happenings for the euents and chaunges of Com|mon wealths. Amongst others <HI>Plato</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato. Celestial in|fluence.</NOTE> ascribeth not this either to a celestiall influence, nor to the motion of starres, but to the dissolution of <HI>Harmonie.</HI> This is his opinion, but wee finde at this day a great contrarietie amongst the late writers, for the true vnderstanding of <HI>Plato</HI> his mind, and chiefly of the word<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bodin. de Rep. lib. 4.</NOTE> <HI>Harmonie.</HI> Master <HI>Iohn Bodin</HI> is of that
<PB REF="21">
minde, that this <HI>Harmonie</HI> is to bee vn|derstood<NOTE PLACE="marg">Harmonie.</NOTE> of tunes &amp; melodious sounds. For the better interpretation whereof, and the more to confirme his opinion, in the fourth booke of his Politicks he hath made the forme of a Tria~gle with certaine numbers thereupon, to grou~d a musicall harmonie; and so apply it to <HI>Plato</HI> his opinion. Wherein he is repre|hended by Master <HI>Augier Ferrier</HI> Lord of <HI>Castillon,</HI> who making the distinction<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aequiuoca|tion in Har|monie.</NOTE> of the word <HI>Harmonie,</HI> to put away all equiuocatio~s, sayth, that the word <HI>Har|monie</HI> is a generall terme, applied to all things well beseeming: and to all good proportions: to all Common wealths well framed: to all families well orde|red, and generally to euery thing iustly and orderly disposed: of perfect mea|sure and of fine accorde. So the Phisi|tians call the best constitutions of bo|die. The Musitians take the word o|therwise, and referre it to tunes &amp; me|lodious soundes: and so <HI>Plato</HI> saying that Common wealths come to ruine
<PB REF="22">
when the harmonie faileth, that is to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato ex|pounded by M. Augier.</NOTE> say, when the policie, the lawes, the or|der, the vnion of the inhabitants is bro|ken, vseth the word in the first significa|tion: for it is then that a way is open to troubles &amp; seditions whatsoeuer. And speaking to Master <HI>Bodin,</HI> thinke you (sayth he) that <HI>Plato</HI> vnderstood that of tunes &amp; melodious sounds, which <HI>Pla|to</HI> neuer thought of concerning the change of Kingdomes and Common|wealths? And giuing another reason against the former interpretation, hee saith, that all proportion is not song, or melodie, although otherwise it bee a harmonie, for his good structure and equall figure: he alleadgeth onely this place for the defence of the true vnder|standing of that which <HI>Plato</HI> wrote, and of the word <HI>Harmonie:</HI> for concerning<NOTE PLACE="marg">Harmonie not the ground of Kingdomes.</NOTE> the maine poynt, <HI>Bodin</HI> himselfe is of that opinion, that changing or preser|uation of Common wealths, no way depends on the <HI>Harmonie</HI> of soundes. But a man ought more to feare it, when
<PB REF="22">
the citizens begin to stray from the na|turall<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fall of a citie is the breach of good lawes.</NOTE> harmonie of good lawes wel or|dered; and from manners rightly dis|posed, to lawes, customes, and maners vnlawfull, wicked, and pernicious: al|though he denyeth not that <HI>Harmonie</HI> of sounds hath a great force and effect to chaunge a Common wealth: for (sayth he) we haue a memorable exa~ple of the <HI>Cynethian</HI> Common wealth in<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cyne|thian commo~ wealth.</NOTE> <HI>Arcadia,</HI> which hauing forsake~ the plea|sure of Musicke, soone after fell to sedi|tions and ciuill warres, attributing the effect to <HI>Musicke,</HI> to appease and molli|fie<NOTE PLACE="marg">The effect of Musicke.</NOTE> a people so barbarous and sauage. By meanes whereof he confesseth that this causeth the naturall harmonie of well agreeing lawes, which causeth me~ to continue in good and perfect order, and thereupon followeth the preserua|tion of the Common wealth. It is verie likely that Musicke hath a great force to appease the minds of men, as diuers examples may giue vs witnesse, namely of <HI>Saul</HI> and <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> who as well be|fore<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pythagoras.</NOTE>
<PB REF="23">
as after his sleepe vsed a certaine <HI>Musicall</HI> and melodious <HI>Harmonie:</HI> And as <HI>Censorin</HI> speaketh, <HI>Vt animum sua sem|per diuinitate imbueret:</HI> To furnish the minde with the diuinitie of it. The same author sayth, that <HI>Asclepiades</HI> the Phisi|tian<NOTE PLACE="marg">Asclepiades.</NOTE> vsed ordinarily a musicall harmo|nie to call furious and phreneticall spi|rits to their own nature: and there upon is it common (sayth he) <HI>Ut legionibus in</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Musicke ex|pelleth the feare of dan|ger.</NOTE> <HI>acie dimicantibus metus mortis classico de|pellatur: &amp; in nauis metu vel vt facilius la|borem sufferant &agrave; vectore Symphonia ad|hibetur.</HI> Yet notwithstanding he teach|eth vs that Musicke at this day hath not the effect to withstand the sedition of our age, because she hath lost much of her ancie~t nimblenes, by reason where|of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Musick not so nimble as it hath beene.</NOTE> Musicke is not esteemed of all e|qually in generall. On the other side we may obserue the opinion of those who would iudge of the chaunge of King|domes, (although they are founded vpon a ground ruinous) as those who<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Horos|copy of cities bad rules to iudge by of chaunges.</NOTE> build vpon the <HI>Horoscopies</HI> of townes,

But me thinkes (as one<NOTE PLACE="marg">September not so fatall as Bodin wri|teth.</NOTE> well noteth) that this should giue too much credit to the moneth of Septem|ber, to the preiudice of the other, in that it hath force to change estates, and that these curiosities are not to bee ad|mitted of vs, but to bee referred rather

The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> (whose death can<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince of Orange.</NOTE> neuer be sufficiently lamented, nor the
<PB REF="25">
manner hated and abhorred) likewise<NOTE PLACE="marg">A hatefull proscription.</NOTE> dyed the same day of Iuly following, whose death was violent and practised by the Spanish treason in that manner, that neuer historie in respect of the proscription hath made mention of the like; vnlesse it be of Pyrats, Robbers by sea, and such, who (according to the lawes of nations) haue euer been ex|cluded from the benefit of faith, trueth, and loyaltie, and consequently from all saftie, for as <HI>Tullie</HI> writeth: <HI>Pyrata non est ex perduellium numero definitus, sed com|munis hostis omnium, alioqui ius etiam bel|licum fidesque iurisiurandi saepe cum hoste seruanda.</HI> For instance we haue the me|morable proscription of <HI>Crocotas</HI> the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crocotas.</NOTE> arch pyrat, of whom <HI>Augustus</HI> the Em|peror caused proclamation to be made by the sounde of his trumpet, that who|soeuer<NOTE PLACE="marg">A fact that for it the greatnes of Spaines fall cannot satis|fie the mea|sure of Gods wrath.</NOTE> would take him, should haue a hundred &amp; twentie thousand crownes. I onely alleadge this in respect of the most detestable murder of the worthie and vertuous Prince of <HI>Orange:</HI> not
<PB REF="25">
long after the death of these two great personages followed the fatall ruines of the Lowe Countrey. In one worde <HI>Catherine</HI> of <HI>Medices,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Guyse</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Katherine of Medices.</NOTE> his brother, the Cardinall, the King of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vnder pre|tence of con|fession to kill a Prince ne|uer heard of before.</NOTE> <HI>France</HI> last slayne by that false <HI>Iacobin,</HI> (a murther written in Tymes forhead, by the pen of aeternitie to astonish all posteritie) these all happened from De|cember to August: and therefore mee thinkes September hath small vertue to induce vs to respect it. But of all rules which I knowe worth the marking to iudge by of the falles of kingdomes, &amp; Common wealths, I finde none more renounced by Master <HI>Bodin,</HI> then the numbers of seuen and nine, and those which arise from the multiplication of these two, and the perfect number of 496. which first is obserued by him, and he saith the reason is, because of the in|finite wisdome of God, who hath so dis|posed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bodin.</NOTE> all things by number, that king|domes themselues after certaine yeres, haue ordinarilie come to ende, and that
<PB REF="26">
humane things fall not out by chance. I confesse indeede, concerning the criti|call dayes (whereof the seauenth day is called the King by <HI>Galen</HI>) that from the~ce are drawne strange meruailes of numbers, applyed to weekes, moneths, yeares, ages, worlds; and so to townes, Common wealths, and Kingdomes: whereunto all that may bee referred which we haue spoken before of the pe|riods of 500. of 250. of 700. yeares, al|though<NOTE PLACE="marg">Numbers no certaine grounds of vndoubted truth.</NOTE> I finde such contrarietie in the examples alleadged by Master <HI>Bodin,</HI> for the confirming of these numbers, that they are not firmly to be relied on, as vndoubtedly true. For to the inte~t to haue them established more stronglie, he alleadgeth the <HI>Romane fasts,</HI> who, as he sayth, can neither faile nor lye. But on the contrarie, <HI>Onuphrius</HI> who hath corrected them iustly, maketh a doubt. And as Master <HI>Augier</HI> sayth, he likewise would relye vpon the annales of <HI>Fa|bius</HI> pictor. And in the first place the better to confirme his Square, being
<PB REF="26">
the roote of the fatall number, compo|sed of twelue Twelues, multiplied by<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bodin great|ly erred.</NOTE> 12. he saith that the Monarchie of <HI>Rome</HI> continued a hundred and fortie yeares, which by the consent of all authors continued 244. yeares, or thereabout: and I finde another which saith it endu|red longer, namely, 245. yeares, which cannot serue to fulfil the <HI>Cube</HI> of the fa|tall number&punc; but it is an exceeding fault to slippe a hundred yeares. Further|more,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A 100. yeeres slipt by M. Bodin. 196.</NOTE> to confirme one of the perfect numbers, namely, that of 196. and to shew the effect of it, he sayth, that since <HI>Augustus</HI> vnto <HI>Augustulus</HI> the last Em|perour of the <HI>Romanes,</HI> the one whereof he calleth by the name of <HI>Conquering,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">All <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">hese shall be more plainely set downe in my booke of the vniuersall periods of all Kingdomes.</NOTE> the other of <HI>Diminishing,</HI> there was 496. yeares; where the Histories and Chro|nicles mention fiue hundred. On the other side, to the intent the better to ground his opinion of nu~bers; as like|wise to shewe their force, he alleadgeth that in holie scripture the law of GOD<NOTE PLACE="marg">The 7. num|ber.</NOTE> hath nothing so often as the 7. number;
<PB REF="27">
be it either in the solemne feasts, of the Sabboth, or the seauenth moneth; be it for the freeing of seruants, and leauing the ground without tilth, the seauenth yeare, which was the yeare of <HI>Iubile.</HI> But some doe reproue this, for as much as that the places out of scripture implie<NOTE PLACE="marg">It is no Sab|both for a Kingdome to fall.</NOTE> naturally a rest or Sabboth, whereas on the contrarie the seauenth, alleadged for the fall, and change of kingdomes, is full of troubles, depending on hu|mane actions, which number can nei|ther be drawne out of the law of God, either in plaine tearmes, or by way of<NOTE PLACE="marg">The 7. num|ber not drawen out of Scripture necessarilie.</NOTE> necessarie consequent: yet for all this he confesseth, that of those aboue na|med rules, indifferently obserued of di|uers authors, there is none of necessitie, whereupon wee may so iustly relye our selues, as to set down a certaine iudge|ment of things to come: seeing that the greatest part of those, who haue been willing to iudge of the meanes, &amp; rules surely touching the foresayd changes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vncertainty in Diuinati|ons.</NOTE> they haue ofte~ stayed themselues vpon
<PB REF="27">
Astronomie, supposing that change of Kingdomes chieflie to depende vpon starres, and celestiall causes, whereunto God hath sometimes (as it were) tyed himselfe for the shewing of things to come; wherein Satan as the Prince of<NOTE PLACE="marg">A sleight of Satan.</NOTE> the ayre, maketh to appeare oftentimes the eue~ts which resemble the true, that should happen: and hereupon he for|geth these false predictions. But seeing that by the effects of celestiall bodies, the vnlearned themselues are able to iudge of their force and vertue; not|withstanding from all antiquitie, there hath been found contrarietie of opi|nions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The certain|tie and vn|certaintie of Astronomi|call iudge|ments.</NOTE> amongst them who will iudge soundly in <HI>Astrologie:</HI> wherefore it shall not bee impertinent to this purpose to handle a word or two for the exami|ning of the certaintie or vncertaintie of them, thereby the better to vnder|stand this which I haue in hand, the ra|ther because <HI>Astrologie</HI> it selfe is placed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Astrologie.</NOTE> amongst <HI>Diuinations.</HI> Some &amp; of great learning would whollie make it fru|strate,
<PB REF="28">
and exclude it from the liberall<NOTE PLACE="marg">An absurd error begot|ten of igno|rance.</NOTE> Arts, as teaching vs prestigious &amp; false surmises vnder trueths colour. Some are so foolish, that they giue vnto it the force of gouerning the whole world: namely, all that which may happen to<NOTE PLACE="marg">A foolish Superstition.</NOTE> men, not daring to attempt, or vnder|take any thing in the world without the fauour of the starres and celestiall bo|dies.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zanch. Myzald.</NOTE> Others that haue better iudged of it haue not ascribed vnto them an ab|solute power, but an intermediate ver|tue amongst the rest. The reason of such as wholly contemne the Art with|out<NOTE PLACE="marg">No good rea|son.</NOTE> ascribing vnto it anie vertue, or force at all, is grounded vpon the vn|certaintie of it, as being onely builded vpon vncertaine coniectures, without the true demonstration of things, wher|vpon onely trueth depends. But those that do auouch the vertue of them, sup|pose in the first place, that God sayd in the beginning that he made lights, that<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 1.</NOTE> he placed them in the heauens, to sepa|rate night from day, and to be for signes
<PB REF="28">
and seasons for dayes and yeares. From this place they reason thus, that Nature made nothing in vaine, since that all creatures are made for some certaine end, but these creatures day lie doe the same workes by their order and course appoynted them of God, and the end of<NOTE PLACE="marg">No good reason.</NOTE> that which they doe is their operation; now the starres doe by the order of na|ture that which the Art of Astronomie saith hath bin found out by experience, and afterward approued by many rea|sons. Then the end of the starres is that for which they were created. Likewise the demonstrations of things are taken from celestiall causes, and their effects, obserued of a long timed experience, by the influence, intension, remission, ac|cesse and recesse of starres: for euen as<NOTE PLACE="marg">An vnlike similitude.</NOTE> in the seede the vertue of those things is hid which it bringeth foorth, euen so in the starres is hid the force of that like|wise giuing the effect of a naturall ele|mentarie change, which is incontinent|ly perceiued of them who before haue
<PB REF="29">
searched by supputation the caelestiall motions, and haue attained by long ex|perience to knowe the course of things, with the euents and effects. The reason is, for euen as wee iudge of the force of things which wee feele, by their effect, euen so wee iudge of the force of Starres by the experience we haue from the long reach of their effects. And al|though their force being hid vnto vs, is<NOTE PLACE="marg">It is impossi|ble to haue such experi|ence.</NOTE> not so apparantly discouered and clere|ly seene, notwithstanding the ordinarie signes shew them, and the common ob|seruations of long experience make the~ to bee easilie knowne; so that those who haue this foresaid experience, may easi|ly foretell by an euident coniecture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This possible &amp; common.</NOTE> the ordinarie effect of the Starres. But thereby to foretell of the natiuities of men which the Greekes cal <HI>pronosti|con Geneseon,</HI> that which may happen<NOTE PLACE="marg">Meere toies and vaine fables.</NOTE> vnto them in such a yeare, or such a day, it is hard for a man to giue credit to them; so that it be not for the search|ing of naturall causes in that manner,
<PB REF="29">
as wee haue spoken before. For as Ma|ster <HI>Beza</HI> speaketh in a certaine epistle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beza his opinion of Iudiciall Astrologie.</NOTE> of iudiciall Astrologie: <HI>If any one would haue foretolde that the Empyre of Augustus should haue endured so long, it should like|wise haue beene necessarie to haue diuined what should haue happened of Brutus, Cas|sius, Lepidus, and Anthonie, his aduersa|ries, which would haue brought a man into a labyrinth not easely auoyded.</HI> So likewise<NOTE PLACE="marg">How far one may iudge of particular men.</NOTE> speaking of the vsage of the former searching, hee referres them onely to complexions, and dispositions of bo|dies, by meanes whereof, one may iudge if such a man will become melan|cholicke, or whether he will be subiect to such or such sickenesses. This opini|on is confirmed somewhat by that of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phisitions.</NOTE> <HI>Diogenes</HI> the <HI>Stoike;</HI> notwithstanding the Phisitians themselues are able to iudge of all things aboue mentioned by signes, and <HI>Symptoms</HI> more certaine, and yet there of the profite is not great. O|thers who vnder a shewe of religion, haue contemned the Astrologicall sci|ence,
<PB REF="30">
alledge for reason the place of <HI>Ie|remie</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The art con|temners of this age, mis|vnderstand Ieremie.</NOTE> saying: <HI>Let them stand and saue thee the Southsayers of heaue~, which gaze on the starres, and cast the moneths to tell thee of things to come:</HI> yet notwithstanding the true meaning of that place is no whit to condemne, or detest the foresaide science, but onely the superstitious a|buse of it, which hath been brought in by little and little, by those who by meanes of their Diabolicall artes, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">The abuse of Astronomie.</NOTE> vnder the hope of some base gayne, haue corrupted the true knowledge of it. Others erroniouslie haue sought out all the secrets of the world, by meanes of caelestiall causes, in such sort, that con|tinuing in the same superstition, they are at the length fallen into so great a|buse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He that yeeldeth himselfe to beleeue Pronostica|tions, giueth himselfe the 1. of Ianua|rie to be a foole al the yeare after.</NOTE> that they will gouerne all their ac|tions, according to the course and de|monstration of Starres, preferring their Pronostications before Gods promi|ses. From hence proceedeth the super|stitious elections of workes, good or bad, gouerned according to the twelue

signes of heauen: in like manner the<NOTE PLACE="marg">My L Hen|ry Haward in lib. of sup|posed Pro|phets.</NOTE> dayes fortunate, and vnfortunate; with the angles and circles forged by the Phi|losopher <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> to knowe by the composition of numbers and letters which it conteined (intermediating the obseruation of the day of the moneths, and the Planets) all that any man desired to know. To conclude, from hence is it<NOTE PLACE="marg">Errours fro~ hence.</NOTE> come to passe, that some are perswaded that the soules abide in the Moone: o|thers were perswaded that as soone as she lost her light, she was inchaunted: and for that cause in olde time they were wont to sound Trumpets, Tabrets, Cor|nets and other instruments to remedie that, to the intent to driue away those<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 1.

To the intent then that we may soundly iudge of A|strologie, let vs conclude (following<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Astro|nomers can doe by their art.</NOTE> the common opinion) that Astrolo|gers generally cannot foretell any o|ther thing by the knowledge of their art, but that which concerneth the con|stitution of the ayre, and the particular change of that, according to the de|monstration of the coelestiall signes. But concerning those tokens and signes that appeare extraordinarily in the hea|uens, as Comets, and such like strange ap|paritions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Comets.</NOTE> (although the prediction of their effect depend sometimes on cae|lestiall causes) yet notwithstanding in
<PB REF="31">
my opinion such signes are more cer|taine and sure in their operation, to sig|nifie the change and euents of Com|mon wealths then any other; for if wee<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zanch. de oper. lib. 3. cap. 2.</NOTE> would search the histories of all times, wee shall finde that neuer Comet ap|peared, which vndoubtedly brought not after it some generall or particular change, and most often the sad and la|mentable euents of warre, plague famin, deluges, the death of great personages, and the like; but by reason that these fall out extraordinarilie, so likewise their effects are extraordinarie. Those that are curious to knowe the euents which at all times haue been obserued, &amp; wherof the histories are full, may read the catalogue of wonders, written in la|tine by M. <HI>Fritschius,</HI> and imprinted at<NOTE PLACE="marg">And Era|stus de Co|me<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">is.</NOTE> <HI>Noremberge,</HI> where he recites abundance in all kindes.

the Comet in the yeare 1577. and the earthquake which followed, which<NOTE PLACE="marg">Earthquakes</NOTE> is also numbred amongst strange and prodigious signes. A certaine Mathe|matician in his booke of the discourse, and Pronostication by him made, con|cerning a Comet seene in the yeare 1581. saith amongst other things, that<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Comet. 1581.</NOTE> the Comet in the yeare 1577. (where|of wee spake) was in the <HI>Horoscope</HI> of <HI>Don Iohn,</HI> and in the sixt house of <HI>Moun|sieur</HI> the Duke of <HI>Alenson,</HI> which two<NOTE PLACE="marg">No vndoub|ted certaine|tie in Co|mets.</NOTE> had both been partakers of the same fortune, if credit might haue been gi|uen to that. Certaine it is, that Comets and extraordinarie signes of heauen doe daylie portend some noueltie, good or euill for some. The redempti|on<NOTE PLACE="marg">Starres fro~ time to time haue fore|shewed won|ders to come.</NOTE> of mankinde was presaged by an extraordinarie signe of Heauen, in forme of a Starre; which guided the wise men of the East to adore and wor|ship him, who was descended from hea|uen, to drawe vs from eternall damna|tion. And in the time of the Emperor
<PB REF="32">
<HI>Augustus,</HI> before the birth of our Saui|our Christ, many signes extraordinari|ly appeared in heauen, in such manner, that all the Diuines small and great were in armes (as it were) and flockt to|gether to aduise vpon it. And then whe~ as the Massacre continued throughout al France a new starre bega~ to appeare in the heaue~, whereof the Lord <HI>Plesseyes</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dever. Chr.

The wise of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heauens signes serue to confute Atheists.</NOTE> world who in a deepe irreligious poli|cy thought al things to be eternal, now began to worship a Creator. And what shall wee thinke (sayth he) but that it signifieth the newe birth of Christ in earth by the preaching of the Gospell? Wee reade also of a certaine flame of fire which shewed it selfe miraculously in the heauen right aboue the armie of <HI>Licinius</HI> the Emperour of the East, at the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Licinius.</NOTE>
<PB REF="33">
same time when hee lost the battell a|gainst <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great, then when there was question for an vniuersall chaunge of the Romane Empire, and a totall destruction of Gods Church: for the one maintained the Christians, the other tyrannized vpon them, and in the cruellest manner put them to death. Hereupon followed a most bloudy and deadly warre betwixt these two. It was then or a little before that <HI>Constantine</HI> had seene in the heauen the victorious Crosse of Christ, whereof <HI>Eusebius</HI> spea|keth so assuredly: For when he would combate, <HI>Maxence</HI> hauing seene the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maxent.</NOTE> foresayd Crosse with this inscription a|bout it, <HI>In this signe shalt thou ouercome thy enemies:</HI> he caused then the Chri|stians to come, and enquired of them concerning our Lord and Sauiour Ie|sus Christ, of his natiuitie, of his pas|sion, of his resurrection. The scripture likewise teacheth vs, that the signes &amp; tokens from heauen threaten vs and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> bring strange punishments, as appea|reth
<PB REF="33">
by the place of <HI>Ieremie,</HI> where he sayth, <HI>A signis coeli nolite timere:</HI> which<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ieremie mis|construed.</NOTE> some would haue expounded, that wee should not relie vpon the starres, nor haue any care of that which they may signifie: these are such as are most wil|ling to contemne the arte and skill of Astronomie. The meaning of <HI>Ieremies</HI> words are no such thing: for he would not seeme either to contemne or con|demne the signes of heauen, thereby to despise Astronomie, but only to admo|nish the faithfull fearing God, to the in|tent they might remaine confirmed &amp; strengthened in Gods promises, with|out being discouraged or fearefull in their mindes by the sight of the signes in heauen. On the other side, a man<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wonders in the aire to what they serue.</NOTE> may set downe the same iudgement of many other strange signes, which are shewed in the heauens contrarie to the course of nature, as Armies, Dragons, raining downe of bloud, fire, fearefull Eclipses, and such like, which bring of|ten times after them like chaunges to
<PB REF="34">
their owne strangenes. <HI>Cleanthes</HI> the Philosopher hauing marked foure cau|ses wherby a man may know the migh|tie puissance of the gods, hath put the extraordinarie signes of the heaue~s for the third cause: the Greekes called this kind of Diuination (<HI>Teratoscopia</HI>) that<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> is to say, a monstrous and strange vision. But when these and such calamities are whole and entire, as it happened to the townes of <HI>Sodom,</HI> of <HI>Gomorrah</HI> (which in <HI>Abrahams</HI> time were made a lake of Brimstone) and since that to the townes of <HI>Helice</HI> and <HI>Bura:</HI> that change is then as it were from death to life, &amp; by con|sequent farre more great and more no|table then of a Monarchie turned into an <HI>Aristocratie</HI> and <HI>Democratie,</HI> or any o|ther kind of common wealth; and ther|fore well deserueth to bee added to the chapter of chaunges, and ruines of Common wealths.

<PB REF="34">
Inundations vniuersall, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inundations.</NOTE> particular, are of this sort. Furthermore wee may here adde to the Diuinations aboue sayd, the great Coniunctions of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Coniuncti|ons of Pla|nets.</NOTE> the hye Planets, which are principallie set to play together, thereby to iudge of the chaunge and fall of a Common|wealth. And although these depende likewise vpon Astrologie, yet notwith|standing these seeme to bee more cer|taine and better grounded then any o|ther particular predictions of the stars, by reason of their reuolution and ordi|narie running euerie eight hundred yeare, or there about, according to the opinion of Master <HI>Augier Ferrier,</HI> which<NOTE PLACE="marg">No absolute necessitie.</NOTE> as a man would think haue shewed their effect (as it were) to the touch, and to the eye, with an astonishment of the wise, although that draw not with it any meere necessitie.

<P>Now remaineth the last poynt, which principally hath moued me to alleadge those places, concerning this subiect
<PB REF="35">
matter which we haue in hand: that is, of Dreames, which the diuell spreadeth<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of dreames.</NOTE> as a meanes, to make his illusions pre|uaile, to make his craftie subtilties and false predictions of things to come to be of more force, knowing that men by an exceeding curiositie would force<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mans curio|sitie neuer staied.</NOTE> themselues, by vnlawfull meanes, to finde out the knowledge of the effect of them. Then because there are diuers sorts of Dreames, wee will make a di|stinction of the chiefe of them. And to inte~t to draw out the better knowledge of their difference, I thinke it good to diuide them into foure parts, (and the rather to auoyde the pluralities of de|grees, which authors haue made in the handling of them) that is to say, Natu|rall, Diuellish, Diuinatorie (or as the Greekes call it <HI>Simantica</HI>) and Diuine. The naturall Dreames are when things<NOTE PLACE="marg">Naturall Dreames. 1.</NOTE> before either seene, heard, or touched, or fore-thought of, &amp; afterward as re|peated in the phantasie, are represen|ted sleeping, bringing the visions which

These diuelish an|swers
<PB REF="37">
abouesaide, they termed oracles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oracles.</NOTE> and they had diuers names.

Then it is a thing most cleare, that Satan will i|mitate
<PB REF="38">
all manner of fashions, the bet|ter to abuse men vnder a pretence of<NOTE PLACE="marg">A perfect Ape.</NOTE> holines: as when God shewed himselfe to <HI>Moyses</HI> in the burning bush, &amp; when<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 3.

from whence all had their beginning.

There haue been also of other nations, as <HI>Greekes,</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> who obserued other sortes of superstitions and idola|tries by them to forge their diuinati|ons, which they did to the imitation of the diuine sacrifices, by the inspection of the intrales of beastes which were slaine, namely the liuer, the hart, and the gall, which the Latins call <HI>Extispici|um,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Extispiciu~.</NOTE> <HI>quasi extorum inspectio.</HI> Finallie, from hence came it in former time that they haue sacrificed humane flesh as it is ap|parant:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cruell Ido|latry.</NOTE> a thing which was ordinarie long since in the westerne <HI>Ilands,</HI> and chiefely with the <HI>Normanes</HI> and <HI>Danes,</HI> who alwaies in the moneth of Ianuary<NOTE PLACE="marg">Barbarous sacrifices.</NOTE> made an oblation yearely of ninetie nine men.

the art of diuining by the fly|ing<NOTE PLACE="marg">Augures.</NOTE> of birds, and chiefely by the <HI>Angures,</HI> who had the young ones to that ende nourished in Cages, to serue them for their vses: but in the ende they were so mocked with them, as <HI>P.

<P>The Dreames which wee call Diuina|torie or presaging, differ from naturall Dreames, in that these happen not by reason of the motion, or abundance of any humor, or other qualitie of the bo|die, but by a singular vertue and influ|ence
<PB REF="41">
of the starres, who (as it were) mo|ued with an vnderstanding of things to come, affect likewise the braine of him that dreameth by a commixtion &amp; con|iunction<NOTE PLACE="marg">How starres worke in our Dreames.</NOTE> of the first qualities, which are betwixt the~ from the beginning, in such sort that the Dreamer being as it were aduertised, hee imprinteth that in his braine, and so continually thinking to knowe the euent, by little and little, the formes and figures of things to come represent themselues vnto his spirit. Somtimes that is reueiled by a compa|rison of things to come, as the Dreame of King <HI>Astyages,</HI> who dreamed that<NOTE PLACE="marg">The dreame of Astyages.</NOTE> from the wombe of his daughter <HI>Mada|nes</HI> came forth a Vine so great &amp; large, that it couered with the shadowe of it all the parts of his Realme.

The same may ap|peare
<PB REF="42">
in the Dreames of <HI>Nabuchadnez|zar</HI> (in respect of things prefigured) in the forme of a high Image and a great, as it is set downe in <HI>Daniel.</HI> But for so much as the manner of Dreames aboue sayd seemeth to be very strange and al|together vncredible, by reason of the <HI>Sympathie</HI> spoken of before: and that there be some skilful me~, who (holding it impossible that which some go about to haue to bee beleeued of that <HI>Sympa|thie</HI> betwixt earthly &amp; heauenly things) are perswaded it is impossible from thence to haue such intelligence. O|thers who are of opinion that this <HI>Sym|pathie</HI> both may bee and is, suppose for insta~ce the <HI>Sympathie</HI> betwixt the starres of the North and the Adamant stone;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ada|mant.</NOTE> whereas wee see continually that those starres draw that stone: Likewise we see that certaine flowers open and shut af|ter the approaching &amp; departing of the Sunne: That the Nightingall and the<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cuc|kowe. The Nigh|tingall.</NOTE> Cuckow both grow hoarse at the rising of <HI>(Syrius)</HI> the Dogge starre: that the
<PB REF="42">
humours abound in the full Moone, &amp;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luna. Iupiter. Saturne. Sol.</NOTE> afterward diminish: In like manner that some constitutions of starres can go|uerne and maintaine, and on the con|trarie others corrupt the humours in some parts of the bodie. And for con|firmation hereof they alleadge vs a rea|son, that God in the beginning hath gi|uen and ingrafted in euery of his crea|tures made by his owne hand, a speciall vertue and a secret propertie, which are hid and contained in the seedes of them, from whence successiuely are procrea|ted all corporall things, receiuing their forme by a commixtion and tempera|ture of qualities, according to that or|der of nature which God hath appoyn|ted. And although the starres so draw|ing the Adamant stone, haue not a po|wer or vertue to giue entyre formes to creatures themselues, yet notwithstan|ding the world below, being compas|sed with the heauen, as it is, and all that<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note this.</NOTE> it containeth, as wel in respect of things created, as generated, they are all go|uerned<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zanch.</NOTE>
<PB REF="43">
and maintained (by a diuine po|wer) of a celestial light; and the especial vertue of the aire, which not only shines through darknes (as the common sort doe imagine) but containeth in it an excellent and diuine vertue, sustaining with a life-making heate al the creatures of the world, according to the course of nature: for (as one sayth) the heauen<NOTE PLACE="marg">Austin.</NOTE> so comma~deth the earth, as God com|mandeth the Angels, the Angels men, men beasts, the soule the bodie, the rea|son the appetite. Neither must we think that these creatures are onely maintai|ned by their proper seede and the mix|ture<NOTE PLACE="marg">Influence and celestial heate. <HI>Iupiter Sta|tor Ascent. in cap. 13. lib. 2.

<PB REF="43">
the light of the fire comming out of the flint constantly shewes it selfe vntill that be consumed which is enlighted, euen such a light commeth from aboue, which gouerneth and sustaineth as a nurse all the liuing creatures belowe. Master <HI>Barlasse</HI> in the second day of his weeke speaketh fitly to that purpose, and saith.</P>

<P>Then from this coniunction and hea|uenly<NOTE PLACE="marg">The force of the bodies heauenly in these earth|ly.</NOTE> allyance proceedeth a meruai|lous concord, and naturall agreement betwixt heauenly and earthly bodies. There is no man who findeth not in himselfe the vertue proceeding from the Sunne beames, which in the exposi|tion of <HI>Iosephs</HI> dreame is called the <HI>Fa|ther</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iosephus de antiqu. lib. 2.</NOTE> and <HI>nourisher,</HI> as it is written in the second booke of the antiquities of the

Iewes: The bodies &amp; spirits of all things are recreated by the rising of the Sunne.

It is the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note this.</NOTE> aboue named heauenly light, which a|waketh in vs some part of that vertue, which she lent vs, at our first beginning: hereby happeneth the change of flow|ers, of the beastes before mentioned, of the inclination of the Adamant towards the North. In like sorte if we would sup|pose the foresaid coniunction and natu|rall agreement which is in the creatures aboue mentioned, we should finde it no

whit strange: the Sympathie which is<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ground of Sympathy.</NOTE> saide to bee betwixt some heauenly and earthly bodies, which is made by an in|terchangeable touch of the supposed naturall coniunction, consisting in the agreement of their formall qualities. Thus much of Sympathie.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding all that wee haue said, both concerning the singular ver|tue of the starres, causing the foresaide presaging dreames, as also in respect of Astrologie it selfe, there is an opinion<NOTE PLACE="marg">An excelle~t writer.</NOTE> at this day quite contrarie. For <HI>Nico|dem Frischlin,</HI> a late Astronomer hol|deth it as a Paradoxe, that none of all the starres haue any vertue either ge|nerall, or speciall vpon the things be|lowe, and hee derideth all those, who think the Starres haue vertue to warme,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vnlikely in my opinion.</NOTE> to coole, to drie, to moysten. And in like manner, that neither <HI>Aries, Leo, Tau|rus,</HI> or any other of the celestiall signes, haue any force to affect the things be|lowe.

<P>By meanes whereof, hee maintaines it a<NOTE PLACE="marg">An vnsound conclusion.</NOTE> thing impossible, either to measure the height of the heauen aboue, or the depth of the earth belowe: according to the testimonie of the Prophet <HI>Iere|mie,</HI> saying: <HI>If the heauens can be measured, or the foundations of the earth bee searched out beneath, then will I cast off, &amp;c.</HI> But a|mongst other particular reasons, which hee alleadgeth to the ende to confirme his opinion, hee saith further in these wordes (which I thinke conuenient to alleadge.) <HI>Prim&ograve; Deus ille mundi opifex, in alium vsum stellas non creauit nisi vt noctu</HI>

Lastly, with his excellencie, to admonish vs of the wis|dome of the workeman, as one that made all thinges for some good ende. He denyeth also, that the change of the ayre, and the season, are caused by the particular starres&punc; so that this new A|stronomer ascribeth all the force of the starres, to the Sunne; and not particu|larlie to the vertue of any speciall starre which borroweth light from it. Here|unto hee addeth diuers other reasons, which may be found in the third booke
<PB REF="46">
of his Astrologie: Neither is it mate|riall though (saith hee) it come to passe sometimes as they haue foretolde, for God so testifieth that it shall happen, Deutero. 13. <HI>For if there rise in the middest</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 13.</NOTE> <HI>of thee a Prophet, or a dreamer of dreames, who giue thee a signe or miracle, and that the signe or miracle which he tolde thee come to passe, thou shalt not heare the wordes of this Prophet or dreamer: for the Lorde your God tempteth you to see if you loue them. For it is he onely that knoweth all things to come.</HI> On the other side, concerning that which some say of <HI>Moses</HI> and the Prophet <HI>Daniel,</HI> as it is written, <HI>That</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 7.</NOTE> <HI>Moses was skilfull in all the knowledge of the Egyptians,</HI> that ought not to bee vn|derstoode<NOTE PLACE="marg">An vnlike coniecture.</NOTE> of Astrologie, or <HI>Mateologie,</HI> but of skill in the Hebrue learning, and of such like artes: Wherein there is no|thing contrarie to Gods trueth: and we see the flat contrarie, that <HI>Moses</HI> in the presence of King <HI>Pharaoh</HI> reprehended the diuines of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and discouered their abominable superstitions. The
<PB REF="46">
same may appeare by <HI>Daniel</HI> and his companions, who had in such hatred the diuelish arts that rayned in the court of the King of <HI>Babylon,</HI> that they con|cluded al to abstaine from eating of the Kings dainties. Then because it seemes strange to holde against the common opinion of all Astronomers, that the change of the ayre, and that a happie or vnhappie time is no whit caused by the particular vertue of the starres, as to this present hath beene obserued, how<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ob.</NOTE> happeneth it, that in the 16. of Matth. and in the 12. of Luke, the tempests and stormes, and also faire weather are fore|tolde by the appearance of heauen? To<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sol.</NOTE> this he answereth and saith, that it is one<NOTE PLACE="marg">A signe &amp; a cause dif|fer.</NOTE> thing to coniecture by signes likely, and another to foretell what must happen from causes necessarie. For signes and causes farre differ the one from the o|ther, as for example, the dawning of the day or the twilight, are neither causes of raine nor faire weather, but onely a signe ioyned to the nature of the thing,
<PB REF="47">
which thereby shewes vnto vs the con|stitution of the ayre: euen as wee see a Phisition, who by the colour of the v|rin can easely iudge of the disposition of the bodie, yet no man will say that<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Simili|tude.</NOTE> the colour is the cause of his sicknes; in like manner of the heauen, a signe but no cause. The same also may bee done by the appeara~ce of&punc; the Sun or Moone: neuertheles, it is by the euidence of such signes as necessarilie shall happen, and as he saith. <HI>A causis iam fieri &amp; in|cipientibus, hoc est, vbi iam causa est in ef|fectu aliquo posita.</HI> From thence are the causes of the predictions of the change of ayre, and of bad times by the Mari|ners, Phisitions, and such like, whereun|to those may bee referred of <HI>Uirgil,</HI> in diuerse places, all which differ from the predictions &amp; prognostications, which the Astronomers ordinarily doe forge vnto vs, a whole yeare before: <HI>Et qui ex causis remotissimis praedicunt effectus.</HI> In the end he concludes, that these predic|tions and Astrologicall diuinations
<PB REF="47">
are wholly forbidden, as wel by equitie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Frischlin is too veheme~t against A|stronomers.</NOTE> as by holy Scripture: and as God him|selfe speaketh in the 37. of <HI>Iob, It is im|possible for man to sounde the depth of hea|uen and earth.

<P>Vpon the other side, to returne to Dreames whereof wee haue begun to speak before: those dreames that come by reason of a <HI>Sympathie,</HI> are placed a|mongst<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dreames by reason of a Sympathie.</NOTE> those of presaging, as when one friend dreameth of another: As for ex|ample, wee haue that of <HI>Calphurnia</HI> wife<NOTE PLACE="marg">Calphurnia.</NOTE> of <HI>Iulius Caesar,</HI> who dreamed the day before he was murdered, that she sawe her husband lye wounded in her bo|some, and for that cause she prayed him earnestly not to goe that day vnto the
<PB REF="49">
Senate: But to the intent he might not be thought to be skarred with a woma~s dreame, he went &amp; was slaine. It is sayd that <HI>Catherine</HI> of <HI>Medices</HI> dreamed one<NOTE PLACE="marg">Katherine of Medices.</NOTE> day that King <HI>Henry</HI> her husband had one of his eyes put out, as it happened vnto him the next morning. But by rea|son of the trueth &amp; certitude of euents which these dreams haue brought with the~, some are of that opinion that they deserue rather to be called <HI>Diuine</HI> and <HI>Supernatural,</HI> then <HI>Diuinatorie,</HI> to the ex|ample of that of <HI>Pilats</HI> wife, who being set in the iudgeme~t Hall, she sent to him and told him, that he should not haue to doe with that iust one: for that night in her dreame she had suffered much be|cause of him, as it is in <HI>Matthew.</HI> That<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. 27.</NOTE> likewise of <HI>Caius Gracchus</HI> (by reason of a Sympathie and naturall coniunction) when that hee dreamed of <HI>Tiberius</HI> his<NOTE PLACE="marg">C.

<PB REF="49">
of superstition in the world, by reason<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dreames the fountain of superstiti|on.</NOTE> of vnlawfull meanes, which men vse to attaine to the knowledge of the euents of things to come, for this cause wee ought not either to obserue, or giue<NOTE PLACE="marg">Not to trust them.</NOTE> credite vnto the~, nor interpret them, as God hath commanded. The trueth and effect of prophesies which is drawne from them is discouered, and made knowne by the ende and impossibilitie (as the scripture speaketh by the works of the Prophet.) Although wee see of|tentimes by experience, that the diuell<NOTE PLACE="marg">So at Christs presence.</NOTE> sayth the trueth for feare: although in the Acts hee mocketh the Inchaunters which knowe not Christ, and entreateth them so ill that they go hurt out of the chamber. And in the 8. and 9. chapter of <HI>Exodus,</HI> after the dust was turned into lice, the Inchaunters themselues finally confessed that the finger of God was there, and that they were not able to i|mitate the last miracle as they had done the former. For example of these times, it is not long since that in the countrie
<PB REF="50">
of <HI>Northland</HI> there was a mayd by who~<NOTE PLACE="marg">The world is full of such.</NOTE> the diuell foretold the euent of things which came after, and he failed onely in one point, by which it was found out to bee an ill spirit, which being disguised from the beginning, at length discoue|red himselfe such as he was. The diuine<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diuine Dreames.</NOTE> Dreames which come by the immuta|ble counsell of God, are those whereof the holie scripture maketh mention, as of the Prophets and other persons, con|taining the reuelations of great mat|ters, of weight and importance; as of Iesus Christ, the gouernment of his Church, and other vnlooked for chan|ges. Such were the dreames of <HI>Ioseph</HI> &amp; the Prophets, which were knowne by their certaintie, and by the testimonie of trueth it selfe. Some haue made more degrees of diuine Dreames, to the in|tent to make knowne the diuersitie of meanes, which it hath pleased God in former time to vse in the reuelations of his prophesies, which may bee read at large in the fourth chapter of the first
<PB REF="50">
booke of Master <HI>Bodin</HI> his <HI>Demonona|nia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">God vseth often simple meanes.</NOTE> there he obserueth as well in the re|uelation of diuine prophesies, as in ma|ny other miracles, that God is serued by persons of diuers qualitie &amp; condition, which had not the degree of ordinarie Prophets, whereof the scripture maketh mention, as of <HI>Esai, Ieremie,</HI> &amp; others. But wee shall finde that oftentimes the same is done by persons heroicall, and of great respect; as appeareth by the dreames of <HI>Pharaoh, Nabuchadnezzar,</HI> &amp; others, especially in great matters, con|cerning the state of Monarchies &amp; Em|pires. The same he doth sometime in things particular and of lesse moment, as may bee proued by infinite places of scripture, &amp; other histories. The dreame of the Emperour <HI>Mauricius</HI> (by reason<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mauricius.</NOTE> of the diuine prouidence which may be marked in it) may serue vs for an exam|ple, who dreamed that he should be de|liuered to a serua~t of his named <HI>Phocas,</HI> to be slaine: for this cause he sent for the Captaine <HI>Philippick</HI> to come out of pri|son,
<PB REF="51">
and demanded of him if there were not one named <HI>Phocas:</HI> the other an|swered that there was such a one, a <HI>cen|turion, ambitious,</HI> and <HI>fearefull.</HI> Where|vpon the Emperour sayd, alleadging an olde prouerbe to that ende, <HI>If he be a co|ward</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A coward a murderer.</NOTE> <HI>he is a murderer.</HI> This was the same, who after that he had first slaine his wife and children, caused his head to bee cut off: but the recitall of it is memorable, that <HI>Maurice</HI> seeing his children murde|red by <HI>Phocas,</HI> and that he himselfe must be put to death presently, he spake of|ten in this manner, <HI>O Lord thou art iust,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> <HI>and so are all thy workes.</HI> In like manner, the dreame of <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great is al|so worth the marking, who marching with his armie toward <HI>Iudea,</HI> met with the hie Priest clothed in his solemne at|tyre, who came to demaund peace of him in the name of the people. <HI>Alexan|der</HI> seeing that, lighted from his horse, and saluted him with great reuerence, and promised them peace. His Cap|taines amazed hereat, incontinentlie
<PB REF="51">
demanded, what made <HI>Alexander</HI> to do<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alexander.</NOTE> such honor to the Priest. <HI>Alexander</HI> said, that before the warres of <HI>Macedon</HI> hee had seene him in a vision in the same forme and fashion that hee came vnto him, calling him to come into <HI>Asia,</HI> and commanding him to make warre with the <HI>Persians,</HI> and he put foorth his hand as it were to guide him. And so seeing now that this high Priest is most like to the former visio~, he was perswaded that God had some care of his people there, and for that cause he would spare them, as indeede he shewed afterward, both by freeing them from tribute, and de|fending them against their enemies. By reason whereof some are of that opi|nion, that it is very likely that the <HI>Iewes</HI> aduertised <HI>Alexander</HI> then of the pro|phesie of <HI>Daniel,</HI> hauing foretold 200. yeare before, that the King of <HI>Greece</HI> should conquer <HI>Persia.</HI> The dreame of the Emperour <HI>Theodosius</HI> was such like,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theodosius.</NOTE> then when as sleeping it seemed vnto him that by a certaine vision hee was
<PB REF="52">
commaunded to goe combat <HI>Eugenius</HI> and <HI>Argobastus,</HI> both Tyrants &amp; sworne enemies to the name of God, which hee did, and in fighting vpon a sodaine such a great storme arose, that in all respects so hindred the enemie, that that was the cause of the victorie, and the victorie the cause of the Poets song <HI>Claudianus:</HI></P>

<P>On the other side, GOD reuealeth sometimes the truth of things to come, by the meanes of some men who are of good life and fearing God; wherein the dreame of <HI>Mardocay</HI> concerning Queene <HI>Esther</HI> his Neece, &amp; of <HI>Aman,</HI> (as it is written in the booke of <HI>Hester</HI>) shall serue vs for example. In like man|ner the dreame of <HI>Anthonie</HI> the Hermit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Anthonie the Hermit.</NOTE> who dreamed that he sawe hogs which pulled down the Altars with their feet, and awaking sayd, that the Church of God should come to bee spoyled and wasted by whoremasters, adulterers, &amp;c. as afterward it came to passe. <HI>Phi|lip</HI>
<PB REF="52">
<HI>Melanchton</HI> noteth this prophesie a|gainst<NOTE PLACE="marg">Melanchto~.</NOTE> the voluptuous life of the Monks &amp; Priests. Many such like dreames may be found out in the course of histories. Now these dreames whereof wee haue spoken, and all such as are of the same sort, are acknowledged for good, by the conformitie which they haue to the will of GOD, and to the trueth of the dreame, as God himselfe hath taught vs in the 23. of <HI>Ieremie,</HI> saying, <HI>The Prophet</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iere. 23.</NOTE> <HI>that hath a dreame let him tell a dreame, and he that hath my word let him speake my word faithfully, &amp;c.</HI> Furthermore, the hi|stories of all ages do teach vs, that God manifesteth sometimes the trueth of some things by the meanes of inspira|tion<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inspiration.</NOTE> onely without dreame; which fa|shion of prophesying is put in the se|cond degree of prophesies: and this he doth when as one perceiueth waking somthing which entreth into his soule, which he may vtter to the praise of God and his workes; wherein God vseth such persons as it pleaseth him. And al|though
<PB REF="53">
it may seeme needles to haue many prophecies, by reason that by many visions and diuine reuelations continued in the holy Scripture, wee are alreadie assured of Gods trueth and good pleasure, yet notwithstanding histories, besides experience, haue de|clared<NOTE PLACE="marg">But great care must be had herein by reason of so manie false inspirations.</NOTE> vnto vs, that we haue such daylie, and that God neuer ceaseth to send ad|uertisements to men; bee it by dreame, vision, or any other meanes, to make them knowe his will, to the intent to guide and gouerne them according to the same; as well for the preseruing of Empires, as of his people, and his owne Church: Then for example of such ad|uertisements and diuine inspirations, whereof wee now speake, wee haue that of the Christian Schoolemaster in <HI>Anti|och</HI> with <HI>Lybianus</HI> the Sophister, (when<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lybianus.</NOTE> as <HI>Iulian</HI> the Emperor, and also the <HI>A|postata,</HI> went against the <HI>Persians</HI>) who demaunded what thinkest thou that the carpenters sonne doth? <HI>The other answe|red him, the Creator of all thinges, whome</HI>
<PB REF="53">
<HI>thou scornefully callest the Carpenters sonne, is making a Cofin to intombe Iulian,</HI> and soone after the newes came that <HI>Iulian</HI> was slaine. The most admirable fore|sight of the Philosopher <HI>Cratippus,</HI> (al|though<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cratippus.</NOTE> he were a heathen) deserueth to be accounted amongst diuine predicti|ons; who then when as <HI>Pompey</HI> demaun|ded of him, if he were vanquisht in a iust cause, and a farre better one then his e|nemies, answered that a state and com|mon wealth vitious, and corrupt, re|quired a gouernour to bee a Monarch, and that so the periods of Empires were fatall, &amp; that the Common wealth<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note this.</NOTE> of the <HI>Romans</HI> should change at that in|stant (as afterward it happened) to an absolute Monarchie. The prediction of<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Iohn.</NOTE> Saint <HI>Iohn</HI> the Euangelist is not amisse for this purpose, who being in <HI>Ephesus,</HI> and going to the Bathes, founde in the same place <HI>Cerinthus</HI> the Sophister, blas|pheming the name of God, hee hearing it, said vnto his companions, Let vs goe hence, for this house will presently fall
<PB REF="54">
vpon the blasphemer and his auditors; hee was no sooner gone, but the house fell to the grounde vpon <HI>Cerinthus</HI> and his company. We reade also in <HI>Iosephus,</HI> that in the time of <HI>Herode</HI> there was a number of Pharisies, who refused to sweare to the Emperor, &amp; for that cause they weare constrayned to paye a great summe of money, as a recompence, which was payed for them by the wife of one <HI>Pheroras,</HI> &amp; in recompence there|of,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inspirations in former times.</NOTE> one amongst them reuealed a cer|taine secret vnto her, which hee said was inspired vnto him from God, namelie, that God had determined in his secret counsell to roote out <HI>Herode</HI> and all his race: and that the end of his kingdome was at hand; as afterward it happened. But it cost the Pharisies deare to haue foretolde the death of <HI>Herode,</HI> for hee made them al to be put to death before. Like examples to these may easilie bee founde (besides in histories) heere and there in holy Scriptures, which I omitte for breuitie sake. The late Chronicles
<PB REF="54">
testifie of <HI>Iohn Husse</HI> Martyr, that hee<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn Husse. Fox in lib. Martyr.</NOTE> tolde before his death, that the king|dome of the Pope should by little and little, come to ruine and vtter decaye, and that out of his ashes and cynders, there should rise a Swan which should<NOTE PLACE="marg">Meaning Luther which signi|fieth a swan.</NOTE> not bee rosted in the same sorte, as that Goose was rosted; speaking of himselfe; for the worde <HI>Husse</HI> in the <HI>Bohemian</HI> tongue signifieth a <HI>Goose.</HI> He foretold also, that his aduersaries a hundred yeares after his death should come to answer both God and him. M. <HI>Peucer</HI> speaking of the same prediction, saith that the effect followed, for after the <HI>Sy|nod</HI> of <HI>Constance,</HI> till the beginning of the disputatio~s of M. <HI>Luther</HI> were coun|ted a hundred yeares. At the selfe same time was fulfilled the third and last pe|riod of the 500. yeares; then that dark|nes of errors (wherewith Gods Church had been dimmed) began to be disper|sed and vanish away. The trueth of such like inspirations are knowne by their endes; as the Prophet <HI>Ieremie</HI> testifieth,
<PB REF="55">
saying, <HI>The Prophet that shall foretell of</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap. 38.</NOTE> <HI>peace, when his speech shall come to passe, then such a Prophet shall be knowne that the Lord sent him.</HI> In truth principally then, when it is perceiued by diuerse cir|cumstances, that the effect wholly de|pendeth vpon the will of God, by rea|son of the changing of matters of im|portance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Anote a|gainst pe|remptorie conclusions in Diuining.</NOTE> which we see to happen: like|wise wee see that God serueth himselfe with whom it pleaseth him, guiding and gouerning their spirites for the executi|on of his works, according to his good pleasure. For example of our times, there is extant the prediction of one <HI>Paule Greber,</HI> which hee made of the e|states<NOTE PLACE="marg">Paul Greber.</NOTE> &amp; Common wealths of <HI>Europe,</HI> of the house of <HI>Burgonie,</HI> and of the Lowe Countries, who amongst other things which he foretold (whereof many haue come to passe) he named the succession of the King of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> to the Crowne of <HI>France,</HI> in the yeare 1589. and pro|ceeding further in the course of that matter, hee promiseth greater things to
<PB REF="55">
the King of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> and of the good successe which hee shall haue in his af|faires, and of the Lowe Countries, that they shall speedilie bee deliuered from the tyrannie of <HI>Spaine:</HI> in one worde, as the prouerbe is, <HI>Halcionia promittit.</HI> But comming to the yeare 1590. hee telleth of the death of a great and mightie<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vncertaine who, and so are all such diuinations.</NOTE> king, enemy to the former, which death (saith hee) shall happen in the yeare 1590. But concerning any certaintie, or true coniectures in numbers, either of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Numbers vncertaine.</NOTE> yeares or such like, wherein Master <HI>Bo|din</HI> &amp; others are too curious, I let them passe as matter impertinent and things of too nice &amp; nimble coniecture. Then by the difference of dreames, whereof wee haue spoken before, by the distin|ction of their kinds, likewise by the ge|nerall exposition of diuinations, lawfull and vnlawful, it may be vnderstood and easily knowne, how to applie them to the alteration and chaunge of a Com|mon wealth. There be also other sorts of Diuinations besides these, but be|cause
<PB REF="56">
they cannot serue to iudge of the change of states (by requiring a whole treatise themselues, &amp; being most lear|nedly<NOTE PLACE="marg">My L.

But as of all the meanes and rules which haue been obserued from anti|quitie, to confirme the iudgement con|cerning the chaunge and fall of a Com|mon wealth, there is none necessarie, al|though<NOTE PLACE="marg">No rule ne|cessarie to iudge of the chaunge of a Kingdome.</NOTE> God sometimes permit things to fall out according to their naturall course: therfore it becommeth vs like|wise to attend patiently the ende &amp; the euents of all things, as God hath deter|mined in his immutable counsell, with|out presuming too farre, by too great a curiositie vnbeseeming our blind and dull capacities. And although by rea|son of our weaknes wee cannot sound the vnderstanding of the depth of those predictions, which GOD hath made, sometime by one meane, sometime by

these euils.

Now as the religious dutie to your Prince, the kind affection to your countrie, and the common care amongst your selues one towards ano|ther, are things not onely requisite for your good, but likewise commanded by the lawes of God and nature: so rebel|lion

And if it were not that false pretences (an vsuall cloak<NOTE PLACE="marg">Understan|ding misled, begets trea|son.</NOTE> for the greatest faults) did make men thinke they were lesse offensiue, neuer traitor would intend his Princes death, but take punishment of himselfe for so bad a thought: &amp; neuer subiects would draw their swords in seditious manner, but sheath them in the guiltie intrals of their owne bowels. And therfore those who haue intended to alter, or vsurpe<NOTE PLACE="marg">What is re|bellion.</NOTE> the state of their superiours (which we call rebellion) not to bee branded with so foule a shame; not to be noted with so blacke a marke; not to be called by so bad a name, haue indeuoured to sig|nifie their sinisters practises by a good pretence, and haue imployed such for

the effecting of them, as inconstancie hath made desirous of a chaunge, A|theisme careles by what meanes, Prodi|galitie<NOTE PLACE="marg">What men are traytors.</NOTE> beggars and full of want, and lastly want hath made them to growe desperate.

<PB REF="105">
and such like, things onely mentioned in name, and no further in|tended, then in a bare shewe: thus delt they that sought to alter the Romane Empire, by lighting the torch of ciuill dissention, (pretending the more easily to winne the people) to free them from subsidies and oppression, which then seemed by their gouernours to lye vpon them, making a shew to the com|mon sorte, that they tendered their case in so great a measure, that they could not longer indure to see them afflicted in so bad a manner. These pre|tences wee reade to haue been made in <HI>France,</HI> these haue been made in our countrie: and there was neuer either subiect seditious in the Commo~ wealth, or heretike hatefull to Gods Church, but they desired to be accounted Euan|gelike and Apostolike reformers, their<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note this.</NOTE> bad conuenticles (Cockatrices to hatch treason) they tearmed by the name of Gods Church, their phantasticall opi|nions, Gods knowne trueth, and their

poysoned heresies, the inspiration of Gods spirit. It were tedious &amp; too long to repeate their names, who continual|ly haue slaundered Loyaltie with base tearmes, when themselues haue deser|ued most badly, both of the Church and of the Common wealth. Thus might I with teares remember the wrong that I suffered in the <HI>Northerne Rebellion,</HI> where<NOTE PLACE="marg">As may ap|peare by the six articles written in french.</NOTE> though the fact was so infamous, as the memorie is odious to this day, yet did they pretend a reforming of religion, a freedome of conscie~ce, and a bettering of the Common wealth. I passe ouer without speech (but neuer to be reme~|bred without sighes) the lamentable re|bellions made in <HI>Lincolneshire,</HI> the disor|der<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Iohn Cheeke wrote of Sed. Alex.

These and such like haue laboured to roote me from the place of mine abode, to pull out Loyaltie from the mindes of subiects, to make them offend &amp; thinke there is no fault, to raise a flame that
<PB REF="106">
may giue light, whilest the Common|wealth shall burne; to stirre vp those vnder pretence of right, who haue de|sired to subuert the state of the whole land. <HI>Iosephus</HI> an ancient writer, setting downe the rebellious reuolting, which the Iewes made from the Romanes, vn|der colour of rude and vntoward dea|ling which they found in <HI>Florus</HI> their gouernour, he setteth downe the parti|cular remonstrance that King <HI>Agrippa</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Euer bad things haue good preten|ses.</NOTE> made, touching the small apparance of occasion which they had, rebelliously to exempt them from their lawfull obe|dience: the Iewes replied that it was on|ly against <HI>Florus,</HI> and not the Romanes, that they bare armes: whom <HI>Agrippa</HI> tolde it was easie to say so, but their ac|tions<NOTE PLACE="marg">So may I say to the Eng|lish traytors.</NOTE> were such as worse could not haue been by the greatest enemies of the Ro|mane Empire: for the townes they sac|ked, the treasuries they robbed, the houses they burnt, the fields they wa|sted; neither were the townes, the trea|suries, the houses, the fields of <HI>Florus,</HI>
<PB REF="106">
and no man had wrong but the Ro|manes, to whom these belonged. In like manner, when in former times (for I am loth to mention these later faults) wrong openly was offered to them of our countrie, the townes take~, the chur|ches robbed, the houses burnt, the men slaine, and not so much sacred, as the very sepulchers of our forefathers, the<NOTE PLACE="marg">By Ket.</NOTE> pretence was onely this, not a wrong or disobedience to the Prince, but a re|uenge and reformation of the oppres|sing cormorant. And thus lately (for I must needs touch it) whilest <HI>Lopez</HI> most Iewishlie, nay, Iudaslie had concluded with the Spanish Pharisies to sell his So|ueraigne, yet shamefully hee protested this, whereunto common sense will<NOTE PLACE="marg">A thing vn|likely and impossible.</NOTE> hardly allow credit, that he onely ment to deceiue them of their coyne, and to saue her from harme. Can we thinke the Spanyard so credulous as in a matter of so great importance to credit without good cause? Can wee thinke it likely, that he, who had concealed it hetherto

from her Councell, ment after to impart it to her Maiestie? These things and ma|nie such (howsoeuer smoothed ouer<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reade the chronicles.</NOTE> with a faire shewe) haue been commit|ted by vnnaturall subiects, since her Ma|iesties raigne, that our very enemies for the state of our countrie, could by no meanes possible haue deserued worse. And howsoeuer the lawe tearme them, not enemies, but simplie as rebels and seditious to their owne countrie, yet they ought not to be honored with the name of peace, nor as subiects any way to be made partakers thereof, vnles the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mercy vn|deserued.</NOTE> infinitly ouerflowing mercie of their Prince vouchsafe them (vndeserued) so<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace to ene|mies but not to traytors.</NOTE> great a fauour.

testifie of the like when trayterous sub|iects vndeseruedly (giue mee leaue to tearme them by that name) haue been so mightie to withstand the King, that he hath sent without co~trolling tearms as to an open enemie: <HI>England</HI> hath not now (and I happilie wish, as I hope it ne|uer shall) any cause to deale in the like manner.
