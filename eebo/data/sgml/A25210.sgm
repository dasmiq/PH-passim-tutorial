<P>TO believe the Thankfulness of our Hearts, beyond any Expres|sions of our Lips or Pens, for Your most Gracious <HI>Declaration</HI> for <HI>Liberty</HI> for us, in the Worship of <HI>God,</HI> which we trust we shall ever value above our <HI>Property,</HI> as that without which we could enjoy nothing which we could call our own, without the greatest un|easiness imaginable: But Your Maje|sty having in the same <HI>Declaration</HI> also secured that unto us, both by Your

<HEAD>THE Kings Answer.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> Have already found two good Effects of my <HI>Declaration</HI>; the Easing and, Pleasing My Subjects You spake of, and My restoring to God the Empire over <HI>Conscience</HI>: It has been my Iudgment a long time, that none Has or ought to Have any power over the <HI>Conscience</HI> but God. I understand there are some Iealousies a+mong my Subjects, That I have done this in a Design: But you look like Gentle|men
<PB N="8" REF="5">
of too great Ingenuity to entertain any such Suspition.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI> I protest before God, and I desire you to tell all manner of People of all Persuasions, as you have opportunity to Converse with them, that I have no other Design than that I have spoke of.</P>
<P>And <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> I hope to live to see the Day when you shall as well have <HI>Magna Charta</HI> for the <HI>Liberty of Con|science,</HI> as you have had for your Pro|perties.</P>
<P>And now <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> do You so Preach to Your Hearers as they may be good Christians, and then I do not question but they will be good Subjects.</P>
