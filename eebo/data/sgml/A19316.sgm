<HEAD>THE CAVLD SPRING
OF KINGHORNE CRAIG
HIS ADMIRABLE AND NEW
tryed properties, so far as yet are found
true by experience.</HEAD>
<P>_HARD by the shore syde of <HI>King|horne,</HI>
within a bow-draught or
more to the heaven of <HI>Prettie-cur</HI>
where the Botes arriue, direct
west the Sands, is a great round
steip Rock, whose fore-front ly|ing
so oppen to the Sea, and opposite to the wea|ther,
is so beatten therewith, as that his superficiall
parts are become so friable, and as it were rotten to
everie light twitching of ones hand.</P>
<P>All this whole craig from the top to the foun|dation,
is so seamed, and as it wer embroydered with
a number of whyte veines much resembling a soft
&amp; bruckle <HI>Alabast,</HI> &amp; in many places glau~cing in the
night, not vnlyk to <HI>Cristall</HI> or some bastard <HI>Diama~t.</HI></P>
<P>This white spar is accompanied (although but
poore) with some mixture of sundrie starnie metalls,
whereof the greatest pieces aboundes of a certaine
glauncing, cleir, &amp; skelflie stone called <HI>Gypsum,</HI> wel
<PB REF="4">
knowne of the <HI>Apothecareis,</HI> yea and is verie pon|derous
and weghtie.</P>
<P>Upon the east syde of the same Rock, in a hol|low
corner is perceived a certaine white cleir congea+led
water snotting through the moyst clifts of the
Craig&punc; much resembling the geile of fishe, or repre|senting
the stryne of ane evill rosted egge, called
of those who are skilfull in metalles, <HI>Sperma, seu ma|ter
Metallorum.</HI></P>
<P>&rindx; Out of the broade face of this foresaid Rock,
springs most plesandly a verie cleir, &amp; delicate cauld
<HI>VVater,</HI> which being drunk in great measure is neuer
for all that, felt in the belly.</P>
<P>This faire Spring (albeit but laitlie knowne) is
approved by the people which drink thereof, to be
one of the most rare remedies for the <HI>Stomach</HI> in
the world, gives a good appetit to meate, maketh
one that loaths of his meate to be hungrie, and is
the onlie remedie for <HI>Chronick,</HI> &amp; lingring disseases,
specialie in those who having spoilled their stomach
by superfluous drying of Cuppes.</P>
<P>It is a most confortable &amp; refreshing drink in all
hote fevers, pestilential agues, &amp; where drouth most
abounds.</P>
<P>It refresheth and cooleth a hott distemper of ye
<HI>Lever,</HI> helpes all disseases proceeding therethrough,
dryeth vp the <HI>Youk,</HI> and vniversall <HI>Skab,</HI> purgeth &amp;
correcteth all salt flegme, abaiteth and tempereth
the heat of the <HI>Reines,</HI> a great cause of confirmed
stones: and is a most soveraine remedie for the pai|nes
<PB REF="4">
of the <HI>Back,</HI> proceeding of <HI>Gravell</HI> or sand, cau|sing
the patient to pisse out many small stones, and
making them to discend without paine.</P>
<P>To some it louseth the belly verie freelie, but not
at the first. Others thinks it bindeth them. Yet it see|meth
to louse moe then it bindeth.</P>
<P>I haue knowne some vomit therewith, but that
I suspect proceedeth of surfet: for that the people
doe as yet vse it, without rule or praescription.</P>
<P>It helpeth many that haue a dimme <HI>Sight,</HI> for being
wel put in the eyes, it is more sharpe and byting the~
commoun water; &amp; is a singular remedie for those
which are molested with <HI>Lippitudo</HI> or bleir-eyed, &amp;
stayeth <HI>itching</HI> and <HI>heat.</HI></P>
<P>No liquor hath been tryed more excellent for
itching, and heat of the face with plouks, &amp; pustuls
then this water, it being both drunck and put ther|vpon.
And is also good for singing of the eares.</P>
<P>It is powerfull in helping extenuat and leane per|sons
who are troubled with difficultie of drawing
their <HI>Brath:</HI> gives vigour and strength to vithered
and debilitat members; and is the onlie last remedie
for all debilities which haue long vexed the body
through a hote distemper of the Lever, such as a hote
<HI>Gutte;</HI> it allayeth all <HI>Inflamations</HI> inward &amp; outward.</P>
<P><HI>Guarisce encora il cancaro, i caruoli, i porri fighi
della verga, &amp; la scolatione virolenta di rene, Ambas|ciatori
certi del mal Francese, ma non val niente a i
tenconi, overo panochie nell inguinaglia.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>geallie</HI> water, that sweateth out of the craig
<PB REF="5">
coolleth &amp; dryeth being gathered at tymes when it
falleth, and the hands &amp; face rubbed therwith, doth
procure a verie faire &amp; beautiefull skinne.</P>
<P>These bee the Physical properties of this faire
Spring, so far foorth as the disseased haue as yet tryed
by experience, &amp; in whose companie I was somtimes
present my selfe.</P>
<P>Now, what should bee the Physicall and naturall
cause of those wonderfull effects, diverse of the lear+ned
are of diverse judgments. For my owne part,
because I was the first of my profession that crossed
the Forh to that Spring, being moved partlie to sa|tisfie
the desire of my freinds and acquaintence, &amp;
partlie to content my owne curiositie in naturall
things, wherunto from my youth I haue euer bein
bent, as weell at home as abroad: I will onlie write
my opinioun without contentioun, reserving the
resolution thereof to my most learned colleagues,
much more judicious than my selfe.</P>
<P>I, at the first, as also many others, thought it but
ane idle toy, &amp; a conceit of the people, and as some
think it yet. Others, thought it a trick devysed by the
Ferriers onlie for gaine. But seeing the fame there|of
incresse and that not by the meanest, but euen
of those of best credit, who long disseased, wonder|fullie
recovered their vnexpected health in their
owne persons. At length I begoud to think that al|beit
it was no vncouth thing in others countreyes
to haue such minerall waters, yet rare &amp; but of laite
knowne amongst vs. And althogh I call this a mi|nerall
<PB REF="5">
water: yet my meaning is not to conclude that
it proceedeth of metall alone: for that as appeareth is
very poore in this craige: Notwithstanding that al
those riches of goulde and silver which are come
into <HI>Spaine</HI> since the west <HI>Indies</HI> were discovered,
haue beine drawne out of such barrane places which
are full beare and fruitles, as this rotten rock seims
to bee. Yea all the ponderous spar inclyneth rather
towards the bottome, a signe doutles which argueth
no rich metall.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ioseph Acesta</HI> Hist. natur. and Moral. <HI>Lib. 3. Cap.</HI> 3.</NOTE> <HI>For it is found be experience that where
minerals are most ryfe, the higher the veines bee to
the superfice of the earth, the more rich they find it,
and the deiper it goeth, the poorer it is.</HI></P>
<P>Further, if this water produce such Physicall pro|perties
be reason of metals, Then all springs taking
their course through the richest metals should far
excell this, which runneth but through a verie poor
metall by appearence: yea that wholsome &amp; cauld
spring of the brayes of <HI>Arthrey,</HI> perteining to the
right honourable The Earle of <HI>Montrose</HI> should far
excell this of <HI>Kinghorne.</HI> I haue drunk of both wa+ters,
and in my opinion the one, might by the like
tryall prove as good as the other, &amp; perhaps better.</P>
<P>For there, (no doubt) is a riche metall whose
seame and greate bodie reacheth directlie vpward
to the superfice of the mountaine, and there visi|blie
vncovers it selfe towards the South, the seame
whereof is neere a foot and ane halfe in breadth, &amp;
consisteth in my judgement of <HI>Iron, Copper,</HI> and
<HI>Vitrioll,</HI> and no doubt of some <HI>Silver,</HI> accompanied
<PB REF="6">
also with aboundance of a weghtie whyte spar, to|gidder
with that glancing and emplastie stone cal|led
<HI>Gypsum,</HI> verie vsuall amongst the learned for
externall ruptures: which minerall spring (for no
doubt it is one amongst diverse others in this land)
if it ran as pleasandlie from the Rock as that of <HI>Kin|ghorne,</HI>
would be in as great request ere it were long.</P>
<P>I must confesse that all springs having their course
through sto~nie grounds and rocks, minerals &amp; privie
veines of the earth, cannot but contract &amp; participat
of one Phisicall qualitie or other, resembling the
nature of the mettall through which it runneth.</P>
<P>Neither needeth any man of solid judgement to
doubt, but that all springs of water taking their ishue
and race through a hard rock, are to be preferred to
any other water, taking way throgh a muddie earth:
so consequentlie all springs passing through a mi|nerall
Rock, (by reason) must farre excell that of no
minerall, I meane for curing of disseases: for such
waters are no wayes fit for dressing of meates, much
lesse to bee mixed with wine, because no minerall
water feedeth the bodie.</P>
<P>Now that mettals haue beene of old used for phy|sick,
&amp; yet are wonderfull in curing disseases, is no
new thing, as lykewise the infinite works of lear|ned
Physitions yet extant doe testifie.</P>
<P>For <HI>Iron,</HI> or <HI>Steell</HI> rightly prepared, then mixed
either in liquid or solid forme, and given at con|venient
houres, and tymes, after due preparation of
the bodie, opneth all obstructions, opilations, &amp; stop|pings
<PB REF="6">
of the noble parts, <HI>speciallie when the meseraick
veines,</HI> betwix the <HI>Lever, gall</HI> &amp; <HI>splen,</HI> are stuffed with
a tuich, gla<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">use &amp; vilccus flegme: and is a most so|veraine
medecin, recomended of all the learned by
long experience, for the vnplesand <HI>peale coloures</HI> in
virgins, and other such lyke whatsomever, either in
widowes or maried wyfes. <HI>Iron,</HI> or <HI>Steell</HI> haue also
power to stop the <HI>Lask</HI> or <HI>Dysenterie</HI> and to heale
inward <HI>Apostumes.</HI> And what I haue said of <HI>Iron</HI> or
<HI>Steel,</HI> the lyke effects are to bee vnderstude of all
springing waters running through the same.</P>
<P>Springes of <HI>Vitrioll,</HI> helpes too greate moysture
of the <HI>Stomach,</HI> being moderatlie vsed stayes <HI>Nau|sea</HI>
a continuall preasse to vomite, and vomiting it
selfe: but being vsed in larger measure, provoketh
vomite, and cleingeth the <HI>Stomach</HI> of whatsomever
noysome humors. It healeth <HI>Stranguria,</HI> a painefull
and faschious dissease, when one cannot pish but by
drope and drope.</P>
<P>Springes of <HI>Silver,</HI> doe coole and drye.</P>
<P>Springs of <HI>Bruntstone</HI> are hote and whytish, smel|ling
thereof, and the water boyleth hote. They ease
cold disseases, heats the sinewes, consume humors
betwix the skinne and the flesh. They cure the host.
Helpe those who haue the falling siknesse, Heale
scabbes, resiste venome, awaik men of the sleeping
evill, and doe helpe the Gutt and Palsie. They cure
inveterat vlcers, the hardnes of the Melt, Lever, and
Matrice. But Springs of <HI>Bruntstone</HI> be not good for
the Stomach.</P>
<P><PB REF="7">
<HI>Brassie</HI> Springs are not so wholsome, but they are
good for disseases of the eyes, vlcers of the mouth,
palate, or rufe thereof.</P>
<P><HI>Copper</HI> Springs are good for dolors of the <HI>Gutte,
short Braith,</HI> doloures of the <HI>Reins,</HI> and doe heale
<HI>Vlcers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Alume</HI> Springs, doe stay the <HI>spitting of Blood,</HI> stay
<HI>Vomiting,</HI> stoppes immoderat flowing of the <HI>Hemor|rhoides,</HI>
and hinders weomen to part with Chyld.</P>
<P>Springs of <HI>Tinne</HI> or <HI>Lead,</HI> doe heale all cancerous
<HI>Vlcers, Schirrs</HI> or hard <HI>Tumoures,</HI> and are most pro|per
for all disseases of the <HI>Skinne.</HI></P>
<P>That <HI>Tinne</HI> or <HI>Lead</HI> be in this craig I greatlie dout,
because <HI>Tinne</HI> nor <HI>Lead</HI> worke no such effects as this
water doeth, neither are they so wholsome taken
inwardlie as are any of the other, notwithstanding
their cooling and detersive qualities externalie vsed,
wherein verely they wo~derfully excell. And althogh
it hath beene ane old custome to make springes of
water runne through spoutes of Lead, &amp; that Tin
bee lesse hurtfull, yea, neerer the qualitie of Silver,
Yet neither Tin nor Lead are vsuallie taken at the
mouth, as most of other metals bee, graunting that
it participat some-what of <HI>Mercurie,</HI> whereof it is
never a graine the better, but rather the more per|nicious
for this pourpose.</P>
<P>Heurnius <HI>a man of great experience,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Institut. Med.</NOTE> <HI>thoght never

where ever one mettall is found, there is also some o|ther

<P>Now because (as I said before) the scaircetie of
this metall (as appeareth) is not liklie to commu|nicate
such Physicall faculties to this water alone,
without some more helpe than the metall. What
then? I take it to bee rather a kynd of doulce <HI>Ni|truse</HI>
&amp; semi-minerall mixture, wherwith these <HI>Cry|stalline</HI>

<P>Morover, common water tempereth great heat,
and conserveth the naturall humiditie of the body:
for which cause <HI>Hippocrates</HI> calleth water, the bodies
temper. And auncient histories sufficientlie testifie,
that water was the first drinck that men vniuersalie
vsed of old, &amp; wherewith they contented them selues
a long tyme, to vse it onlie for quenshing of their
thirst&punc; but afterwards when voluptuousnes seased
vpon mens appetites, they invented &amp; set before
them diuerse sorts of drincks, because they thoght
water but a taistles and vnsavorie thing. And yet if
wee will giue credite to experience and heare but
what the writes of the learned doe say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">. a Fon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> Lusitan. de tuend. valetu. Cap. 12.</NOTE> <HI>That water

a dayes hath no eares for such grammer rules. And
yet to speake the truth; cold water is as vnfit for a wo|man
with childe and for such as are accustomed with
frequent birth, as strong wine is vnmixed.</P>
<P>Then seing that co~moun water, either cold or
hote, hath such evident, and <HI>anodine</HI> properties:
what shall wee thinck of the best sort of these wa|ters
correspondent in all respects to the true nottes
which <HI>Dioscorides</HI> hath left vnto vs? and what ac|compt
shall wee make of this crystalline or semi|minerall
water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 5. cap. 9.</NOTE> which not onlie is answerable <HI>om|ni-modo</HI>
to the best? but also excelleth so far footth
as the qualities of these forsaid mixtures may mak it.</P>
<P>But to returne to our purpose concerning <HI>Niter.</HI>
Who then thincks that these <HI>Nitrous</HI> qualities, for
the most part doe not agree competentli with this
faire Spring; hath not well remarcked the obser|vations
of the disseased: for how oppenlie is it known
to expell sand, and bring doune small stones both
from the reines and bladder, to coole the heate of
the back, burning of the vrine, and to aswage all pai|nes
thereabout? experience of the people can testi|fie,
and which <HI>aperitiue</HI> and <HI>diuretick</HI> power belon|geth
both to <HI>Crystall,</HI> and <HI>Niter.</HI> I haue knowne
it to helpe <HI>Sciatick</HI> dolours given warme in a Cly|ster
with Salt. To helpe sore eyes, clenge a dimme
sight, to aswage the paines and singing of the eares,
and to scoure them from filth: all which doe well
<PB REF="13">
aggree with <HI>Niter.</HI> It helpeth the dolour of the head
drawen vp as an <HI>Errhin</HI> at the nose, &amp; clengeth the
teeth more then co~moun water, maketh the haire
faire and cleene, healeth a reiffie and leprouse skine,
and in a word, maketh even Ladyes faire.</P>
<P>Why may not then, I say, such detersiue and scou|ring
qualities appeare rather to proceed of a drying
and saltish <HI>Nitrositie,</HI> than of any apparent mettall
in that place; in respect it not onlie purgeth, and
clengeth the bodie, as well inward as outward, but
also clengeth and purgeth tasches and spottes, both
from linning &amp; wollen, and which detersive power
doeth more agree with the vse of <HI>Niter,</HI> than with
any metall that can bee found in a Rock.</P>
<P><HI>Monavius</HI> ane expert and learned Physition wri|ting
of the qualities of Salt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Epist. med. Craton. 215.</NOTE> sayeth thus: <HI>Salem (in

corpus sumpta, sed &amp; extra admota, praeter experien|tiam
quotidianam in eluendis sordium strigmentis, etia~
vnanimis medicorum consensus testatur.</HI> The which
also the holie Scripture approveth by the mouth of
the Prophet saying, <HI>Etiamsi laveris te nitro, &amp; mul|tiplicaueris
tibi herbam Borith, tamen signata est ini|quitas
tua</HI> &amp;c.<NOTE PLACE="marg">I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters">. cap. 2. Saponaria.</NOTE></P>
<P>But which is worse of all, I heare it hath swelled
the bellie of <HI>Cacochymick</HI> and vnwholsome people,
and stopped their water: So doeth <HI>Niter</HI> take~ before
the bodie bee well prepared and purged. And hath
it done good to one, and evill to another? So will
any good thing doe, (although good in it selfe) if
<PB REF="14">
it bee not vsed with rule and moderation&punc; yea &amp; to
some also, <HI>one man's meate is another man's poyson,</HI>
a proverb co~moun amongst vs.</P>
<P>And hath it constipat some, and loosed others?
No wonder, for the Spring is possessed with con|trarie
qualities, a vertue proper to best medecines:
for if it did not bind, it could not helpe the lask &amp;
<HI>Dysenterie:</HI> And if it did not loose, it could not re|moue
their causes. Hath it not cured some without
preparation, and others which Physitions could not
cure? let them thank GOD and sing, <HI>Te Deum lau|damus:
Vna enim Hyrundo non facit ver:</HI> Then blesse
the Spring with a famous report, and say, <HI>Beatus
medicus qui venit in fine morbi.</HI></P>
<P>Then to conclude, I perceiue my verie lerned frend
and old Parisien acquentance <HI>M^r VVilliam Barclay,</HI>
wold haue all the effects of this water to proceede
from <HI>Tinne:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fallop. de foss. atque metal. cap. 22.</NOTE> which effects, sayeth hee, the <HI>Paracel|sians
ascryue to Saturne,</HI> and so concludeth, <HI>Sacha|rum
Saturni</HI> to bee the Salt of <HI>Tinne,</HI> confounding
two metalls in one, as if <HI>Iupiter</HI> were <HI>Saturne,</HI> and
<HI>Saturne Iupiter: Stannnm Plumbum,</HI> and <HI>plumbum
stannum.</HI> Tinne to bee Lead, and Lead to be Tin,
Which ouersight I can not think to haue proceided
of ignorance, because I know him to bee more ler|ned
than my selfe. I suspect it may bee imputed to
his haist (as hee writeth to the Printer) in making
for the tyde. Or else it may bee that hee thinketh
the difference betwix <HI>stannum</HI> &amp; <HI>plumbum</HI> to bee so
litle, that <HI>propter similitudinem in ardore scribendi,</HI> hee
<PB REF="14">
might vse the name of the one for the other without
scruple, because of their affinitie; which if so bee, as
it is liklie, I think there is no oversight at all.</P>
<P>Finalie amongst all the wholsum qualities where
with this water seemeth to bee so secreitlie indued,
the corroboration of the <HI>Stomach</HI> is not the least:
a great ayde in curing of all disseases, and a power
so oppenlie knowne in this water to steir vp lust to
meate, that few or none haue as yet retourned with

<P>But that Springs taking their course through <HI>Tin</HI>

remarked such a thing. For <HI>Fuschius</HI> the most lear|ned

<P>How then can it bee any thing, but a detersiue &amp;

Now because that some may object: if this water

warrand of the learned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap. 9. de Therm. atque Metallis.</NOTE> Heare what <HI>Fallopius</HI> say|eth
of this same subject: <HI>Nitrum quidem ipsum, gustu
cognoscitur: difficile tamen est ex gustu discernere, an
aqua habeat in se Nitrum, quia Nitri sapor in ejusmo|di
aquis frigidis, non discernitur. Item visu nec olfactu
vllo modo cognoscitur aquam habere Nitrum. Tactu au|tem
aliquo modo, quia aquae Nitrosae detergunt nec re|linquunt
aliquam asperitatem.</HI></P>
<P>Againe hee sayeth in an other place:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Idem.</NOTE> <HI>Saepe enim
Sal</HI> &amp; <HI>Alumen sunt cum aquis ita commixta vt im|possile
sit per dissolutionem naturalem ipsa cognoscere.
Item Nitrum non cognscimus in aliqua aqua esse, nisi

<P>To bee short then let none think, but Springs of
waters may bee indued with diverse Physicall pro|perties,
minerall or semi-minerall qualities, althogh
they nether bewray them selfes in taist, colour, nor
savour.</P>
<P>But how the, say others, can waters possessed
<PB REF="16">
with saltish and <HI>Nitrous</HI> faculties, refresh, moysten,
and coole? I answer that a thousand effects in na|turall
causes, may also proceed of co~trarie qualities:
for there be many exceptions even in naturall rules,
so that sometymes wee see by experience subtile na|ture
so to ouerreach and surpasse the skill of arte
in these kynds of mixtures, that simples, natuallie
hote &amp; dry of them selfes, by the companie of others
which coole and refresh, are sensiblie felt to excute
colde ffects.</P>
<P><HI>Iosephus Acosta</HI> a worthie and judicious Spanyard
in his naturall and morall historie which he writeth
of the East and West <HI>Indies,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap. 11, Natur Hist.</NOTE> discoursing vpon the
naturall qualitie of the Sea, writteth in these termes:
Althogh, sayeth hee, the water bee salt, yet it is al|wayes
water, whose nature is ever to coole, and it
is a remarkable thing in nature, that in the midst
of the deepe of the Oceane, the water is not made
hote, by the violent heat of the Sunne, as in rivers:
even as <HI>Salpeter</HI> (sayeth hee) althogh it bee natu|rallie
salt) hath a propertie to coole water, even so
wee see by experience, that in some ports and hea|vens,
the salt water refresheth, which wee haue ob|served
in that of <HI>Callao</HI> in <HI>Peru,</HI> whereas they put
the water or wyne which they drinck into the Sea
in flaggons to bee refreshed, whereby wee may vn|doubtedlie
beleeue, that the Ocean hath this pro|pertie,
to temper and moderat the excessiue heate:
for this cause wee find greater heat at land then at
sea, (<HI>caeteris paribus</HI>) and co~monlie countryes lying
<PB REF="16">
neere the Sea, ar colder the~ those that ar foorther off.</P>
<P>But to illustrat this by many examples, wer no
lesse needlesse then endlesse: for the mater is cleer
of it selfe: and therefore I will ende this colde
discourse, contenting me onlie with the experience
of that famous &amp; learned Empyrick <HI>Rulandus</HI> in
his tract at which hee writeth <HI>de curatione luis Hun|garicoe,</HI>
whose words are these: <HI>Inflamationi inquit,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap. 6.</NOTE>

<HEAD>TO THE COURTEOUS READER.</HEAD>
<P>_GEntle Reader, this Discourse hath beene the
birth of my Idle houres this last vacance, which
I penned more for your particular vse, then
for any gaine to my selfe. If you haue found
any thing heerein to your content, think well of the Au|thor
for his paines. If nothing which you haue red hath ly|ked
you, my luck hath beene naught: for in nothing, there
can bee no great thing. An other before me hath writen
his opinion, and so haue I. if I haue erred &amp; said amisse,
I am but a man. If not well ynough, I wish it were bet|ter.
But if well and truelie, GOD bee praised, I deserue
no blame. I haue done offence to none, but showne
my mynd, for the which I craue no man pardon, nor fur|ther
freindship then I deserue, nor greater thankes then
may requyte goodwill, who wisheth well to you all that
are well mynded, crauing onlie your courtesie to comend
what yee think worthie, and not to disdaine without de|sert.
So if I haue offended in any thing that the wyse can
mislyke, I am reddie to make a mends accordinglie, and
shall Godwilling drinck to you at the Well the nixt So|mer,
with a promesse also to doe you greater service heir
after, and so I end.</P>
