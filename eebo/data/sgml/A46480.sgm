<P>RIght Trusty and Right Well-beloved Cousin and Counsellor, Right Trusty

Cousins and Counsellors, Right Trusty and Right Well-beloved Cousins
and Counsellors, Right Trusty and Well-beloved Cousins and Counsellors, Right
Trusty and Well-beloved Counsellors, and Trusty and Well-beloved Counsel|lors,
We Greet you well. Whereas by Our Letter of the 21<HI>st</HI> of <HI>August</HI> last past,
We were graciously pleased to inform you of Our Designs in order to the Ease
of Our <HI>Roman Catholick Subjects,</HI> unto which we had your Dutiful Answer in
some days thereafter; We have now thought fit to Publish these Our Roy|al
Intentions, and to give an Additional Ease to those of Tender Conscien|ces,
so to convince the World of Our Inclinations to Moderation, and to e|vidence
that those of the Clergy who have been Regular, are Our most particular
Care; though We have given some Ease to those Principles, We can with
any Safety Trust: We have at the same time expressed Our highest In|dignation
against those Enemies of Christianity, as well as Government, and
Humane Society, <HI>The Field Conventiclers,</HI> whom We recommend to you to
Root out with all the Severities of Our Laws, and with the most vigorous
Prosecution of Our Forces, it being equally Our, and Our Peopl's concern,
to be rid of them. As for the other Particulars of Our Royal Proclamation
here inclosed, We doubt not but they will appear to you most Just and
Reasonable, as they do to Us, and that you will, in your respective Capacities
Assert, and Defend Our Royal Rights and Prerogatives, which We are re|solved
to maintain in that Splendor and Greatness, which can only make them
Safe for Us, Supports for Our Friends, and Terrors to Our Enemies. It is
evident, We do not mean to encroach on the Consciences of any, and what
We will not do, We are resolved not to suffer in others: And therefore it is
Our Will and Pleasure, That these Our Commands be forth-with obeyed,
and that in Order thereunto, this Our Proclamation be forth-with Printed and
Published in the usual manner in such Cases accustomed; And if any shal be so
bold as to shew any dislike of this Our Procedour, We desire to be inform|ed
thereof by you, To the end We may convince the World, that We are in
Earnest, assuring all, That as We expect Obedience therein, and a Readiness
from you, and all Our Judicatures to assert Our Rights, so it shall be Our
Care on all Occasions, to shew Our Royal Favour to all of you in General,
and to every one in Particular. For doing all these things, as well contained
in this Our Letter, as in Our Proclamation aforesaid, These Presents shall be to
you, and all others respectively, who may be therein any way concerned, a
sufficient Warrant. and so We bid you Heartily Farewell.</P>

<P>YOur Majesties Commands are exactly Obeyed. Your Royal Procla|mation
is Printed and Published, by which Your Majesty hath gi|ven
a further Evidence of your Favour and Goodness to all Your Sub|jects.

Mercy to some, who have been too ready on many Occasions to abuse the
Clemency of Your Royal Predecessors, they will be at last convinced what
they owe to so Gracious a King; And if any shal be still so obstinate as to
make any wrong use of Your Majesties Goodness, We do unanimously assure
Your Majesty, That we will maintain and assert Your Royal Prerogatives and
Authority with the hazard of our Lives and Fortunes; And all of us shall
in our several Capacities do our Utmost, that Your Government may be easie
to all, whom Your Majesty thinks worthy of Your Protection.</P>
<P>We are very willing that Your Majesties Subjects who are Peaceable and
Loyal, may be at Ease and Security, notwithstanding of their Profession and
Private Worship, and do conceive that such of them as are or shall be employ|ed
by Your Majesty in Offices of Trust Civil or Military, are sufficiently se|cured
by Your Majesties Authority and Commission for their exercing the
same.</P>
<P>We return Your Majesty our most humble Thanks for giving Us Your Roy|al
Word for maintaining the Church and our Religion, as it is now established
by Law, and rest satisfied, believing Your Majesties Promise to be the best
and greatest Security we can have. We are,</P>
