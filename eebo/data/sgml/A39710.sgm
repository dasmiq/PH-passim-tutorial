<HEAD>THE
Epistle Dedicatory,
To all his
NOBLE FRIENDS.</HEAD>
<P>THere is none Prints
more, nor publishes less
than I; for I Print one|ly
for my self and pri|vate
Friends (and had
I not thought these more passible than
the rest, I had never made them so
publick as I do.)</P>
<P>I write chiefly to avoid Idleness,
and print to avoid the Imputation:
and as others do it to live after they
are dead; I do it onely not to be
thought dead whilst I am a live: (for
as the concealing what one does, little
differs from <HI>Idleness,</HI> so the being <HI>I|dle,</HI>
<PB REF="3">
little differs from being <HI>dead.</HI>)</P>
<P><HI>Epigram</HI> in general, is a quick
and short kinde of Writing, rather a
<HI>slight,</HI> than any great force of the
<HI>Spirit;</HI> and therefore the more fit for
me, who <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> not to take pains in any
thing, and rather affect a <HI>little neg|ligence,</HI>
than <HI>too great curiosity</HI>
(which I desire may serve for excuse
of my negligence in some of these.)</P>
<P><HI>Epigrams</HI> at their first institution
served onely for Inscriptions of
<HI>Ports,</HI> and <HI>Entries</HI> of <HI>Temples,</HI> and
<HI>publick places,</HI> and consisted onely
in a <HI>Distick,</HI> or <HI>line or two;</HI> till at
length, by degrees, they became so much
enlarg'd, both for <HI>matter</HI> and <HI>quain|tity,</HI>
as there was nothing that was
not matter of <HI>Epigram,</HI> and no
length it woud not admit of, so it
kept but close unto the matter, with
that l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">se and quickness which was Re|quisite
and essential to it; and espe|cially
a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">oided long discourses, which
is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> improper for it, as a long Robe
for one who is to run a Race.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">
For these here, they are chiefly in
praise of worthy persons, of which none
had ever a more plentiful subject than
I, having been always conversant with
the best and worthiest in all places
where I came; and amongst the rest
with Ladies, in whose conversation,
as in an <HI>Academy</HI> of <HI>Vertue,</HI> I
learnt nothing but <HI>Goodness,</HI> saw
nothing but <HI>nobleness;</HI> and one might
as well be drunk in a Christial Foun|tain,
as have any evil thoughts whilst
they were in their Company. Which
I shall gladly always remember, as
the happiest and innocentest part of
all my life; and that they are mixt
with the dispraise of others, 'tis one|ly
as <HI>sawce</HI> unto the rest, which shud
always have somewhat of sharp
piquant in it.</P>
<P>I was long deliberating before I
publisht them, whether I shud range
them in order, or let them pass pro|misculously,
till at last (to save the
<HI>Heralds</HI> labour) I resolv'd on this
latter way, onely I have separated
<PB REF="4">
the more <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Theatical</HI> ones,
and the more <HI>Grave</HI> and <HI>Pious</HI> ones
from the rest, as being particularly
subjects of themselves.</P>
<P>Of which <HI>Pious</HI> ones, this I will
onely say, that <HI>Piety</HI> and <HI>Devtion,</HI>
Consisting chiefly in moving the <HI>Af|fection,
Verse</HI> seems the fittest lan|guage
for it, and of all <HI>Verse,</HI> that of
<HI>Epigrams:</HI> it being a short <HI>Jaculatory,</HI>
kinde of writing, and therefore the
aptest to penetrate the brest, it is that
which strews the way of <HI>Vertue</HI> and
<HI>Piety</HI> with <HI>Roses</HI> insteed of <HI>Thorns:</HI>
and one reason why no more are de|lighted
with it, is because it is no
more delightfully perswaded; and
then it was when <HI>Verse</HI> was wholly
imployed in <HI>Devotion,</HI> that <HI>Poetry</HI>
was called the <HI>Language of the Gods,</HI>
your <HI>Poets, Prophets,</HI> and such as
<HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>David</HI> were <HI>Poets:</HI> nor
will it ever be well with the World,
till things return to their first insti|tution,
and <HI>Poets</HI> take as much pains
to render <HI>Piety</HI> and <HI>Vertue</HI> delight|ful,
<PB REF="4">
as now they do <HI>Vice</HI> and <HI>Impiety.</HI>
Whatsoever they are, they are yours,
for I have made them for you, and to
dedicate them to any one in particu|lar,
were to do injury to the rest, take
them amongst you then, for 'tis but
just, that I should Dedicate all I have
to you, to whom I have dedicated
my self.</P>

<P>You will finde many other rubs besides, to
hinder the Verses running smooth, which none
but a Friend can excuse; aud I shud be sorry
they shud light into any other hands.</P>
