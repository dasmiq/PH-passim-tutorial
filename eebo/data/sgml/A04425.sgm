<P>_GEntle <HI>Reader,</HI> if thou thinkest the <HI>Preacher</HI> of this <HI>Sermon,</HI> was vppon purpose appointed to relate the discouery of this late <HI>Tragi-comical treason,</HI> (<HI>Tra|gical,</HI> in the dreadeful intention: <HI>Comicall</HI> in the happye and timely <HI>Detection</HI> thereof) thou art drceiued: but be|ing three weekes before requested, to supply the roome amongst other <HI>Bishops</HI> for the <HI>Parliament,</HI> if it had continued: this <HI>occurrent</HI> happened in the <HI>interim</HI> some foure or fiue dayes before the <HI>Sabboth,</HI> wherein he was to <HI>Preach,</HI> whereby he thought it fit, (though he had purposed a <HI>Scripture</HI> of that day for his Text) to change a <HI>Gospel</HI> into a <HI>Psalme:</HI> which notwith|standing, albeit out of the <HI>Psalmes,</HI> may well beare the name of <HI>Euangelium,</HI> not onely in respect of <HI>Dauid</HI> the <HI>Author</HI> (who writ more like an <HI>Euangelist</HI> then a <HI>Prophet,</HI> and therefore the <HI>Fathers</HI> conclude him to be&punc; <HI>Homo in veteri, non de veteri Testamento,</HI> a man that liued in the <HI>Time,</HI> but not after the <HI>Man|ner</HI>

<P>Great Deliuerances giueth he vnto his King, and sheweth mercy to his annointed <HI>Dauid,</HI> and to his seede for euer.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE whole Psalme, as the title sheweth, 2. <HI>Sam.</HI> 22.<HI>1.</HI> is <HI>Da|uids</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, or Tri|umphing Song, af|ter his many rescues and victories: and is one of those, which Psalme 32.7. he cal|leth <HI>Cantica liberati|onis,</HI> the Songes of Deliuerance: for it seemeth that God and <HI>Dauid</HI> had entred a couenant each with other, Psalme 89.2. ratified on each parte with an othe, God for his parte tooke his oath, Psalme 89.35. <HI>I haue sworn by my Holines, that I
<PB REF="5">
will neuer faile</HI> Dauid: <HI>Dauid</HI> againe for his parte sware vnto the Lord, Psalme&punc; 32.2. and vowed a vow vnto the Almighty, not to cease day &amp; night, to performe all meanes for the setting foorth of Gods prayses, &amp; of that vow, this book of Psalmes is an euerlasting witnes. wherein he generaly verifieth, what in one place he spake <HI>de te Canticum meum semper</HI>&punc; Psalm 71.8. <HI>My song shall alwayes be of thee.</HI> In this, aboue the rest, hee inlargeth himselfe in that kinde, which hee be|ginneth with loue, <HI>I will loue thee most dearely O Lord my strength,</HI> verse 1. (for praises not issuing from a louing affection, are eyther <HI>Flatteries</HI> or <HI>Hypocrisies</HI>) and endeth verse 49. <HI>I will prayse thee O Lord among the Nations:</HI> (for benefites acknow|ledged, not ending with prayses to God, argue eyther a <HI>prophane ingratitude,</HI> or an <HI>arrogant pre|sumption.</HI>) Of both these, namely, his affection and acknowledgement, this verse is the <HI>Epipho|nema,</HI> or the closing blast of this triumphing <HI>Trumpet,</HI> wherein, as if hee wanted winde to sound out, by particular enumeration, all his seuerall <HI>Deliuerances,</HI> (for so himselfe confesseth, Psalme 40.5. <HI>Thy mercies exceede all account, I would declare them, and speake of them, but I am not able to expresse them</HI>:) therfore, as if this verse were the &amp;c. or <HI>totall summe</HI> of all the particular <HI>Items</HI> hee would haue you take this for all, <HI>Great deli|uerances, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="5">Which he setteth out, first <HI>intensiue,</HI> shewing what they are in their owne nature (<HI>magnificasti salutes</HI>) because petty benefices become not GOD to giue for Psalme 2.8. <HI>Aske of me,</HI> sai|eth hee, <HI>and I will giue thee</HI> no lesse then <HI>the Heathen to possesse, and thiue enemies to crush.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>extensiue,</HI> how these are diffu|sed or communicated (to <HI>Dauid</HI> and his seede) for GOD hoardeth not vppe his bles|singes but distributes them abroad, <HI>Iames 1.</HI>17. <HI>Euerie good gifte commeth downe from the Fa|ther.</HI></P>
<P>In the parte <HI>intensiue,</HI> concurre two partes; First, the double <HI>quantitie,</HI> both that which they call <HI>discreta,</HI> the pluralitie of the number [<HI>Deliuerances</HI>] as also that which they call <HI>con|tinua,</HI> the magnitude thereof [<HI>great</HI>&punc;] Secondly, the double qualitie, as well internall and essen|tiall [<HI>salutes, healthes, wholesome Deliuerances:</HI>] as outward and accidentall, [<HI>magnificasti</HI>] <HI>deliue|rances,</HI> beseeming a <HI>Great God</HI> whome Saint <HI>Ba|sil</HI> calleth <GAP DESC="foreign">, a most magni|ficent King.</P>
<P>The part extensiue, is personall and suc|cessiue, the <HI>Person</HI> [<HI>Dauid</HI>] First, as an eminent person [<HI>a King.</HI>] Secondly, as a sacred person [<HI>Annointed</HI>] Thirdly, as a person appropriate vnto <HI>God, [his King, his Annointed]</HI> The sucession indefinite and infinite, [<HI>vnto his seed</HI>] the number
<PB REF="6">
not defined [<HI>for euermore</HI>] the time not limited.</P>
<P>And both these generall partes, hee deriueth from these two qualities which God, by a rei|terated speech challengeth vnto himselfe aboue all other attributes. Psalme 62.11. <HI>Power vn|to God, and vnto thee, O Lorde, mercie,</HI> In the part Intensiue [<HI>great Deliuerances</HI>] there is Gods <HI>power,</HI> both <HI>Potentia virtutis,</HI> Ephes. 6.10. <HI>The po|wer of his might</HI> (for weakenes cannot make ma|nie rescues) then <HI>Potentia claritatis,</HI> Coloss. 1.11. <HI>The power of his glorie,</HI> [<HI>Magnificasti</HI>] for <HI>Gods De|liuerances</HI> cannot be obscured.</P>
<P>In the part Extensiue, there is Gods <HI>mercie</HI> [<HI>sheweth mercyes</HI>] First, that which is called, Luke, 1.78. <HI>Misericordia viscerum,</HI> his emboweled mercie, wherewith hee tenderly and speci|ally affected <HI>Dauid:</HI> For which cause, in the title of this Psalme, (as the Latines reade it) hee is called <HI>Puer Domini,</HI> the Lordes Darling, or tenderling, and so much himselfe confesseth 22. verse, <HI>Saluum me fecit quoniam voluit me,</HI> Because hee had a fauour vnto me. Second|ly, that which Diuines call, <HI>Misericordia facta,</HI> not onely affecting <HI>Dauid,</HI> but also acting and perfourming mercies vnto him (for so it is here, [<HI>Misericordiam faciens</HI>] dooing mercie vnto <HI>Dauid</HI>) Thirdly, that which the Scripture calleth <HI>Misericordia custodita,</HI> Exod. 34.7. His treasured mercy, <HI>Reseruing mercy for thousands, &amp;c.</HI>
<PB REF="6">
Not onely to <HI>Dauid,</HI> but lineally and laterally, [<HI>to his seed</HI>] and that [<HI>for euer</HI>] for many generati|ons.</P>
<P>These are the partes of this Scripture, the summe whereof is, that admiration of <HI>Dauid,</HI> Psalme 31.19. <HI>Qu&aacute;m magna multitudo dulcedinis tuae?</HI> There is the part Intensiue <HI>which thou hast done to them that feare thee, &amp;c.</HI> There is the parte extensiue. Of these in their order.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The first part.</HEAD>
<P>THe first part wee obserued, is the <HI>Pluralitie</HI> &amp; the <HI>Qualitie</HI> of these <HI>Deliuerances:</HI> they be <HI>plures,</HI> and they be <HI>salutes</HI>: both which with the Fathers, ye may call the two handes of God, vz. <HI>Latitude</HI> and <HI>Fortitude</HI>: the first in the plurali|tie, <HI>Giuing to all men,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, aboundantly, 1. Tim. 6.19. that is, <HI>Manus expansa</HI>: The second in the qualitie, defending what <HI>he giues</HI> powerful|ly, there is <HI>Manus extensa.</HI> Or in Saint <HI>Paules</HI> Me|taphor, <HI>The fulnesse of Gods riches.</HI> First, <HI>Diuitiae gratiae,</HI> Ephes. 1.17. Giuing frankely and libe|rally. Secondly, <HI>Diuitiae bonitatis,</HI> Roman. <HI>2.</HI>4 In that the thinges which he giueth, be [<HI>Salutes</HI>] For so it is, Mat. 7.11. Your heauenly Father shall giue vnto you <HI>bona,</HI> good thinges&punc; and this comes nearer to <HI>Dauids</HI> sense, who, when he me|ditates of his Deliuerances from God, still at|tributes
<PB REF="7">
them to <HI>Gods right hand.</HI> Psalme 73.<HI>23.</HI> I was alwayes with thee, and thou vpheldest me with <HI>thy right hand:</HI> but herein he obserueth two things: First, <HI>Plenitudo dextrae,</HI> Psalme 16.11. the plentie of that hand. Secondly, <HI>salutare dextrae,</HI> Psal. 20.6. the wholesomnesse of that hand. For the first vz. the pluralitie: it is not with God as <HI>Esau</HI> spake of his Father <HI>Isaac,</HI> Genes. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter">.38. <HI>Hast thou but ONE blessing my Father?</HI> As if God had but one way to saue, or as hee said, 1. Kings 20.23. that he were a God of the Mountaines onely, that is, coulde ridde vs from high &amp; e|minent daungers and not a God of the Valleis: (yes, and of the vaultes too we may say,) for with him, sayeth <HI>Dauid,</HI> there is <HI>copiosa redemp|tio,</HI> Psalm 131.7. all maner of wayes to redeem. And therfore as there being diuerse kinds of sinnes, and for euery of them he hath mercies answerable and proportionable&punc; an abilitie to redeeme <HI>Israel from all his sinnes.</HI> Psal. 131 8. as for great sinnes&punc; he hath <HI>magnam misericordiam,</HI> and for many sins, <HI>multitudinem miseria um.</HI> psal. 51.1 so proportionable to euery mans dangers, or miseries, are Gods deliuerances: Be they <HI>great</HI> as Psalme 71.20. <HI>great</HI> aduersities hast thou shew|ed vnto me, &amp;c. Behold here <HI>Great deliuerances,</HI> Are they <HI>Many</HI>? as Psalme 25&punc; 17. <HI>Tribu|lationes multiplicasti,</HI> my sorrowes are multipli|ed, there is with him, <HI>Multitudo salutum,</HI> Ps. 94
<PB REF="7">
19. In the <HI>Multitude</HI> of the sorrows which I had in my heart, thy comfortes haue refreshed mee: Particularly, to fore-prise a daunger, hee hath <HI>Salutem praeuenientem,</HI> Psalme 21.3. Thou diddest <HI>preuent</HI> me with thy goodnesse, to meete with a daunger when it commeth, hee hath <HI>Salutem praeparantem,</HI> Psalme 18, 43. Thou diddest <HI>Girde</HI> mee with strength vnto the battle, to assist at a pinch in the daunger, hee hath <HI>salutem suscipi|entem,</HI> Psalme 118.13. I was thrust at sore that I might fall <HI>sed Dominus suscepit me,</HI> but the Lorde <HI>vphelde me,</HI> to stay a relapse after an escaped dan|ger, hee hath <HI>salutem confortantem,</HI> Psalme 89.21. My hand shall <HI>holde him vppe,</HI> and my arme shall <HI>stablish</HI> him. And this pluralitie might <HI>Da|uid</HI> aboue all others acknowledge, and so he did, when Psalm 118.14. he confessed, that God had so many wayes deliuered him, <HI>Vt totus factus esset in salutem,</HI> as if hee intended nothing else but to deliuer him: For <HI>Salus</HI> beeing eyther <HI>Redimens</HI> rescewing from daunger, or <HI>Redimiens,</HI> Dig|nifying or Crowning with Honour: the first, 1. Samuel <HI>13.</HI>41. shall <HI>Jonathan</HI> die, <HI>qui salutem tam magnam fecit,</HI> which hath giuen vs so great Deliuerance, that is, <HI>salus redimens,</HI> For the second, Psalme 21.5. His Glory is greate in <HI>tua salute,</HI> Why? <HI>Glory and Honour hast thou laide vppon him,</HI> There is <HI>Salus Redimiens,</HI> in
<PB REF="8">
both these, <HI>Dauid</HI> had his share from God more then any other. For the first, his <HI>Rescew</HI> from the Beares pawe, the Lions iawe, <HI>Saules</HI> iaue|line, <HI>Goliahs</HI> speare, <HI>Achitophels</HI> counsell, <HI>Do|egs</HI> slaunder, <HI>Schemi</HI> his reuiling, the mouth of the sword, the murren of his people, the mul|tiplicitie of his sinne, the rebellion of his sonne, (no meane nor ordinarie dangers) is an euident demonstration, and accordingly hee confessed it, when Psalme 54.7. hee sayeth, hee hath <HI>de|liuered</HI> mee from all my feare: For the second, his <HI>Honours</HI> were as many as his daungers, the fauour with his Prince, the loue of the people, the designed heritage of a Kingdome, the glo|rious wearing of a Crowne, the triumphant vi|ctories ouer his enemies, the secure establish|ing of his Kingdome in his sonne while he li|ued: these <HI>Salutes</HI> it pleased GOD to affoorde him, and with an othe to assure him; <HI>I will make him my first borne</HI> higher than <HI>the Kinges of the earth:</HI> himselfe putteth them both together, Psalme 10.1. verse <HI>4. Prayse the Lorde, O my soule, which saueth thy life from destruction,</HI> there is the first <HI>Salus,</HI> his acquitall from daunger: <HI>which crowneth thee with mercy and louing kindenesse</HI>; there is the second, his requitall with Honour. And so much for the pluralitie [<HI>Deliuerances,</HI>] the summe whereof, is that of our Prophet in Psalme 34, verse 19. <HI>Manie are the troubles of the
<PB REF="8">
righteous,</HI> but the <HI>Lord deliuereth them out of all,</HI> this is <HI>Plenitudo dextrae.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The second part.</HEAD>
<P>NOw we come to the <HI>Quality,</HI> that is, <HI>sa|lutare dextrae,</HI> For as GODS Deliueran|ces are many, so they bee <HI>Salutes,</HI> they haue health in them, they bee as <HI>Dauid</HI> sayeth, Psalme 21. Verse 3. <HI>Benedictiones dulcedinis</HI> sweete blessinges: <HI>Vsque in delicias amamur,</HI> sayeth <HI>Sene|ca:</HI> this is GODS <HI>Syntaxis,</HI> (as the vulgar Eng|lish reades, Psalme 28. verse 8. The wholesome <HI>Deliuerance</HI> of his annointed. It is not so with the sonnes of men, in whom there may be help&punc; <HI>sed non est salus in eis:</HI> Psalme 146.3. there is no <HI>health</HI> in their <HI>helpe: trust</HI> them not. <HI>Munera quae putas, insidiae sunt,</HI> their <HI>Deliuerances</HI> are not without some <HI>annoyance,</HI> Euen the verie <HI>Salue|re</HI> of the tongue, like the <HI>Saliva</HI> thereof, hath some venome in it, Psalme 28.<HI>3. They speake friendly to their neighboures, but imagine mischiefe in their heartes,</HI> But their reall <HI>Deliuerances,</HI> much more noxious: For as it is in the <HI>Apologue</HI> (to which the <HI>Poet</HI> alludeth) of the Combat betweene the <HI>Stagge</HI> and the <HI>Horse, viz.</HI>
<Q>That, the <HI>Horse</HI> beeing too weake for the <HI>Stagge,</HI>
<PB REF="9">
required the helpe of the man, which hee easily obtained; who getting vpon the <HI>Horse</HI> backe, driued the <HI>Stagge</HI> to flight, but after that, <HI>non equitem dorso, non fraenum depulit oze,</HI> he could neuer since quit his backe of the rider, nor his mouth from the bit:</Q>
so is it with the helps of worldly <HI>Potentates, beneficia viscata</HI>: as the birde hauing escaped the snare, percheth v|pon the tree for refuge, and there shee findes bird-lime to intangle her, from whence she can|not flie, but with losse of her feathers, if not of her members: so is it with the helps of <HI>States</HI> and <HI>Nations,</HI> aske their helpe in distresse they will graunt it; but withall, eyther they exact a tribute, which exhausteth the <HI>Treasury,</HI> or impose conditions, which infringe the <HI>Liberty,</HI> or re|quire a future aide, which weakeneth the <HI>Power,</HI> or betray vpon aduantage, which redoubles the <HI>Misery,</HI> or vpbraide the benefite, which exulce|rates the <HI>minde.</HI> This is <HI>Saluatio ab Optima|tibus,</HI> (as the <HI>Latines</HI> reade) <HI>Ieremy,</HI> 25.35. which as the Vsurers loane (to speake for the ca|pacity of the Citty) freeth a man from the prison for the time, but inuellops him in bondes more miserable, more durable than the prison. Here|in differing from God, for his blessing, sayeth <HI>Salomon,</HI> giueth <HI>riches,</HI> yea and <HI>Deliuerances; nec addit molestiam,</HI> and ioyneth no sorrowes with them. For if it bee <HI>salutare ex Sion,</HI> Ps. 53.6.
<PB REF="9">
<HI>Then shall</HI> Iacob <HI>reioyce, and</HI> Ifrael <HI>shall bee glad.</HI></P>
<P>And thus much for the word <HI>Salutes</HI>; the summe whereof is, Psalme 85.9. that if it be <HI>Sa|lutare Domini,</HI> there concurre with it, <HI>omnes salutes</HI> Glory, Mercy, Righteousnesse, Peace, as the Pro|phet there noteth. The conclusion that in psalme 3.8. <HI>Domini est salus,</HI> it is the Lord onely that giues true <HI>Deliuerance,</HI> and withall a blessing vpo~ his people. And this for the <HI>Pluralitie</HI> and <HI>Qua|litie</HI> of the <HI>Deliuerances.</HI></P>
<P>Now we come to the <HI>Quantitie,</HI> [<HI>Great</HI>] wherein wee will not goe further than this Psalme, nor there speake of his <HI>Salus coronans,</HI> eyther the <HI>Celsitude</HI> of his honour, verse 35. <HI>He hath set me vp on high places:</HI> nor of the <HI>Ampli+tude</HI> of his honour, verse 45. <HI>Thou hast made mee the head of the heathen, a people remote &amp; vnknowne</HI> nor of his <HI>Triumphs</HI> ouer his enemeies, verse 42. <HI>Driuing them, as the winde the dust before him trampling them as the clay in the streetes vnder him:</HI> (though this bee also the <HI>Salus coronans</HI> of our <HI>dread Soueraigne</HI> and <HI>glorious King</HI>) but onely shew the <HI>greatnesse</HI> of the <HI>dangers</HI> which <HI>Dauid</HI> escaped, as more sutable to this late <HI>horrible oc|current,</HI> both in respect of the <HI>dangers</HI> themselues as first, <HI>Dolores mortis,</HI> verse 4. the <HI>pangs of death</HI> which the imminent expectation put him vnto (for the expectation of death, is more bitter then
<PB REF="10" MS="y">
death it selfe. Secondly, <HI>Laquei mortis, funes infer|ni,</HI> verse 6. <HI>daungers</HI> in the <HI>darke, treasons</HI> in <HI>secret, treacheries</HI> of the <HI>Vault.</HI> Thirdly, <HI>aquae multae,</HI> one danger in the necke of another, verse 16. And also of the Authors, as verse 4. <HI>Torrentes ini|quitatis, streames</HI> of wickednesse, a concurrence of <HI>Conspirators.</HI> Secondly, (which is our late <HI>case</HI>) vers. 48. <HI>Vir iniuriarum,</HI> or <HI>rapinae,</HI> a cruell blood-thirstie wretch, like our <HI>Vault-enginer.</HI> All these of <HI>Dauids</HI> were great indeed, but compared to this of our <HI>gracious King:</HI> (the last, I trust, for a worse there cannot be) is but as a <HI>minium</HI> to a <HI>large,</HI> whether we consider therein, eyther the <HI>Plot it selfe,</HI> or the <HI>Con-comitance</HI> with it, or the <HI>Consequences</HI> of it.</P>

<P><PB REF="10" MS="y">Secondlie, <HI>Immane crueltie,</HI> in the multi|tude of the slaine, to make himselfe drunke with the blood of so many Worthies, and so innocent: (for by the reporte of militarie men) his prouision was so large, that if fire had beene giuen, (beside the place it selfe at the which hee aymed) the <HI>Hall of Iudgement,</HI> the <HI>Courtes of Re|cordes, the Collegiate Church, the Cittie of Westmin|ster,</HI> yea, <HI>White-Hall</HI> the Kinges house, had beene trushed and ouerthrowne, such heapes hee had layde in, of Billets, Fagots, huge stones, Iron-crowes, Pike-axes, great Hammer-heades, be|sides so many barrels of Gun-powder, fiue and thirtie in number small and great, as I am crede|bly informed.</P>
<P>Thirdly, his <HI>brutish immanity</HI>&punc; in the manner of the death, not <HI>man-like to kill,</HI> but <HI>beast-like</HI> to <HI>discerpe,</HI> and teare parcell meale, the bodies of such personages, <HI>Ferina rabies est,</HI> saith <HI>Seneca, di|laniare non occidere.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, his <HI>diuelish feritie</HI>; first, for the <HI>ma|terials of the death</HI> intended (<HI>Gun-powder</HI>) which they say none but the diuell, the King of the sul|phurious pit did inuent: secondly, for the <HI>fierie massacre</HI> it should haue made, not from heauen, as the fire that came downe from aboue vppon <HI>Iobs</HI> substance, Iob. 1.16. For which cause it is there called <HI>Ignis Dei,</HI> but vnder the earth, out of a Caue, as kindled and sent from the infernall
<PB REF="11" MS="y">
pit: The Apostle sayeth, <HI>That the member which sets on fire, Rotam generationis,</HI> Iames, 3.6. <HI>The whole course of generation</HI> (as this shoulde haue done) <HI>it selfe is set on fire by Hell.</HI></P>
<P>Fiftly, But this more then diuelish, for this <HI>Diuell of the Vault,</HI> contented not himselfe with the death of the bodie, but reached in his <HI>Pro|iect</HI> at the second death, of the soule; by ta|king away many, so suddenly in their <HI>sinnes vn|repented,</HI> with their mindes <HI>vn-prepared:</HI> I trust that this escape will make many to like the better of the prayer against suddaine death, for though I doubt not, but if it had beene effected, that this <HI>whirling blast</HI> woulde haue beene vnto our <HI>sacred King, (so Religious in his profession, so innocent from wrong, so cleare in his conscience)</HI> as the Whirle-wind and fiery cha|riot of <HI>Elias,</HI> to haue carried vppe his soule to heauen, and that God in his mercy, woulde haue made this <HI>Deluge of Bloode,</HI> as <HI>Baptismum sanguinis,</HI> a <HI>Baptisme of Martyrdome,</HI> to haue <HI>washt away our sinners</HI>; and as a <HI>Holocaust,</HI> an whole burnt sacrifice, to propitiate his wrath for our <HI>Transgressions,</HI> yet as much as in this <HI>Fury it lay,</HI> he wold haue sent vs all to hell.</P>
<P>Secondly, And still I say, a <HI>Rage</HI> more then <HI>diuelish:</HI> for the Diuell when hee is described to haue <GAP DESC="foreign">. Apoc. 12.12. to bee in his extreamest rage, yet then hee is saide, verse 4.
<PB REF="11" MS="y">
to haue drawne with his tayle, but the third part of the starres, and that from heauen to earth, but this Diuell, with his traine would at once haue pulled downe all the glorious <HI>Starres,</HI> both fix|ed, and erraticall (those that are fastened to the Court, and those which come and goe as they are called and dismissed) yea euen the Sunne &amp; the Moone themselues, not from heauen to earth, but to the bottomlesse pit, as much as in him lay.</P>
<P>Thirdly, and still I say, more then diuelish: For as the <HI>Fathers</HI> (alluding vnto that speech of the King of <HI>Sodome, Da mihi animas, caetera cape tibi</HI> Genes. 14.21.) doe well obserue, that the di|uell is contented with the soules of men, for if <HI>Iob</HI> would haue cursed God to his face, <HI>Iob.</HI> 1.11. he would not haue cared, though his substance and honour had beene encreased, and his life continued, but this Satanicall miscreant, must haue body and goods, and life, and soule, and all.</P>
<P>Lastly, marke in this Plot, a prodition with|out a match (and yet it shoulde haue beene ef|fected with a <HI>match</HI>) but I meane, a <HI>Treason</HI> without <HI>Paralell</HI>; a slaughter beyonde compari|son. For the <HI>Treason,</HI> the neerest that I find to it, is that in the Roman Historie of the school|maister among the <HI>Falerians,</HI> whose Citty <HI>Ca|millus</HI> besieged, who hauing the sonnes and
<PB REF="12" MS="y">
youth of all the Nobility, and the Chiefe of that Cittie in his tuition, drawing them into the fieldes a little without the Walles, vnder pretence for their recreation, betraide them all at once into the handes of <HI>Camillus:</HI> and yet herein there is a great <HI>disparison,</HI> for they were but children, but in this case olde and young, <HI>parents</HI> and <HI>progenie,</HI> all at once, should haue beene betrayed, they were aliue, and so might be eyther raunsomed or recouered, or if slaine yet they should haue seene their death: but here without ransom or recouery; or seeing who had hurt them (for so the letter boasts) a death sud|daine and invisible: there but the <HI>sprowtes</HI> of one Cities <HI>Nobilitie,</HI> a small <HI>territorie:</HI> heere the <HI>stem</HI> and <HI>seede Royall,</HI> with the <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Hope</HI> of this whole <HI>Ilands Gentry</HI> and <HI>Nobility.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>Slaughter</HI> none can I thinke of matchable therewith. <HI>Pharao</HI> slew the Males of <HI>Israel,</HI> but that was by <HI>Edict,</HI> and they were Children, and of his <HI>Vassalles. Herod massacred</HI> the infantes, but that was to secure him of his <HI>State,</HI> shaken (as he thought) by a prediction, <HI>Math.</HI> 2. <HI>Abi|melech</HI> and <HI>Athaliah,</HI> killed all the <HI>allies</HI> of the <HI>bloud,</HI> but their furie was stanched in the <HI>issue Royall.</HI> Of <HI>Achilles</HI> his furie, it is saide by the <HI>Poet,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, that he sent many worthy men to the <HI>graue</HI>: but that was in open warre, and in the compasse of many yeares.</P>
<P><PB REF="12" MS="y">And all these were <HI>Kinges</HI> and <HI>Tyrants,</HI> and so their mind the same with <HI>Polynices</HI> in the <HI>Tragae|dy, Imperia precio quonis constant ben&eacute;,</HI> that <HI>King|domes</HI> are to bee bought at any rate: but what shoulde moue this, <GAP DESC="foreign">, a <HI>vermine</HI> of the basest sorte, a very <HI>Tenebrio,</HI> the <HI>slaue of darkenesse,</HI> like a Mole vnder the grounde, to subuerte at one push as the <HI>Prophet</HI> speaketh, <HI>Esay. 9.14. heade</HI> &amp; <HI>tayle, braunch</HI> and <HI>roote,</HI> all in one day? <HI>Caligula,</HI> was but a shadow; for he wished that all the <HI>Cittizens of Rome,</HI> had but one <HI>necke,</HI> that at one blow hee might cut it off: but this <HI>Blood-sucker,</HI> not only wished it, but contriued it, prepared for it, and was ready to execute it. There was but one famous <HI>Nero,</HI> which for his <HI>Crueltie</HI> got the name of <HI>Nero</HI> fro~ all the rest, him hath he matched in <HI>Affection:</HI> for when one of <HI>Nero</HI> his <HI>dissolute</HI> company, had said <HI>Me mortuo,</HI> when I am deade, let heauen &amp; earth goe together&punc; Nay said <HI>Nero, Me viuo,</HI> while I am aliue.

<P>Now for the <HI>Con-comitance,</HI> what would haue come to passe, euen with that blow. The olde <HI>Greeke Prouerbe</HI> is, <GAP DESC="foreign">, that no great exploit can suddenly be effected, espe|cially, <HI>alteration of States,</HI> doe aske a long time &amp; must bee wrought by degrees: for <HI>omnis subita mutatio est periculosa,</HI> euen to the <HI>Conquerors</HI> them|selues, and therefore in their purpose to change a <HI>State,</HI> they will begin with one thing at once, as with <HI>weakening</HI> the <HI>force,</HI> or <HI>exhausting</HI> the <HI>wealth,</HI> or altering the <HI>Religion,</HI> or remouing their <HI>Gouernors,</HI> but in this designe, <HI>Vno flatu, vno ictu, vno nictu,</HI> with one blast at one blow, in one twinkling of an eye, should haue bin crushed to|gether, the <HI>Gouernement,</HI> the <HI>Councell,</HI> the <HI>wisedom,</HI> the <HI>Religion,</HI> the <HI>Learning,</HI> the <HI>strength,</HI> the <HI>Iustice</HI>&punc; of the whole land.

may he liue with vs, and raigne ouer vs, to the comfort of himselfe, to the ioy of his Realmes, to the confusion of his enemies, to the main|tenance of the Gospell, to the glory of the high|est.</P>
<P>And now (but that the time is so farre spent) I should come to the seconde parte, which is the <HI>Extensiue, vz.</HI> to whome God hath shewed these <HI>deliuerances,</HI> namely, [<HI>to his King and his annointed</HI>] wherein I might truely haue taken occasion, to haue shewed how these titles doe a|gree to our dread Soueraigne, both that hee is a King, and that he is <HI>Gods King,</HI> as hauing in him all the partes that may concur either in a king, or in a good King, to whom that title, first attribu|ted to <HI>Dauid,</HI> (which once before I named) the <HI>light of Israel,</HI> principally appertaineth, as one fro~ whose resplendent brightnesse, al the kingdomes of Christendome may receiue their light. Whe|ther wee looke vnto the <HI>light of nature</HI>; of preg|nant wit, of ready apprehension, of sound iudge+ment, of present dispatch, of impregnable me|mory.</P>
<P>Or the <HI>light of Art,</HI> being an vniuersall Schol|ler, acute in arguing, subtle in distinguishing, Lo|giclal in discussing, plentifull in inuenting&punc; pow|erfull in perswading, admirable in discoursing,</P>
<P>Or the <HI>light of grace,</HI> whether intellectuall, for speculatiue Theology, a perfect Textuar, a sound
<PB REF="18">
Expositor, a faithfull Christian, and a constant Professor, or affectuall, for Regeneration, an as|siduous prayer, a chast husband, of sweete carri|age, of humble deportment, of mortified lusts, of sanctified life.</P>
<P>Or the <HI>light of gouernment,</HI> an vpright ar|bitrator in cases of Iustice, a louing father to his subiects, a carefull guardian of his kingdomes, a wise manager of his State, an especial fauourer of this Citty, an absolute Monarch both for Regi|ment &amp; iudgment: And yet <HI>these lights thus glori|ouslie shining in this golden candlesticke,</HI> this <HI>No|cturnus Ambulo,</HI> this <HI>diurnus Nebulo,</HI> this nightes gadder, this daies Pioner, would haue at once blowne out.</P>
<P>So would I also haue handled this worde <HI>An|nointed,</HI> which makes a King a <HI>sacred</HI> person and therein I purposed, to haue shewed vnto you, that this practise of murthering princes, is made an <HI>Axiom</HI> of <HI>Theologie</HI> among the <HI>Romanists:</HI> who so reads <HI>Parsons, Dolman, Allen</HI> and <HI>Parsons</HI> their cases of conscience, <HI>Stapleton</HI> his <HI>quod libeticall</HI> O|ration at <HI>Doway, Rossaeus, Reynoldes, Gyfford,</HI> or the bitter expostulation of <HI>Ludouicus</HI> of <HI>Orleance,</HI> in the case of the <HI>Guyses</HI> faction against <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Nauar,</HI> now King of <HI>France</HI>; and lastly, the positi|ons of the Iesuites of <HI>Salamanca,</HI> shall finde it a conclusion of positiue Diuinitie: Whereof, were there no other, this worde <HI>Annointeed,</HI> is
<PB REF="19">
an vnanswerable confutation. <HI>Touch not mine an|nointed,</HI> saith the Prophet, Psal. 105.15. For this <HI>Dauid</HI> took as an inuiolable restraint, both when <HI>Saule</HI> was giuen into his handes, <HI>How should I lay handes vpon the Lords annointed,</HI> 1. <HI>Sam.</HI> 24. and as a sufficient reason to execute <HI>Saules murtherer</HI> at least the <HI>messenger</HI> of his death, 2. Sam. 1. <HI>Howe durst thou touch the Lords annointed? Honorauit vi|uum, Vindicauit mortuum,</HI> saith Saint <HI>Augustin,</HI> on|ly for this reason, because he was <HI>annointed:</HI> and yet, those which make <HI>Religion</HI> the <HI>stawking-horse</HI> for <HI>Treasons,</HI> pretend the <HI>Catholike Cause,</HI> (as these <HI>Conspirators</HI> now did) to murther the lords <HI>Annointed.</HI> Against whome, I would (if the time had serued) in this case haue beene more bitter, but that I remember there are some amongst vs, who challenge vnto themselues the <HI>quintessence</HI> of <HI>Annointing</HI> as He, Esay 65. <HI>Come not neere mee for I am Holier then thou,</HI> yet come very neare to the same dangerous position: not to speake of <HI>Knox</HI> and <HI>Buchanan,</HI> the two fiery spirites of that <HI>Church and Nation</HI> where they liued, what means that speech of some of our owne Countrie, ex|tant in <HI>Print,</HI> in the late <HI>Queenes</HI> time of blessed memory? <HI>that if their reformation shoulde not bee yeelded vnto there woulde bee shortly a bloody day in England</HI> But the time being so farre gone, I wil cut off that whole part (being forced thereunto. In the meane time I shall desire you to ioyn with
<PB REF="19">
me in hearty prayer vnto Almighty God for the continuance of our good King, our State, and our Religion amongst vs, giuing him thankes for his wonderfull mercie, in preseruing vs from this terrible blow (as they called it) from this de|sperate, dreadfull and damnable attempt, say|ing,
<Q><L>O Eternal God and our most mighty Protector, &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>As it followeth in that prayer, beginning with those wordes, prin|ted in the book of Thanksgiuing for this discouery and deliue|ry: But made by the Preacher.</P>
<P><HI>And let all true Subiects say Amen.</HI></P>
