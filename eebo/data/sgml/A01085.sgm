<P><HI>_PEACE,</HI> take it
with all faults,
is better then
Warre: and
the ende of a iust warre,
is but <HI>Studium Pacis,</HI> the
intention of a right peace.
The Subiect then is be|yond
exception, to all that
loue Peace. But commonly
they, with whom it med|dles,
<PB REF="3">
refuse to meddle with
it. Let such take the course
of their vnhappy precipice
into euerlasting vnquiet|nesse,
who wilfully reiect
the cure of their affected
maladie: denying their
consciences a trouble that
may saue them, for feare
of loosing a trouble that
<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter">h please them. As if a
man were lesse then mad,
that will leap into the fire,
o auoid the smoke. There
is <HI>Pax fundamenti,</HI> the
peace of Doctrine: and
<HI>Pax Ordinis,</HI> the peace of
Discipline. The Heretike
would pull downe the first
Pillar, the Schismaticke
<PB REF="3">
the other: The former
would break our peace with
Christ; the latter with our
selues &amp; the Church: both
these are almost desperate.
But there is a third, <HI>Pax
Politica,</HI> a ciuill Peace:
and the common distur|bers
of this are such con|tentious
spirits; that either
vnprouoked, out of mis|chieuous
intention: or be|ing
prouoked, out of mali|cious
reuenge; set all in
vprore, make a mutiny
in manners, an ataxie in
the course of life. To cure
this <HI>Babel,</HI> if at least shee
will bee cured, is the scope
of this Tractate. Peace
<PB REF="4">
was Christs blessed Lega|cie
to his Church; and we
are the Ministers whom
he hath chosen to see it pay|ed.
Executours are often
sued for the bequests giuen
by dead Testators: Loe
here a Legacie without su|ing
from a liuing Father.
Embrace it, and bee regu|lated
by it: so shall your
hearts finde present com|fort,

It is delectable to

a smiling looke, which
neuer frowned with the
lest scowle of anger:
snowy armes, soft as
Downe, and whiter then
the Swannes feathers;
alwaies open to pious
embracements. Her mil|ken
hand carries an O|liue
branch, the Sym|bole
and Embleme of
quietnesse. She hath the

face of a glorious An|gell,
alwaies looking to|wards
righteousnesse, as
the two Cherubins loo|ked
one vpon the other,
and both vnto the Mer|cy-Seate.
Her Court is
the inuincible Fort of
integrity; so guarded by
the diuiue prouidence;
that Drummes, Trum|pets,
and thundring Ca|nons,
those lowd Instru|ments
of war, (I meane
Blasphemy, Contenti|on,
Violence) may af|front
her, but neuer af|fright

like the Garment of

Christ; if a faithfull
soule can come to touch
it, to kisse it; all her vex|ations
are fled, her con|science

shee is alwayes compo|sing
salues for all the
wounds of a broken
heart, Sedition and tu+mult

Shee sits in a Throne of

<HI>Peace.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The requi|sitenesse &amp; revvard of Peace.</NOTE> In these
continuall Dogge-daies
of ours, wherein loue
waxeth cold, and strife
hote, wee had need set
our Instruments to the
tune of Peace. This
was the blessed legacie
which Christ bequea|thed
to his Church: the
Apostle from his Ma|ster
sent it as a token to
the <HI>Corinthians:</HI> and I
from the Apostle com|mend
it as a Iewell to
all Christians;<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Cor. 13. 11</NOTE> <HI>Liue in
<PB N="7" REF="7">
Peace, and the God of Loue
and Peace shall bee with
you.</HI> Which conclusion
of the Epistle containes
the blessing of the Apostle':
a Valediction, and
a Benediction. They are
in part Hortatory, in
part Consolatory: the
vertue to which he per|swades
them, and the re|ward
which hee promi|seth
them. There is a
sweet symphony, and
respondent proposition
betweene the Counsell
and the Comfort; the
Actiue Peace, and the
Factiue Peace: for see|king
peace on Earth, we
<PB N="8" REF="8">
shall find peace in Hea|uen:
for keeping the
peace of God, wee shall
bee kept by the God of
peace. The one is the
regular Compasse of
our life on Earth, the o|ther
is the glorious
Crowne of our life in
Heauen.</P>
<P>That wee may not
cherish too weake an o|pinion
of this duty, wee
must know, that this A|postolicall
counsel is an
Euangelicall law;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The forme of a right Lavv.</NOTE> and
binds vs all to the peace.
<HI>Liue in Peace:</HI> there are
in it all the concurring
qualities, that define a
<PB N="9" REF="8">
good law; as <HI>Lycurgus</HI>
taught: <HI>Generalitas, Bo|nitas,
Possibilitas.</HI> It must
be Generall, Good, Pos|sible.</P>
<P>Generall, so that all
be tied to the obedience
of it. Else it were like <HI>A|nacharsis</HI>
law, a cobweb
to catch flies: or those
tyranous ce~sures, which
are made to vex Doues,
while they are indul|gent
to Buzzards.</P>
<P>It must be Good, for
none are bound to the
obedience of vniust
things. If it haue an in|different
extent to good
or bad, there is easily
<PB N="10" REF="9">
found some colour of
euasion.</P>
<P>It must bee Possible;
for if things be imposed
<HI>vltra posse,</HI> and so men
be made lyable to the
mulct, when they are
not culpable of the
guilt; they may obiect
that <HI>Naturae dictamen.
Nemo tenetur ad impossi|bile:</HI>
none are to be ty|ed
to the obedience of
impossible things. Such
are Tyrants Lawes; not
<HI>vincula, sed retia:</HI> not
limits to confine, but
netts to ensnare: not
Pales, but Toiles.</P>
<P>But the Law of <HI>Peace</HI> is
<PB N="11" REF="9">
General,<NOTE PLACE="marg">the equity of Peace</NOTE> none can plead
immunitie. Good, none
taxe it of iniquitie. Pos|sible,
none can say, it is
beyond their abilitie.
But it may be obiected.
If you require it Gene|rall,
it is not Possible:
for wee cannot haue
peace with all men. If it
were Possible, yet is it
not lawfull and good;
for wee may not haue
peace with all men. To
direct vs in this, the A|postle
inserts two cau|tions.
<HI>If it be possible,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ro. 12. 18 <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>and</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE> <HI>as

&amp;c.</HI> Forbeare not only
to sit in the <HI>Chaire</HI> of

which is <HI>Sinne entring:</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="10">
teaching vs to shunne
the very acquaintance

<P>But wicked men can|not
be auoided;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The termes of Peace distingui+shed.</NOTE> and so
long as wee are in this
world, wee must con
uerse with men of the
world. To answer this,
we must distinguish be|tweene
offenders, and
offences: we may haue
no peace with the one,
true peace with the o|ther.
There are two
names,<NOTE PLACE="marg">August.</NOTE> <HI>Homo &amp; Pecca|tor:</HI>
a Man, and a Sin|ner.
<HI>Quod Peccator est,
corripe: quod Homo, mi|serere.</HI>
As he is a Sinner,
<PB N="14" REF="11">
reforme him: as he is a
man, the Image of God,
pitie him. Doth thy
Brother sinne of igno|rance?
<HI>Dilige errantem,
interfice errorem:</HI> kill the
error, preserue thy bro|ther.
Doth hee offend
of frailty? Bee at peace
<HI>(cum hominibus, non cum|moribus)</HI>
with the man,
not with the manners.
Trespasseth hee of ma|lice?
Hate (<HI>vitium,</HI> not
<HI>virum</HI>) the disease, not
the patient. Howsoeuer
these infirmities are in|euitable,
still wee may
haue Peace, <HI>Cum malis,
licet non in malis:</HI> with
<PB N="15" REF="11">
euill men, though not
in euill matters.</P>
<P>Indeede let him that
hath anthority, correct
malicious offences: for
that is not like a rauisher
to abuse, but like a Cha~|pion
to vindicate the ho|nour
of peace. Yet still
<HI>Cum corrigat malitiam,
diligat personam;</HI> let him
correct the transgressi+on,
loue the person.</P>
<P>But how shall we an|swere
that of the Psal|mist?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 59. 5.</NOTE>
<HI>Be not mercifull to
them that sinne of mali|tious
wickednesse.</HI> This
was not <HI>Precantis votum,
sed Prophetantis vaticini|um:</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="12">
not the request of
a Petitioner, but the pre|diction
of a Prophecier.
Hee did not wish it
should be so, but saw it
would be so.</P>
<P>But if all this be true,
wee may then admit
peace with <HI>Rome?</HI> Wee
doe accept a Ciuill, not
a Religious peace. In a
treatise of pacification,
both parties must yeeld
somwhat: but nothing is
to be yeelded that may
preiudice the Truth. In
a Musicall Instrument
the strings that bee out
of tune, are set vp, or set
downe to the rest: the
<PB N="17" REF="12">
strings that be in tune,
are not stirred. Our Do|ctrine
and Profession are
tuned to the blessed Go|spell,
that infallible Ca|non
of Truth, and there|fore
must not bee chan|ged.
Their Faith and
Religion iarreth and er|reth
from that; therefore
must bee proportioned
to ours, if they will en|denour
a perfect Har|mony.</P>
<P>Thus far,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The life of Peace.</NOTE> &amp; vpon these
tearmes wee may haue
peace, if we seeke it: we
may liue in peace, and
peace may liue in vs, if
we desire it. Therefore
<PB N="18" REF="13">
still <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Liue in
peace. Caluin</HI> renders it,
<HI>Pacem agite, Doe peace.</HI>
Or, as if God should say
to men, whom he found
quarrelling, or too
lowd; <HI>Peace.</HI> The word
is emphaticall, and imi|tates
a continual habite:
wee may call it, The
Exercise of peace, or
the Practice of peace.</P>
<P>Some haue a good
mind to peace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The neglect.</NOTE> but they
will bee at no labour a|bout
it: many are con|tent
to embrace it, but
they are ashamed to seek
it: most men loue it, few
practise it. The vse com|mends
<PB N="19" REF="13">
the vertue: the
beautie and praise of
peace consists not in
motion, but in action:
nor is the benefit of it in
a knowing discourse, but
in a feeling sense. A Spe|culatiue
peace, is like an
Historicall knowledge:
such as he that hath bin
alwayes confined to his
study, may haue of for|raine
countries: so wee
make a conquest of
peace, as the by|word
sayes, our Fathers
wonne <HI>Boloigne;</HI> who
neuer came within the
report of the Canon.
Or if the <HI>Grecians</HI> kept
<PB N="20" REF="14">
Philosophy in their
leaues, but kept it not in
their liues. A ieiune and
emptie speculation, like
some subtill ayre in the
head, onely breakes out
into crochets: it is ex|perience
that brings the
sweetnesse of peace
home to the heart. Vse
breeds perfectnesse, and
disuse looseth the most
seruiceable things. Gold
looseth more of the
waight by rusting in
corners, then by conti|nuall
running in com|merces,
the proper end
it was coyned for. The
best land will yeeld smal
<PB N="21" REF="14">
encrease, if it be not til|led:
though some haue
the most profitable
trades, the want of in+dustry
hath made them
the poorest men. The
throne of peace is in the
heart, not in the head.</P>
<P>To recouer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Me|thod.</NOTE> therefore
the swouning life of this
vertue, I will compare
<HI>Peace</HI> to a <HI>Citie:</HI> if you
will, to this City: which
should be like <HI>Ierusalem,</HI>
A <HI>Citie of Peace.</HI> And so
much we will pray for
it; that it may preserue
peace, and peace may
preserue it, to the

<P>How easily doth this

Body &amp; Bloud of Christ
no more worth, but that
for loue of a peeuish hu|mour

What is then to be done

for the Israelite to ab|sent

<P>In a word, let vs turne

<P>Of all Nations we are

There are three wayes

<HI>Dignissimus Regno, si non

fight with a god at his

the Lord giues most ho|nour,
he giues most assi|stance.
<HI>The heart of the
King is in his hand, as ri|uers

is more need of his om|nipotence.
Howsoeuer,

<P>Anarchie is the mo|ther

the State of Italy wants
a King, all runnes into
ciuill broiles. It is the
happinesse of this Citie,
that there is no distra|ction.
Not a King at
<HI>Iudah,</HI> and another at

but <HI>Henricus
Rosas, Regna Iacobus:</HI> in

is not a Peace-maker;
ours, like a second <HI>Au|gustus,</HI>
hath shut the ru|stie

complaines the want of

perfourmed to euery

<HEAD>The Riuer that serues
this Citie of Peace</HEAD>
<P>Is <HI>Prosperitie.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Riuer of this Citie.</NOTE> It is one
<PB N="152" REF="80">
principall happinesse of
a Citie, to bee scituated
by a Riuers side: that as
it hath fortified it selfe
by land, so it may haue
commaund of the Sea.
Prosperitie is the Riuer
to this Citie, that like a
louing Meander, winds
it selfe about, throwing
his siluer Armes vpon
her sides; ebbing slowly,
but flowing merrily, as
if he longed to embrace
his loue. Peace is the
mother of Prosperitie,
but Prosperitie is too
often the murtherer of
Peace. For peace breeds
wealth, wealth breedes
<PB N="153" REF="80">
pride, pride breeds con|tention,
and contention
kils peace. Thus shee is
often destroyed by her
owne issue, as <HI>Senache|rib</HI>
was by his owne bo|wels.</P>
<P>Take this Citie wee
liue in for an Instance.
Peace hath brought
Gods plentie: the Inha|bitants
neither plowe,
nor sowe, nor reape; yet
are fed like the fowles
of heauen. They fare
well with lesse trouble,
then if come grewe at
their doores, and cattell
grased in their streets.
But as <HI>Nylus</HI> may rise
<PB N="154" REF="81">
too high, and water E|gypt
too much; so the
inundation of opulency
may doe the~ hurt. Thus
may the influence of
heauen, and the plentie
of earth, be a <HI>Snare</HI> vnto
vs; and our abundance,
an occasion of our <HI>fal|ling.</HI>
Prosperitie is hear|tie
meat, but not digesti|ble
by a weake stomack,
strong wine, but naught
for a weake braine. <HI>The
prosperitie of fooles de|stroyeth
them.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pro. 1, 32</NOTE> It is not
simply prosperitie, but
the prosperitie of fooles
that destroyeth them.
The swelling Riuer by
<PB N="155" REF="81">
the surfet of a Tyde,
doth not sooner bring
in our encrease; but our
encrease doth breed in
our minds another swel|ling,
in our bodies ano|ther
surfeting: we swell
in pride, and surfet in
wantonnesse. The Is|raelites
neuer fared so
well, as when they liued
at Gods immediate fin|ding;
and at night ex|pected
their morrowes
breakfast fro~ the clouds.
When they did daily
aske, and daily receiue
their daily bread.</P>
<P>There be (as I heard
a worthy Diuine ob|serue)
<PB N="156" REF="82">
three maine Ri|uers
in the land, where|of
this is held the best:
and this Citie is placed
in the best Seate of the
Riuer, vpon the gentle
rising of a hill, in the
best ayre, and richest
soyle. When a Cour|tier
gaue it out, That
Queene <HI>Mary</HI> being dis|pleased
with the Citie,
threatned to diuert both
Tearme and Parliament
to Oxford: an Alder|man
asked whether shee
meant to turne the cha|nell
of the <HI>Thames</HI> thi|ther,

hee, by Gods grace we

<HI>The lines are fallen to vs

Both the Elements are
our friends; the Earth
sends vs in her fruites,
the Sea her merchan|dise.
Wee are neere e|nough
the benefits, and
farre enough from the
dangers of the Ocean.
Nothing is wanting to
the consummation of
our happinesse: to keepe
vs in our owne Coun|trey,
in our owne Citie,
in our owne Houses,
but that which keepes
men in their wits, Tem|perance,
<PB N="158" REF="83">

<P>But doe wee not re|quite
this Riuer of Pro|speritie,
with vngrateful
impietie? and vse the
Ocean of Gods boun|tie,
as wee doe the
Thames? It brings vs
in all manner of proui|sion;
Clothes to couer
vs, Fuell to warme vs,
Food to nourish vs,
Wine to cheare vs,
Gold to enrich vs: and
we in recompense, foile
it with our rubbish, filth,
common sewers, &amp; such
excretions. It yeeldes
vs all manner of good

things, and we requite
it with all plentie of bad
things. It comes flowing
in with our commodi|ties,
&amp; we send it loaden
backe with our iniuries.</P>
<P>Such toward God is
the impious ingratitude
of this famous Citie,
which else had no Para|lell

Shee may not vnfitly

<HEAD>The Life of the

the loue of men there
can be no peace of God,

He that loues not the

friend to the <HI>Head.</HI> To
say we loue Christ, and
hate a Christian; is as
if a man, while hee was
saluting or protesting
loue to his freind, should
tread on his toes. I
know indeed, that euery
creature is to bee loued,
but <HI>in ordine ad Deum:</HI>
<PB N="164" REF="86">
Religion doth not for|bid,
but rectifie our af|fections.
Our Parents,
spouses, children, allies,
countrymen, neighbors,
friends; haue all their
due places in our loue:
and it were a brutifh do|ctrine
to dispossesse vs
of these humane rela|tions.
Onely they must
know their orders and
stations, and by no
meanes vsurpe vpon
God: they must not be
mistresses, but hand|maides
to the loue of
Christ.</P>
<P>But let vs loue them,
because they loue God:
<PB N="165" REF="86">
as reflections of our
sight, which glaunce
from the Lord vpon his
Image: if God haue
their hearts, let them
haue our hearts. It is
poore to loue a man for
that is about him: hee
must bee loued for that
is within him. If wee
should account of men
as we doe of bagges;
prize them best that
weigh heauiest, and
measure out our loue by
the Subsidie-booke; ho|nouring
a man because
he is well cloathed: I
see then no reason, but
wee should doe greater
<PB N="166" REF="87">
reuerence to the Bason

humbly salute Sattin &amp;
Veluet in whole pieces,

<P>No, but especially let
vs loue others, because
they feare God, and
serue Iesus Christ. For
as the braine is to the
sinewes, the liuer to the
veines, and the heart to
the arteries; so is Gods
loue to humane socie|ties:
as the very soule
<PB N="167" REF="87">
by which they liue, and
the forme that giues
them being. Otherwise
our companies are con|spiracies;
when we fall

vs beginne our loues a|boue,
deriuing this holy
fire from the Altar of
Heauen; let our faith
inkindle it at the heart

and wee need not tra|uell
farre to seeke out
such an image or resem|blance.</P>
<P>Looke wee vpon our
owne Nation, the hap|py
Module of this Citie
of peace. It was sayd,
that in Rome a man
might see all Countries:
<PB N="169" REF="88">
and the Romans vsed
to solace themselues; <HI>It
is good looking on a Map
of the World, vbi nihil
in orbe videmus alienum,</HI>
when wee find nothing
in the world which is
not our owne. What
doth the whole earth
produce, which is not
yeelded to our enioy|ing?
What was once
sayd of <HI>Ormus,</HI> is true
of this Citie, Turne the
world into a Ring, and
this is the Diamond
of it. Like to <HI>Gideons
Fleece,</HI> it hath been wet

when drought was
<PB N="170" REF="89">
on the whole earth be|sides:
Or like <HI>Nylus,</HI>
which keeps within the
Bankes, when other Ri|uers
ouerflow their con|tinents.
Some Nations
haue peace, but with|out
the Truth: other
haue the Trueth, but
without Peace: wee
haue both Truth and
Peace. Our neighbours
haue beene exercised
with troubles, whirled
about with hostile tu|mults;
their eares af|frighted
with the thun|der
of those murdering
pieces: their eyes aga|shed
with their Temples
<PB N="171" REF="89">
and Tabernacles fla|ming
about their heads:
Infants bleeding vpon
the stones, and their a|mazed
mothers raui|shed
ere they can bee
permitted to die. The
shrikes of the dying, and
slauery of the liuing, vn|der
the mercilesse hands
of a killing or insulting
aduersary; these haue
beene their distracting
obiects: none of them
come neere vs. There
is no rifling of houses,
no flying to refuges, no
rotting in Dungeons,
no ruinating of Monu|ments,
no swelling the
<PB N="172" REF="90">
chanels with blood, no
fiering of Cities, no
Rapes of Virgines, no
dashing of Babes against
the stones, nor casting
them, as they droppe
from their mothers
wombes, into their mo|thers
flames. But in
stead of these, the truth
of the Gospell is prea|ched,
pietie professed,
the practise of it encou|raged;
Grace promising,
and Peace performing,
blessed rewards.</P>
<P>That is verified in vs,
which is recorded of
the dayes of <HI>Solomon;
That hee had peace on all
<PB N="173" REF="90">
sides round about him:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Kings 4. 25.</NOTE>
<HI>and Iudah &amp; Israel dwelt

sayd of <HI>Rhodes; Semper

of mercy embra|ceth
vs, and hath made
vs a day of peace, not
shorter then sixty yeres:
the fauours of God o|uer
shadowing vs, as the
Cherubins did the Mer|cie-Seat.
I know that
Rome frets at this, and
let the Harlot rage her
heart out: shee thun|ders
out Curses, but
<PB N="174" REF="91">
(praised bee God) wee
neuer more prospered,

peace with our selues: a
