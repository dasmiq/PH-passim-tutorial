<P>_MAny good Captains (Right Reverende and my very good Lord) thinke it, not their duety, to fight the~selues, but only to giue co~mand to others: and Physici|ans without blame prescribe to others that which they apply not to themselues: but of the preacher of the worde of God it is justly required, no lesse in life &amp; practise, the~ in speech or wri|ting, to expresse the soundnes of doctrine, or, to speake it in <HI>Homers</HI> words,
<Q><GAP DESC="foreign">.</Q>
as by his doctrine hee must preach to our cares, so by his example hee must preach to our eies: that so by both he might lay hole of our hartes, as by the light of the one hee must direct vs that we stray not, so by the footsteps of the other he must lead vs that
<PB REF="3">
we stumble not, &amp; by the harmony of both affect vs that we slacke not. Thus if he doe, not only teaching, <HI>as Christ taught,</HI> but also<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign"> Mat. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">. 19.</NOTE> living as he teacheth others to liue, <HI>hee shall be called great in the kingdome of heave~:</HI> he shal be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">eckoned amo~g the <HI>her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s</HI> of the Christ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">a~ common wealth. By hid doctrine hee shall win assent and obedience: by his example, imitation and loue: and by both admirati|on and reverence. That the author of this learned and godly sermon is one of these, there is no need to prooue: nor how his life and practise, as if it had beene the other twin of the same mother, or the other hand of the same body, hath alway been answe|rable to the doctrine of humility, which in this sermon is handled at large, although I envy not that there are very many argu|ments to make this point plaine: yet I could wish there were not so many by one: and that, seeing his humble and modest minde may &amp; doth otherwise so easily appear, he would spare to shew it, by his vnwillingnes to publish his learned labours: by which at this time others are forced to publish some parte of them for him without making him acquainted therwith. As for the rest seeing it must be so, we are content <GAP DESC="foreign">&punc; even vntill God shall put it into
<PB REF="3">
his minde, to stay for that for which hee is in debt to vs (<GAP DESC="foreign">,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 1. 14.</NOTE> every man that hath received of God is a debter to Christ in GOD and to the<NOTE PLACE="marg">1, Cor. 3. 22. 23.</NOTE> church in Christ) but for this little streame of the great river of his godly learning we hope at length wee shall not only obtaine pardon, for publishing it vvithout giving him notice (for so heretofore it hath hap|pened to many learned men, and as <HI>Possi|d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s</HI> reporteth, even to <HI>Augustine</HI> in manie of his workes) but also deserue thankes of the whole Church of God, whe~ the auctor by this experience in the lesser, gessing howe his greater paines will bee accepted, shall beginne to dare to bring foorth the ampler &amp; more laborious fruits of his lear|ned and religious study.</P>
<P>As surely meete it is that he which is so well armed and provided should not feare to venter: and that the lesse the certainety and the shorter the continuance of the life of man is, the sooner the common wealth &amp; Church should enioy the life &amp; vertue of him that is excellent. <HI>If vvee will vse none but Pompey</HI> (saith Catulus in a deliberation of heaping imployments vpon none but Pompey) <HI>what if wee loose Pompey, whom the~ shall we vse? it is not good</HI> (saide the Lacede|monian

<P>He must be greater then any <HI>Achilles</HI> (for it is proper to God alone) which would be a|ble to bee alone. Even Adam in Paradise had neede, and everie creature hath neede of a helper. I confesse (the thankes be vnto God) there are many helpers in our church, ioyning hand with him vpon who~ out eies are chiefely fixte: even more then those 9. Peers, of whom, when <HI>Achilles</HI> ceased from warre in his disconte, <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ax</HI> makes boast to <HI>Hector:</HI> that without the hardy <HI>Achilles</HI> there was choise enough of one to encounter him <GAP DESC="foreign">.</P>

<P>But if the best among vs continue thus dif|fident of their owne ability (how confide~t of the cause so&euml;ver they be) it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> to bee fea|red, least hee which as yet hath, or may haue many helpers, bee at length either left alone, or without a fitte helper. Such a one as this autor (to speake without the dis|pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ise of any) sure would be. As he that is not partiall even in this his godly Sermon may discerne him: as he can know a I yon by his claw, and <HI>Hercules</HI> by his singer.

</LG>
<P>I speake even of the <GAP DESC="foreign"> which in this ser|mon appeareth: whether we co~sider the di|rectnes of his method, &amp; distinct ordering and handling of so many chiefe pointes of di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ine meditation and singular vse, or his zeale in affection, or his discreet moderati|on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">n applying, or delightfull copiousnes in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">. I speake the more sparingly of
<PB REF="5">
him because I speak as it were to his face: &amp; because I speake to you (Right Reverend) which haue knowne him so long&punc; and ever since you knewe him, haue loved him so deatly. But I would his modesty woulde not forget her selfe in one thing, nor make him in iudging of himselfe to attribute (al|most against modesty) more to his owne iudgment, in which he is too severe to him|selfe, then to your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ps. farre more indiffe|rent estimation. whose intirenes of affectio~ towards him, seeing it first arose fro~ iudge|ment, cannot bee any better argument a|gainst the soundnesse of the iudgemente, then the sweetenesse of the fruite is against the soundnesse of the roote. For why shoulde hee suffer his learned papyrs to bee like the hidden riches of a covetous man, good for none vntill the ovvners death? as if it vvere not with the workes of learned men, that are published after the auctors death, as with children which are borne after their fathers death (<GAP DESC="foreign">) or as if since falshood now hath gotten so strong a heade, the shamefast modesty of the learned vvere not to bee contente to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">cken her bridle, and to suffer zeale to vse the spurre. It is not shamefastnesse
<PB REF="6">
nor her daughter silence, of which they nowe have neede. Both of which, as they are excuses for me diocrity, so they are pre|iudices against excellency: as they are al|way the wisedome of fools, so in such times as these are, they are the folly of the wise. Neither is it much more excusable, in such times of ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">de, for the learned to hide themselues with Achilles, then for the vn|learned to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">st themselues forward with Thersites. As much as the one kinde over|shoo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">es by boldnes, so much the other fals short by fearfulnes, both of them are much amisse. And therfore Xenopho~ in his third booke of Memorables, makes Socrater to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ke no lesse care to disswade Charmides, the vncle of Plato the Philosopher, from refraining himselfe, then to disswade Glau|co, the brother to the same Plato, fro~ thru|sting himselfe forwardes, to medle in the buisines of the publike state. The former of these was a man of very much worth, but of too little boldnes: the later was a man of very much boldnes, but of too little wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">h. The fault of the later was more odious but the fault of the former was more hurtfull, more reason to blame the later: but more neede to blame the former. The later by too much contemning others, and magni|fying
<PB REF="6">
himselfe, made himselfe co~temtible: but the former by too much regarding o|thers and contemning himselfe made him|selfe vnprofitable. The later by his boldnes gained the dispraise which he might haue avoided&punc; but the former by his shamefast|nes avoided the commendation which he might haue ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ed&punc; asmuch as the one nee ded the bridle, so much the other needed the spurre: the one for his owne sake, that he might leaue drawing on harme vppon himselfe: the other for the co~mon wealths sake: that he might leaue of with holding the publique good. For so is every vertue and especially the godly learning of the chieffest among vs: the <HI>honestum</HI> is proper, but the profit is co~mo~: it is <GAP DESC="foreign"> it is <HI>Thesaur&abus; ecclesiae:</HI> I meane not for any <HI>In dulgences</HI> after they are dead, but for prese~t vse while they live. By how much the ra|ther I hope, that every one which loues the truth (seeing himselfe also hath a part in e|very common good) wil both by his grate|full acceptance encorage, and by his praier to God aide &amp; further the reverend auctor of this godly sermon: that neither sickenes, nor any other barre may hinder him from performing, for the advancing of the truth, farre greater thinges, then as yet appeare&punc;
<PB REF="7">
for my selfe, as I could willingly, thinke of my self that I am <GAP DESC="foreign">: So I will alway pay him, &amp; alway owe him al the duties of loue&punc; for which vnto him ever since my child|hood: and to you (right reverend) for these many yeares, I am very deeply engaged. Of your Lp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">. hee could say, in his preface to a<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">n Gene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"></NOTE> most profitable work of yours&punc; that he wold be your reme~bra~cer <GAP DESC="foreign">. The argumentes which there hee vses, with the whole co~pariso~, in which he prefers writing before publik preachig by word of mouth may be returned vpon himselfe: with that which Pomponius in Plutarch, dehorting his sonne Numa from private obscurity, tells him&punc; that it is God which calles him, &amp; suf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">rs not his giftes to sleepe in him: that the meanager of publique buisines is as it were the hande of God: that hee must not <GAP DESC="foreign">, play the fugitiue, or deny God such service as in off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ng occasions and g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">uing abilities he requires: nor aban|don the <GAP DESC="foreign">, the fielde &amp; matter of good actions&punc; But my purpose is not to tell him what he should do, as indeede it beseemes me not, but onely to signifie our desire co~|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">ing w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">th your Lps. of whose desire, &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> desire I am not altogeather ig|norant:

<P>Of wisedome first this I haue to say: that of al the gifts, wherewith the Lord doth beautifie the soule of man, none seemeth to be co~parable to it: sure I am none ought to bee preferred before it. For it is the very sterne of our vessel, the very sunne of our firmament, the verie

eie of our head, the very hart of our bo dy. Where wisedome sittteth at the sterne there matters are ordered in a probable course to a laudable end.

<P>And why? First because it is not our owne, or of our selues: as <HI>Cyprian</HI> saith:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cypriam.</NOTE> <HI>De nullo gloriandum, quia nostrum nihil</HI>

For if it were lawful to boast of that, which is not our owne, then the crowe might haue beene iustified for brauing it with her borowed or stollen feathers (<HI>furti|vis coloribus</HI>) &amp; the asse for ietting with the Lions skinne about him, &amp; the ape for skipping vp &amp; downe in his masters iacket.

<P>The second this: Our wisedome is many waies vnperfect, therfore, if wee be wise, we will not bragge of it. For wil any bragge of his lame legge, or his one cie? Indeede now I remember <HI>Agesilaus</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plutarch. in Ages. et Sert.</NOTE> bragged of his club-foote, &amp; had never

<P>As I gaue this for one reason, whie strength shoulde not be gloried in, be|cause it is not to be compared to wise|do~e, which I had proved before might not bee allowed to boaste: so I may assigne this for one cause why riches should not be boasted of, because they are not comparable to strength, which even now I excluded from glorying.

<P>VVell, as these bee strong reasons vvhy the rich should not glorie in his riches, because they tempt thieves, and enemies: and because they are of no certainety: so there is a third reason, as vveighty as anie of those, and that is, because they do not make vs any whitte the better.
