<L>_THat which was onely priuately compos'd,</L>
<L>For your delight, Faire Ornament of Worth;</L>
<L>Is here, come, to bee publikely disclos'd:</L>
<L>And to an vniuersall view put forth.</L>
<L>Which hauing beene but yours and mine before,</L>
<L>(Or but of few besides) is made hereby</L>
<L>To bee the worlds: and yours and mine no more.</L>
<L>So that in this sort giuing it to you,</L>
<L>I giue it from you, and therein doe wrong,</L>
<L>To make that, which in priuate was your due:</L>
<L>Thus to the world in common to belong.</L>
<L>And thereby may debase the estimate,</L>
<L>Of what perhaps did beare some price before:</L>
<L>For oft we see how things of slender rate,</L>
<L>Being vndiuulg'd, are choisely held in store:</L>
<L>And rarer compositions once expos'd,</L>
<L>Are (as vnworthy of the world) condemn'd:</L>
<L>For what, but by their hauing beene disclos'd</L>
<L>To all, hath made all misteries contemn'd.</L>
<L>And therefore why had it not beene ynow,</L>
<L>That Milton onely heard our melodie?</L>
<L>Where <HI>Baucis</HI> and <HI>Philoemon</HI> onely show,</L>
<L>To Gods and men their hospitalitie:</L>
<L>And thereunto a ioyfull eare afford,</L>
<L>In mid'st of their well welcom'd company:</L>
<L>Where wee (as Birds doe to themselues record)</L>
<L>Might entertaine our priuate harmonie.</L>
<L>But fearing least that time might haue beguild</L>
<L>You of your owne, and me of what was mine,</L>
<L>I did desire to haue it knowne my Child:</L>
<L>And for his right, to others I resigne.</L>
<L>Though I might haue beene warn'd by him, who is</L>
<L>Both neare and deare to mee, that what we giue</L>
<L>Vnto these times, we giue t'vnthankfulnesse,</L>
<L>And so without vnconstant censures, liue.</L>
<L>But yet these humours will no warning take,</L>
<L>Wee still must blame the fortune that wee make.</L>
<L>And yet herein wee doe aduenture now,</L>
<L>But Ayre for Ayre, no danger can accrew,</L>
<L>They are but our refusalls wee bestow,</L>
<L>And wee thus cast the old t'haue roome for new:</L>
<L>Which I must still addresse t'your learned hand,</L>
