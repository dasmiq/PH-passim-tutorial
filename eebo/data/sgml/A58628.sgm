<P>_THE ESTATES OF PARLIAMENT now Conveened by His <HI>Majesties</HI> Soveraign Autho|rity, Taking into their Consideration, how this Nation hath continued now upwards of Two Thousand Years in the unaltered Form of Our Monarchical Government, under the un-interrupted Line of One Hundred and Eleven Kings, whose Sacred Authority and Power hath been upon all signal Occasions, so owned and assisted by Almighty GOD, that Our Kingdom hath been protected from Conquest, Our Possessions defended from Strangers, Our Ci|vil Commotions brought into wished Events, Our Laws vigorously Executed, Our Properties legally Fixed, and Our Lives securely Preserved; so that We and Our Ancestors have enjoyed those Securi|ties and Tranquillities, which the greater and more flourishing Kingdoms have frequently wanted. Those great Blessings we owe in the first place to Divine Mercy; and in dependance on that, to the Sacred Race of Our Glorious Kings, and to the solid, absolute Authority wherewith they were Invested by the first and fundamental Law of Our Monarchy; nor can either Our Records, or Our Experience in|stance&punc; Our being deprived of those happy Effects, but when a Rebellious Party did by Commotions and Seditions Invade the Kings Soveraign Authority, which was the cause of Our Prosperity, yet so far hath Our primitive constitution, and fundamental Laws prevailed against the Innovations and Seditions of turbulent Men, as that these Interruptions never terminated, but either in the Ruine, or at least the Suppression of these who at any time did Rebel or Rise in Opposition to Our Government. And since so many Ages hath assured to Us the great advantages, which flow down to all Ranks of People from the happy Constitution of Our Monarchy, and that all Our Calamities have ever arisen from seditious Inva|sions upon these Sacred Rights; THEREFORE, The Estates of Parliament for themselves, and in name of the whole Kingdom&punc; judge themselves obliged to Declare; And they Do Declare to the World, that they abhor an detest, not only the Authors and Actors of all preceeding Rebellions against the Soveraign, but likewise all Principles and Positions which are contrary, or derogatory to the Kings Sa|cred, Supream, Absolute Power, and Authority, which none, whether Persons, or Collective Bodies can participat of, any manner of way, or upon any Pretext&punc; but in Dependance on him, and Commission from him. And as their Duty formerly did bind them to owne and assert the just and legal Succession of the Sacred Line as unalterable by any Humane Jurisdiction; So now, They hold themselves on this occasion obliged for themselves, and the whole Nation Represented by them, in most humble and dutiful manner, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> the hearry and sincere Offer of their Lives and Fortunes, to Assist, Support, Defend, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> King <HI>Iames</HI> the Seventh, their present Glorious Monarch, and His Heirs, and lawful Succes|sors, in the possession of their Crowns&punc; Soveraignty, Prerogatives, Authority, Dignity, Rights, and Possessions, against all Mortals: And withall, to assure all His Enemies, who shall a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">venture on the Disloyalty of disobeying his Laws, or on the Impiety of Invading his Rights, that such shall sooner weary of their Wickedness, then they of their Duty&punc; and that they firmly Resolve to give thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> intire Obedience to His <HI>Majesty</HI> without Reserve, and to concur against all His Enemies, Forraign or Intestine. And They solemnly Declare, That as They are bound by Law, so they are voluntarly and firmly Re|solved, that all of this Nation, betwixt Sixty and Sixteen, Armed, and Provided according to their Abi|lities, shall be in readiness for His Majesties Service, where, and as o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">t as it shall be His Royal Pleasure to Require them.</P>
<P>And since the Excise of Inland and Forraign Commodities granted to King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, of ever Blessed Memory, by the 14. <HI>Act</HI> of the <HI>Parliament</HI> 1661, during all the days of his Lifetime, and Prorogate by the 8. <HI>Act</HI> of the <HI>Parliament</HI> 1681. for Five Years thereafter, will shortly Terminat. And the Estates of Parliament Considering the usefulness of this Grant, to Support the Interest of the Crown; Do as the first Evidence of their Sincerity in the foresaid Tender of their Duty, Humbly and Unanimous|ly Offer to His most Sacred <HI>Majesty</HI> King <HI>Iames</HI> the Seventh, their present Monarch, and to His Law|ful Heirs, and Successors, in the Imperial Crown of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the said Excise of Inland and Forraign Commodities, exprest in the said 14. <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> 1661 to be Collected in the manner prescribed by the said 8. <HI>Act</HI> of the <HI>Parliament</HI> 1681. for ever.

THEREFORE, His <HI>Majesty,</HI> with Consent of the Estates, Continues the Collection pre|scribed by the 14. <HI>Act, Parliament</HI> 1661, for the said Inland Excise for Six Moneths, from the first of <HI>May</HI> next allanerly.</P>
