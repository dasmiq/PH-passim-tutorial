<P>MAny in these moste pery|lous tymes, whych haue deseruingly chaunced vn+to vs for our synnes, are in such perplexite and tro+ble of conscience, that they can not tel, which waye to turne the~selfes, whom to helpe and succoure, accor+dyng to the lyttell talent that God

And truelye I would haue long agone discharged my conscience in thys parte, If I myght by any meanes haue conue|niently published and sette forth abroade those thynges, that I had prepared for the purpose. But that could not bee, whyche thynge was to me no lesse gryeuous, than if I my selfe had felte the same burde~ and payne, that I sawe my poore brethren to fele: howbeit sith, accor+dyng to the commen prouerbe, it is better late then neuer: I haue now at thys present penned or written out a litle treatyse, wherin I show briefly out of Gods boke and such auncyent wryters, as ground their sayinges vpon the same, how farre forth we oughte to bee obedyente vnto ciuill magistrates.<NOTE PLACE="marg">What is co~+tayned in thys boke.</NOTE> And thys I dyd because many are of this o|pinion, that they are bounde to do

whatsoeuer the higher powers co~+maunde them, though their lawes were directlye agaynste God and his word,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What mo|ued me to wryte here of the obe|die~ce due to magi|strates.</NOTE> in so much that they per|suade them selues that they shalbe excused by them in the dreadful dai of iudgemente, when we shall ap|peare all before god, if at anye tyme they commit manifest Idola+trye and playne vngodlynesse throughe theyr commaundement. Whom I desyer in the bowels of our sauiour Iesu Christ, who hath shedde his blood indifferently for all them, that heare his worde o|bedyently, and wythout any feare what man can doe vnto them, stike and cleaue stedfastly vnto it: that they wyll dyligently and wythout affectyon, puttyng asyde all vayne loue of their selues, looke vpon the places and examples of the holye scripture, and vpon the autorites of the olde auncyente fathers, that
<PB REF="4">
I haue here alleaged in thys my small boke, truly aunswerynge all maner of obiectyons that ar made to the contrary, then I truste, they wil be better aduised, and ceasse to please themselues in that which is euil, or to iustifie their manifest disobedyence towardes God and hys woorde, vnder the pretence and colour of the obedyence that we owe vnto hys magistrates and rulers of the earth: whom in the scriptures we are streightlye com|maunded to obeye,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Roma. 13. 1.

<P>All that ye haue sayd is true. But what doth it make for our pur+pose? For where the scryptures &amp; worde of God doeth bydde vs to obeye the hygher powers and ma|gistrates, it is not to be vndersta~|ded of those thynges, that pertein to the conscience of manne, whych

<P>As touchynge the text, that ye haue alleaged oute of the fyrste Epystell of Saint Peter,
<PB REF="9">
it oughte otherwyse to bee vnder|standed, than ye doe expounde it. Els had the blessed Apostel him|selfe done contrarye to hys owne saying: for when the rulers and el|ders of Hierusalem,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Actes. 4.</NOTE> wyth Annas the chiefe Priest, had commaunded him and Iohn, that in no wise thei should speake or teache in the name of Iesu, they would in no wise o|beye, but rather aunswered them stoutelye, sayinge: whether it bee ryght in the sight of God, to obey you more than God, iudge ye. And in an other place, he wyth the o|ther Apostles sayth plainly thus: better it is to obeye God than ma~.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Actes. 5.</NOTE> Wherfore master person, we must necessarely note here, that there be .2. kynds of ordeinaunces of man. The one aperteining to relygyon:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two ki~des of ordey|naunces of man.</NOTE> and those, wythout goddes holye worde, ar altogether vngodly, and in no wyse to be folowed. For thei
<PB REF="9">
bidde vs to worshype God, after mans fancyes and wycked inue~cy|ons of worldly wysdome, and not as he himselfe wylbe worshypped and serued. Therfore they, that fo|lowe them, shall iustlye heare thys sharpe rebuke of the heauenly wis+dome of god: this people draweth nye vnto me wyth theyr mouthes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 15.</NOTE> and honoreth me wyth their lips. Howe beit their hartes are farre from me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Esaie. 29.</NOTE> teachyng doctrynes, that are but mens preceptes. Yea the lord threatneth his people, because they feared hym throughe mens lawes and doctrynes, that he wold destroie the wisdom of their wise, and that the vnderstandynge of theyr learned men should perishe. And not wythoute a good cause doeth the Lorde threaten, that he wyll doe thus: for sithens thei doe preferre their own wisdom before the wysedome of God, doe they
<PB REF="10">
not well deserue (I praye you) to haue that wisdome, whiche God had geuen them for to bestowe to hys own glory, to be taken awaye from them? So that the saying of S. Paul is fulfilled in them, wher he sayth:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Roma. 1.</NOTE> when they counted them|selues wyse, they became fooles. For why? When they knew God, they glorified him not nor yet wor+shipped hym as god. For yf they woulde haue worshipped hym as God, they would not haue sought other maner wayes to worshyppe and serue him, than he hymselfe hath appoynted.</P>
<P>To be shorte the rewarde of the~, that wyll not submitte them selues to the euerlastyng worde of God, and serue hym after the phansyes of mens dreames,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The re|warde of mens phan+syes and dreames&punc;</NOTE> is to haue theyr foolyshe hartes blinded with vai~e imaginations, and to be geuen vp into their owne lustes. Wherefore
<PB REF="10">
I woulde counsel all men to bee|ware of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambrosi|us de virgi+nibus. li. 4.</NOTE> and to say with that holy father S. Ambrose: Nos no|ua omnia, que Christus non docuit iureda~namus: quia fidelibus via Christus est. Si igitur Christus non docuit, quod docemus, etiam nos id detestabile iudicamus. We doe by a good ryght condemne all newe thynges,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Idem in 1. Corin. 4.</NOTE> that Christe hath not taught&punc; therfore if Christ hath not taught that, which we teache, we iudge it also to be detestable. And no merueill, for in an other place he sayeth playnly, that what soeuer hath not been set forth by y^e Apostls, y^e sa~e is ful of wickednes</P>
<P>And wyl ye bynde vs to be obe+dyente to that, which is detestable and wycked?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Priest.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say stil, that subiectes ought not to busy them|selues about Princes matters. For as ye heard already, if their lawes bee naughte and wycked, then
<PB REF="11">
they their selues shall aunswere for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prentise.</SPEAKER>
<P>In dede in thynges, that appertayne to ciuill lawes, constitutions and ordeynaunces, whyche magistrates be wonte too make for the preseruatyon of the commen weale, we oughte to laye asyde all busye and curyous que|stenyng.</P>
<P>For if their lawes be not accor+dyng to iustice and equite, or if by their wicked statuts their subiects be oppressed, they shall receaue aco~+dygne punishme~t at the righteous hand of God: yea the blood of the~, y^t shal perysh through their vnrigh+teousse lawes, shalbe required at theyr handes.</P>
<P>And thys is the other kynde of ordeinaunces made by manne, wherunto, as I haue sayd before, we ought to be obedyent, and that wythoute any exceptyon, as farre
<PB REF="11">
forth as they be nothing repugna~t to godlynesse and Christian chari|tye.</P>
<P>And wythout all peraduenture S. Peter speaketh ther in the place afore alleaged of thys kynd of or|deynaunces.</P>
<P>Howbeit, if both the Greke and la+tyne be well weyed, we shal soone perceaue that Peter doeth here set forth the same selfe doctrine, which Paul himselfe doeth teache in the 13. to the Romaynes: for the Greke wordes are these: hypotagete pase anthropine ctisei, and Erasmus doeth translate them after thys maner: Subditi estote cuiuis hu|mane creature.</P>
<P>And in Englyshe they may be translated thus: be subiecte to all humayne creature, or to all menne. For although thys worde, ctisis, may be taken for ordeynaunce: yet by the texte that foloweth, it appea+peareth
<PB REF="12">
it ought rather to be taken as Erasmus hath tra~slated. Mark wel the circumstances of the texte youre selfe, and reade that, which foloweth immediatly after y^e same sentence, that ye haue broughte in: and than, I trust, ye wyll confesse my saying to be true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Priest.</SPEAKER>
<P>What foloweth I praye you? For I per|ceue y^t ye are a doctour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prentise.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would be glad to be a disciple, ma|ster person, if I could fynde such a doctour, as would teache nothyng els but true Godlynesse.</P>
<P>The woordes that folowe are these: or rather that we maye vn|derstand the whole matter the bet+ter, I wyl repete the whole se~te~ce: I meane both your texte, and that whych foloweth.</P>

<P>Submitte youre selfs vnto all maner ordynaunce of ma~, or as Erasmus translateth, to all maner creature, for the Lords sake,

whether it be vnto the king, as vn+to the chiefe heade, other vnto ru+lers, as vnto them that are sent of him for the punishment of euil do+ers, but for the laude of them that doe wel.</P>
<P>Thys texte, I trow, is playne en+ough, so that we nede no longer tarying aboute it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Priest.</SPEAKER>
<P>Saye ye what ye will, I will be of thys o|pinion as long as I lyue, that the subiectes shall bee excused beefore God, if they folowe and obey the lawes of y^e higher powers, be they neuer so wicked and vngodly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pre~+tyse.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that mayster person is a deuilyshe and abominable opinio~.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Subiectes shal not be excused, if they folow wycked &amp; vngodly lawes. Math. 15.</NOTE> Doeth not Christ say: if the blinde doe leade the blinde, they shall fall both into the diche? He sayeth not that y^e leader only or guide shal fal, but y^t they shal both fal.

<P>Doeth not the Prophete Ezechiel saye playnly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezechi. 3. &amp; 33.</NOTE> that the blood of the shepe shalbe requyred at the shepe+heardes handes? Ye wyll not deny that the higher powers in the scrip+tures and also in prophane autors ar called Pastores populi, that is to say, the shepeheardes of the peo+pell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prentise.</SPEAKER>
<P>I graunt, that they be Pastores populi: that is to say, the shepeheardes of the people, and y^t their shepes blood shalbe required at theyr handes.</P>
<P>But what shall thys be for the easemente of the poore shepe? The Prophete sayeth that they shall pe+rysh, and not only the shepeherds: whose damnacion in dede shall be the greater, because that they shall not onelye answere for their owne
<PB REF="13">
sinnes, but also for the losse of the~, that were of God committed into their handes.</P>
<P>But, as I haue already sayed, that shal bee but a small helpe and comfort for them, when they their selues, beeynge in the euerlastynge paynes of hell, whereunto they ar brought through the neglygence &amp; wicked lawes of their shepherds, shall see them to suffer greater pu+nyshment, than they dooe their selues.</P>

<P>Yeas truely. For the Psalmist sayeth not onely, that he is a greate God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalm. 95.</NOTE> but that he is a great kynge aboue all Goddes.

<P>It reioyseth my hearte to heare you speake so wel. Is it lawfull then for the rulers, kynges and Prynces of the earth to make any statutes, decrees,

<P>I wil cirst, master person, vnder youre correction and leaue, shewe what the scripture vnderstandeth by y^e keyes, and than shal any man ease+ly perceaue and see, how shamful|ly these places haue hertofore bee~ wrasted and wrighed. The keyes, sayeth that worthy Chrysostome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chriso. in math. 23. Hom. 44.</NOTE> are the worde of God and y^e know+ledge of the scriptures, whereby y^e
<PB REF="30">
gate of trueth is opened vnto me~. And the kepers of them are the Priestes, to whom the offyce of preachyng the worde and expou~|dyng the scriptures is commyt|ted. Thys is to be called the keye, wryteth saynte Augustyne, wher wyth the harde hartes are resol|ued to receaue fayth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. Ser. 27, de sanc|tis.</NOTE> the secretes of the myndes opened, and what soeuer lurketh wythin, is by a rea+sonable way broughte to lyghte, That, I say, is the true keye, that openeth the conscyence to true co~|fessyon of synne, and includeth or shutteth in grace to the eternite of an wholsome mysterie. To this a greeth that holy father Ambrose, saying:<NOTE PLACE="marg">De peni. di 1. Can. Ver+bum.</NOTE> verbum dei. The woorde of God remytteth synnes, the Priest is the iudge in deede, the Priest doth his duety and office, but he exerciseth no maner power
<PB REF="31">
nor iurisdiction. And in an other place these be hys wordes:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Liber. de cain et Abell.</NOTE> Pec|cata per verbu~ dimittuntur. Sin+nes are forgeuen by the worde, y^e interpreter wherof is the Leuite. Now is it playne and euydent en+oughe, what we oughte to vnder|sta~de by the keyes: euen the true worde of God and the righte vn+derstandynge of the scryptures: wherby the conscyences of true repentaunte synners are loosed and set at liberte from synne and euerlastyng damnacion, and y^e co~s+ciences of them, that be hardened in their wicked maliciousnes, and wyll in no wyse repente, bou~d w^t the dolefull chaynes of sinne, and of helly destructyon. And y^t thys is the true meanynge and vnder|standyng of the keies Chryst him selfe doeth sufficientlye declare, when he sendeth his apostles a|brode into the worlde, to preach y^e
<PB REF="31">
gospell, o penyng the misterye of byndynge and loosynge on thys wyse: goe ye throughoute all the whole worlde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mark. 16.</NOTE> and preache y^e gos|pel to all lyuyng creatures: here bee the keyes delyuered vnto the~: he, that beleueth and is baptysed, shalbe saued: but he that beleueth not shalbe condemned. And in the 24 chap. of Luke, Christ sayth on thys maner:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke. 24.</NOTE> thus it is wrytten, &amp; thus it behoued Chryst to suffer and to ryse agayne from death y^e thirde daye, and that repentau~ce and remission of synnes shoulde be preached in hys name amonge all nacions.</P>
<P>The woorde of God then, and the preachyng of the gospell, are the keyes y^t Chryste doeth speake of. And when the faythfull mini|sters of Gods worde doe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whst is to binde and louse.</NOTE> by due mynistryng and preachyng of y^e gospel, certifie the repentaunt sin+ners
<PB REF="32">
of the remission and forge|uenesse of their synnes in y^e bloud of our sauiour Iesu Christ, they louse them, so that they are also loused in heauen: but when on y^e contrarie they do a certayne them (because of their vnrepentaunte hartes) of the wrath and indigna+tion of God, and of euerlastinge damnation, excepte they forsake their wicked wayes, and turne vn+feynedly vnto the Lorde theyr God, they binde them so, y^t doubt lesse they ar also bound in heaue~.</P>
<P>And by thys byndyng and loo+sing Christ our sauiour vndersta~|deth none other thyng, but remit|ting and retaining of synnes. And it is saied, that the minister doth forgeue sinnes, because that he, as a man myght saye, sitting in commission vnder hys mayster Chryst, doth out of hys mouthe certifie y^e co~sciences of true repen+tau~t
<PB REF="32">
sinners of the free remissio~ &amp; forgeuenes of their sinnes in th blood of y^e so~e of god, apprehe~ded &amp; take~ hold vpo~ by faith.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prentyse.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cyrillus writing vpon Ihon, speaketh these woor|des: Truely it lyeth onely in the power of God to louse men from their synnes. For who can deliuer the transgressors of the law from synne, but onely the autour of the lawe? And by and by it foloweth in the same place: For when they (meaninge the Apostles &amp; other ministers) forgeue and retayne synnes, it is not they that do it, but the holy Ghost that dwelleth in them, he it is that forgeueth &amp; retayneth by them. Whereunto agreeth sainct Augustin, writing contra epistolam Petiliani.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. co~tra epi. Peti. lib. 2. ca. 11.</NOTE> For, hauing touched this place of S. Ihons gospell: Receyue the holy Ghoste, whose synnes soeuer ye forgeue, thei shalbe forgeuen, and whose synnes soeuer ye retayne, thei shalbe retayned, he doth ende
<PB REF="34">
the matter with these wordes: It is sufficientlye shewed, that they do it not, but that the holy Ghost doeth it by them. As it is sayed in an other place: for it is not you y^t speake, but the holye Ghoste that is in you. In lyke maner Ambrose vpon the .2. Corin. 12.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambro. in 2. Cor. 12.</NOTE> wryteth on this manner: It is only in the po|wer of God too remitte synnes &amp; to geue the holye Ghoste. And agayne: He alone doeth forgeue synne, that alone dyed for oure synnes.</P>
<P>Lykewise Chrisostome vpon Matthewe:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chryso. in Mattheu~ ho. 5.</NOTE> The seruitude and boundage of synne, sayeth he, is very greuous and heauye, frome the whiche no manne can deliuer but God onely. For no man besy|des God hathe power to remitte or forgeue synne. Cyprian in hys sermones De lapsis saieth plainly thus:</P>
<P><PB REF="35">The Lord alone can shew mercy, and geue pardon of those synnes: that are committed againste hym, he alone can graunt forgeuenesse of our synnes, that did beare our synnes, y^t sorowed for vs, whome God did deliuer vp to deathe for our synnes. Is it not than a blas|phemy intollerable, and in nowise to be suffered in y^e church of Christ that suche vyle persons, that haue neither godlinesse nor learninge, shoulde take vpon the~ that thing, that apperteineth only to god? If it were onely for this, your confes+sion is to be abhorred of all true Christian men.</P>

<P>Doeth not Christe saye these wordes:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 11.</NOTE> when ye stande to praye, forgeue, if ye haue aughte againste any man?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 6.</NOTE> Agayne&punc; if ye will not forgeue men their offen|ces, my father that is in heauen shall not forgeue you. It appereth

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prieste.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well. I will bringe
<PB REF="36">
an other texte of the scripture, whiche I truste will stoppe your mouth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioan. 11.</NOTE> When Christe did rayse Lazarus frome deathe, did not he commaunde his disciples to louse and vnbynde hym?</P>
<P>So when Christe hathe raised any synner frome the deathe of synne, who shal louse and vnbynd hym, but the priestes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prentyse.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fyrste I aunswere, that allegories are nothing worth for the confirmatio~ and establish|ment of any doctrine. Secondely, where ye saye, that Christe com|maunded his Apostles, too louse and vnbynde Lazarus, ye ca~ not proue it by the scriptures. For it is rather to be thoughte, that he willed the Iewes, that stode by, to doe it, lest they shoulde thinke, that there was anye feininge in the myracle, and that his power myghte the better bee knowen,
<PB REF="37">
in this, that he did without tou|chinge, with his worde and voice onely, rayse the dead.</P>
<P>It is rather too be expounded after this manner: Christe, to take awaye all euell suspition from the Iewes, commaunded that they should fyrst take awaie the stone, that they should smel the stynche, haue sure tokens of hys death, see hym beinge raysed agayne, by the onelye power and vertue of hys worde, and touche or handle hym first, after he was reliued. But what if we should grau~t that this was spoken vntoo the Apostles? What shoulde ye get by it?</P>

<P>That the Lorde hath ge|uen power to his Apostles, too louse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prentyse.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no mayster person, not so: for, if ye wil grou~d your selfs vpon allegoryes (as yt can do none other here) this doc|trine is rather to be gathered vpo~
<PB REF="37">
thys historie: that Christ by thys facte wolde admonish vs, that we shoulde louse theym, whome he had raysed, that is to say, that we should not beare in remembrau~ce those synnes, that he hym self had forgotten, or that we shoulde not conde~ne them as synners, whom he had quyted &amp; assoyled: agayn, that wee shoulde not vpbraye the synnes, which he him selfe hadde forgeuen: or where he is merciful hym self, and reddy too forgeue, we shoulde not be cruell, and bent to vengeaunce. Go now maister Personne, &amp; make boaste of your allegoryes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Priest.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was neuer mery with vs, sythens such ionge boyes presumed to reade the scrip+tures. What say ye to this, seing, ye are suche a doctour? Did not thei, that came to the baptisme of Ihon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 3.</NOTE> co~fesse their synnes? Why should not thei likewise, y^t come to
<PB REF="38">
receyue their housel, be shryuen?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prentyse.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ye muste marke, may|ster Personne, that Ihon prea|ched the baptisme of repentau~ce, and did baptise with water vnto repentaunce. And therfore it is no merueylle, that they, whiche came to be baptised, acknowledged or confessed themselfs too be syn|ners. For baptisme is a Sacrame~t or mysticall signe of forgeuenesse of synnes: whome then shoulde they receyue too it, but them, that acknowledge them selfs to be sin|ners? They therefore confessed theyr synnes, that they mighte be baptised.</P>
<P>But how or after what fasshio~ they co~fessed theyr synnes, where shall we learne better then in the thyrde Chapiter of the Gospell of Luke&punc;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luc. 3.</NOTE> For after Ihon had made his dreadefull sermon: the people, being striken with a feare
<PB REF="38">
of Gods righteouse iudgemente, asked hym, saying: What shall we do than? Likewise the Pub|licans and the Souldiours, that came to be baptised. Let anye in|differente manne reade the whole place throughoute. And as for your shryuinge afore the recey|uinge of the Sacramente, wolde god, that godly order, which was set fourthe in kynge Edwardes dayes, whome we maye rightwel call the flour of all Christendom, myghte hadde ben kepte and ob|serued. For in many churches, that were godlye refourmed, the Communicantes should the night before bee called together before the ministre, there to receiue most godly instructions.</P>
<P>And if any contentio~, stryfe or hatred hadde ben betwene any personnes, there shoulde hadde ben honeste agreemente made,
<PB REF="39">
or euer they had come to the Lor|des borde, all notorious and open synners beinge excluded from it. And what godly confession were they wont to make together in the face of the whole churche, afore y^e holy communion was ministred vnto them? No suche thinges are now vsed, but rather all is done contrarye to the order of the holy Ghoste, withoute any edifyinge. And this one onely thing oughte to fraye all godly men &amp; women, to be present at it. For who, being godly mynded, wolde seme w^t his presence to consente &amp; agree too y^e breaking of that order, which the holy Ghoste hath appointed and ordeyned to bee in the churche of God. But of this we will com|mone more at large, when ye shal be at better leasure.</P>

<PB REF="39">

Are not these sainct Iames woor|des?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iames. 5.</NOTE> knowledge your fautes one to an other.</P>
<P>Can ye denye, that the holye Ghost doeth here bidde, ordeyne and commaunde confession? What are all the heretykes, in all the whole worlde, able too saye a|gaynste this manifest and playne saying of this most holy Apostel?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prentyse.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ye shoulde haue rehersed the whole texte. For he did not onely saye: Confesse or knowledge youre fautes one too an other, but also, praye one for an other.</P>
<P>Whereby it must nedes folow, (seinge he commaundeth as well
<PB REF="40">
mutuall prayer, as mutuall con|fession) if we must confesse and knowledge our fautes onelye too the priestes, that we muste alsoo praye for them onely. What an ab+surditie shoulde this be? More|ouer it shoulde folowe of Iames wordes, that priestes only ought to confesse and knowledge theyr fautes one to an other. For, when Iames willeth vs too confesse or knowledge our fautes one too an other, he speaketh of such, as must heare one an others confession. For so sou~deth this Greke worde allelois, whiche is as muche too saye, as mutually or reciprocally.</P>
<P>But none, after the bishope of Romes lawe, canne or maye heare one an others confession, onelesse they bee priestes after hys holye order: and thys can bee vnderstanded but of suche, as
<PB REF="40">
oughte too knowledge their fau|tes one to an other, or heare the confession one of an other.</P>
<P>Therefore this place serueth nothinge for youre purpose. Let vs rather seeke the true meaninge of it, maister personne, that wee maye haue profit thereby.</P>
<P>The true meaninge therefore of this texte of saincte Iames is, that we oughte to knowledge our infirmities, weakenesses and fau|tes one too an other, too the ende we maye geue good, wholsome and comfortable counsaill one too an other: and knowynge in what case or state we stande all, praye one for an other moste earnestlye vnto God for the helpe and assi|staunce of hys holye spyryte, but mooste specially for the for|geuenesse of oure synnes.</P>

And it is so farre of, y^t me~ should by it lerne to feare god, that rather by it the feare of God is dryuen and clene chassed away out of their hearts.
<PB REF="42">
For when the rude &amp; simple are once perswaded, that if thei be o~ce in the yere shriuen of the Prieste, thei shal haue cleane remission of their synnes and receaue (if at lest they wilbe stil y^e children of your whoryshe mother Antichrystes church) ful absolution both a pe|na et culpa: what care they howe they lyue al the yeare long?

For why? they haue been made to be|leue, y^t al the sinnes, y^t thei confesse themselues of vnto y^t prieste, are quite &amp; clene forgeue~, &amp; put out of remembraunce before god, eue~ as

For the first questio~ almost that y^e priest vseth to aske them, y^t now at this present come to shrift, is: whether they beleue not, that y^e body of Chryst is in the sacrame~t of the aultare, fleshe, bloode, and bones, as he was borne of y^e vir|gin Mary: if they once saye nay, not only they shal not haue absolu+cion, but also they shall straighte waies be complained of &amp; accused to y^e bishop, &amp; so put in ieopardye to lose both body &amp; goods.

<P>I canne well inoughe abyde your mockes master person, saye on me what ye wyl. In the meane whiles I wil not let to tel y^e truth. First and formest there is a con|fession,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The confes+syon that we ar bou~d to make to God.</NOTE> that God wil haue too bee done vnto hym, wherein we doe daylye and hourely confesse oure synnes vnto hym, accusynge and condemnyng our selues before hi as vnrighteous and myserable synners, that oure synnes maye through his mercye, whyche we faythfully craue for, be forgeuen vnto vs.</P>
<P>And of thys confessyon doeth Dauid speake, when he sayth: I wyll knowledge my synne vnto the,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 32.</NOTE> &amp; mine vnrighteousnes haue I not hid. I sayed, I wyl confes my synnes vnto the lord, and so y^t forgaueste me y^e wickednes of my
<PB REF="45">
synne. And in the .51. psalme these be his wordes:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 51.</NOTE> haue mercy vpon me, O God, after thy great good+nes: accordynge to the multitude of thy mercyes, doe awaye myne offences. I knowledge my faulte and my synne is alway before me. Daniel in the 9. chap. of his pro|phecy maketh thys confessyon vn+to god:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dani. 9</NOTE> O Lord, y^u great and fear+ful God, we haue sinned, we haue offended, we haue been disobedi|ent &amp; gone backe, yea we haue de|parted fro~ al thy precepts &amp; iudge+mentes. And Iohn y^e Eua~geliste wryteth thus:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Ioh. 1.</NOTE> if we knowledge our synnes, God is faythfull and iust, to forgeue vs our synnes, &amp; to clense vs fro~ all vnryghteous|nes. Thys confession sayth Saint Augustine, writi~g ad Iulianu~ co|mite~, whych is done vnto God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Augu. ad Iulianu~ co+mitem.</NOTE> is required by Gods law: wher|of sayth he Sainct Iohn speaketh
<PB REF="45">
sayi~g: if we knowledge our sines &amp;c. for wythoute it synne cannot be forgeuen. And of thys doeth spryng the co~fession and acknow|ledging of the greate and vnspea|kable mercy of God. For excepte we doe truely from the botome of our hearts recognise and acknow+ledge our miserye &amp; wyckednes, we shal neuer truly confesse &amp; set forth, prayse and extoll, enhau~ce &amp; magnifie the great mercy of god, and vnspeakable goodnes of our sauiour Iesu Chryst oure Lorde, declared to vs warde. And herof it doth come, that they that haue a true feling of their own misery, &amp; of their sinnefull &amp; corrupted na|ture, hauing on the other side be+fore their eyes y^e exceading great bounteousnes of their heauenlye father: are alwayes ready to con|fesse openly their synnes in the great congregacyon. As whe~ Da|uid
<PB REF="46">
was rebuked of Nathan, he then, beyng prycked in his conscy|ence, dyd say:<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Regu. 2.</NOTE> Peccaui domino, I haue synned vnto thee lord. As if he should saye: I dooe not excuse my self, nor I refuse not to be cou~+ted of al men a synner, or to haue that to be published abroade a|mong men, whych I woulde had to be~ hydden affore. And for thys cause god dyd in tymes passed or+deyne emong the Israelites,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leui. 16.</NOTE> that the people should openly in y^e te~|ple confesse theyr synnes. For god did foresee this to be a very neces+sary meane, wherby they should be broughte into the true knowe|ledge of themselues. And it is also most conuenient, that by acknow+ledging our misery we should sett forth the goodnes and mercye of God emong vs, and publyshe it openly before al y^e world. O how Godly was this do~e in king Ed|wards
<PB REF="46">
tyme? whensoeuer the peo+ple of god gathered themselues together, to offer their spirituall sacrifices,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Augusti. de vera &amp; falsa peni|tentia. ca. 11</NOTE> and to make their com|mon prayers vnto him. S. Augu|styne de vera et falsa penitentia cap. 11. maketh mencyon of an ope~ or publike confession, whyche he defineth after thys maner. Ope~ or publike confession is, wherby in tymes passed they, that were dead in open synnes, declared the~+selues to be dead, publishing open+ly theyr death, &amp; shewyng ope~ly y^e fruites of repe~tau~ce, y^e the people myght bewayle him y^t was lost. Thys was in dede the wont and custom of the old au~cient church, when any man had co~mytted any notorious cryme or fault, that he should be exco~municated and put out of the co~gregacion, til he had earnestly repented &amp; in toke ther|of co~fessed his synne openly in y^e
<PB REF="47">
face of y^e whole churche. But thys wholsome kynde of confessyo~ is cleane abolyshed, &amp; in steade ther of an apyshe momerye crepte into the churche. S. Paul semeth to speake of it, in the 1. Cor. 5. &amp; in the 2. Cor. 2.</P>

The one we vse for our own sake, when we beeyng troubled in co~s|cyence, doe open our griefe vnto our neighbour, to y^e ende he maye helpe &amp; coumfort vs, w^t some god+ly &amp; wholsome counsel. And as touchyng thys kynde of co~fessio~, though by gods worde we haue liberte to open our conscyence &amp; to shewe oure griefe to any of our Christen brethren, who~ we thinke
<PB REF="47">
to be able to cou~sel &amp; co~fort vs: so if y^e pastours or shepeheardes bee me~ of godlynes &amp; learning, and of a pure &amp; sounde iudgemente, we ought most specially in y^e trouble &amp; angours of the conscience to re|sort or flye vnto the~, that accordi~g to their office, they may in time minister y^e co~fortable salfe of gods word vnto our wou~ded co~scie~ces. For they are ordeyned &amp; institu|ted of God for the same purpose: therfore ought we most chyefelye to come vnto the~, that so we may enioye those spiritual benefytes, that God of his mere mercy and goodnes doeth daylye offer vnto vs by the~.

but to blaspheme God and hys worde, yea men that are ready, in stede of geuing good and whol|some counsell, to cut all mennes throtes, that will not consent and agree to their abominacion &amp; stin+kyng blasphemyes. Gregorye, as we haue in the decrees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gregorye. De peni. di+sti. 6.

How largely, when they syt bybbynge vpon their ale benches, they talke of those thynges, that they haue heard vnder benedicite, it is to shamful to tel. The fathers of the west churche would neuer confes their synnes vnto them, of whom they coulde not be taughte nor in|structed to godlynes; but ye wyll
<PB REF="48">
haue vs to confesse our selues to them, that haue no more learnyng than dull headed asses. Oh that those holy Canons mought take place, which wil vs to shu~ne those gostly fathers 'that are blyndon+ly and ignoraunte of gods way: in so muche that they appoynte, that we shold rather confesse our selues to our neyghbour, beeyng a lay man, than vnto that Priest, that wanteth both learnynge and iudgemente. The other kynde of confession is, that we make for our neighbours sake, to reconcyle hym vnto vs, if we haue offe~ded hym in any maner of thynge. Of thys kynde of confessyon dooeth our sauyour Iesus Chryst speake when he sayth: if, whe~ y^u offerest thy gyfte at the aultar, y^u doest re|member, y^t thi brother hath aught agai~st the:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 5.</NOTE> leue ther thy gift, &amp; goe thy way, be first reco~ciled to thy
