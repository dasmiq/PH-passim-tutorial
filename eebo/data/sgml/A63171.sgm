<P>_THE Barges belonging to the severall 12. Companies, are with the Morning-tide carried up the River from <HI>White hall</HI> to <HI>Chelsey,</HI> beginning with the <HI>Mercers, Grocers, &amp;c.</HI> and ending with the inferiour Compa|nies, who are placed at <HI>Chelsey</HI>; most of the Barges are attended with a Pageant, some more richly set out then the rest, but none remisse in shewing something of Affection and Loyalty.</P>
<P>The Pageants are placed at the head of every Barge. That which at|tends the <HI>MERCERS</HI> is thus set forth. Under a Canopy of State is seated a <HI>Virgin,</HI> on her head a Silver Coronet. Her Garment of Violet colour'd Sattin, over which is a large cloth of Silver Mantle.</P>

<P>Her Pages are habited in Cloath of Silver Doublets, and Velvet Bree|ches, in their Hats Plumes of Feathers, and in their Hands severall Ban|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ers and Escutcheons.</P>
<P>They are placed three of each side the Pageant.</P>
<P><HI>The DRAPERS Pageant is thus set forth.</HI> Under a Canopy of State is represented a Grave <HI>Roman</HI> Magistrate, habited in a long Robe, on his

head a Helmet, in his right hand he holds a Scepter, in his left a Triple Crown, a Sword girt to him. His Attendants are four, <HI>Loyalty, Truth, Fame,</HI> and <HI>Honour. Loyalty</HI> and <HI>Truth</HI> are placed in the Front, at the two Corners; <HI>Fame</HI> and <HI>Honour</HI> at the two Rear Corners.</P>
<P><HI>Loyalty</HI> is habited like a Grave Citizen, plain and decent; in one hand he holds a Banner of the Armes of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Portugall</HI> impal'd, in the other hand a Sword, signifying his resolution to defend their Right.</P>
<P><HI>Truth</HI> is habited in white, on her head a wreath of Stars; in one hand she bears a Banner of the Companies Armes, in the other a little Book.</P>
<P><HI>Fame</HI> is represented in a long loose light Robe, his head circled with a wreath of intermixed Colours; in one hand he holds a Trumpet, in the other a wreath of Laurell, as intended for Loyalty.</P>
<P><HI>Honour</HI> is habited in Cloath of Gold, on his head a Hat and Plume of Feathers; in one hand he holds a Shield, in which is figured a <HI>Portuges</HI> with a Sword drawn, holding it over some <HI>India<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> there, figured kneeling; in the other he bears an Escutcheon, with the Armes of <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">gland</HI> and <HI>Portu|gall</HI> impal'd.</P>
<P><HI>The MERCHANT TAILORS Pageant is thus set forth.</HI> The Stage (being 12. foot long, and 7. foot broad) is Arched with a wild Arbour, made in manner of a Wildernesse.</P>
<P>The two Camels (supporters of the Companies Arms) are back'd with two <HI>Indians,</HI> bearing in one hand an Escutchion of the Arms of <HI>Eng|land</HI> and <HI>Portugall</HI> impal'd. In the other hand they hold Darts down|wards, betokening subjection, Their Motto
<Q>LUSITANIAE ORIENS ET MERIDIES&punc;</Q></P>
<P>There are two Moores, that attend the Camels, as their guiders.</P>
<P>In the Wildernesse is seated an Aged Man, representing a Pilgrim, and habited accordingly. In one hand he holds a Staff, in the other a Banner, bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ing the Figure of a Golden Lamb, with this Motto,
<Q>INTER NOCENTES INNOCENS.</Q></P>

<P><HI>The GOLDSMITHS Pageant is thus set out.</HI> Under a Canopy of State sits <HI>Iustice,</HI> her hair dishevell'd.

In one hand they hold a golden Hammer, in the other a golden Cup.</P>
<P>It would be too tedious to insert here the bravery of the rest of the Pa|geants, and being streigthned in point of time, I shall omit it.</P>
<P>The Barges are anchored some 40. or 50. yards distant in the middle of the River, behind them is left an open passage for Boats to passe, this side of the River is kept clear for their Majesties, and their Trayn.</P>
<P>Between 8. and 9. of the Clock, the Lord Mayor and Court of Alder. men, move towards <HI>Chelsey,</HI> where they attend their Majesties comming from <HI>Putney,</HI> and then the Lord Mayor leads the way down the River be|fore their Majesties.</P>
<P>The Grand Pageants appointed for this day are placed thus: The First at <HI>Chelsey</HI>; The second between <HI>Fox-hall</HI> and <HI>Lambeth</HI>; The third at the private Staires at <HI>Whitehall</HI></P>
<P>Those thr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e entertain their Majesties with Speeches, in their motion to <HI>Whitehall.</HI></P>
<P>There are two Drolls, one of Watermen the other of Seamen, continu|ally imployed in dancing and singing.</P>

<P ID="WT218-NOTE-001">^a <HI>Leander</HI> was a famous Youth that dwelt in <HI>Abydus,</HI> a place si|tuate upon the opposite shore of <HI>Sestos,</HI> the place where <HI>Hero</HI> lived, a Beautiful Maid; To her <HI>Leander</HI> swimming by night over <HI>Helles|pont</HI> (a part of the Sea in <HI>Asia</HI>) a storm arose and drowned him. By <HI>Leander</HI> we may see the violent passion and servency of Love, that neither water could quench, nor the roaring of the waves terrifie: As <HI>Virgil</HI> (the best of Poets) in his <HI>Georgicks</HI> l. 3. takes occasion to mention.</P>
<P ID="WT218-NOTE-002">The ^b Swans are said to sing a little before they die, which is called an <HI>Epecedean,</HI> or Funerall Song.</P>
<P ID="WT218-NOTE-003">By ^c <HI>Vertumnus</HI> is meant the Year, returning into it self from the middle or end of <HI>September,</HI> to <HI>September</HI> again; Every moneth he assumes a new shape, wherefore he is by some thought to be <HI>Proteus,</HI> by reason of his often changes, which is said he did to Court <HI>Pomona</HI> the Goddesse of Fruits: In the Spring he appears more Lovely then in any other season of the Year, and there|fore he had usually offered (and is still attributed) to him the first Flowers of the Gardens; He is the aptest for his beloved <HI>Pomona</HI> in <HI>September</HI> and <HI>October,</HI> the return of his course, for then she likes him best.</P>
<P ID="WT218-NOTE-004">^d <HI>Hyems</HI> is the Father of Frosts, and nipping cold, the sharpest part of Winter, it alludes to decreppid Age, and is painted like an Old man with Crutches.</P>
<P><HI>Isis</HI> having ended her Speech, their MAjESTIES Train pass by another view or Pageant, in the nature of a Droll of Water|men, placed not far distance from that of <HI>Isis</HI>; in their passage the Watermen, who are continually in action, consort into this Song, being set for three parts.</P>

<P>By the Chariot, is meant the swift motion of the Sea, and by the diver|sity of her Attendance, are understood the various sorts of Fishes, which are said to wait upon the Sea Gods and Goddesses, because they have their being and habitation in the Sea; But <HI>Tritons</HI> are commonly taken for <HI>Nep|tunes</HI> Trumpeters, and sometimes for Sea Monsters. <HI>Thetis</HI> was also mar|ried to <HI>Peleus</HI> an excellent Navigator, and therefore is presented with gray hairs, which is partly to intimate the Antiquity of Navigation, and partly to shew the cares and fears of Seamen, who are observed to become sooner Gray hair'd then others.</P>
