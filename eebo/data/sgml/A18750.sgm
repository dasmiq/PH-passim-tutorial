<HEAD>&para; TO THE RIGHT honorable my singuler good Lorde, the Lorde Norrice: Thomas Church-yard wisheth blessednesse of life, muche honor in the worlde and the beste happe can bee desired.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_MY good lorde the fauor and Noble dealynges towards me in the da|yes you were lorde em|bassadour in Fraunce, when your aide and pollicie (by meane of a passeport) conuayed me from dan|ger to the Prince of Orrange, made me often remember that sutche courtesies with good will or seruice should bee re|quieted.</HI>
<PB REF="3">
<HI>But hauyng small power for the publishyng of duetie, and little abi|litie to requite a good tourne (wat|chyng occasion to bee gratefull) I take suche matter as tyme doeth minister for a furtherer of my expectation, and a meane to encrease my credite with your lordship. And consideryng whe~ dolefull newes was brought of one of your chee|fest sonnes dedde in Irelande, I wrote a heauie Epitaphe, I thought now hea|ryng greate and goodnewes of another (both in nature and valliancie brother to the eldest who GOD hath called) to make a pece of ame~ds, for the saluyng of my first presumption, &amp; the throughly expressyng of my present desire of due|tifull doyng. So my good Lorde leauyng</HI>
<PB REF="3">
<HI>circumstance of wordes and filed phra|ses of florishyng ceremonies, I fall to my purposed matter. It hath been an olde maner, and a newe finenesse in this cun|nyng worlde, that sutche as could pur|chace praise or commendation by their owne practises (either by pen or tong) would reape the glorie thei could get to themselues, and leaue out the fame of o|thers, if trothe by tract of tyme reueled not rightfull causes, and gaue eche well doer the reward of their workes, then if those maners of menne, finenesse of the worlde, &amp; greedinesse of glorie runnes awaie with hast to their owne commo|ditie, and no benefite to others: Blame not any nation (properly giuen to their priuate praise) to tread doun the laude</HI>
<PB REF="4">
<HI>and honor of any strange people, neither borne in their Countrey, nor commyng to their soile, but to serue for money &amp; sutche report of fame, as the Countrey maie spare from them selues to the Sol|diours, that serue for these twoo causes before rehearsed. Not withstanding be|cause the eager myndes of menne (that bites at euery blaste of fame) shall not breed by their boldnesse, neither abuse nor ill custome, whereby the estimation of forwardmen should be hindered, nor the quicke forwardnesse of vainglorie should not finde too mutche occasion to triu~ph on the aduantage of tyme, I haue now tyme as I thinke with trothe and good laisure, written sutche intellige~ce to the worlde of the taking of Macklin,</HI>
<PB REF="4">
<HI>as I hope shal serue for a testimonie that my penne is euer honestly occupied, and that no writer maie willingly (if lice~ce permit) suffer further report of newes to be published, then the wise of the world alloweth, &amp; the generall opinions of men maie embrace. Thus wishing truthe al|waies (as a torche to burne on the topp of a hill) to bee looked on, and affections of men to bee tried and wrested to the beste constructions of that whiche beste becomes a good worlde to heare, I pre|sent to your Lordship the true reportes I haue heard for the winnyng of Ma|cklin, and sutche thynges as there hap|pened at Macklins mischance: written not for that sutche matter (or a greate deale greater) can bee hid from a noble</HI>
<PB REF="5">
<HI>man of your callyng. But presented to keepe my acquaintaunce with my good freendes, and cause the worlde to ima|gine I was borne vnder a Marcial pla|net and signe: and neither spareth pen, studie, nor paines to prefarre Marciall people, and honour the worthiest sorte of men. So hopyng your Lordship lookes on my willyng mynde to dooe well, and turnes your face fro~ the defectes of my base phrase and writyng: I wishe your honor daiely to encrease, with the bles|syng of God vpon your house and chil|dren.

<HEAD>Macklins mischance.</HEAD>
<P>_AS eche Countrey and Nations seekes their owne credite and ad|uauncement, so hardly any forrain soldier rea peth fame in a strange sovle he serueth in: I meane an En|glishe man seruyng out of his owne Countrey (ioyned with straungers in action) standes at reward of common report, or is subiecte to the affection of the people where he serueth, who re|gardes more their owne estimation, then the fame of a forraine Soldier, which soldier rather for fame then re|warde, goes from the natiue soile he was borne in, and serueth a straunge people for a small peece of money, but yet a great portion of praise and good
<PB REF="6">
renowne. This not spoke~ nor applied to the discredite, and hindrance of any straungers well doyng, but in the de|fence and seruice of the Englishe Na|tion, whose labour, charge, courage, readinesse, and warlike mindes, is not inferiour to the greatest neighbours, (or furthest of you can name) nere vs, in any Marciall order, maner, disci|pline of warre, or hazard of life.</P>
<P>And for a profe of these special poin|tes herein rehersed, the moste warres of christendome beares suche testimo|niall and witnesse of their foreward|nesse (though here at home God bee praised is peace) that few or none hath been so forward in the feeld, nor more daungerously serued. Then iniurie it were, and cleane against good nature of men, and order of armes, that any nation for their owne glory (vaine as a shadowe) should eclips the dezartes and valiauncie, of the Englishe now seruyng in Flanders, drawne thether
<PB REF="6">
for fame (and their owne desires to do well) and liue from debt of the worlde and daunger of the Lawe. In whose commendation, and for the trothe of matter now penned, vnder good will of the wise, and sounde iudgemente of the world, I enter into a discourse and plaine order of the takyng of <HI>Macklin,</HI> dispraisyng no Nation at the seruice, nor leauyng out no matter is true, be|cause trothe is to bee embraced, and matter depending of flatterie or affec|tion, is vtterly to be disalowed.</P>
<P>It happened I beyng at the Court (where the trothe of many thynges is moste certain) I sawe a letter written out of Flaunders, from the handes of a gentilman, whose eyes beheld the ve|ry seruice and enterprise, and the win|nyng of the great toune of <HI>Macklin,</HI> and the letter was so well penned, &amp; went so directly to the matter (in euery point and order) touchyng the particulars and generall takyng of the same citie,
<PB REF="7">
that I was forced by the credite of the gentilman that wrote (and by proba|ble confirmation of sonderie other re|portes) to beleue the letter to be moste true, and worthie the rehearsall to the open world. But amased at the stran|genesse of the hazard, and wonderyng not a little at the attempt (which was maruelous) I bethought me how the Spanyardes vpo~ a resolution emong themselues sodainly set vpon <HI>Antwarp,</HI> and in a smal season had the people at their mercie, and toune at their plea|sure: and yet me thought this enter|prise for the winnyng of <HI>Macklin,</HI> sur|passed all the exploites that euer be|fore I heard of, or in deede throughly vnderstode. Tha~ waiyng how sleigh|tly I had gone ouer the Seruices of Flaunders, in a booke called my <HI>Choice</HI> knowyng that I had forgotten bothe maister Norris, maister Ca~dish, mai|ster worke, and a nomber of others ve|rie valiaunte gentilmen, that merites
<PB REF="7">
more praise then my pen can giue the~. I thought to make amendes with the nexte woorke I should set out, and so peisyng in the ballance of an vpright iudgemente, the weight and value of the valiauncie of men, and the inuinsi|ble courages that resolute soldiours dooeth shewe. I tooke an accasion to publishe the letter I haue spoken of, and to stretche out the fame and ho|nour of my countreymen, that other|wise might be darkned by disdaine, or drouned in forgetfulnesse, for want of true recorde that proceadeth from the penne of an honest writer, who iustlie maie be bold without blushyng, to re|port that he heareth, and maie be pro|ued to be true. In the warrs betwene the Prince of Orrange and the <HI>Malle contants,</HI> for causes I nede not to touch <HI>Mounsire de Fammai, and Mounsire de Tem|ple,</HI> beyng as some saie, the drawers of a drift, &amp; to be at some execution of the practice, as appeareth by many mens
<PB REF="8">
opinio~s, the ix. of Aprill earely at a de|termined howre, by the consentes and deuises of suche as gouerned in Mar|ciall affaires. Maister Ihon Norrice with seuen Enseantes, beeyng but eight hundreth Englishmen (or some|what more) he Collonell of those com|panies, with the aide of the Scottes and Wallons fower hundreth, appro|ched in orderly marche and manner (without sound of Dromme) nere the walles of <HI>Macklin, Monsire de Famai</HI> pro|misyng before that the Soldiours (on his honor) should haue fiue monethes paie for their further encouragemente to that and all other the like seruices.</P>
<P>And these whole companies appro|ched, and deuidyng them selues some for the skalle in one place, and some in an other, the one parte with Boates well manned, and the other wadyng verie depely to enter vpon the skalyng Ladders, some negligence or haste by some not spoken of, had almoste dis|couraged
<PB REF="8">
the whole attempte: And in the ende failed their footyng, and for|ced Maister Norrice and the power with hym, to aduaunce theim selues towardes the enemie, and dwell vp|pon their gard (with the losse of some|tyme) before the face of the Toune, whiche by meanes of noyes and <HI>Ala|rum</HI> the daie beyng come, was in a rea|dinesse for defence, and shotte of their peeces to their moste aduauntage, and the assailantes discourage, defendyng a Courtaine verie stoutly, against the whiche Courtain maisier Ihon Nor|rice was faine to drawe fiue hundreth shotte, not meanyng thereby to enter. For the Boates by mischaunce of vn|ladyng of them were drouned, and the fiue hu~dred shot was drawne to this one place, to procure the people in the toune to repaire thether, whiles some apointed for purpose, at an other place should enter with more ease and lesse daunger. But those that were putt to
<PB REF="9">
the plonge for to wade, found the wa|ter so deepe, that it came aboue their shulders: a matter to bee marueled at, a harde aduenture, and a sore escape: But by that meanes thei found awaie to enter by Ladder at a Gate, where thei passed fiue seuerall tymes with some small power, but could enter no more but one persone at once. Yet hap serued so well, no resistaunce in that corner was made, till three hundreth of the Englishe soldiours had posses|sed a peece of the toune: And then the Albanoies horse menne, thinkyng to breake through the force of footemen, charged them. So suche as foolishely aduentured to farre of the footemen, fell into the daunger of the Albanoies, whereon the horsemen gaue an other charge, and tastyng with their bolde|nesse the pushe of the Pike, and seeyng the Englishe stande stoutly at defence, the Albanoies wheeled about, and for|sooke that maner of fighte, with the
<PB REF="9">
losse of diuers of their horsemen.</P>
<P>After which repulce the Albanoies had no mynde any more to come so nere daunger, whereby the Burgoes of the toune beganne to quaile, and stoode in a little mase and doubt of the matter. Then the whole tounes men and soldiours forsooke the rampiers and manned bothe brigges and strea|tes as well as thei might: in this sea|son and hard fight bothe doubtful and dangerous. The Englishe, Scottish, and all the other Soldiours for that attempt presente, hauyng passed ouer the gates, walles, and places of rea|diest entrie, marched forewardes (cri|yng a noble woorde) and founde great resistaunce at the ende of euery streate by whiche sharpe encounter thei were faine by little and little (as Fortune serued their hopes) to winne their ground with some losse of Soldiours who mynded more victorie, then co|wardlie to retire, and at the laste with
<PB REF="10">
mutche a doe and long bickeryng (the tounes menne for their libertie and li|ues, and the assailantes for fame and conqueste) thei came in vewe of the Market place, where the tounes men and their stoutest companies stood in order of battaile, euery waie flancked with ordinaunce: But as the French man faieth, <HI>Il falloit aualler cela,</HI> the Sol|diours meanyng to trie what For|tune durste dooe, gaue a lustie charge, and by Gods helpe, and the greate courage of sonderie stoute gentilmen, and officers of credite and value, thei had the vpper hande of their enemies, with whom thei made as short worke as thei might: But in deede before ap|paraunte victorie could any waie bee knowne, greate struggling and stoute sturre on bothe sides was seen&punc; and maister Ihon Norrice was matched with a lustie Limlifter, a breachlesse Freer called Brother Peter, the one|ly manne that made and maintained
<PB REF="10">
all the broile and businesse, who had put on a resolute mynde, either to kille Maister Norrice, or els to bee slaine hym self, and dealt blowes so brauelie in this his determination, that he hitt maister Norrice with a Halbert two full thwackes on the Curate, whiche blowes wer sone reuenged by maister Norrice, who dispatched y^e Freer, and gaue hym a dedde paie in recompence of his paines. This gallaunte Freer thus slain, ended all the strief and bio|die braule: for then euery one cried <HI>Mi|sericorde,</HI> and fell pitifully at the feete of the Soldiours, who findyng victorie vsed not mutche extremitie. For the nomber of all those that were slaine were not aboue twoo hundreth per|sones: one letter declareth that the go|uernoure with the Albanoizes, dis|pairyng a little before the ouerthrowe fledde (out at a backe Porte or Po|sterne) to Louaiu and so saued their li|ues: another letter saith the gouernor
<PB REF="11">
was taken prisoner. Oure Englishe Nation loste in their companie a fif|teene Commoners, but as I beleeue thei were all gentilmen Soldiours. For to the nomber of thirtie Englishe men were slaine, and fower score sore hurte: whiche argues of eight hun|dreth, one hundreth and more were likelie to haue paied their liues for their enterprise. And further the losse or hurtyng of so many oure Nation, manifestly declares that thei did most of the seruice, and deserues therefore the moste honor: how so euer the prin|tyng of the firste newes bee taken and vnderstoode, one Maister Smithe, twoo valiaunte Lieutenantes, Mai|ster Humfrey Turner an Enscante, Maister Iones a gallant yong Sol|diour, were worthely seen serue, and slaine in the action. By a misfortune after the fight Maister Whitchurche, and Maister Heddleis brother of the Garde was slaine: and of all the other
<PB REF="11">
Nations that came with the English, as yet can be knowne was but twoo persones slaine in the enterprise.</P>
<P>Nowe yet I praie you, heare what an other man of good credite wrote of this matter, who stoode and plainely behelde the seruice from the begin|ning to thende. The power of twelue hundreth in all, whereof eight hun|dreth were Englishemen, set forward from Filforde and came to <HI>Macklin,</HI> as eager as Haukes that seeketh their praie, wadyng to the chinne, and cli|myng ouer Iron gates, as men that cared not for life, so fame might be got|ten. Yea surely saieth he, the strengthe of the toune considered, there was ne|uer vnder the cope of heauen, suche an enterprise taken in hand, and brought to so glorious a victorie. For saieth he though very good captaines might af|ter long fight &amp; hurtes forsake the as|sault, these soldiers wer so desirous of seruice, that thei would not in any cace
<PB REF="12">
at no tyme retire, and beeyng entered the toune but a very fewe, thei fought it out so manfullie, that maister Rou|lande Yorke s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ept into the water, wa|dyng after them to their succour: And at the present displaiyng of his Ense|ant, he loste his Lieutenant, his Ser|geante, and Maister Iones his En|seante bearer, and he hym self shotte through his Dublette, and Maister Norrice not as a Collonell, but as a common Soldiour, ledde his Soldi|ors the waie through thicke and thin, where moste daunger appeared. And encountered Frier Peter, who was cheef leader of all the Priestes in the toune, he was in daunger to be slaine, for the Frier firste shotte of his peece, then he tooke him to his Pike or Hal|berte, and laste fell to his sworde, and so like a couragious Confessour val|liauntly lost his life. And when all the broyle was in a maner ended, he saith that looked vpon all these dooynges,
<PB REF="12">
<HI>Mounsire de Temple,</HI> &amp; <HI>Mounsire de Fammai</HI> came to the toune, or were peraduen|ture about the toune nere the seruice, for the aunsweryng their hope, and furthering of the matter expected. Yet haue thei no sutche cause to bee writ|ten of, as those that wer the onely exe|cutioners of the seruice in deede: wher fore the firste printed booke of this ne|wes must be wayed, accordyng to the trothe and vmore of the matter.</P>
<P>After the toune was wonne, Mai|ster Norrice did what he might too keepe his people from pillage, but in the meane while Temples men ioy|nyng with the Scottes gotte the best booties: wherevpon the Englishmen fell to take that easely might bee had, either of Churchmen or Cloister hou|ses, but especially thei searched the Cloisters and Religious places, sai|yng thei were Inquisitors for to seeke out Copes, Surpleses and Uestinen|tes, and to take so good an order by
<PB REF="13">
their Commission, that no Masse should bee songe nor saied in <HI>Macklin</HI> many a long yere after, for wante of gilted Challices, and golden Copes.</P>
<P>And the Shrine of Sainct Tom|ball was so terriblie handeled, that it was bothe remoued out of his place, and left not worthe a pennie. And the Soldiours were so wealthie, that the olde custome of the Spaniardes was taken vp againe, for Dice plaie began so merrilie on the toppe of Drommes heddes, that money could not tarrie in the bothome of mens purses. Men that haue by their forwardnes found sutche good Fortune, are to bee excu|sed though thei merrilie passe a little money a waie at Dice: Declaryng by that pastime whiche standeth on good happe to winne, or euill lucke to lose. The whole <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> of manne standeth but on hazarde and chance: a matter that soldiours doe mutche marke, and the worlde can not denie. But for all their
<PB REF="13">
plaiyng at Dice (whiche Soldiours will not bee varred from) their Capi|taines and Leaders, as it is reported, had more regard to that whiche was so hardly gotten, and yet to redeeme a Capitaine out of prison, maister Nor|rice hath paied a greate somme of mo|ney, whiche money was moste noblie employed: my freende good Capitaine Morgane that now is in <HI>Macklin,</HI> will I warrant you confesse the same whe~ he is asked. An other poincte of honor is to bee spoken of. For when a Non|rie in the toune was readie to be spoi|led, Maister Norrice hearyng that some Englishe women were emong the Noonnes, defended theim from harme, and sette them free, and vsed o|ther courtesies more, that is worthie the noting. When I heard of this no|ble parte of a Soldiour, I remembred how a greate conquerour, in a maner of the moste parte of the worlde, ha|uing <HI>Darius</HI> wife and a nomber of gal|launte
<PB REF="14">
Ladies vnder his mercie: vsed hymself so honourably towardes his captiues, that for feare to bee tempted with their beauties, he would not scarce come where thei were, and yet were the prisoners so reuerentlie and honestly vsed (beyng women of greate callyng and birth) that <HI>Darius</HI> thought hym self happie (though vnfortunate Prince he was) to bee conquered of sutche a noble kyng as <HI>Alexander,</HI> who could not onely conquer his owne af|fections, but winne his enemies har|tes by his fauourable and Princelie dealynges: And surely greater honor is gotte~ by vsyng victorie wiselie, then by ouerthrowyng a multitude with manhoode, without shewyng mercie and gentilnesse. A conquerour by re|pressyng crueltie by courtesie, is hadd in admiration of his verie enemies, and a victor without vertue and piti|full consideration, is hated emong his freendes, and despised generally emo~g
<PB REF="14">
all kinde of people. Nowe you muste note that the Englishemen, and suche as entered the toune by hazard, furie of shotte, danger of sworde, and pushe of the Pike, are not a little to bee ho|noured and praised, and more to bee commended then thousandes of those that stood a farre of, and gaue but the lookyng on. And you maie see by the same some menne are happie, not one|ly to passe through many perilles, but likewise to liue long, and make theim selues and their soldiours ritche: and cause the fame of their Countrie to be spred as farre as the winde can blow, or the Sunne maie shine. And the more happie be our Englishemen and Scottes men, with all the reste of this attempte, that thei dwell as yet in the place thei haue taken, and mynde not to parte there fro, till the poore Sol|diours bee pleased. And the keepyng the saied Toune in their handes all this while, argues thei haue deserued
<PB REF="15">
too haue the charge thereof, though <HI>Mounsire Fammai</HI> beare the name to bee the Gouernour of <HI>Macklin.</HI></P>
<P>Thus haue you heard the effecte &amp; rehersall of two letters, sent into En|glande from those in Flaunders, that sawe <HI>Macklin</HI> bothe wonne and loste, which commyng to light and to the o|pen eye of the worlde, showes that all tounes, fortresses, and holdes (bee thei neuer so stro~g) are subiect to sodain o|uerthrowes, and in the deuine disposi|tion of the Almightie, who visiteth a nomber of our neighbours, with ma|ny kindes of callamities, to make vs beare in mynde his Omnipotente po|wer, and our owne dueties to GOD and our Prince. This peece of ser|uice I haue touched, because euery Nation prefarres their owne Coun|triemen, and the Englishe doe thei ne|uer so well, and be the first at a breach (or at the saulte of a Toune) thei are the last shalbe spoken of, and the worst

rewarded) especially where beste thei deserue, and moste should be made of. I feare it is some mennes Deastenie, neither at home nor abroade to reape no benefite of their labours. So for this season I bid you farewell, myn|dyng hereafter to shewe other serui|ses that are forgotten in my booke of <HI>Choice,</HI> that was ouer hastely Printed, and must be runne ouer againe, bothe for the fame of some therein lefte out, and the troth of some matters I was wrong instructed of. And to keepe the people in some good likyng of me and my woorkes. I am presently settyng out a discourse of the late yeartquake, not touched of any writer in Englishe here tofore: Though some haue tou|ched many good pointes to bee noted, bothe learnedlie and louynglie with duetifull order, declared to God and the worlde.
