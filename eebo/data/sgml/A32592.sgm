For the remedying whereof, no better means hath been offered to Us, then by re-erecting a Corporation of the most discre&eacute;t persons experien|ced in the making of Starch, who may be enabled to make Laws and Ordinances for the regulating the said Abuses and Inconveniencies; We therefore following the example of Our Royal Predecessors herein, by Our Letters Patents under Our Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> have Incorporated sundry me&eacute;t persons of the said Trade of Starch-making, with power and priviledges to them and their Successors, to make or cause to be made in one joynt stock, and not otherwise, in such convenient place or places, as shall be appointed by Us, Our Heirs or Successors, or six of Our Privy Council, and not elswhere, All and all manner of White-Starch with Bran and Pollard onely, or with Wheat-Corn or Grain imported from beyond the Seas, or with musty, defective, and un|wholsome Corn, unfit for the Food of Man; and not of any wholsome Corn or Grain of the growth of this Realm of <HI>England,</HI> and the same to put to sale at reasonable prices; and to Rule, Order, and Govern the Members of the said Corporation; and to make Orders and Rules for the well-ordering the said Starch-Trade thoroughout Our Realm of <HI>England,</HI> Dominion of <HI>Wales,</HI> and Town and Port of <HI>Berwick;</HI> and to search and try all Starch that shall be made by any Member of the said Corporation, and all materials for the making of the same: And fur|ther Granting by Our said Letters Patent, That no person or persons whatsoever, not being Fre&eacute; of the said Cor|poration,
