<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Should be very ungrateful
for the many extraordinary
Favors, which Your Lord|ship
has often shower'd upon me,
if I omitted studying all man|ner
of ways to lay my Faithful
Acknowledgments at Your Feet,
who have so often been pleas|ed
to honor me with Your Con|versation,
and several of the
following <HI>Poems</HI> with Your Al|lowance,
<PB REF="3">
and Applause: And
since a POET can no better
way express his Gratitude, than
by an humble Address and De|dication
of his Endeavors, be
pleased, My Lord, to accept this
Book, as a Tribute due to un|common
Merit; and as an Of|fering
of Thanks, for the Value
Your Lordship is pleased to set
on POETRY in General.</P>
<P>My Lord, You not only Grace
and Dignifie my unworthy <HI>Poems</HI>
by Your Noble Patronage, but
are an Honor to the Age You
live in, by shewing such an Ex|ample;
the Love and Inclina|tion
You have to Wit and In|genuity,
sufficiently demonstra|ting
<PB REF="3">
your Own Worth, for since
nothing can more Illustrate a
Young Nobleman, than Arts
and Sciences; You have taken
the securest way by Encourag|ing
them to declare your Heart
is not set upon the Vanities of
the World, so much, as to slight
or neglect the more solid Trea|sures
of the Soul, Knowledge
and Learning.</P>
<P>Your Observations also in
your Travels, have given you
a greater Estimate than others
have acquired of the same Rank,
you have brought home more
than your Self again, Embellish|ments
of Languages, together
with a Survey of the Manners
<PB REF="4">
and Customs of the People, and
not like that raw empty-headed
Tribe, of whom a famous Antique
Author Writes thus,
<Q><L>&mdash;A Sordid Crew,</L>
<L>Who when they Travail to become rare Men,</L>
<L>Return Improv'd with a new foppish Suit,</L>
<L>Their Brains lie with their Taylor's, and get fancies</L>
<L>To play the Fool next day in; he's sole Heir,</L>
<L>To all the moral Vertues, that first greets</L>
<L>The light with a new Fashion, which becomes 'em</L>
<L>Like Monkies, cover'd with the Garbs of Men.</L></Q></P>
<P>Your Lordship has likewise
been at <HI>Rome,</HI> without daubing
your Self with her Rag of Super|stition,
or letting your Judgment
be impos'd upon by the Adul|terated
Sophistry of Priests and
Jesuits: In a Word, My Lord,
<PB REF="4">
you have begun your Race so
well, that it would appear di|rect
Malice or Stupidity in any
one to doubt proceedings an|swerable
through your Course of
Life to come.</P>
<P>I must beseech your Lordship
not to let a decent <HI>Encomium</HI> sound
harshly in your Ear, nor think
these Assertions flattery, and on|ly
natural to Dedications, which
are really the just effect of your
own Merit, and of my Obser|vation
of you, your obliging and
easie Temper, affable and unaffe|cted
Behavior, endearing all that
have the honor to know ye as
well as my self, the Continu|ance
of which Happiness, and
<PB REF="5">
the speedy crowning of your

the possession of a Noble and
Beautiful Partner, shall be the

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>NOT being able to Excuse my self from
the Importunity of some Persons of
Quality, and others of my best Friends, whose
obliging Requests, as well as generous Subscri|ptions,
have been the chiefest Reasons of my pub|lishing
the following Sheets; it would be an un|pardonable
Fault, and indeed a Presumption in
me not to beg the unbiass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d and Impartial <HI>Reader,</HI>
to favor them with his good Nature, and wink
at the many Errors and loose Writing in several
of them, some having been written many Years
ago, and upon low Subjects, especially the two <HI>Bur|lesque
Letters,</HI> which were written for a Friend
in haste, and upon a Subject given me. The
<HI>Ladies</HI> too I must beg to Pardon me for a loose
Copy or two, particularly, <HI>Phillidor's Tale</HI> of a
<HI>True Intrigue,</HI> Page 40. which was turn'd
into Verse from the Story which the Gentleman
<PB REF="6">
himself told me, and though the Freedom of it
may disoblige some of the Nicest of the Fair Sex,
who will be noted to understand more than they
should, yet 'tis my hope, that the more Iudicious
will only look upon it as it is, a piece of Mirth,
and a natural Description of a Comical Accident,
or else, which is much better, forbear looking
on it at all, and so be accounted extraordinary for
suppressing a Curiosity, which it was never known
a Woman was Capable of doing before. In Col|lections
of this Nature, both good and bad, wan|ton
and serious, generally mix, though not with
the <HI>Author</HI>'s liking, yet for the <HI>Stationer</HI>'s ad|vantage
of swelling the <HI>Book,</HI> in which, I hope,
there are some others that will make amends,
<HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Essay</HI> in Defence of <HI>Verse,</HI> The <HI>E|legy</HI>
on the Duke of <HI>Ormond;</HI> The <HI>Dream;</HI>
The <HI>Ode</HI> to the <HI>King,</HI> Page 180, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which
have had the good Fortune to be approv'd of and
commended by some of the best Iudges of <HI>Poe|try</HI>
these latter Ages have produc'd; and
will, I hope, find the same success with the In|genious
<HI>Reader;</HI> Though I must confess the
first is a Theme of that Value, that it were fit|ter
<PB REF="6">
to employ the Inimitable Pen of Mr. <HI>Dryden,</HI>
than any <HI>Poet</HI> of a meaner Class, the Sordid
Enemies of this Noble Art being so numerous,
and consequently the defence of it so much the
more difficult; This has given me occasion to
recount in the aforesaid <HI>Essay</HI> the nature of
the Criticks and Iudges of the former Golden
Age, and compare them with our present Iron
one, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q><L>The Sober Criticks were all Judges then,</L>
<L>And what they cavill'd at, could well maintain:</L>
<L>Instruction, and not Envy fill'd their Minds;</L>
<L>The Wits, and would be Wits, were different kinds:</L>
<L>Reason and Judgment founded their Disputes,</L>
<L>And <HI>Orpheus</HI> there was safe amongst the Brutes;</L>
<L>But here where Routs of Bachanals do throng;</L>
<L>Alas, what <HI>Orpheus</HI> can defend his Song! <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
most of our <HI>Town</HI> Wits Criticising upon <HI>Poetry,</HI>
not through any solid Understanding they have
of the matter, but to insinuate a Value of their
Eminent Parts into some unheeding Auditor, that
easily could, but thinks it loss of time to contra|dict
them.</P>
<P>Thus has dejected <HI>Poetry,</HI> in this Age, very
few or no real Friends; Those that judicially
<PB REF="7">
can correct Errors, being modestly unwilling to
expose them, and those that cannot, most im|pudently
too forward in pretending to it; like a
Country Clown at Cudgels with a Master of De|fence,
still striking without Fear or Wit, though
at every blow the Blood runs about his own Ears,
through his want of Skill, and ridiculous Rashness.</P>
<P>The <HI>Odes</HI> and <HI>Songs</HI> that I have here pub|lish'd,
have, I thank my Fortune, as well as those
formerly printed, generally pleas'd the <HI>Town,</HI>
and though some may appear a little rough
and unpolish'd in the Reading, the amends is
made when they are Sung, for I have still
taken care to put some Fancy and Thought
in them, and the Iudicious are sensible that 'tis
no easie matter, nor is it every one's Talent to con|fine
Sense and smooth Verse to Notes, the quality of
performing it well, being as particular as difficult.</P>
<P>It does not, thank my Stars, afflict me
much to know, that a certain very un|weildy
Author of this Age, has been this Ten
Years pecking at me about this matter, though
with as little Success as he had Reason to do so,
I having no Correspondency with him, nor to the
<PB REF="7">
best of my Memory, have any of our Brethern
ever given him any occasion to shew the scurri|lity
of his <HI>Satyr,</HI> in expressing himself in such
Tropes as <HI>these, Fellows of no Genius, yelping
Curs, Parasites, Knaves,</HI> &amp;c. nor does it con|cern
us at all to know whether <HI>Poetitto</HI> or <HI>Poet|dungus,</HI>
be the best name for a comical Author,
we have, I think, two ways to expound him, and
I suppose he is pleased to new baptize us, either,
for diminutive Wits, or Persons: if for the first
we must comfort our selves, and be instructed
as well as we can; but for my own part if he
lashes me for want of shape, that I confess <HI>from
him</HI> troubles me extremely.</P>
<P>I am not very uneasie neither to have if judg'd
whether my <HI>Grubstreet Songs,</HI> as he hints at
them, or his late <HI>Grubstreet Anniversary Ode</HI> be
the most notorious, or in his own Phrase, most
like the Stile of <HI>Tom Farthing:</HI> I know what
the Town says. And since it has sufficiently ex|pos'd
its own defects, I shall think my Injury re|veng'd
to the full, and therefore rest satisfied till
farther Provocation.</P>
<P>There is no Passion incident to Humanity
<PB REF="8">
of so low and base a degree as Malice, which I
could lash to the quick; nor would the Title of
<HI>Poet Laureate,</HI> and <HI>Historiographer Royal,</HI>
at all deter me from a just Resentment, if I
had not an awful Veneration for that noble Patron
of Wit and Poetry, whose Indulgence and excellent
Nature has been the occasion of bestowing so great
a Bounty where it is, and I shall rather believe
it the just reward of Merit and Loyalty, as some
would fain have it thought, than doubt in the least
the Iustice or Iudgment of a Noble Man, be|lov'd,
reverenc'd, and admir'd, by all that ever
had any true Pretences to Wit or Learning.</P>
<P>And now, I think, 'tis time to beg the <HI>Reader<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>s
Pardon for this Prolixity, which I could not avoid
having been so often affronted without any cause
given, and once more desire his Favor on the fol|lowing
Sheets, with a faithful Promise, that when
next I trouble the Press it shall be on a Subject
that shall less ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e his Patience, and give him much
more Diversion.</P>
