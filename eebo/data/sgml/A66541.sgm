<HEAD>THE PROEME.</HEAD>
<P>_I Am not ignorant, or insensible, from what <HI>Precipice,</HI> and into what <HI>Gulf</HI> I am falling; not like one in a Dream, who starts at the <HI>horrour</HI> of the <HI>Ob|ject,</HI> which his own <HI>imagination</HI> creates: But deeply affected with those serious and real impressions, which <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Experience</HI> (the two great <HI>Luminaries</HI> of <HI>Reason</HI>) have fixt upon me. Methinks I see the various, cloudy, and sad distorted Fancies of these <HI>Times,</HI> (that flutter up and down be|twixt the <HI>Twi-light</HI> of <HI>Ignorance,</HI> and <HI>Self-conceited|ness</HI>) bandy themselves against this <HI>Work</HI>; led on by <HI>Prejudice,</HI> which they muster up, and gather together, haply from the <HI>dross</HI> of those <HI>Fragments,</HI> or <HI>vapours</HI> of <HI>Story,</HI> that (like crude, and undigested Matter) have something tainted that precious <HI>Order,</HI> which <HI>Truth</HI> (the <HI>Commandress</HI> of the <HI>Soul</HI>) loves to appear, and be admired in. Making it a <HI>Crime</HI> even to name <HI>Kings</HI>; as if from that <HI>Name</HI> nothing could result, but such dreadful <HI>Apparitions</HI> as would blast and throw an odious <HI>tincture</HI> upon them, to the defacing and besmearing of <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Innocence</HI>; when these will sit <HI>Triumphing</HI> upon a <HI>Throne,</HI> in despight of
<PB REF="3">
<HI>Envy,</HI> pleading their own <HI>Cause</HI>; the <HI>Beams</HI> of that <HI>Majesty</HI> being too bright and splendid to be over|cast with the <HI>Mantle</HI> of <HI>Malice,</HI> though <HI>clouded</HI> and interwoven with all the false <HI>Pretences</HI> she can put on.</P>
<P>And yet I see no <HI>Reason</HI> why <HI>Princes</HI> (towring in the height of their own <HI>Power</HI>) should think themselves so far above ordinary <HI>Mortals,</HI> that their <HI>Actions</HI> are to be incomprehensible. This is but a weakness, con|tracted in the high place they look down from, which makes all things beneath them seem little, yea very little to them. And though <HI>Men</HI> at so great a distance from them, are not able to discern every particular <HI>Plume</HI> that carries them about, yet their often <HI>Circumgyrations,</HI> and <HI>Turnings,</HI> are <HI>Obvious,</HI> many times stooping after a mean and inconsiderable <HI>Quarry</HI>: By which they shew, that they are carried up by the <HI>Airy Body</HI> of <HI>Admiration,</HI> and that those gross <HI>Materials</HI> which tend to their <HI>Composition,</HI> are as subject to distempered <HI>Passions,</HI> as the meanest of the <HI>People.</HI></P>
<P>Yet as they live in a <HI>Sphere</HI> above others, if their <HI>Minds</HI> be suitable to that <HI>Height,</HI> if they aim more at <HI>Piety</HI> than <HI>Policy,</HI> if <HI>Religion</HI> be set up in their <HI>Hearts</HI> for her <HI>Humbleness,</HI> rather than her <HI>Ornaments,</HI> more for her <HI>Beauty,</HI> than <HI>Bravery,</HI> If <HI>Mercy</HI> and <HI>Iustice</HI> (instead of <HI>Wild Beasts</HI>) be Supporters of the Throne, and En|signs of <HI>Royalty</HI>; If <HI>Truth</HI> in her plain <HI>Attire</HI> (<HI>the love|liest Object of the Soul</HI>) be not turned out of the <HI>Pre|sence,</HI> and her painted <HI>Enemy</HI> sit perching under the Cloth of <HI>Estate</HI>; If <HI>Vertue</HI> and <HI>Goodness</HI> be venera|ted from an internal <HI>Principle</HI> in them, rather than the specious outside of them: Who will not admire, and reverence such <HI>Majesty</HI>? But when they shall so much debase that sublime and supereminent <HI>Region</HI> they are placed in, and come down below that <HI>Dig|nity,</HI> to drive a Trade of petty things, thinking it a great <HI>Conquest</HI> to deceive; protesting to do what
<PB REF="3">
they never intend, and intending what they rather should protest against: To what low <HI>Condition</HI> do they bring themselves?</P>
<P>We see all the <HI>Motions</HI> of <HI>Superior Bodies,</HI> in what excellent <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Perfection</HI> they move; and if some <HI>Exhalation</HI> starts up among them, from gross and putrid <HI>Matter,</HI> whose <HI>Course</HI> is not yet known, what horrid trepidations bring they with them? and what <HI>Prodigious Calamities</HI> are they the <HI>fore-run|ners</HI> of? Yet they hold not that <HI>Station</HI> long, but blaze a little there, and then extinguish; and all that can be said of them, is, That we know not for what mischievous intent these <HI>Meteors</HI> did appear: Whereas the other <HI>Celestial Bodies</HI> beget no <HI>wonder,</HI> are no <HI>Prodigies,</HI> but keep a constant <HI>Course</HI> in their own <HI>Spheres,</HI> and are not contaminated with <HI>things</HI> below them, yet they retain a <HI>Powerful Influence</HI> o|ver them. So <HI>Princes</HI> should always shine in <HI>Glory,</HI> and a <HI>Noble Soul,</HI> that loaths to soyl it self in sor|did things, is the true <HI>splendor</HI> of it. But when they grovel here for trash and trumpery, and trade away that gallant stock of <HI>Love</HI> housed in their <HI>Peoples Hearts,</HI> for some false <HI>Coin,</HI> minted by <HI>Passion,</HI> mu|table <HI>Affection,</HI> or mis-led <HI>Reason,</HI> they do degrade themselves. And then the only difference betwixt a <HI>King,</HI> and a mean <HI>Man,</HI> is, That the one, by his Trade, cosens a few; the other a great many, but himself most.</P>
<P>Thus we can look up to things above us, easily discerning the Cracks and Flaws in Vessels of the pu|rest <HI>Metal,</HI> by that <HI>lustre</HI> that comes from them; but if we cast an impartial <HI>Eye</HI> into our own <HI>Bosoms,</HI> we may doubtless discover in our selves so much of <HI>Hu|man Frailty,</HI> even of a grosser <HI>Nature,</HI> that may make <HI>Pity</HI> the <HI>Mistriss</HI> of our <HI>Passion,</HI> rather than <HI>Pride,</HI> and mourn for our <HI>own,</HI> rather than glory in the <HI>Miscar|riages</HI> of <HI>Others. Shrouds</HI> are the fittest <HI>Ornaments</HI> for
<PB REF="4">
<HI>dead Bodies</HI>; and who will rip up <HI>wounds</HI> that <HI>Time</HI> hath closed? A little <HI>Urn</HI> will hold a great <HI>Mans Ashes</HI>; and why should we bedribble with our <HI>Pens,</HI> the <HI>Dust</HI> that rests there? there is now no fear that it will rise, and fly upon our faces.</P>
<P><HI>Histories</HI> are like <HI>Anatomies,</HI> especially when they re|flect on <HI>Persons</HI>: He must be a <HI>skilful Artist,</HI> that can dis|sect a <HI>Body</HI> well. If <HI>Ignorance</HI> or <HI>Malice</HI> attempts to hack, hew, or bespatter it, 'twill be most <HI>inhuman</HI> and <HI>barba|rous</HI>; it must be done by a gentle hand, with <HI>Authority</HI> and <HI>Knowledg,</HI> lest instead of discovering the <HI>Similar Parts,</HI> they mangle and deface them, and so dissect and open only their own <HI>follies</HI>; When the true end of this dissection, is, to shew the <HI>ways</HI> and <HI>passages</HI> of the <HI>Body,</HI> where <HI>Obstructions</HI> have been, where <HI>Diseases</HI> have bred, and by this <HI>Pattern</HI> learn to remove the accretion of bad <HI>Humors,</HI> and apply fitting <HI>Remedies</HI> for prevention of such <HI>Evils</HI>: So <HI>History</HI> must not cauterise, and slash with <HI>Ma|lice,</HI> those <HI>Noble Parts,</HI> the true end of whose discovery is to better <HI>Mankind.</HI> For <HI>Examples</HI> of baseness, and unwor|thiness, if truly and genuinely related, may deter and hinder the violent <HI>Career</HI> of such as mind no other <HI>happi|ness</HI> than what this <HI>vapour</HI> of <HI>vain-glory</HI> can contribute; and esteem a good <HI>Name</HI> more among <HI>men,</HI> than accep|tance with <HI>God.</HI> But yet in these <HI>Relations,</HI> some grains of <HI>Human infirmity</HI> must in reason be allowed to <HI>Great|ness,</HI> because they have the means to more <HI>Temptations.</HI> And though there are very many guilty, and many <HI>Men</HI> may justly suffer by the <HI>Law,</HI> yet there are but few al|lowed to be dissected. Therefore he that is too rash in the <HI>Censure</HI> of others, snatching <HI>Reports</HI> from the lips of <HI>Fame,</HI> and venting them for <HI>Truths</HI> (without some pro|bability or knowledg to enlighten and direct) digs in the <HI>Bowels</HI> of another <HI>Man,</HI> and wounds himself.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Metaphor</HI> still holds; for as the <HI>dissimilar</HI> parts of the body, head, hands, feet, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are apparently known; and the <HI>Similar</HI> parts, as veins, sinews, nerves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<PB REF="4">
are easily discovered; so the <HI>motions</HI> and <HI>operations</HI> of the more secret and hidden parts are controverted, and hard to find out, as the <HI>Circulation</HI> of the Blood, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Yet we find the effects of it tend to life and preservation, the <HI>end</HI>; though there be some dispute in the <HI>motion</HI> or means to it. So in this <HI>Work</HI>; the chief part of what is written, is either apparently <HI>known,</HI> or easily <HI>discovered,</HI> and those things that never saw the <HI>Light</HI> yet, may be collected, and inferred, finding their <HI>Operations</HI> tend to one and the same end: For I expect all men will not be of my <HI>mind,</HI> and look to be <HI>Anatomized</HI> my self by the <HI>Hand</HI> of <HI>Opinion</HI> and blinded <HI>Passion,</HI> that strike at whatsoever comes cross to them. Yet this I will say boldly, I have made <HI>Truth</HI> my <HI>aim,</HI> and though I fly high, and may rove, I am sure not to <HI>light</HI> very far from the <HI>Mark.</HI></P>
<P>For this <HI>Piece</HI> is not culled out of several <HI>Authors,</HI> of <HI>intricate Opinions,</HI> and different <HI>Iudgments,</HI> as a confused, and ruffled <HI>Skein,</HI> where, with difficulty, an useful <HI>Thread</HI> may be pickt out, which <HI>Livie</HI> complains of, and won|ders at in the <HI>Authors</HI> that <HI>wrote</HI> before him. But these like <HI>Simples</HI> were gathered as they sprung up in the <HI>Gar|den</HI> of the <HI>Times</HI> (where <HI>Weeds</HI> and <HI>Flowers</HI> grow toge|ther) with intention to compose something for the <HI>Pub|lick health</HI>; for above thirty years before the Ingredients were mingled, in that long <HI>Series</HI> of <HI>Time,</HI> weighing eve|ry <HI>Grain</HI> and <HI>Scruple,</HI> that there might be a due proporti|on, and quantity as well as quality of them for the <HI>Com|position</HI> of it; and this not only acted by a natural <HI>Pro|pensity,</HI> but I may say the hand of <HI>Providence</HI> brought ma|ny things to my knowledg, that were not in my hopes or thoughts to procure. And I confess there are some things in it may seem bitter, and sharp to some, and though they be so, the <HI>Body</HI> many times requires such <HI>Medicines,</HI> to dispel and check the peccant <HI>humours,</HI> and I doubt not but it will do the more good to those that are distempered: But <HI>sound</HI> and <HI>gallant Minds</HI> have no need, and are above the <HI>operations</HI> of it. As <HI>Titus Vespasian</HI> said,
<PB REF="5">
when one spake ill of him, <HI>Ego cum nihil faciam dignum propter quod contumeli&acirc; afficiar, mendacia nihil curo</HI>; He was above false Reports, and if they were true, he had more reason to be angry with himself, than the <HI>Relator.</HI> The good Emperor <HI>Theodosius</HI> commanded no man should be punished that spake against him; for what was spo|ken <HI>lightly</HI> was to be laught at, what <HI>spightfully,</HI> to be par|doned, what <HI>angerly,</HI> to be pittied; and if <HI>truly,</HI> he would thank him for it. Nor did I ever read, that <HI>Tacitus</HI> was blamed for personating <HI>Tiberius</HI> Dissimulation, <HI>Nero</HI>'s Cruelty, <HI>Seianus</HI> Pride, <HI>Livia</HI>'s and <HI>Messalina</HI>'s Adulteries, nay, <HI>Domitians</HI> Tyranny and Baseness, though he was his <HI>Creature</HI> advanced by him. But they that intend <HI>Truth,</HI> must take this <HI>Counsel</HI> of his, <HI>Sed incorruptam fidem professis, nec amore quisquam, &amp; sine odio dicendus est</HI>; they must write without the passions of <HI>Love</HI> or <HI>Hate.</HI> And I am sure I have as little cause to be partial as <HI>He,</HI> though I have more to inlarge my self in <HI>Apology,</HI> having more Adversaries to incounter with; He living in (as he saith) <HI>Rara temporum felicitate,</HI> where <HI>Men</HI> might think what they pleased, and speak what they thought; Where|as these <HI>Times</HI> are as full of perplexed and disasterous <HI>Di|visions,</HI> as the calamities of a <HI>Civil War</HI> (when the poyson of <HI>Malice</HI> lies raging and foaming in mens breasts, like the troubled <HI>Sea</HI> after a <HI>Tempest</HI>) can possibly produce. And this <HI>Dis-union</HI> springs from that stock of <HI>Pride</HI> in us, when we put a greater valuation upon our <HI>Opinions,</HI> stampt, and made current by <HI>Custom,</HI> than upon <HI>Reason,</HI> that <HI>Regent</HI> of the <HI>Understanding,</HI> that should bring all things in obedience to it.</P>
<P>Nor can I discover all the <HI>Contrivances</HI> hatcht, and brooded in the secret corners of <HI>Princes Councils.</HI> All things are not revealed at a time. This <HI>Ground-work</HI> may serve for others to build on, and 'tis easier to add to a <HI>Pattern</HI> than to make <HI>one.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Iews,</HI> to whom the <HI>Oracles</HI> of <HI>Truth</HI> were com|mitted, calculated their <HI>Times</HI> and <HI>Seasons</HI> by <HI>Lunary mo|tions,</HI>
<PB REF="5">
the <HI>Solar</HI> were found out long after by <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> and now we have new apprehensions inserted by <HI>Coper|nicus,</HI> that may be as useful, tending to one time and end, though various ways. So by degrees, there may be greater <HI>Discoveries</HI> made, than is yet here related. And what is <HI>doubtful,</HI> give me leave with <HI>Tacitus</HI> only to touch at, who (speaking of <HI>Domitians</HI> attempting to get the <HI>Power</HI> of the <HI>German Army</HI> under his command) saith, <HI>Qua cogitatione Bellum adversus Patrem cogitaverit, an opes, viresque adversus fratrem in incerto fuit.</HI> Whether he inten|ded <HI>War</HI> against his Father by it, or to strengthen himself against his Brother, when time served, is not certainly known; for who can dive into the <HI>Abyss</HI> of Princes in|tentions? And in another place speaking of <HI>Domitian</HI>'s jugling with <HI>Agricola, Sive verum istud, sive ex ingenio Prin|cipis fictum ac compositum est.</HI> Whether this were true, or surmised, probably, as correspondent to the <HI>Prince</HI>'s dis|position, I cannot affirm. Yet where he finds out his extravagancies (of Knowledg) he asserts them punctu|ally. So some things in <HI>Princes</HI> actions may be left to conjecture, if there be any ingenuity in the <HI>Declaration</HI> of them. And I hope some will come after me, that will imbellish, and perfect the way with a more cunning and exquisite hand, though I must confess I have done my best, dressing this <HI>Story</HI> with the best <HI>Ornaments</HI> I could, to intice, and allure the <HI>Reader,</HI> leaving out many long and tedious <HI>Discourses,</HI> that often damp the <HI>Spirits,</HI> and make them <HI>Loiterers.</HI> And it were to be wished, that <HI>Philosophy</HI> had some intermixtures of <HI>History</HI>; and that <HI>Divinity</HI> (the <HI>Mistris</HI> of <HI>Arts</HI>) were temptingly adorned, that she might intice her <HI>Lovers</HI> the more to observe her. The <HI>Iesuits</HI> dress their <HI>Morality</HI> and <HI>History</HI> with all the <HI>Eloquence</HI> they can, and cunningly mix and intermingle with it, the fine <HI>Baits</HI> of <HI>Popish Theology,</HI> for people to nibble on, hoping to gain them by such tempting <HI>Allure|ments.</HI> And I am not of <HI>Marcus Aurelius</HI>'s mind, that thankt <HI>Rusticus,</HI> that by his example, he had given over
<PB REF="6">
the study of <HI>Elegant,</HI> and fine <HI>Language</HI>; unless he re|flected upon such crabbed pieces, as are interlarded with <HI>huge lushious</HI> words, that give no good rellish to the <HI>sense,</HI> or such high affected <HI>strains</HI> (wherein words are crow|ded) that serve rather to amuse than inform the <HI>Under|standing.</HI> But <HI>Elegancies</HI> in expression (though I am not able to reach them my self) I admire in others, especi|ally if they run in a smooth Chanel, and keep that medi|ocrity that they overflow not the bank.</P>
<P>But while I am pleading for <HI>Mediocrity,</HI> I find my self in a <HI>Labyrinth</HI> (betwixt too little <HI>Pamphlets,</HI> our <HI>Kings Court,</HI> and his <HI>Kitchen</HI>) and I know not by what <HI>Clue</HI> to avoid it. They are like two extremes, <HI>Scylla,</HI> and <HI>Cha|rybdis,</HI> therefore to pass by, and not be indangered by them, I will shape my <HI>Course</HI> in the <HI>middle,</HI> betwixt both, and <HI>Truth</HI> shall be my <HI>Gale</HI>: For I protest, without pa|ssion, I lean to no <HI>Faction</HI> or side; but set down plainly what my <HI>Conscience</HI> and <HI>Knowledg dictates</HI> to me. Nor do I intend to asperse <HI>Noble Families</HI>; Where is there one (as that famous <HI>Orator,</HI> the Lord <HI>Verulam,</HI> said) that like a fair <HI>Pomegronate</HI> hath not some <HI>corrupted Cornel</HI>? And may not that be pickt out from the rest, but it must taint them all? And how can <HI>Truth</HI> be known, but by the good <HI>savour</HI> it leaves behind? <HI>For a good Name is like a pre|cious Oyntment.</HI> Never any thing of <HI>History</HI> should be left to <HI>Posterity,</HI> if men may not be spoken of when they are dead. And if their <HI>Actions</HI> be genuinely related, there will be an intermixture of Good and Bad, profes|sedly allowed, according to the good or ill <HI>Comportment</HI> of the person presented (though, as I said, tenderly to be dealt with) for <HI>Man</HI> is of no <HI>Angelical nature.</HI> But it is easie to daub over the foulest <HI>Deformities,</HI> and make them appear <HI>Beautiful</HI>: For as <HI>Ulpian</HI> said of the <HI>Laws</HI> of his time, so I say of <HI>Historical Relations, Nulla veritas ita diserte ulla de re cavere potest, ut malitios a calliditas locum fraudi non inveniat.</HI> But this stirring of the <HI>Waters,</HI> is only to make the <HI>Truth</HI> less perspicuous, when time shall settle
<PB REF="6">
them, all things will appear clearly. <HI>Records,</HI> and pub|lick <HI>Actions,</HI> within <HI>Memory,</HI> cannot sink, though the <HI>Dregs</HI> and <HI>muddy water</HI> (thrown in to trouble them) may. But I will steer steady, and avoid them both, hoping to arrive at some happy <HI>Port,</HI> if I can pass the <HI>Shallows</HI> of <HI>Ignorance,</HI> or <HI>Rocks</HI> of <HI>Prejudice,</HI> that lie in the <HI>Way.</HI></P>

<P>On the other side, the late <HI>Conspiracy</HI> of <HI>Cobham</HI> and <HI>Grey,</HI> had so chilled the Kings blood, that he begins to take notice of the swarms of <HI>Priests</HI> that flockt into the Kingdom: For though the <HI>Conspirators</HI> were of several <HI>Religions,</HI> yet in their correspondence with Foreign <HI>Princes, Religion</HI> was the pretence. For in every alteration of Kingdoms, few are so modest but they will throw in the Hook of their vain <HI>Hopes,</HI> thinking to get something in the troubled <HI>Stream.</HI> The <HI>Iesuits</HI> were not slack (coming with the <HI>Seal of the Fisher</HI>) in spreading their <HI>Nets</HI>; but a <HI>Proclama|tion</HI> broke through them. The King being contented to let them alone, till they came too near him, willing to comply ra|ther than exasperate; the safety of his own person, made him look to the safety of <HI>Religion</HI>; and to secure both, He found this the best <HI>Remedy,</HI> Declaring, to all the <HI>World,</HI> the cause of this <HI>Restriction.</HI></P>

Contrivances, which afterwards they put in practice.</P>
<P>On the contrary, another <HI>Proclamation</HI> came out for <HI>Vnifor|mity</HI> in <HI>Religion</HI> according to the Law established, to reduce those to Conformity that had not received satisfaction at the last Conference.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Proclama|tion for Uni|formity.</NOTE> The <HI>Bishops</HI> thought themselves unsecure, while so many <HI>opposites</HI> (unblameable in their <HI>conversations</HI>) by their Pens and Preaching gained upon the people, striking at the ve|ry <HI>Root</HI> of <HI>Hierarchy,</HI> that it was a hard <HI>Question,</HI> whether the <HI>Iesuits,</HI> whose <HI>Principles</HI> would advance their <HI>Greatness,</HI> or these that would pluck it down, were most odious to them.

<P>The <HI>Bishops</HI> could not be so wary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Sermon a|gainst Cere|monies.</NOTE> but some <HI>Courtier</HI> or other would commend a <HI>Preacher</HI> to the King, if they knew any of ex|cellent <HI>parts,</HI> so that some preached before him that were averse to the <HI>Bishops</HI> ways. Among the rest one Mr. <HI>Burges,</HI> an excellent Preacher, and a pious man, moderately touching upon the <HI>Cere|monies,</HI> said,
<Q>They were like the <HI>Roman Senators</HI> Glasses, which were not worth a mans life or livelihood: For (saith he) this <HI>Senator</HI> invited <HI>Augustus Caesar</HI> to a Dinner, and as he was coming to the Feast, he heard a horrid <HI>Out-cry,</HI> and saw some company drawing a man after them, that made that noise: the Emperor demanded the cause of that violence; it was answered, their Master had condemned this man to the <HI>Fish|ponds</HI> for breaking a <HI>Glass</HI> which he set a high value and esteem upon, <HI>Caesar</HI> commanded a stay of the <HI>Execution,</HI> and when he came to the House, he asked the <HI>Senator, whether he had Glasses worth a mans life</HI>? Who answered (being a great <HI>lover</HI> of such things) that he had <HI>Glasses</HI> he valued at the price of a <HI>Province.</HI> Let me see them (saith <HI>Augustus</HI>) and he brought him up to a <HI>room</HI> well furnished. The <HI>Emperor</HI> saw them beautiful to the eye, but knew withal they might be the cause of much
<PB N="12" REF="18">
<HI>mischief,</HI> therefore he broke them all, with this expression, <HI>Better all these perish than one man.</HI></Q> I will leave it (saith he) to your <HI>Majesty</HI> to apply. But the <HI>Bishops,</HI> got this and some other things against him, by the end, and silenced him for venting any more such <HI>comparisons.</HI> So that for many years after he practised Physick, and grew an excellent Physician. Put upon second considerations he was admitted again to Preach, retaining both his Piety and Integrity (though he writ a book for the mode|rate use of the <HI>Ceremonies</HI>) ending his days in a good <HI>old age,</HI> at <HI>Sutton Cofeld</HI> in <HI>Warwick-shire,</HI> after a journey into the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> as shall be exprest in its time.</P>
<P>The fifth of <HI>August</HI> this year had a new title given to it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fifth of <HI>August</HI> made Holyday.</NOTE> The Kings <HI>Deliveries</HI> in the <HI>North</HI> must resound here. Whether the <HI>Gowries</HI> attempted upon the Kings person, or the King on theirs, is variously reported. It may be, he retained something of his <HI>Predecessor,</HI> and great <HI>Parent, Henry</HI> the <HI>seventh,</HI> that made <HI>Religi|on</HI> give way to <HI>Policy,</HI> oftentimes cursing and thundring out the <HI>Churches</HI> fulminations against his own <HI>Ministers,</HI> that they might be received with the more intimate familiarity with his Foreign <HI>Enemies,</HI> for the better discovery of their <HI>designs.</HI> I will not say the <HI>celebration</HI> of this <HI>Holy-day</HI> had so much Prophaneness, for <HI>Fame</HI> may be a slanderer. But where there is a strength of <HI>Policy,</HI> there is often a power of <HI>worldly</HI> wisdom that manages, and sways it. The King forgot not the services there done him, or the secret contrivances acted for him; for <HI>Erskin</HI> and <HI>Ramsey,</HI> two of his then deliverers, were not long after rewarded with <HI>wealth</HI> and <HI>honour,</HI> the one made Earl of <HI>Kellie,</HI> the other Earl of <HI>Holderness,</HI>; the first, prime Gentleman of the <HI>Bed-Chamber</HI> to the King; and second got to his Bedfellow one of the prime <HI>Beauties</HI> of the Kingdom, daughter to <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Sussex</HI>; and both of them had their <HI>Masters</HI> purse at command, yet in our time, the one died poor with many children, the other poor and childless.</P>
<P>The Kings first going abroad was privately to visit some of his <HI>houses</HI>; for <HI>naturally</HI> he did not <HI>love</HI> to be looked on, and those <HI>formalities</HI> of State, which set a <HI>lustre</HI> upon <HI>Princes</HI> in the peoples eyes, were but so many burthens to him: for his private <HI>recreations</HI> at home, and his <HI>hunting</HI> exercises abroad, both with the least disturbance were his delights. While he remained in the Tower, he took pleasure in baiting <HI>Lions,</HI> but when he came abroad, he was so troubled with <HI>swarms,</HI> that he feared to be baited by the <HI>people.</HI> And the <HI>Parliament</HI> now drawing on, which was summoned to be the nineteenth of <HI>March,</HI> The King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King and Queen ride through the City.</NOTE> with the Queen and Prince, four days before, rode from the Tower to <HI>Whitehall</HI>; the City and Suburbs being one great <HI>Pageant,</HI> wherein he must give his ears leave to suck in their gilded <HI>Oratory,</HI> though never so <HI>nauseous</HI> to the <HI>stomach.</HI> He was
<PB N="13" REF="18">
not like his <HI>Predecessor,</HI> the late <HI>Queen</HI> of famous <HI>memory,</HI> that with a well-pleased affection met her peoples Acclamations, thinking most highly of her self, when she was born up on the <HI>wings</HI> of their <HI>humble supplications.</HI> He endured this <HI>days</HI> brunt with <HI>patience,</HI> being assured he should never have such another, and his <HI>triumphal</HI> riding to the <HI>Parliament</HI> that followed: But afterwards in his <HI>publick</HI> appearances (especially in his <HI>sports</HI>) the accesses of the people made him so impatient, that he often dispersed them with <HI>frowns,</HI> that we may not say with <HI>curses.</HI> So various are the <HI>natures</HI> of <HI>Princes,</HI> and their <HI>actions</HI> so remarkable, that he may pass for a good man, that will not pass for a good Prince.</P>
<P>The Speech he made to the <HI>Parliament,</HI> both <HI>Houses</HI> being met, and the <HI>first,</HI> cannot be waved, though it be somewhat <HI>long,</HI> and printed in his <HI>own Works</HI>; By the <HI>crisis</HI> and constitution of it, the temper of his <HI>mind</HI> may be discovered; For if ever he spake really to his <HI>Parliament</HI> it was then; And I shall not comment upon it: For I know <HI>Princes</HI> are made of those frail <HI>Elements</HI> that other men are, but this much I will say; He had strong abilities in some things, that did dignifie the <HI>doer</HI> of them, and in other things such <HI>weaknesses,</HI> as would have much advanced his <HI>Wisdom</HI> to have left undone. But if <HI>worldly Greatness,</HI> and <HI>Glory,</HI> may well make <HI>Princes</HI> more loth to leave them, than they that have less, we must give them some allowance of fear to lose them. The Speech was to this effect.</P>
<Q><P>It did no sooner please God to lighten his hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Kings Speech to the Parliament.</NOTE> and relent the violence of his devouring <HI>Angel</HI> against the poor people of this City, but as soon I did resolve to call this <HI>Parliament,</HI> and that for three chief and principal <HI>Reasons.</HI> The first whereof is (and which of it self, although there were no <HI>more,</HI> is not only a sufficient, but a most full and necessary Ground and Reason for convening of this <HI>Assembly</HI>) the first <HI>Reason,</HI> I say, is, That you who are here present assembled to represent the Body of this whole Kingdom, and of all sorts of people within the same, may with your own ears hear, and that I out of my own mouth may deliver unto you the assurance of my due thank|fulness for your so joyful and general applause, to the de|claring and receiving of me in this <HI>Seat</HI> (which God by my <HI>Birth-right,</HI> and lineal Descent had in the fulness of time pro|vided for me) and that immediately after it pleased God to call your late <HI>Soveraign</HI> of famous <HI>memory,</HI> full of <HI>days,</HI> but fuller of immortal <HI>Trophies</HI> of <HI>Honour,</HI> out of this transitory life. Not that I am able to express by Words, or utter by Elo|quence, the vive Image of my own inward thankfulness, but only that out of my own <HI>mouth,</HI> you may rest assured to ex|pect that measure of thankfulness at my hands, which is ac|cording to the infiniteness of your <HI>deserts,</HI> and to my incli|nation,
<PB N="14" REF="19">
and ability, for requital of the same. <HI>Shall I ever?</HI> nay, can I ever be able, or rather so unable in <HI>memory,</HI> as to forget your unexpected readiness and alacrity, your ever memorable <HI>resolution,</HI> and your most wonderful conjunction, and harmo|ny of your hearts, in declaring and imbracing me as your un|doubted, and lawful King and Governour? Or shall it ever be blotted out of my <HI>mind,</HI> how at my first entry into this Kingdom, the people of all sorts rid and ran, nay, rather, flew to meet me? Their eyes flaming nothing but sparkles of <HI>af|fection,,</HI> their mouths and tongues uttering nothing but <HI>sounds</HI> of <HI>joy</HI>; their hands, feet, and all the rest of their members, in their <HI>gestures,</HI> discovering a <HI>passionate</HI> longing, and earnestness to meet, and imbrace their new <HI>Soveraign. Quid ergo retribu|am?</HI> Shall I allow in my self that which I could never bear with in another? No, I must plainly and freely confess here, in all your audiences, that I did ever <HI>naturally</HI> so far mislike a tongue too smooth, and diligent in paying their <HI>Creditors,</HI> with <HI>lip-payment,</HI> and verbal thanks, as I ever suspected that sort of people, meant not to pay their Debtors in more <HI>sub|stantial</HI> sort of <HI>coin.</HI> And therefore for expressing of my thank|fulness, I must resort unto the other two <HI>Reasons</HI> of my conve|ning of this <HI>Parliament,</HI> by them in <HI>action</HI> to utter my thank|fulness: Both the said <HI>reasons</HI> having but one ground, which is the deeds, whereby all the days of my life I am by Gods grace to express my said thankfulness unto you, but divided in this, That in the first of these two, mine <HI>actions</HI> of thanks are so inseparably conjoyned with my person, as they are in a manner become individually annexed to the same. In the o|ther <HI>reason,</HI> mine <HI>actions</HI> are such, as I may either do them, or leave them undone, although by Gods grace I hope never to be weary of the doing them.</P><P>As to the first, it is the <HI>Blessings</HI> which God hath in my <HI>Person</HI> bestowed upon you all, wherein I protest, I do more glory at the same for your <HI>weal,</HI> than for any particular respect of my own reputation, or advancement therein.</P><P><HI>The first</HI> then of these <HI>Blessings,</HI> which God hath joyntly <MILESTONE N="1"> with my person sent unto you, is <HI>Outward Peace</HI>; that is, Peace abroad with all Foreign <HI>Neighbours</HI>: For I thank God, I may justly say, that never since I was a King, I either received wrong of any other <HI>Christian Prince or State,</HI> or did wrong to any: I have ever, I praise God, yet kept <HI>Peace</HI> and Amity with all, which hath been so far tyed to my person, as at my coming here you are witnesses, I found the <HI>State</HI> imbarked in a great and tedious <HI>War,</HI> and only by mine arrival here, and by the <HI>Peace</HI> in my <HI>person,</HI> is now <HI>Amity</HI> kept, where <HI>War</HI> was before, which is no small blessing to a <HI>Christian</HI> Common-wealth: For by <HI>peace</HI> abroad with their <HI>neighbours</HI> the Towns flourish, the
<PB N="15" REF="19">
Merchants become rich, the Trade doth increase, and the People of all sorts in the Land enjoy free Liberty to exercise themselves in their several <HI>vocations,</HI> without peril or distur|bance. Not that I think this <HI>Outward peace</HI> so unseparably tied to my <HI>Person,</HI> as I dare assuredly promise to my self, and to you, the certain continuance thereof; But thus far I can very well assure you, and in the Word of a King promise unto you, that I shall never give the first occasion of the breach thereof, neither shall I ever be moved for any particular, or private <HI>passion</HI> of <HI>mind,</HI> to interrupt your <HI>publick peace,</HI> except I be forced thereunto, either for reparation of the <HI>honour</HI> of the Kingdom, or else by <HI>necessity</HI> for the weal and preservation of the same: In which case, a secure and honourable <HI>War</HI> must be preferred before an unsecure and dishonourable <HI>peace.</HI> Yet do I hope, by my experience of the by past blessings of <HI>peace,</HI> which God hath so long ever since my birth bestowed upon me, that he will not be weary to continue the same, nor repent him of his <HI>grace</HI> towards me; transferring that <HI>sen|tence</HI> of King <HI>Davids</HI> upon his by past Victories of <HI>War,</HI> to mine of <HI>peace</HI>; That that God who preserved me from the devou|ring jaws of the Bear, and of the Lion, and delivered them into my hand, shall now also grant me Victory over that un|circumcised <HI>Philistine.</HI></P><P>But although outward <HI>peace</HI> be a great <HI>blessing,</HI><MILESTONE N="2"> yet it is as far inferiour to <HI>peace</HI> within, as Civil Wars are more cruel and unnatural than Wars abroad. And therefore the second great <HI>blessing</HI> that God hath with my Person sent unto you, is Peace within, and that in a double form: First, by my de|descent lineally out of the loyns of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, is re-uni|ted and confirmed in me the <HI>Vnion</HI> of the two <HI>Princely Roses</HI> of the two Houses of <HI>Lancaster</HI> and <HI>York,</HI> whereof that King of happy <HI>memory</HI> was the first <HI>Vniter,</HI> as he was also the first ground-layer of the other <HI>peace</HI> (The lamentable and misera|ble events, by the civil and bloody dissension betwixt these two <HI>Houses,</HI> was so great, and so late, as it need not be renew|ed unto your <HI>memories</HI>) which as it was first setled and uni|ted in <HI>Him,</HI> so it is now re-united and confirmed in <HI>Me</HI>; be|ing justly and lineally descended, not only of that happy conjunction, but of both the Branches thereof in any Times before. But the Union of these two <HI>Princely Houses</HI> is nothing comparable to the Union of the two ancient and famous Kingdoms, which is the other Inward peace annexed to my Person.</P><P>And here I must crave your <HI>patience</HI> for a little space, to give me leave to discourse more particularly of the Benefits that do arise of that <HI>Vnion</HI> which is made in my blood, being a matter that belongeth most properly to me to speak of, as
<PB N="16" REF="20">
the <HI>Head,</HI> wherein that great <HI>Body</HI> is united. And first, if we were to look no higher than to <HI>Natural</HI> and <HI>Physical Reasons,</HI> we may easily be perswaded of the great Benefits that by this <HI>V|nion</HI> do redound to the whole Island: for if twenty thousand men be a strong <HI>Army,</HI> is not the double thereof, forty thou|sand, a stronger <HI>Army</HI>? If a Baron enricheth himself with double as many Lands as he had before, is he not double the greater? Nature teacheth <HI>Vs,</HI> that <HI>Mountains</HI> are made of <HI>Motes</HI>; and that at first, Kingdoms being divided, and every particular Town, or little Country (as Tyrants or Usurpers could obtain the possession of a Signory apart) many of these little Kingdoms are now in process of Time, by the <HI>Ordi|nance of God,</HI> joyned into great <HI>Monarchies,</HI> whereby they are become powerful within themselves, to defend themselves from all Outward invasions, and their <HI>Head</HI> and <HI>Governour</HI> thereby enabled to redeem them from Foreign Assaults, and punish private transgressions within. Do we not yet remember that this Kingdom was divided into seven little Kingdoms, besides <HI>Wales</HI>? And is it not now the stronger by their <HI>Vni|on?</HI> And hath not the <HI>Vnion</HI> of <HI>Wales</HI> to <HI>England</HI> added a greater strength thereto! Which though it was a great Prin|cipality, was nothing comparable, in greatness and power, to the antient and famous Kingdom of <HI>Scotland.</HI> But what shall we stick upon any Natural appearance, when it is manifest that <HI>God</HI> by his <HI>Almighty Providence</HI> hath pre-ordained it so to be? Hath not God first united these two Kingdoms, both in Language, and Religion, and similitude of Manners? Yea, hath he not made <HI>Vs</HI> all in one Island, compassed with one Sea, and of it self by Nature so indivisible, as almost those that were borderers themselves on the late <HI>Borders,</HI> cannot distinguish, nor know, or discern their own <HI>Limits</HI>? These two Countries being separated neither by Sea, nor great Ri|ver, Mountain, nor other strength of <HI>Nature,</HI> but only by little small Brooks, or demolished little Walls, so as rather they were divided in apprehension, than in effect; and now in the end and fulness of time united, the right and title of both in my <HI>Person,</HI> alike lineally descended of both the <HI>Crowns,</HI> where|by it is now become a <HI>little World</HI> within it self, being in|trenched and fortified round about with a <HI>natural,</HI> and yet admirable strong Pond or Ditch, whereby all the former fears of this Nation are quite cut off: The other part of the Island being ever before now, not only the Place of Landing to all Strangers that were to make Invasion here, but likewise mo|ved by the Enemies of this <HI>State,</HI> by untimely Incursions to make inforced diversion from their <HI>Conquests,</HI> for defending themselves at home, and keeping sure their Back-door, as then it was called, which was the greatest hindrance and Let my
<PB N="17" REF="20">
Predecessors of this <HI>Nation</HI> ever had, in disturbing them from their many famous and glorious Conquests abroad: <HI>What God hath conjoyned then, let no man separate.</HI> I am the <HI>Husband,</HI> and all the whole Island is my lawful <HI>Wife</HI>; I am the <HI>Head,</HI> and it is my <HI>Body</HI>; I am the <HI>Shepherd,</HI> and it is my <HI>Flock</HI>: I hope therefore no man will be so unreasonable as to think that I, that am a <HI>Christian King</HI> under the Gospel, should be a <HI>Polygamist,</HI> and <HI>Husband</HI> to two <HI>Wives</HI>; that I be|ing the <HI>Head,</HI> should have a divided and monstrous <HI>Body</HI>; or that being the <HI>Shepherd</HI> of so fair a <HI>Flock</HI> (whose <HI>Fold</HI> hath no wall to sence it, but the four <HI>Seas</HI>) should have my <HI>Flock</HI> parted in two. But as I am assured, that no honest <HI>Subject,</HI> of whatsoever degree, within my whole <HI>Dominions,</HI> is less glad of this joyful <HI>Vnion,</HI> than I am; so may the frivolous objection of any that would be hinderers of this <HI>Work</HI> (which God hath in my Person already established) be easily answer|ed; which can be none, except such as are either blinded with <HI>ignorance,</HI> or else transported with <HI>malice,</HI> being unable to live in a well-governed Common-wealth, and only de|lighting to fish in troubled waters: For if they would stand upon their <HI>reputation,</HI> and <HI>privileges</HI> of any of the King|doms; I pray you, were not both the Kingdoms <HI>Monar|chies</HI> from the beginning? And consequently, could ever the <HI>Body</HI> be counted without the <HI>Head,</HI> which was ever unsepara|bly joyned thereunto? So that as the <HI>honour</HI> and <HI>priviledges</HI> of any of the Kingdoms could not be divided from their <HI>So|vereign</HI>; so are they now confounded and joyned in my Per|son, who am equal and alike kindly <HI>Head</HI> to both. When this Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> was divided into so many petty Kingdoms (as I told you before) one of them eat up another, till they were all united into <HI>One.</HI> And yet, can <HI>Wiltshire</HI> or <HI>Devonshire,</HI> which were of the <HI>West-Saxons</HI> (although their Kingdom was of longest durance, and did by Conquest over|come divers of the rest of the little Kingdoms) make Claim to Priority of place or Honour before <HI>Su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sex, Essex,</HI> or other <HI>Shires,</HI> which were Conquered by them? And have <HI>We</HI> not the like <HI>experience</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>France,</HI> being compo|sed of divers <HI>Dutchies,</HI> and one after another Conquered by the <HI>Sword</HI>? For even as little <HI>Brooks</HI> lose their Names by run|ning and falling into great <HI>Rivers,</HI> and the very name and me|mory of great <HI>Rivers</HI> swallowed up in the <HI>Ocean</HI>: so by the conjunction of divers little Kingdoms into One, are all these private differences and questions swallowed up. And since the success was happy of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kingdoms Conquered by the <HI>Spear</HI> of <HI>Bellona</HI>; how much greater <HI>reason</HI> have <HI>We</HI> to ex|pect a happy issue of this greater <HI>Vnion,</HI> which is only fast|ned and bound up by the <HI>Wedding-Ring</HI> of <HI>Astrea?</HI> And as

God hath made <HI>Scotland</HI> (the one half of this <HI>Island</HI>) to enjoy my birth, and the first and most imperfect half of my life; and you here to enjoy the perfect and last half thereof: so can I not think, that any would be so injurious to me, no not in their thoughts and wishes, as to cut asunder the one half of Me from the other.

And although since mine <HI>entry</HI> into this Kingdom, I have both by meeting with divers of the <HI>Ecclesiastical state,</HI> and likewise by divers Procla|mations clearly declared my mind in <HI>points</HI> of <HI>Religion,</HI> yet do I not think it amiss in this so solemn an <HI>Audience</HI> to take occasion to discover somewhat of the secrets of my heart in that mat|ter. For I shall never (with Gods grace) be ashamed to make publick <HI>profession</HI> thereof upon all occasions, lest <HI>God</HI> should be ashamed of me before <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Angels</HI>; especially lest at this time men might presume further upon the misknowledg of my meaning to trouble this <HI>Parliament</HI> than were convenient.</P><P>At my first coming, although I found but one <HI>Religion,</HI> and that which by my self is professed, publickly allowed, and by the Law maintained; yet found I another sort of <HI>Religion,</HI> besides a private <HI>Sect,</HI> lurking within the bowels of this <HI>Nation.</HI> The first is the true <HI>Religion,</HI> which by me is professed, and by Law is established: The second is, the falsly called <HI>Catholicks,</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="21">
but truly <HI>Papists</HI>: The third which I call a <HI>Sect</HI> rather than a <HI>Religion,</HI> is the <HI>Puritans</HI> and <HI>Novelists,</HI> who do not so far dif|fer from us in <HI>points</HI> of <HI>Religion,</HI> as in their confused form of <HI>policy</HI> and <HI>parity,</HI> being ever discontented with the present <HI>Go|vernment,</HI> and impatient to suffer any <HI>superiority,</HI> which ma|keth their <HI>Sects</HI> insufferable in any well governed Common|wealth. But as for my course towards them, I remit it to my <HI>Proclamations</HI> made upon that <HI>subject.</HI> And now for the <HI>Pa|pists,</HI> I must put a difference betwixt mine own private <HI>pro|fession</HI> of my <HI>salvation,</HI> and my <HI>politick</HI> Government of the <HI>Realm</HI> for the weal and quietness thereof. As for my own pro|fession, you have me your <HI>head</HI> now among you of the same <HI>Religion</HI> that the Body is of; As I am no stranger to you in Blood, no more am I a stranger to you in Faith, or in matters concerning the House of God. And although this my professi|on be according to my education, wherein (I thank God) I suckt the milk of Gods Truth, with the milk of my Nurse; yet I do here protest unto you, that I would never (for such a conceit of <HI>Constancy,</HI> or other prejudicate <HI>opinion</HI>) have so firmly kept my first <HI>profession,</HI> if I had not found it agreeable to all <HI>reason,</HI> and to the rule of my <HI>conscience.</HI> But I was never violent, nor unreasonable in my profession: I acknowledg the <HI>Roman Church</HI> to be our <HI>Mother Church,</HI> although defiled with some infirmities and corruptions, as the <HI>Iews</HI> were, be|fore they Crucified Christ. And as I am no enemy to the life of a sick man, because I would have his body purged of <HI>ill humours</HI>; no more am I an enemy to their <HI>Church,</HI> because I would have them reform their <HI>errors,</HI> not wishing the down-throwing of the Temple, but that it might be purged, and cleansed from <HI>corruption</HI>: otherwise how can they wish us to enter, if their <HI>house</HI> be not first made clean? But as I would be lother to dispense in the least point of mine own <HI>conscience,</HI> for any worldly respect, than the foolishest <HI>Precisian</HI> of them all, so would I be as sorry to streighten the <HI>politick</HI> Government of the bodies and minds of all my Subjects to my private <HI>Opinions</HI>: Nay, my mind was ever so free from persecu|tion, or inthralling of my Subjects in matters of <HI>consci|ence,</HI> as I hope those of that <HI>profession</HI> within this King|dom have a proof since my coming, that I was so far from increasing their <HI>burthens</HI> with <HI>Rehoboam,</HI> as I have so much as either time, occasion, or law could permit, lightned them. And even now at this time, have I been careful to revise and consider deeply upon the Laws made against them, that some <HI>overture</HI> might be made to the present <HI>Parliament</HI> for clearing these Laws by <HI>reason</HI> (which is the <HI>soul</HI> of the <HI>Law</HI>) in case they have been in times past, further, or more rigorously ex|tended by <HI>Iudges,</HI> than the meaning of the <HI>Law</HI> was, or might

tend to the hurt as well of the Innocent as of the guilty per|sons. And as to the persons of my Subjects which are of that <HI>profession,</HI> I must divide them into two ranks, <HI>Clericks</HI> and <HI>Laicks</HI>: for the <HI>Laicks,</HI> I ever thought them far more excu|sable than the other sort, because their <HI>Religion</HI> containeth such an ignorant, doubtful, and implicite kind of <HI>Faith</HI> grounded upon their <HI>Church,</HI> that except they do generally believe whatsoever their Teachers please to affirm, they can not be thought guilty of these particular Points of <HI>Heresies,</HI> and <HI>Corruptions,</HI> which their Teachers so wilfully profess. And again, I must subdivide the <HI>Laicks</HI> into two <HI>ranks</HI>; which are, either quiet and well-minded men, peaceable <HI>Subjects,</HI> who either being old, retain their first drunk-in liquor, upon a certain shamefacedness to be thought curious, or change|able: Or being young men, through evil <HI>education,</HI> have been nursed and brought up upon such <HI>venom,</HI> instead of wholsome <HI>nutriment</HI>; And this sort of People, I would be sorry to pu|nish their <HI>Bodies</HI> for the <HI>error</HI> of their <HI>minds,</HI> the <HI>reformation</HI> whereof must only come of <HI>God,</HI> and the true <HI>Spirit.</HI> But the other <HI>rank</HI> of <HI>Laicks,</HI> who either through <HI>curiosity,</HI> affectation of <HI>novelty,</HI> or discontentment, have changed their Coats, on|ly to be <HI>factious,</HI> stirrers of <HI>sedition,</HI> and perturbers of the Common-wealth, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s giveth a ground to Me (the <HI>Magistrate</HI>) to take better heed to their proceedings, and to correct their <HI>obstinacy.</HI></P><P>But for the <HI>Clericks,</HI> I must directly say and affirm, that as long as they maintain one special point of their <HI>Doctrine,</HI> and another of their <HI>Practiec,</HI> they are no way sufferable to remain in this Kingdom. The point of <HI>Doctrine</HI> is, that arrogant and ambitious <HI>Supremacy</HI> of their <HI>Head</HI> the <HI>Pope,</HI> whereby he not only claims to be <HI>Spiritual Head</HI> of all <HI>Christians,</HI> but al|so to have an <HI>Imperial</HI> Civil power over all <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Empe|rors,</HI> dethroning and decrowning <HI>Princes</HI> with his foot as pleaseth him, and dispensing and disposing of all <HI>Kingdoms</HI> and <HI>Empires</HI> at his Appetite. The other Point which they ob|serve, in continual Practice, is the <HI>Assassinates</HI> and <HI>Murthers</HI> of <HI>Kings</HI>; thinking it no sin, but rather a matter of salvation, to do all actions of <HI>Rebellion</HI> and <HI>Hostility</HI> against their <HI>Natural Soveraign Lord,</HI> if he be once <HI>cursed,</HI> his <HI>Subjects</HI> discharged of their <HI>Fidelity,</HI> and his <HI>Kingdom</HI> given a <HI>prey,</HI> by that three-Crowned <HI>Monarch,</HI> or rather <HI>Monster,</HI> their <HI>Head.</HI> And in this Point I have no occasion to speak further here, saving that I could wish from my heart it would please God to make me one of the <HI>Members</HI> of such a general <HI>Christian Vnion</HI> in <HI>Reli|gion,</HI> as (laying wilfulness aside on both <HI>hands</HI>) we might meet in the midst, which is the center, and perfection of all things.

It consists in these two <HI>Points</HI>; In making of <HI>Laws</HI> at certain Times, which is only at such Times as this, in <HI>Parliament</HI>; or in the careful <HI>Execution</HI> of the <HI>Laws</HI> at other Times. As for the Making of them, I will thus far faithfully promise un|to you, that I will ever prefer the <HI>Weal</HI> of the <HI>Body</HI> above any particular or private ends of my <HI>Own,</HI> thinking ever the Weal of the Commonwealth to be the greatest Weal, and worldly <HI>felicity</HI>: A Point wherein a lawful King doth directly differ from a Tyrant. But at this time I am only thus far to forwarn you in that <HI>Point,</HI> that you beware to seek the making of too many <HI>Laws,</HI> for two especial <HI>Reasons</HI>; First, because <HI>In corruptis|sima Republica plurimae leges</HI>; And the execution of some good Laws is far more profitable in a Common-wealth, than to burthen <HI>mens memories</HI> with making too many of them. And next, because the making of too many Laws in one <HI>Parlia|ment,</HI> will bring in Confusion, for want of leisure, wisely to deliberate before you conclude; for the <HI>Bishop</HI> said well to day, That to <HI>Deliberation</HI> a large time would be given, but to <HI>Execution</HI> a greater promptness was required. As for the Execution of good Law, it hath been very wisely and ho|nourably foreseen, and ordered by my Predecessors in this Kingdom, in planting such a number of <HI>Iudges,</HI> and all sorts of <HI>Magistrates,</HI> in convenient places, for execution of the same. And therefore must I now turn to you that are <HI>Iudges,</HI> and <HI>Magistrates</HI> under me, as mine Eyes and Ears in this case: I can say no otherwise to you, than as <HI>Ezekias</HI> the good King of <HI>Iuda</HI> said to their <HI>Iudges, Remember that the Thrones you sit on are Gods, and neither yours nor mine.</HI> And as you must be answerable to me, so must both <HI>you</HI> and <HI>I</HI> be answerable to <HI>God</HI> for the due Execution of <HI>Our Offices.</HI> That Place is no Place for you to utter your Affections in; you must not there

For the difference betwixt a Rightful King, and an Usurping Tyrant, is this; That the proud and ambitious Tyrant doth think his <HI>Kingdom</HI> and <HI>People</HI> are ordai|ned for satisfaction of his <HI>desires,</HI> and unreasonable <HI>appetite</HI>; The <HI>righteous</HI> and <HI>just King</HI> doth by the <HI>contrary,</HI> acknowledg himself to be ordained for procuring the <HI>wealth</HI> and <HI>prosperity</HI> of his <HI>People,</HI> and that his greatest and principal <HI>worldly felicity</HI> must consist in their <HI>prosperity</HI>: If you be rich, I cannot be poor; if you be happy, I cannot but be fortunate; and I protest, that your welfare shall ever be my greatest care and contentment. And that I am a <HI>Servant,</HI> is most true; that as I am a <HI>Head</HI> and <HI>Governour</HI> of all the People in my <HI>Dominions,</HI> who are my <HI>Natu|ral Vassals,</HI> and <HI>Subjects,</HI> considering them in <HI>numbers,</HI> and distinct <HI>ranks</HI>; So if we will take the People as one <HI>Body</HI> and <HI>Mass,</HI> then as the <HI>Head</HI> is <HI>ordained</HI> for the <HI>Body,</HI> and not the <HI>Body</HI> for the <HI>Head</HI>; so must a <HI>righteous King</HI> know himself to be ordained for his <HI>People,</HI> and not his <HI>People</HI> for <HI>Him</HI>: For although a <HI>King</HI> and his <HI>People</HI> be <HI>Relata,</HI> yet can he be no <HI>King</HI> if he want <HI>People</HI> and <HI>Subjects.</HI> But there be many <HI>People</HI> in the <HI>World</HI> that lack a <HI>Head</HI>; wherefore I will never be ashamed to confess it my <HI>Principal Honour,</HI> to be the great Servant of the Common|wealth; and ever think the <HI>Prosperity</HI> thereof to be my greatest <HI>felicity,</HI> as I have already said.</P><P><PB N="24" REF="25"> But as it was the whole Body of this Kingdom (with an uniform assent and harmony) which did so far oblige me, so is my thankfulness due to the whole <HI>State.</HI> For even as in Matter of <HI>faults, Quod &agrave; multis peccatur, impun&egrave; peccatur</HI>; even so in the Matter of <HI>virtuous</HI> and good <HI>deeds,</HI> which are done by the willing Consent and Harmony of the whole <HI>Body,</HI> no particular Person can justly claim thanks, as proper to him, for the same: And therefore I must here make a little <HI>Apo|logie</HI> for my self, in that I could not satisfie the particular <HI>hu|mours</HI> of every <HI>Person</HI> that looked for some Advancement or Reward at my hand, since my entry into this Kingdom. Three kinds of things were craved of me, <HI>Advancement</HI> to <HI>ho|nour, Preferment</HI> to place of <HI>Credit</HI> about my <HI>Person,</HI> and <HI>Re|ward</HI> in Matters of <HI>Land</HI> or <HI>Profit.</HI> If I had bestowed Ho|nour upon all, no man could have been advanced to Honour; for the Degrees of Honour do consist in preferring some above their Fellows: If every man had the like access to my <HI>Per|son,</HI> then no man could have it: and if I had bestowed Lands and Rewards upon every man, the <HI>Fountain</HI> of my <HI>Liberality,</HI> would have been so exhausted, as I should want Means to be liberal to any man. Yet was I not so sparing, but I may without Vaunting affirm, that I have enlarged my <HI>favour</HI> in all the three Degrees, towards as many and more, than ever King of <HI>England</HI> did, in so short a space. No, I rather crave your <HI>pardon,</HI> that I have been so bountiful: For if the <HI>means</HI> of the <HI>Crown</HI> be wasted, whither should I have recourse but to you my <HI>Subjects,</HI> and be burthensome to you? which I should be lothest to do of any King alive. Two special <HI>Causes</HI> mo|ved me to be so open-handed, whereof the one was <HI>reasonable</HI> and <HI>honourable,</HI> but the other (I will not be ashamed to confess unto you) proceeded of my own <HI>infirmity.</HI> That which was Just and Honourable, was, that being so far beholden to the <HI>Body</HI> of the whole <HI>State,</HI> I thought I could not refuse to let some small <HI>Brooks</HI> run out of the <HI>Fountain</HI> of my Thankfulness to the whole, for refreshing of particular Persons, that were <HI>Members</HI> of that <HI>Multitude.</HI> The other which proceeded out of mine own Infirmity, was, the <HI>Multitude</HI> and importunity of <HI>Suters.</HI> But although <HI>Reason</HI> come by infusion in a manner, yet <HI>Experience</HI> groweth with time and labour: And therefore do I not doubt, but Experience will teach the particular <HI>Sub|jects</HI> of this Kingdom, not to be so importune and undiscreet in craving; and Me not to be so easily and lightly moved, in granting that which may be <HI>harmful</HI> to my <HI>Estate,</HI> and conse|quently to the whole Kingdom.</P><P>And thus at length having declared unto you my mind, My Conclusion shall only now be, to excuse my Self, in case you have not found such <HI>Eloquence</HI> in my <HI>Speech,</HI> as peradventure
<PB N="25" REF="25">
you might have looked for at my <HI>hands.</HI> I might alledg the great weight of my Affairs, and my continual <HI>business,</HI> and di|straction, that I could never have leisure to think upon what I was to speak; And I might also alledg, that my first <HI>sight</HI> of this so Famous and Honourable an Assembly, might like|wise breed some impediment: But leaving these excuses, I will plainly, and freely, in my manner, tell you the true Cause of it; which is, That it becometh a King, in my opinion, to use no other <HI>Eloquence</HI> than plainness and sincerity. By plain|ness, I mean, that his <HI>Speeches</HI> should be so clear, and void of all ambiguity, that they may not be thrown, nor rent in sun|der, in contrary senses, like the old <HI>Oracles</HI> of the <HI>Pagan gods</HI>: And by Sincerity, I understand, that <HI>uprightness</HI> and <HI>honesty</HI> which ought to be in a Kings whole <HI>Speeches,</HI> and <HI>Actions</HI>; that as far as a <HI>King</HI> is in <HI>Honour</HI> erected above any of his <HI>Subjects,</HI> so far should he strive in <HI>Sincerity</HI> to be above them all, and that his <HI>tongue</HI> should be ever the true <HI>Messenger</HI> of his <HI>heart.</HI> And this sort of <HI>Eloquence</HI> you may ever assuredly look for at my <HI>hands.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Thus the <HI>Beams</HI> of <HI>Majesty</HI> had an influence upon every branch and leaf of the Kingdom, by reflecting upon the <HI>Root,</HI> their <HI>Representative Body</HI>; every particular expecting what fruit this <HI>Sun-shine</HI> would produce; striving as much to insinuate into <HI>him,</HI> as he did into the <HI>general,</HI> so that there was a Reci|procal <HI>Harmony</HI> between the King and the People, because they <HI>courted</HI> one another. But when the Kings <HI>Bounty</HI> contracted it self into private Favourites (as it did afterwards) bestowing the affection he <HI>promised</HI> the whole people, upon one man; when the golden showers they gaped for, dropt into some few cha|nels, their <HI>passions</HI> flew higher than their <HI>hopes.</HI> The Kings aims were, to unite the two Kingdoms, so that the one might <HI>cor|roborate</HI> the other, to make good that part of his Speech (by this intermixtion) wherein he divides <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> into halves: But the <HI>English</HI> stumbled at that <HI>partition,</HI> thinking it an unequal <HI>division,</HI> and fearing that the <HI>Scots</HI> (creeping into <HI>English</HI> Lordships, and <HI>English</HI> Ladies Beds, in both which alrea|dy they began to be active) might quickly make their least <HI>half</HI> the predominant part.</P>

were to keep close to the Kings affections, and not to start from him.

<P>It was answered, That <HI>Speech</HI> brought the <HI>captivity</HI> of the <HI>one,</HI> they having dis-joyned their strength.</P>
<P>The <HI>Party opposing</HI> said, If we admit them into our <HI>Liberties,</HI> we shall be over-run with them, as Cattle (naturally) pent up by a slight Hedg, will over it into a better <HI>soyl,</HI> and a Tree ta|ken from a barren place will thrive to excessive, and exuberant Branches in a better, witness the <HI>multiplicities</HI> of the <HI>Scots</HI> in <HI>Polonia,</HI></P>
<P>To which it was answer'd, That if they had not <HI>means, place, custom,</HI> and <HI>imployment</HI> (not like <HI>Beasts</HI> but <HI>Men</HI>) they would starve in a plentiful <HI>soyl,</HI> though they came into it; and what <HI>spring-tide</HI> and <HI>confluence</HI> of that <HI>Nation</HI> have housed and fami|lied themselves among us, these four years of the Kings reign? And they will never live so meanly here as they do in <HI>Polonia</HI>; for they had rather discover their poverty abroad than at home. Besides, there is a question whether <HI>England</HI> be fully peopled, witness the drowned Grounds, and Common-wasts; the ruins and decays of ancient Towns in this <HI>Realm</HI>; Witness how many serve in the <HI>Parliament</HI> for desolate <HI>Burroughs</HI>; Witness our Wasts by Sea, as well as by Land, suffering the <HI>Flemings</HI> to carry away all our <HI>Fishing,</HI> the sinews of our industry being slackned, we want active <HI>spirits</HI> to <HI>corroborate</HI> them by their <HI>example</HI>: Besides the planting <HI>Ireland,</HI> fully abounding with Rivers, Havens, Woods, Quarries, good Soyl, and temperate Climate.

<P>The other side objected, That the <HI>Fundamental Laws</HI> of both Kingdoms are divers, and it is declared, they shall so continue, and therefore it would not be reasonable to proceed to this <HI>Na|turalization,</HI> whereby to indow them with our <HI>Rights,</HI> except they should receive, and submit to our <HI>Laws.</HI></P>

It was answered, That in the Administration of the <HI>World</HI> under God, the great <HI>Monarch,</HI> his Laws are divers; one Law in <HI>Spirits,</HI> another in <HI>Bodies,</HI> one Law in <HI>Regions Celestial,</HI> an|other in <HI>Elementary,</HI> and yet the <HI>Creatures</HI> are all one <HI>mass,</HI> or lump.

<P>To which it was replyed, that these are only Flourishes of <HI>Rhetorick</HI>; for God (who is the only <HI>Disposer</HI> of all his <HI>Crea|tures</HI>) keeps them in <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Obedience</HI> to <HI>Him,</HI> by a Law which they cannot deviate from, unless he withdraws his pre|serving Hand from them: But betwixt Man and Man, or Realm and Realm, there can be no such Tie, or Obligation, to hold an <HI>Vnity,</HI> where they have various <HI>Laws,</HI> and various <HI>Priviledges.</HI> And for the immunities given to the <HI>Irish</HI> (for some <HI>Ages</HI> past) they were <HI>English Colonies</HI> sent there to plant, being a great part of them <HI>Natives</HI> with us, of the same blood and stock, with whom we are ingrafted by Time, and made (as it were) one Body, the better to secure their obedience, and hinder any <HI>League</HI> or <HI>Amity</HI> with a Foreign <HI>Nation.</HI> But <HI>Scotland</HI> hath an in|tire <HI>Vnion</HI> with the <HI>French,</HI> continued for some hundreds of years, that is indissolvable, and therefore incompetent, yet to the <HI>freedoms</HI> of <HI>England.</HI> When we have had as much experience of the <HI>Friendship of Scotland,</HI> as of them, we shall incline to a more in|timate <HI>Vnion.</HI> Besides there is an inequality in the <HI>Portunes</HI> of the two <HI>Nations</HI>; and by this <HI>Commixture,</HI> there may ensue ad|vantage to them, and loss to us.</P>
<P>To the latter part was answered, <HI>Beatius est dare qu&agrave;m acci|pere</HI>: And <HI>Edward</HI> the First, among other Commendations of <HI>War,</HI> and <HI>Policy,</HI> none was more celebrated than his purpose and enterprize, for the Conquest of <HI>Scotland</HI>; as not bending his <HI>Designs</HI> to glorious Acquests abroad, but solid strength at home; which, if it had succeded, could not but have brought in those inconveniences, of the Commixture of a more <HI>opulent</HI> Kingdom with a less; for it is not the yoke either of <HI>Laws</HI> or <HI>Arms,</HI> that can alter the <HI>nature</HI> of the <HI>Climate,</HI> or the <HI>nature</HI> of the <HI>Soil</HI>; neither is it the <HI>manner</HI> of the <HI>Commixture,</HI> that can alter the <HI>nature</HI> of the <HI>Commixture</HI>; and therefore if it were good for us then, it is good for us now; and not to be prized the less, be|cause we paid not so dear for it.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="36">They strive further to prove, That the benefit of <HI>Naturaliza|tion</HI> is by <HI>Law,</HI> to as many as have been, or shall be born, since the Kings coming to the <HI>Crown</HI>; for there is no more than to bring the <HI>Ante-nati</HI> unto the <HI>degree</HI> of <HI>Post-nati,</HI> that <HI>Men</HI> grown may be in no worse case than <HI>Children,</HI> and elder <HI>Brothers</HI> in no worse condition than younger <HI>Brothers.</HI> That if any ob|ject the <HI>Law</HI> is not so, but that the <HI>Post-nati</HI> are <HI>Aliens</HI> as the rest, it is contrary to the Reason of <HI>Law.</HI> The Wisdom of the Common Laws of <HI>England</HI> is admirable, in distribution of the Benefit, and Perfection of the Law, according to the several conditions of <HI>Persons,</HI> The <HI>Degrees</HI> are four, two of <HI>Aliens,</HI> and two of <HI>Subjects</HI>: The first <HI>Degree</HI> is of an <HI>Alien</HI> born under a King or State, that is an Enemy; if such an one come into the Kingdom without safe <HI>conduct,</HI> it is at his <HI>peril,</HI> the <HI>Law</HI> giveth him no <HI>protection,</HI> neither of Body, Lands, nor Goods; so as if he be slain, there is no remedy by any appeal, at the Parties sute, though she were an <HI>English Woman</HI>; though at the Kings sute the Case may be otherwise, in regard of the offence to the <HI>Peace,</HI> and <HI>Crown,</HI> The second <HI>Degree</HI> is of an <HI>Alien</HI> that is born under <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Allegiance</HI> of a King, or State, that is a Friend; unto such a Person the <HI>Law</HI> doth impart a greater benefit and protection concerning things personal, transitory, and move|able, as Goods and Chattels, Contracts, and the like, but not concerning Free-hold, and Inheritance; and the <HI>Reason</HI> is, be|cause he <HI>may</HI> be an Enemy, though he <HI>be</HI> not; for the State where he was born, may enter into <HI>Hostility</HI>; and therefore as the <HI>Law</HI> hath but a Transitory assurance of him, so it rewards him with Transitory <HI>benefits.</HI> The third <HI>Degree</HI> is of a <HI>Subject,</HI> who having been an <HI>Alien,</HI> is made free by <HI>Charter,</HI> and <HI>Deni|zation</HI>: To such a one the <HI>Law</HI> doth impart yet a more ample <HI>benefit,</HI> for it gives him a power to purchase <HI>Free-hold,</HI> and In|heritance to his own use, and likewise inables his <HI>Children</HI> (born after his <HI>Denization</HI>) to inherit: But yet he cannot make Title, or convey any <HI>Pedigree</HI> from any <HI>Ancestour Paramount</HI>; for the <HI>Law</HI> thinks not good to make him in the same <HI>Degree</HI> with a <HI>Subject</HI> born, because he was once an <HI>Alien,</HI> and so might have been an <HI>Enemy</HI>; and <HI>Affections</HI> cannot be so setled by any <HI>bene|fit,</HI> as when from their <HI>Nativity</HI> they are inbred, and inherent. The fourth <HI>Degree,</HI> and the perfect <HI>Degree,</HI> is of such a <HI>Person,</HI> as neither is Enemy, nor can be Enemy in time to come, nor would have been Enemy at any time past; and therefore the <HI>Law</HI> gives unto him the full <HI>benefit</HI> of <HI>Naturalization.</HI> Now if these be the true steps and paces of the <HI>Law,</HI> no man can deny, but whosoever is born under the Kings <HI>obedience,</HI> never could, <HI>in aliquo puncto temporis,</HI> be an Enemy; and therefore in reason of <HI>Law</HI> is <HI>Naturalized.</HI> So though the <HI>Scots</HI> seem to be in Rea|son, <HI>Naturales ipso jure,</HI> yet it is not <HI>superfluous</HI> to have it done
<PB N="37" REF="36">
by <HI>Parliament</HI>; for it will shew the <HI>World</HI> our <HI>love</HI> to them, and good agreement with them.</P>
<P>Then they shewed by authority of <HI>History,</HI> and <HI>Experience,</HI> the Inconveniencies that may grow, if this <HI>Vnion</HI> of <HI>Naturali|zation</HI> doth not close, and bind up the Veins, so as to make it one perfect Body; For else it may be apt to open, and break out again upon all <HI>occasions,</HI> and <HI>relapse</HI> to the detriment of both: Ripping up ancient <HI>Stories</HI> of the <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Latines,</HI> and the <HI>Wars</HI> they had, meerly for want of this <HI>Vnion,</HI> and never were at quiet till they injoyed it.

A <HI>Rebellion</HI> grew among them, which a <HI>Royal Army</HI> with difficulty suppressed, and (they being made one incorporated <HI>Body</HI> with the rest of <HI>Spain</HI>) perpetua|ted <HI>Peace</HI> to <HI>Posterity.</HI></P>
<P>The like example was betwixt <HI>Florence</HI> and <HI>Pisa.</HI> And what|soever Kingdoms and States have been United, and that <HI>Vnion</HI> corroborated by the <HI>Bonds</HI> of <HI>Naturalization,</HI> you shall never ob|serve them afterward, upon any occasion to break or sever a|gain: Whereof divers Provinces in <HI>France,</HI> by time annexed to that <HI>Crown,</HI> are further witnesses. So that except they proceed to this <HI>Naturalization,</HI> these <HI>Realms</HI> will be in continual danger to divide and break again.</P>
<P>Next they shew the Benefits to be Security and Greatness. Surety, by stopping up the Postern-gates of our Enemies, so that we shall not be so much a temptation to the <HI>ambition</HI> of Foreign|ers, when their Approaches and Avenues are taken away: For having so little <HI>success</HI> when they had these advantages, they will have less comfort when they want them. And Greatness by this <HI>Vnion</HI> must needs follow: For having so many Iron-han|ded men in these three Kingdoms, we shall not only pluck Gold from the (once poor) <HI>Spaniards Indian-mines,</HI> but by our <HI>Arms</HI> keep in <HI>awe</HI> the whole <HI>Christian World.</HI></P>
<P>These <HI>Arguments</HI> prest with gilded <HI>Oratory</HI> by the <HI>Solicitor</HI> and his <HI>partakers,</HI> could not prevail, though urged with all the <HI>power Wit</HI> could invent, or <HI>Hope</HI> aim at: For being new budded in <HI>Court,</HI> he was one of those that smoothed his <HI>way</HI> to a full <HI>ripe|ness</HI>; by <HI>liqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rish</HI> and <HI>pleasing</HI> passages, which he at last attained to, being made Lord <HI>Chancellor</HI> of <HI>England.</HI> But such <HI>sweets,</HI> though delightful at present, breed <HI>rottenness</HI> in the end: for he withered, and came to nothing, as in due time shall be ex|pressed.</P>

<P>Thirdly, They all agree they are no <HI>Aliens,</HI> and yet will not allow them to be <HI>Natural.</HI> That he was informed by their own <HI>Iudges</HI> and <HI>Lawyers,</HI> at his first access to the <HI>Crown,</HI> that there was a difference between the <HI>Ante</HI> and <HI>Post-nati</HI> of each Kingdom; which caused him to publish a <HI>Proclamation,</HI> that the <HI>Post-nati</HI> were <HI>Naturalized</HI> by his accession; but he confesses, <HI>Iudges</HI> may err, so may the <HI>Lawyer's</HI> on their side: Therefore he admonishes them to beware to disgrace, either his <HI>Proclamations,</HI> or the <HI>Iudg|es,</HI> for so they may disgrace both their <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Laws</HI>; who have <HI>power,</HI> when the <HI>Parliament</HI> is ended, to try them both for Lands and Lives.</P>
<P>And for some of them who with their flattering <HI>speeches</HI> would have the <HI>Ante-nati</HI> preferred, alledging their <HI>merit</HI> in my <HI>service,</HI> such <HI>Discourses</HI> have <HI>mel in ore, &amp; fel in corde</HI>; carrying an outward appearance of <HI>love</HI> to the <HI>Vnion,</HI> but a contrary <HI>re|solution</HI> in their <HI>hearts.</HI> For the King would have them know, it lies within the compass of his <HI>Prerogative</HI> to prefer whom he pleases to any <HI>Dignity</HI> Civil or Ecclesiastical. But he is so far from prejudicing the <HI>English,</HI> that he is willing to bind himself to reasonable <HI>Restrictions.</HI> Besides, it is a special Point of the Kings <HI>Prerogative,</HI> to make <HI>Aliens, Citizens</HI>; and in any case wherein the <HI>Law</HI> is thought not to be clear, <HI>Rex est Iudex</HI>; for he is <HI>Lex loquens,</HI> supplying the <HI>Law</HI> where it wants. But this he
<PB N="39" REF="37">
speaks as knowing what belongs to a <HI>King,</HI> not intending to press it further than may agree with their <HI>loves,</HI> and stand with the conveniency of both <HI>Nations.</HI></P>
<P>The inconveniences supposed to arise from <HI>Scotland,</HI> are pre|tended to be,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. An evil affection in the <HI>Scots</HI> to the <HI>Vnion.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the <HI>Vnion</HI> is incompetible.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That the Gain is small, or none.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>If this be so, Why is there talk of an <HI>Vnion?</HI> For the first, They alledg the averseness of the <HI>Scots,</HI> from the <HI>Preface,</HI> and <HI>Body</HI> of their <HI>Act</HI>; where they decare, they will remain an ab|solute and <HI>free Monarchy,</HI> and not alter the <HI>Fundamental Laws</HI> of the Kingdom. And yet in the beginning of this <HI>Session</HI> of <HI>Parliament,</HI> the <HI>opinion</HI> was current, that <HI>Scotland</HI> was greedy of this <HI>Vnion,</HI> and pursued it with so much <HI>violence,</HI> that they cared not for the strictness of the Conditions, so they might attain the <HI>substance,</HI> and <HI>end.</HI> And yet they now say, they are backwards, which is a Contradiction; for how can they both beg and deny the same thing, at one and the same time? And by preserving their <HI>Fundamental Laws,</HI> they mean, those <HI>Laws</HI> by which <HI>Confusion</HI> is avoided, and their Kings <HI>Succession,</HI> and <HI>Monarchy</HI> maintained. To which he <HI>Declares,</HI> That he is in de|scent three hundred years before <HI>Christ,</HI> not meaning (as they do) their Common Law; for the <HI>Scots</HI> have no <HI>Law</HI> but that which is <HI>Ius Regis.</HI> And for their desire of continuing a <HI>free Monarchy,</HI> he hopes they mean not he should set <HI>Garrisons</HI> over them, as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> do over <HI>Sicily</HI> and <HI>Naples.</HI></P>
<P>And then he tells them, That he governs <HI>Scotland</HI> with his <HI>Pen</HI>; he writes, and doth more by a Clerk of the <HI>Council,</HI> than others could do by the <HI>Sword.</HI> And though he knows there are many seditious Persons in that Kingdom, that may talk <HI>lewdly</HI> enough, yet none of them ever spake dishonourably of <HI>England,</HI> as they have done of <HI>Scotland</HI>: For if any man speaks any thing uncomely there, the <HI>Chancellor</HI> by his <HI>Authority</HI> inter|rupts him; but here they have freedom to speak what they list, and as long as they list, without contradiction. Then the King shews what the <HI>Laws</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> are.</P>
<P N="1">1. Those which concern <HI>Tenures, Wards, Liveries, Signiories,</HI> and <HI>Lands,</HI> are drawn out of the <HI>Chancery</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> brought by <HI>Iames</HI> the First (who was bred up here) and differ only in terms.</P>
<P>The second are <HI>Statute Laws,</HI> to which he hopes they will be no <HI>Strangers.</HI></P>
<P>The third is the <HI>Civil Law,</HI> brought out of <HI>France</HI> by <HI>Iames</HI> the Fifth; and serve only to supply in such Cases, where the <HI>Municipal Laws</HI> are defective: So that he hopes it is no hard matter to unite the <HI>People</HI> together, who are in effect already
<PB N="40" REF="38">
<HI>subject</HI> to the same <HI>Law.</HI> And whereas it is <HI>Objected,</HI> that the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> hath not a <HI>Negative Voice</HI> in <HI>Parliament,</HI> but must pass the <HI>Laws</HI> agreed on by the <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Commons</HI>: He assures them, that the <HI>form</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> there, is nothing in|clined to <HI>Popularity</HI>: For about twenty days before the <HI>Par|liament</HI> begins, <HI>Proclamation</HI> is made throughout the Kingdom, that all Bills to be exhibited that <HI>Session,</HI> be delivered to the <HI>Master</HI> of the <HI>Rolls</HI> by a certain day: Then they are brought to the King, perused, and considered by him; and only such as he allows, are put into the <HI>Chancellors</HI> hand, to be pro|pounded that <HI>Parliament,</HI> and no other. And if any man speak of any other Matter than is in this <HI>Form</HI> first allowed by <HI>him,</HI> the <HI>Chancellor</HI> tells him, that there is no such Bill allowed by the <HI>King</HI>: And when they are past for <HI>Laws,</HI> he ratifies and confirms them, first racing out what he doth not approve of. And if this be to be called a <HI>Negative Voice</HI> in <HI>Parliament,</HI> then he hath <HI>one.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2"> For the <HI>Vnion</HI> betwixt the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Scots,</HI> which makes this <HI>Vnion</HI> so incompetible; he assures them, it was a <HI>League</HI> only made between the <HI>Kings,</HI> not the <HI>People.</HI> For <HI>Scotland</HI> be|ing solicited by <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France</HI> at one Time, for a <HI>League</HI> Offensive and Defensive, against each others <HI>Enemies.</HI> There was a great <HI>Disputation</HI> maintained in <HI>favour</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> that they being our <HI>Neighbours</HI> joyned in one <HI>Continent,</HI> a strong and <HI>Powerful Nation,</HI> it would be more Security to the State of <HI>Scot|land</HI> to joyn in <HI>Amity</HI> with <HI>England,</HI> than with <HI>France,</HI> divided by the Sea, where they must abide the hazard of wind and wea|ther, and other Accidents that might hinder relief.</P>
<P>But on the contrary, it was alledged in the <HI>favour</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> That <HI>England</HI> ever sought to conquer <HI>Scotland,</HI> and therefore there would never be kept any <HI>sound Amity</HI>: Whereas <HI>France,</HI> lying more <HI>remote,</HI> claimed no <HI>interest,</HI> and therefore would be found a more <HI>constant</HI> and <HI>faithful Friend</HI>; so it was concluded on their Part.

<P>This urged with asseveration might have wrought much with the <HI>Parliament,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia|ment declined the Union.</NOTE> but that they apprehended a great incon|venience in such an <HI>Vnion,</HI> where the Laws and Government are of different <HI>natures.</HI> All were not <HI>Romans</HI> that were born <HI>subjects</HI> to the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> though St. <HI>Paul</HI> was born one, the <HI>Centurion</HI> was a purchaser. For notwithstanding all the former <HI>Arguments</HI> by the King, and his Ministers, the <HI>Parliament</HI> knew that it is true, That if <HI>Scotland</HI> had been Conquered, the only way to tie them to <HI>obedience,</HI> were to let them taste the <HI>sweets</HI> of <HI>English Liberties.</HI> But to let them sit Triumphing upon their own <HI>priviledges,</HI> and roam about among the <HI>English Freedoms,</HI> were to make them straggle too much. The <HI>Scots</HI> would not lessen, nor in the least derogate from the <HI>dignity</HI> of their long continued <HI>Monarchy,</HI> and the <HI>English</HI> thought they had no rea|son to come to them to derogate from themselves. The <HI>Parlia|ment</HI> only feared the Kings <HI>Power</HI> would have such an influence upon the <HI>Iudges</HI> of the Kingdom; that the <HI>Scots</HI> would be <HI>natu|ralized</HI> too soon, they were resolved not to be accessary to it: which indeed some two years after was confirmed in <HI>Calvins</HI> case of <HI>post-nati,</HI> reported by the Lord Chief Justice <HI>Cook,</HI> who was fit <HI>metal</HI> for any <HI>stamp Royal,</HI> and adjudged by him, the Lord Chancellor <HI>Ellesmere,</HI> and most of the Judges of the King|dom in the <HI>Exchequer-Chamber,</HI> though many strong and valid <HI>Arguments</HI> were brought against it (<HI>such Power is in the breath of Kings</HI>!) and such <HI>soft stuff</HI> are Judges made of, that they can vary their <HI>Precedents,</HI> and <HI>model</HI> them into as many <HI>shapes</HI> as they please.

<P>The Lord Treasurer (by a Command from the King) instructs both <HI>Houses</HI> in their business, and what they shall do well to in|sist
<PB N="44" REF="42">
upon this <HI>Session.</HI> First, To supply his Majesties wants. Se|condly, To ease the people of their Grievances. They go com|monly yoakt together; for the peoples Grievances are the Kings Wants, and the Kings Wants are the peoples Grievan|ces, How can they be separated? If the King will always want, the people will always suffer: For Kings when they do want, lay commonly <HI>lawless</HI> impositions on the people, which they must take off again with a <HI>sum</HI> of money, and then they want again to a continued <HI>vicissitude.</HI></P>
<P>These two Propositions are sweetned by him with a third: Which is to make the <HI>Parliament</HI> witnesses of those great <HI>favours,</HI> and <HI>honours,</HI> that his Majesty intended his Royal Son, Prince <HI>Henry,</HI> in creating him Prince of <HI>Wales:</HI> Which though the King might do without a <HI>Parliament,</HI> and that divers Kings his <HI>Predecessors</HI> had done so, (as by many <HI>precedents</HI> was manifested) yet being desirous to have a happy <HI>Vnion</HI> betwixt him and his People, he would have nothing resound ill in their <HI>ears,</HI> from so eminent an instrument to the Kingdoms good as his Son. Then they excuse the Kings <HI>necessities,</HI> proceeding from his great <HI>disbursements.</HI> For the three hundred and fifty thou|sand pounds <HI>Subsidies,</HI> due in the late <HI>Queens</HI> time, he received with one hand, and paid her Debts with another, redeeming the <HI>Crown Lands</HI> which she had morgaged to the City. He kept an <HI>Army</HI> of nineteen thousand men in <HI>Ireland,</HI> for some time a foot; wherein a great many of the <HI>Nobility</HI> were Comman|ders, and other deserving <HI>Soldiers,</HI> that would have been ex|posed to want and penury, if not supplied: And it was not safe for the King to trust the inveterate <HI>malice</HI> of a new recon|ciled <HI>Enemy,</HI> without the <HI>Sword</HI> in his hand. The late <HI>Queens</HI> Funeral Charges were reckon'd up, which they hoped the <HI>Parliament</HI> would not repine at: Nor was it fit the King should come in as a private Person, bringing in one <HI>Crown</HI> on his <HI>head,</HI> and finding another here; or his <HI>Royal Consort,</HI> with our <HI>future Hopes</HI> (like so many precious <HI>Ienels</HI>) exposed to <HI>Robbers,</HI> with|out a <HI>Guard</HI> and <HI>Retinue?</HI> How fit was the <HI>Magnificence</HI> at the King of <HI>Denmarks</HI> being here? And how just that <HI>Ambassadors</HI> from Foreign Princes (more than ever this Crown received) should find those Entertainments and Gratuities, the want whereof would put a dim lustre abroad upon the most sparkling Jewels of the Crown; Besides the necessary Charge of sending <HI>Ambassadors</HI> to others, being concurrent and mutual <HI>Civilities</HI> a|mong Princes.</P>
<P>That these are the causes of the Kings wants, and not his ir|regular Bounty, though a <HI>magnificent</HI> mind is inseparable from the Majesty of a King. If he did not give, his <HI>subjects</HI> and <HI>ser|vants</HI> would live in a <HI>miserable Climate</HI>; And for his Bounty to those that were not born among us, it must be remembred, he
<PB N="45" REF="42">
was born among them; and not to have them taste of the bles|sing he hath attained, were to have him change his <HI>Vertue</HI> with his <HI>Fortune.</HI> Therefore they desire the Kings wants may be supplied; a thing easie to be granted, and not to be valued by Wise-men, nor spoken of without contempt. <HI>Philosophy</HI> saith, that all <HI>Riches</HI> are but <HI>food</HI> and <HI>rayment,</HI> the rest is <HI>nugatorium quiddam</HI>: And that it is but <HI>purior pars terrae,</HI> and therefore but <HI>crassior pars aquae,</HI> a thing unworthy the <HI>denial</HI> to such a King who is not only the wisest of Kings, but the very <HI>Image</HI> of an <HI>Angel,</HI> that hath brought good tidings, and setled us in the <HI>fru|ition</HI> of all good things. He whose depth of Knowledge as well as Conscience, deserves the Title of <HI>Fidei defensor</HI>; whose <HI>nu|merous Issue</HI> makes Foreign Princes study to keep their own, not look abroad. He that hath shut the back-door of the King|dom, and placed two Lions, a red and a yellow to secure it, who would have us live under our own <HI>Olive,</HI> that we may <HI>laetari &amp; benefacere.</HI> That none will wonder at the Want, or startle at the supply, but such as study to serve their own turns, and believe nothing but what they find written in the <HI>stories</HI> of their own <HI>ignorance.</HI> Among which those are to be reckon'd, who (hear|ing of an <HI>Order</HI> to bind up the printed <HI>Proclamations</HI> in a book, that the better notice may be taken of the things contained in them) have raised a bruit, that it was intended this <HI>Parliament</HI> to make <HI>Proclamations</HI> equal to the <HI>Laws,</HI> which never entred into the Kings heart; who is so far from governing by <HI>will</HI> and <HI>power,</HI> that he will yield to any <HI>motion</HI> from them, where|in they shall hold a just <HI>Diameter,</HI> and proportion among them|selves, and observe those <HI>Duties</HI> due to a great and gracious King.</P>
<P>Thus these Lords did please themselves and the King, by striving to keep the people in the milky way of <HI>Obedience,</HI> which they had long suckt in, and found the <HI>sweet</HI> of it tend|ing to nourishment, not yet meeting any Callous, or Brawny-constitution (which must harden them by degrees) nor yet finding their own Tempers grown Robust enough, by so harsh a <HI>diet</HI> as afterwards they met with. They therefore are willing to go on in the way pointed out to them, as <HI>Pupils</HI> follow their <HI>Masters,</HI> minding rather the <HI>smoothness</HI> of the Tract they saw, than the roughness of the end. Yet some of them, whose <HI>hopes</HI> were not so high mounted, and their <HI>spirits</HI> more; spoke plainly, <HI>That the whole wealth of</HI> England <HI>would not serve the Kings vast Bounty</HI>; therefore it was a vain thing to give him, that would give it away again: That Gold and Silver in <HI>Eden|burgh</HI> now in our <HI>Solomons</HI> time are like the <HI>stones</HI> in the <HI>streets,</HI> never so much glittering there, like a perpetual <HI>spring-time.</HI> Besides they look upon the Kings incroachments upon the pub|lick <HI>liberty,</HI> by undermining the <HI>Laws,</HI> taking notice of some

expressions that fell from him publickly at his dinner, in de|rogation of the <HI>Common Law,</HI> extolling highly the <HI>Civil Law</HI> before it; and approving a Book lately written by Doctor <HI>Cow|ell,</HI> a Civilian, against it: Which netled our great <HI>Lawyers,</HI> that had not some of them been raised so high, that they could not with that <HI>Court-gag</HI> look downwards, it had bred a contest.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The High-Commission a grievance.</NOTE>The <HI>High-Commission</HI> also began now to swell into a Grie|vance, which the <HI>Parliament</HI> complained of. Seldom is <HI>Authori|ty</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> exercised with <HI>Moderation</HI>: Every man must con|form to the <HI>Episcopal</HI> way, and quit his hold in <HI>Opinion,</HI> or safety. That <HI>Court</HI> was the Touch stone to try whether men were <HI>metal</HI> for their <HI>stamp</HI>; and if they were not soft enough to take such impressions as were put upon them, they were made <HI>malleable</HI> there, or else they could not pass current. This was the be|ginning of that <HI>mischief,</HI> which when it came to a full ripeness, made such a bloody Tincture in both Kingdoms, as never will be got out of the <HI>Bishops</HI> Lawn sleeves. And though these Ap|ples of strife thrown in the way did a little retard the course in hand, yet they carried not the prize: For the King according to his old wont (like a cunning <HI>Hunter</HI>) when they began to run counter, called them off, and at <HI>White-hall</HI> by one of his <HI>Le|ctures</HI> he strives to bring them into the way again; By laying himself open as in a Glass, wherein, if they could not <HI>see</HI> his <HI>heart,</HI> they might <HI>scent</HI> out his <HI>meaning,</HI> and so follow the chace which was to be pursued.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Kings Speech to both Houses.</NOTE>He tells them, though the Kings <HI>heart</HI> be in the hands of the Lord, yet he will set it before the eyes of the people: Assuring them that he never meant to govern by any Law, but the Law of the Land; though it be disputed among them, as if he had an intention to alter the Law, and govern by the absolute Power of a King. He knew, said he, the Power of Kings, re|sembling it to the <HI>Power Divine:</HI> For as God can create and de|stroy, make and unmake at his pleasure, so Kings can give <HI>life</HI> and <HI>death,</HI> judg <HI>all,</HI> and be judged of <HI>none.</HI> They can exalt low things, and abase high things, making the <HI>subjects</HI> like men at <HI>Chess,</HI> a <HI>pawn</HI> to take a <HI>Bishop</HI> or a <HI>Knight.</HI> (But he left out the power of a Pawn to take a Queen, or check a King). And when he had raised the Kings <HI>power</HI> to the height, with <HI>Vos dii estis,</HI> he brings them down again, with, <HI>They shall die like men</HI>: And that all Kings who are not <HI>Tyrants</HI> or perjur'd, will bound themselves within the limits of their Laws, and they that per|swade them the contrary, are <HI>Vipers</HI> and <HI>Pests</HI> both against them and the Common-wealth. Yet as it is <HI>Blasphemy</HI> to dispute what God may do, so it is <HI>Sedition</HI> in <HI>Subjects</HI> to dispute what a King may do in the height of his <HI>power.</HI> And as he will not have his <HI>subjects</HI> discourse of what he may do, so he will do no|thing
<PB N="47" REF="43">
but what shall be <HI>consonant</HI> to <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Reason.</HI> Then he strives to mitigate the sharpness of the words dropt from him at his Table to the <HI>disparagement</HI> of the <HI>Common Law,</HI> and as|sures them, though he likes the <HI>Civil Law</HI> very well, as being <HI>Lex Gentium,</HI> which maintains intercourse with foreign Nations, and sitted to the <HI>Ecclesiastical Courts, Court</HI> of <HI>Admiralty,</HI> and <HI>Courts</HI> of <HI>Request,</HI> yet he is so far from disavowing the <HI>Common Law,</HI> that he protests, if he were to chuse a new <HI>Law</HI> for this Kingdom, he would prefer it before any other <HI>National Law,</HI> yea, the <HI>Law of Moses,</HI> nay, without <HI>blasphemy,</HI> the very <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>God.</HI> Then he recalls himself, and tells them, That though for this <HI>Nation</HI> he had preferred the <HI>Common Law</HI> to the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> yet it is inferiour to the <HI>Iudicial Law</HI>: For no Book, or Law is free from <HI>corruption,</HI> but the Book and Law of God.</P>
<P>And therefore he could wish that three things specially were purged out of <HI>Common Law.</HI></P>
<P>First, That it were written in the <HI>vulgar Tongue,</HI> and made plain to the peoples understanding, that they might know what to obey, that the <HI>Lawyers</HI> in the <HI>Law,</HI> like the <HI>Romish Priests</HI> in the <HI>Gospel,</HI> might not keep the people in <HI>ignorance.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, That the <HI>Common Law</HI> might have a setled Text in all <HI>Cases,</HI> for being grounded upon old <HI>Customs, Reports,</HI> and <HI>Cases</HI> of former <HI>Iudges,</HI> called <HI>Responsa prudentum,</HI> which are not binding (for divers times <HI>Iudges</HI> disclaim them, and recede from the <HI>Iudgment</HI> of their <HI>Predecessors</HI>) it were good upon ma|ture deliberation, that the Exposition of the Law were set down by Act of Parliament, that the people might know what to depend upon.</P>
<P>Thirdly, There is in the Common Laws divers contrary <HI>Re|ports</HI> and <HI>Precedents,</HI> and divers <HI>Statutes</HI> and <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Parliament,</HI> that do cross one another, being so penned, that they may be taken in divers <HI>senses,</HI> therefore he could wish, they might be reviewed, and reconciled. And whereas he is thought an <HI>Ene|my</HI> to <HI>Prohibitions,</HI> he saith he is not ignorant of the <HI>necessity</HI> of them, if every <HI>stream</HI> might run in its own <HI>chanel,</HI> but the over|flowing, and super-abundance of them, in every Court, stri|ving to bring most grist to their own Mill, was a distemper fit to be cured, therefore he did not disallow the Use but the Abuse.</P>
<P>Then he closes with the House of Commons, and not only thanks them for the <HI>Bonefire</HI> they made of certain Papers which were presented <HI>Grievances</HI> from some discontented <HI>murmuring spirits,</HI> but he instructs them how to receive <HI>Grievances</HI> here|after: In which he would have them careful to avoid three things.</P>
<P>The first, That they meddle not with the main points of <HI>Go|vernment,</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="44">
that is his <HI>craft, Tractent fabrilia fabri.</HI> To meddle with that were to lessen him, who hath been thirty years at the Trade in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and served an Apprentiship of seven years here, therefore here needs no <HI>Phormios</HI> to teach <HI>Hanni|bal.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, He would not have such ancient Rights as he hath received from his <HI>Predecessors</HI> accounted <HI>Grievances,</HI> that were to judg him unworthy to injoy what they left him.</P>
<P>And lastly, That they should be careful not to present that for a <HI>Grievance,</HI> which is established by a <HI>Law</HI>; for it is very un|dutiful in <HI>Subjects</HI> to press their King wherein they are sure to be denyed. <HI>Complaints</HI> may be made unto them of the <HI>High-Commissioners,</HI> let the abuse appear then, and spare not, there may be <HI>errors</HI> among them, but to take away the <HI>Commission</HI> is to derogate from him, and it is now in his thoughts to rectifie it in a good proportion.</P>
<P>Then he shews the emergent cause of his great expences, since his coming to the Crown, which makes him desire a supply from them, confirming what the <HI>Lords</HI> formerly delivered; wherein he said, when they opened his <HI>necessities</HI> unto them, his <HI>purse</HI> only <HI>labour'd,</HI> now his <HI>desires</HI> are taken notice of both at home and abroad, his <HI>Reputation labours</HI> as well as his <HI>Purse</HI>; for the <HI>World</HI> will think it want of <HI>love</HI> in them, or <HI>merit</HI> in him, that both lessen'd their <HI>hearts,</HI> and tied up their <HI>hands</HI> to|wards him.</P>
<P>Thus the King expressed himself to the Parliament, desiring their assistance, assuring them he had no intention to alter the <HI>Government,</HI> though he wished the <HI>Laws</HI> might be rectified. But his <HI>King-craft</HI> (as he calls it) failed in striking at the <HI>Common Law,</HI> and he was convinced in it, how dangerous it was to give too much knowledg to the <HI>people</HI>; the two great <HI>Hammers</HI> of the <HI>State,</HI> the <HI>Church-man</HI> and <HI>Lawyer,</HI> that work the people to obedience, upon the two Anvils of <HI>Conscience</HI> and <HI>Policy,</HI> beat him to the understanding of it, so that ever after he joyned with them, and that three-fold Cord was not easily dissolved. But the times not being ripe yet to produce any thing but the fruits of <HI>obedience,</HI> they after this Lesson setled themselves to make divers good Laws, which they purchased at the rate of a Subsidie and a Fifteen.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Proclama|tion against new buildings.</NOTE>About this time, the <HI>Suburbs</HI> betwixt <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westminster,</HI> had many ruinous Piles of Building, which Age had worn out, and Industry, and Riches (the two great supporters of this <HI>mo|mentary Eternity</HI>) did strive to renew.

<P>This year 1609.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Siege of <HI>Iuliers.</HI></NOTE> begot a Truce betwixt the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and the Low Countries; yet by the <HI>death</HI> of the Duke of <HI>Cleve,</HI> the War was like to revive again: For while two petty <HI>Princes, Brandenburgh</HI> and <HI>Newburgh,</HI> strove for the inheritance, <HI>Spain,</HI> like the <HI>Vulture</HI> in the <HI>Fable,</HI> attempted to catch it from both, seizing upon <HI>Iuliers,</HI> one of the chief Strengths of the <HI>Country</HI>; which the States of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> by the help of our King, and <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth of <HI>France,</HI> besieged, and recovered a|gain. Sir Edward Cecil, Brother to the Earl of Salisburg, com|manded four thousand <HI>English</HI> at that Siege, whose Conduct gave Life to his Soldiers Valour, and that advanced the <HI>Glory</HI> of his <HI>Conduct.</HI> But where such fiery Spirits are congregated into a <HI>Body,</HI> there will be often violent and thundring <HI>eruptions.</HI> Sir <HI>Hatton Cheek</HI> was next Commander to Sir <HI>Edward Cecil,</HI> a Man of a gallant and daring <HI>courage</HI> in the difficultest enter|prises; who speaking to Sir <HI>Thomas Dutton</HI> (one of the Cap|tains

continued <HI>Tempest</HI> of <HI>fond Hopes,</HI> and built upon the Sand their vast desires, either old Age doth wash them quite away, or else some sudden <HI>storm</HI> makes them cast Anchor upon the shores of <HI>death,</HI> and there's an end. But one <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Providence</HI> is very re|markable towards him, as a Fore-runner of this ensuing <HI>mis|chief.</HI> When he came first to the Crown (which he (as it were) snatched out of the fire, the whole Kingdom being in a flame) he was a professed <HI>Protestant,</HI> so born, and so bred up: but finding himself in a <HI>tottering condition</HI> among his <HI>Popish</HI> Sub|jects, for his better <HI>security,</HI> he did something comply with them in <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> affairs, which gave great <HI>scandal</HI> to the <HI>Reformed,</HI> yet did not much advance him in the good opinion of their <HI>Opposites.</HI> For the <HI>Iesuits</HI> unconfident of him (inclining more to the <HI>hot zeal</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI>) one of their Instruments stab'd him into the <HI>mouth</HI> with a knife, without much hurt. Which done, an intimate of his, that came to visit him, told him plain|ly, that the Hand of <HI>God</HI> was much seen in this <HI>Action</HI>; for he had now denied the <HI>Truths</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> and the <HI>Religion</HI> he suckt in with his <HI>milk,</HI> but from the teeth <HI>outward,</HI> and therefore this punishment came to him as a warning: But let him take heed of denying it with his <HI>heart,</HI> for if he did, (it is to be feared) God would strike him there also: Both which were too much manifested. So suitable often are <HI>Gods Iudgments</HI> to our <HI>Sins</HI>!</P>
<P>The <HI>venom</HI> of this <HI>blow</HI> reached presently into <HI>England</HI>: and came somewhat near our Kings Heart; therefore he took the best way to prevent his Fears, by striving to prevent his Dan|gers, having no other <HI>end</HI> but his <HI>own.</HI> For when he considered the horridness of the <HI>Powder Plot,</HI> and by it the irreconcileable <HI>malice</HI> of that <HI>Party,</HI> he thought it the safest <HI>policy,</HI> not to stir those Ashes, where so much Fire was covered; which gave way to a flux of that <HI>Iesuitical humour</HI> to infest the Body of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>But now being startled with this poysoned knife,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Proclamati|on against Je|suits.</NOTE> he ventures upon a <HI>Proclamation,</HI> strictly commanding all <HI>Iesuits</HI> and <HI>Priests</HI> out of the Kingdom, and all <HI>Recusants</HI> to their own Houses, not to come within ten miles of the <HI>Court</HI>; and secures all the rest of his Subjects to him, by an universal taking of the Oath of <HI>Allegiance</HI>; which the <HI>Parliament,</HI> both <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Commons,</HI> (then sitting) began, and the rest of the People followed, to the Kings great contentment.</P>
<P>For the last <HI>Session</HI> the <HI>Parliament</HI> was prorogued till the six|teenth of <HI>October</HI> this year; and meeting now, they were wil|ling to secure their <HI>Allegiance</HI> to the King out of <HI>Piety</HI>; yet they were so stout (even in those youthful days, which he term'd <HI>Obstinacy</HI>) that they would not obey him in his incroachments upon the <HI>Publick Liberty,</HI> which he began then to practise. For
<PB N="52" REF="48">
being now season'd with seven years knowledg in his professi|on here, he thought he might set up for himself, and not be still <HI>journy-man</HI> to the <HI>lavish</HI> tongue of men, that pryed too narrowly into the <HI>secrets</HI> of his <HI>Prerogative,</HI> which are <HI>mysteries</HI> too high for them, being <HI>Arcana imperii,</HI> fitter to be admired than questioned: But the <HI>Parliament</HI> were apprehensive e|nough, that those hidden <HI>mysteries</HI> made many dark steps into the Peoples Liberties, and they were willing by the light of <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Reason,</HI> to discover what was the Kings, what theirs; Which the King unwilling to have searched into (after five <HI>Sessions</HI> in six years time) dissolved the <HI>Parliament</HI> by <HI>Procla|mation.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince <HI>Henry</HI> created Prince of <HI>Wales.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Prince Henry,</HI> the prime branch of this <HI>Royal Cedar,</HI> now growing Manly (being the sixteenth year of his <HI>Age</HI>) put forth himself in a more <HI>Heroick</HI> manner than was usual with <HI>Princes</HI> of his Time, by Tiltings, Barriers, and other exercises on horseback, the Martial Discipline of gentle <HI>Peace,</HI> which caught the peo|ples <HI>eyes,</HI> and made their <HI>tongues</HI> the Messengers of their <HI>hearts,</HI> in daily extolling his hopeful and gallant towardliness to ad|miration. And now the King thought him full of ripeness for the <HI>Honour</HI> of <HI>Knighthood</HI> (which admitted of a willing con|tribution from the people, and such old Customs as bring in mo|ney are never out of date) and (to add the more <HI>splendor</HI> to his sparkling youth) created him Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> (as he for|merly intimated to the Parliament) with all the <HI>pomp</HI> and <HI>solem|nity</HI> that a great King could express to a hopeful Son, his first born; or the <HI>merit</HI> of a Prince (that floated in the peoples af|fections) could possibly attain to. For as yet the King could discover nothing in him but that harmless and wanton inno|cency that commonly accompanies youth, being of a light <HI>nature,</HI> and soon blown away. But how far the Kings <HI>fears</HI> (like thick clouds) might afterwards blind the <HI>eye</HI> of his <HI>Rea|son,</HI> when he saw him (as he thought) too high mounted in the peoples <HI>love,</HI> and of an alluring <HI>spirit,</HI> to decline his pater|nal affection to him, and bring him to the <HI>low condition</HI> he fell in, may be the <HI>subject</HI> of my <HI>fears,</HI> not of my <HI>pen.</HI> With this Ingrandizing Title the King added a great Revenue, establish|ing also a full and splendent Retinue and Family to attend his person at St. <HI>Iames,</HI> now appointed to be the Princes Court, where this <HI>new Star</HI> placed in the <HI>third House,</HI> might be feared to <HI>culminate,</HI> and become <HI>Lord</HI> of the <HI>Ascendant</HI>: His <HI>Palace</HI> being as gloriously attended with young and sprightly Blossoms, as the Kings was with older, and more sage Plants. And now the King deliberates for a Wife for him, and sends to Sir <HI>Charles Cornwallis,</HI> his <HI>Lieger Ambassador</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> to treat with that King for his eldest Daughter.

The King strucken suddenly with such <HI>heaps,</HI> asked the Treasurer what this money was for; who told him, he had received his Majesties Commands to give so much to the Viscount <HI>Rochester.</HI> The King that either carelesly thought five thousand pound to be no more than the noise so much makes in <HI>Scotland</HI> (which doth not amount to above five hundred pounds) or, cunningly (if he knew the va|lue, knew also the Treasurers meaning) said it was too much for one man, and made him be contented with less than the half.</P>
<P>And now the King casts his thoughts towards <HI>Peterborough,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen of <HI>Scots</HI> transla|ted to <HI>Westmin|ster.</HI></NOTE> where his Mother lay, whom he caused to be translated to a Magnificent Tomb, at <HI>Westminster.</HI> And (somewhat suitable to her mind when she was living) she had a translucent passage in the night, through the City of <HI>London,</HI> by multitudes of Tor|ches: The Tapers placed by the Tomb and the Altar, in the <HI>Cathedral,</HI> smoaking with them like an <HI>Offertory,</HI> with all the <HI>Ceremonies,</HI> and <HI>Voices,</HI> their <HI>Quires</HI> and <HI>Copes</HI> could express, at|tended by many Prelates and Nobles, who payd this last Tri|bute to her <HI>memory.</HI> This was accounted a <HI>Piaculous action</HI> of the Kings by many, though some have not stuck to say, That as Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> was willing to be rid of the Queen of <HI>Scots,</HI> yet would not have it her <HI>action,</HI> and being it could not be done

without her command, when it was done she renounced her own <HI>act.</HI> So though the King was angry when he heard his Mother was taken away by a violent death, recalling his Am|bassador, threatning War, and making a great noise (which was after calmed and closed up with a large <HI>Pension</HI> from the Queen) yet he might well enough be pleased that such a <HI>spirit</HI> was layd, as might have conjured up three Kingdoms against him: For <HI>Patrick Grey</HI> that the King sent to disswade Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> from taking away his <HI>Mothers life,</HI> was the greatest <HI>In|strument</HI> to perswade her to it; Distilling always into her this Sentence, <HI>Mortua non mordet.</HI> When she is dead she cannot bite; But the Love that tends to <HI>self-preservation,</HI> is an ad|junct of Nature, more powerful than <HI>Filial duty,</HI> and therefore there will be no great strife where there are not adequate ope|rations,</P>

<P>About the same time,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rochester</HI> be|trays <HI>Overbury.</HI></NOTE> the King thinking fit to send an <HI>Am|bassador</HI> into <HI>Flanders,</HI> to the <HI>Arch-Duke</HI> (some say, into <HI>France</HI>) the Viscount recommended Sir <HI>Thomas Overbury</HI> to the King for that Service (extolling his abilities, and fitness for the same, publickly, that more notice might be taken of the affront) and the King made choice of him for that Imployment. Which done, the Viscount (under the shadow of <HI>friendship</HI>) imparts to <HI>Overbury</HI> what intentions the King had towards him; but he thought it would not be so convenient for him to accept of it, because he should not only lose his <HI>converse,</HI> and <HI>company,</HI> by such an alienation (which he highly valued) but many a fair <HI>opportunity</HI> of improving his <HI>respects</HI> to him, in some better way of advancement. <HI>Overbury</HI> had not been so little a <HI>Courtier,</HI> or a man of so mean Reason, but that he was sensible what <HI>dis|pleasure</HI> he should pull upon himself, by refusing the Kings Com|mands; And therefore he told the Viscount, that betwixt the Kings <HI>favours,</HI> and his <HI>friendship,</HI> he had a great <HI>conflict</HI> in his <HI>spi|rit,</HI> being willing to retain both; but how he should refuse the Kings commands with <HI>safety,</HI> he knew not.

<P>Now the Countess,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Countes|ses designs.</NOTE> like another <HI>Alecto,</HI> drove furiously, her <HI>Chariot</HI> having two wheels, which ran over all impediments: One was, to sue a <HI>Divorce</HI> betwixt her and her Husband, that she might marry the <HI>Viscount</HI>: The other was, to take away <HI>O|verbury,</HI> the blemish in her Eye, and that laid such a stain upon her, that nothing but his blood could expiate.

<P>For his <HI>Person,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Somersets</HI> in his life.</NOTE> He was rather well compacted than tall; his features and favour comely, and handsome, rather than <HI>beau|tiful</HI>; the hair of his head flaxen, that of his face tinctured with yellow, of the <HI>Sycambrian</HI> colour: In his own <HI>nature,</HI> of a gentle mind, and affable disposition, having publick <HI>affections,</HI> till they were all swallowed up in this <HI>gulf</HI> of <HI>beauty,</HI> which did precipitate him into these dangerous Contrivances. For that which made his <HI>friendship</HI> false, diverted his publick affection to his private interest; and when he found himself guilty of what he thought might ruin him, he grew covetous to heap that together, which he thought might preserve him; So that at one breach that our <HI>Corruptions</HI> make, many mischiefs fol|low in the crowd. And if he had not met with such a <HI>Woman,</HI> he might have been a good man: but trials, and strong temp|tations, enhanceth the Price of Vertue; the conflict is gallant, but to be overcome debaseth a man the more, by how much his fall is the greater.</P>

<Q><P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir <HI>Francis Bacons</HI> Speech in Star-chamber.</NOTE>THE Offence wherewith I shall charge the three Offen|ders at the Bar, is a misdemeanour of a high <HI>Nature,</HI> tending to the defacing and scandal of <HI>Iustice,</HI> in a great Cause Capital. The particular Charge is this:</P>
<P>the King among many of his <HI>Princely Vertues,</HI> is known to ex|cel in that proper <HI>Vertue</HI> of the Imperial Throne, which is <HI>Iu|stice</HI>; it is a <HI>Master Vertue,</HI> unto which the other three are mi|nistrant, and do service: <HI>Wisdom</HI> serveth to discover, and dis|cern of Innocencies, and Guiltiness; <HI>Fortitude</HI> is to persecute, and execute; and <HI>Temperance</HI> so to carry <HI>Iustice,</HI> as it be not passionate in the pursuit, nor confused in valuing Persons, nor precipitate in Time.</P>
<P>For this his Majesties <HI>Vertue</HI> of <HI>Iustice,</HI> God hath of late rai|sed an Occasion, and erected (as it were) a <HI>Stage,</HI> or <HI>Theatre,</HI> much for his <HI>Honour,</HI> to shew, and act it, in the pursuit of the violent untimely death of Sir <HI>Thomas Overbury,</HI> and therein cleansing the Land from blood. For if blood doth cry to Hea|ven in Gods ears, this is a stench, I may say, in the Nostrils of God and Man.</P>
<P>This work of <HI>Iustice,</HI> the greater and more excellent it is, you will soon conclude, the greater is the offence of any that have sought to affront or traduce it. And therefore, before I descend unto the particular Charge of these Offenders, I will say somewhat of the Crime of Impoysonment; somewhat of the particular Circumstances of this Fact upon <HI>Overbury</HI>; and thirdly, of the Kings great and worthy care and carriage in this business.</P>
<P>The offence of Impoysonment is most truly figured in that Device and Description which was made of the nature of <HI>Caius Caligula,</HI> That he was <HI>Lutum sanguine maceratum,</HI> Mire cemented with blood: For as it is one of the highest offences in guiltiness, so it is the basest of all others in the minds of Offenders. Treason, <HI>Magnum aliquid spectant,</HI> they aim at great things; but this is vile and base. I have found in the Book of God, examples of all other offences, but not any one of an Impoysonment, or an Impoysoner. I find mention of some fear of casual Impoysonments; when the Waters were corrupted and bitter, they came complaining in a fearful man|ner, Master, <HI>Mors in olla</HI>: And I find mention of Poysons of Beasts, and Serpents, <HI>The Poysons of Asps is under their lips,</HI> saith the <HI>Psalm,</HI> but I find no mention in a Human Creature, of a
<PB N="85" REF="77">
<HI>malicious</HI> and <HI>murtherous</HI> Impoysonment. <HI>Let their table be made a snare,</HI> is certainly most true of Impoysonment, but that I think was meant of the Treachery of Friends, that were par|ticipant of the same Table.</P><P>This is an offence that hath two <HI>spurs</HI> of <HI>offending, Spes per|ficiendi, &amp; spes celandi,</HI> it is easily committed and con|cealed. It is an <HI>offence,</HI> that is, <HI>Tanquam sagitta nocte volans,</HI> it is the Arrow that flies by night, it discerns not whom it hits: for many times the poyson is laid for one, and another takes it. As in <HI>Sanders</HI> case, where the poysoned Apple was laid for the Mother, and the Child eat it. And so in that notorious Case, whereupon the <HI>Statute</HI> of 22 <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. <HI>cap.</HI> 9. was made, where the intent being but to poyson one or two, poyson was put in a little Vessel of Barm that stood in the Kitchen at the Bishop of <HI>Rochesters</HI> house, of which Barm, Pottage or Grewel was made, wherewith seventeen of the Bishops Family were poy|soned, nay, divers of the poor that came to the Bishops-gate, and had the Pottage in Alms, were likewise poysoned. Here is great talk of Impoysonment, I hope I am safe, I have no ene|mies, nor any thing men can long for; that is all one; for he may sit at the Table by one, for whom poyson is prepared, and have a drench of his Cup or of his Pottage, and so (as the Poet saith) <HI>Concidit infelix alieno vulnere,</HI> he may die another mans death, and therefore it was most gravely, judiciously, and properly provided by that <HI>Statute,</HI> that Impoysonment should be High-Treason, because whatsoever offence tendeth to the utter subversion and dissolution of Human Society is in the nature of High-Treason,</P><P>But it is an offence, that I may truly say of it, <HI>Non est nostri generis nec sanguinis</HI>; It is, thanks be to God, rare in the Isle of <HI>Britain</HI>: It is neither of our Country, nor of our Church; You may find it in <HI>Rome,</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> there is a <HI>Religion</HI> for it, if it should come among us, it were better living in a Wilder|ness than in a Court.</P>
<P>For the <HI>particular fact</HI> upon <HI>Overbury</HI>; I knew the Gentle|man, it is true, his mind was great, but it moved not in any great good <HI>order,</HI> yet certainly it did commonly fly at good things; and the greatest fault that ever I heard by him, was, <HI>That he made his Friend his Idol.</HI> But take him as he was, the Kings Prisoner in the Tower, and then see how the Case stands. In that place the State is (as it were) a Respondent to make good the Body of the Prisoner, and if any thing hap|pen to him there, it may (though not in this Case, yet in some others) make an aspersion, and reflexion upon the State it self: For the person is utterly void of his own defence, his own care and providence can serve him to nothing; He is in the <HI>custody</HI> and <HI>preservation</HI> of <HI>Law,</HI> and we have a <HI>Maxim</HI>
<PB N="86" REF="78">
in our <HI>Law,</HI> that when a <HI>State</HI> is in <HI>preservation</HI> of <HI>Law,</HI> nothing can destroy it, or hurt it, and God forbid but the like should be in <HI>Persons,</HI> and therefore this was a <HI>circumstance</HI> of great <HI>ag|gravation.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, To have a man chased to death, in a manner, as it appears now by matter of <HI>Record</HI> (for other privacy of Cause I know not) by poyson after poyson: First <HI>Rosaker,</HI> then <HI>Ars|nick,</HI> then <HI>Mercury sublimate,</HI> then <HI>sublimate</HI> again, it is a thing would astonish mans nature to hear it. The <HI>Poets</HI> feign that the <HI>Furies</HI> had <HI>Whips,</HI> and that they were corded with poyson|ed <HI>Snakes</HI>; and a man would think that this <HI>subject</HI> were the very Case: To have a man tied to a <HI>post,</HI> and to scourge him to death with <HI>Serpents,</HI> for so truly may diversity of <HI>poysons</HI> be termed.</P>
<P>It pleased my Lord Chief Justice to let me know that which I heard with great <HI>comfort,</HI> which was the <HI>charge</HI> that his <HI>Ma|jesty</HI> gave to himself, and the rest of the Commissioners in this Case, worthy to be written in <HI>Letters</HI> of <HI>Gold,</HI> That the business should be carried without touch to any that was innocent, not only without impeachment, but without aspersion, which was a most <HI>Noble</HI> and <HI>Princely caution</HI>; for mens <HI>Reputations</HI> are tender things, and ought to be like <HI>Christs Coat</HI> without seam. And it was more to be respected in this Case, because it met with two great <HI>Persons</HI>; A <HI>Noble|man</HI> that his Majesty had favoured and advanced, and his <HI>Lady,</HI> being of a great and Honourable House, though I think it be true that the <HI>Writers</HI> say, that there is no <HI>Pomegranate</HI> so fair, or so sound, but may have a perished Kernel. Nay, I see plainly in those excellent Papers of his Majesties own hand|writing (as so many <HI>beams</HI> of <HI>Iustice</HI> issuing from that <HI>Vertue</HI> which so much doth shine in him) the business so evenly car|ried without <HI>prejudice,</HI> whether it were a true Accusation on the one part, or a practice or false Accusation on the other, as shewed plainly that his Majesties judgment was, <HI>Tanquam tabula rasa,</HI> as a clean pair of Tables, and his ears, <HI>Tanquam janua aperta,</HI> as a gate not side open, but wide open to the Truth, as it should be discovered. And I may truly affirm, that there was never in this Kingdom, nor in any other, the <HI>blood</HI> of a private Gentleman vindicated, <HI>Cum tanto motu Regni,</HI> or to say better, <HI>Cum tanto plausu Regni</HI>: If it had concerned the King or Prince there could not have been greater, or better Commi|ssioners. The term hath been almost turned into a <HI>Iustium,</HI> or <HI>Vacancy</HI>; the people being more willing to be lookers on in this business, than proceeders in their own. There hath been no care of discovery omitted, no moment of time lost; and therefore I will conclude, with the saying of <HI>Solomon,</HI> this part of my Speech, <HI>Gloria Deicelare rem, and gloria Regis scru|tari
<PB N="87" REF="78">
rem,</HI> It is the glory of God to conceal a thing, and it is the glory of the King to find it out. And his Majesties honor is the greater; for that he shewed to the World this business, as it hath relation to my Lord of <HI>Somerset</HI> (whose Case in no sort I do fore-judg, being ignorant of the secrets of the cause, but take him as the Law takes him, hitherto for a <HI>suspect</HI>) I say the King hath to his great honor shewed, That were any man in such a case of blood, as the Signet of his right-hand (as the Scripture saith) he would put him off.</P><P>Now will I come to the particular <HI>Charge</HI> of these Gentle|men And first I will by way of <HI>Narrative</HI> relate the <HI>Fact,</HI> with the occasion of it.</P>
<P>This wretched man <HI>Weston,</HI> who was the <HI>Actor,</HI> or <HI>Mechani|cal</HI> party in this Impoysonment, the first day being indicted by a very substantial <HI>Iury</HI> of selected <HI>Citizens,</HI> to the number of nineteen, who found <HI>Billa vera,</HI> yet nevertheless at the first stood mute. But after some days intermission, it pleased God to cast out the <HI>Dumb Devil,</HI> and he put himself upon his Trial, and was by a <HI>Iury</HI> of great value, upon his own <HI>Confessions,</HI> and other <HI>testimonies,</HI> found <HI>guilty</HI>: So as thirty and one sufficient <HI>Iurors</HI> have past upon him, and he had also his Judgment and Execution awarded. After this, being in preparation for an|other World, he sent for Sir <HI>Thomas Overbury</HI>'s Father, and falling down upon his knees, with great remorse and compun|ction asked him <HI>forgiveness</HI>; and afterwards again of his own <HI>motion,</HI> desired to have his like prayer of <HI>forgiveness</HI> recommen|ded to his Mother, who was absent. And at both times out of the abundance of his heart confessed that he was to die <HI>just|ly,</HI> and that he was worthy of death. And after again at his Execution (which is a kind of sealing time of <HI>Confessions</HI>) even at the point of death (though there were <HI>Tempers</HI> about him he did again confirm publickly, that his Examinations were true, and that he had been justly and honourably dealt with. So here is a period of this man, which was the subject of this calumny or affront of <HI>Iustice.</HI> Wherein Mr. <HI>Lumsden</HI> plays his part first, who in the time between <HI>Westons</HI> standing <HI>mute</HI> and his <HI>Tryal,</HI> frames a most odious and libellous <HI>Relation,</HI> contain|ing as many untruths as lines, sets it down in writing with his own hand, and delivers it to one of the <HI>Bedchamber</HI> to be put into the Kings hands, falsifying all that was done the first day of <HI>Westons</HI> Arraignment, turning the pike and point of his im|putations upon the Lord Chief Justice of <HI>England,</HI> whose name thus occurring, I cannot pass by, and yet I cannot skill of this same <HI>Flattery,</HI> or <HI>vulgar Attribute</HI>; but this I will say of him, and I would say as much to <HI>Ages, That never mans person and his place were better met in a business, than my Lord</HI> Cook, <HI>and my Lord Chief Iustice, in the Cause of</HI> Overbury.</P><P><PB N="88" REF="79">Now for the person of Master <HI>Lumsden,</HI> I know he is a <HI>Scotch</HI> Gentleman, and thereby more ignorant of our <HI>Laws:</HI> but I cannot tell whether this doth extenuate his fault, or in|crease it; for as it may extenuate it in respect of <HI>ignorance,</HI> so it doth aggravate it much in respect of <HI>presumption,</HI> to meddle in that he understood not, unless some other mans cunning wrought upon this mans boldness. The infusion of a <HI>slander</HI> into a Kings ear, is of all forms of <HI>Libels,</HI> and <HI>Slanders,</HI> the worst. It is true, that Kings may keep secret their <HI>informa|tion,</HI> and then no man can enquire after them, while they are shrined in their <HI>Breast</HI>: but where a King is pleased that a man shall answer for his false information, divers precedents of slanderous <HI>Petitions</HI> have been as severly punished, as slan|derous <HI>Libels.</HI></P>
<P>For the Offence of Sir <HI>Iohn Wentworth,</HI> and Sir <HI>Iohn Hollis,</HI> which was, to scandalize the <HI>Iustice</HI> already past, or to cut off the thread of something that is to come, these two Gentle|men came mounted on Horseback, and in a ruffling and fa|cing manner, presumed to Examin <HI>Weston,</HI> whether he did poyson <HI>Overbury,</HI> or no; directly cross to that which had been tried, and judged. For what was the Point tried? That <HI>Weston</HI> had poysoned <HI>Overbury</HI>: And Sir <HI>Iohn Went|worth</HI>'s question was, whether he did poyson him? A direct Contradictory. Whereupon <HI>Weston</HI> answered, that he did him wrong; and turning to the Sheriff, said, <HI>You promised me I should not be troubled at this time</HI>; and yet nevertheless <HI>Wentworth</HI> prest him to answer, that he might pray with him. l know not that Sir <HI>Iohn Wentworth</HI> is an <HI>Ecclesiastick,</HI> that he should cut any man from communion of Prayer; and for all this vexing of the spirit of a poor man, now in the gate of <HI>death, Weston</HI> stood constant, and said, <HI>I die not unworthily, my Lord Chief Iustice hath my mind under his hand, and he is an honourable and just Iudg.</HI> Sir <HI>Iohn Hollis</HI> was not so much a Questionist, but wrought upon the other Questions, and like a Counsellor, wisht him to discharge his Conscience, and to satisfie the World: What World I marvel! It was the World at <HI>Tyburn</HI>: For the World at <HI>Guildhall,</HI> and the World at <HI>London,</HI> were satisfied before; <HI>Teste</HI> the Bels that rang e|very where. But men have got a fashion now a-days, that two or three busie bodies will take upon them the name of the World, and broach their own <HI>conceit,</HI> as if it were a general <HI>opinion.</HI> Well, what more? When they could not work up|on <HI>Weston,</HI> Sir <HI>Iohn Hollis</HI> in an indignation, turned about his <HI>horse,</HI> as the other was turning to his <HI>death,</HI> and said he was sorry of such a <HI>Conclusion.</HI> That was to have the State honou|red or justified.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="79">Sir <HI>Iohn Hollis</HI> offence hath another <HI>Appendix,</HI> before this in time, which was at the day of the Tryal. He presumed to give his <HI>Verdict</HI> openly, That if he were of the <HI>Iury</HI> he would not doubt what to do. Marry he saith he cannot well tell whe|ther he spoke this before the <HI>Iury</HI> had given up their <HI>Verdict</HI> or after. Wherein there is little gained; for whether he were a <HI>Praejuror,</HI> or a <HI>Postjuror,</HI> the one was to prejudice the <HI>Iury,</HI> the other was to attaint them.</P><P>The offence of these Gentlemen is greater and more dan|gerous than is conceived. We have no <HI>Spanish Inquisition,</HI> no <HI>Iustice</HI> in a corner, no gagging of mens mouths at their death, but they may speak freely to the last; but then it must come from the free motion of the <HI>party,</HI> not by tempting of <HI>Questi|ons.</HI> The Questions that are asked ought to tend to further re|vealing of their own, or others guiltiness: But to use a Que|stion in the nature of a cross interrogatory, to falsifie that which is <HI>Res judicata,</HI> is intolerable. That were to erect a <HI>Court,</HI> or Commission of <HI>review</HI> at <HI>Tyburn,</HI> against the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Westminster</HI>: For if the Answer be according to the Judgment past, it adds credit to <HI>Iustice</HI>; if it be contrary, it derogateth nothing, yet it subjecteth the <HI>Majesty</HI> of <HI>Iustice</HI> to a popular vulgar <HI>talk</HI> and <HI>opinion.</HI> My Lords, these are great and dan|gerous offences; for if we do not maintain <HI>Iustice, Iustice</HI> will not maintain us.</P></Q>

<P>Sir <HI>Thomas Monson,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir <HI>Thomas Monson</HI> ar|raigned.</NOTE> another of the Countesses <HI>Agents</HI> in this poysoning contrivance, had past one days Tryal at <HI>Guildhall.</HI> But the Lord Chief Justice <HI>Cook</HI> in his <HI>Rhetorical Flourishes</HI> at his Arraignment, vented some expressions (which he either de|duced from <HI>Northamptons</HI> assuring the Lieutenant of the Tower, that the making away of Sir <HI>Thomas Overbury</HI> would be accep|table to the King, or from some other secret hint received) as if he could discover more than the <HI>death</HI> of a private person, in|timating, though not plainly, that <HI>Overburies</HI> untimely remove had something in it of retaliation, as if he had been guilty of the same Crime against Prince <HI>Henry,</HI> blessing himself with ad|miration at the <HI>horror</HI> of such <HI>actions.</HI> In which he flew so high a pitch, that he was taken down by a <HI>Court Lure,</HI> Sir <HI>Tho|mas Monsons</HI> Tryal laid aside, and he soon after set at li|berty, and the Lord Chief Justices wings were clipt for it ever after.</P>
<P>And it was rumor'd, that the King (heightned to so much <HI>passion</HI> by this <HI>eruption</HI> of Sir <HI>Edward Cooks</HI>) went to the Coun|cil Table, and kneeling down there, desired <HI>God to lay a Curse</HI>

<P>There had been in Prince <HI>Henries</HI> time a Treaty of <HI>Marriage</HI> betwixt him and a Daughter of <HI>Spain,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King think of a match for his Son Prince <HI>Charles.</HI></NOTE> which took no effect. Our King was real in his intentions, not willing to have his <HI>Sons Beams</HI> to display themselves but in a <HI>Royal Horizon.</HI> The <HI>Spanish policy</HI> clouded the <HI>business</HI> with <HI>delays,</HI> whether from the old <HI>grudg</HI> that was betwixt Queen <HI>Katharine</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, or the difference between the <HI>Nations</HI> in <HI>Religion</HI>? But the <HI>Spanish Courtesie</HI> being loth directly and point blank to tell our King, he liked not the <HI>Conjunction,</HI> went with a slow-pa|ced <HI>Gravity,</HI> such as he thought befitted the <HI>Civility</HI> of Prin|ces,
<PB N="92" REF="82">
and gave a little light to hope that it might be accomplish|ed. But <HI>Salisbury</HI> and others that managed those great affairs then, did at this <HI>chink</HI> discover, that their <HI>formalities</HI> were but <HI>Spanish Complements,</HI> which like the <HI>air</HI> that gave them <HI>being,</HI> soon vanished away. After this our Kings thoughts cast about, how he might provide a fit <HI>match</HI> for Prince <HI>Charles,</HI> who shined in the same <HI>sphere</HI> of <HI>Honor</HI> (that his Brother left for a <HI>better</HI>) but not so much inlightned with the peoples <HI>love,</HI> being less <HI>active</HI> and <HI>splendid,</HI> and (that I may not call it <HI>sullenness</HI>) more <HI>reserved.</HI> The <HI>German Dames</HI> were discoursed on (where his Sister shined in her Glory) as being of the same <HI>Religion,</HI> and more suitable in <HI>Christian Policy</HI>; but they were (in a manner) <HI>Subjects</HI> to the Emperor, and that would give an allay to the <HI>Super-elementary</HI> extraction of Kings, which should be of a high|er <HI>Origine,</HI> to amuse, and that they might be the more admired by their people, and therefore not so fitting in <HI>State-Policy.</HI> And seeing there were small hopes expected from <HI>Spain,</HI> a Daugh|ter to <HI>Henry</HI> the great, late King of <HI>France,</HI> was aimed at, and Sir <HI>Thomas Edmonds,</HI> our Kings Lieger Ambassador, had (long before this time) made his little addresses, superficially, and founded the Chanel, but he met some <HI>Rocks</HI> and <HI>Remoras</HI> in the way, so that he could not discover clearly their intentions; and the King was loth to express himself plainly, lest he should receive an affront. And now sending (as he thought it ci|villy necessary) an Extraordinary Ambassador to congratulate the King of <HI>France</HI> his <HI>Marriage</HI> with <HI>Anna</HI> the <HI>Infanta</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> he thought it good <HI>policy</HI> to take this <HI>occasion</HI> to make a stricter <HI>scrutiny</HI> whether there were any ground to rest upon for match|ing his Son.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lord <HI>Hays</HI> sent in|to <HI>France.</HI></NOTE> And who is fitter for that employment, being only for <HI>Court|ship</HI> and <HI>Bravery,</HI> than the Lord <HI>Hayes,</HI> a Gentleman whose <HI>Composition</HI> of <HI>mind</HI> tended that way? He was born in <HI>Scotland,</HI> where <HI>bravery</HI> was in no <HI>superfluity,</HI> bred up in <HI>France,</HI> where he could not have it in <HI>extravagancy,</HI> but he found it in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and made it his <HI>vanity.</HI> The King had a large <HI>hand,</HI> and he had a large <HI>heart,</HI> and though he were no great <HI>Favourite</HI> e|ver, yet he was never but in <HI>favour.</HI> He with a great Train of young Noblemen, and other <HI>Courtiers</HI> of eminency, suited themselves with all those <HI>ornaments</HI> that could give <HI>lustre</HI> to so dazelling an appearance as <HI>Love,</HI> and the <HI>Congratulation</HI> of it car|ried with it. All the study was, who should be most glorious, and he had the happiest <HI>fancy,</HI> whose invention could express something <HI>Novel,</HI> neat and unusual, that others might admire. So that <HI>Huntingtons Prophecy</HI> was fulfilled here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6 <HI>lib. H. Hunt.</HI></NOTE> when speaking of the time of the <HI>Scots</HI> Conquest of <HI>England,</HI> he said, <HI>Multimo|da variatione vestium &amp; indumentorum designaretur.</HI> I remem|ber I saw one of the Lord Ambassadors Suits (and pardon me
<PB N="93" REF="82">
that I take notice of such petty things) the Cloak and Hose were made of very fine white Beaver, imbroidered richly all over with Gold and Silver; the Cloak, almost to the Cape, within and without, having no lining but imbroidery, The Doublet was Cloth of Gold,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lord <HI>Hayes</HI> rides in state to the Court.</NOTE> imbroidered so thick, that it could not be discerned, and a white Beaver-hat suitable, Brim|full of imbroidery, both above and below. This is presented as an <HI>Essay,</HI> for one of the meanest he wore, so that if this Rela|tion should last longer than his <HI>old cloaths,</HI> the Reader might well think it a <HI>Romance,</HI> favouring rather of <HI>Fancy</HI> than <HI>Re|ality.</HI></P>
<P>But this kind of <HI>Vanity</HI> had been long <HI>active</HI> in <HI>England</HI>: For the last Parliament it was moved by some well-affected to <HI>Re|formation</HI> of the <HI>Abuses</HI> of excess in <HI>Apparel,</HI> that there might be a <HI>Regulation</HI> of this kind of <HI>Gallantry,</HI> to the distinguishing of men one from another; For (it was said) some of means <HI>Fortunes</HI> wore <HI>Garments</HI> fitter for <HI>Princes</HI> than <HI>Subjects</HI>; and many <HI>Gentry</HI> of antient descent had wasted, and impoverished themselves and their Posterities with this <HI>extravagancy,</HI> so that it was very requisite to give some stop to this redundant <HI>humor.</HI> To which was answered, That if those of <HI>mean Fortunes</HI> went so richly attired, and came not honestly by their <HI>ornaments,</HI> they would be quickly found out, and there were good Laws enough for such Transgressors. But as there is no perpetuity of <HI>Being</HI> on <HI>Earth,</HI> so there is a continual <HI>vicissitude</HI> and <HI>revolution</HI> in all <HI>sub|lunary</HI> things, some are advanced, and some decline, <HI>God pulleth down one, and setteth up another.</HI> If any Noble, or antiently de|scended Family will be so mad and foolish to beggar themselves and their Posterities with this, or any other excess, 'tis very probable that some man of more wisdom and merit will injoy that which the other hath so idlely and prodigally mispent; for to set such limitations will damp the spirits of Industry. So the motion was declined.</P>
<P>But to return to the Lord <HI>Hayes.</HI> Thus accoutred and accom|plished, he went into <HI>France,</HI> and a day for <HI>Audience</HI> being pre|fixed, all the argument and dispute betwixt him and his gal|lant Train (which took up some time) was, how they should go to the <HI>Court, Coaches,</HI> like <HI>Curtains,</HI> would eclipse their <HI>splen|dor</HI>; riding on horsback in Boots, would make them look like <HI>Travellers,</HI> not <HI>Courtiers</HI>; and not having all Foot-cloaths it would be an unsuitable mixture: Those that brought rich trap|pings for their Horses, were willing to have them seen, so it was concluded for the Foot-cloth, and those that have none (to their bitter cost) must furnish themselves. This prepara|tion begot expectation, and that filled all the Windows, Bal|cones, and Streets of <HI>Paris</HI> as they passed with a multitude of Spectators, Six Trumpeters, and two Marshals (in Tawny
<PB N="94" REF="83">
Velvet Liveries, compleatly Suited, laced all over with Gold, richly, and closely laid) led the way; the Ambassador follow|ed with a great Train of Pages and Footmen in the same rich Livery, incircling his Horse, and the rest of his Retinue accor|ding to their Qualities and Degrees, in as much bravery as they could devise, or procure, followed in couples, to the wonder|ment of the beholders. And some said (how truly I cannot assert) the Ambassadors Horse was shod with Silver-shooes, lightly tackt on; and when he came to a place where <HI>Persons,</HI> or <HI>Beauties</HI> of eminency were, his very Horse prancing, and curveting, in humble <HI>reverence</HI> flung his shooes away, which the greedy understanders scrambled for, and he was content to be gazed on, and admired, till a <HI>Farrier,</HI> or rather the <HI>Argentier</HI> in one of his rich Liveries, among his train of Footmen, out of a Tawny Velvet bag took others, and tackt them on, which lasted till he came to the next troop of <HI>Grandies</HI>: And thus with much ado he reached the <HI>Louure.</HI></P>
<P>All Complements and outward Ceremonies of State being performed, the Lord Ambassador made his business known by more private addresses, which in appearance was well resented, but indeed not intended, and came to no effect: For the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> had anticipated the young Ladies affection for the Prince of <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">emont</HI> his Son. The <HI>Savoyan Agents</HI> bringing more Gold in their hands than on their backs, had so smoothed the way, that not only those about the Princess, but the great ones themselves were made workers for him. After the Am|bassador had been feasted magnificently, with all his gallant Train, in several places, to shew the <HI>Grandure</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> he came over into <HI>England,</HI> and practised it here, making many times upon several <HI>occasions</HI> such <HI>stupendious Feasts,</HI> and heaped <HI>Banquets,</HI> as if all the <HI>Creatures</HI> had contributed to his excess. I know not what limits or bounds are set to the <HI>glories</HI> of Princes Courts, or Nobles minds. We see the Sea it self, and all his tributary Rivers, do ebb and flow, but if they swell so high, to overflow that Bank, that <HI>Reason</HI> hath prescribed to keep them in, what Inundations of sad mischief follow, <HI>Experience</HI> shews.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Breach be|twixt the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice.</NOTE>A little before this time there was a breach between the Lord Chief Justice <HI>Cook,</HI> and the Lord Chancellor <HI>Ellesmer,</HI> which made a passage to both their declines.

This <HI>Witness</HI> is called for as the prop of the Cause, the Under|taker answers upon Oath, <HI>He left him in such a condition, that if he continues in it but a quarter of an hour, he is a dead man.</HI> This evidencing the mans incapability to come, deaded the mat|ter so, that it lost the Cause. The <HI>Plantiffs</HI> that had the Injury bring the business about in <HI>Chancery</HI>: The <HI>Defendants</HI> (having had Judgment at Common Law) refuse to obey the Orders of that Court, whereupon the Lord Chancellor for contempt of the Court commits them to prison. They petition against him in the <HI>Star-Chamber,</HI> the Lord Chief Justice joyns with them, foments the difference, threatning the Lord Chancellor with a <HI>Premunire.</HI> The Chancellor makes the King acquainted with the business, who sent to Sir <HI>Francis Bacon</HI> his Attorny General, Sir <HI>Henry Montague,</HI> and Sir <HI>Randolph Crew</HI> his Serjeants at <HI>Law,</HI> and Sir <HI>Henry Yelverton</HI> his Sollicitor, commanding them to search what <HI>Presidents</HI> there have been of late years, wherein such as complained in <HI>Chancery</HI> were relieved according to Equi|ty and Conscience, after judgment at Common Law. These being men well versed in their <HI>Profession</HI> (after canvassing the matter throughly) returned answer to the King, That there hath been a strong <HI>current</HI> of <HI>Practice</HI> and <HI>proceeding</HI> in <HI>Chancery,</HI> after <HI>Iudgment</HI> at <HI>Common Law,</HI> and many times after <HI>Executi|on,</HI> continued since <HI>Henry</HI> the sevenths time, to the Lord Chan|cellor that now is, both in the Reigns (<HI>seriatim</HI>) of the several Kings, and the times of the several Chancellors, whereof di|vers were great learned men in the <HI>Law</HI>; It being in Cases where there is no <HI>Remedy</HI> for the <HI>Subject</HI> by the strict course of the <HI>Common Law</HI> unto which the <HI>Iudges</HI> are sworn. This satisfied the King, justified the Lord Chancellor, and the Chief Justice received the foil: Which was a bitter <HI>potion</HI> to his <HI>spirit,</HI> but not strong enough to work on him as his <HI>Enemies</HI> wished.</P>
<P>Therefore to humble him more,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chief Ju|stice is hum|bled.</NOTE> he is brought on his knees at the Council Table, and three other <HI>Ingredients</HI> added to the <HI>Dose,</HI> of a more <HI>active operation.</HI></P>
<P>First, He is charged, That when he was the Kings Attor|ney, in the beginning of his Reign, he concealed a <HI>Statute</HI> of twelve thousand pounds, due to the King from the late Lord Chancellor <HI>Hatton,</HI> wherein he deceived the <HI>trust</HI> reposed in him.</P>
<P>Secondly, That he uttered words of very high <HI>contempt</HI> as he sate in the seat of <HI>Iustice,</HI> saying the <HI>Common Law</HI> of <HI>England</HI> would be overthrown, and the light of it obscured, reflecting upon the King. And thirdly, His uncivil and indiscreet <HI>carriage</HI> before His Majesty (being assisted by his Privy Council and Judges) in the Case of <HI>Commendams.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="86">The last he contest, and humbly craved his Majesties <HI>Pardon.</HI> The other two he palliated with some colourable excuses, which were not so well set off, but they left such a tincture be|hind that he was commanded to a private life. And to expiate the Kings anger, he was injoyned in that leisurely retirement to review his Books of <HI>Reports,</HI> which the King was informed had many extravagant <HI>opinions,</HI> published for positive and good Law, which must be corrected, and brought to his <HI>Majesty</HI> to be perused. But the Title of the Books wherein he stiles him|self <HI>Lord Chief Iustice of England,</HI> was to be expunged, being but <HI>Lord Chief Iustice of the Kings Bench.</HI> And at his departure from the <HI>Council Table</HI> (where he humbly acknowledged his Maje|sties <HI>mercy,</HI> and their Lordships <HI>justice</HI>) the <HI>Lord Treasurer</HI> gave him a <HI>wipe,</HI> for suffering his Coachman to ride bare before him in the <HI>streets</HI>; which fault he strove to cover, by telling his Lordship, his Coachman did it for his own ease. But not long after the <HI>Lord Treasurer</HI> came under his <HI>lash</HI> in the <HI>Star-Chamber,</HI> and he requited him for it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Faults.</NOTE>While he was under this <HI>Clond,</HI> all his faults were ripped up, either by his Enemies, or his Well-wishers, who advise him to be humbled for this Visitation. That <HI>Affliction</HI> only <HI>levels</HI> the <HI>mole-hils</HI> of <HI>pride</HI> in us, <HI>plows</HI> up the <HI>heart,</HI> and makes it fit for <HI>Wisdom</HI> to <HI>sow</HI> her <HI>seed,</HI> and <HI>Grace</HI> to bring forth her <HI>in|crease.</HI> That he delighted to speak much, which becomes a <HI>Pleader,</HI> and not a <HI>Iudg</HI>; for so his <HI>affections</HI> were entangled with a liking of his own <HI>arguments,</HI> and an undervaluing of others; when having a large and fruitful mind, he should not labour so much what to speak, as what to leave unspoken. <HI>Such lusty soyls are often to be weeded</HI>! That he was wont to praise, and dispraise, upon slight grounds, the same man, and that sometimes suddenly, so that his <HI>reproofs,</HI> or <HI>commendati|ons,</HI> are neglected and contemned; when as the <HI>censure</HI> of a <HI>Iudg</HI> (coming slowly, but surely) should be a <HI>brand</HI> to the <HI>guilty,</HI> and a <HI>crown</HI> to the <HI>vertuous.</HI> That he will jest at any man in publick, without respect of the Persons dignity, or his own; which disgraceth his <HI>gravity,</HI> more than it can ad|vance the opinion of his <HI>wit.</HI> That he makes the Law to lean a little too much to his own <HI>opinion,</HI> whereby he shews himself a <HI>legal Tyrant,</HI> striking with that Weapon whom he pleases, being able to turn the edg any way.

for he stopt the Confessions and Accusations of some, that would have spoken enough to remove more <HI>stumbling blocks</HI> out of his way; and yet he did not this in <HI>favour</HI> of any, but out of present unadvised <HI>humour,</HI> supposing enough behind to discover all; which fell not out so: And therefore, though he were to be commended for what he did, yet he is to be re|prehended for many Circumstances in the doing; and these are now briers in his sides, and thorns in his eyes. Much more, to this purpose, was written to him, and vented against him.</P>
<P>Truly he was a Man of excellent <HI>parts,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">And short Character.</NOTE> but not without his <HI>frailties</HI>: for as he was a <HI>Storehouse</HI> and <HI>Magazine</HI> of the <HI>Common Law,</HI> for the present times; and laid such Foundation for the future, that <HI>Posterity</HI> may for ever build on; So his <HI>passions</HI> and <HI>pride</HI> so were predominant, that boyling over, he lost (by them) much of his own <HI>fulness,</HI> which extinguished not only the <HI>valuation,</HI> but <HI>respect</HI> to his <HI>merit: So often is that heat, that gives life to noble Parts, by a circular motion, the ruin of them</HI>! Yet to cool his <HI>distemper,</HI> and to bring him to himself, he is within a short time called to the <HI>Council Table,</HI> the <HI>King</HI> being loth to lose his <HI>abilities.</HI></P>
<P>The Lord Chancellor <HI>Ellesmer</HI> also about this time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lord Chancellor retires.</NOTE> weary of his publick imployment, and weakned with <HI>age,</HI> desired the Kings leave to retire, that he might make use of the short time left him, to cast up his accounts for another World: The King gave the <HI>Seal,</HI> and the place of Lord Chancellor, to Sir <HI>Francis Bacon,</HI> his Attorney Ceneral; and the old Lord <HI>Ellesmer</HI> wore out the remnant of his life in quiet, dying in a good old age. and full of <HI>virtuous</HI> fame, leaving a Noble <HI>Posterity,</HI> who enjoy a great Estate with the Title of Earl of <HI>Bridgwater.</HI></P>
<P>Time and Age had also worn out Sir <HI>Ralph Winwood,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir <HI>Ralph Win|wood</HI> dies.</NOTE> the Kings able, faithful, and honest Servant, and Secretary; who dying, Sir <HI>Robert Nanton,</HI> and Sir <HI>George Calvert,</HI> were made Secretaries; men of contrary <HI>Religions,</HI> and <HI>Factions</HI> (as they were then sti|led) <HI>Calvert</HI> being an <HI>Hispaniolized Papist</HI>: the King matching them together, like contrary <HI>Elements,</HI> to find a <HI>medium</HI> betwixt them.</P>
<P>But the greatest remove was the Lord Treasurers staff,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lord Treasurer questioned in Star-Cham|ber.</NOTE> which was broken by <HI>Somersets</HI> fall, the way being now made plain, and laid open, that discovered the <HI>Treasurers</HI> imperfecti|ons, and his <HI>Wives</HI> corruptions: The Lady keeping the <HI>Shop,</HI> and Sir <HI>Iohn Binglie,</HI> her Officer, crying, <HI>What d'ye lack</HI>? as the new Lord Chancellor <HI>Bacon</HI> was pleased to express himself in the <HI>Star-Chamber</HI>; whither the <HI>business</HI> being brought, the <HI>sore</HI> was open'd, and all the bad <HI>humours</HI> flow to the ill-affected part. <HI>Bribery</HI> and <HI>Extortion</HI> is the <HI>matter</HI> that appears, which is squeez'd out, and aggravated by Sir <HI>Edward Cook,</HI> (newly
<PB N="98" REF="88">
perkt up, such is the Worlds bucket!) who very learnedly ci|ted many <HI>Precedents</HI> of <HI>Treasurers</HI> in former Kings Reigns, that miscarried, and their several <HI>punishments.</HI></P>
<P>He begins with <HI>Randulphus de Britton,</HI> Treasurer to King <HI>Hen|ry</HI> the third, who had mis-imployed the Kings Treasure, decei|ved the King in his Office, for which he was questioned, his Lands and Goods seized into the Kings hands, and sent prisoner to the Tower, where he submitted himself to the King, confest his fault, gave up his place, <HI>&amp; pro Gratia habenda</HI> (saith the <HI>Re|cord</HI>) obtained Restitution of his Goods and Lands, paying only three thousand pounds Fine. This was a piece of <HI>Wisdom</HI> (saith he) as well as <HI>Humility</HI>; alluding to the present Lord Treasu|rers stout heart that would not submit.</P>
<P>The second was <HI>Petrus de Rivallis,</HI> who was Treasurer of <HI>Ire|land,</HI> and Chamberlain of <HI>England</HI> in <HI>Edward</HI> the firsts time, who had taken <HI>Bribes</HI> in his Office, <HI>Tam de Religiosis, quam de Laicis.</HI> Of which being convicted, he lost his place, and was put to his Fine and Ransom.</P>
<P>And in the same Kings Reign, The Abbot of <HI>Westminster,</HI> and his <HI>virtuous Monks,</HI> took out of the Kings Treasure at <HI>Westmin|ster</HI> many thousand pounds, <HI>Ad inastimabile damnum Regis &amp; Reg|ni.</HI> The Abbot being sent to the Tower, and the Monks disposed to several prisons, and notwithstanding they pleaded <HI>Priviledg of Clergy-men</HI> for their Tryal, yet in the Case of imbezelling the Kings Treasure, they had no <HI>Priviledg,</HI> but the <HI>Temporalities</HI> of the Abby were seized for <HI>satisfaction.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cov. &amp; Lichf.</HI></NOTE> In King <HI>Edward</HI> the seconds time, <HI>Walter de Langton,</HI> a Bishop, was Treasurer to the King; He did take of the Earl of <HI>Montealto</HI> to be a friend to him (<HI>in agendis negotiis versus dominum Regem</HI>) a hundred pounds (the said Earl being a prisoner) to let him go free to do his business. And this was given, as the Record speaks, <HI>De spontanea voluntate,</HI> for a Gratuity, <HI>&amp; ex curialitate sua,</HI> for his courtesie, yet this was adjudged <HI>Extortion</HI> and <HI>Bribe|ry.</HI> Again, <HI>Iohn de Engam</HI> was indicted of <HI>Trespass</HI> by this Bi|shop for the Mannor of <HI>Fisbie,</HI> whereunto the King pretended <HI>Title,</HI> and was by the Bishop imprisoned for the <HI>Trespass.</HI> But afterwards another Mannor was conveyed to this Bishop, <HI>ob diversas curialitates,</HI> for <HI>courtesies</HI> that he had done, and so <HI>En|gam</HI> was discharged of his Indictment, and though that the Bi|shop pleaded, that <HI>Voluntas Regis potius ad imprisonamentam quam ad sinem,</HI> because it was the Kings pleasure rather to pu|nish by Imprisonment than Fine, yet this was adjudged <HI>Bribe|ry.</HI> Again, the Bayliff of <HI>Oxford</HI> was committed for Arrera|ges of a hundred pounds in his Account, and thereupon the Mannor of <HI>Calcot</HI> was conveyed unto the Bishop, and the Bishop of his pure devotion did discharge him of that Imprisonment. But these were Pleas and Flourishes of guilty men, as the Re|cord
<PB N="99" REF="88">
saith, but they were all three judged <HI>Extortion</HI> and <HI>Bribery</HI>; and for these the Bishop was put from his place, fined, and committed to the Tower.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> Lord <HI>Latimer,</HI> in <HI>Edward</HI> the thirds time, being ap|pointed to pay the Kings debts, did buy in some of them at <HI>lower</HI> rates than was due, as eighty pounds for a hundred, and thirty pounds for forty; By which course he made the King a <HI>Bankrupt Compounder,</HI> and for this he was fined, and lost all his Offices.</P>
<P>In like case was the Lord <HI>Nevil,</HI> who was trusted to pay the Army, but he bought the debt of them, and justified, that they gave him the remainder of their free gift, but for this he was fined, and committed to the Tower.</P>
<P>These, and many other precedents and examples, armed with Authority and Antiquity, were mustered up, and the Lord Treasurers miscarriages exasperated, especially for embezelling those Moneys the King lately received of the State of the <HI>Ne|therlands</HI> for the redemption of the <HI>cautionary</HI> Towns, <HI>Flushing,</HI> and <HI>Brill,</HI> which the King was forced to relinquish again to the States, because he had no money to pay the Soldiers there; and that money being designed for the <HI>lrish</HI> Army (which was also in great Want) it was thought the more heinous, and a double miscarriage, being it was so dearly bought, and so unduly spent. But the Earl himself being a man of a noble disposition (though too indulgent to his too active Wife) had retained the Kings favour, if he had taken Sir <HI>Edward Cooks</HI> counsel, and submitted and not strove to justifie his own integrity, which he maintain|ed with a great deal of confidence, till it was too late, for then his <HI>submission</HI> did him little good. But his Wives faults being imputed to him, he was fined thirty thousand pounds, and im|prisonment in the Tower; Sir <HI>Iohn Bingly</HI> fined two thousand pounds, and imprisonment in the Fleet: For it was thought the Lord and Lady could not have found the way into these ob|scure, low, and dark contrivances, without the <HI>light</HI> of his help. Which <HI>Sentence</HI> was pronounced by the Lord Chancellor <HI>Bacon,</HI> who though he were of transcendent parts, yet was he tainted with the same infection, and not many years after perished in his own <HI>corruption</HI>; which shews, That neither <HI>Example</HI> nor <HI>Pre|cept</HI> (he having seen so many, and been made capable of so much) can be a <HI>Pilot</HI> sufficient to any <HI>Port</HI> of <HI>Happiness</HI> (though <HI>Reason</HI> be never so able to direct) if <HI>Grace</HI> doth not give the <HI>gate.</HI></P>
<P>But the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King comes to the Star-Cham|ber.</NOTE> more to exalt <HI>Iustice,</HI> and to shew the people, his high abilities, came in <HI>Iune</HI> this year to the <HI>Star-Chamber,</HI> where in a long, and well-weighed <HI>Discourse,</HI> he turns over the <HI>volume</HI> of his <HI>mind,</HI> that the World might read his excellent parts in lively <HI>characters.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="89">He told the Lords he came thither in imitation of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh his great Predecessor, and the reason he came no sooner was, that he resolved with <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> for seven years to keep silence, and learn the Laws of the Kingdom, before he would teach others, and the other seven years he was studying to find an occasion to come, that might not be with prejudice: For in his own cause he could not come; in a great cause betwixt man and man, it might be thought some particular <HI>favour</HI> brought him thither; and in a small Cause it was not fit for him to come; but now he had so much to say in relation to good Government, that he could no longer forbear.</P>
<P><LIST>
<ITEM>First, He charges himself.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Secondly, The judges.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Thirdly, The Auditory in general.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>In his own Charge he lays a foundation for raising a most ex|cellent <HI>structure</HI> in Government, wherein he was a Master-work|man, and had a most admirable <HI>Theory,</HI> and full abilities to put it in practice, and happily the bent of his <HI>intentions</HI> tended that way, though it had for the most part a loose strong.</P>
<P>And to that which concerned the Judges, he not only reckons up their <HI>Duties</HI> in their publick <HI>Relation,</HI> but shews them the <HI>Iu|risdiction</HI> and power of their several Courts, how far every one did extend, to which he would have them limited, that they might not clash and contest one against another, to shake the <HI>Basis</HI> on which they were built, but that there might be a <HI>har|mony</HI> and sweet <HI>concordance</HI> among them, Expressing himself with such <HI>Elegance</HI> and <HI>Prudence,</HI> that the most studious <HI>Lawyer</HI> (whose <HI>design</HI> had been to imbellish a <HI>Discourse</HI> fitting for the <HI>ears</HI> of his Prince) could not have gone beyond what he exprest to his People; so strong and retentive was his <HI>judgment,</HI> and <HI>memo|ry,</HI> so <HI>natural,</HI> and <HI>genuine</HI> that which came from them, that it did <HI>emanare,</HI> flow from him to the <HI>admiration</HI> of the hearers.</P>
<P>To the people in general, and under-Officers, he gave an <HI>ad|monition</HI> to submit to the Law, and Justice of the Land, and not to go upon new <HI>Puritan strains</HI> (such was his expression) to make all things popular, but to keep themselves within the an|tient <HI>limits</HI> of <HI>Obedience: For he feared Innovation as a Monster got loose, which should be always kept in such a Labyrinth, as none should come at, but by the Clew of Reason.</HI></P>
<P>Then he commands the Judges in their <HI>Circuits</HI> to take no|tice of those Justices of the Peace, that were most active for the good of the Country, that they might have incouragement from him. <HI>For</HI> (to use his own words) <HI>I value them that serve me faithfully there, equally with those that attend my person.</HI> Therefore let none be ashamed of this Office, or be discouraged in being a Justice of the Peace, if he serve worthily in it.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="89">The Chancellor under me makes Justices, and puts them out; but neither I, nor he, can tell what they are: therefore we must be informed by you, Judges, who can only tell, who do well, and who do ill, without which how can the good be cherished, and the rest put out? the good Justices are careful to attend the service of the King and Country; the bad are idle slow-bellies, that abide always at home, given to a life of ease and delight, liker <HI>Ladies</HI> than <HI>Men</HI>; and think it is enough to contemplate Justice, when as, <HI>Virtusin actione consistet</HI>; con|templative Justice is no Justice, and contemplative Justices are fit to be put out.</P>
<P>Another sort of Justices, are Busie-bodies, and will have all men dance after their <HI>Pipe,</HI> and follow their Greatness, or else will not be content: A sort of men, <HI>Qui se primos omnium esse putant, nec sunt tamen</HI>: These proud <HI>spirits</HI> must know that the Country is ordained to follow God, and the King, and not them.</P>
<P>Another sort are they that go seldom to the Kings service, but when it is to help some of their Kindred or Alliance; so they come to help ther Friends, or hurt their Enemies, making Jugice serve for a shadow to <HI>Faction,</HI> and tumultuating the Country.</P>
<P>Another sort are Gentlemen of great worth in their own <HI>con|ceit,</HI> and cannot be content with the present <HI>form</HI> of <HI>Govern|ment,</HI> but must have a kind of <HI>liberty</HI> in the people, and <HI>must be gracious Lords,</HI> and <HI>Redeemers</HI> of their <HI>Liberty</HI>; and in every cause that concerns <HI>Prerogative</HI> give a snatch against <HI>Monarchy,</HI> through their <HI>Puritanical</HI> itching after <HI>Popularity,</HI> some of them have shewed themselves too bold of late in the lower House of Par|liament; And when all is done, if there were not a King, they would be less cared for than other men. So wise the Kings <HI>fears</HI> made him, and so wary to prevent the <HI>popular</HI> violence! And even in these Infant-times, the contention doth appear, which afterward got more strength, when by his power he had gained in every County such as he made subservient to his will: For as the King strove to loosen the Piles and Banks of the peoples liberties, so the people strove to bound, and keep off the Inun|dation of his <HI>Prerogative.</HI></P>
<P>Then he takes notice of the <HI>swarms</HI> of <HI>Gentry,</HI> that through the instigation of their Wives, or to new model and fashion their Daughters (who if they were unmarried mar'd their Marriages, if married, lost their Reputations, and rob their husbands pur|ses) did neglect their Country Hospitality, and cumber the City, a general <HI>Nuisance</HI> to the Kingdom, being as the <HI>spleen</HI> to the Body, which as in <HI>measure</HI> it over-grows, the Body wasts; and seeing a <HI>Proclamation</HI> will not keep them at <HI>home,</HI> he requires that the power of the <HI>Star-chamber</HI> may not only regulate them,
<PB REF="90">
but the exorbitancy of the <HI>new buildings</HI> about the City (which he still much repined at) being a <HI>shelter</HI> for them;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A. Reg.</HI> 15. <HI>An.

Thus the <HI>King</HI> pried into every <HI>miscarriage,</HI> being willing to re|form these (then growing) abuses.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Unstable spi|rits mutable.</NOTE>But among all the heights of Reason that the spirit of man doth actuate, and give life to, the highest and most transcen|dent is that of <HI>Religion,</HI> which as it partakes more or less of <HI>Faith,</HI> so it inclines more or less to <HI>Fancy</HI>: Wavering and un|stable <HI>minds</HI> are not only blown about with the wind of every <HI>opinion,</HI> but <HI>pride</HI> and <HI>discontent</HI> (conjoyned often, though of different <HI>operations</HI>) are <HI>engins</HI> sufficient to shake the <HI>foundation,</HI> though never so firmly setled. Some men turn over the leaf of <HI>Conscience,</HI> and change a good <HI>Religion</HI> for a worse; some the leaf of <HI>Policy,</HI> leaving an evil <HI>Religion</HI> for a better: but these kind of <HI>spirits</HI> will not be brought under by fasting and prayer, unless it be by him that can discover the <HI>heart</HI> of <HI>hypocrisie,</HI> though in as variable a <HI>capacity</HI> as the <HI>countenance.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Arch-Bishop of <HI>Spa|lato</HI> comes in|to <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> These times gave examples of both these <HI>humours,</HI> some that went from us to <HI>Rome,</HI> and some that came from <HI>Rome</HI> to us.

which like <HI>Climaterical Diseases,</HI> take rest, and after some inter|mission break out again. The very same <HI>Tragedy</HI> acted at this time, was newly revived there three and thirty years after, as is now in the year 1650. perspicuous to every eye of <HI>Reason</HI>; the <HI>Persons</HI> in <HI>power</HI> the same, running all in one <HI>parallel.</HI> The <HI>Queen-Mother</HI> and the Marquess <HI>D' Ancre</HI> then, the <HI>Queen-Mo|ther</HI> and the Cardinal <HI>Mazarino</HI> now; both <HI>Aliens,</HI> both <HI>Fa|vourites.</HI> The Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> (the Head, and prime of the <HI>Nobility</HI>) imprisoned then, for opposing the swelling greatness of that <HI>Favourite</HI>; The Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> and the other Princes, <HI>Conti</HI> and <HI>Longuevil,</HI> imprisoned now (though since set at liber|ty, having a powerful Army afoot) for opposing this. The <HI>Nobility</HI> rise in Arms against the young King, and his Mother, to assist the Princes; so they do now. The Complaints and Grievances are the same; The Princes repined that such an Upstart should manage all the great Affairs with so much licen|tiousness, and they sit still as lookers on, and have nothing to do; All Offices, both Civil and Military, bringing their Gar|lands, and strowing their choisest flowers at Marshal <HI>D' Ancre</HI>'s feet, which stunk in their <HI>Nostrils,</HI> and they infected the <HI>People,</HI> who are there but what the great <HI>Ones</HI> will make them; so that the Kingdom groaned under the insolencies of an insulting <HI>Mushroom,</HI> bred from the excrescency of <HI>Royal humours,</HI> as it doth now. <HI>Lewis</HI> the 14. fights with his <HI>Subjects</HI> now upon the same account that <HI>Lewis</HI> the 13. did then. But I can only give a <HI>Ca|tastrophe</HI> to one of these <HI>Tragedies</HI>; the last <HI>Act</HI> of this now a play|ing wants its <HI>Exit.</HI></P>
<P>And to conclude the first, <HI>Lewis</HI> the 13. finding his Mothers power swell so high, as to threaten a <HI>deluge</HI> of <HI>Noble Blood,</HI> for the preservation of a <HI>Mechanick Florentine,</HI> and willing to be rid of a <HI>Governess,</HI> who eclips'd his <HI>Glory,</HI> commanded Mon|sieur <HI>De Vitry,</HI> Captain of his Guard, to seize on the Marquess at his first access to Court. The Marquess (being then in his Government in <HI>Normandy,</HI> placing and displacing Officers, for his greater security) hearing there were new <HI>Whisperers</HI> admit|ted to the King, came to the Court in a full career, with a ruf|fling Retinue at his heels, thinking to remove all <HI>Obstacles</HI> in his way; but there he met the great <HI>One, Death,</HI> waiting for him, that his <HI>policy</HI> and high-flying thoughts never minded: For he had no sooner entred the Gates of the <HI>Louure,</HI> but <HI>De Vitry</HI> arrested him; and seeing him step back upon his arrest, as it were to lay hold on his <HI>Sword</HI>: he kill'd him instantly with a <HI>Pistol</HI>; The noise whereof put the whole Court into an up|roar. The King approved the Fact, the Queen lamented it; but she must mourn no longer in the Court, therefore removed thence with a small Train, to practice her <HI>Italian Artifices,</HI> as she afterwards did, to the disturbance of most parts of <HI>Christen|dom</HI>

The poor Marquess rested not in <HI>death</HI>; for though he was privately buried that night, yet the rage and malice of the People lighted them to his Grave the next day, and tearing him thence, and tying his naked body to an <HI>Asses</HI> tail, drew him through the Streets of <HI>Paris,</HI> and hanged him by the heels upon a Gibbet on the new Bridg; where they cut off flakes of his Body, to send as Presents to their Friends. And when they had satiated themselves thus, they took down the mangled Carcass, and made another Progress through the City, till wearied with their Delight, they strove <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o burn the Body, to be rid of it: but the fire being not so active as their malice, they threw the tattered bones into the River; so that their <HI>Rage</HI> pulled him out of the <HI>Earth,</HI> hung him in the <HI>Air,</HI> burnt him in the <HI>Fire,</HI> and left him in the <HI>Water.</HI> And (as they thought) to leave no memory of him, pulled down his house to the ground; which was afterwards ratified by publick <HI>justice,</HI> and his Wife was condemned by the same, and burned for a <HI>Witch.</HI> And to make their names the more odious, their very birth|places were ripped up, and they were both found to proceed from the <HI>dunghils</HI> of <HI>Florence.</HI> Thus ended this sad <HI>Tragedy</HI>; which serves as <HI>Lights</HI> and <HI>Sea-marks</HI> of <HI>Mortality,</HI> to teach us how to steer our <HI>brittle Bark</HI> in this <HI>Worlds Tempest,</HI> that we bear not too much <HI>sail,</HI> but keep a moderate and even <HI>course,</HI> be|twixt the <HI>rocks</HI> of <HI>pride,</HI> and <HI>shallows</HI> of <HI>contempt</HI>; both which are equally dangerous.</P>

All times were alike; and the Court being to remove to <HI>Theobalds</HI> the next day, the Carriages went through the City of <HI>London</HI> on the Sabbath, with a great deal of clatter and noise in the time of <HI>Divine service.</HI> The Lord Mayor hearing of it, commanded them to be stopt, and this carried the <HI>Officers</HI> of the Carriages with a great deal of <HI>violence</HI> to the Court, and the business being presented to the King with as much asperity as men in authority (crossed in their <HI>humors</HI>) could express it; It put the King into a great <HI>Rage, Swearing, he thought there had been no more Kings in</HI> England <HI>but himself</HI>; yet after he was a little cooled, he sent a <HI>Warrant</HI> to the Lord May|or, commanding him to let them pass, which he obeyed, with this <HI>Answer, while it was in my power I did my duty, but that be|ing taken away by a higher power, it is my duty to obey.</HI> Which the King upon second thoughts took well, and thanked him for it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Juggling of the Jesuits.</NOTE> As <HI>Prophaneness</HI> crept in on one side, so did <HI>Idolatry</HI> and <HI>Supersti|tion</HI> on the other; for there was more enmity against <HI>Ministers</HI> of the <HI>Gospel</HI> than <HI>Popish Priests</HI>; they swarmed over the King|dom, working <HI>miraculous Projects</HI> in every corner. One <HI>pack</HI> of them got into <HI>Stafford-shire,</HI> among some of the <HI>Giffords</HI> in that County, Gentlemen of good Estates, where they practised their <HI>Artifices</HI> to seduce the people. There must be a Ground-work, <HI>Estates</HI> to keep them (being like the <HI>Gout,</HI> never troubling the poor) and then there must be <HI>materials,</HI> Correspondents to act for them. <HI>Holiness</HI> and <HI>Piety</HI> must be confirmed by <HI>Miracle,</HI> and these <HI>Miracles</HI> must be visible to the Peoples eyes, that they
<PB N="107" REF="95">
may convey <HI>belief</HI> better to the <HI>heart.</HI> If the <HI>Priests</HI> be holy, and can subdue <HI>Satan,</HI> the <HI>Religion</HI> they profess must be heavenly, that triumphs over <HI>principalities,</HI> and <HI>powers,</HI> and <HI>spiritual wickedness,</HI> bringing all to obedience. These are finesses and subtilties of Mastring Wits (calling them <HI>Piae Fraudes,</HI> godly deceits, Worms to bring Fish to the Net) and this kind of <HI>frippery</HI> they are e|ver fraught with.</P>
<P>For about this time there was a Boy born at <HI>Bilson</HI> in that County,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Boy of <HI>Bilson.</HI></NOTE> whose father, mother, neighbours, and many other people, with admiration, did absolutely think possest with a <HI>Devil</HI>; for he had strange, sudden, violent, distorting fits, that appeared to all the beholders contrary to Nature, and being not full fifteen years old, it could not be imagined that any thing of Impostory could result from him, and therefore the <HI>same</HI> of it was the more remarkable.</P>
<P>The <HI>Iesuits</HI> (that are the best <HI>Physicians</HI> in such <HI>Distempers</HI>) hearing of it, visited the Boy, prayed by him, and used such other Charms and Exorcisms, as are fit to make them to be ad|mired; giving his Parents good hope of dispossessing him of that <HI>foul spirit,</HI> by which might palpably be discerned, how much Gods power was exprest in their weakness, and difference the <HI>truth,</HI> and <HI>holiness,</HI> betwixt the <HI>Catholick Religion,</HI> and the <HI>Heresie</HI> professed among <HI>Protestants.</HI> So that they that heard them (as many resorted to the place) must needs take them for very <HI>holy men,</HI> by whom such Wonders were to be accom|plished. The <HI>Iesuits</HI> visited him often, sometimes in private. sometimes in Company; but this kind of <HI>Spirit</HI> would not be commanded by them, so that they grew almost desperate of the Cure.</P>
<P>The Boy in his fits would rave against an old woman dwel|ling near to his Father,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Accuses a Wo|man to be a Witch.</NOTE> intimating by signs, and ghastly beha|viour, that she had sent a Spirit to torment him; and in plain terms (when he was out of his fits) accused her to be a <HI>Witch,</HI> and the <HI>Author</HI> of all his <HI>misery.</HI> This old woman is sent to the <HI>Bishops Chancellor</HI> at <HI>Lichfield</HI> to be examined; the Boy is brought thither to confront her, and having his back towards her, at her coming into the Room, where the <HI>Chancellor</HI> was, before she yet entred or appeared, he falls into a most bitter <HI>Agony,</HI> crying out, <HI>Now she comes, now my Tormentor comes</HI>! wreathing and tea|ring himself in so horrid a manner, that it did not only breed amazement, but pity in the Spectators, there being many with expectation attending the issue: Which, with some other <HI>pro|babilities,</HI> were an inducement to the <HI>Chancellor</HI> to send the wo|man to <HI>Stafford</HI> Goal.</P>
<P>At the next <HI>Assizes</HI> for that County, the Boy and his Parents appear as Witnesses against the <HI>Witch</HI>; the Boy was placed in a conspicuous part of the <HI>Court,</HI> with his face to the <HI>Bench,</HI> ey|ing
<PB N="108" REF="96">
the Judg continually, in a very peaceable and quiet po|sture; and as the woman was coming in (when the <HI>Court</HI> thought it impossible the Boy should be sensible of her appea|rance) he fell into a more raging fit than ever he was possest with before: So stupendiously unnatural, that it was deemed by all that saw it, that nothing but a <HI>Diabolical Spirit</HI> could work such horrid effects. This, thus openly acted, and the Relation of what was done at <HI>Lichfield,</HI> and other <HI>probabilities</HI> evidencing, the old woman (that had no good Reputation among her Neighbours, being of a tetrical and froward temper, incident to old age) found few Friends to plead her Cause; so that be|ing indicted for <HI>Witchcraft,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">She is con|demned.</NOTE> she was found guilty by the <HI>Iury,</HI> and Condemned to die.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bishop <HI>Morton</HI> gets her Re|prieve.</NOTE> Doctor <HI>Morton</HI> Bishop of that <HI>Diocess,</HI> a great <HI>Father</HI> of the <HI>Anglicane Church</HI> (and happily then on the <HI>Bench</HI> about <HI>Secular Affairs</HI>) hearing that some <HI>Romish Priests</HI> had been tampering with their Exorcisms, to the undevilling of the Boy, and find|ing little reason produced, why, or for what cause, the Witch should use the Child so ill, was perswaded, this might be some <HI>jugling trick</HI> in them, for effecting their <HI>miraculous ends.</HI> He therefore besought the <HI>Iudg</HI> to reprieve the woman till the next <HI>Assizes,</HI> and he would take the Boy home with him, have him carefully and strictly looked to, and doubted not before than time to find out the Bottom of some secret and hidden <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">rivance.</HI> The <HI>Iudg</HI> assented to the <HI>Bishop's</HI> request, and so the Boy was carried to <HI>Eccleshal Castle,</HI> the Bishops House, whi|ther his fits followed him with a great deal of violence: For being put out of his <HI>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad</HI> (having formerly all sorts of people come to admire him, and now being more carefully looked to) he grew <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">llen,</HI> and would not eat sometimes in two or three days, so that his <HI>belly</HI> was almost clung, and grown to his <HI>back,</HI> and he had a new <HI>swelling</HI> about his <HI>throat,</HI> which never appeared before; lay in his Bed, sometimes as it were senseless, sometimes st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ring with his eyes, and foaming at the mouth, sometimes striking those that stood near him (his own careful mother be|ing one, whom he made all black about the arms and breasts) never spoke but in his fits, and then a strange <HI>gibbrish,</HI> at other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> he only muttered and made signs. The Bishop visited him often, striving sometimes to soften him with gentleness, at other times he handled him roughly, with objurgations, and threatnings; but his ill Spirit is capable of neither. He spoke to him one time some of the <HI>Greek Testament,</HI> to see how that would work, and it brought him into his fit. At another time, he uttered some <HI>Verses</HI> out of the <HI>Greek Poets,</HI> which his <HI>Devil</HI> was not so learned as to distinguish, for that put him into a fit again; so that the Bishop was confirmed, that he was an Im|postor of a most pernicious, and pernicious Spirit; but how
<PB N="109" REF="96">
to <HI>Conjure</HI> it out of him was the difficulty. And finding <HI>words</HI> and <HI>menaces</HI> made no impression in him, he fell to <HI>blows</HI>; for ta|king him out of his Bed, and having one to hold him, the Bi|shop gave him six very smart <HI>lashes</HI> with a <HI>Rod,</HI> which moved the Boy no more than if he had been an insensible <HI>stock.</HI> They also thrust <HI>needles</HI> into his toes and fingers, betwixt the nails, clapt burning <HI>candles</HI> to his eye-lids, till they sing ed the hair off, to divert him when he was in his <HI>fits</HI>; but with all their persecutions he neither winch'd nor stirred, so that the <HI>Actors</HI> were more troubled to <HI>execute</HI> than he to <HI>suffer.</HI></P>
<P>And in this <HI>condition</HI> growing almost <HI>desperate,</HI> he would make <HI>signs</HI> for knives or any other instrument to do himself a mis|chief, therefore strict care was taken, and many watchful eyes set over him to prevent any such danger. Thus he continued almost a quarter of a year, at last his <HI>Vrine</HI> grew so black, that the <HI>Physicians</HI> thought <HI>Nature had left her usual operations,</HI> ha|ving never found in any Human Body so much <HI>Adust matter,</HI> to give so deep and deadly a <HI>tincture.</HI></P>
<P>This struck the good Bishop very near:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bishop troubled for the Boy.</NOTE> For he was certain the <HI>Priests</HI> had been Hammering about him, and now, if he should miscarry under his hand, those <HI>Mini-masters</HI> of mischief would in their dark <HI>shops</HI> coin such <HI>scandals</HI> against him, as might pass current in the Worlds <HI>opinion</HI>; therefore he used all the means he could possible, as well to preserve him, as to discover him: But finding the Boy indure so many Trials with <HI>patience,</HI> so much tough hardship, and robustness, in tender years, he resol|ved if his water continued black, to <HI>sit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> the matter no further. To find out which he set a trusty servant to watch him through a hole that looked into the Chamber upon the Bed, which the Boy knew not of. The Bishop going that morning with his Fa|mily to a Lecture, all things were very still in the house, and the Boy finding all quiet, no noise about him, he lifts himself up, stares, and listens, and at length gets out of his Bed, and in the <HI>straw</HI> or <HI>mat</HI> under it, takes out an <HI>Ink-horn,</HI> and makes water in the Chamber-pot through a piece of the <HI>Cotton,</HI> in his hand, another little piece of the <HI>Cotton</HI> he puts into his <HI>Prepuce,</HI> cove|ring it with the skin, and that was for a <HI>Reserve,</HI> if he should be forced to make water when company is by. Thus having cun|ningly put himself in <HI>order,</HI> he hides the <HI>Ink-horn</HI> again, and re|turns to his Bed.</P>
<P>The man that was appointed to watch him seeing all this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Impostor discovered.</NOTE> discovered it to the Bishop at his coming home, who came to him presently, and askt him how he did? He according to his usual manner pointed to his water, looked ghastly on it, and mutter'd out his old howling tone. The Bishop that meant now to deal roundly with him, said, Sirrah, you have Ink in your bed-straw, which you make use of to black your water, and your
<PB N="110" REF="97">
knavery is found out; and calling in his man, he took out the Ink-horn where the Boy had hid it, and the man justified, that he saw him make water through the <HI>Cotton.</HI> Which (with the Bishops threatning to send him to the <HI>house</HI> of <HI>Correction</HI>) struck the Boy with such a sudden terror, that he rose from his Bed, fell upon his knees, and humbly besought the Bishop to pardon him, and he would discover to him the whole Truth. And as he put on his <HI>cloaths,</HI> the Bishop laid open the grievousness of his <HI>sin,</HI> which wrought so upon his <HI>spirit,</HI> that he melted into tears, crying to God for <HI>mercy. A very strange alteration</HI>! That, what he did but counterfeit, the <HI>Devil</HI> had so hardned in him, that all the Torments and Pains, inflicted by man could not produce a tear, till God that melted the <HI>Rock,</HI> had first touched the <HI>heart.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Confession.</NOTE> Then he confest a Pedler with a pack on his back met him when he was going to <HI>School,</HI> and with many inticing words perswaded him to go to Mr. <HI>Giffords</HI> house, assuring him of good entertainment, and by his <HI>allurements</HI> he went thither with him. There he found four <HI>Romish Priests,</HI> who gave him mony and many fair words, promising him great <HI>matters,</HI> if he would be conformable to their instructions. They were three days teaching him how to demean himself, and after he was well tu|tor'd, and had practised his <HI>tricks</HI> there privately, then they sent him home to his <HI>father</HI> (who thought he had been lost, and was much troubled for him) to exercise them in a more publick way. He came home in a very distracted manner, to the amaze|ment of his <HI>parents,</HI> and in short time drew much company to visit him, and his <HI>parents</HI> being poor got money from many <HI>cha|ritable people,</HI> which did incourage him to persist in that way. But when the <HI>fame</HI> of his being <HI>possessed</HI> with an evil <HI>Spirit</HI> was sufficiently <HI>bruited abroad,</HI> the <HI>Priests</HI> came to dispossess him, but he found so much sweetness in the <HI>ease,</HI> and profit of that life, that he would not be dis-inchanted by them, though they charmed never so cruelly; for they beat him, and pincht him, and used him bitterly ill, to make him desist. <HI>Thus were the de|ceivers deceived</HI>! The Bishop askt him why he accused the poor old woman of Witchcraft? He answered, the <HI>Priests</HI> told him he must lay the cause of his being <HI>possest</HI> upon some old woman, and she being known to him, and of a <HI>scolding humour,</HI> he fixt it on her. Then the Bishop askt him how he came to fall into his <HI>fits</HI> a little before the woman appeared in the room, both at her <HI>Examination</HI> and <HI>Arraignment,</HI> his back being to|wards her? for the first, at <HI>Lichfield,</HI> he said, he heard some about him mutter, <HI>She is here,</HI> which made him cry out, <HI>she comes, she comes</HI>: And for the second, at <HI>Stafford,</HI> he heard the people remove, and her <HI>chains</HI> gingle as she came, which gave him the <HI>sign.</HI> Lastly, he was asked how he made his throat

<PB N="111" REF="98">
swell, and he shewed, it was by thrusting his tongue (being very long) down his throat, which trick he found out himself; the rest were taught him by the <HI>Priests.</HI> Thus did the Bishop pre|serve an innocent old woman condemned by the Law to die, discover the abhominable <HI>forgeries</HI> of the <HI>Priests,</HI> and convert a wicked Boy, whom afterwards he bound Apprentice, and proved a good man. This Story I heard from the Bishop's own mouth, almost thirty years before it was inserted here. And the <HI>Result</HI> of all is, That <HI>Falshood</HI> with her <HI>painted countenance</HI> appears often as <HI>beautiful</HI> as <HI>Truth</HI> it self, deceiving many, speci|ally in this point of <HI>Witchcraft,</HI> which is a <HI>structure</HI> established in the <HI>vulgar fancy,</HI> that hath many <HI>odd passages</HI> and <HI>ways</HI> opening to it, and is many <HI>Airy-stories</HI> high; but being well examined, it will not prove (for the most part, I will not say always) paper-proof, as there may be occasion to express in another place.</P>
<P>The King took delight by the <HI>line</HI> of his <HI>Reason</HI> to sound the depth of such <HI>brutish Impostors,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King dis|covers many Impostors.</NOTE> and he discovered many: For in the Beginning of his Reign, <HI>Richard Haydock</HI> of <HI>New-Colledg</HI> in <HI>Oxford,</HI> practised <HI>Physick</HI> in the <HI>day,</HI> and <HI>Preached</HI> in the <HI>night</HI> in his Bed. His <HI>Practice</HI> came by his <HI>Profession,</HI> and his <HI>Preaching</HI> (as he pretended) by <HI>Revelation</HI>: For he would take a <HI>Text</HI> in his sleep, and deliver a good <HI>Sermon</HI> upon it, and though his <HI>Au|ditory</HI> were willing to silence him, by pulling, haling, and pinch|ing, yet would he pertinaciously persist to the end, and sleep still. The <HI>fame</HI> of this sleeping <HI>Preacher</HI> flies abroad with a light <HI>Wing,</HI> which coming to the Kings knowledg, he commanded him to the Court, where he sate up one night to hear him: And when the time came that the <HI>Preacher</HI> thought it was fit for him to be asleep, he began with a <HI>Prayer,</HI> then took a <HI>Text</HI> of <HI>Scrip|ture,</HI> which he significantly enough insisted on a while, but after made an <HI>excursion</HI> against the <HI>Pope,</HI> the <HI>Cross</HI> in <HI>Baptism,</HI> and the last <HI>Canons</HI> of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and so concluded sleep|ing. The King would not trouble him that night, letting him rest after his <HI>labours,</HI> but sent for him the next morning, and in <HI>private</HI> handled him so like a cunning <HI>Chirurgion,</HI> that he found out the <HI>sore</HI>; making him confess not only his <HI>sin</HI> and <HI>error</HI> in the <HI>act,</HI> but the <HI>cause</HI> that urged him to it, which was, That he apprehended himself as a buried man in the <HI>Vniversity,</HI> being of a <HI>low condition,</HI> and if something <HI>eminent</HI> and <HI>remarkable</HI> did not spring from him, to give life to his <HI>Reputation,</HI> he should never appear any Body, which made him attempt this <HI>Novelty</HI> to be taken notice of. The King finding him ingenuous in his <HI>Confessi|on,</HI> pardoned him, and (after his <HI>Recantation publickly</HI>) gave him preferment in the <HI>Church.</HI> Some others, both men and women, inspired with such <HI>Enthusiasms,</HI> and <HI>fanatick fancies,</HI> he reduced to their right <HI>senses,</HI> applying his <HI>Remedies</HI> suitable to the <HI>Distem|per,</HI>
<PB N="112" REF="99">
wherein he made himself often very merry (being happily practised, to be taken notice of by him) but some of their Sto|ries being a little <HI>coarse,</HI> are not so fit to be here related. And truly the loosness and carelesness of <HI>publick Iustice,</HI> sets open a door to such <HI>slagitious</HI> and <HI>nefarious actions,</HI> as <HI>severer times</HI> would never have perpetrated.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir <HI>Walter Rawleighs</HI> West-Indian Voyage.</NOTE> About this time, that gallant Spirit, Sir <HI>Walter Rawleigh,</HI> (who in his Recesses in the Tower, had presented in lively <HI>Cha|racters,</HI> the true Image of the <HI>Old World</HI>) made Accesses to the King, whereby he got leave to visit the <HI>New-World</HI> in <HI>America.</HI> Captain <HI>Kemish</HI> (one of his old Seamen and Servants) shewing him a piece of <HI>Ore</HI> in the Tower, of a golden complexion, (a glittering <HI>temptation</HI> to begin the work) assuring him, he could bring him to a <HI>Mine</HI> in <HI>Guiana</HI> of the same <HI>metal</HI>: which (toge|ther with <HI>Freedom,</HI> the <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Being</HI>) gave rise to this enterprise.</P>
<P>The King looking on <HI>Rawleigh</HI> as a man whose <HI>abilities</HI> might better the <HI>Nation,</HI> if improved the right way, gave him Liber|ty, and a Commission under the great Seal, to equip and set forth Ships, and Men for that service. His <HI>Reputation,</HI> and <HI>me|rit,</HI> brought many Gentlemen of Quality to venture their E|states, and Persons, upon the <HI>Design</HI>; and being gallantly fur|nished with all things necessary, either for <HI>Peace</HI> or <HI>War,</HI> they set out; and met no difficulties, till they came to <HI>Cape Vert</HI> in <HI>Afri|ca</HI>; and then they found the Winds averse to them, (contrary to the usual <HI>nature</HI> of it) with many violent Storms, which much impeded their <HI>Voyage</HI>: For they that usually <HI>navigate</HI> be|twixt <HI>Cape Vert,</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> run it in less than twenty days, but it took them double the time. And being driven from the Isle of <HI>Bravo</HI> by a Tempest, their left their Cables, Anchors, and Water-Cask behind them; so that by the length of the <HI>Time,</HI> heat of the <HI>Climate,</HI> and their want of <HI>Water,</HI> great sickness fell among them, and swept away many of their ablest men, both for Sea and Land.</P>
<P>But with much <HI>patience</HI> and <HI>hardship,</HI> getting sight of the Coast of <HI>Guiana,</HI> they came to an <HI>Anchor</HI> in five <HI>Degrees,</HI> at the River <HI>Caliana,</HI> where they landed their sick men, set up <HI>Bar|ges,</HI> and <HI>Shallops,</HI> which were brought out of <HI>England</HI> in <HI>Quar|ters,</HI> washed their Ships, and took in fresh Water, being fed and assisted by the <HI>Indians,</HI> that Sir <HI>Walter Rawleigh</HI> had former|ly known. Who (in this general <HI>contagion,</HI> having grappled long with sickness, and not yet able to move, otherwise than he was carried in a Chair) gave order to five small Ships to sail into the River <HI>Orenoque</HI> (having Captain <HI>Kemish</HI> for their Con|ductor) towards the <HI>Mine,</HI> the <HI>Star</HI> that directed them thither. And in these five Ships were five Foot-Companies, under the Command of Captain <HI>Parker,</HI> and Captain <HI>North,</HI> Brothers to
<PB N="113" REF="99">
the Lord <HI>Monteagle,</HI> and the Lord <HI>North</HI>; Captain <HI>Walter Ra|leigh,</HI> the General's eldest Son; Captain <HI>Thornhurst,</HI> and Captain <HI>Chidley,</HI> Gentlemen of great Valour, and infinite Patience, in suffering hunger, heat and labour. Major <HI>Pigot</HI> died in the mi|serable Passage, and Sir <HI>Warham Santleger</HI> (who was Lieutenant Colonel) lay sick, without hope of life; so that the Command of the five Companies being conferred upon <HI>George Raleigh,</HI> the General's Nephew (made Major, in <HI>Pigot</HI>'s room) he was not so well obeyed, as the Enterprise required. As they past up the River, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> began the War, and shot at the Ships, both with their Ordnance, and Musket: but they landed their For|ces, without any great loss, near unto a Town upon the Ri|ver, called Saint <HI>Thome,</HI> and gallantly charged the Enemy to the very Ports; where finding some little opposition, they at last forced a passage, and made themselves Masters of the Town. In the Assault, Captain <HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI> the General's Son (a Man of fire and courage, fitter to execute, than to order his Valour) was slain, to the great grief of the Con|querours.</P>
<P>The other five Ships staid with the General at <HI>Trinidado,</HI> having no other Port capable of them near <HI>Guiana.</HI> The first was commanded by the General himself; the second by Cap|tain <HI>Iohn Pennington,</HI> Vice-Admiral; the third by Sir <HI>Warham Santleger</HI>; the fourth by Sir <HI>Iohn Fern</HI>; the fifth by Captain <HI>Chidley</HI> of <HI>Devonshire.</HI> The General had twelve Ships in all, set out with him; But Captain <HI>Whitney</HI> and Captain <HI>Wolleston</HI> mutined against him, and run home again from the <HI>Granadoes.</HI> With these five Ships they daily attended the <HI>Armada</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> and had they set upon them, their Force divided (one half be|ing in <HI>Orinoque,</HI> a hundred and fifty miles from them) they in <HI>Trinidado</HI> had not only been indangered, but all those in the River had also perished. And though these five Ships with the General were but of little Defence against so strong a <HI>power</HI> as the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Gallions, yet they would have given them their hands full, for they were all resolved to have burned, and died by their sides. But the <HI>Armada</HI> staid for them at <HI>Mar|garita,</HI> by which Island they expected them to pass towards the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>For the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Design discovered to <HI>Gondemar.</HI></NOTE> unwilling to displease his Brother of <HI>Spain,</HI> commanded Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> upon his Allegiance, before he went out, to set down under his hand, the Country, and the River, which he was to enter, the compleat number of his Men, the burthen of his Ships, and what Ordnance every Ship car|ried; which being made known to the Count <HI>Gondemar,</HI> the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ambassador here, and by him in Post to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> A Dispatch was made by that King to the <HI>Indies,</HI> and his Letters sent from <HI>Madrid,</HI> before Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> with his
<PB N="114" REF="100">
Fleet departed out of the River <HI>Thames.</HI> For the first Letter sent by a Bark of Advice, was dated the 19th of <HI>March,</HI> 1617. at <HI>Madrid.</HI> The second Letter was sent by a <HI>Carvell</HI> to <HI>Diego de Palomeque,</HI> at <HI>Trinidado.</HI> The third Letter by the Bishop of <HI>Puerto Rico</HI>; and the fourth was sent by the Farmer and Secre|tary of the <HI>Customs,</HI> at the same time. By that of the King's hand there was also a Commission, for the speedy leavying of three thousand men, and ten pieces of Ordnance, to be sent from <HI>Puerto Rico,</HI> for the defence of <HI>Guiana.</HI> These Provisions were made to entertain the <HI>English,</HI> and had they met them, they would have found a harsh Banquet.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Spaniards</HI> at Saint <HI>Thome</HI> (their Supplies being not come) were not so numerous as to defend both the Town, and the Passages to the Mines; therefore they quitted the Town, and fortified the way to the Mines near the Town. But the Passages leading to the Mine that <HI>Kemish</HI> had in his Eye, were <HI>Aspera &amp; fragosa,</HI> as Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> exprest them; and <HI>Ke|mish</HI> found the River so low, that he could not approach the banks, in most places near the Mine, by a mile; and where he found an ascent, a Volley of Musquets came from the Woods, and at one time slew two of the Rowers, hurt six others, and shot a valiant Gentleman, Captain <HI>Thornhurst,</HI> in the head, of which he with great difficulty recovered. <HI>Kemish</HI> seeing so much hazard in attempting to find the Mine, the Passage to it being full of thick and impassable Woods, and thinking the <HI>English</HI> that were left in the Town of Saint <HI>Thome,</HI> would not be able to defend it, especially if the Enemy should be recruit|ed, the Country being all in Alarum, he gave over the Enter|prise, and returned.

the number of six and fifty, by a dutiful <HI>Remonstrance</HI> pre|sented unto the States of <HI>Holland</HI> the sixteenth of <HI>October,</HI> the last year, being 1610. did most humbly beseech the said States, not to use their authority in compelling them to re|ceive a <HI>Professor,</HI> who both by the attestations of the Divi|nity-Colleges at <HI>Basil,</HI> and <HI>Heydelberg,</HI> as also by manifest evi|dence out of his own Writings, is convinced of a number of manifest Heresies.</P>
<P>These <HI>Reasons</HI> therefore, namely, the many enormous and horrible Heresies maintained by him; the Instance of his Majesty, grounded upon the welfare and honour of this Country; the Requests either of all, or of the most part of your <HI>Provinces</HI>; the Petitions of all the <HI>Ministers</HI> (excepting those only which are of <HI>Arminius</HI>'s Sect) should methinks prevail so far with my Lords the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> as they will at the last apply themselves to the performance of that, which both the <HI>sincerity</HI> of <HI>Religion,</HI> and the <HI>service</HI> of their <HI>Country,</HI> requireth at their hands.</P>
<P>Furthermore, I have Commandment from his Majesty, to move you in his name, to set down some certain <HI>Reglement</HI> in matters of <HI>Religion,</HI> throughout your <HI>Provinces,</HI> that this licentious Freedom of Disputation may be restrained, which breeds <HI>factions,</HI> and <HI>part-takings</HI>; and that you would absolutely take away the Liberty of <HI>Prophesying,</HI> which <HI>Vor|stius</HI> doth so much recommend unto you in the Dedicatory Epistle of his <HI>Anti-Bellarmine,</HI> the book whereof his Patrons do boast so much.</P>
<P>And his Majesty doth exhort you, seeing you have here|tofore taken Arms for the Liberty of your Consciences, and have endured a violent and bloody War the space of forty years, for the Profession of the Gospel, that now having gotten the upper hand of your <HI>miseries,</HI> you would not suffer the Followers of <HI>Arminius</HI> to make your <HI>actions</HI> an example for them to proclaim throughout the World that wicked Doctrine of the <HI>Apostacy</HI> of the <HI>Saints.</HI> The account which his Majesty doth make of your <HI>amity,</HI> appears sufficiently by the Treaties which he made with your <HI>Lordships,</HI> by the <HI>suc|cours</HI> which your <HI>Provinces</HI> have received from his <HI>Crowns,</HI> by the deluge of <HI>blood,</HI> which his <HI>Subjects</HI> have spent in your Wars. <HI>Religion is the only solder of this Amity.</HI> For his Ma|jesty being by the grace of God <HI>Defender of the Faith,</HI> doth hold himself obliged to defend all those who prosess the same <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Religion</HI> with him: But if once your <HI>zeal</HI> be|gins to grow cold therein, his Majesty will then straight|ways imagin, that your <HI>friendship</HI> towards him, and his Sub|jects, will likewise freeze by little and little.</P>

<P><Q>THat the <HI>States General</HI> had deliberated upon his Maje|stie's Proposition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The States an|swer.</NOTE> and Letter dated the 6 <HI>Oct.</HI> 1611. and do give him humble Thanks for the continuance of his <HI>Royal affection</HI> towards the welfare of their Country, and preservation of <HI>Religion.</HI> And that they had entred into Con|sultation concerning the <HI>Articles</HI> charged against <HI>Vorstius</HI>; and the <HI>Curators</HI> of <HI>Leyden</HI> did thereupon make an Order pro|visional, that <HI>Vorstius</HI> should not be admitted to the Exercise of his <HI>Place,</HI> but remain in <HI>Leyden</HI> only as an Inhabitant, and Citizen.

<P>But this Answer still savouring of <HI>delays,</HI> could not in effect be esteemed less than an absolute refusal to yield to the King's desires; besides, the <HI>specious Separation</HI> of <HI>Vortius</HI> as a Citizen, was only to satisfie the King at present; for he (after) not|withstanding exercised his Place of <HI>Professor.</HI> Whereupon Sir <HI>Ralph Winwood</HI> knowing the King's mind, made this Protesta|tion in their <HI>Publick Assembly.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THere is not any one of you,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir <HI>Ralph Win|wood</HI>'s Prote|station.</NOTE> I suppose, in this <HI>Assembly,</HI> that will not acknowledge the <HI>brotherly love</HI> where|with the King, my Master, hath always affected the good of your <HI>Provinces,</HI> and the <HI>fatherly care</HI> which he hath ever had to procure the <HI>establishment</HI> of your State. In which re|spect, his Majesty having understood, that <HI>Vorstius</HI> was elect|ed Divinity-Professor of <HI>Leyden,</HI> a Person attainted by many Witnesses, <HI>Iuris &amp; facti,</HI> of a number of <HI>Heresies,</HI> is therewith exceedingly offended. And for the timely prevention of an infinite of <HI>evils,</HI> did give me in charge to exhort you (which I did the 21 of <HI>September</HI> last) to wash your hands from that Man, and not suffer him to come within your <HI>Country.</HI> To this Exhortation your Answer was, <HI>That all due observance and regard should be had unto his Majesty</HI>: But his Majesty hath received so little <HI>respect</HI> herein, that instead of debar|ring <HI>Vorstius</HI> from coming into the <HI>Country</HI> (which even by the <HI>Laws</HI> of <HI>Friendship</HI> his Majesty might have required) the Proceedings have been clean contrary; for he is permitted to come to <HI>Leyden,</HI> hath been received there with all <HI>honour,</HI>
<PB N="124" REF="109">
taken up his habitation, treated and lodged in the <HI>quality</HI> of a <HI>publick Professor.</HI> His Majesty perceiving his first motion had so little prevailed, writ a Letter to you to the same purpose, full of zeal and affection, persuading you by many <HI>Reasons,</HI> not to stain your own <HI>honor,</HI> and the <HI>honor</HI> of the <HI>Reformed Churches,</HI> by calling unto you that wretched and wicked <HI>A|theist.</HI> These Letters were presented to this <HI>Assembly,</HI> the fifth of <HI>November</HI> last, at which time by his Majesties command I used some speech my self to the same effect. Some six weeks after I received an answer, but so confused, ambiguous, and imper|tinent, that I have reason to conceive there is no meaning at all to send <HI>Vortius</HI> away, who is at present in <HI>Leyden,</HI> re|ceived, acknowledged, respected, and treated as <HI>publick Pro|fessor,</HI> whether it be to grace that <HI>University</HI> instead of the deceased <HI>Ioseph Scaliger,</HI> or whether to give him means to do more mischief in <HI>secret,</HI> which perhaps for shame he durst not in <HI>publick,</HI> I cannot tell. For these reasons, according to that charge which I have received from the King my Master, I do in his name, and on his behalf, <HI>protest</HI> in this Assembly, against the wrong, injury, and scandal, done unto the Refor|med Religion, by receiving, and retaining <HI>Conradus Vorstius</HI> in the University of <HI>Leyden,</HI> and against the violence offered unto that Alliance which is betwixt his Majesty and your <HI>Pro|vinces</HI>; which being founded upon the <HI>preservation,</HI> and main|tenance of the Reformed Religion, you have not omitted to <HI>violate,</HI> in the proceeding of this cause. Of which enormous <HI>indignities</HI> committed against the Church of God, and against his Majestie's person, in preferring the <HI>presence</HI> of <HI>Vorstius,</HI> be|fore his <HI>amity</HI> and <HI>alliance,</HI> the King my Master holds him|self bound to be sensible, and if Reparation be not made, and that <HI>speedily</HI> (which cannot be by any other means, than by sending <HI>Vorstius</HI> away) his Majesty will make it appear unto the World by some Declaration (which he will cause to be printed and published) how much he detests the <HI>Atheisms,</HI> and <HI>Heresies</HI> of <HI>Vorstius,</HI> and all those that maintain, favour, and cherish them.</P>
</LETTER></P>
<P>To this the States promised a better Answer at their next <HI>Assembly,</HI> but that producing no good effect, the King writes a <HI>Declaration</HI> against <HI>Vorstius,</HI> which is extant in his own <HI>Works,</HI> collected by Doctor <HI>Iames Montague,</HI> son to Sir <HI>Edward Monta|gue</HI> of <HI>Bowghton</HI> in the County of <HI>Northampton,</HI> Knight, then Bi|shop of <HI>Winchester,</HI> and Dean of his Majestie's Chappel; in which <HI>Volume</HI> is depainted the King's excellent <HI>spirit,</HI> and many <HI>Royal Graces</HI> tending to <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Piety.</HI></P>

<P>And after, in the year 1613. there were many <HI>Discords</HI> a|mong them, which our King hearing of, he incited the States by Letters again (so willing he was to have <HI>Unity</HI> among them) that this <HI>War</HI> of the <HI>Tongue</HI> might be pacified rather by publick <HI>Authority</HI> than <HI>School Disputations,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Our King writes to the States in 1613.</NOTE> and by his <HI>Me|diation,</HI> for a good time the <HI>Humor</HI> was abated, or rested, as in the <HI>interpolate Fits</HI> of <HI>Agnes,</HI> but the <HI>Rancor</HI> broke out again more than ever.</P>

make himself (by his <HI>power</HI>) sole <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Monarch</HI> over them; that the <HI>Freedom</HI> which they had purchased with their <HI>bloods,</HI> was now ready to be trampled on; he that was their <HI>Servant,</HI> aspiring to become their <HI>Master</HI>; having all <HI>power</HI> both by Sea and Land, in his own hand; all Governments, and Offices at his <HI>dispose,</HI> so that he wanted nothing but the <HI>Title</HI> to make him absolute. These <HI>sparks</HI> took fire with many, and yet they could not well see by that <HI>light,</HI> because <HI>Barnevelt</HI> drew these preten|ces as a Curtain, to get as much <HI>power</HI> in the <HI>Militia,</HI> as he had in their <HI>Councils,</HI> the better to bring his <HI>ends</HI> about.

<P>This giving some stop to the <HI>carreir</HI> of the <HI>Remonstrants</HI> in <HI>Utrecht,</HI> the rest of the Towns took up, though they had run long uncurbed. And now the Prince and State thought of no|thing more than of composing the <HI>Disorders</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> by a <HI>National Council,</HI> which <HI>Barnevelt</HI> and his <HI>Faction</HI> opposing, they resolved to take away those <HI>impediments</HI> that hindered the <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Tranquility</HI> of the <HI>Provinces.</HI> So that on the 19th of <HI>August,</HI> the prime Ring-leaders of the <HI>Sedition, Barnevelt, Ho|genberts,</HI> and <HI>Grotius,</HI> were seised on at the <HI>Hague,</HI> as they were entring the <HI>Senate,</HI> and committed to several Prisons. This cast a general damp upon the <HI>spirits</HI> of the <HI>Remonstrants,</HI> as if they had been crushed in the head. And some few days after <HI>Ley|denburgh</HI> was sent from <HI>Utrecht</HI> with a strong Guard. These be|ing the four chief Pillars whereupon this confused Building stood, they being taken away, it fell to the ground. <HI>Ley|denburgh</HI> to prevent their <HI>mercy</HI> stabbed himself in Prison with a knife, that opened a passage to let out his life. <HI>Hogenberts,</HI> and <HI>Grotius,</HI> found something of mercy by waiting for it, but they were condemned to perpetual Imprisonment in the Castle of <HI>Lovestien.</HI> And the latter of them <HI>(Grotius)</HI> after some time of Imprisonment made an escape in a Trunk, which his Wife pre|tended to the Soldiers of the Castle, to be full of <HI>Arminian Books,</HI> which she would send away, because they should not trouble her Husband's head. But the <HI>Capital Offender, Barne|velt,</HI> was Beheaded at the <HI>Hague</HI> the fourteenth of <HI>May</HI> follow|ing, being 1619.</P>
<P>His Sentence of death was this,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Barnevelt</HI>'s Sentence and death.</NOTE> That for so much he had en|deavoured to disturb the Peace of the Land, and had opposed himself against the wholsom advice of divers Princes, Lords, and excellent Persons, aswel without as within the Land, and that he had injured some of their <HI>mightiest Allies</HI> by his secret practices (namely, by calumniating the King of Great <HI>Britain,</HI> as though he had been the Author of these troubles in the <HI>Low-Countries.</HI>) For that he had kindled the fire of Dissention in the Provinces; had raised Souldiers in the Diocess of <HI>Utrecht</HI>; had disreputed his <HI>Excellency</HI> as much as lay in his power; had re|vealed the secrets of the Council; and had received Presents and Gifts from Foreign Princes: Finally, for that by his Machi|nations and Plots, new States have been erected in the State, new Governments against the Government, and new Unions and Alliances against the ancient Union, to the general <HI>pertur|bation</HI>

<P>He was born in <HI>Amersford,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Imploy|ments.</NOTE> descended from the Antient Fa|mily of <HI>Olden Bernevelt</HI>; in his Fortune a private Gentleman, but by his Industry, Travels, and Studies at home and abroad, he made himself capable of managing the highest affairs, which he did almost for forty years together.

<P>A little before this time <HI>Ferdinand</HI> (Uncles Son to <HI>Matthias</HI> the <HI>Emperor</HI>) was Crowned King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Anno</HI> 1617.</NOTE> with this <HI>Reservation,</HI> that he should not exercise the Power of a <HI>King,</HI> as long as the old <HI>Emperor</HI> lived.

The <HI>Emperor</HI> kept his Court at <HI>Vienna,</HI> King <HI>Ferdinand</HI> at <HI>Gretz</HI> in <HI>Stiria</HI>; so that the Government of <HI>Bohemia</HI> rested in such Counsellors as the Emperor <HI>Matthias</HI> left there for the management of Publick Affairs. These Coun|sellors, and Ministers, with the Archbishop of <HI>Prague</HI> broke out about this time, not only to demolish the <HI>Protestant Churches,</HI> but by the help of the <HI>Iesuits</HI> (their bitter Enemies) strove to undermine the <HI>Religion</HI> it self.</P>
<P>The Protestant States, and Nobles of the <HI>Country,</HI> summon|ing an Assembly, to redress their Grievances, were opposed by some of them <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Ministers of <HI>State,</HI> the very day of their meeting; which exasperated them to such a height of <HI>Passion,</HI> (being backt by some Forces they brought with them for their Security) that they threw <HI>Slabata</HI> the Emperor's chief Justice, <HI>Smesansius,</HI> one of the Council of State, and <HI>Fabricius,</HI> a prag|matical, Secretary, from a high Window in the <HI>Castle,</HI> down

<P><HI>Ferdinand</HI> insinuated with the Princes of <HI>Germany,</HI> especially the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> to corroborate his party; the <HI>Bohemians,</HI> made <HI>election</HI> of our King's Son-in-law, the Prince Elector <HI>Pala|tine,</HI> to be their King, hoping his great <HI>Alliance</HI> would strengthen theirs.

As soon as they saw how the Enemy strove to secure himself, and that he was loth to come on, they judg|ed their strength not to be great, and therefore took a resolu|tion to set upon them.

For presently after he received a Denial in <HI>France,</HI> he sent to Sir <HI>Iohn Digby,</HI> his Leidger Am|bassador in <HI>Spain,</HI> to treat of a Marriage betwixt the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and the <HI>Infanta Maria,</HI> Sister to that King, which was in 1617. No <HI>blood</HI> but <HI>blood Royal</HI> can be a <HI>propitiatory Offering</HI> for his Son; yet the best <HI>Sacrifice</HI> is an <HI>humble spirit.</HI> No matter what <HI>Religion,</HI> what <HI>Piety</HI>; that is not the <HI>Question.</HI> When Kings have earthly aims, without consideration of God, God looks to

his own <HI>Glory,</HI> without respect of man. The little <HI>foundation</HI> of <HI>hope</HI> they built upon at that time, was now raised to a <HI>formal building,</HI> by the cunning practices of <HI>Gondemar,</HI> who assured the King, it was his Master's real intention the Prince should marry the <HI>Infanta.</HI> And he wished the King his Master had all the <HI>Pa|latinate</HI> in his power, to present it as a <HI>donative</HI> to the Prince with his fair Mistris.</P>
<P>The King (that now heard all was lost in <HI>Bohemia,</HI> saw little possibility of injoying the <HI>Palatinate</HI> quietly, but by the Treaty of a Marriage) was lulled asleep with <HI>Gondemar</HI>'s windy pro|mises, which Sir <HI>Iohn Digby</HI> seconded, being lately made Vice-Chamberlain to the King, Baron of <HI>Sherborn,</HI> and a great ma|nager of the affairs at Court. Sir <HI>Walter Aston</HI> being sent Leidger Ambassador into <HI>Spain,</HI> for the general correspon|dence. And the King anchoring his <HI>hopes</HI> upon these shallow promises, made himself unable to prevent the <HI>Tempest</HI> of <HI>War</HI> that fell on the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> tying up his own hands, and suf|fering none to quench the <HI>Fire</HI> that devoured his Childrens <HI>Patrimony.</HI></P>

Those that were looked on under the name of <HI>Spanish,</HI> were <HI>A|rundel, Worcester, Digby, Calvert, Weston,</HI> and some others <HI>Popish|ly</HI> affected; then <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and all the Train he swept along with him (except that party which his Mother managed) advan|ced the <HI>Spanish Match</HI> out of love to their Master.

And being loth to have the <HI>breach</HI> between him and his people made wider, he thus strives to stop the <HI>gap.</HI></P>
<Q><P>MY Lords,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Speech to the Parliament.</NOTE> <HI>Spiritual</HI> and <HI>Temporal,</HI> and you the Commons, <HI>cui multiloquio non deest peccatum.</HI> In the last Parliament <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> made long Discourses; especially to them of the Lower House, I did open the true thought of my heart. But I may say with our Saviour, <HI>I have piped to you, and you have not dan|ced, I have mourned, and you have not lamented.</HI> Yet as no man's <HI>Actions</HI> can be free, so in me, God found some spices of <HI>Vani|ty,</HI> and so all my sayings turned to me again, without any <HI>success.</HI> And now to tell the <HI>Reasons</HI> of your <HI>Calling,</HI> and this <HI>Meeting,</HI> apply it to your selves, and spend not the time in long <HI>Speeches.</HI> Consider, That the Parliament is a thing composed of a <HI>Head</HI> and a <HI>Body</HI>; the <HI>Monarch,</HI> and the two <HI>Estates</HI>: It was first a <HI>Monarchy,</HI> then after a <HI>Parliament</HI>; there are no <HI>Par|liaments</HI> but in <HI>Monarchical Governments</HI>; for in <HI>Venice,</HI> the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> and other Free-Governments, there are none. The <HI>Head</HI> is to call the <HI>Body</HI> together, and for the Clergy the Bishops are chief, for Shires their Knights, and for Towns and Cities their Burgesses and Citizens. These are to treat of dif|ficult matters, and to counsel their King with their best ad|vice, to make Laws for the Commonweal; and the Lower-House is also to petition the King, and acquaint him with their grievances, and not to meddle with their King's Prero|gative. They are to offer supply for his necessity, and he to di|stribute in recompence thereof <HI>Iustice</HI> and <HI>Mercy.</HI> As in all Parliaments, it is the King's office to make good Laws (whose Fundamental Cause is the peoples ill manners) so at this time. That we may meet with the new <HI>Abuses,</HI> and the in|croaching <HI>craft</HI> of the times, particulars shall be read hereafter.</P>

<P>As touching <HI>Religion.</HI> Laws enough are made already; it stands in two points, <HI>Persuasion</HI> and <HI>Compulsion.</HI> Men may per|suade, but God must give the <HI>blessing. Iesuits, Priests, Puritans,</HI> and <HI>Sectaries,</HI> erring both on the right-hand and left-hand, are forward to persuade unto their own ends; and so ought you the Bishops, in your example and preaching; but <HI>compulsion</HI> to obey, is to bind the Conscience.</P>
<P>There is talk of the <HI>Match</HI> with <HI>Spain</HI>: But if it shall not prove a furtherance to <HI>Religion,</HI> I am not worthy to be your King: I will never proceed, but to the Glory of God, and content of my Subjects.</P>
<P>For a <HI>supply</HI> to my <HI>necessities.</HI> I have reigned eighteen years, in which time you have had <HI>Peace,</HI> and I have received far less <HI>supply</HI> than hath been given to any King since the <HI>Conquest.</HI> The last Queen of <HI>famous memory,</HI> had one year with another above a hundred thousand pounds <HI>per annum</HI> in Subsidies. And in all my time I had but four Subsidies, and six Fifteens. It is ten years since I had a Subsidy, in all which time I have been sparing to trouble you. I have turned my self as nearly to save expence as I may. I have abated much in my Houshold-expences, in my Navies, in the charge of my Munition: I made not choice of an old beaten Soldier for my <HI>Admiral,</HI> but ra|ther chose a young man, whose <HI>honesty</HI> and <HI>integrity</HI> I knew; whose care hath been to appoint under him sufficient men to lessen my charges, which he hath done.</P>
<P>Touching the <HI>miserable dissentions</HI> in <HI>Christendom.</HI> I was not the cause thereof; for the appeasing whereof, I sent my Lord of <HI>Doncaster,</HI> whose journey cost me three thousand five hun|dred pounds. My Son-in-law sent to me for advice, but within three days after accepted of the Crown; which I did never approve of for three <HI>Reasons.</HI></P>
<P>First, for <HI>Religion</HI> sake, as not holding with the <HI>Iesuits</HI> dis|posing of Kingdoms, rather learning of our Saviour to uphold, not to overthrow them.</P>
<P>Secondly, I was no Judg between them, neither acquainted with the Laws of <HI>Bohemia. Quis me judicem fecit?</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, I have treated a <HI>Peace,</HI> and therefore will not be a <HI>party.</HI> Yet I left not to preserve my Childrens <HI>patrimony</HI>; for I had a Contribution of my Lords and Subjects, which amoun|ted to a great Sum. I borrowed of my Brother of <HI>Denmark</HI> seven thousand, five hundred pounds, to help him, and sent as much to him, as made it up ten thousand: And thirty thousand I sent to the Princes of the <HI>Union</HI> to hearten them. I have lost no time, had the Princes of the <HI>Union</HI> done their part, that handful of men I sent had done theirs. I intend to send by way of persuasion, which in this Age will little avail, un|less a strong hand assist. Wherefore I purpose to provide an

<P>The King was modest,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Doncaster</HI>'s Ambassy ex|pensive.</NOTE> and almost ashamed to tell the Parliament, how much Money the Viscount <HI>Doncaster</HI>'s J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur|ney cost, therefore he minces it into a small proportion. But this we know, when he landed at <HI>Roterdam,</HI> the first night and morning, before he went to the <HI>Hague,</HI> his Expences those two meals, in the Inn where he lay, came to above a Thou|sand Gilders, which is a Hundred pounds Sterling. And the Inn-keeper at the <HI>Peacock</HI> at <HI>Dort</HI> (hoping he would make that his way into <HI>Germany</HI>) made great Provisions for him, upon, no other Order, but a bare Fancy; and the <HI>Ambassador</HI> taking his way by <HI>Utricht,</HI> the Inn-keeper of <HI>Dort</HI> followed him, com|plaining that he was much prejudiced by his baulking that Town: For hearing of a great <HI>Ambassador</HI>'s coming, and what he had expended at <HI>Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erdam,</HI> I made (saith he) Preparations suitable, and now they will lye on my hands: Which coming to <HI>Doncaster</HI>'s ear, he commanded his <HI>Steward</HI> to give him Thirty pounds sterling, and never tasted of his Cup. And we have been assured by some of his Train, that his very Carriages could not cost so little as Threescore pounds a day, for he had with

Which Dish as it is not very pleasing and acceptable to the <HI>Scots</HI> Nation for the most part, so we know not whether it were by accident, or on purpose to displease him. But this is well known, there could be nothing more contemptible to the <HI>morose</HI> and <HI>severe</HI> temper of the Princes spirit, than this <HI>comport|ment</HI> of <HI>Doncaster</HI>'s, which most men interpreted to be <HI>pride</HI> and <HI>prodigality.</HI> But truly (set those vanities of <HI>Grandure</HI> aside, for the honor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His short character.</NOTE> though not profit of his Master) He was a Gentle|man every way compleat. His Bounty was adorned with Cour|tesie, his Courtesie not affected, but resulting from a natural Civility in him.

For he was grown very low, not having had the assistance of his people in ten years (as he himself notes) so that he was forced to lessen his Houshould, and bring his Expences down, not being willing to call a Parliament to supply him. Like <HI>Henry</HI> the third of <HI>England,</HI> whose Life and Reign, Sir <HI>Robert Cotton</HI> (that able understander and lover of <HI>Antiquities</HI>) wrote about this time, wherein he presents that King so fearful of calling Parliaments, that he would rather pawn his Crown Jewels, give over his House, <HI>&amp; cum Abbatibus, &amp; Prioribus prandere,</HI> dine and eat with the <HI>Monks,</HI> rather than be beholden to his people. And some thought this Piece of Sir <HI>Robert Cotton</HI>'s a Parallel for these times. But our King was not so much necessitated, though his wants were the greater, because they confined the greatness of his mind.</P>
<P>The main things which the Parliament insisted on (though many others came by the by) were the three great Patents;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The peoples grievances.</NOTE> for Inns, Ale-houses, and Gold and Silver thred. Upon every Inn, and Ale-house, there was a great Fine and Annual Reve|nue set, throughout the Kingdom, and they that would not pay so much as the <HI>Patentees</HI> assest them at, their goods and persons were seised on till they gave them satisfaction according to their <HI>voraginous humours.</HI> And they found out a new <HI>Alchimi|stical</HI> way to make Gold and Silver Lace, with Copper, and o|ther <HI>sophisticate materials,</HI> to couzen and deceive the people; and no man must make, or vent any but such <HI>Factors</HI> as they imployed, so that they ingrossed all the whole trade of that <HI>Ages vanity</HI> (which was enough) and gave them counterfeit ware for their money: And if any man were found to make any other Lace than what was allowed by them, they were made to know (to their dear experience) the power of these <HI>Ingrossers</HI>: And so poisonous were the <HI>Drugs</HI> that made up this deceitful <HI>Composition,</HI> that they rotted the hands and arms, and brought <HI>lameness</HI> upon those that <HI>wrought</HI> it; some losing their <HI>eyes,</HI> and many their <HI>lives</HI> by the <HI>venom</HI> of the <HI>vapours</HI> that came from it.</P>
<P>The chief <HI>Actors</HI> in this <HI>Pestilent business,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mompesson</HI> and <HI>Michel</HI> actors in them.</NOTE> were Sir <HI>Giles Mom|pesson,</HI> and Sir <HI>Francis Michel</HI>: These two moved all the under|wheels. <HI>Mompesson</HI> had fortune enough in the Country to make him happy, if that <HI>sphere</HI> could have contained him, but the vulgar and universal <HI>error</HI> of <HI>satiety</HI> with present injoyments, made him too big for a <HI>rustical condition,</HI> and when he came at Court, he was too little for that: So that some <HI>Novelty</HI> must be taken up, to set him (if he knew his own mind) in <HI>Aequilibrio</HI>
<PB REF="146">
to the place he was in; no matter what it was, let it be never so pestilent and mischievous to others, he cared not, so he found benefit by it. To him <HI>Michel</HI> is made <HI>Compartner,</HI> a poor sneaking Justice, that lived among the <HI>Brothels</HI> near <HI>Clerken-well,</HI> whose Clark and he pickt a livelyhood out of those <HI>corners,</HI> giv|ing Warrants for what they did, besides anniversary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ipends (the frequent Revenue of some Justices of those times) for conni|vency. I know how necessary and how splendent it is for men of <HI>publick minds</HI> to flourish in the execution of <HI>Iustice,</HI> for weeding out, and extirpating <HI>vitious habits,</HI> radicated in every corner; but this thing was a poisonous Plant in its own nature, and the fitter to be an Ingredient to such a Composition: Therefore he is brought to Court, Knighted, and corroborated by these Let|ters Patents, whereby he took liberty to be more ravenous up|on poor people, to the grating of the <HI>bones,</HI> and sucking out the very <HI>marrow</HI> of their substance.</P>
<P>These oppressions were throughly ripped up,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia|ments good|ness.</NOTE> and laid open by the House of Commons. But together with these proceed|ings they took notice of the King's wants, and thought fit some|thing to sweeten his temper, that they might not take from him the little profit he had by those Patents, but they would m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ke it up some other way, therefore they gave him two intire Sub|sidles, which were very acceptable unto him: For those Con|tributions that flow from the peoples love, come freely like a Spring-tide; But illegal Taxes racked from their <HI>bowels</HI> (com|ing through so many Promoters and Catchpoles hands) run very low, and the King hath the least share.</P>
<P>The King hearing these Patents were anatomized in the House of Commons, and willing to comply with his people, whom he found so bountiful unto him, he comes to the House of Lords to close gently with them, and excuse the granting of those Patents, shewing some reasons why he did them, and the instructions he gave for the execution of them, by which he hoped to take off that sharp reflexion that might light upon him. But the modesty of Parliaments seldom impute any of these <HI>miscarriages</HI> to the Prince, but the <HI>Actors</HI> under him must bear the burthen of it. And the time drawing near that the Lords assigned for judging the <HI>Malefactors,</HI> the King comes again to the House upon the 26 of <HI>March,</HI> and thus passed his sentence upon the Patents, before the Lords should pass theirs upon the executioners of them.</P>
<Q><P>My Lords,</P><P>THe last time I came hither,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Kings Speech to the Lords.</NOTE> my errand was to inform you (as well as my memory could serve me of things so long passed) of the <HI>verity</HI> of my proceedings, and the <HI>caution</HI> used by me in passing those Letters Patents, which are now in <HI>que|stion</HI>

before you, to the effect that they might not be abused in the execution: And this I did by way of <HI>Declaration.</HI> But now I am come (understanding the time of your <HI>censure</HI> at hand) to express my readiness to put in execution (which is the <HI>life</HI> of the <HI>Law</HI>) those things which ye are to <HI>sentence</HI> (for even the <HI>Law</HI> it self is a <HI>dead Letter</HI> without <HI>execution</HI>) for which office God hath appointed me in these Kingdoms. And though I as|sure my self that my former <HI>behaviour,</HI> in all the <HI>course</HI> of my life, hath made me well known for a just King; yet in this special case, I thought fit to express my own intentions, out of my own mouth, for punishment of things complained of. The first proof whereof I have given, by the diligent search I caused to be made after the person of Sir <HI>Giles Mompesson,</HI> who though he were fled, yet my Proclamation persued him in|stantly: And as I was earnest in that, so will I be to see your <HI>sentence</HI> against him put in <HI>execution.</HI></P>
<P>Two reasons move me to be earnest in the execution of what ye are to sentence at this time.</P>
<P>First, That duty I owe to God, who hath made me a King, and tied me to the care of Government, by that <HI>politick Marriage</HI> betwixt me and my people: For I do assure you in the <HI>Heart</HI> of an honest man, and by the Faith of a <HI>Christian</HI> King (which both ye, and all the World know me to be) had these things been complained of to me before the Parliament, I would have done the office of a just King, and out of Parliament have pu|nished them, as severely, and peradventure more than ye now intend to do. But now that they are discovered to me in Par|liament, I shall be as ready in this way, as I should have been in the other. For I confess, I am ashamed (these things prov|ing so as they are generally reported to be) that it was not my good fortune to be the only Author of the <HI>Reformation,</HI> and punishment of them, by some ordinary Courts of Justice. Nevertheless, since these things are now discovered by Parlia|ment, which before I knew not of, nor could so well have dis|covered otherwise, in regard of that <HI>Representative Body</HI> of the Kingdom, which comes from all parts of the Country; I will be never a-whit the slower to do my part for the execu|tion. For (as many of you that are here, have heard me of|ten say, and so I will still say) So precious unto me is the <HI>publick</HI> good, that no <HI>private person</HI> whatsoever (were he never so dear unto me) shall be respected by me by many degrees as the pub|lick good, not only of the whole Common-wealth, but even of a <HI>particular Corporation,</HI> that is a <HI>Member</HI> of it. And I hope that ye my Lords will do me that <HI>right,</HI> to publish to my peo|ple this my <HI>heart</HI> and <HI>purpose.</HI></P><P>The second <HI>Reason</HI> is, That I intend not to derogate or in|fringe, any of the Liberties, or Privileges of this House, but
<PB REF="148">
rather to fortifie and strengthen them: For never any King hath done so much for the Nobility of <HI>England</HI> as I have done, and will ever be ready to do. And whatsoever I shall say, and deliver unto you as my thought, yet when I have said what I think, I will afterwards freely leave the Judgment wholly to your House. I know you will do nothing but what the like hath been done before, and I pray you be not jealous that I will abridge you of any thing that hath been used: For what|soever the <HI>Precedents</HI> (in times of <HI>good Government</HI>) can war|rant, I will allow. For I acknowledge this to be the <HI>supreme Court</HI> of <HI>Iustice,</HI> wherein I am ever present by <HI>Representation.</HI> And in this ye may be the better satisfied by my own <HI>presence,</HI> coming divers times among you: Neither can I give you any greater assurance, or better pledge of this my purpose, than that I have done you the <HI>honor</HI> to set my only Son a|mong you, and hope that ye with him, shall have the means to make this the happiest Parliament that ever was in <HI>England.</HI></P><P>This I profess, and take <HI>comfort</HI> in, that the House of Com|mons at this time have shewed greater love, and used me with more respect in all their <HI>proceedings,</HI> than ever any House of Commons have heretofore done to me, or I think to any of my <HI>Predecessors.</HI> As for this House of yours, I have always found it respective to me, and accordingly do I, and ever did fa|vour you, as you well deserved. And I hope it will be ac|counted a <HI>happiness</HI> for you, that my Son doth now sit among you; who, when it shall please God to set him in my place, will then remember that he was once a Member of your House, and so be bound to maintain all your <HI>Lawful Privileges,</HI> and like the better of you all the days of his life. But because the World at this time talks so much of <HI>Bribes,</HI> I have just cause to fear the whole <HI>Body</HI> of this <HI>House</HI> hath <HI>bribed</HI> him to be a good <HI>Instrument</HI> for you upon all occasions: He doth so good Offices in all his <HI>Reports</HI> to me, both for the <HI>House</HI> in <HI>general,</HI> and every one of you in <HI>particular.</HI> And the like I may say of one that sits there, <HI>Buckingham</HI>; He hath been so ready upon all occasions to do good Offices, both for the <HI>House</HI> in <HI>general,</HI> and every <HI>Member</HI> in <HI>particular.</HI> One proof thereof, I hope, my Lord of <HI>Arundel</HI> hath already witnessed unto you, in his report made unto you of my answer touching the <HI>Pri|vileges</HI> of the <HI>Nobility,</HI> how earnestly he spake unto me of that <HI>matter.</HI></P><P>Now, my Lords, the time draws near of your <HI>Recess</HI>; whether <HI>Formality</HI> will leave you time for proceeding now to <HI>Sentence</HI> against all, or any of the persons now in <HI>que|stion,</HI> I know not. But for my part, since both Houses have dealt so lovingly, and freely with me, in giving me, as a free
<PB N="157" REF="148">
Gift, two Subsidies, in a more loving manner than hath been given to any King before, and so accepted by me. And since I cannot yet retribute by a <HI>General Pardon,</HI> which hath by Form usually been reserved to the end of a Parliament: The least I can do (which I can forbear no longer) is to do some|thing in present, for the ease and good of my People. Three Patents at this time have been complained of, and thought great Grievances.
<LIST>
<ITEM>"1. That of the Inns, and Hosteries.</ITEM>
<ITEM>"2. That of Ale-houses.</ITEM>
<ITEM>"3. That of Gold and Silver Thread.</ITEM>
</LIST>
My purpose is, to strike them all <HI>dead,</HI> and that Time may not be lost, I will have it done presently. That concerning <HI>Ale-houses,</HI> I would have to be left to the managing of Ju|stices of the Peace, as before. That of Gold and Silver Thread was most vilely executed, both for wrong done to mens persons, as also for abuse in the Stuff, for it was a kind of false Coin. I have already freed the Persons that were in Prison, I will now also damn the Patent, and this may seem instead of a Pardon. All these three I will have recalled by Proclamation, and wish you to advise of the fittest Form to that purpose.</P>
<P>I hear also there is another Bill among you against <HI>Infor|mers</HI>; I desire you, my Lords, that as you tender my <HI>Honour,</HI> and the good of my <HI>People,</HI> ye will put that Bill to an end as soon as you can, and at your next meeting to make it one of your first works: For I have already shewed my dislike of that kind of people openly in <HI>Star-Chamber,</HI> and it will be the greatest ease to me, and all those that are near about me at <HI>Court,</HI> that may be. For I remember, that since the beginning of this Parliament, <HI>Buckingham</HI> hath told me, he never found such quiet and rest, as in this time of Parliament, from <HI>Pro|jecters</HI> and <HI>Informers,</HI> who at other times miserably vexed him at all hours.</P>
<P>And now I confess, that when I looked before upon the face of the Government, I thought (as every man would have done) that the People were never so happy as in my time. For even as at divers times, I have looked upon many of my <HI>Coppices,</HI> riding about them, and they appeared on the outside very thick, and well-grown unto me, but when I turned into the midst of them, I found them all bitten with in, and full of Plains, and bare Spots, like an Apple or Pear fair and smooth without, but when ye cleave it asunder, you find it rotten at the <HI>heart</HI>: Even so this Kingdom, the external Government being as good as ever it was, and I am sure, as learned <HI>Iudges</HI> as ever it had, and I hope as <HI>honest,</HI> ad|ministring <HI>Iustice</HI> within it; and for <HI>Peace</HI> both at home, and
<PB REF="149">
abroad, I may truly say more setled, and longer lasting, than ever any before, together with as great <HI>Plenty</HI> as ever; so as it was to be thought, that every Man might sit in safety under his own <HI>Vine,</HI> and <HI>Figtree</HI>: Yet I am ashamed (and it makes my hair stand upright) to consider, how in this time my People have been <HI>vexed,</HI> and <HI>polled,</HI> by the vile execution of <HI>Projects, Patents, Bills</HI> of <HI>Conformity,</HI> and such like, which besides the trouble of my People, have more exhausted their <HI>purses</HI> than <HI>Subsidies</HI> would have done.</P><P>Now my Lords, before I go hence, since God hath made me the great <HI>Iudge</HI> of this Land under him, and that I must an|swer for the <HI>iustice</HI> of the same, I will therefore, according to my Place remember you of some things, though I would not teach you; for no man's <HI>knowledge</HI> can be so good, but their <HI>memories</HI> will be the better to be refreshed. And now, because you are coming to give <HI>Iudgment</HI> (all which moves from the the King) that you may the better proceed, take into your <HI>Care</HI> two things.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>"1. To do <HI>Bonum.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>"2. To do it <HI>Ben&eacute;.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>I call <HI>Bonum,</HI> when all is well proved, whereupon ye judge, for then ye build upon a sure <HI>Foundation.</HI> And by <HI>Ben&egrave;</HI> I understand, that ye proceed with all <HI>formality</HI> and <HI>legality</HI>; wherein you have fit <HI>occasion</HI> to advise with the <HI>Iudges,</HI> who are to assist you with their <HI>Opinions,</HI> in <HI>Cases</HI> of that <HI>Nature,</HI> and woe be to them if they advise you not well&punc; So the <HI>ground</HI> being good, and the <HI>form</HI> orderly, it will prove a <HI>Course</HI> sitting this High Court of <HI>Parliament.</HI></P>
<P> In <HI>Sentence</HI> ye are to observe two parts: First, to recollect that which is worthy of Judging, and Censuring; And Se|condly, to proceed against these, as against such like <HI>Crimes</HI> properly. We doubt there will be many Matters before you, some complained of out of <HI>passion,</HI> and some out of just Cause of <HI>grievance</HI>: Weigh both, but be not carried away with the impertinent Discourses of them, that name as well <HI>innocent</HI> men as <HI>guilty.</HI> Proceed judicially, and spare none, where ye find just Cause to punish: But let your Proceedings be ac|cording to <HI>Law,</HI> and remember that <HI>Laws</HI> have not their <HI>eyes</HI> in their <HI>necks,</HI> but in their <HI>foreheads.</HI> For the <HI>Moral Reason</HI> for the punishment of <HI>Vices</HI> in all Kingdoms, and Common|wealths, is, because of the breach of <HI>Laws</HI> standing in force; for none can be punished for breach of <HI>Laws</HI> by <HI>Predestination,</HI> before they be made.</P>
<P>There is yet one particular that I am to remember you of; I hear that Sir <HI>Henry Yelverton</HI> (who is now in the <HI>Tower</HI> upon a <HI>Sentence</HI> given in the <HI>Star-Chamber</HI> against him for deceiving my Trust) is touched concerning a Warrant <HI>Dormant,</HI> which
<PB N="158" REF="149">
he made while he was my <HI>Attorney</HI>: I protest I never heard of this <HI>Warrant dormant</HI> before, and I hold it as <HI>odious</HI> a mat|ter as any is before you. And if for respect to me ye have for|born to meddle with him, in examination, because he is my <HI>prisoner,</HI> I do here freely remit him unto you, and put him in|to your hands.</P><P>And this is all I have to say unto you at this time, wishing you to proceed justly and nobly, according to the <HI>Orders</HI> of your <HI>House</HI>: And I pray God to bless you, and you may assure your selves of my assistance; Wishing, that what I have said this day among you, may be entred into the <HI>Re|cords</HI> of this <HI>House.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Thus the King strove to mitigate the asperity and sharpness of the <HI>humors</HI> contracted in the Body of the Kingdom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Speech dis|canted on.</NOTE> that they might not break out to disgrace the <HI>Physician</HI>: For he looked up|on himself as an able <HI>Director,</HI> and yet he found he might be de|ceived; And therefore he brings the Lords into a <HI>Wood,</HI> compa|ratively to tell them, that they appeared to him well grown, and fair, but searching into them he found them otherwise. But he that pretended to the knowledge of all things, (as give him his <HI>due</HI> he was well known in most) could not be ignorant that the Patents he granted were against the Liberties of the people, but whether the execution of them to that <HI>extremity</HI> came with|in his <HI>Cognizance</HI> cannot be determined; his <HI>damning</HI> of them shews his dislike at present, condemning that which he knew would be done to his hand, if he had not done it; and this must not be known only at <HI>Westminster,</HI> and left upon <HI>Record</HI> to <HI>Po|sterity</HI> there, but he commanded his <HI>Speech</HI> to be printed, that all his people might know, how willing and forward he was to abolish any <HI>Act</HI> of his that tended to a <HI>grievance.</HI> And though he did not accuse the Marquess of <HI>Buckingham</HI> for giving way to Informers, yet he was much troubled with them till the Parlia|ment began; and in that numerous crowd those that brought profit were doubtless admitted with the first:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Buckingham</HI> Master of the Work.</NOTE> These considera|tions upon the King's Speech buzzed up and down, and many of the Parliament men looked upon the Marquess as the first mover of this great <HI>Machine</HI>; but the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of the House did not rise so high as to strike at the uppermost branches, but they pruned those roundly they could reach. <HI>Buckingham,</HI> though he were well grown, had not yet <HI>sap</HI> enough to make himself swell into <HI>exuberancy,</HI> as he did afterwards, nor was the peoples <HI>malice</HI> now against him so fertile, as to make every little weed, a dan|gerous and poysonous plant, being subtile enough (yet) to crop off any, that might appear <HI>venomous</HI> in relation to himself, that the <HI>mischievous operations</HI> might work upon others: For all the world knew <HI>Mompesson</HI> was his creature, and that notwithstand|ing the King's Proclamation for his interception, he got out of
<PB REF="150">
the Kingdom by his Key: For <HI>Buckingham</HI> ruled as a Lord <HI>Pa|ramount,</HI> and those that <HI>complied</HI> with him found as much <HI>refuge</HI> as his power could secure unto them; those that opposed him, as much <HI>mischief</HI> as <HI>malice</HI> could pour upon them. Sir <HI>Henry Yel|verton</HI> the King's Attorney had found the effects of his <HI>Anger,</HI> by not closing with his desires in such Patents as he required; so that all his <HI>Actions</HI> being <HI>anatomized,</HI> some <HI>miscarriages</HI> are made <HI>criminal,</HI> he is committed to the Tower, and another put in his place that should be more <HI>observant.</HI> The King now lays upon him a Warrant <HI>Dormant,</HI> which did not much startle him; for he was not long after released and made a <HI>Iudge,</HI> carrying with him this <HI>character</HI> of <HI>honesty,</HI> That he was willing to lay down his pre|ferment at the King's feet, and be trod upon by the growing power of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> rather than prosecute his <HI>Patron Somerset,</HI> that had advanced him, as his Predecessor <HI>Bacon</HI> had spitefully done his. But whether that <HI>Dialogue</HI> betwixt <HI>Buckingham</HI> and <HI>Yelverton</HI> in the Tower, mentioned in our King's <HI>Court,</HI> have any thing of Truth, cannot be asserted here, <HI>Buckingham</HI> being not ar|rived yet to the <HI>Meridian height</HI> of his <HI>Greatness,</HI> though the King afterwards had cause enough to be jealous of his <HI>Actions.</HI></P>
<P>But now comes the old <HI>Iustice,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Michel</HI> censu|red.</NOTE> Sir <HI>Francis Michell,</HI> to his <HI>Cen|sure,</HI> and the <HI>crime</HI> he had committed arguing a <HI>base spirit,</HI> he is fitted with as <HI>suitable</HI> a <HI>punishment.</HI> First he is <HI>degraded,</HI> with all the <HI>ceremonies</HI> of <HI>debasement</HI>; but that being most proper to his <HI>nature,</HI> he was but eased of a <HI>burthen,</HI> his mind suffered not; but then his <HI>kecksie carkass</HI> was made to <HI>ride Renvers</HI> with his face to the <HI>horse tail</HI> (with a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">per on his breast and back, that pointed at the <HI>foulness</HI> of the <HI>cause</HI>) through the whole City, suffering under the scorn, and contempt of <HI>Boys,</HI> and rabble of the people, besides the squeezing of him by fine and confinement to prison, that he might never be more capable of <HI>mischief.</HI> The same sentence had Sir <HI>Giles Mompesson,</HI> but he was so <HI>provident</HI> as not to be found to pay it in his person, though he paid it in his purse. Some others also, their Instruments, though not so sharp|ly dealt with, had great <HI>mulcts</HI> laid upon them according to their <HI>demerit,</HI> and so this <HI>Gangrene</HI> was healed up.</P>
<P>Not long after comes the great <HI>Lord Chancellor Bacon</HI> to a <HI>Cen|sure,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lord Chancellor <HI>Bacon</HI> que|stioned.</NOTE> for the most <HI>simple,</HI> and <HI>ridiculous follies,</HI> that ever entred into the <HI>heart</HI> of a <HI>Wise man.</HI> He was the true <HI>Emblem</HI> of <HI>humane frailty,</HI> being <HI>more</HI> than a <HI>man</HI> in some things, and less than a <HI>woman</HI> in others. His <HI>crime</HI> was <HI>Bribery,</HI> and <HI>Extortion</HI> (which the King hinted at in his Speech, when he <HI>facetiously</HI> said, <HI>He thought the Lords had bribed the Prince to speak well of them</HI>) and these he had often condemned others for as a <HI>Iudge,</HI> which now he comes to suffer for as a <HI>Delinquent</HI>: And they were proved, and aggravated against him with so many <HI>circumstances,</HI> that they fell very <HI>fouly</HI> on him, both in <HI>relation</HI> to his <HI>Reception</HI> of them,

and his expending of them: For that which he raked in, and scrued for one way, he scattered and threw abroad another; for his Servants, being young, prodigal and expensive Youths, which he kept about him, his Treasure was their common Store, which they took without stint, having free ac|cess to his most retired Privacies; and his indulgence to them, and familiarity with them, opened a <HI>gap</HI> to infamous <HI>Reports,</HI> which left an unsavoury <HI>Tincture</HI> on him; for where such <HI>Leeches</HI> are, there must be <HI>putrid blood</HI> to fill their <HI>craving Ap|petites.</HI> His <HI>gettings</HI> were like a <HI>Prince,</HI> with a strong hand; his <HI>expences</HI> like a <HI>Prodigal,</HI> with a weak head; and 'tis a wonder a man of his Noble, and Gallant Parts, that could fly so high above <HI>Reason,</HI> should fall so far below it; unless that <HI>Spirit</HI> that <HI>acted</HI> the first, were too proud to stoop, to see the <HI>deformi|ties</HI> of the last.

<P><LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Right Honourable the Lords of the Par|liament, in the Upper House assembled, The humble Submission and Supplication of the Lord Chancellor.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please your Lordships</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Shall humbly crave at your hands a benign interpretation of that which I shall now write:<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Suppli|cation.</NOTE> for <HI>words</HI> that come from wasted <HI>spirits,</HI> and oppressed <HI>minds,</HI> are more safe, in being deposited to a noble <HI>construction,</HI> than being circled with any reserved <HI>caution.</HI></P>
<P>This being moved (and as I hope, obtained of your Lord|ships) as a <HI>protection</HI> to all that I shall say, I shall go on; but with a very strange <HI>Entrance,</HI> as may seem to your Lordships at first: for in the midst of a <HI>State,</HI> of as great <HI>affliction,</HI> as
<PB REF="152">
I think a <HI>mortal man</HI> can endure (<HI>Honour being above Life</HI>) I shall begin with the professing of gladness in somethings.</P>
<P>The first is, That hereafter the <HI>greatness</HI> of a <HI>Iudge,</HI> or <HI>Ma|gistrate,</HI> shall be no <HI>sanctuary,</HI> or <HI>protection</HI> to him against <HI>guil|tiness,</HI> which is the beginning of a <HI>golden work.</HI></P>
<P>The next. That after this <HI>Example,</HI> it is like that <HI>Iudges</HI> will fly from any thing in the likeness of <HI>Corruption</HI> (though it were at a great distance) as from a <HI>Serpent:</HI> Which tends to the purging of the <HI>Courts</HI> of <HI>Iustice,</HI> and reducing them to their true <HI>honour,</HI> and <HI>splendor.</HI> And in these two <HI>Points</HI> (<HI>God is my witness</HI>) though it be my <HI>fortune</HI> to be the <HI>Anvil</HI> upon which these two <HI>effects</HI> are broken and wrought, I take no small <HI>comfort.</HI> But to pass from the <HI>motions</HI> of my <HI>heart,</HI> (<HI>whereof of God is my Iudge</HI>) to the <HI>merits</HI> of my <HI>cause,</HI> whereof your <HI>Lordships</HI> are <HI>Iudges,</HI> under <HI>God</HI> and his <HI>Lieutenant</HI>; I do understand, there hath been heretofore expected from me some <HI>justification</HI>; and therefore I have chosen one only <HI>justification,</HI> instead of all others, out of the <HI>justification</HI> of <HI>Iob.</HI> For after the clear <HI>submission</HI> and <HI>confession</HI> which I shall now make unto your Lordships, I hope I may say and justifie with <HI>Iob,</HI> in these words, <HI>I have not hid my sin, as did</HI> Adam, <HI>nor concealed my faults in my bosom.</HI> This is the only <HI>justifi|cation</HI> which I will use.</P>
<P>It resteth therefore, that without <HI>Fig-leaves,</HI> I do ingenu|ously confess, and acknowledge, that having understood the <HI>Particulars</HI> of the <HI>Charge,</HI> not formally from the <HI>House,</HI> but enough to inform my <HI>conscience</HI> and <HI>memory,</HI> I find <HI>matter</HI> suffi|cient, and full, both to move me to desert my <HI>defence,</HI> and to move your Lordships to <HI>condemn</HI> and <HI>censure</HI> me. Neither will I trouble your Lordships, by singling those <HI>Particulars,</HI> which I think might fall off. <HI>Quid te exempla juvant spinis de pluribus Uva?</HI> Neither will I prompt your Lordships to observe up|on the <HI>proofs,</HI> where they come not home, or the <HI>scruple</HI> touch|ing the <HI>credits</HI> of the <HI>Witnesses.</HI> Neither will I represent to your Lordships, how far a <HI>defence</HI> might in divers things ex|tenuate the <HI>offence,</HI> in respect of the <HI>time,</HI> and manner of the <HI>guilt,</HI> or the like <HI>circumstances</HI>: But only leave these things to spring out of your more noble thoughts, and observations of the <HI>Evidence,</HI> and examinations themselves; and <HI>charitably</HI> to wind about the <HI>Particulars</HI> of the <HI>Charge,</HI> here and there, as God shall put into your <HI>minds,</HI> and so submit my self wholly to your <HI>piety</HI> and <HI>grace.</HI></P>
<P>And now I have spoken to your Lordships as <HI>Iudges,</HI> I shall say a few words unto you as <HI>Peers</HI> and <HI>Prelates,</HI> humbly com|mending my <HI>Cause</HI> to your <HI>noble minds,</HI> and <HI>magnanimous affections.</HI></P>

<P>Thus was his great <HI>spirit</HI> brought low,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His censure.</NOTE> and this <HI>humiliation</HI> might have raised him up again, if his <HI>offences</HI> had not been so weighty as to keep him down. He lost his <HI>Peerage</HI> and <HI>Seal,</HI> and the <HI>Scale</HI> was wavering whether he should carry the <HI>Title</HI> of <HI>Vis|count St. Albans</HI> to his <HI>grave,</HI> and that was all he did; having only left a poor empty <HI>being,</HI> which lasted not long with him, his <HI>honor</HI> dying before him. And to heighten his <HI>misery</HI> the more, many others were crushed to pieces by his <HI>fall</HI>; for he had a <HI>vast debt</HI> lay upon him, which they were forced to pay; and though he had a <HI>Pension</HI> allowed him by the King, he wanted to his last, living obscurely in his Lodgings at <HI>Grays-Inn,</HI> where his <HI>loneness</HI> and <HI>desolate condition,</HI> wrought upon his <HI>ingenious,</HI> and therefore then more <HI>melancholy temper,</HI> that he pined away. And had this unhappiness after all his height of <HI>plenitude,</HI> to be denied Beer to quench his thirst: For having a sickly taste, he did not like the Beer of the house, but sent to Sir <HI>Fulk Grevil,</HI> Lord <HI>Brook,</HI> in neighborhood (now and then) for a bottle of his Beer, and after some grumbling, the <HI>Butler</HI> had order to deny him. So <HI>sordid</HI> was the one, that advanced himself to be called Sir <HI>Philip Sid|nie</HI>'s friend, and so friendless was the other, after he had dejected himself from what he was.</P>
<P>He was of a <HI>midling stature,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">His descrip|tion and cha|racter.</NOTE> his countenance had indented with <HI>Age</HI> before he was old; his <HI>Presence</HI> grave and comely; of a high-flying and lively <HI>Wit,</HI> striving in some things to be ra|ther admired than understood, yet so quick and easie where he would express himself, and his <HI>Memory</HI> so strong and active, that he appeared the <HI>Master</HI> of a large and plenteous <HI>store-house</HI> of <HI>Knowledge,</HI> being (as it were) <HI>Nature</HI>'s <HI>Midwife,</HI> stripping her <HI>Callow-brood,</HI> and clothing them in new <HI>Attire.</HI> His <HI>Wit</HI> was quick to the last; for <HI>Gondemar</HI> meeting him the <HI>Lent</HI> before his <HI>Censure,</HI> and hearing of his <HI>Miscarriages,</HI> thought to pay him with his <HI>Spanish Sarcasms</HI> and <HI>Scoffs,</HI> saying, <HI>My Lord, I wish you a good Easter; And you my Lord,</HI> replied the <HI>Chancellor, a good Pass|over</HI>: For he could neither close with his <HI>English Buffoonry,</HI> nor his <HI>Spanish Treaty</HI> (which <HI>Gondemar</HI> knew) though he was so wise as publickly to oppose neither. <HI>In fine, he was a fit Iewel to have beautified, and adorned a flourishing Kingdom, if his flaws had not disgraced the lustre that should have set him off.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="161" REF="154">In this very time of Parliament, when the King carried all things with a full sail, the <HI>Pilots</HI> of the Commonwealth had an eye to the dangers that lay in the way; for in both Houses the King had a strong Party, especially in the House of Lords: All the Courtiers, and most of the Bishops steer'd by his Compass, and the Princes presence (who was a constant <HI>Member</HI>) did cast an awe among many of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Parties in Par|liament.</NOTE> yet there were some gallant Spirits that aimed at the <HI>publick Liberty</HI> more then their own interest. If any thing were spoken in the House that did in the least reflect upon the Government, or touch (as the <HI>Courtiers</HI> thought) that <HI>Noli me tangere,</HI> the Prerogative, those that moved in it were snapt up by them, though many times they met with stout encounters at their own Weapon; among which the Principal were, <HI>Henry</HI> Earl of <HI>Oxford, Henry</HI> Earl of <HI>Southampton, Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Essex, Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> the Lord <HI>Say,</HI> the Lord <HI>Spencer,</HI> and divers others, that sup|ported the <HI>Old English Honour,</HI> and would not let it fall to the ground.</P>
<P><HI>Oxford</HI> was of no reputation in his youth, being very de|bauched and riotous, and having no means, maintained it by fordid and unworthy ways; for his Father hopeless of Heirs, in discontent with his Wife, squandred away a Princely <HI>Estate,</HI> but when she and his great <HI>Fortune</HI> were both gone, he married a young Lady of the ancient family of the <HI>Trenthams,</HI> by whom he had this young Lord, and two Daughters; she having a fortune of her own, and industry with it, after her Husband's death married her Daughters into two noble Families; the Earl of <HI>Mountgomery</HI> married the one, and the Lord <HI>Norris,</HI> after Earl of <HI>Berk-shire</HI> married the other: And finding her Son hope|less, let him run his swing till he grew weary of it; and think|ing he could not be worse in other Countries than he had been in his own, she sent him to travel, to try if change of <HI>Air</HI> would change his <HI>Humour.</HI> He was not abroad in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> above three years, and the freedoms and extravagancies there (that are able to betray and insnare the greatest <HI>mode|sties</HI>) put such a Bridle upon his inordinateness, that look how much before he was decried for a mean and poor <HI>spirit,</HI> so much had his noble and gallant comportment there gained, that he came over refined in every esteem; and such a Valua|tion was set upon his parts and merit, that he married the Lady <HI>Diana Cecil,</HI> Daughter to the Earl of <HI>Exeter,</HI> one of the most eminent Beauties and Fortunes of the time.</P>
<P><HI>Southampton,</HI> though he were one of the King's Privy Coun|cel, yet was he no great <HI>Courtier; Salisbury</HI> kept him at a bay, &amp; pinched him so by reason of his relation to old <HI>Essex,</HI> that he never flourished much in his time, nor was his <HI>spirit</HI> (after him) so smooth shod, as to go always the Court pace; but that
<PB N="162" REF="155">
now and then he would make a Carrier that was not very ac|ceptable to them: for he carried his business closely and slily, and was rather an Adviser than an Actor.</P>
<P><HI>Essex</HI> had ever an honest <HI>Heart,</HI> and though <HI>Nature</HI> had not given him <HI>Eloquence,</HI> he had a strong reason that did express him better; his Countenance to those that knew him not ap|peared somewhat stern, and <HI>solemn,</HI> to intimates affable and gentle, to the Females obligingly courteous, and though un|fortunate in some, yet highly respected of most, happily to vindicate the <HI>Vertue</HI> of the <HI>Sex.</HI> The King never affected him, whether from the bent of his <HI>Natural</HI> inclination to effeminate faces, or whether from that instinct or secret <HI>Prediction</HI> that <HI>Divine</HI> fate often imprints in the apprehension, whereby he did fore-see in him (as it were) a hand raised up against his <HI>Posterity,</HI> may be a <HI>Notation,</HI> not a determination: But the King never liked him, nor could he close with the Court.</P>
<P><HI>Warwick,</HI> though he had all those excellent indowments of Body and fortune, that gives splendor to a glorious <HI>Court,</HI> yet he used it but as his <HI>Recreation</HI>; for his Spirit aimed at more publick adventures, planting <HI>Colonies</HI> in the <HI>Western World,</HI> rather than himself in the King's favour: his Brother Sir <HI>Henry Rich</HI> (about this time made Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on of <HI>Kensington</HI>) and he had been in their youths two emulous <HI>Corrivals</HI> in the publick af|fections, the one's browness being accounted a lovely <HI>sweetness</HI> transcending most men, the other's features and pleasant <HI>aspect</HI> equalled the most beautiful Women; the younger having all the <HI>Dimensions</HI> of a Courtier, laid all the <HI>Stock</HI> of his <HI>Fortune</HI> upon that <HI>Soil,</HI> which after some years <HI>Patience</HI> came up with increase; but the Elder could not so stoop to observances, and thereby became his own Supporter.</P>
<P><HI>Saye</HI> and <HI>Seale</HI> was a seriously subtil <HI>Peece,</HI> and always averse to the Court ways, something out of pertinaciousness; his <HI>Temper</HI> and <HI>Constitution</HI> ballancing him altogether on that <HI>Side,</HI> which was contrary to the <HI>Wind</HI>; so that he seldom tackt about or went upright, though he kept his <HI>Course</HI> steady in his own way a long time: yet it appeared afterwards, when the harshness of the humour was a little allayed by the sweet <HI>Re|freshments</HI> of Court favours, that those stern <HI>Comportments</HI> sup|posed <HI>natural,</HI> might be mitigated, and that indomitable Spirits by gentle usage may be tamed and brought to obe|dience.</P>
<P><HI>Spencer</HI> (like the old <HI>Roman</HI> chosen <HI>Dictator</HI> from his <HI>Farm</HI>) made the Countrey a vertuous Court, where his Fields and Flocks brought him more calm and happy contentment, than the various and mutable dispensations of a Court can contribute: and when he was called to the Senate, was more vigilant to keep the Peoples Liberties from being a prey to

<P>About this time <HI>Spencer</HI> was speaking something in the House that their great Ancestors did,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Spencer</HI> and <HI>Arundel</HI> quar|rel.</NOTE> which displeased <HI>Arundel,</HI> and he cuts him off short, saying, <HI>My Lord, when these things you speak of were doing, your Ancestors were keeping sheep,</HI> (twitting him with his Flocks which he took delight in:) <HI>Spencer</HI> instantly replied, <HI>When my Ancestors (as you say) were keeping sheep, your Ancestors were plotting Treason.</HI></P>
<P>This hit <HI>Arundel</HI> home, and it grew to some heat in the House, whereupon they were separated, and commanded both out of the House, and the Lords began to consider of the of|fence. There was much bandying by the Court-<HI>Party,</HI> to ex|cuse the Earl of <HI>Arundel,</HI> but the heat and rash part of it be|ginning with him, laying such a brand upon a Peer that was nobly descended, he could not be justified, but was enjoyned by the House to give the Lord <HI>Spencer</HI> such satisfaction as they prescribed;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Arundel</HI> com|mitted.</NOTE> which his Greatness refusing to obey, he was by the <HI>Lords</HI> sent <HI>Prisoner</HI> to the <HI>Tower,</HI> and <HI>Spencer</HI> re-admitted into the House again.</P>
<P>When <HI>Arundle</HI> was well cooled in the <HI>Tower,</HI> and found that no Power would give him Liberty, but that which had re|strained him, (rather blaming his rashness, than excusing his stubborness) his great Heart humbled it self to the Lords, betwixt a Letter and a Petition in these words.</P>

<P>Thus this great Lord (though he fluttered in the <HI>Air</HI> of the <HI>Court,</HI> and mounted by that means upon the Wings of <HI>Passion</HI>) was glad to stoop when <HI>consideration</HI> lured him to it, lest by the heat that he himself made (melting the Waxen Plumes that he thought would have supported him) his suffering might have been a greater mischief to him than his submission: so sour and severe a School-master is <HI>Passion,</HI> to be both Author and Punisher of our <HI>Errors:</HI> yea, making the best Natures (often) correct themselves most.</P>

<P>The <HI>English</HI> in general,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The People and Parliament against the Match.</NOTE> except <HI>Papists,</HI> were averse to this <HI>Match,</HI> as boding some evil event, because the <HI>Papists</HI> did prune themselves, flutter up and down, and spread their <HI>Trains</HI> so publickly: This almost universal aversation of the people had a <HI>natural</HI> influence upon the <HI>Representative,</HI> the <HI>Par|liament</HI>; who considering that the King (by <HI>Digby</HI> and others) did inform them how <HI>formidable</HI> the King of <HI>Spain</HI> was, and did require them to apply themselves to the necessity of the Times, and further him with help to re-invest his Son in his <HI>Inheritance,</HI> thought there was no better means to be used than to try effectually the King's <HI>Spirit,</HI> and stir him up to a war; for so they should know which way their Money went, at leastwise his mind, before they tamely parted with it.

<P>VVE your Majestie's most humble and loyal Subjects,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Remon|strance of the House of Commons.</HI></NOTE> the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, now assembled in Par|liament, who represent the Commons of your Realm, full of hearty
<PB N="168" REF="159">
sorrow to be deprived of the <HI>Comfort</HI> of your <HI>Royal Presence,</HI> the ra|ther for that it proceeds from the want of your health, wherein We all unfainedly do suffer. In all humble manner calling to mind your gracious answer to our former <HI>Petition</HI> concerning <HI>Religion,</HI> which notwith|standing your <HI>Majesties</HI> pious and princely intentions, hath not produ|ced that good effect, which the danger of these <HI>Times</HI> doth seem to us to require. And finding how ill your Majesties goodness hath been requi|ted by <HI>Princes</HI> of different <HI>Religion,</HI> who even in time of Treaty, have taken opportunity to advance their own <HI>Ends,</HI> tending to the <HI>Subversion of Religion,</HI> and disadvantage of your affairs, and the <HI>Estate</HI> of your <HI>Children.</HI> By reason whereof your ill-affected Sub|jects at home, the <HI>Popish Recusants,</HI> have taken too much incourage|ment, and are dangerously increased in their <HI>Number,</HI> and in their insolencies. We cannot but be sensible thereof; And thereof humbly represent what we conceive to be the <HI>Causes</HI> of so great and growing <HI>Mischiefs,</HI> and what be the <HI>Remedies.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The Vigilancy and <HI>Ambition</HI> of the <HI>Pope</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> and his dearest Son, the one aiming at as large a Temporal <HI>Monarchy,</HI> as the other at a Spiritual <HI>Supremacy.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Devillish Positions,</HI> and <HI>Doctrines,</HI> whereon <HI>Popery</HI> is built, and taught, with authority to their Followers, for advancement of their Temporal Ends.</P>
<P N="3">3. The distressed, and miserable <HI>Estate</HI> of the <HI>Professors</HI> of true <HI>Religion</HI> in Foreign parts.</P>
<P N="4">4. The disastrous <HI>Accidents</HI> to your <HI>Majesties Children</HI> a|broad, expressed with rejoycing, and even with contempt of their <HI>Persons.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. The strange <HI>Confederacy</HI> of the <HI>Princes</HI> of the <HI>Popish Re|ligion,</HI> aiming mainly at the advancement of theirs, and subverting <HI>Ours,</HI> and taking the advantages conducing to that <HI>End,</HI> upon all <HI>Occasions.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. The great and many <HI>Armies</HI> raised and maintained at the charge of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> the chief of that <HI>League.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. The expectation of the <HI>Popish Recusants</HI> of the Match with <HI>Spain,</HI> and feeding themselves with great <HI>hopes</HI> of the consequences thereof.</P>
<P N="8">8. The interposing of Foreign <HI>Princes,</HI> and their <HI>Agents</HI> in the behalf of <HI>Popish Recusants,</HI> for connivence and favour un|to them.</P>
<P N="9">9. Their open and usual <HI>Resort</HI> to the <HI>Houses,</HI> and which is worse, to the <HI>Chappels</HI> of Foreign <HI>Ambassadors.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. Their more than usual concourse to the <HI>City,</HI> and their fre|quent <HI>Conventicles,</HI> and <HI>Conferences</HI> there.</P>
<P N="11">11. The education of their <HI>Children,</HI> in many several <HI>Semina|ries,</HI> and <HI>Houses</HI> of their <HI>Religion,</HI> in Foreign parts, appropriated only to the <HI>English Fugitives.</HI></P>
<P N="12"><PB N="169" REF="159">12. The Grants of their just forfeitures intended by your Majesty as a reward of <HI>service</HI> to the <HI>Grantees,</HI> but beyond your Majesties inten|tion, transferred or compounded for, at such mean rates as will amount to little less than a Toleration.</P>
<P N="13">13. The licentious printing and dispersing of <HI>Popish</HI> and <HI>seditious Books,</HI> even in the time of <HI>Parliament.</HI></P>
<P N="14">14. The <HI>Swarms</HI> of <HI>Priests</HI> and <HI>Jesuits,</HI> the common Incendiaries of all <HI>Christendom,</HI> dispersed in all parts of your Kingdom.</P>
<P>And from these <HI>Causes</HI> as bitter Roots, we humbly offer to your <HI>Majesty,</HI> that we foresee, and fear there will necessarily follow very dangerous effects both to <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>State.</HI> For,</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Popish Religion</HI> is incompatible with <HI>Ours</HI> in respect of their <HI>Positions.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. It draweth with it an unavoidable <HI>Dependency</HI> on foreign <HI>Princes.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. It openeth too wide a <HI>Gap</HI> for <HI>Popularity,</HI> to any who shall draw too great a <HI>Party.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. It hath a restless <HI>Spirit,</HI> and will strive by these <HI>Gradations</HI>; if it once get but a Connivence, it will press for a Toleration; if that should be obtained, they must have an equality; from thence they will aspire to <HI>Superiority</HI>: And will never rest till they get a <HI>Subversion</HI> of the true <HI>Religion.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Remedies</HI> against these growing <HI>Evils,</HI> which in all <HI>hum|bleness</HI> we offer to your most excellent <HI>Majesty,</HI> are these,</P>
<P N="1">1. That seeing this inevitable <HI>Necessity</HI> is faln upon your <HI>Ma|jesty,</HI> which no <HI>wisdom</HI> or <HI>providence</HI> of a peaceable and <HI>pious</HI> King, can avoid, your <HI>Majesty</HI> would not omit this just <HI>occasion,</HI> speedily and effectually to take your Sword into your hand.</P>
<P N="2">2. That once undertaken upon so Honourable and just grounds, your <HI>Majesty</HI> would resolve to persue, and more publickly avow the aiding of those of our <HI>Religion</HI> in foreign parts, which doubtless would reunite the <HI>Princes</HI> and <HI>States</HI> of the <HI>Union,</HI> by these disasters disheartned and disbanded.</P>
<P N="3">3. That <HI>your Majesty</HI> would propose to your self to manage this War with the best advantage, by a <HI>Diversion</HI> or otherwise, as in your deep <HI>judgment</HI> shall be found fittest, and not to rest upon a War in these parts only, which will consume your Treasure, and discourage your people.</P>
<P N="4">4. That the bent of this War, and point of your Sword may be against that <HI>Prince</HI> (whatsoever <HI>Opinion</HI> of <HI>Potency</HI> he hath) whose <HI>Armies</HI> and <HI>Treasures,</HI> have first diverted, and since maintained the War in the <HI>Palatinate.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. That for securing of our peace at home, your Majesty will be pleased to review the parts of our <HI>Petition</HI> formerly delivered unto your Majesty, and hereunto annexed, and to put it in execution; by the care of choice <HI>Commissioners,</HI> to be there unto especially appoint|ed, the <HI>Laws</HI> already, and hereafter, to be made for preventing of
<PB N="170" REF="160">
<HI>Dangers</HI> by <HI>Popish Recusants,</HI> and their wonted evasions.</P>
<P N="6">6. That to frustrate their hopes for a future <HI>Age,</HI> our most No|ble <HI>Prince</HI> may be timely and happily married to one of our own <HI>Religion.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. That the <HI>Children</HI> of the <HI>Nobility</HI> and <HI>Gentry</HI> of this King|dom, and of others ill affected, and suspected in their <HI>Religion,</HI> now beyond the Seas, may be forthwith called home by your <HI>means,</HI> and at the charge of their <HI>Parents</HI> or <HI>Governours.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. That the <HI>Children</HI> of <HI>Popish Recusants,</HI> or such whose wives are Popish Recusants, be brought up during their <HI>minority</HI> with <HI>Pro|testant Schoolmasters,</HI> and Teachers, who may sow in their tender years the seeds of true <HI>Religion.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. That your <HI>Majesty</HI> will be pleased speedily to revoke all former Licences, for such Children and youth to travel beyond the <HI>Seas,</HI> and not grant any such licence hereafter.</P>
<P N="10">10. That your Majesties learned <HI>Councel</HI> may receive com|mandment from your <HI>Highness,</HI> carefully to look into former <HI>Grants</HI> of <HI>Recusants</HI> lands, and to avoid them if by Law they can; and that your <HI>Majesty</HI> will stay your hand from passing any such <HI>Grants</HI> hereafter.</P>
<P>This is the sum and effect of our <HI>Humble Declaration,</HI> which we (no ways intending to press upon your <HI>Majesties</HI> undoubted and <HI>Regal Prerogative</HI>) do with the fulness of our <HI>Duty,</HI> and <HI>Obedience,</HI> humbly submit to your most <HI>Princely consideration,</HI> the <HI>Glory of God,</HI> whose <HI>Cause</HI> it is, the <HI>Zeal</HI> of our true <HI>Religion,</HI> in which we have been born, and wherein (by <HI>God's grace</HI>) we are resolved to die, the safety of your <HI>Majesties</HI> person, who is the very life of <HI>your people,</HI> the happiness of your <HI>Children</HI> and <HI>Posterity,</HI> the <HI>Honour</HI> and good of the <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>State</HI> dearer un|to us then our own lives, having kindled these <HI>Affections,</HI> truly devoted to your <HI>Majesty.</HI></P>
<P>And seeing out of our <HI>Duty</HI> to your <HI>Majesty,</HI> we have already resolved to give at the end of this <HI>Session</HI> one entire <HI>Subsidy,</HI> for the present relief of the <HI>Palatinate</HI> only, to be paid in the end of <HI>February</HI> next, which cannot well be effected but by passing a Bill in a <HI>Parliamentary course</HI> before <HI>Christmas</HI>; We most humbly beseech your <HI>Majesty</HI> (as our assured <HI>hope</HI> is) that you will then also vouchsafe to give life by your Royal assent, to such <HI>Bills</HI> as before that time shall be prepared for your <HI>Majesties Honour,</HI> and the general good of your <HI>People.</HI> And that such Bills may be also accompanied (as hath been ac|customed) with your <HI>Majestie</HI>'s gracious <HI>Pardon,</HI> which pro|ceeding from your own meer <HI>Grace,</HI> may by your <HI>Highness di|rection</HI> be drawn to that <HI>latitude,</HI> and extent, as may best sort. with your <HI>Majesties Bounty</HI> and <HI>Goodness.</HI> And that not only <HI>Fel|lons,</HI> and criminal offenders may take <HI>benefit</HI> thereof, but that your good <HI>Subjects</HI> may receive ease thereby. And if it shall so
<PB N="171" REF="160">
stand with your good pleasure, that it may extend to the re|lief of the old <HI>Debts</HI> and <HI>Duties</HI> to the <HI>Crown,</HI> before the first year of your <HI>Majesties</HI> raign, to the discharge of <HI>Alienations</HI> without licence, and misusing of <HI>Liveries</HI> and <HI>Oustre le main</HI> before the first <HI>summons</HI> of this <HI>Parliament</HI>; and of concealed <HI>Wardships,</HI> and not suing of <HI>Liveries</HI> and <HI>Oustre le mains,</HI> before the twelfth year of your Majesties <HI>Reign.</HI> Which gracious favour would much comfort your good <HI>Subjects,</HI> and ease them from <HI>Vexation,</HI> with little loss or prejudice to your own profit.</P>
<P>And we by our daily and devout prayers to the <HI>Almighty,</HI> the great King of Kings, shall contend for a blessing upon our endeavours, and for your <HI>Majesties</HI> long and happy Reign over Us, <HI>And for your Childrens children after you for many and many Generations.</HI></P>

<P>The King hearing that the House of Commons were ham|mering upon this <HI>Remonstrance,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King vext at it.</NOTE> went to <HI>Newmarket,</HI> a cold and bleak <HI>Air,</HI> in as cold and bleak a <HI>season,</HI> pretending his Health, but indeed to be further from the sound of that noise (which perpetually possessed his Ears) of the discontent of the <HI>Com|mons</HI> for the intended <HI>Match</HI> with <HI>Spain.</HI> And as the Business grew up, he had intimation of it from his <HI>creatures</HI> in the <HI>House</HI>; for it <HI>vext his Popish Secretary,</HI> Sir <HI>George Calvert, Weston,</HI> and others to find the <HI>House</HI> so bitter against their <HI>Profession,</HI> (though they were cunning <HI>Underminers,</HI> and put on a smooth face there) yet they aggravated the <HI>matter</HI> to the King with all the <HI>Acrimony</HI> they could, so far as to reflect upon particular <HI>persons,</HI> that were the most <HI>Active</HI> instruments in it.</P>
<P>And what is there in this <HI>Remonstrance</HI> (at such a time when the <HI>Protestant Religion</HI> was in danger of being extirpated) that put on so horrid a <HI>Vizard</HI> as to affright or exasperate the King?<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Protestant Religion in danger.</NOTE> The Emperor had prevailed in <HI>Germany,</HI> the <HI>Protestant Princes</HI> either <HI>subdued,</HI> or acquiesced, and laid down their <HI>necks</HI> to the <HI>Yoak.</HI> The <HI>Protestants</HI> were persecuted in <HI>France,</HI> be|sieged and ruined by the youthful <HI>fury</HI> of <HI>Lewis</HI> the 13. And notwithstanding <HI>Our King's solicitations</HI> by Sir <HI>Edward Herbert,</HI> since Baron of <HI>Cherbery,</HI> his Resident <HI>Ambassador</HI> there, who (after his <HI>conflict</HI> with <HI>Luynes</HI> the youthful <HI>Constable</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> and Favourite to that King) being sent for home, the <HI>Viscount Doncaster</HI> was sent again into <HI>France,</HI> upon one of his <HI>mediating</HI> imployments, who also followed that King from <HI>Camp</HI> to <HI>City,</HI> and from <HI>City</HI> to <HI>Camp,</HI> with as little success, this being no journey of <HI>Bravery,</HI> for it almost cost him his life there by a tedious sickness.</P>
<P><HI>Rochel</HI> and <HI>Montaban</HI> were besieged at one time this very year, <HI>Rochel</HI> by the <HI>Count</HI> of <HI>Soissons,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Guise,</HI>
<PB N="172" REF="161">
and <HI>Montaban</HI> by the King, a great distance one from another; but <HI>Doncaster</HI> could prevail for neither, yet the <HI>French</HI> King did not do his work. When man hath vented all his malice, he can go no further than the line God hath set him. <HI>One sad story</HI> intervenes which had a various Countenance, mixt with Bravery and Baseness,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hicks</HI> and <HI>Fairfax.</HI></NOTE> so that it was doubtful which was most prevalent. One <HI>Hicks</HI> an <HI>English-man</HI> undertook to carry a Letter from <HI>Rochel</HI> to <HI>Montaban,</HI> through both Armies, to let them know the good State and Condition of the <HI>Rochel|lers</HI> were in (maugre the fury and violence of their Enemies) that those of <HI>Montaban</HI> might be encouraged to hold out a|gainst the King's assaults. <HI>Hicks</HI> makes a clear passage through the Army before <HI>Rochell,</HI> and came to <HI>Thoulouse,</HI> where the Vis|count <HI>Doncaster</HI> was, there he consorted with the <HI>English,</HI> in|sinuating with a young <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> one <HI>Fairfax,</HI> of that noble Family in <HI>York-shire,</HI> who was for that journey one of the Lord Ambassador's Train, and <HI>Hicks</HI> finding him willing (being a young and gallant <HI>Spirit</HI>) to see the Kings Leagure at <HI>Mon|taban,</HI> they rode thither together, and under the <HI>notion</HI> of being of the Ambassador's retinue, they had free admittance to view all the Works, and Avenues. <HI>Hicks</HI> whose eye was fixt upon his opportunity to fly into the Town, made use of <HI>Fairfax</HI> to take his advantage with the least <HI>Suspicion,</HI> and in the instant of time, puts Spurs to his Horse, and got into the Town through a Shower of Bullets, leaving <HI>Fairfax</HI> (astonish'd at the attempt) to be wrackt and tormented to death (as he was by the <HI>French</HI> fury) to confess what he never knew; so that <HI>Hicks</HI> his Brave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y deserves a Brand of Infamy, and <HI>Fairfax</HI> his Innocency a memo|rial of <HI>pity.</HI> A noble Spirit must not dare to do a gallant action an unworthy way.</P>
<P>But our King's intentions aiming at Peace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our King a King of Peace.</NOTE> he took as he thought the best way to it, which was, to intreat for it: But that would not prevail, for the voice of intreaty cannot be heard for the Trumpet. In War, one noise must expel ano|ther. The Parliament saw the danger the Protestant Religion was in (<HI>For in many Councellors there is wisdom</HI>) and thought it their duties to let the King see how inclinable they were to support the falling Condition of it with their lives and for|tunes; But the King would be called <HI>Rex Pacificus</HI> to the last; His Heart was not advanced to glorious Atchievements, God will not (many times) make use of some men to do great things by them. The Parliament did not desire to make this a War for Religion only, though they saw it suppressed; for so all <HI>Popish Princes</HI> (which, was the King's fear) might have combined against him: But though the true end was Religion, the out|ward aim was to hinder the Progress of the victorious <HI>Spanish</HI> Power, which was likeliest to do most mischief.

Having (as it were) cast out one <HI>Anchor</HI> in a tempestuous <HI>season</HI> which would take no hold, they were forced to cast out another, that both toge|ther might better fasten on the King's good affections: There|fore they framed this following <HI>Petition,</HI> and sent the <HI>Remon|strance</HI> with it, hoping yet to save the beaten <HI>Bark</HI> of the <HI>Com|mon-wealth</HI> from ruin in so great a time of danger. And thus they address themselves to their great <HI>Pilot.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Most dread and gracious Soveraign,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia|ments Peti|tion.</HI></NOTE>WE your most humble and loyal <HI>Subjects,</HI> the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses assembled in the <HI>Commons House</HI> of <HI>Parlia|ment,</HI> full of grief and unspeakable sorrow, through the true sence of your Majesties displeasure expressed by your Letter lately sent to Our <HI>Speaker,</HI> and by him related and read unto <HI>Us</HI>; Yet comforted again with the assurance of your <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Goodness,</HI> and of the sincerity of our own intentions and proceedings, whereon with confidence we can rely, in all humbleness beseech your most excellent <HI>Majesty,</HI> that the <HI>Loyalty</HI> and <HI>Dutifulness</HI> of as faithful and loving <HI>Subjects</HI> as ever served or lived under a gracious <HI>Soveraign,</HI> may not undeser|vedly suffer, by the mis-information of partial and uncertain <HI>Re|ports,</HI> which are ever unfaithful <HI>Intelligencers</HI>: but that your <HI>Majesty</HI> would in the clearness of your own <HI>Judgment,</HI> first vouch|sase to understand from <HI>Our selves,</HI> and not from others, what our humble <HI>Declaration</HI> and <HI>Petition</HI> (resolved upon by the Universal Voice of the <HI>House,</HI> and proposed with your <HI>Gracious</HI> favour to be presented unto your <HI>Sacred Majesty</HI>) doth contain. Upon what <HI>Oc|casion</HI> we entred into <HI>Consideration</HI> of those things which are there|in contained, with what dutiful respect to your Majesty, and your Ser|vice, we did consider thereof, and what was our true intention there|by. And that when your <HI>Majesty</HI> shall thereby truly discern our dutiful <HI>Affections,</HI> you will in your <HI>Royal</HI> judgment free us from those heavy <HI>Charges</HI> wherewith some of our <HI>Members</HI> are burthened, and wherein the whole <HI>House</HI> is involved.</P>
<P>And we humbly beseech your <HI>Majesty,</HI> that you will not hereafter give <HI>Credit</HI> to private <HI>Reports</HI> against all, or any of the Members of our <HI>House,</HI> whom the whole have not <HI>censured,</HI> until your <HI>Majesty</HI> have been truly informed thereof from our selves, and that in the mean
<PB N="175" REF="163">
time, and ever, we may stand upright in your Majesties <HI>Grace</HI> and good <HI>Opinion,</HI> than which no <HI>worldly consideration</HI> is, or can be dearer unto us.</P>
<P>When your Majesty had reassembled us in <HI>Parliament,</HI> by your <HI>Royal Commandment,</HI> sooner than we expected, and did vouchsafe by the <HI>mouths</HI> of three honourable <HI>Lords,</HI> to impart unto us the weighty <HI>occasions</HI> moving your Majesty thereunto; And from them we did understand these particulars.</P>
<P>That notwithstanding your Princely and <HI>Pious</HI> indeavours to pro|cure <HI>Peace,</HI> the time is now come that <HI>Janus Temple</HI> must be opened.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Voice of Bellona</HI> must be heard, and not the Voice of the <HI>Turtle.</HI></P>
<P>That there was no hope of <HI>Peace,</HI> nor any Truce to be obtained, no, not for a few days.</P>
<P>That your Majesty must either abandon your own <HI>Children,</HI> or in|gage your self in a war, wherein <HI>Consideration</HI> is to be had, what foot, what horse, what money would be sufficient.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Lower Palatinate</HI> was seized upon by the Army of the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> as <HI>Executor</HI> of the <HI>Ban</HI> there, in quality of Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> as the <HI>Upper Palatinate</HI> was by the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Ba|varia.</HI></P>
<P>That the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> at his own <HI>Charge</HI> had now at least five several <HI>Armies</HI> on foot.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Princes</HI> of the <HI>Union</HI> were disbanded, but the <HI>Catho|lick</HI> league remained firm, whereby those <HI>Princes</HI> so dissevered, were in danger one by one to be ruined.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Estate</HI> of those of the <HI>Religion</HI> in Foreign <HI>parts</HI> was mi|serable. And,</P>
<P>That out of these <HI>Considerations</HI> we were called to a war, and forthwith to advise for a <HI>Supply,</HI> for keeping the <HI>forces</HI> in the <HI>Pa|latinate</HI> from disbanding, and to fore-see the means for raising and maintaining the body of an <HI>Army</HI> for the war against the <HI>Spring.</HI> We therefore out of our <HI>Zeal</HI> to your <HI>Majesty</HI> and your <HI>Posterity,</HI> with more alacrity, and colerity, than ever was precedented in <HI>Par|liament</HI>; did address our selves to the <HI>Service</HI> commended unto <HI>Us.</HI> And although we cannot conceive, that the honor and safety of your Majesty, and your <HI>posterity,</HI> the <HI>patrimony</HI> of your <HI>Children,</HI> in|vaded and possessed by their <HI>Enemies,</HI> the welfare of <HI>Religion,</HI> and <HI>State</HI> of your Kingdom, are matters at any time unfit for our deepest <HI>consideration</HI> in time of <HI>Parliament.</HI> And though before this time we were in some of these points silent, yet being now invited thereun|to, and led on by so just an <HI>occasion,</HI> we thought it <HI>Our Duties</HI> to pro|vide for the present supply thereof, and not only to turn our eyes on a war abroad; but to take care for the securing of our <HI>peace</HI> at home, which the dangerous increase, and insolency of <HI>Popish Recusants,</HI> ap|parently, visibly, and sensibly did lead us unto. The consideration
<PB N="176" REF="164">
whereof did necessarily draw us truly to represent unto your <HI>Majesty what we conceive</HI> to be the <HI>Causes,</HI> what we feared would be the effects, and what we hoped might be the remedies of these growing <HI>Evils.</HI> Among which, as incident and unavoidable, we fell upon some things which seem to touch upon the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> as they have re|lation to <HI>Popish Recusants</HI> at home, to the Wars by him maintained in the <HI>Palatinate</HI> against your <HI>Majestie's Children,</HI> and to his seve|ral <HI>Armies</HI> now on foot; yet as we conceived without touch of <HI>dis|honour</HI> to that King, or any other <HI>Prince</HI> your <HI>Majestie's Conse|derate.</HI></P>
<P>In the discourse whereof we did not assume to our <HI>selves</HI> any power to determin of any part thereof,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An humble Parliament.</HI></NOTE> nor intend to incroach or intrude upon the <HI>Sacred bounds of your Royal Authority,</HI> to whom, and to whom only, we acknowledg it doth belong to resolve of <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>War,</HI> and of the <HI>Marriage</HI> of the most noble <HI>Prince</HI> your <HI>Son.</HI> But as your most <HI>Loyal</HI> and humble <HI>Subjects,</HI> and <HI>Servants,</HI> representing the whole <HI>Commons</HI> of your <HI>Kingdom</HI> (who have a large inte|rest in the happy and prosperous estate of your <HI>Majesty,</HI> and your <HI>Royal Posterity,</HI> and of the flourishing <HI>Estate</HI> of our <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>Common-wealth</HI>) did resolve out of our Cares and Fears, truly and plainly to demonstrate these things to your <HI>Majesty,</HI> which we were not assured could otherwise come so fully and clearly to your know|ledg, and that being done, to lay the same down at your Majesties <HI>feet,</HI> without expectation of any other answer of your Majesty touching these higher points, than what at your good pleasure, and in your own time should be held fit.</P>
<P>This being the effect of that we had formerly resolved upon, and these the occasions and reasons inducing the same, our humble suit to your <HI>Majesty,</HI> and confidence is, that your <HI>Majesty</HI> will be graciously pleased to receive at the hands of these our <HI>Messengers</HI> our former humble <HI>Declaration,</HI> and <HI>Petition,</HI> and to vouchsafe to read, and favourably to interpret the same. And that to so much thereof, as containeth our humble <HI>Petition</HI> concerning <HI>Jesuits, Priests</HI> and <HI>Po|pish Recusants,</HI> the passage of <HI>Bills,</HI> and granting your <HI>Royal Par|don,</HI> you will vouchsafe an answer unto us.</P>
<P>And whereas your <HI>Majesty</HI> by the general words of your Letter seemeth to restrain us from intermedling with matters of <HI>Govern|ment,</HI> or <HI>particulars</HI> which have their <HI>motion</HI> in the <HI>Courts</HI> of <HI>Justice</HI>; the generality of which words in the largeness of the extent thereof, (as we hope beyond your <HI>Majesties</HI> intention) might involve those things, which are the proper <HI>Subjects</HI> of <HI>Parliamentary</HI> occa|sions and discourse.</P>
<P>And where as your <HI>Majesty</HI> doth seem to abridge us of the ancient <HI>liberty</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> for freedom of <HI>Speech, Jurisdiction,</HI> and just <HI>Censure</HI> of the House, and other proceedings there (wherein we trust in God we shall never transgress the <HI>bounds</HI> of <HI>loyal</HI> and <HI>duti|ful Subjects</HI>) a liberty which we assure our selves so wise and so
<PB N="177" REF="164">
just a <HI>King</HI> will not infringe, the same being our ancient and un|doubted right, and an inheritance received from our <HI>Ancestors,</HI> with|out which we cannot freely debate, nor clearly discern of things in <HI>Question</HI> before us, nor truly inform your <HI>Majesty</HI>; in which we have been confirmed by your <HI>Majesties</HI> most gracious former Speeches and Messages: We are therefore now again inforced in all humble|ness to pray your Majesty to allow the same, and thereby to take a|way the <HI>doubts</HI> and <HI>scruples</HI> your Majesties late Letter to your <HI>Spea|ker</HI> hath brought upon us.</P>
<P>So shall we your <HI>Loyal</HI> and loving <HI>Subjects</HI> ever acknowledge your Majesties <HI>justice,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And a Pious.</HI></NOTE> <HI>grace</HI> and <HI>goodness,</HI> and be ready to perform that service to your Majesty, which in the true affection of our hearts we prosess, and powre out our dayly and devout <HI>prayers</HI> to the <HI>Al|mighty</HI> for your Majesties long life, happy and religious Reign, and prosperous <HI>Estate,</HI> and for your <HI>Royal posterity after you for ever.</HI></P>
</LETTER></P>
<P>The <HI>Parliament</HI> thought it strange that the King in a <HI>Recess</HI> should call them together before the appointed time of meet|ing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King wan|ted money, not advice.</NOTE> pretending <HI>Emergent occasions,</HI> and (by his <HI>Ministers</HI> of <HI>State</HI>) persuade and incite to a War, and when (in obedience to this command) they shall proceed in their advice, only to prevent the dangers abroad, and establish <HI>security</HI> at home, they shall be accounted presumptuous and insolent. But by this they discover, (and which the King plainly expresses in his Answer) that he required none of their advice, he wanted only their <HI>money,</HI> if they had furnished him with that instead of <HI>Counsel,</HI> it would have been a golden <HI>Remonstrance.</HI> They are to be his <HI>Bank,</HI> his <HI>Merchants,</HI> he needs no other directions; let them find money, he knows how to dispose of it. This was the great fault, which this <HI>Petition</HI> strives to <HI>mitigate,</HI> ac|companied with the Remonstrance it self, and the <HI>Petition</HI> a|gainst <HI>Recusancy,</HI> for both which it was an intercessor, but it could not with all its Humility procure acceptance for its <HI>Com|panions,</HI> though sent by twelve select <HI>Members</HI> of the <HI>House,</HI> and the leading <HI>man</HI> Sir <HI>Richard Weston</HI> (who was really the King's) chosen by the <HI>Commons</HI> to make their <HI>Petitions</HI> the more accep|table. And the House finding it a great discouragement to them to proceed in any business, when there was so great a distance betwixt the <HI>King</HI> and them, (the <HI>King</HI> thinking their <HI>actions</HI> an intrenchment upon his <HI>Prerogative,</HI> and they think|ing the King's expressions an infringement of their Liberties) they resolved to give over all business, till they had an An|swer of their <HI>Petitions</HI>; for they thought they had as good do nothing, as have that they do undone again. Which the <HI>King</HI> hearing of was <HI>vexed</HI> at the <HI>heart,</HI> and entertained their <HI>Messen|gers</HI> very roughly; and some say he called for twelve <HI>Chaire's</HI>
<PB N="178" REF="165">
for them, saying, Here are twelve <HI>Kings</HI> come to me. But after he had considered their desires in their last <HI>Petition</HI> (rejecting the others) he returns them this answer to all.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An. Christi.</HI> 1621.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>WE must here begin in the same fashion that we would have done, if your first</HI> Petition <HI>had come to our Hands&punc; before we had made a stay thereof,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King's Answer.</HI></NOTE> <HI>which is to repeat the first words of the late</HI> Queen <HI>of famous</HI> memory, <HI>used by her in answer to an insolent</HI> Proposition, <HI>made by a</HI> Polonian Embassadon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>unto her, that is</HI> Legatum expectabamus, Heraldum accipimus. <HI>For we had great</HI> reason <HI>to expect that the first</HI> Message <HI>from your House should have been a</HI> Message <HI>of thanksgiving for</HI> Our <HI>continued</HI> gratious beha|viour <HI>towards our</HI> People <HI>since your last</HI> Recess. <HI>Not only by our</HI> Proclamation <HI>of</HI> Grace, <HI>wherein were contained six or seven and thirty</HI> Articles, <HI>all of several points of</HI> Grace <HI>to the people; but al|so by the labour we took for the</HI> satisfaction <HI>of both</HI> Houses <HI>in those three</HI> Articles <HI>recommended unto</HI> Us <HI>in both their names by the right</HI> Reverend <HI>Father in</HI> God <HI>the</HI> Archbishop <HI>of</HI> Canterbury, <HI>and likewise for the good Government of</HI> Ireland <HI>we are now in hand with at your request. But not only have</HI> We <HI>heard no news of all this, but contrary, great complains of the</HI> Danger <HI>of</HI> Religion <HI>within this Kingdom, tacitly implying</HI> Our <HI>ill Government in this point. And we leave you to judge, whether it be your</HI> Duties, <HI>that are the</HI> Representative Body <HI>of</HI> Our People, <HI>so to distate them with</HI> Our Government, <HI>whereas by the contrary, it is your</HI> Duty <HI>with all your indeavours to kindle more and more a dutiful and thankful</HI> Love <HI>in the peoples</HI> hearts <HI>towards us for our just and gra|cious Government.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Now whereas in the very beginning of this your</HI> Apology, <HI>you tax</HI> Us <HI>in fair terms of trusting uncertain</HI> Reports, <HI>and partial infor|mations concerning your</HI> Proceedings; <HI>We wish you to remember that we are an</HI> old <HI>and experienced</HI> King, <HI>needing no such lessons, being in our conscience, freest of any King alive from hearing or tru|sting idle</HI> Reports, <HI>which so many of your House as are nearest</HI> Us, <HI>can bear witness unto you, if you would give as good ear to them, as you do to some</HI> Tribunitial Orators <HI>among you. And for proof in this particular: We have made your own</HI> Messengers <HI>confer your o|ther</HI> Petitions <HI>sent by you with the</HI> Copy <HI>thereof, which was sent</HI> Us <HI>before, between which there is no difference at all, but that since our receiving the first</HI> Copy, <HI>you added a</HI> Conclusion <HI>unto it, which could not come to our hands, till it was done by you, and your</HI> Messen|gers <HI>sent, which was all at one time. And if we had had no</HI> Copy <HI>of it before hand, we must have received your first</HI> Petition <HI>to our</HI> great dishonour, <HI>before we had known what it contained, which would have inforced us to have returned you a far worse answer than now</HI> we <HI>do. For then your</HI> Messengers <HI>had returned with</HI> nothing, <HI>but that</HI> We <HI>have judged your</HI> Petition <HI>unlawful and unworthy of an answer:
<PB N="179" REF="165">
For as to your</HI> Conclusion <HI>thereof, it is nothing but</HI> Protestatio con|traria facto, <HI>for in the body of your</HI> Petition <HI>you usurp upon</HI> Our <HI>Prerogative</HI> Royal, <HI>and meddle with things far above your reach, and then in the</HI> Conclusion <HI>you protest the contrary; as if a</HI> Rob|ber <HI>would take a mans purse, and then protest he meant not to rob him. For first you presume to give</HI> Us <HI>your advice concerning the</HI> Match <HI>of</HI> Our <HI>dearest</HI> Son <HI>with some</HI> Protestant, <HI>we cannot say</HI> Princess, <HI>for we know none of these fit for him, and dissuade us from his</HI> Match <HI>with</HI> Spain, <HI>urging us to a present</HI> War <HI>with that</HI> King, <HI>and yet in the</HI> conclusion, <HI>forsooth, ye protest ye intend not to press upon our most undoubted and</HI> Regal Prerogative; <HI>as if the</HI> peti|tioning <HI>of</HI> Us <HI>in</HI> matters <HI>that your selves confess ye ought not to meddle with, were not a medling with them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And whereas ye pretend that ye were invited to this course by the</HI> Speeches <HI>of three honourable</HI> Lords, <HI>ye thy so much as your selves re|peat of the</HI> Speeches, <HI>nothing can be concluded, but that</HI> We <HI>were re|solved by</HI> War <HI>to regain the</HI> Palatinate, <HI>if otherwise</HI> We <HI>could not attain unto it. And you were invited to advise forthwith upon a</HI> Sup|ply <HI>for keeping the</HI> Forces <HI>in the</HI> Palatinate <HI>from disbanding, and to fore-see the means for the raising and maintaining of the</HI> Body <HI>of an</HI> Army <HI>for that War against the</HI> Spring. <HI>Now what inference can be made upon this? That therefore we must presently denounce War against the</HI> King of Spain, <HI>break our dearest Son's</HI> Match, <HI>and</HI> Match <HI>him to one of</HI> Our Religion, Let the world judge! <HI>The difference is no greater, than if we would tell a</HI> Merchant <HI>that</HI> We <HI>had great</HI> need <HI>to borrow</HI> money <HI>from him for raising an</HI> Army, <HI>that thereupon it should follow, that</HI> We <HI>were bound to follow his advice in the</HI> Directions <HI>of the</HI> War, <HI>and all things depending thereupon But yet not contenting your</HI> Selves <HI>with this excuse of yours, which indeed cannot hold</HI> water, <HI>ye come after to a direct</HI> contradiction <HI>to the</HI> conclusion <HI>of your former</HI> Petition, <HI>saying, that the</HI> Honor <HI>and</HI> Safety <HI>of</HI> Us <HI>and</HI> Our posterity, <HI>and the</HI> patrimony <HI>of</HI> our Children <HI>invaded, and possessed by their</HI> Enemies, <HI>the</HI> welfare <HI>of</HI> Religion, <HI>and</HI> State <HI>of</HI> Our Kingdom, are matters at any time not unfit for your deepest considerations in Parliament. <HI>To this</HI> generality, We answer <HI>with the</HI> Logicians, That where all things are contained, nothing is omitted. <HI>So as this</HI> plenipotency <HI>of yours invests you in all</HI> power <HI>upon</HI> Earth, <HI>lacking nothing but the</HI> Popes <HI>to have the</HI> Keyes <HI>also both of</HI> Heaven <HI>ahd</HI> Purgatory. <HI>And to this</HI> vast <HI>generality of yours, we can give no other Answer; for it will trouble all the best</HI> Lawyers <HI>in the</HI> House, <HI>to make a good</HI> Commentary <HI>upon it. For so did the</HI> Puritan Ministers <HI>in</HI> Scot|land, <HI>bring all kind of</HI> Causes <HI>within the</HI> compass <HI>of their</HI> Ju|risdiction, <HI>saying, That it was the</HI> Churches Office <HI>to judge of</HI> Slander, <HI>and there could no kind of</HI> crime <HI>or</HI> fault <HI>be committed, but there was a</HI> slander <HI>in it, either against</HI> God, <HI>the</HI> King, <HI>or their</HI> Neighbour, <HI>and by this means they hooked into themselves the

too fair a ground, and opened them too Wide a</HI> Gate, <HI>for Curbing and</HI> oppressing <HI>of many thousands of our</HI> Religion <HI>in divers parts of</HI> Christendom.</P>
<P><HI>And whereas you excuse your touching upon the King of</HI> Spain, <HI>upon occasion of the incidents by you repeated in that place, and yet affirm that it is without any touch to his</HI> Honour, <HI>We cannot wonder enough that ye are so forgetful, both of your</HI> Words <HI>and</HI> Writs: <HI>For in your former Petition ye plainly affirm, that he affects the Tem|poral</HI> Monarchy <HI>of the whole Earth, then which there can be no more</HI> malice <HI>uttered against any great King, to make all other</HI> Princes <HI>and</HI> Potentates <HI>both envie and hate him. But if ye list, it may be easily tried, whether that</HI> Speech <HI>touched him in</HI> Honour <HI>or not: if we shall ask him the</HI> Question, <HI>whether he means to assume to himself that Title or no? For every King can best judge of his own</HI> Honour. <HI>We omit the</HI> particular <HI>ejaculations of some foul mou|thed</HI> Orators <HI>in your</HI> House, <HI>against the</HI> Honour <HI>of his</HI> Crown <HI>and</HI> State.</P>
<P><HI>And touching your excuse of not determining any thing concerning the</HI> Match <HI>of our dearest</HI> Son, <HI>but only to tell your</HI> opinions, <HI>and lay it down at Our feet: First, We desire to know how you could have presumed to determin in that</HI> point <HI>without</HI> Committing of high Treason. <HI>And next you cannot deny, but your talking of his</HI> Match <HI>after that manner, was a direct</HI> breach <HI>of</HI> Our commandment, <HI>and</HI> Declaration <HI>out of</HI> Our own mouth, <HI>at the first sitting down of this</HI> Parliament; <HI>where we plainly professed, that we were in treaty of his</HI> Match <HI>with</HI> Spain, <HI>and wished you to have that</HI> Con|fidence in our Religion, <HI>and</HI> Wisdom, <HI>that We would so manage it as</HI> Our Religion <HI>should receive no</HI> prejudice <HI>by it. And the same We now repeat unto you, professing that We are so far enga|ged in that</HI> March, <HI>as we cannot in</HI> Honour <HI>go back, except the King of</HI> Spain <HI>perform not such things as we expect at his hands: And therefore We are sorry that ye should shew to have so great</HI> Di|strust <HI>in Us, or to conceive that We should be cold in our</HI> Religion: <HI>otherwise We cannot imagine how Our former public</HI> Declaration <HI>should not have stopt your</HI> mouths <HI>in this</HI> point.</P>
<P><HI>And as to your Request, That We would now receive your former</HI> Petition, <HI>We wonder what could make you</HI> presume, <HI>that We would not receive it; whereas in our former Letter, We plainly declared the</HI> Contrary <HI>unto you, and therefore we have justly rejected that</HI> suit <HI>of yours. For what have you left un-attempted in the</HI> Highest points of Soveraignty in that Petition of yours, <HI>except the striking of</HI> Coin? <HI>For it contains the violation of Leagues, the</HI> particular <HI>way how to govern a</HI> War, <HI>and the</HI> Marriage <HI>of our dearest Son, both Negative with</HI> Spain, <HI>nay with any other</HI> Popish Princess. <HI>And also Affirmatively, as to the Matching with one of</HI> Our <HI>Religion; which</HI> We confess is a strain beyond any Providence or Wisdom God hath given Us, as things now stand.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="167"><HI>These are unfit things to be handled in</HI> Parliament, <HI>except your King should require it of you,</HI> For who can have Wisdom to judge of things of that Nature? but such as are daily acquain|ted with the particulars of Treaties, <HI>and of the Variable or fixed Connexion of</HI> Affairs of State, <HI>together with the knowledge of the secret ways, ends, and intentions of</HI> Princes, <HI>in their</HI> several Ne|gotiations: <HI>otherwise a small mistaking in matters of this</HI> Nature <HI>may produce more effects than can be imagined. And therefore</HI> Ne|sutor ultra crepidam. <HI>And besides the intermedling in</HI> Parlia|ment <HI>with</HI> matters <HI>of</HI> Peace, <HI>or</HI> War, <HI>and Marriage of Our dearest Son, would be such a diminution to Us, and to</HI> Our Crown <HI>in forraign Countries, as would make any</HI> Prince <HI>neglect to treat with Us, either in</HI> matters <HI>of</HI> Peace <HI>or</HI> Marriage, <HI>except they might be assured by the assent of</HI> Parliament.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>False play just|ly rewarded.</HI></NOTE> <HI>And so it proved long ago with a King of</HI> France, <HI>who upon a trick procuring his</HI> States <HI>to dissent from some</HI> Treaty, <HI>which before he had made; was after refused treating with any other</HI> Princes, <HI>to his great reproach, unless he would first procure the</HI> Assent <HI>of his</HI> Estates <HI>to their</HI> Proposition. <HI>And will you cast your eyes upon the late</HI> Times, <HI>you shall find that the late</HI> Queen <HI>of</HI> Famous memory, <HI>was humbly</HI> petitioned <HI>by a</HI> Parliament <HI>to be pleased to marry: But her Answer was, that she liked their</HI> petition <HI>well, because it was simple, not limiting her to place or</HI> person, <HI>as not besitting her liking to their</HI> Fancies; <HI>and if they had done otherwise, she would have thought it a high presumption in them.</HI> Judge then what We may do in such a Case? <HI>having made our public</HI> Declaration <HI>already (as we said before) directly contrary to that which you have now petitioned.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Now to the</HI> points <HI>in your</HI> Petition, <HI>whereof you desire an answer as properly belonging to the</HI> Parliament. <HI>The first and the greatest</HI> point <HI>is that of</HI> Religion, <HI>concerning which at this time We can give you no other answer than in the</HI> General; <HI>which is, that you may rest secure, that We will never be weary to do all we can for the</HI> propagation <HI>of</HI> Our Religion, <HI>and repressing of</HI> Popery. <HI>But the manner and form you must remit to</HI> Our <HI>care and providence, who can best consider of</HI> Times <HI>and</HI> Seasons; <HI>not by undertaking a pub|lic War of</HI> Religion <HI>through all the</HI> World <HI>at once; which, how hard and dangerous a task it may prove, you may judge. But this puts Us in mind how all the</HI> World <HI>complained the last year of plenty of</HI> Corn, <HI>and</HI> God hath sent Us a cooling Card <HI>this year for that heat. And so</HI> We <HI>pray</HI> God <HI>that this desire among you of Kindling</HI> Wars (<HI>shewing your weariness of</HI> Peace <HI>and</HI> Plenty) <HI>may not make God permit Us to fall into the</HI> miseries <HI>of both.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Wars good to prevent wars.</HI></NOTE> <HI>But as we already said,</HI> Our care of Religion <HI>must be such, as on the one part We must not by the hot persecution of</HI> Our Recusants <HI>at home, irritate forrain</HI> Princes <HI>of contrary</HI> Religion, <HI>and teach them the way to plague the</HI> Protestants <HI>in their</HI> Dominions, <HI>whom with We dayly intercede, and at this time principally for ease to them of Our</HI>

profession, <HI>that live under them. Yet upon the other part, We never mean to spare from due and severe</HI> punishment <HI>any</HI> Papist <HI>that will grow insolent, for living under</HI> Our <HI>so mild</HI> Government. <HI>And you may also be assured, We will leave no</HI> Care <HI>untaken, as well for the good</HI> Education <HI>of the youth at home, especially the</HI> Children <HI>of</HI> Papists, <HI>as also for preserving at all times hereafter the youth that are or shall be abroad, from being bred in dangerous places, and so poisoned in</HI> Popish Seminaries. <HI>And as in this</HI> point, <HI>namely, con|cerning the good</HI> Education <HI>of</HI> Popish <HI>youth at</HI> Home, <HI>We have already given some good proofs both in this Kingdom, and in</HI> Ire|land, <HI>so will We be well pleased to pass any good</HI> Laws <HI>that shall be made, either now, or any time hereafter to this purpose.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And as to your request of making this a</HI> Session, <HI>and granting a general</HI> pardon, <HI>it shall be in your</HI> Defaults, <HI>if We make not this a</HI> Session <HI>before</HI> Christmas.</P>
<P><HI>But for the</HI> Pardon, <HI>ye crave such particulars in it, as We must be well advised upon, lest otherwise we give you back the double or tre|ble of that we are to receive by your entire</HI> Subsidy, <HI>without</HI> Fif|teens. <HI>But the ordinary course</HI> We hold <HI>fittest to be used still in this</HI> Case, <HI>is, that</HI> We should of our free grace <HI>send you down a</HI> Pardon <HI>from the higher</HI> House, <HI>containing such points as We shall think fittest, wherein we hope ye shall receive good satisfaction.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But</HI> We <HI>cannot omit to shew you how strange we think it, that ye should make so bad and unjust a Commentary upon some words of our former Letter, as if we meant to restrain you thereby of your ancient</HI> privileges <HI>and liberties in</HI> Parliament. <HI>Truly a</HI> Scholler <HI>would be ashamed so to misplace, and mis-judge any</HI> Sentences <HI>in another Mans book. For whereas in the end of our former Letter</HI> We <HI>discharge you to meddle with matters of</HI> Government <HI>and</HI> Mysteries <HI>of</HI> State, <HI>namely, Matters of</HI> War <HI>or</HI> Peace, <HI>or our dearest Sons</HI> Match <HI>with</HI> Spain; <HI>by which particular denominations,</HI> We <HI>in|terpret, and restrain</HI> Our <HI>former</HI> words: <HI>And then after</HI> We <HI>for|bid you to meddle with such things as have their</HI> Ordinary <HI>course in</HI> Courts of Justice: <HI>yet couple together those two distinct</HI> Sentences, <HI>and plainly leave out these words,</HI> Of Mysteries of State; <HI>so as ye err</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&agrave;ben&egrave; divisis ad mal&egrave; conjecta. <HI>For of the former part concerning</HI> Mysteries of State, We <HI>plainly restrained our meaning to the</HI> particulars <HI>that were after mentioned. And in the latter we confess we meant it by Sir</HI> Edward Cook's <HI>foolish business. And therefore it had well become him, especially being</HI> Our Servant, <HI>and One of</HI> Our Consel <HI>to have complained unto Us, which he never did, though he was ordinarily at Court since, and never had access re|fused unto him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And although</HI> We <HI>cannot allow of the</HI> stile, <HI>calling it,</HI> Your Ancient and undoubted right and inheritance, <HI>but could rather have wished that ye had said,</HI> That your Privileges were deri|ved from the Grace, and permission of our Ancestors and
<PB N="184" REF="168">
Us <HI>(for most of them grow from</HI> Precedents, <HI>which shews rather a toleration than inheritance) yet we are pleased to give you</HI> Our Royal <HI>assurance, that as long as you shall contain your</HI> selves <HI>within the limits of your</HI> Duty, <HI>we will be as careful to maintain, and preserve your lawful Liberties and Privileges, as ever any of</HI> Our Predecessors <HI>were; nay, as to preserve</HI> Our own Royal Prerogative. <HI>So as your House shall only have need to beware to trench upon the</HI> Prerogative <HI>of the</HI> Crown; <HI>which would enforce Us, or any just King to retrench them of their</HI> Privileges <HI>that would pare his</HI> Prerogative <HI>and Flowers of the</HI> Crown. <HI>But of this</HI> We <HI>hope there shall be never cause given.</HI> This was the effect of the King's Answer, which was dated at <HI>New-market</HI> the 11. of <HI>De|cember</HI> 1621.</P>
<P>Thus the King acted his part, and though his answer might be the Result of his thoughts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King and People Com|petitors.</NOTE> yet it was some transcendent Cause that put it into <HI>Words,</HI> for his <HI>Nature</HI> was apt enough to fear the <HI>Sound</HI> of its own impressions. But now his <HI>Spirit</HI> was mounted, either the Breach of the Treaty with <HI>Spain,</HI> or the Breach (as he thought) upon his <HI>Prerogative</HI> gave wing, to raise his <HI>Anger</HI> higher than his fear. <HI>Princes</HI> that never knew how to obey, ride their <HI>Passions</HI> with a loose rein, and are easiest carried by that impulsion. The <HI>Prince</HI> and the <HI>People</HI> are here <HI>Competitors,</HI> both jealous of encroachments, both striving to prevent them. <HI>Liberty</HI> is a power that gives a well being, and life to the <HI>People. Power</HI> is a liberty that <HI>Princes</HI> take to be the very life of their <HI>Being.</HI> Kings are like the <HI>Sea,</HI> and the people like the land, the industry of the one striving with the <HI>Piles,</HI> and <HI>Banks</HI> of good laws, and <HI>Precedents,</HI> to bound the often-spring|tides, and over-flowing of the other. In <HI>Scotland</HI> the Land was high, Rocky, and inaccessible for his <HI>Waves</HI> though never so boisterous; Here he finds a smooth <HI>Shore,</HI> and the people as tame in their obedience, as they were in their sufferings, which makes him the bolder with them.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Parliament</HI> (weighing the King's answer by the <HI>Bal|lance</HI> of <HI>Reason,</HI> not <HI>Passion</HI>) found that there was little for them to do.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Discourses upon the Kings Answer.</NOTE> For how is this a mixt <HI>Government,</HI> when Kings do what they please? They <HI>Call</HI> their <HI>People</HI> to a <HI>Parliament,</HI> where the three <HI>Estates</HI> are said to be the mixt <HI>Government,</HI> but what is their great <HI>Errand</HI>? to get <HI>Money.</HI> If they touch upon <HI>mis|carriage in Government,</HI> it disparages him to his people, (for now the inside of his <HI>Copses</HI> are <HI>well grown again.</HI>) If upon <HI>Re|ligion,</HI> he knows well enough how to order that, if the <HI>Treaty</HI> with <HI>Spain</HI> goes on. And for the affairs of <HI>State,</HI> he seems to imply as if there were some hidden and secret <HI>Art</HI> in those <HI>Mysteries of King-craft,</HI> that the <HI>Parliaments</HI> apprehension can|not reach.

And now an <HI>Ambassador</HI> (as one saith) <HI>lyes</HI> abroad, <HI>Reipublicae causa,</HI> for the good of his Countrey, which tends rather to the hurt of it.</P>
<P>But now they find that the King would only make <HI>Mer|chandize</HI> of the <HI>Common-wealth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia|ment the Kings Merchants.</NOTE> yet <HI>Merchants</HI> look for their Money again with advantage, and therefore their <HI>Counsel</HI> in disposing it may be well spared. But the <HI>Parliament</HI> it they raise Money from the <HI>People</HI> (which is never to be repayed) there is good reason they should know not only to what pur|pose it is levied, but how prudently and sitly laid out: other|wise as the <HI>King</HI> tells them in the comparison of the <HI>Robber</HI> (though in relation to his <HI>Prerogative</HI>) if they should be sum|moned to levy Money of the <HI>people</HI> without <HI>consideration</HI> of what it is for, or how it shall be disposed for the good of the <HI>Kingdom,</HI> they may very well say and protest, That they meant not to take it from them so; that is, not to rob them of it. But the <HI>King's necessities</HI> must come under the <HI>Common Emergencies,</HI> which he would not have known; and what will one <HI>Subsidy</HI> without fifteens do? The <HI>Protestants</HI> want in the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> so doth he in <HI>England</HI>: But <HI>he</HI> had lately a great assistance from his <HI>People,</HI> never <HI>King</HI> of <HI>England</HI> found greater love, (as he saith of himself) yet he wants still, and would have supply for it under the <HI>notion</HI> of a War. They must consider what Money is fit, what Foot, what Horse necessary, but they must not know for what. All that they can imagine, is, that the
<PB N="186" REF="170">
<HI>King</HI> wants Money for his <HI>Favourite Buckingham,</HI> and his kin|dred, to furnish them against <HI>Christmas,</HI> for feasting, gaming, and bravery, the three main <HI>pillars</HI> of the <HI>Times</HI> licentious|ness, raised up to a stupendious and excessive height, or to send out his <HI>Ambassadors,</HI> or help his indigent and expensive Courtiers, and then the Wars are ended; for <HI>Want</HI> is a great <HI>War.</HI> But if the good of the Kingdom, the establish|ment of <HI>Religion,</HI> the happiness of the King and his <HI>Posterity</HI> be not fit Themes for them to discourse of, why are they called?</P>
<P>The late <HI>Queen</HI> (whose <HI>memory</HI> will be for ever famous) by the King's own relation liked the <HI>Parliaments Petition</HI> well, when they humbly besought her to marry, because they did not prescribe her <HI>place</HI> and <HI>person,</HI> but left that to her <HI>Election,</HI> if they had done otherwise, <HI>She</HI> would have thought it presump|tion in them. The King thinks it presumption in the <HI>Parlia|ment,</HI> humbly to beseech him (for the good of <HI>Religion</HI>) to per|mit his Son to marry with a <HI>Protestant Princess,</HI> if they had fixt upon <HI>place</HI> or <HI>person,</HI> he would have thought it High Treason. So many degrees high was the King's spirit mounted above a <HI>Woman</HI>'s to humble <HI>Subjects,</HI> and so many degrees lower then <HI>Hers</HI> was his <HI>Spirit</HI> to daring <HI>Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>Some of these things were publickly discoursed of among them in the <HI>House,</HI> and other-some muttered and talkt of in private (<HI>for full breasts will find vent</HI>) but the <HI>main business</HI> that the <HI>Commons</HI> insisted on, was the King's incroachment upon their <HI>Liberties,</HI> debarring them <HI>freedom of speech in Par|liament,</HI> which was a Natural, Reasonable, and uncontroul'd immunity, as long as they kept themselves within the limits of their duty, which the <HI>House</HI> was to be the <HI>sole judge</HI> of. And who can tax any particular <HI>Member</HI> with <HI>miscarriages</HI> that way, that the house hath not Censured hitherto? for now the <HI>heat</HI> is but new broke in among them, and this liberty of speech stuck most with them; for if any man should speak any thing to displease the King (though it tended never so much to the good of the Kingdom) it might be termed insolent behavi|our, and be liable to <HI>punishment</HI> after <HI>Parliament</HI> (if not then) as the King threatens in his Letter; which carried such a Ter|ror and over-awing with it, that they resolved to give over all business, left they should offend. Which the King hearing of, writes again to his <HI>Secretary, Calvert,</HI> and the <HI>Speaker,</HI> to take off the edge of those sharp expressions he used in his Letters, thinking to cool the heat among them.</P>
<P>But before this heat was in the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Commons,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The higher House offend|ed.</NOTE> the Lords began to consider how cheap they were made by the multi|tude of <HI>Irish,</HI> and <HI>Scotch</HI> Earls and Viscounts, the King had ac|cumulated, not the Natives of those <HI>Kingdoms,</HI> but private

<HI>English</HI> Gentlemen, who had procured, and assumed those Ti|tles, to perch above the <HI>English</HI> Baronry, to their great regret and dishonour.

<P>THat whereas your <HI>Majesty</HI> at the importunity of some natural Subjects of this Realm of <HI>England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">They Peti|tion.</NOTE> hath been pleased to confer upon them, <HI>Honours, Titles,</HI> and <HI>Dignities,</HI> peculiar to other your <HI>Majestie</HI>'s <HI>Dominions,</HI> by which all the <HI>Nobility</HI> of this Realm, ei|ther in themselves, their <HI>Children</HI> or both, find they are prejudiced.

<P>Thus we see the <HI>Errors</HI> of <HI>Princes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King angry.</NOTE> are sometimes put into the <HI>Scale,</HI> and they bring with them so much trouble and vexa|tion
<PB N="188" REF="171">
that they often weigh down their <HI>Glory</HI> and <HI>Happiness</HI>; for no man can feel the load and burthen of it, but he that wears a <HI>Crown.</HI> The King was <HI>conscious</HI> to himself that he had done these Noblemen injury, especially the <HI>Barons,</HI> to ad|vance their inferiours above them, for a little profit either to himself or his <HI>Courtiers.</HI> And if he had not heard of this <HI>Pe|tition</HI> before, such a Troop of attendance together might have startled him, but being prepared for it, he mustered up his <HI>Spirits,</HI> thinking it too great an abasement for <HI>Majesty</HI> to stoop at their <HI>Summons,</HI> being so publick an <HI>Action</HI>; or to lesson or recall what he had done. Yet he was troubled, not knowing what <HI>quarrels</HI> the strife for <HI>place</HI> and <HI>precedency</HI> might produce; or what ill blood the discontent of so many of the <HI>No|bility</HI> at one time might ingender: Therefore he sent for them all, or the most eminent and leading men of them, some days after, and expostulated the <HI>business</HI> with them, one by one, in private, knowing he could deal best with them so, beginning with some of them roughly, yet still he closed with them at last, his anger being (as it were) raised to make them humble, and recon|cile themselves to him, that he might the better recon|cile himself to them. And to the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> he vented this Expression, <HI>I fear thee not</HI> Essex, <HI>if thou wert as well beloved as thy father, and hadst forty thousand men at thy heels.</HI> Which words he uttered as if he had chid himself that they made an escape from him. And though this <HI>Petition</HI> did not derogate from the <HI>Dignity</HI> of those <HI>creations</HI> past, yet the King willingly restrained himself for the time to come.</P>
<P>But the <HI>House of Commons</HI> found the <HI>King's Letters</HI> to entangle the way rather than make a free passage to their <HI>Liberties,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Commons discontent.</NOTE> for that which was their birth-right would now come to be deri|ved from his Ancestors. And for all the King's finenesses they thought <HI>Religion</HI> very <HI>un secure</HI>: for as long as the bent of his <HI>Affections</HI> tended to the <HI>Spanish match,</HI> there must needs be a <HI>wide Gap open</HI> as an inlet to <HI>Popery</HI>; and if it may be made <HI>Treason</HI> for his <HI>Parliament</HI> to advise him from it, they saw but a very small door left open to liberty. But whatsoever befell them, they resolved to leave to <HI>posterity</HI> some prints and footsteps of their <HI>Parliamentary Rights</HI> and <HI>Privileges,</HI> left them by their great <HI>Ancestors,</HI> that though they could not preserve them intire, those that succeed them might at least find some <HI>Reliques,</HI> and ruins of what they had; Which made them make this <HI>Protestation</HI> re|corded in their <HI>Iournal Book,</HI> 19.

Privileges, and Iurisdictions of <HI>Parliament,</HI> are the ancient and un|doubted <HI>Birth-right,</HI> and inheritance of the <HI>Subjects</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> And that the arduous and urgent affairs concerning the <HI>King, State,</HI> and defence of the <HI>Realm,</HI> and of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> and the <HI>Maintenance,</HI> and making of <HI>Laws,</HI> and redress of <HI>Mischiefs</HI> and grievances, which daily happen within this <HI>Realm,</HI> are proper <HI>Subjects,</HI> and matter of <HI>Counsel,</HI> and debate in <HI>Parliament.</HI> And that in the handling and proceeding of those businesses, every <HI>Member</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> hath, and of right ought to have <HI>freedom</HI> of <HI>Speech,</HI> to propound, treat, reason, and bring to <HI>Conclusion</HI> the same. And that the <HI>Commons</HI> in <HI>Parliament</HI> have likewise liberty, and free|dom to treat of these <HI>Matters,</HI> in such order as in their judgments shall seem fittest.

<P>And as these <HI>Troubles</HI> bred disturbance at home,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King dishonoured abroad.</NOTE> so they be|got discredit abroad, for now (by this Breach) they under|valued the King's <HI>power</HI> as much as they did before his <HI>Spirit</HI>: yea, even in the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s own <HI>Towns</HI> (whilst this belo|ved Treaty was in heat) they in their <HI>Comedies</HI> presented <HI>Mes|sengers</HI> bringing <HI>News</HI> in haste, That the <HI>Palatinate</HI> was like to have a very <HI>formidable Army</HI> shortly on foot: For the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> would furnish him with a hundred thousand <HI>picked Herrings,</HI> the Hollanders with a hundred thousand Butter|boxes, and <HI>England</HI> with a hundred thousand <HI>Ambassadors.</HI> And they picture the King in one place with a Scabberd without a Sword.

<P>And now the Treaty goes on amain. The Lord <HI>Digby</HI> is sent into <HI>Spain</HI> extraordinary <HI>Ambassador.</HI> To relate the manner of whose entertainment after his arrival there, it may not be impertinent: for by it may be discovered the Course-grain of <HI>Spanish civility,</HI> and how much our <HI>Ambassador</HI> went against the hair then, though happily the way may be smother now.</P>
<P>He landed at St. <HI>Andero</HI> in <HI>Biscay,</HI> a poor <HI>Maritime</HI> Town, where the people for the most part go all barefoot: and there his Lordship had the <HI>patience</HI> to stay a Fortnight expe|cting the Court civilities, which were then upon remove from <HI>Madrid</HI> to <HI>Lerma</HI> (being part of the way to St. <HI>Andero</HI>) with|out any intention to meet his Lordship. When his expecta|tions were tired with attending their <HI>Formalities,</HI> he sent his <HI>Secretary, Simon Digby,</HI> to <HI>Madrid,</HI> to be a Solicitor to the Duke of <HI>Lerma</HI> (who then bore the sway) that he might have his first <HI>Audience</HI> at <HI>Lerma.</HI> And after some waiting time (though he had <HI>Our King's Agent,</HI> Mr. <HI>Cottington,</HI> for his <HI>Assistant</HI>) he was returned with a <HI>Spanish shrug,</HI> That the King would by no means admit of his desire, because he knew the <HI>Ambassador</HI> came about <HI>business,</HI> and he went to <HI>Lerma</HI> only for pleasure.
<PB N="193" REF="174">
This was a <HI>Rub</HI> in his Lordship's way, and being impatient till it were removed, he sent again to <HI>Court</HI> a second <HI>Petition,</HI> which was to be presented with all the power <HI>Cottington</HI> could make, and his importunity got the upper hand of the <HI>Spanish Resolu|tion</HI> (though much against their minds) that he might come to <HI>Lerma</HI>; for which his Lordship was so elevated in his <HI>spirits,</HI> that he pleased himself in an endeavouring way to express, <HI>That the King of</HI> Spain <HI>would not have done this favour to any Am|bassador, but the King of</HI> England's; <HI>nor to any that our King should have sent, but himself.</HI> And it may be partly true, for none (it is hoped) would have begg'd it so shamefully as he did; for there was no business to be expected; that must be turned into feasting and jollity; and if he had not hunted after the <HI>King of</HI> Spain <HI>for the favour,</HI> they would have let <HI>Don Iuvan,</HI> (as they called him) dance attendance at <HI>Madrid</HI> till all their Sports at <HI>Lerma</HI> had been finished. For all his <HI>Train</HI> (many of them <HI>Knights,</HI> and <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> of good <HI>quality</HI>), murmured to see him so sleighted by the <HI>Spaniard</HI>; that being known to be a whole month in the Countrey, he had not the least message or civility from the <HI>Court</HI>; which extraordinary <HI>miscarriage,</HI> would have put any but an <HI>Extraordinary Ambassador</HI> out of countenance. But his Lordship made <HI>Bonne mine,</HI> and pleased himself with the great <HI>favours he should receive at</HI> Lerma, <HI>and</HI> so came forward to <HI>Burgos,</HI> which is within twenty English miles of <HI>Lerma</HI>: And though the Court had been a Fortnight at <HI>Lerma,</HI> yet there was no more news of his <HI>Reception</HI> at <HI>Bur|gos,</HI> than if he had been still at St. <HI>Andero.</HI></P>
<P>And now his Lordship fearing they would wholly neglect him, thought it his best course to send <HI>Cottington</HI> (who met him at <HI>Burgos</HI>) to <HI>Lerma,</HI> to learn what their pleasure was to do with him; who returning brought word, that the next day he should have advice what <HI>Order</HI> would be taken. And accordingly one of the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Lerma</HI>'s Secretaries sent a poor fellow with a Letter, that the next day (being Sunday) there should be two Coaches sent, to bring his Lordship on Tuesday following to <HI>Villa Manza</HI> (a Village a mile short of <HI>Lerma</HI>) where his Lodgings should be ready, and the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Harbingers</HI> attending to prepare all things with <HI>Diligence.</HI> This gave new life to his Lordship's <HI>spirits</HI>; the <HI>Coaches</HI> came according to the time, and to <HI>Villa Manza</HI> they went, every man furnished in his best accoutrements, hoping to see the <HI>Count</HI> that night: But they only found a pitiful, poor, ragged <HI>Village</HI>; where enquiring for the Lord <HI>Ambassador's house,</HI> the honest Country people told them, surely they were mistaken, they knew of no house, nor <HI>Harbinger,</HI> nor what they meant; being as much amazed at the strange <HI>questions</HI> of the English, as they had cause to be at their strange <HI>Entertainment.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="175">The English romed up and down the Town, and could dis|cover no <HI>house</HI> fit for the <HI>Ambassador</HI> to go into, so that he was forced to sit in the <HI>Coach,</HI> and sent <HI>Walsingham Greisley</HI> in all haste to <HI>Lerma,</HI> to know how he should be disposed of: <HI>Greisley</HI> returned, and told the <HI>Ambassador,</HI> They were all so busie in seeing a <HI>Play,</HI> that he could not come to speak with any man that understood any thing relating to his Lordship. Which so distracted him, that he began to doubt whether <HI>Villa Manza</HI> were the place, and it begot a new <HI>Scrutiny,</HI> but the <HI>Scruple</HI> was quickly removed, by finding <HI>Villa Manza</HI> in the Letter, in very legible <HI>characters.</HI> And now he could no lon|ger dissemble like an <HI>Ambassador,</HI> but supplying with impa|tience what he wanted in <HI>Authority,</HI> commanded the Coach|men in a very hasty manner to drive back to <HI>Burgos,</HI> which they very punctually refused; whereupon his Lordship leapt out of the Coach, and in a great <HI>Choller</HI> mounted on Horse|back, crying to his Company, <HI>Away.</HI> The Coachmen seeing him resolute, and fearing to lose their Reward, told his Lordship, They would venture a Chiding to do him service, which dismounted him again, and he entered the <HI>Coach</HI>; but before the wheels turned about, his mind changed, and by some little whispering advice of <HI>Cottington</HI>'s he now deter|mined to tarry there all night: So that after sitting still four hours in a Coach, he made a worse choice, entring into a poor <HI>Cottage,</HI> where bare walls, and want of such sitting fur|niture as helps <HI>Nature</HI>'s weariness, might tell his Lordship that the <HI>Commons</HI> of <HI>England</HI> stand on a better foundation than wooden shoes.

<P>But now news was brought that a Harbinger was come, who said there was a house, and all things provided, so that his Lordship composed his <HI>countenance</HI> as well as he could upon such a sudden warning, and commanded the <HI>Harbinger</HI> to be brought to him; who excusing himself for not com|ing time enough to attend his Lordship, said, He was glad to see his Lordship had lighted upon the right House. My Lord something dashed with the ill accommodation, asked him, How he knew it to be the right house? he answered, That himself and one of his fellows had been there the day before to be speak it. The Master of the House being questioned about it (having formerly denied it) made good his first assertion, denying there was any body at his House: Which put his Lordship into such a fit of <HI>Anger,</HI> that he threatned to throw the <HI>Harbinger</HI> out at the window for lying. The man affrigh|ted,

The <HI>Duke</HI> perhaps glad of the occasion, gave (by way of <HI>Diversion</HI>) good ear to the fellow's words, and putting on the severest Countenance, told <HI>Cottington,</HI> He did not think that so great a <HI>Councellor</HI> as <HI>Don Iuan,</HI> would have so miscarried with <HI>passion,</HI> as to menace, and affront the King's Officer in that manner.

things, which he effected, for the old ruinous <HI>Body of the Abby Church at Westminster</HI> was new clothed by him; The fair and beautiful <HI>Library of</HI> St. <HI>Iohn</HI>'s in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> was a <HI>Pile of his Ere|ction</HI>; and a very compleat <HI>Chappel</HI> built by him at <HI>Lincoln-College</HI> in <HI>Oxford,</HI> meerly for the name of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> having no interest in, nor relation to that <HI>University.</HI> These were <HI>Argu|ments</HI> of a great <HI>Mind,</HI> how far from <HI>Ostentation</HI> in this frail <HI>Body of Flesh,</HI> cannot be determined, because the <HI>Benefit</HI> of pub|lick <HI>Actions,</HI> smooths every stone that makes up the <HI>building.</HI></P>
<P>But that which heightned him most in the <HI>Opinion</HI> of those that knew him best, was his bountiful <HI>Mind</HI> to <HI>Men</HI> in <HI>Want,</HI> being a great <HI>Patron</HI> to support, where there was <HI>Merit</HI> that wanted supply. Among the rest <HI>Monsieur de Molin,</HI> a very famous <HI>Minister</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> (in the persecution there) driven into <HI>England</HI> for <HI>Refuge.</HI> The <HI>Bishop</HI> hearing of him, spoke to Doctor <HI>Hacket</HI> his <HI>Chaplain</HI> to make him a <HI>Visit</HI> from him. And because (saith he) I think the <HI>Man</HI> may be in <HI>Want,</HI> in a <HI>strange Country,</HI> carry him some <HI>Money,</HI> not naming the Sum, because he would sound the depths of his <HI>Chaplain</HI>'s <HI>mind.</HI> Doctor <HI>Hacket</HI> finding the <HI>Bishop</HI> nominate no proportion, told him he could not give him less than twenty pound. <HI>I did demur</HI> upon the <HI>Sum</HI> (said the <HI>Bishop</HI>) to try you. <HI>Is twenty pound a fit gift for me to give a man of his parts and deserts? Take a hundred pounds, and present it from me, and tell him he shall not want, and I will come shortly and visit him my self.</HI> Which he after perfor|med, and made good his <HI>Promise</HI> in supplying him during his abode in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But these great <HI>Actions</HI> were not publickly visible; those were more apparent that were looked on with an <HI>Envious,</HI> ra|ther than an <HI>Emulous Eye.</HI> For the close and intimate <HI>Corre|spondence,</HI> that was betwixt this <HI>Bishop</HI> and the old <HI>Countess,</HI> set many scurrilous tongues, and <HI>Pens</HI> a work, though he was (as I have been assured) <HI>Eunuchus ad Utero,</HI> which shews that nothing can prevent <HI>Malice,</HI> but such an innocence as it can|not lay hold on. <HI>For it hath ever been accounted a crime, not to endeavour to prevent the voice of Calumny.</HI></P>
<P>His <HI>breach</HI> with <HI>Land, Arch-Bishop</HI> of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and the disgraces put upon him by the Court, will not fall in here, nor his closing again, and <HI>Strugling</HI> when he saw the <HI>Axe</HI> laid to the Root of <HI>Episcopacy.</HI> But by this man's <HI>Actions</HI> (as in a <HI>Mirror</HI>) may be seen that a great <HI>Estate,</HI> which (<HI>besides his bounty</HI>) his places procured him, is a liquorish <HI>Temptation,</HI> to make a <HI>man Proteus</HI>-like vary from one shape to another, and to shape no di|rect course, but to go still as the wind blows.</P>
<P>Not long before this, that <HI>Reverend Prelate,</HI> George <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> a man of a holy and unblamable life (med|ling

There were very many willing to have him retire to his rest, that gaped after his <HI>Dig|nity</HI> more than desert, and though Doctor <HI>Laud</HI> was but newly initiated into his <HI>Bishoprick</HI> of St. <HI>David</HI>'s (by other hands, because those of the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> were tinctured with blood, as he saith himself) yet his enmity was not small against him, for being a means to let the King know; he was reputed a <HI>Papist</HI> in <HI>Oxford,</HI> and a dangerous turbulent <HI>Spirit.</HI> But the King granted out a <HI>Commission</HI> to enquire whether casual <HI>Homicide</HI> did make the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> irregular?

<P><PB N="201" REF="181">The <HI>Directions</HI> the <HI>Archbishop</HI> recommended to his several <HI>Diocesans,</HI> that they might be put in execution with <HI>caution.</HI> And then may be observed that the King's affections tended to the <HI>peaceable comportment</HI> of his people, that both <HI>Papist</HI> and <HI>Puritan</HI> might have a quiet <HI>being</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Observations upon the Directions.</NOTE> which preponderation of <HI>His</HI> puts them in <HI>Aequi-librio,</HI> nay, the <HI>Papist</HI> was in the <HI>prime Scale.</HI> But this new thing called a <HI>Lecturer,</HI> he could by no means endure, unless he past through all the <HI>Briers</HI> of his se|veral Courts to the <HI>Broad Seal,</HI> which was a kind of pungent <HI>Ordeal Tryal,</HI> to which he must put his <HI>Teste me ipso,</HI> and then it was <HI>Orthodox</HI>; so that though <HI>Lecturers</HI> were not absolutely forbidden, yet the <HI>charge</HI> and trouble to come to it, made the way inaccessible. <HI>Preachers</HI> by an <HI>Order of Star-chamber</HI> in <HI>Hea|ven</HI> were first <HI>licensed,</HI> with an <HI>Ite, praedicate,</HI> before <HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>Eighth</HI>'s time; and certainly they have a great <HI>Seal</HI> from thence for what they do: Therefore it behoves them to take heed what they say, left that <HI>Spirit</HI> they receive <HI>Directions</HI> from <HI>bind</HI> them not up.</P>
<P>But this <HI>Animosity</HI> of the <HI>King</HI>'s against <HI>Puritans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Papists the fomenters.</NOTE> was thought to be fomented by the <HI>Papists,</HI> whose <HI>Agent</HI> Bishop <HI>Laud</HI> was suspected to be, though in <HI>Religion</HI> he had a <HI>Motley form</HI> by himself, and would never (as a <HI>Priest</HI> told me plainly in <HI>Flan|ders</HI>) bring his neck under the <HI>obedience</HI> of the <HI>Roman Yoak,</HI> though he might stickle for the grandure of the <HI>Clergy.</HI> And now he began to be <HI>Buckingham</HI>'s <HI>Confessor</HI> (as he expresseth in his own <HI>Notes</HI>) and wore the <HI>Court Livery,</HI> though the King had a sufficient <HI>character</HI> of him, and was pleased with <HI>Asseve|ration</HI> to <HI>protest</HI> his incentive <HI>Spirit</HI> should be kept under, that the flame should not break out by any <HI>Preferment</HI> from him. But that was now forgotten, and he crept so into favour, that he was thought to be the <HI>Bellows</HI> that blew these Fires. For the <HI>Papists</HI> used all the <HI>Artifices</HI> they could to make a <HI>breach</HI> between the King and his People, that they might enter at the same for their own Ends: which to accomplish, they slily close with the chief ministers of <HI>State,</HI> to put the King upon all his <HI>Projects</HI> and <HI>Monopolies,</HI> displeasing to the <HI>people,</HI> that they might the more <HI>Alienate</HI> their <HI>Affections</HI> from him: Sow|ing their <HI>seeds</HI> of <HI>Division</HI> also betwixt <HI>Puritan</HI> and <HI>Protestant</HI>; so that (like the second <HI>Commandment</HI>) they quite exclude the <HI>Protestant</HI>; For all those were <HI>Puritans</HI> with this <HI>high-grown-Arminian-popish party,</HI> that held in <HI>judgment the Doctrine of the Reformed Churches,</HI> or in <HI>practice</HI> live according to the <HI>Doctrine</HI> publickly taught in the <HI>Church of England.</HI> And they attribute the <HI>name of Protestant,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. To such <HI>Papists</HI> as either out of <HI>policy,</HI> or by <HI>popish in|dulgence,</HI> hold outward <HI>Communion</HI> with the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Eng|land.</HI></P>

<P>Then they strive to make a <HI>Division</HI> of <HI>Regians</HI> and <HI>Republi|cans</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Regians and Republicans.</NOTE> The <HI>Regians</HI> are the great <HI>Dependents</HI> upon the <HI>Crown,</HI> both in <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>State,</HI> who <HI>swell</HI> up the <HI>Prerogative,</HI> preach|ing and distilling into the King, the <HI>Almightiness</HI> of his <HI>power.</HI> That all that the <HI>People</HI> hath is the <HI>King</HI>'s, and that it is by his <HI>mercy</HI> they have a bare empty <HI>Being.</HI> And this hoisting up of the King they knew would stir up the <HI>Republicans</HI> to oppose him in his <HI>Designs,</HI> by which they pinch (as the King thinks) his <HI>Prerogative</HI>; feeding a strife, betwixt <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Prerogative,</HI> whereby they escape the <HI>Dint</HI> of both, and hope the fire they kindle will break out at <HI>last</HI> to consume their <HI>Adversaries.</HI> That these things were acted and fomented by <HI>Papists,</HI> was very <HI>probable,</HI> for they were great <HI>Sticklers</HI> about the <HI>Court</HI> and <HI>Council-Table.</HI> But it was too apparent that some of the Clergy (to make their way the smoother to their wished end) began so to adore the King, that he could not be named but more reverence was done to it than to the <HI>Name of God</HI>&punc; And the <HI>Iudges</HI> in their <HI>itinerant Circuits</HI> (the more to enslave the people to <HI>Obedience</HI>) being to speak of the King, would give him such <HI>Sacred</HI> and <HI>Oraculous Titles,</HI> as if their advancement to higher places, must necessarily be laid upon the <HI>foundation</HI> of the <HI>peoples</HI> debasement.</P>
<P>On the other side: The well affected to <HI>Religion</HI> (that knew no other inclination than the <HI>Dictates</HI> of their own <HI>Reason,</HI> ex|periences of former times, and the constant <HI>practices</HI> of the <HI>Romanists</HI> for propagating their own designs) did by their writings and discourses, strive to warm the King's cold tem|per, and put fresh <HI>spirits</HI> into his <HI>chilled veins</HI>; shewing the <HI>Tyranny</HI> of the incroaching <HI>Monarchy</HI> of the <HI>House of Austria</HI> (who was <HI>Rome</HI>'s great <HI>Factor</HI>) and how just and secure the op|posing of such a growing <HI>power</HI> will be; That no <HI>Sword</HI> is so <HI>sharp,</HI> nor <HI>Arm's</HI> so strong, as those that are <HI>cemented</HI> with true <HI>Religion.</HI> The security of <HI>Conscience,</HI> grounded upon the <HI>Word of Truth,</HI> being not only a <HI>Bulwark</HI> to defend, but the best <HI>En|gin</HI> to oppose <HI>Idolatry</HI> and <HI>Ambition.</HI> Thus stood the Kingdom divided in it self.</P>
<P>But as the King strove (after this <HI>Rupture</HI> betwixt him and the <HI>Parliament</HI>) to settle things at home,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King active in the Treaty.</NOTE> and keep his <HI>people</HI> in <HI>obedience,</HI> so he was as active abroad to keep up his own <HI>Reputation</HI>: For he made a full account to salve up all these <HI>mis|carriages,</HI>

Which pro|ceeding, though <HI>Our Ambassador</HI> hath expostulated with the <HI>Infan|ta</HI> and the <HI>Commissioners,</HI> as injurious to Us, and ill beseeming their <HI>Professions</HI> hitherto, yet is there not that readiness shewed to give Us such contentment therein as We might justly <HI>expect,</HI> but <HI>Answers</HI> still protracted, and put off, for advantage; whilst <HI>Our Forces</HI> there remain in great <HI>Distress,</HI> and the <HI>Town</HI> and <HI>Castle</HI> of <HI>Heidelburg</HI> likely in a few <HI>Daies</HI> to be lost, for it cannot hold out long, as We are informed.

<P>Hereupon therefore <HI>Our pleasure is,</HI> That you shall immediately and with as much speed as you may, crave <HI>Audience</HI> of that <HI>King,</HI> and represent unto him the <HI>merit</HI> which We may justly challenge unto <HI>Our self,</HI> for <HI>Our sincere proceedings</HI> with the <HI>Emperor,</HI> and <HI>Him,</HI> in all the course of this business, notwithstanding the many invitations and temptations, which We have had, to engage <HI>Our self</HI> on <HI>Our Son-in-law's</HI> part.

<P>This Letter doth not only discover the shuffling,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King abused.</NOTE> and Fox|like contrivances of the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Austria</HI> to <HI>Work,</HI> and <HI>Earth</HI> themselves in the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> but also the <HI>scorns,</HI> and reproa|ches put upon <HI>Our King,</HI> and (if I may so call them) his <HI>Terriers,</HI> who (with little <HI>Bayings</HI> only) let them work, till they had got into their <HI>Fastnesses,</HI> and strong holds, and then they may <HI>Bay</HI> at leisure, and blame their lazy Belief. But notwithstanding <HI>our King</HI> threatens in his Letter, if <HI>Heidelberg</HI> be lost, and the <HI>Cessation</HI> delayed, he will Treat no more, yet the <HI>Desire</HI> of the <HI>Match</HI> was so radicated in his Heart, that neither the loss of

<HI>Heidleberg,</HI> or <HI>Manheim</HI> that succeeded it, nor the blocking up of <HI>Frankendale</HI> (the last strong hold of his Son-in-laws Inheri|tance) could <HI>Mortifie</HI> his <HI>Hopes.</HI> But as the <HI>Emperor</HI> besieged these Towns with his <HI>Armies,</HI> so he beset the King of <HI>Spain</HI> with his Treaties.

<P>The King in the first of these two Letters gives Thirty dayes more to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Our King's pa|tience.</NOTE> to repent of his bad dealing with him, then was given to the great City, and yet he repented not. And this <HI>Positive</HI> Command (limiting but ten daies after <HI>Audience</HI> for a <HI>Resolution</HI> in these <HI>Points,</HI>) one would have thought should have produced an absolute <HI>Breach,</HI> or a perfect <HI>Conclusion.</HI> But the <HI>Spaniard</HI> continues in his old pace still, and would not be spurr'd up, and <HI>Digby</HI> (now made Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI> for his good Service) whistles after him his <HI>Old Note</HI> still, assu|ring <HI>Our King,</HI> That the King of <HI>Spain</HI> (though slow) was real in his Intentions. And if <HI>Our King</HI> had not had a great good stomach to the Match, he would never have digested this dealing from a <HI>Brother</HI> and a <HI>Servant,</HI> the <HI>Pope</HI> also at the same time giving him a Bit to chew on, interpreting the <HI>Articles</HI> where the <HI>Children of Marriage</HI> were to be brought <HI>up, usque ad annos nubiles,</HI> to be fourteen years old, which <HI>Our King</HI> would not consent to, in respect of the <HI>Scandal</HI> it might produce. For he knew impressions in Youth setled by <HI>Custome,</HI> are not easie to remove, especially where they make <HI>Dints</HI> upon the <HI>Con|science</HI>; therefore he pressed the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> that the <HI>chil|dren</HI>

might not suck in their <HI>Mothers</HI> instructions so long time, being less for his <HI>Honour:</HI> and they with much importunity, brought it down from fourteen to ten, and there they <HI>stuck. Our King</HI> expressed himself willing to have them brought up <HI>sub re|gimine matris,</HI> for seven years, and that time should be limited in the <HI>publique Capitulations,</HI> but if more time were insisted on by the <HI>Pope, He would oblige himself privately by a Letter to the King of</HI> Spain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dated <HI>New-Market</HI> 24.

<P>While they were thus Wire-drawing, time spun out,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Palat.</HI> lost.</NOTE> <HI>Man|heim</HI> the chief Strength and Fortress in the <HI>Palatinate</HI> was taken by <HI>Tilly</HI> the <HI>Emperour's General,</HI> whereof Sir <HI>Horatio Vere</HI> was Commander, surrendred upon honourable <HI>Conditions,</HI> having neither strength of <HI>Men,</HI> or means to resist an Enemy. <HI>Heidel|berg</HI> before it (as the King expressed) was taken by Assault, Sir <HI>Gerard Herbert</HI> the Commander of the Castle slain, after he had repulsed the Enemy from the Assault, breaking six <HI>Pikes</HI> upon them with his own hand. And now <HI>Tilly</HI> (Winter come|ing on) greedy to finish his work, sits down before <HI>Frankendale,</HI> whereof Major <HI>Barrowes</HI> had the <HI>Command,</HI> a man of as much valour and experience, as <HI>Time</HI> the <HI>Director,</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> the <HI>Actor</HI> could make a man capable of. But all this, and the Strength of the Town to boot could not have protected them, (their Wants being stronger than their Enemy) if <HI>Tilly</HI> had not been drowned up in his Trenches, which forced his remove.</P>
<P>And though <HI>Our King</HI> said in his last Answer to the <HI>Parliament's Petition,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Palatinate</HI> a strong Coun|trey.</NOTE> That the <HI>Enemy</HI> would have swallowed up his Forces in the <HI>Palatinate</HI> in eight daies, if my Lord <HI>Digby</HI> had not suc|coured it; yet the weakest of the three Places, which is <HI>Heidel|berg,</HI> was not taken in a moment; for <HI>Tilly</HI> in <HI>Iune</HI> last set down before it, and was constrained to raise his Siege, being not strong enough; and coming again with a greater <HI>Power</HI> in the end of <HI>Iuly</HI> following, he was there above two moneths before he took so much as any of their Out-Works. And <HI>Manheim,</HI> and <HI>Fran|kendale</HI> are two such strong Holds, that if they had been well furnished with Men and Provisions, they might have stood out against <HI>Tilly</HI>; nay the great <HI>Turk,</HI> as well, if not better than <HI>Vienna</HI> the <HI>Imperial City.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="215" REF="190">But though <HI>our King,</HI> and <HI>Prince,</HI> subscribed these <HI>Articles</HI> (as they were sent to them by the Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI>) in this manner; <HI>Hos supra memoratos Articulos omnes ac singulos approbamus, et quic|quid in iis ex nostra parte, seu nostro nomine conventum est, ratum at|que gratum habemus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Spanish delusi|on.</NOTE> approving and expressing them to be very acceptable unto them.

<P>Thus was <HI>our</HI> King's plain heartedness deluded, his <HI>Honour</HI> blemished, his <HI>Love</HI> among his <HI>Subjects</HI> diminished, the time for a positive answer for the <HI>Dispensation</HI> from <HI>Rome</HI> long expired, and prolonged; his <HI>Childrens Patrimony</HI> destroyed, and he left so unsatisfied, that the <HI>Prince</HI> himself, and the <HI>Marquess</HI> of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> must go into <HI>Spain</HI> to unfold this <HI>Riddle,</HI> where they found it as full of <HI>Aenigma's</HI> as at first. He that went to tye a knot there, found it so intangled, that he took some time there to clear it; and when it was clear, he thought it best, <HI>Scindere nodum,</HI> to cut that at last, which he could not unloose at first.</P>

And though he were well intrench|ed for his own <HI>Security,</HI> yet the <HI>Works</HI> of the <HI>Town</HI> were so im|pregnable, that he could find no way to gain it, but by starving them, and that could not be done but by commanding the <HI>River</HI>; and those Batteries that he planted to hinder the access of <HI>Shipping</HI> with Relief into the <HI>Town,</HI> were within reach of their <HI>Cannon,</HI> so that he found there was little good to be done, tending to the reducing of it. This struck the <HI>Marquess</HI> to the <HI>Heart,</HI> that he should bury his <HI>Honour,</HI> as he had done a great part of his <HI>Army,</HI> in those bloody Trenches, and therefore he gave scope to his <HI>Resolution,</HI> to make use of his time, for he con|verted his intentions of <HI>Starving,</HI> to Assaulting, and his assaults were the more <HI>furious,</HI> because he found they would not last long; and <HI>Old Morgan,</HI> that gallant <HI>Colonel,</HI> with his English <HI>Brigade,</HI> gave them their hands full; the <HI>Scots</HI> did Gallant Ser|vice in the Town, and their Colonel <HI>Hinderson</HI> was slain; but many of the <HI>Enemy</HI> fell on every side; for it is a great disadvan|tage for living Bodies to fight against dead Walls, being so high, and unassaultable. <HI>A General</HI> that goes to besiege a <HI>City,</HI> should have his access to it (in his apprehension) as plain as a <HI>Mathe|matician</HI> hath a <HI>Demonstration</HI> (except it be upon some emergent cause) otherwise there is an <HI>Error</HI> in his account, and there cannot be two, for the <HI>Honour</HI> dyes in the first, which touched the <HI>Marquess</HI> near, being his great trouble, and made him, and his enterprise both droop.</P>

<PB N="221" REF="194">
in it, We cannot but admonish your Majesty of the <HI>dan|ger</HI> of it. This being the <HI>Opinion</HI> of <HI>Our Electors,</HI> that seeing your <HI>Majesty</HI> hath graciously called the <HI>Diet</HI> for restoring <HI>Peace</HI> in the <HI>Empire,</HI> that it were altogether necessary first to remove the <HI>Obstacles of Peace.</HI> And seeing that all the stirs began in <HI>Bohemia, Caesar</HI> should do well to labour first for the quieting of that Kingdom, and command a stay to be made of the severe <HI>Reformation,</HI> and frequent <HI>Executions</HI> there; That so the <HI>Hearts</HI> of your <HI>Subjects</HI> being overcome with <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Mercy,</HI> might be sweetly joyned to you, and all fear, and distrust, utterly taken away; without which, we see no hope, either how your <HI>Majesty</HI> can sit sure upon your <HI>Im|perial Throne,</HI> or how the <HI>Electors</HI> and <HI>Princes</HI> can be freed of their fears; being evident, that the <HI>Bohemians,</HI> and others, made desperate by the <HI>Extremity</HI> of their <HI>sufferings,</HI> will take any occasion to begin new troubles, and to involve the <HI>Empire</HI> with new <HI>Dangers.</HI> All the <HI>Lutheran States</HI> of the <HI>Empire,</HI> likewise, which follow the <HI>Augustan Confession,</HI> have their <HI>Eyes</HI> upon this <HI>Bohemian Reformation,</HI> which though it were given out to be for private <HI>Iustice,</HI> yet it is so linkt with the <HI>publick cause,</HI> that unless it be speedily ended, and the two <HI>Churches</HI> at <HI>Prague</HI> (granted by <HI>Rodolphus</HI> the <HI>second</HI>) not in favour of some private men alone, but of <HI>Christian</HI> Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> and which had continued free until of late) were a|gain opened, and the free exercise of <HI>Religion</HI> generally per|mitted, We see no sure <HI>Peace</HI> likely to be in the <HI>Empire,</HI> but ut|ter ruine rather, and final desolation, may every day be feared. Seeing it was apparently known, that it was not those that pro|fessed the <HI>Reformed</HI> Religion, who begun these troubles; but the <HI>Noblemen</HI> and great <HI>Officers,</HI> whose designs the other were compelled to obey.</P>
<P>And for the <HI>Prince Palatine,</HI> seeing he is already suffi|ciently punished, it were far more commendable in your Majesty, that now at last upon his submission, you would be pleased to restore him to his <HI>Lands</HI> and <HI>Dignities,</HI> o|therwise there is no likelihood of Restoring Peace to the <HI>Empire.</HI> And in the transferring of the <HI>Electorate,</HI> this main thing were fit to be considered; Whether the <HI>Prince Pala|tine,</HI> excluded in his own <HI>person,</HI> doth debar his <HI>Children,</HI> who (by the <HI>providence</HI> of their <HI>Ancestors</HI>) had before this Act of their Father, <HI>jus adquisitum,</HI> an Hereditary Right unto the <HI>Electorate</HI>; or the <HI>brother</HI> of the <HI>Prince Palatine,</HI> who hath no way offended your <HI>Majesty</HI>; nor, by reason of his <HI>Minority,</HI> could not; Or others of the Kindred of the <HI>Prince Palatine,</HI> should be, or ought to be in this Case neglected?

And if <HI>Caesar</HI> should die, this <HI>controversie</HI> being not compounded, it may well be feared, many inconveniences will fall out, contrary to <HI>Caesar</HI>'s desire. For though upon the advantage of his <HI>Victories,</HI> he hath had the Law in his own hand, if the Wheel should turn, that side which is lowest will get up again.</P><P>Therefore We hold it more <HI>Wisdom</HI> to advise <HI>Caesar,</HI> not to proceed too suddenly, but rather to accept the intercession of other <HI>Electors</HI> and <HI>Princes,</HI> as in such Cases hath hitherto been done. Considering the <HI>Prince Palatine</HI> was then but young, a|bused by ill <HI>Councel,</HI> and no ways the <HI>Author</HI> of those <HI>stirs</HI> in <HI>Bohemia,</HI> they being in an uproar before his coming among them.

Whereas if he saw the door of <HI>Mercy</HI> quite shut, and nothing left him but his life, it would make both him, and his, desperate to attempt, so as there would be no end of the Troubles in the <HI>Roman Empire. Caesar</HI> therefore should do far righter, if for his own <HI>Honour,</HI> and the <HI>publick</HI> good, he would prefer mercy before <HI>severity,</HI> and not pursue these <HI>Extremities.</HI></P></Q>
<P><HI>To these things the</HI> Catholick Princes <HI>said,</HI> That <HI>Caesar</HI> had shown <HI>Causes</HI> enough which he had to deprive the <HI>Palatine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The opinion of the Popish Princes.</HI></NOTE> and the <HI>Palatinate</HI> being devolved to him, he might dispose of it, without having regard to the <HI>Palatine line,</HI> according to his own pleasure. That his <HI>Majesty</HI> could not well hold any terms of <HI>Amity</HI> with him, though he were restored; and this <HI>impunity</HI> would give occasion unto others to offend. As for the matter of <HI>Punishment,</HI> there would be little difference between the <HI>Emperor,</HI> and the <HI>Palatine,</HI> seeing that his <HI>Majestie's Lands</HI> and <HI>Dominions,</HI> are no less wasted than the o|thers, and yet there is great difference in the cause; for this fell out to <HI>Caesar</HI> without his Demerit, and the <HI>Palatine</HI> did the other, having no necessity to it. That he had refused <HI>mercy,</HI> in not acknowledging his fault, nor seeking for <HI>favour.</HI> And it is an unequal Request for <HI>Caesar</HI> to accept of any <HI>Reconciliation,</HI> whilst his General <HI>Mansfield</HI> is yet in the field, and <HI>prosecutes</HI> his cause by force of <HI>Arms.</HI> The safety of the Empire consisting in the filling up of the <HI>Electoral College</HI> Caesar hath done very well in a speedy resolving on it, and other <HI>Emperors</HI> in the like causes have done the same before.</P>

For if the Prince intended <HI>Really</HI> (when he had <HI>power</HI>) to introduce <HI>Popery</HI> into <HI>England</HI>; this Letter in a bloody colour too apparently would have been discove|red; and if his intentions were formal, and only to close with the <HI>Pope</HI> for his present accommodation, how black would every <HI>Character</HI> of this letter look to the <HI>Roman Ru|brick,</HI> and what a Tincture of <HI>Scandal</HI> would it leave upon the true <HI>Religion?</HI> for <HI>Fallere fallentem,</HI> may be a fit <HI>Motto</HI> for a bad man, not a good <HI>Christian</HI>; so that whatsoever his <HI>Intentions</HI> were, the <HI>Act</HI> was evill: And I could suspect
<PB N="135" REF="206">
it is a forged Letter, but that it hath been asserted by so many <HI>Authors</HI> both at home and abroad.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pope</HI> finding by this letter, and some other private inti|mations, the <HI>Princes</HI> good affections to the <HI>Roman See,</HI> thought it high time to dally no longer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Dispensa|tion comes to <HI>Madrid.</HI></NOTE> but to draw him altogether with the <HI>Cords</HI> of <HI>Love</HI>; therefore he dispatches the <HI>Dispensati|on</HI> to his <HI>Nuntio</HI> at <HI>Madrid,</HI> six months after the Prince's arri|val there, with a little <HI>Bob</HI> at the <HI>Tail</HI> of it, yet to amuse them: Which was, That the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and the <HI>Prince,</HI> should give <HI>Caution</HI> to perform what was <HI>stipulated</HI> between them and the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> especially in those <HI>Articles</HI> which were in favour of the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and other his <HI>Ma|jestie</HI>'s <HI>Dominions</HI>; Requiring at least, some <HI>Soveraign Catholick</HI> Prince should engage for them by oath. This made some little demur; for being sent into <HI>England,</HI> the <HI>King</HI> answered, That he could give no other <HI>Caution</HI> but his own, and the Princes <HI>Royal Words</HI> and <HI>Oaths,</HI> Confirmed by his <HI>Council of State,</HI> and Exemplified under the great <HI>Seal of England.</HI> But this would not satisfie. Therefore the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> undertook it, and it was thought a <HI>Spanish Device,</HI> That by undertaking such an en|gagement, he might not only the more endear himself to the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and to the Prince his <HI>Brother,</HI> but have a more colourable <HI>pretext</HI> to make War against <HI>England,</HI> if the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> there had not <HI>full satisfaction</HI> and freedom ac|cording to the <HI>Articles</HI>; and the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> knowing or assure|ing himself that no Catholick Prince would take such an Oath, offered himself to <HI>satisfie</HI> the Pope. And a Committee of <HI>Eccle|siasticks</HI> in <HI>Spain</HI> were appointed to debate the <HI>Case</HI> in Relation to the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>conscience,</HI> whether he might take such an Oath for them? and they (being doubtless resolved on it before) conclu|ded <HI>Affirmatively.</HI> And that if the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and <HI>Prince</HI> should fail in the performance of these <HI>Capitulations,</HI> the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> might save his Oath, by vindicating the <HI>Breach</HI> thereof upon them with his <HI>Sword.</HI> And now this <HI>Monster</HI>-dif|ficulty being overcome by the <HI>Spanish Bravery,</HI> the very same time <HI>Articles</HI> that our King and Prince had signed (as are before related) were sent into <HI>England</HI> for our King and his privy <HI>Coun|cil</HI> to swear to, and there was not a Rub left for either <HI>party</HI> to stumble at.</P>
<P>But whilst these things were in <HI>motion</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> they were much regretted, and badly resented in <HI>England.</HI> The Spirit al|most of the whole Nation being averse to this Union; which made many vent their <HI>Passion</HI> by their <HI>Pens,</HI> as well as their tongues. Amongst the rest the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> know|ing that a <HI>Toleration</HI> was to be admitted (though he stood tot|tering in the <HI>King</HI>'s Favour, and had the Badg of a <HI>Puritan</HI>
<PB N="236" REF="207">
clapt upon him) thought it better to discharge his Conscience, though he hazarded all, rather than be silent in such a Cause, where the Glory of God, and the Good of the <HI>Kingdom</HI> were so higly concerned. Therefore he writes this letter to the <HI>King</HI>:</P>

And so tenderly is his going apprehended, as believe it, Sir, however his return may be safe, yet the drawers of him to that <HI>Action</HI> so dangerous to himself, to desperate to the Kingdom, will not pass away unquestioned, and unpunished. Besides this <HI>Toleration</HI> which you endeavour to set up by <HI>Proclamation,</HI> cannot be done without a <HI>Parliament,</HI> unless your <HI>Majesty</HI> would let your <HI>Subjects</HI> see, That you will take unto your self a liberty to throw down the <HI>Laws</HI> of the Land at your <HI>Pleasure.</HI> What dreadful <HI>Consequence</HI> these things may draw after them, I beseech your <HI>Majesty</HI> to consider. And above all, lest by this <HI>Toleration,</HI> and discontinuance of the true profession of the Gospel, whereby God hath blessed us, and under which this Kingdom hath for many years flourished, your Majesty do not draw upon the Kingdom in general, and your Self in particular, <HI>God</HI>'s heavy Wrath and Indignation. Thus in discharge of my <HI>Duty</HI> towards God, to your <HI>Majesty,</HI> and the place of my <HI>Calling,</HI> I have taken humble Boldness to deliver my <HI>Conscience.</HI> And now, Sir, do with me what you please.</P>

<P>This forwardness of the Union with <HI>Spain,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jesuits swarm.</NOTE> and indulgence to <HI>Papists,</HI> made <HI>Iesuits</HI> and <HI>Priests</HI> swarm in every corner, set|ting up their subtile <HI>Traps</HI> to catch wavering <HI>Spirits.</HI> And they could not hear of a man of estate that was sick (for persons of <HI>Quality</HI> were only aimed at) but they would tamper with his weak <HI>conscience,</HI> and persuade him to the <HI>Charity</HI> of their <HI>Religi|on,</HI> whereby his <HI>Soul</HI> (that was tainted with earthly <HI>corruptions,</HI> and must needs be purged by <HI>Fire,</HI> before it can come to God) should escape the pains of <HI>Purgatory</HI>; or if it went thither, their Prayers could redeem them thence; with such stuff as this de|ceiving many poor <HI>Soules.</HI> But their most specious jugling <HI>Ar|gument</HI> (which did catch many ignorant persons) was the <HI>Visibi|lity</HI> of their Church in all <HI>Ages</HI> (as they pretended) and their great <HI>Question,</HI> Where the <HI>Protestant</HI> Church was before <HI>Luther</HI>?

<P>Here Mr. <HI>Sweet</HI> interrupted him, saying, These were <HI>Scholasti|cal Points,</HI> not Fundamental.</P>
<P>To which Doctor <HI>White</HI> replied, Those things which are defi|ned in your Council of <HI>Trent,</HI> are to you matters Fundamental. And whatsoever <HI>Article</HI> denied, makes a <HI>Man</HI> an <HI>Heretick,</HI> is <HI>Fundamental.</HI></P>

<P>But the <HI>Iesuits</HI> not being able to prove that any of these things were in practice in the <HI>Primitive Times of Christianity</HI> (but that they wene fobb'd in by several <HI>Popes</HI> and Councils, in latter times, to serve their own turns) waved the <HI>Argument,</HI> and in|sisted upon other <HI>particulars,</HI> not material to the <HI>Point</HI>; striving to confound one thing with another (as their manner is) that they might <HI>complicate,</HI> and wrap up in <HI>obscurity,</HI> all that was spo|ken: Which Mr. <HI>Buggs</HI> perceiving, rested fully satisfied and confirmed in the <HI>Truth.</HI></P>
<P>But thus the <HI>Iesuits</HI> ranged up and down seeking whom they might devour;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A great judg|ment, or an unfortunate mishap.</NOTE> and their Insolency being greater, and more no|torious at this time, than at others, the mischief that fell to them in this Height of their <HI>pride</HI> and <HI>greatness,</HI> is very remarkable: For at at a <HI>Sermon</HI> in <HI>Black-Friers,</HI> where Father <HI>Drurie,</HI> a <HI>Iesuit,</HI> vented his pestilent <HI>Doctrine</HI> to an <HI>Auditory</HI> of near three Hundred people, the Floor of the <HI>Chamber</HI> (being an upper room) fell down, and killed the <HI>Preacher,</HI> and almost (if not) a full Hundred of his <HI>Auditory</HI> outright, maiming and bruising

most of the rest, many of them lying a long time under the <HI>Rub|bish,</HI> crying for Help, and with much difficulty recovered their broken Limbs.

<P>The Commanders in chief of this Army under the Duke of <HI>Brunswick,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Cheif Of|ficers.</NOTE> were <HI>Duke William</HI> of <HI>Wimar,</HI> Marshall General of the Field; <HI>Count Stirum,</HI> General of the Horse; <HI>Count Isenburg,</HI> Ge|neral of the Ordnance; and <HI>Kniphuisen,</HI> Sergeant Major Ge|neral; men acquainted with War, and Danger.

Who answered, Nothing, all is well. But <HI>Brunswick</HI> going forward, found the contrary, for the <HI>Enemy</HI> had made a great slaughter, laying almost a thousand <HI>Horse</HI> upon the Ground.</P>
<P>This perplexed <HI>Brunswick</HI> exceedingly, so that with some <HI>Pas|sion,</HI> he sent a Command to <HI>Stirum</HI> to advance his <HI>Horse</HI> towards the Body of the <HI>Army,</HI> who had stayed three hours for them at the fourth <HI>Passage,</HI> whither the <HI>Duke</HI> returned to secure the same, planting two Peeces of Demi-cannon at the <HI>Mouth</HI> of the <HI>Passage,</HI> and leaving two thousand <HI>Musqueteers</HI> to guard it, for the assistance of the <HI>Horse,</HI> if the Enemy should come to charge them at the Entrance; and so he marched forward with the rest of the <HI>Army.</HI> But <HI>Stirum</HI> drew the Horse into a Body under the side of a Wood, which was in the middle of a spacious plain, betwixt the two <HI>Passages,</HI> and that brought the <HI>Enemy</HI> to a stand: for they suspected the whole <HI>Army</HI> stood in <HI>Battalia</HI> behind that Wood, and therefore did not advance, which shewed, they watched only for advantages. And <HI>Stirum</HI> seeing the Enemie at a stand, drew his Horse towards the fourth <HI>Passage,</HI> which the Enemy observing made all the haste after that could be, to pelt them in the <HI>Rere,</HI> but the Horse passed the fourth <HI>Passage</HI> before the Enemy came up.</P>

Who answered, <HI>Take you no care, trust me.</HI> But presently discovering some of the <HI>Officers</HI> that had command of the <HI>Musqueteers</HI> running towards the <HI>Army,</HI> he took a more lively apprehension that the <HI>Passage</HI> was lost, and meeting <HI>Kni|phuisen,</HI> with some heat, told him he had betrayed him; But <HI>Kniphuisen</HI> excused himself that he could not keep it against an <HI>Army,</HI> and complained that the Horse had abandoned him. But said he, the next <HI>Passage</HI> is of as great importance as the last, and I will undertake to keep that upon forfeiture of my Head, to re|deem my <HI>Credit</HI> again, and to that end he desired an entire <HI>Re|giment</HI> of <HI>Foot,</HI> which the <HI>Duke</HI> granted him, but assured him he should answer it if any ill succeeded by his default.</P>

<P>The <HI>Grandees</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> having notice thereof,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Duke</HI> and <HI>Olivares</HI> quar|tel.</NOTE> were much troubled, for their <HI>Design</HI> was to detain the Prince there all Winter, not only hoping thereby to turn him to their <HI>Religion,</HI> but to marry him to the <HI>Infanta,</HI> that there might have been a <HI>Co-union</HI> between them, that she being with <HI>Child</HI> before the <HI>Spring,</HI> they might keep her there till she were delivered, that so, the Child might be bred up and <HI>naturalized</HI> a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> both in affection and <HI>Religion,</HI> which this suddain <HI>Resolution</HI> hindring, it somewhat startled them. <HI>Olivares</HI> told <HI>Buckingham,</HI> that he had promised the Prince should admit of <HI>Communion</HI> with some <HI>Iesuits</HI> of theirs in Matters of <HI>Religion.</HI></P>

The <HI>Duke</HI> sent the <HI>Conde</HI> word again by the said Lord, That he laid a thing to his charge that would not admit of a less sharp answer; for when his Honour comes in com|petition with the <HI>Conde's</HI> he had rather that should suffer than his own.

Her <HI>Extraction</HI> was high, fit for her great Mind, yet (<HI>he</HI> descended so low as to marry one <HI>Prannel</HI> a Vintner's Son in <HI>London,</HI> having a good estate, who dying, lest her <HI>Childless,</HI> a young and beautiful Widow; up|on whom Sir <HI>George Rodney</HI> a Gentleman in the <HI>West</HI> (suitable to her for person and fortune) fixing his love, had good hopes from her to reap the fruits of it; But <HI>Edward Earl</HI> of <HI>Hertford</HI> being intangled with her fair <HI>Eyes,</HI> and she having a tang of her <HI>Grand-Fathers Ambition,</HI> left <HI>Rodney,</HI> and married the <HI>Earl; Rodney</HI> having drunk in too much affection, and not being able with his <HI>Reason</HI> to digest it, summoned up his scattered <HI>Spirits</HI> to a most desperate attempt; and coming to <HI>Amesbury</HI> in <HI>Wiltshire</HI> (where the <HI>Earl</HI> and his Lady were then <HI>Resident</HI>) to act it, he retired to an Inn in the Town, shut him|self up in a Chamber, and wrote a large paper of well-compo|sed <HI>Verses,</HI> to the <HI>Countess</HI> in his own blood (strange kind of <HI>Composedness</HI>) wherein he bewailes and laments his own un|happiness; and when he had sent them to her, as a sad <HI>Cata|strophe</HI> to all his <HI>Miseries,</HI> he ran himself upon his <HI>Sword,</HI> and so ended that life which he thought death to injoy; leaving the <HI>Countess</HI> to a strict remembrance of her inconstancy, and himself a desperate and sad Spectacle of <HI>Frailty.</HI> But she easily past this over, and so wrought upon the good <HI>Nature</HI> of the <HI>Earl</HI> her Husband, that he settled above five thousand pounds a year jointure upon her for life. In his time She was often courted by the Duke of <HI>Lenox,</HI> who presented many a fair of|fring to her, as an humble <HI>Suppliant</HI>; sometimes in a blew Coat with a Basket-hilt sword, making his addresses in such odd disguises; yet she carried a fair fame during the <HI>Earl's</HI> time.

<P>When She was Countess of <HI>Hertford,</HI> and found admirers a|bout her, She would often discourse of her two Grand-Fathers, the <HI>Dukes</HI> of <HI>Norfolk</HI> and <HI>Buckingham</HI>; recounting the time since one of her <HI>Grand-Fathers</HI> did this, the other did that: But if the Earl her Husband came in presence, she would quickly de|sist; for when he found her in those <HI>Exaltations,</HI> to take her down, he would say, Frank, Frank, <HI>How long is it since thou wert Married to</HI> Prannel? which would damp the Wings of her <HI>Spirit,</HI> and make her look after her <HI>feet,</HI> as well as gawdy <HI>Plumes.</HI></P>
<P>One Little Vanity of this great <HI>Dutchess</HI> (with your <HI>Patience</HI>) may yet croud in this <HI>Story</HI>; She was a <HI>Woman</HI> greedy of <HI>Fame,</HI> and loved to keep great <HI>State</HI> with little Cost: For being much <HI>visited</HI> by all the <HI>Great ones,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of her Visi|tants.</NOTE> she had her formality of <HI>Officers,</HI> and <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> that gave attendance, and this advantage that none ever eat with her; Yet all the Tables in the Hall were spread, as if there had been Meat, and men to furnish them; but before eating time (the house being voided) the Linnen returned into their folds again, and all her people grased on some few dishes. Yet whether her <HI>Actions</HI> came into <HI>Fames</HI> fingring, her Gifts were suitable to the greatness of her Mind. For the <HI>Queen</HI> of <HI>Bo|hemia</HI> (to the Christning of whose <HI>Child</HI> she was a Witness) had some taste of them. And being blowing up by Admiration for this <HI>Bounty,</HI> either by her own design to magnifie her <HI>Merit,</HI> or by others in Mockery to magnifie her <HI>Vanity,</HI> huge Inventories of <HI>Massie Plate</HI> went up and down, from hand to hand, that she had given that <HI>Queen,</HI> and most believed it; yet they were but Paper presents, those Inventories had an <HI>non est inventus</HI> at the <HI>Hague,</HI> they saw the <HI>Shell,</HI> the Inventory, but never found the <HI>Kernel,</HI> the <HI>Plate.</HI> Such difference there is betwixt solid worth, and <HI>Airy-pa|per-Greatness.</HI> And it is hoped these sleight intermixtures, will be no great transgression, because long serious things do dull the <HI>Fancy.</HI></P>
<P>The King having digested his sudain loss of the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Rich|mond,</HI> and fitted himself to make his mind known to his people, in <HI>Parliament</HI>; he went to the <HI>House</HI> the nineteenth, as is said, and opened himself to them to this effect.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King's Speech to the Parliament.</HI></NOTE>To testifie to the <HI>World</HI> how far my mind hath been from esohew|ing to assemble a <HI>Parliament,</HI> and how willing I have been upon all

<HI>Occasions</HI> to have the advice of my people. I have at this present cal|led you, to approve unto you the earnest desire I have ever had, and still have, to deserve the love of my people, by improving your trust, and communicating unto you a Matter of as great <HI>Consequence</HI> as ever King imparted to his people, to have their advice and Counsel in.</P>
<P>I shall say unto you as <HI>Christ</HI> said to the <HI>Church,</HI> I am your <HI>Hus|band,</HI> and you are my <HI>Spouse.</HI> And as it is the <HI>Part</HI> of a good <HI>Husband</HI> to procure, and maintain the love of his <HI>wife</HI>; which he usually doth by often visiting her, and upon extraordinary <HI>Occasions</HI> communica|ting the secrets of his affairs unto her, and by all gentle and affable wayes to gain her <HI>Love</HI>: So in the administration of <HI>Government,</HI> I desire to carry my self towards my <HI>People.</HI> There are two wayes by which a King may shew his love to his People. One is, by a constant ad|ministration of Iustice, according to the <HI>Laws</HI> established; the other is, by communicating himself to his <HI>People,</HI> in their <HI>Representative,</HI> the <HI>Parliament.</HI> For the first, I know there's no particular Man of you that hath not injoyed the <HI>Blessing</HI> and <HI>Benefit</HI> of it; which I will say nothing of, because you have been all Witness of it; for who hath not found the fruits of it? If he considers the <HI>Peace</HI> which my <HI>King|domes</HI> injoy, in the midst of the <HI>Miseries</HI> our Neighbours are afflicted with. And though I cannot say my <HI>Government</HI> hath been without <HI>Error,</HI> yet this I can truly say, and will avouch it before <HI>God,</HI> and his <HI>Angels,</HI> That never King governed with a more pure sincerity, and uncorrupt <HI>Heart,</HI> than I have done, far from all intention, and mean|ing of the least <HI>Error,</HI> or imperfection in my <HI>Reign.</HI></P>
<P>I have assembled you at this time to perform the other part, which is duely to impart unto you, a <HI>Secret,</HI> and a Matter of as great im|portance as can to be to my <HI>Estate,</HI> and the <HI>Estate,</HI> of my <HI>Children</HI>; I crave your best, and safest advice, and Counsel, as the <HI>Writ</HI> where|by you are assembled imports, <HI>That the King would advise with you in matters concerning his</HI> Estate <HI>and</HI> Dignity; And as I have ever indeavoured by this, and the like waies, to procure, and cherish the love of my <HI>People</HI> towards me, So do I hope, and fully believe, that ne|ver any <HI>King</HI> was more beloved of his <HI>People</HI> (whom you my Lords and Gentlemen do here represent) so I would have you truly repre|sent their <HI>loves</HI> also to me, that in you as in a true glass I may perfect|ly behold it, and not as a false glass presents it, not at all, or otherwise than it is indeed. Give me your free and faithful <HI>Counsel</HI> in this Matter, which is that of which you have often heard, the Match of my Son. Wherein as you may know I have spent much time, with great Cost, in long Treaty, desiring alwaies therein (and not without <HI>reason,</HI> hoping to have effected my desires) the advancement of my <HI>Estate,</HI> and <HI>Children,</HI> and the general <HI>Peace</HI> of all <HI>Christendom.</HI> Wherein I have alwaies constantly <HI>laboured,</HI> depending too much upon fair <HI>Hopes</HI> and <HI>Promises.</HI> But at the earnest instance of my Son, I was conten|ted
<PB N="261" REF="226">
(although it was of an extraordinary <HI>Nature</HI>) to send him to pro|secute his <HI>Desires</HI> in <HI>Spain</HI>; and for his more safety I sent <HI>Bucking|ham</HI> (in whom I ever reposed the most trust of my <HI>Person</HI>) with him with this command, to be continually present with him, and never leave him, till he returned safe again unto me; which he performed, though not with such effect as I expected, yet not altogether without <HI>Profit</HI>; for it taught me this <HI>Point</HI> of Wisdom, that, <HI>Qui versatur in Universa|libus,</HI> &amp;c. is easily deceived, and it generally brings nothing to good issue; for before any <HI>Matter</HI> can be fully finished, it must be brought to <HI>particulars.</HI> I thought before their going, the affairs had been pro|duced to a narrow <HI>Point</HI> (relying upon their general <HI>Propositions</HI>) but when they came to the <HI>matter,</HI> it proved so <HI>Raw,</HI> as if it had been ne|ver treated of, the <HI>Generals</HI> giving them easie way to evade, and af|fording them means to avoid the effecting of any thing.</P>
<P>The <HI>Particulars</HI> that passed in the <HI>Treaty,</HI> I mean not now to dis|cover unto you, the time being too short, I referre that to <HI>Charles</HI> and <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and the <HI>Secretaries,</HI> who shall relate unto you all the <HI>Particulars.</HI> And after that, <HI>Super totam materiam,</HI> I desire your best assistance and advice; what is best and fittest for me to do, for the good of the Common-wealth, the advancement of <HI>Religion,</HI> and the good of my Son, and my <HI>Children</HI> of the <HI>Palatine.</HI> And of <HI>Our E|state</HI> I know you cannot but be sensible, considering your Welfare con|sists in <HI>Ours,</HI> for you shall be sure to have your share in what misery shall befal us, therefore I need to urge no further <HI>Arguments</HI> unto you for your choicest and surest <HI>Counsel.</HI> And I assure you in the faith of a Christian King, that it is <HI>Res integra,</HI> presented unto you, and that I stand not bound, nor any wayes ingaged, but remain free to follow what shall be best advised.</P>
<P>To plant is not sufficient, unless like good <HI>Gardiners</HI> you pluck up the weeds that will choak your <HI>labours</HI>; and the greatest weeds among you are jealousies, root them out: for my <HI>Actions,</HI> I dare avow them be|fore <HI>God,</HI> but jealousies are of a strange depth. I am the <HI>husband,</HI> and you the <HI>wife,</HI> and it is subject to the <HI>wife</HI> to be jealous of her <HI>husband.</HI> Let this be far from you! It hath been talked of my remisness in main|tainance of <HI>Religion,</HI> and <HI>suspicion</HI> of a toleration, but as <HI>God shall judge</HI> me, I never thought, nor meant, or ever in word expressed any thing that savored of it. It is true, that at times best known to my self, I did not so fully put those <HI>lawes</HI> in execution, but did wink, and Con|nive at some things which might have hindred more weighty <HI>Affaires</HI>: But I never in all my <HI>Treaties</HI> agreed to any thing, to the overthrow, or disagreeing of those <HI>Lawes</HI>; But in all I had a chief regard to the preservation of that <HI>Truth,</HI> which I have ever professed. And in that respect as I have a <HI>Charitable</HI> conceit of you, I would have you have the like of me also, in which I did not transgress. For it is a good Horseman's part not alwayes to use the <HI>Spur,</HI> nor keep streight the
<PB N="262" REF="227">
<HI>Reign,</HI> but sometimes to use the <HI>Spur,</HI> and sometimes to suffer the <HI>Reign</HI> more remiss; So it is the part of a <HI>Wise King</HI> (and my <HI>Age</HI> and experience have informed me) sometimes to quicken the <HI>Laws,</HI> with strict <HI>Execution,</HI> and at other times upon just <HI>Occasion</HI> to be more remiss.</P>
<P>And I would also remove from your thoughts all jealousies, that I might, or ever did question or infringe any of your lawful liberties, or privileges; But I protest before <HI>God</HI> I ever intended you should in|joy the fulness of all those, that from antient times give good Warrant and Testimony; of which, if need be, I will inlarge, and amplifie. There|fore I would have you (as I have in this place heretofore told you, as Saint <HI>Paul</HI> did <HI>Timothy</HI>) avoid <HI>Genealogies,</HI> and curious <HI>questions,</HI> and quirks and jerks of <HI>Law,</HI> and <HI>idle</HI> innovations, and if you minister me no just <HI>Occasion,</HI> I never yet was, nor ever will be curious or capti|ous to quarrel with you. But I desire you to avoid all doubts, and hin|drances, and to compose your selves speedily, and quietly, to this weigh|ty affair.

<P><HI>Bristol</HI> still puffs up <HI>Our King</HI> with an assurance both of the <HI>Match,</HI> and restitution of the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> but they proceeding slowly, the <HI>Prince</HI> desired that he might go himself into <HI>Spain,</HI>

which <HI>Buckingham</HI> first broke to the King, who with <HI>Reasons</HI> laid down for it, was drawn to it.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Prince</HI> came there, the <HI>Match</HI> at first was abso|lutely denied, unless he would be converted, which <HI>Bristol</HI> perswaded the <HI>Prince</HI> unto, at least in shew, to expedite his Bu|siness.</P>

<P>By this Letter it appears,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conjectures on the King's Letter.</NOTE> that the King thought the <HI>Petiti|on</HI> against <HI>Recusants</HI> of such high consequence, that if he should
<PB N="266" REF="230">
not give the Parliament a good answer, it might make a <HI>Rupture</HI> with them, and therefore he will see further in the <HI>Nature</HI> of this Petition, before he will break with the King of <HI>Spain</HI>; and know more of the Prince, his Son's mind, happily whether he would yet accept of his Old Mistris, or expect a new one. Or whether the King feared that the Parliament would not make good their Promises, to stand with their lives and fortunes in the <HI>Gap,</HI> when this great Breach was made, and so cousen him, may be <HI>Mystical Conjectures</HI> from <HI>Mystical Expressions,</HI> grounded upon the Words of a <HI>King</HI>: Or whether any or all of these (like the <HI>King</HI>'s Heart inscrutable) are meant in the Letter, is not here determined. But the <HI>King</HI> hastens to the House, and finding no such terrible things in the Petition (the Lords being not so quick in the <HI>Resolution</HI> of it, as the King was in the apprehension of it) he stirs not those Waters, but sounds the depth of the Parlia|ments Intentions, by propounding his Doubts, and requiring a so|lution to them, in order to a War, with prudence and caution.</P>
<Q><P>My Lords and Gentlemen all. I have cause first to thank God with my heart,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>King</HI>'s 2. speech to both <HI>Houses.</HI></NOTE> and all the faculties of my mind, that my speech which I delivered in Parliament hath taken so good effect among you, as that with an <HI>Unamine consent,</HI> you have freely, and speedily, given me your advice in this great <HI>Business,</HI> for which I also thank you all as heartily as I can. I also give my particular thanks to the Gentlemen of the <HI>lower House,</HI> for that I hear, when some among them would have cast jealousies, and doubts, between me and my people, you presently quelled those <HI>Motions,</HI> which might have hindred the happy agreement I hope to find in this Parliament. You give me your advice to break off both the Treaties as well concerning the Match, as the <HI>Palatinate.</HI> And now give me leave as an old King to propound my Doubts, and hereafter give me your answer.</P>
<P>First it is true that I who have been all the dayes of my life a peaceable King, and have had the Honour in my <HI>Titles,</HI> and impress to be stiled <HI>Rex pacificus,</HI> should without neces|sity, imbroil my self in a War. Which is so far from my <HI>Nature</HI> and from the <HI>Honour</HI> I have had both at home and a|broad, in endeavouring to avoid the effusion of <HI>Christian</HI> blood (of which too much hath been shed) and so much a|gainst my <HI>Heart,</HI> that unless it be upon such a necessity, that I may call it (as some merrily say it of Women) <HI>Malum Necessarium,</HI> I shall be loth to enter into it. And I must like|wise acquaint you that I have had no small hopes given me of <HI>Obtaining</HI> better <HI>Conditions,</HI> for <HI>Restitution</HI> of the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> and that even since the setting down of this Parliament. But be not jealous, nor think me such a <HI>King,</HI> that would under
<PB N="267" REF="230">
pretext of asking your advice put a scorn upon you, by disdain|ing or rejecting it. For you remember, that in my first <HI>Speech</HI> unto you, for proof of my <HI>Love</HI> to my <HI>People,</HI> I craved your ad|vice in this great and weighty affair. But in a matter of this <HI>Weight.</HI> I must consider how this <HI>Course</HI> may agree with my <HI>Conscience</HI> and <HI>Honour,</HI> and next, according to the <HI>Parable</HI> uttered by our <HI>Saviour,</HI> (after I was resolved of the <HI>Ne|cessity,</HI> and justness of the <HI>Cause</HI>) to consider how I shall be en|abled to raise <HI>Forces</HI> for this purpose.</P>
<P>As concerning the <HI>Case</HI> of my <HI>Children.</HI> I am now old, and would be glad, as <HI>Moses</HI> saw the Land of <HI>Promise</HI> from a high Mountain (though he had not leave to set his foot in it) so would it be a great <HI>Comfort</HI> to me, that God would so long prolong my daies, as, if I might not see the <HI>Restitution,</HI> yet at least to be assu|red that it would be. That then I might with old <HI>Simeon</HI> say, <HI>Nunc dimittis servum tuum Domine</HI>! Otherwise it would be a great grief unto me, and I should dy with a heavy, and discom|forted <HI>Heart.</HI> I have often said, and particularly in the last Parliament, (and I shall be ever of the <HI>Mind</HI>) that as I am not ambitious of other <HI>Mens</HI> Goods or Lands, so I desire not to en|joy a surrow of Land in <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> without <HI>Restitution</HI> of the <HI>Palatinate</HI>; and in this <HI>Mind</HI> I will live and dy.</P>
<P>But let me acquaint you a little with the difficulties of this <HI>Case</HI>; He is an unhappy man who shall advise a <HI>King</HI> to <HI>War,</HI> and it is an unchristian thing to seek that by blood, which may be had by <HI>Peace.</HI> Besides, I think your Intentions are not to in|gage me in a War, but withal you will consider how many things there are requisite thereunto. I omit to speak of my Own Necessities, they are too well known; Sure I am, I have had the least help in <HI>Parliament</HI> of any King that reigned over you these many years; I have let you know that my disabili|ties are increased, by the <HI>Charge</HI> of my Son's Journey into <HI>Spain</HI> (which I was at for his <HI>Honour,</HI> and the <HI>Honour</HI> of the <HI>Nation</HI>) by sending <HI>Ambassadours,</HI> by Maintenance of my <HI>Children,</HI> and by assisting of the <HI>Palatinate.</HI> I have incurred a great Debt to the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Denmark,</HI> which I am not able to pay. The <HI>Low-Countries</HI> (who in regard of their nearness are fittest to help for the <HI>Recovery</HI> of the <HI>Palatinate</HI>) are at so low an ebb, that if I assist them not, they will be scarce able to subsist. The <HI>Princes</HI> of <HI>Germany</HI> that should do me any good, are all <HI>poor,</HI> and <HI>weak,</HI> and <HI>disheartned,</HI> and do expect assistance from hence. For <HI>Ire|land,</HI> I leave it to you, if that be not a back-door fit to be secu+red. For the <HI>Navy,</HI> I thank God it is now in a better <HI>Case</HI> than ever it was, yet more must be done, and before it can be pre|pared as it ought to be, it will require a new <HI>Charge,</HI> as well for the own <HI>Strength,</HI> as for securing of the <HI>Coasts.</HI> My <HI>Children</HI>
<PB N="268" REF="231">
(I vow to <HI>God</HI>) eat no bread but by my means,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An. Reg.</HI> 22.</NOTE> I must main|tain them, and not see them want.

<P>This being my <HI>Case,</HI> to enter into a <HI>War</HI> without sufficient means to support it, were to shew my <HI>Teeth</HI> and do no more. In the mean time, <HI>I heartily thank you for your Advice, and will seriously think upon it</HI>; As I pray you to consider of these other Points. My <HI>Treasurer,</HI> to whose <HI>Office</HI> it appertains, shall more at large inform you of those things that concern my <HI>Estate.</HI></P>
<P>Thus freely do I open my <HI>Heart</HI> to you, and having your <HI>Hearts,</HI> I cannot want your <HI>Helps</HI>; for it is the <HI>Heart</HI> that opens the <HI>Purse,</HI> not the <HI>Purse</HI> the <HI>Heart.</HI> I will deal frankly with you, shew me the means how I may do what you would have me, and if I take a <HI>Resolution</HI> upon your <HI>Advice</HI> to enter into a <HI>War,</HI> then your own <HI>Deputies</HI> shall have the disposing of the Money, I will not meddle with it, but you shall appoint your own <HI>Treasurers.</HI></P>
<P>I say not this with purpose to invite you to open your <HI>Pur|ses,</HI> and then to slight you so much as not to follow your <HI>Coun|sel,</HI> nor ingage you before I be ingaged my self. Give me what you will for my own means, for I protest none of the <HI>Money</HI> which you shall give for these <HI>Uses,</HI> shall be issued but for those ends. If upon your <HI>Offer</HI> I shall find the means to make a <HI>War</HI> honourable, and sate, (and that I resolve to im|brace your Advice) then I promise you on the <HI>Word</HI> of a <HI>King,</HI> That although <HI>War</HI> and <HI>Peace</HI> be the peculiar Prerogative of <HI>Kings,</HI> yet as I have advised with you in the <HI>Treaties,</HI> on which <HI>War</HI> may ensue, so I will not Treat nor accept of <HI>Peace,</HI> with|out first acquainting you with it, and hearing your Advice, and therein go the proper way of Parliament, in conferring and consulting with you: And happily, <HI>Conditions</HI> of <HI>Peace</HI> will be the better, when we are prepared for <HI>War,</HI> according to the Proverb, <HI>That Weapons breed Peace.</HI></P>
<P>Your kind Carriage gives me much <HI>Contentment,</HI> and that comforts me which my Lord of <HI>Canterbury</HI> said, That there was not a contrary <HI>Voice</HI> among you all, like the <HI>Seventy In|terpreters,</HI> who were led by the breath of <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P>I am so desirous to forget all rents in former <HI>Parliaments,</HI> that it shall not be my default, if I be not in love with <HI>Parlia|ments,</HI> and call them often, and desire to end my life in that intercourse between Me and my People, for making of good
<PB N="269" REF="231">
<HI>Laws,</HI> reforming abuses, and maintaining the good Govern|ment of the <HI>Common-Wealth.</HI> Therefore go on cheerfully, and advise of these <HI>points,</HI> and my <HI>Resolution</HI> shall be then, de|clared.</P></Q>
<P>None can blame the <HI>King</HI> for being too cautelous,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parliament close with the King.</NOTE> or wary in such an <HI>Eruption</HI> as this, so contrary to his <HI>Nature</HI> (as he saith himself) a <HI>War</HI> was a new <HI>World</HI> to him, fearing to lay out by it more than he should receive. And in this, he was like the <HI>Man,</HI> that when his <HI>Master</HI> gave great <HI>Charge</HI> to go and gather up his <HI>Rents</HI> in the <HI>Country,</HI> and to take a pair of <HI>Pistols</HI> with him, to bring home his Money with the more security: After the <HI>Master</HI> had appointed him to pay so much in one place, and so much in another, that the <HI>Man</HI> saw he should not receive so much as he should disburse, <HI>Bid his Master take his</HI> Pistols <HI>again, he should not use them.</HI> So the <HI>King</HI> fearing that when the <HI>War</HI> was begun, there would not be where withal to maintain it, <HI>Thanked the</HI> Parliament <HI>for their Advice, and he would consider better of it.</HI> And they seeling the <HI>King</HI>'s Pulse by his expressi|ons, resolved now not to let him flag, but to keep up the tem|per of his <HI>Spirit,</HI> that a little thing would make decline again. And therefore they seriously settled to their <HI>Business,</HI> and an|swered his <HI>Expectation</HI> fully, which they presented unto him shortly after, in these words, to his great <HI>Satisfaction.</HI></P>

<P>To which Our humble <HI>Petitions</HI> (proceeding from Our most <HI>Loyal</HI> and <HI>Dutiful</HI> affections towards your <HI>Majesty,</HI> Our Care of Our <HI>Coun|tries</HI> good, and our own confident persuasion, that these will much ad|vance the Glory of <HI>Almighty God,</HI> the everlasting <HI>Honour</HI> of your <HI>Majesty,</HI> the Safety of your <HI>Kingdoms,</HI> and the incouragement of all your good <HI>Subjects</HI>) <HI>We</HI> do most humbly beseech your Majesty to vouchsafe a gracious Answer.</P>
<P>The <HI>King</HI> was prepared for the <HI>Petition,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King prepared for it.</NOTE> having given his own <HI>Resolution</HI> the <HI>Check</HI> at present; that whatsoever he might do hereafter, yet now he would comply; and therefore he sends for both <HI>Houses</HI> to <HI>Whitehall,</HI> to sweeten them with a gentle an|swer to this <HI>Petition,</HI> that might take off those <HI>sour</HI> aspersions that this miscarriage in <HI>Government</HI> might happily cast upon him. And we will not say but his intentions might rove to|wards the <HI>End,</HI> though he gave too much <HI>liberty</HI> (through a <HI>Natural</HI> easiness in himself) to those that <HI>He</HI> trusted with <HI>Ma|nagement</HI> of the great affairs, by evil means to pervert that <HI>end</HI>; which made him guilty of their <HI>Actions</HI>: For where true <HI>Piety</HI> is not the <HI>Director, Carelesness</HI> as often as <HI>Wilfulness</HI> carries men out of the way. But he had this <HI>Principle,</HI> and made often use of it, (like ill Tenants when they let things run to ruin) to daub all up again, when forced to it, and find no other <HI>Remedy.</HI> This was the effect of what he said in his own excuse.</P>

<P>My <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Gentlemen</HI> of both <HI>Houses,</HI> I cannot but commend your <HI>Zeal,</HI> in offering this <HI>Petition</HI> to me; yet on the other side, I can|not but hold my Self unfortunate, that I should be thought to need a <HI>Spur</HI> to do that which my <HI>Conscience,</HI> and <HI>Duty,</HI> binds me unto. What <HI>Religion</HI> I am of,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Kings answers to the Parlia|ments Petiti|ons, 23. Apt.</NOTE> my <HI>Books</HI> do declare, my <HI>Profession,</HI> and <HI>Behaviour</HI> doth shew, and I hope in God I shall never live to be thought otherwise; surely I shall never deserve it: And for my part I wish it may be written in <HI>Marble,</HI> and remain to <HI>Posterity</HI> as a mark upon me, when I shall swerve from my <HI>Religion</HI>: For he that doth dissemble with God, is not to be trusted with Men.</P>
<P>My <HI>Lords,</HI> for my part, I protest before <HI>God, That my Heart hath bled</HI> when I have heard of the increase of <HI>Popery. God</HI> is my judge, it hath been such a great grief to me, that it hath been as <HI>Thorns</HI> in my <HI>Eyes,</HI> and <HI>Pricks</HI> in my <HI>Sides,</HI> and so for ever I have been and shall be from turning another way. And my <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> you shall be my <HI>Confessors,</HI> that one way or other it hath been my <HI>Desire</HI> to hinder the growth of <HI>Popery,</HI> and I could not be an honest <HI>Man,</HI> if I should have done otherwise; And this I may say fur|ther, That if I be not a <HI>Martyr,</HI> I am sure I am a <HI>Confessor,</HI> and in some sense I may be called a <HI>Martyr,</HI> as in the <HI>Scripture, Isaac</HI> was <HI>Persecuted</HI> by <HI>Ismael,</HI> by mocking <HI>Words,</HI> for never <HI>King</HI> suf|fered more ill Tongues than I have done, and I am sure for no cause; yet I have been far from <HI>Persecution,</HI> for I have ever thought, that no way increased any <HI>Religion</HI> more than <HI>Persecution,</HI> according to that Saying, <HI>Sanguis Martyrum est Semen Ecclesiae.</HI></P>
<P>Now my <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> for your <HI>Petition</HI>; I will not onely grant the <HI>Substance</HI> of what you craved, but add somewhat more of my own. For the Two <HI>Treaties</HI> being already anulled (as I have declared them to be) it necessarily follows of it self, that which you desire, and therefore it needs no more, but that I do declare by <HI>Proclamation,</HI> (which I am ready to do) That all <HI>Jesuits,</HI> and <HI>Priests,</HI> do depart by a <HI>Day</HI>; but it cannot be as you desire, by Our <HI>Proclama|tion</HI> to be out of all my <HI>Dominions</HI>; for a <HI>Proclamation</HI> here, ex|tends but to this <HI>Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>This I will do, and more, I will Command all my <HI>Judges,</HI> when they go their <HI>Circuits,</HI> to keep the same <HI>Courses,</HI> for putting all the <HI>Laws</HI> in Execution against <HI>Recusants,</HI> as they were wont to do, before these <HI>Treaties</HI>: for the <HI>Laws</HI> are still in <HI>force,</HI> and were never dispensed with by me. <HI>God is my judge, they were never so in|tended by me.</HI> But as I told you in the beginning of the <HI>Parlia|ment,</HI> you must give me leave as a good <HI>Horse-man</HI> sometimes to use the <HI>Reins,</HI> and not always to use the <HI>Spurs.</HI> So now there needs nothing but my <HI>Declaration</HI> for the disarming of them, that is alrea|dy done by the <HI>Laws,</HI> and shall be done as you desired. And more,
<PB N="275" REF="234">
I will take order for the <HI>shameful</HI> disorder of the <HI>Resorting</HI> of my <HI>Subjects</HI> to all forein <HI>Ambassadours</HI>; of this I will advise with my <HI>Council</HI> how it may be best reformed. It is true, that the <HI>Houses</HI> of <HI>Ambassadors</HI> are privileged places, and though they cannot take them out of their <HI>Houses,</HI> yet the Lord <HI>Mayor,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Recorder</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> may take some of them as they come from thence, and make them Examples. Another <HI>Point</HI> I will add, concerning the <HI>Education</HI> of their <HI>Children,</HI> of which I have had a principal care, as the <HI>Lord</HI> of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Winchester,</HI> and other <HI>Lords</HI> of my <HI>Council</HI> can bear me witness, with whom I have advised about this <HI>Business</HI>: For in <HI>good faith</HI> it is a shame their <HI>Children</HI> should be bred here, as if they were at <HI>Rome.</HI> So I do grant not onely your <HI>Desire,</HI> but more: I am sorry I was not the first mover of it to you; But had you not done it, <HI>I should have done it my self.</HI></P>
<P>Now for the second part of your <HI>Petition</HI>; You have there given me the best advice in the World; For it is against the <HI>Rule</HI> of <HI>Wis|dom,</HI> that a King should suffer any of his <HI>Subjects</HI> to transgress the <HI>Laws,</HI> by the intercession of other <HI>Princes</HI>; and therefore assure your selves, that (by the <HI>Grace</HI> of <HI>God</HI>) I will be careful that no such <HI>Conditions</HI> be foisted in upon any other <HI>Treaty</HI> what|soever: For it is fit my <HI>Subjects</HI> should stand or fall to their own <HI>Laws.</HI></P>
<P>If the <HI>King</HI> had seriously and really considered the <HI>Minute</HI> of this <HI>Petition,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King pro|mises much, performs lit|tle.</NOTE>the very last Clause, wherein the <HI>Glory</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> and the <HI>Safety</HI> of his <HI>Kingdoms,</HI> so much consisted, as the <HI>Par|liament</HI> wisely express, and foresee, and which the <HI>King</HI> saith is the best Advice in the <HI>World,</HI> and which he promised so faith|fully to observe in the next <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>Marriage</HI> for his <HI>Son,</HI> it might perhaps have kept the <HI>Crown</HI> upon the <HI>Head</HI> of his <HI>Poste|rity.</HI> But when <HI>Princes</HI> break with the <HI>People,</HI> in those <HI>Pro|mises</HI> that concern the <HI>Honour</HI> of <HI>God, God</HI> will let their <HI>people</HI> break with them to their <HI>Ruin</HI> and <HI>Dishonour.</HI> And this <HI>Maxim</HI> holds in all <HI>Powers,</HI> whether <HI>Kingdoms</HI> or <HI>Common Wealths</HI>; As they are established by <HI>Iustice,</HI> so the <HI>Iustice</HI> of <HI>Religion</HI> which tends most to the <HI>Glory of God,</HI> is principally to be observed.</P>
<P>The <HI>King</HI> grants them more than they desire, but not so much as they hope for: they have many good words thick sown, but they produce little good <HI>fruit.</HI> Yet the <HI>Parliament</HI> followed the <HI>Chace</HI> close, and bolted out divers of the <HI>Nobility</HI> and <HI>Gentry</HI> of <HI>Eminency, Popishly</HI> affected, that had <HI>Earth'd</HI> them|selves in Places of high Trust and Power in the <HI>Kingdom,</HI> as if they meant to under-mine the <HI>Nation.

And when the Treaty was begun, the <HI>Spanish Factors</HI> began to play their parts with the <HI>Pope,</HI> so that he sent to the King of <HI>France</HI> to get some Immunities, in the <HI>Articles</HI> now in <HI>Treaty,</HI> for the <HI>Catholiques</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and that there might be publique exercise of the <HI>Popish Religion</HI> for the <HI>Princess.</HI> This the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Holland</HI> opposing, the King of <HI>France</HI> told him, That if he would go on with the <HI>Treaty,</HI> he would be tyed no further to the <HI>Pope's Rules</HI> than did consist with <HI>Reason</HI>; For he did ac|knowledg the next <HI>Diocesan Bishop</HI> to him, in his <HI>Dominions,</HI> to have as much power as he. So that the <HI>Treaty</HI> went on with a petty admittance of the <HI>Catholique Religion,</HI> and <HI>Romish Ministers</HI> about the <HI>Princess,</HI> to a private, and almost obscure <HI>Condition</HI>; so eager was the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>France</HI> for the <HI>Match.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>Iesuitical Party,</HI> both here, and there, were incessantly laborious for a greater <HI>Liberty,</HI> and the <HI>King</HI>'s chief <HI>Agent</HI> in the <HI>Treaty, Monsieur de Vieuxvill,</HI> having pulled on him the <HI>O|dium</HI> of the people (through some miscarriages) being committed <HI>Prisoner</HI> by the <HI>King,</HI> to protect him from their <HI>Rage,</HI> the <HI>Cardi|nal Richelieu</HI> entring then into his Infancy of <HI>Favour,</HI> being pre|ferred by the <HI>Queen-Mother</HI> to be a manager of the <HI>Treaty,</HI> whose Intimate he was, and more Stubborn for promoting the <HI>Catho|lique Cause,</HI> yet all this could give no stop to the <HI>Career,</HI> but that the <HI>Match</HI> would be made up upon very easie Terms.</P>
<P>But when the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>France</HI> understood by his <HI>Ministers,</HI> and <HI>Agents</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> how eager our King was for the <HI>Match,</HI> (for he desired it above all <HI>Earthly Blessings,</HI> as one near him said of him) for besides the <HI>Reproach</HI> he thought would fall upon him by another <HI>Breach,</HI> he should lose the <HI>Glory</HI> of a <HI>Conjunction</HI> with <HI>Kings</HI> (which he highly wound up his <HI>Opinion</HI> to) to <HI>Sublime,</HI> and, as it were, <HI>Deifie</HI> his <HI>Posterity</HI> in the esteem of the <HI>people,</HI> so that he would almost submit to any thing, rather than the <HI>Match</HI> should not go forward; which the King of <HI>France</HI> find|ing, he bated his <HI>Humour</HI> of earnestness for it, and descended by the same <HI>Steps</HI> and <HI>Degrees</HI> that he found his <HI>Brother King</HI> advan|ced to it; and got several great Immunities for the <HI>Papists</HI> by it: notwithstanding all <HI>Our King's</HI> fair <HI>Promises</HI> to the <HI>Parliament,</HI> as

may be seen by those <HI>Articles,</HI> seal'd and sworn to by <HI>Our King,</HI> some few Months before his <HI>Death.</HI></P>
<P>But a little before this, (when the <HI>Hopes</HI> of the <HI>Match</HI> with <HI>France</HI> began to bud) the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Carlile</HI> was sent over to ma|ture, and <HI>Ripen</HI> the proceedings with the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Holland,</HI> to bring the <HI>Treaty</HI> to some perfection, yet with private instructi|ons, That if they could find by their <HI>Spanish Correspondencies</HI> (as the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Carlile</HI> was a little <HI>Hispanioliz'd</HI>) that the <HI>Match</HI> there had any <HI>Probability</HI> of taking effect with the new <HI>Propositions</HI>; that then they should proceed no further in the <HI>French Treaty</HI>: so earnest was the <HI>King</HI> for the one, so <HI>Violent</HI> for the other; The <HI>Sophisticate Drugs</HI> of the <HI>Spanish Restitution</HI> of the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> having not yet lost their <HI>Operation.</HI> Thus the <HI>Ambition</HI> of <HI>Prin|ces</HI> (that devolve all their <HI>Happiness</HI> upon glorious <HI>Extractions</HI>) doth choak and smother those <HI>Considerations,</HI> that <HI>Religion</HI> (like a clear <HI>light</HI>) discovers to be but gross, and cloudy <HI>Policy,</HI> which vanishes often, and comes to nothing.</P>
<P>The <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Buckingham</HI> swoln with Grandure (having two great <HI>Props</HI> to support him) doubted not to <HI>Crush</HI> any thing that stood in his way,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lord Treasurer questioned in Parliament.</NOTE> so that he fell very heavily upon his <HI>Cou|sen</HI> the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Middlesex, Lord Treasurer</HI>; for he remembred how he repined at the <HI>Moneys</HI> that were spent in <HI>Spain,</HI> and his <HI>Comportment</HI> to him since his coming over (<HI>Middlesex</HI> being naturally of a <HI>Sullen</HI> and proud <HI>Humor</HI>) was not such as (he thought) did become his <HI>Creature:</HI> Therefore he <HI>Resolved</HI> to bring him down from that <HI>Height</HI> he had placed him in, and quickly sound the means to do it. For great <HI>Officers</HI> that dig deep in <HI>Worldly Treasures,</HI> have many <HI>Underminers</HI> under them; and those that are not just to themselves or others, must make use of such as will not be so <HI>just</HI> to them, so that a flaw may easily be found, whereby a great <HI>Breach</HI> may be made. And as <HI>Middle|sex</HI> had not <HI>Innocency</HI> to <HI>Iustifie</HI> himself, so he wanted <HI>Humility</HI> whereby others might <HI>Iustifie</HI> him, which made him fall unpi|tied. The <HI>Prince</HI> (that was <HI>Buckingham</HI>'s right hand) took part against him in the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Lords,</HI> where he was <HI>Questioned</HI>; which the <HI>King</HI> hearing of, writes to the <HI>Prince</HI> from <HI>New-Market,</HI> (whither he often retired to be free, and at ease from comber, and noise of <HI>Business</HI>) <HI>That he should not take part with any</HI> Faction <HI>in</HI> Parliament <HI>against the Earl of</HI> Middlesex, <HI>but to reserve himself, so that both sides might seek him; for if he bandied to take away his Servants, the time would come that others would do as much for him.</HI> This wise Advice speaks <HI>Buckingham</HI> a little declining from the <HI>Meridian</HI> of the <HI>King</HI>'s Favour, or the <HI>King</HI> from his; For if the <HI>King</HI> did know that <HI>Buckingham</HI> was his chief <HI>Persecu|tor,</HI> it could not but relish ill with the <HI>Duke</HI> to have the <HI>King</HI> plead for him; if the <HI>King</HI> did not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> know, there was not

<P>While these things were in Motion, Truth that comes often with a leaden-foot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cruelty at <HI>Amboina.</HI></NOTE> brought <HI>News</HI> out of the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> that the year 1622. gave Birth to a Mischief of so horrid a <HI>countenance</HI> (for a private one) that no <HI>Time</HI> or <HI>Age</HI> could <HI>Parallel.</HI> The <HI>Dutch</HI> (while the <HI>English,</HI> their great <HI>Supporters,</HI> were fighting for them at their own doors) grasping at all the Treasures, and Spices of the <HI>Eastern</HI> World, had not only wormed out the <HI>Spa|niards,</HI> and <HI>Portugals,</HI> from many <HI>Islands,</HI> and <HI>Colonies</HI> there, but (unbounded with Covetousnes and Ambition) strove to hin|der their Neighbours, and best friends the <HI>English,</HI> from that free Commerce with the <HI>Natives</HI> they ever enjoyed, so that many <HI>Bickerings</HI> hapned among them; till the <HI>Controversie</HI> was taken up by publick Treaty, and <HI>Stipulation,</HI> agreed on betwixt Our King, and the <HI>States</HI> of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> in the year one thousand six hundred and nineteen. And according to this a|greement, the <HI>English,</HI> being as they thought secure, planted their <HI>Factories</HI> among them, where, after they had reaped the fruit of their great danger, and hazard, for some two years with much grumbling, and repining, the <HI>Dutch</HI> began to pra|ctise their utter Extirpation: Not by a <HI>Massacre,</HI> for that had been a <HI>merciful Mischief,</HI> but by torture (to make their <HI>Cruelty Iustice</HI>) in so horrid and savage a manner, as if they had sucked their <HI>Rage</HI> from <HI>Indian Tigers.</HI></P>

The racks extending their Sinews, drew them out at length, and the waters which they subtilly forced into their Mouths, by their own respiration, and breathing, swelled all their <HI>Bodies</HI> to a huge <HI>Proportion,</HI> making their very eyes ready to bolt out of their <HI>Heads</HI>; and such whose sturdy innocence would not be compelled to accuse themselves, they burned the soles of their feet with candles, till the moisture which dropt from them extinguished the flame, and with those burning instruments made such holes in their sides, that they might see their en|trails, yet would not see their innocence.

<P>But <HI>Our King</HI> that was very much impatient in his <HI>Health,</HI> was patient in his <HI>Sickness,</HI> and <HI>Death.</HI> Whether he had recei|bed any thing that extorted his <HI>Aguish Fits</HI> into a <HI>Feaver,</HI> which might the sooner stupifie the <HI>Spirits,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King pa|tient in sick|ness.</NOTE> and hasten his end, cannot be asserted; but the <HI>Countess</HI> of <HI>Buckingham</HI> (who trafficked much with <HI>Mountebanks,</HI> and whose <HI>Fame</HI> had no great <HI>savour</HI>) had been tampering with him, in the absence of the <HI>Docto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</HI> and had given him a <HI>Medicine</HI> to drink, and laid a <HI>Plaster</HI> to his side, which the King much complained of, and they did rather exas|perate his <HI>Distemper</HI> than allay it: and these things were admit|ted by the insinuating persuasions of the <HI>Duke</HI> her Son, who told the King they were appoved Medicines, and would do him much good. And though the <HI>Duke</HI> after strove to purge himself for this <HI>Application,</HI> as having received both <HI>Medicine</HI> and <HI>Plaster,</HI> from <HI>Doctor Remington,</HI> at <HI>Dunmow</HI> in <HI>Essex,</HI> who had often cured <HI>Agues,</HI> and such <HI>Distempers</HI> with the same; yet they were <HI>Ar|guments</HI> of a complicated kind, not easie to unfold; considering that whatsoever he received from the <HI>Doctor</HI> in the <HI>Countrey</HI> he might apply to the King what he pleased in the <HI>Court</HI>; besides the <HI>Act</HI> it self (though it had been the best <HI>Medicine</HI> in the World) was a <HI>Daring</HI> not <HI>justisiable</HI>; and some of the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Phy|sicians</HI> mutter'd against it, others made a great noise, and were forced to fly for it; and though the still voice was quickly si|lenced by the <HI>Duke</HI>'s power, yet the <HI>Clamorous</HI> made so deep im|pressions that his <HI>Innocence</HI> could never wear them out. And one of <HI>Buckingham</HI>'s great provocations was thought to be his fear, that the King being how weary of his too much greatness, and power, would set up <HI>Bristol</HI> his deadly enemy against him, to pull him down. And this <HI>Medicine</HI> was one of those 13 <HI>Articles</HI> that after were laid to his <HI>Charge</HI> in <HI>Parliament,</HI> who may be misinformed, but seldom accuse any upon false <HI>Rumor,</HI> or bare <HI>Suggestion</HI>; and therefore it will be a hard task for any man to excuse the King his <HI>Successor,</HI> for dissolving that <HI>Parliament,</HI> to preserve one thar was accused by them for poisoning his <HI>Father.</HI></P>

<P>And besides <HI>Lamb,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Butler</HI> a <HI>Moun|tebank.</HI></NOTE> there was one <HI>Butler</HI> an <HI>Irishman</HI> (which
<PB N="288" REF="246">
vaunted himself to be of the house of <HI>Ormond</HI>) who was a kind of <HI>Montebank,</HI> which the <HI>Duke</HI> and his <HI>Mother</HI> much consided in. This <HI>Butler</HI> was first an <HI>Apprentice</HI> to a <HI>Cutler</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> and before his time expired quitted his <HI>Master,</HI> having a run|ning head, and went to the <HI>Barmudoes,</HI> where he lived some time, as a Servant in the <HI>Island,</HI> and walking by the Sea-side with another of his Companions, they found a great <HI>Mass</HI> of <HI>Ambergreece,</HI> that the Seas bounty had cast up to them, which they willingly concealed, meaning to make their best Markets of it. <HI>Butler</HI> being a subtle <HI>Snap,</HI> wrought so with his <HI>Com|panion,</HI> with promises of a share, that he got the possession of it, and in the next <HI>Dutch</HI> ship that arrived at the <HI>Barmudoes,</HI> he shipt himself and his <HI>Commodities</HI> for <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> where having sold his <HI>Bargain</HI> at a good <HI>Rate,</HI> and made his credit with his fellow Venturer cheap enough, ingrossing all to himself, he came into <HI>England,</HI> lived in a gallant, and noble <HI>Equipage,</HI> kept a great and free <HI>Table,</HI> at his lodgings in the <HI>Strand,</HI> which were furnished suitable to his <HI>Mind,</HI> and had his <HI>Coach</HI> with six <HI>Horses,</HI> and many footmen attending on him, with as much <HI>State,</HI> and <HI>Grandure,</HI> as if his <HI>Greatness</HI> had been real: But though his means lasted not to support this long, yet it brought him into great acquaintance, and being <HI>Pragmatical</HI> in tongue, and having an active pate, he fell to some <HI>Distillations,</HI> and other odd extracting practices, which kept him a float, and some men thought he had gotten the (long-dreamed-after) <HI>Philosopher</HI>'s <HI>Stone</HI>; but the best <HI>Recipe</HI> which he had, to main|tain his <HI>Greatness</HI> after his <HI>Amber</HI> money fumed and vapoured away, was suspected to come from his friends at <HI>White-Hall</HI>; And the <HI>Story</HI> of his <HI>Death</HI> (if it be true) is one great <HI>Evidence</HI> of some secret <HI>Machination,</HI> betwixt the <HI>Duke</HI> and him, that the <HI>Duke</HI> was willing to be rid of him, <HI>For</HI> Mischief, <HI>being an ingrosser, is</HI> Unsecure, <HI>and</HI> Unsatisfyed, <HI>When their Wares are to be vented in many</HI> Shops. Therefore he was recommended upon some plausible occasion by the <HI>Duke</HI>'s means (as same deli|vered it) to some <HI>Iesuits</HI> beyond the <HI>Seas</HI>; where he was en|tertained with a great deal of <HI>specious Ceremony,</HI> and <HI>Respect,</HI> in one of their <HI>Colledges,</HI> or <HI>Cloisters</HI>; and at <HI>Night</HI> they attending him to his <HI>Chamber</HI> with much Civility, the <HI>Chamber</HI> being hang|ed with <HI>Tapestry,</HI> and <HI>Tapers</HI> burning in stretcht-out <HI>Arms</HI> up|on the Walls, and when they gave him the <HI>Goodnight,</HI> they told him they would send one should direct him to his lodging, and they were no sooner out of this <HI>Room</HI> of Death, But the floar that hung upon great <HI>hinges</HI> on one side, was let fall by <HI>Arti|ficial Engins,</HI> and the poor <HI>Vermin Butler,</HI> dropt into a <HI>Preci|pice,</HI> where he was never more heard of. That there are such secret <HI>Inquisition-Conveyances,</HI> of a horrid Nature, is obvious, and such close contrivances may fly up and down upon the
<PB N="289" REF="246">
Wings of <HI>Rumor,</HI> but it is impossible to find out the bottom of such black <HI>Pitfals,</HI> but with as much danger as those that find the bitter effects of them. And this was reported to be the end of <HI>Butler.</HI></P>
<P>But to conclude with Our King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Descrip|tion of King <HI>Iames.</HI></NOTE> whom this do concern. He was born a King, and from that heighth, the less fitted to look into inferiour things; yet few escaped his Knowledge, being, as it were a <HI>Magazine</HI> to retain them. His <HI>Stature</HI> was of the <HI>Middle Size</HI>; rather tall than low, well set and somewhat plump, of a ruddy Complexion, his hair of a light brown, in his full perfection, had at last a Tincture of white. If he had any predominant <HI>Humour</HI> to ballance his <HI>Choler,</HI> it was sanguine, which made his <HI>Mirth Witty.</HI> His Beard was scattering on his Chin, and very thin; and though his Clothes were seldom fa|shioned to the <HI>Vulgar</HI> garb, yet in the whole man he was not uncomely. He was a King in understanding, and was content to have his Subjects ignorant in many things. As in curing the <HI>Kings-Evil,</HI> which he knew a <HI>Device,</HI> to aggrandize the <HI>Virtue</HI> of Kings, when <HI>Miracles</HI> were in fashion; but he let the World believe it, though he smiled at it, in his own <HI>Reason,</HI> finding the strength of the <HI>Imagination</HI> a more powerful <HI>Agent</HI> in the <HI>Cure,</HI> than the <HI>Plasters</HI> his <HI>Chirurgions</HI> prescribed for the <HI>Sore.</HI> It was a hard <HI>Question,</HI> whether his Wisdom, and knowledge, exceed|ed his <HI>Choler,</HI> and <HI>Fear</HI>; certainly the last couple drew him with most violence, because they were not acquisititious, but <HI>Natu|ral</HI>; If he had not had that <HI>Allay,</HI> his high touring, and master|ing <HI>Reason,</HI> had been of a <HI>Rare,</HI> and sublimed <HI>Excellency</HI>; but these earthy <HI>Dregs</HI> kept it down, making his <HI>Passions</HI> extend him as far as <HI>Prophaness,</HI> that I may not say <HI>Blasphemy,</HI> and <HI>Policy</HI> superintendent of all his <HI>Actions</HI>; which will not last long (like the <HI>violence</HI> of that <HI>Humour</HI>) for it often makes those that know well, to do ill, and not be able to prevent it.</P>
<P>He had pure <HI>Notions</HI> in <HI>Conception,</HI> but could bring few of them into Action, though they tended to his own <HI>Preservation</HI>: For this was one of his <HI>Apothegms,</HI> which he made no timely use of. <HI>Let that Prince, that would beware of Conspiracies, be ra|ther jealous of such, whom his extraordinary favours have advanced, than of those whom his displeasure hath discontented. These want means to execute their Pleasures, but they have means at pleasure to execute their desires,</HI> Ambition to rule is more vehement than Malice to revenge. Though the last part of this <HI>Aphorism,</HI> he was thought to practice too soon, where there was no cause for prevention, and neglect too late, when time was full ripe to pro|duce the effect.</P>
<P>Some <HI>Parallel'd</HI> him to <HI>Tiberius</HI> for <HI>Dissimulation,</HI> yet Peace was maintained by him as in the Time of <HI>Augustus</HI>; And Peace be|got
<PB N="290" REF="247">
got <HI>Plenty,</HI> and <HI>Plenty</HI> begot <HI>Ease</HI> and <HI>Wantonness,</HI> and <HI>Ease</HI> and <HI>Wantonness</HI> begot <HI>Poetry,</HI> and <HI>Poetry</HI> swelled to that <HI>bulk</HI> in his time, that it begot strange <HI>Monstrous Satyrs,</HI> against the King's own person, that haunted both <HI>Court,</HI> and <HI>Country,</HI> which ex|prest, would be too bitter to leave a sweet perfume behind him. And though bitter ingredients are good to imbalm and preserve dead <HI>Bodies,</HI> yet these were such as might indanger to kill a li|ving name, If <HI>Malice</HI> be not brought in with an <HI>Antidote.</HI> And the tongues of those times more fluent than my <HI>Pen,</HI> made eve|ry little <HI>miscarriage</HI> (being not able to discover their true Opera|tions, like small seeds hid in earthy <HI>Darkness</HI>) grow up, and spread into such exuberant <HI>branches,</HI> that evil <HI>Report</HI> did often pearch upon them. So dangerous it is for <HI>Princes,</HI> by a <HI>Remiss Com|portment,</HI> to give growth to the least <HI>Error</HI>; for it often proves as <HI>fruitful</HI> as <HI>Malice</HI> can make it.</P>
<P>But alas good King! here was an end of his earthly <HI>Empire,</HI> and little did he imagine that the last <HI>Period</HI> to great <HI>Britain's Monarchy</HI> should not much exceed the time of his own <HI>Reign,</HI> and in the true extent come short of it.</P>

<HEAD>THE CONCLVSION To the discreet <HI>Reader.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HAving now finished (I will not say perfected) my little <HI>Work</HI> of this great King, without <HI>prejudice</HI> to his <HI>Person,</HI> or <HI>Envy</HI> to his <HI>Dignity,</HI> not having (for filthy <HI>lucre</HI> sake) any <HI>Man</HI> in <HI>Admi|ration,</HI> and willing to be less than the least in the <HI>Times</HI> flatuous <HI>opi|nion</HI>: I hope to free my self from that Rigid, censorious <HI>Humour,</HI> that foams in the mouths of such whom the <HI>Venom</HI> of <HI>Passion</HI> hath corrupted, that I may clear the way the better over the <HI>Precipices,</HI> and <HI>prodigious Passages,</HI> that will be found in the next King's reign, which to attempt is a <HI>Daring</HI> inexpressible. For <HI>History</HI> seldom fol|lows <HI>Truth</HI> so near the <HI>Heels,</HI> where a various, and mixed <HI>multitude,</HI> may either pretend to, or really know more, than one man can well <HI>Re|late</HI>; and where <HI>affection</HI> or dislike, to particular men, would willingly co|ver, or sordidly lay open, those <HI>Blemishes,</HI> which may be smear, if not quite deface the living <HI>Character</HI> yet imprinted in their <HI>memories.</HI> For though they that write near the <HI>Times,</HI> are said to write <HI>par|tially,</HI> either for <HI>Fear,</HI> or <HI>Friendship</HI>; yet they that write <HI>Truth,</HI> must either do it from private <HI>Knowledge</HI> or publick <HI>Report</HI>; and who can know better than they that live near the <HI>Times</HI>? according to the <HI>French Proverb; Ce qu'on voit, est plus certain, que ce qu'on oit</HI>; and as <HI>Horat.</HI> saith, <HI>Oculis potius credendum qu&agrave;m auribus.</HI> The waters are the purest at the <HI>Fountain</HI>; they mingle, and gather dross, by running through divers troubled <HI>Chanels.</HI> And as everything in a clear <HI>Spring</HI> will be perspicuous, so the <HI>soil</HI> of <HI>Fals|hood</HI> or <HI>Mistake</HI> (if any be cast into it) will be the more visible. But some may retort the <HI>Argument,</HI> and say, <HI>In troubled fountains</HI> the <HI>Waters</HI> are not so pure as they will be when they are further from the <HI>Spring,</HI> that time may settle them, and then men will take up that which runs clearest. But <HI>nimium altercando Veritas amittitur,</HI> Truth may be lost in a croud. And as all things are not to be spoken, so some things are not to be concealed; for it derogates from the glory of <HI>God</HI> to have his <HI>Justice</HI> obscured, his remarkable <HI>Dispensations</HI> smothered, as if <HI>We</HI> were angry with what the <HI>Divne Power</HI> hath done, who can debase the <HI>Spirits</HI> of <HI>Princes, and is mighty among the Kings of the earth. And though the Priests lips should keep knowledge, yet (as the</HI> Prophet <HI>saith) he can make them contemptible and base before all the people.</HI> And therefore why should we grudge and repine at <HI>God's Actions? for his thoughts are not as our thoughts, nor his wayes as our wayes.</HI> His <HI>Judgments</HI> should teach us <HI>Wisdom,</HI> and his glorious proceedings
<PB N="292" REF="248">
should learn us <HI>Righteousness,</HI> that his. Anger may be turned away from us. And let them that stand take heed lest they fall. For though God rewarded <HI>Jehu</HI> with the <HI>Kingdom,</HI> for the good service he did him, yet because he walked not with him, <HI>God visited</HI> the house of <HI>Jehu,</HI> and laid the blood of <HI>Jezreel,</HI> which he was commanded to shed, upon the head of his <HI>Posterity.</HI> But all the <HI>Arguments</HI> of <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Angels,</HI> will neither penetrate, nor make impression, in some ill-composed <HI>Tempers,</HI> till they are softned with the <HI>fire</HI> of <HI>Love</HI>; and that holy <HI>Flame</HI> is best kindled with <HI>Patience,</HI> by willingly submit|ting to the al-disposing <HI>Providence</HI> that <HI>orders</HI> every thing. Before whose <HI>Altar</HI> (waiting for the <HI>Season</HI> of <HI>Grace</HI>) I will ever bring the best <HI>fruits</HI> of my <HI>Labours.</HI> But if that which I intend should not come to <HI>Perfection</HI> (the day of <HI>man</HI>'s life being but as a <HI>Dawning,</HI> and his time as a <HI>Span</HI>) I will never be displeased with my <HI>Master</HI> (in long and dangerous <HI>Labours</HI>) for calling me away to rest, before my work is done.</P>
