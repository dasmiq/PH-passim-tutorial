<P>_ANtichrist shall be, borne in great Ba+bilon of an Harlot, that shal come of y^e tribe of Da~. He shalbe replenished with y^e deuill in his mothers wo~be. He shalbe nourished with spirituall euils &amp; mischiefes. He shal rule ouer the whole world. He shal subdue all ma~kind vnto him by foure ma~ner of wayes. First he shall bring the co~mon people vnder his dominion by terrour &amp; feare: for he shal exercise great cruelty &amp; tyra~ny against the true worshippers of god. Seco~dly, he shall win vnto him the noble personages, &amp; suche as be in authoritye, by geuyng the~ greate gifts &amp; riches, wherof he shal haue great abou~|dau~ce &amp; plenty: for al the hid mony shal be open vnto him. Thirdly, w^t his wisedome &amp; eloque~ce which shalbe wonderful and incredible, he shal make the clergy to cleaue vnto him: for he shall haue great knowledge of al arts, &amp; of the scrip|ture. Fourthly, thorow signes and wonders he shall deceaue such as despise the world, as mon|kes, &amp; suche like. For he shal shew wonderfull signes and tokens. He shal be thought to cause fyre to come downe from heauen &amp; to consume his aduersaries before him, and to raise vp the dead to geue witnesse of hym. But he shall not rayse vp the dead in deede. But thorowe hys witchcraft and forcery he shall cause the deuill to enter into the body of some damned dead per+so~, &amp; this shal he cary about him, &amp; by this shall he so speake that euery ma~ shall thinke hym to be aliue, as it is written of hym: His comming shall be by the working of Satha~, with al lying power, signes &amp; wonders, &amp; in all deceauable|nesse of vnrighteousnes among the~ that perish.

The Iewes and al misbeleuing persons out of all places of the worlde shall flock &amp; flow vnto him. But thorow the preaching of Enoch and Hely, the people shal forsake him &amp; returne vn|to the true and christe~ religion: wherof shal en|sue greate persecution and manslaughter, in so much that all in a manner shal suffer hard mar|tirdome. He shal rule and obtaine the monarchy by the space of three yeares &amp; an halfe. After|ward he shall pitche his tente in the mou~t Oli|uet to the ende that he may destroy the rightu|ous. But he shall not preuayle. For in the very same mount shal he be found sodenly dead. For he shalbe slaine at the commaundement of God with the breath of the Lordes mouth, as it is written: the Lord shal cast downe Hedlong and vtterly destroye in the holy hill the stoutest gy|aunt of the whole worlde. After these thynges peace and righteousnesses shall spryng vp, and the earth shalbe filled full of the knowledge of the Lorde, so that the Gospell of the kingdome shalbe preached in al the worlde.

When the truth is once come to light, saith Saint Austen, let custome geue place. For who doubteth, that custome ought to geue place to the ope~ truth. Let no ma~ preferre custome before reason &amp; truth: for rea|son and truth doth alwayes put custome to si|lence. We must heare and do that, saith Saint Cyprian, that Christ hath done, &amp; that he hath also co~maunded to be done, seing that he sayeth in his Gospell: If ye do those thynges, that I commaunde you,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ioan.</HI> 15.</NOTE> I will call you no more ser|uauntes, but frendes.

But the shepheardes by Gods iudge|ment were striken vnto death for their presumption thorowe fyre that came downe from heauen. Therfore the ho|ly fathers haue decreed, y^t those words should be spoken in silence, forbiddyng all men vnder payne of excommunica|tion, that no man presume to speake those wordes, but priestes onely when they are at the altar, yea and that at Masse: agayn, when they haue on their Massing garmentes.</P>

<P>_PRiestes are worthye to be honoured of all men, for the dignitie,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Math, xviii</HI></NOTE> whiche they haue of GOD.

wordes of consecration, the breade is transsubsta~tiated &amp; turned into y^e true body of Christ. Secondly as the blessed Virgine after shee had broughte forth Christ, dyd beare hym in her handes, &amp; layde hym in y^e maunger: so likewyse y^e priest after the consecration immedi|atly lyfteth vp the body of Christ, and laieth him down again, &amp; beareth him, &amp; handleth him in his hands. Thirdly, as y^e blessed Virgine was sa~ctifyed in y^e wombe, before she conceaued Christ: so likewise y^e priest receaueth orders &amp; is annoynted, before he consecrateth.</P>
<P>For without taking orders he could consecrate nothing: and therfore a lay|man although he be neuer so holy can do nothing in this matter, although he should pronounce the wordes of conse|cration. In consideration whereof, we must know,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A massing priest is more excel|lent than an Aungel. Note.</NOTE> y^t the dignitie of priests af|ter a certayne manner doth farre excel the dignitie of Angels. For power to make y^e body of Christ is geue~ to none of the Angells, so that the baseste and moste inferioure prieste in the worlde can doe that, whiche the greatest and highest Aungell in heauen can not do.

Therefore Barnarde sayeth: O the worshipfull dignitye of priestes, in whose handes the Sonne of God as in the Virgines wombe is incarnate. Wherefore Austen sayeth, that in the consecration of the holy hoste all the heauenly courte serueth hym, that is to say, the priest: and the Lorde of hea|uen commeth downe vnto hym. Am|brose therefore also sayth writing vp|on Luke:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Priests ar to be hono|red aboue all Kyngs.</NOTE> Doubte thou not, but y^t the Angels are there present, when Christ is present vpon the altare: so y^t priests are to be honoured aboue all Kinges,<NOTE PLACE="marg">&lindx;</NOTE> Princes, Knyghtes and men of Nobili|tie.

<P><HI>Fyrst,</HI> Priestes are aboue all Kynges and Princes of the earth, as God say|eth by Ieremye: I haue set thee thys daye ouer Nations and Kingdomes. And this to bee true, appeareth thus. The dignitye of the prieste is such and so great, y^t it lyeth in his power to con|secrate and make Kinges: but all the Kynges of the worlde are not able to make one Priest. And for a profe there|of, that priestes be greater and of farre more excellencye, than Kinges are: it is to be noted, y^t there is no Prince so greate, whiche doth not bowe downe hys necke in confession to the Prieste, and humble hymselfe before the priest as before God, being in dede Goddes vicare. Therefore God oute of hands exalted the Priestes aboue al men, and aboue all creatures, as a certaine Doc|tor sayth, speakyng of Priestes.

<PB REF="182">
and vnto men, as the Apostle saith: All Au~gels are ministring spirits. So like|wise is it the dutye of priestes to serue God day &amp; night,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hebr.</HI> 1.</NOTE> and to minister vnto men, with the Sacramentes.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The eyght dignitie of Priestes.</NOTE><HI>Eyghtly,</HI> God hath honored y^e priests in this, that they are in some poyntes like to the most blessed virgine Mary.

Third|ly, as the blessed virgine was sa~ctified in her wombe,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 46.</NOTE> before she conceaued Christ, as it is written: The most high hath sa~ctified his tabernacle: so in like manner the priest receaueth holye or|ders, before he co~secrateth: for he could not consecrate, excepte he were orde|red.

<P><PB REF="183"><NOTE PLACE="marg">The ninth dignitie of priestes.</NOTE><HI>Ninthly,</HI> God hath honored the prie|stes aboue Aungels, yea, and somwhat also aboue the dignitie of blessed Mary the virgine.<NOTE PLACE="marg">&rindx;</NOTE> First in the dignitie of ke|ping. For a priest is bound to kepe ma+ny soules, as the Byshop is bounde to looke vpon al the diocesse, and the Po|pe the whole worlde, and the Curate hys parishe, as Bernarde saith: O how worthy kepers are they, which so care|fully watche, that they may kepe the soules that are committed vnto them from euerlastyng death. But an Aun|gell hath but one soule committed vn|to hym for to kepe, as Bernarde testi|fieth: Great is the dignitie of soules, that euery one of them euen from the very tyme of their birth, shoulde haue an aungel appointed for to kepe them. Secondly, in taking and touchyng the body of Christ. The angels doe but see God,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Math.</HI> 18. The priest maketh God, ha~d|leth God, and cateth God.</NOTE> as it is written: Their aungels see the face of my Father, whiche is in heauen. But in this is the priest grea|ter than the Au~gell: for he doth but see God, but the priest handleth hym, yea and eateth him, which was neuer giue~ to any Aungell so to do, but it sufficeth
<PB N="154" REF="183">
hym to beholde God. Thirdly, in con|secratyng the bodye of Christe. And in this point the priest doth not onely ex|cell the Aungels, but also after a cer|tayne manner Marye the Mother of Christ: so that the lessest priest on earth is able to do that, whiche the greatest Aungell in Heauen can not doe. Ther|fore saith Barnarde: O the dignitie of priestes worthy to be had in great re|uerence, in whose handes as in the wombe of the Virgine the Sonne of God is incarnate. Austen also saith: In the consecration of the holye host the whole court of Heauen doth seruice to the priest, yea, and the Lorde of heauen commeth downe vnto him. Likewyse saith Ambrose vpo~ Luke: Doubt thou not, but that Aungels are there prese~t when Christ is present on the altare, &amp; whe~ he is offered: so y^t Christ may well say to euery priest, y^t which is writte~ in Esay:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Esay.</HI> 5.</NOTE> What coulde I haue done, more for thee, &amp; haue not done it?

great honour. But contrary to this do all they, that dishonour priestes: and in this they greuouslye offende God, as <HI>Henricus de vrimaria</HI> writing vpon the fourth commaundement saith: Wo be vnto them and euerlasting damnation hangeth ouer their heades, that do dis|honour priestes, speake euill of them, diffame &amp; backbite them:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against the backbiters of Priests.</NOTE> for they cruci|fie the Sonne of God againe.

<HEAD>Of the vertues of the Masse.</HEAD>
<P>THe masse hath xii. vertues,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The .xii. vertues of the masse.</NOTE> as it is specified in a certaine booke called <HI>The signification of the Masse,</HI> imprin+ted in the Englishe tounge by Robert Wier, <HI>Cum priuilegio regali ad imprimen|dum solum.</HI></P>
<P>The first vertue or frute of the masse is, as some doctours do write, y^t a man doth merite more whiles that he doth beare masse deuoutly, than if he should geue for gods sake as muche grounde and lande, as he coulde passe &amp; go ouer y^e space of y^e same masse, O what may be then deserue, which doth heare eue|ry daye .iii. or .iiii. masses? And what doth he lese, and what compte shall he make afore God at the daye of iudge|ment, whiche hath not so greate busi|nesse, but that he may heare one masse at the least euery daye? O what shall it greue you, that ye haue lost so muche? This ye shal vndersta~d according to y^e dignitie and excelle~tnesse of the masse.</P>
<P>The second vertue is,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 9<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> that the holy aungels be glad to be nighe vnto y^e per+son in kepyng hym, whe~ he hath heard
<PB REF="238">
masse as Dauid sayth, god dyd co~mau~d his Aungels to kepe and preserue you in all your wayes and busines.</P>
<P>The thirde vertue is, y^t the man be|holding with deuotio~ &amp; reuere~ce y^e holy Sacrament in the masse as S. Austen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aith, god doth geue him y^e fame day al thynges necessary for hys body. Item vaine wordes &amp; vnaduised othes be for geuen &amp; pardoned, and he is preserued from sodayne death. A man doth lese no tyme, while that he doth heare masse. All the steps in commyng and in goyng be compted of the holy Aun|gell. And if the man dye the same daye that he hath herd masse without recey|uyng the Sacrament, God shall compt it as spiritually receaued.</P>
<P>The fourth vertue is, that a person beyng in sinne, oftetimes in the Masse tyme by the presence of the holye Sa|crament,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Luke. xxiii Luke. vii.</HI></NOTE> doth receaue a good inspira|tion, so that from thenceforth he doth conuert hym from hys sinnes: as the good theef vpon the crosse, Mary Mage+dalene afore the feete of our Lord. If they had not bene present with oure Lorde peraduenture they shoulde not
<PB N="210" REF="238">
haue had pardon of their sinnes.</P>
<P>The fifte vertue or fruite is, that a man hearing masse deuoutly, recea|ueth spiritually the Sacrame~t, so that he desire it deuoutlye. And so it maye chaunce, that a man hearyng masse de|uoutlye, shall obtayne more grace&punc; than the priest whiche doth it. For the priest is not alwayes equally well dis|posed. And so may a man euery day re|ceaue the holy Sacrament spiritually&punc;</P>
<P>The sixte vertue is, that the man hearyng Masse, and beyng in the state of grace, is partaker of all the masses done thorowout all the worlde. And that is more or lesse, after as the man is in the loue and fauour of God. For it is one of the Articles of the holy Ca|tholike faith, as in the Communion of the holy Churche.</P>
<P>The seuenth vertue is, that the prayer of them whiche do heare Mass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is sooner hearde and accepted of God in the masse tyme, than at any other tyme. For then the priest and the holye Aungels, which beabout the altare, do helpe you to pray.</P>
<P>The eight vertue is, that the soules
<PB REF="239">
being in Purgatory, whiles y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the man doth heare Masse, and doth pray for the~ haue a singular absolution, during the same Masse. For there is nothing that doth bryng them so shortly out of the paines of purgatory, as to cause to say or to heare deuoutly Masse for them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">&rindx;</NOTE>The ninth vertue is, that it is better to heare one masse in our life time, tha~ to cause an hundred to be sayd or heard for vs after our death. And y^e it is bet|ter that a man cause a masse to be sayd for him in his lyfe, than an hundred af|ter his death: the reason is this. For a ma~ may now deserue and merite much with a Masse, but not after his death. For then he doth only finde y^e, whiche he hath deserued in his life. And hun|dred thousand masses now done, ca~ not augment one moment of glory &amp; ioye after this time. But by a masse, whiche I doe heare, I may obtayne that I shal not come in Purgatory. But after our death, the masse deliuereth onely from Purgatorye. Is it not better then, not to come in purgatory, than when a ma~ is there, to tary and looke for ayde and helpe to be deliuered.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="239">The tenth vertue is, y^e a woman hea|ring masse deuoutly, if it chaunce, that shee do laboure of childe the same day, she shall be deliuered without faulte y^e more easely and with lesse payne.<NOTE PLACE="marg">&lindx;</NOTE> For the holy Aungels be very busye and di|ligent about her. Therfore al women being with childe (if it be possible) shall heare masse euery day. For by the ver|tue of the masse, y^e frute or childe is pre|serued. And they shall put their trust in the sacrament, and in oure blessed La|dye the Mother of God, and in none other thing.</P>
<P>The eleuenth vertue is, y^t al thyng that a ma~ doth enterprise after he hath heard masse, shall prosper and come to good end: agayne, y^e whiche the man doth eate &amp; drinke after he hath heard masse, shal profyt more to the necessi|tye of nature.</P>
<P>The twelfth vertue is, y^t if the man die the same day y^t he hath heard masse God shal geue hym a singulare grace, which otherwyse he shoulde not haue had, that is to say, that God hymself or his Aungells at the laste houre of hys death, shal helpe &amp; comfort hym as the
<PB REF="240">
man hath serued God at y^e masse. For it is written in the holy Gospel: With what measure ye haue measured:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Math.</HI> vii.</NOTE> with the same also I wil measure you euer|lastingly. <HI>AMEN.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The ver|tues of the masse out of y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Festiual.</NOTE>In the Festiuall also we reade thus concerning this matter. S. Austen say|eth, y^t it profiteth greatlye all Christen people for to heare masse, and specially for nyne causes, and sayth in this man|ner of wise.</P>

<P>The second cause is, al venial sinnes be forgeuen hym by the vertue of the masse, and idle wordes.</P>
<P>The thirde is, y^t if a man die: it shall stand hym for hys housell.</P>
<P>The fourth, he shal not y^t day l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">se his syght.</P>
<P>The fifte, al idle othes that daye shal

<P>The sixt, y^t nay he shall die no sodain death.</P>
<P>The seuenth, as long as he heareth masse, he shall not waxe olde.</P>

<P>The nynth, al the while y^t he behol|deth the blessed sacrament, all wicked spirites flee from hym, and haue no power ouer him, be he neuer so greate a synner.</P>

<P>_ABout Absolution is to be co~|sidered the due or proper &amp; perfect forme.

For al though I know any secret mat|ter, which I publish to many: although al they thorowe my declaration know it: yet in me alone or in my mynd there is neuer the more augmentation for al this. The thyrde miracle is, y^t the body of God is dayly receaued and eaten, &amp; yet is there made no dimunicion or le|sing therof. The reason. If a thousand candles be lighted at my candle, yet is there neuer the lesse light in my candle The widowe of Sarepta also did eate &amp; yet was there neuer the lesse meale in her pot nor oyle in her pytcher.<NOTE PLACE="marg">4, <HI>Reg. iiii.</HI></NOTE> The fourth miracle is, y^t the thyng which is indiuisible and can not bee deuided,
<PB REF="289">
is notwithstanding deuided &amp; remay|neth whole &amp; perfect in euery part of y^e sacrament. This is proued by reaso~. In a glasse, wherin any thing is represen|ted &amp; shewed, although it be deuided by parts, yet in euery one of the~ is y^e same thing represented. The fift miracle is, y^t the body of God taken &amp; receaued of the wicked, is not defiled. The reaso~ is this. For neither is the sunne shining vpo~ fylthy places defiled, or made anye thing y^t worse. The sixt miracle is, y^t the body of Christ, which is the meate of life, bringeth death to sinners. Rea|so~ proueth this to be true. For those meats, which ar good &amp; wholesome, as capons &amp; good wine are hurtfull to the~ y^t are sicke &amp; feble in body. The seuenth miracle is, y^t the bodye of Christ being receaued of the priest, or of any other, y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mouth of the receauer being shut, is ta+ken vp into heaue~. Reaso~ proueth this For Christ came out of the body of the virgine vncorrupt. He rose also out of the graue being shut. Agayn, he came into the house, where y^e Disciples wer gathered, the doores being shut. The eyght miracle is, y^t although the body
<PB N="261" REF="289">
of Christ bee in comprehensible, &amp; can+not be measured, yet it is contayned in so little an hoste. This maye be proued by this reaso~. Theapple of y^e eye, which is very little, comprehendeth a great thing. The ninthe miracle is, y^t one &amp; the self same whole bodye is in diuerse places,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">biqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ty of christs bodye.</NOTE> and is receaued of diuerse at one time. The reason. For the word of ma~ also once vttered &amp; spoke~ according to the nature of the voyce, is al whole to|gether in y^e eares of diuerse. Moreouer he y^t made the body &amp; the place, maketh both to be in the one, as he willeth. A|gayne, the Moone &amp; the Sunne, &amp; the light are in diuerse places, &amp; are seene of diuerse. The tenth miracle is, y^t the bread being transubsta~tiated &amp; turned into the substance of y^e body of Christ, y^e accidentes of the bread do remayne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The mon|strous and vnreasona|ble doctrine of transub|stantiation. <HI>Fabula sin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> capite,</HI></NOTE> y^t is to say, the weight, y^e coloure &amp; the sa|uor. To shewe a reason in this behalfe by any similitude we can not. The le|uenth miracle is, y^t vnder the kinde of bread both is, &amp; is receaued the body &amp; bloud of Christ, yea whole Christ. Like+wise vnder the kinde of wine is recea|ued both the body and bloud of Christ.

<P>If it be demaunded, what it is y^t the mouse eateth when shee knaweth and byteth the sacrament: or what is con|sumed to ashes, when the sacrament is burnt. Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> the thyrd answe|reth and saith: euen as the substance of bread is miraculously turned &amp; conuer|ted into the body of our Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An homely shifte and a soule.</NOTE> when it beginneth to be vnder y^e sacrament: so likewise after a certayn manner mira|culously it retourneth and commeth a|gayne, when the same body ceaseth to be there not y^t that substance of breade co~meth agayne, which was turned in|to the fleshe of Christ, but in the stead thereof an other thyng miraculouslye is made, although suche accidentes might be without a subiecte and so ea|ten. <HI>Guilielmus Durandus.

<P>Both the good and the euil eate the bodye of Christ:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Corin. xii.</HI></NOTE> but the good vnto sal|uation, the euell vnto condemnation. For excepte the euill also dyd eate the

<P>But what becommeth of the bodye of Christ, when it is receaued and ea|ten?

And so long as y^e corporal sense is affected, the corporal presence is not taken away. But after y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the corporall sense in receauing fayleth: the corpo|rall presence is no more to be soughte, but y^e spirituall presence is to be retay|ned. For whe~ y^e dispensation is ended, Christ goeth fro~ y^e mouth to the heart. For it is better that he goeth forth vn|to the minde, than that he shoulde goe downe vnto the bellye. For he is not the meate of the fleshe, but of the soule.

He co~meth to be eaten, not to be co~su|med: to be tasted, not to be incorpora|ted. He is eaten w^t the mouth, but he is not digested in the stomacke: he refre|sheth the minde, but he goeth not oute into the draught. <HI>Ibidem.</HI></P>
