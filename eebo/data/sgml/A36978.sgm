<P>THE FOOL Turn'd Critick: A COMEDY:</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<L>HE who comes hither with design to hiss,</L>
<L>And with a bum revers'd, to whisper Miss,</L>
<L>To comb a Perriwig, or to shew gay cloathes,</L>
<L>Or to vent Antique non-sence with new oaths,</L>
<L>Our Poet welcomes as the Muses friend;</L>
<L>For hee'l by irony each Play commend.</L>
<L>Next these we welcome such as briskly dine,</L>
<L>At <HI>Locket's,</HI> at <HI>Gissord's,</HI> or with <HI>Shataline.</HI></L>
<L>Swell'd with Pottage, and the <HI>Burgundian</HI> Grape,</L>
<L>They hither come to take a kindly nap.</L>
<L>In these our Poet don't conceive much harm;</L>
<L>For they pay well, and keep our benches warm.</L>
<L>And though scarce half awake, some Playes they dam,</L>
<L>They do't by Whole-sail; not by Ounce, and Dram.</L>
<L>But when fierce Criticks get them in their clutch,</L>
<L>They're crueller then the Tirannick Dutch.</L>
<L>And with more Art, do dislocate each Scene,</L>
<L>Then in <HI>Amboyna</HI> they the limbs of men.</L>
<L>They wrack each line, and every word unknit,</L>
<L>As if they'd find away to cramp all Wit.</L>
<L>They are the terror of all adventurers here,</L>
<L>The very objects of their hate and fear,</L>
<L>And like rude Common-wealths they still are knit</L>
<L>'Gainst English Plays, the Monarchyes of wit,</L>
<L>They invade Poetique Lisence, and still rail</L>
<L>At Plays, to which in duty they should vail.</L>
<L>Yet still the' infest this Coast to fish for jests,</L>
<L>To supplement their Wits at City feasts.</L>
<L>Thus much for Criticks: to the more generous Wit,</L>
<L>Our Poet Frankly, does each Scene submit;</L>
<L>And begs your kind Allience to ingage</L>
<L>Those Hogen interlopers of the Stage.</L>

<P>No; but when a Lady writes to a man she do's not; and sends it by a Gentleman; and in her Letter terms the said Gentleman with the terms of sweet Mr. such a one, Dear Mr. such a one, Worthy Mr. <HI>A.</HI> and the like; what should a man think, is not this Love?

<P>Common Civility will allow of praises, especially if we think our selves oblig'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>But praises with such attributes Madam, There's the point. Praise is the Friend of Love: And that Woman that praises a mans parts, undoubtedly covets what she commends; as we extol that Beau|ty most we desire to enjoy.</P>

<P>And can you think, if I did ever love you, which assure your self I do not, I could ever be brought to confess it, when you upbraid me thus; no, I look upon you as a man unworthy&mdash;base, and ill|natur'd&mdash;and perhaps unmanly&mdash;I'le curb him in a little, though my heart akes for't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Sir, though I see in your Phrases a great deal of Wit and Gallantry; yet if I may presume, you are too poynant, your fancy flowes to so extream a deluge, as 'twould o'rewhelm the Age: You look Sir, too sharply into the nature of things, and are, I doubt not, a great Philosopher; but Sir&mdash;</P>

<P>O sye, no indeed Sir, but I see my Brother has been too talkative of my concerns: Yet this committing it to the bosom of a person of so much merit and worth, as your actions sufficiently de|monstrate you to be, has in some measure released my doubt, I well know|ing the extraordinary Perfections Heaven has bestowed on you, espe|cially in concealing the secret of a person extreamly sensible of For|tunes bounty, in permitting the honour to be enroll'd among the the number of your admirers.</P>

<L>OLd Plays, like Mistresses long since enjoy'd,</L>
<L>Long after please whom they before had cloy'd;</L>
<L>For Fancy chews the Cud on past Delight,</L>
<L>And cheats it self to a new Appetiet.</L>
<L>But then the Second Fit comes not so strong,</L>
<L>Like second Agues, neither fierce nor long:</L>
<L>What you have known before, grows sooner stale,</L>
<L>And less provokes you, then an untold tale.</L>
<L>That but refreshes what before you knew,</L>
<L>But this discovers something that is new;</L>
<L>Hence'tis, that at new Plays you come so soon,</L>
<L>Like Bride-grooms, hot, to go to Bed e're noon!</L>
<L>Or, if you are detain'd some little space,</L>
<L>The stinking Footman's sent to keep your place.</L>
<L>But, when a Play's reviv'd, you stay and dine,</L>
<L>And drink till three, and then come dropping in;</L>
<L>As Husband after absence, wait all day,</L>
<L>And decently for Spouse till bed time stay,</L>
<L>So, e're the Brethren's liberal fit was spent,</L>
<L>The first wise <HI>Nonconformists</HI> under-went</L>
<L>With ease, and batten'd in imprisonment.</L>
<L>For greater gains, his zeal refus'd the less;</L>
<L>Each day to him was worth a Diocess.</L>
<L>But he who now, in hopes of equal gain,</L>
<L>Will needs be Pris'ner, tryes the trick in vain;</L>
<L>He melts in durance half his Grease away,</L>
<L>To get, like us, poor thirteen Pounds a day.</L>
