<P>THE OBLIGATION Resulting from the OATH of SUPREMACY, To Assist and Defend the Pre-eminence or Prerogative OF THE Dispensative Power BELONGING To the KING, his Heirs and Successors. In the asserting of that Power various Historical Passages occurring in the Usurpation after the Year 1641. are occasionally men|tioned; And an Account is given at large of the Progress of the Power of Dispensing as to Acts of Parliament about Religion since the Refor|mation; and of divers Judgments of Parliaments declaring their Appro|bation of the Exercise of such Power, and particularly in what concerns the Punishment of Disability, or Incapacity.</P>

His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and one of His Majesty's most Honorable Privy Council in both King|doms of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_AS the <HI>Historian</HI> hath told us of <HI>Ireland,</HI> that long ago while the Arts and Sciences were ge|nerally banish'd from the Christian World they were enthroned in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and that Men were sent thither from other Parts of Chri|stendom to be improved in Learning; so I have elsewhere observ'd that in some late Conjunctures (and particularly during the turbid Interval of the <HI>Exclusion</HI>) men might well be sent to <HI>Scotland</HI> to learn <HI>Loyalty.</HI></P>
<P>And I having taken occasion in the first Part of this Dis|course to shew my self a just honourer of that Country, and (as I may say) somewhat like a Benefactor to it by sending thither the notices of some pass'd great Transactions that might possibly there give more light and life to the Moral Offices of Natural Allegiance or Obedience, did hold my self obliged in Common Justice to address this Part of my Work to your Lordship. For as your Station here quali|fies you beyond other Subjects to receive what Tribute is offer'd to your Country, so your handing it thither will ne|cessarily make it there the more acceptable.</P>
<P>And when I consider with what an incomparable Tender|ness for the Monarchy and its Rights so many of the <HI>Sta|tutes</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> since the <HI>Year</HI> 1660. have been adorn'd, I am apt to think that any matter of Presidents or Records by me recover'd out of the Sea of time where they lay so long useless and neglected, and now happening to be serviceable
<PB REF="3">
to those Moral Offices before-mention'd, would by the so many in that Kingdom devoted to consummate Obedience and Loyalty, be more valued then if I could have imported into that Realm another such Treasure as that which lay so long buried in the <HI>Ocean</HI> near the <HI>Bahama Islands,</HI> and that whoever Contributed to your Loyal Country any Substan|tial Notions that might enrich it in the discharge of the Duties of the <HI>born</HI> and <HI>sworn</HI> Allegiance, would be esteem'd there as some way sharing in the honour of <HI>Arauna,</HI> in <HI>giving like a King to a King.</HI></P>
<P>Long may your great Master live happy in the Enjoy|ment of the faithful Services of so vigilant a Minister as your Lordship, who by the universality of your Knowledge ac|company'd with universal Charity for all Mankind, have appear'd to be born, as I may say, for the time of his most glorious Reign, the time chosen by Heaven for Mercies Triumph on Earth.</P>
<P>Nothing vulgar was to be expected from a Person of your Lordship's extraordinary intellectual and moral Endowments, and in whom the <HI>Loyalty</HI> and other Virtues of your many noble Ancestors have (as it were) lived <HI>extraduce.</HI> And the World would be unjust to you if it acknowledged not its great Expectation answer'd by your greater Performances, and particularly by your having been so eminently Ministe|rial in the Easing both the Cares of your Prince, and of all his Subjects too by the Figure you have made in promoting the Ease of his People's Consciences, and in further enno|bling and endearing the Name of <HI>DRUMMOND</HI> by your Lordship's Prosecuting that by the Bravery of Action, which the <HI>HISTORIAN</HI> of that your Name did by Words, when he transmitted to Posterity the most Christian and Statesman|like <HI>Speech</HI> of Liberty of Conscience, I know extant, and as spoke by a <HI>Roman-Catholick</HI> Councellor in <HI>Scotland</HI> to King <HI>Iames</HI> the <HI>Fifth.</HI></P>

<P>IN this Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> so naturally of old addicted to <HI>Re|ligion</HI> and vehemence in it, as to give a Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> cause to complain, he had more <HI>trouble</HI> given him by <HI>Applications</HI> from <HI>England</HI> about it, then from all the World beside; and afterward to make <HI>Geneva</HI> wonder at the <HI>Sabbatarians</HI> here ex|ceeding the <HI>Iewish</HI> strictness; and to cause <HI>Barclay</HI> in his <HI>Eu|pho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">mio</HI> to say of the English, <HI>Nec quicq&uacute;am in numinis cultu modicum possunt,</HI> and that our several <HI>Sects</HI> thought <HI>unos se Coelestium rerum partici|pes, exortes coeteros omnes esse:</HI> did you ever observe, hear or read of the <HI>style</HI> of <HI>Tenderness of Conscience</HI> so much <HI>used</HI> as in the <HI>year</HI> 41. and some|time afterward?</P>

<P>I have not. From the <HI>Date</HI> of King <HI>Charles</HI> the First's <HI>Declaration to all His loving Subjects</HI> about that time, wherein he speaks of his Care for <HI>Exemption of Tender Consciences,</HI> till the <HI>Date</HI> of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second's <HI>Declaration</HI> from <HI>Breda,</HI> wherein the <HI>Liberty</HI> of <HI>Tender Con|sciences</HI> is Provided for, the <HI>clause</HI> of easing Tender Consciences ran through the Messages, Addresses, and Answers that passed between King and Parliament almost as much as the <HI>Clause</HI> of <HI>proponentibus legatis</HI> did run through the <HI>Councel</HI> of <HI>Trent.</HI></P>

<PB N="2" REF="4" MS="y">
Arch-bishop in his <HI>Speech</HI> in the <HI>Parliament</HI> of 40 who said, <HI>Our Sovereign is, I will not say above other Princes, but above all Christian men that ever I knew or heard of, a man of most upright, dainty, and scrupulous Conscience, and afraid to look upon some Actions, which other Princes abroad do usually swallow?</HI> and he might have added, a <HI>Prince</HI> the <HI>real</HI> Tenderness of who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e Conscience had so often favour'd the <HI>nominal</HI> tenderness of others, who in|stead of being <HI>Tender-hearted Christians,</HI> were <HI>Stiff-necked Iews;</HI> and who might justly apprehend that it was only <HI>duritia cordis,</HI> instead of <HI>Tenderness</HI> of <HI>Conscience</HI> he <HI>dispens'd</HI> with, and as when God <HI>dispens'd</HI> with the <HI>Iews</HI> in <HI>Polygamy.</HI></P>
<P>For since <HI>Tenderness</HI> of <HI>Conscience</HI> doth necessarily render a man abste|mious from things lawful, and to be of a gentle submissive temper not only to his Equals, but Inferiors, and to be <HI>merciful</HI> even to <HI>brute</HI> Crea|tures, and not only averse from suing any one about <HI>Penal</HI> Lawes, but ready to remit somewhat of his <HI>Right</HI> rather then to go to <HI>Law</HI> with a Stranger, and much less with ones Father; the <HI>Pater Patrioe</HI> seeing any men outraging the Lawes, and the quiet of the whole Realm by that wilde brutish thing call'd War, (for <HI>ferinum quiddam bellum est</HI>) might well judge them utterly devoid of all <HI>Tenderness</HI> of <HI>Conscience.</HI> I shall therefore frankly tell you, that no doubt but their Consciences were extremely <HI>erroneous,</HI> or rather <HI>sea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ed.</HI></P>
<P>Our great Writer of Conscience, Bishop <HI>Sanderson</HI> in his <HI>Sermon</HI> on <HI>Rom.</HI> 14. 13. discussing the Causes from which mens doubtfulness of mind may spring, and saying that <HI>sometimes it proceeds from Tenderness of Con|science, which yet is indeed a very blessed and a gracious thing,</HI> doth very well add, <HI>but yet (as tender things may sooner miscarry) very obnoxious through Satan's diligence and subtlety to be wrought upon to dangerous incon|veniences.</HI></P>
<P>And if we Consider that a <HI>Civil</HI> War cannot be lawful on both Sides, however a <HI>foreign</HI> one may, we may well account that any deluded <HI>melan|choly</HI> People who were tempted to raise a Civil War out of a blind Zeal for Religion, and to assault the <HI>Thirteenth</HI> of the <HI>Romans</HI> out of the <HI>Apocalypse,</HI> had <HI>hard</HI> Spleens instead of <HI>tender</HI> Consciences, and that they have <HI>soft</HI> Heads instead of <HI>tender</HI> Hearts, who try to make Religion a gainer by War.</P>
<P>But indeed the <HI>Project</HI> of planting Religion and Propagating the Church by War, that is described to be <HI>Status humanoe Societatis disso|lutoe,</HI> and that so presently opens to all mens view the horrid Scene of <HI>Contempta Religio, Rapta profana, Sacra profanata,</HI> is so vain, that the old <HI>Proverbial</HI> Impiety of such who did <HI>castra sequi</HI> how victorious soever, hath naturally help'd to make <HI>Conquering</HI> Nations embrace the very <HI>Religion</HI> of the <HI>Conquered;</HI> a thing <HI>exemplify'd</HI> in the Conquests of the <HI>Danes</HI> and <HI>Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ns</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> of the <HI>Gothes</HI> in <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> and of the <HI>Moors</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> and in the <HI>Turks</HI> having overcome the <HI>Sara|cens,</HI> embracing the <HI>Saracens</HI> Religion.</P>
<P>And the Vanity of Reforming the World by War, that Profound and Conscientious Statesman Cardinal <HI>D'Ossat</HI> in his Third Book, <HI>86th</HI> Letter and to <HI>Villeroy,</HI> A. 1597. hath well taught us, and where he mentions how he urged to the <HI>Pope</HI> the reasonableness of <HI>Harry</HI> the <HI>4th's,</HI> so religiously ob|serving the great <HI>Edict</HI> of <HI>Pacification, and that the many Wars made again and again by Hereticks, serv'd for nothing but in many places to abolish the Catholick Religion, and in a manner all Ecclesiastical Discipline, Iustice, and Order, and to introduce Atheism with the Sequel of all sorts of Sacri|leges, Parricides, Rapes, Treasons and Cruelties, and other sorts of wicked|ness,</HI> &amp;c. and afterward that on <HI>the making War, all the Malecontents, all</HI>

<P>How did that Pious Prince sometimes in relation to his Heterodox Prote|stant Subjects imitate the <HI>Father</HI> of the <HI>Prodigal,</HI> who <HI>when his Son was yet afar off, ran to meet him, fell on his neck and kiss'd him,</HI> a thing acknow|ledg'd by an Eminent learned Divine, Mr. <HI>Iohn Ley</HI> in his <HI>Book</HI> call'd <HI>De|fensive Doubts, Hopes and Reasons,</HI> Printed in the year 1641. and where in <HI>p.</HI> 123. urging the <HI>Bishops</HI> to procure the <HI>Revocation</HI> of a late <HI>Canon</HI> of the Church, and having said <HI>wherein if they appear and prevail, they need not fear any disparagement to their Prudence by withdrawing that they have de|creed, since the wisest Statesmen and greatest Governors have used many times to comply so far with popular Dispositions, as to vary their own Acts with re|lation to their liking, as the Pilot doth his Soils to comply with the wind,</HI> he addeth, <HI>And you cannot have a more authentic Example both to induce you to this, and to defend you in it from all Imputations, then that of our Sacred Sovereign, who rather then he would give any Colour of Complaint for ag|grievances to his People,</HI> was pleas'd <HI>to DISPENSE with the five Articles of</HI> PERTH's <HI>Assembly, and to discharge all Persons from urging the Practice thereof upon any either Laick or Ecclesiastical Person whatsoever, and to free all his Subjects from all Censures and Pains whether Ecclesiastical or Secular, for not urging, practising, and obeying any of them, <HI>tho they were es<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ablish'd both by a General Assembly, and by Act of Parliament.</HI> King</HI> Charles <HI>his large <HI>Declaration of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">umults in</HI></HI> Scotland, <HI>p</HI> 370. &amp; <HI>p.</HI> 389. <HI>And for his OWN Acts (for these Articles of</HI> Perth <HI>were propounded and ratify'd in the Reign of his Royal Father) he imposed the Service Book, the Book of Canons, and high Commission upon his Subjects in</HI> Scotland, <HI>and upon their humble Supplication, was content graciously to grant a Discharge from them: passing his Princely Promise that he would neither then nor after|wards press the Practice of them, nor any thing of that nature, but in such a fair and legal way, as should satisfie all his loving Subjects.

<HI>sute, which in all submissive manner we tender to your Lordship (and by you to the rest of your Reverend Order) we hope you will do so, since we have it upon his word (His Royal Majesty's word, which neither in Duty nor Discretion we may distrust) that the Prelates were their greatest Friends (i. e.</HI> of his <HI>Scottish</HI> Subjects) <HI>their Councels were always Councels of Peace, and their Solicitations vehement and earnest for granting those unexpected Favours which we were pleas'd to bestow upon our People.</HI> The <HI>King's</HI> large <HI>Declaration,</HI> p. 420</P>
<P>Thus then the Royal <HI>Dispensation</HI> with the five <HI>Articles</HI> of <HI>Perth</HI> was at the <HI>Intercession</HI> of the <HI>Bishops,</HI> tho' they knew the same Establish'd by <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament,</HI> graciously afforded to his <HI>Scotish</HI> Subjects.</P>
<P>Those <HI>Articles</HI> of <HI>Perth</HI> related to various Religionary Matters, <HI>viz</HI> The <HI>introducing of Private Baptism, Communicating of the Sick, Episcopal Con|firmation, Kneeling at the Communion, and the observing such ancient Festi|vals as belong'd immediately to Christ:</HI> and of which Doctor <HI>Heylin</HI> in his <HI>History of the Presbyterians</HI> having spoken saith, <HI>That the King's indulging the</HI> Scots <HI>in Dispensing with the Penal Laws about them, was an Invitation to the</HI> Irish <HI>Papists to endeavour by armed force to Compass the King's Dis|pensation.</HI></P>
<P>But how tenderly the <HI>Consciences</HI> of the Roman Catholics in <HI>Ireland</HI> were in the Reign of the <HI>Royal Martyr</HI> THEN Protected under the <HI>Wing</HI> of the <HI>Dispensative Power,</HI> contrary to what the <HI>Dr.</HI> observ'd, any one may see who will Consult <HI>my Lord Primate</HI> Bramhal's <HI>Replication to the Bishop of Chalcedon,</HI> where he saith, That <HI>the Earl of</HI> Strafford <HI>Lord Lieutenant of</HI> Ireland <HI>did commit much to my hands the Political Regiment of that Church for the space of Eight years. In all that time let him name but one Roman Catholic that suffer'd either Death or Imprisonment, or so much as a pecuniary Mulct of Twelve Pence for his Religion upon any Penal Statute, if he can, as I am sure he cannot,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And such was the acquiescence of the <HI>Populace,</HI> and of <HI>the three Estates</HI> in the Penal Lawes there against the <HI>Roman Catholics</HI> being thus dead or asleep, that in the Printed <HI>Articles of Impeachment against the then Lord Chancellor of</HI> Ireland, <HI>and that Lord Primate th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">n Bishop of</HI> Derry, <HI>and</HI> others of His <HI>Majesty's</HI> Publick <HI>Ministers</HI> of State exhibited by the <HI>Commons</HI> to the <HI>Lords</HI> in the <HI>year</HI> 1640. there is not a <HI>syllable</HI> of Complaint against those <HI>Lawes</HI> being so <HI>dispens'd</HI> with by Connivence.</P>
<P>Nor yet in the Printed <HI>Schedule</HI> of <HI>Grievances</HI> of that Kingdom <HI>voted</HI> in the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Lords</HI> there to be transmitted to the <HI>Committee</HI> of the same <HI>House,</HI> then attending in <HI>England</HI> to pursue <HI>Redresses</HI> for the same, is there any representation of such <HI>Indulgence</HI> being any <HI>Gravamen,</HI> nor yet of the great Figure the <HI>Irish</HI> Papists then made in the Government, the <HI>Majority</HI> of the <HI>Parliament,</HI> and of the <HI>Iudges</HI> and <HI>Lawyers</HI> then being such.</P>
<P>And pursuant to that Prince's <HI>Indulgence</HI> offer'd to the <HI>tender</HI> Consciences of his Subjects in the <HI>year</HI> 41. he was graciously pleas'd in the <HI>Treaty</HI> at <HI>Ux|bridg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> to order his <HI>Commissioners</HI> who were such renown'd <HI>Confessors</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> to make the first Royal <HI>offer</HI> there <HI>that freedom be left to all Persons of what Opinion soever in Matters of Ceremony, and that all the Pe|nalties of LAWS and Customs be SUSPENDED.</HI></P>
<P>And the truth is, since the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion did in its <HI>first</HI> settlement so rationally provide for its Propagation in the World, and its bespeaking the favour of Princes by its enjoyning <HI>Subjection</HI> and Obedience to their <HI>Lawes,</HI> not only for <HI>Wrath,</HI> but <HI>Conscience</HI> sake; and since that <HI>Principle</HI> of <HI>humane Lawes binding the Conscience</HI> (which was so often and so publickly <HI>avow'd</HI> by that <HI>Prince</HI> and Arch-bishop <HI>Laud,</HI> and Bishop <HI>Sanderson</HI> and the <HI>Divines</HI>

of the Church of <HI>England</HI> in General) is the surest guard to Princes <HI>Thrones</HI> and their <HI>Tribunals;</HI> and that therefore 'tis the Interest of the <HI>Prince</HI> and <HI>People.</HI> to be more watchful in preserving that <HI>Principle</HI> then all the <HI>Iewels</HI> of the <HI>Crown,</HI> or <HI>Walls</HI> of the Kingdom: that <HI>Prince</HI> did therefore necessa|rily take Care to preserve and to perpetuate in some of his <HI>tender-Consci|enced</HI> Subjects, a continued <HI>Tenderness</HI> for his <HI>Lawes</HI> by his lawful <HI>Dispen|sative</HI> Power (as particularly in the <HI>Case</HI> of his <HI>Scottish</HI> Subjects) in taking off the <HI>Obligation</HI> of <HI>Obedience,</HI> and of Conforming themselves to the Esta|blish'd Lawes; for such <HI>Dispensation</HI> intrinsecally notes the <HI>taking off</HI> such Obligation from the Persons dispens'd with. And it is indeed a <HI>Solecism</HI> for any one to ask <HI>Indulgence</HI> from a <HI>Prince</HI> who owns the <HI>Law</HI> of the <HI>Land,</HI> binding him in <HI>Conscience;</HI> if he doth not think such Prince per|swaded that his Power of granting it is a part of that <HI>LAW.</HI></P>
<P>He was not ignorant of his <HI>Father</HI>'s Aversion against the <HI>Penal</HI> Lawes in general, and on which Account my Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> celebrating him, saith, <HI>As for Penal Lawes which lie as snares upon the Subjects, and which were as a</HI> Nemo scit <HI>to King</HI> Henry 7. <HI>it yields a Revenue which will scarce pay for the Parchment of the King's Records at</HI> Westminster.

A. 1613. he was judicially admonished by the <HI>High Commission,</HI> that <HI>saving the Catechizing of his own Family only, he should not afterward Preach, Cate|chize, or use any of the Offices or Function of a Minister publickly or privately <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> he should be lawfully restored and releas'd of his said Suspension.</HI> But shortly after the beginning of the Reign of the Royal Martyr, he was <HI>again restored;</HI> and was afterward again <HI>silenced,</HI> and so continued till <HI>August</HI> 2. A. 1631. and then he was again <HI>restored.</HI> And Mr. <HI>Dod's Life</HI> represents his Case as parallel with this before-mention'd. He was in King <HI>Iames</HI> his time <HI>suspended</HI> and <HI>restored,</HI> and again by the <HI>King's</HI> particular <HI>Command</HI> disabled from Preaching, and was by King <HI>Charles</HI> the First <HI>re-ennabled</HI> or <HI>restored.</HI></P>
<P>Thus as <HI>fortis fortem amat,</HI> one <HI>tender Conscienced</HI> man too loves ano|ther such; and the Executive Power of the Law in <HI>re-ennabling</HI> after temporary <HI>Disability,</HI> was <HI>tenderly</HI> administred by these our Princes to <HI>these</HI> Conscientious Men, with respect to their real Capacity of Favour to be shew'd them.</P>

<P>You have here given me a taste <HI>en passant</HI> of <HI>part</HI> of the Dispensative Power, as exercised in the <HI>three</HI> Realms during some Conjunctures in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the First, and for which I thank you, and particular|ly for what you told me of the <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> dispens'd with in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="6">
of which I never heard before; and am apt to suppose a thing of that Na|ture was never done before in that Realm.</P>

<P>I can assure you, to those who know the Publick Transactions of that Kingdom, the thing will not in the least seem new. I can tell you that on the <HI>26th</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> A. 1593. King <HI>Iames</HI> the 6th of <HI>Scotland</HI> made an <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>State</HI> in favour of three Roman-Catholick Earls, <HI>Huntly, Arroll</HI> and <HI>An|gus,</HI> by which Act he allow'd them several Priviledges, contrary to <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> made against Roman-Catholicks. And His Majesty in his Act of State expresly <HI>dispenseth</HI> with those <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Parliament:</HI> and which <HI>Dispensation</HI> tho Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> importuned him to revoke (and for that purpose sent the Lord <HI>Zouch</HI> as her <HI>Embassador</HI> to him) he still adhered to the Act of State he had made, and continued his <HI>Dispensation.</HI></P>

<P>Have you this Matter of <HI>Fact</HI> out of any of the <HI>Records</HI> in <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Scotland?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have it out of the <HI>Original</HI> Papers under the hand of Queen <HI>Eliza|beth</HI> and her great Minister <HI>Burghly,</HI> and the Original Instructions of the Lord <HI>Zouch</HI> when sent by her to expostulate with the King about it, that were lately in my Custody, and by me sent to our gracious <HI>Sovereign:</HI> and I shall some other time give you a more particular account of that <HI>Dispensation.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>But (I beseech you) did not the <HI>Protestant</HI> Divines of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> then cry out of the <HI>unlawfulness</HI> or <HI>inexpedience</HI> of that <HI>Dis|pensation?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have read it in a learned Book of Dr. <HI>Maxwell</HI> a Scotch-man, Printed <HI>A.</HI> 1644. (and who was then Bishop of <HI>Killally</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and had formerly been Bishop of <HI>Rosse</HI>) that Mr. <HI>Robert Bruce</HI> one of the <HI>Ministers</HI> of <HI>Edenburgh,</HI> and who had a great <HI>sway</HI> in the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> was pleas'd with the King's extending his Favour to <HI>Angus</HI> and <HI>Arroll,</HI> but out of a <HI>factious</HI> Complyance with the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Arguile,</HI> was displeas'd at its being shewn to <HI>Huntly.</HI> But that Loyal <HI>Bishop</HI> there acquiesceth in the reason of State, that inclined the <HI>King</HI> to Pardon the <HI>three Earls,</HI> and his there|by hindering the <HI>growth</HI> of <HI>Faction</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and providing for his more easie and secure access to the <HI>Throne</HI> of <HI>England</HI> on the Death of Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI></P>
<P>And so you may easily guess what sort of men in <HI>Scotland</HI> look'd with an <HI>evil eye</HI> on that <HI>Act</HI> of the Royal <HI>goodness,</HI> and who did not. The <HI>Bi|shop</HI> there had applauded the great depth of the King's <HI>Wisdom,</HI> and his <HI>transcendent Goodness</HI> in the <HI>Pardoning</HI> the three <HI>Earls,</HI> and mention'd that <HI>there was nothing of Religion in the Case of</HI> Bruce's <HI>Aversion against the Par|don of</HI> Huntly, <HI>for that</HI> Angus <HI>and</HI> Arroll <HI>were as bigot Papists, if not more then</HI> Huntly.</P>
<P>I can likewise direct you to my Lord Primate <HI>Bramhal</HI>'s celebrated Book call'd <HI>A Fair warning to take heed of the Scotish Discipline,</HI> where in <HI>Chap.</HI> 6. thus entituled, <HI>viz. That it robs the Magistrate of his Dispensative Power;</HI> he saith by way of instance, <HI>When the Popish Earls of</HI> Angus, Hunt|ly, <HI>and</HI> Arroll, <HI>were excommunicated by the Church, and forfeited for Trea|sonable Practices against the King, it is admirable to read with what Wisdom, Charity, and Sweetness his Majesty did seek from time to time to reclaim them from their Errors,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and on the other side to see with what bitterness and radicated Malice they were prosecuted by the Presbyteries and their Commissioners,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>sometimes threatning that they were resolv'd to pursue them to the uttermost, tho it should be with the loss of all their Lives in one day,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>sometimes pressing to have their Estates confiscated,</HI> &amp;c. He refers there in his Margin to <HI>Ass. Edinb.</HI> 1594.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">But any one who shall consult <HI>D'Ossat's Letters,</HI> and there in the <HI>Second Book</HI> carefully read over the 37th <HI>Letter</HI> that was writ to <HI>Villeroy</HI> in the year 1596, and three years after the Date of King <HI>Iames</HI> his <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>State,</HI> and observe what that great Sagacious <HI>Cardinal</HI> there refers to concerning the Circumstances of those <HI>three</HI> Earls, and how all the Prudence that could be shewn by man, was but little enough for the Conduct of that King in that Conjuncture, in order to his removing what Impediments either from <HI>Rome</HI> or <HI>Spain,</HI> or his <HI>Native</HI> Country might obstruct his Succession to the Crown of <HI>England;</HI> will not wonder at his having <HI>dispens'd</HI> and continued his <HI>Dispensation</HI> as aforesaid.</P>

<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not yet ask'd you whether the <HI>Divines</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> did not <HI>lift up their voices like a Trumpet</HI> against the <HI>Dispensative</HI> Power thus exercised by their Prince, as you have mention'd?</P>

<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>They discharged their Duties in Preaching occasionally against all growing Errors: but they wanted none to mind them of the Saying, <HI>Im|pium esse qui Regi dixerit, Inique agis.</HI> The Pious and Learned <HI>Author</HI> of <HI>Certain Considerations tending to Peace,</HI> &amp;c. mentions how the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>St. Davids</HI> in King <HI>Iames's</HI> Reign, A. 1604. did in a set <HI>Speech</HI> in <HI>Convo|cation</HI> shew, that <HI>Ministers were not in the late Archbishop's time disabled from their Ministry on the Account of Non-conformity to the Ceremonies by Law enjoyn'd;</HI> and concluded his <HI>Speech</HI> with the <HI>motion</HI> of <HI>Petitioning</HI> the <HI>King,</HI> That <HI>if the removal of some of the Ceremonies enjoyn'd could not be ob|tain'd, nor yet</HI> a Coleration <HI>for them of more stay'd and temperate Car|riage, yet at least there might be procured a mitigation of the Pe|nalty,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And as the <HI>Suspension</HI> or <HI>Disabling</HI> of <HI>Hildersham</HI> and <HI>Dod</HI> from their Ministerial Functions, so the <HI>Restoring</HI> of them to the same without all such things done by them as the strictness of the Lawes required, was in both those Princes Reigns <HI>executed</HI> by the <HI>Bishops.</HI></P>
<P>Nor do I remember to have read of any <HI>Divine</HI> of the Church of <HI>England</HI> to have in the least look'd with an <HI>evil eye</HI> on the <HI>goodness</HI> of the <HI>Dispensa|tive</HI> Power in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the First being extended to par|ticular Persons; but the hated <HI>Sibthorpe,</HI> who in his <HI>Sermon</HI> of <HI>Apostolick Obedience</HI> (as he call'd it) doth speak of <HI>Mens being bound to observe the Lawes of the Land where they live, except they will suffer as busie bodies, or except they will have that inconvenience granted, that the general Lawes or Government of a Nation must be <HI>dispens's withal,</HI> according to the par|ticular Conceit and Apprehension of every private Person: whereout what <HI>Coleration</HI> of Heresy, what <HI>Connivence</HI> at Errors, what danger of Schisms in the Church and Factions in the State, must necessarily follow,</HI> &amp;c. and ha|ving mentioned <HI>the Liberty of a few erroneous Consciences bringing the Bon|dage of many regulated Commands,</HI> he saith, <HI>We must prefer the general before the particular, and not let every one be loose to their List and Affection, but all</HI> must <HI>be kept within the Lists of their Duty and Subjection.</HI></P>
<P>And I but just now told you of that Prince's avowing&punc; that the <HI>Bishops</HI> advised him to the tenderness he shewed in <HI>dispensing</HI> with his Lawes, to gratifie the pretended tenderness of the Consciences of some of his <HI>Scotish</HI> Subjects in that Conjunct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">eand by which <HI>Dispensing</HI> one would have thought they might have been sufficiently <HI>antidoted</HI> against the <HI>strong Delusions</HI> of entring into <HI>War</HI> for <HI>Religion.</HI></P>
<P>Oh that such <HI>thoughts</HI> had been then impress'd on their Minds, as are contain'd in the <HI>General Demands of the Ministers and Professors of</HI> Aber|dene, <HI>p.</HI> 29. as I find them <HI>cited</HI> in the <HI>Book</HI> of Mr. <HI>Ley</HI> before-mention'd,
<PB N="8" REF="7">
viz. <HI>There be other means more effectual for holding out of Popery (and so of any unlawful innovation) in which we ought to Confide more then in all the Vowes and Promises of Men, yea, also more then in all the United Forces of all the Subjects of this Land, to wit, diligent Preaching and Tea|ching of the Word, frequent Prayer to God, humbling of our selves before him; and Amendment of our Lives and Conversations, and Arming our selves against our Adversaries by diligent searching of the Scriptures, whereby we may encrease in the knowledge of the Truth, and in ability to defend it against the Enemies of it.</HI></P>
<P>Oh that the <HI>Demagogues</HI> of those times had caus'd such words then to have been <HI>writ</HI> in our Churches, or I might rather wish that those <HI>Heads</HI> of Parties had had themselves then <HI>hearts</HI> of <HI>flesh,</HI> and that such <HI>tender</HI> words had been like a <HI>Law</HI> written <HI>there.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>Urgentia imperii fata</HI> were upon us; and that <HI>delicate</HI> use of <HI>Conscience</HI> that is in 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 13. 5. call'd <HI>examen vel probatio nostrum ipso|rum,</HI> and whereby it resembled the <HI>best</HI> property of a <HI>beam</HI> in Scales, namely its <HI>tenderness,</HI> and <HI>turning</HI> with the least part of a <HI>grain,</HI> was among the great <HI>Actors</HI> in that Rebellion quite laid aside, and all the <GAP DESC="foreign"> i. e. <HI>the weightier Matters of the Law</HI> did not stir their Consciences: and the great <HI>Obligation</HI> of their <HI>Oaths of Allegiance</HI> and <HI>Supremacy</HI> signify'd no more then the <HI>dust</HI> of the <HI>balance.</HI></P>
<P>Tho they pretended to so nice a <HI>Tenderness</HI> about any thing that look'd like an <HI>Oath</HI> in <HI>familiar</HI> discourse and was not one, as at the Saying <HI>in faith,</HI> or <HI>in troth,</HI> and so would seem to come under <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Character of <HI>him that feareth an Oath,</HI> (but as to which words of <HI>in faith,</HI> or <HI>by my faith,</HI> our Judicious <HI>Sanderson de Iuramento</HI> makes them amount to no more then a meer <HI>Asseveration,</HI> or at the most an <HI>Obtestation;</HI> and saith, <HI>that the ge|nuine interpretation of the words,</HI> by my faith, <HI>whether in an assertory or pro|missory matter is this, I speak from my heart, I pawn my faith to you that the thing is so</HI>). yet they at the same time would <HI>ridicule</HI> or <HI>seize on</HI> any one who had told them of what they were <HI>Sworn</HI> to in the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Alle|giance,</HI> and of the <HI>recognition</HI> they made there, as the <HI>words</HI> of that <HI>Oath</HI> are, <HI>heartily, willingly and truly <HI>upon the true faith of a Christian.</HI></HI></P>

<P>There was a <HI>Solemn League and Covenant</HI> afterward took by those who had so apparently outraged the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Allegiance,</HI> and it was taken gene|rally by all the Layety and Clergy of the <HI>Parliaments</HI> Party; and was there not a general <HI>Tenderness</HI> of Conscience express'd then in the observance of that <HI>Covenant?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the course of my Observation of Men and Things, some things have more particularly occurred to me to shew you that the great Takers and imposers of that <HI>Covenant</HI> did as plainly and without any seeming re|morfe outrage their <HI>Oath</HI> in that <HI>Covenant,</HI> as they did their <HI>Oaths</HI> of <HI>Alle|giance</HI> and <HI>Supremacy.</HI> For after they had first sworn to <HI>endeavour to pre|serve the Reformed Religion in the Church of</HI> Scotland <HI>in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline, and Government,</HI> and then sworn <HI>to endeavour to reform Reli|gion in these Kingdoms of</HI> England <HI>and</HI> Ireland <HI>in all Points, according to the Examples of the best Reformed Churches;</HI> and so were bound to <HI>reform us</HI> according to the <HI>Pattern</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> (for <HI>that</HI> Church must necessarily pass for the <HI>best</HI> Reform'd <HI>Church,</HI> that stands in need of no <HI>Resormation,</HI> being to be <HI>preserv'd</HI> by them in the State it was) the <HI>Parliament</HI> instead of set|ling in <HI>England</HI> the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Government which then in <HI>Scotland,</HI> had within its <HI>Verge</HI> four Judicatories, and all pretended to be <HI>founded</HI> on <HI>Divine Right.</HI> 1. A <HI>Parochial Session.</HI> 2. A <HI>Presbyterian Consistory.</HI> 3. A <HI>Provin|cial Synod.</HI> 4. A <HI>General Assembly,</HI> as they were bound to, did in effect settle
<PB N="9" REF="7">
<HI>ERASTIANISM</HI> (a <HI>Tenet,</HI> or <HI>hypothesis</HI> of Church-Government that the <HI>Scotch</HI> and <HI>English</HI> Presbyterian <HI>Divines</HI> avowed as great an ha|tred of as of <HI>Popery</HI> it self; <HI>Erastianism</HI> giving the <HI>Supreme</HI> Power in Eccle|siasticals to the <HI>Civil</HI> Magistrate) and in their Printed <HI>Votes</HI> and <HI>Orders</HI> reproved the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Divines for challenging an <HI>Arbitrary</HI> Power, and which they would not grant, <HI>nor set up ten Thousand Iudicatories within the Kingdom,</HI> as the <HI>Parliaments</HI> words were: referring to the Scots <HI>Parechial</HI> Session, where a competent number of <HI>Lay-Elders</HI> (whom they call <HI>Presbyteri non docentes</HI>) and <HI>Deacons</HI> proportionable to the Pre|cinct and Extent of the Parish are conjoyn'd, and which associate Body thus compacted is the <HI>Spiritual</HI> Parochial <HI>Sanhedrim.</HI></P>
<P>But this very <HI>first</HI> Point of that Church-Government, the Parliament hin|der'd Presbytery from gaining here, and opposed its moving in that lowest Sphere of the <HI>Parochial</HI> Session of setling so many Thousand Ecclesiastical <HI>Courts</HI> of <HI>Pye-Powder</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and whereby it could never hope to climb up to the <HI>Primum mobile</HI> of a <HI>General Assembly,</HI> which in reality was the <HI>Sphere</HI> the <HI>Parliament</HI> it self moved in.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Prynne</HI> who was one of the greatest Champions for that <HI>Covenant,</HI> was yet an Eminent profess'd <HI>Erastian,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Coleman</HI> a Member of the <HI>Assembly</HI> of Divines, another of those Champions for the <HI>Covenant,</HI> was likewise a declared <HI>Erastian,</HI> and a great <HI>Favourite</HI> of the Parliaments, and whose frequent <HI>Sermons</HI> before them for <HI>Erastianism</HI> were Printed by their Order; and which <HI>Sermons</HI> of his,&punc; and likewise his Books writ for it were with great heat impugned in <HI>Print</HI> by Mr. <HI>Gillespy</HI> a <HI>Divine</HI> of <HI>Scot|land,</HI> and one of the <HI>Commissioners</HI> in <HI>England</HI> for that Kingdom: and who in a Printed <HI>Sermon</HI> of his Preach'd before the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Lords,</HI> doth call <HI>Erastus <HI>the great Adversary;</HI></HI> and in one of his <HI>Pamphlets</HI> against Mr. <HI>Cole|man,</HI> call'd <HI>Nihil Respondes,</HI> mentions how <HI>the Presbyterians and Inde|pendents were both equally interessed against the Erastian Principles.</HI></P>
<P>And as to the greatness of the number of the <HI>Covenanters</HI> out of <HI>Parlia|ment</HI> that rejected the <HI>Iure-divinity</HI> of the <HI>Scots</HI> ruling <HI>Elders,</HI> Mr. <HI>Cole|man</HI> gives us his Judgment in <HI>p.</HI> 12. of his <HI>Reply to Nihil Respondes,</HI> viz. that 9/10 <HI>of the Assembly, and</HI> 900/1000 <HI>of the Kingdom denyed a Ruling Elder to be an instituted Officer</HI> jure divino.</P>
<P>But <HI>Heylin</HI> having told us in his <HI>History of Presbytery,</HI> That <HI>Presbytery did never setle its Lay-Eldership in any one Parish in</HI> England: we may easily thence suppose the <HI>National</HI> Violation of that National <HI>Covenant,</HI> without any apparent regret of Conscience on that account.</P>
<P>How all the <HI>Independent</HI> Clergy and Layety who had took the <HI>Covenant</HI> did in a manner <HI>simul &amp; semel</HI> most notoriously violate it, in setting up the <HI>model</HI> of their Church-Government is not unknown.</P>
<P>But indeed, as the very sagacious <HI>Author</HI> of the <HI>Book</HI> call'd, <HI>The main Points of Church-Government,</HI> &amp;c. Printed in <HI>London,</HI> A. 1649. hath ob|serv'd, <HI>The known sense of the Scotish Nation which framed the Covenant, and for whose Satisfaction the Covenant was here taken, doth include Inde|pendency under the name of Schism, or at least under those words contrary to sound Doctrine; and our Independent Divines could not but know this to be their sense of it, and yet we know of none that did protest against it, or explain themselves otherwise at the first taking of the Covenant, if they have done it since.</HI></P>
<P>And I might further tell you, that after the <HI>Engagement</HI> was set up of being <HI>true and faithful to the Common-wealth of</HI> England <HI>as it is now Esta|blish'd without a King or House of Lords;</HI> tho several of the Presbyterian
<PB N="10" REF="8">
<HI>Divines</HI> out of a sense of their <HI>Oaths</HI> and <HI>Allegiance,</HI> and their <HI>Covenant</HI> were so <HI>Loyal</HI> as to refuse it, I have not heard of any of those Independent ones who did.</P>
<P>But such was the Inundation of Practical Atheism in the Kingdom that our Civil Wars had caus'd, that when the <HI>Engagement</HI> was set up, almost the whole Body of the <HI>Lawyers</HI> in <HI>England</HI> took it rather then they would lose their <HI>Practice.</HI> These men knew the meaning of the <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> con|taining the <HI>Oaths</HI> of <HI>Allegiance</HI> and <HI>Supremacy,</HI> and yet were abandon'd by a disloyal <HI>Sophistical</HI> Principle of <HI>the want of Power in a lawful Sovereign to protect them, absolving them from their Obedience,</HI> to cancel their <HI>Oaths</HI> in the Court of Conscience.</P>
<P>And in a word further to shew you how the tender <HI>Regard</HI> of publick Promises was here grown one of <HI>Pancirol's lost things,</HI> I shall tell you, that tho in the Parliament of <HI>Richard Cromwell,</HI> none was allowed to sit but he who had first took a <HI>Recognition</HI> of <HI>engaging to be true and faithful to the Lord Protector,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and not to propose or give any Consent to alter the Go|vernment as 'tis setled in one single Person and a Parliament,</HI> yet the <HI>Repub|licans</HI> in that <HI>Parliament</HI> were not in the least diverted by that <HI>Recognition</HI> from endeavouring there to <HI>alter</HI> the <HI>Government,</HI> and it was there <HI>avowed</HI> by them, that <HI>a Promise or Oath took without Doors, did not bind within.</HI></P>
<P>And at last to bring up the Rear of mens Perjury, after all the <HI>Oaths</HI> legal and illegal had been so much confounded, when the late King's Re|stauration was almost in sight on the then General <HI>Monk</HI> with his <HI>Army</HI> coming to <HI>London,</HI> a new <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Abjuration</HI> of the <HI>Royal</HI> Line was at that time set on foot in Councel, and which some there would have had impo|sed on the <HI>General</HI> himself.</P>

<P><PB N="11" REF="8">Let any one consider, how after the beginning of the <HI>Parliament</HI> of <HI>Forty,</HI> they had obtain'd in the very <HI>Act</HI> that took away the <HI>Ship-money,</HI> that all the <HI>Particulars</HI> prayed or <HI>desired</HI> in the <HI>Petition</HI> of <HI>Right</HI> should be <HI>enacted;</HI> one whereof was, That <HI>no Oath should be imposed on the Subjects that was not establish'd by Act of Parliament,</HI> and how in <HI>despite</HI> of that <HI>Law,</HI> they without any such <HI>Act,</HI> out of a blind <HI>Zeal</HI> for <HI>Religion, imposed</HI> this dread|ful <HI>Oath</HI> on the People: Let any one but read over <HI>The Covenant with a Narrative,</HI> and the <HI>Speeches</HI> of Mr. <HI>Nye</HI> and Mr. <HI>Hendersham</HI> at the time of the Solemn <HI>Reading, Swearing</HI> and <HI>Subscribing</HI> of the <HI>Covenant</HI> by the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Commons,</HI> and <HI>Assembly</HI> of <HI>Divines</HI> in St. <HI>Margaret</HI>'s Church&punc; and observe in Mr. <HI>Nye's Speech,</HI> his Saying, that ASSOCIATION <HI>is of Divine offspring,</HI> and his resembling of this <HI>Covenant to the Covenant of Grace,</HI> and the matter of it there represented by him as <HI>worthy to be sworn by all the Kingdoms of the World, as a giving up of all those Kingdoms to Christ;</HI> and where it followeth, <HI>yea, we find this very thing in the utmost accom|plishment of it, to have been the Oath of the greatest Angel that ever was, who setting his feet on two of Gods Kingdoms, the one upon the Sea, the other upon the Earth, lifting up his hand to Heaven, as you are to do this day, and so Swearing,</HI> Rev. 10. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and consider how he there makes this Oath to be the most effectual means for the ruining <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>Prelacy,</HI> and leaves it to be consider'd, whether, <HI>seeing the preservation of Popery hath been by Leagues and Covenants, God may not make a League and Cove|nant to be its Destruction,</HI> after he had before-mention'd the <HI>Associations of the Religious Orders and Fraternities, and the Combination by the</HI> la Sainte Ligue <HI>for the muniting of Popery,</HI> as incentives to this League; and how he doth again go to the <HI>Magazine</HI> of the <HI>Apocalypse</HI> for some <HI>Weapons</HI> for this <HI>Covenant,</HI> and hath other <HI>artillery</HI> for it from the <HI>Iewish</HI> State, citing the words of the Prophet, <HI>Let us joyn our selves to the Lord in a perpetual Covenant that shall not be forgotten,</HI> &amp; how according to the <HI>ratio nominis</HI> of <HI>Superstition,</HI> viz. of mens over-importunate <HI>Prayers</HI> that their <HI>Children</HI> might out-live them, he concludes with a devout <HI>Prayer,</HI> that this <HI>Cove|nant</HI> may <HI>out-live <HI>their Childrens Children;</HI></HI> and let any one behold in Mr. <HI>Henderson</HI>'s Speech the like flame of <HI>Enthusiastick</HI> Zeal (or of the <HI>Su|perstition <HI>quam vulgo bonam intentionem vocant</HI>) against Superstition</HI> and <HI>Idolatry in Worship,</HI> &amp;c. and concluding it with his belief, that the weight of that <HI>Covenant</HI> would cast the balance in our <HI>English</HI> Wars; I say let any one consider all this, and tell me if ever he saw a more pompous <HI>Scene</HI> of <HI>Superstition,</HI> and more magnificent <HI>Procession</HI> bestow'd on it, and contrived as Bishop <HI>Sanderson</HI>'s words are in his <HI>Lecture, De bon&acirc; intentione</HI> (and ha|ving his <HI>eye</HI> on that <HI>Covenant</HI>) viz. <HI>Obtentu gloriae Dei, reformandae Reli|gionis, propagandi Evangelii, extirpandae superstitionis, exaltandi regni Domini nostri Iesu Christi;</HI> and if ever he saw what the <HI>Bishop</HI> in that <HI>Lecture</HI> calls <HI>The Iesuites Theology,</HI> viz. <HI>Omnia metiri ex Commodo San|ctae matris Ecclesiae,</HI> more strongly asserted then in the <HI>Contexture</HI> and <HI>Imposition</HI> of that <HI>Covenant.</HI></P>

<P>You have great reason to judge so; and if you had read the <HI>Scotch</HI> Statutes since the <HI>year</HI> 1660, you would find the <HI>Body</HI> of that <HI>Nation</HI> having the <HI>temperamentum ad pondus</HI> for <HI>Loyalty.</HI></P>
<P>And your having mention'd the <HI>old Leaven</HI> there purged away, minds me of minding you that that <HI>Nation</HI> having so nobly discharged its moral offices in that <HI>Case,</HI> ought to be <HI>absolv'd</HI> in the thoughts of all the <HI>Loyal</HI> from the <HI>Fact</HI> of its former deflection from Loyalty: and that the great measures of <HI>Christian</HI> Charity ought to extend beyond that Judgment of <HI>Seneca,</HI> that <HI>poenitens est fere innocens,</HI> and even as far as S. <HI>Paul</HI>'s gene|rous <HI>discharge</HI> of the <HI>Corinthians</HI> on their having <HI>purged</HI> out that <HI>fer|ment,</HI> viz. <HI>For behold what carefulness it wrought in you, what clearing of your selves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>In all things ye have approved your selves to be clear in this Matter.</HI> Look on their <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> in the time of K. <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, by one of which it is <HI>declared,</HI> That <HI>his Majesty his Heirs and Successors, by Uirtue of the Royal Power which they hold from God Almighty over this Kingdom, shall have the sole Choice and Appointment of Officers of State, and Councellors and Iudges;</HI> and by another, That the Estates of Parliament considering that <HI>the Kings of this Realm deriving their Power from God Almighty do succeed Li|neally thereunto.</HI> And I can direct you to <HI>another,</HI> that contains in it so strange a <HI>Resignation</HI> to the <HI>King</HI>'s measures, as may make you again won|der at the <HI>possibility</HI> of such a temper, and not to be equall'd by any thing I have read of&punc; but that <HI>pang</HI> of <HI>Zeal</HI> wherewith so many once at <HI>Cam|bridge</HI> were affected for <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>Senior,</HI> when they swore <HI>to will what he willed;</HI> I mean that <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> An. 1661. <HI>Concern|ing the League and Covenant, and discharging the renewing thereof without his Majesties Warrant and Approbation.</HI> The Act concludes with an Inhibition, <HI>That none presume to renew that Covenant or any other League or Covenant without his Majesties special Warrant so to do.</HI> Thus then that <HI>Covenant</HI> tho by them so much <HI>nauseated,</HI> they shew'd themselves ready again to <HI>swallow,</HI> if his <HI>Majesty</HI> for any such reasons of State, as they could not foresee, should enjoyn them so to do.</P>

<P>For I find in a Look call'd <HI>A Compendious History of the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">st remarka|ble Passages of the last</HI> 14 <HI>Years,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>printed An.</HI> 1680. that in p. 205. the Author referring to the Month of <HI>Iuly,</HI> 1677. saith, that <HI>upon a Rebelli|on in that Kingdom being nipt in the Bud, his Majesty was pleas'd to publish a Proclamation, <HI>Commanding the Iudges and all Magistrates to apprehend and punish all such as frequented any Field-Conventi|cles,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>according to the Prescript of the Law, as also to prosecute with all Legal Rigour the execrable Murtherers of the late Arch-Bishop of St.</HI></HI> Andrews: <HI>declaring withal that his Majesty being desirous to reclaim all such as had been mis-lead through Ignorance or blind zeal, had according to the Power reserved to his Majesty by the 5th Act in the 2d Session of the 2d Parliament, suspended the execution of all Laws and Acts against such as frequent house-Conventicles on the south|side of the River</HI> Tay, <HI>excepting the Town of</HI> Edenburgh, <HI>and two Miles round the same,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And the truth is, it must likewise be to the <HI>honour</HI> of that <HI>Nation</HI> ac|knowledged that in the <HI>worst</HI> of Times, they after their <HI>Covenant</HI> did not Contract any such guilt of <HI>Perjury</HI> by a <HI>superfetation</HI> of <HI>enterfering</HI> Oaths, as great <HI>Numbers</HI> of our <HI>Land</HI> did: and that they were <HI>exemplary</HI> to <HI>Eng|land</HI> in <HI>Loyalty,</HI> and in propping up the <HI>hereditary</HI> Monarchy, while so many here in the <HI>Plott-Conjuncture</HI> were infatuated with the <HI>Project</HI> of the <HI>EXCLUSION,</HI> as to give me occasion by a <HI>fresher</HI> instance, and but of <HI>yesterdays</HI> occurrence to invite you to behold a <HI>Spectacle</HI> of the divine <HI>Iu|stice</HI> in abandoning such Men here to the guilt of <HI>Superstition</HI> who used un|just means to <HI>extirpate it.</HI></P>
<P>Such among us who had not took notice of that <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Scotch SAINTE LIGUE,</HI> and its being so generally exploded, and who in the late <HI>Ferment</HI> about <HI>Popery</HI> would have fortify'd an <HI>Exclusion</HI> with an <HI>Asso|ciation;</HI>

<P>I am sure the Spectacle of mangled and slaughter'd Bodies covering a Field immediately after a Battle hath not more horror in it, then the sight of the Consciences mai'md and wounded by the inobservance of <HI>publick</HI> Oaths hath been since the <HI>Aera</HI> of 41.</P>
<P>And as our <HI>Chronicles</HI> mention, that <HI>they who were born in</HI> England <HI>the Year after the great Mortality An.</HI> 1349. <HI>wanted some of their cheek Teeth,</HI> I may say that generally they who have been born here the <HI>Years</HI> after 41. wherein the <HI>Plague</HI> of <HI>Perjury</HI> by the outraging those <HI>Oaths</HI> of <HI>Allegiance</HI> and <HI>Supremacy</HI> was so <HI>epidemical,</HI> have seem'd able only to <HI>swal|low</HI> those Oaths, but not to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">hew</HI> upon them in serious and considerate thoughts: no not at the very frequent times of their <HI>taking them.</HI></P>

<P>I think that many who by repentance have been cured of the <HI>Epi|demical</HI> Plague of <HI>Perjury</HI> that reged here in 41. and of such a <HI>Plague,</HI> and another of <HI>Fears</HI> and <HI>Iealousies</HI> since 81, have yet sustain'd more dam|age thereby, then they who were born the <HI>Year</HI> after 1349 did in want|ing some of their <HI>Cheek Teeth;</HI> and that their case is like that of those who were recover'd of the great <HI>Plague</HI> at <HI>Athens</HI> that <HI>Thucydides</HI> hath de|scribed, and who tells us, that after their <HI>recovery,</HI> their <HI>Souls</HI> had lost the faculty of <HI>Memory,</HI> and were <HI>dozed</HI> with an <GAP DESC="foreign"> about what themselves had done, or what had passed in the World during the horror of that very <HI>Plague,</HI> or before or since.

<P>By no means. I have more Humanity and Christian Charity then to do so. I shall here observe to you that <HI>Divines</HI> in their measures of Mens sinful Actions do often make use of the <HI>distinction</HI> of <HI>materialiter</HI> and <HI>formaliter.</HI> Thus for example, <HI>Ames</HI> in his <HI>Cases</HI> of <HI>Conscience</HI> l. 5. c. 53. <HI>Si quis falsum dicit, putans esse verum, mentitur tantum materialiter. Si quis verum dicit, putans esse falsum, mentitur formaliter.</HI> And he hav|ing

<P>And it is therefore no wonder that such their Judgment of Charity hath been retaliated by some of the most Renowned <HI>Divines</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> viz. the <HI>Lord Primate</HI> Bramhal, <HI>Bishop</HI> Taylor, <HI>Dr.</HI> Hammond and others, who have deny'd to pronounce the <HI>worshipping</HI> the <HI>Host</HI> to be <HI>formal</HI> Idolatry; that is to say, to be not so at all in reality, since we know that according to the <HI>trite</HI> Rule, <HI>forma dat esse.</HI></P>
<P>And thus that <HI>Primate</HI> in his <HI>Schism Guarded</HI> saith very well for that purpose, <HI>p.</HI> 57. <HI>Every one who is involved</HI> materially <HI>in a Schism is not a</HI> for|mal <HI>Schismatick, more then she that Marries after long expectation, believing and having reason to believe that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">r former Husband was dead is</HI> a formal <HI>Adulteress, or then he who is drawn to give Divine Worship to a Creature by some misapprehension, yet addressing his Devotions to the true God, is</HI> a for|mal <HI>Idolater.</HI> And having there cited S. <HI>Austin</HI> of <HI>Heresy, He who did not run into his error out of his own over-weening Presumption&punc; nor defends it per|tinaciously, but receiv'd it from his seduced Parents, and is careful to search out the truth, and ready to be Corrected if he find it cut, he is not to be repu|ted among Hereticks;</HI> he saith, <HI>it is much more true of Schism, that he who is involv'd in Schism through the error of his Parents or Predecessors, who carefully seeketh after truth, and is prepared in his mind to embrace it when|soever he finds it, he is not to be reputed a Schismatick.</HI></P>
<P>I know <HI>Azorius</HI> de <HI>Iuramento</HI> gives his Judgment well <HI>in thesi, That when a Law is changed to which a man is bound by Oath, tho he is thereby</HI> materially <HI>discharged, yet</HI> formally <HI>he is bound in respect of his will: for if ever he actually assents to the alteration, he is really perjured.</HI> And so leaving it to such who were Men of great <HI>Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Consideration,</HI> and had <HI>took</HI> the <HI>Oaths,</HI> and were ready to <HI>promo'e</HI> a new <HI>Law</HI> for altering the hereditary Monarchy; to think of the danger they incurred of the for|mal guilt of that Crime, I have more Charity then to conclude all the rash, and the incogitant, and the weak, and the seduced by the fantastick <HI>Interpretation</HI> of the <HI>Oath,</HI> to have been perjured.</P>
<P>But as about the <HI>year</HI> 1164. <HI>Thomas</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> was at a <HI>Council</HI> held at <HI>Northampton</HI> accused by the King of <HI>Perjury,</HI> and <HI>Condemned as guilty of it, because he had not observ'd those English Customs that he was sworn to</HI> (as I find <HI>Francisc. Long. de Concil.</HI> p. 806. <HI>Col.</HI> 1. cited for it) so if you have taken the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Supremacy,</HI> and Sworn <HI>to defend all the Pri|vileges and Preheminences granted or belonging to the King, his Heirs and Successors, and united to the Imperial Crown of this Realm,</HI> and are of opinion that <HI>one</HI> of the <HI>Privileges</HI> of those <HI>Heirs</HI> and <HI>Successors</HI> is to <HI>succ&eacute;ed</HI> to that Crown as it comes to their turn according to <HI>Proximity</HI> of <HI>Blood,</HI> and by their inherent <HI>Birth-right,</HI> and as the <HI>Hereditary</HI> Succession <HI>ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e Coronae</HI> is <HI>setled</HI> by the Common <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> I shall tell you that the Pious and profound<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ly Learned <HI>Divine</HI> Dr. <HI>Hicks,</HI> who hath <HI>study'd</HI> this <HI>Point</HI> as much as any man, hath in his Writings told you that having

<HI>taken</HI> this <HI>Oath,</HI> you could not honestly <HI>consent</HI> to a <HI>Bill</HI> of <HI>Exclusion, which would have deprived the next Heir (and in him virtually the whole royal Fa|mily)</HI> of <HI>the chief Privilege and Preheminence that belong'd to him by the Common Law of this Realm,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Your Curiosity (I believe) hath led you to read over his learned <HI>Io|vian,</HI> and to observe what he there saith in his Preface, that <HI>some Men did pervert the meaning of the word <HI>Heirs</HI> in the <HI>Oaths of Allegiance and Su|premacy,</HI> from its common and usual acceptation to another more special, on purpose to elude the force and <HI>Obligation</HI> which otherwise they must have had on <HI>the Consciences</HI> of the <HI>Excluders themselves.</HI></HI></P>
<P>But it is not only the <HI>Authority</HI> of this single great <HI>Divine</HI> that I can lay before your thoughts for the rendring the <HI>Attempt</HI> of the <HI>Exclusion</HI> con|trary to our Oath: but I can direct you to the censure of the <HI>three Estates</HI> of a Loyal <HI>Nation,</HI> and of His late <HI>Maj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">sty</HI> in the case. For the <HI>Oaths</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> binding the takers both to the King and his Heirs and Successors as ours do here, I can tell you that in the Third <HI>Parliament</HI> of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, <HI>Aug.</HI> 13. 1681. you will find the <HI>Act</HI> in these <HI>words,</HI> viz. <HI>The Estates of Parliament considering that the Kings of this Realm deriving their Royal Power from God Almighty alone, do succeed lineally thereto, according to the known degrees of Proximity in Blood, which cannot be interrupted, suspended, or diverted by any Act or Statute whatsoever, and that none can attempt to alter or divert the said Succession without involving the Subjects of this Kingdom in Perjury and Rebellion,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I know that during the late <HI>turbid interval</HI> of the Nation, some <HI>Loyal</HI> men of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> were so much <HI>misguided,</HI> as to think that be|cause <HI>de facto</HI> Parliaments <HI>have heretofore directed and limited the succes|sion of the Crown in other manner, then in course it would otherwise have gone</HI> (as the <HI>words</HI> in the Printed <HI>Exclusion-Bill</HI> were) they might therefore of <HI>right</HI> do so again; <HI>notwithstanding</HI> they <HI>knew</HI> that after the <HI>Parliament</HI> of King <HI>Iames</HI> to prevent the Right of <HI>Succession</HI> from <HI>fluctuating</HI> any more, had justly recognized and declared, That <HI>the Imperial Crown of this Realm,</HI> and <HI>Rights belonging to the same, did by inherent Birth-right and lawful and undoubted Succession descend and come to him, as being line|ally, justly and lawfully next and sole Heir of the Blood Royal of this Realm,</HI> it did afterward by a New <HI>Oath of Obedience</HI> or <HI>Allegiance,</HI> oblige mens <HI>Consciences</HI> both to the <HI>Crown</HI> and the <HI>hereditary</HI> lineal Succession, and <HI>notwithstanding</HI> they <HI>knew</HI> that that <HI>Parliament</HI> had took care of con|tinuing the Obligation of the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Supremacy</HI> for the <HI>bearing Faith and true Allegiance to the King, his Heirs and lawful Successors, and to assist and defend all Privileges, and Preheminences and Authorities granted or belonging to the King, his Heirs and Successors,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But I doubt not but the <HI>Consciences</HI> of the <HI>Considerate</HI> Loyal, now ex|postulating with them in the <HI>cool</HI> of the <HI>day,</HI> whether they did then <HI>well</HI> in being <HI>angry</HI> with the <HI>Imposers</HI> sense of their <HI>Oaths,</HI> and in not penetrating into the Obligations thereby incurred; and particularly in not weighing whether such who had taken those Oaths, and yet by <HI>Projects</HI> and <HI>Expe|dients</HI> would have <HI>banish'd</HI> the Heir even after he should come to be Actual Successor from the effects of their Sworn Allegiance, and of their Sworn <HI>Assistance</HI> and <HI>Defence</HI> of <HI>all Privileges and Preheminences and Authorities granted, or belonging,</HI> &amp;c. had not visibly out-ran their Oaths, they will recollect the late dreadful want of tenderness for the observance of the same.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="12">It will be hard for many men on a serious Self-examination to reflect otherwise on themselves, after that Sir <HI>W.

<P>I thank you for thus gently leading me by the hand to such a height of Noble thoughts relating to that <HI>Oath,</HI> as from whence I am able to look back with grief on my past aberrations through inadvertence, from what my Oath <HI>obliged</HI> me to in relation to the Support of the <HI>hereditary</HI> Mo|narchy (and concerning which <HI>Obligation,</HI> the <HI>Casuistical Discussion</HI> you sent me did sufficiently illuminate me) and to take a prospect into my duty that lies before me to <HI>assist and defend to my Power all Iurisdictions, Privi|leges,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>granted or belonging to the King's Highness,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>or united and an|nex'd to the Imperial Crown of this Realm.</HI></P>
<P>I am sensible that as some vain Swearers in common Discourse, will upon their being occasionally reproved for it, be apt to swear that they did not
<PB N="20" REF="13">
swear, and that as there are <HI>Fools</HI> that say in their Souls that <HI>there is no God,</HI> and that <HI>there</HI> is <HI>no Soul;</HI> so there is a sort of careless men who having taken this great <HI>Promissory</HI> Oath, will yet by their Actions deny their having sworn to assist and defend some of those Privileges, and likewise be apt to <HI>say</HI> in their <HI>hearts</HI> they have not <HI>invoked</HI> God as <HI>Witness</HI> and <HI>Revenger</HI> in the case of that Oath, and that they are not absolutely bound by it, or but only by their reserved sense; or as if a man representing his Country, he were only to take a kind of formal Oath <HI>in animam Domini,</HI> and not to venture his own Soul.</P>
<P>But for my part, I account it as <HI>vile</HI> to be <HI>perjured</HI> in a solemn <HI>Promis|sory</HI> Oath as in a judicial <HI>Assertory</HI> one; and shall hereafter think my self as much bound to use all exactness and tenderness in the recollection o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> my thoughts after a <HI>Promissory</HI> Oath, as every Man of Honour doth before an <HI>assertory</HI> Oath when he is a witness in a <HI>Court</HI> of Law. And I think that it is only the <HI>multitudo peccantium</HI> about solemn <HI>promissroy</HI> Oaths, as for example, about the promised <HI>assistance</HI> and <HI>defence</HI> of the <HI>Privileges</HI> of the Crown in the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Supremacy,</HI> that diminisheth the Shame and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">gnominy of mens being either through corrupt affections or incogitancy (and the <HI>crassa negligentia</HI> which the Law makes to be <HI>dolus malus) Vacillant</HI> or <HI>Con|tradictory</HI> in the <HI>Series</HI> of their <HI>actings</HI> promised, or through <HI>lachesse</HI> or subdolcus pretences withholding their performance of part of what they obliged themselves to do; and that keeps the <HI>populace</HI> from a <HI>nauseous</HI> look|ing on them as <HI>falsarii,</HI> and as much as on Witnesses produced in Courts, who in the things asserted by their Testimony are for want of precaution of thought, <HI>varii &amp; vacillantes</HI> and contradictory to themselves, and ming|lers of Falshood with truth, and who conceal part of the whole truth they were to depose.</P>

<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is another thing that makes the <HI>Moral</HI> offices required in an Oath <HI>Promissory</HI> call for some kind of Consideration, that an Oath <HI>Asser|tory</HI> doth not: for we are not to depose o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> <HI>Matter</HI> of <HI>Law,</HI> but only of <HI>Fact:</HI> but in the Promissory parts of the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance our thoughts are obliged to have regard to Matters of <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Law. We are to our Power to assist and defend all Privileges and Preheminences GRANTED or BELONGING to the King,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and which ARE united to the Imperial Crown of this Realm.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>But by this means, while you would have men keep up the <HI>ease</HI> of their <HI>Consciences</HI> by such <HI>assistance</HI> and <HI>defence,</HI> will not they be put to it to make their lives <HI>uneasy,</HI> by buying <HI>Law-Books,</HI> and being <HI>Students</HI> of the <HI>Crown-Law,</HI> and of the <HI>extent</HI> of the <HI>Regal</HI> rights; a thing never inten|ded by the Makers of the Laws for those Oaths, and whereby such who are to <HI>assist</HI> and <HI>defend</HI> and <HI>Rights</HI> of the Crown by Action in Land or Sea|Service would be hinder'd therein by Speculation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>No man need amuse himself about any such matter. Nor are our Princes, who by their <HI>Coronation</HI> Oaths oblige themselves to defend all our rightful Laws and Customs, bound thereby to study the <HI>Report-Books</HI> of the Law concerning the Rights and Properties of their Subjects, and whereby the time of Princes would be taken up from defending them. And I shall tell you, that tho all men are morally bound to frame the best Conceptions, and make the truest representations of the Divine Nature they can, and which by the measures of the <HI>Scripture</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s comprehended under our Duty of <HI>glorifying</HI> God; yet not to study the Controversies be|tween the <HI>Remonstrants</HI> and <HI>Contra-Remonstrants</HI> about the absoluteness of the Divine Decrees, and Dominion, or whether God according to his abso|lute Dominion can torment an innocent Creature.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="13">And thus tho we are bound to honour God's Vice gerents, and to <HI>assist</HI> and <HI>defend</HI> their <HI>Rights, Privileges,</HI> and <HI>Preheminences</HI> we are not to con|sume our whole lives in the investigation of Truth in the <HI>Moot-Points</HI> about the same.</P>
<P>But as to this thing, that great <HI>Casuist</HI> of the Age, Bishop <HI>Sanderson,</HI> may help to set us right in his Third <HI>Lecture</HI> of <HI>Oaths,</HI> Sect. 17&punc; where putting the <HI>Case</HI> when Subjects are required to take an <HI>Oath for Preservation and Defence of Laws and Liberties, Privileges, Prerogatives and Preheminences of some Superior Power, as of a King, a Common-wealth, or Lord Paramount, such as are among us, the Oaths of H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">mage, of Royal Supremacy,</HI> &amp;c. he saith, <HI>No man denies these Oaths to be lawful or obligatory: but in respect of the frequent incertainty of the Laws whereunto they relate, it may very well be do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">bted how far they oblige. Doubtless the Subject to his Power is obliged to defend all Rights which appear either by Law or Custom Legitimate, whe|ther defined by the written Law, or in force through long use of time, or prescription, that is, so far as they are known, or may morally be known. But he is not equally obliged to the observation of all those which are Controverted or doubtful, especially since Powerful men are accustomed to stretch their ted|ders, and leap over the Land-marks of their Neighbours, not contenting them|selves within the bounds of their own Right. Nevertheless a Subject ought always to be prepared in Mind so soon as the justness of those things which are doubtful shall appear, to a knowledge and defend them.</HI></P>
<P>It may be hence rationally deduced that such who are call'd to the <HI>Helm</HI> of <HI>State,</HI> or are <HI>Members</HI> of <HI>Parliament,</HI> if any Matters relating to any <HI>Iurisdictions, Privileges,</HI> and <HI>Authorities</HI> granted or <HI>belonging</HI> to the Crown shall come in question before them, are by <HI>virtue</HI> of the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Supremacy</HI> bound to endeavour to know whether those Jurisdictions, Privi|leges, and Authorities are <HI>granted,</HI> or <HI>do</HI> belong to the Crown, that is, <HI>so far as they are known or may morally be known</HI> before they refuse to <HI>de|fend</HI> and <HI>assist</HI> them: and much more before they shall do any act of offend|ing or resisting the same, and before they shall entertain any hard thoughts of their Prince for claiming this or that Privilege. And where the <HI>right</HI> of any <HI>Iurisdictions, Privileges granted</HI> or <HI>belonging</HI> to the <HI>Crown</HI> is not <HI>Con|troverted</HI> or <HI>doubtful,</HI> that <HI>Oath</HI> binds them immediately to <HI>assist</HI> and <HI>defend</HI> the same, and not so much as to move any thing against them, except in some such case as I shall presently mention.</P>

<P>Yes, the long Parliament of 40 did so.

<P>No doubt such men <HI>intended</HI> to entrench on the King's <HI>Privileges</HI> and <HI>Preheminences,</HI> and they <HI>intended</HI> to <HI>violate</HI> their <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Supremacy.</HI></P>

<P>Many more then I have now time to name; but cannot forget the fatal Consequences of their outraging one of those uncontroverted Rights which was at the King's Pleasure to Prorogue or Dissolve Parliaments, by putting such <HI>incessant</HI> hardships on that <HI>Pious</HI> King to engage him to pass the <HI>Act</HI> that that Parliament should continue till both the Houses did con|sent

<P>I shall here by the way ask you if you did not once tell me that the most profound Observers of the Affairs in <HI>Ireland;</HI> had agreed in it as their firm Judgment, that the <HI>Irish</HI> Rebellion had never happen'd if the <HI>Parliament</HI> of 40 here had not meddled in the Case of the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Strafford,</HI> and occasion'd his removal from being chief Governour of <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>

<P>I shall by the way answer you, that I did tell you so, and that they judged that the <HI>Character</HI> of that Earl's great Wisdom and Courage, and Activity, and of universality in his Correspondencies, had gain'd such an <HI>Ascendant</HI> over the <HI>Genius</HI> of the <HI>Irish,</HI> that if he had continued Lord Lieutenant of that Kingdom in his former Power, they would not have ven|tured to rebel.</P>

<P>You have <HI>instanced</HI> in <HI>Uncontroverted</HI> Privileges of the Crown that that Parliament did offend and resist, by their putting such <HI>incessant hard|ships on their King,</HI> as your words are; and it was folly as well as breach of their Oath for them thus to strike at the <HI>Pardoning</HI> Power of the Crown that is the <HI>Privilege</HI> both of King and People. Yet let me ask you whe|ther you account that he who in any case shall endeavour that by the Le|gislative Power any <HI>uncontroverted Iurisdiction, Privilege, Preheminence, or Authority granted or belonging to the Crown</HI> may be alter'd or restrain'd in its exercise, breaks his <HI>Oath?</HI> Did that <HI>Parliament</HI> do so who made the famous <HI>Act</HI> for <HI>barring</HI> the known <HI>Privilege</HI> of <HI>Nullum tempus Occurrit Regi,</HI> I mean, that glorious <HI>Act</HI> of 21^o of King <HI>Iames</HI> the First, <HI>C.</HI> 2. of which the <HI>Title</HI> is, <HI>Conceald Lands shall not be Recover'd, unless it may be proved that the King had title to them within 60 years;</HI> i. e. 60 <HI>years</HI> before the <HI>19th</HI> of <HI>February</HI> in the <HI>21st</HI> year of King <HI>Iames</HI> the First, which was the day of the beginning of that <HI>Parliament,</HI> and on which <HI>Statute</HI> my Lord <HI>Coke</HI> hath an excellent <HI>Comment</HI> in <HI>Instit.</HI> 3. C. 87. <HI>against Concealors (turbidum genus hominum</HI>) and all pretences of <HI>Concealments</HI> whatsoever; and on occasion of which <HI>Act</HI> it is yet acknowledg'd in the Book call'd, <HI>The Court and Character of King</HI> James, <HI>written by Sir</HI> A.

<P>Having <HI>premised</HI> it to you that those words in the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>assisting</HI> and <HI>defending ALL Iurisdictions, ALL Privileges,</HI> &amp;c. are <HI>operative</HI> words, and of <HI>strict</HI> Interpretation, and whereby we <HI>stake</HI> our <HI>Eternities</HI> to assist the King's <HI>Temporal</HI> Rights, and <HI>invoke</HI> God so to <HI>help</HI> or <HI>assist</HI> us as <HI>we</HI> shall <HI>assist all those Privileges,</HI> and that the Prince and the <HI>Church</HI> being look'd on as <HI>Minors,</HI> the <HI>breach</HI> of an <HI>Oath</HI> to <HI>defend</HI> the <HI>Privileges</HI> of the <HI>King</HI> must appear to common sense as odious as if any Guardian of a <HI>Minor</HI> did break an Oath to defend his Person and Interest, or did take part with any to destroy the <HI>Minor</HI>'s Rights; I shall yet be so fair as to tell you that I do not so account it: <HI>provided</HI> that he who shall do so shall have a moral certainty that the Prince being sensible that the <HI>alteration</HI> or restraint of such <HI>Privilege</HI> will be very beneficial to the Subjects both in the present and future times, and necessary to the enabling them the better to support the Crown, hath signified his desire of the same, and doth so desire it: or if he knoweth not his Princes so desiring it, believes that the <HI>Cogency</HI> of the Rea|sons he hath humbly to offer for such <HI>alteration</HI> being made, is such as may Incline others to <HI>supplicate</HI> the <HI>Prince</HI> to consent to it, and the Prince so to do.</P>
<P>Yet in this latter case, if afterward the Sovereign notifies his desire of the continuance of such known <HI>Privilege,</HI> I am then by my <HI>Oath</HI> to <HI>assist</HI> and <HI>defend</HI> the same, and am not to the <HI>Cogency</HI> of my <HI>Reasons</HI> to add that of <HI>Importunity.</HI> For there is a <HI>par</HI> or <HI>proportion</HI> between <HI>importunity</HI> and <HI>force;</HI> whence we see that according to the <HI>King's</HI> Ecclesiastical Laws, in case of a former will, a latter gain'd by <HI>importunoe preces</HI> in the time of the Testator's Sickness, is often adjudged void. And as I am not by <HI>impor|tunity</HI> when my Princes Affairs are in a <HI>Sickly</HI> state, or that the Die of <HI>War</HI> hath ran against him abroad&punc; to press and tire him then into a parting with his known <HI>Privileges,</HI> so neither with a <HI>Salvo</HI> to my Oath, which binds me to <HI>assist</HI> and <HI>defend</HI> them, can I if I find his Judgment or Mind sickly, lay Temptations before him to buy him as it were out of a <HI>Privilege</HI> that is just and adviseable for him to keep&punc; I am neither to <HI>starve</HI> nor <HI>pamper</HI> my Prince out of such a Privilege. Nay more, if my Prince did by any Error part with any such <HI>Privilege,</HI> as not knowing the same to be <HI>inhe|rent</HI> in the Crown (as in the <HI>Case</HI> of an Answer of the Royal <HI>Martyr</HI> drawn by one of his Ministers not deeply vers'd in the Law, to some of the Parliaments <HI>Propositions,</HI> by which Answer he is acknowledg'd to be <HI>one</HI> of the <HI>three</HI> Estates) I, who know that the <HI>Privilege</HI> and <HI>Preheminence</HI> inhe|rent in his Crown is to be <HI>above</HI> them all, and have in the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Supre|macy</HI> Sworn that the King <HI>is the only Supream Governour,</HI> and so none <HI>Co-ordinate,</HI> or <HI>equal</HI> to him, I am to take no advantage of that <HI>error,</HI> but am still to <HI>assist</HI> and <HI>defend</HI> such his <HI>Preheminence.</HI></P>
<P>And if ever a Prince did by <HI>fear</HI> part with such <HI>Privilege</HI> or <HI>Preheminence,</HI> there being a <HI>par</HI> between <HI>fear</HI> and <HI>force,</HI> according to that Law of the <HI>Proetor</HI> in the <HI>Digests, Quod vi aut metu factum est ratum non habebo</HI> (and in which <HI>Law,</HI> as <HI>Baldus</HI> saith, the <HI>Proetor</HI> was <HI>inspired</HI> by the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God) I am not only not to take any advantage of such act of the <HI>Prince</HI> done by <HI>fear</HI> or <HI>force,</HI> or to upbraid him therewith, but am still to <HI>assist</HI> and <HI>defend</HI> such <HI>Privilege</HI> so derelinquish'd by him, and am to account the same <HI>belonging</HI> to him as the word is in my <HI>Promissory</HI> Oath, and to account him still in Law <HI>possess'd</HI> of the same, according to the rule of <HI>Possessio etiam animo retinetur:</HI> and which is justly apply'd in the Case of any one who in a <HI>Storm</HI> at <HI>Sea</HI> throws his Goods over-board to lighten the Ship.</P>
<P>His late Majesty therefore did but right to himself, when in his <HI>Declara|tion</HI> of the 25th of <HI>October,</HI> 1660. <HI>Concerning Ecclesiastical Affairs,</HI> he took
<PB N="24" REF="15">
notice <HI>how some had caused to be Printed and Publish'd in</HI> England <HI>a Decla|ration before Printed in his Name when he was in</HI> Scotland, (<HI>i. e.</HI> referring to the <HI>Declaration</HI> Printed at <HI>Edenburgh,</HI> 1650.) and saith thus of it, <HI>viz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> Of which we shall say no more, then that the Circumstances by which we were enforced to sign that Declaration, are enough known to the World: And that the worthiest and greatest part of that Nation did even then detest and abhor the ill usage of us in that particular when the same tyranny was exercised there by the Power of a few ill men, which at that time had spread it self over this Kingdom, and therefore we had no reason to expect that we should at this season when we are doing all we can to wipe cut the memor&punc; of all that hath been done amiss by other men, and we thank God have wiped it out of our own Remembrance, have been our self assaulted with those rep oaches, which we will likewise forget.</HI></P>
<P>And it was <HI>goodness</HI> worthy the great Soul of a <HI>King</HI> to forget the <HI>Out|rages</HI> of such who did <HI>strip</HI> their <HI>Political</HI> Father of his Power, and then <HI>reproach</HI> him with his <HI>nakedness.</HI></P>
<P>I may here likewise tell you (and not <HI>mal a propos</HI>) how much the patience and long-suffering of the same Prince was exercised in a late <HI>Conjuncture</HI> that so much eclipsed his <HI>Prerogative</HI> in the Case of the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Danby</HI>'s Par|don, and when the Commons did set up against it somewhat in his Father's Answer to the 19 <HI>Propositions</HI> before mention'd, that nothing but the <HI>tempest</HI> of the Age in the <HI>Parliament</HI> of 40 could have occasion'd, viz. <HI>Since there|fore the Power legally placed in both Houses of Parliament is more then suffi|cient to restrain the Power of Tyranny,</HI> &amp;c. But because a Parliament so <HI>perpetuated</HI> as that was, did prove more then sufficient to restrain pretended Tyranny, and real just Government, will a considerate man say any such thing now, when the <HI>breath</HI> of <HI>Prerogative</HI> can dissolve them in a <HI>moment,</HI> and in that moment <HI>all their thoughts perish,</HI> and all the high-flying <HI>thoughts</HI> that would <HI>soare</HI> above Imperial Power be found <HI>dead</HI> in the Nest?</P>
<P>And I may here tell you, that in the <HI>Answer</HI> of some Nonconformists to Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet</HI>'s Sermon (an <HI>Answer</HI> Printed in <HI>London</HI> in the <HI>year</HI> 1680. during the <HI>ferment</HI> about the <HI>Plot,</HI> and wherein they desire <HI>Indulgence</HI>) I think their attacquing the <HI>Service</HI> on the <HI>Gun-Powder Treason</HI> Plot, in thanking God <HI>for Preserving the King and the Three Estates of the Realm assembled,</HI> by saying, That <HI>the late King made no scruple in his Answer to the</HI> 19 <HI>Propositions to reckon himself one of the three Estates,</HI> was a thing that on recollection they will judge ought not to have been done.</P>
<P>But I am here further to tell you, that though it may be consistent with our <HI>Oath</HI> in some such case as was mention'd, to endeavour the altering by the Legislative Power some <HI>uncontroverted</HI> Privileges of the Crown, and in such a <HI>way</HI> as I have mention'd, I likewise wish you in your thoughts to make a <HI>distinction</HI> of those <HI>Privileges</HI> or <HI>Preheminences</HI> belonging to the <HI>Crown,</HI> that are absolutely <HI>Essential</HI> to its <HI>Preservation,</HI> and to that of the whole Realm, and which are by <HI>God</HI> and the Law put as a <HI>Depositum</HI> into the hands of <HI>Kings,</HI> and the removing of one of which would have the effect of taking a Stone out of an <HI>Arched</HI> Building, and such as no Sove|reign Princes can be without; and such as our <HI>Princes</HI> have in their flou|rishing Reigns to the great content and happiness of their People always exercised, and Rights (as the late Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> said of that of the <HI>Flagg</HI>) that our <HI>Princes cannot part with:</HI> and Privileges that are not such: and two of which former sort of Privileges, and which are parts of the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, I account we are <HI>expresly</HI> in the Pro|missory Clause of that Oath Sworn to <HI>defend,</HI> and assist, namely of the

<P>That <HI>Statute</HI> doth give you a <HI>Prospect</HI> of great variety and use in order to the Settlement of your thoughts about some things in your <HI>Oath.</HI> You there see the Natural recourse of the Royal <HI>Rivers</HI> of Prerogative to the <HI>Oce|an</HI> from whence they came; and when you there find that the <HI>Crown</HI> could communicate to Subjects the exercise of the Prerogative of <HI>Pardoning</HI> Murder, however restrain'd by <HI>ACT</HI> of <HI>Parliament,</HI> and all the dreadful <HI>Disabilities</HI> incurr'd by <HI>Out-laries</HI> for <HI>Felony</HI> and <HI>Treason,</HI> you are not to <HI>wonder</HI> at any ones telling you, that the <HI>King</HI> himself hath the <HI>Privilege</HI> of <HI>Pardoning</HI> a <HI>Disability</HI> incurr'd by Law for <HI>Heterodoxy</HI> in Religion: and especially when you shall see the whole and sole Power of Pardoning the same <HI>united</HI> and <HI>knit</HI> to the <HI>Imperial</HI> Crown of this <HI>Realm,</HI> as of <HI>GOOD RIGHT</HI> and <HI>EQUITT appertaineth.</HI> And according to those words in your <HI>Oath</HI> about your <HI>defending</HI> all the <HI>Rights</HI> and <HI>Privileges united</HI> and <HI>annex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">d to the Imperial Crown of this Realm,</HI> you are to <HI>defend</HI> that great Royal Power of Pardoning, and which our Ancestors in <HI>Harry</HI> the 8th's time thought so essential to Publick Justice.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="16">And therefore you will still do well to remember that your sworn <HI>defence</HI> and <HI>assistance</HI> of <HI>all</HI> the <HI>Privileges</HI> and <HI>Preheminences</HI> of the Crown doth more particularly bind you in the Case of these <HI>fundamental</HI> ones to put no <HI>hardship</HI> on our <HI>Princes,</HI> nor yet to use any softness of <HI>Allurements</HI> to tempt them to renounce them.

<P>Alas; as for several <HI>uncontroverted</HI> Rights of the Crown of an <HI>inferiour</HI> Nature, as our Princes have been ready enough in all Ages to part with them for the good of their People, and their own promoted thereby, and have had grateful returns from their Parliaments by <HI>Subsidies</HI> on such an account, so none need fear but that in all future times succeeding Monarchs will that way be as indulgent as the former ones were; and that as <HI>Solomon</HI> saith, <HI>the King himself is served by the Field,</HI> and the <HI>Plough</HI> having here variously supported the <HI>Throne,</HI> and particularly by the robust <HI>Infantry</HI> it hath yielded to serve the Crown in Arms; the <HI>keeping up</HI> of the <HI>Spirits</HI> of our <HI>Yeomen</HI> (and likewise of those who <HI>Plough'd</HI> the <HI>Sea</HI>) by the <HI>Liberty</HI> our Laws allow'd them, and the <HI>Crowns</HI> being no <HI>gravamen</HI> to the Body of the People, and only to the Royal Heads that wore it, was and will be always necessary in order to the <HI>keeping up</HI> the <HI>being</HI> of the <HI>Nation.</HI></P>
<P>There is therefore <HI>scope</HI> and encouragement enough in <HI>England</HI> for a man who is a <HI>Candidate</HI> for a <HI>Patriot</HI>'s place, to carry it by being a Con|sessor of <HI>unmercenary</HI> Loyalty, and arriving at honour, or the <HI>consentiens laus bonorum</HI> by being a Loyal Patriot: and there is as good popular <HI>air</HI> for any one to feed on who will assert the just Liberties and <HI>Privileges</HI> of the <HI>English</HI> Subjects as any <HI>Greece</HI> or <HI>Rome</HI> afforded: and there was no need for any one to move for a <HI>Statue</HI> for the <HI>Hero</HI> who promoted that old <HI>act</HI> against old <HI>Concealments</HI> in King <HI>Iames</HI> the First's time, or the <HI>late</HI> one for the <HI>Habeas Corpus;</HI> for such an one must find his <HI>Monument</HI> in the <HI>Hearts</HI> of all the Subjects of <HI>England.</HI> Nor was there ever <HI>Prince</HI> more Cordially and Passionately concern'd for the <HI>Liberties</HI> of the People of <HI>England</HI> then the <HI>Royal</HI> Martyr: and who fell <HI>rever&acirc;</HI> as their Martyr according to his <HI>words</HI> on the <HI>Scaffold,</HI> and where he said, <HI>If I would have given way to an Arbitrary Power, to have all Laws changed according to the Power of the Sword, I needed not to have come here.</HI></P>

<P>And tho I know we live in <HI>a crooked and perverse Generation,</HI> wherein so many are at the same time decrying both <HI>summum jus</HI> and Persecution, and too all relaxation of the Laws; and their <HI>Spirits</HI> lie like that <HI>Haven,</HI> Acts 27. 12. <HI>toward the Southwest and Northwest,</HI> two <HI>opposite</HI> Points, (and one would scarce think it possible that mens Spirits could be so extremely <HI>wind|ing</HI> and <HI>crooked,</HI> and thus <HI>opposite</HI> to themselves) and while too they are crying out that any lawful <HI>Dispensing with the Laws establish'd,</HI> is <HI>Contradictio in adjecto:</HI> yet that <HI>Lord Chief Iustice's Report</HI> hath shew'd me the <HI>legality</HI> of the <HI>Dispensative</HI> Power in many particulars, so far as to excite in me a desire to know more of it, and to move me to <HI>pity</HI> the ignorance of my <HI>Countrymen,</HI> who thus cry out of <HI>Contradictio in adjecto,</HI> and not knowing what a <HI>Dispensation</HI> in <HI>Law</HI> means, will fall under that <HI>censure</HI> of the <HI>Monk,</HI> viz. <HI>Corrigis magnific<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">t &amp; nescis quid Significat,</HI> and of that <HI>Adage</HI> in <HI>Eras|mus, Stultior Choraebo,</HI> who not being able to <HI>reckon</HI> in <HI>Numbers</HI> beyond <HI>five,</HI> would yet undertake to <HI>Compute</HI> the <HI>numbers</HI> of the <HI>Waves</HI> in the <HI>Sea,</HI> oras I may say in the words of <HI>S.

<P>A late great <HI>Philosopher</HI> of our Country hath told us, <HI>That every day it appeareth more and more that years and days are determin'd by Motions of the Earth;</HI> and another hath from the <HI>Diurnal</HI> and <HI>Annual</HI> Motion of the <HI>Earth</HI> endeavour'd to <HI>salve</HI> the <HI>Flows</HI> and <HI>Motions</HI> of some Seas, illustra|ting the same by Waterin a <HI>Bowl</HI> arising or falling to either side, according to the Motions of the Vessel: but perhaps should a <HI>Prince</HI> in his Writings inculcate the <HI>Philosophy</HI> of the <HI>Earths</HI> motion, the <HI>populace</HI> would have <HI>Fears</HI> and <HI>Iealousies</HI> of the instability of the Foundations of their Houses and Towns, and of the shaking of their <HI>Property,</HI> and as they have by <HI>Dispensations,</HI> and they would be apt to quote <HI>Scripture</HI> against such <HI>Mo|tion:</HI>

<P>I shall be most ready when we meet next (which I suppose will be very shortly) to afford you <HI>lumen de lumine,</HI> in any of the few things I know about this <HI>dark Learning.</HI> In the mean time I shall observe to you on the occasion of your Mentioning the <HI>Lord Chief Iustice</HI> Vaughan's <HI>Re|port</HI> of <HI>Thomas</HI> and <HI>Sorrell's Case,</HI> that as it hath through the Divine be|nignity been the frequent <HI>Method</HI> of <HI>Providence</HI> to send into the World unheard of <HI>Maladies</HI> and <HI>Remedies</HI> in the same <HI>Conjuncture</HI> of time, and so likewise to make pestiferous <HI>Haeresiarchs</HI> and learned <HI>Confessors</HI> of the truth <HI>Contemporary,</HI> and further when Heaven had made many of the in|quisitive curious to thirst after the knowledge of truth in the works of Nature, then to bless the World with the Discourses and Writings of <HI>Galilaeus, Tycho-Brahe,</HI> my Lord <HI>Bacon, Gassend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s</HI> and <HI>Des Cartes,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Harvey,</HI> who open'd such great <HI>Springs</HI> of real Learning as refresh'd that noble thirst; so it seems before the <HI>Date</HI> of His late Majesty's <HI>Decla|ration</HI> of <HI>Indulgence</HI> in the 24th <HI>year</HI> of his Reign, and of the <HI>Act</HI> about the <HI>Test</HI> in the 25th <HI>year</HI> of it, and both which were likely to produce among the <HI>Learned</HI> so many <HI>Inquiries</HI> into the <HI>Legality</HI> of the <HI>Dispensative</HI> Power inherent in the Crown (and even among the <HI>unlearned</HI> an <HI>Epidemical</HI> Di|sease of <HI>talking</HI> about the same) it came to pass in the course of Providence, that by as Learned <HI>Iudges</HI> as ever sate on the English <HI>Bench,</HI> and as Learned <HI>Councel</HI> as ever appear'd at its <HI>Bar,</HI> the <HI>Learning</HI> about the <HI>Dispensative</HI> Power was ventilated and discuss'd in a <HI>Series</HI> of several <HI>years</HI> in the Case of <HI>Thomas</HI> and <HI>Sorrell.</HI></P>
<P>For the Cause began in the King's <HI>Bench</HI> 18. <HI>Car.</HI> 2. and was there <HI>argued</HI> by some of the Great <HI>Councel</HI> of the Kingdom, and there again argued on both sides by other <HI>Councel</HI> in <HI>Michaelmas-Term,</HI> in the 19th <HI>year</HI> of his Reign. And in <HI>Hilary-Term</HI> in 25. and 26. <HI>Car.</HI> 2. this Cause for the <HI>weight</HI> and <HI>difficulty</HI> of it was <HI>adjourn'd</HI> out of the <HI>King's-Bench</HI> into the <HI>Exchequer</HI> Chamber, and there argued by others of the Greatest <HI>Councel</HI> of the Kingdom; and many <HI>Law-Books</HI> quoted. And the <HI>Case</HI> was afterward <HI>argued</HI> by all the <HI>Iudges</HI> of <HI>England</HI> at six several Days in <HI>Easter, Trinity, Michaelmas</HI> and <HI>Hilary</HI> Terms, <HI>viz.</HI> by two <HI>Iudges</HI> each day, and the <HI>Iudges</HI> differ'd in several Points, and even about the <HI>definition</HI> or <HI>meaning</HI> of <HI>Dispensation.</HI> For so that learned <HI>Chief Iustice</HI> tells you, and saith, That <HI>some of his Brothers defined it to be</HI> liberatio &agrave; poen&acirc;, <HI>and others to be</HI> Provida re|laxatio Juris, <HI>which</HI> (saith he) <HI>is defining an</HI> ignotum per ignotius, <HI>and</HI> liberare &agrave; poen&acirc; <HI>is the effect of a Pardon, not of a Dispensation,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Thus (as I may say) there was a <HI>Circumvallation</HI> by the Learning which concern'd <HI>Dispensing,</HI> that encompass'd some time <HI>preceding</HI> that <HI>Declara|tion</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="18">
of <HI>Indulgence</HI> in the <HI>24th</HI> year of his <HI>Reign,</HI> and some time <HI>following</HI> both it and the <HI>Act</HI> of the <HI>Test.</HI> I shall some other time perhaps entertain you with the Learned Manuscript <HI>Report</HI> of the whole <HI>Case:</HI> but shall now tell you that during that <HI>Series</HI> of <HI>years,</HI> there was no angry motion in the <HI>Sea</HI> of the <HI>Populace</HI> occasion'd by any thing said in any of the <HI>Arguments</HI> that propp'd up the <HI>Dispensative</HI> Power; no, not by that mention'd in <HI>Keeble's Reports</HI> about <HI>Thomas</HI> and <HI>Sorrell</HI>'s Case to have been said in the <HI>Exchequer Chamber</HI> by <HI>Ellis</HI> the <HI>King's Serjeant</HI> (and whose Opinion was as <HI>Currant</HI> for <HI>Sterling-Law</HI> as any Mans of the long Robe.) <HI>Viz. That the King may SUSPEND an Act of Parliament till next Session.</HI></P>
<P>And now since it hath thus appear'd out of that <HI>Chief Iustice</HI> his <HI>Report,</HI> that at least a sixth <HI>part</HI> of the Sworn <HI>Iudges</HI> of the <HI>Realm</HI> (as he thought) were unacquainted with the <HI>meaning</HI> of <HI>Dispensing,</HI> I think it may pass for a Miracle if any great number of the <HI>mobile</HI> did understand it.</P>
<P>But without their troubling their heads with <HI>Law-Books,</HI> if they would but mind their <HI>English</HI> Bibles, and there consult the <HI>12th</HI> of <HI>S. Mathew,</HI> they would soon forbear calling the lawful <HI>Dispensing with the Laws establish'd a Contradiction.</HI> Our learned <HI>Ames</HI> on <HI>the Priests in the Temple Prophaning the Sabbath and being blameless,</HI> observes very well in his <HI>Cases</HI> of <HI>Consci|ence,</HI> 1. 3. c. 17. That <HI>Praecepta Deiex su&acirc; natur&acirc; nunquam ita Concurrent, at necesse sit alterum eorum propri&egrave; violare per peccatum. Quum enim praecep|tum aliquod minus negligendum est, ut majus observetur, minus illud cessat pro illo tempore obligare</HI> (that is to say, is <HI>dispens'd</HI> with) <HI>ita ut qui ex tali oc|casione illud negligunt, sint plan&egrave; inculpabiles, id est non peccent.</HI> Matth. 12. 5, 7. And as to that in the <HI>Chapter</HI> of <HI>David's entring into the House of God and eating the Shew-bread, which was not lawful for him to eat,</HI> &amp;c. the Lord Bishop of <HI>London</HI> in his <HI>Second Letter to his Clergy,</HI> Printed <HI>A.</HI> 1680. in the Paragraph about <HI>The half Communion,</HI> occasionally thus observes with great Judgment, <HI>That a positive Command of God cannot be disobey'd without guilt, unless on some one or more of these grounds, either,</HI> 1. <HI>That God dispen|ses with it as he did with Circumcision in the Wilderness. Or,</HI> 2. <HI>That some Evil greater then the Consequence of the Non-Performance of it will certainly follow: as when David ate the Shew-bread and they that were with him: which depends on that rule of our Saviour, which tho apply'd to the Sabbath, yet ex|tends to all other positive Commands, that man was not made for them, but they for man: Or lastly, in case of incapacity, as the Children of Israels not going up to Ierusalem in the time of Captivity.</HI></P>
<P>And there are other words in a foregoing Chapter of S. <HI>Matthew</HI> that are still applicable to the <HI>Pharisaical</HI> ignorance of <HI>such as reproach DISPEN|SING</HI> as unlawful, <HI>Go and learn what that means, I will have mercy and not sacrifice.</HI></P>
<P>But according to the Example of our Blessed <HI>Lord</HI> in <HI>Having Compassion on the multitude,</HI> I think you have taken a just occasion for the <HI>pitying</HI> so ma|ny of your Countrymen who in the present Conjuncture presume to <HI>exer|cise themselves in great Matters, or in things too high for them</HI> relating to <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>State,</HI> and who without enquiring about the <HI>modus</HI> of <HI>Dispensing</HI> with the <HI>Laws</HI> establish'd, wherein <HI>Lawyers</HI> differ, cry down the thing it self wholly and absolutely as a <HI>Contradiction</HI> to the <HI>lex terrae,</HI> and in which not being so all <HI>Lawyers</HI> agree.</P>
<P>My Lord Primate <HI>Bramhal</HI> in his Book of <HI>A fair Warning to take heed of the Scottish Discipline,</HI> shewing in <HI>Chap. 6.</HI> (that I have before referred to) <HI>That it robs the King of his Dispensative Power,</HI> doth <HI>wish any one averse to that Power no greater Censure then that the Penal Laws might be duly executed on him till he recant his error.</HI> And how <HI>Penal</HI> a thing by the
<PB N="31" REF="18" MS="y">
<HI>Laws</HI> of <HI>Nations,</HI> it is to <HI>alienate</HI> the <HI>hearts</HI> of <HI>People</HI> from the <HI>Prince</HI>'s Go|vernment, all the great <HI>Writers</HI> of those Laws, and of the <HI>Iura Majestatis</HI> have enough shewn.</P>
<P>Moreover how <HI>Criminal,</HI> a thing of that Nature is in the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Con|science,</HI> our two great <HI>Writers</HI> of it, <HI>Ames</HI> and <HI>Sanderson</HI> have enough taught us. The <HI>Moral</HI> offices of <HI>Subjects</HI> toward their <HI>Princes</HI> are well set forth in <HI>Ames</HI> his <HI>Cases</HI> of <HI>Conscience,</HI> 1. 5. c. 25. and where he saith. <HI>De|bent ex singulari reverenti&acirc; cavere, ne temerarium judicium ferant de ipso|rum administrationes</HI> Exod. 21. 28. Eccles. 10. 20. 2 Pet. 2. 10. Jud. 8. <HI>Fundamentum hujus cautionis est,</HI> 1. <HI>Candor ille qui cum erga omnes debet adhiberi, tum singulariter erga Superiores.</HI> 2. <HI>Difficultas explorandi fontes &amp; causas negotiorum Publicorum.</HI> 3. <HI>Moderatio illa qu&acirc; leves infirmitates &amp; offensiones tolerare debemus, &amp; communi tranquillitati condonare.</HI></P>
<P>And Bishop <HI>Sanderson</HI> in his 11th <HI>Sermon, Ad aulam,</HI> shewing the <HI>incon|venience</HI> of <HI>rashly judging things to be unlawful,</HI> observes how <HI>thereby mens affections are ali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">nated from one another:</HI> and saith he, <HI>our own deceitful hearts must needs tell us, how hardly we think of those Men who do those things, we think unlawful: as for example, if we think dressing of Meat and using any recreations to be profanatious of the Lord's-Day, we must needs judg those men who do so use them, to be prophaners of the Lord's-Day;</HI> and he further observes, <HI>That Governours thereby come to be robbed of a great deal of that honour that is due to them from their People, both in their affe|ctions and subjection:</HI> and saith, <HI>if we have in our thoughts prejudged any of the things commanded by the Magistrate to be unlawful, our hearts will be sowred toward our Governours, and Men will directly, or indirectly and ob|liquely speak evil of them,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hobb</HI>'s writing of the <HI>passions,</HI> observes well, <HI>That the passion whose violence or continuance maketh madness, is either great vain glory, which is commonly called Pride and Self-conceit, or great dejection of Mind, and that excessive opinion of a Man's own self for divine Inspiration, for Wisdom, Learning, Form and the like becomes distraction and giddiness: the same joyn'd with Envy, Rage, vehement opinion of the truth of any thing contra|dicted by others, Rage,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and if the excesses be madness, there is no doubt but the Passions themselves when they tend to evil are degrees of the same.</HI> And therefore when we see so many <HI>Mechanical</HI> Persons, as to the Point of <HI>Dispensation</HI> in general, not allowing their own <HI>Rule</HI> of <HI>Cuilibet in su&acirc; arte credendum,</HI> so many <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Women,</HI> and such whom the <HI>Law</HI> terms <HI>Infants,</HI> so <HI>rude</HI> in the knowledge of the <HI>Law,</HI> and yet so <HI>transported</HI> with <HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>Self-Conceit,</HI> and such an <HI>excessive</HI> opinion of themselves for <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Knowledge,</HI> and for being <HI>inspired</HI> with new <HI>light</HI> in this <HI>dark Learning,</HI> none need wish them greater <HI>Punishment</HI> then such their <HI>Distem|per;</HI> adding thereunto the <HI>Pharisaical</HI> humour they have been so much abandon'd to, namely, of their own <HI>dispensing</HI> with <HI>Moral</HI> and <HI>Eternal</HI> Du|ties, and such as I have referr'd to in <HI>Ames</HI> and <HI>Sanderson,</HI> and things in their own nature <HI>indispensable,</HI> and which are the <HI>weightier Matters of the Law,</HI> while they cry out of the <HI>dispensing</HI> with Positive <HI>Rites</HI> and <HI>Institu|tions</HI> as <HI>illegal.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Having in <HI>p. 57, 58, 59.</HI> of the following Second Part occasionally dilated on the Common Place or Notion of Heaven having so often made so much use of the weight of one man in the balance of Government, I esteem'd my dedicating this Part of my Work to your Lordship but common Iustice to your Character, who have been the happy Instrument of God and the King in making so many Englishmen happy.</P>
<P>My Lord, It is but natural <HI>when the Just are in Authority, for the People to rejoice (as <HI>Solomon</HI> tells us)</HI> and for them like|wise to anticipate the Honours of the Prince's affording to a Person heroically just, by wishing them. And this is most properly applicable to your Lordship; and that in your Case may be said what <HI>Pliny</HI> in his <HI>Panegyric</HI> mentions of <HI>Nerva's</HI> adopting <HI>Trajan,</HI> That it was impossible it should have pleas'd all when it was done, except it had pleas'd all before it was done.</P>
<P>My Lord, It was Nature that prompted them to presage with Pleasure the Profit that would come to them from the accessions of Honour to you, and whereby they knew that the height of your Power would be naturally productive of Blessings to them as the height of Hills and Mountains is of Springs for the benefit of the lower Earth, and of those who inhabit it, and which are found wanting in Countrys where there are no Hills. And the Ancient placing of the Statues of Magistrates by Fountains, may be supposed to have been an indication of the Peoples valuing them as the Causers of what did console and refresh them.</P>
<P>My Lord, when I consider how much your Lordship and other just Persons of the Roman-Catholick Communion have in the per|formance of the moral Offices of Natural Obedience to your Prince obliged so many of his Subjects by your being helpful to them a|gainst Oppressions in their Estates and Consciences, I hope I shall not appear too sanguine in my Conjecture of any ferment soon na|turally ceasing about the exercise of the Dispensative Power being a <HI>gravamen</HI> to Property.</P>
<P>My Lord, I shall in the former of the two remaining Parts of this my Work (and which are both ready for the Press) entertain your Lordship with such a farther Assertion of those offices of that

<HI>Obedience</HI> call'd <HI>Natural,</HI> as I believe will give no offence to any <HI>Zealot,</HI> or <HI>Patriot,</HI> and as I have hitherto took care to give none to either: For tho I think it not deniable that our Princes may by their Laws <HI>limit</HI> the <HI>exercise</HI> of that <HI>Allegiance</HI> or <HI>Obe|dience,</HI> with respect to <HI>Circumstances,</HI> yet as no Humane Laws can legitimate the entire withdrawing of any part of the Obedience enjoin'd by the Divine Law natural or positive, so how our <HI>Lex <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">rrae</HI> hath not limited the exercise of the Regal Power from the <HI>Dispensing</HI> with <HI>Disability,</HI> as in the Case now so much agitated, I have shewn, and shall further. But I conceive it here necessary for me to acquaint your Lordship that I have been often put to it as speaking <HI>cum vulgo &amp; grosso modo,</HI> and for <HI>brevity</HI>'s sake to use the aforesaid Expression of <HI>Dispensing</HI> with <HI>Disability,</HI> and with Disability <HI>incurr'd</HI> by <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament,</HI> that is, with what is generally enacted to be incurr'd, and SEEMS to be alike <HI>in|curr'd</HI> by all Persons who perform not what the Act enjoins; and which Dispensing with Disability is frequently used in popular dis|course for the <HI>pardoning</HI> it, and for the <HI>liberatio &agrave; poen&acirc;,</HI> and as the Lord Chief Iustice <HI>Vaughan</HI>'s Report by me so much cited men|tions dispensing to have been defined by some of the Iudges.

<P>I again bid you welcome, and am ready to go on where we last left off, and do not in the least doubt of your welcoming any thing I can say to you that may import you to know in order to your <HI>sworn</HI> assi|stance and <HI>defence</HI> of every <HI>Privilege</HI> belonging to the Crown. And I shall frankly tell you, that you and other Protestants who in a late Con|juncture did shew a more then <HI>ordinary</HI> zeal against Popery or <HI>Papal</HI> Usur|pations, ought to consider that you have thereby put your selves under an <HI>especial</HI> Obligation of <HI>tenderness</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">for all the <HI>rights</HI> of your Prince, and of <HI>hating</HI> all <HI>popular</HI> Usurpations or <HI>diminutions</HI> thereof, with an <HI>exemplary</HI> and most <HI>perfect hatred,</HI> and of thereby avoiding the being judged <HI>hypo|crites</HI> and factious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do herein most fully agree with you: and that the late <HI>zeal</HI> of the same Persons against <HI>papal</HI> Usurpations, and for <HI>popular</HI> ones was a scandal to the Age. I remember you once observ'd to me, how <HI>tender</HI> the <HI>Pro|testants</HI> in the times of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and King <HI>Iames</HI> the first, were of every <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Privilege</HI> of the Crown with the most <HI>perfect tenderness,</HI> while the Attaques from the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> against those Princes had made the highest Ferment in the minds of the Populace. But I think there never was any Conjuncture of time here, when so many of the declaimers a|gainst Popery, and so many of the <HI>fautors</HI> of Plot-witnesses were so much at the same time for <HI>a Plot</HI> and <HI>no Plot,</HI> and for <HI>a King and no King;</HI> that is to say, did so much make a stalking-horse of Popery, whereby to strike at Prerogative.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you know that the <HI>talk</HI> of <HI>Plots</HI> and <HI>Popery</HI> was before apply'd to that use. You know <HI>Archbishop Laud</HI> in his <HI>Star-chamber Speech&punc;</HI> A 1637. mentions it p. 11. <HI>as the scope of the Libellers</HI> of the Faction <HI>to kindle a jealousy in Mens minds, that there were some great Plots in hand to change the Religion established, and to bring in (I know not what) Romish Super|stition.</HI> And the history of those times sheweth you how the Men that cry'd up <HI>Plots</HI> then did <HI>decry</HI> Prerogative. And in the Conjuncture of 41. the famous <HI>Protestation</HI> of <HI>May</HI> the 5th that year, begins with Out-cries of <HI>Designs of Popish Priests and Iesuits and other Papists and their PLOTS and CONSPIRACIES,</HI> and the Preface of the <HI>Covenant</HI> runs on in the <HI>style</HI> of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">loody Plots and Conspiracies:</HI> But you likewise know the dismal state of <HI>Prerogative</HI> in those times then occasion'd by raising of those false Alarms of <HI>Plots.</HI></P>
<P>And I may account it as a beneficial Providence to the Age, that short|ly after our last <HI>Plot-Epoche, M^r. Hobbs</HI> his <HI>History of the Civil-Wars</HI> com|ing first out in print through the License of the Press (and having been reserved to the detecting then the <HI>artifices</HI> of the Demagogues that produ|ced the <HI>Usurpations</HI> between the Years 1640. and 1660.) the Book notwithstanding all the prejudice against the <HI>Author</HI> (whether just or unjust) being writ with so much strength and beauty of Wit, as to make it <HI>fly</HI> like <HI>lightning</HI> round the Kingdom in so many Impressions, did then prove to many ingenious and thinking Men an effectual <HI>Antidote</HI> against the poysons of those old Artifices then again scatter'din the <HI>Press,</HI> being so destructive to Loyalty as heretofore.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Iohn Davis</HI> in his <HI>Report</HI> of the <HI>Case of praemunire Hil.</HI> 4. <HI>Iacobi</HI> doth but right to the <HI>loyalty</HI> of Roman Catholicks and to the <HI>genius</HI> of the <HI>People</HI> of <HI>England</HI> when he saith there, <HI>That the Commons of England may</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="21" MS="y">
<HI>be an example to all other Subjects in the World, in this, that they have ever been TENDER and sensible of the wrongs and dishonours offer'd to their Kings, and have ever contended to upheld and maintain their Honour and Soveraignty. And their Faith and Loyalty hath been generally such (tho every Age hath brought forth some particular M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">nsters of disloyal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">y) as no pretence of Zeal of Religion could ever withdraw the greater part of the Subjects of submit themselves to a foreign yoke; no, not when Popery was in its height and exaltation.</HI></P>
<P>It is therefore no marvel that toward the latter end of the Reign of the late King, the very <HI>Mobile</HI> who had been so <HI>zealous</HI> against <HI>papal</HI> usur|pations, and so <HI>fiery</HI> in charging <HI>ALL Papists</HI> with <HI>disloyalty,</HI> did upon their discovery of the artifices of republican deluders to put an inglorious <HI>do|mestic</HI> yoke on the <HI>Monarchy,</HI> then think themselves obliged by the univer|sality of their <HI>loyal</HI> addresses to shew the more <HI>extraordinary</HI> zeal against any <HI>Popular</HI> Usurpations. And so I account it but natural to you who are made <HI>&egrave; meliore luto,</HI> to be ready to shew your most <HI>consummate</HI> zeal for every <HI>Privilege</HI> of the Crown.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not possible for any Man to wish me more sensible of my <HI>obli|gation</HI> in this point then I really am: and the rather for that I find so many mens <HI>loyalty</HI> to be but a kind of loud <HI>noisy</HI> nothing, or a metaphysical <HI>uni|versale,</HI> however they may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ansie it to be a <HI>real</HI> being: but what I know cannot <HI>exist</HI> a part from the <HI>particular</HI> Rights and <HI>Privileges</HI> belonging to the Crown being <HI>assisted</HI> and <HI>defended,</HI> and from a serious endeavour to understand the truth about their belonging to it. And my <HI>solicitousness</HI> to find out which in the <HI>shortest</HI> way possible and <HI>particularly</HI> as to the <HI>Pri|vilege</HI> of discharging <HI>incapacity</HI> or <HI>disability</HI> incurr'd by <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament,</HI> (as I told you at our last meeting) engaged me to <HI>divert</HI> you out of the <HI>course</HI> of your method, and whereupon you told me you would refer my thoughts to the <HI>Assertory</HI> part of the <HI>Oath.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well: what ever <HI>damps</HI> I may see on <HI>English</HI> Mens <HI>loyalty,</HI> or dege|neracy from its <HI>nature</HI> by the <HI>arts</HI> of faction a while perverting them not to <HI>assist</HI> and <HI>defend</HI> this or that <HI>Privilege</HI> of the Crown, I shall never de|spair of their coming again to themselves: and that tho as in a <HI>vessel</HI> of <HI>Water</HI> and <HI>Oyl,</HI> while any one is shaking it, the Water may over-top the Oyl, so likewise in their minds while shaken and stirred by Demagogues the <HI>Oyl</HI> of <HI>the Lord's anointed</HI> is not there uppermost; yet that through its own nature, and through the <HI>English</HI> good nature and their <HI>natural</HI> addi|ction to <HI>Religion,</HI> it will in time naturally appear to be so.</P>
<P>And now to go on without further <HI>prefacing</HI> on either side, what if I should tell you that it imports you to consider, that in in the <HI>Assertory</HI> part of the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Supremacy,</HI> you have declared and asserted that <HI>authority,</HI> as <HI>due to the King <HI>that was challenged and used by king</HI></HI> Henry <HI>the</HI> 8th <HI>and</HI> Edward <HI>the</HI> 6th, that is, that <HI>the King under God, hath the Sove|raignty and Rule over all manner of Persons born within these his Realms of what Estate either Ecclesiastical or Temporal so ever, so as no other foreign Power, shall or ought to have any superiority over them?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would then tell you, that you have mentioned some things to be in this <HI>Oath,</HI> that I remember not to be there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant that I mention'd to you somethings that are not <HI>express'd</HI> in the <HI>Oath,</HI> and in the form of it as it is <HI>administred,</HI> and was <HI>enacted</HI> 1 <HI>Eliz.</HI> c. 1. and by which <HI>Act</HI> the refusers of such Oath are punish'd with DIS|ABILITY to bear <HI>Office.</HI> But in the same year in which that <HI>Act</HI> pass'd, <HI>Queen Elizabeth</HI> in an ADMONITION annext to her <HI>Injunctions,</HI> thought
<PB N="41" REF="21" MS="y">
fit to exercise her <HI>Royal</HI> authority of the <HI>Interpretation</HI> or <HI>Declaration</HI> of the sense of that <HI>Oath</HI> enjoyn'd by <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament;</HI> and in that <HI>Admoni|tion</HI> you will find those words that you remember not in the <HI>Oath</HI> you took: as likewise her ACQUITTAL of all Persons from <HI>all</HI> manner of <HI>Pe|nalties,</HI> and consequently of <HI>disability,</HI> who took the <HI>Oath</HI> according to the sense of it publish'd in her <HI>Interpretation.</HI> And if you consult the Act, you will see that the <HI>disabilities</HI> inflicted in the <HI>Act</HI> on the refusers of the <HI>Oath</HI> are <HI>various.</HI> And thus then you see, that as soon as you have done taking the <HI>Oath,</HI> you are immediately call'd on by your Conscience to <HI>defend</HI> the <HI>Privilege</HI> and <HI>preeminence</HI> of your <HI>Prince,</HI> viz. of <HI>interpreting</HI> his Laws, and of discharging the <HI>disabilities</HI> thereby inflicted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I now remember that I have read that <HI>Admonition</HI> of the <HI>Queens;</HI> but I account <HI>Proclamations, Injunctions,</HI> and <HI>Admonitions</HI> of <HI>Princes</HI> to be but <HI>temporary</HI> Laws, and that therefore this <HI>Interpretation</HI> of the <HI>Queen's</HI> and her discharging of <HI>Disabilities</HI> expired with her Reign.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>To obviate such thought, I shall tell you that in the <HI>Act</HI> of the 5th of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> c. 1. and by which the Refusal of the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Suprema|cy</HI> is punish'd more severely then by the before-mention'd <HI>disability,</HI> viz. by <HI>Proemunire</HI> for the first <HI>Refusal,</HI> and by making it <HI>Treason</HI> for some Per|sons to <HI>refuse</HI> it a <HI>second</HI> time (but <HI>Penalties</HI> that none ever doubted but the <HI>Crown</HI> might by its <HI>Pardon</HI> discharge) there is a <HI>Proviso</HI> that the <HI>Oath</HI> (viz. of Supremacy) <HI>expressed in the said Act made in the said first year, shall be takeu and expounded in such form as is set forth in an Admonition annexd to the Queens Majesties Injunctions Publish'd in the first year of her Reign, that is to say to confess and acknowledge in her Majesty, her Heirs and Successors, none other Authority then was challenged, and lately used by the Noble King</HI> Henry <HI>the Eighth, and King</HI> Edward <HI>the Sixth, as in the said Admonition may more plainly appear.</HI> And this too lets you see that the <HI>Parliament</HI> by thus referring to the Queen's <HI>Admonition</HI> did <HI>approve</HI> of her Power therein exercised, and of her having <HI>acquitted</HI> her Subjects from the Punishment of <HI>disability.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must then, I see, fairly grant you that by that <HI>Parliament</HI>'s having thus perpetuated the <HI>interpretation</HI> of the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Supremacy</HI> contain'd in <HI>Queen</HI> Elizabeth'<HI>s Admonition,</HI> I am bound in Conscience to take it in that <HI>sense,</HI> and am perjured if I do not so keep that Oath; and must likewise grant that you have shewn how <HI>auspicious</HI> that <HI>Oath</HI> by the Queens <HI>inter|preting</HI> the same, and the <HI>Parliament</HI> about five years after <HI>approving</HI> that <HI>Interpretation,</HI> was to the Assertion of such her Power; and that if any taker of the <HI>Oath</HI> should <HI>gain-say</HI> such Power, you have prepared such a <HI>Con|futation</HI> in the case as was used to the old Philosopher who disputed against <HI>Motion,</HI> and whom his Adversary confuted by removing him from his place. But as you are a fair arguer, I am to take leave to tell you, That that <HI>Parliament,</HI> tho they approved the Queen's <HI>Admonition</HI> in general, did not particularly shew their Approbation of the Queen's Power of dispensing with the <HI>Penalties</HI> that she exercised in that <HI>Admonition.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>They did sufficiently shew their Approbation of the whole; and there|fore you need not question their approving of its parts. But because you seem to lay some stress on that Parliament's not expresly approving <HI>in terminis</HI> the Queen's Power of discharging the <HI>Penalties</HI> (and one of which by the <HI>Act</HI> of 1^o <HI>Elizabethoe</HI> was <HI>disability</HI>) I shall tell you that whereas Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> had thought it expedient for the Supporting of the <HI>Consecration</HI> of the <HI>Bishops</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> to <HI>dispense</HI> with whatever might cause <HI>Disability,</HI> according to her <HI>Supream</HI> Authority, by her <HI>Letters Pa|tents,</HI> the very same Parliament at their next <HI>Session</HI> did 8^o <HI>Elizabethoe,</HI> c. 1.
<PB N="42" REF="22" MS="y">
<HI>in terminis terminantibus</HI> declare their Approbations of the Queens <HI>dispen|sing</HI> with <HI>disability by those Letters Patents:</HI> for it having been in that <HI>Statute</HI> mention'd, that <HI>for the avoiding of all Ambiguities and Questions that might be objected against the lawful Confirmations, investings and Consecrations of the said Archbishops and Bishops, her Highness in her Letters Patents under the Great Seal of</HI> England, <HI>&amp;c. <HI>hath used and put in her said Letters Patents divers other general words and Senten|ces, whereby her Highness by her Supreme Power and Authority hath DISPENS'D with all Causes or doubts of any Imperfection or DISABILITY that can or may in any wise be objected against the same,</HI></HI> &amp;c. it follows, <HI>That all Acts and things heretofore had, made or done by any Person about any Consecration, Confirmation or Investing of any Person elected to the Office or Dignity of any Archbishop or Bi|shop,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>by Uirtue of the Queens Majesty's Letters Patents or Com|mission,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>be and shall be by Authority of this present Parliament de|clared, judged and deemed at and from every of the several times of the doing thereof good and perfect to all respects and purposes: any matter or thing that can or may be objected to the contrary thereof in any wise notwithstanding.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>E. Cook</HI> in the <HI>4th</HI> part of his <HI>Iustitutes.</HI> c. 74. viz. <HI>Of Ecclesiastical Courts,</HI> takes notice how <HI>our adversaries had made objections against our Archbishops and Bishops consecrated about the beginning of the reign of Queen</HI> Eliz. and consequently against the <HI>Bishops</HI> ever since: <HI>That they were never consecrated according to law, because they had not three Bishops at least at their Consecration, and never a Bishop at all, as was pretended, be|cause they being Bishops in the reign of</HI> Edward <HI>the</HI> 6th <HI>were deprived in the reign of Queen</HI> Mary, <HI>and were not (as was pretended) restored before their presence at the Consecration. These pretences being but Cavils are an|swer'd by the Statute of</HI> 8^o Eliz. <HI>c.</HI> 1. <HI>and provision made by authority of that Parliament, for the establishing of Archbishops and Bishops, both in proesenti and in futuro in their Bishopricks.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>Mason</HI> in his <HI>3d Book</HI> c. <HI>7th. De ministerio Anglicano,</HI> in his answer|ing the <HI>objection,</HI> hath recourse to the Queens <HI>Patents</HI> referr'd to by the Statute of 8^o <HI>Eliz.</HI> and having mention'd the Queen's <HI>dispensing</HI> by her <HI>su|preme</HI> authority <HI>cum quavis caus&acirc; aut suspicione c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">jusvis DEFECTUS, aut INABILITATIS quoe quovis modo contra eorum consecrationem obten|di poterat,</HI> he saith, <HI>verba in diplomate Regio sic se habent, <HI>supplentes nihilominus suprema authoritate nostra Regia ex mero motu &amp; certa scientia nostris, si quid in hiis quae juxta mandatum nostrum per vos fient, aut in vobis aut vestrum aliquo, conditione, statu, aut fa|cultate vestris ad praemissa perficienda desit, aut deerit, eorum quae per statuta hujus Regni, aut per leges ecclesiasticas in hac parte requirun|tur, aut necessaria sunt, temporis ratione aut rerum necessitate sic po|stulante:</HI></HI> and then adds, <HI>unde serenissima Regina ut omnem calumniandi ansam proecidere, ipsique invidioeos obstruere posset,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>DISPENSARE dignata est, siquid forte Lynceis oculis invidia, alicujus statuti vel canonis violati proetextu possit obtendere.</HI> And then having brought in his Po|pish opponents objection, <HI>Hem quid audio?

<P>And so I doubt not but you mind the <HI>words</HI> in that <HI>Act</HI> relating to the Queen's <HI>Letters Patents,</HI> viz. <HI>shall be by authority of the Parliament</HI> (not made good, for they were so before, but) <HI>declared, judged and deem'd good.</HI></P>

<P>But to return to the Consideration of what you are on the whole matter obliged to by virtue of the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Supremacy</HI> in the Case now before you: and herein I find that by Virtue of the Queens <HI>interpretation</HI> of that Oath, and the Parliaments <HI>Approbation</HI> thereof, that when in the <HI>Assertory</HI> part of the Oath <HI>you do utterly testify and declare in your Conscience that the King's Highness is the only Supreme Governor of this Realm as well in all Spiritual or Ecclesiastical things or Causes as Temporal,</HI> you have as in the Presence of God solemnly given your cordial Assent to, and made your most <HI>Religious</HI> acknowledgment that the <HI>SOLE Supreme Government or Soveraignty</HI> and Rule under God over all manner of Persons born within these Realms, is in the King; and you are obliged to judge that tho the <HI>Oath</HI> speaks of <HI>all Spiritual or Ecclesiastical THINGS or Causes,</HI> and the <HI>interpretation</HI> of all manner of <HI>Persons</HI> of what Estate ei|ther Ecclesiastical or Temporal soever they be, yet there is no inconsistence between the <HI>Oath</HI> and the <HI>Interpretation,</HI> for that as a Learned man in his <HI>Comment</HI> on that <HI>Oath</HI> hath well observ'd, <HI>there is no Opposition between these two, Persons and Causes; the Principal object of a Law is a Person, and a Person with respect to his Actions, a Person morally Consider'd;</HI> and he there quotes <HI>Suarez de Legibus,</HI> l. 1. c. 8. saying, <HI>Ad leges per se requiri|tur potestas in personam, secundario in Res alias:</HI> and for that the <HI>Asserto|ry</HI> clause in the <HI>Oath</HI> declaring the King the <HI>only</HI> Supreme Governor of <HI>this</HI> Realm, doth necessarily imply his being the <HI>only</HI> Supreme Governor of all Persons in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>But perhaps you did not take notice that probably one reason why Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> was willing that her <HI>Interpretation</HI> that related to the <HI>Assertory</HI> part of the <HI>Oath,</HI> I mean as to her Power over all the Persons of her Subjects, and which was Publish'd in the <HI>Admonition</HI> after her <HI>Injun|ctions,</HI> should in the aforesaid Act in the <HI>5th</HI> year of her Reign be approved in Parliament, might be to satisfie the scrupulousness of some mens Tender Consciences, and who might thereby think that according to the Rule of <HI>ejus est interpretari cujus est condere,</HI> that the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Supremacy</HI> enjoyn'd by Parliament 1^o <HI>Elizabethoe</HI> could not receive an <HI>Interpretation</HI> but from
<PB N="38" REF="23">
the <HI>Queen</HI> in <HI>Parliament,</HI> and that that Consideration might therefore be supposed to be the cause of the Queens <HI>interpreting,</HI> being approved or <HI>de|clared</HI> good by the <HI>Parliament</HI> in the <HI>Fifth</HI> year of her Reign.</P>

<P>I shall tell you that as to the sufficiency of the <HI>Queen's</HI> Power to <HI>in|terpret</HI> the <HI>Oath</HI> by her <HI>sole</HI> Authority, it appears not that the <HI>Proviso</HI> in the <HI>Statute</HI> of 5 <HI>Eliz.</HI> did in the least arise from any such <HI>scruple,</HI> and so <HI>De non apparentibus,</HI> &amp;c. And here without troubling you with the No|tions of the <HI>Royal</HI> assent creating the <HI>Soul</HI> of the <HI>Law,</HI> and by the words of <HI>le Roy le veult&punc;</HI> after the <HI>Body</HI> of it hath been prepared by the <HI>three</HI> Estates and that the <HI>three</HI> Estates have nothing to do to <HI>interpret</HI> a <HI>Law</HI> that is once made, and accordingly as Sir <HI>C. Hatton,</HI> formerly <HI>Lord Chancellor</HI> of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> in his <HI>Treatise of Acts of Parliament and their Exposition,</HI> tells us, That <HI>the Assembly of Parliament being ended, functi sunt officio,</HI> and speaking par|ticularly of those of the <HI>Lower House,</HI> saith <HI>their Authority is return'd to the Electors so clearly, that if they were all together assembled again for inter|pretation by a voluntary meeting,</HI> eorum non esset interpretari, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I shall once for all observe to you, that our <HI>Monarchs</HI> when in the exercise of the Prerogative inherent in them, and inseparable from them, relating to Mat|ters of <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>War,</HI> the <HI>Coining</HI> of Money, or the <HI>Dispensing</HI> in Matters Civil or Ecclesiastical, they condescend to have the same in particular <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ases approved or strength<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">n'd by Parliament, are no more deprived of their <HI>Sole</HI> Supremacy therein, then the <HI>Body</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> is devested of its Heat and Light by diffusing the same through the Air.</P>
<P>But I have before observ'd to you, that the apparent Cause in the <HI>Proviso</HI> of 5^o <HI>Elizabethoe,</HI> whereby the Queens <HI>Interpretation</HI> is Enacted, is the better to transmit the obligatoriness of the Interpretation in point of Con|science beyond her Life, and to the Reigns of her <HI>Heirs</HI> and <HI>Successors,</HI> and to bind us who live now to acknowledge such Power due to our pre|sent King over the Persons of all his Subjects, as was in her interpretation challenged to be due to <HI>Harry</HI> the Eighth and <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth.</P>
<P>I shall not trouble you with my Judgment about <HI>Moot-points</HI> of <HI>Law</HI> re|lating to the <HI>Regal</HI> Power of interpreting <HI>Acts</HI> of Parliament, and particu|larly such wherein Oaths are founded. My Lord <HI>Coke,</HI> Inst. 3. c. 74. tells us, <HI>That an Oath cannot be ministred to any, unless the same be allow'd by the Common Law, or by some Act of Parliament: neither can any Oath al|low'd by the Common-Law, or by Act of Parliament, be alter'd but by Act of Parliament:</HI> and saith in the Margin, <HI>So resolv'd,</HI> An. 26. El. <HI>in the Case of the Under-Sheriff.</HI> And then saith <HI>the Oath of the King's Privy Councel, the Iustices, the Sheriffs,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>was thought fit to be alter'd and enlarged, but that was done by Authority of Parliament. For further proof whereof see the Statutes here quoted</HI> (i. e. those referr'd to in his Margin) <HI>and it shall evidently appear that no old Oath can be alter'd or new Oath rais'd without an Act of Parliament.</HI></P>
<P>I have only here referr'd you to <HI>Matters</HI> of <HI>Fact</HI> in the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> a Reign that the Royal <HI>Martyr</HI> in <HI>p.</HI> 3. of his <HI>Declaration to all his Loving Subjects</HI> of <HI>Aug.</HI> 12. 1642. refers to with so much honour by saying, <HI>We declared our Resolution,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and desired that whatsoever mistaking had grown in the Government either of Church or State might be removed, and all things reduced to the order of the time (the memory whereof is justly precious to this Nation) of Queen</HI> Elizabeth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and do leave it to you to consider how <HI>Great</HI> the <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>Interpretation</HI> of Laws is in it self; a Power almost infinitely greater then the discharging either the Obligations of some Penal Laws or their Penalties <HI>Pro hic &amp; nu c,</HI> and as to some particular Persons, as any one will grant who hath seen the extent of
<PB N="39" REF="23">
the Power of interpreting in the <HI>Canon</HI> Law, where the <HI>Glossa ad Cap.

And you may consider that if the <HI>Queen</HI> did contrary to the measures of Law referr'd to in my Lord <HI>Coke,</HI> by her <HI>sole</HI> Supream Ecclesia|stical Authority, <HI>seem</HI> to <HI>alter</HI> the <HI>interpretation</HI> of a <HI>Stature Oath</HI> for the better, what she did found afterward its approbation in Parliament: and in fine; I leave it to you to consider how much the Power of <HI>dispensing</HI> with any Law may be thought <HI>Coincident</HI> with <HI>interpreting,</HI> since as I shall some other time shew you at large that the <HI>dispensing</HI> with Laws, is in effect the <HI>equitable</HI> interpreting that in such and such cases and circumstances they were not intended, and ought not to bind, but ought to be relax'd.</P>
<P>And now I must take the occasion offer'd me to give you a prospect of the Queens <HI>Dispensative</HI> Power, both of the <HI>Interpretation</HI> of this <HI>Oath,</HI> and of the acquittal from <HI>Disabilities</HI> that is not bounded by the <HI>Statutes</HI> of 5^o or 8^o <HI>Elizabethoe</HI> beforemention'd, and wherein she again stood on the single <HI>basis</HI> of her own <HI>Supreme</HI> Authority Ecclesiastical, without having recourse then to a Parliaments approbation. Mr. <HI>Ney</HI> in his learned Obser|vations on the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">premacy&punc;</HI> having spoke of the Queens <HI>Interpreta|tion</HI> of the <HI>Oath</HI> in her <HI>Admonition,</HI> and of the Parliamentary <HI>Proviso</HI> 5^o <HI>Eliz.</HI> doth thus go on, <HI>There is something of Explication further</HI> (meaning of the Oath) <HI>in the Arti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">les of Religion concluded in the year</HI> 1562, <HI>and then re|cites the 37th Article as followeth,</HI> viz. <HI>The Queens Majesty hath the Chief Power in this Realm of</HI> England, <HI>and other her Dominions, unto whom the Chief Government of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> Estates of this Realm, whether they be Ecclesiastical or Civil in all Causes doth appertain, and is not nor ought to be subject to any foreign Iurisdiction. Where we attribute to her Majesty the Chief Government, by which Title we understand the minds of some slanderous Folks to be offended, we give not to our Prin|ces the ministring either of Gods Word, or of the Sacraments, the which thing the Injunctions also lately set forth by</HI> Elizabeth <HI>our Queen do most plainly testify, but that only Prerogative which we see to have been given always to all Godly Princes in holy Scriptures by God him|self, that is, that they should rule all Estates and Degrees committed to their charge by God, whether they be Ecclesiastical or Temporal, and restrain with the Civil Sword the stubborn and evil doers.</HI></P>

<P>Now after the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Supremacy</HI> had been enjoyn'd in the <HI>first</HI> year of her Reign, and the <HI>Admonition</HI> annexed to her <HI>Injunctions</HI> was then like|wise

And in the <HI>Articles</HI> there was by the <HI>Queens</HI> Royal <HI>Preroga|tive</HI> an additional <HI>Interpretation</HI> probably at the instance of the <HI>Clergy</HI> gi|ven to the <HI>interpretation,</HI> in the <HI>Admonition&punc;</HI> and in the Parliaments <HI>Provi|so:</HI> and the which <HI>additional</HI> interpretation had in it no respect to, nor mention of what, being in several places of the former one, might <HI>a|muse</HI> the <HI>Clergy</HI> with some <HI>Fears</HI> and <HI>Iealousies,</HI> namely the <HI>Duty, Allegi|ance and Bond that were acknowledged due to</HI> Harry <HI>the</HI> 8th <HI>and</HI> Edward <HI>the</HI> 6th, <HI>and the Authority that was challenged and lately used by those Prin|ces;</HI> however yet that latter Clause is qualify'd in the Admonition. But for the <HI>37th Article</HI> before-mentioned allowing the measures of the Royal <HI>Supremacy</HI> from the <HI>Prerogatives <HI>given by God in Scripture to holy Prin|ces,</HI></HI> whereby our <HI>Clergy</HI> might seem to have brought the Prerogative in|to its own proper <HI>Element,</HI> and theirs too (the knowledge of the Scriptures being their <HI>profession</HI>) our <HI>Clergy</HI> no doubt were always thankful to the Crowns <HI>Dispensative</HI> power, and so exercised out of Parliament: and where|by they were secured from penal <HI>disabilities</HI> either by <HI>suspension</HI> or <HI>depri|vation</HI> for not taking the Oath in the <HI>sense</HI> of the <HI>Admonition.</HI></P>
<P>Thus as things in their <HI>proper</HI> place are at rest, the Queens <HI>Dispensative</HI> power and the <HI>Consciences</HI> of the Clergy by this interpretation of the Oath were so much at <HI>rest,</HI> that about <HI>eight</HI> or <HI>nine</HI> years afterward the same 39 Articles that had been by the <HI>Archbishops</HI> and <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Clergy</HI> of both <HI>Provinces</HI> agreed on in the year 1562. were by the said <HI>Archbishops, Bishops</HI> and <HI>Clergy</HI> again <HI>agreed</HI> upon, and again <HI>ratify'd</HI> by the Queen in the <HI>year</HI> 1571. the <HI>13th year</HI> of her reign, and when care was taken by the Government that that <HI>interpretation</HI> being incorporated in the body of the 39 <HI>Articles</HI> should be <HI>deem'd good</HI> in <HI>Parliament</HI> by the <HI>Statute</HI> of 13^o <HI>Eliz. c.</HI> 12. as the other <HI>interpretation</HI> in the <HI>Admonition</HI> had been by the <HI>proviso</HI> in the <HI>Act</HI> of the <HI>5th</HI> of that <HI>Queen,</HI> and probably for the same reason: and as her dispensing with <HI>disability</HI> expresly in the <HI>8th</HI> year of her reign was.</P>
<P>In the Act of the <HI>13th</HI> of <HI>Eliz.</HI> reference was made to those <HI>Articles</HI> as agreed on by the <HI>Archbishops</HI> and <HI>Clergy</HI> and set forth by the Queens au|thority <HI>Anno</HI> 1562. and the Act is entituled, <HI>Reformation of Disorders in the Ministers of the Church,</HI> and in which it was enacted, That <HI>all such as were to be ordained or permitted to preach or to be insti|tuted into any Benefice with cure of Souls, should publickly sub|scribe to the said Articles;</HI> which shews (if you mind it) that tho the Parliament did well <HI>allow</HI> and <HI>approve</HI> of the said <HI>Articles,</HI> yet the said <HI>Book</HI> oweth neither <HI>Conf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">rmation,</HI> nor <HI>Authority</HI> to the <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament.</HI> And that <HI>Act</HI> concerning only <HI>Clergy-men,</HI> tho the <HI>interpretation</HI> in the <HI>37th Article</HI> is left to oblige the <HI>Clergy,</HI> yet that in the <HI>Admonition</HI> might concern you to stick to, if nothing had since happen'd whereby the <HI>dispen|sative</HI> power inherent in the <HI>Crown,</HI> may have given your <HI>Conscience</HI> the benefit of the <HI>interpretation</HI> thus afforded to the <HI>Clergy.</HI></P>

<P>Look you to that who have taken the <HI>Oath,</HI> and do you consider how far you are by the <HI>Interpretations</HI> that I have referr'd you to, obliged to take your measures in the Matter that lies now before you, as to your assist|ing and defending the Prerogative of the <HI>Dispensative</HI> Power: and I likewise recommend it to you to observe how much to the satisfaction and ease of the minds of the generality His Majesty's <HI>Lay-Subjects,</HI> he by <HI>Connivence</HI> hath <HI>dispens'd</HI> with their not troubling themselves to study the <HI>Duty, Bond,</HI> or <HI>Al|legian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e</HI> that was acknowledged to be <HI>due to Henry</HI> the <HI>8th,</HI> or <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>6th,</HI> or the <HI>Prerogative given by God to Godly Princes in the Scripture, or the Christian Emperors</HI> in the <HI>Primitive</HI> times: for however our <HI>Divines</HI> are by the 39 <HI>Articles</HI> and the <HI>Canons</HI> of King <HI>Iames,</HI> and King <HI>Charles</HI> the First particularly obliged to <HI>study</HI> these Points, and that the knowledge of the same may oblige Men of <HI>learning</HI> and <HI>leisure</HI> among the <HI>Layety</HI> to Con|duct their <HI>Consciences</HI> thereby in their observance of this <HI>Oath,</HI> yet His Ma|jesty's not <HI>reviving</HI> among all his Subjects by any <HI>Proclamation</HI> or Ecclesia|stical <HI>Injunction</HI> or otherwise, the <HI>notices</HI> of these forgotten things, cannot but be acceptable to the generality of them as a <HI>Dispensation</HI> by <HI>Connivence.</HI> And therefore in <HI>Complaisance</HI> with, and gratitude to him, they are by the Law of Nature bound to give him what is plainly his <HI>Due,</HI> according to the plain <HI>Oath</HI> tender'd to and taken by them, and to take care that they do not exercise an Illegal Power of <HI>dispensing</HI> by way of <HI>Interpretation</HI> of that <HI>Oath</HI> to the Subversion of the sense of the Assertory and Promissory parts of it; both which are the Supporters of the Royal Dispensative Power.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="25" MS="y">But reserving for some other time my thoughts relating to the <HI>Dispensa|tive</HI> Power exercised by the Godly <HI>Princes</HI> in Holy <HI>Scripture,</HI> and by the Christian <HI>Emperors,</HI> I shall desire you now to look on your Oath in the plain natural sense of it, and as much as if no <HI>authoritative</HI> one had ever been given of it. Consider, that when you declare the <HI>King</HI> is the <HI>only</HI> Su|preme <HI>Governor</HI> of this <HI>Realm,</HI> or Governor of all Persons in it, no <HI>Humane</HI> Laws can bind our <HI>Consciences</HI> by any disability Penal incurr'd from <HI>serving</HI> him.

<P>As Dr. <HI>Donne</HI> in his <HI>Pseudo-Martyr</HI> observ'd well concerning the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Allegiance, All the Substance of the Oath is virtually contain'd in the first Proposition, That King</HI> James <HI>IS lawful King of all these Dominions, the rest are but Declarations and Branches naturally and necessarily proceeding from that root,</HI> the same as to the <HI>Point</HI> we are upon may be verify'd of the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Supremacy, The King's Highness IS the only Supream Governor of this Realm</HI> (not <HI>shall be</HI> by virtue of this Act) <HI>IS SO</HI> notwithstanding any thing that hath been done, or is a doing, and whereby any <HI>former</HI> Princes supposed <HI>de facto</HI> consenting to tye up his hands from Governing all his Subjects, and ranging them in their Stations in his <HI>Service,</HI> is out of the Case of your <HI>Oath,</HI> who have sworn thus, that King <HI>Iames</HI> the Second <HI>IS the only Supreme Governor,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Since therefore you have in your <HI>Oath</HI> acknowledged that <HI>the King is the only Supream Governor,</HI> and that according to the 37th <HI>Article</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England, He HATH the rule of all Estates and Degrees committed to his charge BY GOD, whether they be Ecclesiastical or Civil,</HI> I will ask you, if any <HI>Humane</HI> Law can <HI>disable</HI> any Persons from being govern'd by him, more then it can <HI>Children</HI> from <HI>honouring</HI> their <HI>Parents.</HI> According to those words in <HI>Malachi, <HI>If then I be a Father, where is my honour? and if I be a Master, where is my fear,</HI></HI> &amp;c. may it not be said to every Subject, <HI>while the King IS your King,</HI> while he <HI>is</HI> your only <HI>Supreme</HI> Governor, and while he <HI>is</HI> your Political <HI>Father,</HI> will you not be <HI>Govern'd</HI> by him?

Or will you dishonour his Religion by saying that <HI>Papists</HI> are <HI>disabled</HI> by their <HI>Religion</HI> from being <HI>sound</HI> Members of the <HI>State,</HI> when he knoweth they are not so <HI>disabled</HI> by it, and accor|dingly as Sir <HI>William Temple</HI> hath in his Excellent Observations on the <HI>Low Countries</HI> made it appear, <HI>that the Papists there are a sound part of the State?</HI></P>
<P>Remember that the words <HI>only Supreme,</HI> as apply'd to your King in the <HI>Assertory</HI> part of your <HI>Oath</HI> are not <HI>Otiosa Epitheta.</HI> You will find that our great <HI>Casuist,</HI> Bishop <HI>Sanderson</HI> in his Seventh <HI>Lecture</HI> of the <HI>Obligation</HI> of <HI>Conscience</HI> lays so much <HI>stress</HI> on those <HI>words</HI> in your <HI>Oath <HI>Only Supreme</HI> Governour,</HI> as to judge him <HI>PERIUR'D</HI> who having <HI>taken</HI> the <HI>Oath,</HI> shall assert the <HI>Figment</HI> (as he calls it) of <HI>Co-ordinate Power.

<P>It is upon the <HI>weight</HI> of reason that lyes in this <HI>Assertory</HI> part of the <HI>Oath</HI> that so many <HI>Writers</HI> of the <HI>Common</HI> Law have founded their <HI>Assertion</HI> of the <HI>King</HI>'s Power o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> <HI>Commanding</HI> the <HI>Service</HI> of all his <HI>Subjects,</HI> as <HI>essential</HI> to the keeping up the <HI>Monarchy,</HI> (or the Rule of all <HI>Estates committed to him by God,</HI> that I lately spoke of) and <HI>inseparable</HI> from it, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> <HI>alienable</HI> by any <HI>Humane</HI> Laws. It is the <HI>Supreme</HI> Power of our Princes as <HI>Governors</HI> of the Realm, that hath always entitled them to <HI>Press</HI> men for the <HI>Ser|vice</HI> of the Crown by <HI>Land</HI> or <HI>Sea,</HI> and to recall both <HI>Soldiers</HI> and <HI>Mari|ners</HI> from the Service of Foreign Princes upon emergent Occasions to serve their natural <HI>Liege</HI> Lord. And the Book writ by a Learned <HI>Common</HI> Lawyer against the <HI>Exclusion,</HI> call'd, <HI>A Letter from a Gentleman of Quality in the Country,</HI> &amp;c. and Printed <HI>A.</HI> 1679. and so deservedly extoll'd by the <HI>Iudi|cious</HI> loyal, tells you in <HI>p.</HI> 7. and 8. that <HI>If it should be enacted by Parlia|ment that No man should honour the King, or love his Parents or Children,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>such an Act would be</HI> ipso facto <HI>void, because contrary to the express Divine Command,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>The Statute of</HI> 23 H. 6. c. 8. <HI>and several other Statutes Enact, that no Man shall be Sheriff of any County above one year, and that any Patent of the King to any Person for a longer term, tho with an express Clause of</HI> Non-obstante <HI>shall be void and of none Effect, and the Patentee perpetually disabled to bear the Office. And yet notwithstanding it is Re|solv'd by all the Iudges of</HI> England, <HI>that these Acts of Parliament are void: and that the King may by</HI> Non-obstante <HI>Constitute a Sheriff for Years, Life, or Inheritance. And what is the Reason which the Iudges give of this Reso|lution? Why, because, say they, in express words, this Act of Parliament cannot bar the King of the Service of his Subject, which the immutable Law of Nature doth give to him. For Obedience and Ligeance of the Subject, (add they) is due to the Soveraign by the Law of Nature.</HI> See 2 <HI>Hen.</HI> 7. 6. v. <HI>Calvin</HI>'s Case, 14. <HI>a.</HI> in <HI>Coke</HI>'s 7th <HI>Rep.</HI></P>
<P>We know that by the <HI>Statute</HI> of 4^o. <HI>H.</HI> 4. c. 5. 'tis ordain'd, That <HI>every Sheriff of</HI> England <HI>shall abide in proper Person within his Bailywick, for the time that he shall be such Officer.</HI> But this <HI>Act</HI> hath never been con|strued to hinder the King as <HI>Supreme</HI> Governor and <HI>Ruler</HI> of <HI>all</HI> Persons in the Realm from Commanding any <HI>Sheriffs</HI> to <HI>serve</HI> him elsewhere during their Shrievalties: nor on such case to oblige the Sheriffs in Conscience to observe the Statute by such Personal residence.</P>
<P><HI>Baker</HI> in the reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>first</HI> tells us of an <HI>Information A.</HI> 1629. in the <HI>Star-chamber</HI> against <HI>Mr.</HI> Long, <HI>for that he being high Sheriff of the County of</HI> Wilts, <HI>had the Charge and Custody thereof commit|ted to him, and had taken his Oath according to the Law to abide within his Bailys-wick all the time of his Sheriff-wick, and his Trust and Employment</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="26">
<HI>requiring his personal attendance therein, did contrary thereto suffer himself to be chosen a Citizen for the City of</HI> Bath <HI>to serve in the last Parliament, and did attend at</HI> Westminster <HI>in Parliament WITHOUT HIS MAIE|STIES LICENCE, he being Sheriff at that time: and that for the fore|mention'd Offences and Breach of his Oath, and neglect of his Trust, and Con|tempt of his Majesty, the Decree was, That he should be Committed to the</HI> Tower <HI>during his Majesties Pleasure, and pay a Fine of</HI> 2000 <HI>Marks to the King.</HI> Hereby you see that his Majesties <HI>LICENCE</HI> or <HI>Dispensing</HI> with that <HI>Statute</HI> had indemnify'd him from it in the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Law;</HI> and that the <HI>potestas Superioris</HI> being necessarily imply'd in a <HI>promissory</HI> Oath, the <HI>King</HI> as <HI>supreme</HI> Governour of <HI>all</HI> Persons in his Realms, commanding or al|lowing such Officers <HI>service</HI> to the publick <HI>elsewhere,</HI> had secured him in either <HI>forum.</HI></P>
<P>The known <HI>Custom</HI> of the <HI>Speaker of the House of Commons DISABLING himself</HI> when <HI>presented</HI> to the <HI>King,</HI> but of <HI>entring</HI> on his <HI>Charge</HI> on the King's approbation and pleasure signify'd (according to that saying of <HI>Cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> me posse negem quod tu posse putes</HI>) may pass for some <HI>representation</HI> to our thoughts of <HI>Disability</HI> to serve the publick, then <HI>evaporating</HI> when the King as <HI>Governor</HI> of the <HI>Realm</HI> doth give the Subject a Call so to do. You may find this practice of the <HI>Speaker's disabling himself</HI> set down in <HI>Coke</HI> 4. <HI>Inst. c.</HI> 1. And I shall here by the way take notice that he there likewise mentions it that <HI>one of the Principal ends of Calling of Parliaments is for the redress of the Mischiefs and Grievances that dayly happen.</HI> And he had there before said, Now <HI>forasmuch as divers Laws and Statutes have been ena|cted and provided for these ends aforesaid, and that divers Mischiefs in par|ticular, and divers Grievances in general concerning the Honour and Safety of the King, the State and Defence of the Kingdom, and of the Church of</HI> England <HI>might be prevented, an excellent Law was made</HI> Anno 36. E. 3. <HI>which being applied to the said Writs of Parliament doth in few and effectual words set down the true subject of a Parliament in these words, <HI>For the maintenance of the said Articles and Statutes, and redress of divers Mischiefs and Grievances which daily happen, a Parliament shall be holden every year, as another time was Ordain'd by a Statute.</HI> Before the Conquest Parliaments were to be holden twice every year,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But accordingly as my Lord <HI>Coke</HI> there takes notice of the <HI>style</HI> of the <HI>Statute</HI> of 36. <HI>E.</HI> 3. <HI>viz. <HI>to the Honour of God, and of holy Church and quietness of the People,</HI></HI> and according to the style of the Statute of 10.

<PB N="45" REF="26">
and <HI>Quietness</HI> of the People might be disturb'd by the <HI>Annual</HI> Calling of Parliaments, according to the tenour of those Laws; our Princes as <HI>Supreme</HI> Governors of the <HI>Realm,</HI> did often <HI>dispense</HI> with their observance.</P>
<P>The <HI>Author</HI> of the <HI>Book</HI> call'd <HI>The Long Parliament Dissolv'd,</HI> Printed in the <HI>year</HI> 1676. refers to <HI>the Laws of</HI> 4^o <HI>E.</HI> 3. c. 10. and 36. <HI>E.</HI> 3. c. 14. 5. <HI>E.</HI> 3. N^o. 141. 5. <HI>E.</HI> 2. N^o.&mdash;1. <HI>R.</HI> 2. N^o. 95. <HI>as positively appointing the Meeting of a Parliament once within a year. And the People</HI> (saith he) <HI>have silently waited and born the Omission of our Princes in not so Calling Parliaments:</HI> And he further mentions how <HI>Queen</HI> Elizabeth <HI>Prorogued a Parliament for three days more then a year:</HI> and he presumes to complain of His late Majesty's <HI>Proroguing</HI> his long <HI>Parliament</HI> to above a <HI>years</HI> time as <HI>illegal,</HI> and he argues for that Parliaments being disabled from Sitting and acting afterward as a Parliament, by reason of such Prorogation as con|trary to the aforesaid Laws, and which, he saith, <HI>were declared to be in force when the triennial Act was made in</HI> 16. Caroli 1^m^i. <HI>and so likewise in the Statute for repealing that triennial Act in</HI> 16. Car. 2^o. <HI>in these words, And because by the Ancient Laws and Statutes of this Realm made in the Reign of King</HI> Edward <HI>the Third, Parliaments are to be held very often,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And how the <HI>Iudgment</HI> of the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Lords</HI> was assertive of the <HI>legality</HI> of that Parliaments not being disabled from sitting after such His late Maje|sty's <HI>Prorogation,</HI> is fresh in memory.</P>
<P>But to return from whence I digress'd, I may here take notice to you how our <HI>Princes</HI> as Supreme <HI>Governors</HI> of the <HI>Realm,</HI> and as having the <HI>Rule</HI> of <HI>all</HI> Persons <HI>committed</HI> to them by <HI>God</HI> (and to whom they stand accountable for the same) have held themselves obliged further to <HI>dispense</HI> with <HI>disability</HI> incurr'd by <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> upon a Religionary account, and which they have done to the general satisfaction of their Subjects of all Religions.</P>

<P>What do you here intend to refer to?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do here intend to refer to the <HI>Statute</HI> of 3^o <HI>Iacobi</HI> c. 5. by one Clause in which Act <HI>Convict Recusants are DISABLED from practising Physick, or bearing any Office or Charge Military,</HI> and by which Clause every Person offending, <HI>is to forfeit for every such Offence</HI> 100 l. <HI>and the one Moyety thereof to be to the King, and the other Moyety to him that will sue for the same,</HI> &amp;c. But notwithstanding the <HI>Zeal</HI> of that <HI>Prince</HI> against <HI>Popery,</HI> he out of a <HI>tender</HI> regard to the <HI>Bodies</HI> and <HI>Healths</HI> of his People, and the <HI>ennabling</HI> many learned Roman-Catholick <HI>Physicians</HI> to preserve them, did by <HI>Connivence</HI> sufficient<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">y <HI>dispense</HI> with that Law; insomuch that it may be said, that that severe <HI>disabling</HI> Law came on the Stage, but as <HI>Cato</HI> into the <HI>Theatre, only to go off again.</HI></P>
<P>And I have elsewhere mention'd it, that a <HI>Book</HI> afterward Printed in his Reign, call'd <HI>The Foot out of the Snare,</HI> sets down the <HI>Names</HI> of about <HI>Twenty five</HI> famous Roman-Catholick <HI>Physicians</HI> then <HI>Practising</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> and the places of their abodes, and whom yet (I believe) no <HI>Informer</HI> ever <HI>molested.</HI></P>
<P>And notwithstanding the <HI>disability</HI> incurr'd by that <HI>Act</HI> of Parliament, I account that an eminent Roman-Catholick <HI>Physician</HI> not long since dead, was not by any among our various <HI>Sects</HI> of <HI>Protestants</HI> in the <HI>Plot-times,</HI> envy'd the liberty of being in our <HI>Metropolis</HI> the greatest <HI>Practicioner</HI> of that noble Science. By the same <HI>Clause</HI> Roman-Catholick <HI>Lawyers</HI> are likewise <HI>disabled</HI> from Practice, and under the same Penalty; but who likewise en|joy'd the same <HI>Dispensation</HI> by <HI>Connivence</HI> with those of the other <HI>Profession,</HI> accordingly as Mr. <HI>Nye</HI> in his Book, call'd <HI>Beams of former Light</HI> observes, p. 146. viz. <HI>The Law, Physick, Merchandize,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>may be practised by a Turk, or Iew, or Papist here among us,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="27" MS="y">How severe the Laws in being are against Roman-Catholicks of the other great Profession, namely of <HI>Theology,</HI> and of the Clerical or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">er officia|ting here, you know. But you likewise know my opinion I discours'd to you of in the <HI>Conjuncture</HI> of the <HI>Plot,</HI> and <HI>Panick fears;</HI> namely, that by virtue of the Contents of the <HI>Assertory</HI> part of the <HI>Oath</HI> we are upon, even our <HI>Protestant</HI> Kings as Supreme <HI>Governors</HI> of the Realm both in Matters <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> and <HI>Civil,</HI> and as having the <HI>Rule</HI> of all Persons committed to them by God, were morally bound to see our <HI>Roman-Catholick</HI> Countrey|men, while living among us here, provided with a Competent <HI>Priest|hood,</HI> as <HI>Physicians</HI> for their <HI>Souls,</HI> and to administer the Sacraments to them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I remember you Discourse of that matter then, and how you mention'd it; that if any <HI>Turks</HI> or <HI>Iews,</HI> or any <HI>Heterodox</HI> Religionaries desired to live here without a <HI>Priesthood,</HI> the Prince as <HI>Guardian</HI> of both <HI>Tables,</HI> was obliged by his <HI>Coercive</HI> Power to make them put their own <HI>Principles</HI> in <HI>practice</HI> by their having a <HI>Competent</HI> Priesthood, and which all the <HI>Sects</HI> of the <HI>Mahumetan, Paga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">, Iewish</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> Religion own it as their <HI>Principle</HI> to have: and that as Religion was necessary to the State to make men good Subjects and ready to serve their Prince, and just Dealers, a <HI>Priesthood</HI> was necessary to Religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are not therefore to wonder at the <HI>Dispensation</HI> by <HI>Connivence</HI> so many Roman-Catholick <HI>Priests</HI> enjoy'd here in the Reig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s of former Prin|ces. And I shall some other time tell you how our Laws that <HI>DISABLE Papists</HI> from bearing Arms, were in the time of the Rebellion after <HI>A.</HI> 1640. necessarily dispens'd with by the Royal Martyr as <HI>Supreme</HI> Governor of the <HI>Realm;</HI> and that none of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> did look with <HI>an evil eye</HI> in the least on such <HI>disability,</HI> being then <HI>dispens'd</HI> with by <HI>Prerogative.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose you may have heard it <HI>objected</HI> that by the <HI>Statute</HI> of 25. <HI>C.</HI> 2. which has lately employ'd your thoughts, the <HI>Prerogative</HI> of the King is not touch'd; for that the <HI>King</HI> may grant the <HI>Offices</HI> to any of his <HI>Subjects,</HI> and that the <HI>Act</HI> is only a <HI>Direction</HI> to the <HI>Subject</HI> to <HI>qualifie</HI> him|self accordingly for the King's <HI>Service,</HI> and that if he be <HI>uncapable</HI> to serve the <HI>King,</HI> 'tis through his own <HI>default,</HI> and he is punishable for the same, as happen'd in the <HI>Case</HI> of one who was made <HI>Sheriff</HI> and neglected to take the <HI>Oaths:</HI> and that there was an Opinion given in the Case that no <HI>Sub|ject</HI> could put himself out of a <HI>Capacity</HI> to <HI>serve</HI> the King, but for so doing he is <HI>punishable.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the more you think of this Matter, you will find the <HI>unreasona|bleness</HI> of the <HI>Objection</HI> recurring upon your thoughts with greater force. For it is not in mens Power to <HI>qualifie</HI> themselves to <HI>serve</HI> the <HI>King</HI> by <HI>be|lieving</HI> what <HI>doctrinal</HI> Propositions they will: and tho you have heard of a <HI>Faith</HI> that will remove <HI>Mountains,</HI> yet you may consider that 'tis as easie to <HI>remove</HI> them as your <HI>Faith</HI> it self about Matters of <HI>reveal'd</HI> truth, and that considering the Circumstances some mens Minds are involv'd in, they can no more alter their beliefs about <HI>Transubstantiation,</HI> then they can <HI>transubstantiate</HI> themselves into other Creatures; and are under a <HI>Mo|ral</HI> incapacity of preventing another incurred by <HI>Law.</HI> And therefore as it would be Injustice in a Judge to <HI>Punish</HI> a man for the Errors of the mind that he knoweth not to be <HI>voluntary,</HI> and for a man's not putting himself into a <HI>Capacity</HI> to <HI>serve</HI> the <HI>King,</HI> by the <HI>Professing</HI> of the truth in <HI>Proble|matical</HI> Points, when the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Kings</HI> hath by the not <HI>sufficient</HI> promul|gating of such truth to his understanding, render'd him <HI>innocent</HI> in his <HI>disbelief</HI> thereof, and so long morally <HI>uncapable</HI> to profess it; so by one

man's after another appearing thus <HI>unable</HI> to <HI>qualifie</HI> himself to <HI>serve</HI> the <HI>King,</HI> he may be <HI>totally</HI> unserved.</P>
<P>I have often heard you complain of the narrow <HI>Idea</HI>'s of the King's <HI>Su|premacy</HI> in some of the <HI>Non-Conformists:</HI> but if you will read the <HI>Protesta|tion of the King's Supremacy</HI> made by the <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">n-conforming</HI> Ministers and Printed <HI>A&punc; D.</HI> 1605. you will find that they have there given in sufficient caution for t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">eir Principles, not allowing any of the King's Subjects being <HI>disabled</HI> from serving him. For they having said in &sect;. 1. <HI>We hold and maintain the same Authority and Suprem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">cy in all Causes and over all Per|sons Civil and Ecclesiastical granted by</HI> Statute <HI>to Queen</HI> Elizabeth, <HI>and ex|pressed and declared in the Book of</HI> Advertisements and Injunctions, and <HI>in Mr.</HI> Bilson <HI>against the Iesuites, to be due in full and ample manner without any limitation or qualification to the King&punc; and his Heirs and Successors for ever,</HI> they add in &sect;. 2. <HI>We are so far from judging the said Sup<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">emacy to be unlawful, that we are pers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> aded that the King should sin highly against God, if he should not assume the same to himself, and that the Churches within his Dominions should sin damnably, if they should deny to yield the same to him; yea, tho the STATUTES of the Kingdom should de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">y it to him.</HI> And they tell you in <HI>Sect.</HI> 6. that <HI>the height of the King's Royal Dignity con|sists in his Supremacy.</HI></P>
<P>It is thus likewise a kind of familiar or <HI>Vulgar</HI> Error among <HI>Protestants</HI> to think that in the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ncient</HI> times this Fundamental <HI>Assertory</HI> part of your Oath t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">at <HI>the King is the only Supreme Governor of this R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">alm,</HI> was not al|low'd.

<P>But that he might <HI>perimere litem,</HI> as to the point of the ancientness of the King's <HI>Supremacy,</HI> he there referreth to the <HI>judgment</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> decla|red in the <HI>Statute</HI> of 24^o. <HI>H.</HI> 8. c. 12. viz. <HI>That by divers authentick Hi|stories and Chronicles, it is manifestly declared and expressed, that this Realm of</HI> England <HI>is an Empire, and so hath been accepted in the World govern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">d by one Supreme Head and King,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>unto whom a Body-Poli|tick, compact of all sorts and degrees of People divided in terms and by names of Spiritualty and Temporalty been bounden and owen to beat next unto God, a natural and humble Obedience,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>I cannot help it; but if you will have me speak with the <HI>frankness</HI> of a <HI>Philosopher,</HI> concerning the <HI>Nature</HI> of things, the <HI>disabling</HI> of the <HI>Subjects</HI> must have that effect in <HI>Nature,</HI> and of the <HI>disabling</HI> of their <HI>Country</HI> too. And I think too you gave me a <HI>hint</HI> for some such thought at our last meet|ing. If you do but consider the Services done to Monarchs by that abject Nation of the <HI>Iews</HI> (and who by <HI>Tacitus</HI> were call'd the <HI>Vilissima pars ser|vientium</HI>) and how in our <HI>Saviour</HI>'s time they were serviceable to the <HI>Ro|man</HI> Empire in the Collection of the <HI>Customs,</HI> and how much they have been since and still are useful to the Grand <HI>Signior,</HI> and to many Christian Princes by gathering in their <HI>Imposts,</HI> you will easily imagine the loss that would redound to Princes by Religionary <HI>Heterodoxy</HI> disabling any to serve them.</P>
<P>It is but natural to men of the most <HI>inquisitive</HI> and penetrating thoughts to differ from many Points of <HI>Theology</HI> receiv'd by Princes and their People: and since such <HI>heterodoxy</HI> doth <HI>difficult</HI> their access to Preferment, it is but Natural to them by their working Thoughts and Industry to arrive at the excelling the duller <HI>Orthodox</HI> in whatever course of life they take, and by that means to try to <HI>push</HI> on their way into their <HI>Prince</HI>'s favour, and conse|quently to have very sharp <HI>regrets</HI> against any Methods that would <HI>inca|pacitate</HI> them for it.</P>
<P>And as if this <HI>Civil</HI> Death were to Men of great Thoughts the <HI>terrible</HI> of <HI>terribles,</HI> and what as hindring them from serving their Prince and Country were like Burying them alive, I shall shew you how a Man of great Abilities, and who had made a great Figure in the Church and State, resen|ted it in the <HI>Conjuncture</HI> of A. 1640. I mean Archbishop <HI>Williams,</HI> who in his famous <HI>Speech</HI> in <HI>Parliament</HI> that year against the <HI>Bill</HI> that afterward passed into a <HI>Law</HI> to <HI>Disable</HI> Persons in <HI>Holy</HI> Orders from exercising any <HI>Temporal</HI> Jurisdiction, doth thereupon represent it, that <HI>under a</HI> CAIN'<HI>s mark an eternal kind of disability or incapacity is laid on them from enjoying hereafter any of those Rights, Favours, or Charters of for|mer Princes, and which is the heaviest Point of all without killing of</HI> Abel, <HI>or any Crime laid to their charge, more then that in the beginning of the Bill 'tis said roundly, and in the style of</HI> Lacedaemon, <HI>that they ought not to inter|meddle,</HI> &amp;c. And what his thoughts were of the Injustice of such <HI>incapacity</HI> put on the <HI>Clergy,</HI> and of the <HI>odiousness</HI> of that <HI>Punishment</HI> of <HI>incapacity,</HI> ap|pears by what he afterward saith, <HI>viz. I come to the 4th part of this Bill, which is the manner of the inhibition every way heavy in the Penalty, heavier a great deal in the incapacity. In the weighing the Penalty, will you consider the small wyers; that is, poor Causes that are to induce the same; and then the heavy load that hangs upon these wyers? It is thus. If a Natural Subject of</HI> England, <HI>interessed in the</HI> Magna Charta and Petition of Right, <HI>as well as any other; yet being a Person in Holy Orders shall happen unfortunately to Vote in Parliament, to obey his Prince by way of Councel, or by way of a Com|missioner be required thereunto, then is he presently to lose and forfeit for his first offence all his Means and Livelyhood,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>This Peradventure may move others most, but it doth not me. It is not the Penalty, but the Incapacity,</HI>
<PB N="49" REF="28">
<HI>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">d as the Philosophers would call it, the Natural impotency imposed by this Bill on men in holy Orders to SERVE the KING, or the STATE in this kind, be they otherwise never so able, or never so willing, or never so vertuous, which makes me draw a kind of</HI> Timanthe'<HI>s veil over this Point, and leave it without any amplification at all to your Lordships wise and inward Thoughts and Considerations.</HI></P>
<P>But if with so much <HI>thunder</HI> of Passion as well as <HI>lightning</HI> of reason that learned <HI>Speech</HI> from the <HI>Bishops</HI> Bench did so much <HI>resent</HI> the punishing the <HI>Clergy</HI> with <HI>disability</HI> to execute <HI>secular</HI> Offices, and to have the ho|nour of <HI>serving</HI> their <HI>Prince</HI> and <HI>Country</HI> therein, and for the imposing of which <HI>disability</HI> that known place of <HI>Scripture,</HI> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 4. <HI>No man that wars, entangles himself with the Affairs of this life,</HI> was <HI>alledged</HI> in the <HI>House</HI> as thus <HI>disabling</HI> them by the <HI>Law</HI> Divine (and as to which the <HI>Bishop</HI> in his <HI>Speech</HI> gives a learned Answer) we may well imagine how <HI>Lay-men</HI> of good Births and Educations, and whose Diligence employ'd in Courts and Cities, and Camps abroad, may have qualify'd them here to <HI>stand before Kings,</HI> must necessarily aggravate in their thoughts the dis|honour of <HI>incapacity</HI> to <HI>serve</HI> their <HI>Prince</HI> in <HI>secular</HI> Employments.</P>

<P>You will find it in the <HI>Apology for the Bishops to sit and Vote in Par|liament,</HI> printed in <HI>London A.</HI> 1661. And he hath in that <HI>Speech</HI> some o|ther Expressions which corroborate that obvious natural notion of the <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Kingdom</HI> being <HI>disabled</HI> by disabling of Clergy-men from <HI>secular</HI> Em|ployments. For having reflected on the <HI>Bill</HI> for <HI>disabling</HI> them from sit|ting in the <HI>Star-chamber</HI> and at the <HI>Council-table,</HI> sitting in <HI>Commissions</HI> of the <HI>Peace,</HI> and other Comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ssions of <HI>secular</HI> Affairs, he afterward saith, <HI>But, my noble Lords, this is the Case; Our King hath by the</HI> Statute <HI>restored to him the Headship of the Church of</HI> England. <HI>And by the word of God he is</HI> custos utriusque tabulae. <HI>And will your Lordships allow this ecclesiastical Head no ecclesiastical Senses?

<P>The truth is, it being a kind of a <HI>Rule</HI> that all Men of Parts who have been <HI>liberally</HI> educated, and even those excelling in <HI>mechanical</HI> pro|fessions, do naturally desire to <HI>serve</HI> the <HI>King,</HI> and <HI>standing before Kings</HI> having been <HI>annext</HI> in <HI>Scripture</HI> as a reward to <HI>diligence</HI> in ones calling; a <HI>Mark</HI> of <HI>disability</HI> put on <HI>Lay-men</HI> to serve their Prince, cannot but tempt them to <HI>passion</HI> on that account more then it ought to have troub|led the <HI>Bishop</HI> when he call'd it a <HI>Cai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s Mark,</HI> in regard you have mention'd it, that Clergy-men to some did seem by the Law-Divine <HI>disabled</HI> from <HI>secular</HI> Employments.</P>

<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>According to the Opinion of <HI>Iudge Vaughan</HI> in his <HI>Reports,</HI> who in <HI>Hill</HI> and <HI>Good's Case</HI> there makes <HI>a lawful Canon to be the Law of the King|dom as well as an Act of Parliament, and whatever is the Law, is as much the Law as any thing else that is so, for what is Law, doth not suscipere magis aut minus,</HI> they were by the <HI>Canon</HI> Law disabled from intermedling in <HI>se|cular</HI> Affairs: And according to his <HI>description</HI> of <HI>malum prohibitum</HI> in <HI>Tho|mas &amp; Sorre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s case</HI> p. 358. you may say they were by the <HI>Statute</HI> so <HI>disabled</HI> from intermedling. For he there saith <HI>malum prohibitum is that which is prohibited per le statute. Per le statute is not intended only an Act of Par|liament, but any obliging Law or Constitution, as appears by the Case: for it is said the King may dispense with a Bastard to take Holy Orders, or with&punc;</HI>
<PB N="50" REF="29">
<HI>a Clerk to have two Benefices with Cure, which were</HI> mala prohibita <HI>by the Canon-Law, and by the Council of</HI> Lateran, <HI>not by Act of Parliament.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Lateran</HI> Council his Lordship there means, is that held under <HI>Alex|ander</HI> the <HI>3d A.</HI> 1180, and which <HI>Council</HI> hath it in these words, <HI>viz. neque servi neque spurii sunt ordinandi:</HI> And, <HI>uni plura ecclesiastica beneficia non sunt committenda.</HI></P>
<P>And therefore the <HI>Bishop</HI> in that <HI>Speech</HI> saith, That <HI>this Doctrine of de|barring Persons in Holy Orders from secular Employments, is the Doctrine of the Popish Church, and first brought into this Kingdom by the Pop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s of</HI> Rome <HI>and</HI> Lanfrank, Anselm, Stephen Langthon, <HI>and</HI> Othobone <HI>and with an intent to withdraw the Clergy from t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">eir receiving Obligations from either King or Lords, and make them wholly dependants on the Popacy.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>Bishop Iewel</HI> tells us in his <HI>Apology</HI> p. 122. that <HI>Veteres Canones Apostolorum illum Episcopum, qui simul &amp; Civilem magistratum, &amp; ecclesi|asticam functionem obire velit, jubent ab officio summoveri.</HI></P>

<P>Yet notwithstanding their being disabled by the antient <HI>Canons,</HI> and the <HI>Nemo militans,</HI> &amp;c. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. as often alledged against them by the <HI>Canons</HI> and <HI>Canonists,</HI> I think they were frequently <HI>employ'd</HI> by our <HI>Princes</HI> in the greatest <HI>Offices</HI> of the <HI>State.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>They were so, and the <HI>Disability</HI> of a whole <HI>third</HI> estate as to bearing <HI>secular</HI> Offices did not stand in the way of <HI>Prerogative.</HI> I have read it in <HI>Fuller</HI>'s <HI>Church-History</HI> that in the <HI>year</HI> 1350. <HI>the Lords and Commons in Parliament did find themselves aggrieved that the Clergy-men engrossed all secular Offices, and thereupon presented the ensuing Petition to the King ac|cording to this effect, insisting only in the substance thereof,</HI> viz.</P>
<P><HI>And because that in this present Parliament it was</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1370. <HI>Ex Rot. Parl. in turr.

<P><HI>To this Petition the King return'd that he would ordain upon this point, as it should best seem to him by the advice of his good Council.</HI></P>
<P>In fine, you see that tho the Clergy-men were thus <HI>disabled</HI> by the <HI>ge|neral</HI> Customs and <HI>Usage</HI> of the Realm, and by <HI>lawful</HI> Canons and <HI>provincial</HI> Constitutions, accounted by that <HI>Iudge</HI> beforemention'd to be <HI>tanta-mount</HI> to <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Parliament:</HI> yet you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ee our Kings did frequently <HI>dispense</HI> with these Customs, lawful <HI>Canons</HI> and <HI>Constitutions.</HI> And tho the <HI>Office</HI> of <HI>Bishops</HI> renders them <HI>guardians</HI> of the <HI>Canons,</HI> yet you see how tender they have been of the <HI>Regal</HI> power of <HI>Dispensing</HI> therein.</P>
<P>And as that saying of <HI>Wicliffe,</HI> however censured in the <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Con|stance,</HI> may perhaps with a little help be reduced to Orthodoxy, <HI>viz. That <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ne should be Excommunicated by any Prelate, unless he know him Excom|municated</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="29">
<HI>by God,</HI> so with parity of reason it may be said, that none should be totally <HI>disabled</HI> by any Prince from serving him, unless he knew him really <HI>disabled</HI> by <HI>God;</HI> and especially when he knew the contrary, and that the Services of the great men of the <HI>Clergy</HI> had so often been success|fully employ'd at the Helm of <HI>State:</HI> and when for the honour of <HI>Clergy|mens</HI> Councel some of the most profound pieces of State-Policy our <HI>English</HI> Story hath in it are to be attributed to <HI>Clergy-mens</HI> officiating in their Princes <HI>Councels,</HI> and as for Example, when by the figure that Bishop <HI>Mor|ton</HI> made at the Helm, he did make up the dismal breach, and united the two Houses of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lancaster</HI> in the Happy Marriage between <HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>7th</HI> and the Lady <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> when Bishop <HI>Fox</HI> who was Lord Privy Seal, did by his Advice lay the Foundation of a more happy Union between the Kingdoms of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> by the eldest Daughter of <HI>Hen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">y</HI> marrying <HI>Iames</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the younger matching into <HI>France,</HI> that so on their ever coming to inherit, <HI>Scotland</HI> might be <HI>annex'd</HI> to the Impe|rial Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>England</HI> not be annex'd as a <HI>Province</HI> to <HI>France,</HI> and for the <HI>Consequences</HI> of which <HI>Advice,</HI> both <HI>Englishmen,</HI> and <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Protestants have so much cause to say, <HI>We Praise thee, O God,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And I am here minded of what <HI>Fuller</HI> tells us on <HI>A.</HI> 14. <HI>H.</HI> 4. viz. <HI>It was moved in Parliament that no Weishman, Bishop or other, shall be Iustice, Chamberlain, Chancellor, Treasurer, Sheriff, Constable of a a Castle, or Keeper of Records, or Lieutenant in the said Office in any part of Wales, or of Councel to any English Lord, notwithstanding any Patent made to the contrary,</HI> Cum clausul&acirc; non obstante licet Wallicus natus: <HI>and that it was answered, that the King willeth it, except the Bishops: and for them and others which he hath found good loyal Lieges toward him, out said Lord the King will be advised by the Advice of his Councel. <HI>Ex Rot.

<P>There passed an <HI>Act</HI> of Parliament in the <HI>4th</HI> year of <HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>4th,</HI> by which it is Enacted, That no <HI>Welshman shall be Iustice, Chamberlain. Sheriff, Coroner, nor other Officer in any part of</HI> Wales, <HI>notwithstanding any Patent to the contrary with the Clause of</HI> Non-obstante: and yet <HI>without Question</HI> (saith my Lord <HI>Coke,</HI> 12th Rep.) <HI>the King might dispense with this Statute:</HI> but you see how on the Parliaments resenting the Dispensations the Act had met with, and particularly in Bishops having contrary to the tenor of the <HI>Act</HI> served the Crown in Secular Employments, the King particularly ad|hered to the exercise of his <HI>Dispensative</HI> Power in their Case.</P>
<P>It was upon the ground of this <HI>Assertion,</HI> viz. Of the <HI>Crown</HI>'s being en|titled to Command the <HI>Services</HI> of all <HI>Subjects,</HI> that some Papists were em|ploy'd by Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> in Affairs of the State, notwithstanding any disability incurr'd by not taking the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Supremacy.</HI> And Viscount <HI>Montacute,</HI> tho a <HI>Roman Catholick,</HI> was (as <HI>Cambden</HI> tells you) sent by her as her Embassadour to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and employ'd too about the Business of the <HI>Scots,</HI> and to do right to the <HI>Protestant</HI> Religion.

<P>And as to the <HI>sense</HI> of many of that <HI>Queen</HI>'s most renowned <HI>Ministers</HI> of <HI>State</HI> about the <HI>Deprivation</HI> of the <HI>Nonconformist</HI> Divines disabled <HI>eo No|mine</HI> from their Ministry, being <HI>Penal</HI> to the <HI>People,</HI> the <HI>Author</HI> of <HI>certain Considerations tending to promote peace and good will among Protestants,</HI> hath mention'd it, that <HI>Eight</HI> of that <HI>Queens Privy Councellors</HI> writ a <HI>Letter</HI> in

Consider what the <HI>Prefatory</HI> part, as the <HI>key</HI> of it mentions, <HI>viz. <HI>That divers good Laws and Statutes that were made</HI></HI> in Henry <HI>the Eighth's time as well for the utter extinguishment and putting away of all Usur|ped and Foreign Power,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>as also for the restoring and uniting to the Imperial Crown of this Realm, the ancient Iurisdictions,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>to the same of Right belonging, by reason whereof we your most humble and obedient Subjects from the 25th year of the Reign of your said dear Father were continually kept in good order, and were disburden'd of divers great and intolerable Charges and Exactions before that time un|lawfully taken and exacted by such Foreign Power and Authority as before that was usurped, until such time as all the said good Laws and Statutes by one Act of Parliament made in the first and second years of the Reigns of the late King</HI> Philip <HI>and Queen</HI> Mary, <HI>&amp;c. <HI>were repeai'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">:</HI></HI> by reason whereof they then further mention how they <HI>were then brought under an Usurped Foreign Authority to their intolerable Charges,</HI> and they thereupon desire the <HI>Repealing</HI> of that <HI>Act.</HI> Here we are given to see by their <HI>dating</HI> the <HI>aera</HI> of their being well <HI>govern'd</HI> and <HI>disburthen'd</HI> of divers great <HI>intolerable</HI> Charges and <HI>Exactions</HI> taken and exacted by Fo|reign Power, from the <HI>25th</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>8th,</HI> and had their eye on the <HI>Statute</HI> of the 25th of <HI>Henry</HI> the 8th, <HI>c.</HI> 21. entituled, <HI>No Imposition shall be paid to the Bishop of</HI> Rome, which sets forth how <HI>the Subjects of this Realm were impoverish'd by intolerable Exactions of great Sums of Money taken out of this Realm by the Bishop of</HI> Rome <HI>as well in Pen|sions, Censes, Suits for Provisions and Expeditions of Bulls,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and also for Dispensations, Licences, Faculties, Grants, Relaxations, Writs call'd</HI> Perinde valere, <HI>Rehabilitations, Abolitions, and other infi|nite sorts of Bulls, Breves and Instruments of sundry Natures,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>wherein the Bishop of</HI> Rome <HI>hath been not only to be blamed for his Usur|pation in the Premisses, but also for his abusing and beguiling your Sub|jects, pretending and persuading them that he hath Power to Dispense with all Humane Laws, Uses and Customs of all Realms in all Causes which be call'd Spiritual, which matter hath been usurped and practised by him and his Predecessors by many years, in great de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">gation of your Imperial Crown and Authority Royal, contrary to Right and Consci|ence.

<HI>God, but only your Grace, hath been and is free from Subjection to any mans Laws, but only to such as have been devised, made and ob|tained within this Realm for the Wealth of the same, or to such other as by SUFFERANCE of your GRACE and your Progenitors, the People of this your Realm have taken at their free liberty by their own Consent to be used among them, and have bound themselves by long Use and Custom to the observance of the same, not as to the observance of the Laws of any Foreign Prince, Potentate or Prelate, but as to the Customes and ancient Laws of this Realm, originally establish d Laws of the same by the same Sufferance, Consents, and Custom, and none otherwise; it standeth therefore with natural equity and good reason, that in all and every such Laws HUMANE made within this Realm, or induced into this Realm by the said Sufferance, Consents and Cu|stom, your Royal Majesty and your Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>have full Power and Authority not only to dispense but also to authorize some elect Person or Persons to dispense with those and all other humane Laws of this your Realm, and with every one of them, as the quality of the Persons and Matter shall require.</HI> And the <HI>Act</HI> after|ward mentions the <HI>impoverishment</HI> of the <HI>People</HI> of this Realm by the <HI>Im|posts</HI> for Papal <HI>Dispensations,</HI> and refers twice to the Charges of the <HI>taxa Camerae,</HI> calling them <HI>expresly</HI> in one place, <HI>Impositions taken to the use of the Pope and his Chambers;</HI> and in another, the <HI>old Tax.</HI> And at the <HI>removal</HI> of these <HI>intolerable Charges,</HI> as they are call'd in that of the <HI>Statute</HI> of 1^o <HI>Eliz.</HI> or <HI>intolerable Exactions,</HI> as they are call'd in the 25th of <HI>Henry</HI> the 8th; that of the <HI>First</HI> of <HI>Elizabeth</HI> (as I said) had an <HI>eye</HI> in the revival of this of <HI>Henry</HI> the 8th; and the Consideration of which <HI>Statute</HI> will be of im|portance to us as to that part of our <HI>Promissory</HI> Oath that refers to our <HI>de|fending</HI> the <HI>Iurisdictions,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>united and annex'd to the Imperial Crown of this Realm;</HI> that <HI>Statute</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the 8th having in its <HI>Prefatory</HI> part ex|press'd the Pope's <HI>dispensing</HI> here to be in <HI>derogation</HI> of the King's <HI>Imperial</HI> Crown and Authority <HI>Royal,</HI> and there afterwards mentions how the <HI>Im|perial</HI> Crown of this <HI>Realm</HI> suffer'd by those Papal <HI>Exactions.</HI> And the <HI>Pre|face</HI> of the <HI>Statute</HI> of 1^o <HI>Eliz.</HI> refers in general to <HI>divers good Statutes</HI> made in <HI>Henry</HI> the 8th's time, for the <HI>Restoring and uniting&punc; to the Imperial Crown of this Realm the Iurisdictions, Authorities to the same of Right belonging&punc;</HI> and which <HI>ushers</HI> in the <HI>reference</HI> to the <HI>Statute</HI> of the 25th of <HI>Henry</HI> the 8th: and then in the following Clause 'tis said, <HI>that for the repressing of the usurped Foreign Power, and the restoring the Rights, Iurisdictions and Preheminences belonging to the Imperial Crown of this Realm,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Thus then you see that I have fairly shew'd you out of this <HI>Statute</HI> of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> where your <HI>Oath</HI> is <HI>situated,</HI> that the <HI>Restoration</HI> of the <HI>Ancient</HI> Jurisdiction of the <HI>Crown</HI> in <HI>dispensing,</HI> was restored to the <HI>Impe|rial</HI> Crown of this Realm, the which the <HI>Pope</HI> had formerly usurped on in Matters both Ecclesiastical and Civil, and which you are obliged to <HI>de|fend</HI> against any <HI>Papal</HI> or <HI>Popular</HI> Usurpations whatsoever. I was enforced for your clearer understanding of this <HI>Statute</HI> to conduct you to the 25th of <HI>Henry</HI> the 8th, and where you find several <HI>Expressions</HI> that make it the right of the <HI>Imperial</HI> Crown of this Realm to <HI>dispense</HI> with the <HI>disability</HI> or <HI>incapacity</HI> incurr'd by <HI>Law.</HI> You have there the word <HI>REHABILITA|TION,</HI> and what is called there the <HI>Writ</HI> of <HI>Perinde valere,</HI> which <HI>Blount</HI> tells you in his <GAP DESC="foreign"> is a <HI>Dispensation granted to a Clerk, who being defective in his title to a Benefice, or other Ecclefiastical Function is</HI> de facto <HI>admitted to it.

<P>You have in your <HI>Oath</HI> acknowledg'd the <HI>Crown</HI> of this Realm to be a Crown <HI>Imperial,</HI> and if you had not by the <HI>Comparing</HI> the two <HI>Statutes</HI> to|gether, found that the Power of <HI>Rehabilitation</HI> of Persons disabled was re|stored and united to the Crown, as what was <HI>anciently</HI> due to it, and <HI>used</HI> by it; yet on the Consideration of the <HI>Crown</HI> here being call'd <HI>Imperial,</HI> and of its being a <HI>res judicata</HI> among all that write of the <HI>Power</HI> of such <HI>Crowns</HI> that a <HI>Dispensation</HI> with Persons in this <HI>kind,</HI> is allow'd them as one of the <HI>jura Majestatis,</HI> you ought by virtue of your <HI>Oath</HI> to be very careful how you deny this <HI>mark</HI> of <HI>Soveraignty</HI> to the <HI>Imperial</HI> Crown of this Realm which you see wants <HI>none</HI> of the other.</P>
<P>I think I have now let you see that I have here put no <HI>forced</HI> or <HI>wyre|drawn</HI> Consequences on you, and would hate to do any thing of that Nature in common Discourse, and about a common or trivial matter, and much more in the <HI>concern</HI> of an <HI>Oath.</HI> You know I have often prais'd that <HI>Letter</HI> in <HI>D'Ossal</HI> where he reflects on some Men thus, viz. <HI>Le sont gens d'esprit, de scavoir &amp; de labeur, qui <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ont forg&egrave;, mais de fort ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">vaise foy, ne fai~sans Con|science, &amp; n' ayans honte de traitter un cas de Conscience, &amp; si important a la Religion Catholique &amp; a toute la Chrestiente, en chichaneurs &amp; sophistes.</HI></P>
<P>But further yet to let you see that in minding you in point of <HI>Conscience,</HI> and by <HI>virtue</HI> of this your <HI>Oath;</HI> duly to prop up the Regal Power of <HI>Dis|pensing</HI> with <HI>Incapacity,</HI> I put no <HI>wyre-drawn</HI> Consequences upon you, and do with the <HI>simplicity</HI> that becomes a <HI>Christian</HI> speak to you <HI>ex animo,</HI> I shall again give you the <HI>Iudgment</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> in the <HI>Case,</HI> and to that end shall first direct you to the <HI>Statute</HI> of 37^o. <HI>H.</HI> 8. <HI>c.</HI> 17. that begins, <HI>In most humble wise shew and declare to your Highness your most faith|ful, humble and obedient Subjects, that where your most Royal Majesty is and hath always justly been by THE WORD OF God, supreme head in the Earth of the Church of</HI> England, <HI>and hath full Power and Authority to correct, punish, and repress all manner of Heresies, Errors, Uices,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and to exercise all other manner of Iurisdictions commonly call'd Ecclesiastical Iurisdiction, nevertheless the Bishop of</HI> Rome <HI>and his adherents minding utterly as much as in him lay to abolish, obscure, and delete such Power given by God to the Princes of the Earth, whereby they might gather, and get to themselves the Government and Rule of the World, have in their Councils and Synods Provincial made divers Ordinances and Constitutions that no LAY or Married man should or might exercise any Iurisdiction Ecclesiastical, nor should be any Iudge or Register in any Court commonly call'd Ecclesiastical Court,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>as by the said Councils and Constitutions Provincial appeareth, which standing and remaining in their effect not abolish'd by your Grace's Laws, did sound to appear to make greatly for the said usurp'd Power of the Bishop of</HI> Rome, <HI>and to be directly repugnant to your Majesty as Supreme Head of the Church, and Prerogative royal, your GRACE being a LAY-MAN, and albeit the said Decrees, Ordinances and Constitutions by a Statute made in the</HI> 25th <HI>year of your Reign be utterly abolish'd,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>But forasmuch as your Majesty is the only and undoubted Supreme Head of the Church of</HI> England, <HI>and also of</HI> Ireland, <HI>to whom BY HOLY SCRIPTURE all Authority and Power is wholly given to hear and determine all manner of Causes Ecclesiastical, and to correct Uice and Sin whatsoever.</HI> and <HI>TO ALL SUCH PERSONS AS YOUR MA|IESTY SHALL APPOINT THEREUNED, that in Conside|ration thereof, as well for the Instruction of Ignorant Persons,</HI> &amp;c.

<HI>and setting forth of your Prerogative Royal and Supremacy: It may therefore please your Highness, that it may be Ordain'd and Enacted, that all and singular Persons as well LAY as those that be now Mar|ried or hereafter shall be Married,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>which shall be made, ordain'd, constituted and deputed to be any Chancellor, Uicar General,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Scribe or Register by your Majesty, or any of your Heirs and Successors, or by any Archbishop, Bishop,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>may lawfully execute and execute all man|ner of Iurisdiction commonly call'd Ecclesiastical,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Here you see the <HI>enacting</HI> clause founded on the <HI>previous</HI> solemn <HI>ac|knowledgment</HI> of the King's <HI>supremacy,</HI> and on his having the <HI>power</HI> given him, not by <HI>Parliaments</HI> or <HI>People,</HI> but <HI>by SCRIPTURE,</HI> to <HI>appoint</HI> such to be <HI>ecclesiastical</HI> Judges who were by Custom and by the <HI>Laws</HI> of <HI>Councils</HI> and <HI>Provincial</HI> Synods formerly equivalent to <HI>Acts</HI> of Parliament, <HI>incapaci|tated</HI> so to be. And from whence it is consequently apparent that no po|sitive <HI>humane</HI> Laws whatsoever inflictive of Penal <HI>incapacity</HI> could against the Right inherent in him by the positive <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> oblige him not to <HI>dispense</HI> with the others by his <HI>supreme</HI> Power when he found it necessary so to do. For 'tis on all hands <HI>confessedly</HI> true, that <HI>Parliaments</HI> can no more then the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Rome delete such Power as is given by God to the Princes of the Earth.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>But because a <HI>Parliament</HI> declared that such a supreme Power is gi|ven by the <HI>Scripture</HI> to Princes, you know it doth not follow that it is so. And moreover you know that was a <HI>Popish</HI> Parliament that so declared it.</P>

<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I likewise know that as 'tis in my <HI>Lord Chief Iustice</HI> Vaughan'<HI>s Reports</HI> in Hill <HI>and</HI> Good'<HI>s Case,</HI> that <HI>if a Marriage be declared by Act of Parliament to be against Gods Law, we must admit it to be so, for by a Law, that is, an Act of Parliament it is so declared;</HI> so that <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> having <HI>declared</HI> it, that <HI>by Holy Scripture all Authority and Power is whol|ly given to the King, and to all such Persons as he shall appoint to hear and determine,</HI> &amp;c. tho such Persons were by a <HI>lawful</HI> Canon <HI>incapacitated</HI> so to do (a <HI>Canon</HI> that that <HI>Iudge</HI> in the words immediately following the o|ther makes to be <HI>the Law of the Kingdom as well as an Act of Parliament</HI>) we must admit such <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Authority</HI> inherent in the King's <HI>Supremacy</HI> by the <HI>Word</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> thus to supersede <HI>incapacity.</HI> And whether the <HI>inca|pacitating</HI> Canons were <HI>lawful</HI> ones or no, it is not <HI>tanti</HI> to enquire, since as we know a <HI>Power</HI> inherent in <HI>Kings</HI> by the <HI>Word</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> cannot be ei|ther by lawful <HI>Canon</HI> or <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> taken away: and much more ought such <HI>Power</HI> to be <HI>construed</HI> and <HI>admitted</HI> as <HI>inherent</HI> in him <HI>by the Scripture,</HI> while the <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> continues in being.</P>

<P>You have mention'd one thing in that <HI>Statute</HI> of <HI>Harry</HI> the <HI>8th</HI> that doth a little startle me: and that is that <HI>he</HI> and the <HI>three</HI> Estates ap|ply'd there the <HI>design</HI> of keeping up those <HI>Canons</HI> of <HI>Councils</HI> and provincial <HI>Constitutions</HI> that incapacitated <HI>LAYMEN,</HI> as <HI>level'd</HI> at the exclusion of the <HI>King</HI> himself, not only from his <HI>Prerogative,</HI> but from being in a <HI>ca|pacity</HI> to exercise <HI>ecclesiastical</HI> Jurisdiction as <HI>supreme</HI> head of the <HI>Church,</HI> as I find by those remarkable words, YOUR GRACE BEING A LAY-MAN.</P>

<P>You do well to take <HI>notice</HI> of that, and are therefore not to wonder at it if you should hear your Prince who was a <HI>Dissenter</HI> to the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> and others concern'd for him, to have apprehensions of what pre|judice might be meant him by some subtle Projectors of Laws, to <HI>incapaci|tate</HI> all <HI>Papists</HI> and <HI>Presbyterians</HI> from acting in any <HI>Office</HI> in <HI>Church</HI> or <HI>State,</HI> however many loyal Persons might be far from <HI>intending</HI> such pre|judice thereby: <HI>his Grace</HI> being a <HI>Papist,</HI> or <HI>Presbyterian.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess that if the <HI>Kings</HI> Power of <HI>commanding</HI> the <HI>Services</HI> of <HI>all</HI> his Subjects be inherent in him by the <HI>Word</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> and as such <HI>de|clared</HI> by Parliament, any Mens <HI>endeavours</HI> to take away that Power, may well be <HI>imputed</HI> to great incogitancy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>You say right: and I was hence induced to wonder, that after <HI>the Act and Acknowledgment of his Majesty's Prerogative in the Choice of his Officers of State-Councellors and Iudges</HI> had thus passed in the <HI>first Parlia|ment</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> in the late King's reign, <HI>viz. <HI>The Estates of Parliament considering the great Obligations that lie upon them from the Law of God, the Law of Nations, the Municipal Laws of the Land, and their Oathes of Allegiance to maintain and defend the Soveraign Power and Authority of the King's Majesty, and the sad Consequences that do ac|company an encrochment upon or diminution thereof, do therefore from their sense of humble duty declare, that it is an inherent privilege of the Crown, and an undoubted part of the Royal Prerogative of the Kings of this Kingdom to have the sole Choice and Appointment of the Offi|cers of States and Privy Councellors, and Nomination of the Lords of Session as in former times, and that the King's sacred Majesty, and his Heirs and Successors, are by virtue of that Royal Power which they hold from God Almighty over this Kingdom, to have the full exercise of that Right,</HI></HI> &amp;c. any Men could by a following <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> there be <HI>incapacitated</HI> to serve their <HI>Prince</HI> in those <HI>Stations.</HI></P>
<P>I shall here tell you, that the <HI>incapacitating</HI> a few <HI>Papists</HI> or <HI>Quakers Presbyterians</HI> or <HI>Anabaptists</HI> to serve their Prince may to some seem <HI>ma|teria l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">vis,</HI> and that the <HI>King</HI> and his <HI>Realm</HI> cannot suffer much by the <HI>dis|abling</HI> a small party of men from publick employments. But it is otherwise. And let any one who hath observ'd but two or three of the late great <HI>trans|actions</HI> of the <HI>age</HI> here, as for instance, the late King's <HI>Restoration,</HI> the throwing out of the <HI>Exclusion-Bill,</HI> the turning of the <HI>current</HI> of <HI>Faction</HI> in our <HI>Metropolis,</HI> and consider how much in each depended on the <HI>Talents</HI> of ONE man, he will not wonder at him who shall affirm that the <HI>incapaci|tating</HI> of but one Man may be very fatal to the Common-weal.</P>
<P>I suppose you cannot have forgot the <HI>Verse</HI> you repeated to me out of the famed <HI>Poem</HI> of <HI>Absolon</HI> and <HI>Achitophel,</HI> viz. <HI>So much the weight of one brave Man can do.</HI> And Providence made use of his <HI>weight</HI> for the Publick good by the figure he made in his Prince's <HI>Councils</HI> notwithstanding the <HI>Address</HI> of the <HI>Commons</HI> to have him thence <HI>removed:</HI> as likewise of the <HI>weight</HI> of another of those noble Persons <HI>heroical</HI> loyalty in the administra|tion of the Government, notwithstanding an <HI>Address</HI> from the Commons to his Prince to remove him from it.</P>
<P>I doubt not but you have read it in <HI>Cromerus</HI> his <HI>History</HI> of <HI>Poland l. 7th.</HI> that the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Poland</HI> being dead, the <HI>Kingdom</HI> was offer'd to <HI>Lescus</HI> a <HI>Nephew</HI> of <HI>Casimire</HI>'s, on condition he would banish <HI>Govoritius:</HI> and that <HI>Lescus refused</HI> the <HI>Crown</HI> rather then he would <HI>banish</HI> so <HI>faithful</HI> a <HI>Councel|lor.</HI> And you cannot be ignorant of the weight of one man in the <HI>Nicene</HI> Councel, I mean <HI>Pophnutiu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">,</HI> who by <HI>citing</HI> those words of the Author of the <HI>Epistle</HI> to the <HI>Hebrews, Marriage is honourable in all,</HI> &amp;c. turn'd the

<HI>stream</HI> of the whole <HI>Councel</HI> when they were going to give a Decree against the <HI>marriage</HI> of <HI>Priests.</HI></P>
<P>You know of how much <HI>weight</HI> one Man would have proved in that place in Scripture, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 22. 30. <HI>And I sought for a Man among them that should make up the Hedg and stand in the Gap,</HI> &amp;c. And that the <HI>wise</HI> man hath told us, that it was by the <HI>wisdom of ONE poor Man, that a City was deliver'd.</HI></P>
<P>You cannot but have observ'd, that almost all the great and noble <HI>in|ventions</HI> in nature, owe their births to a single Person; and that particu|larly <HI>one</HI> poor <HI>Man</HI> by his Wisdom discover'd the <HI>American</HI> World. I need not mind you of the introduction of Laws by <HI>one</HI> Man in several of the old <HI>Graecian</HI> Polities; and of the great <HI>Ocean</HI> of the <HI>Civil-Law</HI> yet encom|passing the World, having so <HI>narrow</HI> a Spring-head, as the head of a single Person's introducing the <HI>Laws</HI> at <HI>Athens.</HI></P>
<P>You have read of the <HI>unus homo nobis cuncta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">do,</HI> &amp;c. and of the <HI>tantum potuit unius Viri fortuna &amp; virtus.</HI></P>
<P>You know how Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> express'd her <HI>value</HI> of the <HI>weight</HI> of <HI>one</HI> Man, I mean our great Navigator Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> by her refusing to <HI>commissionate</HI> competent Judges to try him for putting to death <HI>Dourishius</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> and after an <HI>Appeal</HI> brought about it by the next of Kinn to him: and how afterward King <HI>Iames</HI> the <HI>first</HI> shew'd his value of the <HI>Ta|lents</HI> and usefulness of Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI> by employing him in his Ser|vice, with Power of the Life and Death of others, whilst he lay under the highest <HI>disability,</HI> by being attainted of High-Treason.</P>
<P>It would be somewhat like <HI>pedantry</HI> to digress too far into such a <HI>Com|mon Place;</HI> and wherein almost infinite instances will be tumultuarily crowding into any Mans thoughts. But I shall here further tell you, that from the notion of <HI>ludit in humanis,</HI> &amp;c. and of him who <HI>sitteth</HI> in <HI>the Hea|vens</HI> having some Disablers <HI>in derisien</HI> who <HI>imagined a vain</HI> thing, and from Heavens often choosing to make <HI>that Stone that the Builders rejected</HI> and disabled, <HI>the Head of the Corner:</HI> and from the severe threatning in St. <HI>Mat|thew</HI> against him <HI>who shall offend ONE of these little ones who believe in Christ,</HI> and from the caution there of <HI>despising not ONE of these little ones,</HI> you may occasionally call to mind your <HI>moral</HI> Offices of <HI>honouring all Men,</HI> and of adoring the <HI>Divine</HI> Providence, when it makes such Persons its instru|ments in the preserving of Nations, who by any <HI>systemes</HI> of <HI>Politics</HI> or Laws were <HI>disabled</HI> from being such.</P>

<P>You find it DECLARED in the <HI>Statute</HI> of the <HI>31th.</HI> of <HI>H.</HI> 8. <HI>c.</HI> 10. that <HI>It appertaineth to the King's Prerogative Royal to give such Ho|nour, Reputation and Placing to his Councellors, AND OTHER his Subjects, as shall be seeming to his most excellent Wisdom;</HI> and so when King <HI>Iames</HI> gave Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> tho <HI>dead</HI> in <HI>Law,</HI> and labouring under the highest <HI>disability</HI> beforemention'd, the Power and Honour of commanding the lives of others, he did but what <HI>appertain'd to his Prerogative.</HI></P>
<P>And thus when King <HI>Harry</HI> the <HI>8th</HI> by his <HI>Prerogative,</HI> like the <HI>Sun</HI> both raising and gilding a poor <HI>Vapour,</HI> made <HI>Cromwel</HI> who was the Son of a Black-smith <HI>Lord Privy-Seal,</HI> and likewise enabled him, tho a <HI>Lay-man,</HI> to to be his <HI>Vice-gerent</HI> for <HI>ecclesiastical</HI> Causes, and however <HI>incapacitated</HI> by some positive humane Laws to make that figure, he did but <HI>uti Iure suo.</HI></P>
<P>And I shall tell you as to the subject of the <HI>weight</HI> of <HI>one</HI> Man, or the consequences of <HI>disabling</HI> one Man, that we were upon; if you consider how much the excesses of the <HI>Papal</HI> Usurpations, and the <HI>over-ballance</HI> of the <HI>Monastic</HI> Revenue in the Nation, were removed by the <HI>parts</HI> and <HI>en|dowments</HI> of <HI>Cromwel</HI> the <HI>Vice-gerent</HI> in Matters Ecclesiastical, you may easily imagine that if the measures of the <HI>Canon-Law</HI> and <HI>Canonists</HI> and the long receiv'd <HI>customs</HI> or any <HI>humane</HI> Law had then prevail'd for the <HI>disa|bling</HI> of <HI>Cromwel cum effectu</HI> from bearing <HI>Office</HI> or <HI>intermedling</HI> in <HI>Ecclesia|stical</HI> Jurisdiction as the Kings <HI>Vice-gerent,</HI> what a <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> we should have at this time enjoy'd.</P>
<P>You may well imagine how much the <HI>Disabling</HI> of <HI>Lay-men</HI> from inter|medling in ecclesiastical <HI>Iurisdiction</HI> had passed for a <HI>general</HI> Custom here, when Bishop <HI>Downham</HI> in the <HI>Defence of his Consecration Sermon</HI> p. 185. saith that <HI>as for lay-Chancellors or Commissaries, the Bishops in the times of S.</HI> Austin <HI>and S.</HI> Ambrose <HI>had none: and that not so much as the Steward of a Church might be a Lay-man:</HI> and when the <HI>Puritan</HI> Writers did still up|braid our Discipline on the account of the incapacity of <HI>Lay-men</HI> to be Bi|shops Chancellors, as adjudged by the ancient <HI>Canons;</HI> and with the <HI>Ca|non</HI> of <HI>indecorum est laicum esse vicarium episcopi,</HI> &amp;c. and by which <HI>Canon</HI> the Bishop who made a <HI>Lay-man</HI> his Vicar, was declared to be <HI>contemptor Canonum.</HI></P>
<P>But it was the <HI>Regal</HI> Power of <HI>Dispensing</HI> with the <HI>Canons</HI> and <HI>Customs</HI> that <HI>disabled</HI> Lay-men from intermedling in <HI>ecclesiastical</HI> Jurisdiction, that laid the <HI>foundation</HI> of the Reformation in <HI>Harry</HI> the <HI>8th</HI>'s time, as it was the same Power of dispensing with the <HI>Canons</HI> and <HI>Customs</HI> that <HI>disabled</HI> Clergy-men from intermedling in <HI>saecular</HI> Employments, that perfected the <HI>superstructure</HI> of it in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>6th</HI> that young <HI>Iosias,</HI> as was before mention'd.</P>
<P><HI>Fuller</HI> tells us in his <HI>Church-history</HI> that <HI>Harry</HI> the <HI>8th</HI>'s <HI>making a Lay|man</HI>
<PB N="60" REF="34">
<HI>his Vicar-general was the greatest instance of his ecclesiastical Power that ever was given.</HI> And my Lord <HI>Herbert</HI> in his <HI>Harry</HI> the <HI>8th</HI> doth seem to reflect on <HI>Cromwel</HI>'s not being thought capable of that Office: for his words on his being made the King's Vicegerent are, <HI>It was thought strange by the People, because there was no Example of any Kings of</HI> Israel <HI>the lawfully in their own Persons enjoying the mixt Power of the Temporal and Spiritual, or of the Pope's, having deputed Ecclesiastical Power to a Lay-man.</HI> But as to his saying that there was no <HI>Example</HI> of the Pope's deputing Ecclesiastical Power to Lay-men, I shall observe that his Lordship had not consider'd that according to the <HI>Glosse in C. bene quidem</HI> Distin. 96. <HI>Laicus potest ex|communicare ex Papae delegatione:</HI> and that tho a <HI>Bishop</HI> cannot by the <HI>Canon-Law delegate</HI> his Power to a <HI>Lay-man,</HI> for that a <HI>Bishop</HI> is not above the <HI>Ius Commune Positivum</HI> of the Pope, yet the <HI>Canonists</HI> hold that the Pope by the Plenitude of his Power may <HI>dispense</HI> with his own <HI>Laws,</HI> and by so doing delegate the Power of <HI>Excommunicating</HI> to <HI>Abbesses,</HI> altho <HI>jure Communi,</HI> as not having the <HI>Power</HI> of the <HI>Keys,</HI> they are <HI>disabled</HI> from so doing: and that Pope <HI>Urban</HI> the Second, constituted a Lay-man, <HI>Roger</HI> Earl of <HI>Sicily</HI> and his <HI>Heirs,</HI> his <HI>Legates a latere</HI> in that Kingdom by way of <HI>Inheritance</HI> for ever: and that our <HI>Henry</HI> the Second writing to the Pope to recall <HI>Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ket</HI>'s Legatine <HI>Power,</HI> and to confer it on the Archbishop of <HI>York,</HI> the Pope refused so to do, but offer'd the <HI>Legatine</HI> Power to the <HI>King</HI> himself, and sent Letters to the King for that purpose: but which the King in scorn threw away.</P>
<P>The <HI>Legatine</HI> Powers are <HI>de jure Communi,</HI> as the <HI>Canonists</HI> tell us, very great; and allow the <HI>Legates</HI> to visit or cause to be visited by such as they shall think fit, all Churches, Monasteries, Colleges, Universities, Hospi|tals, and do authorize them to make new Statutes and Orders, and not on|ly to receive Appeals from ordinary Judges and Delegates, but to judge and decide all Ecclesiastical, Civil and Criminal Causes, and that summarily and <HI>sine form&acirc; &amp; figur&acirc; Iudicii;</HI> to make Prisoners of Bishops, and send them in Custody to the Pope, to bestow Benefices that were vacant, to unite Churches, to interpret the Mandates of the Pope: and if the Pope hath entrusted any thing to be done by them, yet to entrust the doing thereof to others, to execute all their Jurisdiction in Places <HI>exempt</HI> as well as not exempt, and to <HI>dispense</HI> in all Cases wherein they are not Prohibi|ted, and to exercise the <HI>Iurisdiction</HI> of granting <HI>Indulgences,</HI> and to <HI>dis|pense</HI> with <HI>pluralists,</HI> and with the <HI>incapacity</HI> of <HI>Sons</HI> immediately <HI>succeeding</HI> their <HI>Fathers</HI> in Church-Livings, and to give Absolution to the Excommu|nicate in many Cases reserv'd to the <HI>Apostolick</HI> See, and likewise in many Causes inflictive of Excommunication <HI>ipso jure,</HI> and in many Cases to re|store such as are <HI>deposed</HI> and <HI>degraded,</HI> and to rehabilitate them even by <HI>re|storing</HI> them to <HI>Fame.</HI></P>
<P>All these <HI>Branches</HI> of <HI>Authority,</HI> with many others not named here, were it seems offer'd by the <HI>Pope</HI> to our <HI>King:</HI> but which he holding as <HI>Vice|gerent</HI> to the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Kings,</HI> and by his <HI>Word,</HI> might well refuse their <HI>tenure</HI> from the <HI>servus servorum,</HI> and by his <HI>Bulls.</HI></P>
<P>All our Roman-Catholick Princes having made an inroad on the <HI>Papal</HI> incapacitating <HI>Canons</HI> by way of <HI>Dispensation,</HI> when they made their Lay-Judges <HI>Super-Intendents</HI> over their <HI>Bishops,</HI> and who were by Lay-men re|quired to <HI>Absolve</HI> such who were <HI>disabled</HI> by <HI>Excommunication,</HI> and to re|ceive their bounds and measures in Ecclesiastical Proceedings by <HI>Writs</HI> of <HI>Prohibition,</HI> and <HI>Consultation,</HI> and <HI>Attachment</HI> issued out by Lay-men; the exercise of the <HI>Regal</HI> Power in Ecclesiasticks distributed and dispers'd among so many <HI>Lay</HI> hands, did not seem so powerful nor invidious as when the
<PB N="61" REF="34">
<HI>united</HI> Beams of Ecclesiastical <HI>Vice-gerence</HI> met in the Ministry of <HI>one</HI> Lay Person, and dazled the Eyes of the whole Kingdom, and when (according to the Power that was 37^o. <HI>H.</HI> 8. <HI>declared</HI> by the Parliament to be given to the King by <HI>Holy Scripture</HI>) he made <HI>Cromwel</HI> his Vice-gerent for the Eccle|siastical Jurisdiction.</P>
<P>But as that <HI>Statute</HI> intimating that <HI>the Councils and Constitutions Provincial</HI> that ordain'd, <HI>that no Lay-man should exercise or occupy any Iurisdiction Ecclesiastical, did stand and remain in their effect not abo|lish'd by his Grace's Laws, and did sound to appear to make greatly for the usurped Power of the Bishop of</HI> Rome, <HI>and to he directly repugnant to his Majesty as Supreme Head of the Church, and Pretogative Royal, his Grace being a Lay-man, altho such Decrees, Ordinances, and Con|stitutions</HI> were by <HI>the Statute made in the</HI> 25th <HI>year of his Reign, in|tended to be utterly abolish'd, frustrate,</HI> &amp;c. but yet that <HI>the contrary thereunto,</HI> being not <HI>used by Archbishops, Bishops,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>i. e.</HI> that they had not all that while or since that <HI>Statute</HI> of the 25th of his <HI>Reign</HI> com|mitted the exercise of Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction to <HI>Lay-men;</HI> did or might give <HI>occasion to some Evil-dispos'd persons to think and little regard the Proceedings and Censures Ecclesiastical made by his HIGH|NESSE and his Uice-gerent, Officials, Commissaries, Iudges, and Uisitors being also Lay and Married men to be of little or none effect, whereby the people gathereth heart and presumption to do evil, and not to have such reverence to your most Godly Injunctions and Proceedings, as becometh them&punc;</HI> &amp;c. So I leave it to you to consider how the <HI>disabling</HI> of any <HI>subjects</HI> by reason of <HI>Religionary</HI> Heterodoxy to <HI>serve</HI> their <HI>Prince, did or might give occasion to some evil-disposed Persons</HI> to attempt the <HI>disa|bling</HI> of their <HI>Prince</HI> on the same account, as I b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">fore <HI>hinted</HI> it to you: and as the popular incogitancy of the <HI>Power</HI> given by <HI>God</HI> extending to <HI>all such Persons as should be employ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">d under the King,</HI> producing the <HI>irreverence</HI> of their surmises of the <HI>incapacity</HI> of the <HI>Officials</HI> and <HI>Visitors</HI> employ'd by the <HI>Vicegerent</HI> (and consequently of the incapacity of the <HI>Vicegerent himself</HI>) did naturally terminate in their <HI>gathering heart and presumption to do evil,</HI> and to surmise the King's being <HI>disabled</HI> to <HI>exercise</HI> all manner of <HI>Ecclesiasti|cal</HI> Jurisdiction: and to do that which was <HI>directly repugnant to his Majesty as Supreme Head of the Church, and to his Prerogative Royal, his Grace being a Lay-man,</HI> how you ought still to preserve a tenderness in your thoughts for that <HI>Prerogative</HI> Royal given him by <HI>God's Word</HI> of <HI>Commanding</HI> the <HI>Services</HI> of all his Subjects by what Laws or Constitutions soever <HI>de facto</HI> incapacitated.

<P>Well <HI>Sir:</HI> Let it for the present pass as a <HI>datum</HI> or <HI>concessum,</HI> as you will have it, that the <HI>Obedience</HI> of <HI>Subjects,</HI> in <HI>serving</HI> their <HI>Prince</HI> is founded on the grounds both of <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Scripture.</HI> And I shall moreover allow it to you, that if you had an <HI>Enthusiast</HI> to deal with, and such who as you said <HI>do outrage the 13th of the</HI> Romans <HI>out of the</HI> Apocalypse, you might out of <HI>Brightman</HI>'s <HI>Revelation of the</HI> Apocalypse, shew him out of that part of <HI>Holy Scripture</HI> sufficient Authority for the King's particularly making <HI>Cromwel</HI> his <HI>Vicegerent.</HI> For he there on the 14th <HI>Chapter,</HI> and the 17th, and following Verses, saith, <HI>This Angel is</HI> Thomas Cromwel <HI>who lived in the days of</HI> Harry <HI>the 8th, that most mighty King, and was a man of great renown and place in our Kingdoms, being the Earl of</HI> Essex, <HI>and Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal,</HI> who came out of the Temple, <HI>and being a sincere favou|rer of pure Religion.</HI> He had a Sickle in his hand, <HI>being made the King's Deputy in all Ecclesiastical Matters: and it was a sharp one, as with which he sets stoutly and deliberately to his work, and yet he had no Crown or Diadem to grace his head withal, being a Minister rather to put another Man's Power in Ure, then any that wrought by his own Power and Authority.</HI> And he on <HI>Verse</HI> the 18th makes the <HI>other Angel</HI> to be a <HI>Martyr:</HI> viz. <HI>Tho. Cranmer,</HI> and refers the meaning of the words, <HI>He cryed with a great voice to him that had the Sickle,</HI> to <HI>Cranmer, because</HI> (saith he) <HI>in the days of</HI> Harry <HI>the 8th, he inflamed the mind of</HI> Tho.

<P>I thank you for diverting me with that <HI>passage</HI> of <HI>Brightman:</HI> but I can refer you to another Writer of our Church, whose Authority will go further with us then <HI>Brightman</HI>'s, and who hath recorded it, that the great figure that <HI>Cromwel</HI> made both in the Church and State, and his and <HI>Cran|mer</HI>'s acting together in concert, and by joynt Councels both in Church and at the Helm of State, was so highly fortunate to the Reformation. You may find this observed by Archbishop <HI>Parker</HI> in his <HI>De Antiquitate Ecclesi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> Britannicoe,</HI> p. 530. where he saith, <HI>Namque profligato Papa, &amp; suscept&acirc; Ec|clesioe Anglicanoe defensione, cur&acirc; &amp; tutel&acirc;, Rex excelsi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ii, &amp; multa|rum rerum usu peritum,</HI> Thomam Cromwellum <HI>Vicarium suum in spirituali|bus generalem designavit.

<P>I shall therefore here once for all tell you, that the occasion of so many mens <HI>mistake</HI> in thinking so many of those <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> in <HI>Harry</HI> the 8th's time prejudicial to Prerogative, as seeming to found it on Statute-Law, is their not considering that such <HI>Statutes</HI> were but <HI>declara|tory</HI> of old Laws, and not <HI>introductive</HI> of new ones. My Lord Primate

<HI>Bramhal</HI> in his <HI>Schism guarded,</HI> p. 155. saith, <HI>I profess clearly I do not see what advantage</HI> Henry <HI>the 8th could make of his own Laws, which he might not have made of the ancient Laws, except only a gawdy Title of Head of the English Church which survived him not long, and the Tenths and first|fruits of the Clergy,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But you may as fully take notice how <HI>Harry</HI> the 8th throughout his great <HI>Declarative</HI> Laws so often <HI>declares</HI> in effect his <HI>Regal</HI> Power to be given him by God.

And the <HI>Statute</HI> of 37^o <HI>H.</HI> 8. begins as I shew'd you with the three Estates, DECLARING, <HI>That the King's Majesty is and hath always justly been Supreme Head in the Earth of the Church of</HI> England <HI>by the Word of God.</HI> You know too how the <HI>style</HI> runs in another of his <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Parliament,</HI> viz. <HI>The Bishop of</HI> Rome <HI>and See Apostolick, contrary to the great and inviolable Grants of Iurisdictions by God immediately to Emperors, Kings, and Prin|ces,</HI> &amp;c. And thus tho there are various <HI>Statutes</HI> in his Reign, and parti|cularly that of the 25th <HI>year</HI> of his Reign, <HI>c.</HI> 19. by which it was Enacted, <HI>That the King's Highness shall have Power and Authority to nominate and assign at his pleasure Two and thirty persons, whereof Sixteen to be of the Clergy, and Sixteen of the Temporalty of the Upper and Nether House of the Parliament to view, search, and examine the Ca|nous, Constitutions and Ordinances Provincial, and that such of them as the King's Highness and the said Two and thirty or the Major part of them shall de&eacute;m and adjudge worthy to be continued, kept and obey'd, shall be~ from henceforth kept obey'd and executed within this Realm, so that the Kings most Royal assent under his Great Seal be first had to the same,</HI> &amp;c. and tho according to the ancient usage of the Realm as well as to those Canons <HI>Lay-men</HI> were not only incapacitated to make Ecclesia|stical Constitutions and Canons, but <HI>Kings, Bishops, or Noblemen who be|lieved that the Decrees of the Bishops of</HI> Rome <HI>may be violated or shall suffer them so to be,</HI> are in the Canon Law <HI>anathematized,</HI> yet as this <HI>enacting</HI> Clause was made on the <HI>Clergy</HI>'s Petition to the <HI>King</HI> (as the <HI>Preamble</HI> of the <HI>Act</HI> mentions) <HI>that those Constitutions and Canons may be commit|ted to the Examination and Iudgment of his Highness, and of Two and Thirty persons of the King's Subjects, whereof sixteen were to be of the Upper and Nether House of the Parliament, of the Temporalty; and all the said Two and thirty persons to be chosen and appointed by the King's Majesty,</HI> &amp;c. and be empower'd to do what I mention'd out of the <HI>enacting</HI> Clause (and whereby the <HI>King</HI> alone was in <HI>effect</HI> both according to the <HI>Clergy</HI>'s Petition, and the <HI>enacting</HI> Clause vested with the <HI>jus vitoe &amp; necis</HI> of the <HI>Canons</HI>) so in a Memorable <HI>Epistle</HI> of <HI>Harry</HI> the 8th. Printed before the <HI>Reformatio legum Ecclesiasticarum,</HI> and intended as a draught for a Publication or <HI>Promulgation</HI> of the King's new Ecclesiastical Laws, after the draught of them had been by those Clergymen and Laymen prepared for his Royal Consideration, and been by him establish'd, he there declares his Power of so doing to be pursuant to his <HI>Supreme Headship of the Church of England</HI> recogniz'd, <HI>quemadmodum divini atque humani juris tatio po|stulat,</HI> and mentions, <HI>the Power granted to him and his Ancestors <HI>ipso jure divino,</HI></HI> as <HI>recognized,</HI> and applies to himself the words <HI>Sapientioe,</HI> cap. 7. <HI>Audite Reges &amp; intelligite quoniam data est a Domino potestas vobis,</HI> &amp;c. and <HI>founding</HI> his <HI>Power</HI> of making Ecclesiastical Laws on that <HI>jus Divinum,</HI> he saith, <HI>En vobis authoritate nostra editas leges damus,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="36">And here I shall tell you that as <HI>my Lord</HI> Coke <HI>in</HI> Cawdry's <HI>Case</HI> calls the <HI>Act</HI> of the <HI>24th</HI> of <HI>H.</HI> 8. beforemention'd, An <HI>Act declaratory</HI> of the <HI>An|cient</HI> Law; so he likewise doth the <HI>Act</HI> of the <HI>25th</HI> of his Reign, <HI>c.</HI> 21. that so much props up the <HI>Dispensative</HI> Power. And I assure you that they look but at a few things in general, and in that <HI>Statute</HI> in particular, who think that the <HI>Dispensative</HI> Power <HI>inherent</HI> in the King lost any ground thereby: and he who takes the <HI>Statute</HI> altogether, will find that that Power if it <HI>seem'd</HI> in any words to go back from it self, was but by such retreat to leap the further forward.</P>
<P>For if you will take a <HI>glancing</HI> view of the intent of that <HI>Statute</HI> to that end, you will see that instead of <HI>that</HI> Law making it self to be the <HI>Foun|tain</HI> of the <HI>Dispensative</HI> Power, it makes the Dispensative Power to be the very <HI>Fountain</HI> of a great part of the Common Law it self: for its style gives you the figure of our <HI>Laws,</HI> as either <HI>devised, made and obtain'd within this Realm for the wealth of the same, or such as by SUFFERANCE of your Grace and your Progenitors</HI> (which is a <HI>Dispensation</HI> by way of <HI>Permission</HI> or <HI>Connivence) <HI>the People of this your Realm have taken at their free Liberty by their own Consent to be used among them, and have bound themselves by long use and Custom to the observance of the same,</HI></HI> &amp;c. And the King in his Legislative Capacity having with the con|sent of the three Estates superseded the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Dispensative Power that had so long Usurp'd on the King's Laws, and having provided that the Money that should be paid as <HI>Fees</HI> for <HI>Dispensations</HI> should be <HI>rais'd</HI> and <HI>mode|rated</HI> by their Consent, obtain'd from them a <HI>Clause</HI> in the <HI>Act</HI> containing so great a <HI>deference</HI> to the <HI>Dispensative</HI> Power of the <HI>Crown,</HI> as that after the <HI>Act</HI> had authorized the <HI>Archbishop</HI> of <HI>Canterbury</HI> and his <HI>Successors <HI>to grant such Dispensations, Licences and Faculties as were accustomed to be had from the See of</HI></HI> Rome, <HI>and not grant any others till the King, his Heirs and Successors, or their Councel were first advertised thereof, and determined whether they should pass:</HI> It <HI>Provided</HI> that <HI>if it were thought and determin'd by the King, his Heirs and Successors, or their Councel, that Dispensations, Faculties, Licences, or other Writings in any such Case UNWONT shall pass, that then the said Archbishop or his Commissary having Licence of His Majesty, his Heirs and Suc|cessors for the same shall dispense with them accordingly: and in Case of his refusing to dispense, that any other two Bishops, the King, his Heirs and Successors should nominate, should be appointed to dispense in such Cases.</HI> And this <HI>Act</HI> with all the <HI>Clauses</HI> in it, you find reviv'd by the <HI>1st.</HI> of <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> c. 1.</P>
<P>The Pope's <HI>rehabilitations</HI> did <HI>customarily</HI> extend to <HI>Lay-men</HI> as well as <HI>Clergy-men,</HI> and that particularly in case of <HI>Heterodoxy</HI> in Religion, then call'd <HI>Heresy,</HI> which both by ancient <HI>usage</HI> and <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> loaded men with various <HI>incapacities.</HI> And his relaxing the <HI>incapaci|ties</HI> that relate to Clergy-men, any one may see by the <HI>Taxa Cameroe</HI> and the <HI>Fees</HI> thereby payable, <HI>viz.</HI> in the <HI>Age</HI> of those who were to take Orders and were defective in some of their Members, and in the <HI>Case</HI> of Clergy-mens incapacity incurr'd by <HI>irregularity.</HI> But after this <HI>Act</HI> of the 25. of <HI>H.</HI> the <HI>8th,</HI> had shew'd the World the Authority the King had to <HI>rehabilitate</HI> and <HI>dispense</HI> here in his <HI>own</HI> Country both as to matters <HI>customarily</HI> dispens'd with at <HI>Rome,</HI> and such as were <HI>not</HI> so, and how <HI>small</HI> the <HI>Fees</HI> were for the same, the bringing <HI>rehabilitations,</HI> and <HI>Perinde valere's</HI> from <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> was like carrying <HI>Coals</HI> to <HI>New-Castle.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Premising</HI> to you that the <HI>Christian</HI> offices do more call on you to mind what <HI>Sins</HI> you <HI>dispense</HI> with in your self, then what the <HI>Pope</HI> dispen|seth with in others, and that this <HI>present</HI> Pope hath spoil'd the <HI>Trade</HI> of <HI>raillery</HI> about <HI>Indulgences</HI> by <HI>spoiling</HI> the <HI>Trade</HI> of them, and <HI>damning</HI> so great a <HI>number</HI> of them, and that in his vast Supplies of Money toward the taking of <HI>Buda,</HI> the <HI>Souls</HI> in <HI>Purgatory</HI> contributed nothing, and that Sir <HI>Paul Ricaut</HI> in the <HI>Life</HI> of <HI>this Pope,</HI> having done <HI>right</HI> to his <HI>Vertue,</HI> in mentioning <HI>his having suppress'd an Office of the Virgin</HI> Mary, <HI>and a multi|tude of Indulgences,</HI> hath further judiciously observ'd, That <HI>Wisemen at the Councel of</HI> Trent <HI>finding that the Doctrine of Indulgences was not solid, did but slightly touch it; and tho yet it was the CHIEF matter for which that Councel was assembled, nothing was determin'd therein, but only that Indul|gences be used with such Moderation as was approved by the Ancient Custom of the Church, that is, not at all;</HI> I say <HI>premising</HI> all this, I shall mind you that I have said enough already to let you see that it is only the <HI>ancient</HI> Dis|pensative <HI>Iurisdiction</HI> of the <HI>Crown</HI> that I direct you to prop up, and more particularly with respect to the Case before you.</P>
<P>While we are considering the <HI>Obligation</HI> of an <HI>Oath,</HI> it were pity that the thoughts of either of us should be <HI>embarras'd</HI> with <HI>Moot-points;</HI> and so without troubling you with a reference to <HI>More,</HI> f. 463. <HI>where all the Power of the Pope is not given to the King by the 25th of</HI> H. <HI>the 8th, but is extinct,</HI> Hallywel'<HI>s Case;</HI> or to the quite <HI>contrary</HI> in <HI>More</HI> 542. <HI>Armiger's Case,</HI> I shall most consult the ease of your thoughts by directing them to what in|terpretation my Lord <HI>Coke</HI> in <HI>Cawdrys</HI> Case gives as to the words of the <HI>Statute</HI> of 1^o <HI>Eliz.</HI> and where he saith, <HI>that that Act doth not annex any Iurisdiction to the Crown but what was of right or ought to be by the Ancient Laws of this Realm, parcel of the King's Iurisdiction,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and which lawfully had been or might be exercised within the Realm. The end of which Iuris|diction, and of all the Proceedings thereupon, that all things might be done in Causes Ecclesiastical to the Pleasure of Almighty God, encrease of Vertue, and the Conservation of the Peace and Unity of the Realm, as by divers places of the Act appears. And therefore by this Act no pretended Iurisdiction ex|ercised within this Realm being ungodly, or repugnant to the ancient Law of the Crown, was or could be restored to the Crown according to the ancient Right and Law of the same.</HI></P>
<P>And here I may tell you, that as the <HI>Pope</HI> did often <HI>dispense</HI> with <HI>inca|pacity</HI> incurr'd by his <HI>Positive</HI> Laws, and that even in the use of the Power of the Keys, as by his delegating the Power of Excommunication to Lay|men, and to Abbesses as aforesaid; so our <HI>Kings</HI> d d <HI>anciently</HI> by their <HI>Let|ters Patents</HI> and <HI>Charters,</HI> grant <HI>Power</HI> to those who were no <HI>Bishops, Ordi|naries,</HI>
<PB N="67" REF="37">
or Ecclesiastical <HI>Iudges</HI> or <HI>Officers</HI> to inflict Ecclesiastical <HI>Censures</HI> of the <HI>greater Excommunication</HI> on Offenders, and that for <HI>Causes</HI> not mere|ly <HI>Spiritual</HI> or <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> with Power to <HI>Certify</HI> them into <HI>Chancery,</HI> and thereupon to obtain <HI>Writs de Excommunicato Capiendo,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Prynne</HI> tells us in his <HI>Animadversions on the Fourth part of the Institutes,</HI> and there <HI>cites</HI> the <HI>President</HI> of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, thus empow'ring the <HI>Chancellor</HI> of the <HI>University</HI> of <HI>Oxford,</HI> tho a <HI>Lay-man</HI> so to do, and so to Punish <HI>Breakers of the Peace, Offenders against the Statutes, Privileges and Customs of the University, and all Forestallers, and Regraters, and Sellers of corrupt Meat and Wine, and to Excommunicate such who refused to cleanse the Streets from filth, and to Pave them before their Doors, and this</HI> (he saith) <HI>was confirm'd by sundry succeeding Statutes of our Princes.</HI></P>
<P>In what <HI>particulars</HI> it is by this <HI>Statute</HI> of the 25. of <HI>H.</HI> the <HI>8th.</HI> war|ranted that the <HI>King, his Heirs and Successors</HI> may <HI>dispense</HI> with <HI>Persons</HI> and in <HI>Causes</HI> that the <HI>Papacy</HI> was never accustomed to dispense in, I shall not trouble you or my self to enquire: but shall tell you, that Mr. <HI>Nye</HI> in his <HI>Book</HI> call'd <HI>Two Acts of Parliament,</HI> and wherein are contain'd his <HI>Ob|servations on the Oath of Supremacy,</HI> doth in <HI>p.</HI> 164. <HI>cite</HI> this <HI>Statute</HI> of 25. <HI>H.</HI> 8. <HI>c.</HI> 21. and thereupon say, <HI>the King's Majesty may dispense with any of those Canons or Ecclesiastical Laws,</HI> (meaning the King's Ecclesiastical Laws) <HI>indulge the Omission of what is enjoyn'd by them: make void the Crime and remove the Penalty incurred by breach of them: yea, and give faculty to do and practice otherwise, any Synodal Establishment, or long usage to the Contrary notwithstanding, in what offends not the Holy Scripture and Laws of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>And therefore when our <HI>Soveraign</HI> in the course of his <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> Su|premacy, doth only <HI>dispense</HI> with <HI>incapacity,</HI> we are sure he goes not to the <HI>height</HI> of the Dispensative Power justify'd in him by that <HI>Statute:</HI> no|thing having been more <HI>customary</HI> to the <HI>Papacy</HI> then <HI>rehabilitation.</HI></P>
<P>It was upon the <HI>Revival</HI> of this <HI>Statute</HI> of <HI>Harry</HI> the 8th, by that <HI>first</HI> of Queen <HI>Eliz.</HI> c. 1. that <HI>she,</HI> according to the <HI>Papal</HI> custom of <HI>dispen|sing</HI> with the <HI>Commutation</HI> of <HI>Penance,</HI> did in her Articles in the <HI>Synod</HI> began at <HI>London,</HI> A. D. 1548. establish one <HI>De moderand&acirc; solennis Poenitentioe Commutatione,</HI> whereby she orders, that <HI>such Commutation shall be but sel|dom and for weighty Causes, and when it shall appear to the Bishop that that way is the safer to reform the guilty Person, and that the Commutation|Money be employ'd to Pious uses.</HI> And then follows <HI>the Title. <HI>De Mode|randis quibusdam Indulgentus pro Celebratione Matrimonii absque tri|nundin&acirc; denunciatione quam bannos vocant Matrimoniales,</HI></HI> where you will find she makes <HI>Faculties</HI> and <HI>Indulgences</HI> all one.</P>
<P>And as I have shew'd you how she thought it necessary for the safety of her Subjects Consciences to exercise her Dispensative Power of <HI>interpreting,</HI> and of relaxing <HI>disabilities</HI> occasion'd by the very first <HI>Statute</HI> of her <HI>Reign,</HI> and how soon she put the <HI>Dispensative</HI> Power of those kinds in pra|ctice, which by that <HI>Statute</HI> were restored and united to her Imperial Crown, so I may observe to you <HI>that</HI> shortly after the making of the <HI>Second</HI> Statute in her <HI>Reign,</HI> viz. That for <HI>Uniformity of Prayer and Administra|tion of Sacraments,</HI> which punisheth with <HI>Premunire, Sequestration, and Deprivation, and Excommunication</HI> (which while it is depending is so vari|ously inclusive of <HI>disability</HI>) the not using the <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Common-Prayer</HI> as Publish'd in <HI>English;</HI> she by her <HI>Letters Patents</HI> dated the <HI>6th</HI> of <HI>April</HI> in the Second <HI>year</HI> of her <HI>Reign,</HI> and <HI>A.</HI> 1560. alloweth the use of <HI>Latine Prayers to the Colleges of both Universities, and to</HI> Eaton <HI>and</HI> Win|chester

<P>But what may perhaps seem to you as a new <HI>Indication</HI> of her being the better able to <HI>dispense</HI> with it, is an <HI>Instance</HI> I shall give you of her <HI>making</HI> incapacity by her <HI>Supreme</HI> Ecclesiastical <HI>Power.</HI> The instance of her thus <HI>making</HI> incapacity, is a thing that Mr. <HI>Nye</HI> in his <HI>Beams of for|mer Light</HI> reflects on as <HI>strange:</HI> for he <HI>there</HI> in <HI>p.</HI> 201. referring to Queen <HI>Elizabeth's Injunctions,</HI> A. 1559. <HI>Injunct.</HI> 29. viz. <HI>It is thought very necessary that no manner of Priest or Deacon shall hereafter take to his Wife any manner of Woman without the Advice and Allowance first had by the Bishop of the Diocese, and two Iustices of the Peace next to the place of her abode,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and if any shall do otherwise, they shall not be permitted to Preach the Word, or give Sacraments, nor be Capable of any Ecclesiastical Benefice;</HI> saith then, <HI>Doth this seem strange now?

<P>I can easily direct you to such a <HI>Writer</HI> of our Church who hath done the thing to the universal Satisfaction of the Inquisitive as to this Point, and that is the Lord Primate <HI>Bramhal</HI> in his <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Schism Guarded.</HI></P>
<P>He saith there, in <HI>p.</HI> 330, and 331. <HI>As our Grievances, so our Reforma|tion was only of the abuses of the Roman Court. Their bestowing of Prela|cies and Dignities in</HI> England <HI>to the Prejudice of the right Patrons; Their Convocating Synods in</HI> England <HI>without the King's leave; Their Prohibiting English Prelates to make their old feudal Oaths to the King, and obliging them to take new Oaths of Fidelity to the Pope; Their imposing and receiving Tenths and first Fruits, and other Arbitrary Pensions upon the English Clergy; <HI>and lastly, their Usurping a Legislative Iudiciary and Dispen|sative Power in the exterior Court by Political Coaction;</HI> these are all the branches of Papal Power which we have rejected. This Reformation is all the Separation that we have made in point of Discipline. And for Do|ctrine we have no difference with them about the old Essentials of Christian Religion: and their new Essentials which they have patch'd to the Creed are but their erroneous, or at the best, probable Opinions; no Articles of Faith.</HI> Thus then according to these measures, you see how much the <HI>hinge</HI> of the <HI>Reformation</HI> turns on the <HI>Usurpation</HI> of the <HI>Papacy</HI> in <HI>Dispen|sing:</HI> for in all these particulars enumerated, the Pope <HI>dispens'd</HI> with the King's <HI>Laws.</HI> And he had before in <HI>p.</HI> 26. said, <HI>This Primacy neither the Ancients nor we deny to St.</HI> Peter, <HI>of Order, of Place, of Preheminence. If this first movership would serve his turn, the Controversie were at an end for our parts. But this Primacy is over-lean; the Court of</HI> Rome <HI>have no</HI> gusto <HI>to it. They thirst after a visible Monarchy on Earth, an abso|lute</HI>
<PB N="69" REF="38">
<HI>Ecclesiastical Soveraignty; <HI>a Power to make Canons, to abolish Canons, to dispense with Canons:</HI> to impose Pensions, to dispose of Dig|nities, to decide Controversies by a single Authority. This was that which made the breach; not the Innocent Primacy of St.</HI> Peter. And afterward in <HI>p.</HI> 149. he saith, <HI>But I must contract my Discourse to those Dispensations that are intended in the Laws of</HI> Henry <HI>the</HI> 8th, <HI>that is the Power to dis|pense with English Laws in the exterior Court: Let him bind or loose inwardly whom he will: whether his Key erre or not, we are not con|cern'd. Secondly, As he is a Prince in his own Territories, he that hath Power to bind, hath Power to loose. He that hath Power to make Laws hath Power to dispense with his own Laws. Laws are made of Common Events. Those benign Circumstances that happen rarely, are left to the Dispensative Grace of the Prince. Thirdly, As he is a Bishop, whatever Dispensative Power the ancient Ecclesiastical Ca|nons, or Edicts of Christian Emperors give to the Bishop of</HI> Rome <HI>within those Territories that were subject to his Iurisdiction by Humane right, we do not envy him: so he suffer us to enjoy our ancient Privileges and Immunities freed from his Encroachments and Usurpations. <HI>The Chief ground of the ancient Ecclesiastical Canon was, let the old Customs prevail. A possession or Prescription of Eleven hundred years is a good ward both in Law and Conscience against an Human Right, and much more against a New pretence of Divine Right.</HI> For Eleven hundred years our Kings and Bi|shops enjoy'd the sole Dispensative Power with all English Laws, Civil and Ecclesiastical. In all which time he is not able to give one instance of a Papal Dispensation in</HI> England, <HI>nor any shadow of it when the Church was formed. Where the Bishops of</HI> Rome <HI>had no Legislative Power, no Iudiciary Power in the exteriour Court, by necessary Consequence they could have no Dispensative Power.</HI> He then in <HI>p.</HI> 169. mentions the said <HI>Statute</HI> of 25. <HI>H. 8th.</HI> and having referr'd to the <HI>Proviso,</HI> there to shew, that <HI>its intent was not to vary from the Church of Christ in any other things declared by the Holy Scripture, and the Word of God necessary to Sal|vation,</HI> he saith <HI>then followeth the scope of our Reformation; only to make an Ordinance by Policies necessary and convenient to repress Vice, and for good Conservation of the Realm in Peace, Unity and Tranquillity from ravine, and spoil, ensuing much the ancient Customs of this Realm in that behalf: not minding to seek for any relief, succours, or remedies for any worldly things, and Humane Laws in any cause of necessity, but within this Realm at the hands of your Highness, your Heirs and Successors Kings of this Realm, which have and ought to have an Imperial Power and Authority in the same, and not obli|ged in worldly Causes to any other Superior.</HI></P>
<P>Thus then you see this <HI>Prelates</HI> sense of how much the taking away the Pope's <HI>Dispensative</HI> Power here, and <HI>restoring</HI> that Power to the <HI>Crown,</HI> was the <HI>Soul</HI> of the <HI>Reformation,</HI> and <HI>tota</HI> in <HI>toto</HI> of it. And this <HI>Act</HI> you see revived by the <HI>First</HI> of <HI>Elizabeth</HI> without garbling it in the least; and the <HI>Dispensative</HI> Power thereby restored to her, her Heirs and Successors, and a <HI>Declaration, <HI>that no Subjects of the Realm need for any worldly things and Humane Laws in any Cause of Necessity seek for any relief, but within this Realm at the hands of our Soveraign,</HI></HI> as aforesaid. And I shall tell you that the <HI>Bishop</HI> in the next <HI>Page</HI> refers to the <HI>Sta|tute</HI> of the <HI>First</HI> of <HI>Eliz.</HI> and saith on his <HI>view</HI> of both <HI>Statutes, Whatsoever Power our Laws did devest the Pope of, they invested the King with it.</HI> And of this, the Power of <HI>Rehabilitating</HI> any of his <HI>Lay</HI> or <HI>Clerical</HI> Subjects is a part, as was beforesaid.</P>

<P>You have cited somewhat out of this Great <HI>Champion</HI> for the <HI>King's</HI> Supremacy, and for the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> and reputed to be the most clear <HI>Vindicator</HI> of it from <HI>Schism</HI> our Church hath had, which hath created more anxiety in my mind about the <HI>Assertory</HI> part of the <HI>Oath</HI> then any thing hath done.

<P>You judge right of the <HI>Bishop's</HI> Opinion, and which is indeed ex|press'd throughout his whole Book. He tells us in <HI>p.</HI> 25. <HI>That St.</HI> Cyprian <HI>made all the Bishopricks in the World to be but one Masse, whereof every Bi|shop had an entire part:</HI> And he saith in <HI>p.</HI> 60, and 61. <HI>That neither King</HI> Harry <HI>the</HI> 8th, <HI>nor any of our Legislators did ever endeavour to deprive the Bishop of</HI> Rome <HI>of the Power of the Keys, or any part thereof; either the Key of Order, or the Key of Iurisdiction: I mean Iurisdiction purely Spiri|tual which hath place only in the inner Court of Conscience, and over such Per|sons as submit willingly:</HI> And in the clearing of which Point he refers to the <HI>Proviso</HI> aforesaid in the <HI>Statute</HI> of the <HI>25th</HI> of <HI>Harry</HI> the <HI>8th,</HI> and the <HI>37th <HI>Canon</HI></HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> as rendring the <HI>Power</HI> by <HI>both</HI> given to the King to be purely <HI>Political.</HI> But in <HI>p.</HI> 159. he refers by way of <HI>Objection</HI> to two <HI>Statutes</HI> of <HI>Harry</HI> the 8th, the one an Act <HI>for extinguishing the Authority of the Bishop of</HI> Rome, the other <HI>an Act for Establishing the Succession,</HI> wherein there is an <HI>Oath,</HI> that <HI>the Bishop of</HI> Rome <HI>OUGHT not to have any Iurisdiction or Authority in this Realm;</HI> then faith it is declared in the 37th <HI>Article</HI> of our Church, <HI>that the Bishop of</HI> Rome <HI>hath no Iurisdiction in the Kingdom of</HI> England: and in the <HI>Oath</HI> ordain'd by <HI>Queen</HI> Elizabeth, <HI>that no Foreign Preiate hath or ought to have any Iu|risdiction or Authority Ecclesiastical or Spiritual within this Realm:</HI> and he then by way of answer to which, says <HI>That those two&punc; Statutes were long ago repeal'd by Queen</HI> Mary, <HI>and never afterward restored,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and that altho it were supposed that our Ancestors <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ad over-reach'd themselves and the truth in some Expressions, yet that concerns not us&punc; at all, so long as we keep our selves exactly to the line and level of Apostolical Tradition:</HI> and saith, that <HI>our Ancestors meant the very same thing that we do. Our only difference is in the use of the words, <HI>Spiritual Authority or Iurisdiction,</HI> which we understand of Iurisdiction purely Spiritual which extends <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">o fur|ther then the Court of Conscience. But by <HI>Spiritual Authority or Iuris|diction,</HI> they did understand Ecclesiostical Iurisdiction in the exterior Court, which in truth is partly Spiritual, partly Political.</HI> And he in <HI>p.</HI> 161. takes notice of the <HI>Apostles <HI>Dispensative</HI> Power,</HI> 2 Cor. 2. 10. <HI>to whom I for|gave any thing for your sakes, forgave I in the person of Christ: <HI>But all this is only in the interior Court of Conscience.</HI></HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>Primate</HI> having in <HI>p.</HI> 73. discours'd of the <HI>Act&punc;</HI> of 1^o <HI>Eliz.</HI> c. 1. saith, <HI>here is no new Power created in the Crown, but only an ancient Iuris|diction restored; here is no foreign Power abolish'd, but only that which is repugnant to the ancient Laws of</HI> England, <HI>and the Prerogative Royal. In a word, here is no Power ascribed to our Kings, but merely Political and Co|active to see that all their Subjects do their Duties in their several Places. Coactive Power is one of the Keys of the Kingdom of this World; it is none of the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven.

<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>The <HI>Primate</HI> hath shewn an eminent <HI>Candour</HI> of mind in these <HI>Passa|ges</HI> of his you have cited: and <HI>if our Ancestors had but over-reach'd them|selves, and the truth in some Expressions,</HI> and in any part of a <HI>Statute</HI> but that which <HI>forms</HI> an <HI>Oath,</HI> it had not <HI>much concern'd us, and as long as they had kept exactly to the line and level of</HI> plain Truth in <HI>all</HI> the words of the <HI>Oath:</HI> but <HI>Oaths</HI> being <HI>stricti juris,</HI> and being to be taken <HI>in truth and in righteousness,</HI> and in the common <HI>sense</HI> of the words, may I not here to the <HI>Assertory</HI> Clause of <HI>No foreign Prelate or Person hath or ought to have any Iurisdiction,</HI> &amp;c. apply those other words of the Primate, <HI>This might have been express'd in words less subject to Exception?</HI> But according to what he <HI>cited</HI> out of St. <HI>Cyprian,</HI> it may be said instead of <HI>no foreign Pre|late hath or ought to have any Iurisdiction,</HI> &amp;c. that <HI>Every foreign Prelate hath it,</HI> and not only the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> as claiming a Succession under St. <HI>Peter,</HI> but Thousands of other Bishops in Christendom; who as the <HI>Primate</HI> saith there, <HI>p.</HI> 162. <HI>do not at all derive their Holy Orders from S.</HI> Peter, <HI>or any other Roman Bishop, either mediately, or immediately (espe|cially in</HI> Asia <HI>and</HI> Africa) <HI>but from the other Apostles.</HI></P>
<P>And suitably to what the <HI>Primate</HI> observ'd out of <HI>S. Cyprian,</HI> by which we see that as <HI>there is but one Universal Church, so there is but</HI> Episcopatus Unus <HI>in that Church</HI> and that <HI>undivided,</HI> I find it observ'd in Sir <HI>Geffery Palmer's Reports</HI> in <HI>the Case of <HI>Evans &amp; Kiffin. vers. Ascuith.</HI></HI> Trin. 3. Car. <HI>B. R. Whitelock. Evesque ad</HI> 3 <HI>Powers. Le Primer est Ordinations: and that comes to him by his Consecration, and not before. By that he can take the resignation of a Church. He can give Orders and Consecrate Churches: and it belongs not to him as he is a Bishop of one place or other,</HI> mais il est universel sur tout le monde. <HI>And therefore the Archbishop of</HI> Spalato <HI>when he was here could give Orders. The Chief Iustice agreed with him herein. The second is</HI> Potestas Jurisdictionis <HI>which is not Universal, but tied to cer|tain places, as to take an Oath, to Excommunicate and Punish offences, and this Power he hath by Confirmation. The third is</HI> Administratio rei Fami|liaris, <HI>the Government of his Revenue, and this is gain'd by Confirmation.</HI> By this you see that the Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> as every other <HI>foreign</HI> Bishop, may have some <HI>Spiritual</HI> Power here, <HI>viz.</HI> what the <HI>Reporter</HI> mention'd as the first. And therefore I could wish that the 37th of our 39 <HI>Articles</HI> to which the <HI>Primate</HI> refers for the <HI>Interpretations</HI> of this <HI>Clause</HI> in the <HI>Oath,</HI> had in those words there <HI>the Bishop of</HI> Rome <HI>hath no Iurisdiction in this Realm,</HI> express'd such a <HI>distinction</HI> of his <HI>Iurisdiction</HI> as the <HI>Bishop</HI> hath done: and otherwise that common and trite Rule of <HI>Non est distinguendum ubi lex non distinguit,</HI> being here applicable, you know what is to be thought of an <HI>am|biguous</HI> Oath; and that as the sagacious Author of <HI>the History of the Coun|cil of</HI> Trent hath told us, <HI>p.</HI> 187, <HI>as one Particular makes false the contra|dictory Universal, so one ambiguous Particular, makes the Universal to be ambiguous.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover tho you will suppose that he might lawfully take the <HI>Oath</HI> in his <HI>sense</HI> of the Pope's Jurisdiction, yet all his great Learning and Reason could not qualifie him to be an <HI>Authentical</HI> Interpreter of the <HI>Oath</HI> to me. In some parts of the <HI>Oath</HI> that were obvious to <HI>doubt,</HI> you have already given me satisfaction, and particularly in making me by vertue of the <HI>Canons</HI> of King <HI>Iames</HI> a <HI>participant</HI> with the <HI>Clergy</HI> in his authentical <HI>Inter|pretation</HI> of the 37th <HI>Article.</HI> And since as <HI>Suarez</HI> in his learned Book, <HI>De Legibus,</HI> 4. c. <HI>de Interpretatione humanarum Legum,</HI> saith that <HI>there may be an interpretation of Law which hath the Authority of Law,</HI> and that <HI>qui in eadem potestate succedit, semper potest Praedecessotum leges interpretari,</HI> I shall account King <HI>Iames</HI> his <HI>Interpretation</HI> as good as Queen <HI>Elizabeth's:</HI>
<PB N="72" REF="40">
and that if he had there declared his mind about the Pope's <HI>spiritual</HI> Power <HI>in foro interno,</HI> being not <HI>renounced</HI> by this <HI>Clause</HI> in the <HI>Oath,</HI> I should then be content with it. But 'tis otherwise: for he there Confirms it in effect as 'tis in the <HI>Article.</HI></P>
<P>Now you know how much <HI>Simplicity</HI> becomes an <HI>Oath,</HI> and how requi|site it is that it should be conceiv'd in plain and <HI>liquid</HI> terms, and taken in the Imposer's sense and without <HI>mental</HI> reservations, and that you should Swear therein to no <HI>dogmatical</HI> Assertion; and as to which Mr. <HI>Nye</HI> saith well in his <HI>Observations on that Oath, to swear positively to any dogmatical Assertion is not required. It would be a taking the Name of God in vain: for if it be a certain and undoubted truth in it self and to others, as are Principles of Reason and Articles of Faith, an Oath is vain, for it ends no strife. If doubtful and a question whether true or not, tho such an Oath puts it out of question that I believe so, yet not that it is a truth. My belief, tho never so much evidenced and confirm'd, doth not make a doubtful matter in it self more credible; nor is one man's believing an Assertion just ground for another man to believe the same. Such an Oath therefore is in vain, and not a fit</HI> Medium <HI>to end such a Controversy.</HI></P>
<P>Now how far your <HI>declaring</HI> in your <HI>Oath</HI> that <HI>no foreign Prela<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e hath nor ought to have any Iurisdiction Spiritual within this Realm,</HI> and the In|terpretation of it <HI>pursuant</HI> to the 37th <HI>Article</HI> delivering the Plain words, <HI>The Bishop of Rome hath no Iurisdiction,</HI> &amp;c. may bring you within the <HI>Verge</HI> of <HI>swearing</HI> what is <HI>dogmatical,</HI> I leave you to judge: but shall take the liberty to tell you, that when I see some of our <HI>Laws,</HI> and particu|larly this about our <HI>Oath <HI>girdled</HI></HI> with so many <HI>Interpretations</HI> like new <HI>tender-sided</HI> Ships, I shall be apt to take little pleasure in embarquing my Conscience in such an <HI>Oath,</HI> and am apt to call to mind the <HI>Censure</HI> which Mr. <HI>Milton's Character of the Long Parliament of</HI> 40. fulminates against his Countrymen, and by which he so much disables our understandings as to Political Government; and saith, <HI>that the Sun which we want, ripens Wits as well as Fruits, and as Wine and Oyl are imported to us from abroad, so must ripe understanding,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P>But however, tho our <HI>Wine</HI> and <HI>Oyl</HI> are imported to us from abroad, our <HI>Dispensations</HI> are not, and we have no Occasion to send <HI>Gold</HI> to <HI>Rome</HI> for <HI>Lead:</HI> And I assure you, he who shall consider that the English <HI>Vir|tuosi</HI> were the <HI>last</HI> that did receive the yokes of the old <HI>Imperial</HI> and later <HI>Papal</HI> Power of <HI>Rome,</HI> and the <HI>first</HI> that threw them off, will tho we are <HI>Crasso sub a&euml;re nati,</HI> have no cause to vilifie our understandings, but ra|ther to envy their triumphs over Infallibility so call'd. And perhaps when I shall have told you of another passage of the <HI>Bishop,</HI> P. 59. in his <HI>Schism guarded,</HI> you will think the Eyes of our Ancestors understandings did look out sharp when the two <HI>Statutes</HI> of the <HI>25th</HI> of <HI>H.</HI> 8. and 1^o <HI>Eliz.</HI> were made; and there he saith, <HI>Suppose any of our Reformers have run into any Excesses or Extremes, either in their Expressions, or perhaps in their Actions (it is a difficult thing in great changes to observe a just mean) it may be out of Humane Frailty, as</HI> Lycurgus <HI>out of hatred to Drunken|ness cut down all the Vines about</HI> Sparta, <HI>or it may be out of Policy, as men use to bend a Crooked rod as much the contrary way, or as expert Masters of Musick do sometimes draw up their Scholars a Note too high, to bring them to a just tone, what is that to us as long as we practice the Mean and maintain the Mean, and guide our selves by the certain line and level of Apostolical and Primitive Tradition?</HI></P>
<P>There is no doubt but in the <HI>framing</HI> of the <HI>Statute</HI> of 1^o <HI>Eliz.</HI> and the <HI>Oath</HI> therein, regard was had to the <HI>Oath</HI> in the <HI>35th</HI> of <HI>H.</HI> 8. c. 1. viz.
<PB N="73" REF="40">
<HI>I having now the veil of Darkness of the Usurped Power, Authority and Iurisdiction of the See and Bishops of</HI> Rome <HI>clearly taken away from mine Eyes, do utterly testify and declare in my Conscience, that neither the See nor the Bishop of</HI> Rome, <HI>nor any foreign Potentate hath nor ought to have any Iurisdiction, Power or Authority within this Realm, neither by God's Law, nor any other just Law or means,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and that I shall never consent nor agree that the aforesaid See or Bi|shop of</HI> Rome, <HI>or their Successors, shall exercise or have any manner of Authority, Iurisdiction or Power within this Realm,</HI> &amp;c. And this Oath remain'd the same all the rest of his Reign, and all <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>6th</HI>'s time: and as to which Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> changed the Expression of <HI>Supreme Head:</HI> and both <HI>Harry</HI> the 8th, and <HI>She</HI> having their Eyes on the effect of <HI>Papal</HI> Excommunications, and concern'd to have the <HI>nullity</HI> of them believed by their Subjects, might seem according to the <HI>Primate's</HI> Expres|sion <HI>to bend the crooked rod of the</HI> Papal <HI>Iurisdiction overmuch the contra|ry way in their Oaths,</HI> that so it might come to that just straitness referr'd to according to the <HI>Primate's</HI> measures of it.</P>
<P>But after all I shall tell you, that I think no <HI>Political</HI> respects can justifie the putting <HI>doubtful</HI> Expressions into an <HI>Oath,</HI> or the <HI>taking</HI> of one with <HI>mental</HI> reservations of a <HI>sense</HI> different from the <HI>Common</HI> one of the words, and I do therefore joyn <HI>issue</HI> with you in the Point, that the <HI>Clause</HI> in the <HI>Oath, <HI>That no foreign Prelate hath or ought to have any Iurisdiction,</HI></HI> &amp;c. being the very <HI>same</HI> in the 37th <HI>Article,</HI> (and in the <HI>Interpretation</HI> of which <HI>Article,</HI> King <HI>Iames</HI> his <HI>Canons</HI> have, as you said, made you a <HI>sharer</HI> with the <HI>Clergy</HI>) you and all others who <HI>take</HI> the <HI>Oath</HI> may be thankful for the <HI>benefit</HI> of that <HI>King,</HI> having <HI>further</HI> exercised the <HI>Dispensative</HI> Power of his <HI>interpreting</HI> the whole intent of that <HI>Oath:</HI> And that <HI>Inter|pretation</HI> of it which hath made the <HI>Coast</HI> of the Oath <HI>clear</HI> to you in this Point, you will find agreeing to what he hath in our Language <HI>Publish'd</HI> to the World, and dedicated to eternity. For he having in his <HI>Premonition to all Christian Monarchs</HI> mention'd how <HI>he caus'd the House of Commons to Reform a Clause they had put into the Oath of Allegiance derogatory to the Pope's spiritual Power,</HI> viz. <HI>That the Pope had no Power to Excommunicate him, and that he was ready to consent that the Bishop of</HI> Rome <HI>should have the first Seat, and be Patriarch of the West, and be</HI> Primus Episcopus inter omnes Episcopos &amp; princeps Episcoporum, <HI>so it be no otherwise but as</HI> Peter <HI>was, Princeps Apostolorum,</HI> takes occasion in his <HI>Apology</HI> for the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Allegiance</HI> to let the <HI>World</HI> know his <HI>Royal</HI> judgment of the <HI>intent</HI> of the <HI>OATH</HI> of <HI>SUPREMACT;</HI> and there in <HI>Confutation</HI> of the Pope's <HI>Breves,</HI> and <HI>Bellarmine's</HI> Letter, he saith in <HI>p.</HI> 108. that <HI>the rendring Christian Kings within their own Dominions, Governors of their Church as well as of the rest of their People, in being <HI>Custodes utriusque tabulae,</HI> not by making new Articles of Faith,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>but by commanding Obedience to be given to the Word of God, by reforming Religion according to his prescribed Will, by assisting the Spiritual Power with the Temporal Sword, by reforming Corrup|tions, by procuring due Obedience to the Church, by judging and cutting off all frivolous Questions and Schisms as</HI> Constantine <HI>did, and finally by making</HI> decorum <HI>to be observ'd in every thing, and establishing Orders to be observ'd in all indifferent things for that purpose, is the ONLY <HI>intent of the Oath of Supremacy:</HI></HI> and whereby as he effectually <HI>confuted</HI> the <HI>Cardinal,</HI> whose <HI>Letter</HI> charged the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Supremacy</HI> as tending to this end, <HI>That the Au|thority of the Head of the Church in</HI> England <HI>may be transferr'd from the Successor of St.</HI> Peter <HI>to the Successor of King</HI> Henry <HI>the 8th, and to oppose the Primacy of the Apostolick See;</HI> so at the <HI>end</HI> of his <HI>Book</HI> he shews that

<P>I hope you have now put a <HI>Period</HI> to the <HI>History</HI> of the <HI>Dispensative</HI> Power of the Crown, that was exercised in-the <HI>interpreting</HI> of any <HI>parts</HI> of the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Supremacy,</HI> or the 37th <HI>Article</HI> thereto relating. You have named to me so many <HI>interpretations</HI> of the <HI>Oath,</HI> that according to the wisdom of our State, and the <HI>Lex &amp; Consuetudo Parliamenti</HI> making a <HI>Bill</HI> to be thrice read in each <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Parliament,</HI> and then receiving the <HI>Royal</HI> Assent to be thought like <HI>Gold</HI> seven times purify'd, may shew the <HI>interpretation</HI> of the <HI>Law</HI> to be so too. But tho I will account any good Law to be more precious then Gold, yet if like <HI>Gold</HI> it be too far extended by <HI>ductile</HI> interpretation, it may be drawn to such a thinness as to lose all its weight and estimation, and retain only a poor tincture and colour that will signifie little or nothing. And as <HI>Pliny</HI> in his <HI>Panegyrick</HI> on <HI>Trajan</HI> said, that by reason of the <HI>multitudes</HI> of sutes upon <HI>Penal</HI> Laws in <HI>Rome,</HI> there was danger till <HI>Trajan</HI>'s time, <HI>ne Civitas fundata legibus, legibus ever|teretur;</HI> so a Law whose Obligatoriness is founded on <HI>interpretations</HI> may be endanger'd by the multitudes of them to be destroy'd, and may like the <HI>Papal</HI> Laws of New <HI>Rome</HI> by the infinite interpretations of <HI>Casuists</HI> in the <HI>forum internum</HI> (which is their <HI>Tribunal</HI>) be brought to signifie nothing in either <HI>forum,</HI> and to be only an Engine to make Perplexities.</P>
<P>You have given me here such a <HI>Genealogy</HI> of <HI>interpretations,</HI> that accor|ding to the common <HI>Story</HI> of <HI>Arise Daughter,</HI> &amp;c. one may say, <HI>Arise In|terpretation, and go to thy Interpretation,</HI> &amp;c. I shall therefore be glad now you have been so largely communicative of your thoughts to me about the <HI>assertory</HI> part of the <HI>Oath,</HI> you will deal as <HI>frankly</HI> with me in ac|quainting me with what may in the <HI>Promissory</HI> part of the <HI>Oath</HI> be of im|portance for me to know in order to the better discharge of my Duty in the <HI>Case</HI> before me.</P>

<P>Nor did those of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> who convers'd with the <HI>Statute|Book</HI> want the Crown's <HI>interpretation</HI> of this <HI>Clause</HI> in the <HI>Oath;</HI> for the scope of the <HI>Statute</HI> of the 35th of <HI>H.</HI> the <HI>8th,</HI> that enjoyn'd the <HI>old</HI> Oath of <HI>Supremacy</HI> (and from whence this <HI>Clause</HI> in the <HI>New</HI> one had its <HI>rise</HI>) was not to break the Measures of St. <HI>Cyprian</HI> about the <HI>Unity</HI> of <HI>Episcopal</HI> Power, but in effect to repress the <HI>Usurp'd</HI> independent <HI>Coactive</HI> Power of the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> and which several of the following words in that <HI>Oath</HI> sufficiently evince, and which did bind the <HI>Swearer <HI>to defend and main|tain all other Acts and Statutes made or to be made within this Realm for the Extirpation and Extinguishment of the ururped and pretended Authority, Power and Iurisdiction of the See and Bishop of</HI></HI> Rome, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> finding the <HI>Oath</HI> thus, at her coming to the Throne, she like a <HI>wise</HI> Reformer, would not make any <HI>breach</HI> in the World <HI>wider</HI> then necessity required; and probably supposing that mens <HI>Allegiance</HI> ha|ving been used to the yoke of several words in <HI>that</HI> Oath that related to the <HI>renouncing</HI> and <HI>farsaking</HI> of <HI>foreign Iurisdiction,</HI> would draw more qui|etly in the same, and that according to the <HI>Rule</HI> of <HI>quod necessario subintelli|gitur non deest,</HI> there being no <HI>solutio continui</HI> imagin'd by any to be de|sign'd in the <HI>Unity</HI> of the <HI>Episcopal</HI> Power, when the <HI>Clause</HI> of <HI>utterly testifying and declaring, that neither the See nor Bishop of Rome hath nor ought to have any Iurisdiction, Power or Authority within this</HI>

<P>But that the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> intended no War against the <HI>Unity</HI> of <HI>Episcopacy</HI> by the <HI>Canons</HI> of 1640.

Now there is as much difference between the See of</HI> Rome <HI>and the Church of</HI> Rome, <HI>as betwixt Treason and Trespass, and this appears plainly by the Sta|tute of</HI> 23. Eliz. c. 1. <HI>where it is said, that to be reconciled to the See of</HI> Rome <HI>is Treason: but to be reconciled to the Church of</HI> Rome <HI>is not Treason; for then every Papist would be a Traytor, being a Member of the Church, and therefore reconciled to it. Now the See of</HI> Rome <HI>is nothing else but the Pa|pacy or Supremacy of the Pope, whereby by virtue of the Canon,</HI> unam San|ctam, <HI>made by Pope</HI> Boniface <HI>the 8th, he challengeth a Superiority of Iuris|diction and Correction over all Kings and Princes upon Earth: and those Persons which take the</HI> juramentum fidei <HI>contain'd in the end of the Council of</HI> Trent, <HI>which acknowledgeth this Supremacy, are said to be reconciled to this See. The Church of</HI> Rome <HI>is nothing else but a number of Men within the Pope's Dominions and elsewhere professing the Religion of Poperty: and that the Clergy had an ill meaning in leaving this Clause in the Oath thus loose, I have some reason to imagine when I find it in their late Books, that they say the Church of</HI> Rome <HI>is a true Church, and Salvation is to be had in it.</HI></P>
<P>And if it were <HI>tanti</HI> after having said so much, to say yet any thing more to prop up the safety of your taking the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Supremacy</HI> with the <HI>Clause</HI> whose <HI>sense</HI> hath been propp'd up by so many Acts of the <HI>Dispensative</HI> Power of <HI>interpreting,</HI> I could tell you that in Sir <HI>Iohn Winter's Observa|tions</HI>

<P>But doth that <HI>Explanation</HI> of the <HI>Regal Power</HI> assert any thing in <HI>De|fence</HI> of the <HI>Dispensative</HI> part of it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>You see how without <HI>wyre-drawing</HI> any Consequences, the very first <HI>Paragraph</HI> of the <HI>Explanation</HI> doth both strengthen the foundation of the <HI>assertory</HI> part of your <HI>Oath,</HI> we have been so long discussing, and strike out new lights in the Fabrick of the <HI>Oath.</HI> You see it tells you <HI>downright,</HI> that <HI>A Supreme Power is given to the Order of Kings by God himself in the Scriptures, which is that Kings should rule and Command in their several Dominions, all Persons of what rank or estate soever,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And the <HI>Explanation</HI> doth effectually enough provide by the second <HI>Pa|ragraph</HI> that Kings should take care that none in their Dominions <HI>but the stubborn and evil doers may be restrain'd with the Temporal Sword:</HI> for it saith, <HI>The Care of God's&punc; Church is so committed to Kings in the Scripture, that they are commended when the Church keeps the right way, and taxed when it runs amiss: and therefore her Govern|ment belongs in chief to Kings. For otherwise one man would be Com|mended for another's Care, and taxed but for another's Negligence, which is not God's way.</HI> And this is an <HI>Argument</HI> taken <HI>ab absurdo,</HI> and the strongest that can be used in Law, and not to be set aside but by the <HI>alledg|ing</HI> something as <HI>more</HI> absurd against it; and amounts to this, that it is <HI>absurd</HI> that <HI>Kings</HI> who are <HI>commended,</HI> when those who are not <HI>stubborn</HI> nor <HI>evil doers</HI> are not under any <HI>restraint</HI> by the <HI>Temporal Sword</HI> (for <HI>the Church runs</HI> not <HI>the right way,</HI> when that <HI>Sword</HI> is a <HI>terror</HI> to <HI>any</HI> but <HI>evil doers</HI>) and <HI>tax'd</HI> on the <HI>contrary</HI> being done, should not be judged to be authorized to <HI>exempt</HI> those from all <HI>restraint</HI> thereby. And when the People are not liable to blame for Kings erring in their Judgment about the Per|sons to be so exempted from restraint, nor to be commended or rewarded for their not erring therein; can any thing be more <HI>absurd,</HI> then for the
<PB N="79" REF="43">
<HI>independent Coactive</HI> Power of Kings it self to be <HI>restrain'd</HI> to the Punishing such as they shall judge <HI>Innocent?</HI></P>
<P>But the two <HI>tenderest</HI> things in the World are <HI>Sovereign</HI> Power and <HI>Con|science,</HI> and both of them were made with a <HI>Godly Iealousie</HI> and <HI>tenderness</HI> to <HI>support</HI> one another; and that Tender-Conscienced <HI>Prince</HI> who <HI>confirm'd</HI> this <HI>Canon,</HI> did in it variously <HI>dispensare in lege,</HI> as I may properly say with <HI>Allusion</HI> to <HI>Suarez de Legibus,</HI> where in stead of using the <HI>Common</HI> Expres|sion of <HI>dispensing WITH Laws</HI> he so frequently mentions <HI>that</HI> of <HI>dispensing IN them,</HI> and thereby doth seem to take off somewhat of the harshness of Questions about <HI>Popes</HI> or <HI>Princes dispensing WITH Laws.</HI> For when <HI>Sove|reigns</HI> do <HI>dispensare in lege,</HI> they really <HI>distribute</HI> their Sovereign Power throughout the Body of their respective Laws for their Preservation, and as the <HI>heart</HI> doth dispense or <HI>distribute</HI> Blood in and throughout the Body|natural, and the Brain <HI>Animal</HI> Spirits throughout the <HI>genus nervosum</HI> all the Body over. And here the King having a <HI>tender</HI> regard to the <HI>firm</HI> and <HI>infirm</HI> Consciences of his People respectively, and to their various Capaci|ties of understanding, and he being as <HI>Zealous</HI> for all their <HI>keeping</HI> their <HI>Oaths</HI> of <HI>Supremacy</HI> and <HI>Allegiance,</HI> as any Prince could be for their <HI>taking</HI> them, doth in the beginning of the <HI>Canon,</HI> let such as you know (who have been brought up to Study, and who have a <HI>tenacious</HI> Memory, and could remember more <HI>interpretations</HI> of the <HI>Oath</HI> then I have recounted to you if they had been given by our Princes) that <HI>whereas sundry Laws, Ordi|nances and Constitutions have been formerly made for the acknowledg|ment and profession of the most lawful and independent Authority of our Dread Sovereign Lord the King's most Excellent Majesty over the State Ecclesiastical and Civil,</HI> &amp;c <HI>he doth enjoyn them all to be care|fully observ'd by all such Persons whom they concern upon the Penalties in the said Laws express.</HI></P>
<P>Here then the <HI>Acts of Parliament</HI> before-mention'd, and the <HI>Oaths,</HI> and <HI>Articles,</HI> and <HI>Canons,</HI> and <HI>Authentick interpretations</HI> appear to look you in the face, and the <HI>Articles</HI> particularly do so to the <HI>Clergy</HI> as having sub|scribed them. But that Pious <HI>Prince</HI> as their <HI>Sovereign</HI> Pastor, being desi|rous that his <HI>Clergy</HI> should <HI>gently</HI> allure the <HI>Layety</HI> with <HI>Line upon Line, and Precept upon Precept</HI> to keep their <HI>Faith</HI> to God, and <HI>Loyalty</HI> to himself, rather then by <HI>Interpretation upon Interpretation</HI> of their <HI>Oaths,</HI> would not in this <HI>Canon</HI> have them frighted with the sight of the <HI>Oaths</HI> themselves, and which are there not named: and all <HI>Archbishops, Bishops,</HI> and inferior <HI>Priests</HI> are moreover by the <HI>Canon</HI> required to <HI>Preach, Teach, and Ex|hort their people to obey, honour, and serve their King, and that they presume not to speak of his Majesty's Power any other way then in this Canon is exoress'd;</HI> but which <HI>Canon</HI> gives them a very fair <HI>licence</HI> to <HI>speak</HI> to their People <HI>of</HI> and <HI>for</HI> the <HI>King's</HI> Power of <HI>disabling</HI> and of <HI>rehabi|litating</HI> his Subjects.

<P>But if you will take Mr. <HI>Bagshaw</HI>'s word in his first <HI>Argument</HI> in <HI>Parlia|ment</HI> concerning the <HI>Canons,</HI> he there tells you that that very <HI>Canon</HI> of the Convocation containing <HI>the Explanation of the Regal Power,</HI> did necessarily imply their declared sense of the Laws being dispens'd with: For saith he, <HI>in making Determinations concerning Royal Power, they have done against Law, and have medled with things of which they have no Conusance: for the Exposi|tion of them belongs to the Iudges of the Land, and they have no more right to expound them, then the Iudges have to expound Texts of Scripture.</HI></P>
<P>And we know that our Laws have been so careful of preserving the Judges right of <HI>interpreting</HI> them, that they allow not the Bishops and their Officials Power to interpret any Acts of Parliament, tho made about Mat|ters of their Jurisdiction, and Matters merely <HI>Spiritual:</HI> as appears out of <HI>Hobart.</HI> 84. <HI>Spenloe's Case,</HI> and <HI>Coke</HI> 3. <HI>Inst.</HI> where he saith, that an <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> made about things merely <HI>Spiritual</HI> shall be <HI>construed</HI> by the Common Law <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> Judges.</P>

<HI>Preheminence, Power and Iurisdiction Royal unto the name of King, but also do give, assign and appoint the Correction and Punish|ment of all Offenders against the Regality and Dignity of the Crown, and the Laws of this Realm unto the King,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And considering that a Popish <HI>Parliament</HI> of Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s did give this their august Declarative sense of the <HI>executive</HI> Power, of <HI>punishing all Of|fenders against the Regality and Dignity of the Crown</HI> (which is the great <HI>Offence</HI> taken at Popery) <HI>and the Laws of the Realm,</HI> as <HI>belonging</HI> to or inhe|rent in our Kings by virtue of their being <HI>Supreme Governors <HI>of the Realm,</HI></HI> and that this <HI>Supreme</HI> Power was <HI>Committed to her and her Progenitors by the Divine Providence of Almighty God,</HI> shall your acknowledgments of such <HI>Supreme</HI> Power of your Prince be narrower then any of <HI>Papists?</HI></P>
<P>You know how wary and careful our <HI>English</HI> Princes have always been that their Subjects might see them hold the reins of the Executive Power of the Law in their hands, and that none but the <HI>stubborn</HI> and <HI>evil doers</HI> need fear the being over-run by it.</P>
<P>And while I happen to think of the memorable <HI>Expression</HI> of a Loyal <HI>Lord</HI> in a <HI>Speech</HI> in a late <HI>Parliament</HI> of the <HI>unreasonableness</HI> of any ones suffering merely by the word <HI>Proditori&egrave;</HI> being put into the charge of a thing that was not in its self <HI>Evil,</HI> and <HI>as if it were said that such an one did</HI> traiterously <HI>pass over the Thames in a Boat:</HI> I likewise think of the <HI>reasona|bleness</HI> of our <HI>Laws</HI> in providing for the common <HI>Safety</HI> by the <HI>Prince</HI> be|ing allow'd to <HI>hold</HI> the <HI>Sail</HI> of the <HI>Executive</HI> Power in his own hands, and which otherwise if ty'd fast about the Boat might cause it upon any sudden gust of wind to be overset.</P>
<P>You know therefore how King <HI>Iames</HI> the First in his <HI>Apology for the Oath of Allegiance,</HI> in <HI>Answer</HI> to the <HI>Pope's first Breve,</HI> thought himself obliged in <HI>justice</HI> for the maintenance of that <HI>Executive</HI> Power of the Crown to say as to <HI>the Pope's expressing his sorrow for that Persecution which the Catholicks sustain for the Faiths sake, wherein beside the main untruth whereby I am so injuriously used</HI> (as if he had thought it a personal injury to himself that any one in his Realm should be persecuted for Religion) <HI>I must ever avow and maintain as the truth is, according to mine own knowledge, that the late QUEEN of famous Memory never PUNISH'D any Papist for Religion.</HI> He doth not say, <HI>her Laws,</HI> and <HI>Ministers,</HI> but <HI>SHE never punish'd,</HI> &amp;c. He well knew that if <HI>Papists</HI> had been <HI>Punish'd</HI> for their <HI>Religion</HI> in <HI>her</HI> Reign by <HI>Iudges,</HI> and <HI>Iuries,</HI> and <HI>Sheriffs,</HI> that it was <HI>she</HI> had <HI>punish'd</HI> them.

<P>Well, Sir, In fine I leave it to you to consider on the whole matter how far the Contents of that Canon, and particularly what is declared therein about <HI>the care of God's Church being so committed to Kings in the Scripture, that they are commended when the Church keeps the right way, and blamed when it runs amiss, and therefore her Government belongs in chief to Kings,</HI> &amp;c. do shew that Kings not only may, but ought out of a regard to their own Souls to provide that where the <HI>safety</HI> of their Subjects <HI>Souls</HI> is concern'd, their <HI>Dispensative</HI> Power by the <HI>interpretation</HI> of their Laws, and the <HI>relaxation</HI> of their <HI>Rigour</HI> in particular Cases may be exerted.</P>

<P>I could tell you of another passage in his Reign that will shew you how our <HI>Bishops</HI> made use of that Power as their <HI>Sheat Anchor</HI> to preserve the <HI>Hierarchy</HI> in the <HI>Storms</HI> it met with: and how then the <HI>Bishops</HI> issuing out the <HI>Processes</HI> of their <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> Courts in their <HI>own</HI> Names, was by the Artifice of the <HI>Faction</HI> improved as an occasion of making a very great <HI>ferment</HI> in Church and State, and such a one as nothing but the <HI>Royal</HI> Power of <HI>Interpretation,</HI> or of <HI>declaring</HI> the <HI>Law,</HI> could settle.</P>
<P>And therefore Archbishop <HI>Laud</HI> in his <HI>Epistle</HI> to the <HI>King</HI> before his fa|mous <HI>Star-Chamber Speech,</HI> did <HI>in the Name of the Church of</HI> England then think himself obliged to apply to the King in a most pathetical and solemn manner to exert that great <HI>Power</HI> in that Conjuncture: viz. <HI>I do humbly in the Churches name desire of your Majesty, that it may be resolv'd by all the Reverend Iudges of</HI> England, <HI>and then Publish'd by your Majesty, that our keeping Courts and issuing Process in our own Names, and the like Exceptions formerly taken and now renew'd, are not against the Laws of the Realm (as 'tis most certain they are not) that so the Church Governors may go on cheer|fully in their Duty, and the Peoples minds be quieted by this assurance, that neither the Law, nor their liberty as Subjects is infringed thereby.</HI></P>
<P>The many <HI>Pamphleteers</HI> of the <HI>Faction</HI> who attacqued the <HI>Hierarchy,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">eproached them with the <HI>Non-observance</HI> of <HI>Humane</HI> Laws, and charged their Proceedings with <HI>Illegality,</HI> because by the <HI>Statute</HI> of 1^o <HI>E.</HI> 6. c. 2. that required <HI>Processes</HI> Ecclesiastical to be in the <HI>King's</HI> name, it was de|clar'd, <HI>That the Bishops sending out their Process in their own Names was con|trary</HI>
<PB N="84" REF="46">
<HI>to the Form and Order of the Summons and Process of the Common-Law used in this Realm.</HI> And therefore as <HI>Heylin</HI> tells us in the Life of Arch|bishop <HI>Laud,</HI> p. 321. in <HI>A.</HI> 1637. the <HI>King</HI> accordingly <HI>issued out his Pro|clamation declaring, That the Bishops holding their Courts, and issuing Pro|cess in their own Names were not against the Laws of the Realm, and the Iudges Resolutions were therein notify'd to that purpose.</HI> And upon all mo|tions afterward for <HI>Prohibitions</HI> to the Ecclesiastical Court upon the pretence of their <HI>Processes</HI> not issuing out in the <HI>King</HI>'s Name according to that <HI>Sta|tute</HI> of <HI>E.</HI> the 6th, the currant <HI>Law</HI> hath still been in <HI>Westminster-Hall</HI> for keeping up the sense of His Majesty <HI>declared</HI> in his <HI>Proclamation</HI> as to that Point.</P>
<P>According to the manner then of <HI>praising the Bridge we go over;</HI> the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> having in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s time been preserv'd by the Regal Power of <HI>interpreting</HI> express'd in her <HI>Admonition,</HI> and by the like Power in the time of King <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>First,</HI> and the <HI>salus animae</HI> having been at stake as to the <HI>Oath</HI> in her time, and as to the avowed Principle of the Church of <HI>England</HI> about <HI>Humane</HI> Laws <HI>binding</HI> the <HI>Conscience</HI> in his time; the use of that <HI>Dispensative</HI> Power being like a <HI>Bridge</HI> that kept them from falling into the <HI>Pit</HI> of <HI>Perdition,</HI> deserv'd their Praise.</P>
<P>That eminent Divine Mr. <HI>Iohn Ley</HI> in his Learn'd Book call'd <HI>Defensive Doubts and Reasons for refusal of the Oath imposed by the Sixth Canon of the late Synod,</HI> (i. e. that in the <HI>year</HI> 1640.) saith there, <HI>p.</HI> 99. and 100, &amp;c. <HI>There are some of our Brethren, who (in good will to themselves and us) have un|dertaken to expound the Oath so as that they and we without scruple may take it. And we take kindly their good intention, and in good will to them again request them to consider, that a Private Interpretation of a Publick Act can give no satisfaction unless it be either expresly or virtually allow'd by the highest Authority that doth impose it: and then it is made Publick,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>But the Authority of Interpretation of any doubt in such a Publick Act, be|longs properly not to private but publick Persons,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>For private Men tho Learn'd, if they take upon them the Interpretation of publick Dictates, may be more like to light on mutual Contradictions of each other, then on the true and proper Construction of the Text they interpret. So did</HI> Vega <HI>and</HI> Soto, Soto <HI>and</HI> Catherinus, <HI>who wrote against each other contrary Comments on the Council of</HI> Trent. <HI>In which respect it was a wise advice given to the Pope by the Bishop of</HI> Bestice, <HI>viz. to appoint a Congregation for the expounding of the Councel: and well follow'd by him when he forbade all sorts of Persons, Clerks or Laicks (being private Men) to make any Commentaries, Glosses, Annota|tions, or any Interpretation whatsoever on the Decrees of that Councel. Dr.</HI> Burgesse <HI>indeed made an Interpretation of his own Subscription, but there had been no validity in it (as we conceive) unless it had been allow'd by the Superior Powers. And so it was: for (as he saith). It was accep|ted by King</HI> James: <HI>and the Archbishop of</HI> Canterbury <HI>affirm'd it to be the true sense and meaning of the Church of</HI> England.

<PB N="85" REF="46">
<HI>father'd on the late King, and prefix'd to the Articles, had so much Power with his Printer, that he durst not alter the word <HI>Queen</HI> into <HI>King</HI> even in the year</HI> 1642, <HI>and those Articles must be read</HI> Verbatim <HI>without Alteration or Explanation, then we say again there is a Necessity of Reforming that Ar|ticle in the expression of it: and not to talk at random what was indeed the meaning, unless we may have leave when we read it</HI> (Regi&acirc; declaratione non-obstante) <HI>to declare the sense which the Declaration alloweth us not to do.</HI></P>
<P>But the truth is, that exception of the <HI>Doctor</HI> to the <HI>Articles</HI> may well pass for a <HI>Scruple,</HI> or rather a <HI>Cavil:</HI> and at this rate we should be put to it to say, <HI>O King interpret for ever.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>You say right. Dr. <HI>Pierson</HI> in that Judicious Book of his, call'd <HI>No Necessity of Reforming the Doctrine of the Church of</HI> England, well observes that the 37th <HI>Article hath express reference to the Queen's Injunctions set forth in the year</HI> 1559. <HI>and those Injunctions take particular care, <HI>that no other Duty, Allegiance, or Bond should be required to the Queen, then was acknowledged to be due to the most noble Kings of famous Memory, King</HI></HI> Henry the 8th <HI>her Majesty's Father, or King</HI> Edward the 6th, <HI>her Majesty's Brother. <HI>The words of the Article declare that the Doctrine contained in it, concerneth all the Kings as Kings. The title in General is of the Civil Magistrates, and the words run thus.,</HI> where we attribute to the Queen's Majesty the chief Government we give not to our Princes,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>shewing that what they gave to&punc; her, they gave to all the Kings of</HI> England. <HI>Which will appear more plainly out of the first Latine Copy Printed in the time of Queen</HI> Eliz. <HI>in the year</HI> 1563. <HI>read and approved by the Queen, the words where<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">f are these, <HI>Cum Regiae Majestati summam gubernationem tribuimus, quibus titulis intelligimus animos quorundam Calumnia|torum offendi, non damus Regibus nostris aut verbi Dei aut Sacra|mentorum administrationem,</HI></HI> &amp;c. <HI>Being therefore the Article expresly mentioneth and concerneth the Kings of</HI> England, <HI>as they are the Kings of</HI> England, <HI>the mention of the Queen's Majesty in the Article can make the Doctrine no more doubtful then it doth our Allegiance in that Oath which was made</HI> 1^o Eliz. <HI>where the Heirs and Successors of the Queen are to appoint who shall accept the Oath, the words of which are <HI>that the Queen's Highness is the only Supreme Governor of this Realm.</HI> But I hope the Heirs and Successors of Queen</HI> Elizabeth <HI>did never appoint that Oath to be taken in the Name of the Queen's Highness, but in their own.</HI></P>
<P>It may be supposed that some such like <HI>Cavilling</HI> or <HI>Scrupling</HI> humour possess'd the fancies of some in the beginning of the Reign of King <HI>Iames</HI> the First: and that some occasion was thereby given to that <HI>Prince</HI> in those his <HI>Canons, expresly</HI> therein maintaining the 39 <HI>Articles,</HI> and the Subscription thereunto, and particularly in the 36th <HI>Canon</HI> there to enjoyn a <HI>Subscription</HI> to <HI>three</HI> Articles <HI>in such manner and sort as is there appointed,</HI> and of which the <HI>first</HI> is, <HI>That the King's Majesty under God is the only Supreme Governor of this Realm, and of all other his Highness Do|minions,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and that no foreign Prince, Person, Prelate, HAUE or OUGHT to have any Iurisdiction, Power, Superiority, Prehemi|nence, or Authority Ecclesiastical or Spiritual,</HI> &amp;c. and in which the words <HI>have or OUGHT to have,</HI> might possibly be inserted out of a Royal Complaisance with the Desires of some <HI>Scruplers</HI> in whose behalf the Fa|mous Dr. <HI>Rainolds</HI> moved the King at the <HI>Hampton-Court Conference</HI> that to the Position in the 37th <HI>Article,</HI> viz. <HI>The Bishop of</HI> Rome <HI>hath no Iurisdiction in this Realm of</HI> England, <HI>might be added nor OUGHT to have:</HI> but which motion the King then rejected as a thing superfluous, and saying, <HI>Habemus quod jure habemus.</HI></P>

<P>Thus too as to the Queen's <HI>disabling</HI> several of the Roman-Catholick <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Deans</HI> by her Ecclesiastical <HI>Commissioners</HI> in the beginning of her Reign, pursuant to the <HI>Act</HI> of 1^o <HI>Eliz.</HI> c. 1. <HI>for restoring to the Crown the Ancient Iurisdiction;</HI> the <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> 35^o <HI>Eliz.</HI> c. 8. entituled, <HI>Every Deprivation of any Bishop or Dean made in the beginning of the Queen's Reign shall be good: and Archbishops, Bishops and Deans made by the Queen shall be adjudged lawful;</HI> begins with acknowledging that the former <HI>were justly deprived, <HI>and it is therefore Declared and Enacted by Authority of this Parliament, that all and every Deprivation,</HI></HI> &amp;c. <HI>and all and every Sentence of Deprivation,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>had, pronounced and given,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>shall be adjudged, deem'd, and taken good and sufficient in Law,</HI> &amp;c. and as to the latter, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>all such Archbishops, Bishops and Deans as were ordain'd or made by the Authority or Licence of the Queen's Majesty,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>shall be taken and adjudged to be lawful,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>And here too (by the way) I am to tell you, that you have <HI>another</HI> judgment of <HI>Parliament</HI> suitable to that in 8^o <HI>Eliz.</HI> and for the <HI>adjudging and taking to be Lawful the making and ordaining of the Archbishops and Bishops by the Authority or Licence of the Queen's Majesty,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>any am|biguity or question in that behalf heretofore made to the contrary not|withstanding,</HI> and which <HI>QUESTION</HI> before made in the Case, I have be|fore shew'd to be <HI>disability.</HI></P>

<P>But I suppose you have read of that <HI>TWO-FOLD Subscription</HI> my Lord <HI>Coke</HI> speaks of, represented as a <HI>Gravamen</HI> by some.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have so: and the last Book I read that so represents it is, the <HI>An|swer to Dr.</HI> Stillingfleet'<HI>s Sermon by some Non-Conformists,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Printed</HI> A. 1680. and where in <HI>p.</HI> 29. they thus express their desires, <HI>viz. That all New devised Oaths, Subscriptions and Declarations, together with the Cano|nical</HI>
<PB N="87" REF="47">
<HI>Oath, and the Subscription in the Canons be suspended for the time to come. If that be too much, we shall consent our selves with a modester mo|tion, that whatsoever these Declarations be that are required to be made, subscribed, or sworn, they may be imposed only as to the matter and end, leaving the takers but free to the use of their own Expressions. And this ex|pedient we gather from the Lord</HI> Coke, <HI>who hath providently (as it were) against such a Season laid in this Observation,</HI> The form of the Subscription set down in the Canons ratify'd by King <HI>Iames,</HI> was not express'd in the Act of the 13th of <HI>Eliz.</HI> 4. <HI>Inst.</HI> c. 74. <HI>And consequently if the Clergy enjoy'd this freedom till then, in reference to the particulars therein contain'd, what binders why they might not have the same restored in reference also to others?</HI></P>
<P>It was the second <HI>Article</HI> enjoyn'd by that Canon to be <HI>subscribed,</HI> viz. That <HI>the Book of Common-Prayer,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>containeth in it nothing contrary to the Word of God, and that it may lawfully be used,</HI> &amp;c. at which they took so much offence, and to which the <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> required not their Subscription.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I perceive then my Lord <HI>Coke</HI> doth not reflect on the <HI>form</HI> of <HI>Sub|scription,</HI> as enjoyn'd by the 36th <HI>Canon</HI> of King <HI>Iames,</HI> and by his <HI>Regal</HI> Authority <HI>out</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> as illegal, notwithstanding what had been <HI>ena|cted</HI> in the 13th of Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>He doth not. And he there further faith, <HI>By the Statute of</HI> 13. Eliz. <HI>the Delinquent is disabled and deprived</HI> ipso facto: <HI>but the Delinquent a|gainst the Canon of King</HI> James <HI>is to be proceeded withall by the Censures of the Church. And I heard</HI> Wray <HI>Chief Iustice in the King's Bench,</HI> Pasch. 23. El. <HI>report, That where one</HI> Smith <HI>subscribed to the said</HI> 39 <HI>Articles of Religion with this addition,</HI> so far forth as the same were agreeable to the Word o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> God, <HI>that it was resolv'd by him and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">l the Iudges of</HI> England, <HI>that this Subscription was not according to the Statute of</HI> 13. Eliz. <HI>because this Statute required an absolute Subscription,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Besides this Subscription when any Clerk is admitted and instituted to any Benefice, he is sworn to Ca|nonical Obedience to his Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">cesan.</HI></P>
<P>But as to his saying that <HI>the Delinquent against this Canon is to be procee|ded withall by the Censures of the Church;</HI> I shall observe that the <HI>beginning</HI> of the <HI>Canon</HI> doth <HI>incapacitate</HI> any to be <HI>receiv'd into the Ministry</HI> who doth not <HI>subscribe</HI> the <HI>three Articles</HI> in it, and that the <HI>Canon</HI> doth afterward put some temporary <HI>Disabilities</HI> on <HI>Bishops</HI> who shall <HI>Ordain, Admit</HI> or <HI>License</HI> any one, <HI>except he first have subscribed in manner and form there appointed:</HI> and it is the <HI>Universities</HI> if <HI>offending</HI> that the Canon leaves <HI>to the Danger of the Law and His Majesty's Censure.</HI></P>
<P>Here then you see King <HI>Iames</HI> the First did <HI>out</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> add a <HI>new</HI> Subscription to what was required by the <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament,</HI> and did like|wise <HI>out</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> make <HI>incapacity</HI> to be the <HI>Punishment</HI> of <HI>refusing</HI> such new Subscription.</P>
<P>And I need not tell you that that <HI>Power</HI> so exercised by that <HI>Prince</HI> out of <HI>Parliament</HI> hath been <HI>approved</HI> not only by all the <HI>Bishops</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> as putting the <HI>Form</HI> of <HI>Subscription</HI> required by that <HI>Canon</HI> in execution ever since and to this day in <HI>lieu</HI> of the <HI>form</HI> required by the 13th of <HI>Eliz.</HI> but (as I may say) <HI>virtually</HI> and <HI>tacitly</HI> by all our <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Parliaments</HI> ever since, who have acquiesced in the same. But what if I should tell you that the <HI>Authority</HI> of the <HI>King</HI> in thus making that <HI>Canon</HI> about <HI>Subscription,</HI> hath been since expresly <HI>approved</HI> in <HI>Par|liament?</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may therefore please to consult the <HI>Act</HI> for <HI>Uniformity</HI> 16^o <HI>Car.</HI> 2. and in the latter end of it you will see that in a <HI>Proviso</HI> referring to the 39 <HI>Articles</HI> as <HI>agreed on by the Archbishops,</HI> &amp;c. A. 1562. and <HI>particularly</HI> to the 36th therein about <HI>the Book of Consecration of Archbishops,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>set forth in the time of</HI> Edward <HI>the</HI> 6th, as <HI>containing all things necessary to such Con|secration and Ordering,</HI> &amp;c. It is <HI>Enacted,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>that all Subscriptions here|after to be had or made to the said Articles by any Deacon, Priest, &amp;c. or other person whatsoever, who by this Act or any OTHER LAW now in force is required to subscribe unto the said Articles shall be construed and taken to extend and shall be applyed (for and touching the said 36th Article) to the Book containing the form and manner of making, or|daining, and consecrating of Bishops, Priests,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>in this Act mentioned in such sort and manner as the same did heretofore extend to the Book set forth in the time of King Edward the 6th mention'd in the said 36th Ar|ticle, any thing in the said Article, or in any Statute, Act, or Canon heretofore had or made to the Contrary hereof in any wise notwith|standing.</HI></P>
<P>It is clear that the <HI>Parliament</HI> had then their <HI>Eye</HI> on the <HI>Act</HI> of 13. <HI>Eliz.</HI> and on that <HI>Canon</HI> of King <HI>Iames,</HI> and which you may take as <HI>referr'd</HI> to by the words, <HI>or any other Law now in force</HI> (for so they then knew it to be, and as it still is, tho with the <HI>interpretation</HI> extended by the <HI>Act</HI> to it) and afterward by the word <HI>Canon.</HI></P>
<P>But one may guess that by the Authority of some of the <HI>Lords</HI> the <HI>Bi|shops</HI> there was before the making of this <HI>Canon</HI> of King <HI>Iames,</HI> and after the <HI>Act</HI> of 13. <HI>Eliz.</HI> in her Reign, some <HI>Subscription</HI> under <HI>disabling</HI> Penal|ties <HI>required</HI> of <HI>Ministers</HI> beyond what that <HI>Statute</HI> required, by what the <HI>Author</HI> of <HI>Certain Considerations tending to promote Peace</HI> mentions, in p. 4. viz. <HI>That in the 30th year of the Reign of Queen</HI> Elizabeth, <HI>the House of Commons presented to the Lords Spiritual and Temporal a Petition con|taining divers particulars, for the redress whereof they desire, that no Oath or Subscription might be tender'd to any at their entrance into the Ministry, but such as is expresly prescribed by the Statutes of the Realm, except the Oath against Corrupt entring, that they may not be troubled for the omis|sion of some Rites, or Portions prescribed in the Book of Common Prayer: that such as had been suspended for no other Offence, but only for not subscri|bing might be restored.</HI></P>

<P>It seems those Bishops then did as your Expression was, <HI>Dispensare in lege,</HI> and were (as I may say) <HI>Non-conformists</HI> to it, by going <HI>beyond</HI> it. For they were obliged <HI>sapere ad Regulam;</HI> and all <HI>Conformity</HI> is <HI>respectu regulae,</HI> and he who doth <HI>over-shoot,</HI> or who over-does what is enjoyn'd, is a <HI>Non-conformist.</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>You here put me in mind how some of our <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Clergy</HI> have been thus <HI>Non-conformists</HI> in over-shooting their mark, at the same time that they have with undistinguishing severity executed the rigour of the Laws against all who did <HI>shoot</HI> short.

<P>But I a little wonder that a <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Commons</HI> should <HI>Petition</HI> for the <HI>Dispensing</HI> with some <HI>legal</HI> Rites, and required both by <HI>Injunctions</HI> and <HI>Canons,</HI> and by <HI>Acts</HI> of Parliament.</P>

<P>I do not wonder at it at all. For <HI>Conjunctures</HI> having happen'd when some <HI>Non-conformists</HI> having been <HI>tender</HI> of the Peace of the Government,
<PB N="89" REF="48" MS="y">
you need not wonder at any tenderness in it for them. For as in the Con|juncture of the <HI>Resteration</HI> of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, very many of the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> and of other Sects then shewing their <HI>Loyalty</HI> (the <HI>Author</HI> I lately cited taking notice thus of the <HI>Declaration,</HI> A. 1660. viz. <HI>in which his Majesty saith Our present Consideration and work is to gratifie the private Co|sciences of those who are grieved with some Ceremonies, by indulging to and dis|pensing with the omitting of those Ceremonies.

<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am highly pleas'd with your further bringing any thing to me like <HI>Iudgment</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> that may strengthen the Regal Power of <HI>interpre|ting,</HI> or of <HI>dispensing</HI> with <HI>disability.</HI> We have discours'd of the Subject a pretty while together at this Meeting, and I must acknowledge you have entertain'd me with an account of many <HI>Statutes</HI> that have propp'd up the <HI>Regal</HI> Power of <HI>dispensing</HI> with <HI>disability:</HI> and that too (tho you observ'd it not to me) not only in their <HI>Preambles,</HI> but in their <HI>enacting</HI> parts, the which I account more momentous. Nor can I forbear observing it to you, that in the late Printed <HI>Books</HI> of some who <HI>asserted</HI> this <HI>dispensative</HI> Power, nothing like <HI>Iudgment</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> hath been <HI>cited</HI> in the case for it, but that out of <HI>Rot. Parl.</HI> 1. <HI>H.</HI> 5. 11. 22. out of <HI>Rolle Tit. Prerogative le Roy, fol.</HI> 180. viz. <HI>The Commons prayed that the Statutes for voiding of Aliens out of the Kingdom might be executed, to which the Ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">g agreed saving his Prerogative, that he might dispense with such as he pleas'd. And upon this the Commons answer'd, that their intention was no other, nor ever should be, by the help of God.</HI></P>
<P>But this was only the <HI>judgment</HI> of a <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Commons;</HI> and that is <HI>short</HI> of the <HI>Authority</HI> of a <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Lords</HI> concurring with them, tho but in a <HI>Petitionary</HI> manner, that the Regal <HI>Dispensative</HI> Power might be exerted: and which <HI>latter</HI> is far short of the Authority of an <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament.</HI> And among the many <HI>Parliamentary</HI> Recognitions of the <HI>Dispensative</HI> Power you have mention<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">d to me, that which you told me at our <HI>first</HI> meeting of the <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Uniformity</HI> 16^o <HI>Car.</HI> 2. leaving <HI>Aliens</HI> or <HI>Foreigners</HI> of the Reform'd Churches that were then <HI>allow'd</HI> or tolerated by the King's Maje|sty, or that should be <HI>allow'd</HI> by him, his Heirs and Successors, to be secu|red under the Wing of Prerogative from all the <HI>Penalties</HI> in that <HI>Act,</HI> was a greater President of a Parliament's deference to the <HI>Dispensative</HI> Power.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="49">But here it falls in my way to ask you if the <HI>Parliament</HI> in that Act, <HI>in|terpreting</HI> and <HI>expounding</HI> the <HI>Sulscription</HI> to the 36th <HI>Article</HI> (as you be|fore mention'd) did not shew some want of tenderness to the <HI>Regal</HI> Power of <HI>interpreting?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in the least. The King thought fit in his <HI>Legislative</HI> Capacity, and with the Concurrence of the three Estates to issue forth such interpre|tation, to the end it might be perpetuated. But you will find that they were so tender of that branch of Prerogative, namely of the Regal Power of interpreting <HI>out</HI> of <HI>Parliament,</HI> that having referr'd to the King's <HI>Declara|tion</HI> of the 25th of <HI>October,</HI> 1660. (<HI>i. e.</HI> that concerning <HI>Ecclesiastical Af|fairs</HI> we spoke of before) and mention'd that according to that <HI>he had gran|ted his Commission to several Bishops and other Divines to review the Book of Common Prayer, and to prepare such Alterations and Addi|tions as they thought fit to offer, and that afterwards the Convocations of both the Provinces of</HI> Canterbury <HI>and York, being by His Majesty called,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>His Majesty hath been pleas'd to Authorize the Presidents of the said Convocation, and other the Bishops and Clergy of the same to review the Book of Common Prayer, and the Book of the form and man|ner of the making and consecrating of Bishops, Priests,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and that they should make such Additions and Alterations in the said Books as to them should seem meet, and should present the same to His Majesty for his further Allowance or Confirmation,</HI> and then setting forth that the same was accordingly done, and that some <HI>alterations</HI> were inserted into those Books by the <HI>Convocations,</HI> and by them <HI>Presented</HI> to His Maje|sty, and <HI>all which His Majesty having consider'd hath fully approved,</HI> it then follows, <HI>that His Majesty hath recommended to this present Parlia|ment that the Books of Common Prayer,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>with the Alterations and Additions which have been so made and presented to His Majesty by the said Convocations, be the Book which shall be appointed to be used,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>in all Parish Churches and Chapels,</HI> &amp;c. And it is upon the <HI>foundation</HI> of what His <HI>Majesty</HI> did as before-mention'd, that the following <HI>enacting</HI> Clauses with their Sanctions and Penalties are built.</P>
<P>And you may if you will take notice of a <HI>Proviso</HI> toward the end of the <HI>Act,</HI> being very tender of not hurting what King <HI>Iames</HI> by his Prerogative did in <HI>Uniting</HI> the <HI>Prebendship</HI> to the <HI>Professor</HI> of <HI>Law</HI> in <HI>Oxon</HI> for the time being, and whereby that <HI>King</HI> dispens'd with the <HI>incapacity</HI> of <HI>Lay-men,</HI> as to the enjoyment of such <HI>Prebendship:</HI> but the <HI>Act</HI> and the <HI>Proviso</HI> takes care to perpetuate the King's Professor's enjoying the same, and leaves the <HI>Prerogative</HI> at liberty to <HI>dispense</HI> with such <HI>disability</HI> in the Case.</P>
<P>In short, you see how <HI>tender</HI> that <HI>Parliament</HI> was of <HI>Prerogative,</HI> and tho they thought it not fit to give such loud <HI>Applauses</HI> to his late Majesty's <HI>Declaration</HI> of <HI>October</HI> the 25th, <HI>A.</HI> 1660. before-mention'd, wherein so much of the <HI>Dispensative</HI> Power was exerted, yet you find they <HI>refer</HI> to it with respect.</P>

<P>Why, then I can tell you if you will at any time turn to your <HI>Col|lection</HI> of <HI>Proclamations</HI> in the time of King <HI>Iames</HI> the <HI>First,</HI> you will find that in his <HI>Proclamation</HI> of <HI>March</HI> the 5th, the <HI>first</HI> year of his Reign, he in|timates that <HI>with the Consent of the Bishops present in the</HI> Hampton-Court <HI>Conference he thought meet that some small things might rather be explain'd then changed in the Book of Common Prayer, and for that end gave forth his Commission under the Great Seal of</HI> England, <HI>ac|cording to the Form which the Laws of this Realm in like Case pre|scribed to be used to make the said Explanation, and to cause the whole Book of Common Prayer with the same Explanation to be newly Prin|ted, which being done and establish'd, anew after so serious a Delibera|tion,</HI>
<PB N="92" REF="50">
&amp;c. <HI>we have thought it necessary to make known by Proclamation our authorizing of the same, and to require and enjoyn all men, as well Ecclesiastical as Temporal to Conform themselves to it, as the only publick Form of serving God, establish'd and allow'd to be in this Realm. And the rather for that all the Learned Men who were there present, as well of the Bishops as others, promised their Conformity in the practice of it, only making sute to us that some few might be born with for a time. Wherefore we require all Archbishops, Bishops, and all other publick Ministers, as well Ecclesiastical as Civil, to do their Duties in causing the same to be obey'd, and in punishing the Offenders according to the Laws of the Realm heretofore establish'd for the Authorizing the said Book of Common Prayer.</HI></P>
<P>You see there that all the <HI>Bishops</HI> and the great <HI>Parade</HI> of the <HI>literati</HI> present at that famous <HI>Conference,</HI> did <HI>implore</HI> the King for the exercise of his <HI>Dispensative</HI> Power for a while to some <HI>few.</HI></P>
<P>But what is more considerable is, that the <HI>King</HI> here doth make a gene|ral <HI>relaxation</HI> of the <HI>Bond</HI> of Queen <HI>Elizabeth's Act</HI> of <HI>Uniformity</HI> in some things; and instead of inserting an express <HI>Clause</HI> of <HI>discharging</HI> from the <HI>Penalties</HI> of that <HI>Act,</HI> all that use the <HI>Common Prayer Book</HI> with the King's <HI>Alterations</HI> or <HI>Explanations,</HI> as Queen <HI>Elizabeth's Admonition</HI> did in rela|tion to those who <HI>took</HI> the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Supremacy</HI> in the <HI>sense</HI> of her <HI>Interpre|tation,</HI> (a thing indeed not necessary for either of them to have done when they had <HI>loosen'd</HI> the <HI>bond</HI> of the <HI>Observance</HI> of the <HI>Law</HI>) he enjoyns the <HI>uniform</HI> usage of the <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Common Prayer,</HI> as by him interpreted or <HI>ex|plain'd</HI> (the title of the Proclamation being A <HI>Proclamation for the autho|rizing an Uniformity of the Book of Common Prayer to be used throughout the Realm</HI>) under the <HI>disabling</HI> Punishments of Queen <HI>Elizabeth's Act</HI> of <HI>Uni|formity;</HI> the <HI>Bishops</HI> all this while being ministerial to the King in his Power of thus interpreting, and <HI>explaining</HI> an Act of <HI>Parliament,</HI> and the <HI>loosening</HI> of its <HI>Obligation</HI> both as to themselves and others.</P>
<P>I am to tell you, that in that <HI>Proclamation</HI> of <HI>March</HI> the <HI>fifth,</HI> the <HI>King</HI> refers to a <HI>Proclamation</HI> he had before Publish'd on the 24th of <HI>October</HI> then last past, wherein he gave the <HI>Puritan</HI> Divines an intimation of the <HI>Conference</HI> he intended to have: and in which he reflects on <HI>the heat of their Spirits as tending rather to Combustion then Reformation, which</HI> (saith he) <HI>if there be Cause to make, is more in our hearts then theirs,</HI> &amp;c. and afterwards saith, <HI>we are not ignorant that time may have brought in some. Corruptions, which may deserve a review and amendment, which if by the Assembly intended by us, we shall find to be so indeed, we will therein proc&eacute;ed according to the Laws and Customs of this Realm by Ad|vice of our Councel, or in our High Court of Parliament, or by Con|vocation of our Clergy, as we shall find reason to lead us: not doubting but that in such an orderly proceeding, we shall have the Prelates &amp; others of our Clergy no less willing and far more able to afford us their Duty and Service, then any other whose zeal doth go so fast before their dis|cretion.</HI></P>
<P>And the <HI>Proclamation</HI> in <HI>March</HI> following shew'd you how the King's reason lead him in his <HI>Proceeding</HI> in the Affair <HI>according to the Laws and Customs of this Realm,</HI> and how loyally his <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Clergy</HI> ac|quiesced therein.</P>

<P>I remember I have read both these <HI>Proclamations:</HI> and I doubt not but that <HI>Hampton-Court Conference</HI> made a great <HI>ferment</HI> in the Body of the Peo|ple, tho none in the <HI>Orthodox</HI> Clergy. But I should be glad to know whe|ther it made any <HI>fermentation</HI> in the Body of the People <HI>Representative,</HI>
<PB N="93" REF="50">
and what was the <HI>Result</HI> of it? Did the <HI>Parliament</HI> acquiesce in what the King had done as aforesaid? For if so; they had done as Queen <HI>Elizabeth's</HI> Parliament in publickly <HI>approving</HI> what she by her own Ecclesiastical <HI>Supre|macy</HI> did in discharging the <HI>disabling</HI> Penalties in her first <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament,</HI> and in <HI>relaxing</HI> by her <HI>interpretation,</HI> the <HI>vinculum</HI> for its observance in that sense that many had before put on it.</P>

<P>King <HI>Iames</HI> his <HI>Parliament</HI> did in effect, the very self-same thing. And I shall give you the account of it out of his <HI>Proclamation</HI> of the <HI>16th</HI> of <HI>Iuly,</HI> A. 1604. in the Second <HI>year</HI> of his Reign: for there having spoke of that <HI>Conference</HI> and of his having <HI>Publish'd</HI> by <HI>Proclamation</HI> what was the <HI>issue</HI> of it, and <HI>his hoping that when the same should be made known all reaso|nable Men would have rested satisfy'd with that which had been done, and not have moved further trouble of Speech of Matters whereof so solemn and advised deliberation had been made,</HI> His Majesty's following words are, <HI>Notwithstanding at the late Assembly of our Parliament, there wanted not many who renew'd with no little earnestness the Questions before determin'd, and many more as well about the Book of Common Prayer, as other Matters of Church Government, and importuned us for our assent to many Alterations therein: but yet with such Success, as when they heard both our own Speeches made to them at sundry times, shew|ing the Reasons of our former Proceedings in those Matters, and like|wise had had Conference with some Bishops, and other Lords of the Up|per House about the same, they desisted from further Prosecution thereof, finding that of all things that might any way tend to the furtherance of Religion and of Establishment of a Ministry fit for the same, we had be|fore with the Advice of our Councel, had such Consideration as the pre|sent state of things would bear, and taken order how the same should be prosecuted by such means as might be used without any publick distur|bance or innovation.</HI></P>
<P>And in how vigorous a State the <HI>Dispensative</HI> Power as to the <HI>Non|conformists</HI> afterward continued in the Reign of that Prince appears by what I have before cited of an Application made to him by the House of Com|mons for the exercise of the same to the Non-conformists, in the 10th <HI>year</HI> of his Reign.</P>
<P>Moreover how by <HI>Tacit</HI> Dispensation he <HI>dispens'd</HI> with the <HI>Disabilities</HI> that Roman Catholick <HI>Physicians</HI> and <HI>Lawyers</HI> had incurr'd by his <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Parliament,</HI> I have told you. But what if I should now tell you how after|wards he did take care as it were <HI>un&acirc; litur&acirc;,</HI> to <HI>delete</HI> the <HI>Execution</HI> of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ll</HI> the <HI>Penal</HI> Laws, <HI>disabling</HI> ones, and others, against the <HI>Roman Catholicks;</HI> and that as to what he did therein, the most zealous Protestants among his <HI>Bishops,</HI> and the Lords <HI>Temporal</HI> and others of his <HI>Privy Council,</HI> did concur with him in so doing?</P>

<P>As in the <HI>Happy future State of</HI> England it was with an intent to detect the Degeneracy and Vanity of the <HI>Politick</HI> and <HI>Protestant-would-be's</HI> of the Age who pretended to Advance Religion by Excluding the next Heir, in <HI>p.</HI> 219. shewn that <HI>one of the general and publick Articles sent by King</HI> James <HI>the First to his Embassador in</HI> Spain, <Q><TEXT LANG="eng">

<P><HI>in Order to the Match with the Infanta was, that the Children of this Marriage shall no way be compell'd or constrain'd in point of Conscience or Religion, wherefore there is no doubt that their title shall be prejudiced in case it should please God that they turn'd Catholicks, and that it was afterward sent as an additional Article offer'd from</HI> England, <HI>that the King of</HI> Great Britain <HI>and Prince of</HI> Wales <HI>should bind themselves by Oath for the Observance of the Articles, and that the Privy</HI>
<PB N="94" REF="51">
<HI>Council should sign the same under their Hands, and that accordingly the Articles were sign'd by Archbishop</HI> Abbot, John <HI>Bishop of</HI> Lincoln, <HI>Keeper of the Great Seal,</HI> Lionel <HI>Earl of</HI> Middlesex, <HI>Lord high Treasurer of</HI> Eng|land, Henry <HI>Viscount</HI> Mandevile, <HI>Lord President of the Council,</HI> Edward <HI>Earl of</HI> Worcester, <HI>Lord Privy Seal,</HI> Lewis <HI>Duke of</HI> Richmond <HI>and</HI> Lennox <HI>Lord high Steward of the Houshold,</HI> James <HI>Marquess of</HI> Hamilton, James <HI>Earl of</HI> Carlisle, Lancelot <HI>Bishop of</HI> Winchester, Oliver <HI>Viscount</HI> Grandison, Arthur <HI>Baron</HI> Chichester <HI>of</HI> Belfast, <HI>Lord Treasurer of</HI> Ireland, <HI>Sir</HI> Thomas Edmonds <HI>Knight, Treasurer of the Houshold, Sir</HI> John Suckling, <HI>Comptrol|ler of the Houshold, Sir</HI> George Calvert, <HI>and Sir</HI> Edward Conway, <HI>Prin|cipal Secretaries of State, Sir</HI> Richard Weston, <HI>Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir</HI> Julius Caesar, <HI>Mr. of the Rolls;</HI> and for the truth of which Facts, <HI>refe|rence</HI> is there made to Mr. <HI>Prynne's Introduction to the Archbishop of</HI> Can|terbury's <HI>Trial,</HI> p. 43: so you may there read it in <HI>p.</HI> 44. that some <HI>private</HI> Articles were agreed on, and probably were Sworn to by the same Persons that the other general ones were: and of which <HI>private</HI> ones, the <HI>first</HI> was in short, That <HI>none of the Penal Laws against Roman Catholicks should at any time hereafter be put in Execution.</HI></P>
<P>But you may thus see it at large: <HI>viz. That particular Laws made against Roman Catholicks, under which other Subjects of our Realms are not compre|hended, and to whose Observation all generally are not obliged, as likewise general Laws, under which all are equally Comprised; if so be they are such as are repugnant to the Romish Religion, shall not at any time hereafter by any means or chance whatsoever directly or indirectly, be commanded to be put in Execution against the said Roman-Catholicks. And we will cause that our Councel shall take the same Oath, as far as it pertains to them, and belongs to the Execution which by the hands of them and their Ministers is to be exercised.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>2d</HI> was, <HI>That no other Laws shall hereafter be made anew against the said Roman Catholicks; but that there shall be a perpetual Toleration of the Roman Catholick Religion within Private Houses throughout all our Realms and Dominions, which we will have to be understood, as well of our Kingdom of</HI> Scotland <HI>and</HI> Ireland, <HI>as in</HI> England, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And the <HI>4th</HI> was, <HI>That we will interpose our Authority, and will do as much as in us shall lie, that the Parliament shall approve, confirm and ratifie all and singular Articles in favour of the Roman-Catholicks, capitulated be|tween the most renowned Kings, by reason of this Marriage; and that the said Parliament shall revoke and abrogate the particular Laws made against the said Roman-Catholicks,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And the Conclusion there is, viz. <HI>That we will interpose our Authority, and will do as much as in us shall lie, that the Parliament shall approve, confirm and ratifie all and singular Articles in favour of the Roman-Catho|licks, capitulated between the most renowned Kings, by reason of this Mar|riage; and that the said Parliament shall revoke and abrogate the particular Laws made against the said Roman-Catholicks, to whose observance also: the rest of our Subjects and Vassals are not obliged; as likewise the general Laws under which all are equally comprehended, to wit, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s to the Roman-Catholicks, if they be such as is aforesaid, which are repugnant to the Roman-Catholick Religion: and that hereafter we will not consent, that the said Parliament should ever at any time Enact or Write any other new Laws against Roman-Catholicks.

<P>Thus far Mr. <HI>Prynne;</HI> who verifies the Facts above-mention'd, not only from my Lord <HI>Cottington</HI>'s Papers, but from the <HI>Mercure Francois,</HI> Tom. 9. <HI>A.</HI> 1624. <HI>p.</HI> 25, 26, 27. and on which <HI>Author</HI> he in <HI>p.</HI> 47. bestows the <HI>Cha|racter</HI> of <HI>one of the truest Historians of this latter Age:</HI> and whom Mr. <HI>Prynne</HI> had before in <HI>p.</HI> 40. cited for the truth of the general <HI>Articles</HI> referring to <HI>Tom</HI> 9. p. 11. and 28. And I shall here observe to you, that what Mr. <HI>Prynne</HI> hath set down as aforesaid, to be the <HI>Form</HI> of the <HI>Oath</HI> took by the <HI>Lords</HI> of the <HI>Councel</HI> to the <HI>former</HI> Articles, doth appear to be referr'd by him to <HI>both</HI> sorts of <HI>Articles,</HI> viz. both the <HI>general</HI> and the <HI>private</HI> ones. For tho toward the end of the <HI>general</HI> Articles it appear'd only that <HI>the King and Prince were to be Sworn that all the Privy Councellors should sign those Ar|ticles under their hands,</HI> and that the King <HI>Subscribed</HI> those <HI>Articles,</HI> and was <HI>sworn</HI> to them in the <HI>presence</HI> of those <HI>Bishops</HI> and other <HI>Privy Coun|cellors</HI> before named; yet the <HI>first</HI> of the <HI>private</HI> Articles agreeing that <HI>the Councel should take the Oath as far as pertain'd to them, and belong'd to the Execution which by the hands of them and their Ministers is to be exercised,</HI> that the <HI>Penal</HI> Laws should not be <HI>executed</HI> against <HI>Roman-Catholicks,</HI> I ac|count it appears according to Mr. <HI>Prynne</HI> that the Privy Councellors were Sworn to both Articles together: and that by the words of <HI>IURO ETIAM,</HI> &amp;c. the <HI>private</HI> Articles were referr'd to; and the which will ap|pear the more manifest, if you consider that the <HI>general</HI> Articles had not one word therein for the <HI>tolerating</HI> of more <HI>Papists</HI> then those of the <HI>In|fanta</HI>'s Family, and such who particularly belong'd to her. Nor was there any thing more as to the <HI>Privy Councellors</HI> agreed to in the <HI>general</HI> Articles, then their signing them. And both the <HI>general</HI> and <HI>private</HI> Articles bearing
<PB N="96" REF="52" MS="y">
the same Date, it may be the rather supposed that <HI>pursuant</HI> to the first <HI>private</HI> Article, containing the King's Covenant for the Privy Councel's being <HI>sworn</HI> to them, that the <HI>Bishops</HI> and the other <HI>Privy Councellors</HI> might then be <HI>sworn</HI> to them, as well as their having then particularly signed or <HI>subscribed</HI> the <HI>general</HI> Articles appears: for so Mr. <HI>Prynne</HI>'s words are, p. 44. <HI>The King and the Embassadors went to the Councel-Chamber, where all the Lords of the Councel seal'd and subscribed the general Articles of the Marriage,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I account you are not ignorant how much it hath been observ'd that Mr. <HI>Prynne,</HI> who was so voluminous a Writer, did too much take his <HI>Quotations</HI> on trust; and that therefore what he had as out of the <HI>Mercure Francois</HI> might not be rightly cited.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Admitting that Mr. <HI>Prynne</HI> being so infinite in his Quotations might often erre that way, I shall tell you, that I engaging a Learned Man of the <HI>University</HI> of <HI>Oxford</HI> to consult Mr. <HI>Prynne</HI>'s Quotations out of the <HI>Mercure</HI> (of which the <HI>Tomes</HI> are in the <HI>Bodleian</HI> Library) he return'd me word, that they exactly agreed with the <HI>Author</HI> in the places cited by Mr. <HI>Prynne.</HI></P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>But one would scarce think that Archbishop <HI>Abbot</HI> should swear to these private <HI>Articles;</HI> for there went about a <HI>Letter</HI> of his in that <HI>Conjun|cture,</HI> by the warm name of <HI>his Remonstrance to His Majesty</HI> against the <HI>Match,</HI> and the <HI>toleration</HI> of the Roman-Catholicks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant that there did: and Mr. <HI>Prynne</HI> in <HI>p.</HI> 39. and 40. sets down the <HI>Letter;</HI> and he calls it <HI>A Remonstrance:</HI> and the Archbishop is there brought in, saying thus, <HI>viz. This Toleration which you endeavour to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">t up by your Proclamation, cannot be done without an Act of Parliament,</HI> &amp;c. But <HI>Heylin</HI> in his <HI>History of the Presbyterians,</HI> represents this as a Sham-Letter, and put upon the Archbishop: and saith, that <HI>the Archbishop could not be so ill a Statesman (having been long a Privy Councellor) as not to know that he who sits at Helm, must steer his Course according to Wind and Weather, and that there was a great difference between such Personal Indulgences as the King had granted in the Case to his Popish Subjects, and any such Publick exercise of their Superstitions as the word</HI> Toleration <HI>doth import.</HI> And so he giveth Judgment, <HI>that</HI> Abbot <HI>was only the reputed Author of this Bastard Letter, and not the natural Parent of it.</HI></P>
<P>In the various Editions of this <HI>Letter,</HI> I have observ'd no <HI>date</HI> to it: and it is in that Book of Mr. <HI>Prynne</HI> before his mention of the <HI>general</HI> or <HI>pri|vate</HI> Articles, and before the <HI>Match</HI> was resolv'd on by the King. And if notwithstanding that <HI>Letter,</HI> the Archbishop was afterward Sworn to the <HI>Articles,</HI> his altering his judgment on grounds of Reason, was both com|mendable, and <HI>exemplary:</HI> and worthy of that mutual <HI>Confidence</HI> between the King and him and the other <HI>Bishops</HI> in the <HI>Councel,</HI> and his Privy Councel in general; and which was such, that in a lawful Matter the King could <HI>stipulate</HI> for their Obedience in the first <HI>private</HI> Article as was before mention'd.</P>

<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your having shew'd me out of the Copy of the Publick Instruments found by Mr. <HI>Prynne</HI> among my Lord <HI>Cottington</HI>'s Papers what concerns the <HI>Toleration,</HI> hath given me much satisfaction in the truth of that Fact. For otherwise what a late Book writ for <HI>The King's Right in dispensing with the Penal Laws</HI> directed me to in <HI>Rushworth</HI> of <HI>The Declaration touching the Pardons, Suspensions, and Dispensations of the Roman-Catholicks, sign'd by the Lord</HI> Conway <HI>and others,</HI> Aug. the <HI>7th.</HI> A. 1623. would have left the Matter to me full of doubt and mystery.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="52" MS="y">But I see by those <HI>Copies</HI> of <HI>Articles</HI> found among the Papers of my Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> the <HI>Toleration</HI> of <HI>Papists</HI> had been <HI>rever&acirc;</HI> about a Fort|night before the <HI>date</HI> of that Paper <HI>sworn</HI> to by all the Privy Councellors of King <HI>Iames.</HI> And tho King <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>First</HI> did fall as a <HI>Martyr</HI> for the Protestant Religion, and was a <HI>Confessor</HI> of it in <HI>Spain,</HI> as Archbishop <HI>Laud</HI> sets forth in his <HI>Star-Chamber</HI> Speech, and as likewise the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Bristol</HI> shews in his Learned and Loyal <HI>Apology,</HI> Printed, <HI>A.</HI> 1657.

<P>But I shall here <HI>en passant</HI> observe to you out of the <HI>general</HI> Articles, namely that in the 16th <HI>Article</HI> (notwithstanding my Lord <HI>Coke</HI>'s Opi|nion before-mention'd, that a <HI>new</HI> Oath cannot be introduced nor an <HI>old</HI> one <HI>alter'd</HI> but by <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI>) there is a <HI>new</HI> Oath of fealty agreed to by the King to be tender'd both to <HI>Foreigners</HI> and <HI>Subjects</HI> of <HI>England</HI> who were to serve the <HI>Infanta,</HI> and care taken <HI>that no Clause or word therein shall contradict the Roman Religion, or Consciences of the Roman-Catholicks:</HI> and that by the 24th <HI>Article</HI> for <HI>the Security that every thing that was agreed to, should be fulfill'd, the King and Prince were to be bound by Oath, that all the Privy Councellors should sign the Agreement,</HI> And I need not tell you that their being <HI>sworn</HI> to the <HI>private</HI> Articles was a new Oath.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Prynne</HI> there in <HI>p.</HI> 30. saith, that <HI>for the hastening the Pope's Dis|pensation for the Match, King</HI> James (<HI>as the French Mercure,</HI> Tom. 9. <HI>re|cords it, and as he had CREDIBLY been inform'd of from others) assembling his Privy Councel together,</HI> Febr. 25. 1622. <HI>made a long Oration to them (which he recites at large) the sum whereof was this, That the Roman-Catholicks in</HI> England <HI>had sustain'd great and intolerable surcharges imposed on their Goods, Bodies, Consciences during Queen</HI> Elizabeth's <HI>Reign, of which</HI>
<PB N="98" REF="53">
<HI>they hoped to be relieved in his,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>That now he had maturely consider'd the Penury and Calamities of the Roman-Catholicks who were in the number of his faithful Subjects, and was resolv'd to relieve them, and therefore did from thenceforth take all his Roman-Catholick Subjects into his Protection, permit|ting them the Liberty and entire Exercise of their Religion,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>without any Inquisition, Process, or Molestation from that day forward; and likewise will and ordain, that they shall be restored to all their Estates, Lands, Fees and Seignories, and re-establish'd in them: Commanding all his Magistrates, Iustices, and other Officers whatsoever in this behalf to hold their hands, and for what Cause soever it be, not to attempt hereafter to grieve or molest the said Catholicks, neither in publick nor private in the liberty of the exercise of their Religion, upon pain of being reputed Guilty of High Treason, and Di|sturbers of the Kingdoms peace and repose: this being his will and defini|tive Sentence.</HI></P>

<P>But still I cannot forbear wondring about what Considerations made our <HI>Divines,</HI> and our Great <HI>Champions</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England-Protestancy</HI> in the <HI>State</HI> as well as <HI>Church,</HI> afterward thus inclinable to act their Parts about <HI>Toleration,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Prynne</HI> hath mention'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>They had cause enough to apprehend that the <HI>Hierarchy</HI> of <HI>England</HI> could not be supported without the <HI>Monarchy,</HI> and that by reason of the various growth of the Potency of <HI>foreign</HI> Princes and States, and of <HI>inte|stine</HI> Factions, the <HI>Monarchy</HI> could not be then sufficiently secure without a <HI>foreign</HI> Alliance by inter-marriage; and that where such Alliance was to be with the Famili<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s of <HI>Roman-Catholick</HI> Princes, there could be no expectation of the Pope's <HI>relaxing</HI> his Laws by <HI>dispensing,</HI> without our Princes doing something of that kind as to theirs.</P>
<P>I might here observe to you, that we are told in <HI>The Regal Apology</HI> (that the <HI>Oxford&punc;Antiquities</HI> mention'd to have been writ by Dr. <HI>Bate</HI>) that <HI>A particular Toleration had a former President even in Queen</HI> Elizabeth <HI>in those Articles of Marriage which were consented to with the Duke of</HI> Anjou: <HI>and if it were true that an Universal Toleration was agreed on by King</HI> James, <HI>it was</HI> intuitu majoris boni. <HI>The Palatinate was to be restored again, and the Protestants of</HI> Germany <HI>to be re-enstated in their Possessions on that Condition.</HI></P>
<P>But to <HI>punish</HI> being a kind of <HI>Punishment,</HI> and it being <HI>irreligious</HI> to punish Men for <HI>Religion,</HI> and the highest <HI>tide</HI> of Anger being naturally succeeded by the lowest <HI>ebbe</HI> of it, and the thoughts of rigorous Severity in <HI>Prin|ces</HI> toward their <HI>Subjects</HI> being like such in the <HI>Head</HI> toward the <HI>Members</HI> of the same Body, and King <HI>Iames</HI> having found that the general abhor|rence of the <HI>Gun-Powder-Treason</HI> had blown up the credit of those <HI>fiery</HI> Doctrines that produced it, and he being then within <HI>Prospect</HI> of his end and being unwilling that the <HI>Sun</HI> of his Life <HI>should go down in his wrath,</HI> and finding, as appears by his long <HI>Proclamation</HI> of four <HI>sheets</HI> of Paper, declaring his. Pleasure concerning the <HI>Dissolving</HI> of the <HI>Parliament,</HI> A. 16<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">1. that they were not the <HI>Papists</HI> who made his later breath so uneasie to him, and he being of opinion that the <HI>reason</HI> of the severe Laws was much <HI>aba|ted,</HI> it may abate of our wonder that in that Conjuncture he put a Period to their Execution.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Prynne</HI> for this purpose in <HI>p.</HI> 14. of that Book Prints a <HI>Letter</HI> of the Lord Keeper <HI>Williams</HI> to the <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">dges</HI> in the <HI>year</HI> following, to acquaint them that <HI>His Majesty having resolv'd (out of deep Reasons of State, and in expe|ctation of like Correspondence from foreign Princes to the Professors of our Religion) to grant some Grace and Conveniency to the imprison'd Papists of this Kingdom; had Commanded him to pass some Writs under the Broad Seal</HI>
<PB N="99" REF="53">
<HI>for that purpose, and that he had accordingly done so;</HI> and tells them, that <HI>'tis His Majesty's Pleasure that they shall make no niceness or difficulty to ex|tend that his Princely favour to all Papists imprison'd for any Church Recu|sancy whatsoever, or refusing the Oath of Supremacy, or hearing of Mass, or any other point of Recusancy which doth touch or concern Religion only, and not matters of State, which shall appear to you to be totally Civil and Political.</HI></P>

<P>In short, the <HI>Commons</HI> in their <HI>Petition</HI> take notice of the <HI>Growth</HI> of the <HI>Number</HI> of <HI>Popish Recusants in this Kingdom, and of their insolency in all the Parts thereof, and that many of them, contrary to the Laws, were g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">t into Offices and Places of Government and Authority under the King:</HI> And the <HI>Prayer</HI> of the Petition is, <HI>That the Lords and Gentlemen there under|named, may be removed from all His Majesty's Commissions of great Charge and Trust, Commissions of Lieutenancy, Oyer and Terminer, and of the Peace, and from all other Offices and Places of Trust.</HI> And they in their first <HI>Sche|d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">le</HI> there name 11 <HI>Lords</HI> and 18 <HI>Knights.</HI></P>

<P>Now have you set me a <HI>longing</HI> to know what the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Lords</HI> did in the Case of that <HI>Petition</HI> about <HI>removing</HI> those <HI>disabled</HI> Persons from <HI>serving</HI> the <HI>King</HI> in those great <HI>Stations.</HI> And since the Judgment of Par|liament was always had in such great veneration, I think if the result of the <HI>desire</HI> of the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Commons</HI> was that the Lords had <HI>joyn'd</HI> with them in the <HI>Petition,</HI> and had urged that the King could not <HI>dispense</HI> with that <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> and Pardon <HI>Disability,</HI> it may make a notable <HI>Pre|sident</HI> in the <HI>Case</HI> we have been discussing.</P>

<P>You will find that the <HI>Commons</HI> urged nothing to the prejudice of <HI>Prerogative</HI> in the <HI>Prayer</HI> of their <HI>Petition.</HI> Their <HI>style</HI> there was, <HI>We humbly beseech your Majesty graciously to vouchsafe that the said Lords and Gentlemen here under-named for this important Reason, and for the greater Safety of your Majesty and of your Realm, may be re|moved from all your Majesty's Commissions of great Charge and Trust, Commissions of Lieutenancy,</HI> &amp;c. And the <HI>important</HI> reason did refer to the <HI>great Countenance hereby given to Popery, the great grief and offence to all his best affected and true loving Subjects by putting the Power of Arms into such mens hands as by former Acts of His Majesty's Councel are adjudged Persons justly to be suspected,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall here afford your <HI>Curiosity</HI> a recompence by observing it to you with allusion to some of the words of the Royal <HI>Martyr</HI> in his <HI>Answer</HI> to the 19 <HI>Propositions, That the ancient, equal, happy, well poysed, and never enough commended Constitution of the Government of this Kingdom having made this Nation so famous and happy to a great degree of Envy,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and the Lords being trusted with a Iudicatory Power are an excellent Screen and Bank be|tween the Prince and the People, to assist each against any Encroachment of the other,</HI> &amp;c. that the Wisdom of that House in acting as it hath done, in many <HI>Conjunctures</HI> hath put an end to many ferments accidentally occa|sion'd by others mistakes about <HI>Prerogative,</HI> and whereby that <HI>august</HI> Assembly did sometimes <HI>Cunctando restituere rem,</HI> and by its forbearing out of <HI>tender<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ess</HI> for <HI>Prerogative</HI> to give judgment about it, hath often to the Satisfaction both of the <HI>Prince</HI> and <HI>People,</HI> left the <HI>Regal</HI> Rights in their ancient quiet Estate.</P>
<P>I shall for this purpose observe to you, that I once reading to the late <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Anglesy</HI> when he was Lord <HI>Privy Seal,</HI> what I had in a <HI>Manuscript</HI> of mine set down, as the <HI>Fact</HI> of what had passed between the late <HI>King</HI> and the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Commons</HI> concerning his <HI>Declaration of Indulgence</HI> on <HI>March</HI> the 15th, 1671. and the <HI>Penal</HI> Laws being thereby <HI>suspended</HI> (and the <HI>suspension</HI> of <HI>which</HI> the <HI>Commons</HI> then urged could not be but by <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament,</HI> and whereupon they <HI>apply'd</HI> to the <HI>King</HI> for the <HI>Vacating</HI> that <HI>Declaration</HI>) his Lordship did <HI>dictate</HI> to me in order to my <HI>Compleating</HI> the <HI>state</HI> of that <HI>Fact,</HI> and which I writ from his Mouth, as followeth, <HI>viz. But it is to be observ'd upon this whole Transaction between the King and the House of Commons, that the Lords had no hand in the Address to the King about this great Point; altho it be uncontroverted that the Lords are the only Iudicatory that can determine any controverted Point without an Act of Parliament, and either the King or the Commons might in a particular Case have had this Point brought by Appeal to the Lords, if they had pleas'd, and consequently might have effected the judicial decision of the same.</HI></P>

<P>No, but only against the <HI>Suspending</HI> them, which are things of a dif|ferent Nature. The same <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Commons</HI> by having <HI>Iuly</HI> the 10th, 1663. resolved, <HI>That His Majesty be humbly desired to issue forth his Proclamation for the punctual and effectual Execution and Observance of the Act of Navi|gation without any Dispensation whatsoever, whereby the Act may be in the least violated, and to recal such Dispensations as are already granted,</HI> &amp;c. did <HI>virtually</HI> shew a Deference to His Majesty's <HI>right</HI> of <HI>Dispensing.</HI> Nay, let me tell you, that the very many <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Parliaments</HI> which <HI>expresly</HI> pro|vide against the Crown's <HI>dispensing</HI> by <HI>Non-obstante</HI> in some <HI>particular</HI> Cases, may all be cited as <HI>Presidents</HI> or <HI>Iudgments</HI> of <HI>Parliaments</HI> for the propping up the <HI>Dispensative</HI> Power, and of Parliaments having <HI>admit|ted</HI> that <HI>Power</HI> in our Kings, the exercise of which they provide against and desire to take away in such particular Cases.</P>
<P>But by referring to the <HI>Fact</HI> of the entercourse between the late <HI>King</HI> and the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Commons</HI> about the <HI>suspending</HI> the Penal Laws, I have took occasion to point out to you the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of the <HI>Government</HI> in <HI>then</HI> pas|sing that affair over without a <HI>judicial</HI> decision. And I can give you an in|stance of the <HI>Prudential</HI> measures formerly observ'd by Persons who made a great figure in the Administration of the <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> Government of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> and who at the <HI>Consecration</HI> of Bishop <HI>Manwaring</HI> when on the usual Process at Consecrations to call all Persons to appear to shew cause why the Elect should not be Confirm'd, some then appear'd &amp; objected against

him, that upon his being <HI>Impeached</HI> 3^o <HI>Car.</HI> 1. by the <HI>Commons,</HI> the <HI>Lords</HI> had given <HI>Iudgment</HI> against him to <HI>disable</HI> him from all <HI>Preferment</HI> in the <HI>Church;</HI> forbore to consider the <HI>merits</HI> of the <HI>Exception,</HI> and throwing them off by a <HI>Pretence</HI> of their being <HI>defective</HI> in some <HI>Formalities</HI> of Law, went on in the <HI>Confirmation.</HI></P>
<P>And which is more, I can tell you that long afterward, <HI>viz.</HI> A. 1640. the <HI>Lords</HI> highly resenting both the <HI>Pardon</HI> and <HI>Bishoprick</HI> he had obtain'd, and calling to mind the <HI>Sentence</HI> they had pronounced against him, did on the 18th of <HI>April</HI> that year, <HI>refer</HI> the <HI>Consideration</HI> thereof to their Grand <HI>Committee</HI> for <HI>Privileges, it being also moved, that what can be alledged on the Lord Bishop of St.</HI> David'<HI>s part, either by Pardon, Licence or otherwise, may be produced and seen at the Sitting of the Lords Committees for their full and clear understanding, and better expedition in the business:</HI> and on the <HI>21st</HI> of <HI>April</HI> that <HI>year, order'd, that on the following</HI> Monday, <HI>the Records be brought into the House, that the House might determine the Cause,</HI> and on the <HI>27th</HI> of <HI>April</HI> following, <HI>order'd the Cause to be heard the next day,</HI> and upon which day some such <HI>fatal</HI> Sentence being <HI>expected</HI> against the <HI>Bishop,</HI> as, <HI>And his Bishoprick let another man take,</HI> by reason of his having been <HI>judicially</HI> disabled; His Majesty commanded that Bishop not to Sit in Parliament, nor send any <HI>Proxy</HI> thither: and the <HI>serment</HI> of the debate went off without any <HI>Iudgment</HI> given by the <HI>Lords</HI> that might touch <HI>Prerogative</HI> in the Point.</P>
<P>And if in the <HI>year</HI> 1640. when the <HI>air</HI> of mens <HI>fancies</HI> was so much in|fected with the <HI>Pestilence</HI> of <HI>Faction,</HI> so much <HI>tenderness</HI> was shewn to <HI>Prerogative</HI> (and that too in the Case of a <HI>Criminal</HI> whom the <HI>Commons</HI> had for so many years made the great object of their anger, as one whom they look'd on as a <HI>Proditor</HI> or Betrayer of his Country, and Betrayer of their <HI>Properties</HI>) the Loyal may well say <HI>quid non speremus,</HI> as to any future <HI>ferment</HI> that can rise in Parliament, being allay'd without <HI>Prejudice</HI> to the Crown.</P>
<P>The <HI>Iournals</HI> of Parliament in the Beginning of the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the First do tell us of the great ferment about the <HI>Pardon</HI> of Bishop <HI>Montague,</HI> whom the <HI>Commons</HI> had <HI>impeach'd</HI> before the <HI>Lords,</HI> and who after the <HI>Parliament</HI> was <HI>Prorogued</HI> to the 4th <HI>year</HI> of the <HI>reign</HI> of that <HI>Prince,</HI> had obtain'd his <HI>Pardon</HI> in the time of the <HI>Prorogation,</HI> and that such <HI>Pardon</HI> was by the Commons <HI>question'd,</HI> and that such <HI>questioning</HI> soon evaporated.</P>
<P>But according to that <HI>Great</HI> Saying of Sir <HI>Harry Martin</HI> in his <HI>Speech</HI> at a <HI>Conference</HI> between both Houses (as you will find it in <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">shworth</HI>) after he had mention'd the inconvenience of nice debates about <HI>the Original, La|titude and Bounds of Sovereign Power,</HI> viz. <HI>I have ever been of opinion that it is then best with Sovereign Power when it is had in tacit veneration, and not when it is prophaned by Publick Hearings and Examinations,</HI> you will find that it hath been the usual Practice of our great Loyal <HI>Patriots,</HI> in many <HI>Critical</HI> Conjunctures of time to prevent the <HI>popular</HI> Criticising on Controverted Points of Prerogative, and to provide for the ease both of Prince and People by giving no other <HI>rule</HI> in the <HI>Cause</HI> then the putting it off <HI>in longissimum diem.</HI></P>

Mr. <HI>Prynne</HI> had mentioned that Sir <HI>Iohn Winter,</HI> Mr. <HI>Wal|ter Mountague,</HI> Sir <HI>Maurice Drummond,</HI> and <HI>other Papists, were admitted in her Majesty's Service.</HI> But by what appears from Mr. <HI>Prynne</HI> in <HI>p.</HI> 80. in the following <HI>Parliament</HI> in the <HI>Second</HI> year of that <HI>King, the House of Commons took divers Examinations concerning Recusants that were in Office, and at last agreed on a Petition against Recusants in Office, and to present their Names therewith to the King to the end they might be removed:</HI> and He then saith, that <HI>Martis</HI> 6. <HI>Iunii</HI> 2. <HI>Car.

The Petition against Re|cusants in Authority was engrossed, read and allow'd to be presented to his Majesty, and this to be done by the Privy-Councel of the House, and Sir</HI> John F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">llerton, <HI>which was done accordingly: but with what real success, I can give no exact account.</HI></P>
<P>But that the <HI>disabling</HI> and other <HI>Laws</HI> against the <HI>Papists</HI> had been <HI>dis|pens'd</HI> with by the <HI>Royal Martyr</HI> as well as his <HI>Father,</HI> any one will conclude who reads what there followeth, <HI>viz. In this Parliament these ensuing Arti|cles against Popish Recusants were Consulted of in the House of Commons, with an Intent to draw them into an Act; and of which</HI> the 9th is, <HI>No Recusant to bear Office of Iustice of Peace or otherwise, or any man whose Wife shall be a Recusant, or practice Law, Common, or Civil, or Physick, nor have Command in War,</HI> &amp;c. And I should first have told you that the <HI>Third</HI> was, <HI>A New Oath with more Additions to be taken concerning the Supremacy.</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good God! <HI>A new Oath with more Additions about the Supre|macy!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may suppose it would have been seemingly a <HI>New</HI> Oath by that <HI>Parliament</HI>'s approving all the Authentick <HI>Regal</HI> Interpretations of the <HI>old</HI> one, as Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Interpretation was <HI>approved</HI> by her <HI>Par|liament.</HI></P>
<P>But you may here observe, that tho the <HI>Disabling</HI> and other <HI>Penal</HI> Laws were by this Pious Prince tacitly and often <HI>dispens'd</HI> with, and the <HI>time</HI> of the doing of it caus'd some temporary <HI>ferments</HI> to arise in the Minds of his Subjects in <HI>Parliament,</HI> yet their animosities have soon <HI>tacitly</HI> evaporated, and the <HI>Regal</HI> Power of <HI>Dispensing</HI> then came to no <HI>question.</HI> The <HI>Puritan</HI> Dissenters and <HI>scruplers</HI> of <HI>Ceremonies,</HI> knew they wanted the benefit of that <HI>Power</HI> as well as the <HI>Papists:</HI> and the <HI>exercise</HI> of that <HI>Power</HI> was in the <HI>Petition</HI> of both <HI>Houses</HI> before mention'd <HI>implored</HI> as to the disabled or <HI>silenced</HI> Ministers. And therefore you will not wonder at it when I tell you
<PB N="104" REF="56">
that during all the great Patriotly <HI>efforts</HI> that were made for the removing all <HI>Grievances</HI> by the <HI>Petition</HI> of <HI>Right,</HI> there was no offence taken at the Right of the <HI>Dispensative</HI> Power.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you for that observation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>The thought is too <HI>obvious</HI> to deserve thanks: and I assure you it is a kind of <HI>Proverbial</HI> Saying in the <HI>Canon</HI> Law, that <HI>Dispensationum modus nulli Sapientum displicuit.</HI></P>
<P>But even in the <HI>Conjuncture</HI> of the <HI>Petition of Right,</HI> to shew you that the <HI>Dispensative</HI> Power did not in the least contribute to the <HI>ferment,</HI> I shall let you see out of <HI>Rushworth</HI> how Mr. <HI>Glanvile</HI> (who made so great a <HI>figure</HI> of a <HI>Patriot</HI> then in <HI>Parliament</HI>) did with the greatest popular applause appear as an <HI>Assertor</HI> of that Power, and when in his <HI>Speech</HI> in a full <HI>Committee</HI> of both <HI>Houses (May</HI> 23. <HI>A.</HI> 1628.) he <HI>inter alia</HI> said, <HI>There is a Trust insepa|rably reposed in the Persons of the Kings of</HI> England; <HI>but that Trust is regu|lated by Law: For example, when Statutes are made to Prohibit things not</HI> mala in se, <HI>but only</HI> mala quia Prohibita, <HI>under certain Forfeitures and Pe|nalties to accrue to the King and to the Informers that shall sue for the breach of them, the Commons must and ever will acknowledge a Regal and Soveraign Prerogative in the King touching such Statutes, that it is in his Majesty's absolute and undoubted Power to grant Dispensations to particular Persons, with the Clauses of</HI> Non-obstante <HI>to do as they might have done before those Statutes, wherein his Majesty conferring Grace and Favour upon some, doth not do wrong to others. But there is a difference between those Statutes and the Laws and Statutes whereon the Petition is grounded. By those Statutes the Subject hath no interest in the Penalties which are all the fruit such Sta|tutes can produce, until by Sute or Information he become entituled to the particular Forfeitures; whereas the Laws and Statutes mention'd in our Peti|tion are of another Nature. There shall your Lordships find us to rely upon the good old Statute called</HI> Magna Charta, <HI>which declareth and confirmeth the ancient Common Laws of the Liberties of</HI> England: and there he speaks afterward of <HI>other Statute Laws not inflicting Penalties upon Offenders</HI> in malis prohibitis, <HI>but Laws declarative or positive, conferring or confirming</HI> ipso facto <HI>an inherent Right and Interest of liberty and freedom in the Sub|jects of this Realm, as their Birth-rights and Inheritances descendable to their Heirs and Posterities, the Statutes incorporate into the Body of the Common Law; over which (with reverence be it spoken) there is no Trust reposed in the King's Soveraign Power or Prerogative Royal to enable him to dispense with them, or to take from his Subjects the Birthright which they have in their Liberties, by virtue of the Common Law.</HI></P>
<P>So then according to the sense of this <HI>loyal</HI> Patriot, if the King shall by his Prerogative <HI>dispense</HI> with the <HI>Disabilities</HI> or <HI>Premunires</HI> or other <HI>Penalties</HI> incurr'd by <HI>Popish</HI> Recusants pursuant to any <HI>Statutes;</HI> as for example, those of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> or King <HI>Iames,</HI> and even that of 3^o <HI>Iac.</HI> c. 5. <HI>whereby Convicted Recusants are disabled from Military Offices, and Offices in the Navy, and in the Law, and f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">m the Practice of Phy|sick, and any publick Office and Charge in the Commonwealth,</HI> or the <HI>Test-Act</HI> 25^o <HI>Car.</HI> 2. No question is to be made of the King's <HI>absolute and undoubted Power of dispensing with particular persons in such a Case.</HI></P>
<P>And during the <HI>ferment</HI> about <HI>the Laws and Statutes</HI> whereon the <HI>Peti|tion of Right</HI> was founded (and which <HI>were of another Nature,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Glan|vile</HI>'s words are) you will not forget that there was a <HI>tenderness</HI> for <HI>Prero|gative</HI> avow'd by <HI>both Houses,</HI> while you remember those words of the <HI>Royal Martyr</HI> in his <HI>Speech</HI> at the <HI>Prorogation</HI> of the <HI>Parliament</HI> the 20th of <HI>October,</HI> A. 1628. viz. <HI>That the Profession of both Houses at the time of ham|mering</HI>

<HI>the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">tition of Right was no way to entrench upon his Prer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">gative;</HI> and their saying <HI>that they had neither intention no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> power to hurt it,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>You may too call to mind that as during the <HI>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">rment</HI> that the <HI>suspending</HI> the <HI>Penal</HI> Laws by His late Majesty's <HI>Declaration</HI> of <HI>Indulgence&punc;</HI> his Power of <HI>Dispensing</HI> in them came not in <HI>question,</HI> so the <HI>heat</HI> about his <HI>Preregative</HI> to <HI>SUSPEND</HI> them was soon over.</P>
<P>The <HI>Opinion</HI> of that <HI>loyal</HI> Patriot and <HI>learned</HI> and upright <HI>Iustitiary</HI> Sir <HI>William Ellis</HI> deliver'd in his <HI>Argument</HI> about <HI>Thomas</HI> and <HI>Sorrells</HI> Case I told you of namely that <HI>the King may SUSPEND an Act of Parliament till next Session</HI> (which was a fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ght beyond what was moved for or adjudged in the late Case of <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">dden</HI> and <HI>Hales</HI>) did never meet with any angry refle|ction (that I have heard of) from any Person either of the People <HI>diffusive</HI> or <HI>representative,</HI> tho yet that <HI>Argument</HI> of his containing such <HI>Opinion</HI> was both after the <HI>Votes</HI> of the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Commons</HI> about the <HI>illegality</HI> of the <HI>suspending</HI> of <HI>Penal</HI> Laws in Matters Eccle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">iastical otherwise then by <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament,</HI> and after the <HI>Act</HI> for the <HI>Test.</HI></P>
<P>And how near the Prerogative of <HI>Dispensing</HI> as allow'd by my Lord Chief Justice <HI>Vaughan</HI> in his <HI>Argument</HI> in <HI>Thomas</HI> and <HI>Sorrell</HI>'s Case, (and who ar|gued after Sir <HI>W. Ellis</HI>) came up to <HI>SUSPENDING,</HI> you may see there by what he saith, <HI>p.</HI> 347&punc; <HI>Where the King can dispense with particular Per|sons, he is not confined to number or place, but may Lice<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s, as many, and in such Places as he thinks fit.</HI></P>
<P>But further to shew you to how quiet and temperate a State that <HI>ferment</HI> of the Prince's <HI>suspending</HI> all the Religionary <HI>Penal</HI> Laws without an <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> was grown, I shall let you see that several <HI>years</HI> after the <HI>late</HI> King's <HI>Declaration of Indulgence</HI> and the <HI>Act</HI> for the <HI>Test,</HI> the late <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">aftsbury</HI> appear'd in Print as owning the <HI>legality</HI> of the King's <HI>Prer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ga|tive</HI> in that kind, and without his Lordship's being in the least censured for it by any of that num<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">rous Party he was then the Head of.</P>
<P>And here I am to tell you, that in a Book call'd <HI>A Letter from a Person of Quality to his Friend in the Country,</HI> Printed in the <HI>year</HI> 1675. the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> is by Mr. <HI>Marvell</HI> the supposed <HI>Author</HI> of the <HI>Book,</HI> introduced as owning that <HI>the Power of the King's Supremacy</HI> (meaning in Matters Ec|clesiastical) <HI>was of another Nature then that he had in Civils, and had been exercised without exception in this very Case (i. e.</HI> as in the Declaration of Indulgence) <HI>by his Father, Grandfather, and Queen</HI> Elizabeth, <HI>under the Great Seal to foreign Protestants become Subjects of</HI> England, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> then in the <HI>year</HI> 1675. own the <HI>Preroga|tive</HI> of <HI>suspending</HI> Penal Laws in Matters <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> when the <HI>King</HI> had long before <HI>quitted</HI> it, and when his Lordship was Embarqued with those Men to whom nothing could once seem more unpopular then the owning of any such <HI>Prerogative?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I refer you to the <HI>Book</HI> it self, and where you will see that that Great <HI>Statesman</HI> did then assert the <HI>extent</HI> of <HI>Prerogative</HI> in that Point, with as much strength of <HI>Wit</HI> and <HI>Reason,</HI> as if he had been then <HI>fitting</HI> at the <HI>Helm of State:</HI> and where he further shews <HI>the Necessity of a standing Su|preme executive Power to mitigate or wholy to SUSPEND the execution of any Penal Laws,</HI> &amp;c. But I shall best entertain you with his Lordship's own words as so great a <HI>Narrator</HI> as Mr. <HI>Marvell</HI> relates them, and who (as he saith) telling his Lordship that <HI>the Declaration of Indulgence assumed a Power to repeal and SUSPEND all our Laws, his Lordship <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">eplyed, that he won|der'd at his Objection, there being not one of these in the Case. For the King assumed no Power of repealing Laws, or suspending them contrary to the will of his Parliament, or People; and not to argue with me at that time the Power of</HI>
<PB N="106" REF="57">
<HI>the King's Supremacy, which was of another Nature then that he had in Civils, and had been exercised without exception in this very Case by his Father, Grandfather, and Queen</HI> Elizabeth, <HI>under the Great Seal to foreign Prote|stants become Subjects of</HI> England, <HI>nor to instance in the SUSPENDING the execution of the two Acts of Navigation, and Trade during both this and the last</HI> Dutch <HI>War, in the same words and upon the same necessity, and as yet without clamour that ever we heard. But to pass by all that, this is certain, a Government could not be supposed whether Monarchical, or other of any sort, without a standing Supreme executive Power fully enabled to mitigate, or WHOLT to SUSPEND the execution of any Penal Law in the inter|vals of the Legislative Power: which when assembled there was no doubt, but wherever there lies a Negative in passing of a Law, there the Address or sense known of either of them to the Contrary (as for instance of either of our two Houses of Parliament in</HI> England) <HI>ought to determine that Indul|gence, and restore the Law to its full execution. For without this the Laws were to no purpose made, if the Prince could annul them at pleasure, and so on the other hand without a Power always in being of dispensing on occasion, was to suppose a Constitution extremely imperfect, and impracticable, and to Cure those with a Legislative Power always in being, is when consider'd no other then a perfect Tyranny.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find that his <HI>Lordship</HI> doth not in the least <HI>distinguish</HI> between the Right of Prerogative in <HI>suspending</HI> the <HI>Disabling</HI> or <HI>incapacitating</HI> Penal Laws, and others. And he by giving the Power of <HI>suspending</HI> all the <HI>Pe|nal</HI> Laws to the Prince <HI>during the Intervals of Parliament,</HI> and till an <HI>Ad|dress</HI> should be thence made to the Prince to <HI>revoke</HI> such <HI>suspension,</HI> hath given his Prince this Power in effect <HI>during</HI> life. For 'tis obvious to consi|der by how many accidents a <HI>suspension</HI> of Penal Laws <HI>revocable</HI> on an <HI>Address</HI> from the Parliament, may happen to be not so <HI>revoked.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>You say right. The King may thus according to his Lordship's <HI>Opinion</HI> suspend all Penal <HI>Disabilities</HI> as well as other <HI>Penalties</HI> incurr'd by <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Parliament,</HI> and particularly by the <HI>Test-Act</HI> of 25^o <HI>Car.</HI> 2. and hereby to the Great figure he made in the framing of that <HI>Act,</HI> any who are displeas'd with the <HI>Act,</HI> may apply the <HI>Una eademque manus,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I suppose his Lordship there has nothing that may favour the <HI>repealing</HI> of the <HI>Test,</HI> or any of the <HI>Penal</HI> Laws against the <HI>Papists.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>None would expect from him anything to be moved for the repealing of the <HI>Test;</HI> however he allow'd <HI>Prerogative</HI> to <HI>suspend</HI> it. But at that time that all People of narrow Souls and ignoble Thoughts were with so much clamour hunting down all <HI>Roman-Catholicks</HI> without <HI>distinction,</HI> and when the most devout among them by being (as it were) <HI>ad bestias dam|nati</HI> and devoured by <HI>Informers,</HI> appear'd as a <HI>spectacle</HI> of delight to many inhumane Protestants, his Lordship's <HI>humanity</HI> was so great as to incline him in <HI>p.</HI> 6. there to give them somewhat like a <HI>Quietus</HI> from all <HI>Pecuniary</HI> Laws. And the truth is when I consider how little <HI>Wool</HI> the <HI>fleecing</HI> of <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> and <HI>Quakers</HI> or any <HI>Heterodox</HI> Religionaries at home or abroad hath brought to the Exchequer of any <HI>Prince</HI> or <HI>State,</HI> and only to <HI>Informers,</HI> and that the Consciences of peaceable Men have been burden'd by Men of no Conscience, and by the <HI>turba gravis paci</HI> who are indeed burthens of the Earth, I tremble to think what occasion may have been taken by Male-contents to say in their Hearts as to any such Prince or State, according to those words of the Psalmist, <HI>Thou sellest thy People for nought, and dost not encrease thy Wealth by their Price,</HI> or <HI>and takest no Money for them.</HI> I shall at some other time of our meeting give you some account cut of the <HI>Records</HI> of the <HI>Exchequer</HI> of the inconsiderable <HI>Sums</HI> of <HI>Money,</HI>
<PB N="107" REF="57">
that have for several years been brought to it by the severe Prosecutions of <HI>Roman-Catholicks</HI> and <HI>Quakers.</HI></P>
<P>But there is another thing very well worth your reading in that <HI>Book,</HI> and which is the more proper for our Consideration as suiting some great Points we have been discoursing that concern our Oath, and that is this; H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ate</HI> Majesty's <HI>Ministers</HI> in that year 1675. having brought in a <HI>Bill</HI> in Parliament for a <HI>TEST</HI> extending to <HI>Protestants</HI> (and which as the <HI>Book</HI> saith, was call'd by one of His Majesty's Ministers, <HI>A moderate Security to the Church and Crown</HI>) you will there in <HI>p.</HI> 15. see it mentioned how as to the <HI>Assertory</HI> Parts of the <HI>Oath</HI> in that <HI>Test, It was worthy the Conside|ration of the Bishops whether Assertory Oaths which were properly appointed to give Testimony of a Matter of Fact w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ereof a man is capable to be fully assured by the evidence of his Senses be lawfully to be made use of to confirm or in|validate Doc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">inal Propositions, and whether that Legislative Power which imposeth such an Oath, doth not necessarily assume to it seif an Infallibility? And as for promissory Oaths, it was desired that those learned Prelates would consider the Opinion of</HI> Grotius De Jure Belli &amp; Pacis, <HI>l.</HI> 2. <HI>c.</HI> 13. <HI>who seems to make it plain that those kind of Oaths are forbidden by our Saviour Christ,</HI> Matth. 5. 34, 37. <HI>and whether it would not become the Fathers of the Church when they have well wei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">h'd that and other places of the New Testament, to be more tender in multiplying Oaths then hitherto the great Men of the Church have been?</HI> It is there toward the end of the <HI>page</HI> mentioned how <HI>some of the Lords d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">sired that it might be clearly known whether it were meant all for an Oath, or some of it a Declaration, and some an Oath? If the latter, then it was desired it might be distinctly parted, and that the declaratory part should be subscribed by it self and not sworn. There was no small pains taken by the Lord Keeper and the Bishops to prove that it was brought in; the two first Parts were only a Declaration, and not an Oath: and tho it was re|ply'd, that to declare upon ones Oath, or to abhor upon ones Oath, is the same thing with, I do Swear, yet there was some difficulty to obtain the dividing of them, and that the declaratory part should be only Subscribed, and the re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">t sworn to.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>But have you mention'd these things, as if you would incline me to concur in opinion with that <HI>Lord</HI> as to the King's Power of <HI>suspending</HI> the <HI>Penalties</HI> incurr'd by <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Parliament,</HI> and to agree with the Measures of some other <HI>Lords</HI> then about Oaths <HI>assertory</HI> and <HI>promissory,</HI> as re|ferr'd to?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I were of the same opinion about the King's Power in that Matter, as that <HI>Lord</HI> and Sir <HI>William Ellis</HI> were, I would however forbear troubling you with it at this time while we are considering the <HI>Obligation</HI> of our <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Supremacy</HI> in order to our assistance and defence of the <HI>Preheminence</HI> of the <HI>Dispensative</HI> Power. And therefore I shall not in the least <HI>endeavour</HI> to <HI>incline</HI> you now to imbibe the <HI>perswasion</HI> of any nice <HI>Controverted</HI> point of <HI>Law</HI> or <HI>Theology,</HI> and wherein there seems <HI>probab lis causa litigandi.</HI> And if when we are parted, you on your recollection of our Discourse at this or our first meeting, should have the least trouble by calling to mind any thing I have occasionally mention'd that is matter of <HI>Controversie,</HI> you may with all my heart put it off with a temporary <HI>transeat</HI> from your thoughts.</P>
<P>But one of my aims in referring to that <HI>Opinion</HI> of his <HI>Lordship</HI> was, That knowing you to be much concern'd for the <HI>ease</HI> and <HI>quiet</HI> of your <HI>Prince</HI> and <HI>Country,</HI> I might <HI>Console</HI> you with an <HI>Instance</HI> of a great <HI>ferment</HI> about the <HI>Regal</HI> Power, suddenly going off: and as that Book too shew'd you that another did in the Government that was occasion'd by the new <HI>Test-Bill</HI> then introduced.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="58">And I must tell you that <HI>another</HI> of my <HI>aims</HI> in my pointing you to his Lord|ship's Observation of the <HI>Suspensions</HI> of the <HI>Penal</HI> Statutes in the late <HI>Reigns,</HI> was occasionally to direct you to a <HI>tenderness</HI> for the <HI>Regal</HI> Rights in gene|ral, and for the <HI>undoubted</HI> Right of the <HI>Dispensative</HI> Power in Particular. The same thing likewise hath been my <HI>aim</HI> in the several <HI>Presidents</HI> I have given you of the <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> Power by Queen <HI>Elizabeth&punc;</HI> King <HI>Iames,</HI> and King <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>First</HI> exercised in <HI>suspending</HI> Penal Laws.</P>
<P>The expression of <HI>tenderness</HI> for the <HI>Rights</HI> of our <HI>Princes</HI> hath been much <HI>used</HI> by the loyal <HI>Patriot'y</HI> Writers in the late Reigns: And here <HI>I</HI> shall <HI>&agrave; propos</HI> apply it, as the <HI>Resuscitatio,</HI> Part. 1. p. 37. mentions it as used by my Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> in a <HI>Speech</HI> in the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Commons</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Iames</HI> the <HI>First,</HI> to the <HI>Question</HI> now before us in the <HI>Reign</HI> of King <HI>Iames</HI> the <HI>Second.</HI> His Lordships words are, <HI>Since therefore we have a Prince of so excellent Wisdom and Moderation, of whose Authority we ought to be TENDER as he is likewise of our Liberty, let us enter into a true and indifferent Consideration how far forth the Case in question may touch his Authority, and how far forth our Liberty. And to speak clearly, in my opinion, it concerns his Authority much, and our Liberty nothing at all.</HI></P>
<P>That Expression concerning <HI>tenderness</HI> for the <HI>Regal</HI> Rights was very ac|ceptable to the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Commons,</HI> when his <HI>late</HI> Majesty in his <HI>Letter</HI> to them from <HI>Bredagh, April</HI> 14. 1660, thus made use of it, <HI>viz. We have not the least doubt but you will be as TENDER in and jealous of any thing that may infringe our Honour and Authority, as of your own Liberty and Property, which is best preserv'd by preserving the other.</HI></P>
<P>Remember therefore that your <HI>tenderness</HI> for <HI>Property</HI> is best preserv'd by your <HI>tenderness</HI> for the Regal Authority: and if you would have your <HI>thoughts</HI> adorn'd by a constant <HI>Idea</HI> of true <HI>English</HI> Loyalty like a noble <HI>Picture</HI> retain'd there, let me direct you to a Saying, which like an <HI>Original</HI> drawn by a great Master, may be fit for you to <HI>Copy</HI> after, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>Saying</HI> of the Lord Keeper <HI>Coventry</HI> in a <HI>Speech</HI> in the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Lords,</HI> viz. <HI>Some would have the King's Prerogative rather tall then great; others</HI> &egrave; contra. <HI>But none can be truly loyal, but he that is a good Patriot, and none can be a good Patriot, but he that is truly loyal.</HI></P>
<P>Nor need it be further insinuated to you, that without your keeping up a <HI>tenderness</HI> for the <HI>Regal</HI> Rights, you cannot maintain your tenderness for <HI>Oaths.</HI> And here I must take occasion to tell you that one of my <HI>aims</HI> in entertaining you with the <HI>Queries</HI> relating to <HI>Oaths</HI> out of that <HI>Book,</HI> was to lay before your thoughts a <HI>tenderness</HI> as to <HI>Oaths</HI> in general, both in <HI>keeping</HI> the lawful ones you have taken, and in not <HI>imposing</HI> unlawful, doubtful, un|necessary, or <HI>inexpedient</HI> ones on others; and on such as our <HI>Prince</HI> consi|dering the several Constitutions of their minds both as to firmness and infirmness, hath thought fit to exempt from taking such <HI>strong Physick.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover if you will think that another of my <HI>aims</HI> was to mind you that the same <HI>Queries</HI> might have been as ingeniously and ingenuously put in the <HI>year</HI> 1673. before the passing of the <HI>Test-Act,</HI> as they were in debating the <HI>Test-Bill</HI> in the <HI>year</HI> 1675, I shall allow you so to do.</P>
<P>You may too (if you will) here <HI>occasionally</HI> consider how soon <HI>God</HI> in the course of his Providence doth sometimes turn the Tables, and make such who were lately so active in imposing on others <HI>Oaths</HI> that seem'd doubtful and oppressive to them, to be in danger of suffering by the like Impositions. Mr. <HI>Burrough</HI>'s a Pious Independent <HI>Divine</HI> (who lived in the late times) referring in his <HI>Irenicum</HI> to the Impositions and Persecution de|sign'd by the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> against those of his Perswasion, saith there, <HI>but</HI>
<PB N="109" REF="58">
<HI>the Tables may turn one day, wherein the Sufferers shall have the greatest Ease, and the Inflicters the sorest Burthen. But God forbid that their Bre|thren should lay it upon them, tho it were put into their Power to do it.</HI> And you may take notice that the <HI>Book</HI> we before spoke of, owns the Activity of the <HI>Roman-Catholick Lords</HI> then in hindering that <HI>Test</HI>'s being brought on <HI>Protestants:</HI> the Consideration whereof may (I think) justly incline all, who account it their Happiness to have been freed from that design'd <HI>Oath,</HI> not to grudge at the favour that hath been extended by the <HI>Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">pensative</HI> Power to <HI>particular</HI> Roman-Catholicks excused from taking other Oaths: or at any <HI>just</HI> favour if ever <HI>happening</HI> to be afforded them by the Au|thentick <HI>Interpretation</HI> of what in the <HI>Statute-Oaths</HI> seems <HI>doubtful</HI> to them.</P>
<P>So tender was the Government in the time of <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>6th,</HI> about the not making the <HI>Consciences</HI> of the People uneasie by <HI>Oaths,</HI> that you will find it in the <HI>Reformation of the Ecclesiastical Laws</HI> begun in <HI>Harry</HI> the <HI>8th</HI>'s Reign, and carry'd on in his, that the <HI>Magna nomina</HI> who were employ'd to make a New Body of <HI>Laws,</HI> did in Compassion to the Consciences of those who took the usual <HI>Promissory</HI> Oaths for the observance of the <HI>Statutes</HI> of <HI>Universities,</HI> Collegiate Churches, and such like Societies and Corporations, order this <HI>Clause</HI> to be added to the <HI>Oaths,</HI> viz. <HI>Haec omnibus partibus servabo, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">uibus cum sacr&acirc; Scriptur&acirc;, cum legibus civilibus, &amp; Ecclesiasticis hujus Regni consentient, &amp; quantum vires meae patientur.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The School-men</HI> (saith one) <HI>would be thought most tender and most curious in the point of Oaths.

<P>Notwithstanding what I told you out of my Lord <HI>Coke,</HI> that an <HI>Oath can|not be ministred to any unless the same be allow'd by the Common Law, or by some Act of Parliament&punc; neither can any Oath allow'd by the Common Law or by Act of Parliament, be alter'd, but by Act of Parliament;</HI> yet as you know that the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Commons</HI> in the 30th <HI>year</HI> of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> desiring <HI>that no Oath or Subscription might be tendred to any at their entrance into the Ministry, but such as is expresly prescribed by the Statutes of this Realm, except the Oath against Corrupt entring,</HI> did thereby however <HI>approve</HI> of the tendring of that Oath, so my Lord <HI>Coke</HI> likewise, <HI>Inst.</HI> 3. c. 71. viz. <HI>Of Simony</HI> seems to <HI>approve</HI> of that <HI>Oath,</HI> in saying that <HI>Simony is the more odious, be|cause it is accompany'd with Perjury, for the Presentee,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>is Sworn to com|mit no Simony, referring there to</HI> Lynwood, and had before in that <HI>Chapter</HI> referr'd to <HI>Canon</HI> 40. 1 <HI>Iacobi</HI> 1603. <HI>The Oath against Simony.</HI></P>
<P>You may too remember what I so lately told you of my Lord <HI>Coke</HI>'s ha|ving with some approbation, or fair respect mention'd the <HI>Clergy's</HI> Oath of <HI>Canonical</HI> obedience.</P>
<P>And I can tell you that I lately looking on the <HI>Charter</HI> of the <HI>Corpora|tion of Shipwrights,</HI> granted by King <HI>Iames</HI> the First in the Tenth year of his Reign, observed therein that <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Ellesmere</HI> Lord Chancellor of <HI>England,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Flemming</HI> Lord Chief Justice of <HI>England,</HI> Sir <HI>Edward Coke</HI> Lord Chief Justice of the <HI>Common Pleas,</HI> did pursuant to the <HI>Statute</HI> in the 19th <HI>year</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the 7th <HI>allow and approve</HI> under their <HI>Ha ds</HI> and <HI>Seals</HI> divers <HI>Articles, Acts,</HI> and <HI>Ordinances</HI> for <HI>the better Order, Rule, and Government of the Art or Mystery of Shipwrights</HI> exhibited to them by the Corporation, and did moreover <HI>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">in</HI> the <HI>form</HI> of three new <HI>Oaths</HI> to be taken by the <HI>Officers</HI> and <HI>Freemen</HI> of that <HI>Corporation,</HI> and did <HI>DISABLE</HI> the Refusers of such <HI>Oath</HI> to be Members of the Corporation.</P>

<P>You may too as justly say what a <HI>terrible</HI> thing <HI>is it</HI> that so many Protestants who have formerly by the frequent swallowing the Poison of Contradictory <HI>Oaths,</HI> habituated themselves to the quiet concocting of all Oaths (as the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Pontus</HI> brought himself at last to digest all Poisons) will yet be so ready to endeavour to compel the Consciences of others to swallow such <HI>Oaths</HI> that they believe or suspect to be poisonous; a thing that hath probably tended to make so many among us to <HI>Nauseate</HI> the use of all <HI>Oaths</HI> as unlawful.</P>

<P><HI>Alexander ab Alexandro,</HI> l. 5. tells us, that there was no <HI>use</HI> of <HI>Oaths</HI> among the <HI>Phrygians.</HI> And tho <HI>Grotius</HI> saith in his <HI>De jure Belli &amp; Pacis,</HI> that <HI>jure gentium testi injurato non creditur,</HI> yet it was by <HI>Polybius</HI> ob|serv'd that in the better and simpler <HI>Ages</HI> of the World <HI>Oaths</HI> were sel|dom used in <HI>Iudicatures.</HI> The <HI>Athenians</HI> would not suffer <HI>Xenocrates</HI> a Person of known Probity to take his Oath at the <HI>Altar,</HI> as a thing below his reputation. <HI>Gellius,</HI> l. 10. c. 15. saith, <HI>Verba Proetoris ex edicto perpetuo</HI>

<P><HI>Iosephus</HI> relates it, that the <HI>Essenes</HI> Word was as sure as an <HI>Oath.</HI> So great likewise was the reputation of the <HI>Christians</HI> in the <HI>Ancient</HI> times for truth in Matters <HI>asserted</HI> or <HI>promised</HI> by them, that the Saying of <HI>Christianus sum</HI> did frequently pass currant for the <HI>Cautio Iuratoria.</HI> And I shall always with reverence think of <HI>Bellarmine</HI>'s <HI>Tutissimum,</HI> and of S. <HI>Austin</HI>'s <HI>Nullum Iuramentum tutum.</HI></P>
<P>A late ingenious <HI>Writer</HI> apply'd to the Clergy's obtaining <HI>Canons</HI> for their not <HI>Marrying,</HI> the Observation <HI>that they always knew what was good for themselves;</HI> but I shall think it more <HI>applicable</HI> to what I read of in the <HI>Book</HI> of Mr. <HI>Ley</HI> beforementioned, <HI>p.</HI> 112. that <HI>as S.</HI> Basil <HI>was very zealous in behalf of Bishops that they might not be put to swear in respect of the Peril of an Oath, so he prevail'd so far as to free them from that Peril: and that the Council of</HI> Challons, <HI>Can.</HI> 18. <HI>was thus favorable to Presbyters: and that the</HI> Triburiensian <HI>Council favour'd them with this Constitution, that a Presbyter should not be compell'd to swear, but instead of an Oath, he should be question'd upon his</HI> Holy <HI>Consecration</HI> in verbo sacerdotis: <HI>because (as the reason is there rendred) Our Lord forbad his Disciples to Swear.</HI></P>
<P>And I shall tell you, that if you will allow <HI>Lawyers</HI> to <HI>know</HI> what is <HI>good</HI> for themselves, you will find them of all sorts of men to have the greatest aversion against being <HI>Witnesses.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Iesuites</HI> too, who are by all reputed <HI>wise in their Generation,</HI> are by Dr. <HI>Donne</HI> in his <HI>Pseudo-Martyr,</HI> p. 350. referred to as having so <HI>extraordi|nary</HI> an <HI>aversion</HI> against <HI>Oaths,</HI> that he cites the <HI>Spongia pro Iesuit,</HI> p. 79. for their <HI>out-doing</HI> the <HI>Essenes</HI> in <HI>hyperbolical Detestations of Oaths.</HI></P>

<P>And as by the <HI>Clemency</HI> of His <HI>Majesty</HI>'s Government, <HI>Quakers</HI> there ma|king Answer upon their <HI>Oath</HI> to <HI>Captious</HI> Bills hath been to the general Sa|tisfaction of the compassionate Just (as it were) <HI>tacitly</HI> dispens'd with, and as likewise their <HI>Promissory</HI> Oaths of Allegiance have been, I doubt not but his <HI>express</HI> or <HI>tacit</HI> dispensing with other Loyal and Conscientious particu|lar Persons doubting of the lawfulness or expedience of some <HI>Promissory</HI> Oaths, will be as generally grateful.</P>

<P>Your having (as it were) <HI>diverted</HI> me by the thought of that <HI>Su|perstition</HI> of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> brings to my mind the pleasant Entertainment you once gave me by lending me a <HI>Book</HI> writ long ago, call'd <HI>A brief Treatise of Oaths exacted by Ordinaries and Ecclesiastical Iudges to answer generally to all such Articles or Interrogarories as pleaseth them to propound: and of their forced and Constrained Oaths</HI> ex officio, <HI>wherein is proved that the same are unlawful.</HI> And I remember much of the matter in that Author being dull, I came to somewhat at last recited by him, that had in it some <HI>Sales,</HI> or what I may call some drops of <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Vitriol,</HI> and which were but necessary to give a grateful <HI>acidity</HI> to his <HI>Apozeme,</HI> when he toward the end of that <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Oaths,</HI> in <HI>p.</HI> 56. and 57. thus brings in a <HI>RATIO|NALE</HI> of the <HI>Ceremonious</HI> manner of giving an Oath, and of the Manufa|cture of it as some men do <HI>fidem facere</HI> by it, <HI>viz. For in this matter of an Oath they have devised according to their toying fantasie a certain foolish figurative Ceremony in the ministring thereof. For the Deponent for sooth must lay his three middle Fingers stretch'd outright upon the Book in significa|tion of the Holy Trinity and Catholick Faith, and his Thumb and little Fin|ger he must put downward under the Book, in token of Damnation both of Body and Soul, if he say not the truth. The Thumb belike as the greater, repre|senting the heavy mass of the Body: and the little Finger the light and in|corpo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">eal substance of the Soul. How superstitious also they were concerning this Ceremony of the Book (little regarding the true use and end of an Oath) as appears by the Allegorical Exposition curiously set forth by one of their Per|sonate and Counterfeit Prelates, who saith that the Circumstances in the Act of an Oath are very great and weighty, inasmuch as he that Sweareth by a Book doth three things: First as tho he should say, Let that which is written in the Book never do me good, neither the new nor the old Law if I lye in this mine Oath. Secondly, he puts his Hand on the Book, as tho he should say, Nor the good work which I have done profit me ought before the face of Christ, except I say the truth which is founded in Christ. Thirdly, he kisseth the Book, as tho he should say, Let never the Prayers and Petitions which by my mouth I have utter'd, avail me any thing to my Soul's health, if I say not truly in this mine Oath. Yet you must take this as meant only by this Reve|rend Father where Lay men, or the baser sort of the Clergy take an Oath. For that blessed</HI> Bonner <HI>not long since hath taught us this trick of his Law, that a Bishop may Swear (such is his Privilege</HI>) inspectis Evangeliis &amp; non tactis; <HI>bare sight of the Book without touch or kiss, will well enough serve his Lordship's turn.</HI></P>

<P>Well Sir, throwing out of our thoughts the <HI>minutioe</HI> of all formal tri|fling&punc; let us not at the same time try to make men <HI>laugh</HI> and weep by im|posing Oaths on them. And let the Consideration of this, namely that the <HI>Noble</HI> Morals enjoyn'd by the <HI>Christian</HI> Doctrine have not prevailed all this while to secure <HI>Christians</HI> against one another without the <HI>Garranty</HI> of Oaths, or by the <HI>Christianus sum</HI> not being still judged <HI>oequi-ponderous</HI> with an Oath, impress a solemn grief on our Minds. And considering that both the <HI>Verbum Regium,</HI> and the <HI>verbum Sacerdotis</HI> have been so much allow'd <HI>equal</HI> to <HI>Oaths,</HI> and that all <HI>Christians</HI> ought to <HI>value</HI> themselves on being <HI>A Royal Priesthood,</HI> and on their great <HI>Chief</HI> having <HI>made them Kings and Priests to God and his Father,</HI> let us bemoan the present State of Christia|nity and <HI>Christians,</HI> having (as it were) <HI>Decreed</HI> it that they cannot take one anothers words. And let the thought likewise of the <HI>insufficiency</HI> of
<PB N="113" REF="60">
the <HI>Security</HI> of Oaths themselves to keep up <HI>Governments,</HI> work in us such a serious Mortification and Profound sense of the <HI>degeneracy</HI> of Mankind, and such an inclination to place our chief Confidence in somewhat above the words, or Oaths of men, as becomes us.</P>
<P>But I shall give you an <HI>instance</HI> of this at <HI>home</HI> too pregnant with hor|ror. Our thoughts have had a long melancholy <HI>walk</HI> in the <HI>Peristyllium</HI> of the many <HI>Interpretations</HI> that supported our Great <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Supremacy,</HI> and as to which Oath it being probable that a <HI>vulgar</HI> Error having prevailed among many of the <HI>Faction</HI> for some time before the <HI>year</HI> 1640. namely <HI>that the Oath of Supremacy was intended to bind only in opposition to Popery,</HI> occasion was thereby given to the <HI>Fathers</HI> of our <HI>Church</HI> to procure the last <HI>Authentick</HI> Interpretation of the <HI>Assertory</HI> part of the <HI>Oath</HI> in the <HI>Ca|nons</HI> of 1640. and cautioning us there in the first <HI>Canon</HI> against any <HI>Inde|pendent Coactive Power whether <HI>Papal or Popular.</HI></HI> But after our view of the orderly and necessary placing of all these polish'd and strong <HI>Pillars</HI> of <HI>Interpretation</HI> erected between the time of <HI>Primo Elizabethoe</HI> and the <HI>year</HI> 1640, and after Providence so ordering it at last, that the <HI>Consciences</HI> of the <HI>Loyal</HI> who were then reserv'd as <HI>Lyons</HI> to guard the <HI>Throne,</HI> had then a clear <HI>Oath</HI> to guard their Loyalty, and after their having then cause to say <HI>Tantoe molis erat</HI> to render the Oath both acceptable to Conscience and adequate to its first reasonable intention, the Land was punish'd with a dreadful <HI>Rebellion,</HI> and the <HI>sacred</HI> Obligations of the <HI>Oath</HI> and all its <HI>Inter|pretations</HI> could no more quench the raging Flames of the <HI>Civil</HI> War then the sprinkling of a little Holy Water could save a Town on fire.</P>
<P>You may therefore here again more particularly take it into your thoughts, that there is somewhat beside or beyond <HI>Oaths</HI> necessary to in|cline Heaven to Preserve States and Kingdoms and Ecclesiastical Polities therein, namely the trusting in God, and offering to him what the 51. <HI>Psalm</HI> calls <HI>the Sacrifices of God;</HI> and without which the thought of the <HI>tantoe molis</HI> and the endeavour'd piling <HI>Interpretation</HI> upon <HI>Interpretation,</HI> or Oath upon Oath as high as Heaven, and thereby designing to keep men together embody'd and united in the external Profession of any State|Religion, will prove as insignificant as did the old <HI>Politicks</HI> I shall refer you to in the <HI>Sacred</HI> Story, and when <HI>the whole Earth was of one Language, and of one Speech,</HI> and the <HI>Vogue</HI> was, <HI>Let us build a City and Tower whose top may reach to Heaven, and let us make us a Name, least we be scatter'd abroad on the face of the whole Earth.</HI> But Heaven confounded their <HI>Lan|guage,</HI> and their City was call'd <HI>Babel,</HI> and their feared Dissipation was their Punishment. They were so diffident of the Divine Promise whose <HI>garranty</HI> they had, that they were resolv'd by their own hands to provide against all Dangers of a future <HI>Deluge,</HI> and having built their <HI>Tower</HI> with <HI>Brick,</HI> they thought 'twould defend them from the Power of <HI>Fire,</HI> concerning which they had heard the <HI>Tradition</HI> that a general Destruction of the World should proceed from the fury of that <HI>Element;</HI> and they vainly endeavour'd to secure themselves against the anger of Heaven rather by a lofty Pile, then by lowly Minds.</P>

You know I mean Bishop <HI>Sanderson,</HI> who there shews, that <HI>tho Popes Usurpations or arrogating to themselves the Supreme Iurisdiction in</HI> spiritualibus <HI>throughout this Kingdom, was the Cause of the Oath of Suprema|cy, yet the Oath is obligatory according to the express words in the Utmost Latitude: the reason is, that the intention of a Law is general to provide against all future inconveniences of the like kind, or nature.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover the words in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s <HI>Admonition</HI> referring to <HI>the Persons call'd to Ecclesiastical Ministry in the Church,</HI> as the doubters, and the tenour of all the subsequent <HI>Interpretations</HI> as speaking them <HI>principally</HI> occasion'd by the doubters in the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> do further shew the Vanity of that Objection.</P>
<P>And if you will more particularly think of the <HI>Queen</HI>'s Authentick <HI>In|terpretation</HI> of that <HI>Oath</HI> and <HI>approved</HI> in <HI>Parliament,</HI> you will find the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Supremacy</HI> to be an <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Allegiance,</HI> and that it may be so-likewise <HI>properly</HI> termed. For in the beginning of the <HI>Admonition</HI> you will <HI>thus</HI> find it, <HI>viz. <HI>The Queen's Majesty being inform'd that in certain places of this Realm, sundry of her native Subjects being call'd to Ministry in the Church, be by sinister Perswasion and perverse Construction, in|duced to find some scruple in the form of an Oath, which by an Act of the last Parliament is prescribed to be required of divers Persons for the recognition of their ALLEGIANCE to her Majesty,</HI></HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P>As one may perceive by what the Queen's <HI>Interpretation</HI> in the <HI>Ad|monition</HI> refers to, that there was a great <HI>ferment</HI> in the Kingdom about the <HI>sense</HI> of the <HI>Oath,</HI> so suitably to what you mention'd of the <HI>Prudence</HI> of our <HI>Ancestors</HI> that caus'd various <HI>ferments</HI> to <HI>go off</HI> so <HI>insensibly,</HI> the next <HI>Par|liament</HI> in <HI>approving</HI> her <HI>Interpretation</HI> without troubling themselves to que|stion the <HI>Authentickness</HI> of it, doth corroborate your observation of the Excellence of the <HI>English</HI> understandings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>It doth so. The <HI>fermentation</HI> in the minds of the People you speak of had been <HI>Epidemical.</HI> And tho one might fancy by the <HI>Proem</HI> of the <HI>Admonition</HI> that the <HI>Interpretation</HI> as well as the <HI>Dispensing</HI> with Disability had an eye but on an inconsiderable number of People there referr'd to in the foremention'd words of <HI>sundry of her Majesty's Native Subjects in cer|tain places of this Realm,</HI> &amp;c. yet any one who knoweth the <HI>History</HI> of those times will find the <HI>Interpretation</HI> and <HI>Dispensation</HI> (as I may say) <HI>Calculated</HI> for the <HI>Meridian</HI> of all <HI>England,</HI> and the <HI>Interpretation</HI> having an eye on all <HI>Christendom.</HI></P>
<P>There was then in the <HI>Morning</HI> of that <HI>Queen</HI>'s Reign, and of the restora|tion of the Reform'd Religion, such a thick <HI>mist</HI> of causeless <HI>Fears</HI> and <HI>Iealousies</HI> that had generally o'erspread the minds of <HI>Protestants</HI> and <HI>Papists</HI> shortly after the Birth of the Statute of 1^o <HI>Eliz.</HI> c. 1^o. that nothing but the <HI>Supremacy</HI> both of <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Reason</HI> that shone in her authentick <HI>Interpre|tation</HI> of that <HI>Statute</HI> could disperse, and that too not suddenly. For as Mr. <HI>Nye</HI> in his Book of <HI>Two Acts of Parliament,</HI> or <HI>Observations on that Oath,</HI> tells us, <HI>It is mention'd in the Admonition that the Queen's Ecclesiastical Power is the same that was challenged and used, by</HI> Henry <HI>the</HI> 8th, <HI>&amp;c. which is supposed by some to be the same that was in the Pope, the Person only and</HI>
<PB N="115" REF="61">
<HI>not the Power changed: so that our Princes are but secular Popes. This Obje|ction was strengthen'd by the subtlety of</HI> Gardiner <HI>abroad: and at home by a Sermon Preach'd at</HI> Paul's Cross <HI>in the year</HI> 1588. <HI>by Dr.</HI> Bancroft, <HI>who calls Q.</HI> Eliz. <HI>a Petty Pope, and tells us her Ecclesiastical Authority is the same which the Pope's was formerly:</HI> and in the Margin opposite to what he had said of the subtlety of <HI>Gardiner, strengthening the Objection abroad,</HI> hath these words, viz. <HI>Whom</HI> Calvin <HI>terms Imposterille.</HI> And Mr. <HI>Nye</HI> after|ward goes on to shew how the 37th <HI>Article</HI> did remove the Objection suf|ficiently.</P>
<P>The <HI>Author</HI> of <HI>The true Grounds of Ecclesiastical Regiment,</HI> Printed in <HI>London,</HI> A. 1641. doth in <HI>p.</HI> 53. mention some mens objecting it against the Ecclesiastical <HI>Supremacy</HI> of our Monarchs, <HI>that it may descend to Infants un|der Age, as it did to King</HI> Edward <HI>the 6th, or to Women as to Queen</HI> Mary <HI>and Queen</HI> Elizabeth, <HI>and that whatsoever we may allow to men, such as</HI> Hen|ry <HI>the 8th; yet it seems unreasonable to allow it Women and Children. The Papists think this Objection of great moment, and therefore</HI> Bellarmine <HI>in great disdain casts it out, that in</HI> England <HI>they had a certain Woman for their Bishop; meaning Queen</HI> Elizabeth: <HI>and she knowing what an odium that word would draw on her both among Papists and many Protestants also, Consults her Bishops about it, and by their advice sets forth a Declaration, certifying the World thereby, that she claim'd no other Headship in the Church, but such as might exclude all dependency on foreign Headships, and secure her from all danger of being deposed,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>The Bishops in this did as warily pro|vide for their own Claim as the Queen's.</HI> And the Roman-Catholick <HI>Author</HI> of the <HI>Advocate for Conscience Liberty,</HI> discoursing of the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Supremacy</HI> in <HI>p.</HI> 181. <HI>&amp; seq.</HI> saith, <HI>That</HI> Luther, Calvin, Knox, Gilby <HI>disliked it:</HI> and mentions <HI>that a Iurisdiction purely spiritual was communicated to</HI> H. <HI>the 8th by his Supremacy, and assumed by him, and that he wanted his Spiritual By|title of Supremacy to justifie his Divorce, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">d his taking the Church Revenue into his hands: and that the Protectorship in</HI> E <HI>the 6th's time by virtue of the Oath of Supremacy continued to make new Church-Laws, Institutions,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and that Queen</HI> Elizabeth <HI>reassumed this Iurisdiction, having a greater neces|sity for it then her Brother, because her Marriage was declared null by the Pope.</HI> So then the state of <HI>Protestancy</HI> abroad and at home call'd on the <HI>Queen</HI> to <HI>distribute</HI> or <HI>dispense</HI> her <HI>Supreme</HI> Power in her <HI>Law</HI> by her <HI>Inter|pretation</HI> making a <HI>change</HI> not <HI>of</HI> it, but <HI>in</HI> the body of it: and which had it been <HI>changed</HI> by a <HI>repeal</HI> in <HI>Parliament</HI> for another, would have seem'd to blemish her figure of <HI>semper Eadem,</HI> and have reflected on the Under|standings and Consciences of those who had before took the Oath.</P>
<P>There was then in that Conjuncture an universal <HI>outcry</HI> of <HI>Conscience</HI> that <HI>Sin lies at the door,</HI> a thing worse then <HI>Hannibal ad Portas;</HI> a burthen that hath caus'd all the <HI>Groans of the Creation</HI> that ever happen'd. And where there is <HI>Periculum animae</HI> there is always <HI>Periculum in mor&acirc;,</HI> and which the Queen's authentick <HI>Interpretation</HI> did remove, and which was <HI>approved</HI> by the next Parliament: and no <HI>noise</HI> made or <HI>complaining</HI> heard <HI>in our streets</HI> about any seeming <HI>Alteration</HI> made in the <HI>Law</HI> or <HI>Oath</HI> it self, by the Prerogative of interpretation or acquittal from the disabling Punish|ments then exercised. And it is but congruous to <HI>humane</HI> Nature and com|mon Policy in men when they see any thing not ill in it self done that hath eminently conduced to make the World <HI>easie,</HI> not to <HI>embarass</HI> such thing with litigious scruples about the <HI>fieri non debuit,</HI> nor to adventure to trou|ble the World again when it is inclined to and resolv'd upon its rest. Some thoughts of this Nature probably inclined my Lord <HI>Coke</HI> to shew the Com|plaisance he did, not only to King <HI>Iames</HI> his <HI>incapacitating</HI> Canon about
<PB N="116" REF="62">
the <HI>double</HI> Subscription, but as to the <HI>Oath</HI> against <HI>Simony</HI> &amp; that of <HI>Canonical</HI> obedience, and which inclined Judge <HI>Croke</HI> to be pleas'd with the <HI>Canons</HI> of 1640. tho containing the <HI>Oath</HI> with an <HI>Et caetera,</HI> and which made the <HI>Iudges</HI> so apt to over-rule some of Sir <HI>E. Coke</HI>'s Exceptions to the <HI>Sheriffs</HI> Oath, as I have mention'd.</P>
<P>You may indeed find that some among the <HI>Puritans</HI> in some Conjun|ctures in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s time, did presume to reproach the Government of the <HI>Church</HI> with her having <HI>dispens'd</HI> with the <HI>disability</HI> of some Persons incurr'd by <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament.</HI> The <HI>Author</HI> of the <HI>famous</HI> Book publish'd in her Reign, call'd, <HI>An Abstract of certain Acts of Parliament,</HI> hath in the <HI>Conclusion</HI> these two factious <HI>Queries,</HI> viz. <HI>Whether a mere Lay-man, no Do|ctor of the Civil Law, may be a Bishop's Chancellor, and so may Excommuni|cate? Whether a mere Lay-man no Doctor of the Civil Law, may be a Bishop's Register, contrary to an Act of Parliament?</HI> The <HI>Author</HI> intendeth there to referr to the <HI>Statute</HI> of 37^o. <HI>H.</HI> 8. c. 17. and as he had before expresly done in <HI>p.</HI> 196. <HI>&amp; Seq.</HI> and of which <HI>Statute</HI> we have so much discours'd; and he in <HI>p.</HI> 201. instanceth in <HI>many Lay-men who were not Doctors of the Civil Law, and yet then exercised Ecclesiastical Iurisdiction.</HI> He had too in <HI>p.</HI> 196. took notice that as that <HI>Statute establish'd and confirm'd to the King and his Successors, and so unto our most Gracious Soveraign the Queen's Majesty that now is, lawful Preheminence, Power, Superiority and Lordship over all Persons within her Dominions of what state or Condition soever, touching Punishments for any Heresies, Errors, Vices, Schisms, Abuses, Ido|latries, Hypocrisies and Superstitions springing or growing by means of any her disobedient and disloyal Subjects; so hath her Majesty by her Injunctions pub|lish'd, that her Highness did never pretend any Title or challenge any Au|thority to punish any of her Subjects for any of the said Offences by Censure Ecclesiastical in right belonging to her Royal Person; but that her Highness meaning and intent is and always hath been to commit the execution thereof always to the Ecclesiastical State of her time:</HI> and he then sets down her <HI>In|terpretation</HI> in the <HI>Admonition.</HI></P>
<P>But had that <HI>Author</HI> consider'd how it was <HI>declared</HI> by that <HI>Statute,</HI> that <HI>by Holy Scripture all Authority and Power is given to His Majesty, and all such Persons as His Majesty shall appoint to hear and deter|mine all manner of Causes Ecclesiastical, and to correct Uice and Sin whatsoever;</HI> and that this <HI>Statute</HI> was <HI>revived</HI> by the <HI>1st</HI> of <HI>Eliz.</HI> he would not have wonder'd at the <HI>Queen's</HI> allowing that <HI>Statute</HI> to be <HI>dispens'd</HI> with as it was. Nor would any one therefore wonder at the Royal Martyr in the 12th and 13th <HI>Canons</HI> of <HI>A.</HI> 1640. <HI>Condescending</HI> to humour the Com|plaints of the <HI>Puritans</HI> by an equal <HI>Interpretation</HI> of that <HI>Statute</HI> of 37^o <HI>H.</HI> 8. and by <HI>dispensing</HI> with it as he did; and that so far as to the disabling <HI>Lay|Chancellors</HI> to proceed in such <HI>Censures</HI> as they were <HI>enabled</HI> by that <HI>Sta|tute</HI> to do.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Bagshaw</HI> in his first <HI>Argument</HI> in <HI>Parliament</HI> concerning the <HI>Canons</HI> thus reflects on the <HI>Clergy</HI> for those <HI>two</HI> Canons, <HI>viz. Concerning the 12th and 13th Canons touching the freeing and discharging of Chancellors and Offi|cials from executing any Excommunication in their own Person, or any Cen|sure against the Clergy, because they are Lay-men; I say, that in doing and enacting this they have done quite contrary to an Act of Parliament still in force, in taking from them this Power of exercising the Censures of the Church which that Statute gives them: which I did look when some Ci|vilians now in the House should have maintain'd. And altho it were to be wish'd that only Clergymen should have this Power of Excommunication, and other Censures of the Church; yet seeing an Act of Parliament hath</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="62">
<HI>given this Power to Lay-men, it is high Presumption to make Canons against it.</HI></P>
<P>But he well knew that after the <HI>stamp</HI> of the <HI>Royal</HI> Authority put on these <HI>Canons</HI> as well as <HI>before,</HI> Lay-men in the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Delegates</HI> did Ex|communicate, and as they did in the <HI>high</HI> Commission. And you may ob|serve it, that in the <HI>Commission</HI> granted <HI>Primo Elizabethae</HI> to her <HI>Commissio|ners</HI> pursuant to the <HI>Statute</HI> of that year, there were but <HI>two</HI> Clergy-men (and those <HI>Bishops</HI>) and 17 <HI>Lay-men.</HI></P>
<P>My Lord&punc; <HI>Coke,</HI> Inst. 4. c. 74. writing of the <HI>High Commission</HI> in Causes <HI>Ecclesiastical,</HI> saith, <HI>There is no question but the Commissioners for such Cau|ses as are committed to them by force of this Act, may, if the Commissioners be Competent, proceed to deprivation of the Popish Clergy which was the main object of the Act, or to punish them by Ecclesiastical Censures,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And with|out question if the Commissioners be COMPETENT, that is, if they be spi|ritual men, they may proceed to Sentence of Excommunication, which may right well be Certify'd as well as Excommunication before Commissioners Dele|gates: both of these Authorities being under the Great Seal,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And Ex|communication certify'd ly Commissioners Del gates hath been allowed as it appeareth in</HI> 23. Eliz. Dyer. 371. <HI>And in many Cases Acts of Parliament have adjudged men Excommunicate</HI> ipso facto. <HI>But if they be meer Lay-men, the fault is not in the Statute or in the Law, but in the Nomination: and upon Certificate made of the Excommunication according to Law, a</HI> Significavit, <HI>or</HI> Cap. Excom. <HI>shall be awarded out of the Chancery, for the taking and impri|soning the Bodies of such Excommunicate Persons.</HI> But had his Lordship (as I said in the Case of the other <HI>Author</HI>) consider'd how by the <HI>Statute</HI> of 37. <HI>H.</HI> 8. it was <HI>declared that by Holy Scripture all Authority and Power is given to His Majesty, and to all such Persons as he shall ap|point to hear and determine all manner of Causes Ecclesiastical, and to correct Uice and Sin whatsoever,</HI> he would not (I believe) have thought Lay-men <HI>incompetent</HI> or incapable Persons so to have acted in the <HI>high Commission,</HI> or <HI>Delegacy,</HI> or have said <HI>there was any fault in the Nomination of Lay-men.</HI></P>
<P>And yet you see my Lord <HI>Coke</HI> shews you how the <HI>Government</HI> then ac|quiesced in such <HI>Nomination;</HI> and <HI>assisted</HI> the <HI>execution</HI> of the <HI>Sentences</HI> given by such as he thought <HI>incompetent.</HI></P>
<P>Nor are we therefore to wonder at what Mr. <HI>Bagshaw</HI> mentions of <HI>the Civilians in the House of Commons not objecting that the King had done con|trary to an Act of Parliament in taking from Bishops, Chancellors and Offi|cials the Power of exercising Church Censures given them by the Act:</HI> and which by the Power <HI>declared</HI> in that <HI>Act</HI> to be given him by <HI>Holy Scrip|tures,</HI> he might have either continued to them, or abridged or taken away the exercise thereof from them, if he had pleas'd. And considering that the <HI>Lex Scandali</HI> doth equally <HI>oblige</HI> Kings as well as Subjects in <HI>Point</HI> of <HI>Conscience,</HI> it is not to be wonder'd that that <HI>Tender-conscienced</HI> King did in that Conjuncture think himself obliged so equitably to make his <HI>Inter|pretation</HI> of that <HI>Statute</HI> as in complaisance with some of his Subjects who had <HI>took</HI> offence at <HI>Lay-Chancellors</HI> Power of Excommunicating, to disable them to it.</P>
<P>I told you before how that Pious Prince did in complaisance with the <HI>Fathers</HI> of our <HI>Church</HI> think himself obliged to exercise his <HI>Regal</HI> Power of interpreting or <HI>declaring,</HI> and when in <HI>A.</HI> 1637. he issued out his <HI>Procla|mation Declaring that the Bishops holding their Courts and issuing Process in their own Names were not against the Laws of the Realm,</HI> and that the <HI>Iudges</HI> resolutions were notify'd therein to that purpose, and that the <HI>fer|ment</HI>
<PB N="118" REF="63">
about that Point was setled, and the Bishops <HI>issuing</HI> out their <HI>Pro|cesses,</HI> was setled too; the which <HI>Proclamation</HI> too you will find Mr. <HI>Bag|shaw</HI> mentions in his <HI>second Argument,</HI> where <HI>p.</HI> 40. he tells you of <HI>the Bi|shop's having procured a Proclamation,</HI> A. 1637. <HI>declaring the Opinions of the Iudges, that the Statute of</HI> 1^o Edw. 6. c. 2. <HI>is repeal'd and of no force at this day,</HI> and <HI>that Bishops may keep Courts in their own Names.</HI> And I shall now tell you, that as in the <HI>year</HI> 1637. the <HI>Bishops</HI> were in so <HI>full</HI> and <HI>peaceable</HI> possession of their Privilege of <HI>issuing</HI> out of their <HI>Processes</HI> in their <HI>own</HI> names, by means of what His <HI>Majesty</HI> had <HI>declared</HI> pursuant to the <HI>Resolutions</HI> unanimously given by all the <HI>Iudges</HI> and the <HI>Barons</HI> of the <HI>Ex|chequer</HI> (and of which Sir <HI>E. Coke</HI> saith, <HI>Inst.</HI> 2. <HI>that they are for Matters of Law of highest Authority next to the Court of Parliament)</HI> so by <HI>Iudgment</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> the <HI>settlement</HI> of that Controversie by virtue of His Majesty's <HI>Declarative</HI> Power so exercised, was afterward <HI>approved.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a thing I would gladly hear of; for one would think that the exercise of the Regal Power of <HI>Declaring</HI> or <HI>Interpreting</HI> what relates to an <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> might occasionally heighten a <HI>ferment</HI> in stead of abating it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will find little or no cause if you consult our ancient <HI>English</HI> Story (and there see how the mutual <HI>Confidence</HI> between King and People hath in several Ages supported the Government) to fancy that <HI>Declaratory</HI> Proclamations relating to <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> did make any ferment. The <HI>Interpretation</HI> of the <HI>Statutes</HI> hath in all <HI>Causes</HI> between Party and Party, and wherein <HI>meum</HI> and <HI>tuum</HI> and <HI>Property</HI> are concern'd, been by ancient usage under our Kings still left to the <HI>Iudges:</HI> and the <HI>Proclamations</HI> of our Princes on great <HI>emergent</HI> occasions in the State <HI>declaring</HI> or <HI>interpre|ting</HI> their Laws pursuant to the <HI>Supreme</HI> Power committed to them by God for the good of their People, hath still been observ'd to tend both to the good of the <HI>People</HI> and the <HI>Laws</HI> too. If you will look on all the De|claratory <HI>Proclamations</HI> in the Reigns of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and King <HI>Iames,</HI> of which you have a <HI>Collection,</HI> you will (I believe) find none but what were acceptable among all their Loyal Subjects.</P>
<P>But as to this Declaratory <HI>Proclamation</HI> of King <HI>Charles</HI> the First before|mention'd, you will find it (as I told you) <HI>approved</HI> in Parliament. And if you will please to consult in your <HI>Statute-Book</HI> the <HI>Act</HI> of 13^o <HI>Car.</HI> 2. c. 12. of which the <HI>title</HI> is <HI>Explanation of a Clause contain'd in an Act of Par|liament made in the 17th year of the late King</HI> Charles, <HI>Entituled an Act for repeal of a branch of a Statute</HI> 1^o Elizabethae, <HI>Concerning Commissioners for Causes Ecclesiastical,</HI> you will there find that this <HI>Act</HI> of the late King's <HI>loyal</HI> long <HI>Parliament,</HI> viz. 13^o <HI>Car.</HI> 2. hath in it three <HI>Proviso's.</HI> The <HI>first</HI> is concerning the <HI>High Commission-Court:</HI> the <HI>second <HI>Proviso</HI></HI> is concerning the taking away the Oath <HI>ex officio.</HI> And the <HI>third <HI>Proviso</HI></HI> is, to limit and confine the Power of Ecclesiastical Judges in all their Proceedings to <HI>what WAS and by Law might be used before the <HI>year</HI></HI> 1639, which plainly includes, allows and <HI>approves</HI> King <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>First</HI>'s <HI>Proclamation</HI> in the <HI>year</HI> 1637.</P>
<P>In the time of a former disloyal long Parliament, the <HI>Regal</HI> Power of <HI>Interpreting</HI> or <HI>declaring</HI> was by them represented as a <HI>Gravamen,</HI> and while yet they <HI>usurp'd</HI> that Power themselves. If you will look on the <HI>Declara|tion of the Lords and Commons, in</HI> Husband's <HI>Collections,</HI> p. 686. you will there find they say, <HI>It is high time for the whole Kingdom now to understand that His Majesty's Authority is more in his Courts without his Person then in his Person without his Courts, when the Power of DECLARING Law shall be deny'd to the whole Court of Parliament in particular Causes before them,</HI>
<PB N="119" REF="63">
(<HI>for we have claim'd it, we have exercised it no otherwise to be obligatory as a judicial Declaration of the Law) and shall be attributed to His Majesty to do it in general by his Proclamation without relation to a particular Case, and making his Interpretation of the Law to be a rule in all Cases, as in divers late Proclamations he hath done.</HI> And if you will look on <HI>His Majesty's Answer to the Declaration of b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">th Houses of Parliament of</HI> July 1. 1642. you will find there very many Profound Observations and Presidents, and Au|thorities of Law, and wherein he several times refers to <HI>the happy times of that good Queen</HI> Elizabeth, as well as to ancient Times, and he thence taking his measures, saith in <HI>p.</HI> 15. <HI>The King caus'd Proclama|tions to be made; for in such Cases Proclamations declaratory were not conceiv'd in those times to be illegal&punc;</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And you may easily imagine this Power of authentick <HI>Interpretation</HI> ve|ry well Consistent with the just Power of the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Lords</HI> in declaring the Law in a <HI>particular</HI> Case: of which I occasionally mention'd to you the late <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Anglesy</HI>'s opinion. But how not only the <HI>Lords,</HI> but the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Commons</HI> did often during the late Rebellion encroach on the Regal Power of <HI>declaring,</HI> and by Ordinances without and against the King's consent, I shall some other time shew you at large.</P>

<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: and I can refer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ou for the <HI>fact</HI> of it to <HI>The Declaration of King</HI> Charles <HI>the First, of</HI> August 12. 1642. <HI>to all his l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ving Subjects;</HI> and who there mention<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">&punc; <HI>That after several in imations of Treasons, PLOTS, and Conspiracies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> the Papists, of great Provisions of Arms by them, and training Men under-ground, and many other false Reports created, spread and countenanced by themselves upon some general Apprehensions of Designs against them, a <HI>Protestation</HI> is made in the House of Commons for Union and Consent among themselves to perform those Duties which (if they had meant no more then they had express'd) had been sufficiently provided for by the Oaths they had already taken, and which their former Duties obliged them to. Here|upon a Protestation is framed, and being put into such words as no honest man could believe himself obliged by it to any unlawful Action, was voluntarily taken by all the Members of the House of Commons, and presently recom|mended to the House of Lords, where it receiv'd the same Countenance: that is was look'd upon as containing nothing in it self unlawful, tho some Mem|bers of that House refused to take it as being voluntary, and not imposed by any lawful Authority. Then 'tis recommended to the City of</HI> London, <HI>and over all the Kingdom by Order from the House of Commons (a strange and un|heard of Usurpation) to be taken by all Persons. But within very few days, upon Conference among themselves, and among those Clergymen who daily sol|licite their unlawful and unwarrantable Designs with the People, they find they were by this Protestation so far from having drawn People into their Combination, that in truth all men conceiv'd that they were even engaged by it against their main Design, by promising to defend the true Reform'd Protestant Religion express'd in the Doctrine of the Church of</HI> England:</P>
<P><HI>And thereupon some Persons of that Faction prevail'd, that after the Members of the Houses had taken it, a Declaration was set forth by the House of Commons, that by those words The Doctrine of the Church of England, was intended only so far as it was opposite to Popery, and Popish innovations, and that the words were not to be extended to the maintenance of the Discipline and Government,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and so under this Explication and Declaration publish'd only by the House of Commons, and never assented to by the House of Peers, this Protestation was di|rected</HI>
<PB N="120" REF="64" MS="y">
<HI>to be generally taken throughout</HI> England. <HI>And to that pur|pose a Bill is drawn, passed the House of Commons, and sent up to the House of Lords, who at the second Reading finding many particulars in it unfit to be so severely imposed upon the Subjects absolutely rejected.</HI></P>
<P>You see here again an <HI>Instance</HI> of the Prudence of the great <HI>Consiliarii Na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">i,</HI> His Majesty's <HI>great Councel,</HI> in not aiding the Faction against <HI>Prero|gative</HI> in that Point. For tho on the account of His Majesty's <HI>tacit</HI> Dispen|sation by way of <HI>Connivence</HI> presumed in that Conjuncture, many of the Loyal of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> did <HI>take</HI> that <HI>Protestation</HI> and concur in the recommendation (His Majesty not having <HI>Prohibited</HI> the <HI>taking</HI> of it, as he did a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">terward by a Proclamation forbid the <HI>taking</HI> of the <HI>Covenant</HI>) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">et when it was visible that such an <HI>Interpretation</HI> so encroaching on the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and on Prerogative, was design'd without and against His Majesty's Approbation to be imposed on the People; it is not to be won|der'd that the <HI>Lords</HI> (as things then were) rejected a <HI>Bill</HI> of that Nature.</P>
<P>But it follows then in His Majesty's <HI>Declaration, <HI>Yet of this we took no notice, but pressed still the Disbanding of the Armies,</HI></HI> &amp;c. so that the <HI>ferment</HI> about the <HI>Protestation,</HI> and the trouble it gave the Kingdom by the <HI>Super-induced</HI> Interpretation, were in a short time over.</P>

<P>You having from the occasion given you by Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Power of <HI>interpreting,</HI> and by her <HI>dispensing</HI> with disability in all who took the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Supremacy</HI> according to the sense notify'd in <HI>The Admonition,</HI> re|ferr'd my thoughts often to the <HI>Regal</HI> Power of interpreting, and having in the beginning of our Discourse this meeting, left it to me t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> consider how much <HI>the Power of Dispensing with any Law may be thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">o-incident with interpreting,</HI> and promised me that you would some other time shew me at large that <HI>the Dispensing with Laws is in effect the equitable interpreting that in such and such Cases and Circumstances they were not intended and ought not to bind, but ought to be relax'd,</HI> I shall be glad if before we part, you would do it.</P>

<P>I had rather do it at our next meeting.

And he there in <HI>l.</HI> 3. <HI>c.</HI> 6. particularly tells us, that <HI>the Interpretation of Laws made by Iudges, is matter of Fidelity, and nothing of Empire and Power: and it is a good pro|bable warranty of Conscience, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ut no final Determination in case any doubt happen to oppose it. No man is to ask favour of the Iudge, but of the Prince he may.</HI> And he had before said, <HI>That when the Power that made the Law doth interpret it, the Interpretation is authentical and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">bligeth Conscience as much as the Law, and can release the Bond of Conscience as far forth as the Interpretation extends, as if the Law were abrogated, and that whether it be by declaring the meaning of the Law, or by abating the rigour, or by dis|pensing in the Case, or enlarging the Favour, or restraining the Severity, it is all one as to the event of the Obligation of Conscience.</HI></P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>He had an excellent <HI>Metaphysical</HI> head: and his <HI>Method</HI> of writing in that Chapter, <HI>Of the Several ways of the changing of Humane Laws,</HI> was <HI>partly</HI> after the Example of <HI>Suarez</HI> in his Book <HI>De Legibus,</HI> and who was a voluminous Writer of <HI>Metaphysicks,</HI> and writing of any Subject could not <HI>recedere ab arte su&acirc;</HI> in that Learning that is so in|finitely prolifick of <HI>Artificial</HI> distinctions without <HI>Natural</HI> differences.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="64">I mention'd the <HI>Bishop</HI>'s but <HI>PARTLY writing</HI> after the way of <HI>Suarez;</HI> for he was far from crumbling the <HI>weightier</HI> Points of the <HI>Law</HI> into the <HI>Minutiae</HI> of <HI>Metaphysicks</HI> as the other did; and he in his excellent <HI>Preface</HI> doth very passionately complain of <HI>Moral</HI> Theology, having been made an <HI>Art</HI> of the <HI>Schools,</HI> and that <HI>what God had made plain, Men have intrica|ted;</HI> and for that purpose saith, <HI>There is a Rule among the Lawyers, which very much relates to the Conscience of those Men who are engaged in Suits and Sentences of Law in all Countrys which are ruled by the Civil Law,</HI> in quolibet Actu requiritur Citatio: <HI>of this Rule</HI> Porcius <HI>brings an hundred and sixteen</HI> Ampliations, <HI>and an hundred and twenty four</HI> Limitations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And thus <HI>Suarez</HI> in his 6th Book <HI>De Legibus,</HI> (and the <HI>Title</HI> of which <HI>Book</HI> is, <HI>The Interpretation, Cessation and change of Humane Laws</HI>) hath there Twenty seven <HI>Chapters</HI> concerning the same: and where his <HI>first</HI> Chapter is, <HI>Of the way of rightly Interpreting an Humane Law:</HI> his 2d, <HI>Of the Extension in them by Interpretation of them:</HI> and his <HI>3d, Of the Extension to a Case not Comprehended:</HI> his 4th, <HI>Doubts of the Extension of Laws:</HI> his 5th, <HI>Of the Restriction by Interpretation:</HI> his 6th, <HI>Of the Ceasing of the Obligation of a Law in particular Contrary to its words:</HI> his 7th, <HI>Of the Excusing of a Law by Equity:</HI> his 8th, <HI>Of the Use of Equity without recourse to the Prince:</HI> his 9th, <HI>Of the Ceasing of a Law upon its Cause ceasing:</HI> his 10th, <HI>Of Dispen|sation in an Humane Law:</HI> his 11th, <HI>Of the Effects of Dispensation:</HI> his 12th, <HI>Of the Material Cause of Dispensation:</HI> his 13th, <HI>Of the form of Dis|pensation;</HI> and so on in the others with much <HI>Metaphysical</HI> subtlety.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Bishop</HI> in his before-mention'd Third <HI>Book</HI> and 6th <HI>Chapter,</HI> viz. <HI>Of the Interpretation, Diminution and Abrogation of Humane Laws,</HI> brings in but <HI>seven</HI> ways of the <HI>changing</HI> of <HI>humane</HI> Laws, so that the <HI>Obligation</HI> of <HI>Conscience</HI> is also <HI>changed;</HI> whereof his <HI>first</HI> is by <HI>Equity.</HI> His <HI>second</HI> is by <HI>Interpretation.</HI> His <HI>third,</HI> by a <HI>Contrary, or a ceasing reason.</HI> And his <HI>fourth</HI> by <HI>Dispensation,</HI> &amp;c. and of which <HI>latter</HI> he saith, <HI>If we use the word improperly, Dispensation can signifie a Declaration made by the Superior that the Subject in certain Cases is not obliged, that the Law-giver did not intend it,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>but when Dispensation signifies Properly, it means an Act of mere Grace and Favour proceeding from an extrinsick Cause; that is, not the Nature of the thing, or the merit of the Cause, but either the merit of the Person, or some degrees of reasonableness in the thing, which not being of it self enough to pro|cure the favour of the Law, is of it self enough to make a man capable of the Favour of the Prince,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But as here in this <HI>nice</HI> distinction, he is enforced to make him who doth <HI>dispensare</HI> to do that which the <HI>Canonists</HI> make the <HI>ratio nominis</HI> of it, name|ly <HI>diversa pensare,</HI> and in the Scales of <HI>Equity</HI> to <HI>weigh</HI> and <HI>interpret</HI> the degrees of the reasonableness of the thing, so in his handling of the <HI>Prince</HI>'s Power of <HI>interpreting,</HI> he makes <HI>Equity</HI> Co-incident with it, and refers to the Law in the Code, viz. <HI>Inter aequitatem jus&abque; interpositam interpretatio|nem nobis solis &amp; oportet &amp; licet inspicere:</HI> and his instances of that <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>Interpretation</HI> are referr'd to the <HI>favours</HI> shew'd by it to <HI>Persons,</HI> and par|ticularly to <HI>Solomon</HI>'s <HI>absolving</HI> Abiathar <HI>from the Sentence of Death, because he had formerly done worthily to the Interests of his Father</HI> David. And then saith, <HI>Now this Power tho it may be done by Interpretation, yet when it is ad|ministred by the Prince, it is most commonly by way of Pardon, absolute Power and Prerogative. When a Law determines that under such an Age a Person shall be UNCAPABLE of being the General of an Army, the Supreme Power can declare the meaning of the Law to be, unless a great excellency of Cou|rage and maturity of Iudgment supply the want of years: in which very Case,</HI> Scipio Africanus <HI>said wisely, when he desir'd to be employ'd in the</HI> Punick
<PB N="122" REF="65">
<HI>War,</HI> Se sat annorum habiturum si populus Romanus voluerit. <HI>Thus</HI> Tibe|rius <HI>put</HI> Nero <HI>into the Senate at Fifteen years of Age, and so did</HI> Augustus <HI>the like to</HI> Tiberius <HI>and his Brother: and the People declar'd or dispens'd with the Law in</HI> Pompey'<HI>s Case, and allow'd him a triumph before he had been</HI> Consul <HI>or</HI> Praetor. And he had before said, <HI>When the Law-giver interprets his Law, he doth not take off the Obligation of his Law,</HI> (i. e. meaning the Obligation of his Law in general) <HI>but declares that in such a Case it was not intended to oblige.</HI> Tacitus <HI>tells of a Roman Knight, who having sworn to his Wife that he would never be divorced from her, was by</HI> Tiberius <HI>dis|pens'd with, when he had taken her in the unchaste Embraces of his Son-in-Law. The Emperor then declared, that the Knight had only obliged himself not to be divorced, unless a great Cause should intervene.</HI></P>
<P>And thus <HI>Suarez</HI> himself in his said 10th Chapter, <HI>De Dispensatione in lege human&acirc;</HI> makes <HI>Dispensation</HI> apply'd to signifie an act <HI>quo quis ab obliga|tione legis eximitur,</HI> and saith, <HI>quia unus modus esse potest per Interpreta|tionem, ideo potuit etiam in e&acirc; significatione usurpari: tamen in hac etiam significatione sumpta, non quamcunque interpretationem legis, sed illam solam quae in casu dubio, &amp; per potestatem superioris datur ad liberandum subditum ab obligatione legis significat: quia haec tantum est Actus administrationis &amp; potestatis ADEO Commissae. Et illa tantum tollit aliquo modo onus legis, quod sine tali potestate auferri non posset:</HI> and so (saith he) 'tis agreed on by all that <HI>Dispensation</HI> is an <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Iurisdiction: but 'tis drawn into the Law to signifie the taking away the</HI> vinculum <HI>of the Law in particular Cases, and so we generally use it.</HI></P>

<P>But <HI>Metaphysicks</HI> apart. I shall not trouble my self about <HI>what is what,</HI> but <HI>what</HI> is my <HI>Duty</HI> by virtue of my <HI>Oath.</HI> And I observe, that what you cited out of the <HI>Bishop,</HI> viz. <HI>That when the Power that made the Law doth interpret, the Interpretation is authentical,</HI> &amp;c. may render him no fa|vourer of an <HI>Interpretation</HI> not made in <HI>Parliament</HI> by the Legislative Power.</P>

<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall sometime at our meeting again observe to you what the <HI>Bishop</HI> hath there asserted, <HI>l.</HI> 3. <HI>c.</HI> 3. that <HI>Kings have a Legislative Power in the Affairs of Religion and the Church,</HI> and where he saith, <HI>that the LEAST part of this Power is to permit the free exercise of it, and to remove all Im|pediments, and to give it Advantages of free Assemblies, and Competent maintenance, and Publick Encouragements,</HI> &amp;c. And shall then shew you what Power <HI>Circa Sacra</HI> the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> with great Prudence and Justice allow'd our <HI>Princes</HI> in the introducing the <HI>Reformation,</HI> (and which its Constitutions and <HI>Canons</HI> have since owned) and from the <HI>allowance</HI> of which <HI>Power,</HI> our great Church-men then knew there could be <HI>vestigia nulla retrorsum</HI> in the Case of a <HI>Prince</HI> of any other Religion coming to the Crown.</P>
<P>But I shall at present tell you that as to what I have mention'd to you out of <HI>Suarez</HI> and that <HI>Bishop,</HI> altho you need neither now nor at any time to charge your memory with the subtlety of Distinctions, and of the <HI>Pro|pri&egrave;</HI> and <HI>minus Propri&egrave;</HI> when you are in eager pursuit of the substance of things; you will find in both those Authors what is very substantial about the Doctrine of Dispensing: and what I have cited of their rendring <HI>Dis|pensing</HI> and <HI>Interpreting</HI> thus Co-incident is <HI>&agrave; propos,</HI> and may mind you of Princes being both empow'red and obliged in Justice in their administra|tion of the <HI>executive</HI> Power of their Laws to <HI>declare</HI> or <HI>interpret</HI> their Reli|gionary <HI>Penal</HI> Laws as dispensable in relation to particular times and Persons. And you may therefore here call to mind that passage in the <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Trent,</HI> viz. <HI>That on Fryar</HI> Adrian'<HI>s</HI> vociferating there about the Pope's <HI>dispensing</HI>
<PB N="123" REF="65">
being an Arbitrary favour, <HI>Verdune</HI> the famous <HI>French</HI> Divine took him down with saying, <HI>that it is a fond Perswasion that Dispensing is a mere favour: for it is as good distribute Iustice as what is most so. And the Priest sins if he giveth it not; for it is nothing else but a right Interpretation of Law.</HI> You may very well suppose that thoughts arising from those words in the <HI>Ordination</HI> of <HI>Bishops,</HI> viz. <HI>That you have your Authority not to destroy, but to save: not to hurt, but to help,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>to be so merciful, as not to be remiss: so to administer Discipline, as not to forget Mercy,</HI> &amp;c. have formerly inclined our <HI>Bishops</HI> in the Reigns of King <HI>Iames</HI> and King <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>First</HI> to think themselves obliged to interpret and declare the Laws about Church disci|pline as dispensable, and to <HI>dispense</HI> with them in the <HI>Cases</HI> of Mr. <HI>Hilder|sham</HI> and Mr. <HI>Dod,</HI> as I told you at our last meeting. And can you here see an <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> that thus s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">tleth the <HI>Ordination</HI> of <HI>Bishops,</HI> and which <HI>Act</HI> not only allows but requires them thus to <HI>Interpretari &amp; dispen|sare in lege,</HI> or in an <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament;</HI> and fancy it possible for the <HI>King</HI> (when as the <HI>Act</HI> of 37^o <HI>H.</HI> 8. tells you that <HI>Archbishops, Bishops, Arch|deacons and other Ecclesiastical Persons have no manner of Iurisdiction Ecclesiastical, but by, under, and from His Royal Majesty</HI>) not to be em|pow'red to exercise such Jurisdiction?</P>
<P>And I may here add, that when it is declared in the <HI>Statute</HI> of 1^o <HI>Eliz.</HI> c. 2. that <HI>the Queen's Majesty may orda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> such further Ceremonies and Rites as may be most for the advancement of God's Glory,</HI> &amp;c. will any one wonder at the Crowns relaxing the <HI>Penal</HI> Laws about <HI>Rites</HI> and <HI>Cere|monies</HI> in the Case of particular Persons; and as <HI>Edward</HI> the 6th (as is known) did in the Case of Bishop <HI>Hooper?</HI> And if you have a mind to see an <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament,</HI> that not only <HI>approves</HI> the Prince's remitting of his Penal Laws, but what applauds some excess in so doing, I can for that purpose direct you to the <HI>Act</HI> of 1^o <HI>Edw.</HI> 6. c. 12. in the beginning of which 'tis said, <HI>Nothing being more Godly, more sure, more to be wish'd and desired between a Prince the Supreme Head and Ruler, and the Sub|jects, whose Governor and Head he is, then on the Prince's part, great Clemency and Indulgency, and rather too much indulgency and remission of his Royal Power and just Punishment, then exact Severity and Iustice to be shew'd,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But as when we were near the end of our former Conference, you rightly observ'd that many perverse People would be <HI>crying out</HI> that <HI>any lawful Dispensing with the Laws establish'd,</HI> was <HI>Contradictio in adjecto,</HI> so I shall now observe to you that any who to the diminishing from a Prince's <HI>Cha|racter</HI> of being <HI>just,</HI> presume to insinuate it that a <HI>Prince</HI>'s valuing himself on that <HI>Character,</HI> and yet shewing <HI>mercy</HI> to some in releasing them from the <HI>Bonds</HI> and <HI>Penalties</HI> of some of his Laws, is a <HI>Contradiction,</HI> do appear to me great objects of Compassion in so erring. And for this I shall refer you to the <HI>Happy future State of</HI> England, where in <HI>p.</HI> 233. 'tis said that <HI>He who separates Mercy from Iustice, is unjust to the very name of Iustice, and robbeth it of the better half of its signification, leaving its teeth and claws, and taking away its heart and bowels.</HI> Jarchas <HI>the Indian, and Chief of the</HI> Brachmans <HI>in</HI> Philostratus <HI>is brought in finding fault with</HI> Apollonius Ty|aneus <HI>and others of the Greeks, for that they confined and apply'd the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> to those only who do no wrong to one another, and telling them that they were in an error, for saith he among the Chiefest Offices of Iustice <GAP DESC="foreign"> and <GAP DESC="foreign"> together with <GAP DESC="foreign"> ought to be reckon'd up.

<P><PB N="124" REF="66">And you will find Mr. <HI>Gregory</HI> there cited for relating it in his <HI>Opus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">.

<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say <HI>Amen</HI> to that <HI>Petition;</HI> and do at the same time pay my thanks to <HI>Heaven</HI> for that one doth <HI>bear rule</HI> over me, in whose great <HI>Genius Iustice</HI> and <HI>Mercy</HI> do appear to the World as the same thing: and whose <HI>Iustice</HI> when ever any one shall come to Paint in Story, he will not need to do it in the way of a <HI>half-face</HI> to hide any <HI>defect</HI> of <HI>Mercy:</HI> and wherein if any Prince be deficient, his <HI>Historian</HI> will be put to do it in the way I mention'd; and as <HI>Pliny</HI> tells us, <HI>Appelles</HI> drawing the Face of a King who had but one Eye, and intending to conceal that defect, was put upon the Painting him turning his Visage a little away, and so shewing but the one side of his Face: and from whence <HI>Pliny</HI> makes the <HI>Invention</HI> of that way of <HI>Painting</HI> to have come.</P>
<P>But as I have now represented <HI>Iustice</HI> and <HI>Mercy</HI> to you to be the same thing, so at some other meeting I shall shew you that <HI>Dispensation</HI> and <HI>Mercy</HI> are the same: And in the mean while I shall tell you that there was a time namely throughout the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and in part of the Reign of King <HI>Iames</HI> the First, when the Learning about <HI>Dispensations</HI> was not in <HI>England,</HI> Dark <HI>learning,</HI> but generally understood, and that not only by the Writers of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> but by the <HI>Puritan</HI> Writers: and I shall shew you when this <HI>learning</HI> went to sleep, and which I account not to have been again awaken'd till in the Conjuncture of <HI>Thomas</HI> and <HI>Sorrel</HI>'s Case. But when I come to entertain you with the learned <HI>Notions</HI> about it out of some of our <HI>Church of</HI> England-<HI>Writers,</HI> I believe you will not in the least <HI>startle</HI> at the thoughts of your Prince's <HI>dispensing</HI> with <HI>disability.</HI></P>
<P>One of those Writers writ of the Subject before <HI>Suarez,</HI> and whose Book I suppose that our Excellent Bishop <HI>Taylor</HI> happen'd not to have read, be|cause I met with no references to it in his <HI>Ductor dubitantium,</HI> and where probably there had been many, had the <HI>Bishop</HI> read it. The <HI>Book</HI> speaks the <HI>Author</HI> to have been profoundly knowing in the <HI>Civil</HI> and <HI>Canon</HI> Law, and not unacquainted with the <HI>Lex terrae,</HI> and one who (I think) made a great <HI>figure</HI> in the Administration of the <HI>Discipline</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> and whose great <HI>talents</HI> might probably cause our great <HI>Church|men</HI> then to engage him for their <HI>Champion</HI> against some of the <HI>Puritan</HI> Writers, who look'd with an <HI>evil</HI> eye on the Regal <HI>dispensing</HI> with disabi|lity or <HI>incapacity</HI> in many of our Clergy-men. And as when of old some of the <HI>English-understandings</HI> were employ'd in the writing of <HI>School-Divinity,</HI> they penetrated as far into the Subtleties of it as those of any Nation, so I may tell you that (in my poor opinion) that <HI>Author</HI> hath writ of the Learn|ing of <HI>Dispensations</HI> both with all the <HI>subtlety</HI> and <HI>solidity</HI> requisite, and more substantially then <HI>Suarez.</HI> I shall lay the Book before you at our next meeting, but shall now tell you, that as to some Points we have been discoursing, he observes that <HI>There is a Dispensation call'd of Iustice, as it were, an Interpretation or Declaration of the true meaning of the Law</HI> juxta aequum &amp; bonum: <HI>and he cites the Canon Law to prove that Dispensation is a due, for that the Precept of Mercy is common to all.</HI> And I may tell you here, that if you will look on your <HI>Durand</HI>'s <HI>Speculum</HI> in his first <HI>Volume,</HI> where he writes so copiously of <HI>Dispensing,</HI> his <HI>style</HI> is, <HI>Dispensatio sive mi|sericordia.</HI></P>

is more pleasant to me then to find an <HI>Historical</HI> account of the <HI>Progress</HI> of any Controverted Point of any <HI>learning</HI> that hath made a <HI>ferment</HI> in Church or State.

<P>It hath been the luck of <HI>Dispensation</HI> to meet with an ill name from some of our famous <HI>Writers,</HI> who tell us that there were no such things as <HI>Dispen|sation</HI> or <HI>Non-obstante</HI> heard of till they came from <HI>Rome</HI> here in the <HI>year</HI> of our Lord 1240. <HI>and that afterward Kings learn'd from Popes to dispense with their Laws, whereas before they caus'd their Laws to be observ'd like those of the</HI> Medes <HI>and</HI> Persians; as the <HI>Irish Reports</HI> tell you in the <HI>Case</HI> of <HI>Com|mendams,</HI> and whereupon Mr. <HI>Prynne</HI> on the <HI>Fourth Part of the Institutes,</HI> c. 22. treating largely of <HI>Non-obstantes</HI> calls them <HI>Papal Engines.</HI> And our old <HI>Monkish</HI> Writers have been quoted for bestowing the terms of <HI>legum vul|nera, infames nuncii,</HI> and <HI>repagalum,</HI> &amp;c. on <HI>Dispensations</HI> and <HI>Non|obstantes.</HI></P>
<P>But I shall at our meeting again shew you that the practice of <HI>Dispen|sing</HI> may easily be traced to the <HI>Imperial</HI> Laws: and this you may soon find, if you will look on Dr. <HI>Donne's Pseudo-Martyr</HI> that you have by you, and where you may guess at the age of <HI>Dispensations,</HI> by his referring you in <HI>p.</HI> 40. to the <HI>Divinae Indulgentiae,</HI> in the <HI>Digests,</HI> and his telling you out of the <HI>Code</HI> that <HI>Theodosius</HI> and <HI>Valentinian making a Law with a</HI> Non-obstante <HI>did praeclude all Dispensations which the Emperors themselves might grant, in these words,</HI> Si coeleste proferatur oraculum, aut divina pragmatica Sanctio.</P>
<P>And if you will look on <HI>Gothofred</HI>'s Notes on the <HI>L. Iubemus. C. De Sa|crosanctis Ecclefiis &amp; de rebus &amp; Privilegiis earum,</HI> cited by the Doctor there, you will thus find it in those <HI>Notes: Caeleste oraculum quid est? Principis dispensatio.</HI></P>
<P>There is another thing I have not had time now to Discourse with you about, and that is of the <HI>Nature</HI> of Laws <HI>in terrorem,</HI> as I intended, and which suitably to the Wisdom of a Father in menacing a Child with cut|ting off his Head if he doth this or that thing, are by the <HI>Pater Patriae</HI> and the Estates of the Realm sometimes lawfully made to <HI>intimidate</HI> men grown childish and vain, by Sanctions of Punishments not intended to be execu|ted according to the general <HI>tenour</HI> of such <HI>Laws.</HI> But as what may make for my purpose of shewing you how worthy it is of the <HI>Majesty</HI> of <HI>Princes</HI>
<PB N="126" REF="67">
to incorporate <HI>Mercy</HI> with <HI>Iustice</HI> in <HI>dispensing</HI> with many particular Per|sons, and even to the freeing them from the <HI>terror</HI> of <HI>those</HI> Laws in some angry Conjunctures when others were to be affrighted with them, I shall refer you to King <HI>Iames</HI> his <HI>Proclamation</HI> of <HI>Iune</HI> the <HI>10th,</HI> in the <HI>year</HI> 1606. and where having mentioned the Religion of the Roman-Catholicks, he saith, <HI>We de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">&iuml;re still to make it appear in the whole Course of of our Government, that we are far from accounting all those Subjects Dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">oyal that are that way affected, and that we do DISTINGUISH of such as be carry'd only with blind zeal, and such as sin out of Pre|sumption,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and therefore as after times must give us tryal of ALL mens behaviour, so must all men expect that their own deserts must be the only measure of their Fortunes at our hands either one way or other:</HI> and having before spoke of the Gun-Powder Treason, and the <HI>Doctrines</HI> of some <HI>Priests</HI> that might encourage it, and said that <HI>thereby there is suffi|cient Cause to justifie the Proceedings of us and our said Parliament in the making and execution of these last and all other former Statutes tending to the same end,</HI> it followeth, <HI>nevertheless seeing the Soveraign Care ap|pertains to us who have the Soveraign Power of Iustice in our hand, and the Supreme Dispensation of Clemency and Moderation of the Severity of our Laws is likewise as proper to us to use, whensoever we shall find it reasonable, the same deserving to be no less allow'd in us (being in our Dominions God's Lieutenant) then it is prais'd in him among whose highest titles it is that his Mercy is above all his Works,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The <HI>King</HI> in the <HI>beginning</HI> of his <HI>Proclamation</HI> having profess'd his <HI>Zeal</HI> for the <HI>Religion</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> by Law <HI>Establish'd,</HI> and his <HI>constant Resolution for the maintenance and defence thereof,</HI> said, <HI>Of which our purpose and determination, beside all other our former pro|ceedings (since our Entry into this Kingdom) we have given a new and certain Demonstration by such two Acts as have been passed in this Session of our Parliament, both tending to prevent the Dangers and diminish the number of those who adhering to the Profession of the Church of</HI> Rome, <HI>are blindly led (together with the Superstition of their Religion) both into some points of Doctrine which cannot consist with the Loyalty of Subjects toward their Prince, and oft-times into direct actions of Conspiracies and Conjurations against the State where|in they live, as hath most notoriously appear'd by the late most horrible and almost incredible Conjuration,</HI> &amp;c. The <HI>two Acts</HI> there referr'd to are those that you will find in your <HI>Statute-Book,</HI> Anno tertio Jacobi Regis, <HI>cap.</HI> 4. <HI>An Act for the Discovering and repressing Popish Recusants</HI> (and in which the Oath of Allegiance is contain'd) and <HI>Cap.</HI> 5. <HI>An Act to prevent and avoid dangers by Popish Recusants,</HI> and whereby Popish Recusants Con|vict are <HI>disabled</HI> from bearing <HI>Office.</HI> But here you see how that wise Prince so soon after so horrid a real <HI>Plot</HI> did by <HI>distinguishing</HI> in his <HI>Procla|mation</HI> between the <HI>Principles</HI> of <HI>some</HI> Roman-Catholicks and <HI>others</HI> as to Loyalty, and alluring the Loyal by the avow'd <HI>Dispensative</HI> Power of his <HI>Mercy,</HI> and hiding them under the <HI>wings</HI> of his <HI>Mercy</HI> from the <HI>terror</HI> of his Laws and affording to <HI>all his Subjects</HI> who should afterward <HI>behave</HI> themselves <HI>well,</HI> a <HI>Tabula post naufragium</HI> as to the <HI>expectance</HI> of making up their <HI>fortunes,</HI> think himself obliged then to cause <HI>his Moderation to be known to all men.</HI></P>
<P>And you may hence take occasion when you think of the many <HI>Acts in terrorem</HI> in the <HI>Statute-Book,</HI> and where there is no <HI>Proportion</HI> between the <HI>Crime</HI> and the <HI>Punishment,</HI> and in some that <HI>seem</HI> inflictive of Punish|ments

<P>I might here likewise as to many <HI>Acts</HI> about <HI>Trade</HI> that swell the <HI>Statute|Book</HI> apply the Consideration of the Regal Power of <HI>dispensing</HI> therein ha|ving encouraged our <HI>Ancestors</HI> to perpetuate them as Laws.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>The truth is you now put me in mind how I having long ago spent much time in considering the <HI>Trade</HI> and <HI>Traffick</HI> of our Country, and of other Parts of <HI>Christendom,</HI> and finding that shortly after His late <HI>Majesty's</HI> Restoration, one of his <HI>Ministers</HI> had in a Publick <HI>Speech</HI> intimated it to the <HI>Parliament,</HI> that <HI>His Majesty had setled a Councel of Trade, consisting of some of the Lords of his Privy Councel, and of some Gentlemen of Quality and Experience, and of some Principal Merchants of the Principal Companies,</HI> I had the curiosity to look over their <HI>Iournals</HI> and their <HI>Advices,</HI> and <HI>Reports</HI> to the King, and there I found somewhat of the same <HI>notion</HI> with yours in one of their <HI>Reports</HI> to His Majesty. For there in one of their Papers of <HI>Advice</HI> addressed to the King, taking notice that what they conceived fit to be done for the <HI>advancement</HI> of the <HI>Trade</HI> of the <HI>Realm,</HI> was <HI>Prohibited</HI> by <HI>divers</HI> ancient <HI>Statutes,</HI> they make them <HI>imply</HI> that the thing might be done by the King's <HI>licence</HI> or <HI>dispensing,</HI> and whereupon they thus go on: <HI>And therefore finding this Dispensation to be your Majesty's Prerogative preserv'd entire to the Crown through so many of your Royal Progenitors, we have not thought fit to touch further upon this Matter, as being humbly confident that your Majesty's Subjects shall upon all occasions be indulged the like, if not more ready relief and accommodation for their Trade from your Majesty's Royal Grace and Bounty: only because the Observation was obvious, that perhaps all former Parliaments purposely left this door open to the People by the Grace of the King to be reliev'd with those dispensations, as foreseeing how difficult, if not impossi|ble, or how inconvenient at least it might be altogether to restrain</HI> what those <HI>Statutes</HI> prohibited, <HI>we could not omit the same in this place,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you have put me in mind how a very Loyal and judicious <HI>Gen|tleman</HI> of that <HI>Councel</HI> of <HI>Trade,</HI> (and whom I look on to be as deeply <HI>study'd</HI> in the business of Trade and Traffick as any one of the age) was pleas'd once to give me his opinion in Discourse, that a <HI>vast</HI> number of our <HI>Statutes</HI> made for the <HI>advancement</HI> of <HI>Trade</HI> did really <HI>depress</HI> it; and he then told me, that the making of one new <HI>Law</HI> against the giving <HI>Alms</HI> to <HI>Beggars</HI> in the High-way, would enrich the Nation almost more then all our <HI>old</HI> Statutes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have many times been apt to think so. And considering how great a part of Mankind every where the <HI>Credulous</HI> are, and that the <HI>Beggars</HI>
<PB N="128" REF="68">
are a necessary <HI>Tax</HI> upon the <HI>Credulous;</HI> as we must imagine that a great <HI>loss</HI> happens to the well-meaning People in the Nation through the <HI>Profu|sion</HI> of their Charity to <HI>Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">pers</HI> in the High ways or Streets, so again con|sidering the vast <HI>numbers&punc;</HI> of such <HI>Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">pers,</HI> and how valuable their <HI>Industry</HI> would be to the Publick, if <HI>Necessity the mother of Industry</HI> through their not being relieved in the High-ways or Streets made them advantageous to the Kingdom instead of being <HI>Nuisances</HI> to it, one may easily guess that an <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> of that Nature would awaken Trade and Manufacture to a much higher Proportion than our many sleeping <HI>Statutes</HI> can do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, then; I must tell you what I told him, namely, that there is such a <HI>Statute</HI> in <HI>being,</HI> and long ago made, and that the <HI>execution</HI> of this <HI>Statute</HI> hath been in the populous <HI>Suburbs</HI> of our <HI>Metropolis</HI> (the places where Peggars do so much swarm) often awaken'd within these <HI>late</HI> years by the <HI>Middlesex-Iustices</HI> causing <HI>Printed</HI> Papers to be sent to the <HI>Church|wardens</HI> and <HI>Overseers</HI> of the <HI>Poor</HI> in the respective Parishes, and with this <HI>Clause</HI> therein inserted, <HI>viz. And for the discouragement of all idle Vagabonds and Vagrants,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>all Persons are hereby desired and required to forbear to relieve any Beggars at their doors, or in any other kind about the Streets, on pain of suffering the respective Penalties by Law provided against all such Offenders.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never before heard of this <HI>Penal</HI> Law.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may find it <HI>referr'd</HI> to, and likewise what may shew you how it hath been <HI>tacitly</HI> dispensed with, in my Lord <HI>Hatton's Treatise of Acts of Parliament and the Exposition thereof,</HI> c. 5. <HI>Of Interpretation of Statutes by Equity:</HI> and where he saith, <HI>The Statute of</HI> E. 3. <HI>ordaineth, That no ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> upon pain of Imprisonment should give Alms to a valtant Beggar. Yet if one meet with such a one in so cold weather and so light apparel, that if he have no Clothes given him he shall die before he comes to any Town, if a man giveth him apparel, he offends not the Law. For there is an inward dispensation by the bond of Christian Charity and Compassion.</HI></P>
<P>But since <HI>humane</HI> Laws <HI>bind</HI> the <HI>Conscience,</HI> we cannot without the <HI>Prin|ce's</HI> tacit <HI>Consent</HI> rationally to be <HI>presumed,</HI> thus give our selves the <HI>Latitude</HI> of an <HI>internal dispensation,</HI> or <HI>relaxation</HI> from the <HI>band</HI> of that his Law: So that therefore when ever you <HI>gratifie</HI> your own indulgent disposition in <HI>relieving</HI> one in the Streets, or <HI>in itinere</HI> whom you look on as one of <HI>God</HI>'s Poor, you are at the same time to be sensible of the Regal <HI>dispensative</HI> Power <HI>relieving</HI> your <HI>Conscience,</HI> and <HI>legitimating</HI> that your intended Charity by <HI>Tacit</HI> Dispensation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have often <HI>referr'd</HI> my Thoughts to consider the Nature of the Prince's <HI>Tacit</HI> dispensing. Do you account it to have any great spreading <HI>Influence</HI> on mens <HI>Consciences</HI> here in keeping them both <HI>innocent</HI> and <HI>quiet?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>When we meet some other time, I shall shew you the <HI>Universal</HI> in|fluence of this kind it hath among all <HI>Orders</HI> and <HI>Degrees</HI> of our Prince's <HI>Sub|jects:</HI> and I shall then give you a full view of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>But will you then tell me of <HI>Disability</HI> being thus <HI>tacitly</HI> dispens'd with, and with a <HI>salvo</HI> to Conscience as to the <HI>obligation</HI> of <HI>humane</HI> Laws?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; in many Cases. I have told you of one already when the Roman-Catholick <HI>Physicians</HI> were <HI>disabled</HI> by an <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Iames</HI> the First from Practising, and when the Regal <HI>Tacit</HI> Dispensa|tion proved an effectual Antidote to their Consciences against mortal Sin in the Case. But because you seem to be somewhat <HI>impatient</HI> to know ano|ther <HI>Case</HI> wherein the <HI>Tacit</HI> Dispensation with <HI>disability</HI> did thus <HI>operate,</HI> I shall give you a <HI>home-case,</HI> by desiring you to recollect how <HI>old</HI> you were
<PB N="129" REF="68">
when you were first chosen a Parliament man, and then to read Mr. <HI>Prynne</HI>'s Book publish'd <HI>A.</HI> 1661. and call'd <HI>Minors no Senators, or a brief Discourse proving Infants under</HI> 21 <HI>years to be uncapable in point of Law,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>of being elected or admitted Members of the High Court of Parliament,</HI> &amp;c. He re|fers there to <HI>Coke's Institutes</HI> for rendring none <HI>eligible</HI> to be a <HI>Knight, Citi|zen</HI> or <HI>Burgess,</HI> who is under the <HI>age</HI> of 21 <HI>years:</HI> and in <HI>p.</HI> 5. he faith, <HI>the Common Law of</HI> England <HI>is so exact and curious in the Election of all Officers of an inferior Nature, as Coroners, Verderers, Keepers of Seals for Recogni|sances, or Statutes Merchant, Constables, Bailiffs, Mayors, Clerks and others, who are eligible by Writs, Charters or Prescription, that it expresly requires every one of them to be</HI> idoneum hominem qui melius sciat &amp; possit officium illud intendere, <HI>and therefore</HI> (saith he) <HI>much less ought a Minor to be cho|sen a Knight, Citizen, or Burgess,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and if he is unable to be an Attorney or Proxy to assent for another in any Court of Iustice, much more then in a Parliament, the supremest Court.</HI> And in <HI>p.</HI> 24. to the <HI>Objection</HI> that <HI>some Infants under</HI> 21 <HI>years have been permitted to sit in former Parliaments,</HI> he answers, <HI>that no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e ever sate in former Parliaments but only by Connivence, and whose Elections were never question'd, and that some whose Elections were question'd, were ejected.</HI></P>
<P>And now as Bishop <HI>Sanderson</HI> in his 7th <HI>Lecture,</HI> viz. <HI>De Legum humana|rum Caus&acirc; efficiente,</HI> speaking of <HI>Laws ceasing to oblige by contrary Custom,</HI> makes that contrary Custom to be <HI>nihil aliud quam Conjuncta populi Consen|sio eam legem ut inutilem observare negligentis, &amp; Consensio principis Obser|vationem ejus non exigentis;</HI> and in his 10th <HI>Lecture</HI> doth very judiciously distinguish the Prince's <HI>Consent</HI> about relaxing Subjects from the obligation of a Law into <HI>that which is express'd,</HI> and <HI>that which may rationally be pre|sumed,</HI> it was by this <HI>latter</HI> consent of your <HI>Prince</HI> so exuberantly indul|gent in his Nature, that you were brought off from <HI>Sin</HI> in the <HI>forum inter|num,</HI> when you were both <HI>Senator</HI> and <HI>Minor,</HI> and when you help'd on the making of Laws to <HI>disalle</HI> others, and who have since made it a <HI>question</HI> whether the King could <HI>expresly</HI> or <HI>tacitly</HI> dispense with the <HI>incapacity</HI> that by means of your Vote, and perhaps of other <HI>Minors,</HI> passed to be <HI>enacted</HI> as a Punishment.</P>
<P>But to speak frankly, you will oblige me now we are so near parting, to tell me of any one learned Man in the Profession of the Laws of any part of Christendom, and particularly of our own <HI>Municipal</HI> ones, who hath <HI>ex Professo</HI> and <HI>argumentatively</HI> writ of the Prince's <HI>Prerogative</HI> of <HI>dispensing</HI> with a Penal <HI>disability</HI> in <HI>particular</HI> Cases, and deny'd it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not as to our <HI>Lex terrae</HI> account it <HI>tanti</HI> to set up the Judgment of any one particular man when you have entertain'd me with <HI>Iudgment</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> in the Case. But I am sure you cannot but know how that great Man in that great <HI>Case</HI> we have referr'd to, I mean my Lord Chief Justice <HI>Vaughan</HI> in <HI>Thomas</HI> and <HI>Sorrel</HI>'s Case, seems to be of opinion that the <HI>King</HI> cannot <HI>dispense</HI> in the <HI>Case</HI> of <HI>Incapacity:</HI> He saith, <HI>the reason why the King cannot dispense in the Cases of buying Offices and Simoniacal Presenta|tions is because the Persons were made incapable to hold them: And a Person incapable is as a dead Person, and no Person at all as to that wherein he is in|capable,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tho that <HI>great</HI> Man hath not therein as in other <HI>Passages</HI> in his <HI>Ar|gument,</HI> discuss'd the Point <HI>argumentatively,</HI> I shall yet pay so much respect to his opinion, as to give decent Burial to his <HI>dead Man.</HI> But you see that after he had said, <HI>The Reason why the King cannot dispense,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>is because the Persons were made incapable to hold them,</HI> he only gives it as a <HI>reason</HI> of their being <HI>uncapable,</HI> and of the King's not being able to <HI>dispense</HI> in their
<PB N="130" REF="69">
Case, <HI>viz.</HI> that they are dead Men, <HI>that a Person uncapable is as a dead Per|son,</HI> and whereby he giveth us a Magisterial <HI>gratis dictum,</HI> or a <HI>Petitio Principii</HI> instead of what might deserve the <HI>name</HI> of a <HI>Reason,</HI> or what might prove that the <HI>King</HI> could not <HI>dispense</HI> in the <HI>Case</HI> of one <HI>Politically</HI> dead, or one <HI>dead</HI> in <HI>Law.</HI> I have formerly told you of the <HI>Saying</HI> used by <HI>Magerus,</HI> and other <HI>Civil Law-writers,</HI> that <HI>Mors civilis naturali non aequi|paratur nisi in casibus in jure expressis.</HI> And there are Cases enow express'd there, that shew how the Prince who is according to the style of <HI>Seneca,</HI> viz. <HI>Animus Reipublicae, illa Corpus suum,</HI> and <HI>ille spiritus vitalis quem haec tot millia trahunt,</HI> and who in the <HI>Scripture</HI> Phrase is <HI>the breath of our No|strils,</HI> can according to the <HI>Law</HI> of the <HI>Land</HI> as <HI>I</HI> told you in the <HI>Case</HI> of Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI> animate a Person <HI>dead</HI> in <HI>Law.</HI></P>
<P>And none need question why King <HI>Iames</HI> the <HI>Second</HI> cannot thus <HI>raise</HI> the <HI>dead</HI> as Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> did, and King <HI>Iames</HI> the <HI>First,</HI> or our following Princes, and I may say as well as any who went before him. <HI>Infames di|cuntur civiliter mortui</HI> is a common Saying, but you see that <HI>Fas est cuivis Principi maculosas notas vitiatae opinionis abstergere</HI> is as common. Thus too <HI>Magerus</HI> tells us, that <HI>Banniti pro mortuis reputantur,</HI> and we know that the <HI>Excommunicate</HI> may in some respect by reason of their temporary <HI>disa|bility</HI> be termed so too.</P>
<P>And if you will look on the Book call'd <HI>Reformatio legum Ecclesiasticarum,</HI> under the title <HI>De excommunicatione,</HI> you will there in the <HI>Chapter</HI> of the <HI>Denunciation of the Excommunicate,</HI> find the <HI>Minister</HI> enjoin'd to <HI>tell</HI> the <HI>People that they must all abstain from the Excommunicate Person,</HI> tan|quam &agrave; Putri &amp; Projecto membro, <HI>&amp;c. that an Excommunicate Person is to be thrown out of the Church as a dead Carcass:</HI> but you will there find in the <HI>Formula reconciliationis excommunicatorum</HI> with what tenderness it is said <HI>reum hunc charissimum fratrem membrum assumamus &amp; agnoscamus Communis in Christo nostri corporis: &amp; intimus ut no|ster affectus in hoc corporis nostri recuperato membro testatior sit,</HI> &amp;c. and that the Pastor in the Absolution of that returning <HI>Prodigal</HI> who was <HI>dead</HI> and is <HI>alive again,</HI> must in the administration of the <HI>King</HI>'s Ecclesiastical <HI>Laws,</HI> say <HI>tibi rursus pristinum in Ecclesi&acirc; tu&acirc; locum, &amp; plenum jus restitue.</HI></P>
<P>Thus too at the <HI>end</HI> of the <HI>Canons,</HI> A. 1571. you will find the same <HI>style</HI> of <HI>tenderness</HI> in <HI>Vogue</HI> in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s time that was in <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>6th's,</HI> as likewise of the powerfulness in <HI>raising</HI> the <HI>dead.</HI> You see there a Form of the <HI>Sentence</HI> of <HI>Excommunication,</HI> viz. <HI>Fratres quoniam quicunque profitemur nomen Christi sumus omnes membrum ejusdem corporis, &amp; par est ut unum membrum alterius membri sensu &amp; dolore afficiatur,</HI> &amp;c. And it being afterward mention'd, that <HI>the Person having been accused of such a Crime, and having been contumaciously absent,</HI> it followeth, <HI>the Bishop in God's Name and by his Authority hath Excommunicated such a one from the Socie|ty of Christ's Church,</HI> &amp; tanquam membrum emortuum amputasse &agrave; Christi corpore, &amp;c. <HI>that you may shun his Company:</HI> tamen ut Christiana charitas nos monet, <HI>let us pray for him to God who is a merciful God, and who can</HI> lapsos etiam &agrave; morte revocare.</P>
<P>And you may take notice of what is said in <HI>Croke</HI> 2d, and <HI>Coke</HI> 8th <HI>Report, Trollop's Case</HI> about the King's <HI>Pardon</HI> raising the <HI>Excommunicate</HI> from this <HI>civil</HI> death, and that a man need not be <HI>Absolved</HI> by the <HI>Church</HI> if the King <HI>Pardons.</HI> And thus <HI>Hobart, Serle</HI>'s Case, <HI>p.</HI> 294. shews you that after the <HI>discharge</HI> of a <HI>Clerk Convict,</HI> he shall never be <HI>question'd</HI> in the <HI>Ec|clesiastical</HI> Court for <HI>deprivation.</HI> You may likewise see it in <HI>Coke</HI> Inst. 3. Chapter <HI>Of Pardons,</HI> The <HI>King</HI> may <HI>Pardon</HI> one <HI>Convict</HI> of <HI>Heresie,</HI> or of any other offence <HI>Punishable</HI> by the <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> Law.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="69">You may too in that <HI>Chapter</HI> observe his tenderness for <HI>Prerogative,</HI> where having mention'd that <HI>by the 13th of</HI> R. 2. <HI>it is provided that no Charter of Pardon for Murther,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>shall be allow'd</HI> &amp;c. <HI>if they be not spe|cify'd in the same Charter, and that before that Statute by the Pardon of all Felonies, Treason was Pardon'd, and so was Murder; and at this day by the pardon of all Felonies, the death of a Man is not pardon'd;</HI> he thus goeth on, <HI>these are excellent Laws for direction, and for the Peace of the Realm.

My Lord <HI>Coke</HI> then saith, <HI>This is to be added that the intention of the said Act,</HI> 13.

<P>I do observe that many <HI>presume</HI> to censure <HI>Kings</HI> for so doing, and are superstitiously misguided by thinking that those two places of <HI>Scripture</HI> re|ferr'd to by my Lord <HI>Coke</HI> do necessarily make it a sin in Princes to <HI>Pardon</HI> Murther.

<P>I shall be glad to hear you discourse of this, and the rather for that 'tis so Customary to many when they find the <HI>Prince</HI> exercising this <HI>Pre|rogative</HI> of <HI>Pardoning,</HI> to be apt too much to busy their heads with those <HI>two</HI> places in the <HI>Old</HI> Testament, to their neglect of others there&punc; <HI>viz.

<P>I shall tell you of a <HI>Case</HI> that was well enough known to him, and which you may find in <HI>Croke</HI> 3d, <HI>p.</HI> 55. Sir <HI>Iohn Bennet,</HI> v. Dr. <HI>Easedale:</HI> where you may see that Sir <HI>Iohn Bennet</HI> being <HI>fined</HI> 20000 <HI>l.</HI> for <HI>Bribery&punc;</HI> by the <HI>Star-Chamber,</HI> and <HI>Censured to be Imprison'd, and made uncapable of any Office of Iudicature: and that he having a Pardon from the King re|citing the Bribery and Offences mention'd in the Decree, and all Penalties and Punishments by reason thereof, and all Disabilities and Incapacities, and all things concerning the said Sentence except the Fine of</HI> 20000 l. and the <HI>Court of Star-Chamber having the advice of all the Iudges relating to the Decree and Pardon, it was resolv'd by them all, that this Pardon hath taken away all force of the Sentence in the Star-Chamber, except for the Fine of</HI> 20000 l. <HI>and all Disabilities are discharged thereby.</HI></P>
<P>That <HI>Lord Chief Iustice</HI> knew that (as it was set down in that <HI>Chapter</HI> of <HI>Pardons,</HI> Inst. 3.) the <HI>King's Pardon</HI> extends to all <HI>Suits</HI> in the <HI>Star-Cham|ber:</HI> and he knew of what was mention'd, <HI>Inst.</HI> 4. <HI>Chap.</HI> 1. <HI>Of the High Court of Parliament,</HI> viz. <HI>Of a Pardon to the Lord</HI> Latimer <HI>of a Iudgment in Parliament:</HI> and he knew that by his own and other <HI>Iustices</HI> of <HI>Assize</HI> go|ing into their <HI>own</HI> Countrys in the <HI>Execution</HI> of their <HI>Offices</HI> by vertue of the King's <HI>Non-obstante</HI> to the <HI>Statutes</HI> of 8. <HI>R.</HI> 2. c. 2. 3. <HI>H.</HI> 8. c. 24. himself and as many as went <HI>Iudges</HI> of <HI>Assize</HI> so into their <HI>own</HI> Countrys, gave Judgment by so doing for the <HI>Prerogative</HI> of <HI>dispensing</HI> with such <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Par|liament:</HI> and he likewise knew that (as it is well express'd in <HI>The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> Answer of King</HI> Charles <HI>the First to the Declaration of both Houses of Parliament concerning the Commission&punc; of array,</HI> A. 1642.) <HI>An Act of Parliament in any&punc; Matter tho mistaken, being assented to by the King and his two Houses, is equally binding (as having equal Authority) with an Act introductive of a new Law,</HI> and that therefore <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> having so particularly <HI>de|clared</HI> the justness of the Prerogative's <HI>dispensing</HI> with <HI>disability,</HI> no <HI>magna nomina</HI> of any particular <HI>Sages</HI> of the <HI>Law</HI> in otherwise <HI>opining,</HI> can expect any deference.</P>

<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well Sir: As for this <HI>objected</HI> Dead-man, <HI>requiescat in Pace.</HI> I have done with him: and since from some things you have said, I gather that the <HI>dispensing</HI> with <HI>disability</HI> by <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors and <HI>Popes</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> did never by any <HI>ferment</HI> disturb their Governments; and moreover, since no men of sense here have ever troubled themselves or the Government with any vexatious <HI>Question</HI> about the King's Power in discharging a man from a <HI>Praemunire,</HI> but not from a Penal <HI>disability</HI> incurr'd, whereas by <HI>a Praemu|nire</HI> (as my Lord <HI>Coke</HI> shews us, <HI>Inst.</HI> 3. c. 54.) <HI>men are put out of the Protection of the King, and DISABLED to have any Action or Remedy by the King's Law or the Kings Writs,</HI> and exposed to many other dread|ful
<PB N="133" REF="70">
<HI>Punishments:</HI> I do now begin to wonder whence it is that the mistake in some mens Minds hath come about a <HI>Penal</HI> disability being so unremove|able. And thus I think too one might wonder how such as will allow the King's <HI>Pardon</HI> to discharge one from an <HI>Excommunicatio minor</HI> or <HI>major,</HI> do look on <HI>disability</HI> as such an <HI>anathematizing</HI> thing as is not to be touch'd or that cannot be quell'd by Prerogative. Can you guess whence it is that men have imbibed this mistaken fancy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall frankly tell you what I think hath occasion'd it. It is most natural to all men in arguing to take the shortest course they can to bring their Adversaries to what is reputed by all to be an <HI>absurdity;</HI> and there being some <HI>Disabilities</HI> that the <HI>Law-Books</HI> mention wherein <HI>Property</HI> is concern'd, and wherein it appears as an <HI>absurd</HI> thing in any one who should say that they could be <HI>dispens'd</HI> with, and as for Example, what the <GAP DESC="foreign"> tells us of <HI>Disability, where a man is not of whole Memory, which dis|ables him so that his Heir shall take advantage of his Disability after his death: and where he passeth any Estate out of him it may be after his death disanull'd by his Heir, and which cannot be disanull'd by himself during his life. For it is a Maxim of Law, That a man of full Age shall ne|ver be receiv'd to disable his own Person:</HI> and for which he cites Sir <HI>E. Coke.</HI> And he had before spoke of <HI>Disability by the Persons own Act, which is, if I bind my self that upon surrender of a Lease, I will grant a new Estate to the Lessee, and afterward I grant over my reversion, in this Case tho I afterward repurchase the reversion, yet I have forfeited my Obligation because I was once disabled to perform it,</HI> Coke <HI>lib.</HI> 5. <HI>f.</HI> 21.</P>
<P>Thus likewise it appearing to be against <HI>reason</HI> that men should be made <HI>Iudges</HI> who are under <HI>natural</HI> incapacities to exercise Jurisdiction, (and such as <HI>Vantius</HI> in his <HI>Book</HI> de <HI>Nullitatibus</HI> instancing in, as, <HI>Surdus, mutus, perpetu&ograve; furiosus, impubes,</HI> saith, that <HI>quoniam defectus &amp; incapacitas istorum &agrave; natur&acirc; ips&acirc; provenit, ideo &agrave; quoquam etiam Supremo Principe suppleri non poterit (quia etiam Imperatori tollere non licet quae juris naturalis sunt)</HI> an asserting of the Power of <HI>Prerogative</HI> in <HI>dispensing</HI> with such incapacity would be <HI>absurd;</HI> and it would shew somewhat of <HI>laesa Principia</HI> and of <HI>natural defects and incapacities</HI> in one who did rear <HI>Suppositions</HI> of a <HI>Prince's</HI> intending to employ such <HI>Uncapables:</HI> and however nothing appearing to the first thought more <HI>ridiculous</HI> then a <HI>dispensing</HI> with incapacity of this kind, many may be so apt to think that incapacities <HI>enacted</HI> by Penal po|sitive Laws, (and by such Laws perhaps as were made <HI>in terrorem</HI>) can|not be <HI>dispensed</HI> with.</P>
<P>But <HI>in fine,</HI> when we meet hereafter, I shall give occasion to both our thoughts for a higher flight, then they had in that poor low <HI>Question, Can the King dispense with Penal Disability?</HI> and I shall shew you that where the <HI>King</HI> can as to any particular man <HI>relax</HI> the <HI>bond</HI> of his <HI>Law,</HI> let the most penetrating Wisdom of <HI>Men</HI> or <HI>Angels</HI> be employ'd in the settlement and <HI>invention</HI> of the most terrible <HI>Penalties</HI> to guard the Law, the Person so <HI>dispens'd</HI> with is <HI>ipso facto</HI> and <HI>ipso jure</HI> freed from them all. He by be|ing <HI>exempted</HI> from the <HI>Obligation</HI> of that Law is as <HI>innocent</HI> and free from any <HI>Sin</HI> by the <HI>transgression</HI> of it, as the <HI>Child</HI> unborn. The <HI>Dispensation</HI> hath intercepted all the <HI>Penalties;</HI> hath <HI>absolv'd</HI> him <HI>&agrave; culp&acirc;,</HI> and therefore <HI>&agrave; paena,</HI> and if you punish him, you punish an <HI>innocent</HI> Person.</P>

And I need not tell you again that at the time of the making of the <HI>Statute</HI> of 37^o of <HI>H.</HI> 8. and of the <HI>Revival</HI> of it by Queen <HI>Eliz.</HI> (and wherein it was <HI>declared</HI> that <HI>Archbishops, Bishops,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>have NO manner of Iurisdiction Ec|clesiastical but by, under and from His Royal Majesty</HI>) both <HI>Harry</HI> the <HI>8th,</HI> and that <HI>Queen,</HI> and the judicious in the <HI>Clergy</HI> of each knew that as to their <HI>Potestas Ordinis</HI> which by virtue of their Function they have to Preach, and give the <HI>Sacrament,</HI> and give <HI>Orders,</HI> &amp;c. it was <HI>derived</HI> from <HI>Christ</HI> to the <HI>Apostles</HI> and their <HI>Successors,</HI> and that so likewise was the <HI>Potestas Iu|risdictionis in foro interno,</HI> and that therefore none needed to suppose that either by <HI>Harry</HI> the <HI>8th's</HI> Oath or Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s, in the words of <HI>no foreign Prelates</HI> having here <HI>any Iurisdiction,</HI> &amp;c. any Power the Pope could justly claim as a <HI>Successor</HI> to the <HI>Apostles</HI> was impeach<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">d.</P>
<P>And no doubt but <HI>Harry</HI> the <HI>8th</HI> being by that <HI>Statute</HI> declared to be <HI>but a Lay-man,</HI> no men of sense construed that <HI>Statute</HI> to give him the ex|ercise of any <HI>Iurisdiction,</HI> or Power of the Keys <HI>in foro interno,</HI> as a <HI>Successor</HI> of the <HI>Apostles.</HI> The old <HI>Distinction</HI> of <HI>Bracton,</HI> l. 1. c. 8. that King's can|not Excommunicate <HI>ministerialiter</HI> (because they are Lay-men) but may do it <HI>authoritativ&egrave;</HI> by appointing others to do it, gave Satisfaction in <HI>Harry</HI> the <HI>8th's</HI> time, and might had it been thought of in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign have sav'd the labour of the <HI>Interpretation</HI> in the

<P>And it here coming into my mind that you in your somewhat <HI>airy</HI> way of discoursing of the Oath, resembled it to a <HI>tender-sided</HI> Ship <HI>girdled</HI> with so many interpretations, I shall take occasion further to impress it on your thoughts, that it is still <HI>THE SAME OATH,</HI> tho partaking of all those <HI>Interpretations,</HI> and as we say of <HI>eadem navis toties refecta:</HI> and the seve|ral interpretations are not by you to be resembled to <HI>girdlings,</HI> but to its main inward <HI>beams</HI> and <HI>timbers</HI> that are become <HI>parts</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> it. Moreover you know that a girdled Ship by reason of the incompactness of its <HI>adventitious</HI> parts with the other, cannot last the fourth part of the time that another will. But you see how long this <HI>Oath</HI> hath continued, and riding trium|phantly in the <HI>Sea</HI> of <HI>time,</HI> hath too carried out all its <HI>Guns</HI> in Stormy wea|ther, and made the Usurp'd Power of the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> strike Sail to our Princes.</P>
<P>Yet I shall here take occasion from my having just now <HI>minded</HI> you of the <HI>Interpretations</HI> of the <HI>Oath</HI> inclining Sir <HI>Iohn Winter</HI> and the <HI>other</HI> Roman-Catholick to judge of it as they did, to tell you that I have often wish'd that in the times of the three last <HI>Reigns</HI> the Power of <HI>Interpretation</HI> had further <HI>exerted</HI> it self in the further clearing of any thing in that <HI>Oath</HI> and in the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Allegiance</HI> at which <HI>offence</HI> was by so many <HI>taken,</HI> however by the <HI>Oaths</HI> not <HI>given:</HI> and that such <HI>Interpretations</HI> had been <HI>approved</HI> in <HI>Par|liament,</HI> and particularly that the <HI>Interpretation</HI> of the word <HI>HERETICAL</HI> in the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Allegiance,</HI> as being meant of <HI>Contrary to the Word of God,</HI> had brought all our Roman-Catholick Brethren to the <HI>taking</HI> of that <HI>Oath,</HI> as I told you that <HI>F. Cressy</HI> thought it would have done, and who said that he believed that that was the <HI>sense</HI> intended by King <HI>Iames</HI> in the word <HI>heretical.</HI></P>
<P>And I shall be glad if those <HI>Interpretations</HI> relating to the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Supre|macy</HI> which succeeded those that Sir <HI>Iohn Winter</HI> and the other <HI>Roman-Catholick</HI> took notice of, may in the event Conduce to render it more accep|table
<PB N="136" REF="72">
to others of them: and the rather for that it is apparent that all the <HI>Interpretations</HI> are <HI>Consistent</HI> with the <HI>Oath,</HI> and with <HI>one another,</HI> as from what I have spoken you may Collect. But by so many other Pious and Learned Roman-Catholicks appearing not to be of the opinion that the <HI>In|terpretations</HI> of the <HI>Oath</HI> mention'd by those <HI>two</HI> Writers, may legitimate the taking of it, I have long wish'd to the <HI>Oath</HI> all the additional clear|ness that Law could give it, and that they would wish given who were required to take it. And as one <HI>Doctor</HI>'s opinion for the justness of a <HI>Liti|gants</HI> Cause hath on his being cast in it, been allow'd to save him from being as a <HI>Calumnious</HI> and rash <HI>litigator</HI> condemned in Expences, thus so <HI>great a Master in</HI> our <HI>Israel</HI> and <HI>Vindicator</HI> of our <HI>Church</HI> from <HI>Schism,</HI> as Archbishop <HI>Bramhal</HI> having given his <HI>Opinion</HI> about the <HI>Oath</HI> (as I told you) namely as to what related to the <HI>King</HI>'s Power in <HI>Spirituals,</HI> and to <HI>no foreign Prelate</HI> having any Spiritual <HI>Iurisdiction</HI> here, <HI>viz. This might have been express'd in words less liable to Exception,</HI> I shall censure no man as a <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">umniator</HI> of the <HI>Oath</HI> who shall wish that any lawful <HI>Interpreta|tion</HI> may make those words <HI>less liable to Exception.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>Iohn Winter</HI> (as I told you) having mention'd <HI>the Explanations not being known to all, and their intricacy and the constant tendring of the Oath for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">o many years without the aforesaid Explanation as likely to give just cause of Scandal,</HI> &amp;c. I must tell you I like not his words of the <HI>GIVING just cause of Scandal;</HI> but what I have shew'd you of many <HI>passages</HI> about the <HI>Expla|nations</HI> which were not observ'd by him, and particularly of the 37th <HI>Ar|ticle</HI> affording only to the <HI>Clergy</HI> a more <HI>favourable</HI> interpretation (and which was <HI>enacted</HI> as to them in 13^o <HI>Eliz&punc;</HI>) and of the <HI>Canons</HI> of King <HI>Iames</HI> first extending the benefit of that <HI>Interpretation</HI> to the <HI>Layety,</HI> and of the <HI>Canons</HI> of King <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>First</HI> further explaining the 37th <HI>Article,</HI> may justly incline you to wish that the sense of the Oath did <HI>Prim&acirc; facie</HI> appear as <HI>liquid</HI> to all as it now doth to us two.</P>
<P>And I shall here take occasion for the propping up the interpretation re|lating to the <HI>Oath</HI> made by those <HI>two</HI> Princes in their <HI>Canons,</HI> to tell you that as you accounted King <HI>Iames</HI> his <HI>Interpretation</HI> as good as Queen <HI>Eli|zabeth</HI>'s, so you may account that in the <HI>Canons</HI> of King <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>First,</HI> as good as that in those of King <HI>Iames;</HI> for that tho it is said by some that the <HI>Canons</HI> of King <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>First</HI> were damned by the <HI>Act</HI> of 13^o <HI>Car.</HI> 2. c. 12. yet the truth is, that that Act leaves them in <HI>statu quo,</HI> and the last Proviso in it doth only express those <HI>Canons</HI> not being confirm'd by it. Nor (in my judgment) did they need any <HI>Confirmation</HI> from it: for that (accor|ding to my Lord Chief Justice <HI>Vaughan</HI>'s Opinion that <HI>I</HI> have cited to you) <HI>a lawful Canon is the Law of the Kingdom as well as an Act of Parliament:</HI> and the Consideration of this may shew you, that as Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Inter|pretation in <HI>The Admonition</HI> was perpetuated by the Ensuing <HI>Parliamentary</HI> Approbation thereof, so the interpretations of those Princes in those their <HI>Canons</HI> confirm'd for them, their <HI>Heirs</HI> and <HI>Successors,</HI> are now binding to you; and <HI>I</HI> pray God to incline you to <HI>keep</HI> this your <HI>Solemn</HI> Oath according to these <HI>interpretations</HI> of it.</P>

<P><HI>I</HI> thank you for this your <HI>serious</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> wish, and do give you my hearty thanks for what you have discours'd to me of the many <HI>Inter|pretations</HI> relating to the <HI>Oath,</HI> and the rendring them so consistent with it, and by means whereof <HI>I</HI> am sensible that the <HI>Oath</HI> hath become more then <HI>res unius oetatis,</HI> and that without them it would not have been so much: and by which both the <HI>credit</HI> of the <HI>Oath,</HI> and the quiet of the Consciences of the Takers of it have been preserv'd. And <HI>I</HI> am glad that the task of <HI>enumerating</HI> them all hath happen'd thus to fall into your hands, and that
<PB N="137" REF="72" MS="y">
therein you have not (as they say of young <HI>Conjurers</HI> raising <HI>Spirits</HI> that they cannot <HI>lay</HI>) occasion'd any doubts in me about the Oath but what you have fairly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> and fully satisfy'd.

Throwing therefore by, any <HI>Thoughts</HI> and <HI>Expressions</HI> of mine of that <HI>nature</HI> which you censured as <HI>airy</HI> (and as to which I submit to your reproof) I shall prepare my mind with a decent temper both of <HI>delight</HI> and Pious <HI>dread</HI> to contemplate my <HI>Oath</HI> as now set before me, and as containing in it that <HI>clearness,</HI> and that <HI>Majesty</HI> that may excite both those Passions in me, and the <HI>real</HI> view of which I may some way compare to that in vision, <HI>Ezekiel's terrible crystal.</HI></P>

<P>Long may you live in this temper. I remember I have somewhere read it, that the <HI>Oath</HI> by which the <HI>Cardinals</HI> are bound to the <HI>maintenance</HI> of the Church-Privileges is drawn in such clear and powerful words, that <HI>Baronius</HI> calls it <HI>terribile Iuramentum,</HI> and saith, that <HI>the only remembring of it inflicts a horror upon his Mind, and a trembling upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> Body.</HI> And I doubt not but when I shall at our next meeting discourse with you about our obligation from the <HI>Promissory</HI> part of the <HI>Oath</HI> that relates to the <HI>assi|stance</HI> and <HI>defence</HI> of the <HI>Regal</HI> Rights and <HI>Privileges,</HI> you will think that every <HI>Taker</HI> of it, ought to have some such sense of his remembring it, as <HI>Baronius</HI> had about his <HI>terrible</HI> Oath.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>But to go on according to the freedom you gave me, I remember you told me that you would not trouble me with any <HI>Notions</HI> or <HI>Moot Points</HI> about the Power of <HI>Interpreting</HI> Acts of <HI>Parliament,</HI> and about which you cited Sir <HI>Christopher Hatton</HI>'s Book <HI>Of Acts of Parliament and their Expo|sition:</HI> but I remember you have <HI>Sparsim</HI> variously spoke of it, and you mention'd to me what King <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>First</HI> told both Houses shortly af|ter the granting the <HI>Petition of Right,</HI> that <HI>to the Iudges only under him the Interpretation of the Laws belong'd, and that none of the Houses of Parlia|ment, joint or separate either could make or declare a Law without his Consent.</HI> I suppose you intend here to lodge no <HI>Snake</HI> in the <HI>grass</HI> of this <HI>Regal</HI> Power of interpretation, whereby we may be <HI>interpreted</HI> out of our <HI>Magna Charta</HI> and the <HI>Petition</HI> of <HI>Right,</HI> and out of our <HI>Religion,</HI> or <HI>Property.</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your <HI>Supposal</HI> doth but right to my intentions. I have referr'd you only to <HI>Facts,</HI> and leave you to make a <HI>due</HI> use of them, and shall when we meet again shew you further why <HI>I</HI> have thus referr'd you to these <HI>Facts</HI> of the <HI>Regal</HI> interpretation: And in the mean time you may take notice, that as to what <HI>I</HI> have mentioned as a <HI>Notion</HI> out of the Lord Chancellor <HI>Hatton,</HI> (of which the intent and substance was, <HI>That if all the Parliament were voluntarily assembled again and not by Writ, Eorum non esset interpre|tari dubium Statutum,</HI> as the words are in the <HI>Table</HI> of his <HI>Book,</HI> Chap. 4&punc; and with which the <HI>Chapter</HI> agrees) I told you I would not <HI>trouble</HI> you with it, and you may give it its <HI>transeat</HI> as a kind of curious <HI>impossible</HI> Case. Nor need you <HI>amuse</HI> your self about any Consequences by me meant in what I told you of King <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>First,</HI> telling the three Estates as they were <HI>feasting</HI> themselves with the noble <HI>Concessions</HI> of the <HI>Petition of Right.</HI> I know nothing asserted by my Lord <HI>Coke</HI> in <HI>Inst.</HI> 4&punc; <HI>Chap.</HI> 1. <HI>Of the High and Honourable Court of Parliament,</HI> but wherein I own my agreeing with him, and particularly as to what he speaks <HI>of Iudicature.</HI> And I doubt not but every one accounts that what he said <HI>Inst.</HI> 3. c. 73. was very <HI>Orthodox,</HI> viz. <HI>NOTE, Proclamations are of great force, which are grounded upon the Laws of the Realm.</HI> Nor considering the <HI>exuberance</HI> of that great thing call'd <HI>bona fides</HI> that is to be expected from Princes, need any man fear that there
<PB N="138" REF="73">
will be an Exposition of <HI>abrogamus</HI> for <HI>statuimus</HI> in any of the <HI>Declaratory</HI> Proclamations that ours shall make.</P>
<P>But because you have named <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> and <HI>the Petition of Right,</HI> I shall take occasion to <HI>cite</HI> to you a very <HI>popular</HI> Authority to shew you that any <HI>Proclamations</HI> our <HI>English</HI> Monarchs shall make for the <HI>Dispensing</HI> with <HI>Penal</HI> Religionary <HI>Laws,</HI> will be but <HI>Declaratory</HI> of <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> and of the <HI>Petition</HI> of <HI>Right.</HI> You know we have often spoke of the <HI>Arguments</HI> in the <HI>Parliament</HI> of 40. made by Mr. <HI>Bagshaw,</HI> who was <HI>Pars magna</HI> of the <HI>Faction</HI> then regnant, and by which those <HI>Arguments</HI> of his were much celebrated. You may find some account of his <HI>Character</HI> in <HI>Heylin</HI>'s History of Arch|bishop <HI>Laud,</HI> who mentions his being chosen <HI>Reader</HI> for the <HI>Lent Vacation</HI> by the <HI>Middle-Temple</HI> in the year 1639. And he in his <HI>First Argument,</HI> viz. <HI>Concerning the Canons,</HI> p. 11. saith, <HI>Liberty of Religion and Conscience are (as I take it) within the words of MAGNA CHARTA granted to me as mine Inheritance,</HI> Cap. 29. <HI>Nullus liber homo imprisonetur <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ut disseisetur de libertatibus vel liberis Consuetudinibus suis. <HI>And Liberty of Con|science is the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">test Liberty. It is by a necessary Consequence and deduction within the words</HI></HI> imprisonetur. <HI>For put the Case that the Clergy make Ca|nons to which I never assented, and I break these Canons, whereupon I am Ex|communicated, and upon a</HI> Significavit <HI>by the Bishop, my Body is taken and imprison'd by a Writ</HI> de excommunicato Capiendo, <HI>now shall I lie in Prison all the days of my life, and shall never be deliver'd by a</HI> Cautione admittenda, <HI>unless I will come in and</HI> parere mandatis Ecclesiae, <HI>which are point blank against my Conscience.</HI> And he had before said, <HI>A Comparatis: by an Argu|ment</HI> &agrave; minori ad majus; <HI>if Property of Goods cannot be taken from me with|out my assent in Parliament, which is the fundamental Law of the Land, and so declared in the Petition of Right, why then Property and Liberty of Con|science which is much greater, as much as</HI> bona animi <HI>are above</HI> bona fortunae, <HI>cannot be taken from me without my assent.</HI></P>
<P>This it seems pass'd as <HI>Currant</HI> Coin for <HI>Iudgment</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> in behalf of <HI>Liberty</HI> of <HI>Conscience,</HI> in the <HI>Conjuncture</HI> of 41, the <HI>year</HI> in which his <HI>Book</HI> was Printed: and if it were so then allowable, you may well think that a <HI>Prince</HI>'s owning the Religion that flourish'd here in the time of <HI>Magna char|ta</HI> (and which inspired the Virtue that produced <HI>Magna Charta</HI>) and indulg|ing some others of the same Religion to profess it without Punishment, is not likely to occasion any <HI>durable</HI> ferment.</P>
<P>And what <HI>I</HI> have here referr'd to concerning <HI>the Petition of Right,</HI> minds me of the great <HI>effort</HI> of Pious zeal in our famous Bishop <HI>Hall,</HI> and his laudably making use of the <HI>Popularity</HI> he had among the <HI>Protestants</HI> in send|ing a <HI>Letter</HI> to the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Commons, April</HI> the 28th, 1628. during the great <HI>ferment</HI> about that Petition, and in which he gives so much <HI>fatherly</HI> and Prudent <HI>advice</HI> to the great <HI>Agonists</HI> for <HI>Property,</HI> that they should consider when they were at the end of their <HI>race,</HI> and then to sit down and rest. He hath in it these <HI>tender</HI> Expressions, <HI>Gentlemen, For God's sake be wise in your well-meant zeal,</HI> and <HI>our Liberties and Proprieties are sufficient|ly declared to be sure and legal,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>let us not in suspicion of Evils that may be cast our selves into present confusion. If you love your selves and your Country, remit something of your own terms. And since the Substance is yielded by your noble Patriots, stand not too rigorously upon Points of Circumstance. Pear not to trust a good King, who after the strict Laws made, must be trusted with the Execution,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>relent or farewel welfare.</HI></P>
<P>You may hence easily imagine how passionately that good Bishop would have been concerned if he had then seen among the <HI>Patriots</HI> any unquench|able heats about the not <HI>trusting</HI> the <HI>King</HI> with the <HI>Executive</HI> Power of
<PB N="139" REF="73">
<HI>Penal</HI> Laws, and <HI>Laws in terrorem,</HI> and such <HI>Laws</HI> as Mr. <HI>Glanvil</HI> in the '<HI>Month</HI> after the <HI>Date</HI> of the Bishop's Letter, said in a full <HI>Committee</HI> of both Houses, <HI>That the Commons must and ever will acknowledge that it is in His Majesty's ABSOLUTE and undoubted Power to grant Dispensations in,</HI> as I told you.</P>
<P>In God's Name, often think of that great <HI>Patriotly</HI> saying of <HI>Tully</HI> so often with just Applause cited by <HI>Sir</HI> E. Coke, <HI>Major haereditas venit uni|cuique nostrum &agrave; jure &amp; legibus quam &agrave; parentibus:</HI> and you may account him a <HI>Prophane</HI> Person who <HI>despiseth his Birth-right</HI> given him by the <HI>Law.</HI> And pity any one who speaking of his <HI>Property,</HI> doth not know this to be the meaning of it, namely that <HI>it is the highest Right he hath or can have to any thing, and which is no way depending upon another man's Court<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e.</HI> And consider, that as you have a <HI>Property</HI> in your <HI>Chattels</HI> and <HI>Heredita|ments,</HI> so you have in your <HI>Religion.</HI></P>
<P>Think often with honour of our <HI>Ancestors,</HI> who by so many <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Par|liament,</HI> and lawful <HI>Canons</HI> and <HI>Constitutions</HI> since the <HI>Refo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">mation,</HI> provided for the securing your <HI>Property</HI> in your <HI>Religion;</HI> and remember how bind|ing the very <HI>declarative</HI> Laws about it are.</P>
<P>Cast your Eye with Pleasure about the Realm, and see if you can find any one who fears that any one will ever <HI>move</HI> in <HI>Parliament</HI> for <HI>leave</HI> to <HI>bring</HI> in any <HI>Bill</HI> to take away the least part of your <HI>Property</HI> in your <HI>Reli|gion.</HI> But then consider how Savage a thing it is in any to take excessive <HI>delight</HI> in the Execution of <HI>Penal</HI> Laws. <HI>Ferus est qui fruitur paen&acirc;:</HI> and remember too that your <HI>Prince</HI> hath a <HI>Property</HI> in the <HI>Executive</HI> part of the <HI>Law,</HI> and in <HI>distributive</HI> Justice and in shewing <HI>Mercy.</HI> And when you hear any one telling you of a <HI>Snake in the grass</HI> of the Prince's dispensing with <HI>Penal</HI> Laws, and that therefore there may be <HI>danger</HI> of your Prince's <HI>dispen|sing</HI> in <HI>Laws</HI> that are <HI>leneficial;</HI> you may tell him of the notorious <HI>Non-sequi|tur,</HI> and that you have a <HI>Property</HI> in not being punish'd, and in having the benefit of the <HI>Rule</HI> as to <HI>favourable</HI> Statutes, being made more so by inter|pretation: <HI>Favores sunt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">mpliandi,</HI> and on the contrary as to <HI>Penal</HI> ones that <HI>odiosa restringi convenit.</HI> And so to any such impertinent Objecter you may say that the <HI>voice</HI> or <HI>sound</HI> of his <HI>Snake,</HI> and the <HI>Goose</HI> are all one.</P>
<P>But consider that since you have so much cause to depend on the glorious and <HI>consummate</HI> justice inherent in the nature of our great Monarch for his defending you in the security of all the <HI>Declaratory</HI> Acts of <HI>Parliament</HI> that maintain your very Property in your Religion; both <HI>Iustice</HI> and Common <HI>Ingenuity</HI> call upon you to own his Power of <HI>Dispensing</HI> (and even with <HI>disa|bility</HI>) for which I have shewn you so many <HI>clear</HI> and <HI>incontestable</HI> decla|rative <HI>Iudgments</HI> of <HI>Parliament,</HI> and shall direct you to more when we meet again.</P>
<P>And let me tell you that you ought to have the greater <HI>tenderness</HI> for this <HI>Prerogative</HI> of our <HI>Prince;</HI> for that in his <HI>Administration</HI> of it, he hath in some Points shewn a greater <HI>tenderness</HI> to his <HI>Laws</HI> and People then our Princes since the Reformation have done. You may remember I shew'd you how Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and King <HI>Iames</HI> did by their <HI>Authority</HI> out of <HI>Parliament MAKE</HI> things <HI>Penal</HI> by <HI>Disability</HI> that were not so by any Law in being, and therefore you may the less wonder when you see your Prince <HI>dispensing</HI> with it, and thereby <HI>preventing</HI> the Punishment of it, and sometimes and in some Cases <HI>pardoning</HI> it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall carefully take notice of all these Matters wherein you have cau|tion'd me: but am here occasionally on the account of some things you said about the <HI>Interpretation</HI> and the <HI>Acquittal</HI> from Penalties in the <HI>Queen's Admonition</HI> being <HI>perpetuated</HI> by their being <HI>declared</HI> good in <HI>Parliament,</HI>
<PB N="140" REF="74">
to ask you if you do not account that <HI>Dispensations</HI> or such <HI>Interpretations</HI> of the Prince by his own single Authority, may be made to continue good in following Reigns?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not in the least doubt but they may; and I shall hereafter evince the thing to you: but shall at present out of a <HI>Manuscript Report</HI> I have of the great <HI>Case</HI> of <HI>Thomas</HI> and <HI>Sorrell,</HI> tell you that by one of the great Coun|cel who argued in <HI>it,</HI> it was <HI>asserted</HI> with great Learning, <HI>That the</HI> Non|obstante <HI>in that Case remain'd good after the King's death. That tho Acts the King doth in his Natural Capacity determine by his death, as making of Iudges,</HI> &amp;c. (<HI>for those referr to his Natural Will) yet things done in his Royal Capacity as King, do not determine by his death: as a License to alien in Mort|m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">in&punc; in one King's time serves in anothers; and the Reason is when the Subject is once exempt out of the Restraint of the Act he is ever exempt, unless the Ex|emption be limited,</HI> Coke 1. Inst. 52. 6. <HI>If the Lessor licence his Lessee that is restrain'd, by Condition not to Alien, tho the Lessor die, the licence shall serve the Lessee to alien, and is not determin'd by the Lessor's death. And in this Point he cited</HI> Trin. 2. Jac. C. B. Rot. 2835. Wright <HI>vers&ugrave;s</HI> Radcliffe, <HI>and</HI> Trin. 2. Jac. Norris <HI>v.</HI> Mason. C. B. <HI>as Cases adjudged in this point.</HI></P>
<P>And I shall then shew you how the same thing was then by others asserted: but you may now for this purpose remember how the <HI>instances</HI> I have given you of Queen <HI>Elizabeth's</HI> Parliaments <HI>approving</HI> and <HI>declaring</HI> to be good, what she did of this kind, and the <HI>instances</HI> of what others of our <HI>Princes</HI> did by their own <HI>Authority</HI> and out of <HI>Parliament</HI> being valid, and being afterward approved in Parliament, have supported the <HI>extent</HI> of the Regal Authority of this kind, as to point of <HI>time.</HI></P>
<P>But because according to the <HI>Rule</HI> of <HI>Unumquodque dissolvitur eo modo quo colligatur,</HI> many <HI>Indulgences,</HI> and <HI>Injunctions</HI> and <HI>Dispensations</HI> being <HI>revocable</HI> by Kings themselves and by their <HI>Successors,</HI> and because <HI>declara|tory</HI> Acts of <HI>Parliament</HI> cannot be <HI>repeal</HI>'d but by other <HI>Acts,</HI> common Pru|dence doth suggest it to all to endeavour the <HI>perpetuating</HI> to themselves by the <HI>Legislative</HI> Power what they account beneficial. And if you will, you may use the term of having it <HI>confirm'd</HI> by that Power; that is, if you will allow it to have been <HI>firm before,</HI> you may call it <HI>confirm'd</HI> by the Prince, and the three Estates afterward <HI>enacting</HI> it, and making its <HI>firmness</HI> perpetual. And this is the thing I aim'd at in what you might take for a <HI>Criticism</HI> when I said, <HI>that the</HI> 39 <HI>Articles owed no Confirmation nor Authority to the Act of the 13th of</HI> Eliz.</P>

You accounting even every <HI>Declaratory</HI> Judgment of <HI>Parliament</HI> for our <HI>Religion</HI> to be a <HI>Treasure,</HI> and having often said that you would al|low some <HI>Roman-Catholicks</HI> to mock on in calling our <HI>Religion</HI> a <HI>Parliamen|tary</HI> Religion, did (I judge) design to do <HI>honour</HI> to our <HI>Religion</HI> as well as to our <HI>Prince's,</HI> in shewing that it was here <HI>orderly</HI> establish'd by God's <HI>Vicegerents,</HI> before it was by the <HI>Deputies</HI> of the <HI>People,</HI> or the <HI>Mag|nates Regni.</HI></P>

<P>You guess right at my meaning in this way to salve <HI>Phaenomena.</HI> And if you will look on a <HI>Book</HI> Printed in <HI>Oxford,</HI> A. 1645. entituled <HI>Parlia|ments Power in Laws for Religion, or an Answer to that old and groundless Calumny of the Papists nick-naming the Religion of the Church of</HI> England <HI>by the name of a Parliamentary Religion,</HI> &amp;c. you will find the <HI>Fact</HI> in this Point clearly deduced through the course of our Laws and Constitutions in a long <HI>series temporum</HI> from the Reign of <HI>Harry</HI> the <HI>8th</HI> downward, and for the <HI>honour</HI> of our <HI>Kings</HI> and of the <HI>Church</HI> and the Reformation; and the measures I have taken in our discourse have been suitable to those of the judicious and learned <HI>Author</HI> of that Book.</P>

<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well Sir: we have had a great deal of <HI>frank</HI> Discourse, and I will now take the freedom to put one <HI>Question</HI> more to you. You have entertain'd me with the several <HI>Interpretations</HI> of our <HI>Oath,</HI> and have shew'd me how the obligatoriness of them all hath been perpetuated: and you have like|wise&punc; <HI>salved</HI> the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> in the <HI>Iustice</HI> of the <HI>Government</HI> as to the Laws <HI>in terrorem.</HI> But you know the Story of one who being Lord of a place did leave a <HI>Pit</HI> long open too near the <HI>High-way,</HI> and who at Night erected Lights about it to prevent its being mischievous: and he afterward, hear|ing that sometimes poor Blind men who were Travellers fell into it and that at other times by various accidents the <HI>Lights</HI> were not helpful to other Passengers, as being took away, or going out too soon; and he therefore at last very fairly removed both his <HI>Nuisance</HI> and <HI>Lights</HI> together. And now may it hot be wish'd that the <HI>Prince</HI> and the three Estates would <HI>remove</HI> the Laws about our <HI>Oaths</HI> and the <HI>Interpretations</HI> too, and so likewise all the Laws <HI>in terrorem,</HI> (among which <HI>I</HI> suppose you reckon the <HI>Test-Acts</HI>) at which so many have taken <HI>offence?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may easily guess that till we have both of us at another meeting discours'd of the <HI>Obligation</HI> resulting from the <HI>Promissory</HI> part of the <HI>Oath,</HI> I will not engage your thoughts in any matter of <HI>Controverfie</HI> that may in the least perplex them. But as soon as we have fully discours'd that, I shall frankly give you my thoughts at large relating to the question about <HI>Repealing</HI> of the <HI>Test-Acts</HI> in a Parliamentary manner: but do at present wholly forbear to mention what I think thereof. And I have before told you my judg|ment of the likelihood of the continuance of our great Oath as a great <HI>lu|minary</HI> that may perhaps enlighten our <HI>English</HI> World in the measures of <HI>Loyalty</HI> to the end of time; and as I have told you the Oath <HI>giveth</HI> no <HI>offence</HI> to the Considerate, so I will hope none will be taken at it.</P>
<P>But <HI>I</HI> must here tell you, that <HI>I</HI> have a greater veneration for the <HI>Oath,</HI> because <HI>I</HI> look on the serious <HI>Consideration</HI> of the <HI>assertory</HI> part of it as likely to be very <HI>Instrumental</HI> in allaying the ferment we have been speaking of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>God grant it may be so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>You remember what <HI>I</HI> hinted to you about the <HI>Clause</HI> whereby you <HI>testify'd and declared that the King is the only Supreme Governor of this Realm as well in all Spiritual or Ecclesiastical things or Causes as Temporal,</HI> (and from whence it follow'd by way of natural Consequence, that <HI>no foreign Prince,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>hath any Iurisdiction within this Realm)</HI> being the <HI>Corner-stone</HI> on which the great <HI>And therefore, <HI>I</HI></HI> mean, <HI>your for|saking foreign Iurisdiction</HI> was built. And <HI>I</HI> assure you that the same <HI>first <HI>Declaration</HI></HI> doth bind you to the like AND THEREFORE to <HI>renounce</HI> the belief of any <HI>Power</HI> on <HI>Earth</HI> being able to <HI>dissolve</HI> your King's <HI>right</HI> of <HI>Commanding</HI> your Obedience, and your <HI>Obligation</HI> to <HI>obey</HI> him.</P>
<P>And indeed if <HI>I</HI> had produced to you no <HI>Iudgment</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> for the purpose <HI>I</HI> have done but that which is contain'd in the <HI>assertory</HI> part of the <HI>Oath,</HI> (and which is unanimously interpreted by <HI>Divines</HI> and <HI>Lawyers,</HI> as expressive of the King's right <HI>jure naturae</HI> to <HI>Command</HI> the <HI>Obedience</HI> of <HI>all</HI> his Subjects) it might have sufficiently satisfy'd you therein: and if at our next meeting you will have me dilate more on what our Lawyers have said about the Point of the debt of our <HI>Natural</HI> allegiance, <HI>I</HI> shall do it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our great Lawyers Judgments in that Point being known may be variously useful, and directive to the many illiterate and presumptuous Re|flecters on the exercise of Prerogative; and especially if so learned and so <HI>po|pular</HI> a <HI>Lawyer</HI> as Sir <HI>Edward Coke</HI> shall be by you further cited in such a Case. And so what you shall acquaint me with as from any such one of them shall be kindly welcome.</P>

<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>What you have now said brings it into my mind how that Great <HI>po|pular</HI> Man Sir <HI>Edward Coke</HI> was cited for this purpose by that great <HI>popular</HI> Man Sir <HI>William Iones</HI> in his learned <HI>Argument</HI> in <HI>Thomas &amp; Dorcel's Case,</HI> and where he did so much right to the <HI>DISPENSATIVE</HI> Power.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>What? Did Sir <HI>William Iones</HI> maintain the <HI>King's</HI> Power of <HI>Dispen|sing</HI> with <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Parliament?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and (<HI>I</HI> believe) was never censured for so doing by any one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I</HI> pray tell me what was said by him in his <HI>Argument.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then according to the very Learned and Judicious and Candid <HI>Manu|script Report</HI> I have of the Case, thus it was, <HI>Among the three Points made, the first being if the</HI> Non-obstante <HI>in the Patent of King</HI> James <HI>was good against the Statute of</HI> Edw. 6. Jones <HI>agreed that the King may by</HI> Non-obstante <HI>dispense with a thing Prohibited by Statute if the thing were lawful before the Statute were made.</HI> And he afterward said, that <HI>a Dispensation to one and his Heirs was never good but only in that of a Sheriff.</HI> 2. H. 7. 6. <HI>Grant of a Shrievalty in fee</HI> Non-obstante <HI>the Statute. But</HI> Coke 7. R. 14. <HI>Calvin's Case; the Reason of that is because the King hath interest to have the Service of all his Subjects by the Law of Nature.</HI></P>
<P>And the truth is, that on this noble and great Consideration it is that our <HI>Divines</HI> who have <HI>treated</HI> of the <HI>OATH</HI> of <HI>SUPREMACY</HI> have fix'd the reasonableness and intent of that Oath, and of the <HI>King</HI>'s having a <HI>right</HI> to Command the <HI>Obedience</HI> of <HI>all</HI> his Subjects, upon the <HI>basis</HI> of the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> as well as on the Divine Law <HI>Positive.</HI> And thus too the <HI>style</HI> of the <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> about the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Allegiance</HI> runs, and which <HI>Acts</HI> you may Consult if you want any more <HI>Iudgments</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> about the <HI>indissolubility</HI> of the King's right to Command the <HI>Obedience</HI> of the Sub|ject, and of the Subjects duty to <HI>obey,</HI> before we meet again. The reasona|bleness of the words in that <HI>Oath</HI> contain'd in the <HI>Statute</HI> of 3^t^i^o. <HI>Iacobi,</HI> viz. Of <HI>declaring that the Pope hath no Power to discharge any of his Ma|jesty's Subjects of their Obedience,</HI> appears from its being call'd in that <HI>Statute <HI>their Natural Obedience.</HI></HI> And <HI>the putting in Practice the per|swading or withdrawing any of the King's Subjects from their Natural Obedience to his Majesty, or to reconcile them to the Pope or See of Rome</HI> is there made <HI>Treason.</HI> We will speak more of other <HI>Statutes</HI> of this nature at our next meeting.</P>
<P>And in the mean time let me observe to you how as in the <HI>Conjuncture</HI> of the <HI>Exclusion</HI> so many were <HI>infatuated</HI> as for fear of <HI>Popery</HI> to come, to run upon the very <HI>Court of Rome-Popery</HI> at present, namely that of <HI>Domi|nium fundatur in Grati&acirc;,</HI> so likewise many mens fear of the belief of per|haps some Religionary <HI>Tenets</HI> of <HI>Popery</HI> gaining ground for the future, hath hunted them upon the <HI>Popery</HI> of thinking <HI>that Subjects CAN in part, or in whole be discharged from their Natural Obedience to their Prince.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I</HI> thank you <HI>Sir,</HI> for suggesting that to me: for the truth is the <HI>tenet</HI> of thinking it lawful so to <HI>discharge</HI> Subjects from such their <HI>Natural Obe|dience,</HI> is the very <HI>odiosa materia</HI> charged by so many on the <HI>Councel</HI> of <HI>Lateran.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>You say right. But however let me occasionally advise you not to charge the <HI>odious</HI> matter in that <HI>Councel</HI> on the Communion of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome.</HI> For <HI>I</HI> shall tell you that the great <HI>Writers</HI> of our <HI>Church</HI> did after the <HI>real</HI> Plot of the <HI>Gun-Powder-Treason</HI> pursue such noble <HI>Methods</HI> of Christian <HI>Charity,</HI> as with an intent of improving the Principles of Loyalty and Allegiance among all our <HI>Roman-Catholick</HI> Countrymen, to endeavour to prove with all their Learning that the <HI>Decrees</HI> of that <HI>Coun|cel</HI> obliged no <HI>Papist</HI> in point of Conscience. King <HI>Iames</HI> in his Works
<PB N="143" REF="75" MS="y">
calls it but <HI>a Pretended Councel,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Donne</HI> in his <HI>Pseudo-Martyr</HI> endea|vours to prove it no <HI>Councel.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover Bishop <HI>Bilson</HI> in his learned Works for maintaining the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Supremacy,</HI> saith that <HI>Nothing was Concluded in the Councel of</HI> Lateran. <HI>I</HI> have here on the Table his <HI>Book</HI> call'd, <HI>The Difference between Christian Subjection, and Un-christian Rebellion,</HI> Printed <HI>A.</HI> 1586, in which his <HI>Learned</HI> and <HI>Iudicious</HI> Assertions and Explications of the Regal <HI>Supremacy,</HI> and of our Moral <HI>Offices</HI> to <HI>defend</HI> the same are comprised: and there in <HI>Part</HI> 3. p. 6. you will find what he saith of the <HI>Lateran</HI> Councel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I</HI> have not the <HI>Book,</HI> and shall be glad <HI>I</HI> may borrow it from you, that thereby <HI>I</HI> may have the better prospect of the <HI>Measures</HI> of our <HI>Divines</HI> in their <HI>Sense</HI> of the <HI>Assertory</HI> part of the <HI>Oath of Supremacy,</HI> as making the <HI>Rights</HI> of our Kings to Command the <HI>Services</HI> of all their <HI>Subjects,</HI> to be indissoluble.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I</HI> pray take it along with you. And <HI>I</HI> am the rather desirous you should do it, because in this <HI>Crooked and Perverse Generation</HI> many who <HI>strain</HI> their <HI>Consciences</HI> by the inobservance of the <HI>Oath,</HI> may be so vain as to fancy that others strain the <HI>Oath</HI> who endeavour (as <HI>I</HI> have done) to build the <HI>Right</HI> of our Kings to Command the <HI>Services</HI> of their Subjects, on its so firm Foundation. He was trusted by the Government to write on the Subject of the <HI>Oath,</HI> and so his Authority is of the more weight: and <HI>I</HI> shall here at parting read to you what he saith in <HI>Part</HI> 2. <HI>p.</HI> 183. where he so well insinuates it, <HI>that the Prince can freely permit, safely de|fend, generally restrain, and externally punish within the Realm:</HI> but in <HI>p.</HI> 328. having spoke of the true <HI>Supremacy of Princes,</HI> he saith, <HI>This is the Supre|macy which we attribute to Princes, that all Men within their Territories should obey their Laws, or abide their Pleasures, and that no man on Earth hath Authority to take their Swords from them by Iudicial Sentence, or Mar|tial Violence.</HI> And he there had before said in his Margin, <HI>the Sword of Princes is Supreme, in that it is not Subject to the Pope; and must be obey'd of all in things that are good.</HI> What he saith likewise in <HI>p.</HI> 346. there is worth your reading, where he makes the word <HI>Supreme</HI> to be <HI>a plain and manifest deduction out of the 13th of the</HI> Romans, <HI>Let every Soul be subject to the Superior Powers. If all Men must be subject to them,</HI> ergo <HI>they are Supe|rior to all: and Superior to all is Supreme.</HI> He then thus goeth on in his <HI>Dialogue-way,</HI> Phil&punc; <HI>S.</HI> Paul <HI>maketh them Superiors over all Persons, but not over all things.</HI> Theop. <HI>That Distinction is ours,</HI> (meaning Protestants) <HI>not yours: we did ever interpret Supreme for Superior to all men within their Dominions.</HI> Phil. <HI>And so we grant them to be but not in all things. For in Temporal things they are Superior to all men, in Spiritual they are not.</HI> Theop. <HI>That restraint comes too late: the Holy Ghost charging you to be subject to them simply without addition. It passeth your reach to limit in what things you will, and in what things you will not be subject.</HI> And he there saith, <HI>Out of all Question where Princes may by God's Law Command, all men must obey them not only for fear of wrath, but for Conscience sake.</HI> To this purpose too he <HI>asserts</HI> the <HI>Supremacy</HI> in the following <HI>Page: All men are bound to be subject to the Sword in all things, be they Temporal or Spiritual, not only by Suffering, but also by Obeying: but with this Caution, that in things that are good and agreeable to the Law of God, the Sword must be obey'd, in things that are otherwise, it must be endured.</HI> At the same rate you will find him writing in his <HI>Third Part,</HI> p. 7. <HI>The Word of God bindeth you to obey Princes, the words of men cannot loose you.</HI> But if you will there take notice of the <HI>fire</HI> of his <HI>Zeal</HI> breaking into a <HI>flame</HI> at the thoughts of the <HI>displacing of Princes from their Thrones,</HI> and of the <HI>dis|charging</HI>
<PB N="144" REF="76">
<HI>of the People from the Oath and Obedience toward Princes,</HI> he saith that <HI>they who will go to that, turn Religion into Rebellion, Patience into Vio|lence, Words into Weapons, Preaching into Fighting, Fidelity into Perjury, Subjection into Sedition, and instead of the Servants of God, which they might be by enduring, they become the Soldiers of Satan by resisting the Powers which God hath ordain'd.</HI></P>
