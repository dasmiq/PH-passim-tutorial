that the ministers of Goddes

for they are necessarye instru|mentes
vnto the health of men

Therefore maye it be conclu|ded
that the absolucion of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">i. Timo. v.</NOTE>

seynge it is none other thynge,

of heaue~, that whatsoeuer

whatsoeuer thei bynde in earth
maye also be bounde in heaue~,
<PB REF="39">
that is to saye: he hath commit|ted
to theim the office of prea|chyng
the Gospel, y^t they should
go forth into the worlde, &amp; prea+che
vnto all men the grace and
fauoure that is geuen of God
the father for Christes sake, yea
and that thei should proclaime,
publish and set abrode vnto all
men, that so many as repent &amp;
beleue, are losoned fro~ the cap|tiuitie
of satha~, purged fro~ syn,
deliuered fro~ death, &amp; made en|heritours
of eternal life: Again
that so many as beleue not, re|mayne
still y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> captiues &amp; bonde
s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">aues of sata~, &amp; co~tinew bou~de
in their synnes, and in the state
of damnacion, and that there|fore
thei shal dye the death, and
for euer more be damned, ex|cepte
they repent, turne and

is so certeyn and sure
<PB REF="39">
before God, that whatsoeuer
they pronounce, beynge con|formable
to the worde of God,
shall as certenly come to passe,
as thoughe God hym selfe had
spoken it. As for an example,
Whan soeuer the ministers &amp;
preachers of Gods woorde in
this worlde shall declare to the
faythfull repentaunce, remis|sion
of synnes, &amp; tell them that
they be losoned fro~ y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> captiuitie
of satha~, it is euen as certen &amp;
sure, as though God hym selfe
had sayde these woordes vnto
them: Thy synnes are forgeue~
the. In lyke manner whan
they shall saye to the vnfayth|full,
that they remayne still
bou~de in their synne, and that
the wrathe of God abydeth
vpon them, and therefore they
shall be damned, God appro|approueth
<PB REF="40">
their sayinge, and it
shal vndoubtedly come to passe
according to their preachinge.
So that whatsoeuer the mini|ster
of Gods worde sayeth, ac|cordynge
to the worde of God,
ought to be receyued w^t greate
reuerence, and take~ as an ora|ele,
sent doune from heauen, &amp;
vndoubtedly beleued, as a ma|nifeste
and infallible veritie
of God. And this preaching of
remittyng or retaynyng sinnes
are the keyes of the kyngdome
of heauen, which Christ promy|sed
his Apostles before hys
death, as we maye se in Mat|thew,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. xvi.</NOTE>
and after hys resurrectio~
performed hys promyse, as we
rede in the Gospel of saint Io|han.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioan. xx.</NOTE>
And by a Metaphore
Christ calleth the preachyng of
his worde a keye. For as a keye
hath twoo properties, one too
<PB REF="40">
shutte, another to open, so hath
the worde of God. It openeth
to the faythfull the treasure of
the giftes of God, grace, mercy,
fauou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e, remission of synnes,
quietnes of conscience, &amp; euer|lastyng
life, but to the vnfaith|full
it shutteth all his treasu|res,
and suffereth the~, to receiue
none of them all, so lo~g as they
persiste and remayne in theyr
incredulity and vnfaithfulnes.
These keyes are geuen too so
many, as beynge truely called
vnto the office of ministracion,
preache y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> worde of God. They
loosen, that is to say, they prea|che
to the faythfull remissio~ of
synnes by Christe. They also
bynde, that is, they declare to y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
vnfaythfull damnacion. But
he y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> preacheth not the woorde
of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> can neyther bynde nor
loose, though he chale~ge neuer
<PB REF="41">
so great dignitie, authoritie &amp;
power. For Christ calleth it the
keye of knowlege.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luc. xi.</NOTE> And the Pro+phet
sayth, y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> lyppes of a Priest
kepe knowledge, and at hys
mouthe shall they requyre the
lawe, for he is the Aungell or
messenger of the Lorde of hoo|stes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Malach. ii</NOTE>
Therefore where there is
no k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">wlege, there is no keye.
And where there is no keye,
there is neyther openynge nor
shuttinge, that is, neyther byn|dynge
nor loosonynge. Here
let all menne iudge what is to
be thoughte of the Papistes
absolucion, whereof they crake
so muche, whiche also they sell
derely. If no remission of
synnes cometh from them, but
by preachynge Gods woorde,
it foloweth that their absolu|cion
auayleth but littel, seyng
they neuer preache, neyther the
<PB REF="41">
lawe of God, nor the swete pro|myses
of hym, but onely mum|ble
a fewe woordes in the latin
tonge, yea, and this is not vn|derstanded,
so likewise many ty+mes
contrarye too the diuine
scriptures, and y^e glory of god.
Miserable doub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">les is that co~|gregacion,
which hath a blynd
guyde to their Curate, whiche
hath neyther the gyfte nor the
knowledge of preachynge.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mark. xv.</NOTE> For
if the blynde leadeth the blynd
both falle into y^e dyche. Agayn,
greately fortunate is that Pa|ryshe,
and hyghly blessed of
God, to whome a learned she|peheard
hath chaunced, which
can feede them wyth knowlege
and doctrine. Whatsoeuer
they shall heare of suche a lear|ned
and godly minister, lette
theym beleue it as a voyce co|mynge
doune frome heauen.
<PB REF="42">
And so ofte as by suche a shepe|harde
remission of synnes in y^e
bloude of Christe is preached
vnto the congregation, let the~
esteme that preachinge none o|therwyse,
than if the Lord hym
self had preached it. Let them
stedfastly beleue the woorde of
God, and vndoubtedly by their
fayth th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">row the grace of God,
they shall obtayne remission of
all theyr synnes. Contrariwise,
i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> they beleue not, their synnes
are retayned and by no meanes
forgeuen. These thinges haue
I spoken, concernyng the abs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">cion
or the keyes, which con|sisteth
only in preaching Gods
worde, that the Papistes maye
haue no occasio~, iustly to barke
agaynst me, as they haue done
hytherto both for my sermons
and bkes. God forgeue them,
and sende them a better mynde.
<PB REF="42">
Nowe, forasmuche as the true
and Christen absolution is no|thing
els but the preachinge of
fre deliueraunce from synne, by
y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> death of Iesu Christ, it ought
not to be contemned and despi|sed,
but rather to be receiued w^t
great humilitie and reuerence,
euen as a diuine oracle, sente

For no ma~ ca~ expresse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iaco. i.</NOTE> how
greatly it conforteth infirme &amp;
weake consciences, whiche are
troubled with y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> feare of Gods

Nathan came vnto kyng
Dauid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ii. Reg. xi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters"></NOTE> and rebuked hym for
sleyng Urias the Hethite, &amp; for
taki~g his wyfe Bethsabe vnto

greatly God was angrye with
hym, and what plages shoulde
fall vpon hys house, yea, vpon

<PB REF="43">
is not to be doubted, but that
Dauid was stryken with a wo~|derfull
great heuynes, and his

his faulte, of his wickednes, &amp;
was co~pelled euen of conscie~ce
to braste out into the knowlege
of hys synne, &amp; to saye, I haue
synned agaynst the Lorde. As
Dauid was now full of sorow,
griefe, trouble, disquietnes in
his hert, &amp; had ioye of nothing
(vnto suche shame and confu|sion
was he broughte in hys
conscience) so likewyse it is not
to be doubted, but that he was
wonderfully reuiued, marue|louslye
restored vnto the peace
and quietnes of his conscience,
yea, and plenteously replenis|shed
with ioye in hys mynde,
whan the Prophet sayde these
<PB REF="43">
wordes vnto hym: The Lorde

was a famous synner, &amp; whan
she herde her vnclene conuersa+cion
rebuked by the woorde of

sorow, lamenting greatly, that
she had offended so bounteous

that a large fountayne
