<P>_THough there be nothing more certain, more impartiall, more sudden, then the stroke of Death, yet is there nothing so seldome thought upon, especially of those whose youth and health seem to suppose their graves a great way off. But I may not harbour such a thought of you. The piety of that Family whereof you are very suitable members is a sufficient prohibition. Piou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> hearts are never barren of profitable thoughts: and amongst all those, where|with even a gratious heart doth most abound, none are cer|tainly more advantageous then thoughts of Death; which have ever more thoughts of Repentance, Iudgement, Heaven and Hell for their companions. Yet the best may be bettered: and what I present you with may make your meditations more, and peradventure more usefull then they were be|fore. Some consolations you shall light upon; which is

The po|eme (if it may be called so) is a plain one, because I meant to profit not to puzzle you; and yet it is a poeme, that your profit might come in the pleasingest way. To assure you that the rhythme is no disparagement to the divinity of the matter, were to question your ingenuity, a great part of that wherein you exercise your selves both day and night being written in verse,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Lorin. in Psalmos. Tom.</HI> 1. <HI>p.</HI> 4. D. proveth it by many good wit|nesses.</NOTE> which not|withstanding is the mighty power of God unto salva|tion. If you accept and gain by this poore present, and withall give it leave to wear your names into the world, my ends are accomplished: and your selves (with all that honoured and religious familie) shall be remembred as often as I kneel before the throne of grace. And I will importunately beg of him that sitteth thereon, to in|crease the good gifts and graces of his spirit within you. What if your proficiencie in the wayes of piety be al|ready famous? yet if my prayers find good speed with God, you may sit in glorie a degree the higher. Thus prayeth</P>

<L>What profits pride? Reader, I'll pardon crave</L>

<L>As the Sunne did ever see,</L>
<L>Whom Death robb'd of all her glory.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="10">
<L>I once saw Phoebus in his mid-day sline</L>
<L>Triumphing like the Sovereigne of the skies,</L>
<L>Untill two brighter rayes, both more divine,</L>
<L>Outblazed his: and they were this Nymphs eyes.</L>
<L>Forthwith Sol curtain'd his light,</L>
<L>Looking very red for shame</L>
<L>To be vanquish'd by this Dame,</L>
<L>And did slink out of her sight.</L>

<L>I once saw silver Cynthia, nights fair Queen,</L>
<L>In her full orb dimming each lesser flame,</L>
<L>Till this Nymphs beauty-vying front was seen</L>
<L>Outshining hers: then she look'd wan for shame.</L>
<L>The man in her, knew he how</L>
<L>But to quit that giddy place,</L>
<L>She had so divine a face,</L>
<L>Would have dwelt upon her brow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Once was this woman pleas'd to walk the fields</L>
<L>Then proudly fragrant with Dame Flora's store:</L>
<L>The damask rose unto her beauty yields,</L>
<L>And was contented to be fair no more.</L>
<L>Sure I cannot say how truly,</L>
<L>Yet 'mongst many 't was a fame,</L>
<L>That the rose did blush for shame,</L>
<L>And the violet look'd most bluly.</L>
</LG>

<PB REF="10">
<L>Once did this woman to the temple go,</L>
<L>Where doth fair Venus marble-statue lie</L>
<L>Cut to the life, that one can hardly know</L>
<L>But that it lives indeed: When she came nigh,</L>
<L>He who then the temple kept</L>
<L>After would be often telling</L>
<L>She was so super-excelling</L>
<L>That for mad the marble wept.</L>

<L>Melodious musick's warbled by the spheres;</L>
<L>Swans sing their Epitaphs in curious layes,</L>
<L>Once with a singing Swan a part she bears:</L>

<L>The poore Swan held his peace and di'd:</L>
<L>And the spheres (as men do say)</L>
<L>Dumbly move unto this day.</L>
<L>This was by a rivers side.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What think you now of such a glorious woman?</L>
<L>This Phoenix sure was she, if any might,</L>
<L>That might be proud: And yet the tongue of no man</L>
<L>Can well expresse, nor any pen can write</L>
<L>What grim death hath done unto her;</L>
<L>Now she's of another feature,</L>
<L>Hardly can you know the creature:</L>
<L>Stay a while, and we will view her.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="11">
<L>Th' almighty King that dwells above in heaven</L>

<L>To arrest that piece of beauty</L>
<L>And to wrap her up in clay</L>
<L>'Gainst the last great judgement-day.</L>
<L>Death address'd him to his duty;</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>You would not think with what a furious pace</L>
<L>These catchpoles flie to pull this creature down:</L>
<L>But Pox was nimblest; she got to her face</L>
<L>And plow'd it up. This hag goes in a gown</L>
<L>Rugged and of colour tawny,</L>

<L>As did ever eye look on.</L>
<L>What's become of that complexion</L>
<L>Which held all hearts in subjection?</L>
<L>In a moment all is gone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If we might be so bold to dig the grave</L>
<L>Some few years hence where this good woman lies,</L>
<L>Sure we should find this beauty but a slave</L>
<L>To pallid putrefaction, and a prize</L>
