<HEAD>A DESCRIPTION
OF THE
SQUARE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE whole superficies is divided into
four lesser Squares, by the Diame|ters
FG and HI.</P>
<P>Each of the 4 Semidiameters EF,
EH, EG, EI, are divided as the
lines of Sines upon the Sector, the
Semidiameters being the whole Sine,
And through the parts of each Semi|diameter
are drawn right lines per|pendicular
thereunto, quite over the face of the whole Square
every 10^t^h, 5^t^h, &amp;c. are to be distinguished from the rest, for
the more easie and speedy account.</P>
<P>Upon the limb are inserted several Scales, for several uses.
The edges of these Scales bordering close upon the sides of
the inner Square, that it may be discerned which lines and
parts of the Scales doe butt one upon the other.</P>
<P>On the sides AB, AC, are inscribed Scales of equal
parts, the whole being divided into 10, and subdivided as
quantity will give leave. The parts are numbred by 1. 2. 3. 4.
5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10, and may stand, either for 1. 2. 3, &amp;c. or for
10. 20. 30, &amp;c. or for 100. 200. 300, &amp;c. as occasion re|quireth.</P>
<P>To the lines BI and CG, are annexed Scales of right sines
whose beginning is at B and C, and the end at I and G, num|bred
by 10. 20, &amp;c. to 90.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">
The other parts ID, GD, have Scales of Tangents from
0 gr. to 45 gr. numbred either from G to D, and so to I. Or
from I to D, and so to G, or rather both wayes, by 10, 20,
30, &amp;c. till 90, and these divisions have respect to the Cen|ter
E.</P>
<P>Lastly, a Scale of larger Tangents, lying behind these last
named, Parallel to the sides BD, CD, beginning 0 gr. from B
and C, and so proceeding to 45 gr. in D and ending in 90 gr.
at C and B, accounted both wayes. These have respect to
their Center A.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
<HEAD><GAP DESC="foreign"></HEAD>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>There is further added a threed and plummet, which is to
be used in every practice, and must be in length equal to the
lines AF, and FG. And if the threed be found inconveni|ent
in practice, because it will take up the use of both hands,
there may instead of it, be used a little Bowe, the threed of it
being at the least equal to AD, which will perform the office
of the other threed by the help of one hand only, or a
straight ruler may serve, if it be thought convenient for that
purpose.</P>
<P>If the Square be applyed to the observation of Angles, it
<PB N="5" REF="3">
may be fitted thereto one of these two wayes, <HI>Either by
placing</HI> two sights upon the side of the Square, one upon the
Center A, the other upon the line AB, which issueth out of
the Center A. <HI>And a running sight</HI> contrived upon the utter
edge of the Instrument to move from B to C by D forward,
and so from C to B by D, backward again; <HI>Or else</HI> if this be
thought inconvenient, or not feasible because of the sights turn|ing
over at the Angle D, then this moveable sight may goe
onely upon one of the sides BD or CD. And for that pur|pose
the sight at A, is to stand precisely upon the Center, and
both the sides AB, AG must have sights there fixed, as pre|cisely,
upon their lines that come from A.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>This is the general manner of work for this Proposition,
which may be illustrated by these particulars.</HEAD>
<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>FIRST,</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Having the Latitude of the place, the Declination and
Altitude of the Sun, to find the Hour of the day.</HEAD>
<P>BY the declination of the Sun, may be had his distance from
the elevated Pole, By subtracting it from 90 gr. when the
Declination is of the same denomination with the said
<PB N="6" REF="4">
Pole; Or by adding the Declination to 90 gr. when the De|clination
and elevated Pole are of several denominations.</P>
<P><HI>In this case,</HI> we have the three sides of a Spherical Triangle
given, and an Angle sought.</P>
<P>The two legs are <HI>The complement of the Latitude,</HI> and <HI>The
Suns distance from the Pole.</HI> The base is, <HI>The complement of
the Suns Altitude:</HI> The Angle is the <HI>Hour</HI> required, which
must be accounted from the Coast of a contrary name, to the
elevated Pole.</P>
<P>According then to the former general prescript, and this par|ticular
declaration, <HI>For the hour take the sum and difference
of the complement of the Latitude, and of the Suns distance
from the Pole, and from the top of the Square, upon one side,
count the difference, the sum on the other, to these terms apply
the threed; Then from the top of the Square also, count the com|plement
of the Suns Altitude, and where it cuts the threed, the
line that crosseth it Square in the same point (being reckoned
from that side whereon the difference of the legs was counted)
gives the hour from the Meridian or noon.</HI></P>
<P>To make it plain by an Example.</P>
<P>In a North Latitude of 52 gr. 30 min. the Sun declining
20 gr. to the North, the Altitude of the Sun being by obser|vation
43 gr. I would know the Hour of the day. The legs
of this Triangle are the complements of the latitude and de|clination,
that is 37 gr. 30 min. and 70 gr. 0 min. The sum
of them is 107 gr. 30 min. their difference is 32 gr. 30 min.
Then from the top of the Square at D upon the side DG,
I reckon this difference 32 gr. 30 min. downward to <HI>k.</HI> And
on the other side of the Square from the top at B, I also
count the sum of the legs 107 gr. 30 min. downward to <HI>l.</HI> To
<HI>k</HI> and <HI>l.</HI> I apply the threed. Which done from the top of the
Square, again, I count the base 47 gr. the complement of
43 gr. the altitude observed, downward also to 0, and the line
that there meets me, I follow till it cut the threed, which is
at <HI>n,</HI> and the line that there ariseth Square to it is <HI>n r.
I say now that nr,</HI> if it be counted from the side DC
whereon the difference of the legs was counted, shall give
44gr. 8 min. which turned into hours and minutes of an hour,
(allowing 15 gr. to an hour; and 15 min. of a degree to one
minute of an hour) will make two hours <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nd 56&frac12; min. from
<PB N="7" REF="4">
the Meridian or South, And such is the Hour for that <HI>Latitude,
Altitude,</HI> and <HI>Declination.</HI></P>
<P><HI>So also,</HI> If in the same Latitude and distance of the Sun
from the Pole, but in the altitude of 10 gr. I would know
<HI>The boure of the day.</HI> Here because the legs, that is, the com|plement
of the latitude and the distance from the Pole, are
the same, therefore the same position of the threed remaines
still, I therefore onely reckon the base (as before) which here
is 80 gr. from D to <HI>p,</HI> then I follow the line <HI>p,</HI> till it cuts the
threed at <HI>m,</HI> and the line there arising is <HI>m s,</HI> which counted
from DC, whereon the difference of the legs was reckoned,
shall give 99 gr. 50 min. that is 6 hours 39&frac23; min. of an hour
from the Meridian or South.</P>
<DIV5 TYPE="sub-subsection">
<HEAD>Another Example.</HEAD>
<P><HI>In the same latitude</HI> of 52 gr. 30 min. let the declination of
the Sun be 20 gr. to the South, where his distance from the
elevated Pole is 110 gr. and let the altitude of the Sun be by
observation 10 gr. I require the <HI>Hour.</HI> The legs are 37 gr.
30 min. the complement of the latitude, And 110 gr. the
Suns distance from the Pole. The sum of them is 147 gr.
30 min. The difference 72 gr. 30 min. which I count upon the
sides of the Square down to <HI>u</HI> and <HI>t;</HI> and the base which is
80 gr. the complement of 10 gr. I count also from D to <HI>p,</HI>
then I follow the line <HI>p,</HI> till it cut the threed at <HI>x,</HI> and the
line there arising is <HI>x y,</HI> which counted from DC, whereon
the difference of the legs was reckoned, shall give 38 grad.
56 min. that is, two hours and almost 36 min. of an houre
from the Meridian or South.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> That the threed in this situation, shewes on the dia|meter
of the Square (which in this case represents the Hori|zon)
the <HI>Semidiurnal</HI> and <HI>Seminocturnai</HI> Arks, for where the
threed crosseth the middle line, the line there arising, (counted
from that side of the Square, whereon the difference was num|bred)
shewes the <HI>Semidiurnal</HI> ark, and counted from the other
side, shewes the <HI>Seminocturnal</HI> ark.</P>
<P><HI>Observe also,</HI> If you would known the <HI>Crepusculum</HI> or <HI>Twi|light,</HI>
the threed is to be placed as before, according to the
sum and difference of the legs, and if you allow 18 gr. for the
<PB N="8" REF="5">
<HI>Crepusculin</HI> line (as they usually doe) the base will alway be
108 gr. which in the two first Examples will not touch the
threed at all, and therefore in that latitude and parallel of the
Sun, the twilight continues all night. But in the last Example
you shall find the <HI>Crepusculin</HI> line to cut the threed, 6 hours
and 15 min. from the Meridian, which shewes that the twi|light
begins at 5&frac34; a clock in the morning, and ends at 6&frac14; in
the evening, and the rest of the time is dark night which is
11&frac12; hours.</P>
<P>If the sum of the the legs be more then 180 gr. that is, if it
would reach beyond the bottom of the Square, you must
when you have reckoned to the bottom, count upward back
again till you have ended the whole sum.</P>
</DIV5>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="2" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>SECONDLY,</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Having the Latitude of the place, the Declination and
Altitude of the Sun, To find the Azimuth
of the Sun.</HEAD>
<P>HEre also the 3 sides are given, the same with the former,
and an Angle sought. The two legs are the Comple|ments
of the latitude, and Suns altitude, The base is
the Suns distance from the Pole which is elevated above the
Horizon. The angle sought is the Suns <HI>Azimuth,</HI> from that
part of the Meridian, which is of the same denomination with
the elevated Pole.</P>
<P>So then according to the former general prescript, and
this particular declaration, for the <HI>Azimuth,</HI> doe thus.</P>
<P>Take the sum and difference of the Complements of the lati|tude
and Suns altitude, and count from the top of the Square,
the one upon one side, the other on the other side, and to these
terms apply the threed; Then from the top of the Square also,
count the Suns distance from the Pole, and where it doth crosse
the threed, the line that there ariseth Square to the former, being
reckoned from that side of the Square whereon the difference of
the legs was counted, gives the Azimuth from that part of the
Meridian which is of the same denomination with the elevated
Pole, and counted from the other side, gives the Azimuth from
the other coast.</P>
<DIV5 TYPE="sub-subsection">
<PB N="9" REF="5">
<HEAD>To Illustrate it by an Example.</HEAD>
<P>In a North latitude of 52 gr. 30 min. let the altitude of
the Sun be 22 gr. and the declination 10 gr. Northerly, By
these given I would know the Suns Azimuth, the two legs of
the Triangle are the complements of the latitude and Suns
altitude, that is 37 gr. 30 min. and 68 gr. the sum of them is
105 gr. 30 min. the difference is 30 gr. 30 min. The sum of
them I count on the side BA, from the top at B down to <HI>k,</HI>
The difference I count on the other side from D down to <HI>h,</HI>
and to these points <HI>k</HI> and <HI>h,</HI> I apply the threed <HI>k h,</HI> And last|ly,
because the de|clination
is 10 gr.
North-ward in a
North latitude, ther|fore
his distance
from the elevated
Pole is 80 gr. which I
count from the top
D, down to <HI>l,</HI> and
follow the line at <HI>l,</HI>
till it meet with the
threed at <HI>n,</HI> where
I find the line <HI>m n,</HI> to
crosse it also, which
numbred from the
side DC, whereon
the difference of the legs was numbred, gives 102 gr 38 m.
the Azimuth from the North: And so also if it be account|ed
from the side BA, it gives the Azimuth from the South
77 gr. 22 min. the residue of the former, or the complement
of it to 180 gr.
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><HI>Another Example,</HI> In the same latitude and the same al|titude,
and therefore also the same situation, of the threed,
let the declination be Northerly 23&frac12; gr. therefore the distance
from the Pole will be 66&frac12; gr. which I count from D to <HI>f,</HI> and
following the line <HI>f</HI> till it meet with the threed at <HI>i,</HI> I find the
line <HI>g i,</HI> to crosse there also, which being counted from the
side DC, whereon the difference of the legs was counted,
<PB N="10" REF="6">
shewes 79 gr. 38 min. the Azimuth from the North, Or count|ed
from the other side, gives the residue of the former, 100 gr.
22 min. The Azimuth from the South.</P>
<P><HI>A third Example.</HI> In the same latitude and altitude, and
therefore also in the same situation of the threed, let the de|clination
of the Sun be 10 gr. to the South, then shall his di|stance
from the elevated North Pole be 100 gr. and because
this 100 gr. is the base, I therefore count it from the top D,
down to <HI>o,</HI> and following the line <HI>o,</HI> I find it to cut the threed
at <HI>r,</HI> and the line <HI>r p</HI> there crossing, shewes me from DC, (the
side whereon the difference of the legs was counted) 146 gr.
32 min. for the Azimuth from the North, or if the same line
be numbred from the side BA, it shewes 33 gr. 28 min. the
residue of the former, for the Azimuth from the South.</P>
<P>These Examples may suffice for this kind, and according
to these patternes, all others are to be framed.</P>

</DIV4>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>In any Spherical Triangle whatsoever.</HEAD>
<HEAD>&para;By having the legs and Vertical Angle, to find the Base.</HEAD>
<P><HI>From the top of the Square, count the sum of the legs upon one
side, the difference of them on the other side. To this sum and
difference apply the threed: Then from that side of the Square
whereon the difference of the legs was numbred, count the
Vertical Angle given, and where it cuts the threed, mark
the line that passeth there-through parallel to the top of the
Square, for that line, counted from the top, gives the base
required.</HI></P>
<P>This is general for all works of this kind, which may be
illustrated in particular: thus,</P>
<P><HI>Having the latitude of the place, the declination of the Sun,
and the hour of the day, to find the altitude of the Sun, for
that latitude, declination, and hour.</HI></P>
<P>HEre have we the two legs of the Triangle, with the in|tercepted
Vertical Angle, given, and the base sought.
The legs are the complement of the latitude, and the
Suns distance, from the Pole; The angle intercepted is the
<PB N="11" REF="6">
hour whose altitude we seek. And the base is the complement
of the altitude sought for.</P>
<P><HI>Wherefore by the former general prescipt, and this parti|cular
explication, we may attain to the thing required thus,
as in the former practice, so here;</HI> Apply the threed to the sum
and difference of the complement of the latitude, and of the Suns
distance from the Pole, Then reckon the hour given from the
Meridian, from the side whereon the difference of the legs was
counted, and where it crosseth the threed observe the line that
passeth there-through parallel to the top of the Square, for that
line reckoned from the top, shewes the base, that is, The com|plement
of the altitude, or reckoned from the middle line of the
Square, it gives the altitude it self of the Sun, for that parallel
and Hour; And so the threed (which now represents the Suns
parallel:) lying still, you may count the altitudes for all the rest
of the hours for that parallel.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>For Example.</HEAD>
<P>In a North latitude of 52 gr. 30 min. let the Sun decline
20 gr. to the North, so that his distance from the elevated
North-pole will be 70 gr. which is one of the legs given, and
the complement of the latitude, 37 gr. 30 min. is the other,
The sum of them is 107 gr. 30 min. The difference is 32 gr.
30 min. This difference is the complement of the Suns Meri|dian
altitude; and I count it from D the top of the Square, to
<HI>k:</HI> (in the first figure) thereto applying one end of the threed
And on the other side from B, I count the sum, 107 gr. 30 min.
down to <HI>l,</HI> thereto applying the other end of the threed. The
threed thus laid, resembles the Suns parallel, for that decli|nation,
Now from the side D <HI>k,</HI> whereon the difference was
numbred, I count the Vertical Angle, As first 15 gr. for the
first hour from the Meridian, either 11 in the morning, or one
in the afternoon, and where it cuts the threed, I observe the
other line there crossing also, which counted from the top,
gives for the base, 34 gr. 32 min. the complement of the al|titude
required.</P>
<P><HI>Or rather.</HI> Count it from the middle line, which in this case
represents the Horizon, and then you shall have 55 gr. 28 m.
the altitude it self, for that hour and parallel, So the second
<PB N="12" REF="7">
hour from the Meridian (10 or 2) gives for the altitude 50 gr.
4 min. The third hour (9 or 3) gives 42 gr. 31 m. The fourth
hour from the Meridian (8 or 4) gives 33 gr. 53 min. The
fifth (7 or 5) gives 24 gr. 48 min. The sixth (6 in the morn|ing
and evening) gives 15 gr. 45 m. The seventh (5 in the morn|ing,
or 7 in the evening) gives 7 gr. 6 m. And so farrethe Sun is
above the Horizon in that parallel, and then begins to go down.</P>
<P>And observe further, That the threed thus placed taken in
that part below the Horizon, gives the altitudes for the hours
in the declination which is equal to this, but to a contrary
coast; so that the threed in this situation, gives the altitudes
for the declination of 20 grad. towards the South, for that
part of the threed that is under the Horizon or middle
line, is the Semi-nocturnal ark for the parallel lying 20 gr.
from the Equinoctial Northward, and is therefore equal
to the Semi-diurnal ark that belongs to the parallel which
lies 20 gr. from the Equinoctial Southward, and is of like si|tuation
below the Horizon that the other is above, wherefore
the depressions belonging to the hours in this, are the same
with the altitudes of the same hours in the other. To go on then
where we left, The next hour counted from the Meridian of
the Winter parallel is the fourth, that is, either 8 in the morning,
or 4 in the afternoon, and his depression is 0 gr. 50 min. The
next hour the third from the Meridian (either 9 or 3) is de|pressed
7 gr. 39 m. The second hour, (10 or 2) is 12 gr. 57 m.
The first hour (11 or 1,) is depressed in this North parallel
16 gr. 20 min. that is, it is elevated so much in the like South
parallel. Thus of each two opposite parallels of declination
may the altitudes be had at one and the same situation of the
threed. But if the other way seeme plainer, do as before.
Let the Sun in the same latitude decline 20 gr. to the South,
his distance from the North elevated Pole, is then 110 gr. the
sum of the complement of the latitude 37 gr. 30 min. and
this distance is 147 gr. 30 min. The difference is 72 gr. 30 m.
This difference I count from D to <HI>t,</HI> (in the first figure,) The
sum I also account as before, from B to <HI>u,</HI> And to <HI>t u,</HI> I placed
the threed, Now from the side D <HI>t,</HI> I count the hours as I did
before, and find the altitude of 11 and 1, 16 gr. 20 min. of 10
and 2, 12 gr. 57 min. of 9 and 3, 7 gr. 39 min. of 8 and 4,
0 gr. 50 min. All the same that the former depressions were;
<PB N="13" REF="7">
And if now you take the depressions of the hours upon the
threed in this situation, you shall find them all the same that
the altitudes in the former parallel of 20 gr. North declination
were; So that ever, one side of the threed will afford the al|titudes
for the hours in any two opposite parallels.</P>
<P>The Meridian altitude is the complement of the difference
of the legs, And in the opposite parallel it is the excesse of
the sum of the legs above 90 gr. And as you have done for
the Altitudes of the whole hours, so may you doe for their
halves and quarters. Thus much for this also.</P>

66 gr. 30 min. The complement of the altitude, 44 gr. 20 m.
By these things known, I would find the Azimuth. The pro|portion
whereby it is wrought is this.
As the Sine of the hour, is to the Sine
of the complement of the altitude; So
is the sine of the distance, to the sine of
the Azimuth. Wherefore upon the side
of the Square EG, I count the sine
of 45 gr. to <HI>h,</HI> and upon the line there
arising, I count the sine of 44 gr.
20 min. up to <HI>i,</HI> and thereto apply the
threed. Then upon the same side with
the first I reckon the sine of the Suns distance 66 gr. 30 min.
from E to <HI>k,</HI> and following the line there arising till it meet
with the threed at <HI>n,</HI> I find the line <HI>nl,</HI> to crosse there also,
which counted from EG, gives the sine of 65 gr. for the fourth
proportional, so that 65 gr. shewes the residue of the Angle
required, that is to say, In our North latitude it shewes me
the Azimuth from the South; because the Angle of the A|zimuth
from the North is an obtuse Angle, namely 115 gr.
and the same sine serves both to it and to 65 gr. his residue.

<P>&para;And here also is to be noted, That when any Proportion in
right sines alone is offered, and the radius is the first leader
<PB N="15" REF="8">
in the Proportion, that then I say, it may be resolved by the
former kind of work, by the sum and difference, counting the
complement of the arks of the two Sines given, for the legs of
the Triangle, and the ark of the radius or 90 gr. for the Ver|tical
Angle, and the base found out to be the complement of the
ark required. <HI>As in the first Example,</HI></P>
<P>The two middle arks were 30 gr. and 23 gr. 30 min. their
complements are 60 gr. and 66 g. 30 min. The sum of these is
126 gr. 30 min. there difference 6 gr. 30 min. to this sum and
difference, I apply the threed, as in the former Examples, and
then count the Vertical Angle 90 gr. which fals in the middle
line and where the threed cuts it, there is the quantity of
the Declination, 11 gr. 30 min. as before: And these degrees
are counted from the Center of the Square at E.</P>
<P>And thus may all others of this nature, having the radius in
the first place, be absolved. And not onely these of sines
alone, but with sines intermingled with Tangents also,
If it so fall out that these Tangents be lesse then the
radius, And if instead of their proper arks be taken the
complements of the arks of sines equal unto those Tan|gents.</P>

<P>Here because the proportions are divers, we shall need
more explication then in all the rest. Yet the variety herein, may
<PB N="16" REF="9">
be reduced to three wayes according as one of these three, either
the Radius; Sine, or Tangent, doth lead in the Proportion, the
three wayes are these:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 As the radius, is to a tangent, So is a sine to a Tangent.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 As a sine, is to a tangent, So the Radius is to another
tangent.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3 As a tangent, is to the radius, So another tangent, is to a

</LIST></P>
<P>But this variety is not all, for each of these three wayes is
subject to variation, and that upon this occasion.&mdash;Vpon
the square we have no tangent greater then the radius, or tangent
of 45 degrees. Wherefore the proportion must be so contrived,
as that no tangent greater then of 45 gr. be ingredient into it.
To that purpose serves this general direction, namely,&mdash;If
the tangent which is co-partner, in the proportion with the sine, be
greater then of 45 gr. (alway provided that the two tangents
doe never stand immediately together, which if they doe, may be
brought into frame by transposition or alteration of the middle
term.) Then, In the two first wayes the radius and sine must
change places; and for the two tangents must be taken the tan|gents
of their complements; In the third way, the co-tangents of
the third and first terms must remove into the first and third
places.</P>

<MILESTONE N="I"><HI>For the first of the three several wayes</HI> there are three cases,

<P><HI>Vpon the Square</HI> EIDG, I count EG for the radius, and

cut the threed <HI>E a,</HI> at <HI>c,</HI> So that <HI>b c</HI> is the fourth term requi|red,
which because it is a tangent, must be numbred in the
Scale of tangents, and therefore by help of the line <HI>c e,</HI> I
transferre it thither, and find that the line lies even against
32 gr. 44 min. in the Scale of Tangents, and this is the ark
of the fourth proportional term required.</P>
<P>2 <HI>As the radius</HI> is to the Tangent of 60 gr. So the sine of
50 gr. to the Tangents of what?</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
Upon the Square I count (as be|fore)
from G up to D and so for|ward
to <HI>n,</HI> 60 gr. among the Tan|gents,
and thereto apply the threed.
Then I count the third term. E <HI>b</HI> the
sine of 50 gr. and I follow the line
there arising to the top of the Square,
and yet it meets notwith the threed,
but beyond the Square I see that it
would concurre with it at <HI>r,</HI> which
shewes that the fourth Tangent re|quired,
is greater then the Tangent of 45 gr. and therefore
standing as it doth, cannot be expressed upon the Scale of
Tangents, wherefore I alter the Proportion, by transposing
the first and third terms into one anothers places, and for
the Tangents themselves I take their complement thus.</P>
<P>As the sine of 50, is to the Co-tangent of 60, So is the
Radius, to a fourth Tangent, which will be the complement
of that which should be produced by the former Proportion.
By this alteration it comes to passe that the sine leads in the
Proportion, and so this Example now fals under the Examples
of the second General way, and therefore shall be resolved
there.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="10">
3 <HI>As the radius</HI> is to the Tangent of 50 gr. so the sine of

<P>Upon the Square I take EG for the radius, and at the end
of it I reckon up to D, which is 45 gr. and so forward on the

the sine of 50 gr. and follow the line there arising till it cut
the threed at <HI>i,</HI> so that <HI>b i</HI> is the fourth term, and because it
is a Tangent, therefore by help of the line passing through
<HI>i,</HI> that is, by the line <HI>i m,</HI> I transferre it to the Scale of Tan|gents,
and find that lies even against 42 gr. 24 min. which is
the fourth ark required.</P>
<P><HI>For the second of the three general wayes,</HI> there are two <MILESTONE N="II">
Cases; For the Tangent that is Copartner with the sine in the
Proportion, may be either lesser or greater then of 45 gr.
for the lesser, take the Example which before was preferred
hither, namely,</P>
<P>1 As the sine of 50 gr. is to the Tangent of 30 gr. So the
radius is to the Tangent of what?</P>
<P>First, upon the side EG, I count the sine of 50 gr. and to
the line there arising, I transferre Gt the Tangent of 30 gr.
by help of the line <HI>t s,</HI> and to <HI>s,</HI> I apply the threed, which
threed cuts the limb in <HI>u,</HI> so that G <HI>u</HI> I find to be the Tangent
of 37 gr. and this is the fourth term required in this Propor|tion;
But in the second Example going before, whereof
this is also the solution, this 37 gr. is the complement
of the fourth ark there required, so that the fourth ark there,
should be 53 gr. which because it is greater then 45 gr. is
therefore absolved this way, and not the other.</P>
<P>2 As the sine of 50 gr. is to the tangent of 50 gr. So the
radius is to the Tangent of what?</P>
<P>Here because the Tangent of 50 (being Co-partner in the
Proportion with the sine) is greater then the Tangent of
45 gr. and so cannot be expressed upon the square, therefore
the Proportion must be altered by changing the places of the
first and third terms, and by taking the complement of the
second and fourth, after this manner.</P>
<P>As the radius is to the Tangent of 40 gr. So the sine of
50 gr. to the Tangent of 32 gr. 44 min. the complement

first practice upon the Square, As EG, to G <HI>a,</HI> So E <HI>b,</HI> to <HI>b c,</HI>

<P><MILESTONE N="III"><HI>In the third of the three general wayes,</HI> there are two cases,
according as the Tangent of the third place, which is Co-partner
in the proportion with the sine, is lesser or greater
then the Tangent of 45 degrees.</P>
<P>1 <HI>As t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e tangent</HI> of 40 gr. is to the Radius, so the Tangent
of 32 gr. 44 min. to what sine?</P>
<P>Upon the side GD, I count G <HI>a,</HI> the Tangent of 40 gr.
and thereto apply the threed, then upon the same side GD,
I reckon also the Tangent of 32 gr. 44 min. from G to <HI>e,</HI> and
follow the line meeting at <HI>e,</HI> till it cut the threed at <HI>c,</HI> and
the line there crossing also is <HI>c b,</HI> which counted from <HI>e,</HI> the
Center of the Square, gives the sine of 50 gr. which is the
fourth term required.</P>
<P>2 As the Tangent of 60 gr. is to the radius, So the Tan|gent
of 53 gr. to what sine?</P>
<P>Here because the Tangent of 53 gr. being Co-partner in
Proportion with the sine, is greater then of 45 gr. therefore
the first and third terms must change places, and their com|plements
are also to be taken, thus, As the co-tangent of
53 gr. or Tangent of 37 gr. is to the Radius, So is the co-tan|gent
of 60 gr. or Tangent of 30 gr. to the fourth sine re|quired.</P>
<P>Upon GD the side of the Square, I count G <HI>u</HI> the Tangent
of 37 gr. thereto applying the threed. Then on the same side
of the Square, I also count G <HI>t,</HI> the Tanegnt of 30 gr. and
follow the line at <HI>t,</HI> till it cut the threed at <HI>s,</HI> and the line <HI>s b,</HI>
there crossing being counted from <HI>e,</HI> the Center of the Square,
gives me the Sine of 50 gr. the fourth term required.</P>

apply the threed, Then upon AC, I count the third term,
60 to K, and follow the line there arising, till it meet with
the threed at <HI>p,</HI> and there the line <HI>p m,</HI> meeting also, shewes
in the Scale <HI>AB</HI> at <HI>m,</HI> 75 parts, which is the fourth propor|tional
number required. And thus in all others.</P>

<HEAD>Of the use of the Square in the observation of angles.</HEAD>
<P>WHen the observation is made and the sight placed, then
the threed from A, applyed to the running sight,
will expresse the angle in the larger Tangent, And for
observing any altitude or depth, the threed alone, without the
help of the running sight, will expresse the Angle, if the obser|vation
be made as usually it is by other Instruments.&mdash;The
Square at the greatest cannot observe an Angle that is greater
then 90. If therefore such an Angle come to be observed, you
must observe the residue of it, which is his complement to
180 degrees.</P>
<P>Hitherto we have had a general view of the use of the Square
in all Triangles and ordinary Proportions in Numbers. Now
remains the bringing of it down to particulars in every kind;
which would be an infinite labour, and un-necessary to those that
are any thing experienced, in the use of Instruments, especially
seeing we have here a tast of every of them, and the particular
Proportions are every where extant. Hereafter I may adde
something more on the other side, for the present I here make
stay, and content my selfe with that which hath already been
delivered.</P>
