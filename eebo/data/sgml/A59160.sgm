<HEAD>THE AUTHOURS PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_PRide</HI> hath made so powerfull an impression in the soule of man, as that all the paines he suffers are not able to efface it. <HI>He</HI> is proud amidst his <HI>Misfortunes;</HI> and though he have lost all those <HI>Advantages</HI> which caused <HI>Vaine-glory</HI> in him, yet ceaseth he not to be vaine-glorious amidst his <HI>Miseries.</HI> He is still flattered in his <HI>Exile</HI> with those promises which the <HI>Devill</HI> made him in <HI>Paradise:</HI> though he be slave to as many <HI>Masters</HI> as he hath <HI>Passions,</HI> yet he aspires to the <HI>Worlds Soveraignty;</HI> though his <HI>Doubts</HI> doe sufficiently prove his <HI>Ignorance,</HI> yet doth he pre|tend <NOTE PLACE="marg">Vult homo i|mitari <HI>Deum</HI> sed pervers&egrave;, non esse sub illius potesta|te, sed habere contra illum potestatem. <HI>Aug.</HI> in <HI>Psal.</HI> 60.</NOTE> to the <HI>Knowledge</HI> of Good and <HI>Evill;</HI> and though all the <HI>Sicknesses</HI> which assaile him, teach him that he is <HI>Mortall,</HI> yet doth he promise to himselfe <HI>Immortality.</HI> But, that which is more in|supportable, and which renders his fault more insolent, is; that he hopes to arrive at all this happinesse by his <HI>Owne Strength:</HI> he thinks nothing impossible to a creaure that is <HI>Free</HI> and <HI>Rationall,</HI> that his <HI>Good</HI> depends upon his <HI>Will;</HI> and that without any other help then what he drawes from <HI>Nature,</HI> he may acquit himselfe of his <HI>Losses,</HI> and <HI>Recover</HI> his <HI>Innocence.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Errour</HI> being the <HI>Outmost</HI> of all our evils, <HI>Religion</HI> labours only how to dis-abuse us therein, and all her <HI>Commandements</HI> and <HI>Advices</HI> tend only to make us <HI>Sensible</HI> of our misfortune. The <HI>Sacrifices</HI> teach us that we have deserved <HI>Death;</HI> the <HI>Law</HI> teacheth us that we are <HI>Blind,</HI> and the <HI>Difficulty</HI> we find in <HI>Keeping</HI> it doth prove our <HI>Want</HI> of <HI>Power. Grace</HI> doth yet more <HI>strongly</HI> insinuate this truth unto us; sh: u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">dertakes not to cure us, till she hath per|swaded us that we are <HI>Sick;</HI> and the <HI>First</HI> thing which she makes us acknowledge, is our <HI>Ignorance</HI> and <HI>Weaknesse. Nature,</HI> as proud as she is, agrees in this point with <HI>Grace:</HI> her <HI>Disorders</HI> are so many

<P>It must also be confest, that the <HI>Wisest Philosophers</HI> have acknow|ledged that there was a <HI>Hidden Cause</HI> of all these <HI>Disorders;</HI> and being prest by their <HI>Consciences,</HI> they have confest, that since <HI>Na|ture</HI> deales more hardly with <HI>Vs</HI> than with her <HI>Other Children,</HI> some secret fault must of necessity have been, which hath incensed her against us.

<P>Only the <HI>Stoicks,</HI> whose whole Philosophy is enlivened with Vain-glory, did beleeve that if man were irregular, 'twas on|ly because he <HI>Would</HI> be so; and that as his <HI>Liberty</HI> had been the sole <HI>Cause</HI> of his <HI>Mischiefe,</HI> it m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ght also be the sole <HI>Remedy</HI> thereof: they imagined, that if he would take <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Reason</HI> for his <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bonum homi|nis, animus &amp; ratio in animo perfecta: quid autem ab illo exigis? rem facillimum, se|cund&ugrave;m <HI>Na|turam</HI> vivere. <HI>Senec.

<HEAD>Of the Corruption of Nature by SINNE: <HI>The First Treatise:</HI> Of Originall Sin, and the Effects thereof.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The First Discourse.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>That Faith acknowledgeth Originall Sin: That Nature hath a feeling thereof: and That Phylosophie suspects it.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_THough mans misery witnesse his sin, and that to believe he is guilty, sufficeth to prove his misery; yet is there no one Truth in Christian Religion, more strongly withstood by prophanePhylo|sophers then is this; shee cannot allow of a chastisement which punisheth the father in his children, neither can shee conceive a sin which precedes our rea|son as well as our birth; Shee appeals from so rigorous a decree, and thinks to defend Gods cause in pleading ours: Shee attributes all our disorders to our constituti|on, she imputes our errours to our education, and the greatest part
<PB N="2" REF="9">
of our irregularities to the bad employing of our time: She <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Errasti, si exi|stimas nobiscum vitianasci su|pervenerunt in|gesta sunt. <HI>Sen. Epist.</HI> 94.</NOTE> oppo|seth experience by arguing, and what ever misery shee makes tryall of shee will not acknowledge the cause; shee thinks a man may here|in defend himselfe by reason, and that there being no sin which is naturall, neither is there any which may not be amended by will alone: shee makes use of the examples of <HI>Socrates, Aristides,</HI> and <HI>Cato:</HI> shee opposeth these Sages to our Saints, and pretends that the works of Nature yield not to those of Grace: Briefly, shee corrup|teth the purity of our beliefe by the subtilty of her reasoning; and whereas Christians ought to convert all Phylosophers, some Chri|stians are perverted by Phylosophers. We confesse Originall sinne because we dare not deny it; <HI>We avow that it hath bereft us of Grace, but assure our selves that it hath left us an entire Liberty; We confesse it hath robb'd us of our innocencie, but maintain that we may recover our innocencie by the means of reason, and that if we cannot merit heaven, we may at least secure our selves from hell:</HI> We admire the famous Actions of Infidels; our eyes are dazl'd with the lustre they receive from the writings of Phylosophers; we side, at unawares, with Na|ture against Grace, and through an inconsiderate zeale: We will have their delusive vertues rewarded with a true happinesse.</P>
<P>Yet notwithstanding to believe original sin, is one of the prime Articles of our Faith; if <HI>Adam</HI> were not guilty; Jesus Christ was not necessary; and if Humane nature be yet in her first purity, it's in vain that we seek a Saviour: Hence <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">In causa duo|rum hominum quorum per u|nuro venum de|tisumus sub pec|cato, per <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">lterum redimimur &agrave; peccatis proprie fides Christiana Consistit. <HI>Aug. lib de peccato. Origin. cap.</HI> 24</NOTE> it is that the great Apostle of the Gentiles doth so often in his Epistles oppose sin to grace; ser|vitude to freedome; and <HI>Adam</HI> to Jesus Christ; he is pleased to re|present unto us the disorders of Nature, to make us admire the ef|fects of Grace, and he glories in his Infirmities, the more to heighth|en the advantages of Redemptio~, He teacheth us that we are concei|ved in sin, and that at our first enterance into the world we are the ob|jects of Gods wrath. He shews us that <HI>Adams</HI> sin is shed abroad throughout mankind, That his Malady is become a contagion, and that all the Children that do descend from this unfortunate Father are Criminall, and Miserable. The <HI>Prophets</HI> agree with the <HI>Apostles,</HI> and this truth is not much less Evident in the Old Testament then in the New. The most patient &amp; most afflicted of al men co~plaines of the misfortunes of his birth, and makes such just imprecations against the moment wherin he was conceived, as we may easily conceive, he
<PB N="3" REF="9">
thought it not void of fault. <HI>David</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Pereat dies in qu&acirc; natu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> sum, &amp; nox in qu&acirc; dictum est conceptus est homo. <HI>Job</HI> 3.</NOTE> confesseth he was conceived in sin, and that though he were born in lawfull Matrimony, his birth ceaseth not to be shamefully sinfull.</P>
<P>The Church confirmes this truth unto us, by as many Paradoxes, as the instructions are, which she giveth us. And knowing that her words serves for laws unto her Children, she is pleased to tell us, that <HI>Adam's</HI> sin is ours, That the miseries which we undergoe, are the punishments of his disobedience, That Divine Justice hath condemned us in Him: That our misfortune and His sinne did precede our Birth, And that contrary to all the Laws of Mo|rality, we be guilty before we are reasonable. Faith perswades us to these Truths, and without troubling our selves to seek Proofs to strengthen them, we in all humility believe what we cannot evident|ly know; But because Phylosophy is a Rebel to Faith, and that she is more swayd by reason, then by the Authority of the Church, I will convince her by reason, and make her confess, that we could not be irregular, if we were not guilty.</P>
<P>All Phylosophers confess, <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Princeps &amp; Domina carnis naturaliter ani|ma est quae do|mare carnem debet &amp; regere. <HI>August. contra Julian, lib. 2. cap.</HI> 8.</NOTE> That man is Composed of a body &amp; soul, And that when Divine Providence did first forme him, she mingled Beast with Angell, and that she gathered Heaven and Earth together to finish her Noblest piece of workmanship. If Passion have not prevail'd over reason in these great men, they must confess that when God did this his Chiefest work, he did so well accord the two Parts which went to the Composition thereof, as that the body obey'd the soul, &amp; the Angell comanded over the Beast. They must acknowledge that God observ'd the same Order in the Composing of man, as he did in the making of the world, and that as he submit|ted the Earth to the Influences of the Heavens, he did likewise as|subject Passion to reason, and the Appetite to the will. And since they observe this decent order to be no longer kept, they ought ne|cessarily to infer, that sin is the cause thereof, And that man hath lost these advantages only because he hath not preserved his Inno|cency. For what likelyhood is there, that two Parts joyned toge|ther, should not indure one another, that they should mutually love and hate each other, that the flesh should wage war with the soul, which gives it life, and that the soule should complain of the others insolency, which serves her as an Officer or Abetter, <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Etiam sine magistro vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ia disc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>Se|neca lib. 3. quaest. c.</HI> 30.</NOTE> whence is it that our inclinations are out of Order, before we have acquired any
<PB N="4" REF="10">
bad Habits, that our faults precede evill examples, that we know what evill is, not having learned it, and that the soul follows the in|clinations of her body, before she hath tasted the delights thereof: whence is it, that sin is naturall to us, that in us it preceeds the use of reason, that notwithstanding all its deformities, it becomes pleasing, and that vertue with all her comlinesse seem austere unto us. Cer|tainly, he who shall conceive aright, the reason thereof, will be obli|ged either to blame Divine Providence, or els to condemne the sin|fulness of the first man, who losing originall Justice, deprived all his Children thereof, And who making us inherit his disorders, made us criminall, before rationall.</P>
<P>The Morall Vertues, which Phylosophers boast so much off, doe authorize the beleife of originall sin. For though they perswade themselves, that man by the assistance thereof may overcome sin; and that God did not Compose him of two rebellious Parts, save only to increase his merit, and to leave unto him the glory of finish|ing it; yet the use of vertue doth sufficiently prove his irregularity, and it is sufficient to acknowledge that he was born guilty, since we know he is obliged to become vertuous. For vertue is not a producti|on of Nature, but an invention of Art, she is not infused, but ac|quired, and the Pains she causeth, fully equall the Pleasures which she promiseth. She presupposeth that man is out of order, since she hath a design to reforme him, and that he is sick since she endeavours to cure him. All her exercises are so many Combats, all her enemies are born in the very Place where she sets upon them, and the industry she is forced to make use off to drive them thence, doth sufficiently witness that they govern there before her; in effect man is weak, before he hath acquired fortitude, he is foolish before wise, and ere temperate, unchast, his vertues are proofs of his vices, his last victories are signes of his former defeats, and the succour which he is enforced to seek for, from without himselfe, is a witness of his dis|order and weakness. This it was that made <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Conit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ntia tam concupis|centiae testis est quam host is. <HI>August.</HI></NOTE> St: <HI>Augustine</HI> say, that continency is as well a witness as an enemy of concupiscence, &amp; that althose glorious habits which fight against our sins do manifest them.</P>
<P>If vertue make us suspect our misery, the Creatures revolt makes us know our sinfulness; and he who shall consider that man is in the world, as in an enemies Country, will have no great difficulty to judge that he is Criminall. Reason unasisted by Faith is sufficient to
<PB N="5" REF="10">
make us Comprehend that man is the Image of God; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> That he is <NOTE PLACE="marg">g Itaque foeli|citer homo na|tus jacet mani|bus pedibusque devinctis, flens animal caeteris imperaturum &amp; &agrave; suppliciis vitam vispica|tur unam tan|tum ob culpam quia natum est. <HI>Plin. lib. 6. proem.</HI></NOTE> his Lieutenant upon Earth, That all Creatures owe him homage, and that he ought to Reigne in the World: either as a visible Angell, or as a Mortall God. The Place he beares in the Universe challeng|eth this Advantage; and reason which raiseth him above Beasts, gives him the Sovereignty over them, since all things are made for his use, all must be submitted to his will. And since he must Reign with God in Heaven, he must begin to Reign for him upon the Earth; This notwithstanding all Creatures make war upon him, they deal with him, rather as with a Tyrant, then Lawfull Sovereign: They obey him not, but by Force, And it is easie to be seen, That having lost the right that he had over them, he co~ands them, now, only by violence, if he draw any service from beasts, its after having been either their Slave, or their Tyrant. If <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Omnis crea|tura pugnabit contra insensa|tos.</NOTE> the earth be fruitfull, its after having been watered with his sweat, and rent in peeces by the Plough; If the Sea bear his vessels tis not without threatning them with shipwrack.

<P>This generall insurrection is a token and punishment of his offence, had he preserved his integrity he had never lost his Authority, and had he not falne from his innocency he had never forgon his Throne. Phylosophy as haughty as she is, cannot deny but that man is the prey of wild beasts, and the victime of their fury, that he is exposed to the rigour of the Aire, and to the unseasonableness of the weather, she must confess that he hath no subject which is not rebellious, that there is no place within his Territories which is not his enemy, and there is no part of his body which is not either disobedient or un|faithfull to him, whence proceeds this disorder, if not from his sin whence proceeds so universall a rebellion, if not from his disobedi|ence, and why should he have lost his authority in the world, if he had not lost his innocency, which was the foundation thereof, I ve|ry well know that Phylosophers who knew not the state of sin, en|deavour to excuse this insurrection, alledging it is naturall, but who sees not the excusing of man, is to blame God, and that to leave innocency, to the Creature, is to bereave God of his Providence:

<HEAD>The third Discourse.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of what kinde the first Sinne which <HI>ADAM</HI> committed was.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe two first sins of the World are the most unknown, and Divines which agree in so many differing subjects have not as yet been able to agree in this. They know that the Angels and man, are become Criminall, but they know not what the nature of their fault is. They know that both of them have violated the laws of God, and that over-weaning their own perfections they have not sufficiently prized the perfections of their Creator they very well know that neither of them have preserved their Innocency; and that weaknesse (which is inseparable from the Creature) hath been the cause of their Fall, but they know not what name to give
<PB N="13" REF="15">
to this sinne, nor under what degree to rank this crime, which hath caused so much Mischeife, Some think that the offence Com|mitted by the Angel was so Generall, as in the extent thereof it in|cludes all other offences, that he flew from God by all the wayes it was possible for him to estrange himself from him, that using the utmost ofhis power he grew guilty ofall the wickednesse; which so enlightned a spirit was capable of: whence it is that the holy Scri|ptures; to teach us the truth thereof, terms his fault somtimes Mur|ther, sometimes Adultery, sometimes Rebellion, though man be not so Active as the Angel, and that his soul confined within his bo|dy, be slower in her operations, yet there have been some Divines, who hath given the same Judgment of both their sins, and who have perswaded themselves that <HI>Adam</HI> by one only offence, became guil|ty of all sins, that the law which was proposed unto him, conteining in it an Abridgment of all Laws, he could not violate it without vio|lating all the rest; that his disobedience, under one only name Com|prehended all sins, and that by one only attempt he <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Nam &amp; su|perbia illio est quia homini in sua potius esse quam in Dei po|testate dil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">xit, &amp; sacrilegium qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Deo non credidit, homi|cidium quia se praecipitavit in mortem, sorni|catio spiritualis quia integritas mentis human<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> serpenti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> per|suasione corrup|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">est surtum quia cibus pro|hibitus usurpa|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> est, &amp; ava|ritia quia plus|quam sufficere sibi debuit ap|petiit. <HI>Aug. in Enchirid. c.</HI> 45.</NOTE> Committed A|dultery by failing in his fidelity to God; Theft by taking a fruit which did not belong unto him: Sacrilege by abusing his wil w^c^h was co~secrated to God: &amp; Paracide, by occasioning death unto his soul, and unto the souls of all his Children. Though this be a strange o|pinion, yet the worthinesse of the Author, makes me put a valuati|on upon it, for it is S. <HI>Augustine;</HI> yet in the rigour of reason, it is hard to conceive, that manssoul had so much of sight, as that in one sole action it committed so many sins. These sins which are imputed to man, are rather the effects then parts of his disobedience; and if I may be permitted to speak my sense after the Chiefe of all Divines, I should conceive that S <HI>Augustines</HI> design was, rather to satisfie his eloquence then the truth; and that making use of a figure which is so frequent amongst Orators, he would aggravate <HI>Adams</HI> sin to make us detest it.</P>
<P>Some others have been of opinion that Pride was the sin of the An|gel, and of man that these two Noble Creatures puft up with their own perfections, aspired after Divinity, and that vain glory, which is alwayes accompanied by blindnes, had perswaded them that being already <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Ipsi primi ho|mines per ser|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tem decepti &amp; dejecti <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> fuissent nisi plus quam acceper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t habere, &amp; plus|quam facti <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|rant esse voluis|sent: hic qui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> promis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rat di|cens eritis sicut Dii.

But I cannot think that such a thought could fall into the mind either of the Angell, or of man, they were induced with too much knowledge, not
<PB N="14" REF="16">
to know that the Creature cannot equall the Creator in Majestie, that the degrees of their separation are infinite, and that wishes are never made for things absolutely impossible, how could that desire of making himself God, ever enter into the imagination of an Angell; Since <HI>Theologie</HI> confesseth that they could never suspect the Mystery of the Incarnation, and that without being enlightned by Glory or by Faith, they never could have thought that God could make him|self man, or man become God; other Divines have therefore rather chosen to believe, that the Mysterie of the Incarnation, was the oc|casion of the Angels sin, and that having learnt by Revelation, that God was to allye himself to humane Nature, he could not tolerate that the Angelicall Nature should be deprived of this honour; imagi|ning that the Angels did very well deserve whatsoever dignity God would confer upon man.</P>
<P>Others have thought that self-love was the sin both of the Angel and of man; that seeing themselves so perfect, they grew in love w^t^h themselves; that forgetting the greatnesse of God, they considered only their own beauty, that they made an Idoll of their own under|standings; <NOTE PLACE="marg">c Prim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> homi|nis perditio a|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">or sui. <HI>Serm. 47. de diversis; c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">p</HI> 2.</NOTE> that not envying Gods perfections, they sought for all their happinesse within themselves, and that rather by an Amorous, then Proud blindnesse, they endeavoured to find out their content|ment in the Possession of their own advantages. If it be not rashnesse to go about to discover what our leaders have been ignorant of, and if a man may divide that which hath neither parts nor moments, I would say that the sin of man, and of the Angell is neither single, nor yet Composed of all sins: as S. <HI>Augustine</HI> affirmeth, weaknesse which is so naturall to the Creature, was, as it were, the disposition thereun|to, negligence the beginning, self-love the ensuing, or progresse, and Pride the accomplishment thereof; weaknesse is so naturall to the Creature, as to free it thereof, it must suffer change and be rai|sed above itself; Grace, (whose effects are so many miracles) dares not undertake to free the Creature from it: there is nothing but Glo|ry which can fix the fancy of the Creature, and take from it that In|constancy which is the cause of all it's offences. We acknowledge none but Jesus Christ to be void of sin; The Angell, and man, not being raised to this height of happinesse, we must not wonder if they be fallen, and if those which proceeded <HI>ex nihilo,</HI> did not defend themselves from sin, every perishable Creature may become Cri|minall,
<PB N="15" REF="16">
that which may lose its being may lose Grace, and what cannot preserve it selfe in Nature, will have much a doe to preserve it selfe in innocencie. Weaknesse then prepared that Angel and man to sin, and these two noble Creatures became faulty, only because they were not unchangeable, negligence begun the fault which weaknesse had prepared, they made not use of all the grace which they had received, they left a <HI>vacuum</HI> in their being which made place for sin, they did not employ all the advantages which they had received from God, and deserved to lose them, for having neg|lected them, as this fault was yet but an omission, it might have been expiated by humility, and by abasing themselves before God, it may be they might have obteined pardon, they became Idolaters at unawares, and framed vain Idols to themselves out of the workman|ship of God. This fault was already well grown, and the Angel and men were guilty of having turned their eyes from Divine perfecti|ons, to settle them upon their own advantages, yet did they only love those beauties which God had placed in them, they might have adored his Image in these Looking-glasses, and have returned to the Spring-head by these Rivolets, and by these beams have raised themselves up to the Sun: but Pride finished their fault, they grew proud of Gods favours, their vain-glory proceeded from his grace; that which should have submitted them to their Creator, was cause of their Rebellion, and the more they were beholding unto him, the lesse were they acknowledging from the times they thought them|selves able to reigne without him, they would reign in despight of him, and as soon as they had raised up a Throne unto themselves, they would have Subjects, the Angel got a party in heaven, he de|bauched some of his companions, hee made slaves of his equals, and these excellent Spirits were not ashamed to adore a creature; which though it were more elevated, was not lesse dependent upon God then were the rest: Rebellion did not, not withstanding, dis|perse it self throughout all their Orders, the number of the faith|full exceeded that of the revolters: <HI>Michael</HI> couragiously opposed himselfe to <HI>Lucifer,</HI> and be it that he made good use of his graces, or that he received addition thereunto, he kept the greater part of the Angels in their obedience, and drove the Rebels from the Em|pyerean Heaven. Man was more absolute in his unjust designe, for his sin became the sin of all his off-spring, not any one opposed
<PB N="16" REF="17">
himselfe to his blinde fury, those who lived in him, and descended from him, were guilty of his Rebellion, they lost themselves to|gether with their unfortunate Father; they suffered for a sin which they could not hinder; they found themselves engaged in death, be|fore they knew life, and wondered that not being reasonable, they were already criminall. This sin which shed it self like a contagion became the Spring-head of errour in the World. The greatest part of Hereticks have withstood it, and the pride of Phylosophy, wherewith they were puft up, would not permit them to confesse a disorder, which would have forced them to be humble; Catho|licks believe it, though they conceive it not; Faith teacheth them what reason cannot perswade them unto, and they care not though they be esteemed ignorant, so long as they may be esteemed faith|full: They finde by experience that man is become guilty, but they know not how he hath contracted this crime, they dispute not the maladie, but cannot comprehend by what secret wayes the Father hath communicated it to his children, and the children have re|ceived it from their father: This is that which we will examine in the pursuit of this Treatise.</P>

Divines are much perplexed with this difficulty, and touching the resolution thereof, Saint <HI>Austin</HI> hath oft-times doubted, whether the soul were not produced by generation, as wel as the body, all his reasons seem to be grounded upon this belief, he wil have it that the body doth infect the soul, and generation is as it were the channell of sin, which hath corrupted us.

<P>All these opinions, which I embrace and honour, doth sufficient|ly explain how <HI>Adams</HI> sin is ours, but they do not cleerly enough de|clare how we do contract it, they teach us that we are sinners, but do not discover unto us by what means we become so; wherefore, re-assuming Saint <HI>Augustines</HI> Principles, me thinks, a man may say, that <HI>Adams</HI> sin is the sin of all men, that, that which was voluntary <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Habent par|vuli originale peccatum non per animam, sed per carnem uti|que contractum animaeque refu|su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> carninam que ita unitur&punc; anima ut cum carne fit un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> persona. <HI>Aug. lib. 6. cont.

To Comprehend this truth, it is not necessary to Imagine a Treaty between God, and <HI>Adam,</HI> whereby the fathers fault, and Pu|nishment, becomes the sons; but it sufficeth to know that be|ing faln from the State of Innocency, and having lost originall righ|teousnesse, he cannot longer transmit it into his Progeny, that by ne|cessary consequence he makes them share in a Malady which he could not cure himself of, and that he communicates his sin unto them, in communicating his concupiscence. Tis enough for them to be guilty, that they are descended from him, and without seeking for causes further off, it sufficeth to prove their guilt, that they are a part of him: twould be a Prodigie, if a sinfull Father should beget Children void of sin, and we were to wonder, if nature not being re-establisht in her former Purity, her productions should not be Corrupt.</P>
<P>The difficulty is to know how the soul which issues pure and spot|lesse from out the hands of God, contracts sin when she is infused in|to the body. To this I answer, that her streight union with the body <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Cum rationa|lis anima sic lit getur corpori u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> ex ea &amp; corpor unum animal componatur, merito &agrave; materia mox inficitur, adeo ut &amp; pas|sionibus sit ob|noxia &amp; motus immoderatos more corporis subeat in exc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|sum atque defe|ctum. <HI>Marcil&punc; Fiscin. in Plau.</HI></NOTE> is one cause of her fin, that she sullyes her self by Informing it, that she receives death by giving it life, &amp; that wanting original righteous|nesse, whereby to preserve her self from the contagion, occasioned by the first mans sin, she is no sooner made companion to the body but she becomes Criminall. Thus is she unpleasing to God, because she is not in Grace with him; she is not in Grace with him, because <HI>A|dam</HI> hath lost Gods grace both for himself, and his Children, and she is sinfull because the father which unites her to the flesh, as a se|condary cause, Communicates unto her his disorder not giving her a remedy, for it powers his poyson into her, and doth not present her with an <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Ita omnis a|nima <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">Word&punc; in <HI>Adam</HI> censetur donec in Christ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> recenseatur, tamdiuimmun|da quamdiu re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tur.

This it is which Saint <HI>Au|gustine</HI> insinuates unto us in other Termes, when he says, that the Contagion of the body passeth into the soul, that the close Co~merce that is between them, makes their miseries co~mon between them; and that without extraordinary helps, an Innocent soul cannot be lodg'd in a guilty body, the purest Liquours are tainted in musty vessels; cor|rupted Air poysons those who breath therein, and infected houses give the Plague to those that live in them, Thus doth concupiscence glide from the body into the soul, and this wicked Host gives death to her that gives him life.

enlarge themselves are not so Contagious Evills as is this sin.</P>
<P>If it be wonderfull by reason of it's Effusion, it is no less miracu|lous through it's other qualities; for we are taught by Divinity that it is voluntary in the Father, and naturall in the Children; that that which was only a fault in <HI>Adam,</HI> is both a sin and a punishment in those that descend from him, that we contract by birth what he willingly committed: and that that which was free in it's beginning should become necessary in the progress thereof; He might have kept from disobedience: And we can neither shun the punishment nor the fault: we are surprized by this misfortune in our Conception we are slaves before we have the use of Liberty, and we have already offen|ded God before we knew him; we are rather, the objects of his an|ger, then of his mercy; but that which is more deplorable, we are so corrupted from the moment of our Birth, as that we oppose our selves to his will. If he favour us in our Baptisme, the first use we make of Reason is for the most part engaged in Errour: we follow the Inclinations of our first father, and his sin makes such powerfull Impressions upon our souls, as we sin in our first thoughts, we for the most part make use of our liberty only to estrange our selves from God; we have a secret opposition to his ordinance, we are so inclosed within our selves, as we can love nothing but for our own interests, which is the Rule of our actions, and we neither love nor desire any thing save what is either usefull or pleasing to us. Such is the cor|ruption of our nature, as there is almost nothing in it, which is not repugnant to the laws of God. It is so misled by sin as all the Incli|nations <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Concupiscen|tia seu libido nihil est aliud quam rei crea|tae desiderium cujus impetus mortiseros ani|ma antegratiam libens patitur, post gratiam pa|ti etiam invita compellitur. <HI>August.</HI></NOTE> thereof are perverted. In this unfortunate Condition, man can neither know nor doe good, he is inslaved, not having so much as the desire of Liberty: though he groan under the weight of his I|rons, he is affraid of being freed from them: and though his Impri|sonment be painfull, yet is not he weary thereof; he delights in do|ing evill, and findes difficulty to do what is good; the great in|clination he hath to sin doth not excuse his offence: And he cea|seth not to be guilty though he cannot shun sin, in generall to fill up the measure of so many Evils, he is blind and insensible, he sees not the Evils that environ and threaten him, he is full of wounds, and hath no feeling of them; believing himself to be whole, he seeks not for help&punc; &amp; through proud blindness, he despiseth the Physician that would restore him to health. Every man that comes <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Inest in mem|bris sed reum te non facit&punc; libe|ratus es ab illo, liber pugna sed vide ne vincaris &amp; itorum fias servus, laboras pugnando sed laetaberis tri|umphando. <HI>Beda in Rom. cap.</HI> 8.</NOTE> into this

To Expresse the Nature thereof to the life we must represent a Tyrant, who being born of sin will enlarge his Fa|thers Empire, &amp; make al mankind his slaves; it establisheth it's throne in our souls, darkens our understanding, infuseth wickednesse into our wils, and fils our memories with the remembrance of all unjust acts: It abuseth all the parts of our bodies; and works with our hands, Looks through our Eyes, Listens by our Eares, and Im|ployes all our sences to Execute it's designes; it busieth it selfe so dexterously in all our desires as thinking to satisfie our Necessities, we obey the Tyranny thereof; and Believing to do a Reasonable Act, we commit a sinfull one: if we Eat, it is in too much Excesse, or with too much delight; If we sleep, tis rather out of too much nice|ty then of necessity; if we speak, tis rather to slander then to edifie; and what we think we do for our preservation, we do for the most part for our satisfaction.</P>

Time augments it's force, Age in|creaseth Fury, and whatsoever ruines all other Customes, serves only to maintain this: but that which passeth all beliefe is that though this Habit be so violent, yet it is naturall; the others are easily de|stroyed because they contest against Nature; though they weaken her, yet they never destroy her; and let them do what they can, tis but a little Courage that is required to Conquer them: but this pas|seth into Nature, precedes our birth, and out-lives our death: Grace may well lessen it, but never extinguish it: Saints <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Quis me li|beravit &agrave; cor|pore mortis hu|jus. <HI>Paul.</HI></NOTE> groan under the rigour of it's Law, and Cals for Ayd from death against so Puissant an Enemy; and knowing that the soul cannot be set at Liberty, whilst inclosed within her body, they beg the parting thereof from the body as a favour.

No man is assured of souls health, whilst he gives harbour to this Domestick Enemy, and our hopes ought always to be mingled with Feare, till such time as Grace hath totally Extinguished Concupiscence.</P>

<P>MEn esteem those punishments the most severe which are most sensible, they believe not that God punisheth sinners unlesse the Earth quake under their feet, unlesse the Thun|der roares over their heads, unlesse the Devill sieze on their bodies, and hurries them visibly into Hell. But as Physick thinks hidden Maladies the most dangerous, and that there is no cure for the decays of the lungs or braines: so doth Divinity think secret punishments, the worst, and that such Chastizements as make most noyse are least to be dreaded. She fears not so much the destroyings of the Plague nor the disorders of war, as she doth apprehend bad habits, or Ire|gular inclinations; she much more patiently beares with the violence of diseases and the unseasonablenesse of the seasons, then with the motions of concupiscnce: for it is indeed the cruellest punishments which Divine Justice hath permitted for the Chastizement of mans offence: and it is the ancientest and cruellest of all the evils that doe assaile us: for tis a rebellion against all those things to which we owe obedience and a base submitting of our selves to whatsoever we ought to have any authority over.

<P>Though Divines have given as many names to Concupiscence as she hath committed sins, and that every one paints her out as he finds her in another, or according to his own experience; yet they all agree that her most celebrated name, and that which best expresseth her nature is self-love; For as Charity comprehends all vertues, self-love comprehends all vices, as <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Hi duo amo|res disti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">xerunt duas ciuitates, quorum alter sanct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> est, alter immundus, alter socialis alter privatus, alter communi vtili|tati consulens propter societa|tem, alter etiam rem communem in potestatem propriam redi|gens propter ar|rogantem domi|nationem. <HI>Aug. in lib. de Gen. ad litteram cap.</HI> 11.</NOTE> Charity unites us to God and loseth us from our selves, her Enemy self-love severs us from God, and fasteneth us to our selves; As Charity hath no great|er a passion for any thing then to love God, and make him be be|loved by all others: self-love produceth no more violent desire in man; then to love himself, and to obliege all other men to love him; To comprehend these truths you must know; that Charity accor|ding

The great Apostle, when he numbers up all faults puts it in the first <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Erunt homi|nes seipsos a|inantes cupidi, clati, superbi, parentibus non obedientes, in|grati, prodito|res, voluptatum amatores magis quam Dei. 2 <HI>Tim. cap.</HI> 3.</NOTE> rank and teacheth us that there is no sin which is not a sort of self-love disguised. And Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> who hath drawn all his Doctrine from Saint <HI>Pauls</HI> words, instructeth the whole Church that the faults which wee detest are not so much the effects as the proprieties of self love. In effect, is not Avarice, an unjust love of riches, is not Pride an unjust love of Honours, is not opiniatrecie a furious love to be always victorious, is not colour a detestable love of revenge? And to conclude all in a few words; are not all sins as many different loves which changing rather countenance then humour: agree all in a designe of fastning themselves to objects which they like, and of keeping a loofe off, from such as they like not. There is also the second opposition of the love of God, and the love of our selves, for charity hath no no|bler imployment then to free us from all things to unite us to God, she endeavours to perswade us that to love our selves well we must hate our selves; that to have a care of our selves we must forget our selves; and if we would finde out our happinesse we must seek for it from without our selves, men wonder that the law of God which commands us to love our Neighbour, doth not command us to love our selves, and that it only mentions the love we owe unto our selves when it recommends unto us the love which we owe unto, our Neighbours, but to boot that this love was imprinted in the founda|tion of our wills by the hands of Natures selfe, and that it was more then needed to command us a thing to which we had so great an in|clination; man loved himselfe sufficiently in loving <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Videtur de homine ipso ni|bil actum, sed parum dilucid&egrave; qui hoc arbitra|tur intelligit.

Self love takes a clean opposite way, from that of charity, and by direct contrary traces, endeavours to estrange man from God, and to fasten him to himselfe, or to the Creature: it effaceth as much as it is able, the inclination which his soule hath for the <HI>Summum Bo|num:</HI> if it cannot stifle it, it diverts it; and seeing that the heart of man cannot be without imployment it lays before him the beauty of the Creatures, to divert him from those of the Creatour; being accom|panied with blindnesse and pride, it easily abuseth the soule which it possesseth, and figuring out the perfections thereof more glorious then they are; it makes her, her own Idolater; it raiseth her incensi|bly up to the height of impiety, and by different steps mounts it even to the hatred of God, for as the faithful man is perfect when he loves God, even to the pitch of hating himself, the sinner even hath the measure of his sin filled up when he loves himselfe, even to the de|gree of hating God. This passion reignes not much, save in the souls of the damned: one must be wholly possest by sin to conceive this designe, and I know not whether there be any so sinful soule on Earth, as can have so damnable a recentment, Hell is the abode of these wicked ones, and I firmly believe, that as their hatred of God is the sow lest of there sins, so is it the cruellest of their punishments, yet can they not hate this <HI>Summum Bonum</HI> with there whole heart, the foundation of their being is possest by the love of God, they love him naturally whom they hate willingly, they are divided between love, and hatred; there will is <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Deus noster is est quem id omneamat quod amare potest, <HI>Origen.</HI></NOTE> parted by these two contrary mo|tions and for all they can do to stifle this naturall Inclination, they cannot hinder their best part from languishing, and sighing, after God: they afflict themselves that nature fights against there will, and that her unalterable laws forceth them to love the author of their everlasting punishment.</P>
<P>But to reassume the threed of our discourse; the last opposition of selfe love and charity is, that the latter hath no more violent desire then to purchase lovers to God almighty to enlarge the bounds of his Empire and to disperce the holy flames of his Divine love into all hearts, for a heart that is inflamed with this sacred fire knowing ve|ry

well that it cannot love God according to his lovelinesse, wisheth that all the parts of its body were changed into hearts and tongues to praise and love the only object of its love. But as she sees her wishes are uselesse, she endeavours to increase the number of Divine lovers, to the end that making amends for her indigen|cy, they may love him with all their might whom she cannot sufficiently love. Self love in opposition to this, which obligeth man to make a god of himselfe, inspires him with a desire to make himselfe be beloved of all the world. Instructed by so good a master, he imployeth all his cunning to rob himself of his liberties, he dis|covers all his perfections to purchase lovers, he proposeth himselfe unto himselfe as an Idoll to be adored, and believeth that the truest, and most legitimate happinesse on earth, is to have slaves who are fairly forced to love him. When Kings are arrived at this height of of injustice and Impiety, men thinke them happy and the Politicks, which labours to decypher a good Sovereigne, is never better con|tent, then when she hath raised in them this violent desire of enjoy|ning their Subjects good will. Tis herein that she distinguisheth Kings from Tyrants, and that she opposeth unjust Sovereignes to Legitimate Monarchies; but we are taught by Christian Religion that blame may be incurred as well by making ones self <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Dilectionem sui in illam di|lectionem Dei resert quae nul|lum &agrave; se rivu|lum extra se duci patitur cu|jus derivatione minuatur. <HI>Aug. 1 de doct.

For though she honours Kings, and condemnes Tyrants, though she approve of Moderate Government, and detests ruling by rigour, yet doth she equally blame those who intrench upon Gods rights, and who proposing themselves to their Subjects: as their final end, will possesse all their affections, love ap|pertaines aswell to God only as glory, of all offerings he is best plea|sed with that of the heart, and he loves much better to rule over men, by the way of mildnesse, then of rigour, insomuch as Kings who would make themselves be beloved as Gods, are not much lesse faulty then those who would make themselves be dreaded as Ty|rants, they are both of them guilty of Treason against the Diety, and pretend to honours which are only reserved for God, <HI>Lucifer</HI> ne|ver purposed to establish his greatnesse by violence, he made more use of his beauty then of his power, to Corrupt the inferiour Angels; and if his Empire be terminated in rigour it began in clemency.

two ways be more innocent then the other in the sight of men, it is not much lesse faulty in the sight of God, it is not permitted in our Religion for a man to make himselfe be beloved: tis a presumption to endeavour those liberties which pertain only to God, to deboysh his subjects is to divide his Empire, hee will have all his slaves to love him, and according to Saint <HI>Austines</HI> maximes, we owe all our love to God: the Prince is bound to fasten his subjects to their Cre|ator to make him reign in his kingdome, and to receive no homage from his people save only for that he is the Image of God: tis there|fore the most dangerous impression that self-love can make in men, when it perswades them that they deserve the love of the whole world, and that they ought to imploy all their might to augment the number of their Lovers: yet every one is possest with this passion, and I see none who do not by severall ways aspire to this tyranny. Men discover the perfection of their minds to make themselves ad|mired, women make the most they can of their bodily beauty to make them be adored, but the one and the other of them will have their malady turn contagious, and spread abroad the poyson of self-love which hath infected them, into the souls of all those that come neer them.</P>

did irritate his desire, and the remembrance of his past felicity made him seek for that in the Creature, which he had lost in his Creator. Self-love, which succeeded the love to God, spread it self abroad in|to three as impure rivolets, as was the spring head from whence they did derive: the first was call'd the love of Pleasure, <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">In omnibus illecebris mun|di hujus tria sant aut volup|tas aut curiosi|tas aut super|bia. <HI>Aug. in ap|pend. Serm.</HI> 1.</NOTE> the second the love of light or novelty, and the third the love of greatnesse, or of glory, these three generall causes of all our disorders, are the fatall effects of Concupiscence, they divide man (now become guilty,) and though they agree in the bereaving him of his liberty, yet they share in the division of his person. Voluptuousnesse or the love of pleasure, resides in the senses, and reigns in all the parts of the body which are capable of delight, the soul engageth her self in the eyes and ears, to tast the contentments which these two senses can wish for, she renounceth spirituall delights, to seek out such as are sen|suall, and as if she were now no longer a pure spirit, she longs after nothing but bodily delights. Necessity is no longer the rule of her desires, she betakes her self no more to objects, for that they are ne|cessary, but for that they are pleasing. Temperance useth her utmost endeavour to withstand this irregularity; she endeavours to passe by all voluptuousnesse, without any stay, and to make use of such reme|dies as Nature hath ordained for the cure of our maladies, without the engagement of her aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ctions; but Concupiscence overthrows all her designes, and by the absolute power whereby she governs in the soul, she solicits her to tast all the pleasures of our senses. The soul being faln from her first greatnesse, seems then to cease being spiri|tuall, that she may become Corporall; that she partake no longer in the felicity of Angels, and that she no longer pleased with any de|lights, save such as are sensuall, and impure. This is the first contest|ation which those faithfull ones resent, who will overcome <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Concupiscen|tia ad sentien|dum nos five consentientes mente sive re|pagnantes, ap|petitu carnalis voluptatis im|pell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t. <HI>Aug. lib. 4. cont.

If they were to chuse the Combat, they would rather charge grief then pleasure, and by their sighing under the burthen of their Irons, one may easily judge, that they are only slaves to pleasures, because they want courage to des|pise it. This Temptation is so much more dangerous then others as
<PB N="35" REF="28" MS="y">
it is more naturall. To vanquish it a man must have no more a body, and changing condition with Angels, hee must become a pure spirit; but to boot with our loving this part of our selves, the occasions of Combats are so frequent, as we are oft in one and the same day both Conquerours and conquered: the sub|jects of vain glory are not so common, if we be blinded by our ima|ginarie greatnesse, we are humbled by our reall miseries, and we must have forgotten the shame of our birth if we glory in any thing during our life: Though the desire of knowledge awakens our curi|osity, and that the very ignorance whereinto we are plunged, obli|geth us to seek out a diversion, in the knowledge of worldly things, yet the difficulties which accompanies. Science, makes us lose our longing after it. We love rather to be kept in ignorance, then to be freed therof by study, we cannot resolve upon the getting of a fleece, where the Pains exceeds the Glory, and where the Reward equals not the Labour: but Voluptuousnesse is as easie as delightfull, it pre|sents it self unsought for, and is received without difficulty, if we must fight for it, tis when Jealousie or Ambition makes themselves of the Partie; and that they Corrupt the sweetnesse of our delights by the vain-Glory of their designes, and moreover, Nature having mingled delight with all her remedies, we must always stand upon our guard, that we build not our felicity one things which she gives us only for our Consolation. It is hard to discern whether we eat more out of Pleasure, or necessity; a man must be very moderate, to seek for nothing more in sleep, then the refreshing of the body, and the repairing of our forces; we must have already made many a Com|bat, to effect nothing more in Marriage then the preservation of our Families, thus do great Saints confess tis easier to bereave ones self of Pleasures, then to regulate them, and that there goes more of worth to moderate these pleasing Enemies, then to stifle them; tis easier to fast, then to feed sparingly of dainty viands, and the good use of riches is more rare then voluntary Poverty. Mans mind is busied with Curiosity, or the love of Novelty, which is so much the more dangerous by how much it appears more lawfull: knowledge, which is not the least part of our Advantages, takes the freedome to per|swade us that there is nothing more Noble then Cognizance of Na|ture, she thinks to offer up an acceptable sacrifice to God; when she losing our senses from delight, that she may engage in the search

<HEAD>The ninth Discourse.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Wherefore Concupiscence remains in Man after Baptisme.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE are taught by Divinity, that nothing but the Power of God can make all things out of nothing; nothing but his Providence can draw good out of evill, and make a mans fault to amend his life. Naturall Phylosophy cannot compre|hend the former of these wonders, and morall Phylosopy cannot comprehend the second. Nature worketh nothing without materi|als, her workmanships are rather alterations then productions; shee may well change one thing into another, but she cannot make a new thing, and there is so little proportion between nothing and subsist|ancy, as <HI>Aristotle</HI> chose rather to believe that the World was eter|nall, then that God created it of Nothing. This great <HI>Genjus</HI> found it lesse inconvenient to acknowledge numberless causes, then to con|fess one only, the power thereof was unlimited; and morall Phy|losophy, which is not greatly more enlightned then naturall Phylo|phy, findes such opposition between good and evill, as shee would rather think to draw light out of darkness, and beauty out of defor|mity, then Vertue out of Vice: but Religion which adores in God Almighty a Power which hath no bounds, and an unclouded Pro|vidence confesseth also, that the one may have framed the World out of nothing, and that the other may have extracted Grace, out of sin, in effect the work of our Redemption, is the sequell of ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> loss. And if <HI>Adams</HI> sin be not the cause, it is at least the occasion of our salvation, the same sin which hath drawn reproches from forth our mouth, hath return'd prayses for it, And the Church calleth that sin, fortunate, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">O <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> cul|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> quae talem ac tantum meruit habere Redem|ptorem.</NOTE> which hath merited so excellent a Redeemer, Concu|piscence being the daughter of sin, we must not wonder if divine Providence hath made it serviceable to her designes, and if she em|ploy her Enemy to execute her will, for though this guilty habit be past, as it were into nature, and that it makes sin so hard to be over|come, yet did God leave it in the souls of his faithfull Ones to exer|cise their vertue, to allay their Pride, and to make them have their

Remembrance of their misfortune always before them. During the happy estate of their Innocencie, Vertue was so naturall to man as it met with no Resistance. Man took delight in doing what was good, and the greatness of Merit was not measured by the dif|ficulty of the work, his passions were obedient to reason, his senses were faithfull to his soule, and his body had no other moti|ons then those of the soule, the practise of Piety was not as yet be|come a Combate, Continencie and Fortitude were not enforced to give battaile, to bear away the victory; and these two Noble Habits were given man, rather for his ornament then for his defence, so we must confess that if he had more quiet then we, hee had less glory, and that if he tasted more delight, he could not hope for so great re|ward, for all our life is spent in Exercise and fighting, all our vertues are austeer, they are always environed with Enemies, they cannot go out of their ordinary tracks, without falling into a Precepice, and they are Reduced to the <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Vita justi in isto corpore ad|huc bellum est, nondum trium|phans.

To say truth, they run much danger but gain much Glory; the same subject which causeth their Pain heighthens their courage and in|creaseth their merit.</P>
<P>If Concupiscence be of use to vertue, she is no lesse fatall to sin, for though she be her Daughter she is likewise oft her Murtherer; and of all the remedies which Grace hath ordained to cure us of Pride, there is none more safe then that of this disorder. We are na|turally Proud and Miserable, and it is hard to say whether Pride or misery makes the greater Impression in our souls. Pride is so well engraven therein, as we in our sad Condition continue the coveting after all those greatnesses which we did possess whilest innocent; We perswade our selves that we are Princes, because our Father was

so: We will have Nature to obey us because she bore respect to his will, and we think that all honours are due to us, because he enjoyed them in the Earthly Paradice. Death which is the reward of sin can|not be the cure thereof; the Creatures revolt cannot perswade us, that we have lost the Empire of the world, and the sicknesses, which do alter our Tempers, cannot teach us that the Elements are our ene|mies, but Concupiscence teacheth us humility, this insolent Mistris teacheth us obedience; <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Quae hominis alia est major miseria nisi ad|versus eum ip|sum, inobedien|tia ejus ipsius. <HI>Aug. lib. 14&punc; de Civit. cap.</HI> 15.</NOTE> and her frequent rebellions makes us know that we are no longer Masters of our selves, by two contrary Motions, she inspires us with Pride, and teacheth us modesty, she fils us with courage, and makes us know our weaknesse, she incites us against Heaven, and obligeth us to implore the assistance thereof&punc; In fine, she wounds and cures us, at the same time; and like to those prepared poysons, whereof Medicines are made, she is the antidote of al our evils. For who is so proud a Prince as doth not humble himself, when hee sees he is less absolute in his person then his state, that his&punc; Passions are more rebellious then his subjects, that there goes more to tame them, then to reduce Rebels to obedience, and that though reason super-intend in his soul, she hath irrationall subjects who despise her Authority.

<P>THe Phylosopher <HI>Seneca</HI> being desirous to make it known, that Destiny hath no share in the Worlds Government, and that whatsoever accidents befall us in the Course of our life, are guided by a Sovereign Providence, vaunted that he had under|taken a work <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Rem saciam non difficilem causam Deorum agam. <HI>Senec.

I very well know that the unfortunate Innocent have complained of these, and that without dis-regard to the respect which is due to the Justice of God, they have often desired that God would be more speedy in his Punishments. <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">cunt in bo|nis dies suos &amp; in puncto descen|dunt in inferos <HI>Iob.</HI></NOTE> <HI>David</HI> murmured inwardly seeing the prosperity of sinners, <HI>Iob</HI> complain'd, that the good fortune of the wicked was so constant, as it accompanied them even to death, and Saint <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">August. in Psal. 72.</NOTE> <HI>Augustine,</HI> who seems to have sought into all the secrets of Divine justice confesseth, that it is no lesse difficult to accord the Power of Grace, with mans Liberty, then Divine justice with the Prosperity of the wicked. This is the scandall of silly souls, the wick|ed mans despair, and the rock whereon all those run ship wrack, who
<PB N="43" REF="32">
are not soundly grounded in the Faith of Jesus Christ: yet this great Doctor avoucheth two or three maximes, which may pacifie the mind of man, and which prove cleerly enough that there is no sinner who is not miserable.</P>
<P>To understand his Doctrine we must know that <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Omnis animae poenoe &amp; prae|mium semper aliquid consert justa pulchri|tudini disposi|tionique rerum omnium. <HI>Aug. lib. de quantit. animae, cap.</HI> 56.</NOTE> Punishment and reward go to the making up of one part of the worlds beauty; and that as Vertue deserves some Pay, sin likewise deserves some Punishment. It would be unreasonable if the just man should not be recompenced, and Irregular, if the guilty should not be punished. Divine justice is answerable to these two sorts of men, and as the great <HI>Tertullian</HI> says, she is no lesse obliged to Erect Heaven for the good, then to make Hell for the wicked; that Divine perfection, which maintains the order of the world never overthrows this: Ver|tue receiveth always her reward, and vice is never exempt from Pu|nishment; they do not only follow, but accompany one another, and as the <HI>Epicurians</HI> did not believe that delight could be seperated from vertue, Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> did not believe that Punishment could be parted from sin. This effect is always found with it's cause, and man can no sooner Commit an offence but he presently becomes sensible of the Punishment. There is an <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Lex aeterna &amp; summa ratio cui semper ob|temperandum, illa est per quam mali miseram, boni beatam vi|tam merentur, nec enim inju|stum esse potest ut mali miseri, boni beati sint. <HI>Aug. lib. 1. de lib. arbit. cap.</HI> 6</NOTE> Eternall law which will have good men happy, and the wicked miserable, it neither defers reward nor Punishment, and without putting off the Punishment to Hell, or the reward to Heaven, it confers them both on earrh,; God hath made some laws which alters with the times; though he be in himself always the same, yet he accommodates himself somtimes to his handy-worke, and oft times repeals the Decrees which he hath pronounced, but the law which regards vertue, and vice is immuta|ble, and the ugliness of an offence never goeth without the beauty of Punishment, nor doth sin ever enter into <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Nunquam accidit ut sit in anima dedecus peccati sive de|core vindicta. <HI>August.</HI></NOTE> a soul, but it brings it's reward with it, Though this maxime may appear strange yet hath it been approved of by prophane Phylosophy; and <HI>Seneca</HI> <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">In ipso etiam scelere sceleris supplicium est. <HI>Seneca.</HI></NOTE> acknow|ledged that man who had sinned could not keep unpunished; that his Crime was his Torment, and that without having recourse to the revengfull furies he bore about with him, his hangman, and his sin. They therefore deceive themselves who believe that there be any guilty unpunished, because they are honoured; for though men through base flattery confound vice with vertue, though they put a value upon what they ought to dis-esteeme, though they raise Altars
<PB N="44" REF="33">
to those that merit the Gallows, though the Heavens seem to favour their designs, that Fortune fore-running their desires, mounts them upon Thrones, and put Crowns upon their Heads, yet are they un|happy, if wicked, and amongst this imaginarie felicity which pro|vokes our Envy, they suffer Pains, which would move our Com|passion, if they were as evident as true: for if they should suffer no other Torment then to be upon ill Tearms with God, are they not sufficiently Miserable, and say they should undergo no other losse, then that of his Grace; should they not be rigorously enough pu|nisht; banisht People will admit of no Consolation, because they are far distant from their Country: though they enjoy their estate, though they live under a Temperate Climate, though they con|verse with fair conditioned men, they think themselves unhappy, in that they breath not the Air of their own Countrey. Favourites will not out-live their Masters favours, the Magnificence of their Palaces, the number of their meniall servants, the greatnesse of their offices, cannot charme their sorrow; they are pleased with no|thing because their Prince is offended: all their contentments cannot countervail the losse of his Favour, and his wrath is a Punishment, which all the reasons of Phylosophy cannot sweeten: if experience teacheth us that banishment and losse of Favour are Punishments, shall we doubt whether he that is not upon good Terms with God, be upon bad terms with himselfe or no? and can we think him happy who through his own default hath lost the well spring of true Hap|pinesse? the sinner then is miserable; and if men esteeme them hap|py amongst so many sufferings, It is for that they do not know wherein happinesse consists. I looked upon the prosperity of the wicked (saith Saint <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Vidi malos &amp; displicuit mi|hi Deus.

<P>As mans wickednesse draws on Gods justice, and as we conclude he is miserable, because sinfull, we ought also to argue that he is sin|full because miserable, for God is not severe without reason, our

Phylosophers agree in this truth, the light of reason hath made us know, that Punishment presuppo|seth sin; the Ignorance of our Miseries hath perswaded them, that man was punisht on earth, for sins that he had committed in heaven, that his body was his souls prison, and that she was deteined there to expiate the faults which she only had committed. Though these be not so pure truths but that they have an intermixture of Errour, yet they teach us that sin precedes Punishment, and that mans misery doth assuredly witness his offence. For what likely-hood is there that Divine Providence would have condemned man to so much misery without a fault, wherefore should the body rebell against the soul, whereunto it is united: Wherefore should man be compo|sed of Parts which cannot agree? and why should the workmanship of God be out of order were it not corrupred by the sin of man. We must have offended this judge, before he have condemned us, his justice <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Numquid ille prius ulcorqu&agrave;m iste peccator? absit ne&abque; enim Deus davinat in|nocentes. <HI>Aug. lib. 11. de Gen. cap.</HI> 17.</NOTE> never punisheth the Innocent, and his goodnesse would not permit us to be miserable, if we were not guilty: but we must al|so confesse that his justice would have been remisse, had he not punisht sin, <HI>Adams</HI> Rebellion deserved that all men should be pu|nisht for it, his sufferings were to be hereditarie, and there had been some sort of Inconvenience, that a guilty Father should have pro|duced innocent Children, we inherit his punishment and his sin, and receiving our being from him, it was reason we should partake of the Miseries which do accompany it, In Point of high Treason, the Children are punisht for the Fathers fault, When a Princes Anger breaks out upon great personages that are guilty, it fals likewise up|on their Families, to have any relation to them sufficeth to be guil|ty.

Our Complaints proceed from our Ignorance we defend our own cause only because we know not his Sanctity whom we have offended, if we had a little light we would prevent Gods decrees, and we should find that Hell is to small a punishment for such as rebell against him. In whatsoever sort it be that we have contracted sin, it deserveth Punishment, we cannot be blamelesse since we proceed from a guilty father, and since the bodies maladies are hereditary, we must not wonder if those of the soul be contagi|ous: there is no difference between <HI>Adams</HI> sin, and ours, save only that his is voluntary, and ours Naturall, that he is more guilty then unfortunate; &amp; we more unfortunate then guilty, that he hath done the mischiefe and we have received it, that he hath committed a fault, and we bear the Punishmnnt, that his disorder is become our Nature, that his Rebellion engageth us in disobedience, and that as the tree is lost in it's root; we are infected in our beginning and cor|rupted in our father.

<HEAD>The First Discourse.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Souls Excellencie, and of the miseries which shee hath contracted by Sinne.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_THe Church hath oft times seen the Truth of her belief gain-said by contrary Here|sies, neither hath she almost at any time explained the mysteries of faith, but that she hath seen new Sects arise, which by different ways have endeavoured to bereave her of her Purity, and to engage her in Errour, when she explained her self upon the mysterie of the Trinity, and that she had taught her Children to adore the plurality of Persons, in the Unity of the Divine Essence, she was opposed by two contrary Heresies, the one of which con|founded the Persons, the other divide the Nature, when to declare
<PB N="48" REF="35">

The Churches belief being equally distant from these two Errours, and since she doth as constantly confesse the goodnesse of nature as her corruption. I have thought good throughout all this work to min|gle Invectives with Panygericks, and to observe as well the Advan|tages which man receives from God, as the miseries which he con|tracts by sin, I therefore think my self obliged to set forth the beau|ties of the soul, before I describe her blemishes, and to paint forth on the same Table her perfections, and her defaults.</P>
<P>The souls Originall contributes to her greatnesse, and though she be brought <HI>Ex Nihilo,</HI> tis no small miracle that Divine Power hath been able to draw so excellent a thing from so barren a subject.

Imagined that soul made a part of the Divine substance that she was a slip of his being, &amp; that after having inlivened the body which served her for a sepulchre, or prison, she should be happily re-united to her <HI>Principium.</HI> Some others more modest believe, that she drew her birth from Heaven, and that preserving the memory of her dear Country, she could ill bear with the length of her exile. Some others lesse elevated have perswaded the~selves that she was form'd of earth, and that being more extenuated, &amp; not more noble then the body, she had the same Element for her Originall, the <HI>Pythagorians</HI> composed her of Numbers, and would have harmony to be her Essence, as that which maketh Peace in the world, and accordeth the Elements; some dotards have drawn her from the Atoms of the Sun, and gave her a body composed only of Light and Heat.</P>
<P>But Christian Religion teacheth us, that she is a spirit created by God in time, infused into a body to inanimate it, the spring head of Motion and Life, and that in her noblest operations, she stands in need of her salves Organes to operate withall, Light is in some sort naturall to her, in her understanding she comprehends the Principles of all Sciences; her will hath in it the seed of all vertue, the senses are so many Messengers which informe her with whatsoever passeth in the world, and by their faithfull reports teach her those truths which she was ignorant of, tis true, that there are some truths which are rather infused into her then acquired by her, and which Nature hath so powerfully imprinted in her Essence as Errours self cannot deface them, she without an Instructer knows there is but one God, she preserves this belief in the midst of Superstition, in this point she is Christian, even when Infidell whilst she offers <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Nam te quo&abque; palam &amp; tota libertate qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> non licet nobis, ita audimus pro nuntiare quod Deus dederit &amp; si Deus voluerit.

Nay, she is an Image thereof, and it seems God took pleasure, to draw his own Picture in the soul of man, and to make us admire in this chief work of his power, the unity of his Nature, and the Plu|rality of his Persons; for though this spirit be engaged <HI>In Materia,</HI> and that it works differently according to the severall Organes of the body, that it digests meat by naturall heat, converts it into bloud by means of the Liver, distributes it into all parts&punc; by the veins, and by a miraculons Metamorphosis gives a hundred severall shapes

This admirable unity agrees with a Trinity of powers, which makes the soul an excellent Image of God; for she hath an active understanding, which conceives all things, a happy memory which records them, and an absolute will, which disposeth of them; she knew the highest of our miseries by reflecting on her self, before Faith had revealed unto her the pro|cession of the Divine persons, Nature had given her some glimme|ring thereof, by studying what she found to be in her self; she learnt what was in God, and seeing that she conceived a word in her understanding, and a love in her will, she had no trouble to comprehend that the father begot a Sonne, and that the Sonne to|gether with the Father produced a Holy Ghost. <HI>Plato</HI> who had read no other book then that of his own soul, guest at these Truths. <HI>Tris|megistus</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Monas genuit Monadem &amp; in se suum reflexit ardorem. <HI>Tris|megist.</HI></NOTE> who had only learn'd these lights out of the bosome of Nature, had some weak knowledge of the mysteries, and we are bound to confess, that neither the one nor the other would ever have known the Divine Originall had they not seriously considered the copy.

then malice, &amp; if her subjects forget their duty, they are never the first Authors of disorder, the tongues diligence in expressing her thoughts exceedeth belief, the eyes makes prodigious hast to bring her news, and the ears as lazie as they are; are wonderfully faithfull, in infor|ming her of what they understand: the hands invent a thousand means to content her, the five branches whereof they are Compo|sed are the mothers of all Arts, and they are so affectionate to their Sovereign, as she hath no sooner design'd any thing but these indu|strious officers do forth-with faithfully execute it. Nature would be jealous of their labours, did she not know that their Power is bou~ded, and that for all they can do to imitate her, they can neither give life, nor motion to their workmanship, in fine, the soul which governs them so dexterously, and which seems to foregoe all the other parts of the body to inanimate them, loseth half her Power when she hath no hands, and this high and mighty Sovereign seems to exe|cute her greatest designs by the means of these faithfull confede|rates.</P>
<P>As she is absolute in her servitude, she is immortall in her grave, and all the atteints which sicknesse gives her, cannot trouble her rest, if she apprehend Pain, tis because the body that she inanimates re|sents it, if she fear death, tis because it destroys her Mansion, and if she seem <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Porr&ograve; &amp; ani|mam compati corpori! cui loeso ictibus, vulneri|bus, ulceribus condolescit, &amp; corpus animae cui afflictae cu|rae angore amore cobereseit. <HI>Ter|tul. de animae.</HI></NOTE> to be moved or affraid tis because she loves the slave that would foregoe her: the knowledge she hath of her own Immortali|ty, makes her rest quiet, she takes delight in entertaining her self with thought of the life which must succeed this life, she sees far in|to ages that are to come, she ordains things which must not be ac|complished till after her departure, she is very jealous of her honour, and knowing very well, that death which will destroy her body, shall not ruine her, she endeavours to do Actions, for which she shall suffer no reproach in the other world; her cares which extend themselves beyond the precincts of time, are proofs of her <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Nam omnibus fer&egrave; ingenita est famae post mor|tem cupido, lon|gumque est eos retexere quo|rum innumera elogia sunt con|temptae mortis propter posthu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">am. <HI>Terrul. de ani.</HI></NOTE> Im|mortality, and the Paision she hath for Glory, witnesseth that she is not ignorant of the happinesse which is prepared for her in Hea|ven, when the moment wherein she is to make her entrance there|into approacheth, and that she is ready to be divorced from her body she operates with a new strength; she sees things with more light, all her words are <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Hinc denique evenit saepe ani|ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> in ips<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> di|vortio potius a|gitari, d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> ex major<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> suggestu jam in liber<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> constituta enun|ciat quae videt, quae andit, quae incipit nosse. <HI>Tert. de animae</HI></NOTE> Oracles, it seems that freeing her self from <HI>Ma|teria,</HI> she becomes a pure spirit, and that having no further Com|merce

I should be too tedious if I would perticularize in all the souls advantages, the rest of this discourse must be imployed in shewing what out rages she receiveth from sin; for as soon as she took up her lodging, she became slave to the body; she lost her Power when she lost her Innocence, when she ceased to obey, she ceased to command, and as if obedience had been the foundation of all her greatnesse, rebel|lion was the cause of her miseries, of all the cognizances whichwere together with Grace infused into her, none remain'd in her but doubts and jealousies, which makes her as oft embrace fals-hood as truth; though she know God: she adores the workmanship of his hands, her enlightnings detein her not from engaging her self in errour, and the great Inclination which she hath for the <HI>Summum Bonum</HI> doth not estrange her from the love of perishable things, she is the Image of God; and ceaseth to resemble him, she expres|seth his greatnesse, and doth no longer imitate his vertues, she con|serves the Trinity of her power in the unity of her essence, yet can|not conceive one God in three Persons, she makes and Idol unto her self of every Creature, all that pleaseth her seem Gods unto her, her Interest is the soul of her Religion, her love ariseth from fear, she adores whatsoever she fears, and unlesse the God which she serveth had thunders wherewithall to punish her she would have no victimes to load his Altars withall.</P>
<P>Her Punishment is the Picture of her offence, she meets with re|bellion in her slave; the conspiracy of all the parts of her body is generall; her senses do seduce her, Her Passions do torment her, her Imagination troubles her, and her subjects do despise her, she sees her self obliged to encourage their disorders to give life to Rebels, which justle her Authority, to nourish up monsters which rend her in peices, and to arme souldiers which plunder her estate, but no|thing ads more unto her Pain; then the love which she bears her e|nemy, for though he prosecute her, she cannot resolve to hate him &amp; dares not make War against him without assistance from heaven: this Traitor is so full of cunning as he makes himself be beloved by her
<PB N="54" REF="40">
whom he abuseth, she is sensible of all the evils that he endures, and as if her pain arose from her love; she never ceased to suffer since she began to love him, she apprehends her slaves miseries more then her own; she fears death more then sin, she is more affraid of ruine then of falshood, and as if this inclination had changed her Nature, she desires no other good, nor dreads no other evill, then what is sen|sible: Musick charms her discontents, Pictures serve her for a diver|sion, she is pleased with smels, and the greatest part of her delights consists in what contents her senses, by a sequell as shamefull as ne|cessary, she is burnt by Feavers, pained by the Gout, weakened by sicknesse, and whatsoever hurteth her body, abaseth her cou|rage.</P>
<P>After the Injuries which she hath received from this domestick enemy, <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Nam etsicaro peccairix secun, dum quam vi|vere prohibe|mur, cujus ope|ra damnatur cancupisceeatia adversus spiri|tum, ob quam carnales notan|tur iusami&acirc;, non tamen suo nomine caro in|famis.

In <HI>Adam,</HI> sin arose from the soul, but in his Children it draws it's birth from the flesh, and in the most part of their errours, tis the senses which seduce them, Pleasures which corrupt them, sorrows which keep them, love, and passions which tyrannize over them. Thus our misfortunes drive equally from these two, and if the soul made our first father guilty, It is the body which makes his Chil|dren unfortunate; yet must we avow that the soul is the greater Delinquent in us as well as in him, for if she have no freedom to de|fend her self against Originall sin, and if necessity may excuse a misfortune which is not voluntary, she is more guilty then the bo|dy, because she commits so many faults with delight, stays not for being solicitated by the senses, and that by a blind Impetuosity, she willingly embraceth whatsoever is pleasing unto her, she ads vo|luntary sins, to sins of Nature, and will have that of her faults, some be the effects of her misfortune; and others, of her lewdness.</P>
<P>In fine, it seems that those that follow her motions endevour to exceed the sin of their birth by the sins of their life, and as if they thought it an offence to be more innocent then their Father, they strive to be more faulty then hee who committed all the sins in the world; when he made all that descended from him Crimi|nall.</P>

<HEAD>The second Discourse.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>That the soul is become slave unto the body by reason of sin.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THough the soul be the noblest part of man, yet is she not void of fault, and for any excessive praise that Prophane Phylosophy may give her, she hath naturall weaknesses which do accompany her, even in Innocency, <HI>Adams</HI> soul was en|gaged in his body, and in her Noblest operations, she needed the Organes thereof to expresse her thoughts, or execute her designs; though she were pleased with this dependancy, she ceased not to be servile: and whosoever should reduce an Angel to this condition, should take from him his glory and his liberty: she could not quit her body to go to Heaven, whethersoever her love did carry her, she must carry her host with her, and rather then to forego this pleasing Prison, she did prorogue the accomplishment of her desire. Igno|rance was in some sort naturall unto her, <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Quod enim &agrave; Deo est <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">on tam extinguitur qu&agrave;m obumbra|tur: potest au|tem obumbrari quia non est De|us, extingui non potest quia &agrave; Deo est, <HI>Tertul. de anima.</HI></NOTE> and though knowledge was infused into the soul of <HI>Adam</HI> together with Grace, we are not sure that he could have transmitted it unto his off-spring, had not the way of learning it been painfull, it would have at least been te|dious, and if labour had not been requisite, time would at least have been required to the acquiring thereof, though the Organes of the body had been well disposed, there would have been a difference in their temper, and all souls would not have had the same advantages, of Grace, which was their last perfection, would never have raised them into the rank of Angels, and whatsoever communication men might have had with those happy spirits, they could never have ar|rived at their <HI>Hierarchy.</HI></P>
<P>Though we are hereby, taught that the soul had her weaknesses in the state of Innocency, yet being Naturall they were not painful, and though they were faults, yet were they not punishments: for in this condition man knew nothing which pained him, he was satis|fied with his Advantages, and was not lesse happy though no An|gell, his nature being the meer work of God had no defaults, that which seem'd humble ceased not to be glorious; and the tye which the soul had to the body, was not a servitude though a ne|cessity, she was well pleased with her abode, and though she were of
<PB N="56" REF="41">
a more elevated Condition, then was her body, <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Certamen cor|poris &amp; animae non fuisset in illo beatae pacis loco, id est in paradiso delici|arum, si nemo peccasset. <HI>Aug. lib. 1 oper. im|perf.</HI></NOTE> the service she had from thence made her love her Quarter; the Chains wherewith they were united were so strong, as nothing but sin, could breake them, their Inclinations in the difference of their Nature, were so conformable, as whatsoever pleased the one, did not dislike the other: the body by an admirable prodigie heighthned it's self into the souls Employments without violence, and the soul deigned to sub|mit her self to the necessities of the body, without injury to her self, she found no difficulty in all she did, and if the body were not ser|viceable to her in her more noble works; yet did it not resist her therein, their contentments were Common, and as the soul was not subject to sorrow; neither did the body feel any pain. This happy Condition lasted no longer then the time of Innocency; when man once lost his righteousnesse, he lost his happinesse: and when he be|came Criminall, he became miserable, the soul went less in her great|nesses, and this living Image of the Divine Essence, saw her self brought to such misery, as may better be exprest by tears then words; nothing remain'd intire in man, and the outrages of sin dis|persed themselves into all the parts of the body, the understanding was darkned, the memory weakned, and the will depraved. In all the faculties of the soul; the soul received some prejudice in her ve|ry Essence, and evill found her out in such a condition, wherein as being <HI>Forma corporis,</HI> she was engaged in the <HI>Materia</HI> thereof, for since her offence, she her self as it were obliged to love a cruell Ty|rant, to bear with an irreconcileable Enemy, to serve a rebellious slave, and to make up all her misfortunes, reduced to that necessity, as she is not able without sorrow, to forego the Cause of all her disasters.</P>
<P>To conceive her corruption, we must of necessity comprehend her purity, and observe the Effects which Originall righteousnesse wrought in the soul: the first was, that notwithstanding her be|ing engaged in a body, she ceased not to be spirituall, her Functions made her not <HI>Animale,</HI> and though united to the body by Grace; yet was she not thereby a Prisoner, she communicated her perfecti|ons to it, and shared not in it's defects, she was free though bound; her body <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Tunc corpus non erat carcer animae ut som|niavit <HI>Pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> sed erat Tem|plum <HI>Tertul.</HI></NOTE> was her Temple, not her Prison, and the love she bore unto it did not injure her liberty, but as soon as sin had insinuated it self into the ground work of her Essence, she changed condition,
<PB N="57" REF="41" MS="y">
the chain of love which tyed her to her body, was turned to a servile ord, which bound her to her slave; her charity was turned into self-love; she forgot her greatnesse; and that she might interest her self in all the desires of her body, she lost all the qualities of her spirit, sensible things became her diversions, she delighted in no|thing but the voluptuousnesse of the senses, if she had changed nature by changing condition, she ccased to love the <HI>Summum Bo|num,</HI> and began to idolize her body, she fore-went her noble desires, for such as were infamous, and confining all her wishes, either to the affairs or pleasures <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Per amorem corporis 'anima<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> aliquomodo cor|pora scit, &amp; de|finit esse spiritus <HI>August.</HI></NOTE> of her body, she loved nothing but what was earthly and sensible.</P>
<P>They say that in the state of glory, the bodies of the blessed will become spirituall, and that losing all the feelings of their <HI>Materia,</HI> they shall only have the inclinations of the spirit, that they shall fol|low their soul without trouble, and by an unconceiveable agility they shall fly faster then the winds, or lightening, that they shall pierce the most solid things, and that being more subtill then flames of fire,; they shall penetrate even the substance, of the Heavens, they shall shine with glory, and being more radiant then the Sun, they shall fill all parts with light. but in the state of sin, the soul as|sumed the qualities of the body, her love engaged her further in the <HI>Materia,</HI> then Nature had done; she made her Prison more streight and more obscure, she lost the lights she was infused with|all, that she might see no longer but through the senses, and her Compliance with her slave did so alter her Inclinations, as reflecting upon her self; she had much ado to believe that she was yet spiritu|all. This violent, though irregular love was occasionally the cause of good, and served the soul to free her from the body, for Divine Justice (which oft times makes us find our Punishment in our faults) condemned <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Sinon peccos|set <HI>Adam,</HI> non erat expolian|dus corpore, sed supervestiendus immortalitate. <HI>Aug st lib. 6. de Genes. ad lit|ter. cap.</HI> 22.</NOTE> the soul to forego the body, as soon as she began to love it in excesse, the same sin which did unite them did by death di|vide them; their Chains grew weaker, as their affection strengthen|ed, and when the soul had most passions to retein her body, she was forced to forsake it: for when Originall righteousnesse was retreated the Elements began to mutiny, Naturall heat usurped upon the ra|dicall moisture, and all these contraries which lived in Peace, decla|red open War.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IF the understanding be not the Noblest of all the faculties of the soul, it is at least the most illustrious, it is the Sun of our soul which conveys light into the will, which guides this blind Queen, which dictates her decrees unto her, which pronounceth them for her, and which serves her for an Interpreter when she will

It is this Noble faculty likewise which appears first in man, which entertains Company, and takes the heart, and which makes it self be admired even by those that do condemne it: but though it retein so many advantages as makes it be generally esteemed of, yet hath it it's defects, and a man may easily judge by the weaknesse thereof: that as it had a great share in the sin of man, it had the like in his punishment, for to convince mans understanding, and oblige him to condemne himself, making him his own Judge, you need but set Nature and Religion before him, and let him see the shame|full spots he hath contracted by sin, in these two faithfull looking|glasses.</P>
<P>Since it's Rebellion, it is become slave unto the senses, and can|not discover truth, but by their <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Nihil est in intellectu quod|prius non suerit in sensu. <HI>Arist.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Inter medium,</HI> it is inwardly possest with ignorance; it's cruellest enemy is it's first hostesse, it carryes it's butcher in it's bosome, and though nothing be contrary unto it then errour: yet nothing is more natural, it hath much ado to rid it's hand thereof, and knowledge which promiseth to free it of Errour is not got without much labour, it's roses are mingled with thorns. Curi|osity is a Punishment, and it is disputable, whether sciences be not more troublesome then the evils whereof they cure us. Colledges are shamefull Prisons, the Masters thereof are unsufferable Tyrants, and the Scholers unfortunates innocents to learn Sciences, we lose content, and liberty, and our understanding is so out of the way as it must be made to endure a great deal of evill, before any good be done unto it, whatsoever cunning is used to make arts <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Nelentibus subintravil ig|norantia rerum <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ndarum &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">upiscentia noxia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">um qui|bus comites sub infer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ntur error &amp; dolor. <HI>Aug. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">hirid. c.</HI> 24.</NOTE> pleasing un|to us, they always cost us tears, and that we may see ignorance is na|turall unto us since we are become guilty, tis hardly driven away, but returns with ease.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="44">
But the rigour of our Punishment is the more augmented in that the understanding is enjoyned to employ unfaithfull Officers to be instructed by ignorant Masters and to be led by blind guides. In the state of Innocence, truth was written by the hand of Nature in the bottom of our soule, knowledge was thereinto infused, and was not seduced by the senses, the soul learnt nothing of them, which shee knew not before of her self, she was wise without trouble or errour, and if she made triall of her eyes or eares, 'twas rather for recreati|on, then necessity: but now Ignorance reigns in our understanding, and to overcome this Monster, we must make use of our senses which hold intelligence with it. What Victory can a Prince hope for, who employs Rebels to defend his State, or to fight against his enemies, and what good success can mans understanding hope for, which is necessitated to be instructed by Masters which are as ignorant as its self, the senses perceive but the appearances of things, their substan|ces are unknown unto them, their operations are uncertain, and they stand in need of Air or Light to be inform'd of the Truth. Tis true that the understanding examines their reports, but what judgement can one expect from one that is ignorant; what decree can a blinde Judge pronounce, who is instructed: only by corrupted witnesses? who sees not that this manner of proceeding is too severe not to be a punishment, and who will not confess that man is faulty, since he is so unhappy.</P>
<P>Those who undertake to defend him, say that the Understanding knows the Truth, by instinct, that it is knowing without Art, and that as little Birds know their Dams by the voice, the understanding discerns Truth from Falshood, and by a naturall judgement, embra|ceth the one; and rejectes the other: but to boot that it is a kind of <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Naturalium scientia ne in bestiis quidem deficit. <HI>Tertul|de anima.</HI></NOTE> Infamy to treat man as you would do beasts, and to give him an in|stinct who ought to have reason, doe we not every day see that he is deceived in his discoveries, that the chiefest of Phylosophers hath been forced to confess, that there were more glorious falshoods then truths, and more dark and obscure truths then falshoods. Hath not errour more that side with her, then her Enemy? Doth not the num|ber of those that are deceived exceed the number of the wise? and was it not requisite that God should endue us with the light of Faith, to free us from Imposturisme and Superstition.</P>

<P>Mans sin deserved punishment, and for his desire of too much knowledge he was adjudged to remain ignorant; for as a disorderly desire of greatnesse threw him head-long into misery, and as his im|moderate desire of living always made him die, his unjust thirst af|ter knowledge, made him fall into blindnesse and ignorance: We are born with this punishment, Errour is an hereditary evill as well as sin, and as all the sons of <HI>Adam</HI> are guilty, they are all ignorant.

Tis the first piece of Art the Devill useth to undo us: he blinds our under|standing, to corrupt our Will; and throws us into errour that we may fall into sin, we have two Enemies which set <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Dominus illu|minatio mea &amp; sal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> mea. <HI>Sic.</HI> Dominum i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> o|cat ut illmina|tio detra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t ig|n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rantiam &amp; s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">lu. infirmi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">a|tem. <HI>August. in Enchirid. cap.</HI> 81.</NOTE> upon us at una|wars, the ignorance of things which we ought to do, and the de|sire of what we ought to shun: these two evils draw on two others; for ignorance produceth errour: and desire sorrow.

it, we must confesse that Ignorance and weaknesse, are equally naturall to us: the first is seen in all actions, Nature, Morality, and Religion furnish us with as many proofs thereof as they give us In|structions.</P>
<P>For though Nature be not jealous of her works, though she free|ly expose all her beauties to our eyes, and that she discover unto us her rarest products, who is he that knoweth all her secrets? though the heavens be extended over our heads, who knows whereof they be Composed? though the Sun rise, and set every day, who knows his Influences, and Motions? though the earth bring forth her flow|ers under our feet, and ripens her fruit before our eyes, who knows what art it useth to give them their severall colours? who knows by what secret vertue Nature changeth earth into gold, and taking from it's impurity, gives it that glittering Lustre, which makes the finall ornament of all our workmanship? Who can comprehend how the dew congeals into pearl, how the water thickens into Chrystall, and how becomming solid, it continues still transparent? who can give a reason for these naturall Miracles, which we neglect only because they are too common? who knows why straw being so Cold as that it preserves Ice in the midst of Summer, is yet so hot as that it ripens fruit even in the midst of winter? Doth not Amber and the Load|stone make all Phylosophers wild? and these Miracles which come so neer our senses, do they not confound our understanding? we see all things, that know nothing; we have the use of the Elements, but not the knowledge of them; Whatsoever entertains our vanity, accuseth us of blindnesse, and whatsoever serves for di|version to our eyes or ears upbraids our understanding with Igno|rance.</P>
<P>Morality confirms this truth as well as Nature doth: for though she undertake to enlighten mans understanding, and to rule his will, though she boast to make man an Angell, and to take from him all the feelings of the flesh and bloud, doth she not lay open unto him his ignorance, when she instructeth him and doth she not shew that he is blind, in offering her self to be his Guide and Mistris? tis true that he may glory, that he himself hath formed her who teacheth him, and to be his Mistresses Master, since she hath no Maximes, which are not the inventions of the understanding.

<P>To so many Enemies which bereave man of the most glorious of all his Qualities, sicknesse is added; which making war upon our bo|dies, declares it openly also against our souls: for these two parts are so streightly bound together, as their good and bad are Common between, though the soul be the more Noble, yet stands she in need of the body in her chiefest operations, she must follow after that which she would avoid, borrow forces from her Enemy to fight him, and make use of the senses to reduce him to his duty. If this slaves Temper be altered by any disorder, the soul rescents it, if the bloud spring in the veins, if the vapours which arise from thence trouble the Imagination, or if a burning Feavor seize upon the brain, the soul can reason no longer, This Noble part of man fals into ex|travagancies, the confusion of species puts it in disorder, and all the wisedome thereof is turn'd to folly.</P>

Who would believe that God would have left that blemish in his workmanship, had he not been thereunto obliged by our offences, who can per|swade himself that he would have envied us these Qualities, if our fault had not deserved such a punishment, and who will not confesse that in the state of innocency, Memory and judgment were at peace together, thereby to make man perfect.</P>

When all this is done that ancient Writer had reason to say that memory was only usefull to three sorts of people; to those who did negotiate, who to the end they may not be surprized, are obliged to have always all their affairs present, to those who speak much, for it is memory that furnisheth them with acceptable things, which serve for recreation to the Company, and to those that use to lye, for that to shan the shame which accompanieth that sin, they must remember their falshoods, on the contrary the default of me|mory may be of use to us; and as wee profit by our losses wee may draw from thence three advantages; The first is not to lye, lest we be surprized in that sin. The second, not to speak much, but to keep silence, out of a happy necessity.

<P>Witnesses, that they may not be accepted against ought to have three conditions; The first to be well informed, therefore those who have seen are to be prefer'd before those that have heard, for the eye is more certain then the eare. The second that they speak truth, and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>h</HI> Multa sacta quae nomi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">us impro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">anda vi|derentur, testi|moni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> tuo ap|probata sunt: &amp; multa <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> data <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> bus, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> damna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, cum se al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ter babet species facti &amp; animus facientis. <HI>Aug. lib. 5.

The third, that they be rationall, and do so calm their passions, that neither hatred, nor love, nor hope, nor feare, may ever make them disguise the truth. Conscience hath all these three qualities, for she is well instructed of the fact, and nothing passeth in our hearts which she hath not perfect knowledge of, she knoweth our most secret thoughts, she see<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">h the end of our intentions, and not stopping at our words, knoweth the secret motions of our souls. It is easiy to cozen men who ground their judgments only upon the change of our countenances; they are abused by dissimulation, and he that can but counterfeit, may easily cozen them, but Conscience is our best Counsell, nothing is done whereof she is not aware, she assists in all our Resolutions, and this Sun which never sets, doth by her light dissipate all the darknesse of our hearts. Hence it is that she is true in all her depositions, for she speaks things as she sees them, she cannot be deceived, nor can <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>h</HI> Si honesta sunt quae facis, omnes sciant: si turpia, quid refert nemin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">m scire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">um tu scias? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> te mise|rum! si hunc contemnas te|stem. <HI>Sen.

Her Essence consists of Truth, and though she may fall into errour, the cannot fall into a lye. In fine she is so rationall, as she is not to be troubled or seduced by passion, she is a derivative of that primitive reason which we adore in God, a copy of that Divine Originall, a beam of that Sun, which is never Eclipsed, and they are so streightly joyned together as <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Quid prodest hominem falle|re &amp; Deum te|stem in corde habere. <HI>August.</HI></NOTE> Saint <HI>Au|gustine</HI> doth mix their lights, and makes but one Deposition of the Testimony of God; and of conscience. How miserable are they who set at naught so faithfull a witnesse? for what satisfaction can those men have, who want the Peace of Conscience? to what purpose doth Publique applause serve, when secret approach gives it the <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Male de no|bis actum erat, quoad multa scelera legem &amp; judicem essugi|uat, nisi in In|cum judicis ti|mor cederet. <HI>Sen. Epist</HI> 97.</NOTE> lye? what advantage can they pretend too, from the peoples approbati|on, if they condemn themselves? And what Happiness can they
<PB N="78" REF="60" MS="y">
enjoy, if whilst others praise their false Vertues, they be inforced to blame their reall sins.</P>
<P>This Faithfull witnesse is a severe Judge, which can neither be bribed by presents, nor frightned by threats; and who being all|wayes Innocent never spare the guilty. All his decrees are just, and though the guilty be his Allyes, he forbears not to condemn them. Whatsoever favour they may obtein from other Judges, they can never be absolved by this. and whilst their Mouth pleads for them, their consciences condemns them. And truly we ought to thank Di|vine Providence, for having given us this uncorruptible Judge to keep sinners within the bounds of duty: for there are faults which escape the rigour of the Law, and which being unknown are unpu|nished, <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Frenum ante p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ccatum &amp; fla<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">llum post p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ccatum.</NOTE> there are sins, which being glorious ones, are rewarded, there be some, who being Authorized despise correction, so as our condition had been very deplorable, if Conscience had not tane the place of Laws, and if she had not condemned that which men dare not blame, nor cannot Punish.</P>
<P>In fine, this Judge becomes an executioner, and after having de|nounced judgment, he himself doth execute it, he believes that if it be glorious to condemn sin, its no dishonour to punish it, whatsoe|ver tends to the defence of vertue, and pulling down of vice, seems glorious unto him, and the names of Judge and Executioner are e|qually honourable to him; True it is that he useth not this rigour, till he imploy'd his harmlesse cunning to frighten the faulty. <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Mala etiam co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">sc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">entia in solitudine an|xia est atque so|licita. <HI>Senec.

In fine, all their sweets are mingled with some sowres, they can take delight in nothing; remorse of conscience troubles their contentments, they tremble amidst their
<PB N="89" REF="60" MS="y">
Armies, they are afflicted in publick rejoycings, they languish in their best health, are poor amidst their riches, infamous amidst their honours whatsoever praises men give to their misdemeanours they tast not the sweets thereof, and this domestick executioner turns all their pleasures into punishments. In fine, it seems he hath a design to oppose the injustice of Fortune, and to rob the wicked of that glo|ry, which Fortune endevours to procure them: for Fortune honours crimes, recompenseth Murders, Crownes Parricides, and that she may weaken vertues Party, prosecutes her followers, but Conscience which hath no other interest then that of justice, punisheth sin in the Throne, <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Deum mala conscientia pungit amara sunt omnia. <HI>August.</HI></NOTE> and teacheth the guilty, that greatnesse is but a weak de|fence, against her just endeavours. Thus faults never fail of punish|ment; and though they be defended by violence disguised by cun|ning, excused by reason, or raised by falshood, they always finde their Punishments in the depth of their conscience.</P>
<P>As she punisheth the wicked: she rewardeth the good, for if the cry of the publique do not praise them according to their desert, they finde satisfaction in having done their duty; and the approba|tion of this just Judge makes them more glorious, then all the Pa|negyrick on earth, in this it is, that the happiness of the Innocent con|sists; tis this that comforts them in their afflictions, that incourageth them in their combates, and which crowns them in their victories. Their soul is a living Throne, where <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Interiora pul|chritudinis con|scientiae amat Christus. ibi vi|det, ibi amat, ibi lequitur, ibi co|ronat. <HI>Aug. iu Psalm.</HI> 44.</NOTE> Jesus Christ keeps his resi|dence; they famaliarly with him, and receive on earth the assurance of that Happinesse which is promised them in heaven.</P>
<P>Though these reasons prove sufficiently that Conscience is the punishment of the wicked; and the good mans recompence yet is it not hard to prove; that she is misled by sin, that this Counsellour is unfaithfull, that this Witnesse is corrupted; that this Judge is inter|essed; and that this Executioner is backward, and fearfull. For what advice can Conscience give us, since shee is blinde; and that the same darkness which overshading the light of the understanding, cloudes hers? how can she divert us from sin, since sin oft mixe~th his un|comelinesse with the beauties of vertue; and since there be whole in|tire Nations which approve of Incest, and excuse Parricide? How can she accuse us since she undertakes to defend us, and that being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e|duced by the senses, she strives to make whatsoever is pleasing unto them lawfull? we forme Consciences to our selves, which destroy

<P>WHatsoever advantages Humane understanding may pre|tend to have over the Faculties of the soul, it must give place to the will, and confesse that if he be the Counsel|lor she is his Mistris, for though his advices bear great credit with his Sovereign, yet is she so free, as nothing can constrein her, the reasons which convince the understanding do <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Permissum <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">it vile nefas: Quod licet, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">gratum est; quod non li|cet, acrius crit.</NOTE> not force the will, and after her officer is won, shee can defend her self, there is no in|sinuating into her favour but by sweetnesse, her consent is only won by submission. Constraint confirms her in her designs, fear rather altereth her actions then her desires, and violence which oft times makes the understanding say what it thinks not, never makes the will pleased with what it is displeased, she is free amidst Irons, and whilst the other Faculties of the soul crouch under Force or sorrow, she is still obstinate in her resolutions, and is never more free then when she seems most constrained. Her Empire is as large as her liber|ty,
<PB N="92" REF="63" MS="y">
all the parts of man do naturally owe her obedience, and even those which act out of necessity cease not to reverence her power. She effaceth out of the memory those species which she hath been trusted with, if you will except such Injuries, and displeasures, as are never to be forgotten, the will to forget a thing is sufficient to think no more thereon. She stops the understanding in all its operations; after tis convinced by the Truth, she suspends his judgment, and by an absolute Authority keeps this Judge from pronouncing Judg|ment. Though the imagination be not so indifferent, and that her fickle humour, makes her oft times start aside from her duty, yet doth she allay her storms when her Sovereign speaks, and if she have made any party in her heart, she is the first that doth dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e them, when the will commands. The passions which are as rebellious as wild, respect her authority, and if their first motions be not submit|ted to her power, tis because they are not capable of reason, when their fury is over, they return unto duty, and wonne by love, (which is their Sovereigns only sonne) they rank themselves under his Laws.

In fine, the will is so considerable, as man draws from thence his chief advanta|ges: a good wit may make his Company well liked of, Imagination may make him a good Poet, his hand may make him an industrious Artificer, but tis only will that can make an honest man: tis she that wins him the Title of vertues, <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Interest qua|lis sit voluntas <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">is, quia si perversa est per vers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s habe|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">os mot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s; si autem recta est, non solum in|culpabiles ve|ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> etiam&punc; lau|d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">. <HI>August. 14. d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t. c 6.</HI></NOTE> and Integrity, which is the souls chief ornament, is the pure work of this Noble Faculty. Notwith|standing all this, all Sciences busie themselves in ruling all the other powers of the soul, not troubling themselves with the ruling of this.

Vertue hath not charmes enough to endue her with love, and all the recompences which she can promise, are not powerfull enough to bereave her of her Liberty. Grace must come into the succour of Vertue; Morality must be assisted by Religion, to gain upon the will, for since she is become criminall nothing can bend her, she is the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rse through her advantages, her greatnesse makes her a slave, her Power makes her insolent, and her Liberty renders her a captive; she is brought into a condition wherein whatsoever heightens her merit, contributes to her misery, and she is so ill dealt with by sin, as she cannot recover her former perfect Liberty but by servitude: but to the end you may not think I exaggerate her loss in the describing it, I will shew her unto you in her greatest advantages, and will demon|strate that since <HI>Adams</HI> sin, all her perfections are prejudiciall to her.</P>
<P>As <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Bona privata quaerunt, sive sensus corporis sive facultates, animae. Sola volentas bonum publicum pro|curat.</NOTE> will is the Soveraign in man she respects the universall good, and whilest the other faculties are only busied about their own par|ticular Interests, she takes care for the welfare of her whole State. The understanding seeks only after truth, and when he thinks he hath found it out, he leaves further pursut. Memory labours only after the reteyning of those species which are committed to her fidelity, and when she hath acquitted her self thereof, she thinks she hath done her duty. The imaginations only care is to entertain commerce between the senses and the understanding; the senses have no imployments but to consider objects, and to give there opi|nion thereof to the imagination, the passions themselves, which are the motions of love, have their exercises limited; desire goes inquest after things which are absent, or a far off, Fear drives away dangers which threaten us, hope flatters us by her promises, Audacitie assails Enemies that injure us, and choller furnisheth us with weapons to fight, but the will is like a Queen in the midst of her State, who rules all these disorders, and remedies all that is faulty; she listens to what the senses say, calmes the fury of the imagination, appeaseth

the passions tumults, gives ear to what the understanding counsel|leth, and from the Throne where she sits, gives out orders, and pro|nounceth decrees. When she is peremptory in what she says, she is always obeyed, her power (as in God) is Composed of her will, and so long as she is not divided between her body and her understand|ing, she seldom undertakes any thing which she brings not to effect.</P>
<P>The supream Authority, is doubtlesse one of the wills chiefest Advantages, and the generall care which she takes of the guidance of all the other Faculties of the soul; is an excellent proof of her worthinesse; but who sees not that this eminent greatnesse, is ac|companied with extream misery, since she that can do all seeth no|thing, and that she who is so <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Coeca volun|tas, coecus ejus amor, coecum ejus regimen, nec mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">um si inter tot tene|bras aberret homo.</NOTE> absolute; is blinde, for she discernes Truth only through borrowed eyes: she must ask counsell of the understanding upon the advice of this faithles officer, she must exa|mine reports made by the senses, stop the violence of passions and as|swage the fury of the imaginations. Objects corrupt the senses, The passions suffer themselves to be guided by the imagination, The un|derstanding is perverted by opinion, &amp; this blinde Queen amongst so many mutinous Subjects, and so many interressed advices, knows not what resolution to put on, neither to what object to fasten her self. imagine the miserable condition of a Prince, who being blinde should have a great State to govern, Provinces to rule, Enemies to fight with, Subjects to guide, Treaties to conclude, Rebels to punish, and who to effect all this, should have none but interessed Officers, or ig|norant Counsellors. This is the deplorable condition of the will; she hath a Dominion which though it be inclosed within man, ceaseth not to be larger then the whole World; she hath passions which are wilder then Tygers, shee hath intestine seditions, and wars abroad; she hath rebellious Subjects to suppresse, secret Traitors <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Amor meus pondus meum, eo feror quocun|que ferer. <HI>August. Conf.</HI></NOTE> to disco|ver, corrupt Judges to reform, and amongst so many disorders, she hath but a weak instinct, which supplying her ignorance, indues her with aversion to what is evill, and with Inclination, to what is good.</P>
<P>But some may say, I make Monsters to destroy them, that I make the evill worse then it is to have the pleasure of curing it: for in the state of Innocency, the will was blind, yet was not unhappy; she was led by nothing but instinct, and went not astray, she took her
<PB N="95" REF="64">
light from the senses, and her Counsels from the Understanding, and yet did not this necessity make her miserable? Tis true she is na|turally blind, and that it is as much out of her power to know the truth, as for the understanding to love vertue, but she was assured of her officers fidelity, the senses were not unfaithfull, nor the Passions wild, the imagination was not troubled, nor the under|standing darkned, shee lived in a peaceable condition, she neither feared her Enemies, nor distrusted her Subjects, but now she is shie of them all; the senses will deceive her, the Passions revolt, her Ima|gination is confounded, the understanding goes about to corrupt her, and amidst so many disorders, she hath but a weak inclination to Good, which to say truth, doth never abandon her. We must more|over confesse that this inclination is much weakened by sin, and that it is a kind of Miracle if it be not corrupted.</P>
<P>The <HI>Summum Bonum</HI> is so Excellent, as he cannot be known, with|out being beloved, as soon as he suffers himself to be understood, he makes himself be desired, nor can the will be so depraved, but that she must alwayes reserve some love for so ravishing an object. The Angels find their happinesse in possessing him, and the Devils their misfortune in losing him, they cannot chuse but wish him, and how maliciously so ever their will be bent, it always languisheth after the <HI>Summum Bonum.</HI> If they could be without love; they would be without sorrow, nor would they be sensible of their losse, could they suffer it without sorrow. Yet this inclination is rather naturall then voluntary, tis rather grounded in their being, then in their Li|berty, and tis rather a mark of the goodnesse of their Nature, then of their good will, If they naturally love God, they hate him freely, though they desire him they detest him, and though their Inclinati|on be forced, their aversion is voluntary. Thus we see that the wills instinct is not so constantly set upon Good, but that it may be taken off, and experience teacheth us that since the corruption of sin, man is more inclined to vice then vertue. <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Gratia one|ri est, ultio in quaestu habetur. Quidam quo plus debent, ma|gis oderunt.</NOTE> We are much more prone to revenge an Injury, then to acknowledge a good turn; We remember an affront better then a favour, we write good offices done in sand or water, but ingrave ill ones in Brasse or Marble; Whole ages are re|quired to efface an offence, but an obligation is forgotten in a mo|ment.

In assisting a Friend we are weak, all things seem difficult unto us, what he demands appears un|just, and when once he is become necessitous, we esteem him too importunate.

It is easie to discover by his writings, that the greatest part of the Pagans good works were sinfull, since he attributes criminall Intentions to Actions which appear innocent.

<HEAD>The ninth Discourse.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>That the Will to be able to do good must be set free from the servitude of sin, by the Grace of Iesus Christ.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe Passion which all men have for the preservation of their Liberty, is no weak proof of the Excellency thereof: there be but few who do not prefer it before life, and do not ra|ther love an honourable death, then a shamefull <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Servitus obe|dientia est fra|cti animi &amp; abjecti, arbi|trio carentis suo.</NOTE> servitude, all re|volts have had no other pretexts, and Conquerors have only been odious because they have intrencht upon the Publique Liberty, we suspect their Vertues because they bear with them some shadow of Tyranny, and men have hardly believed, that they were very just, who would Command over free people; yet man hath no advan|tage which he oftner loseth then his Liberty: he becomes a slave without a Master, and finds servitude as well in a Republique as in a Monarchy, he hath not the use of this perfection, till a long time af|ter
<PB N="98" REF="66">
he be be born; he lives when he is not at liberty, and he who ought to command the whole world begins his life in slavery. Na|ture <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Sit datum liberum arbi|trium humanae naturae ut eam tamen necesse sit vivere sub potestate melio|ris. <HI>August</HI></NOTE> gives him Kings in his Parents, and if death take them away, the laws appoint him Tutors which supply the place of Masters, in his minority he is a slave, and wanting wisedome to govern himself, he is not suffered to dispose of himself: the better part of his life is spent in servitude, and unlesse he have permission from the Prince, he must be 25 years old before he can dispose of his goods.</P>
<P>When this age puts him in possession of his principall advantage, enemies arise, who clap <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Sibi servire gravissima ser|vitus est. <HI>Senec. Praefat lib. 3. Quae. Natur.</HI></NOTE> Irons upon him, for the passions are Im|perious Mistresses, who intrench upon our Liberty, and which ma|king use either of fair or foul means, makes man do a thousand things unworthy of his condition, he sometimes breaks his Chains, but forgeth new ones himself, and he thinks he is free, because he is the Author of his own servitude: If he calm his passions, and amidst their quiet recover his Liberty, he cannot defend himself from a pleasing Enemy, which deprives him of the use thereof, for sleep which pre|serves our life bereaves us of our Liberty, his poppies which sweeten our vexations, and inchant our sorrows take from us the disposall of our will: We are not at Liberty when we sleep, and as the good acti|ons which we do in that estate cannot expect recompence; so neither ought our bad ones to fear punishment.</P>
<P>Thus Liberty is a Treasure which we are oft robbed of, tis a Good which we are not always Masters of: and if rest be reasons Grave, tis also Liberties Sepulchre; tis true that it restores us what it had taken from us, and the same awaking which delivers us from death, frees us from servitude, but we make tryall of a Tyrant, who treateth us much more rigorously then doth sleep, for when sin hath possest it self of our Liberty, it never makes restitution: Our slavery ends not with our lives, we are born &amp; dye slaves thereunto. There is nothing but the Grace of Jesus Christ which can free us from the Tyranny thereof. It enters into our soulby our body, and gives us death whe~ our Parents give us life, and penetrating even into our <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Arbitrium voluntatis tunc est vere libe|rum, cum vi|tiis peccatisque non servit&punc; Tale datum est &agrave; Deo, quod amissum proprio vitio, nisi &agrave; quo dari potuit reddi non potest. <HI>Aug. lib. 14. de C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">it. cap.</HI> 14.</NOTE> will sets there the Characters of its usurpation, and of our servitude Reason is too weak a succour to defend us against so powerfu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">l an Enemy, and Prophane Phylosophy is not a sufficient remedy to cure us of so dangerousa Malady; Wee cannot drive away sin but by help from Heaven, nor can we recover perfect Liberty but by the servitude of

<P>To understand this truth (which is Saint <HI>Austins</HI> very Doctrine) we must know that in our belief, Piety was never parted from Morality, and that to be vertuous, a man must always have been Faithfull. The will was created together with grace, they both contributed unto merit, and when they were once divided, sin seized upon the will, and man operates by this mischeivous principle, all his actions be|gan to be criminall, proposing no other end but himself unto him|self, he strayed from the latter, (from grace) and looking upon the creature forbore looking upon the <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Non est igitur Gratia Dei in Natura liberi arbitrii, quia &amp; liberum arbi|trium ad diligen dum <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> eum pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">i peccati gra|ditate perdidi|mus. <HI>August.

<P>After having discovered the nature of his sicknes, we must finde out the cause, and seek by what excesse he hath faln into this Mis|fortune, Physicians oft-times judge of the quality of sicknes, by its originall, and the disorder from whence it arose, makes them finde out a cure for it. Man lost his liberty only for loving it too much, he is become a slave only because he would be too free, and he hurld himself into a miserable servitude, only for that he desired to shun a Glorious one.

<P>Tis a great misfortune, to be born in sin, and to have received bad Inclinations, before we knew them, tis a deplorable condition to be the Object of Gods Anger, before we have provoked him, and to be born away to mischief, before we were able to make resistance; but this misfortune is much the greater, when man joys Custom to Nature, when to those bad Inclinations which he inherits from his Parents, he adds many actuall sins, which forms an Imperious Ha|bit, which ingageth him in evill.

the one in being born in sin, we acquire the other by living in sin, and these two joyned together, strengthen Concupiscence, establish the Tyranny thereof and bereaves us of hope of destroying it.</P>
<P>For if the will be not strong enough to oppose the unrulinesse of Nature, how can she suppresse the disorders of a bad habit; and if the assistance of Grace be absolutely necessary for her, to free her self from naturall miseries, what kind of assistance stands she in need of to acquit her self of her acquired miseries. Tis the difficulty which makes sinners despair, tis upon this occasion that they find that irre|gular Inclinations, do never more rebell against their will, then when they have borrowed new force from a bad Custome, and the best advice that can be given them is, by their diligence to prevent so o|pinionated an Evill, and to set upon their passions in their birth, lest being assisted by Habit, they grow to head-strong, as to be unsup|pressible.

<P>In the second Place, corrupt Nature presupposeth but one sin, though <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Ex peccato est omnis mal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> consue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ndo, &amp; ad peccatum i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">linat. <HI>Aug.</HI></NOTE> it were a great one, yet was it but one, and though it gave against al the perfections of God, yet was it committed in a moment; Repentance came quickly in the Place thereof, and when once <HI>Adam</HI> felt the Punishment of his sin, he was sorry for it, his Tears appea|sed Divine Justice, the sentence of his death was deferred, and he had time granted him to people the world, to instruct his Children, and to bewail his sins: the disorders which we find in our soul and in our body, are only the effects of this fault, and when we are first born we are only capable of of this offence; Incensed Heaven can impute nothing to us but our first Fathers disobedience, and what|soever Punishment it inflicteth upon us, we have always this excuse, that we are more unfortunate then faulty: but an ill Habit is a ba|stard

<P>In the third place, nature is somewhat ashamed of sin, this unlucky Guest hath not so throughly corrupted all her inclinations, but that some shamefastnes remains which may serve her for a bridle in her licentousnesse, and which obligeth her to seek out solitary places wherein to conceal her debaucheries; if she be wicked enough to scoffe at the remorse of conscience, she is not sufficiently affronted to bear with her neighbours reproaches; if she despise punishment she apprehends confusion, and if she fear not the losse of life, she fears the losse of Honour. <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Peccata qua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">vis ma|gna &amp; borrenda cum in consue|tudinem vene|rint, aut parv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> au<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> nulla cre|duntur, usque adeo ut non so|lum non occul|tanda, verum etiam praedican|da diffamanda|qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> videantu. <HI>August.

Hence it is that shameles people glory in their loves, that lost women number up their gallants, &amp; that affronted men, cal their debaucheries good fortunes. Glorious names are invented to honour sin, Thrones, and altars are erected to it, and solicited by this evil habit which rules in the soul, such honours are given thereunto as belong only to vertue.</P>

For though the Sa|craments be ordeined to destroy sin, and that Baptisme and repent|ance do break our Irons and set us at Liberty; yet doth not their power extend to evil habits; they take away the blame and reconcile us to God, but they leave this languishing which weakens Nature, and do not Efface those Maligne Impressions which sin hath made in our soul, they leave us our bad <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Tenent pravae consuetudines quem semel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e|perant, atque quotidie durio|res existunt, &amp; non nisi cum peccatoris vit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">iuntur. <HI>Gre|gor.

The Sacraments which shed so many Graces into our souls, make us not victorious at the first, that very Sacra|ment which unites us so straightly to the Son of God, as our souls seem thereby to be mixed together with his, doth not overthrow bad habits: as long as we carry them in our bosomes, we have desires of revenge, and ambitious thoughts, the presence thereof which cha|seth away Devils, doth not chase away our irregular inclinations; these Monsters give not place to Divine Power, and our will is divi|ded between the motions of Grace, and those of concupiscence, it is troubled that since it carries about with it its Saviour, it is not yet at liberty; It wonders that whil'st it conceives humble thoughts, it hath yet sometouches of pride, that having no more sin, it yet resents the Effects thereof; that being one of Jesus Christs Subjects, tis yet under the slavery of the Devil, and that tasting the pleasures of Pa|radise, it feels notwithstanding the punishment of Hell: these dis|orders

<P>Habit and custome are of the same Nature: that which the one doth in estates, the other doth in souls, their wiles are alike, and as they are established by cunning, they are preserved by violence, their <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Gravissimum est Imperium consuetudinis <HI>Senec. in Pro|verb.</HI></NOTE> beginnings are undiscernable, and they are so weak in their birth, as they are despisable, they grow without making much noise, and esta|blish their authority without any great pompe. There is nothing more pleasing at first sight; they are so plyant as they suit them|selves toall our desires; they are so shamefac't as they play least in sight: they seek pretences to make their designs be approved of, and in all their undertakings they lean either upon reason or example: they flatter their enemies that they may undo them, and hiding their malice under an appearing mildnesse, they are in a posture of defence before any one thinks to set upon them: but when they are once esta|blisht, <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Dismit esse remedio Iocus, ubi quae suerant vitia, mores sunt. <HI>Senec.

<P>But that which is more deplorable in this condition is, that man who is possest with an ill Habit, is no longer capable of deliberation in his Actions: he follows the Tyrant that inslaves him, he thinks he is bound to defend him, because he hath assisted to set him up; he believes he enjoys Liberty, because he loves servitude; and not con|sidering the evils which threaten him, he with contentment suffers himself to be guided by his Enemy: when he is surprized by any Action, <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">In repentinis agimus ex babi|tu. <HI>Aristoteles.</HI></NOTE> he hath not leasure to argue the case; his usurper prevenes

For the Ty|rant which possesseth them is alwaies in action: he is in the will, as in his throne; from thence he gives out his orders to all the faculties of the soul, and parts of the body; the understanding conceiveth onely such thoughts as are pleasing to him, the memory is onely im|ployed about such species as he forms there, The imagination is full onely of such Phantasmes, as he doth there imprint, the senses act not but by his guidance, and the whole man is so under his power, as he undertakes nothing but by his motions. This unfortunate condision is more common then men think, for all unbeleevers are reduced into it, and wanting true vertues wherewithall to resist the evil inclinations of nature, those inclinations must needs be changed into bad habits; the greatest part of Christians are herein likewise ingaged, for not making good use of grace to suppresse the disorders of concupiscence: they finde themselves as subjected to their wicked customes, and are no longer able to defend themselves against these domestick <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Diffi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ile est peccati consue|tudinem vince|re: pravus usus vix aboletur: affidua consue|tudo vitium i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> naturam con|vertit.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>_IF a man may use Civility in combating, and if the Fury of War keep not men from treating their enemies with respect, I think I may be permitted to handle the vertue of the Pagans with esteem, and to make the Panegyrick thereof, before I make it's processe, for though I hold with Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> that their chiefest vertues have their defects, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Omnis infide|lium vita pec|catum est, &amp; ni|hil est bonum si|ne summo bono, ubi, enim d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">est agnitio aternae, &amp; incommuta|bilis aternitatis, falsa virtus est etiam in bonis operibus, <HI>Sent. 106.

<PB N="110" REF="72">
which tyrannized over their wil, was the soul of all their designs, I cannot imagine how so fatall a cause could produce such gallant ef|fects, and I wonder that the desire of Glory hath been powerfull e|nough to make them overcome Pain, and despise pleasure. The Ambition of Command, hath made almost as many Martyrs in the Romane Common Wealth, as Charity hath done in the Christian Church; and all those Glorious Saints whose lives we read with ad|miration, have suffered no more for the defence of Religion, than those first Romans did for the defence of their Liberty: her Sena|tors and Consuls were a long time Corruption-proof. The Gene|rals of their Armies did subdue their passions as well as their ene|mies, the greatest danger could never abate their courage, they were most famous when most miserable, and <HI>Romes</HI> greatnesse never shone brighter, than in adverse Fortune. Worth was not confined to the most illustrious Subjects of that Common Wealth: the peo|ple were obedient, as long as the Senate was modest; Particular Families preserved their Innocency, whilst Publique persons preser|ved justice; Wives were chast, whilest their Husbands were valiant; the Vestals kept their Virginity, whilest the Priests kept their Reli|gion; all these actions which have so fair an appearance, had no o|ther Principle then Vertue, and Vertue had no other Force then what she drew from Glory or Eloquence; she was praised by the mouth of Orators; Every Philosopher was her Panegyrick, and hardly could you read their works without being passionate for her, who was their onely Subject: She is so well set forth in <HI>Seneca's</HI> wri|tings, as one could not see her there, but they must reverence her; And he being the man that speaks the most worthily of her, I think I am bound to borrow his words to make her Panegyrick: List|en then to what he writes of her in divers parts of his book.</P>
<P>Vertue hath this of advantage that she is Noble and easie; her Noblenesse gives her value amongst men, <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Quid enim quiete animi o|tiosus? quid ira laboriosius? quid clementia re|missius? quid crudelitate ne|gotiosius? vacat pudicitia, libido occupatissima est.

<P>Let her put on what disguise she will, she is always pleasing, be it that she withstands vice, that she melt into sweat or tears, that dust and bloud ternish her Lustre, that fasting, and sufferance pull her cheeks down, she hath still beauty enough to keep her Lovers, the faithfullest whereof love her as well in open field, as in Towns, and the Lustre which she borroweth from Apparel, or Palaces, doth not heighten her merit. <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Non habet unde accipiat injuriam.

When this Tyrant seeth that he is abandoned he hath no better way to reduce his slave under his Laws, than to take upon him the Semblance of Vertue; and to bor|row his Enemies beauties to cover his own il-favour'dnesse. This disguise is vertues highest praise, 'tis the greatest advantage she can

<P>Tis in fine the greatest advantage that man can possesse: All of good <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Proprium hominis bonum virtus &amp; ratio. <HI>Sen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI></NOTE> that Avarice or Ambition do promise him, are but disguised evils. Riches are but a little earth, on which the Sun hath set a price by giving it a colour. Glory which the Ambitious do so much Ido|latrize, is but a little smoake, and the pleasure which the Voluptu|ous seek after, is but the Felicity of Beasts: but vertue is a solid good, who ever possesseth her may vaunt to have in her immortall riches, true Honours, and innocent delights. Tis the way which Nature teacheth us to mount to Heaven by; the means which she furnish|eth us with all, to make our selves like God, without sin, and of so many things which we seek after, there is none but Vertue which can procure us that happinesse. We ought not to hope for riches, since <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">m Deo pecunia non fa|ciet: Deus nihil habet, Praetex|ta non faciet: Deus nudus est.

Tis not in fine in the Number of our Followers that our Felicity consists, since God lived without Subjects before he made the world, and that of as many happy spi|rits that do wait upon him, there was not any one neer him before the Creation of the Universe. His Glory wholly consists in his own greatnesse, and without heightening himself by the Splendor of his workmanship, or number of his slaves, he finds his happinesse in his Essence. Thus Vertue is the proper good of man: he is rich enough if he be vertuous, he despiseth the praises of the world, and finds himself satisfied with the Testimony of his Conscience; he seeks for no other pleasure than what he finds in doing his duty, and as God would not cease to be happy though he should ruin the world, the wise man would not cease to be content, if though he lost his fa|mily, he preserved his vertue, he needs not care for his body, though

This great Princesse is so high spirited as she cannot tolerate a rivall, she is angry when she is sought after, for the pleasure which doth accompanie her, and likes not such lovers, as only serve her that they may by her reap profit or Glory. She will be her self the recompence of their labours, and though she promiseth them innocent content|ments, and true riches, she will be the onely motive of their search. Her beauty well deserves this respect, and he is yet ignorant of her worth, who loves her onely out of Interest: We must never ask what she promiseth us, since she gives us her self. We must not looke upon her hands, but upon her countenance, nor must we consider her fa|vours, but her desert, she is lovely enough though she appear with|out ornaments, glorious enough though without a Train, sufficient|ly magnificent though without splendor, and liberall enough, though she promise us nothing when she cals us. If there go courage to fight|ing under her Banners, there goes glory to dye in her quarrell, and as souldiers love that <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Indue magni viri animum: cape quantam debes virtutis pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">cherrimae ac magnificentissi|mae speciem, quae nobis non sertis, sed sudore, &amp; sanguine colen|da est. <HI>Senec, Epist.</HI> 67.</NOTE> Prince for whom they will powre out their bloud and glory in the hurts they receive in his service; Wise men love that Vertue for which they lose their lives, and Glory in the outra|ges which they receive in her defence, their minds are not altereed by ill successe, when their souls issue forth by their wounds, they by their mouth publish her praises, and having been her servants, they rejoyce to be her Martyrs.</P>
<P>Her beauty doth well deserve this Fidelity, for in whatsoeve con|dition we shall consider her, she is so full of allurements, as he who hath a heart must love her.

<HEAD>The second Discourse.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>That Morall Vertue hath her faults.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS night never looks more gastly than when it succeeds a fair day; as a Tempest is never more hideous than when it surpri|zeth the Marriners after a long calm, and as uglinesse is ne|ver more deformed tahn when it approaches neer Beauty: I thought the best way to make the vanity of Morall Vertue appear, was to op|pose it to Christian Vertue, and to set forth in the same Picture the ones defects, and the others perfections. This harmlesse piece of cunning will suffice to disabuse such Christians as will heighten Pa|ganisme, to the prejudice of our Religion, and who prefer the Con|stancy of their <HI>Socratesses</HI> and <HI>Catoes</HI> before our <HI>Ignatii</HI> and <HI>Laurentii.</HI></P>
<P>That which I think may have deceived them is nothing else but the <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Saepe reperitur simplicitas ve|ridica, &amp; fal|sitas composita quae hominem suis erroribus illicit, per lin|guae ornamenta laqueos dulces aspergit. <HI>Isidor. 3. de summo bono.</HI></NOTE> Lustre, which humane Eloquence hath put upon Pagan Ver|tue: for we must confesse that <HI>Plato</HI> hath much better illustrated <HI>So|crates</HI> his Innocence, than Saint <HI>Basill,</HI> or Saint <HI>Gregory</HI> of <HI>Nazianzen</HI> have done that of <HI>Abell</HI> and of <HI>Iob: Titus-Livius</HI> paints out <HI>Lu|cretia's</HI> Chastity in better colours, than doth Saint <HI>Ambrose</HI> the like of the Christian Virgins, and <HI>Seneca</HI> doth much more handsomly commend <HI>Cato's</HI> courage, than Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> doth the courage of the Martyrs. Christian Eloquence is uncompounded; she is modest in her praises, she is ashamed to make use of a falshood to heighten a Truth, and to honour a Vertue by an Hyperbole; she attributes the Saints constancy, to the grace of Jesus Christ, she lessens our admiration by discovering the causes of their patience, and we won|der not that Saint <HI>Agnesse</HI> and Saint <HI>Cecilie</HI> have overcome their tor|ments, when we consider they were assisted by Angels, and that the wild beasts did reverence their Innocency. Christians having all|ways
<PB N="116" REF="75">
been more carefull of doing well than of saying well, the best of their <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Virtutes ba|benti magna virtus est <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> glo|riam. <HI>Aug. lib 5 de Civit. c.</HI> 6.</NOTE> actions have been buried in oblivion; their vertue not ha|ving received so much Glory, hath not thrown abroad such a Lustre; and wanting Orators to speak in her praise, or Panegyricks, she hath oft-times mist Admirors: but the vertue of the Pagans hath had all prophane Eloquence exercised in the praises thereof, and all the most famous Orators busied in composing of Panegyricks to her; She hath made the best ancient Poets sweate; <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> are but skilfull ingravers, or able Painters, who have endevoured to re|present unto us rather the mind, then the visage of their Heroes.</P>
<P>Yet for all the care they have had to disguise Vertues defects, they may be discovered, if attentively considered: for Philosophers who have defined her, have placed her in a certain <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Est virtus habitus animi judicio suscep|tus, in medio|critate positus, sic que defini|tus ut pruden|tia praescrip|serit. <HI>Aristot. lib. 1 Ethic. c.</HI> 6.</NOTE> Mediocrity, which takes from her the Liberty of operating, she is environed by two Enemies which will not suffer her to enlarge her self; if she will exalt her self, she fals into a precepice, and if she endevour to do somewhat towards the acquiring of Glory; Humane weaknesse which cannot suffer it, doth condemn it as a sin. This languishing vertue is shackled, and dares undertake nothing of generous, least starting from out the Common road, she be accused of straying: she is inforced to follow the ordinary Track, and to submit her self to the rules which are prescribed unto her, if she will preserve her reputation: Liberality can do nothing of profuse wherein she may not be accused of prodigality. <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Simplicitas <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">c liberalitas nisi adsit modus in exitium ver. tuntur. <HI>Ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t. histor. lib.</HI> 3.</NOTE> A Prince dares not be magnificent for fear of being thought too bad a husband. Men with-hold their liberall humours through unjust Maximes, and keep him from following Nature in her Profusions, because some Monarchs have been known, who after having indiscreetly emptied their Coffers, have unjustly filled them again: to keep him within his duty, men shew unto him, that Ambition oft enters into the souls of Kings under the name of Liberality, that there are few who know how to dispense their fa|vours, and many that know how to lose them. Thus Princes can|not make use of Liberality; and though the Heavens have given them so great Territory, they must temper Avarice by Prodigality to acquire the title of Liberall.</P>
<P>Valour is under the same constraint, this generous vertue receives dayly a hundred advises, which under pretence of her preservation, have a design to put a period to her conquests; if she expose her self
<PB N="117" REF="75">
to danger, she is esteemed rash; if relying upon her good fortune, she put on such resolutions as fear approves not off, she is accused of Im|prudencie; yet should she beleeve her advice, she should never do any thing of generous: and had <HI>Caesars</HI> and <HI>Alexanders</HI> valour been limit|ed within the bounds of fear, they had never fought, nor been vi|ctorious; upon some occasions wisdom must give way to fortune, and Conquerours must rather consult with their good fortune than with their duties, The most glorious vertues ought to be free, they are too couragious to live inthrald, they are but the most Common ones that Subject themselves to these Lawes, they must dispense with ordina|ry rules, if they will attempt any thing worthy of memory. Poets knew this very well; for they have been enforced to invent heroick vertues, and to indue their Heroes with a valour, which raised it self above wisdom, and which in the greatest perils advised only with courage, <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Sicut heroes natura homines superabant ita virtute, erant enim inter ho|mines &amp; Deos medii, corumque virtutes modum communem ex|cedebant. <HI>Arist.</HI></NOTE> weak spirits terme it a fortunate rashnes, but the wisest Phi|losophers call it an Heroick valour.</P>
<P>Now Christian vertue is happily affranchised from this shamefull mediocrity, w^c^h weakens moral vertue: for being more Divine than hu|mane, she is not stopt by weak maximes, nothing seems impossible to her, she suffers her self to be led on by the spirit, which in-ani|mates her, and wholly throwing her self upon the Providence which guideth her, she neither considers her strength nor yet her weaknesse; hence it is that the Saints forgo all their wealth, that without caring for what is to come, they voluntarily become poor, and leave the care of their subsistence to him who governs them. Virgins who by their age and sex ought to be timorous, have sought out Tyrants, and provoked their Executioners: they thought it was a kinde of slacknesse to waite for wilde beasts; they irritated their fu|ry, they desired to loose their lives for the glory of Jesus Christ, who inspired them with a sanctified rashnesse; the love which we are bound to bear unto our Enemies, doth much exceed the rules of dis|cretion, <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Amicos dili|gere omnium est, inimicos au|tem solor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">m Christianorum, ita enim disci|plina jubemur diligere inimi|cos, u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> haec sit perfecta &amp; pro|pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">a bonitas, non communis, <HI>Tertul. ad Scap.</HI></NOTE> which forbids us to trust in a man who hath deceived us; and all Christian vertues are so Noble, that there is not any one of them whose perfection doth not consist in excesse.</P>
<P>Though she be gotten to this high pitch, she ceaseth not to be easie, which is the second Advantage which she hath over morall vertue, whose whole worth consists, in the difficulty which accom|panieth her; she would not be beautifull were she not difficult, and seeing that humane mindes betake themselves onely to what is pain|full,
<PB N="118" REF="76">
she endeavours to heighten her desert by Labour; she decks her self with thornes in stead of flowers, covers her self with dust, in stead of sweet powders, drops sweat and bloud, in stead of perfumes, and promiseth such as court her, nothing but disasters and ill luck; she is lodged upon a hill which is smooth, slippery, and steep on all sides, where a man cannot come at her without danger of falling into a precipice; though she promise honour to such as love her, she suffers them oft times to be confounded, and judgeth onely of their love, by misprising glory or pleasure. Shee invites them by her discourse, but endues them not with strength; she perswades their understandings, but doth not raise up their wills: and like the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> she may well have some light, but no heat: <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Infidelium virtus idolum est cujus species jucunda quidem sed virtus ina|nis.</NOTE> This is the cause why her pertakers have faln into despair, and after having a long time served this rigorous Mistris, they have been forced to accuse her of ingrati|tude, and to blame her cruelty; but what could they hope for from an idol, which being the workmanship of their mindes, had no other perfections than what it had borrowed from their praises, which was onely vigorous in their writings, only beautiful in their Panegy|ricks, and which was not generous, save in their actions. Thus had <HI>Cato</HI> recourse to despaire, finding no relief in vertue; and <HI>Brutus</HI> ac|knowledged when he died, that she could not assist such as served her, that she dazled mens eyes by a false light, and that she was but a vain idol, which forsook her followers at a pinch, not being able to warrant them from the outrages of Fortune.</P>
<P>We may truly affirm there have been two sorts of idolaters in the world; the one worshipped the workmanship of their own hands, <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Sicut Natio|nes manibus ita Haeretici &amp; Philosophi ver|bis, idola fabri|cantur. <HI>Tertul. advers. Prax.</HI></NOTE> and by an Immense folly put their hope in images which they themselves were Authors off; though they cannot understand them, they serve them with respect, though they cannot defend them, they fly to them for protection; and dread their anger. The other adore the workmanship of their minds, and form unto themselves Noble <HI>Ideas</HI> which they fall in love with, the more beautifull the idols were, the greater impression did they make upon their wils, and the more eloquent they were in describing them, the more superstitious were they in honouring of them. This errour blinded all Philosophers vertue, which is but a habit which we acquire that we may do Good, was the only Divinity which these hood winckt people worshipped; and not considering that there is nothing in the soul of man, which
<PB N="119" REF="76">
merits a Supreme Honour, they bore respect to the good inclinations thereof, when they were governed by the rules of morality; this su|perstition cost the Apostles, much more pain, than the superstition of the people, they had more ado to convert Philosophers, than Ty|rants; and experience taught them that reason was more opinionated than force. Two ages were sufficient to overthrow all idols of brasse and marble, and though their adorers used cruelty to defend them; martyrs through their patience triumphed over them. But all the Reign of Jesus Christ hath not sufficed to destroy the idols of the minde. The Doctors of the Church have in their writings set upon them, but have not been able to bear them <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Idolatria ho|die extra tem|plum, &amp; sine idolo agi potest. <HI>Tertul. de Ido|lolat.</HI></NOTE> down; and there be yet some libertines, amongst the Children of the Church, that do adore them. They are not so much attracted by the grace of the Son of God, as by the vertue of the <HI>Pagans;</HI> good Nature appears more con|siderable to them than godlinesse, and they more esteem <HI>Seneca's</HI> or <HI>Aristotles</HI> morals, than those of Saint <HI>Paul,</HI> or of Saint <HI>Austine</HI> his di|sciple; yet the Vertue which these Philosophers taught in their Schooles had her esteem heightened onely by reason of her difficul|ty, and was admired by her partakers onely through a vain beauty which did dazle them. But Christian vertue is at once both beauti|full &amp; easie, you need but love her to acquire her; to possess her cost us nothing but desires; and the Holy Ghost who sheds her in our souls, endues us with strength to overcome the difficulties which ac|company her; therefore is it that vertue in Christians did oft times fore-run reason; they were wise before the years of wisdom, and the Agnesses who had Jesus Christ onely for their Master, were vertu|ous before rationall Grace fupplyed their weaknesse, torments exci|ted their courage they were constant, not having read the death of <HI>Socrates,</HI> the life of their spouse made up all their morality, and his maximes confirmed by his examples inspired them with more of Constancie, than was requisit to triumph over the cruelty of Ty|rants, and to confound the vertue of Philosophers.</P>
<P>But truly I do not wonder that the vertue of <HI>Pagans</HI> was so weak; since they were divided, and that reason which did guide them could never reconcile them; for though they be said to have one &amp; the same father, and that they are so straitely united together that a man cannot possesse one of them, without possessing all the rest, yet ex|perience, teacheth us that they have differences which Philosophy
<PB N="120" REF="77">
hath not yet been able to terminate. Though they conspire together to make a man happy, they trouble his quiet by their division, and make so cruel war one upon another, as to have peace in his soul, he is obliged to drive out one of the parties from thence, Mercy, and Justice cannot lodge together in one Heart, their Interests are so dif|ferent as they are not to be accorded. A man must renounce mildnes if he will be severe, and severity if he will be mercifull. Morality hath not yet found out a secret to reconcile these two vertues, nor to unite them together thereby to make an accomplish't Prince. Wis|dom and simplicity hold no better intelligence, the one is always diffident that she may be secure, she oft-times hastens her misfortune, whilest she thinks to avoide it; she had rather do ill, than suffer ill; and her humour is so given to guile, as the best part of her being is made up of dissimulations; simplicity walks in a clean other track, for she findes her assurance in her goodnesse: she fears no outrage, because she beleeves no injustice, she had rather be unfortunate than blamefull, and she is of so good an inclination, as she resolves rather to receive an injury than to do one. If wisdom be not upon good termes with simplicity, she is not upon much better terms with valour: Nature must do a miracle to make them both meete in one Subject; they require different tempers, and the aversion is such, as morality cannot accord them: wise and cautious men are always fearfull, and valiant men are alwayes rash; wisdom is of a cold con|stitution, and doth not ingage her self in any perill till she see a wicket whereby to get out. Valour is hot and firie, considers not danger so much as glory; the one of these startles at all things, the other won|ders at nothing; the one and the other of them hath their advan|tage, and their defaults, but there is so great an opposition between them, as one and the same man cannot Possesse them both. Thus perfection is an <HI>Idea,</HI> which a man may easily conceive, but never ac|quire. Morality is an Art which hath more of light than of force, and which very well knows the desert of vertues, but cannot ap|pease their differences.</P>
<P>'Tis mans advantage that the vices cannot be reconciled, that these monsters, who have the same designe, cannot make the same Army, and that Nature to weaken them, hath divided them; to say truth profusion and avarice cannot lodge together in the same breast, and though the one of them proceed from the other, they wage war one
<PB N="121" REF="77">
upon another which ends onely in death. Audacity and Cowardise are incompatible, and though Fortitude be their Common enemy, they cannot joyn together to charge upon it. Indulgencie, and cruel|ty, are two faults equally pernicious to Monarchies; and 'tis hard to say whether it be the greater misfortune, to live under a Prince who punisheth all; or under <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Malum qui|dem esse, Prin|cipem habere sub quo nihil ulli liceat, pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">us vero eum sub quo <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 words">.</NOTE> one who punisheth none. Licentiousnes countenanceth sin, and when Law, are violated, &amp; no punishment in|flicted, no honest man can live securely. Cruelty sets al the world to|gether by the ears, &amp; as her injustice makes no distinction of persons, she doth astonish as well the innocent as the guilty; but Nature doth not suffer these two extreams to lodge together, &amp; this wise Mother not being able to impede their birth, thought to oblige us by hindring their society. I acknowledge we are obliged to her fore-sight, and that our misfortune had been much greater, if these two enemies of our quiet could have kept good Intelligence; but it must also be confest that she was wanting either in Power or in wil, when she <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> permit|ted that the vertues should war one upon another, and that the good Habits, which she had opposed to bad ones, cannot joyn their forces in our assistance. This is also an effect of Original sin, and I am confi|dent this division was not amongst them in the State of innocency; that justice was not an enemy to Mercy, that wisdom warred not a|gainst simplicity, and that all these Sisters lodg'd peaceably together in the heart of Man. Christian Grace which repairs the miseries of sin, with use, hath pacified the difference between the vertues; they fight altogether joyntly under the banner of charity; this vertue, which they acknowledge for their Sovereign, quieteth all their quar|rels; she takes from justice what it hath of rigour to agree it with mer|cy, she takes from mercy what it hath of remisnesse to reconcile it with justice. She unites the wisdom of the serpent with the inno|cence of the Dove: she stifles particular interests, to favour the publique good, and bindes them so close together, <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Charitas vin|culum perfecti|onis ab Apost. appellatur.</NOTE> that they forgoe their own inclinations to assume the inclinations of their Soveraign: Hence it is that Christians are wise without malice, and simple without ignorance, that they are gener|ous without boldnesse, and advised without Cowardlinesse; that they are just without rigour, and mercifull with indulgencie; they have the perfections of Philosophers, and want their Er|rours, they tast their pleasures, not their miseries, and Posses|sing

<HEAD>The third Discourse.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>That Vain Glory is the soul of the Vertue of Infidels.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>TIs a strange yet a true thing that the pride of Man was twin in birth to his misery, and that he began to be proud assoon as he was miserable. Amidst his greatnesse he was humble, whilest he commanded over all Creatures he obeyed God, and his Empier was grounded upon his submission; <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Hinc enim delectavit quod dictum est eritis sicut Dii, quod melius esse pos|sent summo ve|roqut principio cobaerendo per obedientiam, non suum sibi existendo prin|cipium per su|perbiam. Dii e|nim creati non suae virtute, sed Dei veri parti cipatione sunt Dii. Plus autem appetendo, ho|mo minus est, qui dum sibi sufficere dele|git, abillo qui ei vere sufficit defecit, <HI>Aug. li. 14. de Civit. cap.</HI> 13.</NOTE> but when his disobedience had caused his unhappinesse, ambition seized him, and forgetting that he was a slave to the Devil, he pretended to the So|vereignty of the whole world. To effect this his design, he tryed many meanes as unjust, as shamefull: for through a high piece of folly he would shake off the yoke of obedience, which he owed to God; live in a sinfull Liberty, and follow no Laws, but those of his will. Ha|ving laid the first ground work of his Rebellion, he endeavored to frame it into a Tyranny, and having shaken off his Sovereign he strove to get Subjects. He used Art to make himself be beloved, and violence to cause himself to be feared, he made his equals his slaves, under pretence of preserving or defending them; he opprest their Li|berty, and turned his false protection, into a true Tyranny; hence did proceed the first usurpations, which getting authority in process of time, became at last legitimate: for pride was the originall there|of, and the desire of government took away the equality, which na|ture had placed amongst men. Those who liked not this way took another road, being possest by vain glory, they endeavored to practice vertue; that they might win glory, and studied to <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Nullam vir|tus aliam mer|cedem laborum periculorumque <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">erat pra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">r ban<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> laudis &amp; gloria: qua qui|dem detract<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> quid est, quod in hoc tam exi|guo vitae curri|culo tantis nos in laboribus ex|erceamus. <HI>Cicer. pro Archi&acirc; Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ta.</HI></NOTE> do gallant A|ctions, onely that they might be praised. Their way of Command was not so rigorous, but it was not much lesse haughty than the o|ther; for they pretended to rise by merit, and mildly to enforce men to submit themselves to their guidance; whatsoever they did by this motive could not be innocent, and whatsoever vertue they exercised
<PB N="123" REF="78">
by this principle had onely a deceitfull appearance of vertue. Vain Glory was the soul of all their designes; did they defend their Coun|try, did they conduct their Subjects, did they fight their Enemies? 'twas rather out of the love of Glory, than of Justice. Let them be as carefull as they pleased to hide their intentions, they were always clearly discerned by their actions or their words; their thoughts might be discovered without Tortures, and whilst the name of Ju|stice was in their mouthes, nothing but vain glory was observed to be in their hearts; they did publiquely affirm, that to make a kingdom happy, <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Florent civi|tates si Philoso|phi imperant aut Imperatores philosophantur. <HI>Jul. Capitol.</HI></NOTE> a Philosopher must either be the King, or the King a Phi|losopher, they boasted that they had withdrawn men from out of Forrests, that they had inclosed them within Towns; and by giving them Laws, they had taught them Civility. They governed a while with mildnes, but when one went about to blame their government, or to reform it, they had recourse to violence; and the same vain Glory which made them assume the Scepter to command, obliged them to take up Arms to defend it. Thus did Philosophers become Tyrants, and Pride which had used cunning to establish her self, used Force to perserve her self.</P>
<P>This truth appeared in the greatest part of Monarchies, but shone the clearest in the Roman Common-wealth; and we may affirm, the more she affected vertue, the more was she Subject to vain Glory; <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Haec sunt duo illa libertas &amp; cupiditas laudis humanae quae ad facta com|pulere miranda Romanos. <HI>Aug. lib. 5. de Civit. c.</HI> 12.</NOTE> for those who shall examine her proceedings may observe, that all her most Glorious Actions had no other motive, than a desire of preserving her liberty, of acquiring Glory, or of increasing her au|thority. When <HI>Romulus</HI> his valour <HI>Numa's</HI> Piety, and <HI>Tullies</HI> wis|dom, had Founded the Roman Common wealth, she thought not so much upon extending her limits, as in defending them, she never de|clared war against her Enemies, but when she saw her self in danger of being opprest. She fought for her Altars and for her houses, and her first commanders had no other spur to egge them on to vertue, than a desire to live, or dy in liberty. When all <HI>Italy</HI> was under their Laws, when those who would not be their friends, were become their Subiects, they suffered themselves to be tickled with the de|sire of Glory; and those who had no other thought but to be free, began to covet Fame and Glory. This ambitious Passion being very powerfull, made them undertake a thousand gallant Actions; and we must confesse the Roman Common-wealth, was never more

Saint <HI>Peter,</HI> all whose words are Oracles, Places complacency amongst the number of sins, and condemning those who raise them|selves above their deserts, he condemnes those also who take plea|sure in their Vertues, and Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> discovering the intention of these great Apostles, teacheth us that there are two sorts of Tem|ptations; the one exterior, which being easily discovered, are not hard to overcome; the other interior, and which lying in the bosome of our souls, are as hard to cure as to know. Of this sort is their Tem|ptation, who not requiring the praises which they deserve, or who re|jecting such praises as are given them, cease not notwithstanding to be displeasing to God, because being filled with a vain glory, so much the more dangerous, as the more subtill, they delight in themselves, and do not raise themselves up to the <HI>Summum Bonum;</HI> which is the fruitfull Fountain-head of all true vertues.

<HEAD>The fourth Discourse.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>That the vertue of Infidels cannot be True.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>VErtue is so beautifull as her very shaddow is delightfull; vi|ces have some sort of comelinesse when they borrow her accoutrements, and we cannot forbear praising such errours, as appear in her likely-hood, We approve of prodigality in Princes, because it counterfeits liberality; We admire boldnesse in Souldiers because it hath an air of valour and courage: We adore ambition in conquerours, because it borders upon Generosity. This errour would be excusable did it not advance further; but there are some men who preferring appearances before truths; value a glorious vice at a higher rate, than a neglected vertue. <HI>Socrates</HI> his conference with his friends seems of a more lofty style to them than doth S. <HI>Pauls</HI> last words, and this Philosophers discoveries prevailes more with them, than the examples of our Martyrs. Hence it is that Christians admire the vertues of Infidels that not content to make their Apologies, they make Panegyricks in their behalf, and praise men on earth whom God punisheth in hell. Saint <HI>Austine</HI> not being able to endure this injustice, <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e cult<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> ve|ri Dei etiam quod videtur virtus esse, pec|c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tum est, nec p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ere <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> Deo sine Deo p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|test: qui vero Deo non pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">cet, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ui nisi <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> &amp; Diabalo placet. <HI>Aug. lib. 1. 1. de voca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; Gen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">. c.</HI> 7</NOTE> which had its birth with the Pelagian Heresie, oppo|seth it in a thousand parts of his writings, and contradicting the rea|sons which it proffers in 'its defence; Makes Christians confesse, that the greatest part of infidels vertues, are but glorious vices; as I am of his opinion, I will march under his colours, and I will make use of his weapons to preserve the advantages of the Graces of Jesus Christ, and to take away the vanity of corrupted Nature.</P>
<P>But to proceed by degrees we must presuppose with S. <HI>Austine,</HI> that no action can be holy which proceeds not from Faith, accord|ing to this holy Fathers sense a man must be faithful if he will please God, and the soul which is not enlightened by the Divine light, can|not acquire any Christian vertues; that which hath no regard to the <HI>Summum Bonum</HI> cannot be good in this sense; and where supreme

Astrologie, which seems to be wholly composed of Doubts and Errours, boasts her selfe of having con|stant Principles, and to extract the good fortune, or bad fortune of men from the Conjunction of Planets, and from the Aspect of those Constellations which govern at their birth; Physick, which ought not to be more certain than it's objects, hath Prognosticks, which do not often deceive it, and the Symptomes which happen to sick folks, do presage their lives, or deaths.

Futurity is a time wich suffers not it selfe to be approached; two of it's moments makes us loose our knowledge; and the wisest <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Occultat co|rum faemina Deus, &amp; ple|rumque bono|rum <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">sae sub diversd specie <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t. <HI>Plin. in P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">eg.</HI></NOTE> Politician, unlesse he be a Prophet, can|not foresee the mis-fortunes which Futurity threatens him: that which he hath prepared for his defence, serves most commonly for his un|doing; and that which he looked upon as the ground-work of his fortune, becomes the cause of his mis-fortune: oft-times the fairest appearances produce the worst effects; somtimes he is blest by a mis-fortune, and the wave which should have swallowed his Vessell up, doth oft-times happily throw him upon the Shore. Therefore hath the wisest of all Philosophers acknowledged that

The body and the soule are as differing in their constitution, as in their conduct: for the body hath eyes in the face to conduct it, it sees whatsoever is before it, and none behinde it's sight, extends it selfe to such objects as seek it, and not to such as shun it; but the soule contrariwise, seeth things that are behinde her, and seeth not things that are before her, her eyes are on her back, not in her face; she remembers what is past, and knows not what's to come; wisdome endeavours to fortifie her sight, but she is not so happy as is Astrology, which hath found out prospective Glasses to consider the Stars: for after having made use of her conjectures, <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ium fu|turi ex praete<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">i|to venit. <HI>Senec. Epist.</HI> 83.</NOTE> she is forced to confesse, that she foretels things to come, onely by consideration of what is past, and that she is deceived as oft as she undertakes to judge of what's to come. Prophets are onely permitted to consider this part of time: one must be admitted into Gods Cabinet to comprehend mysteries be|fore they happen. The Devils themselves for all their subtill under|standing cannot divine, their predictions are as doubtfull, as ob|scure; they speak in hidden termes to excuse their ignorance; and the Oracles of these proud spirits are always conceived in confused words, to the end that their Adorers may not discover their fal|shood. Man (who is not much lesse proud than the Devill) per|swades himselfe that assisted by wisdome, he may know secrets to come, and that experience which is the Mother of this vertue, may furnish him with conjectures, the <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Seris venit usus ab annis.</NOTE> evidence and certainty whereof, are equally infallible: but who knows not that experience depends on yeares? that a man must be conversant in affaires to come by it, and that the Proverb of <HI>Ars longa vita brevis,</HI> ought rather to be affirmed of the Politician, than Physician.</P>
<P>If wisdome be voide of light, she is not much better provided of power; and if she be-blinde a man without injuring her, may say she is yet more weak; for she oft-times sees mischiefes which she cannot hinder.

What need is there in hasten|ing our dislikes, in advancing those evils which come always too soon, to what end do we loose the present time for fear of the fu|ture? what good doth it us to be now miserable because we must be so hereafter? This is notwithstanding the most usual effect of wis|dom, for as she hath more light then power she foresees our disasters, and not being able to hinder them, advanceth our punishment.</P>
<P>To understand this, we must know that wisdom and power are but one and the same thing in God, that which deliberates, is that w^t^h resolves, and that which undertakes, is that which puts in execution. If from Divine perfections we passe to the Divine persons we shall finde that the Son, who is the wisdom of his Father, is likewise his power, that he who is his thought, is also his strength; he doth fore|cast designes, and finisheth them, he forms enterprizes, &amp; executes them, he is that Pallace proceeding from <HI>Iupiters</HI> brain, which past for the Goddess both of sciences and arms, &amp; which was no lesse recom|mendable for her valour, then for her wisdom: hence it is that he is called by severall names in the holy Scripture, and that he is some|time called the <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Verbum Dei &amp; brachium Dei filius passim appellatur in Scripturis.</NOTE> word sometimes the arm of his Father. But in man these qualities are divided, he who is wise is not always strong, and when he hath wisely resolved, he must borrow aide from some other vertue, to execute his resolution with courage. Wisdom is ti|merous, because cold; valour bold, because hot, and as their quali|ties require severall tempers, they do not oft times meet in one and the same person: but say Nature should work a miracle by agreeing them, and that a man should have as much courage as conduct, his power would never equall his <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Prudentia plerumque in|f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">lix, quia re|rum eventus ab illa non p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n|dent. <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">cid.</HI></NOTE> wisdom, and after having given wise Counsell, he would not be answerable for the event; there is a So|vereigne Providence which hath reserved unto it self the disposall of all things, and which takes delight in giving bad successe, to the best resolutions, to teach us that our happiness, and unhappinesse is in the hands thereof.

This made the <HI>Pagans</HI> say that fortune laughs at wisdom, and that to confound our presumption, she had so ordered affairs, as that hap|pinesse and wisdom did not always keep Company: she makes fools happy when she cannot make them wise, and not being able to make wise men fools, she makes them unfortunate, <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Disputatur an tutius sit foelicem esse quam pruden|tem.</NOTE> whence it is that Po|liticians doubt whether good fortune or wisdom be the more requi|site ingredient to the composure of a puissant Prince.

<P>Though these two qualities which accompany wisdom, are suffi|cient enough to tarnish her glory, the third is much more injurious to her, for ignorance and weaknesse bear their excuses with them, and there are glorious vertues which have not much more power, nor much more light, but guile is odious, and vertue turns to sin, when

All Conquerours were of his Humour, they left the Pillage of the enemy to their Souldiers, they parted the Pro|vinces which they won amongst their Domesticks, they made their slaves Sovereigns, and of all the advantages which they got by their victories they only reserved glory to themselves. This man feared to lose his reputation by losing his Liberty, he was ashamed to suffer himself to be taken by his Captive, and he would leave no shamefull marks of his defeats, where he had left such glori|ous proofs of his victories.

<P>Though all Vertues be delightfull, and that they have suf|ficent charmes to make them appear amiable even to their Enemies, ^g <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nonnefortitudo optabilis est, at|qui pericula co~|teminit &amp; pro|vocat.

Justice is reverenced even by her persecutours; Tyrants are affraid of her shadow, and after having bootlesly imployed violence for their defence, they have been fain to have recourse to Justice for their preservation: wisdome is adored by all Politicians, a man must have lost his wits not to value her, if she be not esteemed by fools, she is admired by wisemen; all sorts of people confesse that she is as necessary for the Govern|ment of private Houses, as of States. All parts of Morality take her for their Guide; and without the assistance of this Vertue, they can neither make an honest man, a States-man, nor a Father of a Family. Temperance is beloved by all men, her Enemies respect her, in those that love her, they confesse that pleasures can neither be innocent, nor yet delightfull, when she is absent; and that pleasure without temperance is the punishment of the unchast. But certainly all the Vertues hide their heads, when Fortitude displayes it's beauties. These Stars are eclipsed, when the other Sun ap|pears; and people cease from looking upon Justice in Princes, pru|dence in Politicians, and Temperance in Philosophers, when they consider the courage of the unfortunately Innocent.</P>
<P>Though this Illustrious Vertue be sincere, and that the pain wherewith she is assailed make her unquiet, yet hath she allure|ments which win her more admirers than the other have lo|vers: There are but few that look after her, but all admire her, and that because persecution must precede courage, every one is content to reverence a vertue, which must cost so dear to come by; she in-nobles such as possesse her, she comforts the condition of

slaves, heightens the Majesty of Soveraignes, augments the beauty of women, and of all the ornaments which adorne either the minde, or the body, there is none more Majesticall than Fortitude; if we will believe Philosophers, there is nothing on earth more worthy of Gods looking on, <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Non sunt ista quae possint Deo|rum in se vul|tum convertere, sed puerilia &amp; humanae oblecta menta levitatis. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">cce spectacu|lum dignum ad quod respiciat intentus operi suo Deus.

<P>If the earth produce nothing which may make God stay to look upon it, and if generous actions merit not that God should busie himselfe about them, yet must we confesse that they are approved of by all people; and that men do more admire a Philosopher who suffers death patiently, than a Monarch who governs his State with Justice. He through his constancy triumphs over whatsoever the world hath of most furious; since he overcomes pain, he may well vanquish pleasure; since he despiseth death, he may laugh at for|tune; and since, he fears not the threats of Kings, he may well e|nough sence himselfe against their promises: he tramples under foot all those pleasures which we seek after, and all the pains and sorrows which we apprehend: the greatnesse of the danger incourageth him to battell, <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Avid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> est p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|culi virtus, &amp; quo ten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> non quid passura sit cogitat, quoniam &amp; quod passura est gloriae pars est. <HI>Sen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">. de P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ovid. cap.</HI> 4.</NOTE> the more difficulty he foresees, the more glory he hopes for; he values not that much, which cost him but little; he tries himselfe when fortune spares him, and to keep himselfe in breath, he makes Enemies, when he meeteth with none. Past ages have pro|duced men, who have not changed countenance amidst Tortures; their Executioners could not wrest moans from out their monthes, nor make them confesse so much as by a sigh the pains which they
<PB N="151" REF="92" MS="y">
indured; there have been some, who to triumph over Tyrants, have laughed amidst their punishments: such hath been their constancy, as that Joy did not abandon them even in that condition: their cou|rage seemed to make them insensible; and that by being accustomed to torments, they were grown familiar to them. Thus did <HI>Scevola</HI> defie <HI>Tarquin</HI> the proud, his whole hand mist him, and his burning hand struck him with astonishment: hee escaped the Princes anger by preventing it, he pierc't his heart, whose body he could not hurt; and <HI>Tarquin</HI> judging of the Fortitude of all <HI>Romans,</HI> by that of <HI>Scevola,</HI> he feared to have those men for his Enemies, who fear|ed not the fire. But not to adde to this discourse by examples, it may suffice to listen unto the reason of Philosophers, and to acknowledge with them, what advantages Fortitude hath over all other vertues.</P>
<P>Man began to be unhappy, when once he became criminall, his subjects became his enemies, the Elements declared war against him, and those elements which went to his composure, divided themselves, that they might alter his temper, and shorten his life: Pain and pleasure agreed together for his undoing, life and death were reconciled to make him suffer. Morall Philosophy, found out vertues to succour him, and every one of these faithfull Allies un|dertook to defeat an Enemy: wisdome undertook to prevent far distant mischiefes, and by her addresse to avoid them: Justice looks upon her to end al the differences which self-love; and Interest should breed amongst men. Temperance charged her selfe with ruling voluptuousnesse, and with hindring such pleasing Enemies from seducing reason: and <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Et quod omn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">iment, &amp; quod omnes optan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> calcat fortitu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Senec. Epist.</HI> 48</NOTE> Fortitude, as most couragious of all the rest, undertook to fight against pain, and to overcome death. This cru|ell Enemy to Man-kind defying the power thereof, took a hundred shapes upon him, to astonish the others constancy, he called in Tor|tures, and sicknesse to his aid, he invented Gallowses, and Wheeles, he extended Racks, incensed Lions, and Bears, armed the Elements to satisfie his cruelty, and made torments, and punishments, of whatsoever nature had produced for our use. All these vertues were siezed on by astonishment: when they saw so many Monsters con|spire mans ruine, wisdome confessed, she wanted addresse to molli|fie them: Justice profest, she had not sufficient Authority to sup|presse them; and Temperance protested; she wanted vigour to restrain them: Onely Fortitude promised to withstand them:
<PB N="152" REF="93">
and though she saw her selfe, forsaken by her Sisters, she resolved to charge upon them: wisdome offered her her light, <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Cum aliquis tormenta soriter patitu omnibus virtutibus uti|tur, c&ugrave;m una in promptu sit, &amp; maxim&egrave; appa|reat sortitudo, cujus perpessio, &amp; tolerantia ra mi sunt.

With these weak Forces she enters the pitcht Field; where she had for assistance hope, and boldnesse. The former inhartned her by her promises, the second promised <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">lesse, but performed more; for she discovered unto her the weakness of her Enemies, and taught her on what part she might assail them. Fortitude, thus assisted, ingaged her selfe upon all occasions; she received as many blows as she gave, she mingled her bloud with the bloud of her enemies; she past all her life in this exercise, &amp; if she took any ease after a fight, 'twas onely to prepare her self against those that were to ensue. By all this discourse, 'tis easily seen, that the de|signes of Fortitude are much greater than those of all the other ver|tues, &amp; that it is not without reason that they yield the Honour to her, since they dare not appear upon such occasions of Combates as she doth, and bears away the victory.</P>
<P>Though Fortitude be thus beautifull in <HI>Idea,</HI> yet is she but weake amongst the <HI>Pagans,</HI> and covers true blemishes under deceitfull ap|pearances; for as in them <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Sine dono Dei nec virtutes pos|sunt appeti vel haberi, nec ea|rum similitudi|nes quae sunt vitia virtu'es imitantia devi|tari. <HI>August. lib. 3. de vita conte up l. c.</HI> 1.</NOTE> she cannot have charity, for her originall, she derives oft-times from self-love, and inherits all her Fathers weaknesses; it is her own Glory she must seek, since she is ignorant of Gods Glory; it is anger which must give her heat, revenge which must provoke her, and vain glory, which must in-animate her, since 'tis not Faith that doth assist her. All these passions mixt together, make up the greatest part of her greatnesse; and when one shall examine her intentions, or motives, he shall finde that her noblest exploits, are but magnificall sins. All those men who in ancient times have been esteemed couragious, have contemned onely pain to purchase <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Fortitudinem Gentilium mun|dana cupiditas, sortitudinem Christianorum Dei Charitas fa|cit <HI>Concil.

In effect, their most glorious Actions have their defaults, their valour is nothing but despair, and all that the <HI>Roman</HI> Eloquence calls courage, is but Pusillanimity. Certainly <HI>Cato</HI> was the wise man of <HI>Rome,</HI> he held there the same Rank which <HI>Socrates</HI> did amongst the <HI>Athenians;</HI> his death goes for the chiefest testimony of his courage; and Histo|rians never speak thereof, without highly praising it; he had fruit|lesly endeavoured to appease the Civill Wars, he sided, which the

Fortune would prolong his death to try his constancie, and this Tragedy seemed so pleasing to him, as he en|deavoured to spin it out, that he might the longer taste the pleasure thereof. <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Liquet mihi cum magno spe|ctasse gaudio deos, cum ille vir acerri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> sui vindex gla|dium sacro pe|ctori infigit, dum viscera spargit, &amp; il|lam sanctiffi|mam animam manu educit. <HI>Senec.

<P>Yet a man need not to be much enlightened, to observe the de|faults of a so well disguised death; for if <HI>Cato</HI> be to be praised for having killed himself, all those that did survive him deserve to be blamed. 'Twas weaknesse in <HI>Cicero</HI> to have recourse to <HI>Caesars</HI> cle|mencie; 'twas either Folly or Fearfulnesse in him, not to despair of the Republiques well-fare, and yet to reserve himself to raise her up

Who does not think that <HI>Cato</HI> was prouder than <HI>Caesar,</HI> and that it was not integrity, but want of Courage which put the Poneyard in his hand? Who knows not that it was rather weak|nesse, than Constancie that made him die? had he had courage enough to have under-gone adversity, he would never have had re|course to despair; he wanted patience in his misfortune, and if he could have endured <HI>Caesars</HI> victories, <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Non fuit in <HI>Catone</HI> hone|stis turpia prae cavens, sed in|firmitas adver|sa non sustinens: Nam si turpe e|rat sub victoria <HI>Caesaris</HI> vivere, cur author hu|jus turpitudinis Pater filio fuit, quem de <HI>Caesa+</HI> ris benignitate omnia sperare proecepit. <HI>Aug. lib. 1. de civit. c.</HI> 23.</NOTE> he had not Committed self-Murther; For if he thought it shame, to beg his life of his enemies, wherefore did he Counsell his Son to do it?

What ever mischief threatens us, we must never flie to despair, though the decree be pronounced, the Scaffold set up, and that all things assure us we must die, we must not play the Hang|mans part, nor hasten our death to free us from misery. This is to make our selves Ministers of our enemies cruelty, to excuse their fault by preventing it, and to commit Parricide, to exempt them from man slaughter.</P>
<P><HI>Socrates,</HI> who was not better instructed than <HI>Cato,</HI> was more generous, because more Patient; he might have freed himself from Poyson by a sword, and by fasting five or six dayes have acquitted himself from his Enemies violence: yet he spent a whole Month in Prison, he affordeth death leisure to imploy all its horrours to try his constancie, he thought he was to give way to the Laws of his Country, and not to refuse his last instructions to his friends, they intreating for them. If this <HI>Pagan</HI> Philosopher thought he ought not to attempt any thing against his own life, because he was in the hands of justice, no man can with reason make himself away: for from the first moment of his birth he is subject to the Laws of God, and unless he will do an unjust act, he must waite, till he that put him into the world take him from thence; to hasten our death, is to intrench up|on his rights, to kill our selves, is <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Hoc dicimus hoc asserimus, hoc modis om|nibus approba|mus, neminem spontaneam mor+tem sibi inferit debere, velut fugiendo mole|stias tempora|les, ne incidat in perpetuas. <HI>August. lib. 1. de civit. c<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">p. 26</HI></NOTE> to overthrow his workmanship; and to bereave him of the least of his Subjects, is to attempt against his Sovereignty.

We must wait till the same Judge, which hath pronounced the decree of our Death, make it be executed; and it belongs to one and the same Power, either to shew favour or Justice to the guilty. All those stately words which flatter our vain Glory, and do incourage our despair, do not excuse our fault, when we attempt upon our owne lives.

In fine; no reason can justifie despair: the number of our enemies, the evils of the present life, the Good of the Future, the cruelty of sicknesses, rigour of servitude, sweetnesse of liberty, strength of Temptations, nor the very fear of sin, are not considerations sufficient to make us hasten our death; 'tis alwaies poornesse of <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">De <HI>Catonis</HI> facto quid po|tisstmum di|cam, nisi quod amici ejus etiam docti quidam viri qui hoc fie|ri prudentius dissuadebant, imbecillior is quam for tioris animi esse cen|suerunt. <HI>Aug. li. 1. de civit. c.</HI> 23</NOTE> spirit, not to be able to suffer the evil which we will shun by Homicide, Pride hath lesse part in this crime then weaknesse, and whatsoever praise the despe|rate man expects for his attempt, wise men will alwaies beleeve, that if he had courage enough to bear the miseries of life, he would never have had recourse to so cowardly a remedy.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>That Friendship without Grace is alwaies inter|essed.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IF the vertue of <HI>Pagans</HI> have her stains, we must not wonder if their Friendship have her defaults: sin hath corrupted the best things, and her malice hath left almost nothing in man, <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Omnibus ami|caes est qui sibi, sed solum sibi qui Deo est.</NOTE> which doth not deserve reproach or punishment: since a sinner is upon bad termes with God, he cannot be upon good terms with himself, nor with his Neighbour. If he love himself, tis in excesse, and if he love another, tis for interest; his will being in the power of his e|nemie, he can hardly make good use of it; whatsoever he does, he is in danger of sinning; his love is not much more Innocent than is his hatred, and be it that he loves his friends, or hates his enemies, tis with so little justice, as he stands alwaies in need of pardon, profane Philosophie prefers Friendship before vertue; she gives her such prai|ses, as taste of <HI>Flattery;</HI> and if we will beleeve her reasons, she will perswade us, that the joynt uniting of Hearts, is the greatest content|ment which man can partake of on Earth. 'Tis the knot of <HI>Socie|ty,</HI> without which States cannot be preserved, nor Families main|tained.</P>
<P>Nature made this project in production of woman, whom she drew from the rib of man, to the end, that the resemblance and e|quality which she placed between them might oblige them to <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Quis est ami|cior quam fra|ter fratri? aut quem alienum fidum invenies fituis host is fu|er is? <HI>Salust. in Juguitha.</HI></NOTE> love one another; she renews this in brothers, who proceed from the same Originall, and who are shaped in the same womb, to the end, that all things may invite them to love. Vertue endeavours to make this good more universal, and seeing that nature did not give all men brethren, she would give them Friends; &amp; repair their losse with usu|ry. For though brothers proceed from the same stem, they are not alwayes of the same Humour; they differ often more in their Inclinations, then in their Countenances: but say there were any thing of resemblance in their humours, the dividing of Estates divides hearts; and Interest, (which hath to do every where) doth many times ruine their best intelligence. But <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Amicitia pa|res facit aut in|venit.</NOTE> Friendship (more powerfull than Nature) makes a pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ty
<PB N="157" REF="95">
between those whom she will unite; the unity of hearts, is that which makes all things common, and the words Thine, and Mine, which sets division between Brethren, cannot do the like between Friends. Nature leaves us no choise, in her alliances, we are enga|ged before we be capable of choise; and she oft-times makes us love a Monster, because he is our Brother; but friendship gives us a free|dome of choise, she permits us to take the best, and we are onely to blame our own folly, if in the liberty she leaves us, we make choise of one for a friend, who deserves not our affection. Our Brethren are the workmanship of nature, she did not advise with us, when she gave them life; and not having the care of producing them, we delight not in preserving them. <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Amicitia vinculum null&acirc; ex parte sang|uinis viribus in|ferius.

And as Mothers expose themselves for their Chil|dren, because they are their workmanship, so men expose them|selves for their friends, because they are their Productions.</P>
<P>But not to spend more time in observing the advantages which friendship hath over and above nature; we must confesse, there is nothing in the world which ought not to give place to friendship: Law, which preserves Estates, which punisheth vice, defends ver|tue, is not equall to her, neither for antiquity, nor power. Punish|ments nor rewards were never ordained' till <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Si regnaret inter homines amicitia, lex aut nulla esset, autsuper flua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Plato</HI></NOTE> friendship began to coole; whil'st she continued in full vigour, the use of lawes was use|lesse, and the Politiques do confesse, that States are better governed by good Intelligence amongst Subjects, than by Ordinances of Princes: the latter reforme onely the mouth, or the hand; impede onely bad actions, or insolent speeches: but the former reformes the heart, and gliding into the will, guides desires, and regulates thoughts. The Law ends differences, but friendship reconciles enemies; the law inhibits injuries, but friendship adviseth good offices. In fine, the law is requifite to the commencement or initiation of a good man, but friendship is required to his accomplishment; and by her advice renders him perfect.</P>
<P>She is also of use to all sorts of Conditions, and that man liues not, that needs not a friend. A friend is needfull to old men, to assist them, to young men, to guide them; to the mi|serable, to comfort them, to the ignorant, to instruct them; and to

Kings themselves, to increase their felicity. For though their condi|tion seem to be raised above that of all other men, and that amidst the abundance of riches, and honours, wherewith they are enviro|ned, there remains nothing for them to wish for, yet ought they to make friends, and endeavour a delight, which agrees as well with Greatnesse, as with Innocence. Friendship is the best of all exteri|our Goods, and 'twere unjust that Kings who possesse whatsoever else is of good, should not possesse this; Friendship obligeth us ra|ther to give, than to receive; <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Etiam beat us devet am' cos habere I, quia bonorum exter|norum maxi|mum amicitia, deinde ami<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">i po|tius dare quam accipere, quod beatudini non repugnat: ab|surdum, quoque beatum sacere solitarium, ho|mo enim est ci|vtle animal. <HI>Arist.

In fine, happy Princes ought not to be solitary, and I know not whether any one of them would accept of their felicity, at the rate of living solitarily: Therefore greatnesse doth not forbid friendship to Soveraignes, that which seems to keep them aloofe off from this vertue, draws them nearer to it; and their power is never more pleasing, than when imployed in succouring the miserable, or in making men happy. Neither do we see any Prince who hath not his Favourite. <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Sine amic is omnis cogitatio, esset taedium, omnis operatio labor, omnis ter|ra peregriuatio, omnis vita tor|mentum, fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e quo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">um solatio vivere esset mo|ri. <HI>Caffiodor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> in Epist.</HI></NOTE> The proudest Mo|narches of the world, grow weary of commanding, they finde more content in a friend, than in a slave; and how brutish soever their nature be, they are well content to have one, to whom they may un-bosome themselves. <HI>Tiberius</HI> loved <HI>Sejanus;</HI> and had not this Favourite become his Rivall, it may be he never had decreed his death. <HI>Nero</HI> could not fence himselfe from friendship; the sweet|nesse of this vertue, vanquisht that Monsters cruelty; and whil'st he quencht the flames of <HI>Rome,</HI> by the bloud of Christians, he had some Confidents, whom he called friends. This Infidell Prince, whose subjects were all slaves, and in whose Empire the desire of liberty was a fault, wanted not Favourites whom he loved; he plays with those he ought to destroy, he makes those the objects of his love, who ought to be the objects of his fury; a certain Captive, had power over the Tyrant, and under the assurance of friendship gave lawes to him, who gave lawes to the greatest part of the world.</P>
<P>Though these reasons do mightily inhance the merit of Friend|ship, yet must we conclude in Saint <HI>Austines</HI> Principles. That the Friendship of <HI>Pagans</HI> is defective, and doth not deserve the praises that are given it. For if we take <HI>Aristotle</HI> for our Arbi|tratour, friendship ought to be established upon selfe-love, and

to love his <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Est ille sui a|mantissimus qui partem id am quae in homine dominari debet amat. Itaque virum bonum sui amantissi|mum esse opor|tet. <HI>Arist.

He who prefers the pleasures of the body, before those of the mind, who hazards his honour to preserve his riches, and who injures his conscience, to encrease his reputation, cannot be a good friend to others, because he is his own Enemy; and who wants vertue, cannot have friendship. Morall Philosophy with all her precepts, cannot reforme a disorder, which since the losse of o|riginall righteousnesse, makes up one part of our selves: the un|righteousnesse thereof hath past into our nature, and as we can|not without grace be upon good termes with our selfe, neither can we without her be upon good termes with others. We ei|ther give them too much, or not enough; we cannot keep that just measure, which makes friendship reasonable, we turne a ver|tue into a passion; or to speak trulier, we make an innocent a|ction criminall; and the same selfe-love which puts us on ill termes with our selves, puts us upon the like with our Neigh|bours; we love his errours, whil'st we think to love his perfe|ctions; we excuse his sins, in stead of condemning them, and we oft-times become guilty of his faults, for having approved them. <HI>Blosius</HI> confesseth he would have burnt <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg"><HI>Blosius</HI> nec silentio honesto nec prudenti sermone, salu|tem suam, ne qua ex parte i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">foelicis amici|tia memoriam desereret, tueri voluit. <HI>Valer.

It may be 'twas for this cause, that <HI>Aristotle</HI> blaming friendship, whil'st he thought to praise her, said, that her perfection consisted in her excesse; and that far dif|fering from common vertues, which do consist in mediocrity; she was never more admirable, than when most excessive: That a man might give too much, but not love too much; that one might have too much courage, but not too much love; that a man might be too wise, but not too loving; yet this excesse is vitious, and ex|perience teacheth us, that Common-wealths have no more dange|rous Enemies, than those who are ready to do or suffer any thing for their friends. Therefore 'tis that the same <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Amicus <HI>Pla|to,</HI> amicus <HI>So|crates,</HI> sed me|gis amica veri|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>Aristot.</HI></NOTE> Philosopher prescribing bounds to friendship, did publickly professe, that truth was dearer to him than <HI>Plato:</HI> &amp; that when he could not accord these two, he fore|went his friend to maintain his Mistresse.

What glorious name soever one attributes to friendship, she hath no other designes than these, when she is led on by self-love; and whatsoever language the Infi|dels have held, these have been their onely motives, when they have lost either life, or liberty, for their friends; if they were silent a|midst tortures, and if the cruelty thereof could not compell them to discover their associates, 'twas either for that they valued friend|ship more than life, or that they thought treachery worse than death: if they would not out-live their friends, 'twas to free themselves from sorrow and solitarinesse; and if for their delivery, they exposed
<PB N="161" REF="97">
themselves to Tyrants, 'twas for that their words bound them to it, and that they thought they should be no losers in an occasion, where|in, though with losse of life, they won honour. <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Qui pro ami|co perit, vitam amico praebet, sibi gloriam pa|rit. <HI>Aristoteles.</HI></NOTE> And to say truth, <HI>Aristotle</HI> hath well observed, that he who dyes for his friend loves himself better then his friend; and that in an Action which seems to violate Nature, he doth nothing which self-love may not advise him to, since that by suffering death, he labours after glory, and that by erecting a sacrifice unto his love, he buildes a Trophy to his Memory.</P>
<P>The example of <HI>Damon</HI> and <HI>Pythias</HI> may confirm this Truth; They had been brought up in <HI>Pythagoras</HI> his school, the conformity of their humours, and opinions had so straightly united their souls, that death it self could not part them. The Tyrant <HI>Dionysius,</HI> to whom vertue was an Enemy, condems one of these faithfull friends to his last sufferings; he findes that his occasions ingage him to make a voyage, the Tyrant, who would adde mirth to cruelty, per|mits him so to do; provided he finde out Baile who may take his place, and who will be bound to die for him, if he defer his re|turn: <HI>Pythias</HI> accepts of this Condition, and entring into Prison, wisheth that the day of Execution drew nigh, that he might deliver his friend; the fatall hour being come, and <HI>Damon</HI> not yet appear|ing, <HI>Pythias</HI> is led to punishment, he rejoyceth at his happinesse, whilst the people are afflicted at his misfortune: he excites the Hang|man to make hast, and fears death lesse then his friends return; and without excusing his delay, or suspition of his fidelity, he commends Fortune, which keeps his friend from making good his word: at this very moment <HI>Damon</HI> arrives quite out of breath, he presseth through the crowde, presents himself before the Tyrant and the Executioner, and calls for his baile in: <HI>Pithias</HI> pleades the hower is past, that <HI>Da|mon</HI> having failed in his assignment is no more lyable to death: and that it is he <HI>(Pythias)</HI> that <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Admiratus amborum ani|mum Tyran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">us supplicium fidei rem sit, insuper|que eos rogavit, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">se in societa|tem amicitiae re|ciperent. <HI>Valer.

This strife makes the Hang-man stay his hand, moves wonder in the people, and softens the Tyrant, who for their fidelity revokes his Decree, desires to be admitted into their society: &amp; this monster, who had never stu|died any thing, but to make himself to be feared, ravisht to see this Miracle, wisheth to be beloved.</P>
<P>It cannot be denied but that this was a rare example, and that in this mutuall correspondancy the height of friendship is seen; for it
<PB N="162" REF="98">
was of power to inspire the contempt of death, <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Hae sane vires amicitiae mortis contemptum in|generare, vitae dulcedinem ex|tinguere, crude|litatem mansue facere, odium in amorem conver tere, poenam be|neficio p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">sare potuerunt. <HI>Idem ibid.</HI></NOTE> to cancell the love of life, to mollifie cruelty, to change rage into mildness, and to turn the pain of punishment, to a glorious recompence; but who doth not also see, that this contestation might rather proceed from vain Glory, then love? who thinks not that each of these loved themselves better than their companion? since leaving life to him, he would keep Glory to himself? who will not confesse, that in this dispute there was more of Ambition then fidelity? and who will not acknowledge, that so gallant an adventure might have been wisht for by men not so wel known to one another? and between whom there was not so great a friendship, as between <HI>Damon</HI> and <HI>Pythias?</HI></P>
<P>But we must not wonder if friendship be faulty amongst the <HI>Pa|gans,</HI> since she is not alwayes innocent amongst Christians, and since interest, which gives against the designes of Charity, keeps her from inlarging her self, and doth unjustly confine her self between two parties; for we suffer our selves to be perswaded by Philosophy, that common friendship cannot be reall, that he who loves many, loves none, and that who doth so readily ingage himself, doth disingage himself with as much as Ease. Yet the Son of God bindes us to love all Christians as our brothers, he will have his body and blood, to be the bond of all the faithfull, and that his chiefest <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Vnus est Pater vester vos au|tem omnes fra|tres estis. <HI>Matth. c.</HI> 23.</NOTE> mysteries tend onely to the uniting of them together: his pleasure was, that we should all have one and the same Father, to the end, we might have one and the same inheritance; he ordeined but one Baptisme, to the end, that our birth might be alike; and that the difference of Con|ditions being banisht from out his Church; reciprocall love might not by mistake be diminished; he gave us but one head, to the end, we might be inanimated by the same spirit, and that the conformity of our opinions might be the preservation of our friendship: he hath <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Omnes uno pane participa|mus. <HI>Apostolus Paul.</HI></NOTE> left us his body in the <HI>Eucharist,</HI> to the end we might have one and the same food; and that being converted to himself we should be obliged to love one another, as being his members; he hath caused us to be born in one and the same Church; to the end that we might have but one Mother upon earth, as we have but one Father in Hea|ven; he hath promised us one and the same Paradise, to the end, we might have one and the same Country; and that being so straight|ly united in time, we may not be separated in Eternity; yet all these powerfull means cannot keep friendship amongst Christians; self

love derides them, the division of wealth divides their wills; every one prefers his interest before Charity; the Common people end their differences by suite at Law, Gentle-men by Duels, and Princes by Battails; <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Cum sit inter vos zelus &amp; contentio nonne carnales estis, &amp; secundum hominem am|bulatis. 1. <HI>Co|rinth.</HI> 3.</NOTE> Men defend their right either by cunning, or by force; not considering that Jesus Christ lives in our enemies, we kill them to revenge our selves, and commit murther, to cancell an injury.</P>
<P>But though we should be more charitable, we cannot shun being unfortunate; for sin hath so corrupted our nature, &amp; Divine Justice hath so severely punisht sins, as the life of man is rather a succession of miseries, then of years: man cannot live long without much suf|fering, if his body be in health, his minde is sick, if his wealth be not exposed to injustice, his Innocency is exposed to Calumny: if he fence himself from one misfortune, he is assayed by another: and he learns to his own cost, that long life is but a long punishment.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>That the Uncertainty and Obscurity of Knowledge is de|rived from sin.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT must be confest that man is very unfortunate in becoming guil|ty, since his perfections, and his defects are almost equally fatall to him. <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Natura bonis suis male vti|tur, &amp; unde se defendi existi|mat accusatur. <HI>Prosp. contra Collator. ca.</HI> 22</NOTE> His vertues are false, and his vices true; his most glori|ous actions do oft-times derive from so bad an originall, as they are not to be praised without injuring in some sort both grace and rea|son. His ignorance doth not always excuse his sin, and his know|ledge doth not always enhance his vertue. The more he is know|ing, the more guilty is he, as Saint <HI>Paul</HI> saith, <HI>He withholds the truth in unrighteousnesse;</HI> and his light is intermixt with so much darknesse, that it may lead him out of the way, and cannot conduct him. This is notwithstanding mans most violent passion: desire of knowledge is born with him, and if it makes not his difference, it is one of his chiefest Proprieties. For Beasts are wrought on by ambition, they fight for glory; and as if that were the onely reward of their victory, they pardon their enemies, after they have beaten them: they are tormented with love and jealousie; Lions can endure no rivalls, and if they want rewards to honour fidelity, they want not chastisements to punish Adultery. Desire of life is not much lesse violent in beasts, than in men; the same instinct which animates Tigres to seek out prey for their nourishment, makes Stags hide themselves in woods for their preservation. Nature teacheth them remedies for their evils, and this common mother furnisheth them with herbes to cure them: the apprehension of death encourageth the most timerous; when they are bereft of all hope of safety, they turn their fear to fury; and to shun danger, throw themselves head-long into it. But the desire of knowledge is peculiar to man, and there is no cruelty, which he useth not to content his curiosity. He rips open the bowels of the earth, to know the secrets thereof; he melts metals, to discover their essences; he descends to the bot|tome of the Sea, to learn the wonders thereof; he turns the world

Epist.</HI> 88.</NOTE> the first without the second occasioneth Opinion, the second without the first, produceth Faith. Therfore 'tis that all Sci|ences boast to possesse these two advantages, and employ all their power to perswade us, that they are evident, and assured; but the means they make use of to prove this, contradicts their design, and makes their doubts and obscurities equally appear. For they draw their light either from Time, Authority, or Experience: Time is the father of truth, but is also oft-times the murtherer thereof, ac|cording to the <HI>Rabbines;</HI> 'tis the witnesse of all things, but it suffers corruption; and the depositions thereof are as obscure, as doubt|full: all knowing men complain, that life is short, the way to know|ledge long; and that it were requisite to spend whole Ages in the School of Time, to become learned. 'Tis only permitted to <HI>Damons,</HI> who are ancient as the world, to profit under a Master, that discovers his secrets only to such, as through their own industry observe them.</P>
<P>Authority is grounded upon the worth of those who have gone before us: their antiquity gives them credit, we think them abler than our selves, onely because they are older; and we dare nor op|pose their opinions, because they are no longer able to defend them; they onely rule, because they live no longer; and if they beare a|way the victory, 'tis because they are without the danger of the fight.

That which we call the worlds Antiquity, <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Antiquitas mundi suven|tus saeculi. <HI>Bac.</HI></NOTE> was but it's Infancy; men, not being able to advantage themselves by the labour of their Ancestours, did live in profound ignorance, and left the glory of finding out truth, to the care of those that should succeed them.</P>
<P>Experience is grounded upon the Senses, and hath all her good from their reports: but all men know these Messengers are unfaith|full, that they are corrupted by objects, that the soule which is by them advised, is oft-times deceived; and that nature hath given her an inward light, to free her selfe from their Superchery: they mistake themselves daily in their own operations; &amp; if we will believe these blinde guides, we shall be always engaged in errour. The Sun appears greater at his rising, than at Noon-day; the Heavens seem to meet with the earth at the Levell of the Horizon; and men think a long walk narrower in the extremities thereof, than in the middle. <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Si protagorae credo, nihil in rerum natura est nisi dubium nisi Nausiphani, hoc unum cer|tum est nihil es|se co ti, si Par|menidi nihil est prater unum: si Zenoni ne unum quidem.

The modestest among them have boasted to know nothing, but that they knew nothing; and to have learnt by their study, that mans greatest knowledge was but a Depth of ignorance.</P>
<P>The uncertainty thereof is accompanied with uselessenesse, and let her promise what she pleaseth, she teacheth us things which are rather curious, than profitable. Science is not vain onely, because she is proud, but because she is given to lying: for she makes those that court her hope for miracles; and to hear her servants, or her slaves speak, you would think that were a remedy for all evils, and a means to come by all vertues: but if we will examine all the mi|series of men, we shall not finde any one that may be lessened by knowledge. Sin hath reduced them to a condition wherein both

All these stand in need of help in their differing conditions, and are in danger of shipwrack, unlesse they be assisted by a favourable and gracious hand. Knowledge boasted that she would succour them, and men abused by her pro|mises, sided with her under this confidence; but after they had list|ned to her instructions, they found she abounded more in light, then in heat, and more in vanity, then in power. To say truth, she busieth her selfe in enlightning the understanding, not being able to heat the will; and in stead of instructing things usefull, she is content to vent curiosities. Not being able to accord the Elements within our bodies, nor yet the passions in our soules, she busieth her selfe in sorting voices, and in forming an agreeable harmony out of differing Tones; not being able to withstand vices, nor irregular inclinations, she undertakes to fight against wilde-beasts, or ene|mies; to get the victory where the danger exceeds the honour; and to bear away Triumph, where injustice and fortune have a greater share then courage or wisdome. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Doces me quo|modo voces con|fonent, fac po|tius quomodo animus meus secum consonat.

<P>When she saw she could not observe the wonders of nature, she appli'd her selfe to consider the Debauchments; and passing by her goodliest operations, either in silence, or oblivion, she entertained men with her disorders onely, or with her diversions. For all Sci|ences which are now in request, and wherein great men do glory, teach nothing but ridiculous things, and fill their disciples mindes with naught but smoak, &amp; winde. Were it not better that Astrology should teach us the way to heaven, than uselesly to teach us the Number of the Stars, the Influence of Planets, and Motions of the Sphears? Were it not to be wisht, that Arithmetick, which teacheth to calculate immense summes should teach us to bound our own desires, and not to set by riches? were it not to be desired, that the Mathematicks, in stead of instructing us how to besiege Towns, and not to defend them, should shew us how to preserve our own liberty, and how to keep us from the Tyranny of sin?</P>
<P>If in fine, Sciences were rationall, would they not rather
<PB N="170" REF="102" MS="y">
endeavour to make men Vertuous, than Knowing? and if they were not slaves to Curiosity, would they not labour more to regulate the will, than to satisfie the understanding? and yet the chiefest of Philosophers, after having in all his writings <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Scire aut ni|hil, aut parum confert ad vir|tutem. <HI>Aristot.</HI> Doctrin&acirc; qui|dem politiora, sed non meliora fiunt ingenia. <HI>Tertull.</HI></NOTE> made the Panegyrick of knowledge, after having offer'd Incense to this Idol, and after having purchased her as many Adorers, as he had Disciples, confesseth, that she is of no use to vertue; and that though she may make men more Learned, yet shee cannot make them Bet|ter. In effect the most knowing men have not alwayes been the most vertuous; and those who have Written best, are not those that have lived best. <HI>Seneca's</HI> life agrees not with his writings; the counsels which he gives to <HI>Nero</HI> in <HI>Tacitus</HI> are not like those which he gives him in his books of anger, and clemencie; he is much more generous in his epistles to <HI>Lucilius,</HI> then in his consolation to <HI>Polybius:</HI> and his naturall questions taste much more of Philoso|phie, then that bloody invective which he wrote after the death of <HI>Claudius:</HI> these two pieces discover his nature, which in the o|ther he sought to disguise: when he sets forth vertue to the life, and gives her so many charmes to make her Lovely, me thinks I seek a Black-more painting a fair Woman, or a corrupt Lawyer pleading an Honest cause. <HI>Socrates</HI> and <HI>Plato,</HI> though they were the most learned of their age, were not the most vertuous; their acti|ons require rather Apologies than Panegyricks: if they condemn ra|ther ambition, 'tis to authorize uncleannesse; if they contemn'd the love of Women, 'twas thought 'twas to authorize the like of yong men; and that if quencht impure flames, 'twas to kindle Hellish ones. <HI>Epicurus</HI> and <HI>Zeno</HI> breathed forth nothing but either Plea|sure, or vaine glory; if the one wage war with vice, 'tis onely to purchase Glory, and if the other suppresse his Passions, 'tis onely that he may enjoy the more Rest, and that he may adore Pleasure in the temple of vertue. Thus is knowledge unprofita|ble; and to reap any advantage by her instructions, <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Addite scien|tiae charitatem, &amp; erit utilis scientia. <HI>Augu.</HI></NOTE> a man must ask counsell of Charity. For to what end is it that we know what is good, if our bad inclinations keep us from doing it? and what advantage shall we receive from a science, which can neither with|stand vice, nor defend vertue?

but fear keeps us from doing so; we know, that we ought to incom|modiate our selves, to serve our friends; but pleasures divert us from it: we know, that we should prefer Honour before pleasure, and innocence before both; but ambition and delight will not per|mit us so to do: so as it is to no purpose to advise us, unlesse the Obstacles which oppose themselves to that advise be removed, and unlesse the will be heated at the same time that the understanding is enlightened.</P>
<P>But that which is yet more grievous, and which obligeth all men to confesse, that Knowledge is corrupted by sin, is, that she is an enemy to vertue, and that under pretence of defending her, she wageth war against her. The <HI>Roman</HI> Common-wealth did never flourish more then in the <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Melius suisset non didicisse scientiam, post|quam docti pro dierunt, boni esse desierunt.</NOTE> first Ages, wherein she was content to know, that she was to honour her Gods, guide her People, assist her Allyes, and to fight her enemies: she lost her integrity when she would increase her knowledge: Pleasures en|tred <HI>Rome,</HI> together with forreign sciences, and from the time that once the <HI>Romans</HI> began to dispute concerning vertue, they cea|sed to practise her: the <HI>Greeks</HI> revenged themselves on them by their Philosophers; not being able to overcome them by Arms, they found a meanes how to corrupt them by their conferences; and giving them Learning, they bereft them of Justice, where|by they had won so much over all the people of the world. <HI>Athens</HI> was more learned than <HI>Lacedaemon,</HI> but <HI>Lacedaemon</HI> was more vertu|ous than <HI>Athens;</HI> Vertue triumphed over Eloquence, and this Town which was wholly composed of Philosophers and Orators, was brought to serve the other which abounded in ignorance. Ex|perience teacheth, that knowledge doth abate courage; that in po|lishing the understanding, she weakens it; and that in teaching how to speak well, she makes us forget how to do well. The <HI>Turks</HI> owe their valour totally to their ignorance; and if any Innocencie remain amongst the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> 'tis because they have not yet been ac|quainted with the mischeif of knowledge.</P>
<P>Wisdom her self is not reconciled to her: these two Sisters, which Philosophers boast to have united, cannot agree together in any ex|traordinary degree. It seems impossible for a man to be both Learned and wise; <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Multae literae te ad insaniam adduxerunt; loquitur ex sen|tenti&agrave; commu|ni. <HI>Act.

The most dangerous folly is not Stupid; that which is occasioned by Ignorance, is easily remedied; but that which is oc|casioned through Study, makes both Physician and Patient despaire; in fine, knowledge is the learned mans punishment; she is more boundlesse then ambition, <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Qui addit sci|entiam, addit &amp; laborem. <HI>Eccle|siast 1. cap.</HI> Dedit hanc pes|simam occupa|tionem homini|bus. <HI>Ecclesiast. 1. cap.</HI></NOTE> all her desires are out of Order, the more she possesseth, the more she wisheth for; the Richer she is, the Poorer she esteems her self; and framing daily new designes, she makes those that love her confesse, that she is a vexatious occupation, which God hath given them onely for their Chastisement: that he who addes New-lights to what hath formerly been known, addes more Paines to former Troubles; and that who labours after more knowledge, labours to make himself more Miserable.</P>
<P>It were to be wisht, that as God hath tane immortality from us, to shorten our Misery; he had likewise deprived us of profane know|ledge, to lessen our sufferings: and then we should have found, that ignorance and death, are rather Favours, then punishments. A man must become ignorant, to become Faithfull.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS Eloquence is the Mistresse of handsome language, as she makes the Panegyricks of Princes, vaunts her self to put a valuation upon vertue, and to reward her for all the glorious troubles she undergoes, so hath she not been wanting in giving unto her self those praises which she thinks are due unto her, and to imploy all her cunning in making her worth appear. For if we will beleeve her, she boasts that no power equals hers, and that without use of fire or sword, she hath the power of perswading the opinioned, of reducing Rebels, and of obliging wicked men to side with vertue. <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">An ego falso scripsi cedant armatogae, &amp;c. qui togat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> ar|matos, &amp; pace bellum oppressi.

In fine; if she expresse her self by the mouthes of her Orators, we are bound to beleeve, that whatsoever is atributed to Philoso|phie or to Justice, is onely the work of Eloquence. <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Eloquentiae multae urbes su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t constitutae, plurima bella exsti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">cta fortis|simae societutes sanctissimae ami<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">itiae com|paratae. <HI>Cicer. lib. 1. de art.

<P>'Tis hard to say, whether Cunning be the father of Eloquence, or Eloquence be the mother of cunning, but 'tis easily to discerne, that each of them assist other, in the bearing down of truth. Both of them being ingenious in extremity; they dissemble their mean|ings, and hide their hatred under the appearance of love: they speak on their enemies behalfe, and the one of them seems to em|ploy his wiles, the other her Figures and Tropes, onely to make truth appear the more pleasing: yet under pretence of serving her, they injure her; and under colour of establishing her power, they destroy her Empire. For this vertue, worth adoration, despiseth deckings; she knows her beauty is never more ravishing, <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Veritas sermo est simplex. Am|mian. <HI>Marcel. lib.</HI> 14.</NOTE> than when most neglected; she rejects borrowed lustre; and paint be|ing a kin to falshood, she approves not of the use thereof. She su|spects any thing that may deceive, her language is plain, her appa|rell modest, and were it not for fear of those unchaste ones, who prophane even holy things with their looks, she would throw a|way the vaile that covers her, and shew her selfe stark naked to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> her lovers.</P>
<P>As all her glory consists in her naked plainnesse, so doth also her strength; the very sight of her is sufficient to make her be beloved; she very well knows, that they that know her cannot oppose her, nor yet defend themselves from her. <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Magna est vis veritatis quae contra omnium ingenia callidi|tatem, soler|tiam, contra fi|ctas hominum insidias facile se per seipsam de|fendit. <HI>Sen.

Her very sight is sufficient to make her be obey'd, her pre|sence stifles rebellion, and as soon as she appears, she awakens re|spect and love, in her Subjects hearts. But if the malice of the Age were such, as should make her seek for partners to defend her;

<P>But least I may be accused of falling into an errour, which I finde fault with, I will examine the figures, and make such as make use of them, confesse, that they are onely to be termed pleasing falshoods. The Metaphora, which is so frequent with them, and wherewithall they heighten their style, to raise up the meannesse of their cogitations, is it not an Imposture? and doth not Eloquence abuse her Auditors, when she will perswade them, that the fields are thirsty, that the drops of deware pearles, flowers in medowes are stars, and the murmuring of waters musick? if thus much li|cense be to be allowed, who cannot say, that little birds are An|gels of the Forrests? that Whales are living rocks, or ships with soules? that the Sea is a moving earth, and fountain water, liquid Christall? <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Non possunt aedificari haec mendacia, sine de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">litione v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|ritatis. <HI>Tertull. lib. 2. in Mar|cion. cap.</HI> 1.</NOTE> who can imagine that truth needs such cunning to de|fend her selfe, that men are onely wrought upon by such raving, and that a man cannot please, unlesse he be ridiculous?

<P>Are not Allegories impertinent? when to un-weary mens minds, they abuse them, and say one thing when they think another? they will perswade us, that a Ship is a Common-wealth, Tempests, the State-affairs wherewith it is troubled, and Mariners, the lead men that govern it.

<P>If truth complain of Rhetorick, reason hath as much cause so to do; and who shall consider, what ill offices she hath received from her, will finde, that she should never implore her aid: for though this Sovereign be not always at peace, within her Territories, and that her Subjects do somtimes despise her authority, Eloquence is not sincere enough to re-invest her in her power, and it oft-times falls out, that whil'st she thinks to stifle disorder, she augments it. For Reason hath nothing to fear in her Empire, but the errour of her understanding, the obstinacy of the will, the revolt of passions, and the unfaithfulnesse of the senses; let her prevent these disor|ders, and she may be sure to raign peaceably. For what concernes the understanding, it needs no Rhetorick to perswade it, itcareth not for <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Veritas si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e or|namentis ad persuandendum potenti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">r.</NOTE> ornaments, truth is as pleasing to it in the mouth of a Philo|sopher, as of an Oratour; the lesse truth is expatiated, the more force doth the understanding finde in her; and the lesse she hath of Art, the more doth it reverence her power. As for the will, it is so free, as nothing can force it; grace alone hath power to ravish <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">&punc; and only God can sway it without using violence. The passions must be calm'd by dexterity; he is a wise Pilot, who can saile long upon their Sea without suffering shipwrack. And as for the senses; they must be won by fair means, and they must be loosened from ob|jects to be submitted to reason.</P>
<P>Eloquence boasts, that in this point, she hath great advantage o|ver Philosophers: the Cadence of her periods smooths the senses; she imitates musick, and makes use of the voice of Oratours, to in|chant the ears; <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Eloquentia est idoncoru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> ver|borum &amp; sen|tentiarum ad pronuntiati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> accomodati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; continens vocis vultus, gestus moderationem cum venusta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e. <HI>Cicer. in Rheto.</HI></NOTE> the gesture of their bodies, their studied actions, and all those graces which accompany Pronunciation, steal away the heart by the eyes, and work wonders upon the will: Figures raise passions, draw tears, encourageth Auditours to choler, and put weapons into their hands to revenge themselves of their Ene|mies.
<PB N="178" REF="106">
But I finde that all the means which Eloquence attempts, are extreamly dangerous, and that the remedies which she applies, are worse than the malady which she would cure. For thinking to flat|ter the senses, she engageth them in voluptuousnesse; whil'st she would divert them from, she accustometh them to delight; and though her designe be innocent, yet ceaseth it not to produce ill effects. For as oft as a pleasing Oratour defends an ill cause, and that he imployes all his good parts in favour of injustice; the sen|ses, which seek onely after content, suffer themselves to be borne a|way by his cunning; and making interressed reports to the under|standing, they engage it in their revolt. Thus is a pleasing fal|shood better entertained than truth; and vertue is lesse valued than vice, if she appeare more austere.</P>
<P>Eloquence is not more fortunate in taming passions, then in charming senses: for though she be acquainted with the secret of kindling and allaying choller, of setting love and hatred on fire, of abusing hope, and sweetning despair, yet hath she this of mis|fortune, that as she laies one passion asleep, she awakens another; and be it for want of dexterity, <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Invenit no his malus orator remedia saepe periculis peiara. <HI>Senec. Tragic.</HI></NOTE> or for her diffidence of her own strength, she never sets upon vengeance, unlesse she be assisted by ambition; she meddles not with love, without exciting hatred, and quels not hope, without raising fear. Thus she hurts us, to cure us; and her remedies are worse than our diseases. She imitates those bad Physicians, who debauch the stomack, to refresh the bowels; and who undo one part, to preserve another; for not weighing the danger, she oft-times awakens cruelty in a Tyrant, to encourage him against an Enemy; she excites ambition in a Con|querour, to incline him to clemency; and hazards a whole King|dome to save a guilty person. Men blamea Prince, who to revenge himselfe of his Subjects, puts weapons into the Rebels hands, and and who under colour of stifling a commencing sedition, streng|thens a party, which justles out his Authority; yet this is the order observed by Eloquence in her Orations; and expearience teacheth us, that to overcome a passon which opposeth her designes, she will not fear to awaken another which will entrench upon the publique Liberty. <HI>Cicero</HI> flatters <HI>Cesars</HI> vain glory, to obtain <HI>Marcellus</HI> his pardon, he propounds glory to him, to divert him from rigour: yet <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Cum aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ctus repercussit affe|ctum: a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t me|tus aut cupidi|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s aliquid im|pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">vit non ra|tionis tun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> be|n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">io quicvit, se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> affectum infid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> &amp; mal&aacute; pace. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">enec. li. 1.</HI> de li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> cap. 8.</NOTE> sees not that to extinguish the fire of his choller, he kindles the

<P>Her other designes are not more just, and she deals not more mild|ly with liberty than with reason; for though she always vaunt to take her side, and to defend her against such enemies as war against her, I finde she is the first that chargeth on her, and that there is no difference between an Orator and a Tyrant. They take severall ways, but their Armies are alike, <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">yrrani &amp; ora|tor is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> est discrimen, nisi quod ille corpo|ribus, hic animis imperat.</NOTE> and their manner of government is e|qually violent; Tyrants make use of fire and sword, to astonish their Subjects, and Oratours imploy anger and revenge, to seduce their Auditors. Tyrants forge chaines to keep them in, that resist them; and Oratours frame discourses which violate the will of those that listen to them. Tyrants make themselves be feared, because they cannot make themselves be beloved; and Orators make them|selves be beloved, though they know very well how to make them|selves be feared: Tyrants affright us, when they cannot win us by fair means, and Orators deceive us, when their perswasions falle them. In fine, Tyrants butcher our bodies, and Orators tyrannize over our mindes. I think not the Republique of <HI>Syracusa,</HI> much more unhappy under the Tyranny of <HI>Dionysius,</HI> then was the Common-wealth of <HI>Athens,</HI> whilest she languished under the elo|quence of <HI>Do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">sthenes.</HI> There are some Philosophers of my opi|nion, and <HI>Cicero</HI> himselfe doth not differ much from it, since he confesseth, that an old man hearing the great <HI>Pericles</HI> make an Orati|tion; after that he had formerly heard the Tyrant <HI>Pisistrates,</HI> cri'd out aloud, that he had never seen two men more like, and that he did no lesse dread the ones eloquence, than the others cruelty: in ef|fect, he was not in the wrong; for the event shewed, <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Quid enim in|ter Pilistratum &amp; Periclem in|terfuit, nisi quod ille armatus, hic sine a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">mis, tyrannidem ges|sit. <HI>Cicer. 3. de orat.</HI></NOTE> that there was no difference between <HI>Pisistrates,</HI> and <HI>Pericles,</HI> save that the one exercised Tyranny with his weapons, and the other with his Rhetorick.</P>
<P>Eloquence being so dangerous, and her Empire so violent, we must not wonder, if Jesus Christ, whose designe was to win the world by fair means, would not have his Apostles make use there|of; he chose ignorant men to confute Philosophers, and to make his power be admired, his will was, that their simplicity should tri|umph
<PB N="180" REF="107">
over rhetorick. They were inspired with the gift of tongues in a moment, and the same spirit which did wonders by their hands, made known his oracles by their mouthes: but Heaven which made them so learned, would never make them eloquent; they spake be|fore the Kings of the earth, without any loftinesse of style; they discoursed without adornments before the Judges of <HI>Areopagus,</HI> they preached without figures before the Senate of <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Non con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ertit Deus Piscato|rem per orato|rem sed orato|rem per piscato|rem. <HI>August.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Rome,</HI> and yet they submitted the pride of <HI>Rome,</HI> and the eloquence of <HI>Athens</HI> to the simplicity of the Gospell. I must spend the rest of this discourse in the recitall of this wonder, and to confute Rhetoricks vain glory, I must exalt the humility of Religion.</P>
<P>Never did any designe equall that of Jesus Christ, when he sent his Apostles into the world; he meditated the conquest of the world, the overthrowing of superstition, the ruine of Idols, and the devils defeat; to effect this enterprize, Philosophers must be convinced Oratours perswaded, Monarchies vanquished. To bring this so high a designe to an happy end, one would think, that he must raise <HI>Aristotle, Demosthenes,</HI> and <HI>Alexander</HI> from their graves; he notwithstanding vouchsafes to look upon a dozen fisher|men, and to incourage them to combate, and to overcome so many enemies, he forbids them to bear Armes, to meditate for reasons, or to study speeches: and to the end, that the whole glory of so great a work might be attributed to his power, <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Eloquia Apo|stolorum tanta &amp; tam nova per|suadentium quae dicebant mira s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">erunt, non ver ba. <HI>Aug. lib. de Civit. cap.</HI> 5.</NOTE> he will have the humility of his Disciples beat down the pride of Tyrants, he will have their ignorance confound the learning of Philosophers, and their simplicity to triumph over the eloquence of Orators. If their dis|course were plain, their writings were not more aptly couched. Hardly did they write correctedly, their most usuall Figures are Barbarismes, they neglect ornament, plainnesse appeares in all their Epistles; and we have much ado to believe, that those who spake such indifferent language, should miraculously have received the gifts of tongues; yet doth the beauty of their doctrine ravish us, we are astonished with the depth of those mysteries, which they ex|plain, and their words bear so great a sense with them, as we are not troubled to fore-goe <HI>Aristotles</HI> Politicks; to read Saint <HI>Paules</HI> Epistles.</P>
<P>Since the Apostles are the Masters of the Church, and that their examples are our instructions; I advise Preachers to imitate their
<PB N="181" REF="107">
plainnesse, to affect their lowlines, to despise eloquence, and to im|plore aide from that Spirit which wins hearts without the pomp of words, and ravish the will without the ornament of language. Rhe|torick is a prophane art, and preaching is a sacred exercise; vanity hath need of cunning to sustaine her, but the Gospel is main|teined by truth: those who preach it with most setting off, are not those whose preaching works <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Nobis curiosi|tate opus non est post Christum, nec inquisitione, adjiciamus, nec Rhetorica, post Evangelium.

If I give not the same counsell to the faithfull, as I do to Preachers; tis not that I do not approve of those who would imitate the Apostles simplicity, and that I condemn those who would imitate the Orators vain-glory, but nature being faulty, we must not wonder if her language be corrupted; and since the Son of God tolerates the impurity of our sins, we must not think it strange, if he bear with the vanity of our words, till being gotten into the liberty of his Children, he frees us from the tyranny of sin and from the slavery of eloquence.</P>

If Justice punish a fault rigorous|ly, her zeal passeth for severity; if she countenance evil by suffering it, she is ac|cused of indulgency: if valour throw her self upon a danger, which she cannot shun, men esteem her rash; if she shun occasions, when her duty calls upon her, she is blamed of fearfulnesse; and by a strange destiny, she that was a profest enemy to fear, grows to love her, and becomes
<PB N="183" REF="108">
her slave. Truth is not more fortunate then vertue; for she is en|vironed with errours, which surprise her if she go out of the way; and if she listen to them, bereave her of her purity: she is seduced by falsehood, if wisedom and faith assist her not; the desire of combat engageth in danger, and her covering to overcome, makes her oft|times lose the victory. Fear is often more fatall to her than is her own courage; for whilest she avoides one enemy, she falls upon an|other; and thinking to shun an ill step or two, she falls into a preci|pice. This misfortune may be observed upon a thousand occasions, but particularly in what concerns the body of man: for some seeing the unrulinesse thereof, could not beleeve that it was the workman|ship of God; and falling insensibly into an Errour, perswaded them|selves, that the Devil was the author thereof: some others, thinking to withstand this heresie, fall into another, and considering, the beauties of the body, thought that it still retained its first purity, that the faults thereof were perfections, and that all the motions thereof might be represt by free-will, without grace. The Catho|lick truth walks in the midst between these two errours; condemn|ing the Manichees, she acknowledgeth that mans body is made by God enlivened by his breath, and fastened to the soul by invisible chaines, to make one and the same whole: condemning the <HI>Pelagi|ans,</HI> she confesseth that mans body hath lost its innocencie; that sin reigns in the members thereof, that it infecteth the soul which ina|nimates it, and that the well fare thereof, which begins in Baptisme, will not be accomplisht till the last generall resurrection. Thus God is the Author thereof, and 'tis a marke of 'its <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Deus carnis author, Christus carnis Redem|ptor est. <HI>Tertull</HI> de <HI>resur. c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rn.</HI></NOTE> Goodnesse; Jesus Christ is the redeemer thereof, and 'tis a mark of it's corruption. I therefore am obliged to part this subject into two discourses, the first of which shall contain the bodyes plea, the other its condem|nation.</P>
<P>Though the body be the least part of man, and that it be Com|mon to him with beasts, yet hath it advantages which make it suffi|ciently known, that it is destin'd to be the organ of an immortall soul. For the members thereof are so artificially formed, as we can|not judge whether they be more usefull or more pleasing; their number causeth no confusion, their difference augments their beau|ty, and their proportion gives the last touch to the work which they all together make up. All of them have their particular employ|ments,
<PB N="184" REF="109">
they mutually assist one another, without intrenching one upon another; they hold such intelligence as their good and bad is common: the tongue serves for interpreter to the whole body, the eyes serve it for a guide, the hands for its servants, the ears for in|formers, and the leggs for supporters. Some of them are in perpe|tuall motion, and never rest, Action is their life, and rest their death: whilest the eyes are lull'd asleep, the ears closed up, and whilest the feet and hands lie fallow, the heart is always in action; it seems that nature intended to make it her chief piece of workmanship, and that she employ'd all her industry to render it admirable.</P>
<P>'Tis the first part of man that lives, and the last that dies; it is so <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Cor paruum est &amp; magna cupit: vix ad unius milui refectionem sufficere posset &amp; totus mun|dus ei non suffi|cit. <HI>Hugo. li. 3. de anin. &acirc;.</HI></NOTE> little; as 'twill not suffice to give a Kite a meal; and yet so great, as the whole world cannot satisfie it: nothing but his immensity that made it, can fill the infinite capacity thereof. All passions derive from it, as from their spring-head; 'tis this that causeth love and ha|tred? 'tis this that shuns what it hates for fear, and draws neer to what it loves through desire. 'Tis lodged like a King in the midst of its sub|jects; it gives its orders, without departing from its Throne; its motions are the rules of our health, and assoon as it is assailed, we are sick: its least hurts are mortall: Nature, which knows the worth and the weaknesse thereof, hath endued all its subjects with a se|cret inclination to expose themselves for its defence, the hands put by the blows that are made at it; and knowing that their welfare consists in the preservation thereof, they hazard themselves to save it from danger. To reward this their service, this Sovereigne is so vigilant, as he never takes rest; he labours alwayes for the weal-publick, and whilest the senses are asleep, he is busied in moving the Arteries, in forming the Spirits, and in distributing them about all the parts of the Body. The Braines finish this work, and giving it its last perfection, dispose it to the noblest operations of the soul. This work ceaseth not, though men sleep; though the Soul take some re|freshment, these two parts of the Body are always in action; and when they cease to move, they cease to live. All these live in so full a peace, as the difference of their temper is not able to disturbe it: Cold accords there with heat, moystnesse is there no longer an enemy to drynesse; and the elements which cannot tolerate one an|other in the World, conspire together in man, for his bodies pre|servation. If any disorder happen, it is occasioned by forreign heat,
<PB N="185" REF="109">
the naturall Subjects never trouble the States tranquility: they are so straightly joyn'd by their Interests, as nothing can befall the one which the other doth not resent; the pain of one part is the sicknesse of the whole body: <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Sipatiatur o|culus omnia do|lebunt, omnia <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">essabunt. Quid ventrem ocule mordes: quid pedes re|mora. is: quid manus vincis? quia innexa na|tura, sunt om|nia, modequein|effabili compa|tiuntur. <HI>Chrysost.</HI></NOTE> and if the foot be hurt, the tongue complains, the heart sighes, the eyes weep, the head bowes to con|sider the evill, and the armes extend themselves to apply remedy.</P>
<P>If their love be so rare, their obedience is no lesse remarkable; for they force their own inclinations to observe the orders of the will; and their fidelity is so ready, as the command is no sooner impos'd, then obey'd: at their Soveraigns bare motion, the hands strive to be acting, the tongue explains his intentions, the eyes ex|presse his thoughts, and the eares execute his designs. The will findes out so much submission in the faculties of the soule, as in the parts of the body; she is oft-times divided by her desires, and opposed by her own inclinations; sheis a rebell to her selfe, &amp; cannot comprehend how one and the same object can cause horrour and love in her at the same time: but she never commands her body without being obey'd, and unlesse passions make a mutiny in it, or that it be dis|order'd by sicknesse, it fulfils her orders with as much readinesse, as faithfulnesse.</P>
<P>She likewise undertakes nothing without the assistance of this faithfull companion, <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Nunquam a|nima sine carne est quamdiu in carne est, nibil non cum illa a|git sine qua non est. <HI>Tertul. de resur. carn.</HI></NOTE> she stands in need of his aid in her noblest operations; and though she be a meer spirit, she can neither dis|course, nor reason, but by the interposition of the body: if she will forme thoughts, she must consult with the imagination; and if she will explain them, she is forced to make use either of tongue, or hand: <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Volutet ali|quid anima vul|tus operatur in|dicium: facies intentionum omnium specu|lum est. <HI>Tertul. de resur. carn.</HI></NOTE> she hath no strong agitations which appear not in the eyes, and when she is disquieted by any violent passion, 'tis soon seen in the face. A man must be very vigilant to hinder the commerce be|tween the body and the soule; the rules of discretion, and all art of policy, which re-commends dissimulation to Soveraigns, can|not keep their countenances from discovering their designes, nor their eyes from betraying their wills: the soule conceales nothing from this her faithfull confident; he that could well study the chan|ges which appear in the face, might infallibly know the alterations of the minde; and without needing to wish as that ridiculous <HI>Pa|gan</HI> did, one might read in the forehead, the hearts most secret thoughts. If <HI>Physiognomie</HI> be a Science, she hath no certainty but
<PB N="186" REF="110">
what she draws from the connexion which nature hath placed be|tween the soule and the body; all her observations are grounded upon the noblest part of the body; if all be true that is said of her, as soon as she sees the face, she knows the humour; and without or Charmes or Magick, she knows their intentions, whose Linea|ments she observes. Though I dare not acknowledge all this, and that I have much a do to believe that a Physiognomist can discover the designes of a wise Minister of State, by looking him in the face, and that without racking a malefactour, he may read his fault in his eyes; it sufficeth me to know that this Science is grounded up|on the commerce between the soule and the body, and that she draws her conjectures from the straight union that is between them.</P>
<P>As the Soule doth not forme any designe, wherein the body is not a complice; so doth she taste no contentment, wherein the bo|dy doth not share a part: if <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Quem enim natura usum, quem mundi fructum, quem elementorum sa porem non per carnem anima depascitur? per quam omni in|strumento sen|suum fult<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> est. <HI>Tert. de resur. carn.</HI></NOTE> she enjoy the beauties of nature, 'tis by the Senses; if she see the Azure of the Skie, the light of the stars; if she discover the extent of Fields, the fertility of vallies; if she hear the fall of Rivers, the musick of Birds, if she judge of the Glosse or Sent of Lillies, or Roses; 'tis by the benefit either of the sight, hearing, or smelling. It seems the world was made for the bodies diversion, and that all those pleasing parts which go to the composure thereof, have onely been made to delight the senses; the Sun is of no use to the glorified Spirits, and all the brightnesse of that goodly Constellation cannot light the Angels; those noble Intelligences have a spirituall world wherewith they are possest, and ravisht: they finde their happinesse in God, and all that we wonder at in the world, affords them no delight. <HI>Materia</HI> is requi|site to tasting the pleasures of sensible nature; such contentments presuppose a low condition, and it is common with Beasts to partake of such diversions. 'Tis notwithstanding one of the bodies least advantages, that the world should be made for it's use; and that this chiefe piece of Gods workmanship is destined either for it's service, or it's delight.</P>
<P>Jesus Christ followed his Fathers steps; and when he came up|on earth, he would have the body to be the object of his mercy, and of his power; though he laboured for the conversion of sinners, his greatest miracles were wrought for the healing of the sick; and the body being mans weakest part, he thought he was to treat it

with most mildnesse, and to furnish it with as many remedies, as sin hath procured it maladies.

<P>Neither did he neglect it in the institution of the Sacraments; for though they were chiefly ordained for the soules sanctification, and that these admirable Channels poure grace into the soule, yet are they applied upon the body before they produce their effects in the will; and they respect joyntly the two parts which go to mans composure. <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Caro abluitur ut anima ema|cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">etur, carovn|gitur ut anima consecretur, raro signatur, ut anima mu|niatur, caro corpore &amp; san|guine Christi vescitur ut ani|ma de Deosagi|netur. <HI>Tertu. de resur. car. ca.</HI> 6.</NOTE> The body is washt in water, to the end that the soule may be purified; the body is marked with the Figure of the Crosse, to the end that the soule may be fortified; the body receives the unction, to the end that the soule may be consecrated; the body receives the imposition of hands, to the end that the soule may re|ceive Grace; and the body eates the flesh and bloud of Christ Je|sus, to the end that the soule may be thereby nourished: Thus doth not religion destroy nature, and in her highest mysteries the pro|vides for the soules safety, by means of the body. <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Nulla omuino anima salutem potest adipisci nisidum in car|ne est adeo caro s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">lutis cardo est <HI>Tertull. ibid.</HI></NOTE> This maxime is so true, as that all Divinity confesseth, that the soule can no long|er merit, when she is once parted from the body; whil'st they are together in company, their grace may be augmented; and what|soever vertues they have acquired, they may yet acquire more, but when once death hath divided them, and that the body losing 't's lustre, is reduced either to ashes, or to wormes; the soule can no longer increase her merit, and in that condition she is onely capa|ble of punishment, or of reward.</P>
<P>Having so many obligations to her body, she cannot forget them, nay even in the state of Glory, where all her designes ought to be satisfied, she wisheth to be re-united to her body, as that wherein her intire felicity consisteth. For though she reign with Angels, that she behold the divine Essence, and that she enjoy a happinesse, to which even wishes cannot adde, yet hath hath she a passion for her body, and all the good she doth possesse cannot take from her the desire, nor memory thereof; though she hath
<PB N="188" REF="111">
made triall of it's revolts; though this friendly enemy hath oft|times persecuted her, and that she hath desired death to be freed from the Tyranny thereof, yet doth she languish after it, and contrary to their humour who have recovered liberty, yet she longs for that which did engage her in servitude. Though the body be reduced to dust, though it cause pity in it's Enemies, and though it cause hor|rour in those to whom it was so lovely, she forbeares not to desire it, and to expect the resurrection with Impatience, that her body may partake of the blisse which she enjoyes.</P>
<P>And 'tis not without much justice that she beares so much love to her body, since she owes the greatest part of her advantages un|to it, and that she hath hardly any vertue, or light, which she hath not acquired by the assistance of the senses. The soule is ignorant when first infused into the body; the knowledge which the Plato|nists attribute unto her, is but a meer capacity of apprehending. If she will be intrusted, she must be advised either by her eyes, or by her eares, she must consult with these Masters, if she will free her selfe from ignorance. How noble soever she be by birth, <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Artes per car|nem, studia in|genii per car|nem, atque adeo totum vi|vere animae car|nis est, ut non vivere animae nil aliud sit, qu&agrave;m &agrave; carne divertere. <HI>Ter|tull. de resurr. carn. cap.</HI> 6.</NOTE> she hath but weak conjectures of truth, if these faithfull officers should faile her; and should she be ingaged in a body which should have no use of senses, she would be plunged in eternall darknesse. Sight and hearing are the Organs destined to knowledge, and he who is borne deafe and blinde, is destined to live and die ignorant.</P>
<P>As the soule receives these advantages by the body, so doth she distribute them by the bodies assistance, and doth not expresse her thoughts but by the mouth of her Interpreter: she gives with the tongue, what she hath received by the eare; and as she is rich onely by means of the senses, so is she by them onely liberall. She ob|serves the different qualities of objects by the eyes, she judgeth of the diversity of sounds by the eares; she comprehends mens in|tentions by their discourse, <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Sermo de or|gano carnis est. <HI>Tertul. de re|sur. carnis ibid.</HI></NOTE> she makes hers known by the tongue, and this miraculous part of the body frames words which draw her thoughts unto the life: If those who are absent cannot under|stand her, she hath recourse to the hand, which draws her dictates upon paper: and which makes that appear to the eyes, which the tongue could not make the eares comprehend. Thus the soule acts onely by the body, and all Sciences by which we are either instru|cted or perswaded, are as well the work of the senses, as of the soule.</P>

<P>THe evils which we receive from the body are so great, as that al Philosophy is nothing but an invective <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Corpus hoc animi pondus, acpoena est p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ae mente illo urge|tur, in vincu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s est nisi accessit Philosophia. <HI>Senec.

If we will listen to the Academicks, tis a grave wherein the Soul is buried, and where being more dead than alive, she cannot make use of all those perfections which she hath received from Nature. <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Non aliter a|spicio corpus quam ut vin|culum aliquod libertati meae circundatum. <HI>Idem ibid.</HI></NOTE> If we trust the Stoicks, tis a disobedient slave, which opposeth it self to all the souls desires, and which being born to obey, hath no so great passion as to command, tis a subject which aspires to Tyranny, and which forceth its legitimate sove|reign to forgo both honour, and vertue, and to embrace voluptuous|nesse. If we will give ear to the Peripateticks, who come neerest the truth, tis the least part of Man, which being given him to serve the soul, crosseth all her designs, and hinders the execution of her no|blest enterprises. Hence it is, that all Philosophers do what in them lieth, to have no commerce with the body, and wish for death or old age, to the end that the one may weaken this Domestick enemy, and that the other may free them from it.</P>
<P>Christian Religion, which marcheth in the midst of errours with assurance, confesseth, that the body is as well the workmanship of God as the soul is, and though it be not altogether so noble, it cea|seth not to be destined to the same happinesse. But as slaves are pu|nisht for their masters, and as children sometimes bear the punish|ment of their fathers sins, the body hath been punisht for the soul, and from the time it became confederate in her crime, it partook in her punishment. Though the soul be the more guilty, the body is the more unfortunate; and of the two parts which go to the compo|sure of man, the most innocent seems to be the most miserable. For to boote that it is subject to pain by reason of the elements bad in|telligence, <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Nos gestamus la queum no|strumnobiscum, circumferimus inimic um car|nem nostram lo|quor de peccato natam, de pecca|to nutritam, cor|rupiam nimis de ipsa origine, sed multo am|plius de prava consuetudine vitia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">am. <HI>Gre. in.

<PB N="191" REF="112">
is prejudiced, that it cannot be cured but by troublesome reme|dies, that the fear of death be a punishment which lasts as long as its life, it is notwithstanding occasion of the most sins whereof the soul is guilty; and this Sovereign thinketh she should be innocent, if she were not fastened to so guilty a Party.</P>
<P>To disintangle all these things, we must know, that when the soul lost her priviledges, the body lost likewise its advantages; <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Nihil inerat quod carnem anim &ugrave; mue ho|minis foeliciter in paradiso vi|vent is offen|deret. <HI>August. 14. de civi. Dei. c.</HI> 10.</NOTE> for the same grace w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> made the soul pleasing to God, made the body sub|ject to the soul, &amp; the same innocencie which preserved the sovereign from sin, warranted the slave from death: But when once man be|came guilty, he became unfortunate; and when once he lost origi|nall righteousnesse, he therewith lost all the dependencies thereup|on; Errour and blindness slid into the understanding, malice gli|ded into the will; and by a consequence, which Divine Justice made necessary, illusion crept into the senses, sicknesse altered mans tem|per, pain disquieted his rest, and death sho tened his life. These punishments are so irksome as each of them deserves a discourse; and not to enter upon a subject which I should handle more at large, it shall suffice me for the present to make it manifest, that though the body be the Souls slave, since sin it is become her Tyrant, and that it neither tastes of contentment, nor suffers sorrow wherein it shares not with her.</P>
<P>Pain is a sensible evill, and were not the Soul ingaged in the bo|dy, she without the least commotion would behold the most grie|vous punishments; but nature having composed man of these two different parts, the bodies pain, is the Souls punishment, their good and their bad are common between them, the more noble suffers with the more ignoble, and by a strange misfortune, the soul which needs no nourishment, fears famine; she who is spirituall, fears pain, <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Non <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nim cum animus ad corp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> declinat, corpus efficitur, sed tamen defe|ctive, appetitu quodammodo corpora scit. <HI>August. l. se|cund. cap.</HI> 10.</NOTE> and she who is immortall apprehends death; she is afflicted with whatsoever hurts the body, and as if her love had changed her Es|sence, she seems to be become Corporeall. By a sequell as shamefull as necessary, she takes her part of all the bodies pleasures; she shapes desires, unnecessitated, she follows the inclmations of its senses, and forgoing truth and vertue, wherein all her innocent delights ought to consist, she rellisheth the flowers with the smelling, she tastes meat with the Pallate, she hears Musick with the ears, and seeth the diversity of colours with the eyes. Being thus become sensuall, she
<PB N="192" REF="113">
is not to be loosened from the body, she forgets her naturall advan|tages, by neglecting them, she forgoes commerce with spirits to treat with beasts; the fear she hath of death, makes her doubt her immortallity; the love she hath to pleasure, makes her despise ver|tue, and to engage her selfe too far in her slaves interest, she learns new crimes, whereof she was before innocent.</P>
<P>For although the soule be not impeaceable, and that her will be not so constant in what is good, but that she may be unfortunately parted from it, yet is she not capable of all sorts of crimes; she may be seduced by falshood, blown up by vaine glory, abased by sad|nesse, and gnawn by envy, but she should be exempt from such sins, as she is perswaded unto by the senses, if she were dis-ingaged from the body. Meer spirits are not scorcht with unchaste flames; divels are not unchaste, <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Ideo immundi spiritus Daemo|nes appellantur quia se authores vita sceleste immundeque testantur. <HI>Au|gust. lib. 2. de Civit. cap. 26.</HI></NOTE> save onely for that they counsell us to im|purity: They are pleased with this vice, onely because Jesus Christ is thereby injured, and our soules would finde no trouble in being chaste, did they not love unchaste bodies: drunkennesse, the va|pours whereof cloud reason, is not so much a sin of the soule, as of the body; did not the soule swim in the bloud, the body would never be drown'd in wine; <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Ebrietas sub|versio sensus, tempestas lin|guae, procella corporis, nau|fragium castita|tis. <HI>August.</HI></NOTE> and the greatest drunkard of the world would forgoe his love to this sin, if death had un-robd him of his body; a man must partake much more of a beast, than of an Angel, if he fall into this disorder; and men who make more use of their soules, then of their bodies, are not much subject to this infamous Irregularity. Gluttony (which may be termed the sister or the mother of drunkennesse) lodgeth neither in the will, nor in the understan|ding, it makes it's abode in the body; the pallate which tastes viands, the stomack which disgests them, are it's faithfull officers; if it make any use of the understanding, <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Cor habet in ventre gulosus, lasciuus in libi|dine, cupidus in lucro. <HI>Hieron. in Matth.</HI></NOTE> 'tis for the service of the belly; and if it reason at any time, 'tis but to finde out new sauces, which may awaken appetite. Covetousnesse, though it contest with ambition, and be insatiable, is rather a sin of the senses, than of the soule; for this illustrious Captive, makes not so many wishes for her selfe, as for the body which she inanimates: Glory and vertue are the onely objects of her desires; when she labours to get riches, or to seek out pleasure, she fits her selfe to the humour of her slave, and acts more through complacency, than inclination, or necessity; 'tis the body which needs the light of the constellati|ons

The Rebell Angels never fought to divide the riches of the earth, the division of Provinces, or Kingdoms, did never move ambition in them, the beauty of women never caused in them loose desires, nor did ever any of those sins which arise from flesh &amp; bloud, tempt those haughty spirits. The greatest part of our excesse derives from the body; if we were parted from it, we should either become innocent; or if in that condition we should have either ambition, or avarice, their motive and object would be altered. The greatest Conquerours have no motions which are not common to them with Lions; Lovers jea|lousie is not more noble then is that of Buls; and the husbandry of the Avaritious is not more just then is that of Owles, and Ants: if men be more to blame then beasts, 'tis because their soule com|plies with their bodies, and that she makes use of her advantages, to supply her slaves necessities. But the mischiefe takes it's originall from the body; and as the woman tempted man after she had been seduced by the devill, the flesh tempts the spirit after having been sollicited by objects which flatter the senses.</P>
<P>I very well know that in the State of Innocency, the soule was first guilty, and that the body being subject to reason could not ex|cite the first seditions; it was obedient to it's Sovereign, and as long as the soule was subject to God, the body was subject to the soule; but when once the soule rebell'd against her God, her body scorn'd to be commanded by her. And as mans fault had been a revolt, his punishment was a rebellion also. All our mischief ariseth from the bad intelligence which is held between the two parts, whereof we are composed; he who could appease their differences,
<PB N="194" REF="114">
might remedy our sins; and if the body did no longer rebell against the soule, we should have reason to hope, that the soule would no longer rebell against God.</P>

Love glides into the heart by the eyes; he who could be blinde, might easily be chaste; if calumny be formed in the heart, it is dealt abroad by the tongue; and what in the thought was but the malady of one particular man, becomes by discourse the contagion of a whole Town. <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Desiderii sui veneno mense|bria, corpus con|tumeli is applicat &amp; junctis com|plexibus ambo in mortiferas suavitatis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">si obdormiunt. <HI>Cy|prian. in prolo. de ope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">i. cardi|nalib.

The damned pre|serves it amidst the flames; though they know their pains shall be increased by the resurrection of their body; they cannot chuse but desire it. In hell hope triumphs over fear and pain; and this cruell enemy hath so many charmes, as though he be reduced to dust, yet doth he cause love in the soule which did inanimate him. The re|membrance of the injuries which the soule hath received from the body, and the fear of pain which she expects from thence, is not able to stifle this desire. She hopes for the day of Judgement, where she must be condemned; though she know her punishment will be increased by her re-union with her body; she cannot but desire it with impatience, and places the delay thereof in the number of her sufferings. So as we are bound to conclude, that if the body be the cause of sin during life, it will be the punishment thereof after death; and that if it hath made the soule guilty upon earth, 'twill make her unhappy in hell.</P>

The Lineaments of his face bindes us to admire the power of the hand which hath formed them, and the disposall of the parts thereof, draw no lesse praises from our mouthes, than the like of the universe. But the disorder which we see in mans Temperature, the opposition of those Elements which go to his composure, and that generall revolt which hath shed it self through|out all his members, obligeth us to detest sin, which is the cause
<PB N="196" REF="115">
thereof. We must argue in the same sort concerning our senses, and confesse, that as their use deserves estimation, their irregularity de|serves blame.</P>
<P>They are admirable in their structure, and were they not com|mon to us with beasts, we might be permitted to glory in them. The operation of the noblest of them is so subtill, as that the soule, as divine as she is, can hardly comprehend it; she admireth these Master-pieces of nature, though she have so great a share in their miracles, yet knows she not how they are done; and thinks strange that she should contribute to wonders which she cannot conceive. For the soule inanimates the senses, and this spirituall forme, is a created Divinity which sees by the eyes, heares by the eares, and expresseth it selfe by the mouth. But if the senses have their per|fections, they have also their defects; and if the soule receive any service by them, she is by them likewise much injured. They are the gates of falshood and errour, vanity slides into our soules, by their means; they are exposed to illusions; the objects wherewith they are pleased corrupt them; and being once corrupted by delight, they make no true reports unto the soule. Nature hath endowed us with them, that we might know God by things visible, and to raise us up to consider the beauty of the Creatour by the like of his works; these deceitfull Guides do notwithstanding abuse us, and sollicited either by delight, or interest, make Idols unto themselves of all the creatures, and lead us to adore sensible and perishable Gods. <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Misi nuntios meos sensus om|nes exteriores ut quarerent te, &amp; non inveni, quia mat&egrave; quaere|bam. <HI>August. soliloq cap. 31.</HI></NOTE> Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> confesseth, that he never went astray in his beliefe, save when he would follow them; and that he never enga|ged himselfe in errour, save when he gave beliefe to their advise; he sought out God with his eyes, he would have touched him with his hands, and thought to have found him in the world, whom he carried about with him in his heart.

In Civill Go|vernment, women are subject unto their husbands, and slaves obey their Masters; in Politique, the people hold of their Sovereign, and the Kings will, is the Subjects laws; but in man this order is reverst by an irregularity, which can be nothing but the punishment of sin: his soule depends upon his body; and in her noblest operations, she is obliged to be advised by the senses. Her condition is so unhappy, as she seems almost enforced to believe the ignorant, to follow the blinde, and to obey Rebels. A man would blame a State, where fools should command over wise men, where children should pre|scribe laws to the Ancient, and where women should have domini|on over their husbands; yet corrupted nature is engaged in this dis|order; and since our first Fathers sin, the senses are the souls Coun|sellours, and this faint-hearted Sovereign, renouncing her lawfull authority, receives orders from her slaves.</P>

Desire is the soules course, and she seems to command this nimble heeled passi|on, to put her in possession of what she loves. Hope comes in to the succour of desire, and promiseth her such good successe, as she resolves to make her way through all difficulties, which oppose her designes. If hope meet with more opposition then she imagined, she calls in courage to her aid, which by her valour purchaseth her the enjoyment of what she had long wished for. Such passions as are opposite to these, serves the soule to keep aloofe from what she apprehends. Fear is her flight; she doth her utmost to keep her enemy off; though she be timerous, she mingleth her selfe with hope to effect her designes; and imployes boldnesse to overcome such dangers as threaten her; if her strength be too weak, she falls insensibly into despair; and giving way to griefe, doth of necessity become unhappy. Somtimes she assumes courage in her disasters; sollicited by hatred, animated by desire, and incouraged by despair, she gets the better of the enemy which possesseth her; and findes by experience, that somtimes to be happy, a man must have been miserable.</P>
<P>These passions have so much affinity with vertue, <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Irasci peccan|tiut corrigatur, contristari pro afflicto ut libe|retur, timere periclitantine pereat, nescio utrum quisquam san&acirc; considera|tione repreben|dat. <HI>August. li 9. de Civit. cap.</HI> 9.</NOTE> as let but never so little care be taken in husbanding them, they may become vertuous. Fear is serviceable to wisdome; wise men are always ti|merous; good successe always their apprehension, and prosperity which makes others insolent, makes Polititians modest; The <HI>Tra|gedian</HI> makes <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> from the ruine of <HI>Troy</HI> apprehend the like of <HI>Sparta;</HI> his victory causeth his diffidency, and the Poet, who will make this Prince a perfect Polititian, seems to have graf|ted his wisdome onely upon fear.

thereby. Anger doth somwhat resemble justice, the one and the other of them will punish faults; and if the former be not better regulated in the revenge which she takes for injuries, 'tis because she is blinde, and that self-love whereby she is guided, makes her commit excesse. <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Contristati est is secundum Deum, quo enim secundum Deum tristitia est poe|nitentiam ad sa|lutem stabilem operatur. 2. ad <HI>Corinth. cap.</HI> 7.

In fine, all the mo|tions of the sensitive soule seem so addicted to good, as some of them cannot forgoe it's party; pitty is always praise-worthy, and the compassion of anothers evill, which she imprints in the heart, is so just, that the very <HI>Barbarians</HI> cannot condemne it; the indig|nation which we conceive for the misery of the good, and for the prosperity of the wicked, is a naturall justice which hath not yet met with a censure rigid enough to blame it. The shame which makes us blush at our advantages, or our defaults, doth look so like modesty, as their Interests are inseparable; she serves for an orna|ment to vertue, and for an expiation to sin; be it that her Father be infamous, or her mother glorious, the daughter is always e|qually honourable; and if a man be too blame in having committed sin, he is to be praised in witnessing his shame, for having com|mitted it.</P>
<P>But let Philosophers be as carefull as she pleaseth in praising of our passions, they have lost their innocency, since nature hath lost her purity. The justest of them are irregular, and those which seem to side with vertue, are slaves to sin; their first motions are out of our power; let us take what care we can to reduce them to their duty; they get on wing without our leave; they are sub|jects to whom rebellion is naturall, <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Quemadmo|dum ratione nul lum animal ob|temper at sife|rum sit.

the Fable, they draw strength from their weaknesse, and courage from their defeats: there is no passion in man which doth not set upon some vertues; oft-times they conspire together to fight a|gainst them. They reconcile their own differences, that they may ruine them; and as the Elements use violence upon their qualities, to preserve nature; these force their inclinations to destroy her. Their peace is more fatall to us than war; &amp; we know not, that whe|ther they be more to be dreaded when they adopt themselves to our humours, or when they oppose our desires. The best of them (the state considered wherein they are put by sin) are almost always irregular, the most innocent of them seem to be somwhat crimi|nall; and those which men mix with the vertues, have always some affinity with vice: the greatest part of their motions are violent, unlesse they be reformed to grace; and whatsoever advantage mo|rality may promise unto her selfe by them, she findes by her experi|ence, that it is never good sporting with a wilde beast, though it ap|pear never so tame. Naturall pity is almost always unjust; she consi|dereth the pain, but not the offence; <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Misericordia non causam sed fortunam spe|ctat, lacbrymis nocentissimorum movetur quae si liceret carcerem effringeret. <HI>Se|nec. 2. de Cle|ment. cap.</HI> 5.</NOTE> she would break open prison, to let murtherers loose; and guilty men cease to be odious to her, if once they become miserable. Indignation is not much more just than pity; she complaines of the prosperity of the wicked, and of the good mans adversity, onely because she knows not that riches and honours are not the true rewards of vertue; and that shame and poverty are not the true punishments of sin. She is onely severe because she is blinde; she would not condemne the secrets of Gods providence, if she were conversant with the laws of justice, and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>o</HI> Plures pudore peccandi quam bona voluntate prohibit is absti|nent. <HI>Senec.

The desire of glory made him swim in his Enemies blood; this passion was augmented by good successe, victory ingaged him in new Battails; the more fortunate he was, the more was he insolent; had not death stopt the course of his con|quests, he would have made all Nature groan: <HI>Asia Europe</HI> and <HI>Af|frica</HI> would have had but one and the same Tyrant; and his Subjects ruine would have been the onely proof of his authority. <HI>Adams</HI> fault never appeared more than in <HI>Alexander;</HI> we should not beleeve that our father aspired to make himself God, if this his Son had not imitated him; and we should hardly beleeve that man in the state of innocency had any proud desires, had not this Prince had insolent thoughts in the state of sin. The world seemed too little to his am|bition, his Vanity thought Usurpation lawfull, and he was so blind|ed with passion as that he thought it no the every to plunder a king|dom, or Murther to Defeate an Army.</P>
<P>By all this discourse tis easie to inferre, that the passions are re|bels which are partiall in their siding with sin, and which are never so much assubjected to the Soul, but that they are alwaies ready to obviate her Power, and ruine her authority: They are like the <HI>Prae|torian</HI> Souldiers, who made merry with their Princes heads, who made and unmade their Sovereignes, onely in reference to their
<PB N="207" REF="121">
own interest; who gave the Empire to those, who offered most for it, and who made no election which began not with murther: for these heady giddy Subjects have no other motion than either their own pleasure or proffit; they obey not reason, save onely when they like her commands, and to reap any profit by them, they must be won either by threates or promises; they help us, onely in hurting us; they do rather occasion the exercising our vertue, then assist the practice thereof; and as if they were of the devils humour, they advance our wellfare only, in labouring our losse; their assistance is almost alwayes pernitious; they must be used as the Poets say <HI>Aeolus</HI> used the windes; threates must be used with the orders which we give them; They are like those horses in the chariot of the sun in <HI>Ovid;</HI> they must be be roughly dealt withall before they reduced; and their Nature must be changed, ere their violence be overcome. Anger turnes to fury when not moderated; desire and hope go astray when not regulated; Audacity grows rash, when not held in; and sorrow turns to despaire, when not sweetened; so as all passions in|struct us, that Nature is corrupted by sin; and that to assubject them to reason, a Man must guide himself by the motions of Grace.</P>

<HEAD>The fifth Discourse.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>That the health of Man is prejudiced by sicknesse.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AMongst a thousand differences which distinguish Christian Grace from originall righteousnesse, one of the chiefest is, that the former sanctifies the Souls onely, and the other did sanctifie the whole man, and wrought admirable effects in his body. For in the profession of Christianity, the senses are yet Subject to the Illusions of the Devil, objects do yet move the passions; and reason is oft surprised by their motions. The Sacraments do not warrant us from death, and the remedies which Jesus Christ hath left unto his Church do not cure our sicknesses. But in the state of innocency, originall righteousnes was a plentifull spring-head which
<PB N="208" REF="122">
dispersed abroad its rivulets into both the parts which go to the composure of man. For it brought fidelity to the senses, obedience to the passions, and peace to the Elements; hence it was, that man preserving his advantages, <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 words"> in hoc corpore mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tali incipit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">otare. <HI>Au|gust.</HI></NOTE> was exempt from sicknesse and death: The seasons not being yet irregular, nothing could alter his temper, and his humours being uncorrupted, nothing could have prejudiced his health: But with the losse of his innocency, he lost all his privi|ledges and he was no sooner sinfull, but he began to be sick.</P>
<P>This is so constant a truth, as that mans life is nothing but a long sicknesse which never ends but in death: he is born in sorrow aswell as in sin; his entrance into the world is no lesse painfull, then shamefull; if this monster like the viper, rip up the bowells of his Mother, he himself feels a part of the pain, which he makes her suffer, and he runs as much danger, as she who brings him into the world. Therefore tis that Saint <HI>Austin</HI> sayes handsomly, that to be born, is to begin to suffer, and that to live in the body is to begin to be sick: The disorder of seasons is sufficient to corrupt the best constitutions, and the Alterations which happen in the world make such impressions in the Body as trouble the temper thereof. Though Nature be a wise Mother, that she prepare us for the Summers heat by the moderate warmth of the spring, and that she fits us for the winters cold by the moistnesse of <HI>Autumn,</HI> yet is the body of man so weak as notwithstanding all these precautions, she cannot free it from incommodity; Physicians themselves observe, that every season brings with it its maladie: and that ruling over such humours as accord with them, they never suffer us to enjoy perfect health.</P>
<P>The Elements agree not better than do the seasons, there is al|wayes some one of them which predominates to the prejudice of the rest, they commit outrages each upon other; and as bloud and chol|ler, discharge themselves when over heated; flegme and Melan|cholly do the like when they are corrupted; their good intelligence is fatall to man; this calm threatens him with a terrible storm, and he is never nearer sicknesse, than when in perfectest health; besides these incommodities which spring from his temper, there are others which proceed from indigencie, and which oblige him every day to seek for cure, he is dayly tormented with hunger and thirst, <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ames natu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> est <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">dam <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rbus, quia Natura sacta est <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">na. <HI>August in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">7.</NOTE> and these are so pressing maladies, as he cannot defer their reme|dies
<PB N="209" REF="122">
without hazarding his life. Naturall heat commits spoil in the body which ought to be repaired. The fire which inanimates us, consumes us, and if it be not furnisht with nourishment to enter|tain it, it dischargeth it's fury upon the radicall moisture which pre|serves us. 'Tis a lamp that goes out when left without oyle; and a man is so corrupted since sin, as that which we call life, is but a long death; and that which is termed health, is but a continuall sicknesse. Nature is become our punishment, every part of our bo|dy is bound by the Justice of God to punish us; so as not needing executioners for the satisfaction thereof, it findes enough in our selves to revenge itselfe of us.</P>
<P>The sicknesses wherewith we are afflicted; <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Sanitas corpo|ris est corum qui|bus componitur concordia, &amp; ejus agrotatio, corum discor|dia, <HI>August.</HI></NOTE> arise from the mix|ture of the Elements; though the seasons were not unseasonable, and though the heavens should have no bad influences, we should not cease to suffer; our bodily temper suffers for the irregularity of our soules; and there are some evils turned into nature; insomuch as we cannot live without them; Thirst is as usuall as hunger, this malady, though it be violent, ceaseth not to be naturall; those who are never troubled therewithall, passe either for Angels, or for Monsters; History ranks it in the number of Prodigies; and men are more astonished to see a man that did never drink, than to see a man that did never laugh: yet this so common punishment is so cruell, as in five or six days it destroys the strongest men, and makes the most couragious accept of dishonourable conditions. Pla|ces which can defend themselves against force, cannot defend them|selves against thirst; and the fire which consumes the entrails, is of more efficacy, than that which blows up walls and bulwarks. Wat|ching is not much lesse unsupportable than thirst. Tyrants have put malefactors to death by keeping them from sleep. Man must have re|course to sleep to refresh himselfe, and must seek to preserve his life in the image of death. If he neglect this remedy, he languish|eth away, and his very soule which delights in motion, hath need of this rest, to re-assume it's vigour. But all these evills are but pa|stimes or sports, in comparison of these which are occasioned by our debaucheries. The stone and gout are punishments which may almost vye with those of the damned, they sieze on the most sen|sible parts of the body; had they not their intermissions they would cast men into despair; and to free themselves from it, the lawes
<PB N="210" REF="123">
of the Ancients ought to be revived; which permitted the mi|serable to die.</P>
<P>All the parts of the body hath maladies which assail them; there is not any one which hath not some peculiar torments. The eye which is one of the least, though not of least importancy, is subject to a|bove an hundred severall diseases; the nerves which give them mo|tion, and through which they receive light, are as capable of ob|struction, as those by which the armes and legs are moved; the smaller they be, the more susceptible they are of pain, and by how much the parts of the body are the most noble; they seem to be the more painfull. The least hurt in the heart is mortall; and the throne wherein the soule resides is so fraile, as a very vapour is capable to crack it. In fine, the best Physician, who knew not that a man was sinfull, wondred he should be so miserable; and considering his mi|series, confest he was wholly a disease. <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Totus homo totus morbus est.</NOTE> The soule, which is the bo|dies guest, is also it's executioner; the ones agitations trouble the others humours; great men have little health, the great designes which purchases them so much glory, leaves them but little quiet. Violent agitations alter the constitutions more than the countenance, more men dye of anger and griefe, than by the hands of the hang|man; lovers, and ambitious men are always in a Fever: the fire which inflames them, consumes them; and the Physician who deals with their body cannot cure their sicknesse, till Philosophy which guides their mindes hath allayed their passions. The soules delights are the bodies punishments, and the same meditation which enligh|tens the understanding, and heats the will, disorders the temper, and alters the constitution; thus the whole life of man, is nothing but a vexatious sicknesse, his noblest operations serve him for punishments, and he cannot purchase knowledge but by the losse of his health.</P>
<P>If the maladies be vexatious, the remedies are not more pleasing. Physick teacheth, that the remedies which she furnisheth us withall, are but prepared venomes; she cannot drive out sicknesses, but by poisons; and to cure those that are sick, she must seek for Antidotes in the bowels of vipers. She is so unfortunate in her cures, as she cannot assaile the disease, without hurting the party diseased; nor can she strengthen the diseased party without augmenting the dis|ease. These two maximes which divide the school of physick, are are equally dangerous: for be it that you will drive away the disease
<PB N="211" REF="123">
by it's contrary, or that you will cure nature by it's like, you must either weaken the sick party <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Omnis medi|cina aut Natu|ra amica, aut mali inimica esse debet. <HI>Arist.</HI></NOTE> whil'st you think to destroy his dis|ease, or else increase the disease, whil'st you strengthen the party that is sick: so as the remedies are as dangerous as displeasing; and we hazard our life as oft as we endeavour to recover health. Hence proceeds the aversions which sick people have to physick; hence proceeds the Philosophers invectives, against the fear of death, and the desire of life; which oblige us to endeavour remedies, which are more cruell than the evills which they promise to cure.</P>
<P>For there is the difference between nature and physick; the for|mer remedies are pleasing, the others nauseous. Viands which satis|fie our hunger are so conformable to our temperature, as they expell the evill with delight, and repaires the ruine thereof without pain. Wine appeaseth thirst with so much contentment, as that drunkards are delighted in the remedy, and wish to be thirsty, that they may have the contentment of being cured; this sort of drink is so pleasing to them, as not staying till they have need thereof, they seek it out meerly for pleasures sake; and violate the laws of nature, which hath made it pleasing onely because 'tis necessary. Sleep charms our wearinesse with so much of content, as though it be the picture of death, no man doth abhor it: the slothfull ground their felicity thereon and those who do most desire to live, take de|light in dying oft and long. A man must be sick to have an aversion of these remedies, and either our health is interessed, or our taste depraved, when meat displeaseth us: <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Remedia nul|l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> sunt tam sa|lutaria quam quae faciunt dolorem.</NOTE> but physick is so severe in her operations, as she never undertakes to cure us, without offending some of oursenses; all her remedies are torments; if she restore us to health, we must undergoe pain ere we come by it; she hurts us to cure us, nor hath she yet found the receipt how to make her poti|ons pleasing: the sweetest things in her hands, become either dead or bitter, sugar and honey do distaste us, when prepared by her; and she is so unfortunate in all her designes, as she weakens her reme|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s when she thinks to make them appear pleasing.</P>

save the rest of the body; she draws the stone out of the bladder, with such torture, as seems to equall that of the damned; and she is either so cruell, or so unfortunate, as she cannot make men whole, without making them Martyrs; a life accompanied with so much pain, cannot be very pleasing; health so dearly bought, cannot be much delightfull; and a man must be stupid, if he do not equally apprehend the malady, and the cure. <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Abominan|dum est genus remedii sanita|tem debere mor|bo, <HI>Senec&punc; l b. 1. de It&acirc; c.</HI> 12.</NOTE> We see nothing in the world which ought not to cause horrour in us.

<P>'Tis true, that if we more value Gods glory, then our own inter|est, we shall finde contentment in our pain; for his justice is satisfied by our sicknesse, his power appears in our infirmities, and his mercies are seen in our recoveries.

through the Corps du-Guards, threw themselves into <HI>Pharaohs</HI> Pa|lace, and passing even to his private Closet, whereunto he had with|drawn himself, did in their croking voice upbraid unto him his pride and infidelity. But this so mighty miracle comes short of that which Divine Justice shews in the sicknesses of the earthly Monarches, grashoppers are not so dreadfull in his hands, as are fevers and contagious diseases; and if he appeared adorable when he revenged himself upon his enemies by flyes and frogs, he is no lesse the same when he stings the nerves by the Gout; When by a grain of sand he stops the uritaries; or, when by a vapour which assailes the brains he puts a period to the designes of the greatest Princes of the world. Grashoppers are the works of his hands, he imploys the beautifullest of all constellations to form them, and he gives them meadows to walk in, and disport themselves, but sicknesses are the daughters of sin, and mothers of death. Being the spring of Rebellion, they ought not render obedience to God; and not being the workmanship of his Power, they ought not to serve his justice; yet he imployes them to punish the Rebels of his Kingdom; he useth them as State Policies, and not making use of fire or water, he commands the Fever or the Goute, to set upon Princes in their Pallaces, to mow down their Subjects, and to turn the most populous Towns, into dread|full desarts; if these faithfull Officers doe sometime serve his Ju|stice; they are also sometimes <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Quosd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> multa peccare posse <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">firmitate cor|poris ne pec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, ut eis utili<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> sit frangi <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> gu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|ribus ad salu|tem, quam re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|nere incolumes ad da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">atio|nem, <HI>Hugo lib. 1 de anima.</HI></NOTE> serviceable to his mercy; for sick|nesses do losen us from the earth, they bereave us of the use of pleasure, and taking from us the power of doing ill, they make us forgo the desire thereof; they change the love we bear unto our body into a holy aversion, they ruin sin whereof they are the ef|fects, and rendring obedience to Gods designs, they cure the man, by hurting the Malefactour.</P>

<HEAD>The sixth Discourse.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>That the bodies beauty is become perishable and criminall.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>A Man must be blinde if he value not beauty; her advantages are so visible, as she is, sure to have the better if her judges have eyes; Beauty is the first perfection which is seen in any one, and which steals away the heart of the beholders. She doth so powerfull forestall the understanding, as we cannot harbour an ill opinion of a handsome personage; and since we are perswaded that the works of Nature are perfect, we are apt to beleeve, that she hath inclosed a fair Soul in a handsome body. <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ulgor boni|tatis pulcbritu|do, <HI>Plato in convi.</HI></NOTE> Tis therefore that the <HI>Platonicks</HI> terme beauty the luster of Goodnesse, and will have her to be the visible Image of an invisible perfection; she hath such power over humane Judgement, as good fortune cannot be expected where there is no handsomenesse. Angels finde their contentment in beholding the beauty of God. Devils think themselves onely unfortunate for having lost the hope of enjoying it, and though it be the cause of their torments, yet is the object of their desires. This perfection ravisheth the will so readily, as the sight of her is sufficient to make her be beloved, she oft-times changeth hatred in|to love, and to make her power appear, she delights to make her Enemies her Lovers. We have heard of a daughter that fell in love with him that murthered her Father: the handsome comportment of this Prince blotted all hatred out of her heart, and the beauty which appeared in his countenance forced her to love him, whom by nature and reason she was bound to hate. <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> eti|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">m <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rbaricae <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ver <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tur, &amp; ad <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">bilem <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">spectum <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> oc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|suescit. <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">l Jo|vius hist. lib.</HI> 5.</NOTE> Barbarians bear respect unto her, fair personage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> pass amongst them as deities, and the lovers of beauty were the first Idolaters.</P>
<P>The command which she exerciseth over men is so powerfull, and so pleasing, as they are pleased with the losse of their liberty, and contrary to the humour of slaves, they love their Irons, and cherish their prisons: could Kings use this art to make themselues be obeyed, they should never know what revolts were, and all their

There was but one Heretique who mis-in|terpreting the words <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Passiones qui|dem humanam Christi caruem, contumeliae in|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">onestam proba|vere. <HI>Tertul. de carne Chri|sti.</HI></NOTE> of a Prophet imagined that Jesus Christ was deformed, but tradition upheld by reason, teacheth us that he was beautifull without art, that the Holy Ghost who formed his body in the Virgins womb would have it adorned with comlinesse, <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Speciosus for|ma prae filiis hominum, <HI>Psal.</HI> 44.</NOTE> and that nothing might be wanting to his workmanship, he exceeded men in this advantage, as well as in all others. His very Types in the old testament were all comely. <HI>Solomon</HI> and <HI>David,</HI> the one of which represented his victories, the other his Triumphs, were both of them famous for their beauty; Nature seemed as if she would picture forth in them the Messias, to satisfie the just desires of those who could not see him. The Angels took upon them his visage when they treated with the Prophets; whilest they spoke in his name they would appeare in his form, <HI>Abraham</HI> saw him in that Glory, wherein he appeared on <HI>Mount Tabor,</HI> and numbred this vi|sion amongst the chiefest favours he had received from Heaven. <HI>Iacob</HI> had the honour to see him in the person of that Angell which wrestled with him, before the break of day; <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg"><HI>David</HI> erat rufus &amp; vald<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> pulcher, 1 <HI>Reg.</HI></NOTE> the three Children which were thrown into the fiery furnace, saw him amidst the flames; his presence freed them from fear, they found paradise in the picture of Hell; and that Angell which bore the visage of Jesus Christ, broke their Irons in pieces, preserved their vestures, and pu|nished their Enemies. In fine, Jesus Christ lost not his lovelinesse till he lost his life, the Luster of his countenance was not effaced, till by buffetting, his face grew not pale, till by stripes, and he lost not that Majesty which infused respect into his Enemies, till the bloud which distild from his wounds had made him an object of compassion and horrour.</P>
<P>In fine, beauty is so amiable, as her enemy is odious; all the Mon|sters whereby the world receives dishonour, are composed of ugli|nesse:
<PB N="216" REF="126">
'Tis an effect of sin, which corrupts the workmanship of God, had there been no ^l <NOTE PLACE="marg">Quarti species <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> similis filio Dei, <HI>Daniel.</HI></NOTE> sinner, there had been no deformed Creature.  Grace and beauty were inseparable in the estate of originall righte|ousnesse. Nothing was seen in the Terrestiall paradise which offen|ded the eies; all things were pleasing there, because all things there were innocent. There was no deformity known in the world till af|ter sin; Il-favourednesse is the daughter and the picture of sin, and 'tis a piece of injustice to hate the copy, and to love the originall.</P>
<P>Albeit these reasons oblige us to reverence beauty where accom|panied with Innocency, yet have we as much and as just cause to fear her, since she is mingled with impurity, For sin hath left no|thing in nature uncorrupted; this Monster is pleased in setting up|on the most Glorious works of nature, and knowing that their chiefest ornament lay in their beauty, hath pickt out her more per|ticularly to discharge it's fury upon. There are none of nature works now, which have not some notable defaults.

<P>The first Christian women, who very well knew the misfortune which accompanied this advantage, did gallantly despise it, they were ashamed to be handsome, they neglected what our women so much value, they thought it a fault, to heighten a perfection, which produceth lewd desires; the purest amongst them wisht that old age might free them of this domestick enemy, the most zealous did set upon it in the flower of their youth, and revenged themselves upon their own countenances, for the unchast thoughts which they without design had caused: they never appeared in publick unvailed, they <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Tam sancti viri est suffundi si virginem vi|derit, quam sanctae virginis si &agrave; viro visa sit.

They would not cause love for fear of receiving it; they were so scrupnlous, as they thought their chastity blemisht by mens eyes; that as fruits lose their verdure if once toucht, a woman lost her chastity if once seen; and that since adultery begins by the eyes, sight was as much to be shun'd as touching they remembred, that their beauty was cause of scandall in Heaven, and interpreting the Scripture according to the letter, they feared to cause love in men, since they imagined their mothers had done the like in Angels.

<P>If the example of these famous women cannot reform the disor|der of those of our age, yet ought they at least to think, that beauty is no lesse dangerous to those that possesse it, than to those that covet it, that it is exposed to temptations, and environed with scandals, that if it be not the cause of sin, it is the occasion thereof, and that if

So many bad suc|cesses made the Devill have recourse to his old tricks. He com|manded his partners by the mouth of a faithless Prophet, to set upon those with women, whom he could not overcome by men; and to make use of beauty where strength was bootlesse.

<P>In fine, beauty is so pernicious, as God himself who extracts Grace from sin, makes use thereof onely to punish his Enemies, it is more dreadfull in his hands then thunder, and he hath tane more venge|ance by womens allurements, then by the arms of souldiers.

He imployed the eloquence of Orators to perswade Infidels, he made use of the doctrine of Philosophers to convince the ignorant, he u|seth the power of Kings to reduce rebels, and he imployes the wise|dome of Politicians to govern states, but he rejects beauty, and judging her to hold Intelligence with his enemy, he never makes use thereof, but to undo sinners.

<P>In the State of innocencie grace linkt the Soul to the body; death unseconded by sin could not break the chains; the elements durst not assail him, originall righteousnesse made them observe re|spect, they appeased their differences, lest they might trouble mans temper; fire agreed with water to preserve his health, &amp; there was as profound a peace in his person as in his state, but since he fore|went his duty, grace abandoned his body to sin, the elements had liberty given them to war one upon another, man became the scene of their combates, and after once he revolted from God, he saw all creatures take up arms against him, <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Omnis vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> est, <HI>Sence.</HI></NOTE> sorrow &amp; death set upon him, he was sentenced to live in pain, &amp; die in sorrow.

There is no rose which is not graf|ted upon a thousand thornes, and how handsome soever the chains be which link the soule and body together, they are both of them equally exposed to suffering.</P>
<P>The soule is more capable of sadnesse, than of joy; though she display her selfe to receive in pleasure, yet doth she never taste it purely; she weeps amidst her contentments, she expresseth her joy by sighs, and as if she were not accustomed to great happinesses, she seems to suffer when she receives them. Though she shut the doore upon sorrow, yet suffers she her selfe to be easily siezed on by it; though she resist it, she cannot withstand it; <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Segnius bo|mines bona <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> mala sen|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ant.</NOTE> and as if nature had made her more sensible of misery, than of happinesse; a small dis|pleasure is able to make her forget all her former contentments.

of pain. Pleasures do enter-shock, and always leave some of our senses in languishment or need; pains agree in their assailing us, and though they should not come in a crowd, one alone is sufficient to make it selfe be felt by all the parts of the body; their straight union makes their mischiefes common, and if the head suffer, the tongue complains; the eyes weep, and the heart groanes. Thus the happiest life is miserable, and that moment passeth not wherein we are not inforced to bewail our innocency, &amp; to condemn our sin.</P>
<P>Death comes in to the aid of pain, and by an ingenious peece of cruelty, agrees with life to augment our miserie. For though they appear to be enemies, they joyn in our punishment, and joyn with Gods Justice to revenge God; <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Quotidie mo|rimur, aliqua pars vitae demi|tur, &amp; tunc quoque cum cre|scimus vita de|crescit.

As soon as we begin to live, we begin to die. Death shares with us in all the moments of our life, it takes unto it selfe what is past, because that is certain, and leaves to us only what is to come, because that is uncertain. So as by a strange mis-fortune, the increase of our life is the diminution thereof. The farther we grow from our birth, the nearer we grow to death: our purchases are meer losses, ^m and things are so disposed of since sin, as we cannot count our years without either flattering our selves, or lying.</P>
<P>Tis perhaps for this reason that the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> (that holy language which the blessed shall make use of in heaven) imployes but one and the same word to expresse both life and death, with the difference of one only point, to teach us, that death and life, are divided onely by that moment which unites them. In effect life is nothing but a brittle chaine consisting of three links, the past, the present, and the fu|ture; the past, is no more, we retain but a weak remem|brance of it; all the vows we can make will not fetch it backe; it is not void of doubt, whether Gods absolute power, which finds no resistance amongst his creatures, can ga|ther together the present with that which is past, and unite these differences of times without destroying their essence. The future time is not as yet, hope which expects it cannot advance it, and wis|dom which hath an eye unto it, cannot dissipate the obscurity there|of; it is lesse at our disposall then the time that is past, and for all the vain conjectures which we may flatter our selves withall, we know
<PB N="228" REF="132">
not whether it shall come to us, or we shall go to it; the present time, to say truth is in our power, we are masters of it; and it is the onely thing which we can say we possesse, tis the onely part of our life which we are assured of, and who promiseth himself more is ei|ther ignorant or impious. But this present time is but a moment, and this difference of time hath no parts; time past, &amp; time to come, com|prehend whole ages, but the present consists but in an instant; so as death and life differ only in a point, &amp; these two which we judge so contrary are intertained by that moment, which doth separate them.</P>
<P>Though I honour this imagination by reason of the gallantry ther|of, and that respect w^c^h I bear to the Hebrew Tongue, obliege me to reverence it, yet me thinks it doth not sufficiently expresse the mise|ries of life whose alliance with death is neerer then is thereby repre|sented; death subsists only by life, and life is only preserved by death: they commence &amp; end together, as soon as a man begins to live, he be|gins to die, nature which very well knows that two moments never subsist together, Commands death to hurry away the one to leave to life the other that ensues. As she doth with moments and houres, so doth she with those years whereof the degrees of our life are com|posed. <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Incrementa ipss si bene com|putes damna sunt. <HI>Senec. ad Marc.</HI></NOTE> She makes our infancie die to give life to our Boyish age; she takes away a childe to substitute a man, and robs us of our youth, to make old age succeede.

<HEAD>The eighth Discourse.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>That death is the punishment of sin.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>OF all the pains which sin hath procured us, death is the most cruell and the most common; all others have their reme|dies, and self-love teacheth us how to shun them; we by our industry and labour overcome the earths sterility. We fence our selves from the shame of our nakednesse by the means of our clothes; we save our selves from the injury of the aire, and unsea|sonablenesse of weather by the commodiousnesse of buildings; physick furnisheth us with remedies against sicknesse, and reformeth our temper by the government which it prescribes us; Arts are in|vented onely to free us from the miseries of life; and the greatest part of Artificers labour onely to fence men from the punishment of sin. But death is a punishment as rigorous, as inevitable; hu|mane wit hath not yet been able to free man from it. All her care cannot make a man live a hundred years; our first fathers lived longer, and the heavens which would people the earth by their means, prolonged their life to allow them leisure for it: but they died after some hundred years, and the oldest amongst them could not attain to a thousand years.</P>
<P>The rigour of this punishment doth equall it's necessity, for death is deafe to pitty, tears cannot appease it, and whatsoever
<PB N="232" REF="134">
causeth either respect or pitty in us, cannot stay the fury thereof. It enters Princes Palaces, <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Non mise<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e|tur mors <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> non re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> eretur divitias, non sapienti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 words"> non ae|tati denique parcit, nisi quod seni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s est in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">uve|nibus vero in ins<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">is. <HI>Bern. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> Serm.</HI></NOTE> as well as shepheards cottages; it knaps in two the Scepters of Kings with as much insolency as the shepherds crook; it keeps no other law than what is prescribed unto it by di|vine Justice; it siezeth on the son before the father, the daughter before the mother; sets upon Infants in the cradle, or Monarchs in their Thrones, and on Judges on their Tribunalls. There is no sanctuary against it's fury, and those who can pardon the condem|ned cannot obtain the like favour from death. There are many prodigies in the world whereat we wonder, and there is nothing so strange, whereof there hath not been some example which fa|cilitates our beliefe&punc; there be some whole intire Provinces where the Inhabitants li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e so happily, as that they are never troubled with sicknesse; there are some so auspicious Climates, as that in them the plague doth never mow down men, where the ground is not made sterill through <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">amine; and whereas thunder never falls upon the guilty head: <HI>France</HI> cannot nourish Monsters, nor are her houses at any time shaken with earthquakes. Some men are seen to grow old, yet not grow gray; and women who preserve their comelinesse in their age, and lose it not but with losse of life. <HI>Italy</HI> hath mountains whose entrailes are full of fire, and their heads covered with snow, as if nature took delight in according these two contraries; and by ending their differences to make her power appear. But how fantasticall soever this mother hath pleased to shew her selfe, what ever diversity she hath put in her workman|ships to delight us, and what ever miracles she hath wrought to astonish us, she could never free man from death. The devill who promised us immortallity to engage us in disobedience, could not make good his word, <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Didicitque <HI>Achilles,</HI> &amp; D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ates mori <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ade</HI></NOTE> and the law which bindes us to die, is too generall to admit of any dispensation, or exception. When God himselfe became man, he became mortall, and taking our nature upon him, he would not exempt himselfe from death. All Gods friends have born this punishment; the justest have oft-times lived the shortest life, and death to astonish others hath made examples of them, if some have been rapt up to Paradise, that favour did not be|reave death of his rights, for after having lived a long time with Angels, they shall descend on earth again to die there with men.</P>
<P>This rigour would be pleasing were it not accompanied with

circumstances which make it unsupportable, but death assumes fearfull shapes to affrighten us, he is not content to part our soules from our bodies, to break in two the chains which did unite them, and to destroy Gods chiefest workmanship, but to satisfie his cruel|ty, &amp; tire our patience, he assumes a thousand frightfull shapes, <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Tres sunt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> mortis, ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">us infirmi|tas, senectus Casus dubia; in|firmitas gra|via; senectu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> certa denunti|at.

He appears hideous even in the beautifullest visage that ever was; he shrinks up the nerves, hollows the eyes, defaceth the complexion, alters the lineaments, and turns a miraculous beauty into a dreadfull Monster. Somtimes he burnes the bowels by the scorching heat of a fever, somtimes swels up the body by a long continued dropsie, somtimes he makes an anatomy, or skeleton thereof, by an irksome consumption, somtimes forms strange characters in the lungs or brain, somtimes he covers the face over with an ulcer, and changes the Throne of beauty into the Seat of deformity.</P>
<P>Violent deaths are yet more uncoucht than such as are naturall; they are not to be beheld without terrour, and those who have cou|rage enough to tolerate the gout or stone, have not constancy enough to endure the torture of fire&punc; or rack; 'tis therefore that it is said, that our father <HI>Adam</HI> knew not the heinousnesse of his sin, till he saw the picture of death in <HI>Abels</HI> face; the losse of grace, Gods anger, the Angels indignation, his banishment from Paradise, the creatures revolt, the alteration of seasons, warring of Elements, nor yet the insurrection of the body against the soule, were not suf|ficient to make known unto him the exorbitancy of his sin, nor the injustice of his disobedience: but when he saw his son want moti|on, his eyes want light, when he heard no words proceed from his mouth, saw no colour in his face, nor felt no motion of his heart, he thought his sin was very great since it deserved so sore a punishment.</P>
<P>To say truth, <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Stipendium peccati mors. Primegen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ta peccati. <HI>Paul.</HI></NOTE> death is the image of sin, this father makes himselfe seen in his daughter, his uglinesse is seen in his pro|duction, and there needs no more to acknowledge the misery of a sinner, than to consider the aspect of a dead man. Those pale lips, those sunk eyes, those hollowed cheeks, and that corruption which always accompanies stench, is the shadow of a soule which mortall sin hath bereaved of innocency and grace. All teacheth us that we are criminall, and that the evills which we endure, are as
<PB N="234" REF="135">
well the portraitures of our punishments, as of our offences. The rebellion which we meet withall in the Elements, and creatures is the punishment of our disobedience; the irregularity of the sea|sons is a signe of the disorder of our passions; the blinding of our eyes proves the like in our understanding, and the sicknesses which our bodies suffer under, are the effects of our souls infirmity: but of all the punishments wherewith we are afflicted, death is the onely true copy of sin, and in this copy it is that we must observe the hor|rour of the originall.</P>
<P>To discover all his rigours, we must examine the terme of our sen|tence, we must consider what punishments he condemned us unto, and observe with how many evills he threatens us. <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">In quacun&abque; die comederis ex eo, morte morie|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s. <HI>Genes.</HI> 2.</NOTE> The first is to die the same day that we have sinned, and to bear the punish|ment as soon as we have committed the offence.

For death holds so good intelligence with life, as these do equally part our years; we perish for our preservation; as soon as we enter into our boyes estate, we forgoe infancy, we divide every houre of the day between death and life, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Quare &agrave; sene, ubi pueritia, u|bi infantia, ubi ann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, ubi men|ses&punc; beu periere. <HI>Ad Mart.

<P>The second punishment which our decree bringeth, is that in not expressing what kind of death we shall die, we are obliged to fear all sorts of death. There is nothing more certain than this punish|ment; neither is there any thing more secret. Every one knows he must die, every day affords us proofs and examples of it; our friends and enemies confirme this truth, no man is so ignorant, or vain-glorious as to doubt it; the sepulchres of Kings are faithfull witnesses thereof, and those heads for which the lives of a whole Nation are exposed, make us see that death spares no body; but the manner thereof is as unknown, as the hour is uncertain. The stars do not shew the particulars thereof, and unlesse the heavens re|veale it, the devill cannot foretell it to those that serve him; our decree pitcheth not upon any one, that we may stand in fear of all; and after the example of Princes which have ended their lives by deaths, from which their qualities ought to have warranted them, we may justly apprehend all. It may be 'twill be naturall, it may be violent; it may be 'twill sieze on us in war, it may be in peace, it may be 'twill be short and cruell, it may be lesse cruell, but lan|guishing; the Judge which hath condemned us, hath not been pleased to expresse himselfe therein, to the end, that the fear of death might be a severer punishment unto us, then death it selfe; it may suffice us to know that he is incensed, and that we may justly expect from his just anger whatsoever death our sin deserves. The truth is we can suffer but one; the weaknesse of our constitution doth not permit both the waters to drown us, the fire to burn us, and the wilde beasts to devoure us, but the darknesse of our decree obligeth us to fear all these punishments, <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Erge tu i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> tantis erroribu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> es ut existimes Deos mortium signi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> praemitte|re, &amp; quidquam in terris ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> magnum esse ut qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> perire mundus sciat. <HI>Senec. lib. 1.

Thus doth our supream Judge deal with guilty man; he drives him out of the terrestiall paradise, and banisheth him into the world; he threatens the place of his exile to be totally consumed with fire, for having received this guilty person; he confiscates all his goods, takes from him all the honourable marks of his great|nesse, and reduceth him to the condition of beasts, who did pre|tend to the glory of Angels; he makes all his subjects despise his authority, he makes his slaves either Rebels, or Tyrants, and af|ter so many punishments, he shortens his shamefull life, by some tragicall end.

nor the flames devour them; being innocent, he will not deal with them as guilty, death spares their body after having separated it from their soul, they seem to rest in their graves, to repose themselves af|ter their labour, and to expect with joy that dreadfull day which all the guilty do apprehend.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>What advantages we may draw from death, by the means of Grace.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THough death be the first production of sin, and that the malice and deformed lothsomnesse of the Father appear in Sons visage, some Philosophers have gone about to make apologies for death, and after having made use of their reason in the defence thereof, they have imployed their cunning in praising it. Being ignorant of the <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Lex est non poena perire. <HI>Senec.</HI></NOTE> first mans fault, they would have death to be a law, and not a punishment; they have excused his rigour by his necessity, and have gone about to perswade us, that he was pleasing, because necessary. All things in nature perish, this mother hath brought forth nothing which she hath not sentenced to die, nothing is immortall, and few things durable: fountains grow dry, and their spring-heads are either lost, orstrayed out of the channel; the mountaines give way to the violence of floods, the sea advances and wins upon the earth, whole isles have sunke into the earth, we see lakes now where our Ancestours have seen Towns, and husband|men plough up fields, where Pilots have steerd their ships; The Change which preserves Nature is a kinde of death; nature subsists onely by alteration, were it not, <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Ita est nihil perpetuum, pauca di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">turn&punc; sunt, aliud al o modo fragile est: rerum exi|tus variantur: caeterum quid|quid coepit, &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">. <HI>Senec. ad Polyb. in initio.</HI></NOTE> for change she would utterly pe|rish; kingdomes (which apprehend nothing like vicissitude) cannot shun it; as oft as they lose their Princes, they hazard the losse of their liberty, they grow jealous of all their neighbours, and ambi|tion

is so perfidious as their allyes may become their enemies; all those great Colossuses which past for miracles in their age, their subsistance depends now only upon paper; Time hath made them know, that all the workmanship of man is perishable, and that frail hands can build nothing which is eternall. In fine, the world it self is not exempt from death; the deluge wherewith it was drown'd, and the fire wherewith it shall be consumed, teach us that it may pe|rish; the Stars which never are at a stay, are threatned one day to lose their influences and their light, the same hand which hath seat|ed them in the firmament, will one day pull them from thence; and though <HI>Aristotle</HI> imagines the heavens to be incorruptible, Jesus Christ assures us, that they shall perish together with the world. Wherefore then do we complain of death, since he spares not the Stars, and wherefore do we wish, that our houses may never have an end, since the world cannot escape the fall which threatens it.</P>

These silly people are easily comforted; they look after no priviledges, which their Ancestours have not enjoyed, they prepare for death when they see their friends die; and having no plots which may fasten them to the world, they are not troubled to be interrupted therein by their death. All men seem to conspire to be cause of astonishment to themselves, and that it fares with them, as in the route of an Army, where those that ran away, cause fear in those that fight. Every particular man frames unto himself an <HI>Idea</HI> of death, and he who can make it appear the most hideous, pas|seth for the ablest man.

Yet experience teacheth us that he takes upon himselfe pleasing formes to reclaim us; that he glides so pleasingly into the heart, as those whom he wounds, feele him not; he set upon <HI>Plato</HI> sleeping, and it was hard to discern sleep from death in this Philosopher; one of the <HI>Crassuses</HI> died laughing, and the <HI>Romans</HI> ceased to fear death, seeing it so amiable upon his face: <HI>Chilon</HI> was choked with joy; his sons victory was as fatall to him, as to the enemies of the State; and whil'st men sought for Laurell to crown the Conquerour; others sought for Capres to put upon his fathers head. <HI>Clydemus</HI> died not lesse plea|singly, since the praises which <HI>Greece</HI> gave him, were the cause of his death, and that he lost his life amidst his Triumph.</P>

We carry the principles of death about us, and from once that originall righteousnesse ceased to appease the differences between those parts whereof we are composed we began to die. It is not necessary that the world disorder it selfe, to bereave us of our lives; though the seasons should not be put out of their pace, we should not cease to perish. And if death be to be feared, we must resolve to fear life. There are some people who apprehend any thing that happens of disorder in the world, and who grow pale as often as they see rivers over-flow their banks, as often as they hear thunder, or see earth-quakes: They think that every clap of thun|der comes in pursuit of them, and that the sea exceeds not her bounds but to drown them on the earth; but the causes of our death are much lesse violent, and more naturall.

<PB N="240" REF="138">
can not subsist without miracle; and when the contrary parties do no longer agree, their division must be the ruine of what they compose. Mans immortality in the state of innocency, was not an effect of nature; he lost this priviledge as soon as he lost his righ|teousnesse, and experience taught him, that nature without grace could not keep him from death. <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Haec omnia elementa quibus mundus admi|nistratur tam causa vivendi sunt quam viae mortis. <HI>Senec.

<P>But I dare adde, that death is rather a favour, than a punishment; and that in the estate whereinto sin hath reduced man, it is not so much a mark of justice, as of mercy: the evils which we undergo considered, to live eternally, would be eternall misery; earth would become hell, and the continuance of our torments would make us wish death; which is not dreadfull save to those abused soules which think themselves happy. The miserable desire it; and as death to one who lives contentedly is a punishment, so is life to him who lives discontentedly. <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Cupidum mortis ut lu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|ret delictum vetuit mori, <HI>Tertul.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Cain</HI> desired to die, had not the heavens prolonged his life to punish his parricide; he had prevented <HI>Lamechs</HI> cruelty, and after having been his brothers murtherer, he would have been his own hangman. Poets who cloke truths under fables, have not without reason fained nature to have invented death, to oblige her children; for seeing that their offence had incensed hea|ven, that their life became a misery, that fortune intrencht upon their goods, calumny upon their innocency, and sicknesse upon their health; that the fever burnt up their entrails by unsupporta|ble heat, that the gout stung their nerves, and that they lived not but in fear and sorrow, she broke the cords wherewith the soul was fastned to the body, and ended their lives to shorten their miseries.</P>
<P>To leave fables to Infidels; is it not a constant truth amongst Christians, that life would be an eternall punishment, did not death come in to the succour of old age, <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Quid aliud ess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t homini vi|tiato aeterna vi|t qu&agrave;m aeter|n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> mise<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">iae.</NOTE> to deliver us from it? and that we should pray to go out of the world, if we were condemned to live there, after we had lost the use of our members by the pal|sey, and were grown blinde, and deaf.

rigour, and those miserable ones would finde some ease in their suf|ferings, if after many ages they were assured to die: nothing makes them despair, but that eternity of their punishment; and nothing doth so much comfort men as the shortnesse of their tortures. Ty|rants who unjustly endeavour to imitate God in justice, complain that death freed their enemies from their indignation; and that by assisting the miserable, it hindred their designes: for they very well knew, that he knows not how to revenge himselfe of his enemy, who puts him suddainly to death; and that those who will taste the pleasure of revenge, never condemne a guilty man to die till he be re-possessed of their favour. In fine, there are few who owe not thanks to death. <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Perimat ty|rann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> lenis, in regno meo mors impetratur. <HI>Se|nec. in Thyeste.</HI></NOTE> Those who fear him in prosperity, invoke him in adversity; those who shun him in opulency, seek him out in poverty; and those who list not to know his name in health, call upon him in sicknesse. He is the onely cure of the incurable, the assured succour of the afflicted, the desire and hope of the misera|ble; and of as many as implore his succour, there are none more obliged unto him, than those whose miseries and desires he pre|veneth.</P>
<P>Though these thoughts may seem uncouth to those who love life, they cease not to be approved of by Christianity; and to passe for truth amongst the faithfull. If death be rigorous because he is the punishment of sin, he is pleasing because he is the childe of the Crosse; he hath changed nature, since he was consecrated in the Person of Jesus Christ; he hath forgone those dreadfull names which caused terrour, to assume those pleasing ones which bring consolation. He is onely asleep which charms our disquiets, a pas|sage which leads us unto life, a happy shipwrack which throws us into the haven, an enemy which takes us out of prison, a Tyrant which breaks our chains, and a son of sin which furnisheth us with weapons wherewithall, to fight with, and to overcome his Father. In the state of innocency death was a punishment, wherewith di|vine Justice did threaten man; in the state of sin, it was a chastise|ment, <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Mors quae in lege Naturae e|rat poe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">a pecca|ti, sacta est in lege gratiae ho|stia pro peccato. <HI>August.</HI></NOTE> wherewith she did punish the faulty; and in the state of grace, 'tis a sacrifice, which she requires at our hands, and whereby she is appeased. Formerly, to astonish man, he was told, if thou sin|nest, thou shalt die; and now to fortifie him in persecution, it is said unto him, if thou dost not die, thou shalt sin; death which
<PB N="242" REF="139">
was a punishment is become a victime, and the sinners chastisement is become the merit of the just.</P>
<P>The Son of God hath thus instructed us by his example, when he would fight with sin, he took up no other arms than death; he thought the victory would be more honourable, wherein he should employ the son against the father, and where he should make use of the effect, to destroy the cause: <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">De peccato damnavit pec|catum. <HI>Paul.</HI></NOTE> this is that which the great Apo|stle teacheth us in these words, where he saith, that the Son of God hath overcome sin, by sin, and that in the punishment of our of|fence he hath found a remedy to cure us. Fictitious <HI>Hercules</HI> vaunts himselfe amongst the Poets, to have overcome <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Armat us ve|nit leone, &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ydr&acirc;, in <HI>Her|cul.</HI> furent.</NOTE> Monsters by other Monsters; to have made himselfe weapons by their spoils; and to have ended his last labours by the help of what he had pur|chased in the former. This fable of <HI>Hercules</HI> is become a truth in Jesus Christ; and the Gospell obligeth us to acknowledge that in the death of God, which falshood had found out in the life of man. For he by dying hath satisfied his Father, he hath destroyed sin by it's Son; he hath saved the sinner by his punishment. Religion bindes us to confesse that death is the rise of our happinesse, that it is the Christians vow; that without being miserable, they rejoyce in being mottall; and that they should want somewhat of their glory; if since Jesus Christ did lose his life upon the Crosse, they were to ascend to Heaven, without dying they live with pain, they die with pleasure; and to describe a true Christian according to <HI>Tertullians</HI> language, we must say, that they are a sort of men who are always ready to die; <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Genus homi|num morti ex|peditum. <HI>Tert. in Apologet.</HI></NOTE> and who placing their happinesse in the resemblance or imitation of Jesus Christ, desire to lose their lives a thousand times amidst tortures, to repair his charity by their love; and to suffer for his glory, what he hath undergone for their salvation.</P>

<HEAD>The tenth Discourse.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>That sleep is a punishment of sin as the image of death, and that it bereaves us of reason as dreames do of rest.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THose who think sleep the most harmlesse part of life wil ne|ver be perswaded that it hath drawn some evill qualities from <HI>Adams</HI> sin, for it seems to reduce men to the conditions of Children, and that bereaving them of the use of reason, it takes from them that unfortunate power which they by their offences a|buse. The guiltiest actions become innocent, during sleep, those va|pours which do stupifie the senses excuse the sins of those that sleep, and as their <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Et bona facta gratuita sunt in somnis, &amp; deli|cta secura. <HI>Tertul. de ani|ma.</HI></NOTE> Vertues are not rewarded, neither are their offences pu|nished. Murthers are committed without effusion of blood, revenge is taken upon enemies without injustice, and another mans goods are without violence tane away whilst sleep doth lull the senses. The soul is not guilty of the faults which her body commits, and though she gives it life and motion, she hath not liberty enough to give it the guidance thereof. Imagination is the sole faculty which doth in-animate it, and this confused faculty not being guided by reason, commits evil unpunished, and pleads blindnesse for the ex|cuse of it's errour.</P>
<P>Yet is it certain that in the condition wherein we are, sleep is a punishment of sin, and had man never sinned, he had never proved those disquiets wherewith he is agitated during his rest; Nature would have born a respect to her Sovereigns sleep, the elements which formed his body would not have troubled his rest, and va|pours would have been so mild, as stupefying all the senses, they would have left the soul at liberty. In this happy condition, man might well have refreshed himself by sleep, <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Ego dormio &amp; cor meum vigilat. Adae s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">mnus ex|tasis appellatur &agrave; Patribus.</NOTE> his eyes would have been closed against the light, and his other senses would have dis|pensed with their ordinary functions.

<P>I have much ado to believe that man was reduced to the conditi|on of beasts, before he had sinned, and that he should have under|gone the punishment of an offence, which he had not as yet commit|ted. If there have been some Saints whom sleep did not deprive of the use of reason, and who loved God even whilst they slept, I think it not strange that the heavens should have granted this favour to our first father in his innocency, &amp; that he entertein'd himself with Angels, whilest he could not entertain himself with men.

The better part of Divines do not question but that the Virgin did enjoy this priviledge all her life, and that her soul, whilest her body rested, was wholly busied in considering the wonders of her son, she loved him as well sleeping, as waking; Sleep did not interrupt her love: Sleep which makes us beasts, made her an Angel, and her soul had this advantage in the night season that it did act without any dependency upon her bodie; rest did not be|reave her of half her life, as it doth us, were she asleep, or were she awake, she did equally apply her self to God, her sleep was more ope|rative then all our watchings, when her mouth was shut, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Somnus licen|tia animae sine more fugitivae. <HI>Tertul.</HI></NOTE> her spi|rit supplied her silence, and she praised God with her heart, not being able to do it with her tongue.</P>

<P>This punishment seems to be more injurious than death, whose image it is: for death loosens the soule from the body, raiseth her to the condition of Angels, and withdraws her from a prison, which though she delighted in, ceased not to be fatall to her: but sleep stupifies the senses, sets upon such parts of the body as the soule makes most claim to; disperseth it's vapours into the eyes and ears, and reduceth man into a condition wherein he can neither speak, nor think. The heart during sleep, is in a perpetuall motion; natu|rall heat disgests meat, the liver converts it into bloud, and distri|butes it abroad amongst the veines; every part turnes it into it's own substance, and by a continuall miracle one and the same nourish|ment doth extend it selfe into nerves, thickens into flesh, and har|dens into bone.

<P>That we must fear what we desire, and desire what we feare.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_T'Is with much reason that originall sin is by Saint <HI>Austine</HI> tearmed the universall corruption of nature, since there is no|thing left in man, uncorrupted; his un|derstanding is so clouded with darknesse as he cannot discern truth from falshood, his memory is so weakened, as it is pain|full for him to learn, and naturall to for|get; his will is depraved as it loves no|thing but what is pleasing to the senses. His very aids are pernitious, and the succour which nature hath af|forded him for his help in his necessity, serves onely to make him the more miserable.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="143">
Being stript of all the good which he possest in the State of in|nocency, it seems he needs desires, and that this passion is requisite to him, to finde out helps for his indigency; being condemned to undergo those punishments which his rebellion deserved, feare seems to be necessary to him, and that to shun the evils which threaten him; Divine mercy had ought to have made him fearfull; yet this assistance is prejudiciall to him, these remedies do augment his evill, and he would be lesse unhappy, if he could keep himselfe from wishing for good, or fearing evill. <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Non est in carendo difficul|tas nisi cum fuerit in ha|bendo cupiditas <HI>Aug. Confess.</HI></NOTE> For to boot that desire is but a languishing of the soule which is occasioned oftner by her weaknesse, than by her want; and which reaches rather to things superfluous, than necessary; 'tis very well known, that it harms a man, whil'st it would heal him; that it widens his wounds, in stead of closing them; and that it increaseth his necessities, in lieu of comforting them: <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Quidquid il|l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">gerat non finis erit cupi|ditatis, sed gradus. <HI>Senec.</HI></NOTE> one desire causeth another, and man imagin|ing that the greatest good will cost him but wishes; forgoes all o|ther exercise to consume himselfe in unprofitable desires: he doth not relish the good which he enjoyeth, he despiseth that which he sought after, and as if things were the more precious for being ei|ther absent, or lost, he esteems none but what he hath either lost, or hath not yet gotten: all things seem pleasing to him which he hath not, evils do to him change their nature; when they are far off, and be it either that his capacity cannot reach them, or that his desire paints them forth unto him in glorious colours, he oft-times wisheth his harm; <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Attonitus novitate mali, div<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">sque miser|que e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">gere ap|tat opes: &amp; quas modo vo|ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">at odit. <HI>O|vid.

<P>It's promises are as pernicious as are it's advices, for it seldome makes good any thing that it promiseth, it glories in abusing those that believe in it; and hope which serves it for a surety, abuseth our easinesse, in engaging us to seek after a good which is difficult, and dangerous: she perswades those who listen unto her, that she is a fore-runner of felicity, that a thing desired, is halfe possessed; and to have an extream passion for riches or honour, is to quit in|famy, and poverty. But it falls out clean contrary, for desire adds to indig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">y, it irritates the evill which it would allay, and makes the ambitious, infamous, and avaritious needy.

Those who suffer dishonour without desire of glory, are troubled but with one malady; but those who adde to the pain of being despised, the passion of glory, endure a double Martyrdome. Thus the desire of good, is the increase of evill, and he who makes many wishes, exposeth himselfe to most sufferings. Heaven punisheth the guilty, by giving them over to their own desires; this passion is more severe than the rack; and who could hand|somly handle it to punish the ambitious or amorous, he might stay all other punishments. Nothing doth so much torment the dam|ned as their desires; if they could live without wishes as well as without hope, their sufferings would be lesse severe, and hell would have lost her sorest torment.</P>
<P>The holy Scripture teacheth us, that God makes use of our de|sires, as Ministers of his vengeance; and that the losse of our goods and death of friends are but the punishments of our lightest offences. When the City of <HI>Ierusalem</HI> was taken by force in the reign of <HI>Antiochus,</HI> in so much as the Temple was prophaned, the Al|tars beaten down, that the fire consumed what the sword had spa|red; that rivers of bloud ran in the publique places, and that wo|men were robbed of their honour, and their husbands of their li|berty; the writer of this story tells us, that so tragicall a disaster was but the preamble to Gods Justice; <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Propter pec|cata habitan|tium civitatem modicum Deu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">uerat iratus. 2 <HI>Machab.</HI> 5.</NOTE> and (if a man may be allowed to say so) but the pastime of his anger: if he had been more incensed, he would have found out severer punishments, but because his indignation was but small, he was satisfied with the ruine of the Temple, and <HI>Ierusalems</HI> pillage: but when his just fury is at the height, and that the number of our insolent sins doth provoke his choller, he gives us over to our own desires, and com|mand these executioners of his Justice, to make us try all the ri|gour which love can make the unchaste suffer, or pride the ambiti|ous; he somtimes permits these unjust desires to take effect, he grants what we desire, to make us the more unfortunate, and the more guilty; <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Plera&abque; gaudi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> Iustiti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> ev|&agrave; Deo non su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t gaudia &amp; sepe initiasunt fu|tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">. <HI>Sen.

<P>Since the losse of innocency, greatnesse is fatall to man, and he cannot be raised up, without hazard of being undone: he is so prodigiously out of order, as the punishments of his sin are more advantageous to him, than the remainders of originall righteous|nesse.

Watsoever is glorious is fatall to him; <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Diuturnis honorib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> dete|riores fiunt ho|mines, &amp; ferre secundam for|tunam non om|nes possunt. <HI>A|ristot. lib. 5. de Republ. cap.</HI> 8.</NOTE> dignities increase his haughtinesse, and makes him for|get his misery; they raise him up onely to throw him headlong down; and 'tis a kind of miracle if hee continue humble in greatnesse. <HI>Lucifer,</HI> who had not our weaknesses, could not re|sist this dangerous enemy; the place he held amongst the An|gels, made him vain glorious, his glory dashed his understand|ing, and seeing all creatures were submitted unto him, he could not endure to submit himselfe to his Creatour; his crime pro|ceeded from his excellency, he was onely proud, because he was raised to too high a degree; and if the pain he suffers could truth from out his mouth, he would confesse he is onely miserable for having been too happy. Man lost himselfe by the same dis|order; the terrestiall Paradise made him forget that the earth was the place of his birth, and the matter whereof his body was composed; the association of Angels, and obedience of beasts, made him believe he was independent; and held of no body. And seeing whole nature busied either for his pleasure, or for his service, he thought that if he were not a God, he might at least become one. But not to speak more of those past dis|asters, he is overwhelmed with the weight of greatnesse; there are but few hands which can bear a Scepter without vanity, and but few heads which do not bow under the weight of a Crown.

Tis much more hard to make use of pleasure than to make use of pain, and more Philosophers are found to have been patient in af|flictions, then moderate in pleasures, riches cause more disorder than poverty; and were not men over-rul'd by opinion, want would be more sufferable than aboundance. Though we be not stoicks, and though the fond imaginations of the haughty Philosophers did as|wel give against reason as truth, we forbear not to confesse with them, that sorrow is to be preferred before joy, and that it is better for a man to suffer pain, then to tast pleasure. <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Imitatrix bo|ni voluptas est, malorum mat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">r omnium cujus blanditiis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">or|rumpuntur quae natur&aacute; bona sunt. <HI>Cic. de legibus.</HI></NOTE> All his advantages are pernitious to him, the remainders of innocency ingage him in sin, and he cannot follow <HI>Adams</HI> tract, without falling into his preci|pice: thus ought he to suspect all his desires, and all his hopes, the good whlch flatters him, deceives him; what pleaseth him, is fatall to him; and to expresse in a word, the irregularity which sin hath placed in his nature, we must affirm, that he is bound to fear what he hopes, and to hope what he fears.</P>
<P>For fear abuseth us aswell as hope, and she is unjust, and unfaith|full when she paints forth evill to us like a Monster, it may suffice us to suffer it when it hath happened, without anticipating it by our ap|prehension. That wisedome which foresees an evil, and cannot di|vert it, serves but to hasten it; and a man had better be surprized by a disaster, then fear it long: this is not withstanding the usuall effect of fear; she fore-runs our misfortunes, under pretence of freeing us from them; she indiscreetly engageth us in them; and through a vain desire of making us more happy, she oft-times makes us more miserable; 'tis thought that she makes up a part of our wisedome, that she fore-sees not an evil save onely to prevent it; that unlesse it were for fear of poverty, we should not heap up riches, that 'tis fear of war, which makes us raise strong holds, and that if it were not for fear of famine, we should not cultirate the ground.</P>

<P>Yet this kind of punishment is usefull to Christians. They are sooner saved by sufferings than by pleasures, they must change their feeling as well as their condition, and remembring that they are fal|len from the happy state of innocency, they must no longer pretend to their past felicity, neither yet complain of their present misery.

<P>THose who will praise honour, and perswade us that she, is the reward of vertue, say with <HI>Aristotle,</HI> that generous min|ded men prefer her before life, and those that bereave us of her are more injurious to us, and more unjust, than those who be|reave us of our riches.

<P>But this argumentation is as seeble as false, for honour hath lost her purity, since man hath lost his innocency: she is dealt about more unjustly then riches, ti's a good which depends onely upon opinion, which is as soon gotten by vice as by vertue; and which subsists more by good fortune, than by justice.

<P>This unjust vanity is crept even into religion: we oft-times judge of Saints greatnesse, by the eminency of their births, we read the life of a Prince with more admiration then that of a Peasant, and be it either that vertue be rarer in Courts than in cottages, or that we be rather born away with appearances than truths, a common action in the person of a Prince seems noble to us. All things appear great un|derneath a Crown: and we are so accustomed to flatter Princes, as they passe for good if they be not bad. Eloquence labours to disguise their faults, she gives honourable names to shamefull actions: and she thinks that Traffick is not base there, where she barters smoak and wind for Gold.

<P>Great faults are the noblest vertues; Princes who shed most bloud, receive most honour; robbery and murther are the steps whereby Tyrants get into Kings Thrones; people put not so great a valuation upon those who have defended them, as on those who have conquered them; and all things in the world are so out of order, as usurpation in Monarches is more glorious than succes|sion. The one is the work of Nature, the other of Fortune; they owe their election to their subjects love, and are bound for their conquests to their souldiers valour. Triumph, which was vertues highest recompence amongst the <HI>Romans,</HI> was granted onely to such as had committed most murthers, and sackt most Towns; renown was not to be purchased in that Commonwealth, but by violence and injustice. That which their <HI>Historians</HI> calls victories, their enemies terme butchery; what served for a sport to the <HI>Ro|mane</HI> Dames, made the widowes of <HI>Carthage</HI> weep; and the same successe which made them be reverenced, made them be hated by their enemies. Thus triumph, is onely founded upon faults, com|bates are not made without weapons, nor are victories wonne with|out murther.</P>

To say truth, man takes no longer pleasure in any thing save in criminall delights, the inclination which he hath for the <HI>Summum Bonum,</HI> serves onely to keep the further from it; and for not taking his aim aright, he strays from his end whilest he thinks to draw neer it: the love which he bears to knowledge is but a meer curiosity, he loves truth like a whore, not like a legitimate wife, he seeks her out onely to passe away his time, as oft as she blames his disorders, he turns his love into ha|tred, and becomes her persecutor whose servant he was.</P>
<P>His passion for Sovereignty, is not more lawfull, though he de|sire a Good which he hath possessed, 'tis upon such conditions, as make his desire unjust. He wisheth for an independant Crown, whith may hold of no body, he will be absolute in his estate, and since he is become the Devils slave, he will be no longer Gods sub|ject: his ambition will not suffer him to acknowledge his legitimate Sovereign, and his basenesse forceth him to tolerate a Tyrant; he would think he should injure his liberty, should he assubject it to the will <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Quid facies daemones colen|do nisi ut offen|das illum quo offenso in illo|rum potestatem daberis? &amp; qui nihil tihi possent facere illo pla|cato, facient quidquid vol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t illo irato. <HI>Aug. in Psal.</HI> 25.</NOTE> of his Creator, and thinks not that he wrongs his nobility, when he submits himself to an usurper: he feeds himself with vain authority, and false greatnesse; he thinks himself not forced, because he follows his own inclinations, and because his Master keeps him tied up with Chains of Gold, he cannot think he is a slave. This er|rour slides the easilyer into the souls of Kings, for that seeing so ma|ny subjects obey them, they cannot perswade themselves that ser|vitude can meet with so many marks of liberty.

which they finde in their Dominions, makes them believe they are absolute: the blinde respect which is rendred to their de|gree, makes them forget the miseries of their birth: flattery insi|nuates her selfe easily into them, unlesse they be armed with reason, to withstand her, and these pleasing falshoods banish away truth. In so high a pitch of fortune, where nothing is wanting to compleat the felicity of their senses; their soule is weakned, and being char|med by false praises, they believe what they desire. They imagine that death dares not assaile a Monarch which the world stands in awe of, and whom fortune reverenceth: They make a God-head of their greatnesse; they despise such honours as are not divine; and though sicknesses which advertise them of their weaknesse, assure them of their deaths; they hope for an un-exampled miracle, and perswade themselves that immortality is a favour wherewith heaven will honour their merit: The guards which watch about their Palaces, might easily cure them of this errour; did not flat|tery which makes them as stupid, as insolent, bereave them both of their judgement, and modesty: the conspiracies which are made a|gainst their persons, the parties which are packt in their Territories, the cunning which is used to corrupt their subjects loyalty, are rea|sons good enough to abate their pride; and to destroy that foolish confidence which feeds their vanity. <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Magna fortu|na magna ser|vitus. <HI>Senec.</HI></NOTE> But without going so far for remedies for their evils, their onely greatnesse is able to cure them; when if they would consider the condition whereinto sin hath reduced Monarchs, they would confesse that the power which waites upon them is but weak, and dangerous, full of anxiety, and mixt with servitude.</P>
<P>Though God will suffer us to share with him in his perfections, though he permit that our vertues be a shadow of his divine attri|butes, that our condition be such as we may imitate them; and though a man be not rationall unlesse he endeavour to expresse in his soule an image of divinity, yet amongst that number of perfecti|ons which we adore in God, some seem to be advantagious to us, other some prejudiciall. It is lawfull for all men to aspire to ho|linesse, and let us give what ever reins we please to this passion, it can never be criminall.

<P>But there are some other attributes in God which one nor can, nor ought to imitate, save with an humble reservednesse; it is dan|gerous to wish for knowledge; and as our first father lost himselfe onely out of a desire of being too knowing, the desire thereof is oft-times sinfull, and the seeking after it always dangerous. Beauty is one of the excellentest perfections which religion acknowledg|eth in God, 'tis the chiefe object of our beatitude; and were not God as beautifull as he is good, he would not be the desire, and the happinesse of all rationall creatures: <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Dignitas for|mae gravior possidentibus, &amp; appetentibus exitiosa, exposi|ta tentationibus, &amp; circumdata scandalis. <HI>Tert.</HI></NOTE> yet we cannot seek after the possession of this advantage without danger; in women pride accompanies beauty; chastity and she, are not upon good tearms, and 'tis a kinde of prodigy, when a woman is as chaste, as fair. Greatnesse and power are two of Gods Attributes, which merit e|quall honour, each of them inspires fear into the soule of the crea|ture; if they be ravisht with his goodnesse, his Majesty astonisheth them; and if his beauty oblige them to love him, his power en|forceth them to reverence him. Thus dividing themselves between respect and love, they love him as their Father, and adore him as their Sovereign: <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Iustitia ex|hibet Deum Pa|trem &amp; Domi|num: Patrem potestate blan|da, Dominum severa, Patrem diligendum pi&egrave;, Dominum ti|mendum neces|sario. <HI>Tertul. contra Marc. lib. 2. cap.</HI> 12.</NOTE> yet this perfection which preserves the honour of God amongst men, cannot without danger be wished for; who prescribes not bounds to the desire thereof falls easily into errour; and he who pretends to his greatnesse who hath no equall, cannot avoid his just anger. <HI>Lucifers</HI> undoing was for that he would reign in heaven; if pride was his sin, greatnesse was the object thereof; and if that glorious Angell be now a devill, 'tis because his ambi|tion made him wish himselfe a God.

do; the higher they be raised up by greatnesse, the more are they threatened by vanity; that which draws them neerer God, keeps them the farther from him; and the same Majesty which makes them his images, makes them oft-times his enemies.</P>

The first King of <HI>Israel</HI> was a reprobate, his election which was somewhat miraculous freed him not from sin, neither could the prayers of a Prophet appease Gods anger: his fault at first was but impatience, and in the progresse thereof, but a slight enterprize upon the priestly office. The presence of his enemies whereby he was obliged to fight, might serve him for an excuse, and the laws of war, which will have a man make use of advantages, was a reason of state, which might have sheltred him in the opinion of Polititians. Yet this fault which had so fair an appearance, was punished by the routing of his army, he found death, when he sought for glory; and the same mountain which was the pitcht field wherein he set upon his ene|mies, was the scaffold whereon he was punished by Divine Ju|stice.</P>
<P>Poets who never read our scripture, judged aright, that Crowns were not always set upon the most innocent heads, and that king|doms were oftner the punishment of sin than the reward of vertue. <HI>Iocasta</HI> made use of this reason to divert <HI>Polinices</HI> from the war which he undertook against <HI>Eteocles,</HI> she assured him, that without troubling himself with fighting, he should be sufficiently revenged of a reigning brother, <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Ne metus, poe|nas &amp; quidem solvet grazes, reguabit. <HI>Senec in Thebaid.</HI></NOTE> for that a kingdome was a severe punish|ment, and that of all his ancestors there was not any Sovereign who had not been unfortunate,</P>
<P>Though this Maxime be not always true in Christianity, and that there have been Kings, whose Thrones have served them for steps to mount up to heaven by, 'tis alwaies very dangerous to be raised to a condition which permits them to doe what they please, and with not bereaving them of their passions unrulinesse, affords them means of satisfying them: For in this supream authority, which hath no arbitrator, nor censurer, they can do what they will, their

All women are not couragious enough to expose their lives to save their honour: those who have worth enough to re|sist the vain discourses of men, have not strength sufficient to with|stand a Princes promises, and there are but very few who will not ha|zard their chastity to triumph over the liberty of a Monarch. If they be greedy they will find a thousand pretences to enrich themselves at their subjects costs, and to fill their cofers with the spoyles of Orphans and Widows. If they be cruell they will find fitting Mi|nisters for their fury: glorious names are given unto their faults, all their revenges passe for acts of justice; they are termed the Fathers of the people, when they wash their hands in their subjects bloud; their anger is animated by servile praise, and their cruelty incou|raged by approbation: so as Kings have no greater enemies to their welfare then this uncurbed licentiousnesse which accompanieth their greatnesse, and that absolute power which furnisheth them with means to execute all their designs.</P>
<P>But say they were lesse irregular and grant that reason assisted by Grace should keep them from abusing their Sovereign Authority, they would not be exempt from fears, and dangers. <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Nihil est quod ab Imperator|bus emendari non queat, nec ullum peccatum est quod vires eorum superet, &amp; quidquid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">mittunt, fa cere videntur. <HI>Nicetas.</HI></NOTE> For as they are the heads of their People, they are answerable for their faults, they commit all the evil w^c^h they do not hinder, &amp; those publike disorders wherewith all the world is scandalized, are the particular sins of So|vereigns.

In the state of innocency, the world had had no kings, or kings would have had no trouble, for passion not having yet rebel'd against reason, every one might have gover|ned himself without any danger, and all men might have obeyed without repugnancy: the will of the subject would always have been conformable to that of their King, and Kings would have exacted nothing from their subjects, which should not have been both profi|table and pleasing to them: in this happy season crowns would not have been environed with thorns, and the curse thundred out against the earth, would not have fallen upon the heads of Kings, <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> artium regereanimos hominum. <HI>Greg.</HI></NOTE> there would have been no difficulty in the art of reigning, and the state be|ing an image of man; the one and the other would have found rest in his innocency.

<P>If royalty meet with danger, labour is inseparable from it, and glory is therein so mingled with pain, as government ceaseth to be glorious, when it is easie. Kings command over free men who do not engage themselves in submission, save onely that they hope there to find happinesse: this is a thing which heightens the greatnesse of Monarchs, but it adds unto their cares, and unlesse they will lose the title of kings, and purchase the name of Tyrants, they must govern themselves so wisely, as preserving their authority, they do not in|jure their subjects liberty. <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Solus Nerva duas res olim insotiabiles mis|cuit libertatem, &amp; Imperium. <HI>Tacit.</HI></NOTE> This is a temper so hard to be met with|all, as most Princes are either too indulgent or too severe, some treat their subjects like savage beasts, and seem rather to govern Lyons, than men; others deal with them as with Children, and rather dis|charge the duty of a Pedagogue then of a king, others treat them like slaves, changing their kingdome into a gally, and foregoing the quality of a king to assume that of a Captain of a Gally. Others treat them like rebels, and confounding Monarchy with Tyranny, have no other law than their will, nor other means to make them be obeyed then torments, and punishments, but Legitimate kings deal with them as with free people, interessing themselves in their Good, and studying to win their hearts without intrenching upon their liberties.</P>

It is true that their conditions are as different, as their designs, for some find their own welfare to consist in that of their subjects, and others find their losse in that of their state, the one acquires honour by dispising it, others lose it, by seeking after it, the one establisheth his authority by foregoing it, and the other destroy it whilst they would establish it, but they all learn by experience, that since the sin of <HI>A|dam</HI> there is no liberty without servitude, nor Greatnesse without dependency.</P>

This intestine war caused forreign discords; when man became once divided in his person, divisions a|rose in his state, and at the same time that his soul and body gave o|ver their good intelligence, all his <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Omnis crea|tura pugnavit contra insensa|tos.</NOTE> subjects revolted, every element set upon him to revenge it self, and the conspiracy was so generall, as this unfortunate Sovereign saw not any one part of his state wherein he had not enemies to fight withall, and rebels to sub|due.</P>
<P>Before that Heaven afforded him some means to reduce them to their duties, he suffered unexpressible misery, and to draw an <HI>Idea</HI> of his disaster, we must set forth a man exposed to the rigour of the air, without cloaths; one persecuted by the elements, who had no house, one starved with hunger, who could not cultivate the earth; one fought withall by his passions, who had no vertues to discover them, one composed of disagreeing parts, who had no power to re|reconcile them: such a one was <HI>Adam,</HI> when he was driven out of the earthly Paradise; all his subjects became his enemies, every ele|ment to offend him, grew unruly, the seasons mingled themselves disorderly to punish him; and beasts which were not as then wild, changed their Nature to persecute him.</P>

This permission did notwithstanding inspire cruelty insensi|bly into him; by killing beasts, he learnt to kill men; these his first Trials made him Master of his art, so as passing through all the degrees of injustice, after having committed murther, he commit|ted parricide. For when he saw that the death of one man had drawn upon him the hatred of all those that belonged unto him, he sought for some to side with him, he engaged all his friends in his quarrell: then did men forge weapons to undo themselves; they who had only pursued their subjects, pursued those that were like themselves; And arrows which were only dipt in the bloud of beasts, were stained with mans bloud; the Chieftaines of parties, chose out pitcht fields to end their differences, they encouraged their souldiers to the combate, <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Tunc solum utile est concur|rere ad arma, cum locum a|pud hostem in|venire non po|test justitia. <HI>Cassiodo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">. lib. 3 Epist.</HI> 1</NOTE> they made them hope for the spoil of the enemy, and perswaded them that revenge and murther were glorious actions.</P>
<P>This cruell opinion spread it selfe over the whole world, the trade of war grew honourable, and the name of murtherer was changed into that of souldier; ambition increasing with time, eve|ry one thought that greatnesse consisted in injustice, that he who had committed most murthers, was most couragious; and that he who had overcome most Nations, plundered most Towns, and o|ver-run most Provinces, was the most famous Conquerour.

Though we have as many proofes of the corruption of our na|ture, as we have inclinations in our soule, yet we must confesse there is none more strong then that which an extream desire to wage war, doth furnish us withall: for fury hath perswaded us, that it was the most glorious employment that might be, we hear Conquerors spoken of with respect, we read their fights w^t^h admiration, we tearm their Injustice Heroick actions, Eloquence cannot find out expressi|ons noble enough to honour their Ambition. Historians think them|selves happy when they write a Prince his life who hath drowned the fields with humane bloud, and who like thunder hath born down what ever withstood his violence. We give the title of grand to those who have unpeopled the world, we propound unto our Kings the example of such who have ruined their subjects to over|come their neighbours; we foment their ambition, by the praise we give usurpers: we insensibly perswade them, that Justice is but the vertue of private men: and that Sovereigns who have no law but their will, ought to seek for no other right, or title than Vio|lence.</P>
<P>There is nothing more horrible then war, sin is the cause thereof, and this wicked Father produceth nothing which more resembles him than this Monster. Injustice and ambition are the officers which do guide it, Fury and Cruelty the Serjeants which do accompany it, and it's exployts are plunder, murther, violence, and burning; it car|ries terrour and dread into all parts where it comes, changeth fields into desarts, towns into solitary places, and Kingdomes into Tyran|nies, it mingles childrens tears with their Fathers bloud, bereaves women of their honour, and their husbands of their Liberties, rai|seth it's Trophies upon the ruine of Cities, or upon mounteins of dead men, it grounds it's Triumphs upon the undoing of kingdoms, and draws it's praises from the cries and complaints of Captives.

<P>Those who see the disasters caused by war, imagine the cause there|of ought to be very considerable, and that Princes break not with their neighbours or allies uninforced by powerfull reasons; yet are the motives thereof, oft times ridiculous; what causeth a suite at law between two private men, begets a quarrell between two Prin|ces, what puts a division between two families, puts a difference be|tween two states, and that which is the undoing of two parties who go to law together, doth oft-times ruine two Nations, which wage war together, an apple was the chief cause of the burning of <HI>Troy;</HI> the ravishing of <HI>Helen</HI> was but the occasion; Poets who hide Truths underfables, would have the famousest siege in all the world should be undertaken to revenge the Jealousie of two women; and that the greatest Empire of <HI>Asia,</HI> <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Manet alta mente repostum judicium Pari|dio: spretaeque injuris formae. <HI>Virgil.</HI></NOTE> should be ruined to punish a shep|heards judgment.</P>
<P>Ambition which delights in greatnesse, hath no juster nor no more worthy motions; <HI>Greece</HI> complained no longer of <HI>Persia</HI> when <HI>Alex|ander</HI> set upon her; nothing can make this Conqueror carry fire and and sword into his neighbours country, save a vain desire to reign; and who should have asked him the motive of so unjust and rash a design, must have found it to have been his vain glory. The Com|monwealth of <HI>Rome</HI> was at the height of her prosperity, when <HI>Cas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> resolved to change her into a Monarchy, <HI>Pompeys</HI> greatnesse served him onely for a pretence to execute his enterprize, for though his sonne in laws exploits had caused no Jealousies in him, and that he had not been incouraged to that design, by the examples of <HI>Marius</HI> and <HI>Scilla,</HI> his ambition was of it self sufficient to cause this desire in him: his insolent mind could endure no equals, his citizens if they will be his friends must be his slaves, all whatsoever greatnesse must bow to him, lest they cause his indignation; and the people must receive a shamefull peace, if they will not suffer a direfull war. I am further of opinion, <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">In landibus <HI>Caesaris</HI> posuit <HI>Sallustius</HI> quod sibi magnum im|perium exerci|tum, bellum no|vum exoptabat ubi virtus eni|tescere potest ut miseras ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">es in bellum exci|taret. <HI>Aug. lib. de Civit. c.</HI> 12.</NOTE> that this Monster nurst up in butchery and bloud, would have made enemies, if he had found none; that after having vext the <HI>Romanes,</HI> he would have persecuted the <HI>Parthians,</HI> and that passing from one Country to another, he would have dis|peopled

The wars of our Ance|stours have had no juster pretences; those which our Histories ring most of, have had but weak motives; the jealousie of two Fami|lies have oft-times endangered the Kingdom; two Favourites have oft-times used their Masters Militia, to end their own differences; hundred thousand men have interessed themselves in the fight, not knowing the occasion thereof.</P>
<P>But certainly it must be confest if wars have small causes, they produce strange effects; <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Summum <HI>Bruto</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> ci|vilia bella fate|mur. <HI>Lucan.</HI></NOTE> and that those which we tearm civill, ex|ceed all others in cruelty: for men make profession to violate all the laws of nature, and as if every souldier were of his Generals humour, he believes that his nearest kindred are his greatest ene|mies; he dips his hands in his own bloud to assure his Captain of his fidelity; his ambition makes him lose all sense of humanity; he would think he should betray his duty, if he spared his friends; and esteem himselfe not worthy the name of a souldier, if he could forget the names of father, and mother. He who sacrificed him|selfe upon his brothers body whom he had heedlesly killed in the heat of the battell, was yet but an Apprentice in war; and more expe|rienced than he, would have presented his brothers head unto the Ge|nerall, to have had some recompence for it. Civill Wars stifle all the relations of nature; those who fight in the same Kingdom under differing Ensignes, have nothing of man but the face; they cease to love or know one another, after once they begin to fall a siding; and when the heart of their Countrey is the Theater of their Bat|tels, their cruelty cannot be mitigated by any Alliance.</P>
<P>History, or else Fiction, tells us of two brothers whom their mo|thers tears was never able to reconcile: they fought hand to hand in the head of their Armies, to spare their souldiers bloud; they through their own wounds, poured forth their Fathers bloud: death, which they both received at the same moment, could not appease their quarrell; hatred appeared in their countenances, when it had forsaken their heart; <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Non suriis post fata mo|dum, flammas&abque; rebelles, seditio|ne rogi. <HI>Stat. Thebaid. lib.</HI> 1.</NOTE> their souls descended into hell, to end their combate there; and fury passing from their bodies to their fu|nerall Pile, divided the flames which consumed them. This fiction of the Poets, is a truth amongst Christians; amongst whom there are brothers found whose hatred is immortall, who preserve their animosity after the losse of their lives; who leave it for an inheri|tance
<PB N="276" REF="157">
to their successours; who charge their children to revenge their injuries; and who shewing a face of war in time of peace, do meditate murther when they cannot commit it. I wonder not that the same thoughts which did possesse them in their life, possesse them likewise in their death; and that those who delighted in no|thing but bloud, did dream on nought but cruelties; since an ill ha|bit is an invisible chain which keeps the will captive, and will not suffer it to abhor a crime, which hath alway been pleasing to it. But I cannot well comprehend how sin should so far corrupt man, as to perswade him that murther was honourable, that there was glory in committing it, pleasure in beholding it, and that the cruel|lest action that may be, could purchase glory, or cause content.</P>
<P>All Paganisme took pleasure to see the Gladiators fight; the effusion of mans bloud was one of their most pleasing spectacles; and <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Homo occidi|tur in hominis voluptatem, &amp; ut quis possit perimere usus est.

Sin must needs reign in their hearts, since it had driven thence all sense of humanity; and that making man-slaughter a vertue, it had perswaded them that glory consist|ed in injustice, and pleasure in cruelty: this madnesse, grew in time to so great a height, as to make killing more easie, and the sport more pleasing; men were to fight stark naked with offensive wea|pons, but none defensive. Obscenity was joyned to cruelty, to the end that one might content two passions with one and the same spectacle, and that the sight of a dying wretch might make them love his murtherer; yet these combates are but the shadows of war; the <HI>Gladiators</HI> fury is but the souldiers entrance; Companies were fill'd up which these people nurst up in bloud; and when re|cruits were to be had, those were sought for in the <HI>Arenae,</HI> who had made themselves famous by the death of their Companions. And certainly duels which serve for pastime to our nobility, are neither
<PB N="277" REF="157">
more just, nor yet lesse cruell; so brutish a passion cannot be but in mindes where sin doth Tyrannize: a man must renounce both reason and Grace, to obey so blind a fury; and one must cease to be either rationall or faithfull, if he believe that a Gentlemans Glory consists in Murther; yet this errour is become a custome, Gentlemen love ra|ther to lose their heads upon a scaffold, and dye by the hands of a hangman, then to be failing in an occasion where they know their conscience is in an ill condition, and that they are in danger of lo|sing both soul and body; fear of shame hath more power over them then fear of Hell; they chuse rather to incurre Gods anger, and their Princes, then the peoples reproach, and by a foolish extravagancy, they hazard their soul to preserve their honour.</P>
<P>As this blind Passion differs not much from that which animates Conquerors to war, so doth she likewise proceed from the same principle; the one and the other proceed from sin, which having put us at ods with our selves, puts us likewise at ods with our neigh|bours; and perswades us that all means are lawfull whereby we may acquire honour.

<P>That Riches render men poor and sinfull.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THough it be hard to say, which is the severest punishment man hath suffered since his losse of innocency, and that ser|vitude, and death are pains equally insupportable to those who love their liberty as their life, yet me thinks there is a third more rigorous, which all men do resent, yet not any one complains off. And this is nothing else but the calling to mind the possession of all those good things which we have lost together with our innocen|cy: a desire of them remains in us, which vertues self cannot efface, we sigh when we want them, and we never are so sensible of our misery, as when we are assailed by pain, infamy or poverty. <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Multis paras|se divitias non finis miseria|rum suit sed mutati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">. Non hoc miror non est enim in rebus vitium sed in ipso animo. Illud quod pauperta|tem gravem se|cerot &amp; divi|tias graves fe|cit. <HI>Senec. Epist. 17.</HI></NOTE> Yet are their remedies new diseases, and we never do so well know our own weaknesse, as when we abound in pleasures, honours, and rich|es.</P>
<P>This is so true a Maxime as that all Christian Religion makes profession, of either really foregoing all those advantages which men enjoyed during the state of innocency, or else of desiring to do so. She rejects honour, and seeks out shame, she shuns delight, and nourisheth her self in sorrow, she forsakes riches, and embraceth po|verty. Being instructed in the school of Mount <HI>Calvary,</HI> she turns the punishments of her sin into remedies, she makes vertues of her chastizements and shuns those advantages which man possessed in paradise, least following <HI>Adams</HI> example, she might fall upon his disaster. To say truth, all our pleasures are irregular, we cannot la|bour after honour, without hazarding our humility, and we can|not

possesse riches without becomming insolent, the malady rests not onely in our desires; it is past into these objects, which give it birth, and there is a certain malignity found in the use of Riches which makes us lose our innocency: <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Speciosa sup|plicia. <HI>Cyprian.</HI></NOTE> they are specious tor|ments, and pleasing punishments, which promise us to allay an evill, which they do irritate. Poverty stands in need of something, but avarice, <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Desunt inopiae multa, avaritiae omnia. <HI>Senec.</HI></NOTE> which is almost inseparable from Riches, needs all things, she wonders that the enemy which she shuns, never fore-goes her, that Poverty should pursue her amidst abundance, and that gold which she adores should fill her cofers, yet not her heart. This metall not being to be divided without diminution, it kindles war amongst men, makes them severally minded, divides their wils, and causeth all those differences which justice endevours to decide. In the state of innocency, men possest all things in common, avarice had not as yet found out bounders to sever fields: Kings had not yet drawn lines to divide the sea: as Light is an universall good, so was the earth a common heritage, and this charitable mother was fruit|full enough to nourish all her children. The poorest man that was, was a King of the whole world. Ambition had not yet form'd states, nor built strong holds upon their Frontiers, all things were possest in common, without any jealousie; self-love had not as yet perswaded any one, that to be master of a thing, all other men must be deprived of it. There was no such thing known as propriety, eve|ry one was content with the riches of nature, and the earth forestal|ling mens desire by her happy faecundity, men did with pleasure ga|ther in her fruits without taking pains to husband her, a man would have thought he should have been become poor, if he had heaped up riches; and he who would have thought that by appropriating any grounds <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o himself, he should have renounced the worlds Sove|reignty: as men do not divide the air, nor the light, so neither did they then divide the sea, nor land; and the seasons not being irregu|lar, the whole world was but a stately palace whereof the heavens were the sieling, and the earth the floor. Meadows served for gar|dens, rivers for channels, forrests were unwalled parks, and the open fields furnisht endlesse walks, large lakes served for fish-pools, and all mens delights were innocent, because purely naturall.</P>
<P>Art had not as yet corrupted Nature, under colour of imbellish|ing her, every thing held that place in the world, which it deser|ved;

Stuffs were unknown, because uselesse; colours appeared not in Lustre, save in pinks and roses; and necessity (which is not the mother of invention, but as it is the daughter of sin) had not obliged man to seek for remedies for miseries, which he did not as yet suffer: but as soon as he would be rich, he became poor; as soon as he heaped together imaginary goods, he lost such as were reall; and when he tilled the ground to make it more fruitfull, the earth punished his avarice by a universall sterility: she who together with fruites, bore flowers, bears now no roses without prickles: the spring which min|gled her beauties with Autumns fertility was divided from thence by summers scorching heat, and winters benumming cold. These two vexatious seasons did disaray the trees, and had not the Angels taught sinfull man, how to sow the ground with seed, famine had prevented the deluge.</P>
<P>When he saw the world changed into a hideous sollitude, he was forced to build houses to fence himselfe against the fury of the Ele|ment; he was on all sides so prest upon by poverty, as he was ne|cessitated to seek out riches; barrennesse which threatned him with famine, made him till the ground; and the fear lest his neigh|bours might reap the fruit of his labours, constrained him to make inclosures: he invented money to entertain commerce with strang|ers; and seeking out a metall, the rarity whereof put a valuation upon it; he found out gold, which nature had hid within her bow|els; he thought she had lodged it next her heart, witnesse the love she bare unto it; the pain he had to draw it thence added to his e|steem thereof; and being dazled by it's colour, and charmed by the advantage he made thereby, he made thereof his first Idoll. The <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Aurum sic Iudaicum po|pulum suo cap|tivavit aspectu ut hoc esse Deum crederent: Au+rum cum mores hominum per|dit, perdit &amp; naturam. <HI>Chry|solog.

They perswaded themselves, that gold was the God which had

delivered them; they were blinded by it's beauty; and though <HI>Aaron</HI> the High Priest had made it into the shape of a Calf, to make it appear the more ridiculous, it's being made of that mettall, was sufficient to make them worship it. Iron by divine providence had it's birth together with gold; for God knowing that murther could not be severed from avarice, he coupled these two mettals to|gether, to the end that the one might be the price of our fraud, and the other the instrument of our fury.</P>
<P>Adultery followed murther; and chastity which had defended her selfe against what man could say to undermine her, could not defend her selfe against riches. Presents prevailed more than hum|ble submissions, and this fraile sex, which affords so many advanta|ges against it selfe, shew'd it selfe to be more avaritious, than proud. In fine, Poets were not much out of the way when they feigned that all evils had their birth together with riches, and that man be|came sinfull, as soon as he grew rich; <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Vivitur ex rapto non hospes ab hospite tu|tus: Imminet exitio vir con|jugis, illa mari|ti, filius ante diem patrios in|quirit in annos, victa jacet pie|tas. <HI>Ovid.

Justice was busied about nothing else but in composing quarrels oc|casioned by this mettall, Gallouses were erected to punish murthe|rers, and men knew that gold which he had found out to supply his necessities, was the cause of all his disasters.</P>
<P>But say that gold should not set men together by the ears, and that peace should not be troubled with the insatiable desire of riches, yet would it be always prejudiciall to a sinner, and he must wish to be poor, if he would recover his innocency. For all his desires are out of order, all his wishes unjust, and sin which doth possesse him, engageth him continually in pernitious designes, he owes all his innocency to his weaknesse, and if he do not perpetrate all the evill which he projects 'tis because Nature hath disabled him. But riches deprive him of this advantage by affording him means to do what he desires, and make a guilty man absolute, by bereaving him of the happy disability whereinto poverty had brought him. <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Inflant ani|mos divitiae, superbiam pari|unt, invidiam contrabunt, &amp; eo us&abque; mentem alienant ut fa|ma pecuniae e|tiam nocitur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> nos delectet. <HI>Sen.

Thus is gold the instrument of all evill, it attempts chastity, cor|rupts justice, sets upon innocency, and oppresseth poverty. When heaven is offended with a sinner, it needs but onely make him rich, to undo him; and make him wealthie to make him wretched; 'tis equivalent to putting a good sword into a mad mans hands, to the preserving of poyson in a christall glasse to one that is frantick, and to the setting of a blind man upon the top of a precipice tapistred with Jessemine and Lillies.</P>
<P>On the contrary, poverty is the sanctuary of innocency, there are fewer faults where lesse of abundance. Those who live by hunting and by fishing know not how to mingle poyson with their drink, if they kill their enemies, 'tis with arrows; and all their combats have lesse of art, and more of generosity in them, then ours have: luxury governs not amongst men who go naked; those families are not ruined with making stately structures, who can shelter themselves under trees, excesse in eating causeth no disasters in those who eat no|thing but the fruits of the earth; and the steem of wine bereaves not them of reason, who drink nothing but spring water.

<P>Aboundance is always accompanied with contempt, if gold were more common, 'twould be despised, that which grows in our cli|mate, must passe into another to purchase reputation; and as there are some fruits which are not good till transplanted, so are there a thou|sand things in the world, which are not prized till after they have changed their countrey. <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Apud barba|ros quosdam quia ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">acu|lum est aurum &amp; copi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">sum, au|ro vinctos in er|gastulis habent, &amp; divit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> malos <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">trant, tanto locupletiores) quanto nocenti|ores.

By all this discourse 'tis easily gathered, that riches are evils which though they be plea|sing, cease not to be dangerous, that man is too much out of order to make good use thereof, that they are serviceable but to one ver|tue, yet of use to all sins. Christians dispose of them by the way of alms, and Philosophers by way of liberality. But in the one and the other of them, avarice doth unjustly accumulate them, prodigality doth profusely dissipate them, pride makes use of them, to heighten her self, vain glory to adorn her self, and choller for revenge, they are onely usefull when they are given away with delight, and lost without sorrow. <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Negotiatio est a liquid amitte|re, ut majora lucreris. <HI>Ter|tul. ad martyr.</HI></NOTE> Their losse is a kind of traffick, he is wise who can acquit himself of them, and he is happy who can live without them.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>That since the losse of innocency Poverty is glorious.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>The two loves that establish those two <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Duas civita|tes fecerunt duo amores: Hieru|salem facit amor Dei, Babyloniam amor saeculi. Interroget igi|tur se unusquis|que quid amet &amp; inveniet ubi fit civis. <HI>Aug. in Psal.</HI> 64.</NOTE> cities, the one of which had Jesus Christ for it's King, the other, the Devil for it's Tyrant, could never be reconciled together, their designs are as opposite, as their inclinations; and though they oft|times march by the same track, they always tend to rather contrary, then differing ends. This truth appears by the use which they make of the miseries of corrupted nature, for self-love extracts sins from thence, divine love vertues; the one augments our evils whilest she would diminish them, the other diminisheth them, whilst she would augment them. From the scorn whereinto we are fallen since our re|belllion, self-love hath formed a design of raising her self up; and (giving against Gods Justice) of finding her greatnesse in her abase|ment, Divine love hath extracted humility from thence, and with an innocent piece of cunning, she leads us to glory by contempt. Self-loue raiseth despair from death, which is sins chiefest punish|ment; and divine love raiseth from thence a sacrifice, which expi|ats our offences, and gives honour to Gods justice from the crea|tures revolt, which doth revenge our outrages done to heaven: self-love argues riot in apparel, magnificence in buildings, and all those other means which we have invented to defend our selves from the injuries of seasons, and divine love, which always prefers the glo|ry of heaven before her own interest, argues repentance from thence, which teacheth us to undergo this persecution with humility. In fine, from the losse of our welfare self-loue hath made avarice arise, which justling Gods designs, undertakes to make man richer in his state of sin, then ever he was in that of innocency, and divine love, which takes pleasure in saving of a sinner by losing him, raiseth po|verty from thence, depriving her self even of those things which her judge would not take from his enemies, that she may appease him. For <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Paupertatem|que serenda effe|cere levem nec iniqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> mente serendam. <HI>Ovid</HI></NOTE> it is true, that this vertue takes it's originall from onr punish|ment,
<PB N="285" REF="162">
'tis a remedy which we have got by our evil; and 'tis a cor|rection which we endure to allay Gods anger.</P>
<P>Whilest man was innocent, he was rich; the sun by his heat made the earth fruitfull, he cherished it, without scorching; and his influences were so well tempered, as trees were always covered with fruit, leaves, and flowers; the fields were fertile without labour, every country bore every thing; and without crossing the seas, that was found in any one part of the world, which all the rest pro|duced. Beasts which afforded nourishment for men yeilded milk in aboundance, running waters were never dried up; and provision was uselesse where there was perpetuall plenty. Bees wrought without wearing themselves, they made their hives at all times, and the earth being continually covered with flowers, there was no season wherein they did not make honey and wax. Man being clothed with innocency, he stript not beasts of their skins to cloth himself, the art of spinning was not as then found out, or if it were known to worms: man did not molest their labours; he admired the industry of their workmanship, the magnificency of their Tombs, and lea|ving them to reassume life where they had left it, he delighted to see them after having been dead arise again.</P>
<P>The elements not having as yet vowed his undoing, he was not bound to guard himself from their injuries, the seasons were so re|gular, as he neither feared heat nor cold; trees were his shelter from them both, and those which afforded him shade in the day|time, served him for covering in the night. If gold were already ript out of the bowels of the earth, it was rankt amongst such things as are esteemed of more for their beauty, then profit. Man thought himself rich enough without that metall; having all things at his command he needed not to buy them: and art not being as yet come into the succour of Nature, he contented himself with looking up|on what he could not make use of. In this happy condition, most desires were <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Summa-opes, inopia desiderto|rum. <HI>Senec.</HI> Nihil interest an multum ba|be as an nihil concupiscas. <HI>Ident.</HI></NOTE> uselesse, and all those wishes which are occasioned by indigency not having as yet a mother, could not disquiet man. He was rich for he wanted nothing, Nature supplied all his needs, whil'st he slept void of care; the starrs which glittered above his head, did by their influences make the earth fruitfull, and the Rivers running amidst the fields, did by their waters bring plenty every where.</P>

But when man became faulty, he became poor; hee lost all his wealth, in losing the <HI>Summum Bonum,</HI> and that selfe same moment which robb'd him of his innocency, threw him headlong into poverty. The earth grew barren under his feet, her fruitfulnesse brought forth nothing but thornes; her bowels must be ript open ere she yeilded fruit, and she must be threatned with iron in her bosome to make her nourish us. Trees shook off their leaves, when winter had disrobed them, men thought that nature was drawing toward her end, and that the earth ceasing to be his Palace, grew to be his Sepulchre: shame shewing him that he was naked, made him make himselfe clothes of leaves, and cold which made him sensible of his sinfulnesse, forced him to apparell himselfe with skins. From that time forwards, necessity made him ingenious; <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Tantam para|turam materia|rum primum regendo homini qua necess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">as praecessit, dehinc &amp; ornando, qua ambitio succes|sit varias indu|mentorum for|mas promulga|vere. <HI>Tertul. de pallio.</HI></NOTE> he built Cabins to fence himselfe from the heat; he sowed corn, to avoid famine; finding that the earth was not fruitfull save by his labour, he lockt up what he had gathered thence, and to shun poverty, fell upon a|varice. But he found by experience, that the remedy was worse than the disease, and that if poor men wanted many things, the covetous wanted all things.</P>
<P>Grace, which doth not abandon even the sinfull, taught him how to use this his punishment, and to turn hie poverty into an il|lustrious vertue. He began to condemne perishable things, and to wish for things eternall; he endeavoured to forgo earth, that he might raise himselfe up to heaven; he had such happy successe in his designes, as he found plenty in poverty; and confest that that vertue had been more advantagious to him then innocency. To say truth; this pain was glorious when it became voluntary; and from once that man began to suffer indigency with humility, he found that God was his Father, Heaven his inheritance, Jesus Christ his Redeemer, and that the holiest blessings were his recompences. For <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Pater paupe|rum Deus pas|sim in Scriptu|ris appellatur.</NOTE> God takes the poor into his protection, he who draws his ra|rest qualities from his noblest works, and who makes himselfe be called the God of heaven and earth, would be called the Father of the poor; a man cannot set upon them, without hurting him, their interests are joyned to his glory, and whosoever makes war upon them, doth infallibly provoke his anger.

Shep|herds had notice of his birth before Kings, and the instruction of the poor was as well a proofe of his mission, as the healing of the sick, or raising of the dead.</P>

Kings are the hands thereof, Prelates the eyes, the people the feet; but the poor are the bowels of it, they are quartered next his heart; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>i</HI> Esurivi &amp; non dedistis mihi manducare; siti|vi, &amp; non dedi|stis mih ibibere. <HI>Luc.</HI></NOTE> &amp; when he shall descend from heaven, to revenge injuries done unto himselfe, and to punish our offences, he will begin with them who shall have neglected him in the poor: the highest favours on earth are reserved for them.

to poverty, nature violated her laws, to obey the words of the poor; and the heavens will was, that he who could give no alms, should do miracles.</P>
<P>In fine, Paradise is the poors inheritance, and after having com|manded upon earth, they shall reign with Jesus Christ, in glory. That which is promised to other vertues, is performed to poverty; in the acknowledgement of merit, and the distribution of Crowns, the poor are dealt withall as advantagiously as are Martyrs; <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Quid sibi vult quod <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">adem promissio facta est pauperibus &amp; Martyribus nisi quia vere <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">artyrii genus est paupertas voluntaria. <HI>Bern.

To say truth, if men do miracles, when they overcome pain, when they tire their Torturers, when they triumph over Tyrants, and vanquish the Elements, and wild beasts, do not they do wonders when they preserve poverty, amidst riches? sobriety amongst Festivals? when they go naked, amidst the pomp of apparell? when they are humble amidst ho|nours? and when they persevere to refuse the Goods which the devill promiseth them, which the world offers them, and which the flesh propounds unto them? ought not they to be crowned, who overcome the world with all it's promises, who contemne the devill with all his illusions, and who tame the flesh with the con|cupiscence thereof?</P>
<P>But in the advantages of poverty, we ought to observe the un|rulinesse of our nature, which is reduced into such a condition, as she cannot without danger make use of what she hath of good: she cannot without injustice pretend to her ancient riches, neither can she acquire new wealth without avarice; we must look upon the things of this world without desiring them, we must live upon the earth, as in a place of exile, and to be happy and innocent, <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Si vis vaca|re animo aut pauper fit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">, aut pauperi <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">lis. <HI>Senec.

To free a mans selfe from these misfortunes, he must grow familiar with poverty, he must sweeten his pain by suffering it patiently, and look upon all the things of the world, as upon

goods which we had lost before were born. We are ruined in the person of our first father; our defeat as well as our default preceded our use of reason, and the same fault which took from us our inno|cency, bereft us of our riches. If we make use of the blessings of the earth, 'tis out of mercy: if the Sun light us, the earth support us, and the fruits thereof do nourish us, 'tis an obligation which we owe unto our God: when once he pronounced the decree of our death, our goods were confiscated to him; the power of making use of them, is a priviledge which we hold of his goodnesse, and he deals with us, as we do with those malefactors which we suffer to live in prison, after their sentence of death is past: if they dispose of their goods, 'tis by their Prince his favour; and if they leave them to their children, 'tis by his permission.

<HEAD>The seventh Discourse.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>That Apparell is a mark of sin</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IF whole man be but meer vanity, if Nature be out of order by his disobedience, if his soul, which hath the honour to be the i|mage of God, and which boasts of her innocency, ceaseth not to find death in his sin; if the will which joyned with Grace is the be|ginning of merit, be more inclined to vice then vertue; if his under|standing which enlightens all the faculties of the soul, be more ca|pable of errour then of truth; if all his knowledge be but meer ig|norance; if his most perspicuous vertues want not their faults; and if his body be his souls prison, we must not wonder that the necessi|ty of apparel be a punishment of his fault, as well as riot therein is a mark of his vain glory. But as it often fals out, that we are most ta|ken with things of least consideration, we find by experience, that there are women in the world, who would rather have their souls sullied, then their cloths; <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Nullarum foeminarum fer&egrave; pretiofior cultus quam quarum pudor vilis est. <HI>Cyprian. de ha|bit. virgin.</HI></NOTE> who would rather have the state be out of order, then their head attire; and who would be lesse troubled to see their honour steined, then their gown. To disabuse these weak women, they must be made know, that luxury in apparell deserves to be despised by men, and to be punished by God.</P>
<P>Cloaths have two uses, which are equally lawfull, the first is to cover our nakednesse, and to hide our body, which began to be shamefull when it ceased to be innocent, <HI>Adam</HI> could not endure himself when he had lost originall righteousnesse, and the shame which infused upon his sin, made him seek out leaves to hide that from his eyes which did displease his soul, he was afraid of himself, when he saw his body did no longer obey reason: he was afraid to offend nature by his nakednesse, not having as yet seen any other monster then himself, he withdrew himself into a wood, and not being able to shun himself, he endevoured to cover himself. <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Fecit quoque Dominus Deus <HI>Adae</HI> &amp; uxori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> ejus tunicas pel|liceas, &amp; induit eos. <HI>Genes.</HI> 3.</NOTE> God himself, who was indulgent to him in his sin, cut out his first sute, and to free him from shame, which was not his least severe punish|ment, he clothed him with the skin of beasts.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="166">
The second use of Apparell is to shelter us from the injury of seasons, <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Tegendo ho|mini necessitas praecessit, dehinc ornando ambi|tio successit. <HI>Tertul. de pal|lio. cap.</HI> 4.</NOTE> and to free our bodies from the rigour of the Elements; for man had no sooner violated Gods Commandements, but all the creatures rebelled against him: beasts began to grow savage, and retired themselves into the woods, that they might no longer treat with a rebell; those which are now reclaimed owe their mildnesse to our cunning, and stay not with us but because we have drawn them from the Forrests; if they obey us, 'tis out of hope of some advantage; and our rebellion having freed them from their oath of Allegiance, which they had taken in Paradise, we must feed them, if we will have any service from them. Those which do reserve their naturall fiercenesse, submit not un-inforced to our will, they must be made to suffer before they be tamed, and our power being Tyrannicall, their obedience is constrained. They are slaves which serve but by force, and who to free themselves from their servitude attempt somtimes upon our lives.</P>
<P>At the same time when the beasts fore-went their mildnesse, the Elements changed their qualities; <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Nullum est e|lementum quod homini aliquod genus mortis non minetur.</NOTE> those four bodies whereof all other bodies are composed, declared war one against another to af|flict us, and breaking the bonds which nature had prescribed them, intrencht one upon another, to the end, their division might be our punishment. They did that to punish us, which greatest enemies use to revenge themselves; they endangered their own losse out of a desire to destroy us. The earth which had served us for a nurse, became barren to make us perish by famine; she grew hard under our feet to weary us: forgoing her flowers where with she adorned her selfe to appear more pleasing to us, she loaded her selfe with thorns to prick us; she opened her bowels to bury us; and she who grounded upon her own proper weight, was always immoveable, quaked under our feet to work our astonishment. The Sea w^c^h judged aright, that our ambition &amp; avarice would not be contented with the Empire of the earth, <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Nihil tam ca|pax sortuito|rum quam ma|re. <HI>Tacit.</HI></NOTE> hid rocks underneath her waves, troubled her calmnesse with storms, call in winds to her aid to undo us, and advancing her waters into the fields, came to set upon us amidst our own Territories: the aire which seemed not able to hurt us, save by denying us respiration, corrupted her naturall purenesse, to make us sickly, lent her bosome to the Tempests, became the recep|tacle of haile and snow, and being serviceable to Gods Justice, be|came
<PB N="292" REF="167">
the Magazine of his Thunder and Lightnings, sent Pesti|lences into the world, turned a simple sicknesse into a contagion, and carrying corruption through all parts, did oft-times change the earth into a fatall sepulcher. <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Ignis an ho|mini in hac vita perniciosior an utilior jure du|bitari potest.</NOTE> Fire being the most active of all the Elements, did us more harm then all the rest; for this body which seems to be but a pure spirit, and by which the Angels themselves did not disdain to be called, crept into the Thunder, and agreeing with it's enemy, formed storms wherein the waters mingled with flames of fire seem to conspire mans death, and the worlds over-throw; contrary to it's nature, which seeks out high places, it de|scends, and gliding into the entrails of the earth, excites earthquakes, consumes mountains, and devours whole Towns: to revenge it it selfe for the wrongs which we make it suffer by making it a slave to all Arts, it burns those who come nigh it, it consumes what is given it, and not interessing it selfe with mens designes, it oft-times mars their workmanship.</P>
<P>But man was not so sensible of all these persecutions, as of that of the Sun; for this glorious constellation drew up ma|lignant vapours, spred abroad mortall influences, disordered the course of the seasons, parted the Spring from the Autumne, which were all one in the state of innocency; stript the Trees of their leaves in winter, withered the flowers in Summer, and bereft the earth of her ornaments, and riches. Amidst so many disorders, man was bound to make him clothes, and to rob his subjects that he might defend himselfe against his enemies. He hunted wilde beasts, clothed himselfe with their skins; he who had aspired to make himselfe a God, was brought to a condition of decking him|sefe with the hides of Animals, and learnt to his cost, that no ap|parell is proofe for all seasons, but that of Innocency.</P>
<P>Thus his being necessitated to cloth himselfe is a mark of his of|fence, let him do what he can to turn this punishment into brave|ry, <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> ista or|namenta dam|nati &amp; mortui hominis impedi|menta sunt qua|si ad pomp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">m funeris constitu|ta. <HI>Tertul. de habit. mulieb.</HI></NOTE> he is bound to confesse, that he covers his body only to fence himselfe from pain, and shame, had he preserved the respect which he ought to God, his body would not have rebelled against his soul, and had not this particular revolt been followed by a generall rebellion, he needed not have been obliged to seek for Arms to de|fend himselfe against his subjects. He sees then his fault in his ap|parell, they are sensible tokens of his disobedience, and would he

govern himself by reason, he should chastize his body as oft as he puts on his cloths: and yet we seem to have a design to out-brave divine justice, and to laugh at it's decrees; to glory in it's punishments and to make that serve for our glory which ought to serve for our confusion; for there is hardly any one who doth not some ways ad|vantage himself by his apparell, who doth not heighten himself by the Lustre of gold or pearl, and who turns not the shamefull marks of his undoing into stately Trophies of his victory. <HI>Adam</HI> was never so ashamed as when he was forced to cloth himself, the skins he wore were the apparell of a penitent; before that vanity had found out a means to imbellish them, they drew tears from his eyes, and sighs from his mouth. He never clothed himself but he bewailed his inno|cency, and when cold weather made him put on more cloths he con|sidered how the irregulariry of the seasons, was the punishment of his sin. <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">In sordib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> agebat <HI>Eva,</HI> ip|sam se circum|ferens lugen|tem, &amp; poeni|tentem, ignomi|niam primi de|licti, &amp; invidi|am perditionis humana omni satisfactionis habitu expia|bat. <HI>Tertul. de habit. mul.</HI></NOTE> His wife knew not as yet the art of trimming her self, all her daughters eloquence could not perswade her that that which was a punishment of her disobedience should adde unto her beauty; and comparing her innocency with all her other ornaments, she could never think to gain by an exchange, where for originall righ|teousnesse which she lost she got nothing but the slaver of worms, or scum of fishes.</P>
<P>Let us use what art we can to lenifie our losse or to excuse our vanity, we cannot deny but that our most gaudy apparell are the spoils of beasts; and that we are very miserable since betraying our greatnesse, we seek for ornaments in the bottome of the sea, or in the bowels of the earth, for what else is wooll but sheep fleeces? what is silk whereof so many different silks are made but the drivell of worms, and the sepulchre which those little animals make unto themselves when they die? what is purple which had wont to be the badge of Sovereignty, but the bloud of certain fishes? <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Sed lapillos qui cum auro superbiam jun|gunt quid aliud interpreter quam terra mi|nuta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ia: nec tamen aut fun|damentis de|mandandis aut pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ietibus moli|endis aut sasti|giis sustinendis necessaria. <HI>Ter|tul. de habit. mulieb.</HI></NOTE> what are Pearls but the warts of certain shel-fish, and the thickest part of the fome of the sea, which could not be turned into it's substance? what are diamonds and rubies but water congealed within rocks? what is gold which is made use of in so many prophane things, which men disguise in so many shapes, which is sought for with so much pain, which is got with so much injustice, and kept with so much care, but the excrement of a barren soil, to which the fire gives Lustre, and our errour valuation? what in fine, is the linnen cloth

<P>But if the materials whereof our cloths be made be contemptible, the cause why we wear them is criminall; for those who may be said rather to set out, then to cloth themselves, and who joyn pleasures to necessity, have for the most part but two designs, which are equally unjust. The first is to satisfie themselves, and to entertein their self-love by the care they have of their body; they will make an Idol of a slave, adorn a guilty person who deserves death, bring him with pomp to his punishment, and disguise his misery to flatter his am|bition: they are like those captives who think the better of their I|rons because they are guilded: yet all their ornaments are but marks of their sin and mis-fortunes; and as a foot-man who wears a gaudy livery makes but his misery more visible, those who trim themselves the finest make but their shame more publick. The art of trimming or adorning acknowledgeth no author but the Devil. <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Daemones in|strumentum i|stud muliebris gloriae contule|runt, laminas la|pillorum quibus monilia varian|tur, &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rculos ex auro quibus brachia arctan|tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, &amp; medica|menta ex fuco quibus lanae co|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">orantur. <HI>Ter|tul. de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">abit. mulieb.</HI></NOTE> He who taught the curious the vertue of herbs to make their inchantments, and the influences of the stars to order their <HI>Horiscopes</HI> by; he who taught the avaritious the way to purifie the earth, to make thereof the preciousest of metalls, he who taught the ambitious the secret of intrenching upon the peoples liberty, taught women to mingle colours, to polish diamonds,, to calcive pearls, to compose materi|als, and to falsifie whole nature to inhaunce their beauty, and to ac|quire

<P>The second designe of those who delight in sumptuous apparell is to please those that look upon them, to entangle souls in their nets, to purchase lovers, or slaves, to govern by the pomp of their apparell, as Monarchs do by the terrour of their Arms. This is the more usuall, and the more dangerous motive: the more usuall, be|cause vain glory seeks out a Theater, because self-love, as well as ambition, will have spectatours. <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Quod pro so|ld inani gloria vestimentum pretiosius quoe|ritur, res ipsa t statur, quia nemo vult ibi pretiosis vesti|bus indui, ubi ab aliis non po|terit videri. <HI>Greg.

They reserve their pearls and dia|monds for great meetings; Courts, and Masks, are the occasions whereupon they heighten their beauty; and when they have nei|ther witnesses to observe them, nor servants to adore them, selfe love is not of power enough to make them adorn themselves.</P>
<P>As this motive is the more usuall, so is it the more sinfull; for to boot that a woman that will cause love in another, runs danger of being caught therewithall her selfe; that it is hard to carry fire to ones neighbour, without self-burning; 'tis assuredly to imitate the devill, to serve for instruments to wicked spirits, to lose the souls that Jesus Christ would save, and to present poison, or a po|niard, to mad men, who would kill themselves. Let women dis|guise their designes how artificially they please, let them excuse their intentions by their pretences; the endeavouring to seem plea|sing to men, is never blamelesse, the desire of entangling them is always sinfull, and the care they take in attiring themselves, either to captivate them, or to continue them captives, is equally preju|diciall to their chastity.

<HEAD>The eighth Discourse.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>That the shame which accompanieth Nakedness, is a punishment for our offence.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>PHilosophers who knew not the secret of originall sin, thought nature rather to be the step-dame, then the mother of man, and that she had not given such testimony of her care of his preservation, as of that of other creatures: beasts are born with their weapons and their apparell; they are provided either of hair or wool to fence them from the cold, and armed either with horns, or claws to defend themselves against violence, those of the weaker sort have their wiles to free themselves from their pursuers, and if they want both strength and cunning, nature hath furnished them with agility to shun their enemies who hunt after them; thus we see that Lyons are armed with teeth and claws, and that these generous animals confiding in force, never refuse to fight when combate is offered, bulls have their horns, stags their coverts, wild bores their tusks, and all these differing defences, are so well munited, as a man cannot set upon them without danger of being hurt. Hunting is an exer|cise
<PB N="297" REF="169">
wherein danger is mixt with delight, if the hunters give blows, they oft-times receive some, and if deer or wild goats suffer them|selves to be tame, 'tis not without revenge. Foxes have so many wiles, as it is experienced as well in hunting as in war; that it is ea|sier to overcome a couragious enemy, then a crafty one. Does, Hindes, and Hares, are so swift of foot, as dogs nor horses can|not overtake them; these timerous beasts find their safety in their feet, and as the <HI>Parthians</HI> fight retreating, these overcome their ene|mies by running away.</P>
<P>Man on the contrary, who glories himself to be the Lord of the Universe, <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Quid est ho|mo&punc; imbecillum corpus &amp; fragi|le, nudum, su|apte natura in|erme, alienae o|p is indigens, ad omnem fortunae contumeliam projectum, cu|jus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ibet ferae pa|bulum &amp; victi|ma. <HI>Senec. ad Marciam c.</HI> 11.</NOTE> enters into his dominions without either weapons, or apparell.

He makes triall of the rigour of the elements, yet cannot keep himself uninjured by them: he is exposed to the fury of his enemies, and wants weapons to fight them: and nature dealing with him, as with a monster or an illegitimate child; affords him onely tears to bewail himself; he must be brought by time to the use of reason, before he can either make himself cloths or weapons, for fourteen years space he is a prey for wild beasts, and did not necessity make him ingenious, he would be the most miserable of all creatures. <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Cortex ambit arborem, pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> tegit volucrem, la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">a ovem in|duit pilus ju|menta &amp; fera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> vestit: Sol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> ho|mo inermis &amp; nudus nascitur. <HI>Hugo.</HI></NOTE> The rest are clothed as soon as born; natures self takes care of clothing them, their ap|parell constitutes a part of their body, and the hair or wool which covers them is the meer work of nature: but man is stark naked, when he parts from his mothers womb, his skin is so tender as the very air offends it, he must be put in prison, to be freed from the fu|ry of his enemies, he is treated like a slave to save his life, and he is not suffered to make use of any of his members, lest he use them to his own prejudice. When he is grown great, he is bound to make war upon nature, to preserve himself; to unrobe beasts to cloth him|self, he must use a kind of Tyranny upon creatures, if he will free himself from the fury of the elements, and he hath so little credit in his dominions, that as he must tear up the earth for food, so must he strip beasts to cloth himself.</P>

<P>'Tis argued against this truth, that the <HI>Barbarians</HI> continue their going naked, though they have lost their innocency, that shame hath not been able to make them cloth themselves, and that nature which is equall in all nations, hath not imprinted in them that re|sentment of shame which makes even the most affronted to cover themselves, and to carry this their argumentation higher, and to give it all the strength they can, they say that these people discove|red of late, are not polluted with originall sin, since shame which is the punishment thereof, hath not as yet appeared in their faces. They laugh at our apparell, and their climats being much more hot then ours, they are contented with such clothing as nature hath gi|ven them; and they leave us in doubt whether shame be a punish|ment of sin or no, since they being as well faulty as we, they are ei|ther lesse ashamed or more affronted. <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Illam perisse ego judico <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ui quidem perit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> pudor. <HI>Cur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">us lib.</HI> 6.</NOTE> To answer this objection we must suppose that shame <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Proque metu populum sine vi pudor ipse rege|bat. <HI>Ovid 1.

Though this re|morse was not sufficient to obtein pardon for hisoffence, 'twas sharp enough to cause shame in him; and that of reason which remained in him, was sufficient to make him blush.

<P>They lost as well the shame of sin as the knowledge of God, they lost the onely advantage which remained to them in their mis|fortune, and nature growing obdurate, they did no longer lament their past happinesse, nor were they ashamed for their present misery.

We must not wonder if those who have lost all the sense of humanity, have not preserved the like of shamefac'tnesse; if those who make greatnesse of courage to con|sist in revenge makes simplicity to consist in impudence: if those who eat mans flesh, do prostitute it, and if those wild people who know no religion, be likewise ignorant of modesty: but I wonder why Christians take upon them the fashions of Infidels, why shame|lessnesse should passe from <HI>America</HI> into <HI>Europe,</HI> why believing women who have no more familiar vertue then shamefac'tnesse, should imitate <HI>Barbarians,</HI> and that by discovering their bosoms, they should defie modesty. They put on their apparell not to cover themselvs, but to make a shew; that which served for their shame serves now for their vain glory; apparell which was the mark of their modesty, is now a proof of their impudence; did not the <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Periere mores, sus, decus, pietas fides, &amp; qui re|dire nescit ut periit pudor. <HI>Senec. in Aga|memnon.</HI></NOTE> wea|ther constrein them to put on cloths, they would go naked; their vanity is such as seeks onely occasion to shew it self, they cast off their handcherchiefs in great assemblies, 'tis uncivill to be vailed at a mask or a play; and they are ashamed to appear modest, where men use all their art to make them unchast.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THough we do not know all mans advantages in the state of innocency, and that that happy condition be not much la|mented because 'tis not much known; yet we very well know it was exempt from pain as well as from sin; and that man saw no|thing neither in his person, nor in his state, which caused either pain or shame in him. The body was subject to the soul, and the senses, which so often break <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Nudi erant &amp; non confande|bantur non quod eis sua nuditas esset incognita, sed turpis nuditas non erat quia nondum libido membra praeter arbitrium com|movebat. <HI>Aug. 14. de civit. c.</HI> 17.</NOTE> loose that they may fix themselves to ob|jects without reasons permission, did nothing but by her order; and this Sovereign was so absolute, as her subjects had no other inclina|tions, but what were hers.</P>
<P>The world was as much at quiet as man was, and the elements w^t^h by their contesting molest him, held so good intelligence as the one never intrencht upon the rights of the other; men neither feared the overflowings of rivers, earthquakes, nor fires; the earth was a temple and a palace, Religion did so well agree with nature, as the same place served man to do his homage to God in, and to disport himself in, he saw his Creator in every Creature, they were images which painted forth unto him the perfection of him that made them, when he beheld them for his pastime, his pleasure was not to be par|ted from his piety, and contenting his curiosity, he satisfied his du|ty. <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">In Paradiso etiamsi non om|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">a poterat a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e peccatum, quid. quid tamen non poterat non vo|lebat, &amp; ideo poterat omnia quae volebat. <HI>August. 14 de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">. c.</HI> 15.</NOTE> This Temple was also his palace, he could wish for nothing, neither for pastime, nor yet for profit, which was not in this stately habitation. The heavens served him for a canopie, and the irregula|rity of the seasons had not yet obliged him to deprive himself by buildings, of the sight of the most beautifull part of the world; the Sun was his torch, and when this glorious constellation withdrew himself to give light to the other half of the earth, the stars step|ping into his place, afforded light enough, not to leave men in dark|nesse, grasse mingled with flowers served him for his bed: Trees lent him their shade, and holes which nature had hollowed in rocks

Gates were needlesse when there was no fear of theeves, <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s est <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|minibus portus infortunii. <HI>Co|mic.</HI></NOTE> and windows would have been uselesse when people apprehended neither winde, nor rain. Nature had so well provided for all things as arts were superfluous; and her workmanship was so exact as mans industry could adde no|thing thereunto; all the fields were gardens; all Forrests, Parks; all dens, Palaces; and though the floud hath changed the face of the world, it's out-rages could not efface the beauty thereof. There be Forrests yet thick enough to shelter us, Champions of extent enough to weary our eyes, Vallies delightfull enough for diversion to them, and Cavernes rich enough to satisfie them: the pillars which sustain these forrests, are the models of our Columnes, the brooks which water these Champions, have furnisht us with the in|vention of water-pipes; the concavity of Trees hung in the aire, hath taught our Architechts to vault buildings; their proportions have caused Symmetry, and the Caverns in mountains, are the originall of our houses.</P>
<P>'Tis true that where sin had corrupted man, and disordered na|ture, we were forced to raise buildings to save our selves from the injury of weather; and not being secure in a condition where we saw so many subjects revolted, we were necessitated to build Cita|dels to keep us from being surprized by them. <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Necessitas brevibus clau|ditur terminis, opinio nullis. <HI>Marsil. Ficin.</HI></NOTE> But necessiy not being so ingenious as self-love, she was contented with providing remedies for the most pressing evils, and did not seek so much for accommodation, as for preservation. The first houses were but one story high, the earth afforded the materials, and Thatch was the co|vering; man finding nothing delightfull, in so sad an abode wisht for an earthly Paradise, and never thought of his former condition, without being sorry for his disobedience, which had banished him from thence: he never betook himselfe to this prison, but either when the nights obscurity, or the weather, made him seek for Co|vert; he looked upon it as upon his grave, and living in so unplea|sing an abode, he did by degrees prepare himselfe for death; but when self-love grew weary of suffering the punishment of it's sin, and when justling divine Justice it would finde out a Paradise in this world; it inuented Architecture, and taught man how to change his prison into a Palace: under the conduct of so good a Master he raised stately Palaces, he sought for stone in the bowels
<PB N="304" REF="173">
of the earth, he polisht them with tools, he ranked them with Sym|metry, and placing one of them on the top of another, he made his exile glorious, and his prison pleasing.</P>
<P>Those who will excuse this disorder, say that 'tis a work worthy the wisdom of man; that he is not forbidden to defend himselfe from natures out-rages; that it is to imitate God, and that every building is an image of the world, and an Epitome of the Universe; that time is requisite to bring things to perfection, that the first men were not lesse vain, but lesse industrious; that if <HI>Adam</HI> had been a good Architectour, he would not have left his children so long in Dens, and Cabins: that houses were the beginning of Towns; that <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> Philoso|phia dux <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 words"> pepe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">i|net in societa|tem vit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> conve|casti, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 words"> pri|mo inter se do|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> deinde <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">xi|sti. <HI>Cicer. in Tuscul.</HI></NOTE> men were never civilized till they lived within the circuit of wals; and that whil'st they lay in Forrests, their lives were rather bestiall, then rationall.</P>
<P>But let vanity make what excuses she pleaseth, it is not to be denied but that buildings as well as apparell, do prove our guilt, and that the excesse and pomp which are used therein, are marks of our ambition; for houses are built either out of Necessity, Plea|sure, or Vain-glory; and men seek for nothing therein but the pre|servation of their life, the satisfaction of their senses, or the ho|nour of their name. Our first fathers built only to shun the perse|cution of the Elements; they were contented with a house which saved them from storms, and provided that it would afford them shade against the Sun, and covering against the cold, they were well apayed: Architecture was not yet become an art, every man was his own Architect: after having cut out his clothes, he made himselfe a house; and seeking only how to fence himselfe against the incommodities of life, he sought for neither delight, nor vain|glory in buildings: two Trees joyned together did oft-times make a house, the entrance into a rock would with small cost, lodge a whole family; <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Tum primum subtere domos, domus antra fuerunt, &amp; densi frutices &amp; juncta co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tico virga. <HI>Ovid. 1. Metamorph.</HI></NOTE> and the thickets which now serve for a retreat for wilde beasts served to lodge men in: Nature was indulgent to these innocent malefactours; seeing they bare respect to Gods Justice, which did punish them; she allai'd the rigour of the Elements, and regulated the Seasons disorders. Though these first men were lesse guilty than we, and that their buildings were the meer workman|ships of necessitie, yet they did acknowledge <HI>Adams</HI> rebellion: as oft as they withstood themselves into those Sanctuaries of dirt
<PB N="305" REF="173">
and mire, they were bound to believe that during the state of inno|cency, the world was not an Enemies Countrey, &amp; that the creatures did not make war against them, till their Father had rebelled against God.</P>
<P>When they had lost the remembrance of the earthly Paradise, and their sorrow for the losse thereof, they endeavoured to content themselves in their exile, &amp; to please themselves in their structures, they inclosed whole Champians within their Parks, they changed rivers into Water-works; and Forrests which served for coverts to wilde beasts, into Groves, for the better ornament of their houses: <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Ager uni Do|mino, qui popu|lum coepit, an|gust<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> est: &amp; est fundus quod a|liquando empo|rium vocaba|tur. <HI>Sen. Epist.</HI> 89.</NOTE> that which did suffice to lodge a whole Generation, was too little to lodge a single Family; one man possessed more land then a Nati|on; and that which formerly made up a little Kingdom, was now the Farm for one particular man: they made Nature serve their pleasures; they corrupted her who gloried to follow Gods orders, did fit her inclinations to their designs; they saw no rivers, on the banks whereof they raised not up houses of delight; wheresoever the earth threw out warm water, they there made bathes; where the Sea advanced it to the Land, they there made fish-ponds, and pre|scribing bounds to this Element, which receives Laws only from God: they forced the fiercenesse thereof to be serviceable to their pastimes: they built Citadels on the tops of mountains, to discover the subjacent Countreys, and changing Champians into large pa|stures, they made their neighbours inheritances serve their delights.</P>
<P>But mans luxury growing weary of things when they became common, and despising what it possesseth, after having gotten from nature all that they could hope for, they disordered her course, to finde contentment in her disorder: they turned the course of rivers to inclose their Palaces withall, they raised up vallies, and levelled mountains; that they might exercise their tyranny every where, they found the invention of Arches to build in the aire, and of A|queducts to bring water into Towns; they planted forrests on the top of their houses, <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Non vivunt contra naturam qui pomaria in summis turribus serunt, quorum silva in tect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">um ac fa|stigiis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tant unde ortis radi|ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, quo im|prob&egrave; cacumina egi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ent. <HI>Senec.

But certainly they were forced to confesse that
<PB N="306" REF="174">
they were inconsiderate in building so great Palaces for a man, who during his life, and after death takes up but seven foot of earth, they grew weary of so great buildings, they lost themselves in these Labyrinthes, and knowing that they could fill but one chamber, they acknowledged it was unjustly done to build so prodigious a number of rooms, <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Quid prosunt multa cubicula? in uno jacetis non est vestrum ubicumque non estis. <HI>Senec. E|pist.</HI> 89.</NOTE> they learn't by experience, that what they could not possesse belonged not to them: and that to build in so ma|ny places, was to make lodgings for Owles, and to prepare habita|tions for Horn-Coots.</P>
<P>Vain glory reaped no advantage by the faults pleasure committed, but looking upon the works thereof onely as upon beginnings, she undertook whatsoever seemed to be impossible, and her raising of <HI>Colossuses</HI> and <HI>Pyramides</HI> was onely to purchase fame: she thought that of all mans works there was none more withstood the injuries of time, then those huge heaps of stone and rocks; she esteemed victories, odious, battles, bloudy; and thought that Triumphs re|quired Historians and Poets, to make them be known: she knew that Children were not immortall, that kingdomes had their peri|ods as well as families; and that the vertues of Princes were aswell buried in oblivion, as their vices: she was perswaded nothing was of so long continuance as buildings, that the vast greatnesse thereof, rendered their authors memorable to posterity, and that the works of so many hands and so many years, could not perish but together with the world. Upon this foolish belief, Kings caused <HI>Colossuses</HI> to be built of so prodigious a height, that ships passed between their legs with their Masts up and Sails displayed: they built <HI>Pyramides,</HI> the foundations whereof descended even unto hell, and their tops were lost in the clouds: they tired their subjects to content their am|bition; they threw all the revenues of their kingdomes into the bowels of the earth, to purchase reputation; they engraved their names in brasse, they hung their arms round about the wals of towns, and because marble is more solid then paper, they thought that that these monuments of vain glory would last longer then the wri|tings of Orators or Philosophers.</P>

people the world; they undertooke a piece of work worthy their vain glory, and not knowing the distance between heaven and earth, they resolved to erect a tower which should unite them both toge|ther: they thought certeinly heaven might have been taken by <HI>Sca|lado,</HI> and that without taking the pains to win it by their vertue, they might take it in by storming. No lesse then a miracle could disswade them from so rash a design, they laid the foundation of this building so deep in the earth, as they hoped to reach to heaven, after having come so neer hell: their work advanced insensibly, they had already outgone the highest mountains, they saw storms formed under their feet; they wondered that drawing neerer to the Sun, the cold grew the greater, they could not comprehend how getting so far from the earth, their approach towards heaven should be so very small, they lost the sight of men, the greatest trees seemed but as Pismires to them, and all objects appearing to them but as Atomes, they won|der that the stars seemed no greater. The desire of glory made them overcome all difficulties, their courage was inflamed by their passi|on for purchasing esteem, and the death of their companions that fell into precipices, could not asswage their ambition. Heaven <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Descendit Dominus ut vi|deret civita<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> &amp; turrim quam aedificabant filii <HI>Adam</HI> &amp; dixit, coeperunt hoc facere nec defi|stent &agrave; cogitati|onibus suis do|nec eas opere compleant: des|cendamus &amp; confundamus linguas eorum. <HI>Gen.</HI> 11.</NOTE> did compassionate their pain; to stop the course of so unprofitable a la|bour it put confusion into their mouths; and to divide their under|wanding, divided their language, every wondered that he had for|got his native tongue, and learnt another in an instant; the brother could not believe that his brother could not understand him, the fa|ther thought it strange that his son could not conceive what he meant and wives were much astonished to see their husbands change their language not having changed their countrey. So strange an accident put an end to so great a work, and parted those by force who out of vain glory had undertaken it, the people that understood one ano|ther retired into the same countreys; that which had divided them from others, united them together, and they imagined that 'twas the will of heaven, they should live under the same climate, since it had given them the same language.</P>
<P>Men were not made the wiser by this memorable example; there were some, who joyning industry to vain glory endevoured to imi|tate the works of God, and to make in this lower world an Epitome of the Universe. This was a more refined pride, and seemed more
<PB N="308" REF="175">
praise-worthy then the other since 'twas more ingenious: for Princes who built Tombs or Palaces had no hand in the work more then the bare desire; the Architectours conceived the design, the earth fur|nished the materials, the people were at the expense, and the han|dycrafts men contributed their labour: thus was the glory divi|ded, and those bare away the most, who certeinly deserved the least.</P>
<P>But when industry joyned with vain glory, honour was no more divided; he who laid the project employed no other hands, then his own to effect the work. Thus did ingenious <HI>Archimedes</HI> enclose whole Nature <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Aemula Na|turae parva re|perta manus.</NOTE> in a vessel of Chrystall; he observed all the moti|ons of the heavens in a brittle Globe, and if he could not infuse in|fluences into the stars which he there engraved, he gave them at least light and beauty: whosoever was in the midst of this in-animated Sphere saw the Sun arise above his head, and the stars set under|neath his feet; this transparent globe did at one and the same time shew all the secrets of Nature, and looking upwards or downwards one might there observe all the rarities of both the Hemispheres. A certein Poet, admiring the excellency of this work, <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Luditur &amp; fragili noster in orbe labor.</NOTE> thought he could cause Jealousie in his <HI>Iupiter,</HI> and in this belief made it be told him in his language, that the hand of a man had equal'd Gods hand: and that if it had as much strength as it had compendious adresse, it might have formed a second Uuiverse,</P>
<P>But notwithstanding what the Poets say, this Master-piece of workmanship did not survive it's author, the same age saw the begin|ning and end thereof, the ransacking of a Town put a period to this little world, when <HI>Siracusa</HI> was taken by the <HI>Romanes, Archimedes</HI> was there slain, and his work destroyed. Those proud <HI>Mausolaea</HI> which promised immortality to their builders, are reduced to ashes as well as the bodies which they did inclose, we do not know the places where their foundations were laid, and of all the marble and porphiry which went to their composure, nothing but smoak and dust remains, of all the stately buildings which vanity hath produ|ced, none but the <HI>Pyramides</HI> of <HI>Egypt</HI> have triumphed over time. Those mighty masses of stone remain yet intire, the Theaters, the Amphitheaters of <HI>Rome,</HI> which were built so many ages after these miracles of <HI>Memphis,</HI> are now nothing but ruines, regarded for their

But the <HI>Pyramides</HI> of <HI>Egypt</HI> stand yet firm upon their foundations; Thunder bears respect unto them, the injuries of time spares them, and as if Nature knew that they were built by the labour of Gods people, that they are the work|manship of their hands, and that the Coement <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Tempus edax rerum tuque in|vidiosa vetu|stas, Omnia de|struitis, vitia-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> taque dentibus aevi, Paulatim lent&acirc; consumi|tis omnia morte. <HI>Ovid. 15.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>That the greatest part of our pestimes are occasions of sin.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THough man had remained in the state of innocency, he would have stood in need of some diversion or pastime, his constitution which placeth him beneath that of Angels, re|quires that his labours should be intermitted by some honest recrea|tion,
<PB N="310" REF="176">
and his mixture of soul and body doth not permit him to be always busied. Nature, which serves him for a rule endev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s some relaxation in her labours: <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 line"></NOTE> the earth rests in the winter season, she sometimes sports her self for recreation, and amongst her serious works doth some ridiculous ones, which are her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ions or ex|travagancies.

<P>Though labour be naturall to man it needs relaxation, his spirit is too weak to be always busied; it is not of the nature of rivers, or of the heavens which find their rest in motion, as sleep repairs the bodies strength, so doth recreation repair the like of the soul, and change of exercise is to her a kind of recreation. But in the state of innocency, man found his delight in his duty, he unwearied himself in considering Gods wonderfull works, and natures beauties, which had charms enough to recreate him, <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> libet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> specu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> est in qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> nobis De|um <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE> had not power enough to se|duce or corrupt him; whilst he saw the stars he adored him who had given them their light and influences: whilest he beheld the flowers he admired him who had made them so beautifull and deli|cate, whilst he considered the earths fertility and the diversity of her productions, hee bethought himselfe how so many miracles cost God onely the speaking of a word, and how the nothing out of which they were produced did contribute nothing unto them but a blind obedience. When he heard the comfort of birds or the noyse of the waters he rowsed up his soul to his Creator, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> he had understood the language of those creatures, he sung his prayses who had made them speak. In fine, man was religious in all his re|creations, whilst he did divert himself, he did actions of piety; and Nature being mingled with Grace, whilst he did unbend his cogi|tations he did some homage to his God. But when sin had once cor|rupted his inclinations, he served his recreation from his duty, and took delight in nothing but offence.</P>
<P>All the remedies which we bring to this disorder have not yet been able to reform it: our most harmlesse recreations may become faulty, and we find by experience that whilst we think to divert our mind we ingage it in the creature, <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Indulge goul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">l <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">, nostrum est quod <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 words">, &amp; man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 words">. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 words">.</NOTE> which doth estrange it from the Creator.

there is vanity; if they do not ravish our hearts, they steal away our time; and if they do not altogether thwart Gods will, they hinder us from following it.</P>
<P>There are some men whose eyes are only busied in beholding the beauty of Tulips; they make an Art of this pleasure, and a serious occupation of this uselesse recreation; they traffique in onions, as Merchants do in stuffs: The price of these flowers is inhanced by their fantasticalnesse; an extravagancy in nature passeth with them for a miracle; they therein admire the mixture of colours, <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Adulterium colorum amat. <HI>Tertul.</HI></NOTE> they are not therein pleased with purity, and to use <HI>Tertullians</HI> words, if they meet with no adultery, or incest there, they are not pleased. their passion hath found out a new language to expresse the diffe|rence of Tulips: 'tis a piece of incongruity to use an ordinary term; a man must speak according to the rules of Art if he will be ad|mitted into their Academy. All the secrets of husbandry are re|quisite to cultivate these flowers, which do satisfie but one of our senses; they must be taken out of the earth, and put in again in their due seasons; and a man must labour all the whole year to reap some delight in the Spring.</P>
<P>The love of painting is yet of lesse <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e then is that of flowers; for let painters do what they can they cannot equall nature: their pieces will never be so well finished as are her productions, <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Pictura men|dacium est ve|ritatem imitans <HI>Plato.</HI></NOTE> nor can their pensils how excellent Masters soever they be represent the roses and lillies, which grow in the fields; yet we see men of good condition who fill their Closets with pictures, who extract vanity from whence the painters have extracted profit; who spend their lives in observing the Pieces made by <HI>Bassa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> or <HI>Caravaggio,</HI> who study to know a copy from an originall, and who spend a good part of their estate in buying of pictures, <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Honestius in|quis impensas i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> corinthia pi|ctasque tabulas quam in vestes pretiosas eff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|derim.

<P>Though clocks are usefull, and that the houres which they sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">w forth, put us in mind of the shortnesse of our life, yet cannot I approve of too inordinate affection thereunto.

<P>Learned men despise these recreations, and yet take o|thers which bear not more reason with them: the knowledge of Medals which was formerly only an help to History, is now the occupation of Criticks. They neglect the lives of Princes, to study their pictures, they ground their science upon the Caprichio of an Ingraver; such monies as were currant in the reign of the Empe|rours, are placed in the best parts of their Cabinets. <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Vetustas quae prodidit colen|da sunt, satis&abque; habent meriti si plurimum ha|beant temporis.</NOTE> They treasure up brasse and latten, out of a foolish curiosity, they change weighty gold for rusty medals, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> if antiquity set a valuation upon all things, they more esteem the picture of <HI>Antonius,</HI> or <HI>Marcus Aure|lius,</HI> upon copper, then that of <HI>Henry</HI> the Great, or <HI>Lewis</HI> the Just upon gold; they vex themselves about worn out characters, they ask advice of all Authours, to explain these <HI>Enigmaes,</HI> and as if they were ingenious to their prejudice, they seek in sepulchres the cause of their punishments. These Sanctuaries of the dead to which avarice bears respect, have not been able to defend them|selves against these men, who do violate religion, to content curio|sity. Nature complains of their searches, and all the World wonders that the pictures of the dead which have nothing of plea|sing in them can serve for a diversion to the living.</P>
<P>But if all these pastimes be the effects of sin, it must be confest that gaming is one of the most unjust and sinfull ones; it is autho|rized by custome, and because 'tis common, 'tis thought to be harmelesse; halfe the world have no other imployment but this exercise. <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Definit esse remedio locus, ubi quae fuerant vitia mores sunt. <HI>Senec.

love, and war do, joyned altogether; yet hath it so powerfull Charms as it makes it selfe be beloved of all those that it disobli|geth; it's Martyrs are so faithfull to it as when they have no more to lose, they notwithstanding languish after it; it's inconstancy makes them love it, they hope that after having dealt ill with them, it will make them amends; and being far from imitating those dis|creet lovers, who cease to pursue an ungratefull Mistresse, who paies their service with dis-respect, they endeavour to overcome it's in|constancy by their fidelity, when this Tyrant hath made himselfe master of their affection, 'tis almost impossible to get them out of his clutches; the losse of their estate sets them not at liberty, after having lost wherewithall to play, they continue to love it; and the will growing obdurate against what resists it, they never have so great a passion for this pastime, <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Quod non li|cet acrius urit.</NOTE> as when they are not in a conditi|on of taking it. Though I hope not to cure an evill which all the world holds incurable; I will not forbear to make the nature of it known, to the end those who are not yet infected therewithall, may defend themselves against it, and that growing weary by other mens harms, they may fortunately eschew the danger.</P>
<P>It's first disorder <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Ibi enim vi|tiorum omnium sed in primis irae atque avaritiae regnum est. <HI>Pe|trarch. Dialog.</HI></NOTE> is that it awakens all the passions which dis|compose the heart of man, it excites all those motions which mo|lest his reason, it raiseth those overflowings which morall philoso|phy endevours to calme, it irritates such Tempests as the other stri|veth to allay, &amp; causeth more storms in a moment, then all philoso|phy can quiet in age. Avarice waites close upon it; &amp; let such hand|some gamesters say, what they please, who do but bite upon the bri|dle, when they loose; and who bear their bad fortune with a good grace, all men play to win. This exercise is a kind of Traffique: 'tis a generall usury wherein every one glories; 'tis their clearest in|comb, who can joyn sleight of hand to good fortune, and who can lead fortune as they list. They are lesse egg'd on by pleasure, then by profit; and if they will acknowledge their owne weaknesse, they must confesse, that those who are most liberall, are avaritious at play.</P>
<P>Anger governs there yet more absolutely then doth avarice; a man cannot have ill luck without some commotion, <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Si qui ale<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> ludunt omnes perdunt, nemo unquam lude|ret. Nunc lu|crantur aliqui, sed lucrum illud arrha est damni. <HI>Pe|trarch.

<PB N="314" REF="178">
forth blasphemies against heaven. Ambition takes her place between avarice and anger; for though play makes all men equall, though the freedom of play forbids ceremony, though it be lawfull in play for every man to defend his own liberty, and that therein the ser|vant may argue with his Master, yet vain-glory hath a share there|in; men think winning an advantage, and that he that wins is ei|ther more dexterous, or more fortunate; and as if fortune ought to be more just in play, than in battels, men complain that she fa|vours the weakest, or the worst side.</P>
<P>In fine, sorrow succeeds all other passions in this exercise, for if the losse be great, 'tis always accompanied with sorrow. Shame and repentance set on those that loose, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Taxillorum nullus eventus prosper, mali o|mnes &amp; miseri. Nam &amp; qui perdit affligi|tur, &amp; qui vin|cit illicitur in|que insidias protrabitur. <HI>Pe|trarch. Dialog.</HI> 27.</NOTE> the one siezeth on the heart, the other on their countenance; they are displeased with all things: not knowing to whom to break themselves, they betake themselves to every body; and are bound to confesse, that contra|ry to their intention they finde pain and repentance, where they sought for pleasure and recreation. The second disorder of play, is, that it alienates men from their duty, and hinders them from doing what they ought, or from attending their affairs. All world|ly things are so linkt together as an evill seldome comes alone; one mis-fortune always produceth another, and it is almost impossible, that a malady doth not oft-times become a contagion. Great winds cause great droughts, and whil'st the aire is agitated with these ex|halations, the earth is no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> watered with rain. Droughts cause dearths, and all the husbandmans labour cannot defend us from fa|mine. Dearths cause the plague; for when necessity makes all things food, and that without considering what is good, or what is bad, men fall to whatsoever they meet withall; mens temper must be corrupted, and the body which is nourished with unwholesome food, must needs gather ill humours. Thus in a Kingdom, one dis|order is always cause of another. <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Pejus vivere sub principe qui omnia scele<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">a per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> quam sub eo qui om|nia ulciscitur.</NOTE> Indulgency of Princes leaves faults unpunished, impunity causeth licentiousnesse; licentious|nesse ushers in murder, and murder causeth war in the midst of peace. Particular families being little States, and Oeconomy being the picture of policy, one disorder never happens there alone; the Masters fault is always followed by the confusion of all the Dome|stiques. Excesse in gaming is an infallible proofe of this truth, for those who passionately love this pastime, give over the thought of businesse, neglect the government of their house, lose all their
<PB N="315" REF="178">
relations of Father, Master, or husband, and by one and the same fault, injure their children, wives, and servants. They lose all they have, in a short time, they morgage their lands, contract debts, and are constrained to keep out of company because they cannot appear abroad in their former gallantry. If the wives will not shut them|selves up with their husbands, they must make friends, and must in|gage their conscience, and betray their honour to continue their or|dinary expence and porte.</P>
<P>But if this misfortune which is but too ordinary, should not happen, Gamesters must confesse, that this exercise bereaves them of all their time, which is a disorder no lesse considerable then all the rest. For Time <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Rect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> lud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> iste latruncu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|rum dict<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> est cum rem omni|um pretiosissi|mam tempus sci|licet furetur. <HI>Petrarch.</HI></NOTE> is the most pretious thing that is, our salvation depends up|on the moments thereof; eternitie must be his reward or punishment, and we shall be happy or miserable according to the good or bad use we make of time, which is the measure of merit, the rule of good or bad actions, and these daies which we are so prodigall of, are the bounds which divine Justice hath prescribed to our labours. When the soul forgoes the body, and passeth from time to eternity, 'tis no more in her power to acquire vertue, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">hstand vice, she carries nothing into the other world but what she hath gathered here: good desires are of no advantage to her, if they have not bin fore-gone by good effects; nor can all the ages to come profit her, if she have not imploy'd past moments wel.

Time advanceth always and never returns, it is as hard to recall time past as to stop the present. When the Sun (which is the rule of times motions) stood still in the midst of his career, to obey a mans word, the present time ceased not to roul on, though it had lost it's guide, when the same constellation returned towards the east. to assure a great Prince that his death was deferred, the time past did not re|treat back with it, and divine Providence which changed the course of the Sun, would not alter the nature of time. Yet <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Nemo se ju|dicat quidquam debere qui tem|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> accepit: qu&ugrave;m interim hoc unum est quod ne grat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> quidem potest reddere. <HI>Senec.

life is iesse deer unto them then their pleasure, and they prove that passion blinds them since under pretence of pastime these shorten their life, and hasten their death.</P>
<P>But though they be guilty of so many faults, they still alledge vain excuses, and use false reason to defend their bad cause, they say that a man cannot be allways busied, that the weaknesse of his spirit and the misery of his condition considered, <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Lyram &amp; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|cum remittimus quo melius pos|sint tendi, ita reereandus otio animus ut ad la|bores reddatur vegetior. <HI>Plu. tarc. in Moral.</HI></NOTE> recreation is requisite for him. I confesse that this excuse hath some colour of truth, and that men who are most serious need some relaxations in their busi|nesses; but they must not make a trade of their recreation, nor must they contrary to the laws of Nature, imploy those hours in pleasure, which are destined for labour: as those men are to be blamed who turn their Physick into food, and who to purge away some ill hu|mours, forego their usuall meat, and take nothing but medicines. So are they likewise, who leave serious exercises to use such onely as are of no use, and who think they live in a world, onely to please themselves, and not to take pains.</P>
<P>Some others say, that it is better to play, then to deprave, that lesse evill is committed in Academies then in company keeping; and that those who are busied about play, trouble themselves not with their neighbours faults. That in this corrupted age, wherein the se|verest vertue becomes the subject of Calumny, it were to be wished, that all the world would be silent, that men were dumb, and wo|men deaf, to the end that detraction and idle talk were banisht from off the earth. That gaming is fortunate in producingthese two effects, and that it doth so powerfully possesse those who practise it, that they have no use of their tongue to talk idlely or deprave, nor yet of their ears, to listen to such things. That of two necessary evils a man must shun the most dangerous, and that recreation be it of never so little use, will always be innocent enough, if it can hinder revile and unchastity. <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Non ideo vi|tia in usum re|cipienda sunt quia aliquando aliquid boni effecerunt.

For 'tis not permitted in our religion to cure one evil by another. Morall Philosophy and Physick do differ in their cures, the latter hurts to heal, and imploys instruments and fire to dry up an Ulcer, but the other doth not allow that a man commit one fault to forego another, and knowing them all to be averse to vertue, whose party she mainteins, she equally condemns them. Saint <HI>Paul</HI> never advised us to use play so to keep men from slande|ring,
<PB N="317" REF="179">
and this great Apostle who loved chastity so well, never thought that an excesse in recreation might serve him for an excuse.</P>
<P>Though Idlenesse do cause love, all exercises do not extinguish it; this passion hath her imployments as well as others; after having co~sumed it self away in sighs, it is wel pleased to take some recreation, &amp; of as many pastimes as it chuseth, there are not many wherein it de|lighteth more then in play, it makes use as of an occasion thereof to see &amp; entertain what it loveth. It useth such freedom as that pastime affordeth it. It teacheth slaves to act two parts at once, and to ha|zard their money and their liberty upon the same chance or card, that Poet who was so justly banisht to <HI>Pontus Euximus</HI> for <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Turpe est ne|scire puellam ludere, ludendo saepe paratur amor. <HI>Ovid.</HI></NOTE> having taught the <HI>Romane</HI> Ladies how to make love, recommends play unto them, as a pastime which serves to their design: he will have all maidens know how to play, and that by a double traffick, they win their Lovers hearts and money. The Privatives which accompa|ny this pastime, are fitter to kindle flames of love then to extinguish them. This passion is entertained by the presence of such objects as do arise, she expresseth her self by looks and sighs, she furnisheth Lovers with a thousand ways to seduce those who will listen to them, growing learned in so good a school, they quit their losses, and oft-time of servants become Masters. But if all these sufficient reasons cannot disabuse those women who love play, and if they think it be a buckler for their chastity, we wil give them leave to play, provided they will give us leave to believe that this exercise is a cure for their incontinency, that the use thereof is permitted them onely to free them from love, and that knowing their frailty, they are al|lowed this pastime to secure their reputation, which would be in hazard of shipwrack, if they should be idle or solitary.</P>
<P>Yet if they will listen to our religion, this wise tutouresse wil <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Hae volupta|tes haec specta|cula Christiano|rum sancta, per|petua gratuita, cursus saeculi intuere tempo|ra labentia di|numera, ad sig|num Dei susci|tare, ad tubam Angeli erigere, ad Martyrii palma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> gloriare. <HI>Tertul. de spe|ctaculis.</HI></NOTE> fur|nish them with better means how to assist chastity, when it is assail|ed. Her enemy dares not pursue her in prison, those places of dread infuse horrour into him, and being guilty, she fears all places where guilty people are punished; she apprehends hospitals, and her delicate disposition cannot endure those houses where the eyes see nothing but objects of pitty, where the eares hear nothing but complaints, where the nose smels nothing but evill odours, and where all the senses find nothing but subjects of mortification. Penance is a bet|ter cure for love then play, and if women who seek to succour their
<PB N="318" REF="180">
weaknesse by this diversion, had kept their bodies under by fasting and penance, they would confesse that suffering is a friend to cha|stity; and that the fire which doth consume them, is the just punish|ment of their infamous delights.</P>
<P>The earth is an abode of penance; wee should not seek for pa|stimes since we were driven out of paradise: guilty men dream of nothing but death after once they are condemned. The sorrow for their fault, and the apprehension of their punishment will <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Dehinc cum de originis loco ho|mo extermina|tur, quippe qui deliquerat, pel|litus orbi ut me|tallo datur. <HI>Ter tul. de pallio. cap.</HI> 3.</NOTE> not per|mit them to take any pastime: he would redouble their pain, who should propose pastimes unto them, the most ingenious Tyrants ne|ver inhibited complaints to such as were to be punished. Yet it seems the Devil deals so rigorously with us, as he bindes us to recreate our selves after condemnation, and engageth us in debaucheries, to take from us the occasion of bewailing our sins. If we take any recreation, let us not forget our misfortune, let us mingle tears with our de|lights, let us take our pastimes as sick men take potions, let necessi|ty which ought to be the rule thereof, be our excuse; and let us not allow our selves longer relaxation, then is necessary to support the miseries of our life. Let us wish for that glorious condition where Saints find their recreation in their duties, where the same object which doth ravish them, doth recreate them, and where by an ad|mirable encounter, all the faculties of the soul are always imployed, yet are never weary nor weakened.</P>

<P>_THough the world lost it's first purity, when man lost his innocence, there re|mains yet therein enough of beauty, to oblige such as do consider it to make it's Panegyricks; <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Visibilium <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> xi|m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> est <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">, invisibili|um <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> maxi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> est Deus sed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|dum esse conspi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Deum esse credi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>Aug. de Civit. lib. 11 cap.</HI> 4.</NOTE> sin could not so much efface all it's perfections, but that those which it yet hath, caused admiration in Philosophers; and force Infidels to a|dore his hand who made it. It resembles their famous beauties to which age or sicknesse have yet left features enough to make their beholders judg that 'twas not without reason that they were adored in their youth. Thoug it be disordered in some of it's parts, though the elements
<PB N="320" REF="181">
whereof it is composed do divide it, though the seasons which maintain the variety thereof cause it's confusion, though Monsters which heighten the works thereof dishonour it, and though beasts which have antidotes in them, have also poysons; yet is it easie, to observe the worlds advantages amidst it's defaults, and to acknow|ledge that if Divine Justice have put it out of order to punish us, Providence had ordeined it for our habitation, and had placed no|thing in so vast a palace which was not sufficient to ravish our sen|ses, and to content our minds.</P>
<P>The curious discover therein every day new beauties to satisfie themselves; 'tis a book which never wearies those that read it. Every creature <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Mundus ipse liber est tot lit|teris exaratus quot creaturis, in quo possunt omnes legere &amp; intelligere. <HI>Chrysost.</HI></NOTE> is a character w^c^h represents some one of it's Authors per|fections, and Infidels instructed in this school have framed unto themselves noble Ideas of the divine Essence. In effect, the spacious|nesse of the Heavens which serves for bounds to nature, and which inclose all the works thereof in their extent, do point out unto us Gods immensity, who comprehends whatsoever he produceth, and incloseth within his essence whatsoever he by his power doth draw from thence. The earths solidity which serves for center to all the world, and which grounded upon it's own weight cannot <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Immot&uacute;sque mane<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s dat cuncta moveri. <HI>Boetius.</HI></NOTE> be shaken by storms nor winds, is an Embleme of Gods stability, who causeth all the alterations in the world without any change in himself, and who by an unalterable act of his will, rules all the adventures of our life. The Suns light is a shadow of his, and the prodigious activity of this glorious constellation which produceth metals in the bowels of the earth, flowers and fruits in the fields, clouds and meteors in the air, and which by it's influences doth rule over all the producti|ons of nature, is the picture of that infinite power, which shed abroad in all his creatures doth act with them, and accommodate it self to their inclinations. The incensed sea big with storms, the waves whereof rise up unto the heavens and descend unto the depths, her fury which threatens ships with wracking; and the neighbouring fields with deluge, is a fearfull draught of Gods anger who prepares torments for sinners, and makes himself be dreaded by rebels who would not love his goodnesse.

There is none but God alone who knows the greatnesse of his work; every age discovers unto us our ignorance. And though the earth be but a point, yet doth it consist of so many parts as we may with reason doubt, if what we know not thereof, do not exceed for bulk and beauty, it's known parts. That new world which our fore-fathers knew not, is richer, and of larger ex|tent then ours.

The Salamander doth for a while resist it's heat, and till his moisture which doth preserve him, be dried up, he delights in the fire; but if he tarry long there, his pleasure turns to pain, and he there findes his death.</P>
<P>The aire whose purity comes nearest that of the fire, is the abode of birds, they cut this liquid Element with their wings, they make new paths in those spacious Champians, they therein breath with freedom, and till man found out the art to kill them with his ar|rows, they laughed at his Empire. Their wings are oares which guide through this sea, their taile is their rudder, and when the storm is so great, as they fear being born away by the fury thereof, they take up stones in their feet, and defend themselves against the Tempest.

<P>The Sea abounds more in fishes, then the aire doth in birds. Their number is as prodigious, as their shapes, the species is there by miracle preserved, and Naturalists who boast to know all things, know not in what part of the fish, her fecundity doth lie. The E|lements which give them their life being almost always in agitation, war is there more frequent then peace, and the abode of these Mon|sters is the picture of a State divided by Civill war.

<P>The earth is no lesse peopled then is the sea: this fruitfull mo|ther is never weary of bringing forth children, nor of nourishing them; all the parts thereof are fertill: Desarts which produce Monsters, produce food likewise to nourish them; Forrests serve for retreats to wilde beasts, the fields receive such as are necessary for mans entertainment: and Towns afford shelter to such as we have reclaimed, &amp; made tame either for our service or pastime; every spe|cies is preserved by multiplying it selfe; Nature repaires the havock made by death.

Excesse in feasting cannot drain either the earth, or sea, these two Elements abound more in fruitfulnesse, then we do in gluttonies; and notwithstanding any debauches made, yet at any time in any Countrey; the fields were never depopulated. Though man be the Sovereign of all the world, he is much more absolute in the earth, than either in the water, or aire. He rules over fishes, and birds only by art; and since they dwell in Elements which are not con|formable to his nature, he must use violence upon himself, before he can fight against them.

The Lion hath won this honour by his strength and courage; all other beasts bear him re|spect; at his roaring all his subjects tremble; nor are Kings more re-doubted in their Kingdomes, then is this noble Animall in Forrests.</P>
<P>Thus all things in the world are wisely ordered; every Element acknowledgeth it's Sovereign, every species hath it's laws, and had not man disordered this great Republique, all the parts thereof would yet enjoy peace and tranquility. Yet they agree in what is requisite for the worlds preservation; <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Per propria singula &agrave; singu|lis elementa se|parantur, per communia sin|gula singulis ne|ctuntur: opor|tebat enim esse separata, ut sin|gula suam con|servarent natu|ram, oportebat &amp; aliquo nexu copulata esse ut ex his omnium corporum nasce|retur composi|tio. <HI>Procopi, Genes. cap.</HI> 1.</NOTE> though their inclinations be contrary, they keep fair quarter in their quarrels, &amp; do not forgoe all sense of love, when they exercise their hatred. Fire agrees with water to compose all bodies, and aire mingles it self with earth to give life and breath to all creatures. Every Element useth force up|on it's inclinations to agree with it's Enemy. In birds the earth be|comes light, in beasts the aire waxeth heavy, in fishes fire grows cold, and water hardens in rocks: if at any time they fall foul, 'tis always out of some good designe; and divine providence by which they are governed gives them not freedom to wage war save for her glory, and our advantage. The obedience which they owe to God, exceeds their own aversions, and the Commandements which he gave them when he made them of nothing, keeps them yet within their duties; they do not make use of their advantages which one of them hath over the other, and knowing very well that the worlds welfare depends on their agreements; they appease their hatred to cause it's quiet. The fire invirons all the other Ele|ments without consuming them, it is content to burn such exhalati|ons as come near it, and to set such Comets on fire as do presage alteration in States, or the death of Kings.

The worlds Basis hath no other stay then the weight thereof; that which ought to beat it down, susteins it, and it keeps e|qually distant from all the parts of heauen, onely because it is the heaviest of all bodies.</P>
<P>But that which astonisheth all Philosophers, and fils the wisest pates in the world with admiration, is to see that the world which is but a point, should be the center of the Universe, and that all Crea|tures labour onely to adorn or to inrich it. The heavens roul inces|santly about this hillock of sand to beautifie the fields thereof. <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Terra omni|um media posi|ta est circa quam coelum volvitur, quam astra omnia illu|minant, &amp; ipsa quoddam a|strum est quia immobilis. <HI>Al|cinous cap.</HI> 15.</NOTE> The Sun inlightens it and cherisheth it with his beams, this glorious con|stellation hath no other care then to make it fertill, and if he be in perpetuall motion, 'tis that he may adorn it with flowers, load it with fruits, and enrich it with metals, the Air forms no clouds nor rain, save onely to water it: And whole nature is busied in nothing but how she may oblige the least part of the Universe. 'Tis truth; the earth doth thankfully acknowledge all these favours, for as she owes all her productions to the Suns favourable aspect, she in token of thankfullnesse thrusts all her fruits up towards him, opens all her flowers when he riseth, shuts them up when he sets, and as if she were onely adorned to please him, she hides all her beauties when he keeps far from her.</P>
<P>Though all these considerations make the worlds beauty suffici|ently appear, that it's creation is the most considerable part of it's excellency.

Art which boasts to imitate nature, can produce nothing of gallant, unlesse it have some subject to work upon, a painter cannot finish a picture without colours, nor can an Ingraver make the visage of an Heroe without brasse or por|phiry.

<P>THere is not any one who doth not complain of the rigour which the creatures use towards man, every one is sensible thereof, and not any one seeks out the cause; those who ar|gue upon the works of nature, wonder to find therein so much dis|order, and knowing that the Government thereof is subordinate to that of Divine Providence, they cannot conceive why she should be so irregular: some imagin that the world being co~posed of so differing parts, can have no peace w^c^h is not interrupted by war: that the quarrel|ling of the elements is necessary, <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Eleme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">um pugna servat mundi pac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">m, sed mundo mi|natur interitis.</NOTE> &amp; that their qualities cannot be so well tempered but that they must be always in opposition. That the power of God cannot end their differences without destroying their inclinations, and that a body which is composed of fire and wa|ter must of necessity be troubled with an intestine war which threa|tens it with an inevitable corruption, that the seasons cannot be bet|ter regulated since the Sun going over our heads in an oblique line, doth according to the Summer or the Winter approach neerer to us, and draw further from us. That beasts according to their natu|rall Temper should either be wild or docile, that those which have most fire in them are the nimblest, and that those which have most earth are the heaviest, and the most stupid; that thus the faults of the creatures do not proceed so much from the workman, as from the matter whereof they are composed. This opinion is too injurious
<PB N="329" REF="185">
to the power of God to be approved of by Christians; and since it proceeded from Philosophers schools who did believe, that <HI>Materia Prima</HI> was eternall, we must not wonder if laying a false ground, they draw from thence bad conclusions; some others who are somwhat more respectfull, yet not much more rationall, imagine, that God made the world in the same condition that now it is, that he might fit himselfe according to the condition of man, who was to become sinfull; that he had no regard to his innocency, because it was not to last so long, and that he left some disorders in his work, to the end they might serve for punishment to the faulty.</P>
<P>These Philosophers seem to me to have lost their reason out of too much fore-sight; they do not consider that originall righte|ousnesse ought to have been as exempt from punishment, as from sin: &amp; that man in his innocency had had reason to complain, if ha|ving nothing amisse in his person, he should have found disorders in his Estate. God <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Deus non ante vitor est quam homo peccator. <HI>August.</HI></NOTE> always waits for our offences before he punish|eth them; and though his mercies may through his favour fore|run our services, his justice doth never through punishments pre|vene our sins. What likelihood was there to lodge an innocent person in an infected house? to make the seasons irregular which did measure a life not yet troubled by passions, and to give mor|tall influences to constellations, which were to enlighten immor|tall man? what reason have we to believe that man not being guilty the creature should rebell against him, and that the Elements should not be at peace in a body which was perfectly assubjected to the soul. I know very well that they reply, that originall righteousnesse, did free man from these disorders, and that serving him in stead of a buckler of defence, his body was thereby miraculously preserved from being burnt in the midst of of Summer, or frozen in the midst of Winter. But say he should have no feeling of these irregularities, he would yet have seen them, and his eyes would have suffered pu|nishment in beholding an unpleasing object. What pleasure could he have taken in seeing a sun, the heat whereof did scorch the grasse, and cause the flowers to fade, to which it had given birth. What de|light should he have tasted in feeling the earth-quake under his feet, or to hear the thunder roar over his head? what contentment would he have found amidst boisterous windes, and storms at sea? should he not have had some reason of complaint, if he should have

<HEAD>The third Discourse.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>That the Sun hath lost much of his Light and and Vertue through sin.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>GOd is so jealous of his own honour, and so carefull of our salvation, as foreseeing that the beauty of the creature might make us Idolaters, he hath left some faults in them, which teach us, that they deserve not to have altars erected to them, and the most illustrious being the most dangerous, since their beauty which makes us admire them, might make us likewise reverence them, he hath been pleased to abase them amidst their greatnesse, and to reduce them to a condition, wherein their weaknesse as well as their power doth appear.</P>
<P>To say truth, that beautifull constellation, to whose heat Nature owes her fertility, hath defaults which make it appear, that his glory is but borrowed, and that his Lustre which procures him so many Idolaters, is but an obscurity before God. His light which is the greatest part of his beauty, is but a forreign ornament, it was pro|duced two dayes before he had a being; God who would from the very beginning of this world confound the heresie of this age, <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Lumen ant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|solem produ|ctum est: nam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; prim&agrave; die fact <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> est lux quart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> vero facta sunt luminaria mag|na, ut prae essent diei &amp; nocti. <HI>Genes.</HI> 1.</NOTE> and teach us that accidents might be unloosened from their substance, did permit that the light might subsist without any subject, that it might enlighten nature before it was united to the Sun, and that all men might know, it was given to that glorious constellation, one|ly out of meer liberality: before this favour done him, he was but a part of the heavens, which was not considerable either for his beau|ty or worth, if he had any motion he had no influence, and this great body was not admired till after it was in-animated by light: all his riches derive from that alms which God gave him; he was not powerfull till he was lightsome, and he who had seen him be|fore could not have discerned him from the other Planets. That faithfull Historian, who hath so well described the creation of the world, teacheth us that the earth was fruitfull before the Sun had a|ny heat, that it was adorned with flowers and loaded with fruit be|fore

the Sun had warmed it, and that Nature had all her principall ornaments before the Sun had received light; the third day was destined for the bearth of Trees; one word made the earth fruitfull; this mother which requires time to bring her works to perfection, did in a moment thrust out Oaks and Fir-trees; <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Et ait ger|m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">net terra her|bam virentem &amp; factum est ita, &amp; factum est vespere, &amp; mane dies ter|tius. <HI>Genes.</HI> 1.</NOTE> and wondred that she had produced so many things before she had conceived them. The fourth day was reserved for the Suns birth; the Father of Trees, and Flowers, was born after his children; he who doth preserve them, did not produce them, and he who gives them life, did not give them birth; he had the care to bring them up, but not the glory to place them in the world; he had order to end a work, which God himselfe had begun.</P>
<P>But <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Dixit Deus fiant luminaria magna, &amp; divi|dant diem ac no|ctem, &amp; factum est vespere, &amp; mane dies unus, <HI>Genes.</HI> 1.</NOTE> nothing moves more wonder in me then to see that day should precede the Sun, that before he had done his Career, light had already divided the Evening and the Morn; that the rising and setting thereof had already made days and nights, and that time, whereof the course of the Sun is now the measure, had already marked forth moments and hours. The world was three days old when this incomparable constellation had his birth; that which holds of his Empire had received it's perfection, and this visible God made it appear in his birth, that he did nothing which Nature could not have done without him: as if all these pre-cautions were not sufficient to stifle idolatry, God would have the Sun to draw his Name from servitude, and that that language which doth so a|bound in mysteries, <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Idem vocabu|lum apud <HI>Hae|braeos</HI> significat servum &amp; so|lem. <HI>Schemes.</HI></NOTE> should employ one and the same word to sig|nifie a slave, and the son. We learnt from thence, that though he were the originall of light, he was not the Authour of Nature: that though he had heat enough to warm her, he had not power e|nough to preserve her; that though he were the King of Constel|lations, he was a slave to man; that his perpetuall motion was a mark of his servitude, that the difference of seasons was a token of his weaknesse, and that his Eclipses did prove that he somtimes lost his light. With what astonishment was the world struck, when it saw the Sun grow pale amidst his careers? what did men think when they saw a constellation which was in all things inferiour to the Sun, should obfuscate his beauties, should over-shadow him, that violating all the laws of Nature, it should put the Sun in shade, and make the night to reign in day time.</P>

Those who feared that the Suns swounding did fore|token the worlds end, were concern'd in this change, and were as much rejoyced at his recovery of light, as they were afflicted at his losse thereof. Good wits did notwithstanding judge aright, that his eclipse was a proofe of his impotency, that he was subject to such laws as a Sovereign Authority should put upon him, that he could not be the God of the world, since he was subject to weak|nesses, and that the Tract which he held in the Heavens was but an honourable servitude, since he could not shun the encounter of a Planet, which bereft us of his beauty.

He for our punishment doth corrupt what for our service he had produced, and as his influences do cause our health, so do they our sicknesse likewise; if he dissolve vapours into rain, he makes them break forth in thunder, if he ripen fruit he dries up flowers, if he form meteors he sets Comets on fire, if he make the dew fall, so doth he also the Sercine or Mildew; and if he deserve praise for the good he bringeth us, he merits also blame for the evil which he sendeth us.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>SInce Tyranny in Princes causeth rebellion in their subjects, we must not wonder if the <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Omnis crea|tura ingemiscit usque adhuc subjecta vani|tati non volens. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.</NOTE> creatures do disobey man, who treateth them with so much rigour, and violating the laws of Justice, imployes them in his offences against their common Sove|reign. For there is nothing in the world which hath escaped his fury; the most innocent creatures in his hands are become crimi|nall, he makes them serve his unjust designes, and not considering that he hath received them from Gods liberality, he abuseth them contrary to his Glory. Whatsoever presents it self before his eyes, doth either flatter his ambition or his avarice; that which in the state of innocency would have excited devotion in his soul, cau|seth impiety therein now, he turns all things to his advantage or to his honour, and seeks for nothing in the use of nature, but his plea|sure or his profit. He corrupts his Judges with gold, he tames his enemies with the sword, he kindles his concupiscence with wine, and this furious Tyrant abuseth all things to undo himself: his malice reacheth even to the most innocent Creatures, making them con|federates in his crime by an ingenious cruelty; for he finds out the means how to make the chastest serve his unchastity, he assubjects the noblest to his Ambition, and imploys the holiest in his Im|piety.</P>

without alteration of their nature; and their marriage is so exact, that they possesse in common all the advantages which nature hath given them in particular; yet impurity makes chrystall serve it's infamous designes in looking glasses: a woman growes in love with herselfe, by seeing of her face; she turns the fable of <HI>Narcissus</HI> into a truth; <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Se cupit im|prudens, &amp; qui probat ipse pro|batur; dumque petit petitur, pariterque ac|cendit &amp; ardet, <HI>Ovid. 3.

Who would have believed that impurity could have corrupted so pure a thing? that the flames of love should be kindled in ice, &amp; that chrystall intermixt with light should carry both smoak and flame into the heart of one and the same woman.</P>
<P>Looking Glasses were at first invented to the end that men see|ing their defaults, might amend them; many advantages were made of this innocent art; this faithfull Councellour gave good advice, <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Invent a sunt specula ut homo ipse se nosoeret.

Shee to whom nature had not been so liberall of her fa|vours, learnt by this true friend, that she was to amend the faults of her face by the perfections of her soul, and that she ought to strive for the advantages of men, since she wanted those of wo|men. <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Discebat in speculo famosus ut vitaret insa|m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">am, deformis ut redimeret virt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ibus quid quid corpori de|esset, juvenis ut fortia auderet, senex ut de morte aliquid cogitaret. <HI>Senec ibid.</HI></NOTE> A young Prince who observed in this true glasse, that he was in the Flower of his age, found himself obliged to undertake such glorious actions as render men famous; an old man who saw his wrinkles and gray haires in this chrystall, resolved to do no|thing unworthy of his condition, and seeing by his colour that he had not long to live, prepared to die with courage. Thus was the use of looking glasses a serious study; men learnt vertue by beholding themselves, and every one seeing his conscience in his face, put on a generous resolution to acquit himselfe of his duty; but incontinency hath prophaned this innocent art; in this corrup|ted age if men see their faces in a glasse, 'tis that they may endea|vour

<P>Ambition gives not place to impurity, and if the latter be inge|nious in corrupting the purest things, the other knows how to assubject the most noble. In effect, she teacheth Lions obedience, she fastens them to the Chariots of Triumphers, and having ta|med men, she tames wilde beasts. <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Homo Tyran|nus est, omnibus creaturis ad li|bitum pro su&acirc; ambitione abu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ens. <HI>Apul.</HI></NOTE> She engages Elephants in a fight, she encourageth these huge Lumps against her Enemies, she loads them with Towers upon their backs, she makes use of their Trunck, and teacheth them to war, that she may win battels at their cost: she makes the ground to groan under the weight of her Engines, the mountains to quake at the noise of her Cannons, she sends death by their bullets into Towns, and imprisoning the no|blest of Elements in Mines, she forceth it to blow up bastions to recover it's liberty: she tames the Seas haughtinesse, she forceth this Monster to bear her ships, to assist her in her Conquests, to o|pen the way unto her, to lead her into the farthest distant Coun|tries, and to serve her for a Theater to fight upon, and bear away victory. Thus man instructed by this bad Mistresse, assubjects all the Elements to his Tyranny, he forceth the inclinations of the noblest subjects, he makes them guilty of his offences, and strange|ly abusing his liberty, he makes them mutiny against their Com|mon Sovereign.</P>
<P>Taking the same freedom, he prophanes sacred things, &amp; makes the worlds most holiest parts serve his impiety. <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Coelum sedes e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">us; in Sole po|suit tabernacu|lum suum. <HI>Psalm.</HI> 18.</NOTE> For though heaven be the Temple wherein God resides, though the Sun be the Throne wherein he makes himselfe visible, though the Stars be open eyes through which he observes our faults, yet the Libertine abuses all these excellent creatures in his unjust designes; he disposeth of heaven as of the earth, he promiseth it unto himselfe after his death, and imagines he ought to reign amongst Angels&punc; after ha|ving commanded amongst men; he perswades himselfe that the Sun riseth onely to afford him light, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> tibi etiam imme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ito euntque sidera <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&acirc; caus&acirc;, eti|amsi major illis a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">a ac prior. co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> est. <HI>Sence. lib. 6. de Benet. cap.</HI> 22.</NOTE> that the Stars finish their courses onely to serve him, that the Planets meet not but to observe his adventures, and to presage his victories; and being strangely hoodwinkt&punc; hee believes that Nature is onely busied to finde him pastim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, or for his honour.

<P>The creatures to revenge themselves for so many out-rages, con|spire his undoing, and declare war against him; he sees no one part in all his Dominions, wherein he findes not either Rebels, or Ene|mies; whatsoever he undertakes he meets with resistance, and his subjects through despair resolve to free themselves from their un|just Sovereign, though by their own undoing. Of the so many ways which they finde to revenge themselves, or punish him; the two most remarkable are violence, or cunning. The first is more sensible, the second more dangerous. <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Pugnat cum Deo orbis terra|rum contra in|sensatos; ibunt direct&egrave; emissio|nes fulgurum &amp; tanquam &agrave; ben&egrave; curvat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> arcu nubi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> extermin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">bun|tur. <HI>Sap. cap.</HI> 5.</NOTE> For no man is so resolute, but that he trembles when he sees all creatures armed against him; and that wheresoever he turns his eye, he either findes factions, or revolts in his state.

<P>This war which appears so cruell, is not the most dangerous; for to boot, that we know how to defend our selves from it, and that self-love hath found out remedies for all our evils, it loosens us from off the earth, it makes us abhor our exile, and love our dear Countrey; it raiseth us up gently into heaven, and we may say, that if this persecution makes not Martyrs, it doth at least make Penitents. But the other is so much more dangerous, as it is more pleasing; it deceives us so much the more easily, by how much it flatters us more cunningly; for the creatures are in the devils hands, to seduce us, they are full of sna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">es and nets to sur|prize us, we can hardly make use of them without hazarding our welfare. <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Creaturae Dei in odium factae sunt &amp; in ten|tationem ani|mabus homi|num &amp; in mus|cipulam pedibus insipientium. <HI>Sap.</HI> 14.</NOTE> This Tyrant who got the Sovereignty of them, when he lost it in Paradise, makes such cunning use of them, as it is al|most impossible to avoid his snares.

<P>Every creature bears about it's dangers with it, a man must stand upon his guard when he intends to make use of them, and who sailes upon this sea, without very much caution, is in danger of shipwrack. We ought most to suspect such things as are most necessary for us; Necessity, which seems to serve for an excuse, serves our Enemy for a means whereby to undo us; he hath spread abroad his nets in all creatures, to surprize us; he covers the hook over with some bait that may allure us, and whil'st we think to satisfie our desires, we inconsiderately engage our selves in his designes.</P>
<P>The use of food, without the which we cannot preserve life, is not void of danger: if we will not become guilty, we must use them but as remedies; we are not only forbidden the abuse, but even the love of them: men sin against the Laws of God, as well in ta|king too much delight in eating, as in eating too much. Sobriety is a quaint or nice vertue, which is scandalized as well with the quality, as with the quantity of Viands: and if it be true, that our sins bind us to repentance, we ought not only to cut off what is superfluous, but even what we think necessary. Sleep is not so very innocent, but that it is somtimes mingled with sloth; all they who sleep to keep themselves in good plight, and who make their bed a place of pleasure, have found out the secret of making sleep sin|full; and of committing offences in a condition wherein the most guilty become innocent, a man must not love reason very much,

We draw our glory from our confusion, that which caused our shame, publisheth our vanity, and not finding wherein within our selves sufficiently to glory, we seek for occasion thereof in the crea|tures; we deck our selves with birds feathers, the tops of herons, and peacocks tails serve to adorn our heads, the labour of worms feeds our luxury, we make their graves our apparell, and that which cost those innocent labourers their life, increaseth our vanity; we turn grasse into cloth to satisfie our tendernesse, we corrupt Nature with art; and by a piece of extream ingratitude, we accuse her of want either of dexterity or power. Thus we hardly make use of any creature, without offending their Creator, we remedy our needs onely by profusions, and we are in danger of committing some fault, as oft as we satisfie any one of our desires.</P>

<P>I know very well that lovers indevour to throw of this yoke, that they strive to free themselves from this Tyranny, and that being weary of obeying, they fain would command their turn about, but all they can do is to no purpose, and the unalterable laws of love, force them fairly to submit to those subjects which are Masters of their liberty. The ambitious man would fain be the Sovereign of honour, but let him do what he can, he still remains the slave there|of, and whilst he leads on Troops and commands Armies, he is shamefully enforced to obey ambition which tyrannizeth over him. The Avaritious man would fain be Master of his riches, what ever pleasure he takes in keeping them, he would take more in spending them; but he is as it were bound to adore them and to dedicate all his care and watching to the Devil which doth possesse him. The lustfull man <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Homines re|rum mortalium servi fiunt, dum imperite Domi|ni esse deside|rant. <HI>Aug. lib. de morib. Eccl. cap.</HI> 23.</NOTE> wisheth that he were his Mistresses Master, and that he might prescribe laws to that proud beauty which domineers over him; but his excesse of passion keeps him a servant still, and the nature of love forceth him with content, to renounce his liberty; his slavery is a just punishment of his ambition, and Heaven permits that he remain a slave to the Creature, because he would have made himself Master thereof by unlawfull means.</P>
<P>This is the cause why he will not acknowledge any thing to be amisse in what he loves, why he doth admire the perfections there|of, and why he doth mingle his vices and vertues together: for to give right judgment of any thing a superiority is required in the judgment giver. Some advantage must be had over that whose weaknesses would be known, and lovers being slaves to those they love, their blindnesse lasts as long as doth their slavery; by a no lesse necessary then unfortunate consequence, they assume the qualities of that object which causeth their love, they transform themselves into what they love, and change nature as well as condition: but that which is most unjust in this change is, that these wretched crea|tures take unto themselves the worst of the qualities of what they love, and cannot take the best; and having a capability of becom|ming easily imperfect, they can never become accomplisht: a de|formed man loseth not his deformity, though he love an exquisite

beauty an ignorant body grows not learned, though he love a Phi|losopher; an ambitious man mounts not the throne, though he love a Sovereign; and covetous men grow not rich though they court wealth, but by a deplorable misfortune, lovers share in the faults of that subject, whence they derive their love: they put on all the evill qualities thereof, and having no design to imitate it, they resemble it in loving it. Ambitious men become as vain as the ho|nour which they idolatrize; greedy men are no lesse obdurate, then is the metall which they adore, and the lascivious are as base as is the pleasure which they so much cherish.

<P>From this just punishment another doth derive, which is not much lesse rigorous; for Divine Justice which cannot let a fault passe un|punisht, permits that men find their punishment in their love, and that the object which ought to cause their good fortune, cause their torment, for though love boast of allaying pains, and of making the wildest things that are, loving; yet doth he attribute unto him|self a power which onely belongs to charity, his deeds are not an|swerable to his words, and when lovers abused by his promises have ingaged themselves on his side, they find by experience, that that which ought to cause their happpinesse, is the originall of their pu|nishment.

<P>WE must not wonder if Philosophers have argued so weak|ly upon the disorders of nature, their not knowing the the true cause thereof, being by reason of their ignorance of <HI>Adams</HI> sin: they were of opinion that the evill was occasioned by the corruption of humours, and raising themselves to no higher a consideration, they took the punishment of our sin for a condition of

Nature; they thought that death was rather a law then a punish|ment; <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ex est, non paena perire. <HI>Senec.</HI></NOTE> and that the two parts whereof man is composed were se|vered when their chains were worn to peices through the long use of time, or broken by the violence of sorrow: they thought that the bodies rebellion was a necessary consequence of it's constitution, and that the slave being of another nature then his Master, it was not to be wondered at if he had other inclinations; they were per|swaded that the revolt of wild beasts was a meer effect of their fu|ry, and that man had no reason to complain thereof, since he neither wanted Force to tame them, nor Addresse to reclaime them.</P>
<P>Learning upon the same principle, they thought that Earth-quakes and Deluges were onely accidents which found their causes in nature, and which were as ordinary to the earth, as heats and colds to those that are sick, <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Suas ista cau|sas habent, net ex imperio sae|viunt, sed ex quibusdam vi|tiis, ut corpora nostra turban|tar. <HI>Senec.

They prepared themselves for these accidents, as for disorders, which were inevitable; and not troubling themselves with appeasing divine Justice, which chastiseth men by these dreadfull punishments they remained opinionated in their Errours; Ignorance would not suffer them to profit by these disorders, and not knowing that they were Punishments, they thought that Patience and Fortitude were the onely Reme|dies.</P>

<P>Philosophy hath not been able to find out a cause for it, she speaks of the deluge as of a fable, and hath rather chosen to give all anti|quity the lye then to betray her own ratiocination. To say truth, he that knows not sin cannot comprehend this disorder of nature, to the belief thereof, a presupposition is requisite that man is guilty, that God is angry with him, and that he will make use of his abso|lute power to punish him. All other reason is too weak to prove so strange an accident: though the world subsist by change, and that the elements whereof it is composed are onely preserved by their opposing one another, yet do not their combats tend to the ruine of nature: the peace of the Universe is entertained by their divisions; they sacrifice themselves for the publique good, and violate their particular inclinations to prevent a generall disorder. Fire descends to assist nature, when she is set upon; water mounts aloft to supply the place of vacuum which is the common enemy to all elements, the earth opens her bowels and loosens her self from her foundati|ons to suppresse the disorders which sin hath caused in the world; but it is not to be comprehended how all the parts of the world should conspire natures ruine, nor by what secret veins the sea could issue forth so much water as could drown her: the sea even when incensed useth violence upon her self not to overflow the earth; <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Usque huc venies &amp; non procedes am|plius &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">c c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">stringes tu|me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">uctus tuos. <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> 38.</NOTE> it remembers what order it received from God in the beginning, it u|seth violence upon it self, in it's greatest storms, not to out-passe it's bounds; it takes nothing in one place which it repayes not in another,

and from confessing by the fear which siezeth them, that without the reading of <HI>Genesis</HI> they know the whole story of our mis-fortune. To say truth, who would not fear a punishment against which Nature affords no temedy? who will not dread a disaster which sets upon Princes in their Palaces, and upon Conquerours a|midst their Armies? the statelinesse thereof is able to frighten even Philosophers; <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Non maxi|mum ex percu|lis, sed speciosis|simum fulmen est. <HI>Sen. lib. 2. quaest.

Then their con|stancy forsakes them, and nature which forceth them to speak truth, makes them make vows, and repent them of their insolence. The haughtiest of all the <HI>Stoicks</HI> hath been inforc't to confesse, that there was somwhat of divine in Thunder, that it was not the meer work|manship of nature, and that the flames and water whereof it is composed made but the least part of it's power. <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Caeterum mi|ra fulminis si intueri velis o|pera sunt, nec quicquam dubii relinquentia quin divina in|sit illis &amp; subti|lis potentia. <HI>Se|nec. quaest.

<P>But let this proud Philosopher say what he please, all men will not alter their beliefe upon so weak reasons. <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Non potest in nos tuum errare falmen quis|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">uis &egrave; nobis ca|det, nocens pe|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">bit. <HI>In Me|dea.</HI></NOTE> Thunder cannot be mista|ken when it falls upon the ground, it is not necessary that he who darteth it forth should measure his strokes; since whosoever he hits, is sinfull.</P>

them the more severely in the other world; if he snew favour unto sinners, 'tis either to recompence their good deeds, or the good deeds of their Ancestors; and if he punish the innocent, 'tis either to exercise their patience, or to increase their merit. <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Loculis inte|gris ac illesis conflatur arg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n|tum, manenta vagin&acirc; gladius liquescit, &amp; in|violato signo circa pila se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|rum omne di|stillat.

Is it not easie to judge by all these effects, that so prodigious a cause would have been uselesse, in the state of Innocency? for what need was there to govern them by fear, who suffered themselves to be charmed by love? why should the Thun|der have roared over the heads of the innocent? wherefore should God have armed himself, not having as yet any enemies? and to what end should he have vented his fury upon the tops of moun|tains, since if he punish insensible creatures, 'tis to astonish those who are rationall? In this sort of punishment there is also observed a certain malignity, <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Inest fulmini vis pestifera. <HI>Senec. ibid.</HI></NOTE> which witnesseth that it is the work of God; for it corrupts what ever it toucheth, it imprints evill qualities in the body that it burneth, and wine which is the best Antidote, turns to poison, if it be struck with Thunder; it leaves an ill odour, where ere it goes, and it cannot be a meer effect of nature, since it destroys all the works thereof.</P>
<P>We are bound to be of the same beliefe touching the plague, and to confesse that this sad sicknesse which hath so often unpeopled the world, hath no other father then sin. <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">erosi sumus mundo, vix no|bis elementd sussiciunt, re vera lues &amp; fa|mes pro remedio deputanda, tan|quam consura insol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">scentis ge|neris humani. <HI>Tertul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> dea|nim&acirc;.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Tertullian</HI> who isas full of mad wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">sics, as of errours, thought, that the plague was a pro|vidence of nature, which to case the earth which was not able to support her children, bereft her of some of them; and that like those Gardiners who use to prune such Trees as bear more fruit then they can nourish, she lessens the number of men, and reduceth them to a condition of not being burthensome to their common

Mother. Though I confesse that divine mercy doth oft-times turn our punishments into favours, and that it may aswell turn the plague to a remedy, as death to a sacrifice, yet I look upon it as one of the strangest Punishments ordained by divine justice to punish men withall.</P>
<P>I must in reason confesse that it is a generall corruption of nature, that it assails all the parts thereof, and that it disperseth venom into all the elements to cause death to the sinfull; it infecteth the air which we draw in with our breath, it gets into our bowels with the meat which we eat, it makes the earth barren by it's bad influences and passing from men to beasts, commits as much havock in the fields as in towns: this malady surpasseth the Physicians skill, it laughs at all antidotes, it is not to be shun'd but by flight, and it is sometimes so universall as men meet with it in the very places which they have chosen for their Sanctuary. Wee bear the seed thereof a|long with us, which it in time hatches forth, and shews it self as fire doth when we think it is extinguisht.</P>
<P>It is the most perverse and least respectful punishment of all those that befall sinfull man, for 'tis a rebell to all remedies, it turns anti|dotes into venome, and when it doth reign absolutely any where, it is fed with whatsoever is given to allay it, it assails Monarchs amidst their armies, the Lawrels which fence their heads from Thunder, cannot keep them from the contagion thereof, and that Sanctity which receives respect from other diseases cannot stop it's progresse. The most <HI>August</HI> and holiest of all our Kings died of this disease in <HI>Africa,</HI> his valour and his piety which had freed him out of prison, could not deliver him from his sicknesse, but after having triumphed over vice and infidelity, a period was put to all his conquests by a contagious death.</P>
<P>The holiest of all the Kings of <HI>Iudah,</HI> knowing that heaven was of|fended at him, &amp; that the anger thereof was not to be appeased but by a general satisfaction, chose the plague before either war, or famin, out of a beliefe that this scourge might aswell light on him as on the meanest of his subjects. In effect, it spares no man, neither youth nor age can allay the rigour, nor stop the progresse thereof, it mows down more souldiers then war doth, it cuts off more Commanders then the sword, it boasts of ending the differences between Kings, and of making them make peace by taking from them the means of
<PB N="373" REF="207">
making war. There have been some so contagious plagues, as have dispeopled the greatest part of the world, the seas did not stop their Conquests, and this vast element which serves for a stop to the ambition of Conquerours, could not dissipate the fury thereof; the winds served them for post-horses, and they crost the seas to carry infection into the utmost parts of the world without either oares or fails: the number of the dead was so great as the <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Dcest terra tumulis, jam ro|gos sylvae ne|gant, non vota, non arsulla cor reptos levant, cadunt meden|tes. <HI>Senec. in Oedip.</HI></NOTE> earth was not a|ble to cover them, nor yet the forrests to bury them, Physicians died together with the sick; Children dropt down after their fa|thers, and lost their lives in doing them their last duties. A man need onely to consider the horrour of this malady to acknowledge that it is one of the punishments of sin: during the time of innocence, the air was not corrupted, the earth brought forth no fruits which could breed bad humours, death did not reign where there was no guilty persons: Heaven, which breeds contagion by it's mortall influ|ences, did not punish those which it had not as yet <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Scilicet coeli reus sperare po|terat sceleribus|tantis dari reg|num salubre, fecimus coelum nocens <HI>Senec. in Oedipose.</HI></NOTE> condem|ned; our sins must have provoked it to have made it our enemy, we must have lost our innocency to incurre the dis-favour thereof, and sin must have wounded our soul, before the plague had seized on our bodies.</P>
<P>One may say that the same thing which causeth contagion on the land, causeth tempests at sea, that it conspires together with sin to undo man, that it unpeoples the earth to people hell, and that it holds Intelligence with the winds to sink ships. Some Philosophers have been of opinion that the sea did not belong to the Empire of man, that this element was reserved for fishes, as the air for birds, that it was an usurpation to sail thereon, to cut through the waves thereof to discover it's champians, and to penetrate the depths there|of, that Nature which punisheth all injustice had raised up storms, and formed rocks to revenge his Tyranny; but certainly reason binds us to believe that there was nothing in the world which was not put under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">he power of man, that his authority had no other bounds then those of Nature, and that God who had placed him in the world to admire his works, had left to him aswell the disposall of <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Dominamini piscibus ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">is, volatilibus coeli &amp; animantibus terrae.</NOTE> the sea, as of the land: but when through rebellion he became gnilty of high treason, his Empire was divided, his subjects contem|ned his power, and every part of his estate brought forth Monsters to destroy him. The sea is so fruitfull herein as the most of her pro|ductions
<PB N="374" REF="208">
are monstruous, every fish is an enemy to man, they are not to be tamed by art, and violence bereaves them rather of their life then of their fury. It seems that being by divine Justice imploy|ed against men in the deluge, they retain yet some remembrance of that first imployment, and that they think to revenge God as oft as they punish us: they by their strength overturn great ships, they leap into lesser vessels to assail us, they make storms in the midst of calms, &amp; being living rocks do oft-times cause the skilfullest Marri|ners run shipwrack.</P>
<P>This great danger is accompanied by the like of Tempests, which seem to enrage the Sea onely that she may drown the Land, or bury mankind in her waves. This disorder is good for nothing but to un|do us; prophane Philosophy findes no other cause for it; the more it considers the strange effects thereof, the more is it obliged to a|dore Gods Justice, and to condemne mans sin. <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Hinc procellae &amp; turbines hinc plurima morta|lium mala &amp; rerum naturae pugna secum. <HI>Plin. lib. 2. c. 38</HI></NOTE> The winde puri|fies the aire, and disperseth the clouds; the rain waters the earth, and vapours which are the originall of Aire make the fields fruitfull; fire doth not much consume the wealth of nature, it betakes it selfe to buildings, and punisheth our vanity in destroying our workman|ship. The plague it selfe which violating all the Laws of Nature, sweeps away the Son together with the Father, and buries in the same grave the Physician and the Patient, doth oft-times by the ha|vock which it makes, prevent the cruelty of war, and kils men to hin|der them from committing parricide; for when it sees the earth groan underneath the burthen of her children, that she can no longer nou|rish those which she hath brought forth, that the scarcity of victuals makes people take up armes, and prepare for war to free themselves from famine; it dispeoples Towns, dis-burthens the fields, and be|reaves men of their lives, only to preserve their innocence; but Tempests are only fit to punish either our avarice, or our ambition; the Seas rage is only usefull to make us know our offences, the deeps which open themselves beneath ships, the mountains of water which raise themselves above the Sailes, the lightnings which min|gle themselves amongst the waves, and threaten us at the same time both which being drown'd and burnt, are formed by the hand of Nature only to make us die with more of pomp, and more of horrour.</P>
<P>And certainly it was very just, that the Theater of our Ambition

<HEAD>The ninth Discourse.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>That Monsters and Poysons are the workmanship of Sinne.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>DIvine Providence knows so well how to husband the de|fects of creatures, as most men take them for perfections, and we gather such advantage from our misfortunes by it's gui|dance, as we should be unfortunate, if we had not been so. Death, which is sins severest punishment, is so precious in it's hands, as it seemeth rather a favour then displeasure, and a reward then a cha|stizement. Sicknesses are cause of so much good unto us by bereaving us of our health, as it were to be wished that most men should fall sick, and that pain might make them out of love with their bodies, to make them be the like with the earth&punc; the injuries of the Elements are of such use to the faithfull, as they ought rather to be praised, then complained of by them; when they with patience suffer all the pains which sin hath occasioned, they may make a happy use thereof to destroy <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Supplicium <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 words"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 lines"></NOTE> sin, and a sweet smelling Sacrifice to Gods Justice.</P>
<P>Hence it is that Philosophers who know what advantage we draw
<PB N="378" REF="210">
from our mis-fortunes, perswade themselves that Nature is not cor|rupted, and account her disorders advantages; they term death a law more necessary then rigorous; they call sicknesse the souls salve, the tryall of vertue, and the exercise of patience; they call poverty a dis-ingagement from uselesse things, a nearer cut to vertue, a help to argue with more freedom, they term the persecution of the Ele|ments an innocent war which causeth the worlds peace, a hatred which conduceth to a perfect friendship, or an excellent picture of musick, whose harmony is composed of the differences of voices, and contrariety of tones.</P>
<P>By the same reason they justifie the disorders of nature, and call Monsters irregularities which heighten her other works; they plead in the behalf of poysons, and make them passe for remedies, whose use we are yet ignorant of. In effect, Monsters seem to serve for or|nament to the world, <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Monstra sunt ornamenta uni|versi. <HI>Arles.</HI></NOTE> that they contribute to the beauty thereof, that they constitute that admirable variety wherein consists honest mens most innocent delight, that they are in the world what sha|dows are in Pictures, and that not to excuse them they are handsome faults, and pleasing debaucheries. This wise Mother hath her seri|ous businesses, and her serious diversions; she sports her self after having laboured, and to recreate her self after the pains which those wonders have occasioned her which she hath continued since the be|ginning of the world, she goes astray for sports sake, and for her pastime commits faults, yea her disorders are oft-times usefull to us; she produceth Monsters to fore-shew things to come, and goes out of her ordinary course to advertize us of Gods anger. Thus we may observe that in all ages, the birth of Monsters have been followed with some disasters, and the worlds irregularity hath <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Monstra sunt prodigia divini|tus missa, per quae non prae|sentia modo, sed etiam futura declar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ntur at|que praedicun|tur. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">amblichus de mysteriis.</HI></NOTE> presaged the like in kingdomes, All the predictions of Pagans were grounded upon these prodigies; they studied the guidance of Empires in that of nature, and judged of the ones disorder by the others debauche|ries. When <HI>Caesar</HI> and <HI>Pompey</HI> fought in the <HI>Pharsalian</HI> fields, and that the <HI>Romane</HI> Common wealth, was upon the point of being chan|ged into a Monarchie, beasts were the interpretors of nature, the E|lements violated their qualities, it rained bloud, and a generall con|fusion did foretell the alteration of that state. As famous Princes have had new constellations which have discovered them, Tyrants have had Monsters to proclaim them, and the Births of the one and
<PB N="379" REF="210">
of the other have had these Fortunate or Unfortunate Predicti|ons.</P>
<P>Poysons are not so mischievous but that some good use may be made of them when they are prepared by physick, <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Omne medi|camentum me|dium est inter alimentum &amp; vene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">um.</NOTE> good medicines are made of them; there are some sicknesses which cannot be cured but by corrected poyson: the greatest part of those drugs which we make use of to assist nature when she is weakened by sicknesse, par|take more of poison then of nourishment, and onely help the natu|rall heat by provoking it and by contesting with it. If they be con|trary to our constitutions, they are good for and do preserve some creatures; and if they be averse to man, they are favourable to the asp and viper: their venom is not to be taken from them without taking away their lives; the Antidotes which preserve us, kill them; and as if they imprinted their qualities in us when they sting us, their stingings are not to be cured but by their poison. Who knows not the vertue of venomous plants, is ignorant of the half of Nature: she subsists by contrariety, and as she indues her works with differing qualities, she must preserve them by contrary remedies; that which is hurtfull for some is good for other some, and amongst the infinite number of creatures <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Quin &amp; ve|n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> nostri mi|sertam natur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n instituisse cred<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> potest, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e in t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|dio vitae dirae famis mors le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|t&acirc; nos consume|ret tabe. <HI>Plin. lib. 2. cap.</HI> 61.</NOTE> whose Constitutions are so diffe|rent, there is nothing which is absolutely bad or unusefull,</P>
<P>These are the usuall reasons which Philosophy makes use of to defend her errour in maintaining Natures part, but being prest by truth, she must confesse that these Monsters are the products of sin, and that the earth never bore them till since it was covered with Thorns, the motions thereof were too regula<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the state of inno|cency, to commit any faults; the heavens were too favourable to it in their aspects, to corrupt it's workmanship: this charitable Mother would rather have been barren, then fruitfull in Monsters, and all her children were so beautifull, as she was not bound to make any il|favoured, to set the others off: she hath placed variety enough in her productions, without being forced to transgress, that she might vary them; though she be not always serious, she had never been debau|ched, and before she was corrupted, she would not have found her diversion in her disorder.

<P>But that which confirms our belief therein the more is, the rari|ty of them amongst beasts, and their frequency amongst men; for these innocent creatures being only so far guilty of our sins, as they are subject to our power, they do not stray so often as we in their productions: there is but one part in the world, where they commit these faults; and set aside <HI>Affrica,</HI> where Monsters are common, <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Asia</HI> do scarce produce two in one age; but men are ir|regular in all places, <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg"><HI>Africa</HI> sola <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 words"> est <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">, vix in <HI>Asia</HI> &amp; <HI>Europa</HI> repe|ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Aristote|le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> &amp; <HI>Plin.</HI></NOTE> the greatest part of their productions are monstruous, all their children bear the marks of their debauchery, and the punishment of their sin; we see the mothers wishes stampt on their childrens faces, some tokens of their parents incontinency are seen in the bodies of these Innocents; and generation is so cor|rupted amongst men, as they cause either horrour, or pity in Natures self; some of them cannot stand upright by reason of the weak|nesse of their legs, and are enforced to seek for help for their infir|mities, unlesse they will make their house their perpetuall prison; some carry mountains on their backs, and makes some that see them doubt; whether not having the shape of men, they be endued with the judgement and reason, or no; some are so deformed in their faces, as one would rather take them for Munkeys, than for the Images of God; others speak with such confusion, and with so much difficul|ty, as Parrots may teach them our language; some are born blinde, and are condemned to darknesse all their life time; <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">urdi, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">, d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|versa sunt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">on|st. or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> genera, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">er <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&agrave;m <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 words"> fre quentia.</NOTE> others cannot explain themselves, and their tongues not being able to speak can|not

All things in their purity are usefull to us, we dread not nature for them, but her corruption, and even in the very state of sin, we make use of them without either fear or danger. Owles onely complain of light, Harmony is onely hated by Savage beasts, a man must either be sick or mad to detest food which preserves life: but every body apprehends poyson, it must be corrected by art before the malignity thereof be tane away; to make any use of it, it must be destroy'd, &amp; it is so dangerous, as it oft-times kils those <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Etiam ve|nenorum odores pestiferi; tanta est eorum subti|litas ut etiam ferrum pene|tret. <HI>Plin.</HI></NOTE> Physicians who prepare it.
