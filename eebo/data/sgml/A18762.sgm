<P><HI>_IN calling to minde right</HI> honourable, the continuance of your fauour and amiable countenance to|wards me: I found my selfe indetted and vnable (but by affection or good will) to deserue the least part of your curtesies, yet looking on your manie yeares spent in learning and knowledge (for the which vertue, God hath called you to an honourable place) I thought by some studie (albeit my iudgement weake) to lead on your good liking so farre into my labors, that you shold not only affect my writings: but also accept the poor present I offer. which although they be but papers stuffed full of verses, yet the plaiines of the matter and good mea|ning of the writer I hope shall purchase some small season (as a passing of the time) to make you beholde the willing paines I bestow. This first presumption penneth out the Epitaphs of 2. good Kings that gouerned this land of late, and sheweth by Epitaphs 3. other most honorable Coun|sellers that dyed not long agoe: vnto the which 5. great personages I was bound for benefits receiued, and so in the end of my dayes (which cannot be long) to be thankful for good turnes and discharging of dutie, I haue set foorth by

The Tragedies in my next book called my Challenge) shal make manifest at the full the effect of those passages: of which Tragedyes you shall haue a sufficient portion, that therby the world shall see what wrong I haue suffred to endure a deniall (by busie tunges) of mine owne workes: Shores wife shall speake in her kinde, to defend me and such as waites on her (because her good fortunes were worthy waiting on) shall tell the world I haue beene abused, and not iustly and rightly vnderstood: and in gods good giftes for his glories sake, my book of Chalenge shal chalenge all honest labours that euer I did in my daies, deny them who please. Now these bare verses and barren Epitaphes bringing no better frute but the death of some one or other, makes euery line vnwelcome that showes no cheerfull newes: but time that discouers all accidents (and death in his fury) brings pardon by the trueth that is found and such as in seasonable time do truly vtter that becomes them, are halfe excused though their boldnes be great: So neither fearing the open barker that makes a great bruite, nor the priuie byter that makes a great wou~d, to the mild|nes of your sweet censure I offer these plaine Epitaphs that follow, partly to make you beleeue I am mindfull of my promise, and cheefely for that I know my L. Chancellers death was sorowfull vnto you, so knoweth God who en|crease your honorable credite.</P>

<LG>
<L>THe flower whose smell is past, lyes dead like withered weed:</L>
<L>the blosom burnt with scorchig blast, yeelds nether senxt nor seed</L>
<L>The Sunnie day declin'd, lookes like di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">e darksome night:</L>
<L>Cleere clowds o're cast with blustring wind; soon loseth former light.</L>
<L>The tree that axe hewes downe, lies flat where bowes do fall:</L>
<L>And greater things of more renown, are scarce thought of at all.</L>
<L>When their decay drawes on, bid rotten frute a dew:</L>
<L>When olde delights are dead and gone, world welcomes fancies new.</L>
<L>Olde Kinges whose glory shone, as bright as <HI>Phoebus</HI> face:</L>
<L>Lyes lowe in <HI>Windsor</HI> now alone, with no great-Princely grace.</L>
<L>To write of <HI>Henryes</HI> raigne, a true discourse to tell:</L>
<L>A world of wit it would containe, and please the readers well.</L>
<L>For such a King as he, (though heer bewail'd with pen)</L>
<L>Ought still of dutie honourd be, among all English men.</L>
<L>His loue to Countryes soyle, (like-Father to his sonne)</L>
<L>Kept all true subiects free from foile, how ere worlds course did run.</L>
<L>His woord no sooner past, but at a becke obayd:</L>
<L>He stood like Fort full firme and fast, and made his foes affraid.</L>
<L>His bountie did abound, his largesse had no end:</L>
<L>Gaue freely where desartes he found, yet had inough to spend.</L>
<L>A flowing Fountaine head, that ran faire streames of golde:</L>
<L>To euery place (through pypes of lead) and Conduits treble-folde.</L>
<L>But cheefely to those men, whose seruice crau'de reward:</L>
<L>There sprouting springs gusht now &amp; then, great grace with great re|gard.</L>
<L>A glorie great he took, in giuing golde as drosse:</L>
<L>As one that still for fame did look, disdaining mucke and mosse.</L>
<L>A Lyon in the feild, that made wilde tygers tame:</L>
<L>And many a woorthie Towne to yeeld, so fearfull was his name.</L>
<L>A King that made Kings stoop, and held them all in awe:</L>
<L>When he him selfe did neuer droop, for any thing he saw.</L>
<L>A King that took no wrong, of none in deed nor word:</L>
<L>But would haue right ere it were long, or trye the same with sword.</L>
<L>The Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the fift, came here his loue to craue:</L>
<L>The French King met our King at <HI>Guynes,</HI> his fauour for to haue.</L>
<L>And when he was in <HI>Fraunce,</HI> as fortune flong the maine:</L>
<L>At <HI>Flowdan</HI> feilde as was the chaunce, a noble King was slaine.</L>

<L>Wonne <HI>Bulleigne</HI> after this, built neere it many a seat:</L>
<L>All yeeldes where King in person is, his presence was so great.</L>
<L>Whiles these things were in hand, as doutfull ballance stood:</L>

<L>IN thirtie yeres there dropt away, from mightye <HI>Caesars</HI> traine:</L>
<L>Of cheef account that bore great sway, twice 10. twice 4. &amp; twaine.</L>
<L>That rul'd by course in Senate seate, whilst glasse of life did run:</L>
<L>Whose fearfull frown&punc; and angry threat, good subiects sought to shun.</L>
<L>Ech one found freends to waile below, their death with greife of brest</L>
<L>When from this world these guides did goe, to place of greater rest.</L>
<L>But few in Court, gaind more good will, the~ wise graue <HI>Mildmay</HI> did:</L>

<L>In Court not only lou'd alone, but Country yeelds him fame:</L>
<L>and boasts, that there his bounty shone, &amp; burnd with que~chles flame</L>
<L>Like blazing torche on mountaine top, that could all blasts abide:</L>
<L>Yet seem'd but little twinckling Star, which is farre off espyed.</L>
<L>But euery worde and sentence sweet, he did in world let fall:</L>
<L>Exprest an hye and noble spirit, and knowledge great withall.</L>
<L>His silence spake by stayed lookes, but when he moou'd his tongue:</L>

<L>No malice, wrath, nor angry rage, nor sullen nature strange:</L>

<L>A Father that could rules set downe, of law and learned lore:</L>
<L>Knit vp such pointes in sentence short, as few had heard before.</L>
<L>To Princ and state a member fit, that Country could not spare:</L>
<L>Right sharp of sence, profound of wit, of iudgement deep and rare.</L>
<L>To suters all of nature good, but to the Princes men:</L>
<L>A ready help from root of hart, with head, with hand and pen.</L>

<L>His promise wrought performance straight, yet ware &amp; wise to speak</L>
<L>Not won with gifts or worldly sleight, that makes men promis break.</L>
<L>But drawne by iudgement and desart, to showe his godly zeale:</L>

<L>Vaine pomp is but a puffe or toy, so is both rule and raigne:</L>
<L>For all that heere we do enioy, is nought but woe and paine:</L>

<L>Most plain of words, most plain of deeds, plain dealing led him throgh</L>
