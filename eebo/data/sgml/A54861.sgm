<P>&sect;. 2. Having thus premised the Fellows <HI>Oath</HI> which had been taken by Dr. <HI>Yerburie,</HI> and of which he had been often <HI>put in</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Note that Dr. <HI>Yerbury</HI> being admo|nished of his <HI>Oath against Appealing,</HI> was <HI>thankful</HI> for the chari|ty of that ad|monition; saying first to the <HI>President,</HI> and afterwards to Mr. <HI>Basket</HI> (in these <HI>words,</HI> or to this <HI>effect,</HI>) I am not so much in love with <HI>per|jury,</HI> as to break my <HI>oath</HI> to <HI>no purpose</HI>; nor so fond of an <HI>expulsion,</HI> as to incur it by an <HI>Appeal.</HI></NOTE> <HI>mind</HI> by the <HI>Praesident,</HI> an Oath excluding the possibility of <HI>Appeal</HI> in the case of <HI>punishments</HI> and <HI>corrections,</HI> to any power or person to be imagin'd, much <HI>more</HI> to the <HI>Visitor,</HI> the <HI>Bounds</HI> and <HI>Limits</HI> of whose <HI>Power</HI> were fitly set him by the <HI>Founder,</HI> (as being an <HI>Officer</HI> of his <HI>Creating</HI>;) let us consider how this Oath may be illustrated or explain'd by <HI>several statutes,</HI> wherein <HI>Appeals</HI> and <HI>Complaints</HI> are interdicted by the <HI>Founder,</HI> and which the <HI>Fellows</HI> of the College are <HI>sworn</HI> to <HI>keep.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="3"><NOTE PLACE="marg">And from the several fol|lowing <HI>Sta|tutes,</HI> which every <HI>Fellow</HI> is <HI>sworn</HI> to <HI>keep.</HI></NOTE>First in the Statute [<HI>de Lectura statutorum, &amp; scrutinio pro delictis detegendis haben|do,</HI> cap. 16. p. 46, &amp; 47.,] <Q>when any person of any quality shall be punished at the discretion of the President and the Deans (or any <HI>one</HI> of Them,) The person punish|ed is injoyned to undergo his correction, <HI>Cessantibus QVIBVSCVNQVE Pro|vocationibus, Appellationibus, &amp; aliis Iuris &amp; Facti Remediis, per quas, seu per quae ipsius delinquentis correctio &amp; punitio differri valeat, seu alias quomodolibet impediri, sub poena amotionis perpetuae &agrave; Collegio memorato.</HI></Q> Here the punished party, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Cap.</HI> 16. <HI>p.</HI> 47.</NOTE> al|though he <HI>knows not his accuser,</HI> and is <HI>bound not to know</HI> him <HI>sub poena perjurii,</HI> is yet obliged to acquiesce in whatever punishment is inflicted, <HI>without any Complaints or Ap|peals of any kind whatsoever, and without all kind of remedy</HI>; and all <HI>under the penalty of perpetual Banishment from the College.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, in the Statute <HI>de correctionibus faciendis circa delicta leviora</HI>&mdash;(cap. 25. p. 62, 63.) The <HI>Fellows</HI> are capable of being <HI>put out of Commons,</HI> (and <HI>de facto</HI> have been often by Dr. <HI>Frewen,</HI> oftner yet by Dr. <HI>Langton,</HI> extreamly often by Dr. <HI>Humphry,</HI> as appears by the College Registers,) even by the strength of that weakest Statute: <Q><HI>Ipsumque nihilominus sic delinquentem, juxta excessum &amp; delicti qualitatem, Praeses Predictus (vel vice-Praeses absente Praeside) cum consensu duorum Decanorum, vel saltem unius, corrigat puniatque pro commissis: Quam correctionem &amp; punitionem, cul|pabilis in ca parte absque contradictionis, APPELLATIONIS, vel QVERELAE obstaculo, sustineat patienter: &amp; si similia fecerit post, arcti&ugrave;s &amp; acri&ugrave;s procedatur contra cum,</HI> &amp;c.</Q> Here <HI>Complaints</HI> and <HI>Appeals</HI> are made to be <HI>morally impossible.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, in the Statute [<HI>de correctione sociorum super majoribus criminibus defamato|rum,</HI> Cap. 27. p. 65, 66.) If any Fellow shall be guilty of manifest perjurie, or Breach of oath, of theft, of conspiracie against the good estate of the College, or of any other Fact bringing prejudice or scandal to the same; &amp; shall be convicted of it, either by his own confession, or by competent witnesses to be approved of in the judgement of the Presi|dent, with the assistance of the Vice-President, two Deans, and Bursers of the College, or by evidence of the Fact; <Q>EX TUNC <HI>&agrave; dicto Collegio praesentis nostrae ordinationis vigore,</HI> nulla alia praemissa monitone, <HI>eum exclusum, &amp; privatum fore</HI> ipso facto <HI>decernimus &amp; statuimus, absque</HI> CUJUSCUNQUE APPELLATIONIS remedio vel QUE|RELAE.</Q> Here <HI>all Remedy</HI> by <HI>Complaint</HI> or by <HI>Appeal in any kind,</HI> is most strictly for|bidden in the case of <HI>expulsion.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, in the Statute, by which Dr. <HI>Yerbury</HI> was put out of Commons, (<HI>cap.</HI> 35, <HI>p.</HI> 92.) The President sitting with the Deans and Bursars, and other Fellows whom They shall choose, is to put an end to all dissensions and quarrels, <HI>within the College walls.</HI> Which proves, that in That, as in many other cases within the College, (though not in all,) the President with his Assessors is <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>&amp; le dernier Re|sort de la Iustice.</HI> The Founders own words are precisely These. <Q><HI>Nec liceat alicui de dicto Collegio cujuscunque status aut gradus extiterit, occasione alicujus Irae, Rixae, Iurgii aut dissensionis infra dictum Coll. ortae vel motae inter eosdem, persecutionem fa|cere, aut litem aliquam movere, vel aliquem impetere, aut ad judicium trahere, coram aliquo judice extrinseco Ecclesiastico vel seculari.</HI> And that by <HI>judex extrinsecus,</HI> he means the Visitor himself, as well as any other foreign Judge, is undeniably ap|parent from the very next words; <HI>Sed volumus quod omnino hujusmodi jurgia, irae, rixae, discordiae, &amp; dissensiones, infra dictum Collegium per personas praedictas,</HI> (to wit the President, Vice-President, Deans and Bursars) <HI>aliqua ordinatione bona seu con|cordia</HI> FINALITER <HI>terminentur, &amp; etiam decidantur.</HI> And in the same Statute, <HI>quic|quid ipse Praesidens cum Vice-Praesidente, Decanis, &amp; Bursariis, in praemissis duxerit ordinandum, per partes hujusmodi discordantes firmiter observetur, &amp; executioni absque contradictione qualibet demandetur.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Fifthly, at the close of the very same Statute (<HI>p.</HI> 93.) there is to be found this other instance of the Presidents being impowered, yea, appointed and injoyn'd (toge|ther with Them above recited) <HI>ipso facto</HI> to expel a <HI>disturber</HI> of the <HI>peace</HI> and <HI>unity</HI> of the College, <HI>as a perjur'd transgressor</HI> of College Statutes. <Q><HI>Si post monitionem Prae|sidentis, aut eo absente Vice-Praesidentis ab incepto non desistaet, si judicio eorundem, &amp; majoris partis</HI> 13. <HI>Seniorum in ea parte culpabilis, &amp; parere recusans reperiatur, tunc ipsum ut unitatis &amp; pacis perturbatorem, &amp; statutorum Coll. nostri violator<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">m tan|quam</HI> Perjurum <HI>perpetuo exclusum, &amp; amotum decernimus ipso facto.</HI></Q> In which case, there cannot be place for an <HI>Appeal,</HI> be the sentence right or wrong, if such as 'tis, it is given, <HI>judicio Praesidentis &amp; Assistentium</HI>; for that is all that the Statute does
<PB N="3" REF="3" MS="y">
require to the expulsion spoken of, though that <HI>Iudicium</HI> should be <HI>erroneum.</HI> Exactly so it is in that other statute, by which we sentence't Dr. <HI>Yerburie</HI> to a much lesser punishment. <HI>Si Iudicio Praesidentis &amp; unius Decanorum reus esse apparuerit,</HI> &amp;c. 'tis neither required nor supposed that our <HI>Iudgement</HI> should be <HI>Infalli|ble</HI>; It justifieth the <HI>Satute,</HI> that twas <HI>our Iudgement; aequum, an iniquum,</HI> it mat|ters not, 'tis <HI>ex decreto Fundatoris,</HI> a very <HI>statutable sentence,</HI> of which the party grie|ved cannot pardonably <HI>complain</HI> (much less <HI>from</HI> it can he <HI>Appeal</HI>) unless he can prove that our <HI>sentence</HI> was <HI>against</HI> our <HI>own Iudgement.</HI> For whether that Judgement were <HI>true</HI> or <HI>false,</HI> It is abundantly enough, that it was <HI>Sincere.</HI> This is said only to prove, that our <HI>Sentence</HI> had been <HI>just,</HI> (that is, according to the statute,) although our <HI>Iudgements</HI> had been <HI>erroneous.</HI> But that our <HI>Iudgements</HI> were <HI>not erroneous,</HI> and that our <HI>sentence</HI> was <HI>Milder</HI> than for the <HI>grievousness</HI> of the <HI>offence,</HI> our Visitor did declare at a <HI>publick hearing,</HI> and (since that) by a <HI>publick instrument</HI> under his Lp's own <HI>hand</HI> and <HI>Episcopal seal</HI>; And Dr. <HI>Yerburie</HI> himself hath <HI>confest</HI> in <HI>writing,</HI> as is to be seen in the College <HI>Register.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. 3. Now having proved from the <HI>Statutes</HI> and the <HI>Oath</HI> above written,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the power of the <HI>Visitor</HI> is <HI>cir|cumscribed</HI> in the <HI>statutes.</HI></NOTE> that no Fellow of our College can <HI>appeal</HI> to the Visitor in such a case, without committing the crime of <HI>Perjury,</HI> (which without <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Cap.</HI> 27. <HI>p.</HI> 66.</NOTE> all <HI>Remedy</HI> or * <HI>Delay</HI> is to be punished with <HI>expulsion,</HI> as shall be shew'd,) we shall proceed to give an Accompt of the <HI>Vse</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> of the Visitor, as the Founder hath prescribed in the conclusion of his Statutes. Where first it being said what he <HI>is not</HI> to do, 'tis presently added what he <HI>is.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg"><HI>Et si aliqua nova statuta per aliquem successorum nostrorum Episcop.

<P>It being said what he is <HI>not,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">About what it is proper to be conver|sant.</NOTE> it presently follows in the Statute what he properly <HI>is</HI> to do. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Cap 54. p. 131.</NOTE> <Q><HI>Si tamen de &amp; super aliquo articulo nostrorum Statutorum inter Praesi|dentem &amp; Socios aut aliquas personas nostri Collegii dubium aliquod seu discors opinio oriatur, cujus decisio, sanus &amp; planus intellectus intra Quindenam &agrave; tempore Emer|gentis Dubii conputandam nequiverit haberi, tunc volumus, qu&ograve;d Praesidens nostri Col|legii, qu&agrave;m citi&ugrave;s poterit, Dominum Episcopum Wintoniensem pro tempore existentem, in quo sinceram fiduciam ponimus, consulat; cujus quidem determinationi, interpretationi, Declarationi, super praedicto dubio faciendae, volumus Praesidentem, Socios, &amp; quascun&abque; personas nostri Collegii obtemperare, &amp; cum effectu parere,</HI> &amp;c.</Q> After which he goes on to say, that the Visitor is to expound the controverted Statute <HI>Secundum grammati|calem &amp; literalem sensum &amp; intellectum,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>&sect;. 4 Now 'tis obvious to observe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What obser|vables arise from the sta|tute last men|tioned.</NOTE> <HI>first</HI> that here is no mention of any possible <HI>Ap|peal</HI> to be made by provoked and punished Malefactors, from the President &amp; Officers by whom the punishment is inflicted, <HI>without the least discord,</HI> or <HI>doubting,</HI> about the <HI>sense</HI> of the <HI>Statute,</HI> by vertue of which it is inflicted. Nor did the Criminal himself ever pretend any such thing. <HI>Secondly,</HI> we observe, <HI>that when a doubt of the sense of any Statute</HI> does arise, the <HI>President</HI> must <HI>Appeal,</HI> and <HI>none but he. (Thirdly.)</HI> Nor must <HI>He</HI> do it neither, untill together with the <HI>Officers,</HI> he has <HI>debated</HI> the matter for 15. <HI>dayes.</HI> So careful was the Founder that the <HI>Visitor</HI> might not be <HI>troubled,</HI> but in a case of meer necessity; whereas if the <HI>Visitor</HI> will admit of an <HI>Appeal</HI> from every person, who shall <HI>repine</HI> at his <HI>punishment</HI> (though exceedingly less then his <HI>crimes de|serve,</HI>) neither the Visitor, nor the President, no nor the College where he presides, shall ever enjoy either peace or honour. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> we observe from our College Registers, that ever since the Foundation, (somewhat more than 200 years,) though frequently the Fellows have been put out of Commons, <HI>propter verba tant&ugrave;m indecora,</HI> and frequently <HI>expell'd</HI> for their <HI>Rebellions,</HI> to the President's order and command, (<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">E.G. Cap. 6.28. &amp; cap. 14. p. 40.</NOTE> Rebellion is often the Founders own word,) yet there never was an example of <HI>any Fellow or other person</HI> who <HI>appeal'd</HI> unto the <HI>Visitor</HI> or to any other <HI>power,</HI> upon pretence of an <HI>unjust</HI> or a <HI>rigorous Sentence.</HI> Mr <HI>Searle</HI> and Dr. <HI>Yerbury</HI> are the <HI>two first</HI> persons who durst attempt it.</P>

As <HI>first,</HI> when due corrections and Reformations are obstructed, by the multitude or potency of the <HI>Offenders themselves,</HI> or their <HI>Abettors.</HI> Here the <HI>President</HI> by his Oath is bound to complain unto the <HI>Visitor,</HI> giving up to <HI>Him</HI> the Offenders names. <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Vid stat. de jurament.

Next, a <HI>submission</HI> is at once too general and equi|vocal a word, and comes not home to the <HI>Visitor</HI>'s <HI>instrument,</HI> which requires <HI>Confes|sion</HI><MILESTONE N="I"> <HI>and Recantation. Thirdly,</HI> the recital of what was said to be yesterday <HI>deficient,</HI><MILESTONE N="II"> is it self <HI>deficient,</HI> and very <HI>fraudulent.</HI> For besides the <HI>two particulars</HI> which are here <MILESTONE N="III"> recited, he was yesterday told of his being obliged <HI>to confess, that his Appeal was null, unjust, and made up of things false, unjust, and illegal.</HI> Nor only so, <HI>but also in writing to recant and retract his</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Eadem ver|ba,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>very words, which he impru|dently had vented both against Dr.</HI> Clerk, <HI>and against the Statutes</HI>; which although the chief things exacted from him, he neither <HI>then</HI> did, nor doth he <HI>now</HI> take notice of. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> the two particulars which he recites of what he yesterday omitted, are very <MILESTONE N="IV"> falsely recited in several respects. For according to the <HI>instrument</HI> his confession was to be this, [<HI>That it was well, and justly, and legally decreed by the President and the Deans,</HI> when he was put out of Commons for fifteen days;] The <HI>first</HI> and <HI>third</HI> of which <HI>ad|verbs</HI> he wholly leaves out, and turns the <HI>second</HI> into an <HI>Adjective</HI>; betwixt which two there is a great and important difference; because a <HI>sentence</HI> may be just, which yet (in many respects) may be unjustly and illegally pronounced. Again, according to the <HI>instrument,</HI> wherein the words are, <HI>poenam ei inflictam fuisse favorabiliorem qu&agrave;m pro delicti gravitate,</HI> he should have confessed in the English, that his punishment was more favourable than for the <HI>Grievousness</HI> of his offence: whereas he falsely translates it thus, (as well in mockerie to the <HI>instrument,</HI> as against <HI>common sense,</HI>) that the pu|nishment was more favourable then the <HI>weight</HI> of his offence: as if <HI>gravitas</HI> in That place had signified <HI>weight</HI>; and that the <HI>weight</HI> of the offence had been <HI>favourable too</HI>; or that the <HI>punishment</HI> was but <HI>more favourable, than That which was not so at all.</HI> For which, and divers other reasons, (especially that the <HI>Visitor</HI> might not be mock't and derided, under pretense of his being <HI>obey'd</HI>) the <HI>President</HI> insisted on what he frequent|ly had injoyn'd, to wit, that Dr. <HI>Yerbury should shew the impartiality of his obedience to the Visitors Order &amp; Decree, by varying no more from the words of the Instrument, wherein his Recantation and Confession are injoyn'd,</HI> than * by turning the <HI>third into the first per|son singular,</HI> and the <HI>Subjunctive mood into the Indicative:</HI> which he often and finally would not <HI>perform. Fifthly,</HI> he saith <HI>he doth now in express terms confess and acknow|ledge these particulars</HI>; whereas the Terms are not <HI>expressed in conjunction with his <MILESTONE N="V"> Confession;</HI> which if <HI>any,</HI> is but <HI>imply'd,</HI> as it stands in connexion with [<HI>express terms</HI>] and [these <HI>particulars.</HI>] <HI>Sixthly,</HI> he professeth to confess <HI>whatsoever else</HI> my Lord <MILESTONE N="VI"> our Visitor by his Instrument hath injoyn'd, in <HI>meerly indefinite</HI> and <HI>general Terms</HI>; neither naming the <HI>nullity, falseness, injustice,</HI> and <HI>illegallity</HI> of his <HI>Appeal,</HI> (which he was to confess in writing, and <HI>terms expresse,</HI>) nor so much as <HI>Comprehending or Im|plying</HI>
