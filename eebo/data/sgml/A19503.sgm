<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE LORD, my Lord of <HI>Binning:</HI> President of the Colledge of IVSTICE; <HI>Secretary to his Maiesty, and one</HI> of his Highnesse most Honora|ble Priuy Councell in both <HI>the Kingdomes.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THIS Prophesie was properly co~|pared by <HI>Prima|sius,</HI> to a precious Gemme, or Ori|entall Pearle, not found in the clifts of rockes, or shels of fishes but sent from Heauen for a Present to the Church on Earth, by <HI>Iesus</HI>
<PB REF="3">
<HI>the splendor of the glory of his Father, and</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. Hebr. 1. 3. Luk. 1. 78. <GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> <HI>that bright Orient, which hath visited vs from on high.</HI> He giueth it in a Loue-token to his Church, who for it gaue himselfe to the death. Doubtlesse it must bee some great Present, which is sent from so great a King, by the hand of that Seruant whom he lo|ued best in the world.</P>
<P>This Iewell hath come in the hands of many, who being strangers, not acquain|ted with <HI>Canaan,</HI> from which it came, haue out of wrong conception iudged it to bee adulterine. But all the Lords <HI>Lapidaries,</HI> who haue seene the precious stones, wher|with the walls of Heauenly Ierusalem are garnished, haue easily perceiued this to be from heauen also; yea, and among all the rest, most admirable, for it partakes with all these, both in color and vertue, and ser|ueth Saints, not for decoration onely, but declaration also of many secrets, which greatly concerne their state.</P>
<P>Of old, <HI>Vrim</HI> and <HI>Thummim</HI> were placed by God in that <HI>Pectorall</HI> of the high Priest, called by the Iewes, <HI>Hosen,</HI> by the Greekes
<PB REF="3">
<GAP DESC="foreign">: but what it was, or how by it God gaue answere to his people Israel, many Di|uines in that point are diuinators, speaking more out of coniecture, then certaine knowledge.</P>
<P><HI>Iosephus</HI> records, that these stones by<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioseph. Anti|quit. lib. 3. c. 12.</NOTE> change of their colour, gaue signification of things to fall out; eyther aduerse or pros|perous. <HI>Sigonius</HI> in his Treatise of the <HI>He|brewes</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sigon. de re|pub. Heb. lib. 5.</NOTE> <HI>Republick,</HI> seemes to haue followed him. The report that <HI>Suidas</HI> brings from an vncertaine Author, is as vncertaine as the Author, that if battell was imminent, the stones turned red; if death was fore|told, they turned black; if no change of e|state was to ensue, then the stones chan|ged not their colour at all. One thing is sure, God by them gaue answere to his ser|uants that sought him, as may bee cleared by many places of Scripture.</P>
<P>But of this booke wee may boldly af|firme, that it is indeed a heauenly <HI>Oracle,</HI> foretelling in types, the truth of things, as they were to fall out to the worlds end: at the first it sheweth a white colour, impor|ting
<PB REF="4">
comfortable grace by the Gospell now, and immortall glory hereafter. In|continent it turneth to a red colour, fore|shewing bloudy persecutions which Saints must suffer, before they enioy the Crown. Then againe it appeareth with a blacke co|lour, to declare that blackenesse of wrath temporall and eternall, which abideth the enemies of the Church.</P>
<P>In some parts it looketh darke, in others, cleare like the Christall, yet through all, more or lesse transparent, and therewith variable with sundry sheddes, among which most apparant are three seuerall rankes of <HI>Seuens,</HI> stretching themselues in most comely order through this Iewell, and wherein the Lord hath secretly inclo|sed treasures of manifold wisedome. In the <HI>Seales</HI> vnsealed, secrets are disclosed: In the Trumpets, battels are denounced: In the <HI>Uials,</HI> plagues are powred out. The pur|pose in these three is not one, yet by a comely proportion and correspondence, doe they answere one to another.</P>
<P>Many haue handled this Iewell, not to
<PB REF="4">
finde it by their labour, (that were impos|sible) but to finde themselues by the va|lew of it. For that cause among others, I haue also looked vpon it, truely for none other end, but that I might learne from it; and now what I haue seene, I shew, sub|mitting my selfe to the Church, for whose profit I haue taken these paines. If the light of the booke hereby be any way en|creased, and comfort arise to the good Christian, the praise is the Lords, and vn|der God thankes is due to your Lordship; for by your louing counsell &amp; care, I haue beene relieued of many intricate matters of Law, and found the greater leysure and li|berty both, to attend my studies. Thus hath your Lordship beene a <HI>Mecaenas</HI> to me indeed. Good men oftentimes are for|ced to expresse great affections by small meanes, and so now it fareth with me; yet I trust your Lordship will esteeme of mee, not as I am, but as I desire to be on your behalfe.</P>
<P>But it is no reason I should requite deeds with words. I know, your Lordship doth
<PB REF="5">
neyther like them, nor need them. Where Vertue giueth out her beames, euen her e|nemies are forced to acknowledge her glory: yet thus much out of duty must I speake, that by many <HI>Coards</HI> of loue hath your God bound you to be thankefull to him. Vertue is weake without some ad|uersity, neither can that felicity bee found on earth, that communicates not with some crosse. Some are raised to wealth, but the lesse regarded by reason of their base Linage: Some, Noble by parentage, but depressed with pouerty: many beautified both with Nobility and riches, who want the delight of children; others haue the comfort of children, but with the turning of a few yeares, they turne crosses vnto them; there is no estate so prosperous, a|gainst which there is not iust cause of com|plaint: Thus runneth the common cur|rant of worldly courses here on earth.</P>
<P>But will your Lordship turne your eyes a little from others, and looke to your selfe; you shall see what cause your Lord|ship hath aboue others to say with <HI>Dauid,</HI>
<PB REF="5">
<HI>Many wayes hath the Lord beene beneficiall to his Seruant,</HI> beeing for Linage descen|ded of a wise, and worthy Father, of an Honourable Family, famous among ma|ny others of that most flourishing <HI>Trybe of Hammilton;</HI> Honourable also for the places of honour which you possesse, but much more for the vertue whereby you haue worthily deserued them; for it is a greater thing to deserue Honour, then to haue it, but where by Vertue it is obtai|ned, by Wisedome encreased, and by good Gouernement reteined, (all which are eui|dent in your Lordship:) What can be more? Your children (thankes be to God) no cros|ses, but comforts, like <HI>branches of the Oliue,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalm. 127. 3.</NOTE> promised to such as feare God, they stretch out themselues from the sides of your Ta|bie, and without disparagement, are mat|ched with the mighty Cedars of the Land.</P>
<P>For your selfe I haue nothing to say, but that which I know, no man can gaine-say: If quickenesse of ingine, vigour of ready witte, wisedome in words, discretion in deedes, secrecie in thoughts beseeming a
<PB REF="6">
<HI>Secretary,</HI> fidelity in seruice of your <HI>Soue|raigne;</HI> surety in friendship, modesty in all your behauiour: If education of your children in true Religion: If good exam|ple in the obseruance of God his publike worship euery Sabboth: If indefatigable paines in your Calling, for the good of the publique State, wherein nothing can bee seene all the dayes of the weeke, but <HI>Ca|tenati labores mutandi semper grauioribus;</HI> so that iustly it may bee admired how in so weake a body, such restlesse labor of mind may be sustained. If all these (I say) may commend any man, then hath your Lordshippe witnesses enow to speake for you, and needes not the testimony of o|thers.</P>
<P>Loe now, what a heape of good things hath the Lord multiplied vpon you! what remaines, but that you consider with <HI>Dauid, What shall I render to the Lord for</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalm. 116. 12.</NOTE> <HI>all his benefites towards mee?</HI> Hee him|selfe will giue you the answere; <HI>My well-doing extends not to the Lord, but</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalm. 16.</NOTE> <HI>to the Saints that are in the earth, and</HI>
<PB REF="6">
<HI>to the Excellent, all my delight is in them.</HI></P>
<P>Great cause had <HI>Dauid</HI> to loue <HI>Ionathan,</HI> hee could not get himselfe to requite his kindnesse, but hee enquired if any man were left of the house of <HI>Saul,</HI> that hee might shew him mercy for <HI>Ionathans</HI> sake:<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Sam. 9. 1. 2.</NOTE> and when hee vnderstood that hee had a weake sonne, <HI>Mephibosheth,</HI> lame of both his feete, he despised him not for his inabi|lity, but aduanced him for <HI>Ionathans</HI> sake,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vers. 11. 13.</NOTE> to eat at his owne table, as one of the Kings sonnes.</P>
<P>My Lord; our <HI>Ionathan</HI> is the Lord <HI>Iesus:</HI> wee haue not himselfe, but for his sake wee are bound to shew mercy to his <HI>Mephibosheths;</HI> these are the Leuites, the Widdow, the Fatherlesse, the Poore, the Stranger, and the Oppressed. Let not the Leuite want the comfort of the Law in his righteous cause: Look with a tender eye to the vpright action of weake and impotent men; God is a righteous Iudge to all men, but he hath taken these aboue others, vnder his singular protection. Thinke it your
<PB REF="7">
honour and happinesse also to be a Prote|ctor of them. So shall your Lordship pros|per still, and God shall stablish bles|sings vpon you, and your posteri|ty. I will pray to God for it, and so rest.</P>

<Q>Mine Helpe is in the Name of the LORD.</Q>
<P>_THE whole bookes of holy<NOTE PLACE="marg">The bookes of holy Scripture are of three rankes, ren|dring a three|fold fruit.</NOTE> Scripture are of three rankes, <HI>Historicall, Doctrinall, Prophe|ticall,</HI> they being so denomi|nate from the principall mat|ter in them contained. Of all these coniunctly, arises vnto vs, a three-fold fruite: the first, of <HI>Conuersion,</HI> the<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Of Conuersi|on.</NOTE> second, of <HI>Consolation,</HI> the third, of <HI>Confirmation.</HI> The first, once for all, is touched by the Psalmist: <HI>The Law of the Lord is perfect, conuerting the soule.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 19. 7.</NOTE> The second, by the Apostle; <HI>Whatsoeuer things</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 15. 4.</NOTE>
<PB N="2" REF="9">
<HI>are written, are written for our learning, that wee through patience, and comfort of the Scriptures might haue hope.</HI> It is true indeed, <HI>Many are the troubles</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Of Consolati|on.</NOTE> <HI>of the righteous,</HI> yet against euery crosse, the Lord hath giuen vs in his Word, sufficient consolation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 34. 19.</NOTE> The third is set downe by our Sauiour; <HI>These</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">3 Of Confirma|tion.</NOTE> <HI>things haue I said vnto you, that yee should not bee offended, that when the houre shall come, yee might</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 16. 4.</NOTE> <HI>remember that I told you of them.</HI> And this fruite of confirmation, wee haue especially by bookes Propheticall.</P>
<P>Of this nature is this booke, as is cleere by the<NOTE PLACE="marg">This booke of the Reuelation is Prophetical&punc;</NOTE> titles giuen vnto it, for in the first verse of the first Chapter, it is called an <HI>Apocalypse</HI> or <HI>Reuelation,</HI> that is, an opening, or vncouering of things, which were hid, and secret before: and in the fourth verse it is called <HI>A Prophecie:</HI> Thus haue we it not one|ly a Prophecie, or prediction of things to come, but a prophecie reuealed, and expounded, partly by Christ, and partly by the Angell.</P>
<P>And this is to be noted, that where other books<NOTE PLACE="marg">And it serues especially to confirme vs in the faith.</NOTE> of holy Scripture are written to instruct vs in the faith, and to teach vs, what wee must doe, if wee would be saued; this booke is written, not so much to instruct vs in the faith (though in part it doe that also) as to confirme vs in it, that for no vio|lent persecution following it, for no fraudulent he|resie by deceit impugning it, for no externall change befalling the Church, for no prosperous preuailing of the enemies thereof (as for a time will appeare to the world) we should forsake that
<PB N="3" REF="9">
faith, which the Lord Iesus, and his Apostles haue taught vs in the Gospell.</P>
<P>The Author of it, is God the Father, from him<NOTE PLACE="marg">This book the Father giues to the Son, the Son to an An|gel, and the Angel to Saint <HI>Iohn,</HI> that hee might giue it to the Church&punc;</NOTE> it commeth by this order: the <HI>Father</HI> giues it to the <HI>Sonne,</HI> the <HI>Sonne</HI> to an <HI>Angell,</HI> the <HI>Angell</HI> gi|ueth it to S. <HI>Iohn,</HI> and S. <HI>Iohn</HI> sends it to the <HI>Church.</HI> The matter whereof it entreates, is comprised in this short summe: <HI>In it God sheweth to his ser|uants things, which must shortly be done,</HI> namely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reuel. 1. 1.</NOTE> concerning the Church, her persecutions by ene|mies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The generall matter of this Prophecie.</NOTE> the changes and mutations of the visible state thereof, defections of Apostates, illusions of Heretikes, fearefull eclypses of the light of the Gospell: All these were to fall out <HI>in that houre of tentation to come vpon all the world, for</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reu. 3. 10.</NOTE> <HI>tryall of them that dwell vpon the earth.</HI> And in this Prophecie are distinctly fore-told by the Lord, that his Saints and seruants in all ages might be confirmed against them, when they should see them come to passe, knowing that they fall not out by accident, nor by the will or power of man, but according to the determinate counsell of God, who hath also letten his Church see before|hand a comfortable out-gate, and end of them all.</P>
<P>And as both for the Matter, and Authour, this<NOTE PLACE="marg">The time whe~ this book was written, com|mends it great|ly to vs.</NOTE> booke should bee welcome to vs, so the circum|stance of the time doth greatly commend it. It was sent vnto vs after the Ascension of our Lord, and is the last breath of the Spirit wherewith he inspired the Writers of holy Scripture. No Scrip|ture
<PB N="4" REF="10">
is to be expected after this. It is the last Loue|token of our Lord, and louing Husband, after which he will write no more vnto vs, but will come himselfe: he hath sent it to vs with the Disciple, whom he loued best, and who was the last, and longest liuer of all the Disciples.</P>
<P>Kinde children remember best the words<NOTE PLACE="marg">The last words of our Lord, should be best remembred.</NOTE> spoken by their fathers on their death-bed: and if it were possible that after death, they could re|ceiue any information from them, O, in what estimation would they haue it! All the words of our Lord should be laid vp in our hearts; but spe|cially these which hee vttered in the time of his death and Passion: and most of all, these, by which now after his Resurrection &amp; Ascension, he spea|keth vnto vs. There are many now a daies com|panions to the rich Glutton, and his brethren, they will not beleeue <HI>Moses</HI> and the Prophets, <HI>but</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 16. 31.</NOTE> <HI>if one came from the dead, then would they amend their liues.</HI> This is a Prouerbe frequent in their<NOTE PLACE="marg">An answer to Atheists, who will haue one from the dead to teach them.</NOTE> mouthes: but now this excuse also is taken from them: Our Lord Iesus is risen from the dead, and after his resurrection witnesses vnto vs, what feare|full wrath is reserued for the wicked, what vnspeak|able ioy prepared for the godly; if for all this they will not beleeue, nor amend their liues, are they not worthy of the greater condemnation?<NOTE PLACE="marg">About three|score yeeres after his ascen|sion, our Lord sent this Reue|lation.</NOTE></P>

<P>The other scandall of obscuritie is easily re|moued,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 By pretending the obscurity of it.</NOTE> if the exposition of the prophecie runne not before the execution thereof. It was hard to

the Fathers of the first ages to vnderstand this booke so cleerely, as now by Gods grace, his seruants may.

Hee intitulates his booke <HI>Apoca|lypsis Apocalypseos,</HI> that is, <HI>The Reuelation of the Reuelation:</HI> a stately stile, promising much, which would to God he had performed: but in very truth, the right name of it is <GAP DESC="foreign">, that is, the obscuration of the <HI>Reuelation.</HI> Types properly belonging to Christ, are accommodate to men. Who can patiently heare this, that the <HI>Angel,</HI> hauing the seale of the liuing God, is <HI>Con|stantine</HI> the Great? Or that the <HI>Angel,</HI> who offers vp the prayers of all Saints, is <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great? This is, as it seemes, to put violent hands in the booke, and force it to follow the phantasie of man, as hereafter by this, and many other more, shall bee, God willing, at greater length declared.

<P><HI>Ioannes Auentrotus,</HI> a Gentleman, as it seemes<NOTE PLACE="marg">37 Printed yeere 1615.</NOTE> of good credit, hath some discourses vpon this Prophecie, by way of an Epistle sent to the King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> and presented, as he writes, by the Duke of <HI>Lerma,</HI> and graciously receiued of the King: hee seemes to restraine it somewhat strictly to the <HI>Belgic</HI> Battell, the blame whereof hee casts on the Pope, not sparing to affirme, that these wars shall hasten the end of Antichrist his grandeur. Hee witnesseth of himselfe, that hee liued a long time in the <HI>Canarie</HI> Iles, plunged in the puddle of Papistry: at length by reading the Councell of <HI>Trent,</HI> and conferring it with holy Scripture, he found a direct discordance of the one from the other, and thereupon resolued to transport his house into the Low Countries. By the way hee
<PB N="26" REF="21">
visited the Court of <HI>Spaine,</HI> where he spared not to communicate his minde to the Duke of <HI>Lerma,</HI> and <HI>Andreas de Prada,</HI> the Kings Secretarie, not onely concerning matters pertaining to State, but Religion also; these concerning Religion, the Duke of <HI>Lerma</HI> willed him to communicate by himselfe to the King: the King for that cause ap|pointed <HI>Andreas de Prada</HI> to conferre with him for his better information. As the Authour re|ports, this Secretaric was a man who feared God, loued truth, and was not far from the knowledge thereof. In the conference hee was twice moued to confesse, By your Arguments, saith he, it is not impossible but that the Pope must be Antichrist; yet did he counsell him rather to write his minde in his owne Countrey, then there: whereupon the Authour went forward in his iourney, and hauing accomplished it, he writes from <HI>England,</HI> in the yeere 1610. <HI>Octob.</HI> 12. another pithic Epistle against the Kingdome of Antichrist, which as he saith, the fore-said Secretary, according to his promise, presented to the King of <HI>Spaine.</HI> In it he boldly affirmes, <HI>Romanam Religionem falsam esso doctrinam, Papam Antichristum, &amp; Bellum Belgi|cum regni Antichristi sinem suturum esse.</HI> In this last point onely, as I said, he seemeth too strictly to restraine this Prophecie.

<DIV2 TYPE="cautions">
<HEAD>Two Necessarie Cautions, or Caueats, to bee considered in the exposition of this Booke.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="caution">
<HEAD>The first Caution.</HEAD>
<P>VVEE must beware of two extremities in<NOTE PLACE="marg">That the Pro|phecie be not limited to par|ticular persons and times.</NOTE> the handling of this Prophecie; first, that we limit not these Visions so particularly vnto times, and persons, as many doe; whereby they haue greatly empaired the Maiestie, and Ampli|tude of this <HI>Reuelation.</HI> For example, one among many, is the first Seale, which sheweth our Lord<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first Seale by some re|strained, for time, too nar|rowly.</NOTE> riding on his white Horse, like a Conquerour, no larger, in respect of time, then from the Baptisme of <HI>Christ,</HI> to the destruction of <HI>Ierusalem.</HI> I know,
<PB N="30" REF="23">
<HI>Forthaeus,</HI> and others, extend it larger, and will haue it reach from the daies of <HI>Christ,</HI> to the daies of <HI>Constantine;</HI> but this also is too narrow counting: The Church should be depriued of great com|fort, if the <HI>Conquerour,</HI> riding on the white horse, were pinched, and bounded within so short a time. But the certaine truth is, <HI>Our Lord Iesus</HI> mounted, by the opening of the first Seale, vpon his white horse, shall so continue riding through the world at his owne pleasure, till he haue gathe|red in his Saints, till hee <HI>Ouercome,</HI> and make his enemies his foote-stoole.</P>
<P>This will be manifest, if we compare the end<NOTE PLACE="marg">The time of the first Seale continues to the worlds end.</NOTE> of this Prophecie with the beginning thereof. In the entry of this Prophecie, at the opening of the first Seale, <HI>The Rider on the white Horse</HI> appeares: in the end of it, there he appeares againe; <HI>I saw</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reu. 19. 11, 12, 13.</NOTE> <HI>heauen opened, and behold, a white Horse, and hee that sate vpon him, was called Faithfull, and True, and in righteousnesse hee doth iudge, and make warre, &amp;c. Hee was clothed in a Vesture dipt in bloud, and his Name is called, The Word of God.</HI> All the time of the battell hee is not knowne vnder this Type: shall we therefore thinke he was not sighting, nor shooting his Arrowes? No, his Vesture in the se|cond apparition, is a witnesse of his victorie, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">As the Rider on the white, appeares in the begin|ning; so also in the end of the battell.</NOTE> slaughter of his enemies.</P>
<P>This might haue told them, that the Lord Ie|sus, who comes out in the first Seale, riding on a white horse, and of whom it is so expresly said, that <HI>Hee went forth conquering, that he might ouer|come;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reu. 6. 2.</NOTE>
<PB N="31" REF="23">
was to continue so, till hee had done the worke, for which hee commeth forth; that is, perfected his Saints, and subdued his enemies. Wee must not limit so short a time to so great a worke: they who do so, defraud the Church (as we haue said) of a great and ample comfort: For<NOTE PLACE="marg">The white Horse this same day is still riding a|mong vs.</NOTE> euen in our owne daies, and among our selues (blessed be his name for it) this Conquerour is ri|ding, and shall so continue to the worlds end; yet the time of the first Seale lasteth, as also of the subsequent Seales following it, which shall (God willing) hereafter be declared, that the Seales openeth vp the generall course of things, till the day of Iudgement; and within narrower bounds should they not be restrained.</P>
<P>What shall I speake of other grosser interpre|tations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How this Pro|phecie by some, in ridi|culous maner, is restrained to particular persons.</NOTE> whereunto many are driuen, by binding this Prophecie to particular persons. Can the foure Beasts be foure Euangelists? Then S. <HI>Iohn</HI> behooued to be one of the foure, or else yee must make them fiue Euangelists; for euery one of the foure prepareth him. Or shall the first Beast bee <HI>Quadratus?</HI> Shall the second be <HI>Iustinus? &amp;c.</HI> Shall the Angell comming from the East, who hath the Seale of the liuing God, be <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great? Or shall the Angell, that offers vp the prayers of all Saints, be <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great also? He was great indeed&punc; but this is to make him too great. Shall the Angell comming out of the Temple, be <HI>Thomas Cromwell,</HI> Lord of <HI>Essex?</HI> Or the Angell hauing power ouer the fire, be <HI>Thomas Cranmer?</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="24">
Or shall the type of the Haruest and Vintage bee appropriate to <HI>England?</HI> Why hath <HI>Brightman</HI> broached such opinions, without all hope, or help of verity?</P>
<P>I know, the persons whom he hath named, are<NOTE PLACE="marg">No reasonable men will ap|propriate to themselues, that which is common to the Church.</NOTE> famous and honourable; and that the Lord hath a flourishing Church in <HI>England,</HI> his name bee praised therefore: But I am assured, the reuerend Bishops, the learned Doctors, and Diuines there, will not vindicate that to themselues, which is common to the whole Church. It were tedious to repeat all of this sort, whereby common types are accomodate vnto priuate persons: which is not the fault of <HI>Brightman</HI> onely (though most part of them be forged in his owne braine) but of many others also.</P>
<P>And thus, as about the accommodation of<NOTE PLACE="marg">This Prophe|cie goeth not on, by one co~|tinuall course of time inter|rupted.</NOTE> publike Types, to priuate persons, they are mis|carried; so, in binding this Prophecie to one inter|rupted and continuall course of time, taking vp one chapter in time to be alway posterior to an|other, they haue greatly erred also. For the Re|uelation is not one Prophecie, but a Prophecie often repeated: So S. <HI>Augustine</HI> takes it vp, <HI>Sicea|dem</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. de Ciuit. Dei, ca. 20. lib. 17</NOTE> <HI>multis modis repetit Ioannes in Apocalypsi, vt alta, at&abque; alia dicere videatur, cum aliter, at&abque; aliter haec ipsa dicere inuestigetur:</HI> that in this Booke the same things are many waies repeated. And <HI>Primasius,</HI> if he was, as <HI>Trithemius</HI> records, dis|ciple to S. <HI>Augustine,</HI> seemes to haue learned it from him; Howeuer it bee, hee hath mostiudici|ously
<PB N="33" REF="24">
obserued, that S. <HI>Iohn, Totum tempus ecclesiae</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Primas in Apoc.</NOTE> <HI>diuersis figuris repetit enarrandum:</HI> the whole time and state of the Church is repeated here by Saint<NOTE PLACE="marg">But is a Pro|phecie sundry times, and sun|dry wares re|peated.</NOTE> <HI>Iohn</HI> vnder diuers Types and Figures. Wee will ioyne both these, that in this Prophecie we haue not onely <HI>alia at&abque; alta,</HI> but <HI>eadem aliter at&abque; aliter.</HI> Sundry times is the state of the Church here de|ducted from the daies of Christ, to the day of Iudgement; when one Prophecie is ended, ano|ther beginnes: one of them in order is after ano|ther, but all of them are of like length concerning time: For, as I haue said, euery one of them foretels the state of the Church from Christ his daies, till his second Comming.</P>
<P>This is a maine point most needfull to bee ob|serued<NOTE PLACE="marg">This is proued by the iudge|ment of Inter|preters con|trary minded.</NOTE> for the vnderstanding of this Booke: the neglect, or not obseruation of it, hath bred vnto many Writers inextricable difficulties; which may be tryed by this one Argument; that they, who go through this Prophecie by one continuall course of time, making alway the former chapter prior in time to the subsequent, when they come to the twelfth chapter, there they find themselues straited, they are forced there to interrupt their course, and to come back againe vnto the daies<NOTE PLACE="marg">When they come to the twelfth chap|ter, they are forced to be|gin againe.</NOTE> of Christ and state of the Church Primitiue. For, as I haue said, at the twelfth chapter beginnes a new Prophecie of the estate of the Church. Let the iudicious Reader consider their Commen|taries, and he shall see it to be as I haue said. The twelfth chapter beginneth as high, as the first
<PB N="34" REF="25">
Seale, their iudgement against it serues to con|firme mine, that the course of this Prophecy pro|ceeds not by time interrupted: as if one chapter contained the story of matters from such a yeere to such a yeere, and the next in like manner, as by some is particularly set downe.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="caution">
<HEAD>The second Caution.</HEAD>
<P>THe other extremetie to be eschewed is, that<NOTE PLACE="marg">These three Prophecies must not bee confounded into one, which some Writers do.</NOTE> we confound not these distinct Prophecies in|to one, to make the seuen Seales, the seuen Trum|pets, and the seuen Vials to be all one, as <HI>Collado,</HI> and some others do. It is true, they do all agree in this generall, that they declare the estate of the Church, God his working for it, and against his enemies, yet both for their matter, and manner, they are distinct Prophecies, and haue (as we haue said) <HI>alia at&abque; alia, &amp; eadem aliter at&abque; aliter:</HI> So that we are not to thinke that no other matter is in the first Trumpet, then was in the first Seale; or that no other thing is in the first Vial, then was in the first Trumpet, and first Seale, as shall now, God willing, be made more plaine.</P>

<HEAD>The Method of this Booke, as it is taken vp by the Authour.</HEAD>
<P>TO shew then the naturall method of this Book,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This book is a Prophecie of things which are, and are to come.</NOTE> that is, a method not inforced vpon it, but plainely laid open, and giuen vnto vs by the Pro|phecie it selfe: We passe by the first part, contai|ning a generall Preface of the whole Book, in the first three verses of the first chapter, and the last part containing the Conclusion of the book, from the sixt verse of the last chapter, to the end. The body of the Booke it selfe containes a Prophecie, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>of things which are,</HI> (to wit, when this Prophecie was giuen) <HI>and of things which are to come.</HI> This generall method is laid downe by the Lord himselfe, <HI>Write,</HI> saith hee, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>things which are, and the</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reu. 1. 19.</NOTE> <HI>things which shall be hereafter.</HI></P>
<P>Let not this be thought strange; for there is<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prophecie in Generall is not onely of things to come, but of things, both past, and pre|sent.</NOTE> not onely a Prophecie of things to come, as was that Prophecie of <HI>Esay, Daniel,</HI> and others, in which sense the word of Prophecie is co~monly taken: but there is a Prophecie also of things past: such was that Prophecie of <HI>Moses,</HI> whereby hee plainely<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 1.</NOTE> shewed forth the creation of the world, which was done about two thousand, three hundred, and se|uenty three yeeres before that himselfe came into the world: and there is in like manner a prophe|cie of things present, as that, by which <HI>Ahiiah</HI> the<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. King. 14. 6.</NOTE> <HI>Silonite</HI> discouered the wife of <HI>Ieroboam</HI> disguised;
<PB N="36" REF="26">

King. 5. 27.</NOTE> and saw him take the bribe from <HI>Naaman</HI> the <HI>Syrian.</HI> Of this sort, is this first prophecie of Saint<NOTE PLACE="marg">In the first three chap|ters, is a Pro|phecie of things pre|sent, when S. <HI>Iohn</HI> liued.</NOTE> <HI>Iohn,</HI> contained in the first three chapters of this Booke; for in it, the present estate of the Church, as it was in the daies of Saint <HI>Iohn,</HI> is laid open, not as it seemed to be, but as it was in very deed; for some of them, who had a name that they were liuing, are declared by this prophecie to be dead, as the Church of <HI>Sardis.</HI> But we are to remember that this prophecie is in such sort written for the Church at that time, that it serues also for all other Churches to the worlds end. And this pro|phecie hath before it a conuenient vision of pre|paration, from the ninth verse of the first chap|ter to the end; and then after the preparatorie Vision, followes the prophecie it selfe, contained in the second and third chapters. This for the first Prophecie of this Booke, which is, <HI>Of things that are.</HI></P>
<P>The other Prophecie, of things <HI>which are to</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prophe|cie of things to come, is fro~ the fourth chapter, to the sixt verse of the last.</NOTE> <HI>come,</HI> continues from the fourth chapter vnto the sixth verse of the last chapter: and this Prophe|cie hath, first, a Vision of Preparation; secondly, Visions of Prediction. The Vision of Prepara|tion is in the fourth and fifth chapter: For, this we lay for a ground, that these two chapters con|taine no Vision of Prediction, but onely of Pre|paration; for prediction is not made before the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Before it there is a Prepara|torie Vision, chapter 4. &amp; 5.</NOTE> opening of the Seales. This method, yee see, maketh it selfe, as the first Prophecie, <HI>Of things</HI>

<HI>which are,</HI> had a conuenient Preparatorie Vision going before it: so this second, and great Pro|phecie, <HI>of things which are to come,</HI> hath a Prepa|ratory Vision preceding it, very fit, and conueni|ent for the subsequent predictions, as (God wil|ling) we shall shew when we enter to the fourth chapter.</P>
<P>This second Prophecie then <HI>of things which</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">After, it begins the Visions of Prediction at the sixth chap|ter.</NOTE> <HI>are to come,</HI> beginnes at the sixt chapter, and it is two-fold: first, a prophecie of the estate of the Church Militant to the worlds end, and this continues to the one and twentieth chapter. The other is a prophecie of the victorie, glory, and eternall felicity of the Church Triumphant, in the one and twentieth, and beginning of the two and twentieth chapters. In this, all the Interpreters agree, and make no question; except that some will haue the fourth and fifth chapters to containe Visions of Prediction, as well as the rest, which (as we haue said) cannot be; for, the opening of the Seales, out of which comes the discouery of things to come, beginneth at the sixt chapter.</P>
<P>Now to take vp rightly the Method of the Pro|phecy<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Visions of Prediction are three, the state of the Church being foretold three times.</NOTE> of the estate of the Church Militant, let vs keepe in minde that ground laid by S. <HI>Augustine</HI> and <HI>Primasius,</HI> that it is, <HI>Prophetia saepius repetita,</HI> not one continuall Prophecie, but a Prophecie repeated; and that, not doubled onely, as was the dreame of <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> to shew the certainety of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 41. 32.</NOTE> Vision, but tripled; all the three Visions fore|telling the estate of the Church in a different
<PB N="38" REF="27">

<P>THe first Prophecie in effect is a generall Prog|nostication, proposing a short, and summa|ry view of the state of the Church, specially vnder violent persecution, to the worlds end, which is this. In the first Seale is declared how Christ<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 That Christ wil go through the world with his Gospell.</NOTE> shall go through the world, riding vpon the Mi|nisterie of the Word, preaching the Gospell by his seruants, where, and when it pleaseth him.

Yet are we told in the third and fourth Seale, that they shall not escape vnpunished; for thereupon followes the blacke and the pale Horse, with their Riders;
<PB N="40" REF="28">
figuring famine, pestilence, and other horrible plagues of God, that shall come on the world for contempt of the Gospell. And because the sword, famine, pestilence, do not so go through the world, that the godly are exempted from them: In the fifth Seale, the estate of Saints<NOTE PLACE="marg">4 But will secure his Saints fro~ wrath to come.</NOTE> troubled on earth, for the testimony of Iesus, is set downe in most comfortable manner: and then, as they tryed in the fifth Seale, for the day of re|uenge<NOTE PLACE="marg">5 In which, at last, the wic|ked shal perish desperately.</NOTE> and iudgement; so, at the opening of the sixt Seale, the horrible day of Doome appeareth to the terrour of the wicked.</P>
<P>We are not then to binde any of these Seales,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Seale, ex|cept the sixt, should bee re|strained to a particular time.</NOTE> except the sixt, to a determinate time, but take them vp as extended to all times, during the worlds endurance: Farre lesse, to expound these Riders on the Horses of Roman Emperours, &amp; o|ther particular persons, as we haue shewed before.</P>
<P>In this first Prophecie there is no difficultie, ex|cept<NOTE PLACE="marg">In this Me|thod, no diffi|culty is, but a|bout the sixth Seale:</NOTE> about the sixt seale, whether or not it doth fore-shew the day of Iudgement, and about the seuenth chapter, how it followeth and dependeth on the sixt, and how it is a pendicle of the first Prophecie. Concerning the first, we hold thus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which some will haue to be a Prophecie of Apostacie: o|thers, of a te~|porall iudge|ment: but nei|ther can be.</NOTE> that the sixt seale containes a propheticall predic|tion of the last Day. Against this, there are two opinions: Some thinke that it is a Prophecie of heresies, apostasies, and defections from the faith: Others, that it is a prophecy of some fearefull tem|porall iudgement; but neither of these are to bee receiued.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="28">The Text it selfe militats directly against the<NOTE PLACE="marg">That it is not a Prophecy of Apostasie, is proued out of the Text.</NOTE> first opinion, that the darkening of the Sunne and Moone, the falling of the Starres, admitteth not any Allegoricall interpretation of any darkenesse to come by Heresie, and Apostasie; for it is plain|ly said in the fifteenth verse, that Kings, Great Men, and Captaines, were afraid, when they saw the fearefull change of the creatures, they hid themselues in dennes: Shall we thinke here that it was Apostasie, and Heresie, obscuring the light of the Gospell, that made them to cry out, <HI>Moun|taines,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reu. 6. 16.</NOTE> <HI>fall vpon vs, and couer vs.</HI> No, so farre were they from all feare for that matter, that by the con|trarie they reioyced in it: Emperours, I meane great men, and Captaines, being themselues, chiefe Authors, Actors, and Allowers of these Heresies, which darkened the Sunne. Yea, it is very well knowne, that they, either by allurements, entised others, or by violence forced them to make Apostasie and Defection from the Truth.</P>
<P>Neither is it to be vnderstood, to bee a denun|tiation<NOTE PLACE="marg">A three-fold reason, pro|uing that the sixth Seale im|ports not a de|nunciation of iudgement temporall.</NOTE> of any temporall, or externall iudgement for these reasons: First, there is here an vniuersall change made of all creatures in heauen and in earth: Next, all the persons of the wicked, not of one Nation or Kingdome, but of all, are vniuer|sally here iudged, and that vnder seuen rankes: Thirdly, it is expresly called in the Text, <HI>The great Day of the Lord his wrath.</HI> The like stile, I know, is also giuen to daies of temporall iudgement; yet conioyne this with the rest of the Reasons, and

<P>Sith the seuen Vials are the seuen last plagues,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proued also by similitude of phrases vsed in the seuenth Viall, impor|ting the last Wrath.</NOTE> of force we must grant, that the last Viall powreth out the last wrath of that great Day, which con|cludeth all wrath in this life, and beginnes that endlesse wrath in the life to come. The warning premitted to the Viall, is the ordinary and ac|customed warning before the day of Iudgement, <HI>Behold, I come as a Thiefe:</HI> Beside that, the speech<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reu. 16. 15.</NOTE> there, is like vnto the speech heere, <HI>Euery Ile fled</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ver. 20.</NOTE> <HI>away, and the Mountaines were not found.</HI> But more cleerely in the twentieth chapter, where none will deny that hee speaketh of the day of Iudgement, where he saith; <HI>I saw one, from whose</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reu. 20. 11.</NOTE> <HI>face fled away both earth and heauen.</HI> The simili|tude of phrases vsed in all these places, sheweth, that this sixt seale also is to be vnderstood of the day of Iudgement.</P>

<HI>then shall all the Tribes of the earth mourne, and they shall see the Sonne of man comming in the cloudes of heauen with Power and great Glory, and hee shall send his Angels with the great sound of a Trumpet, and they shall gather together the Elect from the foure windes, from the one end of heauen to the other.</HI> These places, conferred one with ano|ther, let vs see, that the sixt seale is to be expoun|ded of the day of Iudgement. The most iudici|ous Interpreters are of this minde also, as (God willing) shall be declared, when we come to the opening vp of the Seales.</P>
<P>Now, as for the other difficultie, concerning<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the se|uenth chapter is a pendicle of the sixt.</NOTE> the seuenth chapter, we resolue it thus; that the seuenth chapter is a pendicle of the sixt, contai|ning <HI>per</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign"> a larger explication of the fifth and sixt Seales, which the iudicious Reader will easily perceiue. In the fifth Seale, Saints cry for iudgement on their enemies. The answer is giuen them, that they should <HI>rest for a little season, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ll their brethren were fulfilled.</HI> Incontinent in the sixt Seale, S. <HI>Iohn</HI> sees represented vnto him that terri|ble day of Iudgement for which Saints cryed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reu. 6. 11.</NOTE> The cause why, the Iudgement longed for by Saints, and seene by S. <HI>Iohn</HI> is delayed, is plaine, out of the seuenth chapter. For, in the beginning<NOTE PLACE="marg">Containing a larger expla|nation of the fift and sixt Seales.</NOTE> of that chapter he sees the Angels, executors of that last Iudgement, prepared, <HI>Standing at the foure windes,</HI> as <HI>S.

<PB N="44" REF="30">
it, but that they are commanded to stay till the seruants of God be gathered, and sealed, as was answered to the cry of Saints in the fifth Seale. This is the onely difficulty in the method of this first Prophecie, the like whereof occurres not in any of the rest; yet, let that be pondered without preiudice, which I haue said, and the matter shall be plaine. Needfull was it, that the Seale, shewing out the cry of slaine Martyrs, and the answer gi|uen them, should be explayned, by a more full de|claration of their felicity in heauen: and that the Tragicall end of the wicked in the sixt Seale, should haue set against it the Triumphant estate of the godly in heauen; all which, at length, is done, in the seuenth chapter, and therefore I count it a pendicle of the sixt.

<PB N="45" REF="30">
vpon earth, of battels which hee fore-saw com|ming against them, hee sends out his Heralds to blow the Trumpet, and sound the Alarum, that his Saints might be wakened, and armed to resist their enemies.

<P>This Prophecie I call more <HI>Speciall</HI> then the<NOTE PLACE="marg">It denounceth battell to the Church, by fraudulent he|retiques.</NOTE> former: The former hath fore-warned vs, espe|cially, of troubles by violent persecution, that shall follow the preaching and professing of the Gos|pell.

goeth vp as high, as the first Seale, yet containing a new Reuelation of another matter, then that which was fore-shewed in the Seales; to wit, as I said, the troubles which the Church was to suffer, euen to the darkening of her light, and obscuring of her visible face, by deceitfull heresies.</P>
<P>Where we are to obserue another thing, which<NOTE PLACE="marg">In the Trum|pets God comes not out in hostility a|gainst his ene|mies, but warnes his Church of e|nemies com|ming against her.</NOTE> hath in this point miscarried many learned Inter|preters. They haue conceited, that in the Tru~pets, the Lord commeth forth in hostility against the enemies of his Church, &amp; take these things soun|ded by the Trumpets, to be great euils, plagues, and punishments denounced to the world for contempt of the Gospell; whereas, in very deed, they point out the enemy comming in hostility, ranged in seuerall battels to fight against the Church. It is true, the Lord after this commeth out in open battell against his enemies, but not here in this place.</P>
<P>Marke it yet ouer againe (for these grounds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Tru~|pets and Vials differ.</NOTE> wherupon the Prophecy standeth, would be deep|pondered; if once we vnderstand them, the Pro|phecie will be the plainer.) The Trumpets and Vials differ this manner of way. In the Trum|pets, Satan by his Instruments, commeth out in arrayed battell against the Church: Lest they should annoy her by suddaine inuasion, or secret<NOTE PLACE="marg">In the one, wicked men fight against the Church, in the other, God fights against the wicked:</NOTE> ambushment, the <HI>Lord Iesus, Captaine</HI> of his peo|ple, warnes them by sound of Trumpet, of the enemy approaching; hee tels what troupes they are, what stratagems they vse, what armour they

fight with, that his Saints may be armed to resist them. In the Vials againe, the Lord commeth forth in araied battell against the enemies of his Church, rendring plagues proportionall to these sins, by which they impugned and corrupted true doctrine. This not being considered, hath moued many iudicious men to thinke, that for time and matter, the Trumpets and Vials are both one, but in truth they are not.</P>
<P>For cleering this matter once for all, let vs re|member,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And renders to them iudge|ment propor|tional to their sinnes.</NOTE> how in the most obscure Prophecies of this Booke, the Lord hath secretly laid downe a key, which if men can finde, they shall bee the more able by it to open the Prophecie.

It shall bee made plaine to him that reades without preiudice; compare eue|ry Trumpet with the correspondent Viall, and yee shall see, in the one, men impugning the Truth of God, and in the other, God plaguing them cor|respondently. In the Trumpets, Antichrist riseth<NOTE PLACE="marg">This will bee made plaine by comparing euery Trum|pet with the correspondent Viall.</NOTE> by degrees, till he come to his height; in the Vials, God casts him downe by degrees. To leaue the rest, and compare but one: In the fifth Trumpet, Antichrist following his fore-runners, commeth

forth like a fallen Starre, openeth the bottom|lesse pit, and bringeth out a smoake which darke|neth both the Sunne, and the Aire; that is, both the light of the Gospell, and glory of the Church: for which, the righteous Iudge, in the fifth Viall, powreth out wrath on the Kingdome of the <HI>Beast,</HI> and darkneth his Throne; the like throughout all, the attentiue Reader may obserue, comparing euery Trumpet with the correspondent Viall. Thus in the Trumpets and Vials, haue we seuerall Prophecies of seuerall times, and matters, yet stan|ding in a relation the one to the other; the prac|tices of the enemy against the Church being pointed out in the Trumpets, their punishments proportionall comming from God, expounded in the Vials.

All this preparation being made before, then in the sixe|teenth followes the execution; the Vials of Gods wrath, according to the tenour of his proclama|tion, are powred out vpon the Beast, and them that worship him. There, by degrees, a man may see the Kingdome of Antichrist to decay, as he grew by degrees. The seuenth Trumpet brings with it the consummation of all, and concludes the first Prophecie of Antichrist his destruction, fore-told vnder typicall and figuratiue speeches.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>VERSE. 1.</BIBL> After this I looked, and behold, a dore was opened in heauen, and the first Voice which I heard, was, as it were of a Trumpet talking with me, which said, Come vp hither, and I will shew thee things, which must be hereafter.</Q>

<P><HI>AFTER this.</HI>] This is to be referred to the<NOTE PLACE="marg">The time wherein Saint <HI>Iohn</HI> saw this Vision.</NOTE> order of the Visions, not to the interuall, or long distance of time; for all these Visions, S. <HI>Iohn</HI> saw them in one day: <HI>I was in the Spirit on</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reuel. 1.</NOTE> <HI>the Lords Day, and I heard behind me a great Voice:</HI> and yet, <HI>Quaelibet visio suam habuit morulam,</HI> eue|ry<NOTE PLACE="marg">Carthus.</NOTE> Vision had the owne space of time; by order, one after another, are they reuealed vnto him, yet so, that vpon one day, and in one trance he saw all; and this hee signifies in the entry.</P>
<P>As to the manner of his sight, what way S. <HI>Iohn</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A three-fold <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ight.</NOTE> saw these Visions, because frequent mention is
<PB N="61" REF="39">
made of it in this Prophecie, it is expedient, that once for all we speake of it. There is a three-fold<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Naturall, com|mon to the creature.</NOTE> sight: 1. Naturall, 2. Propheticall. 3. Spirituall. The Naturall sight is common both to good and euill; this is that sight we haue by the eye of God seene in his workes: <HI>For the inuisible things of God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 1. 10.</NOTE> <HI>that is his eternall Power and God-head, are seene, and vnderstood by the things he hath made.</HI></P>
<P>The second sight is Propheticall, yet common<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Supernaturall, or Propheti|call; this is made by reue|lation, repre|sentation, or both.</NOTE> also both to good and euill; I meane not to all, but some of euery one of them, for <HI>Balaam</HI> had it: this is a sight of things to come, made by Re|uelation, Representation, or both. A sight of things to come by Representation, was offered to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Numb. 24.</NOTE> <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> and to <HI>Nabuchadnezzar,</HI> but they wan|ted the reuelation of it; they could tell what they saw, but could not tell what it signified, till it was declared; to the one, by <HI>Ioseph;</HI> to the other by<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 41. Dan. 2.</NOTE> <HI>Daniel.</HI> Sometime againe, there is a sight of things to come shewed to the seruants of God by Reue|lation, without Representation: such a sight many of the Prophets had: But here, to Saint <HI>Iohn,</HI> things to come are shewed both the waies: first, by Repre|sentation, next by Reuelation. In the manner of his Vision, three things must be obserued, that it was, <HI>Interna, Imaginaria, Intellectualis:</HI> It was first,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Carthus.</NOTE> Internall, by the minde; for his bodily senses<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the sight which S <HI>Ioh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> saw, was Inter|nall, Imagina|ry, Intellectu|all.</NOTE> were now asleepe, his spirit, for a time, hauing after a sort, derelinquished his body: Next, it was Imaginary, for by types, similitudes, resemblan|ces, and figures of corporall, and materiall things,
<PB N="62" REF="40">
formed in his minde, were they represented to him. Thirdly, it was Intellectuall; for by heauen|ly illumination, S. <HI>Iohn</HI> was taught, and informed to vnderstand truely, what these Types, Simili|tudes and Figures did represent and signifie; otherwise hee had not beene a Prophet, nor able to shew to the Church, that which hee vnder|stood not himselfe. I marke this, to stop the blas|phemous mouthes of some Atheists, who in disgrace of this Prophecie, haue beene bold to say, that S. <HI>Iohn</HI> vnderstood not what he wrote to the Churches.</P>
<P>The third sight is Spirituall, and singular, per|taining<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 Spirituall, pro|per to Saints, chosen and called.</NOTE> to Saints onely, called and chosen: This is a sight of Gods fatherly and mercifull Face, shining vpon vs in Christ, bringing with it to our foules ioy vnspeakeable and glorious. And this sight we haue in this life, but in the least degree: for now wee see that glory of God, but <HI>in a mir|rour,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Cor. 3. 18.</NOTE> through a vaile, darkely; so that, in compa|rison of that sight which we shall haue hereafter, the Spirit of God accounts this sight to be no sight: <HI>We walke not by sight, but by faith;</HI> And S.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Cor. 5. 7.</NOTE> <HI>Peter</HI> affirmes, <HI>Wee haue not yet seene him;</HI> but<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Pet. 1.</NOTE> S. <HI>Iohn</HI> saith, <HI>When hee shall appeare, wee shall see</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Iohn 3. 2.</NOTE> <HI>him as hee is;</HI> Yet euen the sight that now we haue by faith, sustaines vs, that wee faint not: yea, makes vs to <HI>reioyce in him with ioy vnspeakeable and glo|rious.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Pet. 1. 8.</NOTE></P>
<P>The first sight is no comfort, without the third: For oh! How pittifull is the estate of that man,
<PB N="63" REF="40">
who hath an eye to see the Sunne, and hath not an<NOTE PLACE="marg">The naturall sight can bee no comfort without the spirituall.</NOTE> eye to see Him that made the Sunne? Yea, the second is not comfortable without the third. What auailes it to fore-see, and fore-tell things to come, and not to fore-see that Wrath which is to come, that thou maist eschew it? <HI>Balaam</HI> was a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Numb. 24.</NOTE> great Prophet, to point out Iesus Christ vnto others, in whom he had no part himselfe: Hee fore-saw that the death of righteous men was happy, and wished it to himselfe, but hee had not true Light to leade him in that life, which might bring him to a happy death. Thus, in the third sight onely, stands the comfort of Christians. <HI>Si|meons</HI> sight maketh <HI>Simeons</HI> Song, and sendeth away Saints out of the body, reioycing in the middest of the dolours of death. All these three sights had Saint <HI>Iohn,</HI> but here hee sees these Visi|ons by the second sight.</P>
<P>Now this sight is relatiue to the sight hee saw before, <HI>After this I looked;</HI> and it renders this les|son: S. <HI>Iohn</HI> hauing vsed well the Reuelation hee receiued in the first Vision, and hauing deliuered<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two things increase grace in a Preacher.</NOTE> it faithfully to the Church, as he was comman|ded, gets now another Vision reueiled to him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Conscientious vsing of that which he hath.</NOTE> Two things increase heauenly reuelations in a Preacher: First, if he vse well the talent recei|ued already, <HI>Nec enim alimonia haec distribuendo</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ber. in Psal. qui habitat.</NOTE> <HI>minuitur, sed potius augetur ministrando:</HI> For hea|uenly<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Carefull cra|uing of that, which he hath not.</NOTE> food is not diminished by the distribution thereof, but rather is augmented. Next, if hee looke vp to God by feruent prayer, and seek more;
<PB N="64" REF="41">
as here S. <HI>Iohn</HI> doth, hee shall neuer want comfor|table matter to deliuer, in God his Name, to the Church. But alack, where men come out, <HI>Promp|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> docere, quod non didicerunt,</HI> ready to teach that which they haue not learned; looking downe, to giue vnto people, not first looking vp, to seek from the Lord: what hope of a blessing is there to such a Ministerie?</P>
<P><HI>And behold, a dore was opened.</HI>] By this Meta|phoricall<NOTE PLACE="marg">No entrance can wee haue to things hea|uenly, except God open the doore.</NOTE> speech, S. <HI>Iohn</HI> will signifie vnto vs, that an entrance, and cleere sight of these heauenly Mysteries was made vnto him by the calling of God, which otherwise were hid, and locked vp from him, like excellent things in the Palace of a King, whereof no sight is gotten till the dore be opened, and men licensed to enter in. So S. <HI>Paul</HI> by the <HI>Opening of a dore of faith to the Gentiles,</HI> will<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 14. 27.</NOTE> expresse that entrance to the faith, which Gentiles had gotten by his Ministerie, and by the <HI>great</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2.

<P><HI>In Heauen.</HI>] <HI>Hugo, Carthusian,</HI> and others of that sort, by the Doore vnderstand Christ, and by heauen, the Church: it is a truth, that Christ and his Church sometime are so figured, but it is
<PB N="65" REF="41">
not the truth of this place. I maruell what should haue moued <HI>Cotterius,</HI> a iudicious and lear|ned Writer; to follow them; This Heauen (saith hee) is, <HI>Ecclesia in qua Deus habitat,</HI> the Church wherein God dwels, and the Voice which spake vnto S. <HI>Iohn, Verbum est quo vocamur in Ecclesiam&punc;</HI> It is the Word, by which wee are called to the Church. All by purpose, for was S. <HI>Iohn</HI> now in <HI>Pathmos</HI> to bee called to the communion of the Church. But leauing this, when wee shall come (if the Lord please) to such places of this Prophe|cie, where the Heauen is a type of the Church Militant, or Triumphant, we shall shew the reason thereof.</P>
<P>But here, that we may vnderstand with sobrie|ty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heauen three waies taken in holy Scripture.</NOTE> let vs consider how Saint <HI>Iohn</HI> speakes, as hee saw: He saw not this Vision in the Earth, nor in the Aire, but in the heauen was it represented to him. It is true, most part of things prophesied here, were to be performed on the earth, but they are fore-shewed in the heauens, to tell vs, that the earth, and all things which fall out therein, are ruled by the Decree of Heauen. To make this yet more cleere, let vs be remembred that in holy Scripture, Heauen is sundry waies taken; First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 For the Church Tri|umphant.</NOTE> for the Church Triumphant, their place, and their persons are both exprest by the name of Heauen; as, when it is said the two Witnesses were<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reu. 11.</NOTE> taken vp into heauen. Next, for the Church Mi|litant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 For the Church Mili|tant.</NOTE> in the Gospell, &amp; in this Reuelation, co~mon|ly called Heauen: But in this, and many other pla|ces
<PB N="66" REF="42">
of this Prophecie, Heauen is taken for that ty|picall<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 For the Church repre|sentatiue.</NOTE> representation of heauen made to him in this Prophecie. For it is to bee noted, and obser|ued, as a necessary rule, that in these Visions S. <HI>Iohn</HI> speakes of things according as hee saw them represented in types (as we haue spoken be|fore) yet so, that euery type hath a truth corre|spondent to it, and it requires great discretion to accommodate euery Type to the owne truth.</P>
<P>Which is not done by them, who in this place<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. <HI>Iohn</HI> learned not these my|steries in the Church mili|tant, nor from it, but for it.</NOTE> expound heauen to be the Church Militant: for S. <HI>Iohn</HI> saw not, nor learned not these Mysteries in the Church, nor yet from the Church, hee saw them represented to him in heauen, to be reuea|led to the Church. In a word, he got it indeed for the Church Militant, but not from it. Neither is there any more reason to say that heauen here is the Church Militant, then to say that these things which S. <HI>Paul</HI> saw, when hee was rauished to the third heauen, hee saw them in the Church: for at<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Cor. 12. 2, 4.</NOTE> this time also, was S. <HI>Iohn</HI> rauished and transpor|ted in Spirit.</P>
<P>Alway we learne here, that wee can haue no<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lord who taught him to know them, must also teach vs, or else wee cannot learne them.</NOTE> knowledge of heauenly things, vnlesse the Lord open the doore, and discouer them vnto vs. The Iewes euery Saturday, read in their Synagogues a part of <HI>Moses,</HI> and the Prophets; these point with the finger vnto Christ, but they cannot see<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Cor. 3.</NOTE> him, for a <HI>Vaile couereth their mindes,</HI> till the Lord illuminate them. Wee doe therefore pray the Lord our God, who opened the doore to S. <HI>Iohn,</HI>
<PB N="67" REF="42">
through which hee saw these Visions, to open a doore to vs also, by which we may haue entrance to vnderstand them, for the glory of his name, and comfort of his Church.</P>
<P><HI>And the first Voice which I heard, &amp;c.</HI>] Vpon<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the voice which S. <HI>Iohn</HI> heard.</NOTE> this place <HI>Victorinus</HI> obserues, that it was one Spirit which spake in the Prophets of old, and in the Apostles now. <HI>Cotterius,</HI> in the first Vision (saith hee) <HI>Iohn</HI> heard a Voice speaking onely, but here, a Voice speaking with S. <HI>Iohn, quo non obscu|r&egrave; innuitur verbi (quod personam suam habet) &amp; nostri communio;</HI> whereby the communion of the Word with vs is not obscurely declared. Both these are good points of Diuinity, but too hardly picked out of this place. The more soberly wee handle the Prophecie, we shall vnderstand it the better.</P>

This we may<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sufficient is it for vs, that S. <HI>Iohn</HI> vnder|stood it, and makes vs also to vnderstand it.</NOTE> be sure of, and it should content vs that his ser|uant vnderstood very well what the Voice said to him, which we may perceiue by his owne decla|ring of it vnto vs. And now out of this, the lesson ariseth; The Apostle looked vp to God in the
<PB N="68" REF="43">
beginning of this Verse, desirous to see more, and now the Lord offers not onely new sight to his eye, but new information to his care: Wee neuer turne our hearts truely to the Lord, but hee is readie to meete vs; All his children finde this in experience. Certainely, if wee would be more<NOTE PLACE="marg">If we wait on God, hee shall reueale him|selfe vnto vs.</NOTE> homely with our God, we should soone finde him more familiar with vs. But alas, our sinne is, we wait not vpon him, and intertaine not a spirituall fellowship with him. How shall wee see, that de|light not in the light? And how shall we bee re|plenished with that grace which ouerflowes in him, so long as we are carelesse, and negligent to come to him? This is the ground of all our euill, neglect of the spirituall worship, neglect to waite vpon the Lord. God giue vs eyes to see it, and hearts to mend it.</P>

But alas, farre are we from this perfection, it is a difficill thing to liue in the company of pro|fane men, and not be infected by them: If we be not burnt with their fire, hardly shall we escape vn|blacked with their smoke.</P>
<P>The other wing for couering their feete, is their Modesty, whereby they dimit themselues to our capacity: they appeare with bodies and colours, white, sprickled, and red, hauing indeed neither<NOTE PLACE="marg">zach. 1.</NOTE> bodies nor colours, yet are men astonished and confounded at their lowest apparitions: So farre are we degenerate from our first estate, that wee cannot now abide the most modest, and base ap|parition of an Angell.</P>

Prayer &amp; praise<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prayer and prayse are good parts of diuine wor|ship, but praise the most ex|cellent of the two.</NOTE> are two excellent parts of Diuine worship, but of the two, praise is the most heauenly and Angelike vertue.

<P>The tenor of their song followes, wherein three<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three things in their song doe they as|cribe to the Lord.</NOTE> things are attributed to God, 1. <HI>Holines,</HI> 2. <HI>Omni|potencie,</HI> 3. <HI>Eternitie.</HI> The first of these hath one word thrise repeated, and that as <HI>Esay</HI> saith, with an <HI>Antiphonie,</HI> or answering of one Angel to ano|ther,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Esay 6.</HI> Ang. de side ad Pet. cap. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Vnum Iehouam celebrant repetendo vnum &amp; idem (Sanctus) Trinum agnosc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">nt ter repetendo, quod vni tribuerunt:</HI> they acknowledge one GOD, whom they esteem onely holy, and repeating one thing thrice, a Trinitie they acknowledge in that blessed Vnitie of the Godhead; but this mysterie is better warranted by other, and more pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e te|stimonies of holy Scripture. But to returne, the
<PB N="114" REF="66">
Lord is so holy, that he is holinesse it selfe. As the<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Holinesse, which is so proper to him, that there is none so holy, as the Lord.</NOTE> Sunne is among the lights of the firmament, so is the holy Lord among his Saints or holy ones; what light they haue, is no light if it be compared with the Sunne, they hide themselues when the Sunne shineth, and all the holinesse of most holie creatures, is nothing in comparison of the thrice holy Lord. At his brightnesse Angels couer their faces; they are holy by creation, redeemed ones are holy by communication, other things are also holy by separation, as was Ierusalems Temple of old, and now are the elements in both the Sacra|ments holy; but none, neither Angel, man, nor a|ny other creature, holy like the Lord.</P>
<P>The next thing they ascribe vnto him, is Om|nipotencie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Omnipotency consisting in these two: 1. That he can do what hewil. 2. That against his nature and truth hee can doe nothing.</NOTE> which consists in these two; First, that he can doe whatsoeuer he will. Next, that against his owne nature and truth, he cannot do: for that were impotencie, and not omnipotencie: <HI>He can not lie,</HI> nor deny himselfe, nor come against his owne Word. The first of these renders instructi|on for Atheists; the other for Papists. It is a com|mon question of profane men, whereby they im|pugne the truth of Gods promises, How can this<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mouthes of A|theists who cal Gods power in question, bound vp.</NOTE> be? The Samaritan Prince, when he heard <HI>Elize|us</HI> prophecie of plentie of victuall, that should be in Samaria on the morrow, though the day be|fore it was sore pinched with Famine, most dis|dainefully answered him, <HI>Though the Lord would</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2.

<PB N="115" REF="66">
the contrary, This the Lord cannot doe: but the Lord was and will be found true, and euery man a lyer.</P>
<P>Yea, the very deare children of God, out of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Weakenesse of Saints helped by the consi|deration of God his omni|potency. Gen. 18.</NOTE> remanents of their infidelitie, oftentimes fall in|to the like transgression. When the Angel promi|sed <HI>Sara</HI> a child, she receiued it with the like answer, <HI>How can this be, sith I am waxed old?</HI> Yea, when the Lord promised to giue Israel flesh enough for a moneth, <HI>Moses</HI> distrusted it, <HI>Shall all the Sheepe and</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Numb. 11. 22.</NOTE> <HI>Beeues be slaine for them to find them? or shall all the fish of the Sea be gathered to suffice them?</HI> But they in effect receiued one answere, <HI>Is the hand of the Lord</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Esa. 50. 3.</NOTE> <HI>shortned, or is there any thing impossible to the Lord?</HI> Consider who he is that saith <HI>hee will doe,</HI> and all such doubts shal cease, which makes men enquire, <HI>How can this be done?</HI></P>
<P>The other renders instruction for Papists; they<NOTE PLACE="marg">Papists abuse the omnipo|tency of God, in making it militant a|gainst his truth.</NOTE> vrge Gods omnipotencie, to prooue their new|found, and fond transubstantiation, but to no pur|pose; for in this they make his power to fight a|gainst his will, and to reuerse his owne Word, &amp; the plaine Articles of our faith. They inforce vp|on vs that we deny Gods omnipotencie, but with|out cause; this fault is their owne, and not ours, <HI>They limit the Holy One of Israel,</HI> and indeed deny<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 78. 41.</NOTE> his power, when they say, He cannot giue vs the body of Christ, except he create it of bread. We verily belieue, that in the holy Sacrament there is a real donation made of Iesus Christ to all reue|rent and right Receiuers, <HI>that bread</HI> is the body of
<PB N="116" REF="67">
Christ, <HI>that wine</HI> is the blood of Christ. God is al|waies as good as his Word, and giues vs no lesse, then he saith he giues vs. But for all this, there is no reason why we should bind the Lord to transub|stantiate the Bread, as if without transubstantiati|on of the bread, hee were not able to giue vnto vs the body of Iesus.</P>
<P>Now the third and last thing for which they<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 They ascribe to him the praise of eternity.</NOTE> praise the Lord, is his Eternitie, and euerlasting Beeing, <HI>Who was, and who is, and who is to come.</HI> This is a circumlocution of his Name, <HI>I am,</HI> ex|pounded more plainly in the next words, <HI>Hee li|ueth for euermore.

<P>The third circumstance, is of the instruments<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 The instru|ments where|with they praise God. 1. Harpes. 2. Vials.</NOTE> which they vse in his praises. It is said, <HI>Euery one of them had Harps and golden Vials full of odours,</HI> none of them wants, euery one of them haue. It contents them not that their companions prayse God beside them, euery one of them haue their owne Harpe, and praise God for themselues. Let vs learne of them, how we should behaue our selues in the assembly of Saints. Vnder the Law no man might appeare emptie before the Lord: it is now a greater sinne vnder the Gospell, to come to the House of God, and no sacrifice in our heart to offer vnto the Lord. Let vs take heede to our<NOTE PLACE="marg">Euery Angel hath his in|strument for Gods praise, learning euery man to do the like.</NOTE> selues, the Lord knowes his owne. <HI>Israelites in whom there is no guile,</HI> when they sacrifice, then hee <HI>smelleth a sweet sauour:</HI> hypocrites he knoweth also, that sit in the seate of sacrificers, but offer no sa|crifice to the Lord; they may maske themselues,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 1.</NOTE> but the Lord cannot be deceiued, for hee knowes<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 8. 21.</NOTE> them as they are, and wil deale with them, as they deale with him; <HI>With the vpright, thou wilt shew</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 18.</NOTE>

<P>Their Harps note two things; first, the great<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their harpes doe note two things.</NOTE> ioy they haue in praysing GOD. There is no ioy on earth comparable to that, vvhich is found<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 The great ioy they haue in praysing God.</NOTE> in the praysing of GOD, and praying vnto him. When our Sauiour prayed, then was his countenance changed: when <HI>Dauid</HI> played vpon<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 17.</NOTE> the Harpe, the euill spirit that troubled <HI>Saul,</HI> de|parted<NOTE PLACE="marg">1.

<P>Againe, it noteth the sweet harmonie, and con|cent<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 The sweet har|mony &amp; con|cent that is a|mong them. Psal. 133. 1.</NOTE> that is among them: They are many, and haue seuerall Harpes, but all agree in one sound, and Song: <HI>O how good, and how comely a thing it is for brethren to dwell together!</HI> O how great is the glory of Saints, when they all speake one thing, and all minde one thing!</P>
<P>This was the happinesse of the Primitiue<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 1.</NOTE> Church, the <HI>multitude of beleeuers was of one heart,</HI> but shortly after were they diuided, by an vnne|cessarie<NOTE PLACE="marg">1.

The

euill is more then we can mend, at least, let vs<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sinne of this age, that the bond of loue is broken by them, who prosesse one faith.</NOTE> mourne for it, and pray, <HI>Thy will, O Lord, be done in earth, as it is in heauen:</HI> And let euery man take heed vnto himselfe; hee is a sacrilegious renter of the Church, who breakes the bond of loue with his brother, in whom hee sees no rupture of the vnity of faith.</P>
<P>But for our further instruction, let vs know, that<NOTE PLACE="marg">The right Harpe of a Christian is his Heart.</NOTE> the Harpe of a Christian, wherewith he praises God, is his Heart; the strings of the Harpe are the affections of the Heart, which must be well tuned and prepared, before they can make any melodie to the Lord; <HI>My heart is prepared, and I will sing,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 57.</NOTE> said <HI>Dauid.</HI> Then is the heart like vnto a ten strin|ged<NOTE PLACE="marg">Then is the Heart well tu|ned, when it answers the Lord in obe|dience to his Law.</NOTE> Instrument, when it is inclined to the obedi|ence of God his ten commandements; for as a Musicall Instrument makes no pleasant complete sound, if any string thereof be broken; so the heart of man, if it be possessed, and thralled with any vice, cannot rightly praise the Lord. The truth is, we can keepe no commandement of the Law, as we should, this is the perfection of de|grees, which in this life no man can attaine vnto:<NOTE PLACE="marg">This a Christi|an doth in per|fection of parts, not of degrees.</NOTE> yet hath the Christian a begunne obedience to all the commandements of God, which is the per|fection of parts: Both these are true, the most perfect Christian cannot keepe one of the Lords commandements as hee should, and so we deny vnto him the perfection of degrees; and yet hee keepes all the commandements of God by a be|gunne obedience, and so wee grant to him the
<PB N="157" REF="87">
perfection of parts; for there is no grace need|full to saluation, but euery true Christian hath some part, and measure thereof.</P>
<P>Bastard Professors cannot make this melodie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bastard Pro|fessors repro|ued.</NOTE> they flatter themselues because they are free of some sinnes, when notwithstanding they are cap|tiued by other great sinnes, which raigne in them, and command them. The commandements of the Law are so linked together, <HI>that he who transgres|seth</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iam. 2. 10.</NOTE> <HI>one, transgresseth all.</HI> If one string of this In|strument be broken, all the rest are distempered: and therefore do tehy farre deceiue themselues, who diuide the Law: In some things they are content to subiect themselues vnto it; in others, vsurpe a liberty to breake it, which will neuer be allowed. These answer the Lord, as an <HI>Eccho</HI> doth<NOTE PLACE="marg">They answer the Lord, as the Eccho doth a mans voice.</NOTE> the voice of a man, it resounds in part, but not wholly: or like <HI>Naaman,</HI> are content to serue God, but with an exception, or reseruation of some sinnes, which they cannot, nor will not cast siom them. There is no man so euill, but in some things he will seeme to bee good: but this is not the good, which the Lord requireth; such euill diui|ders can make no concord of spirituall Musick to the Lord.</P>
<P>Now with their Harpes, they are said to haue<NOTE PLACE="marg">With their Harpes they haue also gol|den Vials.</NOTE> golden Vials full of Odours; and those Odours are expounded by the Lord, to be the <HI>Prayers of the Saints,</HI> which openeth a cleere entrance to these words, which otherwise had beene more obscure.

These Saints represent the whole Church Militant and Triumphant, euery one of them is said to haue their own Viall, and no word here of any prayers made by any of them for o|thers; beside, that the knowledge of our desires
<PB N="161" REF="89">
appertaineth to none but the Lord, <HI>who searcheth the reines and the heart.</HI></P>
<P>This doubt cannot be loosed, by saying that the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foure sorts of prayer menti|oned in holy Scripture.</NOTE> Saints departed offer vp thanksgiuing; for the word vsed here, is not <GAP DESC="foreign">, but <GAP DESC="foreign">. Some make this answere, but indeed it taketh not away the doubt; for vnderstanding therefore of this place, we must know that there are foure sorts of prayer reckoned here by the Apostle: the first is <GAP DESC="foreign">, a prayer for auerting of euill; the second is <GAP DESC="foreign">, a prayer for some good that is lacking; the third is <GAP DESC="foreign">, a prayer; whereby one of vs<NOTE PLACE="marg">1.

<P>All these foure sorts are vsed by Saints militant:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of these foure two only are ascribed to Saints trium|phant.</NOTE> two of them onely are ascribed to Saints trium|phant, namely, <GAP DESC="foreign">, and <GAP DESC="foreign">, thanksgiuing, and supplication, for the good which they want. Where if it be asked, What good want they who<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saints trium|phant want two things for which they pray.</NOTE> are in heauen, for which they haue need to pray? The answer is, They want a two-fold good, which God hath promised, and they long to enioy. First, they want their bodies, without which the soules<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 They want their bodyes.</NOTE> in heauen cannot haue full ioy; for by their first creation they were ioyned together, as insepara|ble companions not to be diuided, if they had not fallen in the transgression; therefore it is, that the one cannot be fully contented, wanting the other, for which to fulfill their ioy, they pray for restituti|on of their bodies. Secondly, they want their<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 They want their brethren</NOTE> brethren, the remanent me~bers of Christ his my|sticall
<PB N="162" REF="90">
body, requisite necessarily to their perfecti|on: for <HI>God hath so prouided, that they vvithout vs</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 11. 40.</NOTE> <HI>should not be perfected. Abraham, Isaac, Iacob,</HI> haue<NOTE PLACE="marg">Without these they cannot be perfected.</NOTE> great ioy in heauen, but not full ioy, because they will not be perfected without their brethren. That therefore the mystical body of Christ may be co~|plete, and so their ioy fulfilled, they pray for Christ his second comming, which cannot be, till the last and youngest of the sonnes of God be borne, and brought to the fellowship of Iesus Christ. And this is made cleare heereafter, when the soules vn|der the Altar are brought in crying, <HI>How long, O</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reue. 6.</NOTE> <NOTE PLACE="marg">They cannot pray for our particular ne|cessities.</NOTE> <HI>Lord, how long, &amp;c!</HI> For this is the voice of them who want something they would faine haue, and yet are sure to enioy it. Thus we see then, that the prayers of Saints triumphant are generall, they pray for their bodies and brethren; but to gather of this that they know our necessitios&punc; our particu|lar tentations, farre lesse our secret desires, is but a doting dreame: and if we shall a little insist in this same metaplior of Odour, or Incense, it shall dis|couer their error more clearely.<NOTE PLACE="marg">This same place by three arguments improues prai|er to Saints.</NOTE></P>
<P>For first, Incense offred to God, might not be made, but in such a manner and with such ingre|dients as God himselfe commanded; teaching vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 30.</NOTE> that prayer vnto God should be made, not as we<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Incense might be made no o|ther way then God comman|ded: so pray|er, &amp;c.</NOTE> fansie to our selues, but as hee hath commaunded vs. Now, if wee shall looke to this co~mandement, it directs vs to pray vnto God, and to none other; there is the voice of God the Father, <HI>Call vpon me in the day of thy trouble, I will deliuer thee, and thou</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalm. 50.</NOTE>
<PB N="163" REF="90">
<HI>shalt glorifie me.</HI> There againe is the instruction of God the Sonne, <HI>When yee pray, pray in this manner,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 6. 9.</NOTE> <HI>Our Father which art in heauen;</HI> and there is the direction of God the holy Ghost; hee teacheth vs in our prayer to cry <HI>Abba, Father.</HI> No word heere<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 8.</NOTE> of any prayer to <HI>Abraham, Moses,</HI> or <HI>Esay,</HI> to Che|rubim, or Seraphim, to Angels, or Saints depar|ted.</P>
<P>Secondly, Incense might not be burnt but vp|on<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Incense might not be burnt but vpon the golden Altar: so prayer may not be offred to God in the name of any but Iesus.</NOTE> the golden Altar onely, whereof there was but one, figuring the Lord Iesus; teaching vs that our prayers may not be offered to God in the name of any other, but Iesus Christ onely; <HI>For there is not any other name vnder Heauen, by which wee may be saued;</HI> and, <HI>In him onely is the Father well plea|sed.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 17. 5.</NOTE></P>
<P>Thirdly, it was not lawfull for any man to make<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 Incense made for the Lord, might not be applyed to a|ny but to the Lord. So prayer, &amp;c.</NOTE> an odour for his owne pleasure, or priuate vse, of those gummes whereof the Lord commanded his Incense to be made, and that vnder a most strait penaltie; for so stands the Law, <HI>Yee shall not make vnto you any composition like to this Perfume, it shall be holy for the Lord: whosoeuer shall make like vnto</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 30. 37, 38</NOTE> <HI>that, to smell thereof, euen hee shall be cut off from his people.</HI> And this doth plainely teach vs, that no creature should smell the sauour of our Prayer: it is the Incense holy to the Lord, and appertaines to our God onely.</P>
<P>Thus we see, how Papists when they seeke pa|trocinie<NOTE PLACE="marg">What patroci|nie Papists find in Scrip|ture.</NOTE> for their errors from holy Scripture, doe it with no better successe, then <HI>Ioab</HI> did, when hee
<PB N="164" REF="91">
made his refuge to the hornes of the Altar; hee fled vnto it, to seeke the safety of his life; but hee was pulled from it, and executed to the death: so they, when they bring in Scripture to defend their errors, doe in effect bring it, to destory them|selues.</P>
<P>But to leaue them: let vs consider for our com|fort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why prayer is compared to perfume.</NOTE> how our prayer is compared to a perfume. All the spices of Myrrhe, Cynamon, and what&punc; is most excellent on earth, cannot make such a per|fume; from heauen it commeth, and vnto heauen it returneth.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THe fourth point to be considered here, is their<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fourth circumstance is their song.</NOTE> Song, which now followeth. It is called a new Song; not as some Diuines thinke, because it is an Euangelike song: for euen vnder the Law they had their new songs. <HI>Sing vnto him a new</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 33. 3.</NOTE> <HI>song, sing cheerefully with a loud voice.</HI> And againe, <HI>He hath put in my mouth a new song of praise to our</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 40. 3.</NOTE> <HI>God.</HI> And againe, <HI>Sing vnto the Lord a new song,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Esa. 42. 10.</NOTE> <HI>and his praise from the ends of the earth.</HI> Both before the Law, and vnder it, they had the Gospel; yea their ceremoniall law was <HI>Euangelium inuolutum,</HI> a Gospell inclosed in ceremonies and figures.</P>
<P>It is therefore called a new song, first, in com|parison<NOTE PLACE="marg">For three cau|ses is their song called a new song.</NOTE> of the preceding song, which wee haue in the end of the fourth chapter; there they praysed him for the benefit of Creation, heere they prayse<NOTE PLACE="marg">1</NOTE> him for the benefit of Redemption. Secondly, it<NOTE PLACE="marg">2</NOTE> is called a new song, as his Maiesty hath well ob|serued, <HI>because our Redemption ought to be new and fresh in the hearts of all them, that would be accounted thankfull.</HI> Thirdly, it is called a new song, in re|spect<NOTE PLACE="marg">3</NOTE> of the new affection, wherwith Saints praise God; and this new affection ariseth of new sight

<P>But because Angels also sing their part of this<NOTE PLACE="marg">New matter of ioy mini|stred to Saints and Angels, maketh al|wayes a new song.</NOTE> new song, wee must see how it is competent to them; what benefit they haue by the Redemption of Iesus, wee shall heare shortly; onely now wee touch the new song; they, and redeemed Saints glorified in heauen, cannot but sing a new song, because they find alway in GOD new matter of ioy, which mooueth them with renewed affecti|ons to praise him. So infinite a Good is the Lord, that they finde alway new good comming from the Lord to refresh them, not that at any time they haue wearinesse, but for the variety of ioyes wherewith they are continually delighted: <HI>for in</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 36. 8.</NOTE> <HI>his face is the fulnes of ioy.

<P>There is nothing on earth so excellent, but con|tinuall<NOTE PLACE="marg">Earthly plea|sure, if it bee perpetuall, be|comes painful.</NOTE> looking on it, breeds a lothing and disdain of it.

<P>_THE Vision of Preparation<NOTE PLACE="marg">At the sixth chapter be|gins the Visi|ons of pre|diction, which are three.</NOTE> being ended in the two pre|ceding Chapters, as we haue declared before: now fol|lowes the Visions of Predic|tion, fore-telling things which shortly must be done; And these are three, euery one of them diducing the estate of the Church to the second comming of Christ vnto Iudgement: As at more length wee haue shewed in <HI>Prolegomenis,</HI> wherein the generall Method of the Reuelation is shortly set downe.</P>
<P>The first Propheticall Vision is contained in<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first in the sixt and seuenth chap|ters.</NOTE> this sixt, and the seuenth Chapter following; for the seuenth is an appendix of this, and hath in it
<PB N="190" REF="104">
a larger explication of the fifth and sixth Seale, as (God willing) we shall heare: so then the first Prophecie is absolued in six Seales, whereof the last concludes with the Day of Iudgement; for the seuenth Seale hath in her bosome the seuen Trumpets, which make vp the second Prophecie of this Booke, beginning at the eighth Chapter;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The second fro~ the eighth to the twelfth.</NOTE> for till then, the seuenth Seale is not opened, and continuing to the end of the eleuenth, there it con|cludeth with the Day of Iudgement. The third<NOTE PLACE="marg">The third fro~ the 12. to the 21.</NOTE> Prophecie beginnes at the twelfth, and continues to the one and twentieth; whereof, if the Lord please, we will speake hereafter.</P>
<P>This first Prophecie, as I said, is generall, for<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first Pro|phecie is a ge|nerall Progno|stication of the estate of things to the worlds end: Whereof the summe is, Christ will go by his Gospell thorow the world, till hee ouercome.</NOTE> it containes a generall Prognostication, and pre|sents to vs a view of the estate of things, as they will be to the worlds end: whereof the summe is, Christ shall go thorow the world vpon the Ministerie of his Word, preaching the Gospell where, and when it best pleaseth him. This is pro|phecied in the first Seale, like a crowned King, and Conquerour, hee hath gone out long agoe vpon his White Horse, and so shall hee continue till hee ouercome. But this victorie, let not the Church looke that it shall be without bloud; for Satan and his Instruments, figured by the Red<NOTE PLACE="marg">The world will persecute the Gospell.</NOTE> Horse, and one riding on it, shall in most cruell manner persecute the Preachers and Professors of the Gospell; and this is fore-shewed in the second<NOTE PLACE="marg">For contempt of it God shal plague the world.</NOTE> Seale: but they shall not escape vnpunished: for the Lord shall send out the Blacke Horse, as is told

in the third Seale; and the Pale Horse, who comes out at the opening of the fourth Seale: By these two, famine and pestilence, vnder which all other horrible plagues of God are comprehen|ded, shall the Lord be reuenged on the world, for contempt of his Gospell.</P>
<P>And because in these troubles many of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">In these perse|cutions and plagues, Saints may be exer|cised, but the Lord shall se|cure them.</NOTE> Saints of God shall suffer bodily death, it is de|clared in the fift Seale, how their soules rest in peace with God, till the number of their bre|thren be fulfilled; and then, as they cry for iudge|ment, so the great and last Day of Iudgement<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Day of Iudgement shall conclude all.</NOTE> shall come, as we see in the sixt Seale: for we shall see in the next Chapter, that the onely cause, why Angels delay the execution of the last wrath, for which the Soules of Martyrs vnder the Altar cry vnto God, is, that the seruants of the Lord are not yet sealed: which being once done, then <HI>shall the Lord recompense trouble to them that trou|bled</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2.

And this, any iudicious man that will reade with|out<NOTE PLACE="marg">The seuenth Chapter con|taines a larger explication of the fift and sixt Seale.</NOTE> pre-conceiued opinion, may easily consider that the seuenth chapter hath in it no Propheticall Prediction, but onely a larger explanation of the fifth Seale, in which <HI>Martyrs</HI> are willed to waite, <HI>till their fellow-seruants be sealed:</HI> and the secure,

and happy estate of Saints euen in suffering; yea, their glorious and ioyfull estate after suffering, is at great length expressed, before the comfortlesse estate of the wicked, whereunto the sixt Seale de|liuers them, be touched at all. Thus haue we the summe of this first and generall Prophecie.</P>
<P>Now before the opening of the first foure<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three things noted in S. <HI>Iohn</HI> his pre|paration, be|fore the ope|ning of the Seales.</NOTE> Seales, S. <HI>Iohn</HI> is prepared: where we haue these circumstances; first, what was S. <HI>Iohn</HI> doing, when this Vision was presented to him; to wit, <HI>Beholding:</HI> secondly, who prepares and wakeneth him, <HI>One of the foure liuing Creatures:</HI> and third|ly, what saith he to him, <HI>Come, and see.</HI></P>
<P>The first is noted in these words, <HI>After I be|held.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 What was S. <HI>Iohn</HI> doing at this time, to wit, Behol|ding; &amp; what his beholding imports.</NOTE> S. <HI>Iohn</HI> hitherto hath seene many glorious Visions, and yet now hee lookes for more. Sure it is, that euery sight of heauenly things which Saints get, prouokes them to a desire of more; for there is not a greater argument of grace recei|ued, then a feruent desire of further grace. Be|side the desire, this beholding imports a constant consideration without wearying, or wauering: a stable and fixed minde, with a perfect heart, is re|quired in them who would learne things heauen|ly. The naturall eye, if it bee closed, or if it bee <HI>Circumactus,</HI> tumbling and waltring in the head; or then, if it looke negligently, cannot see nor take vp those things which are before it; and so is it with the eye of the soule; if it attend not stedfast|ly, and carefully to heauenly things, it cannot per|ceiue, nor vnderstand them.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="105">The second circumstance is, by whom is hee<NOTE PLACE="marg">By whom is S. <HI>Iohn</HI> prepared for the recei|uing of this Vision.</NOTE> prepared, that is, by one of the foure liuing crea|tures; that is the first of the foure, as the learned Interpreters haue sufficiently cleared. They who expound these foure liuing Creatures, to signifie the vvhole order of Preachers, by the first of them vnderstand, the first Preachers after the Apostles; namely, <HI>Quadratus,</HI> and <HI>Aristides, Ahentenses</HI> of the Church of <HI>Athens;</HI> By the second againe, <HI>Iu|stinus Martyr,</HI> and <HI>Melito Sardenses,</HI> of the Church of <HI>Sardis.</HI> But this vnto me (with the reuerence I<NOTE PLACE="marg">These foure Beasts who prepare S. <HI>Iohn</HI> cannot bee Preachers, &amp; why?</NOTE> owe to so laborious men) seemes an idle specula|tion: or, if they will, a Diuination, without Di|uinity, or warrant of the Word: For S. <HI>Iohn</HI> heere is sent out to waken Preachers and Profes|sors. In the seuen Epistles he warnes euery Prea|cher of his duty; and in the Prophecie of things to come, he fore-warnes and armes Preachers and all Christians, of such battels as are before them. And how these Interpreters will bring in Prea|chers to be wakeners and warners of S. <HI>Iohn,</HI> I vn|derstand not.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Neither yet can they bee the foure E|uangelists; for S. <HI>Iohn</HI> was an Euangelist himselfe.</NOTE></P>
<P>Others againe, who by the 4. Beasts vnderstand 4. Euangelists, as <HI>Haymo, Berengandus, Carthusia|nus,</HI> with many others before them, and many al|so after them, haue here occasion, if they will em|brace it, to correct themselues<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">: for there are here foure one after another, who waken S. <HI>Iohn:</HI> if they be foure Euangelists, then Saint <HI>Iohn</HI> must bee the fifth, or else yee must say that hee warned himselfe&punc; <HI>Ribera</HI> the Iesuit is the onely man of any

Beasts are the 4. Euangelists; he sees here a manifest light arguing the contrary, yet doth he what he can, to defend that which he had learned from the darke Lights and Doctors of Rome. It would pittie a man, to see how he py|neth himselfe in wrestling against a cleere verity: Therefore we adhere to our former interpretation, that these foure Beasts signifie a company of prin|cipall Angels, who are neerest the Throne, and that by one of them S. <HI>Iohn</HI> is wakened &amp; prepared; For albeit the Lord in his ordinarie working tea|cheth men by the Ministerie of Men, and not by Angels; yet in his extraordinarie working, so long as his Wisedome thought expedient to vse it, hee hath taught men, euen by <HI>Angels.</HI></P>
<P>And in that the Voice of the <HI>Angel</HI> who wakeneth<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first Voice that wakened S. <HI>Iohn,</HI> was like a Trumpet, the next like Thunder.</NOTE> him, is said to haue bene like the noise of Thunder, it is first for the matter it selfe, to tell vs that great and fearefull things are heere fore-told vnto vs; next, for the person of S. <HI>Iohn,</HI> to whom they are reuealed, that hee might bee stirred vp to receiue them the more reuerently, he was at the first wake|ned with a Voice like a Trumpet, and now hee is wakened with a Noise like Thunder. And this, done to him a diuine man and heauenly disposed, may and should warne vs of our great weakenesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great need haue we to be wakened. whe~ God speakes to vs.</NOTE> sluggishnesse, and senselesse securitie. O what need haue we to be wakened, as oft as the Lord is con|tent to speak vnto vs! <HI>Peter, Iames</HI> and <HI>Iohn,</HI> not|withstanding
<PB N="195" REF="106">
they had seene the glory of <HI>Christ</HI> transfigurate on the Mountain, yet being with him in the Garden, albeit he required nothing of the~ but that they would watch and pray; he burthened them not to drinke of his bitter cup, but onely wil|led them to pray, yet they fell asleep: and albeit he wakened them both the first &amp; second time, yet the third time hee came, and found them sleeping againe. In them let vs see our own weakenesse; we haue need, not once, but often to be wakened, or else the Lord may speake, but we shall heare in vaine, and sleepe in carelesse security.</P>
<P>The third circumstance is the warning it selfe<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 The warning it selfe, Come and see.</NOTE> which is giuen him, <HI>Come and see.</HI> Our Sauiour hath the same <HI>dictum</HI> to the two Disciples of S. <HI>Iohn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 1. 39.</NOTE> who demanded of him, <HI>Rabbi, where dwelst thou?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">This notable sentence, vsed also by Christ, hath in it two things.</NOTE> <HI>Come &amp; see,</HI> said our Lord.

That this Ri|der on the white Horse is the Lord Iesus, is cleere out of the 19. Chap.

be left to their idle speculations: And this same collation of these two places, reproues them who limit the Rider on the white Horse, vnto a cer|taine time; some to the destruction of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and others to the daies of <HI>Constantine;</HI> they de|fraud the Church of great comfort; for so long shall this valiant man of warre fight on Horse|backe, <HI>till hee haue made all his enemies his foote|stoole,</HI> and deliuered his Saints from their oppres|sion.</P>
<P>If it be demanded here, seeing Christ is the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ is so in|finite a Good, that it is no maruell, if in one Vision he be many waies figured.</NOTE> opener of the Seale, how is hee also reuealed by the Seale? The answer is easie, Iesus Christ is so infinite a Good, and his blessing so manifold, that many manner of waies is he shadowed vnto vs; yea, in one, and the selfe-same Vision sundry waies figured: Hee is the Reuealer, and the Thing re|uealed; the Teacher, and the Matter which is taught; the Sacrifice, and the Sacrificer; the Way, and Hee who guides vs in the way. Certainely, if we knew what an incomparable iewell Iesus is, we would with the Apostle, <HI>account all things dung,</HI> in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 3. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">.</NOTE> comparison of him.</P>
<P>The next point is the Horse whereupon Christ<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 The second point is, the White Horse.</NOTE> rideth: the exposition of this is to be sought from the Psalmist, where Christ, euen as here, is descri|bed going out, like a valiant King; <HI>Gird thy sword</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 45. 3, 4.</NOTE> <HI>vpon thy Thigh, O most Mighty, and prosper with thy glorie, ride vpon the word of truth, meekenesse, and righteousnesse, &amp;c.</HI> So the Horse, whereupon this Conquerour is carryed through the world, is

the Ministerie of the Word. <HI>Primasius</HI> by the<NOTE PLACE="marg">This figureth the Ministery of the Word.</NOTE> Horse vnderstands Apostles and Preachers. Mi|nisters, without the Word, are not to be receiued; and the Word without a Minister able to preach it, is not profitable: These two, the Lord in his most wise dispensation hath ioyned together: For <HI>it hath pleased God by the foolishnesse of Preaching, to</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 1. 21.</NOTE> <HI>saue them who beleeue.</HI> The Horse then is the Mi|nisterie of the Word. The Gospell preached is the Chariot and Horses, whereby this King is car|ried through the world. As in the gouernement of the world hee vseth the Ministerie of Angels; so in the gathering and gouerning of his Church, hee vseth the Ministery of Preachers; <HI>Who can</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 10. 14.</NOTE> <HI>heare but by Preaching, and who can preach, except they be sent?</HI></P>
<P>These are figured by Horses: first, for the cou|rage<NOTE PLACE="marg">Good Prea|chers resem|ble Horses in courage.</NOTE> wherewith they are endued; This is obser|ued by the Lord himselfe, as a speciall property of the Horse: <HI>He mocketh at feare, and is not afraid,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob&punc; 39. 25.</NOTE> <HI>hee turneth not back from the sword.</HI> And doubt|lesse Preachers, in whom Christ is, and vpon whom hee rides, are valiant, and couragious men;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezech. 3. 9.</NOTE> <HI>Their fore-head is like the Adamant, and harder then the Flint:</HI> They feare no death, they faint for no<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are far from timidity:</NOTE> trouble, that can follow them in the seruice of Christ. Notable was that answer of <HI>Andrew</HI> the Apostle, when <HI>Egeas</HI> Gouernour of <HI>Patris,</HI> vpbrai|ded him with the death of the Crosse: hee answe|red, that he would neuer haue preached the ho|nour and glory of the Crosse, if he had feared it.
<PB N="199" REF="108">
And as the seruants of God are farre from that timiditie which makes men vnfaithfull in the cause of God; so are they as farre from temerity, where|by<NOTE PLACE="marg">And as farre from temerity.</NOTE> men ignorantly zealous, are precipitate, and carried head-long to accelerate for euery light conceite of their braine, trouble on themselues: Their zeale is like a fire kindled of stubble or straw, which makes a faire blaze for the time, but because it hath no matter to maintaine it, vanisheth incon|tinent, and endeth in vngracious smoaking. I wish we had no example of any such among vs: it is a shame to the Gospell, to speake the one day, and retreate the other. A wrong cause will neuer furnish strength in trouble: wisedom requires that men before-hand should ponder and consider well the cause, for which they will resolue to suf|fer affliction.</P>
<P>Againe, Preachers are figured by Horses: and<NOTE PLACE="marg">The type of Horses is vsed to shew how Christ propa|gates the Gos|pell speedily.</NOTE> Christ going forth to conquer, appeares riding on a Horse, to note the speed and celerity which hee was to vse in propagation of the Gospell.

<P>And againe, as the Horse is bridled and ruled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Preachers should bee bridled, ru|led, and tur|ned, as he who rides on them will command them.</NOTE> and turned here or there, by him that rides vpon it, and is not left to himselfe to wander where-away he will: so is it with Preachers of the Gospell, they are directed to Countries, Kingdomes, and Cities, at the good pleasure of Christ; they nei|ther come nor go by accident, but by the proui|dence of God. A notable example hereof we haue in S. <HI>Paul,</HI> hee was of purpose to go to <HI>Bi|thinia, but the Spirit suffered him not;</HI> yea, com|manded<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 16.</NOTE> him to go to <HI>Macedonia.</HI> And albeit now the Lord doth not informe his seruants by such extraordinary reuelations; yet doth he still worke with them in the same manner, appoin|ting them to such places and people, as in his Wisedome hee thinkes most expedient. <HI>Take heed</HI>

<P>Other riders are helped by their horses, but heer<NOTE PLACE="marg">Other riders are helped by their horse, but here the horse is helped by the rider.</NOTE> the horse is helped by the rider; for what is a Prea|cher, if Christ bee not with him, and worke in him? he is like a Pen without a hand, it can write nothing; a tongue without a heart, it can speake nothing; a musicall instrument without one to touch it, can make no sound at all: <HI>We are not able</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2.

<P>It is written of <HI>Bucephalus,</HI> the horse of <HI>Alexan|der,</HI> that hee would suffer none to ride vpon him, but his owne master; whether that be true or not, sure it is, this is most true, Preachers should not be Asses like <HI>Issachar,</HI> couching downe to receiue<NOTE PLACE="marg">All Christians should take heede, that none but Christ, ride on them, and rule them.</NOTE> euery burden that any man will lay vpon them, but they are horses for Christ onely to ride vpon.</P>

<P>But to returne and conclude this second point:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Preachers are such horses as haue need both of bridle &amp; spurre.</NOTE> As there is no horse which needeth not the spurre and the bridle, the one to stirre him forward, the other to gouerne him in the right way; that he go not where-away he will himselfe, but as the rider directs him. So is it with Preachers; we are many times inclined to faint, and loyter in our calling; to waken vs, some Cananites must be stirred vp to bee pricks in our sides, or else within vs God stir|reth vp our owne Conscience to put vpon vs. And as to the other he bridles the mouthes of his ser|uants, he opens them to speake how, and when he pleases: <HI>In that houre it shall be giuen you what ye shal</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 10. 19. 20.</NOTE> <HI>say; for it is not ye that speake, but the Spirit of your Father that speakes in you.</HI> Againe, he closeth their<NOTE PLACE="marg">Preachers transported by Iesus from one place, yea from one pur|pose to ano|ther, whereof themselues know not.</NOTE> mouth, when he sees it expedient. So said he to <HI>Ezekiel, I shall cause thy tongue cleane to the roofe of thy mouth.</HI> In a word, as I said before, that hee carries Preachers from place to place, according to his pleasure; so in preaching, hee carries them from purpose to purpose; hee puts in their heads
<PB N="203" REF="110">
that which they intended not to haue spoken, hee makes them forget that which they thought sure to haue deliuered, and so ouer-rules their memorie, and bridles their mouth, that still hee makes them his owne purpose. Happy, yea thrise happie are they, who this way are ruled by the Lord.</P>
<P>A notable example heereof wee haue in <HI>Augu|stine:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Example here|of in Saint Augustine.</NOTE> for <HI>Possidonius</HI> records of him, that in a cer|taine Sermon his memory failed him, and that be|side<NOTE PLACE="marg">Possidon. de vita Augustini.</NOTE> his intention and purpose, hee fell out into a discourse against the <HI>Manichaeans.</HI> When he was come home, hee demaunded of them who dined with him, if they had marked it? They said, in|deed they had: to whom he answered, <HI>Credo quod forte aliquem errantem in populo, Dominus per no|stram obliuionem, et errorem doceri, &amp; curari volue|rit.</HI> It may be, as I thinke, that by my obliuion, and miscarrying from my purpose to speak against that heresie, GOD will haue some among the people to be taught, and cured of it. <HI>Nam in eius manu sunt, et nos, et Sermones nostri,</HI> for in his hand are both our selues, and our speeches, to frame them as he will. And so indeed it was as the man of God tooke it; for within two dayes, <HI>Firmus</HI> a <HI>Manichaean</HI> came to him, and shewed him how by the same Sermon he had been conuerted. <HI>Vnde stupentes glorificauimus sanctum eius nomen, qui cum voluerit, et vnde voluerit, et quomodo voluerit, et per scientes et nescientes, salutem Sanctorum opera|tur.</HI> Whereupon, they who were in <HI>Augustines</HI>

<P>Let this glory be reserued to the Lord, he works saluation oftentimes by Preachers, that Preachers know not of themselues. The Preacher knowes not your troubles, your tentations, nor the estate of your soules, yet euery Professor prepared reue|rently to heare, thinks that the Preacher speakes vnto him; but this, as I haue said, is the finger of God, who by the ministery of one, speaketh, and worketh in many, as he will.</P>
<P>The third point is the colour of the horse: he is<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 The third point is, the colour of the horse which is white; noting two things.</NOTE> said to be <HI>a white horse;</HI> the white colour noteth two things: first, puritie and holines that should be in Preachers: the Lord will not ride vpon vn|cleane beasts, nor haue his Name carried through the world by profane men; he will not, he cannot<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 The purity &amp; holinesse which should be in Prea|chers.</NOTE> worke with an vnsanctified Ministerie.

Let them therefore be cleane, who carry the vessels of the Lord: let vs study to be holy, the Lord will not ride but vpon white horses: <HI>Vita munda ipsa est luce fulgentior,</HI> a holy life<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chrysost. in Mat. hom. 15.</NOTE> is brighter then light it selfe.</P>
<P>Secondly, the white colour signifies the ioy|fulnesse<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 The white co|lour noteth the ioyfulnesse of the message which they bring.</NOTE> of the message which they bring, there is no black nor dolefull thing in it. In holy Scrip|ture, when Angels appeared to bring good ty|dings, we find them clothed in white; and among men it hath been customably vsed for a signe of gladnesse. The Emperours of Rome in their so|lemne triumphs had their Chariots drawne with<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pompon.

Great ioy was in Ierusalem, when <HI>Dauid</HI> brought the Arke into it. Great ioy in Samaria, when <HI>Phi|lip</HI> preached the Gospel vnto them. <HI>Beautifull are</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts. 8. 8.</NOTE> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay. 52. 7.</NOTE> <HI>the feet of them, who bring the glad tydings of peace.</HI> But miserable are they, who find neither peace nor ioy in the preaching of the Gospel; these may be sure, that dolefull tydings abide them.</P>

Armour, <HI>He had a bowe.</HI> No mention is made here<NOTE PLACE="marg">4 The fourth point con|cernes the ar|mour of him that rides: Bow and Ar|rowes.</NOTE> of arrowes; but in the 45.

therewith. Such an arrow shot hee at <HI>Iu|das,</HI> he might not abide, but desperately hanged himselfe, which yet helped not to release him of his paine.

<PB N="249" REF="133">
naturall brethren cannot all be the heires of their father; but Christians, as they are all the sonnes of God, so are they all the heires of God: neither is the inheritance diminished by communication thereof vnto so many.</P>
<P>The other is, that we are called their fellow-ser|uants:<NOTE PLACE="marg">How all Saints are fellow-ser|uants.</NOTE> so also doe they acknowledge themselues to be our fellow-seruants, <HI>Conseruus tuus sum,</HI> I am<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reuel. 22. 9.</NOTE> thy fellow seruant, said the Angel to Saint <HI>Iohn.</HI> Angels then and Saints glorified, are not our <HI>Pa|troni,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Angels are not our patrons, but our pat|terns of whom we should learne.</NOTE> <HI>sed Conserui,</HI> they are not our Patrons, that by our prayers to them, wee should seek protecti|on from them, but they are our fellow-seruants: and this should stirre vs vp in all carefulnesse to be answerable to our name, that wee may serue and praise the Lord our God, and euery way doe his holy will in earth, as it is done by them in Hea|uen.</P>

The other reason is more pungent, for it is said here plainly, that at the dark|ning of the Sunne and Moone, at the departure<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Apostasie could not ter|rify great men, as here them|selues being authors and actors of it.</NOTE> of heauen, &amp; falling of starres, Kings, Great men, and Captaines were terribly afraid, and therefore cannot it be vnderstood of Apostasie, and defec|tion, whereof they themselues were both authors and actors. Was it the obscuring of the light of

the Gospel, that made them to cry out, <HI>Rocks and Mountaines, fall vpon vs and couer vs?</HI> It can stand with no sense: for so farre were they from all feare for that matter, that by the contrary they reioyced in it, and did what they could to extinguish the Gospel, and erect heresies, to force Preachers and Professors vnto defection: and in so doing, they thought they did good seruice vnto God.</P>
<P>Others againe take it for a denuntiation of some<NOTE PLACE="marg">Neither is this sixt seale to be vnderstood of a temporall iudgement.</NOTE> externall and temporall iudgement, such as vvas executed on Persecutors, and specially vpon <HI>Dio|clesian.</HI> It is true, that in the holy Scripture many of the phrases vsed here, are vsed also to expresse fearefull temporall iudgements, threatned against particular states, and persons of wicked men.</P>

<P>Now, because this is a speciall note and maine

point, the right vnderstanding whereof, will giue<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arguments mouing some Interpreters to thinke&punc; that the sixt seale cannot import the Day of Iudgement, are answered.</NOTE> light to the method of the vvhole Prophecie: we are to know, that the reason mouing sundry lear|ned Interpreters to thinke that this seale cannot be expounded of the Day of Iudgement, is, for that there are many Prophecies following, which must be fulfilled before that Day; but this difficul|tie shall easily be remooued, if they consider the ground we haue already laid out of <HI>Primasius,</HI> that the Reuelation is <HI>Prophetia saepius repetita,</HI> a Pro|phecie sundry times repeated, and diuers wayes diducing the estate of the Church, from the daies of Christ, to his second Comming againe.

<P>But to returne, this sixt seale concludes this first generall Prophecie, with a Propheticall de|nuntiation of the Day of Iudgement, and so wee<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 The seuenth seale for etels nothing as the rest doc, but in|troduces seuen trumpets to foretell.</NOTE> expound it, for these reasons, besides others, which we haue shewed before.

<P>Next, heere is an vniuersall change of all cre|atures in Heauen and Earth, vvhich neuer

<P>For after our Lord hath foretold of great per|secutions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5 Collation of this place with the words of our Sauiour, proues that it is so.</NOTE> apostasies, heresies, &amp; of false Christs, which were to come, he subioynes, <HI>And immedi|atly after the tribulation of those daies, shall the Sun be darkned, and the Moone shall not giue her light: and the starres shall fall from heauen, and the powers of</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 24. 29.</NOTE> <HI>heauen shall be shaken.</HI> Now that these speeches are<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 21. 25.</NOTE> not to be taken allegorically, but properly, as con|tayning<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marke 13. 24.</NOTE> a prediction of that fearefull concussion of this Vniuerse, which shall be made in that great Day of the Lord, is most euident by that which followes; <HI>Then shal appeare the signe of the Sonne of</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Who can deny this to point out the Day of Iudgement?</NOTE> <HI>man in the heauen, &amp;c.

<P>_THIS Chapter is a pendicle of the precedent, and apper|taines<NOTE PLACE="marg">The depen|dance of the seuenth Chap|ter vpon the sixt.</NOTE> to the first Prophecie of this Booke, which we cal|led <HI>Generall.</HI> In it, <HI>per Ana|basin,</HI> we haue a larger expli|cation of the fifth and sixth<NOTE PLACE="marg">It hath a lar|ger explicati|on of the fift and sixt Seales</NOTE> Seales; with a notable consolation for the godly, presently subioyned after the Prediction of that most fearefull, desperate, and comfortlesse end of the wicked, which shortly will come vpon them. For there we heard all manner of reprobate men sorrowfully lamenting and crying, that Moun|taines might couer them. Here we are all told,
<PB N="269" REF="143">
that the godly shall not be inuolued with them in their desperate estate, the Lord by his owne Seale separates them from the wicked, and fore|shewes that happy estate wherein they shall liue for euer, and euer.</P>
<P>The Chapter hath two parts: the first enlarges<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two parts of this chapter.</NOTE> that which hath beene briefly set downe in the fift and sixt Seale; for in the fift Seale, Saints cry for a<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 In the first is declared, how the last Iudge|ment is delay|ed, till Saints be sealed:</NOTE> dissolution of the world, and for finall iudgement, to auenge their bloud on them who dwell on earth: there they are desired to rest, vntill their fellow-seruants were fulfilled. In the sixt Seale, that dissolution of the world, and iudgement on the wicked, craued by Saints, and promised by the Lord, is represented to S. <HI>Iohn.</HI> Both these, in the first part of this seuenth Chapter are more cleere|ly expounded. For first, S. <HI>Iohn</HI> sees foure Angels standing at the foure corners of the earth, ready to ouerturne the world, and to fold it vp like an old Vesture, as was figured in the sixt Seale: and this we haue, ver. 1. Next, these Angels are inhi|bited and forbidden to destroy the world, vntill the seruants of God be first sealed, and secured, as was promised in the fift Seale: and this we haue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 In the second, the happy condition of Saints is de|clared, direct|ly contrary to the miserable condition of the wicked, in the sixt Seale.</NOTE> ver. 2. 3. together with the number of them that are sealed, till we come to the thirteenth verse. From that to the end, is described the happie condition of Saints, set downe in plaine termes, and directly opposite to that wofull condition of Reprobates, mentioned in the sixt Seale: so this, from ver. 15. to the end, makes vp the second
<PB N="270" REF="144">
part of this Chapter: The first part letting vs see, how the world is conserued, till Saints be fulfilled and sealed: the other part shewing vs their ioyfull and happy estate.</P>
<P>Wherein it is very comfortable to obserue the<NOTE PLACE="marg">A short oppo|sition marked of these two, for the greater comfort of Saints.</NOTE> opposition which is made betweene the misera|ble estate of the wicked, in the end of the sixt chapter, and happy estate of Saints, in the end of this seuenth: They had shed the bloud of the ser|uants of God, and therefore the <HI>Moone</HI> with a bloudie face lookes vpon them, and all creatures concurre to bee auenged of them. Heere the Saints come safe through all these tribulations, and make their Robes white in the bloud of the Lambe: There the Sunne waxed black, and with|drew his light from the wicked; heere Saints haue no need of the light of the Sunne, for the Lamb gouernes them, ver. 16. 17. And <HI>the glory of God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reu. 21. 23.</NOTE> <HI>and the Lamb is their light.</HI> Againe, there the wic|ked flie from the presence of God, and may not abide it; but here Saints are in the presence of the Throne of God, ver. 15. There the wicked cry, that Mountaines might hide them from him that sits on the Throne: but here, hee that <HI>sitteth on the Throne,</HI> dwelleth among his Saints, and they serue him for euer, ver. 15.</P>
<P>These things thus compared together, may let<NOTE PLACE="marg">This euident|ly shewes the seuenth Chap|ter to bee a pendicle of the sixt.</NOTE> the iudicious Reader see, how this Chapter is a proper pendicle of the sixt, explaining at length some things shortly, and obscurely set downe in the former. So that in these two Chapters we haue
<PB N="271" REF="144">
the first Prophecie of this Booke, which I call generall, absolued; and in the beginning of the eighth Chapter, we are to looke for a second Pro|phecie, which continues to the twelfth.</P>
<P><HI>And I saw foure Angels.</HI>] This Verse, as I haue<NOTE PLACE="marg">What the foure Angels at the foure corners of the earth doe sig|nifie.</NOTE> said, lets vs see, how the Angels standing at the foure corners of the earth, are ready to ouerturne the world, and to fold it vp like an old <HI>Vesture,</HI> if the Lord did not stay them. That they are said to be foure, is a certaine number for an vncertaine, yet imports it that they are sufficient; for one, at euery corner of a sheet, or vesture, as the Psalmist<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 102. 26.</NOTE> termeth this Vniuerse, are able enough to fold it vp.</P>
<P>What these Angels are, whether good or euill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">God doth his worke, both by good and euill Angels.</NOTE> is disputed among the Diuines, but without a cause: for sometime by good Angels the Lord punisheth euill men, as was done to the <HI>Egypti|ans, Sodomites</HI> and <HI>Assyrians:</HI> sometime by euill Angels hee exerciseth good men: so S. <HI>Paul</HI> was buffeted with an Angell of Satan; for maruellous is the Lord in working with his Saints: Satan in his fighting against them, fights for them, and de|stroies himselfe into them.</P>
<P>But that these are good Angels, appeares by<NOTE PLACE="marg">But that these are good Angels, may appeare out of the Text.</NOTE> the speech which Christ vseth vnto them, ver. 2. <HI>Hurt not the earth, till wee haue sealed the seruants of our God in their fore-head:</HI> hee speakes to Angels, hee speakes of Saints redeemed, and inuolueth them both in the fellowship of one God with him|selfe. Beside this, the execution of that last Iudge|ment
<PB N="272" REF="145">
is commonly ascribed to the holy Angels; <HI>The Lord shall descend from heauen with a showt,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Thess. 4. 16.</NOTE> <HI>and with the Voice of the Arch-Angell, and with the Trumpet of God.</HI> And againe, <HI>When the Sonne of</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 25. 32.</NOTE> <HI>man shall come in his glory, the holy Angels shall al|so come with him, then shall the sheepe bee separated from the Goates.</HI> That this shall be done by An|gels, is euident in the Parable of the Haruest; <HI>The</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 13. 39.</NOTE> <HI>Haruest is the end of the world, the Reapers are the Angels.</HI> And to this same purpose Angels here are brought in, as executors of the last Iudgement, to ouer-turne the world.</P>
<P><HI>Holding the foure windes of the earth.</HI>] I leaue<NOTE PLACE="marg">This verse is not to be ex|pounded alle|gorically.</NOTE> here those allegoricall interpretations, whereby this is expounded to be the restraint of the Gos|pell, which is the breathing of the holy Spirit for the saluation of the Elect. This agrees to the A|nalogie of faith, but comes not in pertinently here; for these spirituall plagues are seuerally and distinctly fore-told by themselues in the second Prophecy beginning at the eighth chapter, where|as this first generall Prophecie denounceth plagues corporall, or externall, sword, famine, pestilence, beasts, whereby the Lord punishes the contempt of his Gospell, Preached to the world by him who rideth vpon the White Horse.</P>
<P>We still keep our former ground, that by the<NOTE PLACE="marg">The restrai|ning of the winde, is a type of the dissolution of the world.</NOTE> holding of the winds, that they blow not, a disso|lution of the world, and destruction of all crea|tures therein is here declared: for if we shall com|pare the foure Elements among themselues, al|beit
<PB N="273" REF="145">
at all we can want none of them, yet the most necessarie, at least, which wee may want shortest space, is the Aire, for it is by respiration that eue|ry thing liueth, which is endued with sense: take breath away from man, and beast, they perish in|continent; and such as haue the vegetatiue life, as<NOTE PLACE="marg">No liuing thing can en|dure, without motion of the Aire.</NOTE> trees, or plants, without motion of the Aire, they wither and decay: yea, without it, the fire burneth not, the Sea moues not, but putrifies and stinkes, and the creatures which are therein die. So much worth to man and the creature, is this one, among the smallest of Gods benefites, euen the benefite of the Aire; which <HI>Pisida</HI> properly called a gift, that could not be gotten for siluer: But man, not considering what he hath, cannot bee thankefull. Alway, this with-holding of the winds, that they blow not, which the Angels are ready to doe, if they were not stayed by a superiour power, imports (as we haue said) the destruction of the world, and all creatures therein contained, which shall stand no longer, then the Saints of God be once accom|plished.</P>

It is a pretty meditation of S. <HI>Basil:</HI> If thou had st,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Folly to neg|lect the life to come, for loue of this.</NOTE> sayes he, two children, where of the yonger by cer|taine knowledge were not able to liue; the elder again were most liuely: wouldst thou be so foolish, as to spend all thy eare &amp; thy substance vpon the dead childe, and reserue nothing for the other? <HI>Si melioricuncta dare nolueris, diuide saltem ex aequo:</HI> If<NOTE PLACE="marg">Basil. Ser. 3. in diuit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s auaros.</NOTE> thou wilt not giue all to the best and eldest, at least diuide it equally between them.</P>
<P>Thy two children are thy two liues: the one temporall, the other eternall: the eldest is life e|ternall: it was ordained for vs before the foundati|ons of the world were laid: this childe is liuely, neither subiect to death, nor any kinde of disease: the yonger childe is life temporall, a languishing life: deadly diseased is this childe, and will not liue. Shall wee therefore be so foolish, as to care for that, which cannot be conserued, and neglect the other which endureth for euer, and is able, if it be ours, to conserue vs also, in a most happie, and immortall fellowship with our God in Christ, for euer, and euer? The Lord make vs wise in time, to consider this, that we may make choise of the best.</P>
