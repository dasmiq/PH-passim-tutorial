<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THat which <HI>follows,</HI> had, for the substance
of it, appeared abroad before now, but
for the strange Imprudence of a Printer,
and base Treachery of a certain Licen|ser;
who was intrusted by him (wholly unawares
to the <HI>Writer</HI>) with an imperfect Copy, and, as to
the latter Part, a <HI>first</HI> Draught; which was promi|sed
to be returned home again, to have added or al|tered
what should be thought fit.</P>
<P>And whosoever shall be offended at what is here
Published, as taking themselves to be disobliged by
it, I assure them it is not written from the least
<HI>Ill-Will</HI> to any Person in the World, but from the
greatest <HI>Good-Will;</HI> and that not onely to the best
of <HI>Causes,</HI> but also to those <HI>Men</HI> who are most
like to be <HI>incensed.</HI></P>
<P>Methinks I hear now our cautious Politico's ask|ing,
<PB REF="3">
What ayls this Person to be thus Busily
Interposing in the behalf of <HI>those,</HI> who must needs
by their extraordinary Zeal be Exposing themselves
to the high Displeasure of <HI>some,</HI> and the Censures
of <HI>others,</HI> as a sort of Hot-headed and Rash Men?
But if they'll vouchsafe to read what is here writ|ten,
I hope they'll see no just C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">use to Accuse him
of being Over-Busy. But indeed, tho' the A|postle
saith, <HI>It is good to be always zealously
affected in a good thing:</HI> And tho' their cool
Wisdomships can be as Hot as their Neighbours in
their <HI>own</HI> Concerns, yet 'tis ordinary with many of
them, to pass sly Reflexions upon all Religious Zeal.
But why Zeal should not <HI>best</HI> become a Cause, wherein
the Honour of Almighty God is most highly concerned,
and our Country-Mens Happiness in the World to
come, and <HI>this</HI> World too, they are too Wise to of|fer
at a Reason.</P>
<P>But they'll Object, That the <HI>Ill-timeing</HI> of a
Good thing will make it Chargeable with Indiscretion.
And who knows not this? But how can Zeal for
so good a thing as the Reformation of our Man|ners,
be ever <HI>Ill-timed?</HI> What is Absolutely ne|cessary,
'tis impossible should be set about Unseaso|nably.
And it Argues a mighty Distrust of the
Divine Providence, to fear, from the Angering of
<PB REF="3">
the Vicious Part of the Kingdom, any Evil that
can be greater, than the Good of suppressing Vice,
or so great. Nay, this savours of downright Infi|delity
and Irreligion. Nor seems it much <HI>less</HI> Cul|pable
to think, That the disobliging of Wicked Men
will be a weakning of this Government. For 'tis so
far from being true, that the Governments giving
all possible Discouragement to Vice, may be a Means
to endanger it, that nothing can conduce more to
the strengthening and securing thereof, nor so much
neither; and that <HI>naturally,</HI> as well as through the
Blessing of God Almighty. H<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">nest <HI>Tully</HI> hath told
us as much as this comes to. The Offence which
profane and vicious Men may take at the Government,
is a meer <HI>Scare-Crow;</HI> For so long as they see
it for their <HI>Interest,</HI> to Adhere to it, there is
no Fear but they <HI>will;</HI> and they'll put on a shew of
being Reformed, nay and Ape a <HI>Zeal</HI> too for Refor|mation,
rather than hazard their Preferments under
it, or their Prince's Favour: And 'tis certain that
the Government can be secure of <HI>such</HI> no <HI>longer,</HI>
than their <HI>Interest</HI> holds them fast to it, tho' their
Vices should be never so much connived at. But it
hath been much observed both in City and Country,
that those whose Conversations are none of the strictest,
did upon the late Execution of the Laws, with some
<PB REF="4">
Briskness, express great liking of it, in hopes of
having for the future, their Children and Servants,
under <HI>better</HI> Government. And the Truth is, the
Height of Viciousness, to which the Youth of this
Nation, and especially of this City, are arrived, is
a most Melancholly Subject to reflect upon; but not
to be <HI>Wondred</HI> at any more, that that bad <HI>Exam|ples</HI>
should be more powerful than good <HI>Precepts.</HI>
And this presents us with as sad a Prospect, of the
Age's being still <HI>more</HI> and <HI>more</HI> Corrupted, and of
the <HI>next</HI> Ages proving <HI>worse</HI> than <HI>this,</HI> if <HI>more</HI>
Time should be lost; and the setting in great earnest
on the Work of Reformation be longer delayed.
And I need not add, that the longer it is so, the
Work will every Year be the more difficult.</P>

<PB N="7" REF="4">
<HEAD>A Vindication
Of a Late
Undertaking of Certain Gentlemen, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE most deplorable Degeneracy of this
Nation in its Morals, occasioned by the
Encouragement, which for many years to|gether,
(for a well-known Reason) was
given to Vice, raised in the minds of se|rious
People, very strong Apprehensions of approach|ing
Judgments; and accordingly very great ones
came down upon us; and <HI>Two</HI> such, as no Age hath
parallel'd in these Kingdoms, within a few years af|ter
the Return of King <HI>Charles.</HI> But those having
produced nothing of Reformation, they were follow|ed
with others from time to time; and these like|wise
being lost upon us, at length we had all the rea|son
in the World to look for the heaviest Calamities
that could befal us, <HI>viz. <HI>Popery</HI></HI> and <HI>Slavery;</HI> but
when these were at the door and just entering, so
infinitely Merciful was He to us, <HI>Whose ways are not
as our ways, nor whose thoughts as ours,</HI> as strangely
to surprize us with a happy Deliverance.</P>
<P>And the blessed Instrument thereof, with His most
Virtuous Consort, being by God's wonderful Provi|dence
plac'd on the Throne, never were so great
<PB N="8" REF="5">
Hopes conceived as <HI>now,</HI> of an Effectual Reforma|tion.</P>
<P>But alas, in a short time it was too apparent, that
this Deliverance came too soon, to be much valued
by such a People, as generally <HI>We</HI> were. It found
us miserably unqualified to receive it, and the Returns
we have made to the DIVINE Goodness for it,
speak us no less unworthy of the continuance of it.
For neither hath the First Part of the Deliverance,
nor the many amazing things God Almighty hath
since done, both at home and abroad, towards the
perfecting and securing thereof, had any <HI>visible</HI> good
Effect upon us. But those Vices which before reign|ed,
and cryed to Heaven for Vengeance, do reign still
as much as ever; and those who were <HI>filthy before,</HI>
let God use never so powerful Means for the cleansing
of them, <HI>will be filthy still;</HI> as if, to speak in the Pro|phets
Language, <HI>They had made a Covenant with Death,
and were at an Agreement with Hell.</HI></P>
<P>And whereas we have very good Laws for the sup|pressing
of Vice, I will not say how very few have
hitherto shewed, any thing of Zeal or an hearty
Concern (notwithstanding the highest Obligation)
for the Execution of them: Nor from how many
nothing is to be expected, but an extream Averseness
to a Reformation.</P>
<P>But to come to the Business of these Papers: Cer|tain
pious Gentlemen, all of the Church of <HI>England,</HI>
laying greatly to heart <HI>these</HI> things, resolved to make
Tryal, whether any thing could be done, towards
the giving a Check to Debauchery and Profaneness;
and joyntly pitch't upon this following Method for the
Reforming of Offenders in those <HI>Two</HI> most scandalous
Instances, by due Course of Law, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="5">
<HI>First,</HI> To endeavour the procuring of a Letter from
the Queen (the King being then absent) to the Ju|stices
of the Peace for the County of <HI>Middlesex,</HI> re|quiring
them to put the Laws in Execution against
<HI>Drunkenness, Vncleanness, Swearing, Cursing, Profana|tion
of the Lords Day, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> To endeavour the obtaining a <HI>good Order
of Sessions</HI> to be made thereon. And Her Majesty
having (like Her self) most chearfully granted the
humble Request of the Lord Bishop of <HI>Worcester,</HI> for
such a Letter; and having accordingly sent a very
pious and pressing one to those Justices; and the Ju|stices
having thereupon publish't an exceeding good
Order, These Gentlemen, encouraged with this good
Success,</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Made it their Request to many of their
Acquaintance, (and all of the Church of <HI>England</HI> too)
whom they knew to be Sober and Religious Persons,
to give Information to some Justice of the Peace, of
all Offences of the forementioned Nature, which
they should observe to be committed; as by the <HI>Or|der
of Sessions</HI> they are encouraged to do.</P>
<P>And that all possible Ease might be given to the
<HI>Informers,</HI> the <HI>Iustices,</HI> and their <HI>Clerks:</HI></P>
<P>1. They Printed Blank-Warrants against the seve|ral
Offences.</P>
<P>2. They procured divers Persons (to the Num|ber
of Eighteen or Twenty) inhabiting in conveni|ent
places of the City and Suburbs, to fill up such
Warrants, as the Case should happen to be; for the
Informers, who should carry the same to the Justice;
by which means he would have nothing more to do,
<PB N="10" REF="6">
but to Examine them upon Oath, and Sign and Seal
the said Warrants. And,</P>
<P>3. To ease the Justices Servant of the trouble of
carrying every Warrant to the proper Officer, the In|former
was to take his Warrant back with him to the
Person who filled it up; with whom care was taken
to have it executed; as will appear presently.</P>
<P>That the Penalties might be duly applyed to the
use of the Poor, and not imbezel'd by the Constables
or Church-wardens, they took this Method.</P>
<P>1. They directed every Person who filled up the
Warrants, to keep an Account or Register of the se|veral
Offenders Names, the Offence of each, the Time
<HI>when,</HI> and Place <HI>where</HI> each Offence was committed:
And, when the Informer had brought him back the
Warrant, to insert also the Name of the Magistrate,
before whom each Conviction was made;</P>
<P>2. They appointed a special Messenger, and paid
him well for his pains, to Collect all the said War|rants
and Registers weekly; and, after they were
sorted, to carry them out again to the proper Officers
of the several Parishes where they were to be execu|ted;
and to insert the Names of the several Consta|bles,
to whom each of the said Warrants should be
delivered, in the said Registers.</P>
<P>3. They prepared an Abstract of these Registers,
to be presented to the Justices at their <HI>Petty-Sessions,</HI>
for the enabling them to call every Constable to an
Account, how he had executed the several Warrants
he was Charged with in that Register; and to what
Church-warden he had payd the Penalties by him
levyed.</P>
<P>4. A short Account was to be taken out of all
those Abstracts, by which to Charge the several
<PB N="11" REF="6">
Church-wardens, at the making up of their Ac|counts
with all the Money by them received on those
Warrants, in order to their sending it to the several
<HI>Vestries</HI> once a Year.</P>
<P>And lastly, To awaken all good Christians through|out
the Kingdom, Whether Magistrates or private
Persons, to a vigorous endeavour for a Reformation
of Manners, They set the good Example of the Ju|stices
of <HI>Middlesex,</HI> and the following <HI>as good a one,</HI>
of the Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> and Court of Alder|men,
before the rest of the Nation. For which pur|pose
they caused the Orders of the said Sessions and
Court, to be Printed in a smaller Character; and of
<HI>these</HI> they sent several Thousands throughout the
Kingdom, <HI>viz.</HI> To most <HI>Parliament-Men, Mayors, Bay|liffs,
Iustices of the Peace, Ministers, Coffee-houses,</HI> &amp;c.
and the Printing and Postage too were wholly at their
own Charge.</P>
<P>And, Thanks be to God, they quickly saw extra|ordinary
good Effects hereof, in the excellent Orders
of the like nature, made by the Cities of <HI>York, Glou|cester,</HI>
&amp;c. And by the Counties of <HI>Hertford, Bucking|ham,
Bedford, Sussex, Gloucester,</HI> the North-Riding of
<HI>Yorkshire,</HI> and divers others.</P>
<P>And there was perceived very good Success of their
Endeavours at home, by the manifest ceasing in a great
measure of the Profanation of the Lords Day; and
the Awe that appeared upon many Common Swear|ers
and Drunkards, who either felt, or had Notice
of, the Execution of the Laws against such O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">fenders.</P>
<P>But for as much as another sort of Informers, who
had been so busie a few Years since, hath made that
Name odious to inconsiderate People; and that the re|straining
of Licenciousness, is ever extreamly grievous
<PB N="12" REF="7">
to the Licencious, 'twas necessary that the Justice
should be desired by the Informer to conceal his
Name from the Offender: There having been too
many Instances of late, not unknown to the Justices,
of those, who, instead of amending by the gentle Pu|nishment
of <HI>one</HI> Sin, have added <HI>more</HI> to it, by reek|ing
their Revenge on such as Informed against them,
with great Barbarity. I say the concealing the In|formers
Name, for <HI>this</HI> Reason, ought to be judged
necessary; especially when he is ready to appear, and
prove the Fact to the Face of the Offender, in case he
persists in the denial of it. And Care was taken, that
in <HI>this</HI> case the Informer should adventure to appear,
although the Law doth not oblige to it; as will be
seen anon.</P>
<P>This is an exactly true, but imperfect Narrative of
the undertaking of these Gentlemen; and is it possible
it should need a <HI>Vindication?</HI> Who would not now
wonder that such a Word as <HI>this</HI> should be seen in
our <HI>Title-Page?</HI> For can there be a Nobler Design
laid, than that which is directly and solely for the
Advancement of the Publick Good? And is not <HI>that</HI>
Good, which comprehends both the Spiritual and
Temporal Interest of the Publick, the incomparably
greatest Publick Good? And is not he a <HI>Brute</HI> who
needs to be told, that <HI>the Reformation of Mankind,</HI> and
<HI>Running down of Vice,</HI> is <HI>such</HI> a Good as contains in
it both these Interests? But <HI>this</HI> was the <HI>onely</HI> Design
of this Undertaking. And it hath been shewed, that
it was not limited to the Reformation of one <HI>City,</HI>
or one <HI>County,</HI> but it extended to the whole <HI>Kingdom.</HI>
And a due Countenance from those who are princi|pally
obliged to encourage it, must needs cause it to
have in time, an happy Influence upon both the <HI>other</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="7">
Kingdoms. And <HI>Then,</HI> how much farther in the
World it may by Gods blessing reach, <HI>HE <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"></HI>
knows.</P>
<P>Moreover; these Gentlemen were so far f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">m de|signing
to serve <HI>Themselves</HI> by this <HI>Undertaking,</HI>
that, as they were not capable of getting one Penny
for their pains, so they expended in the carrying of
it on, considerable Sums out of their own Purses.</P>
<P>Nor can they with any Justice or Charity be cen|sured,
as designing the Applause of the Sober and
Virtuous part of the Nation, (as highly as they
deserve it) for we are wholly beholden to their
<HI>Enemies</HI> for our knowledge of so much as <HI>One</HI> of the
Undertakers, or of the Undertaking it self. And
those who received the Printed Orders all over the
Kingdom, were perfectly Ignorant from whose hands
they came.</P>
<P>And as to the foresaid <HI>Method</HI> they agreed on,
for the Managing of this Design, it as little needs a
<HI>Uindication</HI> as the <HI>Design it self;</HI> and is so far from
being lyable to be taxed with Imprudence, that I
(for my part) must needs profess, I greatly admire
the Wisdom of the Contrivance. I Challenge those
who dare to Reproach it, to shew <HI>Any</HI> Project bet|ter
fitted for the Attainment of its End, than this
throughout is. 'Tis scarce <HI>Civil</HI> to desire them to
Mend it <HI>Themselves,</HI> since there is no Employment
they can be more Averse to.</P>
<P>In short, 'tis a lamentable Instance of the Debau|chery
of the Age, That it is not a piece of great
Impertinence to publish a Vindication of <HI>Such</HI> an
<HI>Undertaking.</HI> But so it is, That the Clamours of
Delinquents, which, where they are readily received,
shall never be wanting; served for an Occasion to
<PB N="14" REF="8">
Certain Gentlemen, whose <HI>Own</HI> Conversations will
not suffer them to be reconciled to the thoughts of
a General Reformation, to Calumniate it, with the
Persons concerned in it; and to do their utmost to
Overthrow it. All the Tales of punish'd Ale|House-keepers
and other Criminals, were by <HI>Them</HI>
immediately received as <HI>Gospel,</HI> since they were told
by such dis-interessed and unbyast people; and here|upon
they fall to Work. And no Wonder, for if the
Prince of <HI>Darkness</HI> had not <HI>Now</HI> bestirr'd himself, to
Baffle a Design so directly levelled against his King|dom,
this would doubtless have been the very <HI>First</HI>
time of his being unconcern'd upon such an Oc|casion.</P>
<P>And <HI>First</HI> these Persons satisfied themselves a while
with playing at <HI>Small-Game;</HI> and among other most
Notorious Untruths, they gave it out with great
assurance, That there was a wonderfully gainful Of|fice
lately set up in <HI>Lincolns-Inn,</HI> where Hundreds of
Pounds were already gotten by the Erecters of it.
And what great pity is it, provided the <HI>Tempting
Wages</HI> could have reconciled them to such <HI>Loathsom
Work,</HI> that <HI>Themselves</HI> had no interest in the Stock
going there? By my consent, they should have had
Shares <HI>Grat&igrave;s</HI> upon that condition; nay, could they
have been hyred thereby not to <HI>Hinder</HI> Business, the
Founders of the Office should have done all the
Drudgery, and <HI>They</HI> should have all the Gains, but
that the <HI>Poor</HI> ran away with every Farthing.</P>
<P>And, by the way, the Informers too who were en|gaged
in this Undertaking, refused to receive a penny
of the Penalties in those Cases wherein the Law al|loweth
them the <HI>Third</HI> part. They desired no other
Reward for so good a Work, than what they are sure
<PB N="15" REF="8">
to have in the <HI>Other</HI> World, and would have only
their <HI>Labour for their Pains</HI> in <HI>This.</HI></P>
<P>And when it appeared to every body by the <HI>Form</HI>
of the Warrants, that the Constables were to pay the
Money they had Levyed upon Offenders, to the
Church-Wardens, for the use of the Poor, the fore|said
persons found that a <HI>Lye</HI> could do them very
little Service, which was every whit as easily <HI>detected</HI>
as <HI>told.</HI></P>
<P>And now from Talking they proceed to Action;
and 'tis well known how the <HI>First</HI> Blow was given
to this Undertaking; though several Worthy Justices
of the <HI>Peace,</HI> to their Honour be it spoken, heartily
interposed for the prevention of it.</P>
<P>In order to it, they in the first place fell very
heavily on Mr. <HI>Hartley,</HI> a virtuous person, who had
given as a Justice, all possible encouragement to this
Best of Works. He was loaded with diverse Accusati|ons
of Injustice in his <HI>Proceedings;</HI> and those on which
the greatest Weight was laid, were the <HI>Two</HI> follow|ing,
whereby the Reader may judge of the rest. And
perhaps they were both <HI>True</HI> as to matter of Fact,
whatever they were as to their Faultiness.</P>
<P>One was, That the Name of the Landlord of an
Ale House was inserted in one of his Warrants, in|stead
of the Tenant's who kept the House.</P>
<P>The other, That a Woman was called in another
Warrant by the Name of her dead Husband, after
she was again Married.</P>
<P>Now as to the <HI>Former,</HI> it is said, That the Land|lord
also liv'd in the House; so that 'twas unknown
to many which of them was Master of it: However,
the House was ascertained in the Warrant, and the
Offence against the Law, there committed, positively
Sworn to.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="9">
And as to the <HI>Latter,</HI> 'Tis ordinary among the
meaner sort, to call Women, at least for some time
after their second Marriages, by the Names of their
former Husbands: And those who had not heard of
the Husbands death, might without any great Of|fence
presume him to be still Living. Nor was it
necessary that all who knew of his Death, should
know that his Widow was a Wife again.</P>
<P>These are the only Objections which we find par|ticularly
assign'd against Mr. <HI>Hartley</HI>'s proceedings,
and therefore Unpardonable Faults no doubt! But
the best of it is, they were the <HI>Informers</HI> not the
<HI>Iustices.</HI> But can any one of those who have made
such ado with these two Trifles, make any body
believe that <HI>His</HI> Justiceship (if he be in Commission)
was never so imposed on? He hath had very little
Custom, or very great Luck, if it never was. But
old <HI>Aesop</HI> hath helpt us to a true Proverb: <HI>It is an
easie thing to find a Staff to beat a Dog.</HI> But suppose
these <HI>Two</HI> were Culpable Mistakes, for want of due
Caution, as those who have made such mighty mat|ters
of them, can't think them so in the <HI>Iustice,</HI>
and scarcely in the <HI>Informers:</HI> I wish they would
seriously consider, what means that Question of our
Blessed Saviour; <HI>Why beholdest thou the Mote which
is in thy Brothers Eye, and perceivest not the Beam
that is in thine Own Eye?</HI> O how happy would it
be for, especially some of <HI>Them,</HI> were <HI>They</HI> charge|able
with no worse Mistakes, or lay they under the
scandal of nothing worse than Mistakes!</P>
<P>Such <HI>Little</HI> things as <HI>These,</HI> and which are as soon
rectified as perceived, would be easily over-look't
for the sake of the Greatness and Nobleness of the
Undertaking, by all such as heartily desire a Refor|mation;
<PB N="17" REF="9">
nay, by those who are but able to bear the
thoughts of it: Nay, one would think too, by those
who, though they would fain have none, have so
much Modesty remaining, as to be ashamed <HI>Openly</HI>
to Oppose it. Which sure none can have the impi|ous
Bravery to do, but such as would make a true
Story of the Fiction of the <HI>Giants,</HI> by designedly
fighting against GOD Himself, if they believe there
is one. And as it is eminently <HI>HIS</HI> Cause in which
these Pious Gentlemen engaged themselves; so no
Christian can doubt, nor scarce a hearty Theist, whe|ther
God hath a <HI>Special</HI> Hand in all Undertakings of
this nature; nor whether those who are employed
in them are HIS <HI>Instruments; Called, Spirited</HI>
and <HI>Assisted</HI> by Him: I mean on supposition, that
they carry on their Work by Lawful means, and trans|gress
not the Bounds of those Stations in which Pro|vidence
hath placed them. But <HI>Malice</HI> it self may be
defyed to shew any one Instance, wherein these per|sons
(the Undertakers I mean) have not strictly kept
to the observance of <HI>Humane,</HI> as well as the <HI>Divine</HI>
Laws; or acted out of their own Sphere.</P>
<P>It is evident by the foresaid Narrative, that there
was nothing in their Undertaking, but what they
had at least <HI>Liberty</HI> from our Laws to do, nay, a <HI>Com|mission</HI>
(I mean a general one) from <HI>GOD</HI> to do;
and the Queens Commission too, may be easily made
out of Her Majesties most Gracious Letter, for what
they have done; could they stand in any need of it.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="10">
As to the particular Charges against <HI>Two</HI> of the
Undertakers, and divers of the Imformers, the world
will quickly be satisfied they are mere Forgeries by
a better Hand; and therefore I will wholly wave
them. Mr. <HI>Hartley</HI> will be also Vindicated from the
other Misdemeanours objected against him in the Ex|ecution
of his Office; but I cannot forbear to touch
upon <HI>Two</HI> more of <HI>These.</HI></P>
<P>One was, That he play'd the <HI>Busy-Body</HI> in Acting
out of his own <HI>Division.</HI> And 'tis true, that he did
<HI>So</HI> act, but not that he was a <HI>Busy-Body</HI> in so doing.
For, as he did it not but when 'twas <HI>Necessary,</HI> so he
had expresly Violated his Justices Oath, if he had re|fused
it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Other</HI> was, his Convicting Offenders, without
bringing <HI>Them</HI> and their <HI>Accusers</HI> face to face. Now,
besides what hath been said to <HI>This</HI> already, which
shews the necessity of his frequently so doing, so the
Law ought not to be understood as being against it:
For the same <HI>Magna Charta</HI> which saith, That <HI>No man
shall be Condemned Vnheard;</HI> saith also, That <HI>No man
shall be disseized of his Goods or Life, but by a Tryal
per Pares.</HI> In which <HI>Latter,</HI> if an Act of Parliament
hath dispensed as to <HI>Goods,</HI> it may well be construed
so to do in the <HI>Former</HI> Clause; especially when there
is no proportion between the Crime and the Punish|ment:
I mean, when the <HI>Former</HI> is very <HI>Great,</HI> and
the <HI>Latter</HI> as <HI>Little;</HI> and <HI>This</HI> not to be inflicted but
by a solemn Conviction upon the Oath of a Credible
<PB N="19" REF="10">
person, and in some cases of <HI>Two;</HI> and the Oaths like|wise
of such, as get not one Farthing of the Penalty.</P>
<P>This is as much as we design to say, relating to the
<HI>First</HI> Blow that was given to this Undertaking. A
<HI>Second</HI> soon followed it, and this proved a <HI>Home</HI> one.
And Gods will be done, if there is no Remedy to be
had. But there is little likelihood of <HI>Any,</HI> should Good
men be so sheepish, as to conceal, or only vent to
one another, their sorrowful Resentment of fierce Op|positions
to Reformation, and such an open Contempt
as is now cast upon the best of Queens, in Baffling a
Design so well adapted to the promoting of the Bu|siness
of her Excellent Letter. And of the great En|couragement
given to Licencious publick Houses; of
several instances of which, diverse <HI>Bishops,</HI> to their no
small Trouble, have been Ear-Witnesses.</P>
<P>There is an Objection which have been too often
made against the Restraining of such Houses, <HI>viz.</HI> That
their Majesties <HI>Excise</HI> will be greatly Lessened by this
means. But who is able to think it can be Grateful to
such a King and Queen as we are now Bless't with, to
have their Revenue enlarged by the Sins of their
People? Who can be Ignorant, that there is nothing
they would more Abominate? Or that their Majesties
do not need to be told, that their Revenue must most
certainly be exceedingly diminished by the <HI>Poverty</HI> of
their Subjects; And nothing is more observed, than
that Multitudes of them do every year bring Them|selves
and Families to a Morsel of Bread, by being
<PB N="20" REF="11">
permitted so much Drink; expresly contrary to our
Laws, which lay great Restraints upon Drinking-houses,
and Drinkers in them; not only on Sundays,
but the Week-dayes too.</P>
<P>Possibly some may object against the Matter of
these Pages, <HI>that</HI> Advice of the Poet:
<Q>Dum Furor in cursu est, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
<Q><L>When you see Fury ride full speed,</L>
<L>Get out o'th' way of Fury's Steed.</L></Q>
And censure it as too Heady an Act, now Vice is
so Rampant, <HI>thus</HI> to expose our selves to the Rage of
the Vicious.</P>
<P>But it may be replyed, That whosoever is heartily
concerned at Vice's being now so Rampant, must
have the Soul of a <HI>Nit,</HI> if he fears looking it in the
Face in such a Reign as <HI>this.</HI> If he be more afraid
of Debauchees and Profane Persons in King <HI>William</HI>'s
and Q. <HI>Mary</HI>'s Reign, than many were of Papists and
Jesuites in King <HI>Iames</HI>'s. Or apprehends more dan|ger
in Attacquing those <HI>now,</HI> than these <HI>then,</HI> without
the Leave of a Licenser.</P>
<P>And as to the <HI>Governments</HI> having any Reason to
be afraid of provoking them, I add to what is said
in the <HI>Preface,</HI> that Vice is a Dastardly Cow-hearted
thing, and always sneaks when bravely born up to;
having nothing to plead in its own Defence. But
<PB N="21" REF="11">
could vicious Men invent any thing to say for them|selves,
they are still <HI>self-condemned.</HI> Their Vices also
make them too soft and effeminate, to carry on with
any Vigour a dangerous Design. Nor can they con|fide
in one another, in laying a Conspiracy, as having
no Principle to secure Fidelity: So that there is not
the least fear of their being too hard for the sober
part of the Nation; of which I hope there are an
Hundred to one on the side of the Government.</P>
<P>Were those who bear an implacable Enmity to a|ny
thing of Reformation, onely injurious to <HI>their own</HI>
Souls, the Charity we have for them, might have for|bidden
us to be silent, upon such an occasion as is now
given us; much less then can we have any Tempta|tion
to be shy of Offending them, when we consi|der
how extreamly the Publick, and Their Majesties
Great Affairs have suffered by them, and are still
like to suffer; and what heavy Judgments ought to
be expected from a most highly Provoked God, for
the Toleration of so much Wickedness, after as great
Obligations as ever were laid upon a Nation.</P>
<P><HI>Now</HI> the <HI>Third</HI> Time draws on a pace, when He,
who is <HI>the Light of our Eyes, and the Breath of our
Nostrils,</HI> designs to expose His Sacred Person for our
Safety, and the Well-fare of all Christendom, to such
Dangers as nothing but the Courage of a Matchless
Hero could encounter: And therefore 'tis <HI>more</HI> than
time, that a more effectual Course than ever be taken to
run down those Enemies at home (our Reigning Sins)
<PB N="22" REF="12">
which may do, through God's just Judgment, our
Potent Enemy abroad more Service, than all the Pre|parations
he hath made against us. And in Order
thereunto, to take all possible Care, that none be in|trusted
with the Business of Reforming <HI>others,</HI> who
need as much as <HI>any</HI> to be Reformed <HI>themselves.</HI> As
also to give all Encouragement to those, whose hearts
God hath inclined to give their helping Hand to a
Work of such Absolute Necessity, We may be much
afraid to think of the King's again leaving us, before
this be done, or at least a doing.</P>
<P>And, Thanks be to <HI>GOD,</HI> and Their Majesties,
since this was written comes the happy News, of
this Work's being again set on foot, by a most pious
Proclamation.</P>
