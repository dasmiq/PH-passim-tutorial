<HEAD>His MAIESTIES Letter to the Right
Reverend Father in GOD Henry Lord Bi|shop
of London, to be Communicated to the Two
Provinces of Canterbury and York.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SIGNED>WILLIAM R.</SIGNED></OPENER>
<P>_RIght Reverend Father in God, We Greet
you well. Whereas the Advancement of
the Honour and Service of Almighty God,
and of the Protestant Religion, which by
his wonderful Providence hath been Pre|served
and Established in these Kingdoms,
ought to be the Chief Part of Our Royal
Care: In Order to this, as We have often|times
Declared, That We would take the
Church of <HI>England</HI> by Law Established, into Our particular Pro|tection
and Favour; So We take this Occasion to Renew these
Assurances, being Resolved to do all We can for the Support
and Strengthning of it; Preserving withal the Liberty of Con|science
to all Our other Protestant Subjects which by Our Laws
they now Enjoy.</P>
<P>And because the Welfare, Peace and Honour of this Church
depends so much upon all Persons faithfully doing their Duties
in their several Places and Functions, We therefore First of all
Charge and Require you the Bishops of this Our Church, to
apply your selves with all Diligence and Zeal to the Duties of
your Episcopal Function, according to the Word of God, the
Orders of this Church, and the Laws of this Our Realm.</P>
<P>More especially as to Ordination of Ministers, We Require
you to use all possible Care and Strictness, in Examining and En|quiring
into the Lives and Learning of such Persons as desire to
be Admitted into Holy Orders, and herein constantly to observe
the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Can. 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36.</NOTE> Canons relating thereunto, the Neglect whereof We shall
strictly Enquire into, and take Care that it be Punished accord|ing
to Law.</P>
<P>We also Charge and Require you to keep a strict Watch over
all the Clergy in your respective Diocesses, to see that they be
duly Resident upon their Livings according to the Laws in that
Case Provided; and that there they be Constant and Diligent in
their Duties, performing the Publick Offices of Worship Gravely
and Devoutly, Preaching the Word of God Plainly and Practi|cally,
without running into needless Controversies, and Admini|string
the Holy Sacraments Frequently, with that Reverence
which is due to the Institutions of Christ; Also Catechizing the
Youth, Visiting the Sick and Distressed, and doing all such
Things in their Stations as may tend to promote the Honour of
God and True Religion, together with Peace and Charity a|mong
all their Neighbours; Themselves giving a good Example
to their Flock, by walking before them in all holy Conversation
and Godliness.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">And the more effectually to prevent the Scandals that may a|rise
by any Disorders in the Lives of those who ought to be Ex|amples
to others, you shall Admonish them Religiously to ob|serve
the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Can. 75.</NOTE> Canon Entitled, <HI>Sober Conversation required in Ministers.</HI>
And you shall Severely and Impartially proceed by Ecclesiastical
Censures, against all such of your Clergy as shall be found guilty
of any Notorious Violation of this or any other Law or Canon
relating to their Duty.</P>
<P>And for the better Encouragement of Deserving Men, as We
intend to make it a Rule to Our Self, so We also Require it of
you, in Disposing of Church Preferments, to have a Special Re|gard
to such Persons as by their Piety, Learning, Diligence and
Peaceableness, do most promote the Honour of God, and the
Edification of his Church.</P>
<P>And because, as Our Duty requires, We most earnestly de|sire
and shall endeavour a General Reformation of the Lives and
Manners of all Our Subjects, as being that which must Establish
Our Throne, and Secure to Our People their Religion, Happi|ness
and Peace; all which seem to be in great Danger at this
time, by reason of that overflowing of Vice, which is too noto|rious
in this as well as other Neighbouring Nations. We there|fore
require you to Order all the Clergy to Preach frequently a|gainst
those particular Sins and Vices which are most prevailing
in this Realm; And that on every of those Lords Days on which
any such Sermon is to be Preach'd, they do also Read to their
People such Statute-Law or Laws as are provided against that
Vice or Sin, which is their Subject on that Day; as namely, a|gainst<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">21 <HI>Iac.</HI> Cap. 20.</NOTE>
Blasphemy, Swearing and Cursing; Against<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">5 <HI>Eliz.</HI> Cap. 9.</NOTE> Perjury;
Against<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="marg">4 <HI>Iac.</HI> Cap. 5. 21 <HI>Iac.</HI> Cap. 7.</NOTE> Drunkenness; and against<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">29 <HI>Car.</HI> 2. Cap. 7.</NOTE> Prophanation of the Lords
Day: All which Statutes We have Ordered to be Printed toge|ther
with these Our Letters, that so they may be Transmitted by
you to every Parish within this Our Realm.</P>
<P>And whereas there is as yet no sufficient Provision by any Sta|tute-Law
for the Punishing of Adultery and Fornication, You
shall therefore require all Church-Wardens in your Diocesses to
Present impartially all those that are guilty of any such Crimes
in their several Parishes; And upon such Presentments; We re|quire
you to proceed without delay, and upon sufficient proof
to inflict those Censures which are appointed by Our Ecclesiasti|cal
Laws against such Offenders: In doing whereof, according to
your Duty, you shall not want Our effectual Assistance and
Support.</P>
<P>And for the better Carrying on of so good a Work, We do in the
last place, Charge and Require you to Preach frequently your
selves, to Confer often with your Clergy, and to Enquire by all
proper means into all Abuses and Corruptions in your Dio|cesses,
in order to a full and speedy Reformation. And all this,
not only as you shall Answer it to Us, but also as considering the
great Charge that God hath Committed to you, and the Ac|count
that you must give him for it at the Great Day. And so
We bid you heartily Farewel.</P>
