<HEAD>A Satyr against WIT.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>VVHO can forbear, and tamely silent fit,</L>
<L>And see his Native Land undone by Wit?</L>
<L>Boast not, <HI>Britannia,</HI> of thy happy Peace,</L>
<L>What if Campaigns and Sea-Engagements cease,</L>
<L>Wit, a worse Plague, does mightily encrease?</L>
<L>Some monstrous Crimes to Ages past unknown,</L>
<L>Have surely pull'd this heavy Judgment down.</L>
<L>Fierce Insect-Wits draw out their noisy Swarms,</L>
<L>And threaten Ruin more than Foreign Arms.</L>
<L>O'er all the Land the hungry Locusts spread,</L>
<L>Gnaw every Plant, taint every flowry Bed,</L>
<L>And crop each tender Virtue's tender Head.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How happy were the old unpolished Times,</L>
<L>As free from Wit as other modern Crimes?</L>
<L>As our Forefathers Vig'rous were and Brave;</L>
<L>So they were Virtuous, Wise, Discreet and Grave,</L>
<L>Detesting both alike the Wit and Knave.</L>
<L>They justly Wits and Fools believ'd the same,</L>
<L>And Jester was for both the common Name.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="3">Their Minds for Empire form'd would never quit</L>
<L>Their noble Roughness, and dissolve in Wit.</L>
<L>For Business born and bred to Martial Toil.</L>
<L>They rais'd the Glory of <HI>Britannia</HI>'s Isle.</L>
<L>Then she her dreadful Ensigns did advance,</L>
<L>To curb <HI>Iberia,</HI> and to conquer <HI>France.</HI></L>
<L>But this degenerate, loose and foolish Race</L>
<L>Are all turn'd Wits, and their great Stock debase.</L>
<L>Our Learning daily sinks, and Wit is grown</L>
<L>The senseless Conversation of the Town.</L>
<L>Enervated with this our Youth have <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 word"></L>
<L>That stubborn Virtue, which we once could boast.</L>
<L>The Plague of Wit prevails, I fear 'tis vain</L>
<L>Now to attempt its Fury to restrain.</L>
<L>It takes Men in the Head, and in the Fit</L>
<L>They lose their Senses, and are gone in Wit.</L>
<L>By various ways their Frenzy they express,</L>
<L>Some with loose Lines run haring to the Press,</L>
<L>In Lewdness some are Wits, some only Wits in Dress.</L>
<L>Some seiz'd like <HI>Gravar,</HI> with Convulsions strain</L>
<L>Always to say fine Things, but strive in vain,</L>
<L>Urg'd with a dry <HI>Tenesmus</HI> of the Brain.</L>
</LG>

<L>Had but the People scar'd with Danger run</L>
<L>To shut up <HI>Wills,</HI> where first this Plague begun:</L>
<L>Had they the first infected Men convey'd</L>
<L>Strait to <HI>Moorfields,</HI> the Pest-house for the Head;</L>
<L>The wild Contagion might have been supprest,</L>
<L>Some few had fal'n, but we had sav'd the rest.</L>
<L>An Act like this had been a good Defence</L>
<L>Against our great Mortality of Sense.</L>
<L>But now th' Infection spreads, the Bills run high,</L>
<L>At the last Gasp of Sense ten thousand dy.</L>

<L>Pity that so much Labour should be lost</L>
<L>By such a healthful Constitution crost.</L>

<L>Still his strong Nature works the Poison off.</L>
<L>He still escapes, but yet is wondrous pleas'd</L>

<L>So Hypocrites in Vice in this vile Town</L>
<L>To Wickedness pretend, that's not their own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A Bantring Spirit has our Men possest,</L>
<L>And Wisdom is become a standing Jest.</L>
<L>Wit does of Virtue sure Destruction make;</L>
<L>Who can produce a Wit and not a Rake?</L>
<L>Wise Magistrates leud Wit do therefore hate,</L>
<L>The Bane of Virtue's Treason to the State.</L>
<L>While Honour fails and Honesty decays,</L>
<L>In vain we beat our Heads for Means and Ways</L>
<L>What well-form'd Government or State can last,</L>
<L>When Wit has laid the Peoples Virtue wast?</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="4" MS="y">The <HI>Mob</HI> of Wits is up to storm the Town,</L>
<L>To pull all Virtue and right Reason down.</L>
<L>Quite to subvert Religion's sacred Fence,</L>
<L>To set up Wit, and pull down common Sense.</L>
<L>Our Libraries they gut, and shouting bear</L>
<L>The Spoils of ruin'd Churches in the Air.</L>
<L>Their Captain <HI>Tom</HI> does at their Head appear,</L>
<L>And <HI>S&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> in his Gown brings up the Rear.</L>
<L>Aloud the Church and Clergy they condemn,</L>
<L>Curse all their Order, and their God blaspheme.</L>
<L>Against all Springs of Learning they declare,</L>
<L>Against Religion's Nurseries, and swear</L>
<L>They will no <HI>All&mdash;e, M&mdash;ll</HI> or <HI>Ch&mdash;t</HI> spare:</L>
<L>But the leud Crew affirm by all that's good</L>
<L>They'll ne'er disperse unless they've <HI>B&mdash;ly</HI>'s Blood.</L>
<L>For that ill-natur'd Critic has undone</L>
<L>The rarest Piece of Wit that e'er was shown.</L>
<L>Till his rude Stroaks had thresh'd the empty Sheaf,</L>
<L>We thought there had been something else than Chaff.</L>
<L>Crown'd with Applause this Master Critic sits,</L>
<L>And round him ly the Spoils of ruin'd Wits.</L>
<L>How great a Man! What Rev'rence were his due,</L>
<L>Could he suppress the Critic's <HI>Fastus</HI> too?</L>
<L>As certain Words will Lunaticks enrage,</L>
<L>Who just before appear'd sedate and sage.</L>
<L>So do but <HI>Lock</HI> or <HI>Books</HI> or <HI>Bentley</HI> name,</L>
<L>The Wit's in clammy Sweats, or in a Flame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Horror and Shame! What would the Madmen have?</L>
<L>They dig up learned <HI>Bernard</HI>'s peaceful Grave.</L>
<L>The Sacred-Urn of famous <HI>Stilling fleet,</HI></L>
<L>We see prophan'd by the leud Sons of Wit.</L>
<L>The skilful <HI>Ty&mdash;n</HI>'s Name they dare invade,</L>
<L>And yet they are undone without his Aid.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="4" MS="y"><HI>Ty&mdash;n</HI> with base Reproaches they pursue,</L>
<L>Just as his <HI>Moorfields</HI> Patients use to do.</L>
<L>For next to Virtue, Learning they abhor,</L>
<L>Laugh at Discretion, but at Business more.</L>
<L>A Wit's an idle, wretched Fool of Parts,</L>
<L>That hates all Liberal and Mechanick Arts.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wit does enfeeble and debauch the Mind,</L>
<L>Before to Business or to Arts inclin'd.</L>
<L>How useless is a fauntring empty Wit,</L>
<L>Only to please with Jests at Dinner fit?</L>
<L>What hopeful Youths for Bar and Bench design'd,</L>
<L>Seduc'd by Wit have learned <HI>Coke</HI> declin'd?</L>
<L>For what has Wit to do with Sense or Law?</L>
<L>Can that in Titles find or mend a Flaw?</L>
<L>Can Wit supply great <HI>T&mdash;by</HI>'s nervous Sense?</L>
<L>Or <HI>S&mdash;r</HI>'s more than <HI>Roman</HI> Eloquence?</L>
<L>Which way has <HI>H&mdash;lt</HI> gain'd Universal Fame?</L>
<L>What makes the World thy Praises, <HI>F&mdash;ch,</HI> proclaim?</L>
<L>And charming <HI>P&mdash;s</HI> what advanc'd thy Name?</L>
<L>'Twas Application, Knowledge of the Laws,</L>
<L>And your vast Fund of Sense, gain'd you Applause.</L>
<L>The Law will ne'er support the bant'ring Breed,</L>
<L>A <HI>Sl&mdash;</HI> may sometimes there, but Wits can ne'er succeed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>R&mdash;t&mdash;ffe</HI> has Wit, and lavishes away</L>
<L>More in his Conversation every Day,</L>
<L>Than would supply a modern Writer's Play.</L>
<L>But 'tis not that, but the great Master's Skill,</L>
<L>Who with more Ease can cure, than <HI>C&mdash;h</HI> kill,</L>
<L>That does the grateful Realm with his Applauses fill.</L>
</LG>

<L>Thy Learning <HI>G&mdash;ns,</HI> and thy Judgment <HI>H&mdash;w,</HI></L>
<L>Make you in envy'd Reputation grow.</L>

<L>Ill-natur'd, Arrogant, and very Poor.</L>
<L>But let Invectives still your Names assail,</L>
<L>Your Business is to Cure, and theirs to Rail.</L>
<L>Let 'em proceed and make your Names a Sport</L>
<L>In leud Lampoons, they've Time and Leisure for't.</L>

<L>From threaten'd Death will bless You all their Days,</L>
<L>And spend the Breath you sav'd, in just and lasting Praise.</L>

<LG>
<L>Wit does our Schools and Colleges invade,</L>
<L>And has of Letters vast Destruction made.</L>
<L>Has laid the Muses choicest Gardens wast,</L>
<L>Broke their Inclosures and their Groves defac't.</L>
<L>We strive in Jests each other to exceed,</L>
<L>And shall e'er long forget to Write or Read.</L>
<L>Unless a Fund were settled once that cou'd</L>
<L>Make our deficient Sense and Learning good,</L>
<L>Nothing can be expected, for the Debt</L>
<L>By this loose Age contracted, is so great,</L>
<L>To set the Muses mortgag'd Acres free,</L>

<L>Let these be made the Masters of Essay,</L>
<L>They'll every Piece of Metal touch and weigh,</L>
<L>And tell which is too light, which has too much Allay.</L>
<L>'Tis true, that when the course and worthless Dross</L>
<L>Is purg'd away, there will be mighty Loss.</L>
<L>Ev'n <HI>C&mdash;e, S&mdash;n, Manly W&mdash;ly,</HI></L>

<L>The Muses learned Commerce to maintain?</L>
<L>How pensive will our Beaus and Ladies sit?</L>

<L>That such a failure no Man may incense,</L>

<L>The Man's a sort of Wit too in his way.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let 'em receive whatever <HI>P&mdash;r</HI> brings,</L>
<L>In nobler Strains no happy Genius sings.</L>

<L><HI>T&mdash;e</HI> will subscribe, but set no Payment-Day,</L>

<L>Therefore let Satyr-Writers be supprest,</L>
<L>Or be reform'd by cautious <HI>D&mdash;set</HI>'s Test.</L>
<L>'Tis only <HI>D&mdash;set</HI>'s Judgment can command,</L>
<L>Wit the worst Weapon in a Madman's Hand.</L>
<L>The Biting Things by that great Master said,</L>
<L>Flow from rich Sense, but theirs from want of Bread.</L>
<L>Whatever is by them in Satyr writ</L>
<L>Is Malice all, but his excess of Wit.</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="8" MS="y">To lash our Faults and Follies is his Aim,</L>
<L>Theirs is good Sense and Merit to defame.</L>
<L>In <HI>D&mdash;set</HI> Wit (and therefore still 'twill please)</L>
<L>Is Constitution, but in them Disease.</L>

<L>Care should be taken of the Impotent,</L>
<L>That in your Service have their Vigor spent.</L>
<L>They should have Pensions from the Muses State,</L>
<L>Too Old to Write, too Feeble to Translate.</L>
<L>But let the lusty Beggar-Wits that lurk</L>
<L>About the Hill, be seiz'd and set to Work.</L>
<L>Besides some Youths Debauches will commit,</L>
<L>And surfeit by their undigested Wit.</L>
<L>Th' intoxicating Draught they cannot bear,</L>
<L>It takes their Heads before they are aware.</L>
<L>Weak Brothers by Excesses it appears</L>
<L>Have oft been laid up Months, and some whole Years.</L>
<L>By one Debauch a tender Wit was try'd,</L>
<L>And he 'tis known was likely to have dy'd.</L>
<L>That neither Sick nor Poor you may neglect,</L>
<L>For all the Muses <HI>Invalids</HI> erect,</L>
<L>An Hospital upon <HI>Parnassus</HI> Hill,</L>
<L>And settle Doctors there of Worth and Skill.</L>
<L>This Town can numbers for your Service spare,</L>
<L>That live obscure and of Success despair.</L>
<L><HI>Fracar</HI> has many sour Invectives said,</L>
<L>And Jests upon his own Profession spred,</L>
<L>And with good Reason, 'twill not find him Bread.</L>
<L>And some such Doctors, sure you may persuade</L>
<L>To labour at th' Apothecary's Trade.</L>
<L>They'll Med'cines make, and at the Mortar sweat,</L>
<L>Let 'em pound Drugs, they have no Brains to beat.</L>
