<HEAD>THE DISCOVERY OF THE Knights of the Poste.</HEAD>
<P>_AS I traveiled towardes <HI>Plimmoth,</HI> this last voyage, vpon my well approued hac|ney, (ould Bayard of tentors) it was my goodlucke a little on this side <HI>Hounslowe,</HI> (iust vpon the heath, where that villaine was hanged in chaines, that murdered the maiden in the wood) to overtake a wel trust fellow mounted vpon as proper an nagge as my own, but not altogether so well paced: At what time I bad him good morrow, good morrow (quoth he:) God graunt it prove so, but as I spe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">de, so will I praise the day: why sir (said I) then well overtaken, I trust my greeting deserves noe grudge. In deeds (quoth he) well ouertaken but ill found. I musing at the man what he meant by these quibs, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> him how so? Because (said he) my purse is as empty as my belly, and yet my stomacke as good as yours. I tolde him that matter would be soone amended, if he wanted pence, to leaue a pawne for his breakfast: The man hearing me say so: answered, my counsaile was better then my charity, and yet (quoth he) your charity may be better then my pawne: for I assure you, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> suppose you have more to giue, then I have to gage: and yet yesterday, I had as much money as would fill a quart potte, if my wisedome had boene so good to keepe it: Certainly (said I) he that would spend so prodi|gally, and so much in one day, without any regard, in my opinion is worthy so fast the next day without pitty: So sir,
<PB REF="3">
I have your iudgement already (quoth he:) it is pitty you should be made a Iustice of peace, that can examine a cause no better: If you had asked me how I had spent so much money in so short a time, and how much the sum had b&eacute;ene, you had shewen some wit: but to pronounce me prodigall at the first dash, for so trifling a cause, argues in deede a man of smnall discretion. Why qd. he, is not he to be blamde, &amp; coun|ted a thristlesse waster, that spends the quantity of a quart of money at one day: if you had gamde it away, it had b&eacute;ene an+other matter, because I know it a thing soone done, and you not so much to be blamed: for that a man cannot commaund the dice as he may his dogge, to say, sira fetch me the same againe? Alasse qd. he, how simple of understanding are you, iust as wise as Winefred my wife, that when I wisht her to arme her selfe against her vnquiet neighbours, presently clapt a co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">slet on her backe, and so ran among them: You come in with a quart full of money, and I toulde you of as much money as filde a quart, which God wot was but one penny for the which I had a quart of ale at <HI>Colbrooke.</HI></P>
<P>O was it so, I crie you mercy qd. I, and because I haue made you this offence, I will paye for your breakefast at <HI>Staines,</HI> which now is not farre off: and I pray you let me request to knowe how farre you trauell this way: Mary sir qd he, euen as farre as I would wish your company, fin|ding you alwaies thus kinde : but indeede my iourney is to <HI>Plimmoth,</HI> if I knew how to get thither, with that we went into our Inne at the signe of the Ale-stake, where I calde in for bread and cheese, &amp; y^e best b&eacute;ere they had in the house: This is well done (qd. he) call you in for that which is good, and I will haue a care it shall not be lost: and with that he claps a penny loafe in his pocket, and anone after he thrust another into his bosome: I demaunding why he did so: he answered, because (saith he) I would trie whether <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> bread at the next towne be as good as this or no: For me thinkes it hath a very good relish, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> I assure you it is good for a man to be experienced in such thinges, and still he fed upon bread
<PB REF="3">
and cheese as nimbly as a squerell on a nutte. I seeing him feede so hartely, said if his legs were as good as his stomacke he needed not to feare his journey to <HI>Plimmoth</HI>: so at length being well refresht, I tould him that according to my pro|mise I would pay for his breakfast, but he should pay for the two penny loaues in his pocket: By the masse (quoth he) I am perswaded your purse is better linde then mine, not w^t|standing if my credit be better than yours, w^t this my wel|faire hoastice, I am content to passe my word for it rather. wife you are like to pay all for me.</P>
<P>The woman hearing him flout at her face, was straight inflamed as if she had b&eacute;ene made of tuchwood, and wholy compact of a lump of gunpowder: Why thou paultry knau? (qd she) what ailes my face&punc; what canst y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> say to my face? or what doest thou s&eacute;e in my face? For soule my face, I hope my face is a christian bodies face, thou scuruy iacke, I te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l thoe I am not ashamed to shew my face. I thinke so (qd he) for it is of as good scarlet vie, as euer I saw any in my daies: but say, will you take my word for two pence? Take thy word? He soe thoe hangd first (qd she) pay me my money, or by Gods body Ile have you set by the heeles: and with that she tooke by her distasse and beate him out of dores: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> I seeing was glad to content her, and so we parted from y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> place. I would (quoth he) euery hoastice would giue me such a pasport as my hoastice of <HI>Staines</HI>: then would I not doubt but to come to my iourneies end, with virtuals inoughe in my paunche, and no hurt to my person.</P>
<P>Thus we went on our way, hauing worke sufficient to coment on this controuersie, even till we came to <HI>Basing|stoke,</HI> where with the suns setting we tooke vp our lodging, and with the beginning of the euening ended our daies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. Now (qd my mery companion) to requite your curtesie for my dinner, find you meate and drinke, and I will find bread to supper. And so if I finde to morrow as happy as this day hath beene to me, I shalbe well pleased to heare you againe to salute me with good morrow; otherwise the day shal haue

my fauour to my fortune. And with that as mery as a man with two penny loaues in his pocket, he steps into a tipling house and askt for lodging, he was no sooner come into the house, but there was one clad like a Caualier of <HI>Spaine,</HI> that tooke acquaintance of him, saying: What <HI>Goodcoll</HI> my old friend, my companion and familiar acquaintance, wel met, I am glad to see thoe in health: ho Lapster fill vs a dosen of beere, for weele be mery yfaith: with that my companion was wonderous iocond, and gratifying him with all the reuerence he could deuise, with Italian and French im<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> bracements, sometimes about the middle, sometimes below the knees: he required his greeting in this sort: Iacke Free|man, A plague on th&eacute;e, who would haue thought to haue found th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e here&punc; trust me by the faith of an honest man, I am glad of this chance: And in respect of this happy mee|ting, I blesse my fortunate starres that it was my lucke to s&eacute;e th&eacute;e before I die: And as thou louest me, bid this my friend welcome and let us suppe together: but Iacke Free|man except your purse be better then mine, our ch&eacute;ere will but mocke our stomackes, which at this time I should take in as ill part, as my hoastice of <HI>Staines</HI> did my words this morning. Tush feare not (qd. <HI>Freeman</HI>) if thou hast no mo|ney, I haue enough both for me and th&eacute;e, and yfaith thou shalt not lacke as long as forty pounds last: why man I thank<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> God I haue in this simple doublet (as I may say to th&eacute;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> an hundred angels and upward, and hang dogs. <HI>Good|co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l</HI> they shall be all at thy command. Godamercy my sw&eacute;ete <HI>Iacke Freeman</HI> (qd. he:) And with that we all sate downe to supper: At what time they fell into great communication y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> one with the other. <HI>Freeman</HI> declared how he was newely come out of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and what hurt the rebels had don there, by setting diuers townes on fire, and now (qd he) I am come from visiting my friends in <HI>Hampshire,</HI> with purpose to go directly to London. Therfore I pray th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e tell me how doth all our good friends there, and what is the best newes. In troth (qd. <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">odcoll</HI>) no newes but what is common: The
<PB REF="4">
good Earle of <HI>Essex</HI> is prepared to sea, and in sooth thither am I going to: for what with my debts, and my wiucs tongue (before god) I am constrained to leaue all, for who would liue in bread of those creepe corners, that gets their liuing by playing boe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p&eacute;epe, who like the cookcow have neuer but one song, and that sounds so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> fauouredly, saying: I arest you: that I promise you it makes many a mans heart ake that heares it. And whither I pray you trauels this honest man your friend (qd. he:) Truly (said I) my iourney is toward y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> sea too, though not for the like cause as my friend goes. For as for my wife, her tongue did neuer displease me, because she could neuer speake being borne dumb, and as for Serge|ants, I neuer neede to teare them, for no man would euer credite me to make me run in debt. Then hast thou (qd. <HI>Free|man</HI>) two good commodities. But hearest thou <HI>Goodcoll,</HI> I pray thee say: how doe all our ancient acquaintance, y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> good oath-takers, or common baylers:
<HI>Alias</HI> the knightes of the Poste, the Lords of sobs pound, and heires apparant to the pillory: who are as ready to baile men out of prison, being then well pleased for their paines, as <HI>Tiron</HI> is in playing the traitour without causes. Tush (qnoth <HI>Goodcoll</HI>) that fraternity of falsehood, and fellowship of fraud, both neuer lightly passe out of the old byas, they are all in health, though voide of honesty: some are at liberty to s&eacute;eke a dinner where they can get it: and some to spare shoe-leather lies in prison. L. that old lad is foorth comming, though not co~ming foorth, hauing the priuiledge to walke his stations in one of y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> coun|ters in London, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> so are diuers other of the same profession. But tell me I pray you (qd. <HI>Freeman</HI>) what is become of B. is he as sound mettle as he was: And how doth the harber of new corne, olde Father C to-towne, L. the Courier, and he whom men call worse then Craft, are they all liuing stil? Liuing (qd. <HI>Goodcoll</HI>) trust me I, and like enough to liue till shame either prefers them to the pillory, or misery ende their daies. B. hath sou~ded false larums in Westminster hall a long time, and hath been a graund <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">night of antiquity: as
<PB REF="5">
well knowne for his profession, as mother Bunches ale to nipitaty. But for the store houses of corne, he hath beta|ken himselfe to his beades: for in matters of bailing, he is like an old horse, whose marke is neere worne out of his mouth: but notwithstanding though he be f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eble in body, yet his minde is as good as euer it was, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that which he cannot performe himselfe, he procures others to doe: like that aun|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iente raine beaten harlot M, Ro, that after thee had quite consumed her young yerea in lechery, and was no more set by, yet for the loue she bore to the whorish art, procured and inticed younger ones to doe it, and so became a notable baude. And in like sort playeth he, for where he bayleth one himselfe, he procureth others to baile throe.</P>
<P>But as concerning olde father C: why man hee is oulde suresby, as trustie as steele, and one that alwaies helpes at a deadlift: for after he hath smugd vppe himselfe in his bor|rowed apparell, with his great seale ring on his finger of pure copper and guilt, when he comes to baile a man before a Iudge, being demaunded if hee be a subsidie man or no, straight answeres, and it shall please your good Lordshippe, I have beene a subsidy man this xx. Winters and vpward: And then he sweares, that he was seized at v. pounds in the Queenes bookes the last sessment of the subsidie: and furder affirmes it on his credit, which is as good in r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eapside, as it is at the pudding<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y house, where they will not trust him for two pence: but he hath one bad quality, which I doubt will make him at length loose his customers, and that is this. He will neuer be pleased when he hath bailed one, except he give him more then his promise and beside stop his mouth with a pint of old sack. Now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> he whom men call worse then craft and L. I think they will giue ouer their trade of bailing, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> turne truemen, for they doe not so much vse it as they haue done heretofore. Trust me (qd. <HI>Freeman</HI>) that would be as great a miracle, as to see <HI>Bankes</HI> his curtaile dance a h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rnt|pipe. But what say you to little W, and to him that is called more then a whole bare ow, and the man whose name hath but fine letters, first thr&eacute;e vowels, then two consonants?
<PB REF="5">
But (qd <HI>Goodcol</HI>) they be in these matters like. Manering at a buriall, of no reckoning, except to iest at: being rather procurers of others then doers themselves. If you make no account of them (qd <HI>Freeman</HI>) what say you then of him that bore the name of the olde player with the beluct cap: of the aged Crane turnde backewarde, <HI>K.</HI> with the tun, &amp; <HI>F.</HI> w^t the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rie face, <HI>C.</HI> the true cook olde y^e sold away his wife for mo|ney, &amp; afterwardes receiued her home againe: mary qd.

<PB REF="6">
But then I pray you tell me what is become of the broker, the bird with the blacke foote and goulden taile, and the son of <HI>R.</HI> doe they continue their oulde courses still? What n&eacute;ede you moue such a question (qd. <HI>Goodcoll</HI>) how should they liue if they should leaue that sweete profitable trade: bayling and swearing&punc; I tell you sir it is an occupation that foules not their hands, though it corrupt their consci|ence, which some of them haue vsed these dozen or fourt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne yeres at the least. I muse (qd. <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eeman</HI>) hold these fellowes scape vntaken or vnpunisht all this while, for it is on oulde prouerbe, that the pitcher goes so long to the water, that at length it comes broken home. Tush they are as h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eful in this matter as may be, for as I tould you, they will seldome tell their right names, nor giue true notice of their dwelling: And beside that they will be sure to know before hand, what Iudge it is that must take the baile: for if their be any iudge that he knowes doth suspect him, he will k&eacute;epe one leg back from that place, and go before some other to doe the feat.</P>
<P>Call you these feates (qd <HI>Freeman</HI>) for wretches to per|iure themselues in this sort? truely god may well spare them for a time, but their iudgement wil be the greater: and sure|ly goods gotten in this sort must n&eacute;edes be cursed: And no maruell if none of them doe thriue. Why doe you say so (qd. <HI>Goodcole</HI>) is not the broker rich<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> I, but he got it by broke|ry and not by bailing qd the other. I graunt he is a broker (qd. <HI>Freeman</HI>) but he was first a bailer and a swearer, which preferd him to his brokery: for it was a small matter inst&eacute;ed of hearing morning praier to goe fasting before a I. and forsweare himselfe, wherby he hath gotten many a crowne, which hee accompteth cl&eacute;ere gaines and the stocke remai|ning whole at the y&eacute;eres ende: so that nowe hee hath lefte brokery and is become a Draper. A Draper (quoth. <HI>Free|man</HI>) what Draper, of woollin or linnen&punc; No (qd he) an Ale Draper, wherein he hath more skil then in the other: neuer|thelesse there are more brokers that are bailers beside him. Why is their owne trade of brokery so much decayed (quoth <HI>Freeman</HI>) that they cannot liue by that, as well as they haue
<PB REF="6">
done I (qd <HI>Goodcoll</HI>) there is so many of them, that one ca|not liue by another: And beside that, there is another incon|uenience besa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e them: they must nowe neither buy any thing, nor take pawne, except first they come and register it in a place prouided by the Daiestrats: so that whereas be|fore they were wont to buy much stolne goods, whereby their greatest profit grew: now they cannot doe so, because each party that brings goods to the brokers, must haue their names &amp; dwelling place set downe by the Register, or else they that doe otherwise, are accounted a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cessary to the fello|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, if they meddle with any frolne goods.</P>
<P>This is an excellent good order qd. <HI>Freeman.</HI> But what is that sonne of <HI>R.</HI> you spoke of&punc; I haue heard much speeche of him that he hath b&eacute;ene an notable fellow for bailing. No <HI>Goodcoll</HI> and so he is still: but in speaking of him, I must say to you, as once a king of England said to his Nueene y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was desirous to know a certaine matter of him: soft (qd he) thereby hanges a tale: and so likewise of <HI>R.</HI> remaines ano|ther, but that I will referre till tomorrow, for what with this good supper, and my weary iourney, I find my selfe well preparde for my bed, and therefore let us know what we hane to pay, that we may rise from the table, for I assure you my legs are wart as stiffe as an ould paire of bootes af|ter a nights drying. Then said <HI>Freeman,</HI> Do tapster whats to pay: fiue willings two pence (qd he) and you are welcome: with that I began to draw my purse, and <HI>Goodcoll</HI> went to his pocket: Pay soft my masters (said <HI>Freeman</HI>) heres not a penny for any of you to pay: nor will I offer a penny (quoth <HI>Goodcoll</HI>) but these, &amp; with that he set the two loaues which he pluckt out of his pocket on the board: this is an odde iest (quoth I) to set bread on the board after the meate is eaten, much like vnto her, that went not for the Phisition before she saw her husband dead vnder the table If you like not my offer (qd <HI>Goodcoll</HI>) I will keepe them till to morrow. Why <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ir qd. <HI>Freeman,</HI> it is written you should not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">are for the mor|row; tis true qd he, and because I will not care for tomor|row,

I prouide these loaves tonight. Then said I to <HI>Free|man,</HI> I beseech you fir accept of my money, otherwise you will charge your selfe too much: You shall not spend a far|thing (quoth he) nor should not if we were toegther this mo|nesh: And trust me my hearts, were it not for one thing I would walke along with you: but at Bristowe I did dis|burse an hundred angels, to the good man of the fryingpan on the Bridge, to haue it paide me at London, the fifteenth of I: nexte, or within seuen daies after the sight of his bill: But (said <HI>Goodcoll</HI>) who must pate it to you there&punc; Mary <HI>Phillipp Curtoise,</HI> a man sure enough quoth <HI>Freeman.</HI></P>
<P>I would to Christ said <HI>Goodcoll,</HI> we might haue had your company to <HI>Plimmoth,</HI> for I may say to you as to my friend, I haue not one penny in my purse, whatsoeuer come: quoth <HI>Freeman,</HI> thou shalt not lacke for money: And with that he drew his purse and gaue him ten shillings, saying: Would thee my ould friend,<NOTE PLACE="marg">vi-</NOTE> take this to helpe thee, and if I had more store of white money, I promise thee thou shouldest haue more, mary I thanke God I haue some charge about me, more then I meane to make any man priuy to: And to say the truth, I am loath to breake my gould, I haue left myselfe fiue shillings yet in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">luer, and that shall serue till I come to London: And with that he calde the goodman of y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> house, saying: Good my hoast prouide me a good bed, and a chamber with locke and key, for I haue charge about me.</P>
<P>Sir saith the hoast feare not, you shall lie safe I warrant you, if you had a thousand pound. Deare ye my hoast (quoth <HI>Freeman</HI>) I pray you vse my friends well, I may say to you they are honest men, and of good credit in London, though as you see they trudge thus a foote, as my selfe both. I tel you they haue reason for it my hoast, and so haue I too: &amp; harke re me, I pray you let them haue what they will call for, if they will not pay you, I will. I thanke you sir (quoth we) and so we departed to bed.</P>
<P>In the morning they rose early, and calling at <HI>Freemans</HI> chamber do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, thought to take their farewell of him: What

<P>But pardon me I beseech you, good master <HI>Freeman,</HI> the day weares, and I haue farre to go, therefore I cannot stand to tell out the rest: but at our next meeting in troth you shall knowe all: therfore let us paye our shotte and be wal|king.</P>

Well now to my tale quoth <HI>Goodcoll.</HI></P>
<P>I heard it tolde for a truth, that a certaine Gt. now dwel|ling on Saint Andrewes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ill, in the direct way toward Tyborne, being a good knight of the Post, and hauing lear|ned of <HI>Ro.</HI> and such other of that hatefull society, to deny their own names: vpon a time when he came before a iudge to baile a man: most knawishly named himselfe to be a cer|taine Upholster in London: a man that for his wealth and wisedome was of good account among his neighbours.</P>
<P><PB REF="8">The creditor making inquiery of his baile, and finding him by report to be very sufficient, was well content, so the matter rested till the terme: At what time the action being ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">de vpon, there came neither one nor other to make aun|swere.</P>
<P>At last by course of law an execution was like to be ser|ued vpon the surety. The honest Cittizen hearing of this matter, was not a little amazed: saith he to the Creditor, Sir you greatly mistake, I am not the man you meane, for I know no such man you speake off, nor was I euer baile in this court in my life. Why is not your name thus: qd, the Attourney your trade Upholstery, and dwell you not in such a place&punc; Yes indeede quoth the Cittizen: well then, except there be more of this name dwelling there, you are like to answere <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s (saide the Attourney. Tush said the Citti|zen, as well he might haue put in my childs name as mine, for any knowledge I had of this matter.</P>
<P>Thus was this honest man put to no small trouble be|fore he could cleare himselfe: while in the meane space the Glouer sate smiling in his sleeue, and caried away twenty or thirthy shillings for his paines.</P>
<P>Undoubtedly said I, he is a fellow of a filthy conscience: Conscience (qd <HI>Goodcoll</HI>:) I tell you their consciences are like chiuerell shin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, that will stretch euery way. But for all the Glouer is so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">unning, if he vse many of these feates, at length he will come to peepe through the pillory, and car|ry as many eares on his head as old Harry of P. gardine. But where is P. now a daies, that goulden feathered bird, he hath beene an ancient professor of bayling, &amp; many great aduentures hath he past, like a most hardy knight of the Post.</P>
<P>I saith <HI>Freeman,</HI> but he was like to haue catcht a foule soile of late: for if he had beene gotten, he had beene clapt vy in the kings bench for his knauery: And how scapt he I pray&punc; Cuen by his wittes said <HI>Goodcoll,</HI> the which he hath beaten thri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> bare.</P>

<P>An Officer ryding hard by him with a Iaueline in his hand, bearing him thus inuaye against his vnkinde friend, wisht him to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ontent himselfe with patience, for (quoth he) though he will not take the paines to goe with thee now, yet he meanes parhaps to follow thee, shortly.</P>
<P>It was well answerd to the discontented man (qd. <HI>Free|man</HI>) for the quyet of his minde, but how fares B.

<P>There is a most braue fellow but very newly crept into this crewe, and his name is <HI>N.</HI> well knowne, one that lookes very high, and at euery word casteth his eye aboue Powles steeple, as if he would quarrell with the Doone, or had some controuersie against the seauen starres. In his attire, he is neat and fine, and in his speech stately, with a long piccade|uant after the French cut, and of a scornefull countenance, and when he comes into Westm. hall, he bends his browes, as if he would beare downe the Kinges Bench barre with his lookes. My acquaintance with the man is but small, for I was neuer in his company but once, and that was at the kings head in Fleetstreete, at what time being (as it was supposed) in his holly day apparell, which was after the ma|ner of a Barchaunt, hee seemed to scorne that a poore man should speake to him.</P>
<P>Also at the same time as I wel remember <HI>P.</HI> the golden fe|thered bird was with him, very braue, with a faire cloake of somewhat a gray colour on his backe, the which (as it was folde me) <HI>N.</HI> had sent him for that d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, hauing bin as it see|med about their common profits that morning: and these two as I haue heard, haue ioyned the~selues together in ma|ny actions. There is also another new come fellow, whose name is <HI>S.</HI> he dwelt sometime about London bridge, &amp; nowe is gotten into Houndsditch to dwell, who seeming to be a ve|ry surly proud companion, &amp; falling at strife with his trade, gaue his occupation a pasport, to get a new master, and be|tooke himselfe to follow this honest fellowship, and both also take vpon him to doe many matters, making both of his a|bilitie and of the effectiug of many matters huge bragges, howsoeuer he deales in the performance thereof. Nowe sir, there is another of this newcome crewe, that by reporte is
<PB REF="9">
as worthy to be noted as the rest, whose name and nature may well agree.</P>
<P>Dee is called <HI>W.</HI> and you knowe beas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es of his name are great bloudsuckers, and it is to be feared, he will be as great a pursse-sucker, as the wolfe is a blood-sucker, if in time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> be not preuented.</P>
<P>And it came to passe that this <HI>W.</HI> not long since, &amp; <HI>S.</HI> &amp; <HI>N.</HI> being before sworne brethren, and great companions toge|ther, on a time they with some other of the same sect, after their businesse at the hall in the morning was ended, finding their guts chyme twelue a clocke in their bellies, went all together to dinner in Westminster: where they fedde so heartily, and druncke so hard, that <HI>S.</HI> after dinner (while the others were busie in talking) fell asleepe, which when the rest perceiued, like most honest men of their profession, consulted among themselues, to steale away, and leaue him to pay the shot, whereupon one of them after another crept out of the roome, and came to the good man, saying, Sir we haue gathered our reckoning, and lefte our money with our friend aboue, who because hee was by this morning some|what early, breaking his ordinarie house, is purposed to take a nappe before he goes and as soone as he wakes he will pay you: for our owne partes we haue earnest busines that calleth vs hence, or else we woulde be loath to leaue him be|hind vs, and therefore we pray you take care of him, that no man doe offer him any wrong.</P>
<P>The good man deeming their abillitie to be answerable to their apparell, and noting them by their countenance to be ciuill Cittizens, with his cappe in his hande very mannerly, made this replie.</P>
<P>Uery well Gentlemen, I doubt not my payment, and doubt you not but I will haue good regard to the gentleman aboue: let him take his rest on Gods blessing: well, God be with you, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r qd. they: you are heartily welcome saide the Wintner: nowe sir within some quarter of an houre after, <HI>S.</HI> awaking out of sleepe, and seeing his companions to bee gone, maru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iled much thereat, wherefort hee calling the

<P>And as he went one way I came another with pur|pose

to bring you certaine newes of this matter, for such goulden hornes as he wore, did I neuer s&eacute;e in my life.

<P>In the morning the foot-post was soonest vp: who calling to the rest of his company: askt if they were almost ready to walke: but <HI>Free<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an</HI> had drunke so hard ouer night that he had no liste to rise so timely in the morning: &amp; as for <HI>Good|col</HI> his money was all gone and spent: therefore he woulde not goe before his good friend <HI>Freeman</HI>: for my owne part I woulde faine haue gone along with the foot-poste: but that <HI>Goodcoll</HI> did earnestly intreat me to the contrary: where|upon I stayd: &amp; at length <HI>Freeman</HI> rising he called straight for something to breakefast which was soone prepared (for he was still the Gentleman) so having something refresht our selves we rose from the boord: pay <HI>Goodcoll</HI> qd. <HI>Freeman</HI> lay out for me: I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">can lay out no more quoth <HI>Goodcoll</HI> but all: then <HI>Freeman</HI> willed m&eacute;e to lay downe for them both, which I did: and so taking our leaue of our hoast, w&eacute;e set forward on our iourney toward <HI>Shaftesbury.</HI></P>
<P>Whereupon trauailing by the way, we fell into our olde accustumed talke: and amongst many other things': <HI>Good|coll</HI> there told us that the Kn. of the poste were marueilous good companions when they had store of money: and howe commonly they would be sure alwayes to haue money be|fore hand of him that should vse the~ though they did nothing.</P>
<P>Then said <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">reeman</HI> to <HI>Goodcoll</HI> I had forgot to aske you one question yesterday: &amp; Indeede the foot-post did breake off

<P>I pray you tell me, where are any of these Kn. of the post at any time to be founde; if y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a man shoulde happen to haue n&eacute;ede of them&punc; Truly, I assure you (quoth Goodcole) if it be in the tearme time, you may haue them most commonly in Fl&eacute;etstr&eacute;ete, about S.

But if it be out of tearme time: you shall haue them commonly, once or twice a day, walking in D.
