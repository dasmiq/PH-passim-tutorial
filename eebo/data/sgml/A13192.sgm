<HEAD>A preface to t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Chri|stian Reader.</HEAD>
<P>_IN perusinge the con|trouersies of these times (good Christian Reader) with a minde desirous af|terwarde to satisfie the ho|nest Christian, in some questions, (wherein with|out question, wee are mis|taken, and are not accor|dinge to right, rightlye vn|derstoode) in perusinge these controuersies, I saye (to speake a plaine truth as in the sight of God) I founde them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n both sides soe full of inuectiue dis|courses,
<PB REF="9">
as I was then so|rie to reade, and am now loath to mention. But a|mongest other enteringe in|to the controuersie of the holy Sacrament, mee thought I was entred into a tempestuous Sea of all contention, for there I sawe most vnnaturall bitternesse amongest Christians, scismes in the church, fac|tions in common wealthes, all tossinge, and turmoyling about this sacred misterie, as is wonderfull to consi|der.</P>
<P N="2">2 I beganne at first to admire the patience of God, to see this heauenlye
<PB REF="9">
league of humane saluati|on, least vnto the worlde, by him who did redeeme the worlde, as a seale of mercie, as a pledge of peace and loue beetweene God, and man, to beecome by the contentious humors of manye a verye subiecte for all dissention.</P>

<P N="4">4 In that allmighty God put emnitie beetweene the seede of the woman and the seede of the serpent&punc; wee may gather, that as the seede of the woman should bee at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nitie with the seede of the serpent, soe should it bee at vnitie with it selfe.

<P>There is a farre better, and safer course then to contend anie longer, if men woulde at last sette them selues on all partes to fol|lowe it, which is, to reue|rence the sonne of God in the vnsearchable misteries of his wisdome which are past finding out; and not to stande weigheinge them in the light scales and bal|lance of theire own reason, to drawe a vaile ouer them, or say with the wo|man of <HI>Samaria Puteus est altus: this well is deepe</HI></P>

In a worde, they who will needes sette downe a manner howe Christ is present in the Sacrament, or they whoe acknowledge his presence there after a manner ex|plicable. 15 All this while our due estimation of this so high a misterie is not fully vnderstood (as I suppose) of manie, who refuse our Christian assemblies in times beeseeming.

state of the controuersie it selfe is laide downe at the end in a breife admonition to the godly Reader, which admonition (some speciall reasons mouing me there|vnto) I haue written in the latine tongue, vnto which I referre the learned: but cheefely I commend vnto euerie honest Christian in generall, the tracte it selfe, which onelye tendeth to deuotion.

<P N="5">5 In the 14. and 16. of <HI>Exodus,</HI> God gaue the peo|ple of <HI>Israell</HI> for the time of theire abode in the wilder|nesse Manna from heauen, which manna, they gathered vntill they came vnto the lande of promise: in like manner, soe longe as wee remaine in the wildernesse of this worlde; wee are gathe|ringe

<P N="6">6 Christ our Sauiour when the time drewe neere that hee should bee betrayed and deliuered vp vnto death, hee communeth with his disciples after this manner <HI>Luk:</HI> 22.15. I haue earnestly desired to eate this passeouer with you before I suffer; In consecrating the elementes of breade and wine, his prai|ers went vp to heauen, his benefites remaine with his church heere on earth, the visible signes which hee tooke, and gaue declare two thinges, the one that hee would the morrow follow|inge make himselfe an obla|tion for the redemption of

<P N="2">2 In the feastes of the world there is variety, and by how much the more the va|rietie is the greater, by so much the more is the feast commended: in this spiritual banquet it is not so, wherein Christ being infinite contai|neth in him all perfection and can alone satisfie the soule.</P>
<P N="3">3 In the feastes of the world there is little speach had of death, suffering afflic|tion, and tribulations, rather

<HEAD>The manifold effectes and fruites of this holy Sacra|ment.</HEAD>
<P>WEe may remember, which we cannot for|get, that as man con|sisteth of soule and bodie, so doth he also leade a two|fold life, the one temporall,
<PB N="44" REF="48">
readie to fall into a thousand dangers and casualties. The other spirituall, subiect to as many and more. The life of the body consisteth of the v|nion of the Soule with the body. The life of the soule consisteth of another vnion, with grace in Christ. Both these, as they haue their de|fects and casualties, so haue they also their remedies and sustentations. For the life na+turall, God hath ordained naturall sustenance; for the life supernaturall, supernatu|rall nourishment, which is this most holy Sacrament. But that which at all times is most to bee lamented is, whereas the spirituall life is farre more excellent then the temporall, notwithstanding is more regarded and pre|ferred. For what thing doth
<PB N="45" REF="48">
not a sicke body doe, to re|couer his health, hee neglec|teth all charges and griefes, he esteemeth nothing of the bitternesse of Medecines, he contemneth the sharpnesse of paines: the most experi|enced Phisitions, the best preseruatiues are sought for, and all for bodily health, which endureth for a little time And are wee so carefull for the health of our Soule? would to God we were, then would we repaire with more deuotion&punc; vnto this most holy Sacrament, where our spirituall life is preserued and strengthened.</P>
<P>Three things there are sayth one, necessarie for the life of man, the mother which brings him forth, the meate which sustaineth him, and the Phisition that cures
<PB N="46" REF="49">
him when hee is sicke.</P>
<P>The same three are ne|cessarie for the life spirituall. The mother is Baptisme, the meate is the holy Eucharist, the Phisition to cure is re|pentance. Now then, as the body without meats cannot endure labours and liue, no more can the Soule without this spirituall repast, sustaine the labours of this Pilgri|mage, the assaults of her ene|mies and liue. The ayre be|ing corrupted when we goe forth of doores, wee fortefie vs with some preseruatiue. This world is corrupted, our preseruatiue against tempta|tions, is this holy Eucha|rist.</P>

<P>_THe first is, as wee may so speak to Deifie, that is, to make man di|uine, or like vn|to God himselfe, heere in the state of grace, and hereafter in the state of glory, and for this cause it is instituted in forme of nourishments.

It must be a Lambe without blemish, of a yeare old, it must be eaten at Ierusalem rosted, and in haste with wild Lettice, and sweet bread: those who shold eate thereof must haue their shooes on their feete, by
<PB N="205" REF="179">
which ceremony God signi|fied to the Iewes that they were strangers. Saint Chry|sostome in his 83. Homely vpon Mathew, applyeth in this manner that ceremonie vnto vs: If (saith hee) the Iewes about to go onely through Palestina, were fed with a Lambe after so curi|ous an order, with what vigi|lancie ought we to be fed in this Sacrament, with the true immaculate Lambe, which haue our iourney to heauen? do eate thereof in his church, heat with charitie, going for|ward to our land of rest, in 15. of Leuit. God saith, you shall eate of the old fruit, vn|till the new come, so did his people of the old passeouer, the same day they were deli|uered from Egypt had wee deliueraunce from a worser

seruitude of the Pascall lamb a bone must not bee broken; those parts of this lambe are the faithful, as if it were from God <HI>sacrificate filium,</HI> sacri|fice my Sonne, <HI>Sinite hos a|bine,</HI> let these go Iohn 18.</P>
<P N="5">5 A Figure of this, was Manna, giuen to the people of Israel in the desert, Exo. 10.15. Saint Paul saith that the redde Sea was a figure of Baptisme, and Manna of this holy Sacrament, which Manna had these properties.</P>
<P>First although some ga|thered much, and others lesse yet there was one sufficient measure for all, so in this Sa|crament of the Lordes Sup|per there is no lesse vertue in the lest part thereof then in the whole.</P>
<P N="2">2 Manna might be gathe|red any day except the Sa|both,
<PB N="207" REF="180">
and when the sunne a|rose it vanished. So this ve|nerable Sacrament serueth vs vntill the euerlasting Sa|both of the life to come, and when the Son of glorie shall appeare, it shall then cease.</P>
<P N="3">3 Manna did giue taste of all kind according vnto the will of the eater. This Man|na hath sweetnesse vnto the faith of the faithfull recey|uers so and so disposed.</P>
<P N="4">4 Many of the Iewes were grieuously punished, for that they contemned Manna, say|ing our soule loathed this light meate. Numb. 21.5. So S&punc; Paul sheweth 1. Cor, 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. &amp; 30. That in his time many were weake and sick among the~, for that this most diuine Sacrament was dispised and many vnworthily communi|cated.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="208" REF="181">6 The sixt Figure was the Arke, for like as the Arke saith, Th. Aquinas was made of Shitim wood, Exod. 25.10. that is to say, of shining and pure cedar: so was this of the most pure bodie of the Sonne of God. Againe, the Arke was guilded within &amp; without, which may resemble the wisdom &amp; loue of Christ. Ther were 3. things in the ark of speciall note, The golden pot, the rod of Aaron, and the two tables of the law.</P>
<P>The golden pot contay|ning Manna may betoken the soule of Christ contay|ning the fulnesse of the dietie: The rod of Aaron his priest|ly power, the two tables, that he was the eternal lawmaker.</P>
<P>But the holy scripture ma|keth mention of two things principally concerning the
<PB N="209" REF="181">
Arke which do maruellously appeare in this Sacrament.</P>
<P>The one, that by the be|fite of the Arke the people were not onely preser|ued. but much pestered. The other, that God grie|uously punished those who vnworthily entreated this A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ke, or gaue not worthie reuerence vnto the same: we reade Samuel 1. &amp; 4. when the people of Israel in one warre against the Philistines had lost foure thousand men, they procured that the Arke was brought into their tents, hoping that by the presence thereof to obtaine the victo|rie. But the contrary happe|ned, for the Arke of God was taken by the enemie, and 30000. men perished of the host of Israel for their per|uerse&punc; life, and small pietie.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="182">The Philistines also which vnworthily handled the Ark setting it with their idolatrie so sharply were they puni|shed, but chiefly the men of Ashdod, as that the holy scripture saith, 1. Sam. 5. The hand of God was greeuous vpon them.</P>
<P N="7">7 A figure of this Sacra|ment was the meale of He|lizeus, 1. King. 4. when the prophet commaunded that certaine hearbes should bee sodde for the children of the prophets, they tasting them found that they were so bit|ter, that they cryed to Heli|zeus, O man of God death is in the pot? Wherefore the holy prophet cast meale into the pot, wherewith he tooke away the bitternes: So Christ by meale or bread of the Sa|crament taketh away the bit|ternesse
<PB N="211" REF="182">
of our afflictions, &amp; causeth that they bring vs life and not death.</P>
<P N="8">8 A figure of this most ho|ly institution was that great Passeouer which K. Hezechi|ah kept, 2. Chron. 30.17. whe~ he prayed for the people that God would be mercifull vn|to him, that prepared his hart to seeke the Lord God of his Fathers though hee were not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary, when he spake comfortably vnto the Leuits, &amp; the whole multitude kept the feast with great ioy. Our Hezechiah hath not onely praied for the purifying of his people, but hath sanctified them, spoken comfortably, kept a ioyfull passeouer, such as neuer was in Israel.</P>

<P>_FOr y^t the spiri|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uall Commu|nio~ also is pro|fitable vnto soules, it is ne|cessarie that wee enter into some consideration of the same, and therein obserue these circumstances.</P>
<P>First what it is, secondlie, after what meanes it may be vsed, thirdly, what profite we reape by it, fourthly, how ac|ceptable it is to God. For the first, wee must knowe that as the Sacramen|tall
<PB N="234" REF="120">
Communion, hath wor|thily the first place amongst all the spirituall exercises of a Christian life. So also, the spirituall Communion hath a very godly and diuine vse. When the deuout man (saith <HI>Gerson</HI>) doth euery day re|ceiue spiritually the body of his Redeemer, so often doth hee mystically communicate the mystery of Christs birth and passion&punc; is inflamed in his loue, and reuolued in his deuotion: so when wee re|ceiue Christ in affection and desire of minde (which the faithfull often should doe) this is called our spirituall Communion.</P>
<P>For the second, what com|moditie this bringeth to the Soule, wee may gather by the manifold effects thereof. For as hee which moued by
<PB N="235" REF="120">
the holy Gost beleeueth, sor|roweth for his sinnes, and by louing God, desireth to bee baptised, doth obtaine the grace of Baptisme, which de|sire of Baptisme is called by the Diuines, <HI>Baptisma spiri|tus,</HI> the Baptisme of the Spi|rit, so doth it also happen in this spirituall Communion.</P>
<P N="3">3 The third, howe wee reape profite by receiuing Christ into the holy desires of our Soule, it may be easily vnderstood by the increase of loue, While I was musing sayth the Prophet, the fire kindled. The eleuatio~ of the mind vnto God, doth take vs away from earthly affecti|ons, and carrie vs vnto him, on whom our desires are fixt</P>
<P N="4">4 How acceptable this is vnto God, wee all know, hee that accepted the in|tention
<PB N="236" REF="121">
of Abraham, and said vnto Salomon, because this was in thine heart, doth not onely accept of our good desires, to embrace him in the armes of our affection, hut also doth reward this de|sire as the deed done. But we are to consider, that we must not onely stay vpon the de|sire of our will, and receiue Christ spiritually, but wee must proceed farther, to re|ceiue him together, both spi|ritually and sacramentally. For it is not inough to fol|low Christ in our intention, but wee must also receiue him in this holy mysterie, wherein we shew reuerence vnto his blessed institution, and that wee are become his Temple, as the Apostle speaketh, 1. Cor. 6. wherfore that we may be partakers of
<PB N="237" REF="121">
so great a blessing, as is our vnion with Christ, wee may not omit this speciall part of our Christian duetie, which hee who will please God, and proceede to the perfection of a Christian life, must of|ten vse, that so hee may goe forward in all vertue and ho|linesse of life, yea, euen vnto the end.</P>

<P>For that I haue experience in my selfe when the time of com|municating is at hand, to be|thinke my selfe more and more carefully to abstaine, yea from the least sins. Con|trariwise when the time of communicating is farther off, I am not so collected in minde, I waxe also faint in deuotion, I am prone to vanities and trifles, and if no other profit should come vn|to

</SP>

<P>But I feare not a little least if I come too often to the Lords table I make shipwrack both of loue and feare, for that is wont to fall out by too often vse and familiaritie.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spirit.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yea rather the contrarie doth often fall out, for if of the often and familiar cu|stome and frequentation of the communion any imper|fection were therein coue|red there were iust cause to diminish our loue and feare towards him as it commeth to passe in humane thinges: But that thing is not so: for when hee is a certaine infi|nite sea of all perfection, by howe much one vseth this often familiraitie, by
<PB N="266" REF="137">
so much the more hee decla|reth his goodnes &amp; perfecti|ons, and causeth that loue, feare, and reuerence towards his diuine maiestie, do equal|lie increase.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mund.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let it be as it is, dayly experience tea|cheth that the often vse of a thing although the best doth breed contempt &amp; lothsom|nes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spir.</SPEAKER>
<P>But that is in things temporal, and in sensual plea|sures, but in spirituall delights (as Saint Gregorie hath well obserued) saciety doth breed a desire, for then the good|nesse of them are made kno|wen, and therefore by how much the more surely they are possessed, by so much the more ardently they are desi|red, whence the heauenly wisedome saith: They which eate me doe still hunger, and they which drinke me do still

thirst.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mund.</SPEAKER>
<P>But Saint Paule saith, Hee that eateth and drinketh vnworthily, eateth and drinketh his own dam|nation, but if thou commu|nicate often, it seemeth thou thinkest thy selfe woorthy, and is not this pride? Thou also dost vnworthily Com|municate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>As if to Communicate seldom, doth make a man worthie. It is not so. But heare mee, if thou calst him woorthie, whose perfection doth equall the worthines of this Sacrament, the~ no creature, although the holiest, yea, nor all creatures put together, were worthy of this Sacrament. And if such worthines were so necessary, none should co~municate, for that none can attaine perfec|tion equall to thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> sacrament. But neither that any be wor|thie

is it necessary, that he at|taine some excellent perfec|tion, or bee endued with rare vertues, for these are acqui|ted by the rare vertues of this sacrament, and frequenting therof. Therefore that a man be worthy according to that of the Apostle S. Paul, it is e|nough that hee bring that preparation wherwith God is contented, that is, that first he examine his conscience, bee sorry for his sins committed, humbly confesse them with a penite~t hart, &amp; with this pre|paration to come to the co~|munion is no pride.</P>

<P>But in the Pri|mitiue Church the feruent|nesse of Christians was great, which when it is not now in vs, it seemeth more safe to abstaine from often com|municating: for if it bee o|therwise it is in daunger that we come not so disposed to communicate as wee ought.

<SP>

<P>Yea the selfe same thing for that so great desire is wanting in vs ought to driue vs to frequent this wholsome

it is better to preuent infirmi|ty, then to cure it once con|tracted. Lastly, ther is a great difference between corporall medecines and this spirituall, for they only put away bodi|ly diseases, &amp; often with euil humors, take away the good also, but this bringeth to the soul, grace, strength, &amp; other heauenly gifts, and therefore these seldome, this often is to be vsed.

to it, and obey the will ther|of, without manifest and ap|parent ruine: knowest thou what it is to abstaine from the sacred Communion, for the obliquies of the world. No other thing then to bee ashamed, and to account it a reproach, if thou art a good Christian, and indued with vertue, wherefore &amp; worthily too, may Christ be ashamed to receiue thee into heauen.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mund.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I should often com|municate, I must repent of|ten, become a good example to others, keep me at home. Cast off al recreations, which were to take away all my li|bertie from mee, and so I should pine away and waxe old before my time,</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Al|though thou Communicate but once in a yeere, thou art bou~d to repent, to giue good
<PB N="277" REF="142">
exa~ple to others, neither art thou ignorant how great a sin it is to giue a scandall to others. And the often co~mu|nicating, doth not take away recreations, but doth allow the~, so they are lawfull &amp; ho|nest. In that thou sayst thy li|bertie is taken away, it is not true, for if thou dost thinke any thing forbidden lawfull vnto thee not Communica|ting, thou art deceiued, for whether thou communicate often or seldome, thou art bounde to abstaine from sins. He which for recreation offendeth his creator, looseth true liberty, when he maketh himselfe a seruant of sin, yea, he looseth true ioy, which springeth of a good consci|ence, &amp; this the foolish world doth not vnderstand.</P>

<P>To y^e receiuing of this most

holy Communion, it is re|quired that a man bee of a quiet minde, which cannot bee commonly brought to passe, for the aduersities and perturbations of this world, it is not conuenient therfore often to Communicate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spirit.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yea, rather the afflicti|ons of this world, and this wretched place of exile, ought to driue vs to co~mu|nicate often. For amongst the effects thereof, this one is mentioned, that it giueth strength in aduersitie, as the Prophet signifieth, when hee sayd. Thou hast prepared a Table in my sight against those that trouble me.</P>

<P>Howsoeuer the matter is, to say truth, I dare not come often to this heauenly table, by reason of my manifold imperfections that I often fall into.</P>

<P>It hath beene answered to this before, either thou desi|rest to bee deliuered from these euils, or not, if thou de|sirest to bee ridde of them,
<PB N="280" REF="144">
this most holy sacrament re|ceiued with due preparation, wil minister such strength, y^t thou mayst by little and lit|tle remooue them, as it is e|uident many haue done, who by the vse of this spirituall meate, of carnall haue beene made spirituall.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Munda.</SPEAKER>
<P>I yeeld to thy reasons, and would gladly communicate, but I feele no deuotion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spir.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perchance thou thinkst thou hast no deuotion, vnlesse thou shead forth teares, that is not absolutely necessarie, neither in these consisteth all deuotion. The teares of the heart may suffice. That is sorrow for thy sinnes past, and a purpose to preuent those to come. Moreouer hee is called deuout, which in all thinges conformeth himselfe to Gods will,
<PB N="281" REF="144">
wherefore I would not that thou shouldest therefore ab|staine, because teares and sighs are wanting, for these are not alwaies necessarie, God giueth them to whom he pleaseth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mund.</SPEAKER>
<P>To say what I think, and that I may confesse a truth&punc; thou hast plainely perswaded mee that it is better to communicate often, then to abstaine, but one thing yet remaineth, I am loath to acknowledge my sinnes,</P>

of the fruit of this diuine sa|crament, causeth that repen|tance seemeth troublesome vnto thee, and the whole pre|paration to the communion. Furthermore, businesses doe not hinder good works, the businesses of greater mome~t are to bee preferred before the lesse. There is time to dispatch earthly affayres in good order. When the Son of God standeth and knoc|keth at the doore of thy hart, open vnto him, let him not knocke in vaine.
