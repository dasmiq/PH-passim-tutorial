<HEAD>TO THE Right Honourable JOHN LORD <HI>LORN.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Impute it to my good Fortune, My Lord, that the first appearance of this Play was on a <HI>Wednesday</HI> in <HI>Lent</HI>; for then (it seems) the Town look for a bad Entertainment, and if they met with any thing they did not expect; it was a disappointment that, I presume; they'll forgive.</P>
<P>I confess it has succeeded beyond my Expectation, since I understand that Your Lordship also has been plea|sed to speak in it's Favour. But You did not apprehend what You drew upon Your Self when you was doing so, and little thought, from commending the Brat, to have it laid at Your Door.</P>
<P>But tho' your approbation in Publick makes me proud, yet the delicacy of your Judgment in private keeps me humble; your Understanding discovers all faults, but your good breeding will not let you take Notice of any, and you can discourage no body, but when they attempt to imitate you.</P>
<P>If I had oftener had the honour to have been near your Lordship; the Conversation of the Comedy wou'd have discover'd it; and tho' it be my misfortune to be
<PB REF="3">
almost a stranger to your Person. Yet I may safely affirm, that I am throughly acquainted with your Character, and to speak but truth of you, wou'd look too like a De|dication.</P>
<P>I might inlarge upon the Antiquity of your Race, were I so vain, as to hope to add any thing to the honour of what's recorded in our Annals; I might dwell upon those Qualifications, that render you so amiable to all that know you, the Unaffected sincerity of your Nature, your Zeal for the welfare of your Country; your exem|plary Bravery, and just Sence of true Honour; but to do this, my Lord, wou'd be to entertain you with the daily Discourse of your Friends; as for Enemies, you have none but those you found in <HI>Flanders,</HI> where you were giving Commands to a Regiment, at an Age that others are receiving Precepts from a Tutor.</P>
<P>I dare say no more, tho' at the same time I disoblige one, I gratifie a thousand; for you are the only Person that can't bear to hear the Lord <HI>Lorn</HI> well spoke of: But since I would not purchase their approbation at the rate of your displeasure, I must relieve your Lordship from the pain of hearing what's your due, and only tell you that I am,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your Lordship's Most Devoted Humble Servant.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>I</HI> don't know whether I have more reason to be pleas'd or griev'd at the Fate of this Play; for the World is ve|ry jealous of applause, and he is sure to make a great many Enemies, that is so unfortunate to succeed.</P>
<P>Some have already done me the Honour to say, that it was not all Mine; tho' I am surpriz'd at the imputation, that what I once believed too great a Dowdy to belong to ev'n my self; should deserve to be thought another's! But the uneasy Criticks, upon a nearer view of its Features, have mortify'd me, and more judiciously concluded, that no Body wou'd own it but my self.</P>
<P>All that I shall say to these last is, that I did not design a just Play, and that I am as well pleas'd as they are, that I had no regard to the Vnities of Action, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but if I di|verted my Friends, without offending the Ladies, I have my wish.</P>
<P>These angry Gentlemen, I presume, will thank me for one thing, in the Third Act, and that is, I have put a Pun in the Mouth of the fine Lady; a Gentleman very remarkable for his good Nature and good Sence; told me of it before it was Acted, but he agreed with me, to allow the Folly, for the sake of the Diversion; it succeeded as we guest, and was always Clap'd.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">I confess I have had some grave Thoughts on the Occasion of such Labours, and methinks 'tis very strange, that the chief thing, that flatters the vanity of most Writers, is, what they can't know, for Fame is a good that never arrives to us till we are past injoying it, and we are only immortal when we are no more; as for my self, I presume, it will appear by what I have done, that I as little value, as deserve, that Honour, notwithstanding I don't doubt, but I shall be yet be|liev'd to have my share of the vanity; and that 'twill always be one reason of writing, to be thought a little wiser than we are

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<L>SInce Novelties your Palates still pursue,</L>
<L>You have to Night, both Play and Poet new:</L>
<L>From whence alone his hopes of pleasing grew.</L>
<L>For so much this prevailing Passion thrives,</L>
<L>Each for his future Appetite contrives,</L>
<L>New Friends, new Favourites, and of late&mdash;new Wives.</L>
<L>You Criticks only keep your Old disease,</L>
<L>When Authors please you least, you're most at ease.</L>
<L>Our Poet's therefore glad of a pretence,</L>
<L>To be insipid, in his own defence,</L>
<L>And if you hiss, 'tis still at your Expence.</L>
<L>Often for change the meanest things are good,</L>
<L>Thus tho' the Town all delicates afford,</L>
<L>A Kit-cat is a Supper for a Lord.</L>
<L>But if your Nicer tast resolves to Day,</L>
<L>To have no relish for our Author's Play.</L>
<L>Place some diverting Scene before your Mind,</L>
<L>And think of that, to which you will be kind.</L>
<L>So thus when heavily the moments pass,</L>
<L>Toaster's to Circulate the lazy Glass</L>
<L>By nameing some bright Nymph their draughts refine,</L>
<L>And tast at once the joys of Love and Wine.</L>

<P>YOU manage this Husband of yours very dextrously.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ast.</SPEAKER>
<P>While you live observe this; that the only way to rule a conceited Fool, is to seem to be rul'd by him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cla.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am convinc'd, but still admire by what strange Art you keep him at this distance, for I have hear'd that your Old Men, like those that have stinking Breaths, will always be drawing closer than other Folks!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, by a pretended distast of all Men, I have secur'd my self a|gainst one that I hate in earnest, so that now &mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cla.</SPEAKER>
<P>He avoids you to gain your Esteem!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ast.</SPEAKER>
<P>And 'tis his only way to gain it, for trust me <HI>Clarinda,</HI> there is no|thing so distastful as a Husband's fondness, and you had better be hated of the Man you Love, than Lov'd of the Man you hate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cla.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then we must hate if we Marry!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ast.</SPEAKER>
<P>You'll find it difficult to Love, for Marriage sets the Object too near us, and Love is a fine Flower, that loses its Scent if we keep it always at our Nose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cla.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where is the fault then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps 'tis in our selves&mdash;our Pleasures languish when they become familiar to us, and 'tis in Love as in Ambition, our thirst is still for some|thing that we have not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cla.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fansie the Dominion they pretend over us, may be one reason, and methinks the slavery's misplac'd, for the Government of Love shou'd be in the Women; They always make the Lover happy in his Chains; but&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Husbands, alas! Are like other Tyrants, the greatest good we ex|pect from 'em, is to do no harm.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cla.</SPEAKER>
<P>You indeed have reason to think so, for to a Woman of any Spleen, Sir <HI>Soloman</HI> must needs be of a very unlucky temper, and seems to have some|thing peculiar in him to Create aversion, for he is always talking, and al|ways giving his impertinent Advice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ast.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you can't oblige him more than to ask it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cla.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has all the ridiculous extremes of the Gay and the Grave, but I like nothing in him so much as his pretending to understand the World&mdash;he is so wise an Owl!</P>

<P>Nay since he has been, as he calls it, of the party, he has taken new Airs upon him; all my Family, forsooth, are order'd by rules of State, and he is grown so important to himself, that he's affraid the Cook or the Butler should Poyson him&mdash;but here he comes.</P>

<P>I have been perswading her, ever since you went, but she is so unwil|ling! &mdash; pray, Madam, gratify Sir <HI>Solomon,</HI> and go to the Play.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Sol.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ay do, My Dear, gratify me as my Cousin says, and go to the Play, you must not deny your self all the Pleasures of the World, for your Love of me, come it will divert you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Divert me! Is it possible, Sir <HI>Solomon,</HI> you shou'd have so little Re|ligion, as to fancy the Entertainment of that place cou'd give a Civil Wo|man any Pleasure? Not that I think, all are otherwise that go there, but the dishonest Liberties of the Stage are such, that we seldom hear any thing, that diverts without something that offends.</P>

<STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE>
<P>Poor Fool! But 'tis a wicked place!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cla.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the Moral, Madam, often leaves us a quite different impression.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay there you are lost <HI>Clarinda,</HI> for tell me a Play in which there is not for a Moral, if you Marry you're a Cuckold, and Woman's Virtue is a <HI>Chimara.</HI></P>

<STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE>
<P>Well I am certainly the only Husband in this Town, that is not one&mdash;How happy am I in a Wife&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cla.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Licence is indeed too great, yet the fault is equal in the Town, and the Poet who only shows us the World a little too near, for, turn but your Eyes off the Stage, and you shall see that your agreeable Woman is a Coquet, and your agreeable Man an Athiest, and the first step to be very witty, is (it seems) to be very wicked.</P>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>I don't understand those things, but am sorry you Converse with such People, for the next Scandal to the being a Poet, is to keep 'em Com|pany.</P>

<P>I'll Answer for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I did not apprehend it, but the World, that seldom makes a true Judgment, content themselves with the appearances of things, and your Cha|racter is drawn from the Airs that you make in make in Publick.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Sol.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Looky' Wife, I wou'd be mistaken in some things, a good States Man, like a good Wrestler, conceals his strength for an opportunity, and my Capacity is a Secret&mdash;but you are Women and don't understand things.</P>

<P>The best way to avoid that danger, wou'd be to marry her; for most Wives may be Antimonial Cups long enough, without being found out of their Husbands; but to prevent that, <HI>Tom,</HI> I design to break all the Glasses, and kick the Doctor down Stairs, on the Wedding day; and so I have told her.</P>

<P>Your Ladiship makes me proud.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lad.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have made at least twenty Visits to day, and not above Ten were at home, which I take to be a great good Fortune, in having my Day's Journey so happily shortned to your Ladiship, for in you I terminate my Evening: And 'tis so bless'd a thing to arrive where one loves, after the tedious Endearments of so many one hates in a Day's visiting.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lad.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Madam, at my Lady <HI>Thrivewell</HI>'s in the City, who knows no other Happiness, and thinks there is no other Welcome but Eating and Drinking! At the Sight of her Table I was ready to swoon, coming out of the Air! Huh!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ast.</SPEAKER>
<P>How was it spread, Madam?</P>
</SP>

<P>Ha, ha! a goodly Appearance!</P>

<P>The Table, (or rather Larder) was fill'd with <HI>Westphalia</HI> Hams, Pullets, and Turkey-Pies; with a great <HI>Cheshire</HI> Cheese, that rival'd every one in bulk but her Ladiship; and a large Tankard of Ale, enough to de|stroy a Dozen Porters. Huh! Huh! &mdash;</P>

<P>She forc'd me to sit down, and put enough upon my Plate to serve me my whole Life &mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ast.</SPEAKER>
<P>She design'd you a Complement &mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Ladiship knows the Elegance of Life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lad.</SPEAKER>
<P>I aim at it a little &mdash; But there is one Mark by which you may know such Creatures, tho' you don't see 'em; for it is the most Essential Property of the Vulgar to speak loud; their common Discourse is some Degrees above the Noise of a Drum. For which Reason, when any raises their Voice above a Whisper, I strait conclude, That they are either no Quality, or at most but half Blood; and 'tis likely the Fault might be of the Side of the Mother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha! Your Ladiship is certainly the most entertaining Creature!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lad.</SPEAKER>
<P>But now Ladies, exactly opposite to this, is the Life of the Refin'd and Well-bred part of the Creation. The Vulgar, like other Beasts, are up and Feeding before it is Day; but about a Delicate Creature every thing is slow and solemn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cla.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Noises of the Streets, Madam, must be great Enemies to that Quiet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lad.</SPEAKER>
<P>So great, that I have often wonder'd why the Government don't provide against so manifest a Barbarism. They should defend our Ears against offensive Sounds, and banish all that had the little Breeding to rise before Eleven a Clock.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ast.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shou'd vote for that Law; for I'm a mighty Friend to my Pillow&mdash;But pray, Madam, go on with your Description.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lad.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here then, Ladies, I must needs lament that we are in some respects not unlike the Crowd; And that it is still a Custom among us to go upon our own Legs. I have often admir'd the <HI>Chinese</HI> Nobility; who, to prevent the Infamy of so Vulgar an Exercise, contract the Feet of their Infant-Quality, and keep 'em so little, that when they are of Age they may not use 'em; and never cut their Nails that they might not be suspected to work with a Needle &mdash; Is it not a Scandal to the Nobles of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> to let a <HI>Barbarian</HI> transcend 'em in so high a point of Elegance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cla.</SPEAKER>
<P>That, indeed, is one step to take away the Trouble of moving at all, and make 'em live the Life of a Plant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lad.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which wou'd be truly, bless'd! For methinks People of Quality shou'd be known more by their Passions than their Figure; and that is al|ways a certain Way: For our Joy never rises above a Smile, nor our Sor|row above the Decency and Colour of our Clothes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cla.</SPEAKER>
<P>So that when a dear Friend dies &mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lad.</SPEAKER>
<P>To shed Tears is the Grief of a Peasant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cla.</SPEAKER>
<P>It discovers our Love at least.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lad.</SPEAKER>
<P>As ill as it does our Breeding; For our Love for the Dead is best shown in our Respect to the Living, and there the Fashion is against it; be|sides Tears are the worst Wash one can possibly use for the Complexion &mdash;
<PB N="27" REF="18">
Huh, Huh!--But to make an end of this Subject; There is one thing that more remarkably distinguishes Persons of Rank from the Commons, and that is our Natural Contempt of Business. Now the Vulgar, like a Hackney-Horse, never stir abroad without something to do; and they visit, like a Merchant upon <HI>Change,</HI> for their Profit more than their Pleasure. But it is a Reproach to the Honour of a Well-bred <HI>Woman,</HI> to have any thing in her Head but the Fashions, or to know any Fatigue but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Idleness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cla.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does your Ladiship never go to the Play?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lad.</SPEAKER>
<P>Often, Madam, but not to mind the Actors, for it is common to love Sights &mdash; My great Diversion is to turn my Eyes upon the Middle Gallery;&mdash;or when a Citizen crowds her self in among us, 'tis an unspeak|able Pleasure to contemplate her Airs and her Dres&mdash;And they never escape me; for I am as apprehensive of such Creatures coming near me, as some People are when a Cat is in the Room&mdash;Huh! huh!

<P>Farewel Hermaphrodite, &mdash; well this is a night of Intrigues, no|thing but Stratagems; <HI>Tom,</HI> I begin to be in Love with my self, when I think I was the first Ingineer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fre.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay 'twas all your own Contrivance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Sol.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>All things break out so, luckily: But stay there's <HI>Careless</HI> left how shall we provide for him, he's a very honest Fellow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't Name that Sir <HI>Solomon,</HI> if you intend to prefer me &mdash; but now I have no hopes of being a General, I think I must go into the Country, and be my Elder Brother's Butler.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Sol.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, thou hadst always a kindness for the Cellar, but if you wou'd make your Fortune under him, get to be his Steward, <HI>Iack,</HI> rather than his Butler, for then you may come to be richer than your Master in a little time if you have any Discretion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which I never had &mdash; but there's another way I like better, if you wou'd promise me your Interest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Sol.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>If it be not to serve the Court-Party, I promise you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in the least 'tis only to perswade that Lady (who I have found is your Relation) to think better of me than I do of my self, and take me for Life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Sol.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That's a long Lease, but she has 200<HI>l.</HI> a Year to keep it in re|pair &mdash; <STAGE>(<HI>Turning to</HI> Sylvia)</STAGE> well Cousen, what think you of this Hand|some Scoundrel? H'as been a Volunteer a great while, let him now fight under a Commission.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>You see Madam, how Ominous it was to begin with a Quarrel, I knew 'twou'd be a Match, by our Scolding before hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Syl.</SPEAKER>
<P>If we don't after, 'twill be well enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well <HI>Clarinda,</HI> I wish you perfect Joy and must own to you, that your life is the Happiest &mdash; there all is Quiet, all is Peace, there is nothing to steal the Colour from your Cheeks, or betray you to Surprizes, and now I am convinc'd of the Folly, the Confusion and the Adversity of Mine.</P>
<L>The Guilty still with anxious Cares are prest,</L>
<L>The truly Good alone are truly Blest.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE, By a FRIEND.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Spoken by the Sickly LADY.</STAGE>
<L>LET none hereafter Plays Vngodly call,</L>
<L>For this was writ to mortifie you all.</L>
<L>No Parson's here expos'd, no Brothel storm'd,</L>
<L>But a kind handsome keeping <HI>Wife Reform'd.</HI></L>
<L>A sign the Youth the World n'er understood,</L>
<L>Or else he would not dare to be so good.</L>
<L>He must the Fame he aims at quite disown,</L>
<L>Who draws good Characters to spoil his own.</L>
<L>This to excuse I thought a Friend he'd need,</L>
<L>And came &mdash; sick as I am, his Cause to plead:</L>
<L>'Tis the first Visit I protest I've made.</L>
<L>You're sometimes kind to what I do before you;</L>
<L>Pity the Youth, for my sake I implore you,</L>
<L>Hissing to Death my tender Organ Wounds!</L>
<L>And a sick Ear abhors ungrateful Sounds:</L>
<L>Yet can Applause though ne'er so loud give Ease,</L>
<L>For they who flatter Women always please.</L>
<L>Then vain Assistance will I now explore</L>
<L>In Physick and Astrology no more.</L>
<L>You, dear Physicians, must my Health insure,</L>
<L>And t'other Visit will confirm my Cure;</L>
<L>Else what's already done &mdash; is all in vain,</L>
<L>And I relapse &mdash; till you come here again.</L>
<L>By you I shall be always to be seen,</L>
<L>For whate'er ails the <HI>sickly Fair</HI> within,</L>
<L>The Doctor at all Seasons is let in.</L>
