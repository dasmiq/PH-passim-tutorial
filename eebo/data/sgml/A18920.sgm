<HEAD>TO EVERY SOVLE that seeketh after Trueth in humilitie: for God resi|steth the Proud, and giueth Grace to the Humble.</HEAD>
<P>_OVR Sauiour fore-see|ing, that many (vnder the cloake of,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 24<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">23 &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>Going out of Babel</HI>) would go out of the Church, saying, Here is Christ, there is Christ; he chargeth his Folowers, <HI>not to be|leeue them</HI>: much lesse to goe out. This wickednesse is growen now so ex|cellent, as if the true <HI>Christ</HI> could not be found otherwhere, then without in Woods, Mikes, by-Stables, Barnes, and Hay-loftes; wherevpon, all the speach now, is, Goe out, goe out of <HI>Ba|bel,</HI> come into the secret places.</P>
<P><PB REF="3"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 7.15.16. &amp;c</NOTE> Our Sauiour foreseeing, that Wol|uish-teachers should come to the people in Sheepes-skinnes (that is, in Sheepe|like conuersation,) and by such shee|pish outward moralitie, labour to couer their Woluish, pricking, Schismaticall Doctrine, (for Doctrine is the fruite there spoken of, their outward cariage being otherwise Sheepish,) he sayth to his true Folowers, <HI>Yee shall know them by their fruites</HI>: that is, you onely, that be indued with the true spi|rit of meekenes &amp; lowlines, shall know them by the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>This phrase is vsed in Pro|uerbs 10.21.31. &amp; 18.20.21. &amp;c.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Fruite of their lippes,</HI> their schismaticall Doctrine. They shall haue the name of <HI>Prophets</HI> (a ve|rie good name) and their outward ca|riage shalbe like to Christes sheepe (a very commendable thing, and able to draw many) but examine once the fruite of their lippes, issuing from them as Prophets, <HI>Tunc Lupus est in fa|bula,</HI> t
hen he is a deuowring Wolfe; howsoeuer he say (as some did in <HI>Esaias</HI>

Tim. 3.6.</NOTE> <HI>which creepe into houses, and lead captiue simple wo|men laden with sinnes, &amp; led with diuers lustes; which women are euer learning, and are neuer able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</HI></P>
<P>The Spirit of Prophecie, hauing so plainely fore-prophesied of our times, and false-spirites, what are we, that we should be negligent in trying the spi|rits, whether they be of God? And see|ing that these spirituall Wolues, shall for their outwarde cariage and life, seeme to be Christes Sheepe and poore innocent Lambes (and <HI>for that,</HI> many times be more worthy reuerence, then some of the truest Teachers) it stan|deth people therefore vpon, not to be caryed with a few painted flimflams, but by the speare of Discretion, to gage the side of the <HI>Grecians</HI> wooden
<PB REF="4">
Horse, for trying out, whether the in|wardes be not planted with engines of death. <HI>Latet anguis in herba</HI>; the fairest face hath not alwayes the truest heart. <HI>Satan</HI> in policie, would haue his <HI>Seminaries,</HI> in th'outwarde appea|rance, to excell <HI>Christes</HI> Ministers; that so, as them selues be deceiued, they may likewise deceiue others. As for the true Ministers of <HI>Christ, Satan</HI> must needs labour to spot them outwardly, seeing he cannot keepe backe the doct|rinall sappe of Gods spirit; which di|stilling from the lippes of the Teacher, is to beget and feed many.</P>
<P>Herevpon it is, that true Doctrine is often reiected, because of some ex|ternall want in the Teacher. And a|gaine, because of some excellent com|mendable outward things (in a <HI>Duck|frier,</HI> or a smooth <HI>Pharise,</HI>) any doct|rine is easily swallowed, be it schisma|ricall, hereticall, or trayterous: A plaine signe, that such people are yet
<PB REF="4">
destitute of that spirit, whereby they should be able to try Doctrine, and dis|cerne Spirits. And not onely that, but also full of giddy passions, and head|strong affections; as wil appeare in the ensuing Dialogues: where the very naturall character of such spirits, is by mee set downe; not without sundrie yeares experience had of them all: as also with no small expences.</P>
<P>If thine heart be vn-hardned, it will easily ioyne with mee: If other|wise, yet herein I shall be comforted, that in this worke I haue serued God and his Church truly, though weakely. If something in the Conferrours seeme too light, consider first, it is but the naturall character of that spi|rit: and secondly, that it is but as a feeling of that spirites pulse, without any commoration or dwelling vp|pon it.</P>
<P>As I could, I haue done. If it please, it is that I pray for: if it displease any,
<PB REF="5">
I shall (through Gods grace) not one|ly peaceably passe by it; but also, with patience awayte the change of their iudgement and affection. Farewell.</P>

<P><HI>In your. &amp;c. you may vnderstande many other Bookes, the most of your publique Sermons; and specially your Conuenticles in secret, where your pri|uat Disciples might priuately applaud you. And if you remember, I was one of your Classis, when in <HI>Cambridge</HI> you (in secret) chattred out that Ser|mon vpon Rom.</HI> 12. <HI>which afterwardes was published without name; because (it seemeth) you were not minded, for

<P>A member I am, but no <HI>Ordinarie</HI> member. For though I sometimes heare some man preach that is but <HI>oc|casionally,</HI> as a man passing by some Scolds, might occasionally giue them a while the hearing. And as for the sacrament of Communion, I neuer meddle with it; because <HI>Righteousnes</HI> can haue no fellowship with <HI>vnrighte|ousnes:</HI>

and so I am no ordinarie mem|ber.</P>

<SPEAKER>Flyer.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>O monstrous hypocrisie, with your two-peny-ordinary. Was it euer heard of in the Bible, that a man should be a member &amp; not a member of a Church; which you call a member not-ordinary. So I may be a member of the Church of</HI> Rome, <HI>a member of</HI> Mahomets <HI>Si|nagogue, and of whom not. It this be not a</HI> Babel, <HI>a Confusion of men and manners, what then can bee?

<P>The most (it may be) doe: but (it may be) that some there know that my heart is against their doinges.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flyer.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>So, the good testimonie which you should seeke for of men, doth rest vpon,</HI> It may be, it may be. <HI>It may be you may leaue this halting; but I know
<PB N="6" REF="8">
not when. The Prophet</HI> Daniel <HI>had not this subtiltie, when (though he did well) he would not be thought of any, to do euill, as omitting duetie of prayer to God.</HI> Hananiah, Azariah, <HI>and</HI> Mi|shael, <HI>could (by your Religion) haue bowed before the Idoll, and notwith|standing haue sayd, that their heartes were against it: and one of them could haue borne witnesse of anothers good meaning. But they had learned, that both body and soule were bought with a price (euen with the blood of the im|maculate Lambe) and therefore they must glorifie God in both. Trueth is naked, and seekes none of these corners. But tell me, I pray you: If the King should giue all his Subiects leaue, to forsake all communion with the Con|fused people, leitourgie and gouerne|ment of the Church of England, would you not for sake them all, and betake you presently to that Church whereof I am a member?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mal-cont</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, I should. And that is the maine point in truth, the King not gi|uing leaue to come out of this <HI>Aegypt,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="8">
this spirituall house of bondage.</P>

<P>Mal-content, <HI>You tearme your Church uery fitly,</HI> A spirituall house of bondage. <HI>And because</HI> Spirituall, <HI>therefore not to be fraied in till y^e King giue leaue to goe out. Do more then the Theefe, Adulterer, or Durtherer, is to stay in his sinne, till the King bid him go out. And yet these euils against the second Table onely; whereas the other is hypocrisie in Religion, and flat Idolatrie against the first Table of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orall law, which commaundeth</HI> Ho|lynesse <HI>towardes God, as the second inioyneth</HI> Righteousnesse <HI>towardes man.

<SP>

<P>True, but no flight to continue with any people, whose language they vnderstood not: much lesse, there to plant a Church.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mal-con.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, we haue (some of vs) moe ex|ceptions
<PB N="9" REF="11">
against you. For you can|not be contented onely to depart from vs, but you condemne euery soule of our Church, for a lim of the sonne of Perdition, and so to stand visibly in the state of damnation: Whereas you know well enough, that many of vs grone vnder the bur|den of sinne, and do striue after that is good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flyer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mal-content, Mal-content, <HI>you must not onely grone vnder sinne, but grieue at it, and fly from it, as I, and others haue: who as Hee-goates be|fore the Flocke, haue gone foorth, with our faces towardes</HI> Sion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mal-con.</SPEAKER>
<P>Besides (M. <HI>Flyer,</HI>) in the writings you publish, you fill all the Mar|gines with allegations from Scrip|ture, and the most to none, or to a ly|ing purpose. As to giue one in|stance. It is held of you and vs, that the new Testament hath his peculiar forme of Church-gouernment, giuen by <HI>Christ</HI>; and that the old Testament hath his peculiar gouernment, giuen by <HI>Moses.</HI> And yet for proofe of
<PB N="10" REF="12">
<HI>Christes</HI> Discipline and Institutions, you quote Scriptures from the olde Testament, which planely establish the <HI>Mosaicall</HI> orders. A seconde in|stance may be this: Such Scriptures as speake of the inuisible Church (kno|wen to God, for holy and vnspotted) you quote for probatio~ of the visible Church her state and constitution, which you intende must be <HI>Visibly</HI> all holy and vnspotted in this life.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mal-con.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay sir, which is more. M. <HI>Henrie Barrow</HI> drawing a <HI>Description of the true Church</HI>&punc; when he comes to deliuer the <HI>Canons of discipline</HI>&punc; he in that sheete of Paper, doth after the <HI>Excommunica|tion,</HI> place that Canon of the Apostle, in 2. <HI>Thess.</HI> 3.15. <HI>Yet count him not as an
<PB N="11" REF="12">
enimie, but admonish him as a brother,</HI> be|cause he beleeued, that excommuni|cation was a power to edification, not to destruction. Your Congrega|tion then, some yeares after his death, do reprint it, putting to it the olde date, corrupting his method, falsify|ing his Will, by placing the sayd Ca|non before Excommunication; be|cause after the <HI>casting out,</HI> you would rid your handes of all tendernes and compassion, as delighting in nothing more, then in bitternesse against the soule distressed. The Apostle can say,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gala.</HI> 3.1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> <HI>Though it be but a mans Couenant</HI> (or Will) <HI>when it is confirmed, no man doth abrogate it, or addeth any thing thereto.</HI> But you haue done that which <HI>No man</HI> (that is, no honest man) would doe, in so causing his <HI>Will</HI> to speake contrary to his meaning.</P>

trueth is, Hee is to be held a meere Man, as was <HI>Peter, Paul,</HI> or I: Onely, whereas we haue the Spirit in mea|sure, and were borne in sinne; hee had the Spirit beyond measure, and was borne free from sinne.

<HI>GOD,</HI> it intendeth not his Essence, but his office; and you know, that in such respect, the Magistrate is called God.

I being con|uented before him, he beginnes to puffe, he strokes vp his forehead, and then sotted out this question. Syrrha, doe you hold, that <HI>Iesus Christ</HI> is but meere man as I, or an other man is? To whom I answered: They ab|use mee, and haue abused your eares, that haue reported any such thing of mee. Then (quoth he againe) doe you deny <HI>Christ</HI> to be God? To whom I answered, No sir; I do verily beleeue that he is God&punc; Doe you so? That doe I, (quoth I.)

Yea, in so strict com|munion with the Children of the Kingdome, as such euil-ones cannot be excommunicate with the good of the Church; and therefore permitted to grow, till GOD weed them out. The Tare is not euery euill, for then euery euill should grow, and the Churches censures were idle: but they be such euil-ones, as can be no more remooued with the Churches good, then Tares from Wheate, with which it first groweth vp hypocriti|cally as Wheate: but in time, disclo|seth it selfe for a close winder about, not an vpright grower.</P>
<P>Wantes are to be lamented, and the good not fled from: much lesse condemned for no Wheate, because it standes in some communion with Tares. Other Weedes that grow loose from the Wheate, are timelily to be remooued; and yet if the Husband|man

sometimes neglect that dutie, God forbid, that we should therevp|pon conclude, that all the Wheate is no more Wheate; and so no visible Christian in the Lordes possession.</P>
<P>Nor do the Holy thinges of God, cease to be Holy, because they be sometimes conueyde to euil-ones, so well as to them be good, (euen as the Raine is the same, which God sendeth vpon the Wheate and Tare, Hearbe and Weede:) but the Holy thinges prophaned, become <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">1.

<P>O brother, the Sacrifices were seasoned with Salt, before they fla|med on the Alter: and so should our Soules be seasoned with Discretion, before they flamed in our Churches.
