<P>IT is said by the Philosopher, that he merits more
Honour, who can maintain a City in Peace,

that <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> (though a Mighty Vaunter) con|fest,
that <HI>Cyneas</HI> had won more Citties by his
Wisdome, then he had Conquered with his Sword.
<HI>Corona Civica,</HI> and <HI>Corona Ovalis,</HI> the one of
Oake, the other of Mirtle, were ever held more law|dable

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<L><HI>TIME</HI> is the Register of all Mens Acts</L>
<L>Or good, or bad, their vertue and their facts.</L>
<L>Although by violence he hath bin made</L>
<L>a Property unto the Traytors Trade;</L>
<L>Yet Time (that every secret brings to light)</L>
<L>At last (you see) their Treacheries requites,</L>
<L>Payes them in their own Coyn, the bloody stamp,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> hath turn'd Surgeon, cur'd them of the Cramp.</L>
<L>" Treason may flourish for a little space,</L>
<L>" but Time at length writes Villane in its face.</L>
<L>Whil'st <HI>Iulius Caesars</HI> death Revengless past</L>
<L><HI>Rome</HI> nere was free from sword Fire Plague and Wast</L>
<L>Till Time reveal'd the Murderers and then</L>
<L>their better Genius did return agen,</L>
<L>And clos'd up <HI>Ianus</HI> Temple. Though Time hath</L>
<L>bin curst by those had neither wit nor faith,</L>
<L>But rashly did conclude hee'd never mend</L>
<L>And therefore in despair did wish his End.</L>
<L>Yet he for every sore and malady</L>
<L>hath brought you home a <HI>Soveraign</HI> remedy,</L>
<L>Occasion is his foretop, which had some</L>
<L>long since ta'ne hold of, bad daies had not come,</L>
<L>Twas not Times fault, but theirs that let him go,</L>
<L>Hee's swift of foot, their Courage was but slow,</L>
<L>You have been wise in this (Sir) to your praise,</L>
<L>Oretak'n Time, renew'd the Alchion daies,</L>

With such Alacrity, that poreing on</L>
<L>with serious eye, my Enchyridion</L>
<L>That monstrous Murder that outfac'd the Sun</L>
<L>Appears to me as yesterday but done,</L>
<L>So home hath Justice follow'd them, their heels</L>
<L>are now tript up, each his own horror feels.</L>
<L>This was Times worke, though wisdome was the scout</L>
<L>without Time nothing could be brought a bout</L>
<L>Peace is restor'd; Truth doth in Triumph ride,</L>
<L>(not long since scorn'd, forsaken, and deny'd.)</L>
<L>Plenty their hand-maid follows to maintain</L>
<L>the Majesty of the Heroick Train</L>
<L>It is a Maxime (Traytors bitter Cupp)</L>
<L>" warrs maketh Theives, but Peace doth hang them up:</L>
<L>Since Time has done such Cures by Providence,</L>
<L>let him not be abus'd under pretence</L>
<L>Of this, or that, seeds of Phanatick braines;</L>
<L>But while you Govern (Sir) hold in the Reynes;</L>
<L>And while the glorious starr-bestudy'd skye</L>
<L>retains a light your Fame shall never dy.</L>
