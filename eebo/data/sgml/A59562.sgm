<HEAD>A SERMON Preached before the Honourable House of Commons.</HEAD>
<Q><BIBL>Deut. V. xxix.</BIBL>
<P>O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my Commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their Children for ever.</P></Q>
<P>THese are the words of God to <HI>Moses</HI> concerning the Children of <HI>Israel.</HI> And two things may be gathered from them.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. His serious desire of their Happiness</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. The means whereby that Happiness is to be attained.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The first of these is imported in that so|lemn
<PB REF="3">
<HI>wish</HI> into which the Text is framed: <HI>O that there were such an heart in them,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>that it might be well with them, and with their Children for ever.</HI></P>
<P>The second is imported in the way of connecting the former part of the wish with that which follows: <HI>O that there were such an heart in them,</HI> what then? <HI>that they would fear me, and keep all my Commandments always,</HI> and why so? It follows, <HI>That it might be well with them, and with their Children for ever.</HI> Which plainly implies, That the way to have things well with them, and with their Children, is to fear God, and keep all his Commandments always.</P>
<P>I have but one thing more to observe con|cerning the Text, and that is this: That the wish or desire that God here expresses of <HI>Israel</HI>'s <HI>Vertue</HI> and <HI>Happiness,</HI> doth not so much relate to the <HI>Israelites,</HI> considered <HI>singly,</HI> and as <HI>parti|cular</HI> Persons, (though it cannot be denied, but it doth extend to them, even under that notion) but it chiefly relates to the Chil|dren of <HI>Israel</HI> considered <HI>collectively,</HI> that is to say, under the notion of a <HI>People</HI> or <HI>Nation.</HI> God here expresses his care of the whole Nation, and seriously wishes they may be a happy
<PB N="3" REF="3">
People, they and their Children after them.</P>
<P>Two points then we have from this Text very proper to be insisted on upon this occa|sion, which therefore I shall make the Heads of my following Discourse.</P>
<P>First, <HI>That God is seriously concerned for the good and happiness of Nations and Kingdoms, as well as that of particular Persons; and more especi|ally of those Nations that profess his true Religion.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>That the Happiness and Prosperity of Nations is to be attained the same way that any par|ticular Man's happiness is,</HI> that is to say, <HI>by fear|ing God and keeping his Commandments.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. I begin with the first, That <HI>God is seri|ously concerned for the good and happiness of Nations and Kingdoms, as well as that of particular Persons; and more especially of those Nations that profess his true Religion.</HI></P>
<P>I do not think this is much doubted of by any Christian, and therefore I need not insist on a laborious proof of it.</P>
<P>That God who doth not overlook the mean|est and the most inconsiderable Creatures that he hath made; but so far concerns himself in taking care of them, and providing for them, that not so much as <HI>a Sparrow</HI> (if we may be|lieve our Saviour) <HI>doth fall to the ground without
<PB N="4" REF="4">
his will</HI>: Can it be imagined, that he is not more concerned for the happiness and well being of the noblest part of the visible Crea|tion, <HI>Mankind</HI> who bear his own Image, and whom he looks upon as his own Children? Certainly he is.</P>
<P>And that God whose Care and Providence doth so particularly extend to every individual Man, that (as the same our Lord Jesus speaks) <HI>the very hairs of our head are numbered by him.</HI> Can it be imagined, that he doth not still take more care of the greater Bodies and Combina|tions of Men, such as Nations and Kingdoms, which are so many ways more considerable than single Men, and in whose Fortunes the good or ill of particular Persons is so wholly bound up? Certainly he doth.</P>
<P>And lastly, That God who is the Author, the Preserver, the Protector of all publick So|cieties, <HI>by whom Kings Reign, and Magistrates de|cree Iustice</HI>: Can it be imagined that he hath not still a more particular regard to those Na|tions that he hath been pleased to call by his own Name, and hath chosen for his own Peo|ple (such as were the <HI>Israelites</HI> in my Text, of old; and such are all those Peoples and Nati|ons now that do profess his true Religion)? Certainly he hath.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4">Thus natural reason will teach us to argue. And that it is a right way of arguing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 6.26.30. 1 Cor. 9.9.</NOTE> is con|firmed to us by our Saviour and St. <HI>Paul,</HI> both of which we find reasoning after this manner.</P>
<P>To quote to you all that the Scripture saith upon this Argument, would be endless. One of the great designs of God's word, is to pos|sess us with a hearty Belief, that God, as he is the Creator, so is he also the Governour of the World. And that his Providence extends to all the Things and Persons in it. And that the constant rule and measure of that Providence, is no other than the good of the World, and the good of every person in it, so far as his private good is consistent with the publick. And that therefore as God designs all good to every particular Man, so doth he more espe|cially design the good of Nations and King|doms in all his dispensations of Providence to them. Nor is there any thing happens in any Na|tion or Kingdom but with his approbation. Even the severest visitations that come upon Mankind are from him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Amos 3.6. Is. 28.21. Mic. 7.18. Lam. 3.33.</NOTE> <HI>There is no evil happens to a City, but the Lord hath done it.</HI> Though yet <HI>Iudgment is his strange work.</HI> And <HI>Mercy and loving kind|ness is the thing wherein he delights. He doth not af|flict willingly, nor grieve the Children of Men.</HI> But
<PB N="6" REF="5">
sometimes it is necessary that Nations should be scourged; yet even, that is, for the grea|ter good of Mankind.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is. 26.9.</NOTE> <HI>That</HI> thus <HI>when God's Iudgments are in the earth, the Inhabitants of the World may learn righteousness.</HI></P>
<P>But then as for his own People, those upon whom his name is called, those that are in Covenant with him, and profess his true Reli|gion; for them upon all occasions he declares so great a tenderness and concernment; that there is hardly any figure of speech that the most sensible Man can make use of, for the ex|pressing his most passionate love to his dearest Friend or Relation, though it be his Wife or his Children, but the very same figures are made use of by the holy inspired Writers to set out to us the kindness and concernment that God hath for his own People. He is their <HI>God,</HI> their <HI>King,</HI> their <HI>Shepherd,</HI> their <HI>Father,</HI> their <HI>Husband.</HI> They are his <HI>chosen ones.</HI> His <HI>de|light,</HI> his <HI>peculiar Treasure. He rejoiceth over them to do them good. His bowels earn, his heart is turned within him, his repentings are kindled together,</HI> when through their miscarriages he is forced to pass any severe Sentence upon them. All this is the language of God in Scripture, when he speaks of his People, and therefore we cannot doubt
<PB N="7" REF="5">
of his sincere affection to them, and particular care of them.</P>
<P>All the doubt is, whether these expressions ought to be applied to any other people than the Jews, with respect to whom the Scripture useth them. But we that believe the Gospel need not make much doubt of it. For it is cer|tain, the reason of all these expressions of kindness to the Jews more than to other Na|tions, was founded in this; that they were the People whom God had chosen to plant his Church among. They were the People where his Religion was owned. But now it is evi|dent to all Christians, that after our Saviour came into the World, and Preached his Gospel to all Nations, the Jews, as a <HI>Nation,</HI> ceased to be God's Church, or peculiar People; and from that time all those Nations that embraced Christ's Religion, came into their place, and were from thence forward to be as dear to God, and as much his <HI>Care</HI> and his <HI>Treasure,</HI> as ever the Jews were. And upon that account, we of this Nation, may with as much reason, apply the expressions of Scripture to our selves, which declare God's kindness and concern|ment for his People, as ever the Jews did.</P>
<P>Especially, considering that God has owned
<PB N="8" REF="6">
us of this Nation for his People, in as remark|able a manner as any Nation in Christendom. As appears not only from that glorious light of the Gospel, which he has for many years blessed us with, above any other people per|haps in the Christian World: But also from the wonderful Providences, by which he has from time to time preserved our Church, and with it the true Religion among us, notwith|standing the various attempts of our Enemies to subvert it. O may these Mercies of God to our Nation never be forgotten, and may we always remember them with that due thank|fullness they call for at our hands.</P>
<P>And thus much of our first head. I beg leave to draw a practical Inference or two from what hath been said, before I proceed to the other.</P>
<P>First, Since it appears, that God sits at the Helm, and steers and manages all the af|fairs of Mankind; and that publick Societies are more especially the objects of his Care and Providence: Methinks this consideration should be a good Antidote against all those troublesome Fears and Sollicitude, we are apt to disturb our selves with, about the success of publick matters.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="6">
If indeed all things went in the World by Chance or Fate, and there was no God that did superintend human affairs; I should think it very natural for Men to be extreamly con|cerned at every piece of ill news they heard. It might be allowed them to break their sleep in the night, and to complain dismally in the day of the sad times that were coming upon us. But since we are certain, as much as we are certain that there is a God, and as much as we are certain that the Scripture is true; that all our affairs, our publick as well as our pri|vate affairs; the affairs both in Church and State, are entirely in God Almighty's disposal, and that <HI>He</HI> doth really manage and order all things among us; and likewise so manageth them, that all shall at last turn to the good of his People, and to the good of every honest Man: I say, since we are, or may be satisfied, that our Business is in so good hands, I must confess I do not see what reason people have, to give themselves so much trouble and unea|siness, about things that may, or may not come.</P>
<P>Thus far indeed, it is fit that every one should be concerned; nay it is fit that every one should charge his Conscience with it:
<PB N="10" REF="7">
Namely to do his duty to the publick in his place and station; to contribute all that is in his power towards the procuring and promo|ting the common Happiness; and to endea|vour all that in him lies, towards the averting those Judgments we have reason to fear. But when a Man hath done this, to what purpose is it for him to trouble himself any further? I should think he had better follow our Saviour's advice, which when all things are considered, will be found Eternally Prudent and Reason|able:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 6.34.</NOTE> <HI>Take no thought for to morrow: let the mor|row take care for the things of it self: sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, This Doctrine ought to teach us this farther Lesson; to depend altoge|ther upon God Almighty, and upon him only, for the good success of our Affairs, either in Church or State, whenever they are in a doubtful or dangerous condition.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 19.21.</NOTE> For <HI>though many are the devices in the hearts of men; neverthe|less the counsel of the Lord that shall stand.</HI> It is in vain to trust to human means: For be our strength never so great; or be those that man|age for us never so industrious; or be our hearts never so much united: Yet it is an easy matter for God to blast all our designs, and to
<PB N="11" REF="7">
disappoint all our Counsels in a moment.</P>
<P>He hath often done so, where Men have been confident in their own strength.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Kings 19.34.</NOTE> In one nights time he made that prodigious Army of the <HI>Assyrians,</HI> that came up against <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and thought themselves sure of taking it; to decamp and fly back into their own Country, leaving a hundred and fourscore thousand of their number, dead upon the place.</P>
<P>There is in truth no trusting to an <HI>arm of Flesh.</HI> For the successes of War depend upon a thousand Contingencies, which it is not in the power of mortal Men, either to foresee, or remedy.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccles. 9.11. Ps. 33.16.</NOTE> So that <HI>the race is not always to the swift, nor the Battel to the strong; nor can a King be sav'd by the multitude of an Host, nor any mighty Man be delivered by his much strength.</HI> But the <HI>God of Hea|ven that ruleth in the Kingdoms of Men</HI>; it is He that preserves or destroys; that gives Victory, or sends a Defeat, as it pleaseth him. And therefore he is, by way of eminence, stiled, <HI>The Lord of Hosts,</HI> the God of Battels.</P>
<P>On the other hand, If our affairs at any time be in so very bad a posture, that we can|not avoid the having a melancholy dismal pro|spect of things; yet let us not be discouraged, let us still trust in God; let us do what belongs
<PB N="12" REF="8">
to us to do for the obtaining his Mercy and Favour, and then refer the Event to him. God hath certainly a kindness for his People, and if we do our parts towards the preserving his Af|fection to us, we may still hope he will conti|nue to be our Saviour and Deliverer.</P>
<P>It is as easy to God <HI>to save by few as by many.</HI> The Walls of <HI>Iericho,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Josh. 6.20.</NOTE> at his Command, fell down flat, only at the sound of Rams-Horns. And when the City of <HI>Samaria</HI> was Besieged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Kings 7. ch.</NOTE> and brought into the greatest extremity that was possible, so that Women even ate their own Children: yet in one night, God by an unaccountable terrour, which he struck into the hearts of the Enemies, raised the Siege. And such plenty was left in their Camp, that every one of the Besieged had wherewith, not only to satisfy his hunger, but to enrich him|self. Only that Nobleman that would not be|lieve this when it was foretold by the Prophet, did not live to tast of the Fruits of God Al|mighty's Victory, being trodden to death in the Crowd.</P>
<P N="2">II. But it is time to come to the second general point I observed from this Text; <HI>viz. That the Happiness and Prosperity of Nations, is to be attained the same way that any particular Man's
<PB N="13" REF="8">
happiness is</HI>; that is to say, <HI>by being sincerely vir|tuous and religious</HI>; or, as my Text expresses it, <HI>by fearing God, and keeping all his Commandments always.</HI></P>
<P>This is a true Proposition, both with respect to particular Persons and to Nations too; but with this difference, That if we take Happi|ness and Prosperity for that which the World accounts so, that is to say, the possession of a great many outward Blessings, and the free|dom from temporal evils and inconveniences; the Proposition is not so universally true with reference to <HI>particular Persons,</HI> as it is with re|ference to <HI>Nations</HI> and <HI>Kingdoms.</HI> For every Man that fears God is not always blessed with happy outward Circumstances. On the con|trary, some good Men are exposed to many and great Afflictions, and Misfortunes, and Sicknesses, and Crosses, all their lives long. But it is certainly true of all <HI>Nations</HI> and <HI>Peoples</HI> whatsoever. Every Nation or Society shall fare better or worse in this World, exactly, according as they fear God, or despise and af|front him; exactly, according to the degree they keep God's Commandments, or break them. Though it is not certain, that every particular Man shall always do so. And
<PB N="14" REF="9">
there is great reason that it should be thus. For</P>
<P>First, We know that all God's ways are just and equal. Now as to <HI>particular Persons,</HI> there is a great room left for the dispensing this Justice and Equity to them. For they being in their natures made to live for ever, it is e|nough for the vindicating God's Justice, that they be at any time hereafter, either rewarded for their Piety and Virtue, or punished for their Wickedness and abuse of God's Mercies. So that wicked Men may be happy and pro|sperous here, and good Men may suffer many afflictions and tribulations, without any the least reflection on the Justice or Goodness of the great Governour of the World: Because there is a farther day reserved for the adjusting all Mens Rewards according to their Works.</P>
<P>But now the consideration of publick <HI>So|cieties</HI> and <HI>Nations,</HI> is quite different. Nati|ons are not made to be Immortal, but end with this World. No Society, as a Society, shall be called to a future account. But all the Rewards and Punishments, they are capable of as Societies, must be adjudged and distribu|ted to them in this present Life. And there|fore if we suppose God to be the Judge and
<PB N="15" REF="9">
Governour of the World, and of all the Nati|ons in it; as well as he is the Judge and Go|vernour of particular Persons: We must like|wise suppose, that he administers all affairs so, that Righteous and Religious Nations have in this World the reward of their Virtue in the blessings of Peace and Plenty, and all manner of temporal Prosperity: And on the other side, impious and incorrigible Nations are like|wise punished in this World for their wicked|ness, either by severe Judgments, or by a to|tal destruction; as God in his infinite Wisdom sees cause.</P>
<P>This now that I have offered is I think so reasonable, that if there was no more to be said, it ought to go a great way towards the making of the point I have in hand highly cre|dible. But in the <HI>second</HI> place there is a great deal more to be said. The word of God doth all along bear testimony to the truth of this. A multitude of Texts of Scripture there are, that do most plainly give this account of God's dealing with Nations and Peoples, that I have now mentioned.</P>
<P>There is no Judgment threatned to any Nation in the holy Scripture (and abundance of Nations are there threatned) but it is upon
<PB N="16" REF="10">
account of the sins and wickedness they were guilty of. Which sins, if they repented of, so repented as to forsake them, they might find mercy.</P>
<P>And accordingly we find in fact, that God always dealt with Peoples and Nations accord|ing to these measures. God had solemnly de|nounced destruction to the City of <HI>Ninive,</HI> by his Prophet, and that within forty days. But upon the Repentance of the <HI>Ninevites,</HI> and turning to God with all their hearts, he rever|sed his Sentence (though to the great discon|tent of the Prophet) and gave them a further time.</P>
<P>On the other side he waited long for the Repentance of the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> but would not destroy them; because their sins, though very hainous, admitted a place for Repentance. But when their iniquities were filled up to the measures, according to which God proceeds in his destruction of Nations; He then sent the <HI>Israelites</HI> to root them out, and to take pos|session of their Land.</P>
<P>And thus was <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> raised up by God to be a scourge to all the Nations about him, for the punishment of their sins. <HI>Nebu|chadnezzar</HI> had indeed other things in his head.
<PB N="17" REF="10">
That which he designed was, the gratifying his own Ambition, and enlarging his Domi|nions. But these were not the ends which God had to serve by him. God made use of him as his Instrument, as his Servant (and so he calls him) for the rendring to the Nations that just recompence of vengeance which their sins called for.</P>
<P>I mention these things the rather, because they are instances of God's dealing with Hea|then Nations, who were under no particular Covenant with God.</P>
<P>And I might have recourse likewise to the Histories of all Nations, to shew the truth of this. Name any Nation that was ever remark|able for Justice; for Temperance, and seve|rity of Manners; for Piety and Religion (though it was in a wrong way); that did not always thrive and grow great in the World; and that did not always enjoy a plentiful por|tion of all those things which are accounted to make a Nation Happy and Flourishing. And on the other side, when that Nation has declined from its former Virtue, and grown impious or dissolute in manners, we appeal to Experience, whether it has not likewise always proportion|ably sunk in its Success and good Fortunes. I
<PB N="18" REF="11">
am sure any one that will be at the pains to read either the <HI>Greek,</HI> or the <HI>Roman,</HI> or even the <HI>Turkish</HI> History, will meet with matter e|nough there, to satisfy him of the truth of this observation.</P>
<P>But I confine my self to the Scripture, and in that the History of the <HI>Iews</HI> is the most re|markable, for indeed it makes up a great part of the Old Testament. Now in that History it is worth our taking notice of; That every degree of publick Vice, and departure from God's Laws, was always punished with pub|lick Judgments. And on the other side, every degree of publick Repentance and Reformati|on, was always rewarded with publick Hap|piness and Prosperity. So that any one that could make a right estimate of the Morals of that Nation, and how it stood as to Virtue and Vice; might constantly make a judgment likewise how it would fare with them, as to their outward temporal affairs.</P>
<P>I must confess that generally speaking, there is little force in those Arguments that are drawn from Examples; But in the case I am now upon, I think there is a great weight in them. For though we cannot argue from God's dealing with one Person, that he will just
<PB N="19" REF="11">
deal in the same manner with another: Yet as to Nations and Kingdoms, the case is other|wise, as I before said. For God's dispensations and Providences to them, seem all to proceed upon one immutable Foundation (which will be the same in all Ages and Countreys) name|ly the expression and vindication of his Justice and Goodness in this World.</P>
<P>And for my part, I have always been of this mind, That there is no other difference be|tween the History of God's dealings with his own People the Jews, and that of other Na|tions, but this: That in other Nations the publick Events that happen'd, whether good or bad, though they were taken notice of, yet they passed without any reflection on the true causes from whence they proceeded. The Historians did indeed often lay their Fingers rightly upon the immediate, visible, outward occasions, or means, or instruments, from whence their good or bad Fortune was derived to them. But they searched no further. They considered only second Causes, and took no great notice of the first and principal Cause of all things, God Almighty, and his influencing humane affairs. They left God in a great measure out of their Hypothesis, and out of
<PB N="20" REF="12">
their History. But now that the World might be awaken'd to a more hearty belief and sense of his Providence, God took care to single out the Nation of the Jews; and in them to give us a true Pattern or Platform of his dealings with all the Nations of the World. And for that purpose he ordered, that all the great strokes, both of their departure from God, and of their return to him; And likewise both of the good or bad Fortune, that did at any time befal that Nation, should be faithfully Registred, and the true Causes of them faith|fully assigned; That all Mankind might from thence receive Instruction how they ought to behave themselves towards God; and what according to their different behaviours they were to expect.</P>
<P>To conclude this point: By all that hath been said it appears, That the State, and Con|dition, and Fortune of all Kingdoms and Na|tions, is the very same with that of the Jews, as it is represented by <HI>Achior</HI> the <HI>Ammonite,</HI> in the advice he gave to <HI>Holofernes,</HI> when he came up with an Army against that People. You have the passage in <HI>Iudith</HI> 5.17. <HI>Whilst</HI> (saith he) <HI>these People sinned not before their God, they prospered; because the God that hateth iniquity, was
<PB N="21" REF="12">
with them. But when they departed from the way that he appointed them, they were destroyed in many Bat|tels, after a wonderful sort, and were led Captives in|to a land that was not theirs. But now they are turned to their God, and are come up from their Captivity, and have again possessed</HI> Jerusalem. <HI>Now therefore my Lord and Governour, if there be any fault in this People, so that they have sinned against their God; let us consider that this shall be their ruin, and let us go up that we may overcome them. But if there be no iniquity in this People, let my Lord pass by, lest their Lord defend them, and their God be for them; and we become a reproach before all the World.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it is, and will be always with all States and Nations, if they notoriously sin a|gainst their God, this will be their ruin. But if there be not found iniquity in them, it is in vain for any Enemy to set upon them; for God will be for them, and their Lord will defend them.</P>
<P>If this which I have said be not sufficient to satisfy any one about the truth of this point; I might bring other Proofs for it. I might for instance in the <HI>third</HI> place insist upon this, That Virtue and Piety do in their own nature tend to promote the wellfare and happiness of Peoples and Nations. As on the other hand,
<PB N="22" REF="13">
all Vice and Irreligion, is destructive of hu|mane Society. And this without respect to any appointment or Decree of God, that things should be managed in this way; but purely in the very nature of the thing.</P>
<P>It is obvious, That Virtue and Religion lay the surest Foundation for all those Blessings wherein the happiness of a Nation doth con|sist, that is possible; both by making Magi|strates to govern well, and by rendring the People easy to be governed. And likewise by furnishing both the Governours and the go|verned, with such kind of Principles and Ha|bits as cannot fail with the Blessing of God to produce both Peace, and Plenty, and Victory, and all other sorts of Prosperity in a Nation.</P>
<P>As on the other hand, all Vice, and Wick|edness, and Profaneness, and Impiety, do sow the worst Seeds in the World for the dissolving and breaking in pieces all Societies; or at least, for the so enfeebling them, that they shall ei|ther be in a very low wretched condition a|mong themselves, if they have no Enemies; or if they have any, become an easy prey to the next Invader.</P>
<P>But I will not enter upon this Argument, because I think the matter needs no further
<PB N="23" REF="13">
proof. And I would spend the rest of my time, in making some Application of what hath been said upon this point, to the business of our present meeting on this day.</P>
<P>WE are here met together for the so|lemn Humiliation of our selves with <HI>Fasting</HI> and <HI>Prayer,</HI> before Almighty God: In order to the Supplicating his Divine Majesty for the Pardon of our Sins, and the Sins of our Nation; And the imploring his Blessing and Protection to the King and Kingdom, by con|tinuing those Mercies to us we do enjoy; by averting those Judgments from us we have rea|son to fear; and more particularly by giving a Happy Issue to that dangerous War in which his Majesty, with the Kingdom, is now en|gaged.</P>
<P>And very great reason there is, that you the <HI>Representatives</HI> of the People of <HI>England,</HI> should most seriously, and solemnly, join in this Religious Office; since the Fortunes of the Nation you represent, did never more lie at stake than at this present.</P>
<P>You have hitherto been acting and endea|vouring for the Happiness and Security of your Nation by <HI>Humane</HI> Methods, and we all put
<PB N="24" REF="14">
up our daily Prayers, that what you have done, and what you shall do, may be <HI>for the Glory of God, and the good of his Church; and the Safety, Ho|nour and Wellfare of their Majesties, and their King|doms.</HI> And we hope all will so come to pass.</P>
<P>But now on this day, both <HI>You</HI> and <HI>We,</HI> are to think of other Methods, for the procuring Success to our Affairs. Namely, by having re|course to God Almighty; who when we have done all that we can, is the Governour of the World, and will do what he pleaseth. But yet will always do that which is best for Man|kind, and that too which is best for our Nation, if we be capable objects of his Favour. And to make our selves such, if it be possible, is our Business on this Day.</P>
<P>This is indeed a seasonable Business at all times; but at this time it seems absolutely ne|cessary. Since we have reason to apprehend the <HI>Crisis</HI> of our Nation, as to <HI>Happiness</HI> or <HI>Ruin,</HI> to be upon the point of approaching.</P>
<P>The Judgments of God are now abroad in the World. We have not only Rumours of Wars sounding in our Ears, but all <HI>Europe</HI> is now in an actual War, and a terrible one. And what the Consequences will be we know not.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="14">Some very great thing God certainly de|signs to bring to pass in these parts of the World, and that very suddenly. A Cup he has mingled for all the Nations to drink of. Which to some undoubtedly will prove a bit|ter Potion, a <HI>Cup</HI> of God's <HI>Wrath</HI> and <HI>Fury</HI>; to others probably a <HI>Cup of Salvation.</HI> But how it will prove to us, is yet entirely in the Will of God. However this is certain, that we of this Nation shall have as much our share in it, be it good or bad, as any other in Christen|dome.</P>
<P>And now after the mention of this, Can there be any need to call upon any one to <HI>weeping</HI> and <HI>fasting,</HI> and <HI>mourning,</HI> and <HI>crying mightily to the Lord, that he would have mercy upon us, and spare us,</HI> and our Nation, and <HI>not give his Heritage over to Confusion.</HI> Why methinks the Circumstances we are in, should put us upon so doing, without any other Monitors. Indeed we have no Humanity, no Compassi|on for our selves or our Country, if we do not.</P>
<P>We should all be of this mind if we did se|riously consider how things stand with us.</P>
<P>We are not that Innocent, Virtuous, Pious People, that may certainly reckon upon God's
<PB N="26" REF="15">
Favour, and think our selves in all Cases sure of his Protection. For if the Doctrine I have now been insisting on to you, be true Do|ctrine; then we of this Nation can but enter|tain very small hopes of being Happy and Pro|sperous. Nay, we cannot but apprehend Mi|sery and Ruin, and Desolation to our selves; unless God be abundantly more merciful to us than we deserve. And there can be no way to prevail with him to be so, but an universal <HI>Humiliation</HI> and <HI>Repentance.</HI> And this is the Ap|plication I desire to make of the Point I have been now treating of.</P>
<P>If the measure of God's dealing with Nati|ons be always according to the <HI>Moral</HI> State of them. If their <HI>good Fortunes</HI> be dealt out to them according to their <HI>Virtues</HI>; and <HI>Iudgments</HI> be inflicted upon them, according to their pro|voking God by their <HI>Sins</HI>; as we have said: Good Lord! What a lamentable Prospect have we of this Kingdom of what may come upon us? And what infinite reason have we there|upon, immediately to try all the ways that are possible of making our Peace with God, that so <HI>Iniquity may not be our ruin.</HI></P>
<P>I beg leave to dwell a little upon this Point, because it is the proper Argument of the day.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="15">
I do not say, nor do I think, that we of this Nation are worse than our Neighbours. But this I say, considering how long God hath spared us, and how long we have enjoyed the Blessings of Peace and Plenty, and all sorts of Prosperity (though perhaps with many Fears and just Apprehensions of danger); whilst most of our Neighbours have been harassed with Wars, and exposed to all the Cruelties and Miseries of Persecutions and Devastations: And considering the great Priviledges and Ad|vantages we have for many years enjoyed, of all the outward <HI>means</HI> of <HI>Grace,</HI> that could be desired for the Eternal Salvation of our Souls, and that above any other Nation under Hea|ven; And withal, how unprofitable we have been under these <HI>means,</HI> how unthankful to God for them, and what little effect they have had upon us for the bettering our Manners. And lastly, Considering how very wicked we generally are, what a World of open gross Sins and Impieties do reign among us, and what a lewd, Profane, Hypocritical, Athe|istical Spirit seems to have gone out into the Nation, and to prevail upon it. I say, these things considered, we cannot make any very comfortable Reflections on our own Condi|tion.
<PB N="28" REF="16">
So far from that, that if (as I said) the measure of God's dealings with Nations be ta|ken from their Behaviours and moral Quali|ties, and be suited to their merits and deserts, we have as little to hope for as most Nations under Heaven.</P>
<P>I take no delight in saying these things; on the contrary it is very grievous: But if ever one may be allowed to run out into a <HI>Decla|mation</HI> against the <HI>Vices</HI> of the <HI>Times,</HI> it is upon such an occasion as this, and before such an Audience as this, that the liberty may be chal|lenged.</P>
<P>For God's sake let us not deceive our selves; nor think that we are the Favourites of Heaven, meerly because we profess the <HI>Best Religion,</HI> and are Members of the <HI>Best Church</HI> in the World.</P>
<P>For as good as our Church and Religion is, and as zealous as we seem to be for them; yet never did <HI>Vice</HI> and <HI>Iniquity</HI> of all sorts, and in|deed every thing that is contrary to our holy Religion, more abound in this Nation than at this day.</P>
<P>Give me leave to speak out upon this occa|sion, and to tell you of some of the <HI>Crying Sins</HI> that reign among us, and that deserve <HI>Your Care</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="16">
to put a stop to; and which, if they be conti|nued in, will certainly bring down the Ven|geance of God upon us.</P>
<P>Where was there ever more <HI>Atheism</HI> and <HI>In|fidelity</HI> to be seen in a Country that professed the Religion of Jesus Christ, than is among us at this day?</P>
<P>We do not perhaps meet with very many that do openly affirm, <HI>There is no God</HI>: For as bad as we are, God be thanked we are not yet arrived to such Impudence. That is such an affront to the <HI>Laws</HI> and to all <HI>good Manners,</HI> that it is not to be born with. But we may meet with several, every day, that do affirm the same thing by consequence; asserting such Principles from whence it may be necessarily concluded.</P>
<P>For my part, I account it much the same thing, as to the ill effects of the Opinion, to deny the Being of <HI>God</HI>; as to deny the Being of <HI>Angels,</HI> and <HI>Spirits,</HI> and <HI>Immaterial Souls</HI>; to deny the Being of <HI>particular Providence</HI>; to deny the natural difference between <HI>good</HI> and <HI>evil</HI>; to deny another Life after this, wherein good Men shall be rewarded, and wicked Men pu|nished; to deny the liberty of <HI>Humane Actions,</HI> and to say, that all things which we do, we
<PB N="30" REF="17">
do by a fatal necessity, and we cannot do o|therwise: And yet we may every day meet with Men of these Principles, nay, and that laugh at all those that maintain the con|trary.</P>
<P>But then, as for the business of <HI>Iesus Christ,</HI> and that which we call the Christian Religion, what a very little do a great many among us make of that? To talk of Christ's being sent for the Saviour of the World, and that he di|ed to procure the Pardon of our Sins, and that we must believe all the Scripture-Doctrines concerning him, and worship him as a God; why what <HI>stuff</HI> is this to a great many of the refined Spirits of our Age? It is very well if they can so far prevail with themselves, as to own the Being of God, and to acknowledge their obligation to the Duties of moral Honesty and Justice, which <HI>natural</HI> Re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">igion teacheth: But as for <HI>Iesus Christ</HI> and the <HI>Trinity,</HI> and the <HI>Sacraments,</HI> and all <HI>revealed</HI> Religion; they beg your Pardon for these things, they are too nice and subtil for them to meddle with. Not but that they are good Christians all the while. For they can come to our Churches, and to our Sacraments too, if there be occasion. Be|cause indeed they will always be of the Reli|gion
<PB N="31" REF="17">
of the Country where they live. But at the same time they do this; they do no more really believe, or expect any Spiritual Benefit in our Religion, nor look for any more <HI>Sal|vation</HI> from <HI>Christ Iesus,</HI> than they would ex|pect from <HI>Mahomet,</HI> if they should live in <HI>Turky.</HI></P>
<P>But this is not all. Even among those that do believe in Jesus Christ, and own his Reli|gion; yet what little regard have they, ge|nerally speaking, to his Worship and Ser|vice.</P>
<P>It is very well if they now and then afford their presence on <HI>Sundays</HI> at the publick Religi|ous Assemblies. I will not examine with what designs, and for what ends they come thither, nor how devoutly and religiously their hearts are affected during the time they are there. I say it is very well that they are there at all.</P>
<P>But even of those that do come thither, and do once a Week seem to have a sense of pub|lick Religion, I say how few are there of them that take any care of worshipping God, either in their <HI>Families,</HI> or in their <HI>Closets</HI>?</P>
<P>Why, if a Man was truly Religious, he could not pass a day without solemn Addres|ses
<PB N="32" REF="18">
to his <HI>Maker,</HI> and to his <HI>Redeemer.</HI> He would pray in his Closet constantly; and if he had a Family, he would pray with them con|stantly. And if he had no Family, he would constantly resort to those places where he might pay his Tribute of publick Prayer and Praises to God, unless he had urgent business to hinder him.</P>
<P>But, is there any thing of this to be seen among us, except in some few persons here and there? Are there not twenty Families for one that live without so much as the shew of any Devotion? Without any sort of Prayer or Worship of God in their Houses? Nay, and I am afraid, I may say, there are twenty for one, even of private Persons, that live without De|votion in their Closets; that never call upon God, never renew their vows to their Savi|our, never pay him any Homage, except per|haps once a Week in a formal way, when the Custom of the Country obliges them to re|sort to the Church.</P>
<P>The truth is, so little sense have most of us of Religion and Devotion; so little regard of our Duty to God, and our dependance upon him, and expressing that dependance, either in private, or in our Families: That were it
<PB N="33" REF="18">
not for that <HI>Happy</HI> Institution of the <HI>Lord's day,</HI> on the which we are obliged, by the Laws of God and Man, to meet together for the Wor|ship of God; we should hardly see any Face of Religion among us, and in a little time should scarce be distinguished from Heathens.</P>
<P>But yet this is not the worst of our Case. Our gross <HI>Immoralities</HI>; that Horrid <HI>Lewdness</HI> and <HI>De|bauchery</HI> that is every where to be observed in our days, doth still increase our Guilt, and cry to Heaven for Judgment upon our Nation.</P>
<P>It would make a Man's heart ake, that has any sense of God or Religion, to think of the <HI>Riots,</HI> the <HI>Drunkenness,</HI> the continued course of spending our time, and our Parts, and our substance, in <HI>Revelling</HI> and <HI>Gaming,</HI> and all manner of such excesses that is daily practised among us. And yet at the same time, the Men that thus live, think themselves very honest Men all the while.</P>
<P>It would really amaze a Man, and put him upon admiring God's Patience, that he doth not presently confound the World, if he did seriously reflect on the many <HI>filthy, lewd</HI> Speeches and Actions; the numerous wicked intrigues of <HI>Lust,</HI> the Infamous <HI>Whoredoms</HI> and <HI>Adulteries</HI> that are, without any sense of shame, daily
<PB N="34" REF="19">
carried on and acted among us, and that by Person too that have the Face to shew them|selves at our Holy Assemblies.</P>
<P>Especially, if to these be added, the infinite <HI>Lies,</HI> and <HI>Cheats,</HI> and <HI>Perjuries,</HI> which our Land groans under. The Blasphemous <HI>Oaths</HI> and <HI>Imprecations,</HI> the <HI>Damn me's</HI> and <HI>Sink me's</HI>; the Horrid Prosanations of the Name of God, and all things Sacred, that are in every place, in every street where we pass, belched out, in contempt of the <HI>Almighty</HI> and his Laws; by all sorts of <HI>Persons,</HI> of all sorts of <HI>Qualities</HI>; from the <HI>Beggar</HI> in the street to the <HI>Man</HI> of <HI>Honour,</HI> and that for no other reason in the World, but because it is their Humour or their Custom.</P>
<P>And lastly, to fill up the measure of our ini|quities; to our other reigning Vices, we have added that of <HI>Hypocrisy</HI> too; which one would think should not often be found among so much <HI>Profaneness.</HI></P>
<P>How many of us make a mighty noise with <HI>Religion,</HI> and are Zealous even to <HI>Bigottry,</HI> in the defence of it, and yet have not one grane of inward sense of what it obligeth them to&punc; Nay so far from that that if <HI>Religion</HI> be but in their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ouths: If they do but appear Zealous enough for the <HI>Protestant Cause</HI>; If they can but
<PB N="35" REF="19">
cry loud enough, <HI>The Temple of the Lord, The Temple of the Lord,</HI> as the Jews did in the Pro|phet; They matter not, how contradictory their Actions are to the Precepts of that Reli|gion they do profess. Their Zeal for so good a Cause, will sanctify all their other Actions, be they never so wicked and unjust.</P>
<P>But if this be not <HI>Hypocrisy,</HI> there is no such thing in the World. Sure I am, it was this sort of Carriage, that God so often reproves the Jews for, by his Prophets; and upon account of which they are so often reproached as a Ge|neration of <HI>Hypocrites,</HI> and for which he threat|ens them with utter destruction.</P>
<P>O my Brethren, what have we to say to these things? If the Case be thus with us, as I am afraid it is; What Plea have we to put in for our selves? If God should let loose our Enemies upon us, the Enemies of our <HI>Nation,</HI> and of our <HI>Religion,</HI> and should give us over as a Prey unto them, what have we to reply? Truly nothing that I know of, except that of the Psalmist, <HI>Righteous art thou, O Lord, and Iust are thy Iudgments.</HI></P>
<P>But we trust God's Lenity, and Forbear|ance, and Mercy, is as great to <HI>Publick Societies</HI> and <HI>Kingdoms,</HI> as it is to <HI>Private Persons</HI>; And,
<PB N="36" REF="20">
that we may apply those expressions to our Nation which <HI>David</HI> uttered, with reference to himself: <HI>O Lord, if thou shouldst be extream to mark what is done amiss, O Lord, who may abide it? But there is Mercy with thee, that thou mayest be feared.</HI></P>
<P>When the Iniquities of a People are at the full, God will not fail to punish them. But whether ours be so or no, He only knows. We hope, though they be very <HI>grievous</HI> and <HI>crying,</HI> they have not yet exceeded the measure of God's Patience; and that there is yet left a place for Repentance. This is indeed the only <HI>Plank</HI> we have to trust to, that can save us from <HI>Shipwrack</HI>; and therefore we ought to lay hold upon it.</P>
<P>Let us therefore this day, every one of us; If we have any kindness for our Native Coun|try: If we have any respect to that dear Place, where we and our Ancestors, and all our Re|lations and Kindred for many Generations have lived so happily:</P>
<P>If we have any Zeal for, or regard to that excellent <HI>Church,</HI> and that Holy <HI>Religion,</HI> that God did in so extraordinary a manner plant a|mong us; and for the preserving of which in our Land, His Care and Providence hath so often and so wonderfully appear'd:</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="20">If we have any Concernment for many thou|sands of innocent Souls, who without their own fault may deeply suffer for the Nations Sins:</P>
<P>Lastly, If we have any Bowels of Compas|sion to those dear Children of ours, that God hath given us, that we may transmit to them and their Children after them, that <HI>Birth-right,</HI> and those <HI>Priviledges,</HI> and that excellent <HI>Reli|gion</HI> we received from our Fathers:</P>
<P>I say, if we have any sense of these things, let every one of us this day, most sincerely ap|ply our selves to the Service of God, in all the ways of a serious Virtue and Piety. Or if we have been careless of this matter heretofore; or which is worse, have been lewd or wicked in our lives; yet let us now at last heartily re|pent of it. And with <HI>Prayers</HI> and <HI>Tears,</HI> and the most solemn <HI>Resolutions</HI> of <HI>Amendment,</HI> pro|strate our selves before the Throne of Grace; imploring and beseeching God's Pardon and Forgiveness, and&punc; if it be possible, <HI>a lengthening of our Tranquillity.</HI></P>
<P>O let us not refuse this Opportunity of do|ing the greatest Kindness, and the best service to our Country that we possibly can. And there|fore let us not only heartily bewail our own
<PB N="38" REF="21">
Sins, but the reigning Impieties and Wicked|ness, that our Nation stands accountable for.</P>
<P>Now is the time, if ever, that we are all concerned to be importunate with God for our selves and our Country.</P>
<P>And a fitter <HI>Prayer</HI> for this purpose cannot be composed for us, than that which <HI>Daniel</HI> put up to God for his Nation, and that at such a solemn time as this, when, as he tells us, he had <HI>set himself to seek God, for his People, by Prayer and Supplication, with Fasting, and Sackcloth and Ashes.</HI></P>
<P>The Prayer is in the 9^t^h Chapter of his Pro|phecy; and I shall conclude with it, and I earnestly beg of you all, to join with me in it.</P>
<Q><P><HI>O Lord the great and dreadful God, that keepest the Covenant, and shewest mercy to them that love thee, and to them that keep thy Commandments.</HI></P>
<P><HI>We have sinned and done wickedly, and have commit|ted Iniquity, and have rebelled; even by departing from thy Precepts, and from thy Iudgments.</HI></P>
<P><HI>O Lord, Righteousness belongeth unto thee; but unto us confusion of face as at this day; to the Men of</HI> Judah, <HI>and to the Inhabitants of</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>be|cause we have sinned against thee.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="21"><HI>But unto the Lord our God belongeth Mercy and Forgiveness, though we have rebelled against him; neither have we obeyed the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in his Laws which he set before us.</HI></P>
<P><HI>O Lord, according to all thy Righteousness, we beseech thee, let thy anger and thy fury be turned away from thy City</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>thy holy Mountain. Because for our sins, and the iniquities of our Fathers,</HI> Jerusalem <HI>and thy People are become a reproach to all that are about us.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Now therefore, O God, hear the Prayer of thy Servants, and cause thy Face to shine upon thy San|ctuary.</HI></P>
<P><HI>O God incline thine ear and hear: Open thine Eyes, and behold the City which is called by thy Name.</HI></P>
<P><HI>O Lord hear. O Lord forgive. O Lord hearken and do. Defer not for thy own sake, O our God. For thy City, and thy People, are called by thy Name.</HI></P></Q>
<P>And whilst <HI>Daniel</HI> was thus praying, and confessing his sins, and the sins of his People unto the Lord, and supplicating for his City <HI>Ierusalem</HI>: Behold the Angel <HI>Gabriel</HI> was sent unto him from the Lord, with the glad tidings that God had heard his Prayer for <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and that it should be built, and the Lord would dwell in it.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="22">O may we all thus <HI>fast</HI> and <HI>pray,</HI> as <HI>Daniel</HI> did, and may God Almighty give us such a return of our Prayers, <HI>Amen, O God for Iesus Christ his sake, to whom,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
