<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS
UPON THE
CITIES
OF
LONDON and ROME.</HEAD>
<P>1. THAT before the year
1630, the Christnings at
<HI>London</HI> exceeded the Bu|rials
of the same, but about the
year 1655 they were scarce half;
and now about two thirds.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="3">2. Before the Restauration of
Monarchy in <HI>England, Anno</HI> 1660,
the People of <HI>Paris</HI> were more
than those of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Dublin</HI>
put together, whereas now, the
People of <HI>London</HI> are more than
those of <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> or of <HI>Pa|ris</HI>
and <HI>Rouen.</HI></P>
<P>3. <HI>Anno</HI> 1665 one fifth part of
the then People of <HI>London</HI> or 97
thousand died of the Plague, and
in the next year 1666, 13 thou|sand
Houses or one fifth part of
all the Housing of <HI>London</HI> were
burnt also.</P>
<P>4. At the Birth of <HI>Christ,</HI> old
<HI>Rome</HI> was the greatest City of the
World, and <HI>London</HI> the greatest
<PB N="3" REF="3">
at the Coronation of King <HI>Iames</HI>
the Second, and near 6 times as
great as the present <HI>Rome,</HI> where|in
are 119 thousand Souls besides
<HI>Iews.</HI></P>
<P>5. In the years of King <HI>Charles</HI>
the Second his death and King
<HI>Iames</HI> the Second his Coronation
(which were neither of them re|markable
for extraordinary Sickli|ness
or Healthfulness) the Burials
did wonderfully agree, <HI>viz. Anno</HI>
1684, they were 23202, and
<HI>Anno</HI> 1685 they were 23222, the
<HI>Medium</HI> whereof is 23212. And
the Christnings did very wonder|fully
agree also, having been <HI>Anno</HI>
1684, 14702, and <HI>Anno</HI> 1685,
14732, the <HI>Medium</HI> whereof is
14716, which consistence was
<PB N="4" REF="4">
never seen before, the said num|ber
of 23212 Burials making the
People of <HI>London</HI> to be 696360,
at the rate of one Dying <HI>per an|num</HI>
out of 30.</P>
<P>6. Since the great Fire of <HI>Lon|don,
Anno</HI> 1666 about 7 parts of
15 of the present vast City hath
been new built, and is with its
People increased near one half,
and become equal to <HI>Paris</HI> and
<HI>Rome</HI> put together, the one be|ing
the Seat of the great <HI>French</HI>
Monarchy and the other of the
Papacy.</P>
