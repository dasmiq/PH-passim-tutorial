<P>BURY-FAIR. A COMEDY, As it is ACTED by His Majesty's Servants.</P>

<HEAD>TO CHARLES EARL of <HI>DORSET</HI> and <HI>MIDDLESEX,</HI> Lord Chamberlain of His Majesty's Houshold, Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Sussex,</HI> and one of the most Honourable Privy Council.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> Who have been so long and so continually oblig'd by your Lordship, have ever fresh Occasions of ac|knowledging your Favour and Bounty to me, and cannot be silent of the late great Honour you have done me, in making me the King's Servant; but must publish my Gratitude for that, and all the rest of the great Obligations I have receiv'd. Your Lordship not only makes use of your own Power, but of that which the King has entrusted you with, to do good to Man|kind, which you ever delighted in. And as I am apt to believe, that no Man had ever a great Office con|ferr'd upon him with more Favour from his Prince, so I am well assured no Man ever receiv'd one with a more general liking of the People than your Lordship. Nothing but the Service of so Great and Gracious a
<PB REF="3">
King, who so miraculously redeem'd us, and since makes all our Interests his own, could recompence you for the happy Retirement you might enjoy, and wherein you so much delight.</P>
<P>This Play, my Lord, I humbly submit to your Lordships Iudgment. I can write nothing worthy of your Acceptance; but I hope your Lordship will give some Indulgence to this, since it was Written during eight Months painful Sickness, wherein all the several Days in which I was able to Write any part of a Scene, amounted not to one Month, except some few which were employ'd in indispensable Business. This is indeed no Excuse in any one who does not Write for Necessities of Life.</P>
<P>The Play has met with a Kind Reception from all for ought I hear, but some of the late Loyal Poets, above whose Censure I esteem my self; and from some who are still so fond of the Doctrine of <HI>Passive Obedience</HI> and <HI>Non-resistance,</HI> that they think it a Profana|tion to bring the very words into a Comedy.</P>
<P>These are so weak to mistake that for a Point of Divinity, which is indeed a Point of Law; and some of the most vigorous Maintainers of that Doctrine, have seen their Errour, and not only left off professing it, but have wisely and justly Contradicted it in their Pra|ctice,
<PB REF="3">
b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> assisting towards our late wonderful Delive|rance. And sure there is no need of any great measure of understanding to find out, that, when the Compact on which Government is founded is broken, and those very Laws destroy'd, which were made to secure the People in their Estates, Liberty and Religion, the Law of Na|ture must take place, which not only permits, but ob|liges Mankind to Self-defence.</P>
<P>I never could Recant in the worst of Times, when my Ruine was design'd, and my Life was sought, and for rear Ten years I was kept from the exercise of that Profession which had afforded me a competent Subsistence, and surely I shall not now do it, when there is a Liberty of speaking Common Sence, which tho' not long since forbidden, is now grown Current.</P>
<P>I humbly beg your Lordship's Pardon for the trou|ble of this Epistle, who am,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>MY LORD, <HI>Your Lordship's most Obliged Humble Servant,</HI> Tho. Shadwell.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE,</HEAD>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mr. <HI>Mountfort.</HI></STAGE>
<L>TO what hard Laws you Comick Writers bind,</L>
<L>Who must at every turn new humour find;</L>
<L>Tho' the great Masters of the former Age,</L>
<L>Had all the choice of humour for the Stage:</L>
<L>And they that plenteous Harvest reap'd so clean,</L>
<L>Their Successors can little else but glean.</L>
<L>Frolick, and <HI>Cockwood</HI> yet were good and new,</L>
<L>And the Plain-dealer, and Sir <HI>Foplin</HI> you</L>
<L>Have seen, and justly have applauded too.</L>
<L>Our Author some new humour did produce,</L>
<L>But look not for an unexhausted Cruse.</L>
<L>The task each day grows harder than before;</L>
<L>For as good Poets have brought forth great store,</L>
<L>So Fellows of no <HI>Genius,</HI> with much Toil,</L>
<L>Still Sweat for humour, which they always spoil:</L>
<L>And by their hints good <HI>Comick</HI> Pens prevent,</L>
<L>As Whelps stanch Hounds, by foyling of the scent.</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">hese wretched <HI>Poetitos,</HI> who got praise</L>
<L>For writing most <HI>confounded Loyal</HI> Plays,</L>
<L>With viler, courser Iests than at Bear-Garden,</L>

<P>NOW I hope, Sir, you will acknowledge you see a sweet Town, clean, and finely Scituated, in a delicate Air; here I was Born, here I Suck'd my first Breath.</P>
</SP>

<P>Thus every Coxcomb is big with the praise of the Country and Place of his Nativity.</P>

<P>All the World says as much of St. <HI>Edmand</HI>'s <HI>Bury.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is indeed some Truth in this; but 'tis not thou, but the Town, is in the right: for thou wou'dst have recommended the Air of the worst Town in the Hundreds of <HI>Essex,</HI> had'st thou Suck'd thy first breath in it, as thou sayest. But one thing I can tell of thy Town, That it can produce a Blockhead.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may say what you please of me, Sir, but there are so many fine Gentlemen and Ladies, so Gallant, and so well bred, we call it little <HI>London</HI>; and it out-does St. <HI>Iames</HI>'s <HI>Square,</HI> and all the Squares, in Dressing and Breed|ing; nay, even the Court it self, under the Rose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt not, but they are given to out-do, as all Imitators are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, you <HI>London</HI> Wits, will never give any Man, nor any thing, a good Word.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>You impudent Rascal! Wit, say you! What, do you call me Names? I had as leive be call'd a Pick-pocket, as a Wit. A Wit is always a Merry, Idle, Waggish Fellow, of no Understanding: Parts indeed he has, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">he had better be without 'em: Your solid Fop is a better Man; he'll be Diligent and Fawning, always in the way, and with his Blockhead do his business at last; but your Wit will either neglect all Opportunities for Pleasure, or if he brings his business into a hopeful way, he will laugh at, or draw his Wit up|on some great Man or other, and spoil all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wou'd I were a Wit for all that. But to give you an Example of the Wit and Breeding of our Town; there is the Lady <HI>Fantast,</HI> and her Daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="6">
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>The most perpetual, impertinent, pratling, conceited, affected Jades, that ever plagu'd Mankind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mercy on me! Impertinent! Why, they're the Flower of <HI>Bury.</HI> Is not the young Lady a Beauty too?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess, God has given her one good Face; but by her most insupportable Affectation, she screws it into twenty bad ones. She has naturally a good Complexion, becoming good Features; and she, by Art, makes her Face look like a new White Wall with a Red Lettice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, you'll grant Mr. <HI>Oldwit</HI> is a fine Facetious, Witty, Old Gen|tleman, my Lady <HI>Fantast</HI>'s Husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Almost as arrant an Ass, as thou art. He is a paltry Old-fashion'd Wit, and Punner of the last Age; that pretends to have been one of <HI>Ben Iohn&punc; son</HI>'s Sons, and to have seen Plays at the <HI>Blackfryers.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>You'll be Ston'd in the Streets, Sir, if you talk thus in <HI>Bury.</HI> I war|rant, you will not allow Sir <HI>Humphrey Noddy</HI> to be a Wit, and a fine Gentleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Blunt, Noisy, Laughing, Roaring, Drinking Fellow; as trouble|some as a Monky, and as Witless as a Jackdaw. He is, at best, but a Wag.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, say what you please, he is a fine Gentleman, and will make a Man burst a Vein to keep him Company; he has Wit at will, that's certain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>If the Rogue had no more Money at will, he'd dye in a Ditch.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will no body at <HI>Bury</HI> please you? What think you of Mr. <HI>Trim</HI>? he's accounted the finest Gentleman in all <HI>Bury,</HI> for Breeding and Civility, and the like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now you have hit on't: He is a most Compleat, and finish'd Fop: Na|ture has not been negligent, nor Art been Idle, in his Composition. He is very Wise, Reserv'd, full of Forms, and empty of Substance; all Ceremony, and no Sence: more troublesomly ill-bred with his Formality, than a High-shoo'd Peasant with his Roughness. Sir <HI>Noddy</HI> and he are two excellent Fops in Consort!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fops! Mercy upon me! You will be accounted a Mad-man, if you talk thus at <HI>Bury.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, among Fools.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, they are those that carry all the Town before 'em.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>No doubt on't, I never knew a Town yet, wherein the Fops do not carry all before 'em: They are a numerous, Impudent, and Noisy Party; while the Wise and Ingenious are Few, Modest and Reserv'd. There are Men of Wit, Honour, and Breeding; and Women of great Wit, Beauty, and Ingenuity, and Well-bred too, in this Town, which is really a sweet Town; but these pretend to nothing: Your pretenders never have any thing in 'em.</P>

<P>It is impossible that we of <HI>Bury,</HI> who I may say with modesty enough, have no small Fame for Breeding and Civility, can ever be so obnoxious to that Stupidity, or neglect of either, as not to value the great Honour done to us, and the cohonestation of us, by your arrival at <HI>Bury</HI> at this time of the Fair: Which will add to the wonted gayety and Splendour of the Place and Season.</P>

<P>You astonish me, with your most admirable Address, and Complai|sance: and I think there lives not, among the race of Mankind, a person more skilful in all Decencies of Behaviour, compleatness of Expression, Gestures of Body, Modulations of Voice, and all those Arts of Modish Gallantry, which might render a man the Mirror of Courts, and the Wonder and Example of all other places.

<P>Conversation! That is so frivolous, it were not to be born, but for something else that shall be nameless: and I'll tell you one thing, Mr. <HI>Trim,</HI> That any Woman you keep company with, who does not think you have a mind to lye with her, will never forgive you, to my knowledge.</P>

<P>Their Conversation does infinitely transcend mens, I assure you: I have study'd the Sex.</P>

<P>I'll tell you one thing more: That you must never be alone with a Woman, but you must offer, or she knows you care not for her: Five to one but she grants: But if she does not care for you, but denies, she's certain by that you care for her, and will esteem you the better ever after.</P>

<P>No, Nature has made you a VVit. VVhy do you take it ill? I think it the greatest Honour can be done to a Man.

<P>Come, my sweet Daughter, consider what I have said. Thou art in thy maturity of blooming Age; I have bred thee to the very Achme and Perfection of <HI>Bury</HI> Breeding, which is inferiour to none in this our Island; Dan|cing, Singing, <HI>Ghittar, French</HI> Master: And I'll say that for thee, my Jewel, thou hast Sacrific'd all thy Endeavours to attain thy Education; which, corrobo|rated: by thy Acuteness of Parts, have render'd thee exactly accomplish'd, and together with the excellence of thy Beauty, justly admir'd by the Amorous Males, and envy'd by the malicious Females.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>To all that, which the World calls Wit and Breeding, I have always had a natural tendency, a <HI>penchen,</HI> deriv'd, as the Learned say, <HI>Ex traduce,</HI> from your Ladyship: Besides the great Prevalence of your Ladyship's most shining Example, has perpetually Stimulated me, to the Sacrificing all my Endeavours towards the attaining of those inestimable Jewels; than which, no|thing in the Universe can be so much a <HI>mon gre,</HI> as the <HI>French</HI> say.

not quite gone; but thou hast those Attractions, which I bewail the want of: Poetry, Latin, and the French Tongue.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess, I have ever had a Tendress for the Muses, and have a due reverence for <HI>Helicon,</HI> and <HI>Parnassus,</HI> and the Graces: But Heroic Num|bers upon Love and Honour, are most Ravissant, most Suprenant; and a Tra|gedy is so Touchant! I dye at a Tragedy; I'll swear I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess, my dear, thy Wit has more of Notoriety, than thy Beauty; since the pretty various Diversions of thy Pen, have transmitted thy Fame of Wit, beyond the narrow limits of an Island. But it is now high time to manifest thy Judgment, in the disposal of thy Person; and thou hast rejected a Multitude of Lovers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am so much indebted to Nature and Education, that I am resolv'd not unequally to dispose of that Person, which (without vanity I may say) Na|ture by its genuine Bounty, and Art by its friendly Additions, have rendred not <HI>disagreeable,</HI> or void of <HI>Attraits</HI>: But all want of VVit and Breeding, does affect me with that unconquerable <HI>Chagrin,</HI> that, eh Gud, I cannot suffer such Fellows.</P>

<P>Ever while you live; and your Serjeants, and Doctors of Divinity: the last time I Din'd in such company, I told a Story of a Doctor of Divinity, whose Wife us'd to entertain him with three Dishes every day; Bitter, Pout, and Tart. There was such a Laughing, they Roar'd out again: The Ladies Tyhee'd under their Napkins; I am the Son of a Whore, if the Tyhee did not take a reverend old Gentlewoman as she was a Drinking, and she squirted out the Beer out of her Nose, as an <HI>Indian</HI> does Tobacco.

<P>You have so; but there's great enquiry made after you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>We were bad enough with our Punning Fools; but that new Detach|ment of Drunkards and Visitants, made 'em compleatly the most confounded Company I ever was condemn'd to. Here are the fruits of the Country! Pre|thee, my Dear Peer, fling off this melancholy thought of Retirement, and let us enjoy thee again in <HI>London</HI>: let me not lose my dearest Friend, for a Fit of the Spleen, or two.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear <HI>Ned,</HI> if any thing cou'd tempt me to that noisie Town, thou, and some choice Friends, whose Conversation I extreamly value, might do it: but I am weary of it, and dote upon my quiet Retirement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>

<P>Merry Meetings may be had; but not so frequently, as your Sessions: and when you think you have a choice Company, in rushes some loud obstrepe|rous Hunter, Hawker, or Jocky, good for nothing else, and Roars about Dogs, Kites, and Horses,; and spoils that Meeting. To keep open House, and enter|tain
<PB N="33" REF="21">
the neighbouring Coxcombs is worse than being Host of an Inn: and to meet Company elsewhere, is to be poyson'd with damn'd Wine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>I take care to meet none but good Company; and where-ever we meet, we take a course to have as good Wine from <HI>London,</HI> as any there: and at my own House, I will entertain none but good Company.</P>

<P>He that esteems himself by another mans opinion, is an Ass. My Te|nants I make much of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what can be the diversion of a Country Life? A man must be|wak'd at three in a Morning, by the crack'd Voices of Huntsmen, with damn'd Bugle Horns, and the confounded yelps of Curs: and for want of Friendship with Men, divert themselves with their Enmity to Beasts; and hunt as if the Devil were in 'em, till at dark night they are scarce able to dismount their Horses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are Fops, <HI>Ned,</HI> that make a business of Sport. I hunt with my Harriers half a dozen heats in a Morning, for Health and an Appetite: and, at Dinner time, let 'em be in never such full cry, I knock off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is some Reason in that; but your true Country Squire lives in Boots all the Winter, never talks or thinks of any thing but Sports, as he calls 'em: and if an ill Day comes, saunters about his House, lolls upon Couches; sighs and groans, as if he were a Prisoner in the Fleet; and the best thing he can find to do, is to Smoke, and Drink, and play at Back-gammon, with the Parson.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are of the strictest Order of Hunters, such as keep Journals of every Days hunting, and write long Letters of Foxchases from one end of <HI>England</HI> to the other. Tho these are Fops, <HI>Ned,</HI> a Reasonable man may enjoy himself very well in the Country.</P>
</SP>

</SP>

<P>All these things have we at <HI>London.</HI> The product of the best Corn|fields at <HI>Queen-Hithe</HI>; Hay, Straw, and Cattle, at <HI>Smithfield</HI>; with Horses too. Where is such a Garden in <HI>Europe,</HI> as the <HI>Stocks-Market?</HI> Where such a River as the <HI>Thames?</HI> Such Ponds and Decoys, as in <HI>Leaden-Hall-Market,</HI> for your Fish and Fowl? Such Game as at the Poulterers? And instead of Parks, every Cook's Shop for Venison, without Hunting, and venturing Neck or Arms for it. And for Cellars, from <HI>Temple-Bar</HI> to <HI>Aldgate</HI>; and all that I have use of, my own too, since I have Money.</P>

<P>Madam, the several Letters I have address'd to your Ladyship's hands, and my good Orator your Father, tho' you never saw me, have let you know who I am; and then you'll guess what I have to say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gert.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis true, my Lord, I do guess, and therefore your Lordship need not trouble your self to say it; for all Discourse, about that affair, runs to the same Tune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never lov'd before; nor can I believe that any Man loves like me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gert.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis all alike.
<Q>Madam, your Beauties! your excellent Accomplish|ments! your extraordinary Merits! Divine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The lustre of your Eyes! and the rest.</Q>
The honour to kiss your fair hands! <HI>&amp;c.</HI> All this we have in Romances, and Love and Honour Plays. Trust me, my Lord, 'tis tedious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cou'd I incline your gentle Heart to Love, then no Discourse of it wou'd seem so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gert.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't tell that; but as things stand now, indeed it makes me smile, to think of a grave Mother, or, for want of her, a wise Father, putting a Daughter into a Room, like a Hare out of a Basket, and letting him loose; that is, to act the Part of a Lover before Marriage, and never think of it after|ward. Then is she either to frown, be peevish, or sullen, and make no answers, or very scurvy ones; or else to blush, hold down her Head, tell the Sticks, and play with her Fan, and say, I have no thoughts of Marriage, I am too young, 'tis time enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Madam, a Lady of your VVit and Sence, knows 'tis the great end that VVoman is design'd for; and 'tis in vain for you to speak against Love; for every look, and every word of yours, inflames me more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gert.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's a word now, Inflames, and Chains, and Fetters! I warrant you; One wou'd think a man were a Martyr, or a Slave at <HI>Algiers</HI> at least. VVhat conversation might Men and VVomen have, did not this foolish Love interpose!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis impossible for a Man to forbear thinking, or talking of Love, in the presence of so Beautiful, so excellent a Lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gert.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cou'd expect no less&punc; Beautiful! Excellent! <HI>&amp;c.</HI> How sillily one looks, who must stand to hear her self Complemented! My Lord, you are a Man of Honour, and I will speak plainly to you: I am resolv'd against Love, therefore pray deal frankly with me: Disappoint the Old Gentleman, and let's
<PB N="36" REF="23">
not have one word of it betwixt us. My happiness or ruin depends upon your Breath. I am too young and giddy, to fix upon so solemn a business; and the pleasure I find in being free, cannot be bought at any rate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Father, Madam, I hope may be a prevailing Advocate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hope is a very thin Diet, fit for Love in a Feaver; but, to tell you true, I am apt to believe there is no such thing as love: but, if there be, I can assure you, you have gone the wrong way; for my Father is no Outwork of mine: you may take him, but you are ne'r the nearer me. I am a free Heiress of <HI>England,</HI> where Arbitrrry Power is at an end, and I am resolv'd to choose for my self. How happily am I reliev'd!

<P>Not all the ill Fortune I have ever met, can equal this; that he, whom I have lov'd so long, so true a Friend, so much a Man of Honour, shou'd be my Rival! I cannot blame him for it neither; he has broken no Trust: and any Man, that looks upon her, must be subdu'd, as I am. But my hope is yet, she is unapt to Love.

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mrs. <HI>Mountfort.</HI></STAGE>
<L><HI>I</HI> Was our <HI>Authors Advocate</HI> last year,</L>
<L>And then ye very gentle did appear.</L>
<L>To him ye now should more Indulgence show,</L>
<L>Eight months he has been sick, and well we know</L>
<L>How very little a sick man can do.</L>
<L>But could he Write with never so much <HI>Wit,</HI></L>
<L>He must despair of seeing a full <HI>Pit:</HI></L>
<L>Most of our constant Friends have left the Town,</L>
<L>Bravely to serve their <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Country</HI> gone.</L>
<L>Our unfrequented <HI>Theatre</HI> must mourn,</L>
<L>Till the <HI>Brave Youths Triumphantly</HI> return.</L>
<L><HI>Soft</HI> Men of <HI>Peace</HI> enough are left at home,</L>
<L>Daily to cram our House, if they'd but come:</L>
<L>They eagerly elsewhere in <HI>throngs</HI> resort,</L>
<L>Crowding for <HI>Places</HI> in the well fill'd <HI>Court.</HI></L>
<L>Here one who has been fifty years a <HI>Knave,</HI></L>
<L>Strives for a <HI>Place,</HI> with one foot in the Grave.</L>
<L>Another there, who did what e're he cou'd</L>
<L>Against the Soveraign Author of our good.</L>
<L>Some who rode Westward at least ten miles down,</L>
<L>Some made <HI>Blue Coats</HI> at him, and staid in Town.</L>
<L>All these would have preferment, as if they</L>
<L>Had to this Glorious Change prepar'd the way:</L>
<L>Thus there are more admirers to each place,</L>
<L>Than e're a Celebrated Beauty has.</L>
<L>And they who cannot that advancement gain,</L>
<L>They think their mighty <HI>Merits</HI> ought t' attain,</L>
<L>Steal to some <HI>Grumbling Club,</HI> and there complain.</L>
<L><PB REF="36">Pox on't, things go not well, I'll change my side,</L>
<L>I thought they would for my great Worth provide.</L>
<L>Pray have less <HI>Vanity,</HI> and learn more <HI>Wit,</HI></L>
<L>Come here, we've Places for you all most fit</L>
<L>Within our empty Boxes and our Pit.</L>
<L>But you who use to hiss, pray keep away,</L>
<L>And try to Write before you damn a Play;</L>
<L>'Twill then so hard a task to you appear,</L>
<L>You will not have the Heart to be severe.</L>
