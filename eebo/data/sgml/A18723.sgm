<HEAD>Churchyardes farewell.</HEAD>
<L>AS witte is neuer good</L>
<L>till it bee d&eacute;erely bought:</L>
<L>So fr&eacute;ends vntill their truth be tride,</L>
<L>may passe for thinges of nought.</L>
<L>For fr&eacute;endship all in woordes,</L>
<L>a kinde of flattringe is.</L>
<L>And if I thinke my woorthiest fr&eacute;ende</L>
<L>may be abusde by this,</L>
<L>I ought in plaine flat termes</L>
<L>to shewe him what I thinke,</L>
<L>And blaze the meaninge of my minde</L>
<L>by paper, pen, and Inke.</L>
<L>Because the doores be barde,</L>
<L>where my good will should pas:</L>
<L>And buzzinge B&eacute;es do cr&eacute;epe in place,</L>
<L>where Churcheyards credite was.</L>
<L>The fowlers mery pype</L>
<L>betraies the careles byrde:</L>
<L>And fl&eacute;eringe fawners lye in waite,</L>
<L>to g&eacute;eue their fr&eacute;ends a gyrde.</L>
<L>When fortune turnes hir face,</L>
<L>beware the Syrenes songe:</L>
<L>Beware the busie Clawbackes fine</L>
<L>whose freendship lastes not longe.</L>
<L>Thinke you the flyes doo flocke</L>
<L>aboute the fleashe in vaine?</L>
<L>Dooth not the B&eacute;e seeke out the flower</L>
<L>some hony there to gayne?</L>
<L>Doo courtiers all for loue,</L>
<L>approche the princes gates?</L>
<L>Dooth plainnesse in these double daies,</L>
<L>repaire to great estates?</L>
<L>No sure in maskinge robes</L>
<L>goeth mischiefe muffled nowe:</L>
<L>And subtile sleightes with snakish stings,</L>
<L>doo lodge in smilinge browe.</L>
<L>And your affections blinde,</L>
<L>hath you bewitched so,</L>
<L>Ye haue no power to finde your freendes,</L>
<L>nor to descerne your fo.</L>
<L>Ye fill the fleesinge fistes,</L>
<L>and let the needie lacke:</L>
<L>And sharpe their teeth whose crafty tungs</L>
<L>can byte behinde your backe.</L>
<L>I pray you tell me now,</L>
<L>if hap woulde let you slyde,</L>
<L>How many would through thick &amp; thinne</L>
<L>for loue with you abide?</L>
<L>Perhaps a heape of suche</L>
<L>could hungry hangers on,</L>
<L>Whose nature geues the courte a fygge</L>
<L>when worldly hap is gon.</L>
<L>Can you not see the cause,</L>
<L>that bringes them swarminge in?</L>
<L>And where the wh&eacute;ele of Fortune swayes,</L>
<L>the worlde fauour winne?</L>
<L>Had not your elders wise,</L>
<L>good triall of suche trashe?</L>
<L>Did you not s&eacute;e what woorthy wittes</L>
<L>at length were lefte in lashe:</L>
<L>By trustinge some to farre,</L>
<L>and heapinge hope in those</L>
<L>That seemed fr&eacute;ends to outwarde sight,</L>
<L>and yet were secrete foes?</L>
<L>O let me licence haue</L>
<L>to painte these pecocks out,</L>
<L>Whose fethers wauereth with the winde</L>
<L>and so turnes taile aboute:</L>
<L>Yet flicker with their winges,</L>
<L>to faune the face awhile,</L>
<L>Untill their sodaine flight they take,</L>
<L>and so their fr&eacute;ends beguile.</L>
<L>What should we iudge of them,</L>
<L>that stare in faces still:</L>
<L>Where lo, for all their curtsie great,</L>
<L>they beare but small good will.</L>
<L>And where they seldome come,</L>
<L>but when some sute they haue:</L>
<L>They make a signe to s&eacute;e my Lorde,</L>
<L>yet seeke by sleight to craue.</L>
<L>What makes them watch their howres,</L>
<L>and thrust in thickest preest.</L>
<L>It is for fr&eacute;endship that they beare</L>
<L>vnto a certaine lease.</L>
<L>My Lorde must helpe to get,</L>
<L>now crowche and kn&eacute;ele they all:</L>
<L>Now stand they vp like sainctes in shrine,</L>
<L>or nayld against a wall?</L>
<L>Now figge they here and there,</L>
<L>as thornes were in their h&eacute;eles</L>
<L>Now trudge aboute these whirlegigges,</L>
<L>as worlde did runne on wh&eacute;eles.</L>
<L>Now cast they fr&eacute;endly lookes,</L>
<L>all ouer the chambers gaye.</L>
<L>Now geue they place as God were there,</L>
<L>now turne they euery waye.</L>
<L>Now talke they trimme in printe,</L>
<L>and prate of Robin hood:</L>
<L>Much like the knightes of Arthers courte,</L>
<L>that knew full well their good.</L>
<L>Some through a finer meane,</L>
<L>doo cr&eacute;epe in credites lappe:</L>
<L>And vale their bonettes by deuise,</L>
<L>as fauour folowed cappe.</L>
<L>Suche Iuglers bleare your eies,</L>
<L>and smile within their sl&eacute;eue:</L>
<L>When honour in his harmles moode</L>
<L>Dooth best of them bel&eacute;eue.</L>
<L>Were you but once a daye,</L>
<L>in simple seruauntes place,</L>
<L>And like a looker on ye stoode,</L>
<L>to prie vpon this case:</L>
<L>Then should ye throughly s&eacute;e,</L>
<L>who plaies the wily foxe:</L>
<L>And how the Wolfe can frame himselfe,</L>
<L>to draw in yoke like oxe.</L>
<L>Then shoulde the mufled men,</L>
<L>shew foorth their faces bare</L>
<L>And therby noble hartes shoulde learne</L>
<L>to knowe what flatterers are.</L>
<L>The glory of your state,</L>
<L>heaues vp your hed so hie:</L>
<L>That many thinges doo scape your vewe,</L>
<L>whiche we s&eacute;e full with eye.</L>
<L>And who is now so bolde,</L>
<L>that dare flat warninge geue,</L>
<L>To suche as in toppe of pompe,</L>
<L>or princely plasures lyue.</L>
<L>I muse what new founde chaunce,</L>
<L>hath so disguisde the state</L>
<L>That men oft times for speakyng plaine,</L>
<L>doo purchace endlesse hate.</L>
<L>Whilest fraude and fained ch&eacute;ere</L>
<L>dooth euell honour f&eacute;ede:</L>
<L>And noman dare a plaister geue,</L>
<L>to heale the wounde in d&eacute;ede:</L>
<L>Full fickle shall you walke,</L>
<L>and neuer wante disease.</L>
<L>They should be banisht from your courte</L>
<L>that are so glad to please</L>
<L>With twittell twatlyng tales.</L>
<L>The truth like larm bell.</L>
<L>Should shortly sounde in tender eares</L>
<L>and learne you to doo well.</L>
<L>But sure the sw&eacute;etest nuttes</L>
<L>doo noorishe woormes apace,</L>
<L>And flatterers of the finest stampe,</L>
<L>in courte haue finest place.</L>
<L>I am to plaine therefore,</L>
<L>my penne hath drunke to muche?</L>
<L>An alie hed makes idle hande,</L>
<L>the quicke to n&eacute;ere to touche.</L>
<L>Nay, nay, some one must speake,</L>
<L>although the vice it b&eacute;e:</L>
<L>Or els the play were done ye wot,</L>
<L>then Lordinges pardon m&eacute;e.</L>
<L>For fr&eacute;e of euery Hance</L>
<L>I thanke the gods I am,</L>
<L>And serues no turne but for a vice,</L>
<L>since first to courte I came.</L>
<L>To make the Ladies laugh,</L>
<L>that leades the retchles liues</L>
<L>Who late, or neuer woodcocke like</L>
<L>at later Lammas thriues.</L>
<L>Yet if the foole had gotte,</L>
<L>at his departinge thence</L>
<L>A night cap, or a motley coate,</L>
<L>or els some spendinge pence.</L>
<L>It had bene well enough:</L>
<L>but nothinge there I founde</L>
<L>For nothinge from their budgets fell</L>
<L>they were so straitly bounde.</L>
<L>Ye lie sir Daw in d&eacute;ede,</L>
<L>canst thou so longe be there</L>
<L>But needes must fall into thy handes,</L>
<L>some paringe of the peare?</L>
<L>A hungry paringe Lorde</L>
<L>he hath that there doth weight:</L>
<L>He watcheth like a gr&eacute;edy hounde</L>
<L>that standeth at receight:</L>
<L>That oft for lacke of g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">me,</L>
<L>runnes home his panche to fill</L>
<L>Or sterues in forest or in parke,</L>
<L>at least at kepers will.</L>
<L>Looke what to courte he brought</L>
<L>it is consumed and gone</L>
<L>And there the fleash of euery iointe,</L>
<L>is worne vnto the bone.</L>
<L>The carraine crowes of Cheape</L>
<L>in steyng bones so bare</L>
<L>Would clap the fell in counter too,</L>
<L>to breede him further care.</L>
<L>Nay fie on such good hap,</L>
<L>on Souldiers faith I sweare:</L>
<L>To sell the Courts and Cittie bothe,</L>
<L>and he that takes me there.</L>
<L>Let him cut of mine cares,</L>
<L>and slitte my nose aright</L>
<L>And make a curtoll of the beast,</L>
<L>that hath a hed so light.</L>
<L>To linger out my yeeres</L>
<L>for moone shine in the well</L>
<L>A hood, a hood, for such a foole,</L>
<L>a bable and a bell.</L>
<L>A coxcombe is to good</L>
<L>for such a calfe I trow.</L>
<L>As of my Lorde my leaue I take,</L>
<L>so now againe I go.</L>
<L>Where fortune shall assigne,</L>
<L>my staffe to light or fall.</L>
<L>And thus I know a truer freende,</L>
<L>was not amonge them all.</L>
<L>Then to my power I was,</L>
<L>to you and all your race</L>
<L>Nor vnto whome I dayly wishe,</L>
<L>more blesse happe and grace.</L>
