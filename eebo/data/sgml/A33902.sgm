<HEAD>A
DEFENCE
OF THE
Absolution given to Sir William Perkins
at the Place of Execution. April the 3d.</HEAD>
<P>MY being present and in some measure Officiating
at the Place of <HI>Execution</HI> on <HI>Friday</HI> last, has been
extreamly misunderstood. The <HI>Weekly Intelli|gence</HI>
together with the <HI>Remarker,</HI> have censured this Acti|on
with a great deal of Liberty, and Heat. I thank
God I am not easily disturbed with intemperate Language,
especially when us given without Occasion. So that it
Matters had gone no farther, I could have passed over
the ill Usage and said nothing. I confess having received
notice that some Persons of Figure threatned me with
Imprisonment, I took a little care of my self; and as it
happen'd not without reason. For on <HI>Monday</HI> about
Twelve at Night, six or eight Persons rushed into my
Lodgings, broke open a Trunck, and seiz'd some <HI>Papers</HI>
of Value, tho' perfectly Inoffensive, and Foreign to their
Purpose. And since, I understand there is a <HI>Bill</HI> found
against me for <HI>High Misdemeanors.</HI> And now one would
think I had done something very extraordinary.</P>
<P>I shall therefore make a brief Report of Matters of
Fact, and leave the World to judge, whether all these
Censures and Severities are deserved or not.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>William Perkins</HI> (whom I had not seen for four or
five Years last past) after his Tryal, desired me to come to
him in order to his Preparation for another World. I ac|cordingly
visited him in <HI>Newgate,</HI> as I thought my self
obliged by my Character. I was put in the List of those
who had leave to see him by Publick Order, and had the
<PB N="2" REF="3">
first two Days the Liberty of conversing with him in
Private. Afterwards I was not permitted to Speak, or
Pray with him alone, a <HI>Keeper,</HI> being always present. At
last even this Permission was recall'd, insomuch that I
could never see him from <HI>Wednesday</HI> Morning, <HI>April</HI> the
1<HI>st.</HI> till <HI>Friday</HI> at the place of <HI>Execution.</HI> Sir <HI>William</HI> being
under an Expectation of Death from the time of his <HI>Sen|tence,</HI>
had given me the State of his Conscience, and
therefore desired the Solemn Absolution of the Church,
might be Pronounced to him by me, the last Day. And
understanding I was refused Admittance on <HI>Friday</HI> Morn|ing,
he sent me word that he would gladly see me at
the Place of <HI>Execution,</HI> I went thither, and gave him the
Absolution he requested, it being impracticable for me to
do it elsewhere. This Office I perform'd Word for Word
in Form, as it stands in the <HI>Visitation of the Sick.</HI> And
now where lies the great Crime of all this? When a Man
has declared his Sorrow for all the Faults, and Miscar|riages
of his Life, and qualified himself for the Priviledge
of Absolution, with what Justice could it be denied him?
Ought not Dying Persons to be Supported in their last
Agonies, and pass into the other World with all the Ad|vantage
the Church can give them? I am surprized, so re|gular
a Proceeding as this, should give so much Offence,
and make so much a Noise as I perceive it has done, Some
People I understand are displeas'd at the Office being per|form'd
with <HI>imposition</HI> of <HI>Hands.</HI> Now this is not only an
innocent, but an ancient Ceremony of Absolution. ' Twas
the general Practise of the Primitive Church in such cases,
long before there were any Exceptions to the <HI>Roman Com|munion.</HI>
'Tis in the Opinion of several Fathers, and good
Modern Expositors refer'd to by the Apostle (1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5. 22.)
'Tis likewise prescribed the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ssisting Presbyters</HI> in our
own <HI>Ordination Form.</HI> But I suppose I need say no more in
defence of this <HI>Circumstance.</HI> To proceed. Others seem
very much shocked at the Thing it self; and think it a
strange Presumption to admit a Person charged with so
high a Crime, to the benefit of Absolution. With submissi|on,
<PB N="3" REF="3">
on, this is concluding a great deal too fast. Are all people
damned that are cast in a Capital Indictment? If so, to
what purpose are they visited by Divine, why are they
exhorted to Repentance, and have Time allowed them to
fit them for death? But if they may be acquitted
hereafter, notwithstanding their Condemnation here;
if they may be recovered by Recollection, by
Repentance, and Resignation, why should the
Church refuse them her Pardon on <HI>Earth,</HI> when she be|lieves
tis passed in <HI>Heaven?</HI> The Power of the <HI>Keys</HI> was
given for this purpose, that the <HI>Ministers</HI> of God might
<HI>bind</HI> or <HI>loose,</HI> as the Disposition of the Person required. The
latter I sincerely believed to be Sir <HI>William</HI>'s Case: I judg|ed
him to have a full <HI>Right</HI> to all the Priviledges of <HI>Com|munion:</HI>
And therefore had I denied him Absolution upon
his Request, I had failed in my Duty, and gone against
the Authority both of the <HI>Ancient,</HI> and <HI>English</HI> Church,
If 'tis said that the Nature of this Gentleman's Charge
required his be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ng Absolved in Private. To this I answer,
so he had been, had I been permitted to visit him the last
Morning. But this Liberty was refused me more than
once. And I hope I shall not be blamed for Impossibilities
of other Mens making. In short, he seem'd very desirous
of Absolution at my Hands, as being the only Person ac|quainted
with his Condition. Privately 'twas not in my
Power to give it him; So that he must either receive it
Publickly from me, or not at all. But Sir <HI>William</HI> con|fess'd
himself acquainted with the intended <HI>Assassination.</HI>
Pray did he confess it to me, and have I revealed any
Part of his Confession? Then I had been guilty of <HI>High
Misdemeanor</HI> indeed. I had broke the 113<HI>th.</HI> Canon, and
been Pronounced <HI>Irregular</HI> by the Church. And he that
falls under <HI>Irregularity,</HI> is for ever after incapable of Exe|cuting
the Office of a Priest. (Dr. <HI>Heylin</HI>'s Introduct. to
<HI>Cyprian, Angl. p. 6.)</HI> I confess there is an Exception in the
Canon, but that does not reach the Case in Hand, even
upon the largest Supposition. Well! But Sir <HI>William</HI> own'd
this Charge before the <HI>Committee.</HI> How could I know
<PB N="4" REF="4">
that? I neither saw, Sir <HI>William</HI> after his Examination,
till <HI>Friday</HI> Noon, nor the <HI>Votes</HI> which mentioned it till af|ter
that Time. But he confess'd it in his <HI>Paper.</HI> What then?
Which way does the <HI>Paper</HI> concern me? 'Tis well known
Sir <HI>William Perkins</HI> was a Man of Sense, and bred to <HI>Law</HI>
and <HI>Letters,</HI> and needed no help to assist him in Writing
a few Lines, Besides, I was not permitted to come near
him for more than two Days before he suffer'd: Neither
was he allow'd so much as Pen and Ink till the last Morn|ing.
Then it was that he penn'd his <HI>Speech,</HI> as <HI>I</HI> am told by
those who were present; and having read it before the
<HI>Keeper,</HI> deliver'd a Copy of it to a Friend, which was
not shew'd to me till after the <HI>Execution.</HI> Indeed, <HI>I</HI> did
believe he would leave some <HI>Paper</HI> behind him, both be|cause
'tis customary upon such sad Occasions; and because
on <HI>Tuesday</HI> Night when he expected Death on <HI>Wednes|day,</HI>
he desired Pen, Ink and Paper, for that purpose.</P>
<P>And now after all, <HI>I</HI> desire to know, in what single Cir|cumltance
<HI>I</HI> have misbehaved my self, or done any thing
unbecoming my Profession? 'Tis very hard a Man must
be Persecuted for Performing the Obligations of his Office,
and the Duties of common Friendship, and Humanity. As
for any Methods of <HI>Murder, I</HI> dislike them no less than
those who rail loudest; and nothing but a Mercenary
Malice could suggest the contrary. But if the Functions
of the Priesthood, and the Assistances of Religion, and
the Reading the Publick <HI>Liturgy</HI> are grown a Crime, <HI>I</HI>
am not concerned at the Imputation. <HI>I</HI> hope the <HI>complying</HI>
Clergy will take some care to check the Disorders, and
inform the ignorance of their People a little better. If
they are unreproved for these slanderous Excesses, their
Pastors must one Day expect to account for it.</P>
<P>As for those in <HI>Power,</HI> 'tis possible they may have been
govern'd by Mis-reports, and suddain Resentment: if
so, second Thoughts, and the Reason of the Case, will put
a stop to their Severities. And that this may be the
issue of the Business, I think my self obliged to with as
well for their sakes, as my own.</P>

<HEAD>A FARTHER
DEFENCE
OF THE
ABSOLUTION
GIVEN TO
Sr. WILLIAM PERKINS,
OCCASIONED
By a Paper, Entituled a Declaration of
the Archbishops, and Bishops, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT a Fortnight since I publish'd the forego|ing
Defence of the <HI>Absolution</HI> given to Sir <HI>William
Perkins.</HI> 'Tis true, the Vindication was not drawn
out into any great length, neither did I imagine it neces|sary.
That which was said, was in my opinion suffici|ent
to satisfie any candid and impartial Reader. If the
Argument was any where over-contracted, 'twas in that
part which mentions <HI>Imposition</HI> of <HI>Hands.</HI> Here I confess
the proofs were but generally named, and the force and
improvement of them left in some measure to Collection,
My desire to undeceive the people; and to silence their
clamours as soon as might be the disadvantage of my re|tirement,
and the plainness of the Case, were the reasons
why I was no fuller upon that Head. But now I have a
fresh opportunity to treat the point more at large. The
late <HI>Declaration,</HI> &amp;c. of the Bishops having given me a
just occesion to resume the Argument. I must own
the perusal of this <HI>Declaration</HI> surprized me very much.
I could not imagine these <HI>Reverend Prelates</HI> would have
published so unsupported a Censure; nor engaged their
<PB N="6" REF="5">
<HI>Character</HI> so far in this Affair. I am almost amazed an
innocent Conduct should be thus misconstrued, and the
Charge run so high without proof, or provocation to de|fended
it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Declaration</HI> begins with some. Remarks upon the
<HI>Papers</HI> of Sir <HI>William Perkins,</HI> and Sir <HI>Iohn Friend:</HI> These
Exceptions I shall pass over, as being unconcerned in
their Defence. Indeed my Resolution upon the whole is,
to engage no farther than the Justification of my own
Conduct; as being unwilling to have any unnecessary
Disputes with these Reverend Prelates.</P>
<P>The pretended irregularity objected against Mr. <HI>Snatt,</HI>
Mr. <HI>Cook,</HI> and my self, relates wholly to the <HI>Absolution</HI> gi|ven
to those two Gentlemen at the place of <HI>Execution.</HI>
The performance of this Office, the Bishops are pleased to
say was <HI>extreamly insolent and without precedent, in the
manner, and altogether irregular in the thing.</HI> (p. 6, 7.)</P>
<P>I shall endeavour to justifie my Practise against every
Point of the Accusation, and prove the <HI>Absolution</HI> defensi|ble,
both with respect to manner, and form, to persons,
and occasion. And 1<HI>st.</HI> with respect to the Manner. And
here I shall make good three Things.</P>
<P>1<HI>st.</HI> That giving Absolution with Imposition of Hands
was the general practise of the Ancient Church.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly.</HI> That the performance of this Ceremony was al|lowed
to Priests, and sometimes to Deacons, as well as Bi|shops.</P>
<P>3<HI>dly.</HI> That Imposition of Hands is enjoyed the <HI>assisting
Presbyters</HI> by our own Church, in the Office of <HI>Ordination,</HI>
and by parity of reason is fairly applicable to the present
case.</P>
<P>1<HI>st.</HI> That giving of Absolution with Imposition of Hands,
was the general practise of the Antient Church.</P>
<P>To begin with <HI>Tertullian;</HI> who lived in the beginning
of the third Century. This Father understands that place
of the Apostle, <HI>lay hands suddainly on no man,
(I Tim,</HI> 5. 22.) of the Offices of Pennance and Ab|solution,
(<HI>L. de pudic. cap.</HI> 18.) And (<HI>cap.</HI> 22.) He alludes
<PB N="7" REF="5">
to the same Custom in these words, <HI>Carnem laniatam pro|sternens,</HI>
as <HI>Albaspinaeus</HI> observes. <HI>(Albasp. obser. l. 2. p. 97.
Not. in Tertull. p. 181.)</HI> Indeed the Design of his Book <HI>de
Pudicitia,</HI> plainly determines the Author to this sense. Here
he treats professedly of those who were to be finally excluded
from Church Communion, and denyed the Discipline of
Pennance. He disputes nothing about <HI>Confirmation,</HI> or <HI>Or|ders,</HI>
so that 'tis evident the <HI>Imposition</HI> of <HI>Hands,</HI> mentioned
by him, must relate to Penitential Absolution.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Cyprian's</HI> Council of <HI>Carthage,</HI> is express to the same
purpose. Here <HI>Nemesianus, Crescens, Secundinus,</HI> and <HI>Vin|centius,</HI>
Bishops of <HI>Thubuni, Cirta, Carpi,</HI> and <HI>Tiberis,</HI> all of
them agree, that the Churches Peace, and the Expedients
of Reconciliation, were to pass through this Form of Impo|sition
of Hands.</P>
<P>The 80th Canon of the 4th Council of <HI>Carthage,</HI> enjoyns,
That during the whole time of Abstinence, (I suppose either
stated, or occasional) the Priests (<HI>Sacerdotes</HI>) should lay
their Hands upon the <HI>Penitents.</HI></P>
<P>The 11th Canon of the 3d Council of <HI>Toledo,</HI> in the Di|rections
for the Methods of Pennance, is positive for the fre|quent
use of this Ceremony, which made <HI>Albaspinaeus</HI> con|clude,
That <HI>Absolution-Prayers,</HI> and <HI>Imposition of Hands,</HI>
were repeated and customary in such cases. (<HI>Albasp. Observ.
l. 2. p. 86.)</HI></P>
<P>To conclude this point. The Learned Dr. <HI>Hammond</HI> in
his Annotations on the Text above mentioned, (1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5. 22.)
refers the laying on of Hands to <HI>Absolution.</HI> <Q>The Apostle
(says he) exhorts <HI>Timothy</HI> that he should not make too
much haste to receive those who were under Censures, to
Absolution. For that was the thing which would most
probably make him partaker, or guilty of their sins, which
the Censures were designed to reform in them, but would
not do so, if before they had approved their Repentance
and Reformation, they were received to the Peace of the
Church.</Q> This Learned Divine cites a great many Autho|rities
in Defence of his Opinion, which the <HI>Reader</HI> may con|sult
at his leisure.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="6">Secondly, The pronouncing the Absolution with Imposi|tion
of Hands, is no Encroachment upon the Episcopal Au|thority,
but plainly allow'd to the Order of <HI>Presbyters.</HI></P>
<P>This point I shall make good from several plain Testimo|nies
of St. <HI>Cyprian,</HI> whose Authority must be granted to be
unexceptionable, both with respect to the Antiquity and
Character of the Person. Indeed 'tis to this Father that we
are principally obliged for the Remains we have of the Di|scipline
and Government of the Primitive Church.</P>
<P>Now St. <HI>Cyprian</HI> is categorical in the case, and affirms
roundly, that in <HI>lesser Crimes than those of the Lapsed, the
Penitent could not be admitted to full Communion, unless
the Bishops and Clergy had laid their Hands upon him. Nisi
prius illi ab Episcopis &amp; clero manus fuerit imposita.</HI> (Ep. 17.
p. 39. Ed. Oxon.) Now where the Bishops and Clergy are
thus contradistinguish'd, the Order of Priests must be com|prehended
in the latter, in the most restrain'd Construction.
I might produce his 15th and 16th <HI>Ep. (p. 34, 37.)</HI> for the
same purpose; but because these Testimonies run much in
the words of the former, I shall wave the Recital.</P>
<P>This Father in his 18th Ep. tells his Priests and Deacons,
That <HI>they need not expect his coming Home, to reconcile the
Lapsed, but if any of the Laiety were in danger of Death, a
Priest, and if a Priest could not be had, and the necessity was
extream, a Deacon, was a sufficient Authority, to hear their
Confession, to lay Hands upon them, and consign them to the
Peace of the Church.</HI> The same Advice, upon the same oc|casion
is repeated, <HI>(Ep. 19. p. 41.)</HI> From whence 'tis evi|dent,
that <HI>Imposition of Hands</HI> was no reserv'd incommuni|cable
priviledge of the Bishops, but delegated as low as the
Deacons, upon emergent necessity, and visible Approaches
of Death. These Authorities of St. <HI>Cyprian,</HI> are all double
charged, and prove two points at once. They prove, that
Imposition of Hands was a general Appendix to Absolution,
and that it was within the Commission of the Priest to offici|ate
in the Ceremony. To proceed.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="6">In the 13th Canon of the first Council of <HI>Nice,</HI> the <HI>Viati|cum</HI>
is order'd to be given to those who are at the point of
Death. And by the <HI>Viaticum, Albaspinaeus</HI> proves, that Ab|solution
with Imposition of Hands was meant, and not the
<HI>Eucharist:</HI> And that such an Absolution might be given by
those who were no more than Priests. <HI>(Albasp.</HI> Not. <HI>in quos|dam
Can. p. 131.)</HI> I could amasse a great many more Testi|monies
were it necessary; but I conceive what has been said
already, may be sufficient to vindicate my Practise from the
Charge of Encroachment, and Singularity.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Imposition of Hands is enjoyn'd the <HI>Assisting
Presbyters</HI> by our own Church in the Office of <HI>Ordination,</HI>
and by parity of reason is fairly applicable to the present case.</P>
<P>If our Church had thought the Imposition of Hands
too much for the Character of Priests, she would not
have prescrib'd them a share in't at her <HI>Ordinations.</HI>
But since she has allow'd them this liberty in the most so|lemn
Exercises of Authority, why should she deny it in infe|riour
Cases? To assist in the Conveyance of an Authority,
seems a greater mark of Power, than the executing any
Branch of the Authority conveyed. If the Presbyters are
permitted to lay their Hands upon the <HI>Clergy,</HI> why not <HI>&agrave; for|tiori</HI>
upon the <HI>Laity?</HI> St. <HI>Hierom</HI> affirms plainly <HI>(Ep. ad
Evagr.)</HI> that the <HI>Powers</HI> of a Priest comprehend those of a
Bishop, excepting in the point of <HI>Ordination.</HI> Our Church
has never condemn'd this Father's Assertion; why then may
not the first <HI>Absolve</HI> with Imposition of Hands, no less than
the other?</P>
<P>But there is no Appointment of this Ceremony in the <HI>Ab|solution-Rubrick.</HI>
True: Neither is there any Prohibition.
The <HI>Rubrick</HI> is perfectly silent both as to Posture and Ge|sture,
and yet some Circumstances of this Nature must of
necessity be used.</P>
<P>Now since our Church allows the Priest Imposition of
Hands in another case, and does not forbid it in this, Is it a|ny
harm if our Liberty moves upward, and determines it
self by general Usage and Primitive Practice? Our Church
<PB N="10" REF="7">
has always professed a regard for the Patterns of Antiquity:
We can't do her a greater Honour, than by conforming to
the Solemnities of the purest Ages, than by making the Di|scipline
of <HI>Fathers</HI> and <HI>Councils</HI> the Rule of our Behaviour.
Especially when we are not bound up by National Law, and
particular <HI>Constitution.</HI> Thus much for the <HI>Manner.</HI></P>
<P>I come now to justifie the thing and the occasion.</P>
<P>'Tis objected by these <HI>Reverend Prelates,</HI> that the three
<HI>assisting Clergymen pronounced a Form of Absolution,</HI> &amp;c. With
submission, I hope <HI>a Form</HI> is better than <HI>no Form.</HI> Especially
when it was a Form <HI>Rubrically</HI> appointed. A Form drawn
up by the publick Authority of the Church, confirm'd by
<HI>Canon,</HI> and Act of <HI>Parliament.</HI> A Form the most pertinent
and proper to the occasion of any in the <HI>Liturgy.</HI> I am sorry
to see the solemn Offices of Religion mentioned with such
seeming coldness, and Abatements of Expression. Were it
not that I am unwilling to give these <HI>Reverend Prelates</HI> the
trouble of a Question, I would gladly understand what Form
they could have fix'd on more suitable to so sad an occasion?
I'm sure that <HI>Form</HI> of Absolution is the most solemn and Au|thoritative
of any in the <HI>Service-Book.</HI> Now if ever the
Church exerts her self ought it not to be in cases of the great|est
Necessity? Can her most comfortable Administrations
and the highest Acts of her Authority, be better employ'd
than for the Relief of Dying Persons, who are combating the
<HI>King of Terrours,</HI> and stand just upon the brink of Eternity?
Upon the whole, I am surprized they should say the <HI>Ru|brick
gave us no pretence of Authority to absolve those Persons.</HI>
Does not the <HI>Rubrick</HI> give the Priest a power to pronounce
the <HI>Absolution,</HI> and to judge of the Condition of the Peni|nent?
This cannot be deny'd. And why then had we no
pretence of Authority? <HI>Because the Rubrick relates to the Sick.</HI>
To this I answer. Had the Church left us a stated <HI>Office</HI> for
<HI>Persons Condemn'd,</HI> and we had refused to make use of it,
there had been some force in the Objection: But as the mat|ter
stands, I humbly conceive there is none at all. The Church
without question, would have <HI>Condemned Persons</HI> taken care
<PB N="11" REF="7">
of, as well as others, and their Spiritual Necessities supplied.
And if so, is it not more respect to the Church to officiate in
Forms of her own setting forth, than in private and unau|thorized
Compositions? And if the Function was to be per|formed
in the publick Devotions, I desire to know wh&agrave;t part
of them could have been more proper than the <HI>Office</HI> of <HI>Visi|tation
of the Sick?</HI> If we consider the Design of the Church,
and especially the Rubrick before the <HI>Absolution,</HI> we shall
find that she intended this Office to prepare People for the o|ther
World, and consider'd them rather as Dying, than
likely to recover. This appears evidently from the Questions
and Advices order'd to be ask'd and given; so that where|ever
Death is in view, the <HI>Office</HI> cannot be unseasonable, nor
misapplyed. And can any Persons be more certain of Death
than those who are publickly Condemn'd, who lie under fa|tal
<HI>Sentence,</HI> and irresistible Power? Who have the Force of
the County to dispatch them, and are just ready to receive
the Stroke? As to the previous Questions, they were put and
answer'd, the <HI>Absolution</HI> was desired, and the <HI>Confession</HI> re|ceiv'd
in Prison; and in short, the Churches Directions were
observed in every particular. But we <HI>did not move them to
make a special Confession of their Sins at that time.</HI> With Sub|mission,
where lies the Necessity, or even the Expediency of
such a Practise? Does our Church oblige Dying Persons to
publick Confession? Does she require them to throw open
the Retirements of Conscience, and the Secrets of private
Life, to the view of the World? I am at a loss to understand
why we should be charg'd with Omissions on such accounts
as these.</P>
<P>The <HI>Declaration,</HI> &amp;c. proceeds with great vehemence, (<HI>p.</HI> 9.)
and charges us with <HI>manifest Transgression of the Churches
Order, and prophane Abuse of the Authority of Christ.</HI> These
are hard words, but I hope altogether undeserved. 'Tis
true, they instance only in Mr. <HI>Snatt,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Cook,</HI> but I
must own the Objection lies equally against my self; for I
never saw Sir <HI>Iohn Friend</HI> during his whole Imprisonment.
But in assisting at his Absolution so far as laying on my Hand
<PB N="12" REF="8">
amounts to, I did no more than what is easily defensible. I
grant I had no immediate and particular knowledge of his
Condition, neither was it necessary. Our Church, in con|formity
to Antiquity, has made the Priest the proper Judge
of the Qualifications of the <HI>Penitent,</HI> and supposes him fit to
be trusted, and believed in that Affair. Now Mr. <HI>Snatt</HI> and
Mr. <HI>Cook,</HI> (upon whose Judgment and Integrity I can ve|ry
well depend) had given me a general Account of Sir <HI>Iohn</HI>'s
Pious Disposition, and that he was well prepared for all the
assistance the Church could give him. The having so good
Information from first hands, from proper and authorized
Judges, is sufficient to warrant my part in Sir <HI>Iohn</HI>'s <HI>Absolu|tion.</HI>
This, besides what has been said, I shall make good
from two parallel Instances.</P>
<P>First, 'Tis well known that Bishops of the antient Church
used to give a sort of <HI>Certificates</HI> to those that Travell'd; by
vertue of which, they were not only entertained and accom|modated,
but admitted to full Communion all over <HI>Christen|dom.
(Albasp. Not. in Can.</HI> p. 115.) From whence we may ob|serve,
that personal Acquaintance, and particular Examina|tion,
are not necessary to give a Right to the Priviledges of
Christianity. Where the Credentials are good, the Church
is to enquire no farther; she is to presume upon the probity
of the person recommended, and to treat him accordingly.</P>
<P>Secondly, Our own Church in some of the highest Admi|nistrations
acts upon Principles of Trust and Confidence.
She conveys her Priviledges, and exercises her Authority,
without always insisting on personal Enquiry and immediate
proof. At the giving of <HI>Holy Orders</HI> neither the Bishops, nor
the assisting Presbyters, are always personally acquainted
with those they <HI>Ordain.</HI> The prudence of our Church does
not tie us up to such unreasonable Rigours. Both Practise,
and the <HI>Ordination Form,</HI> suppose the contrary. And why
then may not the Priest assist in <HI>Absolution</HI> as well as <HI>Orders,</HI>
without any previous Experiment of the State of the Person?
Why may not the first, as well as the latter branch of his
Authority, act upon the Warrant of unexceptionable Testi|mony?
<PB N="13" REF="8">
By all parity of Reason and force of Consequence, the
practise is no less defensible in one case, than in the other.</P>
<P>If 'tis objected, That the joyning of all the three Clergy|men
in the Imposition of Hands is unpresidented, and ex|ceptionable.
To this I answer. That if the Action was
lawful, singly perform'd, I can't imagine how a concurrence
of more authorized Persons should make it otherwise? Is
there any harm in Union and Solemnity? Or can Religion be
treated with too many Circumstances of Advantage? What
<HI>Canon</HI> is there that stints the Assistance to <HI>One,</HI> and forbids
a plurality of Persons? <HI>Timothy</HI> had the <HI>Hands of the Pres|bytery
laid upon him,</HI> (1 Tim. 4. 14.) which, without doubt,
exceeded the Number now objected. Our Church, at her
<HI>Ordination,</HI> allows this <HI>Ceremony</HI> to all the Presbyters present.
And in the very case of <HI>Absolution,</HI> the <HI>Penitent</HI> was to re|ceive
<HI>Imposition of Hands</HI> from the Bishop and Clergy; as
appears from the Testimonies of St. <HI>Cyprian</HI> above mentio|ned.
Farther.</P>
<P>These <HI>Reverend Prelates</HI> argue that <HI>we must either look on
the Persons absolved as Impenitents, or Martyrs;</HI> and they
make their advantage of each branch of the Supposition.
(<HI>p.</HI> 10, 11.) But, with submission, I see no necessity of grant|ing
the Disjunction. For there may be a third way of con|sidering
the matter. To speak to my own case: I absolv'd
Sir <HI>William Perkins</HI> as a <HI>Penitent;</HI> and I suppose every Body
must be absolved under that Consideration. For Absolution
supposes both Sin, and Repentance, in the Notion of it. But
as for the <HI>Matter</HI> of Sir <HI>William</HI>'s Repentance, that is never
likely to be known from me. Neither am I in the least affect|ed
with the Bishop's Inference. For supposing I receiv'd a
defective <HI>Confession,</HI> am I accountable for that? However, I
neither do nor am obliged to declare my Opinion in this mat|ter.
But thus far I am positive, that there was nothing con|fes'd
to me, which the <HI>Canon</HI> obliges me to reveal: And what
the Canon does not enjoyn me to discover, it enioyns me not
to discover. (<HI>Can. 113. Vid. first Defence</HI>) And so there is an
end of this Dispute.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="9">I hope by this time it may appear, that I am neither un|furnish'd
with <HI>Reason,</HI> or <HI>Precedent,</HI> to justifie what I have
done. However I shall give one late instance for the whole
case, and so conclude.</P>
<P>At the <HI>Execution</HI> of Mr. <HI>Ashton, Ian.</HI> 1690. Absolution
was given him in the same Form, with Imposition of Hands,
at the same place, and upon the same occasion; and a justify|ing
<HI>Paper</HI> left by the Person that Suffer'd. Now at that time
there was no Exceptions made either to <HI>Manner,</HI> or <HI>Thing.</HI>
The performance was so far from displeasing, that the <HI>Sheriff</HI>
gave his Thanks for the <HI>Solemnity</HI> of the <HI>Office.</HI> There was
no Complaints either at <HI>Lambeth,</HI> or <HI>White-Hall,</HI> no publick
Invective, no seizing of <HI>Body</HI> and <HI>Goods;</HI> in short, no signs
of the least Dissatisfaction. And who could imagine, that the
bare repeating of an action, should raise such a Storm upon
us now, which was so perfectly inoffensive before? To pu|nish
in this manner without warning, or <HI>Precedent,</HI> without
Canon, or Law, is (with submission) somewhat unintelligible.</P>
<P>And now having defended my self, I shall reply nothing
to all the unkind Reflections, and Tragical Language of the
<HI>Declaration.</HI> 'Tis probably within my power, to turn some
of these <HI>Reverend Prelates</HI> Artillery upon them. But my re|gard
to their Character, and Inclination not to displease,
makes me wave the advantage.</P>
<P>However their extraordinary usage has done me the Ho|nour
of an Opportunity to forgive them, which I thank God
I heartily do.</P>
