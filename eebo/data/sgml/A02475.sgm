<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>REader I present to thy view some few things most obuious and most necessarie for euery mans contemplation. Namely,</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>1 Time, Folly, Reason,</HI> with the mu|tabilitie of all things.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>2 Nature and Art,</HI> the two Parents of all things.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>3 Wealth</HI> and <HI>Pouertie</HI> the two ballances of all things.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>4 Sinne</HI> and <HI>Vertue,</HI> the recompensers of all things.</ITEM>

<P>The first shewes, how <HI>Folly</HI> first entertaines vs at our entrance into the house of <HI>Time,</HI> del<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">|ding vs with a more certaine assurance of things most incertaine (vntill <HI>Reason</HI> approching, brings vs truer releation, shewing the mutabilitie, vn|certainti and change of all things.</P>
<P>In the second, <HI>Art</HI> and <HI>Nature</HI> seeme to vie which of them ought to bee accounted the more in|dulgent mother to mankinde, with many reasons to to intimate whether it were better to be gouerned by <HI>Art &amp; Discipline,</HI> or to liue as some of the West <HI>Indian</HI> sauages <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">o, only by the rule of <HI>Nature.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="4">The third obiects a contentious litigation be|tweene <HI>Wealth</HI> and <HI>Pouertie,</HI> with the most fre|quent obiections vsed on either part, their euents and accidents incident, wherein I must entreate the iudicious Reader not to thinke mee Satericall (as perchance some carper will) but rather that I aime at the <HI>Ideas</HI> of the things, which I protest is truth.</P>
<P>The last seems to demonstrate the misery which <HI>Vertue</HI> suffers vnder the burthen of <HI>Sinne:</HI> wher|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">n <HI>Sinne</HI> seems to erect foure Altars to her selfe, where she receiues adoration and sacrifice from the high and mightie. What the scope of this is, the Reader may quickly see; and it is concluded with that which concludes all things, the last Iudge|ment.</P>
<P>Now for this way of expression that I seeme thu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> to present things past, present, aud to come; the be|ginning progresse, continuance and end of all things in a Dreame.

Whereupon the Keeper of the House tooke home the <HI>Dog,</HI> and held him euer af|ter as a most diligent seruant, the <HI>Dog</HI> waiting still vpon his new Master to the Court, and through the Citie, yet neuer loosing him. But to conclude this Storie; so it happened some certaine time af|ter, that this poore beast following his new Master, spies out amongst a multitude, the Murtherer of his old Master, whom presently he flies vpon, rea|dy to teare him in peeces. The man threatens to kill the <HI>Dog,</HI> if they take him not vp. Hereupon they take off the <HI>Dog,</HI> and tie him vp. But the
<PB N="57" REF="32">
<HI>Dogs</HI> Master (entertaining some scruple) caus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">d the <HI>Dog</HI> to bee loosed againe, to see if againe hee would find out the same man: which done, the <HI>Dog</HI> finds him out streight amongst many others, and there againe flies vpon him in most v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">hement manner. Whereupon they suspected him to bee the Murtherer, carried him before the Iustice, where he presently confest the fact, and died for the same.</P>
<P>A thousand examples of this kind euery man can record out of his owne particular knowledge, there|fore onely two shall be annext out of famous <HI>Iulius Scaliger,</HI> which se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">me to me not lesse effectuall and remarkable, then those more ancient. The first is of a Countrey Fellow in the Ile of <HI>Corsica,</HI> who tracing a <HI>Beare</HI> into the Mountaines in a deepe Snow, onely accompanied with his <HI>Dog,</HI> forgetting the danger through desire to meet with the <HI>Beare,</HI> followes so farre, that when hee would haue retur|ned (all the pathes being fild vp with Snow) hee could not by any meanes discerne his way home againe, so that in fine he is there frozen to death. Some two or three dayes after his friends find him with his <HI>Dog</HI> lying at his feete: but when they come neere to touch him, his <HI>Dog</HI> flies at them, fights, teares, barkes, bites them, puts them all to flight, thinking they came to rob his Master; nei|ther becomes he more gentle by the comming in of
<PB N="58" REF="33">
his masters Brothers, from whom he had oft recei|ued meate, but continues in his pertinacie so long, till they were forced to shoote at him, and to kill him.</P>
<P>The other is a French History of a Courtier, who being offended either with the treacherie of his friend, or else enuying him, secretly kild him, and as secretly buried him in a field not frequented. By chance the man thus slaine had a <HI>Dog</HI> with him, who being not farre off, and seeing his Master thus put in a hole, sat so long vpon his Graue, till his af|fection ouercome with hunger, forc't him to returne backe to the Court. The Chamber-fellowes of the partie thus slaine giue him meate: streight to the Graue againe goes he, but hungrie returnes as be|fore, and so long holds hee this course, till men be|gan to suspect the matter. Heereupon they fol|low him to the place, digge vp the Graue, find the Man, whom knowing they burie, taking the <HI>Dog</HI> home with them. After a while this Murtherer returnes to the Court; the <HI>Dog</HI> spies him, flies vpon him, barkes and bayes at him, and will not bee kept off him. Heereup|on hee growes suspected; yea, the King him|selfe takes notice, through the <HI>Dogges</HI> perse|uerance in this manner of accusation. The King commands him to shew the reason, why the
<PB N="59" REF="33">
<HI>Dogge</HI> dod this. The Man denies the fact, and stands vpon his innocence: but still the <HI>Dogge</HI> barkes, and as much as in him lies, seekes to disturbe him in his excusations. At last therefore the King decrees, to haue the matter tried by combate: Wherein the <HI>Dogge</HI> ouer-came, and his Victorie is pourtrayed in Gold in one of the Kings dining-roomes; and euer as it decayes, is by commandement from the King repaired. <HI>Scalig.</HI> Exercitations 202.

<P>For Magnanimitie, the <HI>Dog</HI> sent to <HI>Alexander</HI> by <HI>Porus</HI> the Indian King, is a sufficient testimo|nie; who when the King commanded <HI>Boares, Harts,</HI> or <HI>Beares</HI> to be set before him, neuer moo|ued at them, as things vnworthy of his courage. But when he lets out a <HI>Lion</HI> to him, him the <HI>Dog</HI> teares in pieces: and then setting him vpon an <HI>Elephant,</HI> him also hee brings to the ground. <HI>Quintus Curtius,</HI> and <HI>Plinnius, liber. 8. cap. 40.</HI></P>

If his Keeper mingle his prouant with straw and chaffe, and deceaue him of halfe his allowance, hee thinkes it enough of hee can get loose to doe as much to the Keepers Porrege-pot, as

<P>(29) Where shall a man see the office of a more faithfull seruant, then in <HI>Porus Elephant?</HI> who when his Master's mortally wounded in the battaile against <HI>Alexander,</HI> and sainting through losse of blood, the beast perceiuing him about to fall, kneeles gently downe to let his Lord descend with more ease. But when the Souldiers run to disarme him, the beast drawes courage from his wounds, sets vpon them afresh, beats them off him, and then striues to reseate his Master againe vpon his backe, neuer giuing ouer to discharge the part of a loyall seruant till he fell downe dead with wounds in the place. <HI>Q.
