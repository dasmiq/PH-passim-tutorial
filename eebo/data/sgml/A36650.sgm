<HEAD>Mac Flecknoe.</HEAD>
<L>ALL humane things are subject to decay,</L>
<L>And, when Fate summons, Monarchs must obey&punc;</L>
<L>This <HI>Fleckno</HI> found, who, like <HI>Augustus,</HI> young</L>
<L>Was call'd to Empire, and had govern'd long:</L>
<L>In Prose and Verse, was own'd, without dispute</L>
<L>Through all the Realms of <HI>Non-sense,</HI> absolute.</L>
<L>This aged Prince now flourishing in Peace,</L>
<L>And blest with issue of a large increase,</L>
<L>Worn out with business, did at length debate</L>
<L>To settle the succession of the State:</L>
<L>And pond'ring which of all his Sons was fit</L>
<L>To Reign, and wage immortal War with Wit;</L>
<L>Cry'd, 'tis resolv'd; for Nature pleads that He</L>
<L>Should onely rule, who most resembles me:</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="6">
<HI>Sh</HI>&mdash;alone my perfect image bears,</L>
<L>Mature in dullness from his tender years.</L>
<L><HI>Sh</HI>&mdash;alone, of all my Sons, is he</L>
<L>Who stands confirm'd in full stupidity.</L>
<L>The rest to some faint meaning make pretence,</L>
<L>But <HI>Sh</HI>&mdash;never deviates into sense.</L>
<L>Some Beams of Wit on other souls may fall,</L>
<L>Strike through and make a lucid intervall;</L>
<L>But <HI>Sh</HI>&mdash;'s genuine night admits no ray,</L>
<L>His rising Fogs prevail upon the Day:</L>
<L>Besides his goodly Fabrick fills the eye,</L>
<L>And seems design'd for thoughtless Majesty:</L>
<L>Thoughtless as Monarch Oakes, that shade the plain,</L>
<L>And, spread in solemn state, supinely reign.</L>
<L><HI>Heywood</HI> and <HI>Shirley</HI> were but Types of thee,</L>
<L>Thou last great Prophet of Tautology:</L>
<L>Even I, a dunce of more renown than they,</L>
<L>Was sent before but to prepare thy way;</L>
<L>And coursly clad in <HI>Norwich</HI> Drugget came</L>
<L>To teach the Nations in thy greater name.</L>
<L>My warbling Lute, the Lute I whilom strung</L>
<L>When to King <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Portugal</HI> I sung,</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="6">
Was but the prelude to that glorious day,</L>
<L>When thou on silver <HI>Thames</HI> did'st cut thy way,</L>
<L>With well tim'd Oars before the Royal Barge,</L>
<L>Swell'd with the Pride of thy Celestial charge;</L>
<L>And big with Hymn, Commander of an Host,</L>
<L>The like was ne'er in <HI>Epsom</HI> Blankets tost.</L>
<L>Methinks I see the new <HI>Arion</HI> Sail,</L>
<L>The Lute still trembling underneath thy nail.</L>
<L>At thy well sharpned thumb from Shore to Shore</L>
<L>The Treble squeaks for fear, the Bases roar:</L>
<L>Echoes from <HI>Pissing-Ally, Sh</HI>&mdash;call,</L>
<L>And <HI>Sh</HI>&mdash;they resound from <HI>A&mdash;Hall.</HI></L>
<L>About thy boat the little Fishes throng,</L>
<L>As at the Morning Toast, that Floats along.</L>
<L>Sometimes as Prince of thy Harmonious band</L>
<L>Thou weild'st thy Papers in thy threshing hand.</L>
<L>St. <HI>Andre</HI>'s feet ne'er kept more equal time,</L>
<L>Not ev'n the feet of thy own <HI>Psyche</HI>'s rhime:</L>
<L>Though they in number as in sense excell;</L>
<L>So just, so like tautology they fell,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="7">
That, pale with envy, <HI>Singleton</HI> forswore</L>
<L>The Lute and Sword which he in Triumph bore,</L>
<L>And vow'd he ne'er would act <HI>Villerius</HI> more.</L>
<L>Here stopt the good old <HI>Syre;</HI> and wept for joy</L>
<L>In silent raptures of the hopefull boy.</L>
<L>All arguments, but most his Plays, perswade,</L>
<L>That for anointed dullness he was made.</L>
<L>Close to the Walls which fair <HI>Augusta</HI> bind,</L>
<L>(The fair <HI>Augusta</HI> much to fears inclin'd)</L>
<L>An ancient fabrick, rais'd t' inform the sight,</L>
<L>There stood of yore, and <HI>Barbican</HI> it hight:</L>
<L>A watch Tower once; but now, so Fate ordains,</L>
<L>Of all the Pile an empty name remains.</L>
<L>From its old Ruins Brothel-houses rise,</L>
<L>Scenes of lewd loves, and of polluted joys.</L>
<L>Where their vast Courts the Mother-Strumpets keep,</L>
<L>And, undisturb'd by Watch, in silence sleep.</L>
<L>Near these a Nursery erects its head,</L>
<L>Where Queens are form'd, and future Hero's bred;</L>
<L>Where unfledg'd Actors learn to laugh and cry,</L>
<L>Where infant Punks their tender Voices try,</L>
<L>And little <HI>Maximins</HI> the Gods defy.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7">
Great <HI>Fletcher</HI> never treads in Buskins here,</L>
<L>Nor greater <HI>Iohnson</HI> dares in Socks appear.</L>
<L>But gentle <HI>Simkin</HI> just reception finds</L>
<L>Amidst this Monument of vanisht minds:</L>
<L>Pure Clinches, the suburbian Muse affords;</L>
<L>And <HI>Panton</HI> waging harmless War with words.</L>
<L>Here <HI>Fleckno,</HI> as a place to Fame well known,</L>
<L>Ambitiously design'd his <HI>Sh</HI>&mdash;'s Throne.</L>
<L>For ancient <HI>Decker</HI> prophesi'd long since,</L>
<L>That in this Pile should Reign a mighty Prince,</L>
<L>Born for a scourge of Wit, and flayle of Sense:</L>
<L>To whom true dulness should some <HI>Psyches</HI> owe,</L>
<L>But Worlds of <HI>Misers</HI> from his pen should flow;</L>
<L><HI>Humorists</HI> and Hypocrites it should produce,</L>
<L>Whole <HI>Raymond</HI> families, and Tribes of <HI>Bruce.</HI></L>
<L>Now Empress <HI>Fame</HI> had publisht the renown,</L>
<L>Of <HI>Sh</HI>&mdash;'s Coronation through the Town.</L>
<L>Rows'd by report of Fame, the Nations meet,</L>
<L>From near <HI>Bun-Hill,</HI> and distant <HI>Watling-street.</HI></L>
<L>No <HI>Persian</HI> Carpets spread th' Imperial way,</L>
<L>But scatter'd Limbs of mangled Poets lay:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="8">
From dusty shops neglected Authors come,</L>
<L>Martyrs of Pies, and Reliques of the Bum.</L>
<L>Much <HI>Heywood, Shirly, Ogleby</HI> there lay,</L>
<L>But loads of <HI>Sh</HI>&mdash;almost choakt the way.</L>
<L>Bilk't <HI>Stationers</HI> for Yeomen stood prepar'd,</L>
<L>And <HI>H</HI>&mdash;was Captain of the Guard.</L>
<L>The hoary Prince in Majesty appear'd,</L>
<L>High on a Throne of his own Labours rear'd.</L>
<L>At his right hand our young <HI>Ascanius</HI> sat</L>
<L><HI>Rome</HI>'s other hope, and pillar of the State.</L>
<L>His Brows thick fogs, instead of glories, grace,</L>
<L>And lambent dullness plaid arround his face.</L>
<L>As <HI>Hannibal</HI> did to the Altars come,</L>
<L>Sworn by his <HI>Syre</HI> a mortal Foe to <HI>Rome;</HI></L>
<L>So <HI>Sh</HI>&mdash;swore, nor should his Vow bee vain,</L>
<L>That he till Death true dullness would maintain;</L>
<L>And in his father's Right, and Realms defence,</L>
<L>Ne'er to have peace with Wit, nor truce with Sense,</L>
<L>The King himself the sacred Unction made,</L>
<L>As King by Office, and as Priest by Trade:</L>
<L>In his sinister hand, instead of Ball,</L>
<L>He plac'd a mighty Mug of potent Ale;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="8">
Love's Kingdom to his right he did convey,</L>
<L>At once his Sceptre and his rule of Sway;</L>
<L>Whose righteous Lore the Prince had practis'd young,</L>
<L>And from whose Loyns recorded <HI>Psyche</HI> sprung.</L>
<L>His Temples last with Poppies were o'erspread,</L>
<L>That nodding seem'd to consecrate his head:</L>
<L>Just at that point of time, if Fame not lye,</L>
<L>On his left hand twelve reverend <HI>Owls</HI> did fly.</L>
<L>So <HI>Romulus,</HI> 'tis sung, by <HI>Tyber</HI>'s <HI>Brook,</HI></L>
<L>Presage of Sway from twice six Vultures took.</L>
<L>Th' admiring throng loud acclamations make,</L>
<L>And Omens of his future Empire take.</L>
<L>The <HI>Syre</HI> then shook the honours of his head,</L>
<L>And from his brows damps of oblivion shed</L>
<L>Full on the filial dullness: long he stood,</L>
<L>Repelling from his Breast the raging God;</L>
<L>At length burst out in this prophetick mood:</L>
<L>Heavens bless my Son, from <HI>Ireland</HI> let him reign</L>
<L>To farr <HI>Barbadoes</HI> on the Western main;</L>
<L>Of his Dominion may no end be known,</L>
<L>And greater than his Father's be his Throne.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="9">
Beyond loves Kingdom let him stretch his Pen;</L>
<L>He paus'd, and all the people cry'd <HI>Amen.</HI></L>
<L>Then thus, continu'd he, my Son advance</L>
<L>Still in new Impudence, new Ignorance.</L>
<L>Success let others teach, learn thou from me</L>
<L>Pangs without birth, and fruitless Industry.</L>
<L>Let <HI>Virtuoso's</HI> in five years be Writ;</L>
<L>Yet not one thought accuse thy toyl of wit.</L>
<L>Let gentle <HI>George</HI> in triumph tread the Stage,</L>
<L>Make <HI>Dorimant</HI> betray, and <HI>Loveit</HI> rage;</L>
<L>Let <HI>Cully, Cockwood, Fopling,</HI> charm the Pit,</L>
<L>And in their folly shew the Writers wit.</L>
<L>Yet still thy fools shall stand in thy defence,</L>
<L>And justifie their Author's want of sense.</L>
<L>Let 'em be all by thy own model made</L>
<L>Of dullness, and desire no foreign aid:</L>
<L>That they to future ages may be known,</L>
<L>Not Copies drawn, but Issue of thy own.</L>
<L>Nay let thy men of wit too be the same,</L>
<L>All full of thee, and differing but in name;</L>
<L>But let no alien <HI>S&mdash;dl&mdash;y</HI> interpose</L>
<L>To lard with wit thy hungry <HI>Epsom</HI> prose.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="9">
And when false flowers of <HI>Rhetorick</HI> thou would'st cull,</L>
<L>Trust Nature, do not labour to be dull;</L>
<L>But write thy best, and top; and in each line,</L>
<L>Sir <HI>Formal's</HI> oratory will be thine.</L>
<L>Sir <HI>Formal,</HI> though unsought, attends thy quill,</L>
<L>And does thy <HI>Northern Dedications</HI> fill.</L>
<L>Nor let false friends seduce thy mind to fame,</L>
<L>By arrogating <HI>Iohnson</HI>'s Hostile name.</L>
<L>Let Father <HI>Fleckno</HI> fire thy mind with praise,</L>
<L>And Uncle <HI>Ogleby</HI> thy envy raise.</L>
<L>Thou art my blood, where <HI>Iohnson</HI> has no part;</L>
<L>What share have we in Nature or in Art?</L>
<L>Where did his wit on learning fix a brand,</L>
<L>And rail at Arts he did not understand?</L>
<L>Where made he love in Prince <HI>Nicander</HI>'s vein,</L>
<L>Or swept the dust in <HI>Psyche</HI>'s humble strain?</L>
<L>Where sold he Bargains, Whip-stitch, kiss my Arse,</L>
<L>Promis'd a Play and dwindled to a Farce?</L>
<L>When did his Muse from <HI>Fletcher</HI> scenes purloin,</L>
<L>As thou whole <HI>Eth'ridg</HI> dost tranfuse to thine?</L>
<L>But so transfus'd as Oylon Waters flow,</L>
<L>His always floats above, thine sinks below.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="10">
This is thy Province, this thy wondrous way,</L>
<L>New Humours to invent for each new Play:</L>
<L>This is that boasted Byas of thy mind,</L>
<L>By which one way, to dullness, 'tis inclin'd.</L>
<L>Which makes thy writings lean on oneside still,</L>
<L>And in all changes that way bends thy will.</L>
<L>Nor let thy mountain belly make pretence</L>
<L>Of likeness; thine's a tympany of sense.</L>
<L>A Tun of Man in thy Large bulk is writ,</L>
<L>But sure thou'rt but a Kilderkin of wit.</L>
<L>Like mine thy gentle numbers feebly creep,</L>
<L>Thy Tragick Muse gives smiles, thy Comick sleep.</L>
<L>With whate'er gall thou sett'st thy self to write,</L>
<L>Thy inoffensive Satyrs never bite.</L>
<L>In thy fellonious heart, though Venom lies,</L>
<L>It does but touch thy <HI>Irish</HI> pen, and dyes.</L>
<L>Thy Genius calls thee not to purchase fame</L>
<L>In keen Iambicks, but mild Anagram:</L>
<L>Leave writing Plays, and chuse for thy command</L>
<L>Some peacefull Province in Acrostick Land.</L>
<L>There thou maist wings display and Altars raise,</L>
<L>And torture one poor word Ten thousand ways.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="10">
Or if thou would'st thy diff'rent talents suit,</L>
<L>Set thy own Songs, and sing them to thy lute.</L>
<L>He said, but his last words were scarcely heard,</L>
<L>For <HI>Bruce</HI> and <HI>Longvil</HI> had a <HI>Trap</HI> prepar'd,</L>
<L>And down they sent the yet declaiming Bard.</L>
<L>Sinking he left his Drugget robe behind,</L>
<L>Born upwards by A subterranean wind.</L>
<L>The Mantle fell to the young Prophet's part,</L>
<L>With double portion of his Father's Art.</L>

<HEAD>TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS not my intention to make an Apology for my
<HI>Poem:</HI> Some will think it needs no Excuse;
and others will receive none. The Design, I am sure,
is honest: but he who draws his Pen for one Party,
must expect to make Enemies of the other. For, <HI>Wit</HI>
and <HI>Fool,</HI> are Consequents of <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory:</HI> And
every man is a Knave or an Ass to the contrary side.
There's a Treasury of Merits in the <HI>Phanatick Church,</HI>
as well as in the <HI>Papist;</HI> and a Pennyworth to be had
of Saintship, Honesty and Poetry, for the Leud,
the Factious, and the Blockheads: But the longest
Chapter in <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> has not Curses enough for
an Anti-<HI>Bromingham.</HI> My Comfort is, their mani|fest
Prejudice to my Cause, will render their Iudge|ment
of less Authority against me. Yet if a <HI>Poem</HI>
have a <HI>Genius,</HI> it will force its own reception in the
World. For there's a sweetness in good Verse, which
Tickles even while it Hurts: And no man can be
heartily angry with him, who pleases him against his
will. The Commendation of Adversaries, is the
greatest Triumph of a Writer; because it never comes
unless Extorted. But I can be satisfied on more easie
<PB N="16" REF="13">
terms: If I happen to please the more Moderate
sort I shall be sure of an honest Party; and, in all
probability, of the best Iudges: for, the least Con|cern'd,
are commonly the least Corrupt. And, I con|fess,
I have laid in for those, by rebating the <HI>Satyr</HI>
(where Iustice woud allow it) from carrying too sharp
an Edge. They, who can Criticize so weakly, as to
imagine I have done my Worst, may be convinc'd, at
their own Cost, that I can write Severely, with more
ease, than I can Gently. I have but laugh'd at some
mens Follies, when I coud have declaim'd against
their Vices: and, other mens Vertues I have commend|ed,
as freely as I have tax'd their Crimes. And
now, if you are a Malicious <HI>Reader,</HI> I expect you
should return upon me, that I affect to be thought
more Impartial than I am. But, if men are not to
be judg'd by their Professions, God forgive you <HI>Com|mon-wealths
men,</HI> for Professing so plausibly for the
Government. You cannot be so Vnconscionable, as to
charge me for not Subscribing of my Name; for that
woud reflect too grosly vpon your own Party, who never
dare; though they have the advantage of a Iury to
secure them. If you like not my <HI>Poem,</HI> the fault may,
possibly, be in my Writing: (though 'tis hard for an
Author to judge against himself;) But more probably
'tis in your Morals, which cannot bear the truth of it.
The Violent, on both sides, will condemn the Character
of <HI>Absalom,</HI> as either too favourably, or too hardly
drawn. But they are not the Violent, whom I desire
to please. The fault, on the right hand, is to Exten|uate,
Palliate and Indulge; and, to confess freely, I
<PB N="17" REF="13">
have endeavoured to commit it. Besides the respect
which I owe his Birth, I have a greater for his Heroick
Virtues: and, <HI>David</HI> himself, could not be more tender of
the Young-man's Life, than I would be of his Reputation.
But, since the most excellent natures are always the most
easie; and, as being such, are the soonest perverted by
ill Counsels, especially when baited with Fame and
Glory; 'tis no more a wonder that he withstood not the
temptations of <HI>Achitophel,</HI> than it was for <HI>Adam,</HI> not
to have resisted the two Devils, the Serpent and the
Woman. The conclusion of the Story, I purposely for|bore
to prosecute: because, I could not obtain from my
self, to shew <HI>Absalom</HI> Vnfortunate. The Frame of it,
was cut out, but for a Picture to the Waste; and, if the
Draught be so far true, 'tis as much as I design'd.</P>
<P>Were I the Inventor, who am onely the Historian,
I should certainly conclude the Piece, with the Recon|cilement
of <HI>Absalom</HI> to <HI>David.</HI> And, who knows but
this may come to pass? Things were not brought to an
Extremity where I left the Story; There seems, yet,
to be room left for a Composure; hereafter, there may
onely be for Pity. I have not so much as an uncharitable
wish against <HI>Achitophel;</HI> but, am content to be Accus'd
of a good natur'd Errour; and to hope with <HI>Origen,</HI> that
the Devil himself may, at last, be sav'd. For which
reason, in this <HI>Poem,</HI> he is neither brought to set his
House in order, nor to dispose of his Person afterwards,
as he in Wisedom shall think fit. God is infinitely mer|cifull;
and his Vicegerent is onely not so, because he is
not Infinite.</P>
<P>The true end of <HI>Satyr,</HI> is the amendment of Vices
<PB N="18" REF="14">
by correction. And he who writes Honestly, is no more
an Enemy to the Offender, than the Physician to the
Patient, when he prescribes harsh Remedies to an in|veterate
Disease: for those, are onely in order to pre|vent
the Chyrurgeon's work of an <HI>Ense rescindendum,</HI>
which I wish not to my very Enemies. To conclude all;
If the Body Politique have any Analogy to the Natural
in my weak judgment, an Act of <HI>Oblivion</HI> were as
necessary in a Hot, Distemper'd State, as an <HI>Opiate</HI>
would be in a Raging Fever.</P>

<HEAD>ABSALOM

ACHITOPHEL.</HEAD>
<HEAD>A POEM.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>IN pious Times, e'er Priest-Craft did begin,</L>
<L>Before <HI>Polygamy</HI> was made a Sin;</L>
<L>When Man on many, multipli'd his kind,</L>
<L>E'er one to one was, cursedly, confin'd:</L>
<L>When Nature prompted, and no Law deni'd</L>
<L>Promiscuous use of Concubine and Bride;</L>
<L>Then, <HI>Israel</HI>'s Monarch, after Heavens own heart,</L>
<L>His vigorous warmth did variously, impart.</L>
<L><PB N="26" REF="18">
To Wives and Slaves: and, wide as his Command,</L>
<L>Scatter'd his Maker's Image through the Land.</L>
<L><HI>Michal,</HI> of Royal Blood, the Crown did wear;</L>
<L>A Soil ungratefull to the Tiller's care:</L>
<L>Not so the rest; for several Mothers bore</L>
<L>To God-like <HI>David,</HI> several Sons before.</L>
<L>But, since like Slaves his Bed they did ascend,</L>
<L>No true Succession cou'd their Seed attend.</L>
<L>Of all the Numerous Progeny was none</L>
<L>So Beautifull, so Brave as <HI>Absalon:</HI></L>
<L>Whether, inspir'd by some diviner Lust,</L>
<L>His Father got him with a greater Gust;</L>
<L>Or that his Conscious Destiny made way,</L>
<L>By manly Beauty to Imperial Sway.</L>
<L>Early in Foreign Fields he won Renown,</L>
<L>With Kings and States alli'd to <HI>Israel</HI>'s Crown:</L>
<L>In Peace the thoughts of War he cou'd remove,</L>
<L>And seem'd as he were onely born for Love.</L>
<L>What e'er he did, was done with so much ease,</L>
<L>In him alone, 'twas Natural to please:</L>
<L>His motions all accompani'd with grace;</L>
<L>And <HI>Paradise</HI> was open'd in his face.</L>
<L><PB N="27" REF="18">
With secret Joy, indulgent <HI>David</HI> view'd</L>
<L>His Youthfull Image in his Son renew'd:</L>
<L>To all his wishes nothing he deni'd;</L>
<L>And made the Charming <HI>Annabel</HI> his Bride.</L>
<L>What faults he had (for who from faults is free?)</L>
<L>His Father cou'd not, or he wou'd not see.</L>
<L>Some warm excesses, which the Law forbore,</L>
<L>Where constru'd Youth that purg'd by boiling o'er:</L>
<L>And <HI>Amnon</HI>'s Murther, by a specious Name,</L>
<L>Was call'd a Just Revenge for injur'd Fame.</L>
<L>Thus Prais'd, and Lov'd, the Noble Youth remain'd,</L>
<L>While <HI>David,</HI> undisturb'd in <HI>Sion</HI> reign'd.</L>
<L>But Life can never be sincerely blest:</L>
<L>Heav'n punishes the bad, and proves the best.</L>
<L>The <HI>Iews,</HI> a Head-strong, Moody, Murm'ring race,</L>
<L>As ever try'd th' extent and stretch of grace;</L>
<L>God's pamper'd People whom, debauch'd with ease,</L>
<L>No King cou'd govern, nor no God cou'd please;</L>
<L>(Gods they had try'd of every shape and size,</L>
<L>That God-smiths cou'd produce, or Priests devise:)</L>
<L>These <HI>Adam</HI>-wits, too fortunately free,</L>
<L>Began to dream they wanted Liberty,</L>
<L><PB N="28" REF="19">
And when no rule, no president was found,</L>
<L>Of men, by Laws less circumscrib'd and bound;</L>
<L>They led their wild desires to Woods and Caves;</L>
<L>And thought that all but Savages were Slaves.</L>
<L>They who, when <HI>Saul</HI> was dead, without a blow,</L>
<L>Made foolish <HI>Ishbosheth</HI> the Crown forego;</L>
<L>Who banisht <HI>David</HI> did from <HI>Hebron</HI> bring,</L>
<L>And, with a General shout, proclaim'd him King:</L>
<L>Those very <HI>Iews,</HI> who, at their very best,</L>
<L>Their Humour more than Loyalty exprest,</L>
<L>Now, wondred why, so long, they had obey'd</L>
<L>An Idol-Monarch which their hands had made:</L>
<L>Thought they might ruine him they cou'd create;</L>
<L>Or melt him to that Golden Calf, a State.</L>
<L>But these were random Bolts: No form'd Design,</L>
<L>Nor Interest made the Factious Croud to joyn:</L>
<L>The sober part of <HI>Israel,</HI> free from stain,</L>
<L>Well knew the value of a peacefull Reign;</L>
<L>And, looking backward with a wise afright,</L>
<L>Saw Seams of wounds, dishonest to the sight:</L>
<L>In contemplation of whose ugly Scars,</L>
<L>They curst the memory of Civil Wars.</L>
<L><PB N="29" REF="19">
The moderate sort of Men, thus qualifi'd,</L>
<L>Inclin'd the Ballance to the better side:</L>
<L>And, <HI>David</HI>'s mildness manag'd it so well,</L>
<L>The bad found no occasion to Rebell.</L>
<L>But, when to Sin our byast Nature leans,</L>
<L>The carefull Devil is still at hand with means;</L>
<L>And providently Pimps for ill desires;</L>
<L>The Good Old Cause reviv'd, a Plot requires.</L>
<L>Plots, true or false, are necessary things,</L>
<L>To raise up Common-wealths, and ruine Kings.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Th' Inhabitants of old <HI>Ierusalem</HI></L>
<L>Were <HI>Iebusites:</HI> the Town so call'd from them;</L>
<L>And their's the Native right&mdash;</L>
<L>But when the chosen People grew more strong,</L>
<L>The rightfull cause at length became the wrong:</L>
<L>And every loss the men of <HI>Iebus</HI> bore,</L>
<L>They still were thought God'<HI>s</HI> enemies the more.</L>
<L>Thus, worn and weakn'd, well or ill content,</L>
<L>Submit they must to <HI>David</HI>'s Government:</L>
<L>Impoverish't and depriv'd of all Command,</L>
<L>Their Taxes doubled as they lost their Land;</L>
<L><PB N="30" REF="20">
And, what was harder yet to flesh and blood,</L>
<L>Their Gods disgrac'd, and burnt like Common Wood.</L>
<L>This set the Heathen Priesthood in a flame;</L>
<L>For Priests of all Religions are the same:</L>
<L>Of whatsoe'er descent their Godhead be,</L>
<L>Stock, Stone, or other homely Pedigree,</L>
<L>In his Defence his Servants are as bold,</L>
<L>As if he had been born of beaten Gold.</L>
<L>The <HI>Iewish Rabbins,</HI> though their Enemies,</L>
<L>In this conclude them honest Men and wise:</L>
<L>For 'twas their Duty, all the Learned think,</L>
<L>T' espouse his Cause by whom they eat and drink.</L>
<L>From hence began that Plot, the Nations Curse,</L>
<L>Bad in it self, but represented worse.</L>
<L>Rais'd in extremes, and in extremes decry'd;</L>
<L>With Oaths affirm'd, with dying Vows deny'd.</L>
<L>Not weigh'd, or winnow'd by the Multitude;</L>
<L>But swallow'd in the Mass, unchew'd and crude.</L>
<L>Some Truth there was, but dash't and brew'd with Lies,</L>
<L>To please the Fools, and puzzle all the Wise.</L>
<L>Succeeding Times did equal Folly call,</L>
<L>Believing nothing, or believing all.</L>
<L><PB N="31" REF="20">
Th' <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Rites the <HI>Iebusites</HI> embrac'd;</L>
<L>Where Gods were recommended by their taste.</L>
<L>Such sav'ry Deities must needs be good,</L>
<L>As serv'd at once for Worship and for Food.</L>
<L>By <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">orce they could not Introduce these Gods;</L>
<L>For Ten to One, in former days was odds.</L>
<L>So Fraud was us'd, (the Sacrificers Trade,)</L>
<L>Fools are more hard to conquer than Perswade.</L>
<L>Their busie Teachers mingled with the <HI>Iews;</HI></L>
<L>And rak'd for Converts, even the Court and Stews:</L>
<L>Which <HI>Hebrew Priests</HI> the more unkindly took,</L>
<L>Because the Fleece accompanies the Flock.</L>
<L>Some thought they God's Anointed meant to slay</L>
<L>By Guns, invented since full many a day:</L>
<L>Our Authour swears it not; but who can know</L>
<L>How far the Devil and <HI>Iebusites</HI> may go?</L>
<L>This <HI>Plot,</HI> which fail'd for want of common Sense,</L>
<L>Had yet a deep and dangerous Consequence:</L>
<L>For as when raging Fevers boil the Blood,</L>
<L>The standing Lake soon floats into a Floud;</L>
<L>And ev'ry hostile Humour, which before</L>
<L>Slept quiet in its Chanels, bubbles o'er:</L>
<L><PB N="32" REF="21">
So, several factions from this first Ferment,</L>
<L>Work up to Foam, and threat the Government.</L>

<L>A fiery Soul, which working out its way,</L>

<HEAD>EPISTLE
To the
WHIGS.</HEAD>
<P>FOR to whom can I dedicate this <HI>Poem,</HI> with
so much justice, as to you? 'Tis the representa|tion
of your own Heroe: 'tis the Picture drawn
at length, which you admire and prize so much in
little. None of your Ornaments are wanting; neither
the Landscap of the Tower, nor the Rising Sun; nor
the <HI>Anno Domini</HI> of your New Sovereign's Coronation.
This must needs be a gratefull undertaking to your
whole Party: especially to those who have not been so
happy as to purchase the Original. I hear the <HI>Graver</HI>
has made a good Market of it: all his Kings are
bought up already; or the value of the remainder so
inhanc'd, that many a poor <HI>Polander,</HI> who would be
glad to worship the Image, is not able to go to the
cost of him: But must be content to see him here. I
must confess I am no great Artist; but Sign-post pain|ting
will serve the turn to remember a Friend by;
especially when better is not to be had. Yet for your
comfort the lineaments are true: and though he sate
<PB N="78" REF="44">
not five times to me, as he did to <HI>B.</HI> yet I have con|sulted
History; as the <HI>Italian</HI> Painters do, when they
wou'd draw a <HI>Nero</HI> or a <HI>Caligula;</HI> though they have
not seen the Man, they can help their Imagination
by a Statue of him, and find out the Colouring from
<HI>Suetonius</HI> and <HI>Tacitus.</HI> Truth is, you might have
spar'd one side of your Medall: the Head wou'd be
seen to more advantage, if it were plac'd on a Spike
of the Tower; a little nearer to the Sun. Which
wou'd then break out to better purpose. You tell us
in your Preface to the <HI>No-protestant Plot,</HI> that you
shall be forc'd hereafter to leave off your Modesty: I
suppose you mean that little which is left you: for it
was worn to wrags when you put out this Medall.
Never was there practis'd such a piece of notorious Im|pudence
in the face of an Establish'd Government.
I believe, when he is dead, you will wear him in Thumb-Rings,
as the <HI>Turks</HI> did <HI>Scanderbeg;</HI> as if there
were virtue in his Bones to preserve you against Mon|archy.
Yet all this while you pretend not onely zeal
for the Publick good, but a due veneration for the
person of the King. But all men, who can see an inch
before them, may easily detect those gross fallacies.
That it is necessary for men in your circumstances to
pretend both, is granted you; for without them there
could be no ground to raise a Faction. But I would
ask you one civil question, what right has any man a|mong
you, or any Association of men, (to come nearer
to you,) who out of Parliament, cannot be consider'd
in a publick Capacity, to meet, as you daily do, in
Factious Clubs, to vilify the Government, in your
<PB N="79" REF="44">
Discourses, and to libel it in all your Writings? who
made you Iudges in <HI>Israel?</HI> or how is it consistent with
your Zeal of the publick Welfare, to promote Sedition?
Does your definition of loyal, which is to serve the
King according to the Laws, allow you the licence
of traducing the Executive Power, with which you own
he is invested? You complain that his Majesty has lost
the love and confidence of his People; and by your very
urging it, you endeavour what in you lies, to make
him lose them. All good Subjects abhor the thought
of Arbitrary Power, whether it be in one or many:
if you were the Patriots you would seem, you would
not at this rate incense the Multitud&egrave; to assume it;
for no sober man can fear it, either from the King's
Disposition, or his Practice; or even, where you would
odiously lay it, from his Ministers. Give us leave
to enjoy the Government and the benefit of Laws
under which we were born, and which we desire to
transmit to our Posterity. You are not the Trustees
of the publick Liberty: and if you have not right
to petition in a Crdoud, much less have you to intermed|dle
in the management of Affairs; or to arraign what
you do not like: which in effect is every thing that is
done by the King and Council. Can you imagine that
any reasonable man will believe you respect the person
of his Majesty, when 'tis apparent that you Seditious
Pamphlets are stuff'd with particular Reflexions on
him? If you have the confidence to deny this, 'tis easy
to be evinc'd from a thousand Passages, which I onely
forbear to quote, because I desire they should die and
be forgotten. I have perus'd many of your Papers;
<PB N="80" REF="45">
and to shew you that I have, the third part of
your <HI>No-protestant Plot</HI> is much of it stoln from
your dead Authour's Pamphlet call'd, the <HI>Growth of
Popery;</HI> as manifestly as <HI>Milton's</HI> defence of the
<HI>English</HI> People, is from <HI>Buchanan, de jure regni apud
Scotos:</HI> or your first Covenant, and new Association,
from the holy League of the <HI>French Guisards.</HI> Any one
who reads <HI>Davila,</HI> may trace your Practices all along.
There were the same pretences for Reformation, and
Loyalty, the same Aspersions of the King, and the
same grounds of a Rebellion. I know not whether you
will take the Historian's word, who says it was re|ported,
that <HI>Poltrot</HI> a <HI>Hugonot,</HI> murther'd <HI>Francis</HI>
Duke of <HI>Guise</HI> by the instigations of <HI>Theodore Beza:</HI>
or that it was a <HI>Hugonot</HI> Minister, otherwise call'd
a <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> (for our Church abhors so devilish a
Tenet) who first writ a Treatise of the lawfullness of
deposing and murthering Kings, of a different Perswa|sion
in Religion: But I am able to prove from the
Doctrine of <HI>Calvin,</HI> and Principles of <HI>Buchanan,</HI> that
they set the People above the Magistrate; which if I
mistake not, is your own Fundamental; and which
carries your Loyalty no farther than your likeing.
When a Vote of the House of Commons goes on your
side, you are as ready to observe it, as if it were
pass'd into a Law: But when you are pinch'd with
any former, and yet unrepealed <HI>Act of Parliament,</HI>
you declare that in same cases, you will not be oblig'd
by it. The Passage is in the same third part of the
<HI>No-protestant Plot;</HI> and is too plain to be denied.
The late Copy of your intended Association&punc; you neither
<PB N="81" REF="45">
wholly justify nor condemn; But, as the Papists, when
they are unoppos'd, fly out into all the Pageantries of
Worship; but in times of War, when they are hard
press'd by Arguments, lie close intrench'd behind the
<HI>Council of Trent:</HI> So, now, when your Affairs are
in a low condition, you dare not pretend that to be a
legal Combination, but whensoever you are afloat, I
doubt not but it will be maintain'd and justify'd to
purpose. For indeed there is nothing to defend it but
the Sword: 'tis the proper time to say any thing,
when men have all things in their power.</P>
<P>In the mean time you wou'd fain be nibbling at a
parallel betwixt this Association, and that in the time
of Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> But there is this small difference
betwixt them, that the ends of one are directly opposite
to the other: one with the Queen'<HI>s</HI> approbation, and
conjunction, as head of it; the other without either
the consent, or knowledge of the King, against whose
Authority it is manifestly design'd. Therefore you doe
well to have recourse to your last Evasion, that it was
contriv'd by your Enemies, and shuffled into the Pa|pers
that were seiz'd: which yet you see the Nation
is not so easy to believe as your own Iury; But the
matter is not difficult, to find twelve men in <HI>New-gate,</HI>
who wou'd acquit a Malefactour.</P>
<P>I have one onely favour to desire of you at parting,
that when you think of answering this <HI>Poem,</HI> you
wou'd employ the same Pens against it, who have com|bated
with so much success against <HI>Absalom</HI> and
<HI>Achitophel:</HI> for then you may assure your selves of a
clear Victory, without the least reply. Raile at me
<PB N="82" REF="46">
abundantly; and, not to break a Custome, doe it with|out
wit: By this method you will gain a considerable
point, which is wholly to wave the answer of my Ar|guments.
Never own the botome of your Principles,
for fear they shou'd be Treason. Fall severely on
the miscarriages of Government; for if scandal be not
allow'd, you are no freeborn subjects. If God has not
bless'd you with the Talent of Rhiming, make use of
my poor Stock and wellcome: let your Verses run upon
my feet: and for the utmost refuge of notorious Block|heads,
reduc'd to the last extremity of sense, turn my
own lines upon me, and in utter despair of your own Sa|tyre,
make me Satyrize my self. Some of you have
been driven to this Bay already; But above all the
rest commend me to the Non-conformist Parson, who
writ the <HI>Whip and Key.</HI> I am affraid it is not read
so much as the Piece deserves, because the Bookseller is
every week crying help at the end of his <HI>Gazette,</HI> to
get it off. You see I am charitable enough to doe him
a kindness, that it may be publish'd as well as printed;
and that so much skill in Hebrew Derivations, may
not lie for Wast-paper in the Shop. Yet I half suspect
he went no farther for his learning, than the Index of
Hebrew Names and Etymologies, which are printed
at the end of some <HI>English</HI> Bibles. If <HI>Achitophel</HI>
signify the Brother of a Fool, the Authour of that
Poem will pass with his Readers for the next of kin.
And perhaps 'tis the Relation that makes the kindness.
Whatever the Verses are; buy 'em up I beseech you
out of pity; for I hear the Conventicle is shut up, and
the Brother of <HI>Achitophel</HI> out of service.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="46">
Now Footmen, you know, have the generosity to
make a Purse, for a Member of their Society, who has
had his Livery pull'd over his Ears: and even Pro|testant
Socks are bought up among you, out of venera|tion
to the name. A Dissenter in Poetry from Sense
and <HI>English,</HI> will make as good a Protestant Rhymer, as
a Dissenter from the Church of <HI>England</HI> a Protestant
Parson. Besides, if you encourage a young Beginner,
who knows but he may elevate his style a little, above
the vulgar Epithets of prophane, and sawcy Iack, and
Atheistick Scribler, with which he treats me, when
the fit of Enthusiasm is strong upon him: by which well-manner'd
and charitable Expressions, I was certain of
his Sect, before I knew his name. What wou'd you
have more of a man? he has damn'd me in your Cause
from <HI>Genesis</HI> to the <HI>Revelations:</HI> And has half the
Texts of both the <HI>Testaments</HI> against me, if you will
be so civil to your selves as to take him for your In|terpreter;
and not to take them for <HI>Irish</HI> Witnesses.
After all, perhaps you will tell me, that you retain'd
him onely for the opening of your Cause, and that your
main Lawyer is yet behind. Now if it so happen he
meet with no more reply than his Predecessours, you
may either conclude, that I trust to the goodness of my
Cause, or fear my Adversary, or disdain him, or what
you please, for the short on't is, 'tis indifferent to your
humble servant, whatever your Party says or thinks
of him.</P>

<L>Why do I wish to sleep, but wish in vain?</L>

<L>What cause is this that ease that rest denies?</L>

Sure I should know if Love had fixt his Dart,</L>

<L>Forget my Rebel thoughts, and let me live:</L>
<L>No need of force, I willingly obey,</L>
<L>And now unarm'd, shall prove no glorious Prey.</L>

<L>Thy gentle hands thy Mothers Doves shall Guide.</L>

And there, to make thy Glorious Pomp and State,</L>
<L>A Train of sighing Youths and Maids shall wait,</L>

<L><HI>Io Triumphe</HI> be the publick Voice.</L>
<L>Thy constant Guards, soft fancy, hope, and fear,</L>
<L>Anger and soft Caresses shall be there:</L>
<L>By these strong Guards are Men and Gods o'erthrown,</L>
<L>These Conquer for thee, Love, and these alone:</L>
<L>Thy Mother from the Sky, thy Pomp shall grace,</L>
<L>And scatter sweetest Roses in thy Face:</L>
<L>There glorious Love shall ride, profusely drest</L>
<L>With all the richest Jewels of the East:</L>
<L>Rich Gemms thy Quiver and thy Wheels infold,</L>

Then thou shalt conquer many, then thy Darts</L>
<L>Shall scatter thousand wounds on tender Hearts:</L>

<L>Thus conquering <HI>Bacchus</HI> looks in <HI>Indian</HI> Groves,</L>
<L>He drawn by Tygers, Thou by murmuring Doves.</L>

</ARGUMENT>
<L>CLose by a stream, whose flowry bank might give</L>
<L>Delight to Eyes that had no Cause to grieve,</L>
<L>The sad <HI>Sireno</HI> sate, and fed his Sheep,</L>
<L>Which now, alas! he had no Joy to keep;</L>
<L><PB N="174" REF="92">
Since his hard Fate compell'd him to depart</L>
<L>From her dear Sight, who long had Charm'd his heart.</L>
<L>Fix'd were his thoughts upon the Fatal day</L>
<L>That gave him first what this must take away;</L>
<L>Through all the Story of his Love he ran,</L>
<L>And nought forgot that might increase his pain.</L>
<L>Then with a sigh raising his heavy Eyes,</L>
<L>Th' approach of his afflicted Nymph he spies;</L>
<L>Sad as she was, she lost no usual Grace,</L>
<L>But as she pass'd seem'd to adorn the place:</L>
<L>Thither she came to take her last Farewell,</L>
<L>Her silent Look did her sad Business tell.</L>
<L>Under a Neighbouring Tree they sate 'em down,</L>
<L>Whose shade had oft preserv'd 'em from the Sun;</L>
<L>Each took the other by the willing hand,</L>
<L>Striving to speak, but could no word Command:</L>
<L>With mutual Grief both were so overcome,</L>
<L>The much they had to say had made 'em dumb.</L>
<L>There many a time they two had met before,</L>
<L>But met, alas! upon a happier score:</L>
<L>Cruel reverse of Fate, which all the Joys</L>
<L>Their mutual presence us'd to bring destroys.</L>

<HI>Sireno</HI> saw his Fatal hour draw near,</L>

<HEAD>THE
STORY of LVCRETIA
OUT OF
Ovid de Fastis. Book II.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Englished By Mr. <HI>Creech.</HI></BYLINE>
<L>NOw <HI>Tarquin</HI> the last King did Govern <HI>Rome,</HI></L>
<L>Valiant abroad 'tis true, th&ocirc; fierce at home;</L>
<L>Some Towns he won, some he did fairly beat,</L>
<L>And took the <HI>Gabbi</HI> by a mean deceit;</L>
<L>For of his Three brave Youths his youngest Son,</L>
<L>His Nature fierce, his Manners like his own,</L>
<L>His Father's Child Outright pretends a flight,</L>
<L>And came amidst the Enemies by Night;</L>
<L>They drew their Swords, Come kill me now he said,</L>
<L>My Father will rejoyce to see me dead:</L>
<L>See how his Rods my tender Entrails tore,</L>
<L>(To prove this true he had been whipt before)</L>
<L><PB N="181" REF="96">
The men grow mild, they sheath their threatning swords</L>
<L>And view his wounds, and those confirm his words:</L>
<L>Then each man weeps, and each his wrongs resents</L>
<L>And begs to side with them, and he consents.</L>
<L>Thus gull'd, the crafty Youth, and once in Trust,</L>
<L>The first occasion sought to be unjust,</L>
<L>And the unthinking <HI>Gabii</HI>'s Town betray,</L>
<L>Consults his Father for the surest way.</L>
<L>There was a Garden crown'd with fragrant Flowers,</L>
<L>A little Spring ran through the pleasant Bowers,</L>
<L>The soft retreat of <HI>Tarquin</HI>'s thinking hours.</L>
<L>There when the message came he chanc't to stand,</L>
<L>And lopt the tallest Lilies with his wand:</L>
<L>With that the Messenger return'd, and said,</L>
<L>I saw your Father crop the lofty head</L>
<L>Of each tall Flower, but not one word to you;</L>
<L>Well, says the Son, I know what I must doe,</L>
<L>And streight the Nobles kill'd; When those were gone</L>
<L>He soon betray'd the poor defenceless Town.</L>
<L>When lo (a wond'rous sight) a Serpent came,</L>
<L>And snatcht the Entrails from the dying Flame;</L>
<L><PB N="182" REF="97">
<HI>Phoebus</HI> advis'd, and thus the Answer ran</L>
<L>He that shall kiss (for so the Fates ordain)</L>
<L>His Mother first shall be the greatest man.</L>
<L>Then streight with eager haste th' unthinking Crowd</L>
<L>Their Mothers kiss't, nor understood the God.</L>
<L>But wiser <HI>Brutus,</HI> who did act the Fool,</L>
<L>Lest <HI>Tarquin</HI> should suspect his rising Soul,</L>
<L>Fell down, as if't had been a Casual fall,</L>
<L>And kiss't his Mother Earth before them all.</L>
<L>Now <HI>Ardea</HI> was besieg'd, the Town was strong,</L>
<L>The men resolv'd, and so the Leaguer long:</L>
<L>And whilst the Enemy did the War delay,</L>
<L>Dissolv'd in Ease the careless Souldiers lay,</L>
<L>And spent the vacant time in sport and play.</L>
<L>Young <HI>Tarquin</HI> doth adorn his Noble Feasts,</L>
<L>The Captains treats, and thus bespeaks his Guests;</L>
<L>Whilst we lye lingring in a tedious War,</L>
<L>And far from Conquest tired out with Care,</L>
<L>How do our Women lead their Lives at <HI>Rome?</HI></L>
<L>And are we thought on by our Wives at home?</L>
<L>Each speaks for his, each says I'll swear for mine,</L>
<L>And thus a while they talkt, grown flusht with Wine;</L>
<L><PB N="183" REF="97">
At last Young <HI>Collatine</HI> starts up and cryes,</L>
<L>What need of words, come let's believe our Eyes;</L>
<L>Away to <HI>Rome,</HI> for that's the safest Course,</L>
<L>They all agree, so each man mounts his Horse.</L>
<L>First to the Court, and there they found no Guard,</L>
<L>No Watchmen there, and all the Gates unbar'd;</L>
<L>Young <HI>Tarquin</HI>'s Wife, her hair disorder'd lay</L>
<L>And loose, was sitting there at Wine and play.</L>
<L>Thence to <HI>Lucretia</HI>'s, She a lovely Soul</L>
<L>Her Basket lay before her, and her Wooll,</L>
<L>Sate midst her Maids, and as they wrought she said,</L>
<L>Make haste, 'tis for my Lord as soon as made;</L>
<L>Yet what d'ye hear? (for you perchance may hear)</L>
<L>How long is't e'er they hope to end the War?</L>
<L>Yet let them but return; But ah, my Lord</L>
<L>Is rash, and meets all dangers with his Sword:</L>
<L>Ah when I fansie that I see him fight,</L>
<L>I swoon and almost perish with the fright.</L>
<L>Then wept, and leaving her unfinisht thread</L>
<L>Upon her bosome lean'd her lovely head.</L>
<L>All this became, gracefull her grief appears,</L>
<L>And she, chast Soul, lookt beauteous in her tears.</L>
<L><PB N="184" REF="98">
Her Face lookt well, by Natures art design'd,</L>
<L>All charming fair, and fit for such a mind.</L>
<L>I come, says <HI>Collatine,</HI> discard thy Fear,</L>
<L>At that she streight reviv'd, and oh my Dear,</L>
<L>She claspt his neck, and hung a welcome burthen there.</L>
<L>Mean while Young <HI>Tarquin</HI> gathers lustfull Fire,</L>
<L>He burns and rages with a wild Desire;</L>
<L>Her Shape, her Lilie-white, and Yellow hair,</L>
<L>Her natural Beauty, and her gracefull Air,</L>
<L>Her words, her voice, and every thing does please,</L>
<L>And all agree to heighten the disease;</L>
<L>That she was Chast doth raise his wishes higher,</L>
<L>The less his hopes, the greater his Desire.</L>
<L>But now 'twas Morning, and the warlike Train</L>
<L>Return from <HI>Rome,</HI> and take the Field again:</L>
<L>His working Powers her absent Form restore,</L>
<L>The more he minds her, still he loves the more;</L>
<L>'Twas thus she sate, thus spun, and thus was drest,</L>
<L>And thus her Locks hung dangling o'er her Breast;</L>
<L>Such was her Mein, and such each Air and Grace,</L>
<L>And such the charming figure of her Face.</L>
<L><PB N="185" REF="98">
As when a furious storm is now blown o'er</L>
<L>The Sea's still troubl'd, and the Waters roar</L>
<L>And curle upon the Winds that blew before.</L>
<L>So he th&ocirc; gone the pleasing form retains</L>
<L>The Fire her present Beauty rais'd remains;</L>
<L>He burns, and hurry'd by resistless Charms,</L>
<L>Resolves to force, or fright her to his Arms.</L>
<L>I'll venture, let whatever fates attend,</L>
<L>The daring bold have fortune for their friend;</L>
<L>By daring I the <HI>Gabii</HI> did o'ercome;</L>
<L>This said, he takes his Horse, and speeds for <HI>Rome:</HI></L>
<L>The Sun was setting when he reach't the place,</L>
<L>With more than Evening Blushes in his Face;</L>
<L>A Guest in shew, an Enemy in design</L>
<L>He reach't the stately Court of <HI>Collatine,</HI></L>
<L>And's welcom'd there, for he was nearly Kin.</L>
<L>How much are we deceiv'd? She makes a Feast,</L>
<L>And treats her Enemy as a Welcome Guest;</L>
<L>Now Supper's done, and sleep invites to Bed,</L>
<L>And all was husht, as Natures self lay dead.</L>
<L>The Lamps put out, and all for rest design'd,</L>
<L>No Fire in all the House, but in his mind:</L>
<L><PB N="186" REF="99">
He rose, and drew his Sword, with lustfull speed</L>
<L>Away he goes to chaste <HI>Lucretia</HI>'s Bed;</L>

<L>My Name is <HI>Tarquin,</HI> I that Title own,</L>
<L>The King's young Son, his best beloved Son.</L>

<L>As h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rmless Lambs, their Mothers gone away,</L>
<L>Expos'd to ravenous Wolves an easie prey.</L>
<L>Her Speech, her Courage, Voice, and Mind did fail,</L>

<L>What could she doe? ah! could she strive? with whom?</L>
<L>A Man! A Woman's easily o'ercome.</L>
<L>Should she cry out, and make Complaints of wrong,</L>
<L>His violent Sword had quickly stopt her tongue.</L>
<L>What should she strive to fly? that hope was gone,</L>
<L>Young <HI>Tarquin</HI> held her fast, and kept her down.</L>
<L>He prest her Bosome with a lustfull hand,</L>
<L>That Chast, that Charming Breast then first prophan'd.</L>
<L>The Loving Foe still sues, resolv'd to gain</L>
<L>With promise, threats, and Bribes: but all in vain&punc;</L>
<L><PB N="187" REF="99">
At last 'tis Folly to resist, he cry'd,</L>
<L>My Love will rise to Rage, if long deny'd;</L>
<L>For I'll accuse thee of unlawfull Lust,</L>
<L>Kill thee, and swear, th&ocirc; false, thy Death was Just.</L>
<L>I'll stabb a Slave, and what's the worst of harms,</L>
<L>Black Fame shall say I caught thee in his Arms.</L>
<L>This Art prevail'd, she fear'd an injur'd name,</L>
<L>And liv'd and suffer'd, to secure her Fame.</L>
<L>Why dost thou smile, Triumphant Ravisher?</L>
<L>This shamefull Victory shall cost thee dear.</L>
<L>Thy ruine pay for this thy forc't delight,</L>
<L>How great a price! a Kingdom for a Night!</L>
<L>The guilty Night was gone, the day appears,</L>
<L>She blusht, and rose, and double Mourning wears,</L>
<L>As for her onely Son, she sits in Tears.</L>
<L>And for her Father, and her Husband sends,</L>
<L>Each quickly hears the message, and attends.</L>
<L>But when they came, and saw her drown'd in Tears,</L>
<L>Amaz'd they askt the Cause, what violent Fears,</L>
<L>What real ill did wound her tender mind;</L>
<L>What Friend was dead, for whom this Grief design'd?</L>
<L><PB N="188" REF="100">
But she sate silent still, still sadly cry'd,</L>
<L>And hid her blushing Face, and wept, and sigh'd.</L>
<L>Both strive to Comfort, both lament her Fate,</L>
<L>And fear some deadly Ill, they know not what.</L>
<L>Thrice she would speak, thrice stopt, again she tryes</L>
<L>To speak her wrong, yet durst not raise her Eyes:</L>
<L>This too on <HI>Tarquin</HI>'s score, she cry'd, I place;</L>
<L>I'll speak, I'll speak, ah me! my own disgrace,</L>
<L>And what they could her modest words exprest,</L>
<L>The last remain'd, her Blushes spoke the rest.</L>
<L>Both weep, and both the forc't Offence forgive,</L>
<L>In vain you pardon me, I can't receive</L>
<L>The pity you bestow, nor can I live.</L>
<L>This said, her fatal Dagger pierc't her side,</L>
<L>And at her Father's feet she fell and dy'd.</L>
<L>Her Soul slew through the wound, and mounts above</L>
<L>As white, and Innocent as a Virgin Dove,</L>
<L>Not spotted with one thought of Lawless Love.</L>
<L>Yet as she fell, her dying thoughts contriv'd</L>
<L>The fall as modestly as she had liv'd.</L>
<L>The Father o'er the Corpse, and Husband fall,</L>
<L>And mourn, and both the common loss bewail.</L>
<L><PB N="189" REF="100">
While thus they mour'd, the generous <HI>Brutus</HI> came</L>
<L>And shew'd his Soul ill suited with his Name.</L>
<L>He graspt the Dagger reeking in her Gore,</L>
<L>And as he held it thus devoutly swore;</L>
<L>By thee, by this thy Chast and Innocent Bloud,</L>
<L>And by thy Ghost, which I'll esteem a God;</L>
<L><HI>Tarquin,</HI> and all his Race shall be expell'd,</L>
<L>My Virtue long enough hath lain conceal'd.</L>
<L>At that she rais'd her Eyes, she seem'd to bow</L>
<L>Her head, and with her Nod approv'd the Vow.</L>
<L>The Pomp appears, and as it passes by</L>
<L>The gaping Wound expos'd to publick view,</L>
<L>Fill'd all the Crowd with rage, and Justly drew</L>
<L>Curses from every Heart, and Tears from every Eye.</L>
<L>Young <HI>Brutus</HI> heads the Crowd, proclaims the wrong,</L>
<L>And tells them they endure the King too long:</L>
<L>The King's expell'd, and Consuls they create,</L>
<L>And thus the Kingdom chang'd into a State.</L>

<L>A Youth once free and happy, now a slave,</L>
<L>Found a retreat within a peacefull Cave;</L>
<L>Where no intruders durst his hours molest,</L>
<L>(But the dear Passion still inflam'd his Breast)</L>
<L>And where abandon'd to his restless pains,</L>
<L>He weeps alone, and feels his weighty Chains.</L>
<L>From thence&mdash;</L>
<L>To a dear Friend (such as are hard to find)</L>
<L>Known true and just, and longing to be kind,</L>
<L>Who always shar'd his pleasures and his pain,</L>
<L>In these sad terms writ the tormented Swain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My onely Friend, learn my unhappy Fate,</L>
<L>That I'm undone by Love, oppos'd by Hate;</L>
<L>Your pity e'er I ask I'm sure to gain,</L>
<L>But cruel <HI>Cynthia</HI>'s never must obtain.</L>

You are not ign'rant of Her charms I know,</L>
<L>Too well by Her they're known, and thence my Woe:</L>
<L>Yet must I not complain, I own the Fair</L>

<L>For I have long profanely laught at Love,</L>
<L>And oft to make the World despise it, strove.</L>

<L>Wanton till now were all the flames I knew,</L>
<L>With pleasures wing'd my minutes Gaily flew:</L>
<L>When Beauty wounded, Wine soon freed my soul,</L>
<L>My peace came swimming in the healing Bowl;</L>
<L>Or if too weak the Wine against Love's charms,</L>
<L>I took some Balmy Harlot to my Armes;</L>
<L>Which always did the rageing pains remove,</L>
<L>And cool the stings of any other Love.</L>
<L>In peace and plenty, with still new delights,</L>
<L>I past my Joyfull days, and Amorous Nights.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But now in vain that freedom lost I mourn,</L>
<L>My far fled Liberty will ne'er return;</L>
<L>Too strong's my passion, as the Nymph too Fair,</L>

In your bright Eyes such Heav'nly Beauty's shine,</L>

<L>Why shou'd your pow'rfull Charms your pride create,</L>
<L>Your pride your onely fault, my onely Fate?</L>

<L>Thus oft I've mourn'd the Conquest of Her eyes,</L>

<L>O <HI>Short,</HI> no Herb, no Salve was ever found</L>
<L>To ease a Lover's heart, or heal his wound;</L>
<L>No Medicine this prevailing Ill subdues,</L>
<L>None, but the Charms of the condoling Muse:</L>
<L>Sweet to the Sense, and easie to the Mind</L>
<L>The Cure, but hard, but very hard to find.</L>
<L>This you well know, and surely none so well,</L>
<L>Who both in Physick's sacred Art excell,</L>
<L><PB N="254" REF="133">
And in Wit's Orb among the brighest shine,</L>
<L>The Love of <HI>Phoebus,</HI> and the tunefull nine.</L>
<L>Thus sweetly sad of old, the <HI>Cyclops</HI> strove</L>
<L>To soften his uneasie hours of Love.</L>
<L>Then when hot Youth urg'd him to fierce desire,</L>
<L>And <HI>Galatea</HI>'s eyes kindled the raging sire,</L>
<L>His was no common Flame, nor could he move</L>
<L>In the old Arts, and beaten Paths of Love;</L>
<L>Nor Flowers, nor Fruits sent to oblige the Fair,</L>
<L>Nor more to please, curl'd his neglected Hair.</L>
<L>His was all Rage, all Madness; To his Mind</L>
<L>No other Cares their wonted entrance find.</L>
<L>Oft from the Feild his Flock return'd alone</L>
<L>Unheeded, unobserv'd: He on some stone,</L>
<L>Or craggy Cliff, to the deaf Winds and Sea</L>
<L>Accusing <HI>Galatea</HI>'s Cruelty;</L>
<L>Till Night from the first dawn of opening Day,</L>
<L>Consumes with inward heat, and melts away.</L>
<L>Yet then a Cure, the onely Cure he found,</L>
<L>And thus apply'd it to the bleeding Wound;</L>
<L>From a steep Rock, from whence he might survey</L>
<L>The Floud, the (Bed where his lov'd Sea-Nymph lay,)</L>
<L><PB N="255" REF="133">
His drooping head with Sorrow bent he hung,</L>
<L>And thus his griefs calm'd with his mournfull Song:</L>
<L>Fair <HI>Galatea,</HI> why is all my Pain</L>
<L>Rewarded thus? soft Love with sharp disdain?</L>
<L>Fairer than falling Snow or rising Light,</L>
<L>Soft to the touch as charming to the sight;</L>
<L>Sprightly as unyoak'd Hei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ers, on whose head</L>
<L>The tender Crescents but begin to spread;</L>
<L>Yet cruel You to harshness more encline,</L>
<L>Than unripe Grapes pluck'd from the savage Vine.</L>
<L>Soon as my heavy Eyelid's seal'd with sleep,</L>
<L>Hither you come out from the foaming deep;</L>
<L>But when Sleep leaves me, you together fly,</L>
<L>And vanish swiftly from my opening Eye,</L>
<L>Swift as young Lambs when the fierce Wolf they spy.</L>
<L>I well remember the first fatal day</L>
<L>That made my Heart your Beauty's easie prey,</L>
<L>'Twas when the Floud You, with my Mother, left,</L>
<L>Of all it's brightness, all it's Pride bereft,</L>
<L>To gather Flowers from the steep Mountains top,</L>
<L>Of the high Office proud, I led you up;</L>
<L><PB N="256" REF="134">
To Hyacinths, and Roses did you bring,</L>
<L>And shew'd you all the Treasures of the Spring.</L>
<L>But from that hour my Soul has known no rest,</L>

<L>I rage, I burn. Yet still regardless you</L>
<L>Not the least sign of melting Pity shew:</L>
<L>No; by the Gods that shall Revenge my pain!</L>
<L>No; you the more I love the more disdain.</L>
<L>Ah! Nymph, by every Grace adorn'd, I know</L>
<L>Why you despise and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ly the <HI>Cyclops</HI> so;</L>
<L>Because a shaggy Brow from side to side,</L>

<L>In Summer's heat, or Winter's sharpest cold,</L>

<L>Ah! come, to me, fair Nymph, and you shall find</L>
<L>These are the smallest Gifts for thee design'd.</L>
<L>Ah! come and leave the angry Waves to roar,</L>
<L>And break themselves against the sounding shoar.</L>
<L>How much more Pleasant would thy Slumbers be</L>
<L>In the retir'd and peacefull Cave with me?</L>

<L>Dissolv'd into Ambrosial liquor, flow.</L>
<L>Who the wild Waves, and brackish Sea could chuse,</L>
<L>And these still Shades, and these sweet Streams refuse?</L>
<L>But if you fear that I, o'er-grown with hair,</L>
<L>Without a fire defye the winter Air,</L>
<L>Know I have mighty stores of Wood, and know</L>
<L>Perpetual Fires on my bright Hearth do glow.</L>
<L>My Soul, my Life it self should burn for Thee,</L>

<L>To thee I'd Lilies, and red Poppies bear,</L>
<L>And flowers that Crown each Season of the Year.</L>
<L>But I'm resolv'd I'll learn to swim and dive</L>
<L>Of the next Stranger that does here arrive,</L>

<L>With me the sweet and pleasing Labour chuse,</L>
<L>To feed the Flock, and Milk the burthen'd Ewes,</L>
<L>To press the Cheese, and the sharp Runnet to infuse.</L>
<L>My Mother does unkindly use her Son,</L>
<L>By her neglect the <HI>Cyclops</HI> is undone;</L>

<L>That, in her Breast if any Pity lye,</L>

<L>O <HI>Cyclops, Cyclops,</HI> where's thy Reason fled?</L>

<L>New Joys, new Smiles in all their looks appear.</L>

whom he makes his tutelar God; and the better to

his Liberty: And because Slaves did not

<L>And what, no end&punc; no end of grief he cries!</L>
<L>Love, little minds all thy consuming care,</L>
<L>Or restless thoughts, they are his dayly fare.</L>
<L>Nor cruel Love with tears, nor Grass with show'rs,</L>
<L>Nor Goats with tender spro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ts, nor Bees with flow'rs</L>
<L>Are ever satisfy'd. Thus spoke the God,</L>
<L>And toucht the Shepherd with his Hazle-Rod:</L>
<L>He, sorrow slain, seem'd to revive, and said,</L>
<L>But yet <HI>Arcadians</HI> is my grief allay'd,</L>
<L>To think that in these Woods, and Hills, &amp; Plains,</L>
<L>When I am silent in the Grave, your Swains</L>
<L>Shall sing my Loves, <HI>Arcadian</HI> Swains inspir'd</L>
<L>By <HI>Phoebus;</HI> Oh! how gently shall these tir'd</L>
<L>And fainting Limbs repose in endless sleep,</L>
<L>Whilst your sweet Notes my love immortal keep!</L>
<L><PB N="90" REF="216">
Would it had pleas'd the Gods, I had been born</L>
<L>Just one of you, and taught to wind a Horn,</L>
<L>Or weild a Hook, or prune a branching Vine,</L>
<L>And known no other Love, but <HI>Phillis</HI> thine;</L>
<L>Or thine <HI>Amintas;</HI> what though both are brown,</L>
<L>So are the Nuts and Berries on the Down,</L>
<L>Amongst the Vines the Willows and the Springs,</L>
<L><HI>Phillis</HI> makes Garlands, and <HI>Amintas</HI> sings.</L>
<L>No cruel absence calls my love away,</L>
<L>Further then Bleeting Sheep can go astray,</L>
<L>Here my <HI>Licoris,</HI> here are shady Groves,</L>
<L>Here Fountains cool, and Meadows soft, our loves</L>
<L>And lives may here together wear and end:</L>
<L>O the true Joys of such a Fate and Friend!</L>
<L>I now am hurried by severe Commands,</L>
<L>Into remotest Parts, among the Bands</L>
<L>Of armed Troops; there by my foes pursu'd;</L>
<L>Here by my friends; but still by love subdu'd.</L>
<L>Thou far from home, and me, art wandring o're</L>
<L>The <HI>Alpine</HI> Snows, the farthest Western shore,</L>
<L><PB N="91" REF="216">
The frozen <HI>Rhine.</HI> When are we like to meet</L>
<L>Ah, gently, gently, least thy tender feet</L>
<L>Be cut with Ice. Cover thy lovely arms;</L>
<L>The Northern cold relents not at their charms:</L>
<L>Away I'le go into some shady Bowers,</L>
<L>And sing the Songs I made in happier hours,</L>
<L>And charm my woes. How can I better chuse,</L>
<L>Then amongst wildest Woods my self to lose,</L>
<L>And carve our Loves upon the tender Trees,</L>
<L>There they will thrive? See how my love agrees,</L>
<L>With the young Plants: look how they grow together,</L>
<L>In spight of Absence, and in spight of Weather.</L>
<L>Mean while, I'le climb that Rock, and ramble o're</L>
<L>Yon wooddy Hill; I'le chase the grizly Boar,</L>
<L>I'le find <HI>Diana</HI>'s and her Nymphs resort;</L>
<L>No Frosts, no Storms, shall slack my eager Sport.</L>
<L>Methinks I'm wandring all about the Rocks</L>
<L>And hollow sounding Woods: look how my Locks</L>
<L><PB N="92" REF="217">
Are torn with Boughs &amp; Thorns; my Shafts are gone</L>
<L>My legs are tir'd, and all my sport is done.</L>
<L>Alas! this is no cure for my Disease;</L>
<L>Nor can our toils that angry God appease.</L>
<L>Now neither Nymphs, nor Songs can please me more,</L>
<L>Nor hollow Woods, nor yet the chafed Boar:</L>
<L>No sport, no labour, can divert my grief:</L>
<L>Without <HI>Licoris</HI> there is no relief.</L>
<L>Though I should drink up <HI>Hebers</HI> Icie Streams,</L>
<L>Or <HI>Scythian</HI> Snows, yet still her fiery beams</L>
<L>Would scorch me up. Whatever we can prove,</L>
<L>Love conquers all, and we must yield to Love.</L>
