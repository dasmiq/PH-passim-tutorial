<P>_THe torrent of the Presse that now sweepes All, amongst
other Pamphlets has laid this before you. Did the
Stage enjoy 'its former lustre, this would have lien still
neglected and forgotten: but since those pastimes are
denied us wherein we saw the soule and genius of all the
world lye contracted in the litle compasse of an English
Theatre, I have thought fit amidst a number of more serious pieces to ven|ture
this in publike. You may be confident there lyes no Treason in it nor
State invective, (The common issues of this pregnant age) It is inoffensive
all, soft as the milkie dayes in was written in, for although it appeares now
so late before you like a winter blossome in the middle of a boysterous and ill|boding
season, yet this Interlude was long since the early recreation of a
Gentleman not fully Seventeene, and those times admitted but of small di|stempers,
or those yeares but little judgement to discerne them. Were all
mens Religion come up to the height once of a Drammatick Poem, We should
not feare that Stage where Virtue ever finds Reward, and Vice, Repen|tance
or a punishment.</P>

<L>Come dearest <HI>Desdonella,</HI> too long
I have practis'd Tyranny;</L>
<L>Mercy hereafter shall become my study. For
now I see</L>
<L>Our lives are but a Scene, a Scene that
changes</L>
<L>At the will and pleasure of the Author;</L>
<L>We are all but Actors and do take</L>
<L>Each severall day a severall part; This day</L>
<L>We personate a King, the next a Beggar.</L>
<L>This is our course of life which varies still,
till Death</L>
<L>The closer up of all comes in and clean</L>
<L>Puts out the Tapers, and withdraws the
Scene.</L>
