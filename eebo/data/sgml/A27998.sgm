<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE great Mischiefs which we already feel,
and the far greater yet, we justly fear from
the Vniversal Depravation of our <HI>Manners,</HI>
and horrible Contempt of <HI>Sacred</HI> and <HI>Divine</HI> Things,
have with good reason alarm'd all the <HI>Wiser part</HI> of
the <HI>Nation,</HI> who have a due Concern for the <HI>Interests</HI>
of <HI>Religion,</HI> or the <HI>Good</HI> of their <HI>Country.</HI>
Considering Men in all places express their Melancholy
Apprehensions, that if <HI>Vice</HI> and <HI>Prophaness</HI> should
without controul spread their <HI>Infection</HI> much farther,
the Consequences would be fatal; and that notwith|standing
we have by <HI>His Majesty</HI>'s unrivall'd Cou|rage,
and most prudent Conduct, surmounted our fears
of <HI>Foreign Enemies,</HI> the Nation is still in greater
Danger from our <HI>Vices</HI> and <HI>Immoralities,</HI> our more
formidable ones at Home. <HI>His Majesty</HI> therefore, to
put a <HI>stop</HI> to the <HI>progress</HI> of this <HI>dreadful Evil,</HI>
and after he has sav'd us from our <HI>Enemies,</HI> to de|liver
us from our <HI>Selves,</HI> (his last and hardest Task)
has been pleas'd to recommend from the <HI>Throne</HI> the
<HI>Suppressing</HI> of <HI>Vice</HI> and <HI>Irreligion;</HI> and our
<HI>Honourable Representatives,</HI> in nothing more
honourable than in this, have express'd a <HI>ready</HI> and
<HI>becoming Zeal</HI> for the accomplishing this <HI>Great</HI>
and <HI>Good Design.</HI></P>
<P>To think of extirpating <HI>Vice</HI> would be indeed a vain
Imagination; to suppress its growth, and reduce its
<PB REF="3">
Power and Interest, is not impossible. And tho' it must
be granted, that even this is hard to be effected, yet
when a Work is necessary, the Difficulty should only whet
the <HI>Courage,</HI> and provoke the <HI>Zeal</HI> of the Vnderta|kers.
And when our <HI>Government</HI> shall endeavour
to stop the various <HI>Sources</HI> of this <HI>Mischief,</HI> when it
shall attack with vigour the many <HI>monstrous Heads</HI>
of this <HI>Hydra,</HI> that terrible one that <HI>poisons the
Stage,</HI> and from thence conveys a <HI>deadly Contagion</HI>
through the <HI>Kingdom,</HI> may, perhaps, receive a <HI>mor|tifying
stroke.</HI> It must be confess'd, but not to the
<HI>Honour</HI> of a <HI>Christian Nation,</HI> that <HI>Poetry</HI> was
never in the worst of Times, or among the worst of
Men, employ'd to more <HI>detestable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">urposes</HI> than it
has been by the Writers of this Age. This Weapon
which might have been manag'd with great advantage
against <HI>Vice</HI> and <HI>Prophaness,</HI> they have made an
Instrument of <HI>Destruction,</HI> and plung'd it into the
Bowels of their <HI>Native Country.</HI> I will not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ay
that the worst of our <HI>Poets,</HI> no not he who in the late
<HI>loose Reigns</HI> introduc'd and establish'd that pernicious
way of Writing, which <HI>corrupted</HI> the <HI>Stage,</HI> and <HI>de|prav'd</HI>
our <HI>Manners,</HI> had this effect in view, and re|ally
design'd the <HI>fatal Consequences</HI> that attended their
<HI>performances.</HI> 'Tis hard to imagine that any Men
should be so intellectually Wicked, as to promote <HI>Im|morality</HI>
and <HI>Irreligion,</HI> meerly for the sake of doing
so; but this has been, and is still my complaint, that it
is eventually true, that the <HI>Loose</HI> and <HI>Prophane Wri|tings</HI>
of our <HI>Poets,</HI> whatever they design'd, have greatly
contributed to that decay of <HI>Vertue,</HI> and corruption of
<HI>Manners,</HI> which threaten the <HI>Nation</HI> with such dan|gerous
Consequences.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">The Regard I have for the <HI>Interests</HI> of <HI>Religi|on,</HI>
and my Zeal for the <HI>Safety</HI> and <HI>Happiness</HI> of
my <HI>Country,</HI> have extorted these <HI>Complaints</HI> from
me: And though I know 'tis impossible to escape the
<HI>Reproaches</HI> of those who will think themselves ei|ther
<HI>unjustly,</HI> or too <HI>severely</HI> censured in this
Matter; yet that is no <HI>discouragement</HI> to me. If
I can <HI>escape</HI> the Defamation of their <HI>Panegyricks,</HI>
I think my self very safe. I have no Personal Quarrel
with any of the <HI>Writers</HI> I have censur'd; and if they
think fit to <HI>expose</HI> my <HI>Name</HI> for asserting the <HI>Cause</HI>
of <HI>Vertue</HI> and <HI>Religion,</HI> I have no reason to be
displeased with them for doing me so <HI>great</HI> an <HI>Ho|nour.</HI>
If it be not possible to regulate this <HI>Grie|vance,</HI>
and reform this <HI>evil Manner</HI> of <HI>Writing,</HI>
at least I am willing that <HI>Posterity</HI> should know, if
my <HI>Writings</HI> should <HI>continue</HI> so long, that the <HI>In|terests</HI>
of <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Vertue,</HI> I mean as far as
Poetry <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s concerned in them, were not given up without
Opposition, or any Protestations enter'd against it.</P>
<P>One of the most <HI>Famous Poets</HI> of the Stage has
at last expresly own'd, that the <HI>Charge</HI> brought a|gainst
him is <HI>too just.</HI> He has done it in <HI>two Lines;</HI>
the <HI>two best</HI> he ever writ, and by which, in my Opi|nion,
he has acquir'd more <HI>true Honour</HI> than by all
the Volumes he has publish'd. The <HI>two Lines</HI>
are these:
<Q><L>What I have loosely, or prophanely writ,</L>
<L>Let them to Fires, (their due Desert) commit.</L>
<L><HI>Verses before</HI> Beauty in Distress.</L></Q></P>
<P>Though <HI>particular Persons</HI> endeavour to vindicate
themselves, yet in the general 'tis allow'd that the
<PB REF="4">
<HI>Stage</HI> requires a <HI>Reformation.</HI> The <HI>chief</HI> things
that are said in the <HI>defence</HI> of our <HI>Modern Plays,</HI>
are these; that they are an <HI>agreeable Diversion,</HI>
and that they mightily <HI>polish</HI> and <HI>improve</HI> our
<HI>Language.</HI> But of what Persons must that <HI>Audi|ence</HI>
he compos'd, who shall call that an <HI>agreeable
Diversion,</HI> where <HI>Prophaness</HI> and <HI>Immorality</HI>
are kindly treated and encouraged, and <HI>Vertue</HI> and
<HI>Wisdom</HI> exposed and put out of Countenance? Was
it not an Argument of the great <HI>Degeneracy</HI> of the
<HI>Romans,</HI> when they became <HI>delighted</HI> with the
<HI>bloody <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ntertainments</HI> of the <HI>Amphitheatre,</HI>
where the <HI>Gladi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> mangled and killed one another
for the <HI>Sport</HI> and <HI>Pastime</HI> of the cruel Spectators?
But 'tis infinitely more pardonable to be thus <HI>diver|ted,</HI>
than to make <HI>Sport</HI> with the <HI>Tragical</HI> Per|formances
of the <HI>English Theatre.</HI> 'Tis sad in|deed
that <HI>Humane Nature</HI> should at any time be so
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ar divested of all tender Passions, as that it should
be de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ighted with the <HI>Torments</HI> and <HI>dying Ago|nies</HI>
tho' of <HI>condemn'd Criminals;</HI> but for any
People to make it a <HI>Diversion</HI> to see their <HI>Religion</HI>
in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ulted, hurt, and wounded, to see Vertue it self re|ceive
such cuts and deep gashes, is a certain <HI>mark</HI> of
the most <HI>deplorable</HI> Corruption.</P>
<P>As to what is said of the <HI>Improvement</HI> of our
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">anguage</HI> by the <HI>Writers</HI> for the <HI>Stage,</HI> I believe
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">is in part true; though it must be own'd at the same
time that our most famous <HI>Masters,</HI> and most correct
<HI>Writers</HI> of <HI>English,</HI> are either of the Clergy, or else
are Gentlemen whose <HI>Stile</HI> seems to have nothing of the
<HI>Air</HI> of the <HI>Theatre</HI> in it. But suppose it were indeed
<HI>true,</HI> that we owe all the <HI>Refinements</HI> of our <HI>Lan|guage</HI>
<PB REF="4">
to the <HI>Stage,</HI> will that make amends for the
Mischiefs which are <HI>universally</HI> laid to its Charge?
Does the Honour and Happiness of a People depend
upon the <HI>Politeness</HI> of their <HI>Language,</HI> or the <HI>Pu|rity</HI>
of their <HI>Manners?</HI> let these <HI>Gentlemen</HI> re|store
the <HI>old English</HI> Vertue, but so far as 'tis im|pair'd
by them, and we'll be contented to take our <HI>old
Language</HI> in the Condition they found it.</P>
<P>There is a <HI>degree</HI> of Vertue necessary to the <HI>sup|port</HI>
of every <HI>Civil Society,</HI> without which the <HI>wi|sest</HI>
Laws, and the most <HI>prudent</HI> Provisions will be
in vain. Not many <HI>Princes</HI> have Vertue enough for
themselves, but none, no not the <HI>Best,</HI> not our <HI>Great
King</HI> himself, who has enough for <HI>many Kings,</HI> has
enough for himself, and his People too. For if the
<HI>Corruption</HI> of any <HI>Nation</HI> should encrease to that
<HI>degree,</HI> that there should not be Men of Vertue <HI>le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t</HI>
to put the <HI>Laws</HI> in Execution; if the <HI>Numbers</HI> and
<HI>Confidence</HI> of the <HI>Criminals</HI> become so <HI>great,</HI> that
they stand upon their <HI>defence, despise</HI> the Authority,
and <HI>defy</HI> the Power of the <HI>Magistrate;</HI> that <HI>Nation</HI>
for <HI>want</HI> of Vertue, let the <HI>Magistrate</HI> and <HI>Laws</HI>
be never so <HI>good,</HI> must be certainly <HI>undone.</HI> Whoever
therefore, as the Poets of the <HI>Stage</HI> have done, shall
by any means <HI>sink</HI> the <HI>Vertue,</HI> and <HI>corrupt</HI> the
<HI>Manners</HI> of the People, do effectually <HI>undermine</HI> the
<HI>Foundations,</HI> and <HI>subvert</HI> the <HI>Pillars</HI> of the <HI>Go|vernment;</HI>
for a <HI>profligate</HI> and <HI>flagitious</HI> People
will destroy themselves in spite of the <HI>best Laws</HI> and
the <HI>wisest Ministers</HI> in the World.</P>
<P>This is the <HI>ground</HI> of my Controversie with the
<HI>Stage.</HI> If a <HI>Foreign</HI> Enemy should invade the <HI>Na|tion,</HI>
every <HI>English-man</HI> should take the alarm, al|though
<PB REF="5">
he has receiv'd from them no <HI>personal</HI> Provo|cation.
The same Reason will justifie the <HI>Opposi|tion</HI>
I have made to those <HI>Poets</HI> I have at any time
<HI>condemn'd,</HI> and will plainly show that I did not do it
unprovok'd. Whoever <HI>undermines</HI> the <HI>Goverment,
provokes</HI> every Man that <HI>loves It,</HI> to <HI>resist</HI> him.</P>
<P>'Tis a great damage also to the Nation, that so
much of its <HI>finest Spirit</HI> is thus wasted, or employed
to very <HI>bad Ends.</HI> 'Tis plain that many of a <HI>Poeti|cal
Genius</HI> are likewise fit for the <HI>greatest</HI> and <HI>high|est</HI>
Employments both in <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>State;</HI> and there
are but very few, that are such <HI>meer Poets,</HI> as only
to be capable of being <HI>Turners of Verses.</HI> If there|fore
our <HI>Youth</HI> who are <HI>Poetically</HI> inclin'd, would
consider the Matter, and thereupon apply themselves
to Business, or <HI>severer</HI> Studies, many of them might
arise to <HI>eminent Stations,</HI> and at the same time <HI>ad|vance</HI>
themselves, and become very <HI>serviceable</HI> to
their Country; and by this means they would acquire
greater Honour and Reputation, than ever they will
do by their <HI>Rhimes and Plays:</HI> For if they would
reflect, they would soon be convinc'd, that tho' <HI>Poetry</HI>
is indeed an <HI>Ornament</HI> to those that have more noble
and more useful Qualities, yet when it becomes a <HI>Pro|fession,</HI>
'tis one of the meanest and lowest sort: 'Tis
like <HI>Dancing</HI> and <HI>Musick</HI> which we value in a <HI>Gen|tleman,</HI>
when a <HI>Musician</HI> or a <HI>Dancing-Master</HI>
make no <HI>considerable</HI> Figure: So greatly different
are the <HI>degrees</HI> of <HI>Esteem,</HI> which all Men pay, and
not without good reason, to the same <HI>Attainment,</HI>
when 'tis in one an <HI>Accomplishment,</HI> in another,
a <HI>Trade.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="5">And that I may not only <HI>censure</HI> the <HI>Performan|ces</HI>
of others, but likewise give a <HI>fresh</HI> Example of
a <HI>Writing</HI> that may both <HI>entertain</HI> and <HI>instruct</HI> the
<HI>Reader,</HI> I have made a <HI>third,</HI> which I intend as my
<HI>last Attempt</HI> in <HI>Poetry.</HI></P>
<P>It has been observed by <HI>great Judges,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Parrhasia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">.</NOTE>
and I find Mr. <HI>Le Clerk</HI> of the <HI>same
Opinion,</HI> that the <HI>Moderns</HI> have wholly <HI>form'd</HI>
themselves on the <HI>Models</HI> of the Ancients, and that
we have scarce any thing but the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin
Poetry</HI> in the World. We have no <HI>Originals,</HI> but
all <HI>Copiers</HI> and <HI>Transcribers</HI> of <HI>Homer, Pindar,</HI>
and <HI>Theocritus, Virgil, Horace,</HI> and <HI>Ovid.</HI>
Their <HI>Design,</HI> their <HI>Phrase,</HI> their <HI>Manner,</HI> and
even their <HI>Heathen Theology,</HI> appear in all the
<HI>Poems</HI> that have since their <HI>Time</HI> been published to
the World, especially in the <HI>Learned Languages.</HI>
'Tis therefore to be wish'd that some <HI>good Genius,
qualify'd</HI> for such an <HI>Undertaking,</HI> would break
the <HI>Ice,</HI> assert the <HI>Liberty</HI> of <HI>Poetry,</HI> and set up for
an <HI>Original</HI> in <HI>Writing</HI> in a way accommodated to
the <HI>Religion, Manners,</HI> and other <HI>Circumstances</HI>
we are now under. But however we write, I think
'tis <HI>high time</HI> to leave out our <HI>Allusions</HI> to the <HI>Pa|gan
Divinity;</HI> for how <HI>beautiful</HI> soever they might
be in in the <HI>Pagan Authors,</HI> who wrote to a People
that believ'd in those <HI>Deities,</HI> 'tis the most <HI>ridicu|lous</HI>
and <HI>senseless</HI> thing in the World for a <HI>Christian
Poet</HI> to bring in upon all <HI>Occasions</HI> the <HI>Rabble</HI> and
<HI>Riffraffe</HI> of <HI>Heathenish Gods;</HI> and yet if we re|flect
on our <HI>Modern</HI> Poems one would think we were
all <HI>Pagans</HI> to this day. What have we to do with
<HI>Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Juno, Mars</HI> and <HI>Venus,</HI> and the rest?
<PB REF="6">
We know they are a Iest, and yet they are brought
into all our most <HI>grave</HI> and <HI>chastest</HI> Poems. Solemn
Prayers are made to them by <HI>Christian Writers,</HI>
than which there cannot be a more intollerable <HI>Absur|dity.</HI>
I know 'tis said, as I have elsewhere ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">erv'd,
that the <HI>Christian Scheme</HI> of <HI>Religion</HI> is not so
well accommodated to P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">etical <HI>Writings,</HI> and there|fore
our <HI>Poets</HI> are oblig'd to embelish their <HI>Works</HI>
with the <HI>Pagan Theology:</HI> A <HI>wretched Apolo|gy!</HI>
Are our <HI>Poets</HI> then so dry and barren, have
they so little <HI>Learning,</HI> and so poor a stock of <HI>Ima|ges,</HI>
that they are not able to furnish themselves with
proper <HI>Allusions,</HI> surprizing <HI>Metaphors,</HI> and beau|tiful
<HI>Similes,</HI> without reviving the old exploded <HI>Ido|latry</HI>
of the <HI>Heathens?</HI> As in this <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Job,</HI>
they will find a Poem that is indeed an <HI>Original,</HI> and
not beholding to the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin Springs;</HI> so
they will find, if it be not depress'd by the Para|phrase,
a <HI>sublime Stile, elevated Thoughts,
magnificent Expressions</HI> where the <HI>Subject</HI> re|quires
them, and great <HI>richness</HI> and <HI>abundance</HI>
throughout the whole, without the <HI>Aids</HI> of the <HI>Pagan
System</HI> of <HI>Divinity.</HI></P>
<P>It has been generally allow'd that almost all the
<HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Job</HI> is writ in <HI>Metre;</HI> though a very lear|ned
Person, famous for his Skill in these <HI>Matters,</HI>
has assured me that this is a <HI>mistake:</HI> However that
be, 'tis universally agreed that the <HI>Subject</HI> of it is
treated in a Poetical manner; that is, the <HI>Narra|tion,</HI>
the <HI>Allusions,</HI> the <HI>Similes,</HI> and the <HI>Diction,</HI>
are such as are proper only to Poems. But 'tis a Con|troversie
among learned Men what kind of Poem it is:
Some are of <HI>Opinion</HI> that there never was any such
<PB REF="6">
Man in Being as <HI>Job,</HI> but that the Person is <HI>feign|ed,</HI>
and all the <HI>Sacred Story</HI> concerning him is made
up of <HI>Allegories</HI> and <HI>Fables,</HI> composed for the In|struction
of <HI>Mankind,</HI> like the Parabolical Relations
in the <HI>New Testament;</HI> and of this Opinion were
many of the <HI>Ancient Jews.</HI> Others believe that this
<HI>Book</HI> contains a relation of nothing but <HI>real Facts,</HI>
without <HI>feigned Incidents</HI> or <HI>Episodes;</HI> and that
therefore it is an <HI>Historical Poem,</HI> like that of <HI>Lu|can,</HI>
which contains the <HI>Narration</HI> of a <HI>Series</HI> of
<HI>real Actions</HI> in a <HI>poetical</HI> way without interposing
any <HI>feign'd Stories.</HI> Most of the <HI>Commentators</HI>
and <HI>Criticks</HI> that have writ on this <HI>Book,</HI> if not all,
are of one of these <HI>two Opinions.</HI> But I have in
Conversation met with learned Men that are of a <HI>mid|dle
Opinion;</HI> that is, that this is a <HI>Poem</HI> foun|ded
on a <HI>true History,</HI> as those of <HI>Homer</HI> probably
were: But then they say the <HI>Conduct,</HI> the <HI>Me|thod,</HI>
the <HI>Machines,</HI> the <HI>Incidents,</HI> and the <HI>Epi|sodes,</HI>
which make up a great part of the <HI>Poem,</HI>
were form'd in the Poet's <HI>Imagination,</HI> and that
therefore this <HI>Poem</HI> is of the <HI>Epick</HI> kind. As to
the <HI>first Opinion,</HI> I think the <HI>Scriptures</HI> fully con|fute
it, by asserting the <HI>Person</HI> and <HI>Patience</HI> of <HI>Job</HI>
so plainly, that it leaves no room for any tolerable
Evasion. As to the <HI>two last,</HI> many things of Weight
and Importance may be urg'd on either side; and there|fore
I shall not undertake to decide the Controversie, but
content my self in giving the <HI>Reasons</HI> that I have read
or heard offer'd to support each <HI>Assertion.</HI></P>
<P>Those of the <HI>last Opinion</HI> in the <HI>defence</HI> of it
alledge, that the <HI>Frame</HI> of the <HI>whole Book</HI> shews it
to be the Work of <HI>Imagination</HI> and <HI>Contrivance,</HI>
<PB REF="7">
and not a relation of a Series of <HI>real Actions.</HI> No
Body can believe, say they, that <HI>Satan</HI> did really ap|pear
before <HI>God,</HI> and that the <HI>Discourse</HI> recited in
the <HI>Book</HI> was indeed held between them in the Pre|sence
of the <HI>Holy Angels:</HI> 'Tis not credible that the
<HI>Messengers</HI> that brought an account to <HI>Job</HI> of so
many <HI>Sufferings</HI> that befel him, did really come upon
the heels of one another so fast, and in such a manner
as is there <HI>related.</HI> They think 'tis improbable that
<HI>Job</HI> should sit so long upon a <HI>Dunghil,</HI> and that his
<HI>Acquaintance</HI> should wait seven days and nights to|gether
without speaking a word to their <HI>sorrowful
Friend.</HI> They look on this to be a Poetical way of
representing the <HI>vast Distress</HI> that overwhelmed the
<HI>patient Sufferer.</HI> They say, 'tis incredible that all
those <HI>prolix Discourses</HI> should be actually held be|tween
<HI>Job</HI> and his <HI>Friends:</HI> and that a Man in such
<HI>sad Circumstances,</HI> as <HI>Job</HI> is supposed to be, should
speak so very long, and use so many Poetical <HI>Similes,
Metaphors,</HI> and beautiful <HI>Descriptions</HI> as are
found in his several <HI>Speeches.</HI> They urge also that
it has an Air of <HI>Contrivance</HI> to sink a Man so
suddenly from the most <HI>prosperous</HI> Condition, and to
lay him under such <HI>grievous Sufferings,</HI> and the ve|ry
<HI>extremity</HI> of <HI>Misery,</HI> and then by a no less <HI>sud|den</HI>
and <HI>surprizing Revolution,</HI> in so short a space
of time, to make him again the <HI>most happy</HI> Man
in the World. They urge that in the Catastrophe,
when this <HI>patient Man</HI> is rewarded for his <HI>inflexi|ble
Perseverance,</HI> the allotting him just the same
number of <HI>Children</HI> as he had lost, and just a double
quantity of <HI>Riches</HI> as he enjoyed before, seems too
<HI>nice</HI> to be a <HI>real Fact.</HI> The Men of this <HI>Opinion</HI>
<PB REF="7">
do not dispute the <HI>reality</HI> of the Person of <HI>Job:</HI>
They allow there was a Person of that <HI>Name,</HI> emi|nent
for his <HI>Righteousness,</HI> and famous for his <HI>Pa|tience;</HI>
for this the <HI>Scriptures</HI> expresly affirm; and
they suppose some <HI>great Poet,</HI> under the Guidance and
Assistance of <HI>Divine Inspiration,</HI> did for the In|struction
of <HI>Mankind</HI> chuse this <HI>Subject,</HI> and con|trive
the <HI>Poem</HI> upon it of which we are now discour|sing.
They affirm that this Poem of <HI>Job</HI> is of the
<HI>Epick</HI> kind, here being found all the <HI>essential</HI> parts
requir'd in the <HI>Constitution</HI> of such a Poem. They
add farther as a <HI>confirmation</HI> of their <HI>Opinion,</HI>
that though <HI>Machines,</HI> that is, the introducing of
<HI>Invisible Superiour Beings,</HI> and the interesting of
them in the Business of the Poem, are not necessary to
an <HI>Epick</HI> Poem; yet as it does greatly heighten and
embelish the <HI>Narration,</HI> they can't but take notice
that this <HI>Conduct</HI> is observed here; for the <HI>chief
Apostate Angel,</HI> and even the <HI>Divine Being him|self,</HI>
are both introduced in the most proper manner
that can be; and as this perhaps is the <HI>Original</HI> of
that sort of <HI>Writing,</HI> so it does thereby discover a
great <HI>Air</HI> of the Allegorial <HI>Epick</HI> Poetry.</P>
<P>Those on the other side argue thus: As according
to a <HI>settled Maxim</HI> of <HI>Interpreting</HI> the <HI>Scriptures,</HI>
we should not without apparent Necessity quit the <HI>plain</HI>
and <HI>literal Sense,</HI> and embrace a <HI>foreign, more
strain'd</HI> and <HI>less obvious Meaning:</HI> so without the
same necessity we should not turn the Relation of any
<HI>Fact</HI> into <HI>Invention</HI> and <HI>Allegory.</HI> And to make
it appear that there is no such <HI>reason</HI> in this Case, they
alledge that there is nothing related in this <HI>Book,</HI> but
what may well be suppos'd to have actually happened;
<PB REF="8">
that though many things appear <HI>improbable</HI> and hard|ly
<HI>credible</HI> to the <HI>Reader,</HI> this is no <HI>convincing
proof</HI> that they were not <HI>real Facts.</HI> For all Men
that are are verst in <HI>History</HI> will meet with many
wonderful and improbable <HI>Occurrences,</HI> which not|withstanding
upon <HI>sufficient Evidence</HI> they are forc'd
to believe; and they say that for that reason, because
the <HI>Facts</HI> were so <HI>extraordinary</HI> and <HI>surprizing,</HI>
they were recorded in this <HI>Book</HI> for our <HI>Ad|miration</HI>
and <HI>Instruction.</HI> They had rather give
their <HI>Assent</HI> to some things that sound only harsh and
improbable, for many such <HI>Relations</HI> are undoubted|ly
true, than by departing from the <HI>literal Sense</HI> en|courage
and embolden <HI>uncautious</HI> and <HI>wanton Wits</HI>
to break in upon the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> and turn the <HI>Histo|ry</HI>
of the <HI>Bible</HI> into <HI>Parables</HI> and <HI>Allegories;</HI> for
the Consequence of such a <HI>licentious</HI> way of <HI>inter|preting</HI>
the <HI>Scriptures</HI> they look on as very mischie|vous.
They think that the unnecessary <HI>Concessions</HI>
of some <HI>Divines</HI> in these <HI>Points</HI> tend mightily to un|settle
Men in the <HI>Principles</HI> of their <HI>Religion,</HI> and
weaken their <HI>Reverence</HI> of <HI>Divine Revelation.</HI></P>
<P>They do indeed al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ow the appearance of <HI>Satan</HI> be|fore
the <HI>Throne</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> and the <HI>Discourse</HI> on that
<HI>Occasion</HI> to be an <HI>Allegory,</HI> for there are <HI>cogent</HI>
Reasons for it; but for the rest of the <HI>relations</HI> in
the Book they see no <HI>necessity</HI> of making them <HI>Alle|gorical</HI>
also. There is the like <HI>Allegory</HI> us'd in the
<HI>History</HI> of <HI>Ahab,</HI> where 'tis said a <HI>Spirit</HI> appear'd
before the <HI>Throne</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> and offer'd to be a <HI>ly|ing
Spirit</HI> in the Mouths of <HI>Ahab</HI>'s <HI>Prophets</HI> to
perswade their <HI>Master</HI> to go down to <HI>War</HI> to <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">a|math
Gilead,</HI> and he had leave given him to do so:
<PB REF="8">
But though this be an <HI>Allegory,</HI> yet without doubt
all the rest of the <HI>Story</HI> about this <HI>Expedition</HI> of
<HI>Ahab</HI> against the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Syria</HI> was <HI>real.</HI> And to
be more particular, that <HI>Almighty God</HI> should per|mit
the <HI>great Enemy</HI> of <HI>Mankind</HI> to afflict and
persecute a <HI>great</HI> and a <HI>good Man</HI> for the <HI>proof</HI> of
his <HI>Constancy</HI> and <HI>Uprightness;</HI> and to make his
<HI>Vertues</HI> more <HI>conspicuous</HI> and <HI>exemplary,</HI> that
he should leave him for a time under this sharp and se|vere
<HI>Trial,</HI> and at last <HI>deliver</HI> the <HI>patient Sufferer,</HI>
and <HI>restore</HI> him to his former <HI>flourishing</HI> Condi|tion:
This has nothing in it but what is very agreea|ble
to the Course of <HI>Divine Providence;</HI> and if there
be any <HI>Facts</HI> in the <HI>Book,</HI> that seem improbable, 'tis
owing to the <HI>Poetical</HI> manner of representing them,
in which perhaps the <HI>Time, Order, Place,</HI> and other
<HI>Circumstances,</HI> are not so nicely observed.</P>
<P>But whether this be an <HI>Epick,</HI> or barely an <HI>Histo|rical
Poem,</HI> which I leave undecided, the <HI>Character</HI>
of <HI>Job</HI> may in my <HI>Opinion</HI> be every way proper for
the first. The <HI>Hero</HI> is indeed a <HI>passive</HI> one, and this
perhaps will be made a great <HI>Objection</HI> against this
Assertion; because <HI>Homer's</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI>'s <HI>Heroes</HI> are
very active <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ersons. For the <HI>Criticks</HI> forming their
<HI>Model</HI> of an <HI>Heroick Poem</HI> intirely upon the Ex|ample
of these <HI>two famous Writers,</HI> make <HI>great</HI>
and <HI>illustrious</HI> Actions necessary to the <HI>Hero</HI> of the
<HI>Poem,</HI> which <HI>con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">orming</HI> my self to their Precepts,
I have formerly <HI>asserted.</HI> But upon what Authority
is this imposed on the <HI>World?</HI> What <HI>Commission</HI>
had these two <HI>Poets</HI> to <HI>settle</HI> the <HI>limits</HI> and <HI>extent</HI>
of <HI>Epick Poetry,</HI> or who can prove they ever inten|ded
to do so? They wrote according to their own <HI>No|tions</HI>
<PB REF="9">
and <HI>Measures;</HI> and must all <HI>future</HI> Ages be
bound up to follow their Examples, without producing
any other <HI>Reason?</HI> Yet this <HI>Opinion,</HI> how groundless
and absurd soever it appears, some imagine, has been
the <HI>great obstruction</HI> to the <HI>Improvement</HI> of <HI>Poe|try</HI>
among the <HI>Moderns.</HI> But it may be urged that
the <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Job</HI> was written before <HI>Homer</HI> and
<HI>Virgil,</HI> and the <HI>World</HI> has as much reason to be go|verned
by this Example, as by that of the <HI>Pagan
Writers.</HI> And if we look into the Reason of the
<HI>Matter,</HI> and reflect on the End and Design
of an Epick <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">oem,</HI> which is to instruct the World in
some important <HI>Moral Truth,</HI> by the <HI>Narration</HI> of
some great and illustrious <HI>Subject-Matter,</HI> there is
no question but the <HI>relation</HI> of the Sufferings, as well
as the Actions of <HI>great Persons,</HI> are very conducive
to that end; and indeed what else is the <HI>Subject</HI> of
the <HI>Odysses?</HI> 'Tis true, the <HI>Iliad</HI> is all <HI>active,</HI> and
a very <HI>fighting Poem;</HI> but if the <HI>Odysses</HI> be consi|der'd,
'tis of another nature, there is more a great
deal of the <HI>Heroes Sufferings</HI> not evaded by Arms,
but by little <HI>Tricks</HI> and <HI>Subtilties,</HI> than there is of
Action; and yet Mr. <HI>Rapin</HI> accounts this the more
<HI>perfect Poem.</HI> In short, 'tis hard to offer any Rea|son
why the <HI>Hero</HI> of the <HI>Poem</HI> may not be as well
<HI>active</HI> as <HI>passive.</HI> If it be said, the Authority of
<HI>Homer</HI> is against it (for as for <HI>Virgil</HI> he is but a
<HI>Copier</HI> of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Model) the answer is, that the
<HI>Authority</HI> of the <HI>Book of Job</HI> is <HI>for it;</HI> and more|over
that <HI>Homer</HI> is of this <HI>Opinion</HI> in his <HI>second,</HI>
th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> against it in his <HI>first</HI> Poem. If it be said that
<HI>Reason</HI> is against it, let that <HI>Reason</HI> be produc'd;
let it be shown that the <HI>Sufferings</HI> of a <HI>great Man</HI>
<PB REF="9">
manag'd with <HI>equal Skill,</HI> will not equally serve the
Ends of <HI>Epick Poetry.</HI> As for what the <HI>Criticks</HI>
say on this Point, 'tis plain that <HI>Homer</HI> has been the
<HI>great Lawgiver</HI> to those Men; they have done <HI>little</HI>
but turn'd his <HI>Examples</HI> into <HI>Precepts;</HI> and bring|ing
no <HI>Reasons</HI> to support what they <HI>assert,</HI> they are
of no <HI>weight</HI> in this <HI>Matter. Job</HI> then is a <HI>Hero</HI>
proper for an <HI>Epick Poem,</HI> an Illustrious Person fit
to support the <HI>Dignity</HI> of that <HI>Character:</HI> He is
by the <HI>Instigation</HI> of <HI>Satan</HI> brought into miserable
<HI>Streights</HI> and unparalell'd <HI>Sufferings,</HI> to try his <HI>Con|stancy</HI>
and <HI>Integrity.</HI> He appears brave in <HI>Di|stress,</HI>
and valiant in <HI>Affliction,</HI> maintains his <HI>Ver|tue,</HI>
and with that his <HI>Character,</HI> under the most
powerful <HI>Temptations,</HI> and exasperating <HI>Provoca|tions</HI>
that the Malice of <HI>Hell</HI> could invent, and
thereby gives a most noble Example of <HI>passive Forti|tude,</HI>
a <HI>Character</HI> no way <HI>inferiour</HI> to that of the
<HI>active Hero.</HI> When the various Efforts to break this
<HI>mighty Man's</HI> Invincible <HI>Constancy</HI> prov'd ineffe|ctual,
he is at the latter end of the <HI>Poem acquitted</HI> by
<HI>God Himself,</HI> and rewarded highly for his <HI>Patience</HI>
and <HI>Perseverance;</HI> whereby the <HI>Justice</HI> of Divine
Providence is asserted, and Mankind encouraged to be
stedfast in their <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Integrity,</HI> upon a sure
<HI>Belief</HI> that <HI>Vertue</HI> will not always be neglected, but
will at last receive a suitable Reward.</P>
<P>Whatever others assert, in my <HI>Judgment</HI> the <HI>He|ro</HI>
of the <HI>Poem</HI> ought not to be drawn without some
defects; for as the representing of a perfect <HI>Idea</HI> of
<HI>Vertue,</HI> which is never to be <HI>found</HI> in any <HI>meer
Man,</HI> offends against the Establish'd Rule in <HI>Epick
Writings,</HI> which excludes all things improbable, so
<PB REF="10">
instead of promoting, it rather obstructs the End of
that <HI>Poetry:</HI> For a perfect <HI>Idea</HI> of <HI>Vertue</HI> and <HI>Ex|cellency</HI>
may amaze and dazle us; but when pro|pounded
for our <HI>Imitation,</HI> it will rather discourage,
than excite us: But when the Examples of <HI>Vertue</HI>
that are set before us, are discern'd to have a mixture
of <HI>Imperfection,</HI> we are provok'd and embolden'd to
<HI>form</HI> our selves according to such a Pattern, where
there appears no <HI>Impossibility,</HI> as there does in the
other, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">f becoming like it.</P>
<P>This <HI>Poem</HI> seems to me to abound in all kinds of
<HI>Beauties,</HI> which are admir'd in Poetical <HI>Writings.</HI> What
noble strains of Eloquence occurr in every place where
they ought to appear, especially in the <HI>latter part</HI> of
this <HI>Book?</HI> How <HI>tender</HI> and <HI>moving</HI> are the
<HI>Thoughts</HI> in the <HI>Passionate,</HI> how <HI>proper, just</HI> and
<HI>instructive</HI> in the <HI>Moral,</HI> how <HI>sublime, admira|ble</HI>
and <HI>majestick</HI> in the other Parts? What Varie|ty
is there of elegant Expression, beautiful <HI>Simili|tudes,</HI>
bold and surprizing <HI>Metaphors,</HI> natural,
strong, and lively <HI>Images</HI> and <HI>Descriptions</HI> through|out
the whole? In many of these it exceeds, and in
all of them it equals the most <HI>Celebrated Writings</HI>
of the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans.</HI> And if it should <HI>here|after</HI>
happen, that <HI>Homer</HI> or <HI>Virgil</HI> should be well
<HI>Translated</HI> into the English <HI>Language,</HI> I am very
confident that this <HI>Book,</HI> were it Translated or Para|phrased
with <HI>equal Skill,</HI> would outshine them in all
<HI>sorts of Perfection.</HI> But as to the <HI>chief</HI> End and
Design of an Epick Poem, the giving a noble and
true <HI>Idea</HI> of the <HI>Divine Being,</HI> the <HI>Justification</HI> of
his <HI>Providence,</HI> the <HI>Instruction</HI> of <HI>Mankind</HI> in
<HI>Moral Duties,</HI> and animating the <HI>Reader</HI> from pro|per
<PB REF="10">
Motives to <HI>imitate</HI> the Illustrious Examples of
<HI>Piety</HI> and <HI>Vertue</HI> set before them, in this respect,
which is infinitely the most considerable, this of <HI>Job</HI>
put all the <HI>Poems</HI> of the <HI>Heathen World</HI> out of
Countenance. How will <HI>Homer</HI>'s wretched Tribe of
<HI>Gods</HI> and <HI>Goddesses,</HI> introduc'd with all the Follies
and Vices too of <HI>corrupt Mankind</HI> appear to the
<HI>World</HI> as now instructed and inlighten'd with the
<HI>Christian Revelation?</HI> And tho' <HI>Virgil</HI> is in that,
as in other things, more judicious and cautious than
the <HI>Greek Poet,</HI> yet his <HI>Theology</HI> must be very o|dious
to a <HI>Christian Reader;</HI> and if the <HI>Machines</HI>
of these <HI>Poets</HI> in which so much of the Beauty of their
<HI>Poems</HI> consists are so contemptible and ridiculous, a
great part of their Excellency is gone.</P>
<P>There are indeed some few <HI>Moral Sentences</HI> in|terspers'd
in these <HI>Poets;</HI> but as they seem inserted
only as Embellishments of the <HI>Writing,</HI> so the <HI>Body</HI>
of the <HI>Poem</HI> carries little Instruction in it. For my
part, when I consider these <HI>Poems,</HI> I am of Mr. <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
Clerk</HI>'s Opinion, that the <HI>Authors</HI> had no|thing
else in their view than to entertain and
please the <HI>Reader,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ubi supra.</NOTE> and that all the Materials and
Contrivance were accommodated to that End. 'Tis
true, <HI>Criticks</HI> in after-Ages, a sort of Men who are
very apt to discover in <HI>Writings</HI> many notable things
that never enter'd into the <HI>Author's Thoughts,</HI>
have found out wise and instructive <HI>Morals</HI> in the
<HI>Poems</HI> before-mention'd; yet this seems an <HI>Inven|tion</HI>
of their own. For as the <HI>Learned Man</HI> be|fore-mentioned
observes, 'tis scarce possible to relate
any wonderful <HI>Action</HI> of a Great Person, or any con|siderable
<HI>Occurrence,</HI> but 'twill be very easie to draw
<PB REF="11">
some <HI>Moral Inference</HI> from it, tho' the <HI>Writer</HI> ne|ver
had it in his <HI>Imagination.</HI> And the very same
Person has with as great <HI>grounds</HI> of Probability
drawn from the <HI>Iliad</HI> and the <HI>Aencis, Morals</HI> very
different from those that are commonly mention'd, and
has offer'd sufficient <HI>Reasons</HI> to make us <HI>doubtful</HI>
whether the <HI>Morals</HI> attributed to these <HI>Poems</HI> were
ever intended by the <HI>Authors.</HI> And if this be true
of these two <HI>famous Writers,</HI> that only the pleasing
and amusing, not the instructing of <HI>Mankind</HI> was
their <HI>Design,</HI> 'tis more apparently true of the greatest
part of the <HI>Moderns,</HI> especially the <HI>Dramatick</HI>
Poets.</P>
<P>Since this <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Job,</HI> and other Poetical parts of
the <HI>Scripture,</HI> some of which I have likewise under|taken
to <HI>paraphrase,</HI> does at least equal the <HI>chief
Beauties</HI> of the <HI>Heathens,</HI> and by their Vsefulness
in their excellent <HI>Instructions</HI> infinitely excel them,
'tis a Matter of <HI>Admiration</HI> that the <HI>Christian</HI> Po|ets
should be so far enamour'd with the Pagan <HI>Wri|tings,</HI>
as to form themselves entirely by their Patterns,
to be taken up with the <HI>Study</HI> of them to the <HI>total
neglect</HI> of these <HI>inspir'd Writings.</HI> What pains and
labour have our Men been at, how great a part of
their short <HI>Lives</HI> have they <HI>spent,</HI> what a <HI>multi|tude</HI>
of <HI>Volumes</HI> have they publish'd to illustrate the
Meaning and discover the Excellencies of <HI>Greek</HI> and
<HI>Latin</HI> Poets, and to <HI>translate</HI> them into their own
<HI>Languages?</HI> If this were the <HI>Work</HI> of <HI>Gentlemen,</HI>
that had nothing else to employ themselves about, and
had no other <HI>Capacity</HI> of being useful to <HI>Mankind,</HI>
it might perhaps pass for an inoffensive <HI>Amusement,</HI>
and a pardonable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ort of <HI>Idleness.</HI> But 'tis indeed
<PB REF="11">
wonderful that to give a new <HI>Sense</HI> to an Expression in
an ancient Poet, to slop a Period more exactly, to
rectifie a <HI>Word,</HI> to give a <HI>truer Spelling</HI> to a
Man's Name, or to restore a <HI>corrupt Sentence,</HI>
should be look'd on as such a <HI>Perfection,</HI> as sets a
Man in the first <HI>Rank</HI> of <HI>Learned Men;</HI> and that
a kind of <HI>Knowledge</HI> which does not make <HI>Mankind</HI>
any ways <HI>wiser</HI> or <HI>better,</HI> should procure a <HI>mighty
Reputation,</HI> and dignifie the <HI>Owners</HI> of it with the
<HI>honourable Titles</HI> of <HI>great Criticks,</HI> and <HI>Masters</HI>
of <HI>polite Learning.</HI></P>
<P>I would not <HI>derogate</HI> from the <HI>true value</HI> of
<HI>Classical Knowledge.</HI> The <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin Po|ets</HI>
should be study'd, that we may understand those
<HI>Languages</HI> of which there is such a <HI>manifest Neces|sity:</HI>
But 'tis most <HI>evident,</HI> that for the <HI>Sense,</HI> for
the noble and sublime <HI>Thoughts,</HI> and what is more
than all other <HI>Considerations,</HI> for the <HI>forming</HI> a
Man's <HI>Mind</HI> according to the <HI>justest Ideas</HI> of <HI>Ver|tue</HI>
and <HI>true Wisdom,</HI> and thereby promoting his
Honour and his Happiness, the <HI>Poetical</HI> parts of the
<HI>Scripture</HI> have, as before suggested, an <HI>infinite ad|vantage</HI>
above all others put together, and therefore
one would think should not be less worthy of a <HI>Christi|an</HI>'s
<HI>Study</HI> and <HI>Application,</HI> than <HI>Homer</HI> and his
Followers.</P>
<P>The <HI>Language</HI> in which this <HI>Book</HI> was written is
<HI>Hebrew;</HI> and considering the very great <HI>difference</HI>
there is between the <HI>Stil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> or manner of <HI>Expression</HI> in
the <HI>Eastern</HI> and <HI>Western</HI> part of the World, their <HI>E|loquence,</HI>
as well as their <HI>Customs</HI> and <HI>Habits,</HI> be|ing
of another kind than ours, 'tis very strange that a
<HI>literal Translation</HI> of this <HI>Book</HI> as 'tis now found in
<PB REF="12">
the <HI>Bible,</HI> especially considering how long time since it
was <HI>written,</HI> how <HI>little</HI> the <HI>Language</HI> is understood,
and how much the <HI>Idiom</HI> of it is lost, should not sound
much more harsh, and be less capable of being <HI>under|stood</HI>
than it is. I am confident that if several of
the <HI>Greek Poets</HI> should be <HI>verbally translated,</HI> they
would be more <HI>obscure,</HI> if not altogether <HI>unintelligi|ble.</HI>
And if in a <HI>literal Translation</HI> the <HI>Book</HI> of
<HI>Job written</HI> in an <HI>Eastern Language</HI> does so much
affect us, and raises in our <HI>Minds</HI> such an <HI>Admira|tion</HI>
of its <HI>Beauty</HI> and <HI>Majesty,</HI> what a <HI>wonderful</HI>
and <HI>inimitable</HI> kind of <HI>Eloquence</HI> must be suppos'd
in the <HI>Original,</HI> when we can't <HI>translate verbatim</HI>
a <HI>good Poem</HI> from one <HI>Modern Language</HI> into a|nother,
tho' it be done by the nearest <HI>Neighbours,</HI>
without a mighty <HI>diminution</HI> of its <HI>Excellence?</HI></P>
<P>As to the <HI>Time</HI> when <HI>Job</HI> liv'd, it is highly proba|ble
that he was <HI>Moses</HI>'s <HI>Predecessor,</HI> or at least his
Contemporary; and that for these <HI>Reasons.</HI> This
<HI>righteous</HI> and <HI>devout Man</HI> was allow'd to offer <HI>Sa|crifices</HI>
to God, which only the <HI>Priests</HI> under the <HI>Mo|saical
Dispensation</HI> had <HI>Authority</HI> to do, and that
only <HI>before</HI> the <HI>Tabernacle</HI> or <HI>Temple.</HI> This <HI>de|vout
Person</HI> seems intirely <HI>ignorant</HI> of the <HI>Modes</HI>
of the <HI>Jewish Religion,</HI> and of their manner of ask|ing
Counsel of <HI>God</HI> either by <HI>Urim</HI> and <HI>Thummim,</HI>
or by the <HI>Prophets;</HI> and <HI>therefore</HI> 'tis evident the
<HI>Mosaical Scheme</HI> of <HI>Religion</HI> was not yet <HI>institu|ted.</HI>
In the whole <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Job</HI> there is no mention
made of the <HI>Law</HI> and the <HI>Prophets,</HI> nor of the many
<HI>Miracles</HI> wrought either in <HI>Egypt,</HI> or in the <HI>Passage</HI>
of the <HI>Children</HI> of <HI>Israel</HI> to <HI>Canaan,</HI> though nothing
could have been more <HI>pertinent</HI> and <HI>sutable</HI> to the
<PB REF="12">
<HI>Design</HI> of the <HI>Author</HI> of this <HI>Book,</HI> had <HI>Job</HI> liv'd
after that <HI>wonderful Deliverance;</HI> and there is
scarce any <HI>Writer</HI> that follow'd that <HI>Time,</HI> that does
not mention or allude to that <HI>famous History.</HI> And
this is yet farther confirm'd by the long <HI>Life</HI> of <HI>Job,</HI>
which was protracted to <HI>two hundred</HI> Years, which
agrees to the <HI>Times</HI> of the <HI>Old Patriarchs.</HI></P>
<P>As to the <HI>Land</HI> of <HI>Utz,</HI> the <HI>Country</HI> in which this
<HI>great Man</HI> liv'd, there are different <HI>Opinions,</HI> occasi|on'd
chiefly by the <HI>uncertainty</HI> which <HI>Utz</HI> it was (for
<HI>three</HI> are mention'd) from whom it receiv'd its <HI>Name.</HI>
The first <HI>Utz</HI> the Son of <HI>Aram</HI> is mention'd, <HI>Gen. 10.
23.</HI> who is reported to be the <HI>Founder</HI> of <HI>Damascus</HI>
and <HI>Trachonitis;</HI> and many <HI>Writers,</HI> for this reason,
conclude the <HI>Seat</HI> of <HI>Job</HI> to have been in the <HI>Plain</HI> of
<HI>Jordan</HI> in the <HI>Region</HI> of <HI>Trachonitis,</HI> where the
<HI>Tomb</HI> of <HI>Job</HI> is shown to <HI>Strangers</HI> at this day: O|thers
place it in the Famous <HI>Valley</HI> of <HI>Damascus.</HI></P>
<P>A second <HI>Utz,</HI> the Son of <HI>Nachor</HI> is mention'd,
<HI>Gen.</HI> 22. 21. from him the <HI>Country</HI> where he liv'd is
call'd <HI>Usitis</HI> or <HI>Ausitis,</HI> which by <HI>Ptolemy</HI> is plac'd
near <HI>Euphrates,</HI> and the City <HI>Babylon;</HI> and there|fore
many <HI>Authors</HI> believe <HI>Job</HI> had his <HI>Habitation</HI>

<P>A third <HI>Utz,</HI> who, as <HI>Spanh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">mius</HI> observes, was
a <HI>Horite</HI> of the <HI>Posterity</HI> of <HI>Sehir,</HI> and not as common|ly

their <HI>Country</HI> was after that call'd <HI>Idumea,</HI> which
has for its <HI>bounds Arabia, Canaan,</HI> and the <HI>Red
Sea,</HI> and in this <HI>Country</HI> many believe was the <HI>Ha|bitation</HI>
of <HI>Job.</HI></P>
<P>But if a Man could remove the Obstructions of
<HI>great Learning</HI> and <HI>Critical Remarks,</HI> methinks it
<PB REF="13">
should be a very easie matter to <HI>settle</HI> this <HI>controver|ted
Point.</HI> `Tis allow'd by all, that <HI>Utz</HI> the Country of
<HI>Job</HI> was expos'd to the <HI>Incursions</HI> and <HI>Depredations</HI>
of the <HI>Chaldeans;</HI> and 'tis allowed likewise that <HI>Chal|dea</HI>
was Eastward of <HI>Arabia.</HI> Now suppose that in
our <HI>English History</HI> there had been mention'd a <HI>great
Man,</HI> that had in ancient Times been plunder'd by a
<HI>Band</HI> of <HI>Scotch-men;</HI> and the Habitation or Country
of this <HI>unfortunate Man</HI> being mention'd by an obscure
or obsolete <HI>Word,</HI> a Controversie should arise in what
part of <HI>England</HI> this Man lived; would not any Man
that was derivered from the encumbrance of <HI>great Read|ing</HI>
and <HI>learned Observations,</HI> presently conclude, that
he lived in the <HI>North</HI> part of <HI>England</HI> not <HI>far</HI> from
the <HI>Borders</HI> of <HI>Scotland?</HI> And must it not have been a
Critick of extraordinary <HI>Sagacity</HI> that should have
<HI>found</HI> out his <HI>Seat</HI> in <HI>Middlesex,</HI> or at the <HI>Land</HI>'s
End? And yet those that place the Country of <HI>Job</HI> in
<HI>Idumea,</HI> or near <HI>Damascus,</HI> remove it <HI>farther</HI> from
<HI>Chaldea</HI> than those two Places <HI>before-named</HI> are
from <HI>Scotland.</HI> 'Tis not <HI>therefore</HI> to be doubted but
that the Country of <HI>Job</HI> was in the Eastern part of <HI>Ara|bia,</HI>
and 'tis probable 'twas near the River <HI>Euphrates,</HI>
and that he was of the Posterity of <HI>Nachor.</HI> The&punc;
Stories <HI>therefore</HI> of <HI>Job</HI>'s <HI>Well</HI> near <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> of
his Scpulchre in the <HI>Plain</HI> of <HI>Jordan,</HI> and of the Regi|on
in the North of <HI>Syria,</HI> which the <HI>Inhabitants</HI> shew
to <HI>Travellers</HI> for the <HI>Seat</HI> of <HI>Job,</HI> are all <HI>Modern
Fables,</HI> and not to be regarded. But much more ridi|culous
is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">rror of those Commentat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rs, who make
<HI>Constantinople</HI> to have been the Seat of <HI>Job:</HI> The
Scpulchre of <HI>Job</HI> in <HI>Armenia</HI> that <HI>favours</HI> this Opinion,
'tis very probable according to the Conjecture of several
learned Men, was erected in honour of some Captain of the
<HI>Turks</HI> of that Name.</P>
<P><PB REF="13">As to the Time when the <HI>Author</HI> of this Book liv'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc;
there are many different Opinions. Some believe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
this Book was wrote in the <HI>Time</HI> when the <HI>Israelites</HI>
were under the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Bondage, and that it was
compos'd to encourage them to a <HI>patient suffering</HI> of
their <HI>Afflictions,</HI> and to confirm them in their depen|dance
upon <HI>God</HI> for <HI>Deliverance.</HI> And those of this
Opinion believe, that either <HI>Moses</HI> himself was the <HI>Au|thor,</HI>
or at least the <HI>Translator</HI> of it; and that this was
a <HI>Tradition</HI> among the ancient <HI>Jews</HI> several <HI>Authors</HI>
testifie. Others are of Opinion, that the Writing was of
much later date, and give these Reasons for it. They
alledge that there are many <HI>Syriack</HI> and <HI>Arabick</HI>
Words, and Forms of Expression that were not in use
among the ancient <HI>Hebrew</HI> Writers, the <HI>Interpreta|tion</HI>
of which must be fetch'd from the <HI>Rabbins;</HI> that
there are many Elegancies relating to the <HI>Constellati|ons,</HI>
and several <HI>Fish</HI> and <HI>Birds</HI> which shew it to be of
a Modern <HI>Date,</HI> and from hence they conclude that it
was then <HI>wrote</HI> when these <HI>Foreign</HI> words and manners
of Expression were introduc'd into the <HI>Hebrew Lan|guage.</HI>
They believe <HI>therefore</HI> that the <HI>Author</HI>
liv'd after <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Solomon,</HI> and before <HI>Ezekiel,</HI>
because he is <HI>mention'd</HI> by that <HI>Prophet.</HI></P>
<P>Some believe that <HI>Isaiah</HI> himself was the <HI>Author,</HI>
the time when he lived being very sutable to this Conje|cture,
besides the Majesty and Sublimity of his <HI>Stile,</HI> his
singular Erudition, the <HI>similitude</HI> of Character, and ma|ny
Words, and Forms of speaking common to them both.
<HI>Grotius</HI> imagines the <HI>Author</HI> to be an <HI>Hebrew,</HI> be|cause
after the Custom of that <HI>Nation,</HI> he calls <HI>Arabia</HI>
the <HI>East,</HI> tho' others suppose he was an <HI>Idumean,</HI> be|cause
he abounds with <HI>Syriack</HI> and <HI>Arabick</HI> Words:
Whether he was the one or the other, 'tis plain the <HI>Au|thor</HI>
<PB REF="14">
was well vers'd in the <HI>Hebrew Language</HI> and
those of the Neighbouring Countries: And that in the
Writing of this Book he was under the direction and
guidance of <HI>Divine Inspiration,</HI> has been universally
acknowledged by the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Christians</HI> in all Ages.</P>
<P>But one single Reflexion prevails with me to believe
that the <HI>Author</HI> was of the oldest <HI>date;</HI> and that is,
that I cannot imagine that if he had lived <HI>after</HI> the De|liverance
of the <HI>Children</HI> of <HI>Israel</HI> from their <HI>Aegyp|tian</HI>
Bondage, and <HI>after</HI> the <HI>Institution</HI> of the <HI>Mo|saical
Scheme</HI> of Religion, he could have been so per|fectly
silent as to both. 'Tis hardly to be imagin'd that
if he had liv'd <HI>after Moses</HI> he should ever have design'd
to be so accurate and nice in <HI>relation</HI> to <HI>Time,</HI> as not
to say any thing in the whole Book but what might be
well suppos'd to have been said by one who liv'd <HI>before
Moses.</HI> This exact Care seems not agreeable to the
<HI>Writers</HI> of that Age. And if it should be suppos'd, that
an <HI>Author,</HI> that many years after took this <HI>Subject</HI> of
<HI>Job</HI> to write upon, should resolve to say <HI>nothing</HI> but
what might be fit to be said in that time when <HI>Job</HI>
liv'd; yet 'tis a great <HI>difficulty</HI> to believe that he
should be so successful, as not in any one Place, or in
any one Expression, to drop any thing that should men|tion
or allude to some <HI>Matters</HI> of <HI>Fact</HI> that happen'd
after; especially such <HI>famous</HI> ones, as the <HI>Miracles</HI>
wrought when the <HI>Israelites</HI> were brought out of <HI>Ae|gypt,</HI>
their <HI>Settlement</HI> in the <HI>Land</HI> of <HI>Canaan,</HI> and
the <HI>Rites</HI> of the <HI>Mosaical</HI> Religion. The same <HI>Rea|sons
therefore</HI> that convince me that <HI>Job</HI> himself
liv'd before, or in the <HI>Time</HI> of <HI>Moses,</HI> perswade me
to think the <HI>Author</HI> of <HI>this Poem,</HI> whoever he was,
did so too; and <HI>therefore</HI> 'tis very probable that this
of <HI>Job</HI> is the oldest <HI>Book</HI> in the <HI>World.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="14">The <HI>Argument</HI> of the <HI>Poem</HI> is this: <HI>Job,</HI> a Prince
in his Country, of distinguish'd <HI>Piety</HI> and eminent <HI>Ju|stice,</HI>
at the Entrance of the <HI>Narration,</HI> is represented
as happy as the favour of <HI>Heaven,</HI> and the affluence of
all <HI>Earthly Possessions</HI> can make him. From this <HI>pre|sent
State</HI> of <HI>Prosperity</HI> he is all on a sudden, by the
permission of <HI>Providence,</HI> for the <HI>trial</HI> of his <HI>Integri|ty,</HI>
depriv'd of his <HI>Estate,</HI> his <HI>Children,</HI> his <HI>Friends</HI>
and <HI>Health,</HI> and reduc'd to a Condition as perfectly mi|serable,
as his former had been happy. After this sur|prizing
change of his <HI>Fortune,</HI> to exasperate the <HI>bit|terness</HI>
and <HI>anguish</HI> of his <HI>Soul,</HI> his <HI>Wife,</HI> in a most
<HI>profane</HI> manner, provokes and tempts him to <HI>quit</HI> all
his <HI>Pretensions</HI> to <HI>Piety,</HI> and <HI>desperately</HI> to renounce
all his <HI>dependence</HI> upon <HI>God,</HI> and all <HI>expectations</HI>
of <HI>Deliverance</HI> from him. In this, she is <HI>imitated</HI>
by the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> and <HI>old Grecians,</HI> as well as other
<HI>Idolatrous Countries,</HI> who us'd under any <HI>great Ca|lamities</HI>
to rail <HI>bitterly</HI> at their Gods, to pull down
their <HI>Images,</HI> and drag them about the <HI>Streets,</HI> to be re|veng'd
on them for not <HI>preventing</HI> their <HI>misfortunes.</HI>
After this <HI>three Persons,</HI> eminent for their <HI>Birth,
Vertue</HI> and <HI>Wisdom, Eliphaz, Bildad</HI> and <HI>Zophar</HI>
(perhaps <HI>Elihu</HI> was with <HI>Job</HI> before) went to <HI>comfort</HI>
their distress'd Friend. Their Design was <HI>good,</HI> and
<HI>they</HI> considering that Wickedness was the <HI>meritorious</HI>
Cause of <HI>Suffering,</HI> and that <HI>Divine Justice</HI> was not
to be clear'd, if <HI>proffligate</HI> and <HI>impious</HI> Men should
go unpunish'd; and having themselves <HI>often</HI> seen as well
as heard by <HI>Tradition</HI> from their <HI>Forefathers,</HI> that
wicked <HI>Nations</HI> and <HI>Families</HI> had <HI>frequently,</HI> by the
<HI>just Judgment of God,</HI> been utterly destroy'd, concluded
that, <HI>Job</HI> notwithstanding the <HI>outward Figure</HI> he made
of a very upright and religious <HI>Person,</HI> must needs be
<PB REF="15">
<HI>guilty</HI> of some <HI>great,</HI> tho' <HI>secret</HI> Crimes: Otherwise
<HI>they</HI> could not conceive how it was <HI>consistent</HI> with <HI>Di|vine
Justice</HI> and <HI>Mercy</HI> to suffer him to be so very mi|serable.
Their <HI>Opinion</HI> was, that a <HI>good Man,</HI> such
as <HI>Job</HI> was suppos'd to be, could never be so far <HI>forsa|ken</HI>
of <HI>God,</HI> and abandon'd to such <HI>prodigious Suffe|rings.</HI>
This is the <HI>Point</HI> they labour to prove. They
press this very hard on their afflicted Friend, hoping
thereby to bring him to a Confession of his <HI>Sins,</HI> and a
<HI>sutable Repentance,</HI> upon which <HI>they</HI> believ'd, as
<HI>they often</HI> assur'd him, <HI>God</HI> would <HI>withdraw</HI> his af|flicting
<HI>hand,</HI> ease his <HI>Complaints,</HI> and restore him to
his <HI>former Prosperity.</HI> On the <HI>other</HI> hand, <HI>Job,</HI> who
was sure he was no <HI>Hypocrite,</HI> but that he was in good
earnest a <HI>Lover</HI> of <HI>God</HI> and of his <HI>Neighbour,</HI> and
was not conscious of any such <HI>conceal'd</HI> and <HI>secret
Guilt,</HI> as his <HI>Friends</HI> reproach'd him with, <HI>asserts</HI> in
his <HI>defence,</HI> that his <HI>Friends</HI> proceeded in their <HI>De|bates</HI>
on erroneous grounds: That <HI>they</HI> mistook his
<HI>Case,</HI> and the <HI>Methods</HI> of relieving him. He affirms
that neither <HI>their Notions,</HI> nor their <HI>Observations</HI>
were <HI>true.</HI> For tho' they asserted the <HI>contrary,</HI> he was
<HI>fully</HI> assur'd that God did <HI>often</HI> afflict even with the
<HI>greatest Severity</HI> many <HI>just</HI> and <HI>upright</HI> Men, and
suffer'd in the mean time the <HI>Enemies</HI> of <HI>God</HI> and
<HI>Man</HI> to live in the most flourishing <HI>Condition;</HI> and
that therefore there could be no <HI>Argument</HI> drawnfrom
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> Mans <HI>Sufferings</HI> that he was a <HI>wicked</HI> and <HI>un|righteous
Person.</HI> In some of his <HI>Debates</HI> on this
Head, he is so <HI>far transported</HI> as to <HI>censure</HI> rashly the
<HI>Divine Administration,</HI> as if <HI>God</HI> had too little re|gard
to the <HI>Piety</HI> and <HI>Righteousness</HI> of <HI>good Men,</HI>
whom he punish'd with so <HI>severe</HI> a hand, whilst he <HI>fa|vour</HI>'d
the <HI>Wicked,</HI> and prosper'd their Vndertakings;
<PB REF="15">
or at least that he made not that distinction between them
that the Iustice of <HI>Righteous Government</HI> requires.
But as to <HI>himself</HI> his <HI>Anguish</HI> and <HI>Impatience</HI> rose
to such a <HI>degree,</HI> as vented themselves in many Ex|pressions
relating to <HI>God</HI>'s <HI>Severity</HI> to him, unbecoming
an <HI>humble</HI> and <HI>patient Sufferer,</HI> which made a <HI>lear|ned
Critick</HI> say, that <HI>Job</HI> who had a <HI>good Cause,</HI>
discomposed by his <HI>Impatience</HI> manag'd it ill, as his
<HI>Friends</HI> had a <HI>bad</HI> one, but manag'd it <HI>well.</HI> Their
<HI>Debates</HI> being ended, <HI>Elihu</HI> a wise young Man that
had heard the <HI>Arguments</HI> on either side, undertakes as
<HI>Moderator</HI> to compose the Controversie, and set them
both right. He agrees with <HI>Eliphaz,</HI> and his two <HI>Com|panions,</HI>
that <HI>God</HI> was a <HI>Hater</HI> of <HI>Wickedness</HI> and
<HI>Irreligion,</HI> and that he <HI>often</HI> punished those that were
<HI>guilty</HI> of them; but then he will not allow that <HI>Job</HI>
may from thence be justly condemn'd as a wicked Man,
because a good Man may <HI>often</HI> be afflicted by <HI>God</HI>
for <HI>great</HI> and <HI>wise</HI> Ends. On the other side, tho' he does
not censure <HI>Job</HI> for his <HI>Hypocrisie,</HI> or any concealed
or secret <HI>Guilt,</HI> yet he condemns him for the <HI>Impati|ence</HI>
he express'd in his <HI>Sufferings,</HI> and for his bold
and rash Expressions that seem'd to charge <HI>God</HI> with
<HI>Injustice.</HI> After this <HI>God himself</HI> condescends to speak
and put an end to their long <HI>Debate.</HI> He condemns
<HI>Eliphaz,</HI> and his <HI>two Friends,</HI> for their <HI>unjust</HI> Cen|sures
of <HI>Job,</HI> and <HI>Job</HI> for his <HI>unjust</HI> Censures of <HI>Di|vine
Providence;</HI> but on the comparison declares that
<HI>Job</HI> had the <HI>better Cause,</HI> and had spoken <HI>better</HI> of
him than his <HI>Friends</HI> had done; perhaps that Expressi|on
of <HI>Job</HI>'s is alluded to, <HI>The Lord has given, and the
Lord has taken away, blessed be the Name of the
Lord.</HI> Then he delivers him from his <HI>great</HI> Afflictions
and restores him to his <HI>former</HI> happy <HI>Condition.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="16">'Tis <HI>evident</HI> that the <HI>Design</HI> of the <HI>Book</HI> is to
show that the <HI>Providence</HI> of <HI>God</HI> does not only guide
and over-rule the <HI>highest</HI> and most <HI>important Affairs,</HI>
The <HI>Enterprizes</HI> of aspiring <HI>Princes,</HI> and the <HI>Rise</HI>

of all the <HI>Events</HI> that happen to <HI>Mankind.</HI> By which
<HI>Impression</HI> he is dispos'd to submit <HI>himself</HI> and all his
<HI>Concernments</HI> with humble <HI>Resignation</HI> to the <HI>Al|mighty</HI>'s
<HI>Righteous</HI> and <HI>Unerring</HI> Conduct.</P>
<P>And more particularly, the <HI>Design</HI> is to justifie the

Men to live in the undisturbed <HI>Enjoyment</HI> of
all the <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Plenty</HI> their Hearts can desire,
while <HI>good</HI> and <HI>upright</HI> Men are often overwhelmed
with <HI>Poverty</HI> and <HI>Distress,</HI> and expos'd to the scorn
and outrage of their <HI>insulting</HI> Enemies. The solving
of this difficulty, which has so often puzled the <HI>Under|standing,</HI>
and discomposed the <HI>Temper</HI> of the Wisest
and Best of Men, seems to be chiefly aim'd at in this
<HI>Writing.</HI> And 'tis observable that in the <HI>Debates</HI> be|tween
<HI>Job</HI> and his <HI>Friends,</HI> when they are prest with
any difficulty concerning the <HI>Divine Administration</HI>
of Affairs, and are at a loss how to reconcile Occurren|ces
with their own <HI>Notions</HI> of Iustice and Goodness,
they fly to <HI>God</HI>'s <HI>Infinite Greatness,</HI> and seem to re|solve
the Controversie into his <HI>absolute Sovereignty,</HI>
and <HI>uncontroulable Power,</HI> which occasions many
<HI>wonderful Descriptions</HI> of <HI>God</HI>'s Majesty and Om|nip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tence.
They seem to think that when we are puzled
and confounded, and after all our Attempts can by no
<PB REF="16">
means account for the Proceedings of <HI>Divine Provi|dence,</HI>
that directly thwart our Opinions of <HI>Wisdom</HI>
and <HI>Justice,</HI> we should enter upon the <HI>Contemplation</HI>
of the <HI>Glorious Attributes</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> and consider they
so far transcend all the low <HI>created Perfections</HI> in
Man, that ours are by no means to be a measure of <HI>his.</HI>
They may and do assist us in many Instances, as <HI>faint
Representations</HI> of the <HI>Divine Excellency;</HI> but
whenever we see any Conduct of <HI>Divine Providence</HI>
that we can't reduce to our ways of <HI>Reasoning,</HI> we
should humbly adore and not dispute. We should fetch a
<HI>Solution</HI> from the <HI>Sovereignty</HI> and boundless <HI>Perfe|ctions</HI>
in <HI>God,</HI> who is always Good, and Iust, and Wise, e|ven
when in his <HI>Administration</HI> he seems to be most
the contrary. And 'tis very plain that when <HI>God</HI> be|speaks
them in the latter end of the Book, he insists on
no other <HI>Justification</HI> of his Proceedings with Men,
than his <HI>Dominion</HI> and <HI>Property,</HI> his absolute <HI>Sove|reignty,</HI>
and transcendent <HI>Greatness,</HI> that render him
unaccountable able to his <HI>Creatures</HI> for all his <HI>Actions.</HI> And
therefore in the sharpest and severest <HI>Trials,</HI> when
<HI>Providence</HI> seems vigilant and industrious, as <HI>Job</HI>
expresses it, to find occasions of afflicting, when it runs
<HI>counter</HI> to all our Desires, <HI>defeats</HI> our <HI>Hopes,</HI> and
<HI>disappoints</HI> all our <HI>Designs;</HI> in such a hard Case we
are to moderate our <HI>Passions,</HI> submit our <HI>Wills</HI> and our
<HI>Reason</HI> too, and acquiesce in this Belief, that nothing is
more certain than that <HI>God</HI> can do his <HI>Creature</HI> no
wrong, and that in all his <HI>Dispensations</HI> he has both
wise and gracious Designs, tho' our <HI>shallow</HI> and <HI>in|competent
Reason</HI> is not able to discern them.</P>
<P>'Tis probable that one <HI>Reason</HI> why we are apt to
censure <HI>God</HI>'s Proceedings is, that we take his <HI>Idea</HI>
too nicely from our selves. For tho' we must <HI>form</HI> our
<PB REF="17">
<HI>Idea</HI> of him from the <HI>Contemplation</HI> of our selves,
yet this must not be too strict, nor extended too far. For
'tis plain that <HI>God</HI>'s Knowledge is another thing from
ours; he knows by one single <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Intuition,</HI> we know
by <HI>Reasoning,</HI> that is by deducing one <HI>Proposition</HI>
from two others, and by forming in a tedious way, a long
depending Chain of Consequences, which are for that
reason apt to create a distrust. Now as our inferiour
kind of Knowledge is by no means a measure of that
most perfect kind in the <HI>Divine Understanding,</HI> so
the Iustice, Mercy and Goodness, which are the <HI>Perfe|ctions</HI>
of a <HI>Creature</HI>'s, may be of a lower kind, and
therefore an unfit measure of those <HI>Perfections</HI> in the
<HI>Divine Will.</HI> 'Tis probable that for this reason the
<HI>Disputants</HI> in this <HI>Poem,</HI> for the clearing of <HI>God</HI>'s
<HI>Justice</HI> and <HI>Goodness,</HI> betake themselves so often to the
transcendent <HI>Greatness</HI> and <HI>Excellency</HI> of the <HI>Divine
Nature,</HI> whereby they plainly intimate that we are by
no means <HI>competent Judges</HI> of his <HI>Actions.</HI></P>
<P>Another means to quiet Men's Minds concerning the
<HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Justice</HI> of <HI>God</HI>'s <HI>Dispensations</HI> in those
Instances that are the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">arshest and most unaccountable
to us, is to reflect on the narrow and broken, as well as
obscure <HI>Prospect</HI> which we have of the wide <HI>Sphere</HI> of
his <HI>Providence.</HI> Did we clearly and fully understand
how we are related to all the Parts of <HI>Mankind,</HI> both
to our <HI>Contemporaries,</HI> and to those who have liv'd in
the <HI>past,</HI> or shall live in the <HI>future Ages</HI> of the World;
had we besides a clear Knowledge of our <HI>relation</HI> to o|ther
<HI>Reasonable,</HI> but <HI>Superior Creatures,</HI> I mean
the <HI>Angels</HI> that inhabit the <HI>Immense</HI> and <HI>Glorious
Regions</HI> above us, and to those that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ill the <HI>Stars</HI> and
<HI>Planets;</HI> (for 'tis improbable this Ball of <HI>Earth,</HI> the
Dregs and Sediment of the <HI>World</HI> should be so full of
<PB REF="17">
<HI>Reasonable Beings,</HI> and the nobler Parts of the <HI>Crea|tion</HI>
should not be peopled with sutable <HI>Inhabitants)</HI>
Had we a perfect and comprehensive View of the whole
<HI>Scheme</HI> of the <HI>Divine Oeconomy</HI> in relation to all
these <HI>Parts</HI> of his <HI>Government,</HI> and how in his <HI>Ad|ministration</HI>
in the different Parts of it he promoted
the <HI>great</HI> and <HI>glorious Design</HI> of the whole, we should
have quite another <HI>Apprehension</HI> of <HI>God</HI>'s Wisdom
and Iustice. He that contemplates a <HI>Leg</HI> or an <HI>Arm</HI>
with its relation to a <HI>Humane Body,</HI> of which they
are Parts, has a very <HI>different Notion</HI> of them from
him, who considers them divided, without any dependance
on, or connexion with the Whole. It is not in our Power
to make any but partial and very lame <HI>Observations</HI> of
<HI>God</HI>'s <HI>Government</HI> of his <HI>Creatures,</HI> and upon such
imperfect <HI>Views,</HI> 'tis no wonder if our Constructions
and Conclusions are often <HI>erroneous,</HI> and this, it may
be, is another Reason why these <HI>Wise Men</HI> that ma|nage
the <HI>Debate</HI> about <HI>Providence</HI> in this <HI>Book,</HI>
lead us so often to contemplate the <HI>Works</HI> of <HI>God</HI>'s
<HI>Creation,</HI> of which our selves are so small a Part.</P>
<P>Besides this Principal and most Conspicuous Design,
other Vseful and Excellent Ends are pursu'd in this
<HI>Poem:</HI> One of which is to enlarge and raise our <HI>Con|ceptions</HI>
of the <HI>Divine Being,</HI> to give us worthy and
honourable <HI>Thoughts</HI> of his <HI>Infinite Perfections,</HI>
and <HI>form</HI> in our <HI>Minds</HI> a sutable <HI>Idea</HI> of his <HI>Great|ness.</HI>
The <HI>Representations</HI> of <HI>God's Transcendent
Excellencies,</HI> of <HI>his Independent, Sovereign</HI> and <HI>Ir|resistible
Power,</HI> as well as of his <HI>Purity, Wisdom, Ju|stice</HI>
and <HI>Beneficence,</HI> are in many Parts of this <HI>Book</HI>
so noble, so lively and admirable, that they are very capa|ble
of leaving in our <HI>Thoughts</HI> very deep and lasting
<HI>Impressions:</HI> And to give us right and just <HI>Conce|ptions</HI>
<PB REF="18">
of the <HI>Divine Nature,</HI> on which our <HI>Notions</HI>
of <HI>Religion,</HI> the <HI>Conduct</HI> of our <HI>Lives,</HI> our <HI>Ho|nour</HI>
and our <HI>Happiness</HI> depend, is to do one of the
greatest <HI>Services</HI> that can be done to <HI>Mankind.</HI></P>
<P>Another great End is to set before us for our <HI>Imi|tation</HI>
an <HI>Illustrious Example</HI> of <HI>Piety,</HI> and all
kinds of <HI>Vertue,</HI> in the most <HI>contrary</HI> Circumstances
of <HI>Life</HI> that can be, the most <HI>Flourishing,</HI> and the most
<HI>Miserable.</HI> And this is done in the <HI>Character</HI> of
<HI>Job:</HI> While he possess'd a greater <HI>Substance</HI> than any
Man in the Country where he liv'd, and was blest with
a <HI>compleat</HI> Collection of all those <HI>Enjoyments,</HI> that
are suppos'd to make a Man happy in this <HI>World,</HI> he
maintain'd his <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Integrity</HI> inviolable, he
was no less <HI>eminent</HI> for his <HI>Piety,</HI> than for his <HI>Pow|er</HI>
and <HI>Abundance.</HI> He strictly preserv'd his <HI>Mo|deration</HI>
and <HI>Humility,</HI> his <HI>Temperance</HI> and <HI>Ju|stice,</HI>
his <HI>Continence,</HI> his <HI>Compassion,</HI> and his
great <HI>Love</HI> to <HI>Mankind;</HI> as appears by the first, and
Thirty first Chapters of this <HI>Book.</HI> And when by a
strange and surprizing <HI>Revolution</HI> the <HI>Scene</HI> was
chang'd, and this <HI>Righteous Person</HI> being depriv'd of
his Children and Possessions, and afflicted with grie|vous
Pain and Sickness, became the most <HI>wretched</HI>
and <HI>unhappy Man</HI> that can be imagin'd, he then by
the Exercise of other rare <HI>Vertues,</HI> maintains as great
a Character in his <HI>Sufferings:</HI> He shows an admirable
<HI>Instance</HI> of <HI>Patience</HI> and <HI>Resignation,</HI> of <HI>Constan|cy</HI>
and <HI>Perseverance,</HI> holds <HI>fast</HI> his <HI>Religion,</HI> and
still expresses his unalterable <HI>Dependence</HI> on his <HI>God.</HI>
In short, his Mind was neither elated, nor soften'd by
the greatest <HI>Prosperity,</HI> nor sowr'd or broken by the
greatest <HI>Adversity.</HI> 'Tis true indeed that he vented
several <HI>passionate, rash,</HI> and unbecoming Expressions;
<PB REF="18">
but when we consider the <HI>Anguish</HI> of his <HI>Soul</HI> under
such <HI>prodigious Sufferings,</HI> the <HI>profane Provoca|tions</HI>
of his <HI>Wife,</HI> the exasperating <HI>Reproaches</HI> of
his mistaken <HI>Friends,</HI> who after all his heavy <HI>Losses</HI>
would have robb'd him too of his <HI>Integrity,</HI> it will not
be hard to excuse those Expressions: And no more can
be concluded from them than this, that tho' he was an
Excellent, he was not a Faultless <HI>Man. Moses,</HI> who
was honour'd with the <HI>Character</HI> of the <HI>meekest Man</HI>
on Earth, did on some provoking <HI>Occasions</HI> lose his
<HI>Temper;</HI> and <HI>Job</HI> may be allow'd to be the most <HI>pa|tient
Person</HI> in the World, tho' in such <HI>Streights</HI> and
<HI>Distress,</HI> and urg'd with such <HI>Provocations,</HI> some im|patient
<HI>Speeches</HI> might be extorted from him.</P>
<P>I cannot but observe in this place, that <HI>Job</HI> a Person
of such <HI>Piety,</HI> and so many rare and admirable <HI>Ver|tues,</HI>
had no <HI>Advantages</HI> from the <HI>Divine Revelati|ons</HI>
made to <HI>Moses</HI> and the <HI>Jewish Prophets.</HI> He was
a <HI>Stranger</HI> to their <HI>Law</HI> and their <HI>System</HI> of Reli|gion.
The <HI>Light</HI> that directed him must be only that of
Natural Reason and Conscience, assisted by some Oral
Traditions from <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Noah,</HI> and by what <HI>God</HI>
was pleas'd sometimes to communicate by <HI>Dreams</HI> and
<HI>Visions</HI> in those darker <HI>Ages</HI> of the World. By this it
appears, that great <HI>Advances</HI> may be made in <HI>Vertue</HI>
by a diligent attendance to the <HI>Dictates</HI> of our <HI>Natu|ral
Light.</HI> Would Men but improve their Reason, re|verence
their Consciences, and stand in awe of themselves,
they would become <HI>Worshippers</HI> of God, as well as
<HI>Sober</HI> and <HI>Righteous</HI> in an <HI>eminent</HI> degree. I re|fer
this to the Consideration of those <HI>Gentlemen</HI> that
do not acknowledge the <HI>Divine Authority,</HI> either of
the <HI>Mosaick,</HI> or of the <HI>Christian Institution.</HI></P>
<P>Another <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nd, and a very <HI>useful</HI> one too, is by the
<PB REF="19">
Example of <HI>Job</HI> to con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ince the <HI>Reader</HI> of the <HI>Insta|bility</HI>
of a <HI>prosperous Condition,</HI> and the <HI>great
Vicissitude</HI> of <HI>Humane Affairs,</HI> whereby his Mind
may be dispos'd to <HI>Moderation, Humility, Tem|perance,
Compassion</HI> and <HI>Charity,</HI> and preserved
from that Pride and Contempt of others, from that ar|rogant,
cruel and haughty <HI>Temper,</HI> which <HI>great
Riches</HI> and <HI>high Stations</HI> are too apt to produce,
especially in Men of a <HI>mean</HI> and <HI>low Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>I have not attempted a close <HI>Translation</HI> of this
<HI>Sacred Book,</HI> but a <HI>Paraphrase.</HI> For the <HI>Origi|nal</HI>
being written in an <HI>Eastern Language,</HI> their
Manner and Turns of <HI>Expression</HI> are, as before-men|tion'd,
so very different from ours, that I thought a
<HI>Paraphrase</HI> more proper and advantageous for a <HI>Mo|dern
European Language.</HI> But as I judg'd it would
not bear a strict <HI>Translation,</HI> so on the other hand I
have endeavour'd, that the <HI>Paraphrase</HI> should not be too
<HI>loose</HI> and <HI>wide,</HI> but that the <HI>Reader</HI> may all along
carry with him the <HI>Sense</HI> of the <HI>Original.</HI> I have
often diffus'd the <HI>Sense</HI> in other Expression. I have
amplify'd the <HI>Text</HI> in many Places that appear'd more
<HI>Poetical,</HI> and from <HI>General Heads</HI> I have descended
sometimes to <HI>Particulars,</HI> the Enumeration of which,
I believ'd, would illustrate and enliven the <HI>Original.</HI>
I have avoided the immediate Repetition of the <HI>same
Thought</HI> in Words little different from the first,
which is so very common in this <HI>Book,</HI> as well as in
that of the <HI>Psalms,</HI> and other <HI>Poetical</HI> Places of the
<HI>Scripture.</HI> For tho' this was no doubt accounted in
the <HI>Eastern Countries</HI> at that time a great <HI>Beauty</HI>
and <HI>Ornament</HI> to the <HI>Writing,</HI> yet we have quite a|nother
Taste of <HI>Eloquence,</HI> and therefore I have
thought it best to accommodate that Matter to the
<PB REF="19">
<HI>Modern</HI> way of <HI>Writing.</HI> The Method of <HI>Wri|ting</HI>
in the <HI>Eastern Countries</HI> is what the <HI>Europeans</HI>
think irregular; the same Matter treated on before
frequently recurs, and the Connexion is sometimes bro|ken,
and often obscure. The <HI>Transitions</HI> are some|times
neglected, and a new <HI>Subject</HI> enter'd upon with|out
the preparation for it which we expect should be
made. We censure these <HI>Modes</HI> and <HI>Customs</HI> in
<HI>Writings</HI> as defects, and no doubt they would censure
ours as much. I would not peremptorily condemn their
Taste, for the Opinion of <HI>Beauty</HI> and <HI>Ornament</HI>
seems not to be capable of being determin'd by any fixt
and unalterable <HI>Rule. Truth</HI> and <HI>good Sense</HI> are setled
upon Eternal and unchangeable <HI>Grounds</HI> and <HI>Reasons;</HI>
but the manner of Expression, and the method of con|veying
them, and what concerns the <HI>Dress,</HI> the <HI>Pomp</HI>
and <HI>Ornament</HI> of them, these are perhaps indifferent
Ceremonies, and every <HI>Nation</HI> may have <HI>Authority</HI>
to establish which they please. 'Tis plain the Eastern
<HI>World</HI> have not the same <HI>Apprehensions</HI> of <HI>Beau|ty</HI>
and <HI>Ornament</HI> that we have: They believe there
is a great <HI>Beauty</HI> in the <HI>neglect</HI> of what we call <HI>Or|der</HI>
and <HI>Regularity,</HI> as is evident in their <HI>Gardens</HI>
and <HI>Buildings.</HI> What we censure as careless, wild
and extravagant, strikes them with more <HI>Admiration,</HI>
and gives them greater <HI>Pleasure,</HI> than all our elabo|rate
and orderly Contrivances. All that can be said is,
that our <HI>Tasts</HI> are different, and if they are barba|rous
to us, we are so to them, some of which especially
the <HI>Chinese</HI> are, or at least have been very Wise and
Polite <HI>Nations.</HI></P>
<P>We in this part of the <HI>World</HI> are all so full of
<HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> and are so bigotted to the <HI>Greek</HI>
and <HI>Latin Sects,</HI> that we are ready to account all
<PB REF="20">
<HI>Authors Heretical</HI> that are without the <HI>Pale</HI> of the
<HI>Classicks.</HI> This seems to me to be a narrow <HI>Sectarian
Spirit,</HI> that prompts Men to impose their <HI>Fancies</HI> and
<HI>Opinions</HI> on all the <HI>World</HI> besides. Whatever high
Opinion we have of our own <HI>Attainments,</HI> we should
have that <HI>Temper</HI> and <HI>Moderation,</HI> that might pre|serve
a due regard for the <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Judgment</HI> of
other <HI>Nations;</HI> and not with the <HI>haughty Air</HI> of a
<HI>Supercilious Critick,</HI> censure and condemn every
thing that deviates from the <HI>Examples</HI> of the <HI>Greek</HI>
and <HI>Latin Authors.</HI></P>
<P>I have therefore in this <HI>Paraphrase</HI> proceeded all
along from <HI>Chapter</HI> to <HI>Chapter,</HI> and <HI>Verse</HI> to <HI>Verse,</HI>
in the Order they are set down, excepting some very <HI>few</HI>
inconsiderable <HI>Transpositions:</HI> So that I have by no
means alter'd the Method and Order of the <HI>Narration,</HI>
or any way chang'd the <HI>Model.</HI> And 'twill be hard to
give a <HI>Reason</HI> why the <HI>Author</HI> of this <HI>Book</HI> has
not as great a <HI>Right</HI> to be made the <HI>Standard</HI> where|by
to try <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> as those <HI>two Authors</HI>
have to bring this to their <HI>Tribunal.</HI> If the Know|ledge
of the <HI>Hebrew Language</HI> had been look'd on in
<HI>Europe</HI> to have been as necessary as the <HI>Greek</HI> and
<HI>Latin;</HI> had it been as great an <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Accom|plishment</HI>
for a Man to understand the first as the
last; and had there been as great a <HI>variety</HI> of <HI>Authors</HI>
of all sorts of <HI>Learning</HI> left in the <HI>Language,</HI> that
there might have been an equal <HI>Inducement</HI> to have
study'd and taught it universally in the <HI>Schools,</HI> I say
had this been, the <HI>Grammarians</HI> and <HI>Criticks</HI> might
perhaps have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ixt on this as the best <HI>Model</HI> of <HI>Poeti|cal
Writings,</HI> and have drawn their <HI>Rules</HI> and <HI>Re|marks</HI>
from the <HI>Example</HI> they found here: For 'tis
plain all their Precepts are founded on <HI>Examples,</HI>
<PB REF="20">
and on those <HI>Examples</HI> with which they were most
conversant, and in such <HI>Languages</HI> as were most in
vogue, and which most of them were oblig'd to <HI>profess</HI>
and <HI>teach.</HI></P>
<P>I have indeed supply'd in some Places the <HI>Transi|tions</HI>
and other <HI>Connexions,</HI> which according to their
manner of <HI>Writing</HI> are omitted in the <HI>Original,</HI> that
the <HI>Reader</HI> of the <HI>Paraphrase,</HI> who is unaccustomed to
that way, may not be embarrass'd or interrupted. There
are many <HI>hard</HI> and <HI>obscure Places,</HI> about the mean|ing
of which I have consulted the <HI>ablest</HI> and most <HI>fa|mous
Writers,</HI> and have taken that <HI>Sense</HI> which I
look'd on as most <HI>natural,</HI> and <HI>supported</HI> by the best
<HI>Reasons:</HI> And in this I have chiefly been obliged to
the Excellent <HI>Paraphrase</HI> of the <HI>Learned Bishop</HI> of
<HI>Ely,</HI> and the <HI>Collection</HI> of the <HI>Critici.</HI></P>
<P>I have added a <HI>Paraphrase</HI> upon several other <HI>Poe|tical</HI>
Parts of the <HI>Bible;</HI> which, in my Opinion, are
<HI>nobler</HI> Examples of the true <HI>sublime Stile,</HI> than any
can be <HI>sound</HI> in the <HI>Pagan Writers.</HI> The <HI>Images</HI>
are so strong, the <HI>Thoughts</HI> so great, the <HI>Expressi|ons</HI>
so divine, and the <HI>Figures</HI> so admirable, bold and
moving, that the wonderful manner of these <HI>Writers</HI> is
quite inimitable. One thing I must advertise the <HI>Rea|der</HI>
of, that in the <HI>Prophets</HI> 'tis common with them,
that they may <HI>represent</HI> the Certainty of their <HI>Predi|ctions</HI>
with the greater <HI>Advantage,</HI> to use the <HI>past</HI>
for the <HI>future Tense,</HI> that is, to speak of <HI>Things</HI> to
come, as already done; so that their <HI>Prophecies</HI> often
seem <HI>Historical Narrations</HI> of <HI>Matters</HI> already trans|acted:
Therefore the <HI>Reader</HI> is not to be surpriz'd,
when in the second <HI>Song</HI> of <HI>Moses</HI> he finds that <HI>great
Prophet</HI> speaking of what befel the Children of <HI>Israel</HI>
in <HI>Canaan,</HI> as things past in his own Time, which did
<PB REF="21">
not happen till long after his <HI>Death.</HI> I am of Mr. <HI>Cow|ley</HI>'s
<HI>Judgment,</HI> who in his <HI>Preface</HI> declares that
there are no more noble <HI>Subjects</HI> of <HI>Poetry</HI> to be
found than those the <HI>Scriptures</HI> furnish us withal, and
therefore I have made this <HI>Attempt.</HI> 'Tis true,
Mr. <HI>Sandys,</HI> a <HI>Gentleman</HI> of <HI>great Merit,</HI> has
done this <HI>before;</HI> but that I did not know till after I
had begun this <HI>Work,</HI> and made some <HI>Progress</HI> in it;
and when I had perus'd part of his <HI>Paraphrase,</HI> I
thought I might be able to supply some <HI>Defects,</HI> espe|cially
in relation to <HI>Perspicuity</HI> and <HI>Coherence.</HI></P>
<P>As to the <HI>Leviathan</HI> and <HI>Behemoth,</HI> mention'd in
the latter Part of this <HI>Book,</HI> I have appropriated the
Character of the <HI>first</HI> to the <HI>Crocodile,</HI> and of the
<HI>last</HI> to the <HI>Elephant.</HI> I believe the Marks enumera|ted
by the <HI>Learned Bochart,</HI> do justly determine the
<HI>Description</HI> of the <HI>Leviathan</HI> to the <HI>Crocodile;</HI>
but I can't see any necessity from what he urges, to
conclude <HI>Behemoth</HI> to be the <HI>Hippopotamus,</HI> or
<HI>River-Horse.</HI> The Character given in <HI>Job</HI> is, in my
Opinion, more sutable to the <HI>Elephant.</HI> The <HI>Rea|sons</HI>
alledg'd on both sides may be seen in the <HI>Critici</HI>
before-cited; and whether the one or the other be true,
is not a Matter of that <HI>Importance</HI> as should oblige
me to transcribe the <HI>Arguments</HI> in this Place. Per|swaded
by the Reasons of some <HI>Learned</HI> Commen|tators,
I have taken the <HI>Unicorn</HI> for the <HI>Uri</HI> or <HI>wild
Bull,</HI> and not the <HI>Oryx,</HI> or <HI>wild Goat,</HI> according
to <HI>Boshart,</HI> or the <HI>Rhinoceros,</HI> according to others.
I impose not my <HI>Opinion</HI> on others: These are <HI>Mat|ters</HI>
of <HI>small Moment,</HI> and every Man is at liberty
to think as he pleases.</P>

<LG>
<L>IN ancient Times, e'er <HI>Moses</HI> Wonders wrought,</L>
<L>And murmuring <HI>Israel</HI> back from <HI>Egypt</HI> brought,</L>
<L>A Prince of great Renown, and wide Command,</L>
<L>Whose name was <HI>Iob,</HI> dwelt in <HI>Arabia</HI>'s Land.</L>
<L>He in the Heav'nly Paths of Virtue trod,</L>
<L>And fear'd to Sin, because he fear'd his God.</L>
<L>Sev'n goodly Sons that Admiration bred,</L>
<L>And Three Fair Daughters crown'd his Nuptial Bed</L>
<L>With gracious Heav'n's peculiar Favour blest,</L>
<L>The prosp'rous Man unmeasur'd Wealth possest.</L>
<L>His Fleecy Flocks o'er all the Hills were spred,</L>
<L>And in his Stalls a Thousand Oxen fed.</L>
<L>When he decamp'd to find a new Abode,</L>
<L>Three Thousand Camels bore along the Road</L>
<L>His precious Goods, and groan'd beneath the Load.</L>
<L>No Lord was found thro' all the Spicy East,</L>
<L>Whose Herds and Stores so vastly were increast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His Sons to Feast each other did prepare</L>

<L><PB N="2" REF="22">And to their Treats their Sisters they invite,</L>
<L>To pass the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lowing hours in soft delight;</L>
<L>While Charming Music, Dances, Sports and Play,</L>

<L>Does he thy Glory, or his own promote?</L>

<L>Is it his Honour to Revere his God,</L>

<L>Still against Sin he makes a brave defence,</L>
<L>Despoil'd of all things, but his Innocence.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Th' Apostate then reply'd. Mankind, 'tis known,</L>
<L>Will give their Childrens Skins, to save their own.</L>
<L>To save their Lives, their Treasures they produce;</L>

<L>In haste th' Apostate on this Errand went,</L>

<L>Unhappy Man as soon as Born decays,</L>
<L>He numbers few, and those uneasy Days.</L>
<L>As in a verdant Mead a blowing Flower,</L>
<L>The suddain Offspring of a Summer Shower,</L>

<L>But is e'er Evening Cut, or fades away:</L>

<L>And wilt thou Man regard, and condescend</L>

<L>I therefore can't a faultless Life protest,</L>

<L>Unclean I am, but not above the Rest.</L>
<L>This is the thing I humbly would demand,</L>

<L>For Truth to you her Secrets will reveal.</L>
<L>As by the Palate various Meats are try'd,</L>
<L>So does the Mind what's true or false decide.</L>
<L>Let us a strict Examination make,</L>

<L>Let us the matter carefully debate,</L>
<L>Let us the weighty Subject justly state.</L>

<L>Evasions I'll not use in my Defence,</L>

<L>A Man, like <HI>Iob,</HI> say, have you ever known</L>
<L>So Arrogant, and so Licentious grown?</L>
<L>One, who instead of honouring his God,</L>
<L>And humbly suff'ring his Chastising Rod,</L>
<L>Justice Divine presumptuously arralgns,</L>

<L>Ye Wise, to whom I first my self addrest,</L>

<L>Whose Frowns should him incline to be unjust?</L>
<L>He that with all Perfections does abound,</L>

<L>His Mind without a Stain shines pure and bright,</L>
<L>No Spot appears in uncreated Light.</L>

<L>A formidable Troop, came howling in the Reer.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Th' Almighty on the Frontiers made a stand</L>
<L>To measure out the promis'd Land.</L>
<L>He did distinctly circumscribe</L>
<L>Th' Inheritance of every Tribe.</L>
<L>That done the Nations he asunder drove,</L>
<L>And march'd the Lords of <HI>Canaan</HI> to remove.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His swift-wing'd Whirlwinds onward flew,</L>
<L>And o'er the Hills his Chariot drew;</L>
<L>Whose awful Wheels roll'd on in Clouds and Smoke,</L>
<L>Whence Flakes of Fire and flashing Lightnings broke.</L>
<L>Such Bolts were cast, such Thunder claps did roar,</L>
<L>As shook the Rocks which never shook before.</L>
<L>The shudd'ring Hills exprest their dread</L>
<L>And everlasting Mountains bow'd their aged Head.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When <HI>Isr'el</HI> march'd o'er dry <HI>Arabia</HI>'s Sand,</L>
<L>By <HI>Moses</HI> led to <HI>Canaan</HI>'s Land,</L>
<L>How were the States on either side</L>
<L>At their approach alarm'd and terrify'd?</L>
<L>How did the Tents of <HI>Cushan</HI> shake?</L>
<L>How did the Kings of <HI>Midian</HI> quake?</L>
<L>How did they dread the Fame of <HI>Isr'el</HI>'s God,</L>
<L>And his great Gen'ral's wonder-working Rod?</L>
<L><PB N="287" REF="164">That Rod which turn'd to Crystal Walls the Flood,</L>
<L>Its Virtue still retains,</L>
<L>And in the trembling Heathens Veins</L>
<L>Chills and congeals their Vital Streams of Blood&punc;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Did e'er the Rivers God displease?</L>
<L>Or did his Anger rise against the Seas,</L>
<L>That he their Waters did divide,</L>
<L>And roll'd them up on Heaps on either side,</L>
<L>When he prepar'd his warlike Equipage</L>
<L>His Chariots and his Horse King <HI>Pharoah</HI> to engage?</L>
<L>No, those amazing Miracles were shown</L>
<L>To make his kindness to his People known.</L>
<L>His Chariots and his Horsemen brought</L>
<L>Salvation to the Tribes, for whom he fought.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He did his fatal Bow prepare,</L>
<L>And all his dreadful Instruments of War,</L>
<L>Which put the Pagan Lords to flight</L>
<L>And from their Country chas'd the Cananite.</L>
<L>Thus to his Promise God was true</L>
<L>Which to the Tribes he did so oft renew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As <HI>Israel</HI>'s Host advanc'd to <HI>Canaan</HI>'s Land,</L>
<L>Opprest with drought amidst the Sand.</L>
<L>Refreshing Streams were in the Desart found,</L>
<L>And bubbling Springs broke from the thirsty Ground.</L>
<L>Instead of Fire th' Almighty struck</L>
<L>Fresh Water from the Flinty Rock.</L>
<L><PB N="288" REF="165">When God in Triumph did appear,</L>
<L>The lofty Mountains shook for fear.</L>
<L><HI>Iordan</HI> held back his cleaving Flood</L>
<L>And high in Craggy Heaps the Crystal Waters stood.</L>
<L>Bare and defrauded of its Tyde,</L>
<L>The sandy Chanel lay from side to side;</L>
<L>This Passage for the Tribes th' Almighty did provide.</L>
<L>Th' obsequious Deep did raise its roaring Voice</L>
<L>And split asunder with prodigious noise</L>
<L>It shew'd as if by lifting up the Hand</L>
<L>It's Readiness t' obey the high Command.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At God's command the restless Sun</L>
<L>That as a Gyant loves his Course to run,</L>
<L>Did in his full Carreer his Chariot stay</L>
<L>On Heav'ns Descent, and stopt the falling Day.</L>
<L>Progressive Time was at a stand,</L>
<L>His drooping Wings unable to expand.</L>
<L>The Constellations, and th' astonish'd Moon,</L>
<L>Halted to gaze upon the standing Sun.</L>
<L>So long its ling'ring Orb its Light did lend</L>
<L>As <HI>Ioshuah</HI>'s Troops had Spears to spend;</L>
<L>As long as they had Darts to cast away,</L>
<L>Or there remain'd a Foe to slay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In Indignation God thro' <HI>Canaan</HI> past,</L>
<L>And with his terrible alarms</L>
<L>And Conq'ring Arms</L>
<L>He chas'd the Kings, and laid the Nations wast.</L>
<L><PB N="289" REF="165"><HI>Isr'els</HI> Salvation to compleat</L>
<L>He onward march'd the Heathen to defeat.</L>
<L>To save his People and to crown</L>
<L>Great <HI>Iosua</HI>'s Arms with Triumph and Renown,</L>
<L>To <HI>Canaan</HI>'s Kings he gave a deadly Wound</L>
<L>And did their Friends and Familys confound.</L>
<L>He overthrew their Palaces</L>
<L>Th' Imperial Seats of Pride and Wickedness.</L>
<L>He broke the Pillars that sustain'd their weight,</L>
<L>And raz'd the strong Foundations of their State.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>God did by <HI>Isr'el</HI>'s Arms subdue</L>
<L>Their Towns and all their Villages o'erthrew.</L>
<L>Tho' at the first the Nations round arose</L>
<L>And like a Tempest did our March oppose,</L>
<L>They onward came with Shouts of Joy</L>
<L>As sure the Tribes they should destroy:</L>
<L>They did our Army so much slight</L>
<L>They thought they came to Plunder, not to fight.</L>
<L>O <HI>Israel,</HI> in despight of these alarms,</L>
<L>In spite of all their Plots and Arms:</L>
<L>Thou with thy Conq'ring Sword didst make thy way,</L>
<L>From <HI>Iordan</HI>'s Flood to the great Western Sea.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus for the Tribes th' Almighty did appear,</L>
<L>Once to their God his People were so dear.</L>
<L>But now he threatens to employ</L>
<L><HI>Assyrian</HI> Arms his People to destroy.</L>
<L>For this my Blood hangs curdled in my Veins,</L>
<L>And strong Convulsions rend my tortur'd Reins</L>
<L><PB N="290" REF="166">My Bones all rattle in their rocking Frame,</L>
<L>And in my Heart Fear damps the Vital Flame.</L>
<L>Horror my Spirits does possess,</L>
<L>Nor can my quiv'ring Lips one perfect word express.</L>
<L>I Tremble now, and Weep and Mourn,</L>
<L>That when the sad amazing Turn</L>
<L>Shall happen, and the gloomy Day</L>
<L>Of Vengeance all its Terrors shall display;</L>
<L>Safe from the Tempest I may find,</L>
<L>Peace in my House, and Comfort in my Mind.</L>
<L>I'll to th' Almighty's Mercy fly</L>
<L>And on his faithful Providence rely,</L>
<L>When <HI>Babylon</HI>'s insulting King</L>
<L>Shall all his fierce and numerous Armys bring,</L>
<L>Armys to Blood and Rapine bred,</L>
<L>To pull down <HI>Isr'el</HI>'s lofty Head,</L>
<L>And dreadful Desolation o'er our Citys spread</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And then tho' Famine should invade,</L>
<L>Tho' Plants and Flow'rs and Fruits should fade;</L>
<L>Tho' on the Vine no Clusters should appear,</L>
<L>And tho' the Fig-tree should no Blossoms bear;</L>
<L>Tho' th' Olive yields not to the Dresser Oyl,</L>
<L>And barren Fields defeat the Farmer's toyl;</L>
<L>Tho' the high Folds no bleating Flocks surround,</L>
<L>And in the Stalls no lowing Heards are found;</L>
<L>Yet I'll rejoyce in God my sure defence,</L>
<L>And in his Strength repose my Confidence.</L>
<L><PB N="291" REF="166">Still will I trust him still I will believe,</L>
<L>That he will <HI>Isr'el</HI>'s Captive State retrieve:</L>
