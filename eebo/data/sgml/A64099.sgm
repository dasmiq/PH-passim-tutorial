<HEAD>To the Right Honourable and most truly Noble RICHARD Lord VAVGHAN, Earl of CARBERY, Baron of EMLIN, and MOLIN|GAR; Knight of the Ho|nourable Order of the BATH.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Am treating your Lordship as a Ro|man Gentleman did Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> and his Mother; I shall entertain you in a Charnel house,
<PB REF="10">
and carry your meditations a|while into the chambers of death, where you shall finde the rooms dressed up with melancholy arts, and fit to converse with your most retired thoughts, which begin with a sigh and proceed in deep consideration, and end in a holy resolution. The sight that S. <HI>Au|gustine</HI> most noted in that house of sorrow was the body of <HI>Caesar</HI> clothed with all the dishonours of corruption, that you can sup|pose in a six moneths burial. But I know that without pointing, your first thoughts will remem|ber the change of a greater beau|ty, which is now dressing for the brightest immortality; and from her bed of darknesse calls to you to dress your soul for that change which shall mingle your bones with that beloved dust, and carry your soul to the same Quire, where you may both sit and sing
<PB REF="10">
for ever. My Lord it is your dear Ladies <HI>Anniversary,</HI> and she de|served the <HI>biggest honour,</HI> and the <HI>longest memory,</HI> and the <HI>fairest monument,</HI> and the most <HI>solemne mourning</HI>; and in order to it give me leave (My Lord) to cover her Hearse with these following sheets; this book was intended first to minister to her piety; and she desired all good people should partake of the advantages which are here recorded: she knew how to live rarely well, and she desired to know how to dye; and God taught her by an experi|ment. But since her work is done and God supplyed her with pro|visions of his own, before I could minister to her, and perfect what she desired, it is necessary to present to your Lordship those bundles of Cypresse which were intended to dresse her Closet, but come now to dresse her Hearse.
<PB REF="11">
(My Lord) both your Lordship and my self have lately seen and felt such sorrows of death, and such sad departure of Dearest friends, that it is more then high time we should think our selves neerly concerned in the accidents; Death hath come so neer to you as to fetch a portion from your very heart; and now you can|not choose but digge your own grave and place your coffin in your eye when the Angel hath dressed your scene of sorrow and meditation with so particular and so neer an object; and therefore as it is my duty, I am come to mi|nister to your pious thoughts, and to direct your sorrows that they may turn into vertues and advantages.</P>
<P>And since I know your Lord|ship to be so constant and regular in your devotions, and so tender in the matter of justice, so ready
<PB REF="11">
in the expressions of charity and so apprehensive of religion, and that you are a person whose work of grace is apt, and must every day grow towards those degrees, where when you arrive you shall triumph over imperfection, and choose nothing but what may please God, I could not by any compendium conduct and assist your pious purposes so well as by that which is the great argu|ment and the great instrument of holy living, the consideration and exercises of death.</P>
<P>My Lord, it is a great art to dye well, and to be learnt by men in health, by them that can discourse and consider; by those whose understanding, and acts of reason are not abated with fear or pains, and as the greatest part of death is passed by the preceding years of our life, so also in those
<PB REF="12">
years are the greatest preparation to it: and he that prepares not for death, before his last sicknesse, is like him that begins to study Philosophy when he is going to dispute publikely in the faculty. All that a sick and dying man can do is but to exercise those ver|tues, which he before acquired, and to perfect that repentance which was begun more early. And of this (My Lord) my Book I think is a good testimony, not onely because it represents the vanity of a late and sick-bed re|pentance, but because it contains in it so many precepts and medi|tations, so many propositions and various duties, such forms of ex|ercise, and the degrees and diffi|culties of so many graces which are necessary preparatives to a holy death, that the very learn|ing the duties require study and skill, time and understanding in
<PB REF="12">
the wayes of godlinesse; and it were very vain, to say so much is necessary, and not to suppose more time to learn them, more skill to practise them, more op|portunities to desire them, more abilities both of body and mind then can be supposed in a sick, amazed, timerous, and weak per|son; whose naturall acts are dis|abled, whose senses are weak, whose discerning faculties are lessened, whose principles are made intricate and intangled, up|on whose eye sits a cloud, and the heart is broken with sicknesse, and the liver pierced thorow with sorrows and the strokes of death. And therefore (my Lord) it is intended by the necessity of affairs, that the precepts of <HI>dying well</HI> be part of the studies of them that live in health, and the dayes of discourse and understanding: which in this case hath another
<PB REF="13">
degree of necessity superadded; because in other notices, an im|perfect study may be supplied by a frequent exercise, and a renew|ed experience: Here, if we pra|ctise imperfectly once, we shall never recover the errour: for we die but once; and therefore it will be necessary that our skill be more exact, since it is not to be mended by triall, but the actions must be for ever left imperfect, unlesse the habit be contracted with study and contemplation before hand.</P>
<P>And indeed I were vain, if I should intend this book to be read and studied by dying persons: and they were vainer that should need to be instructed in those graces which they are then to exercise and to finish. For a sick bed is on|ly a school of severe exercise, in which the spirit of a man is tried, and his graces are rehearsed: and
<PB REF="13">
the assistances which I have in the following pages given to those vertues which are proper to the state of sicknesse, are such as sup|pose a man in the state of grace; or they confirm a good man, or they support the weak, or adde degrees, or minister comfort, or prevent an evil, or cure the little mischiefs which are incident to tempted persons in their weak|nesse; this is the summe of the present designe, as it relates to dy|ing persons. And therefore I have not inserted any advices proper to old age, but such as are com|mon to it and the state of sick|nesse; for I suppose <HI>very old age</HI> to be <HI>a longer sicknesse,</HI> it is la|bour and sorrow when it goes be|yond the common period of na|ture; but if it be on this side that period, and be healthfull, in the same degree it is so, I reckon it in the accounts of life; and there|fore
<PB REF="14">
it can have no distinct consi|deration. But I do not think it is a station of advantage to begin the change of an evil life in: It is a middle state between <HI>life</HI> and <HI>death-bed,</HI> and therefore although it hath more of hopes, then <HI>this,</HI> and lesse then <HI>that,</HI> yet as it par|takes of either state: so it is to be regulated by the advices of that state, and judged by its senten|ces.</P>
<P>Onely this: I desire, that all old persons would sadly consider that their advantages in that state are very few, but their inconve|niences are not few: Their bo|dies are without strength, their prejudices long and mighty, their vices (if they have lived wicked|ly) are habituall, the occasions of their vertues not many, the pos|sibilities of some (in the matter of which they stand very guilty) are past, and shall never return
<PB REF="14">
again (such are, chastity, and many parts of self-deniall;) that they have some temptations pro|per to their age, as peevishnesse, and pride, covetousnesse, and talking, wilfulnesse and unwil|lingnesse to <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><L>Vel quia nil rectum nisi quod placuit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ibi ducunt,</L>
<L>Vel quia turpe putant parere mino<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ibus, &amp; quae</L>
<L>Imberbes didicere, senes per|denda fateri.</L></NOTE> learn, and they think they are protected by age from learning anew, or repenting the old; and do not <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Tenellis adhuc infantiae suae persuasionibus in senectute puerascunt Mamertus.</NOTE> leave, but change their vices: And af|ter all this, either the day of their repentance is past, as we see it true in very many, or it is expi|ring and towards the Sun-set, as it is in all; and therefore although in these, to recover is very possi|ble, yet we may also remember that in the matter of vertue and repentance, <HI>possibility</HI> is a great way off from performance; and how few do repent, of whom it
<PB REF="15">
is onely <HI>possible</HI> that they may; and that many things more are required to reduce their possibi|lity to act: a great grace, an assi|duous ministery, an effective cal|ling, mighty assistances, excellent counsell, great industry, a watch|full diligence, a well disposed mind, passionate desires, deep apprehensions of danger, quick perceptions of duty, and time, and Gods good blessing, and ef|fectuall impression and second|ing all this, that <HI>to will, and to do,</HI> may by him be wrought to great purposes, and with great speed.</P>
<P>And therefore it will not be amisse, but it is hugely necessary, that these persons who have lost their time and their blessed op|portunities should have the dili|gence of youth, and the zeal of new converts, and take account of every hour that is left them, and pray perpetually, and be ad|vised
<PB REF="15">
prudently, and study the interest of their souls carefully, with diligence, and with fear; and their old age which in effect is nothing, but a continuall death-bed, dressed with some more or|der and advantages, may be a state of hope, and labour, and ac|ceptance, through the infinite mercies of God in Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>But concerning sinners, really under the arrest of death, God hath made no death-bed cove|nant, the Scripture hath recorded no promises, given no instructi|ons; and therefore I had none to give, but onely the same which are to be given to all men that are alive, because they are so, and because it is uncertain when they shall be otherwise; But then this advice I also am to insert. That they are the smallest number of Christian men, who can be divi|ded by the characters of <HI>a certain
<PB REF="16">
holinesse,</HI> or <HI>an open villany:</HI> and between these, there are many degrees of latitude, and most are of a middle sort, concerning which we are tied to make the judgements of charity, and pos|sibly God may do so too; But however, all they are such to whom the rules of holy dying are usefull and applicable, and therefore no separation is to be made in this world; but where the case <HI>is not evident,</HI> men are to be permitted to the unerring judgement of God, where <HI>it is evident,</HI> we can <HI>rejoyce</HI> or <HI>mourn</HI> for them that die.</P>
<P>In the Church of Rome they reckon otherwise concerning sick and dying Christians then I have done. For they make profession, that from death to life, from sin to grace, a man may very certain|ly be changed, though the ope|ration begin not before his last
<PB REF="16">
hour, and <HI>half this,</HI> they do upon his death bed&punc; and the other half when he is in his grave: and they take away the <HI>eternal punishment</HI> in an instant, by a school distincti|on or the hand of the Priest; and <HI>the temporal punishment</HI> shall stick longer, even then when the man is no more <HI>measured with time,</HI> having nothing to do with any thing <HI>of, or under the sun</HI>; but that they pretend to take away too, when the man is dead; and, God knowes, the poor man for all this, payes them both in hell. The di|stinction of <HI>temporal</HI> and <HI>eternal</HI> is a just measure of pains, when it referres to <HI>this life</HI> and <HI>another</HI>; but to dream of a punishment <HI>temporal</HI> when all his <HI>time is done,</HI> and to think of repentance when the time of grace is past, are great errours; the one in Philosophy, and both in Divinity, and are a huge folly in their pretence, and
<PB REF="17">
infinite danger if they are be|lieved; being a certain destructi|on of the necessity of holy li|ving, when men dare trust them, and live at the rate of such do|ctrines. The secret of these is soon discovered: for by such means though <HI>a holy life be not</HI> ne|cessary, yet <HI>a priest is</HI>; as if God did not appoint the Priest to mi|nister to holy living, but to ex|cuse it; so making <HI>the holy calling</HI> not onely to live upon the sins of the people, but upon their ruine; and the advantages of their fun|ction to spring from their eternal dangers. It is an evil craft to serve a temporal end upon the death of souls; that, is an interest not to handled but with noblenesse and ingenuity, fear and caution, dili|gence and prudence, with great skill, and great honesty, with re|verence and trembling, and seve|rity: a soul is worth all that,
<PB REF="17">
and the need we have requires all that; and therefore those do|ctrines that go lesse then all this, are not friendly, because they are not safe.</P>
<P>I know no other great difference in the visitation and treating of sick persons, then what depends upon the article of late repen|tance; for all Churches agree in the same essential propositions, and assist the sick by the same in|ternal ministeries; as for <HI>exter|nal,</HI> I mean <HI>unction,</HI> used in the Church of Rome, since it is used when the man is above half dead, when he can exercise no act of understanding, it must needs be nothing; for no rational man can think that any ceremonie can make a spiritual change without a spiritual act of him that is to be changed; nor work by way of nature, or by charme; but mo|rally and after the manner of rea|sonable
<PB REF="18">
creatures; and there|fore I do not think that mini|stery at all fit to be reckoned among the advantages of sick persons. The Fathers of the Councel of Trent first dispu|ted and after their manner at last agreed, that <HI>extream unction was instituted by Christ.</HI> But after|wards, being admonished by one of their Theologues, that the A|postles ministred unction to in|firm people before they were Priests (the Priestly order ac|cording to their doctrine being collated in the institution of the last Supper) for fear that it should be thought that this unction might be administred by him that was no Priest, they blotted out the word [insti|tuted] and put in its stead [insinuated] this Sacrament;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Concil. Trid. hist lib 4.</NOTE> and that it was <HI>published by</HI> Saint <HI>Iames.</HI> So it is in their <HI>Do|ctrine</HI>:
<PB REF="18">
and yet in their anathe|matismes, they curse all them that shall deny it to have been [insti|tuted] <HI>by Christ.</HI> I shall lay no more prejudice against it, or the weak arts of them that maintain it, but adde this onely, that there being but two places of Scripture pretended for this ceremonie, some chief men of their own side have proclaimed those two invalid as to the institution of it; for <HI>Suarez</HI> sayes that the unction used by the Apostles in S. Mark 6.13. is not the same with what is used in the Church of Rome; and that it cannot be plainly ga|thered from the Epistle of Saint <HI>Iames, Cajetan</HI> affirms, and that it did belong to the miraculous gift of healing, not to a Sacrament. The sick mans exercise of grace formerly acquired, his perfect|ing repentance begun in the dayes of health, the prayers and coun|sels
<PB REF="19">
of the Holy man that mini|sters, the giving the Holy Sacra|ment, the Ministery and assistance of Angels, and the mercies of God, the peace of conscience and the peace of the Church are all the assistances and preparatives that can help to dresse his lamp. But if a man shall go to buy oil, when the Bridegroom comes, if his lamp be not first furnish'd, and then trimmed, <HI>that</HI> in his life, <HI>this</HI> upon his death-bed, his stati|on shall be without doors, his portion with unbelievers, and the unction of the dying man shall no more strengthen his soul, then it cures his body, and the prayers for him after his death shall be of the same force as if they should pray that he should return to life again the next day, and live as long as <HI>Lazarus</HI> in his return. But I consider, that it is not well, that men should pretend any thing
<PB REF="19">
will do a man good when he dies, and yet the same ministeries and ten times more assistances are found for fourty or fifty years together to be ineffectual; can ex|treme unction at last cure what the Holy Sacrament of the Eu|charist all his life time could not do? Can prayers for a dead man do him more good then when he was alive? If <HI>all his dayes</HI> the man belonged to death and the do|minion of sin, and from thence could not be recovered by Ser|mons, and counsels, and perpe|tual precepts, and frequent Sacra|ments, by confessions and abso|lutions, by prayers and advoca|tions, by external ministeries and internal acts, it is but too certain that his lamp cannot then be fur|nished; his extreme unction is onely then of use when it is made by the oil that burned in his lamp in all the dayes of his expecta|tion
<PB REF="20">
and waiting for the coming of the Bridegroom.</P>
<P>Neither can any supply be made in this case by their practise of praying for the dead: though they pretend for this the fairest precedents of the Church and of the whole world. The Heathens they say did it; and the Jews did it, and the Christians did it; some were <HI>baptized for the dead</HI> in the dayes of the Apostles; and very many were <HI>communicated for the dead</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Tertul de Monog. S. Cyprian l. 1. ep. 9 Sa. Athan q. 33. S. Cyril. myst. cat. 5. Epiphan. Haeres. 75. Aug. de haeres. c. 33. Concil. Carth. 3. c. 29</NOTE> for many ages af|ter: Tis true they were so, and did so: the Hea|thens prayed <HI>for an easie</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><P>Dii majorum um|bris tenuem &amp; sine pondere terram</P>

<BIBL><HI>Pers. Sat.</HI> 7.</BIBL></NOTE> <HI>grave and a perpetual spring, that Saffron would rise</HI> from their beds of grasse. The Jews prayed that the souls of their dead might be in the garden of Eden, that they might have their part in Paradise, and in the world
<PB REF="20">
to come, and that they might hear the peace of the fathers of their generations sleeping in Hebron: and the Christians prayed for <HI>a joyful resurrection,</HI> for <HI>mercy at the day of judgement,</HI> for <HI>the hastning of the coming of Christ, &amp; the king|dom of God</HI>; and they named all sorts of persons in their prayers, all I mean but wicked persons, all but them that liv'd evil lives; they named Apostles, Saints, and Mar|tyrs; and all this is so nothing to their purpose, or so much against it, that the prayers for the dead used in the Church of Rome are moct plainly condemned, be|cause they are against the do|ctrine and practises of all the world; in other forms to other purposes, relying upon distinct doctrines, until new opinions be|gan to arise about S. <HI>Augustines</HI> time, and changed the face of the proposition. <HI>Concerning prayer for
<PB REF="21">
the dead the Church hath received no commandment from the Lord</HI>; and therefore concerning it we can have no rules, nor proporti|ons, but from those imperfect re|velations of the state of departed souls, and the measures of cha|rity, which can relate onely to the imperfection of their pre|sent condition, and the terrors of the day of judgement: but to think that any suppletory to an evil life can be taken from such devotions after the sinners are dead may incourage a bold man to sin, but cannot relieve him when he hath.</P>
<P>But of all things in the world me thinks men should be most careful not to abuse dying peo|ple; not onely because their condition is pitiable, but because they shall soon be discovered, and in the secret regions of souls, there shall be an evil report con|cerning
<PB REF="21">
those men who have deceived them; and if we be|lieve we shall go to that place where such reports are made, we may fear the shame and the amazement of being accounted impostors in the presence of An|gels, and all the wise holy men of the world. To be erring and in|nocent is hugely pitiable, and in|cident to mortality, <HI>that,</HI> we can|not help; but to deceive or to destroy so great an interest as is that of a soul, or to lessen its ad|vantages by giving it trifling and false confidences, is injurious and intolerable. And therefore, it were very well, if all the Churches of the world would be extremely curious concern|ing their offices and ministeries of <HI>the visitation of the sick</HI>; that their Ministers they send be holy, and prudent; that their instru|ctions be severe and safe; that
<PB REF="22">
their sentences be merciful and reasonable; that their offices be sufficient and devout; that their attendances be frequent and long; that their deputations be special, and peculiar; that the doctrines upon which they ground their offices be true, material and holy; that their ceremonies be few; and their advices wary; that their se|paration be full of caution; their judgements not remisse; their remissions not loose and disso|lute; and that all the whole mi|nistration be made by persons of experience and charity; for it is a sad thing to see our dead go forth of our hands; they live incuriously and dye without re|gard, and the last scene of their life, which should be dressed with all spiritual advantages, is abused by flattery and easie pro|positions, and let go with care|lesnesse and folly.</P>
<P><PB REF="22">My Lord, I have endeavou|red to cure some part of the evil as well as I could; being willing to relieve the needs of indigent people in such wayes as I can, and therefore have described the du|ties which every sick man may do alone, and such in which he can be assisted by the Minister; and am the more confident that these my endeavours will be the better entertained, because they are the first intire body of directions for sick and dying people that I re|member to have been published in the Church of England: In the Church of Rome there have been many, but they are dressed with such Doctrines which are some|times uselesse, sometimes hurt|full, and their whole designe of assistance which they commonly yeeld, is at the best imperfect, and the representment is too care|lesse and loose for so severe an
<PB REF="23">
imployment: So that in this af|fair I was almost forced to walk alone, onely that I drew the rules and advices from the fountains of Scripture, and the purest chan|nels of the Primitive Church, and was helped by some experience in the cure of souls. I shall mea|sure the successe of my labours, not by popular noises or the sen|tences of curious persons, but by the advantage which good peo|ple may receive; my work here is not to please the speculative part of men, but to minister to practise, to preach to the weary, to comfort the sick, to assist the penitent, to reprove the confi|dent, to strengthen weak hands and feeble knees, having scarce any other possibilities left me of doing alms, or exercising that charity by which we shall be judged at Doomsday. It is enough for me to be an underbuilder in
<PB REF="23">
the House of God, and I glory in the imployment; I labour in the foundations, and therefore the work needs no Apology for being plain, so it be strong and well laid. But (My Lord) as mean as it is, I must give God thanks for the desires and the strength, and next to him, to you for that opportunity and little portion of leisure which I had to do it in; for I must ac|knowledge it publikely (and be|sides my prayers, it is all the re|compence I can make you) my being quiet I owe to your Inter|est,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Otia das nobis sed qualia fo|rat ulio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Meccenas Placco Virgilio. que m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> much of my support to your bounty, and many other collate|rall comforts I derive from your favour and noblenesse. (My Lord) because I much honour you, and because I would do honour to my self, I have writ|ten your Name in the entrance of my Book, I am sure you will
<PB REF="24">
entertain it because the designe related to your Dear Lady, and because it may minister to your spirit in the day of visitation when God shall call for you to receive your reward for your charity and your noble piety, by which you have not onely en|deared very many persons, but in great degrees have obliged me to be</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I. Consideration of the vanity, and shortnesse of Mans life.</HEAD>
<P>_A <HI>Man is a Bubble</HI> (said the Greek Proverb);<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> which <HI>Lucian</HI> repre|sents with advantages and its pro|per circumstances, to this pur|pose; saying, that all the world is a storm, and Men rise up in their several ge|nerations like bubbles descending <HI>&agrave; Iove plu|vio,</HI> from God, and the dew of Heaven, from a tear and drop of Man, from Nature and Pro|vidence: and some of these instantly sink into the deluge of their first parent, and are hidden in a sheet of Water, having had no other busi|nesse in the world, but to be born that they might be able to die: others float up and down two or three turns, and suddenly disap|pear and give their place to others: and they
<PB N="2" REF="30">
that live longest upon the face of the waters are in perpetual motion, restlesse and uneasy, and being crushed with the great drop of a cloud sink into flatness and a froth; the change not being great, it being hardly possible it should be more a nothing then it was before. So is every man: He is born in vanity and sin; he comes into the world like morning Mush|romes, soon thrusting up their heads into the air and conversing with their kinred of the same production, and as soon they turn into dust and forgetfulnesse; some of them with|out any other interest in the affairs of the world, but that they made their parents a little glad, and very sorrowful: others ride longer in the storm; it may be until seven yeers of Vanity be expired, and then peradventure the Sun shines hot upon their heads and they fall into the shades below, into the cover of death, and darknesse of the grave to hide them. But if the bubble stands the shock of a bigger drop, and outlives the chances of a childe, of a carelesse Nurse, of drowning in a pail of water, of being overlaid by a sleepy servant, or such little accidents, then the young man dances like a bubble, empty and gay, and shines like a Doves neck or the image of a rainbow, which hath no substance, and whose very imagery and colours are phantastical; and so he dances out the gayety of his youth, and is all the while in a storm, and endures, onely because he is not knocked on the head by a drop of bigger rain, or crushed by the pressure of a load of indigested meat, or quenched by the disorder of an ill placed humor: and to preserve a man alive in the midst of so many chances, and
<PB N="3" REF="30">
hostilities, is as great a miracle as to create him; to preserve him from rushing into nothing and at first to draw him up from nothing were e|qually the issues of an Almighty power. And therefore the wise men of the world have con|tended who shall best fit mans condition with words signifying his vanity and short abode. <HI>Homer</HI> cals a man <HI>a leaf,</HI> the smallest, the weakest piece of a short liv'd, unsteady plant. <HI>Pindar</HI> calls him <HI>the dream of a shadow</HI>: Another, <HI>the dream of the shadow of smoak.</HI> But S. <HI>Iames</HI> spake by a more excellent Spirit, saying,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4 James 14. <GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> <HI>Our life is but a vapor</HI>] <HI>viz.</HI> drawn from the earth by a coelestial influence; made of smoak, or the lighter parts of water, tossed with every winde, moved by the motion of a superiour body, without vertue in it self, lifted up on high, or left below, according as it pleases the Sun its Foster-father. But it is lighter yet. It is but <HI>appearing.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE> A phantastic vapor, an apparition, nothing real; it is not so much as a mist, not the matter of a shower, nor substantial enough to make a cloud; but it is like <HI>Cassiopeia's</HI> chair, or <HI>Pelops</HI> shoulder, or the circles of Heaven, <GAP DESC="foreign">, for which you cannot have a word that can signify a veryer nothing.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> And yet the ex|pression is one degree more made diminutive: <HI>A vapor,</HI> and <HI>phantastical,</HI> or <HI>a meer appearance,</HI> and this but <HI>for a little while</HI> neither: the very dream, the phantasm disappears in a small time, <HI>like the shadow that departeth,</HI> or <HI>like a tale that is told,</HI> or <HI>as a dream when one awaketh</HI>: A man is so vain, so unfixed, so perishing a creature, that he cannot long last in the scene of fancy: a man goes off and is forgotten like the dream of a distracted person. The summe of all is

this:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> <HI>That thou art a man,</HI> then whom there is not in the world any great|er instance of heights and declen|sions, of lights and shadows, of mi|sery and folly, of laughter and tears, of groans and death.</P>
<P>And because this consideration is of great usefulnesse and great necessity to many purpo|ses of wisdom and the Spirit; all the succession of time, all the changes in nature, all the va|rieties of light and darknesse, the thousand thousands of accidents in the world, and every contingency to every man, and to every crea|ture does preach our funeral sermon, and calls us to look, and see, how the old Sexton <HI>Time</HI> throws up the earth, and digs a Grave where we must lay our sins, or our sorrows, and sowe our bodies till they rise again in a fair, or in an intolerable eternity.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>Nihil sibi quisquam de futuro debet promit|tere.

<BIBL>Senec.</BIBL></NOTE> Every revolution which the sun makes about the world, divides between life and death; and death possesses both those portions by the next morrow; and we are dead to all those moneths which we have al|ready lived, and we shall never live them over again: and still God makes little periods of our age. First we change our world, when we come from the womb to feel the warmth of the sun: Then we sleep and enter into the image of death, in which state we are unconcerned in all the changes of the world; and if our Mothers, or our Nurses die, or a wilde boar destroy our vineyards, or our King be sick, we regard it not, but, during that state, are as disinterest, as if our eyes were
<PB N="5" REF="31">
closed with the clay that weeps in the bowels of the earth. At the end of seven years, our teeth fall and dye before us, representing a formal prologue to the Tragedie; and still every seven year it is oddes but we shall finish the last scene: and when Nature, or Chance, or Vice takes our body in pieces, weakening some parts, and loosing others, <HI>we taste the grave</HI> and the solennities of our own Funerals, first in those parts that ministred to Vice, and next in them that served for Ornament; and in a short time even they that served for necessity become uselesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><L>Ut mortem citius venire credas,</L>
<L>Scito jam capitis perisse partem.</L></NOTE> and intangled like the wheels of a broken clock. <HI>Baldnesse</HI> is but a dressing to our funerals, the proper or|nament of mourning, and of a person en|tred very far into the regions and possession of Death: And we have many more of the same signification: Gray hairs, rotten teeth, dim eyes, trembling joynts, short breath, stiffe limbs, wrinkled skin, short memory, decayed appetite. Every dayes necessity calls for a re|paration of that portion which death fed on all night when we lay in his lap, and slept in his outer chambers: The very spirits of a man prey upon the daily portion of bread and flesh, and every meal is a rescue from one death, and layes up for another; and while we think a thought, we die; and the clock strikes, and reckons on our portion of Eternity; we form our words with the breath of our nostrils, we have the lesse to live upon, for every word we speak.</P>
<P>Thus Nature calls us to meditate of death by those things which are the instruments of acting it; and God by all the variety of his
<PB N="6" REF="32">
Providence, makes us see death every where, in all variety of circumstances, and dressed up for all the fancies, and the expectation of every single person. Nature hath given us one har|vest every year, but death hath two: and the Spring and the Autumn send throngs of Men and Women to charnel houses; and all the Summer long men are recovering from their evils of the Spring, till the dog dayes come, and then the Syrian star makes the summer deadly; And the fruits of Autumn are laid up for all the years provision, and the man that gathers them eats and sursets, and dies and needs them not, and himself is laid up for Eternity; and he that escapes till winter, only stayes for another opportunity, which the di|stempers of that quarter minister to him with great variety. Thus death reigns in all the por|tions of our time. The Autumn with its fruits provides disorders for us: and the Winters cold turns them into sharp diseases, and the Spring brings flowers to strew our herse, and the Summer gives green turfe and brambles to binde upon our graves. Calentures, and Sur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et, Cold, and Agues, are the four quarters of the year, and all minister to Death; and you can go no whither, but you tread upon a dead mans bones.</P>
<P>The wilde fellow in <HI>Petronius</HI> that escaped upon a broken table from the furies of a ship|wrack, as he was sunning himself upon the rocky shore espied a man rolled upon his float|ing bed of waves, ballasted w^t^h sand in the folds of his garment, and carried by his civil enemy the sea towards the shore to finde a grave; and it cast him into some sad thoughts: that perad|venture

These are the thoughts of mortals, this is the end and sum of all their designes: a dark night, and an ill Guide, a boysterous sea, and a bro|ken Cable, a hard rock, and a rough winde dash'd in pieces the fortune of a whole family, and they that shall weep loudest for the acci|dent, are not yet entred into the storm, and yet have suffered shipwrack. Then looking upon the carkasse, he knew it, and found it to be the Master of the ship, who the day before cast up the accounts of his patrimony and his trade, and named the day, when he thought to be at home: see how the man swims who was so angry two dayes since; his passions are be|calm'd with the storm, his accounts cast up, his cares at an end, his voyage done, and his gains are the strange events of death, which whither they be good or evil, the men that are alive, seldom trouble themselves concerning the in|terest of the dead.</P>

of his crowns and triumphs, fights unpro|sperously, or falls into a Feaver with joy and wine, and changes his Lawrel into Cypresse, his triumphal chariot to an Hearse; dying the night before he was appointed to perish in the drunkennesse of his festival joyes. It was a sad arrest of the loosenesses and wilder feasts of the French Court, when their King [<HI>Henry</HI> 2.] was killed really by the sportive image of a fight. And many brides have died under the hands of Paranymphs and Maidens dressing them for uneasy joy, the new and undiscerned chains of Marriage: according to the saying of <HI>Bensirah</HI> the wise Jew,
<Q>The Bride went into her chamber, and knew not what should befall her there.</Q>
Some have been paying their vows, and giving thanks for a prosperous return to their own house, and the roof hath descended upon their heads, and turned their loud religi|on into the deeper silence of a grave: And how many teeming Mothers have rejoyced over their swelling wombs, and pleased themselves in becoming the chanels of blessing to a fami|lie; and the Midwife hath quickly bound their heads and feet,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><L>Quia lex eadem manet omnes</L>

<P>There is no state, no accident no circum|stance of our life, but it hath been sowred by some sad instance of a dying friend: a friendly meeting often ends in some sad mischance, and
<PB N="9" REF="33">
makes an eternal parting: and when the Poet <HI>Eschylus</HI> was sitting under the walls of his house, an eagle hovering over his bald head, mistook it for a stone, and let fall his oyster, hoping there to break the shell, but pierced the poor mans skull.</P>
<P>Death meets us every where, and is pro|cured by every instrument, and in all chances, and enters in at many doors: by violence, and secret influence, by the aspect of a star, and the stink of a mist, by the emissions of a cloud, and the meeting of a vapor, by the fall of a chariot, and the stumbling at a stone, by a full meal, or an empty stomach, by watching at the wine, or by watching at prayers, by the Sun or the Moon, by a heat or a cold, by sleep|lesse nights,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>Aut ubi mors non est si ju|gulatis a|quae?</P>

<P>IT will be very material to our best and no|blest purposes, if we represent this scene of change and sorrow a little more dressed up in Circumstances, for so we shall be more apt to practice those Rules, the doctrine of which is consequent to this consideration. * It is a mighty change that is made by the death of every person, and it is visible to us who are a|live.

Rose newly springing from the clefts of its hood, and at first it was fair as the Morning, and full with the dew of Heaven, as a Lambs fleece; but when a ruder breath had forced open its virgin modesty, and dismantled its too youthful and unripe retirements, it began to put on darknesse, and to decline to softnesse, and the symptomes of a sickly age; it bowed the head, and broke its stalk, and at night having lost some of its leaves, and all its beau|ty, it fell into the portion of weeds and out|worn faces: The same is the portion of every man, and every woman; the heritage of worms and serpents, rottennesse and cold dishonour, and our beauty so changed that our acquain|tance quickly knew us not, and that change mingled with so much horrour, or else meets so with our fears and weak discoursings, that they who six hours ago tended upon us, either with charitable or ambitious services cannot without some regret stay in the room alone where the body lies stripped of its life and Honour.

There is an acre sown with royal seed, the copy of the greatest change, from rich to naked, from ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">led roofs to arched coffins, from <HI>living like Gods</HI> to <HI>dye like Men.</HI> There is enough to cool the flames of lust, to abate the heights of pride, to appease the itch of covetous desires, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ully and dash out the dissembling colours of a lust|ful, artificial, and imaginary beauty. There the warlike and the peaceful, the fortunate and the miserable, the beloved and the despised Princes mingle their dust, and pay down their symbol of Mortality, and tell all the world, that when we die, our ashes shall be equal to Kings, and our accounts easier, and our pains or our crowns shall be lesse. * To my apprehension it is a sad record which is left by <HI>Athenaeus</HI> con|cerning <HI>Ninus</HI> the great Assyrian Monarch, whose life and death is summed up in these words:
<Q><HI>Ninus</HI> the Assyrian had an Ocean of gold, and other riches more then the sand in the Caspian sea: he never saw the stars, and per|haps he never desired it; he never stirred up the holy fire among the <HI>Magi,</HI> nor touched his God with the sacred rod according to the Laws; he never offered sacrifice, nor wor|shipped the Deity, nor administred justice, nor

spake to his people, nor numbred them; but he was most valiant to eat and drink, and having mingled his wines he threw the rest upon the stones: This man is dead; Behold his Sepulchre, and now hear where <HI>Ninus</HI> is. Some times I was <HI>Ninus,</HI> and drew the breath of a living man, but now am nothing but clay. I have nothing, but what I did eat, and what I served to my self in lust [that was and is all my portion;] the wealth with which I was [esteemed] blessed, my enemies meet|ing together shall bear away, as the mad <HI>Thy|ades</HI> carry a raw Goat.

<HEAD>SECT. III. Rules and Spiritual arts of lengthening our dayes, and to take off the objection of a short life.</HEAD>
<P>IN the accounts of a mans life we do not reckon that portion of dayes in which we are shut up in the prison of the womb: we tell our years from the day of our birth: and the same reason that makes our reckning to stay so long, sayes also that then it begins too soon. For then we are beholding to others to make the account for us: for we know not of a long time, whether we be alive or no, having but some little approaches and symptoms of a life. To feed, and sleep, and move a little, and im|perfectly, is the state of an unborn childe; and when it is born, he does no more for a good while; and what is it that shall make him to be esteemed to live the life of a man? and when shall that account begin? For we should be loath to have the accounts of our age taken by the measures of a beast: and fools and distracted persons are reckoned as <HI>civilly dead</HI>; they are no parts of the Com|mon-wealth, not subject to laws, but secured by them in Charity, and kept from violence as a man keeps his Ox; and a third part of our life is spent, before we enter into a higher order, into the state of a man.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="22" REF="40">2. Neither must we think, that the life of a Man begins when he can feed himself or walk alone, when he can fight, or beget his like; for so he is contemporary with a camel, or a cow; but he is first a man when he comes to a cer|tain, steddy use of reason, according to his pro|portion, and when that is, all the world of men cannot tell precisely. Some are called <HI>at age,</HI> at fourteen, some at one and twenty, some never; but all men, late enough; for the life of a man comes upon him slowly and insensibly. But as when the Sun approaches towards the gates of the morning, he first opens a little eye of Heaven, and sends away the spirits of dark|nesse, and gives light to a cock, and calls up the lark to Mattins, and by and by gilds the fringes of a cloud and peeps over the Eastern hills, thrusting out his golden horns, like those which decked the browes of <HI>Moses</HI> when he was forced to wear a vail, because himself had seen the face of God; and still while a man tells the story, the sun gets up higher, till he showes a fair face and a full light, and then he shines one whole day, under a cloud often, and sometimes weeping great and little showers, and sets quickly: so is a mans reason and his life. He first begins to perceive himself to see or taste, making little reflections upon his actions of sense, and can discourse of flies and dogs, shells and play, horses and liberty; but when he is strong enough to enter into arts and little institutions, he is at first entertained with trifles and impertinent things, not be|cause he needs them, but because his under|standing is no bigger; and little images of things are laid before him, like a cock-boat to
<PB N="23" REF="40">
a whale onely to play withall: but before a man comes to be wise he is half dead with gouts and consumptions, with Catarrhes and aches, with sore eyes, and a worn out body: so that if we must not reckon the life of a man but by the accounts of his reason, he is long before his soul be dressed; and he is not to be called a man without a wise and an adorned soul, a soul at least furnished with what is ne|cessary towards his well being; but by that time his soul is thus furnished, his body is de|cayed; and then you can hardly reckon him to be alive, when his body is possessed by so many degrees of death.</P>
<P N="3">3. But there is yet another arrest. At first he wants strength of body, and then he wants the use of reason; and when that is come, it is ten to one, but he stops by the impediments of vice, and wants the strengths of the <HI>spirit</HI>; and we know that <HI>Body</HI> and <HI>Soul</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> are the constituent parts of every Christian man. And now let us consider, what that thing is, which we call <HI>years of discretion</HI>? The young man is passed his Tutors, and arrived at the bondage of a caytive spirit; he is run from di|scipline, and is let loose to passion; the man by this time hath wit enough to chuse his vice, to act his lust, to court his Mistresse, to talk confidently, and ignorantly, and perpetually, to despise his betters, to deny nothing to his appetite, to do things, that when he is indeed a man he must for ever be ashamed of; for this is all the discretion that most men show in the first stage of their Manhood; they can discern good from evil; and they prove their skill by leaving all that is good, and wallowing in the
<PB N="24" REF="41">
evils of folly, and an unbridled appetite. And by this time, the young man hath contracted vitious habits, and is a beast in manners, and therefore it will not be fitting to reckon the beginning of his life; he is a fool in his un|derstanding, and that is a sad death; and he is dead in trespasses and sins, and that is a sadder: so that he hath no life but a natural, the life of a beast or a tree; in all other capacities he is dead; he neither hath the intellectual, nor the spiritual life, neither the life of a man, nor of a Christian; and this sad truth lasts too long. For old age seizes upon most men while they still retain the minds of boyes and vitious youth, doing actions from principles of great folly, and a mighty ignorance, admiring things uselesse and hurtfull, and filling up all the di|mensions of their abode with businesses of empty affairs, being at leasure to attend no vertue: they cannot pray, because they are busie, and because they are passionate: they cannot communicate because they have quar|rels and intrigues of perplexed causes, com|plicated hostilities, and things of the world; and therefore they cannot attend to the things of God, little considering, that they must find a time to die in; when death comes, they must be at leisure for that. Such men are like Sailers loosing from a port, and tost immediatly with a perpetual tempest lasting till their cordage crack, and either they sink, or return back again to the same place: they did not make a voyage, though they were long at sea. The businesse and impertinent affairs of most men, steal all their time, and they are restlesse in a foolish motion; but this is not the progress of a man;
<PB N="25" REF="41">
he is no further advanc'd in the course of a life though he reckon many years:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><L>Bis jam consul trigesimus instat</L>
<L>Et numerat paucos vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> tua vita dies.</L></NOTE> for still his soul is childish, and trifling like an untaught boy.</P>
<P>If the parts of this sad complaint finde their remedy, we have by the same instruments also cured the evils and the vanity of a short life. Therefore,</P>
<P N="1">1. Be infinitely curious you doe not set back your life in the accounts of God by the intermingling of criminal actions, or the con|tracting vitious habits. There are some vices which carry a sword in their hand and cut a man off before his time. There is <HI>a sword of the Lord,</HI> and there is <HI>a sword of a Man</HI>; and there is <HI>a sword of the Devil.</HI> Every vice of our own managing in the matter of carnality, of lust, or rage, ambition or revenge is a sword of Sathan put into the hands of a man: These are the destroying Angels, sin is the <HI>Apollyon,</HI> the <HI>destroyer</HI> that is gone out, not <HI>from the Lord,</HI> but <HI>from the Tempter</HI>; and we hug the poison, and twist willingly with the vipers, till they bring us into the Regions of an irre|coverable sorrow. We use to reckon persons as good as dead if they have lost their limbs and their teeth, and are confined to an Hospi|tal, and converse with none but Surgeons and Physicians, Mourners and Divines, those <HI>pollin|ctores,</HI> the Dressers of bodies and souls to Funeral: But it is worse when the soul, the principle of life is imployed wholly in the offices of death: and that man was worse then dead of whom <HI>Seneca</HI> tells, that being a rich fool, when he was lifted up from the baths and set into a soft couch, asked his slaves
<PB N="26" REF="42">
<HI>An ego jam sedeo</HI>? Do I now sit. The beast was so drownd in sensuality and the death of his soul, that whether he did sit or no, he was to be|lieve another. Idlenesse and every vice is as much of death as a long disease is, or the ex|pence of ten years: and she that lives in pleasures is dead while she liveth (saith the Apostle), and it is the stile of the Spirit concerning wicked persons, <HI>They are dead in trespasses and sins.</HI> For as every sensual pleasure and every day of idlenes and useless living lops off a little branch from our short life; so every deadly sin and every habitual vice does quite destroy us: but innocence leaves us in our na|tural portions, and perfect period; we lose no|thing of our life, if we lose nothing of our souls health; and therefore he that would live a full age must avoid a sin, as he would decline the Regions of death, &amp; the dishonors of the grave.</P>
<P N="2">2. If we would have our life lengthened, let us begin b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">times to live in the accounts of reason and sober counsels,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aedepol proinde ut bene vivitur, diu vivi|tur.

But when we spend in waste, what God hath given us in plenty, when we sacrifice our youth to folly, our manhood to lust and rage, our old age to covetousnesse and irreligion, not beginning to live till we are to die, designing that time to Vertue which indeed is infirm to every thing and profit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ble to nothing, then we make our lives short, and lust runs away with all the vi|gorous and healthful part of it; and pride and animosity steal the manly portion, and craftinesse and interest possesse old age; <HI>velut

But so the treasure of the <HI>Capitol</HI> is but a small <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">state when <HI>Caesar</HI> comes to finger it, and to pay with it all his Legions; and the Revenue of all Egypt and the Eastern provinces was but a little summe when they were to support the luxury of <HI>Marc. Antony,</HI> and feed the riot of <HI>Cleopatra</HI>: But a thousand crowns is a vast proportion to be spent in the cottage of a frugal person, or to feed a Hermit. Just so is our life; it is too short to serve the ambition of a haughty Prince, or an usurping Rebel: too little time to purchase great wealth, to satisfie the pride of a vain-glorious fool, to trample upon all the enemies of our just, or unjust interest; but for the obtaining vertue; for the purchase of sobriety and modesty, for the actions of Reli|gion God gave us time sufficient, if we <HI>make the outgoings of the Morning and Evening,</HI> that is, our infancy and old age to be t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ken into the computations of a man. Which we may see in the following particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. If our childhood being first consecrated by a forward baptisme, it be seconded by a holy education, and a complying obedi|ence; If our youth be chast and tempe|rate, modest and industrious, proceeding

<P N="2">2. If besides the ordinary returns of our prayers and periodical and festival solemnities, and our seldom communions we would allow to religion &amp; the studies of wisdom, those great shares that are trifled away upon vain sorrow, foolish mirth, troublesome ambition, buisy co|vetousnesse, watchful lust, and impertinent a|mours, and balls and revellings and banquets, all that which was spent vitiously &amp; all that time that lay fallow &amp; without imployment, our life would quickly amount to a great sum. <HI>Tostatus Abulensis</HI> was a very painful person and a great Cleark, and in the dayes of his manhood he wrote so many books, and they not ill ones, that the world computed a sheet for every day of his life; I suppose they meant, after he came to the use of reason, and the state of a man: and <HI>Iohn Scotus</HI> died about the two and thirtieth year of his age; and yet be|sides his publike disputations, his dayly Le|ctures of Divinity in publike and private, the Books that he wrote being lately collected and printed at Lyons do equal the number of volumes of any two the most voluminous Fa|thers of the Latine Church. Every man is not inabled to such imployments, but every man is called and inabled to the works of a sober and a religious life; and there are many Saints of God that can reckon as many
<PB N="29" REF="43">
volumes of religion and mountains of piety, as those others did of good books. S. <HI>Ambrose</HI> (and I think from his example, <HI>S. Augustine</HI>) divided every day into three tertia's of im|ployment: eight hours he spent in the ne|cessities of nature and recreation, eight hours in charity and doing assistance to others, dispatching their bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sinesses, recon|ciling their enmities, reproving their vices, correcting their errors, instructing their ig|norances, transacting the affairs of his Diocesse, and the other eight hours he spent in study and prayer. If we were thus minute and curious in the spending our time, it is impossible but our life would seem very long. For so have I seen an amorous person tell the minutes of his absence from his fancied joy, and while he told the sands of his hour-glasse, or the throbs and little beatings of his watch, by dividing an hour into so many members, he spun out its length by number, and so translated a day into the tediousnesse of a moneth. And if we tell our dayes by Canonical hours of prayer, our weeks by a constant revolution of fasting dayes, or dayes of special devotion, and over all these draw a black Cypresse a veil of penitential sorrow, and severe mortification, we shall soon answer the calumny and objection of a short life. He that governs the day and divides the hours hastens from the eyes and observa|tion of a merry sinner; but loves so stand still, and behold, and tell the sighs, and number the groans, and sadly delicious accents of a grieved penitent. It is a vast work that any man may do if he never be idle; and it is a huge way that a man may go in vertue if he never goes out of his way by a vitious habit,
<PB N="30" REF="44">
or a great crime, and he that perpetually reads good books, if his parts be answerable, will have a huge stock of knowledge. It is so in all things else. Strive not to forget your time, and suffer none of it to passe undiscerned, and then measure your life, and tell me how you finde the measure of its abode. How|ever, <HI>the time we live, is worth the money we pay for it</HI>: and therefore it is not to be thrown a|way.</P>
<P N="3">3. When vitious men are dying, and scar'd with the affrighting truths of an evil consci|ence, they would give all the world for a year, for a moneth; nay we read of some that called out with amazement <HI>inducias us&abque; ad mane, truce but till the morning</HI>: and if that year, or some few moneths were given, those men think they could do miracles in it. And let us a while suppose what <HI>Dives</HI> would have done if he had been loosed from the pains of hell and permitted to live on earth one year. Would all the pleasures of the world have kept him one hour from the Temple? would he not perpetually have been under the hands of Priests, or at the feet of the Doctors, or by <HI>Moses</HI> chair, or attending as neer the Altar as he could get, or relieving poor <HI>Lazars,</HI> or praying to God, and crucifying all his sin? I have read of a Melancholy person who saw hell but in a dream or vision, and the amaze|ment was such that he would have chosen ten times to die, rather then feel again so much of that horror: and such a person cannot be fan|cied but that he would spend a year in such holinesse, that the religion of a few moneths would equal the devotion of many years, even
<PB N="31" REF="44">
of a good man. Let us but compute the pro|portions. If we should spend all our years of reason so as such a person would spend that one, can it be thought that life would be short and trifling in which he had performed such a religion, served God with so much holinesse, mortified sin with so great a labour, purchased vertue at such a rate, and so rare an industry? It must needs be that such a man must dye when he ought to die, and be like ripe and pleasant fruit falling from a fair tree and ga|thered into baske<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s for the planters use: He that hath done <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll his busi|nesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><L>Huic ne&abque; defungi visum est, nec vivere pulchrum;</L>

<P><HI>Xerxes</HI> wept sadly when he saw his army of 2300000 men, because he considered that within a hundred years all the youth of that army should be dust and ashes: and yet as <HI>Seneca</HI> well observes of him, he was the man that should bring them to their graves; and he consumed all that army in two years, for whom he feared, and wept the death after an hundred. Just so we do all. We complain that within thirty or fourty years, a little more, or a great deal lesse we shall descend again into the bowels of our Mother, and that our life is too short for any great imployment; and yet we throw away five and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hirty yeers of our fourty, and the remaining five we divide between art and nature, civility and customs, necessity and convenience, prudent counsels and religion; but the portion of the last, is little and contemptible, and yet that little is
<PB N="32" REF="45">
all that we can prudently account of our lives: We bring that fate and that death neer us, of whose approach we are so sadly appre|hensive.</P>
<P N="4">4. In taking the accounts of your life do not reckon by great distances, and by the periods of pleasure, or the satisfaction of your hopes, or the stating your desires: but let every intermedial day and hour passe with ob|servation.

Hope and phantastic expectati|ons spend much of our lives; and while with passion we look for a coronation, or the death of an enemy, or a day of joy, passing from fancy to possession without any interme|dial notices, we throw away a precious year, and use it but as the burden of our time, fit to be pared off, and thrown away, that we may come at those little pleasures which first steal our hearts, and then steal our life.</P>
<P N="5">5. A strict course of piety is the way to prolong our lives in the natural sense, and to adde good portions to the number of our years; and sin is sometimes by natural causa|lity, very often by the anger of God, and the Divine judgement, a cause of sudden and untimely death. Concerning which I shall adde nothing (to what I have some where else <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Life of Christ, Part. 3. Disc. 14.</NOTE> said of this article) but onely the observa|tion of <HI>Epiphanius</HI>: that for 3332 years, even

<P N="6">6. But if I shall describe a living man; a man that hath that life that distinguishes him from a fool or a bird, that which gives him a capacity next to Angels; we shall finde that even a good man lives not long, because it is long before he is born to this life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seneca de vita beata. c. 20.</NOTE> and longer yet before he hath a mans growth.
<Q>He that can look upon death, and see its face with the same countenance with which he hears its story; that can endure all the labours of his life with his soul supporting his body; that can equally despise riches when he hath them, and when he hath them not; that is not sadder if they lye in his Neighbours trunks, nor more brag if they shine round about his own walls; he that is nei|ther moved with good fortune coming to him, nor going from him; that can look upon another mans lands evenly and pleased|ly as if they were his own; and yet look up|on his own, and use them too, just as if they were another mans; that neither spends his
<PB N="34" REF="46">
goods prodigally, and like a fool, nor yet keeps them avaritiously and like a wretch; that weighs not benefits by weight and num|ber, but by the mind &amp; circumstances of him that gives them; that never thinks his cha|rity expensive if a worthy person be the receiver; he that does nothing for opinion sake, but every thing for conscience, being as curious of his thoughts,
as of his actings in markets and Theaters, and is as much in awe of himself, as of a whole assembly;</Q> he that knowes God looks on, and contrives his secret affairs as in the presence of God and his holy Angels; that eats and drinks because he needs it, not that he may serve a lust or load his belly; he that is bountifull and cheerfull to his friends, and charitable and apt to for|give his enemies; that loves his countrey and obeyes his Prince, and desires and endeavours nothing more then that he may do honour to God, this person may reckon his life, to be the life of a man, and compute his moneths, not by the course of the sun, but the Zodiac and circle of his vertues: because these are such things which fools and children, and birds and beasts cannot have: These are there|fore the actions of life, because they are the feeds of immortality. That day in which we have done some excellent thing, we may as truly reckon to be added to our life, as were the fifteen years to the dayes of <HI>Hezekiah.</HI></P>

<P>AS our life is very short so it is very mi|serable, and therefore it is well it is short: God in pity to mankinde, lest his burden should be insupportable and his nature an intolerable load, hath reduced our state of misery to an abbreviature; and the greate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> our misery is, the lesse while it is like to last; the sorrows of a mans spirit being like pon|derous weights which by the greatnesse of their burden make a swifter motion and de|scend into the grave to rest and ease our wea|ried limbs; for then onely we shall sleep quietly when those fetters are knocked off which not onely bound our souls in prison, but also eat the flesh till the very bones open'd the secret garments of their cartilages, disco|vering their nakednesse and sorrow.</P>

Are there not many thou|sands that die every night, and that groan and weep sadly every day? But what shall we think of that great evil, which for the sins of men, God hath suffered to possess the greatest part of Mankinde? Most of the men that are now alive, or that have been living for many ages, are Jews, Heathens, or Turcs: and God was pleased to suffer a base Epileptic person, a villain and a vitious to set up a religion which hath filled almost all Asia, and Africa, and some parts of Europe; so that the greatest number of men and women born in so many king|doms and provinces are infallibly made Ma|humetans,

strangers and enemies to Christ, by whom alone we can be saved. This consi|deration is extremely sad, when we remember how universal, and how great an evil it is, that so many millions of sons and daughters are born to enter into the possession of Devils to eternal ages. These evils are the miseries of great parts of mankinde, and we cannot easily consider more particularly, the evils which happen to us, being the inseparable affections, or incidents to the whole nature of man.</P>
<P N="2">2. We finde that all the women in the world are either born for barrennesse or the pains of Child-birth, and yet this is one of our greatest blessings; but such indeed are the blessings of this world: we cannot be well with, nor with|out many things. Perfumes make our heads ake, roses prick our fingers, and in our very blood where our life dwells is the Scene under which nature acts many sharp Feavers and heavy sick|nesses. It were too sad if I should tell how many persons are afflicted with evil spirits, with spe|ctres and illusions of the night; and that huge multitudes of men and women live upon mans flesh: Nay worse yet, upon the sins of men, up|on the sins of their sons and of their daughters, and they pay their souls down for the bread they eat, buying this dayes meal with the price of the last nights sin.</P>

whose miseries are so great, that few people have charity or humanity enough to visit them, fewer have the heart to dresse them, and we pity them in civility or with a transient prayer, but we do not feel their sorrows by the mercies of a religious pity, and therefore as we leave their sorrows in many degrees un|relieved and uneased, so we contract by our unmercifulnesse a guilt by which our selves become liable to the same calamities.

For not only the winter quarter is full of storms and cold and darknesse, but the beauteous spring hath blasts and sharp frosts, the fruitful teeming summer is melted with heat, and burnt with the kisses of the sun her friend, and choaked with dust, and the rich Autumn is full of sicknesse, and we are weary of that which we enjoy, because sorrow is its biggest portion: and when we remember that upon the fairest face is placed one of the worst sinks of the body, <HI>the nose,</HI> we may use it, not only as a mortification to the pride of beauty, but as an allay to the fairest outside of condition which any of the sons and daughters of <HI>Adam</HI> do possesse. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><L>Vilis servus habet re|gni bona, cella&abque; capti</L>

<P N="6">6.

honest innocent and contented persons, whose minde is no bigger then their fortune, nor their vertue lesse then their security.

<HEAD>SECT. V. This Consideration reduced to practice.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THe effect of this consideration is this&punc; That the sadnesses of this life help to sweeten the bitter cup of Death. For let our life be never so long, if our strength were great as that of oxen and camels; if our sinews were strong as the cordage at the foot of an Oke, if we were as fighting and prosperous people as <HI>Siccius Dentatus,</HI> who was on the pre|vailing side in 120 battels, who had 312 pub|like rewards assigned him by his Generals and Princes for his valour, and conduct in sieges
<PB N="44" REF="51">
and short encounters, and besides all this had his share in nine triumphs, yet still the pe|riod shall be, that all this shall end in death, and the people shall talk of us a while, good or bad, according as we deserve, or as they please; and once it shall come to passe, that concerning every one of us it shall be told in the Neighbourhood that we are dead. This we are apt to think a sad story; but therefore let us help it with a sadder; For we therefore need not be much troubled that we shall die, because we are not here in ease, nor do we dwell in a fair condition. But our dayes are full of sor|row and anguish, dishonoured and made unhappy with many sins, with a frail and a foolish spirit, intangled with difficult cases of conscience, ins<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ared with passions, ama|zed with fears, full of cares, divided with curiosities and contradictory interests, made a&euml;ry and impertinent with vanities, abused with ignorance and prodigious errours, made ridiculous with a thousand weaknesses, worne away with labours, loaden with diseases, daily vexed with dangers and temptations, and in love with misery; we are weakned with delights, afflicted with want, with the evils of my self, and of all my family, and with the sadnesses of all my friends, and of all good men, even of the whole Church; and therefore me thinks we need not be trou|bled that God is pleased to put an end to all these troubles, and to let them sit down in a natural period, which if we please, may be to us the beginning of a better life. When the Prince of Persia wept because his army should all die in the revolution of an
<PB N="45" REF="51">
age, <HI>Artabanus</HI> told him, that they should all meet with evils so many and so great, that every man of them should wish him|self dead long before that. Indeed it were a sad thing to be cut of the stone; and we that are in health tremble to think of it; but the man that is wearied with the dis|ease, looks upon that sharpnesse as upon his cure and remedie: and as none need to have a tooth drawn, so none could well endure it, but he that hath felt the pain of it in his head: so is our life so full of evils, that therefore death is no evil to them that have felt the smart of this, or hope for the joyes of a better.</P>
<P N="2">2. But as it helps to ease a certain sor|row, as a fire drawes out fire, and a nail drives forth a nail; so it instructs us in a present duty; that is; that we should not be so fond of a perpetual storm, nor doat upon the transient gaudes and gilded thorns of this world. They are not worth a passion, not worth a sigh or a groan, not of the price of one nights watching; and therefore they are mistaken and miserable persons who since <HI>Adam</HI> planted thorns round about Paradise, are more in love with that hedge, then all the fruits of the garden, sottish admirers of things that hurt them, of sweet poisons, gilded daggers and silken halters. Tell them they have lost a bounteous friend, a rich purchase, a fair farm, a wealthy donative, and you dissolve their patience; it is an evil bigger then their spirit can bear, it brings sicknesse and death, they can neither eate nor sleep with such a sorrow. But if you represent to them the evils of a vitious ha|bit,

and the dangers of a state of sin; if you tell them they have displeased God, and interrupted their hopes of heaven, it may be they will be so civil as to hear it patiently, and to treat you kindly, and first commend, and then to forget your story, because they prefer this world with all its sorrowes, before the pure unmingled felicities of heaven. But it is strange that any man should be so passionately in love with the thorns that grow on his own ground, that he should wear them for armelets, and knit them in his shirt, and prefer them before a kingdom and immortality. No man loves this world the better for his being poor; but men that love it, because they have great possessions, love it because it is troublesome and chargeable, full of noise and temptation; because it is unsafe and ungoverned, flattered and abused: and he that considers the trou|bles of an overlong garment, and of a cram|med stomach, a trailing gown and a loaden Table, may justly understand that all that for which men are so passionate, is their hurt and their objection, that which a temperate man would avoid, and a wise man cannot love.</P>
<P>He that is no fool, but can consider wisely; if he be in love with this world; we need not despair but that a witty man might reconcile him with tortures, and make him think chari|tably of the Rack, and be brought to dwell with Vipers and Dragons, and entertain his Guests with the shrikes of Mandrakes, Cats and Scrich Owls, with the filing of iron, and the harshnesse of rending silk; or to admire the harmony that is made by a herd of E|vening wolves when they misse their draught of blood in their midnight Revels. The groans
<PB N="47" REF="52">
of a man in a fit of the stone are worse then all these; and the distractions of a troubled conscience are worse then those groans; and yet a carelesse merry sinner is worse then all that. But if we could from one of the battlements of Heaven espie how many men and women at this time lye fainting and dying for want of bread, how many young men are hewen down by the sword of war; how many poor Orphans are now weeping over the graves of their Father, by whose life they were enabled to eat. If we could but hear how many Mariners, and Passengers are at this present in a storm, and shrike out because their keel dashes a|gainst a Rock, or bulges under them; how many people there are that weep with want, and are mad with oppression, or are desperate by too quick a sense of a constant infelicity, in all reason we should be glad to be out of the noise and participation of so many evils. This is a place of sorrows and tears, of great evils and a constant calamity; let us remove from hence, at least in affections and prepa|ration of minde.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I. Three precepts preparatory to a holy death, to be practised in our whole life.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>HE that would die well must alwayes loook for death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Propera vivere, &amp; singulo, die, sin|gulas vi|tas puta Nihil in|terest in|ter diem &amp; secu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lum.</NOTE> every day knocking at the gates of the grave,</HI> and then the gates of the grave shall never prevail upon him to do him mischief. This was the advice of all the wise and good men of the world; who especially in the dayes and periods of their joy and festival egressions chose to throw some ashes into their chalices, some sober remembrances of their fatal pe|riod. Such was the black shirt of <HI>Saladine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><L>Si sap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, utatis totis Coline di|ebu,</L>
<L>Extremum&abque; tibi semper adesse putes.</L>

<PB N="49" REF="53">
on his Coronation day; the Bishop of Romes two reeds with flax and wax taper, the E|gyptian skeleton served up at feasts, and <HI>Tri|malcions</HI> banquet in <HI>Petronius,</HI> in which was brought in the image of a dead mans bones of silver with spondiles exactly turning to every of the Guests, and saying to every one,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><L>Heu, Heu! nos miseros, quam totus homuncio nil est</L>
<L>Sic erimus cuncti postquam nos auseret Orcus:</L>
<L>Ergo vivamus dum licet osse, bene.</L></NOTE> that you, and you must die, and look not one upon an|other, for every one is e|qually concerned in this sad representment. These in phantastic semblances declare a severe counsel and useful meditation; and it is not easy for a man to be gay in his imagination, or to be drunk with joy or wine, pride or revenge, who considers sadly that he must ere long dwell in a house of darknesse and dishonour, and his bodie must be the inheritance of worms, and his soul must be what he pleases, even as a man makes it here by his living good or bad. I have read of a young Hermit who being passionately in love with a young Lady could not by all the arts of religion and mortification suppresse the trouble of that fancy, till at last being told that she was dead and had been buried about fourteen dayes, he went secretly to her Vault, and with the skirt of his mantle wiped the moisture from the Carkasse, and still at the return of his tem|ptation laid it before him, saying, Behold this is the beauty of the woman thou didst so much desire; and so the man found his cure. And if we make death as present to us, our own death, dwelling and dressed in all its pomp of fancy and proper circumstances, if
<PB N="50" REF="54">
any thing will quench the heats of lust, or the desires of money, or the greedy passionate affections of this world, this must do it. But withall, the frequent use of this meditation, by curing our present inordinations will make death safe and friendly, and by its very custom will make that the King of terrours shall come to us without his affrighting dresses; and that we shall sit down in the grave as we com|pose our selves to sleep, and do the duties of nature and choice.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><L>&mdash;Certe populi quos despicit Arctos</L>

<L>Mortis, &amp; i navum rediturae parcerevitae</L></NOTE> The old people that lived neer the Riphae|an mountains, were taught to converse with death, and to handle it on all sides and to discourse of it, as of a thing that will cer|tainly come, and ought so to do. Thence their minds and resolutions became capable of death, and they thought it a dishonourable thing, with greedinesse to keep a life that must go from us, to lay aside its thorns, and to return a|gain circled with a glory and a Diadem.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>He that would die well must all the dayes of his life lay up against the day of death,</HI> not only by the general provisions of holinesse and a pious life indefinitely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Qui quo|tidie vitae tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e ma num i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|posuit n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n indi|gettem|pore. Senec.</NOTE> but, provisions proper to the necessities of that great day of ex|pence, in which a man is to throw his last cast for an eternity of joyes or sorrows; ever remembring, that this alone well performed is not enough to passe us into Paradise, but that alone done foolishly is enough to send us to hell; and the want of either a holy life, or death, makes a man to fall short of the mighty
<PB N="51" REF="54">
price of our high calling.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Insere nunc Melibaee pyros, ponc ordine vites.</NOTE> In order to this rule we are to consider what special graces we shall then need to exercise, and by the proper arts of the Spirit, by a heap of proportioned arguments, by prayers, and a great treasure of devotion laid up in Heaven, provide before hand a reserve of strength and mercy. Men in the course of their lives walk lazily and incuriously as if they had both their feet in one shoe, and when they are passively revolved to the time of their disso|lution they have no mercies in store, no pa|tience, no faith, no charity to God, or despite of the world, being without gust or appetite for the land of their inheritance, which Christ with so much pain and blood had purchased for them. When we come to die indeed, we shall be very much put to it to stand firm upon the two feet of a Christian, <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>patience.</HI> When we our selves are to use the articles, to turn our former discourses into present practise, and to feel what we never felt before, we shall finde it to be quite another thing to be willing presently to quit this life, and all our present possessions for the hopes of a thing which we were never suffered to see, and such a thing of which we may sail so many wayes, and of which if we fail any way we are mi|serable for ever. Then we shall finde how much we have need to have secured the Spirit of God, and the grace of saith by an habitual, perfect unmovable resolution. * The same also is the case of patience, which will be assault|ed with sharp pains, disturbed fancies, great fears, want of a present minde, natural weak|nesses, frauds of the Devil, and a thousand ac|cidents
<PB N="52" REF="55">
and imperfections. It concerns us therfore highly in the whole course of our lives, not onely to accustome our selves to a patient suffering of injuries and affronts, of persecutions and losses, of crosse accidents and unnecessary circumstances; but also by re|presenting death as present to us, to consider with what arguments then to fortifie our pa|tience; and by assiduous and fervent prayer to God, all our life long call upon God to give us patience, and great assistances, a strong faith and a confirmed hope, the Spirit of God, and his Holy Angels assistants at that time, to resist and to subdue the devils temptations and assaults; and so to fortifie our hearts that it break not into intolerable sorrows and impa|tience, and end in wretchlessenesse and infi|delity. * But this is to be the work of our life, and not to be done at once; but as God gives us time by succession, by parts and little periods. For it is very remarkable that God who giveth plenteously to all creatures, he hath scattered the firmament with stars as a man sowes corn in his fields, in a multitude bigger then the capacities of humane order; he hath made so much varietie of creatures, and gives us great choice of meats and drinks, although any one of both kindes would have served our needs; and so in all instances of nature; yet in the distribution of our time, God seems to be strait-handed, and gives it to us, not as Nature gives us Rivers, enough to drown us, but drop by drop, minute after minute, so that we never can have two minutes together, but he takes away one when he gives us another. This should teach us to va|lue our time, since God so values it, and by
<PB N="57" REF="55">
his so small distribution of it, tells us, it is the most precious thing we have. Since therefore in the day of our death, we can have but still the same little portion of this precious time, let us in every minute of our life, I mean, in every discernable portion lay up such a stock of reason and good works, that they may convey a value to the imperfect and short|er actions of our death-bed; while God re|wards the piety of our lives by his gracious acceptation and benediction, upon the actions preparatory to our death-bed.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>He that desires to die well and happily, above all things must be carefull, that he do not live a soft, a delicate and voluptuous life</HI>; but a life severe, holy, and under the discipline of the crosse; under the conduct of prudence and observation, a life of warfare and sober coun|sels, labour and watchfulnesse. No man wants cause of tears and a daily sorrow. Let every man consider what he feels and acknowledge his misery; let him confesse his sin and chastise it; let him bear his crosse patiently, and his per|secutions nobly, and his repentances willing|ly and constantly; let him pity the evils of all the world, and bear his share of the cala|mities of his Brother; let him long and sigh for the joyes of Heaven; let him tremble and fear because he hath deserved the pains of hell; let him commute his eternall fear with a temporall suffering, preventing Gods judge|ment by passing one of his own; let him groan for the labours of his pilgrimage, and the dangers of his warfare; and by that time he hath summed up all these labours; and du|ties, and contingencies, all the proper causes, instruments and acts of sorrow, he will finde,
<PB N="54" REF="56">
that for a secular joy and wantonnesse of spirit, there are not left many void spaces of his life. It was Saint <HI>Iames's</HI> advice;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ch 4. v 9</NOTE> <HI>Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep; let your laughter be turned in|to mourning, and your joy into weeping:</HI> And <HI>Bonaventure</HI> in the life of Christ, reports that the H.

<HEAD>SECT. II. Of daily examination of our actions, in the whole course of our health, preparatory to our death-bed.</HEAD>
<P>HE that will die well and happily, must dresse his soul by a diligent and frequent scrutiny: He must perfectly understand, and watch the state of his soul; he must set his house in order before he be fit to die. And for this there is great reason, and great neces|sity.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>Reasons for a daily examination.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. For if we consider the disorders of every day, the multitude of impertinent words, the great portions of time spent in vanity, the daily omissions of duty, the coldnesse of our prayers, the indifference of our spirit in holy things, the uncertainty of our secret
<PB N="56" REF="57">
purposes, our infinite deceptions and hypocri|sie, sometimes not known, very often not ob|served by our selves; our want of charity, our not knowing in how many degrees of action and purpose every vertue is to be exercised, the secret adherencies of pride, and too for|ward complacencie in our best actions, our failings in all our relations, the niceties of dif|ference between some vertues and some vices, the secret undiscernable passages from lawfull to unlawfull in the first instances of change, the perpetuall mistakings of permissions for duty, and licentious practises for permissions, our daily abusing the liberty that God gives us, our unsuspected sins in the managing a course of life certainly lawfull, our little gree|dinesses in eating, our surprises in the propor|tions of our drinkings, our too great freedoms and fondnesses in lawfull loves, our aptnesse for things sensual, and our deadnesse and te|diousnesse of spirit in spiritual employments, besides infinite variety of cases of conscience that do occur in the life of every man, and in all entercourses of every life, and that the productions of sin are numerous and in|creasing, like the families of the Northern people, or the genealogies of the first Patri|arks of the world; from all this we shall find that the computations of a mans life are buisie as the Tables of Signes and Tangents, and in|tricate as the accounts of Eastern Merchants: and therefore it were but reason we should summe up our accounts at the foot of every page, I mean, that we call our selves to scruti|ny every night when we compose our selves to the little images of Death.</P>
<P N="2">2. For if we make but one Generall ac|count,
<PB N="57" REF="57">
and never reckon till we die, either we shall onely reckon by great summes, and remember nothing but clamorous and crying sins, and never consider concerning particulars, or forget very many; or if we could consider all that we ought, we must needs be confoun|ded with the multitude and variety. But if we observe all the little passages of our life, and reduce them into the order of accounts and accusations, we shall finde them multiply so fast, that it will not onely appear to be an ease to the accounts of our death-bed, but by the instrument of shame will restrain the in|undation of evils; it being a thing intolera|ble to humane modesty to see sins increase so fast, and vertues grow up so slow; to see every day stained with the spots of leprosie, or sprinkled with the marks of a lesser evil.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is not intended, we should take ac|counts of our lives onely to be thought reli|gious, but that we may see our evil and amend it, that we dash our sins against the stones, that we may go to God, and to a spirituall Guide, and search for remedies and apply them. And indeed no man can well observe his own groweth in Grace, but by accounting seldomer returns of sin, and a more frequent victory over temptations; concerning which every man makes his observations according as he makes his inquiries and search after him|self: In order to this it was, that Saint <HI>Paul</HI> wrote; Before receiving the Holy Sacrament <HI>Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat.</HI> This precept was given in those dayes when they communicated every day, and therefore <HI>a daily examination</HI> also was intended.</P>
<P N="4">4. And it will appear highly fitting, if we
<PB N="58" REF="58">
remember that at the day of judgement, no onely the greatest lines of life, but every branch and circumstance of every action, eve|ry word, and thought shall be called to scruti|ny and severe judgement; insomuch that it was a great truth which one said; <HI>Wo be to the most Innocent life if God should search into it, without mixtures of mercy.</HI> And therefore we are here to follow S. <HI>Pauls</HI> advice; <HI>Iudge your selves and you shall not be judged of the Lord.</HI> The way to prevent Gods anger is to be angry with our selves, and by examining our acti|ons and condemning the Criminal, by being Assessors in Gods Tribunal, at least we shall obtain the favour of the Court. <HI>As therefore, every night we must make our bed the memoriall of our grave, so let our Evening thoughts be an image of the day of judgement.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. This advice was so reasonable and pro|per instrument of vertue, that it was taught even to the Scholers of <HI>Pythagoras</HI> by their Master:
<Q><HI>Let not sleep seiz upon the Regions of your senses, before you have three times recalled the conversation and accidents of the day:</HI> </Q>Ex|amine what you have committed against the Divine Law, what you have omitted of your duty, and in what you have made use of the Divine Grace to the purposes of vertue and religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hierocl.</NOTE> <HI>joyning the Iudge reason to the legisla|tive mind or conscience,</HI> that God may reigne there as a Law-giver and a Judge.
Then Christs kingdom is set up in our hearts; then we alwayes live in the Eye of our Judge, and live by the measures of reason, religion, and sober counsels.</P>
<P>The benefits we shall receive by practising
<PB N="59" REF="58">
this advice, in order to a blessed death, will also adde to the account of reason and fair inducements.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>The Benefits of this exercise.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. By a daily examination of our actions we shall the easier cure a great sin and pre|vent its arrival to become habitual. For [<HI>to examine</HI>] we suppose to be a relative duty and instrumentall to something else. We examine our selves that we may finde out our failings, and cure them: and therefore if we use our remedy when the wound is fresh and bleed|ing, we shall finde the cure more certain, and lesse painfull. For so a Taper when its crown of flames is newly blown off, retains a nature so symbolical to light, that it will with greedinesse reenkindle and snatch a ray from the neighbour fire: So is the soul of Man, when it is newly fallen into sin; although God be angry with it, and the state of Gods favour, and its own graciousnesse is interrupt|ed, yet the habit is not naturally changed; and still God leaves some roots of vertue stan|ding, and the Man is modest, or apt to be made ashamed, and he is not grown a bold sinner; but if he sleeps on it, and returns a|gain to the same sin, and by degrees growes in love with it, and gets the custome, and the strangenesse of it is taken away, then it is his Master, and is sweld into a heap, and is abet|ted by use, and corroborated by newly enter|tained principles, and is insinuated into his Nature, and hath possessed his affections, and tainted the will and the understanding; and by this time a man is in the state of a decay|ing
<PB N="60" REF="59">
Merchant, his accounts are so great, and so intricate, and so much in arrear, that to ex|amine it will be but to represent the particu|lars of his calamity: therefore they think it better to pull the napkin before their eyes, then to stare upon the circumstances of their death.</P>
<P N="2">2. A daily, or frequent examination of the parts of our life will interrupt the proceeding, and hinder the journey of little sins into a heap. For many dayes do not passe the best persons in which they have not many idle words, or vainer thoughts to sully the fair whitenesse of their souls: Some indiscreet passions, or trifling purposes, some imperti|nent discontents, or unhandsome usages of their own persons or their dearest Relatives. And though God <HI>is not extreme to mark what is done amisse,</HI> and therefore puts these upon the accounts of his Mercy, and the title of the Crosse, yet in two cases, these little sins combine and cluster; and we know that grapes were once in so great a bunch, that one cluster was the load of two men: that is, 1. When either we are in love with small sins; or 2. When they proceed from a carelesse and incurious spirit into frequency and continu|ance. For so the smallest atomes that dance in all the little cels of the world, are so tri|fling and immaterial that they cannot trouble an eye, nor vex the tenderest part of a wound where a barbed arrow dwelt; yet when by their infinite numbers (as <HI>Melissa</HI> and <HI>Par|menides</HI> affirm) they danced first into order, then into little bodies, at last they made the matter of the world: So are the little indis|cretions of our life; <HI>they are alwayes inconside|rable
<PB N="61" REF="59">
if they be considered, and contemptible if they be not despised, and God does not regard them if we do.</HI> We may easily keep them asunder by our daily or nightly thoughts, and pray|ers, and severe sentences: But even the least sand can check the tumultuous pride, and be|come a limit to the Sea, when it is in a heap and in united multitudes; but if the wind scatter and divide them, the little drops and the vainer froth of the water begins to invade the Strand. Our sighes can scatter such little offences; but then, be sure to breath such accents frequently, least they knot, and com|bine, and grow big as the shoar, and we <HI>pe|rish in sand,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecclus. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.1.</NOTE> in trifling instances. <HI>He that de|spiseth little things, shall perish by little and little.</HI> So said the son of <HI>Sirach.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. A frequent examination of our actions will intenerate and soften our consciences, so that they shall be impatient of any rudenesse or heavier load:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Qui levi commina|tione pellitur, non opus est ut fortitu|dine &amp; armis inva|datur. Senec.</NOTE> And he that is used to shrink when he is pressed with a branch of twining Osier, will not willingly stand in the ruines of a house, when the beam dashes upon the pavement. And, provided that our nice and tender spirit be not vexed into scruple, nor the scruple turn into unreasonable fears, nor the fears into superstition; he that by any arts can make his spirit tender, and apt for religious impressions, hath made the fairest seat for religion, and the unaptest and uneasi|est entertainment for sin, and eternal death, in the whole world.</P>
<P N="4">4. A frequent examination of the smallest parts of our lives is the best instrument to make our repentance particular, and a fit remedy
<PB N="62" REF="60">
to all the members of the whole body of sin. For our examination put off to our death-bed of necessity brings us into this condition, that very many thousands of our sins must be (or not be at al) washed off with a general repentance; which the more general and indefinite it is, it is ever so much the worse: And if he that repents the longest and the oftnest, and upon the most instances, is still during his whole life, but an imperfect penitent, and there are very many reserves left to be wiped off by Gods mercies, and to be eased by collateral assistances, or to be groaned for at the terrible day of judge|ment; it will be but a sad story to consider, that the sins of a whole life, or of very great portions of it, shall be put upon the remedy of one examination, and the advices of one discourse, and the activities of a decayed body, and a weak and an amazed Spirit. Let us do the best we can, we shall finde that the meer sins of ignorance, and unavoidable forgetful|nesse will be enough to be intrusted to such a bank, and that if a general repentance will serve towards their expiation, it will be an infinite mercy: but we have nothing to war|rant our confidence, if we shall think it to be enough on our death-bed to confesse the no|torious actions of our lives, (and to say [<HI>The Lord be merciful to me for the infinite transgressi|ons of my life, which I have wilfully or carelesly forgot</HI>] for very many of which, the repen|tance, the distinct, particular, circumstantiate repentance of a whole life would have been too little, if we could have done more.</P>
<P N="5">5. After the enumeration of these advan|tanges I shall not need to adde that if we de|cline or refuse to call our selves frequently to
<PB N="63" REF="60">
account, and to use daily advices concerning the state of our souls, it is a very ill signe, that our souls are not right with God, or that they do not dwell in religion. But this I shall say, that they who do use this exercise frequently will make their conscience much at ease by casting out a daily load of humor and surfet, the matter of diseases and the instruments of death. <HI>He that does not frequently search his con|science, is a house without a window,</HI> and like a wilde untutored son of a fond and undiscern|ing widow.</P>
<P>But if this exercise seem too great a trou|ble, and that by such advices, religion will seem a burden, I have two things to oppose against it.</P>
<P N="1">1. One is; that we had better <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ear the burden of the Lord, then the burden of a base and polluted conscience. Religion cannot be so great a trouble as a guilty soul; and what|soever trouble can be fancied in this or any other action of religion, it is onely to unex|perienced persons. It may be a trouble at first,<NOTE PLACE="marg">El<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ge vi|tam op|timam, consue|tudo fa|ciet ju|cundissi|mam. Senec.</NOTE> just as is every change, and every new accident: but if you do it frequently and ac|custom your spirit to it, as the custom will make it easy, so the advantages wil make it de|lectable; <HI>that</HI> will make it facile as nature, <HI>these</HI> will make it as pleasant and eligible as reward.</P>
<P N="2">2. The other thing I have to say is this: That to examine our lives will be no trouble if we do not intricate it with businesses of the world, and the Laby|rinths of care and im|pertinent affairs.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Securae &amp; quierae mentiae est in omnes vitae parte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> discurrere; occupatorum animi velut sub <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">go sunt, respicere non pos|sunt.

comes to search into all his actions, and to make judgement concerning his errors and his needs, his remedies and his hopes. <HI>They that have great intrigues of the world, have a yoak upon their necks, &amp; cannot look back</HI>; and he that covets many things greedily, and snatches at high things ambitiously, that despises his Neighbour proudly, and bears his crosses peevishly, or his prosperity impotently and passionately; he that is prodigal of his precious time, and is tenacious and retentive of evil purposes, is not a man disposed to this exercise, he hath reason to be afraid of his own memory, and to dash his glasse in pieces, because it must needs represent to his own eyes an intolerable deformity. He therefore that resolves to live well whatsoever it costs him; he that will go to Heaven at any rate, shall best tend this duty by neglecting the affairs of the world, in all things where prudently he may. But if we do otherwise, we shall finde that the accounts of our death-bed and the examination made by a disturbed understanding will be very empty of comfort and full of inconveniencies.</P>
<P N="6">6. For hence it comes that men dye so ti|morously, and uncomfortably, as if they were forced out of their lives by the violencies of an executioner. Then, <HI>without much examina|tion</HI> they remember how wickedly they have lived, without religion, against the laws of the covenant of grace, <HI>without God in the world</HI>; then they see sin goes off like an amazed, wounded, affrighted person from a lost battel, without honour, without a veil, with nothing but shame &amp; sad remembrances. Then they can consider that if they had lived vertuously, all the trouble and objection of that would now
<PB N="65" REF="61">
be past, and all that had remained should be peace and joy, and all that good which dwells within the house of God, and <HI>eternal life.</HI> But now they finde <HI>they have done amisse and dealt wickedly,</HI> they have no bank of good works, but a huge treasure of wrath, and they are going to a strange place, and what shall be their lot is uncertain; (so they say, when they would comfort and flatter themselves) but in truth of religion their portion is sad and intollerable, without hope, and without refreshment&punc; and they must use little silly arts, to make them go off from their stage of sins with some handsom circumstances of opinion: They will in civility be abused that they may die quietly, and go decently to their executi|on, and leave their friends indifferently con|tented, and apt to be comforted, and by that time they are gone awhile, they see that they deceived themselves all their dayes, and were by others deceived at last.</P>
<P>Let us make it our own case; we shall come to that state and period of condition, in which we shall be infinitely comforted, if we have lived well, er else be amazed and go off trem|bling, because we are guilty of heaps of un|repented and unforsaken sins. It may happen we shall not then understand it so, because most men of late ages have been abused with false principles, and they are taught (or they are willing to believe) that a little thing is enough to save them, and that heaven is so cheap a purchase, that it will fall upon them whether they will or no. The misery of it is, they will not suffer themselves to be confuted, till it be too late to recant their errour. In the <HI>interim,</HI> they are impatient to be examined,
<PB N="66" REF="62">
as a leper is of a comb, and are greedy of the world, as children of raw fruit; and they hate a severe reproof, as they do thorns in their beds; and they love to lay aside religion, as a drunken person does to forget his sorrow; and all the way they dream of fine things, and their dreams prove contrary, and become the hieroglyphics of an eternal sorrow. The daugh|ter of <HI>Polycrates</HI> dreamed that her Father was lifted up, and that <HI>Iupiter</HI> washed him and the Sun anointed him; but it proved to him but a sad prosperity: for after a long life of con|stant prosperous successes he was surpri|zed by his enemies, and hanged up till the dew of heaven wet his cheeks, and the Sun melted his grease. Such is the condition of those persons who living either in the de|spight, or in the neglect of religion, lye wal|lowing in the drunkennesse of prosperity, or worldly cares; they think themselves to be exalted, till the evil day overtakes them; and then they can expound their dream of life to end in a sad and hopelesse death. I re|member that <HI>Cleomenes</HI> that was called a God by the Egyptians, because when he was hang'd, a serpent grew out of his body, and wrapt it self about his head, till the Philosophers of Egypt said, it was natural that from the mar|row of some bodies such productions should arise: and indeed it represents the condition of some men, who being dead are esteemed saints and beatified persons when their head is encircled with dragons, and is entered into the possession of Devils, <HI>that old serpent and deceiver</HI>; For indeed their life was secretly so corrupted, that such serpents fed upon the ruines of the spirit, and the decayes of grace
<PB N="67" REF="62">
and reason. To be cosened in making judge|ments concerning our finall condition is ex|tremely easie, but if we be cosened, we are in|finitely miserable.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III. Of exercising Charity, during our whole life.</HEAD>
<P>HE that would die well and happily must in his life time according to all his capa|cities exercise charity; and because Religion is the life of the soul, and charity is the life of religi|on,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><L>Respice quid prodest praesenti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> temporis aevum,</L>
<L>Omne quod est, nihil est, prae|ter amare Deum.</L></NOTE> the same which gives life to the better part of man which never dies, may obtain of God a mercy to the inferiour part of man in the day of its dissolution.</P>
<P N="1">1. Charity is the great chanel through which God passes all his mercy upon man|kinde. For we receive absolution of our sins in proportion to our forgiving our brother: this is the rule of our hopes, and the measure of our desire in this world; and in the day of death and judgement the great sentence upon mankinde shall be transacted according to our almes, which is the other part of Charity. Cer|tain it is that God cannot, will not,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><L>Quod expendi habui,</L>

<L>Quod negavi punior,</L>
<L>Quod servavi perdidi.</L></NOTE> never did reject a charitable man in his greatest needs, and in his most passionate prayers; for <HI>God himself is love,</HI> and every degree of charity that dwells in us, is the participation
<PB N="68" REF="63">
of the divine nature; and therefore when upon our death-bed, a cloud covers our heads, and we are enwrapped with sorrow; when we feel the weight of a sicknesse, and do not feel the refreshing visitations of Gods loving kindnesse; when we have many things to trouble us, and looking round about us, we see no comforter; then call to minde what injuries you have forgiven, how apt you were to pardon all affronts and real persecutions? how you embraced peace when it was offered you? how you <HI>followed after peace,</HI> when it run from you? and when you are weary of one side, turn upon the other; and remember <HI>the alms,</HI> that by the grace of God, and his assistances you have done, and look up to God, and with the eye of faith behold him coming in the cloud, and pronouncing the sen|tence of dooms day according to his mercies and thy charity.</P>
<P N="2">2. Charity with its Twin-daughters, <HI>almes</HI> and <HI>forgivenesse</HI> is especially effectual for the procuring Gods mercies in the day and the manner of our death: <HI>almes deliver from death,</HI> said old <HI>Tobias,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tob. 4.10 &amp; 12.9.</NOTE> and <HI>almes make an atonement for sins,</HI> said the son of <HI>Sirach</HI>:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecclus. 2.30.</NOTE> and so said <HI>Daniel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. 4.</NOTE> and so say all the wise men of the world.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 4.8</NOTE> And in this sence also is that of <HI>S. Pe|ter, Love covers a multitude of sins</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isai 1.17.</NOTE> and <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Lib. 7. cap. 13. <GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE><HI>S. Cle|ment</HI> in his Constitutions gives this counsell; <HI>If you have any thing in your hands, give it that it may work to the remission of thy sins; for by faith and alms sins are purged.</HI> The same also is the counsel of <HI>Salvi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n,</HI> who wonders that men
<PB N="69" REF="63">
who are guilty of great and many sins, will not work out their pardon by alms and mercy. But this also must be added out of the words of <HI>Lactantius,</HI> who makes this rule compleat and useful; <HI>But think not, that because sins are taken away by alms, that by thy money thou mayest purchase a license to sin. For sins are abolished, if because thou hast sinned thou givest to God, that is,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Agere autem poeniten|tiam ni|hil aliud est quam pronteri &amp; affir|mare se non ulte|rius pec|caturum.</NOTE> to Gods poor servants and his indigent, ne|cessitous creature: But if thou sinnest upon confidence <HI>of giving,</HI> thy sins are not abolished. For God desires infinitely that men should be purged from their sins, and therefore com|mands us to repent, But to repent is nothing else, but to professe and affirm (that is, to pur|pose and to make good that purpose) that they will sin no more.</P>
<P>Now almes are therefore effective to the abolition and pardon of our sins, because they are preparatory <HI>to,</HI> and impetratory <HI>of</HI> the grace of repentance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Orat 2. de poeni|tentia.</NOTE> and are <HI>fruits of re|pentance</HI>; and therefore S. <HI>Chrysostom</HI> affirmes, that repentance without almes is dead, and without wings, and can never soar upwards to the element of love. But because they are a part of repentance, and hugely pleasing to Almighty God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nun|quam memmi melegisse mala morte mortu|um qui libenter opera charitatis exercuit. ad Nepo.</NOTE> therefore they deliver us from the evils of an unhappy and accursed death; for so Christ delivered his Disciples from the sea, when he appeased the storm, though they still sailed in the chanel: and this S. <HI>Hierome</HI> verifies with all his reading and experience, saying, <HI>I do not remember to have read, that ever any charitable person died an evil death:</HI> and al|though a long experience hath observed Gods mercies to descend upon charitable people like the dew upon <HI>Gideons</HI> fleece when all the

<P>I do not mean this should onely be a death-bed charity, any more then a death-bed re|pentance; but it ought to be the charity of our life, &amp; healthfull years;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><L>Da dum tempus habes, tibi propria sit manus haeres;</L>

<HEAD>The circumstances of a dying mans sorrow and danger.</HEAD>
<P>When the sentence of death is decreed, and begins to be put in execution, it is sorrow enough to see or feel respectively the sad ac|cidents of the agony, and last contentions of the soul, and the reluctancies and unwilling|nesses of the body. The forehead wash'd with a new and stranger baptisme, besmeared with a cold sweat, tenacious and clammy, apt to make it cleave to the roof of his coffin; the nose cold and undiscerning, not pleased with perfumes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nilus.</NOTE> nor suffering violence with a cloud of unwholsome smoak; the eyes dim as a sullied mirror, or the face of heaven, when God shews his anger in a prodigious storm; the feet cold, the hands stiffe, the Physitians despairing, our friends weeping, the rooms dressed with darknesse and sorrow, and the exteriour parts betraying what are the
<PB N="73" REF="65">
violences which the soul and spirit suffer;<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Basil.</NOTE> the nobler part like the lord of the house, being assaulted by exteriour rudenesses, and driven from all the out-works; at last, faint and wea|ry, with short and frequent breathings, inter|rupted with the longer accents of sighes, without moisture, but the excrescencies of a spilt humour, when the pitcher is broken at the cisterne; it retires to its last sort, <HI>the heart,</HI> whither it is pursued and stormed, and bea|ten out, as when the barbarous Thracian sack|ed the glory of the Grecian Empire. Then ca|lamity is great, and sorrow rules in all the capacities of man: then the mourners weep, because it is civil, or because they need thee, or because they fear, but who suffers for thee with a compassion sharp as is thy pain? Then the noise is like the faint eccho of a distant val|ley, &amp; few heare, and they will not regard <HI>thee,</HI> who seemest like a person void of understand|ing, and of a departing interest. <HI>Ver&egrave; tremen|dum est mortis sacramentum.</HI> But these acci|dents are common to all that die, and when a speciall providence shall distinguish them, they shall die with easie circumstances; but as no piety can secure it, so must no confi|dence expect it, but wait for the time, and ac|cept the manner of the dissolution. But that which distinguishes them is this.</P>
<P>He that hath lived a wicked life, if his conscience be alarmed, and that he does not die like a Wolf, or a Tigre without sense or remorse of all his wildnesse, and his injury, his beastly nature, and desert, and untilled manners, if he have but sense of what he is going to suffer, or what he may expect to be his portion, then we may imagine the terrour
<PB N="74" REF="66">
of their abused fancies, how they see affright|ing shapes, and because they fear them, they feel the gripes of Devils, urging the unwil|ling souls from the kinder and fast embraces of the body, calling to the grave, and hasting to judgement, exhibiting great bills of un|cancelled crimes, awaking and amazing the conscience, breaking all their hope in pieces, and making faith uselesse and terrible, be|cause the malice was great and the charity was none at all.<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Chry|sostomus.</NOTE> Then <HI>they look for some to have pity on them, but there is no man.</HI> No man dares be their pledge, <HI>No man can redeem their soul,</HI> which now feels what it never feared. Then the tremblings and the sorrow, the me|mory of the past sin, and the fear of future pains, and the sense of an angry God, and the presence of some Devils consigne him to the eternall company of all the damned and accur|sed spirits:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ephraem Syrus.</NOTE> then they want an Angel for their guide, and the Holy Spirit for their comfor|ter, and a good conscience for their testimony, and Christ for their Advocate, and they die and are left in prisons of earth or air, in secret and undiscerned regions to weep and tremble, and infinitely to fear the coming of the day of Christ; at which time they shall be brought forth to change their condition into a worse, where they shall for ever feel more then we can beleeve or understand.</P>
<P>But when a good man dies; one that hath lived innocently or made <HI>joy in Heaven</HI> at his timely and effective repentance, and in whose behalf the Holy Jesus hath interceded prospe|rously, and for whose interest the Spirit makes interpellations with groans and sighs unutte|rable, and in whose defence the Angels drive
<PB N="75" REF="66">
away the Devils on his death-bed, because his sins are pardoned, and because he resisted the Devil in his life time, and fought suc|cessefully, and persevered unto the end, then the joyes break forth through the clouds of sicknesse, and the conscience stands upright, and confesses the glories of God, and owns so much integrity that it can hope for pardon, and obtain it too: Then the sorrowes of the sicknesse, and the flames of the Feaver, or the faintnesse of the consumption do but untye the soul from its chain, and let it go forth, first into liberty, and then to glory; for it is but for a little while that the face of the skie was black, like the preparations of the night, but quickly the cloud torn and rent, the violence of thunder parted it into little portions, that the Sun might look forth with a watry eye, and then shine without a tear; but it is an infinite refreshment to remember all the comforts of his prayers, the frequent victory over his temptations, the mortifica|tion of his lust, the noblest sacrifice to God in which he most delights, that we have given him our wills, and killed our appeti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es for the interest of his services; then all the trouble of that is gone, and what remains is a portion in the inheritance of Jesus, of which he now talks no more as a thing at distance, but is entring into the possession. When the veil is rent, and the prison doors are open at the presence of Gods Angel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Mar|tyrius. S. Eustra|tius Mar|tyr.</NOTE> the soul goes forth full of hope, sometimes with evidence, but alwayes with certainty in the thing, and in|stantly it passes into the throngs of Spirits, where Angles meet it singing, and the Devils flock with malitious and vile purposes, desiring
<PB N="76" REF="67">
to lead it away with them into their houses of sorrow; there they see things which they never saw, and hear voices which they never heard: There the Devils charge them with many sins; And the Angels remember that themselves rejoyced when they were repented of. Then the Devils aggravate and describe all the circumstances of the sin, and adde calum|nies, and the Angels bear the soul forward still, because their Lord doth answer for them: Then the Devils rage and gnash their teeth:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chryso|stomus.</NOTE> they see the soul chast and pure, and they are ashamed; they see it penitent, and they de|spair; they perceive that the tongue was re|strained and sanctified, and then hold their peace: Then the soul passes forth and re|joyces, passing by the Devils in scorn and triumph, being securely carried into the bo|some of the Lord, where they shall rest till their crowns are finished, and their mansions are prepared, and then they shall feast and sing, rejoyce and worship for <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. Philo.</NOTE> ever and ever. Fearful and formidable to unholy per|sons is the first meeting with spirits in their se|paration. But the victory which holy souls re|ceive by the mercies of Jesus Christ, and the conduct of Angels is a joy that we must not understand till we feel it: and yet such which by an early and a persevering piety we may secure: but let us enquire after it no further, because it is secret.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the state of sicknesse, and the temptations incident to it with their proper remedies.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I. Of the state of sicknesse.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ADams</HI> sin brought death into the world, and man did die the same day in which he sinned, according as God had threatned: He did not die, as death is taken for a sepa|ration of soul and body; that is not death properly; but the ending of the last act of death: just as a man is said to be <HI>born,</HI> when he ceases any longer to be <HI>born</HI> in his mothers womb. But whereas to man was intended a life long and happy, without sicknesse, sorrow or infelicity, and this life should be lived here or in a better place, and the passage from one to the other should have been easy, safe and pleasant, now that man sinned, he fell from that state to a contrary.</P>
<P>If <HI>Adam</HI> had stood he should <HI>not alwayes</HI> have lived in this world; for this world was
<PB N="78" REF="68">
not a place capable of giving a dwelling to all those myriads of men and women which should have been born in all the generations of infinite and eternal ages; for so it must have been, if man had not dyed at all, nor yet have removed hence at all: Neither is it likely that mans innocence should have lost to him all possibility of going thither, where the duration is better, measured by a better time, subject to fewer changes, and which is now the reward of a returning vertue, which in all natural senses is lesse then innocence, save that it is heightned by Christ to an equality of acceptation with the state of innocence: But so it must have been, that his innocence should have been punished with an eternal confinement to this state, which in all reason is the lesse perfect, the state of a traveller, not of one possessed of his inheritance. It is there|fore certain Man should have changed his abode: for so did <HI>Enoch,</HI> and so did <HI>Elias,</HI> and so shall all the world that shall be alive at the day of judgement: <HI>They shall not die, but they shall change</HI> their place, and their abode, their duration and their state, and all this without death.</P>
<P>That death therefore which God threatned to <HI>Adam</HI> and which passed upon his posterity, is not the going out of this world, but <HI>the manner of going.</HI> If he had staid in innocence, he should have gone from hence placidly, and fairly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prima quae vi|tam de|dit, hora carpsit. Hercul. Tur.</NOTE> without vexatious and afflictive circum|stances; he should not have dyed by sickness, misfortune, defect, or unwillingnesse; but when he fell, then he began to die; <HI>the same day,</HI> (so said God:) and that must needs be true: and therefore it must mean, that upon
<PB N="79" REF="68">
that very day he fell into an evil and danger|ous condition; a state of change and afflicti|on;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nascen|tes me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> rimur si|nis&abque; ab origine pendet. Manil.</NOTE> then death began, that is, the man began to die by a natural diminution, and aptnesse to disease and misery. His first state was and should have been (so long as it lasted) a hap|py duration; His second was a daily and mi|serable change; and this was the dying pro|perly.</P>
<P>This appears in the great instance of <HI>dam|nation,</HI> which in the stile of Scripture is called eternal death; not because it kills or ends the duration; it hath not so much good in it; but because it is a perpetual infelicity, Change or separation of soul and body is but acci|dental to death. Death may be with, or with|out either: but the formality, the curse and the sting of death, that is, misery, sorrow, fear, diminution, defect, anguish, dishonour, and whatsoever is miserable, and afflictive in nature, that is death: death is not an action, but a whole state and condition; and this was first brought in upon us by the offence of one man.</P>
<P>But this went no further then thus to sub|ject us to temporal infelicity. If it had pro|ceeded so as was supposed, Man had been much more miserable; for man had more then one original sin in this sence: and though this death entred first upon us by <HI>Adams</HI> fault, yet it came neerer unto us, and increased upon us by the sins of more of our forefathers. For <HI>Adams</HI> sin left us in strength enough to contend with humane calamities for almost a thousand years together. But the sins of his children, our forefathers, took off from us half the strength about the time of the flood;
<PB N="80" REF="69">
and then from 500. to 250. and from thence to 120. and from thence to threescore and ten, so halfing it, till it is almost come to no|thing. But by the sins of men in the several generations of the world, <HI>death,</HI> that is, mi|sery and disease, is hastned so upon us, that we are of a contemptible age; and because we are to die by suffering evils, and by the daily lessening of our strength and health; this death is so long a doing, that it makes so great a part of our short life uselesse and unservicea|ble, that we have not time enough to get the perfection of a single manufacture; but ten or twelve generations of the world must go to the making up of one wise man, or one ex|cellent Art: and in the succession of those ages, there happens so many changes and in|terruptions, so many warres and violencies, that seven years fighting sets a whole Kingdom back in learning and vertue, to which they were creeping, it may be, a whole age.</P>
<P>And thus also we do evil to our posterity, as <HI>Adam</HI> did to his, and <HI>Cham</HI> did to his, and <HI>Eli</HI> to his, and all they to theirs, who by sins caused God to shorten the life, and multiply the evils of mankinde: and for this reason it is, the world grows worse and worse, because so many original sins are multiplied, and so many evils from Parents descend upon the succeeding generations of men, that they de|rive nothing from us but original misery.</P>
<P>But he who restored the law of Nature, did also restore us to the condition of Nature; which being violated by the introduction of death, Christ then repaired when he suffered and overcame death for us: that is, he hath ta|ken away the unhappinesse of sicknesse, and
<PB N="81" REF="69">
the sting of death, and the dishonours of the grave, of dissolution and weaknesse, of decay and change; and hath turned them into acts of favour, into instances of comfort, into op|portunities of vertue; Christ hath now knit them into rosaries, and coronets, he hath put them into promises and rewards, he hath made them part of the portion of his elect; they are <HI>instruments,</HI> and <HI>earnests,</HI> and <HI>securi|ties,</HI> and <HI>passages</HI> to the greatest perfection of humane nature, and the Divine promises. So that it is possible for us now to be reconci|led to sicknesse; <HI>It came in by sin, and there|fore is cured when it is turned into vertue</HI>; and although it may have in it the uneasinesse of labour, yet it will not be uneasie as sin, or the restlessenesse of a discomposed conscience: If therefore we can well manage our state of sicknesse, <HI>that we may not fall by pain, as we usually do by pleasure,</HI> we need not fear; for no evil shall happen to us.</P>

Sighes and groans, sorrow and prayers, humble complaints, and dolorous expressi|ons are the sad accents of a sick mans lan|guage;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Biulatu, questu, gemitu, fremiti|bus reso nando multum flebiles voces <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">efert. Cic. sus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> for it is not to be expected that a sick man should act a part of patience with a countenance like an Orator, or grave like a Dramatick person. It were well if all men could bear an exteriour decencie in their sicknesse, and regulate their voice, their face, their discourse, and all their circumstances by the measures, and proportions of comlinesse and satisfaction to all the standers by. But this would better please them then assist him; the sick man would do more good to others, then he would receive to himself.</P>
<P N="2">2. Therefore, silence and still composures, and not complaining, are no parts of a sick mans duty; they are not necessary parts of patience:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cones|d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ndu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> es<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ge|menti.</NOTE> We find that <HI>David roared for the very disquietnesse of his sicknesse</HI>; and he lay <HI>chattering like a swallow,</HI> and <HI>his throat was dry</HI> with calling for help upon his God. Thats the proper voice of sicknesse; and certain it is, that the proper voyces of sicknesse are ex|pressely <HI>vocal,</HI> and <HI>petitory</HI> in the eares of God, and call for pity in the same accent, as the cryes and oppressions of Widows and Orphans do for vengeance upon their persecutors, though they say no Collect against them. For there is <HI>the voyce of man,</HI> and there is <HI>the voyce of the disease,</HI> and God hears both; And the louder the disease speaks, there is the greater need of mercy and pity, and therefore God will the sooner hear it. <HI>Abels blood had a voice</HI> and cried to God, and <HI>humility hath a voice</HI>
<PB N="83" REF="70">
and cries so loud to God, that <HI>it pierces the clouds</HI>; and so hath every sorrow, and every sicknesse: and when a man cries out, and complains but according to the sorrowes of his pain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">&mdash;Flagrantior aequo Non debet dolor esse viri nec vulnere major. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u. Sat. 13.</NOTE> it cannot be any part of a culpable impatience, but an argument for pity.</P>
<P N="3">3. Some senses are so subtile, and their perceptions so quick and full of relish, and their spirits so active, that the same load is double upon them, to what it is to another person; and therefore comparing the expres|sions of the one to the silence of the other, a different judgement cannot be made concern|ing their patience: Some natures are queru|lous, and melancholy, and soft, and nice, and tender, and weeping, and expressive; others are sullen, dull, without apprehension, apt to tolerate and carry burdens; and the crucifix|ion of our Blessed Saviour falling upon a de|licate and virgin body, of curious temper, and strict, equall composition, was naturally more full of torment then that of the ruder theeves, whose proportions were course<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and uneven.</P>
<P N="4">4. In this case it was no imprudent ad|vice which <HI>Cicero</HI> gave: No|thing in the world is more a|miable then an even temper in our whole life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Omnino si qu equ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m est do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> nihil est pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ero <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, qua <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> singula|rium <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">: quam <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> con e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vare non nossis si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a io<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">um naturam imitans <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">.</NOTE> and in eve|ry action: but this evennesse cannot be kept unlesse every man follows his own nature, without striving to i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itate the circumstances of another: and what is so in the thing it self, ought to be so in our

judgements concerning the things. We must not call any one impatient if he be not silent in a feaver as if he were asleep, or as if he were dull, as <HI>Herods</HI> son of Athens.</P>
<P N="5">5. Nature in some cases hath made cry|ings out, and exclamations to be an enter|tainment of the spirit, and an abatement or diversion of the pain. For so did the old champions when they threw their fatall nets that they might load their enemy with the snares and weights of death, they groaned aloud,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quiapro|fundenda voce om|ne cor|pus in|tenditur venit&abque; plaga vehe|mentior. Cic.

Nothing of this is a certain <HI>signe,</HI> much lesse <HI>an action</HI> or <HI>part</HI> of impatience; and when our blessed Saviour suffered his last, and sharp|est pang of sorrow, <HI>he cryed out with a loud voice,</HI> and resolved to die, and did so.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III. Constituent or integrall parts of patience.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THat we may secure our patience, we must take care that <HI>our complaints be without despair.</HI> Despair sins against the repu|tation
<PB N="85" REF="71">
of Gods goodnesse, and the efficacy of all our old experience: By despair we de|stroy the greatest comfort of our sorrowes, and turn our sicknesse into the state of Devils, and perishing souls. No affliction is greater then despair, for that is it which makes hell fire, and turns a natural evil into an intole|rable; it hinders prayers, and fills up the in|tervalls of sicknesse with a worse torture; it makes all spiritual arts uselesse, and the office of spiritual comforters and guides to be imper|tinent.</P>
<P>Against this, <HI>hope</HI> is to be opposed; and its proper acts as it relates to the vertue and exercise of patience are; 1 Praying to God for help and remedy; 2 sending for the guides of souls; 3. using all holy exercises and acts of grace, proper to that state; which who so does hath not the impatience of despair; every man that is patient hath hope in God in the day of his sorrows.</P>
<P N="2">2. Our complaints in sicknesse must be <HI>without murmure.</HI> Murmur sins against Gods providence and government: by it we grow rude, and like the falling Angels, displeased at Gods supremacy: and nothing is more un|reasonable: it talks against God, for whose glory all speech was made; it is proud and phantastic, hath better opinions of a sinner then of the Divine justice, and would rather accuse God then himself.</P>
<P>Against this is opposed that part of patience which resignes the man into the hands of God; saying with old <HI>Eli, It is the Lord, let him do what he will</HI>; and [<HI>Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven</HI>] and so by admiring Gods justice and wisdom, does also dispose the sick
<PB N="86" REF="72">
person for receiving Gods mercy; and se|cures him the rather in the grace of God. The proper acts of this part of patience are, 1. To confesse our sins and our own demerits. 2. It increases and exercises humility. 3. It loves to sing praises to God, even from the lowest abysse of humane misery.</P>
<P N="3">3. Our complaints in sicknesse must be <HI>without peevishnesse.</HI> This sins against civility, and that necessary decency, which must be used toward the ministers and assistants. By peevishnesse we increase our own sorrowes, and are troublesome to them that stand there to ease ours. It hath in it harshnesse of nature, and ungentlenesse, wilfulnesse, and Phantastic opinions, morosity and incivility.</P>
<P>Against it are opposed obedience, tracta|bility, easinesse of persuasion, aptnesse to take counsel. The acts of this part of patience are, 1. To obey our Physitians. 2. To treat our persons with respect to our present necessi|ties.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vide chap. 4. Sect. 1.</NOTE> 3. Not to be ungentle, and uneasy to the ministers, and nurses that attend us; But to take their diligent and kinde offices as sweetly as we can, and to bear their indiscre|tions, or unhandsome accidents contentedly, and without disquietnesse within, or evil lan|guage, or angry words without. 4. Not to use unlawful means for our recovery.</P>
<P>If we secure these particulars, we are not lightly to be judged of, by noises and postures, by colours and images of things, by palenesse, or tossings from side to side. For it were a hard thing that those persons who are loa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en with the greatnesse of humane calamities, should be strictly tyed to ceremonies and forms of things.

<HEAD>SECT. IV. Remedies against impatience, by way of consideration.</HEAD>
<P>AS it happens concerning death, so it is in sicknesse which is death<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> handmaid. It hath the fate to suffer calumny and reproach, and hath a name worse th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n its nature.</P>
<P N="1">1. For there is no sicknesse so great but children endure it, and have natural strengths to bear them out quite through the calamity, what period soever nature hath allotted it. Indeed they make no reflexions upon their sufferings and complain of sicknesse with an uneasy sigh, or a natural groan, but consider not what the sorrows of sicknesse mean; and so bear it by a direct sufferance, and as a pillar bears the weight of a roof: But then why cannot we bear it so to? For this which we call a reflexion upon, or a considering of our sicknesse, is nothing but a perfect instrument
<PB N="88" REF="73">
of trouble, and consequently a temptation to impatience. It serves no end of nature, it may be avoided, and we may consider it onely as an expression of Gods Anger, and an emis|sary, or procurator of repentance. But all other considering it, except where it serves the purposes of medicine and art,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><L>Praetulerim delyrus iners&abque; vi|deri,</L>
<L>Dum mea delectant mala me, vel denique fallant,</L>
<L>Quam sapere &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ingi.</L>
<BIBL>Hor. lib. 2. ep. 2.</BIBL></NOTE> is nothing, but un|der the colour of reason, an unreasonable device to heighten the sicknesse, and increase the torment. But then, children want this act of reflex perception, or reasonable sense whereby their sicknesse becomes lesse pungent and dolorous; so also do they want the helps of reason, whereby they should be able to support it. For certain it is, reason was as well given us to harden our spirits and stiffen them in passions and sad accidents, as to make us bending and apt for action: and if in men God hath heightned the faculties of appre|hension, he hath increased the auxiliaries of reasonable strengths; that Gods rod, and Gods staffe might go together, and the beam of Gods countenance may as well refresh us with its light, as scorch us with its heat. But poor chil|dren that endure so much, have not inward supports and refreshments to bear them through it; they never heard the sayings of old men, nor have been taught the principles of severe philosophy, nor are assisted with the results of a long experience, nor know they how to turn a sicknesse into vertue, and a Fea|ver into a reward; nor have they any sense of fa|vors, the remembrance of which may alleviate their burden; and yet nature hath in them teeth
<PB N="89" REF="73">
and nails enough to scratch, and fight against the sickness, and by such aids as God is pleased to give them, they wade thorough the storm, and murmur not: and besides this yet, al|though infants have not such brisk perceptions upon the stock of reason, they have a more tender feeling upon the accounts of sense, and their flesh is as uneasy by their natural softnesse and weak shoulders, as ours by our too forward apprehensions. Therefore bear up: either you or I, or some man wiser,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><L><GAP DESC="foreign"></L>

<P>That sorrow is hugely tolerable which gives its smart but by instants and smallest propor|tions of time. No man at once feels the sick|nesse of a week, or of a whole day; but the smart of an instant: and still every portion of a minute, feels but its proper share; and the last groan ended all the sorrow of its peculiar burden: and what minute can that be, which can pretend to be intolerable? and the next minute is but the same as the last: and the pain flowes like the drops of a river, or the little shreds of time: and if we do but take care of the present minute, it cannot seem a great charge, or a great burden; but that care will secure our duty, if we still will but secure the present minute.</P>
<P N="3">3. If we consider how much men can suffer if they list, and how much they do suffer for great and little causes, and that no causes are greater then the proper causes of patience in
<PB N="90" REF="74">
sicknesse (that is necessity and religion) we cannot without huge shame to our nature, to our persons, and to our manners complain of this tax and impost of nature. This experi|ence added something to the old Philosophy. When the Gladiators were exposed naked to each others short swords, and were to cut each others souls away in portions of flesh, as if their forms had been as divisible as the life of worms:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spectato|res voci|ferantur, ictus ta|cet.</NOTE> they did not sigh or groan, it was a shame to decline the blow, but according to the just measures art. The women that saw the wounds shrike out; and he that receives it holds his peace.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Qui mediocris gladiator inge|muit? Quis vultum mutavit unquam? Quis non modo sterit, verum etiam decubuit turpiter? Tusc. Qu. lib. 2.</NOTE> They did not only stand bravely, but would also fall so; and when he was down, scorn'd to shrink his head, when the insolent conquerer came to lift it from his shoulders: and yet this man in his first designe, onely aimed at liberty, and the reputation of a good fencer; and when he sunk down, he saw he could onely receive the honour of a bold man; the noise of which he shall never hear, when his ashes were crammed in his narrow Urne. And what can we complain of the weaknesse of our strengths, or the pressures of diseases, when we see a poor souldier stand in a breach almost starved with cold and hunger; and his cold apt to be relieved onely by the heats of An|ger, a Feaver of a fired musket? and his hun|ger slacked by a greater pain, and a huge fear? this man shall stand in his arms and wounds, <HI>patiens liminis at&abque; solis,</HI> pale and faint, weary and watchful; and at night shall have a bullet pulled out of his flesh, and shivers from his
<PB N="91" REF="74">
bones, and endure his mouth to be sewed up from a violent rent to its own dimension, and all this for a man whom he never saw, or if he did, was not noted by him; but one that shall condemn him to the gallows if he runs from all this misery. It is seldome that God sends such calamities upon men, as men bring upon themselves, and suffer willingly. But that which is most considerable, is, that any passion and violence upon the spirit of man makes him able to suffer huge calamities, with a cer|tain constancy and an unwearied patience. <HI>Scipio Africanus</HI> was wont to commend that saying in <HI>Xenophon,</HI> that the same labours of warfare were easier far to a General then to a common souldier, because he was supported by the huge appetites of honour, which made his hard marches nothing but steppings for|ward, and reaching at a triumph. Did not the Lady of <HI>Sabinus</HI> for others interest bear twins privately and without groaning? Are not the labours and cares, the spare diet, and the waking nights of covetous and adulterous, of ambitious and revengful persons, greater sorrowes and of more smart then a Feaver, or the short pains of childebirth? what will not render women suffer to hide their shame? And if vice, and passion, lust, and inferi|our appetites can supply to the tenderest persons strengths more then enough, for the sufferance of the greatest natural violences, can we suppose that honesty and religion, and the grace of God are more nice, tender, and effeminate?</P>
<P N="4">4. Sicknesse is the more tolerable because it cures very many evils, and takes away the sense of all the crosse fortunes which amaze
<PB N="92" REF="75">
the spirits of some men, and transport them certainly beyond all the limits of patience. Here all losses and disgraces, domestick cares and publick evils, the apprehensions of pity, and a sociable calamity, the fears of want and the troubles of ambition, lie down and rest upon the sick mans pillow. One fit of the stone takes away from the fancies of men, all rela|tions to the world and secular interests; at least they are made dull and flat, without sharpnesse and an edge.</P>
<P>And he that shall observe the infinite va|riety of troubles which afflicts some busie per|sons, &amp; almost all men in very busie times, will think it not much amisse that those huge num|bers were reduced to certainty, to method, and an order; and there is no better com|pendium for this, then that they be reduced to one. And a sick man seems so unconcern|ed in the things of the world, that although this separation be done with violence; yet it is no otherwise then all noble contentions are, and all honours are purchased, and all vertues are acquired, and all vices mortified, and all appetites chastised, and all rewards obtained: there is infallibly to all these a difficulty and a sharpnesse annexed, without which there could be no proportion between a work and a reward. To this adde, that sicknesse does not take off the sense of secular troubles, and worldly cares from us, by imploying all the perceptions, and apprehensions of men, by filling all faculties with sorrow, and lea|ving no room for the lesser instances of trou|bles; as little rivers are swallowed up in the Sea: But sicknesse is a messenger of God,
<PB N="93" REF="75">
sent with purposes of abstraction and separati|on, with a secret power and a proper effica|cie to draw us off from unprofitable and use|lesse sorrows: and this is effected <HI>partly</HI> by reason that it represents the uselessnesse of the things of this world, and that there is a portion of this life in which honours and things of the world cannot serve us to many purposes, partly by preparing us to death, and telling us that a man shall descend thither whence this world cannot redeem us, &amp; where the goods of this world cannot serve us.</P>
<P N="5">5. And yet after all this, sicknesse leaves in us appetites so strong, and apprehensions so sensible, and delights so many, and good things in so great a degree, that a healthlesse body,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Debilona facito|manu de|bilem pe|de, coxa, lubricos quato dentes, vita dun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> superest, bene est.</NOTE> and a sad disease do seldome make men weary of this world; but still they would fain find an excuse to live. The gout, the stone, and the toothach, the <HI>sciatica,</HI> sore eyes, and an aking head, are evils indeed; But such, which rather then die, most men are willing to suffer, and <HI>Mecenas</HI> added also a wish, ra|ther to be crucified then to die; and though his wish was low, timerous, and base, yet we find the same desires in most men, dressed up with better circumstances.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hanc mi|hi, vol acuta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, si das, su|stineo crucem. Sen. ep. 101.</NOTE> It was a cruell mercy in <HI>Tamerlan</HI> who commanded all the leprous persons to be put to death, as we knock some beasts quickly on their head, to put them out of pain, and lest they should live miserably. The poor men would rather have endured another leprosie, and have more willingly taken two diseases then one death; therefore <HI>Caesar</HI> wondred that the old crazed souldier that begged leave he might kill him|self, and asked him, <HI>Doest thou think then to be
<PB N="94" REF="76">
more alive then now thou art?</HI> We do not die suddenly, but we descend to death by steps, and slow passages; and therefore men (so long as they are sick) are unwilling to pro|ceed and go forward in the finishing that sad imployment. Between a disease and death, there are many degrees, and all those are like the reserves of evil things, the declining of every one of which is justly reckoned amongst those good things, which alleviate the sick|nesse and make it tolerable. Never account that sicknesse intolerable, in which thou hadst rather remaine, then die: And yet if thou hadst rather die then suffer it, the worst of it that can be said is this, that this sicknesse is worse then death; that is, it is worse then that which is the best of all evils, and the end of all troubles; and then you have said no great harme against it.</P>
<P N="6">6. Remember that thou art under a su|pervening necessity. <HI>Nothing is intolerable that is necessary</HI>; and therefore when men are to suffer a sharp incision, or what they are plea|sed to call <HI>intolerable,</HI> tie the man down to it, and he endures it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Impro|baeque Tigres indul|gent pa|tientiam flagello.</NOTE> Now God hath bound this sicknesse upon thee by the condition of Nature (for every flower must wither and droop) it is also bound upon thee by spe|ciall providence, and with a designe to try thee, and with purposes to reward and to crown thee. These cords thou canst not break; and therefore lie thee down gently, and suffer the hand of God to do what he please,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Impiger &amp; fortis virtute coacta.</NOTE> that at least thou mayest swallow an advantage, which the care and severe mer|cies of God forces down thy throat.</P>
<P N="7">7. Remember that all men have passed

<L>Thessaliae&abque; rogos &amp; funera gentis Iberae.</L></NOTE> the bravest, the wisest, &amp; the best men, have bin subject to sicknes &amp; sad diseases; and it is esteemed a prodigy, that a man should live to a long age and not be sick: and it is recorded for a won|der concerning <HI>Xenophilus</HI> the Musitian, that he lived to 106 years of age in a perfect and continual health: No story tells the like of a Prince, or a great or a wise person;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rara est in nobi|litate se|nectu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erre quam sor|tem pa|tiuntur omnes nemo re|cusat.</NOTE> unlesse we have a minde to believe the tales concerning <HI>Nestor</HI> and the <HI>Euboean Sibyl.</HI> Old age and healthfull bodies are seldome made the appen|dages to great fortunes: and under so great, and so universal precedents, so common fate of men, he that will not suffer his portion, deserves to be something else then a man, but nothing that is better.</P>
<P N="8">8. We finde in story that many Gentiles who walked by no light but that of reason, opinion, and humane examples, did bear their sicknesse nobly, and with great contempt of pain, and with huge interests of vertue. When <HI>Pompey</HI> came from Syria and called at Rhodes, to see <HI>Posidonius</HI> the Philosopher, he found him hugely afflicted with the gout, and expressed his sorrow, that he could not hear his Lectures from which by this pain he must needs be hindred. <HI>Posidonius</HI> told him, <HI>but you may hear me for all this</HI>; and he discours'd excellently in the midst of his tortures, even then,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tusc. l. 2.

<PB N="96" REF="77">
as I can honestly bear thee.</HI> And when <HI>Pompey</HI> himself was desperately sick at Naples, the <HI>Neopolitans</HI> wore crowns and triumphed; and the men of <HI>Puteoli</HI> came to congratulate his sicknesse, not because they loved him not, but because it was the custome of their coun|trey to have better opinions of sicknesse then we have. The boyes of <HI>Sparta</HI> would at their Altars endure whipping till their very entrails saw the light thorow their torn flesh; and some of them to death, without crying or complaint. <HI>Caesar</HI> would drink his potions of Rhubarb rudely mixt, and unfitly allayed with little sippings, and tasted the horror of the medicine spreading the loathsomnesse of his physick so, that all the parts of his tongue and palate might have an intire share: and when <HI>C.

<P N="10">10. Remember that this sicknesse is but for a short time; If it be sharp it will not last long; If it be long, it will be easie and very tolerable. And although S. <HI>Eadsine</HI> Archbi|shop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> had twelve years of sick|nesse, yet all that while he ruled his Church

<P>THe fittest instrument of esteeming sick|nesse easily tolerable, is to remember that which indeed makes it so; and that is, that God doth minister proper aids and sup|ports to every of his servants whom he visits with his rod. He knows our needs, he pities our sorrows, he relieves our miseries, he supports our weaknesse, he bids us ask for help, and he promises to give us all that, and he usually gives us more, and indeed it is observable, that no story tells of any godly man, who li|ving in the fear of God fell into a violent and unpardoned impatience in his naturall sick|nesse, if he used those means which God and his holy Church have appointed. We see al|most all men bear their last sicknesse <HI>with sor|rowes</HI> indeed, but <HI>without violent passions</HI>; and unlesse they fear death violently, they suffer the sicknesse with some indifferency; and it is
<PB N="99" REF="78">
a rare thing to see a man who enjoyes his rea|son in his sicknesse, to expresse the proper signes of a direct and solemne impatience. For when God layes a sicknesse upon us, he seizes commonly on a mans spirits, which are the instruments of action and businesse; and when they are secured from being tumultuous, the sufferance is much the easier; and therefore sicknesse secures all that, which can do the man mischief. It makes him tame and passive, apt for suffering, and confines him to an un|active condition. To which if we adde, that God then commonly produces fear, and all those passions which naturally tend to humili|ty and poverty of spirit, we shall soon perceive by what instruments God verifies his promise to us, (which is the great security for our pa|tience, and the easinesse of our condition) that <HI>God will lay no more upon us then he will make us able to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ear,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 10.13.</NOTE> <HI>but together with the affli|ction he will finde a way to escape:</HI> Nay, if any thing can be more then this; we have two or three promises,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 9.9 Mat. 7.7 Iam. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.13 P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al. 31.19, 24. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sal. 34.21, 22.</NOTE> in which we may safely lodge our selves, and roul from off our thorns and finde ease and rest: God hath <HI>promised to be with us in our trouble,</HI> and <HI>to be with us in our prayers,</HI> and <HI>to be with us in our hope</HI> and <HI>con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">idence.</HI></P>

Remember that thou art a man and a Christian: as <HI>the Covenant of nature</HI> hath made it <HI>necessary,</HI> so <HI>the covenant of grace</HI> hath made it to be <HI>chosen</HI> by thee, to be a suffering person: either you must renounce your religion, or submit to the impositions of God, and thy portion of sufferings. So that here we see our advantages, and let us use them accordingly. The barbarous and warlike nations of old, could fight well and willingly, but could not bear sicknesse manfully. The Greeks were cowardly in their fights, as most wise men are, but because they were learned and well taught, they bore their sicknesse with pati|ence and severity. The <HI>Cimbrians</HI> and <HI>Celti|berians</HI> rejoyce in battail like Gyants, but in their diseases they weep like Women. These according to their institution and designes had unequal courages, and accidental forti|tude; but since our Religion hath made <HI>a covenant of sufferings</HI>; and the great businesse of our lives is <HI>sufferings,</HI> and most of the ver|tues of a Christian are <HI>passive graces,</HI> and all the promises of the Gospel are passed upon us through <HI>Christs crosse,</HI> we have a necessity up|on us to have an equal courage in all the va|riety of our sufferings: for without an uni|versal fortitude we can do nothing of our dutie.</P>
<P N="4">4. Resolve to do as much as you can: for certain it is, we can suffer very much, if we list; and many men have afflicted themselves unreasonably by not being skilful to consider how much their strength and state could per|mit; and our flesh is nice and imperious, crafty to perswade reason that she hath more necessities th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n indeed belong to her, and that
<PB N="101" REF="79">
she demands nothing superfluous: suffer as much in obedience to God as you can suffer for necessity, or passion, fear, or desire. And if you can for one thing, you can for another, and there is nothing wanting but the minde. Never say; <HI>I can do no more, I cannot endure this.</HI> For God would not have sent it, if he had not known thee strong enough to abide it; onely he that knows thee well already, would also take this occasion to make thee know thy self. But it will be fit that you pray to God to give you a discerning spirit, that you may rightly distinguish <HI>just necessity</HI> from <HI>the flattery</HI> and fondnesses of flesh and blood.</P>
<P N="5">5. Propound to your eyes and heart the example of the holy Jesus upon the crosse; he endured more for thee then thou canst either for thy self or him: and remember that if we be put to suffer, and do suffer <HI>in a good cause,</HI> or <HI>in a good manner,</HI> so that in any sense your sufferings be conformable to his sufferings, or can be capable of being united to his, we shall reign together with him. <HI>The high way of the Crosse</HI> which the King of suffer|ings hath troden before us, is the way <HI>to ease, to a kingdom,</HI> and <HI>to felicity.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. The very suffering is a title to an excel|lent inheritance: for, <HI>God chastens every son whom he receives,</HI> and if we be not chastised, <HI>we are bastards and not sons</HI>: and be confident, that although God <HI>often</HI> sends pardon without correction, yet he <HI>never</HI> sends correction with|out pardon, unless it be thy fault: and there|fore take every or any affliction as an earnest peny of thy pardon; and upon condition there may be peace with God, let any thing be wel|come that he can send as its instrument or
<PB N="102" REF="80">
condition. Suffer therefore God to choose his own circumstances of adopting thee, and be content to be under discipline when the re|ward of that is, <HI>to become the son of God</HI>: and by such inflictions he hewes and breaks thy body, first dressing it to funeral, and then pre|paring it for immortality: and if this be the effect or the designe of Gods love to thee; let it be occasion of thy love to him: and re|member that the truth of love is hardly known, but by somewhat that puts us to pain.</P>
<P N="7">7. Use this as a punishment for thy sins; and so God intends it most commonly; that is certain, if therefore thou submittest to it, thou approvest of the divine judgement: and no man can have cause to complain of any thing, but of himself; if either he believes God to be just, or himself to be a sinner: if he either thinks he hath deserved Hell, or that this little may be a means to prevent the greater, and bring him to Heaven.</P>
<P N="8">8. It may be that this may be the last in|stance, and the last opportunity that ever God will give thee to exercise any vertue, to do him any service, or thy self any advantage; be careful that thou losest not this; for to eternal ages, this never shall return again.</P>
<P N="9">9. Or if thou peradventure shalt be re|stored to health, be carefull that in the day of thy thanksgiving, thou mayest not be ashamed of thy self, for having behaved thy self poorly and weakly upon thy bed: it will be a sensible and excellent comfort to thee, and double upon thy spirit, if when thou shalt worship God for restoring thee, thou shalt also remem|ber that thou didst do him service in thy suf|fering, and tell that God was hugely gracious
<PB N="103" REF="80">
to thee in giving thee the opportunity of a vertue, at so easie a rate as a sicknesse, from which thou didst recover.</P>
<P N="10">10. Few men are so sick, but they believe that they may recover; and we shal seldom see a man lie down with a perfect persuasion that it is his last hour; for many men have been sicker, and yet have recovered; but whether thou doest or no, thou hast a vertue to exer|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ise, which may be a handmaid to thy pati|ence. <HI>Epaphroditus</HI> was sick, sick unto death, and yet God had mercy upon him; and he hath done so to thousands, to whom he found it useful in the great order of things, and the events of universal providence. If therefore thou desirest to recover, here is cause enough of hope; and hope is designed in the arts of God and of the Spirit, to support patience. But if thou recoverest not, yet there is some|thing that is matter of joy naturally, and very much Spiritually if thou belongest to God, and <HI>joy</HI> is as certain a support to patience, as <HI>hope</HI>; and it is no small cause of being pleased, when we remember that if we recover not, our sicknesse shall the sooner sit down in rest and joy. For recovery by death, as it is easier and better then the recovery by a sickly health, so it is not so long in doing: it suffers not the tediousnesse of a creeping restitution, nor the inconvenience of Surgeons and Phy|sitians, watchfulnesse and care, keepings in, and suffering trouble, fears of relapse and the little reliques of a storm.</P>
<P N="11">11. While we hear, or use, or think of these remedies, part of the sicknesse is gone away, and all of it is passing. And if by such instru|ments we stand armed and ready dressed be|fore

<P N="12">12 But our patience will be the better se|cured, if we consider that it is not violently tempted by the usual arrests of sicknesse; for patience is with reason demanded while the sicknesse is tolerable; that is, so long as the evil is not too great; but if it be also eligible, and have in it some degrees of good, our pa|tience will have in it the lesse difficulty, and the greater necessity. This therefore will be a new stock of consideration. <HI>Sicknesse is in many degrees eligible to many men, and to many pur|poses.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SECT. VI. Advantages of Sicknesse.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. I Consider: one of the great felicities of heaven consists in an immunity from sin: then we shall love God without mixtures of malice; then we shall enjoy without envy; then we shall see fuller vessels running over with glory, and crowned with bigger circles, and this we shall behold without spilling from our eyes (those vessels of joy and grief) any signe of anger, trouble or a repining spirit:
<PB N="105" REF="81">
our passions shall be pure, our charity without fear, our desire without lust, our possessions all our own, and all in the inheritance of Je|sus, in the richest soil of Gods eternall king|dom. Now half of this reason which makes heaven so happy by being innocent, is also in the state of sicknesse, making the furrows of old age smooth, and the groans of a sick heart apt to be joyned to the musick of An|gels; and though they sound harsh to our untuned ears and discomposed Organs, yet those accents must needs be in themselves ex|cellent which God loves to hear, and esteems them as <HI>prayers</HI> and <HI>arguments of pity,</HI> instru|ments of mercie and grace, and preparatives to glory.</P>
<P>In sicknesse, the soul begins to dresse her self for immortality: and first she unties the strings of vanity that made her upper garment cleave to the world and sit uneasily. First she puts off the light and phantastic summer robe of lust, and wanton appetite, and as soon as that <HI>Cestus</HI> that lascivious girdle is thrown a|way, then the <HI>reins chasten us and give us warn|ing in the night</HI>: then that which called us for|merly to serve <HI>the manlinesse of the body,</HI> and <HI>the childishnesse of the soul,</HI> keeps us waking, to di|vide the hours with the intervals of prayer, and to number the minutes with our penitential groans: Then the flesh sits uneasily and dwells in sorrow, and then the spirit feels it self at ease, freed from the petulant sollicitations of those passions which in health were as buisie and as restlesse as atomes in the sun, alwayes dancing and alwayes busie and never sitting down till a sad night of grief and uneasinesse draws the vail, and lets them dye alone in se|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ret dishonour.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="106" REF="82">2. Next to this; <HI>the soul by the help of sick|nesse knocks off the fetters of pride and vainer complacencies.</HI> Then she drawes the curtains, and stops the lights from coming in,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><L>Nunc festinatos nimium tibi sent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t honores</L>

Then the Spirit stoops into the sobrie|ties of humble thoughts and feels corruption chiding the forwardnesse of fancy, and allaying the vapours of conceit and factious opinions. For humility is the souls grave into which he enters, not to die, but to meditate and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> terre some of its troublesome appendages. There she sees the dust, and feels the dishonours of the body, and reads the Register of all its sad adherencies; and then she layes by all her vain reflexions, beating upon her Chrystall and pure mirrour from the fancies of strength and beauty, &amp; little decayed prettinesses of the body. And when in sicknesse we forget all our knotty discourses of Philosophy, and a Syllo|gisme makes our head ake, and we feel our many and loud talkings served no lasting end of the soul, no purpose that now we must a|bide by; and that the body is like to descend to the land, where all things are forgotten, then she layes aside all her remembrances of applauses, all her ignorant confidences, and cares onely to <HI>know Christ Iesus and him cruci|fied,</HI> to know him plainly, and with much heartinesse, and simplicity. And I cannot think this to be a contemptible advantage&punc; for ever since man tempted himself by his im|patient desires of knowing, and being as God,
<PB N="107" REF="82">
Man thinks it the finest thing in the world to know much, and therefore is hugely apt to esteem himself better then his brethren, if he knowes some little impertinencies, and them imperfectly, and that with infinite uncertainty; But God hath been pleased with a rare art to prevent the inconveniencies apt to arise by this passionate longing after knowledge; even by giving to every man a sufficient opinion of his own understanding; and who is there in the world that thinks himself to be a fool, or indeed not fit to govern his brother? There are but few men but they think they are wise enough, and every man believes his own opi|nion the soundest, and if it were otherwise, men would burst themselves with envy, or else become irrecoverable slaves to the talking and disputing man. But when God intended this permission to be an antidote of envy, and a satisfaction and allay to the troublesome appe|tites of knowing, and made that this univer|sal opinion by making men in some propor|tions equal should be a keeper out, or a great restraint to slavery, and tyranny respectively, Man (for so he uses to do) hath turned this into bitternesse: for when nature had made so just a distribution of understanding, that every man might think he had enough, he is not content with that, but will think he hath more then his brother: and whereas it might well be imployed in restraining slavery, he hath used it to break off the bands of all obe|dience, and it ends in pride and schismes, in heresies and tyrannies: and it being a spiri|tual evil, it growes upon the soul with old age and flattery, with health and the supports of a prosperous fortune. Now besides the direct
<PB N="108" REF="83">
operations of the Spirit, and a powerfull grace, there is in nature left to us no remedy for this evil, but a sharp sicknesse, or an equall sorrow, and allay of fortune; and then we are humble enough to ask counsell of a de|spised Priest, and to think that even a com|mon sentence from the mouth of an appointed comforter streams forth more refreshment then all our own wiser and more reputed discourses.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><L>Ubi jam validi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> quassatum est viribus aevi</L>

quite cured; but God that hath found out re|medies for all diseases, hath so ordered the cir|cumstances of man, that in worser sort of men, anger and great indignation consume and shrivell into little peevishnesses and uneasie accents of sicknesse, and spend themselves in trifling instances: and in the better and more sanctified, it goes off in prayers, and alms, and solemn reconcilement: And however, the temptations of this state, such I mean which are proper to it, are little and inconsiderable: The man is apt to chide a servant too bitterly, and to be discontented with his nurse, or not satisfied with his Phy|sitian, and he rests uneasily and (poor man) nothing can please him; and indeed these little undecencies must be cured and stop|ped, lest they run into an inconvenience. But sicknesse is in this particular a little image of the state of blessed Souls, or of <HI>Adams</HI> early morning in Paradise, free from the troubles of lust, and violencies of anger, and the in|tricacies of ambition, or the restlesnesse of covetousnesse. For though a man may carry all these along with him into his sicknesse, yet there he will not finde them, and in despite of all his own malice, his soul shall finde some rest from labouring in the galleys, and baser captivity of sin: and if we value those moments of being in the love of God, and in the kingdom of grace, which certainly are the beginnings of felicity, we may also remember that the not sinning actually, is one step of innocence; and therefore that state is not in|tolerable, which by a sensible trouble, makes it in most instances impossible to commit those great sins, which make death, and hell, and
<PB N="110" REF="84">
horrid damnations. And then let us but adde this to it; that God sends sicknesses, but he never causes sin; that God is angry with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inning person, but never with a man for be|ing sick; that sin causes God to hate us, and sicknesse causes him to pity us; that all wise men in the world choose trouble rather then dishonour; affliction rather then basenesse; and that sicknesse stops the torrent of sin, and interrupts its violence; and even to the worst men, makes it to retreat many degrees; we may reckon sicknesse amongst good things, as we reckon Rhubarb, and Alo&euml;s, and child-birth, and labour, and obedience, and disci|pline: These are unpleasant, and yet safe; they are troubles in order to blessings, or they are securities from danger, or the hard choices of a lesse and a more tolerable evil.</P>

But when we are bidden to beleeve strange pro|positions, we are put upon it when we cannot judge, and those propositions have possessed

our discerning faculties, and have made a par|ty there, and are become domestick before they come to be disputed, and then the articles of faith are so few, and are made so credible, and in their event and in their object are so usefull and gaining upon the affections, that he were a prodigie of man, and would be so esteemed, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t should in all our present cir|cumstances disbeleeve any point of faith: and all is well as long as the Sun shines, and the fair breath of heaven gently wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts us to our own purposes.

Can you then trust his goodnesse, &amp; beleeve him to be a Father when you groan under his rod?

For in our health and clearer dayes, it is easy to talk of putting trust in God: we readily trust him for life when we are in health;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mors ipsa beatior inde est Quod per cruciamina lethi via panditur ardua justis &amp; ad astra doloribus itur. <HI>Prud. hymn. in exeq. de|funct.</HI></NOTE> for provisions when we have fair revenues; and for de|liverance when we are newly escaped, but let us come to fit upon the mar|gent of our grave, and let a Tyrant lean hard upon our fortunes, and dwell upon our wrong, let the storm arise, and the keels tosse till the cordage crack, or that all our hopes bulge under us, and descend into the hollownesse of sad misfortunes; then can you believe, when you neither hear, nor see, nor feel any thing but objections?

<P N="5">5. Sicknesse hath some degrees of eligi|bility, at least by an after-choice; because to all persons which are within the possibilities and state of pardon, it becomes a great in|strument of pardon of sins. For as God sel|dom rewards here and hereafter too: So it is not very often that he punishes in both states; In great and finall sins he doth so; but we finde it expressed onely in the case of the sin against the Holy Ghost, <HI>which shall never be forgiven in this world, nor in the world to come</HI>; that is, it shall be punished in both worlds, and the infelicities of this world shall but usher in the intollerable calamities of the next. But this is in a case of extremity, and in sins of an unpardonable malice: In those lesser stages of death which are deviations from the rule, and not a destruction and per|fect antinomy to the whole institution; God very often smites with his rod of sicknesse, that
<PB N="117" REF="87">
he may not for ever be slaying the soul with eternall death.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ps. 89.33</NOTE> <HI>I will visit their offences with the rod, and their sin with scourges: Neverthelesse my loving kindenesse will I not utterly take from him: nor suffer my truth to fail.</HI> And there is in the New Testament <HI>a delivering over to Satan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 5.5</NOTE> and a consequent <HI>buffeting</HI> for the mortification of the flesh indeed; but <HI>that the soul may be saved in the day of the Lord.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">im. 1.20.</NOTE> And to some persons the utmost processe of Gods anger reaches but to a sharp sicknesse, or at most, but to a temporall death, and then the <HI>little momentany anger</HI> is spent, and expires in rest, and a quiet grave. <HI>Origen,</HI> S. <HI>Austin,</HI> and <HI>Cassian</HI> say concerning <HI>Ananias</HI> and <HI>Sapphira,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Digni erant in hoc saeculo reci|pere peccatum suum, ut mun|diores exeant ab hac vita, mun|dati castigatione sibi illata per mortem com nunem, quo|niam credentes erant in Chri|stum. <HI>Origen</HI> S. <HI>Aug. l.</HI> 3. <HI>c.</HI> 1. <HI>contr.

And God cuts off many of his children from the land of the living; and yet when they are numbred amongst our dead, he findes them in the book of life, written amongst those that shall live to him for ever: and thus it happened to many new Christians in the Church of Co|rinth for their little undecencies, and disor|ders in the circumstances of receiving the holy Sacrament. S. <HI>Paul</HI> sayes;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 11.30.</NOTE> [that <HI>many amongst them were sick, may were weak, and some were fallen asleep</HI>] He expresses the divine anger against those persons in no louder accents; which according to the stile of
<PB N="118" REF="88">
the New Testament, where all the great transactions of duty and reproof are generally made upon the stock of <HI>Heaven,</HI> and <HI>Hell</HI> is plainly a <HI>reserve,</HI> and a <HI>period</HI> set to the decla|ration of Gods wrath. For God knowes that the torments of hell are so horrid, so insup|portable a calamity, that he is not easy and apt to cast those souls, which he hath taken so much care, and hath been at so much expence to save, into the eternal never dying flames of Hell, lightly, for smaller sins, or after a fairly begun repentance, and in the midst of holy desires to finish it: But God takes such pe|nalties, and exacts such fines of us, which we may pay, <HI>salvo contenemento</HI> saving the main stake of all, even our <HI>precious souls.</HI> And there|fore <HI>S. Augustine</HI> prayed to God in his peni|tential sorrowes. <HI>Here O Lord burn and cut my flesh that thou mayest spare me for ever.</HI> For so said our blessed Saviour, <HI>Every sacrifice must be seasoned with salt, and every sacrifice must be burnt with fire,</HI> that is, we must abide in the state of grace, and if we have committed sins we must expect to be put into the state of affliction, and yet the sacrifice will send up a right and un|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">roubled cloud, and a sweet smell to joyn with the incense of the Altar, where the eternal Priest offers a never ceasing sacrifice. And now I have said a thing against which there can be no exceptions, and of which no just reason can make abatement. For when sicknesse which is the condition of our nature is called for, with purposes of redemption; when we are sent to death to secure eternal life, when God strikes us that he may spare us, it shewes that we have done things which he essentially hates, and therefore we must be smitten with
<PB N="119" REF="88">
the rod of God: but <HI>in the midst of judgement God remembers mercy</HI> and makes the rod to be medicinal, and like the rod of God in the hand of <HI>Aaron</HI> to shoot forth buds, and leaves, and Almonds, hopes, and mercies and eter|nal recompences in the day of restitution. This is so great a good to us, if it be well con|ducted in all the chanels of its intention and designe, that if we had put off the objections of the flesh with abstractions, contempts and separations, so as we ought to do, were as earnestly to be prayed for, as any gay blessing that crowns our cups with joy and our heads with garlands and forgetfulnesse. But this was it which I said, that this may, nay that it ought to be chosen, at least by an <HI>after-election</HI>: for so said S. <HI>Paul, If we judge our selves we shall not be condemned of the Lord,</HI> that is, if we judge our selves worthy of the sicknesse; if we acknowledge and confesse Gods justice in smiting us, if we take the rod of God in our own hands, and are willing to imprint it in the flesh, <HI>we are workers together with God,</HI> in the inflicti|on, and then the sickness beginning, and being managed in the vertue of repentance, and pa|tience and resignation and charity, will end in peace and pardon and justification, and con|signation to glory. That I have spoken truth I have brought Gods Spirit speaking in Scri|pture for a witnesse. But if this be true, there are not many states of life that have ad|vantages which can out-weigh this great in|strument of security to our final condition.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 4.5.</NOTE> <HI>Moses dyed at the mouth of the Lord</HI>; said the story; <HI>he died with the kisses of the Lords mouth,</HI> (so the Chaldee Paraphrase) it was the greatest act of kindesse that God did to his servant <HI>Moses; he kissed him and he died</HI>; But I have
<PB N="120" REF="89">
some things to observe for the better finishing this consideration.</P>
<P N="1">1. All these advantages and lessenings of evil in the state of sicknesse are onely upon the stock of vertue, and religion. There is no|thing can make sicknesse in any sense eligible, or in many senses tolerable but onely the grace of God;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><Q><P>Haec clemencia non paratur arte Sed norunt cui serviunt leones.</P>
<P>Silatus aut renes morbo tentan|tur acuto.</P>

<BIBL><HI>Hor. l.</HI> 1. <HI>ep.</HI> 6.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> that onely turns sicknesse into easinesse and felicity, which also turnes it into vertue. For whosoever goes about to comfort a vi|tious person when he lies sick upon his bed, can onely discourse of the necessi|ties of nature, of the unavoidableness of the suffering, of the accidental vexations and increase of torments by impatience, of the fellowship of all the sons of <HI>Adam,</HI> and such other little considerations, which indeed if sadly reflected upon and found to stand a|lone, teach him nothing, but the de|gree of his calamity, and the evil of his condition; and teach him such a patience and minister to him such a comfort which can only make him to observ decent gestures in his sicknesse, and to converse with his friends and standers by so as may do them comfort, and ease their funeral and civil complaints; but do him no true advantage. For all that may be spoken to a beast when he is crowned with hairlaces and bound with fillets to the Altar, to bleed to death to appease the anger of the Deity, and to ease the burden of his Relatives. And indeed what comfort can he receive, whose sicknesse as it looks back is an effect of Gods indignation, and fierce vengeance, and if it goes forward and enters into the gates of
<PB N="121" REF="89">
the grave is a beginning of a sorrow that shall shall never have an ending. But when the sick|nesse is a messenger sent from a chastising Fa|ther; when it first turns into degrees of inno|cence, and then into vertues, and thence into pardon, this is no misery, but such a method of the Divine oeconomy, and dispensation, as resolves to bring us to heaven without any new impositions, but meerly upon the stock and charges of nature.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let it be observed that these advan|tages which spring from sicknesse, are not in all instances of vertue, nor to all persons. Sicknesse is the proper scene for patience, and resignation, for all the passive graces of a Christian, for faith and hope, and for some single acts of the love of God. But <HI>sicknesse is not a fit station for a penitent</HI>; and it can serve the ends of the grace of <HI>repentance</HI> but <HI>accidentally:</HI> Sicknesse may<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Nec t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> men pu|taverant ad rem pertinere ubi in cia perent quod pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|cuerat ut sieret.</NOTE> begin a repent|ance, if God continues life, and if we coope|rate with the Divine grace: or sicknesse may help to alleviate the wrath of God and to fa|cilitate the pardon, if all the other parts of this duty be performed in our healthfull state; so that it may serve at the entrance in, or at the going out. But sicknesse at no hand is a good stage to represent all the substantiall parts of this duty: 1. It invites to it, 2. It makes it appear necessary, 3. It takes off the fancies of vanity, 4. It attempers the spirit, 5. It cures hypocrisie, 6. It tames the fumes of pride, 7. It is the school of patience, 8. And by taking us from off the brisker re|lishes of the world, it makes us with more gust to taste the things of the Spirit: and all this, onely when God fits the circumstances of
<PB N="122" REF="90">
the sicknesse, so as to consist with acts of rea|son, consideration, choice, and a present and reflecting minde: which then God sends when he means that the sickness of the body should be the cure of the soul. But let no man so re|ly upon it, as by designe, to trust the begin|ning, the progresse, and the consummation of our piety to such an estate which for ever leaves it unperfect: and though to some per|sons it addes degrees, and ministers opportu|nities, and exercises single acts with great advantage, <HI>in passive graces,</HI> yet it is never an intire or sufficient instrument for the change of our condition, from the state of death <HI>to the liberty</HI> and life <HI>of the sons of God.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. It were good if we would transact the affairs of our souls with noblenesse and inge|nuity, and that we would by an early and for|ward religion prevent the necessary arts of the Divine providence. It is true, that God cures some by incision, by fire and torments, but these are ever the more obstinate and more unrelenting natures.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ne&abque; tam aversa unquam videbitur ab ope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e suo pro|videntia ut debil|tas inter optima inventa <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">it.</NOTE> Gods providence is not so afflictive and full of trouble as that it hath placed sicknesse and infirmity amongst things simply necessary; and in most persons it is but a sickly and an effeminate vertue which is imprinted upon our spirits with fears and the sorrowes of a feaver, or a peev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sh consumption. It is but a miserable remedy to be beholding to a sicknesse for our health, and though it be better to suffer the losse of a finger, then that the arm and the whole bo|dy should putrifie, yet even then also it is a trouble, and an evil to lose a finger. He that mends with sicknesse pares the nails of the beast, when they have already torn off part
<PB N="123" REF="90">
of the flesh: But he that would have a sicknesse become a clear and an entire blessing, a thing indeed to be reckoned among the good things of God, and the evil things of the world, must lead an holy life, and judge him|self with an early sentence, and so order the affairs of his soul, that in the usuall method of Gods saving us, there may be nothing left to be done, but that such vertues should be exercised which God intends to crown: and then, as when the Athenians upon a day of battell with longing and uncertain souls sate in their Common-hall expecting what would be the sentence of the day, at last received a messenger, who onely had breath enough left him to say, [<HI>We are conquerours</HI>] and so died: So shall the sick person, who hath <HI>fought a good fight, and kept the faith,</HI> and onely wait<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for his dissolution, and his sentence, breaths forth his spirit, with the accents of a conque|rour, and his sicknesse and his death shall one|ly make the mercy and the vertue more il|lustrious.</P>
<P>But for the sicknesse it self; if all the ca|lumnies were true concerning it, with which it is aspersed, yet it is far to be preferred be|fore the most pleasant sin, and before a great secular businesse, and a temporall care; and some men wake as much in the foldings of the softest beds, as others on the crosse: and sometimes the very weight of sorrow, and the wearinesse of a sicknesse presses the spirit in|to slumbers and the images of rest, when the intemperate or the lustfull person rolls upon his uneasie thorns, and sleep is departed from his eyes. Certainly it is, <HI>some sicknesse is a blessing.</HI> Indeed, blindnesse were a most ac|cursed
<PB N="124" REF="91">
thing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Detesta. bilis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rit caecitas si nemo o|culos per diderit ni|si cui eru|ondisunt.</NOTE> if no man were ever blind, but he whose eyes are pulled out with tortures, or burning basins; and if sickness were always a testimony of Gods anger, and a violence to a mans whole condition, then it were a huge calamity: but because God sends it to his servants, to his children, to little infants, to Apostles and Saints, with designes of mercy, to preserve their innocence, to overcome tem|ptation, to try their vertue, to fit them for re|wards; it is certain, that sicknesse never is an evil, but by our own faults; and if we will do our duty, we shall be sure to turn it into a blessing. If the sicknesse be great it may end in death;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Memineris ergo maximos do|lores morte finiri, parvos ha|bere multa intervalla requie|tis, mediocrium nos esse domi|nos. <HI>Cicero.</HI></NOTE> and the greater it is, the sooner; and if it be very little, it hath great inter|valls of rest; if it be be|tween both we may be Masters of it, and by serving the ends of Pro|vidence serve also the perfective end of hu|mane nature, and enter into the possession of everlasting mercies.</P>
<P>The summe is this; He that is afraid of pain, is afraid of his own nature, and if his fear be violent, it is a signe his patience is none at all; and an impatient person is not ready dressed for heaven. None but suffering, humble, and patient persons can go to hea|ven: and when God hath given us the whole stage of our life to exercise all the active ver|tues of religion, it is necessary in the state of vertues that some portion and period of our lives be assigned to passive graces; for patience, for Christian fortitude, for resigna|tion, or conformity to the Divine will. But
<PB N="125" REF="91">
as the violent fear of sicknesse makes us impa|tient, so it will make our death without com|fort and without religion, and we shall go off from our stage of actions and sufferings, with an unhandsome exit, because we were willing to receive the Kindnesse of God when he expressed it as we listed: But we would not suffer him to be kinde and gracious to us in his own method, nor were willing to ex|ercise and improve our vertues at the charge of a sharp Feaver or a lingring consumption.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecclus. 2.14.</NOTE> <HI>Woe be to the man that hath lost patience, for what will he do when the Lord shall visit him.</HI></P>

<P>THere is nothing which can make sicknesse unsanctified, but the same also will give us cause to fear death. If therefore we so order our affairs and spirits, that we do no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fear death, our sickness may easily become our advantage, and we can then receive counsel, and consider, and do those acts of vertue, which are in that state the proper services of God: and such which men in bondage and fear are not capable of doing, or of advices how they should, when they come to the ap|pointed dayes of mourning.

But we are so softned and made effeminate with deli|cate thoughts and meditations of ease, and brutish satisfactions, that if our death comes before we have seized upon a great-fortune, or enjoy the promises of the fortune tellers, we esteem our selves to be robbed of our goods, to be mocked, and miserable.

But so have I known passionate women to shrike aloud when their neerest relatives were dying, and that horrid shrike hath stayed the spirit of the man, a while to wonder at the folly, and repre|sent the inconvenience, and the dying person hath lived one day longer, full of pain, amazed with an undeterminate spirit, distorted with convulsions, and onely come again to act one scene more of a new calamity, and to die with less decency: so also do very many men, with passion and a troubled interest, they strive to continue their life longer, and it may be they escape this sickness, and live to fall into a dis|grace; they escape the storm and fall into the hands of pyrats, and instead of dying with li|berty, they live like slaves, miserable and despi|sed, servants to a litle time, and sottish admirers of the breath of their own lungs. <HI>Paulus Aemili|us</HI> did handsomly reprove the cowardice of the King of <HI>Macedon,</HI> who begged of him for pities sake and humanity, that having conquered him and taken his kingdom from him he would be content with that, and not lead him in tri|umph a prisoner to Rome. <HI>Aemilius</HI> told him he need not be beholding to him for that: himself might prevent that in despite of him. But the timorous King durst not die: But certainly every wise man will easily believe that it had been better the Macedonian Kings should have dyed in battel, then protract their life so long, till some of them came to be Scriveners and Joyners at Rome: or that the

Tyrant of Sicily better had perished in the Adriatic, then to be wafted to Corinth safely and there turn Schoolmaster.

<BIBL><HI>Plaut.

<P N="6">6. It is so harmelesse a thing, that no good man was ever thought the more miserable for dying, but much the happier. When men saw the graves of <HI>Calatinus,</HI> of the <HI>Servicij,</HI> the <HI>Scipio's,</HI> the <HI>Metelli,</HI> did ever any man among the wisest Romans think them unhappy? And when S. <HI>Paul</HI> fell under the sword of <HI>Nero,</HI> and S. <HI>Peter</HI> died upon the crosse, and S. <HI>Stephen</HI> from an heap of stones was carried into an easier grave, they that made great la|mentation over them, wept for their own in|terest, and after the manner of men; but the Martyrs were accounted happy, and their dayes kept solemnly, and their memories preserved
<PB N="133" REF="95">
in never dying honours. When S. <HI>Hilary</HI> Bi|shop of Poictiers in France went into the East to reproove the Arian heresie, he heard that a young noble Gentleman, treated with his daughter <HI>Abra</HI> for marriage: The Bishop wrote to his daughter, that she should not in|gage her promise, nor do countenance to that request, because he had provided for her a hus|band fair, rich, wise and noble, farre beyond her present offer. The event of which was this: She obeyed, and when her father retur|ned from his Eastern triumph to his Western charge, he prayed to God that his daughter might die quickly, and God heard his pray|ers, and Christ took her into his bosome, enter|taining her with antepasts and caresses of holy love, till the day of the marriage Supper of the Lamb shall come. But when the Bishops wife observed this event, and understood of the good man her husband what was done, and why, she never left him alone till he ob|tained the same favour for her; and she also at the prayers of S. <HI>Hilary</HI> went into a more early grave and a bed of joyes.</P>
<P N="7">7. It is a sottish and an unlearned thing to reckon the time of our life as it is short or long, to be good or evil fortune; life in it self being neither good nor bad, but just as we make it, and therefore so is death.</P>
<P N="8">8. But when we consider, death is not onely better then a miserable life, not onely an easie and innocent thing in it self, but also that it is a state of advantage, we shall have reason not to double the sharpnesses of our sicknesse by our fear of death: Certain it is, death hath some good upon its proper stock:

<HEAD>SECT. VIII. Remedies against fear of death, by way of exercise.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>HE that would willingly be fearlesse of death, must learn to despise the world</HI>; he must neither love any thing passionately, nor be proud of any circumstance of his life.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><L><GAP DESC="foreign"></L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign"></L>

<BIBL>Pindar.</BIBL></NOTE> <HI>O death how bitter is the remembrance of thee to a man that liveth at rest in his possessions, to a man that hath nothing to vex him, and that hath prosperity in all things, yea unto him that is yet able to receive meat?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecclus. 41.1.</NOTE> said the son of <HI>Si|rach.</HI>
<PB N="135" REF="96">
But the parts of this exercise help each other. If a man be not incorporated in all his passions to the things of this world, he will lesse fear to be divorced from them by a super|vening death; and yet because he must part with them all in death, it is but reasonable he should not be passionate for so fugitive and transient interest. But if any man thinks well of himself for being a handsome person, or if he be stronger and wiser then his neigh|bours, he must remember that what he boasts of will decline into weaknesse and disho|nour; but that very boasting and compla|cency, will make death keener, and more un|welcome, because it comes to take him from his confidences and pleasures, making his beauty equal to those Ladies that have slept some years in Charnel houses, and their strength not so stubborn as the breath of an infant, and their wisdom such which can be looked for in the land where all things are forgotten.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>He that would not fear death, must streng|then his spirit with the proper instruments of Christian fortitude.</HI> All men are resolved upon this, that to bear grief honestly and tempe|rately and to dye willingly and nobly is the duty of a good and of a valiant man: and they that are not so, are <HI>vitious,</HI> and <HI>fools,</HI> and <HI>cowards.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><L>Amittenda fortitudo est aut sepeliendus dolor. Cic.</L>

them to the danger of the Tyrant: and <HI>Calanus</HI> the barbarous and unlearned <HI>Indian</HI> willingly suffered himself to be burnt alive: and all the women did so, to do honour to their Husbands Funeral, and to represent and prove their affections great to their Lords. The religion of a Christian does more com|mand fortitude, then ever did any institution; for we are commanded to be willing to die for Christ, to dye for the brethren, to dye ra|ther then give offence or scandal; the effect of which is this; that he that is instructed to do the necessary parts of his duty; is by the same instrument fortified against death: As he that does his duty need not fear death: so neither shall he; the parts of his duty, are parts of his security. It is certainly a great basenesse and pusillanimitie of spirit that makes death terrible and extremely to be a|voided.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Christian prudence</HI> is a great security a|gainst the fear of death. For if we be afraid of death it is but reasonable to use all spiritual arts to take off the apprehension of the evil: but therefore we ought to remove our fear, because fear gives to death wings and spurres, and darts. Death hastens to a fearful man: if therefore you would make death harmlesse and slow; to throw off fear is the way to do it; and prayer is the way to do that. If there|fore you be afraid of death, consider you will have lesse need to fear it, by how much the less you do fear it: and so cure your direct fear by a reflex act of prudence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hostem cum fu|geret se Fan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nius ipse pere|mit. Mar.</NOTE> and consideration. <HI>Fannius</HI> had not dyed so soon, if he had not feared death: and when <HI>Cneius Carbo</HI> begged the respite of a little time for a base imploy|ment
<PB N="137" REF="97">
of the souldiers of <HI>Pompey,</HI> he got no|thing, but that the basenesse of his fear disho|noured the dignity of his third Consulship; and he chose to dye in a place, where none but his meanest servants should have seen him. I remember a story of the wrastler <HI>Polydamas</HI> that running into a cave to avoid the storm, the water at last swelled so high, that it began to presse that hollownesse to a ruine: which when his fellowes espied they chose to enter into the common fate of all men, and went abroad: but <HI>Polydamas</HI> thought by his strength to support the earth till its intolerable weight crushed him into flatnesse and a grave. Many men run for shelter to a place, and they onely finde a remedie for their fears by feeling the worst of evils: fear it self findes no sanctuary but the worst of sufferance; and they that flye from a battel are exposed to the mercy and fury of the pursuers, who if they faced about, were as well disposed to give laws of life and death, as to take them; and at worst can but die nobly; but now even at the very best, they live shamefully or die timorously. Cou|rage is the greatest security; for it does most commonly safeguard the man, but alwayes rescues the condition from an intolerable e|vil.</P>
<P N="4">4. If thou wilt be fearlesse of death, en|deavour to be in love with the felicities of Saints and Angels: and be once perswaded to believe that there is a condition of living better then this; that there are creatures more noble then we; that above there is a countrey better then ours; that the inhabitants know more and know better; and are in places of rest and desire: and first learn to value it, and
<PB N="138" REF="98">
then learn to purchase it; and death cannot be a formidable thing, which lets us into so much joy &amp; so much felicity. And indeed who would not think his condition mended if he passed from conversing with dull mortals, with ignorant and foolish persons, with Tyrants and enemies of learning, to converse with <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Plato,</HI> with <HI>Socrates</HI> and <HI>Cicero,</HI> with <HI>Plutarch</HI> and <HI>Fabricius</HI>? So the Heathens spe|culated: but we consider higher. The <HI>dead that die in the Lord</HI> shall converse with S. <HI>Paul,</HI> and all the Colledge of the Apostles, and all the Saints and Martyrs; with all the good men whose memory we preserve in honour: with excellent Kings and holy Bishops, and with <HI>the great Shepherd and Bishop of our souls Iesus Christ,</HI> and with God himself. For <HI>Christ dyed for us, that whether we wake or sleep we might live together with him.</HI> Then we shall be free from lust and envy, from fear and rage, from covetousnesse and sorrow, from tears and cowardice; and these indeed properly are the onely evils that are contrary to felicity and wisdom.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>Beati er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mus cum corporib&abus; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e lictis &amp; cupiditatu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &amp; aemu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a|tionum erimus expertes quod&abque; nunc facimus, cum laxati&abque; cu|ris sumus, ut spectare aliquid yelimus &amp; vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ere.</P>

And when <HI>Pomponius Atticus</HI> resolved to die by famine, to ease the great pains of his gout, in the abstinence of two dayes found his foot at ease: But when
<PB N="139" REF="98">
he began to feel the pleasures of an ap|proaching death, and the delicacies of that ease he was to inherit below, he would not withdraw his foot, but went on and fi|nished his death; and so did <HI>Cleanthes</HI>; and every wise man will despise the little evils of that state, which indeed is <HI>the daugh|ter of fear,</HI> but <HI>the mother of rest,</HI> and <HI>peace,</HI> and <HI>felicity.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. If God should say to us, Cast thy self into the Sea (as Christ did to S. <HI>Peter,</HI> or as God concerning <HI>Ionas</HI>) I have provided for thee a Dolphin, or a Whale, or a Port, a sa|fety or a deliverance, security or a reward, were we not incredulous and pusillanimous persons if we should tremble to put such a felicity into act, and our selves into possession? The very duty of resignation, and the love of our own interest are good antidores against fear. In fourty or fifty years we finde evils enough, and arguments enough to make us weary of this life: And to a good man there are very many more reasons to be afraid of life then death, this having in it lesse of evil and more of advantage. And it was a rare wish of that Roman, that death might come onely to wise and excellent per|sons,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><L>Mor utinam pavi|dos vita subducer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> nolle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></L>

<P N="6">6. Make no excuses to make thy desires of life seem reasonable; neither cover thy fear and pretences, but suppresse it rather, with arts of severity and ingenuity. Some are not willing to submit to Gods sentence and arrest
<PB N="140" REF="99">
of death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maneant opera in|terrupta, minae&abque; Murorum ingentes.</NOTE> till they have finished such a designe, or made an end of the last paragraph of their book, or raised such portions for their chil|dren, or preached so many sermons, or built their house, or planted their orchard, or or|dered their estate with such advantages; It is well for the modesty of these men that the ex|cuse is ready; but if it were not, it is certain they would search one out: for an idle man is never ready to die, and is glad of any ex|cuse; and a busied man hath alwayes some|thing unfinished, and he is ready for every thing but death: and I remember that <HI>Pe|tronius</HI> brings in <HI>Eumolpus</HI> composing verses in a desperate storm, and being called upon to shift for himself when the ship dashed upon the rock, cried out to let him alone till he had finished and trimmed his verse, which was lame in the hinder leg; the man either had too strong a desire to end his verse, or too great a desire not to end his life. But we must know Gods times are not to be measu|red by our circumstances; and what I value, God regards not, or if it be valuable in the accounts of men, yet God will supply it with other contingencies of his providence: and if <HI>Epaphroditus</HI> had died when he had his great sicknesse S. <HI>Paul</HI> speaks of, God would have secured the work of the Gospel without him, and he could have spared <HI>Epaphroditus</HI> as well as S. <HI>Stephen,</HI> and S. <HI>Peter,</HI> as well as S. <HI>Iames:</HI> Say no more, but when God calls, lay aside thy papers and first dresse thy soul, and then dresse thy hearse.</P>
<P>Blindnesse is odious, and widow-hood is sad, and destitution is without comfort, and persecution is full of trouble, and famine is
<PB N="141" REF="99">
intolerable, and tears are the sad ease of a sadder heart; but these are evils of our life, not of our death. For <HI>the dead that die in the Lord</HI> are so farre from wanting the commo|dities of this life, that they do not want life it self.</P>
<P>After all this, I do not say it is a sin to be afraid of death: we find the boldest spirit that discourses of it with confidence, and dares undertake a danger as big as death, yet doth shrink at the horror of it when it comes dressed in its proper circumstances; And <HI>Brutus</HI> who was as bold a Roman to undertake a noble action, as any was since they first reckoned by Consuls, yet when <HI>Fu|rius</HI> came to cut his throat after his defeat by <HI>Anthony,</HI> he ran from it like a girl, and being admonished to die constantly, <HI>he swore by his life,</HI> that he would shortly <HI>endure death.</HI> But what do I speak of such imperfect persons? Our B. Lord was pleased to legitimate fear to us, by his agony and prayers in the gar|den. It is not a sin to be afraid,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> but it is a great felicity to be without fear, which feli|city our dearest Saviour refused to have, be|cause it was agreeable to his purposes to suffer any thing that was contrary to felicity, every thing but sin. But when men will <HI>by all means</HI> avoid death, they are like those who <HI>at any hand</HI> resolve to be rich: The case may hap|pen in which they wil blaspheme, and dishonor providence, or do a base action, or <HI>curse God, and die</HI>: But in all cases they die miserable and insnared, and in no case do they die the lesse for it. Nature hath left us the key of the Churchyard, and custome hath brought Cae|meteries and charnell houses into Cities and

Churches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quam pellunt lachrymae fo|vent sor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">em: dura negant ce|dere mollibus.</NOTE> places most fre|quented, that we might not carry our selves strange|ly in so certain, so expe|cted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Siccas si videat genas Durae ced|et hebes sors pati|entiae.</NOTE> so ordinary, so unavoydable an acci|dent. All reluctancy or unwillingnesse to obey the Divine decree, is but a snare to our selves, and a load to our spirits, and is either an intire cause, or a great aggravation of the calamity.

<P>If all the parts of this discourse be true; if they be better then dreams, and unlesse <HI>vertue be nothing but words,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">virtutem verba pu+cas ut l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|cumligna</NOTE> <HI>as a grove is a heap of trees</HI>; if they be not the Phantasmes of hy|pochondriacall persons, and designes upon the interest of men, and their perswasions to evil purposes; then there is no reason, but that

If we had seen S. <HI>Policarp</HI> burning to death, or S. <HI>Laurence</HI> rosted upon his gridiron, or S. <HI>Ignatius</HI> exposed to lions, or S. <HI>Sebastion</HI> pierced with arrowes, or S. <HI>Attalus</HI> carried about the theatre with scorn unto his death for the cause of Jesus, for religion, for God and a holy conscience, we should have been in love with flames, and have thought the gridiron fairer then the <HI>spondae, the ribs of a maritall bed</HI>: and we should have chosen to converse with those beasts rather then those men that brought those beasts forth; and estimated the arrows to be the rayes of light brighter then the moon; and that disgrace and mistaken page|antry were a solemnity richer and more mag|ficent then <HI>Mordecai's</HI> procession upon the

Kings horse, and in the robes of majesty; for so did these holy men account them: they kissed their stakes, and hugged their deaths, and ran violently to torments, and counted whippings and secular disgraces to be the en|amel of their persons, and the ointment of their heads, and the embalming their names, and securing them for immortality. But to see <HI>Sejanus</HI> torne in pieces by the people, or <HI>Nero</HI> crying or creeping timorously to his death when he was condemned to dye <HI>more majorum,</HI> to see <HI>Iudas</HI> pale and trembling, full of anguish, sorrow and despair, to observe the groanings and intolerable agonies of <HI>Herod</HI> and <HI>Antiochus,</HI> will tell and demonstrate the causes of patience and impatience to proceed from the causes of the suffering; and it is sin onely that makes the cup bitter and deadly; when men by vomiting measure up the drink they took in,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi quicquid bi|berint vomitum remetientur tri|stes, &amp; bilem su|am regustantes. <HI>Senec.</HI></NOTE> and sick and sad do again taste their meat turned into choler by intemperance, the sin and its punish|ment are mingled so, that shame co|vers the face, and sorrow puts a veil of darknesse upon the heart, and we scarce pity a vile person that is haled to execution for murder or for treason, but we say he deserves it, and that every man is con|cerned in it that he should dye. If lust brought the sicknesse or the shame; if we truly suffer the reward of our evil deeds, we must thank our selves; that is, we are fallen into an evil condition, and are the sacrifice of the Divine justice. But if we live holy lives, and if we enter well in, we are sure to passe on safe, and to goe forth with advantage, <HI>if we list our selves.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="146" REF="102">2. To this relates, that <HI>we should not counter|feit sicknesse</HI>; For he that is to be carefull of his passage into a sicknesse will think himself concerned that he fall not into it through a trap door: for so it hath sometimes happened, that such counterfeiting, to light and evil pur|poses hath ended in a real sufferance: <HI>Appian</HI> tells of a Roman Gentleman, who to escape the proscription of the <HI>Triumvirate,</HI> fled, and to secure his privacy counterfeited himself blinde on one eye, and wore a plaister upon it, till beginning to be free from the malice of the three prevailing princes, he opened his hood, but could not open his eye, but for ever lost the use of it, and with his eye paid for his libertie and hypocrisie.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tantum cura po|test &amp; ars doloris desiit Cae+lius fin|gere po|dagram.

His arts of dissimulation were so witty that they put life and motion into the very image of the dis|ease; he made the very picture to sigh and groan.</P>
<P>It is easie to tell upon the interest of what vertue, such counterfeiting is to be reproved. But it will be harder to snatch the politicks of the world from following that which they call a canonized and authentick precedent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">: and <HI>Davids</HI> counterfeiting himself mad before the <HI>King of Gath,</HI> to save his life and liberty, wil be sufficient to entice men to serve an end upon the stock &amp; charges of so small an irregularity; not in the matter of manners, but in the rules and decencies of natural or civil deportment. I cannot certainly tell what degrees of excuse <HI>Davids</HI> action might put on. This onely: be|sides
<PB N="147" REF="102">
his present necessity; the Laws whose coercitive or directive power <HI>David</HI> lived un|der, had lesse of severity and more of liberty; and towards enemies had so little of restraint, and so great a power, that what amongst them was a direct sin, if used to their brethren the sons of <HI>Iacob,</HI> was lawfull and permitted to be acted against enemies. To which also I adde this general caution, that the actions of holy persons in Scripture are not alwayes good precedents to us Christians, who are to walk by a rule and a greater strictnesse, with more simplicity and heartinesse of pursuit. And amongst them, sanctity and holy living did in very many of its instances increase in new par|ticulars of duty; and the prophets reproved many things which the law forbad not, and taught many duties which <HI>Moses</HI> prescribed not; and as the time of Christs approach came, so the sermons and revelations too were more evangelical, and like the patterns which were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ully to be exhibited by the Son of God. Amongst which it is certain, that <HI>Christian simplicity</HI> and <HI>godly sincerity</HI> is to be accounted, * and counterfeiting of sicknesse is a huge enemy to this: * it is an upbraiding the Divine providence, * a jesting with fire, * a playing with a thunderbolt, * a making the decrees of God to serve the vitious or secular ends of men; * it is a tempting of a judgement, * a fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e accusation of God, * a forestalling and antidating his anger, * it is a cousening of men by making a God party in the fraud; and therefore if the cousenage returns upon the mans own head, he enters like a fox into his sicknesse, and perceives himself catched in a trap, or earthed in the
<PB N="148" REF="103">
intolerable dangers of the grave.</P>
<P N="3">3. Although we must be infinitely careful to prevent it, that sin does not thrust us into a sicknesse, yet when we are in the house of sorrow, we should do well to take Physick against sin, and suppose that it is the cause of the evil; if not by way of natural causa|lity and proper effect, yet by a moral influ|ence, and by a just demerit. We can easily see when a man hath got a surfet; intempe|rance is as plain as the hand writing upon the wall, and easier to be read: but covetousness may cause a Feaver as well as drunkennesse, and pride can produce a falling sickness as well as long washings, and dilutions of the brain, and intemperate lust: and we finde it record|ed in Scripture that the contemptuous and un|prepared manner of reception of the Holy Sacraments caused sicknesse and death; and <HI>Sacriledge</HI> and <HI>Vow-breach</HI> in <HI>Ananias</HI> and <HI>Sa|phira</HI> made them to descend quick into their graves. Therefore when sicknesse is upon us, let us cast about, and if we can, let us finde out the cause of Gods displeasure, that it be|ing removed, we may return into the health and securities of Gods loving kindnesse. Thus in the three years famine <HI>David</HI> enquired of the Lord what was the matter? and God an|swered, <HI>it is for Saul, and his bloody house</HI>: and then <HI>David</HI> expiated the guilt, and the peo|ple were full again of food and blessing: and when Israel was smitten by the <HI>Amorites, Io|shuah</HI> cast about, and found out the accursed thing, and cast it out, and the people after that fought prosperously. And what God in that case said to <HI>Ioshua,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Josh. 7.12.</NOTE> he will also verifie to us; <HI>I will not be with you any more unlesse you de|stroy
<PB N="149" REF="103">
the accursed thing from among you.</HI> But in pursuance of this we are to observe that al|though in case of loud and clamorous sins the discovery is easy and the remedie not di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fi|cult; yet because Christianity is a nice thing, and religion is as pure as the sun, and the soul of man is apt to be troubled from more prin|ciples then the in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ricate and curiosluy com|posed bodie in its innum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rable parts, it will often happen that if we go to enquire into the particular, we shall never finde it out: and we may suspect drunkennesse when it may be also a morose delectation in unclean thoughts, or covetousnesse, or oppression, or a crafty invasion of my neighbours rights, or my want of charity or my judging unjustly in my own cause, or my censuring my neighbours, or a secret pride, or a base hypocrisie, or the pursuance of little ends with violence and passion, that may have procured the present messenger of death. Therefore ask no more after any one, but heartily endeavour to re|form all:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Soph.</HI></NOTE> <HI>sin no more lest a worse thing happen,</HI> for a single search or accusation may be the designe of an imperfect repentance; but no man does heartily return to God, but he that decrees against every irregularity; and then onely we can be restored to health or life, when we have taken away the causes of sicknesse and a cursed death.</P>
<P N="4">4. He that means to have his sicknesse turn into safety and life, into health and vertue, must <HI>make religion the imployment of his sicknesse, and prayer the imployment of his religion.</HI> For there are certain <HI>compendiums</HI> or <HI>abbreviatures</HI> and shortnings of religion, fitted to several states. They that first gave up their names to
<PB N="150" REF="104">
Christ, and that turned from Paganism to Christianity had an abbreviature fitted for them; they were to renounce their false wor|shippings, and give up their belief, and vow their obedience unto Christ, and in the very profession of this they were forgiven in Ba|ptism. For God hastens to snatch them from the power of the Devil, and therefore shortens the passage, and secures the estate. In the case of poverty God hath reduced this dutie of man, to an abbreviature of those few graces which they can exercise; such as are pati|ence, contentednesse, truth, and diligence; and the rest he accepts in good will, and the charities of the soul, in prayers and the actions of a cheap religion. And to most men <HI>charity</HI> is also an <HI>abbreviature.</HI> And as the love of God shortens the way to the purchase of all vertues, so the expression of this to the poor, goes a huge way in the requisites, and towards the consummation of an excellent religion: and <HI>Martyrdom</HI> is another abbreviature: and so is every act of an excellent and heroical vertue. But when we are fallen into the state of sicknesse, and that our understanding is weak and troubled, our bodies sick and use|lesse, our passions turned into fear, and the whole state into suffering, God in complyance and mans infirmity hath also turned our reli|gion into such a duty, which a sick man can do most passionately, and a sad man and a timo|rous can perform effectually, and a dying man can do to many purposes of pardon and mer|cy, and that is, <HI>prayer.</HI> For although a sick man is bound to do many acts of vertue of se|veral kindes, yet the most of them are to be done <HI>in the way of prayer.</HI> Prayer is not onely
<PB N="151" REF="104">
the religion that is proper to a sick mans con|dition, but it is the manner of doing other graces which is then left, and in his power. For thus the sick man is to do his repentance, and his mortifications, his temperance and his chastity, by a fiction of imagination bringing the offers of the vertue to the spirit, &amp; making an action of election, and so our prayers are a direct act of chastity when they are made in the matter of that grace; just as repentance for our cruelty, is an act of the grace of <HI>mercie</HI>: and repentance for uncleannesse is an act of chastity, is a means of its purchase, an act in order to the habit: and though such acts of vertue which are onely <HI>in the way of prayer</HI> are ineffective to the intire purchase, and of them|selves cannot change the vice into vertue, yet they are good renewings of the grace, and proper exercise of a habit already gotten.</P>
<P>The purpose of this discourse is to repre|sent the excellency of prayer, and its proper advantages which it hath in the time of sick|nesse. For besides that it moves God to pity, piercing the clouds &amp; making the Heavens like a pricked eye to weep over us, and refresh us with showers of pity; it also doth the work of the soul, and expresses the vertue of his whole life <HI>in effigie,</HI> in pictures and lively represent|ments, so preparing it for a never ceasing crown, by renewing the actions in the con|tinuation of a never ceasing, a never hindred affection. Prayer speaks to God, when the tongue is stiffned with the approachings of death: prayer can dwell in the heart and be signified by the hand or eye, by a thought or a groan; prayer of all the actions of religion is the last alive, and it serves God without cir|cumstances,
<PB N="152" REF="105">
and exercises material graces by abstraction from matter, and separation, and makes them to be spiritual: and therefore best dresses our bodies for <HI>funeral, or recovery,</HI> for <HI>the mercies of restitution,</HI> or <HI>the mercies of the grave.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. In every sicknesse whether it will or will not be so in nature and in the event, yet in thy spirit and preparations resolve upon it, and treat thy self accordingly as if it were <HI>a sicknesse unto death.</HI> For many men support their unequall courages by flattery and false hopes, and because sicker men have recove|red, beleeve that they shall do so; but there|fore, they neglect to adorn their souls, or set their house in order; besides the temporall inconveniences that often happen by such perswasions and putting off the evil day, such as are, <HI>dying Intestate, leaving estates intangled,</HI> and <HI>some Relatives unprovided for,</HI> they suf|fer infinitely in the interest and affairs of their soul, they die carelesly and surprized, their burdens on, and their scruples unremoved, and their cases of conscience not determined, and like a sheep, without any care taken con|cerning their precious souls. Some men will never beleeve that a villain will betray them, though they receive often advices from sus|picious persons and likely accidents, till they are entered into the snare, and then they beleeve it when they feel it, and when they cannot return; but so the treason entred, and the man was betrayed by his own folly, pla|cing the snare in the regions and advantages of opportunity. This evil looks like <HI>boldnesse</HI> and <HI>a confident spirit,</HI> but it is the greatest
<PB N="153" REF="105">
timerousnesse and cowardize in the world. They are so fearfull to die, that they dare not look upon it as possible; and think that the making of a Will is a mortall signe, and send|ing for a spirituall man an irrecoverable di|sease, and they are so afraid lest they should think and beleeve <HI>now they must die,</HI> that they will not take care that it may not be evil <HI>in case they should.</HI> So did the Eastern slaves drink wine, and wrapt their heads in a vail, that they might die without sense or sorrow, and wink hard that they might sleep the easi|er. In pursuance of this rule let a man con|sider, that whatsoever must be done in sick|nesse ought to be done in health; onely let him observe that his sicknesse as a good mo|nitor chastises his neglect of duty, and forces him to live as he alwayes should; and then all <HI>these solemnities and dressings for death,</HI> are no|thing else but the part of <HI>a religious life,</HI> which he ought to have exercised all his dayes; and if those circumstances can affright him, let him please his fancy by this truth, that then he does but begin to live. But it will be a huge folly if he shall think that confession of his sins will kill him, or receiving the holy Sacrament will hasten his <HI>agony,</HI> or the Priest shall undo all the hopefull language and pro|mises of his Physitian. <HI>Assure thy self thou canst not die the sooner; But by such addresses thou mayest die much the better.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Let the sick person be infinitely carefull that he do not fall into a state of death upon a new account</HI>; that is, at no hand commit a delibe|rate sin, or retain any affection to the old; for in both cases he falls into the evils of a
<PB N="154" REF="106">
surprize, and the horrors of a sudden death. For a sudden death is but a sudden joy, if it takes a man in the state and exercises of vertue: and it is onely then an evil when it finds a man unready. They were sad depar|tures when <HI>Tegillinus, Cornelius Gallus</HI> the Praetor, <HI>Lewis</HI> the son of <HI>Gonzaga Duke of Mantua, Ladislaus king of Naples, Speusippus, Giachettus of Geneva,</HI> and one of the Popes died in the forbidden embraces of abused women; or if <HI>Iob</HI> had cursed God and so died; or when a man sits down in despair, and in the accusation and calumny of the Di|vine mercy; they make their night sad, and stormy and eternall. When <HI>Herod</HI> began to sink with the shamefull torment of his bowels, and felt the grave open under him, he impri|soned the Nobles of his Kingdom, and com|manded his Sister that they should be a sacri|fice to his departing ghost. This was an egresse fit onely for such persons who meant to dwell with Devils to eternall ages, and that man is hugely in love with sin who cannot forbear, in the week of the Assizes, and when himself stood at the barre of scrutiny and prepared for his finall, never to be reversed sentence. He dies suddenly to the worst sense and event of sudden death, who so manages his sicknesse that even that state shall not be innocent, but that he is surprized in the guilt of a new account. It is a signe of a reprobate spirit, and an habituall prevailing, ruling sin, which exacts obedience when the judge|ment looks him in the face. At least go to God with the innocence and fair deport|ment of thy person in the last scene of thy life,
<PB N="155" REF="106">
that when thy soul breaks into the state of separation, it may carry the relishes of religion and sobriety to the places of its abode and sentence.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><L>Who so him bethost</L>

<P N="7">7. When these things are taken care for,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inscript. marmori in Ecclos|paroch de Feversham in a|gro Cantiano.</NOTE> let the sick man so order his af|fairs that he have but very little conversation with the world, but wholly (as he can) attend to re|ligion, and antedate his conversation in hea|ven, alwayes having entercourse with God, and still conversing with the Holy Jesus, kis|sing his wounds, admiring his goodnesse, beg|ing his mercy, feeding on him with faith, and drinking his blood, to which purpose it were very fit (if all circumstances be answerable) that the narrative of the passion of Christ be read or discoursed to him at length, or in brief according to the stile of the four Gospels.

<HEAD>SECT. I. Of the practise of Patience.</HEAD>
<P>NOw we suppose the man entring up|on his Scene of sorrows, and <HI>pas|sive graces:</HI> It may be he went yesterday to a wedding, merry and brisk, and there he felt his sen|tence, that he must return home and die. For men very commonly enter into the snare <HI>singing,</HI> and consider not whither their fate leads them; nor feared that then the Angel was to strike his stroak; till his knees kissed the earth, and his head trembles with the weight of the rod, which God put into the hand of an exterminating Angel. But what|soever the ingresse was, when the man feels his blood boil, or his bones weary, or his flesh
<PB N="157" REF="107">
diseased with a load of a dispersed and disor|dered humour, or his head to ake, or his facul|ties discomposed, then he must consider that all those discourses he hath heard concerning patience and resignation, and conformity to Christs sufferings, and the melancholy lectures of the Crosse, must all of them now be redu|ced to practise, and passe from an ineffective contemplation to such an exercise as will re|ally try whether we were true disciples of the Crosse, or onely beleeved the doctrines of religion when we were at ease, and that they never passed thorow the ear to the heart, and dwelt not in our spirits. But every man should consider God does nothing in vain, that he would not to no purpose send us Preachers, and give us rules, and furnish us with discourse, and lend us books, and pro|vide Sermons, and make examples, and pro|mise his Spirit, and describe the blessednesse of holy sufferings, and prepare us with daily alarums; if he did not really purpose to or|der our affairs so that we should need all this, and use it all, there were no such thing as the grace of patience if we were not to feel a sick|nesse, or enter into a state of sufferings; whe|ther when we are entred, we are to practise by the following rules.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>The practise and acts of patience by way of rule.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. At the first addresse and presence of sicknesse, <HI>stand still and arrest thy spirit,</HI> that it may without amazement, or affright consider that this was that thou lookedst for, and were
<PB N="158" REF="108">
alwayes certain should happen, and that now thou art to enter into the actions of a new re|ligion, the agony of a strange constitution; but at no hand suffer thy spirits to be disper|sed with fear, or wildnesse of thought, but stay their loosenesse and dispersion by a seri|ous consideration of the present and future imployment. For so doth the Lybian Lion spying the fierce huntsman, first beats himself with the stroaks of his tail, and curles up his spirits, making them strong with union and recollection, till being strook with a Mauri|tanian spear, he rushes forth into his defence and noblest contention; and either scapes in|to the secrets of his own dwelling, or else dies, the bravest of the forrest: Every man when shot with an arrow from Gods quiver, must then draw in all the auxiliaries of reason, and know, that then is the time to try his strength, and to reduce the words of his reli|gion into action, and consider that if he be|haves himself weakly and timerously, he suf|fers never the lesse of sicknesse; but if he turns to health he carries along with him the mark of a coward and a fool; and if he descends into his grave, he enters into the state of the <HI>faithlesse</HI> and <HI>unbeleevers.</HI> Let him set his heart firm upon this resolution, <HI>I must bear it inevita|bly; and I will by Gods grace do it nobly.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Bear in thy sicknesse all along the same thoughts, propositions, and discourses concerning thy person, thy life, and death, thy soul and reli|gion, which thou hadst in the best dayes of thy health, and when thou didst discourse wisely con|cerning things spirituall.</HI> For it is to be suppo|sed (and if it be not yet done, let this rule remind thee of it, and direct thee) that thou
<PB N="159" REF="108">
hast cast about in thy health and considered concerning thy change, and <HI>the evil day,</HI> that thou must be sick and die, that you must need a comforter, and that it was certain thou shouldst fall into a state in which all the cords of thy anchor should be stretched, and the very rock and foundation of faith should be attempted; and whatsoever fancies may di|sturb you, or whatever weaknesses may invade you, yet consider, when you were better able to judge and governe the accidents of your life, you concluded it necessary to trust in God, and possesse your souls with patience. Think of things as they think that stand by you, and as you did when you stood by others, that it is a blessed thing to be patient,, that a quiet|nesse of spirit hath a certain reward, that still there is infinite truth and reality in the pro|mises of the Gospel, that still thou art in the care of God, in the condition of a son, and <HI>working out thy salvation</HI> with labour and pain, <HI>with fear and trembling,</HI> that now the Sun is under a cloud, but it still sends forth the same influence; and be sure to make no new prin|ciples upon the stock of a quick and an impa|tient sense, or too busie an apprehension: keep your old principles, and upon their stock discourse and practise on towards your con|clusion.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Resolve to bear your sicknesse like a child,</HI> that is, without considering the evils and the pains, the sorrows and the danger; but go straight forward, and let thy thoughts cast about for nothing, but how to make ad|vantages of it by the instrument of religion. He that from a high tower looks down upon the precipice and measures the space through
<PB N="160" REF="109">
which he must descend, and considers what a huge fall he shall have, shall feel more by the horror of it, then by the last dash on the pavement: and he that tells his groans and numbers his sighs, and reckons one for every gripe of his belly, or throb of his distem|pered pulse, will make an <HI>artificiall sicknesse</HI> greater then the <HI>naturall</HI>; and if thou beest ashamed that a childe should bear an evil better then thou, then take his instrument and allay thy spirit with it.; reflect not upon thy evil, but contrive as much as you can for duty, and in all the rest, <HI>inconsideration</HI> will ease your pain.</P>
<P N="4">4. If thou fearest thou shalt need; ob|serve and draw together all such things as are apt to charm thy spirit, and ease thy fancy in the sufferance. It is the counsell of <HI>Socrates</HI>:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE> <HI>It is</HI> (said he) <HI>a great danger, and you must by discourse and arts of reasoning inchant it into slum|ber and some rest.</HI> It may be thou wert moved much to see a person of honour to die un|timely; or thou didst love the religion of that death bed, and it was dressed up in cir|cumstances fitted to thy needs, and hit thee on that part, where thou wert most sensible; or some little saying in a Sermon, or passage of a book was chosen and singled out by a peculiar apprehension, and made consent lodge a while in thy spirit, even then when thou didst place death in thy meditation, and didst view it in all its dresse of fancy: what|soever that was which at any time did please thee in thy most passionate and fantastic part, let not that go, but bring it home at that time especially; because then thou art in thy weaknesse, such little things will easier
<PB N="161" REF="109">
move thee then a more severe discourse and a better reason. For a sick man is like a scru|pulous: his case is gone beyond the cure of arguments, and it is <HI>a trouble</HI> that can onely be helped by chance, or a lucky saying; and <HI>Ludovico Corbinelli</HI> was moved at the death of <HI>Henry the second</HI> more then if he had read the saddest Elegy of all the unfortunate Princes in Christendom, or all the sad sayings of Scripture, or the threnes of the funerall pro|phets. I deny not, but this course is most proper to weak persons; but it is a state of weaknesse for which we are now providing re|medies and instruction; a strong man will not need it: But when our sicknesse hath rendred us weak in all senses, it is not good to refuse a remedy, because it supposes us to be sick. But then if to the Catalogue of weak persons we adde all those who are ruled by fancy, we shall find that <HI>many persons in their health,</HI> and <HI>more in their sicknesse,</HI> are under the dominion of fancy, and apt to be helped by those lit|tle things, which themselves have found fit|ted to their apprehension; and which no o|ther man can minister to their needs, unlesse by chance, or in a heap of other things. But therefore every man should remember by what instruments he was at any time much moved, and try them upon his spirit in the day of his calamity.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Do not choose the kind of thy sicknesse, or the manner of thy death</HI>; but let it be what God please, so it be no greater then thy spirit, or thy patience: and for that, you are to re|ly upon the promise of God; and to secure thy self by prayer and industry; but in all things else, let God be thy chooser, and let

it be thy work to submit indifferently, and at|tend thy duty. It is lawfull to beg of God that thy sicknesse may not be sharp, or noy|some, infectious or unusuall, because these are circumstances of evil which are also proper in|struments of temptation; and though it may well concern the prudence of thy religion to fear thy self, and keep thee from violent tem|ptations, who hast so often fallen in little ones; yet even in these things be sure to keep some degrees of indifferency; that is, if God will not be intreated to ease thee, or to change thy triall, then be importunate that thy spirit and its interest be secured, and <HI>let him do what seemeth good in his eyes</HI>; but as in the degrees of sicknesse thou art to submit to God; so in the kind of it, (supposing equall degrees) thou art to be altogether incurious; whether God call thee by a consumption or an asth|ma, by a dropsey or a palsey, by a feaver in thy humours, or a feaver in thy spirits, because all such nicety of choice is nothing but a co|lour to legitimate impatience, and to make an excuse to murmure privately, and for circum|stances, when in the summe of affairs we durst not owne impatience. I have known some per|sons vehemently wish that they might die of a consumption, and some of these had a plot up|on heaven, and hoped by that means to secure it after a carelesse life; as thinking a lingring sicknesse would certainly infer a lingring and a protracted repentance; and by that means they thought they should be safest; others of them dreamed it would be an easier death, and have found themselves deceived, and their patience hath been tired with a weary spirit and a uselesse body, by often conversing with

<HEAD>SECT. III. Of the practise of the grace of Faith in the time of sicknesse.</HEAD>
<P>NOw is the time in which faith appears most necessary and most difficult. It is the foundation of a good life; and the foun|dation of all our hopes; it is that without which we cannot live well, and without which we cannot die well; it is a grace that then we shall need, to support our spirits to sustain our hopes, to alleviate our sickesse, to resist tem|ptations, to prevent despair: upon the belief of the articles of our religion we can do the works of a holy life; but upon belief of the promises, we can bear our sicknesse patiently and die cheerfully. The sick man may practise it in the following instances.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Let the sick man be careful that he do not admit of any doubt concerning that which he be|leeved, and received from common consent in his best health and dayes of election and religion.</HI> For if the Devil can but prevail so far as to unfix and unrivet the resolution and confidence or fulnesse of assent, it is easie for him so to un|winde the spirit, that from <HI>why</HI> to <HI>whether or no,</HI> from <HI>whether or no,</HI> to <HI>scarcely not,</HI> from <HI>scarcely not,</HI> to <HI>absolutely not at all</HI> are steps of a descending and falling spirit: and whatso|ever a man is made to doubt of by the weak|nesse of his understanding in a sicknesse, it will be hard to get an instrument strong or subtle
<PB N="179" REF="118">
enough to reenforce and ensure; For when the strengths are gone by which faith held, and it does not stand firme by the weight of its own bulk and great constitution, nor yet by the cordage of a tenacious root, then it is prepared for a ruine, which it cannot escape in the tempests of a sicknesse and the assaults of a Devil. * Discourse and argument, * the line of tradition, and a never * failing experience, * the Spirit of God and the * truth of mira|cles, * the word of prophecie, * and the blood of Martyrs, * the excellencie of the doctrine and * the necessity of men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Non jam validi, radicibus haerens Pondere fixa suo.</NOTE> * the riches of the promises, * and the wisdom of the revelations, * the reasonablenesse and * sublimity, the * concordance and the * use|fulnesse of the articles, and * their comply|ance with all the needs of man, * and the go|verment of common wealths, are like the strings and branches of the roots, by which faith stands firm and unmoveable in the spirit, and understanding of a man. But in sicknesse the understanding is shaken and the ground is removed in which the root did grapple, and support its trunk, and therefore there is no way now, but that it be left to stand upon the old confidences, and by the firmament of its own weight; it must be left to stand because it alwayes stood there before:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sancti|us&abque; ac reveren|tius vi|sum de actis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|orum credere quam sci|re. facit</NOTE> and as it stood all his life time in the <HI>ground of understanding,</HI> so it must now be supported with <HI>will</HI> and a <HI>fixed resolution.</HI> But disputation tempts it, and shakes it with trying, and overthrowes it with shaking.

<HEAD>SECT. V. Of the practise of the Grace of Repen|tance in time of the Sicknesse.</HEAD>
<P>MEn generally do very much dread sud|den death, and pray against it passio|nately; and certainly it hath in it great in|conveniences accidentally to mens estates, to the settlement of families, to the culture and trimming of souls, and it robs a man of the blessings which may be consequent to sickness, and to the passive graces, and holy contentions of a Christian,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Desce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">li sti ad O+lympia sed ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o praeter te: coronam habes, victori|am non habes.</NOTE> while he descends to his grave without an adversary or a tryal: and a good man may be taken at such a disadvantage, that a sudden death would be a great evil, even to the most excellent person, if it strikes him in an unlucky circumstance: But these considerations are not the onely ingredients into those mens discourse, who pray violently against sudden deaths; for possibly if this were all, there may be in the condition of sudden death something to make recompence for the evils of the over-hasty accident. For certainly, it is a lesse temporal evil to fall by the rudenesse of a sword, then the violences of a Feaver, and the axe is much a lesse affli|ction then a strangury; and though a sicknesse tries our vertues, yet a sudden death is free from temptation: a sicknesse may be more glorious and a sudden death more safe; <HI>the deadest deaths are best,</HI> the shortest and

<P>But the secret of this affair is a worse matter; men live at that rate; either of an habitual wickednesse, or else a frequent repetition of single acts of killing and deadly sins, that a sudden death is the ruine of all their hopes, and a perfect consignation to an eternal sor|row. But in this case also, so is a lingring sick|nesse; for our last sicknesse may change us from life to health, from health to strength, from strength to the firmnesse and confirmation of habitual graces; but it cannot change a man from death to life, and begin and finish that processe which sits not down but in the bosom of blessednesse. He that washes in the morning when his bath is seasonable and healthful is not onely made clean, but spright|ly, and the blood is brisk and coloured like the first springing of the morning; but they that wash their dead, cleanse the skin, and leave palenesse upon the cheek, and stiffnesse in all the joynts.

<P>When God made man and propounded to him an immortal and a blessed state, as the end of his hopes and the perfection of his condition, he did not give it him for nothing, but upon certain conditions, which although they could add nothing to God, yet they were such things which man could value, and they were his best: and God had made appetites of pleasure in man, that in them the scene of his obedience should lye. For when God made instances of mans obedience, he 1. either commanded such things to be done, which man did naturally desire, or 2. such things which did contradict his natural desires, or 3. such which were indiffe|rent. Not the first and the last. For it could be no effect of love or duty towards God for a man to eat when he was impatiently hungry, and could not stay from eating; neither was it any contention of obedience or labour of love for a man to look Eastward once a day, or turn his back when the North winde blew fierce and loud. Therefore for the trial and instance of obedience, God made his laws so, that they should lay restraint upon mans ap|petites; so that man might part with some|thing

of his own, that he may give to God his will, and deny it to himself for the interest of his service; and chastity is the denyall of a vio|lent desire, and justice is parting with money that might help to inrich me, and meekness is a huge contradiction to pride and revenge; and the wandring of our eyes, and the greatnesse of our fancy, and our imaginative opinions are to be lessened, that we may serve God; there is no other way of serving God, we have no|thing else to present unto him; we do not else give him any thing or part of our selves, but when we for his sake part with what we naturally desire; and difficulty is essential to vertue, and without choice there can be no re|ward, &amp; in the satisfaction of our natural desires there is no election, we run to them as beasts to the river or the crib. If therefore any man shall teach or practise such a religion that satisfies all our natural desires in the dayes of desire and passion, of lust and appetites, and only turns to God when his appetites are gone, &amp; his desires cease, this man hath overthrown the very be|ing of vertues, and the essential constitution of religion; Religion is no religion, and ver|tue is no act of choice, and reward comes by chance and without condition, if we onely are religious when we cannot choose, if we part with our money when we cannot keep it, with our lust when we cannot act it, with our desires when they have left us;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><L>Cogimur a suetis animum sus|pendere rebus,</L>

How many dayes and nights have we spent in sorrow or care, in habitual and actual pursuances of vertue? what instrument we have chosen and used for the eradication of sin? how we have judged our selves, and how punished? and in summe whether we have by the grace of repentance changed our life from criminal to vertuous, from one habit to an|other? and whether we have paid for the pleasure of our sin by smart, or sorrow, by the effusion of alms, or pernoctations or a|bodes in prayers, so as the spirit hath been served in our repentance, as earnestly, and as greatly as our appetites have been provided for in the dayes of our shame and folly?</P>
<P N="3">3. Supply the imperfections of thy repen|tance by a general or universal sorrow, for the sins not onely since the last communion or ab|solution, but of thy whole life; for all sins known and unknown, repented and unre|pented, of ignorance or infirmity, which thou knowest, or which others have accu|sed thee of; thy clamorous and thy whis|pering sins, the sinnes of scandall, and the sinnes of a secret conscience, of the flesh and of the spirit: for it would be but a sad arrest to thy soul wandring in strange and unusuall regions to see a scroll of un|cancelled sins represented and charged upon thee for want of care and notices, and that thy repentance shall become invalid, because of its imperfections.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="167" REF="127">4. To this purpose it is usually advised by spirituall persons, that <HI>the sick man make an universal confession,</HI> or a renovation and re|petition of all the particular confessions and accusations of his whole life; that now at the foot of his account he may represent the summe totall to God, and his consci|ence, and make provisions for their reme|die and pardon according to his present pos|sibilities.</P>
<P N="5">5. Now is the time to <HI>make reflex acts of repentance</HI>; that as by a general repentance we supply the want of the just extension of parts: so by this we may supply the proper measures of the intension of degrees. In our health we can consider concerning our own acts whether they be real or hypocri|tical, essential or imaginary, sincere or up|on interest, integrall or imperfect, commen|surate or defective, and although it is a good caution of securities after all our care and diligence still to suspect our selves, and our own deceptions, and for ever to beg of God pardon and acceptance in the union of Christs passion, and intercession; yet in proper speaking, reflex acts of repentance, being a suppletory after the imperfection of the direct, are then most fit to be used when we cannot proceed in, and prosecute the direct actions. To repent because we cannot repent, and to grieve because we can|not grieve, was a device invented to serve the turn of the mother of <HI>Peter Gratian</HI>; but it was used by her, and so advised to be in her sicknesse, and last actions of repentance: for in our perfect health and understand|ing if we doe not understand our first act,
<PB N="198" REF="128">
we cannot discern our second; and if we be not sorry for our sins, we cannot be sorry for want of sorrows; it is a contradiction to say we can; because want of sorrow to which we are obliged is certainly a great sin; and if we can grieve for that, then also for the rest; if not for all, then not for this: but in the dayes of weaknesse the case is otherwise; for then our actions are imperfect, our dis|course weak, our internall actions not discern|able, our fears great, our work to be abbre|viated, and our defects, to be supplied by spi|rituall arts; and therefore it is proper and proportionate to our state, and to our necessi|ty, to beg of God pardon for the imperfecti|ons of our repentance, acceptance of our weaker sorrows, supplies out of the treasures of grace, and mercy; and thus repenting of the evil and unhandsome adherencies of our repentance, in the whole integrity of the duty, it will become <HI>a repentance not to be re|pented of.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Now is the time beyond which the sick man must <HI>at no hand defer to make restitu|tion of all his unjust possessions,</HI> or other mens rights,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ou pon|dre, ou rendre, ou les peines denfers attendre.</NOTE> and satisfactions for all injuries, and violencies according to his obligation, and possibilities; for although many circumstan|ces might impede the acting it in our lives|time, and it was permitted to be deferred in many cases, because by it, justice was not hindred, and oftentimes piety and equity were provided for; yet because this is the last scene of our life, he that does not act it so far as he can, or put it into certain conditions and or|der of effecting, can never do it again, and therefore then to defer it, is to omit it, and
<PB N="199" REF="128">
leaves the repentance defective in an integrall and constituent part.</P>
<P N="7">7. Let the sick man be diligent and watch|full, that the principle of his repentance be <HI>contrition,</HI> or sorrow for sins, commenced up|on the love of God. For although sorrow for sins upon any motive may lead us to God by many intermediall passages, and is the thre|shold of returning sinners, yet it is not good, nor effective upon our death-bed; because repentance is not then to begin, but must then be finished, and completed, and it is to be a supply and reparation of all the imperfecti|ons of that duty: and therefore it must by that time be arrived to <HI>contrition,</HI> that is, it must have grown from fear to love, from the passions of a servant, to the affections of a son; The reason of which (besides the precedent) is this, because when our repentance is in this state, it supposes the man also in a state of grace, a well grown Christian; for to hate sin out of the love of God is not the felicity of a new convert, or an infant grace (or if it be, that love also is in its infancy) but it supposes a good progresse, and the man habitually ver|tuous, and tending to perfection: and there|fore contrition, or repentance so qualified, is usefull to great degrees of pardon, because the man is a gracious person, and that vertue is of good degree, and consequently fit imploy|ment for him that shall work no more, but is to appear before his Judge to receive the hire of his day. And if his repentance be contri|tion, even before this state of sicknesse, let it be increased by spirituall arts; and the proper exercises of charity.</P>

<HEAD>Means of exciting contrition, or repent|ance of sins, proceeding from the love of God.</HEAD>
<P>TO which purpose the sick man may con|sider, and is to be reminded (if he does not) that there are in God, all the motives and causes of amability in the world; that God is so infinitely good, that there are some of the greatest and most excellent spirits of heaven, whose work, and whose felicity, and whose perfections, and whose nature it is, to flame and burn in the brightest and most excellent love * that to love God is the greatest glory of Heaven, that in him there are such excel|lencies, that the smallest rayes of them com|municated to our weaker understandings are yet sufficient to cause ravishments and tran|sportations, and satisfactions, and <HI>joyes un|speakeable, and full of glory</HI> * that all the wise Christians of the world know and feel such causes to love God that they all professe them|selves ready to die for the love of God * and the Apostles and millions of the Martyrs did die for him * And although it be harder to live in his love then to die for it, yet all the good people that ever gave their names to Christ did for his love endure the crucifying their lusts, the mortification of their appe|tites, the contradictions and death of their most passionate, naturall desires * that Kings and Queens have quitted their Diadems, and many married Saints have turned their mutu|all vowes into the love of Jesus, and married him onely, keeping a virgin chastity in a mar|ried

life, that they may more tenderly expresse their love to God * that all the good we have, derives from Gods love to us, and all the good we can hope for is the effect of his love, and can descend onely upon them that love him * that by his love it is that we receive the holy Jesus * and by his love we receive the Holy Spirit, * and by his love we feel peace and joy within our spirits * and by his love we receive the mysterious Sacrament * And what can be greater, then that from the good|nesse and love of God, we receive Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost, and Adoption, and the inheritance of sons, and to be co|heirs with Jesus, and to have pardon of our sins, and a divine nature, and restraining grace, and the grace of sanctification, and a rest and peace within us, and a certain expectati|on of glory, * who can choose but love him, who when we had provoked him exceeding|ly sent his Son to die for us, that we might live with him; who does so desire to pardon us and save us, that he hath appointed his Holy Son continually to intercede for us? *That his love is so great that he offers us great kind|nesse, and intreats us to be happy, and makes many decrees in heaven concerning the inter|est of our soul, and the very provision and support of our persons * That he sends an Angel to attend upon every of his servants, and to be their guard, and their guide, in all their dangers and hostilities * That for our sakes he restrains the Devil, and puts his mightinesse in fetters and restraints, and cha|stises his malice with decrees of grace and safety * That he it is who makes all the crea|tures serve us, and takes care of our sleeps,

and preserves all plants and elements, all mi|neralls and vegetables, all beasts and birds, all fishes and <HI>insects</HI> for food to us, and for ornament, for physick and instruction, for va|riety and wonder, for delight and for religi|on * That as God is all good in himself, and all good to us, so sin is directly contrary to God, to reason, to religion, to safety and pleasure, and felicity * That it is a great dishonour to a mans spirit to have been made a fool, by a weak temptation, and an empty lust; and to have rejected God, who is so rich, so wise, so good, and so excellent, so delici|ous, and so profitable to us * That all the repentance in the world of excellent men does end in contrition, or a sorrow for sins proceeding from the love of God; because they that are in the state of grace do not fear hell violently, and so long as they remain in Gods favour, although they suffer the infir|mities of men, yet they are Gods portion, and therefore all the repentance of just and holy men which is certainly the best, is a re|pentance not for lower ends but because they are the friends of God, and they are full of in|dignation that they have done an act against the honour of their Patron, and their dearest Lord and Father * That it is a huge imper|fection and a state of weaknesse, to need to be moved with fear or temporall respects, and they that are so, as yet are either im|merged in the affections of the world, or of themselves; and those men that bear such a character, are not yet esteemed laudable per|sons, or men of good natures, or the sons of vertue. * That no repentance can be lasting, that relies upon any thing but the love of
<PB N="203" REF="130">
God; for temporal motives may cease, and con|trary contingencies may arise, and fear of hell, may be expelled by natural or acquired hard|nesses, and is alwayes the least when we have most need of it, and most cause for it; for the more habitual our sins are, the more caute|rized&punc; our conscience is, the lesse is the fear of hell, and yet our danger is much the greater, * that although fear of hell or other temporal motives may be the first inlet to a repentance, yet repentance in that constitution and under those circumstances cannot obtain pardon; because there is in that no union with God, no adhesion to Christ, no endeerment of pas|sion, or of spirit, no similitude, or con|formity to the great instrument of our peace, our glorious Mediatour: for as yet a man is turned from his sin, but not converted to God; the first and last of our returns to God being love, and nothing but love: for obedience is the first part of love, and fruition is the last, and because he that does not love God cannot obey him, therefore he that does not love him cannot enjoy him.</P>
<P>Now that this may he reduced to practise, the sick man may be advertised that in the actions of repentance * he separate low, temporal, sensual, and self ends from his thoughts, and so do his repentance * that he may still reflect honour upon God; * that he confesse his justice in punishing, that he ac|knowledge himself to have deserved the worst of evils, * that he heartily believe and pro|fesse, that if he perish finally, yet that God ought to be glorified by that sad event, and that he hath truly merited so intolerable a ca|lamity, * that he also be put to make acts of
<PB N="204" REF="131">
election and preference; professing that he would willingly endure all temporal evils ra|ther then be in the disfavour of God or in the state of sin; for by this last instance he will be quitted from the suspicion of leaving sin, for temporal respects, because he by an act of imagination or fained presence of the object to him, entertains the temporal evil that he may leave the sin; and therefore unlesse he be a hypocrite does not leave the sin to be quit of the temporal evil. And as for the other motive of leaving sin our of the fear of hell, because that is an evangelical motive convey|ed to us by the spirit of God, and is immedi|ate to the love of God; if the Schoolmen had pleased, they might have reckoned it as the hand-maid, and <HI>of the retinue of contrition</HI>; but the more the considerations are sublimed above this, of the greater effect and the more immediate to pardon will be the repen|tance.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Let the sick persons do frequent acti|ons of repentance by way of prayer, for all those sins which are spiritual, and in which no restitu|tion or satisfaction material can be made, and whose contrary acts cannot in kinde be exercised.</HI> For penitential prayers in some cases are the only instances of repentance that can be. An en|vious man, if he gives God hearty thanks for the advancement of his brother, hath done an act of mortification of his envy, as directly as corporal austerities are an act of chastity, and an enemy to uncleanness: and if I have se|duced a person that is dead or absent, if I can|not restore him to sober counsels by my dis|course and undeceiving him, I can onely re|pent of that by way of prayer: and intempe|rance
<PB N="205" REF="131">
is no way to be rescinded or punished <HI>by a dying man</HI> but by hearty prayers. Prayers are a great help in all cases; in some they are proper acts of vertue and direct enemies to sin; but although alone and in long con|tinuance, they alone can cure some one or some few little habits, yet they can never alone change the state of the man; and therefore are intended to be a suppletory to the imper|fections of other acts; and by that reason are the proper and most pertinent imployment of a <HI>Clinick</HI> or <HI>death-bed penitent.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. In those sins whose proper cure is <HI>mor|tification corporal,</HI> the sick man is to supply that part of his repentance by a patient submission to the rod of sicknesse: For sicknesse does the work of penances or sharp afflictions, and dry diet, perfectly well: to which if we also put our wills, and make it our act by an after election, by confessing the justice of God, by bearing if sweetly, by begging it may be medicinal, there is nothing wanting to the perfection of this part,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quid de|bent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aesi a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ere u <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> rei ad paenam confugi|unt?</NOTE> but that God confirme our patience and hear our prayers. <HI>When the</HI> guilty man runs to punishment, the injured person is prevented and hath no whither to go but to forgivenesse.</P>
<P N="10">10. I have learned but of one suppletory more, for the perfection and proper exercise of a sick mans repentance; but it is such a one as will go a great way in the abolition of our past sinnes, and making our peace with God, even after a lesse severe life: and that is, that the sick man do some heroical actions in the matter of charity, or religion, of justice or severity. There is a story of an infamous thief who having begged his pardon
<PB N="206" REF="132">
of the Emperor <HI>Mauritius</HI> was yet put into the Hospital of S. <HI>Sampson</HI> where he so plenti|fully bewailed his sins in the last agonies of his death, that the Physitian who attended found him unexpectedly dead, and over his face a handkerchief bathed in tears, and soon after some body or other pretended to a revelation of this mans beatitude. It was a rare grief that was noted in this man, which begat in that age a confidence of his being saved, and <HI>that confidence</HI> (as things then went) was quick|ly called <HI>a revelation.</HI> But it was a stranger se|verity which is related by <HI>Thomas Cantipratanus</HI> concerning a young Gentleman condemned for robbery and violence, who had so deep a sense of his sin, that he was not content with a single death, but begged to be tormented and cut in pieces joynt by joynt, with inter|medial senses, that he might by such a smart signifie a greater sorrow; Some have given great estates to the poor and to religion; some have built colledges for holy persons, many have suffered martyrdom, and though those that died under the conduct of the <HI>Mac|cabees</HI> in defence of their countrey and reli|gion, had pendants on their breasts conse|crated to the idols of the <HI>Iamnenses,</HI> yet that they gave their lives in such a cause with so great a duty, (the biggest things they could do or give) it was esteemed to prevail hugely towards the pardon and acceptation of their persons. An heroic action of uertue is a huge compendium of religion; for if it be attained to by the usual measures and progresse of a Christian, from inclination to act, from act to habit, from habit to abode, from abode to reigning, from reigning to perfect possession,
<PB N="207" REF="132">
from possession to extraordinary emanations, that is, to heroick actions, then it must needs do the work of man, by being so great to|wards the work of God; but if a man comes thither <HI>per saltum,</HI> or on a sudden (which is seldome seen) then it supposes the man alwayes well inclined, but abused by accident or hope, by confidence or ignorance; taen it supposes the man for the present in a great fear of evil, and a passionate desire of pardon; it supposes his apprehensions great, and his time little; and what the event of that will be, no man can tell; but it is certain that <HI>to some purposes</HI> God will account for our religion on our death bed, not by the mea|sures of our time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vera ad Deum conversio in ultim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> positorum mente po|tius est aesti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">anda quam tem|pore. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">el p. ep. 2. c. .vera conversio) scil. ab insi delitate ad fidem <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hristi per Baptis|mum.</NOTE> but the eminency of affection (as said <HI>Celestin</HI> the first) that is, supposing the man in the state of grace, or in the re|vealed possibility of salva|tion, then an heroical act hath the reward of a longer series of good actions, in an even and ordinary course of vertue.</P>

<P>O Most just and most mercifull Lord God, who hast sent evil diseases, sorrow, &amp; fear, trouble and uneasinesse, briars and thorns into the world, and planted them in our houses,
<PB N="215" REF="136">
and round about our dwellings to keep sin from our souls or to drive it thence, I hum|bly beg of thee that this my sicknesse may serve the ends of the Spirit, and be a messen|ger of spirituall life, an instrument of redu|cing me to more religious and sober courses; I know O Lord, that I am unready and unpre|pared in my accounts, having thrown away great portions of my time in vanity, and set my self hugely back in the accounts of eter|nity; and I had need live my life over again, and live it better; but thy counsels are in the great deep, and thy footsteps in the water; and I know not what thou wilt determine of me. If I die, I throw my self into the arms of the Holy Jesus, whom I love above all things: and if I perish, I know I have deserved it; but thou wilt not reject him that loves thee: But if I recover, I will live by thy grace and help to do the work of God, and pas|sionately pursue my interest of Heaven, and serve thee in the labour of love, with the cha|rities of a holy zeal, and the diligence of a firm and humble obedience; Lord I will dwell in thy temple, and in thy service, reli|gion shall be my imployment, and alms shall be my recreation, and patience shall be my rest, and to do thy will shall be my meat and drink, and to live shall be Christ, and then to die shall be gain.</P>
<P>O spare me a little that I may recover my strength before I go hence and be no more seen. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Amen.</P>

<P>But besides this, our blessed Lord and his Apostles have added divers other precepts; some of which have been with some violence reduc'd to the Decalogue, and others have not bin noted at all in the catalogues of confession, I shall therefore describe them entirely, that the sick man discover his failings, that by the mercies of God in Jesus Christ, and by the instrument of repentance he may be pre|sented pure and spotlesse before the throne of God.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. IX. Of the sick mans practise of charity and justice, by way of rule.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>LEt the sick man set his house in order be|fore he die</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Magnifi|ca verba mors pro|pe admo|ta excutit</NOTE> state his cases of consci|ence, reconcile the fractures of his family, re|unite brethren, cause right understandings, and remove jealousies; give good counsels for the future conduct of their persons, and estates, charm them into religion by the au|thority and advantages of a dying person:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nam ve|rae voces tum de|mum pe|ctore ab imo e ici|u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tur&mdash; <HI>Lucret.</HI></NOTE> because the last words of a dying man are like the tooth of a wounded Lion, making a deep|er impression in the agony, then in the most vigorous strength.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let the sick man discover every secret of art, or profit, physick, or advantage to mankinde, if he may do it without the preju|dice of a third person. Some persons are so uncharitably envious that they are willing that a secret receipt should die with them, and be buried in their grave; like treasure in the se|pulchre of <HI>David.</HI> But this which is a designe of charity must therefore not be done to any mans prejudice; and the Mason of <HI>Herodotus</HI> the King of Aegypt who kept secret his notice of the Kings treasure, and when he was a dy|ing
<PB N="232" REF="145">
told his son, betrayed his trust then when he should have kept it most sacredly for his own interest. In all other cases let thy chari|ty out-live thee, that thou mayest rejoyce in the mansion of rest, because by thy means ma|ny living persons are eased or advantaged.</P>
<P N="3">3. Let him make his will with great justice and piety, that is, that the right heirs be not defrauded for collaterall respects, fancies or indirect fondnesses; but the inheritances de|scend in their legall and due channell; and in those things where we have a liberty, that we take the opportunity of doing vertuously, that is, of considering how God may be best served by our donatives, or how the interest of any vertue may be promoted; in which we are principally to regard the necessities of our neerest kinred, and relatives, servants and friends.</P>

<P N="5">5. It is proper for the estate of sicknesse, and an excellent anealing us to buriall, that we give alms in this state, so burying treasure in our graves, that will not perish but rise again in the resurrection of the just. Let the

<PB N="234" REF="146">
To this purpose wise and pious was the coun|sell of <HI>Salvian</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Contra avaritiam</NOTE>
<Q>Let a dying man who hath nothing else of which he may make an ef|fective oblation, offer up to God of his sub|stance; Let him offer it with compunction and tears, with grief and mourning, as know|ing that all our oblations have their value, not by the price, but by the affection: and it is our faith that commends the money, since God receives the money by the hands of the poor, but at the same time gives, and does not take the blessing; because he re|ceives nothing but his own, and man gives that which is none of his own, that, of which onely he is a steward, and shall be account|able for every shilling. Let it therefore be offered humbly as a Creditor payes his debts, not magnifically as a Prince gives a donative; and let him remember that such doles do not pay for the sin, but they ease the punishment; they are not proper instruments of redem|ption, but instances of supplication, and ad|vantages of prayer; and when we have done well remember that we have not payed our debt, but showen our willingnesse to give a little of the vast sum we owe: and he that gives plentifully according to the measure of his estate, is still behind hand according to the measure of his sins; let him pray to God that this late oblation may be accepted, and so it will, if it sails to him in a sea of poeni|tentiall tears or sorrows, that it is <HI>so little,</HI> and that it is <HI>so late.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="6">6. Let the sick mans charity be so order|ed that it may not come onely to deck the funerall and make up the pomp; charity wait|ing like one of the solemn mourners; but let it
<PB N="235" REF="146">
be continued, that beside the alms of health and sicknesse, there may be a rejoycing in God for his charity, long after his funeralls, so as to become more beneficial and lesse pub|like; that the poor may pray in private and give God thanks many dayes together. This is matter of prudence: and yet in this, we are to observe the same regards which we had in the charity and alms of our lives; with this onely difference, that in the funerall alms al|so of rich and able persons, the publike cu|stomes of the Church are to be observed, and decencie and solemnity, and the expectations of the poor, and matter of publike opinion, and the reputation of religion; In all other cases, let thy charity consult with humility and prudence, that it never ministers at all to vanity; but be as full of advantage and useful|nesse as it may.</P>
<P N="7">7. Every man will forgive a dying person,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> and therefore let the sick man be ready and sure if he can, to send to such persons whom he hath injured, and beg their pardon and do them right; For in his case, he cannot stay for an opportunity of convenient and advan|tageous reconcilement; he cannot then spin out a treaty, nor beat down the price of com|position, nor lay a snare to be quit from the obligation and co&euml;rcion of lawes; but he must ask forgivenesse down-right, and make him amends as he can, being greedy of ma|king use of this opportunity of doing a du|ty, that must be done, but cannot any more, if not now, untill times return again, and tels the minuts backward, so that yesterday shall be reckoned in the portions of the fu|ture.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="236" REF="147">8. In the intervalls of sharper pains, when the sick man am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sses together all the argu|ments of comfort and testimonies of Gods love to him, and care of him, he must needs find infinite matter of thanksgiving, and glo|rification of God: and it is a proper act of charity and love to God, and justice too, that he do honour to God on his death-bed for all the blessings of his life, not onely in generall communications, but those by which he hath been separate and discerned from others, or supported and blessed in his own person: Such as are; [<HI>In all my life time I never broke a bone, I never fell into the hands of rob|bers; never into publike shame, or into noysome diseases: I have not begd my bread, nor been tempted by great and unequall fortunes: God gave me a good understanding, good friends, or deli|vered me in such a danger, and heard my prayers in such particular pressures of my spirit.</HI>] This or the like enumeration and consequent acts of thanksgiving are apt to produce love to God, and confidence in the day of triall; for he that * gave me blessings in proportion to the state and capacities of my life, I hope also will do so in proportion to the needs of my sicknesse, and my death-bed. This we find practised as a most reasonable piece of piety by the wisest of the Heathens. So <HI>Antipater Tarsensis</HI> gave God thanks for his prosperous voyage into Greece; and <HI>Cyrus</HI> made a hand|som prayer upon the tops of the mountains, when by a phantasme he was warned of his ap|proaching death. <HI>Receive [O God] my Father these holy rites by which I put an end to many and great affairs: and I give thee thanks for thy celestiall signes and prophetic notices, whereby
<PB N="237" REF="147">
thou hast signified to me what I ought to do and what I ought not: I present also very great thanks that I have perceived and acknowledged your care of me, and have never exalted my self above my con|dition for any prosperous accident. And I pray that you will grant felicity to my wife, my children, and friends, and to me a death, such as my life hath been.</HI> But that of <HI>Philagrius</HI> in <HI>Gregory Nazianzen</HI> is eucharisticall, but it relates more especially to the blessings and advantages which are accidentally consequent to sicknesse. <HI>I thank thee O Father and maker of all thy chil|dren, that thou art pleased to blesse and to sanctifie us even against our wils, and by the outward man purgest the inward, and leadest us through crosse wayes to a blessed ending, for reasons best known unto thee.</HI>] However when we go from our hospitall and place of little intermediall rest in our journey to heaven, it is fit that we give thanks to the <HI>major domo</HI> for our entertain|ment. When these parts of religion are finish|ed, according to each mans necessity, there is nothing remaining of personall duty to be done alone, but that the sick man act over these vertues, by the renewings of devotion, and in the way of prayer; and that is to be continued as long as <HI>life,</HI> and <HI>voice,</HI> and <HI>rea|son</HI> dwell with us.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of visitation of the sick: <HI>or</HI> the assistance that is to be done to dying persons, by the mini|stery of their Clergy Guides.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<P>GOd who hath made no new Cove|nant with dying persons distinct from the Covenant of the living, hath also appointed no distinct Sa|craments for them, no other man|ner of usages, but such as are common to all the spirituall necessities of living and health|full
<PB N="243" REF="150">
persons. In all the dayes of our religion, from our baptisme to the resignation and deli|very of our soul, God hath appointed his ser|vants to minister to the necessities, and eter|nally to blesse, and prudently to guide, and wisely to judge concerning souls; and the Ho|ly Ghost that <HI>anointing from above,</HI> descends upon us in severall effluxes, but ever by the ministeries of the Church. <HI>Our heads</HI> are an|ointed with that sacred unction Baptisme (not in ceremony, but in reall and proper effect) <HI>our foreheads</HI> in confirmation, <HI>our hands</HI> in or|dinations; <HI>all our senses</HI> in the visitation of the sick, and all by the ministery of especially de|puted and instructed persons; and we who all our life time derive blessings from the fount|ains of grace, by the channels of Ecclesiastical ministeries, must do it then especially, when our needs are most pungent and actuall. 1. We cannot give up our names to Christ, but the Holy man that ministers in religion must en|roll them and present the persons, and con|signe the grace: when we beg for Gods Spirit, the Minister can best present our prayers, and by his advocation hallow our private desires, and turn them into publike and potent offices. 2. If we desire to be established and confirm|ed in the grace and religion of our Baptisme, the Holy man, whose hands were anointed by a speciall ordination to that and its symbolical purposes, layes his hands upon the Catechu|men and <HI>the anointing from above</HI> descends by that ministery. 3. If we would eat the body and drink the blood of our Lord, we must ad|dresse our selves to the Lords Table, and he that stands there to blesse and to minister, can reach it forth, and feed thy soul; and without
<PB N="244" REF="151">
his ministery thou canst not be nourished with that heavenly feast, nor thy body consigned to immortality, nor thy soul refreshed with the Sacramentall bread from heaven, except by spirituall suppletories, in cases of necessi|ty and an impossible communion. 4. If we have committed sins, the spirituall man is ap|pointed to restore us, and to pray for us, and to receive our confessions, and to enquire into our wounds, and to infuse oil and remedy, and to pronounce pardon. 5. If we be cut off from the communion of the faithfull by our own demerits, their holy hands must re|concile us, and give us peace; they are our appointed comforters, our instructers, our or|dinary Judges; <HI>and in the whole:</HI> what the children of Israel beg'd of <HI>Moses,</HI> that <HI>God would no more speak to them alone,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 20.19.</NOTE> <HI>but by his ser|vant Moses,</HI> lest they should be consumed, God in compliance with our infirmities hath of his own goodnesse established as a perpe|tuall law in all ages of Christianity; that God will speak to us by his <HI>Ministers,</HI> and our so|lemn prayers shall be made to him by <HI>their</HI> advocation, and his blessings descend from heaven by <HI>their</HI> hands, and our offices return thither by <HI>their</HI> presidencies, and our repent|ance shall be managed by <HI>them,</HI> and our par|don in many degrees ministred by <HI>them</HI>; God comforts us by their Sermons, and reproves us by their Discipline, and cuts off some by their severity, and reconciles others by their gen|tlenesse, and relieves us by their prayers, and instructs us by their discourses, and heals our sicknesses by their intercession, presented to God and united to Christs advocation; and in all this, <HI>they are no causes,</HI> but <HI>servants of the
<PB N="245" REF="151">
will of God,</HI> instruments of the Divine Grace and order, <HI>stewards and dispensers</HI> of the myste|ries, and appointed to our souls to serve and lead, and to help in all accidents, dangers, and necessities.</P>
<P>And they who received us in our baptisme, are also to cary us to our grave, and to take care that our end be as our life was, or should have been; and therefore, it is established as an Apostoli|cal rule;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign"><HI>Xe|noph.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">. <HI>lib.</HI> 8.</NOTE> <HI>Is any man sick a|mong you, let him send for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray over him, &amp;c.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jam. 5.14.</NOTE> The sum of the duties and offices respe|ctively implied in these words is in the follow|ing rules.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II. Rules for the manner of visitations of sick persons.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. LEt the Minister of religion be sent to, not onely against the agony of death, but be advised with in the whole con|duct of the sicknesse; for in sicknesse indefi|nitely, and therefore <HI>in every sicknesse,</HI> and therefore in such which are not mortall, which end in health, which have no agony, or finall temptations, S. <HI>Iames</HI> gives the advise: and the sick man being bound to require them, is also tied to do it, when he can know them, and his own necessity. It is a very great evil both in the matter of prudence and piety, that they fear the Priest as they fear the Em|balmer; or the Sextons spade; and love not to converse with him, unlesse he can converse
<PB N="246" REF="152">
with no man else; and think his office so much to relate to the other world, that he is not to be treated with, while we hope to live in this; and indeed that our religion be taken care of, onely when we die; and the event is this, (of which I have seen some sad experi|ence) that the man is deadly sick, and his reason is uselesse, and he is laid to sleep, and his life is in the confines of the grave, so that he can do nothing towards the trimming of his lamp; and the Curate shall say a few pray|ers by him, and talk to a dead man, and the man is not in a condition to be helped; but in a condition to need it hugely. He cannot be called upon to confesse his sins; and he is not able to remember them, and he cannot understand an advice, nor hear a free discourse, nor be altered from a passion, nor cured of his fear, nor comforted upon any grounds of reason or religion, and no man can tell what is likely to be his fate; or if he does, he cannot prophecie good things concerning him, but evil; Let the spiritual man come when the sick man can be conversed withall, and instructed; when he can take medicine and amend; when he understands, or can be taught to understand the case of his soul, and the rules of his conscience; and then his ad|vice may turn into advantage; It cannot o|therwise be useful.</P>
<P N="2">2. The entercourses of the Minister with the sick man have so much variety in them, that they are not to be transacted at once: and therefore they do not well that send once to see the good man with sorrow, and hear him pray, and thank him and dismisse him civilly, and desire to see his face no more; To dresse a

This article was well provided for among the Easterlings; for the Priests in their visitations of a sick per|son did abide in their attendance and mini|stery for seven dayes together. The want of this makes the visitations fruitlesse and the calling of the Clergy contemptible, while it is not suffered to imprint its proper effects upon them that need it in a lasting mini|stery.</P>

In cities they might do so,
<PB N="248" REF="153">
while the Christians were few and the Priests many. But when they that dwelt in the <HI>Pagi</HI> or villages ceased to be Pagans, and were baptized, it grew to be an impossible felicity, unlesse in few cases, and to some more emi|nent persons: but because they need it most, God hath taken care that they may best have it; and they that can, are not very prudent, if they neglect it.</P>
<P N="4">4. Whether they be many or few that are sent to the sick person, let the Curate of his Parish or his own Confessor be amongst them that is, let him not be wholly advised by strangers who know not his particular necessi|ties; but he that is the ordinary Judge, can|not safely be passed by in his extraordinary necessity, which in so great portions depends upon his whole life past; and it is a matter of suspicion when we decline his judgement that knowes us best, and with whom we for|merly did converse, either by choice or by law, by private election or publike constitution. It concerns us then to make severe and pro|fitable judgements, and not to conspire against our selves, or procure such assistances which may handle us softly, or comply with our weak|nesses more then relieve our necessities.</P>
<P N="5">5. When the Ministers of religion are come; first let them do their ordinary offices, that is, pray for grace to the sick man, for pa|tience, for resignation, for health (if it seems good to God in order to his great ends.) For that is one of the ends of the advice of the Apostle; and therefore the minister is to be sent for, not while the case is desperate, but before the sicknesse is come to its <HI>crisis</HI> or pe|riod.) Let him discourse concerning the causes
<PB N="249" REF="153">
of sicknesse, and by a general instrument move him to consider concerning his condition. Let him call upon him to set his soul in order, to trim his lamp, to dresse his soul, to renew acts of grace by way of prayer, to make amends in all the evils he hath done, and to supply all the defects of duty, as much as his past con|dition requires, and his present can admit.</P>
<P N="6">6. According as the condition of the sickness, or the weaknesse of the man is observed, so the exhortation is to be less and the prayers more, because the life of the man was his main pre|paratory, and therefore if his condition be full of pain and infirmity, the shortnesse and small number of his own acts is to be supplied by the act of the Ministers and standers by; who are in such cases to speak more to God for him, then to talk to him. For the prayer of the righteous when it is servent hath a promise to prevail much in behalf of the sick person.<NOTE PLACE="marg">James 5.16.</NOTE> But exhortations must prevail with their own pro|per weight, not by the passion of the Speaker. But yet this assistance by way of prayers is not to be done by long offices, but by <HI>frequent.</HI> and <HI>fervent,</HI> and <HI>holy:</HI> in which offices, if the sick man joyns, let them be short and apt to comply with his little strength, and great in|firmities; if they be said in his behalf with|out his conjunction, they that pray may pru|dently use their own liberty, and take no mea|sures, but their own devotions and opportu|nities and the sick mans necessities.</P>

then there will be no place for the righteous and the sinner to appear in, but places of hor|ror and amazement. * That confidence hath destroyed many souls, and many have had a sad portion who have reckoned themselves in the Calendar of Saints. * That the promi|ses of heaven are so great, that it is not rea|sonable to think that every man, and every life, and an easie religion shall possesse such infinite glories. * That although heaven is a gift, yet there is a great severity and strict exacting of the conditions on our part to re|ceive that gift. * That some persons who have lived strictly for 40. years together, yet have miscarried by some one crime at last, or some secret hypocrisie, or a latent pride, or a cree|ping ambition, or a phantastic spirit; and therefore much lesse can they hope to receive so great portions of felicities, when their life hath been a continuall declination from those severities which might have created confi|dence of pardon and acceptation, through the mercies of God and the merits of Jesus. * That every good man ought to be suspici|ous of himself, and in his judgement con|cerning his own condition to fear the worst, that he may provide for the better. * That we are commanded to work out our salvati|on with fear &amp; trembling. * That this precept was given with very great reason, considering the thousand thousand wayes of miscarrying. * That S. <HI>Paul</HI> himself,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Apud Su|rium. die 27.

that all our industry, and all the violences we can suffer in the prosecution of it are not con|siderable. * That this affair is to be done but once, and then never any more unto eternal ages. * That they who professe themselves servants of the institution and servants of the law and discipline of Jesus will find, that they must <HI>judge</HI> themselves by the proportions of that law by which they were to <HI>rule</HI> them|selves. * That the laws of society and civility, and the voices of my company are as ill <HI>judges</HI> as they are <HI>guides</HI>; but we are to stand or fall by his sentence, who will not consider or value the talk of idle men, or the persuasion of wil|fully abused consciences; but of him, who hath felt our infirmity in all things, <HI>but sin,</HI> and knowes where our failings are unavoidable, and where and in what degree they are ex|cusable; but never will endure a sin should seize upon any part of our love, and delibe|rate choice, or carelesse cohabitation. * That <HI>if our conscience accuse us not,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 John 3.20.</NOTE> <HI>yet are we not here|by justified, for God is greater then our consciences.</HI> * That they who are most innocent have their consciences most tender and sensible.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 4.4.</NOTE> * That scrupulous persons are alwayes most religious, and that to feel nothing, is not a signe <HI>of life</HI> but <HI>of death.</HI> * That nothing can be hid from the eyes of the Lord, to whom the day and the night, publike and private, words and thoughts, actions and designes are equally discernable. * That a lukewarme person is onely se|cured in his own thoughts, but very un|safe in the event, and despised by God. * That we live in an Age in which that which is called and esteemed <HI>a holy life,</HI> in the dayes of the Apostles and holy

<PB N="259" REF="158">
and confessions, and instruments of a|mends or pardon, he either knows not his danger, or cares not for it; and little under|stands how great a horrour that is, that a man should rest his head for ever upon a cradle of flames, and lye in a bed of sorrows, and never sleep, and never end his groans, or the gnash|ing of his teeth.</P>
<P>This is that which some spiritual persons call <HI>a wakening the sinner by the terrours of the law,</HI> which is a good analogie or Tropical ex|pression to represent the threatnings of the Gospel, and the dangers of an incurious and a sinning person: but we have nothing else to do with <HI>the terrours of the law</HI>; for, <HI>Blessed be God,</HI> they concern us not; the terrours of the law were the intermination of curses upon all those that ever broke any of the least Com|mandements; <HI>once,</HI> or <HI>in any instance</HI>: And to it <HI>the righteousnesse of faith</HI> is opposed: <HI>The terrors of the law</HI> admitted no repentance, no pardon, no abatement; and were so severe, that God never inflicted them at all according to the letter, because he admitted all to repentance, that desired it with a timely prayer, unlesse in very few cases, as of <HI>Achan,</HI> or <HI>Corah, the gathe|rer</HI> of sticks upon the Sabbath-day, or the like: but the state of threatnings in the Go|spel is very fearful, because the conditions of avoiding them are easie and ready, and they happen to evil persons after many warnings, second thoughts, frequent invitations to par|don and repentance, and after one entire par|don consigned in Baptism: and in this sense it is necessary that such persons as we now deal withall should be instructed concerning their danger.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="260" REF="159">4. When the sick man is either of himself, or by these considerations set forward with purposes of repentance, and confession of his sins in order to all its holy purposes, and ef|fects, then the Minister is to assist him in the understanding the number of his sins, that is, the several kinds of them, and the various man|ners of prevaricating the divine command|ments; for as for the number of the parti|culars in every kinde, he will need lesse help; and if he did, he can have it no where but in his own conscience, and from the witnesses of his conversation: Let this be done by prudent insinuation, by arts of remembrance, and secret notices, and propounding occasions and instru|ments of recalling such things to his minde, which either by publike fame he is accused of, or by the temptations of his condition it is likely he might have contracted.</P>
<P N="5">5. If the person be truly penitent and for|ward to confesse all that are set before him or offered to his sight at a half face, then he may be complyed withall in all his inno|cent circumstances, and his conscience made placid and willing, and he be drawn forward by good nature and civilitie, that his repen|tance in all the parts of it, and in every step of its progresse and emanation, may be as voluntary and chosen as it can. For by that means if the sick person can be invited to do the work of religion, it enters by the door of his will and choice, and will passe on to|ward consummation, by the instrument of delight.</P>
<P N="6">6. If the sick man be backward and with|out apprehension of the good natur'd and civil way; let the Minister take care that
<PB N="261" REF="159">
by some way or other the work of God be se|cured; and if he will not understand, when he is secretly prompted, he must be hollowed to, and asked in plain interrogatives concern|ing the crime of his life. He must be told of the evil things that are spoken of him in mar|kets and exchanges, the proper temptations and accustomed evils of his calling and con|dition, of the actions of scandal, and in all those actions which were publike, or of which any notice is come abroad, let care be taken that the right side of the case of conscience be turned toward him; and the errour truly represented to him, by which he was abused; as the injustice of his contracts, his oppressive bargains, his rapine &amp; violence; and if he hath perswaded himself to think well of a scanda|lous action, let him be instructed and adver|tised of his folly and his danger.</P>
<P N="7">7. And this advice concerns the Minister of religion to follow without partialitie or fear, or interest: in much simplicity and prudence, and hearty sincerity; having no other consideration, but that the interest of the mans soul be preserved, and no caution used, but that the matter be represented with just circumstances, and civilities fitted to the person with prefaces of honour and regard; but so that nothing of the duty be diminished by it, that the introduction do not spoil the sermon, and both together ruine <HI>two souls</HI> [of <HI>the speaker</HI> and <HI>the hearer.</HI>] For it may soon be considered; if the sick man be a poor or an in|different person in secular account, yet his soul is equally dear to God, and was redeemed with the same highest price, and therfore to be highly regarded: and there is no temptation,
<PB N="262" REF="160">
but that the spirituall man may speak freely without the allayes of interest, or fear, or mi|staken civilities; but if the sick man be a Prince, or a person of eminence or wealth, let it be remembred it is an ill expression of reverence to his authority; or of regard to his person, to let him perish for the want of an honest, and just, and a free homily.</P>
<P>Let the sick man in the scrutiny of his conscience and confession of his sins, be care|fully reminded to consider those sins which are onely condemned <HI>in the court of conscience,</HI> and no where else. For there are certain se|crecies and retirments, places of darknesse, and artificiall veils, with which the Devil uses to hide our sins from us, and to incorporate them into our affections by a constant unin|terrupted practise, before they be prejudiced <MILESTONE N="1"> or discovered. 1. There are many sins which have reputation and are accounted ho|nour, as <HI>fighting a duel, answering a blow with a blow, carrying armies into a neighbour countrey, robbing with a navy, violently seizing upon a king|dom.</HI> <MILESTONE N="2"> 2. Others are permitted by law; as <HI>Vsury</HI> in all countreys; and because every excesse of it is a certain sin, the permission of so suspected a matter makes it ready for us, <MILESTONE N="3"> and instructs the temptation. 3. Some things are not forbidden by lawes, as <HI>lying</HI> in ordi|nary discourse, <HI>jeering, scoffing, intemperate eating, ingratitude, selling too dear, circumvent|ing another in contracts, importunate intreaties,</HI> and <HI>temptation of persons to many instances of sin, pride,</HI> <MILESTONE N="4"> and <HI>ambition.</HI> 4. Some others do not reckon the sin against God, if the lawes have seized upon the person; and many that are impriso|ned for debt, think themselves disobliged

from payment; and when they pay the penal|ty, think they owe nothing for the scandal and disobedience. 5. Some sins are thought not <MILESTONE N="5"> considerable, but go under the title of sins of infirmity, or inseparable accidents of morta|lity; such as <HI>idle thoughts, foolish talking, looser revellings, impatience, anger,</HI> and all the events of evil company. 6. Lastly, many things <MILESTONE N="6"> are thought to be no sins; such as mispending of their time, whole dayes or moneths of use|lesse and impertinent imployment, long ga|ming, winning mens money in greater porti|ons, censuring mens actions, curiosity, aecqui|vocating in the prices and secrets of buying and selling, rudenesse, speaking truths envi|ously, doing good to evil purposes, and the like: Under the dark shadow of these unhap|py, and fruitlesse Yew-trees, the enemy of mankind makes very many to lie hid from themselves, sewing before their nakednesse the fig-leaves of popular and <HI>idol reputation,</HI> and <HI>impunity, publike permission, a temporall pe|nalty, infirmity, prejudice,</HI> and <HI>direct errour in judgement,</HI> and <HI>ignorance.</HI> Now in all these cases the Ministers are to be inquisitive and observant, lest the fallacy prevail upon the penitent to evil purposes of death or diminu|tion of his good; and that those things which in his life passed without observation, may now be brought forth and <HI>passe under sawes and barrows,</HI> that is, the severity and censure of sorrow and condemnation.</P>
<P N="9">9. To which I adde for the likenesse of the thing, that the <HI>matter of omission</HI> be consi|dered; for in them lies the bigger half of our failings; and yet in many instances they are undiscerned, because they very often <HI>sit down
<PB N="264" REF="161">
by</HI> the conscience, but <HI>never upon it</HI>; and they are usually looked upon as poor men do up|on their not having coach and horses, or as that knowledge is missed by <HI>boyes,</HI> and <HI>hindes</HI> which they never had; it will be hard to make them understand their ignorance; it re|quires knowledge to perceive it; and there|fore he that can perceive it, hath it not. But by this pressing the conscience with omissions, I do not mean, recessions or distances, from states of eminency or perfection; for although they may be used by the Ministers as an in|strument of humility, and a chastiser of too big a confidence, yet that which is to be con|fessed and repented of, is omission of duty in direct instances and matters of commande|ment, or collaterall, and personall obligati|ons, and is especially to be considered by Kings and Prelates, by Governours and rich persons, by Guides of souls, and Presidents of learning in publike charge; and by all o|thers in their proportions.</P>
<P N="10">10. The ministers of religion must take care that the sick mans confession be as minute and particular as it can: and that as few sins as may be, be entrusted to the generall prayer of pardon for all sins: for by being particular and enumerative of the variety of evils which have disordered his life, his repentance is dis|posed to be more pungent and afflictive, and therefore more salutary and medicinall; it hath in it more sincerity, and makes a better judgement of the finall condition of the man; and from thence it is certain, the hopes of the sick man can be more confident and rea|sonable.</P>
<P N="11">11. The spirituall man that assists at the
<PB N="265" REF="161">
repentance of the sick must not be inquisitive into all the circumstances of the particular sins, but be content with those that are di|rect parts of the crime, and aggravation of the sorrow; Such as <HI>frequency, long abode,</HI> and <HI>earnest choice</HI> in acting them, <HI>violent desires, great expense, scandall</HI> of others, <HI>dishonour to the religion, dayes of devotion</HI> and <HI>religious so|lemnities, holy places,</HI> and <HI>the degrees of boldnesse</HI> and <HI>impudence, perfect resolution,</HI> and <HI>the habit.</HI> If the sick person be reminded or inquired into concerning these, it may prove a good instrument to increase his contrition, and per|fect his penitentiall sorrows, and facilitate his ablution, and the means of his amendment. But the other circumstances, as of the rela|tive person in the participation of the crime, the measures or circumstances of the impure action, the name of the injured man or wo|man, the quality or accidentall condition; these and all the like are but questions spring|ing from curiosity, and producing scruple, and apt to turn into many inconveniencies.</P>
<P N="11">11. The Minister in this duty of repent|ance must be diligent to observe concerning the person that repents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> si deposi|tum non insiciatur amicus si reddat ve|teremou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> tota aeru|gine sol|lem, Pro|digiosa si les &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">huscis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> li|belli.</NOTE> that he be not im|posed upon by some one excellent thing that was remarkable in the sick mans former life.

<PB N="266" REF="162">
blessings, but it is very sad that the reward should be all spent in this world: some are rarely just persons, and punctuall observers of their word with men, but break their pro|mises with God, and make no scruple of that. In these and all the like cases, the spirituall man must be carefull to remark, that <HI>good proceeds from an intire and integrall cause, and evil from every part</HI>: That one sicknesse can make a man die; but he cannot live and be called a sound man, without an intire health; and therefore if any confidence arises upon that stock, so as that it hinder the strictness of the repentance, it must be allayed with the repre|sentment of this sad truth; <HI>That he who reserves one evil in his choice, hath chosen an evil porti|on,</HI> and <HI>colliquintida and death is in the pot:</HI> and he that worships the God of Israel with a fre|quent sacrifice, and yet upon the anniversary will <HI>bow in the house of Venus,</HI> and loves to see the follies and the nakednesse of <HI>Rimmon,</HI> may eat part of the flesh of the sacrifice, and fill his belly, but shall not be refreshed by the holy cloud arising from the altar, or the dew of heaven descending upon the mysteries.</P>
<P N="12">12. And yet the Minister is to estimate, that one (or more good things) is to be an ingredient into his <HI>judgement, concerning the state of his soul,</HI> and the capacities of his re|stitution, and admission to the peace of the Church; and according as the excellency and usefulnesse of the grace hath been, and accor|ding to the degrees and the reasons of its pro|secution, so abatements are to be made in the injunctions and impositions upon the peni|tent. For every vertue is one degree of ap|proach to God; and though in respect of the
<PB N="267" REF="162">
acceptation, it is equally none at all, that is, it is as certain a death if a man dies with one mortall wound, as if he had twenty, yet in such persons who have some one or more ex|cellencies, though not an intire piety, there is naturally a neerer approach to the estate of grace, then in persons who have done evils and are eminent for nothing that is good. But in making judgement of such persons, it is to be inquired into and noted accordingly, why the sick person was so eminent in that one good thing; whether <HI>by choice</HI> and apprehen|sion of his duty, or whether it was a vertue from which <HI>his state of life ministred nothing to dehort or discourage him,</HI> or whether it was onely <HI>a consequent of his naturall temper and constitution.</HI> If <HI>the first,</HI> then it supposes him in the neighbourhood of the state of grace, and that in other things he was strongly tem|pted. <HI>The second</HI> is a felicity of his education, and an effect of providence. <HI>The third</HI> is a felicity of his nature and a gift of God in or|der to spirituall purposes. But yet of every one of these, advantage is to be made. If he conscience of his duty was the principle, then he is ready formed to entertain all other gra|ces upon the same reason, and his repentance must be made more sharp and penall; because he is convinced to have done against his con|science in all the other parts of his life; but the judgement concerning his finall state ought to be more gentle, because it was a huge temptation that hindred the man and abused his infirmity: but if either <HI>his calling</HI> or <HI>his nature</HI> were the parents of the grace, he is in the state of <HI>a morall man,</HI> (in the just and proper meaning of the word) and to be
<PB N="268" REF="163">
handled accordingly: that vertue disposed him rarely well to many other good things, but was no part of the grace of sanctifica|tion; and therefore the mans repentance is to begin anew, for all that; and is to be fi|nished in the returns of health, if God grants it, but if he denies it, it is much, very much the worse for all that sweet natur'd vertue.</P>

<P N="3">3. In pursuance of this caution and pro|vision the Church superinduced <HI>times</HI> and <HI>manners of abstention,</HI> and expressions of sorrow, and canonical punishments which they tyed the delinquent people to suffer before they would admit them to the holy Table of the Lord. For the criminal having obliged him|self by his sin, and the Church having declared it when she could take notice of it, he is bound to repent, to make him capable of pardon with God, and to prove that he is pe|nitent, he is to do such actions, which the Church in the vertue and pursuance of re|pentance shall accept as a testimony of it,
<PB N="271" REF="164">
sufficient to inform her; for as she could not binde at all (in this sence) till the crime was publike, though the man had bound himself in secret: so neither can she set him free till the repentance be as publike as the sin; or so as she can note it and approve it: Though the man be free as to God by his internal act, yet as the publication of the sin was acciden|tal to it, and the Church censure consequent to it, so is the publication of repentance and consequent absolution extrinsecal to the par|don, but accidentally and in the present cir|cumstances necessary. This was the same that the Jews did, (though in other instances and expressions) and do to this day to their pre|varica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing people; and the Essenes in their assemblies; and private Colleges of scholars, and publike Universities. For all these being assemblies of voluntary persons, and such as seek for advantage, are bound to make an artificial authority in their superiours, and so to secure order, and government by their own obedience and voluntary subordination, which is not essential and of proper jurisdicti|on in the superiour; and the band of it is not any coe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">citive power, but the denying to communicate such benefits which they seek in that communion and fellowship.</P>
<P N="4">4. These I say were introduced <HI>in the speciall manners and instances</HI> by positive authority, and have not a divine authority <HI>commanding them</HI>; but there is a divine power that verefies them, and makes these separations effectual and formidable: for because they are <HI>decla|rative</HI> and <HI>ministerial</HI> in the spirituall man, and suppose a delinquencie and demerit in the o|ther, and a sin against God, our blessed Savi|our

This is hugely agreeable with the words of our Lord, and certain in reason; for that the minister does nothing to the final altera|tion of the state of the mans soul by way of
<PB N="273" REF="165">
sentence is demonstratively certain, because he cannot binde a man, but such as hath bound himself, and who is bound in heaven by his sin before his sentence in the Church: as also be-because the binding of the Church is meerly accidental, and upon publication only; and when the man repents he is absolved before God, before the sentence of the Church, upon his contrition and dereliction only; and if he were not, the Church could not absolve him: The consequent of which evident truth is this, that whatsoever impositions the Church offi|cers impose upon the criminal, they are to a|void scandal, to testifie repentance, and to exercise it, to instruct the people, to make them fear, to represent the act of God, and the secret and the true state of the sinner; and although they are not essentially necessary to our pardon, yet <HI>they are become necessary when the Church hath seized upon the sinner by publike notice of the crime</HI>; necessary (I say) for the <HI>removing the scandal,</HI> and <HI>giving testimony of our contrition,</HI> and <HI>for the receiving all that comfort which he needs,</HI> and can derive from the promises of pardon, as they are published by him that is commanded to preach them to all them that repent: and therefore although it cannot be necessary as to the obtaining pardon, that the Priest should <HI>in private</HI> absolve a sick man from <HI>his private sins,</HI> and there is <HI>no loosing</HI> where there was <HI>no pre|cedent binding,</HI> and he that was only bound be|fore God, can before him onely be loosed, yet as to confess sins to any Christian in private may have many good ends, and to confess them to a Clergy-man may have many more; so to hear Gods sentence at the mouth of the Mini|sters, <HI>pardon</HI> pronounced by Gods embassador, is of huge comfort to them, that cannot otherwise
<PB N="274" REF="166">
be comforted, and whose infirmity needs it; and therefore it were very fit it were not neg|lected in the dayes of our fear and danger, of our infirmities and sorrow.</P>
<P N="5">5. The execution of this ministery, being an act of prudence and charity, and therefore relative to changing circumstances it hath been and in many cases <HI>may,</HI> and in some <HI>must</HI> be rescinded and altered; the time of separa|tion may be lengthned and shortned, the con|dition made lighter or heavier, and for the same offence the Clergy man is deposed, but yet admitted to the communion, for which one of the people who hath no office to lose, is denyed the benefit of communicating; and this sometimes when he might lawfully re|ceive it; and a private man is <HI>separate</HI> when a multitude or a prince is nor, cannot, ought not; and at last, when the case of sicknesse and danger of death did occur, they admitted all men that desired it; sometimes without scruple or difficulty, sometimes with some little restraint in great or insolent cases (as in the case of Apostacie, in which the Councel of Arls denyed absolution, unlesse they received and gave publike satisfaction by acts of re|pentance;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arelat. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> 3.</NOTE> and some other Councels denyed at any time to do it to such persons) according as seemed sitting to the present necessities of the Church: all which particulars declare it to be no part of a divine commandment, that any man should be denyed to receive the Commu|nion if he desires it, and if he be in any pro|bable capacitie of receiving it.</P>
<P N="6"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vide 2 Cor. 2 10 &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Cy+prian ep. 73.</NOTE>6. Since the separation was an act of li|bertie and a direct negative, it followes that the restitution was a meer doing that which they refused formerly, and to give the holy
<PB N="275" REF="166">
Communion was the formality of absolution, and all the instrument and the whole matter of reconcilement, <HI>the taking off the punishment, is the pardoning of the sin</HI>; for this without the other is but a word; and if this be done I care not whether any thing be said or no. <HI>Vi|num Dominicum ministratoris gratia est</HI>: is also true in this sence: to give the chalice and cup is the grace and indulgence of the Minister; and when that is done the man hath obtained the peace of the Church; and to do that is all the absolution the Church can give; and they were vain disputes which were com|menced some few ages since, concerning <HI>the forms of absolution,</HI> whether they were <HI>indica|tive</HI> or <HI>optative,</HI> by way of <HI>declaration,</HI> or by way of <HI>sentence</HI>; for at first they had no forms at all; but they said a prayer, and after the manner of the Jews laid hands upon the pe|nitent, when they prayed over him, and so admitted him to the holy Communion; for since the Church had no power over her children, but of excommunicating and deny|ing them to attend upon <HI>holy offices</HI> and <HI>mini|steries</HI> respectively, neither could they have any absolution, but to admit them thither from whence formerly they were forbidden; whatsoever ceremonie or forms did signifie, this was superinduced and arbitrary, alter|able and accidental, it had variety, but no necessity.</P>
<P N="7">7. The practise consequent to this is, that if the penitent be bound by the positive censures of the Church, he is to be recon|ciled upon those conditions which the laws of the Church tye him to, in case he can perform them; if he cannot, he can no longer be prejudiced by the censure of the
<PB N="276" REF="167">
Church, which had no relation but to the peo|ple, with whom the dying man is no longer to converse;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Caus. 6. Q. 6 &amp; q. 7.</NOTE> for whatsoever relates to God, is to be transacted in spirituall wayes, by con|trition, and internall graces; and the mercy of the Church is such, as to give him her peace and her blessing upon his undertaking to obey her injunction, if he shall be able; which injunctions if they be declared by pub|like sentence, the Minister hath nothing to do in the affairs but to remind him of his ob|ligation, and reconcile him, that is, give him the Holy Sacrament.</P>
<P N="8">8. If the penitent be not bound by publike sentence, the Minister is to make his repentance as great, and his heart as con|trite as he can; to dispose him by the repe|tition of acts of grace in the way of prayer, and in reall and exteriour instances where he can, and then to give him the Holy Com|munion in all the same cases, in which he ought not to have denied it to him in his health, that is, even in the beginnings of such a repentance, which by humane signes he beleeves to be reall and holy; and after this, the event must be left to God. The reason of the rule depends upon this; Because there is no Divine commandement directly forbidding the Rulers of the Church to give the Communion to any Christian that de|sires it, and professes repentance of his sins. And all Church discipline in every instance, and to every single person was imposed up|on him by men, who did it according to the necessities of this state and constitution of our affairs below; but we who are but Mi|nisters and delegates of pardon and condem|nation,
<PB N="277" REF="167">
must resigne and give up our judge|ment when the man is no more to be judged by the sentences of man, and by the pro|portions of this world, but of the other; to which if our reconciliation does advantage, we ought in charity to send him forth with all the advantages he can receive; for he will need them all: and therefore the Nicene Councel commands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 13. vide eti|am Conc.

They who in the article and danger of death were ad|mitted to the communion, and tied to pe|nance if they recovered (which was ever the custome of the ancient Church, unlesse in very few cases) were but in the threshold of repentance, in the commencement and first introductions to a devout life: and indeed then it is a fit ministery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">O sacrum convivium in quo Christus sumicur, re|colitur memoria passi ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">us, mens impletur gratia &amp; futurae glorie nobis pignus datur.</NOTE> that it be given in all the periods of time in which the par|don of sins is working, since it is the Sacrament of that great mystery, &amp; the exhibition of that blood <HI>which is shed for the remis|sion of sins.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. The Minister of religion ought not to give the Communion to a sick person, if he retains the affection to any sin, and refuses to disavow it, or professe repentance of all sins whatsoever, if he be required to do it. The
<PB N="278" REF="168">
reason is, because it is a certain death to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ita vide ut prosit illis ignosci quos ad poenam ipse Deus de|duxit: quod ad me attinet non sum crudelis, sed vereor no quod remisero patiar.</NOTE> and an increase of his misery if he shall so prophane the body and blood of Christ, as to take it into so un|holy a breast,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tryphaena dixit apud Petro|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ium.</NOTE> where Sathan reignes, and sin is princi|pall, and the Spirit is extinguished; and Christ loves not to enter, because he is not suffered to inhabite.

But whe|ther he be so or no, or if he be, whether that be timely, and effectuall and sufficient toward the pardon of sins before God, is another consideration, of which we may conjecture here, but we shall know it at doomsday. The spirituall man is to do his ministery by the rules of Christ, and as the customs of the Church appoint him; and after the manner of men; the event is in the hands of God, and is to be expected not directly and wholly ac|cording to his ministery; but to the former life, or the timely <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Quaecunque ergo de poeni|tentia jubendo dicta sunt, non ad exteriorem sed ad interio|rem referenda sunt, sine qua nullus unquam Deo reconcili|ari poterit.</NOTE> <HI>internall repentance</HI> and amendment; of which I have already given ac|counts.

<P N="10">10. It is the Ministers office to invite sick and dying persons to the Holy Sacrament; such whose lives were fair, and laudable, and yet their sicknesse sad and violent, making them list-lesse and of slow desires, and flower apprehensions; that such persons who are in the state of grace, may lose no accidentall ad|vantages of spirituall improvement, but may receive into their dying bodies the symboles and great consignations of the resurrection, and into their soules the pledges of immorta|lity; and may appear before God their Father in the union, and with the impresses and like|nesse of their elder Brother. But if the per|sons be of ill report, and have lived wicked|ly, they are not to be invited, because their case is hugely suspicious, though they then re|pent and call for mercy; but if they demand it, they are not to be denied; onely let the Minister in generall represent the evil conse|quents of an unworthy participation; and if the penitent will judge himself unworthy let him stand candidate for pardon at the hands of God, and stand or fall by that unerring and mercifull sentence; to which his severity of condemning himself before men, will make the easier and more hopefull addresse. And the strictest among the Christians, who denied to reconcile lapsed persons after baptisme, yet acknowledged that there were hopes re|served in the court of heaven for them, though not here; since we who are easily deceived by the pretences of a reall return, are tied to dispense Gods graces as he hath given us com|mission, <HI>with fear and trembling,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1.

<P N="11">11. When the holy Sacrament is to be administred, let the exhortation be made proper to the mystery; but fitted to the man; that is, that it be used for the ad|vantages of faith or love, or contrition; let all the circumstances and parts of the Di|vine love be represented; all the mysteri|ous advantages of the blessed Sacrament be declared, * That it is the bread which came from heaven, * That it is the repre|sentation of Christs death to all the purpo|ses and capacities of faith, * and the real exhibition of Christs body and blood to all the puposes of the Spirit, * That it is the earnest of the resurrection, * and the seed of a glorious immortality, * That as by our cognation to the body of the <HI>first Adam</HI> we took in death, so by our union with the body of the <HI>second Adam,</HI> we shall have the inheritance of life; for <HI>as by Adam came death, so by Christ cometh the resurrection of the dead,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 15.22.</NOTE> * That if we being worthy Com|municants of these sacred pledges be pre|sented to God with Christ within us, our being accepted of God is certain even for the sake of his well beloved that dwells within us, * That this is the Sacrament of the body which was broken for our sinnes, of that blood which purifies our souls, by which <HI>we are presented to God pure and holy, in the beloved,</HI> * That now we may ascer|tain

<HEAD>SECT. V. Of Ministring to the sick person by the Spiritual man, as he is the Phy|sitian of souls.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IN all cases of receiving confessions of sick men, and the assisting to the ad|vancement of repentance, the Minister is to apportion to every kinde of sin such spiritual remedies which are apt to mortifie and cure the sin, such as abstinence from their occasions, and opportunities, to avoid temptations, to resist their beginnings, to punish the crime by acts of indignation against the person, fastings and prayer, alms and all the instances of cha|rity, asking forgiveness, restitution of wrongs, satisfaction of injuries, acts of vertue con|trary to the crimes: and although in great and dangerous sicknesses they are not directly to be imposed, unlesse they are direct matters of
<PB N="283" REF="170">
duty, yet where they are medicinall they are to be insinuated, and in general signification remarked to him, and undertaken according|ly: concerning which when he returnes to health he is to receive particular advices; and this advice was inserted into the penitential of England in the time of <HI>Theodore</HI> Arch-Bi|shop of Canterbury,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Caus. 26. q. 7. ab infirmis.</NOTE> and afterward adopted into the Canon of all the Western Churches.</P>
<P N="2">2. The proper temptations of sick men for which a remedie is not yet provided: are <HI>un|reasonable fears,</HI> and <HI>unreasonable confidences,</HI> which the Minister is to cure by the following considerations.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>Considerations against unreasonable fears of not having our sins pardoned.</HEAD>
<P>Many good men, especially such who have tender consciences, impatient of the least sin, to which they are arrived by a long grace and a continual observation of their actions, and the parts of a lasting repentance, many times overact their tendernesse, and turn their cau|tion into scruple, and care of their duty into inquiries after the event, and askings after the counsels of God, and the sentences of dooms|day.</P>
<P>He that asks of the standers by, or of the Minister, whether they think he shall be saved or damned, are to be answered with the words of pity and reproof. Seek not after new light for the searching into the privatest records of God; look as much as you list into the pages of revelation; for they concern your duty;
<PB N="284" REF="171">
but the event is registred in heaven, and we can expect no other certain notices of it, but that it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared by the Father of mercies; we have light enough to tell our duty; and <HI>if we do that</HI> we need not fear what the issue will be; and <HI>if we do not,</HI> let us never look for more light, or inquire after Gods pleasure concerning our souls, since we so little serve his ends in those things where he hath given us light. But yet this I adde, that as pardon of sins in the old Testament was nothing but removing the pu|nishment which then was temporal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. 9.6.</NOTE> and there|fore many times they could tell if their sins were pardoned, and concerning pardon of sins they then had no fears of conscience, but while the punishment was on them, for so long indeed it was unpardoned, and how long it would so remain it was matter of fear, and of present sorrow: Besides this, in the Gospel, pardon of sins is another thing.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 3.26.</NOTE> <HI>Pardon of sins is a sanctification: Christ came to take away our sin by turning every one of us from our iniquities.</HI> And there is not in the nature of the thing any ex|pectation of pardon, or signe or signification of it, but so far as the thing it self discovers it self; As we hate sin and grow in grace, and arrive at the state of holinesse, which is also a state of repentance and imperfection; but yet of sincerity of heart and diligent endea|vour, in the same degree we are to judge con|cerning the forgiveness of sins; for indeed that is the <HI>Evangelical forgivenesse,</HI> and it signifies our pardon, because it effects it, or rather it is in the nature of the thing; so that we are to enquire into no hidden records: forgivenesse of sins is not a secret sentence, a word or a re|cord:
<PB N="285" REF="171">
but it is a state of change and effected upon us; and upon our selves we are to look for it, to read it, and understand it. We are <HI>onely to be curious of our duty,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Est modus gloriandi in consei|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntia ut noveris fidem tuam esse sinceram, spem tuam esse certam.</NOTE> and confident of the Article of remission of sins, and the conclusion of these premises will be, that we shall be full of hopes of a prosperous re|surrection:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>August. Psal.</HI> 149.</NOTE> and our fear and trembling are no instances of our cala|mity, but parts of duty; we shall sure enough be wafted to the shore, although we be tossed with the winds of our sighs, and the unevenness of our fears, and the ebbings and flowings of our passions, if we sail in a right chanel, and steere by a perfect compasse, and look up to God, and call for his help, and do our own endeavour. There are very many reasons why men ought not to despair: and there are not very many men that ever go beyond a hope, till they passe into possession; if our fears have any mixture of hope, that is enough to enable and to excite our duty, and if we have a strong hope, when we cast about, we shall finde reason enough to have many fears: <HI>let not this fear weaken our</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><L>Una est nobilitas, argumen|tumq coloris</L>
<L>Ingenui, timidas non habuisse manus.</L></NOTE> <HI>hands,</HI> and if it allay our gayeties and our confidences, it is no harm. In this uncertainty we must abide, if we have committed sins after baptisme: and those confidences which some men glorie in, are not reall supports or good foundations. The fearing man is the safest, and if he fears on his death-bed, it is but what happens to most considering men, and what was to be looked for
<PB N="286" REF="172">
all his life time, he talked of the terrours of death, and death is the king of terrours: and therefore it is no strange thing if then he be hugely afraid: if he be not it is either a great felicity or a great presumption: but if he wants some degree of comfort or a greater degree of hope, let him be refreshed by con|sidering.</P>
<P N="1"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 1.15.</NOTE>1. <HI>That Christ came into the world to save sinners.</HI> 2 That<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezek. 33.11.</NOTE> <HI>God delights not in the confu|sion and death of sinners.</HI> 3.

That<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 John 2.1.</NOTE> Christ is a perpetual <HI>advocate</HI> daily interceding with his Father for our pardon. 5. That God uses infinite arts, instruments and devices to reconcile us to himself. 6. That<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 5.20.</NOTE> <HI>he prayes us to be in charity with him,</HI> and to be forgiven. 7. That he sends Angels to keep us from vio|lence, and evil company, from temptations and surprizes; and his holy Spirit to guide us in holy wayes, and his servants to warn us and reminde us perpetually; and therefore since certainly he is so desirous to save us, as appears by his word, by his oaths, by his very nature, and his daily artifices of mercy, it is not likely that he will condemn us without great provocations of his Majesty, and per|severance in them. 8. That the covenant of the Gospel is a covenant of grace, and of re|pentance, and being established with so many great solemnities and miracles from heaven, must signifie a huge favour, and a mighty change of things, and therefore that repen|tance which is the great condition of it is a grace that does not expire in little accents and minutes, but hath a great latitude of signifi|cation, and a large extension of parts, under
<PB N="287" REF="172">
the protection of <HI>all which</HI> persons are safe, even when they fear exceedingly. 9. That there are great degrees and differences of glory in heaven; and therefore if we estimate our piety by proportions to the more eminent persons and devouter people, we are not to conclude we shall not enter into the <HI>same state of glory,</HI> but that we shall not go into <HI>the same degrees.</HI> (9) That although forgivenesse of sins is consigned to us in Baptism, and that this Baptism is but once, and cannot be repeated, yet forgivenesse of sins is the grace of the gospel, which is perpetually remanent upon us, and secured unto us so long as we have not renounced our Baptisme; For then we enter into the condition of repentance; and <HI>repentance</HI> is not an indivisible grace, or a thing performed at once; but is working all our lives, and therefore so is our pardon, which ebbes and flowes according as we discompose or renew the decency of our Baptismall pro|mises; and therefore it ought to be certain, that no man despair of pardon, but he that hath voluntarily renounced his Baptism, or willingly estranged himself from that cove|nant: He that sticks to it, and still professes the religion, and approves the faith, and endeavours to obey and to do his duty, this man hath all the veracity of God to assure him, and give him confidence that he is not in an impossible state of salvation, unlesse God cuts him off before he can work, or that he begins to work when he can no longer choose. 10. And then let him consider: the more he fears, the more he hates his sin, that is the cause of it, and the lesse he can be tempted to it, and the more desirous he is of heaven,
<PB N="288" REF="173">
and therefore such fears are good instruments of grace, and good signes of a future pardon. 11. That God in the old law, although he made a Covenant of perfect obedience, and did not promise pardon at all after great sins, yet he did give pardon, and declared it so to them for their own, and for our sakes too: So he did to <HI>David,</HI> to <HI>Manasses,</HI> to the whole Na|tion of the Israelies ten times in the wilder|nesse, even after their Apostacies, and Idola|tries; and in the Prophets,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezek. 18.</NOTE> the mercies of God and his remissions of sins were largely preached;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Joel 2.</NOTE> though in the Law God put on the robes of an angry Judge, and a severe Lord: but therefore in the Gospel, where he hath established the whole summe of affairs upon <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>repentance</HI>; if God should not pardon great sinners that repent after ba|ptisme, with a free dispensation, the Gospel were far harder then the intolerable Covenant of the Law. 12. That if a Proselyte went into the Jewish communion and were circum|cised and baptized, he entred into all the hopes of good things which God had promi|sed, or would give to his people, and yet that was but <HI>the Covenant of works.</HI> If then the Gentile Proselytes by their circumcision and legall baptisme, were admitted to a state of pardon to last so long as they were in the Co|venant, even after their admission; for sins committed against <HI>Moses</HI> law which they then undertook to observe exactly. In the Gospel which is the Covenant of Faith, it must needs be certain, that there is a great grace given, and an easier conditon entred into, then was that of the Jewish law; and that is nothing else, but that abatement is made for our infir|mities,
<PB N="289" REF="173">
and our single evils, and our timely re|pented and forsaken habits of sin, and our violent passions, when they are contested withall, and fought with, and under discipline, and in the beginnings and progresses of mor|tification. 13. That God hath erected in his Church a whole order of men, the main part and dignity of whose work it is to <HI>remit and retain sins</HI> by a perpetuall and daily ministery; and this they do, not onely in baptisme, but in all their offices to be administered after|wards: in the Holy Sacrament of the Eucha|rist which exhibits the Symbols of that blood <HI>which was shed for pardon of our sins,</HI> and therefore by its continued ministery and re|petition declares that <HI>all that while</HI> we are within the ordinary powers and usuall dispen|sations of pardon, even so long as we are in any probable dispositions to receive that Holy Sacrament. And the same effect is also signi|fied and exhibited in the whole power of the Keyes, which if it extends to private sins, sins done in secret, it is certain it does also to pub|like; but this is a greater testimony of the certainty of the remissibility of our greatest sins; for publike sins as they alwayes have a sting and a superadded formality of scandall and ill example, so they are most commonly the greatest; such as murder, sacriledge, and others of unconcealed nature, and unprivate action; and if God for these worst of evils hath appointed an office of ease and pardon, which is and may daily be administred, that will be an uneasie pusillanimity, and fond suspicion of Gods goodnesse to fear, that our repentance shall be rejected, even although we have not committed the greatest, or the
<PB N="290" REF="174">
most of evils. 14. And it was concerning ba|ptized Christians that Saint <HI>Iohn</HI> said, <HI>If any man sin we have an Advocate with the Father, and he is the propitiation for our sins</HI>; and con|cerning lapsed Christians S. <HI>Paul</HI> gave instru|ction, that <HI>if any man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual restore such a man, in the spirit of meeknesse, considering lest ye also be tem|ted:</HI> the Corinthian Christian committed in|cest, and was pardoned; and &verbar; <HI>Simon Magus</HI> af|ter he was baptized offered to commit his own sin of Simony, and yet Saint <HI>Peter</HI> bid him pray for pardon; and S. <HI>Iames</HI> tells, that <HI>if the sick man sends for the Church, and they pray over him, and he confesse his sins they shall be forgiven him.</HI> 15. That onely one sin is de|clared to be irremissible, <HI>the sin against the Ho|ly Ghost, the sin unto death,</HI> as S. <HI>Iohn</HI> calls it, for which <HI>we are not bound to pray,</HI> for all others we are: and certain it is, no man commits a sin against the Holy Ghost, if he be afraid he hath, and desires that he had not; for such penitentiall passions are against the definition of that sin. 16. That all the Sermons in the Scripture written to Christians &amp; Disciples of Jesus, exhorting men to repentance, to be af|flicted, to mourn and to weep, to confession of sins, are sure testimonies of Gods purpose and desire to forgive us, even when we fall after baptisme; and if our fall after baptisme were irrecoverable, then <HI>all preaching were in vain, and our faith were also vain,</HI> and we could not with comfort rehearse the Creed, in which as soon as ever we professe Jesus to have died for our sins, we also are condemned by our own conscience of a sin that shall not be for|given; and then all exhortations, and com|forts,
<PB N="291" REF="174">
and fasts, and disciplines were uselesse, and too late; if they were not given us before we can understand them; for most common|ly as soon as we can we enter into the regi|ons of sin; For we commit <HI>evil actions</HI> be|fore we understand, and together with our understanding they begin to be imputed. 17. That if it could be otherwise, infants were very ill provided for in the Church who were baptized, when they have no stain upon their brows, but the misery they contracted from <HI>Adam</HI>; and they are left to be Angels for ever after, and live innocently in the midst of their ignorances and weaknesse, and tem|ptations, and the heat and follies of youth; or else to perish in an eternall ruine: we can|not think or speak good things of God, if we entertain such evil suspicions of the mercies of the Father of our Lord Jesus. 18. That <HI>the long-sufferance and patience of God</HI> is indeed wonder|full; but therefore it leaves us in certainties of pardon, so long as there is possibilitie to return, if we reduce <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he power to act. 19. That God calls upon us to forgive our brother se|venty times seven times, and yet all that is but like the forgiving a hundred pence for his sake who forgives us ten thousand talents; for so the Lord professed that he had done to him that was his servant and his domestic. 20. That if we can forgive a hundred thou|sand times, it is certain God will do so to us; Our Blessed Lord having commanded us to pray for pardon as we pardon our offending and penitent brother. 21. That even in the case of very great sins, and great judgements inflicted upon the sinners, wise and good men and Presidents of Religion have declared their
<PB N="292" REF="175">
sense to be, that God spent all his anger, and made it expire in that temporall misery; and so it was supposed to have been done in the case of <HI>Ananias</HI>; but that the hopes of any penitent man may not rely upon any uncer|tainty, we find in holy Scripture, that those Christians who had for their scandalous crimes deserved to be given over to Sathan to be buffetted, yet had hopes to be saved in the day of the Lord. 22. That God glories in the titles of mercy and forgivenesse, and will not have his appellatives so finite and limi|ted as to expire in one act, or in a seldome pardon. 23. That mans condition were de|sperate and like that of the falling Angels, equally desperat, but unequally oppressed, considering our infinite weaknesses, and igno|rances, (in respect of their excellent under|standing and perfect choice) if he could be admitted to no repentance after his infant Ba|ptisme: and if he may be admitted to one, there is nothing in the Covenant of the Gospel but he may also to a second, and so for ever as long as he can repent, and return and live to God in a timely religion. 24. That every man is a sinner:<NOTE PLACE="marg">James 3.2.</NOTE> <HI>In many things we offend all,</HI> and <HI>if we say we have no sin we deceive our selves</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Joh. 1.8.</NOTE> and therefore either all must perish, or else there is mercy for all; and so there is, up|on this very stock,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 11.32.</NOTE> because <HI>Christ died for sin|ners, and God hath comprehended all under sin that he might have mercy upon all.</HI> 25. That if ever God sends temporall punishments into the world with purposes of amendment, and if they be not all of them certain consignations to hel; and unlesse every man that breaks his leg, or in punishment loses a child, or wife be cer|tainly
<PB N="293" REF="175">
damned, it is certain that God in these cases is angry and loving, chastises the sin, to amend the person, and smites that he may cure, and judges that he may absolve. 26. That he that <HI>will not quench the smoaking flax, nor break the bruised reed,</HI> will not tie us to per|fection, and the lawes and measures of hea|ven upon earth; and if in every period of our repentance he is pleased with our duty, and the <HI>voyce of our heart,</HI> and <HI>the hand of our de|sires,</HI> he hath told us plainly that he will not onely pardon all the sins of the dayes of our folly, but the returns and surprises of sins in the dayes of repentance, if we give no way, and allow no affection, and give no peace to any thing that is Gods enemy; <HI>all the past sins,</HI> and <HI>al the seldom returning</HI> and <HI>ever repented evils</HI> being put upon the accounts of the Crosse.</P>

<HEAD>An exercise against despair in the day of our death.</HEAD>
<P>TO which may be added this short exer|cise, to be used for the curing the tem|ptation to direct despair, in case that the hope and faith of good men be assaulted in the day of their calamity.</P>
<P>I consider that the ground of my trouble is my sin; and if it were not for that I should not need to be troubled; but the help that all the world looks for, is such as supposes a man to be a sinner. * Indeed if from my self I were to derive my title to heaven, then my sins were a just argument of despair; but now that they bring me to Christ, that they drive me to an appeal to Gods mercies, and to take
<PB N="294" REF="176">
sanctuary in the Crosse, they ought not, they cannot infer a just cause of despair. * I am sure it is a stranger thing that God should take upon him hands and feet, and those hands and feet should be nailed upon a crosse, then that a man should be partaker of the felici|ties of pardon, and life eternall; and it were stranger yet, that God should do so much for man, and that a man that desires it, that la|bours for it, that is in life and possibilities of working his salvation, should inevitably misse that end, for which that God suffered so much. For what is the meaning, and what is the extent, and what are the significations of the Divine mercy, in pardoning sinners? If it be thought a great matter that I am charged with originall sin: I confesse I feel the weight of it in loads of temporall infelicities, and proclivities to sin. But I fear not the guilt of it, since I am baptized; and it cannot do honour to the reputation of Gods mercy, that it should be all spent in remissions of what I never chose, never acted, never knew of, could not help, concerning which I recei|ved no commandement, no prohibition: But (blessed be God) it is ordered in just mea|sures that, that originall evil which I contra|cted <HI>without my will,</HI> should be taken away <HI>without my knowledge</HI>; and what I suffered be|fore I had a being, was cleansed before I had an usefull understanding. But I am taught to beleeve Gods mercies to be <HI>infinite,</HI> not onely <HI>in himself,</HI> but <HI>to us</HI>; for mercy is <HI>a relative terme,</HI> and we are its <HI>correspondent</HI>; of all the creatures which God made, we one|ly in a proper sense are the subjects of mer|cy and remission; Angels have more of <HI>Gods
<PB N="295" REF="176">
bounty</HI> then we have, but <HI>not so much of his mercy</HI>; and beasts have little rayes of his kindnesse, and effects of his wisdom and gra|ciousnesse in petty donatives; but nothing of <HI>mercy</HI>; for they have no lawes, and there|fore no sins, and need no mercy, nor are ca|pable of any: Since therefore man alone is the correlative or proper object and vessell of reception of an infinite mercy, and that mer|cy is in <HI>giving</HI> and <HI>forgiving,</HI> I have reason to hope that he will so forgive me that my sins shall not hinder me of heaven; or because it is a gift, I may also upon the stock of the same infinite mercy hope he will give heaven to me; and if I have it either upon the ti|tle of <HI>giving,</HI> or <HI>forgiving,</HI> it is alike to me, and will alike magnifie the glories of the Di|vine mercy. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 6.23.</NOTE> And because <HI>eternall life is the gift of God,</HI> I have lesse reason to despair; for if my sins were fewer, and my dispropor|tions towards such a glory were lesse, and my evennesse more, yet it is still a gift, and I could not receive it, but as a free, and a gra|cious donative; and so I may still; God can still give it me; and it is not an impossible ex|pectation to wait and look for such a gift at the hands of <HI>the God of mercy</HI>; the best men deserve it not, and I who am the worst, may have it given me. * And I consider, that God hath set no measures of his mer|cy, but that we be within the Covenant, that is, repenting persons, endeavouring to serve him with an honest single heart; and that within this Covenant there is a very great latitude, and variety of persons, and degrees and capacities; and therefore that it cannot stand with the proportions of so infi|nite

a mercy that obedience be exacted to such a point (which he never expressed) un|lesse it should be the least, and that to which all capacities though otherwise unequall are fitted, and sufficiently enabled. * But how|ever <HI>I</HI> finde that the Spirit of God taught the writers of the New Testament to apply to us all in general, and to every single person in particular some gracious words which God in the Old Testament spake to one man upon a special occasion in a single and temporal in|stance: such are the words which God spake to <HI>Ioshuah, I will never fail thee nor forsake thee,</HI> and upon the stock of that promise S. <HI>Paul</HI> forbids covetousnesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hebr. 13.5.</NOTE> and perswades conten|tednesse because those words were spoken by God to <HI>Ioshuah</HI> in another case. If the graci|ous words of God have so great extension of parts, and intension of kinde purposes, then how many comforts have we upon the stock of all the excellent words which are spoken in the Prophets, and in the Psalms? and I will never more question whether they be spo|ken concerning me, having such an authentic precedent so to expound the excellent words of God; all the treasures of God which are in the Psalms are my own riches, and the wealth of my hope; there will I look, and whatsoever I can need, that I will depend up|on: for certainly if we could understand it; that which is infinite (as God is) must needs be some such kinde of thing; it must go whi|ther it was never sent, and signifie what was not first intended, and it must warm with its light, and shine with its heat, and refresh when it strikes, and heal when it wounds, and ascer|tain where it makes afraid, and intend all when
<PB N="297" REF="177">
it warms one, and mean a great deal in a small word; and as the Sun passing to its Southern Tropic looks with an open eye upon his sun|burnt Aethiopians, but at the same time sends light from its posterns and collateral influen|ces from the backside of his beams, and sees the corners of the East, when his face tends towards the West, because he is a round body of fire, and hath some little images and re|semblances of the infinite; so is Gods mercy; when it looked upon <HI>Moses</HI> it relieved S. <HI>Paul,</HI> and it pardoned <HI>David,</HI> and gave hope to <HI>Ma|nasses,</HI> and might have restored <HI>Iudas,</HI> if he would have had hope and used himself accord|ingly. * But as to my own case, I have sinned grievously and frequently. But I have repent|ed it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vixi, p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|cavi, poe|nital, na|turae cessi.</NOTE> but I have begged pardon, I have con|fessed it and forsaken it, I cannot undo what was done, and I perish if God hath appointed no remedie; if there be no remission: but then my religion falls together with my hope; and Gods word fails as well as I: but I be|lieve the article of <HI>forgivenesse of sins</HI>; and if there be any such thing I may do well; for, I have, and do, and will do that which all good men call repentance, that is, I will be hum|bled before God, and mourn for my sin, and for ever ask forgivenesse, and judge my self, and leave it with haste, and mortifie it with di|ligence, and watch against it carefully; and this I can do but in the manner of a man, I can but mourn for my sins, as I apprehend grief in other instances; but I will rather choose to suffer all evils then to do one deliberate act of sin; I know my sins are greater then my sorrow, and too many for my memory, &amp; too insinuating to be prevented by all my care; but I know also
<PB N="298" REF="178">
that God knowes and pities my infirmities; and how far that will extend, I know not, but that it will reach so far as to satisfie my needs, is the matter of my hope. * But this I am sure of, that I have in my great necessity prayed humbly and with great desire, and sometimes I have been heard in kinde, and sometimes have had a bigger mercy instead of it, and I have the <HI>hope of prayers,</HI> and <HI>the hope of my con|fession,</HI> and <HI>the hope of my endeavour,</HI> and <HI>the hope of many promises</HI> and <HI>of Gods essential goodnesse</HI>; and I am sure that God hath heard my prayers and verified his promises in temporall in|stances: for he ever gave me sufficient for my life, and although he promised such supplies and grounded the confidences of them upon our <HI>first seeking the kingdom of heaven and its righteousnesse,</HI> yet he hath verified it to me, who have not sought it as I ought: But therefore I hope he accepted my endeavour, or will give his great gifts and our great expectation even to the weakest endeavour, to the least, so it be a hearty piety. * And sometimes I have had some chearful visitations of Gods Spirit, and my cup hath been crowned with comfort, and the wine that made my heart glad danced in the chalice, and I was glad that God would have me so; and therefore I hope this cloud may passe; for that which was then a real cause of comfort is so still, if I could dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ern it; and I shall discern it when the veil is taken from my eyes,* (and blessed be God) I can still remember that there are <HI>temptations to despair</HI>; and they could not be temptations if they were not apt to perswade; and had seeming proba|bility on their side; and they that despair think they do it with greatest reason; for if
<PB N="299" REF="178">
they were not confident of the reason, but that it were such an argument as might be op|posed or suspected, then they could not de|spair; <HI>despair assents as firmly and strongly as faith it self</HI>; but because it is a temptation, and despair is a horrid sin, therefore it is cer|tain those persons are unreasonably abused, and they have no reason to despair, for all their confidence; and therefore although I have strong reasons to condemn my self, yet I have more reason to condemn my despair, which therefore is unreasonable, because it is a sin, and a dishonour to God, and a ruine to my condition; and verifies it self, if I do not look to it; for as the hypochondriac person that thought himself dead, made his dream true when he starved himself, because dead people eat not: so do despairing sinners lose Gods mercies by refusing to use, and to believe them. * And I hope it is a disease of judge|ment, not an intolerable condition that I am falling to, because I have been told so con|cerning others, who therefore have been affli|cted, because they see not their pardon sealed after the manner of this world; and the affairs of the Spirit are transacted by immaterial no|tices, by propositions and spiritual discourses, by promises which are to be verified here|after; and here we must live in a cloud, in darknesse under a veil, in fear and uncertain|ties, and our very living by faith and hope, is a life of mystery and secresie, the onely part of the manner of that life in which we shall live in the state of separation; and when a distemper of body or an infirmity of minde happens in the instances of such secret and re|served affairs, we may easily mistake the man|ner
<PB N="300" REF="179">
of our notices for the uncertainty of the thing; and therefore it is but reason I should stay, till the state and manner of my abode be changed before I despair; there it can be no sin, nor error, here it may be both; and if it be <HI>that,</HI> it is <HI>also this</HI>; and then a man may perish for being miserable, and be undone for being a fool. In conclusion, my hope is in God, and I will trust him with the event, which I am sure <HI>will be just,</HI> and I hope <HI>full of mercy.</HI> * However, now I will use all the spi|ritual arts of reason and religion to make me more and more <HI>to love God,</HI> that if I miscarry, <HI>Charity also shall fail,</HI> and something that loves God shall perish, and be damned; which if it be impossible then I may do well.</P>
<P>These considerations may be useful to men <HI>of little hearts</HI> and of <HI>great piety</HI>; or if they be persons who have lived without infamy, or be|gun their repentance so late, that it is very imperfect, and yet so early that it was before the arrest of death. But if the man be a viti|ous person and hath persevered in a vitious life till his death-bed, these considerations are not proper. Let him inquire in the words of the first Disciples after Pentecost: <HI>Men and brethren what shall we do to be saved</HI>? and if they can but entertain so much hope as to en|able them to do so much of their dutie as they can for the present, it is all that can be pro|vided for them; an inquirie in their case can have no other purposes of religion or pru|dence: and the Minister must be infinitely careful that he do no not go about to comfort vitious persons with the comforts belonging to Gods elect, lest he prostitute holy things, and make them common, and his sermons de|ceitful,
<PB N="301" REF="179">
and vices be incouraged in others, and the man himself finde that he was deceived, when he descends into his house of sorrow.</P>
<P>But because <HI>very few</HI> men are tempted with too great fears of failing, but <HI>very many</HI> are tempted by confidence and presumption; the Ministers of religion had need be instruct|ed with spiritual armour, to resist this fiery dart of the Devil, when it operates to evil purposes.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VI. Considerations against Presumption.</HEAD>
<P>I Have already enumerated many particulars to provoke a drowzy conscience to a scruti|nie, and to a suspicion of himself, that by see|ing cause to suspect his condition he might more freely accuse himself and attend to the necessities and duties of repentance; but if either before or in his repentance he grow too big in in his spirit, so as either he does some little violence to the modesties of humilitie, or abate his care and zeal of his repentance, <HI>the spiritual man</HI> must allay his frowardnesse by representing to him. 1. That the growths in grace are long, difficult, uncertain, hindred, of many parts and great variety. 2. That an in|fant grace is soon dash'd and discountenanced, often running into an inconvenience and the evils of an imprudent conduct, being zea|lous, and forward, and therefore confident, but alwayes with the least reason, and the greatest danger; like children and young
<PB N="302" REF="180">
fellows whose confidence hath no other rea|son, but that they understand not their dan|ger and their follies. 3. That <HI>he that puts on his armour ought not to boast, as he that puts it off</HI>; and the Apostle chides the Galatians, for <HI>ending in the flesh after they had begun in the spi|rit</HI>: 4. that a man cannot think too meanly of himself, but very easily he may think too high. 5 That a wise man will alwayes in a matter of great concernment think the worst, and a good man will condemn himself with hearty sentence. 6. That humility and mo|desty of <HI>judgement</HI> and of <HI>hope,</HI> are very good instruments to procure a mercie and a fair re|ception at the day of our death; but presum|ption or bold opinions serve no end of God or man; and is alwayes imprudent, ever fatal, and of all things in the world is its own great|est enemy; for the more any man presumes, the greater reason he hath to fear. 7. That a mans heart is infinitely deceitful, unknown to it self, not certain in his own acts, praying one way, and desiring another, wandring and imperfect, loose and various, worshipping God and entertaining sin, following what it hates, and running from what it flatters, loving to be tempted and betrayed, petulant like a wanton girle, running from, that it might invite the fondnesse and enrage the appetite of the fool|ish young man or the evil temptation that fol|lowes it; cold and indifferent one while, and presently zealous and passionate, furious and indiscreet; not understood of it self or any one else, and deceitful beyond all the arts and numbers of observation. 8. That it is certain we have highly sinned against God, but we are not so certain that our repentance
<PB N="303" REF="180">
is reall and effective, integral and sufficient. 9. That it is not revealed to us whether or no the time of our repentance be not past, or if it be not, yet how far God will give us pardon; and upon what condition, or after what sufferings or duties, is still under a cloud. 10. That vertue and vice are often|times so neer neighbours, that we passe in|to each others borders without observation, and think we do justice when we are cruel, or call our selves liberal when we are loose and foolish in expences; and are amorous when we commend our own civilities, and good nature. 11. That we allow to our selves so many little irregularities, that in|sensibly they swell to so great a heap, that from thence we have reason to fear an evil; for an army of frogs and flies may destroy all the hopes of our harvest. 12. That when we do that which is lawful, and do all that we can in those bounds we commonly and easily run out of our proportions. 13. That it is not easie to distinguish the vertues of our nature from the vertues of our choice; and we may expect the reward of <HI>temper|ance,</HI> when it is against our nature to be drunk; or we hope to have the coronet of virgins for our morose disposition, or our abstinence from marriage upon secular ends. 14. That it may be we call every little sigh or the keeping a fish-day the dutie of repentance, or have entertained false prin|ciples in the estimate, and measures of vertues; and contrarie to the Steward in that Gospel, we write down fourscore when we should set downe but fifty. 15. That it is better to trust the goodnesse,
<PB N="304" REF="181">
and justice of God with our accounts then to offer him large bits. 16. That we are commanded by Christ to <HI>sit down in the lowest place,</HI> till the Master of the house bids us sit up higher. 17. That <HI>when we have done all that we can we are unprofitable servants</HI>; and yet no man does all that he can do; and therefore is more to be despised and undervalued. 18. That the self-accusing Pub|lican was justified rather then the thanksgiving and confident Pharisee. 19. That if <HI>Adam</HI> in Paradise, and <HI>David</HI> in his house, and <HI>Solomon</HI> in the Temple, and <HI>Peter</HI> in Christs family, and <HI>Iudas</HI> in the College of Apo|stles, and <HI>Nicholas</HI> among the Deacons, and the Angels in heaven it self did fall so foully and dishonestly, then it is prudent advice that we <HI>be not high minded, but fear,</HI> and when we stand most confidently take heed lest we fall, and yet there is nothing so likely to make us fall as pride and great opinions; which ruined the Angels, which God resists, which all men despise, and which betrayes us into carelesnesse and a wretchlesse, undiscerning and an unwary spirit.</P>
<P N="4">4. Now the main parts of the Ecclesi|astical ministery are done; and that which remains is, that the Minister <HI>pray over him,</HI> and reminde him to do good actions, as he is capable, * to call upon God for pardon, * to put his whole trust in him, * to resigne himself to Gods disposing, * to be patient and even, * to renounce every ill word or thought, or undecent action which the violence of his sicknesse may cause in him, * to beg of God to give him his holy Spirit, to guide him in his
<PB N="305" REF="181">
agony, and * his holy Angels to guard him in his passage.</P>
<P N="5">5. Whatsoever is besides this, concerns the standers by; that they do all their ministeries diligently, and temperately, * that they joyn with much charity and devotion in the prayer of the Minister, * that they make no outcries or exclamations in the departure of the soul, * and that they make no judgement concern|ing the dying person, by his dying quietly or violently, with comfort or without, with great fears or a cheerful confidence, with sense or without, like a lamb or like a lyon, with con|vulsions or semblances of great pain, or like an expiring and a spent candle; for these happen to all men, without rule, without any known reason, but according as God pleases to dispense the grace, or the punishment for reasons onely known to himself; Let us lay our hands upon our mouth, and adore the mysteries of the divine wisdome and providence, and pray to God to give the dying man rest and pardon, and to our selves grace to live well, and the blessing of a holy and a happy death.</P>

<P>O Almighty and eternall God, there is no number of thy dayes or of thy mercies, thou hast sent us into this world to serve thee and to live according to thy lawes; but we by our sins have provoked thee to wrath, and we have planted thorns and sorrows round about our dwellings, and our life is but a span long, and yet very tedious because of the ca|lamities that inclose us in on every side: the dayes of our pilgrimage are few and evil: we have frail and sickly bodies, violent and di|stempered passions, long designes and but a short stay, weak understandings, and strong enemies, abused fancies, perverse wils: O Dear God, look upon us in mercy and pity; let not our weaknesses make us to sin against thee, nor our fear cause us to betray our duty, nor our former follies provoke thy eternall anger, nor the calamities of this world vex us into tediousnesse of spirit and impatience; but let thy Holy Spirit lead us thorow this vally of misery with safety and peace, with holiness and religion, with spirituall comforts and joy in the Holy Ghost, that when we have served thee in our generations, we may be gathered unto our Fathers, having the testimony of a

holy conscience, in the communion of the Catholike Church, in the confidence of a cer|tain faith, and the comforts of a reasonable, religious and holy hope, and perfect charity with thee our God, and all the world; that neither death nor life, nor Angels, nor prin|cipalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height nor depth, nor any other creature may be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

<P>O Holy and most gracious Saviour Jesus, in whose hands the souls of all faithfull people are laid up till the day of recompence, have mercy upon the body and soul of this thy servant, and upon all thy elect people who love the Lord Jesus, and long for his coming. Lord refresh the imperfection of their con|dition with the aids of the Spirit of grace, and comfort, and with the visitation and guard of Angels, and supply to them all their ne|cessities known onely unto thee; let them dwell in peace and feel thy mercies, pitying their infirmities, and the follies of their flesh, and speedily satisfying the desires of their spirits; and when thou shalt bring us all forth in the day of Judgement, O then shew thy self to be our Saviour Jesus, our Advocate, and our Judge. Lord then remember that thou hast for so many ages prayed for the pardon of those sins which thou art then to sentence. Let not the accusations of our consciences, nor the calumnies and aggravation of Devils, nor the effects of thy wrath presse those souls wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch thou lovest, which thou didst redeem,

O Lord have mercy upon us, have mercy upon us, O Lord let thy mercy lighten upon us as our trust is in thee. O Lord in thee have we trusted, let us never be confounded. Let us meet with joy, and for ever dwell with thee, feeling thy pardon, supported with thy graciousnesse, absolved by thy sentence, saved by thy mercy, that we may sing to the glory of thy Name eternall Alle|lujahs.

<P>Grant that our souls may be bound up in the bundle of life, and in the day when thou bindest up thy Jewels, remember thy servants for good and not for evil, that our souls may be numbred amongst the righteous Amen.</P>
<P>Grant unto all sick and dying Christians, mercy and aids from heaven; and receive the souls returning unto thee, whom thou hast redeemed with thy most precious blood. Amen.</P>

<P>O Most gracious Father, Lord of heaven and earth, Judge of the living and the dead, behold thy servants running to thee for pity and mercy in behalf of our selves and this thy servant whom thou hast smitten with thy hasty rod, and a swift Angel; if it be thy will preserve his life, that there may be place for his repentance and restitution; O spare him a little that he may recover his strength, before he go hence and be no more seen: but if thou hast otherwise decreed, let the mira|cles of thy compassion, and thy wonderfull mercy supply to him the want of the usual measures of time, and the periods of repen|tance and the trimming of his lamp: and let the greatnesse of the calamity be accepted by thee as an instrument to procure pardon for those defects and degrees of unreadiness which may have caused this accident upon thy ser|vant. Lord stirre up in him a great and effe|ctual contrition that the greatnesse of the sor|row, and hatred against sin, and the zeal of his love to thee may in a short time do the work of many dayes; and thou who regardest the heart and the measures of the minde more then the delay and the measures of time, let it be thy pleasure to rescue the soul of thy servant from all the evils he hath deserved, and all the evils that he fears, that in the glorifications of eternity and the songs which to eternal ages thy Saints and holy Angels shall sing to the

stock of grief, that they presently admit a com|fort and contrary affection, while a sorrow that is even and temperate goes on to its period with expectation and the distances of a just time. The <HI>Ephesian Woman</HI> that the souldier told of in <HI>Petronius,</HI> was the talk of all the town, and the rarest example of a dear affecti|on to her husband; she descended with the corps into the vault, and there being attended with her maiden resolved to weep to death, or dye with famine, or a distempered sorrow: from which resolution nor his, nor her friends, nor the reverence of the principal citizens, who used the intreaties of their charity and their power, could perswade her. But a soul|dier that watched seven dead bodies hanging upon trees just over against this monument, crept in, and a while stared upon the silent and comely disorders of the sorrow: and ha|ving let the wonder a while breath out at each others eyes, at last he fetched his supper and a bottle of wine with purpose to eat and drink, and still to feed himself with that sad pretti|nesse; His pity and first draught of wine made him bold and curious to try if the maid would drink, who having many hours since felt her resolution faint as her wearied body, took his kindnesse, and the light returned into her eyes and danced like boyes in a festival; and fear|ing lest the pertinaciousnesse of her Mistresse sorrows should cause her evil to revert, or her shame to approach, assayed whether she would endure to hear an argument to perswade her to drink and live. The violent passion had layed all her spirits in wildness and dissolution and the maid found them willing to be ga|thered
<PB N="327" REF="192">
into order, at the arrest of any new object; being weary of the first, of which like leeches they had sucked their fill, till they fell down and burst. The weeping woman took her cordial and was not angry with her maid, and heard the souldier talk, and he was so plea|sed with the change, that he who first lov'd the silence of the sorrow was more in love with the musick of her returning voice, especially which himself had strung and put in tune; and the man began to talk amorously, and the womans weak heart and head was soon possessed with a little wine, and grew gay, and talked, and fell in love, and that very night in the morning of her passion, in the grave of her husband, in the pompes of mourning, and in her funeral garments, married her new and stranger Guest. For so the wilde forragers of <HI>Lybia</HI> being spent with heat, and dissolved by the too fond kisses of the sun, do melt with their common fires, and die with faintnesse, and descend with mo|tions slow and unable to the little brooks that descend from heaven in the wildernesse; and when they drink they return into the vigor of a new life, &amp; contract strange marriages; &amp; the Lioness is courted by a Panther, and she listens to his love, and conceives a monster that all men call unnatural, and the daughter of an e|quivocal passion and of a sudden refreshment: and so also i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was in the Cave at <HI>Ephesus</HI>: for by this time the souldier began to think it was fit he should return to his watch, and observe the dead bodies he had in charge; but when he ascended from his mourning bridal cham|ber, he found that one of the bodies was stolne by the friends of the dead, and that he was
<PB N="328" REF="193">
fallen into an evil condition, because by the laws of <HI>Ephesus</HI> his body was to be fixed in the place of it. The poor man returns to his woman, cryes out bitterly, and in her presence resolves to dye to prevent his death, and <HI>in se|cret to prevent his shame</HI>; but now the womans <HI>love was raging</HI> like her former sadnesse, and grew witty, and she comforted her souldier, and perswaded him to live, lest by losing him who had brought her from death and a more grievous sorrow, she should return to her old solemnities of dying and lose her honour for a dream, or the reputation of her constancy without the change and satisfaction of an en|joyed love. The man would fain have lived if it had been possible, and she found out this way for him, that he should take the body of her first husband whose funeral she had so strangely mourned, and put it upon the gal|lows in the place of the stolne thief; he did so and escaped the present danger to possesse a love which might change as violently as her grief had done: But so have I seen a croud of disordered people rush violently and in heaps till their utmost border was restrained by a wall, or had spent the fury of the first fluctuati|on and watry progress, and by &amp; by it returned to the contrary with the same earnestness, only because it was violent &amp; ungoverned; a raging passion is this croud, which when it is not un|der discipline and the conduct of reason, and the proportions of temperate humanity, runs passionatly the way it happens, and by and by as greedily to another side, being swayed by its own weight, and driven any whither by chance, in all its pursuits having no
<PB N="329" REF="193">
rule, but to do all it can, and spend it self in haste and expire with some shame and much undecency</P>
<P>When thou hast wept a while compose the body to burial; which that it be done gravely, decently and charitably, we have the example of all nations to engage us, and of all ages of the world to warrant: so that it is against <HI>com|mon honesty, and publike fame and reputation</HI> not to do this office.</P>
<P>It is good that the body be kept vailed and secret, and not exposed to curious eyes, or the dishonours wrought by the changes of death discerned and stared upon by imperti|nent persons. When <HI>Cyrus</HI> was dying he called his sons and friends to take their leave, to touch his hand, to see him the last time, and gave in charge, that when he had put his veil over his face, no man should uncover it; and <HI>Epiphanius</HI> his body was rescued from inquisi|tive eyes by a miracle; Let it be in|terred after the manner of the coun|trey and the laws of the place, and the dignity of the person.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> For so <HI>Iacob</HI> was buried with great solemni|tie, and <HI>Iosephs</HI> bones were carried into Canaan after they had been em|balmed and kept four hundred years: and <HI>devout men carried S.

<PB N="330" REF="194">
flowers. But when <HI>Marc. Anthony</HI> gave the body of <HI>Brutus</HI> to his freed man to be buried honestly, he gave also his own mantle to be thrown into his funeral pile: and the magni|ficence of the old funeral we may see largely described by <HI>Virgil</HI> in the obsequies of <HI>Mise|nus,</HI> and by <HI>Homer</HI> in the funeral of <HI>Patroclus.</HI> It was noted for piety in the men of <HI>Iabesh-Gilead</HI> that they shewed kindness to their <HI>Lord Saul</HI> and buried him; and they did it honour|ably. And our blessed Saviour who was tem|perate in his expence, and grave in all the parts of his life and death, as age and sobriety it+self; yet was pleased to admit the cost of <HI>Ma|ries</HI> ointment upon his head and feet, because she did it against his burial; and though she little thought it had bin so nigh, yet because he accepted it for that end, he knew he had made her apologie sufficient:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><L>Nam quid sibi saxa cavata</L>

So far is piety: beyond it may be the ostenta|tion and braging of a grief, or a designe to serve worse ends; such was that of <HI>Herod</HI> when he made too studied and elaborate a funeral for <HI>Aristobulus</HI> whom he had murdered; and of <HI>Regulus</HI> for his boy, at whose pile he killed dogs, nightingales, parrots, and little horses; and such also was the expence of some of the Romans, who hating their left wealth gave order by their Testament to have huge porti|ons

<P>Concerning doing honor to the dead:<NOTE PLACE="marg">I ustravitque <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iros di, it&abque; no|vissima verba. Aeneid.</NOTE> the consideration is not long. Anciently the friends of the dead used to make their funeral Orati|ons and what they spake of greater commendation
<PB N="334" REF="196">
was pardoned upon the accounts of friend|ship; but when Christianity seized upon the possession of the world, this charge was de|volved upon Priests and Bishops, and they first kept the customs of the world, and ador|ned it with the piety of truth and of religion; but they also so ordered it that it should not be cheap: for they made funerall Sermons onely at the death of Princes, or of such ho|ly persons, <HI>who shall judge the Angels</HI>; the custome descended, and in the channels min|gled with the veins of earth thorow which is passed; and now adayes men that die are commended at a price; and the measure of their Legacy is the degree of their vertue; but <HI>these things ought not so to be:</HI> The reward of the greatest vertue ought not to be pro|stitute to the doles of common persons, but preserved like Laurell and Coronets, to re|mark and encourage the noblest things. Per|sons of an ordinary life should neither be praised publikely nor reproached in private: for it is an office and charge of humanity to speak no evil of the dead, (which I suppose is meant concerning things not publike and evident) but then neither should our charity to them teach us to tell a lie, or to make a great flame from a heap of rushes and mushrooms, and make Orations crammed with the narrative of little observances and acts of <HI>civil,</HI> and <HI>necessary,</HI> and <HI>externall religion.</HI></P>
<P>But that which is most con|siderable, is that we should do something for the dead,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><L><GAP DESC="foreign"></L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign"></L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign">.</L>
<BIBL><HI>Il.</HI> &dagger;.</BIBL></NOTE> something that is reall and of proper advantage. That
<PB N="335" REF="196">
we performe their will the lawes oblige us, and will see to it; but that we do all those parts of personall duty which our dead left unperformed, and to which the lawes do not oblige us, is an act of great charity, and per|fect kindnesse: and it may redound to the advantage of our friends also, that their debts be payed even beyond the Inventary of their moveables.</P>
<P>Besides this, let us right their causes, and assert their honour: When <HI>Marcus Regulus</HI> had injured the memory of <HI>Herennius Senecio, Metius Carus</HI> asked him, <HI>What he had to do with his dead?</HI> and became his advocate after death, of whose cause he was Patron when he was alive: And <HI>David</HI> added this also, that he did kindnesse to <HI>Mephibosheth</HI> for <HI>Io|nathans</HI> sake, and <HI>Solomon</HI> pleaded his Fathers cause by the sword against <HI>Ioab</HI> and <HI>Shimei.</HI> And certainly it is the no|blest thing in the world to do an act of kindnesse to him whom we shall never see;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. <HI>Isoc. Plataica.</HI></NOTE> but yet hath deserved it of us, and to whom we would do it if he were pre|sent; and unlesse we do so, our charity is mercenary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">&mdash;miserum in lattore Tenxi flebant &amp; cineri ingrato su|prema ferebant. Eneid. 6.</NOTE> and our friendships are di|rect merchandize, and our gifts are brokage; but what we do to the dead, or to the living for their sakes, is <HI>gratitude</HI> and <HI>vertue for vertues sake,</HI> and <HI>the no|blest portion of humanitie.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="197">And yet I remember that the most excel|lent Prince <HI>Cyrus</HI> in his last exhortation to his sons upon his death bed, charms them into peace and union of hearts and designes, by telling them that his soul would be still alive, and therefore fit to be revered: and accounted as awful and venerable as when he was alive; and what we do to our dead friends is not done to persons undiscerning as a fallen tree, but to such who better attend to their rela|tives, and to greater purposes though in other manner, then they did here below. And therefore those wise persons who in their fu|neral orations made their doubt, with an [<GAP DESC="foreign">, If the dead have any perception of what is done below] which are the words of <HI>Isocrates,</HI> in the funeral <HI>encomium</HI> of <HI>Evagoras,</HI> did it upon the uncertain opinion of the souls im|mortality; but made no question if they were living they did also understand what could concern them. The same words <HI>Nazianzen</HI> uses at the exequies of his sister <HI>Gorgonia,</HI> and in the former invective against <HI>Iulian</HI>; but this was upon another reason; even because it was uncertain what the state of separation was, and whether our dead perceive any thing of us till we shall meet in the day of judge|ment: If it was uncertain then, it is certain, since that time we have had no new revelation concerning it; but it is ten to one, but when we dye we shall find the state of affairs wholly differing from all our opinions here, and that no man of sect hath guessed any thing at all of it as it is. Here I intend not to dispute, but to perswade, and therefore <HI>in the general,</HI>
<PB N="337" REF="197">
if it be probable that they know or feel the benefits done to them, though but by a re|flex revelation from God, or some under communication from an Angel, or the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ock of acquired notices here below, it may the rather endear us to our charities or duties to them respectively; since our vertues use not to live upon abstracti|ons, and Metaphysical per|fections, or inducements;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE> but <HI>then</HI> thrive when they have materiall arguments;<NOTE PLACE="marg">&mdash;<GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Il.</HI> &dagger;.</NOTE> such which are not too far from sense. However it be it is certain they are not dead, and though we no more see the souls of our dead friends then we did when they were alive, yet we have reason to beleeve them to know more things and better: And if our sleep be an image of death, we may also ob|serve concerning it, that it is a state of life so separate from communications with the body, that it is one of the wayes of <HI>Oracle</HI> and prophecy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">H <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Cyrus apud Xenop. lib.</HI> 8. <HI>instit.</HI></NOTE> by which the soul best de|clares her immortality, and the noblenesse of her acti|ons, and powers, if she could get free from the body, (as in the state of separation) or a clear dominion over it, (as in the resurrection): To which also this con|sideration may be added, that men long time lived the life of sence, before they use their <HI>reason</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Illiad.</HI> &dagger;.</NOTE> and till they have sumished their head with experiments and notices of many things,
<PB N="338" REF="198">
they cannot at all discourse of any thing; but when they come to use their reason, all their knowledge is nothing but <HI>remembrance</HI>; and we know by proportions, by similitudes and dissimilitudes, by relations and oppositi|ons, by causes and effects, by comparing things with things; all which are nothing, but operations of understanding upon the stock of former notices, of something we knew before; <HI>nothing but remembrances</HI>; all the heads of Topicks which are the stock of all arguments and sciences in the world are a cer|tain demonstration of this: And he is the wisest man that remembers most, and joyns those remembrances together to the best pur|poses of discourse. From whence it may not be improbably gathered, that in the state of se|paration if there be any act of understanding, that is, if the understanding be alive, it must be relative to the notices it had in this world, and therefore the acts of it must he discourses upon all the parts and persons of their con|versation and relation, excepting onely such new revelations which may be communicated to it; concerning which we know nothing. But if by seeing <HI>Sacrates</HI> I think upon <HI>Plato,</HI> and by seeing a picture I remember a Man, and by beholding two friends I remember my own, and my friends need, (and he is wisest that drawes most lines from the same Centre, and most discourses from the same Notices) it cannot but be very probable to beleeve, since the separate souls understand better, if they understand at all, that from the Notices they carried from hence, and what they find there equall or unequall to those
<PB N="339" REF="198" MS="y">
Notices, they can better discover the things of their friends then we can here by our con|jectures, and craftiest imaginations: and yet many men here can guesse shrewdly at the thoughts and designes of such men with whom they discourse, or of whom they have heard, or whose characters they prudently have perceived. I have no other end in this discourse, but that we may be ingaged to do our duty to our Dead; lest peradventure they should perceive our neglect, and be witnes|ses of our transient affections, and forgetful|nesse. Dead persons have religion passed up|on them, and a solemn reverence; and if we think a Ghost beholds us, it may be we may have upon us the impressions likely to be made by <HI>love,</HI> and <HI>fear,</HI> and <HI>religion.</HI> How|ever, we are sure that God sees us, and the world sees us; and if it be matter of duty to|wards our Dead, <HI>God will exact it:</HI> if it be matter of kindnesse, <HI>the world will:</HI> and as <HI>Religion</HI> is the band of that, so <HI>fame and repu|tation</HI> is the endearment of this.</P>
<P>It remains, that we who are alive should so live, and by the actions of Religion at|tend the coming of the day of the Lord, that we neither be surprized, nor leave our du|ties imperfect, nor our sins uncanceld, nor our persons unreconciled, nor God unap|peased: but that when we descend to our graves we may rest in the bosome of the Lord, till the mansions be prepared, where we shall sing and feast eternally. Amen.</P>
<P>Te Deum laudamus.</P>
