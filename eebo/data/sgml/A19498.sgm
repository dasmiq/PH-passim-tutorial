<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HO|NOVRABLE, <HI>DAVID,</HI> LORD OF SCONE, <HI>ONE OF HIS MAIE|sties</HI> most Honorable Priuy Coun|cell in this Kingdome.</HEAD>
<P>_MY Lord; when I dedicated to the Earle of Dunbar, of good memo|ry, my Treatise of the <HI>Anatomy of a Christian,</HI> I was then of purpose to haue presented to your L. this <HI>Holy Alphabet for Si|ons Scholars;</HI> but could not per|fit it till now. Ye liued together in his Maiesties most honourable seruice, like a paire of faithfull friends; <HI>louing and plea|sant in your liues,</HI> and shall not be diuided in your deaths for me. As my other Treatise went forth for a witnesse of my fauour without flattery toward him (for the Dedica|torie Epistle was printed after his death) so will I that this stand as a testimonie of my loue toward your L. partly for that which yee are&punc; and partly for that which I hope yee shall be: <HI>Ille enim veraciter amat amicum, qui Deum amat in amico; aut quia est in illo, aut vt sit in illo.</HI> For he doth truely loue his friend&punc; who loueth God in his friend: that is, eyther for the good which is in him; or else, that the good which he wants may be in him.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">There are many in this age, with whom Satan hath coue|nanted, as <HI>Nahash</HI> the Ammonit would haue done with the Israelites of Iabesh Golead, vpon this condition, That he put out their right eies. These men haue an eye to see, and a tong to speake of that, which is euill in another; but none to se&punc; that which is good: compared properly by <HI>Nazianzen,</HI> to venemous flyes; who passing by the part that is whole, light vpon that which is sore, and make it worse then they sound it. For mine owne part, I neuer mind to be one of these. If I should praise you for the good which ye want, I knowe I should neyther please you nor prosite you; your vnder stan|ding being more solid, then that shadowes in stead of sub|stance, can content you: neyther yet also, on the other hand, will I so looke vnto that, which ye want, that I passe by the good which ye haue; vnder hope also that this shall make you better.</P>
<P>There are none who knowe your L. but haue marked an affection toward Religion so indiuert<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ble, that no man con|trary minded, durst euer attempt to alter it: which in this declining age deserues no small commendation. A heart in like maner toward execution of iustice, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> inslexible, that ye haue preferred the lawe to the loue of men, who otherway haue bin most deere vnto you: for the which howsoeuer yee haue beene misliked of many; yet haue you proued a profita|ble seruant to your Master in most difficill times: for <HI>By iustice the Throne is established.</HI> Your naturall iudge|ment in discerning betweene right and wrong, may iustly be admired: specially sith your education hath not been by pre|cepts of artes, in the Academie; but by practise of them in the Palace: where unto yee could also hardly haue at|tained, if yee had not learned vnden such a King, as is not onely a patterns of vertue himselfe; but a solid Thealog and Philosopher, euer discussing to his Dome|stiques of that which is good and euill, both in Religion, manners, and policie.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">But my Lord; howsoeuer these be good things, and wor|thy commendation, yet haue they need to be strengthenea with better: for all gifts, were they neuer so excellent, if they be not crowned with godlinesse, may well increase conuiction; but can render no consolation in the day of trouble. This is it therefore which now I haue to recom|mend vnto your L. that yee growe in knowledge and in the grace of our Lorde Iesus Christ: whereunto, be|side these common reasons that should stirre vp cuerie Christian; there are three which more particularly pro|uoke you vnto it.</P>
<P>The first is, that GOD by your first generation hath brought you forth a man of honour in this earth: for in regard of naturall descent, your honourable Father, the Lorde of <HI>Baluaird,</HI> was a brother of the Earle of <HI>Tullibardin;</HI> whose house is as a noble stocke, from which hath sprung out, like branches, exceeding many honourable Families, all of the name of <HI>Murray,</HI> and hath continued in this Lande these fifteene hundreth yeares.</P>
<P>Your Mother, a <HI>Grahame,</HI> daughter of the right Noble Earle of <HI>Montrose;</HI> whose house hath continued with honour since the beginning of this Kingdome.</P>
<P>Your Mothers mother, a <HI>Keith,</HI> daughter to the right noble Earle <HI>Mershell;</HI> whose House and Family being long before honourable in this Kingdome, was sixe hundreth years agoe decorated with the Office of the <HI>Marshalship</HI> of Scotland&punc; for their vertue and valour in batteil; where<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> they continue vnto this day among the chiefest Peeres of the Realme. Your Fathers Mother, a <HI>Lyndsay,</HI> daughter to the right noble Lord, the Lord <HI>Lyndsay;</HI> whose Hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e not inferiour to many in honour, may aboue many most iustly he commended for their earnest z<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ale, and sincerr affection toward the aduancement of true Religion.</P>
<P>All these should greatly increase your care, that ye be no
<PB REF="4">
found lesse honourable in Christ, then ye are in this world: For this world properly is compared to a Stage-play, wher|in oftentimes Nobles are clad in beggars garments, and the beggar takes on the habite of a King; but when the guise is ended, and the maskes remoued, then euery one ap|peares to be that which he is: and the man of base estate was not so much comforted with his temporall representa|tion of an honourable man, as he is now grieued to see hee was but honourable in sport and shew, not in effect. Yet ma|ny such are there in the world, who goe in the state of hono|rable men, but shall be found in the end vessels of dishonour, To be honourable in both, is rare; yet such as may be obtey|ned by godlinesse: for godlinesse hath the promise both of this life, and of the life to come.</P>
<P>The second reason; Ye haue serued his Maiestie, these eight and thirtie yeares: not as a Domestique onely; but as a Counceller and Officer of estate also: and that with so constant an affection, that ye haue not spared to incurre the displeasure and malecontentment of any whatsoeuer; so be it ye might procure pleasure and contentment to your Master. My Lord; at yee haue learned to serue most faithfully a King on earth, and for good seruice haue re|ceiued the recompence of his Princely liberality: so thinke with your selfe how greatly ye shall be conuinced, if ye doe not learne to serue the King of heauen; whose wage to his seruants doth as farre exceed any thing yee haue, as the heauens are aboue the earth.</P>
<P>The third is; Ye are now striken in yeares, your Almond tree is flourished: these fiftie and eight yeares hath God spa|red you, and not taken you away in your ignorances and sinnes, as he hath done many others, both at your right hand, and at the left. My Lord; the patience of God is called long, but his mercy euerlasting: the vse of his mercy toward his owne, is to beare with them, till they be deliuered into the hands of his mercie: then are they out of all dan|ger;
<PB REF="4">
for his mercy endures for euer: and whom once he re|ceiues, he neuer casts away again. But wo is to the wicked: for they abuse Gods patience, to fulfill the measure of their iniquity; heaping vp wrath to themselues by the multipli|cation of sinnes, as it were in a treasure against the day of wrath. Thus as the Fish of Iorden goe sprinkling and play|ing in the streame thereof, till at length they fall into the Loch or salt Sea of Sodome, where they die: so are all the wicked, abusing Gods patience, carried on by their deceit|full pleasures of sin, to a miserable end. For where in their young yeares they will not repent, in their olde age custome of sinne so confirmes them in euill, that they cannot repent; no more then a Leopard can change his spots, or a Blacke Moore his colour. Of this your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">may perceiue that God his long pattence, whereby he spares a man, is not a blessing, if mercy to pardon sins past, and grace to renne for the time to come, doe not follow it: yea, rather, <HI>quo diutius expe|ctat&punc; districtius iudicabit;</HI> the longer he tarie and spare, the sharper will he strike when he comes. Let this waken in your L. a care to redeeme the time, and a resolution to sa|crifice the residue of your few yeares vnto the Lord your God.</P>
<P>For which cause it shall not be vnprofitable your L. re|member these counsels: first, that ye examine diligently your by-gon life; <HI>No man knowes the things of a man, but the spirit of a man:</HI> this will tell you more of your selfe, then all the world can tell you. In this examination spare not your selfe, if you would haue God to spare you: iudge your selfe, accuse your selfe, correct your selfe, and GOD shall not iudge you. Remember when yee come to iudgement, there will be none to stand against you, if it be not your owne sinnes: so long therfore as you haue time, fall vpon them, fight with them, and doe all that ye can to vndoe them.</P>
<P>Where, if your L. would know how is it that a man may
<PB REF="5">
vndoe the euill which he hath done; The answer is, that two manner of waies ye may doe it: first, if with good <HI>Eze|chia</HI> ye recount your by-gon sinnes in the bitternesse of your heart; mourning for them euer when ye thinke vpon them&punc; and with the eyes of faith looke to him, who being righte|ous, died for our sinnes: sending vp strong supplications to God, that by the merit of Christs death your sinnes may be buried in the graue, and haue neuer place to stand against you in iudgement. If they be such as may be m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">nded by re|stitution, faile not to do it, after the manner of good <HI>Zac|cheus:</HI> if they be not of that nature, mend them by doing the contrarie good. This is that holie reuenge which the Apostle commends as a not able effect of repentance, That we should be reuenged of our by-gon euils, by doing the good which we know is most contrarie vnto them.</P>
<P>This being done for annulling of your by-gon sinnes; let your next care be to rectifie your life for the time to come&punc; <HI>Salomon</HI> saies, The end of a thing is better the~ the begin|ning thereof. His meaning is of good things: for euill men waxe worse and worse; but an elect man by grace makes his latter end better then his beginning; and they who are planted in the Courts of the Lords house, flourish and bring forth fruit, euen in their olde daies.</P>
<P>And here againe I recommend to your L. a three fold duetie. First, remember how manie are the obligation&punc; vvherein ye stand bound to the Lord your God: thinke vp|pon that question of godlie <HI>Dauid; What shall I render to the Lord for all his benefits to me?</HI> Take an answer for it, out of these vvords of <HI>Salomon; My sonne giue me thine heart.</HI> Euerie morning offer vnto the Lord <HI>Pri|mitias cordis, &amp; oris tui;</HI> the first fruits of your heart and mouth: thinke vpon nothing before yee thinke on him; speake of nothing till first yee speake vnto him; be feruent and continuall in prayer. <HI>Si non semper precamur&punc; sem|per debemus habere paratum precantis affectu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">f
<PB REF="5">
we be not alway praying, we should alway haue readie a heart disposed to pray. The vessels of mercy should smell of mercie; and the Temples of God should neuer want the sa|crifices of God: giue to the Lord both the thankes, and the seruice of all the good ye haue receiued from him. Many giue him verball thankes for his benefites, acknowledging themselues debitors to him for the good which they haue; who will not serue him with his owne benefites. Let these men know, that their thanks are not acceptable to him.</P>
<P>The second point of your care, I would haue entended to the poore and needy: as ye haue receiued mercy from God, or looke to get it, shew mercy for Gods sake to such as are vnder you. <HI>Salomon</HI> saith, The mercies of the wicked are crueltie; but the mercies of a righteous man extend euen toward his beast: how much more then will he be mercifull to his Christian brother? Remember what comfort <HI>Iob</HI> found in the day of his trouble, arising from this, <HI>That he</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob 31.</NOTE> <HI>restrained not the poore of their desire, and caused not the eyes of the widdow to faile: that he did not eate his morsels alone, but the fatherlesse eat thereof: that he saw none perish for want of clothing, nor suffered the poore to be without a couering: that the loynes of the poore blessed him, because hee was warmed with the fleece of his sheepe.</HI> It is a great grace, where a man, not onely sets his owne heart to praise God; but hyreth the heart and tongue of others to praise God with him, and for him: therfore <HI>To do good and to distribute forget not,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 13.</NOTE> <HI>for with such sacrifices God is pleased.</HI></P>
<P>And with these, thinke it a peece of your honour to honor the seruants of the Lord. <HI>Beautifull,</HI> saith <HI>Esay, are the feet of those, who bring the glad tidings of peace:</HI> If their feet be beautifull&punc; what should their face be? Looke not to their weakenesse; but for their Master and their message sake, esteeme them alwayesarorthy to be welcom|ed. And sith they pray vnto God for your L. be loth to re|fuse
<PB REF="6">
them in their reasonable requests to you; remembring that reason which <HI>Ambrose</HI> vsed to <HI>Theodose</HI> the Em|perour: <HI>Si dignus non sum qui &agrave; te audiar, nec etiam dignus qui pro te &agrave; deo exaudiar;</HI> If I be not worthy that I should be heard of thee when I speake vnto thee, farre lesse am I worthy that I should be heard of God, when I speake to him for thee.</P>
<P>The third is, that ye haue a continuall care of your selfe. Nature can teach you to care for those things which are yours: but it is grace must learne you to care for your selfe. Satan is a restlesse tempter; but yet so subtill, that he can frame his temptations according to the ages and states of men: he tempts not children as he doth young men; ney|ther tempts hee young men as hee doth the aged; neyther tempts he the aged as he doth any of the other two. Hee tempts children with folly, and playes with them, as the Prouerb is, at the belly blinde; seeking no more of that age, but that it be passed ouer with foolish and friuolous things. Young men againe he tempts to wickednesse, many wayes, by the fury of their inordinate concupiscence: these are called by the Apostle, <HI>The noysome lusts of youth.</HI> Aged men most commonly he tempts them with couetous|nesse, and excessiue cares of the vvorld. <HI>Omnia in homi|ne c&ugrave;msenescunt vitia, sola iuuenescit auaritia:</HI> When all other sinnes waxe olde and feeble in a man, onely coue|tousnesse waxeth young, and increaseth her strength. And who can tell how miserable that man is, vvho in his childe|hood liued like a foole&punc; in his youth vva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> filthy, in his olde age a vvorldling; vnlesse God by grace bring him out of that fearfull bondage?</P>
<P>I speake not this as if I for ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> the vse of this vvorld, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">id condemne all care thereof, or those lawfull pleasures your L. takes in building&punc; planting; or other such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> ver|tues, wherein ye stand vnto all that are about you a pat|terne of policy: but to warne you, that ye walke cere <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">|spectly&punc;
<PB REF="6">
vsing this world as if ye vsed it not. What-euer your actions be about it, set your affections vpon better things; knowing, as saith the Apostle, that the shape and figure of this world goes away. It is vvisedome to forsake this vvorld vvith our vvill, before we be forced to forsake it against our vvill: to leaue it euen when we do possesse it. <HI>Abraham</HI> liued not so long as did many of his fathers; yet when he died, it is said of him that he died full of dayes, be|cause he desired no mo. Sith ye know ye must remoue, be prepared like Israel in Egypt, with their loines girded, and their staues in their handes, ready to march forward from Egypt to Canaan. Be content with the dayes ye haue got|ten: line so, as not needing any moe; but vse euery day, as if it were your last day: after which, if God giue you another, take it as a <HI>super-plus,</HI> and be thankefull to him for it.</P>
<P>For all these causes which I haue premitted, and that the seed of godlinesse, which these many yeares I haue kno|wen in you&punc; breeding spirituall remorse with teares, and godly holy desires, may at length be cherished and brought forward, both to the flourishing and further fructifying; I hau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> here presented to your L. these Meditations, which I ordinarily deliuered to my people, in time of their euening Prayers; and haue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> it, <HI>A holy Alphabet,</HI> or <HI>A.

<P>Accept it, reade it, practise it, right Honourable: steppe forward in the godd course which now ye haue happ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">y be|gun: and these good conclusions, which I know ye haue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> with your selfe, may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 words"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">orth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">; that so the world may see by the fruit, that the tree growes euerth&punc; longer the better.

this Psalme we may see, <HI>Dauid</HI> can make no end of prayer: and this may make vs ashamed of our cold, faint, and feeble prayers.</P>
<P>This Verse containes a prayer, with a rea|son<NOTE PLACE="marg">Men are care|lesse to seeke God, because they know not what a iewell he is.</NOTE> of the prayer. The prayer is, <HI>Teach me thy Statutes:</HI> the reason, mouing him to seeke this, ariseth of a consideration of that infinite good which is in GOD. He is a blessed GOD, the Fountaine of all felicitie; without whom no welfare, nor happinesse can bee to the crea|ture. And for this cause, <HI>Dauid</HI> earnestly desi|ring to be in fellowship and communion with GOD, which hee knowes none can attaine vnto, vnlesse he be taught of GOD to know Gods way, and walke in it: therefore, I say, prayeth he the more earnestly, that the Lord would teach him his Statutes.

This me|ditation would weaken or diminish in vs those vnquiet and fruitlesse cares wee haue to en|ioy the creature: for, alas, man seekes the crea|tures as if his life, and happinesse stood in them; but is negligent in the seeking of the Lord: and all because he knowes not, that his blessed|nesse stands in a communion with the blessed God.</P>

<P>Againe, <HI>Dauid</HI> was a Prophet himselfe, and a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Such as haue solid know|ledge of salua|tion, desire to know more.</NOTE> man of great knowledge, and yet often craues he that God would teach him more.

<P>THese two last verses of this Section, pre|sent<NOTE PLACE="marg">A threefold in|ternall action of the soule a|bout the word.</NOTE> to vs a threefold internall action of <HI>Dauid</HI> his soule, toward the word of God: first, Meditation; secondly, Considerati|on; thirdly, Delectation: euery one of these pro|ceeds from other, and mutually strengthen one another. Meditation brings the word to the mind: Consideration views it, &amp; looks at length into it; wherof is bred Delectation. That which<NOTE PLACE="marg">&lindx;</NOTE> comes into the mind, word it neuer so good, if it be not considered, gods as it came; leauing ney|ther instruction, nor ioy: but being once presen|ted by meditation, if it be pondred by considera|tion, then it breeds delectation&punc; w^c^h is the perfe|ction of godlines, in regard of the internal action.</P>
<P>Thus we see, that a godly man is euer fruitfull<NOTE PLACE="marg">How a godly man is euer fruitfull in good.</NOTE> in good: like that tree, planted by the riuers of waters. For at that same time when his externall good actions cannot be seene, he is not without internall good motions, breeding good in the root of his affection; which shortly brings out good fruit in his action, to the glory of God, and good of others.</P>

<P><HI>In thy Precepts.</HI>] The minde of man is restless,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The minde of man is restlesse, and vexes it selfe with euill, if it be not ex|ercised with good.</NOTE> and cannot lie idle.

<P>A meet subiect for meditation to the minde of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gods word should be the matter of our meditation.</NOTE> man, is the precepts of the word of God: be|cause, as they are from God vnto vs; so are they for vs, and we must be answerable to God for them. Earthly Lords, in their commandments to their seruants, seek their own aduantage: it is not so with the Lord our God; all his commande|ments are for the vantage and benefite of his ser|uants: <HI>Nihil iubet quod sibi profit.

So then, because by it God commeth downe to men, and by it men go vp vnto God, and know how to get accesse to him; therefore is his word called his way.</P>

<P>_MAny states of life did <HI>Dauid</HI> change:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The word of God is conue|nient for euery state of life.</NOTE> but his hart neuer changed from the Lord, &amp; the loue of his word.

For the Serpents curse is vpon him, he creepes on the earth, and licks the dust all the daies of his life.

then is it said that the Lord rested. No sight of the creature, could content the Lord, till hee had seen man: all the thoughts of the diuine mind<NOTE PLACE="marg">&lindx;</NOTE> aymed at him.

They teach vs to second our de|terminations vvith prayers: both be|cause our purposes shall perish if God blesse them not, as Psal. 127; as also, for that Satan then doth most busily impugne vs, when hee sees wee haue most resolutely concluded to serue the Lord.</P>
<P>Three things are to be obserued in <HI>Dauids</HI> prai|er.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three things obserued in Dauids prayer. 1 His Reue|rence.</NOTE> 1. His reuerence. 2. His sinceritie. 3. His faith. His reuerence is heere, that he made his supplica|tion in Gods presence: if we did so thinke when we go to pray, we goe to shew our selues in Gods presence, how would it humble vs in our selues, &amp; make vs reuerent toward God? Wee know what we do when we come before Kings of the earth; wee prepare our selues, wee come with the reue|rence of <HI>Hester</HI> to <HI>Ahasuerus;</HI> of <HI>Bathsheba</HI> to <HI>Da|uid&punc;</HI> and good reason so we should doe. But how much are we bound to do as <HI>Abraham</HI> did, when wee come before the Lord, to remember wee are but dust &amp; ashes? and that it is a great benefit that wee should get license to speake to the <HI>Righteous</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The like reue|rence recom|mended to vs.</NOTE> <HI>Iudge of all the world.</HI> And this reuerence our Sa|uiour commends vnto vs, when in the preface of the prayer which he hath taught vs, he remem|bers
<PB N="147" REF="80">
vs, that our father, to whom we speak, is in heauen: we should not be rash with our mouth, nor hasty in our hart to vtter a thing before God: For God, saith <HI>Salomon,</HI> is in heauen, and we are<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccles. 5.</NOTE> in the earth. Let faith mooue our harts to goe to him when we haue neede: let feare bridle vs, that we be not suddaine, but first temper our harts, ere wee speake with our tongue to so reuerent a Ma|iestie. It is abhomination to offer vnto the Lord the <HI>Sacrifice of fooles;</HI> that is, words without af|fection: and yet, alas, how often doth our in|firmitie miscarie vs to doe so! <HI>Magni cert&egrave; inge|nij</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">August.</NOTE> <HI>est seuocare mentem &agrave; sensibus, &amp; cogitati|onem &agrave; consuetudine abducere.</HI> It is a worke of great difficultie in prayer, to sunder our soule fro~ our senses, and to withdrawe our cogitations from their custome.</P>
<P>The second thing to be obserued in his praier,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The second is his Sinceritie.</NOTE> is his sinceritie; in these words, <HI>With my vvhole hart.</HI> Hypocrisie is a vile sinne in dealing with men: but much more abhominable, when by it men presume to mocke the Lord; making a shew in his presence of that which they are not. <HI>Rebec|ca</HI> decked vp <HI>Iacob</HI> in so subtile a maner, that <HI>Isaac</HI> his father mistooke him: but Satan, now pranks vp his cou~terfet Christians in more subtil maner; for there <HI>Isaac</HI> tooke some notice of him by his voice: but now men haue learned to speak so cun|ningly<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against a false hart, vnder a faire tongue.</NOTE> and Christian-like, that hardly can a man think, how a false hart should lodge vnder so faire<NOTE PLACE="marg">&lindx;</NOTE>
<PB N="148" REF="81">
a tongue. But let not men deceiue themselues, God wil not be deceiued: his eyes are not dimme<NOTE PLACE="marg">&rindx;</NOTE> as <HI>Isaacs;</HI> but liuely, quick, and pearcing, like vn|to flames of fire: he can see they are but a <HI>potshard ouer laid with siluer drosse;</HI> and a little time shall<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pro. 26. 23.</NOTE> discouer them. <HI>Certum est, nihil simulatum aut fictum verae esse virtutis, sed nec diuturnum:</HI> for it is sure, that a counterfeit thing can neuer haue solid vertue, nor continuance in it. Let vs studie with <HI>Dauid,</HI> to make our hart good &amp; vp|right before God.</P>
<P>The third thing to be marked in his prayer, is<NOTE PLACE="marg">The third is his faith.</NOTE> his faith, grounded vpon the promises of God, in these words, <HI>Be mercifull vnto me, according to thy promise.</HI> He protested before, that he sought the Lord from his whole hart; and now he pray|eth he may find mercie. So it is indeede; boldlie may that man looke for mercy at Gods hand, vvho seekes him truely: there <HI>Mercie and Truth meet together, and embrace one another:</HI> where truth is in the soule to seeke, there cannot be but mercie in GOD to embrace. If truth be in vs to confesse our sinnes &amp; forsake them, wee shal find mercy in God to pardon and forgiue them.</P>
<P>Again, we see that as our prayers should be sent<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prayers of ba|stard Christi|ans, nothing different from the prayers of Turkes.</NOTE> vp in Christes name, so shold they be grou~ded on Gods promises. It is a shame that the prayers of many Christians, are nothing different from the prayers of Turks: for what shall ye heare among them, but the like of these voyces, God helpe vs,
<PB N="149" REF="81">
God be mercifull to vs: these are prayers which<NOTE PLACE="marg">&lindx;</NOTE> any Ethnique will make in time of his distresse, but we must learne to frame our prayers another way; when we pray, wee must pray in the name of Christ, and to be heard for Christes sake, be|cause he is the Mediator, and peace-maker be|tweene God and man, and in him the father is well pleased. And againe, wee must not take li|bertie to seeke what wee like, out of our corrupt humors, as the custome of many is; but we must ground our prayers vpon Gods promises, which in Christ Iesus he hath made vnto vs.</P>
<P>And lastly, seeing this is an argument which<NOTE PLACE="marg">God promiseth of mercy, wee promise of du|tie.</NOTE> commonly we vse to moue God to be mercifull vnto vs, Because he hath so promised; if we wold haue this argument forcible, let vs make consci|ence of those promises which we haue made vnto God.

It is not with God, as it is with man; a man, the more he giueth, the lesse he hath: it is not so with the Lord. Among men, this is a reason as they alledge, why they should not giue, I haue giuen you already, why then doe yee trouble mee any more? but it is not so with God; the treasures of his grace can neuer be emptied: whom he loues, he loues vnto the end; and to him that hath, hee giueth more.

<P>THis Verse consists of a thankesgiuing;<NOTE PLACE="marg">To praise God in affliction is a great grace.</NOTE> wherin he ascribes to the Lord the praise of truth and righteousnesse, in afflicting him. Many vse to praise God in prosperity, who in time of trouble, impatient of his hea|uie hand, murmure against him: but such as are truly godly, do then blesse the Lord most hearti|ly, when he seems to deale with them most hard|ly; giuing him the praise of equity, and acknow|ledging<NOTE PLACE="marg">&lindx;</NOTE>
<PB N="190" REF="102">
that his greatest rodds are not so great as their sins; as also the praise of fidelity, that accor|ding to his word, he afflicts his children, for no o|ther cause but to purge them, and make them more capable of grace and consolation.</P>
<P><HI>I know.</HI>] How is this seeing the Apostle saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All Gods waies are righteous, suppose we see them not.</NOTE> <HI>Rom.</HI> II. that the iudgements of God are vnsearch|able, and his waies past finding out? The answer is: <HI>Dauid</HI> doth not so speake, as if he were priuy to al the secret waies of God; but that thus much hee knew in generall: that all his iudgements, whereby he strikes eyther the godly or the wic|ked, were all right; suppose the causes and parti|cular ends of them were secret. And this know|ledge is learned out of the word: <HI>The Lord is righ|teous in all his workes, and holy in all his wayes.</HI> And againe, <HI>All the wayes of God are mercie and truth to them that feare him.</HI> And againe, <HI>All things worke for the best to them that loue him.</HI></P>
<P>And it is the want of this knowledge that<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ignorance of this makes men murmure where they haue no cause.</NOTE> makes vs oftentimes to murmure or faint, and be discouraged at the works of God; apprehen|ding in our ignorance, that to be euill which in Gods working is good, and directed to a good end.

<P><PB N="191" REF="102"><HI>That thy iudgement.</HI>] The iudgement of God<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iudgement put for plagues, and for corre|ctions.</NOTE> is taken in two significations: first, for the plagues whereby hee punisheth wicked men in his an|ger, proportionall to their sinnes. And this iudgement <HI>Dauid</HI> declines, <HI>Psal.</HI> 143. <HI>Enter not into iudgement with thy seruant:</HI> Secondly, for the roddes and corrections, wherewith hee chastiseth his owne children.

<P>Secondly, we marke here the great weakenesse and infirmity of Gods children, who oftentimes<NOTE PLACE="marg">It is mans in|firmity to be cast down with tentations co~ming from men more then those that come from God.</NOTE> are more discouraged w^t^h those tentations which come immediatly from men, then with those o|thers which com immediatly from God; in the one they stand strong; in the other they faint and are ouercome.

<PB N="260" REF="138">
of Gods promises. And this is an instability<NOTE PLACE="marg">1.

<P>The other is an instability of loue &amp; obedience:<NOTE PLACE="marg">2.

But now, many so leane to the shewe of their conversion, that they are carelesse of the grace of confirmation: wherof it comes to passe, that they end in the flesh, who made a shew of be|ginning in the Spirit; not considering these two distinct graces requisite to saluation, Conuersion, and Confirmation. Let vs therefore still pray<NOTE PLACE="marg">&lindx;</NOTE> with <HI>Dauid,</HI> that God would stablish and con|firme vs.</P>
<P><HI>According to thy promise.</HI>] The prayers of<NOTE PLACE="marg">The prayers of godly me~, how they are fra|med.</NOTE> the godly, are poured out in faith; they seek no|thing but according to Gods promise. Many do otherwise; who pray, neither looking to Gods promise, nor leaning to the Mediator: such prayers, are vvords poured out into the ayre, and carried away with the wind. Yet others are more profane; who pray not onely without a promise, but against the commaund of God: for either when they goe to doe wickedlie, they pray GOD to prosper them; or else, in their pertur|bations, they cry for vengeance on their neigh|bours, where they should cry for mercy. These praiers are the offring of strange fire to the Lord; which is abhomination.</P>
<P>Yet are wee to remember, that if wee vvould<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gods promises are made on a co~ditio~, which we must regard</NOTE> haue our prayers grounded well vpon Gods pro|mises, wee must also remember the condition, whereupon hee hath made the promise.

<P>And this life is known, by these two notable effects; for first, it brings a ioyfull sense of Gods mercy: and next, a spirituall disposition to spiri|tuall exercises.

<Q>It is time for thee to worke: for they haue destroyed thy Lawe.</Q>

<P>HEe hath complained before of the op|pression<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dauids com|plaint against his enemies.</NOTE> of his aduersaries; &amp; besought the Lord to arme him against them, with knowledge &amp; vnderstanding: now he com|plaines their iniquity was come to such a height, that they did giue battell euen to God himselfe; and were not only enemies to <HI>Dauid,</HI> but such as had done what they could to destroy the law of God. So the verse containes a prayer, that God would work; and a reason, taken from the ripe|nesse of the wickednesse of his enemies.</P>
<P>According to our sense, there is a time wherin
<PB N="284" REF="150">
God worketh not: whereof proceedes in the<NOTE PLACE="marg">God is a conti|nuall working vertue, euen when we think he is resting.</NOTE> godlie the like of these complaints; <HI>Arise Lord, why sleepest thou? How long wilt thou forget?</HI> It is true, in himselfe hee is a continuall working vertue; but wee, beeing ignorant of the waies whereby he walkes to his owne end, think some|time that hee is not working, because hee is not executing: although euen then, when wee so thinke, hee be most busily working a way, to ef|fect his owne determinate conclusion.</P>
<P>But how is this, that hee prescribeth a time to<NOTE PLACE="marg">How Dauid prescribes a time to the Lord.</NOTE> the Lord? Is not this to fall into that fault, which is reprooued, Psalme 78? <HI>They limited the Holie one of Israel.</HI></P>
<P>For answere of this; GOD hath made some promises with a time, declaring to his children when hee would performe them. So hee promi|sed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some promi|ses made with a time when they shall be performed.</NOTE> to free <HI>Abrahams</HI> seede, from the Egyptian persecution, after foure hundred yeeres; as hee did: for it was no lesse between the beginning of that persecution in <HI>Ismael</HI> mocking <HI>Isaac,</HI> &amp; the deliuerance from it, in <HI>Pharao</HI> oppressing <HI>Israel</HI> with burdens.</P>
<P>Again, he promised to bring <HI>Israel</HI> out of <HI>Babel</HI> after seauenty yeers: and therfore the godly, who thought very long for expiring of that date, prai|ed earnestly, that God would haue mercy on <HI>Si|on,</HI> because the appointed time was come. So al|so, he promised to send <HI>Shiloh,</HI> the true deliuerer of his people, at that time when the Scepter shold
<PB N="285" REF="150">
depart from <HI>Israel:</HI> and therefore at that time, <HI>Simeon</HI> waited for the consolation, and his eyes saw the saluation, of God.</P>
<P>Other promises againe hee makes without a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some without a time.</NOTE> time; that is, not telling when he will performe them. He put <HI>Noah</HI> in the Ark; but told him not when hee would bring him out: and hee taried a yeere and a day, waiting Gods time with pati|ence. He sent <HI>Ioseph</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI> into Egypt, com|maunding them to tarie there, till he told them: they inquired not how long; neither did hee tell them: Learning vs, when God layes a crosse on vs, not to capitulate with him, concerning the time of our deliuerance; but patiently to beare it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In these wee should haue pa|tience waiting till Gods time come.</NOTE> till his time come. It was <HI>Sauls</HI> ouer-hastiness; he taried for <HI>Samuel</HI> seauen daies, but would tarie no longer. And it was the blasphemous speech of <HI>Iehoram,</HI> Why should I attend any longer?</P>
<P>Let vs not dishonour the Lord, by prescribing a time to him. If he should alway tell vs the time of our deliuerance, the praise of our patience should be the lesse, and our prayer the colder: but when hee conceales the time, and wee with pati|ence<NOTE PLACE="marg">&lindx;</NOTE> wait vpon it; we giue good proofe of our faith and patience, and finde our deliuerance the sweeter when it comes.</P>
<P>Yet in publick troubles of the Church, when<NOTE PLACE="marg">When the god|ly may vse this reason in their prayer, The time is come.</NOTE> the pride of the enemie is become great, and the cup of the Amo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ites seemes to be full; when the children of God, are brought low, &amp; their soules

humbled to the dust; it is no limitation of the Lord, when with <HI>Dauid</HI> they pray, that GOD would haue mercy on them, because the time is come.</P>
<P><HI>For they haue destroyed thy law.</HI>] It is a great proofe of true godlinesse, when we are more dis|pleased<NOTE PLACE="marg">Offences done against God, should grieue vs more then our owne iniu|ries.</NOTE> with offences done against the Lord our GOD, then with such as are done against our selues. But it is now far otherwise with most part of Professors: so that they bee not preiudiced in their names, and commodities, they care not what be done against the glory of God. An eui|dent argument, that they neuer loued him.</P>
<P>In the second verse of this Section, hee com|plained,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Godly me~ haue no enemies, but such as are enemies to God.</NOTE> that the proud would oppresse him: now he complaineth, that they destroyed the law of God. Who then are <HI>Dauids</HI> enemies, and seek to oppresse him? Onely such as are enemies to God, and seeke to destroy his law. A great com|fort haue we in this, that if we loue the Lord, and studie in a good conscience to serue him, wee can haue no enemies, except such as are enemies to God. And so long as God wants his due at their hands, that is, loue and seruice; may not wee be content to want their affection toward vs? Tru|ly, it should greatly increase our patience, to re|member, that if they were not enemies to God, they would neuer be ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> enemies.</P>

<P>IN this verse are two protestatio~s. In the first,<NOTE PLACE="marg">As the minde esteemes of any thing, the affec|tions go after it</NOTE> he declares how he esteemed of Gods word in his minde: in the second, how in his affec|tion he was disposed toward it. As the minde of a man esteemes of any thing, so are his affections moued to flie or follow it. It is shame for many professors, now to say they esteeme of Gods word, when they shew their affections more set vpon any thing in the world, then vpon it.</P>
<P><HI>Most iust.</HI>] In two respects is the word of God<NOTE PLACE="marg">The word of God called iust in two respects.</NOTE> iust: first, because it commands nothing, but that which is most reasonable; and next, because it shal not faile one iot, but the euent of things shall bee according to the predictions of this word. What cause haue we then to reioice, That how e|uer our tribulations be many, yet wee heare, out of this most iust word, It cannot bee but well with them that feare the Lord? And again&punc; what cause of feare is there to the wicked? when this same word saith, <HI>There is no peace to the wicked, saith my God. And a sinner of an hundred yeeres old shall dy accursed.</HI> If wee behold the wicked in their most flourishing estate, and looke to them in the glasse of the word, we shall see their misera|end, long before it come.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> of euill <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">val of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> to God.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>And I hate all false wayes.</HI>] The best tryall of
<PB N="291" REF="153">
our loue to God and his word, is the contrary; ha|tred of sin and impietie: <HI>Yee that loue the Lord hate that which is euill.</HI> He that loues a tree, hates the worme that consumes it: he that loues a gar|ment, hates the moth that eates it: he that loueth life, abhorreth death&punc; and he that loues the Lord, hates euery thing that offends him. Let men take heede to this, who are in loue of their sinnes: how can the loue of God be in them?</P>
<P><HI>All false wayes.</HI>] Religion binds vs not onely<NOTE PLACE="marg">The perfection of the godly is in parts, not in degrees.</NOTE> to hate one way of falsehood, but all the wayes of it. As there is nothing good, but in some measure a godly man loues it: so is there nothing euil, but in som measure he hates it. And this is the perfec|tion of the children of God: a perfection, not of degrees; for we neither loue good, nor hate euill as wee should: but a perfection of parts; because euery good we loue, and wee hate euery euill in some measure.</P>
<P>The worst man in the world loues some good, and hates some euill. <HI>Plerumque enim peccata hu|iusmodi</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambrose.</NOTE> <HI>sunt, vt si alterum declines, incurras alte|ru~;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">It is sufficient to mans dam|nation, if he be captiued by a|ny one sinne.</NOTE> ofttimes he that declines one sin, fals into an|other: It may be thou ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">est couetousness, &amp; yet art snared with lechery; there is one very tempe|rate of his mouth, but of a proud &amp; hauty heart; there is another not ambitious of honour, but a seruant to gluttony: <HI>Diuerso vsu in eundem inde|uotionis errorem vterque concurrit.</HI> And this is very dangerous, when as men because some good

As the butcher carries the beast to the slaughter, sometime bound by all the foure feete, and sometime by one onely: so is it with Satan. Though thou be not a slaue to all sin; if thou be a slaue to one, the gripe he hath of thee, by that one sinfull affection, is sufficient to captiue thee.</P>

<P>_THE familiarity of man with God, is<NOTE PLACE="marg">If we heare not God when hee speakes in his word&punc; we shall not be welcom when we pray.</NOTE> increased and continued by the exerci|ses of the word and prayer. For in the word, God speakes vnto men; and in prayer men speake vnto God: let not men dis|ioyne these two. For hee that cannot receiue the Lord with reuerence and obedience when hee speakes (answering him with <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Sa|muell,</HI> Here am I Lord; Speake for thy seruant heareth) shall not be welcommed of him, nor re|ceiue a fauourable answere when he praies.

They knowe him not to be the

<P>In <HI>Dauids</HI> praier, mark his variety and breuity:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our manifold necessities re|quire mani|folde prayers.</NOTE> his varietie in this, that as his necessities were manifold, so his requests; he praies for his mind, for his heart and affections, for his tongue, for his eyes, for his feet.

Finding his necessities so many, he passeth speedily from one to another; for it is a difficult thing to con|tinue our prayers long, and keepe zeale and sin|cerity: sometime so it will fall out, but very sel|dome. Yea, the children of God may obserue in their owne experience, that it is a difficult thing to pray the Lords prayer, and not to be interrup|ted in it. <HI>Augustine</HI> records of Christians in<NOTE PLACE="marg">August. ad Probam.</NOTE> Egypt, <HI>Habent preces crebras et breues, tanquam</HI>

<P>AS the life of naturall babes, is not con|serued<NOTE PLACE="marg">The word serues for food and light to the soule.</NOTE> without foode conuenient for them: so is not the life of men regenerate, preserued without the word. And as the one by natures instinct, desires to bee nourished with milke: so the other by instinct of grace, desires to be sed by the word. Neither is it to the godly as meate only, but as light also. The sure word of the prophets, Saint <HI>Peter</HI> calles it a light shining in darkenes, like as before hee called it vnmingled milke, and most necessary foode for the babes of Christ. And the spirit of God so frequently com|paring Gods word to foode and to light, will tell vs, in what miserable estate they are, who liue without it.</P>

We haue no ioy without griefe in this life: neyther yet, thankes to God, haue we griefe without ioy. As the wine failed in that banquet, whereat Christ was present: so oftentimes failes ioy, euen in the heart where Christ dwels. But as in the one he turned water into wine: so in the other will hee turne all sorrow into ioy. To haue ioy without<NOTE PLACE="marg">&lindx;</NOTE> griefe, is the condition of them who are glorified in heauen. To haue griefe without ioy, is the con|dition of them who are damned in hell; I meane, to be both without sense and hope of ioy: But the godly on earth haue their ioy mixed with griefe, and griefe tempered with ioy: and albeit sometime they want the sense of ioy, yet do they neuer want all hope and expectation of ioy.</P>

God who hath made the eyes to be Organs of sight, hath also made them to be Con|duits of teares: if we mourne as we should, when we looke to the creatures, we shall not easily be snared by them. If we look to vnreasonable crea|tures, we may see lying vpon them, the fruits of that curse, which our sinne procured: if we look to reasonable creatures, our selues or others; what a great dis-conformity is betweene vs and the holy Lawe of the Lord our God?

As for the first: Among many wayes whereby<NOTE PLACE="marg">1.

<P>And as for the great good we get by mour|ning<NOTE PLACE="marg">2.

And this is done, when a sinner powres the teares of his penitent<NOTE PLACE="marg">&lindx;</NOTE> heart into the bosome of God: then the heauens are watered by the earth. For the teares of the godly fall not to the ground: the Lord gathers them like most pretious pearles vnto him, and puts them in his bottell, and they bring still in|crease of comfort to such as shed them.

The first is, a consideration of that which God is in himselfe; namely, iust and righteous: the second, a consideration of the equity of his word: thirdly, of his constant truth, declared in his working and doing according to his word. When we find our selues tempted to distrust, by looking to the prosperity of the wicked; let vs looke vp to God, consider his nature, his word, his workes, and we shall finde comfort.</P>
<P><HI>Righteous art thou</HI>] There is the first; a medi|tation<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. A meditation of the righte|ousnesse of God.</NOTE> of the righteousnes of Gods nature: he al|ters not with times, he changes not with persons,

What he speakes of himself, he speakes it not like that Pharise, who boasted of his good, not mour|ning for his euill, nor yet longing for better.

<P>Three things haue we to consider in this his<NOTE PLACE="marg">The nature of zeale.</NOTE> his protestation: first, the nature; secondly, the sorts; thirdly, the effects of zeale. As for the na|ture of zeale; It is a mixed affection of griefe and anger, flowing from loue: for what a man loues earnestly, he is carefull to see it honoured; and, by the contrary, grieued when it is dishonoured.</P>
<P>The sorts of it are many: for according as our<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sund<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">y sorts of zeale.</NOTE> loue and griefe are, so is our zeale. If our loue be
<PB N="318" REF="167">
vpon the right obiects, moderate, in due mea|sure, it causes a zeale which is holy and spirituall: otherwise, if our loue be inordinate, it begets a carnall or inordinate zeale. Sometime the zeale is not vpon the right obiect; and then it may be great, but it cannot be good: such is the zeale of Heretiques, who compasse Sea and Land to<NOTE PLACE="marg">&rindx;</NOTE> make one of their owne profession. Sometime againe the zeale is on the right obiect, not in the due measure: eyther too colde, which is remissi|on; or too hote, which is superstition. Of these, saith the Apostle, <HI>It is a zeale, but not according to</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 10. 2.</NOTE> <HI>knowledge. Zelus ad mortem, non ad vitam;</HI> a zeale<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambrose.</NOTE> which tends to death, not vnto life.</P>
<P>The effects of <HI>Dauids</HI> zeale he toucheth, when<NOTE PLACE="marg">The effects of holy zeale.</NOTE> he saith, it had consumed him. Affections of the soule are very forcible to moue the body. A sor|rowfull heart, saith <HI>Salomon,</HI> dryes vp the bones: But men should carefully marke what spirit in|flames their zeale, and what zeale moueth their bodies. There are som, who vnder shew of zeale, or at least because they thinke it zeale, neglect the duetie which they owe to their bodies; not re|membring, the seruice which God craues of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 12.</NOTE> body is a reasonable seruice, not vnreasonable. O|thers with their zeale fight against the Gospell; so did <HI>Paul</HI> before his conuersion. Let vs try the Spirits, and see that our zeale be according to knowledge.</P>

<P>And now sith zeale must be tryed by know|ledge<NOTE PLACE="marg">How true zeale may be tried from false.</NOTE> first; let vs consider that to be the zeale of God, which fights with the armor of God, the Worde, Prayer, and patient Suffering.

<P>In the verse 150. he said that the wicked were

farre from Gods lawe: now he saith that Gods<NOTE PLACE="marg">The word of God and his saluation are conioyned to|gether.</NOTE> saluation is as farre from them. The Lord hath conioyned these two, his Word and Saluation: for by his Word hee saueth such as are to be sa|ued: they who despise the one, shall neuer finde the other. If wicked men knew this, or could ap|prehend it, they would not redeeme the plea|sures of sinne so deerely, as for them to defraude their ownesoules of saluation; despising against themselues the counsell of God.</P>
<P>And this Oracle of God should confirme vs a|gainst<NOTE PLACE="marg">Externall pro|sperity of wic|ked men not to be regarded.</NOTE> all these tentations, which arise vnto vs by looking to the prosperity, peace, and worldly pompe of the wicked.

And therefore prayes he that the work of Gods mercy may be continued with him, to quicken him, and giue him life; that he defile not his conscience by dead workes, as they doe; nor yet haue fellowship with them, in their vnfruitfull workes of darkenesse; but that being quickned by God, he may liue the life of God, from which he saw them to be strangers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Godly men e|difie their harts by euery thing they see in o|thers.</NOTE></P>

<P>Againe, the manner of the children of God in<NOTE PLACE="marg">In Gods mer|cy, not in our merit stands our comfort.</NOTE> their prayers, is, to flie alway to Gods mercy: it is of mercy, that they begin well; of mercy, that they continue well; of mercy, that they looke for any good at the hands of God: let them leane to merits who will; we wil depend vpon mercy.

And this is for the comfort of poore sinners, whose sinnes are many and great: let them not despaire; his mercies are greater and moe: for sith they are greater then all his works; how much more grea|ter then thou and all thy sinsull workes? All the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Esa. 40.</NOTE> Nations of the earth are but like the droppe of a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Comfort a|gainst the greatnesse of our sinnes.</NOTE> bucket, or as a graine of sand, compared with his Maiestie: what art thou then, that thou shouldst magnifie thy deedes aboue his rich mercie; as if thy sinnes were so great, that his mercie could not compasse them? Onely doe not abuse his mercy; neyther turne thou his grace into wan|tonnesse: but if thou vnfeinedly repent, then doe thou also stedfastly beleeue, that thy sinnes, were they neuer so great, shall easily be swallowed vp<NOTE PLACE="marg">&lindx;</NOTE> by his infinite mercies. As the Ocean, when it flowes, couers sands and rockes, and all, that they are not seene: so, where the floud of Gods com|passions breaks out, how easily doth it ouerflow and couer all thy transgressions? This is the meditation of the Apostle; that where before he<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Tim. 1.</NOTE> had beene many manner of wayes sinfull and

ignorant, a blasphemer, an oppressor, a persecu|ter; yet the grace of our Lord had beene excee|ding abundant toward him: where sinne had a|bounded, grace had superabounded, to ouer flow and couer it. And in this he stands for an exam|ple to all that will beleeue, that they should neuer distrust Gods great mercies for the greatnesse of their sinnes.</P>
<P>The other Epithet he giues them, is, That they<NOTE PLACE="marg">The mercies of God are called tender, &amp; why.</NOTE> are tender mercies; because the Lord is easie to be intreated: for he is slowe vnto wrath, but rea|dy to shew mercy. S. <HI>Iames</HI> saith, that the wisdom<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iam. 3.</NOTE> which is from aboue is gentle, peaceable, easie to be intreated.

How did that lame man lcap and exult for ioy, when hee found that <HI>Peter</HI> had restored his feet vnto him?

<P>And this ioy, which Gods children finde by<NOTE PLACE="marg">The godly find ioyfull tydings by the word, and therfore e|steeme of it.</NOTE> the word, ariseth from the glad tidings which it brings vnto them.

And now lest it might bee thought, that this was by any speciall priuiledge or dispensati|on of God toward him, from which others are excluded; he now declares that all who loue the law of God, may looke for the like comfort in it, which he had found. And this he sets downe in this proposition; speaking now, not in his owne person, as before, but in the person of others. Wherein we haue first to consider a description of Gods children; and next, the priuiledge or be|nefites belonging to them.</P>
<P>The description of the godly is heere, <HI>They</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Godly men many wayes described in holy Scripture, and why.</NOTE> <HI>that loue thy lawe.</HI> Many manner of wayes are the children of God described in holy Scripture; as, from their faith in God, from their loue, from their feare, from their obedience, from their pa|tience: to declare it is not one, but manifolde graces of the spirit, which concurre to make vp a Christian; and how they all goe together, like the linkes of a chaine, that one drawes on all the rest. His faith is not without loue: his loue is not without obedience: his obedience is not<NOTE PLACE="marg">&rindx;</NOTE> without feare: his feare is not without hope: his
<PB N="371" REF="193">
hope is not without patience: his patience is not without prayer; which keepes and conserues all the rest. And hereof it comes that the god|ly in holy Scripture are so many waies described.</P>
<P>But among all the graces of the Spirit, the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Yet are they most described by loue, for two causes.</NOTE> godly are most frequently described from their loue: and therefore of all other we should most take heed that the grace of loue be in vs; for two causes: first, because it leades vs to the surest knowledge of Gods affection toward our selues; and next, it giues vs the surest notice of that e|state, and disposition, wherein wee stand our selues.</P>
<P>As to the first, the grace of feruent and vn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ey|ned<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Loue in vs <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">des vs to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> know|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">dge of Gods <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ue to vs.</NOTE> loue, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> it be in vs, makes vs certainly to know that we are beloued of God. So saith the Apostle, <HI>Herein is loue; not that wee loued God first: but</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Ioh. 4.</NOTE> <HI>that he loued vs.</HI> If we know him, it is because we haue beene knowne of him. If a man vtter not<NOTE PLACE="marg">&lindx;</NOTE> his voyce, the Eccho makes him no answere: if he looke not into a glasse, it makes no representa|tion of his face: if the Lord had not called vs, we should neuer haue answered him: if he had not sought vs, wee should neuer haue sought him; neyther loued him, if first hee had not loued vs. Here then is the first benefire wee reape by this grace of loue; that by it we knowe the minde of<NOTE PLACE="marg">A great com|fort, to know that God is well minded toward vs.</NOTE> God toward vs to be full of loue. So that now we neede not goe vp to Gods secret counsell, to enquire what is his minde concerning vs: let vs
<PB N="372" REF="194">
enter into the secret of our owne hearts, and try there what is our affection toward him: if wee dare say that we loue him, then may we be out of all doubt that we are beloued of him.</P>
<P>The other benefit is, that by loue we know we<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. By loue in vs, we know we are in the state of grace.</NOTE> are in the state of grace, translated, as saith the A|postle, from death to life: then we begin to liue when we begin to loue our God. There may be in man a shadow of grace; a profession of faith &amp; o|bedience: but though a man had all knowledge and eloquence, wanting loue, he is but a sounding Cymbal. So that by this one grace, w^c^h the Apo|stle cals a most excellent grace, all other graces of the spirit will come to be tried. That faith which workes not by loue, is no faith: &amp; that obedience w^c^h flowes not from faith, is no obedience. Loue is the balance of the Sanctuary, wherein euery thing is weighed which is offered vnto God: let vs therefore couet this most excellent grace.</P>
<P>That this comfort may be made the more sure<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two things to trie if we haue loue or not.</NOTE> vnto vs, let vs consider these two infallible tokens of our loue: the first is, the loue of Gods law; the next is the loue of his Saints.</P>
<P>The law of God hath in it a certaine pourtrai|ture<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. He that loues God cannot but loue his law, fith it is a pourtrait of his image.</NOTE> of his image. What he is in himselfe, he hath declared in his lawe: &amp; therefore such as knowe him and loue him, cannot but loue his law. <HI>If any man loue me,</HI> said the Lord Iesus, <HI>he will keepe my commandements. Dauid</HI> ioynes these two to|gether in the 16. Psalme; hee protests that God
<PB N="373" REF="194">
was the portion of his inheritance: and againe in the III. verse of this Psalme, That he had ta|ken the Testimonies of God as an heritage for euer. Alas, that foolish man should think to dis|ioyne these two; pretending to loue God, when he shewes himselfe a plaine contemner of his word.</P>
<P>The other marke, whereby Gods loue is try|ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. He that loues God cannot but loue his Saints.</NOTE> is the loue of his Saints: <HI>By this shall yee bee knowne to be my Disciples, if yee loue one another. He that loueth not his brother whom he hath scene;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 13. 1.

<P><HI>Dauid</HI> many times hath protested that he lo|ued God dearely; but he proues it by this, That he loued the lawe of God, and the Saints of God: <HI>I am companion</HI> (said hee) <HI>to all them that feare thee,</HI> ver. 63.

<P>IN this conclusion of the Psalme, wee haue three things: a confession of sinne, a petition of mercy, and a protestation. The confessi|on, <HI>I haue wandred like a lost sheep: Euthymius</HI> &amp; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dauid persecu|ted with ba|nishment.</NOTE> <HI>Vatablus,</HI> vnderstand this to bee a complaint of his persecution he sustained of <HI>Saul;</HI> who like a rauening Wolfe of <HI>Beniamins</HI> tribe, chased <HI>Dauid</HI> like a poore sheepe, from his natiue soyle; hunting him to and fro, like a Partrige, through the mountaines of <HI>Israel:</HI> and that therefore, lea|ning to the testimonie of his good conscience, he makes bolde with GOD, that hee would re|duce him, and bring him home againe. And this exposition is also agreeable to the Analogie of faith.</P>
<P>But wee rather take this, with <HI>Basil</HI> and <HI>Am|brose,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">It is common to all men to wander from God.</NOTE> to be a petition for spiritual deliuerance fro~ his sinnes; wherein first, he premi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s a confession of his misery, that he had wandred from God&punc;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Basil</HI> in Psal. 119.</NOTE> <HI>Hoc et prophe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> a post peccatum, &amp; omni huma|nae naturae dicere conuenit:</HI> and this not on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">lie

the Prophet, but the whole nature of man after the transgression, is bound to confesse. <HI>Quod lap|sum</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ambrose,</HI> Psal. 119.</NOTE> <HI>fateris, in eo tibi cum omnibus commune con|sortium est; quia nemo sine peccato: negare hoc sacrilegium est; solus enim deus sine peccato est: confiteri hoc deo impunitatis remedium est:</HI> that<NOTE PLACE="marg">&lindx;</NOTE> thou confessest thy sin, in this thou hast a com|mon fellowship with all mankinde: there is no man without sinne; that is Gods prerogatiue: to deny this, is sacriledge: to confesse it, is the waie to impunity. <HI>Dic itaque et tu iniquitates tuas, vt iustificeris:</HI> Confesse thou therefore thy sins, that thou maist be iustified. It is the presumptu|ous voyce of Antichrist, That a man in this life can be without sinne, and fulfill the law in per|fection.</P>
<P>If their eies were opened to see either the Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Such as thinke themselues without sin are but blinde.</NOTE> or themselues, they would be farre fro~ this abho|minable presumption.

As the small motes of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">yre, <HI>Atomi,</HI> are onely seene where the sunne shi|neth: so the manifold imperfectio~s of our nature, are best seene, where the light of Gods word shines most cleerely.

in a man to see the humble confession of his sinnes. <HI>Scio enim, per infirmitatis verecundiam, grauioris esse certaminis praeterita peccata prodere, quam non admissa vitare.</HI> For I knowe, through the infirmitie of shame, that the godly haue a greater battel to confesse sinne committed, than to represse it that it be not committed.</P>
<P><HI>Seeke mee.</HI>] The second thing in the verse is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">God the great shepheard of his people.</NOTE> petition of mercy, after the confession of sinne; I haue wandred like a lost sheep: but thou who art the great pastor of thy sheepe, who causest ioie in heauen, at the conuersion of a sinner; thou that leauest ninetie and nine feeding in the moun|taines, to seeke one of thy sheepe that hath wan|dred from thee; Come thou Lord, and by thy grace, bring me home againe. <HI>Quaere me, quia te</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambros.</NOTE> <HI>requiro.</HI> Seeke mee, for by thy grace I seeke thee: <HI>Potes inuenire quem tu requiris,</HI> Thou maist finde<NOTE PLACE="marg">His <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> to|ward his wan|dring sheepe.</NOTE> him whom thou seekest. <HI>Dignare suscipere quem inueneris,</HI> Vouchsafe to receiue him whom thou hast found. <HI>Impone humeris quem susceperis,</HI> And lay him vpon thy shoulders, whom thou hast re|ceiued. <HI>Non est tibi piu~ onus fastidio,</HI> It is no wea|risom burden to thee, to beare thine owne, and bring them home againe vnto thy selfe.</P>
<P>Thus we see, how not onely in our first con|uersion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The praise of the beginning, progresse, and perfection of our saluation is dew to God onely.</NOTE> God did communicate life to vs when wee were dead; as he followed Apostate <HI>Adam,</HI> that ranne away from him, and brought him a|gain: but in all the course of our life, he is the con|seruer

and restorer of life to our soules. No man can reckon the errours of his life. We should pe|rish in the least of them, if the mercy of God did not watch ouer vs; to saue vs when we haue lost our selues; to reduce vs when we wander; to raise vs when we fall. So that the whole praise of the beginning, continuance, and consummation of our saluation, belongs to the Lord our GOD onely.</P>
<P><HI>For I forget not thy commandements.</HI>] The<NOTE PLACE="marg">The godly ne|uer so fall that they lose all grace.</NOTE> third and last thing in the verse, is this protestati|on. Where if it be demaunded, How do these a|gree with the former? He hath euen now said that he wandred like a lost sheep; &amp; now he saith, that he forgets not the co~mandements of God: The answere is, The godly neuer so fall, but there re|maines in them some grace, <HI>quae spem medicinae</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambr.</NOTE> <HI>reseruat,</HI> which reserues a hope of medicine to cure them: so <HI>Dauid</HI> here, <HI>Lic&egrave;t quaedam manda|torum dei transgressus est, omnimodam tamen il|lorum obliuionem non admisit.</HI> Albeit hee trans|gressed some of Gods commandements, yet hee fell not into any full obliuion of them.</P>
<P>And last, we see here, that as <HI>Dauid</HI> first got life<NOTE PLACE="marg">The manifolde vses of Gods word to the godly.</NOTE> to his soule by the word; so by it life was conser|ued vnto him: and if at any time hee fell, it was the word that wakened him, to turne againe to the Lord by repentance.

how to cure it. And as the crowing of the Cock wakened <HI>Peter,</HI> to mourne for the deniall of Christ: so the warning of the word, wakens vs to repent when we haue sinned.</P>
