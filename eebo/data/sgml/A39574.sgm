</LIST>
<P>For the Truths sake, which now lies at stake openly between you two, and them, I am minded, as moved in way of <HI>Reply,</HI> to say something to both your Books, and to your selves, and the world also about them. I intend not a <HI>total Translation</HI> of that forraign Language, wherein that foresaid <HI>Latine</HI> part of thine <HI>I. O.</HI> in which thou fight st most fiercely with thy fore-nam'd Friends, was written (so much of that shall serve, as will serve the turn of such <HI>Truths</HI> as I h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve plead against thee in the service of) nor a <HI>total transcription</HI> of either of your books (they are not worth it) not yet an Answer to every falsity that is found therein (<HI>Hoc opus, luc labor est,</HI> they are more then my measure of <HI>Arithmetick</HI> can easily reach to reckon up) But a due <HI>Expostulation</HI> with you both, on the <HI>Quakers</HI> and the <HI>Truths</HI> behalf; an <HI>Animadversion</HI> of some at least of those many absolute absurdities, follies, confusions, false doctrines, flat contradictions to your|selves, which are eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and anon therein uttered by you; a <HI>Subversion</HI> of your <HI>Topsie-Turvies,</HI> who set the chief things ye have to do, withall <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|chi-podialiter</HI> (as it were) with the heels upwards; a <HI>Blowing</HI> away of those <HI>blasphemies, lies, calumnies, opprobrious titles, disdainful subsannations, unjust accusations, spiteful aspersions, abominable abuses</HI> breat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d out by you against the people abovesaid, whom, all that curse, shall once see and say, are a Seed, whom God hath blessed; and (to be short) an <HI>Examination</HI> of many such matters in every part of both your Books, how
<PB REF="28">
scamblingly soever they lye, here some, and there some in them, as I find bear any reference to the <HI>Qua.</HI> or to those Doctrines, <HI>viz.</HI> 1 Of <HI>Iustifi|cation</HI> by the Righteousness of <HI>Christ</HI> in us: 2 Of the <HI>Letters</HI> not being the only <HI>Foundation</HI> and <HI>Rule</HI> of <HI>Faith</HI> and holy life: 3 Of the <HI>Infallible Spirits Inspiration,</HI> and <HI>Infallible</HI> direction of his Ministry at this day: 4 Of the <HI>V|niversal</HI> love and grace of God to all men: 5 Of the <HI>True saving Light</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> enlightning every man in the world: 6 Of the <HI>Attainableness</HI> of perfect purity, or freedome from sin in this life, in each of which ye dif|fer from them, and which against you both, and your Adherents, are held forth by them.</P>
<P>Sundry false and grosly absurd businesses against the Light, and its Chil|dren, may not improbably be briefly noted, as they lye most notably ob|vious to every common capacity, in the nine Sermons of <HI>Iohn Tombs, B.D.</HI> which came piping hot from the Press, while this of mine to you two, is coming to it, put out by <HI>R. Baxter</HI>; which pair of blind Brethren, as much enmity, threatning, and Thunder without Lightning, as hath been between them hitherto against each other, are it seems, like <HI>Herod</HI> and <HI>Pilate,</HI> now made friends together against <HI>Christs</HI> Light, so as to make one Head, though two Horns, wherewith to thrust it down if they could, for which a Rod, a Rod in the Lords hand, is already ready for the back of <HI>Baxter,</HI> who, and his once Heretical and Heterodox, but now Reverend and Orthodox Brother <HI>Tombs,</HI> as two Twins that tumbled both out of one Belly, even one and the same Womb of that <HI>Babylonish Bawd,</HI> are both to be tumbled into one and the same <HI>Tomb,</HI> or Grave, that (as your two <HI>I. O. T. D.</HI>) so their pair of pratings may go together into the earth, whence they came, as like to like, earth to earth, ashes to ashes, for dust, which is the <HI>Serpents</HI> meat, all your Divinity doings are, and unto dust must they all return.</P>
<P>Now as little method as thy Book <HI>I. O.</HI> hath in it, yet is it as capable to be divided into parts, as it is in each part, in one thing or another, most palpably divided against it self.</P>
<P N="1">1 As to the subject matter thereof, it is in general twofold, (<HI>viz.</HI>) The <HI>Outward Letter,</HI> and the <HI>Inward Light</HI>; that External writing, or legible form of words, commonly called the <HI>Scripture,</HI> the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> which are <HI>(ad extra,</HI> but <HI>ab intra)</HI> only and meerly without, though from with|in; together with that Internal Law, Spirit, Power, or Word, which is <HI>(ad intra)</HI> by all that know the Truth, as it is in <HI>Iesus,</HI> both seen, felt, heard, understood, and witnessed to be within, not more cryed up by the men call'd <HI>Quakers,</HI> who live both according to it, and the <HI>Scri|pture,</HI> then decryed by the men that are but supposed to be <HI>Christs Mini|sters,</HI> who are utterly erring besides them both, knowing truly neither the one, nor yet the other.</P>
<P>Sund<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y touches there are given by thee, as thou goest along, at other things; (<HI>viz.) Vniversal Grace, Perfection, Persecution, Modern Inspiration by the Spirit of God, Revelation,</HI> and such like, about which thine and the <HI>Quakers</HI> Doctrine differs, by which (as <HI>ex pede Herculem</HI>) thy Pulse is felt, and it's spied out how thy Spirit blows against Christs; thy truthless talk, of which may (the <HI>Lord</HI> leading to it) not unlikely be talked with
<PB REF="28">
by the way, before I have done: But those two abovesaid, being well nigh the <HI>Totum in Toto,</HI> &amp; the <HI>Totum in qualibet parte,</HI> the matters thou mainly medlest with, and most miserably mudlest thy self about, thoroughout the whole Body of thy Book, and every part thereof, making little less then a very God of the one, <HI>i. e.</HI> Of the <HI>Letter,</HI> which is the last and the least, and the lowest of the two; and little better then a very Devil of the other, <HI>i. e.</HI> the <HI>Light,</HI> which is the first, and the highest, and the greatest; so that all others are but toucht upon, as in subserviency either to the Deifying, or defying (respectively) of one of these, to clear away that fog and smoak which thou raisest about them, both to the thickning and dark|ning of the Sun and Ayr, so that none can see either of them clearly, through thy cloudy collation thereupon, is the chief intent, and likely to be the chief and utmost extent of this present Answer.</P>
<P N="2">2 As to the Tongue wherein it treats, (excepting here and there a lit|tle <HI>Hebrew,</HI> and (for shew sometimes more then service) a penful or two of <HI>Greek</HI> interlin'd in both parts, and now and then two or three licks of <HI>Latine</HI> among the <HI>English</HI>) thy Book stands divided into two parts, (<HI>viz.) Latine,</HI> and <HI>English</HI> (a Cloven Tongue of another nature then those that sate upon the <HI>Apostles</HI>) and these are as the two <HI>Horns</HI> of that second dou|ble-fac'd <HI>Beast,</HI> that is as the <HI>Lamb,</HI> and yet speaks like the <HI>Dragon,</HI> where|with thou pushest at thy Opposers on the right hand, as well as on the left, even not only at thy own Brethren, the <HI>Protestant Divines,</HI> when they please thee not by <HI>Divining</HI> the contrary to thy peremptory peculiar Positions, and preheminent pratings, together with that blind Brood of the first ten-horn'd <HI>Beast of Rome,</HI> to whom both thou and all thy <HI>Brethren</HI> (though in many things ye justly band against them) are <HI>Brothers</HI> in na|ture still, and of neerer Kin then ye well <HI>ken</HI> or <HI>wot</HI> of, but also against the true <HI>People of God.</HI></P>
<P>These two general parts (each of which is prefaced with an <HI>Epistle</HI> al|so in language like it self) stand <HI>divided</HI> and <HI>subdivided</HI> more particularly within themselves, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the <HI>English</HI> into two <HI>Treatises,</HI> which <HI>subdivide</HI> themselves, the one into six <HI>Chapters,</HI> the other (though falsly figured) in|to eight, the <HI>Latine</HI> into four <HI>Apologetical Exercitations</HI> (as thou call'st them) for the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> against (as thou call'st the <HI>Quakers</HI>) the <HI>Fanatical Ones</HI> of these Times.</P>
<P>Which fore-named <HI>divisions</HI> and <HI>subdivisions,</HI> that are scarcely more di|vided from then against each other, do all split themselves yet fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ther in|to a new needless number of smaller <HI>Sections</HI> and <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ses.</HI></P>
<P>The two <HI>English</HI> Treatises which arise mostly from one and the same Spring or Head, together with the other (not <HI>God,</HI> nor his <HI>Spirit,</HI> nor yet the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> but the Head of the <HI>Serpent</HI> which is to be bruised, thy own brain, vain invention, and imagination) run along treating to and fro in two distinct streams, or Torrents awhile, and at last, having (as thou sayst) <HI>Arctissimum materiae &amp; doctrine consortium,</HI> a neer coincidence of their matter with it, and affinity in their subject, by which the whole Trinity of them is drawn into that Unity to compleat thy double Doctrine (far) from the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> for the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> fall into one with the <HI>Latine Sourse,</HI> or <HI>Lake of Lyes,</HI> that burns more hotly then the rest in wrath a|gainst the <HI>Quakers.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="29">And having there lodg'd and center'd thy two <HI>English</HI> Discourses, and drawn them into one with this, (verifying herein that old true saying, <HI>Vis unita fortior</HI>) thou ventest that venome in stronger streams, and spit|test out that spite more fluently, and in fuller floods against the <HI>Qua.</HI> which was in some few places only sprinkled out upon them before, and filling up what was behind of thy flattering false Applauses of the naked <HI>Letter,</HI> which with some of the same that were used before, and some new <HI>super-eminent</HI> undue Titles thou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> here also magnifiest, beyond the bounds and measure of all modesty and truth, hoping belike to appear approved of <HI>Christ,</HI> as one of note in his service, (what disservice soe|ver thou do him otherwise) so long as thou art found saying something (though <HI>Hoc aliquid nihil est,</HI> as good thou hadst said just nothing as no more to the purpose) and raking, and skimming, and scraping out of thy own thoughts some ample <HI>Apologies</HI> for the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> thou fillest up thy measure of mad mirth against that true inward Light of <HI>God,</HI> and its Children, that testifie unto it, as that which is to be preferred before the <HI>Letter,</HI> and was before it, as that which the <HI>Letter</HI> was given forth from, despising these, as in thy <HI>English Epistle,</HI> p. 28. p. 30. under the (as false as foul) terms of poor deluded <HI>Fanatical Qua.</HI> pretending to be guided by an <HI>Infallible Spirit,</HI> that oppose the whole truth about the Word of God, so there under the abusive clamours against, and charges of them (even by whole-sale) as <HI>Fanatical ones,</HI> that are notoriously known by their errours and foolishness, who are driven by the power of an Evil <HI>Spirit,</HI> &amp; depressing the <HI>Light</HI> (which is the Name of <HI>Christ</HI> exalted above all Names) without any colour of light, or tolerable evidence of <HI>Scripture,</HI> or Reason, that it is by ten thousand degrees so bad a business as thou makest of it, into so low a condition, as wherein to stand in need (so far as a thing that needs no such thing, but infallibly evidenceth its own Innocency and Excellency, may be said to need it) of such <HI>Apology,</HI> as at the end of this work thou wilt find me making for it, and so as to put it under every name that is named, not only of things in Heaven, or per|taining any way to the Kingdome thereof, but of things in earth too; and (if <HI>ens</HI> be better then <HI>non ens,</HI> as ye count it, and a being, though a bad one, be better then none at all) under things that are under the earth also, setting it at naught, so as to render it worse then naught, till (what in thee is) thou quite annihilatest, and mak'st just <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ought or no|thing of it at all: Having made unto thy self a Graven Image, and Golden <HI>God,</HI> of that meer Image thou hast by thee, of the old Original Copies of the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> in thy frothy, vain, light, and yet dark and lightless mind, thou dost, <HI>Hos omnes naso suspendere adunco,</HI> ironically fall a scoffing at the <HI>Qua.</HI> and the true Light of the true <HI>God,</HI> and consequently at the true <HI>God</HI> from whom it comes, puffing at it, as if thou wouldst puff it out at a blast, making thy self merry over it among thy <HI>Academical Admirers,</HI> laughing both it, and all that own it, and so him that gives it out, even to very scorn, terming it, (as if thou knewst not what to call it that is bad enough for it) <HI>I know not what Light, that hath no community or correspondency with the</HI> Scriptures, and (jeeringly) <HI>the Infa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lible D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r, that counterfeited Light, or Word within, the feigned Imaginary</HI> Christ, <HI>I know

<P>Thus when thou hast made thy self sport enough with vilifying the Light of <HI>Christ,</HI> and <HI>Christ,</HI> who is the Light, thou art pleased to end thy Play with a nullifying of it, and so <HI>de nihilo nihilum, nihil in nil, &amp;c.</HI> out of this nothing there can come nothing; and thou having done thy do with it, hopest to hear no more of it, away it must without more ado, having nothing to do, <HI>in rerum natura,</HI> but to make <HI>I. O.</HI> merry a while, and at his will to become nothing again. But <HI>I. O.</HI>
<Q><L>&mdash;Hoc ego opertum,</L>
<L>Hoc Ridere meum(tam nil)nulla tibi vendo</L>
<L>Scriptura vel inane tua quacun&abque; vel ipsa.</L></Q></P>
<P>As very nothing as this Light of <HI>Christ,</HI> and Word within is with thee and thine, whose thin somethings, and empty every things, in which you yet bless your selves, are wearing out; and mouldring to no|thing, yet such as know the true worth thereof, will not so undervalue it, as to sell it for any of thy vain <HI>Scripture</HI> for the <HI>Scripture,</HI> nor for the best of that best <HI>Scripture,</HI> which thy vain <HI>Scripture</HI> for it prefers before it, which <HI>Scripture</HI> yet, as to its own proper place and use, they are far be|fore thy self in preferring.</P>
<P>And howbeit, thou deemest that the Light thou so damn'st down to no|thing, hath done with thee, thou having thus done with it, and done it away as far from thee, as a man of thy Cloth can likely fling it; yet there is an hour thou art not ware of, wherein thy self and it must meet again, in which it will find thee out for all thy floutings of it, and come nigh to thee to Judgement, as a swift Witness against thee, for more things then that, which thou hast forgotten, and set all that thou hast done in thy vile body in remembrance, and in order before thee; and unless thou repent thee in the time, wherein in the goodness of God its given men to lead them to repentance, damn thee for ever, far further from any sight (as to enjoyment) of it self and God, then ever thou by all thy Judgement past against it, canst condemn it from thy self, or possibly judge it out of thy sight.</P>
<P>As for thy <HI>pair of Pamphlets, T.D.</HI> they consist more particularly as follows; <HI>viz.</HI> The first (which, besides its piece of Preface, is a meer five|fold fiction) of a treble Tale, untrue Relation, or cursory, crooked, crude, and decrepid Account of the Three Disputations, that were held at <HI>Sand|wich,</HI> on the twelf, thirteenth, nineteenth daies of the second Moneth, 1659. between thy self, and three of us called <HI>Quakers,</HI> viz. <HI>R. Hubber|thorn, G. Whitehead,</HI> and my self; together with a short Answer, as (to the saving me that labour, who should else have so entitled it) thy self most truly superscribedst it, p. 34. (for indeed thy <HI>Devils Bow</HI> shoots too
<PB REF="30">
short, either to hit the mark thou shootest at, or hurt that innocent Lamb|like Spirit, that speaks in that, or any other, of <HI>R. H.</HI> his writings) to a trifling <HI>Pamphlet</HI> put forth by <HI>R. H.</HI> as thou triflingly termst it: And lastly, <HI>A brief Narrative</HI> (so thou nam'st that last and most Remarkable part thereof) <HI>of some Remarkable Passages.</HI></P>
<P>The second, which, besides thy <HI>Epistle</HI> and <HI>Preface,</HI> is but as it were a lesser Chump of the same old Wooden Block with the other, subdividing and cleaving it self out also into five smaller chips, fit for little else but fewel for the same fire, by which (as by the day that now declares the Workman, and his Work, of what sort it is) they are all to be both re|vealed, consumed, and burnt up, among the rest of those bryars and thorns that are setting themselves to battel against the <HI>Lord,</HI> and of those buildings of wood, hay and stubble, which the Scornets of the Corner|stone are erecting to their own ruine; <HI>viz.</HI> a kind of <HI>Epitomical</HI> repetition of what was shufflingly said by thy self in thy first Tritie, concerning the four Heads, or rather and indeed against these four points of Doctrine, <HI>viz.</HI> 1 <HI>The Light of Christ.</HI> 2 <HI>Perfection.</HI> 3 <HI>Iustification.</HI> 4 <HI>The Scriptures</HI>; with frequent references to thy (so call'd) <HI>Qua.</HI> folly, for the rest of thy <HI>Replyes</HI> to us, who had replied to them all ore and ore again before.</P>
<P>And lastly, another <HI>Narrative</HI>; (not so call'd by thee) yet for the lies and naughtiness thereof, and nothing else, much more Remarkable then the former, as will be seen in my <HI>Animadversion</HI> of it.</P>
<P>Having said this little to you both, <HI>I.O.</HI> and <HI>T. D.</HI> about your Books, by way of <HI>Preface,</HI> or Dedication, of what hereafter follows, to your selves, and all your Followers and Fellow-Labourers in the like lame cause, who belabouring your selves in talk about the <HI>Letter</HI> against the <HI>Light,</HI> live and walk more by the <HI>false fire,</HI> and <HI>twinkling flash</HI> of your own <HI>thred-bare thoughts</HI> and <HI>infatuated imaginations,</HI> then either by the <HI>Letter,</HI> or the <HI>Light.</HI> I come now <GAP DESC="foreign"> without much Preamble, or more ado, <HI>ad rem substratam,</HI> to the businesse and work it self, as it lies before me.</P>
<P>And howbeit, I shall not regard any <HI>External form, order,</HI> or <HI>methodical manner</HI> of proceeding with you, so much as <HI>words</HI> and <HI>matter</HI> of <HI>profit</HI> and <HI>truth</HI> it self, yet as there is a <HI>Quaternity</HI> of you, or rather a <HI>Fraternity</HI> of four angry <HI>Fighters</HI> or <HI>Quarrellers</HI> with the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and the <HI>truths</HI> told by them, <HI>viz. I. O. T. D. I. T. R. Baxter,</HI> all whom, first or last, one where or other, more or lesse, I shall have to do with: So (though not there|fore) I shall divide my ensuing undertakings against you, in the Name and Power of God on their behalf, in such wise, as thou <HI>I. O.</HI> dost thy <HI>Doctor|like</HI> Divinity Disputations, or <HI>Latine-labours</HI> against them, <HI>viz.</HI> into four <HI>Apologetical Exercitations,</HI> or <HI>Earnest Expostulations</HI> with you.</P>
<P>The first whereof is to be more down-rightly directed to thee <HI>T.D.</HI> (the rest, who are of the same misty mind with thee, not excluded) in way of <HI>Examination</HI> of that <HI>Legend</HI> of <HI>Lyes,</HI> which thou, like some great <HI>Benefactor</HI> to it, bestowest on the <HI>Clergies Cause,</HI> against the <HI>Truth,</HI> and its Children; and as concerning the point of <HI>Iustification</HI> in special, which thou makest thy self a main Mannager of against us for all the rest, who say little of it, and in which thou, by thy lies about it, in both Do|ctrine
<PB REF="30">
and matter of fact, most basely abusest both thy self, and the <HI>Truth,</HI> and my self in particular, and all the <HI>Qua.</HI> in general also.</P>

<P>My Entrance shall be at thy <HI>Epistles,</HI> in the first of which thou <HI>T.D.</HI> sayest, <HI>Perhaps the Reader will wonder that thou shouldst meddle with such a Generation as the</HI> Quakers, <HI>and think thy time hangs on the lug, and will not off at any considerable rate.</HI></P>

<P>And as for the third slanderous accusation: the Minister of <HI>Cavehold,</HI> which the Author of this scandalous Book calls a very reverend man, we whose names are here under mentioned, did go unto this Minister of <HI>Cavehold</HI> in <HI>Sussex</HI> the 16th day of this eleventh month. 59.

<P>For mark how matter of Accusation it self is made by our Priests of our having been at <HI>Rome,</HI> and declaring there against Popery, and under that Protection, we went out in, returning safe again into <HI>England,</HI> which is now laid to me as a Crime, witness thy words, (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>

<P>There is little posting to preach abroad by these <HI>fixed Stars,</HI> the stand stiff like <HI>Posts</HI> in their own places: let those <HI>wandring Stars</HI> say they (not considering that the <HI>Vagabonds</HI> and <HI>wandring Stars to whom the mist of dark|ness is reserved for ever,</HI> are such <HI>as wander with</HI> Cain <HI>from the light of God,</HI> and not to and fro to preach the <HI>Gospel</HI>) let the <HI>Qua.</HI> gad about and <HI>gang to Rome,</HI> or where they will, wee'l be none of their <HI>gang</HI>; and as for money there's little need for them to Run so far as <HI>Rome</HI> for pay, to re|ceive his <HI>pensions</HI> from the Pope himself, having it nearer home.</P>

<P>But since I have taken on me to take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o much notice of it, let's examine what to the utmost can be made thereof; which is just nothing at all to|wards <HI>T.

so to Argue against it, were deluded from believing that Truth concern|ing Christ (<HI>viz</HI>) that he arose from the dead.</P>
<P>Oh <HI>how Wonderfully Michievous are misreports</HI> unto the Truth, when men, who receive not the love of it, that they may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aved, are given over of God to give heed to them, <HI>that they may be damned, because they take pleasure in unrighteousness, and have no pleasure in the Truth</HI>?</P>
<P>His Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ciples say they came and stole him away while we slept, here is the fictitious and forcible Antecedent, therefore he arose not from the dead, here is the crooked conclusion, which that other was so cogent to make the people close with in their Consciences, and take for Truth.</P>
<P><HI>Piteous Premis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI> plain enough to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">een by men, whose eyes were not out, to be meerly forged and of little force;</P>
<P>For if they were awake, and on their watch, as 'twas fit for a Court of Guard to be, they might have rescued him from his Disciple, that were unarmed men, but if they were asleep, as they say they were, is the Te|stimony of those men fit to be entertaind for Truth, or of force among any but such infatuated fancies, as every <HI>ignis fatuus</HI> befooles into a follow|ing of it self, wheresoever it goes before them, that stand up to beare wit|ness of what was done while they were asleep? yet how strongly and strangely did this filly shift work upon the misbeleiving faculty of that foolish Nation, to the finall falsifying of their Faith, in so high an Ar|ticle of it? insomuch that as that Saying is commonly Reported, so that <HI>Article</HI> of Christs <HI>Resurrection</HI> is thereupon not beleived to this day, <HI>said the Evangelists</HI> 16 hundred years ago, and say I, who have been an <HI>Eare Witness</HI> of the same, to this very day, wherein we live.</P>
<P>The like effectual operation upon the <HI>prejudicate opinions</HI> and <HI>Imaginati|ons</HI> of such people, to whom there is <HI>deceptio visus,</HI> and in whose <HI>visible faculty</HI> there's a deep defect through their living in the Night, and not loving the Light, hath <HI>T.

<P><HI>S. F.</HI> Quoth he, <HI>hath no visible Estate, hath Bills of Exchange to take up 400 l. if he will,</HI> had to and from <HI>Constantinople to Rome Bills of Exchange to take up money there.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore 'tis probably as true that he there receiv'd a Pension from the Pope.</P>
<P>His Tripartite Antecedent is as <HI>false,</HI> as the <HI>Popes Tripple Crown is foolish,</HI> but suppose it were all as <HI>True,</HI> as 'tis <HI>false,</HI> I know no hurt in it, if it were, for such as Travail, whether to <HI>Rome,</HI> or elsewhere, to have <HI>Bills</HI> to take up money if they need it; and what I had, or where, or from whence, or from whom, let him that lyes go look, yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ile tell the truth to him so farr at least, as will tell his Tale to be a <HI>Lye</HI>; I had none to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> nor from thence to <HI>Rome,</HI> neither Received I any money by any Bill at <HI>Rome,</HI> much less any <HI>Pension</HI> from the <HI>Pope,</HI> which is that he makes the consequent of the other; so that <HI>T.

<PB N="59" REF="64">
argued thus <HI>ad Contrarium (viz.)</HI> He went with coals from <HI>New-Castle to London,</HI> therefore 'tis very probable he went not to <HI>London</HI> to fetch or to get any there.</P>
<P>He carried great Bills with him to <HI>Rome,</HI> to take up mony there, there|fore 'tis utterly unlikely that he had any <HI>Pension</HI> of his own to Receive there from the Pope, for then he might have sav'd his labour in the other.</P>
<P>For verily it had been as silly and superfluous for me to have <HI>Merchants Bills</HI> to take up mony by at <HI>Rome,</HI> had I had a <HI>Pension</HI> to Receive there from the <HI>Pope</HI> as 'tis (as the Proverb is) to <HI>carry coals to New-Castle,</HI> which what fool doth, may carry them home again, when he hath done.</P>
<P>So then this Text of <HI>T.D's</HI> Triviall Talk, as threefold a Cord, as it may seem to him, that is not quickly broken, is indeed, though strong enough to conclude the clean contrary way, yet, as to his purpose, but a three|fold thread of Toe so ill spun, that it fails like flax, when it feels the fire.</P>
<P>Nevertheless Note one Point of Doctrine more, before I quit it, that arises from it more against, then for <HI>T.

<P><HI>T.

Namely that I affirm'd [<HI>Good works justifie</HI>] and beleive that to be a <HI>lye,</HI> which <HI>T.D.</HI> sayes, p. 14. Name|ly, that I affirm'd [OUR <HI>good works justifie</HI>] for, <HI>T.D. alone,</HI> on his own head only, sayes this last, but <HI>T.D.</HI> together with his 5. <HI>Witnesses</HI> assert the other.</P>
<P>Thus then stands this case between me and thy selfe, <HI>T.D.</HI> thou ar|raignest me openly at the Bar before the world, p. 14. as a <HI>ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k Papist,</HI> as saying in these Termes that [OUR <HI>good works</HI>] <HI>are the meritorious</HI> cause of our justification, to which Inditement, I pleading not guilty of saying [<HI>OVR good works</HI> [but [<HI>good works</HI>] are the cause, &amp;c. How wilt thou be tryed (quoth the <HI>impartiall Iudge</HI> the <HI>honest hearted Reader,</HI> that would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ain find out the truth in the Court of his own conscience) whether thou be guilty of affirming and disputing the said position <HI>expressely in those Termes,</HI> or not guilty? I reply by <HI>God and the Country</HI>: What evidence bringst thou in (quoth the righteous Reader to <HI>T.D.</HI>) against <HI>S.F.</HI> whom thou so accusest? What were the Termes in which he and the <HI>Qua.</HI> ex|pressely affirm'd it? The Termes of the Question were these (quoth <HI>T.D.</HI> p. 58.) whether <HI>Good Workes he the meritoricus cause of our justification,</HI> which was <HI>expressely</HI> affirmed by them.</P>
<P>Thus am I cleared in the sight of God and all men from <HI>T.D's.

I. Boys, N. Barry, T. Seyliard, C. Nicols</HI> agree in their witnesse with him, and for ought I find as he sayes p. 58. So they say all; and he that will not beleive them, doth, what in him lyes, make them to be <HI>lyars</HI> like him, as well as <HI>T.D.</HI> in gain-saing p. 14. that truth. which himselfe and they with him do all assert p. 58. does not only make himselfe a <HI>lyar,</HI> but also, what in him <HI>lyes,</HI> abuse, not only me and himselfe, but all them also, so as to make them seem <HI>lyars</HI> also together with him.</P>
<P>Now then <HI>T.

<P>Henceforth therefore <HI>T.D.</HI> take heed of lying at all to thy own hurt; or if for want of love to it, thou must needs bely the Truth and its Children, for which <HI>wo,</HI> and no lesse then the <HI>Lake</HI> must be thy Portion, yet for thy credits sake a while have a care another time of lying so directly against thy <HI>self</HI>; but remember that <HI>Opo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mendacem esse memorem,</HI> it behoves a lyar to have his wits better about him, then thou had'st in this busines, least by going about to wrong another a great deal, he do not only in <HI>foro Dei,</HI> but <HI>hominum</HI> also, before men wrong himself not a little; as thou hast done, who at this time was<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t not thy <HI>Crafts-Master,</HI> so much as thy <HI>Craft</HI> was thine, to catch thee in the <HI>Snare,</HI> which thou laid'st, and to pull thee into the <HI>pit,</HI> and draw thee down into the <HI>ditch,</HI> which thyself digg'dst for another; for

<P>That then I affirmed <HI>good works</HI> to deserve <HI>Iustification,</HI> I own, and still affirm the same; but I deny that, that I there affirmed, and here I affirm that I then did and still do deny the <HI>Papist best works,</HI> which are not good, what ere they call them, to deserve <HI>Iustification,</HI> or OUR own <HI>best works</HI> either, who know no <HI>good works,</HI> that we have, but what Christ, who works no <HI>evil works,</HI> by his power worketh in, and by us, which, as they are done by him in us, are not ours but distinctive|ly from ours 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.7. <HI>Tit.</HI> 3.5. called his, and as they are done by <HI>us,</HI> throw his power in <HI>us,</HI> are called <HI>our works, Isa.</HI> 26.12. for as he doth them in us <HI>Mat.</HI> 10.20. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.3. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14.25. and work|eth in <HI>us,</HI> both to will and do them, they are truly <HI>his,</HI> and as we work them in and by that power he gives, may (yet not in such sense as what we do of <HI>our selves</HI>) be called our own <HI>Phil.</HI> 2.12.13. yea if we speak of what <HI>good works</HI> Christ did in that person only, in which he appeared at <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> while we witnesse not the same done by him in <HI>our selves,</HI> we cannot call those works OURS, to <HI>justification</HI> more truly then <HI>Papists</HI> can, who beleive as well as <HI>Protestants</HI> what he there did, though they never look to do the like:</P>
<P>&mdash; <HI>Quae non fecimus ipsi, non ea nostra voco.</HI></P>
<P>What he did in that <HI>person,</HI> and not <HI>OVRS,</HI> is his only yet, and not <HI>OVRS,</HI> but if we speak of what <HI>we</HI> do not only in our <HI>own per|sons,</HI> but our <HI>own wills, power and wisdom,</HI> abstract from him, and the leadings of his <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Spirit,</HI> I say <HI>Quae sic fecimus ipsi, haec ego nostra voco,</HI> these I call truly and only <HI>OVRS,</HI> and so doth the <HI>Scripture</HI> Rom. 10.3.4. Phil. 3.9. and as for what <HI>OVR persons</HI> do in his <HI>light</HI> accor|ding to his <HI>will,</HI> in the true movings of his <HI>Spirit,</HI> and by no other but his <HI>own Power, Quae nos fecimus ipsi sic, ea nostra voco,</HI> these, being <HI>partly ours,</HI> though <HI>principally his,</HI> I have a liberty from the Lord truly enough to denominate by that name of <HI>OVRS,</HI> yet as 'tis fit he should have the <HI>perheminence,</HI> as to the name, who is not the cheif <HI>Actor,</HI> but the only <HI>Author</HI> of them, I rather chuse mostly to call them <HI>His,</HI> though done in and <HI>by us,</HI> and so again,

<L>Quae nos fecimus ipsi, vix ea nostra voco.</L></Q></P>
<P>So there are 1. <HI>good work</HI>; which are only <HI>Christs,</HI> and not <HI>OVRS,</HI> and and by these he <HI>deservedly</HI> stood <HI>justified</HI> in the sight of God, in his <HI>own person,</HI> which if he had not done (and had he sinned he could not have done) he could never have bin a <HI>high Priest</HI> able to <HI>justify</HI> others, or sufficient to save to the uttermost, such as come to God by him; for such a <HI>high Priest</HI> it became us to have, who is <HI>holy, harmless, undefiled,</HI> and <HI>seperate from sinners</HI> himself, or else he could never <HI>seperate sin</HI> from <HI>us, Heb.</HI> 7.26.27.28.</P>
<P N="2">2. Again their are <HI>good works</HI> (so called) which are only <HI>OVRS,</HI> and not <HI>Christs,</HI> and such are all the best that we work <HI>without him of our selves,</HI> even all our <HI>own Righteousnesse</HI> and <HI>Righteousnesses,</HI> which are as an <HI>unclean thing,</HI> as a <HI>menstru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">us Rag, Isa.</HI> 64.6. as <HI>dung and losse and not gain,</HI> nor any way profitable to save or deliver, <HI>Isa.</HI> 57.12.13. <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.4.10.10. And by these though done in mans <HI>willings,</HI> and <HI>run|nings,</HI> in a way of outward conformity to the <HI>letter of the Law shall</HI> no flesh ever be <HI>justified</HI> any more then <HI>Paul was,</HI> for these are not Christs (all whose works are <HI>meritorious,</HI> and <HI>acceptable</HI> to God, and <HI>deserving no Condemnation</HI> that I know of, and consequently deserving <HI>iustification</HI> before God; but mans <HI>own Righteousnesse,</HI> as that of the <HI>Iewes</HI> was, <HI>Rom.</HI> 9, 32.10.3.2.3. and <HI>Pauls</HI> was, till he came to the <HI>Light</HI> (though for want of coming to the <HI>Light,</HI> T.D. in his dark minde saith <HI>Paul</HI> had no righteousnesse that was not Christs p, 22.) is <HI>meritorious</HI> of no more acceptance then <HI>Cains Sacrifice</HI> had, which was <HI>iustly</HI> and <HI>deservedly</HI> rejected, because its the <HI>evill doer</HI> still, that <HI>does that good,</HI> which <HI>God</HI> (what ere the sinner calls it) accounteth <HI>evill.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Again there are <HI>good works</HI> which in different respects are called (truly enough) both <HI>Christs,</HI> and <HI>OVRS (viz.) OVRS,</HI> as done in and by <HI>Our</HI> persons, <HI>Christs,</HI> as done only by <HI>his</HI> power in us, and by these last (call them, as ye will) <HI>Christs,</HI> as done by him in <HI>OVR persons,</HI> or <HI>OVRS,</HI> as done by us in <HI>his power,</HI> is the <HI>justification</HI> of all, that ever were or shall be <HI>justified,</HI> both <HI>deserved</HI> and <HI>effected,</HI> and not by what he did with|out <HI>them</HI> in that <HI>single person</HI> that once liv'd and dyed at <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> while the <HI>same righteousnesse</HI> was and is not by that <HI>same power</HI> of his fulfill|ed <HI>within</HI> themselves; and so 1 <HI>st.</HI> detesting all that as <HI>Rotten Rags,</HI> thats done by <HI>meer man without Christ,</HI> and <HI>disowning</HI> it utterly, as giving no influence to <HI>mans justification,</HI> both honouring and duly <HI>owning</HI> all that <HI>righteousnesse,</HI> that was wrought by <HI>Christ without</HI> man, as <HI>perfect, pretious, glorious, accept|able</HI> to <HI>God, unspeakably</HI> usefull to us, and truly <HI>meritorious</HI> at least to his own justification, that he might become (as el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e he could not) a <HI>meet Mediatour</HI> for man, this 3d. and last I <HI>own</HI> only as the <HI>meritorious,</HI> and <HI>per|fectly effectual cause</HI> of <HI>mans justification</HI>; and howbeit <HI>T.D.</HI> is so blind as to deny our <HI>satisfaction by that righteousnesse</HI> whereof <HI>Christ</HI> is the <HI>Author</HI> p. 23. and to beleive that he that holds <HI>justification</HI> by <HI>this righteousnesse</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> thats wrought <HI>in the Saints</HI> by his <HI>Spirit</HI> cannot be saved, p. 38. For he owns this sentence there for truth (<HI>viz.) that any man that holds that principle of being justified by a righteousnesse within us, living and dying i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that principle cannot be saved.</HI> Yet I not only say, but see so much, and hope
<PB N="89" REF="79">
(as great a Malefactor as <HI>T.D.</HI> p. 54. makes me for it) to make any (save such as seeing will not see) to see the same, that he cannot be saved, who holds it not, but looks for <HI>Salvation</HI> in that <HI>Gospel,</HI> which <HI>T.D. Preaches,</HI> of <HI>a Iustification by a Christ onely without him</HI>; and that he may <HI>fill</HI> up his <HI>floutings</HI> at it, and <HI>compleat</HI> his <HI>cursing</HI> of it, in the same Phrase he <HI>sc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">fingly</HI> renders my speaking this <HI>Truth</HI> in, at the Dispute p. 28. I say again to all People, That <HI>Gospel,</HI> which <HI>T.D.</HI> and his fellows <HI>Preach, of Salvation by Christ without them, without the Revelation of Christ and his Righteousness within them, will not bring men to Heaven. Indeed People it will not.</HI> And this is that I am to have the second Talking with <HI>T.D.</HI> about, before I come again to <HI>I.O. (viz.)</HI> this point of <HI>Iustification,</HI> whether it, which we say is by <HI>Christs Righteousness</HI> and <HI>Good Works</HI> alone, and not any thing that is done <HI>by us,</HI> simply as <HI>of our selves,</HI> be by the <HI>Righteousness of Christ without us onely</HI> (as <HI>T.D.</HI> saith it is) or <HI>by that, which he performs in us also by the sam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Power,</HI> as we affirm it.</P>
<P>In the Prosecution of which matter, which way soever the cause should seem to go in the Consciences of such as are considerate, yet to the eye of every ordinary Observer of him <HI>T.Ds. weaknesses,</HI> and <HI>absurdities</HI> are so <HI>gross</HI> and <HI>obvious,</HI> that he that <HI>Runs</HI> may <HI>Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d</HI> them, sundry of which I shall give the <HI>Reader</HI> a taste of as I go along, that he may know how to <HI>Relish</HI> him in the <HI>Rest.</HI></P>
<P>Hear then O ye <HI>deaf,</HI> look and see <HI>ye blind Believers</HI> and <HI>Admirers</HI> of <HI>T.D.</HI> and his <HI>applauded Pamphlet,</HI> how he (to turn his own Terms to <HI>G.

<P><HI>T. D.</HI> Tells the world, that the <HI>Terms</HI> of the <HI>Question</HI> were, whether <HI>Good Works</HI> (Mark) be the <HI>meritorious cause of Iustification</HI> p. 58. and that this was <HI>expresly affirmed</HI> bylus: and saith <HI>T.D.</HI> This being so <HI>gross &amp; Popsh, L.

<P><HI>Rep.</HI> By the way let me tell thee Reader, as from <HI>L.

<P>Further, yet much more is to be said in proof of it, that our being first led by the <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> into the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of his working in us, is <HI>Antecedent</HI> to our <HI>Iustification,</HI> as a <HI>meritorious cause</HI> of it, though consi|dering how slenderly <HI>T.

<P N="1">1. To this Argument from <HI>Gal.</HI> 5.18. <HI>They who are led of the Spirit, are not under the Law</HI>; therefore <HI>being led of the Spirit, is a meritorious cause of not being under the Law,</HI> and so <HI>consequently of Iustification</HI> or <HI>Non-Condem|nation by it.</HI></P>
<P>Thou <HI>T.D.</HI> Rep'yest, That <HI>I am very silly myself, or take my hearers to be so, thinking this to be a proof of my former consequence, or that there is any con|sequence in this Argument</HI>; whereas first this Argument is urged not so much in proof of my <HI>former consequence,</HI> as entail'd on that, but as <HI>entire</HI> and <HI>absolute within it self</HI>: for as to the proof of the <HI>former consequence,</HI> (viz.) <HI>Contrariorum contraria est Ratio</HI>; therefore as <HI>evil deserve Condem|nation,</HI> so <HI>good works Non-Condemnation</HI>; in proof of which thou sillily sayeth, I should, have pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> that there's <HI>Par.

<P>If such as are <HI>led by the Spirit out of</HI> evill into <HI>good works,</HI> are thereupon <HI>deservedly</HI> not <HI>under the Law,</HI> then their being <HI>led by the Spirit,</HI> who are led by it from under it, is the deserving or <HI>meritorius cause</HI> of their <HI>nor be|ing under the Law,</HI> and so of <HI>Iustification.</HI></P>

<P>The Minor which (unless thou wilt deny thy Principles) its like thou wilt deny, is thus proved;</P>
<P>Those <HI>against whom deservedly there is no Law,</HI> are thereupon <HI>deservedly</HI> from under the <HI>condemning power</HI> of it; for such is the R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gour of the Law, that who ere deserves the <HI>Condemnation</HI> of it, till they come <HI>not to de|serve it,</HI> first or last, shall assuredly feel it.</P>
<P>But <HI>there is no Law deservedly against such as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> not after the flesh into evil, but after the Spirit</HI> into <HI>good works</HI>; therefore according to that also <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.1 <HI>deservedly no Condemnation.</HI></P>
<P>For indeed those and no other (what ere ye deem to the contrary, being deluded by the Devil, to the deceiving of your own Souls) are truly <HI>in Christ Iesus,</HI> then those that are <HI>led by the Spirit,</HI> which who is led by, is led <HI>out of evil,</HI> for it leads into nothing but <HI>good,</HI> those onely are <HI>in the Spirit,</HI> and all the rest <HI>in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> which follow the <HI>flesh</HI> in its <HI>lustings</HI> against <HI>the Spirit,</HI> and so under <HI>the Law</HI> and <HI>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e,</HI> thought they

<P>Is it so Friends, that no man can <HI>appear to himself</HI> to be <HI>approved</HI> and <HI>justified in Gods sight,</HI> nor <HI>to himself</HI> or <HI>others</HI> be known that he is so, till he comes to <HI>believe,</HI> and do other <HI>good works</HI> of <HI>Righteousness,</HI> which first <HI>declare</HI> the thing so to be?

The <HI>Spirit in us doth not conform us to the Law fully</HI> (quoth he) <HI>notwitstanding your vain assertion of perfection.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rep.</HI> I never said that the Spirit of Christ <HI>in you</HI> did conform <HI>you</HI> fully to the Law, if when thou sayst (<HI>conform us</HI>) thou meanst <HI>your selves</HI>; for ye are farenough from <HI>perfection,</HI> to whom it seemes A <HI>vain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">assertion,</HI> A <HI>Doctrine of Devils,</HI> to talk of or reach it, and how should the <HI>Spirit</HI> conform you to the Law, who though you have it striving in you and reproving you of sin, yet do in the <HI>stiffnesse and uncircumcis'dnesse of your hearts and eares alwayes quench, grieve, resist it,</HI> refuse to be led by it and will not walk after it; but after the flesh? But the Saints (and such onely are all those that walk af|ter it, and not after the flesh) it eitheir conforms them to the Law, and <HI>that fully</HI> too, or else what doth it conform them to? Partly the <HI>Law</HI> and partly the Lust? Partly to it selfe, and partly to the flesh? Doth it lead any into any sin, which is transgression of the Law? Or onely out of all sin all such as give up to be guided by it? If any be at all deform'd, it is because they conform to the flesh, and follow it, and stop the Spirit; but if any conform to the Spirit, and follow it, it will conform them fully to the Law, and not to the <HI>forms, fashions, foolish fellowships</HI> and <HI>lusts</HI> of the world, but <HI>transform</HI> them from all these by the <HI>renewing of their minds,</HI> and lead them to <HI>perfect holynesse in the fear of God,</HI> thy vain assertion to the contrary in any wise norwithstanding.</P>

<P><HI>Rep.</HI> Oh strange! that <HI>T.D.</HI> should deem theres strength in this to stand out against us by, which is far weaker then the former: Doth the Spirit working holinesse in our natures and persons, not merit <HI>justifica|tion,</HI> which is <HI>non-condemnation</HI>? are Christ and his Spirits works of lesse or worse merit in one time place and person then another? I judg'd they had been every where, and alwayes alike, and of like good desert from the <HI>dignity of the person doing</HI> them (or else <HI>T.D.</HI> lyes p. 15. of his 1. <HI>Pamp</HI>) and especially that their <HI>good works, which are the fulfilling of the Law deserve non-condemnation</HI> (1) <HI>justification</HI> (or else <HI>T.D.</HI> lyes again in that same <HI>page</HI>) but sith <HI>the Spirit of life,</HI> and <HI>works of holinesse</HI> in our <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>persons conforming them fully to the Law</HI> do not (as <HI>T.D. p.</HI> 15. said before they did from <HI>the dignity of Christs person) deserve non-condemnation</HI> (for their <HI>conformity</HI> to, it, or <HI>transgression</HI> of it <HI>merits</HI> one thing or other, <HI>good</HI> or <HI>evill</HI>; and we use to say no <HI>truly good work deserves evill,</HI> more then an <HI>evill work merits good</HI>) we will take it for granted that <HI>T.D.</HI> thinks the <HI>Spirits conforming us to the Law deserves condemnation,</HI> and so let it stand that all people may understand the <HI>Blasphemy</HI> and <HI>Folly</HI> of it.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>T.D.</HI> pulls hard to have his own again, but what he can't win by force of <HI>false position,</HI> heel see if he can beg it back from us in these fol|lowing <HI>fawning Questions.</HI></P>

<P>Now concerning these which are the <HI>grand Subjects,</HI> in reference to which all that is said of any of them by either of us, in our <HI>Disputation</HI>

<P>What Testimony it is that we bear of the grace of God, the Spirits guidance, Perfection, and true Light (the Subjects which we plead for, and thou impleadest) will be seen when I come in all plainness to give it out, with the good grounds thereof, as at last I shall (God willing) howbeit not till toward the last, for as much as in the last place thy <HI>false wit|nesse</HI> comes out against it; and in the mean while betake my self to the in|tended Tryal of those things which are (as blindly, as boldly) bolted out by thee about the <HI>Scriptures</HI>; and to declare wherein we do, and wherein we do not, and also why it is (where-ever we do not) that we neither do, nor may, nor can accord at all with thee about the <HI>Scripture,</HI> for not Assenting to whose meer <HI>fancies</HI> about which, as infallible and undoubted <HI>Truths,</HI> (having hung up thy <HI>Flag of Defiance</HI> against <HI>Atheists, Anti-scriptural Iewes,</HI> and <HI>Papists,</HI> and sought up thy <HI>foolish fight</HI> also with sundry of thy fellow <HI>Protestant Divines,</HI> for not <HI>dancing</HI> after thy <HI>unharmonious Pipe,</HI> nor <HI>singing</HI> to the same <HI>Truthlesse tune</HI> with thee about the <HI>Scriptures</HI>) Thou beatest up the <HI>Quarters</HI> of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and unjustly <HI>Quarrel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st</HI> against them, <HI>slandering</HI> them (as fowlely, as falsly) in a long <HI>Latine Piece</HI> of <HI>Scholastical scrible,</HI> as <HI>slanderers</HI> of the <HI>Scripture</HI>; whom yet thou neither dost, nor canst evince to be such, unless that be to <HI>slander</HI> the <HI>Scripture</HI> to say no more of it then matter of truth.</P>

<LIST>
<ITEM>1. In regard that not only <HI>T.

O.</HI> DD. sayest it, will unquestionably more then think it to be all Truth that thou sayest of our <HI>Co-Partnership</HI> with the <HI>Papists</HI> in their <HI>basenesse</HI> towards the Scriptures, in those false sayings of thine that are

fore-cited, wherein thou injuriously avouchest us to be <HI>Approvers</HI> of all their <HI>Tauntings,</HI> and <HI>joynt Blasphemers</HI> with them of the Scriptures.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. In regard that (howbeit it is not at all in Vindication of the <HI>Popish Clergy</HI> in any of their Devilish doings, nor scornful, or spiteful speakings against the Scripture, but of another <HI>Interest,</HI> even that of the true <HI>Clergy,</HI> or <HI>Heritage</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> (as remote from Theirs and Thine too, <GAP DESC="foreign">, I am an Opposer of thee as to that same Book, wherein thou so vehemently Opposest the Papists; hence many may, as some already do suppose I am in far firmer <HI>friendship</HI> and <HI>fellowship</HI> with that <HI>Fry of fighters</HI> against the Scripture, then with <HI>thee</HI> and thy <HI>fellows,</HI> who wouldest fain seem at least to fight against them for it; but (if any man will be ignorant of me and my honest meanings, let him be ignorant) for my part as I am a well-wisher to all Souls, and am in friendship with all men, having and holding as truly <HI>Pacem cum Personis,</HI> as <HI>cum Peccatis Bellum</HI>; so I am in no <HI>fel|lowship</HI> with that in all men, whether of the <HI>Romish Religion,</HI> or that which (<HI>informe</HI>) is more <HI>Reformed,</HI> that is not in <HI>fellowship</HI> with the Scriptures, (for that which is not in union therewith, is not in fellowship with God) fighting against neither smal nor great, save only against the sinful <HI>seed</HI> of the <HI>Serpent</HI> in them, which from the <HI>spirits</HI> of the <HI>spiritually</HI> throughout all <HI>Christendom,</HI> spawnes it self forth in <HI>spite,</HI> and <HI>spiritual</HI> wickednesse against the <HI>seed</HI> of the <HI>Woman,</HI> who must bruise his head at last, though he obtains for a while to bruise her heel, between whose seed, which is one, and his seed of every sort, whose name is <HI>Legion</HI> (for they are many) the most endlesse enmity is; so that though I appear against those Paper-works of thine, wherein thou appearest upon the Stage, in <HI>part</HI> against that <HI>Synagogue of Satan</HI> (but more palpably against the <HI>Synagogue</HI> of the <HI>Saints</HI>) yet this is not all to gratifie the <HI>Romanists</HI> in their <HI>scurrilities</HI> against the Scriptures, more then thee and thine <HI>Abettors</HI> in your <HI>scarce Schollar-like,</HI> much lesse <HI>Scripture-like scoldings</HI> for them; but as occasion is (<HI>Pro Scripturis</HI>) for the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> which, notwithstanding thy empty <HI>Apologetica's</HI> for them, ye, and the Papists also are both utterly against, I shall not spare to grate hard against you both, as such, who while you are <HI>scribling</HI> of the <HI>Scrip|tures,</HI> whether <HI>Pro</HI> or <HI>Con,</HI> are yet our of that precious <HI>Truth</HI> the Scripture tells of, and against that <HI>living Word,</HI> that <HI>eternal</HI> and <HI>internal Light</HI> it calls to, which leads to that <HI>Life of God</HI> that the Scripture calls for.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. In regard that I am, and shall unavoidably be found in this present Controversie with thee, saying some things against thee and thy untrue <HI>Assertions</HI> for Truths sake (yet with a due Respect thereunto) which the very <HI>Papists</HI> say (though truly enough, yet too <HI>disrespectfully</HI>) about the <HI>Scriptures.</HI> In this respect though, I would not have them so; yet I be|lieve some are, and some will be (if peradventure these Premises prevent it not) so blind as to believe I own the <HI>Pope</HI> and his <HI>Apostolical Church,</HI> be|cause I cannot own all that as true and <HI>Apostolical,</HI> which some <HI>Prime Pro|testants</HI> tell for Truth, but rather tell the <HI>Truth</HI> with him when he tells it a|bout the Scripture, or any other thing, then Errour and Lyes with those, who pretendedly for the <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Pro Scripturis,</HI> Protest against him: For I must give the <HI>Devil</HI> his due, so as to acknowledge his Words to be true, when he speaks the <HI>Truth,</HI> though to a false end, rather then sooth up thee

<HI>I.O.</HI> or any other men, so as to say the <HI>Crow is white,</HI> and that ye utter Truth, when ye tell utter untruth, though against the <HI>Devil</HI> himself, to please either thee, or them.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Howbeit many men in these dayes, and not a few of those, who are cal|led <HI>Christs Ministers,</HI> and counted well studied <HI>Schollars,</HI> or at least would not be well contented to be not so accounted, are yet so <HI>dim,</HI> as without any more ado to <HI>deem</HI> them to be <HI>Romish Priests,</HI> under <HI>Pay from the Pope,</HI> who own some <HI>Truths,</HI> which his Priesthood owns (as if because at <HI>Rome</HI> they own Christ to be the <HI>Son of God,</HI> they must needs be of that <HI>Church,</HI> who deny him not so to be) but more especially any Truths, which by these <HI>Divine Deemers</HI> are not <HI>Deemed</HI> to be <HI>Truths,</HI> and thereupon disowned by their <HI>non-discerning selves,</HI> upon whose crazy <HI>Concerts,</HI> and cloudy <HI>Ac|counts,</HI> and crooked <HI>Conjectures,</HI> some, that do more service to the <HI>Truth</HI> a|gainst <HI>Popish Fictions</HI> in a year, then themselves do in an Age, are thorow their <HI>shallow surmises</HI> by their <HI>implicit Faith't</HI> People, as sinisterly supposed to be Supporters of the Papal <HI>Hierarchy,</HI> because themselves, whose <HI>Idol</HI> the <HI>Letter</HI> is, are not digested in all their Extravagant <HI>Exaltings</HI> of it, though the <HI>Popes</HI> extream of <HI>Exalting</HI> his <HI>leaden Legends,</HI> and <HI>Holy Chaire</HI> above it, be more professedly <HI>distasted</HI> and <HI>detested.</HI></P>
<P>Thus such as believe, according to the Scripture, the <HI>general Grace,</HI> and <HI>Love of God</HI> in giving <HI>Christ</HI> to die for all men, for as much as that also is be|lieved at <HI>Rome,</HI> seem to these <HI>senslesse</HI> ones to favour too much of <HI>Popery,</HI> because the empty understandings, narrow Nodels, and heedlesse Head|pieces of many Protestant Parish <HI>Priests</HI> are not as yet enlarged enough to comprehend it; who notwithstanding being blear-eyed at home, whilest Eagle eyed abroad, <HI>Nunquam vident id manticae, quod in tergo est,</HI> never come to see, or sent that <HI>plain Popery</HI> of their <HI>Parish Posture</HI> and <HI>Parish pay</HI> by way of <HI>Tythes,</HI> which the Night is now too far spent for any but <HI>Owles, Bats</HI> and <HI>Night-birds</HI> not to see, that its of the <HI>Pope</HI>; sith though its a piece of stark rank and Popery, not held without the guilt of Perjury, yet, as its their own (<HI>&amp; suus cuique crepitus bene olet</HI>) so its that which serves their turn better at this time, then the Extirpation of it <HI>Root and Branch</HI> according to their Oathes (which would savour lesse of Popery, and more of pure Pietv) will ever do.</P>
<P>Of this sort of Evil Surmisers is <HI>T. D.</HI> who, not only as thou <HI>I. O.</HI> dost, Accuses us (me in particular) as one big with, and <HI>spitting</HI> out <HI>venome</HI> a|gainst the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> for not owning those outward Writings as the only Rule of <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>holy Life,</HI> but also accounts of us, as no other then broa|chers of Popish <HI>Doctrines,</HI> and bringers in of the <HI>Popes Baggage,</HI> for dissen|ting as in other points so from his blind <HI>Tenets</HI> about the Scriptures</P>
<P>Yea, so earnestly doth <HI>T. D.</HI> drive on his Design of Insinuating it into mens minds concerning me, that I am <HI>Popishly affected,</HI> that he finds occasion of Accusation against me as so, as well where I more fully own the Scrip|ture, then himself does, as where I may more easily seem (to one thats blind) to deny it. Witnesse his words, <HI>Page</HI> 27. 1. <HI>Pamph</HI> where for owning the <HI>Epistle</HI> of <HI>Paul</HI> to LAODICEA, which he sputns at as Spurious, he flyes thus foolishly in my face:</P>

<P><HI>Reply</HI> 1. What a wicked and Adulterous Generation of men is this? like that in which Christ lived, who would have something to say against the Gospel and the Truth, let it come handed to them which way soever; they would neither lament at Christs mourning to them in <HI>Iohns</HI> Ministry, nor Dance at his Piping to them in his own, but reject and belye him when he came contrarily to them in <HI>Iohns</HI> Fastings; and condescendingly to them in his own Eatings and Drinkings, as either having a Devil, or being a Drunkard, or a Glutt&ograve;n, or a Friend of Gods Enemies, and Sinners, or somewhat or other still that was nought, rather then own the Truth at any hand that in both Ministryes was held out unto them; So is the Ear of our now Pharifaical generation of Scribes stop'd, like that of the deaf Adder at the Voice of the Charmer, let him Charm never so wisely; among whom <HI>T.D.</HI> is a Chieftain, who Ranks us among the Popish party, as spitting out our venome, that we are big with against it, <HI>Page</HI> 28. 1 <HI>Pamph.</HI> and as de|nyers of the Scripture together with them, because we deny many false things that many such Ministers as himself do most absurdly affirm of it; and yet Charges us as Brotherly owners and Abbetors of the Papists wick|ednesse also, for owning the holy Scripture in many parts of it, wherein our <HI>English</HI> Ministers do not blush to deny it, and so consequently for own|ing it much more truly and fully then themselves: Thus,

<P>If we should, as they falsly&punc; Accuse us, own the Scriptures lesse then our Accusers do, we must be Papists; if we own them more, and more of them then themselves do, we must be no lesse then Papists.</P>

<P>But that I am not so Popishly affected as I am, as well every way, as every where misrepresented to be by those, who to sit the more securely in their own Popishnesse, do in the Apishnesse of their Spirits sound it out with a dreadful noise to the stunning of their already <HI>Pope-serving</HI> people, <HI>Popery, Popery,</HI> against all that come neer to Storm them out of their Popified Pa|rish postures, practises and preferments, to what I have said sufficiently a|bove, I shall now adde what followes in evidence thereof, whether you will hear (O all ye my unjust Accusers in that particular) or whether ye will forbear, to the perfect ending of my <HI>Protestation</HI> which I have begun to enter against that Synagogue of Rome, <HI>viz.

<P>Yea, those that <HI>undervalue</HI> the Scripture so as to set <HI>Traditions</HI> above it, and they that <HI>overvalue</HI> it so as to set the <HI>Light</HI> below it, both these must come under Condemnation from me, as being both Abomination to the Lord, before whom (witness the <HI>Brazen Serpent,</HI> and <HI>Christs Apostles,</HI> Acts 14.11. to 19. whom the people did worse in Worshipping <HI>as Gods,</HI> then if

<P>Object. <HI>Oh but</HI> (quoth <HI>I.O.) no matter what the</HI> Quakers <HI>confesse of the</HI> Scripture <HI>now; no doubt had things fallen out accordinn to their desire, and if People could have born the denyal of it, who bore such respect to the</HI> Scripture, <HI>that they would have flown with fury on the</HI> Quakers Pates, <HI>if they should have seemed to deny it, the</HI> Quakers <HI>from whom the fear of that more then the force of Truth forces that Confession,</HI> Proculdubi&ograve; Jamdudum rejecissent, <HI>had doubtlesly Re|jected them utterly long ago,</HI> Ex. 3.

<P><HI>Reply.</HI> This is not so true not well-grunded a Surmise as this, <HI>viz.</HI> No matter how the Priests fawn, own the Kings, Protectors, Parliaments or Powers still that are in present Being, to save their Standings in their pre|sent Places and Preferments; No heed's to be given to their Crouchings Cringing and Humble <HI>Representations</HI>; No doubt but as things fall out, and succeed to the serving of their Interest, they will turn still to what best serves their turns, and have, <HI>Exceptis excipiendis,</HI> been generally known to have done so now long ago, even from <HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>Eighths</HI> time to this very day.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Quakers,</HI> could they have dissembled so as ye do for fear of mans Fury, they might have escaped many, if not all those furious Fallings of your bloudy mad-brain'd Parish-Professors upon their Pares, and have saved <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Cambridge</HI> that labour &amp; pains, they more like <HI>Fiends,</HI> then <HI>Friends</HI> of Truth, have been at to persecute them long since also.</P>
<P>Again. <HI>I.O.</HI> Dost not thou say 'tis <HI>evident enough that some of us</HI> Read the Holy Scripture in Private, <HI>or at least</HI> Remember <HI>what we have Read or Heard out of it, and for the most part carry the</HI> Holy Bible <HI>about with us, and that in our</HI> Digladiations <HI>or</HI> Disputes <HI>we very often rehearse and urge the words of the</HI> Scriptures; <HI>and that the reason why we own</HI> Translations <HI>is, because being not learn'd farther then our Mother Tongue, we shall then deprive our selves of all use of the</HI> Scriptures, <HI>which we are loath to do</HI>?</P>
<P>Which of these two <HI>I O's.</HI> must we believe? Or if it be but one <HI>I.O.</HI> (as no doubt it is) divided against himself, and telling two contrary Tales, whereof but one can be true; which of his two Testimonies must men give credit to? That wherein he sayes we strive to bereave men of <HI>All Vse of the</HI> Scripture, and count it odious and abominable to have <HI>Heresies, Errour, false Doctors</HI> and <HI>Doctrines Convicted</HI> and <HI>Confuted</HI> out of it; Or that clean <HI>Con|trary one,</HI> wherein he tells all men that we use it so as to Read it in <HI>Private, Remember what we Read,</HI> or <HI>Hear of it; Carry it about with</HI> us, <HI>use it,</HI> and <HI>urge out of</HI> it in our <HI>Disputes,</HI> and are <HI>shy</HI> of <HI>denying</HI> it to be <HI>Translated</HI> into <HI>English</HI> for our <HI>use, least we should be deprived of All that Vse of it our selves, which we are willing to make.</HI></P>
<P>For my part, let others do what they will, I have found <HI>I.O.</HI> telling so many Lyes, when in his malice, he talkes against the <HI>Quakers,</HI> that I shall rather take that for Truth now, which against his envious <HI>lying self</HI> he here
<PB N="60" REF="145">
talks for them; for some <HI>Vse,</HI> and that not a little himself here affirms we make of the Scriptures; and in other places quotes many Scriptures out of which we argue against our Opposers; and if it be never so <HI>little use</HI> its enough to stop his mouth out of his own mouth, who sayes we <HI>utterly reject</HI> the Scriptures as to <HI>All its Vse,</HI> for he that rejects it as to its Whole use, or All its use, must be one that makes no use of it at all.</P>
<P>And if <HI>I.O's.</HI> Testimony had been only, that we deny many <HI>ill uses</HI> of it, that himself and other Scribes make, that spend and take up more time in scraping and scribling for it, then take care to live the life of it, and that wrest it to their own ruine, he had said the Truth; Or had he said we de|ny many of those good lifes, that many make of it, he had much lessened his Lye and his Folly in it; but because we own it not as <HI>useful</HI> to all those extraordinary, weighty and mighty lifes, which he sayes falsly are to be made of it, which indeed are to be made only of the <HI>Eternal, Internal Spi|rit, Word</HI> and <HI>Light</HI> it came from; to say we deny <HI>all Vses</HI> of it, as if it were good, and profitable, and useful, and fit for nothing, this renders his Lye the more lyable to all mens view, and himself to be as blind as one that can see no difference between <HI>staring</HI> and <HI>stark mad.</HI></P>
<P>What <HI>I. O.</HI> is that which is not said to be good for all things, thereupon said to be good for nothing? If I should say <HI>soft Wax</HI> is not useful to stop <HI>hot Ovens</HI> with, must it straitway be thrown away? and must it be taken for Granted, that I say its not good to Seal with, or that its useful for no|thing? That may be good to <HI>Cut</HI> and <HI>Kill</HI> (as a Knife) that when it hath so done, can't quicken, nor heal, nor save, nor cure; The <HI>Letter kills,</HI> as an Executing Instrument, but the <HI>Spirit</HI> only gives the Life.</P>
<P>And whereas thou sayest we <HI>wish it blotted out, that men may come to the Light within, in which is the life</HI>; Nay stay <HI>I. O.</HI> no hast to hang true men, we would have all come to the Light and Life within indeed, no such hast yet of the Scriptures going hence though old it will wax once and wear a|way; there's many pretious Uses, though not all the Eminent ones thou talkest of to be made of it before it go hence; One whereof is that very thing upon the account of which thou falsly sayest we wish it blotted out, viz. <HI>That men may come to the Light within,</HI> which the Scripture is so far from hindering any from coming to (but only that the blind Porers in it with their natural Eyes, cannot see Wood for Trees) that it sides with us in helping to call People to the Light in the Heart, which thing is as well the end of its being written, as it was the end of <HI>Paul,</HI> and <HI>Iohn's,</HI> and all the Prophets Ministry by word of mouth, <HI>Act</HI> 26.17, 18. 1 <HI>Ioh.</HI> 1.1, 5, 6, 7. And is the end of all our Ministring now, as we are moved of the Lord, by Voice or Writing; the Letter bids look to the Light, as that which leads on to the Life, but both Letter and Light are a cloud to the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> that pursued them, which to <HI>Israel,</HI> that <HI>obeyed</HI> it, was a <HI>help.</HI></P>
<P>And as it serves with us to call to the Light, so before it passe away, it must be used against them, to send them packing first that have Abused it, as thou hast done, and to accuse as a Witnesse against them such as have owned it as their Rule and Foundation yet lived and built so much (as ye have done) beside it. And as Christ said to the old Scripture-<HI>searching|Scribes,</HI> Joh. 5. that would never come to him the Life, whom they Testifi|ed

of; so say I to you of the same Seed, Do not think that Christ by his Light, within you only, whereby ye are made as all men are, who have not the Law in a Letter, a Law before God to your selves, will accuse you to the Father, ye have another that accuses you for your Vanities and Deceits, even <HI>Moses</HI> and the <HI>Apostles</HI> and <HI>Prophets Writings,</HI> in whom ye trust to get Life; for if you had believed them, you would not have belyed, but be|leeved in and obeyed the Light and Word in the Heart, which they call you to, for the Scriptures testifie of that; but fith you believe not their Te|stimony to the Light, how can we look that by our Words ye should come to believe in the Light it self.</P>
<P>So that ye stand Condemned, and must be Judged by the Law or Light within, as well as such as are without the <HI>Law</HI> in a Letter <HI>without</HI>; and fin|ing under and against the Law in the Letter, by the very Letter of the Law, throw boasting, and yet breaking of which, ye dishonour God much more then the Heathen do, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2. Ye must be condemned also.</P>
<P>So that the Scripture is of much use yet, and we are free it should stand, and not be blotted out, that by the Testimony of it, which is one and the same with ours to the Light, ye might be (if yet it may be) brought to look to the Law of <HI>Christ,</HI> which (and not the Letter) is the Light and Life; but if you will not come to <HI>Christ</HI> and his <HI>Light</HI> in you, that ye may have the <HI>Life</HI>; its all of a price to you, whether the Scripture <HI>stand</HI> or be <HI>blotted out,</HI> for your <HI>Names</HI> are not (while ye are Enemies to the Light) written there for <HI>Life,</HI> but as yet blotted out even by the Scripture, while it abides <HI>unblotted out,</HI> from under Heaven.</P>

<P>I cannot say of this indeed, as of <HI>T.D.</HI> his doings in his way of sharp <HI>shooting</HI> out his false Tales against us, that it will sound much to our shame in a <HI>Countrey Church,</HI> because its well nigh all laid out, not to say lyed out in the <HI>Latine</HI> Tongue (though only Englished here) but it will ring such a Peal in the University <HI>Colledges,</HI> among the <HI>Iunior</HI> sort of Haters of whom God loves, and among all (save the <HI>lack-Latine-Country-Clergy men</HI>) against the <HI>Quakers,</HI> as will make them prick up their Ears and listen (that they may learn how to lye against them also) more then ever they did to the <HI>Quakers</HI> themselves, that of them they might learn the Truth; but the best on't is, though here's a Nest of them together, if that would do any good to <HI>I.O.</HI> or hurt to the <HI>Quakers,</HI> yet by Lyes and Deceits none ever did, or ever must prevail against the Truth.</P>
<P>Yet to all this thou addest, <HI>That we turn the Church of God into a Hogsty</HI>; And <HI>that we are great Reproachers of that Divine Goodnesse that gave it, in set|ting so slight by Interpretations of the</HI> Scripture <HI>in order to the understanding of it:</HI> To all which yet I shall answer no otherwise then thus <HI>briefly</HI> and <HI>soberly</HI> as followes.</P>
<P><HI>Viz.</HI> We acknowledge Gods goodnesse in giving it, and deny not all exposition of the matters in it, provided it be by them, as they are so mo|ved, that live in the <HI>light</HI> and <HI>spirit</HI> of God that gave it forth by holy men, which onely opens it aright and knows its own, and searcheth the deep things of God, that are laid down in it, in the writings and meetings and <HI>Churches</HI> and <HI>Schools</HI> of the Saints and Believers (which wot you well are not your <HI>Christ-Church Colledges</HI> nor <HI>Academical</HI> Covents, but the <HI>Quakers Publick Congregations,</HI> where I have sometimes had and heard more <HI>Scripture</HI> truly opened in an hour, than in some <HI>Steeple houses</HI> in a year, any more than we do any true <HI>Translations</HI> of it out of our Tongue into another, of which matter about Translation sith thou sayest we covertly conceal our coun|sel,

<P><HI>First,</HI> Let both <HI>Flocks</HI> be viewed, the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and the <HI>Parish People</HI>; I will not say but that among them that are called <HI>Quakers,</HI> that frequent the Places of their <HI>Publick Speaking,</HI> there are many, not only by reason of whom, but also by whom the way of <HI>Truth</HI> that the <HI>Quakers</HI> walk in, is evil Spoken of; but <HI>I O.</HI> either <HI>hath,</HI> or <HI>should have</HI> more <HI>wit,</HI> and <HI>sense,</HI> and <HI>rea|son,</HI> then to account the Routs, that are made by a <HI>rabble</HI> of <HI>rude ones</HI> that frequent the <HI>Quakers</HI> Meetings, to render them odious with their odious Carriages, to the <HI>Quakers</HI> themselves; that he ought, <HI>Non Trepidantibus sed Tripudiantibus vitio vertere, qui vertunt seria ludo, &amp; ludunt cum sacris, &amp;c.</HI> to impute not to the <HI>Quakers,</HI> but to <HI>Schollars,</HI> and <HI>Apprentices,</HI> and <HI>Prateis,</HI> and <HI>Players,</HI> and <HI>ungodly Scoffers,</HI> and <HI>Children</HI> of the <HI>Devil,</HI> that make a <HI>Mock</HI> and a <HI>May game</HI> of <HI>Holy Matters,</HI> and would never band so bitterly against the <HI>Quakers</HI> and their Meetings, if there were not something of <HI>God</HI> in both:</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="147"><HI>Secondly,</HI> In their Meetings there may be some Antick tricks done by some that have run out from the <HI>Truth</HI> and lost their Conditions, and being not stedfast in their Watch to the <HI>Light,</HI> have <HI>degenerated</HI> into <HI>Darknesse</HI> and <HI>De|lusion</HI>; by whom some things have been done, and many more then <HI>T.D.</HI> mentions, that are not owned by the <HI>Quakers,</HI> to whom, they are wise men the while, that blame the <HI>Quakers</HI> for it, who can't prevent it, as <HI>Vice-Chancellors</HI> and <HI>Proctors</HI> might young <HI>Schollars</HI> rudeness, and <HI>Magistrates</HI> the Peoples bruitishnesse in <HI>Parishes,</HI> but will not.</P>
<P>And <HI>Thirdly,</HI> In the silent Meetings of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> there may be some that get no further then the outward <HI>Form</HI> of <HI>Godlinesse,</HI> and not grow out into the <HI>Power</HI>; and here and there one that may be over-taken with a fault, which if they be, it shall be found with a witnesse by the Wicked, that <HI>Watch for their Halting,</HI> and will make more of one Malefactor that's found among all the <HI>Quakers,</HI> then of 40 Drunkards, Swearers, Cursers, Scurrilous Scoffers and Scorners, Gamesters, Couzeners, Cheaters, Lyars, Laughers, Light-Talkers, and Lewd-Livers in a Parish; and then many Scores of High-way-men, Theeves, Fellons, Murderers, and hainous Male|factors that are Hanged and Trussed-up every year, that live and die under the <HI>Ministry of the Church of</HI> England.</P>
<P>But make the worst that can be made of the <HI>Quakers</HI> Crimes, if they were 40 fold worse then they are, or rather single out the very Excrements and Dreggs that depend that way, to say something against; yet <HI>Hoc ast|quid nihitest,</HI> that <HI>something</HI> is <HI>nothing</HI> in comparison of that open prosessed <HI>Prophannesse</HI> and <HI>Iniquity</HI> that abounds beyond the bounds of Modesty, yea of <HI>ordinary Immodesty,</HI> and of <HI>Impudency</HI> it self among the <HI>Parish People,</HI> where there is such a constant Custom, and deal of Expounding of, and Preaching from the Scrirture by the Ministerss of their own meanings, upon it; in which meer <HI>Anthropo Theological</HI> Labours of the <HI>Clergy,</HI> the extraordi|nary high Acceptance of which, by the <HI>Powers,</HI> and <HI>Parliaments,</HI> and <HI>Priests</HI> each from other is Expressed and Accosted ordinarily with the Common Complement of <HI>Great Thanks</HI> for their Great Pains; and as eminently fruit|ful and Profitable as thou professest it to be, it is evidently more profitable to the <HI>Preachers Purses,</HI> then the <HI>Peoples Persons,</HI> whether we Consider the Bereavings of poor mens <HI>Bodies</HI> of their Right, or the Successelessnesse of thereof to their <HI>Souls,</HI> which from year to year, are little or nothing the better for the blasted <HI>Ministry</HI> of these Word-stealing <HI>Money-Mongers,</HI> and Self-Sending <HI>Prophets,</HI> which the Lord is against, as fast as they run in his Name, and <HI>Blesses</HI> not, but sayes they shall not profit People at all; and as apparent it is they do not, as 'tis that God sayes they shall not. For from Generation to Generation, what Fruit is found in the <HI>Parish Churches</HI> of the <HI>Popes Constituting?</HI> and what successe to Sanctification and Salvation from <HI>Sin,</HI> by the Great pains of the Successive <HI>Sermonists</HI> of several sorts, that <HI>Simonically</HI> have got their Gifts at <HI>University,</HI> and as <HI>freely</HI> given them out, as they have <HI>freely</HI> received them (if so to do be to Sell them for more Money then they cost them there) is seen by the true <HI>Seers,</HI> who can see little l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sse <HI>Ungodlinesse,</HI> and <HI>Worldly Lusts,</HI> and <HI>Moral Wickednesse,</HI> since the <HI>Old Homilies</HI> were Read by the <HI>Non-Preaching Animatum Curates</HI> were Succeeded by the Powerlesse <HI>Preachers,</HI> that are more Reformed from the more grosse Idola|try

<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Let both <HI>Flocks</HI> he viewed (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Young and Old Schollars at <HI>Universities</HI> (to begin near home at <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Cambridge</HI>) behold those that sit under your Grave Divine <HI>Doctorly</HI> Expositions, and at the <HI>Ocean</HI> of Books that are bound down (beside what a number each hath in his private <HI>Musing</HI> place) by your Library <HI>Benches,</HI> And the <HI>Quakers</HI> that sit in silence, and wait only on the Lord; let both <HI>Flocks</HI> be tryed by their <HI>Fruits,</HI> and see which most resembles <HI>Christ</HI>; and whether the <HI>Quakers</HI> car|riage, or the <HI>Schollars,</HI> since the <HI>Quakers</HI> came among them, have been most <HI>Innocent, Vninjurious,</HI> and <HI>Harmlesse</HI>; and which look most like the <HI>Swine, Wolves, Bears, Tygars, &amp;c.</HI> and which most like the <HI>Fold</HI> and <HI>Lambs</HI> of <HI>Christ.</HI></P>
<P>And which of these Two (<HI>viz.</HI>) the <HI>Quakers</HI> that have the <HI>Word,</HI> and yet are Retired from you to wait upon God alone for their Teaching, and to learn of him at his <HI>own mouth</HI> and <HI>light</HI> in <HI>silence in all Subjection,</HI> not making such a noise as ye <HI>empty Casks</HI> do in your busie brains about <HI>Formal</HI> set times, set by the will of man, for Expositions and Interpretations, nor in Tumbling ore of <HI>Tomes, Bulkie Books,</HI> and Contentious <HI>Commentators</HI>; or your Selves and your University <HI>Schollers,</HI> that make such an infinite ado in your Inventions about <HI>Interpreting</HI> things (sometimes) that would be ten fold plainner then they now are, if Natural <HI>Schoolmen</HI> had let them alone, who when in <HI>aperto &amp; facili posita est salus,</HI> the way to Life lyes as plainly laid down and declared by the Letter in a thousand places, as it does in that one, <HI>Tit.</HI> 2.12, 13, so that there need be no such heaps of Books as there are, more <HI>bulky</HI> then all the <HI>Bible,</HI> to open some one small <HI>Book</HI> of it, do draw Cloudes over the clear Face of it by <HI>interposing</HI> and <HI>imposing</HI> on People the Thicket of your own Thoughts, and darken the open Counsel of it by your Writings without End, and by your Words without Know|ledge.</P>
<P>I say, which of these Two, the <HI>Quakers</HI> or your <HI>Schollers,</HI> bring forth <HI>Fruits</HI> most meet for God, and like those of the <HI>Spirit, Peace, Meeknesse, Pa|tience,
<PB N="67" REF="148">
Temperance, &amp;c.</HI> Gal. 5. Let them be the <HI>Good Trees,</HI> and so known and owned to be by their <HI>Fiuits</HI>; and let them be the true <HI>Flock</HI> of Christ, and be <HI>by us,</HI> as I am sure such are <HI>by himself</HI> accounted as his <HI>Sheep|fold.</HI></P>
<P>And which abounds most in those <HI>Fruits</HI> and <HI>Works of the Flesh</HI> there spo|ken of also, <HI>viz. uncleannesse, lasciviousnesse, wrath, hatred, Drunkennesse, Revellings,</HI> and such like; and which wallows most in that kind of mire, let them be the <HI>Hogs</HI> and <HI>Swine,</HI> and not Christs <HI>Flock</HI> and <HI>Fold,</HI> but he held hence forward for a <HI>Hog-sty.</HI></P>
<P>Now for my part if I were to judge by what Fruits have come forth in and from our Two <HI>Nurseries of Religion</HI> of latter years, and as well in, and from <HI>Oxford</HI> it self, as <HI>Cambridge</HI>; and how many of them in the time of <HI>I.O's.</HI> Vice-Chancellourship there, <HI>I. O.</HI> knows as well as I (even such as are not sit to be named among Christians) and what Fruits of Righ|teousnesse have been found among the <HI>Quakers</HI> both there and elsewhere, who have suffered <HI>innocently,</HI> and (as to rendering evil for evil) <HI>patiently</HI> un|der them and others, I could quickly determine the matter; but sith its like <HI>I.O.</HI> will hardly let me be Judge in my own <HI>Case,</HI> lest I cleave too much to my own <HI>Cause</HI> and <HI>Company,</HI> let such Books as are Extant of the <HI>Schollers Misdemeanours</HI> against the <HI>Quakers</HI> in their own Meetings, who have been alwayes bound to their <HI>Good behaviour</HI> towards the other by that of <HI>God</HI> in their <HI>Consciences</HI> in the midst of all their abuses to the <HI>Quakers</HI>; and then let all men Judge which <HI>Generation</HI> of men, the <HI>Quakers</HI> or <HI>Uni|versity Schollers</HI> and their <HI>Respective Assemblies</HI> do most exactly resemble the deportment of <HI>Swine</HI> in their <HI>Hog-styes.</HI></P>
<P>Besides those sundry Relations that are Extant in Print of the Imprison|ments, Whippings, and other Persecutions of the innocent Servants of the Lords sending among them to warn them of their Wickednesse at <HI>Cam|bridge</HI>; there are Two at least (<HI>viz.</HI>) one stiled, <HI>A true Testimony of the Zeal of the</HI> Oxford <HI>Professors</HI> and <HI>University-men,</HI> put forth by <HI>R.H.</HI> And one much more lately under the Hands of 8 Witnesses, stiled, <HI>A true Relation of some of the Sufferings inflicted upon the</HI> Quakers, as <HI>the Fruits of the Evil doers</HI> (viz.) the <HI>Proctors</HI> and <HI>Schollars</HI> at <HI>Oxford,</HI> in which who reads may see the mat|ters of Fact, to which I Refer such as are minded to be Judges between me and <HI>I.O.</HI> (an <HI>Oxford</HI> man) in this Case, who (if they be not such as are loath to call their <HI>Brothers Theeves,</HI> and their <HI>Sisters Swine</HI>) will assuredly from those <HI>Arch-Abominable</HI> and <HI>Antick-Actions</HI> conclude from thence with me, the <HI>Actors</HI> and <HI>Abbettors</HI> look much more (then like the <HI>Sheep of Christ</HI>) like <HI>Foxes,</HI> and <HI>Bears,</HI> and <HI>Wolves,</HI> and <HI>Dogs,</HI> and <HI>Wilde Boares,</HI> and <HI>Swine.</HI></P>
<P>However, whether it shall stand with <HI>I.O.</HI> or nay, it matters not; I shall from thence infer my Conclusion. That if <HI>Innocency, Quietnesse, Patience un|der Sufferings, Temperance, Godlinesse, Reproving Wickednesse,</HI> and <HI>becoming fools for Christ,</HI> exposing themselves for Truths' sake as Signs and laughing stocks to an Adulterous Generation, be the Characters of such men, as the Scrip|ture calls <HI>Swine</HI>; then that House and Family of the <HI>Quakers</HI> is become a <HI>Hog-stie</HI>; But unless <HI>turning,</HI> and <HI>tearing,</HI> and <HI>renting,</HI> and <HI>trampling,</HI> un|der <HI>feet,</HI> when <HI>Pearls</HI> and <HI>holy things are held out</HI> to them; and devouring, and

<P>I say, Unlesse these boarish, bruitish Gestures, <HI>Cum muliis aliis qua nunc praescribere longum est,</HI> be the behaviour of <HI>Christs Sheep,</HI> then, for all the un|cessant pains of Interpreting of the Scripture at the Well-head of Religi|on, and for all <HI>I.O's.</HI> saying, That if <HI>what we see, and daily hear, would sway us, we would be ashamed to deny the fruit of Expoundings of the Scripture to be best, where they are most Expounded,</HI> as they are (<HI>pro forma</HI>) in the <HI>Universities,</HI> as fair and far from it as they seem to be to themselves, they look more like <HI>Hog-styes</HI> to the view of men after <HI>Gods</HI> heart, and the Children of these <HI>Mothers</HI> more like Herds of <HI>Swine,</HI> then the Places and Persons of the peo|ple called <HI>Quakers</HI> do, among whom there's not such a busling, and such a businesse about mens <HI>Books</HI> in order to it, nor such Clamorous noises about Opening the Scriptures, as is among the <HI>Scribes,</HI> that are Strangers to them; but the words of the <HI>wise,</HI> even of <HI>Wisdom it self, Christ Iesus,</HI> are heard in <HI>quiet</HI> by them that are <HI>Wise,</HI> more then the <HI>Cry</HI> of him that Ruleth among <HI>Fools.</HI></P>
<P>And as for what Fruits of saving <HI>Knowledge of God,</HI> and <HI>Righteousnesse</HI> and <HI>Holinesse</HI> of <HI>Truth</HI> are abounding in most <HI>Academies, Towns, Cities,</HI> and <HI>Places</HI> in all the <HI>Reformed</HI> parts of Christendom more or better then is to be seen among <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Heathens</HI> (unlesse Couzening, Cheating, Lying, Drunken|nesse, and some such like as abound more among <HI>Christians,</HI> then <HI>Turks</HI> that

<P>Having Cleared the <HI>Quakers</HI> from sundry of those <HI>Calumnies</HI> thou falsly castest upon-them as concerning their Carriage toward the <HI>Scriptures</HI> as if they were <HI>Enemies, Haters,</HI> and <HI>Re|proachers</HI> of it, and such-like, who in Truth are its truest Friends, in the former <HI>Chapter</HI>; I come on to Consider some of thy Cloudy Conjectures and Conceits concerning the Bounds of the <HI>Canon</HI> (as ye call it) thereof; the <HI>Hebrew Punctation,</HI> and thy Asserted <HI>Integrity</HI> of both that and the <HI>Greek Texts</HI> of it, without any <HI>variation</HI> to a <HI>very Title</HI>: Concerning the <HI>Canon</HI> of which thou Writest as follows;</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>JOhn Owen. <HI>Pag.</HI> 3. <HI>God spake of</HI> Old, <HI>or</HI> formerly <HI>in the</HI> Prophets; <HI>From the dayes of</HI> Moses <HI>and downwards, unto the</HI> Bounding <HI>and</HI> Consigna|tion <HI>of the</HI> Canon <HI>delivered to the</HI> Judaical Church <HI>in the dayes of</HI> Ezra <HI>and his Companions, the</HI> men of the great Congregation.</P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> 1. Why sayest thou from <HI>Moses downward, &amp;c.</HI> as if he had ne|ver done so before till then? Did not God speak in his <HI>Prophets,</HI> and by them to the men of their several Ages from <HI>Moses upwards</HI> as well as from <HI>Moses downwards?</HI> Did he not speak in <HI>Enooh</HI> the seventh from <HI>Adam,</HI> in <HI>Noah,</HI> in <HI>Abraham, Isaac, Iacob, Lot,</HI> and <HI>Iob,</HI> who lived before <HI>Moses</HI> (if <HI>Catholick Tradition</HI> be to be Credited in one thing as well as another) and whose <HI>Book,</HI> who ever Pen'd it, whether himself, or some other, for ought thou knowest was written <HI>before Mos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</HI> who thou thinkest wrote the first of the Scripture, either <HI>lived</HI> or <HI>wrote?</HI> and by them, who were <HI>upright, righteous, just,</HI> and walked with God, to the wicked unrighteous <HI>World|lings,</HI> and <HI>wantons</HI> who walked with the <HI>Devil</HI> in their <HI>Generations,</HI> who all were before <HI>Moses,</HI> as well as by <HI>Moses,</HI> and those that <HI>lived</HI> after him?</P>
<P N="2">2. Why sayest thou <HI>downwards</HI> to the <HI>Consignation</HI> and <HI>Bounding</HI> of the <HI>Canon</HI> in <HI>Ezra's</HI> days, as if between his dayes and the dayes of <HI>Christs flesh the Spi|rit of the Lord was straitned</HI> (as it never is, <HI>Mic.</HI> 2.) and God had <HI>limitted</HI> and <HI>bound</HI> up himself from manifesting his <HI>mind</HI> cut of his <HI>own mouth,</HI> to any men at all, for so many Hundred years toge|ther, because some <HI>Prophets</HI> had been moved by him to commit to <HI>Writing,</HI> or at least to <HI>permit to be Written</HI> by <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>For every Prophet did not write down either all he said in his dayes, nor all that which in writing is set down of his</HI> seeings, <HI>and</HI> sayings, doings &amp; sufferings <HI>with his own hands; witnesse</HI> Jeremiah <HI>for whom</HI> Baruch <HI>wrote: and who wrote the latter end of the 5 Books of</HI> Moses, <HI>which ye dream he wrote every little and Iota of himself,</HI> Deut. 34.5 <HI>to the end?

Doth not <HI>Wisdom</HI> say of her self, That <HI>in all Ages entering in|to holy Souls she maketh them friends of God, and Prophets?</HI> Wisd. 7.27. And were there no Holy men of God in those dayes, wherein ye imagine all Gods <HI>speaking in and by any Prophets</HI> then was ceased, in and by whom he manifested his Mind as he moved them to <HI>speak</HI> and <HI>write,</HI> as immediately as he had done others before them?</P>
<P>And who told thee, That the <HI>Canon</HI> (as thou call'st it) or <HI>full standing Rule</HI> of <HI>Tryal,</HI> or <HI>infallible Touch-stone</HI> of the <HI>Old Testament Scripture,</HI> to which no|thing must or might be added after it till the time of <HI>Christ</HI> in the flesh was Compleated, and, after its <HI>Consignation</HI> and <HI>Bounding, by them delivered to the</HI> Judaical Church <HI>in the dayes of</HI> Ezra (<HI>alias</HI> Esdras) and <HI>his Companions the men</HI> (as of your own heads ye are pleased to term them) of the <HI>great Congregation</HI>? Whence hast thou these fancies of thine? Or suppose they be not <HI>simply Suppositions,</HI> but <HI>real Truths</HI>; whence dost thou fetch or take them to be so, but from the <HI>untrusty-Traditional-Tales</HI> of thy <HI>Forefathers,</HI> and such <HI>Iewes</HI> as are little lesse then <HI>unerring Oracles</HI> with thee, when saying ought that suits with thee (yea, thou callest <HI>pag.</HI> 203. the Assertion of <HI>Iustin Martyr</HI> of the <HI>Iewes corrupting the</HI> Bible <HI>out of their hatred to</HI> Christians, <HI>An Incredible Figment</HI>) yet little <HI>better, but much worse then ordinary Infidels,</HI> men <HI>feeding themselvns with vain fables, desperate cursed Opposers of Truth, mis|chievous in their devices against the Gospel, of a profound Ignorance in all manner of Learning and Knowledge but only what concerns their own Dunghil Traditions, ad|dicted to monstrous Figments, bewitching, bewitched with Traditions, Idolaters, Magicians, blind, crafty, raging fools, sets, full of deceitfulness, froth, venome, smoke, nothing but faithlesnesse and infidelity it self</HI>; what not thats nought, where any thing issues from their most <HI>Catholick Testimony</HI> that makes against thee, <HI>Pag</HI> 241.242.244.303?</P>
<P>Yea, whence knowest thou (who art easily apt to Question, when it serves thee so to do, whether there ever were such men as the 70. and such men as the <HI>Tiberian Massorites</HI> in <HI>Rerum Natura?</HI> pag. 243.336.) that ever there was such a thing in <HI>Rerum Natur&acirc;</HI> as that <HI>Great Congrega|tion</HI> thou art every where in thy Book so greatly taken with, and ever and anon betaking thy self to for Refuge, but only from thy putting more con|fidence in thy own <HI>uncertain Conjectures,</HI> together with the <HI>Catholick Traditi|on</HI> of the (with thee) <HI>creditlesse Iewes</HI> and <HI>Christians,</HI> then in the <HI>Conjectures</HI> of the <HI>Prolegomen&acirc;,</HI> as Learned as thy self at least, who oppose thee in it? For theres not so much as any Scripture at all that mentions such a set <HI>Sa|nydrim</HI> of <HI>Ezra, Nehemia, Ioshua, Zacharia, Haggai, &amp;c.</HI> as thou settest it down in the <HI>Book</HI> of thy own <HI>Brain,</HI> and the <HI>Counting-house</HI> of thy own <HI>con|ceit</HI> that there was; <HI>pag.</HI> 302.303.</P>
<P>And let it be (as it can be no more then) imagined there was such a <HI>great Congregation,</HI> which (it being, as not possible to know it, so nor here, nor there to mine or any mans Salvation) I'le not search into so far as to put my self into any Capacity of either <HI>saying</HI> or <HI>gain saying</HI> it that there was; and to <HI>ground any</HI> as <HI>I.

when alls done, whence had that <HI>Sanydrim,</HI> such Authority as to <HI>confine</HI> and <HI>bound</HI> out that <HI>Canon,</HI> and <HI>Canonize</HI> some of the Writings of such <HI>Prophets</HI> as ye wot are <HI>Canonical,</HI> and Cashiere the rest of the Writings of the same <HI>Prophets,</HI> and all the Writings of some other <HI>Prophets,</HI> as of no such <HI>divine Authority,</HI> as to Command with their <HI>fellows</HI> in <HI>Gods Name</HI> as his <HI>Word,</HI> and to abrogate them as <HI>Apocryphal</HI> (as ye speak) and <HI>disband</HI> them from the <HI>bench</HI> of <HI>Iudicature,</HI> and to <HI>bind the sweet Influences of the holy Spirit,</HI> so as to say, <HI>O Spirit of God be silent now, blow</HI> no more, nor make any more <HI>Prophets</HI> now for these many hundred years to come, but become <HI>subject</HI> thy self to be <HI>tryed</HI> by the <HI>Touchstone</HI> of the Writings of such <HI>Prophets,</HI> as thou hast al|ready moved to write <HI>Gods Mind,</HI> or so many at least, as it seems <HI>good to us</HI> now to Authorize and Establish into a <HI>standard</HI> for the Tryal of thy <HI>self,</HI> as well as all <HI>false Spirits?</HI></P>
<P>And if <HI>I. O.</HI> say (as he does, <HI>pag.</HI> 303.) That was not called the <HI>Great Congregation</HI> from its <HI>Number,</HI> but <HI>Eminency</HI> of Persons; yet I say are any Persons so Eminent (if <HI>I.O.</HI> be not a Lyar, <HI>pag.</HI> 35.) as to have <HI>Authority</HI> from God to Authorize and Canonize (casting aside what they like not) what seems good to them, into the <HI>Name</HI> (to bespeak <HI>I.

<P><HI>It is indeed</HI> (quoth <HI>I.O.</HI> pag 35.36.) <HI>a Contradiction for men to say</HI> (and if for other men then for <HI>I.O.</HI> [say I] who sayes the same yet sees it not) <HI>They give Authority to the</HI> Scriptures, they Bound the <HI>Canon</HI> and deliver to the Church what it shall be, <HI>which it hath antecedently to their Charter and Concession.</HI></P>
<P>And again, Moreover (to say the same of his supposed <HI>Sanydrim,</HI> that <HI>I O</HI> sayes to the digrading of the <HI>Septuagint</HI> from that high Conceit some have of them, and eminent Account some have them in, <HI>pag.</HI> 339.) If the <HI>Ability of the men be granted, yet what security have we of their Principles and Honesty?</HI> Oh much every way (thinks <HI>I.O.</HI> for, though when he is pleased to speak <HI>diminitively</HI> of men, the Care and Fidelity and Pains of whom in Translating we have as good ground to believe was as great to the full, as any of that of those he Commends in Transcribing, he disparages it into <HI>Oscitancy, Inadver|tency, Negligence, Ignorance,</HI> the <HI>Wisest not seeing all,</HI> and such like, <HI>pag</HI> 319. yet when he speaks of the Care, Pains and Fidelity of men in Transcribing, which is a Work as lyable to <HI>mistakes</HI> as the other, that he may keep up the honour however of his (<HI>infallible</HI>) Transcripts to this day, then he utters himself more <HI>Hyperbolically</HI>; and as for <HI>Ezra</HI> and his <HI>conjectured Companions,</HI> he makes their <HI>labour to Reform the Church, and all the Corruptions crept into the Word</HI> (as he speaks, though if the <HI>Letter</HI> were the <HI>Word</HI> it were not <HI>lyable to Corruption</HI>) little lesse then Monstrous, and their <HI>care in restoring the</HI> Scrip|ture <HI>to its purity</HI> (mark) <HI>extraordinary,</HI> pag. 171 308.

<P>And now I am upon a Consideration of the <HI>Canon</HI> of the Scripture, let me here make an end with thee <HI>I.O.</HI> as concerning this Cogitation of thine a|bout the Consignation of the Canon of both the Old, and that thou callest the New Testament; of which New thou sayest, pag. 27.

Where learnest thou all these Lessons but from the Lectures and lying Le|gends, and voluminous <HI>Lexicons</HI> of the illiterate Literatists of the world that are alwayes laying on, and loading one another with their endlesse, boundlesse, and bottomlesse Scribles about the <HI>outward Original Text</HI> and Transcriptions and Translations of the Scripture in their tedious <HI>Tomes, Tal|muds,</HI> and <HI>Talmudical Traditions</HI> till they are lost from the very Letter, much more the Life it calls to, so that they have no leasure to live, or learn o|thers to live thereafter, in the <HI>inextricable laborynth</HI> of their own Labours a|bout it? Who leads thee into the vain <HI>Imaginations</HI> of these things, but thy own and other mens (well nigh innumerable, and invincible) inventions?

yield to any infallible <HI>Assurance</HI> of, but a croud of Conceits, and Catholick Traditions? with which the world, and ye in it, are so overcharged, that ye cannot contain them now without infinite, frothy and fruitlesse contendings about them, and obtruding your own Observances, imposing your own Supposings, and thrusting each upon other your own bare thred-bare Thoughts of things that (<HI>ne flocci facit</HI>) it amounts not to the value of a <HI>lock of Wooll</HI> (as to Salvation) whether they be known or not, till being throng'd and thrust into the thorny Thicket of your own Thoughts you there tear one another to pieces about the Scripture; insomuch that I truly may, and plainly shall be so bold as flatly to Contradict what thou sayest falsly of thy Canon and Standard, since the closing and com|pleating of it, that tis a means to end all strife, it is rather throw the folly of its <HI>Ministers,</HI> the means of all strife and Confusion in the Christian World.</P>
<P>Thou sayest indeed of the Writings of the <HI>Old</HI> Testament that the Canon thereof had its Consignation, Bounding, and Delivery to the Church, as its Rule, so that from thenceforth nothing Written either from <HI>Moses</HI> upward, or to Christs time downward must be admitted to be owned as Canonical, or inspired Scripture; And thou sayest, <HI>pag.</HI> 27.28.

 <HI>Never indited by the Holy Spirit, as re|mote from being <GAP DESC="foreign">) doth lastly command the close of the immediate Revelation of his Will to be written in a Book,</HI> Rev. 1.11 and <HI>so gives out the whole of his Mind and Counsel unto us in Writing, as a merciful and stedfast relief against all Confusion, darknesse and uncertainty</HI>; but what a Relief it is against Confusion, I shall shew more hereafter.</P>
<P>And as to thy Scriptures <HI>Canonization</HI> or the <HI>Consignation,</HI> compleating Bounding of the <HI>Canon</HI> of it, a few words here about the <HI>manner</HI> and <HI>means</HI> and <HI>true bounds thereof</HI> (for as to the <HI>Question</HI> whether it be a <HI>Canon,</HI> that is, a <HI>Rule</HI> at all yea or not, I may defer it also to another place) let me Ex|postulate with thee <HI>I O.</HI> yet more about it yet how, and by whom your Standard comes to be so Bounded (as ye say it is) and to be limited to those <HI>Demensions</HI> of Latitude, Longitude, and Profundity, that (<HI>ad amussim</HI>) exact Measure, Heighth, Depth, Length and Breadth, that is allotted to it, as (without the <HI>Apocripha</HI>) it stands bound up within your late bound <HI>Bibles?</HI> I mean that such and such Parcels, Prophesies, Proverbs, Histories, Epistles, Holy Sentences, Sacred Sayings, shall stand Owned, Honoured, Signed and Authorized with the Sacred High and Holy Titles of <HI>Gods Word,</HI> Gods Witnesse, Foundation, Rule, inalterable Standard, and not one piece of Holy Writing more or lesse, then those already so Consecrated and Canonized; so that such and such (<HI>puta,</HI> those that ye now commonly call <HI>Canonical</HI>) shall shand as the Standard; and all others; <HI>viz.</HI> those cal|led <HI>Apocryphal,</HI> and whatever are mentioned in that Scripture ye so own, shall stand out of, and off from it, as no part of the Standard while the World stands?</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="153">Who was it?

Whence hast thou this Conceit that God himself Commanded the Close of the <HI>Canon</HI> of the <HI>Old</HI> Testament to be <HI>Malachi,</HI> and the bounds of it to consist of such Books of the Prophets, as ye now have, <HI>exclusively</HI> of such Prophesies, therein mentioned, as ye have not? and the Close of the <HI>Canon</HI> of the <HI>New</HI> to be the <HI>Revelation,</HI> and the bulk of it to be those few Histories, and <HI>Apostolical Epistles,</HI> as ye have <HI>ex|clusively,</HI> of such even therein mentioned, as ye have not?

<P>Who was it God or Man, the Spirit in the Scripture it self, or the <HI>Scribes</HI> in their <HI>Synods, Councels,</HI> and <HI>Consistories</HI> that so Authorized or Canonized these, and expunged those?</P>
<P>Was it not meer Men in their <HI>Imaginations?</HI> Doth the Scripture, do the Spirit and the Apostles therein give any order for, or make any such menti|on in the least of such a matter?

Saying to the Books of Scripture as God sayes to the Waves of the outward <HI>Ocean,</HI> hitherto shall ye come and no further; So many of the <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Apostles Writings</HI> shall be in the <HI>Authority, Nature, Vse</HI> and <HI>Office</HI> of the Supream Determiner of all Truth for ever; and all o|thers, even such as are written by the same men, in the motion of the same Spirits shall be but as common mens <HI>Writings,</HI> and be look'd on <HI>afar off</HI> as <HI>Apocryphal,</HI> i.e. hidden or unknown Writings, that no such notice shall be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aken of, as of the other?</P>
<P>And as for the Books which ye sprinkle with that Name of <HI>Apocryphal,</HI> and give leave to to have a standing with it, but not so as to make any part of your Standard; What think ye of them upon second Thoughts?

Is there nothing among them that may be <HI>judiciously Iudged</HI> to be of as <HI>divine an Original</HI> and <HI>Authority</HI> as some of those particular Letters to private men, as that of <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Philemon,</HI> about private personal, or Domestick matters, which ye own in such a transcendent manner as ye do? Surely if some of hem be <HI>fictitious</HI> or <HI>fabulous</HI> or but <HI>humane,</HI> so that ye will say no better of
<PB N="77" REF="153">
them then <HI>Vox hominem sonat</HI>; yet is there <HI>none,</HI> or <HI>nothing</HI> among them all that is to be noted or counted upon as of <HI>divine Authority</HI> and <HI>Original,</HI> and of as self-evidencing <HI>Efficacy</HI> as some of those ye own? None that ye can see cause to sign <HI>meliore lapillo,</HI> with some better Name then ye vouchsafe them, and standing in the Church then ye allow them? As if they were a cer|tain <HI>mongrel seed</HI> between that of <HI>Canaan</HI> and <HI>Ashdod,</HI> that ye know not well what to make of, nor how to entreat so ill altogether, as not to afford them a middle place in some of your <HI>Bibles</HI> between the <HI>Old</HI> Testament Writings and those ye call the <HI>New,</HI> nor yet so well, as to entertain them into your <HI>Canon</HI> neither?</P>
<P>Surely there be some of them, which when ye <HI>look</HI> them over again not so cursorily as to <HI>over-look</HI> them, as ye ordinarily do, ye may find ground to receive as such, as have as fair a stamp of the <HI>beaming Majesty,</HI> Truth, Holi|nesse and Authority of <HI>God</HI> and his Spirit, as some at least (not to say the most) of those ye ascribe to <HI>God,</HI> as their main or only <HI>Author</HI>; and that do favour as much of <HI>I.O's</HI> so much insisted on <HI>Theo-pneusty,</HI> as some other <HI>Historical, Doctrinal</HI> and <HI>Prophetical</HI> parts of your acknowledged <HI>divinely de|rived Scripture</HI> do, of which (what Infidels soever ye are as concerning them) yet I, together with many others, whereof some are as <HI>Book</HI>|learn'd as your selves, can say <HI>Credo Equidem nec vana Fides genus esse Deorum.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis indeed the <HI>Faith,</HI> or rather <HI>Infidelity</HI> of such as call themselves <HI>Re|formed Churches,</HI> that all those <HI>Books</HI> called the <HI>Apocrypha,</HI> without excepti|on, are in no wise of such <HI>divine Original,</HI> as them ye call <HI>Canonical</HI>; but who first set the one upon the <HI>Bench,</HI> and the other at the <HI>Bar,</HI> I am yet to learn; but this I know, that howbeit ye <HI>second</HI> their <HI>depression</HI> and <HI>digradation</HI> of the one so far below the other, yet as neither one nor t'other were ever Canonized by God himself (if we speak of the Outward Text only, a|bout which my businesse with <HI>I.O.</HI> lyes) into that Name of his <HI>Word,</HI> and into the <HI>Authority</HI> of the <HI>Foundation of Faith,</HI> the infallible Rule of In|terpretation of itself, of Tryal and Examination of <HI>Spirits, Doctrines, &amp;c.</HI> of the <HI>Supream Iudge</HI> also, by which all Controversies of Religion are to be determined, the only pure <HI>Authentical Standard,</HI> unto which the Church is <HI>finally</HI> to <HI>Appeal,</HI> in whose Sentence it is to Rest, into which all Faith is finally to be Resolved; so if such <HI>Synods</HI> of men, either Antient or Modern, as have shouldred out all those at once from sharing with the other Wri|tings in what they can lay just claim to, had been as Spiritually discerning as they were Spiritually blind, shallow and undiscerning, they would have seen cause to have joyned some at least of those <HI>Apocryhal Scriptures</HI> to an <HI>Equal Participation</HI> of that Plea of <HI>divine Original</HI> and <HI>inspiration</HI> with the rest, as without Cause they justled them all out from it by their joynt Con|sent.</P>
<P>And though it be the declared <HI>Faith</HI> of that Assembly of <HI>Divines</HI> that both Houses of <HI>Parliament</HI> advised with 1648. and of the <HI>Congregational Churches</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> whose Confession is put out this instant 1659. as to that <HI>Article</HI> about the Scriptures <HI>word for word</HI> in the same words with the other, That <HI>the Books commonly called</HI> Apocrypha <HI>not being of</HI> divine Inspira|tion <HI>are no part of the</HI> Canon <HI>of the</HI> Scriptures, <HI>and therefore are of no</HI> Authority

in the Church of God, <HI>nor to be any otherwise approved or made use of then o|ther humane Writings</HI>; yet this I declare to the whole World as my Faith concerning them, that though I own neither them, nor the best <HI>bare Wri|ing,</HI> or <HI>outward Text</HI> or <HI>Letter</HI> of the other Scripture at so <HI>high a Rate</HI> as <HI>I.O.</HI> does, who makes the <HI>naked Letter</HI> in all things equivolent to the <HI>holy matter</HI>; yet whatever is truly to be <HI>praedicated</HI> of the <HI>one,</HI> or can solidly be pleaded on the behalf of the <HI>one,</HI> which ye call your <HI>Canon</HI> as to the <HI>divinity</HI> of their <HI>Original,</HI> the same may be pleaded on the behalf of not a <HI>few</HI> of the other.</P>
<P>And as they all, that in general are stilled <HI>Apocryphal,</HI> can plead their Au|thority from long before the <HI>Apostles</HI> dayes; and also the special Care and Providence of <HI>God</HI> (which is an Argument of such weight with <HI>I.O.</HI> and <HI>T.D. pag.</HI> 27. as swayes them not a little into their frivolous Faith about the rest) in the preservation of them to this very day; So that all of them have been kept by the Church, that kept the rest bound up and Tran|slated into various Languages, and as publickly allowed to be publickly Read as the rest, and highly esteemed by <HI>Austin,</HI> and other Fathers, ye <HI>Di|vines</HI> cannot easily be ignorant.</P>
<P>And as for sundry of them, ye are ignorant with a witnesse, if ye see them to be as ye say they are, not of <HI>divine Inspiration,</HI> or see them <HI>not to be</HI> of as <HI>divine an Original</HI> as some, or even any of the other, which ye own so to be.</P>
<P>As for that Fourth Book of <HI>Esdras,</HI> which is but the Second as it stands in the <HI>Apocrypha,</HI> besides that its acknowledged by <HI>Clem, Alexandrinus, Faber,</HI> and many more men of Renown among you, and by many Holy men in these latter times, as well learned as your selves, at least in the <HI>Wisdom of Gods Spirit,</HI> to be written by his <HI>immediate Inspiration</HI>; so is it such a plain <HI>Prophecy</HI> consistent of many Particular Praedictions of things to be fulfilled in these last Ages, as the <HI>like to it,</HI> or a least <HI>clearer</HI> is hardly to be found in all the Scripture besides it; insomuch that he who reads it in the 11, 12, 13, 16 Chapters of it, and some other places, and sees not the <HI>beams of a divine Majesty in it,</HI> and sees not the Matters now managing upon the Stage in the World, that are there foretold in it, reads not in the Light of that Holy Spirit, that moved in the Writing both of that and all other Holy Scrip|ture, and may come before he is well aware to feel ere long the <HI>dint</HI> of that <HI>divine displeasure</HI> that is denounced against the Sinners of the latter Ages, and thereby come to be convinced of the <HI>Divinity</HI> and Truth of that <HI>Scrip|ture,</HI> which our <HI>Divines</HI> that usually see altogether by the <HI>lump,</HI> and are loath to see any Truth <HI>Sigillatim,</HI> till they are all made to see it whether they will or no, will hardly yield to, if they be their <HI>Old-wonted-selves,</HI> till very <HI>Necessity</HI> forces and frights them into the Faith of it.</P>
<P>And the same may be said, as to the <HI>divine Original</HI> of <HI>Ieremiahs</HI> Epistle, which was written and sent to them that were to go Captive into <HI>Babylon,</HI> and of <HI>Ecclesiasticus,</HI> and the <HI>Wisdom of Solomon,</HI> which favours so much of the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> that he is yet in that Wisdom only, which is from beneath, which is Earthly, Animal, Deceitful, who doth not acknow|ledge the finger of God, writing those deep and precious Truths and Prae|dictions in the heart of him, whose hand was the Committer of them to

outward Writing (which whether it were not <HI>Solomon</HI> after whom it was so Entituled, <HI>Nil ultra quaero,</HI> he uttered 3000 <HI>Proverbs,</HI> whereof scarce 300 are extant in that Book of his Proverbs, some of which as standing inserted there in the <HI>Hebrew Text,</HI> are not the <HI>Original Copy,</HI> but a <HI>Transcript</HI> only at best out of that, or some Second hand <HI>Copies</HI> taken and Copied cut long after <HI>Solomons</HI> dayes by the men of <HI>Hezekiah</HI> 8 or 9 Generations from him, <HI>Prov.</HI> 25 1.

<P>The main Argument that ever I have seen against the <HI>divine Original</HI> of these Books, are, First, Their being not written in the <HI>Hebrew Tongue,</HI> which what a poor pedling piece of <HI>Disproof</HI> it is, he is no wiser then he should be, that does not see; for what warrant is there that all that was not Pen'd in the <HI>Hebrew Tongue</HI> is no Scripture of <HI>divine Inspiration?</HI> Or if there be, is it not as <HI>conclusive</HI> against much of the Scripture which <HI>I.O.</HI> counts <HI>Canonical,</HI> the whole of wch he reckons (at random) was wrote in the <HI>Hebrew Tongue,</HI> since its evident that much of that Book of <HI>Hester</HI> (9 Chap|ters and 3 Verses of which are set among the <HI>Canonical Scripture,</HI> and (oh the Wisdom) the other 6 Chapters and 10 Verses of the 10 Chapter by you self-will'd Choppers and Changers, because written in <HI>Greek</HI> are reckoned and rank'd with the <HI>Apocryphal</HI>) was written not in the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> but in the <HI>Caldee,</HI> as much of <HI>Ezra, Nehemiah,</HI> and <HI>Daniel</HI> also were.</P>
<P>And besides, if being written Originally in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> will avail toward the evincing of them to be <HI>Canonical,</HI> this will help some of your <HI>Apocrypha</HI> into your <HI>Canon,</HI> since that of <HI>Tobit</HI> or <HI>Tobias</HI> is not only (as that of <HI>Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uch</HI> also is, the <HI>Holy man</HI> that wrote much for that <HI>Prophet,</HI> and of that <HI>Prophecy</HI> of <HI>Ieremiah</HI>) most <HI>pretiously</HI> both <HI>Doctrinal</HI> and <HI>Prophetical,</HI> but also <HI>extant in the Hebrew</HI> as well as <HI>Greek and Latine</HI>; and that of <HI>Ecclesiasticus</HI> was writ|ten Originally in <HI>Hebrew,</HI> witnesse <HI>Iesus the Son of Syrach,</HI> who himself con|fesseth in his <HI>Prologue,</HI> he <HI>Translated</HI> it out of the <HI>Hebrew Text</HI>; and if ye say thats but a <HI>Translation</HI> then at best, and so not <HI>Canonical</HI> Scripture, I Reply Two things thereto;</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>First,</HI> This argues <HI>ad hominem</HI> against <HI>I O.</HI> then <HI>Tittles</HI> and <HI>Iotaes</HI> of the <HI>Hebrew Text</HI> are lost since the giving out thereof at first.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Secondly,</HI> That either <HI>Translation</HI> must be owned as <HI>Canonical</HI> with you, as well as the first <HI>Original Manuscripts</HI> and your <HI>Original Transcripts,</HI> or else it must be concluded what ever you <HI>Linguists</HI> have, yet the People that <HI>live</HI> upon your <HI>Lips,</HI> not being able to read <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Greek,</HI> have no <HI>Canoni|cal</HI> Scripture at all to read.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The Second Argument that is supposed to be of weight against the <HI>Di|vine Original</HI> of the <HI>Apocryphal</HI> Scriptures (<HI>Broughton,</HI> in his <HI>Sinai Sights,</HI> touches upon them both) is, <HI>because no</HI> Writers <HI>in the</HI> New Testament, <HI>Cite or Quote any of them any otherwise then they do Heathen Authors.</HI></P>
<P>But I marvel not, fith the <HI>wise men</HI> are to be <HI>befooled,</HI> that <HI>prudent Broughton</HI> should be so blind as not to see, how <HI>Paul,</HI> Heb. 1 3. quotes out of <HI>Wisd.</HI> 7.26.

<HI>Matth.</HI> 23.36, 37, 38. quotes 2 <HI>Esdras</HI> 1.30. And <HI>Rev.</HI> 7.9. answers to 2 <HI>Esdras</HI> 2.41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46. besides many other Passages in the Scrip|tures of the <HI>New</HI> Testament; but especially in the <HI>Revelation</HI> relate to their Paralels in that Second Book of <HI>Esdras,</HI> which is the Fourth at least of that man <HI>Ezra</HI> or <HI>Esdras</HI> his Writing, whereof that some should be received as of <HI>divine Original,</HI> and some that have as truly <HI>spiritual a Tincture</HI> on them, as the other, or any in all the Scripture ( as that Fourth of <HI>Esdras</HI> hath, wherein also he declares his <HI>Visions</HI> and <HI>Revelations</HI> he had from God, in which he would not sain and Lye (for then he were not fit to have his Two First Books owned as from God) should be rejected as meerly hu|mane, I see not any solid Ground for it; Yet such is the <HI>divine The-anthro|pical Wisdom</HI> of our meer humane <HI>Divines,</HI> that Two of that same mans Books, who wrote all the Four, (for the <HI>Identity</HI> of the Person, that Pen'd them all, every Believer may easily believe) are <HI>Canonized</HI> as <HI>divine,</HI> and the other Two <HI>Condemned</HI> as but <HI>humane.</HI></P>
<P>Thus though <HI>I.O.</HI> prates so much for the whole <HI>Book of Gods being provi|dentially preserved,</HI> so that we may <HI>have full assurance that we enjoy the whole</HI> Revelation <HI>of his Will</HI> (that is, with him, all the Writings that ever were written by Inspiration from the Spirit fit, to stand among those that he makes the Standard) in the <HI>Copies</HI> abiding amongst us; and contends that the whole Scripture entire, as given out from <HI>God</HI> without any losse of so much as one <HI>Letter, Tittle,</HI> or <HI>Iota,</HI> remains and is preserved in the <HI>Copies</HI> yet extant among us to this day; which is that Arch-Assertion in which ha|ving at first over shot himself in blindly bolting it out, rather then endure that honourable shame of owning his own <HI>Ignorance,</HI> he as blindly posts on to maintain, <HI>pag.</HI> 153.162.169.181.203. Yet upon I know not what fri|volous Conceits, and prejudicate Surmises possessing the minds of himself and his Brethren of both the Convocational and the Congregational way, among which blind Custome, more then clear sight, I believe to be none of the least, which are so far from enjoying the whole Book of Scripture, wherein the Mind and VVill of God lyes declared by his own Inspiration of the <HI>Penmen,</HI> that no small part of that Scripture that was written by men <HI>divinely inspired,</HI> and so <HI>providentially preserved,</HI> he refuses to enjoy or own as of such divine Descent from God, as other parts of the Scripture are, but Rejects and Contemnes it as <HI>Apocryphal,</HI> that is, so altogether hidden from him that he knows not very well what to make on't.</P>
<P>But suppose he should own and take all the <HI>Apocryphal</HI> Writings into his <HI>Standard</HI> and <HI>Canon</HI> (as he calls it) of the Scriptures, does that and all the rest both <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New,</HI> that are bound up in old <HI>English Bibles</HI> with it, Constitute the utmost Bounds of his <HI>Canon?</HI> Doth his <HI>Standard</HI> stand in so little room?

Is that the <HI>whole Book of God,</HI> the whole outward Declara|tion of his Will by the Writings of Holy men at his own motion? The whole Scripture entire that was ever so given out from God, without any losse of any of the <HI>Integral parts</HI> of it, so much as of one <HI>Letter, Tittle,</HI> or <HI>Iota?</HI> Is all Extant?

<P>To whom when I Replyed at the <HI>Dispute</HI> with him (as he there Relates) Thus, <HI>viz.</HI> If <HI>that Epistle was wriiten to the same end with those we have (as it was,</HI> viz. <HI>to Instruct the</HI> Corinthians <HI>how to carry themselves to grosse Sinners,</HI> I <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.9. compared with <HI>vers.</HI> II. <HI>I wrote unto you not to Company, and now I have written unto you not to keep Company</HI>; And the same was said of his First to the <HI>Ephesians,</HI> i.e. that it was to the self same End as that we have, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 3.3. As <HI>I wrote before, that ye may understand my Knowledge in the Mi|stery of Christ so now) then 'twas intended as much for a</HI> Rule <HI>as the o|ther; But it was Written to the same End:</HI> Ergo, <HI>If one a</HI> Rule, <HI>then the other.</HI></P>
<P><HI>T.D.</HI> Denies the Consequence; Saying <HI>Sermons, private Religious Dis|courses have the same common End with the written Scriptures, yet the Later only are our standing Rule; the former our Rule but so far as they agree with the</HI> Later <HI>in the</HI> Scripture.</P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> Which Reply of <HI>T.D's,</HI> is so unreasonably ridiculcus, that he is
<PB N="86" REF="158">
scarce <HI>Animal Rationale Risibile,</HI> that receives, and entertains it <HI>seriously</HI> as the <HI>Truth</HI>;</P>
<P>For <HI>First,</HI> it supposes as if <HI>Pauls</HI> First writing to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> were not Written <HI>Scriptures,</HI> as well as the Rest we have, but an <HI>Orall</HI> Dis|course.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> It supposes <HI>Pau's</HI> First Epistle of all to that Church, which was cited by himself in his Second, as written to the same End, and was writ|ten in the same Spirit of God in which he lived, and walk'd, and out of whose movings he wrote no <HI>Epistles</HI> to the Churches, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Though this I consesse, which makes little for</HI> J.O. <HI>but much against him, where he talks, as one that meddles with whats out of his reach, of Gods putting every word so into their mouths, and speaking by them in every Tittle they wrote, that somethings in</HI> Pauls <HI>Wri|tings he</HI> (as himself sayes) <HI>spake; and not the Lord,</HI> 1 Cor. 7.12.</NOTE> was fit to stand in no other Account then the Ser|mons, and private Religious Dis|courses of our Clergy-men and their Common Christians, which must stand or fall as they square, or not square with the <HI>Standard of</HI> Scrip|ture; And as if the <HI>Seniour</HI> Epistles of <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Corinth</HI> and <HI>Ephesus,</HI> must like <HI>Prisoners</HI> at the <HI>Bar,</HI> receive their Sentence of <HI>Guilty,</HI> or <HI>not Guilty, worthy</HI> or <HI>not worthy</HI> to be <HI>owned</HI> as a part of the <HI>Rule</HI> or <HI>Canon,</HI> by their <HI>Iuniours,</HI> or such as were sent after them, to sit as <HI>Iudges</HI> of them at the <HI>Bench</HI>; And so hereby his Reply is as it were an <HI>Affirmative Answer</HI> to the <HI>First</HI> of my <HI>Four Queries,</HI> viz. That <HI>Pauls</HI> Wri|tings were not all alike of <HI>Divine Original</HI> and <HI>Inspiration,</HI> but some <HI>Epistles</HI> to the <HI>Churches</HI> of his, were uttered as he was moved by the Holy Spirit, <GAP DESC="foreign">, and others <GAP DESC="foreign">, of <HI>private Interpretation,</HI> or as private Mens Writings. <HI>Credat Apella.</HI></P>
<P>And when 'twas urged by me, that there was no more <HI>evidence</HI> or <HI>Character</HI> of these <HI>Epistles</HI> being a <HI>Rule</HI> which are, then of those which are not in your Books; Then <HI>T.D.</HI> seeing what he had Replyed that way would not hold, Replyes by way of Answer to the <HI>Second</HI> of my <HI>Four</HI> last <HI>Queries,</HI> affirming that <HI>Pauls</HI> first Writings to <HI>Corinth</HI> and <HI>Ephesus</HI> were <HI>lost</HI> when those we have are <HI>saved</HI>; and so makes this distinction of the ones being <HI>perished,</HI> the other <HI>preserved</HI> by Gods Providence watching over them, when he did not over the other a <HI>signal Evidence</HI> that God intended the one for a <HI>standing Rule</HI> to us and not the other; and herein he and <HI>I.O.</HI> Jump together and border pretty near one another, sith <HI>I.O.</HI> insists exceedingly (as an Argu|ment of their being a <HI>Rule</HI> in the Church) on this businesse of Gods <HI>preser|vation of every</HI> Tittle <HI>and</HI> Iota <HI>of divinely Inspired</HI> Scripture <HI>to this day,</HI> where|by he <HI>implicitly</HI> denies all the afore-named, that are not in your <HI>Bibles,</HI> to be any of them of Divine <HI>Inspiration</HI>; But with this Difference from <HI>T.D.</HI> that <HI>I.O.</HI> sayes not a <HI>Tittle</HI> of the <HI>Inspired</HI> Scripture is lost; <HI>T.D.</HI> to the con|futing of <HI>I.O.</HI> Confesses (being I believe informed of some Holy Scrip|ture at the Dispute, which he knew not of before) that not only <HI>Tittles</HI> and <HI>Iotaes,</HI> but some whole <HI>Books</HI> of which he dares not say expresly (though intimate it he doth in the Head next above spoken to) that they were not <HI>Divinely Inspired,</HI> are lost and perished out of the World; So that the Preservation of what is Preserved, is made a Signal Token that
<PB N="87" REF="158">
its to be our Rule, and the losse of whats lost, that that was not written for such an end.</P>
<P>To which <HI>Signal Token</HI> of Gods intending the One and not the O. her for A Rule, when I Replyed (as 'tis transiently done above to <HI>I O.</HI> touching the Books called <HI>Apocrypha</HI>) that there is more Antient Holy Writ remain|ing <HI>extant to this day, preserved for our use by Gods Providence,</HI> then ye own or honour with a standing in your <HI>Standard</HI> (instancing in the Epistle of <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Laodicea</HI>) then by and by <HI>T.D.</HI> who rides the Rounds not much lesse then <HI>I.O.</HI> and is never <HI>positive</HI> nor <HI>steady</HI> to any thing he Asserts, so as to stand long to it without shifting (<HI>Proteus</HI> like) into another shape, when he is ashamed to be seen longer in his old one, comes out in a clear contrary <HI>Gelour,</HI> and flatly contradicts himself, and unsayes what he said but just be|fore; And whereas he had made the preserving of what was written, and is preserved, an Argument of its being <HI>designed of God for a Rule,</HI> affirms, That all that was written by Holy Men (meaning <HI>Paul</HI> among the rest, or else he speaks not at all to the purpose) and <HI>preserved also for our use, is not therefore our standing Rule:</HI> Thus <HI>one while 'tis so,</HI> and <HI>one while no</HI>; then <HI>nei|ther,</HI> yet <HI>both no, and so.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pauls</HI> Three Epistles, <HI>viz.</HI> the Two to <HI>Corinth,</HI> One to <HI>Ephesus</HI> that we have, appear <HI>therefore to be our standing Rule, because they are preserved to our use to this day</HI>; but <HI>his</HI> first of all to <HI>Corinth</HI> and <HI>Ephesus, therefore not</HI> so, <HI>because not</HI> preserved; theres his first saying.</P>
<P>His very next of all is this, <HI>Pauls</HI> Epistle to <HI>Laodicea, though preserved</HI> for our use, <HI>yet is not therefore to be our standing Rule to this day.</HI></P>
<P>So what ever <HI>Pauls</HI> Epistles are, yet I am sure <HI>Pauls</HI> Life and <HI>Example</HI> is no <HI>Rule</HI> that <HI>T.D's.</HI> walks by, nor <HI>I.O.</HI> neither, for his <HI>yea was yea,</HI> and his <HI>nay nay</HI>; he did not use such <HI>lightnesse,</HI> as they both very often do, who say <HI>nay</HI> to that they said <HI>yea</HI> to just before; neither did he speak so accor|ding to the Flesh (as they) with whom now theres <HI>yea yea,</HI> and anon to the same thing <HI>nay nay</HI>; but as God is true, and Christ is not <HI>yea</HI> and <HI>nay</HI> in his words, and enjoynes us to be steady in our <HI>yea</HI> and <HI>nay,</HI> so was <HI>Pauls</HI> word in what he spake.</P>
<P>And yet the <HI>Reason T.D.</HI> renders of his saying <HI>No,</HI> to what he said <HI>not No</HI> but <HI>so</HI> just before, is as <HI>Reasonlesse</HI> as his self Confutation is; for (mark) then (quoth he) <HI>If what ere was written by Holy men</HI> (alluding to <HI>Paul) be therefore our standing Rule because preserved, the Discourses of Holy Ministers in former and latter times should be our Rule, which they are not, but are to be brought to the written Word as our Rule and Test.</HI></P>
<P>In which if by Holy Ministers in former times, he means <HI>Paul</HI> among the rest, as he must, else he misses the matter, then some of <HI>Pauls Epistles</HI> are the <HI>Rule</HI> and <HI>Test,</HI> which his other <HI>Epistles</HI> must stand bare before to be tryed by, which is absurd; If by latter Ministers he intend such as himself, who Confesses his Ministry to be <HI>fallible</HI>; I would have him to know, and that he shall find more of anon, that <HI>Pauls Ministry,</HI> and every <HI>true Ministry</HI> that <HI>Ministers</HI> by word of Mouth or Writing, as moved by the Holy Spirit, which moves and leads none <HI>fallibly,</HI> but all <HI>infallibly,</HI> whom it leads, was no such <HI>fal|lible Ministry</HI> as his false one is, that it need be tryed by his other own holy Writings.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="159">But now as to the <HI>Epistle</HI> of <HI>Laodicea</HI> instanced in, <HI>T.D.</HI> was so hard of belief, and difficult to he perswaded that there was any such at all, that if one of <HI>Sandwich</HI> had not stood up and said he had the Book wherein we Asserted it to be Printed, we should hardly have gained so much Credit among the Clergy then present (such <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con</HI> they made about it, as to have been believed) that there was such a thing in Being; so ignorant are they of some present parts of that <HI>Scripture</HI> they call their <HI>Rule</HI>; yet at last 'twas yielded such a one was extant.</P>
<P>But for all that, <HI>T.D.</HI> who has ever more wayes then one into the <HI>Wood</HI> where he loves to wander, when he is <HI>bedged</HI> out of it one way, will find or make himself a <HI>Gap</HI> into it by another, and as to this matter of <HI>PAVL</HI> to <HI>LAODICEA,</HI> he hath Three or Four shifts, for fear one fail, affirming after he had found it Translated into <HI>English,</HI> not <HI>to,</HI> but <HI>from Laodicea</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Though I affirm it is not from</HI> Lao|dicea, <HI>were it truly rendered, being</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, Col. 4.16. <HI>which</HI> Arias Montanus <HI>renders more rightly,</HI> Quae est <HI>Laodicensium,</HI> or Quae est <HI>Laodi|ceae,</HI> the <HI>Epistle which belongs to the</HI> Laodiceans, <HI>or is of, or to</HI> Laodicea.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That <HI>for ought we know, it might be that</HI> First of <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Timothy, the</HI> Post-script <HI>of which sayes it was Written from</HI> Laodicea; of which <HI>Post-script</HI> (which its notorious e|nough to every Novice, that neither it, nor the other <HI>Post-scripts</HI> were Pen'd by such as wrote the Epistles them|selves) when I Asked <HI>T.D.</HI> Whether he owned it and the Rest as <HI>Canonical,</HI> or no? <HI>As Canonical</HI> (quoth he) <HI>for ought appears yet to me, as your Epistle to the Laodiceans,</HI> of which Epistle yet he had said but just before, It might be that of <HI>Pauls</HI> to <HI>Timothy,</HI> which yet that it was, is so unlikely, that tis little lesse then to be like a Child to Assert it; A likely matter indeed that its <HI>Pauls</HI> to <HI>Timothy</HI> meant <HI>Col.</HI> 4.16. That which <HI>Paul</HI> wrote to <HI>Timothy</HI> was to <HI>Timothy</HI> a particular Person, about particular Matters concerning him, as in that Capacity of a <HI>Church-Officer,</HI> I Tim. 3.14, 15. What should he Charge the <HI>Colosians</HI> so much to look after that for? Or if he had, Would he not have said, See that ye read the Epistle to <HI>Timothy</HI>? Had not that been plainer?</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> But seeing that Snap, <HI>T.D.</HI> fits another <HI>string</HI> to his <HI>Instrument,</HI> and then <HI>Fidles</HI> on in this <HI>fashion,</HI> denying it to be <HI>Pauls Epistle</HI> at all, either to <HI>Laodicea,</HI> or <HI>Timothy,</HI> or any one else; branding it with the Name of one of the <HI>Brats</HI> laid by the <HI>Popish party</HI> at the <HI>Apostles</HI> doors, which they will not <HI>Father,</HI> and me as a <HI>Brother</HI> of the Popish party, and an Abbet|tor of them in their wickednesse, for <HI>Fathering</HI> it on <HI>Paul</HI> at all.</P>
<P>And then <HI>Thirdly,</HI> That he might seem to say <HI>something,</HI> though no bet|ter then <HI>nothing</HI> to <HI>every thing,</HI> rather then own <HI>any thing</HI> for Truth before the World, be it never so plain, that the <HI>Quakers</HI> tell him, he bethinks him|self, and upon Second, or rather Third Thoughts, adds (having perused the Judgement of some Learned men about it) that 'twas neither <HI>Pauls</HI> to <HI>Timothy</HI> any more then to <HI>Laodicea,</HI> nor yet altogether such a <HI>Brat,</HI> or Ba|stard brood as a metr <HI>Chimaera</HI> hatcht, and bred, and sained in the Fancies only of the <HI>Popish party,</HI> but at least a <HI>Real Epistle,</HI> yet one that was so far from being <HI>Pauls</HI> to <HI>Laodicea,</HI> that it was rather one Written by the <HI>Laodi|ceans</HI>

<P N="2">2. <HI>Iohn</HI> speaking that all the <HI>Signs</HI> Christ did, were not <HI>written,</HI> is no Argument to prove that all that was <HI>Written</HI> by <HI>the Spirit,</HI> was not as <HI>equally useful</HI> as some of it, and all alike designed and ordered to the same Ends, so that if some were intended for a <HI>Rule,</HI> the rest must be; yea, faith not the Scripture thus, <HI>Rom.</HI> 15.4. 1 Cor. 18.11. <HI>Whatever was Written afore|time was Written for our Instruction, that we by it might have Hope</HI>; Saith it not, <HI>All</HI> Scripture (<GAP DESC="foreign">) <HI>is profitable for Doctrine, Exhortation, Instruction in Righteousnesse, &amp;c.</HI> 2 Tim 3.16. &amp; 2 Pet. 1.20.

<P>I understand not therefore the force of this Argument of <HI>T. D.</HI></P>
<Q><P><HI>All</HI> that was done, was not Written:</P>
<P><HI>Therefore</HI> much of that which was Written is of no use, or not intended to the same use to the Church as the rest was.</P></Q>
<P N="3">3. It perfectly confirms against <HI>T.

<P>One thing more I must not let slip here, though <HI>T. D.</HI> did in his Account of the Dispute, <HI>viz.</HI> That when <HI>T.D.</HI> had no more to say against that Argu|ment from <HI>Paul</HI>: Epistle to the <HI>Laodiceans,</HI> one of his Associated Assistants; <HI>R. Wilkinson,</HI> asked, Whether we had more Scripture in the <HI>Greek Tongue</HI> now extant, then is in their <HI>Greek Testaments</HI>? For that to <HI>Laodicea</HI> being here but <HI>Englished</HI> it would not down with them. <HI>Reply</HI> was made, <HI>Yea</HI>; so naming a Verse between the 5 and 6 Verses of the 6 Chapter of <HI>Luke,</HI> which is in some <HI>Greek</HI> Copies, not theirs, (and a Verse of the Original Text wanting, makes still against <HI>I. O.'s Arch-Assertion</HI>; of the Scripture of both <HI>Testaments</HI> remaining in the Copies they now have entire to a Tittle, as it first given out without any losse, <HI>pag.</HI> 173.) I repeated it in <HI>English</HI> thus out of the <HI>Greek</HI>; in which <HI>Greek</HI> Tongue I have also read it; <HI>Iesus seeing a certain man Working on the Sabbath day, said unto him, O man, If thou knewest indeed what thou dost, thou were happy; but if thou knowest not, thou art accursed, and a Transgressor of the Law.</HI></P>
<P>And so I have proved against <HI>T. D.</HI> That there's much <HI>Scripture</HI> of Holy men, which was as much designed in its first giving out to be the <HI>Rule,</HI> as
<PB N="92" REF="161">

<P><HI>I O.</HI> Pag: 319. <HI>Neither the Care of God over his</HI> Truth, <HI>nor the fidelity of the</HI> Judaical Church <HI>will permit us to entertain the least</HI> Suspition <HI>that there was ever in the World any</HI> Copy <HI>of the</HI> Bible <HI>differing in the least from that which we enjoy, or that those we have are corrupted, as is pretended; the</HI> Authors <HI>of that</HI> Insinuation <HI>cannot produce the least</HI> Testimony <HI>to make it good.</HI> And <HI>pag.</HI> 317. <HI>Let the</HI> Authors <HI>of this</HI> Insinuation <HI>prove the Assertion; Name'y,</HI> That there was ever in the World any other Copy of the <HI>Bible</HI> differing in any <HI>one Word</HI> from those we now enjoy: <HI>Let them produce one</HI> Testimony, <HI>one</HI> Au|thor <HI>of</HI> Credit, Jew <HI>or</HI> Christian, <HI>that</HI> can <HI>or</HI> doth <HI>speak one Word to this pur|pose: Let</HI> them <HI>direct us to any</HI> Relick, <HI>any</HI> Monument, <HI>and kind of</HI> Remem|brance of them, <HI>and not put us off with weak</HI> Conjectures, <HI>&amp;c. and it shall be of</HI> weight <HI>with us:</HI> And Epist. pag. 27, 28. <HI>We evidently find</HI> various Le|ctions <HI>n the</HI> Greek Copies <HI>which we enjoy, and so</HI> grant <HI>that which</HI> Ocular In|spection <HI>evinces to be</HI> true; <HI>yet none of</HI> them <HI>are able to</HI> shew out <HI>of any</HI> Copies yet Extant <HI>in the World, or that</HI> they can <HI>make appear</HI> ever to have been Ex|tant, <HI>that ever there were any such</HI> various Lections <HI>in the Originals of the</HI> Old Testament.</P>
<P>And so I come to take my leave of <HI>T.D.</HI> again for a while till I meet him again (as I must do where he meets in one with <HI>I.O.</HI> in many other places) and return to walk on a while with <HI>I.

<P>Besides 'tis evident, that <HI>Esdras</HI> and his Companions, if the <HI>Consigration and Bounding</HI> of the <HI>Canon</HI> were in their dayes, or by their <HI>Sanydrim</HI> set a work, and ordered by the insallible Spirit of God therein, wrote a number more of Books, 2 <HI>Esdras</HI> 14. 42. 44. then are now Extant in your <HI>Bibles,</HI> which if all lost, it makes against <HI>I.O.</HI> still, that sayes not an <HI>Apex</HI> of what was by divine inspiration, is lost; and so his great Engine out of which he shoots short against the Truth, his Standard and <HI>Canon</HI> comes still <HI>lame,</HI> and <HI>short,</HI> and <HI>halting</HI> home. And also though <HI>Esdras</HI> and his <HI>Company</HI> Compiled
<PB N="95" REF="162">
many, yet the last Volume of the <HI>Psalmes</HI> is more credibly supposed, if I would enter into <HI>I.

O's</HI> side.</P>
<P>And as to the newer and later Scripture since Christ, where is the least touch of such a businesse of <HI>Constituting</HI> some few certain Books of those many more then we have, which were then written, into a <HI>Canon,</HI> and dis|carding othersome, whether such as we want, or such <HI>legitimate</HI> ones as we have, as that to <HI>Laodicea</HI> from within the <HI>Coasts</HI> and <HI>Quarters</HI> of your <HI>Canon</HI>? Nay, rather the Scripture of the <HI>New</HI> sayes, as in the places above Cited, <HI>Rom.</HI> 15.4. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.11. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.16.17. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.20.21. That all Scriptures that are <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>given,</HI> or <HI>written</HI> by <HI>Inspiration</HI> of old time, were to the same purpose that any at all were; so that if any of it all, then all of it is to be listed into that <HI>Lydium Lapidem,</HI> and to be Confede|rate with the rest, and to come by right into the Confines of your <HI>Canon,</HI> all what ever was so written being alike written for our Instruction, alike profitable, alike publick, and none of it of a more private Interpretation then the rest; Does that of <HI>T. D's.</HI> Citing, and <HI>I. O's.</HI> also, <HI>Ex.</HI> 3. 26. (viz.) <HI>Iob.</HI> 20.30.31. prove any such thing? If that be Exclusive of a|ny Scripture at all, it must be of all that which was written after it; foras|much as, according to <HI>T. Ds.</HI> Exposition of it, it intimates a sufficiency in that which was already written; and (if weel be befool'd with his sinister senses, and mindlesse meanings on the Scripture) that when he had writ|ten that, there was as much as God himself thought sufficient to be written at all as a rule of Faith, or in order to mens beleeving, <HI>pag.</HI> 28. <HI>These are Written that ye might be'eeve, and have Life</HI>; as if he should say, Here's e|nough, what need more?

On this account, as one might Interpret <HI>Solomon,</HI> as cutting off from the <HI>Canon</HI> all the Prophets Writings that succeeded his in the Old Testament Scrip|ture; so one must Interpret <HI>Iohn</HI> as Excluding out of the <HI>Standard</HI> of the New Testament all ensuing Writings of Holy men but his own, and his own Epistles and Revelation also, which were <HI>Posterior,</HI> or <HI>Successive</HI> to his History then in hand, as utterly uselesse and superfluous. <HI>Credat Apelia.</HI></P>
<P>Doth that <HI>Gal.</HI> 6. 16 As <HI>many as walk according to this Rule, or</HI> Canon, <HI>do it?</HI> which blind Guides and People so hastily patter over, as if that men|tioned the <HI>whole Bible</HI> and all that Writing, and not a Tittle more then whats bound up in it, besides the <HI>Apocrypha</HI>; when I shall shew in its pro|per place, its spoken of no External Scripture of Writing at all; I say, will that prove <HI>some</HI> to be <HI>Authorized</HI> of <HI>God</HI> for the <HI>Standard,</HI> and some even of the same Holy mens Writings though yet extant, not to be so? Is there a|ny such distinction in the sound of that Term [<HI>This Rule</HI>] whereby (if it were meant of Scripture, as its nothing lesse) to give us to discern that

<HI>Paul</HI> in that Expression includes his Two Epistles to <HI>Corinth,</HI> and that one to <HI>Ephesus</HI> and this to <HI>Galatia,</HI> and the rest of his own and other Apostles Writings, even the <HI>Revelation</HI> it self, that was not wrote in his dayes, that are Concincinated in your Copies as intended of God to be the <HI>Standard,</HI> and excludes his first to <HI>Corinth,</HI> his first to <HI>Ephesus,</HI> and that to <HI>Laodicea,</HI> as not intended of God to stand in the Standard, but to stand below it to be tryed, and judged by it?</P>

<P>And now I am upon that Term of thine <HI>I. O.

<P>Take but a Review <HI>I.O.</HI> of some few of <HI>thy Thoughts</HI> upon these two matters, and thou wilt discern, if thou be not blinded, that all the World may see thy overlashing <HI>Positions (viz.</HI> That the points are <HI>coaevous</HI> with the first <HI>manuscripts,</HI> and that the <HI>Text remains intirely the same</HI> in your <HI>Transcripts</HI> as at first <HI>giving out, without any losse, alteration</HI> or <HI>corruption to a Tittle</HI>) are <HI>supported</HI> with no more then <HI>solely thy suppositions.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>FIrst, for the <HI>Punctation,</HI> what positively thou affirmest of it in a Note above <HI>Ela,</HI> is to be seen in thy <HI>Epist.</HI> Pag. 19. 20. 25. and in thy <HI>Book</HI> Pag. 211. 216. 220. 225. 294. and throwout the whole Four and Five Chapters of thy <HI>Second Treatise</HI>: At present, wee'l see how <HI>piteously</HI> thou <HI>underproppest</HI> thy <HI>Opinion</HI> about it with the putting in of thy meer <HI>Imaginations</HI> to other mens, and not to say <HI>Imposing,</HI> but <HI>Opposing</HI> thy <HI>Suppositions,</HI> taken from the meer <HI>suppositions</HI> of such Learned <HI>Authors</HI> as thou sidest with, against the (more solidly) grounded <HI>suppositions</HI> of such as were, are, and are confessed by thy self to be <HI>Learned,</HI> as well as they: and how thou confessest thou Answerst one <HI>Conjecture</HI> no otherwise then with another, and standst thrusting with thy <HI>weak, wonted Weapon</HI> of (<HI>Shall we Think</HI>) Pag. 168. against others strong <HI>Arguments</HI> to the contrary.</P>
<P>First, It is urged, and that with no little shew of Truth, that the old <HI>Hebrew Letters being those the</HI> Samaritan Pentateuch <HI>is written with at this
<PB N="106" REF="168">
day, and that the</HI> Samaritan Letters <HI>having alwayes been, and still being with|out</HI> Points, <HI>it must follow that the</HI> Points <HI>are an Invention and Innovation of a later date then the change of the</HI> Letters, <HI>which was not till</HI> Ezraes <HI>dayes,</HI> and <HI>not Goaeuous</HI> with the first Scripture, <HI>Pag.</HI> 260. in which the <HI>Consequence</HI> being undeniable, thou makest bold to <HI>think</HI> the <HI>Antecedent</HI> may be false; and among a deal more of <HI>doubtful stuffe</HI> to say, that <HI>'tis most uncertain when,</HI> and in <HI>what Character the</HI> Samaritans <HI>received the</HI> Pentateuch, <HI>P.</HI> 261. &amp; that the <HI>Letters thereof were the Antient</HI> Hebrew Letters: As for what <HI>Eusebius, Hierom,</HI> and <HI>some of the</HI> Rabbins <HI>Report, it seems to thee on the best Enquiry thou art able to make a groundlesse Tradition and meer sable, because though</HI> Eusebius <HI>affirmed it was so affirmed, yet tells not on what ground</HI>; And <HI>though</HI> Hierom <HI>himself be positive in it, yet he might be mistaken in this as well as he was in some other things like to it,</HI> as Pag. 234. he <HI>saw not all things; and that the</HI> Tal|mud <HI>is of no weight with thee.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> What pedling Disproof is here of <HI>I.O.</HI> pushing against Two <HI>Antient Fathers</HI> Positions, and the Testimony of the whole <HI>Talmud</HI> of the <HI>Rabbins,</HI> with no more then the <HI>Bean-stalk</HI> of his own <HI>Suppositions</HI> and <HI>slender Sayings,</HI> It's <HI>of no weight with me</HI>; It <HI>seems to me a Tradition,</HI> pag 262. and, It <HI>doth not appear to me, whence this Change of Character should arise</HI>; The Jewes <HI>are thought, and said in the</HI> Captivity <HI>to have forgot their own Character, and learn'd the</HI> Caldean, <HI>so as to adhere to it in their Return, but that the men of one Age should forget the use of their own</HI> Letters <HI>is incredible.</HI></P>
<P>Yet say I more then Credible; yea, certain it is, that though the Anti|ents alive at the burning of the First, and building of the Second Temple, did not likely forget their own, yet in and after the Captivity the <HI>Chal|dean Character</HI> was used, witnesse the Books of <HI>Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah, Ester,</HI> in which much is written in <HI>Chaldee</HI>; I say then, what <HI>straw</HI> and <HI>stubble,</HI> and <HI>unsteady stuffe</HI> is all this, which our <HI>Doctoral Students</HI> in <HI>Divini|ty</HI> stand so upon as to <HI>stiffen</HI> themselves by it against each other in their <HI>sturdy</HI> Disputes about their <HI>stupidities</HI>? yet so far are solid Saints from put|ting any <HI>stresse,</HI> much more so much as <HI>I.O.</HI> who states and trusts no lesse then whole <HI>sacred Truth</HI> thereon, upon such <HI>Ticklish Pinnacles</HI> and <HI>Points,</HI> or from strengthning themselves in their Faith towards God thereby, that its even a <HI>stink</HI> to them to see any so senslesse, as so to do, on either hand, <HI>Pag.</HI> 263.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Argument for the <HI>Novelty of the Points</HI> from the <HI>Antient Iudai|cal Coines found with</HI> Samaritan Characters <HI>upon them, is refel'd</HI> with the Rush of thy own ridiculous and reasonlesse Fancies; which sith they are too frivolous to Rehearse, I refer the Reader, that is minded to be so foolish as to follow thee in that <HI>high Road</HI> (as thy self there callst it, and so savest me the labour of sprinkling it into that Name) of <HI>Forgeries</HI> and <HI>Fables,</HI> in which thy self, as well as those <HI>thy Opponents</HI> are altogether, to <HI>Pag.</HI> 264, 265, 266, 267. where he may Read thee Rendring of <HI>simple Supposition</HI> a|gainst <HI>Supposition,</HI> or rather against <HI>Position,</HI> disproving <HI>Ignotum per magis ignotum, dubium per magis dubium,</HI> pelting back out of thy <HI>Pot-gun</HI> such <HI>brown Paper</HI> as this at the <HI>Probable</HI> Arguments of others, <HI>(viz.) May we not think, &amp;c.</HI> It <HI>is not improbable that it was so old,</HI> nor is it <HI>improbable
<PB N="107" REF="168">
that 'twas so, &amp;c. I cannot think the Greeks of old used only the Vncial</HI> Let|ters, <HI>which yet we know some did, &amp;c. I shall crave leave to Answer this Con|jecture with another, and grant that such a Change was made,</HI> yet <HI>this prejudices not them in the least, who affirm</HI> Ezra, and the men of the Great Congrega|tion, <HI>to have been the</HI> Authors <HI>of the Points; Nay, it casts a</HI> probability <HI>on the other hand, namely, That</HI> Ezra <HI>laying aside the</HI> Old Letters, <HI>because of their dif|ficulty, together with the other introduced the</HI> Points, <HI>to facilitate their use.</HI></P>
<P>And Lastly, To bring up the <HI>Reerward</HI> of thy manifold Fictions foisted out against the urgings of that probable Proof from the <HI>Characters</HI> upon the <HI>Coines,</HI> after thou hadst prosecuted them a while <HI>passim testaque lutoque,</HI> thou Concludest thus, <HI>viz. Now let any man Iudge from this heap of Vncer|tainties</HI> (of which say I <HI>I.O's.</HI> there accumulated, are I know not how many, to one of the other) <HI>any thing can arise with the face of a witnesse to be admitted to give Testimony</HI>; on either hand, say I, much lesse on <HI>I.O's.</HI> whose own heap of confessed uncertain Conjectures is manifold more Massy, then that of his <HI>Antagonists,</HI> yea, as weighty as the very <HI>Wind</HI> it self.</P>
<P>He that <HI>will part with his Possession on such easie Terms</HI> (quoth <HI>I.O.</HI> there) <HI>never found much benefit by it.</HI></P>
<P>And, say I, He that will part with much Labour and Pains to find out the <HI>Antiquity</HI> of this <HI>Possession</HI> of <HI>Hebrew Letters, Points</HI> and <HI>Tittles,</HI> and think to get much benefit by purchasing it to himself therewith, as <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch</HI> and <HI>Ancient an Inheritance,</HI> as <HI>I. O.</HI> pretends it is, <HI>Pag.</HI> 252. 318. and as <HI>many Millions</HI> as he sayes <HI>Pag.</HI> 176. <HI>look'd on,</HI> and <HI>enjoyed it for many Ages as their chiefest Treasure,</HI> Pag. 163. he shall assuredly have his labour for his pains.</P>
<P>And if I may crave leave to interpose so far as to Answer <HI>I.O's.</HI> many <HI>uncertain Ones,</HI> with one more certain Conjecture, I tell <HI>I O.</HI> that he hath himself <HI>Conjectured away</HI> the very thing he <HI>Conjectured for,</HI> and tost his own Cause so long to and fro among the multitude of his <HI>uncertain Thoughts, Conjectures,</HI> and <HI>Suppositions,</HI> till unawares to himself, in the Crowd there|of, he hath lost it altogether, and supposed it into the very <HI>bosom</HI> of his <HI>Opponents</HI>; for if <HI>Ezra,</HI> and his <HI>Congregation</HI> were the <HI>Authors</HI> of the Points, and introduced them (as he sayes the Argument from the Cha|racters on the Coines renders it probable that they did, <HI>Pag.</HI> 266, as is a|bovesaid) then <HI>proculdubio,</HI> for <HI>certain</HI> and of a Truth it may both be Conjectured, and must be <HI>credibly</HI> and <HI>infallibly</HI> believed, that they are so far from being <HI>Coaevous</HI> with the first <HI>Manuscripts,</HI> that they were invented and introduced (though before the <HI>Tiberian Massorites</HI>) yet after all that he owns as the <HI>Canonical Scripture</HI> of the <HI>Old Testament</HI> was first written; and so he gives it in for granted that they are a <HI>Novelty,</HI> and not a thing that was from the beginning of the <HI>Scripture,</HI> which is that he is to prove, or else it comes short of his purpose, so as to adde an inch to his <HI>Arch Asser|tion</HI> of a <HI>non Alteration of the Text,</HI> as at first given out in any Tittle, and so, as if he had not, in <HI>Pag.</HI> 211. to the contradicting of his own meer <HI>Con|jecture</HI> and <HI>Conceit</HI> of their <HI>Coaevousnesse</HI> with the <HI>immediate Manuscripts,</HI> said thus, <HI>I no wayes doubt, but as we now enjoy the</HI> Points, <HI>we shall manifest that
<PB N="108" REF="169">
they were compleated by</HI> Ezra <HI>and his</HI> Companions, <HI>and so confounded himself e|nough; he hath by this Reiteration of the same self-confuting.</HI> Conjecture about the Points, overthrown himself as to that Point altogether the first Wri|ting of the <HI>Pentateuch,</HI> being by his own Confession, <HI>Pag.</HI> 5. a thousand years elder then <HI>Ezra,</HI> and according to himself all the rest both <HI>written</HI> and <HI>lost</HI> before <HI>Ezra</HI> the Scribe and his fellows dayes, who he makes but the <HI>Transcribers</HI> and <HI>Restorers</HI> of them; <HI>So Pag.</HI> 27. out of <HI>Azarias</HI> he ascribes the <HI>Figure</HI> and <HI>Character</HI> of the <HI>Points</HI> to <HI>Ezra,</HI> and the <HI>restoration of their use to the Massorites</HI>; Whether then the <HI>Points</HI> be from <HI>Ezra,</HI> or the <HI>Tiberian Massorites,</HI> is much at one to the Root and Bottom of thy busi|nesse <HI>I. O.</HI> which is to evince, that the Text stands entirely the same in your <HI>Pointed Copies</HI> to a <HI>Tittle, without variation from what it was, when first Written,</HI> and that <HI>the Points are Coaevou with the</HI> Scripture <HI>it self</HI>: And thou talkst that according to the general belief of the Jewes they are (if not from <HI>Moses,</HI> yet) at least from <HI>Ezra,</HI> not <HI>denying the use and knowledge of them received a great reviving by the Massorites,</HI> when <HI>they had been much dis|used,</HI> Pag. 247. from which <HI>Massorites</HI> yet (for ought thou <HI>clearly,</HI> or any more but <HI>Conjecturally,</HI> and very <HI>uncertainly</HI> makst appear to the contrary) they might as well receive their first being, according to the Testimony of <HI>Elias Levita</HI> who (as thy self sayest, <HI>Pag.</HI> 248.) <HI>was the most learned Grammarian of the Iewes in his Age, and Assistant to</HI> Paulus Fagius <HI>in his noble promotion of the</HI> Hebrew Tongue; and the <HI>Testimonies</HI> of <HI>Luther,</HI> the renownedst Reformer, in his time, as ever <HI>Europe</HI> had, and of <HI>Zainglius</HI> and others then that imbraced his Opinion, and of <HI>Capellus</HI> whom thou stilest a <HI>Learned Protestant Divine</HI>; and of that Learned Professor, Dr. <HI>Iohn Prideaux</HI> in his <HI>Publick Lecture</HI> at the <HI>Vespers</HI> of your own <HI>Oxonian Co|unitia,</HI> on that Subject; which Dr. <HI>I.P.</HI> its no disparagement to Dr. <HI>I.O.</HI> to Confesse to have been in his time far before himself, as to <HI>Schoole Divi|nity,</HI> though we know that <HI>O.</HI> stands preferred a little before <HI>P.</HI> in the Horn-book, <HI>Pag.</HI> 15, 16, 17, 18 of thy <HI>Epist.</HI></P>
<P>And to <HI>Capellus</HI> his Argument that '<HI>twas likely.</HI> Elias <HI>spake on Principles of Conviction of Truth, because against the common interest of all his People, which seems to have weight in it,</HI> how pedlingly thou <HI>Replyest</HI> and <HI>Pelletest</HI> out thy <HI>Putations</HI> to the contrary, Pag. 248, 249, 250. a very Boy may behold; the most material of which is this, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>the Testimony of this one</HI> Elias <HI>should be able to out-weigh the constant Attestation of all the learned</HI> Jewes <HI>to the contrary, as</HI> Capellus <HI>pleads,</HI> and <HI>as is insinuated in that</HI> Prolegomena <HI>is fond to imagine</HI>; To which I say, Why so? <HI>Elias</HI> thou Confessest to Assert what he did in such honestly, as not in way of sleighting the Points, nor the Scripture, any more then if they had been the Work of <HI>Ezra,</HI> from whose dayes, and no higher, thou derivest their Pedigree (but sith thou canst not do it from <HI>Moses,</HI> thy <HI>Antiquity</HI> is but <HI>Novelty</HI> with us) So, why may not the Testimony of one learned and honest <HI>Elias</HI> now out-weigh the Te|stimony of many <HI>Iewes,</HI> now (whose general Testimony thou sleightest, and them too, as wicked, when they speak against thee) as well as the Testimony of one <HI>Elias</HI> of old out-weighed that of 950 of the <HI>Prophets of Boal,</HI> and the <HI>Groves,</HI> 1 King, 18?</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="169">Thirdly, And as to the Argument from the <HI>Iewes keeping a Copy without</HI> Points, <HI>which they adore in their Synagogues, thereby little lesse then implying the</HI> Points <HI>to be of man, and not of Divine Original</HI>; Which Argument is of weight, for, if the Letters were the <HI>Word,</HI> and the Points with them a part, of as <HI>Divine Original</HI> as the rest, they durst not diminish ought, much lesse so great a part as the Points, knowing the Curse denounced in it against all detracters from it, <HI>Deut.</HI> 4.2.

<P N="1">1. Its <HI>the constant Opinion and perswasion of them all</HI> (Elias <HI>only excepted) that they are of divine Extract.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> Which if it were as certain to thee, as it but seems so, on the Conjectures of such, as thou sidest and consultest with; yet <HI>Elias (ur prius</HI>) might be <HI>right,</HI> and they all <HI>wrong,</HI> being all under the Curse, as well as some, so that their Testimony about Scripture, though they have it a|mong them, is no more to be heeded with thee, where it makes against thee (and why it should be more when it makes for thee, a reasonable man can't see) then <HI>Aesops Fables,</HI> as to the use of the whole <HI>Talmud</HI> of the <HI>Robbins</HI> in <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> Pag. 236. 240.</P>
<P N="2">2. To let passe the rest as pedling, thou tellest that and the Reason <HI>why the</HI> Jewes (who have, for ought I find, more Books without then with Points) have their <HI>Canon</HI> and <HI>Standard</HI> without them, is (as they alledge) the <HI>difficulty of Transcribing Copies without any failing, the least ren|dring the whole Book, as to its use, in their Synagogues, prophane.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> To which say I, If it be so difficult, then how darest thou date so deeply as thou dost on the unquestionablenesse of the <HI>Transcripts of the Bible with</HI> Points <HI>being as entire to a</HI> Tittle <HI>as the first</HI>? This is (<HI>ad ho|minem</HI>) enough to confute thy own vain Confidences about the <HI>non-cor|ruption</HI> of the <HI>Text</HI> throw all Ages to this day.</P>
<P>And again, Because the least failing renders their <HI>Standard</HI> prophane, therefore they'l make their <HI>Standard</HI> of such a Copie, as shall fail altoge|ther, as to the <HI>Points,</HI> as <HI>divinely Essential</HI> a part with them (<HI>secundum te</HI>) as the very <HI>Consonants</HI> themselves: <HI>Credat Appella</HI>: he that believes not that Conjecture about the Scripture, shall never come into Condemnati|on (as <HI>I.O.</HI> talks some shall for not owning the whole <HI>Letter</HI> and its Tittles as the <HI>Word of God</HI>) for his damnable unbelief, I dare assure him.</P>
<P N="3">3. That <HI>the</HI> Jewes <HI>end seems to be this in not</HI> Pointing <HI>their standing Copies,</HI> viz. <HI>That none be admitted to read or sing the Law in their Synagogues until he be so perfect in it, as to be able to observe all</HI> Points and Accents <HI>in a Book where there are none of them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> Which is another Whimzy of thy own brain, for I have often seen and heard their Service Read and Sung in their <HI>Synagogues</HI> by <HI>young Boyes,</HI> as the mouth of the whole body of 7 or 8 years of Age or little more, however at utter incapacity to observe all Points so exactly as thou speakst of, where there are none.</P>
<P>And to the rest of thy Answers throw that whole Chapter to the other Arguments against the <HI>Coavousnesse</HI> or <HI>Connaturalnesse</HI> of the <HI>Points,</HI> from <HI>E|lias</HI> his <HI>Testimony,</HI> the <HI>Talmuds silence about the</HI> Points, the <HI>Keri and Ketib,</HI>

<P>Let's see then what force this consideration (viz.) the <HI>love, provi|dence, care, and promise of God,</HI> to <HI>his Church and Word, Engaging for the preservation, and continuance of it to a Tittle, without losse, hath in it</HI> to evince the <HI>entirenesse</HI> of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Greek Text</HI> to a <HI>Tittle.</HI></P>

<P>Thus much to the first of those Scriptures urged by thee <HI>I. O.</HI> to prove the <HI>promise of God to preserve the Scripture,</HI> even! <HI>every Tittle of the external Texts in Transcripts, (</HI>not <HI>Translations), for Ever,</HI> and the second is like unto it, (viz) Math. 5.18. where though Christ talks of not one <GAP DESC="foreign"> or Tittle failing, he that shall understand him speaking there, of the out|ward writing, and outward Tittles of the Law of it, many <HI>Tittles</HI> and <HI>Books,</HI> of which were lost before that, and not of the light it self, which is that Law, the Letter is but a Copy of, and of the <HI>word it self</HI> that Christ speaks, which is that that is heard by his <HI>sheep onely,</HI> in the heart, and that comes immediately from his own mouth, understands neither what he says, nor whereof he affirmes; yet in three places <HI>I. O.</HI>
<PB N="147" REF="188">
quotes it to evince the <HI>Integrity,</HI> and <HI>Identity</HI> of every Tittle of the Text, as 'twas at first, (viz.) p. 13.155.317.</P>
<P>The Third is as little, <HI>alias</HI> not one <HI>jot</HI> not <HI>Tittle</HI> to <HI>I. O</HI>'s purpose, (viz.)1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.25. where <HI>Peter</HI> speaks no more of any outward Texts or Transcripts, then if he had said nothing at all: nor of such a <HI>cor|rupting</HI> thing as <HI>Manuscripts, Texts,</HI> and <HI>Transcripts, Titles,</HI> and <HI>dead Letters</HI> are, but of the <HI>incorruptible seed,</HI> the <HI>Word of God,</HI> that <HI>liveth, and endureth for ever,</HI> ver. 23. Even the word of the Gospel, which was that word of faith <HI>Paul</HI> also writes of, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.8. which was preached by the Apo|stles, and Testified to by them, and <HI>their Scripture,</HI> and <HI>Moses Scripture, Deut.</HI> 30.14. and all <HI>outward Scripture,</HI> that its <HI>nigh within, in the heart and mouth.</HI></P>
<P>The Fourth, viz. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. no verse of which is quoted, is so far from adding a cubit to <HI>I.

conjectures, upon the signification of one or two words, and it shall be of weight with us, is it meet that a matter of so huge importance, called into Question by none but themselves, should be cast and determined by their conjectures? doth they think men will part with the possession of Truth upon so easie Terms, that they will be cast from their inheritance by divination?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bona verba quaeso, Possession of any thing</HI> that's counted an inheritance, I confesse is eleven points of twelve, and they that are in it commonly count that <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Right</HI> is on their side <HI>right</HI> or <HI>wrong,</HI> and the more ado and harder task they have, who have to do with them to storm them out, but as the case here stands, it's no great matter, sith <HI>I. O.</HI> the <HI>possessour fights for us against himself.</HI> Art thou <HI>an Author of credit</HI> thy self <HI>I. O.</HI> whose Testimony may be taken for Truth? wilt thou believe thy self if not others? I confesse as thou sayest p. 102. of the <HI>Romane Har|lot, the common fate of lyars hath so befallen her, for lying mostly in many things she professeth, that she deserves not to be believed when she talks the Truth,</HI> p. 225. So I may say of thee, though I believe thee when thou speakest truth, yet thou utterest so many <HI>untruths,</HI> that thou scarcely deservest to be believed when thou tellest the Truth: but yet if thou be of any credit with thy self, and thou wilt but take thy own word, then we are well enough, and have wherewith to answer thy challenge, having thy self in the self same Book we have here to do with, speaking more then one word at least, and that's enough (<HI>ad bominem</HI>) to this purpose, <HI>viz.</HI> that there was in the world a Copy of the Bible different from what we now enjoy in one word at least (and that's in more then Tittles, which thou, who art <HI>Callidus,</HI> more then <HI>Callidus</HI> in thy <HI>Re frigida</HI> contendest for) sith the <HI>Keri</HI> and <HI>Ketib,</HI> those 840. words which are confest by thee to vary in their Consonants, from what they should be written with, if what is in the margin were in the line, are confest by thee not to have been so from the beginning, which if not, then, there was once a Copy different from what we now enjoy, but of this thou wilt hear more from us by and by.</P>
<P>Secondly, p. 300. thou sayest, the <HI>difference in the sense taken in the whole context, is upon the matter very little, or none at all; at least each word both that in the margin, &amp; that in the line yield a sense agreeable to the Analogy of faith.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rep.</HI> Here thou mendest thy bad cause as well as one can well do, that makes it <HI>two-fold</HI> worse then 'twas before; for if there be welnigh a thousand words, not onely <HI>different in Consonants</HI> (which is greater then that of <HI>Tittles</HI>) but also such as makes the <HI>least difference</HI> in the <HI>sense of the Spirit,</HI> which (how many so e're the <HI>Text</HI> may bear) is ac|knowledged by all (but your selves that make many) to be but <HI>one alone</HI> ever to <HI>one word or place,</HI> then thou thy self overturnest that <HI>certainty</HI> and <HI>Identity</HI> of not onely the <HI>Text</HI> it self thou so loudly contendest for, but also, in <HI>some measure, of the Truth it self contained therein,</HI> which we say is <HI>eternally entire,</HI> let the <HI>Text</HI> run which way it will; but thou here art forced to confesse, that in the <HI>Keri</HI> and <HI>Ketib,</HI> there's not onely a <HI>varia|tion in words,</HI> but also thereby in the <HI>very sense it self.</HI></P>
<P>And though thou wouldst fain mend it when thou hast done, by <HI>min|cing the matter,</HI> making as if the <HI>Context considered,</HI> the difference in the
<PB N="162" REF="199">
sense is upon the matter <HI>very little,</HI> and <HI>agreeable,</HI> either way to the <HI>Analogy of faith</HI> (as ye often speak, whereby if not blinded ye might see, how, for all ye call the <HI>Scripture</HI> your <HI>Rule of Faith,</HI> yet ye more serne the <HI>Scripture</HI> into the sense of a suitablenesse to your <HI>modern devised model</HI> of faith still, then suit and <HI>model</HI> your faith according to the <HI>true sense of the Spirit and mind of Christ in the Scripture</HI>) yet that's a meer <HI>false seeth</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gment</HI> of thy own, for in some places there arises from the <HI>Keri</HI> and <HI>Ketib</HI> a very vast variety, not to say <HI>clear contrariety in the sense</HI>; such as, if the <HI>Context be consulted</HI> with, is <HI>consistent with the faith but one way onely, and not the other</HI>; and sith thou puttest it to the tryall, by the variety of those two words <GAP DESC="foreign"> and <GAP DESC="foreign"> which are the same in sound, yet most distinct in their <HI>significations,</HI> and so, of all the <HI>varieties</HI> that are of this kind, seeming to thee of the <HI>greatest importance</HI>; of which it is observable that <GAP DESC="foreign"> whose <HI>signification is [not]</HI> is fourteen or fifteen times put in the Text or line instead of <GAP DESC="foreign"> whose signification is [<HI>to him or it</HI>] which is set in the margin: I am <HI>willing</HI> to be tryed by that <HI>very variety</HI> that is of thy <HI>own naming</HI> the better to satisfie thee.</P>
<P>And whereas thou sayest, that though these seem contrary one to the other, yet wherever this falls out, a <HI>sense agreeable to the Analogy of faith</HI> ariseth <HI>fairly</HI> from <HI>either word,</HI> instancing in some places picke out by thee for thy <HI>own purpose</HI>: I say if it do hold, its not worth a pin, or point, to the proof of what thou sayest, if in any one of those four|teen or fifteen places it appear to the <HI>contrary</HI>; and that it does, let me be so bold (fith thou instancest in two that are <HI>fittest for thee</HI>) to in|stance but one that, <HI>makes against thee,</HI> and then, I shall trouble my self no more with thy <HI>Keri</HI> and <HI>Ketib,</HI> which would make one, if not <HI>sick,</HI> yet at least <HI>sorry,</HI> for thee to see how <HI>sorrily thou shifts</HI> by it: <HI>Isa.</HI> 9.3. thou <HI>hast multiplyed the Nation, not encreased the joy,</HI> say the <HI>Ketib,</HI> or <HI>word in the Text,</HI> but the <HI>Keri</HI> or word in the <HI>Margin</HI> is <GAP DESC="foreign"> [to it] which <HI>marginal Reading</HI> (though <HI>Translators</HI> following the mistake of the <HI>mis-transcribers</HI> keep to the <HI>Ketib</HI>) is undoubtedly the <HI>true and onely sense of the</HI> Spirit, for the reading in the line, as it is in both <HI>Transcripts</HI> and <HI>Translation,</HI> is (considered with the Context) a piece of meer <HI>non-sensicall contradicti|on</HI>; thou <HI>hast encreased the Nation, not encreased the Ioy, they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, as men rejoyce when they divide the spoil</HI>; what a jarre does the word [<HI>not encreased the Ioy</HI>] make in the sense of that verse; yea it makes it meet <HI>confusion</HI> and <HI>contradiction,</HI> to say the <HI>joy is not enlarged,</HI> and yet it is enlarged like to that of men that <HI>rejoyce in har|vest,</HI> and at the <HI>dividing of the spoil</HI>; but read it by the <HI>Keri</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign"> [to it] thus, <HI>(viz) thou hast multiplyed the Nation, thou hast encreased joy to it, or its joy, they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, as men rejoyce when they di|vide the spoil</HI>; and then there's no <HI>discord</HI> in the sound, but its all <HI>sweetly sutable</HI> and <HI>harmonious,</HI> and agreeable to the <HI>Analogy of the true faith</HI> also.</P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> thy Eleventh is, <HI>The security we have that no mistakes were volunta|rily or negligently brought into the Text, before the coming of our Saviour, who was to declare all things, in that he not once reproves the Iewes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n that Account, when yet for their false glosses on the word be spares them not.</HI> And
<PB N="163" REF="199">
this Argument is urged o're again p. 316 interrogatively thus, (viz.) <HI>can it be once imagined, that there should be at that time such notorious va|rieties in the Copies of the Scripture through the negligence of that Church, and yet afterword neither our Saviour nor his Apostles take the least notice of it,</HI> yea <HI>doth not our Saviour himself affirm of the word that was then among them (Scripture with thee) that not <GAP DESC="foreign">, should passe away or perish?</HI></P>
<P N="1"><HI>Rep.</HI> 1.

<P N="2">2. <HI>Varieties</HI> and <HI>mistakes</HI> might <HI>befall the Scriptures,</HI> thy self elsewhere confessest, p. 167, 168, 169. through the <HI>invincible infirmity of mens failings and fallibility</HI> in such a work as <HI>transcribing</HI> the best things, and through <HI>meer weaknesse,</HI> when through neither <HI>wilfulnesse,</HI> nor <HI>negligence,</HI> nor <HI>un|faithfulnesse,</HI> and so passe as <HI>unreproved,</HI> as they are in that case <HI>unrepro|vable.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. There might be <HI>mistakes</HI> of that nature through the <HI>Scribes wilfulness and negligence, perverting Scripture,</HI> and those reproved by <HI>Christ</HI> too, and his <HI>Apostles</HI> also, and thou ne'r the wiser, there being <HI>many things truely, that Iesus did and spake, that were never written in those Histories of him ye have,</HI> and that his <HI>Apostles did, and spake, that are not written by Luke in the Acts, nor in their Epistles,</HI> the <HI>which if they should be written every one, the world it self would not be able to contain them,</HI> among which, that <HI>such a re|proof</HI> was not one, is more then thou knowest; though thou wilt <HI>vent thy verdict</HI> very vainly ond positively still at a venture.</P>
<P N="4">4.

<P N="5">5. <HI>Christ and his Apostles,</HI> in their often quoting Scripture out of the <HI>Old Testament,</HI> kept to the <HI>substance and sense of the words, not alwayes</HI> to the <HI>Text,</HI> in <HI>totidem verbis, verbatim,</HI> or to a <HI>Tittle,</HI> Isa. 42.1, 18, 19, 20, 21.

<P>Neverthelesse thou wilt by no means allow that the Translators lay un|der the same <HI>loving Aspect,</HI> who had as much to do with God, and as <HI>reli|gious a care and diligence</HI> in their work, as <HI>Transcribers</HI> had in theirs, with a <HI>due Reverence</HI> of him with whom they had to do; yea not to <HI>acknowledge these freely in them</HI> (which is the utmost thou darest ascribe to the others) without clear and unquestionable <HI>Evidence to the contrary,</HI> is as high <HI>un|charitablenesse</HI> and <HI>ingratitude</HI> (by how much their pains was the greater of the two) as not to acknowledge the same in the <HI>Transcribers</HI>: the <HI>care and diligence</HI> of which said <HI>Translators</HI> yet, who must be <HI>supposed</HI> to be as much in a <HI>subserviency</HI> to that thy <HI>supposed promise</HI> and <HI>providence of God</HI> (I say) hath no more produced the <HI>effect thou contendest for,</HI> (i.e) the entire agreement of their Copies to a Tittle with the first <HI>Originals,</HI> thou that of the <HI>Transcribers</HI> hath done, which hath not produced the said effect so ex|actly as thou dreamest.</P>

<P N="5">5.

what they do, &amp;c.</HI> that <HI>I can give very little credit to what I have nothing but the Authority, Ability, Integrity, Wisdom, Knowledge, Truth, Memory, Care and Diligence of such to rely upon for, without evidence of their being divinely and infallibly guided, which guidance</HI> thou denyest to thy Scribes; nor can any wise man groundedly believe any other, but that the Books of Scripture passing through the hands of many such <HI>Transcribers,</HI> have upon them the <HI>marks</HI> of their <HI>neglects, ignorance,</HI> and <HI>sloth,</HI> and have had (as hard of belief as thou seemest to be of this; p. 206.) the fate of other books.</P>
<P>Yea <HI>I.

<P>Not the first, for thou utterly disclaimest that, as no ground of <HI>divine faith</HI> about the Scriptures, by saying thus, p. 105. <HI>if numbers of men may be allowed to speak, we may have a Traditional Testimony given to the blasphemous figments of the Alcoran. But the constant Tradition of more then a thousand years, carried on by innumerable multitudes of men, great, wise, and sober, from one generation to another, doth but set open the gates of hell for the Mahometans,</HI> and thus, p. 114.115. <HI>though I should grant, that the Apostles and penmen of the Scripture, were persons of the greatest industry, honesty, integrity, faithfulnesse, holinesse, that ever lived in the world</HI> (as they were) <HI>and that they wrote no|thing but what themselves had assurance of, as what men by their senses of seeing and hearing, are able to attain; yet such a knowledge and assurance is not a suffi|cient foundation for the faith of the Church of God, if they received not every word by inspiration, and that evidencing it self unto us otherwise then by the Au|thority of their integrity, it can be no foundation for us to build our faith upon.</HI></P>
<P>Not the latter, for thou disclaimest that, and darest not ascribe any such thing as <HI>infallible guidance,</HI> or <HI>divine inspiration</HI> to thy <HI>Trustee Transcri|bers:</HI> so where the <HI>divine faith</HI> about the <HI>firmnesse of thy foundation</HI> it self stands founded, and bottom'd unlesse it be in the <HI>bottomlesse pit</HI> it self of thy <HI>own fancy,</HI> he must have more <HI>Rope to fathom with</HI> then I have, that will ever find.</P>
<P>Wilt thou not then <HI>I.

us that they were <HI>fallible,</HI> and that 'twas not impossible for them to mistake? This grant of thine, we are as free to accept of as thou art to give it, and make good use of it too, not so much against as for thy self (<HI>viz.</HI>) to shew and instruct thee from thence, that there's <HI>rottennesse</HI> at the very root of all your <HI>Religion,</HI> and a <HI>fearful flaw</HI> of fallibility that is in the very <HI>foundation</HI> of your <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>believing,</HI> in which thou sayest ye are built on the <HI>writings of the Prophets</HI> and <HI>Apostles,</HI> T. 1. c. 2 S. 4, that so ye may (which is the worst that we wish you) come to be better built on a <HI>firmer foundation,</HI> and both you and your <HI>foundation</HI> and <HI>faith</HI> and all may stand fast, and never (as now ye must do) fall any more from thenceforth for ever; even the <HI>foundation of the Apostles</HI> and <HI>Pro|phets</HI> it self, which was not their <HI>writings,</HI> for these were not their foun|dation, nor were given to be ours; for if they were, then they had been built upon themselves, and we are to be upon them, which is absurd to say, for neither their own preachings nor writings were their <HI>own founda|tion</HI> which they were built on, nor are we to build onely upon them, but both they and we upon that which all holy men, were built on from the beginning, before any writing was at all, (viz.) <HI>Christ Iesus the light, the corner stone</HI> which the <HI>blind builders</HI> refuse, on whom whoever <HI>builds and be|lieves,</HI> if he never come to read one Tittle of any outward writing, shall assuredly <HI>never be ashamed.</HI></P>

<P>There is no Reason that men should surprize us with the sense of so many varieties of Readings as they do, through the <HI>evident mistakes of the</HI> Scribes, for though I confesse there are many, yet what should they be counted on, as <HI>considerable, as Corruptions,</HI> or <HI>mistakes of the Scribes</HI>? be|ing they are no more then <HI>evident mistakes of the Scribes,</HI> and so of <HI>no im|portance at all</HI>; whereas the very Question it self that is pleaded by us a|gainst <HI>I.

<P>But 2 ly. as to the <HI>diminutives,</HI> upon which <HI>I.O.</HI> perhaps will plead he puts the prime stresse in the case in hand, somewhat must be said, lest <HI>I.O.</HI> judge himself sleighted, if they be answered with, nothing but silence (for as <HI>little importance</HI> as they are of to his cause, and as <HI>little importance</HI> as he would by them make our <HI>Assaults</HI> to be of against his <HI>Arch Assertion,</HI> yet 'tis like he sets so much store by them, as to suppose them to be <HI>strong supporters</HI> for his <HI>small matters,</HI> and <HI>pidling propositions,</HI> which to him (as he sayes p 153.) are <HI>important Truths,</HI> to stand stedfast upon) away with all those different

<P>So sayest <HI>I.O.</HI> contrary to <HI>Buxtorf</HI> whom he quotes, The amendment of the 18. places was but of <HI>Apiculi,</HI> and yet confessing 'tis uncertain whether there were <HI>any amendment of</HI> 18. places at all, yea or no: if he knowes <HI>what was corrected,</HI> then the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> is certain that there was <HI>a correction</HI>; but if he know not whether there were any <HI>such correction</HI> made or no, then <HI>'ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> not certain</HI> to him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat 'twas but of such <HI>diminutive Tittles,</HI> as he would make it.</P>

<P>J.

<P><HI>Rep.</HI> Many things in this Parcel are utterly false, being uttered [as they are] of the whole Scripture, and all its first Pen-men [for what is said of the Old, as to the immediate manner of its giving forth, is said also [saist thou, <HI>pag.</HI> 9.27.] of the New] insomuch that its not onely very fond, but savour|ing also of no small ignorance, both of, and in the <HI>Scripture,</HI> for any such <HI>Minister</HI> of no more then the meer <HI>Letter</HI> of it, as our <HI>Divine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> are, much more below the <HI>Ministers</HI> of the <HI>Spirit</HI> to hold out for truth, or so much as to imagine within themselves; and as they are utter untruths, so much lesse are they of force to evince that false <HI>Assertion</HI> to be <HI>Truth,</HI> which thou J.O. wouldst conclude from thence, <HI>viz</HI> That their Writings are <HI>uncontroulably known to be the Word of God.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. What a crude conception of thy vain mind is this, that the Laws, Do|ctrines, Instructions, Stories, Promises, Prophesies written (which I confess were not their own formed, as many, if not most of thy false Doctrines and strange stories about the Scriptures are thine own, formed by [unreasonable] Reasonings) were not so much as conceived in the minds of the Pen-men? Were they not conceived in them by the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI>? And <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly.</HI> by them, so as that (for the most part at least) they understood, knew, and believed them as <HI>Truths,</HI> before <HI>they</HI> committed them to Writing, as they were moved by the Spirit of God to do, for the use of others? And though they wrote not but at the Will of God, and his spirit pressing them thereunto; and under the burthen of the Word of the Lord that lay upon them, till they had dischar|ged themselves of it; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Whereupon some Prophesies were stil'd, The Burden of the</HI> Word <HI>of the</HI> Lord.</NOTE> yet art thou so silly as to conceive they delivered things before they were conceived in them? So far at least they were con|ceived in and by them too, as to prove thy saying little less then senselesse and absurd.</P>
<P N="2">2. VVhereas thou sayest, they were not <HI>retained in their memories</HI> from what they had heard, nor by any means before-hand comprehended by them: Is not that as absolutely absurd and false as the rest? Did they in writing de|clare things for truth, and teach Doctrines, and give out Instructions, and
<PB N="17" REF="226">
tel stories, &amp; relate passages, before they had so much as heard of, or seen, or be|lieved, or embraced what things they wrote &amp; rehearsed, or entertained them as such, or by any means beforehand comprehended them? Is not this directly contrary to what the Apostles say, who had, and wrote from the same spirit of Faith with them of old, who write thus, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.13. <HI>As it is written Psal.</HI> 16. 10. <HI>I believed, and therefore have I spoken; so we also believe, and therefore speak, &amp;c.</HI> 1 Joh. 1.1.3. <HI>That which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, look's on, and handled, declare we to you.</HI> And when <HI>Isaiah</HI> wrote things of Christ, did he not see his glory? <HI>Isa.</HI> 6.1. <HI>Iob.</HI> 12.40, 41. &amp; <HI>Lev.</HI> 1.2.11.19. Is <HI>Iohn</HI> commanded to write anything in his Booke but what he had seen? And did he write or bear record of the <HI>Word of God,</HI> or the Testimony of <HI>Iesus,</HI> that he did by no means before-hand comprehend, or of any things but those he saw? And is not seeing one means of comprehending?</P>
<P N="3">3. Sith thou saist, The things they wrote were not retained in their memo|ries from what they had heard; Did they first heare, and see, and be|lieve, and comprehend, and entertain them into their memories, and then not retain, but let them slip, and quite forget them before they wrote, and then began to write when they had, and not before they had remembred to forget them? <HI>For of the things thou writest, this is the sum</HI>; the whole sum of which, though 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.10, 11. is cited to add weight to it, which gives not the least dram of evidence to the truth of one tittle of it, is found by such as weigh it in the Ballance of right Reason, to be a lye, and lighter then va|nity it self.</P>
<P>Belike then according to thy fancy, <HI>Paul</HI> when he wrote to <HI>Timothy</HI> to bring his <HI>Books,</HI> and <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rchments, &amp; Cloak</HI> left at <HI>Troas</HI> with <HI>Carpus,</HI> wrote that, not as a matter conceived in his mind, or retain'd in his memory, but as a thing for|gotten, that he had no comprehension of afore-hand? Did he not write that and a hundred more matters, as retain'd in his memory: And though he wrote them as mov'd by the spirit, in the wisdom of which he liv'd &amp; walk't, and did all he did, as he saw service in it; yet did he not write of his <HI>Revela|tions</HI> and <HI>Temptations</HI> after them, by the thorn in the flesh? 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.1. &amp;c. and of his many perils and hazards he had gone through, and his <HI>whippings,</HI> and <HI>stonings,</HI> and <HI>shipwracks,</HI> and other <HI>sufferings</HI> and <HI>services,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. as things <HI>retained in his memory,</HI> though some of them fourteen years behinde? And when he wrote of the <HI>Fornication,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. and the <HI>Divisions</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. that were among the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> did he not write of them as things he had by <HI>hear-say,</HI> and <HI>common Report</HI>? And did he not retain in his memory what was told him by them of the House of <HI>Cloe,</HI> and thereupon wrote to them thereof, as of a matter heard, remembred, and afore-hand believed, (<HI>For L partly believe it,</HI> quoth he) and comprehended aforehand? VVhat innume|rable instances of the like fort of <HI>stories</HI> written, as <HI>retained in the memories</HI> of holy VVriters, might be given out of both the <HI>Old Testament</HI> and the <HI>New</HI>! But this little is enough, if thou be not wilfully blind, to bring thee into a <HI>remembrance</HI> of thy <HI>babling</HI> about the <HI>Bible,</HI> of the writings whereof thou writest, as if thou hadst never read it all, but in a dream.</P>
<P>And when <HI>Matthew</HI> the <HI>Publican</HI> wrote of his own being called from the Receit of Custom, and of his entertaining <HI>Christ</HI> in his house, <HI>Matth.</HI> 9.9. Did he it not on the account of his retaining that passage in his memory?</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="227" MS="y">And whereas thou saist they wrote all <HI>immediately from God,</HI> so as that there was onely a <HI>passive</HI> concurrence of their <HI>rational faculties</HI> in their reception, without any such <HI>active</HI> obedience as by any Law they might be obliged to.

May it not very well be supposed that some of these things were written at first (if by such holy men, as all the <HI>Iews</HI> were not, that were very zealous of the Letter of the Law, and in writing the deeds done in their Nation) yet at least in such wise onely, as holy men may, without imme|diate reception of every Tittle [as thou twatlest they did] from God, and by the <HI>active</HI> concurrence of their rational faculties, write a story of what is done in their sight, or of what they have by hear-say, or find in the Books of the Chronicles of things done in such or such Nations?

the spirit moving the holy men to it that liv'd in the spirit, yet) so as not without a retaining them in their memories, and an <HI>active</HI> concurrence of their rational faculties, and such an active obedience, as by some Law they might be obliged to? Yea, how frivolously foolish art thou in the uttering of thy self? Is not the very moving of the spirit it self, in which thou own|est they wrote, and the Law of the spirit obliging thereto?</P>
<P N="2">2. And what thinkest thou of the History of <HI>Iohn, Mark,</HI> which some have in that respect stiled <HI>Sacrum furt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m,</HI> a kind of holy Theft; is it not possible but that it might be some <HI>Abbreviation</HI> of <HI>Matthew</HI>'s story concer|ning Christ, there being little in it but what is well-nigh word for word in the other? Though some Ancients have related it to be given forth by <HI>Peter,</HI> and by <HI>Mark</HI> onely written from his mouth, either of which if it was, then was it not so <HI>immediately</HI> from God, as thou <HI>I.O.</HI> guessest, as to the Writing of it, the Pen-man taking it either out of anothers Writing, or else from the mouth of another man, that had it more immediately then he, and yet neither of them so immediately from God, as that there was onely a <HI>passive</HI> concurrence of their <HI>Rational</HI> faculties in the reception of it; for whether it were <HI>Mark</HI> writing out of <HI>Matthew,</HI> or from <HI>Peter's</HI> mouth, or of him|self, as it seemed good to him to set down, 'twas but a History of such things, as he was well acquainted with, either as an <HI>eye</HI> or <HI>ear</HI>-witness thereof, or as one that had it sufficiently <HI>attested</HI> to, for him to undertake to write it out as <HI>truth</HI>; and so not without an <HI>active</HI> concurrence of his rational faculties in the reception of what he wrote, as well as not without a moving thereto by the holy spirit, in which he lived, and in the light of which he saw it might be serviceable.</P>
<P>And on such an account as this, rationally reckoning within himself, it might be useful so to do, <HI>Luke</HI> the Physician wrote his two <HI>Histories</HI> of the <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> and of his <HI>Apostles</HI>; in which Book called the <HI>Acts,</HI> ma|ny, if not most of the matters mentioned by him, were about <HI>Paul,</HI> whose Companion he was in several of his <HI>Travels,</HI> excepting some passages a|bout the beginning of it, concerning all the <HI>Apostles</HI>; and some touches concerning <HI>Barnabas</HI> and <HI>Silas,</HI> and some others, upon occasion of their being here and there with <HI>Paul</HI> in some services; but as for the Apostles af|ter whom his Book is called the <HI>Acts of the Apostles,</HI> there's scarce the one hundredth part of what they all did, nor of those <HI>travels</HI> and <HI>sufferings</HI> that they sustained, medled with at all by <HI>Luke,</HI> who took notice of little more then what he knew, as he was a fellow-<HI>traveller</HI> with <HI>Paul.</HI></P>
<P>And that his Writings were of no other nature then thus, appears plain|ly by his Preface to the first of them, which ye call, <HI>The Gospel of St. Luke,</HI> where <HI>Luke</HI> 1.1, 2, 3, 4. he writes on this wife: <HI>Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a Declaration of those things, which are most surely be|lieved among us, even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eye-witnesses and Ministers of the Word, it seemed good to me also, having had a perfect understanding of things from the beginning, to write unto thee in or|der<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> most excellent</HI> Theophilus, <HI>that thou mightest know the certainty of those things wherein thou hast been instructed.</HI> Which words, [<HI>many have taken in hand to de|clare what was delivered to them by the eye-witnesses, and it seemed good to me also to write to thee, &amp;c.</HI>] sound forth, That howbeit the spirit of God might

<P>But the reason why so few Priests are ever made true Prophets, is because for the most part they are more prophane then other people, from of old, and much more now; insomuch that, as heretofore, I mind at present, but two of all that numerous Tribe, Race, and Party of Priests, that the Jewish Church was fill'd with, that became Prophets, <HI>viz.

<P>They hearken not with <HI>Habbakkuk</HI> to what God saith in them. <HI>Hab.</HI> 2.1. They <HI>stand not in the Lords counsel,</HI> nor <HI>receive the word from his own mouth,</HI> but as the false Prophets of old, <HI>Ier.</HI> 23. (in which respect they were false Pro|phets, that profited not at all, and such as God was against, though speaking true words) they steal the word they speak out of the true Prophets Wri|tings, whom God sent, and spake to, when he neither sent, nor ever said the same unto them, and so run crying, <HI>Thus saith the Lord,</HI> as ours do, <HI>hear the Word of the Lord,</HI> as you shall find it in such a <HI>Text,</HI> such a <HI>Chapter,</HI> such a <HI>Verse</HI>; when they <HI>never heard God's voice at any time</HI> themselves, nor <HI>saw his shape.</HI></P>
<P>They hate and fight against Gods own counsel, the Light in the Consci|ence, which would lead them to purity in their own persons; and so never come to see, much less to <HI>shew</HI> his <HI>Secret,</HI> which is onely with them that fear him <HI>Psal.</HI> 25. whose sear, which is the beginning of Wisdom, is to depart from the evil, which the light discovers; and so as none can bring a clean thing out of an <HI>unclean,</HI> so none can receive much of a clean thing into an unclean.</P>
<P>But as <HI>Isaiah</HI> who was of unclean lips, had his lips first toucht, and his

<P>That the <HI>Scripture</HI> is none of all that which thou testifiest above that it is, and which no <HI>Qua.</HI> do deny the <HI>Word of God</HI> to be, is the business which now lyes before me to make good, in order whereunto I shall take the se|veral particulars into examination, and make some Animadversion of what thou sayest in proof of those particulars in the <HI>Affirmative,</HI> affirming, I that not the Scripture, but the light the letter came from is the only most sted|fast relief against contentious, confusions, darkness and uncertainties.</P>

<P>But I say (not blaming the Scripture as the cause of it, which is holy, just, and good, when <HI>wise men</HI> have the handling of it) that throw the <HI>doting disputers of this world</HI> about it, who in their <HI>wrangling mindes</HI> and <HI>restless pens</HI> wrest the <HI>Writings</HI> of it to their own and the worlds ruine, the Scripture, <HI>canoniz'd</HI> by men as their rule of faith, is become (as the Gospel of peace is of war to the lewd mindes) the <HI>occasion,</HI> or <HI>causa sine qua non</HI> of all the <HI>con|fusion, darkness, uncertainty,</HI> which by the <HI>vanity, folly,</HI> and <HI>loosness of mens mindes, drawn out a whoring</HI> after the <HI>letttr</HI> without, from the <HI>light</HI> and <HI>spirit</HI> within, by <HI>divine dotages</HI> on it, and <HI>dim divinations</HI> out of it for means, and the <HI>unspeakable alterations</HI> of it, and endless <HI>enmities</HI> and <HI>hatreds,</HI> and <HI>envyings</HI> one of another about their own <HI>sottish senses,</HI> and mishapen meanings on it, hath too certainly been heightened, and <HI>is already long since run out into.</HI> So that as <HI>Aristotle</HI> and <HI>Ramus</HI> the two received and respective <HI>Standards</HI> for the <HI>junior Sophisters</HI> of our two <HI>Nurseries, Oxford,</HI> and <HI>Cambridge,</HI> to fight under in their <HI>Logical scoldings</HI>; So the <HI>Scripture</HI> is made by our <HI>senior School-men</HI> in their <HI>Scholastical Theological S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nffles,</HI> a <HI>Standard</HI> more to <HI>squabble</HI> about, and fight under, than a <HI>Standard</HI> to try and determine <HI>Truth</HI> by (as they call it) and is nothing but an <HI>ample Armory</HI> from which they fetcht most of their furniture where with all in their mad malicious mindes to <HI>fence</HI> against each other concerning the <HI>Scriptures</HI> it self, and such <HI>plain truths</HI> as lye open to all honest capacities therein, and lye hid from none more than these <HI>wise</HI> and <HI>prudent Praters</HI> of it, who like the <HI>Horses and Riders,</HI> Zach. 12.4. being of the Lord smitten with <HI>madness, blindness,</HI> and <HI>astonishment,</HI> run on to battel as <HI>Warriours,</HI> Isa. 9. with <HI>confused noise,</HI> till the Nations where they live lye languishing for their wicked wills sakes, <HI>with their Garments rolled in blood.</HI></P>

<P>And page 316. <HI>The great and blessed Foundation of Truth.</HI></P>
<P>All this I own to be very true of the <HI>Word of God</HI> of which the <HI>Scripture</HI> speaks, but it is utterly false as uttered by thee of the <HI>Scriptures.</HI> The false|hood of which appears plainly by this Argument.</P>
<P N="1">1. Argument, That <HI>which is the great and blessed Foundation of all that truth, faith, hope and obedience that God requires at mens hands, and of the Church and of the Apostles and Prophets must be something,</HI> which was in being before any of these things were, for the <HI>Foundation</HI> on which these are built must have a being before they can be built thereupon, every <HI>Foundation</HI> being be|fore the <HI>building</HI> can stand upon it.</P>
<P>But (though the <HI>Word of God</HI> be so, yet) the <HI>Scripture</HI> is not before, but long after that <HI>truth, faith, hope</HI> and <HI>obedience,</HI> which God requires at mens hands, and long after the <HI>Church,</HI> and long after the <HI>Apostles</HI> and <HI>Prophets</HI> were, yea after those <HI>Apostles</HI> and <HI>Prophets</HI> were <HI>Respectively,</HI> who were the <HI>Respective pen-men</HI> thereof.</P>
<P>Therefore the <HI>Scripture,</HI> the <HI>Writing,</HI> the <HI>Letter,</HI> the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Hebrew Text</HI> is not the <HI>Foundation</HI> of any of these things.</P>
<P>The first Proposition is so true that it were no less then disparagement to <HI>I.O's</HI> wisdom, &amp; to suppose him to be <HI>mentis inops</HI> to go about to prove it to

<P>The first and <HI>affirmative</HI> part of the <HI>minor</HI> is not denied by thee [as the <HI>major</HI> cannot be] and if thou deny the second part of the <HI>minor</HI> which is <HI>ne|gative,</HI> and denies the <HI>Scripture</HI> to testifie of it self in any place that its the <HI>Foundation,</HI> then assign where the <HI>Scripture</HI> calls it self the <HI>Foundation,</HI> or else own that it doth not, and so that it is not the <HI>Foundation</HI> at all, much less the truest, or the <HI>only one,</HI> as thou often intimatest, either <HI>expresly,</HI> or in terms equivalent, it is [<HI>Ep.</HI> p. 25 <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>not any means of standing out of utter uncertainty about all sacred truth if the</HI> Heb <HI>punctation be invention</HI>; also, p. 64, 65. not a <HI>truer</HI> Foundation for <HI>for faith to repose it self upon.</HI>]</P>

<P>But the <HI>Scripture, letter, Hebrew,</HI> and <HI>Greek Texts</HI> (how ever <HI>I.O.</HI> pleads their <HI>integrity</HI> in every <HI>Apex, point, tittle</HI> and <HI>iota</HI>) yet are [as I have shewed above more at large in answer to his long <HI>Tattle</HI> about the <HI>Tittles</HI> and <HI>points</HI> and <HI>indentity</HI> of <HI>Lections</HI> of the letter] by his own confession <HI>mistaken</HI> and <HI>mistranscribed</HI> in small things, yea and in some matters of more <HI>moment</HI> and <HI>importance</HI> in the best transcribed Copies of the <HI>Original Text,</HI> therefore the <HI>Text</HI> or <HI>letter</HI> of the <HI>Scripture</HI> cannot be a fit <HI>Foundation</HI> for the Churches faith, but the <HI>spirit</HI> and <HI>Word</HI> within is onely so. <HI>Psal. 75.3.

<P>Beginning first with <HI>T.D</HI>'s <HI>Jejune Replies</HI> to what <HI>Reasons</HI> were rendred by us to him against his <HI>Dream,</HI> that there is no other standing Rule of faith and life but the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> and so proceeding to an <HI>Examination</HI> of his, and <HI>I. O</HI>'s. <HI>excentrick exhibitions</HI> of the <HI>Scriptures</HI> being the <HI>only Rule</HI> thereof interchangeably as I see occasion.</P>
<P>The first Argument urged against thee <HI>T.D.</HI> at the third <HI>Publick Dispute</HI> (as thy self relatest it in p. 28, 29. of thy first Pamphlet) to prove the <HI>Scrip|ture</HI> not the <HI>only Rule</HI> of <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>life</HI> was this.</P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> 1. If there be another standing <HI>Rule</HI> then the <HI>Scripture</HI> is not it. But there is another standing <HI>Rule,</HI> therefore the <HI>Scripture</HI> is not it.</P>
<P>The <HI>minor</HI> thou deniest, and sayest expresly that there is no other <HI>standing Rule,</HI> but the <HI>Scripture,</HI> which <HI>minor</HI> my proof of which thou rendrest as weakly as well as thou canst, I proved in these very <HI>terms, viz.</HI></P>
<P>If the <HI>Scripture</HI> it <HI>self</HI> sends us to another, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>spirit</HI> as our <HI>Rule,</HI> then it <HI>self</HI> is not the <HI>onely Rule</HI>: But it <HI>self</HI> doth so; therefore it <HI>self</HI> is not it.</P>
<P>The <HI>minor</HI> of this being denied by thee was proved thus,</P>
<P>That which the <HI>Scripture</HI> bids us <HI>walk in, by, after,</HI> or <HI>according</HI> to, that it sends to, but the <HI>Scripture it self</HI> bids us <HI>walk in, by, a fur,</HI> or <HI>according</HI> to the <HI>spirit,</HI> therefore the <HI>Scripture</HI> sends us to another besides it <HI>self</HI> as our <HI>Rule,</HI> and consequently is not (it <HI>self,</HI> the <HI>only standing Rule</HI> of <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>life</HI>; in proof of this <HI>minor,</HI> Gal. 5.16. was cited, and some other Scriptures which thou leavest out (whether as one loath to tell too much of that truth that makes against thee or no, I will leave to thy conscience, and not say, but some may likely think so for all that (as namely <HI>Gal.</HI> 6.16. besides I know not whether I instanced in any other, which I shall here take that leave which in that <HI>confused crowd</HI> of <HI>conference</HI> thou strovest (as thou sayest thy self) to <HI>out-word</HI> us by, for fear of being confuted, thou wouldest not then grant me, to urge by way of addition at this present, <HI>viz.</HI> Rom. 8.1, 4, 5, 13.

<P>Nevertheless it were not for the <HI>Truths</HI> sake that it may more fully appear, there is little need to say any thing more to thee than thou thy self hast set down, in thy <HI>Reply</HI> to that Text, <HI>viz.</HI> This I say, <HI>walk in,</HI> or rather <HI>to,</HI> or <HI>ac|cording to the Spirit,</HI> and <HI>ye shall not fulfil the lusts of the flesh</HI> (for it is <GAP DESC="foreign">|<GAP DESC="foreign">, the dative case, which without the preposition's is else|where Engli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ht <HI>by,</HI> or <HI>according</HI> to <HI>viz.</HI> Gal. 6.16.

<P>And no less do all those phrases however denote, <HI>viz Rom.</HI> 8. 1.4.5.13. <HI>Who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit;,</HI> then a being taught, led, gui|ded, ruled, directed by, as well as moved, acted, and enabled from the Spi|rit so or so to believe or do; for it is <GAP DESC="foreign"> which Praeposition though join'd with the <HI>Genitive,</HI> signifies <HI>contra,</HI> against, as <HI>Gal.</HI> 5.

<P>And no less then so, doth <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.16. import, where <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>the Saints at Philippi, with the Bishop</HI> and <HI>Deacons,</HI> according to their several statures and degrees of growth in the <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> wishes all that were per|fect (as every one is that is faithful to his own measure) to be so minded as himself; yet leaving every one to <HI>believe,</HI> and <HI>judge</HI> by his own measure of <HI>Light,</HI> not binding any one to his, till God himself should <HI>reveal</HI> things as he knew them, to those that were yet <HI>otherwise</HI> minded: <HI>Neverthelesse</HI> (quoth he) <HI>whereunto we have already attained, let us walk, or steere our course by the same Rule,</HI> let <HI>us mind the same thing</HI>: Which same Rule, or same thing that he wills all, though their measures of <HI>Light</HI> may be different, to mind and walk by, He that shall dream it to be the <HI>Letter</HI> of the <HI>Scripture without,</HI> and not the <HI>inward Light, Grace,</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Christ, a measure</HI> and <HI>manifesta|tion</HI> of which is according to the measure of the gift of Christ <HI>distributing</HI> to <HI>every one severally, as he will,</HI> (to some more, some less, some one, some two, yet to every one, one talent, at least) <HI>given to every man to profit withall,</HI> to improve, trade with, and thrive by: <HI>Matth.</HI> 25.15. <HI>Rom.</HI> 12.3.6. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12. 7.11. <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.7, 8. compared with <HI>Psal.</HI> 68.18.

<P>So that we deny not the Scriptures <HI>ad extra</HI> to be many wayes <HI>useful, pro|fitable</HI> in their <HI>place</HI> and <HI>time,</HI> where they are to be read, as they are not, in so much as the tenth part of the world, and where they are read in the <HI>light,</HI> &amp; by them, who live in that <HI>Light,</HI> that gave them forth, which are not the hun|dreth part of those, that usually read and search them; but will all this prove them to be what <HI>I.O.</HI> and <HI>T.D.</HI> contend so stiffly to have them be. <HI>viz.</HI> in that high Authority of the <HI>Rule,</HI> nay the <HI>only most perfect standing Rule of all true belief and holy life, before the very light and spirit of God they had their very original supreme being from, thorow the hands of holy men, as but subordi|nate instruments in their first purity as writings, except that little that was pend by God himself, which we now have not?</HI> which Scriptures yet as to the being they now have, are handed to us from no higher principle then the <HI>transcription</HI> of <HI>meer fallible,</HI> and as <HI>I.O.</HI> sayes, <HI>un-inspired men</HI>?</P>

<P>Yet the <HI>Canon</HI> or most <HI>perfect</HI> and only <HI>standing Rule</HI> it is not because God did never <HI>Authorize</HI> or <HI>appoint it so to be,</HI> but [to retort back to <HI>T.D.</HI> in his own vain phrase] <HI>thought the measure of his light and spirit every one hath from himself sufficient to make a standard of,</HI> besides whose <HI>inspiration</HI> of the said <HI>Scripture</HI> to make a Rule is necessary <HI>Gods appointment</HI> of a <HI>Writing</HI> to such an end, the <HI>difference lyes in God arbitrary dispensation,</HI> as well as in the <HI>ex|cellent preheminence</HI> of the <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>Light</HI> above the <HI>Letter,</HI> who would have that to be the <HI>Rule, Canon, Standard, Touchstone,</HI> which was so from the be|ginning of the world, two thousand years afore the letter was, even to this day, even the <HI>Spirit,</HI> then which there can be no other designed by him to, that end, if <HI>I.O</HI>'s words be true, <HI>Ex.</HI> 4. s. 22. who saith <HI>Vnicus est</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>divinus,</HI> the Divine Canon or Rule, is but one, not more, then which also there is no other mentioned in the <HI>Scripture</HI> by that name of the <HI>Rule,</HI> but <HI>the Light and Spirit</HI> (as I have shewed above) out of those places where the

<HI>Rule</HI> is spoken of, and if there be, let <HI>I.O.</HI> or <HI>T.D.</HI> assign where, and here|upon, as he saith in the other case, so conclude I here in this, we can look upon none but the <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Spirit,</HI> upon no <HI>letter with such regard as the only Rule, as we do upon that.</HI></P>
<P>So then notwithstanding <HI>T.D's impertinent, unimportant,</HI> utterly untrue <HI>Reply</HI> to this <HI>Argument,</HI> That we are to <HI>walk by is our Rule,</HI> but the <HI>Spirit is that the Scripture sayes we are to walk by,</HI> Gal. 5.16. therefore the <HI>Spirit</HI> is the Rule, which Reply runs, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>phrase denotes the principle not the Rule of our obedience in that place,</HI> the Argument stands firm over the head of it; for though it betoken the <HI>principle</HI> also, yet not only, nor <HI>exclusively</HI> of the <HI>Rule,</HI> but rather the <HI>Rule</HI> more <HI>evidently,</HI> and much more <HI>eminently</HI> than the o|ther, yea that the <HI>Spirit</HI> is the <HI>principle</HI> of all true <HI>obedience</HI> is professed <HI>po|sitively</HI> by us, who own nothing to be truly done in way of true obedience unto God, nor the <HI>letter,</HI> but what is done from the <HI>principle, power, motion, assistance,</HI> and <HI>ability</HI> of the Spirit of God, or that is done without the Spi|rits in-dwelling; yet in that place considered together with the rest above cited, it is most clear that the Apostle speaks of the <HI>Spirit</HI> principally as of the <HI>Rule</HI> by which we are to walk [and the word <HI>walk</HI> imports no less than the act of proceeding or going on] and not the <HI>principle, original,</HI> or <HI>primum mobile,</HI> as I may say, from which we are to begin to act and move in way of obedience unto God.</P>
<P>But as <HI>unanswerable</HI> as <HI>T.D</HI>'s. answer is to our Argument, yet it serves us very well to prove him a self-contradicter, as he and <HI>I.O.</HI> also are in mul|titudes of more matters besides, and in that it is as answerable as may to his wonted self; for let but any reasonable Reader observe, as it follows p. 29. of his first Pamphlet what <HI>T.D.</HI> sayes next of all to this passage of the Spirits being the <HI>principle,</HI> that is, the <HI>original</HI> or <HI>beginning</HI> of our obedience from which as being the <HI>primum movens</HI> and <HI>Auxilians,</HI> beforehand <HI>moving</HI> and <HI>assisting,</HI> we are after to obey, and he shall see how he overthrows it himself in his own most <HI>immediately</HI> ensuing speech; for howbeit he sayes the Spirit is the <HI>principle of our obedience,</HI> which is as much as to say, that in which we first walk whose assistance must be antecedent to our true walking accord|ing to the <HI>letter,</HI> which is not denied by us, yet when we say the same with him he unsayes his own saying again, rather then he will side with us, for whereas I said, as his own self there relates, that the <HI>Spirit is antecedent to the letter, so that none tan walk in the letter, till they walk in the spirit</HI>: he replies thus, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>spirit is subsequent</HI> to the <HI>letter, in respect of the assistance and ability which he gives to obedience</HI>; and whereas you affirm, quoth he, That <HI>none can walk in the letter till they walk in the spirit, if walking in the spirit be meant of special assistance,</HI> which is as much as to say, if by that phrase of walking in the Spirit, you mean the Spirits being the <HI>prinriple</HI> of our obedi|ence, tis false, <HI>for many walk in many things according to the letter without the spirits in dwelling&punc; as</HI> Paul <HI>while a Pharisee, was touching the righteousness of the Law blameless,</HI> Psa. 3.6. in which, beside the rounds he runs in, and the contra|diction to himself above, <HI>T.D.</HI> sayes false, for though none walk accord|ing to the <HI>letter</HI> in <HI>truth,</HI> and as to the <HI>spiritual</HI> obedience it calls for, without the Spirits in-being and assistance, and power; as the Principle from which they must so walk, for howbeit <HI>Paul</HI> walked according to the <HI>righteousness of
<PB N="68" REF="252">
the Law,</HI> interpreted in <HI>sensu Pharisaico,</HI> according to the Pharisees outside glosses on it, who saw not into the <HI>marrow, mystery</HI> and <HI>spirituality</HI> of it, and was zealous of God, as to the <HI>literal observation</HI> of many things, yet till the Law which is the light, and spiritual came to him who was in his carnal condition, and shewed him sin in the <HI>lust,</HI> of which Christ expounds the Law, <HI>Matth.</HI> 5, he kept not the Tetter as to the spiritual import and true intent and utmost meaning of the spirit and minde Christ exprest therein to the spiritual understanding, though not to the natural, but abstained only from outward grosse acts of sin, and in his blind zeal persecuted the Church, as ye in your wild-braind zial do at this day.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spirit</HI> is the <HI>principle</HI> from which <HI>we are to walke, and with ut which we cannot walke according to the letter, yet,</HI> to go round again, <HI>many walk accord|ing to the letter without the Spirits in-dwelling</HI>&punc; So <HI>pervenire ad summum nisi ex principiis nemo potest; Pervenire ad summm sine principiis aliquis potest.</HI> This is the summe of <HI>T.Ds.</HI> Doctrine.</P>
<P>Besides if the Spirit be the <HI>principle</HI> only that men begin to beleeve and obey from, and not the Rule according to which they go on in <HI>beleeving</HI> and <HI>obeying,</HI> then it seems with thee faith is to be <HI>begun</HI> and <HI>begotten,</HI> and <HI>born</HI> by the Spirit, but <HI>kept, preserved,</HI> and <HI>nourished</HI> up to <HI>perfection</HI> by the <HI>letter,</HI> which is a Doctrine of deep <HI>dotage</HI> and <HI>deceit,</HI> for it is the <HI>Spirit</HI> of Christ, and the <HI>light</HI> that is both the <HI>Creator</HI> and <HI>Preserver,</HI> the <HI>Author and finisher of the faith,</HI> insomuch that I may truly, and do here justly cry out against you blind, <HI>bewitching broachers,</HI> and your <HI>blind bewitched beleevers</HI> of it, as <HI>Paul</HI> on the <HI>Galatians, I marvel that ye should be so sottishly departed and degenerated from the simplicity of the primitive Gospel</HI> so plainly declared in the very <HI>letter</HI> it self, which asserts the <HI>Light, Spirit</HI> and <HI>Word</HI> within to be both the <HI>principle</HI> and the <HI>Rule. O ye foolish Prophets and foolish People who hath bewitched you that ye should be so reprobate as to the knowledge of the truth?</HI> Are ye so foolish as to fancy that when men have once begun in the <HI>Spirit,</HI> they must be <HI>preserved</HI> in their faith, and regulated and made perfect by their fleshly attendences to the <HI>Letter</HI>? that the <HI>Vniversi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ies</HI> and <HI>Ministers</HI> meerly of it, and not of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> are so lost about, and wrangling about, that to this day they are not agreed about the <HI>integrity</HI> of its Text?

<P>One ignorant untrue Assertion more of <HI>T.D.</HI> while my eye is on it I may not here let pass without notifying it to the Reader, and then for ought I see, I may leave <HI>T.D.</HI> as to his talk of the Scriptures being in the <HI>nature,</HI> or <HI>office,</HI> or <HI>authority</HI> of a <HI>Rule,</HI> and see what <HI>I.O.</HI> sayes as to this.</P>
<P><HI>T.D.</HI> sayes p. 17. of his 2. Pamph. <HI>Suppose we had the signs recorded that are not written, yet were they not our Rule,</HI> yet confesses <HI>that were they written they might be useful being done for the very same end with those lest us.</HI> G.

<P><HI>Rep.</HI> To which say I <HI>T.D.</HI> is not so little sensible of the contradiction <HI>G.W.</HI> charges him with, as every understanding Reader may be greatly sensible of the flat falshood, that is told for truth in this latter clause, wherein he asserts the first creation did <HI>exclude second causes</HI> or <HI>instruments,</HI> though the <HI>second doth not,</HI> whereas if <HI>T.D.</HI> had not been in a Dream, he would have seen that the first Creation is so far from excluding <HI>instruments</HI> or second <HI>causes,</HI> if that be an <HI>instrument</HI> or <HI>second cause,</HI> which himself instances to be one in the second Creation, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Word of God</HI>; for as the Scripture sayes that the <HI>Saints</HI> are begotten to God and faith by the <HI>Word of God,</HI> so it sayes but that our <HI>Scriblers</HI> for the <HI>Scriptures</HI> are little skill'd in it, and so study it in their dark minds till they cannot see what, who is not blinde cannot ea|sily over-look) <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.3. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.5.7. <HI>By faith we understand,</HI> in plurali, <HI>the worlds were framed by the</HI> Word of God, and <HI>that by the</HI> Word of God, <HI>the heavens and earth were of old, and the heavens and earth that now are by the</HI> same Word <HI>are kept in store and reserved to fire against the day of Judgement and perdition of ungodly men.</HI></P>
<P>You had need be ashamed to pretend to be such appearers in publick <HI>pro Scripturis</HI> that appear so much in your testimony so flatly against them as <HI>ye</HI> do.</P>
<P>Now as to J.<HI>Os.</HI> prosecution of the proof of this matter, which he so often over and over again avouches as a truth with <HI>divine faith</HI> to be imbraced on <HI>pain and peril of eternal ruine and damnation, viz</HI> That the Scriptures are in the <HI>Authority</HI> of, the <HI>only</HI> and <HI>perfect Rule</HI> and <HI>Canon</HI> since the compleating of which no <HI>inward Light</HI> or <HI>Spirit,</HI> or <HI>new Revelations</HI> about the faith and <HI>Divine worship</HI> of the <HI>Saints</HI> are either to be expected or admitted, it lyes more in the negative, then the positive, or affirmative, consisting for more large|ly of disproofs (such as they are) of any inward Light, Spirit, or <HI>spiritual Reve|lation</HI> to be at all, then of proofs of the Letter or Scripture (yet some pedling ones are puzled out to such a purpose) to be altogether and <HI>alone</HI> the Rule of faith, holy life, and divine worship.</P>
<P>He professes to prove the inward Spirit or Light, the <HI>Qua.</HI> plead for <HI>not to be the Rule,</HI> and that the Scripture or Letter is so, two wayes, first, <HI>Au|thoritative,</HI> or by the Scripture it self. 2. <HI>Rationative,</HI> or by a <HI>Rational</HI> way of <HI>Argumentation</HI>: But though I own the <HI>Authority</HI> and <HI>veracity</HI> of the Scrip|ture, so far that if <HI>I.O.</HI> could produce any place of the Bible, as he pretends
<PB N="76" REF="256">
to do many, wherein the Scriptures do ascribe to themselves the <HI>Honor, Au|thority</HI> and <HI>Title</HI> of the onely <HI>perfect Rule</HI> either <HI>in terminis,</HI> or by any such due deduction, as is not more duely deniable, then so much as <HI>probale</HI> to a prudent man indeed, I should truly submit to one such testimony, being perswaded that the Scriptures are <HI>writings of truth,</HI> where not <HI>altered,</HI> and not <HI>adulterated</HI> by mens <HI>mistakings,</HI> and <HI>mistranscribings,</HI> yet the Scriptures being wrested besides all <HI>sense</HI> and <HI>reason</HI> by J.O. and the <HI>Theologians</HI> he ad|hears to, to that end, I deny his proofs to be either <HI>Athoratative</HI> or <HI>Ratio|nal.</HI></P>
<P>The testimonies he urges the <HI>Authority</HI> of, to prove the Text to be in the <HI>Authority</HI> of the <HI>only Rule</HI> he casts into four <HI>Classes</HI>; the first sort of which consist of such places as <HI>expresse</HI> (as he sayes) and <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>vel per immedia|tam cousequentiam perfectionem hanc Scripturis ascribunt,</HI> do expresly &amp; <HI>verbatim,</HI> or else by immediate consequence ascribe such a perfection as of the only <HI>Rule</HI> to the Scriptures.

<P>Of the first sort he impannels eleven in all&punc; not being able it seems to pick out a whole <HI>Jury</HI> to serve his turn, howbeit I acknowledge these, if they would as <HI>freely,</HI> as he <HI>forcibly</HI> would have them, pass their <HI>verdict</HI> for him, to be enough, being all of them good and true <HI>witnesses</HI> in another case then he calls them for, they stand all together in <HI>Ex.</HI> 3. s. 26. <HI>viz.

<P>I shall draw them up into the form of an Argument, and then we shall see what expressnes in them, or <HI>immediate consequence</HI> there is from them to the Scriptures being the <HI>only Rule.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Arg. John</HI> sayes Jesus <HI>did more signs then are written in</HI> his Book <HI>or</HI> History of him, but what he wrote was <HI>that men might beleeve that Jesus is the Son of God, and beleeving might have life through his Name. David,</HI> that the <HI>Law of God is perfect, converting the soul, the Testimony of the Lord is sure making wise the simple, the Statutes of the Lord pure, enlightning the eyes. Luke,</HI> that it <HI>seemed good to him also, seeing some others had taken in hand such a worke, having had perfect understanding from the first of the things Iesus did and taught, to write an orderly Declaration thereof to</HI> Theopilus (whether a particular person so called, or any lover of God who can tell? for so is the name by interpretation) <HI>that he might know the certainty of the things wherein he</HI> [by which it seems ra|ther to have been some eminent man] <HI>had been before in part informed</HI>; and Christ said, Men must <HI>hear</HI> Moses <HI>and the</HI> Prophets, <HI>or else will not be perswa|ded to repent, if one rise to them from the dead. Peter,</HI> that <HI>the Saints have a
<PB N="77" REF="256">
more sure word of Prophesie to which they do well that they take heed, as to a light that shineth in a dark place till the day dawn, and the day star arise in their hearts. Paul</HI> to the Romans, <HI>That faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God</HI> To the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> that the <HI>minds of the</HI> Jews <HI>were blinded, for until this day the vail remaineth on their hearts untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament, which vail is taken away in Christ.</HI> To the <HI>Galathians,</HI> that as <HI>many as walk according to this Rule,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Christ, the Light, and his Spirit.</NOTE> <HI>peace shall be on them, and Gods</HI> Israel. To <HI>Timothy,</HI> that <HI>evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived,</HI> willing him to <HI>continue in the things he had learned and been assured of knowing of whom he had learnt them, and that from a childe he had known the holy</HI> Scriptures, <HI>which were able to make him wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Iesut,</HI> that <HI>all</HI> Scripture <HI>is given by inspiration of God, and is profi|table for Doctrine, Reproof, Correction, Iastruction in Righteousness, that the man of God might be perfect throughly furnished to all good works.</HI> To the <HI>Ephe|sians,</HI> that <HI>they were no more strangers and forrainer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, but fellow-citizens with the Saints, and of the houshold of God, and built upon the foundation of the</HI> Prophets <HI>and</HI> Apostles, Jesus Christ <HI>being the chief corner stone.</HI></P>
<P>God <HI>forbids</HI> to adde to his <HI>Word,</HI> he <HI>commandeth</HI> and <HI>threatens</HI> to adde <HI>Plagues</HI> to them that so do. <HI>Paul</HI> sayes, <HI>Let him be accu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sed who ever brings another Gospel then that he had preached to the</HI> Galathians, <HI>though the</HI> Apostles themselves, <HI>or an</HI> Angel <HI>from heaven.</HI> Christ asked the Pharisees, <HI>Why they made Gods Commands void by their Traditions.</HI> Paul sayes, <HI>He in a figure transferred to himself, and to</HI> Apollo <HI>the things that he had wrote to</HI> Corinth, <HI>that none of them might think of either of them above that which he wrote of them</HI> as meerly Ministers, <HI>by whom they beleeved,</HI> and not be as they were very apt to be pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t <HI>up for one of them against the other, and glorying in man.</HI> God bids seek not to <HI>Wizzards that peep and mutier but to himself, his Law and Testimony. The</HI> Berean <HI>searched the</HI> Scriptures <HI>daily whether the things were so or no the</HI> Apostles <HI>preached.</HI> Apollos <HI>was mighty in the</HI> Scriptures, <HI>and as mightily con|founded the</HI> Jews, <HI>proving thereby that</HI> Jesus <HI>was</HI> Christ. <HI>Paul</HI> said <HI>no other things then what</HI> Moses <HI>and the</HI> Prophets <HI>said should come.</HI> John Baptist <HI>came for a witness to bear witness of the light, that all through him might beleeve.</HI> God sayes, <HI>If the</HI> Israelites <HI>observe not all the words of the Law written in that Book of</HI> Deuteronomy, <HI>he would make their Plagues wonderful.</HI> Christ ex|pounds to his <HI>Disciples</HI> all the Scriptures in <HI>Moses</HI> and the <HI>Prophets</HI> con|cerning himself, bids, <HI>Search the Scriptures as testifying of him. Paul</HI> sayes, <HI>Whatsoever was written afore time was for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the</HI> Scriptures <HI>might have hope.</HI> He says, <HI>To write the same things to the Church is safe. John</HI> sayes he writes his <HI>Epistles</HI> to the <HI>Saints</HI> that their <HI>joy might be full.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore the outward Letter of the Scripture is the onely Rule of all faith, and Divine worship, and not the Light and Spirit of Christ ye only call to, nor any internal <HI>Revelation</HI> whatsoever, <HI>ficta vel facta.</HI></P>
<P>In which of all these Scriptures the Title and Authority of the only most <HI>perfect standing Rule</HI> of Faith, Life, and Worship, is either expresly, or by any true, mediate, much more any <HI>immediate consequence</HI> ascribed to the Scriptures who can finde but he's that not blinde?</P>

<P>And as for those <HI>Texts</HI> that do make express mention of the <HI>Scriptures</HI> and outward <HI>Writings</HI> of the <HI>Apostles,</HI> and of <HI>Moses</HI> and the <HI>Prophets,</HI> and the <HI>Old Testament,</HI> as <HI>Iohn</HI> 20. <HI>ult.

<HI>vail's being over the Iews hearts in the reading of the Old Testament,</HI> which <HI>Vail is done away in turning to Christ the Light,</HI> to evince any such matter? Doth it not rather evidence the very contrary? For if the Old Testament, which is <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>the Letter written with Ink or Pen, or engraven on stones,</HI> is as a <HI>Vail</HI> over the hearts of such as read it as the <HI>Iews</HI> do, of whom <HI>I.O.</HI> sayes, pag. 236. <HI>They read it without the administration of the Spirit, so that its a dead Letter, of no efficacy for the good of souls.</HI> Which&punc; Vail is to be, and is done away no otherwise then in <HI>Christ the Light,</HI> and by turning to the Lord that Spirit, (as <HI>Paul</HI> sayes it is) then doth it not rather appear that the <GAP DESC="foreign"> the <HI>Letter written</HI> and <HI>engraven outwardly</HI> is not the onely most <HI>proper stand|ing Rule</HI>; but Christ's Light, the <HI>Spirit,</HI> and the measure, and manifestation thereof within, given to every man to profit withal? And what though <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Timothy</HI> doth commend the <HI>inspired Scripture,</HI> (if yet we shall take that for the outward Writing) as <HI>profitable to make the man of God,</HI> who onely knows how to use it wisely, more and more <HI>wise, and to furnish him perfectly to exhort, &amp;c. and every good work,</HI> against the <HI>gainsayers</HI>? as I have shewed a|bove that I deny not the outward Scripture so to be to such a one: And what though Christ saies in order to escaping the place of <HI>torment,</HI> Let <HI>men hear Mo|ses and the Prophets,</HI> if <HI>yet we shall take Moses and the Prophets for their outward Writings</HI>? And what though <HI>John</HI> sayes <HI>Christ did more then he wrote of him,</HI> (as well he might; For <HI>Matthew, Mark, and Luke</HI> wrote many things that he did not, and others wrote other matters, that were written by none of these) What though he doth write that his writings were that the <HI>Saints might believe</HI> that <HI>Christ was the Son of God,</HI> and <HI>believing might live through his Name,</HI> and <HI>that their joy might be full; i.e.</HI> That encrease might be to them of Faith and Joy: see 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.13. does their being useful and profitable, and penn'd for the same common end, as the Light is given for in the con|science, conclude them by such an immediate consequence as J.O. con|ceives, to be design'd and appointed by God to be <HI>canoniz'd</HI> and established into the onely <HI>Canon,</HI> into the sole <HI>standing Rule</HI> and <HI>Standard</HI> for all things of <HI>Faith, Manners</HI> and <HI>Worship</HI> to be tryed by: so that nothing can or may safely be believed, done or practised in obedience to God, or acceptable to him, without particular and expresse recourse first had unto the Scrip|tures?</P>
<P>If this be good and immediate consequence of J.O. <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Scriptures</HI> and <HI>Letter</HI> hath the same common end with the <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>Light</HI>; and is <HI>useful</HI> and <HI>profitable, comfortable</HI> and <HI>serviceable,</HI> as the other is, though not so much.</P>
<P>Therefore the <HI>Scripture</HI> or <HI>Letter,</HI> is the onely most <HI>perfect, standing-Rule</HI> universally for all truth to be tryed by, the onely <HI>Canon</HI> for men to come to, whereby to be rectified in <HI>Faith, Life, Worship,</HI> and all <HI>Obedience.</HI></P>

more necessary consequence, then J. O's. <HI>crooked Conclusion</HI> comes in by) to the defect of <HI>Scripture-Canon,</HI> as they call it, in <HI>its integrals,</HI> on this wise:</P>
<P>If there were other <HI>inspired Scriptures that are not bound up in your Bibles, as useful and profitable, and written to the same end with those you have, then they were as much a Rule as those ye have.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>there were, &amp;c.</HI> in proof of which <HI>minor</HI> instance was given in the first Epistle to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> mentioned in the first we have, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.9.11.

<P><HI>T.D.</HI> Replyes to this effect, see p. 26, 27. of his first <HI>Pamph. I deny your Consequence.

Because God intended these that are bound up in our Bibles, but not the rest, neither such as are lost; for had he intended those so lost, Poovidence would have watcht over them as o|ver the rest; nor such as are by his providence preserved neither, if not in our Bi|bles.</HI></P>

<P>Now if <HI>T.D.</HI> deny the <HI>consequence</HI> of the <HI>Qua.</HI> which is two fold clear|er, and more <HI>cogent</HI> then <HI>I.O</HI>'s. when they say all <HI>Scriptures written by inspira|tion, and preserved for our use to this day, are a Rule to us as much as any of them are, whether bound up, or not bound up by Stationers in our Bibles.</HI> Then how much more must he side with me in denying J.O's far fetch't consequence, though J.O. calls it immediate, [unlesse he will be denied justly for a daub|ing deceiver) when J.O. argues thus, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Scriptures are useful, profita|ble, and written to the same good ends and purposes, as the</HI> Light, Spirit, <HI>and</HI> Word of God; <HI>Therefore the</HI> Scriptures, <HI>the</HI> Letter, <HI>and not the</HI> inward Light, Spirit, Word, <HI>or any internal</HI> Revelation <HI>at all, are the only most</HI> perfect, standing Rule <HI>of all things, in matter of</HI> Faith, Life, Doctrine, Worship, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But I have reason to suspect and fear, that <HI>Night-Birds of a Feather,</HI> how|ever they clash and thwart one another, and fall out among themselves in the <HI>dark,</HI> yet will <HI>fall</HI> in, <HI>flock,</HI> and <HI>flye all together</HI> in the face of the <HI>Light,</HI> rather then seem to side therewith against each other, and that by some silly|come-senceless <HI>secundum quid</HI> or other, they'l <HI>seem</HI> to qualifie their more then <HI>seeming confusions</HI> if they can.</P>

<P>But alas <HI>hoc aliquid ver&egrave; nihil est,</HI> this <HI>something</HI> is plainly nothing at all to that purpose, for as it makes not a <HI>mice</HI> toward the proof thereof (as ap|pears above) because the Scriptures were written for <HI>good ends,</HI> and are <HI>pre|fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> to such and such <HI>good uses,</HI> unless God had Canonized them as a <HI>Rule,</HI> so neither doth it that <HI>Christ</HI> expounded the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> and that some did <HI>search them,</HI> and were mightily <HI>read</HI> in them (as some are at this day who are supposed to deny them) to the <HI>confounding</HI> the <HI>Scribes</HI> that searched them daily, and therein lookt for life as their only <HI>Rule,</HI> but never came to him that they might have life, who was the <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Light</HI> they came from but never

heard him whom they testified of, that his <HI>voice</HI> was now to be heard, in whom God who under the Law before his coming spake in his servants the Prophets, speaks under the Gospel, as by his only Son.</P>
<P>'Tis true, <HI>Abraham,</HI> who lived long after <HI>Moses,</HI> and those Prophets, whose <HI>Writings</HI> ye have, were born, in that Parable which illustrates a <HI>pre|cious truth,</HI> that as to the <HI>mystery</HI> of it lyes yet hid from thee, is brought in by Christ, as saying of the <HI>Rich mans brethren</HI> by way of prevention of their coming into <HI>torment, They have Moses and the Prophets let them hear them,</HI> if not they'l not be perswaded by a miraculous message of one to them from the dead: but what i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> this to prove what thou here alledgest it for, and more largely inferrest from it, p. 63, 64, 65, 66, 67. where <HI>thou preachest</HI> on that <HI>Text</HI> a Sermon as <HI>long as little</HI> to thy purpose, improving it and that of 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.19. to the utmost, to prove <HI>Moses</HI> and the <HI>Prophets</HI> Writings to be the <HI>best and most effectual means of bringing men to repentance,</HI> on which that, and all <HI>faith is immediately to be grounded,</HI> and to prove the Scriptures to be that <HI>alone, which we are sent to, to be more effectual and sure then either the greatest miracle that ever was, or immediate voice that ever God himself spake by from heaven,</HI> and to be the <HI>sole Rule</HI> and <HI>determiner</HI> of all Doctrines whether they be <HI>Truths,</HI> or but <HI>cunningly devised fables,</HI> which two Texts, together with <HI>Isa.</HI> 8.20. how little they evince any such matter, and what is meant in them by <HI>Moses</HI> and the Prophets, and by that <HI>sure World of Prophesie,</HI> which thou and thy fellows foolishly affirm to be the Scriptures I shall, God willing, take occasion to examine anon.

<P>Again it is true the <HI>Bereans</HI> did search the Scriptures whether the things were so as the Apostles spake, who spake nothing but <HI>summarily</HI> &amp; <HI>substantially</HI> the same which <HI>Moses</HI> and the Prophets did say should come; but what though they did so of their own accord, and their searching was <HI>succesful</HI> and <HI>useful</HI> also to the fortifying of the faith they had in the <HI>World of Truth,</HI> which they received readily not as the <HI>word</HI> of man, but of God, not as <HI>fables,</HI> but as <HI>truth,</HI> it coming to them as to the <HI>Thessalonians,</HI> not in <HI>word</HI> only, but in <HI>power,</HI> and the <HI>holy Spirit,</HI> and in much assurance, 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 1.5. must it needs follow therefore that the Scriptures were their only <HI>Rule</HI> of <HI>determining the Doctrines</HI> whether they were <HI>truths</HI> or <HI>fables,</HI> the <HI>Word of God,</HI> or the <HI>word of man,</HI> and that their faith and owning that truth was <HI>&agrave; priori,</HI> first, originally and immediately founded (as thou preachest all faith and repen|tance must be, page 58.64. on the Scriptures; so that if they had not first searched the Scriptures, and there found a congruity of the things with the old Writing, they neither <HI>would</HI> nor <HI>could</HI> have beleeved or received the truth? thus <HI>thou</HI> and most of thy <HI>faternity, foolishly fancy,</HI> but look again and ye will finde it far otherwise, for howbeit they searched the Scriptures, and did <HI>commendably</HI> and <HI>nobly</HI> therein, and were <HI>commended</HI> as more <HI>noble</HI> in that then they of <HI>Thessalonica</HI> (who yet are commended as <HI>noble, excellent,</HI> and <HI>exemplary</HI> as the other in receiving the <HI>Word</HI> in much affliction, with <HI>joy,</HI> as <HI>Gods,</HI> and not <HI>mans word,</HI> though, it seems, not so serious in searching the Scriptures as these, 1 <HI>Thess.</HI> 1.5, 6, 7, 8.) and were not a little confirmed in their faith begotten before, yet they <HI>first received the Word with all readiness of

minde</HI> as hundreds do at ths day, as preacht to them by <HI>word of mouth,</HI> from the Apostles, the <HI>witness of God</HI> being reached, and answering to the truth of it in their hearts, in which they were <HI>noble</HI> as <HI>Thessalonica</HI> was, yet more <HI>noble</HI> by how much they were unwearied and <HI>uncessans</HI> in seeking to be <HI>more and more gradually,</HI> and <HI>groundedly</HI> growing in fuller assurance of the truth, as many are at this day, who first <HI>beleeving</HI> and <HI>receiving</HI> the <HI>Word</HI> with joy and readiness, do not sleight (as ye suppose) but <HI>&agrave; posteriori</HI> being in the faith <HI>Timothy</HI> more seriously and singly then your selves see into the Scriptures, that being already brought into the things the Scriptures write of, <HI>through patience and comfort thereof have hope,</HI> according to that other Scripture of thy coating, <HI>Rom.</HI> 15.4. as yourselves cannot have any more then the Scribes, who stand studying and sraping with your own <HI>Animal under|standings</HI> before ye are ceme to walk in the <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> they <HI>witness too, and came from.</HI></P>
<P>But what's all this more then just nothing at all to prove the Scripture to be the only <HI>standing Rule</HI> of <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Life,</HI> which is asserted of it to the evincing it to be the <HI>Word</HI>? Nay if your eyes were in your head, ye might see of your selves [O ye <HI>Studentall,</HI> more than truly <HI>Prudential searchers of the Scriptures</HI>] that the <HI>Word</HI> the Apostles preached, and the <HI>Scripture,</HI> which we confess truly testifies thereof, are two distinct things, and in no wise <HI>one</HI> and <HI>same individual</HI> as ye would make them, if ye look no farther then the present Text in hand; for in that he sayes they <HI>received</HI> THE WORD <HI>with all readiness of minde,</HI> and <HI>searched the</HI> SCRIPTVRE <HI>whether the things were so</HI>; it imports to any but the blind <HI>searchers of the Scripture</HI> that the word they received was one <HI>thing</HI> and the <HI>Scripture</HI> they searched about the truth of it was another.</P>
<P>Again it is true, and not to be denied, but <HI>Apollo</HI> an <HI>eloquent Iew</HI> was from his being well versed therein before he came to own the <HI>Light,</HI> mighty in the <HI>Scripture,</HI> and learned in the Letter so as mightily to confound the <HI>Gospel gain saying Iews</HI> thereby, when once he came to obey it himself, though yet there was a tradesman and his wife further grounded in the Gospel, and learned in the light, than himself, who was beyond them in the Letter, of whom he was not ashamed [as our <HI>Vniversities</HI> Literatists are at this day, to learn of women, that know more of <HI>Gospel mysteries</HI> than they do] to stoop to be instructed in the way of God more perfectly, but how little this proves the Scripture to be the only <HI>standing Rule,</HI> for which end, <HI>I.O.</HI> cites it, he that is blinde cannot see, but others cannot chuse, when as he that was so well skilled in the <HI>Scripture</HI> [had that been the only Rule] that he could have in|structed <HI>Aquila</HI> and <HI>Priscilla</HI> about the <HI>Letter,</HI> with which <HI>suo sejugulaus gladio,</HI> he slew the <HI>Letter-learned Iews,</HI> as it were with their own sword, was not so clear in his understanding of the <HI>Truth, Way, Gospel, Spirit, Word,</HI> and <HI>Light</HI> of God [which is indeed the only <HI>standing inalterable Rule</HI> for ever as it ever was] but that he had need to be <HI>Regulated</HI> and <HI>Rectified</HI> there|in by such as in meer <HI>Scripture</HI> all knowledge were as inferiour, as they were superior to him in spiritual understanding.</P>
<P>Moreover what makes it to the proof of the Scripture to be the only <HI>standing Rule</HI> exclusively of the Light and Spirit, that <HI>Paul</HI> sayes to <HI>write the same things to the</HI> Philippians, by which its questionable whether he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> something to them before, which is lost, and not bound up in

As much as if he had said nothing at all; for nothing at all is that to <HI>I.O</HI>'s. purpose, nor yet that of <HI>Iohn</HI> saying, <HI>These things I write unto you, that your joy may be full,</HI> which J O. cites to the same end.</P>
<P>And true it is, Christ expounded the <HI>Scriptures</HI> to his Disciples, as he did also his own <HI>Parables</HI> that he uttered by word of mouth amongst them and the mixt multitude toge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her, and <HI>opened their understandings</HI> also (as he does theirs that walk in his light that they might understand them; but where is the <HI>immediate cogent</HI> consequence from hence, to the conscience of any, that the <HI>Letter</HI> or <HI>Scripture</HI> is the <HI>onely most perfect standing Rule</HI> of all <HI>Faith, Truth, holy life, Doctrine, Divine Worship, &amp;c.</HI> as <HI>I.O.</HI> states it to be, and <HI>T.D.</HI> al|so <HI>exclusively</HI> of the <HI>internal Light,</HI> Word, Spirit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And what though we should grant you, that <HI>Christ</HI> sayes to the <HI>Scribes, Search the Scriptures</HI>? Well, he might, for they testifie of him as the <HI>life,</HI> whom they never came to for it, who if they had known either the <HI>Scriptures</HI> a|right they so search't in, and scribled about, or the Power of God, they could not have erred from the knowledge of him in his <HI>Light,</HI> as they did, <HI>Matth.</HI> 22.29. We say the same to you <HI>Schollars,</HI> that think you <HI>study</HI> and <HI>know the Scriptures</HI> more then any men, as Christ to them, and as <HI>I.O.</HI> to all by way of <HI>command</HI> (whereas some can't read it) in his <HI>Title-page,</HI> to flourish his <HI>Frontispiece</HI> and vent his vindication, <HI>pro Scripturis,</HI> more then ought else, <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Search the Scriptures, for they testifie of</HI> Christ the <HI>Light,</HI> the <HI>Word,</HI> that <HI>Spirit, Way, Life, Truth</HI> we talk of, they send ye to the same <HI>Light,</HI> and <HI>inward Word</HI> in the heart, as the <HI>Rule</HI> to walk by, as the <HI>Qua.</HI> do, and as <HI>Christ</HI> said of them, <HI>Ioh.</HI> 5.46, 47. having told them they needed no other to accuse them, then <HI>Moses</HI> in whom they trusted; Had <HI>ye believed Moses,</HI> ye <HI>would have believed me, for he wrote of me; but if ye believe not his Writings, how should ye believe my word</HI>? So say I of you, Ye need no other <HI>witness</HI> against you, though <HI>ye</HI> have another (even the <HI>Light</HI> within, which ye despise) then the <HI>Letter</HI> in which ye trust; for did you <HI>believe the Letter,</HI> ye would <HI>believe in the Light,</HI> for it writes of the <HI>Light</HI> the <HI>Qua.</HI> call ye to, and write of; but if ye <HI>believe</HI> not the <HI>Writing</HI> ye so <HI>write for,</HI> how shall ye believe in the light?</P>
<P>Howbeit when all's done, as the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> being both the <HI>Indicative</HI> and <HI>Imperative Mood</HI> will as well bear it, so the Context doth much more clear it, that the <HI>Verb</HI> is rather <HI>indicative</HI> of their doting doings; then <HI>impe|rasive</HI> of their duty; and is rather to be rendred, <HI>ye search,</HI> then <HI>search ye</HI> the Scripture and contains rather matter of <HI>condemnation</HI> of them for that <HI>profitable deal of Do</HI> they made in their <HI>busie minds</HI> about the <HI>outward Scrip|tures,</HI> while in the mean time they heeded not <HI>Gods own voice,</HI> nor regarded the <HI>inward words</HI> abiding in them, then either <HI>commendation</HI> of their <HI>great, fruitless pains</HI> that way, or <HI>commendation</HI> of the <HI>Scripture</HI> to them to <HI>search,</HI> or <HI>commandment</HI> of them (who were too mad already for the <HI>Scripture,</HI> as their <HI>grand Idol,</HI> receiving it as thou faist, p. 236. with the <HI>honour and veneration due to God,</HI> and his <HI>living word</HI> alone) to search therein. Yea verily, both that verse and those about it, do all consist of matter of sad complaint against them for their <HI>ever-reverencing</HI> the Scripture, and <HI>negecting to receive,</HI> or rather <HI>refusing</HI> and <HI>rejecting</HI> the <HI>Word</HI> of <HI>Life</HI> it self to any single eye; ye

<P>J.O. This light in the Scripture, is <HI>nothing but the beaming of the Majesty, Truth, Holiness, and Authority of God,</HI> by this it <HI>dives, i.e.</HI> the <HI>Letter</HI> by the <HI>Light</HI> dives into the <HI>consciences of men into all the recesses of their hearts, guides, teaches, directs, determines in themin the Name, Majesty and Authority of God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rep.</HI> See how the <HI>Light</HI> is made the <HI>Letters Messenger</HI>; &amp; <HI>subordinate</HI> Agent; for <HI>By</HI> here is not such a <HI>By,</HI> as is used when the <HI>Inferior</HI> is said to act by the <HI>Authority</HI> of the <HI>Superior,</HI> but the <HI>Superior</HI> by the <HI>subse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">viency</HI> of the <HI>Inferior.</HI></P>

<P>Moreover the end of the Letter is but to turn men from the darkness and power of Satan, wherein they dwel, to the Light within them, that shines in the darknes that is also within them, which <HI>Light</HI> is the <HI>power of God,</HI> this <HI>Act.</HI> 26. is said to be the end of <HI>Pauls</HI> Ministration, which was performed <HI>partly</HI> by writing, and <HI>partly</HI> by word of mouth, that so by beleeving in the <HI>light and living</HI> in it they might not abide in the <HI>darkness</HI> but have the <HI>light of life</HI>; but the end of the <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> within is not to bring to the <HI>Letter,</HI> by the <HI>Letter</HI> we may have the life, for the searchers into the <HI>Letter</HI> and lookers thereinto for the eternal life, which is Christ, whom the Letter testifies of, never found the life they lookt for there, because they heard not Gods voice, nor cared for his word abiding in them, nor came to <HI>Christ</HI> the Light and Spirit, <HI>that they might have the life, for the letter killeth, but the</HI> Light <HI>and</HI> Spirit <HI>gives the life,</HI> 2 Cor. 3.</P>
<P>And howbeit I deny not the Scripture to be perfect <HI>praesertim respectu finis,</HI> especially in relation to that end, as J O. sayes, for which it was decreed of God, yet that that end was to be the only <HI>guide</HI> and <HI>rule</HI> of men in their way to life I deny, asserting the Light and Spirit still as that which is designed and ordered of God as to that end, and was so from the beginning before any Letter without was at all: And though I own the Scripture still as <HI>useful, profitable, effectual, sufficient,</HI> and <HI>perfectly successful,</HI> where used by the <HI>man of God</HI> in the <HI>wisdome of God</HI> for the many excellent <HI>ends</HI> and <HI>uses</HI> formerly spoken to from, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.15. as being written by in|spiration of God, yet I still deny that to be, thereupon, the <HI>standing Rule</HI> as the Light and Spirit is, because no where so denominated nor designed to be by God, in all the Scripture as I have shewed suffi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iently above in an|swer to all the Texts whence thou mistakest it so to be; and because <HI>Damnati lingua vocem habet, vim non habet,</HI> a <HI>Hereticks</HI> words are never heeded.

<P>And though with thee <HI>I.O.</HI> we assert and deny not, but that by the effi|cacy of the Light and Spirit the Letter is more savingly understood, for the Spirit well knows its own, yea by the Light and Spirit only is the Letter un|derstood and read to profit, and not by that <HI>twinckling twilight</HI> of thy <HI>fidling

<P>But the <HI>Qua.</HI> are not to be Ranked among such <HI>Ranke rejecters</HI> of it as the first.</P>
<P N="2">2. That such as spitefully reject the Scriptures are (though they are not so called in that of <HI>Iob</HI>) <HI>Rebellious</HI> against the Light also may well bee owned, howbeit upon this account only, as the Letter, truly Transcribed that came from the Light, and the Light it came from are, though two things, yet so agreeing together in one, as to the same testimony they both bear to the same truth, that he cannot really and truly, whatever hee may seem to do, receive, own, and obey the one, who is found fighting, deny|ing, rejecting, and rebelling against the other, whereupon as obedient and reverential, respectful, even to superstition, as <HI>I.O.</HI> would be judged to bee to the Letter, which he and others receive as the Jews do with the <HI>honour</HI> and <HI>veneration due to God,</HI> yet (saving all these shews) they are still <HI>Rebels</HI> a|gainst the very Letter, whilst so rebellious against the Light as to reject it with that <HI>detestation that is due to nothing but sin it self, and the very Devil</HI>; for he that owns the Letter aright, must own, come to, beleeve in, follow the Light, that shines from Christ, and shews the good, and the evil in his own, by the fall, darkned heart, defiled, blinded, and benighted conscience, sith the Letter testistes of, and calleth men to this Light: As he cannot be said to fulfill and live according to the Letter, that lives besides the Light it calls to, so cannot he be said not to fulfill, or to live beside the Letter, who lives according to the Light it came from.</P>
<P>But not upon this account can he bee said to rebel against the <HI>Light</HI> who rejects the <HI>Letter,</HI> because the <HI>letter</HI> and <HI>light</HI> are one and the self-same thing, <HI>viz&punc;</HI> the <HI>Letter</HI> the <HI>light,</HI> and the <HI>Light</HI> the <HI>letter,</HI> as <HI>I.O.</HI> dreams, for how|beit that be his sense, yet assuredly neither is the <HI>Letter</HI> the <HI>light,</HI> nor the <HI>Light</HI> the <HI>letter,</HI> but they are two distinct things that are no more <HI>Synona|mous,</HI>

<P>And lastly, in what sense soever such as reject the Letter may be called <HI>Lights Rebels</HI> (which is in no wise in respect of the <HI>letter</HI> and <HI>lights</HI> being <HI>in|dividually</HI> the same yet (as is said above) they are in no wise so called in that of <HI>Job,</HI> and if the Light had been as much heeded by <HI>I.O.</HI> as the Letter is lookt in by him without the Light, which only leads into the true meaning of it; yea if <HI>common reason</HI> had but ruled him, hee would have seen by the word Light the Letter is not intended; for to let pass other considerations that might be as <HI>cogent</HI> in this case, when ever, or by whomsoever that Hi|story or Book of <HI>Job</HI> was written, whether in his dayes, or after, by himself, or any other, yet that Chapter being a part of <HI>Jobs</HI> speech to his friends, it must be spoken in his dayes, whom <HI>Jerom</HI> on Genesis, <HI>Augustine, Am|brose, Philo, Plato,</HI> and most antient Fathers and Writers, <HI>Luther</HI> on <HI>Gen.</HI> 36. observe to have lived long before <HI>Moses,</HI> whom ye judge the first Scripture|writer, carried <HI>Israel</HI> out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and so consequently before any of your <HI>Scripture</HI> or <HI>Letter,</HI> which ye now call the <HI>Light</HI> was written; and that <HI>Job</HI> should denominate the wicked of his dayes under the name of <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Lights Rebels, rebellious against the letter</HI> long before any letter was written (unless his own book, which yet (if in his days) must be written after that was spoken) is such a <HI>trim</HI> peece of <HI>Teachment,</HI> and <HI>credible conceit</HI> as I could say more to, had I to do with another man, but to him I shall say no more but that which is his usual saying of what is at no hand to be beleeved, p. 244. <HI>Credat Apella.</HI></P>

<P>As to this <HI>Text</HI> therefore which with the 20, and 21. vers. is no less then nine, or ten times over rehearsed one where, or others in thy book, I have had it so often under my eye that I have hardly forbore so long from talking with thee about it, and there is yet a place behinde whereunto I thought I might have reserved the examination of it, it being there urged with two more, in the way thou callest <HI>Inartificial,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in proof of the <HI>Scriptures</HI> being the Word of God, p. 65, 66. But now I shall here consider it whilst, its under my hand, where its urged in vindication of the <HI>Letter</HI> to bee the <HI>Light,</HI> which <HI>Letter</HI> if it be the <HI>Light</HI> there spoken of, then I will yeeld it to be the <HI>Word of God</HI> there spoken of also, for I shall grant its <HI>both</HI> of these if <HI>either,</HI> and if it be not <HI>both,</HI> thou must needs grant its <HI>neither</HI>: the verse runs thus, <HI>But we have a more sure word of Propesie or Prophetical word, <GAP DESC="foreign">, to which ye do well to give heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, untill the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts.</HI> And the two that follow it thus, <HI>for no Prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation, for the Prophesie came not at any time by the will of man, but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the holy Spirit.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rep.</HI> Thy often repetition of this Scripture upon every occasion im|ports the great stress thou puttest upon it, and how great store thou settest by it, as to the proof of the <HI>Scriptures</HI> being the <HI>Word of Prophesie,</HI> and the

<P>From this <HI>Text</HI> considered, together with the <HI>Context,</HI> thou confidently concludest, assertest and insistest on five things.</P>
<P N="1">1. That all the <HI>Scripture, Letter,</HI> or <HI>Writing,</HI> in the <HI>original Texts</HI> of it, which is now bound up in your <HI>Bibles,</HI> and commonly called the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> was written at fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st by <HI>holy men</HI> as they were <HI>acted</HI> in it by the <HI>immediate inspi|ration</HI> of the <HI>Spirit of God,</HI> and this I shall neither <HI>deny,</HI> nor put thee to <HI>prove,</HI> though if I should, I see where thou wouldest falter, and be foundred in it; but (to let that pass here) this I am sure enough of, that this <HI>place proves</HI> no such matter, as that (as tis above laid down) neither in <HI>Terminis,</HI> nor by <HI>Consequence,</HI> for though it sayes holy men of God <HI>spake of old, i.e. Pro|phesied as moved by the holy Spirit,</HI> yet it from thence follows not, that all that ever <HI>holy men</HI> of God wrote in point of <HI>History, Chronicle, &amp;c</HI> nor <HI>Prophesie</HI> neither, was written by the same <HI>immmediate impulse</HI> of the Spirit on the spirits of the Penmen of all that is there, for some was written from the <HI>mouth</HI> of such as were <HI>inspired</HI> by the hands of others that were <HI>not the men inspired,</HI> nor <HI>moved</HI> to give forth the <HI>burden of the word of Prophesie</HI> that was on them, as <HI>Baruch</HI> wrote from <HI>Ieremies</HI> mouth, <HI>Tertius</HI> from <HI>Pauls,</HI> and so others; what they <HI>spake,</HI> and was <HI>written</HI> by, and from them was one thing, and the <HI>Writing</HI> or <HI>Scripture</HI> of that true Word is another, which yet I own to bee of God, as far as ye can from it, or any other rationally assert the <HI>Text</HI> to be, even in matter of <HI>Chronicle</HI> or <HI>Story,</HI> wherein men may possibly write <HI>true Scriptures</HI> of things done in their times, and times before them from <HI>Records</HI> and other <HI>principles,</HI> without that <HI>immediate inspiration</HI> or <HI>dictation</HI> of every <HI>Iota</HI> or <HI>Tittle</HI> to them, as thou <HI>Tatlest</HI> somewhere, from the <HI>holy Spirit</HI> of God: And lest thou shouldest not take this for truth to me, who am here in contest with thee, being prejudiced against me, hear what thy fel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow-fighter against the <HI>Qua. T.D.</HI> sayes (for I can almost at any time, as <HI>Paul</HI> did the Pharisees and Sadduces, who when they were both upon the back of him threw a bone, that set them together by the ears between themselves, and so save himself add his testimony to the truth from them both, <HI>Act.</HI> 23.6, 7, 8, 9, 10.) set our <HI>Stribes, Pharsees</HI> and <HI>Seducers</HI> at oddes within themselves, and send them to learn the truth we tell, and they will not take from us, from the testimony of one another; which <HI>T.D.</HI> saith it follows not that because <HI>Books</HI> are the <HI>Books</HI> of <HI>Prophets,</HI> therefore they are <HI>divinely inspired,</HI> for they might as well write from their own <HI>spirits,</HI> or upon <HI>human credit,</HI> as sometimes speak from their own spirits, p 43. of his 1. <HI>Pamph.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That none of all the <HI>Scripture, Letter</HI> or <HI>Writing</HI> aforesaid, is of <HI>pri|vate interpretation,</HI> that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, neither to be interpreted as meer <HI>private mens Wri|tings written</HI> as other mens are p. 9. the <HI>figment</HI> and <HI>imagination</HI> of whose hearts are the <HI>foundation</HI> of all they speak.</P>
<P>And this I as readily grant they are not to be deemed as <HI>thine, T.Ds</HI> and some other mens are, who in your <HI>private, narrow conceptions</HI> and
<PB N="143" REF="289">
<HI>thoughts</HI> of things thrust out what yee <HI>tkinke, feign,</HI> and <HI>fancy</HI> still to be truth (though nothing so) about both the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> and many other matters, for they are <HI>true Scriptures</HI> of <HI>holy, publick spirited men,</HI> who wrote, or caused to be written what was <HI>known</HI> and <HI>surely beleveed,</HI> Luke 1.1. at least among <HI>Saints,</HI> who were no <HI>liars,</HI> if not all at the <HI>immediate moti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n of the Spirit,</HI> they declared the things they had seen, heard, and witnessed within themselves to be the truth, even when they wro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e from others in matter of <HI>Doctrine, Prophesie,</HI> or so, and in <HI>Chronicle</HI> either <HI>immediately,</HI> or from more <HI>credible testimony</HI> then <HI>I.O.</HI> and <HI>T.D.</HI> when they write at all adventure upon <HI>leastly hear-sayes,</HI> from very go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d hands, when the matters are, in <HI>point of fact, many,</HI> if not <HI>most</HI> of them, <HI>very lyes.</HI></P>

<P>So I give thee thy sense, and more then thou wouldest willingly have as concerning the <HI>int<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rpreting of the Scripture,</HI> which men in their <HI>private thoughts</HI> are not to expound, nor yet to deem it as <HI>meer private mens Writings.</HI></P>
<P>Howbeit none of all this comes out of this place so clearly as thou con|ceivest, for it speaks not of the <HI>Letter</HI> and <HI>Writing,</HI> so much as thou in thy <HI>private spirit interpretest it to do</HI> but of the <HI>Truth,</HI> or <HI>holy things written,</HI> for whereas thou, who doest not see that <GAP DESC="foreign"> is one thing, and <GAP DESC="foreign"> is another, takest the <HI>Prophesie</HI> of <HI>Scripture,</HI> it intends the <HI>Prophesie</HI> it self, that was, as to the summe of it, <HI>written,</HI> but not the <HI>Writing</HI> that is of it, which Prophesie whether <HI>written</HI> by the <HI>hands,</HI> or spoken by the <HI>mouthes</HI> of <HI>holy men of God,</HI> who live in the <HI>Spirit,</HI> was not to bee inter|preted as the <HI>written</HI> or <HI>spoken Doctrines</HI> of <HI>private men,</HI> that speak and write from the <HI>conceivings</HI> of their own narrow <HI>private spirits, the figment, and ima|gination

<P N="3">3. That the <HI>Letter, Scripture, or Writing, 'or Copies of the original Texts, as ye have them at this day, are that Word of God, called there the Word of Pro|phesie,</HI> v. 19.</P>
<P N="4">4. That they are a <HI>more sure Word in their evidence to us at least, though not in themselves, then any voice from heaven whatever, yea then Gods own, if hee should speak to us from heaven, or then that voice by which hee spake from Heaven, which</HI> Peter, James, <HI>and</HI> John <HI>heard, when they were with Christ on the holy Mount.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. That the <HI>said Letter</HI> of the <HI>Scripture, is the light said there to shine in the dark place of mans hearts, with an eminent advantage to its own discovery, as well as unto the benefit of others.</HI></P>
<P>All which three last <HI>Assertions</HI> I not only deny to follow from this Text (as I did the two first, which yet I deny not the Truth of) but do as much deny them all three, or any one of them to bee <HI>Truth</HI> at all, as I do abso|lutely deny all, or either of them to bee <HI>possibly</HI> by any sound <HI>reason</HI> to bee deduced or inferred from this place; and likewise affirm that <HI>measure of the Light</HI> and <HI>Spirit of God and Christ</HI> in the hearts and consciences of men, which we bear <HI>testimony</HI> unto, to be the more <HI>sure word of Prophesie</HI> and <HI>Light</HI> here testified to by <HI>Peter.</HI></P>
<P>And the grounds of my <HI>denial</HI> of the one of these, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Letter</HI> is it, and of my <HI>affirming</HI> the other, <HI>viz.</HI> that the <HI>Light</HI> is it, are clear from two or three clauses of the Text it self, which are proper, and the very import of the phrases, and truly and plainly agreeable to the <HI>Light</HI> or <HI>Spirit,</HI> or <HI>Word of God within,</HI> but not a tall <HI>true</HI> or <HI>proper,</HI> or in truth agreeable to the <HI>Letter without</HI> if predicated, thereof; for</P>
<P>First it is (as much as <HI>I.O.</HI> jeers at the <HI>verbum seu lumen internum</HI>) said to be the <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Light within,</HI> and so the <HI>Letter without</HI> is not (if it were either the <HI>Word</HI> or the <HI>Light</HI>) therefore it cannot bee the Letter <HI>ad extra,</HI> which <HI>I O.</HI> labours for against the <HI>Light,</HI> and <HI>T.D.</HI> also who p. 45. of his 1 <HI>Pamph.</HI> cot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s this same Text, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1 19. affirming the <HI>Scripture</HI> to be the <HI>sure word of Prophesie intended here,</HI> but the Light <HI>ad intra,</HI> wee stand up for a|gainst them both; that which is said to be <HI>within,</HI> is not intended of a thing that is <HI>without only,</HI> as the <HI>formal Letter</HI> or the <HI>Scripture</HI> is, <HI>formally</HI> conside|red according to its <HI>proper name and nature</HI> (as <HI>I.O.</HI> dreams) or that <HI>proper essential form</HI> (<HI>quae dat effeci, per quam Scriptura est id quod est</HI>) which gives to it that very being, whereby it is what it is; but of something that is <HI>really within,</HI> as the Light only is, which the <HI>Litera scripta,</HI> or <HI>Letter without</HI> declares of.</P>
<P>And that not the Letter or Scripture <HI>formally considered,</HI> but that <HI>Word of God</HI> only and <HI>Divine Truth, Law, Doctrine,</HI> or <HI>Commandement,</HI> which is a <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Lamp</HI> is within, as <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.8. witnesses it for me, so my two <HI>Antagonists, I.O.</HI> and <HI>T.D.</HI> do both from the <HI>Testimony</HI> of that very <HI>Text testifie the same with it, and me against themselves,</HI> the one <HI>viz.

<P>And so hee runs on blindly in such over ample applaudings, and most mighty magnifications of the Scripture, that is the subject about which the Argument is driven on, by what termes soever, whether of the <HI>Truth,</HI> the <HI>Foundation,</HI> the <HI>power of God,</HI> the <HI>Rule,</HI> the <HI>VVitness of God,</HI> the <HI>VVord of God, &amp;c.</HI> hee expresses it by, that if he were set to extoll and set forth Christ Jesus himself in all his <HI>Dignity, Authority, Dominion, Might, Ma|jesty</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> [unless it be the express names of the only beloved and be|gotten Son of God, <HI>King of Kings, Lord of Lords, Mighty God,</HI> the <HI>Ever-Father,</HI> the <HI>Prince of Peace,</HI> and perhaps some few more] I can scarcely sup|pose on a sudden that he could finde any other, or at least any more eminent Titles to dignifie him by, then those by which hee dignifies, not to say <HI>Dei|fies</HI> his adored dead <HI>Transcript, Text,</HI> and <HI>Corps</HI> of the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Hebrew Copies</HI> of the Scriptures, which hee <HI>vermilions</HI> over with the <HI>honour</HI> and <HI>vene|ration</HI> (as to sundry of the most excellent glorious Titles and properties hee attributes to it) that is due either to God or Christ, or his <HI>living VVord, Light</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> alone: For howbeit every such particular expression of <HI>VVonderful, Councellor, Leader,</HI> and <HI>Commander</HI> to the people, <HI>Redeemer, Saviour, Salvation, &amp;c.</HI> that Christ is stiled by, may possibly not bee used in <HI>I.Os.</HI> book to express the outer Scriptures by, yet I beleeve there is but little asserted in <HI>honour</HI> of Christ, the <HI>Spirit,</HI> the <HI>living Light</HI> and <HI>VVord</HI> throug|out the Scripture, which is not asserted, if not in the same, yet in Termes equivalent in honour of the Scripture it self.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>ANd now I return to take more notice of what more is urged in his <HI>La|tine Theses,</HI> as concerning the Scriptures being the only most perfect rule of faith, life, worship&punc; and knowledge of God as to salvation. The se|cond Argument in proof whereof is its perfect operation and efficacy, <HI>Ex.</HI> 3. <HI>s.</HI> 29. <HI>omnia perficit necessaria, &amp;c.</HI> it accomplishes all that is necessary to Gods glory, and our salvation, in vindication of which, a whole <HI>Dozen</HI> of Scriptures are urged, <HI>eleven</HI> of which are above answered, and one onely remains to be a little spoken to, <HI>viz.</HI> Isa. 55.10, 11.</P>
<P>And as to that of <HI>Isa.</HI> 55 10, 11. I grant, That the <HI>Word of God,</HI> as the <HI>Rain</HI> and <HI>Snow comes down, and returns not without watering the earth, and causing it to bring forth and bud, and give seed and food,</HI> so it returns not void at any time <HI>without working that for which he sends it</HI> to any person or people, and prospering to the accompli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ment of what he pleases; but I am half amazed to see that thou <HI>I.O.</HI> shouldest bee so silly as to interpret that of the Scripture, since it so expresly speaks <HI>de verbo oris sui,</HI> of the <HI>Word of his mouth,</HI> which is asserted immediately from himself with his own voice [so shall my <HI>Word be that goeth out of my mouth</HI>] which Word expressed by his own voice speaking, who so upon second thoughts, and serious consideration, shall say the Scriptures are, &amp; <HI>properly</HI> too, as <HI>I.O.</HI> excusing his ignorance, for as much as not for want of incogitancy, I my self sometimes so thought while I ran as our National Ministry now doth, making haste and saying <HI>he saith</HI>] before himself had sent mee [howbeit I wanted no sending of man] or had spoke to me, or I heard his voice, I shall make bold to accuse him of <HI>arrant, Absurdity, miserable mistake, wretched blindness,</HI> and <HI>utter un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rthiness</HI> to bee denominated a Doctor in that thing, which our Di|vines call <HI>Divinity.</HI></P>
<P>Nevertheless not having so well minded the matter, as upon occasion they may do in time to come, being carried in times past by custome to take things, and term and talk of them according to tradition, more then true discerning of them in their <HI>proper natures,</HI> the very preachers of this Na|tion, as well as the poor people that have lived on their lips, have been so habituated, by common <HI>Metonymies,</HI> to miscall the Scriptures by names not proper to their <HI>natures</HI> that they now stand up to depend them to be <HI>most properly</HI> denominated by those <HI>Metonymical and improper names</HI>; so that howbeit we are never so willing to allow them to express themselves by such figurative phrases as are frequently found in the Scripture it self (as <HI>Act.</HI> 13.27. <HI>the voices</HI> i.e. <HI>Scriptures</HI> of the Prophets, are said to be read in the <HI>Iews</HI> Synagogues every Sabbath) and that satisfies them not, but the <HI>Qua.</HI> are deniers both of the Scriptures, and of the <HI>Word of God,</HI> and spoylers of them of their <HI>proper names,</HI> if they yeeld not to their as absurd as arbitrary Appellations of them, by those glorious Titles of <HI>Gods Words, Gods Voice,</HI> as their <HI>proper names,</HI> yea in this dotish disquierness, and peevish perversnes of his prejudiced spirit doth <HI>I&punc;O.</HI> quarrel with the <HI>Quakers</HI> as bereavers of the Scripture of its <HI>proper name,</HI> because they own not his <HI>improperties,</HI> in igno|rantly and impudently imposing the names of the <HI>Word of God,</HI> and the

<P>J.O. <HI>I am now to deal against the</HI> Qua. <HI>about the proper name of the</HI> Scripture: <HI>for this sort of men are glad that the care of this business is committed to them by</HI> Satan <HI>that they may spoil the</HI> Scriptures <HI>of that glorious Title the</HI> Word of God: <HI>This name doth the</HI> Scripture <HI>challenge to it self.</HI> So p. 49.73, 74, 77. That the <HI>Scripture is light, we shall see that is so, or can be called so, unless it hath this nature, and properly to evidence it self, as well as to give light to others, cannot in any tolerable corespondency of speech be allowed: Whether spiritual, intellectual light, regarding the minde, or natural with respect to bodily sight be firstly or</HI> pro|perly <HI>light, I need not inquire, both have the same properties; it is spiritual, moral, intellectual light, with all its</HI> mediums <HI>that hath the preheminence as to a participation of the nature</HI> and <HI>properties of light.</HI> Now the Scripture, the <HI>Word of God,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Note how <HI>I.O.</HI> all along makes the <HI>Scripture</HI> and the <HI>Word of God</HI> so syno|mous, that from the par|ticipation of the same <HI>na|ture</HI> and <HI>pro|perties</HI> he judges them to be all one, and that the names of the one, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rld of God,</HI> &amp; the <HI>Light,</HI> are the very <HI>proper names</HI> of the other, <HI>i.e.</HI> of the <HI>Letter,</HI> and where he expresses himself by these Termes the <HI>Word of God,</HI> the <HI>Light,</HI> the <HI>Power of God</HI> in his Treatises and Theses (except in the place where he speaks of <GAP DESC="foreign"> &amp; <GAP DESC="foreign">) it must still bee understood of the <HI>Scripture.</HI></NOTE> is Light, a Light <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hining in a dark place,</HI> 2 Pet. 1.19. <HI>with an eminent advantage for its own discovery, &amp;c. a glorious shining Light, an illumi|nating Light, compared and preferred ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve the light of the Sun,</HI> Psal. 19.5, 6&punc; 7.

<P>In which Argument a man may take his choice of <HI>fallacies,</HI> and of two call it which he pleases, or both if he will, and do him no wrong whose it is,

for as there is a <HI>begging of the grand question</HI> in the dispute, and a taking it a|forehand for <HI>granted,</HI> which is not <HI>granted</HI> but denied, and to be proved, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Lanthorn</HI> is the <HI>light,</HI> the <HI>Writing</HI> the <HI>Word,</HI> which is called <HI>Pe|titio principii,</HI> so there is a concluding <HI>aliud a negato,</HI> another thing, which is owned, and not contradicted, nor gainsayed, <HI>viz.</HI> that the <HI>Light</HI> is the <HI>Light</HI>; when the thing denyed, and to be proved, <HI>i.e.</HI> that the <HI>Lanthorn</HI> is the Light, the <HI>Writing</HI> the <HI>Word,</HI> is not affirmed in the conclusion at all, which is called <HI>ignoratio Elenchi,</HI> when that is inferred as <HI>contradictory</HI> to the thing denied, which doth in no wise <HI>contradict</HI> it.</P>
<P>Or else 5. thus, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Lanthornquatenus</HI> it <HI>contains</HI> the <HI>Light</HI> may be the <HI>light.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore the Lanthorn may be said to be the Light.

<P>I say if the said man shall not only flye up thus into the height of <HI>fals|hood</HI> in his assertion of the <HI>Lanthorn</HI> to be the <HI>Light,</HI> the Letter to bee the <HI>VVord,</HI> decrying that altogether which is so indeed, but also drive on his <HI>proof</HI> and <HI>evidence</HI> thereof in such a sorry way of either <HI>down-right falsity,</HI> or <HI>evident fallacy</HI> and <HI>deceit</HI> as this is, though I should not dare to deal any otherwise then fairly and openly with this man, if I should come to argue all the utter untruths utttered by him about the Lanthorn back again upon (as by and by I am to syllogize back upon <HI>I.O.</HI> his false tales about the Scripture) and though I desire not that any man should bee caught with any other then that <HI>godly guile</HI> whereby <HI>Paul</HI> caught many out of the <HI>deceit,</HI> yet whether he that deals thus treacherously doth not deserve when he hath done, <HI>ex lege Talionis,</HI> to be dealt <HI>treacherously</HI> withall, <HI>Isa.</HI> 33.1.

the same Texts, so that one cannot well make a full end with one Argument without some transition into another) is very much coincident with this. The summe of which fourth is this, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If it be often commanded by God that we attend diligently to the Scriptures, left we be turned aside from the truth and right knowledge of himself by seducing spirits, vain Revelations, false teachers, &amp;c. then the Scripture is the most perfect Rule, &amp;c. but the first true, therefore the other,</HI> Ex. 3.f.31.</P>
<P>The Texts that prove the <HI>minor</HI> of this Argument, quoth he, <HI>are so clear and plain that</HI> ad solem caecutiat necesse est, &amp;c. <HI>he must needs be blinde toward the Sun it self,</HI> who <HI>Assents not to them</HI> in some of which also [quoth he] the <HI>certitude of the sacred Word</HI> [that is the Scripture still with <HI>I.O.</HI>] <HI>is pre|ferred before the certitude</HI> (as to the Churches use) <HI>even of true Revelations and miraculous.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rep</HI> Yet two of them, <HI>viz</HI> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.13, 14, 15, 16. &amp; 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.19. many times a peece over repeated and supposed to supply almost every turn of <HI>I.O.</HI> how they serve not his turn at all is abundantly above discovered, where|upon I here quit them.</P>
<P>Another is so much misquoted, <HI>viz.</HI> 2 <HI>Ioh.</HI> 11.5, 6, 10. that, as plain and clear as the Sun as it is, he must be better skill'd then I that knows where to finde it at all.</P>
<P>Two more there are that make as much to <HI>I.Os.</HI> purpose, as any two well-nigh can do, that speak contrary to it, and those are <HI>Ioh.</HI> 5.47. 2 <HI>Thess.</HI> 2.2. The words of the first, which with those of 46. vers. are Christs to the Scribes, are these, <HI>Had ye beleeved Moses, yee would have beleeved me, for he wrote of me, but if ye beleeve not his writings, how shall ye beleeve my words.</HI> Christ by true Revelations of it from the Father to him truly revealed the Fathers will to the Scribes which they received not from him but hated him for, <HI>Ioh.</HI> 8.40. 12.49, 50.14.31. saying of Christ, <HI>Wee are none of his, we are Moses Disciples, we know God spake to Moses, as for this fellow we know not whence he is,</HI> Joh. 5:45, 46, 47. Christ tells them in effect that for all their prate and pretence to <HI>Moses</HI> as their <HI>Tutor,</HI> he rather was their <HI>Accuser in whom they trusted,</HI> sith they in truth beleeved not <HI>Moses,</HI> for [<HI>a minori ad majus</HI>] <HI>did you indeed beleeve</HI> Moses, <HI>ye would much more beleeve me,</HI> quoth he, <HI>for he wrote of me,</HI> he sent, directed, and pointed you to me, for so he did, <HI>Deut.</HI> 18.15. saying of Christ, <HI>A Prophet will God raise to you, &amp;c. him shall ye hear in all he sayes, who hears him not shall be cut off from his people,</HI> Act. 3.22, 23.7.47. But <HI>if you beleeve not his writings,</HI> wherein ye are bid to hear me, as the greater of the two, as the <HI>Son</HI> in the house, where he was but the <HI>servant,</HI> then ye <HI>cannot be|leeve my words.</HI> The summe in short is this, hee that heeds <HI>Moses</HI> writings, must <HI>hear me,</HI> for <HI>Moses</HI> bids them do so, he that <HI>beleeves what I say,</HI> doth what <HI>Moses</HI> sayes; he that beleeves <HI>either,</HI> beleeves <HI>both,</HI> he that beleeves not <HI>both,</HI> beleeves <HI>neither.</HI></P>
<P>But what of that? what follows hence? this, quoth <HI>I O.</HI> for that is the very end hee infers this Text for, and the very conclusion he infers from it; <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>Moses</HI> writings of Christ are more sure, and of <HI>greater certainty,</HI> as to the <HI>Churches use,</HI> then <HI>Christs own words from his own mouth,</HI> or then <HI>Christs Revelations of Gods minds to men, as revealed to him from the mouth of God, from the very bosome of the Father: Siccine?

<P><HI>Rep.</HI> The business <HI>I.O.</HI> cites this in proof of is [for this, and that next before are of those that are subscribed to that purpose] that the <HI>certainty of the Scripture is preferred before the certainty of true Revelations and Miracles</HI>; but which way so much can be drawn, unless it be as <HI>I.O.</HI> draws iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with Cart Ropes, from that Text is more then I can tell.</P>
<P><HI>Paul, Silas</HI> and <HI>Timothy</HI> had told them it seems of the coming of the day of God, both by <HI>Spirit, Word</HI> and <HI>Letter,</HI> they whose great hope lay in the comming of that day, like such as look and long for what they love, and are apt to thinke and hope it to be, as they would have it, did hope it to be nearer hand then it was, and fearing left, finding it further off then they thought, they might bee troubled, and shaken in minde, and failing in their faith of it, he gives them to understand the worst of it, that the best might the better help it self, that they should not mistake them in their Doctrine about that day, as if they had said it was immediately to shine out upon them, and so waver in their mindes, flag in their faith, and be troubled with doubts, as if it would never come to them, because not so soon as they wisht it might, for there was a <HI>long night</HI> to interpose it self first, he wills them withall to remember v. 5. that he told them no less in the <HI>Spirit</HI> by <HI>Word of his mouth</HI> (as now he doth over again by <HI>Letter</HI> or <HI>Writing</HI>) when was present with them, howbeit, as thats never long that comes at last, so that day would come at last to their salvation, and destruction of the man of sin (who caused the night) with the <HI>brightness of it</HI>: Here's the <HI>short</HI> and the <HI>long</HI> of the business of that verse, and those about it, from which I, who can see the <HI>Sun,</HI> can see no such Doctrine follow, as <HI>I.O.</HI> dreamingly draws from it, nor one <HI>dram of Reason,</HI> nor the least <HI>grain</HI> of <HI>Assent</HI> to his <HI>Asas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inated Assertion, that the Scripture is of more certitude as to the Churches use, then any true Revelations.</HI></P>

<PB N="25" REF="326">

<P><HI>Rep.</HI> I reply, that's false, and expresly contradictory to <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.11, 12, 13. where its said, the Gospel Ministry (which obtains its end in this life, or else is not perfect according to <HI>I.O.</HI> and ceases in that to come) is given for that end, <HI>viz.</HI> for the <HI>perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Ministry, for the edifying of the Body of Christ</HI>: How long? <HI>till we all come in the unity of the Faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto</HI> a perfect man, <HI>unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Rep.</HI> I say that's meer <HI>flim-flam,</HI> as to the point in hand, for we assert the Saints and Ministers of Christ no farther <HI>infallible,</HI> then they follow the leading of the spirit, which is infallible, out of which they are not in their Ministry, and so far as following that, which is given to be all mens guide, men and Ministers (whom we confess to be all <HI>fallible</HI> in them|selves, as abstract from that, and not only liable to erre, but erring actually as they leave off to be led by that, and lean to their own understandings) are all (so far I say) infallible, and infallibly guided; for as God hath no <HI>fallible spirit,</HI> so his <HI>infallible spirit</HI> hath no <HI>fallible</HI> guidance, nor leads any <HI>fallibly</HI> at all, but all <HI>infallibly,</HI> who are led by it into all truth, so as in all those things it teaches, and are needful for them to know, to make them, otherwise <HI>fallible</HI> and <HI>ignorant</HI> thereof in themselves, not only <HI>infal|lible,</HI> but (as to all thoe things I say) Omniscient, as himself is Omnis|cient in all things absolutely without exception.</P>
<P>Neither are Omnisciency and Omnipotency themselves, as to all those things that are to be known and done by such, so altogether <HI>incommuni|cable</HI> to spiritual men as our <HI>Academical Animals</HI> imagine they are; for though God, Christ, and the Spirit only know and can do all things abso|lutely, yet, through God, Christ, and the Spirit, teaching, leading, guiding, revealing, enabling, all things, <HI>i.e.</HI> all things that are truly good, fit, suit|able, comfortable, profitable for such, are both infallibly to be known, and possible to be done by the Ministers of God in their respective servi|ces and seasons; whereupon the Wisdome of God hath spoken thus of the Spirit, as in reference to the Saints that learn of him, receive and are led by him, he shall lead you into <HI>all truth,</HI> bring <HI>all things</HI> to your re|membrance, whatever I have said, ye have an Unction little children, and ye know <HI>all things,</HI> and not only of the Spirit it self, that it searcheth <HI>all things,</HI> even the deep things of God; but of the spiritual man also, to whom the Spirit reveals them, that he discerneth <HI>all things,</HI> when the animal man nor doth nor can perceive the things of the Spirit; and that the spiritual men had the mind of Christ, <HI>Ioh.</HI> 14.26. <HI>Ioh.</HI> 16.13. 1 <HI>Ioh.</HI> 2.20.27. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.9.15.16. and not only so, but saith <HI>Paul,</HI> who had no sufficiency of himself to any thing, <HI>I can do all things thorough Christ that strengtheneth me, Phil. 3.13. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">anta ischus</HI> and <HI>Col.</HI> 1.11. of the Saints. <HI>en+pase dunamei dunamumensi</HI> strengthened with all might, <HI>i.e.</HI> Omnipo|tency.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="327">Whereas therefore <HI>T.D.</HI> prates, as his fellow preachers do of the other <HI>incommunicables,</HI> of these things, I say 'tis <HI>Parret</HI>-like, of he knows not what himself; for as in such wise and measure as Saints are partakers of his <HI>holiness, purity, perfection, mercy, &amp;c.</HI> they are holy as he is holy, <HI>pure</HI> as he is <HI>pure, merciful</HI> as he is <HI>merciful, perfect</HI> as he is <HI>perfect,</HI> though not so absolutely and infinitely <HI>pure, holy, meriful,</HI> and <HI>perfect,</HI> as he is, so, so far, and in such a measure, as they are led by his spirit, and indued with his power from on high, they are, and in the Scripture are said to be, not on|ly <HI>infallibly assured</HI> of things, which is Tantamount to <HI>infallible, Luke</HI> 1.1, 2, 3, 4. <HI>Act.</HI> 1.3. and to have <HI>plerophorian</HI> full <HI>assurance</HI>; but also <HI>Omnisci|ent, Omnipotent, panta anakcinontes, eidontes, iscuontes,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

And as for his proof, that if they were <HI>infallible at all, then they would have been so at all times,</HI> and in all things. That is as pedling a proof, as he would count it, if I should go to prove that <HI>David</HI> was not at al partaker of the property of holiness, because he was not ho|ly, but wicked at that time, and in that thing wherein he was desil'd in the matter of <HI>Vriah,</HI> which <HI>T.

<P><PB N="49" REF="338">The Question between the <HI>Qua.</HI> and <HI>T.D.</HI> was as he relates, <HI>p.</HI> 1. of his 1. <HI>Pamph. viz.

<P><HI>Rep.</HI> 1. Here let all reasonable men judge, whether thou <HI>T.

<P>For mark, <HI>We grant</HI> (sayest thou) <HI>that every man hath some light,</HI> i.e. is in <HI>some sort enlightened by Christ</HI> (for thy grant is to the <HI>Question</HI> above, whether <HI>by Christ</HI> or not, or else thy Answer is beside the purpose) And besides p. 4. thou denyest not, but <HI>the Gentiles afore Christ were enlightned by Christ (as God)</HI> (though yet to the contradiction of thy self again, as if the being enlightned to know, and a man knowing were all one, thou there sayest they were <HI>afarre off from the knowledge of that</HI>) by <HI>whose light be discernes</HI> (though dimly) (and how dimly or clearly is nothing to the purpose) <HI>many sins, and duties, and several divine attributes.</HI></P>

<P>So thou engaging thy self in vindication of the <HI>Scriptures</HI> to be the <HI>Word of God.</HI> 1 Giving us the Question to have been debated, flinkest away into the proof of another matter, saying, that ye <HI>upon the matter contained in the writing</HI> (which, say we, is another <HI>business,</HI> the <HI>holy truth that is there told,</HI> and the Light and Word of God, Law and Gospel there witnessed to, being a thing to distinct from the <HI>Scripture of it,</HI> that as it is now where the <HI>letter</HI> is not, and was two thousand years before the <HI>letter</HI> was, so it will be for ever, for its an <HI>euerlasting Gospell,</HI> when the <HI>letter</HI> of it shall be no more) <HI>Whether that be your Rule of Faith and Life?</HI> a matter in no wise denyed by the <HI>Qua.</HI> if not only by the <HI>Scripture</HI> ye mean (as properly ye cannot do) the <HI>holy Doctrine, Truth, Word, Light, Law, Gospell</HI> of Christ therein declared, to be in some measure at least in the heart of every man, <HI>preached in every Creature,</HI> that they may hear and do it; but also by thy Term, <HI>Our Rule of Faith and Life,</HI> that which <HI>de jure</HI> ought to be your Rule; otherwise if ye say even of that <HI>de facto,</HI> that it is your <HI>Rule,</HI> or in <HI>esse actuall</HI> that which ye do <HI>actually</HI> and <HI>indeed walk</HI> by; I deny even that also, for howbeit ye should own that also, (and not the <HI>letter</HI> and <HI>text</HI> only, as <HI>I.O.</HI> doth) yet so farre are ye from so doing, that if thou do not, yet at least <HI>I.O.</HI> both <HI>doctrinally</HI> and <HI>practically</HI> denies, and <HI>damnes</HI> it down, as a meer <HI>nescio quid</HI> of the <HI>Qua.</HI> coyning.</P>
<P>Moreover much what in the same manner dost thou in the Point of <HI>Iu|stification,</HI> give us no lesse then the <HI>Question,</HI> as to the Termes wherein it was stated, and then startest a new Question in thy <HI>Sophisticall s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> it of subtil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y,</HI> which is so familiar with thee, that it's seen by any that are but <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> unculi</HI> only in the thing called Dispute, by staring and translating the old one under new termes.</P>

<P>And this <HI>G.W.</HI> tells thee of, and turns upon thee in his <HI>Reply</HI> to thy first so plainly, that thou dost but add to thy shame in thy Reply to him a|gain, <HI>p.</HI> 10. of thy 2. <HI>Pamp.</HI> which begins with a flat lye, which I'le note here, now I have it in hand: I <HI>did not</HI> (sayest thou) <HI>directly affirm that good works, which are the fulfilling the Law, deserve Salvation, but that from the Rule of Contraries</HI> (which <HI>S.F.</HI> urged) <HI>we might so argue.</HI> Now if thou confess, that by that rule we may so argue, then the thing is so <HI>secundum te,</HI> or else thou canst not truly say we may so argue, and that is as direct|ly to affirm it as one need be desired to do: So thou hast not much mend|ed thy matter, nor by thy lye lick't thy self sound of what <HI>G.W.</HI> laid on thee; but indeed thy words, as thy self repeatest them in thy first <HI>Pam. p.</HI> 15. are directly <HI>positive,</HI> and not <HI>suppositive</HI>; for after many other positions, thou layest down that thus, <HI>viz.

I say, taking, or rather rashly raking that for granted that was not, thou proceed'st upon that score plainly, belabouring thy self in
<PB N="53" REF="340">
evincing a business that none gain-sayes, <HI>viz.</HI> that all men do not <HI>actually and truly understand the Mystery of Godlinesse and the Gospell</HI>; and as child|ishly arguing all along, <HI>a non actu ad non potentiam, a non esse ad non posse,</HI> from mens <HI>not knowing God and Christ,</HI> that they are in no <HI>capacity,</HI> by a measure of light shining from them into their Consciences to know them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mystery of Godlinesse</HI> (sayest thou) <HI>we deny, all men have the know|ledge of</HI>; and so <HI>p.</HI> 5.1. <HI>Pamph, 'tis spoken of as a distinguishing Mercy, to know the Mystery of the Kingdome of Heaven, it was given to the Disciples, not to others,</HI> Matth. 13.11.</P>
<P><HI>Rep.</HI> To which I reply, Who doubts of this? it was hid from some, and the knowledge of it given so some, not to others; but who were these some to whom given, when not to others? were they not the Disciples that <HI>learnt</HI> at the <HI>lips</HI> and <HI>light</HI> of Christ, what he taught them, and saw willingly what he shewed them; when the rest (who might else have come to know, and have had it given them to know as well as these) were such as had it declared in them, with the righteousness thereof, but that they <HI>shut their eyes, stop their own ears, lest they should see and hear that, which was contrary to their evil deeds, they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ath to leave, and reproved them</HI>? But what of this, are they therefore without the <HI>Light</HI> that shew|ed it, and the meanes of the knowledge of it? what idle arguing is here? The <HI>Mystery of Godliness as summed up,</HI> 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. <HI>ult. God manifest in the Flesh, justified in the Spirit,</HI>&amp;c. We deny as well as thou, that all men have the knowledge of, for without controversie it is great, and so great, that (saving all that knowledge thou thinkest thou hast, and wouldest be thought to have of it) it remains yet a <HI>Mystery</HI> to thy self: But what then? will it therefore follow, that all men, in case they come to his light, are not enlightened by Christ in some measure to know it? Because all are not enlightened so much as some are by Christ, and all do not know what they might know, if they hearkened to Christ, and heeded that light they have, therefore some are not enlightened by Christ at all: Here is the sum of <HI>T.D</HI>'s.

<P>To be <HI>without knowledge</HI> is one thing, to be <HI>without the meanes of it is</HI> ano|ther; to be ignorant of the mystery of Godliness, the Gospel, and King|dome is one thing, and <HI>not to be (in potentia, eriam proxima) in an immediate possibility to know it,</HI> or to be <HI>utterly without</HI> any of that <HI>Light</HI> which leads to it, is another.</P>

<P>How often shall we need to tell you (<HI>ye blind and deaf</HI>) that to have light shining in one is one thing, and to be in it, in a state of Light, and the children of it, is another? to have the Gospel preached <HI>in men</HI> is one thing, and for men to <HI>learn the mystery</HI> of it is another; the Gospel <HI>is preached in every creature under heaven, Paul</HI> sayes, <HI>Col.</HI> 1.23. <HI>en pase te Ktisi</HI>; yea, have they not all heard, saith he, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.18? yes verily' (alluding

<P>Also, <HI>that they have the Light in them,</HI> who yet neither believe in it, nor are the children of it, but yet abiding in darkness, is as clear from Chrihs own words, <HI>Iob.</HI> 8.12.12.35.36. <HI>I am the light of the world, he i.e.</HI> he of the world, <HI>that followeth me, shall not abide in darkness, but have the light of Life: Walk while ye have the Light; while ye have the Light, believe in the Light, that ye may be</HI> (it seems they yet were not so, yet had a Light in them to believe in) <HI>the Children of the Light</HI>; some of which Light was come, not unto them only, but into the world also, ver. 26. <HI>That who e're believes in it might come out of darkness</HI>; and evil ones had it come to them, as well as such as did <HI>Truth,</HI> though they came not to it as the other did, else they could not be said <HI>to see and hate it; and so Christ and the Father,</HI> whose will was revealed in it, as they are, <HI>Iohn</HI> 3.20.12.48. and 15.22. 23.24.</P>
<P>So <HI>Christ</HI> is come by <HI>his Light</HI> (as the <HI>Sun</HI> by its beams, into some dark Dungeon) into the <HI>dark world,</HI> the <HI>dark places of mens hearts,</HI> and of the earth that are full of the habitations of <HI>cruelty, Dens of Devils, Cages of unclean and hareful birds,</HI> holds of cruel, wicked, fowl, and filthy spirits, to give life, and that abundantly, <HI>Iohn</HI> 10.10. yea, he came to the <HI>Scribes</HI> of old by <HI>his Light,</HI> not <HI>outward person</HI> only, to that end, yet they had not the <HI>Light of Life</HI>; why so? <HI>Ye hear not Gods Voice</HI> (saith he) <HI>and have not his Word</HI> (which ye put from you) <HI>abiding in you; ye search the Scri|ptures, which testifie of me, who am the Life, and there ye look to have it, and come not unto me that ye might have life,</HI> Joh. 5.37.38.39.40.</P>

<P>Whence I take occasion to argue further thus; <HI>viz.</HI></P>

That Light which gives to discern <HI>savingly</HI> (as <HI>heeded</HI>) the <HI>deep things of God and the Spirit,</HI> which none but the <HI>Spirit of God and Christ</HI> searches out, knows, and savingly reveals, and which, as to salva|tion, are not by the <HI>naturall man,</HI> but <HI>spiritually,</HI> and by the <HI>spirituall man</HI> only discerned, who hath the <HI>mind</HI> and <HI>Spirit of Christ,</HI> must be not a <HI>na|turall,</HI> but a <HI>spiritual</HI> and <HI>supernaturall light,</HI> and the <HI>knowledge</HI> that comes by it is not <HI>natural,</HI> but <HI>supernatural</HI> and <HI>spirituall.</HI></P>

<P>Therefore <HI>it,</HI> and the <HI>knowledge</HI> that is by it, is not <HI>naturall,</HI> but <HI>super|natural</HI> and <HI>spiritual.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Mino,</HI> which our sore-named Divines do deny, is as evident to such as live in the <HI>light,</HI> as the <HI>light it self is,</HI> and not a little of it evidenced by their own handy-works who oppose it.</P>
<P>Two Particulars there are in it to be proved; 1. That the <HI>Light</HI> in all manifests or gives (as heeded) to discern in some measure the <HI>things of God</HI> and the <HI>Spirit.</HI> 2. That (as <HI>heeded</HI>) it manifests them <HI>sa|vingly.</HI></P>

<P>I must therefore down rightly address my self, as the Lord shall lead me, not minding the <HI>method</HI> so much as the <HI>matter</HI> it self, to reply to all this <HI>stuffe,</HI> whereby <HI>T: D.</HI> and <HI>I: O: I: T: R: B:</HI> in speciall, who as Generals to other <HI>blind Guides</HI> of <HI>poor, blind people,</HI> against the <HI>Qua.</HI> strive to storm the plain Truth out of dores.</P>

<P>First I shall follow on in the way I was going on in to clear it, that <HI>Christ</HI> (as <HI>Christ</HI>) the <HI>light</HI> of the world, by his <HI>light</HI> and <HI>Spirit,</HI> and not (as God only) enlightens every one, in the proof of which the rest is all concluded, though yet I may grow on to take notice of the rest in particular also.</P>

<P>Now we have the expresse words of the <HI>Spirit</HI> on our side, and are sure enough (as to our selves) that we have the <HI>mind of Christ in them</HI> also, which is but one; but on their side are their own <HI>senses, minds,</HI> and <HI>meanings,</HI> which are so many, even no lesse then four to that one of ours, which most properly answers to the words, so that if they can't carry it by weight, yet they hope to have it by number, and chuse to out-word us since they see they cannot out-weigh us, hoping that <HI>several senses</HI> may well stand and take place against one <HI>single one</HI>; but as a dram of <HI>ho|nesty,</HI> and naked <HI>simplicity,</HI> is to go further then a deal of <HI>subtilty,</HI> and <HI>hypocrisie</HI> in the dayes that are coming, so <HI>one</HI> of the <HI>Qua. proper</HI> constructi|ons of <HI>Scripture</HI> will be preferred by <HI>honest people</HI> before a <HI>four-fold impro|per</HI> one of the <HI>Priests</HI> imposing: The <HI>Qua.</HI> are in possession of the <HI>plain Terms</HI> of the place, and of that meaning which most properly answers to them, saying, That by <HI>every man coming into the world,</HI> is intended, <HI>ho|nestly</HI> and <HI>plainly, truly</HI> and <HI>properly,</HI> without dissimulation, <HI>every man</HI> in|deed, as 'tis there expressed, and that the <HI>Spirit</HI> meanes <HI>nakedly</HI> and <HI>truly</HI> what he sayes; these stand <HI>proking, pelting,</HI> and <HI>stickling,</HI> with a company of <HI>stones,</HI> and <HI>sticks,</HI> and <HI>strawes</HI> to storm the <HI>Qua.</HI> out of the <HI>strong Hold</HI> they have in it.</P>

<P>His first <HI>sense</HI> is this; <HI>viz. That Christ enlightens every man that is en|lightened.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Repl.</HI> So say I; that makes for us, that is <HI>every man</HI> without exception; for thus I argue (<HI>shooting back T. Ds.

<PB N="73" REF="350">
the Truth</HI> in another, for he meanes not by them (though his <HI>phrase</HI> imports it) that <HI>every individual man is inlightned.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Christ enlightens every man that is enlightned.</L>
<L>But every individual man is enlightned.</L>
<L>Therefore <HI>Christ enlightens every individuall man.</HI></L></Q>
<P>The first Proposition is <HI>T. Ds. own</HI>; the <HI>Minor, viz.</HI> That <HI>every man is enlightned</HI> with some light, is his own grant also, <HI>p:</HI> 1: where he sayes, <HI>We grant, that every man hath some light, by which he discernes many sins, and du|ties, and several divine attributes:</HI> So that let his meaning be what it will, if he meanes as he sayes, (as it is fit he and <HI>and every honest man</HI> should, and as the <HI>Spirit</HI> does) we have his <HI>own words,</HI> as well as those of the Text, on our side also against himself; therefore <HI>T. D:</HI> if he <HI>own himself,</HI> must (of <HI>all men</HI>) own the Conclusion, <HI>viz,</HI> That <HI>Christ enlightens every individuall man.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Whether <HI>T. D.</HI> saw any advantage he had given us by this sense thus expressed, or no, it matters not; but expressing his mind, as to the inter|pretation of this Text, <HI>p:</HI> 36: there he adds a clause, by which he imagines he mends the matter, and so he does, as much as one that makes it never the better; for there he <HI>shoots</HI> out his sense thus, That <HI>Christ enlightens eve|ry man, who is (spiritually) enlightned.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Repl.</HI> Which is very true, yea so say I again; but this <HI>Arrow</HI> does no execution against us, nor that <HI>universal sense</HI> in which we expound the words, according to the <HI>universality</HI> of their expression; of which it is no way at all <HI>exclusive</HI>; for what though Christ enlightneth <HI>every man</HI> that is <HI>spiritually</HI> inlightned, it doth not follow (unless <HI>T. D.</HI> had said, as its like he meanes, but that his <HI>sayings</HI> and <HI>meanings</HI> so seldome agree together, that he <HI>measures</HI> the <HI>Spirit</HI> also by himself, as <HI>saying one thing, and meaning another,</HI> and so would set the <HI>Spirits</HI> words and the <HI>Spirits meanings</HI> at odds, and together by the eares against themselves) Christ en|lightens <HI>only</HI> such men as are spiritually inlightned.</P>
<P>Nor secondly, if he had said so, would it have followed, that <HI>every in|dividual man</HI> is not enlightned, for of a truth <HI>every individuall man</HI> is not only enlightned, but also <HI>spiritually</HI> enlightned; for he that is <HI>enlightned</HI> to discern <HI>spiritual things,</HI> good or bad, <HI>spiritual</HI> wickednesses or <HI>spiritual righteousness, many sins, and duties, and divine attributes,</HI> which are all <HI>spiri|tuall</HI> objects, and some of them some of those things of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> which the meer <HI>natural man,</HI> without the <HI>Spirits</HI> revealing, cannot know, because they are <HI>spiritually</HI> discerned, that man must be <HI>spiritually</HI> enlightned; so out of a <HI>better Bow</HI> then the <HI>Devils,</HI> even that of <HI>Iosephs,</HI> which abides in strength, I <HI>shoot</HI> back <HI>T: Ds</HI>: second <HI>Arrow</HI> again, thus against himself, as that which hath done us no harm, howbeit he meant it otherwise, it being in his mind to have mischief'd the Truth: <HI>viz. Christ enlightens every man that is (spiritually) enlightned,</HI> witness <HI>T:D: p:</HI> 36: but <HI>every individuall man</HI> is more or lesse even (<HI>spiritually</HI>) inlightned, <HI>i. e.</HI> to discern <HI>spiritual</HI> objects, which by the <HI>Spirits</HI> revealing them only, and not <HI>naturally,</HI> but <HI>spiritually</HI> only, or by the <HI>Spirit</HI> are to be discerned, witness <HI>T:D:</HI> again <HI>p:</HI> 1: therefore <HI>Christ inlightens every individuall man.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="74" REF="351">3 <HI>T: D:</HI> who hath mostly two, hath here a third <HI>string to his Bow,</HI> left the two first should not hold, from which he <HI>shoots</HI> thus, <HI>viz.

<P><HI>Repl.</HI> And this, however he meanes <HI>pinchingly,</HI> yet is true too, <HI>in terminis,</HI> that Christ enlightens <HI>some every where, a number in all Nations,</HI> as he ex|presses it over again <HI>p.</HI> 36. for the termes (<HI>all</HI>) and (<HI>every one</HI>) are <HI>conclu|sive</HI> continually of (<HI>some</HI>) but that Arrow reaches not far enough to wound our <HI>universal construction,</HI> so long as the termes (<HI>some</HI>) <HI>(a number)</HI> (<HI>many</HI>) without a (<HI>but</HI>) put to them, whereby to bolt out <HI>othersome</HI> which is wanting here (though elsewhere added and by and by to be talkt with) is not <HI>exclusive</HI> of <HI>all men,</HI> of <HI>every man,</HI> nor of <HI>any man</HI>; and so his <HI>bow</HI> and <HI>bolts shoots</HI> too short to hit the <HI>Butt</HI> still: Nor is the <HI>Phrase Rev.</HI> 5:9: which <HI>T: D</HI>: in his fancy, fellows, and Identifies with this in <HI>Iohn</HI> 1:9: like it in any wise, for one is (<HI>enlightens every man in the world</HI>) the other (<HI>Redeemed us out of every Nation,</HI> &amp;c.) were it, <HI>Redeemed every man in every Nation</HI>; and <HI>made every man in every Nation: and Kindred, &amp;c. a King, a Priest to God, &amp;c.</HI> then it had been somewhat nee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a Kin to it in|deed.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>T: D:</HI> by his <HI>single self,</HI> with all his <HI>sharpest shafts,</HI> or <HI>sorry shifts,</HI> can make nothing stick to the gaining of any ground against us, nor so much as to stirre us a hairs breadth from our interest in it, much lesse to storm us out of the <HI>strong Hold</HI> we have in that <HI>high place of Scripture,</HI> wherein the <HI>Qua.</HI> stand over the head of the <HI>Serpent,</HI> to the bruising of it: Let us see (sith <HI>vis unita fortior</HI>) what the joyned forces of him and <HI>I.

<P>That sense I shall joyn issue in against them both at last, but there lies on <HI>single sense</HI> of <HI>I: O:</HI> wherein <HI>T. D.</HI> joyns not with him, wherewith <HI>I.

<P>ANd this, that Christ died for <HI>all men,</HI> without exception, and God in him intends salvation to all, as truly willing they should have it, rather then not (if in their own obstinate wills they withstand it not by refusing to return when he draws them) as he <HI>truly tenders</HI> it to them, and hath of his own <HI>free Love and Grace</HI> impowered them, as well to <HI>receive it, if they will,</HI> as to <HI>reject it if they will,</HI> and vouchsafed them all some <HI>measure,</HI> though not the <HI>same measure</HI> of the <HI>true Light,</HI> which is <HI>sufficient</HI> to guide <HI>All</HI> that follow on to know him in it to that <HI>saving knowledge</HI> of himself, and <HI>Christ,</HI> which is <HI>Life eternal,</HI> is from the whole scope of Scripture as cer|tain (to him who is not blinded, with that Sorcerer that could not see the Sun) as 'tis that <HI>I: O:</HI> sayes (falsly) the contrary is certain from <HI>innume|rable places</HI> of it; out of which I argue, in proof of the foresaid Truths, as followeth.</P>
<P><HI>Argum.</HI> 1. If it were so certain (as these men say 'tis by their spokes|man <HI>I: O: Ex.</HI> 4. <HI>S.</HI> 13, 17.) that <HI>God doth not savingly enlighten all and every man, but some only, i.e. the Elect</HI>; that he <HI>must be blind, and void of all spiritual understanding, that dreames to the contrary, and that Christ in no wise vouchsafes saving Light to all and every man,</HI> nor any measure of that <HI>Grac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> that is <HI>sufficient</HI> to save men, let them attend to it never to well,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Vt cunque ei attenda|tur I: O:</HI> Ex. 4: <HI>S:</HI> 17.</NOTE> then he could not say truly and honestly without a lye, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Absit blasphemia,</HI> far be from us that blasphemy once to think that God lies.</NOTE> that <HI>this wayes are equall; and as he lives he had rather the wicked should turn from his wickedness, and live, then die in and for it</HI>; fith he might (in a way of con|sistency with the <HI>unchangeableness</HI> of his <HI>un|changeable Decree.</HI> concerning the death of <HI>finall Impenitents</HI>) put them, at least, into a <HI>capable|ness</HI> to <HI>chuse</HI> life, and <HI>possibility</HI> to <HI>come</HI> to it, if they would, as well as to <HI>chuse</HI> death, if they would, and thereby have shewed the <HI>equally</HI> of his wayes, in letting men have what they will, and as they do, yet would not do so much for them as that.</P>
<P>But most certain 'tis, that <HI>Gods wayes</HI> are all <HI>most equall,</HI> so as to let men have from him what they <HI>chuse (viz.) Life,</HI> and <HI>Good,</HI> and <HI>Blessing</HI> in Christ the Light, or <HI>Death,</HI> and <HI>Evil,</HI> and the <HI>Curse,</HI> in the deeds of darkness, when both are set before them, <HI>Deut.</HI> 11.26.30.19: <HI>Isai.</HI> 66: 3, 4: and as certain 'tis that God so sayes as abovesaid, and <HI>truly wishes rather that the wicked, even those that do die, should turn and live,</HI> (as else they cannot,) but that they <HI>will not</HI>; mark <HI>Ezek</HI>: 18: throughout, and <HI>Ezek</HI>: 33: <HI>v.</HI> 8: to <HI>v:</HI> 21. Yea. <HI>O</HI> (saith he) <HI>that there were such an heart in them that they would fear me,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>that it might be well with them, Deut</HI>: 5: 29: with a number more of the

like wishes, <HI>Matth:</HI> 23: 37: <HI>Luke</HI> 13: 44. <HI>Luke</HI> 19:41, 42. And whatever God sayes or wishes, he doth it truly and honestly, meaning as he sayes, and is not such an <HI>Hypocrite, Lyar,</HI> and <HI>Dissembler,</HI> as <HI>T: Ds:</HI> Doctrine, of his tendring what he never intends. doth make him.</P>
<P>Therefore he <HI>vouchsafeth</HI> to <HI>All</HI> and <HI>every man,</HI> even those that come to perish, but that they neglect it at some time or other, <HI>same measure of sa|ving Grace,</HI> and a <HI>Light sufficient</HI> to lead them to Salvation.</P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> 2: If God did not give at one time or other to all men such <HI>Grace, Liberty, Light,</HI> and <HI>Power,</HI> as is sufficient to bring them to life, if they will <HI>chuse</HI> the life, and <HI>well improve</HI> that <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Power,</HI> to the <HI>working out</HI> of their Salvation, when he bids them, by it, then God could not to all men render life by his Ministers, nor say, <HI>Work out your own salvation, chuse life, that ye may live, else my soul shall chuse your greater destruction,</HI> without <HI>mock|ing</HI> of men in in their <HI>misery,</HI> before that time wherein he sayes, he will only, &amp; may justly <HI>mock at their calamity</HI> (which is only when they have fil|led up their measure of <HI>scorning</HI> at him, <HI>set at nought all his counsel,</HI> and <HI>utterly rejected his reproof, Prov:</HI> 1:) (<HI>Si enim lumen seu gratiam salutarem suam dare omnibus Deus nolit, &amp; tamen omnes ad salutem pervenire</HI> (Sub poena) <HI>requirit; quid ni per talem gratiam millies mille miseros homunciones ludos fa|cere (absit blasphemia) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">stimandus est</HI>?) Nay, nor yet without <HI>horrible cruelty, absurdity,</HI> and <HI>non-sense</HI>: For as much as it is no lesse then <HI>non-sensicalnesse, absurdity, meer mockage,</HI> and <HI>cruelty,</HI> for a <HI>Prince</HI> to say to a condemned <HI>help|lesse Malefactor</HI> that is lock'd up in chains, ready to be led away to executi|on (without affording him <HI>sufficient help</HI> so to do, and with much threaten|ing of so much the worse torture and pain in his death, if he do it not,) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> would not at all that thou shouldst dye, chuse rather to live, shake off thy chains, run from thy Guard that leads thee, save thy self, and here is a Par|don for thee; but if thou dost not take this my counsel, thou shalt be ten|fold more severely executed: Yea, it is against the very nature of choice, to lay <HI>two things</HI> before a man, saying, chuse which of these <HI>two</HI> thou wilt, and yet leave him under a <HI>necessity</HI> of taking the worst, and put him into no possibility of taking the other, but rather lay it utterly out of his <HI>reach,</HI> so that he must needs have the worst or neither: such <HI>choice</HI> (as the Pro|verb is) is no other then <HI>Hobson's choice,</HI> which is, <HI>chuse whether thou wilt have this or none.</HI></P>
<P>But it is certain, that God speaks in such wise, as aforesaid, by his <HI>Mini|sters</HI> to <HI>men,</HI> and it cannot be denyed by your selves (unless you deny your own Doctrine) for ye usually preach so in his Name to <HI>all men</HI>; yea, could the whole World (to use <HI>T.Ds:</HI> phrase in his <HI>Ep.</HI> 2 <HI>Pamph.</HI>) be brought in the reach of your voices, ye would <HI>offer Salvation to them All,</HI> (as much as ye seem to your selves to know, that God intends it only to a <HI>Few</HI>) and would say, We (as <HI>Ambassadours from God) set life and death before you, Chuse life that ye may live,</HI> God would not have you die, <HI>Why will you die</HI>? Work out your own salvation (though ye (falsly) believe he hath wrought but in a few a <HI>sufficient Light, Grace,</HI> and <HI>Power,</HI> to <HI>will and de</HI> what ye calls them to) <HI>turn your selves, and live,</HI> here is plenteous Re|demption for you, else if ye do not, this <HI>call, warning, tender, fair proffer,</HI> shall be to you but the <HI>sorer condemnation</HI>: And yet God neither is <HI>non-sensicall,</HI>

<P>Therefore God hath undoubtedly <HI>vouchsafed a measure of his saving Grace,</HI> and <HI>Power,</HI> and a <HI>light sufficient</HI> to lead them to life, if <HI>they use well, improve, they, follow, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat Eight, Power, and Grace, to all and every man.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. If God have not <HI>sufficiently</HI> and <HI>savingly enlightned and impowred all</HI> and <HI>every man everywhere</HI> by such measure of that <HI>Grace</HI> of his, as may lead and enable them to act that Repentance which is to Life and Salvation, but some few only, <HI>i.e.</HI> the Elect (which, according to your Principles too, are scarce one of a thousand in the world) then he not only requires and commands utter impossibilities from most men, but also judges and pu|nishes them most severely, yea eternally, for the not doing of that in their own persons, which he knows they neither can, nor in their own persons ever could do; for asmuch as <HI>sub poena Iudicii,</HI> on pain of <HI>Iudgement</HI> and <HI>Condemnation</HI> at the great day of it by Christ, he, <HI>now</HI> at least, <HI>commandeth all men</HI> (saith <HI>Paul, Acts</HI> 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.30, 31.) even <HI>everywhere to repent,</HI> and yet he knows, that <HI>without him and his Grace they can do nothing, all their sufficiency to will and to do good must come from him,</HI> and that his <HI>Grace,</HI> which in the least measure of it, <HI>is sufficient for them,</HI> and that he gath given but to <HI>very few</HI> (though he requires of them, that have it not, to do what they only can do, that have it) and to give it to the <HI>most</HI> he never intends it.</P>
<P>But God does not command from most men (though sinne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s) <HI>utter impossibilities,</HI> and require of them with such rigour, as own pain of his <HI>doubling condemnation</HI> on them, the doing of that in their own persons, which he knows <HI>per se</HI> they neither <HI>can do, nor ever could</HI>; for this were utterly <HI>inconsistent</HI> with that <HI>tender Mercy, exceeding great Love, Bowels of compassion,</HI> and <HI>true good Will,</HI> which the <HI>Spirit</HI> every where declares God heares to all Mankind, even in the <HI>Fall,</HI> to the World, even in its <HI>Enmity,</HI> who proclaims <HI>Peace, Reconciliation, Good will towards Men, (An indefinite phrase aequivalent there to an universal) incomparable Love to the World,</HI> though it perishes for hating that <HI>Light</HI> that is come into them, which he sends to save them: See and mark <HI>Luke</HI> 2, 14. <HI>Iohn</HI> 3.16, <HI>&amp;c.

<P>Arg. Ye <HI>bid me believe Christ died for me, has Salvation for me, which God by you offers to me, and you call me to come to him for it, as that which, without hypocrisie or feignedness, God would have me to enjoy, being not willing I should perish: But what ground would ye have me to come upon, or of assurance I shall be welcome, or accepted in my acceptance, or of believing assuredly that God is really willing I should have it?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Its sufficient for all.</P>
<P>Arg. <HI>That's not the Question, I doubt not but there's sufficiency enough in Christ to save All to the utmost that come to God by him, but what's that to me? that's not a sufficient ground for me to believe upon; many things are sufficient for many things, &amp; to many more men then are ere the better for them</HI> (as some <HI>greedy Grandees</HI> have many thousand pounds a year, which is sufficient for an 100 honest men to live <HI>honestly</HI> upon; but he that shall go upon that account to feed and live at one of their Tables, may for all that be likely thrust out as an <HI>Intruder</HI>) but <HI>can you tell me the glad tidings that that is for me, if so, I'le believe it, and accept it, and come with all my heart, if you can lay a ground for me to be confident on, that I may, if I come, not be more bold then welcome.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> All are invited and call'd to come, and call'd freely, fully, without exception, to believe; therefore why not thou?</P>
<P>Arg. <HI>But Friends, though all be called to come and welcome to God, by you who say ye are his Ministers, Is this in sincerity and truth, or in hypocrisie and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ackage? is God as willing as ye seem to make him, that all shall come to life.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> Yea without hypocrisie, for God cannot dissemble, nor mean one thing and say another (though we say so of him sometimes, as <HI>T.D.</HI> does) he is freely willing, if thou art willing, he would not have thee die, but much rather live.</P>
<P>Arg. <HI>But how shall I know that yet for my self? does he intend the Salvation to all as really as ye pretend he does in the universal extent and proffer, or to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me only? for some of you say, he does offer it where he intends they, to whom ye say so sincerely offered, shall never have it, but are by a secret Decree of God bolted out from it for</HI> Adams <HI>sin before they were born, in the guilt of which (though he will save a few, that he may shew his Mercy, Live, Grace to All</HI> (as some sillily say) <HI>to be of more extent then all his works, which few are only known to himself, and not</HI> (as ye say) <HI>to you and me) he will</HI> praeterire, <HI>pass by, even a thousand to one, to perish unavoidably, notwithstanding Christs death, and so I may be one of those many, for ought either you or I know, yea a thousand to one but that I am proe-ordained to perish, and therefore still I have far more

<P>Arg. <HI>Does he intend it to the most?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Nay, but to very few.</P>
<P>Arg. <HI>Do ye know I am one of those few that he intended it to, or of those many to whom not?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> No not I, we are servants, we know not what the Master does, not which are the Elect, which not.</P>
<P>Arg. <HI>On what ground then bid you me believe I am one of the few, its more likely I am of the many that must perish, even by how much they are so many to one more then those are that must live?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> All that come shall have it.</P>
<P>Arg. <HI>How can that be, when yet ye say its not intended to All, which if it be true, suppose all should accept it and come (as ye say all cannot neither for want of power) they cannot have it, because not intended for them?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Yea, its offered on condition of acceptance, faith, and coming, so that could ye suppose <HI>All</HI> would take God at his word, and accept the proffer, they should have the benefit.</P>
<P>Arg. <HI>But that must not be supposed, nor cannot rationally, according to your principles, who tell us All cannot come, cannot believe nor accept, for to accept, believe, the power at least must come from God, and he hath not, say you, given that, nor saving Light, under any consideration to All, but to those few only to whom he intends the Salvation, which I still demand a ground from you whereupon to believe I am one of, which till then I cannot believe any more then groundlesly, and groundless faith is no better then vain hope, which is fancy that will fail when men come to give up the Ghost?</HI></P>

<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Nay, I cannot tell that, its hid from me; but this is all we can say, that he intends it to some really, and he offers it to all conditionally they believe, so that if thou believe it its thine.</P>
<P>Arg. <HI>I cannot believe that though you bid me, nor ought neither, which you, who bid me believe it, can give me no ground for, nor evidence of, that it is so, and confess your selves you know not whether it is so or no; that he died, I believe, as ye say, for some, and so they believe all o're</HI> Christendome, <HI>and in</HI> England, <HI>and also believe mostly</HI> every man for himself, <HI>that Christ died for him; where yet for all your saying, he that believes so hath him, there's not one of many h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th him, as your selves confess; whose faith therefore, which ye beget many to, is mostly fancy, for they have not the Salvation yet, which is from the sin, but to believe it without more evidence for it, that it is a truth, he died for me, even for me in par|ticular, then I see upon what</HI> principles <HI>ye are able to give me, were as fond as to believe a piece of news for truth, which the man who tells it, tells me, he knows it not, whether it be a truth or no, but much doubts it, or glad tidings of great joy to all people, which the News-m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nger himself can give me no evidence at all, that it belongs to me at a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l; but after his most universal publication of it, that he has tidings to all and every one, and would have every one believe it so to him|self, begins to fall back into such a diminutive prate, or pinching publik<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> privi|cation, or private publication, as, when demanded about his news in this manner, Friend, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t thou sure this thou extendest to all, is good news intended to all, is it so to me in particular, whom thou bidst believe it good news to me?</HI> Replyes in this wise; Nay, I cannot say that, I say its to all and every one, but by those terms I mean but some, and those very few; and I cannot say which nor whether in particular, thou art one of them or nay, yet thou must be|lieve it, or else sad tidings will come after it, thou shalt be hanged up for not believing its glad tidings, which said News; monger I should judge so little worth much heeding, crediting, or believing in what he sayes, that I should rather think him out of his wits, and to have suffered some shipwrack (as our Priests have done of the true Faith) of his very common sense and reason <HI>Shew me therefore what evidence ye have of the truth of the thing ye tell me, and bid me believe, or else its but as Implicit Faith (</HI> as at Rome) <HI>if I should believe it, and not because I see it likely, but because ye say so, who yet tel' me of what ye say, or bid me believe,</HI> viz. <HI>that Christ died for me, for he died for some, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Elect only; that he cannot tell at all

<P><HI>Answ.</HI> We say still it is offered to you as 'tis to all, on condition of ac|ceptance and of faith, so that who believes it shall have it, whoever he is, and 'tis believing evidences it to be so.</P>
<P>Arg. <HI>Still ye run but in a round (as the Colliers faith does) and say no more in effect then thus, first believe, and be confident, that Christ died for thee, and then this faith and belief of it, that he died for thee, is a sure good ground or evidence for thee, upon which thou mayest believe and be confident, that he did die for thee, and that thou art one of those few he died for, and not of those many to one, to all whom as freely as to thee he is offered, not one of whom yet he died for, or was by God ever intended to.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> But mind the Condition though; he is offered to all on condi|tion of acceptance, so that if thou perform the condition, as most do not, for few will come, thou must have the thing promised thereon, that is, the Salvation.</P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> The Condition! <HI>I know Christ is not only offered to all on condition, but intended also to be the Saviour of All, on that condition they reject him not, but believe in his Name, come at his Call, and obey his Voice and Counsel, which God also by his Truth, Grace, and Love, puts men into capacity to do, or not to do, at their choice.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But as for</HI> your Condition, I say, <HI>it's more monstrous then all the rest, while for all your offers to All conditionally, they believe ye say it's peremptorily intended but to few, and those few shall not chuse but perform it, and an hundred to one are as peremptorily intended by God, to be never interested in it, nor enabled to per|form the Condition ou which only its meant.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ye say indeed God offers and tenders Salvation by Christ to all conditionally, they believe in him, each man that he died for him, but what is this, so long as it's not intended to all, and there is no such matter (</HI> as ye say) <HI>to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> believed, un|lesse most men believe a lye, as that Christ died for</HI> All, <HI>and</HI> every man? <HI>For a man to tell an hundred condemned men, there is life offered to them all, on condi|tion they every man of them believe it is so as he sayes, and to bid them believe it as the Truth, for want of believing of which only they shall be executed more cruelly, in believing of which they shall be saved; and then to tell them, the said Pardon is really, positively, and peremptorily intended but to one of them only, and not one of all the rest assuredly shall ever have it, its absolutely, unalterably de|creed, that the ninety and nine shall be hanged, is to destroy all the ground of the belief ye would beget them to, and to carry an hundred men up on high into a Steeple, in vain, aiery hopes of some glorious sight pretended to be shewed to them all, that from thence advantage may be taken, as the thing intended, for all the fair pretence, to throw ninety and nine of them down, go the breaking of their necks, and the mischieving of them more, then if they had never been so fairly premised, and so highly elevated, and but one of them be shewed the Light, which to all was promised; for the absolute Decree and intent of God must ever inavoidably stand and take place against the conditional proffer of that which in the Decree is not intended; so the proffer on condition still is not worth a straw, nor any thing, but a meer mockage of men, and such a one as is before that time wherein God sayes he will mock and laugh at men, which is only when they have finally rejected what once they truly might have had, and was indeed as truly in|tended

Is not this offer upon as <HI>unequal termes,</HI> as if a man should tender to two <HI>condemned prisoners bound up in chains,</HI> that they shall both live, if they will come out of <HI>prison,</HI> but if not, they shall be more cruelly executed for refusal, <HI>intending</HI> to <HI>unlock</HI> one of them, that he may come forth, and to light, lead, and compel him <HI>irresistably</HI> to come forth also, that he may have the benefit of the <HI>Pardon,</HI> and live; and as ab|solutely intending to leave the other lock'd under restraint in his chains, utterly devoid of any <HI>liberty</HI> to come forth, to the end that he may cut him off from any benefit of the promised Pardon, and take <HI>double vengeance on him</HI> for <HI>non-acceptance</HI> thereof? and are these <HI>equal Termes?</HI> are these wayes so equal as God sayes his wayes are? <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18. who <HI>absolutely</HI> wills not the death of any that are as <HI>willing</HI> to live as he would have them, and that do not <HI>wilfully</HI> die for want of <HI>turning from those iniquities in which they cannot live,</HI> and from which he <HI>impowers them to turn,</HI> but that they refuse it, as well as leaves them to <HI>chuse death</HI> too, if they will neees have it?

<P>But the <HI>Light of Christ</HI> in each <HI>Conscience</HI> is so, teaching there whatever, God requires of each person, as to his own <HI>peace,</HI> and what God in the doing thereof will accept him in, and the <HI>Letter not so</HI>; therefore the said <HI>Light, and not the Letter,</HI> is that by which <HI>Christ is Gods Witness to the world,</HI> and All <HI>peoples Leader</HI> (if they will follow him) unto life.</P>
<P>The <HI>Plaster</HI> should be <HI>adequate</HI> to the <HI>sore,</HI> and not <HI>short of it</HI> (as the <HI>Light</HI> is not, but the <HI>Letter</HI> is in its extent, in respect to all <HI>ends of the earth</HI>) else there's as much <HI>folly</HI> in this extreme, as I said above, there would be in the other (it being as little wisdome to be <HI>too short,</HI> as to <HI>over-reach</HI>) for a man to make a <HI>Plaster</HI> no broader then a <HI>penny,</HI> for a <HI>wound</HI> as <HI>broad</HI> as a <HI>Crown piece,</HI> as 'tis to cut a <HI>Plaster</HI> of the compass of a <HI>bushel,</HI> for a <HI>sore</HI> no <HI>broader,</HI> then a <HI>six pence.</HI></P>

wants not sufficiency in it to save, and that men are not saved, but most|ly condemned by it, 'tis only because they answer not the Mind of God revealed in it, but love the <HI>darkness</HI> more then it, which they <HI>hate to come to</HI> (as Christ saves) <HI>because their deeds are evill</HI>: whereas did they but glorifie him answerably to what he requires of them, who no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>ex|acts</HI> nor <HI>expects</HI> from any the doing more of his <HI>Mind and Will,</HI> then what he one time or other manifesteth to them to be his Will concerning them in their own consciences, they should <HI>not be without excuse,</HI> nor stand <HI>con|demned in Gods sight,</HI> but be <HI>accepted, justified,</HI> and <HI>saved</HI> from the <HI>wrath</HI> which comes only on the <HI>Children of disobedience,</HI> it being the <HI>Power of God</HI> as sufficient to the excuse and Salvation of those from <HI>sin</HI> and <HI>wrath</HI> that <HI>obey</HI> the <HI>measure of it</HI> in themselves, as to subject those to <HI>accusation, re|jection, judgement, wrath</HI> and <HI>condemnation,</HI> that rebel against it.</P>

<P>But every man <HI>needs light from Christ, and there is necessity (in respect that</HI> every man (<HI>else</HI>) <HI>is blinded by him to his destruction,</HI> as well as <HI>some men) of Christs enlightning with his true and saving light,</HI> every man <HI>as well as</HI> some men only; This we need not prove, sith <HI>R.

<P>Therefore undoubtedly, <HI>more</HI> or <HI>lesse,</HI> Christ hath with <HI>true saving light</HI> enlightned <HI>every man,</HI> and not some <HI>few men only.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<P>I Shall now betake my self to take some brief view of <HI>R.Bs.</HI> and <HI>I.Ts. trivial talk,</HI> and to <HI>consider some of their inconsiderable arguings,</HI> and <HI>confu|sed oppositions to the contrary,</HI> at least so many as whereby men may judge probably of what sort the rest are, who in <HI>disproof of the saving sufficien|cy</HI> of the <HI>Light</HI> in every man (which they call sometimes the Light that comes from God, sometimes every mans own light) to lead him unto God, have mustered up together no less then thirty or forty <HI>Arguments</HI> and <HI>Reasons,</HI> as they call them, not one of all which hath so much <HI>weight</HI> in it, as can truly render it <HI>worthy</HI> of the name of a <HI>Reason</HI> in that case its brought for: They lie all together in one <HI>Litter,</HI> between page 42. and 54. making up the whole sixth of those nine dark <HI>Sermons,</HI> and no small part of the seventh, not more <HI>seemingly</HI> for, then <HI>shamefully a|gainst the true Light</HI> there said <HI>to enlighten every man that comes into the world,</HI> prated out from <HI>Iohn</HI> 1.9. by <HI>I. Tom.</HI> and back't by <HI>R. Baxter.</HI></P>
<P>Their thirty <HI>Arguments,</HI> to which they add <HI>ten Reasons</HI> of their own, they say, are out of Scripture, and so I confess they are <HI>in one sense,</HI> there being not one at all of them to be found either <HI>in,</HI> or so much as truly deduced from the <HI>Scripture.</HI></P>
<P>The Scriptures the first Argument is (<HI>far</HI>) fetch't from, are <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. 11. <HI>None understands, none seeks after God,</HI> 1 Cor. 2.14. <HI>The natural man dis|cerns not the things of the Spirit, &amp;c.</HI> Gen. 6.5. and 8.21. <HI>Every imagina|tion of mans heart is only evil, &amp;c.</HI> Jer. 10.14. <HI>Every man is bruitish in his knowledge,</HI> Jer. 17.9. <HI>The heart is deceitful above all things</HI>; whence they argue thus, <HI>Their Light, of whom these things are said, is not a safe rule to guide them into the pleasing of God, but these things are said of All,</HI> or some men; <HI>therefore every mans Light in him, is not a safe Guide to God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rep.</HI> We confess these things are said not of <HI>some only,</HI> but of <HI>All men,</HI> as they are in the fall, who are <HI>All gone out of the way:</HI> But what of that? Are <HI>All men</HI> therefore, because gone out <HI>without any measure of Light sufficient to guide into the way</HI> again? in that <HI>Ali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nation</HI> none seeks God; Are <HI>All</HI> then without any of that <HI>true Light,</HI> wherein God is to be found of such as will seek him in it? <HI>All natural men</HI> (such as <HI>All</HI> are, till they turn to be led by the <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI>) by their meer <HI>animal wisdome,</HI> see not <HI>spiritual things</HI>: Are <HI>All</HI> therefore without the <HI>least measure</HI> of <HI>that Spirit and spiritual Light</HI>; that shews them, viz. <HI>the Law of God</HI> in their minds, which is <HI>spiritual,</HI> lusting in them against the <HI>flesh,</HI> though they are <HI>carnal? every mans</HI> imagination and thoughts are evil, <HI>every man</HI> is b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">itish in his own knowledge, <HI>every mans heart,</HI> as he is gone out from the truth told by God within himself, after the <HI>Devil</HI> that abode not in it, is there therefore <HI>true Light</HI> in no man that manifests the deceits of his
<PB N="154" REF="389">
heart in <HI>some wise</HI> to him? Is that <HI>truth</HI> in <HI>no man</HI> which he is to abide in, and which if he <HI>abide in it,</HI> it will teach him the Will of God? I say, is <HI>no measure</HI> of this in <HI>no men</HI>? For this <HI>Argument</HI> of these men, could it conclude any man to be without the said <HI>sufficient Light</HI> (as it does not, there being no consequence in it) would <HI>consequently</HI> conclude <HI>every man</HI> to be without it, as he is in the fall, and come out into the world, and then instead of reading that Text, <HI>viz. Iohn</HI> 1.9. that <HI>I. Tombs talks from,</HI> and <HI>R. B. repeats his Sermons on thus</HI>; That <HI>was the true Light that enlightens</HI> every man <HI>that comes into the world,</HI> as 'tis in the Bible; or thus, <HI>That was the true Light that enlighteneth the</HI> Elect, or some few men, or some of all sorts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as <HI>I. O. T. D. R. B. I. T.</HI> interpret it besides the <HI>literal sense</HI> and <HI>proper import</HI> of the term <HI>every man,</HI> we must henceforth read thus&punc; viz. <HI>The true Light that enlighteneth</HI> no man <HI>that comes into the world,</HI> every man being bruitish, every mans heart (till he comes to the Light that's come to him) being deceitful as well as any mans; and so the <HI>saving, Grace and Light</HI> shall no more be coop't up in a corner among <HI>a few,</HI> but be allowed no place in the world of <HI>any mans heart</HI> at All; but who will say thus (as they say in effect) but such as are become <HI>bruitish,</HI> and <HI>besotted</HI> with them?</P>
<P>And if they tell us they speak and mean not of <HI>Gods Light</HI> here, but of <HI>mans own Light,</HI> as no good <HI>guide to God,</HI> what do they <HI>band</HI> against the <HI>Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">akers</HI> for then, and <HI>bend</HI> the <HI>force</HI> of their <HI>frivolous Argument</HI> against them? who look upon <HI>every mans own light, and thoughts,</HI> and <HI>imagination</HI> of his heart, <HI>wisdome, knowledge,</HI> and <HI>understanding,</HI> which he is gone out into, from <HI>Gods Light,</HI> to be <HI>natural,</HI> and <HI>weak,</HI> and <HI>foolishness,</HI> and <HI>dark|ness,</HI> as much and more then themselves (who are yet found in no o|ther) for whatever they mean when they <HI>prate against the Light</HI> the <HI>Qua.</HI> testifie to, calling it natural, mans own, and blindne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and darkness, which <HI>Andabato um more,</HI> they confusedly fight against in their dark minds, under the <HI>terms</HI> sometimes of the <HI>true Light</HI> Christ bids men be|lieve in, that they may be the children of it, which is no other then the <HI>Gospel Light of God and Christ himself,</HI> sometimes of every mans <HI>own Light,</HI> mans own thoughts, imaginations, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Merae tenebrae &amp; ce|citas,</HI> quoth <HI>I.

<P>Thus far as to <HI>R.B.</HI> and <HI>I.Ts.</HI> first Argument, by which men may judge of the constitution of the rest, which are all of the same complexion.</P>
<P>The second is drawn from <HI>Act.</HI> 17.22.23. <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.21.22.23. the sum of which in short is this; <HI>The most improved Gentiles</HI> (for all that <HI>Light</HI> which was in them) <HI>were in all things too superstitious, were carried about to dumb Idols as they were led, had their foolish hearts darkned about their thoughts of God, worshipped</HI> him ignorantly, and such like; therefore <HI>they, much less the most barbarous, and consequently none of the Gentiles, who had not the Scri|pture,</HI> nor such other teaching as Gods people were taught by, <HI>had not a Light in them that was sufficient without the Scripture to guide them to God, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rep.</HI> That the <HI>Gentiles</HI> were generally <HI>superstitious, fool<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sh, dark, blind, idolatrous, and ignorant</HI> in their <HI>worshippings of God,</HI> I deny not; howbeit, <HI>I close not cordially</HI> with that <HI>clause</HI> (the <HI>most improved</HI>) in the <HI>Antecedent,</HI> for 'twas through <HI>non-improvement</HI> of the <HI>Light</HI> they had; and because at the best they were <HI>ill improved</HI> in it, that they became so, for had they heeded the <HI>Light,</HI> they had been led out of <HI>Idols,</HI> to the <HI>knowledge of God</HI> by it, for what is to <HI>be known of God, is by it manifest in them, Rom.</HI> 1.19. But what if the best <HI>improved Gentiles</HI> were so as ye say, vain in their thoughts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they might have better improved the Light then they did, and the <HI>Reason</HI> why they were so <HI>fortishly superstitious</HI> was, not because they had not <HI>sufficient Light to lead them</HI> in the <HI>true knowledge of God and his Worship,</HI> and direct them to discern the <HI>truth,</HI> but because they look't not to the <HI>Light,</HI> because they went out from the <HI>Light</HI> they had, by which they had some measure of the <HI>knowledge of God,</HI> into their <HI>own wisdome,</HI> leaning to their <HI>own understanding,</HI> and so became vain; therefore is it said, <HI>They were without excuse, because when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkned, and professing them|selves to be wise, they became fools, and changed the glory of God into an Image, and changed the truth of God into a lye, and worshipped and served the crea|ture more then the Creator, not liking to retain him (and that true worship of him, which the Light would have led them to) in their knowledge,</HI> and the Gentiles there were not so vain and foolish, ignorant of God, and su|perstitious for want of Light to <HI>guide them,</HI> as <HI>R. B. T. D.</HI> dote they were, <HI>to Gods true worship,</HI> but for want of <HI>being guided</HI> by the <HI>Light</HI> they had: So what's this to <HI>their purpose</HI>? Who sees not the <HI>blindness, weakness, folly, nakedness,</HI> and <HI>falsity</HI> of this argument? one <HI>absurdity</HI> in which also more notable in it then the rest is this, <HI>viz.</HI> that in the conclusion, is inferred <HI>aliud a negaro,</HI> another thing then that which is denied by the <HI>Qua.</HI> and undertaken to be proved against them by themselves; for <HI>therefore,</HI> say
<PB N="156" REF="390">
they, <HI>the Gentiles who had not the Scripture,</HI> nor such other teaching as Gods people are taught by, <HI>had not a Light sufficient, &amp;c.</HI> the words in which conclusion are true, though <HI>nihil ad Rhombum,</HI> if there be any such Gentiles that have neither Scripture, nor such other teaching (Mark that phrase foisted in by them, whereby they conclude another matter then is denied by us in the Question in hand; for the <HI>Gentiles</HI> that have not the <HI>other teaching,</HI> i. e. <HI>that of the Light within,</HI> have not the Light within that's true, who doubts it, but none such are to be found that have not that Light and Grace in some measure by which God teaches his and <HI>Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> people,</HI> though most <HI>Gentiles</HI> are found <HI>destitute</HI> of an <HI>outward Letter</HI>) <HI>as God teaches his People by,</HI> which other teaching is that of the <HI>Light within,</HI> which is that other, yea, that <HI>chief teaching God teaches</HI> his and <HI>All people</HI> by, whether they learn by it yea or nay, I shall say more to them when I see them, but at present I know none such, nor ever have done.</P>
<P>Before I pass to the third Argument of <HI>R. B. I. T.</HI> from this second, I shall consider their tenth and thirteenth Arguments, which are <HI>co-inci|den,</HI> and in effect the <HI>same</HI> with this second, by which three <HI>Arguments</HI> (which yet in substance are but one) <HI>I. O.</HI> and <HI>T.

<P>As for <HI>R. B.</HI> and <HI>I.

<P>Hereupon it hath more then one, or two, or three places in their book, viz. not only in the 43 page forecited; but also page 28. and page 29. where they conclude, that because men <HI>stumble,</HI> and their <HI>imaginations are evil, their hearts deceitful and wicked, therefore they want light to direct them, and to rectifie their thoughts; if men stumble and fall, its an Argument</HI> (say they) <HI>they want Light, of such corruption want of Light to guide us in the way to happiness</HI> (oh gross) <HI>is a chief part: Ieremies</HI> sayings, <HI>Every man is bruit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sh, &amp;c. the heart is deceitful, &amp;c. do express such a destitution of Light, Truth, &amp;c.</HI> Also page 40. and 47. where their tenth and thirteenth Argu|ments (which are one, and wrested from sundry Texts, <HI>viz.

God a Lym; to give us an infallible assurance, that in receiving this testimony, we are not imposed upon by cunningly devised fables,</HI> the Light (the Scriptures; quoth <HI>I.

<P>Thus having at large answered the main argument of these four men against the universality of a <HI>sufficient Light in All men,</HI> to lead to life such as follow it, drawn from <HI>All mens nor actually</HI> coming to life by it, which one <HI>R.

So then Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God</HI>; which (say they) were vain speeches, if there were <HI>another ordinary way by the Light within us to beget Faith</HI>; therefore <HI>the Light within us is not of it self, without Preaching, a safe sufficient Guide in our way to God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rep. True Faith</HI> is in the <HI>Light of Christ,</HI> and in the <HI>Word of God,</HI> which is that <HI>word of Faith</HI> which the <HI>Apostles preached,</HI> and testified of in their <HI>words</HI> and <HI>writings,</HI> that it was <HI>nigh to men, even in their hearts, that there they might both hear and do it, Rom.</HI> 10.1. neither doth any man either <HI>hear</HI> or <HI>believe</HI> in <HI>Christ</HI> to <HI>Salvation,</HI> any further, then as he <HI>heeds, hears, and believes in that Light and ingrafted Word</HI> whereby Christ counsels him in his own conscience, although he should (as the <HI>unbelieving Iews</HI> did) hear him speaking to them with <HI>Audible Voice,</HI> or believe (as all <HI>unbe|lieving Christians</HI> do) the whole History of him according to the flesh: So then <HI>Faith unto life</HI> coming by <HI>hearing,</HI> and <HI>hearing unto life</HI> being of that <HI>Light and Word of God,</HI> which is <HI>nigh in the heart,</HI> which is the <HI>Word of both Faith and Life,</HI> the <HI>Apostles Speeches were in vain,</HI> if there were not such a <HI>Light and Word within</HI> to be believed in, to the <HI>hearing</HI> and <HI>be|lieving</HI> in which the <HI>Apostles</HI> were sent to turn men, mens obeying of which <HI>Word within,</HI> was the end of their using those words they spake and wrote to them in from without. Moreover, we deny not <HI>Preaching without</HI> by such as are sent, as <HI>Paul</HI> was (but <HI>Parish-Hirelings</HI> are not) to turn men to the <HI>Light within</HI>; but the <HI>Light within</HI> only, is that which
<PB N="168" REF="396">
<HI>guides</HI> and <HI>leads</HI> those, that are turned to it, and continue attending to it, <HI>sufficiently</HI> and <HI>safely</HI> unto God.</P>
<P>Their eighth is to this purpose; <HI>All that have access to God, must not be conformed to this world, but be transformed, renewed, put off the old man,</HI> Rom. 12.2. Eph. 4.23. Col. 3.10. <HI>Therefore they have not a Light within them, as a safe sufficient guide to lead them to God Antecedent to this renewing, for if they had, what need</HI> (say they) <HI>such transforming, renewing, non-conformity to the world, putting off the old man.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rep.</HI> Therefore they need such <HI>renewing, transforming, putting off the old man, non-conforming to this world,</HI> because that is the good will of God concerning them, and also millions of men, who have the <HI>Light in them,</HI> that condemns and reproves them for their <HI>Rebellion</HI> against it, are not conformable thereunto; and therefore they both have and need such a <HI>Light within them, Antecedent</HI> to that renewing; and need also to be called upon to turn unto it, that they may thereby see how conformable they are to this <HI>evil world,</HI> and <HI>non-conformable to that Will of God,</HI> that they may thereby first know the <HI>good Will of God,</HI> which is manifested in that <HI>Light</HI>; and secondly, by obeying <HI>that Light,</HI> be <HI>conformed to that Will,</HI> and no more unto the world, but <HI>transformed</HI> by the <HI>renewing</HI> of their minds: So that whereas they conclude all men ought to be renewed after Gods Image, &amp;c. therefore All have it not; I contrariwise conclude, <HI>All</HI> ought to be <HI>renewed</HI> according thereunto, &amp;c. therefore <HI>All</HI> have a <HI>light sufficient</HI> to lead them, as th&eacute;y follow it, into the <HI>Image of God.</HI></P>
<P>Their ninth is a <HI>sottish</HI> shameful Tergiversation, <HI>a Re substrats,</HI> from the Question, into another <HI>matter,</HI> as clear contrary to the subject in hand, as light and darkness are to each other; yea, instead of persevering to prosecute the proof of their Proposition, concerning the <HI>non-sufficiency of the Light in All men,</HI> they fall a proving the <HI>insufficiency of the darkness in All men, to be a sufficient rule to life, and safe guide of men unto God</HI>; at the end of which they entail a most abominable lye against the <HI>Quakers,</HI> say|ing, <HI>The</HI> Qua. <HI>prescribe that unto men as their Rule, which God counts their Curse</HI>; and what's that? <HI>Scilicet,</HI> the thing that of <HI>All things</HI> the <HI>Quak.</HI> of <HI>all men,</HI> who <HI>call men</HI> to <HI>Gods Light within,</HI> do <HI>call men out of</HI>; viz. the <HI>counsels, imaginations,</HI> and <HI>lusts of their own hearts,</HI> which men (say the <HI>Qua.</HI>) walking in, and b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ides the Light of God, and hearkening to, and not to the <HI>Voice of God</HI> (which <HI>I.

<P><HI>To leave a person to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s own imagination, lust, to walk in his own counsel, in his own way, which is all one as to leave him to the Light within him, is reckoned as the greatest Curse and Iudgement to a man from God, for refusing to hearken to Gods Voice, as the Text shews,</HI> Psa. 81.11.12. <HI>Therefore the Light within each person, is of it self no safe guide.</HI></P>

<P>Their eleventh argument from Jude 19. <HI>Having not the Spirit,</HI> John 14.17. <HI>The Spirit of Truth, whom the world cannot receive,</HI> is this, <HI>Every man hath not the Spirit of God; therefore every man hath not a light within sufficient to guide him to God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rep. Every man</HI> that hath not so long resisted, grieved, quenched the motions of the Spirit of God striving in him, that it thereupon is taken from him, as it was from those sensual ones <HI>Iude</HI> speaks of, whom God had given over to their lusts, hath the Spirit striving <HI>within him,</HI> and that's enough to our purpose, who own such a state, that some may be given over to, for not using what they had, while they had it, as where|in to have wisdome (at whose reproof they would not turn) withdraw and leave them to the way of folly, and the <HI>good Spirit</HI> depart from them (as he did from <HI>Saul, Iudas,</HI> the <HI>Iews,</HI> and others) and leave the house, even their hearts wholly desolate and destitute of his presence, for the <HI>evil spirit,</HI> that lusteth in men to envy, to enter and totally to possess them, and the <HI>talent,</HI> or measure of Gods <HI>Light within</HI> (sith they would not trade with it) taken away from them, that the <HI>outwa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d darkness</HI> might come upon them, and the <HI>grace of God that brought Salvation to them</HI> (which at some time or other appears to all men, <HI>Tit.</HI> 2.11.12.) sith they would not learn of it to to deny ungodliness, <HI>but turned it into wantonness, and re|ceived it in vain, despising the riches of it when it would have led them to repen|tance,</HI> leave them to the <HI>impenitency and hardness of their hearts,</HI> that they might fill up their measure of sin, and so wrath come upon them to the utmost; but all this proves not, but that once they had it, or else Christ would not have said to such as yet walk't not in it, <HI>Walk in the light while ye have it, least darkness come upon you, and ye know not whither ye go</HI>; nor could your selves say <HI>rationally</HI> (as ye do to wicked men often) O people! now while his good Spirit moves in your spirits, resist not, quench not his motions, left (like them that lay at the <HI>Pool of Bethesda,</HI> not stepping in while the Angel moved on the waters) you be left un|healed forever: Work whilst its <HI>day,</HI> left the <HI>night</HI> come on you, wherein none can work, his spirit will not strive alwayes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>As for the worlds not <HI>receiving the Spirit,</HI> so as to <HI>walk in it,</HI> it proves not that God gives it not any more, then that they have <HI>no grace given</HI> them of God, because they <HI>receive it in vain</HI>; and ye may as well say un|reasonable men have no <HI>principle of reason</HI> left in them, because they live not by it, as that they have not a <HI>sufficient light</HI> in them to lead them, be|cause they do not walk in it: Besides, it is expressly said of Christ, that by
<PB N="171" REF="397">
the same Spirit by which himself was <HI>quickned,</HI> he went and <HI>preached to the spirits in prison, i. e.</HI> to their own lusts, which were disobedient in the old world, in the dayes of <HI>Noah,</HI> which was not by his Ministry without only, as the dream, but within also in their own hearts.</P>
<P>Their twelfth runs thus; <HI>The Son did not reveal the Father to every man, nor did every man come to Christ; therefore every man had not a light within him sufficient to guide him to God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rep.</HI> The <HI>consequence</HI> of this is <HI>utterly false,</HI> for though the world <HI>hates Christ the Light,</HI> and <HI>comes not to him,</HI> yet he is come a <HI>light into the world</HI>; this he, that's not <HI>willingly ignorant</HI> of it, can scarcely chuse but see, if he read <HI>Iohn</HI> 3.16.17.18.19.20.21. it follows not because men come not <HI>into Christs Light,</HI> that therefore it is not come <HI>into them,</HI> it be|ing (as is shewed above) one thing for the <HI>Light</HI> to be in men, another for them to be <HI>in it. I am come that they might have life</HI> (faith Christ of the Jews) John 10. <HI>yet ye search the Scriptures, and therein look for Eternal life, but will not come to me that ye may have life</HI> (faith he to the Scribes, <HI>Iohn</HI> 5.) both these comings of each to other are necessary to the life, else though the Light that is able to <HI>lead to it be in men,</HI> they, not being led by it, cannot have it. Moreover, Christ does by his <HI>Light</HI> reveal the Father to such as <HI>hate both him</HI> and his Father, though they like not to know him thereby, else he could not say <HI>truly</HI> (as he does) to such, <HI>Iob.</HI> 22.23.24. <HI>If I had not come and spoken to them, they had not had sin, but now they have no cloak for their sin; If I had not done in them the works which none other doth, they had not had sin, but now they have both seen and hated, both me and my Father:</HI> In what measure men see the <HI>mind and will of Christ and his Father</HI> manife|sted in them by <HI>the Light within, Rom.</HI> 1.19. and hate that, they see and hate both <HI>Christ</HI> and his <HI>Father,</HI> whose Light, and Mind, and Will that is which appears to them.</P>
<P>Their fourteenth is urged by them from Texts of Scripture, every of which most clearly prove, or rather positively asserts the very thing they contend against; viz. <HI>that Christ is come a Light to them that sit in darkness, and so all men do, a Light to the Nations, a light into the world, that whosoever</HI> (that is in the world he is come into) <HI>believeth in him, should not perish, nor walk, nor abide in darkness, but have the light of life, Iohn</HI> 3.19.8.12. 9.5.12.46. for not coming to which, nor believing in which, not loving but hating of which, not living by which only, the world comes to be condemned: Were ever men so blinded? But (say they) Christs coming a Light into the World would be needless, if <HI>every man</HI> had a light in him before Christs coming into the World, sufficient to guide him in the way to God: Therefore the <HI>Quakers</HI> Opinion about the light in each person is a manifest errour.</P>
<P><HI>Rep.</HI> Your apprehension of the <HI>Qua.</HI> Opinion, is either a <HI>manifest er|rour,</HI> or a <HI>wilful piece of ignorance,</HI> or a <HI>miserable mistake,</HI> or something, for they hold no such thing as <HI>a light in each man sufficient to guide him without,</HI> or <HI>besides that of Christ,</HI> or <HI>before Christs coming into the world,</HI> but that the <HI>whole world lying in wickedness, and sitting in darkness,</HI> Christ is sent a <HI>Light to enlighten them,</HI> who without him are lost, and that he who is that <HI>true Light</HI> doth more or less, by his coming into the world, <HI>enlighten every man that comes into it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="398">The fifteenth concludes a lye against the <HI>Qua.</HI> as denying the use of, and dehorting from <HI>searching the Scriptures,</HI> which while Christ, <HI>Iohn</HI> 5.39. bids <HI>search</HI>; and <HI>Paul,</HI> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.15.16.17. sayes are <HI>useful</HI> and <HI>profitable</HI>; the <HI>Qua.</HI> say <HI>no</HI> (say they) <HI>but look to the light within you.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rep.</HI> I say, though the <HI>Qua.</HI> say, <HI>look to the light within</HI> (as Christ and <HI>Paul</HI> did) yet they no more deny the <HI>usefulness of the Scripture,</HI> then either of those Scriptures ye quote proves <HI>that absolute necessity of the Scripture as to Salvation,</HI> which ye seem to plead, though <HI>Christ</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> never did so; nor do we any more <HI>dehort from searching the Scripture,</HI> then Christ, <HI>Iohn</HI> 5.39. <HI>exhorteth to search them,</HI> which is not at all in <HI>that Text</HI>; for how|beit <HI>Ereunate, search,</HI> may be rendred either Indicatively, or Imperative|ly, as to its own <HI>signification</HI> (as I elsewhere shew) its most evident that he speaks there by way of <HI>complaint of the Scribes,</HI> for looking for <HI>life in the Scriptures, without coming to him who is the Light,</HI> ver. 40. and not by way of <HI>command to search them, ye search, not search ye.</HI></P>
<P>Their sixteenth is from <HI>Isa.</HI> 8.20. <HI>Psa.</HI> 119.105. To the Law, and to the Testimony; <HI>if they speak not according to this Word, there is no light in them: Thy Word is a light to my feet, a lamp to my path</HI>; whence they sillily argue, or rather blindly assert the <HI>Qua.

<P><HI>Rep.</HI> The Antecedent here is most false; for the <HI>Law, Testimony,</HI> and <HI>Word</HI> there spoken of, which is a <HI>Lamp and Light to the feet and path,</HI> and <HI>according which who speaks not,</HI> it is because the <HI>morning</HI> is not yet <HI>to him</HI> (for the word is <GAP DESC="foreign">, through the mistranslation of which phrase thus, <HI>there's no light in him,</HI> many (not knowing the <HI>Hebrew</HI>) and many that know it (not heeding it) make no small ado against the <HI>Lights being in All men</HI> (as <HI>Vavasor Powell</HI> did once at <HI>Eltham</HI>) is no other then <HI>that Light within,</HI> even that word which <HI>David</HI> had, and hid <HI>within him, that he might not sin against God, by which young men taking heed thereunto, may come to cleanse their way, Psa.</HI> 119.9. that <HI>Word of Faith that is nigh in the heart,</HI> which the <HI>Apostles preached or witnessed</HI> to, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10. <HI>that Law</HI> and <HI>Commandment,</HI> which is said to be a <HI>Lamp</HI> and <HI>Light, Prov.</HI> 6. that <HI>inward testimony of Iesus, or Spirit of Prophesie,</HI> which we, with all the Prophees of old, <HI>by words and Scriptures,</HI> bear our <HI>outward testimony</HI> unto, call'd by <HI>Peter,</HI> 2 Pet. 1.19. <HI>the more sure word of Prophesie, to which men do well to give heed, as unto a light shining in the dark place of their heart, till the day dawn, and the day star arise therein.</HI></P>
<P>This I say, and not the <HI>external Text</HI> (as ye all triflingly talk) is that <HI>Law,</HI> and <HI>Testimony,</HI> and <HI>Word,</HI> there spoken of, even the <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Testimony</HI> that comes, and is written, and is given and received immediately from and out of God and Christ's own <HI>Light, Voice,</HI> and mouth, in the <HI>hearts, minds,</HI> and <HI>consciences</HI> of all people, which his own people only give ear and hearken to, even the <HI>Rod,</HI> the <HI>Spirit,</HI> the <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Sword of his mouth,</HI> which <HI>Priests</HI> and all people are summoned to seek to, to stand <HI>in as Gods own Counsel, and to take counsel at, and be cover'd with,</HI> and <HI>take heed to their way by, that they may not sin against the Lord,</HI> and which all the wicked

<P>This is that <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>living Word,</HI> and <HI>true testimony,</HI> even the <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Word of God</HI> in the heart, a testimony that's said to be bound up from the outward <HI>Israel,</HI> which may have the outward Bible bound among them; a Law that's said to be sealed up among Christs Disciples from the sight of the be-nighted Seers, which such as seek to, seek to the Lord himself; and such as forsake, go from the <HI>Fountain</HI> of the <HI>living water, to broken Ci|steers</HI>; and such as leave for an <HI>outward letter,</HI> leave the <HI>living</HI> for the <HI>dead,</HI> and <HI>seek for the living Lord among the dead</HI>: These are the <HI>Wells of Salva|tion,</HI> out of which Souls should draw the <HI>living Water,</HI> which the <HI>Phili|stines</HI> in envy to the <HI>Seed of Abraham,</HI> will strive alway to slop, <HI>till the Lord make room for them to flow out to the full.</HI></P>
<P>These are that Word, Law, and Testimony, and not the most <HI>Original Copies of the Letter,</HI> as <HI>I.O.</HI> and ye all with him do emptily imagine, page 216. which who so deprives of the <HI>Hebrew Punctation,</HI> by proving the <HI>novelty</HI> thereof, do with <HI>Abimelechs servants,</HI> no less then utterly <HI>stop the Wells or Fountains from whence ye should draw all your Souls refreshment.</HI></P>
<P>These (as I have shewed so abundantly above, at the end of my third <HI>Exercitation,</HI> in answer to <HI>I.O.</HI> that I shall need say no more here in proof thereof) are the matters meant by the said <HI>Law and Testimony, Isa.</HI> 8.20. which are not <HI>contrary to the writing without neither,</HI> and the <HI>true out|ward Ministry and Ordinances,</HI> but <HI>consonant</HI> thereunto, which <HI>inward Law, Word,</HI> and <HI>Testimony</HI> your selves being <HI>contrary to, and opposing,</HI> are therein <HI>contrary to Gods Word,</HI> and the <HI>outward Scripture</HI> of it also; therefore not the <HI>Qua.</HI> who own all these, but your own <HI>Opinion is erroneous, and your speech is without light.</HI></P>
<P>The seventeenth from <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.11. runs thus: <HI>The Opinion and practise of the</HI> Qua. <HI>makes every man a Teacher, and Teachers set by God for the work of the Ministry needless, as if th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y were no gift, but a burden to the Church, cryes them down; therefore its contrary to Gods and Christs way, and so Antichri|stian.</HI></P>

<P>The nineteenth is urged from <HI>Psa.</HI> 19.12. <HI>Who can understand his errors?</HI> In brief to this effect, <HI>No men understand their errors; therefore each mans Light in him is not a sufficient and safe rule, and guide to him, in his way to God.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="399"><HI>Rep.</HI> If the falmists <HI>Interrogation affirmative</HI> concludes <HI>negatively,</HI> and <HI>ex|clusively</HI> of any mens having any sufficient Light, then it concludes uni|versally also against <HI>All mens</HI> having any such light, and so upon this ac|count the Saints themselves are excluded, as having no such Light, as well as other men, sith (according to <HI>R.

<P><HI>Rep.</HI> This is nought but another <HI>impudent lye against the</HI> Quakers, as well as a most <HI>evidently foolish extravagancy</HI> from the <HI>Question,</HI> which is not a|bout <HI>our own supposed Light,</HI> but some measure of <HI>that undoubted Light of God,</HI> (which (though <HI>ignorantly</HI> by you stiled <HI>natural</HI>) yet is not denied to be <HI>true Light,</HI> and <HI>that from God,</HI> and not <HI>our own, supposed</HI> only so to be.

<P>The 23. which is from the first of the two last Texts, and the 24th, which is from <HI>Pro.</HI> 14.12. are both also besides the business, and urg'd <HI>in disproof of that sufficiency of supposed light,</HI> and the way that seems right only in mans eyes, and is not so; this we have nothing to do with,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>For it is impossible but that what shows drun|kenness to be evil, must needs shew sobriety to be good.</HI></NOTE> but deny it against the <HI>Priests,</HI> who unawares to themselves, are walking therein, as the way to death; but that we plead for is the <HI>true Light, Iohn</HI> 1.9. which lightens every man, and is the only true way that leads to life.</P>
<P>And whereas the consequence of their 23. seems to be to this effect; If every man had a light in him sufficient to guide him in right and good wayes, then Kings and Rulers should not punish men for walking in the wrong and evil wayes that seem good and right in their own eyes.</P>
<P><HI>Rep.</HI> I contrariwise conclude, that if men had not such a light in them, as is sufficient to guide them in good wayes, then Kings and Rulers should not punish them for going into evil wayes; for as 'twere an unjust thing to require (not of him, that seeing will not see, as those, <HI>Math.</HI> 13.) of such a blind man as never could see, to see the right way which was ne|ver shewed him, and to punish him for not walking therein; so were it in Rulers to punish men for following filthy wayes, and evil things, if they did not <HI>(videre meliora) i. e.</HI> see and know how to do better, for to him who knows good, and does it not, evil and declines it not, both which are known by the light that is in the world, <HI>i. e.</HI> in men (though some
<PB N="177" REF="400">
for want of heed, say the light in the conscience shews the evil, but not the good) to him only it is sin to condemnation.</P>
<P>The 25. from <HI>Prov.</HI> 22.6.15. concludes, <HI>That if each man have some such true light in him, then there's no need of training up children, in whose hearts foolishness is bound up, in the way they should go, by the rod and teaching; for what need of the rod</HI> (say they) <HI>then to drive fully out.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rep.</HI> I reply; to drive it out, and bring them into the way of <HI>wisdom,</HI> which is in them, and seen by them (but not much heeded till they smart far it) as well as the way of <HI>Folly</HI>: This Argument holds as much against Gods correcting such whom ye confess to know his will, and do it not, as against our correcting children, whom we correct for not doing what we know they know they shold do; for no father but he that's foolish will whip his child for any thing as a fault, but that which his child knew to be so: So fools come to be plagued, sayes the Spirit, because of offen|ces they fly out into, that (if they be not <HI>incorrigible</HI>) they with the wife may <HI>look well to, and ponder their goings.</HI> Our Doctrine concerning <HI>All mens</HI> knowing in some measure, by his <HI>Light within</HI> themselves, the good will of God, destroyes not, but establishes the <HI>whip for the Horse, the Bridle for the Afs, and the Rod for the back of such fools,</HI> as turn aside from the truth that's told them into folly; nor does this any more conclude a|gainst <HI>teaching children then m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t,</HI> with both which it is consistent, for the end of our teachings of both, are to turn them to attend to the <HI>Light and Truth</HI> it self within them, that doth teach them; yea, even <HI>children,</HI> as they come to a few years of <HI>Discretion</HI>: I remember well that before I could read the Scripture (which I could read when very young) I knew by that of God in me, and not from my Parents only, whose witness without could not have been credited therein by me, had not the <HI>Witness of God, which is the greater,</HI> testified the same within my self, that I should not lye, and was judged with fears of wrath, if ever I made a lye, as children are apt to do, to escape a whipping for a lesser fault.</P>
<P>If then it be ask't why we teach men and children: I answer, to bring and turn them (as <HI>Paul</HI> was sent to do) from the <HI>darkness,</HI> in which they walk beside it, into the <HI>Light,</HI> Which whether they walk in it or no, is yet in them; and because they are not come to it (as all <HI>true men</HI> do) but hate and decline it with the evil ones, whose condemnation it there|fore is, because though they come not into it, it is already come into them, <HI>Iohn</HI> 3.19.20.21.</P>
<P>And with this short self-same Answer, now its brought into my spi|rit, I shall here wipe out of the way a whole parcel of <HI>pedling Queries</HI> of <HI>R. Baxter,</HI> about the the Light, as they lie together in his E|pistle to the Reader, before <HI>I. Ts.</HI> book, into the pit of <HI>darkness,</HI> from whence they were exerted.</P>

else I know no Nation that hath not <HI>some of that Light</HI> which is <HI>Gods Gospel</HI> in them, any more then <HI>Paul</HI> did, who said, <HI>The Gospel is preached in eve|ry creature under Heaven,</HI> 1 Col. 23. and Rom. 10. <HI>Have they not all heard?</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> the Gospel) <HI>yes verily, &amp;c.</HI> The reason why all the Nations have so little as they all have, is, <HI>Because they come not to the Light which is come in|to them.</HI></P>
<P>R. B. Q. 2. <HI>Why did not the world believe in Christ even generally before his coming, if Reason was then a sufficient light?</HI></P>

<P>R. B. Q. 3. <HI>Why did Christ preach himself while he was on earth, if the people had sufficient light before?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Christ speaking then audibly to the outward ear, through that <HI>voice</HI> he then used, preach't himself indeed, that he was the <HI>Light of the World, the Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f God,</HI> and <HI>the Life and Light of men from the beginning,</HI> and not from that time only of that his outward appearance unto a few, <HI>Iohn</HI> 1.1.2. and to this end did he preach himself as <HI>a light in men</HI> (for <HI>the Word was made flesh, and dwelt in us,</HI> sayes <HI>Iohn, Ioh.</HI> 1.12.) bidding them believe in the light, <HI>i.e.</HI> his light in them, and so in himself who is the light, that they <HI>might be the children of it,</HI> and <HI>walk in the light</HI> while they had it, and come to the light, and such like; <HI>because the men to whom he preach't thus, were not come to that light of his, which was come into them.</HI></P>
<P>R. B. Q 4. <HI>Why did he send his Apostles to preach through the world, if the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ople had sufficient light before?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> To the same end for which he sent <HI>Iohn,</HI> 1 <HI>Ep.</HI> 1.1.4.5.6. that they might walk with God in the light, and not in the darkness, as they did, though the light was in them; and fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> which he sent <HI>Paul</HI> to the Na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ions, <HI>Act.</HI> 26. to turn them from the darkne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s to the light, from the power of Satan unto God; and because men wanted to be instructed which way to look for the Life of God which they had lost; and <HI>because they yee not yet come into that Light of God that only leads to it, which was come into them.</HI></P>
<P>R. B. Q. 5. <HI>Why did he set Pastors and Teachers in his Church, if all have a sufficient light within them?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> That his Church, which is in God, being turned from the world, and the <HI>darkness of it to the light,</HI> might by their <HI>memorandums of the things they knew,</HI> 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. be kept <HI>stedfast</HI> in their <HI>watch to the light, unmoveable and abundant, alwayes in that work of the Lord, believing in the light</HI> (which work the world are not yet come to) and to abide in Christ the Light (as <HI>branches</HI> in the <HI>Vine</HI>) and in the <HI>teachings of the Annointing,</HI> which is the <HI>truth, and no lye,</HI> that it might teach them by degrees all things, and lead them into <HI>all truth,</HI> as it had into some already, that the Saints might <HI>as branches grow up in all things into him, even the express Image and likeness of
<PB N="179" REF="401">
him, who is the one head over All to the body, and the express Image of the Fathers being,</HI> in whom is no guile, for the <HI>perfecting of the Saints</HI> (a thing ye seeming Saints deny to be attainable in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he body) <HI>for the work of the Ministry, for the edifying of the body, till all that are begotten into the nature, may come into the unity of the faith, and knowledge of Gods Son, even unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ,</HI> Eph. 4. Joh. 15. 1 Joh. 2. Finally, because men come to the light (if not exhorted to continue in their faith in it) may again <HI>go out from that light</HI> of God, which (unless it take occasion by their wilful departings from it, to depart at last from them) <HI>is come unto them, and continually in them.</HI></P>
<P>R. B. Q. 6. <HI>Why do the</HI> Quakers <HI>go up and down teaching men their own do|ctrines, if all men have sufficient light already?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Not their own doctrines, but the doctrines of Christ, and to call men into it, and to counsel such as are come into it, as <HI>Ioh. Ep.</HI> 2. to a|bide in Christs own doctrine or teaching, that they (as who doth not so hath neither) may <HI>have both Son and the Father</HI>; and because <HI>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n gene|rally are not come into that Light of God, which is already come into them.</HI></P>
<P>R. B. Q. 7. <HI>Why do they cry out against us, as being in darkness, when all men have sufficient light in them?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Were there no other thing but this one vain thought of yours, that there's no difference between mens being in the <HI>light,</HI> and the light's being in them, its enough of it self, without any more ado, to proclaim you to be in darkness, for if ye were in the <HI>light of common reason</HI> that is in you, 't would tell you, as well as the Scripture, <HI>that the light shines in the darkness, though it comprehends not the light,</HI> that it shews the way to them that walk beside it, though they walk not in it, because they hate it, but in the darkness which they love more then it, being fallen in love with its evil deeds, <HI>Ioh.</HI> 1. <HI>Ioh.</HI> 3. and so to the <HI>Query,</HI> we say ye are in darkness, because ye among other men <HI>are not yet come into that sufficient light, which if ye would once but singly look to, ye should feel is already come into you.</HI></P>
<P>R. B. Q. 8. <HI>Will they pray for more Light and Grace, or not, if not, they are impiously proud; if yea then it seems they have not yet light and grace sufficient?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> We do pray for <HI>more Light and Grace,</HI> and <HI>God gives more and more to the bumble,</HI> as I have shewed above; but if ye were not with all the <HI>climbers up another way, Iob.</HI> 10.1. either too proud to stoop to come into the <HI>knowledge of the truth by the door, the light,</HI> or so <HI>blind as to groap f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r the wall, like them that have no eyes,</HI> ye could not but see that their praying for more, and Gods giving more grace unto the humble, is so far from evin|cing that they have none, as that it evidently evinces they have some al|ready; for if men had no grace, and should pray for it, they might be said to pray for some; but no man can be properly said to pray for more light and grace, but such as (at least) have some already.</P>
<P>R. B. Q. 9. <HI>Whereas they say the Light within is sufficient, if obeyed, our Que|stion is, Whether it be sufficient to make men obey it? &amp;c. that's the Grace we are speaking of, that causeth men to hearken, believe, and obey, for faith is not of your selves, but it is the gift of God, and mens hearts must be opened as</HI> Lydia's <HI>was,</HI> Act. 16. <HI>to hear abd receive the truth revealed. Now to say that the Light
<PB N="180" REF="402">
or Grace which is given to cause us to believe and obey, is sufficient if we will be|lieve and obey, is ridiculous; as if Christ should have said to</HI> Lazarus, I <HI>will raise thee, if thou will raise thyself.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Here R.

<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Is the Light in <HI>America</HI> then any more insufficient to lead its fol|lowers to God, then the Light in <HI>Europe, Asia, Africa,</HI> the other three parts of the World?

<P>So ver. 8. <HI>He that commits sin is of the Devil, for the Devil</HI> Amartanei <HI>sinneth from the beginning</HI>: And because <HI>T.D.</HI> seems to put an <HI>Emphasis</HI> upon the word [<HI>sinneth</HI>] as well as [<HI>committeth sin</HI>] making the word [<HI>sinneth</HI>] (as here used) to amount to somewhat more then an <HI>ordina|ry sort of sinning,</HI> as here it intends some <HI>high or desperate degree of sin,</HI> even that which 1 <HI>Ioh.</HI> 5.16. is call'd <HI>Kat' Exoken, a sin unto death without reme|dy, or forgiveness for ever,</HI> because never to be repented of, as in opposi|tion to all other sins that men do commit, which (when this alone, being ever joy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'d with <HI>impenitency,</HI> is <HI>impardonable</HI>) are all, upon <HI>that true repentance</HI> they are yet in possibility of, who <HI>commit them, pard<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nable,</HI> or
<PB N="203" REF="413">
<HI>possible to be forgiven</HI>; for this is <HI>T. Ds. emphasis</HI> on the <HI>Substantive</HI> [<HI>Sin</HI>] (for I shall not wrong him so much as to take him meaning, as the <HI>Papists</HI> do, who put such difference between <HI>peccatum veniale,</HI> and <HI>mortale</HI>; as if <HI>some sins only without repentance were mortal, or to death, and some venial, or not to death,</HI> though <HI>not repented</HI> of at all, your <HI>Church of England</HI> opposing them in this, and holding <HI>every sin,</HI> yea, the least <HI>(unrepented of) unto death,</HI> though <HI>T. D.</HI> would have suspected me to be a <HI>Iesuite</HI> for a less matter) This concludes him <HI>that is born of God</HI> to be (even <HI>qua sic, as born of God</HI>) as easily liable to, and <HI>excludes</HI> him no more then it does the very wicked themselves, from the <HI>committing of any sin,</HI> that the wickedest can commit (except that ye call the sin against the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> it self) which is so gross an absurdity, that he can be no spiritually wise man that does not feel him to be spiritually infatuated that so imagines: For still though the <HI>Devil sinneth,</HI> and he <HI>that is of the Devil</HI> doth nothing else (but <HI>Nicode|mus,</HI> though a <HI>Master in Israel</HI> can't read this Birth of God (which is <HI>A|nothen, from above of water and the Spirit,</HI> John 1.12 John 3. <HI>which blows where it lists, and the Priests hear an outward sound thereof, but know not whence it comes, nor whether it goes, nor how he is that is born of the Spirit</HI>) as plain as 'tis in the <HI>Text,</HI> which they read more then <HI>that truth</HI> tells of) yet, as he <HI>that sinneth is of the Devil,</HI> and <HI>he that is of the Devil sinneth altogether,</HI> so he <HI>that sinneth not, but doth righteousness only, is of God; and he that is born of God, and the Spirit, which is Spirit, and not flesh, sinneth not at all, but overcometh the world, and keepeth himself, that the wicked one so much as toucheth him not,</HI> 1 John 5.18. <HI>neither can he sin, even</HI> eatenus, <HI>because born of God, whose own Seed, or incorruptible word,</HI> 1 Pet. 1.23. <HI>which condemns all, and consents to no sin, remaineth in him.</HI></P>
<P>Yet lest it hold not this way, <HI>T.D.</HI> puts another <HI>string to his De|vils Bow,</HI> and shoots out another sense, as <HI>emphatically</HI> as he can, with all his might, by which notwithstanding (as he did in the other three Questions above spoken to) he hath <HI>utterly lost the Game,</HI> and given the <HI>whole Cause,</HI> and this <HI>Question</HI> contended for, so clearly (if there should be no more shooting about it) that by all his <HI>scrambling shifts,</HI> whereby he <HI>scrabbles and scraffies</HI> to gather it up again, he will, never <HI>recover of the wound</HI> that he hath unawares given to himself; for mark how his own <HI>emphasis</HI> on the Verb <HI>Poiei</HI> undoes him: <HI>It notes</HI> (quoth he) <HI>to make a trade or business of sin as the Devil does, who never ceased to sin: Thus indeed the Saints sin not, but a course of sin is broken off, and there is not such a free trade between the Soul and sin, as in the state of unregeneracy, whereof this is gi|ven for one Character that cannot cease from sin,</HI> 2 Pet. 2.18.</P>
<P><HI>Rep.</HI> To say nothing here, how that Parish Priests do make a <HI>Trade and business of sin, of preaching for hire, persecuting for Tythe, promoting the Popes Pay, and Parish posture, since they were sworn to endeavour the extir|pation of all Popery, looking every one for his gain from his quarter,</HI> which <HI>un-Saints</HI> themselves, and states them still in <HI>unregeueracy,</HI> if <HI>T.Ds.</HI> words be true (as its sure enough they are) when he sayes thus, <HI>Indeed the Saints do not sin, this is in the state of unregeneracy, whereof this is one cha|racter, they cannot cease from sin</HI>; for howbeit, they have long since well

<P>But to let pass that, observe Secondly, How <HI>T.D. distinguishes the Saints from the Devil,</HI> and the <HI>unregenerate ones that are yet born of him,</HI> by this <HI>Character</HI> (which is the true one) of <HI>ceasing,</HI> and <HI>not ceasing from sin: The Devil</HI> (quoth he) and <HI>the unregenerate, they make a free trade and business of sin, and never cease to sin</HI> (true enough) <HI>but thus the Saints sin not, but the course of sin,</HI> which the other keep, <HI>is broken off, so that theres not this free trade between sin and their Souls, as is among others, who do</HI> hoc age|re, <HI>sin, and cease not from it, but the Saints they cease from it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rep. Caiphas-like,</HI> more truth then <HI>T.D.</HI> was well aware of when he told it, even so much, and no less (and no more do we need from him) then whereby he has as fully <HI>yielded us our Question,</HI> as I have shewed he hath done all the rest we had to do with him about, excepting that of the <HI>infallibility of the Gospel Ministry</HI> affirmed by us, which yet he hath also yielded so far to towards the truth of, as will force him to give us all that too at last, sith he hath confessed the <HI>meer fallibility</HI> of their own, the <HI>ignorance</HI> of which I do not much marvel that he confesses, since he charges Christ himself with such <HI>ignorance and fallibility,</HI> as whereby (<HI>unawares to himself,</HI> and not <HI>knowing that he was such a one</HI>) he <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ose a De|vil to be his Minister.</HI> See page 45. 1 Pamp. which Devil yet (say we) to wit <HI>Iudas,</HI> though he prov'd so at last by transgression, falling back from that true <HI>Apostleship</HI> he once obtain'd, <HI>Act.</HI> 1. was not known to be so, because (saving <HI>T.

<P>But as to the Questiou again, which is, <HI>Whether in this life the Saints may attain to such a state of freedome from sin, as not to sin, but to cease from it, and live without it?

</LIST></P>
<P><HI>Rep. True, Perfect</HI> and <HI>upright</HI> are one, and both import no lesse then a <HI>man that sins not, Eccles.</HI> 7.29. <HI>Adam</HI> in innocency was <HI>perfect,</HI> it's said God made man upright: For while any are <HI>upright</HI> they are answerable to the <HI>Law</HI> or <HI>Light</HI> lent them to live by, which <HI>sin is the transgression of,</HI> and so no <HI>transgressours,</HI> and while they transgresse that Law they are not <HI>perfect,</HI> nor <HI>upright</HI> but <HI>crooked</HI> and so accounted. Whether it be <HI>Iob himself,</HI> whom <HI>T. D.</HI> so much instances in and insists on, p. 10. 1. Pamp. and p. 6. 2. Pamp. or <HI>David himselfe,</HI> or any other: Therefore while <HI>David</HI> stood in <HI>integrity and uprightnesse</HI> (as mostly he did) it <HI>preserved</HI> him, and God so accounted him and justified him, as an <HI>upright man,</HI> as he did <HI>Iob.</HI> 1.1. in the same case: but where he turn'd aside into the deceit &amp; defilement, God held him <HI>not upright,</HI> but <HI>hypocriticall, false, filthy and sinfull:</HI> much lesse did he therein hold him <HI>guiltlesse</HI> and <HI>justifie,</HI> him (as most ignorantly <HI>T.

and murder</HI>; in which juncture nevertheless <HI>T.D.</HI> sayes <HI>he was not in a con|demned state, but in a justified estate:</HI> The Scripture exempts him from <HI>justification,</HI> so far, that it vouchsafes him not that <HI>denomination</HI> of an <HI>up|right man</HI> in that matter of <HI>Vriab,</HI> but brands him with the name of a <HI>pittylesse, blood guilty man,</HI> a <HI>secret evill doer in the sight of the Lord, a despiser of him, and his comandement, and a causer of Gods enemies to blaspheme his Name, Psal.</HI> 51. 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 12.6, 9, 10, 12, 14. Howbeit this one thing by the way is worth noting concerning <HI>T. D.</HI> (not for any good that is in it or in <HI>T. D.</HI> as touching his demeanour in it) that when he speaks of the <HI>Saints good</HI> and <HI>duty</HI> that they do, he says that's not <HI>perfect,</HI> but an <HI>unclean thing, dung and filthy rags</HI>: yea, that he calls <HI>sin</HI> and <HI>iniquity</HI> p. 7. 2. Pamp. <HI>They sin</HI> (quoth he) <HI>in doing good: duties holy for the matter are iniquity for the manner <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f performance:</HI> but when the <HI>Saints</HI> (as in <HI>Davids</HI> ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e) <HI>commit Adultery and Murder,</HI> he pronounces them <HI>blessed,</HI> as having no <HI>guile</HI> nor <HI>guilt</HI> in their Spi|rit, but <HI>sincere</HI> (which is the same with <HI>upright</HI> or <HI>perfect</HI>) see p. 11. 1. Pamp. <HI>David</HI> (quoth he) Psal. 32.2. <HI>Pronounces the man blessed, which hath no guile in his Spirit or sincere, which himselfe was at that time, though under the guilt of a great sin</HI> v. 5. <HI>which is by interpreters supposed to be the same sins for which</HI> psal. 51. <HI>was composed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rep.</HI> Heres <HI>Doctrine of Divinity</HI> with a witnesse; when the <HI>Saints</HI> do the <HI>best good,</HI> they <HI>sin,</HI> their <HI>holy things</HI> are all as an <HI>unclean thing,</HI> their <HI>righteousness</HI> is <HI>dung, filthy rags</HI> (though <HI>T. D.</HI> holds also that <HI>Paul had no righteousness which was not Christs</HI> p. 22. 1. Pamp. nor any <HI>righteousnesse, but what from Christ he received</HI>) their <HI>performing</HI> duty at least is no lesse then <HI>iniquity,</HI> but when they are <HI>under the guilt</HI> of such <HI>great sins</HI> as <HI>Adultery</HI> and <HI>Murder,</HI> oh blessed men they at that time have no <HI>guile in their Spirits,</HI> are in <HI>sincerity</HI> or (to speakin the <HI>diminutive Phrase</HI> by which sometimes he lessens the <HI>foul faults</HI> and <HI>great sins</HI> of the <HI>Saints</HI>) at <HI>the worst</HI> but under <HI>infirmity</HI>: But be it this or be it that, <HI>greater</HI> or <HI>lesse, better</HI> or <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">se, infirmity</HI> or <HI>iniquity, good</HI> or <HI>evill, duty</HI> or <HI>dung, righteousness</HI> or <HI>rags, holy or unclean,</HI> the <HI>upshot</HI> of all is this, the <HI>men are blessed men,</HI> what ere they do, they are never in a <HI>condemned,</HI> but ever in a <HI>justified estate</HI>; and let their works be as they will, <HI>perfect</HI> or not <HI>perfect, good</HI> or <HI>duty,</HI> which they call <HI>unclean, dung, ini|quity</HI> or <HI>filthy rags,</HI> their <HI>persons</HI> [though thus <HI>sinning</HI>] are ever <HI>Saints,</HI> and <HI>believers,</HI> which together with <HI>their works, are accepted with God,</HI> who yet (say I) never <HI>accepted</HI> any such works, as are <HI>iniquity</HI> and <HI>sin,</HI> nor any <HI>Per|sons,</HI> while they are the <HI>workers of them.</HI></P>
<P>And as to the remnant of <HI>T.

<P><HI>Rep.</HI> I shall answer that no other wise then out of <HI>T. D's.</HI> own mouth, who (as I am, as to my self, credibly enough inform'd by <HI>A. P.</HI>) in a meeting among many at <HI>Sandwich,</HI> since those <HI>publike disputes</HI> we had since the edition of both his books, being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the <HI>precise time</HI> wherein perfect purging is, answered <HI>when the Soul, being passed out of the body, is in its passage between here and heaven.</HI> (or to that purpose) which, is <HI>but so,</HI> and no <HI>somer,</HI>
<PB N="215" REF="419">
must then be before the <HI>resurrection</HI> he talks of: and if he will not be <HI>con|vinced</HI> by his <HI>own words,</HI> that sin is excluded before the resurrection, much lesse is it likely he should believe any of mine. Adding this however, <HI>viz.</HI> That if ye lye down in your graves with your bones full of sin, ye shall rise with them full of sorrow, was wont to be the Priests argument to the people, to perswade them to a purging from all sin before they dye, because no purging to be lookt after death, much lesse so long of after, as at the re|surrection. <HI>Verbum sat sapienti.</HI></P>
<P>The next answer of <HI>T.D.</HI> is to the Argument urged from <HI>Psal.</HI> 119.1, 2, 3. which he, who renders all we said as <HI>weakly, lamely</HI> and <HI>decrepidly</HI> as he <HI>possi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly</HI> can for his own ends, repeats not <HI>half so much as by the halves,</HI> for I wisht him him to heed all the 3. verses which were then <HI>peraphras'd</HI> to him, and <HI>argued f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">m</HI> in such wise as followeth, <HI>viz. they that are undefiled in the way,</HI> are not defiled in the way; <HI>they that walk in the Law of the Lord,</HI> do not transgresse it; <HI>they that keep his Testimonies,</HI> do not break them; <HI>they that seek him with their whole heart,</HI> serve him not by the halves, not him and sin, but him alone and wholly; <HI>they that done iniquity,</HI> do not sin; <HI>they that walk in his way,</HI> do not walk besides it; but there were some (or else they could not be <HI>pronounced blessed,</HI> for the Spirit <HI>blesses</HI> not such men as <HI>are not</HI>) and such now may be (for <HI>quod fieri potuir potest,</HI> what <HI>was then,</HI> is <HI>possible</HI> to be <HI>now</HI>) who are <HI>undefiled in the way, walk in the Law of the Lord, that keep his Testimonies, and seek him with their whole heart, who do no iniquity, and walk in his way</HI>: Therefore 'tis <HI>possible</HI> that the <HI>Saints</HI> may be freed from sinning in this life:</P>
<P>The summe of what <HI>T. D. Replyes</HI> to all this is <HI>that the Phrases are hy|perbolicall</HI>: which is a little better at least, but how much I list not here to tell, then if <HI>T.D.</HI> had said, they are <HI>hypocriticall,</HI> or (as his wonted replyes are, when he can find no better, as I have shewed above) the <HI>meaning of the words cannot be as the letter of them doth import,</HI> the <HI>Spirit meanes</HI> not <HI>as he sayes, the Spirits meaning may be mistaken, when his words are taken in the most ordinary liter all sense, and so it would be, if undefiled and doing no iniquity, should be meant truely of being undefiled and doing none iniquity indeed</HI> p. 11. 1. Pamp. <HI>Its meant of having respect to all Gods Commandements in re|spect of design and endeavour though falling short in accomplishment,</HI> v. 6. <HI>being explanatory of the other.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rep.</HI> Oh the <HI>impudency</HI> of this man? what have we (for all this he sayes against the <HI>plain literall sense</HI> of the <HI>Spirits words</HI>) whereby to assure us that the <HI>Spirit means not as his own words import,</HI> but onely in that <HI>shambling sense</HI> which <HI>T.

<PB N="216" REF="420">
and <HI>endeavours,</HI> they are <HI>to believe</HI> they <HI>must never do,</HI> it being <HI>not possi|ble to be done:</HI> they must alwayes dwell at the <HI>sign</HI> of the <HI>Labour in Vain,</HI> and be striving to <HI>wash the Blak-More white</HI> and alwayes <HI>roling</HI> Sysiphus's <HI>Stone; ever purifying never pure, ever mortifying their earthly members, forni|cation, uncleannesse, inordinate affection to the world, evill concupiscence, covetous|nesse, Idolatry, Anger, Wrath, Lying, Filthy Communication, but never</HI> while they live obtain to witnesse these so <HI>mortifyed,</HI> as to be no more <HI>committed,</HI> least such an <HI>absurdity</HI> as this should follow, that the <HI>Scripture</HI> [which I con|fesse is found contradicting these <HI>meaning-makers</HI> on it] <HI>be found contra|dictory to it self</HI>: for [quoth T.

<P><HI>Rep.</HI> Of all the peices of proof against the <HI>possibility of perfection,</HI> that ever I heard, made by T. D. himself or any other, This is the most <HI>monstrously rediculous</HI>: draw this rude and crude matter into its own form and the force of it runs ihus.</P>
<P>That, which God <HI>requires</HI> and <HI>commands us to be alwayes doing, and constantly endeavouring to do during this life, can never possibly be done or effected during this life: for if it be once fully done, effected and accomplished, then we can't be alwayes doing it, and so not obey what God requires. But God requires we should be alwayes mortifying, constantly endea|vouring to represse and subdue the actions of</HI> corrupt nature <HI>during this life</HI>: <HI>Therefore its impossible</HI> [<HI>unlesse</HI> we be left uncapable of doing what God requires] <HI>that we should in this life perfectly mortify and subdue them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In short, that, which must be ever</HI> in fieri <HI>while we live, can't be</HI> in facto esse <HI>till we dy,</HI> but <HI>we are</HI> (in fieri) <HI>to be alwayes purifying our selves while we live</HI>: <HI>Therefore</HI> [<HI>least there</HI> be no more work of that kind for us to do] <HI>we may not lawfully or cannot possibly be pure till we ay,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rep.</HI> This is even as hand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ome a shift, as if a <HI>Debtor</HI> promising to owe &amp; en|deavour to pay his <HI>Creditor</HI> 20l. should never pay it him, upon the pretence of an <HI>impossibility</HI> to perform his promise, if he do once <HI>pay the mony,</HI> I <HI>must ever owe him the mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y,</HI> and stand engaged to <HI>endeavour to pay it,</HI> there|fore [unlesse I make my selfe uncapable of performing my promise, which I am alwayes mindfull of performing] I must never actually <HI>pay it.</HI></P>
<P>But now as to T.

<P><HI>T.D.</HI> David <HI>excludes himself from the blessed Estate, if undefiled and doing no iniquity be meant strictly here, sith his wish,</HI> v. 5. <HI>and other passages shew he was not free from sin, which surely</HI> David <HI>did not intend, because,</HI> Psal. 32.2.5. <HI>he pronounces blessednesse to the man in whose Spirit is no guile, who is sincere, as himself was at that time, though then under the guilt</HI> (as is supposed by

interpreters) <HI>of his great sin of murder and adultery, for which</HI> Psal. 51. <HI>was composed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rep.</HI> 1st. some of this dirty stuff I spoke to but a little before, the false|hood of which is evident, for whereas the Scripture sayes, David <HI>was not upright in the matter of</HI> Uriah, <HI>T.D.</HI> sayes, yea he was <HI>sincere and had no guile in his Spirit</HI> when under the guilt of those great sins. 2d. as to the rest, what if <HI>David did exclude himself?</HI> If he were under those great evills, he might well <HI>exclude himself from the blessednesse of sincere ones,</HI> till he came into the sense of Gods Love again &amp; to repentance; while he pronounced the <HI>undefiled ones blessed</HI> that did no such iniquity, he had reason to take the <HI>curse</HI> as his own portion to himself, and to cry out of himself, <HI>Talaiporos Anthroyos O wretched man that I am,</HI> more deser|vedly then <HI>Paul,</HI> who (though (in zeal of God) shedding blood) yet was, 'tis like, never such a deep <HI>Adulterer,</HI> and deliberate <HI>Murderer</HI> as <HI>David</HI> was in <HI>Vriahs</HI> case: and as God said to <HI>Israel</HI> Hos: 9.1: so might <HI>David</HI> say to himself, <HI>rejoyce not thou as other</HI> (honest) <HI>people, for thou a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t gone a who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing from thy God</HI>: and if that were his case (as thou intimatest it was) wherein he was so <HI>desperately defiled</HI> with <HI>filth</HI> and <HI>blind,</HI> he might well exclude himself from it, having no reason to take to himself the blessing of the <HI>undefiled</HI>: or whether he excluded himself or no from it, this I am sure (for all thy foolish dreams about Davids <HI>good Condition, Iustification, Blessednesse and Vprightness,</HI> whilst under the guilt of those sordid Iniqui|ties, that the Scripture excludes him in that case so far from blessednesse, that it concludes him neither upright (as thou simply dost) not so much as a respecter of Gods Commands, which at least thou dorest, he was, even when he called that all abomination (whiles thou Judg him (as Indeed thou doest) to have respect to Gods commandments, that de|spises both God and him, for 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 12. as much as thou smoothest over those <HI>abominable</HI> businesses the better to sooth thy self and some sinful Saints like thy self, in your lusts and iniquities, as no more then Saints infir|mities, who have respect to all Gods Commandemets in respect of design and indeavour, though falling short in accomplishing: yet when <HI>Nathan</HI> came to him well-nigh a year after he had lyen, in that dirty pickle in impenitency under the guilt of those gross impieties, he is so far from sowing pillows and daubing with such untempered morter, as thou dost, and from including him in the lists of sincerity, and owning him as one that had respect to all Gods Commands, that he convinces him of his wicked hypocrisies and condemns him, as one that had despised both God himself and his Commandements.</P>
<P>Next <HI>T.

For [say they] if <HI>Paul</HI> complained of <HI>a body of sin and death while he liv'd, and how he was sold under sin,</HI> and <HI>carryed captive to the Law of it, and of the Law of sin wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ring in his members against the Law in his mind, so that he could not do the good he should, but when he would do good, evill was pre|sent with him, and also of a Thorne in his flesh, a Messenger of Satan to buffet him</HI> [as he does 2 Cor. 1, 2, 3. &amp;c.] <HI>and all this after his conversion to his dying day: Then much lesse can any other Saints expect to be set so free from sin, by what power soever in this life, as to live and not sin, and such like! But Paul did so, there|fore what man can do otherwise? Who can ever live and not sin?</HI></P>
<P>Thus they argue against <HI>Qua.</HI> as a damnable sort of <HI>Hereticks,</HI> that de|liver a <HI>doctrine of Devils,</HI> because they hold out, as attainable, that <HI>hellish thing,</HI> as they count it, call'd <HI>holiness,</HI> and such <HI>freedom from sin in this life, so as not to commit iniquity any more</HI>; not considering all this while that <HI>Paul</HI> in those terms speakes what he once was, [yea even after his conversion to <HI>the light</HI>] till sin was wholly subdued, <HI>by the light condemning it in his flesh and</HI>
<PB N="228" REF="426">
<HI>bringing forth in him judgement over it into victory,</HI> and not of what he was at the writing thereof, in which time he sayes the Law of the Spirit had made him free from that Law of sin: Not yet heeding at all that the <HI>Thorn in the flesh</HI> was not a <HI>transgression,</HI> but a <HI>temptation,</HI> with which God exercised him, that he might shew the <HI>sufficiency</HI> of his own <HI>grace</HI> to support and keep him from <HI>transgression,</HI> even from that sin of being exalted above mea|sure, and that no lesse then 14. years before he wrote this, and not just then when, or while he wrote it, much lesse a <HI>transgression</HI> that remain'd unmortified in him till his dying day.</P>
<P>One argument more I shall urge from <HI>I: O's:</HI> own book thus <HI>viz:</HI> If perfect Salvation from sin be the proper end of the Scripture, and it be perfect to that its end, and does perfect it, and yet does what it does in this present world [or nowhere] to which it is accomodated only, and ceases to do ought into the world to come, then that perfect Salvation must be wrought out by it, or here, or no where at all: But all the former are asserted abundantly ore and ore again as truth, by <HI>I: O:</HI> himself, <HI>Ex:</HI> 3: 5: 28: 22: Therefore the conclusion is consequently true that its either here or no where: Again they all say in opposition to the <HI>Pope,</HI> ther's no Purgatory in the world to come, therefore it must be here or no where, unlesse they know any other world between this present world &amp; that which is to come, which middle world though I have heard some talk of a world in the Moon, I am not yet acquainted with.</P>
<P>There be some therefore <HI>that sin not, in whom the Law is not transgrest, but sin condemn'd and judged in their flesh,</HI> so that the <HI>Righteousnes of the Law by Christs Power is fulfild in them, and they walk not after the the flesh but after the Spirit,</HI> which is the end of Gods <HI>sending his Son in the likenesse of sinful flesh, and of his sending out his light into mens hearts, even that Law of the Spirit of Life which is in himself,</HI> viz: <HI>to make men free from that law of sin and death, which sometimes they obeyed to condemnation, and to condemn sin in the flesh, and out of it also by his Iudgment brought forth into victory over it, that his Righteous|ness might be Revealed, and the Righteousness of the Law, which he fulfilled in himself, might be [by him] fulfilled [in us] also:</HI></P>
<P>Many more passages truly there are in <HI>T: D's:</HI> and <HI>I: O's:</HI> books [besi|des these many that have bin spoken to] some of which are worth no more [being but confusion] then confutation, and some of which also are not worth so much, and therefore I shall draw to an end [making many books and much writing being wearisom] but by these men maybe admonished what a meer Fallible kind of guidance they must expect from their Uni|versity Admired leaders, while they hate the Light of God in their own hearts, and hang only on their lying lips for their learning the plain|Soul-saving Truth of Christ,</P>

<P>The first, whereby (<HI>Alas poor man</HI> he hampers himself (and to as little ef|fect) most horribly to evince the Points to be as high as <HI>Ezra</HI> at least (which salves not his <HI>Assertion</HI> of the <HI>Texts integrity</HI> however, were it granted him) and not so <HI>novel an invention</HI> as of the <HI>Tiberian Massorites,</HI> is an <HI>extraordinary excentrick boundlesly bitter</HI> invective, as against the <HI>Iewes</HI> in general, in their rancor against <HI>Christ,</HI> wickedly attempting the <HI>restoration</HI> of their <HI>Religion</HI> un|der <HI>Barchochab</HI> and <HI>Rabbi Iuda,</HI> by the compiling of their <HI>Talmuds,</HI> and much other <HI>inpertinent stuffe, and story,</HI> of which I.

<P>This is one of I. Os.

<P>How worthlesse and frivolous then? what childishnesse, light|nesse? what <HI>froth, smoake, nothing</HI> are the thoughts of I.

But if this Argument of I. O. had any such force in it as were worth reselling (as indeed it hath not) yet, if we should say nothing to it. I.

<P>So <HI>odde</HI> and <HI>Antick</HI> is I.

<P>To which (say I) That though of all the Contradictions that I.

<P>Somtimes they call this very light, whereby duties and <HI>divine things</HI> are discerned, <HI>universall</HI> and <HI>common to all</HI> (as the <HI>Qua</HI>; do i. e. in some measure, though not to all in the same) but when so, then no other but <HI>naturall,</HI> as in opposition to <HI>supernaturall</HI> and <HI>spirituall</HI>; Witnesse T.D. p. 1.1 pamp. <HI>Naturall and supernaturall light are two, an I though all have the one, yet few the other,</HI> and I.

Witnesse also T. D. who, though he (together with I.O. p. 77.

An inward <HI>spirituall</HI> light, which discerns <HI>spirituall things spiritually</HI> in order to the <HI>supernaturall, spirituall</HI> and <HI>ultimate</HI> end: yet a little lower, viz.

His sayings and doings do amply confirm it.</Q> And p. 88. 89 they go on thus;
<Q>Though the Jewes contradicted and blasphemed, the <HI>Romane</HI> Emperour raged, <HI>Lucian</HI> jeered, <HI>Libanism</HI> wrangled, <HI>Iulian</HI> calumniated, Papists, corrupt Gnosticks, Hereticks, Fanaticks, Quakers, [<HI>here they abomi|nably bely the truth, for the</HI> Quakers <HI>call all and only to the light of Christ</HI>] adulterate and cloud the truth of Christ, they do but pisse against the Sun, the light of Christs Doctrine, the truth of the Gospell doth and will shine forth, nor can all the cavills (<HI>say they</HI>) of moderne Atheists, or the dust raised by new Phantasticks, take away the brightnesse of Christs light, or hinder its enlightning others then themselves, and shall we after all the Arguments given of Christs being the true light, follow after <HI>ignes fatuos,</HI> [<HI>who these be but that fraternity, who would have men follow their fancies, and not Christs light in the Conscience, which is that the Quakers call to, I know not</HI>] What reall comfort or spirituall help to holinesse or heavenly directions do they give to lead men to God, better then Christ hath done? May you not discern a vain glorious spirit, a self-seeking, proud, carnall spirit in them, what do their censures of others shew, but a mind to extoll themselves? their affected speech, looks, carriage, but a desire to hide their falshood? what do all the devices of Iesuits, Popes, and their Agents tend to but ei|ther by force or subtlety to set up the monstrous powers of the man of sin, and their own domineerlng over mens consciences underhim? [<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aSenus recte quidem sed et etiam de te fabula O Parochialis Sacerdos</HI>] What is in their conclave but pollicy? in their counsell but deceit? in their Iesuists and Casuists but jugglihg? shall we go after such Masters and leave Christ? Remember we that one is our Master, even Christ; when any shall sollicit us not to adhere to Christ as our Teacher, reject them: Christ hath warned you, [<HI>say they, and so say I too as concerning any that lead forth from his light with|in therefore, saith he, go not forth after them, nor follow them</HI>] If any say low here is Christ or there [<HI>and so do all Priests and Professors, and their Teachers in their sundry forms and outward observations, in which they look for the Kingdome which comes not in them</HI>] believe it not. We will not venture our lives upon

<P><Q>Alas, what can we expect but if we follow blind leaders, as all are that teach the things of God otherwise then Christ and his Apostles did [<HI>who, say I, called all along to walk in the light within</HI>] we should fall with them in|to the Ditch, into everlasting perdition? On the otherside there is so much plain and clear light in Christs doctrine as will guide our feet in the way of peace; Away then with all such obtruded insinuating Teachers as indea|vour to hide from us the light of Christ shining in his Doctrine, recorded in Scripture; Let's say <HI>none but Christ, none but Christ,</HI> that Christ which preached, dyed at <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> that word of his which is written in my Bible [<HI>of which the Bible testifies say I, that its near in the heart to heare and do it</HI>] shall be my light: to the Testimony of Jesus [<HI>which sayes tho Scripture is the spirit of prophecy, the sure word of prophecy, that as a light shineth in the dark place of the heart, and is to be taken heed to</HI>] to his Everlasting Gospell I stick.</Q></P>
<P><Q>So <HI>Bixt.</HI> Ep. p. 7. (<HI>speaking of the Qua</HI>:) Do they affirm that all men have the light of reason? who denyeth it of any but Idiots and Infants? Do they maintain that this light is from Iesus Christ, both as the Authour and restorer of nature? and by whom among us is this denyed? Do they say that repaired or reprived nature may be fitly called grace? about this also we have no mind to quarrell with them, so they will not exclude superna|turall grace thereby (<HI>as we do not, but hereby conclude it</HI>) Do they hold that common supernaturall light is given to many (at least) of the unsan|ctified, &amp;c. and who contradicteth them in this? Do they hold that as the Sun is appointed in nature to be the light of every man that cometh into the World, though shutting our eyes may exclude it; So Christ is by office the Sun in the world of grace, giving men actually all the gracious light they have, being sufficient himself to enlighten all, and giving them an illu|minating word, which is sufficient in its own kind to do its own part, though many are blind, and for their sin are deprived of the communica|tion of this light? why all this we maintain as well as they: do they say that all this light (within us and without us) is to be hearkened to and obeyed? why what man did they ever speak with that's a Christian; [<HI>no Christians indeed say I, but too many Antichristians</HI>] that denyeth it?</Q></P>
<P>[<HI>See what a deal of the Quakers doctrine concerning learning only at Christs light is here uttered by these men</HI> R.B. I.T. <HI>who yet hate the self same doctrine at their hearts when the Quakers teach it; also in many other places they teach much more to the same purpose; putting men on to attendance to the light, yea even the light within every man,</HI> as p. 40, 41.]
<Q>This light usefull for two ends; First, To restrain men from excesse of sin, &amp;c. As he gave a Law to the <HI>Iewes</HI> because of transgression, to restrain them or abate punishments; so to other people he gave a law in themselves to prevent the extirpation of the Nations by bri|dling them in their lusts, thorow conscience of sin and fear of punishment. Secondly, Besides this God hath another end, that they might be inexcu|sable who sinned against the light in them, and God justified in his Sen|tence and judgment upon them. </Q>[<HI>Observe how this light within is owned by them as the Law of God, which T.D. affirming the work of the Law only to be there,
<PB N="37" REF="444">
yet denyes to be in the heathens hearts, to the contradiction of these men and of him|self also in that other plaee,</HI> p. 16.2. pamp. <HI>Where</HI> (to go round again) <HI>he con|fesses much of the holy matter of the Scripture to be written upon the hearts of the hea|thens, and that to be their Rule) I say as the Law of God which is spirituall, holy, just and good, and to be obeyed, for else transgression of it could not be sin deserving judgment, for sin is no other then the transgression of the Law.</HI>]</P>
<P>So p. 82.83. they go on thus,
<Q>If the light shine into thy soul from Christ so as any convictions or discoveryes of truth from Christ get into thee, [<HI>and some convictions they confesse all hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by the light within</HI>] take heed thou hold it not in unrighteousnesse, nor seek to quench it, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.18. Wrath to all that hold truth in unrighteousnesse, when lust imprisons light, no en|trance for the light of Christ into that soul, there must be a love of the light: Its the greatest sign of a man willfully evill, when he hates the light; and its a good sign of a man truly good, when he can delight in that light (<HI>mork</HI>) which discovers his own euills, </Q>[<HI>What light is that which discovers a mans own evills but the light within? the letter without doth</HI> de jure <HI>only, the light with|in doth</HI> de facto <HI>discover mens own evill</HI>]
<Q>Christ hath determined this to be the great condemnation, that men love darknesse rather then light </Q>[<HI>or else the Heathen could not be condemned, say I, who have and yet hate the light within, for they have no letter without</HI>] for thats the sign they side with the Prince of darknesse, and men that do truth come to the light that their deeds may be manifest, &amp;c. The more light is rejected, the more purely voluntary any sin is, when men are willingly ignorant, they are incurably evill, &amp;c. Each person is to make their use of the light within him, so far as it is light and usefull. Certainly it concerns every man so far as to look to the light within him, (<HI>mark</HI>) that he do not, as tis said of some, Job 24.13. Rebell against the Light, [<HI>which Text in Iob I. O. interprets of the letter, but I. T. to the confutation of I. O. (truly with us) of the Common light within men</HI>] A mens conscience is so far a law to him, that though it cannot of it self justifie [<HI>which is contrary to</HI> Rom. 2. <HI>which sayes their inward thought as well excuses the Heathen when they do well, as accuses when they do ill, and excusation and justifi|cation, or to excuse, clear, justifie are all one</HI>] yet it may condemn him:</P>
<P><HI>So p,</HI> 37. <HI>they go on thus,</HI>
God hath imprinted in all, even the most Barba|rous people, some relique of light, though in some it is so small [<HI>that may be say we, for all have not the same, but all some measure of Gods light, which these men somtimes call darknesse, delusive and dangerous, and degrees vary not the na|ture of the case</HI>] <Q>that it can hardly be perceived whether there be any sense of sin or wrath, of duty or reward, of God or Devill, Heaven or Hell. Secondly, Some people that never had the Gospell nor the Law made known to them as the Jewes and Christians have had, yet have attained to so much knowledge and practice of morall duties </Q>[<HI>Mark, morall duties are the main things of the Law, and required in the morall Law, viz. To do as we would be done by, which faith Christ is the Law and Prophets,</HI> Math. 7.
<Q><HI>The sum, substance, and upshot of all, and more then all offering and sacrifice, so that the Iews failing in these weightiar matters, viz. Iudgment, mercy, faith, &amp;c. all outward oblations and observations were abhorred</HI>] that in some acts of righteousnesse,
temperance, chastity, fidelity, and such vertues they have equallized at
<PB N="38" REF="445">
least in respect of their outward demeanour toward men, if not exceeded not only <HI>Iewes</HI> [<HI>who had the Scripture, as our Scribes have, and search, as much in it</HI>] but also [<HI>the more shame for the most of you filthy, fruitlesse, faithlesse Christians the while, whom very heathens will therefore judge</HI>] the most Christi|ans, Thirdly, And in the knowledge of God, though therein they were most defective, yet they attained to so much knowledge and right appre|hension of him, as enabled them to correct the Vulgar errours concerning God.</Q></P>
<P>[<HI>See how far beyond our vulgar Christians, and very Christian Clergy men, that have the letter to boast, talk &amp; trade on, the light within hath led the very Ethnicks that have heeded it, by these mens own confession; But they go on yet further prea|ching up the light with the Qua: thus, p.</HI> 84. It will concern those who own
<Q>Christ as their light, to judge themselves and their wayes by his light: [<HI>This act of self judgment is within faith I.O. Seconding that morall instinct of good and evill, that is imprinted by God on the Conscience from the innate light therein</HI>] It is the great benefit of the light that it doth make manifest, Eph. 5.13. Thus by the light of Christ the evill of our wayes is reproved, the wayes of God approved: Now this is no small benefit to have the light to discern our errors, which without light from Christ we should never have understood, A wise Christian will be often judging himself by the light of the Law, dis|covering his Transgressions [<HI>That m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st needs be the Law in the Conscience which, de facto, shewes every mans own sins to himselfe</HI>] It will be needfull not on|ly to use the light of Christ to judge our selves by, but also to order our actions by. I am the light of the World, saith Christ, he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness. There cannot be unsafe walking by Christs light, there is no danger when Christ our light goes before, walk in the light saith Christ, while ye have the light, lest darknesse come upon you: how many millions are there of souls perplexed and tortured all their life with fears and doubts for want of walking by the light of Christ in Scripture [<HI>which, say I, is that in the conscience which the Scripture mainly calls to</HI>] and chu|sing rather to walk by a light and sparks of their own kindling [<HI>alias their own wisdome, conceits, sences and meanings on the Scripture, traditions in worship, and such like which they call light</HI>] which in the end either goes quite out, or burns so dim as to leave them in darknesse of spirit and horror of consci|ence; and no marveile since such as neglect the word preached [<HI>which is that word of faith i.e. which men are to beleeve in unto life, which the Scripture testifies, and the Apostles preached to be nigh in mens hearts to heave and do it</HI>] should follow the mares of humane reason, the examples, customes, and dic|tates of men, and in conclusion ly down in sorrow, Isa. 40.11. Such foolish fires will lead to nothing but bogs and precipices, but Christ the true light when his Gospell is followed (<HI>which is the light in the heart,</HI> 2 Cor; 4.5, 6.) guides the feet of men into the way of peace: The light of Christ is to be used as our weapons or Tools to defend ourselves, or to work with, let us put off the works of darknesse, and put on the armour of light, the truth is light, is the chiefest instrument for safety and worke, if a man be without light he can neither defend himself nor offend an enemy; he that would make use of Christs light must be armed with his doctrine; he that would

infer (<HI>say they</HI>) a plea for our selves against the unjust accusations of the Qua: who use to charge publick preachers with denying the light within each man, whereas such light is not at all denyed by them; each person is to make use of the <HI>light within,</HI> that he do not rebell against the light, a mans own conscience is a Law to him, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>[<HI>This and much more do these men, when they are pleased to begin of themselves confesse to the excellent usefullnesse and sing out to the praise of the light of God with|in each man, but if the Qua: fall in with them in the same work, and commend the same light (for tis no other but that of Christ the Qua: cry up) in the same words with the Priests, then in enmity against the Qua, they set themselves to cry it down with as much indignation and detestation, as they cryed it up with approbation and high commendation before: Then</HI> (to go round again) <HI>they sing a new song in contempt of it, to the Time that hereunder followeth, inveighing most heavily and bitterly against the Quak: for this businesse of warning men to take heed to the Light within, to that of God in their consciences, calling both it and them no lesse then all to nought: witnesse their clamours against the Qua: for this very thing in</HI> Baxt.

<Q><HI>Yea so blasphemously seeme they to speak in the same page of the light within which the Qua. follow and call to, which is no other then that of God in men that convinces them of sin as to intimate that men may, as the Quakers say they do,</HI> follow the light within them, and yet their practice be of the Devill [<HI>The Prince and Ruler only of the darknesse in men</HI>] and not from Gods Spirit, yea (<HI>say they there</HI>) if following the dictates of a mans own Conscience (i.e. <HI>the leadings of the light in it</HI>) could warrant his actions the most horrid acts of Idolaters, Papists, Pagans, Mahometans, Fanaticks, i. e. <HI>mad men</HI> should be free from censure and controul.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Thus to their own shame confusion, and self contradiction who one while speak well of it, they speake abominably of the light within, as if all the wickednesse that is in the world came to passe by following the light within the conscience, the going away from which into mans own vain imaginations and vile inventions into the dark, for not taking heed to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ouncell of God, i. e. his light in the heart, is the only cause of all abomination, without which light shining, and mens loving the darknesse and e|vill deeds, which it condemns more then it, there could be neither sin, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hrist sayes, nor condemnation,</HI> Iohn 3.19.

<P><HI>As</HI> (to go round again) <HI>to their own confutation themselves intimate in the very next words, p. 41, 42. which are thus.</HI>
<Q>If a man do that which he thinks to be evill, [<HI>that is by the lights dictating it so to be in his own Conscience, as they hinted just before</HI>] though it were good and lawfull in it selfe, it would be sin to him, yea that man that doth good against his conscience is hut an hy|pocrite in so doing, though the thing in if self be right and good: When a man doth evill, which his conscience tells him is so, he commits a sin of the highest degree, as to him that knowes to do good, and doth it not, to him it is sin, Iam. 4.7. That is, sin in an high degree, hence great horrour of spi|rit hath attended them that have omitted good, which their conscience told them they should do, and much more horrour in them that have done evill against their conscience, as in the case of <HI>Iudas, Spira</HI> and other in|stances

<Q>And therefore (<HI>say they</HI>) if the <HI>Qua</HI>: intended no more then this, by bidding men look to the light within them [<HI>And no more then that do we intend, God knows, though the blind Guides, who can't see Wood for Trees, hating us, are minded to make men mistake us, as miserably as themselves mistake us</HI>] that men should take heed that they omitted not the good their own consciences told them they ought to do, and that they did not the evill their consciences judged to be so, we should accept of their warn|ing.

<Q>So, when your conscience is rightly infor|med, to follow it, and when it goes wrong [<HI>As it never does, say I, but when it goes from its guide the light</HI>] yet to suspend the act which it condemns [<HI>Till by the light it come to approve of what it ignorantly condemned</HI>] if you desire peace [<HI>It seemes then by these men, as well as the</HI> Qua: <HI>doctrine, that peace is no where to be had but in walking according to the light in the Conscience</HI>] there will (<HI>say they</HI>) be no plea to acquit him before God, or to quiet his own spirit, who proceeds to act according to the light in his own conscience: And a sin a|gainst the light of nature [<HI>So they stile that voyce of God in the conscience still</HI>] is so much the more damnable in that it is against the most irrefragable evi|dence [<HI>Mark how they somtimes yield the light in the conscience of all to be a far clearer evidence then that of the letter it self, and more dangerous to resist, in refe|rence to which they somtimes (to go round again call the light within, but obscure, meer darknesse and blindnesse, and not so dangerous nor damnable to resist, but rather dangerous, yea no lesse then damnable to follow</HI>] He that doubteth (<HI>say they with Paul</HI>) is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith, for whatever is "not of faith is sin (<HI>Mark how themselves affirme with Paul and us, that faith, without which nothing is pleasing to God, out of which all that's done is damning, to be a faith in that light of Christ, which is in the conscience.</HI></Q> <HI>Wo be to him (cry they as we also do) who condemns himself in what he allowes, and contrariwise, say we and</HI> Paul, <HI>and consequently themselves, happy is he (and he only) who is not con|demned in himself (that is by the light in his own conscience) in what he allowes.</HI></P>
