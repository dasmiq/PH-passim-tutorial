<HEAD>To the READER.</HEAD>
<P>_VOuchsafe, good Rea|der,
in a word or two
to vnderstand the oc|casion
of bringing this
<HI>MEDITATION</HI> to the
Presse, that was pur|posed
onely for the Pulpit: the rather
for that it commeth not from the Au|thors
owne hand, who would no doubt
more exactly haue polished it, could
hee haue beene perswaded to publish
it himselfe. But hee, out of his mode|stie
(as hee deliuered it, not like a
<PB REF="4">
Scholler his Lesson learned without
Booke, nor brought with him any
intent to haue it further made pub|li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e,
so) could not be induced (though
instantly laboured both by my selfe
and many others, desiring further
fruit of so learned and religious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
Labour) eyther to publish it himselfe,
or to haue any hand at all in the pub|lishing
of it.</P>
<P>Howbeit at length, vpon extreame
importunitie (rather to preuent the
wrong that by imperfect Copies prin|ted
he might otherwise sustaine, then
to satisfie such as were earnest sutors
to him for the same) hee was with
much adoe drawne before his depar|ture
from the Citie, to deliuer his
Notes to a friend, (with reference of
the whole businesse, to the iudgement
and discretion of others, to deale in,
and dispose of as they should deeme
sit,) who being present at the speaking
of it, with the Authors Notes, and
<PB REF="4">
his owne helpes, hath done his endea|uour
to penne it as neare as he could,
to that which by the Author himselfe
was then deliuered. Which though it
be not altogether <HI>verbatim</HI> the same,
yet it is hoped that there is not any
thing materiall wanting, that the di|ligent
hearer shall desire: besides that
hee shall finde some things ouer and
aboue, that straits of Time, and default
of Memory were then a meanes to
keepe backe.</P>
<P>If any aske, what needed such im|portunitie
in this businesse, there be|ing
already so many Sermons abroad,
that euen Printers themselues com|plaine,
that the Presse is oppressed
with them? I answere: True it is,
that there are Sermons indeede a|broad
by some more then enough;
but yet not enough (I dare say it)
such as this is, that deale so pit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ily,
so effectually, in points of practise
so necessary, so ordinary, as this
<PB REF="5">
doth; wherein Learning and Pie|tie,
delightfull manner of handling,
together with profitable and vsefull
matter, so concurre, that if it please
not any, they are those alone, whose
prophane palates can relish nothing
that sauoureth of grace, though ne|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">er
so delightfull otherwise: if it
profit not any, it is to be feared
they are such, whose corrupt Con|sciences
are growne wel-neare irre|couerable,
if not wholy incurable.</P>
<P>But I am lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">th to be long, where
the worke it selfe is not. This lit|tle
be spoken rather in way of A|pologie
for my selfe and such others
as vrged the publishing of it, then
in commendation of the Worke, which
in the very reading of it, to any iu|dicious,
ingenious, and religious,
will sufficiently commend it selfe.
For my selfe, considering the gene|rall
approbation giuen it by all sorts
that heard it, together with the ear|nest
<PB REF="5">
suites of many others, so in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tant|ly
desiring it vpon their reports,
and finding vpon view and serueigh
the thing it selfe fully to answere
both the reports of the one, and the
desires of the other, I was right
willing and ready (as hee speaketh
in <HI>Plato)</HI> though one barren hither|to
in this kinde my selfe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Socrates apud Plat. in Theaet.</NOTE> to performe
some Midwiue-like office to another,
for the further enlargement of so
generally blessed, and so deseruedly
desired a birth. Wherein if thou shalt
chance to finde any defects, consider
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ut (I pray thee) how hard a thing
it is for another (though not vn|skilfull)
to perfect a worke that some
curious Artist hath left vnfinished.</P>
<P>And so wishing onely, that it may
through Gods gracious assistance, ey|ther
worke into, or increase in thee
a good Conscience, and the comfort
thereof; I leaue the Worke to thy per|vsall,
and it to his blessing, whose
<PB REF="6">
gift a good Conscience is, and with
whom, beside the present comfort of
it heere, is a plentifull reward reser|ued
for it else-where.</P>

<Q>For wee are assured, that wee

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_I Will vse no other Pre|face,
but the short one
before my Text; and
that not as a Preface,
but in way of earnest suite, <HI>Pray
for mee:</HI> For I desire this day, in
treating of a GOOD CONSCIENCE,
both so my selfe to keepe and dis|charge
one, and so to speake home
to yours, that the <HI>dead Consciences</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="7">
may heare the voyce of God in my
Text, &amp; be quickened, the <HI>secure</HI>
ones awakened, the <HI>troubled</HI> ones
comforted, the <HI>tender</HI> confirmed,
the <HI>good</HI> bettered, and <HI>all</HI> receiue
some light and life: that wee may
all depart hence in the peace of a
<HI>Good conscience, assured</HI> (with our
Apostle) <HI>that we haue a good one, de|siring
in all things to walke honestly.</HI></P>
<P>This worke, God witnessing to
my Conscience, I much desire to
doe; and in so doing, I know I
desire a worthy worke: A worke
so highly and peculiarly needfull
for these times, that a sharpe Seer
of them, was often heard to pray,
that God would stirre vp some to
write and preach of this Argu|ment:
and another to <HI>Augustines</HI>
wish, <HI>That hee might heare</HI> Paul
<HI>preach,</HI> addeth his owne; <HI>That the
Text and Theame might be</HI> CON|SCIENCE:
they both saw it gas|ping,
drawing on, and dying; and
<PB N="3" REF="7">
therefore desired that some life
might be put into and kept in it,
before it should be vtterly ouer|whelmed
in death and darknesse.</P>
<P>The time indeede was, in the
beginning of Time, when <HI>Adam</HI>
by his first Sinne brought death
vpon his Soule, and caused it to
raigne ouer all the powers of it,
that this Facultie had most life left
in it, like <HI>Iobs</HI> Messengers, to tell
newes of the great losse.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scintilla reliq. rect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> rat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">is. <HI>Lips.</HI></NOTE> This lit|tle
sparke was left fresh, to shew
what great light had beene extin|guisht;
but now this also through
affected blindnesse and wilfull ma|lice,
is so smoothered and suffoca|ted,
through a daily custome of
sinning, the eyes of it so pecked
out, the mouth so stopped, the
very heart of it so wounded and
quelled, that (as the world iust|ly
complaynes) it is dead long
since; yea, long since buryed in
the graue of habituall sinning,
<PB N="4" REF="8">
with the stone of hardnesse rou|led
vpon it; that, as <HI>Mary</HI> said of
<HI>Lazarus,</HI> the very name of it is
growne vnsauoury, odious, and
I feare ridiculous in the eares of
many. Is it not then high time
for the Lord to worke? and for vs
to see if by crying aloud (as <HI>Elias</HI>
said of the dead Idoll) wee may
fetch life againe into it, which
is the very life of our spirituall
life, and soule of our soule?</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2"> The time is now come vpon vs,
wherein men affect and desire
good Names, Estates, Wiues,
Houses, good Cloathes, good eue|ry

with meane and vile Consciences,
which ought to be the chiefe and
onely good: Wherein men loue
to exercise and shew, in Preach|ing,
in Hearing, in Trading, and
all manner of conuersing, their
Memorie, their skill and cunning,
and al other their <HI>good parts,</HI> as they
<PB N="5" REF="8">
call them, neglecting this which
is the WHOLE of a Man; and
despising <HI>Pauls</HI> Exercise, and <HI>Pauls</HI>
Policie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 24. 16. and 33.</NOTE> <HI>To haue a good Conscience
before God and Man:</HI> Wherein
men loue preaching indeede and
knowledge, but not wholsome do|ctrine;
Preaching to the Consci|ence
and knowledge of them|selues,
which makes this Pulpit
and Church-yard full of Polemi|call
and Schoole-diuinitie; while
the plaine, practicall, and asketi|call
part lyeth vntilled and vnre|garded:
which maketh Citie and
Country full of Craft and Cun|ning,
but voyd and destitute, not
onely of the power but shew of
Conscience. All which maketh
me to chuse rather with the Apo|stle
to speake fiue words to the

said of Lawes; one is yet wanting
for the practising of all the rest.
Now Conscience is the spring of
Practise, and the Wheele that
must set all the rest on going: Is
it not high time to speake to Con|science,
that wee be no longer

<P><MILESTONE N="3"> The time is now approaching,
as wee may easily discerne, if wee

defiance, which he hangs out al|most
in euery Epistle; and if wee

the List, this Epistle, as this Tri|umph,
is his: And worthily indeed

which the whole world compa|red

<PB N="9" REF="10">
will be found as light as drosse

For mine owne part, when I view
this triumph, and the Apostle so
frequently and so confidently v|sing

affected therewithall. The world
hath many stately sights, glorious
obiects, as namely strong Towers,

changes, all the fore-mentioned
are in mine eies, but stately bables,

No: It was but for manners sake

<P>For the Nature of it. Things
that are neerest, and most neerely
concerne vs, are commonly far|thest
off our knowledge and re|spect.
As God, that is in vs and
neere vnto vs; our owne faces and
visages are hardliest knowne, hard|liest
remembred. Som fooles doubt
whether there be such a thing in
them, yea or no. <HI>Origen</HI> thought it
<PB N="14" REF="13">
a Spirit or <HI>Genius,</HI> associated to our
soules, to guide and tutour them:
but this is like some of his other
conceits. The carnal Atheist thinks
it a melancholy humour of the bo|dy,
and so thinkes all the checks
thereof to be effects of Humour.
The Schoole men somewhat acu|ter,
thought it, some, an habite,
some, an act of the soule. The lat|ter
Diuines, a faculty of the intel|lectuall
part: but the trueth is, it's
no such In-mate, no such Guest of
the soule, but an in-bred faculty of
it: <HI>A noble and diuine power, plan|te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
of God in the soule, working vpon
it selfe by reflection:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> Or thus. <HI>The

<P>A <HI>facultie</HI> I call it, because it pro|duceth
acts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hugo <HI>&amp;</HI> Ber|n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">us.</NOTE> and is not got &amp; lost as
habits are, but is inseperable from
the soule, immoueable from the

are, which is <HI>Thomas</HI> his chiefe rea|son

<PB N="15" REF="13">
<HI>quia deponi potest;</HI> the cleane contra|rie

<P>A noble faculty I call it, because
so admirably strange in the reci|procall
working of it. The eye of
man sees not it selfe but by the
helpe of a looking-glasse: neither
hath any creature in this world this
priuiledge and property besides
the soule of man. I giue it roome,
and place it in the whole soule, and
thrust it not, as some haue done,
like a Spider, into some corner of it,
as if it were a part of a part; where|as
the operation and power of it
is circumscribed in no narrower
bounds then the soule it selfe, and
therefore the Hebrewes more apt|ly
call it <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Heart</HI> or <HI>Soule,</HI> and the

soule it selfe is chiefly seated in the
head, and there performeth the
chiefe actions of Reason, Discourse
and Sence, yet is in all and euery
part of the body, and in them
performeth, baser and meaner of|fices
of Nourishment and Moti|on:
right so the Conscience kee|peth
a compleat Court in the
whole Soule, commonly called
<HI>Forum Conscienciae.</HI></P>
<P>In the Vnderstanding part it is
a Iudge, determining and prescri|bing,
absoluing &amp; condemning <HI>de iure.</HI>
In the memory, it is a Register,
a Recorder, and witnesse, testify|ing
<HI>de Facto.</HI> In the Will and Affe|ctions,
a Iayler and Executioner,
punishing and rewarding. Say wee
<PB N="17" REF="14">
not in common vse of Speech,
which is the Emperour of Words,
My Conscience tels mee I did or
did not such a thing, which is an
Action of the Memory? My Con|science
bids mee doe, or forbids

but an Action of the Will: It
smites mee, it checkes mee, it com|forts,
or it torments mee: what
are these but Actions of the Af|fections
recoyling vpon the Soule?
But if any list to contend about
these subtilties, <HI>Conscience</HI> tells
them, it hath no such custome.
<HI>Conscience</HI> falsely so called, delight|eth
to languish about Questions
not tending to Edification; Let
vs rather turne our eyes, to be|hold
and wonder at the Diuine
royalties and endowments of it,
it being in man the principall part
of GODS Image, and that by
which Man resembleth most the
<HI>Autarchie</HI> and selfe-sufficiencie of
<PB N="18" REF="15">
GOD, which I graunt is proper
to his Infinitenesse, to be content
and compleat within it selfe: but
vnder him, and with his leaue
and loue, this Facultie makes man
selfe-sufficient and independant of
other Creatures; like vnto those
selfe-mouing Engins, which haue
their Principle of Motion within
themselues. Thus, <HI>Adam</HI> when hee
was alone, was not yet alone &amp; de|solate,
but might conuerse with this
his Conscience, as well as with a

What then is a good Consci|ence?
That which speakes Peace
with Gods allowance, which is a
Messenger of good things between

God: It lyes in the lawfull peace
of it, and not in integritie and free|dome

then my Conscience. If any Con|science
say to any man, hee hath
no sinne, it lyes in the throate, and
is a Lyer. <HI>Adam</HI> onely had such
a Paradise, such a good Consci|ence,
walking with God, without
sinne, without feare, in the state
of Innocencie. There is but one
way now to come to it: our peace&punc;
is now to be had by Mediation and
Reconciliation; being iustified by
Christs bloud wee haue this peace.
In stead of many, marke one re|markable
place of Scripture for
<PB N="32" REF="22">
this purpose. If you aske what
makes a good Conscience, there is
but one thing in the world will
make it, <HI>Hebr. 9. 14. The bloud of
Christ once offered by his eternall Spi|rit,
without fault, purgeth our Consci|ences
from dead workes.</HI> Yea, so ad|mirable
is the force of this bloud,
that it leaues no more conscience
of Sinne within it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 10. 2.</NOTE> This Lambe
takes them away, and carries them
out of Gods remembrance into
the Wildernesse of Obliuion. If
thy Conscience rage as the Sea,
Christ cast into it, as <HI>Ionas,</HI> whists
all the waues of it. If the Law make
it as Mount <HI>Sinay,</HI> couered with
darknesse, the Gospell calmes and
lightens it presently. If tossed as
the Ship where the Disciples say|led
in the night, hee rebukes the
Windes, and they are still: if the
Diuels rend and rage in it, he casts
them out presently.</P>
<P>The Iaylor came in trembling,
<PB N="33" REF="22">
ready to fordoe himselfe, <HI>Beleeue
in Christ,</HI> sent him out leaping and
reioycing. It's strange how freely,
effectually, and speedily hee quiets
all. Oh all ill Consciences, heare
and beleeue; this is the honour,
royalty, and peculiar dignitie of
Christs bloud, to pacifie and make
good our Consciences! I doe not
so much admire at all his mira|culous
healings of Diseases, Le|pries,
Blindnesse, and Lamenesse,
Daemoniackes of all sorts, as I
doe at his gracious and sodaine
quietting of the Conscience of
<HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> of <HI>Zacheus,</HI> of
<HI>Paul;</HI> and so the like vertue this
bloud hath still, to day and ye|sterday
the same. Nothing else in
the world hath this vertue saue
his bloud: all other merriments
haue no more power to quiet
Conscience, then Holy-water and
Charmes to coniure the Diuell.</P>
<P>I finde in a French Comedie
<PB N="34" REF="23">
one brought in as troubled in
Conscience for sinne, and he runs
vp and downe like a Hart with
an Arrow in the side, for reme|die,
hee buyes a Pardon, runnes
to Shrift, whips himselfe, goes on
Pilgrimages; and all this while, like
an Aguish man that drinkes water,
or leapes into a Poole, his disease
increaseth; then fals hee to seeke
merry company, to see if hee can
play away his trouble; but like
<HI>Sauls</HI> ill spirit, it returnes with grea|ter
violence, &amp; brings seauen worse
with it to torment. In the end hee
findes Christ, or rather is found of
Christ, and so findes peace, &amp; this is
the good Conscience we speake of,
to which being in Christ, there is no
Condemnation, no Accusation.
Wouldst thou purchase a good

this is approued, thus <HI>Paul</HI> got his.
Yea, but is this all? Is it so cheape

a <HI>Requiem</HI> to our Soules, lay the

<P>Let me not daube your Consci|ences

Faith as it pacifieth, so it purifieth
Conscience. Christ purgeth our
consciences to serue the liuing <HI>God,</HI>
and after all his cures, bids the hea|led
<PB N="36" REF="24">
goe away and walke after the
Spirit, and sin no more. There are

had blasphemed or done any vil|lany,
he would pull it off and kisse
it, and so sinne ouer and ouer a|gaine;
like our common Swearers,
that crye God mercy, and aske him
leaue to abuse his Name againe,
and that wittingly and willingly.</P>
<P>These and such like, let their
Consciences speake peace to them,
as the Fryer in <HI>Stephan&punc;</HI> absolued a

a cloak of liberty. I haue heard that
the Pope hath sold a Pardon for a

If he forgiue that which is past, hee

I haue shewed how you may get

one. Here are foure Elements or
humors, which well compounded

or faile in a iust measure or

defectiue and sicke.</P>
<P>The first,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> is that which must be
the first in euery good action, that
is, the <HI>Will,</HI> that the bent &amp; inclina|tion
of that be set right. I would the
word had been plainly translated
as it is in other places, <HI>verbatim, wil|ling:</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="26">
It implyes first; that hee that
hath a good Conscience, doth
not onely doe well, but wills to

forcedly, or out of externall and
si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ter motions, but from an in|ternall
principle, a sanctified and
rectified will, which God accepts
for the deede, and aboue the deed.
Secondly, that he doth not onely
wish and faintly desire, which
Translation may flatter an hypo|crite
that hath some sluggish lusts
and some sodaine good pangs
and moodes, and such as for the
time little differ in sicknesse and
starts from a regenerate will: but
the word notes a strong and setled
resolution, a constant purpose, and
such as produceth endeuour. Hee
th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t will be rich, pierceth himselfe
through with many sorrowes,
where the same word is vsed; I
graunt it is <HI>Carnificina,</HI> a racke to
a good Conscience, to say, It must
<PB N="41" REF="26">
alwaies doe well; and contrarily,
it's a true ground of comfort, to
say, that a will and purpose is suf|ficient
testimonie and approofe of
a good one: but then it must be
meant, not euery languishing and

it <HI>vltimata voluntate.</HI> There
are none so wicked, but at some
times would be good, and leaue
<PB N="42" REF="27">
sinne; but these dispositions breed
imperfect Essayes and profers, ri|pen
not, hold not, discerne not
the name of Will. Corrupt flesh

Sanctified Will may be crossed,

the more stiffe and steady this Will

<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> this Will must extend

whatsoeuer is done for Gods sake

hates all the rest. The rich and

if but one dead Flye be suf|fered,
I say not, if one Flye of
Infirmitie light in it, against
the will fore-mentioned, but if
with our will it lye, and dye, and

many things and stickest at one:
Foolish <HI>Ananiah,</HI> that spilst and
losest all thy cost with a small re|seruation.
Foolish hypocrite, why
takest thou paines to climbe so
high on the hill of Piety, and yet
for one step of iniustice to thy
neighbour, ascends not into Gods
Mountaine, though thou commest
often into Gods Tabernacle. Thou

<PB N="45" REF="28">
short of this <HI>All things,</HI> that thou
forgettest that which should be

Vniuersall and Catholicke obedi|ence,
is the best distinguishing
Touchstone of trueth and false|hood,
of good &amp; bad Consciences.
This Vniuersality must also ex|tend
to great and small duties. I
say Vniuersality, not equality: A

to please God in the great Com|mandements,
as Christ cals them,
and then in euery complement, in

<P>Thirdly, that they be humble

God open the Conscience to heare

the last day, when all these sha|dowes
shall flye away, this sub|stance
shall abide. A good Wife is
a good thing, but <HI>Sarah</HI> must part
with <HI>Abraham;</HI> and these relations
shall cease in Heauen, but a good
Conscience, attended with good
workes, shall follow: and the better
<PB N="68" REF="40">
it hath beene here, the better in de|gree
it shall be there, the wider en|trance
and entertainment it shall
finde there. When all Bookes shall
perish, and Heauen melt like a
Parchment scrole, this Booke shall
be of vse; when all Diuels and dam|ned
shall tremble, and wish the hils
to couer them, this shall lift vp thy
head, for thy redemption approch|eth:
when neither friends, nor a full
purse shall pleade, nor the wicked
stand vpright in iudgement, then,
then, well-fare a good Conscience;
then shal conscience haue it mouth
opened, tongue vntied, &amp; God will
bid it speake. Happy hee then that
hath an excusing one, miserable he
that hath it an accusing aduersary.</P>
<P>Yet still further: Faith and Hope
are excellent things here in this
valley; these shall cease, but Con|science
abides. A good one was a
petty heauen vpon earth, a mount
<HI>Tabor,</HI> a glimpse of glory here: a bad
<PB N="69" REF="40">
one was a Hell, a Purgatory, or
Limbo, at the least, tasting of the
flashes and smoak of hel: but here|after
how intollerable shall be the
horror of the one, and how incon|cei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">eable
the ioyes of the other.
Without this worm that dies not,
hell should not be hel; without this
continual Feast, heauen should not
be heauen. Next the happy vision
of God shall be the company of a
good Conscience, and next to that

not trust in the shaddow of siluer

Goe home with them this day, I

<P>If thou meetest with Simonai|call

<P>I haue not, as <HI>Ezechiel,</HI> a Map

Apes-toyes.</P>
<P>As for the Players, and sesters,

which being as Guardiants and Tutors of
the rest, should either preuent or reforme
their aberrations. And herein miserable
is the condition of these two opticke pee|ces,
that they are more subiect, and that
to more distempers then other inferiour
parts: yet heerein more, that being hurt,
they are more impatient of cure; not only
of searching acrimonous waters (which
yet oft are needefull) but shie of the most
soft and lawny touches: but most of all in
this, that being once extinct, they leaue a
voyd darkenesse to the whole body, expo|sing
it to the pits of destruction. As ex|ceeding
great on the other hand, is the
happines, honor &amp; vse of them, if cleere
and single. For this our Nationall body,
it will little boot either to applaude the
one, or to bewaile the other: I rather wish
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nd looke about mee for some eye-salue,
which may helpe to descry and redresse, if
any thing be amisse. And behold heere
(Right Honourable) a confection promi|sing
something thereto: It was prescribed
first by <HI>Iethro,</HI> whom <HI>Moses</HI> calls the
<PB REF="51">
<HI>eyes of Israel,</HI> Num. 10. 31. And newly
compounded by an Oculist, of whom as I
may not, so I need not say any thing at all.
Next vnder the sacred Fountaine of
light (the light of our Israel) I worthily
accompt your Lordship most sufficient in
law to accept, to make vse, to iudge, to pa|tronize
it. The subiect of the book is the
principall obiect of your Office, to elect,
direct and correct inferiour Magistracy.
To which purposes, Nature, Literature
and Grace haue inabled you, that if you
should faile the worlds expectation, they
will hardly trust any other in hast. Many
in rising haue followed the stirrop, pam|pered
and letting honor not standing the
ground, but once seated haue done re|nownedly.
But your Lordship had neuer
any other graces them your birth and de|sert;
to which, hereditary dignity hath
so gently tendred it selfe, that you haue
not let fal your name of religion in getting
vp. Therefore now you are in the top of
honour, all that know you looke you will
be exactly honourable. For my part,
<PB REF="52">
bounden to your Lordship for a fauour
formerly receiued, greater then your Ho|nour
knowes of, or I can expresse: I shall
leaue <HI>Iethro</HI> to be your Montoir, and my

who hath made you a Iudge of conscience,
that he would make you continue a con|scionable
Iudge, improouing your place
&amp; abilities to the best aduantage belong|ing
to it, the furtherance of your recko|ning
at the last day.</P>

that neuer sit on the Bench
but for fashion: Constables that are

they will be no pragmatical fellowes,

Is there no mean between busi|bodies
and tell-clockes, between <HI>fac|totum</HI>
and <HI>fay't neant.</HI></P>
<P>From this neglect comes that <MILESTONE N="5">
wrong and iniury to the Assises, that
such petty causes, tribling actions and
complaints trouble these graue and
reuerend personages, which a meane
Yeo man were Iudge fit enough to
end in a chaire at home: when the

and iudge of a curtesie made out of

such like bawble-trespasses which I

not be troubled with them.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="6"> Then indeed would that follow,
which <HI>Iethro</HI> assures <HI>Moses</HI> of in the

<P>An admirable emolument of Ma|gistracy
<MILESTONE N="1"> &amp; sufficient reward of all the
paines of it: that they and the people
may goe home in peace, sit vnder their
vines and fig-trees, follow their cal|lings,
and that which is the cheefe
Iewell of all, may lead their liues in al
godlines and honesty. That the gold,
<PB N="67" REF="85">
blew &amp; purple silke might shine and
glister within the Tabernacle, the out
side was couered with red skins and
goats haire, such a shelter is Magistra|cy
to Gods Church and Religion.
<HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> was a great tree, &amp;
euery particular Magistrate a little one
vnder whose boughs people build &amp;
sing, &amp; bring vp their young ones in
religious nurture, euen foster fathers

the reading, as a iust Comme~tary vp|on
this poynt, setting foorth the feli|city,
quietnesse, plenty, vertue and
piety of iust gouernours, as are hiding
places from the winde, and refuges
from the tempest, riuers of waters to
dry places, and as raine to the new
mowen grasse, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Such also were the times enioyed <MILESTONE N="2">
by the Church vnder <HI>Constantine,</HI> de|ciphered
as I take it, <HI>Reu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">la.</HI> 8. when
<PB N="68" REF="86">
there was silence in the heauen about
halfe an houre, the golden vialls fil|led
with sweet odors, the prayers of
the Saints ascending as a pillar of
smoke vp to heauen.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3"> Of these times see Panegyricall
Sermo~s, and Encomiasticall discour|ses
storied of old, and one of them at
large recorded by <HI>Eusebius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Euseb. lib. 10</NOTE> which
whole booke is nothing but an <HI>Elogi|um</HI>
of those peaceable dayes, wherin
the Church was edified &amp; multiplied.
The Common-wealth being to the
Church, as the Elme to the Vine, or as
the garden to the Bees; the flourish|ing
of the one, the thriuing of the o|ther;
and the disturbance of the one;
the disquiet of the other.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="4"> How can men either attend Gods
seruice or their owne worke, when
they are molested at home with drun|kards,
barretors, quarrelous persons,
when hurried vp to <HI>London</HI> with suits.
As I haue knowne a Constable mole|sted
with fiue or six actions, for an act
<PB N="69" REF="86">
o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">stice, in punishing vice according

of spirit do men groa~e vnder delayed
and peruerted Iustice, when it is tur|ned
into Hemlocke, and turnes them
out of their wits, some of them swou|ning
at the sight of their orders, as I
haue heard from credible eye-witnes|ses,
others ready to destroy them|selues,
their aduersaries, yea &amp; some|time
their Iudges.</P>
<P>Oh the benefit of good Magistrats,<MILESTONE N="5">
It is an vnknowne good, as the Coun|try-man
in an ancient Poet, when he
had met withall, feelingly cries out,
that hee had found that <HI>summum bo|num,</HI>
which the Philosophers so much
sought after, he now enioying more
sweetnes of little, then of great reue|nues
in troublous times. Surely, we
Christians ought to prize it as the
meane of our greatest good, of our
peaceable frequenting of our Chur|ches,
and our seruing of God. Mar|chants
make a higher vse, &amp; are more

so should we Christians the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
