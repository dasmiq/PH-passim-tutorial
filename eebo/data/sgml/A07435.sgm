For if the cutting of, manglyng or takynge awaye of halfe the sacra|me~t from the people of god, is no vnfrutefull worke of darknes and such a synne, as none other in a ma+ner is to be compared wyth it: I ca~+not tell what we should cal works of darkenes or what we shold na~e synne. Thys is moste sure, welbe|loued,

There maye aryse ma+ny pernycyous opynions touching that other parte, whyche is leafte: woulde ye therfore take it awaye cleane? how muche rather oughte we to take hede, that we doe in no wyse swarue from the institucyon of Chryste, nor preache otherwyse

<SPEAKER>Priest.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not vnknowen vnto you, if at least ye haue red the scriptures through+ly, that the commaundementes of god are deuyded into .2. kyndes. Some of them are fyrme and sta|ble for euer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The 5. ob|iection.</NOTE> so that they can or mai neuer be chaunged or altered: and these are called Morall preceptes. The other perteyne to externe and outwarde thynges, as to cerimo|nyes and sacramentes, and these
<PB REF="14">
be not so necessarye, but that they may, for the necessite of the place and time, be chau~ged and altered. Therfore the church, in takinge a|waye the one parte of the sacra|mente from the laye people, hath not done amysse, seeing the time doth so require.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prentyse.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where as ye say that the preceptes and commaundements,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ans|wer to it.</NOTE> that appertain to externe and outewarde thyngs, as to ceremonies and sacraments, are not so firme, stable and stro~g, but that they maye, vpon a iuste occasyo~, be chaunged and altered: S. Ciprian in his Epistell contra Aquarios,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ciprianus li. 2. episto. epi. 3. co~tra Aquarios.</NOTE> is directly agaynst you callynge there the co~maundeme~ts and preceptes of thys sacramente grandia, y^t is to say: greate &amp; not lyghtly to be estemed and taken. Chryste also sayeth, that he shalbe y^e lest in the kyngdome of heauen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 5</NOTE> that breaketh the lest of hys com|maundementes.
<PB REF="14">
And in the forth of Deuteronomy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deute. 4.</NOTE> the lorde hym|selfe speaketh these wordes: nowe harken, O Israel, vnto the ordi|naunces (whereby doubtlesse he vnderstandeth ceremonyes) and lawes, which I teach you for to do them: ye shal put nothing vnto the word which I commaunde you: nether dooe aughte there from. Which onely precept and commau~+dement oughte to beate downe our presumptuousnesse, that we wil not only haue our inuencyons to be had in high estimacion and regarded of all men, but also to be preferred before gods worde. In the xv.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nume. 15.</NOTE> Chapter of the numbers it is wrytten, that the children of Is+rael were commaunded to haue ry+bondes of yelowe sylke vpon the vttermoste gardes of theyr gar|mentes, that they, lokynge vpon
<PB REF="15">
them, myght remember al the com+maundementes of the Lorde, and not seke after their own hearte, or after theyr owne eyes, after the which they went a whoryng. And in the Epistell to the Romans, Paul doeth greatly reproue or re|buke the heathen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Roma. 1.</NOTE> because they wer waxen foolyshe in theyr own ima|gynacyons, and woulde not wor|shyp god, as thei learned to know hym, by hys creatures. Wherfore, sayeth he, they were geuen ouer in to filthy co~cupiscence. And it is no doubt, but that thys manglyng of the Lordes supper doeth apper|tayne to that kynde of transgressi|on or faute.</P>
<P>Notwythstandyng I graunte, that there is a certayne difference in the preceptes and commaunde|mentes of god. For some there be, that we are alwayes bounde and subiecte vnto, as are the morall
<PB REF="15">
commaundementes, or those that the lawe and the prophetes do de|pende vpon, whyche are: to loue god wyth al our heart, with al our strength, wyth all our soule, and our neighboure as our self. Other there bee, that we are not alwayes bounde to folowe, excepte it bee, when the tyme and place &amp; other circumstaunces appointed in the worde of god doe require. For the Hebrewes myght not offer sacry|fices euery where, and at al times, but vpon certayne dayes: and in y^e place, that god had ordayned and appoynted.</P>
<P>On the Sabboth daye they could not alwayes abstayne from outwarde workes, but were fayne other whyles to fyght, as we read in the bokes of the Machabees. A|gayne circumcision coulde not bee ministred afore the eyght day.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gene. 17.</NOTE> In lyke maner, if any man were desy|rous
<PB REF="16">

<P>When it is vsed, it hath a good+ly significacion.

<P>Some there be that graunt, that the wordes were altered and chaunged, but that the fourme and maner, that the Apo|stels did vse, was all one with y^t&punc; that Chryste had prescribed them
<PB REF="20" MS="y">
in his gospel. For (say they) in the name of Iesu Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>In y^e name of Iesu Christ the names of y^e 3. diuine persons ar comprehe~|ded.</P>

<P>And Ireneus in hys. 4. booke co~tra vale~tinianos doeth plainely testifie and witnesse the same, say|ing: in the name of Chryst the thre persons are vnderstanded: for this worde, Chryst, dooeth signifie an|noynted, wherein is shewed both he that annoynteth, he that is an|noynted, and the vnction it selfe: he that is annoynted is the sonne, he that annoynteth is the father, &amp; the vnctio~ is the holi goste.

<P>So may we right wel say, that in this alteracion, which is so sore impugned &amp; spoke~ agaynst in this sacrame~t, nothi~g is take~ away:
<PB REF="21">
in the one parte or kinde the whole is contayned.</P>
<P>For ye knowe righte well, that the body of Chryst, which is geue~ vnto the lay people vnder y^e forme of bread, is not wythout blood, so y^t as in or vnder y^e name of Christe, all three persons, that is to saye, y^e father, the sonne and the holy gost ar vnderstanded, so vnder y^e forme of bread is both the body &amp; bloud contayned.</P>
<P>What haue ye now to say agai~st this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prentyse.</SPEAKER>
<P>I haue to say thys. As for the aunswere that I haue broughte out of Ireneus, I dooe not greatly leane vpon it. For in y^e place of the Actes of the Apostles to baptize in the name of Chryste is to baptize by hys commaunde|ment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What is to baptise in y^e name of Chryst.</NOTE> and according to his wil and institution.</P>
<P>Wherby we mai rather co~clude and gather, that the Apostles dyd
<PB REF="21">
obserue the fourme and maner, y^t Christe had prescribed. Els thei had not baptized in the name of Christ, if they had done otherwise than Christ had commaunded the~, Farthermore it is not to be thoght. that the Apostles, which did with such a diligence and zeale set forth the true religion, dyd caste of the fourme and maner of baptizinge y^t Chryst had ordayned and prescri|bed vnto them.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>Thomas de Aquino.</P>
<P>Why after the schole+men the A|postls bap+tised in the name of Chryste</P></NOTE></P>
<P>Besides all this, when y^e schoole+men (as we reade in Thomas de A+quino) doe consent and agree, that the fourme and maner of baptising hath been in some thing chaunged and altered by the Apostles: they wryte that it was done for a tyme, and that by the dispensinge of the holy goste, and that therefore we ought not to mak of it a perpetual lawe.</P>
<P>For why? It was done to thys
<PB REF="22">
ende, saye they, that the name of Chryst myght be the more spreade abrode.</P>
<P>But this ye dooe not obserue, whe~ ye take away the mistical cup of the communio~ from the people. For, as ye doe it without any dis|pensing of the holy gost, so wyl ye haue your vngodlye and blasphe|mouse decree to contynewe for e|uer.</P>
<P>Agayne the Apostles did not condemne as heretykes those, that would vse the prescribed fourme &amp; maner of baptising. But ye do not only condemne al the laye people, as heretikes, that receaue vnder both kindes, but ye doe also moste cruelly burne them.</P>
<P>And who would not, besides al this, deteste and abhorre thys doc|tryne, which affirmeth, that it lieth in mans power to inuert, turne &amp; chaunge either the mater or words

<P>This is soone said, but not so soone proued master person: for ye must vnder|stande,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ans. to the 9. obiec.</NOTE> that the communion of the body and bloud of Chryste in the sacrament is not y^e work of nature: whatsoeuer is ther deliuered vnto vs, as it is offered vnto vs by or in the wordes of Christes promises, so is it receaued by faith. And in this externe or outwarde things, God doeth most chiefly and most principally require our obedience. The signes and outwarde affictio~ of the ceremonies are thinges tra~|sitory, but the word of God remai+neth for euer: and therfore the sa|cramentes muste be ministred ac|cordynge to the rule of it. Againe:
<PB REF="23">
we receaue so much there, as God hath appointed to geue vnto vs, of whose will we can not be certified but only by hys worde.</P>
<P>But Chryste hath ordayned ii partes of thys sacrament, saying of the one: This is my body, and of y^e other: thys is my blood, meaninge therby, that in the bread being wor+thely receaued, and accordynge to Christes institucion, we are made partakers of his bodye, and in the wine, partakers of his bloode: and hath left vnto vs expresse wordes, for or touchyng these thyngs: ther+fore we must rather trust to hym, than to mans sophistications or subtyll argumentes.</P>
<P>I confesse and graunte that the body of Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christes bodi in hea+uen is not wythout blood.</NOTE> whiche is in hea|uen, is not wythout blood. I doubt not but that they are both ioyned, together in him: I meane, this is my belefe, that in Chrystes natu|ral
<PB REF="24">
body, there is both hys fleshe &amp; bloud ioyned together. But howe shal ye proue that they are bothe ioyntly ioyned together in the sa|crament.</P>
<P>The fayth of the communica~tes doeth in the one part amplexe, em+brace, and take holde vpon the bo|dy of Chryst, as it was hanged and nayled on the crosse, wherwith we are spiritually fed. And the same fayth doeth in the other parte ap|prehende and take holde vpon hys bloud, that was shedde for our sal+uation, and therof we doe spiritu|ally drynke.</P>
<P>The myndes of the faythfull doeth most chefeli runne vpo~ these misteryes of Christes death, when they doe communicate. Therefore we must not now reaso~ how christe body is in heaue~. We folow gods worde, and see or perceaue, that it is not necessary, that those thi~gs
<PB REF="24">
which are naturally ioyned toge|ther, should be ioyntly receaued to+gether:</P>
<P>The humayn and diuine nature are in the person of Chryst ioynt|ly ioyned together, and can in no wyse be separated one from an o|ther: yet ye wil not say, that wher+soeuer the Godhead is there is y^e manhode also: for y^t wer to make y^e body of Chryste infynyte and vn|mesurable, whyche is contrary to the nature of an humayne body.</P>
<P>The sonne of God, in that he is God, is founde to be euery where and filleth al thinges, whiche can not be truely sayed of hys bodye. More ouer al spiritual gyftes are ioyntly ioyned together in the holi+goste, and yet it foloweth not that whosoeuer hath the gift of prophe+cying, hath also y^e gyfte of to~gs: or whoso hath y^e gifte of to~ges, hath
<PB REF="25">
also the gift of prophecying. Seue+rite and mercy are moste ioyntlye ioyned together in God, and yet when any ma~ receaueth euerlasti~g lyfe, he feleth the mercy of God, &amp; not hys extreme rigoure. The same might I say of many other things, which though they be in the~selfes most ioyntly ioyned together, yet are they geuen separatly.</P>

It is most true, that in the firste settinge foorth of Christendome, that is to say, of the Christen religion and gospell, we must beginne at the doctryne. For when a citie, contreye or realme, must be wonne to Chryst, afore we come to baptisme, preaching must be vsed.</P>
<P>Whyche when it is once recea|ued and beeleued, not onelye they, that be of age, are baptised, but al|so they offer their litell ones to bee baptysed.</P>
<P>That therefore, that was gene|rally commau~ded of Christ, ye wil bryng it to a particular baptisynge

The Greke worde is Matheteusantes, which signifieth to make disciples, and to aggregat or gather vnto Chryste, whyche thyng, in them that are of age, is do~ both by doctryne and baptisme, in the yonge children by baptisme on+ly, because they are not yet able to receaue the doctrine.

<P>As touching the first it is to be consydered, that Chryst did eate first the paschall lambe: for his minde and wyl was after y^e abolyshyng of the olde sacraments to institute and ordayne the newe.

<P>Take and drynke all of thys: do thys in the rememberaunce of me: let euery man examine hymselfe, &amp; other lyke.

Causes whi the commu+nion is mi|nistred in y^e mornynge.</NOTE> S. Ci|prian rehearseth the causes, why y^e Lordes supper or communion is ministred in the mornyng: the first is, because the people maye better come together at that houre, tha~ at any other tyme of the day besides: for in the daye time much busines chaunceth, whereby men are pluc|ked away from the diuine seruice. The seconde is, because men ar at that tyme sobre, and haue theyr myndes more apte to receaue and beare awaye Godlye lessons and wholsome doctryne.</P>
<P>The thirde is, because the mor|ning
<PB REF="28">
is a good monument or reme~+beraunce of the Lordes resurrecti+on or rising agayne, which thing is much auaileable to the institucion of thys sacrament.</P>
<P>Moreouer, it is to bee noted, y^t the aunciente fathers, when they obserued and kept any general fa|stinge, beecause they tooke then no meate till nyght, wer wont to haue the Communion in the eueninge: for when they fasted, thei gaue the~+selues al the day long to prayers, to hearyng of sermons, to singinge of Godly Hymmes, and to other lyke Godly exercises.</P>
<P>Aboute the euenyng the communi+on or lords supper was ministred they receued the sacrament, and so eueri ma~ went home to take hys re+paste.</P>
<P>Howbeit in Saint Augustins tyme they were wonte in manye
<PB REF="28">
churches, vpon maundye thirsday to receaue the communion at night that so they myghte the better ex|presse Christes institution and do+ynge: but I fynde that this custo~e was abolyshe and put downe by the sixte counsell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The sixte Counsel. of Co~stant+nople kept in Trullo.</NOTE> that was kepte at Constantinople in Trullo, the Canons of whych counsell are set forth in greke, wherin mentyon is made, of the custome that was the~ vsed in the churches of Affrica. But to bee short, so that y^e whole sa+cramente be ministred, and the in+stitutyon of Chryst kept, we ought not greatly to care for the time, or o+ther like circumstaunces, sythens we haue no expresse commaunde|mente of them.

<SPEAKER>Prentyse.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly master person, I haue mar+ked them wel, and I trust, ye shal say no lesse, by that tyme ye haue heard myne answer.</P>
<P>As for the first argument, that ye haue brought,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ans. to the 16. obiec.</NOTE> saying that Chryste hath some tymes ministred vnder
<PB REF="34">
one kynd, because we read in Luk that his disciples knewe him by y^e breakyng of bread, that verelye is to weake, yea and verye foolyshe also.</P>
<P>For ye shal neuer be able to shewe that the breakynge of bread doeth in that place signifie the holy com|munion, syth that the same maner of speakyng is in y^e holy scriptures applyed verye often tymes to the commaundementes. And it is no meruail, that those disciples knew him by breakyng of bread, or by ta+kyng of commen meate. For syth y^t Christ (as we maye Godly beleue of hym) hadde certayne peculyare thankes geuinge and prayers, he myght easely be knowe~. But grau~t that Chryst did then at that tyme geue one parte of the Sacramente onely: shall it be lawfull for vs to dooe it therefore? He dyd not by y^e
<PB REF="35">
same one onelye doinge abrogate or abolyshe the generall commaun+dement, that he gaue at his supper, and afterwardes was confyrmed by the writinges of the Euange|lystes and of Paul.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 22.</NOTE>God did once commaunde A|braham to sacrifice his sonne: yet he did not by that abolyshe this ge+nerall commaundenlente of hys: thou shalt not kyl.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exo. 20.</NOTE></P>
<P>He did also commaunde once the Israelites to carye awaye the goods of the Egipcians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ex. 3.11.12.</NOTE> howbeit he wil haue neuerthelesse this hys commaundemente to stande styll: Thou shalt not steal.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sinecdoche is a figure, wherby, when part of a thyng is named, y^e whole is vnderstan|ded, &amp; so~e+tymes the whole bei~g named, parte onely is vn+derstanded</NOTE> Moreouer by the breakynge of the breade, the whole supper may be vndersta~ded by a figure, which is called Syn|ecdoche.</P>
<P>And wheras ye blame vs, bee+cause (as ye report of vs) we do of one onely action or doing of Christ

When we flee to the scriptures, by and by ye say that they are obscure and darke, and so appeall to the fa+thers, who, ye saye, doe all stande on your syde, ye runne to the anti|quitie of tyme, wherby ye goe a|boute to mocke awaye al the testi|monyes and autorytes of the scrip|tures.

<P>The first cause, so farre as I do re|member, is leaste the cuppe should be shed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ans. to the 18. obiec.</NOTE> if it shoulde bee ministred uniuersally to all men.</P>
<P>Here dooe I muse and greatly
<PB REF="37">
meruel at Ireneus, Basilius, Am|brose, Nazia~zene and Augustyne, which being such wise and prude~t fathers, did not see these perylles in the sacrament: or if they dyd se them, they dyd not so much esteme them, that they woulde therefore violate the sacramentes, whyche neuerthelesse, they ministred very often.</P>
<P>For these blasphemous priuat masses were not yet then vsed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Priuate masses are here called when no co~+munion is vsed.</NOTE> They did alwayes communicate in the misteries wyth the other, y^e people comming to the communio~ much more often than they do now a dayes.</P>
<P>They did not passe so muche, if part of the mistical cuppe dyd per|chaunce fall on the grounde. In Ciprianus tyme a maide did spue out of the misticall wyne. Thys was the greatest care, that the ho|ly fathers tooke, that they myghte
<PB REF="37">
minister the sacrament to worthye persons.</P>
<P>But ye laboure not to put a|waye from it dogges and swyne, by whom much greater iniurye is done to the bloud of Chryste, than if some droppes of it shoulde bee spilled on the grounde: therefore I would counsayll the ministers, if at lest I were worthy to geue cou~|sel, to take good hede, that none be spilled, and if any chaunceth to be spilled, let them bee sory therfore, and yet it ought not to be exagge|rated, as though it were a thynge irremissible.</P>
<P>Sainct Augustine writeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Augusti.

<P>When there is suche necessite,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ans. to the 20, obiec.</NOTE> that the lawe canne take no place, to suche kynde of menne one parte onelye of the sacrament may be geuen.</P>

<P>For it is god that semeth to haue broughte or cast that man into this necessite, wherby it foloweth, that he doth not wittingly and willing+ly violate the sacrament. So~e there be that make thys answere: if any doe so abhorre wyne, that they can by no meanes awaye with it: suche drinke may be geuen vnto them, as they can wel away with al, so that the sacrament be kept whole, &amp; the wordes of the Lorde fully rehear|ced.</P>

For in so doing they seeme rather to sub|mitte themselues to the inbecillite and weakenesse of theyr brethren, than to violate the sacramente.

Secondely I graunte that Cipry|ans disputacion, wherin he confu|teth the waterlings, is particular, but the argumentes and reasons, that he doeth vse, are vniuersall, y^t is to say: how in the sacramente of the body and bloud of Christ, we ought in no wyse to swarue from Chrystes institucion. Wherevpon I conclude that it is in no wise law+ful, to take away the misticall cup from the communion.</P>

<P>If it be the pleasure of God to bryng me into any trou|ble for hys sonne Iesu Chrystes sake, or for his truethes sake, I am assured that he wil not suffer me to be tempted aboue mi strength, but wyl in the middest of my tempta|tion make awaye, that I maye be a+ble to beare it: that is to saye: thys doe I beleue, that God wil, of his
<PB REF="45">
infinite goodnesse, measure hys crosse accordyng to my strengthe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">God mea|sureth hys crosse accor+ding to our strength</NOTE> Loke what I am able to bear, that wyl hys fatherly and most mercy|full goodnesse laye vpon my shol|ders, if it be expedient for his glo|ry, for the edifying of hys churche and for the saluacion of my soule: and if it be his Godlye pleasure, to encrease hys crosse vpon me, he wyll also encrease my strength. In the meane ceason I know thys to be moste sure, that it is not the way to eschewe trouble, to flee fro~ God or to swarue fro~ his trueth: but rather it is the way and meane to bryng my selfe into a much grea+ter trouble, bothe in thys worlde here, and also in the worlde to come.</P>
<P>And speciallye for thys matter of the sacrament, that now we haue in handlyng: I doubt not, but that God will of hys ryghteous iudge+mente
<PB REF="45">
plage thys wicked worlde wyth great and horrible plagues. For if the Corinthians, that kepte Chrystes holy institucion whole,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 11.</NOTE> were neuerthelesse, bee cause they misused the~selues in the receauing of the sacrament, so sore punyshed wyth syckenesse, newe diseases &amp; pestilences: what oughte they to looke for, at the ryghteous iudge|ment of God, that so blasphemous+ly prophanate hys sacramentes, ta+kyng away moste sacrilegeouslye not only the one halfe of the matter that the sacramentes are made of, but also the very wordes of the in|stitution? Truely all the plagues, that doe dayly chaunce vnto vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">the propha+nacion of y^e sacramente is the chief cause of our plages.</NOTE> as tumulte, sedicion, rebellions, insur+rections, famyne and extreme hun|ger, derth and scarcenesse of al ma|ner of thynges, with innumerable kyndes of newe diseases, that day+ly spryng vp emong vs, oughte to
<PB REF="46">
be imputed to none other thynge, but to thys prophane mutilatyon or manglyng of the sacramente.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Priest.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did not al these plags happen vnto vs, when ye had the sacrament ministred vnder both kyndes? What tumultes and insur+rectyons haue we had in that short tyme, that all thynges were, as ye woulde haue them? What dearth and scarcenesse of victualles haue we had euer since?<NOTE PLACE="marg">The chiefe argumente that y^e pope catholikes vse nowe a daies to dif+fame the gospel and worde of god.</NOTE> Whereunto shal we impute these thynges? Did not besydes all thys all the chiefe au|tors of your religion come to an ill ende? recken Anne Boleyne, Cro~e|wel, the duke of Somerset, y^e duke of Northumberland, and the duke of Suffolke, that I shoulde in the meane ceason passe them ouer, that haue been burnt as most shamefull heretykes.</P>
<P>Therefore yong man, looke bet|ter to your selfe, weigh &amp; consyder

these thinges better in your mind, and returne by tymes, least ye re|pente your selfe at length of thys your sticneckednesse.</P>

<P>I graunte,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Answere.</NOTE> that we haue had tumultes and insurrecty|ons in that shorte tyme, that true re+lygyon was vp: but who wer the authors of them? Were they not a sorte of rebellyous Papystes, that caused the insurrectyon in y^e weast parte of Englande, for to haue put downe true relygyon, and Gods worde?</P>
<P>As for them of Northfolke, it is not vnknowe~ what was y^e cause of their rising.</P>
<P>And no doubte it is but that there were many chyldren of Bel|liall amonge them, that prycked them forewardes: as the deuil is al+wayes busye to sowe sedicion and
<PB REF="47">
to moue mens hartes to rebellion, but most specially, when he seeth, that the world falleth awaye from him, by the preachyng of y^e worde of god.</P>
<P>Then doth he bestirre himself, seekyng all meanes possible to bri~g the gospel into a suspicion or ge|lousye, and to make men to beeleue that it is a sedicious doctryne: that so by that meane he may enioy his possession stil.</P>
<P>As long as the world sitteth in darkenesse and in the shadowe of death, runnyng headlong, for lack of the light of goddes worde, into perdycyon: the deuill is quiete en|oughe, ye shall heare but of few tu+multes.</P>
<P>For why? he is then in peasable possession of the worlde: what ne|deth he to make any thyng adoe: And as for the derth and scarcenes of victualles, y^t we haue had euer
<PB REF="47">
since, whervnto shal we impute y^e same, but to a sort of Cormarands, which vnder the cloke of Goddes worde hyded theyr treaterouse co|uetousnesse? For, thankes bee vnto God, there hath ben always great plentie in thys realme, euer since y^e true reformacion of the churche, of all maner of thinges, that are neces+sary for the sustenaunce of man: so that both victuals and other neces|sary things might haue been good cheape, if it had not been for these caterpillers, whyche would rather suffer theyr corne to be eaten with vermine, and theyr cattel to dye of the rote,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cause of y^e scarce|nes &amp; derth that is now a daies &amp; to whom it ought to be imputed.</NOTE> or sende both corne &amp; cat|tel ouer into straunge contreyes, than let theyr poore neyghboures to haue any thyng at theyr hands, for a reasonable pryce. Thys hath made this derth, and nothing els. Howbeit I doe not denye but that it is a plage of god, that thus in the
<PB REF="48">
middest of plenty, we suffer suche penurie and scarcenesse: but wher|vnto shall we impute it, but to our rebellyous heartes, and diuelish~e stubburnesse, that wold in no wise receaue Gods worde, whe~ it was so plenteously offered vnto vs, but kycked agaynst it, hauynge lieffer to fede stil of the coddes &amp; huskes wyth the swyne, than to eate dein|tye meates in our fathers house?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Had ye not masses said in your priui cham+bers, ye ranke pa|pysts, kept ye not Ido+latry in eue+ry dark cor+ner?
