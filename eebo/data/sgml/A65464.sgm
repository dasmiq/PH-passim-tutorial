<HEAD>To the Honoured Mr. H. D. Head-Master
of the Free-School in D&mdash;,
in the County of D&mdash;.</HEAD>
<P>THE great <HI>Cowley</HI> forgets not to ac|knowledge
his Master's Care and
Kindness while at <HI>Westminster;</HI> nor,
to come nearer, was Mr. <HI>Creech</HI> much tar|dier
in publishing his grateful Resentments
of the same Obligations from Mr. <HI>Curganven.</HI>&mdash;You
may, Sir, justly wonder what makes
me drag in such Names into a Piece where
there is hardly like to be besides, one word
of Earnest, and perhaps not many of Sence:
You may be apt to judge me worthy not
much less Punishment than that Comoedi|an
who stole matter from the Sacred Hi|story
to patch up his <HI>Farce.</HI> But here I
must unavoidably take Refuge at the old
thumb'd Scrap, <HI>Sic parvis componere magna</HI>&mdash;Or,
to be more sincere; this seem'd a pret|ty
way of beginning; I was fond of the
Fancy, and knew not where to get a better.
However, tho' I ha' been bold enough to
make the Similie, I hardly dare be so saw|cy,
<PB REF="3">
I mean o' my side, to apply it; nor,
tho' Mr. <HI>D</HI>&mdash;may be as noble a Field for
<HI>Panegyric</HI> as any, venture to disgrace him
with prefixing here his Name, or my <HI>little
Praises.</HI> 'Tis enough that all who knew me
when under his Tuition, know what a fair
share I enjoy'd of his undeserved Favours;
and that all who know so many famous
Men as have had the happiness of their Edu|cation
there, are satisfy'd 'tis my own fault
I ha'n't made suitable Proficiency to what
might be rationally expected from such an
advantageous Foundation.&mdash;As to my ad|dressing
these to you, though I can have no
full Excuse, yet my Presumption or Vanity
may admit, I hope, some Alleviation. This
is my <HI>first form'd Birth,</HI> of which, tho' ge|nerally
partaking all the Parent's <HI>ill hu|mours,</HI>
the greatest part of the World uses
to be, if not most fond, yet most concern'd;
and no wonder therefore, abstracting from
its Value or Defects, I am willing to pro|vide
for it, and prefer it, But tho' Grati|tude
commanded you should know the Au|thor,
and that exact Respect he is still ob|lig'd
to pay your former goodness; yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
was too conscious of the mean way I testi|fy'd
it in, and the unworthiness of the Ac|knowledgment,
and had too tender a sense o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
your Reputation, to let your name publick|ly
<PB REF="3">
appear here, before I knew what Recep|tion
these <HI>true Trifles</HI> might find in the
World. The most, the best, the all I can
say for 'em, is what I remember many a
fair year past on such a kind of occasion:&mdash;Accept

<HEAD>THE
EPISTLE
TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentle Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the first place, pray take notice this is
addressed only to those that buy the Book,
for such as only borrow't, my good Friend
the <HI>Bookseller</HI> and I will ha' nothing to do with
'em: For is there any Reason or Conscience in't
that he should write so many Letters to me
about the business, and I take so much pains for
him, besides some appurtenances of Money for
Copy, Printing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> only for a meer <HI>How d'ye?</HI>&mdash;In
the next place, since it comes upper|most,
I am to tell ye <HI>bon&acirc; fide,</HI> that is in Eng|lish
in <HI>verbo Sacerdotis,</HI> that all here are my
own <HI>pure Maggots,</HI> the natural Issue of my
Brain-pan, bred and born there, and only there.
<PB REF="4">
&mdash;Nay the <HI>Bookseller</HI> and I would have
you to know, these are no Scraps or Remains
of I know not who; which if you question, or
doubt, you are to be fobb'd off again with a Pri|soners-Basket
of Collections; I do ye to wit you
are egregiously mistaken in the matter, and prove
it by a couple of sturdy arguments. One&mdash;that
never a Subject here was ever treated of,
at least in this Method, by <HI>Man, Woman, or
Sucking Child,</HI> from the beginning of the World
to&mdash;this present writing, and so downwards:
T'other argument, which you 'l find concludes very
strongly&punc; is,&mdash;Because here wants a hundred
and fifty Copper-plates precisely, (curiously en|graven,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI>) which any that's but ordinarily
verst in modern History, knows to be as insepa|rable
a mark of an <HI>omnium gatherum</HI> as the
Cloven foot is of <HI>Mephistophiles.</HI> If you have
therefore the Luck to see one <HI>gaudy picture</HI>
at the beginning, which is even as it pleaseth
Painter, and Printer, set your Heart at rest there,
and hope not for a scrap of one more between&mdash;<HI>Gentle
Reader and Finis.</HI>&mdash;But this is n't
a Quarter of what you and I have to say to
one another: I should be an hard hearted Bruit
of a Father indeed, if I could be so cruel as
to send this <HI>poor Brat of a Book</HI> abroad in|to
the wide World, without speaking so much as
one good Word for't. What may be objected
against it, is either as to the matter, or man|ner
<PB REF="5">
of 't; and here, tho' with Mr. <HI>Rhombus</HI>
I should cut my Cheese into two particles, yet
since my Readers naturally fall into three parts,
I can't help't, to save my Life: They are either
the <HI>Wise,</HI> or <HI>Fools,</HI> who 'tis likely may be
disgruntled at the first&mdash;<HI>or the Trimmers,</HI> a Little o' one with t'other, who may be of|fended
at the Latter.&mdash;Now, <HI>Quo</HI>' the first,&mdash;'Tis
light, vain, frothy, airy,&mdash;here's Time
mispent, and may&mdash;be some pains on Subjects be|low
the Gravity of a Man, at least of a Chri|stian,
to employ himself about. So much for
<HI>Ob: enter Sol.</HI>&mdash;If those Gentlemen will
do me the favour to lend me an handful or two
of <HI>Beard,</HI> and be at the charge of grafting it
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">n, I'll oblige my self to a speedy, and thorough
Reformation in that case. Some time is no
doubt allowable for meer <HI>Recreation,</HI> this is cer|tainly
harmless; I hope nothing will be found here
that may either make me justly blush to own,
or another to read; and I hope they 'l grant this
kind of diversion a little more excusable than
fooling away two or three years, and it may be
as many Reams of Paper, in doleful Dittys of
<HI>Philander</HI> and <HI>Phillis,</HI> which uses to be the ge|neral
work of all that are Prentices to a <HI>Verse-wright</HI>&mdash;They
have, I believe, heard of
the Great St. <HI>Basils Encomium</HI> on a <HI>Pismire,</HI>
as well as the Diversions of many famous Per|sons
on as <HI>Inconsiderable Subjects.</HI> I dare not
<PB REF="5">
before them quote the Authority of the inge|nious
Preface to the <HI>Valentinian,</HI> (tho' hard|ly
one of 'em but must own when young they
have read both Plays and Romances:) But here's
somewhat I some time ago <HI>cabbag'd</HI> from <HI>Os|born,</HI>
that will I think help as well at a dead
lift.&mdash;[<HI>Advice to a Son of Studies</HI>&mdash;pag. 11.
parag. 17.] <Q><HI>The way to Elegance of Stile,
is to employ the Pen upon every Er|rand,
and the more trivial and dry it
is, the more Brains must be allow'd for
Sawce. Thus by checking all ordinary
Invention, your Reason will attain to such
an Habit, as not to dare present you but
with what is excellent.]</HI></Q></P>
<P>Well! If all this won't satisfie, what think
ye of a knocking Argument, <HI>hight-necessity?</HI>
Who knows but my Shoes may want <HI>dearning,</HI>
or my Stockings happen to be a little out at
<HI>Elbows,</HI> (no Miracles in a <HI>Rhimester</HI> let me
tell ye) and in this case a Recruit of as ma|ny
yellow Ones as the <HI>Book-seller</HI> and I can
agree upon, will be no <HI>false Latin.</HI> They may
rejoyn,&mdash;Why not something serious then, and
worthy my own pains, and others perusal? 'Tis
easily answered, That tho' such a design should
suit with my present Years and Inclinations, yet
who would be the <HI>Customers?</HI> Alas, their Par|ty
is but weak and small in the World; which
leads me to the <HI>second Part of my Text.</HI>
<PB REF="6">
&mdash;As concerning <HI>Fools,</HI> the Proverb is,&mdash;<HI>A
Word to the Wise;</HI> but o' the contrary, I
hope to dispatch these more reasonable Gentle|men
a great deal sooner; their Objections sure
can't be very material, nor will their Weapons
make very deep Impressions, tho' <HI>soon shot:</HI>
However, being the greatest, the most conside|rable,
jovial, complaisant, agreeable part of
Mankind, 'twill be no small part of my Inte|rest
to oblige 'em. And why may'n't I have
my chance as well as others? If I take the
same Method by which another has pleas'd 'em:
If I write <HI>silly enough,</HI> why mayn't my Book
sell as well as any Christmas Tales and Won|derments
that has been clapt into <HI>Fist since
Bills were invented?</HI> I'm sure my Verses&mdash;<HI>dribble
down daintily, as Bro.</HI> Bunnyan
<HI>has't,</HI> as well as the best <HI>Sing-song in e're
a Pilgrim's Progress of 'em all.</HI> But since
these are great words, and Comparisons are
odious, I'l make an end of 'em, and only as|sure
those whom it may concern,&mdash;That 'tis all
perfectly new; 'tis all mirth,&mdash;and I know not
what else 'tis recommends <HI>a Rattle</HI> to Chil|dren,
and <HI>Bartlomew&punc;</HI> Fair to <HI>Fools.</HI> But
if any chance to stick somewhere or other on
something that looks like <HI>Reason,</HI> which I'l en|gage
shan't fall out often enough to choak 'em,
why 'tis but taking a small leap, and They 're
safe and sound upon the <HI>Terra firma of Non|sence
<PB REF="6">
agen.</HI>&mdash;But now for the <HI>middle-siz'd
man,</HI> just in the Centre of Gravity, between
wise and fool,&mdash;that cruel Indifferent, which
not a whining Lover in <HI>Chistendom</HI> but shall
tell you, is a thousand times more unsupporta|ble
than flat and plain hating. What's to be
done with this most <HI>unhoopable</HI> Reader? I
doubt he'l make as doleful a clatter among my
<HI>poor Maggots,</HI> as <HI>Lucian</HI>'s <HI>Colossus,</HI> quar|relling
and <HI>hunching</HI> about for <HI>Elbow-room</HI> in
the Parliament of the Gods, who broke holes in
the very Roof of <HI>Olympus</HI> with his Steeple
Crown. This is that dreadful sort of Animal,
as common, and teasty, and mischievous in the
Play-house, as the <HI>Mesquito</HI> in hotter Coun|tries,
or <HI>Gnats</HI> in the <HI>Fenlands.</HI> By this time
I suppose you know what I mean by all this
clutter; neither better nor worse than that sort
of Creature call'd a <HI>Critic:</HI> And he 'tis likely
Tooth and Nayl falls abord the manner of my
work. Right Worshipful. <HI>&mdash;'Tis strain'd,&mdash;af|fected,&mdash;full
of Longe-petites, store of In|congruities,&mdash;Uncorrect,</HI>&mdash;Tedious&mdash;Di|gressions,
long-Comment <HI>run away with the
Text,</HI> &amp;c. If you have any thing more <HI>Mr.
Critic!</HI> pray speak now, or for ever after hold
your peace! No: This some will say is more
than enough, because unanswerable. But soft|ly;
One's Tale's good till another's is told.
Is any thing strain'd or obscure? In such <HI>un|common</HI>
<PB REF="7">
Subjects, so purely out of the Road,
how can the Superstructure be otherwise! Pray
what Author could I consult <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o <HI>pillage</HI> a spark|ling
Verse from here and there, or, like some
<HI>Chymic Angel</HI> (as a late Author or two have
it) to <HI>nimm a golden Fancy,</HI> on such Themes
as these? Would some good Body would advise
what Shop in <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Church-yard, Duck-Lane,</HI>
or <HI>Little-Brittain,</HI> I should consult to
find a Treatise of the Causes, Essence and Pro|perty's
of a piece of <HI>Ginger-bread,</HI> or in what
part of the Transactions of the <HI>Royal Soci|ety,</HI>
I should find how many yards a <HI>nimble
Louse reaches at Hop-Stride-and-Jump?</HI>
This too, by the way, may in some measure ex|cuse
my Digressions, tho' even those may, like
an Episode in a Play, be so managed as to
become a Grace, rather than a Blurr to the
design, if they ben't too many;&mdash;if proceed|ing
naturally from the main design, and all
helping towards it;&mdash;if not over-tedious; all
which Requisites, or most of 'em, will, I hope,
square with mine. For the filling so much of
the Book with Explanation,&mdash;Let's discourse
here for a while <HI>very gravely.</HI> Is't not bet|ter
to do thus than leave the Grammarians a
<HI>thousand year hence</HI> to scratch, and bite, and
break one anothers Heads about one's meaning,
as they do now about <HI>Perseus</HI>'s, where, may
be, like the Quakers, we deny meanings, and
<PB REF="7">
have, in that place, none at all. How would
poor <HI>Homer</HI> bless himself, were he, like his
own <HI>Ulisses,</HI> to return, and find how he is, since
his Death too, improv'd into a <HI>Statuary,</HI> a
Captain, a Moralist, a Politician, and would
you think it? a Divine too, and a thousand
other things he never so much as thought or
dream't of, <HI>poor old-Fellow,</HI> since the hour
he was born! But supposing the worst, or, if
you please, granting it, that <HI>Roguy Time
should be so sacrilegiously hungry</HI> as to de|vour
all these fine things in a Twelve-month
and a day, (as 'twould be a great Temptati|on,
I'll assure ye, to one sharp set to find 'em
<HI>under Pyes;</HI>) Yet, when for the reason before
alledg'd, it is impossible to have every where
common Notions on so uncommon Subjects,
I have by these <HI>Notes</HI> endeavoured to
make all plain to the meanest Capacity, with
as much brevity as could consist with clearness.
Nor in this very case is a noble Example want|ing,
were't not against the Rules of Decency,
to defend so little a thing with such great Au|thority.
For the Incongruities, which I doubt
not may, if any whose Eyes are <HI>sharpen'd
with Prejudice,</HI> or Iudgment, look close on
'em, be easily observed, (besides the Carelesness
and undress with which in many places the Verse
appears:) First, I remember I'm neither wri|ting
a Supposition in Philosophy, nor a System
<PB REF="8">
of Divinity, nor an <HI>Epic Poem,</HI> where indeed
all ought to be most religiously observ'd. What
was said by a person, however by Wits of a
greater Genius expos'd, yet certainly, if thir|ty
Years Experience be any thing, <HI>no Fool in
Poetry,</HI> has certainly a great deal of truth in't.
<Q><L>&mdash;He that servilely creeps after Sense,</L>
<L>Is safe, but ne'r shall reach at Excellence.</L></Q>
&mdash;Or somewhat like it; tho' perhaps he may
be as apt to censure others in that case, as
many have him. If this ben't enough, I would de|sire
such as are yet dissatisfi'd, to take notice, that
tho' for Reasons told <HI>half-an-hour-agon,</HI> this
was printed, yet I could never be vain enough
to think 'twould procure the Author much Re|putation;
and therefore, as I wa'n't over am|bitious
of seeing my worthy Name <HI>adorning a
Pissing-Post, or glittering in a Term-Cata|logue,</HI>
so nor did I think it worth the while
to throw away better time in making it more
correct, or shewing it to any person, not trou|bling
my few Friends with my Resolution to pub|lish
it. If any are so <HI>unconscionable,</HI> that all
this won't satisfie '<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">m, but either for <HI>old</HI> Ac|quaintance,
or <HI>new</HI> Remembrance they must be
finding or making faults, the comfort on't is,
I have the same liberty, and am as free to
think what I please of theirs, if ever they have
<PB REF="8">
or may come under the <HI>Predicament</HI> of the Au|thor&punc;&mdash;I
can't remember any thing more,
but,&mdash;You 're <HI>very welcome Gentlemen!</HI>

the black old Gentleman, thy Friend,
would have it, who ow'd thee a spight

'tis writ and spelt at such a rate,

none but such an incorrigible Blockhead

The New Waters discover'd there the last Summer.</P>

<HI>A couple of expeditious Gentlemen (as well mounted as the Witch in</HI> Paudaemonium) Astol|fo <HI>in</HI> Orlando Furioso <HI>on a</HI> Griffith: Pacolet <HI>in the famous and renowned Chronicle of</HI> Valen|tine <HI>and</HI> Orson, <HI>on a Wooden Horse.</HI></P>

You see Reader, other folks have had their Maggots as well as your Humble Servant. Two Bishops have wrote expresly of this new Plantation, and the way to sayl thither. One by making a Globe of Glass, or Brass lighter than the Atmos|phere, which must therefore naturally ascend:
<PB N="171" REF="94">
The other by a way perhaps as practicable as the former, by harnessing a certain number of Fowl, called by the Spaniards [<HI>Ganza's</HI>] on which he makes <HI>Signior Domingo</HI> hoisted thither.</P>

Vid. <HI>Where you can find it,</HI> this account. When any of the Woodcocks remain behind, the main body returning at Summer to the Land of the Moon, they are reported to be all lowsy.</P>

See Dr. <HI>Casauban's</HI> account of those Spirits with whom Dr. <HI>Dee</HI> and <HI>Kelly</HI> had contracted so intimate a Correspondence. Very good natur'd Devils it seems, for they perswaded the Conju|rers to sw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">p Wives, as a necessary Ceremony in their Magical operations.</P>

I would entreat any that know that hard-na|med Gentleman's right Name to keep silence, for 'twould' spoyl the Rhyme sadly if this should be blotted out, and that inserted.</P>
