<P>_ALthough my very good Lord, neither according to my ho|nest desire, nor your

honorable desert (wch worthily may chal|lenge from me a farre more dutifull service than my attendance upon you into <HI>Flan|ders)</HI> I could not in person, as I did in good will, be present in the same Journey (where I both might have reaped profit, and your Lordship been fully ascertained of my good mind towards you, for that I protest
<PB REF="5">
unto you remaining in this out-nook of the little world (where <HI>London</HI> newes is some|what scant, and the Princes affaires very seldome known) I had no intelligence of your so honourable place of Embassie in this year of Christ 1578. untill two daies after your departure. The which bred some corsey of a Melancho|ly conceipt in me, by
<PB REF="6">
reason of my foolish negligence that would no oftner direct my Letters to crave intel|ligence from <HI>London.</HI> And by reason of the unkind forgetfulnes of my kindred &amp; friends remaining there, who would not vouchsafe so much courtesie in a matter so much desi|red by me, and of so small a trouble to them, as to direct their Letters to me thereof.
<PB REF="6">
Wherefore sorrowing for that which is past, that I could not as the rest of my kindred, &amp; friends did, assume such enterprize upon me, and yet not only rejoycing at your ho|nourable entertain|ment, of the good suc|cess, of the wise Dis|patch, and of the or|derly behaviour, wher|with your Lordship was received beyond the Seas; but also de|sirous
<PB REF="7">
by pen amongst the rest of your wel|willers at this your happy and desired re|turn to congratulate your Lordship with the tokens of my old vowed fidelitie, as a sign of my hidden joy conceived of your safe arrival, I have thought it my challenged duty to direct this tedious Discourse unto you, containing aswell the unfolding of my for|mer
<PB REF="7">
griefs, As laying open to your sight the rejoycing of my well|willing heart. And for that other occasion doth not so fitly mini|ster cause to me in o|ther sort to present my self unto you than by saying somewhat wch may, &amp; doth concerne Embassadours; There|fore as wel for that the time is most apt for the man to whom I write, having supplied
<PB REF="8">
such place, &amp; for that it also putteth me in mind of your honou|rable courteous talk which you have often used unto me in like matters, I will here in affaires of Embassie to an Ambassadour pre|sent my labours, the Ambassadours of their absent Master, &amp; make discourse of things belonging to Embas|sie. Wherein I will shew the original, Pri|vileges,
<PB REF="8">
the Wisdom, the Valour, the quick wits, &amp; other the be|haviours of Ambassa|dours, as examples for us in all respects to im|mitate: For as <HI>Seneca</HI> saith in his sixth Epi|stle, <HI>Longum iter est per praecepta, breve &amp; efficax per exemplum,</HI> of which kind of people, that is of Ambassadours, Le|gats, or Deputies, Mes|sengers of Princes, and of the Orators of Kings (For all these severall
<PB REF="9">
termes do include one Function exercised in divers manners) be|cause there are sundry sorts somewhat diffe|rent from the custome of our age, I will not only intreat as they were in times past a|mongst the magnifi|cent Romans in the middest of their grea|test glory; But I wil al|so in like order collect, and digest the usage and duty of them as they are now used, &amp;
<PB REF="9">
put in office by Prin|ces, Kings, and Empe|rors, for the executing of their determined pleasure. In which (my good Lord) if any thing shall be found, that for want of more diligent search may seem faulty, consider that <HI>Bernardus non vi|det omnia.</HI> Wee are no Gods, wee can say no more than reasonable conj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">cture or former Authority may lead us unto. But if in the pla|cing
<PB REF="10">
of the same in the apt sentences, or in the sweet composition of stile there appear de|fault, impute the same to the want of leisure, and to the rude hasty writing of him, who was never brought up in any Vniversitie, and I seek not <HI>fucum ver bo|rum,</HI> so I may have <HI>ip|sam veritatem, &amp; mate|riam solidam.</HI> And thus, this far of that; And so into my purposed matter.</P>

with short abridg|ment thereof drawn out of many Histories, as if I had privately noted them for my selfe, sufficiently confirming whatsoever I shall here utter unto your Lordship, as requisite for an Ambassadour to doe, to receive, to deliver, and to professe; wherefore in that order I will discend to this matter, that other Nations besides the Ro|mans used Ambassadours by intercourse to dispatch the affaires of their Coun|tries having to deal with other Princes. And be|cause (as I said) the Jews were a people <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ost anci|ent,
<PB N="9" REF="16">
I will therefore begin with them, as men from whom all Government and Order, Learning, Moralitie, Philosophie, and all other notable things have been derived, though somewhat alte|red and corrupted by the evilnesse of other Nati|ons, separating themselves from the true people of God, and right use of his Religion. <HI>Phineas</HI> the Priest, the Son of <HI>Eliazer,</HI> with ten Princes of the ten Tribes, was sent Am|bassadour to the Israelites beyond <HI>Iordan; Zoroba|bel, Annanias,</HI> and <HI>Mor|docheus</HI> were appointed
<PB N="10" REF="17">
Legates of the Jewes, and sent to <HI>Darius,</HI> King of <HI>Persia,</HI> that they might accuse the Samaritans hindring the reedifying of the Temple. <HI>Iosephus, lib. 11. cap. 4. Eupolemus</HI> the Sonne of <HI>Iohn,</HI> and <HI>Iason</HI> the Son of <HI>Eliazer</HI> were from <HI>Iudas Macha|beus</HI> sent Ambassadours to the Romans to joyne friendship with them. <HI>Ma|chab. cap.</HI> 8.</P>
<P>And likewise as the Jews, so the Greeks, when come to <HI>Tenedos,</HI> they sent Messengers to the Tro|jans for the delivery of <HI>Hellen,</HI> which were <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">lisses,</HI> an eloquent Orator, fur|nished
<PB N="11" REF="17">
with Copie of Speech, and Wisdome, and <HI>Menelaus,</HI> who was briefe, and pithy in Sen|tences, that the one by his Eloquence, the other by the force of his Ar|gument, might move the Trojans. In like sort <HI>Mirsus</HI> the Sonne of <HI>Giges</HI> was sent by <HI>Orestes</HI> the Governour to <HI>Policrates,</HI> the most fortunate Prince of the world, and King of the Samnites, to the end that hee might entice and entrap him by his Speech, and hope of gain to bee received, which hee did effect ac|cordingly (as teacheth

<HEAD>CRAP. 3. What persons are meete to be Ambassadours.</HEAD>
<P>THE person who ought to dispatch these things must be (as is requisite in all other causes of Govern|ment) learned, well born, free, no bond-man, of good credit in respect of his honesty, of good esti|mation in respect of his calling, that he be no lyar, vaunter, dissembler, or Traytor; But that he be wise, valiant, circumspect, furnished with divers Languages, eloquent, of
<PB N="14" REF="19">
quick capacitie, of ready deliverance, liberall, com|ly of person, tall of sta|ture, and briefly that he be adorned with all ver|tues required, or com|mendable, in a good man, and unfurnished of any vice to blemish his cre|dit, or that may win him the Surname of a wicked man. First, that he must be learned (besides many reasons that may be made for it) these examples fol|lowing shall manifest. In so much that it appeareth, that Princes did alwayes choose forth the best lear|ned to dispatch their af|faires. <HI>Amalarius Fortu|natus,</HI>

by Nation a Ger|man, a Monk of <HI>Luxo|nia,</HI> a man very elo|quent in the Greek, and Latin, and Archbishop of <HI>Trevers</HI> for his learning, was the Legat of <HI>Charles</HI> the great, to <HI>Michael</HI> the Emperour of <HI>Constanti|nople,</HI> to joyn and con|firme amitie, and peace with him, in the year of Christ 813. So <HI>Iesse</HI> a learned Bishop, for that he had singular know|ledge in the Greek tongue, was made by <HI>Charles the Great,</HI> Legate to <HI>Irenee</HI> the Empresse of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> for to in|treat of peace. <HI>Amionius,

<PB N="17" REF="20">
age, who were called <HI>Me|thochides, Theodorus,</HI> and <HI>Iohannes Glyces,</HI> whereof the one was <HI>Domesticus,</HI> and the other (as saith <HI>Gregorius, lib. 6.) Dromo|logotheta,</HI> whom he did not so much choose to that place, because they had great use, and expe|rience of things, but be|cause they did excell in wisdome, in plentifull knowledge of Divine and Humane things, and in the understanding of the Greek tongue. For they had need to be such per|sons, that should supply a Legats place in a forraign Nation. Since they should
<PB N="18" REF="21">
be instructed in many Languages, and should obtain the victory in all kindes of disputations, as was <HI>Haido,</HI> or <HI>Hatto,</HI> Bi|shop of <HI>Basile,</HI> sent Am|bassadour in 811. by <HI>Charles the Great,</HI> to <HI>Con|stantinople,</HI> to make peace, who (as <HI>Aventinus, lib.</HI> 4. testifieth) wrote the Book intituled <HI>Itinerarium.</HI></P>
<P>Thus having learning, and divers Languages, yet hee is not sufficient to play the Ambassadour, unlesse he be able in like sort Rhetorically by per|swading eloquence, in apt words, ready tongue, sweet voyce, and speedy
<PB N="19" REF="21">
deliverance to discharge his Message; For such is the force of words, as it often worketh strange mi|racles; For besides that vertue which the <HI>Philoso|phers,</HI> the <HI>Cabalists,</HI> the <HI>Divines,</HI> and the <HI>Magici|ans</HI> doe place in pro|nouncing words, we find eloquence to be of such force, that it moveth un|sensible creatures to be reclaimed unto reason. And thereupon was <HI>Or|pheus</HI> feigned by his Mu|sick to draw trees, stones, mountaines, and wilde beasts after him, for that by his sweet words he re|duced the savage people

their Coffers for Merchan|dize sake great store of gold thred to make and weave cloth-of-gold; the which they then brought to avoyd further charge of carriage for the same; which foolish subtilty in so grave a matter, wrap|ped about with the filthi|nesse of gain, was the more to be jested at, Because when they had delivered their Message, they had brought no further autho|ritie to confirm the Peace. Wherefore</HI> Clement, <HI>and</HI> Caesar <HI>also, scorning them, and stomacking the cove|tousnesse and unskill of the Merchants, did so upbraid

<HEAD>CHAP. 4. What Lawes, and privi|leges were made, and allowed for and to Ambassadours.</HEAD>
<P>ALthough this matter may best by a Ci|vilian be discussed, for that the same is most plentifully known unto them, and is a thing that I cannot well intreat of, for that I have not acquain|ted my selfe with <HI>Iustini|ans</HI> Writings, and De|crees: yet so far-forth, as either in History, or other Authoritie, I have read, or collected any thing

thereof, I shall not refuse to say what I can, though not so much as I would, though not so much as the matter could bear, and though not so much as your Lordship might learn from others to your contentment, and my de|sire; And therefore to say what I can, I affirm, That it is but reason (since Am|bassadours endanger their persons, consume their substance, travell their wits, toyle their bodyes, serve their Countrie, and uphold their Prince) that they should be Franchised with such liberties, as both might be safety for them|selves,

and guerdon for their deserts; or else who would willingly discharge that thing, the perform|ance whereof shall not so much as defend his life?

that to Legates, and forraign Nations, ad|mitted into the Senate, the Roman Consulls were not accustomed to give any answers, but only in Latin, who being admitted after the manner of the Fathers, the Senate gave them pow|er of that they would have; but the Greeks (by their Deputies appointed) did declare their minds, if any body required any thing, as the</HI> Atrebates, <HI>and</HI> Belo|naces <HI>did assemble their Councells by the sound of Trumpets.

the Senate) were Inter|preters given, by whom they did propound what was needfull, and receive the agreement, and answers of the Senate.</HI></P>
<P>And although <HI>Molo</HI> the Rhetorician is first said to have declamed in Greek in the Senate; yet so much did <HI>Tiberius</HI> hate the Greek tongue, that endea|vouring to speak (I well know not what in the Se|nate) in Greek, hee first craved pardon therefore.</P>
<P><HI>And</HI> Claudius Caesar <HI>did rase out of the Table of the Iudges, and sent away the Governuur of a Province in Greece, for that

<P><HI>DArius</HI> the King en|tring into <HI>Scythia,</HI> was driven to great need, and povertie; Whereupon the Scythians sent Le|gates unto him with pre|sents, which were, a Bird, a Mouse, a Frog, and five Arrowes, which <HI>Darius</HI> interpreted after his mind, that thereby they did yield themselves, and the Countrey; By the Mouse, understanding the Land;
<PB N="51" REF="37">
by the Frog, the Waters; by the Bird, their Horses; and by the Arrows, their Bodyes. But <HI>Gobrias</HI> did conjecture, that these pre|sents did speak to contra|ry effect.

<PB N="61" REF="42">
who preparing to plead the cause of his Nation, was repulsed of <HI>Caesar,</HI> and commanded to de|part; The Emperour scarce for anger abstain|ing from doing him inju|rie; wherefore he being thus cast out with reproch amongst men, fled to the assistance of God, and turning to the Jewes his followers said, wee must now be of good comfort, for when <HI>Caius</HI> is offen|ded with us, God shall work against him for us.</P>
<P><HI>Leo Bizantius,</HI> when he was sent Ambassadour to <HI>Athens,</HI> entring into the Assemblie, to pacifie a

<P>Ambassadours being dispatched to <HI>Pirrhus,</HI> did come to redeem certain prisoners, amongst the which Legates was <HI>Caius Fabritius,</HI> whose fame and name was had in great estimation amongst the Romans, being a vertuous man in peace, and a noble Souldiour in warre, but yet very poor, which <HI>Ci|neas</HI> declared unto the King; Whereupon <HI>Pir|rhus</HI> did privately use him very courteously, conten|ding with him to take re|ward
<PB N="64" REF="44">
of gold at his hands, not for any evill cause, but as he said, as a pledge of friendship, and good entertainment; the which <HI>Fabritius</HI> refusing, silence was made thereof for that time. The next day (to the end he might fear <HI>Fa|britius,</HI> who never before had seen an Elephant) <HI>Pirrhus</HI> commanded the great beast, as they were in talking, to be brought, and set behind a skreen, which was so done, then a sign being given, the skreen was removed, and the Elephant lifting up his nostrill, did hang it over the head of <HI>Fabritius,</HI>
<PB N="65" REF="44">
sounding up a sharp, and terrible noyse, whereat <HI>Fabritius,</HI> by little and lit|tle turning back, said to <HI>Pirrhus,</HI> neither thy gold yesterday, nor thy beast to day can move me. Af|ter at supper, when talk was had of the Greeks, and of the Philosophers, <HI>Cineas</HI> fell to naming of the Epicures, reciting what they thought of the Gods, and of the Com|mon-wealth, how they placed their chiefest feli|citie in pleasure, how they avoyded the government of the State as trouble|some, and hurtfull to good life, and how the gods
<PB N="66" REF="45">
were removed from re|warding, from anger, and from care, of, to, and over us, leading an idle life, flowing with all pleasure. To whom yet thus speak|ing, <HI>Fabritius</HI> cryed out; O God, be these Precepts pleasant to <HI>Pirrhus,</HI> and the Samnites, whilest they make warre with us. Up|on the which <HI>Pirrhus</HI> marvelling at the mind, and gravitie of the man, did more earnestly studie, by breaking off the wars, to joyne friendship with the Romans, privately in|viting <HI>Fabritius</HI> (if the Peace were performed) to remain and live with
<PB N="67" REF="45">
him, offering that he should enjoy the chiefest place amongst his friends, and Nobles. To whom <HI>Fabritius</HI> is said to have answered in his eare. It will not be for thy profit O King, for those that do now worship, and follow thee, if they had made tryall of me, would wish me king to thee. With which <HI>Pirrhus</HI> was no whit offended, nor took it with a Tyrannicall mind, but did declare to <HI>Fabri|tius</HI> friends, the noble disposition of the man.

<HEAD>CRAP. 3. Ambassadours that dyed in their Embassie.</HEAD>
<P>AS you have before heard what good things have been com|mended in Legates, and Ambassadours, how they have been rewarded, ho|noured, esteemed, prefer|red, what privileges, what entertainment, and how many other good things have been belong|ing unto them. So since there is nothing certain in this world, nothing hap|py on every side, but that every commoditie brings
<PB N="74" REF="49">
its discommoditie, these men with all these good matters are subject to as many evils, misfortunes, losses, and hinderances, as they seem to be adorned with many excellencies. And therefore having al|ready spoken of the first part, I will come to the later part of this Propo|sition, and lay before your eyes their misfortunes, how some have died by the way, some have been slain, some maymed, some blinded, and some many other wayes misused, as the malice of the doer, or the will of the Com|mander gave in charge

<HEAD>CHAP. 7. Ambassadours evilly en|treated in their Em|bassie.</HEAD>
<P>IT is shewed before in the privileges of Am|bassadours, that their Im|munitie should be such as they ought not to be tou|ched for any offence in their Legation, no not for conspiracie against ano|ther Prince. Then since
<PB N="83" REF="53">
this was the Law called <HI>Ius Gentium,</HI> which was (as touching Legates) called <HI>Divinum,</HI> for that commonly they sought to maintain godly Peace. How much are those per|sons, Kings, or others, to be blamed, that have of|fered violence to such men, which of themselves doe nothing, but execute the commandement of their Superiours? to resist whom is punishable, as well before God, as be|fore men; Disobedience being such a vice as God abhorreth, Man punish|eth, Reason misliketh, and Law condemneth.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="54">
Wherefore as good Princes have been com|mended to their perpetu|all glory, for the liberali|tie, good using, and en|tertainment of Ambassa|dours: So evill Kings to their continuall shame are registred in remembrance for abusing, violating, and offending such persons. And therefore under this Title, I will set down both what Ambassadours have been injured, in what sort it was done, by whom, for what cause, and to whose despight it hath been pra|ctised, as followeth.</P>
<P>First, the Ambassadours of <HI>Darius,</HI> requiring in

great words. Earth, and Water to be given them, which amongst the Persi|ans, was a token of yield|ing, or subjection, were soon headlong thrown in|to Ditches, and some into deep Wells, and Dunge|ons. <HI>Alexander ab A|lexandro, li. 4. cap.</HI> 7.</P>

continueth at this day, of which there did flourish two hundred noble perso|nages) and being Cardi|nall of St. <HI>Praxedis</HI> was Ambassador in the ex|pedition to <HI>Hierusalem</HI> which was in the year 1200. where hee did al|most suffer Martyrdome, for he was of the barba|rous Enemies included between two posts readie to be cut in sunder, unless the Divine providence, and his great constancie had not moved them to relent. <HI>Volat. li. 22.

<P><HI>A. Gabinius</HI> the Le|gate, after many things prosperously done against the <HI>Lucans,</HI> and many Towns overthrown, was slain at a siege. <HI>Livius, li.</HI> 76.</P>

<P>In the second year of the <HI>Peloponesian</HI> warre, the Lacedemonians experien|cing all devises to over|throw the riches of <HI>A|thens,</HI> sent Legates un|to <HI>Artaxerxes</HI> into <HI>Asia,</HI> which should require aid, and money to the use of the warre, and also should as they made their passage through <HI>Thracia,</HI> attempt

<P>The Tarentines by occa|sion setting upon the Ro|man men of warre carried away the same, having killed the Captain of the Fleet, with many other persons, by reason where|of Legates were sent from <HI>Rome</HI> after the manner of the Citie to demand re|stitution of their goods, whom the Tarentines (ad|ding one mischief to ano|ther) did violate against the Law of Nations.

<P><HI>Iulianus Apostata</HI> (so called, for that he denyed the Christian faith, being Emperour) with unspea|kable furie raging against the Christians, contrarie to all Law, and equitie, did not at <HI>Calordan</HI> fear to murder <HI>Manuel Sabel|les,</HI> and <HI>Ismael,</HI> because they were Christians, and sent Ambassadours to him out of <HI>Persia.

either <HI>Paterbenus</HI> of <HI>Apris,</HI> or <HI>Alexander</HI> of the A|thenians should bee so cruelly handled, doing what in them lay? for when the obstinacie of the other party with whom they must conferre, is so much, that neither reason can move, eloquence per|swade, gentle usage make willing, or threatnings fear to yield unto their Ambassie, what shall the poor Legates doe? and if they bring not their mes|sage to effect, they shall be sharply punished at their return, as either faithlesse to their Masters, or partiall to the enemie.
<PB N="137" REF="80">
For, mee thinks, I hear some Sycophant flattering the Prince, and maligning the Ambassadour (either before his going for some private grudge, or after his departure, for his open honour, in that he is ad|vanced to his place of Legation) and yet set|ting his own commoditie thereby doth say, that if the matter come not to effect, it is by the negli|gence of the partie Am|bassadour, who if hee carry not sufficient autho|ritie to conclude, or an|swer all things done on the adverse part, may send home for a larger Com|mission,

the which if hee doe not, if thereby hee might have brought it to conclusion, is to be dee|med as a trayterous per|son to his Prince, and Countrie, and therefore at his return to be punish|ed.

<P>AS all injuries which tend to the subversi|on of a Common-wealth are to bee punished, be|cause not one Citie, but a Province, not a part of the body, but the whole body, not the King alone, but the subject is grieved thereby; so the same wrong (being injustice) is not only to be avoyded (by all good men) as chiefe enemy to vertue, but also they are to be
<PB N="141" REF="82">
hated, and sharply punish|ed, which contrary to na|turall dutie to the Prince, to equity, to his Countrie, to good disposition to|wards himselfe, to vertue, to good men, and contra|ry to Justice, to all men in matter of trust (wherin all truth is to be used) do fals|ly, and injuriously betray their Children, their Pa|rents, their Friends, their King, their Countrie. And as in all men such treason is to be abhorred, so especially in Ambassa|dours, who are the doors, and gates of the Com|mon-wealth, by which Peace, or Warre, quiet,
<PB N="142" REF="83">
or dissention, profit, or disco~moditie are brought into the same. This vilde fault is most abhorred, and worthy to be reward|ed with death, a thing which in all ages, amongst all men, in all places, and in all matters hath been misliked, hated, condem|ned, and revenged. Be|cause no greater injurie can any wayes be offered, than that hee who is in credit, with the life, with the commoditie, with the honour, with the state of his Prince, or Countrie, with the benefit of his friend, or familiar, should under the colour of assu|red

dutie, and friendship, overthrow such State, or person, as giveth such fidelity unto him. But what spend I many words to confirm a thing so ma|nifestly known to be evil?

which may fall into the like inconveniencie, if fear of God, discourse of reason, duty to the Prince, love to his Countrie, and fidelity to his friends and Allies, do not restrain the evill mind of mens natu|rall inclination alwayes of it selfe by disposition bent to the worst, and ready to yield to his basest part.

<P>And so with one Hi|storie more delivered in Latine, as <HI>Guicchardine</HI> hath written it, I will set end to these trayterous, and unfaithfull Ambassa|dours; The which matter I have purposely delive|red in Latine as the course of the style leadeth word for word, and as the Au|thor writ the same, for that not reading the Hi|storie in any other place,

<P>With which Latine Hi|storie concluding, and ut|tering what I have read concerning such unfaith|full Legates, who without better government may be drawn into Treason, one of the most wicked evills, which by their own occasion, and folly they may rashly fall into, I will finish up the enlarging of this proposition concern|ing trayterous Ambassa|dours, with their manner of treacherie. And take upon me briefly in like order, with like manner

of examples to treat of one other mischiefe that followeth such Ambassa|dours; For as there is no Body but hath its shadow, no Corn but hath its chaffe, no Wine but hath its lees, nor any man that at all times, in all places, in all matters, and to all persons doth shew him|selfe alike perfect wise: So since these Legates hereafter may (as before time they have) by words, by writings, by deeds, by gestures, shew some folly in them (though other|wise perhaps not to bee discommended) I will now discourse of foolish

<HEAD>CHAP. 11. Of the foolish sayings, and doings of Ambassadours.</HEAD>
<P>NOtwithstanding that it often happeneth to be counted a point of wisdome to dissemble, and to utter great folly, yet in a Legate, in a matter of gravitie, in the benefit of a Countrie, in the cause of a King, to shew either folly in the tongue, rash|nesse
<PB N="161" REF="92">
in the hand, light|ness in the gesture, clow|nishness in action, or want of good government in ordering himselfe, is not simply a fault in the A|gent, which yet is not to bee allowed, but also it stretcheth further, and ministreth occasion to condemn the Master, or Prince, for want of judge|ment, that either hee had not people out of whom, or else had not in him to discern to whom he might have better committed such a waighty charge, a thing not to be imagined of the head, and Gover|nour of the Common-wealth,
<PB N="162" REF="93">
and kingdome; Wherefore as you have before on the one side wise Ambassadours, ho|noured and commended for their singular and quick wits in answering, for their worthy, and pru|dent dispatch of their Embassie in action. So on the other side you shall now see, That they who doe not advisedly consi|der the place wherein, the person to whom, the mat|ter whereof they are to use their speech, doe not only fall into many grosse errors, which hurt them|selves, injurie their Coun|tries, and shame their
<PB N="163" REF="93">
Princes; But that they al|so thereby become a note, and blot of Ignominie to be left behind them in their utter condemnation, and the heavy reproch of their posteritie, as is pro|ved by these persons fol|lowing, vouched for that intent, whose children al|though they might be condemned, as discended from Ambassadours, yet it is reprochfull to have the folly, and evill of their Ancestors to be spightful|ly objected unto them. And so to the matter. The people of <HI>Florence</HI> sent an Orator or Ambas|sadour to <HI>Iane</HI> Queen of
<PB N="164" REF="94">
<HI>Naples</HI> (of life inconti|nent, and such a person as hanged her Husband, a gallant young Prince, out of her Chamber window, for that he could not the night before content her immoderate, and insatia|ble leacherie) called <HI>Fran|cis,</HI> a certain Lawyer by profession, but better lear|ned in wearing the appa|rell of a Civillian, than deeply seen in the judge|ment of <HI>Iustinian;</HI> And yet more unlearned in|deed then he appeared in shew. This man being called into the Queens presence to performe his charge; when he had ut|tered
<PB N="165" REF="94">
with some good care the effects of his Le|gation, was the next day commanded to return to the Court to hear his an|swer: (In the mean time having intelligence, that the Queen loved proper men, not disdaining such persons as were of excel|lent beauty) but when ac|cording to commande|ment he was returned to Court, there after many things spoken this way, and that way, about his Embassie unto the Queen, at length more impudent than wise, more glorious than seemly, brake with the Queen, and said, that
<PB N="166" REF="95">
he had farre more secret matters to impart unto her. Whereupon the gen|tle Queen desirous to sa|tisfie his Legation in all convenient order, and deeming the matters of great importance should be revealed unto her self, courteously called him in|to a more secret place, where the fool, besides all order, and civilitie, much flattering himselfe in the excellencie of his beautie, demanded of her societie in the act of <HI>Venus.</HI> At which the wise Queen no|thing abashed, nor altered into any sudden passion, beholding the counte|nance
<PB N="167" REF="95">
of the man, did on|ly smiling ask whether the Florentines had given him the same in commissi|on also, and telling him that he were best to have authority therefore, with|out further anger willed him to depart home. <HI>Pog|gius in facetiis.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ariston</HI> the Tyrant of <HI>Athens,</HI> (besieged and subdued by <HI>L.

<P>The Perusines sending Orators to <HI>Urbaim</HI> Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> (afflicted with sicknesse) one of them without respect of the griefe of the Pope, used a long, and tedious Ora|tion. The other who grieved at the folly of the first Speaker, then being to mend all, fell into a far more offence to move an|ger in the Bishop, saying, That it was given them in charge, that except they

were answered forthwith, they should repeat the same Oration again. At whose folly the Bishop smiling, co~manded them to be quickly dispatched. <HI>Poggius in facetiis.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Franciscus Codelmerius</HI> a Cardinall, being with a Navy sent Legate against the Turks, subduing <HI>Hel|lespont,</HI> by his folly, and ignorance, suffered the Turks to passe out of that streight, and gave no war|ning to the Christians, wherein he might, and did seem to be author (by his stupiditie) of that me|morable, and lamentable slaughter of the Christi|ans

<P>In the wars which were kept between Pope <HI>Gre|gorie</HI> the Eleventh, and the Florentines, a Legate of the Racavatenses being sent to <HI>Florence,</HI> gave them thanks for the liber|ties restored, inveighing with many despightfull words against the Bishop, and the Princes of the Ci|ty, &amp; the Ministers of the Bishop, having no respect to <HI>Radolphus,</HI> Lord of the Camerines, who was then <HI>Potimansis</HI> or chiefe Go|vernour of <HI>Florence,</HI> for the Bishop. Whereupon
<PB N="172" REF="98">
<HI>Radolphus</HI> demanded of the Ambassadour of what facultie or Art he was, to whom he answered, a Do|ctor of the Civill Law, then he asked how long he had applied that stu|die, the Legate said, more than ten years. O reply|ed <HI>Radolphus,</HI> very glad would I have been, that you had bestowed a yeare thereof to learn discreti|on, and wisdome, judge|ing him a simple foole, that in his presence being one of the number, would so lavishly bluster out such heavie words against the Princes and Rulers. <HI>Poggius.</HI></P>

<PB N="180" REF="102">
committing all other mat|ters to silence, which I could speak of them, and their office; Since these Messengers of Prin|ces to Princes, had their first originall from the Angellicall Order of Archangells, who are made the Ambassadours of God, to great Perso|nages in great matters, ei|ther of Revelation of the successe of Kingdomes, as <HI>Gabriel</HI> was to <HI>Daniel,</HI> or of opening some rare, and strange thing, as hee was also to the Virgin of the Conception of the Saviour of our Souls,

and Redeemer of us from our Sinnes; For this is certain, that there is no order, or government in this world, as well Eccle|siasticall as Temporall, but it is had from the pat|tern of the Celestiall Hierarchie; Since God Created the world, and appointed the govern|ment thereof according to the Architype, chiefe pattern, or Ideall forme of the same, conceived in the divine mind, and or|dered in the Celestiall Hierarchy.
