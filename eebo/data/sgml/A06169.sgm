<P>_GEntlemen, I am preuented in mine own hopes; in seconding thrifts forward desires. Som foure yeres since being at sea with <HI>M. Candish</HI> (whose memorie if I repent not, I lament not) it was my chance in the librarie of the Iesuits in <HI>San|ctum</HI> to find this historie in the Spanish tong, which as I read delighted me, and delighting me, wonne me, and winning me, made me write it. The place where I began my worke, was a ship, where many souldiers of good reckning finding distur|bed stomackes; it can not but stand with your discretions to pardon an vndiscreete and vnstaied penne, for hands may vary where stomacks miscary. The time I wrote in, was when I had rather will to get my dinner, then to win my fame. The order I wrote in, was past order, where I rather obserued mens ha~ds lest they should strike me, then curious reason of men to con|demne mee. In a worde, I wrote vnder hope rather the fish should eate both me writing, and my paper written, then fame should know me, hope should acquaint her with me, or any but miserie should heare mine ending. For those faults (gen|tlemen) escaped by the Printer, in not being acquainted with my hand, and the booke printed in my absence, I must craue you with fauour to iudge of, and with your wonted curtesies to correct; and according to Ecclesiasticall law, giue vs on our confession absolution: if you will not, remember this, that a countrie lasse for Ladies, may tell them they curle too much; and for Gentlemen, that they are vnfashioned by their fashi|ons. To be short, who liues in this world, let him wincke in the world; for either men prooue too blinde in seeing too litle, or too presumptuous in condemning that they shoulde not.</P>

<HEAD>&para; A Margarite of America for La|dies delight, and Ladies honour.</HEAD>
<P>_THe blushing morning gan no sooner appeare from the desired bed of her old paramor, &amp; remembring hir of hir <HI>Cephalus,</HI> watered the bosome of sweete floures with the christal of hir teares: but both the armies (awaked by the harmonie of the birds, that re|corded their melody in euery bush, be|gan to arme them in their tents, &amp; speedily visit their trenches: Among the rest the two emperors (the one, <HI>Protomachus</HI> of <HI>Mosco,</HI> the other, <HI>Artosogon</HI> of <HI>Cusco</HI>) considering with themselues, the care Princes ought to haue that commaund multitudes; the prefixed houre of their fight alreadie arriued, sodainely armed themselues, commanding their corronels by sound of trumpet to draw out their companies into the plain: Then marched forth ech squadron, deaffing the aire with their cries, dimming the sunne with the reflexion of their costly cu|rets, their high lookes promised happy forwardnes, and their haughtie hearts were portraied in their dreadlesse demeane. At the last embattailed in due order, the pikemen in a <HI>Mace|donian</HI> phalanx, the horsemen in their out-wings, the shot as gards to the pikes, al as protectors of their colours, the fatall charge was sounded, and both the armies marched forward to incounter; (when sodainly an old man, whose sober lookes be|tokened his seuere thoughts, whose morneful garments, sha|dowed, his melancholie minde,) bearing the Image of the Gods, (whom he most honoured) betweene his armes, and the homage a true subiect ought to haue in his heart, thrust him|selfe betweene both the armies, when sending many sighes
<PB REF="4">
from his breast to famous pittie, and teares from his eies to moue compassion, he fixed both his hands on their knees (who were neerely encountered to enter combate) and began in their termes to perswade both the monarchs (whilst both the armies withdrew their weapons, to giue diligent attention to his words:) Stay your vnbridled furies, O you Princes, &amp; let not the world say, that you who were borne to be the defen|ders of the monarchies, are (through your il-gouerned furies) become the destroyers of mankinde. Whereto tendeth this your vniust armes? if for your priuate grudges; oh how fond are you, that to reuenge your mislikes, are the murtherers of many innocents? If to enlarge your signiories; oh how vaine are you, that seek to attaine that with bloud, which you must keepe with care; that labor to sell that with stripes, which you haue bought with peace; that trauel to loose your own estates and signiories, for alitle name of souerainty? Heare me O you Princes (nay rather be aduised by me:) you haue spent huge treasures, made many widdowes, lost three yeares, and for what I pray you? for the right of one citie, the whole confines and reuenewes whereof is not sufficient to acquit for one mo|neth of your charges: O vnhappy <HI>Mantinea,</HI> the cause of such hartburning: O lawles name of seigniory, the occasion of such sorrows. Heare what <HI>Plutarch</HI> saith, Ye potentates, there is no warre that taketh head amongst men, but of vice: for ei|ther the loue of pleasure, either couetousnes, ambition or de|sire of rule, prouoketh the same. If this be true, as it is most certaine, why blush you not (Princes) to behold your owne follies? why reconcile you not to amend your misdeedes? If you say there are more pleasures in <HI>Mantinea,</HI> then in your seueral countries, you detract from whole prouinces, to make proud one poore cittie: and if it were, what a vaine thing is it, that such as are in authority should purchase a priuate delight by publike danger? <HI>Plato</HI> being demanded why he praised the <HI>Lydians</HI> so much, and dispraised the <HI>Lacedemonians</HI> so high|ly, answered thus: If I commend the <HI>Lydians,</HI> it is for that they were neuer occupied but in tilling the field: and if I do re|proue the <HI>Lacedemonians,</HI> it is because they knew nothing else but to conquer Realmes: so vertuous a thing hath it bin
<PB REF="4">
held by the learned to maintaine peace, and to shunne occasi|ons of contention. If you will be held vertuous and monar|chies (as I wish you should be) desire nothing to the domage of your common weales, lest in satisfying your owne humors ye subuert your subiects happines. If for couetousnes ye hunt after conquests, how vaine are you, labouring like mad men to lay more straw on your houses to burn them, and cast more water on the sea to drowne it? Couetousnes is an affection that hath no end, an extreame that hath no meane, a profit full of preiudice. Wel said <HI>Aristotle</HI> in his Politikes, there is no extreme pouertie but that of couetousnes. If for ambitio~, wel may ye weep with <HI>Alexander,</HI> to be laughed at, practise with <HI>Zenos,</HI> to repent with him: for in desiring beyond your reach, you fall besides your hopes. But if all these euills be growen to one head, if your incontinencie in desire, your excessiue thirst after pleasure, your couetous longing after riches, your ambi|tious hunting after seignioritie, haue occasioned this warre; subdue these errors in your selues for your subiects sakes: and sith <HI>Protomachus</HI> hath one daughter, and no more to inherit <HI>Mosco,</HI> and <HI>Artosogon</HI> one sonne and heire to suceede in the Empire of <HI>Cusco</HI>; let both these be ioyned together in happie matrimonie: so shall the cause of this different be quicklie de|cided, your selfe may roote out your ingrafted errors, your subiects enioy their desired peace, and finally, your Children shal haue greater cause to praise their fathers foresight, then to repent hereafter their vniust furie. Hereunto I coniure you, O you Princes, by these holy gods, whom you honour, by these hoarie haires which you should reueren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, lest your subiects hereafter ruinated through your rashnes, haue rather occasion to curse you then commend you. In <HI>Octauius Cae|sars</HI> time, each one thought himselfe fortunate to be borne vn|der his emperie, and him happie that maintained his prouince in peace: so let it be said of you (good Princes) and leaue you such memorie to your succession: than shall I thinke my selfe happie in my perswasions, and you shall be famous to all po|steritie.</P>
<P>No sooner had he ended his oration, but both the emperors resolued, by his reasons, and pacified by the perswasions of
<PB REF="5">
their nobilitie (who after long debate and consultation, and cheare behoouefull) drew to an accord: wherin it was conclu|ded, that <HI>Arsadachus</HI> the youthful heire of <HI>Cusco</HI> shoulde bee sent to the emperor of <HI>Mosco,</HI> where, (considering the worthi|nes of his court) he shuld find fit companions, &amp; apply himself to fancie, being continually in the presence of his faire <HI>Mar|garita</HI>: finally (after the decease of both the Princes) it was enacted that both <HI>Mantinea</HI> and the whole empire, should re|maine to <HI>Arsadachus,</HI> and <HI>Margarita</HI> and their heires for e|uer. These articles thus concluded vpon, both the campes brake vp; the braue knights who to-fore time delighted in tos|sing of lances, now haue no other pleasure but in talking with faire Ladies, the souldiers sword, was changed to a husband|mans sithe; his gay Curets, to a grey frocke; the gates which beforetime were shut against foes, were now opened to all sorts as vnsuspected friends: Such libertie followeth peace, exempted from the tyranny of warre. <HI>Artosogon</HI> withdrew his folowers to his owne frontires, &amp; returning to his court, made honourable prouision for his sonne <HI>Arsadachus</HI> to send him to <HI>Moscouia. Protomachus</HI> (after he had rewarded each souldier according to his desert) withdrew himselfe to the ca|stel of that aged father, who had so faithfully councelled him, (yeelding him for rewarde the dukedome of <HI>Volgradia,</HI> the chiefest place of honor through all <HI>Moscouy</HI>) whither, as to the open theater of al delights, the nobility &amp; ladies resorted, among the which the chiefest, fairest, and chastest <HI>Margarita,</HI> presented her selfe, reioycing at the happie reconcilement: where being resolued by hir father of y^e contract that was con+cluded vpon, with blushes at first shewed hir modestie, &amp; with obedience at last condescended to his minde. In this rare for|tresse of <HI>Arsinous</HI> (scituate by a gratious and siluer floting riuer, inuironed with curious planted trees to minister shade, and sweete smelling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">loures, to recreate the sences; besides the curious knots, the dain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ie gardin plots, the rich tapestrie, the royall attendance) <HI>Protomachus</HI> found as euident signes of high spirit, as of huge expence: at the entrance, of his chamber (which had a prospect into a delicious garden in which al sorts of birds inclosed in a Cage of christall recorded their harmo|nies,

whilst the gentle fall of a bubling fountaine seemed to yeeld a sweet and murmuring consent to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">heir musicke) was placed that sentence of <HI>Drusius Germanicus</HI> which he carried alwayes ingraued in his ring.</P>
<P>Illis est grauis fortuna quibus est repentina.</P>
<P>About the walles of the chamber in curious imagerie were the seuen sages of Greece, set forth with their seueral vertues, eloquently discouered in <HI>Arabicke</HI> verses: The bed appointed for the prince to rest himselfe, was of blacke Ebonie enchased which Rubies, Diamons and Carbun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ls, made inform of an arch, on which by degrees mans state from infancie to his olde age was plainly depictured, and on the testerne of the bed the whole contents of the same most sagelie desciphered in these verses.

Thus sumptuous was the lodging of <HI>Protomachus,</HI> but far more glorious the chamber of <HI>Margarita</HI> which seemed from the first day to be fashioned to her affections, for ouer the en|trance of the doores was drawen and carued out of curious white marble, the faire goddesse of chastitie blushing at the sodaine interception of <HI>Acteon,</HI> and her naked nymphes, who with the one hand, couering their owne secret pleasures with blushes, with the other cast a beautifull vaile ouer their mi|stresse daintie nakednes: the two pillers of the doore were beautified with the two <HI>Cupids</HI> of <HI>Auacreon,</HI> which well sha|ped modestie often seemed to whip lest they should growe ouer wanton: no sooner was the inward beauties of the chamber discouered, but the worke wrought his wonder, and the wonder it selfe was equalled by the worke, for al the chast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Ladies of the world, inchased out of siluer, looking through faire mirrours of chrisolites, carbuncles, saphires &amp; greene Emeraults, fixed their eies on the picture of eternitie, which fixed on the toppes of a testerne, seemed with a golden trumpet to applaud to them al: in the tapistrie (beutified with gold, and pearle) were the nine Muses curiously wrought, who
<PB REF="7">
from a thicket beheld amorous <HI>Orpheus</HI> making the trees leape through his laments, and as he warbled his songs the flouds of <HI>Hebrus</HI> staied their sources; and the birds that be|held their comfort, began likewise to carrol. It was strange to thinke, and more strange to behold, in what order Art mat|ched with nature, and how the lymning painter had almost ex|ceeded nature in life, sauing that the beauteous faces wanted breath, to make them aliue, not cunning to proue them liuely. Thus was both the emperor and his daughter lodged, wan|ting neither delights of hunting, nor other princely plesures, to entertain them: so curious was the good olde man, in plea|sing his emperor and master. But among al other courtly de|lights <HI>Margarita</HI> met not the least, who in this castle found a companion to accompanie hir in life, and a chaste maide to at|tend her in loue, who (beside hir education, which was excel|lent, hir virtues such as equalled excellence, hir beauty so rare as exceeded both) was beloued by a noble lord of <HI>Moscouy,</HI> who for his singularities in poetry, &amp; science in feats of arms, was rather the seignior, then second of al the empire. The en|terchange of which affections was so conformable to the fan|cies of the princesse, that she, who was ordained to be the mi|racle of loue, learnd by them &amp; their maners the true methode of the same: for when <HI>Minecius</HI> courted his <HI>Philenia, Marga|rita</HI> conceited her <HI>Arsadachus</HI>; and by perceiuing the true heart of the one, supposed the perfect habite of the other. If at any time cause of discourtesie grew betwixt <HI>Philenia</HI> and her friend, <HI>Margarita</HI> salued it, hoping by that means to sacrifice to Loue, to gratifie him in her fortunes, which were to suc|ceede. How often would she make <HI>Minecius</HI> deserts excel|lent by her praise, and he his <HI>Philenia</HI> famous by his poetrie? It was a world to see in them, that when loue waxed warm, those louers waxed wittie, the one to command, the other to consent: if at any time <HI>Minecius</HI> wrote an amorous sonnet, <HI>Margarita</HI> should see it: and if at any time <HI>Margarita</HI> read a sonet she would commend it to satisfie <HI>Philenia,</HI> and in that <HI>Arsinous</HI> (the father through the good opinion of <HI>Protoma|chus</HI> the Emperour, thought not amisse of the marri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ge be|tweene his daughter and the <HI>Moscouite,</HI>) he rather furthered

This mourning passion pleased the ladies very highly, espe|cially <HI>Philenia,</HI> who thought her selfe no little blessed to bee thus beloued: among the rest they gaue this that follows his deserued commendation; for being written in the desolate sea|son of the yeare, and the desperate successe of his earnings, being so applied to his affects, and accordant with the yeares effects, (in my minde) deserueth in small good liking.</P>

And especially re|member these short lessons, which the shortnesse of time ma|keth me vtter by a word, where indeede they require a whole dayes worke; beware of ouer-trust, lest you commit the swee|test of your life to the credite of an vncertaine tongue. Use all such courtiers as visit you, in like manner as Goldsmiths do their mettall, who trie it by the touchstone if it be forthall, and melt it in the fire, before they vouchsafe it the fashion; so doe thou, and if they be counterfeit, they will soone leaue thee; if faithfull, they will the more loue thee. Trust not too much to the eare, for it beguileth many; nor to the tongue, for it be|witcheth more. Striue not with time in thy affaires, but take leasure; for a thing hastily enterprised, is more hastily repen|ted. In your counsailes, beware of too much affection: and in your actions be not too prowd, for the one will pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e your little regard of conscience; the other the corruption of your na|ture. And since thou art going into a forren court, and must follow the direction of a second father, whose fauour if thou keepe, thou maist hap to be most famous, looke to thy selfe, for as <HI>Plato</HI> saith; to be a king, and to raigne, to serue, and be in fauour; to fight, and ouercome, are three impossible things, and are onely distributed by fortune, and disturbes by her fro|wardnesse in following. Therefore (<HI>Protomachus</HI>) seeke in all things to follow his humour; for opinion is the chiefe step to preferment: and to be thought well of by the Prince, is no small profit; and if so be thou wilt please him, doe him many seruices, and giue him few words.

This Thebion being in high account with the Emperour for his ripe wit, was quickely entertained by this vngracious Prince for his cunning wickednesse; who where <HI>Arsadachus</HI> was prone by nature to doe ill, neuer cea|sed to minister him an occasion of doing ill.

<P><HI>Margarita</HI> ouerreading this sonet, supposed it to be some melancholie report of his prettie wanton discourses with her, whereupon she spake thus: <HI>Arsadachus</HI> were I the priest to confesse you, you should haue but small pennance; since in loue (as <HI>Philostratus</HI> saith) <HI>Cupid</HI> dispenseth with an oth, and words are good weapons to winne women, but if ei|ther of these haue defaulted in you, blush not, they shall be borne withal, for as the Mole hath foure feete and no eies; so a louer may be borne withall, for one maistaking among a many vertues: to be briefe as the Logicians say passion is no more but the effect of action, the one whereof I haue gathe|red in these lines, the other thou must shew in thy life: this said she ceased, and <HI>Philenia</HI> blushed. <HI>Minecius</HI> to cut off these mute melancholies of his mistresse gaue the dagger a new haft, turning ouer the leafe to a second discourse, mini|string <HI>Arsadachus</HI> by that meanes occasion to court <HI>Marga|rita,</HI> and himselfe opportunitie to pacifie <HI>Philenia,</HI> who by the carriage of her eie, shewed the discontent of her mind.

was not least sumptuous, for on that day hir apparel was so admirable, hir cariage &amp; behauior so execelent, that had the wisest <HI>Cato</HI> beheld her, he would haue in some parte dismis|sed his stoical seueritie: hir golden haires curled in rich knots, and enterlaced with rich bands of diamonds and rubies, see|med to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aine <HI>Apollos</HI> golden bush; enuirond with hir wreath of chrisolites, her eies like pure carbuncles, seemed to smile on the roses of her cheekes, which consorted with the beau|tie of the lillie, made her beutie more excelent, her eies, briars like the net of <HI>Vulcan,</HI> polished out of refined threeds of sine ebonie, her alablaster neck was encompassed with a coller of orient perle, which seemed to smile on her teeth when she ope|ned her mouth, claiming of them some consanguinitie; her bodie was apparrelled in a faire loose garment of greene da|maske, cut vpon cloth of tissue, and in euerie cut, was incha|sed a most curious Iewell, wherein al the escapes of <HI>Iupiter,</HI> the wanton delights of <HI>Venus,</HI> and the amorous deceits of <HI>Cupid</HI> were cunningly wrought. Thus attired, she atten|ded the bride, being hir selfe waited on by a troupe of beauti|full dainsels that day. <HI>Arsadachus,</HI> though with little deuo|tion accompanied the Emperour, being that day clothed in red cloth of golde, betokening reuenge. It were a vaine mat|ter to reckon vp the order of the bridegroome, the maiestie of his fauorers, the maner of the lords and ladies, the sumptu|ousnes of the feasts and triumphs, the harmonie and musicke in the temples; sufficeth it, that by the consent of <HI>Arcinous, Philenia</HI> was betrothed to <HI>Minecius,</HI> who seeing the day welnigh spent, &amp; the time conuenient to depart to his castell, (after he had with humble reuerence inuited the emperor, his daughter, with the other Princes the next day to his festiual,
<PB REF="14">
which he had prepared in his owne house) made all things in a readines, and departed, hauing receiued by the emperor and <HI>Arcinous,</HI> many rich rewards. <HI>Arsadachus</HI> seeing the long desired houre of his delights at hand, stole out of the courte in great secret to his lodging, where arming himselfe accord|ing as <HI>Thebion</HI> had giuen him instructions; and attended by <HI>Brasidas</HI> and other Cusca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, his trustie followers, he present|ly posted vnto a groue, thorow which the new married couple should needly passe, where he priuily hid himselfe and his am|bush. By that time the bright and glorious light of heauen, abasing himselfe by degrees, reposed his sweatie steedes in the soft bosome of cleere looking <HI>Eurotas</HI>; and euening the fore-messenger of the night had haled some starres to illumi|nate the hemisphere, when as <HI>Minecius</HI> (in the top of al his felicities) accompanied with his faire <HI>Philenia</HI> and other folo|wers, without either suspect of treason or other trouble entred the wood, and through the secretnesse thereof, hied them to|ward their determined abode. But al the way <HI>Philenia</HI> took no comfort, dreadfully suspecting the subtile dealings of <HI>Ar|sinous</HI>; and oft she sighed, and often she dropt downe lillies on the roses of her face, or rather, such sweete teares wherewith the blushing morne enchaseth the soft <HI>Hyacinth. Minecius</HI> seeing her in these passions, perswaded her vnto patience: but euen as (according to the opinion of <HI>Aristotle</HI>) lions, beares, eagles, griffins, and al other birds and beasts whatsoeuer, are then more egre and cruel when they haue yong ones: so <HI>Phi|lenia</HI> hauing now a second care annexed to her owne safetie, (which was for her deere husband) could not cease to perplexe her selfe, and to feare for him. Long had they not trauelled, but they discouered the ambush, and the ambush assaulted them: among which <HI>Arsadachus</HI> greatly disguised, as he that enuied the fortunes of <HI>Minecius,</HI> tooke holde on the reines of <HI>Phileniaes</HI> palfrey, whilest <HI>Thebion,</HI> and <HI>Brasidas,</HI> with o|thers, with their naked swordes beganne to assault <HI>Minecius</HI> and his followers. He that hath seene the faul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on seizing his keene talents in the flesh of a sillie doue, and playing his sharp bill on her soft feathers, might haue thought on <HI>Arsadachus,</HI> who no sooner tooke holde on her, but pulling the maske from

her face, enforced many violent kisses on her soft lips, whilest she exclaiming on the name of <HI>Minecius,</HI> and crying, help, re|pulsed the iniuries with her white hands, which were iniuri|ously offred to her delicate face. <HI>Minecius</HI> suspecting no more then was true, and vnable to endure further violence, deemed it greater honor to die in defence of his mistresse, then beholde the impeach of her credit, left his companions who fled, and with naked sword smote <HI>Arsadachus</HI> a mightie blowe on the helme, through which he staggered, and lost his hold-fast; then renewing his mistresse which was almost dead for feare, hee boldly spake thus to <HI>Arsadachus</HI>; Traitor, and coward, that in time of peace goest thus armed, and with vniust armes as|saultest naked knights, if any sparke of honor raigne in thee, giue me armes and weapons; if thou seek my life, take it from me with courage like a knight, not by treason like a coward; if my Loue, I pray thee take these eies from their sight, these handes from their sense, and this tongue from his speech: for whilest the one may see, the other fight, and the third threaten: thou shalt haue no part of that wherein my felicity is reposed; thus saying, he remounted <HI>Philenia</HI>: whilst he was thus oc|cupied, <HI>Arsadachus</HI> swelling with impatience after he had bin animated by his followers, replied thus: Soft (amorous sir) this is no meate for your mowing, you best were rather to fall to your prayers, then to vse prating, to beseech for life, then to seech loue: for assure thy selfe, there is no way with thee but death, nor no loue for <HI>Philenia</HI> but mine. This said, he gaue <HI>Minecius</HI> a mightie stroake on the head, so that the blood ouerflowed his costly attire, and he fell to the ground. <HI>Philenia</HI> halfe madde with melancholie, leapt from her pal|frey to comfort her paramour: and seeing the whole troope of assailants ready to charge her husband, and assured that <HI>Arsa|dachus</HI> was the chiefe of them, with such a piteous looke as <HI>Venus</HI> cast on bleeding <HI>Adonis</HI> shee behelde <HI>Minecius,</HI> and wiping his wounds with one hand, and touching the knees of <HI>Arsadachus</HI> with the other, she spake thus: Ah Cuscan prince though thy face is shadowed, I knowe thee by these follies, though thy raiments are changed, I iudge thee by thy rash|nesse, what seekest thou? if my fauour, it is already bequea|thed:
<PB REF="15">
if reuenge, how base is it against a woman? if <HI>Mine|cius</HI> life, how iniurious art thou to wrong him that loues thee as his life? Ah cruell as thou art (yet would thou wert not cruel) thou knowest <HI>Chrises</HI> teares could moue <HI>Achilles,</HI> the one proceeding from a seely maid, the other pitied by a prince|ly man: thou knowest that <HI>Alexander</HI> to <HI>Campaspe, Pom|pey</HI> to his prisouer, and other great conquerours haue rather shewed compassion then victorie; and wilt thou who art equall to all in power, be inferier to al in vertue? Ah wo is me poore <HI>Philenia</HI> that haue planted my affections there where they are watered with warme blood, and heape my compassion there where working teares haue no boote. I pray thee gra|cious prince, I pray thee be gracious: diuide not those by murther, whome the gods haue vnited by marriage: seperat not those soules by death whome the destinies haue appointed to liue. In speaking these words she beheld <HI>Minecius,</HI> who through the grieuousnesse of his wounds, fell in a swowne: wherevpon she casting off all care of life, and hope of comfort, closed her soft lippes to his, breathing the balme of her sighes into his breathlesse bodie, clapping his pale cheekes with her pretie hands, moisting his closed eies, with her christal teares, so that they who were the very authors of her sorow, gan sigh to see her ceremonies. Wilt thou hence (said she) <HI>Minecius?</HI> Oh stay for <HI>Philenia,</HI> let our soules post together to <HI>Elizium</HI> that on earth here may not enioy their happinesse; for nothing shall separate me from thee (my loue:) if thou do banish sight from thine eie, I will driue out blood from my heart: if thy beautie grow pale as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ying death, my cheekes shall pine as seeking death: if thou faint through feeblenesse of bodie, I will default through waightinesse of discontent: and since we may not liue together, we will die together. With this <HI>Mi|necius</HI> rowsed himselfe: and <HI>Arsadachus</HI> inflamed, replied; <HI>Philenia,</HI> there is no raunsome of thy husbands life, but thy loue, nor no meanes to pacifie me, but my pleasure of thee: speake therefore, and sound the sentence of my delight, or <HI>Mi|necius</HI> destruction: which said, he approched to kisse hir: whom <HI>Minecius</HI> though halfe dead beganne to rescue: and <HI>Philenia</HI> halfe bedlam enforced her selfe in these termes: Traitor di|sloyall
<PB REF="16">
and damned leacher, since neither teares, nor tearmes will satisfie thee, vse thy tyranny (for better were it for me to be buried with honor, then bedded with infamie) do therefore thy worst, thou hated of the gods, and despised among men, for no sooner shalt thou assaile my husband, but thou shalt slaie me: each drop of his blood shall be doubled by mine: and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s in life he should haue beene the shelter of mine honor, so e|uen in death wil I be the shield to defend him fro~ the assaults of his enemies: come therefore ye murtherers, in growing cruel to me, you wil proue pitiful: first take my life, that <HI>Mi|necius</HI>
beholding my constancie, may die with more comfort. Thus cried she out with many teares; and <HI>Minecius</HI> disswa|ded her. But the time passing away, and <HI>Arsadachus</HI> fearing delaies, seeing all hope lost, grew to desperate furie, so that animating his followers, they set on <HI>Minecius,</HI> who valiant|ly defended himselfe. It was a world to see, how during the conflict <HI>Philenia</HI> bestirred her, letting no blow slip without the warde of her body, lying betweene the sword of the enemy for her husbands safetie, crying out on the heauens til she was wellnie hoarse with crying. At last <HI>Minecius</HI> lacking blood, <HI>Philenia</HI> breath, both of them entangled arme in arme, fell downe dead, leauing the memorie of their vertues to be eter|nized in all ages. <HI>Arsadachus</HI> seeing the tragedies perfour|med (not without some sighs which compassion extorted from him, as strokes do fire out of hard flint: he presently sent <HI>Bra|sidas</HI> away, as it was concluded (attended by those Cuscans that followed him in the enterprise) and hee with <HI>Thebio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> speedily posted to their lodging, both vndiscouered and vnsus|pected.</P>
<P>By this, such as attended <HI>Minecius</HI> to his castle had with speedy flight entred the court of <HI>Arsinous</HI>; who certified of his daughters danger, aduised the emperour, and presently with certaine armed souldiers, posted on to the rescouse: meane while <HI>Protomachus</HI> made search through al the court for such as were absent; and they that were appointed to the action entring <HI>Arsadachus</HI> chamber, found him in his foxe sleepe: where-through the emperour being aduertised, gan little sus|pect him: in like sor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> found they <HI>Thebion,</HI> only <HI>Brasidas</HI> was

missing. In the meane while <HI>Arsinous</HI> hauing attained the place of the conflict, found both the murthered bodies swelte|red in their blouds: whereupon falling from his horse in great furie, he thus exclaimed on fortune. Oh fortune, wel art thou called, the enemie of vertue, since thou neither fauourest such as deserue wel, nor destroyest those that performe ill&punc; for hadst thou not beene partiall, my daughters chastitie had preuented her death, and her murtherers crueltie had beene their owne confusion: woe is me that haue lost my floure in the bud, my hope in the eare, and my haruest in the blossome. Ah my deere <HI>Philenia,</HI> deare wert thou to me, that bought thee with much care, and haue lost thee with more: deere wert thou vnto me, who hast cost me many broken sleepes to bring thee vp, many carefull thoughts to bestow thee, more fatherly teares to pre|uent thy ouerthrow, and now hauing reared the fortresse of my delights, the tempest of iniurious fortune hath destroyed it: wo is me that am carefull to publish my paines, and negligent to seeke remedy; fond am I to defie fortune from whom I can|not flie: ah <HI>Arsinous</HI> weepe not her that may not be recal|led with teares, but seeke to reuenge her; shew thy selfe ra|ther fatherly in act, then effeminate in teares? Which said, he gouerned himselfe, causing the dead bodies honorably to be couered and conueied with him to his castle, where within a temple erected to chastitie, hee reared a faire tombe of white marble, wherein with the generall teares of the emperour and his whole court, these two faithful louers were entombed, and ouer their graues thus written:
<Q><LG>
<L>Vertue is dead, and here she is enshrined,</L>
<L>Within two lifelesse bodies late deceased:</L>
<L>Beautie is dead, and here is faith assigned</L>
<L>To weepe her wracke, who when these dide first ceased.</L>

<P>This register of his loue did <HI>Arsinous</HI> with many teares write <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pon the toobme of his deceased sonne in law &amp; daugh|ter, who had no sooner furnished the funeralles, but <HI>Phidias</HI> a page of <HI>Philenias,</HI> who during the mortall debate, &amp; blou|dy massacre, had hid himself in a thicket, and ouerheard the whole discourse of <HI>Arsadachus,</HI> repaired to the court, who calling <HI>Arsinous</HI> aside, with pitious teares discoursed vnto him the whole tragedy in such ruthfull manner, as that it was hard to say, whether the lad in bewraying it, or the father in hearing it, were more compassionate. The old man certified the truth, though scarce able, yet smothered his griefes, till o|portunitie offered, suffering the emperour (like a wise man) to follow his owne course, who the next morning assembling his nobilitie, forgot not <HI>Arsadachus,</HI> who making semblance to haue but new inteligence of the murther of <HI>Minecius</HI> &amp; his loue, repaired to the Court in mourning apparrell and being present when the matter was debated, seemed to weepe bit|terlie, crying out on the emperour for Iustice, exclaiming on the iniquitie of time, the crueltie of men, and tyrany of loue. <HI>Protomachus</HI> was not a little pleased herewith, neither was <HI>Margarita</HI> aggreeued to heare it, but <HI>Arsinous</HI> boyled in choler to see it: at last it was found out, by a scarfe which <HI>Bra|sidas</HI> had let fall (and was after taken vp by one of those who fled) that he was at the murther, whereupon his absence was sufficient to conuic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> him, and <HI>Arsadachus</HI> called forth to an|swere for him in that he was his attendant, spake thus: No|ble emperor, the gods that haue placed thee in thy kingdome, shal beare me witnes, how I grieue this accident, &amp; willingly would reuenge it, and since my follower to my defame, hath (as it is supposed) bin a principall, vouchsafe me noble empe|rour

licence for a time to depart to <HI>Cusco,</HI> where I will both discharge my choller, purge my griefe, and be so reuenged of <HI>Brasidas</HI> (who as I heare is fled, and by the token is guilty) as all the world shall ring of the iustice, and ridde me of suspi|tion. The emperour not hearing one that dared say his let|ters should suffice, endeuouring himselfe to seeke the confede|rates; and because by his lookes he perceiued some discontents in <HI>Arsadachus,</HI> he sought al the means he could to please him, and remembring himselfe (that those good deeds which are done to our self beloued, are esteemed as to our selfe) he high|ly promoted <HI>Thebion,</HI> thinking thereby to winne the heart of <HI>Arsadachus,</HI> so that he pretermitted no consultations, where <HI>Thebion</HI> was not chiefe, neither bestowed benefits, wherein he had no part. The yong prince measuring al this according to the corrption of his nature, supposed these fauors were but to sound him, and that <HI>Thebion</HI> being wonne by benefits, would easily consent to bewray him, whereupon he conceiued a deadly hate against him, and perseuered it so long till he ef|fected it in this maner to his death: For knowing that <HI>Mar|garita</HI> deerely loued him, ayming all her fashions to his fan|cies, hir behauiours, to his humors, he began anew to cloake with her, shewing her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o vndoubted signes of assured affecti|on, that she seemed in a paradise of pleasure, to see his pliant|nes, and hauing with sweete words, trained her to his lewer, he attended such an occasion, as that he found her alone wal|king in the priuie garden in her meditations, (for those that loue much, meditate oft) where nying her with a courtly sa|lute; he thus found her affection: Faire Princesse, if either my vnfained loue haue any force, or your vertuous nature true compassion, I hope both my sorrowes shal be pittied, and my discontents succored. Why what aggreeueth my deere Lord said <HI>Margarita</HI>? (and heartily she sighed in saying so) is ei|ther our court vnpleasant, our entertainement vnworthie, our ladies vnapt to worke your delights&punc; beleeue me good prince, if Mosco cannot suffice to please you, <HI>Europe</HI> and the worlde shall be sought to satisfie you.

<PB REF="18">
me, I shall be heades man, to pray for your happinesse, and rest yours vnfained in all seruice and loyaltie. <HI>Margarita</HI> hauing gotten such an oportunitie to please him both vowed and reuowed all secrecie, swearing although it were with the hasard of hir life to do whatsoeuer him best liked, and conceale whatso it please him to discouer, so great is the simplicitie of women, who are soone led where they most like. <HI>Arsadachus</HI> finding the iron hot, thought good to strike; the fruit ripe, be|gan to gather, the floure springing, ceased not to water: and thus began to worke her. True it is madam, that where loue hath supremacie, all other affections attend on it, so that nei|ther the eie beholdeth, neither the sent smelleth, nor the eare heareth, neither the tongue speaketh any thing, but is to the honour of the best beloued: this finde I true in my selfe, who since I surrendred you the sort of my fancie, finde my de|lights metamorphosed into yours, ye so much am I tied vn|to you, as that danger which either attempteth or toucheth you, or any of yours, wholly attainteth me. The proofe wher|of you may perceiue in this, that hauing heard through my intire acquaintance with <HI>Thebion,</HI> a certaine resolued deter|mination in him, to make your father away, by reason of his familiar accesse to his maiestie euerie morning, I could not choose but discouer his drift vnto you sweete Princesse, whose dangers must needely second your fathers subuersion. <HI>The|bion</HI> said <HI>Margarita,</HI> alas my lord what reason should moue him hereunto, since no one is more fauoured by my father then he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> can fauour possibly be requited with such falshood? Doubt you it said <HI>Arsadachus</HI>&punc; why madam where is greater treason, then there where is least mistrust? vnder the cleare Christ all lurketh the mortall worme, vnder the greene leafe the greedie serpent, and in fairest bosomes are falcest hearts. Thinke not that liberallitie hath any power in depraued minds, for whereas the thoughts hant after emperie, hem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> are each supposes, faith dieth, truth is exiled <HI>nulla fides reg|ni,</HI> if you haue read histories, you shall finde that they soonest haue supplanted their Princes, who haue bin least suspected, as may appeare by <HI>Giges,</HI> and other: cast therefore hence (my deare ladie) all thought of excuse, and bethinke you of preuen|tion;
<PB REF="18">
for it is greater wisedome, to see and preuent, then to heare and neglect. <HI>Thebion</HI> hath conspired and doth conspire, resoluing with himselfe to vsurp the empire, murther <HI>Proto|machus,</HI> banish you; all which I haue learned of him, dissem|bling my affections towards you, and soothing him in his cor|ruptions; yea so farre haue I brought him, and so neere haue I wrought it, that I can assure you to morrow morning is the last of your fathers life, vnlesse you preuent it. Alas my lord (said <HI>Margarita</HI> weeping) how may this be? Thus my sweete loue and thus it is concluded (quoth <HI>Arsadachus</HI>) you know he hath euerie morning of late priuate accesse vnto your fathers chamber, where being alone with him and the vnsus|pected emperour in his bed, he hath resolued with his dagger to stabbe him to the heart; which secret, since the gods haue opened vnto me, I think good to discouer vnto thee (my deere heart) the meanes to preuent (which shall the more easily be performed if thus you worke it) no sooner let the day appeare, but in the morning betimes enter you your fathers chamber, where after you haue saluted him, you may seeme to vtter this; that in a dreame this night you were mightily troubled about his Maiestie, and so troubled, that you thought <HI>The|bion</HI> entring his chamber with a hidden poiniard stabbed him to the heart. But what needes these circumlocutions or de|laies quoth <HI>Margarita</HI> if the treason be so manifest? My lord, if it please you I will discouer it presently and plainely. The gods forbid (said <HI>Arsadachus</HI>) that my desires should be so hindered, for (my noble princesse) the delay I seeke, and the order I prescribe you, is rather to ground your fathers affec|tion towards me, and get the credite of this seruice then other|wise; yea the loue I beare thee sweete Ladie; (with that hee sighed and sealed it with a kisse) for hauing by this meanes wonne fauour, both our fortunes shall be bettered, our marri|age hasted, and our fames magnified.</P>
<P><HI>Margarita</HI> (poore princesse) supposing all that golde that glistered, yeelded easie consent; whereupon after many amo|rous promises, the yong prince tooke his leaue, willing her to be carefull in the morning, and to leaue the rest of the affaires to his faithfulnesse, and thus they parted.</P>
<P><PB REF="19">But marke the nature of malice (which as the poet descri|beth is sleepelesse, restlesse and in satiate) for <HI>Arsadachus</HI> being departed from <HI>Margarita,</HI> and earnestly bent on his reuenge, sought out <HI>Thasilides</HI> the page of <HI>Thebion,</HI> whom he so cun|ningly wrought with othes, gifts, and gold, that he made him both promise and practise the meanes to put a certaine scedule into the pocket of his masters gowne which he vsually ware, the which he himselfe had wrote, and wherein he behaued him selfe with such art, as that he had not only counterfeted <HI>The|bions</HI> hand, but also the names of al such as either he thought his fauorites, or else likely to thwart his proceedings in court (among which hee forgote not <HI>Ctesides</HI> a graue counseller of the emperors, who the day before was very earnest with <HI>Pro|tomacus</HI> to marry his daughter, shewing him euident reasons of <HI>Arsadachus</HI> counterfeiting. All these things falling out according to his own deuise and fantasie, he sought out <HI>The|bion</HI> that night, whom he vsed with the greatest familiaritie that might be: and to insinuate the more into his fauour, hee bestowed on him a poiniard, whose pummel was a bright car|buncle, the haft vnicorns horne, a iewell which <HI>Thebion</HI> had long time greatly desired, praying him of all loues to weare it for his sake; and since he was in such estimation to continue him in the good grace of the Emperour. <HI>Thebion</HI> made proud to be intreated and presented by so high a prince, promi|sed both to weare his gift, and to winne him fauour. Where|vpon since the night was farre spent <HI>Arsadachus</HI> repaired to his lodging, <HI>Thebion</HI> to his rest. But vaine is the hope that dependeth on the next day, and those worldly honours that doe wait on this life; for the one is preuented oftentimes by iniu|rious fortune, the other altered by our ouerweening mistrust|ing words, actions, and desires, and shall manifestly appeare in the sequell of this historie. For no sooner gan bright day to chase away blacke darkenesse, and the stooping stares doe ho|mage to the rising sunne, but <HI>Margarita</HI> arose, apparelling herselfe freshly like Maie, in a gowne of greene sendall, em|brodered with all kind of floures in their natiue colours, and remembring her selfe of the affaire she had in hand; she vnder the conduct of loue (who is both a cunning dissembler and nice

flatterer) hasted to her fathers chamber, and humbly admitted to the presence of the emperour by the groomes that attended him, (with a trembling hand, and a bashfull c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">untenaunce: spreading the mute oratorie of her teares, vppon her blushing cheekes) she awoke him. <HI>Protomachus</HI> amased to see his daughters sodaine accesse, and sad countenance, began thus: How now my deere <HI>Margarita,</HI> what, hath loue awaked you this morning, threatning you with some apparant sorrow to make your after-good in deede more sauourie? why hangeth your countenance? why tremble your limmes? what moueth this your amasednes? sweete maiden tell thy father. Ah my Lord (said <HI>Margarita</HI>) it is loue indeede that disturbes mee, but not that loue that is painted with feathers, wanton looks, that loue that whispereth affections in ladies eares, and whet|teth womens wittes, making the eie traitor to the heart, and the heart betrothed to the eie; but that loue which was ingen|dred by nature, ordained by the heauens, attired by reuerence and duetie, and tired with nothing but death, that loue (and so speaking she wept) hath awaked me, to forewarne you. <HI>Protomachus</HI> somewhat vrged by these teares, rowzed him|selfe on his pillow, and began more intentiuely to listen, ask|ing her what had hapnes? Ah deare father, said she, this night that is past I was greatly troubled with a grieuous dreame; me thought I saw <HI>Thebion,</HI> a man in high authoritie in your court, attended by many insolent rebels, who violently brake open your maiesties priuie chamber, murthered you in your bed, and dispossest me of my heritage, me thought euen then you cried vnto me; ah <HI>Margarita</HI> help me! and I with out|cries calling for rescouse, <HI>Arsadachus</HI> came in hastily, who with his sword berest <HI>Thebion</HI> of life, and me of feare: And so you waked and found all false (quoth the emperour) Tut, doate not on dreames, they are but fancies: and since I see (swe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">te daughter) that you are so troubled by night, I will shortly find out a yong prince to watch you, who shall driue a|way these night-sprights by his prowesse.

<P>No sooner were these discourses finished, but <HI>Arsadachus</HI>
<PB REF="20">
knowing how to take his time, hastily approched the Empe|rors chamber, where intimating some occasion of high import, he required to speake with <HI>Protomachus,</HI> and was presently let in. The Emperour conceiuing new suspitions vpon this second assault, beganne to misdeeme: and seeing <HI>Arsadachus</HI> with gastly lookes entring the chamber, was ready to speake vnto him when as the yong Cuscan preuented him, saying: The gods be blessed (noble Emperor) that haue by their fore|sight rid me of feare, and rest you of danger; for sore haue I feared lest your maiestie should haue perished before you had beene aduertised: Alas, why in such dangers are you vnatten|ded vpon, when the foe is at the doore? why is not the guard in a readinesse? Ah royall Moscouite rowze thee and arise, and honour the sequele of the greatest treason that euer was con|triued. Why what tidings bringeth <HI>Arsadachus</HI> said <HI>Proto|machus</HI>? Thus mighty prince (said he) yesternight very late when I entred <HI>Thebions</HI> chamber vnawares, I found his page (his master being absent) laying certaine waste papers out of his pocket vpon his table, perusing which, (as I was accustomed) by reason of the neere familiarity betweene vs, I found one among the rest where (alas that subiects should be so seditious) there was a conspiracy signed by <HI>Thebion, Cte|sides,</HI> and others (whose names I remember not) to make your mightinesse away, and <HI>Thebion</HI> to enioy the crowne: the maner to execute their stratageme, was when you least suspe|cted, this morning; at which time <HI>Thebion</HI> by reason of his neere familiaritie and accesse to you, should enter your cham|ber and murther you. This paper when I had ouer-read, I laide aside, making semblance of no suspition, resoluing this morning early to signifie the whole vnto your maiestie, whose life is my libertie, whose happines is my honour, whose death were my vtter ruine and detriment. <HI>Thebion</HI> a traitor quoth <HI>Protomachus</HI>; are my fauours then so smally regarded? is my curtesie rewarded with such cursednesse? Well <HI>Arsada|chus</HI> (said he) happy art thou in bewraying it, and vnfortunate he and his confederates in attempting it, for they all shal die.</P>
<P>This saide, he presently attired himselfe, laying certaine of his trustiest gentlemen in guard behinde the tapistrie of his
<PB REF="20">
priuy closet, expecting the houre of a most cruell reuenge: when as sodainely <HI>Thebion</HI> knocked at the doore, and was presently admitted, who had scarcely said, God saue the em|perour, but euen in the bending of his knees, hee was thrust through by <HI>Arsadachus,</HI> and the other of the guard hearing the broile, came and mangled him in peeces, casting the resi|due to the Emperours lions according as hee had appointed. <HI>Protomachus</HI> grudging at the sodaine death of <HI>Thebion,</HI> be|gan to chide <HI>Arsadachus</HI> for his haste, saying, that it was in|conuenient for a subiect to be punished before hee were conuic|ted. Conuicted (said <HI>Arsadachus?</HI> why doth your grace sus|pect his guiltinesse? Beholde saide hee (drawing out the poinyard which <HI>Thebion</HI> had at his back) the instrume~t that should haue slaine you, see (saide hee) taking the schedule out of his pocket the confederacie to betray you; and should such a wretch liue then to iustifie? No (mightie Emperour) my soule abhorres it; the care I haue of you will not suffer it; the loue I beare <HI>Margarita</HI> will not indure it. The Emperour ouer-reading the writing, and seeing the poinyard, gaue cre|dible beleefe, and with teares of ioy imbracing <HI>Arsadachus</HI> he said thus: Ah my sonne, the gods haue blessed vs in sending vs such a friend, who hath saued mee from imminent danger, and will make me fortunate by marriage, hold take thee (said he) my <HI>Margarita,</HI> and with her, enioy my empire; and more, take thou my loue, which is so rooted in me toward thee, that death may not vntwine it. <HI>Arsadachus</HI> thanked the Empe|rour for this fauour, and recomforted <HI>Margarita</HI> with sweete words, being almost dead to see the stratageme passed. Meane while the Emperour gaue present direction to hang all the o|ther conspirators, and put them to other tortures, who pre|sently without knowing why, or licence to answere, were ty|rannously executed; so great is the tyranny of princes which are subiect to light beliefe, and led by subtil suggestions.</P>
<P>The rumour of this accident spread through the Court, moued sundry imaginations in mens minds, some praised <HI>Ar|sadachus,</HI> some suspected the practise, all feared; for whereas iustice sleepeth being ouerborne with tyranny, the most secure haue cause to feare; among the rest <HI>Arsinous</HI> wept bitterly,
<PB REF="21">
knowing in himselfe the vertue of <HI>Ctesides,</HI> and remembring him of the murther of his deere <HI>Philenia,</HI> hee could not cease but welme bedlam to crie out on the heauens, whose tragedie we must now prosecute, and leaue <HI>Arsadachus</HI> and his <HI>Mar|garita</HI> to their mery conceits and discourses.</P>
<P><HI>Protomachus</HI> after that this late treason had beene disco|uered, beganne to be more warie, to keepe greater guard, and to vse <HI>Arsinous</HI> and the rest of the nobilitie with lesse familia|ritie, who good old man, hauing before time beene shrewdly hurt, tooke this vnkindenesse to the heart (for where greatest loue is, there vnkindenesse is most grieuous) for that cause al|most desperate he sought out the emperour, and finding op|portunitie, he humbling him on his knees beganne thus: As <HI>Traiane</HI> (dread Monarch) was commended in Rome for bearing poore mens complaints, so art thou condemned in Mosco for shutting thy gates against all kind of sutors, so as (nowadayes) thou hearest by others eares, workest by others hands, and speakest by others mouthes, where-through iu|stice is made a nose of waxe warmed, and wrought according to all mens pleasures, and the poore are left to complaine: the which the gods (if thou repent not) wil shortly punish in thee. Beleeue me (good Emperour) such as shut their gates a|gainst their subiects, cause them not to open their hearts wil|lingly to obey them; and they that norish feare in their bosoms without cause, make themselues guilty of some crime by their suspect.

That iustice becommeth thee, marke these rea|sons: <HI>Homer</HI> desirous to exalt it, could not say more, but to call kings the children of the God&punc; <HI>Iupiter,</HI> and not for the na|turalitie they haue, but for the office of iustice which they mi|nister. <HI>Plato</HI> saieth, that the chiefest gift that the gods haue bestowed on man is iustice; that therefore thou may seeme <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ightly descended of the gods, vouchsafe me audience, and to

Three moneths are past, since thou hast made inquirie of my daughters death, and she that I nourished vp twentie yeares and better, is forgotten of all, but her olde father, lamented of none, but <HI>Arsinous:</HI> and can be reuenged by none but <HI>Proto|machus.</HI> O Emperour I heare their discontented griefe cry|ing out in mine eares, and appealing to thee by my tongue for iustice, me thinkes bloudlesse <HI>Minecius</HI> standeth by thy throne vpbraiding thee of his seruices, and conuicting thee of ingratitude. <HI>Philenia</HI> crieth iustice <HI>Protomachus,</HI> iustice, not against <HI>Brasidas,</HI> who was but agent, but against <HI>Arsa|dachus</HI> the principall, that wretched <HI>Arsadachus,</HI> who in her life time assaied to moue her to lust, and wrought her death, in that she would not consent to his lust, against <HI>Arsadachus</HI> the viper nourished in your bosome, to poison your owne proge|nie, the locust&punc; dallied in <HI>Margaritaes</HI> lap, to depriue her of life. Ah, banish such a bewitched race of the Cuscans, I meane not out of your kingdome, but out of life; for he deser|ueth not to beholde the heauens, that conspireth against the gods, root out that bloodthirsty yongman, root out that mur|therer, roote out that monster, from the face of nature, that the poore deceased ghostes may be appeased, and their poore father pacified. Shew thy selfe a prince now <HI>Protomachus</HI>; the surgeon is knowen, not in curing a greene wound, but in healing a grieuous fistula; the warriour is knowne, not by conquering alittle village, but a great monarchie, and a prince is perceiued in preuenting a capitall pestilence, not a priuate preiudice. That I accuse not <HI>Arsadachus</HI> wrongfully, be|hold my witnesses: which saide, he brought out <HI>Phileniaes</HI> page, who confidently and constantly auowed all he had told his master in the presence of the emperour: wherefore (noble monarch) haue compassion of me, and by punishing this tra|gicke
<PB REF="22">
tyranny make way to thine owne eternitie.</P>
<P><HI>Protomachus</HI> hearing this accusation was sorely moued, now thinking all trueth which <HI>Arsinous</HI> had said by reason of that vertue he had approued in him in times past, now deem|ing it false, in that <HI>Arsadachus</HI> (as he supposed) had lately and so luckily preserued him from death. For which cause, calling the yong prince vnto him, he vrged him with the mur|ther before the old man, and the yoong ladde his accuser, who shooke off al their obiections with such constancie, that it was to be wondered: what saith he <HI>Protomachus,</HI> am I, who haue lately manifested my zeale in sauing your life made subiect to the detraction of an old doting imagination with his pratling minister, I hope your Maiestie (saith he) measureth not my credit so barely, nor wil ouerslip this iniurie so slightly, since you know, that when the murder was done I was in my bed, when the tragedie was published, I was the first that prose|cuted the reuenge; and more, the friendship twixt <HI>Minecius</HI> and me should acquit me of this suspition. But it may be, that this is some set match of <HI>Thebions</HI> confederates that seeke my death, which if it shall be heere countenaunced, I will returne to Cusco, where I dare assure my selfe against al such subtilties. This said, <HI>Arsadachus</HI> angerly departed: for which cause, <HI>Protomachus</HI> fearing his speedy flight, sent <HI>Margarita</HI> to pacifie him; and causing the tongue of the guilt|lesse lad to be cut out, and his eies to be prickt out with nee|dles, both which were guiltie (as he said) the one of preten|ded seeing, the other of lewd vttering. He banished the olde Duke of Uolgradia, who for all his faithfull seruices, had this lamentable recompence, and remoued himself, his court, and daughter to Mosco, where wee will leaue him a while.</P>
<P><HI>Arsinous</HI> thus banished from the Court, after he had fur|nished himselfe of necessaries conuenient for his iourney, tra|uelled many a weary walke towards the desarts of Ruscia, crying out and exclaiming on the heauens for iustice; his hoa|rie lockes and bushy beard he carelesly suffered to grow (like to those Moscoes who are in disgrace with their emperors) seeming rather<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> sauage man than a ciuile magistrate (as in time past he had beene.) Long had hee not trauelled among

many barren rockes and desolate mountaines, but at last hee arriued in a sollitarie Groue encompassed with huge hilles, from the toppes whereof, through the continuall frosts that fell, a huge riuer descended, which circling about a rocke of white marble, made it (as it were) an Island, but that to the northward there was a pretie passage of twelue foote broade, deckt with ranks of trees, which gaue a solitary accesse to the melancholie mansion; mansion I call it, for in the huge rocke was there cut out a square and curious chamber, with fine loopes to yeeld light, hewen thereout (as might be supposed) by some discontented wood-god wedded to wretchednesse. Here <HI>Arsinous</HI> seated himselfe, resoluing to spend the residue of his dayes in studies, praying to the gods continually for re|uenge, and to the end (if happily any shoulde passe that way) that his deepe sorrow might be discouered, he with a punchion of steele in a table of white Alablaster engraued this ouer the entrance of his caue.</P>

<P>In this solitarie and vncouth receptacle, <HI>Arsinous</HI> liued, turning of his steede, to shift for foode amid the forest, and as|sending euerie day to the height of the rocke, hee shed manie salte teares before the Image of <HI>Minecius</HI> and <HI>Philenia,</HI> whose pictures he had brought with him from his castell, and erected there: and after his deuotions to the gods for reuenge, and to the ghosts to manifest his grief, he accustomed himself to walke in that desolate coppesse of wood, where sighing, he recounted the vnkindnes of his prince, the wretchednes of his thoughts and life, melting away in such melancholie, as the trees were amased to beholde it, and the rockes wept their springs to heare it, as the Poet saith, on a desolate and leaue|lesse oake he wrote this:

Thither also repaired all the faire ladies of <HI>Moscouia</HI>; among the rest <HI>Margarita</HI> as one of most reckoning, made not the least ex|pence, for whatsoeuer, either to dignifie hir person, or to set out her beautie, or to present her beloued, could either be bought from <HI>India,</HI> trafficked in <HI>Europe</HI> or marchanded in <HI>Asia,</HI> was sought out, and especially against the day of the tilt, and tur|ny, at which time, like a second <HI>Diana,</HI> hauing her goldilocks tied vp with loose chaines of gold, and Diamondes, her bodie apparreled in cloth of siluer, (ouer which she had cast a vaile of blacke and golden tinsell, through which her beautie appeared as doth the bright <HI>Phoebus</HI> in a summers morning: leauing our Hemisphere our faire <HI>Hecate,</HI> chasing away balefull darkenesse with her bright beames) shee was mounted on a high arch of triumph couered with cloth of golde: neare vnto her sate her olde father in his soueraigne maiestie; about her a hundreth damselles in white cloth of tissue, ouer-cast with a vaile of purple and greene silke loosly woue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, carrying gold and siluer censors in their hands, from whence issued most pleasant odours, such as in the pride of the yeare breath along the coast of <HI>Arabia Foelix</HI> or drops from the balmie trees of the East.</P>
<P>Thus seated, the Challengers with their seuerall deuises entred the tilt-yard, each striuing to exceede other in expence and excellence; whose trumpets cleered the aire with their me|lodie. After these the Defendants entred; among whom <HI>Ar|sadachus</HI> was chiefe, whose pump in that, exceeded al others I haue seene, and the other are ordinarily matched in our Courts of christendome, I will set downe vnto you. First, before the triumph entred the tilt-yard, there was a whole vo|lie of a hundred cannons shot off; the noise whereof somewhat appeased <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> hundred knights hauing their horse, armes, crests,
<PB REF="24">
fethers, and each part of them couered with greene cloth of golde, with lances of siluer, tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tted about the yard, making their steedes keepe footing, according to the melodious sound of an orbe, which by cunning of man, and wonderfull art was brought into the presence of the prince, which whilst it conti|nually turned, presented all the shapes of the twelue signes, dauncing as it were to the harmonie, which the inclosed mu|sicke presented them. After these marched a hundred pages apparelled in white cloth of siluer with crownets of siluer on their heads, leading each of them in their right hands, a braue courser trapped in a caparison purple and gold; in their left, a scutchion with the image of the princesse in the same. After these <HI>Arsadachus</HI> in his triumphant chariot drawen by foure white unicornes entred the tilt-yard, vnder his seate the image of fortune, which he seemed to spurne, with this posie, <HI>Quid haec</HI>? on his right hand enuy, whom he frowned on by hir this posie, <HI>Nec haec</HI>; on his left hand the portraiture of <HI>Cupid,</HI> by whome was written this posie, <HI>Si hic</HI>; ouer his head the pic|ture of <HI>Margarita</HI> with this mot, <HI>Sola haec.</HI> These armes were of beaten golde far more curious then those that <HI>Thetis</HI> gaue hir <HI>Achilles</HI> before <HI>Troy</HI> or <HI>Meriones</HI> bestowed on <HI>V|lysses</HI> when he assaulted <HI>Rhesus,</HI> being full of flames and half moones of saphires, chrisolites, and diamonds.

In this sort he presented him before the Emperour and his daughter, who was not alittle tickled with delight to behold the excel|lencie of his triumph. The trumpets were sounded, and the Iudges seated, <HI>Arsadachus</HI> mounted himselfe on a second <HI>Eucephalus,</HI> and taking a strong lance ouerbore <HI>Stilconos</HI> the earle of <HI>Garania,</HI> breaking his arme in the fall; in the second encounter he ouerthrew <HI>Asaphus</HI> of <HI>Tamir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e</HI> horse and man, neither ceased hee till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. of the brauest men at armes were vnhorsed by his hardinesse.

<P>The third day being ended, and the honours bestowed on them that best deserued them: the emperour in the chiefest of the festiuall caused the tables to be remoued, and the musicke to be called for; thinking by his meanes to giue loue more fuell, in hope it should burne more brighter: whereuppon the princes betooke them to daunce; and <HI>Arsadachus</HI> as chiefe, led <HI>Margarita</HI> the measures. And after the first pawse began thus with her; Princesse said he, by what means might loue be discouered if speech were not: By the eies (my lord said she) which are the keys of desire, which both open the way for loue to enter, and locke him vp when he is let in.

Why sticketh he his eie in their hearts? I had thought (madam) it had beene his arrow said <HI>Arsadachus.</HI> Why his eies are his arrowes, quoth the princesse, (or I mi|stake his shooting;) for the last time he leuelled at mee he hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> me with a looke. I beshrew him (saide the Prince) and then sounded the next measure, when <HI>Arsadachus</HI> continued his discourse in this manner: Madam, if loue wound by the eie, how healeth he? By the eie (my lord said she) hauing the ma|pertie of <HI>Achill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> sword to quell and recure. Then gracious lady quoth the prince, since loue hath wounded mee by your lookes, let them recouer mee, otherwise shall I blame both loues crueltie, and your iudgement. <HI>Margarita</HI> replied thus: Great prince, if mine eies haue procured your offence, I will plucke them out for their follie; and if loue haue shot them for

Why doth not <HI>Arsadachus</HI> smile on mee? as who knoweth not that the aspis tickleth when she pricketh; and poisons that are delightfull in the swallow, are deadly in the stomach: why hath be not courted me these fiue moneths: fond that I am, the more neare am I to my fall; for as the philosopher faith, men are like to the poison of scorpions, for as the sting of the one killeth in three dayes, so the pride and crueltie of the other quelleth a kinde heart in lesse then a mo|ment. Woe is me, I had rather neede <HI>Philoxenus</HI> to cure me of loue by his laies, then <HI>Anippus</HI> to continue loue in me: better were it for me to heare <HI>Tripander</HI> play then <HI>Arsada|chus</HI>

<P>(In these thoughts and this speech loue sealed vp her eies till on the morrow; but what she dreamed I leaue that to you Ladies to decide, who hauing dallied with loue, haue likewise beene acquainted with his dreames.) On the morrow, the day being farre spent, and the court replenished with attendants, <HI>Margarita</HI> arose, and scarcely was shee attired, but that a messenger came vnto her in the behalfe of the earle <HI>Asaphus.</HI> beseeching her presence to grace his feast that day, for that he had entertained and inuited <HI>Arsadachus</HI> and the best princes and ladies in Court, by the Emperours consent, to make a merry festiuall; whereunto <HI>Margarita</HI> quickly condescended, and thought euery houre two till noonetide; at which time cor|dially attended, she repaired to <HI>Asaphus</HI> house, where were assembled, of princes, <HI>Arsadachus, Plicotus,</HI> and <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lconos</HI>; of ladies, beside her selfe, <HI>Calandra, Ephania,</HI> and <HI>Gerenia:</HI> all these <HI>Asaphus</HI> entertained heartily, placing them accord|ing to their degrees, and feasted them with as great pompe and pleasure as he could imagine.</P>
<P>But when he perceiued their appetites quelled with de|lights, their eares cloyed with musicke, and their eies filled with beholding, he being a Prince of high spirit, began thus: Princes and Ladies, I haue inuited you to my house, not to entertaine you with the pompe of <HI>Persia,</HI> or the feast of <HI>Heli|ogabalus,</HI>
<PB REF="26">
but to dine you according to the the directio~ of the phi|sitions, which is to let you rise with an appetite, which both whetteth your memories and helpeth your stomackes; and for that the after banker may as well please your humors, as the former appeased your hunger, I must beseeke you to rise fro~ this place, and repaire vnto another, where because the wea|ther is hot, and the time vnfit for exercise, we will spende the time in pleasant discourse, feeding our fancies with pleasant talke, as we haue feasted our fast with curious cates. To this motion all the assembly easily consented, in that for the most part, they had bin buzzing in their eares, &amp; baiting their harts, whereupon be brought them into a faire arbor, couered with Roses, and honisuckles, paued with Camamile, pinkes, and violets, garded with two pretie christall fountaines in euerie side, which made the place more coole, &amp; the soyle more fruit|full. They all being entred this arbor, A <HI>saphus</HI> being both learned &amp; pleasant witted, began thus. My ghests said he (for name of Princes I haue sent them lately vnto pallaces) now let each of you be thinke him of mirth not of maiestie, I will haue no stoicall humor in this arbour, but all shall be either louers, or loues wel-willers, and for that, each of vs may bee more apt to talk of <HI>Venus</HI>; we wil taste of her frend <HI>Bacchus</HI>; for a draught of good wine, (if <HI>Lamprias</HI> in <HI>Plutarch,</HI> may be beleeued) whettes the conceits, and be when he had drunke most, debated best: <HI>Aschilus</HI> therefore ere he had dipped his penne in the inks to write tragedies, diued into the bottome of a wine put to find termes; for as, where the wolfe hath bitten most soundest, the flesh is most sweetest, so wheras wine hath warmed most hotely, the tongue is armed most eloquently, I therefore carowse to you my familiars, and as I giue you licour to warme, so will I crowne you with ioy and ro|ses to alay: then haue at loue who list, for me thinks I am al|readie prepared for him: This said be drunke vnto them, and all the rest gaue him the pledge, and being crowned after the manner of the philosophicall banquets, they sate downe. And <HI>Arsadachus</HI> spake thus: <HI>Asaphus</HI> I haue heard that the motion is vaine, vnlesse the action follow, and delights that are talked of before such as like them, except they grow in

force, breede more discontent in their want, then pleasure in their report: as therefore you haue hanged out the Iuie bush, so bring forth the wine, as you haue prefixt the garland, so be|gin the race, as you intimated delight, so bring it to entrance, <HI>Asaphus</HI> smiling replied thus: Do then all these Ladies and braue louers giue me the honour and direction to gouern these sports: They do, said <HI>Margarita</HI>: Then sit aside quoth he and giue place to your commander; whereupon all the as|sembly laughed, and <HI>Asaphus</HI> smilingly sate downe in the highest roome, placing the Ladies opposite against theie lo|uers, and himselfe seated in his soueraintie, began thus: Since in bankets the place is not to be giuen for the maiestie, but the mirth, be not displeased though I preferre my selfe (my sub|iects,) since I know this, that I haue crothets in my head, when I haue tasted the cup, and no man is more apt to talke then I when I haue trafficked with good wine, and were it not so, you had no cause to waxe wroth with my presumption, for as the mason preferreth not the attique stones in his building for nobilitie, neither the painter his precious colours in lim|ning, for their liuelines, neither the shipwright his Cretan ce|dar in framing for the sweetenesse: so in festiualles the ghests are not to be placed, according to the degrees, but their dispo|sitions, for their liuelynesse, not their liuelyhoods, for where pleasures are sought for, the person is smally regarded, which considered, I am iustified. But to our purpose, since loue is the affection that leadeth vs, at him we will leuill our fan|cies, canuassing this question amongst vs, whether bee so best worketh, by the eie, the touch, or the eare, for of the fiue sences I thinke these three are most forcible. Nowe therefore wee will and command you, our masculine subiects, said <HI>Asaphus,</HI> to beginne to our feminine Philosophers, and since you <HI>Arsa|dachus</HI> are of greatest hope, <HI>incipe.</HI> After they had all laughed heartily at the maiesticall vtterance of <HI>Asaphus,</HI> and his im|perious manner, the yong Cuscan saide thus: The <HI>Thebi|ans</HI> in time past, who confined vpon <HI>Pontus,</HI> begat such chil|dren, who when they beheld their parents killed them by their lookes, as it faved with them, so falleth it out with me, who be|thinking my selfe of those thoughtes, which I haue conceiued
<PB REF="27">
in respect of loue, am confounded in thinking of them, such power hath fancie, where it hath hold-fast. I must therefore as they quelled the one, kill the other, or I shall die by thoughts as they did by lookes: but since to die for loue is no death but delight, I will aduenture to thinke, talke, and dis|course of him, and rather perish my selfe, then suffer these pa|stimes to be vnperformed. Our question is of loue faire la|dies, whereat you blush when I speake, and I bowe when I thinke, for he giueth me words to discourse, and courage to decide; for as <HI>Plato</HI> saith, loue is audacious in all things, and forward in attempting any thing: hee yeeldeth speech to the silent, and courage to the bashfull, hee giueth industrie to the negligent, and forwardnes to the sluggard, making a courti|er of a clowne; and lighting on a currish <HI>Minippus,</HI> hee softe|neth him as iron in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">te, and maketh him a courtly <HI>Ari|stippus</HI> vnder his safeconduct; therefore I will talke of him, and with your patience I will satisfie you, that loue hath soo|nest entrance by the eie, and greatest sustenance by the sight; for sight whereas it is stirred vp by many motions, with that spirit which it darteth out from it self, doth likewise disperse a certaine miraculous fierie force, by which meane we both doe and suffer many things: and as among all the senses, the eie extendeth his power furthest, so is his working most forcible; for as the clay petrot draweth fire, so the lookes do gather af|fection. And that the forcible working of the eie may be proo|ued to exceed all other the senses, what reason can be greater, since according to euery affection of the heart or distempera|ture of the minde, the radiations of the eie are correspondent; if the heart be enuious, the lookes dart ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> beames of fierce enuie, as may be considered by that of <HI>Entelidas</HI> in <HI>Plutarch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>

<P>For it is reported that this <HI>Entelidas</HI> taking a delight in his owne liuely beauty, and beholding the same in a spring,
<PB REF="27">
grew in enuy against the same; and by that meanes fell into a sickenesse, whereby he lost both health and beautie. <HI>Narcis|sus,</HI> neither by taste, nor the ministerie of speech, nor the office of scent affected his owne forme, but his sight bereft him of his senses, and the eie drew fancie to the heart; for this cause the poets call Ladies eies <HI>Cupids</HI> coach, the beames his ar|rowes; placing all his triumph and power in them as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hiefest instrument of his seigniorie, and that the eie only be|side the ministerie of other senses, procureth loue, you may perceiue by these examples following. <HI>Xerxes,</HI> who despi|sing the sea, and scorning the land found out new meanes to nauigate, and armies to choake the earth, yet fell in loue with a tree; for hauing seene a plantane in <HI>Lydia</HI> of huge greatnesse, he staied vnder it a hote day, making him a shel|ter of his shadow, a louer of his loues; and afterwardes de|parting from the same, he adorned it with collars of golde and iewelles, as if that that tree had beene his enamoured, o|uer which he appointed a guardian to assist it, fearing lest any should doe violence vnto the branches thereof. And what I pray you) moued this affection in <HI>Xerxes</HI> but the eie? A no|ble yong man of <HI>Athens</HI> loued so much the stature of good fortune erected neere vnto the <HI>Prytaneum,</HI> that he embraced it, and kissed it, and offered a great summe of money to the Senate to redeeme the same, and not attaining his suite, hee slew himselfe; and what wrought this in this noble yong man but the eie? for this marble image had neither sent to delight the sent, speach to affect the eare, nor other meanes to moue affection; it was then the sole force of the eie which conduct|eth to the heart each impression, and fixeth each fancie in the same: what resteth there then but to giue the honor to the eie? which as it is the best part in a woman, so hath it the most force in loue. Soft (saide <HI>Plicotus</HI>) claime not the triumph before you heare the triall; for if vertue and the whole praise thereof (as the philosophers say) consisteth in act, let the touch haue the first place, and the eie the second; for lookes doe but kindle the flame, where the touch both maketh it burne, and when it listeth, quencheth the furie. Such as beholde <HI>Anter</HI> are healed of the falling sick<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nesse (saieth <HI>Arsadachus</HI>) and
<PB REF="28">
they that sleepe vnder <HI>Sinilan</HI> at such time as the plant swel|leth and beareth his floure, are slaine. Quoth <HI>Plicotus,</HI> saf|fron floures procure sleepe; the Amethist staieth drunkennesse, by which reasons you ought to ascribe as much power to the scent as to the sight. But heare me, you detracters from the touch; the hearb <HI>Alissus</HI> taken in the hand, driues sighes from the heart. Yea but (said <HI>Arsadachus</HI>) the mad elephant be|holding the raine groweth wilde. Yea but the wilde bull tied to the figge tree, and tasting thereof, is no more wrathful (said <HI>Plicotus</HI>) ascribe therefore to the touch farre more then the sight; heape all the argument that can be for the eies, it bree|deth the sickenesse: but wee rather commend the hearbe that purgeth the disease, then the humour that feedeth it, the salue that healeth the wound, than the corrosiue that grieueth it, the floure that comforteth the braine, and not that which cloy|eth the same: the touch therefore in loue should haue the pre|rogatiue which both reareth it, and restraineth it; and that the touch hath greater power then the sight, what greater reason may be alleadged then this, that we only see to desire, especi|ally to touch? the furniture of all delight is the taste, and the purgatorie in loue, is to touch, and want power to execute the affection, as may appeare by this example. In the dayes of <HI>Apollonius Tianeus,</HI> who by euery man was held for the fountaine of wisedome, there was an eunuch found out in <HI>Ba|bylon</HI> who had vnlawfully conuersed with a paramour of the Kings; for which cause the king demaunded of <HI>Apollonius</HI> what punishment the eunuch ought to haue for that his rash and bold enterprise: no other answered <HI>Apollonius</HI> saue that he liue to behold and touch without further attempt. With which answere the king being amazed, demaunded why he gaue this answer. To whome <HI>Apollonius</HI> replied; Doub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> not you, O king, but that loue shall make him feele exceeding paines and martirdomes; and like a simple flie, he shall play so long with the flame vntill he fall to cinders.

the bodie. <HI>Asaphus</HI> that was still all this while, sodainely brake off the discourse, saying thus: What sense (I pray you) was that (ye philosophers) that perswaded <HI>Ariston</HI> of <HI>Ephe+sus</HI> to lie with an asse, and to beget a daughter, which was af|terwards called <HI>Onoselino</HI>? what sense had <HI>Tullius Stellus</HI> to be in loue with a mare, of whome he begat a faire daugh|ter which was called <HI>Sponano</HI>? what made <HI>Cratis</HI> the Ilo|ritane shepheard to loue a goate? <HI>Pasiphae</HI> to fancie a bull<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Stilconos</HI> hearing that question, replied thus: Truely a senslesse desire, which hauing no power of loue but instinct of life, ought neither to be mentioned by modest tongues, nor vttered in chaste hearing: that loue which is gathered by the eie, and grounded in the heart, which springeth on the vnifor|mitie of affection, hauing in it selfe al the principles of musike (as <HI>Theophrastus</HI> saith) as griefe, pleasure, and diuine in|struct that loue which the <HI>Graecians</HI> call <HI>Ghiciprion,</HI> which is as much to say as bitter sweete; of that we talke, and no o|ther, which sacred affection I haue both tasted with the eie, and tried by the touch, &amp; haue found so many effects in both, that as the sea ebbes and flowes by the motion of the moone: the <HI>Tropi</HI> of Egypt waxe and waine according to the flouds, and fall of <HI>Nilus,</HI> so haue I by smiles, and louers pleasures, &amp; repulses, found such a taste in loue, that did not the eare claim some greater preheminence, I should subscribe to you both: but as loue beginneth by the sight, and hath pleasure in the touch, so gathereth he his eternitie from hearing, by hearing <HI>Cupid</HI> a boy, is made <HI>Cupid</HI> a god, by hearing <HI>Cupid</HI> scarce fligd gathereth store of feathers; for euen as breath extingui|sheth fire in the beginning, but when it is increased, both nou|risheth and strengtheneth it, so loue that is couered members by the aire, and scarce enabled and fashioned by the touch, is angrie with those that discouer him; but when he flies abroad, and braggeth in his wrings, he is fedde with sweete wordes and laughes, at pleasant languish if he faint, kinde wordes do releeue him; if he be sicke, perswasions purge him; if hee misdeeme, reasons recouer him; in briefe, by the eare loue sucketh, by the eare loue thriueth, and by the eare all his es|sence is fashioned: and for that cause <HI>Melpomene</HI> and <HI>Ter|psicore</HI>
<PB REF="29">
the Muses are gouernours of our hearing, whereas not any muse or godhead hath any affectio~ to the eie or touch: for delight and gladnesse in loue proceedeth from eloquent perswasion, which receiued by the eare, changeth, mooueth, altereth and gouerneth all the passions of the heart. <HI>Marga|rita</HI> blushing in that her turne was next, draue <HI>Stilconos</HI> out of his text in this sort: My lord (saide shee) if loue were ga|thered by the eare, olde men for their wise discourses shoulde winne more credite then yong men for their worthy comlines; or if by the touch, loue had his triall, the diuinitie of loue would be wronged by too much inhumanitie. It must be the eie then which can discern the rude colt from the trained steed, the true diamond from the counterfet glasse, the right colour from the rude, and the perfect beautie from the imperfect be|hauiour: had not the eie the prerogatiue, loue shoulde bee a monster, no myracle: and were the touch only iudge, the soft Ermine for daintinesse, the Seale for his softnesse, the Mar|terne for his smoothe sweetenesse, would exceede both Ladies best perfections, and the finest skinne of the choicest louer. If by the eare loue were discerned, the Syren by her sweet song should winne more fauour then <HI>Sibilla</HI> for hir science, and the flatterer should be held for the best fauourite: let the eie ther|fore haue the prerogatiue, which is both curious to beholde, and emperious to conquer. By it the heart may discouer his affections as well as fine phrases, and more sweete hath of|tentimes beene gathered by a smile then a touch: for by the one, we gather a hope of succeeding pleasure, by the other, a ioy in suspect for feare we be deceiued, which beginneth in a minute and endeth in a moment. All cattes are grey in the darke (said <HI>Calandra</HI>) and therefore (good madam) you doe well to preferre the eie. Yea but said <HI>Ephania,</HI> the eie had neede of a candle to light it, or else (perhaps) the fatte were in the fire. Well (said <HI>Gerenia</HI>) I will trust mine eare then: for where neither the eie seeth, nor the touch feeleth, certainely by darke let me heare the words, for they are the tell-troths, Ah <HI>Gerenia</HI> (said <HI>Stilconos</HI>) trust them not, for they that are false for the most part by day, wil (perhappes) faile you in the night.

these three sences in one, and then tell me the felicitie, when the eie shall giue earnest of the heart, the heart take comfort by the eare, the wordes we haue heard, and the sights wee haue seene confirmed by touch, this is the loue I had rather haue in mine armes then heare it in this place discoursed by argument. Since therefore (my subiects) you are at my o|beisance, and vpon my direction are to doe homage to loue, I giue you free licence to discourse, free libertie to looke, the sweetes whereof, after you haue gathered, come to me, and after the priest hath hand-fasted you, come touch &amp; spare not, you shall haue my pattent to take your pleasure. It is a dan|gerous matter (said <HI>Arsadachus</HI>) to enter those lists where women will do what they list.

With that they brake vp the assembly, for it was supper time, and the prince intreated them to sit downe, where they merrily passed the time, laugh|ing heartily at the pleasant and honest mirth wherein they had passed that afternoone.</P>
<P>The supper ended, each louer tooke his mistres apart, where they handled the matter in such sort, that <HI>Margarita</HI> which was before but easily fired, now at last grew altogether infla|med, for the night calling them thence, &amp; the companie taking their leaue, she with a bitter sigh and earnest blush, tooke her leaue of <HI>Arsadachus</HI> thus: My Lord said she, if time lost bee hardly recouered, and fauours wonne are to be followed, haue a care of your estate, who may bragge of that fortune that no one in <HI>Mosco</HI> can equall: which saide, she in all her periode of sighes ending as abruptly as she had begun, and so departed. <HI>Arsadachus</HI> that knew the tree by the fruit, the cloth by the list, the apple by the cast, fained not to see what he most percei|ued, and taking his leaue of <HI>Asaphus</HI> departed to his lodging where in a carelesse vaine, as if cloking and smothering with loue, he worte these verses.</P>

<P>Thus passed the affaires in <HI>Mosco</HI> til such time as the em|perour growing more and more in sicknes; by the consent of his nobles, hasted on the marriage. The rumor whereof be|ing spread abroad, made euery one reioice; but among the rest, <HI>Margarita</HI> triumphed, who called into open assembly by the Emperour, was betrothed to <HI>Arsadachus</HI> in the presence of the nobilitie, who by his lowring lookes at that time, shewed his discontents; yet will he, nill he, the day was appointed, the sixteenth of the Calends of <HI>March,</HI> next insuing: against which time there were high preparations in Court, and throughout all the prouinces for pastimes. But since it is a most true axi|ome among the Philosophers, that whereas be many errors, there likewise must needs follow many offences: it must need|ly follow, that since <HI>Arsadachus</HI> was so fraught with corrupt thought, hee should practise and perforne no lesse vngratious corrupt and vngodly actions, for no sooner was hee departed from the presence of the Emperour, but he presently beganne
<PB REF="31">
to imagine how to breake off his nuptialls, forcing in himselfe a forgetfulnesse of <HI>Margaritaes</HI> vertues, her loue and good deserts, so that it may euidently be perceiued and approued that which <HI>Ammonius</HI> saith, that things concluded in neces|sitie are dissolued by violence, and truely not without reason was loue compared to the sunne, for as the sun thrusteth forth his purer &amp; warmer beams through darknes and the thickest cloude, so loue pierceth the most indurate heartes, and as the sunne is sometime inflamed, so likewise is vnstable loue quicklie kindled. Moreouer, as the constitution of that body which vseth no exercise endureth not the sunne, so likewise an illiterate and corrupt mind cannot entertaine loue, for both of them after the same manner are disturbed from their estates, and attainted with sicknes, blaming not the force of loue, but their owne weakenesse. But this difference is betweene loue and the sunne, for that the sunne sheweth both faire and foule things to those that looke on vpon the earth: loue onelie ta|keth care of the beautie of faire things, and onely fixeth the eies vpon such things, enforcing vs to let slip all other. By this may be gathered that <HI>Arsadachus</HI> being vicious coulde not iustly be attainted with loue, but with some slight passion, such as affect the greatest tyrants in beholding the pittifull massacre of the innocent, as shal manifestly appeare by the se|quele: for after long debating in his restlesse minde, somtime to flie the court, and by that meanes to escape the bondage which he supposed was in wedlocke; sometime to make the princes away by poison, ridding himselfe thereby of suspect, and <HI>Artosogon</HI> of hope.

Among all other, af|ter the supper was solemnized, he brought in a maske of the goddesses, wherein his daughter (being the mirrour and the <HI>Aperse</HI> of the whole world for beautie) was apparelled like <HI>Diana,</HI> her haire scattered about her shoulders, compassed with a siluer crownet, her necke decked with carkanets of pearle, her daintie body was couered with a vaile of white net-work wrought with wiers of siluer, and set with pearle, where through the milke white beauties of the sweete Saint gaue so heauenly a reflexion, that it was sufficient to make <HI>Saturne</HI> merry and mad with loue, to fixe his eie on them: a|mong all the rest that had both their partes of perfection and beautie, and great louers to like the~, <HI>Arsadachus</HI> made choise of this <HI>Diana</HI> (who not onely resembled her in that shew, but indeed was called by the name of <HI>Diana</HI>) on whose face when he had fixed his eies, he grew so inflamed as <HI>Montgibel</HI> yeel|deth not so much smoke as he sent out sighes: to be briefe, he grew so sodainely altered, that as such as beheld the head of <HI>Medus</HI> were altred from their shapes, so he that saw the hea|uen of these beauties, was rauished from his sences: to bee briefe, after he had danced the measures, passed the night, and was conducted by <HI>Argias</HI> and his attendants, hee tooke no rest, but tossing on his bed, grew so altered, that on the mor|row all the court was amazed to behold his melancholies. It cannot be reported how strangely he demeaned himselfe, for his sleeps fled him, his colour changed, his speech vncertain, his apparel carelesse: which <HI>Argias</HI> perceiuing as being mar|uellous pollitique, ministred oile to the lamp, fuel to the fire,

flaxe to the flame, encreasing his daughters beautie with cost, and <HI>Arsadachus</HI> loue by her companie; for he ceased not to inuite him, hoping that at the last the cloudes would breake out and raine him some good fortune. <HI>Diana</HI> was trained by him to the lewre, &amp; taught her lesson with great cunning, who was as apt to execute as her father to counsell. <HI>Arsadachus</HI> one day among the rest finding the opportunitie, &amp; desirous to discouer his conceits was stricken so dombe with her diuine beautie, as he could not disclose his minde. Whereupon cal|ling for pen and inke, he wrote this, thrusting it in <HI>Dianaes</HI>
bosome, walked melancholy into a faire garden on the backe side of <HI>Argiaes</HI> pallace, where he wept so bitterly, that it was supposed his heart would burst.</P>

<P><HI>Diana</HI> tooke no daies to peruse this ditty, but hauing ouer|read it, gaue it her father to iudge of, who faining a seueritie more then ordinarie, and glad of the opportunitie, entered the garden where the prince was welnie forespent with sorrow, &amp; taking occasion to interrupt his meditations, he began thus: Most royall Prince, I thinke the heauens lowre on me, that labouring by al indeuours to procure your delights, I rather find you more melancholy by my motions, then merry by my entertainment: Alas my Lord, if either my actions do dis|please,

Lastly vpon thy faithfull oth I may ventre further, but so as thy silence may make thee hap|piest man in <HI>Cosco.</HI> To be of faire words (<HI>Argias</HI>) becom|meth a man of much vertue; and no small treasure findeth that Prince who hath a priuy and faithful secretarie, in whose bosome he may powre his thoughts, on whose wisedome he&eacute; may repose his secrets. <HI>Plutarch</HI> writeth that the <HI>Atheni|ans</HI>
hauing warre with king <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Macedon,</HI> by chaunce lighted vpon certaine letters which he had written to <HI>Olim|pias</HI> his wife, which they not onely sent backe sealed and vn|searched, but also said, that since they were bound by their laws to be secret, they would neither see nor reade other me~s priuate motions, <HI>Diodorus Siculus,</HI> writeth that among the <HI>Egyptians</HI> it was a criminal act, to open secrets which he proueth to be true, by example of a priest, who had vnlawfull companie with a virgin of the goddesse <HI>Isis,</HI> both which tru|sting their secrecie to another priest, and hee hauing little care to keepe their action concealed, sodainely cried out, where through the offenders were found out and slaine, and he bani|shed. And where as the same priest complained against the vniust sentence, saying: that whatsoeuer he had reueled was in fauour of religion, he was answered by the Iudge, if thou alone hadst knowne it without being priuie to them, or hadst thou had notice without corrupt consent, thou shouldst haue reason to be aggreeued; but sodainely whereas they trusted

their secrecie vnto thee which they had in hand, and thou pro|misedst them to keepe silence, hadst thou remembred thee of thy bond and promise, and the law which we haue to be secret in all things, thou hadst neuer had the courage to publish it. <HI>Plutarch</HI> in his booke of banishment saith, that an <HI>Athenian</HI> sought vnder the cloke of an <HI>Egyptian,</HI> asked him what hee carried hid, to whom he answered: Thou shewest thy selfe smally read and worse nurtered (O thou <HI>Athenian</HI>) sith thou perceiuest not that I carrie this hid for no other respect, but that I would haue no man know what I carrie, many other are the examples of <HI>Anaxileus, Dionisius, Plato,</HI> and <HI>Bia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> which were too long for me to report, and too tedious for th&eacute;e to heare, my onely desire is to let thee knowe the waight of secrecie, and the punishment that knowing the one and the o|ther (my <HI>Argias,</HI>) thou mightst in respect of thy life keepe si|lence with the tongue.</P>
<P><HI>Argias</HI> that knew the bird by the feather, and the eagle by the flight, the leopard by his spot, &amp; the lyon by his claw, cut off his circumlocutions, with this discourse; <HI>Aristarchus</HI>
the Philosopher (most noble prince) was wont to say, that by reason of their instabilitie, knew not that which the most men ought to desire, nor that which they should flie, because that euerie day changeth, and swift Time flieth: <HI>Eubeus</HI> the Philosopher, was wont many times to talke this at the table of great <HI>Alexander</HI>; by nature euerie one is prompt &amp; sharpe witted, to giue counsell and to spea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e his opinion in other mens affaires, and fond and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">low in his owne purposes. Truely this sentence was both graue and learned, for manie there be that are discreet in other mens causes, &amp; iudge right|ly, but among ten thousand there is not one that is not decei|ued in his own causes. This considered, your grace doth most wisely, to seeke to disburden your thoughts in a secret bo|some, and to aske counsell of another in your earnest occasi|ons, for by the one you shall benefite your griefe, by the other conquer it.

is therefore vertue in you (good prince) if in immitation of so great a Chiefetaine, you rather trust other mens wisedome, then your owne wit: and since it pleaseth you to grace me with the hope of secrecie, your excellencie shall not neede to misdoubt, for by all those gods whom I reuerence, by this right hand which I lay on thy honourable Ioines, so may my pastures be plentifull my barnes filled, my vines burthened, as I vow to be secret, resolued to seale my faith with such as|surance, as death it self shal neuer be able to dissolue it. <HI>Arsa|dachus</HI>
hearing his zealous promises, and weighing his wise answeres, by the one, assured himselfe of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> loyaltie, by the o|ther, gathered his great wisedome and learning; whereupon taking <HI>Argias</HI> by the hand, and withdrawing himselfe into a verie secrete and close arbour in the garden, hee, after hee had a while rested himselfe, and meditate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> on that he had to say, with a bitter sigh brake out into these speeches. Oh <HI>Ar|gias,</HI> had the destinies made vs as prone to indure the assaults of loue, as they haue made vs prompt to delight in them, if they had fauoured vs with as much power is pacifie the furie of them, as they haue giuen vs will to perseuer in the follie, I could then be mine owne phisition, without discouering my griefe, and salue that with discretion, which I nowe sigh for through dispaire. But since they haue denied vs that grace in their secret wisedome, to haue wil to relieue our own weak|nesse, purges to expulse our poysons, and constancie to endure loues conflicts, I must haue recourse vnto thee, in whom co~|sisteth the source of all my safetie, beseeching thee (deare <HI>Ar|gias</HI>) if thou hearest that thou shouldest not, consider that I suffer that I would not, and so temper my defects, by the force and effects of thy wisedome, that I may be relieued and thou nothing greeued.

O Prince this last doubt is your least daunger, for where you may command my life, where you are lord of my wealth, can I be so forgetfull of duetie, thinke you to denie you my daughter, whose worth is of too great weakenesse, to entertaine such dignitie? but since it pleaseth your excellence to daine it her in vertuous sort, command me and her to our vtmost powers, we are yours. <HI>Arsadachus</HI> thinking him|selfe in heauen, thanked <HI>Argias</HI> for his courtesie, who at last wholly discouered vnto him, how secret he was to his affec|tions, shewing him his sonnet: to be briefe, it was so com|plotted that without further delay, <HI>Arsadachus</HI> should bee presently wedded to <HI>Diana,</HI> which was effected so, that both these two married couples in the height of their pleasures, passed their time in wonderfull delight in <HI>Argias</HI> castle. But as nothing is hidden from the aid of Time, neither is any thing so secret which shall not be reuealed: the emperor <HI>Ar|tosogon</HI> (by reason of <HI>Arsadachus</HI> continuall abode at <HI>Ar|gias</HI> house) discouered at last both the cause and the contract: whereupon, storming like the Ocean incensed with a north|east brise, he presently sent for <HI>Argias</HI>; and without either hearing his excuses, or regard of his intreaties, presently caused him to be torne in peeces at the tailes of foure wilde horses, then casting his mangled members into a litter, hee sent them to <HI>Diana</HI> in a present, vowing to serue her in the same sawce her father had tasted, that durst so insolently ad|uenture to espouse with the sole heire of his empire. The poore ladie almost dead, to see the dead bodie of her father, but more moued with her owne destruction which was to fol|low, fell at <HI>Arsadachus</HI> feete, beseeching him with brinish

teares, which fell in her delicate bosome, to be the patrone of her fortunes. <HI>Arsadachus</HI> who loued her entirely, comforted her the best he might, assuring her safetie, in spight of his fa|thers tyrannie; whereuppon he leuied a guard of his chiefest friends to the number of three thousand men, and shutting <HI>Diana</HI> in a strong fortresse, left her after many sweet embra|ces in their custodie: and for that the time of his coronation drew neere, be assembled foure thousand such as hee knew most assured; he repaired to the court, vowing in his mind such a reuenge on his father, as all the world should wonder to heare the sequele. Being arriued in court, hee cloyed the gates thereof with armed men, placing in euery turning of the citie sufficient rowts of guard to keepe the citizens from insurrection: Then ascending the royall chamber where the Emperour his father with his nobilitie were resident, hee prowdly drew him from his seate royall, in which action those of the nobilitie which resisted him were slaine, the rest that tremblingly behelde the tragedie, heard this which ensueth: <HI>Arsadachus</HI> prowdly setting him in his fathers seate, was ready to speake vnto the assembly, when the olde Emperour that had recouered his fall, awaking his spirites, long dulled with age and weakenesse, beganne in this sort to vpbraide his vngracious heire: Uiper villaine and worse, auaunt, and get thee out of my presence. How darest thou lay handes on thy Lord? or staine the emperiall seate with thine impure and de|filed person?

The rumour of whose fall was no sooner bruited in the eares of <HI>Arsadachus,</HI> but that instead of solemnizing their funeralles, he frequented his follies, instead of lamenting for them, hee laughed at them, causing them for fashion sake to haue the fa|uour of the graue, not for any fauour he bare them: then cal|ling for <HI>Diana</HI> to his court, he honoured her as a goddesse, causing his subiects to erect a shrine, and to sacrifice vnto her: and such was his superstitious and besotted blindnes, that he thought it the only paradise of the world to be in her presence, no one was better rewarded then he that could best praise hir; sometimes would he (attiring him like a second <HI>Diana</HI> readie to chace) disguise himselfe like a shepheard, and sitting apart solitarily, where he might be in her presence, he would recount such passions as gaue certaine signes in him of an excellent wit, but matched with exceeding wickednes: among which these tenne, as the most excellent for varietie sake, after his so many villanies, I thought good to set downe in this place.</P>

sunne, the sunne to haste his course, arose from his bed, appa|relling himselfe in rich and princelie robes: about which houre <HI>Diana</HI> was not idle, for whatso of excellence could be bought for money, or had for friendship, she wanted nothing thereof to set out her beautie: the courtiers to grace their Emperor, spared no cost, the cittizens no triumphs, so as the triumph of <HI>Antigonus Epiphanus,</HI> in co~parison hereof was but a trifle, the maner whereof, since it was miraculous, I haue thought good to mention in this place. First came fiue thousand of the yoongest Cuscanes out of the pallace, trotting along the streetes vnto the temple armed, according to the Roman fa|shion: after them as ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <HI>Tartars</HI> armed after their maner, who were folowed with three thousand <HI>Thracians,</HI> and <HI>Ples|sians,</HI> all of which carried siluer lances and shieldes, hauing their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> peeces decked with ostrige plumes and emeralds: after them marched two hundred and fiftie sword-players, who followed the braue caualiers that marched before; after whom trotted the horsemen, of which one thousand, together with their horses, were all pompously garnished with golde and siluer, with a garland of gold vpon their heads: after the~ rode another thousand horsemen, decked with golde and pur|ple, with lances of golde, headed with pointed diamonds: next them rode those which were called the emperours minions, clothed in cloth of tissue, their horses trapped in greene cloth of gold, their stirrops of siluer: after them came the Empe|rours guard on horse backe, hauing their caparisons studded with iron and brasse, wearing vpon their armors a certain cu|rious stoale, wherein, with gold and siluer, silke, and gossan|pine threed of many colours, were wouen the images of those gods, which the Cuscans most worshipped: after whome came one thousand fiue hundreth armed chariots, the most part drawn by two white genets, but fortie of them by foure: after them there came a chariot drawne by elephants, and at|tended by sixe and thirtie elephants, with eight hundred yong men attending them as their keepers, attired with orna|ments of golde, and hauing their temples encompassed with wreathes of roses, and siluer bends: after them came eight hundred yong lads leading many fat oxen with gilded hornes
<PB REF="44">
to be sacrificed to the gods: next vnto them eight hundred ministers bearing platters of gold with pretious stones, vni|corns horns, and elephants teeth to be sacrificed for the health of the emperour: next which, an infinite number of statues were carried, not onely of their gods, but also of those fiends they feared; likewise the images of all their kings deceased, according as euery one deserued for his excellence, apparelled in goodly garments of golde and siluer, and other precious and inestimable iewelles, each of them hauing a table at his feete, in which al his noble and worthy actions were written. There were likewise other semblances of the day, the night, of heauen, of the morning and mid-day, with an infinit num|ber of vessels likewise forged out of gold and siluer, and borne by the slaues of the empire: after these came six hundred pa|ges of the emperour apparelled in golde: after whome came three hundred virgins in white cloth of tissue, burning with censors in their handes of siluer: and <HI>Agate</HI> spreading sundry sorts of sweete perfumes followed by fiue hundred eoches of siluer, wherein <HI>Dianaes</HI> damosels were carried: after which came fourescore of beaten gold, wherein all the princely heirs of the empire were royally seated. After all these the Em|perour with his <HI>Diana</HI> rode in one coach attended with one hundred attired in beaten cloth of siluer, casting rich cloth be|fore the coach, whereon the horses that drew the Emperour should treade. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t were a vaine thing for me to set downe the riches of <HI>Arsadachus</HI> garments, or the attire of his goddesse: sufficeth it that it exceeded that which is past, and all was be|yond beleefe: In this solemne sort entred they the temple, where (according to the custome) they were sacred, annointed and inthroned, receiuing homage of the princes. And after in selfe like pompe returned they to the pallace: where hauing many rich delicates prepared for them with sweet and melo|dious musike they sate them downe to eate; where, after they had somewhat refreshed their stomackes, and whetted their wittes with costly wines, <HI>Arsadachus</HI> remembring him of his <HI>Margarita,</HI> called for his box, merily iesting with <HI>Diana,</HI> and saying, that the Empresse of <HI>Mosco</HI> deserued so small a remembrance&punc; which was no sooner brought vnto him, and
<PB REF="44" MS="y">
opened, but (see the iudgement of iust heauen) a sodain flame issued thereout, which with a hideous odour so bestraught <HI>Arsadachus</HI> of his senses, that thrusting the tables from him, and ouerthrowing whatsoeuer incountred him, he brake out from his seate, cursing the hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ens, renting his embal|med haire, tearing his royall vestures: his nobilitie that saw this, became amazed, and among the rest, <HI>Brasidas,</HI> who fled for the murther in <HI>Mosco,</HI> and was at that time in great fa|uour with him, came to pacifie him; who no sooner espied him, but taking a huge boule of wine, and crying out, <HI>Brasi|das,</HI> I drinke to <HI>Philenia</HI> whome thou murtheredst, he tast|ed the wine, and with the cup tooke him such a mighty blow on the head that he pashed out all his braines: all they that behelde this sate still; some for feare stole secretly out of his presence, among the rest, wofull <HI>Diana</HI> rather like the statue of <HI>Venus</HI> raised in <HI>Paphos,</HI> then the louely <HI>Lucina</HI> that gaue light to all <HI>Arsadachus</HI> delights, sate still quaking and trem|bling, as one readie to depart th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s life; whom when the Em|peror espied where she sate, he hastily ranne vnto her, crying out; Ah tyrant that hast robbed me of my heart, my hope and life, let me sacrifice to <HI>Nemesis</HI>; I will sacrifice: which said, with the caruing knife he slit vp the poore innocent ladies bodie, spreading her entrailes about the pallace floore, and seizing on her heart, hee tare it in peeces with his tyrannous teeth, crying, <HI>Sic itur ad astra</HI>; by this ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e the rumour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as spread throughout the pallace, and from the pallace through the citie: by which meanes the triumphs which were com|menced were turned to mournings, for <HI>Arsadachus</HI> vsed such cruelties euery way, that the <HI>Numantines</HI> for all their inhu|manitie could neuer be able to match him. And in this fitte continued he for the space of sixe houres, at which time he en|tred the secrets of his pallace, and finding there a yong sonne which his <HI>Diana</HI> had bred and he begotten; he tooke it by the legges, battering out the braines thereof against the walles, in such sort as the beholders were amazed to see him; this done he flung it on the ground among the dead members of his mother, calling on the name of <HI>Artosogon</HI> and <HI>Lelia</HI> his father and mother, and telling them, that in some part he had
<PB REF="45">
yeelded them reuenge. By this time <HI>Arsinous</HI> and <HI>Marga|rita</HI> were entred the citie, who hearing the turmoile thorow the citie, questioned the cause thereof, and were certified by those that passed by, in what estate the emperour was at that present. <HI>Margarita</HI> hearing the cause, beganne wofully to exclaime, til she was pacified by <HI>Arsinous,</HI> who told hir that the nature of the medicine which he gaue her, was such, that if <HI>Arsadachus</HI> were constant to her, it would increase his af|fection; if false, it would procure madnesse: to which effect, since the matter was brought, it coulde not be but the yoong Emperour had wronged her. With these perswasions hee drew her to the pallace, where thrusting through the prease <HI>Arsinous</HI> thought himselfe happy to see such a reuenge wrought on his enemie. <HI>Margarita</HI> was heartlesse to behold the dolefull estate of <HI>Arsadachus,</HI> so that forgetting the honor of his name, and the modestie of her sex, she brake thorow the guard, and ranne to <HI>Arsadachus,</HI> where he sate embrewed in the bloud of innocents, and with teares spake thus vnto him; Is this the ioy of my loue (said she) are these thy welcomes to thy beloued in steede of triumphes to feast her with trage|dies, in lieu of banquets, with blood? why speaketh not my deare spouse? why lookest thou so ghastly? O if it bee thy pleasure to shew crueltie on me, make it short by a death, not lingering by life. <HI>Arsadachus</HI> all this while sate mute gast|ly staring on <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">arita</HI>; at last fiercely flinging her from his necke, his rage reuiued and he cried out; <HI>Diana,</HI> ah <HI>Dia|na</HI> by thy bright lookes, by thy beautifull lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">kes, let not thy ghost be displeased, thou shalt haue bloud for bloud, here is the sacrifice, here is the instrument; whereupon drawing a rapier out of the sheath of one of those who ministred fast by him, he ranne <HI>Margarita</HI> quite thorow the bodie: and in this sort with bedlam madnesse fled out of the presence to his pri|uy chamber. The poore princesse euen when death beganne <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o arrest her, pursued him: and as she indeuoured to vtter hir moanes, fell downe dead on the floore; whom <HI>Arsinous</HI> wo|fully bewept, and in the presence of the princesse of <HI>Cusco,</HI> discouered what she was. Then beganne each of them to i|magine a new feare, doubting lest the Emperour of <HI>Mosco</HI>
<PB REF="45">
should reuenge her death at their handes. For which cause they consulted how to shut vp <HI>Arsadachus</HI> til <HI>Protomachus</HI> were certified, which they effected sodainely, in that they found him laide on his bed, and soundly sleeping, enforced thereunto by the industrie and art of <HI>Arsinous.</HI> Who after he perceiued the whole assembly of princes dismayed, caused the ministers to gather vp the mangled members and couer the~ with a rich cloth of gold, and afterwards seeing al the cour|tiers attentiue, he beganne in this manner&punc; <HI>Thales</HI> (ye wor|thie princes) after he had trauelled long time, and at last re|turned home, being asked what strange or rare thing hee had seene in his voiage, answered; an olde tyrant: for certaine it is, that such as practise open wrong, liue not long; for the gods yeeld them shortest life that haue the wickedest wayes: muse not therefore to see your yong Emperour in these passi|ons, whose sinnes if they be ripped vp exceede al sence, whose tyrannies surpasse the beleefe of any, but such as haue tried them. What, know you not of his disobedience, who spared not his owne father that begate him, his deere mother that bred him? What, knowe you not of his periurie? that hath falsified his faith to <HI>Protomachus,</HI> betraied and murthered <HI>Margarita,</HI> and at one time frustrated the hope of both these empires? What, know you not of his murthers, where these in sight are sufficient to conuict him: but those I sigh for are more odious, who thorow his lewd lus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e reft me (poore <HI>Ar|sinous</HI>) of my daughter, and her of an husband? But the iust gods haue suffered me to behold the reuenge with mine eies, which I haue long wished for with my heart. Truely (yee <HI>Cuscans</HI>) ye are not to maruell at these chaunces, if you bee wise, neither to wonder at your emperours troubles, if you haue discretion; for as vnitie (according to <HI>Pythagoras</HI>) is the father of number, so is vice the originall of many sorows. When the fish <HI>Tenthis</HI> appeareth aboue the water, there fo|loweth a tempest: when euils are growne to head, there must needely follow punishment; for as the gods in mercie delay, so at last in iustice they punish. Heare me yee men of <HI>Cusco,</HI> and consider my words, if neuer as yet any tyrant liued with|out his tragedie what should you expect? In faith no other
<PB REF="46">
thing but the confirmation of <HI>Platoes</HI> reason, who saide that it is vnnecessarie for him to liue, that hath not learned how to liue well. The tyrant of <HI>Sicely Dionisius,</HI> of whome it is said, that he gaue as great rewarde to those that inuented vi|ces, as Rome did to those that conquered realmes) died a priuate man and in miserie. Nowe what in respect of this man can you hope of <HI>Arsadachus,</HI> who hired not men to in|uent, but did himselfe in person practise: beleeue me, beleeue me, your sufferance of such a viper in your realme, is a hai|nous sinne in you, and as <HI>Dion</HI> saith, it is but meete they be partakers to the paine, who haue wincked at the fault. <HI>Cali|gula</HI>
the emperor of Rome was so disordered in his life, that if all the Romanes had not watched to take life from him, he would haue waited to take life from them; this monster bare a brooch of gold in his cap, wherin was written this sentence: <HI>Vtinam omnis populus vnam praecis&egrave; ceruicem haberet, vt vno ictu omnes necarem.</HI> And what was this man in regarde of <HI>Arsadachus</HI>? Truely almost innocent; for the one pretended kindnesse to those that gently perswaded him, but the other neither feared the gods, neither spared his friends, neither re|garded iustice, and can such a monster deserue life? The Ro|manes when the tyrant <HI>Tiberius</HI> was made away, sacrificed in their open streetes, in that the gods had reft them of such a troublesome wretch; why cease you then (you <HI>Cuscans</HI>) to sacrifice to your gods, to the end they may deliuer you of this trouble-world. It was a lawe among the Romanes, that that childe which had disobeyed his father, robbed any temple, iniured any widdowe, committed any treason to a stranger should be banished from Rome, and disinherited of his fathers possessions; and what hath not <HI>Arsadachus</HI> done of these things? and why is not <HI>Arsadachus</HI> punished? <HI>Sce|dasus</HI> daughters being violated in <HI>Lacedemon,</HI> and vnre|uenged by the magistrates of the cittie; the gods inflicted both the guiltie and vnguiltie with plagues, in that they afflicted not punishment on the offenders: and what can you hope (ye <HI>Cuscans</HI>) that suffer this sincke of sinne to triumph in your pallaces? You will perhappes say, that no man is to be pu|nished afore hee be conuicted. And (I pray you) for what
<PB REF="46">
should ill men pleade? since as <HI>Chrisippus</HI> saith, nothing is profitable vnto them. You see testimonies of his murther be|fore your eies, tokens of his periury I ring in your eares, his lust the gods abhorre, and shall he yet liue?</P>
<P>This said, there grew a great muttering among the nobi|litie, and the noise thereof awaked the emperour (whose sleep had stayed the working of the inchantment) who finding him selfe wholy imbrewed with blood, his doores fast locked vnto him, beganne to misdeeme: whereuppon calling and exclaim|ing on his attendants, some of them at last fearefully opened the doores. The nobilitie hearing of his freedome, presently fled, but when as the fatall fruits of his furie were discouered vnto him, and his ruthfull eies beheld what his hands had ex|ecuted, Lord what pittifull exclamations vsed he! how hee rent his breast with furie, how he tare his face: At last, lay|ing him downe vpon the mangled members of <HI>Diana,</HI> and embracing the dead bodie of <HI>Margarita,</HI> hee washed both of them in his teares, and demeaned himselfe so wofully, as it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> wonder to behold; at last, with a bitter sigh he brake out into these bitter words, (whilest his nobles hearing of his re|couery, beganne to reenter the pallace) True it is that <HI>Plu|tarch</HI> saith (quoth he) that life is a stage-play, which euen vn|to the last act hath no decorum: life is replenished with al vi|ces, and empouerished of all vertue. Sooth spake <HI>Chrisip|pus</HI> when he alleadged this, that the euilles of this life are so many, that the gods can not inuent more, neither a liuing man indure halfe; so that rightly I may say with <HI>Hercules</HI>:
<Q><L>Plenus malorum sum iam, nec superest locus</L>
<L>Alijs nouis recipiandis&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>But why philosophie I of life complaining on it where I ought onely to conuict my selfe? It is not the wret|chednesse, but the wickednesse of life that maketh it odi|ous. Then hast thou occasion (wretched man) as thou arte to learne thee, who hauing sinned in the excesse, oughtest rightly to haue thy comforts in defect. Yea I haue sinned O ye heauens, first in beguiling this chast <HI>Margarita</HI> with hope&punc; in wronging my deere parents in their age, in slaughtering this poore infant with his mother. Oh <HI>AEtna</HI> of miseries
<PB REF="47">
that I see! oh ye <HI>Cuscan</HI> princes, why suffer you me aliue, that haue stained your empire with such infamies? why vn|sheath you not your swords? for pitie delay not, for pittie rid me of life: alas, why craue I pittie, that haue beene altoge|ther pittilesse? ah yee flockes of flatterers, where are you nowe that fedde me with follies? come nowe and punish my follies in me: none heareth me, all forsake me, despised of the gods, hated of men; ah iust heauens, I honour you that haue left mee occasions in my selfe, you cursed eies of mine that haue glutted your selues in vanitie, since you reft me of my senses, I will be reuenged on your sight: which saide, hee drew out his eies weeping piteously in so erneful maner, that the whole assistance became compassionate: at last some one of his nobles labouring to pacifie him, alleadging reasons of great weight, which in a man of gouernement were sufficient to quallifie the furie of sorrow, he replied thus: Friends and princes the force of reason, (as the Stoicks say) is not to bee vsed in those things that are not, it concerneth not me (lords) that I liue, perswade me not for that cause to entertaine and thinke of life, for if it be odious to those that through infirmi|ties of their flesh grow in hate with it, what should it be to me, who haue not onely a bodie aggreeued with sorrowes, but a soule sweltered in sinnes; lament mee not therefore, neither releeue me; for as the dewe causeth leprosie in man though it yeeldeth life to floures, so teares rather torment those that dispaire then releeue them; and though they com|fort the distressed, yet they are tedious to the desperate: I feele my forlorne heart (you nobles) cloyed with thoughtes and longing to be disburthened. I see with mine inward eies the ghosts of these poore slaughtered soules calling for iustice at my hands; stay me not therefore from death, but assist me to die, for by this meanes you shall ridde your countrey of a plague, the world of a monster. Such as are wounded with brasen weapons, are according to <HI>Aristotles</HI> opinion soone healed; so likewise are they that are tainted with easie sor|row: but whereas the passions exceede reason, they haue no issue but death; the instrument that woundeth is deadly. Ah my heart, I finde <HI>Plutarchs</HI> reason of force; for as the sunne
<PB REF="47">
is to the heauen, so is the heart to the man; and as the one e|clipseth, the other cloudeth; when the one danceth, the other dieth. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eele thee (poore heart) dispossest of al ioy, and shal I continue possest of life? no (you ghosts) I will visit you. This saide, he grapled about the floore among the dead bo|dies, and at last he griped that weapon wherewith he slew <HI>Margarita,</HI> wherewith piercing his hated bodie he breathed his last, to the generall benefit of all the <HI>Cuscans</HI> who in that they would pacifie the emperour <HI>Protomachus,</HI> who as they vnderstoode had leuied a huge armie after they had enterred their slaine emperour with his faire loue, bestowed honoura|ble funerall on the princesse <HI>Margarita,</HI> on whose sepulchre, as also on that of <HI>Dian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es, Arsinous</HI> wrote these epitaphs&punc;</P>
